1610031,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,B00AFEY354,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[1, 1]","The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a tender drama from start to finish. This movie is beautifully acted, beautifully written, and beautifully directed. This movie is based on a young adult novel of the same name. I never read the book but the guy who penned the novel also wrote the screenplay and directed this film, Stephen Chbosky. Chbosky is a gifted storyteller and visionary. I love how this film is set in the early 90's, I love the music, I love how much this film has heart. They sure don't make films like this anymore! Logan Lerman who plays Charlie gives a tour-de-force performance. His body language and eyes tell so much even when he's not uttering a single word. Charlie is a shy, high school freshman. He is suffering from depression, at first you think he's sullen because he is dealing with the suicide death of his best friend, but then once you get deeper into his past...you begin to realize he is struggling with a lot of childhood demons and blocked memories. Emma Watson (love her American accent) and Ezra Miller also star. Their characters, Patrick and Sam take Charlie under their wing, and try to help him break out of his shell. Paul Rudd and Joan Cusack have small roles as well, but very important roles I might add. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a film that you will enjoy watching again and again. This film made me cry, it made me laugh, and it made me think about my days as a shy, insecure teenager. I highly recommend this gorgeous coming-of-age film, you won't be disappointed.

1610033,ATHNYP7D3RW1A,B00AFEY354,A. Gavin,"[2, 2]","This film adaption is very faithful. Perhaps not so surprising because the author wrote and directed it! This is tremendously rare. It's unusual enough for an author to write his own adaption (I'm doing it for Untimed, but I'll dance the Snoopy dance if I can even get it produced, and set off fireworks if I land any kind of production roll. Actually directing it? That's a serious wet dream.)As a stand alone film, this is an excellent contribution to the teen angst drama. It's also funny at times. Not so much as the amazing Adventureland, but more serious and just different. Way better than the putrescent likes of Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist.The acting is excellent. It's been obvious since Prisoner of Azkaban that Emma Watson would end up a serious babe. She's got looks, spunk, smarts, and charisma all locked down. Ezra Miller is also a standout as Patrick. The two of them have so much life in them that they overshadow Charlie -- he is, after all, a wallflower. Nina Dobrev (also a favorite of mine, but not as good an actress as Emma) has a small role as Charlie's sister. The part has a different feel than in the novel, nicer for the most part. Paul Rudd is good (albeit the part is a bit forced) as the teacher.The film doesn't go out of its way to reveal the time and place. As I saw it cold, not knowing anything about the story, I had to come to the gradual conclusion (based on music, costumes, lack of computers, etc) that this was the late 80s or early 90s. It was the presence of certain Nirvana songs that cinched the early 90s vibe.The film strips out a lot of little details about Charlie's family. This is to be expected, as in adaption, even of a short novel like this, something has to go. These changes thin out the parents and sister to cut outs. Sad, but there really isn't much else Chbosky could have done. He also stripped out most of the sexuality. A producer generated change? Probably, but the I liked the sudden dashes of it in the novel. A few of those tidbits stuck with me. But most importantly, the de-sexualization washed out the ""twist."" It was so subtly handled in the film for fear of offending that I half-missed it, only fully realizing after the credits.There are also subtle character shifts. Charlie is a little more passive and trending toward schizophrenic in the novel. Sam a little more broken in the film. The sister is meaner in the book (although she comes around). It's hard to say how much of this is in the writing and how much is what the actors bring to bear. Some characters, like Patrick (who really is a great character), come through 110%.Overall, if you like teen films (and I do), see this one. It's several standard deviations above the mean.Andy Gavin, author of The Darkening Dream and Untimed",5,Teen Flick like they used to make,1363824000,"03 21, 2013",2013,2772,"['film', 'adaption', 'very', 'faithful', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'so', 'surprising', 'author', 'wrote', 'directed', 'tremendously', 'rare', 'unusual', 'enough', 'author', 'write', 'own', 'adaption', ""'m"", 'doing', 'Untimed', ""'ll"", 'dance', 'Snoopy', 'dance', 'can', 'even', 'get', 'produced', 'set', 'off', 'fireworks', 'land', 'kind', 'production', 'roll', 'Actually', 'directing', 'serious', 'wet', 'dream', 'stand', 'alone', 'film', 'excellent', 'contribution', 'teen', 'angst', 'drama', 'also', 'funny', 'times', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'amazing', 'Adventureland', 'more', 'serious', 'just', 'different', 'Way', 'better', 'putrescent', 'likes', 'Nick', 'Norah', 'Infinite', 'Playlist.The', 'acting', 'excellent', 'been', 'obvious', 'Prisoner', 'Azkaban', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'serious', 'babe', 'got', 'looks', 'spunk', 'smarts', 'charisma', 'locked', 'down', 'Ezra', 'Miller', 'also', 'standout', 'Patrick', 'two', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'life', 'overshadow', 'Charlie', 'wallflower', 'Nina', 'Dobrev', 'also', 'favorite', 'mine', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'actress', 'Emma', 'small', 'role', 'Charlie', 'sister', 'part', 'different', 'feel', 'novel', 'nicer', 'most', 'part', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'good', 'part', 'bit', 'forced', 'teacher.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'go', 'out', 'way', 'reveal', 'time', 'place', 'saw', 'cold', 'not', 'knowing', 'anything', 'story', 'had', 'come', 'gradual', 'conclusion', 'based', 'music', 'costumes', 'lack', 'computers', 'etc', 'was', 'late', '80s', 'early', '90s', 'was', 'presence', 'certain', 'Nirvana', 'songs', 'cinched', 'early', '90s', 'vibe.The', 'film', 'out', 'lot', 'little', 'details', 'Charlie', 'family', 'be', 'expected', 'adaption', 'even', 'short', 'novel', 'something', 'go', 'changes', 'thin', 'out', 'parents', 'sister', 'cut', 'outs', 'Sad', 'there', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'else', 'Chbosky', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'also', 'stripped', 'out', 'most', 'sexuality', 'producer', 'generated', 'change', 'Probably', 'liked', 'sudden', 'dashes', 'novel', 'few', 'tidbits', 'stuck', 'most', 'importantly', 'de-sexualization', 'washed', 'out', 'twist', 'was', 'so', 'subtly', 'handled', 'film', 'fear', 'offending', 'half-missed', 'only', 'fully', 'realizing', 'credits.There', 'are', 'also', 'subtle', 'character', 'shifts', 'Charlie', 'little', 'more', 'passive', 'trending', 'schizophrenic', 'novel', 'Sam', 'little', 'more', 'broken', 'film', 'sister', 'meaner', 'book', 'around', 'hard', 'say', 'how', 'much', 'writing', 'how', 'much', 'what', 'actors', 'bring', 'bear', 'characters', 'Patrick', 'who', 'really', 'great', 'character', 'come', '110', '%', '.Overall', 'like', 'teen', 'films', 'do', 'see', 'one', 'several', 'standard', 'deviations', 'mean.Andy', 'Gavin', 'author', 'Darkening', 'Dream', 'Untimed']",N/A

The gay agenda was the same though: flamboyant, always funny and morally perfect gay guy, closeted gay guy (demonized) and moronic straight guys who must beat up the gay guy. Please, this is the gay Agenda. Why can't there ever be a gay guy, pretty basic, who is proud to be gay but doesn't feel the need to mention it 200 times a day? Also, the closeted gay guy's father has to beat him up when he finds out his son is gay. Not every father reacts this way. Come on. However, Ezra Miller (who in real life is gay) is a fantastic actor when he is not just being the stereotype. He was great in ""We have to talk about Kevin,"" with Tilda Swinton, who was also impressive. He stole the show. Emma Watson was somewhat flat in her role, although I really wanted to like her more. the main character (I forget his name) was good, but not compelling. The dialogue here was great! I am of an older generation, so I really don't know what goes on now in High School. Yet, I was angered by the way drug use, and sneaking powerful illegal drugs into a character ""for laughs"" was handled. This is no laughing matter! It's an assault and a crime.  I am also old enough to disapprove of the underage drinking, although this is as old as the hills. I love Ezra Miller.

And if you think that, then I feel sorry for you; if all young adult (YA)/teen movies were this great, I'd be respecting the genre a lot more.  Writer/director Stephen Chbosky's coming-of-age film perfectly captures the teen angst and solitude that comes with being a teenage introvert; it should be noted that while there is angst, awkwardness and solitude in this film, there is also laughs, heart and, most of all, hope. Although romantic love does have its prominent place in this film, it is a universal love that exudes from the story. And do not let that deter you from this wonderful film! I have to admit that seeing protagonist Logan Lerman's Charlie's beginning moments of the film, I couldn't help but think ""I WAS that kid!"" (thankfully, though, I did not have his issue, which is a major plot point) -- the awkwardness, the quiet, the not-fitting-in, no friends, and the importance, passion and art of making mixed tapes!

I remembered thinking how the incredible number of ""bad things"" that happened to one person should have tipped me off - ever single issue from every afterschool special was there!That's what I feel about Chbosky's ""semi-autobiographical"" story, and I've only seen the movie, so I missed the witnessing-a-rape, abortion etc issues from the book!  Are these important issues? Yes, certainly, but if you throw them all in at once, you kind of dilute the effect they're supposed to have.I found the situations unrealistic - Charlie is supposed to be 14/15. How does he get to hang out with seniors (especially if he's supposed to be a wallflower?) and let's not forget that boys don't mature physically as quickly as girls do - so a Harvard-bound senior wants to be his girlfriend? Really? And her aggressive pursuit of him does not give him flashbacks to unwanted sexual advances his aunt subjected him to - again, really?Then there's the title; Charlie is too in-demand to be a wallflower. The film takes itself too seriously: we're supposed to sneer at the line ""poetry writes me!"" but ""I feel infinite!"" is OK? I tried to like this film, but I'd have to be the gullible young teenager who believed ""Go ask Alice"" was real to be able to do that.",2,Go ask Charlie,1363996800,"03 23, 2013",2013,1503,"['read', 'Go', 'Ask', 'Alice', 'young', 'teenager', 'was', 'deeply', 'disturbed', 'especially', 'was', 'touted', 'true', 'story', 'remember', 'being', 'shocked', 'learn', 'much', 'later', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'then', 'thinking', 'realised', 'how', 'incredibly', 'gullible', 'had', 'been', 'remembered', 'thinking', 'how', 'incredible', 'number', 'bad', 'things', 'happened', 'one', 'person', 'should', 'have', 'tipped', 'ever', 'single', 'issue', 'afterschool', 'special', 'was', 'there', 'what', 'feel', 'Chbosky', 'semi-autobiographical', 'story', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'movie', 'missed', 'witnessing-a-rape', 'abortion', 'etc', 'issues', 'book', 'Are', 'important', 'issues', 'Yes', 'certainly', 'throw', 'once', 'kind', 'dilute', 'effect', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'have.I', 'found', 'situations', 'unrealistic', 'Charlie', 'supposed', 'be', '14/15', 'How', 'get', 'hang', 'out', 'seniors', 'especially', 'supposed', 'be', 'wallflower', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'boys', 'do', ""n't"", 'mature', 'physically', 'as', 'quickly', 'girls', 'do', 'so', 'Harvard-bound', 'senior', 'be', 'girlfriend', 'Really', 'aggressive', 'pursuit', 'not', 'give', 'flashbacks', 'unwanted', 'sexual', 'advances', 'aunt', 'subjected', 'again', 'really', 'Then', 'title', 'Charlie', 'too', 'in-demand', 'be', 'wallflower', 'film', 'too', 'seriously', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'sneer', 'line', 'poetry', 'feel', 'infinite', 'OK', 'tried', 'like', 'film', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'gullible', 'young', 'teenager', 'who', 'believed', 'Go', 'ask', 'Alice', 'was', 'real', 'be', 'able', 'do']",N/A

1610105,A33ALGBSJETJ96,B00AFEY354,"chrissy ""chrissy""","[2, 2]","I just got out of the theater and watched Perks of Being a Wallflower.  While I was not expecting anything more than your average typical teen film, I was pleasantly surprised.  I have to admit I never read the book and have no intention of doing so.  In fact the only reason I went to see the movie because I absolutely adore Emma Watson.  This was apparently her first post potter filmThe movie takes place in Pittsburgh.  While I loved the tunnel scenes while they were driving in the truck and Sam(Emma Watson) was standing in the bed of the truck with the with blowing in her face and the bridge shots of the city.  Overall I was a bit disappointed that other than that there were really no scenes whatsoever in downtown Pittsburgh or interesting landscapes whatsoever, but apparently that is irrelevant to the movie's plot.Nevertheless, Logan Lerman(Charlie) who is the main character starts his freshman year knowing no one and is a loner.  He meets the tall gay gay with the long her who introduces him to his bevy of friends and makes him feel welcome by making a toast to him at a party making Logan feel welcome.  One of those friends is the adorable Emma Watson(sam) who Logan is enamored with, but it starts with innocent friendship and common trust and similar abusive backgrounds which they can relate to.  Sam is dating an older college guy who is not really interested in Sam but just using her and Sam has had an abusive childhood of her own fraught with pain. Just like Charlie(Logan) who was also sexually assaulted and abused as a child and has left scars.  This makes their connection stronger.In other words these groups of friends become  Charlie's family and make him feel welcome, however they are all upperclassman and are ready to graduate while he is still a freshman and he will likely be a loner again. Charlie is into writing and wants to become a writer. Charlie briefly dates some annoying girl in the group of friends briefly but at a party decides on a dare to kiss the prettiest girl at the party and he of course kisses Emma Watson even though he is still sort of dating the annoying girl who is sitting right next to Logan as he sucks face with Emma.  Both girls are flabbergasted and confused and makes for another awkward evening with Charlie leaving.Later after Charlie breaks up with annoying girl and Sam invites him to her bedroom they have a real heart to heart about their past, exchanging of sentimental gifts(a typewriter she buys for Charlie's writing), and she tells him he is the only guy to has ever cared about her- helps her  by helping her improve her SATS to get into Penn State and  he seems to be in love with Sam and vice -versa.  Charlie soon tells her how he feels about her on her bed and kisses her and it kind of implies they have sexual intercourse but it is not really clear as the scene changes to the morning after to another scene.  Later during the film as Sam drives off before she gets into the truck apparently heading off for college her and Charlie kiss but it is not clear whether they are a couple or not which should have been made more apparent.Anyway fast forward the end of the school year , they part ways and Charlie begins to write about them who is a literature buff and sees his old upper hs friends when they come home from college. And things seem to be ""normal"" again.The reason this movie is interesting is because it deals with real issues such as friends who can fall in love, , dumping annoying girls, falling in love with an adolescent who you can relate to and the wrong people, jealousy, homosexuality, parties, drugs, cafeteria fights(which in this movie was ridiculous and unbelievable to say the least) and just about any other thing that one has encountered in high school at some juncture.Logan Lerman gives a great performance and the gay dude, but I particular applaud Emma Watson's performance because she plays the part of Sam so well with incredible motion range who is very sentimental and cries at the right moments and truly seems to care about the characters and hardships in the movie, particular Charlie. She has a good American accent too! She is no longer Hermione Granger at all. A bit of a tear jerker towards the 2nd half of the movie and the movie especially hits hard home for any hs student who has any been a loner or a wallflower in love with the cute girl in school or anyone who has never really felt they belong in those awkward adolescent teen years which is practically everyone.My only slight complaint was the ending. It seemed sort of rushed, incomplete, with all sorts of loose ends untied lacking deep emotion - mainly between Logan and Sam.  We never really get a sense if anything will ever happen in the long run with Sam and Charlie or how deeply they feel for one another(except the bedroom scene where they kiss) upon seeing each other in a diner when Sam is home on college break where the empathetic connection seems to be lacking between the two and one is left dumbfounded as to how they feel for one another.  I was definitely hoping for a more profound touching ending that made one think long and hard after the movie when the credits rolled and that was not the case for me anyway.  And Paul Rudd gives a perfunctory bland performance as he does in all his roles.Otherwise pretty pleased with the movie.

1610112,A3D9AL7ENJ1I20,B00AFEY354,clay,"[1, 2]","I was a bit reluctant to write about this film as I am the 914th reviewer.I thought at first what's the point, but I loved it so much I thought it was worth offering up my perspective.I must point out I haven't read the book.Having said that my enjoyment of a film adaptation,not having read the book, for me, is sometimes an advantage, as more often than not I find the film disappointing.I must admit however, that this is not always the case.This film also, reminded me of the John Hughes films of the 80's.Most specifically 'The Breakfast Club' dealing with a few young misfits or should I say quirky,shy unique individuals who have their own private fears about starting or being in high school.While dealing with their own private demons and social issues they are thrown together, or in this film's case are drawn to each other, to try and survive and navigate the minefield that is high school.Combine this with a brilliant soundtrack and you have the ingredients of a classic feelgood movie where at the end you think to yourself what a fantastic film.I got the same feeling from 'The Shawshank Redemption' and 'Almost Famous' to name a couple.Speaking of the soundtrack there's a classic scene just after the beginning when Charlie,Sam(Emma Watson)and Patrick (Ezra Miller) are driving somewhere and they hear what Sam describes as 'the perfect' song on the radio.None of them know the song.This compels Sam to implore Patrick to take the tunnel.Sam finds out the name of ""the tunnel song"" at the end of the film.A classic song by a legend in the music industry,which made me feel a bit old ,much to my dismay.They go through the tunnel again with that song playing .Their characters have evolved so much and as a result they are so much closer and after having been through so much together, Charlie says in his narration ""and in this moment we are infinite"" this final scene compared to the same scene at the beginning brings a tear to the eye.I won't go into what happens in the film as in my opinion a good review hints at the possibilities that the film may offer up.I will however touch on certain points which will give you an idea of what goes on.Lets face it,if you haven't already seen it or read the book and after the 900 or so reviewers before me you must know what its about anyway.I thought Logan Lerman's performance as Charlie was brilliant.His character arc was very well told.You are given a hint  near the beginning that he has a buried childhood trauma, which as the story unfolds makes you realize in subtle ways that this is affecting the way he reacts and responds in certain situations.It works to his advantage however in a cafeteria confrontation which helps redeem his status with his friends,especially Emma Watson's character, after having been ostracised from the group for a couple of weeks due to a social faux pas.I could relate to Charlie's character as I too was very shy in my early teens.Starting High School for me in 1970 in an all boys public school in Australia was very scary.The school was a survival of the fittest situation which was really shoved down my throat on the first day, when two fourth formers (year 10)got into a fight where one was carted off to hospital and the other one was covered in a fair bit of blood.Anyway,I digress.The way the film deals with complex adolescent issues such as homosexuality,drug use,violence,suicide and family is dealt with very well and by the end of the film you are left with a feeling of content as these characters help each other mature,evolve and grow strong together as they rise above and get closure from the baggage of their past.The scene where Charlie gets ""baked"" at a party,comes out of his shell and lets fly with a few home truths about the main characters' and high school in general is a classic.Soon after this he tells Sam about his best friends demise,she tells Patrick (scene stealer Ezra Miller)and he immediately gets accepted into the group after which Sam welcomes him ""to the island of misfit toys"" , the film takes off from there.I must mention the subtle but standout performance of Paul Rudd as Charlie's English teacher.This is a classic case of less is more as this actor has lately starred in over the top comedys'.He manages to encourage Charlie without pushing him as he sees the potential the budding young writer has.This is going in my collection as I thoroughly enjoyed it and you should too if you haven't already.",5,Brilliant film,1376697600,"08 17,

Stephen Chbosky solves that problem by not only writing the script but directing it as well.  ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" brings a new perspective to the age old theme of fitting in at high school.  The solution to that of course is not so much fitting in but finding a group of iconoclasts who will accept you quirks and all.  The film set in Pittsburgh sometime in the mid-Eighties focuses on a shy freshman, Charlie (Logan Lerman), who prior to entering his new school had a nervous breakdown.  He is befriended by a pair of upperclassmen, the free-spirited Sam (Emma Watson) and her flamboyant stepbrother, Patrick(Ezra Miller).  The bond the three share is they've had life events that nobody their age should experience.  The film demonstrates the ecstasy and joy of youth as well as the pain and heartache of those tender years.  There is the music, parties, and celebrations none more extravagant than audience participation at the ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" to distract them until college beckons.  What I liked about the film is the kids are intelligent but not beyond their years.  The adults in their lives are sympathetic none moreso than Mr. Anderson(Paul Rudd), an English teacher who offers Charlie encouragement.  All three lead teens are impeccable in their roles.

And when it tries to focus too much on the pop culture of that era, it fails miserably.But when I found out that ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"", a popular novel by Stephen Chbosky, was being made into the film and was being written and directed by him, suffice to say, the film version was in good hands.Having watched the film, I don't know how thrilled I was after watching it, having grown up during this era and understand the music references but most of all, trying not too hard to be an early '90s film but leaving it to the viewer to know when it was set, everything worked out perfectly.But it's the casting that let to the efficacy of ""The Perks of Being a Wall Flower"".  The three main talents in the film, Logan Lerman, Emma Watson and Ezra Miller were wonderfully cast.  Yes, I know Time Magazine's Richard Corliss was not too thrilled about 20-year-olds being cast as teenagers but for this film, these young talent look so young that they can pass as teenagers quite easily.What I enjoyed about this film is that this is no perfect set of teenagers that live happy lives.  These teenagers seem themselves as a group of misfits.  Charlie is a teenager who is shy, always bullied, never had many friends but also a past that he is starting to discover through flashbacks in his mind.But because he enjoys his friends, never was a judgmental person and takes things how the way they are, it's what makes him special because he's a genuine person that listens, cares despite being living a life of loneliness.His friends Sam, is beautiful but also a person who wants to change her life around.  Not being this girl who has reputation of sleeping around with men but when she meets Charlie, for the first time, a guy respects her and doesn't care about her past or what life she had lived.  He respects her for what she is now and it's one thing that she has never experienced from a person.And there is Patrick, the class clown, he does get into trouble a bit, but within his friends, he cares for them deeply.  He also is a homosexual in a secret relationship with the quarterback of the football team.And the things that these characters deal with and what makes them awkward and why they don't fit in with the popular cliques but yet, they have their own group of wallflowers and it's this friendship that keeps them going.While I did have reservations of Chbosky directing the film (because his experience is writing for novels and television), there is no one in this world that could have brought this film to the big screen except him.  Just listening to his audio commentary and the special features, things had to be right in this film.  From the casting to overall chemistry and the vision he had for this film essentially came to life because the tone he set for his talent but also letting them live together during the filming of the movie and in that process, he realized he had something special.From the supporting characters within the wallflower group to the adults featured in the film, he wanted a family atmosphere and in the end, he was able to get amazing chemistry from the young talent and this film shows how that chemistry works amazingly well.And while the film does have its differences from the book, there were things added on this Blu-ray.  For example, the poem that was featured in the book.  Chbosky knew that the poem would not make it into the film, but he shot it anyway and included it on the Blu-ray.  Scenes that involve Charlie's parents to an extended scene of the prom photos.  Chbosky knew that the young talent never experienced the prom before, because of their careers.  So, he wanted them to experience the feel of a prom, photos and everything, for their benefit to have that experience.Rarely do you see a filmmaker go all out for their talent like this, but he understood the chemistry of his young talent but also knowing things that fans of the novel would probably like to see on the Blu-ray, so, there are couple of special features plus audio commentary that fans of the film will enjoy.And picture quality and the lossless soundtrack is very good on Blu-ray and for the most part, I think that fans of the film should be quite pleased with this release.Overall, ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is fantastic film, wonderful adaptation of Chbosky's novel and great casting.  Logan Lerman, Emma Watson and Ezra Miller are absolutely wonderful chemistry and it's a coming-of-age film that I highly recommend!",4,"""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is fantastic film, wonderful

A lighthouse abiding at the eleventh hour of youth, but are we to befacilitated or blinded by the light?This is evergreen film-making which, despite minor creases, is destined for bothHearts and top-shelves. It prevails without feigning intellectual or &#34;artsy&#34; complexity.It doesn't need to be revolutionary or deeply insightful into the characters.The film glows with the charm, warmth, sincerity, charisma, and golden chemistry of the leads.It's not simply their good looks, but the rare occurrence of something magical on and off-set which catalysed the emotional embrace of this tale - a tale which is sometimes understated and at times, underlined in bold. A sound balance ensues between heartache and euphoria, and in the fullness of time we are subtly floored.There are echoes of a myriad of High school classics: the chance meeting of strangers who magically bond as if by destiny as in Hughe's charming bittersweet BREAKFAST CLUB (1985), glimpses into the sadness of High school experience such as bullying, peer-pressure, prejudice and self-deception as in HEATHERS (1988), honestly portrayed teen homosexuality as in the glorious MY SO CALLED LIFE (1994), faint hues of the grim beauty and gravity of RIVER'S EDGE (1986), or the dark, maddening, nightmarish incest of THE BUTTERLY EFFECT (2004). Yet PERKS still stands as unique.EZRA MILLER'S diverse talents soar on skyward - I loved him in this almost as much as in WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN (2011). LOGAN'S resemblance of a cherub-esque CHRISTIAN SLATER holds well with the 90s/80s nostalgia. This didn't strike me as a performance-heavy script yet to their credit everyone played wonderfully.The twin &#34;flying&#34; sequences in Pittsburgh`s FORT PITT tunnel are resplendent and emancipating - sweet camerawork, lighting and performances.Tasteful, earnest and touching approach to teen homosexuality with a cool parallelbetween the Jock's repression of his homosexuality and another character's repression of being abused in childhood.When the story shifts focus to the abuse and incest it does so without being too graphic and this meshes well with the overall tone of the film, as well as heightening emotions. Though moved, I felt a tad disappointed by the victim's institutionalization and his apparent helplessness outside of &#34;the system&#34; as it were. It seemed pro-psychiatry, although this may have simply been a re-tellingof actual facts (parts of Chbosky's book are based on real life).Even so it all worked for me, particularly by the end.The ethereal rock masterwork PEARLY-DEWDROPS' DROPS (1984) is a strong contenderfor tunnel song and should at least have played far more prominently and audibly on the score. As it stands it was slightly drowned in background obscurity and ambience, which is quite a shame since it is arguably the stand-out song on the entire Soundtrack.Chbosky on his commentary seemed keen to someday re-release a PERKS in an extendedform, so I genuinely hope some of the fans modest suggestions, such as mine, might be incorporated.Remembering might be the first step to recovery, so I found it most intriguing that the victim's abuse memories resurface partly thanks to an LSD trip - now there's a POSITIVE drug story that you won't hear on the news as the late, great BILL HICKS might say!",3,SUMPTUOUS MOVIE ...,1401753600,"06 3, 2014",2014,3481,"['Chbosky', 'film', 'once', 'fleeting', 'farewell', 'shimmering', 'celebration.The', 'twinkling', 'eye', 'mundane', 'finite', 'briefly', 'encountersthe', 'infinite', 'lighthouse', 'abiding', 'eleventh', 'hour', 'youth', 'are', 'befacilitated', 'blinded', 'light', 'evergreen', 'film-making', 'minor', 'creases', 'destined', 'bothHearts', 'top-shelves', 'feigning', 'intellectual', '34', 'artsy', '34', 'complexity.It', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'revolutionary', 'deeply', 'insightful', 'characters.The', 'film', 'glows', 'charm', 'warmth', 'sincerity', 'charisma', 'golden', 'chemistry', 'leads.It', 'not', 'simply', 'good', 'looks', 'rare', 'occurrence', 'something', 'magical', 'off-set', 'catalysed', 'emotional', 'embrace', 'tale', 'tale', 'sometimes', 'understated', 'times', 'underlined', 'bold', 'sound', 'balance', 'ensues', 'heartache', 'euphoria', 'fullness', 'time', 'are', 'subtly', 'floored.There', 'are', 'echoes', 'myriad', 'High', 'school', 'classics', 'chance', 'meeting', 'strangers', 'who', 'magically', 'bond', 'destiny', 'Hughe', 'charming', 'bittersweet', 'BREAKFAST', 'CLUB', '1985', 'sadness', 'High', 'school', 'experience', 'such', 'bullying', 'peer-pressure', 'prejudice', 'self-deception', 'HEATHERS', '1988', 'honestly', 'portrayed', 'teen', 'homosexuality', 'glorious', 'MY', 'SO', 'CALLED', 'LIFE', '1994', 'faint', 'hues', 'grim', 'beauty', 'gravity', 'RIVER', 'EDGE', '1986', 'dark', 'maddening', 'nightmarish', 'incest', 'THE', 'BUTTERLY', 'EFFECT', '2004', 'PERKS', 'still', 'unique.EZRA', 'MILLER', 'diverse', 'talents', 'soar', 'skyward', 'loved', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'WE', 'NEED', 'TO', 'TALK', 'ABOUT', 'KEVIN', '2011', 'LOGAN', 'resemblance', 'cherub-esque', 'CHRISTIAN', 'SLATER', 'well', '90s/80s', 'nostalgia', 'did', ""n't"", 'strike', 'performance-heavy', 'script', 'yet', 'credit', 'everyone', 'played', 'wonderfully.The', 'twin', '34', 'flying', '34', 'sequences', 'Pittsburgh', 's', 'FORT', 'PITT', 'tunnel', 'are', 'resplendent', 'emancipating', 'sweet', 'camerawork', 'lighting', 'performances.Tasteful', 'earnest', 'touching', 'approach', 'teen', 'homosexuality', 'cool', 'parallelbetween', 'Jock', 'repression', 'homosexuality', 'character', 'repression', 'being', 'abused', 'childhood.When', 'story', 'shifts', 'focus', 'abuse', 'incest', 'so', 'being', 'too', 'graphic', 'meshes', 'well', 'overall', 'tone', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'heightening', 'emotions', 'moved', 'felt', 'tad', 'disappointed', 'victim', 'institutionalization', 'apparent', 'helplessness', '34', 'system', '34', 'were', 'seemed', 'pro-psychiatry', 'may', 'have', 'simply', 'been', 're-tellingof', 'actual', 'facts', 'parts', 'Chbosky', 'book', 'are', 'based', 'real', 'life', '.Even', 'worked', 'particularly', 'end.The', 'ethereal', 'rock', 'masterwork', 'PEARLY-DEWDROPS', 'DROPS', '1984', 'strong', 'contenderfor', 'tunnel', 'song', 'should', 'least', 'have', 'played', 'far', 'more', 'prominently', 'audibly', 'score', 'was', 'slightly', 'drowned', 'background', 'obscurity', 'ambience', 'quite', 'shame', 'arguably', 'stand-out', 'song', 'entire', 'Soundtrack.Chbosky', 'commentary', 'seemed', 'keen', 'someday', 're-release', 'PERKS', 'extendedform', 'genuinely', 'hope', 'fans', 'modest', 'suggestions', 'such', 'mine', 'might', 'be', 'incorporated.Remembering', 'might', 'be', 'first', 'step', 'recovery', 'found', 'most', 'intriguing', 'victim', 'abuse', 'resurface', 'partly', 'thanks', 'LSD', 'trip', 'now', 'POSITIVE', 'drug', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hear', 'news', 'late', 'great', 'BILL', 'HICKS', 'might', 'say']",N/A

Hagy ""DHagy &#34;movie goer&#34;""","[1, 1]","""Perks"" is an absolutely stunning movie to watch, to feel--to just let yourself go and feel all the feelings any teenager has ever experienced in life.  Based on the novel of the same name (written by Stephen Chbosky), I was hopelessly hooked from the very start of the movie.The main character Charlie (brilliantly played by Logan Lerman) is fitfully anticipating his first day at school as a...FRESHMAN.  He doesn't know too many people at his high school; the few he may know treat him very badly.  And what makes it even worse, is that Charlie is not your typical Freshman.  Mature way beyond most of his classmates, he loves to read, he actually seems to enjoy school, and that makes his ""fresh meat"" for the bullying types.  He and his English teacher (wonderfully underplayed by Paul Rudd) seem to hit it off almost immediately, but Charlie is in search of a different kind of friend.  This happens when he meets Patrick (played by Ezra Miller) during (of all things) Shop Class.  He then meets Patrick's step-sister Sam (superbly played by Emma Stone).  Through both of them, Charlie is introduced to a much older, much more sophisticated crowd.  But through all of this, Charlie is harboring some very dark, deeply hidden secret.I cannot remember the last time I watched a movie and didn't look at the timer on the television to see how long it had been playing.  I also don't remember a movie that made me smile so much and feel so much for its characters.  I would have given anything to have been introduced to high school characters like Patrick and Sam.  The 80s had its ""Breakfast Club,"" now this day and age has its ""Perks.""  To say I loved this movie would be a huge understatement.Rated PG-13 for adult content, the movie runs 103 Minutes.

1610143,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00AFEY354,Doug Park,"[1, 1]","{4.5 stars}THE PERKS of BEING a WALLFLOWER is extremely poignant, well-acted, and well-filmed. It begins, I think deliberately, with the usual clich&eacute;s and stereotypes of high school existence: Charlie the shy little freshman getting his class copy of TO KILL a MOCKINGBIRD ripped up by an arrogant senior, Charlie sitting alone during the big prom, etc. It quickly evolves, however, into something much more unique and convincing. Emma Watson and Ezra Miller particularly shine as Charlie's new friends, found seemingly by accident (as they often are), and their entire weird artsy kids' circle is SO immediately engrossing and believable.Understandably, many comparisons have been made withThe Breakfast Club, and, though PERKS is also set in the age of cassette tapes and typewriters, it appeals to the heart in the same timeless way, making it another film that's likely to survive and be watched many years from now.PERKS is not flawless. Elements such as sister Candace's tumultuous relationship with ""Ponytail Derek,"" Charlie's abuse as a child at the hands of his now-deceased aunt, and Charlie's mental illness don't always interrelate or seem to play significant roles in the story. Various details--e.g., while this is supposedly set in 1991-2, home computers are still apparently unknown--are also out of whack. Yet, these factors do not appear to bother many other people, and  PERKS is a good enough film that even the imperfections serve to humanize and perhaps even make it better.

As the action unfolds, however, so Stephen Chbosky's film - based on his own book - becomes a lot more complex in terms of content.  We learn that Charlie and Sam's lives are intertwined in several ways, not all of them pleasant; they both had traumatic childhoods.  Although ostensibly destined to be together, they cannot make that final step until the final reel.  Likewise Patrick has to cope with the stress of having a relationship with Brad (Johnny Simmons) that is based on secrecy: Brad cannot admit his sexuality to himself, his friends or his father.  THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER shows in meticulous detail just how difficult it can be to negotiate high school, especially in cultures that value conformity and find difference extremely hard to handle.  The film has a shocking ending, where we discover the truth about Charlie's life, and why he has been so introverted in the past.  No one, it seems, has been prepared to listen to him, least of all his family and friends.  The three protagonists are excellent in their roles, showing a technical and emotional range, especially when it comes to depicting repressed emotion.

1610152,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00AFEY354,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER (Writ./Prod./Dir. Stephen Chbosky 2012, 103 minutes, based on his novelThe Perks of Being a Wallflower) In some ways, at first this film frightened me.Some films are virtually impossible to review beyond a certain technical, artistic viewpoint. Since I know this wonderful, interesting, emotionally intense and very tasteful film is set in the 1991-1992 school year, I will begin by complaining that we aren't really told that in any way, shape or form. The anachronisms notwithstanding (no cell phones means nothing to me, but I noticed kids handing cassettes around instead of ""burned"" CDs) I could not discern this was set so far in the past.The stunningly beautiful, skilled and most competent trio of Logan Lerman as Charlie-the-high-school-freshman, Emma Watson as Sam, and famously gay Ezra Miller as Patrick (both seniors) struck me as off-putting at first.I can tell you, though I'm far too old to have been in or even near any school at the time this is set, NO ONE as gorgeous, interesting and charismatic as these three would ever be ""wallflowers"" anywhere at any time. Outcastes almost certainly, but then that is self-inflicted.While Charlie is something of a mental case (we discover why at the end of the movie which I also found annoying), Patrick is as gay as the day is long, as is the actor who plays him is in real life. With a painful situation developing in his secret relationship with school jock Brad (Johnny Simmons), Miller brings a sweet, aching honesty to his portrayal of the perpetually clowning Patrick - and indeed, all the actors here absolutely swept me off my feet.Samantha is sweet, alluring and just way too stunning to be a high school senior; of course Watson was 21 here, a pro model, and had long since finished her stint at Brown University in real life - naturally resuming her extensive photo-model career.The highly touted makeout scene between Lerman and Watson, while quite lovely, had nothing on the gay kiss shared by Lerman and Miller. In a scene I found touching, tear-inducing and very real, Patrick stares into Charlie's eyes as he speaks of finding the right boy and the kiss just happens. The two seemed very natural and even content at this sad, aching moment - a big difference from the terrible nervousness both Lerman and Watson complained about experiencing during their kissing scene.The only thing I wonder, especially considering the era in which this is set: when did we go from raging Hollywoolly homophobia to almost total acceptance of gay kids? I can tell you, at the start of the 1990s, kids tried to be cool about the gay community, but it just wasn't happening.Gay kids were committing suicide or being put into mental institutions left and right. I'll NEVER forget the era because three of my friends committed suicide between 1990 and 1993. All three were high-school-aged.This film made me feel the anger of the stupidly idealized vision of a past that never existed. Even today the gay community has miles to go before it sleeps, if you take my meaning. Actually there you have it: not so much a coming-of-age film, because these kids are terribly aged already, but a coming-of-romance film that is too little seen these days. Or ever.They sure did not make movies like this in 1991 or 1992. And though I hate films that make me feel old, that insist on competing with music videos, and are shot by incompetent cinematographers, all that was pummeled into unconsciousness by the deep quality of this film.And I have to say it: Lerman can't act. He can stand before the camera and do his lines, scrunch up his face in pain etc., but he just can't act. It breaks my heart, but he has lots of time and roles awaiting him, so he can learn as he goes.The drug use offended me, but that's just me and I guess that will be here to stay for a long time as part of entering adulthood. It was odd to see the other kids kicking back like middle aged millionaires visiting the Playboy mansion, with only sweet young Charlie getting wasted, first on hash, later on something stronger. Also I was annoyed that I was never really sure in whose homes the scenes were set, unless it was clear the characters were at their individual homes.A few other things don't work in this movie. One is Charlie's letter-writing, which he's doing from the beginning. We do not know the addressee, but my guess is it's an exercise Charlie does rather than actually writing to anybody for real. At first I wondered if he was writing to his deceased aunt - but that is clearly not the case. Then, too, he refuses to divulge who he is in the first letter but halfway through he's signing the letters ""Charlie"".The thing I felt was a bit overdone and irritating was Charlie's narration of his own tale. We are to take it that he probably would not be the best person to tell his own story, and yet! Then the story simply stops. It doesn't end, much less end romantically - it just stops with Charlie complaining about how many days he has left to go in high school.The charm and humor I crowed about in reviewingThe Sasquatch Gangwas tried a lot here, but here it failed. The angst and love between friends was done very well. In spite of being derivative, I give it high marks for that.I just wondered how Emma Watson felt once again making up a screen trio with two other boys! Also she does a dazzling American accent, though there is one scene when it utterly fails her - I wonder if you'll catch that scene.I will add one observation: I think novelist/screenplay writer/director Chbosky must have read my friend Steve Berman's novelVintage: A Ghost Story(see my review). Though there's no film version of VINTAGE in sight, I've noticed a lot of films in recent years taking ideas liberally from Berman's great short novel.This was charmingly filmed on location in Upper St. Clair, Pennsylvania and in Pittsburgh; with the happily well-placed talents of Joan Cusack, Tom Savini (I LOVED seeing him again), Dylan McDermott and Paul Ruud.",4,"You accept the love you think

At Charlie's first party Patrick introduces him to two pretty Seniors, saying he expects Charlie to receive &#34;nice, meaningful heart-felt blowjobs from both of you&#34;.  They instead feed Charlie &#34;special&#34; brownies, and sit around laughing as Charlie waxes poetic on the subject of high school, who finishes with the observation, &#34;I just really want a milk shake.&#34; At the end of the party the Seniors present a touching toast to fellow-wallflower Charlie, saying &#34;We didn't think there was anyone cool left to meet.&#34; Sam looks into Charlie's eyes and purrs, &#34;Welcome to the island of misfit toys.&#34;I'd love to know how you feel when Sam tells Charlie at Christmas, &#34;I just want to make sure that the first person who kisses you truly loves you.&#34; And Charlie gets his first kiss. Magic. On the other hand Mary Elizabeth, an Overly Attached [self-appointed] Girl Friend introduces Charlie to second base, but their breakup alienates Charlie from the group until Patrick gets beaten by some high school jocks.

I loved it!Logan Lerman is great. By the end it started to remind me of Joseph Gordon-Levitt's early movie choices (i.e. Brick & The Lookout) and how I loved this quiet, quirky character.Emma Watson, didn't have a lot of ""acting"" opportunity in this movie (not her fault) and it could have nearly been any young woman actress in the role, but I felt her charisma kept me believing and liking her in the movie.Not being that familiar with Ezra Miller, I looked him up on IMDB and one of his first movie credits is playing a character listed as ""Big Bully"". Interesting to see how he is on the other side of things in more ways than one in this movie. Since his character is loud and then has these subtle sorrowful moments, he really shined in the movie and was a good opposite side of the spectrum from Logan's character of Charlie.The story is basically one school year's worth of story then part of the following year.

Every character has problems from a troubled past, some learn to cope and others cannot get past a tragic event. The themes for this movie is finding love, being accepted, learning to cope, and the true meaning of friendship.

1610180,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00AFEY354,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","Major question: why did this perfectly crafted, intelligently written and acted, touching little film not get nominated for an Oscar? It has all the ingredients of one of the finest films of the year - script based on the writer's own novel by the same name and directed by him, too - Stephen Chbosky - and a superb cast of young actors (and some excellent veteran actors such as Joan Cusack and Dylan McDermot and Paul Rudd, all playing against the slot roles into which others have stuck them), and makes many points about teenage angst and how the schism between teenagers and adults has become a chasm rarely navigable. But, as in current terminology, `go figure!'Very briefly, the story set in the early 1990s in Pittsburgh is about 15-year-old Charlie (20 year old Logan Lerman), an endearing and nave outsider, coping with first love, the suicide of his best friend, and his own mental illness while struggling to find a group of people with whom he belongs. The introvert freshman is taken under the wings of two seniors, Sam (22 year old Emma Watson) and Patrick (19 year old Ezra Miller), who are step-siblings and welcome him to the real world. Into this m&eacute;nage enter Brad (Johnny Simmons), the football hero who happens to be a deeply closeted gay boy in an affair with the openly gay Patrick, Charlie's sister Candace (Nina Dobrey) and her abusive boyfriend Ponytale Derek (Nicholas Braun), Charlie's parents (Dylan McDermott and Kate Walsh), the influential English teach Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd) and the psychiatrist Dr. Burton (Joan Cusack).The story is complex as Charlie writes to his `friend' and slowly reveals the secrets of his background that make him a loner `who finds loneliness unbearable, a friend who feels his friends deserve better than they get but cannot bring himself to feel that he does too. He can rise fiercely to the occasion when his friends are threatened but is as fragile as glass when the secrets he carries buried deep inside threaten to overwhelm him.' The manner in which each of the characters change in the course of this story manages to be at once credible as well as entertaining. This is a deeply touching film that deserves a very wide audience. One of the finest films of 2012.

1610187,A3RUMI4Y58S59,B00AFEY354,Heaven's Hound,"[1, 1]","I agree with another reviewer, Stephen Chbosky's film should have won several Oscars, from screenplay to directing to acting.  All three of the primary actors, Logan Lerman, Ezra Miller and Emma Watson were at their best in this film.  Logan Lerman's Charlie is miraculous.  For such a young actor to understand the power of minimalism is astonishing.  I've watched the film several times, and I can't help noticing Lerman's actorly stillness.  He knows that less is more, and because he seemingly does nothing, he inadvertently steals every scene he's in.  It's a good stealing because Lerman is not out to steal, his attention exquisitely focused on the other actors.  Their scenes are a fine example of ensemble acting.  No one is out to hog a scene.  Ezra Miller is an astounding actor who completely embodies the role of Patrick.  He was born for this role. Emma Watson is so believable as an American senior in high school, her British accent left in England.  And Logan Lerman, he too was born for the role of Charlie.  His acting is all in the face, in the eyes, in the mouth.  He actually listens to his friends, he looks at them, offering them himself in acts of exquisite attention, so it is no wonder that he knows exactly what to give them on Christmas. He knows his friends.  Yes, the major theme to Chbosky's film is friendship, beautifully underscored in three powerful scenes, the Kissing scenes.  The first scene involves Sam and Charlie.  Sam has been sexually abused by men and boys.  Her first kiss stolen by her father's boss when she was a mere girl.  She wants something far more magical for her friend Charlie.  She tells Charlie that she wants his first kiss to come from someone who loves him.  She loves him, a love the Greeks would call Philia (friendly).  When she kisses Charlie, she is not aware yet that Charlie's love for her is of another kind, what the Greeks would describe as Eros (romantic).  Later in the film, Sam and Charlie kiss again on Sam's bed, but this time both experience romantic love, Eros (erotic).  Then there is the kiss between Patrick and Charlie.In this scene, Patrick is dejected, for he has been rejected by his male lover Brad.  He wonders if he will ever meet and love a good man, and just as he articulates this, he turns and there sitting next to him is a good person.  And he impulsively kisses Charlie.  He instantly realizes his mistake and says, ""I'm sorry.""  But no problem.  Charlie accepts Patrick's display of love.  He has already been the recipient of love from both Patrick and his step-sister Sam.  It was Patrick who invited Charlie to sit with him at the football game.  It was Patrick and Sam who accepted Charlie on the dance floor, forming a circle while they danced.  It was Patrick and Sam who brought Charlie to his first party.  This brother and sister invited Charlie into life, urging him to ""participate.""  Charlie, therefore, loves them unconditionally, a love the Greeks call Agape.  Agapetic loves does not judge, it accepts another with no strings attached.  Charlie loves Patrick, and his response to Patrick's apology is simply, ""It's okay.""The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a beautiful film, and it will survive.  A Wonderful Life was not honored when it first came out, but it is now watched by millions every Christmas.  And what are the perks of being a wallflower?  To love and to be loved.

1610206,A1DK1YCVCXE6Q4,B00AFEY354,J. Deferbrache,"[8, 14]","I have not read ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"" so I have no basis as to how the book compares to the movie. That said, I feel that this film suffers the same symptoms as many a book adaptation: far too many elements stuffed in to be dealt with adequately in the space of a film. Many people on here have already mentioned a lot of the good points, so I would just like to point out some of the things that didn't sit well with me.First off, I would like to say that I really did enjoy the first half of this film and I was drawn in by the characters far more than I expected to be. To be honest, I tend to avoid films about adolescence because I often feel isolated by them. So many high school dramas involve hard bodies in the their early or mid or late twenties and are all about their wild sexual endeavors, making high school seem more like some supermodel Beverly Hills coke party. Unfortunately, my high school experience was not like that at all: riddled with anxiety, insecurity, disappointment (and not much of anything sexy). So this film opened as a very pleasant surprise, showing very realistic characters with legitimate angst and problems that I and probably many others could relate to. The teens of the film, particularly the leads, are embodied through great performances by very gifted young actors. I found myself smiling often, feeling their pain and enjoying their triumphs.In the second half, however, I felt that the film almost completely lost its trajectory: certain issues got dragged out far too long, there were scenes that went nowhere, and story elements completely abandoned. There were even times when the film completely lost its realism and delved into pure fantasy. (Warning: spoilers)Here is an example: at the beginning of the film, Charlie mentions to Sam that his former best friend committed suicide. This of course causes Sam concern and she and Patrick officially welcome him into their group. After that scene, the suicidal friend is never, ever mentioned again. I would think that of all the things that trouble Charlie's mind throughout the film, this friend would surely be one of them. Does Charlie ever wonder what his old friend would think of his new friends, what he would have been like in high school, what he would say about this or that? Does Charlie feel that he might possibly have prevented his friend's suicide and how he might have done it? If these things are on Charlie's mind, the movie never says. He does, however, think often on his deceased aunt and the possibility that her death might be his fault. I really feel that the movie should merely have focused on one of these defunct characters and left the other out. Couldn't he just have easily have told Sam that his aunt had died recently? I think that would have been much more consistent.The second half of the film is primarily focused on Charlie's attraction to Sam. He likes her, maybe she likes him, but she has a boyfriend. He likes her but later he has a girlfriend, which complicates things further. They share many special quiet moments together and even kiss once. Will they end up together, will they not end up together? Does she like him, does she not like him? This is so drawn out over so many similar scenes even though the conflict itself is pretty thin and it is perfectly obvious what the end result is going to be. Even with its focus on the alternative lifestyle of misfit adolescents, this film chooses as its main conflict a typical Jane Austen love game of ""will they end up together or not,"" hence qualifying it as a mainstream Hollywood film like the billion and a half others I have seen. Focusing on this issue again and again does not develop the characters any further, it is just teasing an attraction that everyone can see is there and is obviously going to be fulfilled in the end. I feel that there were far more interesting turns the movie could have taken and far more interesting issues it could have explored. For instance, the character of Patrick. Here is a gay teen who has to deal with the difficulty of finding love in a homophobic environment, something many a gay teen could no doubt relate to. After a very ugly breakup with his closeted boyfriend, Charlie tries to console Patrick. Patrick, in his grief, suddenly kisses Charlie full on the mouth. Charlie then mentions that he hangs out with Patrick quite a bit more after that in the following days. But wait a minute! Wouldn't your gay friend kissing you full on the mouth have some kind of impact on your relationship? Would it make your relationship stronger, would you understand each other better, would it make things more awkward and uncomfortable? The movie does absolutely nothing with this. Relationships between gay friends and straight friends (at least of the same gender) has very seldom been explored in movies, and I personally would have found that far more interesting then the typical Hollywood footsie between Charlie and Sam.Speaking of Patrick's closeted boyfriend, this is where I felt the movie really abandoned reality and went into fantasy. Patrick gets into an all out fight with his boyfriend in the middle of the school cafeteria. Two of the boyfriend's big jock buddies hold Patrick's arms while a third delivers merciless gut punches. Sam tries to run to his aid but is held back, so Charlie...Charlie apparently blacks out and when he comes to, he finds that he has knocked two jocks twice his size out cold. Are you kidding me??? I assume that the blackout must have been where he momentarily turned into the Incredible Hulk. This, for me, was just fully unrealistic. Bullying is a difficult fact of life that many an outsider has to put up with, and I have no doubt that millions of victims have had many a fantasy about laying out their stronger, dumber tormentors. But how many have ever actually done it? How many people can honestly say that they knocked not one, but two of these brutes unconscious? While it likely has happened before, I would say that very few of us would truthfully be able to relate to that experience. Charlie could certainly have tried to stop them, maybe even have succeeded in stopping them, I just wish it would have been done more realistically without the burst of super strength. And after such an amazing feat, wouldn't he be a school hero, a school legend? Well, it is enough for him to get his friends back, but otherwise everyone just seems to kind of forget about it...As the film unfolds, we see Charlie progressing more and more, becoming less of a wallflower, growing as a person, as a writer, confessing his love and apparently finally ending up with Sam and just as the movie seems that it is about to wrap itself up...a full relapse into depression and suicidal tendencies. This sudden change comes almost at the end of the film and to me it fit in very awkwardly. I thought if he was going to rebound into his depression it should have happened much earlier in the film and been a bigger part of his character. Why, after all the progress he made, does this suddenly happen? As he gets therapy, we learn that his relationship with his deceased aunt may not have been fully appropriate, kind of like Sam's prepubescent trauma with her dad's boss. Though the story seems to sympathize with these characters and their struggles, it tries to shove in this sort of uncouth, 1950's psychoanalytical explanation of why they are such ""misfits."" What makes someone an outsider? Being intelligent, being artistic or creative. NO, they were molested as children, of course! That just really seems like a cop out to me; an overly simplistic answer to very complicated issues. When you do not fit in it would almost be nice to have something like that to pin it on, kind of a free pass, but for many the answer is not so easy.To sum up, I really do understand why people like this movie and I do have to praise them for appealing to the kids for whom high school is not so fantastic. As I said, the actors gave it there all, they developed things well in the first half, but to me there were a lot of problems and let downs in the second half.",3,A good first half with a flawed

This story is the story of a young man entering high school, which has enough drama to carry a movie almost all the time, but it is taken to a whole other level by the dark undercurrent that ""something has happened"" to the young man just before he got there. Scenes of usual teenage angst are interposed with therapy journal writing and anti-psychotic pill taking.Set in the early 1980's, the movie expertly captures the free spirit of the day. (Beware parents - scenes of drug use abound... as they did in the 80s, of course.)

If you are a child of the 1980s and enjoyed John Hughes films, you will love this movie.  Take the best things about the 80s:  making mix tapes for people you like, going to dances, having your first crushes, dealing with insecurities and shyness, knowing deep secrets about the popular people in school, but then combine all of the dramatic scenes with very powerful performances, and you have a film that is just a great watch and will make you experience every emotion.  I laughed, teared up, felt sadness, and felt exuberance all in 1 hour and 42 minutes.  I will see again, and I am definitely going to add to my video library.

And hats off to Ezra Miller who did a wonderful job as Patrick. His character has made me come to a realization that all people, no matter who or what they are, should be accepted; that said,  I really loved his character in the movie.

1610229,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B00AFEY354,J. Richardson,"[1, 1]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.It&#8217;s hard to find a word to describe this movie other than &#8220;fantastic,&#8221; &#8220;great,&#8221; &#8220;powerful&#8221; or &#8220;amazing.&#8221; Which, now that I think about it, these are the same words that came to mind after reading the book. After I found out that Stephen Chbosky, the author of the book, was directing the movie I expected this to be one of the most legit film adaptions to date. I was expecting pretty much a line for line recreation of the novel, but that didn&#8217;t happen. So most of my complaints come from the differences between the two.When making a film adaption for a novel it&#8217;s natural to make changes so it&#8217;s a more enjoyable cinematic experience, but some things they changed, or left out completely, were kind of odd. For example they left out the lunch that Charlie (Logan Lerman) had with Bill (Paul Rudd) which was, in my opinion, a very important scene in the book. It really showed the relationship between the two and explained why Bill acted the way he did towards Charlie. They kind of gave a half-assed version of this on the last day of school, but it wasn&#8217;t the same. The other major scene that got left out was the whole ordeal with Charlie&#8217;s sister Candace (Nina Dobrev). Once again this was one of those sections that really helped build the relationship between Charlie and another character, but it was completely ignored. Which is really sad because Charlie&#8217;s family as a whole kind of felt like an afterthought in this film.The only major gripe in terms of scenes being altered was the scene before Sam (Emma Watson) left for college. It felt really watered down in comparison to the novel. It was kind of the climaxing point in the book, but here it just seemed like another scene. There were other scenes too. Like when Charlie was shoveling snow at the party, Sam came to talk to him instead of Mark. How Charlie approached Sam and Patrick at the football game. The confrontation between Patrick and Brad in the &#8220;nutrition center.&#8221; It&#8217;s actually surprising how many changes were made.With all that aside the movie was, as I said before, fantastic. The cast was excellent, even though I pictured some of the characters differently. I didn&#8217;t expect Mary Elizabeth (Mae Whitman) to look like so much of a punker chick, and I pictured Bill as someone who was a little overweight, wore glasses, and was bald on the top of his head, but had hair on the sides. Either way, both Paul Rudd and Mae Whitman did a fantastic job. The person who played Bob (Adam Hagenbuch) was perfect and I almost died when I saw his face after Charlie gave him the bubbles. It was such a simple, kind of insignificant, part of the story, but it was just perfect.Logan Lerman and Emma Watson were fantastic as well and they had great chemistry in their scenes together. At first I was kind of on the fence with Erza Miller, the guy who plays Patrick. There were some scenes where I felt he was amazing, but then there were others where I felt they went over the top with the whole homosexual thing. Especially when you take into consideration that Patrick is supposed to be the dominant one in his relationship. The only character I felt was poorly cast would be Charlie&#8217;s brother Chris (Zane Holtz). He&#8217;s supposed to be a freshman in college, but he looks old enough to have a six year old son. They didn&#8217;t give him a lot of screen time, but every time I saw him it felt weird.The DVD contains some bonus footage as well as the main movie. You have some deleted scenes and an altered version of the beginning. Most of the scenes, although not in the book, were nice and would have definitely been a nice contribution to the main film. Most of it was family related material that showed the reserved yet lovable bond between Charlie and his family. One of the deleted scenes is actually a slightly altered version of the scene with Candace. Now it wasn't perfect, but it was still a beautiful and should have been included. Along with the deleted scenes you have the &#34;Best Day Ever&#34; feature which is basically a clip lasting around five minutes that has Stephen, Logan, and Emma discussing what it was like on set. Then you have three &#34;Dailies&#34; which are three separate clips that Stephen looked at when he felt that they were never going to get a shot right.Overall Score: 8.75/10 - Even though a lot of things got changed from the novel the film was still extremely enjoyable. Part of me feels they had to change a lot so they could keep the PG-13 rating. Which kind of sucks because when I saw it in theaters there was only like ten other people in the theater with my sister and I. If you're a fan of the book I would definitely recommend watching it. My only advice would be to go in with an open mind and not expect a perfect book-to-film recreation. To those who haven't read the book well what are you waiting for? Do yourself a favor a read the book first then watch the movie. You'll appreciate it more that way.",4,8.75/10 - Great,1362009600,"02 28, 2013",2013,5105,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.It', '8217', 's', 'hard', 'find', 'word',

Voiceover: troubled-teen Charlie (Logan Lerman) is writing a letter to `Dear Friend' about his nervousness entering public high school the following day. He'll be a freshman, & has no friends, due to a recent hospitalization forced by a mental breakdown. Following scene, we see a lonely Charlie navigating the halls of his high school, trying to avoid upper-classmen's pranks. He does have a short meeting with a sympathetic English teacher (Paul Rudd), who tells him `you make a new friend every day'. Charlie replies `honestly sir, if the only friend I make today is my English teacher, that's a little depressing.'But there is a bright spot: Charlie sees a senior, Patrick (Ezra Miller) clowning in his Woodshop class. When the teacher enters & calls Patrick `Patsy', Patrick answers `My name is Patrick. Call me that or nothing.' Soon, everyone is calling him `Nothing'.At the Homecoming Football game, Charlie enters the stands alone, but sees Patrick in the bleachers, also alone. He moves up to speak with him, & they're soon joined by Sam (Emma Watson). Sam is Patrick's step-sister, only Charlie doesn't realize that initially; he thinks they're a couple.Patrick & Sam are both seniors, but allow Charlie to become part of their circle of friends. Patrick also happens to be an out-&-proud gay, who's dating the very-closeted quarterback of the football team.Some incidents in the film include driving through a tunnel to `Heroes' on the radio (inexplicably, NONE of the 3 friends recognize the song), & participation in the town showing of `The Rocky Horror Picture Show'. Patrick's Dr Frank N Furter is 1 of the prettiest since Tim Curry's!All performances are really good; Ms Watson handles an American accent admirably. However, Ezra Miller as Patrick is just ELECTRIC. Every scene that includes him just sparkles.The main question I left with (other than the `Heroes' one) is why do a bunch of seniors immediately welcome a freshman into their group?

Often, when that happens with a movie based upon a book, you have the option of reading the book to get the rest of the story. I was a little hesitant to do so with this one since this movie was actually directed by the original author. How different could it be. More than I could have imagined apparently. What often sets the way a book is told from a movie is the inner monologue. With the book being told with a series of letters from Charlie, it is essentially all inner monologue, it is his point of view on everything. You see him writing one of these letters in the opening of the film, but no further details is ever revealed in the movie at all about that. Granted it's the same story for the most part, with a few variations in details, it is just told from a different perspective. We are seeing it as it happens, not as Charlie reports and reacts to it.

You root for him and are riding on his emotions, but you are also trying to understand who exactly he is.Without spoiling anything, the basis goes like this: Charlie's best friend shot himself the summer before Charlie goes to high school. As a result, he enters high school as a loner and outcast, and has to try to get through the year with as little resistance as he can. Luckily he starts to make friends and you are brought into their lives with Charlie.Many moral issues surface along the way. Not directly, but they are happening.

Daneker,"[1, 1]","It's a rare moment, when a film adaptation of a novel rises to a level above the source material, maybe Stephen Chbosky benefited from reviewing his own prose and realizing some of it's flaws.Charlie is a self-alienating high-school freshman who's jock brother is going to Penn State and his older sister has hit that point where she doesn't want younger siblings in her fledgling adult-ish life (though she is still in high school as well). The source novel is epistolary, and the letters all addressed to an anonymous ""friend"" but none of the referenced events involving said ""friend"" occur in the narrative, I personally took away from it that ""friend"" is a journal and he is talking to himself about himself but who knows but the author.The issue with ""book"" Charlie is that he lives in 1950 while the story takes place in the late 80's. Charlie is so naive and innocent in the book there's no way he's a teenager in modern times. On issue I had reading the book was that it felt in so many ways like it took place sixty years ago.The movie dispenses with most of Charlies eager innocence and instead gives us a lonely, alienated Charlie that doesn't feel he fits in with anyone until he meets a senior girl and her gay half brother who introduce him to the world.The movie is swift and appealing, the actors all do an excellent job (check out the voice of Avatar: The Last Airbender's Katara as charlies short-lived girlfriend) and it properly makes you feel and laugh and want to spend time just watching these kids, and that says a lot for the film.I don't believe Emma Watson, both beautiful and talented looses her British accent, but instead falls into a sort of American Haught wich can be a little distracting. There's also a slight deviation in a late-story ""sex"" scene from the book which I prefer, again, the way it's handled in the film.It's good for an author to get to improver their work rather than see it slandered on the screen.

Moore,"[1, 1]","Stephen Chbosky's ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"" based on his own novel, is as good as moviemaking about and for young adults ever gets. There's little need for me to go into detail about the plot, which concerns the freshman year of Charlie (Logan Lerman), a shy, emotionally fragile teenager drawn into the Bohemian high-school circle led by step-siblings Sam (Emma Watson) and Patrick (Ezra Miller). Most of the people who will go see this movie already know and love the story.""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" has been compared with the movies of John Hughes, but for me its emotions cut deeper than in anything Hughes ever did. The problems of these teens--particularly those of Charlie and Patrick--seem more real and more urgent than those faced by Hughes' characters. A large part of the film's emotional impact comes from the acting, particularly that of the three leads. Lerman, Watson and Miller have featured prominently in movies before (Watson, let's face it, will always be Hermione for millions of moviegoers), and have always been superb.

1610291,AR8HCCLIFWQHP,B00AFEY354,Mirror_Matter,"[20, 52]","The decision is in.  The public is determined to rave about this movie.  Perhaps because it offers the appealing idea that everyone who went through high school outside of the ""cool kid"" group was actually super special in their own way and it was the world's fault, or perhaps a molesting aunt's fault, that they were having difficulty in some way.  It does not seem to matter that these self-described ""misfit toys"" actually had a veritable mansion with a six-car garage with which to have these great parties.  It does not matter that these misfits were hailed as the star cast of Rocky Horror Picture Shows live theatrical sing-a-along, performed at a Broadway level of expertise to a packed house that loved them.  Yes, these are the poor down-and-out kids of the time.  Did I mention that they are all attractive as well as talented?  These poor, poor kids, having such a hard time out of life.  But the let-us-Americans-feel-sorry-for-ourselves theme of the movie is the only realistic thing about it.  Emma Watson, playing a wizened senior dating college men, looks the same age as the young freshman.  So the dialogue of an experienced woman (""I want to make sure that the first person you kiss is someone who loves you"") just doesn't feel right.  Have the filmmakers seen what a freshman looks like and the difference between freshman and seniors?  The film is this unrealistic throughout the movie.  Poor Emma, a beautiful young girl with the grades to go to Penn State, an Ivy League school, has self-esteem issues.  Can I get into Penn State.  Well, obviously you have the grades to go to college.  So get over whether you are making it to the ivy league.  Their leader, again wealthy and talented, must endure the tragedy of being in love with the gay quarterback (the gay quarterback is actually a cliche in such ""quirky"" movies).  And both tragedies are explained (twice just so you can tell your friends about the incredibly deep theme of the movie) by: ""We only accept the love we think we deserve.""  Such deep wisdom is appropriate for the Jerry Springer show, but couldn't we have just a little bit more here.  Well, perhaps we only get the movies we think we deserve.  In which case, we apparently don't think we deserve much.  But I don't think that I deserved this painful two hours and if you have any self-esteem, perhaps you will save yourself such pain.",1,We Only Accept The Movies We Think We Deserve,1365292800,"04 7, 2013",2013,2380,"['decision', 'public', 'determined', 'rave', 'movie', 'Perhaps', 'appealing', 'idea', 'everyone', 'who', 'went', 'high', 'school', 'cool', 'kid', 'group', 'was', 'actually', 'super', 'special', 'own', 'way', 'was', 'world', 'fault', 'perhaps', 'molesting', 'aunt', 'fault', 'were', 'having', 'difficulty', 'way', 'not', 'seem', 'matter', 'self-described', 'misfit', 'toys', 'actually', 'had', 'veritable', 'mansion', 'six-car', 'garage', 'have', 'great', 'parties', 'not', 'matter', 'misfits', 'were', 'hailed', 'star', 'cast', 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'Picture', 'Shows', 'live', 'theatrical', 'sing-a-along', 'performed', 'Broadway', 'level', 'expertise', 'packed', 'house', 'loved', 'Yes', 'are', 'poor', 'down-and-out', 'kids', 'time', 'Did', 'mention', 'are', 'attractive', 'as', 'well', 'talented', 'poor', 'poor', 'kids', 'having', 'such', 'hard', 'time', 'life', 'let-us-Americans-feel-sorry-for-ourselves', 'theme', 'movie', 'only', 'realistic', 'thing', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'playing', 'wizened', 'senior', 'dating', 'college', 'men', 'same', 'age', 'young', 'freshman', 'dialogue', 'experienced', 'woman', 'want', 'make', 'sure', 'first', 'person', 'kiss', 'someone', 'who', 'just', ""n't"", 'feel', 'right', 'Have', 'filmmakers', 'seen', 'what', 'freshman', 'difference', 'freshman', 'seniors', 'film', 'unrealistic', 'movie', 'Poor', 'Emma', 'beautiful', 'young', 'girl', 'grades', 'go', 'Penn', 'State', 'Ivy', 'League', 'school', 'self-esteem', 'issues', 'Can', 'get', 'Penn', 'State', 'Well', 'obviously', 'have', 'grades', 'go', 'college', 'So', 'get', 'are', 'making', 'ivy', 'league', 'leader', 'again', 'wealthy', 'talented', 'must', 'endure', 'tragedy', 'being', 'love', 'gay', 'quarterback', 'gay', 'quarterback', 'actually', 'cliche', 'such', 'quirky', 'movies', 'tragedies', 'are', 'explained', 'twice', 'just', 'can', 'tell', 'friends', 'incredibly', 'deep', 'theme', 'movie', 'only', 'accept', 'love', 'think', 'deserve', 'Such', 'deep', 'wisdom', 'appropriate', 'Jerry', 'Springer', 'show', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'here', 'Well', 'perhaps', 'only', 'get', 'movies', 'think', 'deserve', 'case', 'apparently', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'deserve', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'deserved', 'painful', 'two', 'hours', 'have', 'self-esteem', 'perhaps', 'will', 'save', 'such', 'pain']",N/A

1610294,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00AFEY354,M. Oleson,"[10, 14]","I'm not quite sure the film answers the implied question the title suggests, but it certainly does a great job of delivering an interesting take on growing up. Charlie (Logan Lerman) is a high school freshman re-entering the system after a mysterious past. Mild mannered and avoiding confrontation, he has no friends but for a sympathetic English teacher (Paul Rudd). Finally he meets friendly seniors, a gay kid named Patrick (excellent Ezra Miller) and his step-sister Sam (Emma Watson, negating any question of could she succeed after ""Harry Potter"").Both are shunned by the cool kids but provide their own entertainment and have an extended circle of ""hippie-type"" friends. Their music and literature is different and Charlie, an aspiring writer, soaks it all in. He falls hard for Sam, but like Charlie, she has a past and a reputation that still haunts her. Patrick has a boyfriend on the football team that will cause the expected problems when it is discovered.Director/writer Stephen Chbosky hits all the right notes as the trio and classmates grind their way through the school year. Along the way, discoveries are made, feelings are hurt and love is found. And of course, secrets come out. None of this is necessarily new of course. I suspect anyone with a high school memory will find something familiar. Perhaps that is why the movie resonates so strongly. That and nicely paced direction and superlative performances.The Blu ray transfer from Summit Entertainment has an aspect ratio of 1.78:1 vs. the original 1.85:1.  The resolution is the usual 1080p.  It looks fine if a bit uneven.  I was expecting the movie to be a bit sharper given the 35mm original film.  In particular some of the shots in low light seem affected.  Overall, it isn't terribly distracting.  The lossless audio comes in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  The film is dialog driven so we can forgive the limited use of the surrounds.  Overall the sound is very stable and without issue.  Extras include a couple commentary tracks.  One with the director/writer.  Another with the director and cast members.

1610322,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00AFEY354,Paul Allaer,"[1, 1]","""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" (2012 release; 102 min.) brings the bittersweet tale of Charlie (played by Logan Lerman), an incoming freshman at high school, trying to rebound from ""time spent in the hospital"" (which is explained later in the movie). He feels like a fish out of water and just trying to keep his head down. Then, strangely and almost miraculously, he finds friendship with several HS seniors who take him under their wings. Life gets better from there, and eventually he hooks up with one of these HS girls, Mary Elizabeth (played by Mae Whitman), even though his true love is Sam (played by Emmat Watson). I won't spoil more of the plot, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: (1) it takes a leap of faith to understand and accept that HS seniors decide to befriend a HS freshman, for no apparent reason. Do you recall this happening in your life? (2) The early part of the movie is riddled with cliches (the secret gay HS football QB--gasp!, for one). (3) All of the 'in-crowd' are music-nerds to no end (""My favorite band is The Smiths""; ""Nick Drake? nice!"") yet none of them recognize the David Bowie monster-hit ""Heroes"" in a pivotal early scene, c'mon! (4) Emma ""Harry Potter"" Watson, whom I had never seen before as I have not seen the Harry Potter movies, brings a fantastic performance that just oozes charm all the way. (Paul Rudd also brings an very nice understated preformance in a supporting role as the English teacher.)If some of my comments sound too critical, let me tell you that the last 45 min. of the movie just blew me away in the best of ways. The movie then turns much more introvertal, and it simply resonated with me. At one point towards the end Charlie comments about what is hitting him right then and there, and how ""someday we'll be a mom or dad"" and to enjoy the moment got what it is. So true! I recognized myself in that, being a dad now of grown-up kids. A final note: Stephen Chbosky, who wrote the 1999 book, does a great job writing and directing (his debut) this movie.

This is a compelling story, alive with characters that are vibrant and real - at a time in life which we feel will go on forever butwe are painfully unaware of just how fleeting youth is.Yet with all it's angst and insecurity the healing value of friendship and truly connecting with others are medicine for the soul.In the case of ""Wallflower"" it's more than a glimpse into the past of the characters we come so quickly to both admire and love - it compels us to look back and remember our own. In it's finest moments we're reminded how much our own lives are dependent upon small moments of time that although slip through our fingers regardless of how hard we try and hang on that define who are.The performances are stellar all around. With  Logan Lerman as the lead Charlie a sad and unsure of himself fifteen year old facing high school his quiet performance is both compelling and beautiful in most every sense of the word.  In fact there's not a poor or one dimensional performance to be found. The role of Patrick played by Ezra Miller is equally exceptional as is Emma Watson's portrayal of Sam - Patrick's step sister and Charlie's first and great love.The appeal of the script must have been strong enough to entice far more seasoned and well known actors. With Dylan McDermott as Charlie's father, Paul Rud as Charlie's English teacher, mentor and  friend and a cameo by the extraordinary Joan Cusak. Plus an unbelievable surprise with legendary make up artist Tom Savini as the noob shop teacher - if I wasn't a die hard fan of Savini's work I would never have recognized him.Director Stephen Chbosky proves himself a born story teller the natural flow and rhythm of the film, combined with a few cliches' but their minimal and pale in comparison to the heart of ""Wallflower"" which is huge, endearing and great.

Some of it feels a little too on the Juno side, constantly name-dropping ""cool"" bands as an initial means to bring the characters together. While this plot device gets old fast, it does feel authentic albeit tiring by the end. We get it, you make each other mix tapes.What the film does very well is represent the frustrations of ourselves, our loved ones, and the choices we make. The characters fight, experiment with drugs, and fall in love with the wrong people. There is a powerful quote that, when it comes to romance, ""we accept what we think we deserve.""Flashes like this are when the movie works at its best; at its core, it is really a tragic story, and these people don't have any meaning in their lives beyond that which they create for themselves. We see these people as fully developed, flawed human beings, whose past actions shape their behavior in the present.A disturbing revelation at the end explains the protagonist (excellently played by newcomer Logan Lerman) and the weight he has carried for years. Even before his past is explained, his acting choices make it clear that there is something terribly wrong. We also get superb and well-rounded performances from Emma Watson (despite her so-so American accent) and Ezra Miller as the two mentor figures who take Lerman's character in.The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a powerful existentialist look at the adolescent experience.

I believe any movie should stand on its own and not be compared to the original book (which I have not read).This is a good movie about friendship -- extraordinary young actors!  Being a friend means accepting the whole person; that was the good message in the show.  Some of the best laughs and warmest feelings come from this group of 'wallflowers' or misfits fitting in with each other.But, some of the other topics made this too much for my early teen to take.  Me, too.  Couldn't anyone in the show not have tragedy in their lives current or past?  So glad the friends were there for the main character at the end, the uplift was good. But overall, too sad.I would only recommend this for very mature early teens or mid-teens. Be prepared for very troubled, deep, and dark themes, but the friendship made and saved this movie.  It's not a happy movie.SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERSSome of the other subjects were hard to take, too many in fact.  My daughter missed some of the references to Sam's promiscuous past, an adult in her past who acted inappropriately to her, the deleted scenes about the sister's preganacy situation missed out on seeing Charlie as someone who was there for his loved ones but still more sad, a friend with possible bulimia, a teen who can't face being gay and his father who beats the son for being gay, lots of drinking and some drug use, the aunt molesting the main character was not revealed until toward the end of the movie was just too much to take by then as you are weighted down by all the sadness surrounding and happening to Charlie.

That film felt more epic than the traditional Hughes film, in part due to Crowe's drawing from his experiences with Rolling Stone. Author/Director Stephen Chobsky also draws from experience to create Perks, however his film has the more intimate feel of a Hughes movie (The Breakfast Club), and that makes it great.The Perks of Being a Wallflower is set in or around Pittsburgh, PA in the early 1990s. Charlie (Logan Lerman) is the aforementioned wallflower; a high school freshman with light heart, but a heavy soul since his best friend recently committed suicide. He finds fitting in and making friends a challenge and instead chooses to lose himself in the novels of equally awkward, soul-searching literary protagonists supplied by his English teacher, Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd). Charlie's awakening comes as a result of being accepted by a group of like-minded upper-classmen. It is here that Charlie's coming of age journey into adolescence finds its stride.The Perks of Being a Wallflower seems to unfold effortlessly. We learn more about Charlie as he learns more about himself. This surrealist approach to self-discovery allows the viewer to be both surprised by and understanding of Charlie's decisions and actions. His closest friends are Sam (Emma Watson) and Sam's step-brother, Patrick (Ezra Miller), and they shape the heart of this film. Sam's confidence, charm, and beauty complement her romantic and impulsive attitude towards life, which spellbinds and captivates the sullen but passionate Charlie. Ezra Miller as Patrick deserves special notice as he steals every scene he's in. This character is miles from his ultra-disturbing performance as Kevin in We Need to Talk About Kevin, but is even more impressive. Patrick's story reveals him to be somewhat of a foil to Charlie as both have similar struggles of adolescence and deal with them very differently. The supporting characters all have their moments as well, allowing secondary characters to be purposeful and not artificial. The film's best line is given to Charlie's dad, played Dylan McDermott, in an amusing exchange about borrowing money for a date.The success of Perks also lies in Chobsky's handling of his own source material's tone. He never lets us, or Charlie, get too comfortable, hinting that something more sinister is lying beneath the surface, yet he never allows the film's youthful spirit to suffer. This balance illustrates the volatility of teenage years with that same touch John Hughes had. The film also allows music to play a major part in the characters' lives, which was a classic Hughes trademark.The Perks of Being a Wallflower is very successful at what it sets out to be. Many recent films of this genre either feel too self-important and preachy or they go the other way and seem shallow. This film strikes out a balance and while not treading new ground, deservedly treads proudly.

I thought it would be sweet or quirky, and it was all that in the beginning, but as the movie progressed the plot got deeper and darker and downright unsettling.  The movie had me up half the night worrying about child molesters, pedophiles, and other such human monsters.Don't get me wrong I thought the acting and directing were great; it was just the subject matter that threw me.  I was expecting The Breakfast Club and I got Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.*** Spoiler Alert - Ending is Revealed ***At the start of the movie you think the main character's depression is caused by his best friend's suicide.  As the plot thickens you are lead to believe that Charlie's depression is the result of his Aunt's death on Christmas Eve.  Then you find out that both the Aunt and the lead female character were molested as children.  At the end it is revealed that the Aunt (who was abused as a child) was abusing the 6 year old Charlie.  (Just guessing about his age.)  Charlie spirals down further into depression, attempted suicide and is finally placed in a mental hospital.  He is released eventually and returns to life.  The movie ends on a high note with Charlie back with his supportive and loving friends.Almost every character in the movie had deep, dark emotional and physical scaring, but the movie did have some funny moments.  The Rocky Horror Picture Show brought back a lot of fond memories as did the soundtrack.  Loved hearing ""Come On Eileen"".  Seeing all the old technology: cassette tapes, vinyl records, and clunker cordless phones was also a kick.So, like most movies, it had it good points and its bad points.

What if you'd just been released from the hospital? Do you really think you could rebound from that?Charlie (played by Logan Lerman), is a quiet, introspective teenager who has recently suffered a setback, the full nature of which we're not informed of, and is about to start his freshman year of high school. The only friend he makes on his first day is his English teacher, Bill Anderson (played by Paul Rudd). Rather than worry his parents, (played by Dylan McDermott and Kate Walsh) Charlie gives the typical, one-syllable description of his first day of high school. Time passes and Charlie becomes friends with step-siblings Sam and Patrick. Sam (played by former Harry Potter actress Emma Watson) is an outgoing senior dating a college guy and her step-brother Patrick (played by Ezra Miller) is a flamboyant underachiever with a great sense of humor. They attend a football game together and follow that with a visit to a diner before driving Charlie home. The next function they attend as a group is a party where Charlie, unknowingly, ingests a pot brownie. It is during this moment of drug-fueled confidence that Charlie reveals to Sam the fact that he lost a friend to suicide one year ago. After quietly relaying that fact to Patrick, he and Sam both decide then and there that Charlie should become a full-fledged member of their group. Moments later, Charlie bears witness to a romantic encounter between Patrick and his closeted boyfriend, star football player Brad (played by Johnny Simmons). They leave the party, go for a drive, and hear a song that inspires Sam to stand in the bed of the pickup truck and stretch out her arms as they drive through a tunnel. This is when Charlie first develops romantic feelings for Sam which she is completely unaware of.There's a lot to like about this film. Miller and Watson's characters are both very endearing and their decision to adopt fellow outcast Charlie is a moment that brings hope for the character and life in general. There are elements I believe the film could do without. Examples include the one-sided relationship between two of the characters and the references to The Rocky Horror Picture Show, which never resonated with me the way it seems to with others.

Even though there are a few extremes that comes with each character, their nature and their bonds of friendship are some of the most incredible. As the story unfolds there are parts that can make you laugh and cry and sometimes conjure up memories of your time in school with your friends because chances are something in this film may have happened to you. Emma Watson has to be spoken about just because it is her first major role since Harry Potter and she did an incredible job even though at some points her inner British came out. Logan Lehrman is amazing and of course Ezra Miller steals the show. Why he got no nomination at the Oscars is beyond me. While I have never read this novel I am sure most can say how well in compares to the book, epseically since the author himself wrote the script and directed the film.I love this movie and I encourage everyone to see it, even if you don't like movies like these it is guaranteed to strike a chord with you.",5,A gem,1370044800,"06 1, 2013",2013,1180,"['Perks', 'Being', 'A', 'Wallflower', 'best', 'film', 'saw', '2012', 'one', 'greatest', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'emotions', 'cast', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'relateable', 'film', 'Even', 'are', 'few', 'extremes', 'character', 'nature', 'bonds', 'friendship', 'are', 'most', 'incredible', 'story', 'are', 'parts', 'can', 'make', 'laugh', 'cry', 'sometimes', 'conjure', 'up', 'memories', 'time', 'school', 'friends', 'chances', 'are', 'something', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'happened', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'be', 'spoken', 'about', 'just', 'first', 'major', 'role', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'did', 'incredible', 'job', 'even', 'points', 'inner', 'British', 'came', 'out', 'Logan', 'Lehrman', 'amazing', 'course', 'Ezra', 'Miller', 'show', 'Why', 'got', 'nomination', 'Oscars', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'novel', 'am', 'sure', 'most', 'can', 'say', 'how', 'well', 'compares', 'book', 'epseically', 'author', 'wrote', 'script', 'directed', 'film.I', 'love', 'movie', 'encourage', 'everyone', 'see', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movies', 'guaranteed', 'strike', 'chord']",N/A

1610401,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B00AFEY354,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[11, 11]","Every now and then, you come across a film where everything was done just right. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of those films.  Directed by Stephen Chbosky, who wrote the screenplay as well as the popular young-adult novel of the same name from which it was adapted, The Perks of Being a Wallflower seems to hit every note just right, capturing all of the tumult and the extreme highs and lows of adolescence as experienced by a group of friends in high school in Pittsburgh back in the 1980's.The film begins with 14-year-old Charlie (Logan Lerman) writing a letter to an anonymous ""Dear Friend"" about his nervousness about starting his first year in high school.  He writes because he doesn't feel he can talk to his parents or his siblings about his anxieties, nor does he seem to have any real friends he can confide in, for reasons that are initially only hinted at in the internal narrative of his letters.Charlie's anxieties prove to be well-founded as he finds himself isolated in his first few days at school, dodging upperclass jocks looking to harass new freshmen, torn between just wanting to be left alone and yet not wanting to feel alone.  The only friend he makes his first day turns out to be his English teacher, Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd), who notices Charlie writing down correct answers to questions he asks of the class but not holding up his hand to be called on.  Sensing Charlie's reluctance to be noticed, Anderson reaches out to him, ""You know they say if you make one friend on your first day you'll do good.""  To which Charlie glumly responds ""If my English teacher is the only friend I make today, that'll be sorta depressing.""In spite of his tendency to withdraw from everyone, Charlie finds himself unexpectedly drawn into the orbit of an ultra-extroverted and over-the-top flamboyant senior named Patrick (Ezra Miller), who happens to be the only senior in his freshman shop class as well as a major source of annoyance to the shop teacher, Mr. Callahan (Tom Savini - yes, for those who recognize the name, it's that Tom Savini).  At the school's first football game, Charlie spots Patrick up in the bleachers and ventures up, hoping Patrick will invite him to sit with him, which Patrick cheerfully does.  They are soon joined by another senior, a quirky but friendly girl named Sam (Emma Watson), to whom Patrick introduces Charlie and with whom Charlie is immediately encrushed.  After the game, Patrick and Sam invite Charlie along to grab something to eat.  The two seem so close to each other that Charlie mistakes them for being boyfriend and girlfriend.  They laughingly correct him and tell him that they're actually step-siblings who found that they just get along really well-together, always liking the same music and always having each other's backs.Gradually, Charlie is befriended by Patrick and Sam.  At the homecoming dance, to which Charlie goes alone, he ends up dancing with Patrick and Sam, who then drag Charlie along with them to a party where he meets the rest of their circle:  Bob (Adam Hagenbuch), an amiable stoner; Mary Elizabeth (Mae Whitman), who's bossy and opinionated; and Alice (Erin Wilhelmi), a proto-goth who's into film.  At the party, Charlie unknowingly has his first hash-brownie, which causes him to loosen up to the point of sharing his observations on what he thinks of high school so far, which both amuses and impresses the others.  He also later divulges privately to Sam that he hasn't been close to anyone since his best friend committed suicide the year before. Learning this, Patrick and Sam decide on the spot to bring Charlie into their circle of friends, with Patrick making it official by quipping ""Welcome to the island of misfit toys.""As Charlie gets to know Patrick and Sam and their circle, he leans that all of them have their own set of individual issues they have to cope with.  Patrick is fairly openly gay, but his boyfriend Brad (Johnny Simmons), one of the school's star football players, is very much in the closet and so they have to pretend to not really know each other in school.  Sam, whom Charlie only sees as beautiful, smart and talented, has low self-esteem and always settles for guys, like her current boyfriend Craig (Reese Thompson), who always treat her badly.  A problem shared by Charlie's sister, Candace (Nina Dobrev), whom Charlie sees being abused by her boyfriend.  At one point, when Sam asks Charlie ""Why do I and everyone I love pick people who treat us like we're nothing?"" he repeats what his English teacher told him when he asked him the same question:  ""We accept the love we think we deserve.""  But when Charlie says it to Sam, he is finally beginning to understand what it means.Chbosky does a fine job of touching on moments that almost everyone can relate to from their own high school experience.  The intensity - and fragility - of adolescent relationships.  The way you can sometimes find yourself in a relationship with someone you don't want to be involved with but don't know how to get out of, even as the person you really want to be with is in a relationship with someone else.  And how formative moments can suddenly come in the most unexpected circumstances.  Like when Patrick and Sam are driving Charlie home after the party and Sam, hearing a song on the radio that she immediately likes, demands that Patrick take the tunnel, where she cranks up the volume and then stands up in the back of the pickup and sways like she's dancing to the music as the tunnel lights flash by overhead.  The image is simple and yet entrancing, and we, with Charlie, find ourselves falling in love with her.Other moments are also well captured.  Like when Charlie unexpectedly gets drafted to be the substitute Rocky in the group's live-cast act at the midnight showing of The Rocky Horror Picture Show and suddenly finds himself nearly naked in gold lame hot pants in a theater full of people, doing the ""Toucha-Toucha-Touch Me!"" number with Sam's bodiced-and-boaed Janet.  Another moment occurs at a party where Charlie his friends are playing truth-or-dare, when Charlie takes a dare and in an unwitting but truly honest moment commits an enormous faux pas, leaving him suddenly shunned by the entire group just as he was beginning to feel like he wasn't alone.  And yet another moment reunites Charlie with the group when he comes to Patrick's rescue during a fight in the cafeteria with a ferocity that takes everyone aback - a moment that for all its heroic nature also hints at Charlie's deeper problems. Problems that ultimately come to a crisis point when graduation comes and Charlie has to watch as his senior friends leave and he finds himself alone once again.  It is to Chbosky's enormous credit that he avoids the usual Hollywood teen-movie approach and treats these situations much as they really are - complicated, with no easy answers, and with wisdom often coming painfully and with a cost.The young cast are all excellent in their roles, with standout performances by Lerman, Miller and Watson.  Logan Lerman's Charlie is a complex mix, perceptive and yet nave, a loner who finds loneliness unbearable, a friend who feels his friends deserve better than they get but cannot bring himself to feel that he does too.  He can rise fiercely to the occasion when his friends are threatened but is as fragile as glass when the secrets he carries buried deep inside threaten to overwhelm him.  Ezra Miller's Patrick is charmingly rendered, a character who uses his flamboyance to mask his frustrations and sometimes despair at the unfairness of life, only letting a very few, like Sam and eventually Charlie, inside his protective front.  And Emma Watson's Sam is a bravura turn as a girl who comes to life among her friends but whose self-esteem withers when it comes to believing she has anything like a future waiting for her or that she can do better in her choices of boyfriends.  All three are acting veterans - Lerman (Percy Jackson & the Olympians), Miller (We Need to Talk about Kevin), and Watson (the Harry Potter films) - but I think The Perks of Being a Wallflower will be a break-out film for all of them. Particularly for Emma Watson, who proves once and for all that she can be a lot more than just Hermione Granger.But if the actors are extraordinary in their performances, credit must also be given to the heartfelt dialogue Chbosky's novel and screenplay provides them to work with.  All are given wonderfully individual voices, but Charlie, as the would-be writer and ever observant `wallflower' among them, is the one ultimately speaks for all of them with an achingly earnest lyrical poetry, as he does at the end when once again he's with Patrick and Sam, driving through the tunnel and listening to the song they'd heard earlier, except that it is now Charlie who is standing in the back and swaying with the lights passing overhead:""I know these will all be stories someday. And our pictures will become old photographs. We'll all become somebody's mom or dad. But right now these moments are not stories. This is happening, I am here and I am looking at her. And she is so beautiful. I can see it. This one moment when you know you're not a sad story. You are alive, and you stand up and see the lights on the buildings and everything that makes you wonder. And you're listening to that song and that drive with the people you love most in this world. And in this moment I swear, we are infinite.""Highly, highly recommended.",5,"""And in this moment I swear, we are infinite.""",1350864000,"10 22, 2012",2012,9498,"['now', 'then', 'come', 'film',

The actors were perfect in their roles- Logan Lerman was stunning as Charlie, I don't think anyone could have portrayed him better. Ezra Miller also was perfect as Patrick, he played the part so well and put so much emotion into it.Logan Lerman made Charlie come alive. He really became Charlie for the movie, and showed his characters nerves, sadness, and other emotions so well. He made Charlie seem even more relatable in the film than he was in the book.Several parts of the film were different from the book. For example, Charlie seemed to have a better relationship with his sister, and his siblings had names, which they didn't in the book. The moments right before Charlie goes to the hospital were also different from the book, but I think they were done well.For me one of the saddest parts of the film was the way Patrick and Brad's relationship had to end. Their relationship in the movie stayed very true to the book, but it was difficult to see how sad their breakup made Patrick. Again, Ezra Miller was perfect in that role.I would give this movie more than five stars if I could! It really was that good. I will be watching it again soon. I hope that many people will watch or have already seen this film, because it is an excellent story with wonderful acting and teaches important lessons.",5,The Perks of Being a Wallflower -may contain spoilers,1392422400,"02 15, 2014",2014,1390,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'actors', 'were', 'perfect', 'roles-', 'Logan', 'Lerman', 'was', 'stunning', 'Charlie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'could', 'have', 'portrayed', 'better', 'Ezra', 'Miller', 'also', 'was', 'perfect', 'Patrick', 'played', 'part', 'so', 'well', 'put', 'so', 'much', 'emotion', 'it.Logan', 'Lerman', 'made', 'Charlie', 'come', 'alive', 'really', 'became', 'Charlie', 'movie', 'showed', 'characters', 'nerves', 'sadness', 'other', 'emotions', 'so', 'well', 'made', 'Charlie', 'seem', 'even', 'more', 'relatable', 'film', 'was', 'book.Several', 'parts', 'film', 'were', 'different', 'book', 'example', 'Charlie', 'seemed', 'have', 'better', 'relationship', 'sister', 'siblings', 'had', 'names', 'did', ""n't"", 'book', 'moments', 'right', 'Charlie', 'hospital', 'were', 'also', 'different', 'book', 'think', 'were', 'done', 'one', 'saddest', 'parts', 'film', 'was', 'way', 'Patrick', 'Brad', 'relationship', 'had', 'end', 'relationship', 'movie', 'stayed', 'very', 'true', 'book', 'was', 'difficult', 'see', 'how', 'sad', 'breakup', 'made', 'Patrick', 'Again', 'Ezra', 'Miller', 'was', 'perfect', 'role.I', 'would', 'give', 'movie', 'more', 'five', 'stars', 'could', 'really', 'was', 'good', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'again', 'soon', 'hope', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'watch', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'film', 'excellent', 'story', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'teaches', 'important', 'lessons']",N/A
1610406,AP3B615GM191G,B00AFEY354,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 3]","I hate to see a movie like this.  I really, really do.  ""Perks of Being A Wallflower"" tries oh so hard to make itself emotionally relevant, but ultimately fails in that regard because it has no ""base"" to fall back on.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Charlie (Logan Lerman), a new high school freshman who epitomizes the word ""wallflower"".  Soon upon his arrival into high school, however, Charlie is taken under the wings of Patrick (Ezra Miller) and Sam (Emma Watson), who show him how to live it up and let go of some of his inhibitions.The main trouble with this movie (minor spoilers ahead) is that I feel the storytelling is backwards and thus the narrative never really plays out in any meaningful way.  It's almost like the character development comes at the very end of the movie, when the characters have already been onscreen for a long, long time.  Thus, when the ""big emotional payoff"" actually comes to fruition, it really doesn't because for so long the characters were just kind of floating along without a solid base.This whole experience strikes me as a prime example of ""the book being better than the movie"".  I haven't read the book, but I'd almost bet money that it does a much better job of conveying the adolescent message than this movie does.  This is even despite the fact that I thought the acting was actually pretty good.  That wasn't the problem....the problem was the overall tone and plot devices.Thus, I couldn't get into ""Perks of Being A Wallflower"" whatsoever because I didn't feel for the characters until the very end, and by then it was just too late.  My exact star rating would be more like 1.5, but I bump it up a little because I think there was a sincere effort here to create a good movie.  It just didn't work for me.",2,"It Tries, But Has No Base",1377302400,"08 24, 2013",2013,1786,"['hate', 'see', 'movie', 'really', 'really', 'do', 'Perks', 'Being', 'Wallflower', 'tries', 'oh', 'so', 'hard', 'make', 'emotionally', 'relevant', 'ultimately', 'regard', 'base', 'fall', 'back', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'movie', 'story', 'Charlie', 'Logan', 'Lerman', 'new', 'high', 'school', 'freshman', 'who', 'word', 'wallflower', 'Soon', 'arrival', 'high', 'school', 'however', 'Charlie', 'taken', 'wings', 'Patrick', 'Ezra', 'Miller', 'Sam', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'who', 'show', 'how', 'live', 'up', 'let', 'go', 'inhibitions.The', 'main', 'trouble', 'movie', 'minor', 'spoilers', 'ahead', 'feel', 'storytelling', 'backwards', 'thus', 'narrative', 'never', 'really', 'out', 'meaningful', 'way', 'almost', 'character', 'development', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'when', 'characters', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'onscreen', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'Thus', 'when', 'big', 'emotional', 'payoff', 'actually', 'fruition', 'really', ""n't"", 'because', 'so', 'long', 'characters', 'were', 'just', 'kind', 'floating', 'along', 'solid', 'base.This', 'whole', 'experience', 'strikes', 'prime', 'example', 'book', 'being', 'better', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', ""'d"", 'almost', 'bet', 'money', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'conveying', 'adolescent', 'message', 'movie', 'even', 'fact', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'was', ""n't"", 'problem', '.the', 'problem', 'was', 'overall', 'tone', 'plot', 'devices.Thus', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'Perks', 'Being', 'Wallflower', 'whatsoever', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'characters', 'very', 'end', 'then', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'late', 'exact', 'star', 'rating', 'would', 'be', 'more', '1.5', 'bump', 'up', 'little', 'think', 'was', 'sincere', 'effort', 'here', 'create', 'good', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work']",N/A
