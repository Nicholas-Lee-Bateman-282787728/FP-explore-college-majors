534158,A1ALOIPRR8Q06J,B00003CXRM,"2 cents ""meaningless memes""","[1, 2]","Cable TV classic. Often brings my channel surfing to a halt. Thumbs up to the performers and to those amazing filmmakers, the Coen Brothers. In particular George Clonney. He needs his Dapper Dan promade and when he says, ""We're in a real tight spot"" I care. John Turturro can't suc. Blake Nelson looks and sounds just right for the part. And John Goodman is terrific _as always_. The much ballyhooed about soundtrack is pretty good, but I agree that the 1927 Harry McClintock version of ""Big Rock Candy Mountain"" *by far* is the definite highlight. I felt vindicated when I read influential music/culture critic Greil Marcus say the same. LOVE that song! Marcus says ""Big Rock Candy Mountain"" by Harry should have been on the landmark ""Anthology of American Folk Music"". Btw, since I mention Marcus he hits the nail on the head here as regards the soundtrack: ""it's no surprise the album reached so many people so strongly--if you don't know this music, it's like doors in a mountain opening, and you can't help but want to go inside. It's an old-timey version of The Harder They Come soundtrack, and there's as much to discover in a more-where-this-came-from sense as there was there"". Right.So yeah, as you may notice, it ain't ""Fargo"". But then what is? Well I was just thinking about this movie. I was not that impressed by it when I first saw it. But you know, I can't put my finger on **why**. And that is bothersome. Too high expectations? No. I didn't have many expectations one way or the other. Was it the, to my mind anyhow, - excessive buzz around it. Hmmm. That may have played a part. You just hear too much about somethan and it somehow takes away form the impact. You, without realizing it, end up a little turned off. It's like, ""that's it?"". That's what all the fuss is about?But now I love ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"".

534159,AYQY3RB33F4J6,B00003CXRM,3rdeadly3rd,"[5, 7]","""O Brother Where Art Thou"" is that rare beast, a film which can be enjoyed on a great many levels and constantly yields new treasures each time it is watched.The plot revolves around the escapades of three depression-era prison escapees (led by George Clooney in a command performance as the born-to-lead Ulysses Everett MacGill) as they attempt to track down the proceeds of a robbery.  As with so many quality comedies, however, that is merely the idea which starts the ball rolling. The plot also involves political machinations, love, religion, the Klan and musical interludes - in short, it has everything.Much of the humour is - on the surface - derived from the southern accents of the characters and their ways of dealing with the hardships of the era (with the stew being a good example of this). A secondary source of humour comes from Clooney's attempts at sounding well-educated and his constant observations on what's going on - there's also the requisite catchphrase (in this case ""we're in a tight spot"") which never fails to get a laugh.""O Brother"" also takes some of its cues from slapstick and farce. The climactic scenes as our heroes invade first a Klan rally and then a political banquet clearly give more than a nod to Leslie Nielsen's ""Naked Gun"" series and indeed any other madcap comedy every made. Even this larger-than-life comedy is essentially character driven, which in my opinion makes it slightly a cut above the average.There is also a third level to this film. Throughout the action, various references are made to Homer's Greek epic ""The Odyssey"" - ranging from Cyclopses to Sirens. Certainly the viewing experience is enhanced by reviewing the events of Homer's poem before watching, but this is not essential by anyone's way of thinking.As has been said by a great many reviewers before and no doubt will be again, ""O Brother"" enjoys a strong relationship with its soundtrack. All of the songs and instrumental pieces performed in the film make their way onto the soundtrack in the form in which they appear - with the added fact that ""Po Lazarus"" (the song of the prisoners at the very beginning of the film) is present as a field recording from the 1950s.The music in the film is vital to the plot, as Clooney and his two friends come across a bluesman (Chris Thomas King) who has sold his soul to the devil, a reference to Robert Johnson. As this young man - Tommy Johnson - puts it ""well...I wasn't usin' it"". The foursome then record a version of ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" which becomes a considerable hit. Their appearance - uninvited - at the political banquet on the eve of the gubernatorial election results in the performance both of ""In The Jailhouse Now"" and a fuller-bodied version of ""Constant Sorrow"". Of course, listening to either of these songs on the soundtrack in light of the events surrounding them - especially Clooney's reaction to the striking up of ""Constant Sorrow"" -  on the film becomes a much funnier experience.While not to take anything away from the film itself, there are one or two slight problems in watching it. The first is that some of the scenes don't appear to be adquately miked in the earlier sections of the film - especially the scene where the three escapees are eating dinner at the run-down farmhouse. This has the effect of obscuring some of the very clever dialogue of those sections. The second minor problem is that it does not adequately resolve all the issues raised - such as the identity of the police chief and the exact state of Clooney's marriage. This may, of course, be a deliberately vague thing on the Coen brothers' part, either to set the film up for a sequel (which is unlikely, considering both that there was no sequel to ""The Odyssey"" and that any sequel would almost invariably be not as good as this original) or simply to provoke questions in the minds of the viewers, which it certainly does.Most assuredly, though, this is one of the great films of the 90s and is well worth a viewing by anyone interested in good comedy, entertainment for the intellect or good filmmaking.

534164,A2S166WSCFIFP5,B00003CXRM,"adead_poet@hotmail.com ""adead_poet@hotmail.com""","[6, 7]","What the Coen brothers have created here is a film that is going to last. It quickly made it into my list of top ten movies. It's the Depression-era story of three escaped convicts and their journey to redemption. And along the way they face many trials and tribulations. It's no wonder the story is such a good one, since the film is based on Homer's classic poem, The Odyssey (which the Coen brothers claim to never have read. I don't know that I believe them, but I suppose they could have read the Cliff's Notes).  George Clooney, John Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson do a fabulous job as the leads. And John Goodman and Holly Hunter have wonderful supporting roles. The music in this film takes on the aspect of a character. And while I wouldn't call this a musical, song occurs and affects what is going on--and it occurs in the logical places instead of the characters just breaking into song whenever. In fact, I think the soundtrack made a bigger splash than the film (but give it time, I think that people will begin to realize the importance of this film soon enough). Color and the visual style of the film also takes on the aspects of being its own character. I know that the entire film was put through a digital workshop in order to give it the visual feel the Coen brothers wanted. This movie is destined to be one of the all time greats.Unfortunately the dvd doesn't contain a commentary by the Coens or the stars. It is a shame, because I think a Coen commentary would have helped to round out this dvd perfectly. There is a behind the scenes featurette and a featurette that discusses the post-production digital process, both of which are good. There is a menu option that allows you to compare the storyboard with the completed scene (of the Klan scene and the final scene). And finally there is the ""I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow"" music video that helps to complete the dvd. It's a charming video.This is a film I've already seen a dozen times and will continue to watch as time goes on.",5,a modern classic,1031616000,"09 10, 2002",2002,2008,"['What', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'have', 'created', 'here', 'film', 'going', 'last', 'quickly', 'made', 'list', 'top', 'ten', 'movies', 'Depression-era', 'story', 'three', 'escaped', 'convicts', 'journey', 'redemption', 'way', 'face', 'many', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'wonder', 'story', 'such', 'good', 'one', 'film', 'based', 'Homer', 'classic', 'poem', 'Odyssey', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'claim', 'never', 'have', 'read', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'believe', 'suppose', 'could', 'have', 'read', 'Cliff', 'Notes', 'George', 'Clooney', 'John', 'Turturro', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'do', 'fabulous', 'job', 'leads', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'have', 'wonderful', 'supporting', 'roles', 'music', 'film', 'aspect', 'character', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'musical', 'song', 'occurs', 'affects', 'what', 'going', 'logical', 'places', 'instead', 'characters', 'just', 'breaking', 'song', 'whenever', 'fact', 'think', 'soundtrack', 'made', 'bigger', 'splash', 'film', 'give', 'time', 'think', 'people', 'will', 'begin', 'realize', 'importance', 'film', 'soon', 'enough', 'Color', 'visual', 'style', 'film', 'also', 'aspects', 'being', 'own', 'character', 'know', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'put', 'digital', 'workshop', 'order', 'give', 'visual', 'feel', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'wanted', 'movie', 'destined', 'be', 'one', 'time', 'greats.Unfortunately', 'dvd', ""n't"", 'contain', 'commentary', 'Coens', 'stars', 'shame', 'think', 'Coen', 'commentary', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'round', 'out', 'dvd', 'perfectly', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'featurette', 'post-production', 'digital', 'process', 'are', 'good', 'menu', 'option', 'compare', 'storyboard', 'completed', 'scene', 'Klan', 'scene', 'final', 'scene', 'finally', 'Am', 'Man', 'Constant', 'Sorrow', 'music', 'video', 'complete', 'dvd', 'charming', 'video.This', 'film', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'dozen', 'times', 'will', 'continue', 'watch', 'time']","O Brother, Where Art Thou?"
534165,ASC5CH6RALOHL,B00003CXRM,"Alden Utter ""nedlum""","[4, 4]","In O Brother, Where Art Thou?, the Cohen Brothers have given us a joyful pageant of incredible wit, unforgettable characters, and indescribable music. The film takes place in a mythical South during the Great Depression, where the Klan lynches with impunity, politicians campaign with midgets, and the best way to get a car is through grand theft auto. Everett, a long winded man addicted to one brand of hair gel, has broken out of jail with the men he was, by chance, chained to: Pete, trusting and loyal, and Delmar, dull, yet kind-hearted. Together, they set out across the land, to reach the treasure that Everett had stolen before a dam flooded the land where it was buried. But that is just the pretext. Along the way, there are baptisms, arguments, a betrayal or two, near lynching, the sale of souls, and an end encounter with the sherriff... and something more. I won't say who, but keep your ears open. It is wonderfully subtle, but when you know who he truly is... It's powerful. That subtle hint is one of the many signs of genius present throughout this film.Of course, the singing is justifiably one of the best known and best loved parts of the film. Although Disney seems to have currently stepped out of the ring, O Brother proves that musicals are still a delightful form of movie. From the opening credits and ""Big Rock Candy Mountain"", to the haunting rendition of ""Oh, Death"" at the Klan Rally, up until the prophet's singing of ""Angel Band"" as he rolls toward the horizonThe characters are rich, one and all. Everett's commentary on why a blind man with no name would have trouble finding work, Delmar's remark that while Pete would be 84 when leaving prison, ""I'll only be 82."" , and Pete's apologizing to God before betraying his friends, reflect wonderful characters rare to find in any medium, created in a labor of love . And not just the main ones: from the incompetent election officials, to George Nelson, each character becomes unforgettable, instead of the vague stereotype all too common in films.As for the wit... well, as Pappy O'Daniel says, there's no accounting for taste. But from Delmar's repetitive offering of a roasted gopher to Everett to the exclamation in the midst of the haunting Klan rally that ""The color guard is colored!"" the rich dialogue and wonderful sight gags (i.e. the sheer amount of Dapper Dan Everett uses, seen at the end) lighten the darkest scene, and further show the honed Craft of the Cohen'sIn short, O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a joy of a film.

534173,A2JUR4XQAHSXT6,B00003CXRM,Amazon Customer,"[9, 67]","On 18 Feb  04, at 11:30 p.m., I watched the movie O Brother Where Art Thou.  I watched it played on a DVD medium in surround sound.  This film was produced by Touch stone / Universal pictures with help from Studio Canal and Working Title Productions.  The movie was made in 2000 and stared George Clooney in the title role.  His supporting cast was John Turturro and Tim Blake.  This film was presented in color.O Brother is a partially modernize story of Odysseus.  In this case the character George Clooney plays is called Ulysses Everett or Everett for shot.  He is on a chain gang and needs to get home.  He convinces his fellow convicts, Pete and Nelson, to escape with him.  Everett says he has stolen a million dollars and needs to get it before the valley he buried it in is flooded.  This will happen in five days, so the unlikely trio races against the clock to get home.Along the way the encounter several diversions that try to keep them from getting their prize.  First  the jump a train or at least a few of them do.  However since they are chained together they all fall out of the train.  They need to learn to work together, if they are going to make it to the money in time.Next they meet a blind man on a hand cart.  He prophesizes that they will find a treasure, but not the one they seek.  This causes some dissent among the men.  However Everett is able to keep them together and push them on.After the encounter with the blind prophet, they run into Pete's Cousin.  Hogwolop turns the three in for the bounty.  The depression is very severe and Hogwolop needs the money to save his farm.  The three are able to escape.The boys run into a baptism.  Pete and Nelson get saved but Everett decides not to. The two saved boys are ready to call it quits.  I think this parallels the encounter with the lotus eaters.  Instead of physical pleasure, the boys have a spiritual pleasure.  As such they feel that they have been absolved from sin.  Why should they move on?  Everett pushes them.They run into a black guitar player.  He tells them that they can make some money singing into a can.  They cut a record and this act gets them famous.  Even though the Soggy Bottom boys, as they are now called, do not realize it.There is an encounter with three women.  When they wake up Pete is gone and the boys think he has been turned into a frog.  Everett pushes them on.After the encounter with the three sirens they run into a one eyed bible sales man.  Big Ted tricks them into going out into the woods for lunch.  Then he kills the frog that is Pete, beats up Nelson and Everett  and then robs them.  This is a close parallel to the encounter with the Cyclops in the Odyssey.  After several more adventures they meet the Cyclopes again.  This time they defeat him.  First they attempt to spear his eye with a rebel flag.  But in the end they  land a fiery cross on top of him.There is an encounter with a suitor in the later half of the movie.  This time Everett is not the strong one and he gets his but kicked.  He has to learn that an all out attack is hopeless.  So Everett disguises himself and his buddies to sneak into a political rally and see Everett's wife.  The real reason he escaped from jail.  You find out that there is not treasure.  Everett just said that to get his chain boys to leave with him.  His wife is about to get remarried and he will do anything to stop it.  In the end, the boys get a pardon, the get new jobs, and Everett gets the girl.As for an evaluation.  I do not like George Clooney.  I think he is an arrogant actor that always seams oily.  As such this tainted my perception of the movie.  But I didn't like it just for Clooney's miserable performance.  No I didn't like it because of all the Yodeling.  I did not care for the time period or the jandra this movie was designed for.  The constant caterwauling was not music.  It was noise.  As such I could not get into the main part of the story.  Their concept that music can save ones soul.I am also nit picker when it comes to period concepts in films.  As such I was irritated that a rebel flag was used for the KKK, as their symbol, in the film.  The actual rebel flag was not adopted by the clan until the end of the second world war.  As such it should not have been used at all.  Now IK must say that I thought that their portrayal of the country store was accurate.  It wasn't until the advent of the super market that customers could actually get products themselves off of the shelves.  You needed an attendant.  This was a nice vintage touch.This is a modern rendition of the Odyssey.  However, except for a few obvious parts, the sirens and the Cyclops, I couldn't make the connection.  If you can compare O Brother Where Art Thou to The Odyssey then by all means you can compare What Dreams May Come to Dante's Inferno .Like I have stated it was a stretch.  Also I just felt the acting was lack luster and the plot was forced.  All types of little things kept happening to the convicts that pushed them along in the right direction and rewarded them.  These are prisoners.  It is hard to sympathize with them.  Yes you learn that they did their crimes for good causes, but the fact of the matter is the movie was glorifying the prisoner.  This upset me.  We have enough problems now a days without some idiot getting an idea that it is okay to be like baby face nelson and go out in a criminal ball of glory.  Morally I was opposed to this.As for the DVD the features were lacking.  I'm used to tons of extras and this DVD had little to offer.  For $15.00 I expect more for my money.  All in all I was extremely disappointed in both the film and the DVD.  I'm glad I only spent $2.62 to rent it.  Even then I felt cheated.Safe journey:David",1,This is not the Ulysses,1092614400,"08 16, 2004",2004,5756,"['18', 'Feb', '04', '11:30', 'p.m.', 'watched', 'movie', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art',

534175,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CXRM,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 4]","Love them or hate them, the Coen brothers know how to get your attention.  For me, this is surely one of their best films, and it is one that I have grown to love (considerably) over the years.  It sports Clooney's best performance to date (seriously) and one of the smartest scripts of the decade (or forever), using the powerful `Odyssey' as comic relief.  The humor is strictly `Coen' style, which is why it may not be ideal for everyone, but you can't help but totally respect what they were able to do here.I mean, this is genius, whether you `like' it or not.Set in the 1930's, `O Brother, Where Art Thou' tells of the adventures of three escaped convicts (Everett, Pete and Delmar), as they search for hidden treasure.  In true `Homer' fashion, the three convicts come across a slew of strange character that play a central part in their journey (including a brilliantly realized side-plot involving the KKK).The film reeks of style, period drama brilliance oozing from every nook and cranny of the film.  The comedic timing is flawless, and it is one of those films that really helps establish a star.  A lot of people make claim that George Clooney is a great actor, and while I like him, I find that he was certainly better `before' he became big.  His star persona skyrocketed in 2005 after he garnered Oscar nominations for his action (which he won for) and his directing, but his early 00 work is far better than what he's been putting out as of late.  His work in this film, as well as `The Perfect Storm' and `Solaris', is some of his best work ever.  I find that I appreciate George as a comedic actor over a dramatic one, his that is why his performance in `O Brother, Where Art Thou?' will remain my favorite work from him, ever.The film retains an avenue of suspense, which only helps sell the comedic overtones (think `Fargo', which would have been pointless without the dramatic underlining).  This is a stunning example of what the Coen brothers are capable of, and why they will be remembered as one of those directorial pairs that helped shape the way we look at cinema.Funny, charming, dark, mysterious; full of breathtaking cinematography, appropriate (and catchy) music and memorable performances (John Goodman, a Coen staple, is magnificent as always), `O Brother, Where Art Thou?' is a film you won't soon forget.",5,"O Brother, what a great movie!",1267488000,"03 2, 2010",2010,2342,"['Love', 'hate', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'know', 'how', 'get', 'attention', 'surely', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'one', 'have', 'grown', 'love', 'considerably', 'years', 'sports', 'Clooney', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'seriously', 'one', 'smartest', 'scripts', 'decade', 'forever', 'using', 'powerful', 'Odyssey', 'comic', 'relief', 'humor', 'strictly', 'Coen', 'style', 'why', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'ideal', 'everyone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'totally', 'respect', 'what', 'were', 'able', 'do', 'here.I', 'mean', 'genius', 'not.Set', '1930', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', 'tells', 'adventures', 'three', 'escaped', 'convicts', 'Everett', 'Pete', 'Delmar', 'search', 'hidden', 'treasure', 'true', 'Homer', 'fashion', 'three', 'convicts', 'come', 'slew', 'strange', 'character', 'play', 'central', 'part', 'journey', 'including', 'brilliantly', 'realized', 'side-plot', 'involving', 'KKK', '.The', 'film', 'reeks', 'style', 'period', 'drama', 'brilliance', 'oozing', 'nook', 'cranny', 'film', 'comedic', 'timing', 'flawless', 'one', 'films', 'really', 'establish', 'star', 'lot', 'people', 'make', 'claim', 'George', 'Clooney', 'great', 'actor', 'like', 'find', 'was', 'certainly', 'better', 'before', 'became', 'big', 'star', 'persona', 'skyrocketed', '2005', 'garnered', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'action', 'won', 'directing', 'early', '00', 'work', 'far', 'better', 'what', 'been', 'putting', 'out', 'late', 'work', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'Solaris', 'best', 'work', 'ever', 'find', 'appreciate', 'George', 'comedic', 'actor', 'dramatic', 'one', 'why', 'performance', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', 'will', 'remain', 'favorite', 'work', 'ever.The', 'film', 'avenue', 'suspense', 'only', 'sell', 'comedic', 'overtones', 'think', 'Fargo', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'pointless', 'dramatic', 'underlining', 'stunning', 'example', 'what', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'are', 'capable', 'why', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'one', 'directorial', 'pairs', 'helped', 'shape', 'way', 'look', 'cinema.Funny', 'charming', 'dark', 'mysterious', 'full', 'breathtaking', 'cinematography', 'appropriate', 'catchy', 'music', 'memorable', 'performances', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Coen', 'staple', 'magnificent', 'always', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'soon', 'forget']","O Brother, Where Art Thou?"

A behind-the-scenes presentation features interviews and observations from the brothers as well as major actors and technical people; a music video of the breakaway single &quot;A Man of Constant Sorrow&quot;; a documentary about the unique digital colorization techniques used for the film; and (my favorite) three scenes which can be run as a simulcast of the film with storyboard panels.

Truly, the Coen Brothers are cinematic geniuses I now acknowledge!  &quot;Fargo&quot; was excellent, but not great as this one is.  I didn't see all five nominated films for Best Picture this year, but I cannot believe that ANY one was superior to this one.  Granted, the Coens were not marketing the film to the usual 14-year-old money-making mentality of most of the recent blockbuster American films, but  in its comedic brilliance, the Brothers skirt thither and yon with articulation rarely seen; they combine the best nuances of the Foreign Film with the power that American films can (but usually don't) produce.  The clever literary allusions crocheted tantalizingly with Southern Depression lore was excruciatingly&quot;to the point,&quot; and with refreshing originality (another rarity in Hollywood)!  And George Clooney--who'd have thought he could pull off such a role (one tends to remember him as that doctor on that tv program) deserved his honors, and, again, I cannot believe whoever it was who won the Oscar did a better job of acting. (Yes, Mr. Crowe, I mean it!)  Yes, the box office won again, which is the downside of American movie awards, it seems.Clooney's two sidekicks hold their own, easily--actually, they do more than that:  they keep Clooney aloft!  Charles Durning, John Goodman, and Holly Hunter merely gild the lily.  Homer, indeed, is impressed, spinning in his grave, as he must be, to see &quot;The Odyssey&quot; in such a new, and invigorating, light.  With all the bravado and the zany activities, the Coens squeeze in, sometimes subtly, sometimes not, more than a few lessons in social significance, yet without preaching.  One doesn't have to be well-versed in this period of American history (although it must help to recognize the  allusions!) to appreciate the film.

534201,A14LIZKKA7WYT9,B00003CXRM,brigsbmc@cs.com,"[8, 11]","O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? was one of the best films I saw all year.  Ethan and Joel Coen(FARGO,  THE BIG LEBOWSKI,  RAISING ARIZONA) have written a movie using the ancient story line to The Odyssey and turned it into the tale of a man's determination to escape prison and stop his wife from re-marrying.  The sheer brilliance of this movie deserves an applause.  Set in the Depression Era,  this comedy/musical(if you will) begins with Everett,  Pete,  and Delmar escaping off the chain gang.  Everett has told them that he has buried 1.2 million dollars near his home,  and they must get to it before the land is made into a river.  Thus begins this amazing movie with countless allusions to The Odyssey.  The blind prophet from the story becomes the blind railway man who tells the men they will go on a quest.  Then,  the men are seduced by three women singing,  the Sirens of course.  And who can forget the one-eyed man Big Dan Teague showing the ruthlessness of the Cyclops?  All in all,  this movie's great script(nominated for an Oscar) and awesome performances make this movie great fun.  George Clooney is incredible as Everett,  and this is the role which won him the Golden Globe award for Best Actor, beating out such stars as Mel Gibson,  Robert Deniro,  John Cusack,  and Jim Carrey.  John Turturro is a chameleon,  a brilliant character actor and great in this movie as Pete.  One of the best played roles is that of Delmar,  played by Tim Blake Nelson.  He is a perfect comic relief character and I feel the most likeable of the three.  In the supporting areas,  John Goodman rocks as Big Dan Teague,  and he can now be called somewhat of a Coen Brothers regular,  having been in THE BIG LEBOWSKI and RAISING ARIZONA.  Holly Hunter,  also a Raising Arizona alum plays a perfect and motherly Penny,  Everett's wife.  Charles Durning is a fiery and strong as Guv'nor Pappy O'Daniel,  as are Chris Thomas King and The Practice's Michael Badalucco.  Wayne Duvall is very good as the rival Homer Stokes.  The really wonderful part of this movie is the music.  In a way,  this comedy is somewhat like a musical,  the music carrying the men from one place to another,  and I especially love the scenes in which the three men and their accomp..uhh,  accompanist(It's a joke from the movie,  see it,  and you'll get it) Tommy roll into &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow.&quot;  An awesome Coen Brothers Flick!",5,The Coen Brothers are Geniuses!,989020800,"05 5, 2001",2001,2412,"['O', 'BROTHER', 'WHERE', 'ART', 'THOU', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'saw', 'year', 'Ethan', 'Joel', 'Coen', 'FARGO', 'THE', 'BIG', 'LEBOWSKI', 'RAISING', 'ARIZONA', 'have', 'written', 'movie', 'using', 'ancient', 'story', 'line', 'Odyssey', 'turned', 'tale', 'man', 'determination', 'escape', 'prison', 'stop', 'wife', 're-marrying', 'sheer', 'brilliance', 'movie', 'applause', 'Set', 'Depression', 'Era', 'comedy/musical', 'will', 'Everett', 'Pete', 'Delmar', 'escaping', 'off', 'chain', 'gang', 'Everett', 'told', 'buried', '1.2', 'million', 'dollars', 'home', 'must', 'get', 'land', 'made', 'river', 'Thus', 'amazing', 'movie', 'countless', 'allusions', 'Odyssey', 'blind', 'prophet', 'story', 'blind', 'railway', 'man', 'who', 'men', 'will', 'go', 'quest', 'Then', 'men', 'are', 'seduced', 'three', 'women', 'singing', 'Sirens', 'course', 'who', 'can', 'forget', 'one-eyed', 'man', 'Big', 'Dan', 'Teague', 'showing', 'ruthlessness', 'Cyclops', 'movie', 'great', 'script', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'awesome', 'performances', 'make', 'movie', 'great', 'fun', 'George', 'Clooney', 'incredible', 'Everett', 'role', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'award', 'Best', 'Actor', 'beating', 'out', 'such', 'stars', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Robert', 'Deniro', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'John', 'Turturro', 'chameleon', 'brilliant', 'character', 'actor', 'great', 'movie', 'Pete', 'One', 'best', 'played', 'roles', 'Delmar', 'played', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'perfect', 'comic', 'relief', 'character', 'feel', 'most', 'likeable', 'three', 'supporting', 'areas', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Big', 'Dan', 'Teague', 'can', 'now', 'be', 'called', 'somewhat', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'regular', 'having', 'been', 'THE', 'BIG', 'LEBOWSKI', 'RAISING', 'ARIZONA', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'also', 'Raising', 'Arizona', 'alum', 'perfect', 'motherly', 'Penny', 'Everett', 'wife', 'Charles', 'Durning', 'fiery', 'strong', ""Guv'nor"", 'Pappy', ""O'Daniel"", 'are', 'Chris', 'Thomas', 'King', 'Practice', 'Michael', 'Badalucco', 'Wayne', 'Duvall', 'very', 'good', 'rival', 'Homer', 'Stokes', 'really', 'wonderful', 'part', 'movie', 'music', 'way', 'comedy', 'somewhat', 'musical', 'music', 'carrying', 'men', 'one', 'place', 'especially', 'love', 'scenes', 'three', 'men', 'accomp..uhh', 'accompanist', 'joke', 'movie', 'see', ""'ll"", 'get', 'Tommy', 'roll', 'quot', 'Man', 'Constant', 'Sorrow.', 'quot', 'awesome', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'Flick']","O Brother, Where Art Thou?"

He does a wonderful acting job in this movie and no one could have been more suprised than I was to discover him as an actor. Clooney forms a trio, along with John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson, of fugitives from a chain gang in Depression era Mississippi. This is the ultimate road movie with characters throughout that could have only come from the Coens' incredible imaginations.  Real life is even interspered throughout with the trio catching a ride, for example, with &quot;Baby Face Nelson,&quot; the notorious manic-depressive bank robber. Ulysses Everett McGill is the name of Clooney's slick con man character and this is because this story is a retelling of the &quot;Odyssey&quot; via the Coen brothers.  Homer and the Coens together are a delightful combination, much more enjoyable than my reading of the source work back in high school.  The soundtrack of music from this era is fabulous too.  Our trio can even sing and makes a impressive debut as the &quot;Soggy Bottom Boys.&quot;  There are so many great scenes in this film that I could go on and on but I'll just highlight a few.  There is a Klu Klux Klan rally musical number that is only rivaled by &quot;Springtime For Hitler&quot; in &quot;The Producers.&quot;  It is a superb music and dance number of the proposed lynching of a black man! Then there is the biblical flood that looms over all but in this case is the creation of the TVA dam.  The Coens manage to make creation of the TVA into high comic film art, no small feat. The trio also runs into the Sirens, just like happens in the epic poem.  In this case they are three damsels washing in the river and singing who beguile the trio.  From this encounter flows the comic wonder of Tim Blake Nelson over his belief that the sirens may have transformed Turturro into a frog.

The best part of the movie was its ability to put you into the feel of the south/midwest back in the 1920/1930 depression era.  The movie had a slap-stick-like humor and somewhat corny but very cute dialog.  The best part of the movie, I felt, was the cinematography and dialog, which wonderfully placed one back in the early 1920-1930's.

534212,A17N23WXA7EAF,B00003CXRM,"C. Colt ""It Just Doesn't Matter""","[9, 10]","""Oh Brother Where Art Thou"" is a wonderful film, especially if you accept it on its own terms instead of judging it by any personal preconceptions such as what a depression-era story should say, or how faithful and accurate a modern interpretation of the Odyssey should be. The film has a light-hearted goofiness to be sure, but this is part of its charm and part of what makes it work.Oh Brother is the story of three escaped convicts lead by the garrulous Ulysses Everett McGill. On their way to McGill's buried treasure, the convicts experience the Cohen brothers' twisted and hilarious versions of the blind soothsayer, the sirens, the Cyclops, and other Homeric characters. Both the Homeric characters and ensuing events hardly follow those of the Odyssey itself. In fact, they are more like road markers in the film than elements in the plot structure. In the end, Ulysses' wins his duel with his wife, Penelope's suitors not with physical prowess but with music. These characters are mixed with some Southern legends such as a ""baby faced"" serial bank robber who does it for the thrill and a talented black guitarist who claims to have traded his soul to the devil for his musical gift.Music is in fact the universal current of this film, which begins with a chain gang singing as they break rocks on the side of the road. Music draws the convicts to baptismal ceremonies in the woods and to the treacherous arms of the sirens. It enables them to con money from a blind radio station owner and ultimately proves to be their salvation. Some reviewers have commented that music provides this film with most of its artistic and thematic depth, and I agree with them. Just as the Cohen brothers seem to take their light hearted, Southern stereotypes a little too far, the music reorients us to the fact that these are real people living in a time of intense misery and struggle.Some people may not like this film because the convicts lack depth of character. But I think the convicts are not meant to appeal to us with realism as much as they are a throwback to 30's era films.  There is something fantastic and whimsical about this film but I think this will only bother people who expect the film to take itself seriously. ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou"" is an exploration of Homeric themes, Southern culture, the impact of music, and a bygone era of film making. The Cohen brothers chose to do this with ironic whimsy, which may understandably irritate some people, but which worked for me.",5,Excellent if you accept it for what it is,993600000,"06 27, 2001",2001,2492,"['Oh', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', 'wonderful', 'film', 'especially', 'accept', 'own', 'terms', 'instead', 'judging', 'personal', 'preconceptions', 'such', 'what', 'depression-era', 'story', 'should', 'say', 'how', 'faithful', 'accurate', 'modern', 'interpretation', 'Odyssey', 'should', 'be', 'film', 'light-hearted', 'goofiness', 'be', 'sure', 'part', 'charm', 'part', 'what', 'work.Oh', 'Brother', 'story', 'three', 'escaped', 'convicts', 'lead', 'garrulous', 'Ulysses', 'Everett', 'McGill', 'way', 'McGill', 'buried', 'treasure', 'convicts', 'experience', 'Cohen', 'brothers', 'twisted', 'hilarious', 'versions', 'blind', 'soothsayer', 'sirens', 'Cyclops', 'other', 'Homeric', 'characters', 'Homeric', 'characters', 'ensuing', 'events', 'hardly', 'follow', 'Odyssey', 'fact', 'are', 'more', 'road', 'markers', 'film', 'elements', 'plot', 'structure', 'end', 'Ulysses', 'wins', 'duel', 'wife', 'Penelope', 'suitors', 'not', 'physical', 'prowess', 'music', 'characters', 'are', 'mixed', 'Southern', 'legends', 'such', 'baby', 'faced', 'serial', 'bank', 'robber', 'who', 'thrill', 'talented', 'black', 'guitarist', 'who', 'have', 'traded', 'soul', 'devil', 'musical', 'gift.Music', 'fact', 'universal', 'current', 'film', 'chain', 'gang', 'singing', 'break', 'rocks', 'side', 'road', 'Music', 'convicts', 'baptismal', 'ceremonies', 'woods', 'treacherous', 'arms', 'sirens', 'con', 'money', 'blind', 'radio', 'station', 'owner', 'ultimately', 'be', 'salvation', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'music', 'film', 'most', 'artistic', 'thematic', 'depth', 'agree', 'Just', 'Cohen', 'brothers', 'seem', 'take', 'light', 'hearted', 'Southern', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'music', 'fact', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'living', 'time', 'intense', 'misery', 'struggle.Some', 'people', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'film', 'convicts', 'lack', 'depth', 'character', 'think', 'convicts', 'are', 'not', 'meant', 'appeal', 'realism', 'as', 'much', 'are', 'throwback', '30', 'era', 'films', 'something', 'fantastic', 'whimsical', 'film', 'think', 'will', 'only', 'bother', 'people', 'who', 'expect', 'film', 'take', 'seriously', 'Oh', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', 'exploration', 'Homeric', 'themes', 'Southern', 'culture', 'impact', 'music', 'bygone', 'era', 'film', 'making', 'Cohen', 'brothers', 'chose', 'do', 'ironic', 'whimsy', 'may', 'understandably', 'irritate', 'people', 'worked']","O Brother, Where Art Thou?"
534213,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B00003CXRM,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[2, 2]","""... I figured it should be the one with the capacity for abstract thought...""The Cohen Brothers, Ethan and Joel, have a certain style as co-directors, and they have certain regulars who often turn up in their ensemble casts: John Turturro, Holly Hunter and John Goodman from OBWAT? have been in Cohen Brothers' films before. OBWAT? is similar in some ways to other Cohen Brothers' films such as Fargo, The Big Lebowski, or Raising Arizona, but it stands out, even among Cohen Brothers' films, as a singular achievement. It has been described by them as ""a hay seed Lawrence of Arabia."" It is also a Three Stooges film, with Clooney as Moe, Turturro as Larry, and Tim Blake Nelson as Curly. There is a bit of Popeye, a bit of Ma and Pa Kettle, and yes, the story is based loosely--very loosely--on Homer's Odyssey. The film addresses lofty topics like racial intolerance and political corruption, but in a very humorous way. The film has its own color--kind of a hot and dusty yellow--and music is an integral part of the cinematic OBWAT? experience. While not a musical per se, there is a plethora of blues, gospel, and 'old timey' music to savor. All of these diverse elements are combined here under the able direction of Joel and Ethan Cohen.""... pick up the pieces and retie the knot, mixaphorically speaking... ""Not content to rest merely on their directing laurels, The Brothers Cohen also contribute to the film with their writing. Homer is listed as one of the writers (and good luck getting him or his estate paid their royalties, since none of them are to my knowledge members of the Writers' Guild). Like Homer's Odyssey, a man takes a journey that takes him far from home, but he longs to return to his wife and family before she succumbs to other suitors' advances. Along the way he encounters challenges, such as a Cyclops and some very seductive sirens. But it is what the Brothers Cohen do with the narrative structure provided by the Odyssey that stamps OBWAT? as a Cohen Brothers' product. Especially the dialogue, in particular the words spoken by George Clooney as Ulysses Everett McGill. He speaks with the eloquence of a backwoods philosopher, but sometimes his thought process is flawed, mixaphorically speaking. He sees himself as having the ""capacity for abstract thought"" but those thoughts are at times perhaps a bit too abstract to be practical. Though his thoughts aren't always logical, as he tells Pete, ""it's a fool that looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart.""""... I guess I'm the only one that remains unaffiliated ...""Clooney is perhaps best known as a dramatic actor, but he has an undeniable flair for comedy. His McGill is quite a creation--an arrogant buffoon who thinks he knows it all while he clearly does not, and yet he is quite endearing. He is kind of a snob, refusing to use FOP because he is a Dapper Dan man, and yet somehow the audience can't resist his obvious charm. John Turturro is a bit harsher as Pete Hogwallop, but he also wins over the audience. Another brilliant characterization for this talented actor. Tim Blake Nelson is a revelation as the naive, good hearted chain gang escapee Delmar O'Donnell. One is reminded of Buster Keaton when TBN is onscreen. The dead pan expression that says it all.""Do you have the Soggy Bottom Boys performing ""Man of Constant Sorrow""?I had the good fortune of seeing Alison Krause and Union Station perform in Bakersfield when they were riding high on the crest of the OBWAT? wave. The guitarist for this group, Dan Tyminski, is the guy who actually sang ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" while Clooney lip synched it. T-Bone Burnett did a fantastic job producing the music for this odyssey. From the seductive song of the sirens, to the blues of Tommy Johnson, and the hit song of those fabled Soggy Bottom boys, or the gospel numbers like ""I'll Fly Away"" it was all top notch. The soundtrack all but swept the Grammies, very unusual for a sound track LP, but understandable, given the caliber of the music.""... if not smithies per se, were you otherwise trained in the metallurgic arts before straitened circumstances forced you into a life of aimless wanderin'?""One final thing I'd like to mention about OBWAT? is the cinematography. The film was shot in the traditional manner, on film, but then the images were manipulated digitally, to give the film a dry and dusty look, like an old time sepia toned photograph, and watching it, you almost feel like you are Grapes of Wrath migrants fleeing the dust bowl in the depression, or chain gang escapees with hell hounds on your tail. The DVD contains bonus material, and one of the segments details the way that color was used to enhance the look, by digitally altering it. They pioneered some cutting edge film processes, and in spite of how modern that may be, it all went toward creating a look that made you feel like you'd traveled back in a time machine to the dry yellow dust bowl of the depression era.""Well, that right there may be the reason you've had difficulty findin' gainful employment. You see, in the mart of competitive commerce... ""In conclusion, OBWAT? was a triumph that featured excellent directing and writing from Joel & Ethan Cohen, great acting from Clooney, Turturro, Nelson, and the rest of the ensemble, fabulous music put together by T-Bone Burnett, and great cinematography.

By most standards, this is a pretty decent movie; by Coen movie standards, comparing it to &quot;Blood Simple&quot; and &quot;Fargo,&quot; it doesn't quite come up to snuff.Very very very loosely based on Homer's &quot;Odyssey&quot; (the Coens admit that they have never read Homer), this movie feels more like a series of vignettes, only marginally connected to each other, loosely strung together.  Some of the scenes, such as the revival down at the river, really don't seem to make much sense and do little to advance the storyline.  Compared to some of the excellently constructed scripts of the other Coen movies, this plotline meanders considerably.

The humor is not your typical hollywood guy running down the street with butt showing..instead this is the thinking person humorous movie.  I have met people who simply didn't get this movie because they fail to see the humor of the dialoge.Hollywood has programmed this generation that if the joke doesn't revolve around sex or nudity it can't be funny.  One of the best parts of this movie is the ability to see the level of humor in polar opposite such as Everett and Delmar.  The two are complete mental opposies.  Everett is the &quot;brains&quot; and Delmar is the &quot;lack there of&quot;.  I think the balance of this movie is found in these two characters.However, the two  characters are joined by a third person who fills in the gaps of Everett and Delmar.  His name was Pete.  Now Pete seems a cut above Delmar mentally but, he falls short of Everett.  So what we find is a nice mix of Intellivence,Ignorance, and dumb innocense.  The 3 amigos face challenge after challenge to reach &quot;the treasure&quot;.  Along the way, they find abilities they didn't know they had, make friends with bible salesman, and pick up hitch-hickers.

Being an adaptation does not allow for much in the way of imagination. One much do what one can with what one is given. The weakest points were those with Everett (George Clooney in a terrific comic departure from his normal ""cool guy"" roles) and Penny (Holly Hunter), the Ulysses/Penelope story. I also felt not enough was done with the Sirens.The performances are top-flight all around, with only Pete (John Turturro) not given much to do.

Hopefully, some of the religious digs were tongue-in-cheek and not meant in a mean-spirited way, but I'm not sure, especially considering the Coen Brothers made it.The music in here is super, led by the catchy ""Man Of Constant Sorrow,"" performed by Dan Tyminski.

534234,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B00003CXRM,Craig MACKINNON,"[0, 4]","First - the movie.  Three convicts escape from a chain-gang and set of on a quest, supposedly based on the Odyssey, although the Coens later claimed to have never read it.  However, we have Sirens who abduct one of the escapees, a Cyclops (played by John Goodman), and a Penny (Penelope).  In addition, we have less obvious characters, such as a manic-depressive bank robber, a KKK-belonging gubernatorial candidate, and his populist encumbant opponent.  All of these characters provide some big laughs, little chuckles, and a healthy dose of bluegrass music.  It's all presented in a washed-out colour that lends a beautiful visual style to the piece.The film has most of the hallmarks of the Coen brothers.  This depression-era Mississippi didn't ever exist, but we wish it did.  It's filled with caricature characters with amusing quirks and one-track minds.  Missing is the occasional brutal violence that has a tendency to crop up in some of their work.  As such, this is one of the most good-hearted of the Coens' films, and I enjoyed it more than, say, Fargo.  However, it's probably more forgettable than their other work.  In addition, the film is almost a musical with its profusion of tunes.  However, I'm not much of a bluegrass fan, so found that the musical parts, though well-done, could have been shortened.  It moved just a little too slowly and lingered just a little too long in these passages.Secondly - the DVD version.  Obviously, the sound and picture is very good, but the DVD left me disappointed.  Who could be more interesting in a commentary track than the Coen brothers?  Alas, there is no commentary - the best we get is a making of featurette that is only 20 minutes or so.

His partners played by John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson complete the ensemble of misfits.There are some readily recognizable episodes from the Odyssey imaginatively set in the 1930's South. The most pleasing is John Goodman as the Cyclops. The music is placed throughout the movie and seems a natural counterpart to the performance. The movie is well acted and constructed.However, as with all the Coen films, their humour is inevitably at the expense of a disadvantaged demographic. Their films habitually exploit the setting and people in rural, geographically depressed areas. What is funny about this? It is pity that they feel they have the right to mine this material in the first place, and it is a pity that their imaginations cannot extend beyond it.There is a limited appeal to the Coen films which I'm sure they rationalize as being misunderstood by the wider audience.

First of all let's get one thing straight, this movie is not based on the odyssey.  Apart from the siren scene, the fact that Clooney's character is named Ulyssees and that his wife is named Penelope there are no similarities.  The movie does have it's highlights (a muffed KKK ralley for example where the Coens make the sheet toting idiots out to be the total morons that they are) but I think the predominance of bluegrass music really threw me off.

534255,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00003CXRM,Dennis Littrell,"[2, 4]","This depression era period piece is simply a delight.  The music is wonderful; the fanciful, on the road story of lovable escaped convict country bumpkins, who pratfall their way through numerous scrapes invites hilarity; and the beautifully dove-tailed script by the Coen brothers is marvelous.That script was nominated for the Oscar for Best Screenplay based on material from another medium for 2001, but didn't win.  (Stephen Gaghan won for Traffic.)  But never mind.  The writing is just so clever and that is part of what makes this movie so much fun to watch.That won't surprise viewers who are familiar with the work of Ethan and Joel Coen.  Those guys are strikingly original talents who can write comedy and noir with the best of them as in, e.g., Raising Arizona (1987), Blood Simple (1984)--their first, and in some ways, their best--and of course Fargo (1996).  Their work is characterized by irony, satirical intent, and sly plotting in which later events are foreshadowed by previous events.  O, Brother, Where Art Thou? is especially replete with clever foreshadowing.  Characters appear, as they are wont to do in road movies or epic wanderings, and then they are left behind as our heroes move on.  Here however, the first appearance of a character is probably not the last appearance.  When John Goodman first appears as a morally and ethnically-challenged Bible salesman who welds a mean stick, we may think he is gone, but (I'll keep this vague) when he reappears we are not surprised; in fact his reappearance is just right.One of the highlights is George Clooney as Ulysses Everett McGill whose sweet-smelling Dapper Dan hair pomade plays a bit of a role in the plot.  He is perfect as a slick-talking, hairnet-wearing country wordsmith who could charm the birds out of the trees.  With the slicked-back hair and the thin moustache, he reminded me a bit of Clark Gable, which is only right since Gable was a thirties film star whose style was much imitated.Clooney is supported by John Turturro, who has played in at least two other Coen and Coen movies that I have seen.  He is one of those non-glamourous actors who is at the top of the profession.  It may seem a bit of a casting stretch to play him as a Mississippi bumpkin, but he pulls it off.  This is the same guy who was just perfect as a New York Jewish writer gone to Hollywood in Coen and Coen's Barton Fink (1991).This is the first time I've seen Tim Blake Nelson, but he was also very good as the third country musketeer.  As usual the alluring Holly Hunter gives a solid performance as Everett's estranged wife about to marry another man, the mother of his six daughters.  But make no mistake about it, Clooney clearly steals the show, and I am surprised he wasn't nominated for Best Actor.  He was really that good.  (He did win a Golden Globe award.)And the music: country, bluegrass, hillbilly, gospel, traditional--and I know not what else--is really at the heart of the flick.  When the ""Soggy Bottom Boys"" come on with their ""I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow"" it really brings the house down.  The Coens know this, and so later in the movie when the boys appear on stage, looking a little like ZZTop on a budget, they reprise it to the delight of the Mississippi folk at a political rally and really get the joint to jumping--and of course it all figures in the plot.  And how appropriate is that lyric for a depression era song: ""I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow""!See this for both the Coen Brothers who know how to have fun with a movie, and for George Clooney, who puts on a mighty good show.",5,You're gonna love this movie,1111449600,"03 22, 2005",2005,3582,"['depression', 'era', 'period', 'piece', 'simply', 'delight', 'music', 'wonderful', 'fanciful', 'road', 'story', 'lovable', 'escaped', 'convict', 'country', 'bumpkins', 'who', 'pratfall', 'way', 'numerous', 'scrapes', 'hilarity', 'beautifully', 'dove-tailed', 'script', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'marvelous.That', 'script', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'based', 'material', 'medium', '2001', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'Stephen', 'Gaghan', 'won', 'Traffic', 'never', 'mind', 'writing', 'just', 'so', 'clever', 'part', 'what', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch.That', 'wo', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'work', 'Ethan', 'Joel', 'Coen', 'guys', 'are', 'strikingly', 'original', 'talents', 'who', 'can', 'write', 'comedy', 'noir', 'best', 'e.g.', 'Raising', 'Arizona', '1987', 'Blood', 'Simple', '1984', 'first', 'ways', 'best', 'course', 'Fargo', '1996', 'work', 'characterized', 'irony', 'satirical', 'intent', 'sly', 'plotting', 'later', 'events', 'are', 'foreshadowed', 'previous', 'events', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', 'especially', 'replete', 'clever', 'foreshadowing', 'Characters', 'appear', 'are', 'wont', 'do', 'road', 'movies', 'epic', 'wanderings', 'then', 'are', 'left', 'heroes', 'move', 'Here', 'however', 'first', 'appearance', 'character', 'probably', 'not', 'last', 'appearance', 'When', 'John', 'Goodman', 'first', 'morally', 'ethnically-challenged', 'Bible', 'salesman', 'who', 'mean', 'stick', 'may', 'think', 'gone', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'vague', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'surprised', 'fact', 'reappearance', 'just', 'right.One', 'highlights', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Ulysses', 'Everett', 'McGill', 'sweet-smelling', 'Dapper', 'Dan', 'hair', 'pomade', 'bit', 'role', 'plot', 'perfect', 'slick-talking', 'hairnet-wearing', 'country', 'wordsmith', 'who', 'could', 'charm', 'birds', 'trees', 'slicked-back', 'hair', 'thin', 'moustache', 'reminded', 'bit', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'only', 'right', 'Gable', 'was', 'thirties', 'film', 'star', 'style', 'was', 'much', 'imitated.Clooney', 'supported', 'John', 'Turturro', 'who', 'played', 'least', 'two', 'other', 'Coen', 'Coen', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'non-glamourous', 'actors', 'who', 'top', 'profession', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'casting', 'stretch', 'play', 'Mississippi', 'bumpkin', 'off', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'perfect', 'New', 'York', 'Jewish', 'writer', 'gone', 'Hollywood', 'Coen', 'Coen', 'Barton', 'Fink', '1991', '.This', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'third', 'country', 'musketeer', 'usual', 'alluring', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'solid', 'performance', 'Everett', 'estranged', 'wife', 'marry', 'man', 'mother', 'six', 'daughters', 'make', 'mistake', 'Clooney', 'clearly', 'show', 'am', 'surprised', 'was', ""n't"", 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actor', 'was', 'really', 'that', 'good', 'did', 'win', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'award', 'music', 'country', 'bluegrass', 'hillbilly', 'gospel', 'traditional', 'know', 'not', 'what', 'else', 'really', 'heart', 'flick', 'When', 'Soggy', 'Bottom', 'Boys', 'come', 'Am', 'Man', 'Constant', 'Sorrow', 'really', 'house', 'down', 'Coens', 'know', 'so', 'later', 'movie', 'when', 'boys', 'appear', 'stage', 'looking', 'little', 'like', 'ZZTop', 'budget', 'reprise', 'delight', 'Mississippi', 'folk', 'political', 'rally', 'really', 'get', 'joint', 'jumping', 'course', 'figures', 'plot', 'how', 'appropriate', 'lyric', 'depression', 'era', 'song', 'Am', 'Man', 'Constant', 'Sorrow', 'See', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'who', 'know', 'how', 'have', 'fun', 'movie', 'George', 'Clooney', 'who', 'mighty', 'good', 'show']","O Brother, Where Art Thou?"

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 0]","Only the Coen brothers would be warped enough to come up with a tribute to the The Odyssey based in Depression Era Mississippi in their entertaining O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?  Only the Ulysses this time is an escaped con, who along with two cohorts, embark on a surreal journey searching for an alleged ""loot"" that will make them rich beyond their wildest dreams.  But they're already rich and famous--they just don't know it.  Joining a fourth man who has just sold his soul to the devil to play the guitar, they record ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" in a cracker box studio, calling themselves the Soggy Bottom Boys; the tune becomes a statewide sensation.  Yet Ulysses and his group are constantly on the run, primarily from prison guards intent on inflicting their own vigilante justice; en route the runaways encounter just about everything, from seductive sirens to a one-eyed con. . .even a choreographed Klan rally.  Yet as this delightful film comes to its climax, we learn the real reason Ulysses wants to escape from prison.George Clooney is sensational as Ulysses Everett McGill, a smooth-talking persuader with a weakness for Dapper Dan pomade (no doubt a tongue-in-cheek spoof to Clooney himself). But even better are John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson as Pete and Delmar, the fellow cons who escape with Ulysses.  Both sport enough clueless facial expressions and thick hick twang to make Hee Haw look like Masterpiece Theater.  John Goodman, always remarkably good, has a brief role as a one-eyed Bible salesman--a salesman with other intentions up his sleeve.  And the rest of the cast more than holds its own.  But the real stars of O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? are the imaginative Coens, who through their images and music and settings serve us up a slice of Down South Americana. It's definitely humor with a dark edge; the flawlessly choreographed Klan rally (conjuring images of Nuremberg) is fabulously funny, yet its ugly point is unmistakably made.  Sometimes a bit too whimsical, O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? is still a grand satirical tribute to one of the oldest tales of time.--D.

I never read it, but I've heard that it's a bit similar, but not completely like it.  It stars George Clooney who really surprised me in this movie! I am not much of a fan, and I thought he was very good as the prisoner who breaks loose from a chain gang.  He's kind of the one is charge, and the two men he drags along don't want him to be the one who's boss. One is played by John Turtorro, and well, honestly I have no idea who the other actor is, but he is very good and extremely funny in this movie  They are all on the lam together, and as Clooney is trying to get back to his wife and family the thre of them have adventures -- not all good ones.  They even start a singing career as the Soggy Bottom Boys.  All the songs are old folk and blue grass songs, and the actors lip synch.  I really thought it was Clooney singing the first time I saw this!  The singing and dancing really brings great delight to this very sunny little movie. It kind of reminded me of The Wizard of Oz in that way.  There is even one scene where they view KKK members marching around while hiding behind a bush.  They eventually manage to get three of the members and steal their uniforms to save a man from being killed...In the wizard of Oz, the three friends of Dorothy watch the henchmen for the witch march around and eventually steal uniforms from three of the men.  There is even similar chanting in O Brother... I don't want to give anything else away, but JOhn Goodman plays one of the many people they meet along their journey, and Stephen Root, who is a very funny character actor(the boss on Newsradio) plays a blind dj, who made me howl with laughter. Holly Hunter is in it as Clooney's estranged wife Penelope. The best thing I really loved about this movie is the music.  I bought the soundtrack the next day, and it is awesome.  If you are fan of folk and bluegrass, you'll absolutely love this soundtrack.  It's a very funny film that is well acted and beautifully filmed.

But, I'm jumping ahead...let's get to the review.The opening sequence is a great musical experience which begins with a 1930's singing chain gang, voiced by James Carter and the Prisoners (found on your best Blues collections.) That goes straight to ""Big Rock Cany Mountain,"" a bluegrass favorite, as we cut to Pete, Delmar and Everett hauling ass through a field, having escaped the gang and are searching for freedom. Amazing way to open the credits.Once the boys are on their way, we get to meet them. Everett, played by Clooney, is a know-it-all with an obvious education and a vain care for his hair. Pete is an angry country boy who loves conflict - John Turturro is great in this part. Delmar is their sometimes innocent, always simple-minded end to the trio. Everett has talked the other two into escaping with him to find the treasure he stole, buried, and was sent to jail for.This is a sometimes loose adaptation of Homer's ""The Odyssey."" The Cohen Brothers have admitted to never reading the book but they seem to have really studied the cliff notes front to back. If you look closely, you can find every piece of the film's inside to the poem. For instance:The prisoners find a blind railpusher who tells their future just as Odysseus was told his by Tiresius.Everett's first name Ulysees is Roman for the Greek Odysseus.The Sheriff plays the part of the Devil. But, I think, the GOV candidate is supposed to be Poseiden. THAT IS made thinkable by the fact that the CYCLOPS/John Goodman is his minion.The trance-like prayer flock that goes to the river to pray are just like the drug-addicted ""lotus eaters"" that Odysseus has to keep his troop away from.John Goodman's Dan with the eyepatch is one-half of the ""Cyclops."" The other half of the Cyclops (which Odysseus outsmarts) is the blind radio announcer that Everett swindles out of extra money.When Everett goes to find his estranged wife Penny (Odysseus' Penelope), he finds that she has found a suitor. Odysseus finds his wife and family overtaken by many suitors.Everett gets beaten down by the suitor just as Odysseus gets jumped by many suitors.It goes on but I won't list them all. What I want to mention the most here is the sterling sountrack. It's got a little blues, a shade of country, but tons of bluegrass that I had no idea I was a fan of until I saw the movie. Great favorites all around, well integrated into the movie. Parts that I loved the most in the film are...""Damn! We're in a tight spot!"" (you'll know what I mean)The opening.Tommy the guitar player.The major-hot Sirens.Every time the boys sing ""Man of Constant Sorrow.""""Angel Band"" from the end credits.It really is one of the Cohen Brothers' best.

The Coen Brothers (&quot;Fargo,&quot; &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;) doing a retelling of Homer's The Odyssey, set in depression-era Mississippi, filled with a stellar soundtrack, the usual Coen cast plus George Clooney, and an homage to Preston Sturges. And it is pretty cool, but it's not great, and perhaps doesn't live up to its expectations. Undeniably, the music in the film is fantastic, and the soundtrack album is well worth buying. Clooney turns in a great performance in his first outing with the Brothers, and John Turturro, Holly Hunter, and John Goodman are great as well. Any fan of Homer or Sturges would be proud. However, the movie seems to fall short of what the viewer wants. It lacks the humor and the precise attention to complex and fascinating characters that we found in previous Coen Brothers films. The three bumbling escapees (Clooney, Turturro, and Tim Clarke Duncan) are the expected dim-witted good-hearted Southerners, and in the course of their odyssey to uncover the $1.2 million that Clooney stole and buried, meet a fanciful enough cast of weirdos.

The film is also very offensive at times. Every character seems to have a look of mental disability on his face. This is not funny, it's downright stupid and has no meaning. All the other Coen bros. films have meanings for their characters to have funny looks or funny faces but O Brother, Where Art Thou? does not explain anything whatsoever.

This is totally a totally gut-wrenching scene, all the audience - about 12 people where in the theatre - looked away from the screen, no laughs going on.

""The Big Lebowski"" was a comic tale with one million dollars at its center (in both cases that center included Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare).  ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", however, is different.  It begins with a search for one-point-TWO million dollars.""The Odyssey"" meets ""The Three Stooges"" meets Delta-blues-and-bluegrass meets Robert Altman's ""Thieves Like Us"", the latest Coen offerent almost defies conventional description.  Like ""Big Lebowski"", it's best viewed as a collection of anecdotes, and it doesn't really ends, so much as cuts to the closing credits at a logical breaking-off point.Three escaped convicts bumble around parched Mississip in 1937.  Their lead is played surprisingly well by George Clooney, who's covered in dirt, stubble, and Dapper Dan pomade from beginning to end.  John Turturro is rather muted, dropping out of the middle section entirely.  Tim Blake Nelson, playing the ""dumb"" one (similar to Steve Buscemi's role in ""Lebowski""), was previously unknown to me but stole nearly every scene he was in.  The movie's signature line belongs to him:  ""Oh, George, not the livestock!""The supporting roles are all Coen Brothers returnees: John Goodman, Holly Hunter, Charles Durning, and of course they steal all their scenes as well.  You'll never want for great acting in a Coen Brothers movie and this is one of their stronger casts.The DVD contains a couple of interesting features, and I say this without having watched the multi-angle storyboards.  The cinematography featurette is an eye-opener, pointing out details in the film's color scheme I would not have noticed on my own.  It's also so earnest that you'll be forgiven for thinking it's another Coen Brothers DVD-extra hoax a la the ""Blood Simple"" disc.

From the Cold recesses in the Midwest in &quot;Fargo,&quot; the bland suburbs of LA in &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; and the solitude of the deserts in &quot;Raising Arizona&quot;. Now The Coens have taken us into the heart of the Deep South in the 1930's in an imaginative and surrealistic telling of one of the original novels in the history of writing.Obviously it took the Coens a while to properly concieve Homer's &quot;Odyssey&quot; not only in a different setting but as a comedy which boasts a surprisingly piquant wit. Well they've managed to do it in an almost seamless manner. As you can see the Coens wasted no time in setting the scene. Opening with sweeping crane, and still shots of a chain gang singing their haunting melody. Then soon we jump to a montage of our heroes Ulysses Everett McGill, Pete Hogswallop, and Delmar O'Donnell, making a discreet yet clumsy escape from &quot;The Farm&quot; while incorporated with richly authentic, old-timey music. It shows us that these three men obviously have a long difficult path to follow. Then post-credits we are immediately supplied with a hilarious physical gag right out of the gate. Then soon we finally get the taste of the trio's personalities. spontaneously you see that Everett is a proud man who attempts to be intellectually inclined. Then you have Pete, who's highly rough-around-the-edges. The there's the clueless but good-hearted Delmar. Immediately they set up the characters likeability within the first five minutes with the sparkling dialogue. Which has become a staple in the Coen Brothers' illustrious careers.Aside from the films delightful surprises you get to see some of our favorite actors, new and old, playing charaters that go beyond unique. Probably the one most worth mentioning is George Clooney as Everett. The casting job couldn't have been more perfect(Clooney now has a Golden Globe to prove it). As you watch him boast and brag you see the constant look that states that he's so sure that he is right all the time.  When in reality the opposite is the truth. Next there's John Tuturro as Pete. His stance and his gruff tone display his harsh, rough upbrining. Which explains his tendency to lash out. finally there's Tim Blake Nelson (Director of &quot;O&quot;) and his performance as Delmar. Nelson's performance is dead-on target. even when he's handing George &quot;babyface&quot; Nelson his Tommy Gun, he still asks what George's profession is after George opens fire on the police giving chase then on helpless livestock. And you can see the childlike innocence on his face when he whimpers &quot;Oh, George, Not the Livestock.&quot;And even the otherwordly characters from the basis novel. make unique and symbolic appearances from the blind wandering prophet, the Cyclops (played to perfection by Coens Alumi John Goodman.), plus the standout scene of the three sirens singing seducing and sedating our three heroes. &quot;Those Sirens loved him up and turned him into a... Horny Toad!&quot;You gotta love the utter creativity and originality that was put into this film.

534343,A2TDK8D4HEMUYW,B00003CXRM,"John ""MovieAddict""","[3, 15]","I haven't seen many of the Coen Brothers' films, although one of the two I have seen is one of my favorites (&quot;Fargo&quot;), and the other I've seen is one I don't care for very much (&quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;). One of the films has a lot of humor, the other doesn't. One of the films is extremely entertaining; the other is just sort of boring.&quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; is a retelling of Homer's &quot;Odyssey,&quot; or &quot;Homer's Odyssey,&quot; since you never see the title without the name preceding it anymore; Homer's name is practically part of the title, now. Am I digressing?It starts with three runaway convicts, Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Pete (John Turturro), and Delmer (Tim Blake Nelson). Everett - as his chumps call him - has a strange fascination with his own hair, and Dapper Dan hair cream. &quot;I'm a Dapper Dan Man!&quot; he proclaims after being offered another brand of hair cream by a store clerk (who unfortunately doesn't carry Dapper Dan but looks as if he couldn't give a hoot either way). And, in another one of the film's few funny scenes, we see local police picking up a trail on the threesome after a bloodhound finds a tin can of Dapper Dan and a hairnet lying by a diminished fire.The trio has escaped from jail in hopes of finding an ancient treasure not delved into by the film so very much. Along the way they meet an odd assortment of characters, including a black guitarist who sold his soul to Satan so that he could learn to play guitar; a baby-faced criminal trying to make a name for himself; and a bulky thief (John Goodman) who steels what little fortunes the men have achieved by singing on the radio under the combined name of The Soggy Bottom Boys.Along the way they also encounter Everett's wife (Holly Hunter), who claims he was hit by a train, tells her seven children this, and refuses to acknowledge him as her husband. With the law in hot pursuit of them, the boys have only their brains to fall back on - and they don't have much of that available for use.The plot's not the problem with the film (per se). It has fun with itself; the bluegrass music is perfect for the film and makes you feel like you're in Mississippi. The problem is the way the film has a million different ideas going on that it never seems able to make sense of. The film takes spiritual detours that pay off at the end, but nothing is ever truly resolved. In one scene towards the overdue finale, Everett gets down on his knees and prays to God to deliver them from their doom. Suddenly a gigantic tidal wave roars through and demolishes their surroundings, leaving them alive and bobbing on the water's surface.I've read &quot;The Odyssey,&quot; but even with all its weirdness in mind I don't remember it being this weird. It's been a while, yes, but I don't remember a giant tidal wave and I certainly don't think it belongs in a feature film with enough wasted ideas. At least ""The Odyssey"" was weird for a reason - ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" could certainly do without the strangeness.Every time George Clooney is on-screen you'll be having some minimal amount of fun at least, but when he's gone and the film takes its time rooting through some unimportant sub-plots, it gets to be a real bore. It's not even two hours long but it feels like it's three.The plus side? Depression-era Mississippi comes alive, and in some scenes the dry filming makes you thirsty for a glass of cold water. Not only that, but just as in &quot;Fargo,&quot; the Coen Brothers are able to make us feel a sort of attachment to the characters - but even with Everett's funny infatuation with hair gel, he's not in the same league as Marge Gunderson, and he never will be.The first time I saw this movie in 2000 (the year of its release), I absolutely hated it. Back then, perhaps I was expecting something too close to &quot;Fargo.&quot; Maybe I just wanted something better. So with last night's repeat viewing, I made sure I wasn't expecting anything. I made sure I put away all pretensions. It still didn't impress me.&quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; does have some good parts, but for being a comedy it certainly doesn't have very many laughs, and for being a lightweight, uplifting drama it seems too caught up in darker ideas that don't need meddling with. And, apart from everything else, it's just plain weird. It's a whole lot different than &quot;Fargo,&quot; which might sound good since change is often welcomed from director(s). But whereas M. Night Shyamalan's &quot;Signs&quot; was different than &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; in a delightfully splendid way, &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; is sort of like George Lucas' latest installments into the extended &quot;Star Wars&quot; series. They may be different, but they're definitely not any better.",3,A far fall from &quot;Fargo&quot; for the Coen Brothers...,1070323200,"12 2, 2003",2003,4838,"['have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'many', 'Coen',

I was not a huge fan of this movie at first; it just didn't seem as funny to me as it was intended to be.  However, after watching &quot;Sullivan's Travels&quot; recently and re-watching &quot;O Brother&quot; (to save space, I'll leave out their connection; it can be found in other reviews on Amazon), it was MUCH funnier for me-&quot;Sullivan&quot; definitely put me in the right mind-set for this.

If you love bluegrass and folk music, you will not be dissatisfied with the supply in this movie.I also enjoyed the portrayal of human nature, especially in connection with Christianity. Although the salvation and subsequent baptism of two of the main characters was admittedly quite shallow, the foolishness and hypocrisy of the third character was clearly shown, as in the end he winds up praying for a miracle, receives it, and then attributes it to physical forces apart from God's control. This is certainly a foolish action by the character, but the Coen brothers expressed it as foolishness, for which I am grateful.There are drawbacks, however. Since the movie is based on Homer's epic, the Odyssey, the producers had to insert a scene with the famous Sirens. They are by the water in skimpy, wet clothing, and seduce the three men. I would recommend fast-forwarding through this part.

George Clooney is good as the calm, conniving leader of the escapees, and his dirty sidekicks are hilarious. John Goodman has a notable appearance as a smooth-talking cyclops, and the man who plays the governor (whose name alas eludes me) is absoloutely superb in his role as corrupt politician. The film is visually beautiful, shot entirely through some kind of yellow filter that gives it a bleached appearance that feels very appropriate both to the American south of the period in which it is set, and to the ancient Greek world of Homer's Odyssey on which the story is based. The old-timey music that the convicts perform (at one point they become a singing trio called &quot;The Soggy Bottom Boys!&quot;) is appealing as well. You will enjoy watching this odd and unpredicatble effort, but I must say that it is not perfect. I have a problem with the way the Odyssey parallels are handled. Simply put, they don't make much sense in the modern setting unless you know that they are meant to be from the Odyssey. There is no subtlety in the parallels, so that basically what we are given is the Odyssey set in 1930s Missippi, for no apparent reason. I wish they could have done a better job of making events ring true in the modern setting - so that if you watched the movie and didn't know the Odyssey, it would all still make some kind of sense, however odd. But this is not the case, and I feel disappointed, in that they could have made it into a truly great movie this way instead of merely an interesting and good one.

Palmer,"[3, 13]","Whenever I read a review of a movie written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, I invariably see the words &quot;original&quot; and &quot;quirky&quot; in the description of the film.  But after renting and watching &quot;Oh Brother, Where Art Thou&quot;, I am coming to the conclusion that &quot;original&quot; and &quot;quirky&quot; does not necessarily make a great film.I wanted to enjoy &quot;Oh Brother, Where Art Thou&quot; and I did think that the cinematography was excellent and the old-time songs were terrific, but this movie is harmed by too many long, drawn out scenes that do little to advance the plot.  I cite as examples the three convicts meeting the three women at the lake/river, the entire governor election subplot and the George &quot;Babyface&quot; Nelson sequence.  These scenes contain actors I enjoy watching (Charles Durning and Michael Badalucco from &quot;The Practice&quot;), but they do little to move the story along and I wondered if they were included just to make sure this movie was a reasonable length for a Coen movie (because without them, the movie would be about an hour long).I think that the three convicts (George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson) each have their moments, but there just isn't enough meat in the story to make their performances that interesting in general.  I will say that Clooney makes a great slimy character.The Coen brothers have become established enough that just about anything they do will garner praise from the critics.  In some movies, like &quot;Fargo&quot; and &quot;Raising Arizona&quot;, the praise is well-deserved, but in others, like &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; and &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy&quot;, it isn't.

I should say that my friends in the South don't mind any of this, but that's probably because they don't live with this kind of charicature of the South on a daily basis as I do.

Still, as is The Hudsucker Proxy, this film is whimsically amusing and highly stylized, though it probably will not be everyone's cup of tea. Fans of the Coen Brothers, however, will think that they have died and gone to heaven, when they see this film.The film takes place in Mississippi, the heart of the deep south, during the depression. Ulysses Everett McGill, charmingly played by George Clooney, who displays some real comedic talent, is a dapper dan of a fellow. Working on a chain gang, he escapes along with two other felons, disarmingly played by John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson. They are on their way to hunt up some buried treasure, the proceeds of a robbery, which McGill claims to know about. It later turns out that this was a mere ruse on the part of McGill, as he really had a different agenda.During their episodic odyssey, they encounter a motley crew of characters who brighten the cinematic landscape. The film also resonates with the sounds of blue grass and down home country music. The cinematography is wonderful, as it conveys the dustbowl feeling of the depression era, rural countryside. All in all, it makes for a pretty terrific, though highly unusual, film.

He is anxious to get off the chain gang so that he can retrieve his wealth, but long before the script can get to what it's about, it takes some absurdly inconsistent detours, one in a hick music recording studio, one in a KKK meeting (this part is actually disturbing), and one in a vintage movie theater...but if you're still interested in seeking the treasure by this time, then you don't understand what the Coen Brothers are doing here. And, in point of fact, I'm not sure that I want to. Religious beliefs, backwoods dialects, race, gender, and even talent are all parodied in a VERY insulting fashion here, all without the graphic and demonic violence that the Coen Brothers are usually all too happy to include in their efforts at telling narrative stories on screen--something they obviously have yet to perfect, in any case.Most of these performances are very silly, and I have no idea as to why this film became as popular as it did. Some of the music is okay, but not of the kind of best-selling, ""oh my gosh you must hear it"" variety. It is an unusually framed and colored movie, but you have to have a pretty strong mind to handle the assault upon basic intelligence that this film proffers. Another pile of hand-me-down hogwash from the Coen Brothers, who actually manage to offend fans of Preston Sturges along the route of their cinematic destruction course. If you are interested in gaining wisdom instead of jumping upon the bandwagon, read the write-up by the accredited university professor near the back of Ronald Bergan's published biography of Joel and Ethan (in which the professor derides these guys because he explains that ""the message is that there is no message""--he can help you to understand why the Coen Brothers and their films are utterly pointless). It will tell you all that you need to know about these intellectually dishonest moviemakers, and will hopefully set viewers upon the proper path of rejecting movies such as this one.

The synthesis of Depression-era Mississippi and Homeric Greece falls flat on its face; instead of intelligently incorporating the Odyssey's themes, the film blatantly steals scenes to no apparent effect. The siren scene, for example, is of no consequence to the film; our hereos get sucked in by their song and then....nothing. The scene with John Goodman, who turns in yet another memorable albeit brief role as the ""cyclops,"" also has no significance to the ""plot."" Rather it seems that the Coen brothers stole the form of the Odyssey but left the content behind, apparently for no other reason than to get people to see this vacuous movie.Speaking of getting people into the seats....George Clooney was hopelessly unconvincing as a smooth talking backwoodsman with pommaded hair. The film is full of largely unknown actors, most of whom do impressive jobs, and their anonymity adds to the believability of the movie. Yet Clooney stands out like a sore thumb in the dusty, gritty setting. His character is not even that likeable. For example, his whole reason for escaping was to reunite with his wife, with whom he has about as much spark as a jar of mayonnaise.A few redeeming qualities: the music is quite good, and Clooney's sidekicks give very good performances. But throughout the film, I was waiting for it to inspire me, to move me--hell, just make me laugh. It did none of this.

But the real key to the heart of this movie is the goof nature of the characters: just as Joel Cohen says in the production featurette included in the DVD, the funny trio are like the &quot;Three Stooges.&quot;This has been one clever movie all through which I was able to laugh very hard, and the funniest thing about it is that it's not a comedy at all. More like the struggles of this runaway trio you sympathize with from the very start, to find some treasure that Ulysees Everett McGill (played by Clooney) buried before going to prison. Through their adventures they face the sirens call, they oppose the cyclops (Big Dan Teague, played by John Goodman) and hit local musical stardom not knowing about it with the song &quot;Man of constant sorrow.&quot;The acting is very solid: Clooney, Turturro and Nelson all play great roles. The cinematography, by Roger Deakins (long time film companion of the Cohen brothers), is even more outstanding: it is the first time the entire post-production of a film is done digitally. The process used for doing this is explained in extensive detail in a very interesting featurette included in the DVD.Overall, deserving all the credit and the hype around it: it's an authentice masterpiece overall.

534405,A129YBX5BVNW2,B00003CXRM,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[2, 3]","*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2011 ALL-REGIONS BLU RAY REISSUE ***""Hot Damn! It's The Soggy Bottom Boys!""When the Coen Brothers unleashed ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" into cinemas in September 2000 - it was an audio and visual sensation. The DVD that followed in 2001 received equal praise. But little will prepare fans for this truly beautiful 2011 BLU RAY transfer - it's properly gorgeous to look at - and up there with the best this (often frustrating) format can offer...When it was originally filmed on location - a 'lossless' digital process was used to fully realise the specific light and scenery of Depression-hit Mississippi in 1937 (beautiful gold and yellow hues). That process combined with the stunning cinematography of Roger Deakins both get to shine like never before. There are times when the visuals are quite literally breathtaking in their clarity. And the canvas to impress your eyes just keeps coming at you as the movie progresses from location to location - open fields, hay barns, twisted swamps, dust roads, river banks, inside period cars and beat-up trucks, the chain-gang detail, radio stations and bank interiors. Even in the notoriously difficult indoor scenes in ramshackle homesteads and around campfires at night - it all looks 'so' good. Add to this a blisteringly funny script full of savvy life-observations and brutal local colloquialisms - and it's hardly surprising that it was nominated for 2 Academy Awards in these areas (Best Script and Cinematography).Defaulted to 2.35:1 aspect ratio - it has bars top and bottom of the screen - but even when stretched to full screen - it rarely loses any definition. And better news for fans around the world is that this issue is an 'ABC/All Regions' BLU RAY - so it will play on every machine (as well as PlayStation 3 consoles).Written and Directed by brothers Joel and Ethan Coen - ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" comes across as a sort of Three Stooges Road Movie with song accompaniment. Roughly based on Homer's Greek tragedy ""The Iliad"" about a journey of salvation with many ""ob-stack-les"" along the weary way - its genius soundtrack also sparked a worldwide interest in Blues, Gospel and Old Timey Country music - much of which had been long forgotten and often derided as hick and corny (2011 saw a 2CD 'Deluxe Edition' reissue of this). The film was immediately followed by the DVD release of the ""Down From The Mountain"" concert in Nashville, Tennessee featuring live music played by musicians on the Grammy-winning soundtrack. Anyone who has seen it will know that it's an equally joyful and musically charged experience. This is America before the sadness and loss of 9/11 - enjoying itself and celebrating its heritage - and rightly so.The large and varied cast is exceptional - especially the grotesque caricatures that pepper scene after scene. Quinn Gasaway as a gun-totting boy in filthy overalls, Stephen Root as the bug-eyed giggling recording studio boss, John Goodman as the dodgy Bible salesman Big Dan Teague whose ears pop up when he hears the crisp click of dollar bills in a restaurant. His eye-patch signals him as the club-wielding one-eyed Cyclops. Wayne Duvall as the hood-wearing racist Homer Stokes trying to get elected over Charles Durning - the portly but wily Governor of Mississippi - Pappy ""Pass The Biscuits"" O'Daniel who also hosts a radio show. So many great parts...The story goes something like this - chained together as a trio of escaped convicts - they are driven to find a $1.2 million dollar treasure Everett is supposed to have hidden in a shack in a valley that is to be flooded in five days time to build a massive hydro-electric dam. But they are being pursued by the Devil in sunglasses with his mean dog - Sheriff Cooley (played with relish by Daniel Von Bargen). After visiting a relative of Pete's called Wash (a man who rarely does) - the boys are hounded off the farm yet again. They then meet a Negro called Tommy Johnson at a crossroads and give him a lift (superbly played by Louisiana guitarist Chris Thomas King). He explains that at midnight the night before he sold his immortal soul to the Devil in return for a guitar that he ""sure can play"" (like the folklore surrounding Blues legend Robert Johnson). Delmar is appalled but Everett sees a business opportunity. If they can get to a radio station on the outskirts of the State - there's a man there who'll give them money to ""sing into a can"". They eventually get there - pretend to be The Soggy Bottom Boys - do a charged rendition of ""I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow"" - and cut a record. But unbeknown to the hapless crew - a radio hit is born that will literally save their souls (and lives) in the end. But before they can get to that redemption of sorts - all sorts of journey hilarity ensues - including a reunion between Everett and his estranged wife Penny (Holly Hunter) and their 4-strong progeny of mouthy daughters. There are gun-battles with a madcap bank robber George 'Baby Face' Nelson who shoots livestock because he hates cows (a fantastic turn by Coens' favourite Michael Badalucco) and sexy Sirens by the river who turn Pete into a horny toad. It all ends with tins of Dapper Dan pomade floating by the screen when the big flood comes (along with everything else)...The music deserves a special mention. While audiences expected to howl with laughter and cringe at the array of unhygienic ingrates displayed on screen - what they hadn't expected was to be so moved by the old-timey music - full of ballads about heartbreak, poverty and death. A perfect example is The Cox Family singing ""I Am Weary (Give Me Rest)"" on a truck at a town gathering - the melody and lyrics are genuinely moving. The congregation making their way through the trees to the river to be baptised as they sing (Acapella) ""Down To The River To Pray"". Country and Blues musicians also have on-and-off-camera cameos - Clooney lip-synching in the recording booth is really being sung by Dan Tyminski of Alison Krauss' band Union Station - Gillian Welch asking for a copy of the song in a record shop - Alison Krauss, Gillian Welch and Emmylou Harris provide the Acapella vocals as the seductive Sirens on the river - Ralph Stanley of The Stanley Brothers singing ""O Death"" as Tommy is led by a lynch mob to a gallows and a burning cross - The Fairfield Four Gospel group singing as they dig graves by a log cabin...But the movie belongs to the three principal leads - John Turturro as the permanently moaning Pete Hogwallop and Tim Blake Nelson as the less than Mensa-material Delmar O'Donnell (a role he would revive to great effect in ""Flypaper"" - see review). There is a rare and completely believable chemistry between them. But the big revelation here is George Clooney playing the philosophy-jabbering Everett Ulysses McGill. While he doesn't quite reach the cult-inducing peaks of Jeff Bridges as 'The Dude' in the Coens incomparable ""The Big Lebowski"" (a part emblazoned into cinema lover's hearts forever) - Clooney shows a deftness of touch for comedy and pathos throughout that is quite fantastic. More importantly he seemed to finally park his devastatingly handsome good looks by taking a career chance and showing the world that he was more than just a pretty face. Clooney can act his soggy pants off if given the right part (something he's proved many times since).The only real let down is the paltry extras (those that accompanied the initial DVD issue) which last only a few minutes and leave you craving more.Still - this is a fantastic advertisement for what BLU RAY can offer. I only wish I had a humungous home-cinema system to watch it on.To sum up - after they fail to catch a passing train full of men with ""aimless lives of wandering..."" Delmar is asked by the other two squabblers to give the deciding vote on who is leader of the trio. Delmar sappily says - ""I'm with you fellas!""I wholeheartedly agree.BLU RAY Specifications:VIDEO: 1080p High Definition - Aspect Radio 2.35:1AUDIO: English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and Spanish 2.0 Dolby DigitalSUBTITLES: English SDH (Hard Of Hearing), French and SpanishEXTRAS:1.

I had no idea what to expect when I saw this movie while waiting to meet someone at a mall, but I was entranced.  I found it touching, funny, and thought-provoking all at the same time.The only drawback was that sometimes the dialogue was unintelligible - kind of the aural equivalent of all of those scenes where it's so dark that you can't see what is happening. Now I realize that making the movie-goer uncomfortable and sit forward in his seat may have a role in a suspense movie, but there is no role for this kind of manipulation in a movie that is supposed to be entertaining.Nevertheless, I bought this movie the first day it was out - I even pre-ordered it.

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[6, 6]","Joel and Ethan Coen seem incapable of making a film that isn't at least interesting, and often their movies are absolutely delightful.  I think everyone has their favorites (mine are &quot;Fargo&quot; and &quot;Raising Arizona&quot;), but this film touched a few cultural nerves that are infrequently accessed.For one thing, the soundtrack features a brilliant collection of grass-roots and Americana music - acoustic blues and jazz and bluegrass.  Alison Krauss, already a novelty around Nashville as a platinum-selling bluegrass artist, received a thunderbolt of a boost to her career by supplying several tunes and vocal parts to the soundtrack (for example singing the Heavenly &quot;Down to the River to Pray&quot; during the baptism scene and the seductive voice of one of the sirens later on).  Dan Tyminski, one of the musicians from Alison's band, Union Station, supplies the singing voice of George Clooney and Dan Tyminski's &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; became even MORE of a novelty around Nashville as it won one Country Music Award after another without the benefit of any significant radio play.The script is VERY loosely based on Homer's Odyssey and knowing that allows the moderately educated a few hearty chuckles recognizing, for example, that John Goodman's Eye-Patched Bible Salesman represents the Cyclops.George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson deliver the Coen's rib-tickling dialogue with gusto.  I don't know why it's so entertaining to watch characters who are clueless, or at least more clueless than they think they are, but to see three bravura performances as chain-gang refugee dunces is a treat here.In a typical early sequence our trio has just made their break from the chain-gang and Clooney's Everett begins taking charge.  Turturro's Pete questions him:&quot;Wait a minute.  Who elected you leader of this outfit?&quot;Everette responds &quot;Well, Pete, I figured it should be the one with the capacity for abstract thought.  But if that ain't the consensus, then hell, let's put it to a vote.&quot;&quot;Suits me&quot;, says Pete. &quot;I'm voting for yours truly.&quot;&quot;Well, I'm voting for yours truly too&quot; replies Everett, not backing down.Pete and Everett turn to their slightly denser partner Delmar to break the deadlocked vote.He ponders it thoughtfully.&quot;Okay....

Following their tales of the upper Midwest (Fargo) and a bowler from LA (The Big Lebowski) comes a take on Homer's Odyssey in the dirty 30s. George Clooney stars as our traveling hero Ulysses Everett McGill a man obsessed with his image and his special hair treatment.McGill convinces his jail buddies Pete (John Turturro) and Delmer (Tim Black Nelson) to escape alongside him with promise of a million dollar treasure awaiting them at the end of the trip. The trip really is all about him trying to re-unite with his wife in time before she gets remarried. Right away they run into a prophetic blind man on a railroad cart who warns them of their fate and then the standard Coen craziness begins.Among the things our trio of runaways encounters are one-eyed bulky bible salesman, 3 sirens who seduce them, the Klan, and a manic depressive bank robber amongst other things. Joining them off and on through their journey is Tommy, a black man who tells them he sold his soul to the devil so he could play the guitar, which does come in handy when the pop into a recording studio and make some easy money singing what becomes a smash hit for the movie world and in reality with ""Man of Constant Sorrow"".I will admit to having to see this film 3 or 4 times before it really clicked with me, but Coen fans in the end will absolutely adore this picture.

534416,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXRM,Matthew Horner,"[0, 1]","Joel and Ethan Cohen, two brothers from the Midwest, have been making quirky, flamboyant movies for two decades. They have created some delightful films, including Blood Simple, Raising Arizona and Fargo. O Brother, Where Art Thou? isn't one of their best efforts. It has some great scenes and superb acting, but the whole thing never quite adds up to a satisfactory whole. Still, even a minor Cohen movie ranks above the Hollywood average.The movie is based loosely - very loosely! - on Homer's epic Greek poem, The Odyssey. It takes place in the Mississippi Delta during the Great Depression of the 1930s. When it opens, Ulysses, Pete and Delmar [George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson] are escaping from a chain gang, and they spend most of the rest of the movie running from the law. Ulysses talks the other into escaping by claiming he buried the loot from a big robbery. They have to get to it quickly, he says, because the place where he buried it is about to be flooded for the creation of a lake. Their madcap adventures cause them to meet many strange, eccentric characters. There is the blind man who endlessly rides the rails and foretells the futures of those he meets. They meet the Bible salesman from hell, enthusiastically played by John Goodman, as well as three sirens who set out to seduce and rob them, a black blues musician who has just sold his soul the Devil at the crossroads, and Ulysses' wacky wife and daughters. They find some interesting discoveries, as well as some ugly surprises.As is typical of a Cohen brothers film, this one is fast-paced and rarely gives the audience time to think about what it has just seen. The movie is more a series of vignettes than it is a well structured story. Scenes that work are both hilarious and impressive, but the problem is that others fall flat. Also, the ending is uninspired, as if the team were unable to come up with a suitable punch line to their tale.Most of the actors here have worked with the Cohens before, which allows them to be quite comfortable in their roles. Tim Blake Nelson, as dimwitted Delmar, and Holly Hunter, as Ulysses' wife, are standout. This is George Clooney's first picture with this group, but he has no trouble fitting in. He is very good and very funny. In fact, in the last five years he has become one of my favorite actors.",3,Playful Coen brothers romp is a bit uneven,1016150400,"03 15, 2002",2002,2343,"['Joel', 'Ethan', 'Cohen', 'two', 'brothers', 'Midwest', 'have', 'been', 'making', 'quirky', 'flamboyant', 'movies', 'two', 'decades', 'have', 'created', 'delightful', 'films', 'including', 'Blood', 'Simple', 'Raising', 'Arizona', 'Fargo', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', ""n't"", 'one', 'best', 'efforts', 'great', 'scenes', 'superb', 'acting', 'whole', 'thing', 'never', 'quite', 'up', 'satisfactory', 'whole', 'Still', 'even', 'minor', 'Cohen', 'movie', 'ranks', 'Hollywood', 'average.The', 'movie', 'based', 'loosely', 'very', 'loosely', 'Homer', 'epic', 'Greek', 'poem', 'Odyssey', 'place', 'Mississippi', 'Delta', 'Great', 'Depression', '1930s', 'When', 'Ulysses', 'Pete', 'Delmar', '[', 'George', 'Clooney', 'John', 'Turturro', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', ']', 'are', 'escaping', 'chain', 'gang', 'spend', 'most', 'rest', 'movie', 'running', 'law', 'talks', 'other', 'escaping', 'claiming', 'buried', 'loot', 'big', 'robbery', 'have', 'get', 'quickly', 'place', 'where', 'buried', 'be', 'flooded', 'creation', 'lake', 'madcap', 'adventures', 'cause', 'meet', 'many', 'strange', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'blind', 'man', 'who', 'endlessly', 'rails', 'futures', 'meet', 'Bible', 'salesman', 'hell', 'enthusiastically', 'played', 'John', 'Goodman', 'as', 'well', 'three', 'sirens', 'who', 'set', 'out', 'seduce', 'rob', 'black', 'blues', 'musician', 'who', 'just', 'sold', 'soul', 'Devil', 'crossroads', 'Ulysses', 'wacky', 'wife', 'daughters', 'find', 'interesting', 'discoveries', 'as', 'well', 'ugly', 'surprises.As', 'typical', 'Cohen', 'brothers', 'film', 'one', 'fast-paced', 'rarely', 'audience', 'time', 'think', 'what', 'just', 'seen', 'movie', 'more', 'series', 'vignettes', 'well', 'structured', 'story', 'Scenes', 'work', 'are', 'hilarious', 'impressive', 'problem', 'others', 'fall', 'flat', 'Also', 'ending', 'uninspired', 'team', 'were', 'unable', 'come', 'up', 'suitable', 'punch', 'line', 'tale.Most', 'actors', 'here', 'have', 'worked', 'Cohens', 'be', 'quite', 'comfortable', 'roles', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'dimwitted', 'Delmar', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'Ulysses', 'wife', 'are', 'standout', 'George', 'Clooney', 'first', 'picture', 'group', 'trouble', 'fitting', 'very', 'good', 'very', 'funny', 'fact', 'last', 'five', 'years', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors']","O Brother, Where Art Thou?"

It left me entertained and was very inventive and original, like most Coen brothers films. However, a rental might be the ideal way to go before buying to get a taste of the film or else it may leave a little to be desired. Those expecting &quot;Fargo 2&quot; just because this is by the Coens should go elsewhere.Purportedly based on The Odyssey, the film can be enjoyed without any prior knowledge of that book. There are plenty of moments where the film left me confused, but you tend to overlook these things in a film like this. It can be enjoyed on two levels: as a story about 3 chain-gang escapees and there adventures, or as that coupled with the symbolic references to The Odyssey. Though some of the references aren't too difficult to associate with some basic knowledge of that work (the sirens, the cyclops), it would be pretty neat to have read the book and deduce the references to it.The actors give good performances, although the characters are somewhat overshadowe by the humorous southern accents and odd situations they're put in. My main problems with the film is its characters as they don't seem to have much depth, especially John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson's characters. The main characters seem only to serve as mechanisms to further the plot by getting into sticky situations and then getting out of them again. Not a problem in a comedy, but I don't know if you can say this film fits completely under the comedy genre.The DVD is pretty well done. The Painting with Pixels extra discusses how the filmmakers achieved the film's dry, burnt coloration and it's pretty cool; the look of the film is fabulous and really takes you to the Depression-era.  Also, the multi-angle feature comparing the film to its storyboards is well done (although your standard storyboard comparison), and the music video &quot;I'm a Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; is a good addition as well.I only gave this film 3 stars because I can't justify giving it a better rating (maybe 3 1/2).

It was interesting.Don't get me wrong, I thought this was a pretty clever comedy for the most part.  Clooney and two other prisoners have escaped and are looking for buried treasure.  Along the way, they run into some very interesting characters and unpredictable situations at every corner.

George Clooney also does a superb job, and in fact, we even get to hear him sing.This was a clever comedy, but I felt that some parts were a little slow and hard to understand.  Some parts were more confusing than funny.  It's just not your typical Coen film, and maybe I expected a little more.Maybe this is one of those movies you have to see a second time to fully appreciate it for what it stands for.  There is some outstanding acting and twists along the way, and there are plenty of laughs for everyone to enjoy.  You may want to get familar with some of the &quot;Oddesy&quot; before you see this movie.  My advice, rent it first before buying it.  It's an odd comedy that isn't for everyone.

Starring George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Turturro,  it features a brilliantly written script, superb acting by a wonderful ensemble cast, and a musical score that's simply second to none.&quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; is a simple story really... set in the Mississippi delta region during the Great Depression, it's the tale of three petty criminals who escape from the chain gang in quest of buried treasure and experience a series of misadventures along the way.  Ulysses Everett McGill (Clooney) is the silver-tongued, self-appointed leader of this odd trio, a man who claims to have stolen and buried over a million dollars in cash.  Delmar O'Donnell is the docile, sweet-tempered dimwit (played to perfection by Tim Blake Nelson).  The third member of our little gang is an irritable, acerbic fella named  Pete.  Together they set off, chained to each other, in search of McGill's treasure, which is buried somewhere about to become a man-made lake.  Our heroes have only four days to find the loot before it's lost forever at the bottom of the newly created reservoir.As they begin their journey, the run across an old blind seer who prophesies that they  will find a fortune, but not the one they seek. with a posse of law enforcement officers and vigilantes hot on their heels, Everett, Pete and Delmar ditch their chains and prison garb and continue on their quest.Our trio's journey is anything but quiet and uneventful.  They continually run into strange people and situations... At one point, soon after stealing a car and picking up a guitar-playing hitch-hiker, they stop at a local radio station and, posing as an &quot;old-timey&quot; music group called the &quot;Soggy Bottom Boys,&quot; they cut a record that's soon all the rage throughout the region.  Later they encounter a Baptist congregation at river's edge, singing a beautiful song, lulling our heroes into sweet forgetfulness for a few brief moments.  They happen upon three washer-women, also at river's edge, whose siren-like song ensnares our three miscreants... George Nelson, a bank robber on the run, who nearly co-opts our heroes into a REAL life of crime...  the one-eyed, fast-talking Bible salesman Dan Teague (played by John Goodman) who offers Everett, Pete, and Delmar a hard lesson on economics and life in general in the Depression-ravaged Deep South...  and other characters as well:  Governor  Pappy &quot;Pass the Biscuits&quot; O'Daniel, running for re-election against a reform-minded candidate named Homer Stokes... Everett's ex-wife Penny, soon to me re-married to a real drone named Vernon Waldrip... and a whole gang of fellas dressed in white sheets and hoods who take exception to our heroes' intrusion into their ceremonies.One of &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou's?&quot; greatest strengths is its musical score.  As the Coen brothers point out, nary a scene goes by without some kind of music in the background.  The songs - 19 of them by my count - are  all wonderful.  It's a sublime mixture of old-time gospel and country music and African-American spirituals.  From James Carter and the Prisoners' &quot;Po' Lazarus,&quot; through Alison Krause's sweetly  simple and reverent &quot;Down to the River to Pray&quot; (with brilliant harmonies added by the First Baptist Choir of White House, Tennessee);  the old-time country classics &quot;I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; and &quot;Hard Rock Candy Mountain,&quot; and &quot;You Are My Sunshine;&quot; to the old-time Gospel classics &quot;Keep On the Sunny Side;&quot; &quot;I'll Fly Away&quot; and &quot;I Am Weary (Let Me Rest),&quot; (and many other songs as well), the music adds an extra dimension to this already multi-faceted film.  (By the way, all these songs can be found on the &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; soundtrack compact disc... but that's another review!)I've now watched &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; about  a dozen times.  Each viewing has been a genuine pleasure for me. This film is clever in its conception, extraordinary in its execution, sublime in its storytelling, and masterful in its music.  In short... wonderfully entertaining in every respect.  A definite &quot;must-see&quot; for movie-lovers everywhere!",5,Homer meets The Three Stooges in the Mississippi Delta!,1016236800,"03 16, 2002",2002,4512,"['Alright', 'folks', 'here', 'riddle', 'day', 'Whaddaya', 'get', 'cross', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Greek', 'poet', 'Homer', 'quot', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', 'quot', 'what', 'Here', 'superb', 'comedy', 'finely', 'crafted', 'screenwriters', '/producers/', 'directors', 'Joel', 'Ethan', 'Coen', 'Starring', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'John', 'Turturro', 'brilliantly', 'written', 'script', 'superb', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'musical', 'score', 'simply', 'second', 'none.', 'quot', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', 'quot', 'simple', 'story', 'really', 'set', 'Mississippi', 'delta', 'region', 'Great', 'Depression', 'tale', 'three', 'petty', 'criminals', 'who', 'escape', 'chain', 'gang', 'quest', 'buried', 'treasure', 'experience', 'series', 'misadventures', 'way', 'Everett', 'McGill', 'Clooney', 'silver-tongued', 'self-appointed', 'leader', 'odd', 'trio', 'man', 'who', 'have', 'stolen', 'buried', 'million', 'dollars', 'cash', 'Delmar', ""O'Donnell"", 'docile', 'sweet-tempered', 'dimwit', 'played', 'perfection', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'third', 'member', 'little', 'gang', 'irritable', 'acerbic', 'fella', 'named', 'Pete', 'Together', 'set', 'off', 'chained', 'other', 'search', 'McGill', 'treasure', 'buried', 'somewhere', 'become', 'man-made', 'lake', 'heroes', 'have', 'only', 'four', 'days', 'find', 'loot', 'lost', 'forever', 'bottom', 'newly', 'created', 'reservoir.As', 'begin', 'journey', 'run', 'old', 'blind', 'seer', 'who', 'will', 'find', 'fortune', 'not', 'one', 'seek', 'posse', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officers', 'vigilantes', 'hot', 'heels', 'Everett', 'Pete', 'Delmar', 'ditch', 'chains', 'prison', 'garb', 'continue', 'quest.Our', 'trio', 'journey', 'anything', 'quiet', 'uneventful', 'continually', 'run', 'strange', 'people', 'situations', 'one', 'point', 'soon', 'stealing', 'car', 'picking', 'up', 'guitar-playing', 'hitch-hiker', 'stop', 'local', 'radio', 'station', 'posing', 'quot', 'old-timey', 'quot', 'music', 'group', 'called', 'quot', 'Soggy', 'Bottom', 'Boys', 'quot', 'cut', 'record', 'soon', 'rage', 'region', 'Later', 'encounter', 'Baptist', 'congregation', 'river', 'edge', 'singing', 'beautiful', 'song', 'lulling', 'heroes', 'sweet', 'forgetfulness', 'few', 'brief', 'moments', 'happen', 'three', 'washer-women', 'also', 'river', 'edge', 'siren-like', 'song', 'three', 'miscreants', 'George', 'Nelson', 'bank', 'robber', 'run', 'who', 'nearly', 'co-opts', 'heroes', 'REAL', 'life', 'crime', 'one-eyed', 'fast-talking', 'Bible', 'salesman', 'Dan', 'Teague', 'played', 'John', 'Goodman', 'who', 'Everett', 'Pete', 'Delmar', 'hard', 'lesson', 'economics', 'life', 'general', 'Depression-ravaged', 'Deep', 'South', 'other', 'characters', 'well', 'Governor', 'Pappy', 'quot', 'Pass', 'Biscuits', 'quot', ""O'Daniel"", 'running', 're-election', 'reform-minded', 'candidate', 'named', 'Homer', 'Stokes', 'Everett', 'ex-wife', 'Penny', 'soon', 're-married', 'real', 'drone', 'named', 'Vernon', 'Waldrip', 'whole', 'gang', 'fellas', 'dressed', 'white', 'sheets', 'hoods', 'who', 'take', 'exception', 'heroes', 'intrusion', 'ceremonies.One', 'quot', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', 'quot', 'greatest', 'strengths', 'musical', 'score', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'point', 'out', 'nary', 'scene', 'kind', 'music', 'background', 'songs', '19', 'count', 'are', 'wonderful', 'sublime', 'mixture', 'old-time', 'gospel', 'country', 'music', 'African-American', 'spirituals', 'James', 'Carter', 'Prisoners', 'quot', 'Po', 'Lazarus', 'quot', 'Alison', 'Krause', 'sweetly', 'simple', 'reverent', 'quot', 'Down', 'River', 'Pray', 'quot', 'brilliant', 'harmonies', 'added', 'First', 'Baptist', 'Choir', 'White', 'House', 'Tennessee', 'old-time', 'country', 'classics', 'quot', 'Am', 'Man', 'Constant', 'Sorrow', 'quot', 'quot', 'Hard', 'Rock', 'Candy', 'Mountain', 'quot', 'quot', 'Are', 'My', 'Sunshine', 'quot', 'old-time', 'Gospel', 'classics', 'quot', 'Keep', 'Sunny', 'Side', 'quot', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'Fly', 'Away', 'quot', 'quot', 'Am', 'Weary', 'Let', 'Me', 'Rest', 'quot', 'many', 'other', 'songs', 'well', 'music', 'extra', 'dimension', 'already', 'multi-faceted', 'film', 'way', 'songs', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'quot', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', 'quot', 'compact', 'disc', 'review', ""'ve"", 'now', 'watched', 'quot', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', 'quot', 'dozen', 'times', 'viewing', 'been', 'genuine', 'pleasure', 'film', 'clever', 'conception', 'extraordinary', 'execution', 'sublime', 'storytelling', 'masterful', 'music', 'short', 'wonderfully', 'entertaining', 'respect', 'A', 'definite', 'quot', 'must-see', 'quot', 'movie-lovers', 'everywhere']","O Brother, Where Art Thou?"
534437,A27PSZX2SE0B51,B00003CXRM,Mike Stone,"[8, 8]","""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" does a fine job building up a reservoir of good faith.  From the first shot of Our Heroes emerging from the wheat field, to Clooney's curious predilection for a certain brand of pomade, to the lovably sweet mug of Tim Blake Nelson, you just know that a rocking good time is going to be had by all.  That's what I mean by good faith.  And it's a good thing it works so hard at building it up, because it nearly runs out of it in the end.  Luckily, the closing credits pop up just in time.Not being expertly familiar with ""The Odyssey"" (my English degree hides its eyes in shame), I only got the most obvious of the movie's Ulyssean references (e.g., Clooney's name; an eyepatched John Goodman as the Cyclops; the Sirens).  Don't think it mattered much, though.  It does help if you look at the story as something mythic rather than something realistic.  Suspend that disbelief, and you shall reap entertainment.The Coen's pay a lot of attention to making the land being traversed optimal for this particular quest.  The terrain flows from arid squalor to lush greenery, from the isolatedly rural to the hecticly urban, and the cinematography is apropos in each setting.  It's also quite gorgeous.  It's not as cartoonish as, say, ""Raising Arizona"", but the Coen's sure know how to frame a comedic shot and sequence.George Clooney, as the loquacious leader, is miles away from anything else he's done.  I've heard it time and time again that he is a one-note actor, given to hanging his head in a grating, sheepdoggish manner (I call this the `Doug Ross Tilt'), hoping for your forgiveness but not really sorry.  Well, he does none of that here.  Instead, he bugs out his eyes, messes up his hair, and screams like a little girl.  It's a great comedic performance.  He's ably backed up by Coen regular John Turturro, who appears to be a ragged collection of arms and legs and teeth, and Tim Blake Nelson.  I was surprised to learn that Nelson is also a playwright, screenwriter, and director.  Surprised because his Delmar is ""dumber than a bag of hammers"", but blessed with so much pure folksy wisdom that you just fall in love with him.  There are some moments when he is caught with just the most blissful look on his face.  They say more than any dialogue ever could.  Bless the Coen's heart for letting them do just that.  Also on hand here filling out the minor roles are Coen veterans John Goodman (a big and blustery bible salesman) and Holly Hunter (as Clooney's [ex-]wife), as well as prodigious scenery chewer Charles Durning (as the incumbent governor of Mississippi) and the underrated Stephen Root (as a blind recording engineer).Helping to flesh out the movie is a soundtrack packed with and abundance of ""good-timey"" country-bluegrass classics.  Tops amongst them are Clooney and the boys joined by a Robert Johnson-like guitar player (they pick him up at the crossroads, natch), recording a song as `the Soggy Bottom Boys'.  Their song is supposed to become a huge hit in the narrative, and it's such a joyous number that I can truly see that happening.  And watching them perform it live (twice!) is such a treat, especially since Blake and Turturro do perform some wonderfully ludicrous dance moves.There's so much here that's just plain energetic and ridiculous, you're bound to fall in love with it.",5,Amusing Odyssey of the Soggy Bottom Boys,991094400,"05 29, 2001",2001,3346,"['O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', 'fine', 'job', 'building', 'up', 'reservoir', 'good', 'faith', 'first', 'shot', 'Heroes', 'emerging', 'wheat', 'field', 'Clooney', 'curious', 'predilection', 'certain', 'brand', 'pomade', 'lovably', 'sweet', 'mug', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'just', 'know', 'rocking', 'good', 'time', 'going', 'be', 'had', 'what', 'mean', 'good', 'faith', 'good', 'thing', 'so', 'hard', 'building', 'up', 'nearly', 'end', 'Luckily', 'closing', 'credits', 'pop', 'up', 'just', 'time.Not', 'being', 'expertly', 'familiar', 'Odyssey', 'English', 'degree', 'eyes', 'shame', 'only', 'got', 'most', 'obvious', 'movie', 'Ulyssean', 'references', 'e.g.', 'Clooney', 'name', 'eyepatched', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Cyclops', 'Sirens', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'mattered', 'much', 'help', 'look', 'story', 'something', 'rather', 'something', 'realistic', 'Suspend', 'disbelief', 'shall', 'reap', 'entertainment.The', 'Coen', 'pay', 'lot', 'attention', 'making', 'land', 'being', 'traversed', 'optimal', 'particular', 'quest', 'terrain', 'arid', 'squalor', 'lush', 'greenery', 'isolatedly', 'rural', 'hecticly', 'urban', 'cinematography', 'apropos', 'setting', 'also', 'quite', 'gorgeous', 'not', 'as', 'cartoonish', 'say', 'Raising', 'Arizona', 'Coen', 'sure', 'know', 'how', 'frame', 'comedic', 'shot', 'sequence.George', 'Clooney', 'loquacious', 'leader', 'miles', 'away', 'anything', 'else', 'done', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'one-note', 'actor', 'given', 'hanging', 'head', 'grating', 'sheepdoggish', 'manner', 'call', 'Doug', 'Ross', 'Tilt', 'hoping', 'forgiveness', 'not', 'really', 'sorry', 'Well', 'none', 'here', 'Instead', 'out', 'eyes', 'up', 'hair', 'screams', 'little', 'girl', 'great', 'comedic', 'performance', 'ably', 'backed', 'up', 'Coen', 'regular', 'John', 'Turturro', 'who', 'be', 'ragged', 'collection', 'arms', 'legs', 'teeth', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'was', 'surprised', 'learn', 'Nelson', 'also', 'playwright', 'screenwriter', 'director', 'Surprised', 'Delmar', 'dumber', 'bag', 'hammers', 'blessed', 'so', 'much', 'pure', 'folksy', 'wisdom', 'just', 'fall', 'love', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'caught', 'just', 'most', 'blissful', 'look', 'face', 'say', 'more', 'dialogue', 'ever', 'could', 'Bless', 'Coen', 'heart', 'letting', 'do', 'just', 'Also', 'hand', 'here', 'filling', 'out', 'minor', 'roles', 'are', 'Coen', 'veterans', 'John', 'Goodman', 'big', 'blustery', 'bible', 'salesman', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'Clooney', '[', 'ex-', ']', 'wife', 'as', 'well', 'prodigious', 'scenery', 'chewer', 'Charles', 'Durning', 'incumbent', 'governor', 'Mississippi', 'underrated', 'Stephen', 'Root', 'blind', 'recording', 'engineer', '.Helping', 'flesh', 'out', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'packed', 'abundance', 'good-timey', 'country-bluegrass', 'classics', 'Tops', 'are', 'Clooney', 'boys', 'joined', 'Robert', 'Johnson-like', 'guitar', 'player', 'pick', 'up', 'crossroads', 'natch', 'recording', 'song', 'Soggy', 'Bottom', 'Boys', 'song', 'supposed', 'become', 'huge', 'hit', 'narrative', 'such', 'joyous', 'number', 'can', 'truly', 'see', 'happening', 'watching', 'perform', 'live', 'twice', 'such', 'treat', 'especially', 'Blake', 'Turturro', 'do', 'perform', 'wonderfully', 'ludicrous', 'dance', 'so', 'much', 'here', 'just', 'plain', 'energetic', 'ridiculous', ""'re"", 'bound', 'fall', 'love']","O Brother, Where Art Thou?"
534438,A3UVGHUDOY77YR,B00003CXRM,MissPammy,"[0, 0]","This was a really entertaining movie with an old-time flavor.  The antics of John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson as George Clooney's sidekicks were hilarious, and Clooney's role was central.  I loved their rendition of &#34;I am a man of constant sorrow&#34; which was voiced by a real country singer and his group, and the outrageous hillbilly dancing.  As cute as the movie was, be advised that there was some fairly brutal violence in it that you would not want children to see.  I would characterize this movie as an adventure film that involves a journey.  The three men escape from prison and go through a number of escapades and dilemmas as they meet a sequence of people along the way, some of whom end up being very significant to them in one way or another even though at first glance they don't seem so.  At the same time, Clooney's character goes on an inner journey in which he evolves as a man and outgrows some of his wayward tendencies--although not his vanity, as the constant reminders of his favorite hair pomade, Dapper Dan, show.  The photographic work was exceptionally good.  Throughout, the camera provides that old-time feel, probably through the use of filters, and the filming of the flood scene was amazing.  I would recommend this movie highly for adults.

However, he is still shackled to his two chain-mates from the chain gang - the bad tempered Pete ( John Turturo)and the sweet and dimwitted Delmar ( Tim Blake Nelson). With nothing else to lose, the trio sets off in search of buried treasure that will help them all start new lives. Everett claims that he stole and buried over one million dollars in cash. The only problem is that they only have four days to find it before it is lost forever at the bottom of a reservoir. But as luck would have it, they keep running into strange situations, and even stranger people. The trio steals a car, and eventually pick up a guitar playing hitchiker. To make some extra money, they stop at a radio station and pose as a music group called &quot;The Soggy Bottom Boys&quot;. The record that they cut soon becomes the hottest record in the reigon. However, the adventure does not stop there, as they encounter many more strange characters that include : a blind prophet, a bank robber ( Michael Badalucco), a crooked one-eyed bible salesman ( John Goodman), and Everet's ex-wife ( Holly Hunter)who is about to get re-married. This crazy adventure filled with close calls, near misses, and betrayals will have you laughing every step of the way.Oh man, what an oustanding film. This film succeeds on so many levels. The first is the story itself. Watching the three run into one thing after the next will keep you entertained for the entire film. Next, is the amazing cast. George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Turturo are all spectacular in their roles. All three are extremely different, but will make you laugh the same. The supporting cast is quite good as well as features performances by Holly Hunter, Michael Badalucco, John Goodman, and Charles Durning. But perhaps the best thing about the film is the amazing soundtrack. It features a wide variety of different artists and each song is spectacular. Dan Tyminksi provides the singing voice for George Clooney on &quot;I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow&quot;. This is the Soggy Bottom Boys song that serves as a template for the bluegrass laden soundtrack that also features : Alison Krauss, Ralph Stanley, The Whites, John Hartford, The Cox Family and Gillian Welch.The acting is spectacular, the music is amazing, the story is extremely well rounded, and it is down right hillarious. The DVD is outstanding. You not only get great picture and sound quality, but outstanding extras as well.

They are one of the most original and wickedly funny filmmaking teams to come along in some time. I've seen just about all of their movies, but of all their great films, I think this has to be my absolute favorite. I didn't go see this in the theater, because I had read some negative reviews of it, but when this came on video, my cousin who works in a video store told that it was hilarious.So one night while his wife was working third-shift, he brought it home and I came over, we ordered a pizza, cracked a few brews, and watched this movie. Let me say that I don't know if I've EVER laughed so hard in my life. It's just a fun thing to watch and listen to.  So many great one-liners and oddball humor, the dialect, the ridiculous situations, the way Clooney sends up his own dapper image, as well as his hopeless attempts to lead the trio.  I just can't get enough of this, fa'real.  They play a group of escaped convicts who are determined to find some buried treasure that Ulysseus CLAIMS he knows where is.  The film is loosely based on Homer's 'The Odyssey', but that doesn't mean you won't enjoy the movie unless you're familiar with the book. I haven't read it since like the 9th grade, so I'm a little dusty on picking up all the references myself, but I still thought this movie was hilarious. I'm gonna have to go back and re-read it someday. The scene right after their encounter with the singing muses at the lake, when Ulysseus and Delmar think Pete has been turned into a toad is absolutely gut-busting.  Then when they come across him in the movie theater... damn, I can't even finish explaining the scene because I'm laughing so much right now just thinking about it.The acting is absolutely superb, particularly John Turturro as Pete who proves once again that he is one of the most underrated and multi-faceted actors working today. The story is comical and always interesting, and the cinematography looks fantastic perfectly re-creating the bleak, dusty, bone-dry Depression Era South of the 1930s. The Cohen brothers are absolute cinematic geniuses and have proven it time and time again over the years. It's just all in good fun. They don't take their art too seriously, and therefore they make TRULY GREAT art.'O Brother Where Art Thou?' is a modern classic, and if you don't get into upon your first viewing, then watch it again and I guarantee you it will grow on you. After my first viewing at my cousin' house I immediately went out and bought this movie, and since then I've watched it probably a good thirteen or fourteen times at least. I mean, I just can't get enough of it. The only recent movie that can even compare to it in terms of originality and entertainment is probably 'Snatch' which incidently I also have watched a ridiculous amount of times. And, on a final note, the bluegrass tunes in this movie are wildly addicitive, even if you don't like that kind of music. I find myself humming 'A Man of Constant Sorrow' to myself all the time.",5,"&quot;Damn, we're in a tight spot...

534450,A1V6X3STFFESI3,B00003CXRM,neverwithoutespresso,"[3, 4]","I cannot recommend O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? highly enough.The Coen brothers skillfully revive classical literature (The Odyessy of Homer) in the story of three wanderers trying to find their way home, and recall American history in a beautifully imaginative, archtypal way.For example, the main characters are three hoboes whose downright stupidity, ineptitude, pathos, and vulnerability are much too exaggerated to be realistic--and that's the point. They're supposed to be emblematic and archetypal, and as such they are a triumph.  They are also hysterically funny.  They are lost, vulnerable, dirty, unlettered but sweet and innocent, hopping freights, trying to keep body and soul together.George Clooney masterfully portrays one of the bedraggled trio, dumb, dizzy, clueless, but handsome and masterful, with more charm than the law allows--indeed he is consciously recalling the legendary charm of Clark Gable with grace.  I'm sure Gable would be honored.John Turturro is also clueless, dumb, and vulnerable, with intensity extreme anguish, and confusion added in.  The combination can't help but make you laugh.  He's the one that keeps ending up in deep doo-doo through no fault of his own.  He emits a silent scream that sends his buddies running to rescue him, stumbling all the way.The third of the team is mild mannered, dumb, confused, innocent, toothless, and incredibly sweet and supportive--up for anything he has to encounter (just like Ulysses).And the challenges are as daunting.  There is a chilling seen of a Klan meeting: There are hundreds of Klan members dressed in those evil, medieval-looking robes with the pointed hats, marching in a circle with burning torches, evoking the monkey guards of THE WIZARD OF OZ and the depraved monks in THE NAME OF THE ROSE.  They are approaching a huge, burning cross upon which they plan to lynch a black man.  This part is not funny.  But, again, it is even larger than life (if that is possible in the case of the Klan) and seems more of an archetype than an attempt to mimic reality.The snippets of folk music on the soundtrack throughut the movie are the icing on the cake.American history and its folkways are clearly close to the Coens' hearts.",5,Classical Archetype Meets Humor Meets Pathos Meets History,1150070400,"06 12, 2006",2006,2215,"['can', 'not', 'recommend', 'O', 'BROTHER', 'WHERE', 'ART', 'THOU', 'highly', 'enough.The', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'skillfully', 'revive', 'classical', 'literature', 'Odyessy', 'Homer', 'story', 'three', 'wanderers', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'home', 'recall', 'American', 'history', 'beautifully', 'imaginative', 'archtypal', 'way.For', 'example', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'three', 'hoboes', 'downright', 'stupidity', 'ineptitude', 'pathos', 'vulnerability', 'are', 'much', 'too', 'exaggerated', 'be', 'realistic', 'point', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'emblematic', 'archetypal', 'such', 'are', 'triumph', 'are', 'also', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'are', 'lost', 'vulnerable', 'dirty', 'unlettered', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'hopping', 'freights', 'trying', 'keep', 'body', 'soul', 'together.George', 'Clooney', 'masterfully', 'one', 'bedraggled', 'trio', 'dumb', 'dizzy', 'clueless', 'handsome', 'masterful', 'more', 'charm', 'law', 'indeed', 'consciously', 'recalling', 'legendary', 'charm', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'grace', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Gable', 'would', 'be', 'honored.John', 'Turturro', 'also', 'clueless', 'dumb', 'vulnerable', 'intensity', 'extreme', 'anguish', 'confusion', 'added', 'combination', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'make', 'laugh', 'one', 'ending', 'up', 'deep', 'doo-doo', 'fault', 'own', 'silent', 'scream', 'buddies', 'running', 'rescue', 'stumbling', 'way.The', 'third', 'team', 'mild', 'mannered', 'dumb', 'confused', 'innocent', 'toothless', 'incredibly', 'sweet', 'supportive', 'anything', 'encounter', 'just', 'Ulysses', '.And', 'challenges', 'are', 'daunting', 'chilling', 'seen', 'Klan', 'meeting', 'are', 'hundreds', 'Klan', 'members', 'dressed', 'evil', 'medieval-looking', 'robes', 'pointed', 'hats', 'marching', 'circle', 'burning', 'torches', 'evoking', 'monkey', 'guards', 'THE', 'WIZARD', 'OF', 'OZ', 'depraved', 'monks', 'THE', 'NAME', 'OF', 'THE', 'ROSE', 'are', 'approaching', 'huge', 'burning', 'cross', 'plan', 'lynch', 'black', 'man', 'part', 'not', 'funny', 'again', 'even', 'larger', 'life', 'possible', 'case', 'Klan', 'more', 'archetype', 'attempt', 'mimic', 'reality.The', 'snippets', 'folk', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'throughut', 'movie', 'are', 'icing', 'cake.American', 'history', 'folkways', 'are', 'clearly', 'close', 'Coens', 'hearts']","O Brother, Where Art Thou?"

I don't know either, but give him credit for a fabulously enjoyable movie.George Clooney is magnificent as Ulysses (that's really his name), an extremely witty and articulate convict who is obsessed with two things. The first is finding a hidden treasure from one of his earlier &quot;jobs,&quot; and second is his hair. The contrast between his brilliant and often incisive repartee, and the dull witted utterances of his oafish companions, is truly a sight to behold (can I say that about the spoken word?).The &quot;Odyssey&quot; theme is well developed, complete with Sirens and the Cyclops (played by none other than John Goodman, of course), and the movie loosely follows its plot line. There are some interesting allusions to the supernatural, and some blatant allegorizing of several characters, such as the ubiquitous &quot;boss&quot; sheriff with the fires of hell reflecting from his sunglasses. Several scenes are downright surreal, while others will have you holding your gut with laughter.

He also predicts that they'll have a great manyadventures along the way.And so begins a roller-coaster ride, which takes you along the tide ofemotions, with many a laugh all along, and a generous dose of greatfolk music (the movie is set in the depression era of 1930s).The acting is great - Clooney's outstanding, and is ably supported byJohn Torturro &amp; Tim Blake-Nelson, Holly Hunter &amp; a plethora of actorswith interesting cameos who keep coming all the time.The direction's even better, as the narrative flows smoothly - youdon't realize where the time goes, and there lots of 'little touches'here &amp; there which underscore the expert direction.But the real highlight is the great music, which is really infectious- in particular 'Man of constant sorrow', which is the showpiece song.I can't help humming it all the time, ever since i heard it !!Coming to the DVD, it's been put together very well - the 'productionfeaturette' gives you an insight into how the Coen brothers work andlittle tidbits about the movie &amp; the actors, and there are 'sneak peeks'and a video of 'A man of constant sorrow', apart from the trailor.But the part that i liked best was 'Painting with pixels', in which youget to know how Computers were used to give the scenes a unique feel.They show you he scenes as taken originally by the camera, and thenafter 'treatment' on the Computers. The 'before-after' difference isamazing ........All in all, a movie &amp; DVD i heartily recommend - two thumbs up :-) !!",5,"O brothers, thou art great !!",1012176000,"01 28, 2002",2002,2228,"['movie', 'was', 'quite', 'joyride', 'one', 'must', 'really', ""'doff"", 'one', 'hat', 'tothe', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'producer-director', 'duo', 'who', 'make', ""'different"", 'movies.The', 'movie', 'take-off', 'sorts', ""'The"", 'three', 'stooges', ""'Ullyses"", 'may', 'not', 'notice', 'looking', ""'production"", ""feauterette'-"", 'one', 'many', 'extras', 'included.The', 'story', 'Clooney', 'smooth-talking', 'convict', 'other', 'two', 'prisoners', 'chained', 'prison', 'farm', 'thathe', ""'d"", 'buried', 'treasure', 'getting', 'busted', 'escape', 'settingout', 'search', 'treasure.They', 'run', 'blind', 'old', 'man', 'who', ""'ll"", 'have', 'longjourney', 'end', ""'ll"", 'find', 'great', 'treasure', 'notthe', 'one', 'seek', 'also', ""'ll"", 'have', 'great', 'manyadventures', 'way.And', 'so', 'roller-coaster', 'ride', 'tide', 'ofemotions', 'many', 'laugh', 'along', 'generous', 'dose', 'greatfolk', 'music', 'movie', 'set', 'depression', 'era', '1930s', '.The', 'acting', 'great', 'Clooney', 'outstanding', 'ably', 'supported', 'byJohn', 'Torturro', 'amp', 'Tim', 'Blake-Nelson', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'amp', 'plethora', 'actorswith', 'interesting', 'cameos', 'who', 'keep', 'coming', 'time.The', 'direction', 'even', 'better', 'narrative', 'flows', 'smoothly', 'youdo', ""n't"", 'realize', 'where', 'time', 'there', 'lots', ""'little"", ""touches'here"", 'amp', 'underscore', 'expert', 'real', 'highlight', 'great', 'music', 'really', 'infectious-', 'particular', ""'Man"", 'constant', 'sorrow', 'showpiece', 'song.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'humming', 'time', 'ever', 'i', 'heard', 'Coming', 'DVD', 'been', 'put', 'together', 'very', 'well', ""'productionfeaturette"", 'insight', 'how', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'work', 'andlittle', 'tidbits', 'movie', 'amp', 'actors', 'are', ""'sneak"", 'video', 'man', 'constant', 'sorrow', 'apart', 'trailor.But', 'part', 'i', 'liked', 'best', 'was', ""'Painting"", 'pixels', 'youget', 'know', 'how', 'Computers', 'were', 'used', 'give', 'scenes', 'unique', 'feel.They', 'show', 'taken', 'originally', 'camera', 'thenafter', ""'treatment"", 'Computers', ""'before-after"", 'difference', 'isamazing', '..All', 'movie', 'amp', 'DVD', 'i', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'two', 'thumbs']","O Brother, Where Art Thou?"

The three cons are hilariously played by George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson and John Tuturro.  Mr. Clooney in particular shines as Everett.  He fashions himself as an intellectual and his crazed obsession with his hair is hysterical.  Everywhere he goes he must have Dapper Dan pomade and hairnets.  Along the way on their journey, they met a man who sold his soul to the devil in order to play a mean guitar,  cut a record as The Soggy Bottom Boys that, unbeknownst to them becomes a big hit, met three sirens who seduce them, met a crooked bible salesman (played with hilarious gusto by John Goodman) and cross paths with the governor (Charles Durning).  In the end Everett is really looking to stop his wife (Holly Hunter) from remarrying.  The film strings together all of its twists and turns brilliantly.

This ranks right up there as one of their crowning achievements.This is a re-telling of the &quot;Odyssey&quot; by Homer and after viewing this, I finally got a handle on just what the &quot;Odyssey&quot; was about.  In a nutshell, it follows the exploits of a man and the exotic characters he meets along his journey.  The way the Coen Brothers personified such stalwart literary characters as the Cyclops (John Goodman) and the Furies is most creative.Excellent performances all around from the likes of George Clooney (in one of his most endearing roles), the incomparable John Goodman, Holly Hunter, John Turturo, Charles Durning and a wonderfully strong supporting cast.However, one cannot mention the merits of this movie without a mention of the soundtrack.  It is most obvious that the Coen Brothers invested an enormous amount of research to make sure that the music adequately accompnaied the mood and tone.  A wonderfully indelible example is the use of an acapella song (that utilizes no words, only moans) still used in African-American churches that is beautifully realized.The music in this project is positively spellbinding, regardless of your particular musical preferences - there is something here for everybody.

The extra material on the single DVD includes the trailer, the music video of &quot;I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow,&quot; a &quot;making of..&quot; featuring directors/writers/producers Ethan and Joel Coen and &quot;Painting with Pixels,&quot; an intriguing look at the use of computers in making this feature.  While most of the colateral material is the standard stuff, the Painting with Pixels is an interesting foray into the use of computers to create effects on screen and the treatment of the film when completed.  Cinematographer Rodger Deakins explains his job creating the final cut, then the computer artists take over, working with him to get a unique look and feel for the entire film.  I was amazed at the information in this piece.The Coen Brothers generously credit Homer with the top writing credit.  Homer, a Greek poet, wrote The Odessy, upon which the film is loosely base.  Joel and Ethan added the Three Stooges and the Depression-era South, swirled in some instantly likable bluegrass music and came up with a winner of movie.The film begins with the escape of our heros from a chain gang in the backwoods of Mississippi.  Our adventurers are supposedly in pursuit of 1.2 million dollars buried at the home of this Ulysess (George Clooney).  Clooney plays a wonderful Moe Howard, always willing to throw in an esoteric word or two to liven the conversation.  His buddies John Turturro (Larry) and Tim Blake Nelson (Curley) and he try to escape the movie's antagonist, beautifully underplayed by Daniel von Bargen (seemingly straight out of Cool Hand Luke).During their escapades our trio mixes it up with three &quot;sirens&quot; (singing the most alluring version of the old black lullaby &quot;Didn't Leave Nobody but the Baby&quot; that I have ever heard), a church choir, a &quot;cyclops&quot; (John Goodman with a eye-patch, stealing his scenes with panache) and the Ku Klux Klan.Don't look for historical accuracy in this film.  The Klan was never noted as either good dancers or good chanters and &quot;Baby Face&quot; Nelson dies in a hail of bullets not the electric chair.But the Coen Brothers aren't reaching out for accuracy.

But so many people claimed its virtues, I began wondering if I'd just been in a bad frame of mind at the time.  Having now seen  ""Oh Brother,"" by the same filmmakers, I know my impression of ""Fargo"" was no mistake.  ""Oh Brother"" suffers from many of the same problems.Both films overwhelmingly rely on trite and shallow stereotypes of people (Fargo-Upper Midwesterners;  Brother-Southerners) for their humor-such as it is.  ....  It's one thing to laugh at human foibles, it's another to make disparaging characterizations the central focus of the film-especially when there's little else to commend.""Oh Brother"" skips along, illogically, with subplots that appear and disappear without any development and, often, without connection.  For example, three escaped cons and a guitar player they meet on the road, hornswoggle their way on to a radio broadcast singing a highly polished rendition of ""Man of Constant Sorrow""-although their connection to music up to that point in the film is non-existent.Later, they happen upon three sultry young women (Sirens) in the woods.  The possibilities look good for our three cons when (poof!) two are now on the ground, waking-the third gone.  No clue as to what happened in between.  Kirk Douglas made us live, vividly, through every moment of his encounter with Sirens.  ""Oh Brother"" by contrast, doesn't bother with such details.  It's enough to say, ""We met `em--let's move on to the next scene.""  And don't forget the corn pone.Elsewhere, filmgoers are treated to a train, a mass baptism, a Ku Klux Klan rally, a bank robbery, a swindling Bible salesman, corrupt politicians, hound dogs and a sheriff with mirrored-glasses.  Get the connection?  Hee haw!""Oh Brother"" has been widely associated with a resurgence or discovery of bluegrass music, the soundtrack selling millions.  I, therefore, expected music to be at the forefront of the film.  It isn't really (contrast with ""The Blues Brothers""--where good music is at the fore and the plot is discernible).There are couple of nice bluegrass moments, however.  In one, a group of people are singing as they walk toward a baptismal pool.  In the other, The Whites are on a stage, looking as if they might be the Carter family (the film is set in the 30s)--singing ""Sunny Side of the Mountain.""  But these moments, unfortunately, are short and they don't make up for the rest of the film.I'm puzzled at the connection of this film with bluegrass for one of the things that makes this type of music attractive is its authenticity.  Bluegrass and old-time country is heartfelt, simple music, shorn of pretense and connected with the lives of real people.  But there's nothing at all authentic about ""Oh Brother,"" the film.  In fact, it's almost as if the film is mocking the music.  I was sorely disappointed to hear Ralph Stanley's voice (in its only appearance) coming out from behind a Ku Klux Klan hood.Based on the film, the music on the soundtrack is probably pretty good.  But don't expect the film to be a representation of the spirit of that music.",2,Not bona-fide,1058572800,"07 19, 2003",2003,3118,"['When', 'saw', 'Fargo', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'unimpressed', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'claimed', 'virtues', 'began', 'wondering', ""'d"", 'just', 'been', 'bad', 'frame', 'mind', 'time', 'Having', 'now', 'seen', 'Oh', 'Brother', 'same', 'filmmakers', 'know', 'impression', 'Fargo', 'was', 'mistake', 'Oh', 'Brother', 'suffers', 'many', 'same', 'problems.Both', 'films', 'overwhelmingly', 'rely', 'trite', 'shallow', 'stereotypes', 'people', 'Fargo-Upper', 'Midwesterners', 'Brother-Southerners', 'humor-such', 'one', 'thing', 'laugh', 'human', 'foibles', 'make', 'disparaging', 'characterizations', 'central', 'focus', 'film-especially', 'when', 'little', 'else', 'commend', 'Oh', 'Brother', 'skips', 'illogically', 'subplots', 'appear', 'disappear', 'development', 'often', 'connection', 'example', 'three', 'escaped', 'cons', 'guitar', 'player', 'meet', 'road', 'hornswoggle', 'way', 'radio', 'broadcast', 'singing', 'highly', 'polished', 'rendition', 'Man', 'Constant', 'Sorrow', 'connection', 'music', 'up', 'point', 'film', 'non-existent.Later', 'happen', 'three', 'sultry', 'young', 'women', 'Sirens', 'woods', 'possibilities', 'look', 'good', 'three', 'cons', 'when', 'poof', 'two', 'are', 'now', 'ground', 'waking-the', 'third', 'gone', 'clue', 'what', 'happened', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'made', 'live', 'vividly', 'moment', 'encounter', 'Sirens', 'Oh', 'Brother', 'contrast', ""n't"", 'bother', 'such', 'details', 'enough', 'say', 'met', 'em', 'let', 'move', 'next', 'scene', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'corn', 'pone.Elsewhere', 'filmgoers', 'are', 'treated', 'train', 'mass', 'baptism', 'Ku', 'Klux', 'Klan', 'rally', 'bank', 'robbery', 'swindling', 'Bible', 'salesman', 'corrupt', 'politicians', 'hound', 'dogs', 'sheriff', 'mirrored-glasses', 'Get', 'connection', 'Hee', 'haw', 'Oh', 'Brother', 'been', 'widely', 'associated', 'resurgence', 'discovery', 'bluegrass', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'selling', 'millions', 'therefore', 'expected', 'music', 'be', 'forefront', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'contrast', 'Blues', 'Brothers', 'where', 'good', 'music', 'fore', 'plot', 'discernible', 'are', 'couple', 'nice', 'bluegrass', 'moments', 'however', 'one', 'group', 'people', 'are', 'singing', 'walk', 'baptismal', 'pool', 'other', 'Whites', 'are', 'stage', 'looking', 'might', 'be', 'Carter', 'family', 'film', 'set', '30s', 'singing', 'Sunny', 'Side', 'Mountain', 'moments', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'short', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'rest', 'film.I', ""'m"", 'puzzled', 'connection', 'film', 'bluegrass', 'one', 'things', 'type', 'music', 'attractive', 'authenticity', 'Bluegrass', 'old-time', 'country', 'heartfelt', 'simple', 'music', 'shorn', 'pretense', 'connected', 'lives', 'real', 'people', 'nothing', 'authentic', 'Oh', 'Brother', 'film', 'fact', 'almost', 'film', 'mocking', 'music', 'was', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'hear', 'Ralph', 'Stanley', 'voice', 'only', 'appearance', 'coming', 'out', 'Ku', 'Klux', 'Klan', 'hood.Based', 'film', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'probably', 'pretty', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'film', 'be', 'representation', 'spirit', 'music']","O Brother, Where Art Thou?"

534474,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00003CXRM,Reviewer,"[33, 38]","Producers/writers/directors Joel and Ethan Coen evoke the essence of such classic films as ""Sullivan's Travels"" and ""I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang,"" with their Depression Era comedy, ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" directed by Joel Coen and starring George Clooney.  Borrowing the title of the ""meaningful"" film that successful comedy filmmaker Sullivan wanted to make in the 1941 Preston Sturges film ""Sullivan's Travels,"" and finally-- in reality-- making it, is only the beginning of this clever, funny tale based on Homer's ""The Odyssey.""  The hero here is one Ulysses Everett McGill (Clooney), who along with two others, Pete (John Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson), escapes from a chain gang, commencing an ""odyssey"" for the trio wherein they ultimately traverse many of the railroads, back roads and tank-water towns scattered throughout the good State of Mississippi.  It becomes an adventure of the first magnitude as the three cohorts encounter situations and characters that are humorous and sometimes poignant, and-- for the audience-- always fun.  It's a richly woven tapestry of Americana (including plenty of traditional music) that is bound to leave an indelible impression in the mind of the viewer.  Leading man Clooney has one of his best character roles yet-- it's a Clooney we've never quite seen before-- and he is more than up to the task.  Invested with the mustache and rugged good looks of Clark Gable, and with his natural charisma working overtime, he creates a likable, articulate character that stands out in marked contrast to just about every other character in the film.  And he's a joy to watch; his Ulysses is a real kick from start to finish, and it's a performance that is worthy of an Oscar.  Turturro, as well, creates one of his most memorable screen characters, drawing heavily upon the naturally quirky side of his own personality and accentuating his own unique physical traits which lend themselves so well to the embodiment of Pete.  And Nelson does the same with his Delmar; like Turturro, he successfully captures the soul of the character, both physically and emotionally, and-- it must be mentioned-- both actors (with Coen's help, of course) manage to avoid the trap of making their characters mere stereotypes, and it's one of the reasons they are so engaging:  These guys are the genuine article.  The extraordinary supporting cast, all of whom individually create truly original characters in their own right, includes Holly Hunter (Penny), John Goodman (Big Dan), Chris Thomas King (Tommy), Charles Durning (Pappy O'Daniel), Del Pentecost (Junior O'Daniel) and Michael Badalucco in a memorable turn as George ""Babyface"" Nelson.  Not content to sit on their laurels, the Coen Brothers constantly seek to expand the boundaries of their personal cinematic universe, and they succeed splendidly with ""O Brother Where Art Thou?""  It's a rousingly warm and witty and-- most importantly-- highly entertaining and creative film that takes the viewer on an unforgettable journey.  The Coen's distinct imprint, like the cinematic equivalent of The Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, is stamped on every frame of the film, and it's like an assurance of quality and a good time to be had by all.  There's magic in the movies the Coen Brothers make, and this one goes far toward proving what anyone who has followed their movies over the years knows already:  Nobody does it quite like Joel and Ethan.

I hate to think that I'm swayed by critics, but,in this case, I guess I was. What we have here is a wonderful narrative of three very individual prople, escaping from prison (but &quot;nice guys&quot; so it's OK). Most of their collective motive is greed, but some great bonding ensues, friendships develop (new &amp; old), conflicts happen, etc. Put it in the hands of Joel &amp; Ethan Coen and you have (another) unique blend of movie-making and thought-provoking controlled insanity. I loved this film! What a pleasure to see John Turturro in a somewhat under-control performance. I'm not sure that I've ever heard of Tim Blake Nelson, but he's a brilliant actor (best in the film, I think), truly supporting an incredible performance from George Clooney. The two were a real &quot;pair&quot;. Another reason I avoided this film was it's Oscar nomination for screenplay in the &quot;adapted&quot; category (suggesting its basis as Homer's Odyssey!). How presumptuous, I thought. Well,leave it to the Coen's. I don't know any mistake they've ever made in a movie: &quot;Blood Simple&quot;, best murder mystery ever, &quot;Raising Arizona&quot;, second best comedy ever; &quot;Miller's Crossing&quot;, second-best gangster movie ever; and &quot;Fargo&quot;, their best &quot;everything&quot; movie. I love the Coen's (though I admit I still don't understand &quot;Barton Fink&quot;, though it was a wonderfully scathing comment on the Hollywood movie-making process).There's a continuing, innate sweetness about this film, though it pulls no punches. The Ku Klux Klan is presented as too organized and with political overtones...which may be true, and which may be the Coen's idea to expose this group as heartless and evil as they are (and, especially, were back in the 30's). Tackling some outrageously seriously themes, the Coen's have once again succeeded in making the ugliest of reality seem to be amusing and utterly entertaining. It must be very tough to make light of some of the most horrible moments in history...Mel Brooks did it and so did Benigni; Billy Wilder (Stalag 17) &amp; Stanley Kubrick (Dr. Strangelove).

I was excited about the release of the film on dvd and bought it on the day of the release, the extra features are minimal, and think they are a lot funnier and impressive than they actually are and the menu is just annoying.The film does have its ups, george is suprisingly good, so good in fact that the critics forgot to actually watch him closely enough to see he is playing a very easy part, with pretty much the same lines repeated over and over in a different order, hair, treasure, hair, wife, moeny, hair. And whilst he babbles on about hair nets (which at first is pure genius but soon rather stupid), the story takes it time to meander through a 'musical' type structure which to be fair is predictable and unbelievable.

While ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" may not be Joel and Ethan's best, the film certainly has more than enough redeeming qualities to be a pretty enjoyable one. Humor was a constant all the way through, although it was often more subtle than I expected it to be. It took me no time at all to pick up on the parallels between 'O Brother' and Homer's ""The Odyssey"", and going into my second viewing knowing this film was based on that made it even more aparent. The story follows three guys through 1930's Mississippi on a mission to find a burried treasure, that turns out to be more than they expected.George Clooney, John Tuturro and Tim Nelson play Everett, Pete and Delmar. This goes without saying, but George Clooney was fantastic. I've been hearing people say he's overrated a bit too often lately. I call bullshit. He's one of the wittiest, and gives some of the greatest soft-spoken perfoamces that I've seen. Maybe watching this film right after The Descendants allowed me to appreciate his abilities even more. Tim Blake was pretty good as dimwitted Delmar, and I often felt bad for Tuturro's Pete. I especially liked John Goodman's appearance, despite how short it was. There are always memorable moments in the Coen Brothers' films, and O Brother Where Art Thou does not disappoint. It has quite a few memorable moments, and this is the only film I can think of that'll make you both laugh and feel bad for cows at the same time.

534483,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00003CXRM,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 2]","O Brother, Where Art Thou? (Joel and Ethan Coen, 2000)First and foremost: the person who decided that the score for this film needed nominating for an Oscar should be boiled in lead. Even if some of the other pieces therein were engaging, catchy, etc., the version of ""I'll Fly Away"" that ""graces"" this soundtrack is the very resurrection of the shrieking out-of-tune harridans whose off-key warbling made the soundtracks to so many fifties and sixties musicals unlistenable. Even worse, whatever infernal power resurrected them allowed the decay of forty years of neglect to stay in their vocal cords, and they sound worse than ever.All right, aside from that, this movie was kinda fun. Far more mainstram than one expects from the Brothers Coen, especially with the nose-thumbs they presented society with in their last film, the brilliantly funny Fargo (1996). But they do go on to assert, and with enough backing to make it believable, that no, mainstream does not have to equal crap. They do this mostly the way they always do it-- by getting the finest possible ensemble cast to worm its way through their twisted scripts.In this case, Jason and his Argonauts (you did know it's based-- very, very loosely-- on The Odyssey, right?) are George Clooney, an unrecognizable John Turturro, and the slightly more recognizable Tim Blake Nelson, last scene in yet another cameo in The Thin Red Line. (Nelson's been spending more time behind thecamera these days, having recently finished directing _O_, the newest film retelling of the Bard's play Othello.) They are besieged and beset by some of the more memorable characters from Homer's work, most notably a Cyclopean John Goodman and Michael Badalucco as Babyface Nelson (I know, given the number of roles this guy had, I shouldn't keep referring to him as ""the guy who played Davey Zifrin on Law and Order,"" but jeez, he was SO good in that role...). Add in Holly Hunter, fresh from a stint in the indie world, as Clooney's wayward wife, and you've got a fun little flick. It probably won't be remembered as the height of the Brothers Coen's career, but if you turn the sound off during ""I'll Fly Away,"" it's a worthy enough addition to the corpus.",3,Cast: good.

While there are many very, very good things in this film it is dominated by its soundtrack, and well after seeing the movie, after you have forgotten the characters and what they said, you will vividly remember the music.  Burnett also was the musical director for THE BIG LEBOWSKI, and I was tremendoulsy impressed in that one with his musical selections, especially the hysterical Spanish language version of &quot;Hotel California.&quot;  But Burnett outdid himself in O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU?  All of the songs were newly recorded for the film, but each one felt as if it had stepped right out of the 1920s or 1930s, when they were all written.  Every single one of the songs was memorably and magnificently performed, in particular the great traditional song &quot;Man of Constant Sorrows,&quot; whose unexpected success on the radio plays a major role in the movie's plot.(Sidenote:  anyone who loved the version of &quot;Man of Constant Sorrows&quot; in this film owes it to themselves to search out a CD with the Stanley Brothers performing this song.  Ralph Stanly in fact performed one of the songs in the move:  the eerie &quot;Oh Death&quot; performed at the KKK ralley.  The Stanley Brothers consisted of Ralph and his slightly older brother Carter.  As good as Ralph is, Carter Stanley, who unfortunately died in 1966, had almost without question the greatest voice in the history of Bluegrass.  And absolutely no one ever sang &quot;Man of Constant Sorrows&quot; better than Carter Stanley.  Whereas Ralph possesses a fine voice that is somewhere between a low tenor and a high baritone, Carter possessed a high, brilliant, piercing tenor that is one of the glories of American folk music.)The music alone makes this a great movie.  Without it, the movie would have lost a lot of its cohesion and texture.  I am a huge fan of the Coen Brothers, but if you take away the music, this film would probably rate as their weakest film yet with the exception of THE HUDSUCKER PROXY.  The film on its own doesn't quite cohere at every moment, and there are some moments that are just flat out weak.  But as a whole, the movie has a tremendous period feel and a wealth of great minor characters.I thought George Clooney excelled as an escaped convict with a penchant for Dapper Dan hair pomade and sentences that make him sound considerably smarter than he is.So, my recommendation is twofold:  first, see and enjoy the movie.  Second, run out and buy the soundtrack!  This movie just might have the best movie soundtrack to have come out in several years.",5,The Star ot the Film is . . .

534489,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CXRM,Roland E. Zwick,"[8, 23]","""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?""  is ostensibly based on Homer's ""The Odyssey,"" but I have no reason to doubt the Coen Brothers when they say that they've never actually read it.  The film really has nothing to do with that epic poem other than the fact that the filmmakers throw plot elements from the original haphazardly into the mix every now and then.  Need a Cyclops?  Dress John Goodman up in an eye patch to no point or purpose.  Sirens?  Have the main characters stumble across three beautiful women singing and washing clothes by a riverside, even though the scene seems totally contrived and arbitrary in the context of the story.  The Coen Brothers' lack of familiarity with the original is only too apparent.Actually, this is one of their worst films, no doubt about it - slow, arch, disjointed and heavy-handed in both its plotting and its humor.  The original ""Odyssey"" was an epic tale filled with adventure, high drama and great themes involving issues of courage, pride, commitment and love.  ""Oh Brother"" is none of these.  It is, in fact, silly, cramped and trivial.  The role of Ulysses has been assigned to George Clooney, as the leader of a trio of convicts who escape from a chain gang in the Depression Era Midwest.  As they roam the countryside, they encounter a myriad of bizarre, eccentric characters, some derived loosely from ""The Odyssey"" and some not.  None of it really works, partly due to the arbitrariness of the plotting and partly due to the fact that the humor is not very well executed.  In fact, most of the wit consists of having the actors overplay their facial expressions and accents.  As a result of these two factors, the strain never ceases to show.So are there any good things to be found in ""Oh Brother""?  Well, the movie does look good, thanks to fine cinematography and art direction, which beautifully capture the look of the dusty rural countryside of the 1930's.

Lots of Americana in it (besides the great music).  It's not necessary to ""get"" the allusions, but I think those who hated the plot misunderstood it.  One criticism, however, does seem valid. O Brother relies on a lot of rural/Southern stereotypes.  The Coens are often smug in their character-mockery.

The stellar cast (including George Clooney, John Turturro, John Goodman, and Holly Hunter) shines. All of the characters are quirky to say the least: a one-eyed KKK Bible salesman, a Dapper Dan-obsessed intellectual jailbird, a blues guitarist who sold his soul to the devil, a blind ""prophet,"" the Devil bent on revenge. This is a Coles Notes approach to Homer at best (even the directors, Joel and Ethan Cohen (""Fargo,"" ""The Big Lebowski,"" ""Raising Arizona"") admit to never actually having read ""The Odyssey,"" the story on which ""O Brother"" is based), yet is unusual and highly entertaining in its own right.Fueled by an eclectic soundtrack, ""O Brother"" brought about an unheard-of resurgence of early country music, winning the Grammy Award for Best Soundtrack and outselling most other CDs that year. The selections include gospel, blues, a chain gang song (""Po Lazarus"") and a hobo anthem (""Big Rock Candy Mountain""), along with plenty of toe-tapping country music from The Soggy Bottom Boys (fronted by Union Station's Dan Tyminski), Alison Krauss, Gillian Welsh, Emmylou Harris, and more.The film has an unusual look as well: it was digitally edited to give it the washed-out appearance of the Dust Bowl during the Great Depression. There is a very interesting documentary about this process on the DVD; it is the first film to use this technique in North America (although not in Europe). In fact, there are several interesting extras on the DVD, including a making-of, a music video for ""I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow,""  and a script-to-storyboard comparison. ""O Brother"" is filled with fun, unexpected turns and twists, and a great soundtrack.

534502,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B00003CXRM,Scott Schiefelbein,"[11, 12]","While my favorite Coen brothers' film is &quot;Miller's Crossing,&quot; &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; is my favorite comedy by these two mavericks.Loosely based on Homer's &quot;The Odyssey,&quot; earning an Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay even though the Coens' admitted to reading only the Cliff Notes, &quot;O Brother&quot; is the Coens' tribute to American bluegrass music.  For some reason, this movie was shamefully snubbed at the Oscars, but George Clooney earned his Golden Globe award for best actor.Clooney plays the fast-talking Clark Gable wannabe, Ulysses Everett MacGill.  Unfortunately for Ulysses, his mouth runs about five steps ahead of his brain, and his delight in the clever, hyper-articulate use of the English language cannot mask his delightful naivete.  In a performance of sly self-mockery (can you think of another major film star who would so earnestly ask for a hair net to sleep in or speak movingly about being a &quot;Dapper Dan Man&quot;?), Clooney steals one heck of a show.Ulysses escapes from a chain gang in Depression-era Mississippi with his sidekicks, the hot-blooded Pete (John Turturro) and easy-going Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson).  Allegedly going to find some treasure before a river gets dammed, sinking the treasure beneath a deep lake, this trio begins a bizarre journey across the Deep South.Along the way they meet guitarist Tommy Johnson, who followed an American musical legend by selling his soul to the devil at a crossroads in exchange for the ability to play the guitar, Big Jim Teague (the Cyclops), three Sirens, a blind seer, Baby Face Nelson, a spelling-challenged rifle-toting youngster, and Governor Pappy O'Daniel (conveniently relocated from Texas to Mississippi).  Recalling the ultimate road story of the Odyssey, &quot;O Brother&quot; breezes from episode to episode with delightful ease.As ever with Coen brothers' films, the movie looks wonderful and feels authentic.  You can feel the oppressive heat of the Mississippi sunshine, you choke on dusty roads, and you glory in the greens and yellows of the languid countryside.  Unlike so many films set in the Old South, characters are fully-realized (even if hilariously flawed) rather than caricatures.  The minor details of daily life in the South (a mild oath from Ulysses gets a stern warning -- &quot;Watch your mouth, young feller, this is a public shop&quot;) are delightful touches.Of course, the true star of this movie, other than Clooney, is the soundtrack.

534506,A3PIJJ4J2DDI6Q,B00003CXRM,"Shawn M. Warswick ""High School History Teacher""","[6, 6]","In their latest film, O Brother Where Art Thou?, the Coen Brothers use their quirky mix of humour and high brow production to satirize Homer's The Odyssey.  Set in depression era south, the film is the comic saga of three convicts on the run done only as the Coen's can.Like all of their other films, this one contains an ensemble cast of characters unique and compelling.  First, we have Ulysses Everett Mcgill (played to the hilt by George Clooney), a smooth talking man with a streak of vanity a mile wide.  He has a tendency to repeat things (as most Coen characters do) and has a thing for his hair and hair pomade.  George's performance shows he is an actor capable of true greatness.  Why he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for this performance is beyond me.  The good thing is it garnered a Golden Globe for him, and was well earned.John Turturro makes an appearance in this film as well (seems like he is in almost every Coen film).  Here he plays the serious side kick named Pete and delivers a great performance in this role.  The best part is his reaction to The Sirens.  Not quite as good as his performance in The Big Lebowski (that was the best!) but nonetheless, quite good.All of this is set against a backdrop of beautiful scenery and wonderful cinematography thanks to longtime Coen Brother's collaborator Roger Deakins.  Once again the technical aspect of the film is right on the money, the film is stylish without being campy.  The musical score, supplied by T Bone Burnett, is a wonderful amalgamation of blues, bluegrass, gospel and more.I can highly recommend this film if you wish to add a bit of Coen brother quirkiness to your collection.

They cover just about all of my observations well and there's no need to repeat them. I am in my 70's and remember the great depression well. It was another world that this flick depicts accurately, albeit without all of the intense sorrow that also went with those hard times.  Judging from the automobiles and events depicted in this film it was set in 1938, give or take a year. It brought back many personal memories.There really was a Governor &quot;pappy&quot; Lee O'daniel who was associated with a flour company and a country music group, but the real one was governor of Texas (not Mississippi) from 1939 through 1941, defeating Lyndon Johnson. I can still remember Lee O'Daniel's Light Crust Doughboys on the radio every evening.  The catch phrase in their bumper music was &quot;Please pass the biscuits, pappy.&quot;Casting in the film was perfect. Many locals were undoubtedly used because no actor could depict the country characters so authentically. The music was as it really sounded back then.  It was refreshing to escape to the real thing without today's slick and professionally perfect plastic sounds. The songs were truly representative of the era, as I remember it.This is a relaxing, refreshing, no-think film that works well on many levels. Every time you see it you see something you missed on previous viewings.  I completely missed its esoteric parody of Homer's Odyssey the first two times.If you are in the mood for a fast moving, outrageosuly funny comedy that doesn't require delving into heavy, dark, brooding, depressing, and stressful psychological concepts, then this is the film for you. Even the manic-depressive behavior of &quot;Babyface&quot; Nelson was depicted in an hilarious manner.This film consists of many sub-plots, all masterfully woven together into a coherent string, each serving as a vehicle for great comedy and wonderful country music as it was played, sung, and heard in the 1930's. I can't praise this film enough. It should have received many top awards, but we all know that awards are based on advertising budgets and Hollywood politics, not quality of the craft.See this film once and you will want your own copy to view over and over again.

534511,A3FZ06XRKW5JC5,B00003CXRM,"snalen ""snalen""","[11, 12]","There really is nobody in mainstream American cinema to touch the Coen Brothers. Young aspiring screenwriters must look at most big Hollywood movies and think, Oh gee, I could write better than that so easily. Then they must look at what the Coens write and think, Oh gee, I could never write like that. As screen writers, the C. Bros are giants in a race of pygmies.At the heart of their work are three of the finest films ever made in the United States, made consecutively, ""Fargo"", ""The Big Lebowski"" and this. One of the glorious things about these three films is how different they are. ""Fargo"" is a police procedural and morality tale set in the snowbound backwater of Minnesota, ""Big Lebowski"" a glorious send up of film noir set in the asinine wilderness of Los Angeles. ""Oh Brother"" is a musical epic, an enchantment, set in Depression era Mississippi. If the idea here is to signal which movies are not simply worth seeing but specifically worth buying, where a movie worth buying is a movie that will delight not just on a single viewing but repeatedly, on viewing it again and again, all these three movies are eminently worth singling out. I've seen them all several times now and they just get better.  Many movies get to be classics because of just one or two scenes that have some peculiar magic. This movie is composed almost entirely of such scenes.In essence it's a comedy and seems to spring from an almost infinite well of comic invention. Here we get George Clooney as Ulysses Everett McGill, the smooth talking ""Odysseus"" character with his loquacity and vanity, John Goodman as Big Dan Teague, the one-eyed ""Cyclops"" (with an neat pun on that word's murky second life as a term for a KKK officeholder) bible salesman and thief, Michael Badalucco as George ""Baby Face"" Nelson the manic depressive cow-hating bank robber, Stephen Root as the strangely manic blind recording engineer and radio station manager in the middle of nowhere, Wayne Duvall as Homer Stokes the KKK-affiliated candidate for governor with his performing midget, Charles Durning  as Menelaus ""Pappy"" O Daniel, the incumbent governor, terrified of losing, Holly Hunter as Mrs ""Penelope"" McGill who has told her army of children that her fallen ex-husband was run over by a train, Ray McKinnon as her suitor who, inverting the Homeric source, is more than a match for Everett in a bout of fisticuffs,  Lee Weaver as the ""Tiresias"" character, the blind driver of a handcar, and Daniel von Bargen as an avenging angel, the sheriff, who is also at once The Devil and the Greek God Neptune. All the above act like people who never expect to be offered a better-written part and many of them never will. Quite good comic films could be made from one twentieth of the cinematic ideas on display here. The Coens just have such an abundance of them, they toss them off, exult briefly in them, and them move gaily on to the next. If there's one quibble, it might be Pete and Delmar, McGill's companions, who have escaped with him from a chain gang. While Walter Sobchak in ""The Big Lebowski"" was not merely an idiot but a magnificent, outrageous idiot of Dickensian dimensions, these two, though certainly well enough acted by John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson, are much closer to being stock comic characters whose plain unembellished dumbness is intended to render them funny. If ""Big Lebowski"" is a better comic film, as I think it is, I'd single that out as a reason why.As well as the Coen's, the movie's magnificence owes a large debt to T Bone Burnett who put the music together. It's very much a musical and the soundtrack is pure heaven to listen to, especially those items involving the marvellous singing of Alison Krauss and Gillian Welch. Though if there is one slightly off note here too, it is Ralph Stanley's ""O Death"" sung by a hooded KKK chief who turns out to be Stokes.

They stuck with the idea of including any idea that was funny and slightly strange, but this time they imposed a plot that made sense. Like Fargo --- which was supposed to be based on a true story but really wasn't --- Oh Brother Where Art Thou is based on the Odyssey (a seemingly true story that they could use when it served them, or dump when it didn't). Then they  added the Depression, southern politics, and lots of music.If this had been written and directed by anyone else, it would have been a mess. But with the Coen brothers, it's a musical comedy disguised as a screwball period piece. It helps that the casting is perfect. From the three principal actors to the major secondary characters (like John Goodman's Big Dan Teague/Cyclops) to the smaller parts (like the governor's two dim-bulb campaign managers and the radio station owner) every actor is funny and perfectly in sync with the tone of the film.The Coens added quite a bit of computer effects and all of it works. The obvious example is the color-grading. The short documentary on the DVD shows how computers were used to wash out colors and tint different scenes. Then there are small parts, such as the underwater shot of Dapper Dan cans and a dog floating  by. Those cans are computer-generated, and the dog was composited into the shot. You don't notice this stuff until the third or fourth time you see it. Once you notice, it makes the movie even better.This is one of the best Coen brothers movies, and one of the best movies of the last 10 years.

These two guys from Minnesota have given us some of the most original and funny movies of the last 20 years. After releasing a modern day classic with &quot;THE BIG LEBOWSKI&quot;, the Coens then gave us the depression era comedy &quot;O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?&quot;. With the Coens you never know what to expect, but you know it will always be a well made movie that gets better with repeat viewings. This movie ranks in the Coens top 3 behind &quot;FARGO&quot;, and just ahead of &quot;RAISING ARIZONA&quot;. The movie has top notch performances from John Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson, John Goodman, Charles Durning, and if you ask me a very Oscar worthy turn by George Clooney. One of the Coen brothers great talents is too paint a great picture of when and where the story is taking place, and this movie falls right in line. Set in the heart of the Mississippi during the depression, Clooney and his partners in crime travel thru absolutely beautiful delta land in search of their goal. Just watching it makes me want to sip on an ice cold lemonade, no kiddin'. The film transfer and colors are excellent on this release. Basicly, you've got a great movie with great performances, but this all actually takes a back seat to the best part of the movie, the music. Leave it up to the Coens to bring roots music back to the to the attention of music fans everywhere. The music is great, fits right in with the story, and the sound on this disc is perfect. Definetly no complaints with the movie, a must see. The disc includes a cool but not long enough featurette, post production process, the Soggy Bottom Boys music video, theatrical trailer, and a very interesting script to storyboard feature.

534520,A3U56M0Y8LYO6J,B00003CXRM,"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict""","[14, 29]","The Coen Brothers bring the story of Homer's The Odyssey into the twentieth century in ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" and the result is a mixed bag.  The film follows Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Pete (John Turturro), and Delmar O'Donnell (Tim Blake Nelson) through Mississippi during the Depression years as they come into contact with a number of colorful characters and situations.  The Coens do a wondeful job of capturing the mood of the era by populating the film with bluegrass music and images of chain gangs, cotton fields, hobos, and bogus medicines, but these assorted elements never mesh.  The film seems to be just a jumble of component parts that don't add up to anything when put together.  There's a semblance of a story at the outset when McGill recuits his two cohorts to help him find a hidden treasure but this story thread becomes lost among a Klan rally, an encounter with sirens, meetings with pompous politicans, and a picnic with a Bible salesman.  I realize the point of the film is to chronicle the adverturesome trials and travails of the journey from point A to point B, but the stops along the way just aren't interesting enough to keep you involved.  When the journey concludes, you feel unsatisfied because there wasn't a grand pay-off that justified the time you invested in the film.  The bottom line is that ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is filled with wonderful music and visuals but is frustratingly empty in the substance department.  Clooney, Turturro, and Nelson all give good acting turns but their efforts feel wasted.  When Ulysses Everett McGill yells ""Damn!

534541,A2J0VNTQTQO4R4,B00003CXRM,ToonForever,"[100, 104]","I'm a big fan of the Coen Bros., including Raising Arizona, and esp. Fargo, so I was expecting to enjoy this.What I was not expecting was that I would be absolutely enraptured by it.  I was so enveloped by the sense of place, the razor sharp acting, the constant self-inflicted misfortune, and especially the music.  The music!  What a stunning, skillfully rendered and executed soundtrack.  I didn't realize what I was missing all these years, ignoring bluegrass the way I did.Well, back to the movie.I don't have to repeat all about the movie being based on Homer's Odyssey... oops, just did.  Well, that aside, I spent some time thinking about what touched me and made this so enjoyable, more than nearly every other movie I've ever seen.  I found many things.Of course, the casting is delightful.  Where do you find people who can pull off Clooney's sidekicks the way they did.  If I met John Turturro or Tim Blake Nelson on the street, I would probably be just shocked to find they aren't doltish hillbillies!  John Goodman is a perfect cyclops, in a goofy, ominous, hulkish way, and Christ Thomas King, who I believe is really known for his guitar playing, still plays the understated Tommy Johnson beautifully, as if it makes perfect sense to meet the devil at a crossroads in the middle of nowhere and sell your soul to him for a good dose of guitar skill.  I could go on and on about the cast, but you won't find a sour note in there.  You'll be convinced that none of these people could live anywhere but the Depression ear South.  Before I move on from the cast, something that goes unmentioned a lot, is the brilliant performances by some of the bit players, such as Frank Collison as Wash Hogwallop, Stephen Root as the Radio Station guy, and Millford Fortenberry as the Geographical Oddity storekeeper.  It may seem easy to do a small part for a little time, but this really underscores the Coen Bros. talent for getting a pitch perfect performance from every actor, no matter how small the part.Much has been made of the music... and rightly so!  I suppose it was less than surprising to learn that the music was actually a large part of the genesis of this movie.  You could almost say that this is a musical of sorts, not of the broadway style, but some sort of hybrid, as only the Coen Bros. can do.  My favorite musical moments are probably nearly the same as everyone else's, such as Man of Constant Sorrow.  How can you not just love that song?  The Sirens singing Didnt' Leave Nobody But the Baby with the way they used those rags for their loose-boned and sultry rhythm would certainly be tough to resist :)  O Death at a KKK rally, what a sendup that was!  The horrifying ridiculousness of that strangely choreographed scene was reminiscent of everything from the Nazi's Nuremberg rally to the Wicked Witch's guards from the Wizard of Oz (tell me you don't hear an echo of their ""Oh we love--Noooo one"" at the beginning of that scene.)  But I have to admit I was strangely moved and affected by my favorite scene, Down in the River to Pray, the baptism scene.  There was something beautiful, serene, and noble about those people in white, moving toward a turning point of purity and devotion down to be immersed in their new life.  I loved it, utterly.You may have noticed by this time that I haven't really mentioned Clooney but in passing.  There's a reason for that.  Probably the one thing that most deeply moved me was the character of Ulysses Everett McGill.  Though it's not obvious at first, I think Everett is a beautifully developed, complex character.  As the movie went on, I began to see him as insecure, loaded with good intentions, but without the inner strength to carry them out, full of regrets, yet a slave to his own passions and his desire to be admired.  When we begin to realize that what Everett's looking for is to get his wife back, the whole situation seems just delightfully silly at first.  But underneath, Clooney manages to display McGill's sensitive and wounded heart.  He's terribly insecure and masks his insecurity with too much talk and a know-it-all attitude, as well as his addiction to Dapper Dan and his own appearance.  A very telling scene is in the Geographical Oddity shop, when he obviously wants to tell off the shopkeeper who can't get his car part or his Dapper Dan for two weeks.  He's mad and looks to storm out, but instead he crumbles and buys the pomade and hair nets.  I think a lot of people miss that one.  Everett is lost in a mess of his own making and is desperate to find that one rope strong enough to pull him out of the hole he's in.  I think we all know people, or have one time *been* people who have become mired in their poor decisions and are further derailed by their attempts to circumvent the consequences.  When people like this get that one opportunity to escape their pattern of failure they often miss it, but once in a while they grab hold and make it.  I'll let you see what really happens in the movie, but George Clooney and the Coen Bros. have wrought a beautiful, tragically flawed, yet good and loving at heart protagonist and should be long recognized for it.I cannot recommend this movie enough, aside from what I've mentioned, it is loaded with fun and frolic, good and evil and the strange, enormous grey area in between, tragedy and triumph.  Some of the lines and gags in this movie are priceless and the sort of thing you find yourself saying to friends at odd times just to crack things up (Do - Not - Seek - the Treasssure!)  It bears multiple watchings well, as there are so many little details to pick up on, and its fun to find the direct Odyssey references within, some of them less obvious than others.I'm not sure it's ever been so easy to give a movie five stars.",5,"Come on in, Boys, the Water is Fine...",1138406400,"01 28, 2006",2006,5785,"[""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Coen', 'Bros.', 'including', 'Raising', 'Arizona',

The plot of the movie is that Ulysses ""Everett"" McGill, Pete, and Delmar are three convicts, chained together, who have escaped and are on the run to supposedly fine some loot (1.2 million dollars to be exact) that ""Everett"" buried before he was put in the pen. Along the way they meet a variety of characters from a blind railroad man, a one-eyed Bible salesman, three beautiful sirens washing clothes in the river, and George ""Babyface"" Nelson. Throw in a Klu Klux Klan meeting that starts off in a rousing musical number that seems a cross between a Broadway musical and the flying monkey theme from THE WIZARD OF OZ; a couple of lynch mobs; back-stabbing family members; a prayed for miracle flood of Biblical proportions; and a strange character who seems a lot like the devil and you're in for a toe-stomping, roller coaster ride of a movie filled with humor of all kinds.Many people have criticized the movie because they don't understand what's going on throughout the movie. To begin with, the film is loosely based on Homer's THE ODYSSEY. If you're familiar with that classic piece of literature, you will have a better understanding of the movie and perhaps appreciate it a bit more. But if you aren't familiar with THE ODYSSEY, it really shouldn't make too much of a difference. This is a Coen brother's film and like all of their movies it is quirky, somewhat bizarre, and full of classical and pop cultural references. The humor is on several different levels from visual gags to witty word play.However, not everyone will find the film enjoyable. Nevertheless, this is probably the most audience accessible of all Coen films. It's made in the same sort of style as RAISING ARIZONA and THE HUDSUCKER PROXY and has a ""happy"" ending. The film feels like one is watching an old silent film brought to life and connected together. Not only that, but the movie also has one of the best soundtracks in recent years; the music is a key part of the film.Other than that all I can say is that my brother and I are different as night and day and there aren't very many movies we both enjoy.

Durning ditto as the slummin' southern governor.  Holly Hunter as Penelope doesn't get much screen time, but she makes the most of what she does get.  And then of course there's the music, which is just too good to be true.The only thing that bothered me at all was that the brothers didn't 'bring me along gently' into the style of this particular story.  In Fargo, you don't realize what you're in for till it's too late.  In Raising Arizona the plot has you hooked early enough so you have to put up with the gore.

But, you must have familiarity with The Odyssey, and DEFINITELY have an understanding of the Depression-era rural south, and southern culture in general, in order to appreciate the rich and subtle substance of the film.  If you don't, watching this movie is a poor use of your time.  In direct contradiction to comments from some who apparently fail to meet these criteria: the music is simply marvelous (again, if you enjoy the harmonies and lyrics of bluegrass and folk music), the dialogue (particulary Clooney's part) is witty, and the stereotypes (and allusions to other films) are both necessary and delicious, and clever as well. This is most certainly not a racist film and the point is NOT the 'plot'. Yes, there are a few rough spots and historical inaccuracies. But, they are trivial. This movie is an testament to the talent of the Coens, and far better than Fargo, which had a dark and bizarre side!",5,Outstanding!!!

However, with this movie, this brother team has cemented their reputation as serious and skilled filmmakers with a lot to say and a stylish way of saying it.This movie is a loose retelling of &quot;The Odyssey&quot; by Homer, set in the Depression-era Deep South.  George Clooney, John Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson make an unlikely team of escaped convicts who embark on a journey of the weird and wonderful.  Watch for the appearance of many famous Odyssey allusions, such as the Sirens and the Cyclops (among others).  The Coens' quirky take on this classic tale is delightful and perfectly executed, and the script is beautifully and humorously written.  The sets and filming are artistic and a bit mythical, and the casting choices are just great.  The film is peopled with interesting characters, in classic Coen brothers fashion.  Look for great supporting characters played by John Goodman, Holly Hunter, Charles Durning, and others.And that's not all!  Interwoven in this film are great depression-era songs and some original songs, with excellent music direction by T-bone Burnett.  Who says Moulin Rouge is the first movie in a long while to take the musical format?  This movie is just as much a musical as Baz Luhrmann's much-hyped movie.I really believe that this movie reaches heights that previous Coen brothers movies (even Fargo) haven't reached.  In addition, I believe this movie was slighted by the Academy during Oscar time.  This movie was one of the best films of the year, and excelled in every aspect a film can be awarded for.",5,"A triumph of a movie, thoroughly enjoyable",991612800,"06 4, 2001",2001,1684,"['Coen', 'brothers', 'have', 'cult', 'following', 'saw', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'count', 'masses', 'love', 'Coens', 'However', 'movie', 'brother', 'team', 'cemented', 'reputation', 'serious', 'skilled', 'filmmakers', 'lot', 'say', 'stylish', 'way', 'saying', 'it.This', 'movie', 'loose', 'retelling', 'quot', 'Odyssey', 'quot', 'Homer', 'set', 'Depression-era', 'Deep', 'South', 'George', 'Clooney', 'John', 'Turturro', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'make', 'unlikely', 'team', 'escaped', 'convicts', 'who', 'embark', 'journey', 'weird', 'wonderful', 'Watch', 'appearance', 'many', 'famous', 'Odyssey', 'allusions', 'such', 'Sirens', 'Cyclops', 'others', 'Coens', 'quirky', 'take', 'classic', 'tale', 'delightful', 'perfectly', 'executed', 'script', 'beautifully', 'humorously', 'written', 'sets', 'filming', 'are', 'artistic', 'bit', 'mythical', 'casting', 'choices', 'are', 'just', 'great', 'film', 'peopled', 'interesting', 'characters', 'classic', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'fashion', 'Look', 'great', 'supporting', 'characters', 'played', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'Charles', 'Durning', 'not', 'Interwoven', 'film', 'are', 'great', 'depression-era', 'songs', 'original', 'songs', 'excellent', 'music', 'direction', 'T-bone', 'Burnett', 'Who', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'first', 'movie', 'long', 'while', 'take', 'musical', 'format', 'movie', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'musical', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'much-hyped', 'movie.I', 'really', 'believe', 'movie', 'heights', 'previous', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'movies', 'even', 'Fargo', 'have', ""n't"", 'reached', 'addition', 'believe', 'movie', 'was', 'slighted', 'Academy', 'Oscar', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'excelled', 'aspect', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'awarded']","O Brother, Where Art Thou?"
534558,A1TOML01ZYPUFR,B00003CXRM,"Zachary S. Houp ""RAREfiend""","[4, 6]","This is a rare opportunity, to review a film so entirely enjoyable,  so entertaining beyond my wildest imaginations, funnier than I could have possible expected, yet still without living up to the potential that it undoubtedly possessed.  I've heard--whether or not it is true, I don't know--that the Coen brothers prided themselves on the fact that &quot;this is their interpretation of the Odyssey without ever having actually read it.&quot;  I'm inclined to believe that if they actually HAD read it, they could have constructed a far more diverse spoof that covered some of the more absurd and interesting adventures of Homer's tale.  But, regardless, whether they did or not I cannot say anything but that this film is one of the most entertaining I've ever had the pleasure to witness.And thus, this film becomes somewhat of a paradox, because there is a lot for me to criticize.  Admittedly, Homer doesn't follow an ongoing plot too closely; he seemed content to get his hero home and with his wife.  The Coen brothers, however, take this neglegable attention to plot to an even greater extent however, as it follows more traditional road trip, buddy comedies by interspersed adventures that have relatively no bearing on future events or occurances.  I have to imagine that they could have weaved a much more integrated tale, combining their elements more comprehensively into a geniune story--or at least something resembling it.  For this reason, by the film's conclusion I find myself somewhat unsatisfied, as I know the potential was always there, but never executed to the degree that such a promising idea should have been.But still, beyond that, I was entertained.  As is expected from the Coen brothers, they somehow dredge of the greatest characters ever to grace the screen: always just craziest enough to represent some guy that you know.  The acting is superb, especially leads George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Turturro.  Meanwhile, as the stories &quot;plot&quot; takes our protagonists from hilarious situation to hilarious situation, the film just keeps getting funnier and funnier, entertaining in new and obscure ways that one might have never thought imaginable.So, to summarize this film, it is perhaps the funniest and most entertaining movie that ever succeeded despite its blatently apparent lack of overall cohesion.  If you can overlook something negligable like cosistancy--as I most certainly did--then you will no doubt learn to love this film for all of its humorous situations, idiosyncratic characters, and--yes--even its faults: indeed they are big, but of little consequence when you find yourself so wholly enjoying the film before you.  I'll admittedly leave off with the comment that this isn't the Coen brothers' best, but even after adding it to their repotoire, cannot be deemed in any way &quot;bad.&quot;  They are two of the greatest filmmakers in Hollywood, and if this movie can prove that even one of their lesser pictures still exceeds almost everything else offered, then it stands as a testament to their ability and genius.",4,"Funny, Funny, Pointless, and Funny",1007683200,"12 7, 2001",2001,3089,"['rare', 'opportunity', 'review', 'film', 'so', 'entirely', 'enjoyable', 'so', 'entertaining', 'wildest', 'imaginations', 'funnier', 'could', 'have', 'possible', 'expected', 'yet', 'still', 'living', 'up', 'potential', 'undoubtedly', 'possessed', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'not', 'true', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'prided', 'fact', 'quot', 'interpretation', 'Odyssey', 'ever', 'having', 'actually', 'read', 'it.', 'quot', ""'m"", 'inclined', 'believe', 'actually', 'HAD', 'read', 'could', 'have', 'constructed', 'far', 'more', 'diverse', 'spoof', 'covered', 'more', 'absurd', 'interesting', 'adventures', 'Homer', 'tale', 'regardless', 'did', 'not', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'anything', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'pleasure', 'witness.And', 'thus', 'film', 'somewhat', 'paradox', 'lot', 'criticize', 'Admittedly', 'Homer', ""n't"", 'follow', 'ongoing', 'plot', 'too', 'closely', 'seemed', 'content', 'get', 'hero', 'home', 'wife', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'however', 'take', 'neglegable', 'attention', 'plot', 'even', 'greater', 'extent', 'however', 'more', 'traditional', 'road', 'trip', 'buddy', 'comedies', 'interspersed', 'adventures', 'have', 'relatively', 'bearing', 'future', 'events', 'occurances', 'have', 'imagine', 'could', 'have', 'weaved', 'much', 'more', 'integrated', 'tale', 'combining', 'elements', 'more', 'comprehensively', 'geniune', 'story', 'least', 'something', 'resembling', 'reason', 'film', 'conclusion', 'find', 'somewhat', 'unsatisfied', 'know', 'potential', 'was', 'always', 'there', 'never', 'executed', 'degree', 'promising', 'idea', 'should', 'have', 'been.But', 'still', 'was', 'entertained', 'expected', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'somehow', 'dredge', 'greatest', 'characters', 'ever', 'grace', 'screen', 'always', 'just', 'craziest', 'enough', 'represent', 'guy', 'know', 'acting', 'superb', 'especially', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'John', 'Turturro', 'Meanwhile', 'stories', 'quot', 'plot', 'quot', 'protagonists', 'hilarious', 'situation', 'hilarious', 'situation', 'film', 'just', 'getting', 'funnier', 'funnier', 'entertaining', 'new', 'obscure', 'ways', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'never', 'thought', 'imaginable.So', 'summarize', 'film', 'perhaps', 'funniest', 'most', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'ever', 'succeeded', 'blatently', 'apparent', 'lack', 'overall', 'cohesion', 'can', 'overlook', 'something', 'negligable', 'like', 'cosistancy', 'most', 'certainly', 'did', 'then', 'will', 'doubt', 'learn', 'love', 'film', 'humorous', 'situations', 'idiosyncratic', 'characters', 'yes', 'even', 'faults', 'indeed', 'are', 'big', 'little', 'consequence', 'when', 'find', 'so', 'wholly', 'enjoying', 'film', ""'ll"", 'admittedly', 'leave', 'off', 'comment', ""n't"", 'Coen', 'brothers', 'best', 'even', 'adding', 'repotoire', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'deemed', 'way', 'quot', 'quot', 'are', 'two', 'greatest', 'filmmakers', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'can', 'prove', 'even', 'one', 'lesser', 'pictures', 'still', 'almost', 'everything', 'else', 'offered', 'then', 'testament', 'ability', 'genius']","O Brother, Where Art Thou?"
