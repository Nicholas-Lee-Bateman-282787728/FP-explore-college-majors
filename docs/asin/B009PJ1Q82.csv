Thought it deserved a lot more than **1/2  but obviously this film isn't going to appeal to all tastes. In my opinion though, this film is an absorbing study of a difficult ten year relationship between two very flawed characters.  The acting was exemplary, especially by Thure Lindhardt as Erik;  this surely is his breakthrough role as an actor.  I found him and his performance absolutely fascinating to watch; even his audition tape (one of the many fine extras on the DVD) was fun to watch.  Found the sexual tensions between Erik and Paul and their various peccadillos were handled with honesty and realism by director Ira Sachs.  Perhaps a bit slow at times but overall this excellent Bergman-style film deserves a wide and appreciative audience.",5,EXCELLENT STUDY OF A DIFFICULT RELATIONSHIP,1391990400,"02 10, 2014",2014,874,"['watched', 'twice', 'giving', 'rating', 'mainly', 'reading', 'fairly', 'negative', 'review', 'Maltin', 'Movie', 'Guide', 'Thought', 'deserved', 'lot', 'more', '**1/2', 'obviously', 'film', ""n't"", 'going', 'appeal', 'tastes', 'opinion', 'film', 'absorbing', 'study', 'difficult', 'ten', 'year', 'relationship', 'two', 'very', 'flawed', 'characters', 'acting', 'was', 'exemplary', 'especially', 'Thure', 'Lindhardt', 'Erik', 'surely', 'breakthrough', 'role', 'actor', 'found', 'performance', 'absolutely', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'even', 'audition', 'tape', 'one', 'many', 'fine', 'extras', 'DVD', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'sexual', 'tensions', 'Erik', 'Paul', 'various', 'peccadillos', 'were', 'handled', 'honesty', 'realism', 'director', 'Ira', 'Sachs', 'Perhaps', 'bit', 'slow', 'times', 'overall', 'excellent', 'Bergman-style', 'film', 'wide', 'appreciative', 'audience']",N/A

1601177,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B009PJ1Q82,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[7, 8]","It's NYC in the late 1990's, where Erik (Thure Lindhardt) is a budding filmmaker from Denmark, supported by his family while working on a documentary for the past four years. While trolling for sex on a phone line, he meets Paul (Zachary Booth), and closeted attorney for a publisher, they discover a sexual and emotional connection, and eventually move in together. Erik is aware, early on, that Paul smokes crack cocaine, but is unaware of how his addiction is growing, to the point where he eventually disappears from his job and their apartment. They manage to stay together for close to a decade, despite Paul's stints in rehab and subsequent failures to maintain his sobriety. Erik sees Paul's failures as a reflection of his own inability to follow-through on things (like his film), and becomes obsessed with ""saving"" Paul, despite friends' advice and common sense telling him it just may not happen, despite his best efforts and intentions.Based loosely on a personal experience by the movie's director/co-writer, Ira Sacks, the film's subject matter is obviously rather dark and depressing at times, though realistic for someone going through a rather masochistic relationship with an addict. The acting and technical quality are first rate, although the film's pacing seems to bog down at times, suggesting that more editing would have been an improvement. Film is unrated (would be an R for sexual content, though no complete nudity), and appeared in several film festivals (including Sundance). DVD extras include ""Making of"" short, deleted scenes, commentary and auditions. Although this film has gotten a lot of attention, I didn't find it that impressive, and am being generous with three stars out of five.",3,"Dark story of one flawed individual trying to ""save"" another.",1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,1723,"['NYC', 'late', '1990', 'where', 'Erik', 'Thure', 'Lindhardt', 'budding', 'filmmaker', 'Denmark', 'supported', 'family', 'working', 'documentary', 'past', 'four', 'years', 'trolling', 'sex', 'phone', 'line', 'Paul', 'Zachary', 'Booth', 'closeted', 'attorney', 'publisher', 'discover', 'sexual', 'emotional', 'connection', 'eventually', 'move', 'together', 'Erik', 'aware', 'early', 'Paul', 'crack', 'cocaine', 'unaware', 'how', 'addiction', 'growing', 'point', 'where', 'eventually', 'job', 'apartment', 'manage', 'stay', 'together', 'close', 'decade', 'Paul', 'stints', 'rehab', 'subsequent', 'failures', 'maintain', 'sobriety', 'Erik', 'Paul', 'failures', 'reflection', 'own', 'inability', 'follow-through', 'things', 'film', 'becomes', 'obsessed', 'saving', 'Paul', 'friends', 'advice', 'common', 'sense', 'telling', 'just', 'may', 'not', 'happen', 'best', 'efforts', 'intentions.Based', 'loosely', 'personal', 'experience', 'movie', 'director/co-writer', 'Ira', 'Sacks', 'film', 'subject', 'matter', 'obviously', 'rather', 'dark', 'depressing', 'times', 'realistic', 'someone', 'going', 'rather', 'masochistic', 'relationship', 'addict', 'acting', 'technical', 'quality', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'film', 'pacing', 'bog', 'down', 'times', 'suggesting', 'more', 'editing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'improvement', 'Film', 'unrated', 'would', 'be', 'R', 'sexual', 'content', 'complete', 'nudity', 'appeared', 'several', 'film', 'festivals', 'including', 'Sundance', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'Making', 'short', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'auditions', 'film', 'gotten', 'lot', 'attention', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'impressive', 'am', 'being', 'generous', 'three', 'stars', 'five']",N/A

As I watched the movie, I kept hoping it wouldn't did any deeper into a well of isolation, abuse and co-dependency, but it just kept going deeper.  While many can relate to some level of difficulty in a relationship, this throws so many issues into the mix, you can't help but ask why either one of the characters stay?  It is an essay in co-dependent relationships, and that is the only redeeming value in the film.  I couldn't connect with either of the two main characters, which didn't help the plight of the film.  On one hand, you have Erik, an aspiring artist / filmmaker who is somewhat sex addicted and completely dependent upon his lover Paul.  To the extent he watches as Paul has sex with a stranger while high on drugs.  Paul is identified as an attorney, who has a drug addiction and falls off the wagon after going for treatment in Minnesota.While the topics are relevant to some, the acting was not superb, and the film is a dark abyss of chaos and abuse.

Nothing particularly new or interesting happens here.  The story is pretty disjointed and the editing is odd as you never know where you are in the story.

Paul, played by Zachary Booth, is a lawyer, drug addict, and uncontrollable wreck. Erik naively believes he can help him, but we all know how it will turn out.So we have the set up for Ira Sachs' drama ""Keep the lights on."" A film that isn't solely about gay relationships, but about just plain bad ones. And boy what a bad one Paul and Erik have. It would be easy to say that protagonists Paul and Erik have a broken romance, but when was it ever fixed? Even from the beginning something isn't quite right about their chemistry. They seem aloof from one another, yet there's a negative electricity holding them together. Erik meets other people who would offer a much nicer relationship, but he remains apprehensive to follow. Lights' is memorable for its  performances from Booth and Lindhardt. They are both fascinating to watch. True, they don't have much chemistry, but I think that's What makes their relationship so intriguing. We never truly know what draws these two together, yet the ambiguity allows food for thought.Stylistically, Lights is similar to Andrew Haigh's exceptional film ""Weekend,"" which came out a few years ago. Though Haighs' film has a far more lighthearted plot than Lights, both films invite us to inhabit similar worlds of intimacy where sex and drugs are the common time-passer.Lights remains for me an abstract yet effective piece of work. The film jumps ahead 3-5 years in Paul and Erik's  relationship,  and we aren't clued in to every detail or event that happened between these years. We are left to fill in the blanks on are one.

Erik has just broken up with his lover and compulsively seeks out physical encounters with other gay men, using phone hot-lines (the film begins in 1998, at the time when phone hot-lines were beginning to be phased out, due to the rising popularity of the internet).Mr. Sachs holds little back in depicting the sexual encounters Erik has with strangers as well as his new found lover, Paul, a literary agent. They're not completely explicit but there's a raw immediacy, which gives the film an authentic verisimilitude--a peek at gay life that outsiders rarely are privy to.Sachs wisely chronicles the dichotomy of Erik's personality. On one hand, he's almost irrational in his obsession with Paul, ignoring the obvious reality that Paul is a drug addict and is rapidly going downhill. Erik also keeps a lot of things to himself and there is a lack of communication between the two lovers (that lack of transparency that Sachs alluded to during the recent screening I attended). On the plus side, Erik is deeply concerned about Paul's welfare and is instrumental in getting him into an inpatient program.While Paul has to struggle with his demons, Erik gradually makes good on his promise to become a successful documentary filmmaker. He wins a 'Teddy' Award in Berlin, after garnering acclaim for his documentary about a gay artist from the 40s and 50s, who Erik in effect, rescues from obscurity.The tension in the plot is bound up in guessing whether Paul is going to make it or not. After Paul returns from rehab, there's a great scene where he disappears for a number of days, and Erik and his friends have no idea where he is. When Erik finally finds him at a hotel, it's obvious that he's had a bad relapse. Erik hardly seems surprised when a young man comes over to have sex with Paul. Instead of getting angry and feeling betrayed, he accepts the fact that Paul has relapsed and holds his hand while Paul has casual sex with the stranger.'Keep the Lights On' slows down considerably in the third act, as Paul seemingly is much better after a few years and is now able to work. Erik's attitude has changed toward Paul, who has kept away from him for about a year. When Paul gives him an ultimatum--either break up or find a new home and live together--Erik, perhaps now realizing that their relationship has run its course, chooses the option of dissolution.Erik's obsessive love for Paul does eventually become tiresome and of course the point is that Erik must go through a process of self-actualization before he realizes he's been in a masochistic relationship. Nonetheless, Paul's breakdown and Erik's efforts to help him, is the best part of the picture. And yes we also want to know what the ultimate disposition is of their relationship.Director Sachs' portrait of Erik is of a gay man who is not isolated from the rest of society. He has female friends and well as straight male friends, and despite flights of sexual compulsivity, Erik comes off as someone who is pretty much part of the mainstream. In that respect, Mr. Sachs ably argues that gay people should not be considered 'outsiders', but ordinary people, who are no different than the average middle class straight person.A good part of 'Keep the Lights On' is strangely compelling. Will Paul overcome his addiction? Can Erik remain in the relationship, despite Paul's chequered history? Erik's 'love at any cost' obsession with Paul is necessary to show his self-destructiveness but by the same token, remains unexplained and goes on for a little too long. Some judicious editing, to make the film slightly shorter, would have helped. Nonetheless, this is a film that is definitely worth a look, not only for a few nice twists and turns in the plot, but the particularly strong performances from Thure Lindhardt and Zachary Booth, as the gay lovers, whose relationship reaches its nadir and then unceremoniously, fizzles out!",3,Tale of Gay lover's efforts to save drug-addicted partner trumps his one-note obsession with him,1359072000,"01 25, 2013",2013,4462,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'attending', 'recent', 'screening', 'Lights', 'director', 'Ira', 'Sachs', 'indicated', 'title', 'new', 'film', 'gay', 'romance', 'spanning', 'approximately', 'ten', 'years', 'refers', 'transparency', 'lack', 'thereof', 'additional', 'theme', 'revealed', 'characters', 'are', 'trapped', 'masochistic', 'relationship.The', 'film', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'Erik', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'Denmark', 'basically', 'supported', 'father', 'much', 'chagrin', 'sister', 'who', 'not', 'having', 'regular', 'job', 'Erik', 'just', 'broken', 'up', 'lover', 'compulsively', 'out', 'physical', 'encounters', 'other', 'gay', 'men', 'using', 'phone', 'hot-lines', 'film', '1998', 'time', 'when', 'phone', 'hot-lines', 'were', 'beginning', 'be', 'phased', 'out', 'due', 'rising', 'popularity', 'internet', '.Mr', 'Sachs', 'little', 'back', 'depicting', 'sexual', 'encounters', 'Erik', 'strangers', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'found', 'lover', 'Paul', 'literary', 'agent', ""'re"", 'not', 'completely', 'explicit', 'raw', 'immediacy', 'film', 'authentic', 'verisimilitude', 'peek', 'gay', 'life', 'outsiders', 'rarely', 'are', 'privy', 'to.Sachs', 'wisely', 'dichotomy', 'Erik', 'personality', 'one', 'hand', 'almost', 'irrational', 'obsession', 'Paul', 'ignoring', 'obvious', 'reality', 'Paul', 'drug', 'addict', 'rapidly', 'going', 'downhill', 'Erik', 'also', 'lot', 'things', 'lack', 'communication', 'two', 'lovers', 'lack', 'transparency', 'Sachs', 'alluded', 'recent', 'screening', 'attended', 'plus', 'side', 'Erik', 'deeply', 'concerned', 'Paul', 'welfare', 'instrumental', 'getting', 'inpatient', 'program.While', 'Paul', 'struggle', 'demons', 'Erik', 'gradually', 'good', 'promise', 'become', 'successful', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', ""'Teddy"", 'Award', 'Berlin', 'garnering', 'acclaim', 'documentary', 'gay', 'artist', '40s', '50s', 'who', 'Erik', 'effect', 'rescues', 'obscurity.The', 'tension', 'plot', 'bound', 'up', 'guessing', 'Paul', 'going', 'make', 'not', 'Paul', 'returns', 'rehab', 'great', 'scene', 'where', 'number', 'days', 'Erik', 'friends', 'have', 'idea', 'where', 'When', 'Erik', 'finally', 'hotel', 'obvious', 'had', 'bad', 'relapse', 'Erik', 'hardly', 'surprised', 'when', 'young', 'man', 'have', 'sex', 'Paul', 'Instead', 'getting', 'angry', 'feeling', 'betrayed', 'fact', 'Paul', 'relapsed', 'hand', 'Paul', 'casual', 'sex', 'stranger', ""'Keep"", 'Lights', 'slows', 'down', 'considerably', 'third', 'act', 'Paul', 'seemingly', 'much', 'better', 'few', 'years', 'now', 'able', 'work', 'Erik', 'attitude', 'changed', 'Paul', 'who', 'kept', 'away', 'year', 'When', 'Paul', 'ultimatum', 'break', 'up', 'find', 'new', 'home', 'live', 'together', 'Erik', 'perhaps', 'now', 'realizing', 'relationship', 'run', 'course', 'option', 'dissolution.Erik', 'obsessive', 'love', 'Paul', 'eventually', 'become', 'tiresome', 'course', 'point', 'Erik', 'must', 'go', 'process', 'self-actualization', 'been', 'masochistic', 'relationship', 'Nonetheless', 'Paul', 'breakdown', 'Erik', 'efforts', 'help', 'best', 'part', 'picture', 'yes', 'also', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'ultimate', 'disposition', 'relationship.Director', 'Sachs', 'portrait', 'Erik', 'gay', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'isolated', 'rest', 'society', 'female', 'friends', 'well', 'straight', 'male', 'friends', 'flights', 'sexual', 'compulsivity', 'Erik', 'off', 'someone', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'part', 'mainstream', 'respect', 'Mr.', 'Sachs', 'ably', 'gay', 'people', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'considered', ""'outsiders"", 'ordinary', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'different', 'average', 'middle', 'class', 'straight', 'person.A', 'good', 'part', 'Lights', 'strangely', 'compelling', 'Will', 'Paul', 'overcome', 'addiction', 'Can', 'Erik', 'remain', 'relationship', 'Paul', 'chequered', 'history', 'Erik', ""'love"", 'cost', 'obsession', 'Paul', 'necessary', 'show', 'self-destructiveness', 'same', 'token', 'unexplained', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'judicious', 'editing', 'make', 'film', 'slightly', 'shorter', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'Nonetheless', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'look', 'not', 'only', 'few', 'nice', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'particularly', 'strong', 'performances', 'Thure', 'Lindhardt', 'Zachary', 'Booth', 'gay', 'lovers', 'relationship', 'nadir', 'then', 'unceremoniously', 'out']",N/A
