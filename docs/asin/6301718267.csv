Karl Ehrlich (John Wayne) is the German captain of a tramp steamer in an Australian harbor. Cmd. Jeff Napier an old friend is showing off his new fianc&eacute;e Elsa Keller (Lana Turner). From their eye movement it looks as though the captain and Elsa know each other. When the commander steps out, Karl confronts Elsa with her past and sends her packing.Things heat up pretty fast from here. Even though the captain is an old naval officer he was dismissed when he opposed the Nazi r&eacute;gime. But he is still a German nationalist. With the invasion of Poland Australia is dragged into the war leavening Karl with only a small chance of sneaking the ship out in the fog. At the last minute the German Consulate hands him one of their best agents (spies). One guess as to who that agent may be.Now the chase is on and Cmd. Jeff Napier has a professional and personal reason to track down Karl before he reaches Germany.The real story is that of the action between the different members of the crew. The nature of the agent adds complications to the voyage. And there is a conflict of morals aboard.Will Capt. Karl Ehrlich make it home?Or will Cmd. Jeff Napier blow him out of the water?What becomes of Elsa?""What flag is that sir?

At the outbreak of WWII, German warship veteran Captain Karl Ehrlich (John Wayne), his ship Ergenstrasse and it's crew are stuck in Australia, under the thumb of the British government.  Despite being a staunch enemy of the Nazi party, Ehrlich decides the only option is to return the ship to Germany, so his men can decide their own fates.  Under the thick fog of Sydney Harbour, the Ergenstrasse sets off on it's final perilous voyage...Lana Turner enlivens the proceedings, playing Capt. Ehrlich's passenger, spy Elsa Keller.

Top that by casting John Wayne in the role, and it's truly a revolutionary move.""The Sea Chase"" retells the story of the German freighter Erlangen that tried to elude Allied naval ships at the beginning of WW 2 in an attempt to go from New Zealand back to the safety of German waters. The film stars John Wayne and Lana Turner with a great supporting cast that includes Lyle Bettger, Tab Hunter, Alan Hale Jr., David Farrar, Claude Akins and John Wayne regulars like James Arness, Paul Fix, and John Qualen.Sultry Lana Turner (1921-95) is best remembered for her roles in ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (1946), ""The Bad and the Beautiful"" (1952), and ""Imitation of Life"" (1959), although it's her performance in ""Peyton Place"" (1957) for which she received her only Oscar nomination. Turner plays a German spy who catches a ride on Wayne's boat. Known as ""the Sweater Girl"", she manages to do a few scenes wearing one.David Farrar (1908-95) plays the British officer in charge of the chase, and Turner's fianc&eacute;. He made more than 50 films, many of them war films (""Pursuit of the Graf Spee"", ""Escape to Burma""). He played the Pharaoh in ""Solomon and Sheba"" (1959) and Xerxes in ""The 300 Spartans"" (1962).Lyle Bettger (1915-2003) plays an ardent Nazi. He often played a smirking well dressed villain in films like ""Union Station"" (1950) and ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" (1952).Alan Hale Jr. (1921-90) is best known as ""the skipper"" from the TV series ""Gilligan's Island."" He made more than 100 films, starting in 1933. Hale served in the Coast Guard in WW 2.Tough Claude Akins (1926-94) is best remembered as Sheriff Lobo from the TV series ""BJ and the Bear"" (1978-81), but he appeared in more than 100 films and as many TV programs.James Arness  (1923) was Marshall Dillon on TV's ""Gunsmoke"" (1955 to 1975). Arness  got his big break from John Wayne who cast him in four films in the early 50s. In fact, the original role as Marshall Dillon was offered to Wayne who turned it down and suggested Arness.Paul Fix (1901-83) played in more than 200 films, many of them westerns, starting in the silent film era. He gave us such memorable roles as old man Maxwell in ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" (1973), and Joan Crawford's confidant Eddie in ""Johnny Guitar"" (1954). He's best remembered for his role as the Marshall in Sam Peckinpah's TV series ""The Rifleman"" (1958-65).John Qualen (1899-1987) made nearly 200 films, 9 of them directed by John Ford and 4 with Wayne but not Ford - ""The High and the Mighty"" (1954), ""North to Alaska (1960), ""Donovan's Reef"" (1963) and this film. My favorite John Qualen role was as Lars in ""The Searchers"" (1956).Director John Farrow (1904-63) was the father of actress Mia Farrow with Margaret O'Sullivan (Jane from the Tarzan films). Farrow was twice nominated for an Oscar, winning for ""Around the World in 80 Days"" (1956) and nominated for ""Wake Island"" (1942).William Clothier (1903-96) is the cinematographer. Clothier and Wayne worked together on several  films, including  ""Fort Apache"" (1948), ""The Horse Soldiers"" (1959), ""Liberty Valance"" (1962), and ""Donovan's Reef"" (1963).  Clothier was nominated for two Oscars - ""The Alamo"" (1960) and ""Cheyenne Autumn"" (1964). Clothier's motto was ""anything for a shot""""The Sea Chase"" came in at #9 in top grossing films in 1955. . ""Lady and the Tramp"", ""Mister Roberts"", Guys and Dolls"", ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and ""Picnic"" were the top 5. The Oscars went to ""Marty"" (Picture, Director, Actor), ""Mister Roberts"" (Supporting Actor), ""East of Eden"" (Supporting Actress), and ""The Rose Tatoo"" (Actress).When most people think about John Wayne, they think about his westerns and his war films. But there's a small group of Wayne films, like ""The Quiet Man"" (1952), ""The High and the Mighty"" (1954), along with this film, in which Wayne gave some of his most memorable performances. These came along at a time when Wayne was trying to start his own production company, Batjac, and I think that made him a better actor in the films he was doing for others.This is a really good film with one of Wayne's best performances.",4,Wayne shines and he's not a Cowboy nor a Marine,1305590400,"05 17, 2011",2011,4348,"['1955', 'were', 'still', 'making', 'traditional', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'films', 'World', 'War', '2', 'e.g.', 'Battle', 'Cry', 'Colditz', 'Story', 'Hell', 'Back', 'so', 'film', 'German', 'naval', 'officer', 'who', 'anti-Nazi', 'sympathetic', 'was', 'bold', 'move', 'Top', 'casting', 'John', 'Wayne', 'role', 'truly', 'revolutionary', 'move', 'Sea', 'Chase', 'story', 'German', 'freighter', 'Erlangen', 'tried', 'elude', 'Allied', 'naval', 'ships', 'beginning', 'WW', '2', 'attempt', 'go', 'New', 'Zealand', 'back', 'safety', 'German', 'waters', 'film', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Lyle', 'Bettger', 'Tab', 'Hunter', 'Alan', 'Hale', 'Jr.', 'David', 'Farrar', 'Claude', 'Akins', 'John', 'Wayne', 'regulars', 'James', 'Arness', 'Paul', 'Fix', 'John', 'Qualen.Sultry', 'Lana', 'Turner', '1921-95', 'best', 'remembered', 'roles', 'Postman', 'Always', 'Rings', 'Twice', '1946', 'Bad', 'Beautiful', '1952', 'Imitation', 'Life', '1959', 'performance', 'Peyton', 'Place', '1957', 'received', 'only', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Turner', 'German', 'spy', 'who', 'ride', 'Wayne', 'boat', 'Known', 'Sweater', 'Girl', 'do', 'few', 'scenes', 'wearing', 'one.David', 'Farrar', '1908-95', 'British', 'officer', 'charge', 'chase', 'Turner', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'made', 'more', '50', 'films', 'many', 'war', 'films', 'Pursuit', 'Graf', 'Spee', 'Escape', 'Burma', 'played', 'Pharaoh', 'Solomon', 'Sheba', '1959', 'Xerxes', '300', 'Spartans', '1962', '.Lyle', 'Bettger', '1915-2003', 'ardent', 'Nazi', 'often', 'played', 'smirking', 'well', 'dressed', 'villain', 'films', 'Union', 'Station', '1950', 'Greatest', 'Show', 'Earth', '1952', '.Alan', 'Hale', 'Jr.', '1921-90', 'best', 'known', 'skipper', 'TV', 'series', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'made', 'more', '100', 'films', 'starting', '1933', 'Hale', 'served', 'Coast', 'Guard', 'WW', '2.Tough', 'Claude', 'Akins', '1926-94', 'best', 'remembered', 'Sheriff', 'Lobo', 'TV', 'series', 'BJ', 'Bear', '1978-81', 'appeared', 'more', '100', 'films', 'many', 'TV', 'programs.James', 'Arness', '1923', 'was', 'Marshall', 'Dillon', 'TV', 'Gunsmoke', '1955', '1975', 'Arness', 'got', 'big', 'break', 'John', 'Wayne', 'who', 'cast', 'four', 'films', 'early', '50s', 'fact', 'original', 'role', 'Marshall', 'Dillon', 'was', 'offered', 'Wayne', 'who', 'turned', 'down', 'suggested', 'Arness.Paul', 'Fix', '1901-83', 'played', 'more', '200', 'films', 'many', 'westerns', 'starting', 'silent', 'film', 'era', 'gave', 'such', 'memorable', 'roles', 'old', 'man', 'Maxwell', 'Pat', 'Garrett', 'Billy', 'Kid', '1973', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'confidant', 'Eddie', 'Johnny', 'Guitar', '1954', 'best', 'remembered', 'role', 'Marshall', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'TV', 'series', 'Rifleman', '1958-65', '.John', 'Qualen', '1899-1987', 'made', 'nearly', '200', 'films', '9', 'directed', 'John', 'Ford', '4', 'Wayne', 'not', 'Ford', 'High', 'Mighty', '1954', 'North', 'Alaska', '1960', 'Donovan', 'Reef', '1963', 'film', 'favorite', 'John', 'Qualen', 'role', 'was', 'Lars', 'Searchers', '1956', '.Director', 'John', 'Farrow', '1904-63', 'was', 'father', 'actress', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'Margaret', ""O'Sullivan"", 'Jane', 'Tarzan', 'films', 'Farrow', 'was', 'twice', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'World', '80', 'Days', '1956', 'nominated', 'Wake', 'Island', '1942', '.William', 'Clothier', '1903-96', 'cinematographer', 'Clothier', 'Wayne', 'worked', 'together', 'several', 'films', 'including', 'Fort', 'Apache', '1948', 'Horse', 'Soldiers', '1959', 'Liberty', 'Valance', '1962', 'Donovan', 'Reef', '1963', 'Clothier', 'was', 'nominated', 'two', 'Oscars', 'Alamo', '1960', 'Cheyenne', 'Autumn', '1964', 'Clothier', 'motto', 'was', 'anything', 'shot', 'Sea', 'Chase', 'came', '9', 'top', 'grossing', 'films', '1955.', 'Lady', 'Tramp', 'Mister', 'Roberts', 'Guys', 'Dolls', 'Rebel', 'Cause', 'Picnic', 'were', 'top', '5', 'Oscars', 'went', 'Marty', 'Picture', 'Director', 'Actor', 'Mister', 'Roberts', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'East', 'Eden', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Rose', 'Tatoo', 'Actress', 'most', 'people', 'think', 'John', 'Wayne', 'think', 'westerns', 'war', 'films', 'small', 'group', 'Wayne', 'films', 'Quiet', 'Man', '1952', 'High', 'Mighty', '1954', 'film', 'Wayne', 'gave', 'most', 'memorable', 'performances', 'came', 'along', 'time', 'when', 'Wayne', 'was', 'trying', 'start', 'own', 'production', 'company', 'Batjac', 'think', 'made', 'better', 'actor', 'films', 'was', 'doing', 'others.This', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'one', 'Wayne', 'best', 'performances']",N/A

263128,A7Y6AVS576M03,6301718267,gobirds2,"[4, 4]","I found this to be one of John Wayne's more interesting and complex roles. In fact the entire film is a complex vortex of emotions and loyalties. As unusual as it seems to have John Wayne playing Captain Karl Erlich of a German cargo ship escaping Australia at the outbreak of WWII, this film works convincingly and quite admirably. Wayne as Captain Erlich is not a Nazi but just a man wanting to return his ship and crew home safely to Germany. Playing his counterpart and conscience throughout is David Farrar as British Commander Napier. Once Wayne's friend, Farrar pursues the cargo ship in a race to cut her off from reaching homeport. David Farrar also serves as narrator of this tale and curiously brings the frustrations of conflicting friendships, duties and political loyalties to the forefront. We never truly accept Wayne as a German but he convincingly plays a worldly, seasoned and inelegant Captain whose honor, reputation and dedication to his crew and ship are beyond question. At the heart of this film is a great maritime adventure beautifully photographed by William Clothier and skillfully directed by John Farrow. The unheralded Roy Webb composed another effective score going above and beyond. The cast is quite impressive.

He plays a loyal German sea captain during the opening days of World War II and does so in a distinctly sympathetic fashion. This may at first seem counterintuitive for John Wayne fans but the key is that he is not a Nazi. In fact, he is an outspoken critic of the Nazi party. That is how he finds himself cashiered from the German navy and in command of a tramp steamer.The captain finds himself in Australia at the outbreak of the war. He breaks out in an attempt to bring his ship safely back to Germany. Though he loathes the regime, he is a loyal German. Getting to Germany is only the least of his problems. He is saddled by his consulate with the transport of a German spy in the form of Femme Fatale, Lana Turner. To make matters worse, his second officer is an ardent Nazi who thinks nothing of committing the occasional atrocity against shipwrecked seamen. The icing on the cake is the Royal Navy warship that pursues him across the South Pacific with an old family friend aboard her as one of the officers.Throughout the entire ordeal, Wayne portrays the captain as a man dedicated to his own ideals and his own conception of valor. This makes dealing with Nazis, spies, mutinous crewmen and friend in the opposing navy just that much more difficult.Wayne is often criticized for playing the same one dimensional character over and over again. I see him as playing parts he believes in over and over again. He generally does a good job of it and this film is no exception.

There is a long sequence when the ship, low on fuel, stops at a tropical isle to cut down trees to procure wood for hungry boilers. This sequence is filmed at Kealakekua bay, on the island of Hawaii.

In the weeks leading up to the blitzkrieg in Poland, German captain Karl Ehrlich and his rusty old freighter, the Ergenstrasse, are in port in Sydney, Australia.  When the war officially starts, Ehrlich decides to make a break for it, but not before he receives orders to transport a German spy to safety.  The Ergenstrasse must run a gauntlet of British ships while also battling dwindling fuel and supplies and a crew that is on the verge of a mutiny.  Can Ehrlich lead his ship to safety and hopefully a German port?  The setting of the South Pacific so early in the war gives this movie a very unique feel, especially because it deals with Germans and British.  It's an exciting movie, and a good-looking movie at that, beautifully filmed in the Pacific.  The movie was filmed on the ocean too, not cheap, cheesy-looking sets, which helps a lot.  Definitely worth a watch for a different type of WWII action/adventure movie!In a role different from many of his other roles, John Wayne is Capt. Karl Ehrlich, a German captain loyal to his country but completely against Nazism and all it stands for.  Wayne is excellent as a man just trying to get the job done no matter the cost.  Lana Turner plays the romantic interest, Elsa Keller, a beautiful German spy on the Ergenstrasse trying to reach safety.  Wayne and Turner's scenes together work pretty well and don't seem forced.  David Farrar plays Jeff Napier, a British officer pursuing the Ergenstrasse who is old friends with Ehrling. Lyle Bettger is very slimy as Kirchner, one of Ehrlich's men completely loyal to the Nazi party and always trying to undermine his captain.  Tab Hunter has a small part as Wesser, a young officer learning the ropes.  The excellent supporting cast is full of great character actors led by James Arness, Paul Fix, John Qualen, Dick Davalos, Alan Hale JR, Peter Whitney, John Doucette, Claude Akins, and Adam Williams.The DVD offers a gorgeous widescreen presentation that shows off the filming locations in and around Hawaii.  The movie's never looked better.  A trailer for The Sea Chase leads a trailer gallery of John Wayne movies, seven of them in all.  This isn't the Duke's most well-known movie, but it's a good one either way.

There is very little Hollywood type glamor nonsense except for Lana Turner being impeccably coiffed, made up and wearing unrumpled clothes. This would never occur in real life aboard a run down tramp ship.The way the crew reacted to a lone woman was perfect. I've seen the same thing on construction sites and other places where everyone was male and a lone woman apears. The men all act as it they hadn't seen a woman in years.I felt that John Wayne and Lana Turner should have been coached in German type accents and body language.
