371485,A314CAGOWSJY6,6303386423,Amazon Customer,"[30, 32]","This is a very long film. I saw the DVD version, purchased new from Amazon,  which probably was a transfer. The quality is not bad - better than a VHS tape but not equivalent to the newest DVD's. This film uses very slow pacing - I liked it a lot although it's certainly not something for the MTV generation where everything has to be done at warp speed. The camera dwells on the painting process brush stroke by brush stroke interspersed by the beautiful body of Emmanuelle B&eacute;art. The French countryside scenery, the old house of the artist and the studio are examples of beautiful photography. You have lots of time during this film to admire the old painted woodwork of the doors and mouldings - the spaciousness of the house reminds me of Rodin's old house now the Musee Rodin. The primary colors used on the interior doors and trim remind me a lot of Monets house at Giverny. This is an artists house. I loved this film for the atmosphere and the character development. I'm not sure if all films should be done this way, but the snails pace works well here. It allows you to soak up the atmosphere - after 4 hours it was over and believe it or not I was still looking for more. A film definitely not for everybody but I'm glad it was created. Watch this when you have lots of time and are not in any particular hurry to ""move onto the next thing"".

You may find it overlong and boring or completely fascinating, depending upon your patience with the leisurely pace and the oh so French talk about relationships, metaphysics and whatnot.I found no such boredom in watching the difficulty of creation because of the fine portrayal by Michel Piccoli of the irrascible and tasking artist but even more so by the object of his interest, the exquisite work of art that is Beart.  If a couple of hours of viewing the divine Emanuelle in the nude is too much for you, so be it, but it'll do for me.  Interestingly, the long exposure of her beautiful body allows the viewer to begin to see her as the artist does, as shape and texture, surfaces, planes and form.  There is also the effect of the artist's invasive exposure and objectification upon the subject. This is the central fascination of this film, less so the cryptic and enigmatic dialogue.  The artist and model struggle and the outcome of the struggle is change and re-examination for both.

Although the film is generally criticized for being way too long and boring, I personally found the film very appealing. I enjoyed the slow pacing. The film definitely involves the viewer, and 4 hours later, you feel like you really know these characters, who now have a life of their own. There is a substantial amount of nudity in the film, but it's more about posing for an artist than about sex. This is, in fact, an art film, not a mainstream film. As such, it delves into human emotion as much as it paints the beauty of the female form. I'm giving this film, in advance of its DVD release, 3 stars because it is being released in standard format, which is an insult to any film, and because it may not appeal to the average mainstream viewer, who may be too impatient to watch all 4 hours of it. But for me, it will be a welcome addition to my limited collection of French films.I absolutely agree with everything said by the 5-star reviewer (except for the statement about this being released in its orginal format, which is apparently erroneous). But having read contemporary French language critiques of this film, and having dicussed it with a few of my French friends (who mostly complained about its length), I still believe that the average mainstream non-French viewer will probably find the film a bit too long and boring.

Can looking at a beautiful woman who is naked for almost three of four hours long movie be not erotic? Is it possible to watch the movie where an Artist creates sketch after sketch of his model in preparation for a painting and many scenes run in real time and not become bored but instead be totally absorbed by the painter on the screen and how he was progressing with his work? Jacques Rivette's ""Le Belle Noiseuse"" is certainly not for every taste but I found it immensely rewarding. It is one of very few films where creative process with all its tension, uncertainty, selfishness and self-centering of an artist who once he began working is nearly oblivious not only to his model's discomfort but to the feelings of the ones close to him have been shown on the screen with such truthful passion, technical excellence, and tremendous acting.

When they mention the filmmakers that came from that school of filmmaking, they mention Jean-Luc Godard, Eric Rohmer, and Francois Truffault.  Rarely, if ever, do they mention Jacques Rivette.  When a friend of mine asked me my favorite French directors, I said Robert Bresson, Jean-Luc Godard, and Jacques Rivette.  My friend said ""Rivette?""  Jacques Rivette's films stand out from any other French filmmaker of his time.  The other French New Wave filmmakers were prolific, whereas Rivette would make a film every few years.  Rivette's films are generally very long (the most extreme example being the film Out 1, which runs 12 1/2 hours, his other films run on average 3-4 hours), and concern themselves with the artistic process.  This is a 4 hour film (slightly longer than most Rivette films, but not the longest), but it unfolds magisterially and beautifully.  I saw it in a theater (with an intermission), and I was entralled.  It is one of Rivette's best films, and one that really shows the agony of artistic creation.  Creating art is a long and arduous process.  Kubrick compared his art, filmmaking, to trying to write War and Peace in a bumpy car ride, but when you've finished, it's an amazing feeling.  Its pacing is very slow and leisurely, but there isn't anything wrong with that.  I didn't feel bored, and I didn't feel that the film needed to be cut.  It's perfect the way it is.  The title is translated ""a pretty nuisance"", for those who are curious.  This film really captures that.  On a completely unrelated sidenote, I remember seeing this film with 2 couples in front of me.  The women liked it, but the men were bored out of their minds.  One kept shifting his head back and forth throughout the whole thing.  The men were probably just hoping to get laid afterwards, so that's why they went to see it.  You should really only see this film if you're a committed art cinema person.  Luckily, I am.

An existence with human relations offers both abstracts and tangibles, however, a complete description of existence is very difficult to illustrate in regards to human relation.  A complete description would illustrate moments of thought, feeling, and action, as these would interact with one another.  Thus, reality is a muddled concoction of the tangible and intangible.  The complete image of the truth will never be fully uncovered, as reality does not allow the audience to know the secrets that each individual possesses in their mind.  Despite the abstract concept of ultimate truth, La Belle Noiseuse conceptualizes such a moment where time and space merge into existence while it flirts with the notion of complete illustration of human existence.The story opens in a small courtyard during a sweltering summer day where Nicolas (David Bursztein) is sitting in the shadow enjoying a cup of coffee.  His girlfriend Marianne (Emmanuelle B&eacute;art) sneaks up on him taking a photo while pretending to be a paparazzi.  Two British women see the moment when Marianne takes the picture with the camera and the following situation, as they quickly come to their assumption of the situation.  However, this moment provides an insight to what is to come in the film, as the audience realizes that one cannot always trust what one sees.Porbus (Gilles Arbona), a friend of Nicolas and Marianne, arrives later the same day and he is to bring Nicolas who is an up and coming painter to meet Edouard Frenhofer (Michel Piccoli).  Frenhofer's wife, Liz, (Jane Birkin), greets them when they arrive and it seems Frenhofer has forgotten about his meeting with Nicolas.  However, Frenhofer returns home after they have waited for sometime in the hot afternoon sun sipping on something cool.  The sixty-year-old Frenhofer used to be a talented painter, but has not accomplished anything of significance in the last decade.During the visit at the Frenhofer's chteau, the audience will experience an ominous atmosphere, as if to warn the characters in the film.  Marianne recognizes there is something strange in the works, but Nicolas who wants to meet with Frenhofer puts her worries aside.  However, the bizarre ambiance continues to hang in the air, until Porbus accidentally shakes up the atmosphere at a late supper.The heat makes the small group seek the cool air of Frenhofer's studio.  Their conversation leads toward art and Frenhofer's creations, which eventually leads to La Belle Noiseuse.  La Belle Noiseuse is a painting that Frenhofer never created, but rather exists as an idea.  However, something suggests that it actually was painted, but he never was satisfied with the painting and it may have disappeared.  Later, when Porbus accidentally shakes up the atmosphere, the idea of using Marianne as a model for the La Belle Noiseuse materializes.  Nicolas agrees that it is a good idea and accepts on Marianne's behalf while Porbus agrees to purchase the painting.  Up to this point, the audience will only have seen less than 30 minutes of this epic four-hour long film.Later Marianne learns from Nicolas that he has accepted that she will model for Frenhoher.  Frustration boils up inside of her, but instead of following her own will she returns to the chteau to begin her modeling.  Cleverly, the director Jacques Rivette displays prolonged scenes where the audience can observe the creation of several sketches over the artist's shoulder.  Vigorously Frenhofer attempts to capture the essence of Marianne while she resists giving whatever he struggles to transfer to a canvas.  The audience can hear Frenhofer's hard work, as the pen is scratching the paper on which he is making sketches to help him capture the true Marianne.Throughout Frenhofer's artistic process, the audience can bear witness to Nicolas who begins change his mind as he feels both guilt and jealousy.  Initially, Liz offers comfort to Nicolas, but she too slowly changes her disposition of loving support to jealousy.  However, Liz's jealousy is not in regards to her husband being able to see Marianne naked all day, but rather due to a void inside her.  Simultaneously, as she is dealing with her jealousy she tries to protect Marianne from a painful experience, which she knows will hurt her at the end.La Belle Noiseuse is a brave film that tries to show something new, which Jacques Rivette successfully does.  The cerebral process and emotional struggle of an artist is brought to the light through painstakingly long scenes, which are necessary to depict what Rivette attempts to show.  Rivette proves that it is possible to combine the intangible and the tangible in one image, as he shows the long process of bringing them together in time and space on a simple fabric of canvas.",5,Arts Brilliant Union of the Tangible and Intangible...,1110240000,"03 8, 2005",2005,4896,"['Time', 'space', 'put', 'together', 'create', 'existence', 'existence', 'La', 'Belle', 'Noiseuse', 'human', 'interaction', 'existence', 'human', 'relations', 'abstracts', 'tangibles', 'however', 'complete', 'description', 'existence', 'very', 'difficult', 'illustrate', 'regards', 'human', 'relation', 'complete', 'description', 'would', 'illustrate', 'moments', 'thought', 'feeling', 'action', 'would', 'interact', 'one', 'Thus', 'reality', 'muddled', 'concoction', 'tangible', 'intangible', 'complete', 'image', 'truth', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'fully', 'uncovered', 'reality', 'not', 'allow', 'audience', 'know', 'secrets', 'individual', 'possesses', 'mind', 'abstract', 'concept', 'ultimate', 'truth', 'La', 'Belle', 'Noiseuse', 'moment', 'where', 'time', 'space', 'merge', 'existence', 'notion', 'complete', 'illustration', 'human', 'existence.The', 'story', 'small', 'courtyard', 'sweltering', 'summer', 'day', 'where', 'Nicolas', 'David', 'Bursztein', 'sitting', 'shadow', 'enjoying', 'cup', 'coffee', 'girlfriend', 'Marianne', 'Emmanuelle', 'B', 'eacute', 'art', 'up', 'taking', 'photo', 'pretending', 'be', 'paparazzi', 'Two', 'British', 'women', 'see', 'moment', 'when', 'Marianne', 'picture', 'camera', 'following', 'situation', 'quickly', 'come', 'assumption', 'situation', 'However', 'moment', 'insight', 'what', 'come', 'film', 'audience', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'always', 'trust', 'what', 'one', 'sees.Porbus', 'Gilles', 'Arbona', 'friend', 'Nicolas', 'Marianne', 'later', 'same', 'day', 'bring', 'Nicolas', 'who', 'up', 'coming', 'painter', 'meet', 'Edouard', 'Frenhofer', 'Michel', 'Piccoli', 'Frenhofer', 'wife', 'Liz', 'Jane', 'Birkin', 'when', 'arrive', 'Frenhofer', 'forgotten', 'meeting', 'Nicolas', 'However', 'Frenhofer', 'home', 'have', 'waited', 'sometime', 'hot', 'afternoon', 'sun', 'sipping', 'something', 'cool', 'sixty-year-old', 'Frenhofer', 'used', 'be', 'talented', 'painter', 'not', 'accomplished', 'anything', 'significance', 'last', 'decade.During', 'visit', 'Frenhofer', 'chteau', 'audience', 'will', 'experience', 'ominous', 'atmosphere', 'warn', 'characters', 'film', 'Marianne', 'something', 'strange', 'works', 'Nicolas', 'who', 'meet', 'Frenhofer', 'worries', 'aside', 'However', 'bizarre', 'ambiance', 'hang', 'air', 'Porbus', 'accidentally', 'up', 'atmosphere', 'late', 'supper.The', 'heat', 'small', 'group', 'seek', 'cool', 'air', 'Frenhofer', 'studio', 'conversation', 'art', 'Frenhofer', 'creations', 'eventually', 'La', 'Belle', 'Noiseuse', 'La', 'Belle', 'Noiseuse', 'painting', 'Frenhofer', 'never', 'created', 'rather', 'idea', 'However', 'something', 'actually', 'was', 'painted', 'never', 'was', 'satisfied', 'painting', 'may', 'have', 'disappeared', 'Later', 'when', 'Porbus', 'accidentally', 'up', 'atmosphere', 'idea', 'using', 'Marianne', 'model', 'La', 'Belle', 'Noiseuse', 'Nicolas', 'good', 'idea', 'accepts', 'Marianne', 'behalf', 'Porbus', 'purchase', 'painting', 'Up', 'point', 'audience', 'will', 'only', 'have', 'seen', 'less', '30', 'minutes', 'epic', 'four-hour', 'long', 'film.Later', 'Marianne', 'Nicolas', 'accepted', 'will', 'model', 'Frenhoher', 'Frustration', 'up', 'inside', 'instead', 'following', 'own', 'will', 'chteau', 'begin', 'modeling', 'Cleverly', 'director', 'Jacques', 'Rivette', 'displays', 'prolonged', 'scenes', 'where', 'audience', 'can', 'observe', 'creation', 'several', 'sketches', 'artist', 'shoulder', 'Vigorously', 'Frenhofer', 'attempts', 'capture', 'essence', 'Marianne', 'giving', 'transfer', 'canvas', 'audience', 'can', 'hear', 'Frenhofer', 'hard', 'work', 'pen', 'scratching', 'paper', 'making', 'sketches', 'help', 'capture', 'true', 'Marianne.Throughout', 'Frenhofer', 'artistic', 'process', 'audience', 'can', 'bear', 'witness', 'Nicolas', 'who', 'change', 'mind', 'guilt', 'jealousy', 'Initially', 'Liz', 'comfort', 'Nicolas', 'too', 'slowly', 'disposition', 'loving', 'support', 'jealousy', 'However', 'Liz', 'jealousy', 'not', 'regards', 'husband', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'Marianne', 'naked', 'day', 'rather', 'due', 'void', 'Simultaneously', 'dealing', 'jealousy', 'protect', 'Marianne', 'painful', 'experience', 'will', 'hurt', 'end.La', 'Belle', 'Noiseuse', 'brave', 'film', 'show', 'something', 'new', 'Jacques', 'Rivette', 'successfully', 'cerebral', 'process', 'emotional', 'struggle', 'artist', 'brought', 'light', 'painstakingly', 'long', 'scenes', 'are', 'necessary', 'depict', 'what', 'Rivette', 'show', 'Rivette', 'possible', 'combine', 'intangible', 'tangible', 'one', 'image', 'long', 'process', 'bringing', 'together', 'time', 'space', 'simple', 'fabric', 'canvas']",N/A

Alcat ""Curiosity killed the cat, but sa...","[29, 29]","""La Belle Noiseuse"", directed by Jacques Rivette, is a splendid albeit admittedly extremely long film that manages to make the spectator understand the possibilities and dangers that are distinctive of art. An extremely good painter can bare the soul of his subject, but that is not always a good thing, specially if the artist's ruthless eye concentrates on the worse moral traits of his model. When is it time to stop? And can a real artist betray himself and his art and not paint what he is seeing?That is the problem Edouard Frenhofer (Michel Piccoli) faced, when he had to choose between his art and his wife. Frenhofer, an extremely famous artist, decided to stop painting a portrait called ""La Belle Noiseuse"", because he knew that his model, his wife Liz (Jane Birkin), would hate the results. According to Liz, ""He wanted to paint me because he loved me. He stopped painting me because he loved me"".Many years later, Frenhofer gets another chance to finish his painting, thanks to the visit of an admirer, a young painter named Nicolas (David Bursztein). Nicolas suggests that his beautiful girlfriend, Marianne (Emmanuelle B&eacute;art), could be the new nude model for ""La Belle Noiseuse"". Frenhofer loves the idea, as does Liz. Even Marianne, mad at first at Nicolas for his suggestion, ends up embracing the challenge. However, as days go by and Frenhofer and Marianne become immersed in a world of their own, Nicolas and Liz start to feel restless, abandoned. They know that the new painting will make a difference, and that things will never be the same between them and their loved ones. But can they do something? And will it be enough?Of course, the answers to those questions don't really matter, and you will discover them soon enough if you watch this film. What is important, then? In my opinion, the director wants to show us the process of creation through the eyes of an artist and his model, and the hard choices that sometimes must sometimes be made in order to create a real work of art. Is it worth it? And how much of himself and others should the artist be willing to risk? Those are, from my point of view, the real questions that ""La Belle Noiseuse"" makes you ask yourself.On the whole, I can say that I really liked this film, but that I don't recommend it for everybody. If you are just looking for an engaging movie that will entertaing you and make you laugh, ""La Belle Noiseuse"" is not for you. On the other hand, if you are in the mood for a relatively little known jewel that will amaze and disturb you, making you think, watch this dvd.Belen Alcat",4,"""He wanted to paint me because he loved me.

But this is not merely a character study of the old artist, but of his model as well.

Edouard Frenhofer is a master painter who has spent the past 10 years languishing in contented happiness. Languishing because an artist actively pursing the truth in art is never contented. Blood needs to be shed and suffering must be endured for truth can be cruel. ""La Belle Noiseuse"" was Frenhofer's unfinished masterpiece; an attempt that was abandoned. To paint the truth it is not enough to  merely copy what is seen by the eyes. One must go all the way, to penetrate, to . . . invent!

The attempt by the artist to venture into the soul, and to return not only with the essence of the subject, but the essence of the artist as well.

Emmanuelle B&eacute;art is the very essence of a beautiful woman.  To watch her in this film must be difficult for women, because of her striking natural beauty and grace.  Few if any would measure up, worldwide.Such a film could never be made by the American studios because of its length and painstaking attention to detail, as the aging artist--played magnificently by Michel Piccoli--attempts to create his ""masterpiece,"" one stroke at a time.

The only reason for four rather than five stars is because its length will not enthrall everyone, but it is well worth watching from beginning to end, and then watching the special features that come with the DVDs.",4,Emmanuelle B&eacute;art is the quintessence of a beautiful woman,1219363200,"08 22, 2008",2008,1051,"['La', 'Belle', 'Noiseuse', 'lovely', 'four-hour', 'film', 'artist', 'model', 'men', 'women', 'Emmanuelle', 'B', 'eacute', 'art', 'very', 'essence', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'watch', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'difficult', 'women', 'striking', 'natural', 'beauty', 'grace', 'Few', 'would', 'measure', 'up', 'film', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'made', 'American', 'studios', 'length', 'painstaking', 'attention', 'detail', 'aging', 'artist', 'played', 'magnificently', 'Michel', 'Piccoli', 'attempts', 'create', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'stroke', 'time', 'film', 'intermission', 'would', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'vital', 'when', 'was', 'screened', 'French', 'cinemas', 'elsewhere.To', 'watch', 'two', 'DVDs', 'take', 'time', 'do', 'so', 'brilliance', 'so', 'many', 'French', 'films', 'years', 'supporting', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'terrific', 'too', 'only', 'reason', 'four', 'rather', 'five', 'stars', 'length', 'will', 'not', 'enthrall', 'everyone', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'beginning', 'end', 'then', 'watching', 'special', 'features', 'come', 'DVDs']",N/A

According to her, it concerns something ""shameful--it's not the body that is shameful, not the nudity, but something else . . .""That ""something else"" is a violation, existentially speaking, of the enigma of the painter's model.  Such a violation cannot be seen without the mediation of art.  In a cinematic context, it is the risk the direction takes whenever it approaches its subject frontally, and we can see Rivette's tendency to retreat to wide shots, to place events off-screen, or to circle behind his players. Is this a critique of Bresson, who insisted on calling his players ""models"" rather than ""actors?""  (It is impossible not to recall the storied psychological scars Bresson's methods allegedly left on his players. )  It is clearly not that simple, for there are close-ups in NOISEUSE that seem to be as cruel to the actors as Frenhofer is to his model.This goes beyond Bresson in other ways: Rivette, always the reader, has patched together a thumping good story from literary sources ranging from Poe to Balzac to James, and in the process has created a true mystery thriller.  That the mystery hinges on four-minute shots of a hand scratching out a drawing makes it no less thrilling.  It tumbles forward toward a profoundly ironic ending worthy of the best James novels.The initial critical take on this film was that it was the most thorough document of the artistic process ever committed to film.  Well, yes and no.  It seems to be about the artistic process of a painter, but I think there may be a playful game of ""bait-and-switch"" afoot.  Watch B&eacute;art.  Watch, especially, Piccoli, who is a veritable encyclopedia of the actor's art, as mesmerizing in his scudding, absent-minded movements as he is in his sudden precision, always surprising.  Rivette's devotion to actors is clear in all his films: think of his sets, so resembling stages with their creaky boards, a sound ""effect"" in Rivette that more often than not takes the place of score.It may be that the artist of canvas, plaster, stone, or screen may reveal something secret, even  shameful, in his models.  It may even be that the unscrupulous artist is a thief of the soul.  But Rivette, for one, shows in LA BELLE NOISEUSE that he has given these things some serious thought.  And he is always generous to his actors.  The result is that the trust between artist and model demonstrated in this film amounts to a strong rebuke to the idea that film cannot show thought.  It can; it comes at a price, but in the hands of a master it can be as great a gift to the players as it is to the audience.",5,Artists and Models,1161302400,"10 20, 2006",2006,2818,"['living', 'film', '15', 'years', 'best', 'description', 'theme', 'words', 'character', 'Liz', 'Jane', 'Birkin', 'who', 'context', 'speaking', 'work', 'husband', 'painter', 'Frenhofer', 'According', 'something', 'shameful', 'not', 'body', 'shameful', 'not', 'nudity', 'something', 'else', 'something', 'else', 'violation', 'existentially', 'speaking', 'enigma', 'painter', 'model', 'violation', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'mediation', 'art', 'cinematic', 'context', 'risk', 'direction', 'whenever', 'subject', 'frontally', 'can', 'see', 'Rivette', 'tendency', 'retreat', 'wide', 'shots', 'place', 'events', 'off-screen', 'circle', 'players', 'critique', 'Bresson', 'who', 'insisted', 'calling', 'players', 'models', 'rather', 'actors', 'impossible', 'not', 'recall', 'storied', 'psychological', 'scars', 'Bresson', 'methods', 'allegedly', 'left', 'players', 'clearly', 'not', 'simple', 'are', 'close-ups', 'NOISEUSE', 'seem', 'be', 'cruel', 'actors', 'Frenhofer', 'model.This', 'Bresson', 'other', 'ways', 'Rivette', 'always', 'reader', 'patched', 'together', 'thumping', 'good', 'story', 'literary', 'sources', 'ranging', 'Poe', 'Balzac', 'James', 'process', 'created', 'true', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'mystery', 'four-minute', 'shots', 'hand', 'scratching', 'out', 'drawing', 'less', 'thrilling', 'forward', 'profoundly', 'ironic', 'ending', 'worthy', 'best', 'James', 'novels.The', 'initial', 'critical', 'take', 'film', 'was', 'was', 'most', 'thorough', 'document', 'artistic', 'process', 'ever', 'committed', 'film', 'Well', 'yes', 'be', 'artistic', 'process', 'painter', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'playful', 'game', 'bait-and-switch', 'afoot', 'Watch', 'B', 'eacute', 'art', 'Watch', 'especially', 'Piccoli', 'who', 'veritable', 'encyclopedia', 'actor', 'art', 'mesmerizing', 'scudding', 'absent-minded', 'movements', 'sudden', 'precision', 'always', 'surprising', 'Rivette', 'devotion', 'actors', 'clear', 'films', 'think', 'sets', 'so', 'resembling', 'stages', 'creaky', 'boards', 'sound', 'effect', 'Rivette', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'place', 'score.It', 'may', 'be', 'artist', 'canvas', 'plaster', 'stone', 'screen', 'may', 'reveal', 'something', 'secret', 'even', 'shameful', 'models', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'unscrupulous', 'artist', 'thief', 'soul', 'Rivette', 'one', 'LA', 'BELLE', 'NOISEUSE', 'given', 'things', 'serious', 'thought', 'always', 'generous', 'actors', 'result', 'trust', 'artist', 'model', 'demonstrated', 'film', 'strong', 'rebuke', 'idea', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'show', 'thought', 'can', 'price', 'hands', 'master', 'can', 'be', 'as', 'great', 'gift', 'players', 'audience']",N/A
