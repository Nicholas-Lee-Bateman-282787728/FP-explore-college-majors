1607108,A19552QR80XTOX,B00A9ZMNE2,Jungle Red,"[6, 7]","I'm a big Joan Crawford fan and, for the past few years, have been attempting to collect all of her available films on DVD for my collection. I was jazzed when I heard TCM was going to release four more Crawford films from the 1950s. Three of the films on this set - Autumn Leaves, Harriet Craig and The Story of Esther Costello - have been difficult to find and have never been released on DVD. In fact, I've only seen Autumn Leaves on TCM once in my life (though I'm sure it's been aired more than once) and had never seen Harriet Craig and Esther Costello aired on television.First, the films themselves. All four are solid releases. Not Oscar worthy and a bit on the campy side, but still well done and highly entertaining. In the 1950s, Crawford had yet to delve into the ""independent"" genre and was still getting work at big name studios. I wouldn't go so far to say these are A pictures but you wouldn't know that by Crawford's performances. No matter what film she was in, she always acted like she was starring in the biggest budget film of all time. Crawford never phoned it in. In my opinion, the weakest of the four films is Autumn Leaves mainly because it's a product of its own time. It's a good film but it will likely cause a few eye rolls because Crawford's character is a little too understanding and patient. It's still worth a look and definitely an interesting film that was ahead of its time. The standouts for me are Harriet Craig and Queen Bee mainly because Crawford is hell on wheels in both of these films and at her campy best. No one on the planet could play such a nasty character while looking oh-so-fabulous in over the top clothing (by Jean Louis, thank you very much) and oodles of jewels! As for extras, there are few. No commentaries or anything of that nature, but there are slide shows on each disc with lobby cards, movie posters and behind-the scenes photos.The only real downsides to this release is the price and the packaging. The price is a little on the high side but considering these films are not available anywhere else and they do look good (I won't get into aspect ratios, etc. because I have no idea what any of that means!) I can deal with it. I did shop around because frankly, I'm not too keen on paying $6 shipping for ONE single set which is what TCM charges. The packaging is also a pain. When I initially got this set, it took me 20 minutes to pry one disc out of the plastic holder. I don't know if the set I got has a manufacturing defect but getting the discs in and out is difficult. I'll probably end up putting the discs in paper sleeves because I nearly broke the disc with Harriet Craig on it trying to get it out.Despite the slightly inflated price and shoddy plastic case, I'm pleased as punch that I bought this set. It's a must for Crawford fans and I'm glad TCM got the bright idea to release more of Crawford's hard to find films.",5,"Awesome Collection, Terrible Packaging",1362096000,"03 1, 2013",2013,2903,"[""'m"", 'big', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'fan', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'attempting', 'collect', 'available', 'films', 'DVD', 'collection', 'was', 'jazzed', 'when', 'heard', 'TCM', 'was', 'going', 'release', 'four', 'more', 'Crawford', 'films', '1950s', 'Three', 'films', 'set', 'Autumn', 'Harriet', 'Craig', 'Story', 'Esther', 'Costello', 'have', 'been', 'difficult', 'find', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'Autumn', 'TCM', 'once', 'life', ""'m"", 'sure', 'been', 'aired', 'more', 'once', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Harriet', 'Craig', 'Esther', 'Costello', 'aired', 'television.First', 'films', 'four', 'are', 'solid', 'releases', 'Not', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'bit', 'campy', 'side', 'still', 'well', 'done', 'highly', 'entertaining', '1950s', 'Crawford', 'had', 'yet', 'delve', 'independent', 'genre', 'was', 'still', 'getting', 'work', 'big', 'name', 'studios', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'are', 'pictures', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'Crawford', 'performances', 'matter', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'always', 'acted', 'was', 'starring', 'biggest', 'budget', 'film', 'time', 'Crawford', 'never', 'phoned', 'opinion', 'weakest', 'four', 'films', 'Autumn', 'Leaves', 'mainly', 'product', 'own', 'time', 'good', 'film', 'will', 'likely', 'cause', 'few', 'eye', 'rolls', 'Crawford', 'character', 'little', 'too', 'understanding', 'patient', 'still', 'worth', 'look', 'definitely', 'interesting', 'film', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'standouts', 'are', 'Harriet', 'Craig', 'Queen', 'Bee', 'mainly', 'Crawford', 'hell', 'wheels', 'films', 'campy', 'best', 'one', 'planet', 'could', 'play', 'nasty', 'character', 'looking', 'oh-so-fabulous', 'top', 'clothing', 'Jean', 'Louis', 'thank', 'very', 'much', 'oodles', 'jewels', 'extras', 'are', 'few', 'commentaries', 'anything', 'nature', 'are', 'slide', 'shows', 'disc', 'lobby', 'cards', 'movie', 'posters', 'behind-the', 'scenes', 'only', 'real', 'downsides', 'release', 'price', 'packaging', 'price', 'little', 'high', 'side', 'considering', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'available', 'anywhere', 'else', 'do', 'look', 'good', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'aspect', 'ratios', 'etc', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'can', 'deal', 'did', 'shop', 'frankly', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'keen', 'paying', '6', 'shipping', 'ONE', 'single', 'set', 'what', 'TCM', 'packaging', 'also', 'pain', 'When', 'initially', 'got', 'set', 'took', '20', 'minutes', 'pry', 'one', 'disc', 'plastic', 'holder', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'set', 'got', 'manufacturing', 'defect', 'getting', 'discs', 'difficult', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'end', 'up', 'putting', 'discs', 'paper', 'sleeves', 'nearly', 'broke', 'disc', 'Harriet', 'Craig', 'trying', 'get', 'out.Despite', 'slightly', 'inflated', 'price', 'shoddy', 'plastic', 'case', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'punch', 'bought', 'set', 'must', 'Crawford', 'fans', ""'m"", 'glad', 'TCM', 'got', 'bright', 'idea', 'release', 'more', 'Crawford', 'hard', 'find', 'films']",Suppressed in Act:Title Reflecting in Catalog: Joan Crawford in the 1950s Harriet Craig / Queen Bee / Autumn Leaves / The Story of Esther Costello
