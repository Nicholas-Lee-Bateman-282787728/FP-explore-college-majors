Because of that I am now leery of renting movies below at least 3 stars, so for the longest time I avoided this movie. Finally, being out of anything else to watch, I decided to chance it. Boy, what a pleasant surprise! Maybe because my expectations were so low to begin with? I don't know, all I know is that this was a professionally done movie, the actors (while their accents were mildly annoying) were at least mid-grade professionals, and the story line was not horrible - at least not compared to most zombie movies. Plenty of action, though no big explosions or anything and not very gory.Seeing as there are a bunch of low ratings for this film, maybe I just have weird taste in movies. Maybe I feel that only boring movies made by what appear to be 12 year olds who con you out of $1.99 or more deserve 1 star ratings. But my guess is that if you like zombie movies this film will be a good rent.",5,I don't get the 1 & 2 Star ratings,1346112000,"08 28, 2012",2012,1023,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'duped', 'renting', 'movies', 'amazon', 'look', 'were', 'shot', '12', 'year', 'old', '30', 'camera', 'am', 'now', 'leery', 'renting', 'movies', 'least', '3', 'stars', 'so', 'longest', 'time', 'avoided', 'movie', 'Finally', 'being', 'anything', 'else', 'watch', 'decided', 'chance', 'Boy', 'what', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Maybe', 'expectations', 'were', 'so', 'low', 'begin', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'know', 'was', 'professionally', 'done', 'movie', 'actors', 'accents', 'were', 'mildly', 'annoying', 'were', 'least', 'mid-grade', 'professionals', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'not', 'horrible', 'least', 'not', 'compared', 'most', 'zombie', 'movies', 'Plenty', 'action', 'big', 'explosions', 'anything', 'not', 'very', 'gory.Seeing', 'are', 'bunch', 'low', 'ratings', 'film', 'maybe', 'just', 'have', 'weird', 'taste', 'movies', 'Maybe', 'feel', 'only', 'boring', 'movies', 'made', 'what', 'appear', 'be', '12', 'year', 'olds', 'who', 'con', '1.99', 'more', 'deserve', '1', 'star', 'ratings', 'guess', 'like', 'zombie', 'movies', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'rent']",N/A

The acting is fine, the camerawas handled well.  The make-up effects were fine, and the gore action scenes werefor the most part computer generated.  This movie was more like 28 Days Later thanNight of the Living Dead.  A virus has mutated humanity into violent killers thatlook somewhat zombie-ish.  We have a rag-tag group of survivors that are immuneto the virus and develop a plan to grow and be safe and secure from the mutants.When they travel and explore, they findmore survivors along the way.  This is not a spoiler review.  There is enoughplot to keep the story interesting.  There is not a lot of zombie action, butthe story makes up for the difference.

It's German, but the actors actually speak English, and they do so very well! There are a few bumps in the story, and some slow areas, especially at the beginning, and the ending is slightly cheesy, but over all, I think Extinction is a re-watchable / keeper infected / zombie movie for me!The infected range from slow stumblers, to ""Hulk"", to full tilt, back flipping acrobats. There was no explanation for why there were different types of infected. The infected were similar to the infected in Steve Nile's Remains in that some of them ""sleep"" at night and some eat fellow infected!What this movie has is a cast of actors that can act. The characters are not the stereo-typical band of survivors and they are pretty well fleshed out and developed. The script was thought out and well written and joy of joy, the characters were given realistic dialogue, instead of  shallow chit chat and f-bomb diarrhea of the mouth! There is no mindless Hollywood action hero crap in the action nor heaps of gore for gore sake. The CGI that is used is not over the top. And the fact that this was a budget film didn't stand out at all. The film makers really took their time when coming up with a good story, they had great actors and found great locations to film in. The running time was just under 2 hours which I thought was perfect. ...It is a worth while and enjoyable movie!",4,better than what i have seen lately,1371513600,"06 18, 2013",2013,1560,"['Now', 'maybe', 'fact', 'last', 'half', 'dozen', 'zombie', '/', 'infected', 'movies', 'have', 'watched', 'past', 'few', 'months', 'have', 'been', 'so', '-so', 'average', 'just', 'plain', 'crap', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'German', 'actors', 'actually', 'speak', 'English', 'do', 'so', 'very', 'well', 'are', 'few', 'bumps', 'story', 'slow', 'areas', 'especially', 'beginning', 'ending', 'slightly', 'cheesy', 'think', 'Extinction', 're-watchable', '/', 'keeper', 'infected', '/', 'zombie', 'movie', 'infected', 'range', 'slow', 'stumblers', 'Hulk', 'full', 'tilt', 'back', 'flipping', 'acrobats', 'was', 'explanation', 'why', 'were', 'different', 'types', 'infected', 'infected', 'were', 'similar', 'infected', 'Steve', 'Nile', 'Remains', 'sleep', 'night', 'eat', 'fellow', 'infected', 'What', 'movie', 'cast', 'actors', 'can', 'act', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'stereo-typical', 'band', 'survivors', 'are', 'pretty', 'well', 'fleshed', 'out', 'developed', 'script', 'was', 'thought', 'out', 'well', 'written', 'joy', 'joy', 'characters', 'were', 'given', 'realistic', 'dialogue', 'instead', 'shallow', 'chit', 'chat', 'f-bomb', 'diarrhea', 'mouth', 'mindless', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'hero', 'crap', 'action', 'heaps', 'gore', 'gore', 'sake', 'CGI', 'used', 'not', 'top', 'fact', 'was', 'budget', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'stand', 'out', 'film', 'makers', 'really', 'took', 'time', 'when', 'coming', 'up', 'good', 'story', 'had', 'great', 'actors', 'found', 'great', 'locations', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'was', 'just', '2', 'hours', 'thought', 'was', 'perfect', 'worth', 'enjoyable', 'movie']",N/A
