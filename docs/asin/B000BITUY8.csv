942921,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B000BITUY8,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[1, 3]","Viva La Bam, basically a spin-off of Jackass, has since become my new favorite show, or at least the first three seasons did. The latest seasons, however, don't seem right. They seem staged, as if every little thing was planned ahead of time. The randomness of the first few seasons is gone. While it's not bad, it just isn't the same. Both seasons have their gems of episodes, but most of them flop. The best part of this collection is the extras DVD. Here is where the randomness is, with deleted scenes too crazy to show on TV, and my favorite, the ""Random A** Moments,"" which is basically a collection of skits that weren't on the show but in the shows format (unlike deleted scenes, which start and finish without any intros or anything: you'll see what I mean by this when you see the DVDs). Also on the bonus DVD is ""Viva La Top 5"" which is an award-like show that has some of the best moments in each well-known category (messing with Phil, messing with Vito, April freak outs, best food moments, and best wake-ups).While the latest collection of Viva La Bam episodes are fun, I can't actually recommend buying this collection for anything other than the bonuses and the commentary. If you've seen the episodes on MTV, however, even the bonuses isn't worth the price. I personally bought it because I haven't seen the newest seasons and planned to get the collection later on. While I'm not disappointed, I know it could have been better.",3,Seems Staged,1138665600,"01 31, 2006",2006,1446,"['Viva', 'La', 'Bam', 'basically', 'spin-off', 'Jackass', 'become', 'new', 'favorite', 'show', 'least', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'did', 'latest', 'seasons', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'right', 'seem', 'staged', 'little', 'thing', 'was', 'planned', 'ahead', 'time', 'randomness', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'gone', 'not', 'bad', 'just', ""n't"", 'same', 'seasons', 'have', 'gems', 'episodes', 'most', 'flop', 'best', 'part', 'collection', 'extras', 'DVD', 'Here', 'where', 'randomness', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'too', 'crazy', 'show', 'TV', 'favorite', 'Random', 'A**', 'Moments', 'basically', 'collection', 'skits', 'were', ""n't"", 'show', 'shows', 'format', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'start', 'finish', 'intros', 'anything', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'when', 'see', 'DVDs', 'Also', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'Viva', 'La', 'Top', '5', 'award-like', 'show', 'best', 'moments', 'well-known', 'category', 'messing', 'Phil', 'messing', 'Vito', 'April', 'freak', 'outs', 'best', 'food', 'moments', 'best', 'wake-ups', 'latest', 'collection', 'Viva', 'La', 'Bam', 'episodes', 'are', 'fun', 'ca', ""n't"", 'actually', 'recommend', 'buying', 'collection', 'anything', 'other', 'bonuses', 'commentary', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'episodes', 'MTV', 'however', 'even', 'bonuses', ""n't"", 'worth', 'price', 'personally', 'bought', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'newest', 'seasons', 'planned', 'get', 'collection', 'later', ""'m"", 'not', 'disappointed', 'know', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better']",N/A

942929,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B000BITUY8,Tim Janson,"[12, 14]","Say what you want to say about Bam or the show...he moved from Jackass where he killed himself doing stupid stunts for nothing, to his own show where he's evidently now a millionaire living in a big home he bought for his parents and living the good life with his friends as a total goof off.  We should all be so lucky!  I also can't believe it's been 5 seasons.  How is it that the show started in 2004 and yet they've done 5 seasons?At any rate season four starts as the whole cast go to Europe.  Phil and april think they are going off to enjoy a romantic getaway on their own not knowing that Bam, Vito, and the rest of the gang are going along too.  The road/air trip would be a recurring theme throughout seasons 4 & 5 as the troupe would journey to Louisiana, Mexico, Pennsylvania (For Groundhog's day), Brazil and Finland.Among my favorite episodes are ""Ape's Birthday Surprise"" where Bam surprises April with meeting and getting on Stage with Billy Idol, ""Lost Lambo"" where Ryan challenges Bam to a race but his prized lamborgini comes up missing, and the one where Bam knocks out Vito's bedroom window and replaces it with an automatic garage door.Silly, infantile, and darn funny.",5,I CAN'T HELP BUT LAUGH,1136937600,"01 11, 2006",2006,1192,"['Say', 'what', 'want', 'say', 'Bam', 'show', 'moved', 'Jackass', 'where', 'killed', 'doing', 'stupid', 'stunts', 'nothing', 'own', 'show', 'where', 'evidently', 'now', 'millionaire', 'living', 'big', 'home', 'bought', 'parents', 'living', 'good', 'life', 'friends', 'total', 'goof', 'should', 'be', 'so', 'lucky', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'been', '5', 'seasons', 'How', 'show', 'started', '2004', 'yet', ""'ve"", 'done', '5', 'seasons', 'rate', 'season', 'four', 'whole', 'cast', 'go', 'Europe', 'Phil', 'april', 'think', 'are', 'going', 'enjoy', 'romantic', 'getaway', 'own', 'not', 'knowing', 'Bam', 'Vito', 'rest', 'gang', 'are', 'going', 'along', 'too', 'road/air', 'trip', 'would', 'be', 'recurring', 'theme', 'seasons', '4', '5', 'troupe', 'would', 'journey', 'Louisiana', 'Mexico', 'Pennsylvania', 'Groundhog', 'day', 'Brazil', 'Finland.Among', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'are', 'Ape', 'Birthday', 'Surprise', 'where', 'Bam', 'April', 'meeting', 'getting', 'Stage', 'Billy', 'Idol', 'Lost', 'Lambo', 'where', 'Ryan', 'Bam', 'race', 'prized', 'lamborgini', 'up', 'missing', 'one', 'where', 'Bam', 'out', 'Vito', 'bedroom', 'window', 'replaces', 'automatic', 'garage', 'door.Silly', 'infantile', 'darn', 'funny']",N/A
942930,A1A2SWJHNJ10FP,B000BITUY8,"Troy Kearney ""avid reader""","[7, 8]","For 5 seasons, Brandon Margera, aka ""Bam"" was the poster child for rebellion with his ability to do whatever he wanted to do just as long as it drove the rest of his family and friends completely nuts.  And for 5 seasons fans tuned in to see what Bam would do next.Well for those that wanted to see the final barrage of stunts and adventures involving Bam, April, Phil, Don Vito and Bam's running buddies (Ryan Dunn, Raab Himself, Brandon DiCamillo aka ""Dico"" and Rake Yohn) the final 2 seasons of Viva La Bam are finally out in Viva La Bam: Complete Seasons 4 & 5.The series draws to a close with the final 16 episodes of VLB on 2 discs (1 for season 4 and 1 for season 5) as Bam and crew continue to do ""whatever the ... {they} want"" and raise more trouble and calamity for their parents and uncle.Season 4 starts with a 2-parter that finds Phil and April heading off to Europe to celebrate their anniversary.  Bam decides to crash the trip and turn it into a trip across Europe, VLB style that includes Vito having to dress in clothing that relates to the country they are in and ending with Phil and Ape getting a dinner prepared by the gang that goes way awry when...well I won't spoil it for you but one person gets in deep trouble and it isn't who you would normally suspect.  Other episodes find the crew needing jobs to pay a major heating bill, Bam creating his own state and heading off to celebrate Groundhog Day.In Season 5, the gang starts off by heading off to Brazil to check out the sights and have fun (except Dico, who sticks around to torment Phil and Ape), April celebrating her birthday with a little unique help from Bam and crew (and Billy Idol, who helps Bam turn his $250,000 Lambo from a hardtop into a convertible...just call it an instant ""Pimp My Ride""), Vito finally getting revenge on Bam with a little help from Mike Vallely (this episode is CLASSIC) and in another episode stealing Bam's Hummer, and in the final episode of the series Bam tries to reunite Raab with the mail order bride he met and married in season 2.At the end Bam states that there will not be a 6th Season of VLB but the door is left open for future specials so just because the final episode is of the series doesn't totally mean that the hijinks are all done for Bam and crew.The 3rd disc is a bonus dice containing deleted scenes from both seasons of the show, an episode of MTV Cribs that toured the house for the show, and a ""bonus"" episode of the show called Viva La Top 5 which showcases the top 5 moments from the series in 5 different categories.The discs also contain additional commentary on all episodes from Bam and the entire gang (and FINALLY we hear Don Vito on commentary!!!)SO if you are a Viva La Bam fan and already have the first 3 seasons in your DVD collection then VLB: Complete Seasons 4 & 5 is essential to complete your set.  They say that the best go out on top and no one can argue that Bam did it, though technically the book isn't written on the final chapter...just this part of the VLB story.",5,Bam fires one final parting shot...or so we might be led to believe,1140998400,"02 27, 2006",2006,3029,"['5', 'seasons', 'Brandon', 'Margera', 'Bam', 'was', 'poster', 'child', 'rebellion', 'ability', 'do', 'whatever', 'wanted', 'do', 'just', 'as', 'long', 'drove', 'rest', 'family', 'friends', 'completely', 'nuts', '5', 'seasons', 'fans', 'tuned', 'see', 'what', 'Bam', 'would', 'do', 'next.Well', 'wanted', 'see', 'final', 'barrage', 'stunts', 'adventures', 'involving', 'Bam', 'April', 'Phil', 'Don', 'Vito', 'Bam', 'running', 'buddies', 'Ryan', 'Dunn', 'Raab', 'Himself', 'Brandon', 'DiCamillo', 'Dico', 'Rake', 'Yohn', 'final', '2', 'seasons', 'Viva', 'La', 'Bam', 'are', 'finally', 'out', 'Viva', 'La', 'Bam', 'Complete', 'Seasons', '4', '5.The', 'series', 'draws', 'close', 'final', '16', 'episodes', 'VLB', '2', 'discs', '1', 'season', '4', '1', 'season', '5', 'Bam', 'crew', 'continue', 'do', 'whatever', 'want', 'raise', 'more', 'trouble', 'calamity', 'parents', 'uncle.Season', '4', 'starts', '2-parter', 'Phil', 'April', 'heading', 'off', 'Europe', 'celebrate', 'anniversary', 'Bam', 'crash', 'trip', 'turn', 'trip', 'Europe', 'VLB', 'style', 'Vito', 'having', 'dress', 'clothing', 'country', 'are', 'ending', 'Phil', 'Ape', 'getting', 'dinner', 'prepared', 'gang', 'way', 'awry', 'when', 'well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'one', 'person', 'deep', 'trouble', ""n't"", 'who', 'would', 'normally', 'suspect', 'Other', 'episodes', 'find', 'crew', 'needing', 'jobs', 'pay', 'major', 'heating', 'bill', 'Bam', 'creating', 'own', 'state', 'heading', 'off', 'celebrate', 'Groundhog', 'Day.In', 'Season', '5', 'gang', 'off', 'heading', 'off', 'Brazil', 'check', 'out', 'sights', 'have', 'fun', 'Dico', 'who', 'torment', 'Phil', 'Ape', 'April', 'celebrating', 'birthday', 'little', 'unique', 'help', 'Bam', 'crew', 'Billy', 'Idol', 'who', 'Bam', 'turn', '250,000', 'Lambo', 'hardtop', 'convertible', 'just', 'call', 'instant', 'Pimp', 'My', 'Ride', 'Vito', 'finally', 'getting', 'revenge', 'Bam', 'little', 'help', 'Mike', 'Vallely', 'episode', 'CLASSIC', 'episode', 'stealing', 'Bam', 'Hummer', 'final', 'episode', 'series', 'Bam', 'reunite', 'Raab', 'mail', 'order', 'met', 'married', 'season', '2.At', 'end', 'Bam', 'will', 'not', 'be', '6th', 'Season', 'VLB', 'door', 'left', 'open', 'future', 'specials', 'so', 'just', 'final', 'episode', 'series', ""n't"", 'totally', 'mean', 'hijinks', 'are', 'done', 'Bam', 'crew.The', '3rd', 'disc', 'bonus', 'dice', 'containing', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'seasons', 'show', 'episode', 'MTV', 'Cribs', 'toured', 'house', 'show', 'bonus', 'episode', 'show', 'called', 'Viva', 'La', 'Top', '5', 'top', '5', 'moments', 'series', '5', 'different', 'categories.The', 'discs', 'also', 'contain', 'additional', 'commentary', 'episodes', 'Bam', 'entire', 'gang', 'FINALLY', 'hear', 'Don', 'Vito', 'commentary', 'SO', 'are', 'Viva', 'La', 'Bam', 'fan', 'already', 'have', 'first', '3', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'collection', 'then', 'VLB', 'Complete', 'Seasons', '4', '5', 'essential', 'complete', 'set', 'say', 'best', 'go', 'out', 'top', 'one', 'can', 'argue', 'Bam', 'did', 'though', 'technically', 'book', ""n't"", 'written', 'final', 'chapter', 'just', 'part', 'VLB', 'story']",N/A
