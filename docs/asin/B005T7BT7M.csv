But, we stayed with it and it turned out to be a very good representation of the trials and tribulations of being lesbians. If you can wade through the first 10 or so minutes, it will be worth your time. Youngsters wouldn't appreciate how these women have suffered throughout their lives, mainly because today's LGBT community doesn't face the fear factor in being gay/lesbian. Thank God they can be out and proud and that society today is finally, step by step, giving ALL of us equality. I had a time trying to keep a couple of the characters straight but it honestly didn't effect the movie. I AM glad we rented it instead of buying it. Good rental, not for owning. Of course, that's our opinion. You may decide to buy after watching it. Glad we watched it.

But I must say I was greatly disappointed. I felt the acting was average and the writing was trying to keep a heavy topic light; it didn't work. A much better choice would be Pariah which also expresses an aspect of coming out but with much better acting, cast selection and direction. Another excellent choice would be Saving Face.
