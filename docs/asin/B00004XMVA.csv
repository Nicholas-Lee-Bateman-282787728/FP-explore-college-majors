556458,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00004XMVA,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","One of those cult 90's teen comedies that has a huge fan base despite being rather uninspired, `Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead' is highly preposterous fun that passes the time rather easily without giving the audience much to remember.  It feels like it is trying to follow in the footsteps of successful 80's films like `Adventures in Babysitting', but it doesn't quite find its own voice and thus suffers accordingly.Christina Applegate plays Sue Ellen; the eldest teen in a family of rebellious children who seek independence when their mother flees to Australia for two months with her boyfriend.  Left in charge is an ancient disciplinarian who happens to croak the first night of her stay and instead of telling the authorities and risking the return of their mother, the children decide to dispose of the body and fend for themselves in their mother's absence.  Sue Ellen lucks into a really good job, but her inexperience and romance with the younger brother of an office rival threaten to derail her good fortune.The cast is mostly really on point.  Applegate is charming and Josh Charles is endearing.  Keith Coogan plays his role well, even if the slacker pot-head routine gets old in parts.  Joanna Cassidy is likable aloof and Jayne Brook is effectively sinister.  Major flaws are found in John Getz, who is just GROSS and a young David Duchovny, who just feels like he's forcing it the whole time.  This is predictable, and the laughs never feel completely genuine, but it is a film that is entertaining in the moment, and sometimes those films are just what the doctor ordered.",3,"It's middle of the road, but worth a gander...",1341619200,"07 7, 2012",2012,1598,"['One', 'cult', '90', 'teen', 'comedies', 'huge', 'fan', 'base', 'being', 'rather', 'uninspired', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Tell', 'Mom', 'Babysitter', 'Dead', 'highly', 'preposterous', 'fun', 'time', 'rather', 'easily', 'giving', 'audience', 'much', 'remember', 'trying', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'successful', '80', 'films', 'Adventures', 'Babysitting', ""n't"", 'quite', 'find', 'own', 'voice', 'thus', 'suffers', 'accordingly.Christina', 'Applegate', 'plays', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'eldest', 'teen', 'family', 'rebellious', 'children', 'who', 'seek', 'independence', 'when', 'mother', 'flees', 'Australia', 'two', 'months', 'boyfriend', 'Left', 'charge', 'ancient', 'disciplinarian', 'who', 'croak', 'first', 'night', 'stay', 'instead', 'telling', 'authorities', 'risking', 'return', 'mother', 'children', 'decide', 'dispose', 'body', 'fend', 'mother', 'absence', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'inexperience', 'romance', 'younger', 'brother', 'office', 'rival', 'threaten', 'derail', 'good', 'fortune.The', 'cast', 'mostly', 'really', 'point', 'Applegate', 'charming', 'Josh', 'Charles', 'endearing', 'Keith', 'Coogan', 'role', 'well', 'even', 'slacker', 'pot-head', 'routine', 'old', 'parts', 'Joanna', 'Cassidy', 'likable', 'aloof', 'Jayne', 'Brook', 'effectively', 'sinister', 'Major', 'flaws', 'are', 'found', 'John', 'Getz', 'who', 'just', 'GROSS', 'young', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'who', 'just', 'feels', 'forcing', 'whole', 'time', 'predictable', 'laughs', 'never', 'feel', 'completely', 'genuine', 'film', 'entertaining', 'moment', 'sometimes', 'films', 'are', 'just', 'what', 'doctor', 'ordered']",N/A

Sue Ellen is seventeen and beleives for that one minute her mother would leave her in charge of her brothers and sister until she discovers that their mother has left them with a tyrant of a baby sitter, after being run rough shot on by the sitter Sue Ellen goes to talk to her only to discover that she died in her sleep. The children realizing that unless they have a signed coroners report that says died of natural causes in their hands their mother will blame them for the babysitters death, so they put her in a box with a note and leave her at a mortuary only to discover the money their mother left them was with the babysitter. They discuss their options from blackmailing their no-good father to going to their mother's freinds until it becomes obvious someone has to get a job, and that falls to Sue Ellen. Desperate she fakes a resume and gets a job working at a clothing company, where she makes an enemy of a secretary who was supposed to have her job. Meanwhile at home her brother Kenny spends his time hanging out with his freinds smoking weed, and being an all around louse. Her younger sibs steal petty cash from Sue Ellen and when the youngest breaks his leg and this makes Kenny start to take responsibility, to make matters even worse Sue Ellen says they can use her house for a fashion show and this prompts her to make this clear to her siblings. That they were as guilty as she was and if they didn't clean up the house and help her she'd make sure their summer freedom becomes winter prison. In the end the two eldest, Kenny and Sue Ellen learn there's more to being adults then freedom and giving orders to the kids. Its ending up with a responsibility, the realization that somebody has to make money so everyone can eat, somebody has to clean the house, and somebody has to cook.A very good movie, though wait until the kids are in their teens to say the least.",5,a modern lord of the flies,1342310400,"07 15, 2012",2012,2016,"['Do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Mom', 'Babysitter', 'Dead', 'more', 'modern', 'take', 'Lord', 'flies', 'set', 'late', 'eighties', 'early', 'nineties', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'seventeen', 'beleives', 'one', 'minute', 'mother', 'would', 'leave', 'charge', 'brothers', 'sister', 'mother', 'left', 'tyrant', 'baby', 'sitter', 'being', 'run', 'rough', 'shot', 'sitter', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'talk', 'only', 'discover', 'died', 'sleep', 'children', 'realizing', 'have', 'signed', 'coroners', 'report', 'died', 'natural', 'causes', 'hands', 'mother', 'will', 'blame', 'babysitters', 'death', 'put', 'box', 'note', 'leave', 'mortuary', 'only', 'discover', 'money', 'mother', 'left', 'was', 'babysitter', 'discuss', 'options', 'blackmailing', 'no-good', 'father', 'going', 'mother', 'freinds', 'obvious', 'someone', 'get', 'job', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'Desperate', 'resume', 'job', 'working', 'clothing', 'company', 'where', 'enemy', 'secretary', 'who', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'job', 'Meanwhile', 'home', 'brother', 'Kenny', 'time', 'hanging', 'out', 'freinds', 'smoking', 'weed', 'being', 'around', 'louse', 'younger', 'sibs', 'steal', 'petty', 'cash', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'when', 'youngest', 'breaks', 'leg', 'Kenny', 'start', 'take', 'responsibility', 'make', 'matters', 'even', 'worse', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'can', 'use', 'house', 'fashion', 'show', 'make', 'clear', 'siblings', 'were', 'as', 'guilty', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'clean', 'up', 'house', 'help', ""'d"", 'make', 'sure', 'summer', 'freedom', 'winter', 'prison', 'end', 'two', 'eldest', 'Kenny', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'learn', 'more', 'being', 'adults', 'then', 'freedom', 'giving', 'orders', 'kids', 'ending', 'up', 'responsibility', 'realization', 'somebody', 'make', 'money', 'everyone', 'can', 'eat', 'somebody', 'clean', 'house', 'somebody', 'cook.A', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'wait', 'kids', 'are', 'teens', 'say', 'least']",N/A

But now, it's a pretty stupid flick. Not only the premise is impossible, it just wouldn't work. First of all, Christina Applegate, who gained fame from her work in Married with Children, was twenty years old when she did the film, making her look older than the supposed 17 year old character she plays. Secondly, her character has only high school education and was going to apply to a community college reveals the fact that she is a pretty dumb person. Thus, there is no way that she would have pulled it off after a day of work there. Also, cuing in Melanie Griffith from Working Girl, notice Christina Applegate walking through the city in high heels...hmmm....impossible. Third of all, honestly...why would one person do a great mass of work for another person? That just won't work. Fourth of all, pretending to be all that the resume says, it wouldn't work if Christina's character doesn't have the vocabulary and work lingo to go with the position that she is in. Anyone can see the fraud in her. What happened to reference checks or work background checks including diploma checks and criminal background checks? Anyway, all of the characters are unlikable, and the romance story between Swell (you have to be kidding me if that's her name) and the Clown Corn Dog employee is dumb and boring to watch. To fix up the house for a fashion show (whoa...check out the ugly clothes; they are uniforms??), that costs a lot of money to do that, and to do it in few days considering how messy the house looks, it's impossible. A lot of the scenes in Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead has the dreadful made-for-TV feel. If you can believe it (probably not), one of the five kids, the habitual thief and who bought a diamond ring for a girl, was a real-life drug addict (dabbled a lot during the filming also) and died in the year of 2000. The acting throughout the film was somewhat poor.

556466,A1LBF5XZNYD6QR,B00004XMVA,Brett Johnson,"[4, 4]","&quot;Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter's Dead&quot; has never been given the respect it deserves.  I think that is due to the obvious two reasons.  First...the title.  It's rather silly and it makes the movie appear to be aimed at the kiddie market which isn't really the case.  Second...Christina Applegate.  She's always been known as the ditzy blonde on &quot;Married...With Children&quot; and a lot of people haven't taken notice of what a fine actress she is.Those two reasons have probably kept many from watching this film and that's a real shame.  It's a real winner of a story once you get past the corny beginning.  Sue Ellen (Christina Applegate) and her younger siblings are left under the watchful eye of an elderly babysitter when their mom leaves the country for a couple of months.  As the title suggests, the babysitter soon passes away.  To make matters worse, the kids are left without any money and Sue Ellen has to get a job to support the family.OK...I realize that this premise probably doesn't have you in a frenzy to see it.  However, it quickly evolves into a film which is both extremely humorous and touching.  Sue Ellen gets a job at a uniform manufacturer and her boss, Rose, is delightfully played by Joanna Cassidy.  Cassidy gives her role an amazing spark that you'll have to see to understand.  Just watching her and listening to her laugh puts an instant smile on my face.  Sue Ellen also develops a relationship with a young man named Bryan (Josh Charles) who works at a fast food joint.  I was honestly surprised with the amount of care that was given in regards to the romantic side of the movie.  You are shown two people that you truly care about and you want to see them stay madly in love.The supporting cast does a solid job as well.  All of Sue Ellen's co-workers (including David Duchovny!) are very well cast.  The younger actors, including Keith Coogan, also hold their own playing the siblings.  It all culminates in an ending that is both inspirational and moving.  If you are considering watching this movie than I would urge you to do so.

Luckily, her tyranny is cut short after less than a day with her sudden death.Rather than calling the authorities, the children dispose of her in front of a funeral home, and the oldest child, Sue Ellen(Christina Applegate), takes a job at a hot dog stand when they discover that the money their mother left for household expenses was with the corpse.Sue Ellen's co-worker and High School sweetheart, Bryan (Josh Charles),tries to rekindle a romance. But Sue Ellen moves on, using a fake resume to get a job with a fashion firm. She is mistakenly employed as an executive when she only wanted the receptionist's position. But her new boss, Rose Linsey, (Joanna Cassidy)is deeply impressed. Rose is dating co-worker, Gus (John Getz), who makes advances towards the pretty ingenue. Co workers Bruce, and Cathy (David Duchovny, Kimmy Robertson) try to discredit Sue Ellen.At home Sue Ellen's brother Kenny ( Keith Coogan, with the acting chops of grandfather Jackie) begins a transition from a pot smoking slacker to an efficient household manager and cook. Younger siblings, including softball player, Melissa, lovelorn Zach, and adventerous Walter (Danielle Harris, Christopher Pettiet, and Robert Hy Gorman) fall in line as well.Inevitably, there are critical missteps, and Sue Ellen gives herself and her siblings one more chance fore redemption before turning everyone in. Watch for a scene of Kenny and Sue Ellen sparring like an old married couple.Sue Ellen is slated to give a fashion presentation, and  with a lot of help from their friends, the Crandell kids pull it off brilliantly.But Sue Ellen's lies are soon exposed, and Mom comes home and pulls the plug.No matter. Rose expresses her gratitude for the teenager's help during the summer, and may help her get into college.Mrs. Crandell is impressed by her oldest son's reinvention of himself, and the positive aspect of this story is that the kids inspire their friends to have a sense of direction for their lives as well.The whereabouts of the babysitter's remains seem rather irrelevant in the end.",4,Summer of Maturity,1179878400,"05 23, 2007",2007,2546,"['Director', 'Stephen', 'Herek', 'writers', 'Neil', 'Landau', 'Tara', 'Ison', 'present', 'tale', 'lot', 'suspension', 'disbelief.This', '1991', 'flick', 'chaotic', 'life', 'Crandell', 'Family', 'headed', 'single', 'mother', 'Concetta', 'Tomei', 'who', 'vacation', 'Australia', 'three', 'months.She', 'five', 'children', 'care', 'octogenarian', 'Mrs.', 'Struak', 'Eda', 'Reiss', 'Merin', 'who', 'nice', 'surface', 'who', 'be', 'tyrannical', 'martinet', 'once', 'Mrs.', 'Crandell', 'Luckily', 'tyranny', 'cut', 'short', 'less', 'day', 'sudden', 'death.Rather', 'calling', 'authorities', 'children', 'dispose', 'front', 'funeral', 'home', 'oldest', 'child', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'job', 'hot', 'dog', 'stand', 'when', 'discover', 'money', 'mother', 'left', 'household', 'expenses', 'was', 'corpse.Sue', 'Ellen', 'co-worker', 'High', 'School', 'sweetheart', 'Bryan', 'Josh', 'Charles', 'rekindle', 'romance', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'using', 'fake', 'resume', 'get', 'job', 'fashion', 'firm', 'mistakenly', 'employed', 'executive', 'when', 'only', 'wanted', 'receptionist', 'position', 'new', 'boss', 'Rose', 'Linsey', 'Joanna', 'Cassidy', 'deeply', 'impressed', 'Rose', 'dating', 'co-worker', 'Gus', 'John', 'Getz', 'who', 'advances', 'pretty', 'ingenue', 'Co', 'workers', 'Bruce', 'Cathy', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'Kimmy', 'Robertson', 'try', 'discredit', 'Sue', 'Ellen.At', 'home', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'brother', 'Kenny', 'Keith', 'Coogan', 'acting', 'chops', 'grandfather', 'Jackie', 'transition', 'pot', 'smoking', 'slacker', 'efficient', 'household', 'manager', 'cook', 'Younger', 'siblings', 'including', 'softball', 'player', 'Melissa', 'lovelorn', 'Zach', 'adventerous', 'Walter', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'Christopher', 'Pettiet', 'Robert', 'Hy', 'Gorman', 'fall', 'line', 'well.Inevitably', 'are', 'critical', 'missteps', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'siblings', 'one', 'more', 'chance', 'fore', 'redemption', 'turning', 'everyone', 'Watch', 'scene', 'Kenny', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'sparring', 'old', 'married', 'couple.Sue', 'Ellen', 'slated', 'give', 'fashion', 'presentation', 'lot', 'help', 'friends', 'Crandell', 'kids', 'pull', 'off', 'brilliantly.But', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'lies', 'are', 'soon', 'exposed', 'Mom', 'home', 'plug.No', 'matter', 'Rose', 'gratitude', 'teenager', 'help', 'summer', 'may', 'help', 'get', 'college.Mrs', 'Crandell', 'impressed', 'oldest', 'son', 'reinvention', 'positive', 'aspect', 'story', 'kids', 'inspire', 'friends', 'have', 'sense', 'direction', 'lives', 'well.The', 'whereabouts', 'babysitter', 'remains', 'seem', 'rather', 'irrelevant', 'end']",N/A

After a short-lived theatrical run, the movie made its way to cable channels, where it found a much less aggressive and forgiving audience, one that was willing to accept it as little more than a rainy-day diversion from reality.The film's sense of smarts is seriously off kilter, telling the story of four kids, all various ages, who are left by their vacationing mother with a babysitter who makes Satan seem like Betty White. The oldest of the children, 17-year-old Sue Ellen (Christina Applegate), is defiant of the rules, so when her siblings look to her for a solution, she marches straight to the sitter's room, only to find her dead in her rocker.Instead of calling the police, they tuck the corpse into a trunk and leave the cargo on the steps of a funeral home, only to discover that the money supply left by their mother was stashed in her pockets. Without any source of income, Sue Ellen takes charge by getting a job, first at a fast food joint that looks like something out of every clown-fearing person's worst nightmare, and then at a clothing manufacturer, where she manages to make her way to the top in less than two minutes of air-headed dialogue exchanges.After the babysitter dies, any and all plausibility goes right into that trunk with her body. Accepting that any situation that will take place during this film is purely fictional and outright idiotic will save you much time and frustration; they only get in the way. Sue Ellen's rise to the top seems written by preteen girls for preteen girls, eager for a success story that has some added elements of soap opera (sleazy coworker Gus making moves on Sue Ellen as well as her boss, Rose), and revenge (the spurned receptionist who sets out to ruin Sue Ellen's career and claim it for herself).But in the end, it's not all that bad after all. The movie does have a degree of lightheartedness about it, and its whimsy and delight in breaking all the rules of logic and intelligence is strangely refreshing. It's an ideal star vehicle for Applegate, and also showcases some good comedic relief from actress Joanna Cassidy, who becomes the sole reason to see the film.

I remember Appelgate playing in Married.....I never liked that show, so I am glad that she ""branched"" out to do other things. I try not to typecast her for playing Kelly on MWC.When I saw this movie on the big screen I fell in love with it. It helps me to decide to be a sucess in my life. Yes, some things that happend are far fetched.  For example, when you are a new hire, you have to show two forms of id. One of the ids would pretty much have to show a DOB. That is for taxes and getting paid.As far as Rose, I felt that she liked Sue Ellen so much that she was trying her hardest to tune out any neg. commets about her. Her chericter is very strong and helps Appelgate out a great deal. I would love to have a boss like Rose.Some reviews stated that the babysitter died to soon in the movie.  I dont really think the story line was to revolve around her. I feel that she was a ""steeping stone"" in the chericter development for the kids. I thought she was annoying and they should have found another stronger person for that role. I was glad to see her out of the picture as sson as she came into the picture.I agree with another reviewer that the DVD is for S^%T!!!! The picture is very grainny.  I watched it for the first time on my 16:9 digital T.V., and it is great need of restoration. The sound is only stero, where I have Dolby Digital sourround. I am glad that it was 16:9 ratio at least. The colors seem to run together, and the brights are not bright, nor the darks are dark either. It only looks like it was transfered to DVD form a tired out VHS tape. Pretty sad.

556511,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00004XMVA,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[28, 30]","Thinks are looking up for the Crandell children.  Mom (Concetta Tomei, ""Deep Impact"" and ""Picket Fences"") is going to Australia for two months.  Things seem like they are going to be great until a babysitter shows up.  The babysitter seems like a sweet little old lady until mom leaves.  The babysitter then turns into a militant, giving the children orders and rules and telling everyone that she will tolerate no infractions.The children can hardly believe their bad luck.  Now they will be stuck with the babysitter from hell.  After meeting to discuss their situation, the children elect Sue Ellen (also called Swell, played by Christina Applegate, ""Married with Children"") to go speak to the old lady.  Swell knocks on the old lady's bedroom door and enters when she fails to answer.  Swell discovers that one problem was solved, but another created, when she learns that the babysitter is dead.After another meeting of the children, they decide to take the old lady to a mortuary and drop her off with a note.  Unfortunately, the children neglect to remove the money their mother left from the old lady's clothes, as they learn after they return home.  Swell and brother Kenny (Keith Coogan, who starred in another classic comedy, ""Adventures in Babysitting"") decide that one of them has to get a job.  A flip of the pizza box and Swell starts looking for a job while brother Kenny hangs around the house and smokes pot.Swell's first job is at a hotdog place, where she gets the joy of cleaning out the grease pots.  Swell decides there has to be a better job she can get, so after a little creative resume writing, she lands a high-paying job as an executive administrative assistant for Rose Lindsay (Joanna Cassidy, ""Blade Runner"" and ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"").  In spite of obstacles placed in her way by a receptionist and her toady, Bruce, played by a David Duchovny before his ""X-Files"" days, Swell manages to excel in her job, accidentally learning to delegate and even design.Of course, things are not smooth sailing for working girl Swell.  There is the office letch, who keeps trying to become intimate with Swell, not knowing she is only 17 years old.  Swell is also trying to have a little romance of her own, with the brother of the receptionist who is trying to back stab Swell at the office.  Brother Kenny is more anxious to hang out with his friends than take care of his siblings and the house.  To top it all off, mom keeps calling, wondering how things are going and probably wondering why she is unable to speak to the babysitter.I would limit viewing to children at least 14 years old and above because of the behavior of the children.  You may wish to limit viewing to an even older age for some children.This movie is not only good; it is a funny and enjoyable movie for adults.  This movie is probably the best thing Christina Applegate has done to date outside of her continuing role on ""Married with Children.""  A few of the gags fall flat, but the bulk of them work, and Applegate does an excellent job of making you feel sorry for her as her dream summer becomes a nightmare, all the while laughing at the things happening around her.  As a light comedy this movie works, and is one that I will watch again.Enjoy!",4,Charming and Funny,1198972800,"12 30, 2007",2007,3250,"['Thinks', 'are', 'looking', 'up', 'Crandell', 'children', 'Mom', 'Concetta', 'Tomei', 'Deep', 'Impact', 'Picket', 'Fences', 'going', 'Australia', 'two', 'months', 'Things', 'seem', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'great', 'babysitter', 'up', 'babysitter', 'sweet', 'little', 'old', 'lady', 'mom', 'leaves', 'babysitter', 'then', 'militant', 'giving', 'children', 'orders', 'rules', 'telling', 'everyone', 'will', 'tolerate', 'infractions.The', 'children', 'can', 'hardly', 'believe', 'bad', 'luck', 'Now', 'will', 'be', 'stuck', 'babysitter', 'hell', 'meeting', 'discuss', 'situation', 'children', 'elect', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'also', 'called', 'Swell', 'played', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'Married', 'Children', 'go', 'speak', 'old', 'lady', 'Swell', 'old', 'lady', 'bedroom', 'door', 'enters', 'when', 'answer', 'Swell', 'one', 'problem', 'was', 'solved', 'created', 'when', 'babysitter', 'dead.After', 'meeting', 'children', 'decide', 'take', 'old', 'lady', 'mortuary', 'drop', 'off', 'note', 'Unfortunately', 'children', 'neglect', 'remove', 'money', 'mother', 'left', 'old', 'lady', 'clothes', 'learn', 'return', 'home', 'Swell', 'brother', 'Kenny', 'Keith', 'Coogan', 'who', 'starred', 'classic', 'comedy', 'Adventures', 'Babysitting', 'decide', 'one', 'get', 'job', 'flip', 'pizza', 'box', 'Swell', 'looking', 'job', 'brother', 'Kenny', 'house', 'pot.Swell', 'first', 'job', 'hotdog', 'place', 'where', 'joy', 'cleaning', 'out', 'grease', 'pots', 'Swell', 'there', 'be', 'better', 'job', 'can', 'get', 'so', 'little', 'creative', 'resume', 'writing', 'high-paying', 'job', 'executive', 'administrative', 'assistant', 'Rose', 'Lindsay', 'Joanna', 'Cassidy', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Who', 'Framed', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'spite', 'obstacles', 'placed', 'way', 'receptionist', 'toady', 'Bruce', 'played', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'X-Files', 'days', 'Swell', 'excel', 'job', 'accidentally', 'learning', 'delegate', 'even', 'design.Of', 'course', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'smooth', 'sailing', 'working', 'girl', 'Swell', 'office', 'letch', 'who', 'trying', 'become', 'intimate', 'Swell', 'not', 'knowing', 'only', '17', 'years', 'old', 'Swell', 'also', 'trying', 'have', 'little', 'romance', 'own', 'brother', 'receptionist', 'who', 'trying', 'back', 'stab', 'Swell', 'office', 'Brother', 'Kenny', 'more', 'anxious', 'hang', 'out', 'friends', 'take', 'care', 'siblings', 'house', 'top', 'off', 'mom', 'keeps', 'calling', 'wondering', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'probably', 'wondering', 'why', 'unable', 'speak', 'babysitter.I', 'would', 'limit', 'viewing', 'children', 'least', '14', 'years', 'old', 'above', 'behavior', 'children', 'may', 'wish', 'limit', 'viewing', 'even', 'older', 'age', 'children.This', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'good', 'funny', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'adults', 'movie', 'probably', 'best', 'thing', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'done', 'date', 'continuing', 'role', 'Married', 'Children', 'few', 'gags', 'fall', 'flat', 'bulk', 'work', 'Applegate', 'excellent', 'job', 'making', 'feel', 'sorry', 'dream', 'summer', 'nightmare', 'while', 'laughing', 'things', 'happening', 'light', 'comedy', 'movie', 'one', 'will', 'watch', 'again.Enjoy']",N/A

Well, she made this charming, highly entertaining comedy of a Los Angeles teen that finds herself in a tough predicament one summer. After her mother leaves on a two-month trip to Australia, Sue Ellen (Applegate) finds herself taking care of her four siblings after the mean, elderly babysitter that was hired by their mother for the summer drops dead from natural causes. Unwilling to put a dent to their summer fun, the kids decide to rid the body and take care of themselves for two months without having to tell their mom. Only problem is that when they dropped the body off at the local mortuary, they forgot to check the babysitter's pockets for the money their mother left for groceries for the entire summer.Determined to keep the fun and food flowing, Sue Ellen decides to look for a job. After not having too much luck at a fast food restaurant, she applies for a receptionist position at a clothing company. When a resume mix-up gets in the way, Sue Ellen becomes a career woman in order to pay the bills and keep their summer alive. Meanwhile, she develops a blossoming relationship with a fast-food worker she once worked with (Josh Charles of ""Threesome"") and is being hounded by two office workers who want to wreck her reputation (Concetta Tomei &amp; a very, very young-looking David Duchovny of ""X-Files fame).Featuring a great cast of actors such as Joanna Cassidy and Keith Coogan (""Adventures in Babysitting""), ""Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter is Dead"" is a grown-up version of ""Home Alone"" for teens. Amusing, funny, and entertaining, it was Applegate's only feature-film hit. While she made other low-cost films such as ""Streets"", this film happens to be her best work outside from her work on ""Married...With Children.."" If you are looking for a great flick for the family this is it. Please be aware that the film contains scenes of drug use (marijuana) and might be unsuitable for children under  the age of 13.",5,One Crazy Summer,977529600,"12 23, 2000",2000,2058,"['What', 'did', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'do', '1990', 'summer', 'hiatus', 'television', 'popular', 'series', 'Married', 'Children', 'Well', 'made', 'charming', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'comedy', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'teen', 'tough', 'predicament', 'one', 'summer', 'mother', 'two-month', 'trip', 'Australia', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'Applegate', 'taking', 'care', 'four', 'siblings', 'mean', 'elderly', 'babysitter', 'was', 'hired', 'mother', 'summer', 'drops', 'dead', 'natural', 'causes', 'Unwilling', 'put', 'dent', 'summer', 'fun', 'kids', 'decide', 'rid', 'body', 'take', 'care', 'two', 'months', 'having', 'tell', 'mom', 'Only', 'problem', 'when', 'dropped', 'body', 'off', 'local', 'mortuary', 'forgot', 'check', 'babysitter', 'pockets', 'money', 'mother', 'left', 'groceries', 'entire', 'summer.Determined', 'keep', 'fun', 'food', 'flowing', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'look', 'job', 'not', 'having', 'too', 'much', 'luck', 'fast', 'food', 'restaurant', 'receptionist', 'position', 'clothing', 'company', 'When', 'resume', 'mix-up', 'way', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'career', 'woman', 'order', 'pay', 'bills', 'keep', 'summer', 'alive', 'Meanwhile', 'blossoming', 'relationship', 'fast-food', 'worker', 'once', 'worked', 'Josh', 'Charles', 'Threesome', 'being', 'hounded', 'two', 'office', 'workers', 'who', 'want', 'wreck', 'reputation', 'Concetta', 'Tomei', 'amp', 'very', 'very', 'young-looking', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'X-Files', 'fame', '.Featuring', 'great', 'cast', 'actors', 'such', 'Joanna', 'Cassidy', 'Keith', 'Coogan', 'Adventures', 'Babysitting', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Tell', 'Mom', 'Babysitter', 'Dead', 'grown-up', 'version', 'Home', 'Alone', 'teens', 'Amusing', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'was', 'Applegate', 'only', 'feature-film', 'hit', 'made', 'other', 'low-cost', 'films', 'such', 'Streets', 'film', 'be', 'best', 'work', 'work', 'Married', 'Children..', 'are', 'looking', 'great', 'flick', 'family', 'Please', 'be', 'aware', 'film', 'scenes', 'drug', 'use', 'marijuana', 'might', 'be', 'unsuitable', 'children', 'age', '13']",N/A

To cope, she finds an ad for a fashion designer and replies with a fake resume and enters the corporate world of a fashion company. She even gets as far as having a fashion show (repleate with bad 1980's style clothes) and getting hit on by a fellow co-worker who thinks she's over age.

It shows that when you work hard and work together how you can get something done. When Sue Ellen, Walter, Kenny, and Melissa's mother goes to Australia for the summer they are left home with a babysitter. She's not any ordinary babysitter, she's and old lady that is rule oriented and is very, very strict. The kids decide that they have had enough and when Sue Ellen, the oldest of the kids, goes down to talk to her, she is found dead. They have no money and Sue Ellen is working for a clothing company for the summer. Thus starts a funny and often touching comedy.At the beginning of this film, Sue Ellen has a bad attitude, along with her siblings, about their whole summer. Sue Ellen gets a high position in the clothing company by submitting a made up resume and the job is tedious and very hard. As the movie progresses, she is developed into the young woman that she really is and disovers for herslf how she can accomplish things. She's not the only one that changes. Her brother, Kenny, is a delinquent at the start of the movie as he hangs with the wrong crowd and is off every night using drugs. By the end of the film he changes into a courteous young man that has respect not only for the people and things around him, but for most importantly, himself. The whole family works as a team during their summer and at the end of the movie you know the signifigance of hard work and effort among a group.The comedy in this film is very good and you'll be having a belly laugh every few minutes. This is a comedy that is great for the whole family to sit down to and enjoy. It is funny, touching, and gives great messages. Not many other comedies can do that. this is heartily recommended to the lover of a great comedy or a film with great messages.",5,It's Not Funny How Many Times I've Seen This...,1018051200,"04 6, 2002",2002,1827,"['Do', ""n't"", 'Tell', 'Mom', 'Babysitter', 'Dead', 'all-time', 'comedy', 'great', 'when', 'work', 'hard', 'work', 'together', 'how', 'can', 'get', 'something', 'done', 'When', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'Walter', 'Kenny', 'Melissa', 'mother', 'Australia', 'summer', 'are', 'left', 'home', 'babysitter', 'not', 'ordinary', 'babysitter', 'old', 'lady', 'rule', 'oriented', 'very', 'very', 'strict', 'kids', 'decide', 'have', 'had', 'enough', 'when', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'oldest', 'kids', 'down', 'talk', 'found', 'dead', 'have', 'money', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'working', 'clothing', 'company', 'summer', 'Thus', 'funny', 'often', 'touching', 'comedy.At', 'beginning', 'film', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'bad', 'attitude', 'siblings', 'whole', 'summer', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'high', 'position', 'clothing', 'company', 'submitting', 'made', 'up', 'resume', 'job', 'tedious', 'very', 'hard', 'movie', 'developed', 'young', 'woman', 'really', 'disovers', 'herslf', 'how', 'can', 'accomplish', 'things', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'brother', 'Kenny', 'delinquent', 'start', 'movie', 'wrong', 'crowd', 'off', 'night', 'using', 'drugs', 'end', 'film', 'courteous', 'young', 'man', 'respect', 'not', 'only', 'people', 'things', 'most', 'importantly', 'whole', 'family', 'team', 'summer', 'end', 'movie', 'know', 'signifigance', 'hard', 'work', 'effort', 'group.The', 'comedy', 'film', 'very', 'good', ""'ll"", 'be', 'having', 'belly', 'laugh', 'few', 'minutes', 'comedy', 'great', 'whole', 'family', 'sit', 'down', 'enjoy', 'funny', 'touching', 'great', 'messages', 'Not', 'many', 'other', 'comedies', 'can', 'do', 'heartily', 'recommended', 'lover', 'great', 'comedy', 'film', 'great', 'messages']",N/A

Nowadays, it's dull. These are the thoughts that come to mind whenever I view this movie.The plot snypnosis are as follows and plainly simple. Five kids are being baby-sat by a sinister old lady while their mom goes away on a trip in Australia. But early into the film, the old bag croaks on them. The kids, not knowing what to do exactly, put the woman in a foot locker (it looks like one) and dump it off at the nearest morgue or mortuary. The mother left money for them, but they find that there isn't any... they soon realized that the old lady had it with her the whole time. To gain money, the two older kids, Sue Ellen (Applegate) and Kenny (Keith Coogan), flip to decide who gets a job. Sue Ellen ends up finding a job. Kenny on the other hand has to do housework and take care of the kids... but he's a lazy bum that only ""tokes it"" with his other stoner buddies.Sue Ellen gets a job at a clothing design company. She turns in a resume that's not necessarily true (who doesn't do this?) and gets immediately hired by the head honcho Rose Lindsey (played by the wonderful and beautiful Joanna Cassidy). Unfortunately, Sue Ellen runs into a competition with a co-worker named Carolyn (played by Jayne Brook). In truth, Carolyn wanted to get the position that Sue Ellen got and is not too pleased with that. Carolyn has a side-kick named Bruce (David Duchovny) and both strive to expose Sue Ellen for who she really is: a phony. Rose absolutely adores Sue Ellen and not once gets after her. She loves her too much. And Rose has a man of her own named Gus (John Getz), who unfortunately became attracted to Sue Ellen on first sight.The kids strive to survive on their own for the summer. Naturally, they run into some problems along the way, but they manage to stick together. It's basically one of those kiddie fantasies where they can run amuck without any adults to ruin the fun.It's good for teenagers and kids, but it may seem dated to today's standard. At times, you'll find it cheesy (can you believe that us guys ran around saying ""ROCK AND ROLL!"" when we're energetic and enthusiastic?) and the designs may be outrageous to some. Oh well, expect yourself to find today's style dated in a few years. The ending is of course so cliched, almost ""Risky Business""-like, but still enjoyable.The hidden gem found in this movie is change, most notably in the two older teenagers. They miraculously matured based from what they've done, especially the brother. He went from some grungy stoner to a well-attired young gentleman. And instead of completely neglecting school, he decides to continue his education and even plans to pursue college. Sue Ellen became more responsible by paying more attention to her family rather than just looks, boys, and partying. She also pays more attention to her job in the end, which also resulted in actually saving the jobs of many people and even the business.So don't write it off as some crappy teen comedy. At least it has a better message than most teen movies.",3,Huh... hmm... hmmmmm....,1102809600,"12 12, 2004",2004,3506,"['was', 'movie', 'sister', 'always', 'watched', 'back', 'hey-day', 'watched', 'along', 'as', 'well', 'thought', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'was', 'purty', 'Hey', 'was', 'kid', 'back', 'then', 'Who', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'attractive', 'looking', 'never', 'realized', 'outrageous', 'clothes', 'women', 'wore', 'Did', 'really', 'reflect', 'era', 'Not', 'find', 'clothes', 'be', 'horrendous', 'just', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'flashy', 'guess', 'mixture', 'grunge', 'fashion', 'Ahh', 'early', 'nineties', 'was', 'such', 'fantastic', 'era', 'Nowadays', 'dull', 'are', 'thoughts', 'come', 'mind', 'whenever', 'view', 'movie.The', 'plot', 'snypnosis', 'are', 'plainly', 'simple', 'Five', 'kids', 'are', 'being', 'baby-sat', 'sinister', 'old', 'lady', 'mom', 'away', 'trip', 'Australia', 'early', 'film', 'old', 'bag', 'croaks', 'kids', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'do', 'exactly', 'put', 'woman', 'foot', 'locker', 'one', 'dump', 'off', 'nearest', 'morgue', 'mortuary', 'mother', 'left', 'money', 'find', ""n't"", 'soon', 'realized', 'old', 'lady', 'had', 'whole', 'time', 'gain', 'money', 'two', 'older', 'kids', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'Applegate', 'Kenny', 'Keith', 'Coogan', 'flip', 'decide', 'who', 'job', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'up', 'finding', 'job', 'Kenny', 'other', 'hand', 'do', 'housework', 'take', 'care', 'kids', 'lazy', 'bum', 'only', 'tokes', 'other', 'stoner', 'Ellen', 'job', 'clothing', 'design', 'company', 'resume', 'not', 'necessarily', 'true', 'who', ""n't"", 'do', 'immediately', 'hired', 'head', 'honcho', 'Rose', 'Lindsey', 'played', 'wonderful', 'beautiful', 'Joanna', 'Cassidy', 'Unfortunately', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'competition', 'co-worker', 'named', 'Carolyn', 'played', 'Jayne', 'Brook', 'truth', 'Carolyn', 'wanted', 'get', 'position', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'got', 'not', 'too', 'pleased', 'Carolyn', 'side-kick', 'named', 'Bruce', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'strive', 'expose', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'who', 'really', 'phony', 'Rose', 'absolutely', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'not', 'once', 'too', 'much', 'Rose', 'man', 'own', 'named', 'Gus', 'John', 'Getz', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'became', 'attracted', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'first', 'sight.The', 'kids', 'strive', 'survive', 'own', 'summer', 'Naturally', 'run', 'problems', 'way', 'manage', 'stick', 'together', 'basically', 'one', 'kiddie', 'fantasies', 'where', 'can', 'run', 'amuck', 'adults', 'ruin', 'fun.It', 'good', 'teenagers', 'kids', 'may', 'seem', 'dated', 'today', 'standard', 'times', ""'ll"", 'find', 'cheesy', 'can', 'believe', 'guys', 'ran', 'saying', 'ROCK', 'AND', 'ROLL', 'when', ""'re"", 'energetic', 'enthusiastic', 'designs', 'may', 'be', 'outrageous', 'Oh', 'well', 'expect', 'find', 'today', 'style', 'dated', 'few', 'years', 'ending', 'course', 'so', 'cliched', 'almost', 'Risky', 'Business', '-like', 'still', 'enjoyable.The', 'hidden', 'gem', 'found', 'movie', 'change', 'most', 'notably', 'two', 'older', 'teenagers', 'miraculously', 'matured', 'based', 'what', ""'ve"", 'done', 'especially', 'brother', 'went', 'grungy', 'stoner', 'well-attired', 'young', 'gentleman', 'instead', 'completely', 'neglecting', 'school', 'continue', 'education', 'even', 'plans', 'pursue', 'college', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'became', 'more', 'responsible', 'paying', 'more', 'attention', 'family', 'rather', 'just', 'looks', 'boys', 'partying', 'also', 'more', 'attention', 'job', 'end', 'also', 'resulted', 'actually', 'saving', 'jobs', 'many', 'people', 'even', 'business.So', 'do', ""n't"", 'write', 'off', 'crappy', 'teen', 'comedy', 'least', 'better', 'message', 'most', 'teen', 'movies']",N/A
