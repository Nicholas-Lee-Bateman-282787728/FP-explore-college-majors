Jordan)and the incredibly short running time-83 minutes.I have to admit,my favorite part was when the boys were playing catch football while flying superman-style in the sky.I am surprised that ""Chronicle"" only cost $15 million(even more shocked at how much it made:over $120 million at the box office),and filmed in South Africa-doubling for Seattle,WA.Long story short,""Chronicle"" might not deserve multiple viewings(you might get bored looking at it the third or fourth time around),but I would recommend it to anyone.Note-the scenes with Andrew (DeHaan) may be a little hard to watch for anyone who had a hellish home life and/or rough time in high school.The visuals do not get in the way of the story and you sense the friendships and happiness that Andrew has-until it all falls down.",4,"An Intriguing and Tragic ""Chronicle""",1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,1343,"['Chronicle', 'one', 'movies', 'made', 'want', 'go', 'see', 'just', 'constant', 't.v', 'spots', 'Fox', 'ran', 'weeks', 'leading', 'up', 'release', '3', 'months', 'ago.But', 'depending', 'who', 'ask', 'who', 'went', 'go', 'see', 'was', 'hit', 'miss.In', 'opinion', 'much', 'credit', 'be', 'given', 'filmmakers', 'Josh', 'Trank', 'Max', 'Landis', 'coming', 'up', 'premise', 'did', ""n't"", 'sound', 'so', 'exciting', 'superhero-like', 'film', 'wrapped', 'teen', 'drama', 'found', 'footage', 'format', 'worked', 'given', 'performances', '3', 'boys', 'notably', 'Dane', 'DeHaan', 'Michael', 'B.', 'Jordan', 'incredibly', 'short', 'running', 'time-83', 'minutes.I', 'have', 'admit', 'favorite', 'part', 'was', 'when', 'boys', 'were', 'playing', 'catch', 'football', 'flying', 'superman-style', 'sky.I', 'am', 'surprised', 'Chronicle', 'only', 'cost', '15', 'million', 'even', 'more', 'shocked', 'how', 'much', 'made', '120', 'million', 'box', 'office', 'filmed', 'South', 'Africa-doubling', 'Seattle', 'WA.Long', 'story', 'short', 'Chronicle', 'might', 'not', 'deserve', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'might', 'get', 'bored', 'looking', 'third', 'fourth', 'time', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone.Note-the', 'scenes', 'Andrew', 'DeHaan', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'hard', 'watch', 'anyone', 'who', 'had', 'hellish', 'home', 'life', 'rough', 'time', 'high', 'school.The', 'visuals', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'way', 'story', 'sense', 'friendships', 'happiness', 'Andrew', 'has-until', 'down']",Chronicle

1464912,A2AVV9LV9UXT6F,B005LAIGPA,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","I have recently watched three ""found footage"" films, and come to the conclusion that I will probably avoid them in future.  This is a shame, as I am sure the genre is here to stay, like reality TV (which also ought to go away), thanks to its lower production costs.  It's come to seem too gimmicky for my taste.  I haven't seen one yet which, the story being good, wouldn't have been a lot more enjoyable had it been shot as a conventional film.  This film is no exception.  And it's a real shame, because I love the story.  It's particularly timely with the spate of superhero films we've been treated to recently, and it's an interesting twist on the idea of a geeky, introverted, loner kid suddenly gifted with super powers that Stan Lee popularized back in the '60s with Peter Parker/Spider-Man.  This time, the geeky, introverted, loner kid doesn't become the hero, he becomes the villain, and the film very believably depicts why this is.  Andrew Detmer, like Peter Parker, is a shy, unpopular kid in his school, but that's about as far as the similarity goes.  Unlike Peter Parker, Andrew doesn't have a loving, supportive family to hold him up, instill decent values and respect for others into him, and give him a solid moral foundation.  His mother might do this, but the terminal illness she'd battling makes her unable to, and effectively isolates Andrew from the one person who would or could.  Her eventual loss will only reinforce Andrew's sense of the world as a profoundly inhospitable and unfair place.  Andrew's father, an abusive alcoholic, is as far from a loving and supportive parent as he could be, and the torrent of scorn and contempt he pours on the kid only increases Andrew's sense of isolation and alienation.  Combine this with the bullying he undergoes at school, and it's no wonder that, as the film develops, Andrew displays a marked lack of empathy or respect for other people.  When this embittered, isolated boy suddenly finds himself possessing godlike powers, it's no wonder that he feels little restraint in lashing out at what seems to him a cold, uncaring world.  His cousin Matt, and popular fellow student Steve, with happier homes and upbringings, are better grounded morally, and better adjusted socially, and thus better able to resist the corrupting influence of this power.This is a great story idea, and it builds up to an appropriately dramatic climax.  What a pity then that the makers of this film chose to tell it through the limited lens of ""found footage.""  I dislike FF films because, for starters, they simply don't move as smoothly.  Far too many scenes (no doubt for verisimilitude) are of boring people doing boring things, like the vast majority of home movies.  I also miss the musical score of a traditional film, which, when good, can enormously enhance the drama, suspense, scariness, or humor of any given scene.  Another problem is that the nature of medium makes it harder to identify with the characters; ordinary people always act different when talking to a camera, and so the characters come across different.  FF, therefore, tends to make effective character development much harder.  FF limits the perspective to the single, supposedly amateur camera, which often causes problems in exposition.  And finally, the number one problem with these films is that I have yet to see one that didn't reach a point (usually pretty early in the film at that) where I didn't ask ""why would anyone still be filming at this point?""  Either you have to wonder at people who are ALWAYS filming, no matter how boring, trivial, or mundane the activity they are recording (and most people don't know anyone who does this), or when the action really gets going, and lives are in danger, you wonder why the character behind the camera would still be concerned about continuing the filming when his very life is on the line.  Either way, it doesn't seem very credible, and hurts suspension of disbelief.  I can't think of a single found footage film that I REALLY enjoyed. The style always seems not only to limit the way in which the story can be told, it also seems to magnify problems like bad acting and bad direction. It simply doesn't work for me, and the final result never feels believable in the way that it seems like it should be, and the makers obviously intend it to be.  Even in the case of this movie, the end result was a film whose story I liked, but I probably won't ever care to watch again, whereas if it had been shot as a conventional movie, I'd probably eagerly add it to my video library.",3,"Great story, but ENOUGH with the ""found footage"" already!",1343952000,"08 3, 2012",2012,4565,"['have', 'recently', 'watched', 'three', 'found', 'footage', 'films', 'come', 'conclusion', 'will', 'probably', 'avoid', 'future', 'shame', 'am', 'sure', 'genre', 'here', 'stay', 'reality', 'TV', 'also', 'ought', 'go', 'away', 'thanks', 'lower', 'production', 'costs', 'come', 'seem', 'too', 'gimmicky', 'taste', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'one', 'yet', 'story', 'being', 'good', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'had', 'been', 'shot', 'conventional', 'film', 'film', 'exception', 'real', 'shame', 'love', 'story', 'particularly', 'timely', 'spate', 'superhero', 'films', ""'ve"", 'been', 'treated', 'recently', 'interesting', 'twist', 'idea', 'geeky', 'introverted', 'loner', 'kid', 'suddenly', 'gifted', 'super', 'powers', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'popularized', 'back', ""'60s"", 'Peter', 'Parker/Spider-Man', 'time', 'geeky', 'introverted', 'loner', 'kid', ""n't"", 'become', 'hero', 'villain', 'film', 'very', 'believably', 'why', 'Andrew', 'Detmer', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'shy', 'unpopular', 'kid', 'school', 'about', 'as', 'far', 'similarity', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Andrew', ""n't"", 'have', 'loving', 'supportive', 'family', 'hold', 'up', 'instill', 'decent', 'values', 'respect', 'others', 'give', 'solid', 'moral', 'foundation', 'mother', 'might', 'do', 'terminal', 'illness', ""'d"", 'battling', 'unable', 'effectively', 'isolates', 'Andrew', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'would', 'could', 'eventual', 'loss', 'will', 'only', 'reinforce', 'Andrew', 'sense', 'world', 'profoundly', 'inhospitable', 'unfair', 'place', 'Andrew', 'father', 'abusive', 'alcoholic', 'far', 'loving', 'supportive', 'parent', 'could', 'be', 'torrent', 'scorn', 'contempt', 'kid', 'only', 'Andrew', 'sense', 'isolation', 'alienation', 'Combine', 'bullying', 'school', 'wonder', 'that', 'film', 'Andrew', 'marked', 'lack', 'empathy', 'respect', 'other', 'people', 'When', 'embittered', 'isolated', 'boy', 'suddenly', 'possessing', 'godlike', 'powers', 'wonder', 'little', 'restraint', 'lashing', 'out', 'what', 'cold', 'uncaring', 'world', 'cousin', 'Matt', 'popular', 'fellow', 'student', 'Steve', 'happier', 'homes', 'upbringings', 'are', 'better', 'grounded', 'morally', 'better', 'adjusted', 'socially', 'thus', 'better', 'able', 'resist', 'corrupting', 'influence', 'power.This', 'great', 'story', 'idea', 'up', 'appropriately', 'dramatic', 'climax', 'What', 'pity', 'then', 'makers', 'film', 'chose', 'tell', 'limited', 'lens', 'found', 'footage', 'dislike', 'FF', 'films', 'because', 'starters', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'move', 'smoothly', 'Far', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'doubt', 'verisimilitude', 'are', 'boring', 'people', 'doing', 'boring', 'things', 'vast', 'majority', 'home', 'movies', 'also', 'miss', 'musical', 'score', 'traditional', 'film', 'when', 'good', 'can', 'enormously', 'enhance', 'drama', 'suspense', 'scariness', 'humor', 'given', 'scene', 'problem', 'nature', 'medium', 'harder', 'identify', 'characters', 'ordinary', 'people', 'always', 'act', 'different', 'when', 'talking', 'camera', 'so', 'characters', 'come', 'different', 'FF', 'therefore', 'make', 'effective', 'character', 'development', 'much', 'harder', 'FF', 'perspective', 'single', 'supposedly', 'amateur', 'camera', 'often', 'problems', 'exposition', 'finally', 'number', 'one', 'problem', 'films', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'reach', 'point', 'usually', 'pretty', 'early', 'film', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'ask', 'why', 'would', 'anyone', 'still', 'be', 'filming', 'point', 'have', 'wonder', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'ALWAYS', 'filming', 'matter', 'how', 'boring', 'trivial', 'mundane', 'activity', 'are', 'recording', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'who', 'when', 'action', 'really', 'going', 'lives', 'are', 'danger', 'wonder', 'why', 'character', 'camera', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'concerned', 'continuing', 'filming', 'when', 'very', 'life', 'line', 'way', ""n't"", 'seem', 'very', 'credible', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'single', 'found', 'footage', 'film', 'REALLY', 'enjoyed', 'style', 'always', 'not', 'only', 'limit', 'way', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'told', 'also', 'magnify', 'problems', 'bad', 'acting', 'bad', 'direction', 'simply', ""n't"", 'work', 'final', 'result', 'never', 'believable', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'makers', 'obviously', 'intend', 'be', 'Even', 'case', 'movie', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'film', 'story', 'liked', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'care', 'watch', 'again', 'had', 'been', 'shot', 'conventional', 'movie', ""'d"", 'probably', 'eagerly', 'add', 'video', 'library']",Chronicle

1464915,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B005LAIGPA,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","The whole hand held camera phase has become this big thing that you either love or you hate.  Many are vocal about hating it entirely and wishing that it had never been started.  I'm not one of those.  I mean, I am not a giant fan of it but I understand its purpose and find that the gimmick, when used correctly, can be fun.  I loved `Cloverfield'.  Maybe too much, but then again I'm not ashamed of that at all.  Many blame `Cloverfield' for the craze, and they are probably partially justified since that film did become a sort of `thing' for a while.Hate on the gimmick all you want, but `Chronicle' proves that it can be utilized to seeming perfection.`Chronicle' is a story of three teens who stumble across what appears to be an alien entity that gives them bizarre powers of mind control that allow them to become superheroes.  What teenage boy doesn't want to do that.  What `Chronicle' explores after the initial power surge is the impact that power has on the weak and the way it warps the mind and eventually controls it.  As a whole, it does a decent job of that.  The performances are well grounded, especially from Dane DeHaan who grapples with the darkness aspect of the transformation really well.  I was really impressed with the special effects, which were NOT perfect, but considering the budget and the overall visual scope of the film, they were truly effective.The finale builds in a really aggressive nature.  I liked that.  Still, there is something missing here.  As much as I liked this film, it felt almost as if the themes present weren't completely manipulated correctly, like it was enough just to present them and not necessarily develop them.Still, I highly recommend it.

1464922,A2582KMXLK2P06,B005LAIGPA,B. E Jackson,"[4, 4]","Action/adventure, huh?  More like suspense/horror with elements of drama!  Chronicle is one of the craziest films I've seen in a while.  It's about three teenage boys who happen to stumble across telekinesis powers hidden deep in the ground that was apparently brought to earth by aliens (though it was never actually stated but we can only assume since all logic points to alien creatures).  When the teens leaves the hole... let's just say, they'll never be the same again!  The movie takes the familiar theme of having one of the characters walk around holding a home video camera, which reminds me of the Blair Witch Project but a *thousand* times more exciting and suspenseful.Some of these segments will truly blow your mind.  Everything from money being ejected from a cash register, to a bus way up high in the air flying through a building, to the teenagers learning they have the ability to fly, to windows exploding and police officers and cars flying backwards... everything that makes special effects entertaining is right here.  These powers are also used to trick people such as a lady who comes out of a grocery store and discovers that her vehicle had been parked in another spot, lol.  The boys also use these powers in a negative way such as pushing an impatient driver off the road and over a guardrail.  Not to mention they find out the hard way what happens when they exploit these special powers and believe they're unstoppable.  Let's just say, the consequences will HAVE to be taken into consideration then.The one thing that sort of bugs me is that the teen whose mother was lying hopelessly sick in bed... shouldn't he have at least *tried* to use his special powers to save her life?  Anyway this same boy has a father (or stepfather) who's an absolute jerk and doesn't mind smacking his son around, and the telekinesis powers are most rewarding during this segment.  Whereas the first 10 minutes are really boring and lousy, the final 20 minutes that show the ultimate confrontation on the streets of Seattle are enough to elevate the overall rating to 5 solid stars.

Andrew and his friends discover an object hidden deep beneath the earth that endows each of them with extraordinary abilities, but as they soon learn, with great power comes great responsibility. CHRONICLE is their story, as told from Andrew's camcorder. The use of the first-person perspective in this is both a blessing and a curse, as always. It is often difficult to accept the footage as fact when it is so cleanly shot and scripted, which prevents the complete suspension of belief. As a work of pure fantasy, however, it pushes the concept to its veritable extremes, exploring the psychology of the super hero from an entirely new perspective. Andrew, Matt, and Steve take us through their daily lives, the challenges they face as teenagers, and show us just how thin the line is between good and evil. Little pranks have costly results, and without constant restraint, their virtually-limitless abilities quickly grow out of control.

1464943,A3QIW6ULPIPM2V,B005LAIGPA,Chip Kaufmann,"[1, 1]","Like a number of people who have reviewed this movie, I am not a fan of the ""found footage"" film, a genre made popular by THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and several other low budget horror films. It's not the budget I object to, it's what's done with it and CHRONICLE passes that test with flying colors. In fact after watching it you'd be hard pressed to believe that the film was made for only $12 million. Part of that is due to the fact that the film was mostly shot in Cape Town, South Africa. It also uses a cast of unknowns so there are no inflated salaries to contend with. The most significant fact is that CGI has developed to such a sophisticated degree that it can be employed inexpensively by someone who knows what they're doing. CHRONICLE is one of those little films where everything comes together to create a minor masterpiece.The story is a familiar one. It follows the exploits of three high school friends whose exposure to a mysterious object (it's never explained what it is) causes them to develop super powers such as telekinesis and the ability to fly. One of them, Andrew (Dean DeHaan), has been videotaping all their exploits. This accounts for the title and for the found footage aspect which cleverly disappears 30 minutes into the film. Andrew is like a male version of CARRIE. He is bullied at school and has a terrible home life to come home to. At first the three friends have fun with their new found abilities but things get darker as Andrew's problems mount. He eventually spirals out of control before one of the friends (Alex Russell), who happens to be his cousin, is forced to confront him which results in wrecking most of downtown Seattle.The performances are one of the best things about CHRONICLE. Since the actors are relatively unknown, their characters come across as real and the dialogue sounds suitably contemporary. Another virtue is that the film runs only 83 minutes so everything is really tight. It's like the B movie of yore where making the most out of the least was the principal challenge the filmmaker faced. After it's initial run the film had grossed $125 million worldwide, a pretty good return on a $12 million dollar investment. To me that's what moviemaking should be all about. The smaller the budget the more creative you have to be and the greater the profit can be as well. At $250 million, THE DARK KNIGHT RISES will be lucky to make 4 times what it cost.

But I will say that I do recommend this movie wholeheartedly because it is a solid ""superhero movie"" from a different angle.Now if you don't know who Max Landis you should correct that right away. Just Google ""The Death and Return of Superman"". It's a 15 min. video about the comic story arc dealing with the issue where Superman dies/is killed off by Marvel comics. It is brilliant and I watched it no less than 10 times. But the reason that's important is because Max is the writer of Chronicle. Now I didn't know Max as a writer and whatnot before The Death and Return of Superman. But I've been following him ever since and I think is going to be somebody that in the future of Hollywood will do amazing things. Now why is this important?Because he wrote Chronicle and the story is compelling and interesting and keeps you wondering what will happen next. But the thing I like best is the character development. See to me I judge a movie based on how much I care about the characters and what happens to them. So many movies today skimp on character development and thus leaves me feeling like I really don't care what happens to you main character, Go-ahead run off and get killed by giant menacing robots or attacked by bloodthirsty piranha I don't care what happens to you or the rest of the people in your party.  but that is why I like this movie so much Chronicle had me wondering what would happen to these people that I had an emotional interest in and I think that is the true mark of a good movie.So that being said I recommend not watching the trailer for this movie go into a blind and you'll be much happier I think with the result. If you seen the trailer (I think they give too much away nowadays) still check this movie out if you like character development and decent story. I'm a fan but I'm Uptomyknees in like with Max Landis!Oh and by the way this movie I will re-watch in the future and that really is the foundation for a movie for me, would I watch it again.

Andrew Detmer is a senior in highschool, he&#8217;s a virgin, loner, picked on, and on top of that has an alcoholic father and a mother dealing with terminal cancer. One day, Andrew&#8217;s cousin Matt takes him to a party and along with his friend Steve they discover a whole in the ground. When they go into the hole, the three of them discover a glowing rock which give them the power of telekinesis. At first they are only able to move small objects: lego pieces, coins, etc. They then discover that their new power is like a muscle and the more they use it the more powerful it is. They move on to being able to move larger and larger objects like dolls, supermarket carts, and finally a car. Andrew discovers that he can protect himself from objects by imagining an invisible shield, Mike discovers that they can fly by pushing themselves above the ground. Andrew goes from feeling lonely to feeling like he is high on life. I enjoyed how the director took his time in expanding the discovery of the powers. Every kid likes to imagine what it would be like to develop super powers and it was good that the director spent half the movie focused on that because for me, that&#8217;s the magical part. Just as things look like they&#8217;re going well, Andrew&#8217;s dad is suspicious of how he spends his time, tries to beat the s*** out of him and mom takes a turn for the worse. Andrew is angry, flies off and calls up a storm. Mike tries to  rescue him but Andrew unwittingly kills him with lightning. Andrew starts robbing stores for money in order to buy medicine for his mom, and when she dies, and his dad rages on him, he goes crazy. He uses his powers against the police and innocent bystanders and finally, his cousin, Steve has to kill him to stop him. It&#8217;s not a thinking man&#8217;s movie, but it doesn&#8217;t try to be, it&#8217;s fun, action packed and takes me to recall dreams of my youth.

1464952,A1JUF6RWAIAFY1,B005LAIGPA,Cool Breeze,"[4, 7]","I have watched many superhero origin films throughout the years.  Many have been great (Iron Man, X-Men & Batman Begins) and many have been awful (Daredevil and Green Lantern). All of these films are different in an assorted number of ways, but they all have one commonality: a nascent superhero's initial revulsion towards his/her special abilities, (this includes Batman, whose special ability is his use of personal pain as motivation to do great things) a disinclination to accept the responsibility that accompanies his/her great power, followed by the hero's eventual acceptance of the power and the additional responsibility that comes with the superpower. ""Chronicle's"" originality stems from the fact that the movie does not explore the conventional superhero origin story theme; and while I do not begrudge the conventional superhero origin story theme, it is the movie's diversion from the conventional superhero origin story theme that engendered my love for the film.""Chronicle"" chronicles the life of 3 high school seniors. Andrew Detmer, (played by Dane Dehann) is physically and emotionally abused by his alcoholic father and peers; Steve (played by Michael B. Jordan) is the charismatic and universally admired potential class president; Matt Garrety(played by Andrew Russell)is preternaturally nice and smart, but flawed in many ways as well. Matt's kind nature and sense of pity allows him to be Andrew's only companion.Andrew is relentlessly and mercilessly bullied. His morose personality attracts the attackers, but it is impossible not to feel sympathy for him.  As a means to create a distance between himself and other people, he enlists the use of a video camera; and he endeavors to use the camera to chronicle the circumstances of his life.  No one wants to be a part of Andrews experiment, and the bullying intensifies after the video camera is introduced. At a rave party, when Andrew's camera unintentionally lingers on an attractive woman, the woman's boyfriend expresses his displeasure by physically attacking Andrew before eventually spitting on him.After the assault at the party, Andrew heads outside, where he retreats to a solitary place amongst the trees.  As the party continues to rage in the background while Andrew hopelessly sobs, Steve saunters into the video camera's view.  Steve is able to cajole Andrew into following him through a grove of trees so that a recent discovery can be filmed.  When Steve and Andrew happen upon the discovery in a ravine, Matt Garrety is already stationed at a deep gulch in the ground. The three boys venture into the gulch, which eventually becomes an underground cave of some kind. After an undetermined amount of time exploring the cave, the three of them come upon some sort of alien life form.  The intrepid explorers make the mistake of venturing to close to the alien, and then the camera goes black.Cue to the scene where a healthy and happy Matt, Andrew, and Steve are cavalierly experimenting with their new powers in the back yard. All three boys have been endowed with the powers of telepathy; with Andrew becoming the most powerful of the three. The video camera is ever present, filming three boys goofing around with powers that could eventually change the world.  The three of them soon become bored with their backyard shenanigans, and decide to try some harmless experimentation on unsuspecting strangers in their town; that is until Andrew, who becomes annoyed at a honking truck driver, uses his power to run the truck off the road, critically injuring the truck driver. Andrew promises Matt and Steve that he will never again use his powers for ill, but it will be a promise that he will not be able to keep.Before his eventual breakdown, Andrew, with the help of Steve, is able to use his powers to become popular, if only for a little while.  His new found popularity gains Andrew and Matt access to an elite house party, and while at this party he becomes friendly with a red haired beauty of a woman. This is the night that Andrew is finally going to lose his virginity. Unfortunately for Andrew, he is not able to consummate the act. His failure in this endeavor accelerates his descent into madness.Andrew goes on to commit horrible acts of violence against his former tormenters; watching his horribly sick mother suffer from her debilitating disease incites criminal behavior; and the father who torments him as he convalesces in his hospital throws Andrew over the edge.  Andrew turns into a literal monster, terrorizing the city in which he lives with his powers until Matt has to put a stop to it all.No one stood out, but the performances of the principle cast were uniformly good.  All three of the principle actors skillfully inhabit the psyches of their characters. I was also impressed with the execution of the special effects, especially with the limited budget (15,000,000).  Moreover, the ""found film"" sensibility of the finished product adds to the specialness of the three boys.  While watching the movie, you'll feel like you've discovered something precious as well.

1464955,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B005LAIGPA,DanD,"[1, 1]","What if ordinary people acquired extraordinary powers?  It's a tired theme, to be sure, but it's never been given the found-footage treatment.  I know; it doesn't exactly sound like something that would work.  But thanks the deft hand of director Josh Tank, and a superb cast, CHRONICLE manages to pull it off admirably.The story isn't complex: three high schoolers (loner Andrew, popular Steve, partier Matt) stumble upon a strange glowing thing underground.  They come away from it with powers.  Things spiral out of control.  You can predict what happens; the focus here is upon how it's captured.  The story lends itself to breaking away from the typical ""one of the characters shoots the whole movie"" trope (in some creative, and some annoying, ways), and the special effects, though at first hokey, become more and more awe-inspiring.  The acting from the three leads (Dane DeHaan, Michael B. Jordon, and Alex Russell, respectively) is above-par; very naturalistic, very organic.  You can feel them bonding, having a typically teenage time discovering what all they can do.  This is where CHRONICLE is at its best: three friends learning about themselves and each other, set against some unnerving superpowers.The film becomes a bit more typical in its final act; at first, this is okay--it's not as fun as the third two-thirds, but it's impressively rendered.  Then it just sort of dissolves.  That's CHRONICLE'S biggest flaw--it ultimately succumbs to the conventions it has tried so hard to flaunt.  When it works, it's very impressive (and I'm skeptical of the whole ""shaky cam/found footage"" genre; in fact, this is the first one I've enjoyed in a long time).  But the film can't stand up to the pressures of conformity.

The film is part of the growing number of stories that deconstruct the superhero ideal -- in print, titles like ""Irredeemable,"" ""Marvelman"" and ""Invincible"" come to mind, while in filmland, this falls somewhere between the gratuitous gore of ""Kickass"" and flawed-hero origin stories such as ""Hancock"" or ""Unbreakable.""I thought the film was well done and intelligent - it's understandable that many Amazon users have given this bad ratings, since they probably aren't used to seeing low-budget films and expect everything to be high-tech and CGI-ed out. But for viewers who are willing to forgive special effects that are roughly equivalent to those of TV's ""Heroes"" series, this film offers a strong, unsettling script and three characters whose actions and reactions are completely believable. I, for one, wouldn't mind a sequel to see where the story goes from here. Not the greatest movie ever, but definitely worth a whirl.

Suddenly they can move objects with their minds, manipulate matter. . .even fly.

There is really little to like about the teens once we get to meet them, so when bad things begin to happen to them there's nothing to compel the viewer to care; yet what CHRONICLE lacks in story and content is cancelled out by stunning visual thrills.

As more than one character rightly observed, ""it's weird,"" and ""it's creepy.""  They also could have added that it isn't natural, logical, or possible to run around with a camera welded to your face.  Even worse, once they've taken the time and the trouble to set up a single viewpoint, supposedly linked to one camera, they then introduce multiple cameras not linked to the one source.  It's as though they figured out too late that they needed many vantage points in order to tell their story.  This brings up the question, why even bother introducing a camera?  It certainly didn't require such an obvious gimmick, especially considering the banality of their so-called chronicle.  Take away the superpower aspect and what you have is a run of the mill After School Special about the evils of bullying.  It also didn't help that the dynamic between the three lead characters was rather an obvious clich&eacute;.  This gave them absolutely nowhere to go but towards the predictable outcome.

1464978,AMMXFNJSKJUQ,B005LAIGPA,ElectricMelody,"[3, 5]","**Originally posted on ""#1 Hits From Another Planet"" - 2/8/12**With Chronicle, 2012 has its first great movie. It's easily the most exciting, watchable action/sci-fi film in months. What first-time director Josh Trank was able to accomplish on a shoe-string (at least by Hollywood standards) budget is so cool that it borders on unbelievable.The story will be familiar to most who have watched any superpower origin tale. More specifically, the script owes a great debt to pioneering 80's anime classic Akira. Three teenagers, one of them weaker, more socially awkward, and ultimately more disturbed, start to develop mysterious powers after an incident outside of a party. Andrew, the younger/weaker of the three (played by the pitch-perfect Dane DeHaan) finds he's able to control his newfound abilities to a greater and more impressive extent than the others. But, due to circumstances not entirely under his control, the powers prove to be too much for him. And thus, we have conflict.While the story's familiar, the execution is startlingly fresh. Sure, the ""found footage"" genre has been around for awhile, but until now, I'm not sure it's ever been exploited to its full potential. Viewing this incredible story through an everyday lens gives the film a naturalistic feel and makes the effects all that more shocking, real and... well... fun. And honestly, ""fun"" is what this movie's about. Not that it's super happy or anything, but it's certainly a jolt of guerrilla film-making. In a world of polished studio action movies, this feels more like a couple of (ridiculously creative) storytellers playing around. Of course, it helps that they've got a taut, wonderfully human story at the core. For as awesome and exciting as the set-pieces are, Chronicle doesn't take the easy way out. Its characters feel real and completely sympathetic. In other words, it's really got a bit of everything for everyone. And at just under 90 minutes, it doesn't overstay its welcome.

After touching and probing, the boys wind up with super-powers. At first, they had fun with harmless pranks, until their dark sides began to take over, then the laughter turned into danger. Their goofy fooling around was harmless at first, and that's where it should have ended. However, their superhuman activities became scary and destructive. The acting was excellent and the riveting story slowly became tense as danger began to lurk.

1464992,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B005LAIGPA,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[30, 45]","When friends have a falling out, it's best for all parties involved - including unwitting bystanders - that they don't have destructive superhuman abilities. Because the collateral damage off that spat is wicked crazy. CHRONICLE is one of them ""found footage"" films, the narrative unfolding pseudo-documentary-style mainly thru video cameras employed by the characters. Other recording devices - cell phone & traffic cameras and security feeds and tools brought to bear by breaking news media coverage - come into play later on in the tremendous third act.CHRONICLE centers around the strange thing what befalls three high school seniors: the popular and charismatic Steve (Michael B. Jordan); the smart and just a bit pretentious Matt (Alex Russell); and Andrew (Dane DeHaan), the weirdo loner burdened with the dying mom and abusive dad. It's Andrew who opts to escape his disturbing home life by throwing himself into his handycam hobby. As escapism he films everything in sight. He takes his video recorder everywhere. While attending a rave, Steve, Matt, and Andrew are diverted by a deep hole in the ground in the nearby woods. What they eventually stumble across somehow imbues them with super powers. Soon Steve, Matt, and Andrew are experimenting (read: goofing around) with telekinesis and learning how to fly (which is just another extension of telekinesis). Of course, there are the requisite nose bleeds.Andrew demonstrates a natural affinity for his newfound talents. They develop more quickly than do Matt's or Steve's. So at least he has that to feel good about. But there's a disconnect with the troubled Andrew. The family home melodrama exacerbates his sense of alienation. Still, their mutual powers draw the trio closer together. They begin to hang out a lot more.There's an organic flow to the story, or during the first two thirds anyway. The script allows the actors to sound off with believable dialogue. The three leads are natural in their roles; there's an authentic vibe. I like to think that the stuff they get up to initially, in exploring their powers, are stuff that normal teenagers would think up. Their antics in the supermarket are pretty hilarious, even though that was a mean thing they did, spooking the little girl. Me, I probably won't be able to help abusing my powers a little bit. Steve, Matt, and Andrew apply theirs to have fun and impress other kids (by, say, staging a magic show or showing off while playing the quarters beer game). Matt is the most level-headed of the bunch. He at least seems aware of the necessity of keeping their secret. He tries to lay down some ground rules, like not using their abilities on living things or using them when they're angry. It's worrying that the much bullied Andrew doesn't see the point of these rules.Most of the film's first half is so lighthearted and goofy that it's all the more impactful when things finally get serious. One of the three begins to subscribe to that old ""survival of the fittest"" way of thinking. He begins to regard himself as the ultimate predator and mere humans as disposable insects. The other two try to talk sense into him, but, by that stage, we're all just pretty much waiting for the inevitable downspiral into fighty fight.I happened to really like CLOVERFIELD, a recent ""found footage"" monster film (I know a lot of folks didn't). I think that CHRONICLE shares CLOVERFIELD'S sense of immediacy. Only, this time, you get a feel for what it may really be like to be caught on ground zero when ridiculously powerful metahumans furiously duke it out. One famous landmark in Seattle gets a shellacking.Did you think the film needed to delve more into the crystalline object in the underground cavern which (it's assumed) bestowed paranormal talents on them kids? I don't think so. I even liked that the story dropped it. The kids make an attempt to revisit the hole in the ground, but things don't pan out, and they shrug it off. And while the introduction of the girl who records with her own camera for her blog may be a convenient plot device, she does ground one of the characters. I like that there's a thru line to the story, that ***SPOILERS NOW FOR THE REST OF THE SENTENCE*** the superhumans are later exposed to the world. This raises the stakes tremendously. It encompasses the frenetic third act. There are some archetypal elements that come into play in this collision between an amoral monster and his friend still trying to talk him down. And it ultimately defines the makings of a hero. The special effects are pretty amazing considering the film's low budget. The flying sequences are breathlessly entertaining. And while I enjoyed the sense of humor and the cool superhero beats, these alone wouldn't have been enough. You required those solid chunks of storytelling and character development to prop them up.",5,Friends don't let friends use their powers for eeeeevil,1328918400,"02 11, 2012",2012,4849,"['When',

Such a phrase has guided Spider-Man throughout his career, but occasionally the thought comes up: what if he didn't follow this famous mantra, and instead used his powers for selfish reasons?  While ""Chronicle"" may not be related to Spider-man, it perfectly explores what would happen if the famous saying was ignored.""Chronicle"" follows three high school kids who have pretty ordinary lives: one is running for class president, one is the shy type whom nobody likes, and the last is the outgoing, energetic type.  One night, while at a rave, the three come across something mysterious, and find themselves in possession of powers that allow them to manipulate things with their minds.  As expected, they start off doing pranks (like using a leaf blower on skirts, for example), but as time goes on, being in possession of so much power can be dangerous...and even deadly.Even among the glut of superhero and found-footage films, ""Chronicle"" manages to stand out, in most-part, due to that it's not really a superhero film: rather, it's really a story about how absolute power corrupts absolutely.  While I was watching the movie, I was really surprised to find myself being more interested in the teens, rather then the powers they wield.  All three are best friends, and they're good at heart, but are not above using their powers to mess with people's heads.  Andrew, in particular, is one of the most interesting film teenagers I've seen in recent memory, due to his miserable home life, and how he reacts with his new-found abilities.  Yet, from the beginning, it's clear that the power is inevitably going to corrupt the teens, which leads to a extraordinarily powerful third act that that genuinely had me more interested in what Andrew and the others were going to do, and not in the action that was taking place around them.Even though there have arguably been too many superhero and found footage films over the past few years, ""Chronicle"" manages to feel fresh and exciting.  While it's faults are few (the CGI is at times a bit obvious), the strength of it's storytelling more then makes up for any flaws.  It's an unexpectedly gripping and thrilling film that focuses on the emotional consequences of how extraordinary powers corrupt ordinary people, rather then on spectacle and action, as other films would have done, and for that, I highly recommend it.",5,With great power comes great trouble,1328227200,"02 3, 2012",2012,2519,"['Perhaps', 'other', 'phrase', 'comic', 'book', 'genre', 'applies', 'daily', 'life', 'as', 'much', 'Spider-Man', 'famous', 'great', 'power', 'great', 'responsibility', 'Such', 'phrase', 'guided', 'Spider-Man', 'career', 'occasionally', 'thought', 'up', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'famous', 'mantra', 'instead', 'used', 'powers', 'selfish', 'reasons', 'Chronicle', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'related', 'Spider-man', 'perfectly', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'famous', 'saying', 'was', 'ignored', 'Chronicle', 'three', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'who', 'have', 'pretty', 'ordinary', 'lives', 'one', 'running', 'class', 'president', 'one', 'shy', 'type', 'whom', 'nobody', 'last', 'outgoing', 'energetic', 'type', 'One', 'night', 'rave', 'three', 'come', 'something', 'mysterious', 'find', 'possession', 'powers', 'allow', 'manipulate', 'things', 'minds', 'expected', 'start', 'doing', 'pranks', 'using', 'leaf', 'blower', 'skirts', 'example', 'time', 'being', 'possession', 'so', 'much', 'power', 'can', 'be', 'dangerous', 'even', 'deadly.Even', 'glut', 'superhero', 'found-footage', 'films', 'Chronicle', 'stand', 'out', 'most-part', 'due', 'not', 'really', 'superhero', 'film', 'rather', 'really', 'story', 'how', 'absolute', 'power', 'corrupts', 'absolutely', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'find', 'being', 'more', 'interested', 'teens', 'rather', 'then', 'powers', 'wield', 'three', 'are', 'best', 'friends', ""'re"", 'good', 'heart', 'are', 'not', 'using', 'powers', 'mess', 'people', 'heads', 'Andrew', 'particular', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'film', 'teenagers', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'memory', 'due', 'miserable', 'home', 'life', 'how', 'new-found', 'abilities', 'beginning', 'clear', 'power', 'inevitably', 'going', 'corrupt', 'teens', 'extraordinarily', 'powerful', 'third', 'act', 'genuinely', 'had', 'more', 'interested', 'what', 'Andrew', 'others', 'were', 'going', 'do', 'not', 'action', 'was', 'taking', 'place', 'around', 'them.Even', 'there', 'have', 'arguably', 'been', 'too', 'many', 'superhero', 'found', 'footage', 'films', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'Chronicle', 'feel', 'fresh', 'exciting', 'faults', 'are', 'few', 'CGI', 'times', 'bit', 'obvious', 'strength', 'storytelling', 'more', 'then', 'up', 'flaws', 'unexpectedly', 'gripping', 'thrilling', 'film', 'emotional', 'consequences', 'how', 'extraordinary', 'powers', 'corrupt', 'ordinary', 'people', 'rather', 'then', 'spectacle', 'action', 'other', 'films', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'highly', 'recommend']",Chronicle

1464996,A1Y0HX12MCT6OR,B005LAIGPA,I'm Right,"[1, 2]","Chronicle has your average young superhero movie origin formula, however they play it off with much better effect. The story revolves around three highschool kids that find this meteor or something underground and it bestows them with telekenesis. Two of the kids want to keep it as a little hobby they do with each other while one of them, after going through years of abuse, wants to use his powers for his own purposes.Chronicle's age old story was told really well, where the villian Andrew here is really fleshed out well as a sympathetic character, making his downfall that more tragic. RedLetterMedia pointed out that this whole story is essentially the same as the Star Wars prequels and yet it tells the story with much more conviction and excitment in less than 90 minutes, suck on that Lucas indeed. Alex (I think?) is Andrew's more popular cousin who tries to help Andrew out with his social situation, and Steve is the charismatic school president who happens to be with them when they discover the rock, all of them seemed stereotypical but it was the little flourishes here and there that made their characters more convicing than they should've been.The only real complaint I have though about Chronicle (and everyone else has covered it there and back again) is the found-footage style, it didn't really seem necessary to tell the story and it wasn't consistent. The first scene Andrew explains to his drunk dad that he bought a camera and is recording his dad being locked in his room, so what's he going to do with the camera, send it to the police? No, he's going to carry it around with him everywhere, recording everything. Why? Is he so lonely that he films himself? I've never heard of people doing that before. Also Alex's love interest happened to be a blog personality online that also happens to film everything, very coincidential for a movie that plays itself out for realism. Then near the end there's a few camera shots like when Alex opens his eyes after laying down with the police around him, there was no camera filming that, so they didn't even keep the 'found footage' style consistent.What they should've done instead was pick and choose what to film 'found footage' like and what not to, like when Andrew pushes the car into the river there's no reason he would've grabbed the camera in real life, so scenes like that just film them naturally, it's not a big deal if it's not all completely found footage. Some parts were interestingly shot too, like the final 'confrontation' was all shot through onlooker's cell phones or cameras, it was definately innovative and looked realistic, but I wanted a little more. So again, cut to some people's camera persepctive then cut back to the action, well I don't know, it was still damn good and I'm rambling again.Anyways Chronicle was entertaining the entire way through which is a gem of it's own, not one second I would say was filler. All the 'hataz' that say it was dumb teenage angst crap it's not, teen agnst is kids with first world problems brooding about getting grounded or something, Andrew had real problems and issues. And for the people saying it was slow: seriously? Anyways for normal people tired of seeing the same Superhero origin crap being vomited out into movie theaters everywhere Chronicle takes that concept and puts a new spin on it making it interesting again, definately worth a look.",4,A Chronic Good Time,1340409600,"06 23, 2012",2012,3395,"['Chronicle', 'average', 'young', 'superhero', 'movie', 'origin', 'formula', 'however', 'play', 'off', 'much', 'better', 'effect', 'story', 'around', 'three', 'highschool', 'kids', 'find', 'meteor', 'something', 'underground', 'telekenesis', 'Two', 'kids', 'want', 'keep', 'little', 'hobby', 'do', 'other', 'one', 'going', 'years', 'abuse', 'use', 'powers', 'own', 'purposes.Chronicle', 'age', 'old', 'story', 'was', 'told', 'really', 'well', 'where', 'villian', 'Andrew', 'here', 'really', 'fleshed', 'out', 'well', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'making', 'downfall', 'more', 'tragic', 'RedLetterMedia', 'pointed', 'out', 'whole', 'story', 'essentially', 'same', 'Star', 'Wars', 'prequels', 'yet', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'conviction', 'excitment', 'less', '90', 'minutes', 'suck', 'Lucas', 'indeed', 'Alex', 'think', 'Andrew', 'more', 'popular', 'cousin', 'who', 'help', 'Andrew', 'out', 'social', 'situation', 'Steve', 'charismatic', 'school', 'president', 'who', 'be', 'when', 'discover', 'rock', 'seemed', 'stereotypical', 'was', 'little', 'flourishes', 'here', 'there', 'made', 'characters', 'more', 'convicing', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been.The', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'have', 'though', 'Chronicle', 'everyone', 'else', 'covered', 'back', 'again', 'found-footage', 'style', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'necessary', 'tell', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'consistent', 'first', 'scene', 'Andrew', 'drunk', 'dad', 'bought', 'camera', 'recording', 'dad', 'being', 'locked', 'room', 'what', 'going', 'do', 'camera', 'send', 'police', 'No', 'going', 'carry', 'around', 'everywhere', 'recording', 'everything', 'Why', 'so', 'lonely', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'people', 'doing', 'Also', 'Alex', 'love', 'interest', 'happened', 'be', 'blog', 'personality', 'online', 'also', 'film', 'everything', 'very', 'coincidential', 'movie', 'out', 'realism', 'Then', 'end', 'few', 'camera', 'shots', 'when', 'Alex', 'eyes', 'laying', 'down', 'police', 'was', 'camera', 'filming', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'keep', ""'found"", 'footage', 'style', 'should', ""'ve"", 'done', 'instead', 'was', 'pick', 'choose', 'what', 'film', 'footage', 'what', 'not', 'when', 'Andrew', 'car', 'river', 'reason', 'would', ""'ve"", 'grabbed', 'camera', 'real', 'life', 'so', 'scenes', 'just', 'film', 'naturally', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'not', 'completely', 'found', 'footage', 'parts', 'were', 'interestingly', 'shot', 'too', 'final', ""'confrontation"", 'was', 'shot', 'onlooker', 'cell', 'phones', 'cameras', 'was', 'definately', 'innovative', 'looked', 'realistic', 'wanted', 'little', 'more', 'So', 'again', 'cut', 'people', 'camera', 'persepctive', 'then', 'cut', 'back', 'action', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'still', 'damn', 'good', ""'m"", 'rambling', 'again.Anyways', 'Chronicle', 'was', 'entertaining', 'entire', 'way', 'gem', 'own', 'not', 'one', 'second', 'would', 'say', 'was', 'filler', ""'hataz"", 'say', 'was', 'dumb', 'teenage', 'angst', 'crap', 'not', 'teen', 'agnst', 'kids', 'first', 'world', 'problems', 'brooding', 'getting', 'grounded', 'something', 'Andrew', 'had', 'real', 'problems', 'issues', 'people', 'saying', 'was', 'slow', 'seriously', 'Anyways', 'normal', 'people', 'tired', 'seeing', 'same', 'Superhero', 'origin', 'crap', 'being', 'vomited', 'out', 'movie', 'theaters', 'everywhere', 'Chronicle', 'concept', 'new', 'spin', 'making', 'interesting', 'again', 'definately', 'look']",Chronicle

I was hoping the film would explore subjects like how people with superpowers would deal with it, but that was wishful thinking. The story needed to be much deeper than this. Where is the US government? Other governments? One of the characters does turn evil, but the way it's done is quite poor. He was bullied, gets a mean scowl on his face and starts destroying buildings. That's it?This is not a movie for people who have been in the working world for a few years. It's great for teenagers, but it's a ridiculous movie that gets really pretentious and silly at the very end. It's a movie written from the perspective of a person that grew up in a well-off area, living a shallow party lifestyle, and it's fairly obvious.

I didn't realize it was another installment in what is becoming the ""found footage"" genre. We start off with another high school student wanting to document every second of his day to day routine. The filmmakers find creative ways to keep the ""documenting"" process going to see all angles and all activities. Fortunately, the jittery ""hand held"" camera feel disappears and you find three high school students with super powers. By chance they discover what might be an alien life force undergrown that gives them incredible power.There are some super fantastic scenes of the kids flying high in the sky as they realize the extent of their powers. Along with incredible powers comes the urge to abuse the powers. A first the tricks are annoying but harmless, ""move"" a shopper's car to completely different parking space all though the power of telekinesis. Needless to say, silly tricks soon have the potential for serious harm.There is a moral story here of how one would or should use super powers for good or evil. Our three heroes have the potential for good and evil, especially outcast Andrew, who quickly begins to relish in his power. Andrew has a dying mother and a violently abusive father. There is no surprise that his new found skills could turn into an abuse of power.Now the story follows along until death and mayhem enter the picture. Suddenly, the film loses direction and turns into mayhem and destruction of the city of Seattle.

The dialog is pretty risable and you can watch the first 30 minutes with the sound off and still know exactly what's happening.The three teenagers are: a misunderstood emo-type with a bad home life, a philosophical type who quotes texts, and a popular jock (also the token black guy and yes, he does get killed first). They're like, totally, you know like whoa in their dialog except for like the philosophical stuff that grates as badly as Rick Santorum at a Lady Gaga concert.Unfortunately, they opt for the ""found footage"" film model which almost never works even in the hands of people such as J J Abrams. This filming gimmick gets in the way of the story since every scene has to invent a reason why somebody is filming it. As a classic revenge-slash-superhero gone bad set-up, the use of ""found footage"" is Kryptonite to letting the plot and characters develop.On the plus side, the special effects are really excellent for a $12mm movie (filmed in South Africa, interestingly enough) - there are more visuals in the last 30 minutes than in most $200mm summer blockbusters. The best sequence is reminiscent of the Universal Orlando ride ""The Amazing Adventures of Spiderman"" and is really gripping to watch and easily the strongest part of the film. It's also the one area where the point-of-view shots work very well.Dane DeHaan is the best actor in the group as he slowly descends in craziness. Unfortunately he doesn't have much to work with since the film's dialog eventually becomes ""I'm stronger than you!"", ""Don't make stop you!"" and lines that you wouldn't see in speech bubbles in any respectable comic.This is a strong concept with great visuals but the generic characters and thin dialog ultimately let it down.",3,A slow starter with great visuals and weak dialog,1338595200,"06 2, 2012",2012,1979,"['film', 'while', 'get', 'started', 'unfortunately', 'first', '40', 'minutes', 'so', 'are', 'largely', 'comprised', 'setting', 'up', 'generic', 'high', 'school', 'characters', 'watching', 'behave', 'way', 'screenwriters', '30s', 'think', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'behave', 'dialog', 'pretty', 'risable', 'can', 'watch', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'sound', 'still', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'happening.The', 'three', 'teenagers', 'are', 'misunderstood', 'emo-type', 'bad', 'home', 'life', 'philosophical', 'type', 'who', 'texts', 'popular', 'jock', 'also', 'token', 'black', 'guy', 'yes', 'get', 'killed', 'first', ""'re"", 'totally', 'know', 'whoa', 'dialog', 'philosophical', 'stuff', 'as', 'badly', 'Rick', 'Santorum', 'Lady', 'Gaga', 'concert.Unfortunately', 'opt', 'found', 'footage', 'film', 'model', 'almost', 'never', 'even', 'hands', 'people', 'such', 'J', 'J', 'Abrams', 'filming', 'gimmick', 'way', 'story', 'scene', 'invent', 'reason', 'why', 'somebody', 'filming', 'classic', 'revenge-slash-superhero', 'gone', 'bad', 'set-up', 'use', 'found', 'footage', 'Kryptonite', 'letting', 'plot', 'characters', 'develop.On', 'plus', 'side', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'really', 'excellent', '12mm', 'movie', 'filmed', 'South', 'Africa', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'are', 'more', 'visuals', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'most', '200mm', 'summer', 'blockbusters', 'best', 'sequence', 'reminiscent', 'Universal', 'Orlando', 'ride', 'Amazing', 'Adventures', 'Spiderman', 'really', 'gripping', 'watch', 'easily', 'strongest', 'part', 'film', 'also', 'one', 'area', 'where', 'point-of-view', 'shots', 'work', 'very', 'well.Dane', 'DeHaan', 'best', 'actor', 'group', 'slowly', 'craziness', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'work', 'film', 'dialog', 'eventually', ""'m"", 'stronger', 'Do', ""n't"", 'make', 'stop', 'lines', 'would', ""n't"", 'see', 'speech', 'bubbles', 'respectable', 'comic.This', 'strong', 'concept', 'great', 'visuals', 'generic', 'characters', 'thin', 'dialog', 'ultimately', 'let', 'down']",Chronicle

This piqued my curiosity. I wondered why so many people were really enjoying this film. I finally got around to seeing it this past weekend, and I can say wholeheartedly that this is an excellent film that is more in the vein of the great ""found footage"" film genre, like CLOVERFIELD, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, and THE LAST EXORCISM rather than the lackluster attempts such as QUARANTINE, the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY franchise and most of the associated horror films it spawned.The way that I see the film is as a great entry into the superhero genre, relating to characters like Spider-Man and The X-Men. What if three high-school boys got superpowers, but didn't have the moral compass of a character like Professor X or Uncle Ben?The film is the brainchild of director Josh Trank and his co-writer Max Landis (son of the once-great John Landis), and it embraces the tropes of superhero cinema and the ""found footage"" conceit and it turns both ideas on their heads. While most of the film is shot from one point of view, as their telekinetic powers grow, they're able to move the camera to unnatural POV shots rather than just keeping it static. And especially the third act of the film begins to use several different cameras, such as camera phones, security cameras, ATM cameras and police surveillance cameras splicing them all together to get a greater perspective and sense of cinematic urgency that films of this type generally lack. The special effects of the film are crucial and very rarely do they not feel seamless. Trank also gives the control of the in-film camera to the most important character rather than let it change hands terribly often or give it to a secondary character. This allows us to watch the evolution of the character's arc and give it a more organic feel.The film also features powerful performances by Dane DeHaan as the increasingly isolated and troubled Andrew and Alex Russell as his conflicted cousin Matt. The only issue that I have with the film, and it's a pretty minor quibble, is that the dialogue sometimes doesn't feel natural, and I think that's more of an issue of restraint rather than the actors playing it badly or the writing being poor.When all is said and done, the film is very clever, very well-paced (it's very brief, running at around 80 minutes), and very well-acted. It puts a very refreshing spin on a genre we're becoming maybe a little too familiar with and helps breathe new life into it.

What surprised and thrilled me about this movie (that has now bumpedJoy Rideout of my ""favorite movie"" spot) is:1. The acting. Totally believable high school dudes with distinct personalities. And Andrew's background sets the stage for what happens when a marginalized, bullied and abused kid finally gets the power to fight back.2. Special effects. For me, special effects have to SUPPORT a story for me to like it...not just be there to try to wow the crowd. I have no idea how they filmed the amazing flying stuff, but it was just...CRAZY. Crazy good. There were times--I kid you not--when I became aware that my mouth was hanging open.3. Intense plot that escalates. Just when you think it can't get worse...it does. I reached out for my husband's hand more than once...and squeezed the living daylights out of it. My heart still feels like it's trying to calm down from the experience (and it's been about 20 minutes since it was over!)4. The ending. It rocked. Totally satisfying.Like Joyride, there's some funny parts...at first (especially when they're in the toy store messing around with their new-found ""gifts""). There's some emotional roller-coaster stuff going on as well, with Andrew's home life. So combining the emotional range of this film with the special effects, acting and satisfying ending...Wait.

1465008,A1EA7VXIUZBYIK,B005LAIGPA,"Jason Brown ""Dark-edged Apologist""","[0, 1]","It's a good thing I rented it. This felt more like a visual allegory of regular teens trying to understand the changes still happening to them throughout teenhood. Especially when it comes to abuse and how one can have revenge fantasies.This deals with a severely bullied teen, his cousin, and his cousin's friend, who befriends him, and what they discover about theirselves after discovering a very strange object underground after a party. The object doesn't get explained, but what's the need? The hints and implications are enough, and so are the powers that come from it. And what the guys do with said powers is at first outrageous. Pulling psychic pranks on people (like floating a teddy bear in front of a little girl, moving a woman's car without touching it, and turning on a leafblower to lift the skirts of a few girls). Then it gets to bigger stuff until an accident happens that questions their abilities and if they can use them for real or if they'll be having problems. What the bullied kid has is major issues stemming from how others see him as a total freak because he loves using his camera. People think he's spying on them, bash his camera (and him, not to mention spit on him), his alcohol father berates him just for locking his door so he won't come in and beat im up, and he seems most comfortable when he's completely alone.Then their powers develop further with more use, and they try them out, almost harmlessly enough, yet things still go buck wild, especially with a teen-created superstorm (is that ever a good idea to do when it comes to a sharply bullied teenager? I doubt it). Then it gets to be more tragic. More troublesome, to the point of a city-wide showdown between cousin and cousin. What happens almost caused me to shed a tear. Almost. What did it was what happens afterward, something hinted at earlier in the film that hints at further sadness.

1465009,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B005LAIGPA,Jason,"[3, 5]","The Chronicle creators (writer Max Landis, Director Josh Trank) have cleverly melded three common plot devices used individually for multiple other films: finding a mysterious object that affects characters (Green Lantern, etc.), the achievement of super powers through circumstance (Fantastic Four, etc.), and telekinesis (Zapped, Firestarter, Carrie, Phenomenon, Push, etc.).In this hodge-podge, three unlikely friends - Andrew (DeHaan), Matt (Russell), Steve (Jordan) - find themselves with amazing powers, abilities that at first are used for fun and pranks but later turn to darker purposes.  Thought of as a muscle to be strengthened, the powers develop as the trio experiment more and more.  They soon find out, however, that excessive or strenuous use causes nosebleeds.  What's more, they learn the powers are dangerous when the fun and games end.Filmed primarily through a hand-held camera, Chronicle manages to embrace newer techniques and fresh perspective without causing epileptic seizures (looking at you, Cloverfield).  Driven by Andrew's desire to document everything he's experiencing in life, in high school, at home with his drunken father, the hand-held camera holds purpose but is somewhat superfluous.  Especially since later scenes exploit the superpower angle to use the handheld camera at lengths far enough away to fully grasp scenes with action.  Very rarely do I truly enjoy this style of filmmaking, but the usage is sparse enough and unique enough to transcend inherent flaws.Despite the recycled troubled teenagers angle and tired lessons about the dangers of power, the script is crisp.  Dialogue is witty, engaging, and realistic.  Like teens of today talk.  Not at all a forced hip, unrealistic, inauthentic, or self righteous like everything Diablo Cody writes.  Each member of the young cast shows talent, making the most of their lines at least enough to convince viewers of their status on the High School food chain.Overall the effort is exciting and enticing, enough to draw in viewers emotionally while still providing enough FX action to terrorize the Seattle landscape with familiar yet fresh mutant vs. mortal X-Men themes.

Either way, it really helped take away the tacky parts that usually comes with documentary films.

The dark part of the film is Andrew's life, which is filled with abuse from school bullies and even his father; all of the abuse is presented vividly. Don't get me wrong, the film has some exhilaratingly fun scenes like when they're  flying and narrowly escape death or when they're playing around with their powers in public. I personally thought the film's ending was epic and wonderfully shot. The pacing was also very fast in my opinion.

It seems his life is quite hopeless and dreary until he and his two friends discover a cave, go exploring in it and find some strange glowing rock formation that knocks them all and the camera out.Once the camera is back on they appear to be fine but its quickly obvious they each have some kind of super power thanks to said glowing rocks. At first its just moving objects with their minds and having fun but if it stopped at that it would be a boring movie. As expected they start to want to do more with their new found gifts, namely Andrew who develops a taste for using it for the wrong reasons.Since this is all filmed from Andrew's camera it tries to lend a sense of realism much like ""Cloverfield"" attempted to with the monster movie genre. ""Chronicle"" does have some impressive visuals, decent story that feels a little real life and some good acting as it really just focuses on the main 3 friends with other actors only making occasional appearances.

It's annoying to watch, especially, with the quick-cut editing.One of the major problems is that found-footage films barely have well-developed characters and tell awkward, rushed plots. The structure is definitely, not normal film structure.The first half of the film, while showing some nice special effects, is a total bore and a mess. Too many shots and short scenes of the teens playing around with their powers, for example.It's not until the second-half of the film, that the viewer is finally given a ""plot"" and a developed character (although, not well-rounded), in the form of a cliched protagonist-turned-antagonist. However, this was certainly, the best part of the film, including the rather action-packed 10 min ending.The film had potential to be something original and fresh, but the found-footage aspect is what ruins the experience, as well as the lack of a compelling story.It wouldve been interesting if the hole in the ground and it's origins were explored more, as well as developing the antagonist plot, much earlier.Another problem is that all the characters seem to be capable of having the same powers and of course, one of them takes their power to the extreme and become the villian of three. The fact they all share the same powers, means there's no chance to create characters with distinctive superpowers (this is no ""Fantastic Three"").For comicbook fans and sci-fi films, ""Chronicle"" is a film with ideas that barely add-up to anything great. Some good action\special effects sequences, overshadowed by the lack of a compelling story and interesting characters.If the filmmakers ditched the found-footage concept and put more effort into the script\story, ""Chronicle"" couldve been something new in a sea of established comicbook films.",2,"""Found-footage"" aspect  is part of the film's kryptonite.",1337472000,"05 20, 2012",2012,1967,"['Chronicle', 'frustrating', 'film', 'review.I', 'know', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'trying', 'something', 'new', 'comic\\superhero', 'film', 'genre', 'found-footage\\hand-held', 'camera', 'work', 'actually', 'film', 'annoying', 'watch', 'especially', 'quick-cut', 'editing.One', 'major', 'problems', 'found-footage', 'films', 'barely', 'have', 'well-developed', 'characters', 'tell', 'awkward', 'rushed', 'plots', 'structure', 'definitely', 'not', 'normal', 'film', 'structure.The', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'showing', 'nice', 'special', 'effects', 'total', 'bore', 'mess', 'Too', 'many', 'shots', 'short', 'scenes', 'teens', 'playing', 'powers', 'example.It', 'not', 'second-half', 'film', 'viewer', 'finally', 'given', 'plot', 'developed', 'character', 'not', 'well-rounded', 'form', 'cliched', 'protagonist-turned-antagonist', 'However', 'was', 'certainly', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'including', 'rather', 'action-packed', '10', 'min', 'ending.The', 'film', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'something', 'original', 'fresh', 'found-footage', 'aspect', 'what', 'experience', 'as', 'well', 'lack', 'compelling', 'story.It', 'wouldve', 'been', 'interesting', 'hole', 'ground', 'origins', 'were', 'explored', 'more', 'as', 'well', 'developing', 'antagonist', 'plot', 'much', 'earlier.Another', 'problem', 'characters', 'seem', 'be', 'capable', 'having', 'same', 'powers', 'course', 'one', 'power', 'extreme', 'become', 'villian', 'three', 'fact', 'share', 'same', 'powers', 'chance', 'create', 'characters', 'distinctive', 'superpowers', 'Fantastic', 'Three', '.For', 'comicbook', 'fans', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'Chronicle', 'film', 'ideas', 'barely', 'add-up', 'anything', 'great', 'good', 'action\\special', 'effects', 'sequences', 'overshadowed', 'lack', 'compelling', 'story', 'interesting', 'characters.If', 'filmmakers', 'ditched', 'found-footage', 'concept', 'put', 'more', 'effort', 'script\\story', 'Chronicle', 'couldve', 'been', 'something', 'new', 'sea', 'established', 'comicbook', 'films']",Chronicle

Sadly, the drecks are too numerous to count. This flick falls somewhere in between.Appreciated the writers excluding the logic of the situation. There isn't anything that could resemble a plausible explanation, so, like 'Carrie', the story is all that matters.Tells the tale of three friends who are transformed by a mysterious crystal. Having been changed, they begin to realize that they have extraordinary comic book-like superpowers. Psychokinesis that begins with the minor ability to move small objects quickly escalating to near mystical feats of prowess, culminating in the ability to fly.Matt - the athlete, Steve - the popular student, and Andrew - the outcast.As they accept their new reality, the trio begin to explore their powers with exuberance, laughter, and light-hearted hijinks you expect of teenagers - lifting a girl's dress and the like. However, a close call where an innocent nearly dies has Matt and Steve making ""a rule"" that they have to accept responsibility for their actions; echoing theStan Leerefrain that with great power comes great responsibility.But outsider Andrew quietly defies the group agreement, he doesn't feel the need to contain and hide. In fact, he's of the mindset that they should personally benefit from their awesome gifts. Beginning with his abusive father - by breaking every bone in his body. The abused kid begins to emotionally and psychologically detach from any moral restraint. Having spent his entire life being the object of humiliation and torment - the effects of having such incredible power begins to take a toll on his sense of morality and even his sanity. And having two popular kids giving him defined boundaries isn't what he wants to hear. Soon, he begins to believe himself beyond his own humanity, a god amongst ants.Enjoyable exploration of the common theme in comic books: What would you do if you *really* had superpowers?A well-worn retreadthat's made enjoyable due to the decent-to-excellent sfx and believable acting by the three co-stars.

No names are mentioned, but astute readers won't find it hard to figure out who I'm talking about. Normally I avoid writing spoilers as much as I can, but I have found that, no matter how I phrase this review, it's still pretty obvious. I believe that is due less to my failings as a writer, and more to the failings of the movie's script. Even this website's staff review pretty much gives it away. Still, for those of you who are devout haters of spoilers, STOP READING NOW.------------------------------------------------------------------------------CHRONICLE is one of those films that is annoyingly close to being really, really good. The story concerns three high school seniors -- Andrew, Matt, and Steve. Andrew's mother is dying of lung cancer and his father is an abusive alcoholic. Andrew himself is your typical put-upon loser, the kind of skinny, whiny-voiced kid who seems to have forgotten to go through puberty. Although his family circumstances obviously make him a sympathetic character, it is not hard to see why he is so relentlessly bullied and teased at school. He's mopey, cowardly, isolated, and he carries a freaking camera around with him wherever he goes. Even to a rave.Then, lo and behold, the boys stumble across a strange hole in the ground, inside of which is some kind of mysterious glowing force that emits sounds like feedback from a speaker the size of a bus. The boys investigate (natch) and then, whatdoyaknow, they find that they have developed super powers from the strange object (which conveniently disappears for the rest of the film).The remainder of the story deals with the guys coming to terms with their new abilities (they don't seem particularly fazed by it) and learning how to use them. From here on out, the movie -- desperate for a villain -- takes the story down very predictable avenues. It turns out that having too much power can corrupt you (I'm surprised no one's ever realized this before), and before long, it's a battle royale to determine who will be the top dog of their little triumvirate.The special effects are fantastic. They are nearly seamless, which helps detract from the fact that this is a ""found footage"" movie. These types of movies use the ""found footage"" conceit to enhance the realism of the film, but in a case like this, it mostly just detracts from the story. What does it say about a movie that it is much easier to believe that a character can fly or move things with his mind than it is to believe that he carries a running camera with him every single solitary place he goes? Even up in the clouds, at night, during a thunderstorm, while he cries alone because he puked beer on a girl that wanted to sleep with him. He even carries it to a funeral, for heaven's sake.Near the end, when the film shifts back and forth between security cameras, news footage, and phone cameras, the ""found footage"" aspect becomes, ironically, less intrusive. At least, it seems more plausible. However, by then, the movie has devolved into a standard superhero showdown. Throughout the film, there are multiple references to philosophers and their beliefs on human nature, desire, or reality. It leads viewers to believe that there might be some kind of deeper theory driving the story, that there might be an allegory here for something grander and more interesting than teenagers playing football in the stratosphere. But, no. It seems as if the whole thing is basically about how much it sucks to be bullied by classmates and drunk dads.Even that wouldn't be so bad if the movie didn't foolishly conclude with a complete logical back-flip. The movie's message -- perhaps muddied by its need for a clear-cut antagonist and conflict -- is literally told to the audience by a character who reminds us that, while the villain killed many people and endangered the lives of countless others in a blind fit of petulant rage, he was still basically a good guy at heart.Wrong, movie. You can't have it both ways, at least not with a story that lacks as much meat as this one. Because the characters are so one-dimensional, the movie only works on a chewy, eye-candy level, but it desperately wants to make a watered-down point about Nature vs. Nurture, or perhaps the psychology of prepubescence. Either way, it comes across as half-baked, heavy-handed, and actually pretty ridiculous. And that's saying a lot for a film where teens use superpowers to scare little girls at toy stores.Watch it for the special effects, but be prepared to be steadily annoyed by Andrew's nails-on-a-chalkboard voice and the rather quick-and-easy slide the movie takes from ""Gee, these powers are awesome"" to ""The world must burn!""",3,Super Whiner,1336348800,"05 7, 2012",2012,4712,"['review', 'MILD', 'spoilers', 'names', 'are', 'mentioned', 'astute', 'readers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'who', ""'m"", 'talking', 'Normally', 'avoid', 'writing', 'spoilers', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'have', 'found', 'matter', 'how', 'phrase', 'review', 'still', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'believe', 'due', 'less', 'failings', 'writer', 'more', 'failings', 'movie', 'script', 'Even', 'website', 'staff', 'review', 'pretty', 'much', 'away', 'Still', 'who', 'are', 'haters', 'spoilers', 'STOP', 'READING', 'NOW.', 'CHRONICLE', 'one', 'films', 'annoyingly', 'close', 'being', 'really', 'really', 'good', 'story', 'concerns', 'three', 'high', 'school', 'seniors', 'Andrew', 'Matt', 'Steve', 'Andrew', 'mother', 'dying', 'lung', 'cancer', 'father', 'abusive', 'alcoholic', 'Andrew', 'typical', 'put-upon', 'loser', 'kind', 'skinny', 'whiny-voiced', 'kid', 'who', 'have', 'forgotten', 'go', 'puberty', 'family', 'circumstances', 'obviously', 'make', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'so', 'relentlessly', 'bullied', 'teased', 'school', 'mopey', 'cowardly', 'isolated', 'freaking', 'camera', 'wherever', 'Even', 'rave.Then', 'lo', 'behold', 'boys', 'stumble', 'strange', 'hole', 'ground', 'kind', 'mysterious', 'glowing', 'force', 'sounds', 'feedback', 'speaker', 'size', 'bus', 'boys', 'investigate', 'natch', 'then', 'whatdoyaknow', 'find', 'have', 'developed', 'super', 'powers', 'strange', 'object', 'conveniently', 'rest', 'film', 'remainder', 'story', 'deals', 'guys', 'coming', 'terms', 'new', 'abilities', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'particularly', 'fazed', 'learning', 'how', 'use', 'here', 'out', 'movie', 'desperate', 'villain', 'story', 'down', 'very', 'predictable', 'avenues', 'out', 'having', 'too', 'much', 'power', 'can', 'corrupt', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'one', 'ever', 'realized', 'before', 'long', 'battle', 'royale', 'determine', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'top', 'dog', 'little', 'triumvirate.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'fantastic', 'are', 'nearly', 'seamless', 'detract', 'fact', 'found', 'footage', 'movie', 'types', 'movies', 'use', 'found', 'footage', 'conceit', 'enhance', 'realism', 'film', 'case', 'mostly', 'just', 'detracts', 'story', 'What', 'say', 'movie', 'much', 'easier', 'believe', 'character', 'can', 'fly', 'move', 'things', 'mind', 'believe', 'running', 'camera', 'single', 'solitary', 'place', 'Even', 'up', 'clouds', 'night', 'thunderstorm', 'alone', 'puked', 'beer', 'girl', 'wanted', 'sleep', 'even', 'funeral', 'heaven', 'sake.Near', 'end', 'when', 'film', 'shifts', 'back', 'forth', 'security', 'cameras', 'news', 'footage', 'phone', 'cameras', 'found', 'footage', 'aspect', 'ironically', 'less', 'intrusive', 'least', 'more', 'plausible', 'However', 'then', 'movie', 'devolved', 'standard', 'superhero', 'showdown', 'film', 'are', 'multiple', 'references', 'philosophers', 'beliefs', 'human', 'nature', 'desire', 'reality', 'viewers', 'believe', 'might', 'be', 'kind', 'deeper', 'theory', 'driving', 'story', 'might', 'be', 'allegory', 'here', 'something', 'grander', 'more', 'interesting', 'teenagers', 'playing', 'football', 'stratosphere', 'whole', 'thing', 'basically', 'how', 'much', 'be', 'bullied', 'classmates', 'drunk', 'dads.Even', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'foolishly', 'conclude', 'complete', 'logical', 'back-flip', 'movie', 'message', 'perhaps', 'muddied', 'need', 'clear-cut', 'antagonist', 'conflict', 'literally', 'told', 'audience', 'character', 'who', 'villain', 'killed', 'many', 'people', 'endangered', 'lives', 'countless', 'others', 'blind', 'fit', 'petulant', 'rage', 'was', 'still', 'basically', 'good', 'guy', 'heart.Wrong', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'ways', 'least', 'not', 'story', 'as', 'much', 'meat', 'one', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'one-dimensional', 'movie', 'only', 'chewy', 'eye-candy', 'level', 'desperately', 'make', 'watered-down', 'point', 'Nature', 'vs.', 'Nurture', 'perhaps', 'psychology', 'prepubescence', 'way', 'half-baked', 'heavy-handed', 'actually', 'pretty', 'ridiculous', 'saying', 'lot', 'film', 'where', 'teens', 'use', 'superpowers', 'scare', 'little', 'girls', 'toy', 'stores.Watch', 'special', 'effects', 'be', 'prepared', 'be', 'steadily', 'annoyed', 'Andrew', 'nails-on-a-chalkboard', 'voice', 'rather', 'quick-and-easy', 'slide', 'movie', 'Gee', 'powers', 'are', 'awesome', 'world', 'must', 'burn']",Chronicle

On another level, it's a surprisingly good action film--one that doesn't leave you groaning when the action unfolds and things break down.This is due in large part to a surprisingly well-written script that includes all the expected telekinesis cliches (""Did you do that?"" Look! I can move it, I can move it!"") and adds things to the managerie, as their growing power reveals a growing darkness in one of the characters, leading to a finale that by itself is worth the price of admission.Using an unsteady camcorder and footage from other cameras as its point of view, Chronicle shares a storytelling method with Cloverfield, the Earlier Blair Witch Project and the ultra-low-budget Paranormal Activity, but Chronicle, with its smarter, tighter writing and direction has more ideas and better executed ideas than you see in its ""found-footage"" predecessors and is simply a smarter and more emotionally satisfying movie.Watching it will make you believe that the ""found-footage"" movie has finally grown up.",5,"The ""Found-Footage"" Movie Grows Up!",1341705600,"07 8, 2012",2012,1555,"['Chronicle', 'latest', 'series', 'movies', 'using', 'well-worn', 'storytelling', 'techniques', 'first', 'seen', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'smartest', 'use', 'yet.The', 'story', 'three', 'adolescent', 'boys', 'who', 'stumble', 'something', 'vast', 'telekinetic', 'powers', 'Chronicle', 'cope', 'suddenly', 'being', 'able', 'do', 'practically', 'anything', 'force', 'will', 'alone.On', 'one', 'level', 'character', 'study', 'filled', 'themes', 'everyone', 'who', 'ever', 'read', 'comic', 'book', 'will', 'instantly', 'understand', 'recognize', 'level', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'action', 'film', 'one', ""n't"", 'leave', 'groaning', 'when', 'action', 'unfolds', 'things', 'break', 'down.This', 'due', 'large', 'part', 'surprisingly', 'well-written', 'script', 'expected', 'telekinesis', 'cliches', 'Did', 'do', 'Look', 'can', 'move', 'can', 'move', 'things', 'managerie', 'growing', 'power', 'reveals', 'growing', 'darkness', 'one', 'characters', 'leading', 'finale', 'price', 'admission.Using', 'unsteady', 'camcorder', 'footage', 'other', 'cameras', 'point', 'view', 'Chronicle', 'shares', 'storytelling', 'method', 'Cloverfield', 'Earlier', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'ultra-low-budget', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'Chronicle', 'smarter', 'tighter', 'writing', 'direction', 'more', 'ideas', 'better', 'executed', 'ideas', 'see', 'found-footage', 'predecessors', 'simply', 'smarter', 'more', 'emotionally', 'satisfying', 'movie.Watching', 'will', 'make', 'believe', 'found-footage', 'movie', 'finally', 'grown', 'up']",Chronicle
1465059,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005LAIGPA,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","What would you do if you suddenly had powers that no one else had except two friends? Would you use those powers for good or abuse them? Such becomes the question by the end of the film CHRONICLE.Andy Dettmer (Dane DeHaan) is the typical high school loser in the midst of his senior year. Abused by his father, he chooses to buy a camcorder and shoot everything that happens in his life including the attacks by his dad. Of course walking around all the time with a camera on your shoulder does little to make him any more popular at school.The only friend Andy has in his life is his popular cousin Matt Garetty (Alex Russell). Matt gets along with everyone and though he and Andy haven't chummed around for a while, he still tries to involve him. The latest event he talks him into is going to a rave on the outskirts of town. There Andy discovers that the popular kid in school, Steve Montgomery (Michael B. Jordan) actually knows who he is from their time in school together and because he's friends with Matt.The three of them leave the rave when Matt finds something, a hole in the ground nearby that seems fairly deep. They do a little investigating and find a glowing crystal deep in the ground that seems to have tendrils moving inside of it. As they touch the crystal the camera jerks around and suddenly it's the next day. To their surprise they discover that they have telekinetic powers now.Their powers progress and where they first start off doing goofy things like making baseballs sway when tossed to hit one another ala JACKASS, they soon discover that by careful manipulation they can fly. Apparently none of them has read or seen Spider-man or they would realize that with great power comes great responsibility.As the film progresses, we watch Andy's slow collapse. While he has this enormous power, perhaps more so than his two friends, his fragile mind can't handle it when coupled with the abuse he's endured by both his father and the kids at school. He becomes a time bomb waiting to be unleashed and when he does there is no telling what will happen next.As I watched this film I was reminded of AKIRA, the classic Japanese animated film where a youngster suddenly gains power and has the potential to destroy the world. But instead of a film that spends most of its time showing the main character overflowing with power, this movie tends to uncoil slowly as we watch these characters go from normal teens to potential monsters. You can feel nothing but sympathy for Andy after the physical and mental beatings he endures and at the same time fear him in what he becomes.The effects are well done and make the whole concept believable. The joy that these three have when they test out their powers makes for moments that are amusing and then fearful. Best of all they seem real.One note for those who are not fans of the genre. The film is another of those hand held camera movies where the camera jumps most of the time like BLAIR WITCH or CLOVERFIELD. But as Andy's powers increase he begins to stop holding the camera and guide it with his mind instead offering a more fluid movement to the scenes, making the camera motion almost a character as well.Some will hate this movie while others will love it but on the whole I think it falls into that medium area of being a good movie that you won't watch over and over again. It is worth seeing at least once, but as for multiple viewings I just don't see it happening.

Now, the movie- it was Really well done, and most of the time the way it was done didn't keep hitting you in the face.A lot of the critics talk about the power corrupting the 3 teens.  I don't agree.  The power just gave them more ways to bring out what they had inside already.Andrew was in an abusive situation, so he was feeling hurt, helpless, angry, and no way to strike back.  The power gave him a way to do that.  Unfortunately, it takes a LONG time for that emotional trauma to heal, and the power was fueling his anger.Matt, although he seemed popular and outgoing, we start to see that he has a more introspective nature.  When he sees harm to others, he backs away from causing any of it.  And at the end, you can see how much he loves his cousin and tries to help him, but ultimately he acts to save the ""world"".Steve I don't feel was affected too much.

In most super hero movies I wish they spent more time on the hero learning his new abilities. That was one of the things I loved about Chronicle. Wait, I digress; let's start at the beginning. Andrew is the kid in school you hope at least has a better life at home. He is constantly beat up at school and walks around behind a camera documenting the world around him. Usually his videos end up with his camera falling as someone punches or hits him. Poor kid has it just as bad at home. His father sucks too. Things appear to be very hard in Andew's home and dad either drinks because life is hard or Dad drinks because he is a tool but either way dad drinks and his poor mother is sick in bed, on oxygen and dying.One day after dad comes in and beats him, Andrew joins his friend Matt at a party.  After fighting with his friend he is lead to a hole in the ground by another guy Steve. Steve is very popular and wants Andrew to film this hole so that everyone can see it. They head down and are ""zapped"" by something. We never do find out what it is. Obviously something extraterrestrial.The next thing you know these guys have super powers of the coolest kind. The best parts of the movie is of them honing in on their powers.  They are having fun and enjoying their new found fame and friendship. Andrew is finally part of a group but then things change for the worse.This is a great movie where the actors are fantastic in their roles. The dialogue is real and made me feel like I was watching reality TV as we are seeing a lot in the beginning through the eyes of Andew's camera.If you like Sci Fi, this is a great movie.

1465065,A4RBWH5IMQBXZ,B005LAIGPA,"Michael Andrews ""movie buff""","[0, 0]","I finally watched this movie two nights ago after ordering it on blu ray, and I honestly love it. I dont know why it took me so long to see it. A gripping tale of angst and the notion of great power becoming corruptive, ""Chronicle"" tells the story of Andrew, Matt and Steve. Andrew is the teenage outcast who has no friends, lives with an abusive, out of work father who drinks excessively, and his mother is dying of a terminal illness. He takes to recording his miserable life with a video camera. Matt is his cousin, a cool kid who drives him back and forth to school and tries to look out for him. Steve is the popular kid running for class president. The three bond at a teenage rave, and soon discover a mysterious crater in the middle of a field one night. They explore the crater, go deep underneath it, and find a bizarre, crystallized object of unknown (possibly alien) origin.Later, to their surprise, they realize the object has bestowed upon them strange superhuman abilities, chiefly telekinesis and the power to fly. At first, of course being teenagers, they use their powers to play pranks (Using leaf blowers to lift girls' skirts, move unsuspecting peoples' cars around in parking lots, etc), but Andrew, the most emotionally put-upon of the three, becomes reckless and Matt tries to convince him they need to use their power responsibly and secretly. Over time, Andrew exercises his power to the point where it becomes stronger and stronger. So does his inner rage. He lashes out at his father, and even Steve! With his mother increasingly sicker by the day, he decides to use his power for selfish, potentially criminal reasons, with tragic results. It all accumulates in a very well directed and acted destructive battle across the city between a now out of control, psychopathic Andrew and Matt, who must do all he can to rein him in and stop this tragic menace.A great, even thought provoking screenplay by Max Landis and director Josh Trank, very strong performances by the three leads (Dane DaHaan as Andrew, Alex Russell as Matt and Michael B. Jordan as Steve), and amazing cinematography add to a fantastic film.

1465070,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B005LAIGPA,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[3, 5]","It's always been a dream of teenage boys to have telekinesis. Be it just trying to get the door close when you're trying to sleep or shoving the idiot who's driving behind you off the road, telekinesis is the ultimate form of passive/aggression.  Although the latest movie trend has been to depict realistic superheroes, few have truly committed to the format.  Chronicle is so steeped in its high school subculture that the word superhero is never even mentioned.Chronicle starts with high school and builds its plot from there: disaffected loner Andrew Detmer (Dane DeHaan), his more well-adjusted cousin Matt Garetty (Alex Russell), and popular kid Steve Montgomery (Michael B. Jordan) discover alien crystals.  The crystals vibrate and hum, inflicting nosebleeds on the three teenagers, all of it recorded by Andrew on film.  The camera winks out only to resume weeks later with a demonstration of their newfound powers.Chronicle's name is obscure but apt because Andrew films everything.  The entire movie is pieced together from Andrew's camera and -- later -- security cameras, news footage, and home video of the inevitable conclusion.Chronicle nails what kids with superpowers would do with them: They'd play pranks, of course.  Their powers are not limited to bending spoons however. Their telekinesis escalates from nudging things to shoving things to creating personal shields and eventually flight.  When that happens, all bets are off.In the beginning the triumvirate, bound by their collective secret, tries hard to support each other. Drunk fathers, social misadventures with girls, and high school popularity all gnaw away at their common bond. Also, a human being flying thousands of feet in the air is dangerous.Chronicle records all of this with the mundanity of a reality show, but it rises above the Blair Witch Project genre when it takes to the skies, where the wind roars constantly.  Some of the special effects are less spectacular - the ones that involve peculiar lighting, like a juggling talent show, are obviously CGI - but when it counts Chronicle's special effects are superb.Chronicle pulls no punches in portraying a broken home life and how a superpower only magnifies the pain.  The inevitability of its protagonists' fates is also the film's biggest flaw. It's no surprise who will take on the role of the hero and who will be the villain.But that doesn't detract from the breathtaking conclusion, a terrifying and (due to the multiple camera POV) disorienting display of telekinesis powered by human emotion.  It's worth the price of admission alone.It's easy to chalk Chronicle up as an unrealistic fantasy.  But I couldn't get it out of my head that if you replace the word ""telekinesis"" with ""gun""...the body count at the end of the film doesn't seem so unrealistic after all.",4,"When ""apex predators"" gain superpowers",1329609600,"02 19, 2012",2012,2818,"['always', 'been', 'dream', 'teenage', 'boys', 'have', 'telekinesis', 'Be', 'just', 'trying', 'get', 'door', 'close', 'when', ""'re"", 'trying', 'sleep', 'shoving', 'idiot', 'who', 'driving', 'road', 'telekinesis', 'ultimate', 'form', 'passive/aggression', 'latest', 'movie', 'trend', 'been', 'depict', 'realistic', 'superheroes', 'few', 'have', 'truly', 'committed', 'format', 'Chronicle', 'so', 'steeped', 'high', 'school', 'subculture', 'word', 'superhero', 'never', 'even', 'mentioned.Chronicle', 'high', 'school', 'plot', 'disaffected', 'loner', 'Andrew', 'Detmer', 'Dane', 'DeHaan', 'more', 'well-adjusted', 'cousin', 'Matt', 'Garetty', 'Alex', 'Russell', 'popular', 'kid', 'Steve', 'Montgomery', 'Michael', 'B.', 'Jordan', 'discover', 'alien', 'crystals', 'crystals', 'vibrate', 'hum', 'inflicting', 'nosebleeds', 'three', 'teenagers', 'recorded', 'Andrew', 'film', 'camera', 'out', 'only', 'resume', 'weeks', 'later', 'demonstration', 'newfound', 'powers.Chronicle', 'name', 'obscure', 'apt', 'Andrew', 'films', 'everything', 'entire', 'movie', 'pieced', 'together', 'Andrew', 'camera', 'later', 'security', 'cameras', 'news', 'footage', 'home', 'video', 'inevitable', 'conclusion.Chronicle', 'what', 'kids', 'superpowers', 'would', 'do', ""'d"", 'play', 'pranks', 'course', 'powers', 'are', 'not', 'limited', 'bending', 'spoons', 'however', 'telekinesis', 'nudging', 'things', 'shoving', 'things', 'creating', 'personal', 'shields', 'eventually', 'flight', 'When', 'bets', 'are', 'beginning', 'triumvirate', 'bound', 'collective', 'secret', 'hard', 'support', 'other', 'Drunk', 'fathers', 'social', 'misadventures', 'girls', 'high', 'school', 'popularity', 'gnaw', 'away', 'common', 'bond', 'Also', 'human', 'being', 'flying', 'thousands', 'feet', 'air', 'dangerous.Chronicle', 'records', 'mundanity', 'reality', 'show', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'genre', 'when', 'skies', 'where', 'wind', 'constantly', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'less', 'spectacular', 'ones', 'involve', 'peculiar', 'lighting', 'juggling', 'talent', 'show', 'are', 'obviously', 'CGI', 'when', 'Chronicle', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'superb.Chronicle', 'pulls', 'punches', 'portraying', 'broken', 'home', 'life', 'how', 'superpower', 'only', 'pain', 'inevitability', 'protagonists', 'fates', 'also', 'film', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'surprise', 'who', 'will', 'take', 'role', 'hero', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'villain.But', ""n't"", 'detract', 'breathtaking', 'conclusion', 'terrifying', 'due', 'multiple', 'camera', 'POV', 'disorienting', 'display', 'telekinesis', 'powered', 'human', 'emotion', 'price', 'admission', 'alone.It', 'easy', 'chalk', 'Chronicle', 'up', 'unrealistic', 'fantasy', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'head', 'replace', 'word', 'telekinesis', 'gun', 'body', 'count', 'end', 'film', ""n't"", 'seem', 'so', 'unrealistic']",Chronicle

1465074,A1AFXJ8U72MD6L,B005LAIGPA,"MISTER SJEM ""sonofhotpie""","[0, 1]",This is a the tale of an introverted senior in high school named Andrew. His mother is bed ridden and dying and his abusive stepfather is on disability and grieving that his wife will die soon and that he is no longer useful to society. To make it worse a lot of people in high school bully Andrew or just plain out verbally abuse him. Even his cousin doesn't want to be around him that much and tolerates his presence.That all changes when they stumble upon some alien technology which bonds the two cousins (as well as another friend of the tolerant cousin) and gives the three of them colossal telekinetic powers. Andrew's rage at being mistreated boils up and comes out gradually with abuse until he's literally out of control.On a basic level it's a fun tale about the loser kid getting revenge on those who wronged him horribly but on a deeper level it's about how we sometimes create the monsters around us. It also reminds me of some relatively recent moments in our history in which certain people who were mistreated turn violently on those who persecuted them.Almost all of the movie scenes are told through Andrew's beloved camera or other video recording devices. It is technically known as found footage.The film budget was only $15M but it made over $126M at the Box Office.

Oleson,"[21, 27]","I'm pretty sure that I've seen most if not all of the genre now called ""found footage"" films, going back the grandmother of them all ""The Blair Witch Project.""  I've liked some and not others pretty much like any other film.  One common thread is a theme of dread, relatively unknown actors and filmmakers, and low budget.  Fine, no problem.  Director Josh Trank throws a few wrinkles into the camera footage by not limiting the filming to just one camera.  This iteration incorporates a friend's use of a camera (school reporter doncha know), hospital security cameras, helicopter cameras, etc. and then shows it edited together to get the movie.Our 3 teenage ""heroes"" being a little tipsy coming from a party find a big hole in the ground and decide to slip into it and see what's what.  Some alien remnants (I guess) are discovered that put out some intergalactic emission that gives the 3 boys supernatural powers.  As they discover their powers, they begin to innocently play tricks on each other and eventually other people.  As their use increases, so does their strength.  As one points out, the gift is like a muscle.  The more you use it the stronger it becomes.  Eventually they do attain strength and even the ability to fly.  In other words, Superman/boy without the costume.One of the boys, Andrew (Dane DeHaan) has always been an outcast and socially shy.  His mother is gravely ill with some undisclosed respiratory problem and his father is an out of work fireman who hits the bottle and his son.  His cousin Matt (Alex Russell) is one of those cool kids but not in the athletic hierarchy.  Finally there is Steve (Michael B. Jordan) who is at the peak of high school cool.  An athlete, class president and on his way to a political career.  Eventually, Andrew realizes by using his powers he too can become cool, but alas he stumbles when he tries to bed one of his classmates.  He's never the same.  He becomes violent and tragedy ensues.Cousin Matt becomes the eventual voice of reason and tries to reel in Andrew.  The film certainly has its moments.  The interaction between the guys seems legit.  Yet there is something not quite right about Andrew complete personality change.  It's like Bruce Banner changing into The Hulk.  The other two are not affected this way.  Even at a crisp 84 minute running time, the final flying/destruction sequence seems to go on forever.  And I couldn't help thinking; did we really need to use the ""found footage"" technique with this story?",3,"3 1/2 stars for a new wrinkle in the ""found footage"" style of filmmaking",1328832000,"02 10, 2012",2012,2497,"[""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'not', 'genre', 'now', 'called', 'found', 'footage', 'films', 'going', 'back', 'grandmother', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'not', 'others', 'pretty', 'much', 'other', 'film', 'One', 'common', 'thread', 'theme', 'dread', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'actors', 'filmmakers', 'low', 'budget', 'Fine', 'problem', 'Director', 'Josh', 'Trank', 'few', 'wrinkles', 'camera', 'footage', 'not', 'limiting', 'filming', 'just', 'one', 'camera', 'iteration', 'friend', 'use', 'camera', 'school', 'reporter', 'doncha', 'know', 'hospital', 'security', 'cameras', 'helicopter', 'cameras', 'etc', 'then', 'edited', 'together', 'get', 'movie.Our', '3', 'teenage', 'heroes', 'being', 'little', 'tipsy', 'coming', 'party', 'find', 'big', 'hole', 'ground', 'decide', 'slip', 'see', 'what', 'what', 'alien', 'remnants', 'guess', 'are', 'discovered', 'put', 'out', 'intergalactic', 'emission', '3', 'boys', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'discover', 'powers', 'begin', 'innocently', 'play', 'tricks', 'other', 'eventually', 'other', 'people', 'use', 'increases', 'so', 'strength', 'one', 'out', 'gift', 'muscle', 'more', 'use', 'stronger', 'Eventually', 'do', 'attain', 'strength', 'even', 'ability', 'fly', 'other', 'words', 'Superman/boy', 'costume.One', 'boys', 'Andrew', 'Dane', 'DeHaan', 'always', 'been', 'outcast', 'socially', 'shy', 'mother', 'gravely', 'ill', 'undisclosed', 'respiratory', 'problem', 'father', 'work', 'fireman', 'who', 'bottle', 'son', 'cousin', 'Matt', 'Alex', 'Russell', 'one', 'cool', 'kids', 'not', 'athletic', 'hierarchy', 'Finally', 'Steve', 'Michael', 'B.', 'Jordan', 'who', 'peak', 'high', 'school', 'cool', 'athlete', 'class', 'president', 'way', 'political', 'career', 'Eventually', 'Andrew', 'using', 'powers', 'too', 'can', 'become', 'cool', 'when', 'bed', 'one', 'classmates', 'never', 'same', 'violent', 'tragedy', 'ensues.Cousin', 'Matt', 'eventual', 'voice', 'reason', 'tries', 'reel', 'Andrew', 'film', 'certainly', 'moments', 'interaction', 'guys', 'legit', 'something', 'not', 'quite', 'right', 'Andrew', 'complete', 'personality', 'change', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'changing', 'Hulk', 'other', 'two', 'are', 'not', 'affected', 'way', 'Even', 'crisp', '84', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'final', 'flying/destruction', 'sequence', 'go', 'forever', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'did', 'really', 'need', 'use', 'found', 'footage', 'technique', 'story']",Chronicle

It's annoying to see people (who are fixated with the standard comic book template) telling me how much more fun x-men is.No this is not the rise and fall of heroes or villains, rather a much more complex story that is probably more like the adult interpretations we find in Japanese mangas like 'akira'.It's the rise and fall of friendship, a group of kids who are bestowed tremendous power without limits. It triggers the imagination in a completely Different way. Nobody puts on a cape here. What would you do? And as it progresses it reveals the very realistic conclusion. An inner struggle to contain what is spinning out of control. The frustration of his cousin to contain the 'big secret' and the demise of our main character as he begins to take on a superiority complex.It unravels in a very realistic and thought provoking way.

I think this movie was pretty good. The storyline was unique and original. It gives you a much more realistic view point of how a every day teen would react to having super powers. The young cast did a great job, and it was filled with almost mind boggling action. This movie had the potential to be great, but the way it was filmed was a real draw back, at least for me. The entire movie is made like you watching a home movie. The characters constantly have out a video camera and record every miniscule second of their lives.  I understand the point. Its supposed to be a ""Chronicle"" of their experiences. But they could have pulled this off without showing it to us from the point of view of the film taker. This found that this limited the possibilities of the movie. Great action scenes are cut off as when the camera falls or gets broken. Or you just see clouds or clothes flapping in the wind, when you'd really rather see the expressions on the characters faces.  Making things even less realistic, Matt's love interest also constantly has a video camera on, supposedly for her blog. This feels very forced. Like a last ditch effort to make the relationship possible because they couldn't figure out a way to get Andrew to take his camera into the bedroom with them. At the climax of the film, which would have been absolutely amazing if filmed normally. But when you're jumping from street surveillance to random pedestrians recording the scene, its actually made me a little dizzy.

Out of all three of them, nobody said ""Hey, we better keep this hidden from, oh, I don't know, EVERYONE, lest we end up locked up in an underground lab for life for study.""I would have liked to have seen the story developed a bit more as far as what may have given this ability.

I suspected the kids would have been tracked down at some point before the last 15 or so minutes of movie.

One is seduced by that power and embraces the idea that he is the apex predator. He is at the top of the food chain and feels no guilt for his actions, no matter how they may impact others further down the chain.Chronicle movie posterWhat if you suddenly became a god?Director Josh Trank uses the hand-held camera technique to document the lives of three high school seniors as they become young gods after discovering an (alien?) force. There&#8217;s not much more to the movie than that plot summary so really, if you&#8217;ve ever wondered what if you gained super powers&#8230;and what would you do? The trick is to show us something that is so ordinary that it&#8217;s special and thanks to good writing by Max Landis and Trank, we get that. I&#8217;m not suggesting this is a greatly written movie, I&#8217;m suggesting that it has been written to steer us in a certain way that retains realism and believability.Blair Witch showed us how effective documentary styled filming can be and Cloverfield showed us how it can be used to bring on the cheese. You always have that nagging voice in the back of your mind- asking about tape and battery time and you wonder if someone would really, really be filming this much. In this case it works well and the camera slides into normalcy and you forget its first-person and just watch the onscreen action. The special effects are well done and seem even more realistic when combined with the lo-fi camera grain.Back to the writing. It&#8217;s important to note that what&#8217;s been written out is just as important as what&#8217;s been written in. There&#8217;s the clich&eacute; of the trio. We have a loner (Dane DeHaan), Mr Popularity (Michael B Jordan) and a too-cool-for-my-own-life pseudo-intellectual (Alex Russel). The reason they work well together is because each posses the qualities another lacks and it keeps them focused on group concerns: exploring their new powers and getting stronger.In younger days, I and my friends would play &#8216;Adventure&#8217; which was basically Dungeons & Dragons without the paper and dice. We would build scenarios and talk our way through our actions and create a story in real time. You do or say this and this is what happens after. You react and do that and here&#8217;s what happens next. In the earliest games, we spent our time exacting revenge on those that wronged us and getting the girl we wanted. Eventually thoughts about our real non-life seemed unimportant and we began to think about being super-heroes and fighting other beings with powers and becoming worldly beacons of justice. Really, we did.Chronicle could follow that same ambition process, but we are narrowly focused on this trio and the early days of their enhancement. High School life is still most important, and should be because that is all the characters know. We don&#8217;t get answers for where the energy source came from and do not explore any of the hinted at tangents -like the world and government reaction to some of the incredible events the trio is at the center of. There&#8217;s a built in break for using the hand-held documentary style because you can say: if it wasn&#8217;t filmed by this guy then we can&#8217;t show it to you. That&#8217;s broken up in some nice shots where surveillance camera footage is spliced in at key moments.Of course in any movie, you can criticize the actions of the main characters and figure you could have done better in their position. One character needs cash and so he robs the local (presumed) drug dealing a-holes. That&#8217;s not enough so he robs a gas station. At first I thought with those powers why isn&#8217;t he making tons of cash or if you&#8217;re going to rob something, rob an ATM or bank&#8230;but these are simple characters acting on impulse. This is a simple movie trying to explore what some would do if they suddenly became infused with super-human powers. Sometimes we come back with complex answers when in truth; it might all be as simple as this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and the ending had a much bigger climax than I expected.

1465099,A1F93NA8HQ47IU,B005LAIGPA,"Reconnecting To My Childhood ""Time Won't Let ...","[3, 6]","This film was a surprise for me. Judging from the trailers it really could have gone either way, good or completely terrible. I wasn't sure if I needed to see it but I enjoy the actor Michael B. Jordan from the series Friday Night Lights, I'd seen most of the other films already playing and so I thought I'd give it a try. Overall, I was glad I did. This film takes the superhero genre and the found footage genre (both of which have become more saturated than ever recently) and mixes them together for a fairly unique and definitely interesting experience.Directing: Surprisingly solid and inventive. If you hate shaky cam or hate how found footage always seems to be shot either from annoyingly too realistic angles or completely unrealistic angles then this film may still appeal to you. The kids powers allow them telekinetic capabilities and as the film progresses they start toying with the camera and using their powers to move it around or have it follow them. Along with that, possibly using that as justification, I found much more stable camera angles here, yet it provides the intimacy that found footage films benefit from when done well. The realism is well created, especially the first half of the film. In the later half when it turns into more of a low budget action movie I still found the directing and cinematopgraphy to be unique and well thought out, though the first half is my preference.Acting & Writing: Since the story is so simplistic, and it's hard to talk about one withour referencing the other, I'll just lump the two together. The simple idea of three kids getting powers is really the bare bones of the story, the film seems to purposefully stay simple in aims of showcasing good cinematography and well done directing, but there is some emotional meat thrown on for more sustenance. For example the conflicts that arise are well established in the beginning. Also the seeming lead character (his name is Andrew) has realistic and compelling life circumstances, nothing is going well for him, and it gives a reason why he starts videotaping things but also justifies his changes during the film. The three relative newcomers, I think they've all had some smaller roles previous (I already mentioned Jordan and FNL), do an excellent job stepping into the parts they are assigned as Andrew, Matt and Steve. These guys have a good rapport, they feel like friends videotaping themselves and goofing off with powers. It's a positive that it feels as though they were given the chance to ad lib and play things naturally and they do so enjoyably and within the larger overarching story. The first half of the movie is great fun and when things start to escalate and get more serious as the film progresses it feels justified, exciting and the actors do an excellent job of stepping up.Some things are easy to see coming and have been done before but here the majority of it is done in an understated way. One example, the idea that the boys feel the need to start setting rules regarding their powers, a fairly standard superhero theme, but played out amongst younger kids who are friends it becomes more interesting and genuine (in comparison to say an alien from Krypton deciding to be a symbol for good because he's almost a god).The unique aspect of the story is seeing three friends discover powers together and then actually act like teenagers while it happens. Spider-man had some scenes with Peter discovering his abilities for example but he does so by himself and then because they want to keep the character's virtues they can't have him do some of the stupid things you know real teenagers with powers would do. Here you see all those things, the goofing around and the trouble, it makes a standard story feel unique and fresh and also keeps things compelling for the majority. It's all very evocative of a more well planned, better produced and more entertaining youtube video in that sense.CGI: Isn't as overdone as most of the big action films, which is refreshing, it is used here to good effect. In some cases it looks really good and realistic, they definitely used some practical tricks which probably aid in this. It usually works best when done subtly. There are admittedly some spots where I had to suspend being critical of some less convincing CGI but it moves along at an even enough pace that it doesn't detract from the experience. Still the CGI is overall solid and actually impressive for a film that had a much smaller budget than some larger movies that do much worse. (I'll also say the CGI here looks more convincing than the wolves in The Grey, which was a movie I actually enjoyed, but good God those wolves felt like Twilight).I recommend giving this film a try if you want an interesting movie going experience that isn't quite the norm. If you want some action or a sense of excitement I found it to be more action packed and at least as exciting (probably moreso) than other recent films Man on a Ledge or Contraband. There is also a nice emotional core and all the young actors for my bet give the best performances to be found in this genre of film so far (again especially in the first half). It's a plus that unlike the horror found footage genre you don't have to hear a lot of shrieking going on off camera, here there are some astonished yells but we see what is provoking them and it all feels cohesive. This is one found footage style film that feels more like an experience than some sort of trickery or teasing. I give this 4 stars, I liked it and I would watch it again.**(I almost ashamedly admit that the well done execution of this film has me excited to see if the found footage genre can go some new places, Project X is coming and may be rediculous but looks like another attempt at something unique, with the amount of stock movies being put into production unique is a good thing).",4,Inventive

1465101,A39W3263A9HCMN,B005LAIGPA,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[8, 15]","One thing that always escapes me when it comes to this supposed found footage genre, which unfortunately has long grown stale, is how when the crap's about to hit the fan, the characters would rather turn their video camera in as opposed to running away. Yet, for some reason they seem to draw a lot of audiences. Look at the 83 minute exercise in audience trolling we got earlier this year, ""The Devil Inside"". Found footage? Check. Made a large impression at the box office? check.And so we have a movie yet again that sticks somclose to its found footage guns, Chronicle. The found footage genre makes its way to the superpower realm. A bunch of teenagers encounter a strange glowy green thing and auddenly have superpowers? Sounds like X-Men, doesn't it? Sadly it's nowhere near as fun, in fact, in the fun department, it's miles and miles behind.The film is taken from the video camera of Andrew (DeHaan, True Blood), a lonely, bored and abused teenager who lives with his dying mother and alcoholic, abusive father who beats him to a pulp on a regular basis. His only friend is his cousin, Matt (Russell, who could very well be Thomas Bangalter's long lost cousin). For some reason, Andrew feels the need to tape absolutely everything that goes on in life, and does so for the first twenty minutes on an old school over the shoulder camera.At a party one night, he and his cousin meet Steve, a character who unfortunately gets reduced to being the token black guy. They go into a hole where there's a green glowy rock and ta da, because of it, they have superpowers. Big whoop. They can perform telekinesis and stuff. Then Andrew gets pushed a tad too far, he can't control his powers, he loves being dark and evil, and blah, blah, blah. Oh and I'll note there several parts where Andrew plays with the camera using his powers.Like I said, this film is too found footage for my liking. First off, a good portion of the movie does a fail job at hiding the films heavy reliance on the gimmick.  A lot of shots show the camera being held by telekinesis and what not. There's a one scene I actually laughed out loud- it happens before Andrew's father visits him in the hospital, and the security guard tells him ""the camera has to stay on"". At that part, it was clear the movie lives and breathes the gimmick.It's a shame because the acting for the most part is well done. Dane DeHaan is exceptional in the role and he captures the essence of a poor teenager being driven to insanity and embracing his dark side. His performance really chilling- it's like a high school shooting, almost like you're inn he mind of the disturbed killer. Russell is great too as his cousin although at the end it's too he just wants Andrew off his freaking lawn. Steve is a decent actor as well.So what went wrong? What happened where i found the movie to be... Well, boring? Was I even supposed to care? Either way, this was one big headache of a movie and I certainly wouldn't be recommending it any time soon.",2,"Look up in the sky. It's a bird... It's a plane... It's...

Jordan as Steve Montgomery,Alex Russell as Matt Garetty,Michael Kelly as Richard Detmer,Ashley Hinshaw as Casey Letter and others.This is yet another Blair Witch Project,this time done through the eyes of three Seattle high school students.""Done"" is the operative word here,as in done this genre right into the ground and done terribly poorly.The film finds Andrew as the school loner.He has a dying mother and an abusive,alcoholic father.Andrew decides to start taking a camera along wherever he goes(quite convenient),and during a party his cousin Matt and his friend Steve take a walk in the nearby woods,and discover a strange hole.Steve gets Andrew to come and film it.In the hole they all go and they come upon a strange crystalline structure at the end of the tunnel.Whatever it is emanates different lights and strange sounds,and when they leave the tunnel their lives slowly start to change.They start to discover they have the powers of psycho-kinesis.Andrew develops it faster and stronger than the others.Whenever something untoward happens to one the others gets nose bleeds.There is a definite symbiosis going on here.At first they start out doing harmless lifting of various objects big and small.As their powers grow they have the ability to literally fly into the air and travel great distances.Andrew however is slowly but surely withdrawing from the others,his home life situation not helping any.After a confrontation with his father,he flies into the clouds and Steve comes to talk to him.It all ends as Andrew pushes Steve away so hard,he falls to earth and dies.Andrews mother grows weaker everyday and when Andrew has no money to pay for his mothers pills he starts robbing his school mates,then a mini-mart.However during the latter a propane tank explodes sending Andrew to the hospital.As his father sits by his bed he reveals Andrew's mother passed away that night.But because he was out looking for him he blames Andrew for him not being able to be there for his wife.As he stands over Andrew demanding an apology,Andrew causes a huge explosion to rip the wall out of the hospital room.This draws the attention of the police and the media.Matt is getting a nose bleed and knows something is wrong.He sees the kerfuffle on TV and speeds to the scene.He is just in time to save Andrews father who is thrown to the ground by a hovering and very angry Andrew.Matt and Andrew have a huge showdown over Seattle and it all comes to a disastrous end when Matt is forced to kill Andrew.The film ends as we find Matt in Tibet.Andrew had said earlier on in the film that they should travel there and they all agreed,except they never made it.This is Matt's way of fulfilling the promise.If I have to sit through another of these cheaply made,Blair Witch like films,I don't know....burning the disc is too good.The only positives I can say is that it is a kind of a neat idea,on paper,and the special effects were well done.Other than that this wanna-be life like picture is a total washout.As life-like as these films try to be,they really are far off the mark.For instance Andrews father belts him across the face and knocks him off his chair.He comes back up with a grimace but nothing else.Reality?....he should have been crying.But hey,this is Hollywood and REAL reality is a no-no.Just pretend reality.And the moral of the story,that man is not meant to have these powers?Yeah,yeah....they did it better in Star Trek,and long before that.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and extras include pre-viz stuff & a camera test.All in all another Blair Witch rip off,and done very poorly and uninterestingly at that.The moral is as old as the hills and just as lame.Highly NOT recommended.",2,This is

If you want a great example of just this sort of phenomena, look no further that the recently released and poorly named, Chronicle.  Shot on an almost ridiculously low budget by a director whose only previous experience was on cable television, it was released in the dead of winter - a time slot usually reserved for films that will soon be making their debut appearance in the remainder bins of your local Walmart.But Chronicle smartly rises above its humble budget and its inauspicious release date by offering something unusual: a nuanced psychological profile of a teenager struggling to rise above the ruins of his home life.  Mashing up the ""found footage"" and super-hero genres, it wisely avoids the rote stereotypes often found in films of this nature, and instead gives us a briskly paced meditation upon humiliation, empowerment, hubris, and naked aggression.By the time this pleasant little treat reaches its unexpected climax, the viewer is left wondering whether this might just be one of the more honest portraits of teenaged American life in the 21st century.  While the films are miles apart in tonality, one couldn't help but think back to Diablo Cody's Juno, an equally insightful look into the mind of modern adolescence.If you are a fan of the unusual and/or unexpected, I would strongly recommend seeing this film, in spite of its terrible title and its less-than-inspired marketing campaign.  This is the kind of film that heralds the arrival of a new talent, and I for one will be eagerly waiting in line when the creators of this film release their next work.Further reviews found at: bloodstainedink.wordpress.com",4,Chronicle: A One Minute Film Review,1358985600,"01 24, 2013",2013,1762,"['Sometimes', 'reasons', 'can', 'not', 'fully', 'explain', 'film', 'ways', 'studio', 'honestly', 'expect', 'want', 'great', 'example', 'just', 'sort', 'phenomena', 'look', 'further', 'recently', 'released', 'poorly', 'named', 'Chronicle', 'Shot', 'almost', 'ridiculously', 'low', 'budget', 'director', 'only', 'previous', 'experience', 'was', 'cable', 'television', 'was', 'released', 'dead', 'winter', 'time', 'slot', 'usually', 'reserved', 'films', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'making', 'debut', 'appearance', 'remainder', 'bins', 'local', 'Walmart.But', 'Chronicle', 'smartly', 'humble', 'budget', 'inauspicious', 'release', 'date', 'offering', 'something', 'unusual', 'nuanced', 'psychological', 'profile', 'teenager', 'struggling', 'rise', 'ruins', 'home', 'life', 'Mashing', 'up', 'found', 'footage', 'super-hero', 'genres', 'wisely', 'rote', 'stereotypes', 'often', 'found', 'films', 'nature', 'instead', 'briskly', 'paced', 'meditation', 'humiliation', 'empowerment', 'hubris', 'naked', 'time', 'pleasant', 'little', 'treat', 'unexpected', 'climax', 'viewer', 'left', 'wondering', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'one', 'more', 'honest', 'portraits', 'teenaged', 'American', 'life', '21st', 'century', 'films', 'are', 'miles', 'apart', 'tonality', 'one', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'back', 'Diablo', 'Cody', 'Juno', 'equally', 'insightful', 'look', 'mind', 'modern', 'adolescence.If', 'are', 'fan', 'unusual', 'and/or', 'unexpected', 'would', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'film', 'spite', 'terrible', 'title', 'less-than-inspired', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'kind', 'film', 'arrival', 'new', 'talent', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'eagerly', 'waiting', 'line', 'when', 'creators', 'film', 'release', 'next', 'work.Further', 'found', 'bloodstainedink.wordpress.com']",Chronicle
1465121,A1WFEHAV42HTM5,B005LAIGPA,Scrimshaw,"[0, 1]","Chronicle, a 2012 Science Fiction film directed by Josh Trank in his directorial debut, and co-written by him and Max Landis, the son of John Landis, who was notable as the director of such films as Animal House and An American Werewolf in London. Chronicle is a found footage film, which is a genre typically reserved for horror flicks like The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity, but lately is being used more and more for other genres of films, this and the teen comedy Project X being prime examples. Anyway, on to the film itself, it focuses on three high school kids, Steve (Michael B. Jordan), who is popular, outgoing, and running for class president, Matt (Alex Russell), is an average kid who has friends and does well in school, and his cousin Andrew (Dane DeHaan), who is a loner abused by his father and living with a terminally ill mother. At the beginning of the film, Andrew is already carrying his video camera around as he feels the need to record his life. He and with Matt go to a rave together and meet Steve there, who initially approaches Andrew because he wants him to record them as they go into this strange hole they found in the ground. The Hole is emanating these weird vibrating sounds every now and then, so they go into the hole to see what's making the sound and discover this strange glowing ""object"" which appears to be either a large crystal or UFO of some kind that causes their noses to bleed and they pass out. The film then picks up weeks later when they already have discovered the use of their powers and are testing it on a ball. At first, when they get their powers they just use them to goof off and have fun but later on the film takes a darker turn, mostly because of Andrew, and it's of course understandable. Personally, I felt Chronicle was a good film simply had too many flaws to make a masterpiece or even a great film. The idea was relatively original and interesting,a bunch of high school kids get superpowers but instead of using them to do good and save people they simply have fun, pull pranks and goof around, at least at first anyway. The biggest flaws in this film were, to me anyway, the fact that it was a found footage film, despite containing obvious CGI effects, and how it was completely unnecessary for the film, it actually took away from many scenes for me. Also how the fact that they were so open and nonchalant about their powers, openly using them in public where somebody might see them and possibly report them to the police or the government, like the CIA perhaps. I might understand if it was after they discovered how to fly, but it was actually before they did, so if the police or military wanted to apprehend them so they could use them as test subjects or as secret weapons for the military, they definitely could. Yet all three apparently are too stupid to be aware of this fact until after Andrew starts going bad. Another thing I didn't like was the very predictable plot and the very ""Hollywood"" style ending, which is another thing that took away from the ""genuine found footage"" aspect of the film. Now there were some good points to this film, most notably the action scenes, the dramatic scenes involving Andrew's home life, and the depiction of Andrew's downward spiral from weird outcast to raging psychopath, in ordinary circumstances someone with a history of abuse and tragedy similar to Andrew would probably end up either in prison, crippled, or dead due after reaching his breaking point. However, when he does finally reach his breaking point he possesses telekinetic powers and the ability to fly, so that just makes it much worse, and much more interesting! Overall Andrew is a somewhat likable and very sympathetic character who you could tell wanted to be good but ended up the way he did because of all the negativity he was surrounded by. It happens all too often in real life, and that really appealed to me. Concerning the strange object, it is never explained what it truly is, and that, combined with a scene towards the end which I'm not going to spoil, suggests to me that there is going to be a sequel, and if it comes out I plan on watching it, despite this being a so-so film for me, it intrigued me enough to watch a potential sequel, which is why it got a very appropriate 3 star rating from me. While this film was more of a Superhero origin movie, I feel the sequel is going to be a straight up superhero movie! I hope it gets made, and soon!",3,"Equal Parts Teenage Drama, Sci-Fi Action Flick, and Superhero Origin Story",1364169600,"03 25, 2013",2013,4471,"['Chronicle', '2012', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'film', 'directed', 'Josh', 'Trank', 'directorial', 'debut', 'co-written', 'Max', 'Landis', 'son', 'John', 'Landis', 'who', 'was', 'notable', 'director', 'such', 'films', 'Animal', 'House', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'Chronicle', 'found', 'footage', 'film', 'genre', 'typically', 'reserved', 'horror', 'flicks', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'lately', 'being', 'used', 'more', 'more', 'other', 'genres', 'films', 'teen', 'comedy', 'Project', 'X', 'being', 'prime', 'examples', 'Anyway', 'film', 'three', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'Steve', 'Michael', 'B.', 'Jordan', 'who', 'popular', 'outgoing', 'running', 'class', 'president', 'Matt', 'Alex', 'Russell', 'average', 'kid', 'who', 'friends', 'well', 'school', 'cousin', 'Andrew', 'Dane', 'DeHaan', 'who', 'loner', 'abused', 'father', 'living', 'terminally', 'ill', 'mother', 'beginning', 'film', 'Andrew', 'already', 'carrying', 'video', 'camera', 'around', 'need', 'record', 'life', 'Matt', 'go', 'rave', 'together', 'meet', 'Steve', 'there', 'who', 'initially', 'Andrew', 'record', 'go', 'strange', 'hole', 'found', 'ground', 'Hole', 'emanating', 'weird', 'vibrating', 'now', 'then', 'go', 'hole', 'see', 'what', 'making', 'sound', 'discover', 'strange', 'glowing', 'object', 'be', 'either', 'large', 'crystal', 'UFO', 'kind', 'noses', 'bleed', 'pass', 'out', 'film', 'then', 'up', 'weeks', 'later', 'when', 'already', 'have', 'discovered', 'use', 'powers', 'are', 'testing', 'ball', 'first', 'when', 'get', 'powers', 'just', 'use', 'goof', 'off', 'have', 'fun', 'later', 'film', 'darker', 'turn', 'mostly', 'Andrew', 'course', 'understandable', 'Personally', 'felt', 'Chronicle', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'simply', 'had', 'too', 'many', 'flaws', 'make', 'masterpiece', 'even', 'great', 'film', 'idea', 'was', 'relatively', 'original', 'interesting', 'bunch', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'get', 'superpowers', 'instead', 'using', 'do', 'good', 'save', 'people', 'simply', 'have', 'fun', 'pull', 'pranks', 'goof', 'around', 'least', 'first', 'anyway', 'biggest', 'flaws', 'film', 'were', 'anyway', 'fact', 'was', 'found', 'footage', 'film', 'containing', 'obvious', 'CGI', 'effects', 'how', 'was', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'film', 'actually', 'took', 'away', 'many', 'scenes', 'Also', 'how', 'fact', 'were', 'so', 'open', 'nonchalant', 'powers', 'openly', 'using', 'public', 'where', 'somebody', 'might', 'see', 'possibly', 'report', 'police', 'government', 'CIA', 'perhaps', 'might', 'understand', 'was', 'discovered', 'how', 'fly', 'was', 'actually', 'did', 'police', 'military', 'wanted', 'apprehend', 'could', 'use', 'test', 'subjects', 'secret', 'weapons', 'military', 'definitely', 'could', 'three', 'apparently', 'are', 'too', 'stupid', 'be', 'aware', 'fact', 'Andrew', 'going', 'bad', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'very', 'predictable', 'plot', 'very', 'Hollywood', 'style', 'ending', 'thing', 'took', 'away', 'genuine', 'found', 'footage', 'aspect', 'film', 'Now', 'were', 'good', 'points', 'film', 'most', 'notably', 'action', 'scenes', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Andrew', 'home', 'life', 'depiction', 'Andrew', 'downward', 'spiral', 'weird', 'outcast', 'raging', 'psychopath', 'ordinary', 'circumstances', 'someone', 'history', 'abuse', 'tragedy', 'similar', 'Andrew', 'would', 'probably', 'end', 'up', 'prison', 'crippled', 'dead', 'due', 'reaching', 'breaking', 'point', 'However', 'when', 'finally', 'reach', 'breaking', 'point', 'telekinetic', 'powers', 'ability', 'fly', 'just', 'much', 'worse', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'Overall', 'Andrew', 'somewhat', 'likable', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'who', 'could', 'tell', 'wanted', 'be', 'good', 'ended', 'up', 'way', 'did', 'negativity', 'was', 'surrounded', 'too', 'often', 'real', 'life', 'really', 'appealed', 'Concerning', 'strange', 'object', 'never', 'explained', 'what', 'truly', 'combined', 'scene', 'end', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'spoil', 'going', 'be', 'sequel', 'out', 'plan', 'watching', 'being', 'so-so', 'film', 'intrigued', 'enough', 'watch', 'potential', 'sequel', 'why', 'got', 'very', 'appropriate', '3', 'star', 'rating', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'Superhero', 'origin', 'movie', 'feel', 'sequel', 'going', 'be', 'straight', 'up', 'superhero', 'movie', 'hope', 'made', 'soon']",Chronicle

But the real question is what did you do with the power in your dream? Did you use it for good? Evil? A little of both maybe?Chronicle seemingly starts off as a drama about a kid in a Seattle high school that really doesn't fit in and progressed to a movie about finding that superpower that we've all dreamed about when we were kids. Okay, okay....that power we still dream about even as adults! To make things interesting this kid happens to be with his popular-on-campus cousin and one of his cousin's buddies when they stumble upon an object that grants them telekinetic abilities. The result is a sometimes funny, sometimes dramatic and a lot of times action filled movie that I pretty much enjoyed from start to finish.There has been no shortage of hand-held camera and found-footage films to come out in the past few years, and Chronicle adds to that list. Chronicle did the hand-held thing quite well without a lot of shaky footage and ""dropped the camera"" shots. But I still never got the point as to why the director chose the hand-held format versus presenting a cleanly produced film. I guess in this day and age of YouTube everything it just seemed like the ""in"" thing to do.Fortunately, I thought that the hand-held silliness was made up for by a uniquely written script by Max Landis (son of Writer/Director vet John Landis). And the mostly TV actor cast of three performed their roles with believability and emotion.While the final 15 minutes of this short 90 minute film were a little offsetting and not quite as believable, I'd still recommend this movie to any fan of the superhero genre.

It had depth along with some high octane excitement.Three high school boys get exposed to something that changes them physically, and they develop superhuman powers. It was a scifi, but it was more. It was also a story that went deep into what might happen to people if they were suddenly given god-like power over others and over natural laws like gravity. The movie chronicles what happens to the three boys who have vastly different personalities and lives.I don't want to give too much away by telling more of the story than I have, but it was really well done. The acting was excellent, the script really good, the special effects fantastic. I was entertained throughout.The only negatives were that the shaky camera style was a bit difficult to watch at times, and the story seemed to move slowly in the beginning of the movie.

I was actually looking forward to this movie. The preview made it seem a little ""X-Men"" like and I though it would be a neat idea. Almost from the beginning I was disappointed. I do however think that this is a movie meant for teenagers and not for me a 33 year old. To me this was a cross between a ton of different movies, most notably ""Hancock"" and ""Superman 3"", but really almost a blender full of movies. My biggest problem with this one is that it had no plot at all. This is pretty much a reality show about kids with superpowers. If scenes like the kids messing with some lady's car by moving it to another parking spot or eating chips without touching them with their hands is what you are looking for then this is for you. On a side note I think that the fake-documentary genre has run its course and needs to stop. Overall, a plot less movie that I think is geared toward teens, not for me. I give it a C+.",2,Finally the question is answered as to what happens when annoying angsty teens get super powers. One plotless movie.

1465146,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,B005LAIGPA,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[3, 4]","What? The first truly great film of 2012 is a superhero movie? And the words ""Dark Knight"" and ""Avengers"" are nowhere to be found? Both of those surefire blockbusters will have a hard time measuring up to the energy and realism of Chronicle, a film that shows having superpowers is about more than vague slogans like ""with great power comes great responsibility"", it's a heavy burden and one not everybody is prepared to handle.Over the last few years as comic book movies have all but overtaken Hollywood with brightly suited heroes in silly masks, only on occasion do we get one that dares to take a different approach. Movies like Kick-Ass and Super spring to mind, but those are really just deconstructions that don't take comic books seriously at all. Surprisingly, M. Night Shyamalan had the right idea a few years ago in what was quietly his best film, Unbreakable, a convincing and authentic look at the origins of a superhero and the man who would come to be his nemesis.  With Chronicle, newcomer Joshua Trank has tapped into that same idea, only with a healthy dose of teenage hormones and emotional volatility.For once, the annoying ""found footage"" sub-genre is put to solid use as Andrew(Dane Dehaan), a bullied social outcast begins documenting every moment of his life. He does it at first to capture the physical abuses by his father, but it isn't long before we see that there's no real escape for Andrew anywhere. He's treated just as badly at school, with his only friend being his popular cousin, Matt(Alex Russell). Andrew's barely contained anger and depression is only made worse by the worsening condition of his mother, slowly dying at home and the family unable to pay for the medications she needs.Trying to break Andrew out of his funk, Matt takes him to a party, where he's introduced to the most popular guy in school, Steve(Michael B. Jordan). Tell him that he and Matt have founded something really cool out in the woods, Andrew reluctantly follows them into a cavernous sinkhole, where they discover a strange glowing object. Rather than doing the smart thing and running for the hills, they touch it, forcing it to emit a piercing shriek, knocking the boys unconscious.Trank doesn't show us the immediate effects, instead skipping ahead in time, when the three have gained some knowledge of their mysteriously granted powers. In the beginning, these powers unite them as best friends, testing out their newfound abilities in silly exercises that could only spring from the mind of teenage boys, like creating a gust of wind to lift up cheerleaders' skirts. It isn't long before they start to figure out that their powers are growing exponentially the more they're used, almost like a muscle, and after Andrew goes a bit too far it's time to start setting some ground rules.But if there's one thing angry youths don't like, it's a bunch of people telling them what to do. Especially when you've been held back for as long as Andrew has. Seeing his powers as not only a means of exacting vengeance against those who wronged him, but also as something of a birthright considering the turmoil he's lived through. Exploiting it just enough, he's happy with the limited amount of school-wide celebrity it affords him, but it's nothing like the real popularity of his two friends. Jealousy quickly gives way to rage, and soon Andrew is on a dangerous, super powered tailspin.With a script co-written by Trank and Max Landis(the son of filmmaker John Landis), Chronicle puts a real world spin on what has always been the most interesting aspect of the superhero/supervillain divide, and that is how they came to be. The theory has always been that it takes a certain level of arrogance to become a hero, and an equal level of anguish to become a bad guy. In Chronicle, just as in most comic books, the one we deem the villain never sees himself as such, and it can be argued there isn't truly one in the film. Watching Andrew, Matt, and Steve develop into who they will ultimately become is consistently fascinating. While all three are perfectly cast, it's DeHaan who makes the biggest impression, and as Andrew his desperation to get out of his pathetic life is the film's driving force.That's not to say it's all good. While Trank makes rational use of the handheld cam, there are some scenes where it's presence doesn't make a whole lot of sense, even for Andrew who seems to be obsessed with recording everything for some future audience. The introduction of a love story between Matt and and video blogger named Ashley goes nowhere, except to make her a potential damsel in distress. She would have been better used as a point of contention between the friends.Still, these are minor complaints in a film that features a number of new faces I can't wait to see in other projects. While the budget isn't huge, Trank makes the most out of what are fairly simple special effects, saving the big stuff for the destructive finale that makes me think what a live-action Akira should look like. It's no wonder he's being looked at to possibly relaunch the Fantastic Four film franchise, as he knows exactly how to capture the wonder that comes with discovering the scope of amazing powers. As the boys put their strength to the test, they eventually learn to fly, and it's like we're right there with them as they savor this wondrous experience.Clocking in at only 80 minutes, Chronicle doesn't get bogged down in deep messages, and yet it still manages to be one of the smartest superhero movies we've seen in a very long time.",4,Breathes new life into the superhero

The story itself about three high school students with newly gained special abilities is rather contrived and even predictable, but with considerable storytelling skills, fine performances from the young actors and slick direction, ""Chronicle"" delivers.After touching some blue-ish glowing object hidden under the ground, three Seattle high school students Andrew (Dane DeHaan), Steve (Michael B. Jordan) and Andrew's cousin Matt (Alex Russell) develop telekinetic abilities. For the kids the new abilities are just fun, especially for a bullied boy Andrew, until things go too far and get out of control.They say, ""With great power comes great responsibility."" But what would ordinary high school boys do if they got some special powers? They are most likely to use them for something silly or trivial, if not evil. In ""Chronicle"" the kids are quick to find a new way to use their powers and enjoy themselves, but never attempt to be heroes of justice.Thus what is really impressive about the film is its realistic characters. Even with these new powers, some just cannot find their places in school or family. You may not like the film's found-footage style which is overused in recent years, but ""Chronicle"" still makes for an engaging ride.",4,The Kids with Supernatural Powers (And They Don't Save the World),1382486400,"10 23, 2013",2013,1402,"['Storywise', 'Chronicle', 'may', 'not', 'offer', 'anything', 'new', 'perhaps', 'provide', 'new', 'perspective', 'familiar', 'sci-fi', 'fantasy', 'topic', 'focusing', 'teenage', 'anxiety', 'story', 'three', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'newly', 'gained', 'special', 'abilities', 'rather', 'contrived', 'even', 'predictable', 'considerable', 'storytelling', 'skills', 'fine', 'performances', 'young', 'actors', 'slick', 'direction', 'Chronicle', 'delivers.After', 'touching', 'blue-ish', 'glowing', 'object', 'hidden', 'ground', 'three', 'Seattle', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'Andrew', 'Dane', 'DeHaan', 'Steve', 'Michael', 'B.', 'Jordan', 'Andrew', 'cousin', 'Matt', 'Alex', 'Russell', 'develop', 'telekinetic', 'abilities', 'kids', 'new', 'abilities', 'are', 'just', 'fun', 'especially', 'bullied', 'boy', 'Andrew', 'things', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'get', 'control.They', 'say', 'great', 'power', 'great', 'responsibility', 'what', 'would', 'ordinary', 'high', 'school', 'boys', 'do', 'got', 'special', 'powers', 'are', 'most', 'likely', 'use', 'something', 'silly', 'trivial', 'not', 'evil', 'Chronicle', 'kids', 'are', 'quick', 'find', 'new', 'way', 'use', 'powers', 'enjoy', 'never', 'attempt', 'be', 'heroes', 'justice.Thus', 'what', 'really', 'impressive', 'film', 'realistic', 'characters', 'Even', 'new', 'powers', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'places', 'school', 'family', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'film', 'found-footage', 'style', 'overused', 'recent', 'years', 'Chronicle', 'still', 'engaging', 'ride']",Chronicle

That's a popular icebreaker question and you can tell a lot about a person by how they answer it. Though there are numerous answers, flight and x-ray vision are two that often come up. Often those who answer ""flight"" are those who are extremely altruistic while those that answer ""x-ray vision"" are usually very self-centered and conceited. The possibility of humans, particularly teenagers, gaining such abilities is the plot device that drives the movie CHRONICLE.The movie is a ""found footage"" movie; it's a movie that portends to be actual real video footage that has been edited together into a movie. In CHRONICLE high school senior Andrew Detmer (Dane DeHaan) has been a virtual nobody his entire high school life. His father is an alcoholic who beats him. His mother lies in bed, slowly dying from an unnamed disease. Her illness has increased Richard Detmer's (Michael Kelly) drinking and in turn the frequency of Andrew's beatings. Andrew only has a few more months until graduation and he's clinging to anything that will see him through until then; if he can graduate he knows he can escape. Andrew's only friend in the world is his cousin, Matt Garetty (Alex Russell). Matt and Andrew are in the same class, but Matt is a popular student. He's the guy all the guys want to be like. Matt does small things to try to get Andrew out of his shell and says hi to him at school, but that's about it. Andrew buys a video camera to begin taping his life and it becomes an outlet for him. One night, Matt brings Andrew along with him to a rave. While there, Matt and his friend Steve Montgomery (Michael B. Jordan), who happens to be THE most popular student in the entire school, discover an underground cavern. They drag Andrew along with them to film what they have found. As it turns out the cavern ends up leading to a strange underground crystal and when they boys touch it their noses start to bleed and the Earth starts to shake.Weeks later, the three boys are best friends. They do everything together and it soon becomes clear why: there experiences in the cavern have bonded them and given them super human abilities. They seem to possess powers of telekinesis and impenetrable skin (forks and knives been when jabbed against their bodies). As the film progresses, the boys discover even more abilities. However, as they do so, they also begin to struggle with their own emotions and beliefs. Steve seems unchanged by what's happened to him, Matt begins to realize that he gave up his core beliefs to become popular, and Andrew struggles with an internal rage that threatens to consume him.I was surprised by how much I enjoyed CHRONICLE. I'm not a big fan of found-footage movies, for instance I hated THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and I thought the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY was laughable. However, I did like CLOVERFIELD. CHRONICLE is more akin in tone and style to CLOVERFIELD with a touch of M. Night Shyamalan's UNBREAKABLE thrown in for good measure. Until the latter part of the movie, CHRONICLE feels like film taken from a teenage outcast's personal camera. Andrew has a really difficult life. He uses his camera to show the world what he has to deal with: the beatings from his father, the bullying at school, his deep love and devotion towards his dying mother whom he can't do anything for, and the flippant way his cousin Matt treats him. As the movie progresses, the focus begins to change. Instead of being a chronicle of his life to show others his innocence, it becomes a chronicle of how Andrew changes and becomes the very thing he hates at the beginning of the movie.The overall plot of the movie is fairly predictable, but for a smaller-budget picture the director did a remarkable job of making the special effects look realistic. Also, there's some really great writing in the movie; the script allows for some very solid character development as the movie progresses. The effects and script are helped by some great acting. If this wasn't a sci-fi/action-drama, Dane DeHaan would probably be nominated for a bunch of acting awards for his portrayal of Andrew. Also, notable are Michael B. Jordan and Ashley Hinshaw as Matt's girlfriend Casey Letter. These are some actors whose stars will soon be rising fast.Overall, even though CHRONICLE is a found footage movie, it avoids many of the pitfalls of those films and through some solid special effects, exceptional writing, and impressive acting, it makes one believe that not only can a man fly (at least in the movies), but forces one to think about what the consequences of having such powers might be.",4,UNBREAKABLE With Kids,1330041600,"02 24, 2012",2012,4632,"['could', 'have', 'superpower', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'popular', 'icebreaker', 'question', 'can', 'tell', 'lot', 'person', 'how', 'answer', 'are', 'numerous', 'answers', 'flight', 'x-ray', 'vision', 'are', 'two', 'often', 'come', 'up', 'Often', 'who', 'answer', 'flight', 'are', 'who', 'are', 'extremely', 'altruistic', 'answer', 'x-ray', 'vision', 'are', 'usually', 'very', 'self-centered', 'conceited', 'possibility', 'humans', 'particularly', 'teenagers', 'gaining', 'such', 'abilities', 'plot', 'device', 'movie', 'CHRONICLE.The', 'movie', 'found', 'footage', 'movie', 'movie', 'be', 'actual', 'real', 'video', 'footage', 'been', 'edited', 'together', 'movie', 'CHRONICLE', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'Andrew', 'Detmer', 'Dane', 'DeHaan', 'been', 'virtual', 'nobody', 'entire', 'high', 'school', 'life', 'father', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'mother', 'bed', 'slowly', 'dying', 'unnamed', 'disease', 'illness', 'increased', 'Richard', 'Detmer', 'Michael', 'Kelly', 'drinking', 'turn', 'frequency', 'Andrew', 'beatings', 'Andrew', 'only', 'few', 'more', 'months', 'graduation', 'clinging', 'anything', 'will', 'see', 'then', 'can', 'graduate', 'can', 'escape', 'Andrew', 'only', 'friend', 'world', 'cousin', 'Matt', 'Garetty', 'Alex', 'Russell', 'Matt', 'Andrew', 'are', 'same', 'class', 'Matt', 'popular', 'student', 'guy', 'guys', 'want', 'be', 'Matt', 'small', 'things', 'try', 'get', 'Andrew', 'shell', 'hi', 'school', 'Andrew', 'video', 'camera', 'begin', 'taping', 'life', 'outlet', 'One', 'night', 'Matt', 'Andrew', 'rave', 'there', 'Matt', 'friend', 'Steve', 'Montgomery', 'Michael', 'B.', 'Jordan', 'who', 'be', 'THE', 'most', 'popular', 'student', 'entire', 'school', 'discover', 'underground', 'cavern', 'drag', 'Andrew', 'film', 'what', 'have', 'found', 'out', 'cavern', 'up', 'leading', 'strange', 'underground', 'crystal', 'when', 'boys', 'touch', 'noses', 'start', 'bleed', 'Earth', 'shake.Weeks', 'later', 'three', 'boys', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'do', 'everything', 'together', 'soon', 'clear', 'why', 'experiences', 'cavern', 'have', 'bonded', 'given', 'super', 'human', 'abilities', 'seem', 'possess', 'powers', 'telekinesis', 'impenetrable', 'skin', 'forks', 'knives', 'been', 'when', 'jabbed', 'bodies', 'film', 'boys', 'discover', 'even', 'more', 'abilities', 'However', 'do', 'so', 'also', 'begin', 'struggle', 'own', 'emotions', 'beliefs', 'Steve', 'unchanged', 'what', 'happened', 'Matt', 'realize', 'gave', 'up', 'core', 'beliefs', 'become', 'popular', 'Andrew', 'internal', 'rage', 'consume', 'him.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'CHRONICLE', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'found-footage', 'movies', 'instance', 'hated', 'THE', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH', 'PROJECT', 'thought', 'PARANORMAL', 'ACTIVITY', 'was', 'laughable', 'However', 'did', 'CLOVERFIELD', 'CHRONICLE', 'more', 'akin', 'tone', 'style', 'CLOVERFIELD', 'touch', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'UNBREAKABLE', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'latter', 'part', 'movie', 'CHRONICLE', 'feels', 'film', 'taken', 'teenage', 'outcast', 'personal', 'camera', 'Andrew', 'really', 'difficult', 'life', 'camera', 'show', 'world', 'what', 'deal', 'beatings', 'father', 'bullying', 'school', 'deep', 'love', 'devotion', 'towards', 'dying', 'mother', 'whom', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'flippant', 'way', 'cousin', 'Matt', 'movie', 'focus', 'change', 'Instead', 'being', 'chronicle', 'life', 'show', 'others', 'innocence', 'chronicle', 'how', 'Andrew', 'changes', 'very', 'thing', 'beginning', 'movie.The', 'overall', 'plot', 'movie', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'smaller-budget', 'picture', 'director', 'did', 'remarkable', 'job', 'making', 'special', 'effects', 'look', 'realistic', 'Also', 'really', 'great', 'writing', 'movie', 'script', 'very', 'solid', 'character', 'development', 'movie', 'effects', 'script', 'are', 'helped', 'great', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'sci-fi/action-drama', 'Dane', 'DeHaan', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'nominated', 'bunch', 'acting', 'awards', 'portrayal', 'Andrew', 'Also', 'notable', 'are', 'Michael', 'B.', 'Jordan', 'Ashley', 'Hinshaw', 'Matt', 'girlfriend', 'Casey', 'Letter', 'are', 'actors', 'stars', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'rising', 'fast.Overall', 'even', 'CHRONICLE', 'found', 'footage', 'movie', 'avoids', 'many', 'pitfalls', 'films', 'solid', 'special', 'effects', 'exceptional', 'writing', 'impressive', 'acting', 'one', 'believe', 'not', 'only', 'can', 'man', 'fly', 'least', 'movies', 'one', 'think', 'what', 'consequences', 'having', 'such', 'powers', 'might', 'be']",Chronicle
