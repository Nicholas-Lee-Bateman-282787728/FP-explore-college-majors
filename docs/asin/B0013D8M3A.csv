This DVD builds a little from Lara Hudson's 10 Minutes Solution Pilates DVD.  She cues very well and takes her time, which enables the user to be more relaxed and graceful.  What I like about her Pilates on the Ball is that she's creative with her exercise routines.  I would probably not see some of her moves in other DVD's.  She makes it look so easy while holding the ball still while I keep falling off.  She often tells you that the ball ""will get away from you"", so you won't feel so bad.  She's very encouraging and very detailed in her explanations.  If she comes out with another DVD on pilates, I would get it.",5,Effective for intermediates,1219276800,"08 21, 2008",2008,709,"['Here', 'great', '10', 'minute', 'solution', 'DVD', 'one', 'best', 'pilates', 'instructors', 'DVD', 'little', 'Lara', 'Hudson', '10', 'Minutes', 'Solution', 'Pilates', 'DVD', 'very', 'well', 'time', 'user', 'be', 'more', 'relaxed', 'graceful', 'What', 'like', 'Pilates', 'Ball', 'creative', 'exercise', 'routines', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'see', 'moves', 'other', 'DVD', 'look', 'so', 'easy', 'holding', 'ball', 'still', 'keep', 'falling', 'off', 'often', 'ball', 'will', 'get', 'away', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'so', 'bad', 'very', 'encouraging', 'very', 'detailed', 'explanations', 'out', 'DVD', 'pilates', 'would', 'get']",10 Minute Solution: Pilates On The Ball

Her soothing voice will prompt you from one exercise to another.  If at first you don't succeed, practice some more and you'll get it.  I always thought doing exercise on the ball was a lazy person's way of doing things.  Not so.  It is very difficult to balance one's body on the ball.  It challenges you to hold still (and thus firming up your abs) without having the ball moving away from you.  Definitely not easy but very, VERY, effective!

I have reached for this DVD many times when I want to do some core work.

1141373,A3HUC8541SJ6UT,B0013D8M3A,"B. Junkin-Mills ""brookemom""","[5, 5]","This is my first ""10 Minute Solution"" DVD and I am impressed.  I was skeptical but it's well put-together and you do get a good workout in 10 minutes, or a more thorough workout if you combine the segments.THE GOOD:The strength here is Lara, the instructor.  As a physical therapist I really appreciate that her form is stellar, and her cueing is spot on.  She may not be the most charismatic person but she knows what she's doing.The other strength is the format: 10 minutes is easy to find in your day, and it goes so fast that I almost always wind up doing two or three 10-minute segments.  There are four toning segments: Abs, Upper Body, Lower Body, Total Body - and one Flexibility segment.  You can combine them in any way you choose, although of course you want to do the stretching at the end.  The flexibility here, as well as the ease of fitting the workout into your day, make this a workout DVD that stays in my rotation.THE COULD-BE-BETTER:This is not a workout for beginners.  I know they don't say that it is... but they don't say it isn't either, and I think that beginners may be attracted to the ""10 Minutes"".  The workout intensity level is intermediate, but some of the moves are fairly advanced and difficult to perform correctly.  This is not for anyone new to exercise.  I think this should be stated on the box and also in the short intro clip.There is no warm-up or closing stretch.  Obviously, there's no time for them, I don't have a problem with that.  But again, the intro clip should explain not to start a workout cold, and to do either the 'flexibility' segment or your own stretches afterward.A little bit boring - Lara is very monotone.BOTTOM LINE:A good workout that's extremely well cued, and extremely customizable according to your schedule and fitness level.  2 or 3 segments together will give an intermediate exerciser a tough workout, 4 or 5 segments together provide an advanced workout.  Caution: Make sure you stretch afterward, and this is too advanced for the truly new beginner.",4,"Great Concept, Tough Workout - Not For Beginners",1247011200,"07 8, 2009",2009,2027,"['first', '10', 'Minute', 'Solution', 'DVD', 'am', 'impressed', 'was', 'skeptical', 'well', 'put-together', 'do', 'get', 'good', 'workout', '10', 'minutes', 'more', 'thorough', 'workout', 'combine', 'segments.THE', 'GOOD', 'strength', 'here', 'Lara', 'instructor', 'physical', 'therapist', 'really', 'appreciate', 'form', 'stellar', 'cueing', 'spot', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'charismatic', 'person', 'what', 'doing.The', 'other', 'strength', 'format', '10', 'minutes', 'easy', 'find', 'day', 'so', 'fast', 'almost', 'always', 'wind', 'up', 'doing', 'two', 'three', '10-minute', 'segments', 'are', 'four', 'toning', 'segments', 'Abs', 'Upper', 'Body', 'Lower', 'Body', 'Total', 'Body', 'one', 'Flexibility', 'segment', 'can', 'combine', 'way', 'choose', 'course', 'want', 'do', 'stretching', 'end', 'flexibility', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'ease', 'fitting', 'workout', 'day', 'make', 'workout', 'DVD', 'rotation.THE', 'COULD-BE-BETTER', 'not', 'workout', 'beginners', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', ""n't"", 'either', 'think', 'beginners', 'may', 'be', 'attracted', '10', 'Minutes', 'workout', 'intensity', 'level', 'intermediate', 'moves', 'are', 'fairly', 'advanced', 'difficult', 'perform', 'correctly', 'not', 'anyone', 'new', 'exercise', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'stated', 'box', 'also', 'short', 'intro', 'warm-up', 'closing', 'stretch', 'Obviously', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'again', 'intro', 'clip', 'should', 'explain', 'not', 'start', 'workout', 'cold', 'do', 'either', ""'flexibility"", 'segment', 'own', 'stretches', 'afterward.A', 'little', 'bit', 'boring', 'Lara', 'very', 'monotone.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'good', 'workout', 'extremely', 'well', 'cued', 'extremely', 'customizable', 'according', 'schedule', 'fitness', 'level', '2', '3', 'segments', 'together', 'will', 'give', 'intermediate', 'exerciser', 'tough', 'workout', '4', '5', 'segments', 'together', 'provide', 'advanced', 'workout', 'Caution', 'Make', 'sure', 'stretch', 'afterward', 'too', 'advanced', 'truly', 'new', 'beginner']",10 Minute Solution: Pilates On The Ball
1141374,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B0013D8M3A,Colleen M. Schneider,"[4, 4]","Here is what I love about workouts like this, you can choose your own workout-I can do 10 minutes if I just have a small break in my day, combine a few of the workouts or do the whole thing for a killer 50 minute workout.  These types of workouts are so good for making ""I can't find time"" an excuse of the past.  I found this dvd to be challenging with the ball (I do pilates dvds but pilates/ball is a whole different thing...).  The ball adds in the extra challenge of keeping steady while you are doing very controlled moves that target abs, upper and lower body or that work on your flexibility.  I am pretty decent at regular pilates, but I was an ""I Love Lucy"" episode on some of these moves, with shaky, bad shopping cart wheel types of movements rolling the ball in and out while my rear end was off the ground and I actually lost a grip a time or two when the ball was over my head, for a hilarious face bounce....hello, could we be an more uncoordinated at this?  Throughout though you are really toning your abs, and you do get better as you move through the exercises.  Do not let the 10 minute solution title make you think this is an easy work-out though.  You are challenged and I would consider this to be a intermediate to somewhat advanced workout for some of the moves. I would say this dvd is not for a beginner to pilates or the ball workouts.  If you are open to trying and failing a little I would give it a go.  I exercise daily but would say the ball workouts are sometimes a challenge if I haven't done them in a while, but they are oh so effective at toning.Overall, a good workout to help you build your core and work on balance.  Nothing tones the tummy more than Pilates and with the ball you are giving your workout a bit of a boost.  If you would like a different kind of pilates workout or need something with shorter, customized options this one may be for you.",4,mix and match for a 10 minute workout or a 50 minute.....,1342224000,"07 14, 2012",2012,1896,"['Here', 'what', 'love', 'workouts', 'can', 'choose', 'own', 'workout-I', 'can', 'do', '10', 'minutes', 'just', 'have', 'small', 'break', 'day', 'combine', 'few', 'workouts', 'do', 'whole', 'thing', 'killer', '50', 'minute', 'workout', 'types', 'workouts', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'making', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'time', 'excuse', 'past', 'found', 'dvd', 'be', 'challenging', 'ball', 'do', 'pilates', 'dvds', 'pilates/ball', 'whole', 'different', 'thing', 'ball', 'extra', 'challenge', 'keeping', 'steady', 'are', 'doing', 'very', 'controlled', 'moves', 'target', 'abs', 'upper', 'lower', 'body', 'work', 'flexibility', 'am', 'pretty', 'decent', 'regular', 'pilates', 'was', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'episode', 'moves', 'shaky', 'bad', 'shopping', 'cart', 'wheel', 'types', 'movements', 'rolling', 'ball', 'rear', 'end', 'was', 'ground', 'actually', 'lost', 'grip', 'time', 'two', 'when', 'ball', 'was', 'head', 'hilarious', 'face', 'bounce', '.hello', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'uncoordinated', 'are', 'really', 'toning', 'abs', 'do', 'get', 'better', 'move', 'exercises', 'Do', 'not', 'let', '10', 'minute', 'solution', 'title', 'make', 'think', 'easy', 'work-out', 'are', 'challenged', 'would', 'consider', 'be', 'intermediate', 'somewhat', 'advanced', 'workout', 'moves', 'would', 'say', 'dvd', 'not', 'beginner', 'pilates', 'ball', 'workouts', 'are', 'open', 'trying', 'failing', 'little', 'would', 'give', 'go', 'exercise', 'daily', 'would', 'say', 'ball', 'workouts', 'are', 'sometimes', 'challenge', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'while', 'are', 'oh', 'so', 'effective', 'toning.Overall', 'good', 'workout', 'help', 'build', 'core', 'work', 'balance', 'Nothing', 'tummy', 'more', 'Pilates', 'ball', 'are', 'giving', 'workout', 'bit', 'boost', 'would', 'like', 'different', 'kind', 'pilates', 'need', 'something', 'shorter', 'customized', 'options', 'one', 'may', 'be']",10 Minute Solution: Pilates On The Ball

I didn't love her Pilates or Rapid Results Pilates from this series, and I was also underwhelmed with her Prevention release.  Still, I wanted to see what she could do with the ball, and I have to say she was great.The first time I used this, I used the Abs, Total Body and Flexibility workouts.  The DVD earned five-stars that night.  Hudson effectively combined traditional mat Pilates with Reformer on the Mat movements in both the abs and total body sections.  Yes, I have done the majority of the exercises before, including the difficult Pike and Shell, but her explanations and set ups helped me connect them to their Pilates origins and get more out of the exercise.  The Flexibility section was deceptively thorough- I got off my mat feeling like I had stretched every muscle in my lower body, and that has been evading me for months.In the interest of thoroughness, I did the Upper Body and Lower Body sections the next day.  Wow- in the good way.  The Upper Body segment used a lot of movements I've done before, but this time with just the right set up to get the most out of every muscle of my upper body.  The Swan, Side Plank and Twisting (not sure of the actual name) felt amazing on my upper body- worked into the smaller muscles, but not so much that I couldn't move them afterwards.  The Lower Body workout was also very effective, although probably a little bit more recognizable, with variations on the Single Leg Kick, the Double Leg Kick and Bridging.  Regardless, I felt just as good when I got up off my mat the second time around as I did the first.In addition to being tough on Lara Hudson, I am also someone who generally turns my nose up on workouts that use the ball (or band or weight or what not) in every single exercise.  But I still loved this and would willingly do it again.Two thumbs up!",5,That's what I'm talking about!,1210550400,"05 12, 2008",2008,1915,"['loved', 'Lara', 'Hudson', '10', 'Minute', 'Solution', 'Yoga', 'expectations', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'high', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'Pilates', 'Rapid', 'Results', 'series', 'was', 'also', 'underwhelmed', 'Prevention', 'release', 'Still', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'ball', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'great.The', 'first', 'time', 'used', 'used', 'Abs', 'Total', 'Body', 'Flexibility', 'workouts', 'DVD', 'earned', 'five-stars', 'night', 'Hudson', 'effectively', 'combined', 'traditional', 'mat', 'Pilates', 'Reformer', 'Mat', 'movements', 'abs', 'total', 'body', 'sections', 'Yes', 'have', 'done', 'majority', 'exercises', 'including', 'difficult', 'Pike', 'Shell', 'explanations', 'set', 'ups', 'helped', 'connect', 'Pilates', 'origins', 'get', 'more', 'exercise', 'Flexibility', 'section', 'was', 'deceptively', 'thorough-', 'got', 'off', 'mat', 'feeling', 'had', 'stretched', 'muscle', 'lower', 'body', 'been', 'evading', 'months.In', 'interest', 'thoroughness', 'did', 'Upper', 'Body', 'Lower', 'Body', 'next', 'day', 'Wow-', 'good', 'way', 'Upper', 'Body', 'segment', 'used', 'lot', 'movements', ""'ve"", 'done', 'time', 'just', 'right', 'set', 'up', 'get', 'most', 'muscle', 'upper', 'body', 'Swan', 'Side', 'Plank', 'Twisting', 'not', 'sure', 'actual', 'name', 'felt', 'amazing', 'upper', 'body-', 'worked', 'smaller', 'muscles', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'could', ""n't"", 'move', 'afterwards', 'Lower', 'Body', 'workout', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'effective', 'probably', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'recognizable', 'variations', 'Single', 'Leg', 'Kick', 'Double', 'Leg', 'Kick', 'Bridging', 'Regardless', 'felt', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'when', 'got', 'up', 'mat', 'second', 'time', 'did', 'first.In', 'addition', 'being', 'tough', 'Lara', 'Hudson', 'am', 'also', 'someone', 'who', 'generally', 'nose', 'up', 'workouts', 'use', 'ball', 'band', 'weight', 'what', 'not', 'single', 'exercise', 'still', 'loved', 'would', 'willingly', 'do', 'again.Two', 'up']",10 Minute Solution: Pilates On The Ball

I'm of the view that pilates should be a bit less speedy and this is the sort of program that seems to prefer to take a more quiet form of excercise and see how jazz it can slap into it.  So if you're stubborn about having a quiet, peaceful, and slow pilates program, it might be wise to try another DVD.  But if you were thinking a 10-Minute Solution is all about cramming in the exercise and are okay with that, this should be quite pleasing.The program is separated into 5 ten-minute worksouts, each with a specific objective.  All of them are fun and effective, though I recommend this DVD to those with some prior Pilates training as the workout does move fast.  The programs are so easy to mix and match and, of course, they are all nice and short so even if you have time for one, you're good.

It can be hard to control at first and you have to get used to it.  For some people, this is worth the effort since you have to use a lot of control over your own muscles to control the ball, for others, it is too frustrating and not worth the potential learning curve.  So those who scored the workout badly because they did not like working with the ball did not give this workout a fair assessment.That said, I thought this was one of the better ball workouts I've tried.  A lot of pilates moves seem to work well with the ball.  The weakest segment was the ab segment --- while I understand using pilates moves for a pilates workout, one of the best things about the ball is the regular situp action you can get with it and these moves paled in comparison.  The strongest and most surprising segment was the upper body workout using your body weight and the ball.

I really like using the ball too, so that's what I was looking for when I start investigating for a pilates/ball dvd. This is superb.The ball is just the right too to help you balance and use all your muscles.I did laugh when she threw her legs behind her head to 'pick up the ball' and bring it back. You'll just have to wait to see that. Now I can 'almost' accomplish this feat myself. *pat on the back*My hips and thighs are slimming down but I am stronger. My knees, which hurt like the dickens, are not hurting anymore and are stronger. I feel good when I do this video. I like this instructor. She is clear and concise, except for that bit about pick the ball up behind your head... other than that, I give this an A+. You won't be disappointed.

It's cued very well by Lara and it's in the usual format of four workouts and a great 10 minute stretch segment.Obviously, each segment makes use of a stability ball and that enhances the effectiveness of the workouts.  It's great for your core and they use it in here to help increase your range of motion and it adds a balance element.  My favourite workout here is the abs section and like all the other workouts they do, you can program the workout to be done in any order or do only one or two or three etc workouts in one hit.  It really is a no excuse workout because anyone can find the minimum of 10 minutes, and before you know it, you might even increase it to the maximum 50 minutes and while you're doing this, you're having fun.  Lara is a great instructor and motivating too.I highly recommend this to practically everyone.  It's mainly intermediate to advanced, but doing shorter sections, beginners can gain a lot here too.  It's great for a total body workout and it's fun.

As with the other Lara Hudson's pilates DVDs, time flies and before you know it the workout is over.The butt/thigh segment is good. The stretching segment at the end is quite decent - probably the best I've seen so far in the 10 Minute Solutions series. I particularly liked using the ball for hip stretches - I now use always use it as a prop for that particular stretch.I would warn beginners off this DVD though: get a few months of regular pilates/yoga under your belt before attempting this workout. It would be quite easy to hurt yourself in some of the balance exercises, or just trying to keep up with Lara.

1141388,A3DXNZMKVXKUHK,B0013D8M3A,"Mrs. W ""Happy Homemaker""","[73, 75]","I began working out 4 years ago when I tried the 10 Minute Solutions Pilates DVDs and have been hooked on the series ever since.  I have tried other pilates (and other workouts) DVDs, but few have been as fun, enjoyable or effective as those in the 10 Minute Solutions series and this new one is no different.  I love the idea of using the ball in pilates, as it presents more challenging ways to get more out of the classic moves and it provides more innovative moves that are not as common.  I really love all sections of this DVD.  They are as follows:Pilates for Abs-This section focuses of course on the abs, but the ball intensifies the movements.  The other thing I enjoyed was that while I was familiar with many of the moves, there were some that were new or that put a new spin on the classic moves.Lower Body Pilates-One of the areas of the body that I find especially hard to work is the inner thighs.  This workout enables me to focus on them as well as the rest of my lower body.Upper Body Pilates-I was expecting to use weights with this section, as with the other 10 Minute Solutions Fitness Ball workout, but was surprised when they were not going to be utilized.  I wasn't sure if I would be able to work my upper body effectively or efficiently without weights, but I was pleasantly surprised.  This workout is a departure from many upper body workouts that I have done and really enjoyed it.Pilates for Flexibility- This section I used at the end of my workout.  It was very relaxing and I could feel the muscles stretch after a very challenging 40 minute workout.  I can see me just popping this on after a hard day at the office.  It is relaxing, but stretches and relaxes all of your muscles very well.Total Body Pilates-It's just that, a great mixture of exercises to tone and work the entire body.  I really thought there was a nice variety of moves to work every area very well.Overall, I completely recommend this workout. I consider myself at an intermediate/advanced level and I found this to be very challenging.  Some of the exercises that are more difficult I will have to work up to, so I can continue to advance with this DVD.  I also love the instructor.  She was pleasant without being obnoxious.  Her cuing and instruction was impeccable.  This will be in regular rotation in my workout schedule.
