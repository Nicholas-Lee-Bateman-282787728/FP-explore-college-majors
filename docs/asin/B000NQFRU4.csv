I just had surgery and figured that I would watch these series's to visit many of my favorite actors and episodes. I had not watched them for a long time. What is it with these DVD producers? They were released around 2003 and yet they have no CC's or subtitles. This is no way to treat loyal fans. The music has been made louder but the dialogue is now too soft to hear over the music. There are many people with decreased hearing not only due to aging and not all of the people who enjoyed these shows were in their early 20's to 30's, teenagers, or younger! It seems to me that the DVD's should at least be replaced with ones that have CC's and/or subtitles. 5 stars for the shows with no stars for the DVD companies who released these shows.",3,No closed captioning,1220313600,"09 2, 2008",2008,851,"['loved', 'series', 'Xena', 'Highlander', 'Raven', 'purchased', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'then', 'DVD', 'just', 'had', 'surgery', 'figured', 'would', 'watch', 'series', 'visit', 'many', 'favorite', 'actors', 'episodes', 'had', 'not', 'watched', 'long', 'time', 'What', 'DVD', 'producers', 'were', 'released', '2003', 'yet', 'have', 'CC', 'subtitles', 'way', 'treat', 'loyal', 'fans', 'music', 'been', 'made', 'louder', 'dialogue', 'now', 'too', 'soft', 'hear', 'music', 'are', 'many', 'people', 'decreased', 'hearing', 'not', 'only', 'due', 'aging', 'not', 'people', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'shows', 'were', 'early', '20', '30', 'teenagers', 'younger', 'DVD', 'should', 'least', 'be', 'replaced', 'ones', 'have', 'CC', 'and/or', 'subtitles', '5', 'stars', 'shows', 'stars', 'DVD', 'companies', 'who', 'released', 'shows']",N/A

Wright,"[26, 26]","This is one of the best investments for the money... the location in New Zealand has the most beautiful scenery of anywhere, so having all the action set against that background made the series even more enjoyable.  Kevin Sorbo is a pleasure to look at, you learn a lesson in each episode, and also you don't have to fight every time to get people to listen. That's what he tries to accomplish. His buddy and best friend, played by Michael Hurst, is a great compliment to the fun and adventure of the show. His energy and Hercule's steadfastness go hand-in hand rounding out each episode making each one an enjoyable feast. Even though you can pretty much figure out that you have bullies to put down, the stories are good, the action is tops, and the bullies can sure take a fall !!

I'm only on season two and it's not as good as I remembered. I think it got better when Kevin Smith, Ares, shows up in later episodes. Anyway, Hercules still saves the day but Xena did it better.

If you have never seen the series, but are a fan of shows that are comedic, have action and adventure, and are a bit campy, then you'd like the series.  Kevin Sorbo and Michael Hurst are great in most of the episodes.  The guest starring characters are, for the most part, wonderful character actors.  I preferred the later seasons, because the effects and the material became better, but  all of the seasons were good in their own way.  I loved the commentaries on all of the episodes.  But then, I love behind the scenes stuff. Kevin and Michael both did commentaries throughout the series - mostly Kevin, but the later episodes had some with both of them in the commentaries.  Also plenty of interviews of the stars and some of the writers/directors/producers.
