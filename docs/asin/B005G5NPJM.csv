1459971,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B005G5NPJM,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","Kevin Smith is a smart funny guy. Too Fat For 40 is a decent nearly two hour monologue. There are side splitting funny moments and then there are those moments where he went on a bit too long. Overall, this is a good watch, one time, no real repeat value here.In some ways Kevin Smith has gone past his use by date. Maybe I've just heard him too much, with his podcast, many interviews on television and the radio, and all of his movies; his message is getting a little bit long in the tooth. He's still a funny guy, and enjoyable; he's just a little more predictable.This event was funny overall. He claims it's a Q and A, and well, yes there is question and answers. This was recorded a while after his Southwest Airlines mess, so he doesn't rant about it. Some of the images of him with his wife are excellent. And he really has come to full comfort with his weight.I think his 2006 stand up was much better. In fact I still do some of the stupid quotes from that event with my son (comics still gets a smile from both of us).An Evening With Kevin Smith 2: Evening HarderAs with everything Kevin Smith, there is strong language, and the jokes run the gamut of all sexual orientations. Even though this is not rated, it is certainly mature humor. Sensitive viewers need not apply. A simple test, a recurring joke is about a fat man being serviced by another guy. The fat guy lifts his belly and slaps the other guy's head with his belly at the big moment. If that isn't offensive, then this movie will be just fine.Wish it was a little funnier, but is well worth watching.",4,"Well Yeah, It's Kevin Smith, He's a funny guy",1323388800,"12 9, 2011",2011,1574,"['Kevin', 'Smith', 'smart', 'funny', 'guy', 'Too', 'Fat', '40', 'decent', 'nearly', 'two', 'hour', 'monologue', 'are', 'side', 'splitting', 'funny', 'moments', 'then', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'went', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'Overall', 'good', 'watch', 'one', 'time', 'real', 'repeat', 'value', 'here.In', 'ways', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'gone', 'use', 'date', 'Maybe', ""'ve"", 'just', 'heard', 'too', 'much', 'podcast', 'many', 'interviews', 'television', 'radio', 'movies', 'message', 'getting', 'little', 'bit', 'long', 'tooth', 'still', 'funny', 'guy', 'enjoyable', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'predictable.This', 'event', 'was', 'funny', 'overall', 'Q', 'A', 'well', 'yes', 'question', 'answers', 'was', 'recorded', 'while', 'Southwest', 'Airlines', 'mess', ""n't"", 'rant', 'images', 'wife', 'are', 'excellent', 'really', 'come', 'full', 'comfort', 'weight.I', 'think', '2006', 'stand', 'up', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'fact', 'still', 'do', 'stupid', 'quotes', 'event', 'son', 'comics', 'still', 'smile', 'Evening', 'Kevin', 'Smith', '2', 'Evening', 'HarderAs', 'everything', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'strong', 'language', 'jokes', 'run', 'gamut', 'sexual', 'orientations', 'Even', 'not', 'rated', 'certainly', 'mature', 'humor', 'Sensitive', 'viewers', 'need', 'not', 'apply', 'simple', 'test', 'recurring', 'joke', 'fat', 'man', 'being', 'serviced', 'guy', 'fat', 'guy', 'belly', 'slaps', 'other', 'guy', 'head', 'belly', 'big', 'moment', ""n't"", 'offensive', 'then', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'fine.Wish', 'was', 'little', 'funnier', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",Kevin Smith: Too Fat For 40
