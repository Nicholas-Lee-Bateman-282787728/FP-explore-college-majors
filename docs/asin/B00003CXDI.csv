Having read the book, to me he plays the character of Grady all wrong. He's too &quot;Michael Douglas&quot; for a start, overdoes the cute comedy act, looks just too unappealing for us to believe that the Chancellor could be interested in him.And there are clumsy moments, like when the book falls out of the car, and scenes that are electrifying in the novel and thrown away in the film. They even missed out one of the best sequences...Robert Downey Jr is excellent though, and the interplay between him and the James Leer character is very well done.

I really got mad after reading through some of the comments other's made about this movie. I never had any sort of intention to review this movie, but people's comments enraged me so I had to.  As we should all know by now this was the first movie Curtis Hanson made after &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;. I never understood why the public makes such a big deal about a director's next project after they have a hit. Why don't they concern themself with the hit movie instead? Anyway, I saw &quot;Wonder Boys&quot; when it came out in theathers, and I really enjoyed it. I thought the acting by the entire cast had it moments. Everyone at one point of the film was given a scene where they were allowed to shine. Michael Douglas plays Grady Tripp, a struggling novelist, who had a hit novel once before, but for some reason can't seem to finish his new novel. It already is well over a 1,000 pages. If that isn't bad enough for Tripp, he finds out that his friend\editor (Robert Downey Jr.) is coming in town to check up on how Gripp's novel is going. His girlfriend\mistress has just informed him that she is going to have a baby, she is played quite amusingly by Francis McDormand. And, his wife is now going to divorce him. Yep, it sounds like the begining of a perfect day for Grady Tripp. Now, why the American public has a problem with this story-line is beyond me. If I were to read this on someone else's review I would think it sounds like a good,funny comedy that would seem enjoyable to watch. The movie based on a novel by Michael Chabon, with a screenplay by Steven Kloves does have it's moments of sentiment and laughter. It's tender while being humorous. And that's why I like the movie. It tries to seem &quot;human&quot; while it's outragous at the same time. When thinking back on the movie it sorta reminds me of old screwball comedies. Not that the movie has slapstick to it, but if you've ever seen movies like &quot;The Awful Truth&quot;, you'll know what I'm talking about. I read one reviewer bash the title of the movie, OK, now, we're going to far, now we're just bashing the movie just for the sake of bashing it. That, is not a good reason to say you hate a movie, I'm sorry. You have to give a better reason then that. Comment on the acting, the screenplay, the directing, but not the title! I only take one star off this movie because I felt that it would of been better if they went into the whole Katie Holmes (Hannah Green)\ Michael Douglas relationship. This was a great movie, one I really enjoyed, and it in my opinion was one of the best films of 2000! Everyone should try to make an effort to see this movie. Those that have and didn't enjoy it, I'm sorry you had such an awful time, let some time pass and try to watch the movie again, who knows, maybe you might like it.",4,"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.......",988848000,"05 3, 2001",2001,2871,"['know', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'let', 'got', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'really', 'got', 'mad', 'reading', 'comments', 'other', 'made', 'movie', 'never', 'had', 'sort', 'intention', 'review', 'movie', 'people', 'comments', 'enraged', 'had', 'should', 'know', 'now', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'made', 'quot', 'L.A.', 'Confidential', 'quot', 'never', 'understood', 'why', 'public', 'big', 'deal', 'director', 'next', 'project', 'have', 'hit', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'concern', 'hit', 'movie', 'instead', 'Anyway', 'saw', 'quot', 'Wonder', 'Boys', 'quot', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'theathers', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'thought', 'acting', 'entire', 'cast', 'had', 'Everyone', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'was', 'given', 'scene', 'where', 'were', 'allowed', 'shine', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Grady', 'Tripp', 'struggling', 'novelist', 'who', 'had', 'hit', 'novel', 'once', 'before', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'finish', 'new', 'novel', 'already', 'well', '1,000', 'pages', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'Tripp', 'out', 'friend\\editor', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'coming', 'town', 'check', 'up', 'how', 'Gripp', 'novel', 'going', 'girlfriend\\mistress', 'just', 'informed', 'going', 'have', 'baby', 'played', 'quite', 'amusingly', 'Francis', 'McDormand', 'wife', 'now', 'going', 'divorce', 'Yep', 'begining', 'perfect', 'day', 'Grady', 'Tripp', 'Now', 'why', 'American', 'public', 'problem', 'story-line', 'were', 'read', 'someone', 'else', 'review', 'would', 'think', 'good', 'funny', 'comedy', 'would', 'seem', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'movie', 'based', 'novel', 'Michael', 'Chabon', 'screenplay', 'Steven', 'Kloves', 'have', 'moments', 'sentiment', 'laughter', 'tender', 'being', 'humorous', 'why', 'like', 'movie', 'seem', 'quot', 'human', 'quot', 'outragous', 'same', 'time', 'When', 'thinking', 'back', 'movie', 'sorta', 'old', 'screwball', 'comedies', 'Not', 'movie', 'slapstick', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movies', 'quot', 'Awful', 'Truth', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'read', 'one', 'reviewer', 'bash', 'title', 'movie', 'OK', 'now', ""'re"", 'going', 'far', 'now', ""'re"", 'just', 'bashing', 'movie', 'just', 'sake', 'bashing', 'not', 'good', 'reason', 'say', 'hate', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'have', 'give', 'better', 'reason', 'then', 'Comment', 'acting', 'screenplay', 'directing', 'not', 'title', 'only', 'take', 'one', 'star', 'movie', 'felt', 'would', 'been', 'better', 'went', 'whole', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Hannah', 'Green', '\\', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'relationship', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'one', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'opinion', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2000', 'Everyone', 'should', 'try', 'make', 'effort', 'see', 'movie', 'have', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'had', 'such', 'awful', 'time', 'let', 'time', 'pass', 'try', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'who', 'maybe', 'might', 'like']",N/A

522526,AK6UVFSU07NXH,B00003CXDI,Anthony Hinde,"[3, 3]","Many creative people strive for perfection, especially in their first true work. Amongst other things, ""Wonderboys"" explores what might happen if perfection was actually achieved. Professor Grady Tripp, (Michael Douglas), is a lecturer in Creative Writing whose first novel was a critical success. That was seven years ago and he is still working on his follow-up work. Many of his students admire him, he smokes a lot of dope, is having an affair with  his boss's wife and occasionally becomes unconscious for no apparent reason. He is a man without ambition, coasting through life. Mildly jealous of those who still show a passion for life, he becomes entangled in the world of one of his students, James Leer (Toby Maguire), who manages to show even less passion for existence than the professor.James is recognised by his peers as being both weird, in an introverted semi-postal way, and yet more talented than the rest of them put together. Their half-hearted attempts to pull him down to their level are ignored, leaving James mired in his own depressing view of reality. It's even possible that he has chosen Professor Tripp as his mentor; somehow hoping that someone, almost as disconnected from reality as himself and yet capable of publishing a seminal work, might be able to show James a way through the maze. In a way, this is exactly what happens, but not in any sort of linear fashion. While the film largely follows the professor's point of view, James is often the one our sympathies are drawn to. He lies constantly, in such a creative and self-consistent way, that no one truly knows what is going on in his life. It's as if he is testing plot lines on an unsuspecting audience in an effort to hone his story-telling skills.Despite concentrating on these two  characters, the film is an ensemble piece, chock full of minor but lovingly crafted people that, for the most part, we'd love to get to know better. Tripp's Editor, Terry Crabtree, (Robert Downey Jr.), is an unsuccessful man who has little confidence but an irrepressible energy; seemingly determined to dance until someone shuts off the stage lights. Tripp's student boarder, Hannah Green, (Katie Holmes), is one of the saner characters in the film. She feels a natural admiration for her teacher; a feeling which she tries to promote into a more adult relationship following the off-screen departure of his young wife. How any flesh and blood man could reject Hannah's scantily clad advances is beyond my understanding, nevertheless that's exactly what Grady does.The dean of the college, Sara Gaskell, (Francis  McDormand), who is also Professor Tripp's girl friend, is married to the Dean of English, Walter Gaskell, (Richard Thomas), a clueless boor who obsesses over Marilyn Munroe and Joe DiMaggio. Sara truly loves Tripp and yet sees him for the rudderless ship he is. She is very centered, confident and assertive; firmly placing the emotional ball in Tripp's court. He must decide what he wants or loose the only thing he still seems to enjoy in his post novel depression. As you might imagine, when all of these interesting people are thrown into the mix; along with a murdered dog, stolen memorabilia, an enormous novel that can't find an ending and a determined ex-jockey car thief possibly named Vernon; nobody can predict the result. The only certainty is that it will make for an interesting ride. As Director Chris Hanson says, ""All the characters are disparate and yet similar in certain ways. They're all mucking around trying to figure out their lives, just like we are - only they're more amusing along the way.""",5,Prof. Tripp is over 50 and just coming of age.,1045267200,"02 15, 2003",2003,3611,"['Many', 'creative', 'people', 'strive', 'perfection', 'especially', 'first', 'true', 'work', 'Amongst', 'other', 'things', 'Wonderboys', 'what', 'might', 'happen', 'perfection', 'was', 'actually', 'achieved', 'Professor', 'Grady', 'Tripp', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'lecturer', 'Creative', 'Writing', 'first', 'novel', 'was', 'critical', 'success', 'was', 'seven', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'working', 'follow-up', 'work', 'Many', 'students', 'admire', 'lot', 'dope', 'having', 'affair', 'boss', 'wife', 'occasionally', 'unconscious', 'apparent', 'reason', 'man', 'ambition', 'coasting', 'life', 'Mildly', 'jealous', 'who', 'still', 'show', 'passion', 'life', 'entangled', 'world', 'one', 'students', 'James', 'Leer', 'Toby', 'Maguire', 'who', 'show', 'even', 'less', 'passion', 'existence', 'professor.James', 'recognised', 'peers', 'being', 'weird', 'introverted', 'semi-postal', 'way', 'yet', 'more', 'talented', 'rest', 'put', 'together', 'half-hearted', 'attempts', 'pull', 'down', 'level', 'are', 'ignored', 'leaving', 'James', 'mired', 'own', 'depressing', 'view', 'reality', 'even', 'possible', 'chosen', 'Professor', 'Tripp', 'mentor', 'hoping', 'someone', 'almost', 'disconnected', 'reality', 'yet', 'capable', 'publishing', 'seminal', 'work', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'show', 'James', 'way', 'maze', 'way', 'exactly', 'what', 'not', 'sort', 'linear', 'fashion', 'film', 'largely', 'professor', 'point', 'view', 'James', 'often', 'one', 'sympathies', 'are', 'drawn', 'constantly', 'creative', 'self-consistent', 'way', 'one', 'truly', 'what', 'going', 'life', 'testing', 'plot', 'lines', 'unsuspecting', 'audience', 'effort', 'hone', 'story-telling', 'skills.Despite', 'concentrating', 'two', 'characters', 'film', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'chock', 'full', 'minor', 'lovingly', 'crafted', 'people', 'most', 'part', ""'d"", 'love', 'get', 'know', 'better', 'Tripp', 'Editor', 'Terry', 'Crabtree', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'unsuccessful', 'man', 'who', 'little', 'confidence', 'irrepressible', 'energy', 'seemingly', 'determined', 'dance', 'someone', 'shuts', 'stage', 'lights', 'Tripp', 'student', 'boarder', 'Hannah', 'Green', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'one', 'saner', 'characters', 'film', 'natural', 'admiration', 'teacher', 'feeling', 'promote', 'more', 'adult', 'relationship', 'following', 'off-screen', 'departure', 'young', 'wife', 'How', 'flesh', 'blood', 'man', 'could', 'reject', 'Hannah', 'scantily', 'clad', 'advances', 'understanding', 'nevertheless', 'exactly', 'what', 'Grady', 'does.The', 'dean', 'college', 'Sara', 'Gaskell', 'Francis', 'McDormand', 'who', 'also', 'Professor', 'Tripp', 'girl', 'friend', 'married', 'Dean', 'English', 'Walter', 'Gaskell', 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'clueless', 'boor', 'who', 'Marilyn', 'Munroe', 'Joe', 'DiMaggio', 'Sara', 'truly', 'Tripp', 'yet', 'rudderless', 'ship', 'very', 'centered', 'confident', 'assertive', 'firmly', 'placing', 'emotional', 'ball', 'Tripp', 'court', 'must', 'decide', 'what', 'loose', 'only', 'thing', 'still', 'enjoy', 'post', 'depression', 'might', 'imagine', 'when', 'interesting', 'people', 'are', 'thrown', 'mix', 'murdered', 'dog', 'stolen', 'memorabilia', 'enormous', 'novel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'ending', 'determined', 'ex-jockey', 'car', 'thief', 'possibly', 'named', 'Vernon', 'nobody', 'can', 'predict', 'result', 'only', 'certainty', 'will', 'make', 'interesting', 'ride', 'Director', 'Chris', 'Hanson', 'characters', 'are', 'disparate', 'yet', 'similar', 'certain', 'ways', ""'re"", 'mucking', 'around', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'lives', 'just', 'are', 'only', ""'re"", 'more', 'amusing', 'way']",N/A

We also have a party,a party of writers and nicely done conversations briefly on a writers life and a series of suicides,the link between creation and artistry and suicide, and the orphan son here(orphan as in being abandoned)gives a long series of artists who have succumbed to death,famous and enigmatic deaths like superman icon george reeves to those suffering madness like the once famous gene tierney, and living lonely and isolated lives. Loneliness and isolation are themes here. An image that appears throughout is joe dimaggio and marilyn..its only mr coffee,n,y. joe who really understands and loves marilyn(although they were married less than a year) but his love lasted until the very end,of not only her life but his own,a transcending like experience and hollywood itself was never really good to marilyn in all kinds of ways,even absenting itself from her funeral(ill write more on this when i review a recent book),but n.y. joe appears at her funeral. N.Y. is seen as a center of artistic growth and maturityand probably a source of much good film which is often forgotten,but it is the yankees imaged throughout,and the artists but the civic authorities evidenced are largely absent. The writer leaves his wife and his former wife in a brief scene(woman rarely appear) leaves him to his new found 'young beautiful' mate. Throughout the film in a past reference somewhat anachronistically the characters use the epithets 'jesus,..christ' which is not heard from much here. There is also a brief scene with a tony...and a tuba in a trunk...the oddness of the writer'slife. Throughout the film appears the further development of the murder of the dog,and the civic authorities here concentrated on what's important to the doctor,and there are scenes of the orphan son james addictions(not to mention douglas' addictions)..and the father exhorting addiction like soon youll be munching boxes of cardboard your mind is so addict like...perhaps a reference to upcoming youth. The Douglas character looks with favour to christmas morning,with a show viewed on the 'trick of self development'...a play on the word trick to a more spiritual plain...then the movie ends with the orphan boys book being published 'the love parade' a commentary on themes throughout...and a closing with Wlaton's actor richard thomas chronicolling his new book 'marilyn-joe the last american marriage' since love has lost its permanence in the old institution...and a woman laments on Douglas new book with its geneologies(like jesus geneologies) as being the work of an 'addict.'

522528,ALJUWINH5ZW7S,B00003CXDI,Avery,"[1, 2]","I somewhat enjoyed this movie for the cast.  The story started good, but seemed to fizzle out by the end.  Although the story didn't play well, the interaction between the characters kept the movie going.

What a fantastic cast - and a wonderful study of the characters as the movie slowly moves through a wacky winter weekend at Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh, the site of a writers' conference.Michael Douglas brilliantly portrays Grady, a seedy, pot-smoking professor who published one successful novel 7 years ago and cannot manage to complete a new book (even though he has written over 2,000 pages!). Hia life is further complicated by his affair with the university chancellor and his young wife's abandonment.Toby Maguire (James)plays to perfection the role of a confused student of Douglas'--confused about life and his sexuality--who has written a book but is also a compulsive liar.Robert Downey, Jr. is Douglas' long-suffering agent who shows up for the conference with a transvestite and ends up with James. He plays his part effortlessly.The movie follows James and Grady (in pain from a dog bite) as they drive around the city in Grady's old Fairlaine with a dead dog, a pistol, and a jacket that once belonged to Marilyn Monroe.What I especially liked about this movie is that it did not try to manufacture any false laughs--it is funny without really trying, genuinely funny.

522531,AR37967IAR6ZT,B00003CXDI,Benjamin,"[3, 3]","Curtis Hanson followed his excellent L.A. CONFIDENTIAL with another difficult-to-mount literary adaptation, WONDER BOYS. This film, starring an excellent, shoulda-been-Oscar-nominated Michael Douglas, is based upon Michael Chabon's second novel. Douglas stars as Grady Tripp, a washed-up, perpetually-stoned author and college professor.As the movie opens, Tripp's wife has left him. His girlfriend (who is also his boss' wife) is pregnant, and his oversexed agent is coming to town to see the novel Tripp's not yet finished, though it's over 1,000 pages at this point. Tripp's best writing student is a suicidal depressive, and another of his students, who rents a room in his house, wants to seduce him. Throw into that mix a transvestite with a tuba, a pregnant waitress named Oola, a possibly-stolen car and a dead dog that one of the characters accidentally shot. From that comes the loopy, brilliant plot of this movie.Though some might find Tripp's weekend a bit implausible, people who realize that some writers work best when they're in the middle of real-life chaos will embrace this insightful, well-written film.It's funny and touching. Tobey Maguire makes a great impression here as the impressionable, odd and suicidal student writer James Leer. Katie Holmes carves a terrific niche for herself in one of the film's smaller significant roles. Robert Downey Jr. is particularly terrific as the agent who understands his client's idiosynchracies a bit too well, and Frances McDormand manages to make her long-suffering character sweet and lovable.This is a great movie, particularly if you've ever thought of yourself as something of a writer.",5,Altogether terrific.,1051056000,"04 23, 2003",2003,1655,"['Curtis', 'Hanson', 'followed', 'excellent', 'L.A', 'CONFIDENTIAL', 'difficult-to-mount', 'literary', 'adaptation', 'WONDER', 'BOYS', 'film', 'starring', 'excellent', 'shoulda-been-Oscar-nominated', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'based', 'Michael', 'Chabon', 'second', 'novel', 'Douglas', 'Grady', 'Tripp', 'washed-up', 'perpetually-stoned', 'author', 'college', 'professor.As', 'movie', 'Tripp', 'wife', 'left', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'also', 'boss', 'wife', 'pregnant', 'oversexed', 'agent', 'coming', 'town', 'see', 'novel', 'Tripp', 'not', 'yet', 'finished', '1,000', 'pages', 'point', 'Tripp', 'best', 'writing', 'student', 'suicidal', 'depressive', 'students', 'who', 'room', 'house', 'seduce', 'Throw', 'transvestite', 'tuba', 'pregnant', 'waitress', 'named', 'Oola', 'possibly-stolen', 'car', 'dead', 'dog', 'one', 'characters', 'accidentally', 'shot', 'loopy', 'brilliant', 'plot', 'movie.Though', 'might', 'find', 'Tripp', 'weekend', 'bit', 'implausible', 'people', 'who', 'realize', 'writers', 'work', 'best', 'when', ""'re"", 'middle', 'real-life', 'chaos', 'will', 'embrace', 'insightful', 'well-written', 'film.It', 'funny', 'touching', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'great', 'impression', 'here', 'impressionable', 'odd', 'suicidal', 'student', 'writer', 'James', 'Leer', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'terrific', 'niche', 'herself', 'one', 'film', 'smaller', 'significant', 'roles', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'particularly', 'terrific', 'agent', 'who', 'client', 'idiosynchracies', 'bit', 'too', 'well', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'make', 'long-suffering', 'character', 'sweet', 'lovable.This', 'great', 'movie', 'particularly', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'thought', 'something', 'writer']",N/A

His star student has written a novel about the teacher and his foibles and is an expert on the unnatural deaths of movie and television stars.  The English teacher who is host of the yearly meeting has a fur-collared jacket which Marilyn Monroe had worn one time for one of her marriages.  It is confiscated along with a big car by someone pretending to be James Brown at the party.  It was a complicated and acrimonious affair in that awful winter weather, really bad -- rain, sleet, snow on the ground all at the same time.There near the meeting hall was a large statue of Mary (mother of Jesus) looking down as she holds the babe.  I saw a similar statue at a Methodist church in Nashville of Christ; when you kneel and look up (as I did) you look right into his eyes.  It was eerie and moving all at the same time.  At Sewanee, we had Church Women United sessions with the marvelous peacocks honking at you, but no Jesus statue in existence.

The professor typed faster than my electric word-processor typewriter, and that's saying something.

Katy Holmes is in this flick and learned first hand what can happen when even someone as young (looks about sixteen) as she gets involved and finds herself in trouble after being under the influence.  She is yet to be repented officially.The same kind of trouble the English teacher's wife is with the writing professor who feels that he lost everything he thought was important; now, however, he has someone to help him to get there -- in fact, two someones.

Though well acted by Michael Douglas, Robert Downey Jr., and Tobey Maguire, the story itself is fairly pointless.  The first hour in particular, drags by and as a viewer you are not sure where, if anywhere, the movie is going.  In the second hour, the direction becomes more clear, but it is still rather hard to care because the characters are so off-putting.  Maguire's character, as the young eccentric writer, is annoyingly obtuse and never becomes well defined.  Downey's character, the flamboyant gay publisher's representative adds an element of fun, but at the end the movie cheats by having him enact a too tidy resolution that seems impossible given that he cofesses to Douglas earlier that his employer is about to fire him.  And Douglas's character, allegedly an English professor and one time successful novelist, just drifts through the movie until an ending that causes him to make a major change in his life without any kind of cathartic experience to trigger it.  The part about his 2600 page novel is completely unconvincing.A couple of other minor characters, like Katie Holmes as another of Douglas's students and Rip Torn as a bestselling novelist add exactly nothing to the story.  The biggest problem is that the movie mistakes cleverness for humor and in the end manages to outsmart itself.  For a movie allegedly about fiction writers and their attempts to tell a great story, it remarkably falls well short of doing so.  I also spotted at least one major continuity error as the weather changes from strong rainstorm to perfectly clear in two outdoor scenes meant to be only a few minutes apart.

522539,A3E7ZFQNJ47XB7,B00003CXDI,Brooser Bear,"[1, 4]","This is definitely a poor adaptation of whatever novel this film is based on. You don't have to have read the book to know that stuff has been lost in the screenplay adaptation when characters we know nothing about waltz on the stage and make references to events that weren't even mentioned in film. From what I have gathered of the book the film is based on, the novel is about current and has been geniuses in the literary world. The film, on the other hand, is a self-indulging piece about the glamor of writing. There is a famous refrain about aspiring authors not wanting to actually write, but having written. Meaning that most people do not actually want to labor on a manuscript, rather they would like to bask in the money and the glory of having written a bestseller and struck it big.The film capitalizes exactly on that. None of the late and future literary greats are actually working or agonizing or failing, instead they play with each others' manuscripts and reap the accolades. I haven't read the book and so I am not sure how accurately the novel treats the subject of writing, but the film is set in an idealized world, where creative writing students are not wasting their lives working on copycat pop cliches that will never be published and an aging pothead of a professor is being chased by a nubile young genius rather than vice versa. In real life, professors tend to push their neuroses and other forms of madness on their students, in this cinematic wonder, the students are as mature as professor and all are equally able to objectively view their creative labors. What merit the book might have had is lost in this film that takes itself way too seriouslyto be a comedy that it's meant. The film takes no artistic risks or explores no genuine issues other than making an obligatory bow to political correctness by making a couple of characters gay and giving Eddie Izzard a cameo appearance.Perhaps one of the reasons that this film is so horrible is that it is a mainstream Hollywood product trying to represent the avant-garde while making it so innocuous that it won'tg offend anyone. Small irony, that this screenplay, probably written by professional studio screeqriters is a slap in the face to anybody who has ever struggled to write or faced a 100% rejection rate. The portrayal of a man who has everything and suffers from a writers block while churning out a 3000 page novel is a self indulgent fantasy not unlike gangsta rap. There are no real issues facing troubled writers; not economic hardships, not peer pressure, instead we have a comfortable rich boy genius whose only problem is that his stiff upper lip parents don't give him enough love and understanding. The professor, who suppsedly loses everything in the end, loses nothing, gets a girl of his dreams and continues in his fairy tale existance. This is the ultimate of the film's commercialism since the picture was being touted as a film about a mid-life crisis. If the film is about writing, then it hasn't got an ounce of reality in it. The twists and plots and conflicts that make the dramatic tension in this film are so contrived and sophomoric, that you have to wonder if the whole thing wasn't written by a creative writing class as a term project. The issues and conflicts raised by the film are so innocuous, it would have been allowed to be screened in Maoist China. The film's only saving grace that I give it three (!!!) stars is that the actors manage to portray cool and engaging people despite the mediocrity of the script and the ridiculousness of the scenes they have to act out one can only wonder how they kept a straight face.",3,POOR ADAPTATION OF A GOOD BOOK,1000857600,"09 19, 2001",2001,3651,"['definitely', 'poor', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'film', 'based', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'know', 'stuff', 'been', 'lost', 'screenplay', 'adaptation', 'when', 'characters', 'know', 'nothing', 'waltz', 'stage', 'make', 'references', 'events', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'mentioned', 'film', 'what', 'have', 'gathered', 'book', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'current', 'been', 'geniuses', 'literary', 'world', 'film', 'other', 'hand', 'self-indulging', 'piece', 'glamor', 'writing', 'famous', 'refrain', 'aspiring', 'authors', 'not', 'wanting', 'actually', 'write', 'having', 'written', 'Meaning', 'most', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'actually', 'want', 'labor', 'manuscript', 'rather', 'would', 'like', 'bask', 'money', 'glory', 'having', 'written', 'bestseller', 'struck', 'film', 'capitalizes', 'exactly', 'None', 'late', 'future', 'literary', 'greats', 'are', 'actually', 'working', 'agonizing', 'failing', 'instead', 'play', 'others', 'manuscripts', 'reap', 'accolades', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'so', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'accurately', 'novel', 'subject', 'writing', 'film', 'set', 'idealized', 'world', 'where', 'creative', 'writing', 'students', 'are', 'not', 'wasting', 'lives', 'working', 'copycat', 'pop', 'cliches', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'published', 'aging', 'pothead', 'professor', 'being', 'chased', 'nubile', 'young', 'genius', 'rather', 'vice', 'versa', 'real', 'life', 'professors', 'tend', 'push', 'neuroses', 'other', 'forms', 'madness', 'students', 'cinematic', 'wonder', 'students', 'are', 'as', 'mature', 'professor', 'are', 'equally', 'able', 'objectively', 'view', 'creative', 'labors', 'What', 'merit', 'book', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'lost', 'film', 'way', 'too', 'seriouslyto', 'be', 'comedy', 'meant', 'film', 'artistic', 'risks', 'genuine', 'issues', 'other', 'making', 'obligatory', 'bow', 'political', 'correctness', 'making', 'couple', 'characters', 'gay', 'giving', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'cameo', 'one', 'reasons', 'film', 'so', 'horrible', 'mainstream', 'Hollywood', 'product', 'trying', 'represent', 'avant-garde', 'making', 'so', 'innocuous', ""won'tg"", 'offend', 'anyone', 'Small', 'irony', 'screenplay', 'probably', 'written', 'professional', 'studio', 'screeqriters', 'slap', 'face', 'anybody', 'who', 'ever', 'struggled', 'write', 'faced', '100', '%', 'rejection', 'rate', 'portrayal', 'man', 'who', 'everything', 'suffers', 'writers', 'block', 'churning', 'out', '3000', 'page', 'novel', 'self', 'indulgent', 'fantasy', 'not', 'gangsta', 'rap', 'are', 'real', 'issues', 'facing', 'troubled', 'writers', 'not', 'economic', 'hardships', 'not', 'peer', 'pressure', 'instead', 'have', 'comfortable', 'rich', 'boy', 'genius', 'only', 'problem', 'stiff', 'upper', 'lip', 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'enough', 'love', 'understanding', 'professor', 'who', 'suppsedly', 'everything', 'end', 'nothing', 'girl', 'dreams', 'fairy', 'tale', 'existance', 'ultimate', 'film', 'commercialism', 'picture', 'was', 'being', 'touted', 'film', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'film', 'writing', 'then', ""n't"", 'got', 'ounce', 'reality', 'twists', 'plots', 'conflicts', 'make', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'contrived', 'sophomoric', 'have', 'wonder', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', ""n't"", 'written', 'creative', 'writing', 'class', 'term', 'project', 'issues', 'conflicts', 'raised', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'innocuous', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'allowed', 'be', 'screened', 'Maoist', 'China', 'film', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'give', 'three', 'actors', 'manage', 'portray', 'cool', 'engaging', 'people', 'mediocrity', 'script', 'ridiculousness', 'scenes', 'have', 'act', 'out', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'how', 'kept', 'straight', 'face']",N/A

He does a very able job playing Grady Tripp, a creative writing instructor at a college despite his not having produced a second novel after his glittering first novel of seven years ago.  Set over a weekend, this is a comic look at everything that goes comicly wrong in Tripp's (Douglas's) life, from the women in it to the students to his literary agent and beyond.  I LOL when I saw him working on his 2,000 page book manuscript that he typed on a typewriter, for God's sake!  The fate of this manuscript during the course of this movie is pretty comedic in and of itself.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and stuck right with it.  However, I notice that a few other Amazon reviewers mention that they thought it was slow.  I didn't have that problem with it but I did notice that hubby dozed off a time or two during it.  This is not gripping, hard hitting material by any means and it is possible that others may find it slow as well.

522541,A3OUNPPWYVAWIH,B00003CXDI,Chris Maverick,"[8, 8]","I always try very hard not to compare movies to books that they might be based on. I always feel that a film should sink or swim on its own, so to speak. They should be judged as an independent piece of art, because in actuality, that's what they are. After all, every piece of art is going to be based on some experience by the artist. So what if the work is based on another piece of art. That said, the moment that the credits rolled in this film, I felt that I had no choice but to read the book.That's actually meant to be a compliment. A lot of people will say about a movie &quot;you should read the book.&quot; And by that, they mean, &quot;the book is better.&quot; That's not why I wanted to read the book. I was so moved by the film that I wanted an opportunity to totally immerse myself in the world in which it took place. I ordered the book from Amazon the next morning and have only just begun to read it. I can only hope that it will move me as well as the film did. Given the depth of the talents of its Pulitzer Prize winning author, Michael Chabon, I don't expect that I will be disappointed. I will likely write a review of it as well, but I wanted an opportunity to review the film as a piece unto itself first without hampering my opinions based additional knowledge from the book.What really struck me was how real the film was. At least from my point of view. I felt as though I knew those people. I felt as though I lived that life. Part of that may be due to the fact that I did live that life (I graduated with an English degree from Carnegie Mellon University, where this movie was filmed), but I think a lot of it was also due to honesty with which these characters were portrayed. From Katie Holmes's Hannah, the mysterious cute girl in the class with an obvious crush on the professor to the Michael Douglas's Grady, mildly successful, more of a writer than a teacher with a fine eye for detail that will zone in on a single aspect to sum up the entire character and personality of a real life individual (like her feet).This film is beautiful. I mean it simply breathtaking. I was enrolled at CMU for six and a half years. As I said before, I have been to each location seen in that film more times than I can count, but I can honestly say that I saw the campus in an entirely new light and I will never be able to look at it the same way again. The scenery makes this picture. I've lived in Pittsburgh for nearly a decade, but whenever anyone asks me where I am from, I have always told them Cleveland (my original hometown). But after seeing what the film crew did here, I am proud to live in Pittsburgh. A little bit of movie magic has turned this burned out steel city into a thing of beauty. And I mean movie magic. The movie was actually filmed during an uncharacteristically warm winter. Almost all the snow in the film is fake. It was astounding to see the crew pumping fake snow out all over the place during filming, but it comes across wonderfully realistic in the film.I recommend this film to anyone and everyone. I watch a lot of movies, and I can usually find something nice to say about almost all of them. But it is very seldom that I see a film that touches me in the same way that this one did (the most recent before this was American Beauty). I especially recommend this film to anyone who is familiar with Pittsburgh; the creative writing process or who has at some point found themselves at a difficult crossroads in life. In short, I recommend the movie to anyone like me. But the thing is, I recommend this movie to anyone who isn't like me. Go see this film. You'll be glad you did. And if by any chance you are anything like me, then perhaps you will find a bit of yourself in this film. Perhaps you will find out that you're a Wonder Boy as well.",5,I was a teen-aged Wonder Boy.,989798400,"05 14, 2001",2001,3806,"['always', 'try', 'very', 'hard', 'not', 'compare', 'movies', 'books', 'might', 'be', 'based', 'always', 'feel', 'film', 'should', 'sink', 'swim', 'own', 'so', 'speak', 'should', 'be', 'judged', 'independent', 'piece', 'art', 'actuality', 'what', 'are', 'piece', 'art', 'going', 'be', 'based', 'experience', 'artist', 'So', 'what', 'work', 'based', 'piece', 'art', 'said', 'moment', 'credits', 'rolled', 'film', 'felt', 'had', 'choice', 'read', 'book.That', 'actually', 'meant', 'be', 'compliment', 'lot', 'people', 'will', 'say', 'movie', 'quot', 'should', 'read', 'book.', 'quot', 'mean', 'quot', 'book', 'better.', 'quot', 'not', 'why', 'wanted', 'read', 'book', 'was', 'so', 'moved', 'film', 'wanted', 'opportunity', 'totally', 'immerse', 'world', 'took', 'place', 'ordered', 'book', 'Amazon', 'next', 'morning', 'have', 'only', 'just', 'begun', 'read', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'will', 'move', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'did', 'Given', 'depth', 'talents', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winning', 'author', 'Michael', 'Chabon', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'will', 'likely', 'write', 'review', 'as', 'well', 'wanted', 'opportunity', 'review', 'film', 'piece', 'first', 'hampering', 'opinions', 'based', 'additional', 'knowledge', 'book.What', 'really', 'struck', 'was', 'how', 'real', 'film', 'was', 'least', 'point', 'view', 'felt', 'knew', 'people', 'felt', 'lived', 'life', 'Part', 'may', 'be', 'due', 'fact', 'did', 'live', 'life', 'graduated', 'English', 'degree', 'Carnegie', 'Mellon', 'University', 'where', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'think', 'lot', 'was', 'also', 'due', 'honesty', 'characters', 'were', 'portrayed', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Hannah', 'mysterious', 'cute', 'girl', 'class', 'obvious', 'crush', 'professor', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Grady', 'mildly', 'successful', 'more', 'writer', 'teacher', 'fine', 'eye', 'detail', 'will', 'zone', 'single', 'aspect', 'sum', 'up', 'entire', 'character', 'personality', 'real', 'life', 'individual', 'feet', '.This', 'film', 'beautiful', 'mean', 'simply', 'breathtaking', 'was', 'enrolled', 'CMU', 'six', 'half', 'years', 'said', 'have', 'been', 'location', 'seen', 'film', 'more', 'times', 'can', 'count', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'saw', 'campus', 'entirely', 'new', 'light', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'look', 'same', 'way', 'again', 'scenery', 'picture', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'Pittsburgh', 'nearly', 'decade', 'whenever', 'anyone', 'where', 'am', 'have', 'always', 'told', 'Cleveland', 'original', 'hometown', 'seeing', 'what', 'film', 'crew', 'did', 'here', 'am', 'proud', 'live', 'Pittsburgh', 'little', 'bit', 'movie', 'magic', 'turned', 'burned', 'out', 'steel', 'city', 'thing', 'beauty', 'mean', 'movie', 'magic', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed', 'uncharacteristically', 'warm', 'winter', 'snow', 'film', 'fake', 'was', 'astounding', 'see', 'crew', 'pumping', 'fake', 'snow', 'place', 'filming', 'wonderfully', 'realistic', 'film.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'watch', 'lot', 'movies', 'can', 'usually', 'find', 'something', 'nice', 'say', 'almost', 'very', 'seldom', 'see', 'film', 'same', 'way', 'one', 'did', 'most', 'recent', 'was', 'American', 'Beauty', 'especially', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'familiar', 'Pittsburgh', 'creative', 'writing', 'process', 'who', 'point', 'found', 'difficult', 'crossroads', 'life', 'short', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'thing', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'Go', 'see', 'film', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'did', 'chance', 'are', 'anything', 'then', 'perhaps', 'will', 'find', 'bit', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'will', 'find', 'out', ""'re"", 'Wonder', 'Boy', 'as', 'well']",N/A

Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[19, 21]","'Wonder Boys' a term ocassionally used to describe first time, usually young authors who write great books and often have trouble duplicating the success, is a flawed film which completely won me over because of some perfectly realized moments, good ensemble acting and a stand-out Robert Downey Jr. performance.The film which was attrociously marketed as a cute Michael Douglas comedy,and just recently enjoyed a limited re-release with little notice.  Pity, because it is one of the best films of the year.Female characters get short shrift in this essentially two character study about an over-the-hill anxiety ridden, pot smoking 50 year old College professor and a strange, almost withdrawn young student author.There are several true to life moments that are perfectly captured on film that utterly and completely won me over.  The almost fairy-tale like ending, and some minor but annoying inacuracies are minor flaws the film easily overcomes.  The film contains a couple of beautifully realized scenes which I will treasure for a long long time.  There's also a very impressive soundtrack which is used quite admirably during the film.  A Neil Young Classic punctuates a scene obviously but so perfectly, I wanted to just stand up and go...  Yes, that's the way to do it.Michael Douglas, and Tobey Maguire are the leads, but Robert Downey Jr. as Douglas' (Grady's) Agent is superb in another go-for-broke, swing for the bleachers performance. It may be his best performance ever (and he's given some incredible ones in the past).The film is a laid back, casually-paced character study. It's not an action film or a dumb comedy but a film that takes its time and gets most of its details right. It's a film about inner conflicts, relationhships, self doubt and relationships that usually feels authentic and true.  A few details seem maddeningly wrong, but they are minor and one of my nit-picks --regarding Grady-a professional writer single spacing his manuscript which is a real tabu of editors)--is actually how the writer of the novel and his wife have submitted material to editors in rea life supposedly without dire consequences.Hopefully you'll get the opportunity to view the film without knowing too much about the films minor twists and turns.It's easy to see why Curtis Hanson was attracted to this story about creative types questioning their abilities and confidence to continue in their chosen field.  Hanson leap frogged from a reputation as a competent border-line hack director of such better than average thrillers as The Bedroom Window, Bad Influence ,The Hand that Rocks the Cradle and The River Wild into a first class skilled a-list director with 1997's L.A.  Confidential.For his follow-up Hanson chose a quieter, more introspective and even riskier film;  The Wonder Boys.It's far from perfect but I suspect it will easily make my 10 best of 2000.Chris Jarmick Author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

522545,AQVBOVE8P7K3J,B00003CXDI,Condor Libros,"[0, 0]","A real overlooked gem of a dramedy that features one of Michael Douglas best, most refreshing performances. Instead of playing yet another in his long (and increasingly tired) line of angry, bitter, often wealthy white males, Douglas here plays an often bemused, occasionally baffled, frequently stoned college professor going through a funny variation of the mid-life crisis.The film follows his (mis)adventures over a narrow period of time as he vainly struggles to finish a mammoth novel. Eccentric characters and hijinks ensue.

Waldman ""Film Guru""","[6, 6]","If you want to find a good movie released in the year 2000, find one made on a small budget with little to no advertising.  A movie that will open and close before the ink of the critic's reviews has even dried.  Wonder Boys was the most mature, the least predictable, and the most entertaining grown-up American movie made last year.  The story follows Tenured creative writing Professor Grady Tripp through an outrageous, hectic weekend 7 years after the publication of a highly successful novel.  His young wife has just left him, he is having an affair with his boss's wife, smokes marijuana, has one ultra-gifted, possibly suicidal young man in his class, and has a sultry young student boarding in his home who seems very willing to take the place of his wife.  In addition to this, his agent comes to town wanting to see his long-delayed sophomore novel, his boss's wife just found out she's pregnant, and there's a strange man insisting that Grady Tripp stole his car.I guess the marketing department, when they looked at this film, had no idea on how to sell it.  It has no special effects.  No really big waves or gladiators.  It doesn't have lots of music video style shots of cars getting stolen or attractive young women in skimpy outfits dancing on a bar.  Instead of all that vacuous eye candy, this movie offers up three dimensional characters with true to life dialogue.But then again, they managed to promote American Beauty well enough.  And this movie, while also being about a man in a mid-life crisis, is in many ways better.  This was probably the only American made movie that should have been considered for best picture last year.",5,Wonderful Wonder Boys,992390400,"06 13, 2001",2001,1656,"['want', 'find', 'good', 'movie', 'released', 'year', '2000', 'find', 'one', 'made', 'small', 'budget', 'little', 'advertising', 'movie', 'will', 'open', 'close', 'ink', 'critic', 'reviews', 'even', 'dried', 'Wonder', 'Boys', 'was', 'most', 'mature', 'least', 'predictable', 'most', 'entertaining', 'grown-up', 'American', 'movie', 'made', 'last', 'year', 'story', 'Tenured', 'creative', 'writing', 'Professor', 'Grady', 'Tripp', 'outrageous', 'hectic', 'weekend', '7', 'years', 'publication', 'highly', 'successful', 'novel', 'young', 'wife', 'just', 'left', 'having', 'affair', 'boss', 'wife', 'smokes', 'marijuana', 'one', 'ultra-gifted', 'possibly', 'suicidal', 'young', 'man', 'class', 'sultry', 'young', 'student', 'boarding', 'home', 'who', 'very', 'willing', 'take', 'place', 'wife', 'addition', 'agent', 'town', 'wanting', 'see', 'long-delayed', 'sophomore', 'novel', 'boss', 'wife', 'just', 'found', 'out', 'pregnant', 'strange', 'man', 'insisting', 'Grady', 'Tripp', 'stole', 'car.I', 'guess', 'marketing', 'department', 'when', 'looked', 'film', 'had', 'idea', 'how', 'sell', 'special', 'effects', 'really', 'big', 'waves', 'gladiators', ""n't"", 'have', 'lots', 'music', 'video', 'style', 'shots', 'cars', 'getting', 'stolen', 'attractive', 'young', 'women', 'skimpy', 'outfits', 'dancing', 'bar', 'Instead', 'vacuous', 'eye', 'candy', 'movie', 'up', 'three', 'dimensional', 'characters', 'true', 'life', 'dialogue.But', 'then', 'again', 'managed', 'promote', 'American', 'Beauty', 'well', 'enough', 'movie', 'also', 'being', 'man', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'many', 'ways', 'better', 'was', 'probably', 'only', 'American', 'made', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'best', 'picture', 'last', 'year']",N/A
522548,A3KOVFORKXQ2U9,B00003CXDI,Daniel McInnis,"[1, 1]","Wonder Boys is a relatively uneventful picture yet somehow at the film's conclusion it's lead characters (and even a few of the secondary ones too) have arched, changing their lives forever.  If I had to describe it in one word it would be &quot;subtle.&quot;  Maybe a little too subtle for audiences stateside who despite rave reviews from critics, basically panned the movie with a domestic box office take in the high teens.  This from a movie that boasts L.A. Confidential director Curtis Hanson, megastar Michael Douglas and a winning soundtrack of classic songs that includes an original number by Bob Dylan, which also happens to be possibly the best song written for a film, ever!Douglas stars in one of his most unglamorous roles to date as Grady Tripp.  He's an aging professor and acclaimed author who after seven years has yet to complete his much anticipated follow-up to his award-winning debut novel, Arsonists Daughter.  He's encountering a form of writers block that rather than disallowing him to write, won't let him stop.  His new book is now well over two thousand pages and as he puts it, &quot;The ending seems to keep getting further away.&quot;  His personal life is equally muddled.  He's in love with the boss' wife (Frances McDormand) who also happens to be the chancellor of the university, going on his second divorce and finds himself involved with a student (Maguire) who triggers feelings of unfulfilled promise in him.James (Maguire), seeming particularly depressed one night, reaches out to Grady and the two embark on a journey of self-discovery that's as much a coming-of-age tale for this fifty-something professor as it is his student, thirty years his junior.  This is a recurring message in the movie, that it's never too late to rediscover yourself.  Their misadventures begin on the opening night of the university's annual gala Word Fest.  Grady's publisher (Robert Downey, Jr.) is in town to swipe a peek at this long overdue novel, one of his most fetching students (Toledo's own Katie Holmes) is making advances, and with his marriage already on the rocks his girlfriend announces to him that she's pregnant.These are extraordinary events that unfold in a very realistic, true-to-life way which is what makes them so easy to relate to.  It's not a film about overnight reformation but the simple intricacies of life and the gradual changes we encounter along the way.  For Grady the transitions have been so refined that even he doesn't realize how far he's fallen from the person he aspired to become.  Expectations have dampened his spirit and he's become so afraid of making a mistake that he refuses to make choices as to which way he wants to steer his life in.  At this point he's just wandering through life without any real sense of purpose.  This is beautifully expressed in Dylan's song, &quot;Things Have Changed.&quot;  In this five minute anthem he manages to capture the essence of the picture and nail it down to such an extent that it's almost as telling as the film itself.You see, the music is all a part of the story-telling process.  Bob Dylan, Van Morrison and Neil Young almost have as great of claims to writing credits as Oscar nominated scribe Steve Kloves.  This is essential because it brings in people from all walks of life.  As Douglas sits in his broken down car, smoking a joint, reading James' manuscript with Neil Young belting out &quot;Old Man,&quot; we understand the significance of the moment without him ever having to say a word.If I have any complaints about the movie it would have to be that the ending is a little too neat for my taste.  But that doesn't deter from my appreciation of this wonderful film that may have been lost on some but wasn't on me, and hopefully won't be on you either.",4,This  Is  Wonderful  Film-Making,987552000,"04 18, 2001",2001,3784,"['Wonder', 'Boys', 'relatively', 'uneventful', 'picture', 'yet', 'somehow', 'film', 'conclusion', 'lead', 'characters', 'even', 'few', 'secondary', 'ones', 'too', 'have', 'arched', 'changing', 'lives', 'forever', 'had', 'describe', 'one', 'word', 'would', 'be', 'quot', 'subtle.', 'quot', 'Maybe', 'little', 'too', 'subtle', 'audiences', 'stateside', 'who', 'rave', 'reviews', 'critics', 'basically', 'panned', 'movie', 'domestic', 'box', 'office', 'take', 'high', 'teens', 'movie', 'L.A', 'Confidential', 'director', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'megastar', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'winning', 'soundtrack', 'classic', 'songs', 'original', 'number', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'also', 'be', 'possibly', 'best', 'song', 'written', 'film', 'ever', 'Douglas', 'one', 'most', 'unglamorous', 'roles', 'date', 'Grady', 'Tripp', 'aging', 'professor', 'acclaimed', 'author', 'who', 'seven', 'years', 'yet', 'complete', 'much', 'anticipated', 'follow-up', 'award-winning', 'debut', 'novel', 'Daughter', 'encountering', 'form', 'writers', 'block', 'rather', 'disallowing', 'write', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'new', 'book', 'now', 'well', 'two', 'thousand', 'pages', 'quot', 'ending', 'keep', 'getting', 'further', 'away.', 'quot', 'personal', 'life', 'equally', 'muddled', 'love', 'boss', 'wife', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'chancellor', 'university', 'going', 'second', 'divorce', 'involved', 'student', 'Maguire', 'who', 'feelings', 'unfulfilled', 'promise', 'him.James', 'Maguire', 'seeming', 'particularly', 'depressed', 'one', 'night', 'out', 'Grady', 'two', 'embark', 'journey', 'self-discovery', 'as', 'much', 'coming-of-age', 'tale', 'fifty-something', 'professor', 'student', 'thirty', 'years', 'junior', 'recurring', 'message', 'movie', 'never', 'too', 'late', 'rediscover', 'misadventures', 'begin', 'opening', 'night', 'university', 'annual', 'gala', 'Word', 'Fest', 'Grady', 'publisher', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'town', 'swipe', 'peek', 'long', 'overdue', 'novel', 'one', 'most', 'fetching', 'students', 'Toledo', 'own', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'making', 'advances', 'marriage', 'already', 'rocks', 'girlfriend', 'announces', 'pregnant.These', 'are', 'extraordinary', 'events', 'unfold', 'very', 'realistic', 'true-to-life', 'way', 'what', 'so', 'easy', 'relate', 'not', 'film', 'overnight', 'reformation', 'simple', 'intricacies', 'life', 'gradual', 'changes', 'encounter', 'way', 'Grady', 'transitions', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'refined', 'even', ""n't"", 'realize', 'how', 'far', 'fallen', 'person', 'aspired', 'become', 'Expectations', 'have', 'dampened', 'spirit', 'become', 'so', 'afraid', 'making', 'mistake', 'make', 'choices', 'way', 'steer', 'life', 'point', 'just', 'wandering', 'life', 'real', 'sense', 'purpose', 'beautifully', 'expressed', 'Dylan', 'song', 'quot', 'Things', 'Have', 'Changed.', 'quot', 'five', 'minute', 'anthem', 'capture', 'essence', 'picture', 'nail', 'down', 'such', 'extent', 'almost', 'as', 'telling', 'film', 'itself.You', 'see', 'music', 'part', 'story-telling', 'process', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Van', 'Morrison', 'Neil', 'Young', 'almost', 'have', 'great', 'claims', 'writing', 'credits', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'scribe', 'Steve', 'Kloves', 'essential', 'people', 'walks', 'life', 'Douglas', 'broken', 'down', 'car', 'smoking', 'joint', 'reading', 'James', 'manuscript', 'Neil', 'Young', 'belting', 'out', 'quot', 'Old', 'Man', 'quot', 'understand', 'significance', 'moment', 'ever', 'having', 'say', 'word.If', 'have', 'complaints', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'ending', 'little', 'too', 'neat', 'taste', ""n't"", 'deter', 'appreciation', 'wonderful', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'was', ""n't"", 'hopefully', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be']",N/A

Curtis Hanson will never miss an occasion to remind us of Michal Douglas's painful leg as long as the dream isn't over.No, the problem lies elsewhere. In fact, WONDER BOYS misses the mark simply because you don't care about the characters.

'Wonder Boys' is a wonderfully skewed comedy, with characters who zig and zag across the screen, weaving in through each others lives, and ultimately finding salvation in each other. Michael Douglas gives his second-great performance of 2000 (the other being in 'Traffic') as Professor Grady Tripp, a chronic pot-smoking, english teacher/author who has had great success in the past with his first novel. Problem is, he can't seem to finish his follow-up and he's been trying for years. He is having an affair with a married chancellor at his school (Frances McDormand in HER sceond great performance of the year, the other being in 'Almost Famous'). His barely-in-the-closet editor (the incredible Robert Downey Jr.) is breathing down his throat and a student of his (Katie Holmes) is trying to get in his pants. Not only that he has the chancellor's dead dog in his trunk, thanks to a mishap with a bewildered, mysterious student of his (Tobey Maguire at his usual excellence) and the car he's driving may or may not be stolen. Over the course of one hellish weekend, Grady Tripp will find out what it means to be in charge of one's own life and the way making a simple choice can change things for the better. The movie rides smoothly from start to finish thanks to great, assured direction by Hanson and smooth screenwriting by Steve Kloves (from the novel by Michael Chabon). It's a truly amazing film, whose character's are so well developed and layered that we never know what to expect of them at any given moment. In fact, anywhere you think this movie might be going at any given time, you will more then likely be wrong. It's surprising and heart-felt, as funny as it is involving, as moving as it is intelligent. And you won't find a better performance then Douglas's in any film this year. It's a true stand-out role for him, a break from his normal obsessive, hard-headed monsters. And he is brilliant. And so is Tobey Maguire, who continues to dazzle with every film.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[6, 6]","Let's face it:  Writers are oddball, quirky, mega-eccentric creatures, yet this delightful comedy takes writers--and writing--to a whole new dysfunctional dimension.  WONDER BOYS tells the story of how a handful of extremely interesting characters must suddenly make some very formidable decisions--all over the course of one breathless weekend.Michael Douglas carries this movie most admirably as laid-back, pot-smoking Professor Grady Tripp.  Even being tenured can't take away from the fact his third wife has left him, he's knocked up the college chancellor (Frances McDormand is admirable, too), he's stolen a car (and a priceless Marilyn Monroe collectible), hidden his star pupil from the authorities, and is desperately trying to keep his crazed editor away from his second novel--a novel he can't, after more than 2600 pages, find a way to finish.  Intriguing developments, to be sure, but beyond all the madness and mayhem Professor Tripp finally finds himself at a crossroads; he's never had to make tough decisions before, but as the weekend ends, some serious life-changing choices come a'calling.This is a cast that works together magnificently.  Tobey MaGuire as troubled, brooding student James Leer is so deadpan I didn't know whether to offer him a helping hand. . .or run for my life.  Robert Downey Jr., as impassioned, zany editor Crabtree, essentially plays himself.  And young Katie Holmes is irresistibly snuggable.  But the real star of this film is screenwriter Steve Kloves; after all, if you're going to have a story about writers, and writing, you'd best have a script that makes all the characters, despite all that's happening to them, compelling and believable.  And Kloves sure pulls it off, in spades.WONDER BOYS, set in blustery, damp, rainy Pittsburgh, is great fun.  It's darn time a movie about writers was funny, instead of dark and morbid.  After all, writers are a barrel of laughs; I've got a two thousand-page novel to prove it.--D.

Movahedpour ""doeadear""","[0, 0]","This film did not do great box office business, and it did receive a few reluctant Oscar nods, which is a waste, since it is certainly one of the best films I have seen on the creative process, fate, and life's more complicated decisions.Michael Douglas gives one of his best performances in years as Grady Tripp, an English professor and published novelist, who has been writing his follow-up for seven years. In the meantime, his latest trophy wife has left him, and he has been having an affair for years with Sara Gaskell, very well-played by Frances McDormand, who happens to be married to the English Department's Dean.Enter James Leer, a very witty name for the character very well played by Tobey Maguire. James does, indeed, leer from the background. He is Grady's best student, a brilliant writer who seems to craft his work with amazing ease. He is also a compulsive liar, and he drags Grady into a crazy set of circumstances and, eventually, revelations.Robert Downey, Jr. does a great comedy turn as Grady's editor, Terry Crabtree, who arrives awaiting the novel that Grady simply cannot stop writing. The book has stretched to thousands of pages, and Grady cannot find a conclusion to his novel or to his life.The direction by Curtis Hanson is understated and superb, and the screenplay, by Steven Kloves adapted from the novel by Michael Chabon, is witty and fast-moving. There are so many good things about this film, and it is a must-see for any frustrated writer. The performances, including a small but memorable part by Rip Torn, are incredibly good, and the chemistry between Douglas and his co-stars McDormand, Maguire and Downey is superb.I cannot recommend this film enough.

The novel, while wonderfully well written, with artful sentences and beautifully stitched paragraphs, lacks suspense. The film, which I saw both in the theater and on DVD, sticks closely to the book and now there's no way one can read Grady Tripp's voice without hearing Michael Douglas, who here out-acts his charming performance as president in The American President. Michael captures Chabon's inflections perfectly. I've come to love this movie and feel that the characters are part of my life. For me, the acting throughout is matchless. Curtis Hanson deserves great credit for not trying to juice up the story. I think this will be one of those addictive movies with locked in pleasures I want to share with all my friends and will sit through ten times without tiring of the subtleties. Probably more than ten times over the years. When you have a can't miss DVD you just have to break it out for friends who haven't seen the film. By the way, the Bob Dylan video of the his Oscar-winning &quot;Things Have Changed&quot; is on the DVD and though I've watched it twice, and heard him sing it during the Academy Awards, and even have read the complete lyrics in Entertainment Weekly, well, it still eludes my ear. Aside from &quot;I'm in love with a women who don't even appeal to me,&quot; I just can't get most of the lines. I wish I had saved the trot from EW. Pale and smileless as a clown, Bob no longer sells his lyrics the way he did as a youngster where one might savor every word and Rimbaud image. But then why should he sing the way he did forty years ago?

Its not my typical horror or fantasy movies, its not an action movie either but i wouldn't just tag it as a drama cause there's a lot more than that to it. I think its a really beautiful Film with a bunch of great actors and a very special story line!!This one is about the world of writers and authors. We get to see how this world works and how can a writer be inspired enough to write a good story and what will motivate him and keep him inspired throughout good and bad times. I think this story was written by Michael Chabon, it was adapted from his book ""Wonder Boys"".The story is about Professor Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas), he's a literature teacher who's trying to help his students becoming good writers and authors by helping them understand other people and  other writers of all genre  and how to be inspired by  finding out who they  are exactly as human beings and what keeps them inspired  happy and ready to go forward in life. In his class there is James Leer (Tobey Maguire) and Hannah Green (Katie Holmes) who are both ready to become Authors and very happy to work with Professor Tripp as he's a Legendary writer for both of them. Hannah already have lots of talent but she will soon have to deal with other realities of life as her feelings for Professor Trip will force her to change her behaviour. James (Tobey) is the reject of the class as all his classmate are making fun of him because of his weird and strange behaviour, the stories he writes are also very strange and hard to understand but everyone will soon discover that he really is the best and has a huge potential for being a really good author, with the help of Professor Trip, he will learn how life works and how to connect with himself.The performances by the actors are all awesome: KATIE HOLMES, MICHAEL DOUGLAS, TOBEY MAGUIRE and especially ROBERT DOWNEY JR. The cinematography is just perfect and the soundtrack is amazing. NEIL YOUNG and BOB DYLAN'S songs seem to fit the whole movie extremely well and gives a really beautiful  and magic touch to the movie. Perfect for the holidays!! There is also some very funny moments  in the movie where you will really have a good laugh.....lot's of random things you Won't expect....I would recommend it to anyone who wants to see a good movie and especially anyone who's interested in the world of writers and authors.ENJOY!!!!!",5,**Really Beautiful!! - Best Comedy/Drama  Film Ever Made!!**,1324944000,"12 27, 2011",2011,2443,"['do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'know', 'what', 'movie', 'something', 'magic', 'not', 'typical', 'horror', 'fantasy', 'movies', 'not', 'action', 'movie', 'i', 'would', ""n't"", 'just', 'tag', 'drama', 'cause', 'lot', 'more', 'think', 'really', 'beautiful', 'Film', 'bunch', 'great', 'actors', 'very', 'special', 'story', 'line', 'one', 'world', 'writers', 'authors', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'world', 'how', 'can', 'writer', 'be', 'inspired', 'enough', 'write', 'good', 'story', 'what', 'will', 'motivate', 'keep', 'inspired', 'good', 'bad', 'times', 'think', 'story', 'was', 'written', 'Michael', 'Chabon', 'was', 'adapted', 'book', 'Wonder', 'Boys', '.The', 'story', 'Professor', 'Grady', 'Tripp', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'literature', 'teacher', 'who', 'trying', 'help', 'students', 'becoming', 'good', 'writers', 'authors', 'helping', 'understand', 'other', 'people', 'other', 'writers', 'genre', 'how', 'be', 'inspired', 'finding', 'out', 'who', 'are', 'exactly', 'human', 'beings', 'what', 'inspired', 'happy', 'ready', 'go', 'forward', 'life', 'class', 'James', 'Leer', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Hannah', 'Green', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'who', 'are', 'ready', 'become', 'Authors', 'very', 'happy', 'work', 'Professor', 'Tripp', 'Legendary', 'writer', 'Hannah', 'already', 'have', 'lots', 'talent', 'will', 'soon', 'have', 'deal', 'other', 'realities', 'life', 'feelings', 'Professor', 'Trip', 'will', 'force', 'change', 'behaviour', 'James', 'Tobey', 'reject', 'class', 'classmate', 'are', 'making', 'fun', 'weird', 'strange', 'behaviour', 'stories', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'strange', 'hard', 'understand', 'everyone', 'will', 'soon', 'discover', 'really', 'best', 'huge', 'potential', 'being', 'really', 'good', 'author', 'help', 'Professor', 'Trip', 'will', 'learn', 'how', 'life', 'how', 'connect', 'himself.The', 'performances', 'actors', 'are', 'awesome', 'KATIE', 'HOLMES', 'MICHAEL', 'DOUGLAS', 'TOBEY', 'MAGUIRE', 'especially', 'ROBERT', 'DOWNEY', 'JR', 'cinematography', 'just', 'perfect', 'soundtrack', 'amazing', 'NEIL', 'YOUNG', 'BOB', 'DYLAN', 'songs', 'seem', 'fit', 'whole', 'movie', 'extremely', 'well', 'really', 'beautiful', 'magic', 'touch', 'movie', 'Perfect', 'holidays', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'movie', 'where', 'will', 'really', 'have', 'good', 'laugh', '..lot', 'random', 'things', 'Wo', ""n't"", 'expect', '.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'see', 'good', 'movie', 'especially', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'world', 'writers', 'authors.ENJOY']",N/A

Dolnack,"[4, 4]","I am a native Pittsburgher and have known professors of creative writing at the Universities there, and let me tell you that the makers of ""Wonder Boys"" have captured the real McCoy here perfectly!This is the absolute best performance of Michael Douglas's career in my opinion. He captures the inner-essence of over-the-hill (but in denial about it) Grady Tripp and lets us, the viewer, really crawl around in this character's skin like few other movies I've ever watched, particularly for a comedy film. As I watched this movie, I didn't see Michael Douglas playing a role. Rather, I was watching Grady Tripp and I was involved in his life.This isn't your typical Hollywood movie, nor it is a formulaic comedy either. There are few artificial sets here. The locales are real - I know, I live there. The houses are real, the interiors are real Pittsburgh-style homes, the dreary, slushy rain pouding down on snow-covered lawns is 100% Pittsburgh climate. The bars are truly that dingy and smoky; the streets that narrow and claustrophobic; the skies that gray and overcast.I love that this smart little comedy shows a sophisticated side to the overall Proletariat, working-class city. It's true: Pittsburgh has a very prestigious and vibrant cultural vibe and there are very many truly unique and colorful characters living there, much like Grady Tripp. From my personal experiences, I would have to attest that writer Michael Chabon really is from Pittsburgh or he could have never written such truly genuine Pittsburgh-esque characters. Even though the actors aren't, they sure feel like Pittsburghers to me.There are all kinds of comedies out there. Some smart and others stupid. Smart comedies tend to try a little too hard in my opinion to be smart and end up coming off as smug or arrogant. Woody Allen's comedy films sometimes come off this way. But Wonder Boys walks this fine line carefully and never talks down to the audience. These characters aren't showing off, and the brilliantly subtle screenplay seems so naturalistic that at times you simply forget that you're watching a movie at all.I wish there were many more comedy films being made these days of this level of quality, originality, and intelligence. Sadly, Wonder Boys is a rarity. I cherish it nonetheless and applaud it for walking such a narrow path of perfection.Take it from an educated Pittsburgher - Wonder Boys is the real thing!

I thought it was a very well written screenplay, and I loved Alan Ball's screenplay even better(Beauty).  The main character is played brilliantly by Michael Douglas, and the movie pretty much centers around him.  I don't know if Wonder Boys will sweep the Oscars like Beauty did, but I think it deserves a few nods.-- Best Actor, best screenplay, and best director.  Like American Beauty, I don't think this film is for everybody.  It plays like a drama, but has comedic moments thrown in.  I could rehash what the film is about like everyone else here, but I just want to voice that I think it is an excellent film that I was very entertained by.  It was funny and though not fast paced, was very engrossing.  Not to mention the amazing acting!! This film was a springboard for some of the best acting in the year 2000 -- Robert Downey Jr., Tobey McGuire, and Frances McDormand.

522564,A84UFSF2SZS2W,B00003CXDI,"EriKa ""E""","[7, 8]","What an underrated but spectacular film. I saw it in the cinema when it was originally released. Michael Douglas gives the performance of a lifetime as a burned out, pot smoking English professor who published a book a decade ago, which was met with critical and commercial success, and has been working on the follow up (all 2000+ aimless pages of it) for the ten years since. His wife leaves him, his agent (Robert Downey, Jr.) comes to town, he deals with a suicidal, compulsive liar but brilliant student of his (Tobey Maguire), and he discovers his girlfriend (a fantastic Frances McDormand) is pregnant with his child. She happens to be the chancellor of the university where he teaches. Her husband is the head of the English department in which he works. Douglas as Grady Tripp is amazing as he drifts from one crisis to the next, never quite making decisions and trying to put band-aids on all the problems in his life. The dialogue is intelligent and witty, the acting is superb all around, and although the ending comes and ends neatly, it is still a nearly perfect film. Such a shame more people did not see it.",5,"I'M A LITTLE WORRIED, JAMES...",985564800,"03 26, 2001",2001,1123,"['What', 'underrated', 'spectacular', 'film', 'saw', 'cinema', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'burned', 'out', 'pot', 'smoking', 'English', 'professor', 'who', 'published', 'book', 'decade', 'ago', 'was', 'met', 'critical', 'commercial', 'success', 'been', 'working', 'follow', 'up', '2000+', 'aimless', 'pages', 'ten', 'years', 'wife', 'agent', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'town', 'suicidal', 'compulsive', 'liar', 'brilliant', 'student', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'girlfriend', 'fantastic', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'pregnant', 'child', 'be', 'chancellor', 'university', 'where', 'husband', 'head', 'English', 'department', 'Douglas', 'Grady', 'Tripp', 'amazing', 'one', 'crisis', 'next', 'never', 'quite', 'making', 'decisions', 'trying', 'put', 'band-aids', 'problems', 'life', 'dialogue', 'intelligent', 'witty', 'acting', 'superb', 'ending', 'neatly', 'still', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'film', 'shame', 'more', 'people', 'did', 'not', 'see']",N/A
522565,A3K77198CXHGDE,B00003CXDI,Erix,"[33, 34]","You'd think that &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; was a tough act to follow. But director Curtis Hanson takes it in stride with his follow-up, &quot;Wonder Boys&quot;. An adaptation of Michael Chabon's novel that is pretty far removed from &quot;Confidential&quot;, and yet, manages to be equally compelling and uniquely sedutive on its own.Much of it is probably owed to Michael Douglas. In a refined, carefully controlled performance the actor packs on some 30 pounds and looks totally dishevelled as a burned out college professor with a fondness for marihuana.Douglas' perfect portrayal completely carries the film. It is, in essence, a melancholic comedy. Hanson and the screenwriter use this mood to set-up some very interesting situations and present very unusual characters. The situations are aided by Dante Spinotti's captivating cinematography. And at some instances, things get so bizarre and madcap that you might think you're watching a Coen Brothers movie. Particularly in a very mean-spirited subplot involving the fate of a blind pit bull, and in a wildly amusing scene involving a car accident and Douglas' work in progress. I think of it as psychological slapstick comedy. The thinking man's pie-in-the-face. The story is riddled with stuff like this that borders on the absurd but is presented as matter-of-factly as possible.The whole thing with Douglas' female student played by Katie Holmes, for instance. He rents her a room in his house. She clearly has a deep crush on him. And the irony here is that in a strange way this ends up being a parody of the cinematic sexual escapades that Douglas is known for... In another movie, he might have succumbed to her seductions, but he plays a very different low-key character here. Holmes plays the part perfectly too. After seeing her give such assured performances in off-beat films like this, &quot;The Ice Storm&quot; and the underrated gem &quot;Go&quot;, I find it hard to believe that &quot;Dawson's Creek&quot; is her day job. In some ways she's evry bit as daring and accomplished as her more &quot;prestigious&quot; contemporary Cristina Ricci.But the real choice stuff lies elsewhere. Downey Jr's extremely likable character is a delicious treat to watch. When he develops a crush on Maguire it's actually pretty endearing. I like the tasteful way that this movie handles the &quot;love affair&quot; between Downey and Maguire. Some other movie might have exploited it as a chance to be &quot;daring&quot; and &quot;controversial.&quot; Here, the fact is treated with naturalistic ease. Seeing Maguire and Downey lying in bed together with their shirts off is not geared to raise eyebrows. It's a positive plot point about genuine affection, handled with warmth and jolly humor.And finally, an energetic subplot within a subplot involving a pregnant waittress named Oola (the underused beauty Jane Adams) and a neurotic James Brown lookalike named Vernon (hilariously played by Richard Knox) This entire block of the film feels like vintage Coen. With delightful off-center dialogues and moments of potentially lethal suspense handled with farcical sitcom glee.But, ultimately, the film gets by on its honest human emotions and it's the relationships that are at the heart of the film. The relationship between Douglas and Frances McDormand rings true, all the more aided by McDormand's heartfelt performance. And once Douglas begins to serve as a kind of father figure for Maguire it's even more moving. It could be that Maguire creates a character that projects vulnerability with intelligence. The film has many memorable moments with him at the center. I was eerily mesmerized in a scene where he alphabetically goes through a list of all the Hollywood movie stars that have committed suicide. There is a darkness there but at the same time, the scene has poignancy and it is the foreshadow to a touching scene involving Maguire's fascination with the coat Marilyn Monroe wore on her wedding day.Curtis Hanson has proven himself as a classy filmmaker. Gone are the days of plastic popcorn entertainment like &quot;The Hand that Rocks the Cradle&quot;. With &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; and now this, he has proven to be a meticulous and intelligent filmmaker that is very aware of the nuances of elegant cinematic storytelling and he knows how to work sensibly within the Hollywood system. It's rare to see a mainstream Hollywood film that isn't all that mainstream. &quot;Wonder Boys&quot; is a highly enjoyable and ultimately sober dramatic comedy with intelligence and truth... I even like the questionable fact that it boldly attempts to ultimately be an anti-drug parable. Hanson handles that point so subtly, that you wont feel as patronized as you should.",4,Michael Douglas Gains Weight And Smokes Pot,978739200,"01 6, 2001",2001,4743,"[""'d"", 'think', 'quot', 'L.A.', 'Confidential', 'quot', 'was', 'tough', 'act', 'follow', 'director', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'stride', 'follow-up', 'quot', 'Wonder', 'Boys', 'quot', 'adaptation', 'Michael', 'Chabon', 'novel', 'pretty', 'far', 'removed', 'quot', 'Confidential', 'quot', 'yet', 'be', 'equally', 'compelling', 'uniquely', 'sedutive', 'own.Much', 'probably', 'owed', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'refined', 'carefully', 'controlled', 'performance', 'actor', '30', 'pounds', 'totally', 'dishevelled', 'burned', 'out', 'college', 'professor', 'fondness', 'marihuana.Douglas', 'perfect', 'portrayal', 'completely', 'film', 'essence', 'melancholic', 'comedy', 'Hanson', 'screenwriter', 'use', 'mood', 'set-up', 'very', 'interesting', 'situations', 'present', 'very', 'unusual', 'characters', 'situations', 'are', 'aided', 'Dante', 'Spinotti', 'captivating', 'cinematography', 'instances', 'things', 'get', 'so', 'bizarre', 'madcap', 'might', 'think', ""'re"", 'watching', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'movie', 'Particularly', 'very', 'mean-spirited', 'subplot', 'involving', 'fate', 'blind', 'pit', 'bull', 'wildly', 'amusing', 'scene', 'involving', 'car', 'accident', 'Douglas', 'work', 'progress', 'think', 'psychological', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'thinking', 'man', 'pie-in-the-face', 'story', 'riddled', 'stuff', 'absurd', 'presented', 'as', 'matter-of-factly', 'possible.The', 'whole', 'thing', 'Douglas', 'female', 'student', 'played', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'instance', 'room', 'house', 'clearly', 'deep', 'crush', 'irony', 'here', 'strange', 'way', 'up', 'being', 'parody', 'cinematic', 'sexual', 'escapades', 'Douglas', 'known', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'succumbed', 'seductions', 'very', 'different', 'low-key', 'character', 'here', 'Holmes', 'part', 'perfectly', 'too', 'seeing', 'give', 'such', 'assured', 'performances', 'off-beat', 'films', 'quot', 'Ice', 'Storm', 'quot', 'underrated', 'gem', 'quot', 'Go', 'quot', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'quot', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'quot', 'day', 'job', 'ways', 'evry', 'bit', 'daring', 'accomplished', 'more', 'quot', 'prestigious', 'quot', 'contemporary', 'Cristina', 'Ricci.But', 'real', 'choice', 'stuff', 'elsewhere', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'extremely', 'likable', 'character', 'delicious', 'treat', 'watch', 'When', 'crush', 'Maguire', 'actually', 'pretty', 'endearing', 'tasteful', 'way', 'movie', 'quot', 'affair', 'quot', 'Downey', 'Maguire', 'other', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'exploited', 'chance', 'be', 'quot', 'daring', 'quot', 'quot', 'controversial.', 'quot', 'Here', 'fact', 'treated', 'naturalistic', 'ease', 'Seeing', 'Maguire', 'Downey', 'lying', 'bed', 'together', 'shirts', 'off', 'not', 'geared', 'raise', 'eyebrows', 'positive', 'plot', 'point', 'genuine', 'affection', 'handled', 'warmth', 'jolly', 'humor.And', 'finally', 'energetic', 'subplot', 'subplot', 'involving', 'pregnant', 'waittress', 'named', 'Oola', 'underused', 'beauty', 'Jane', 'Adams', 'neurotic', 'James', 'Brown', 'lookalike', 'named', 'Vernon', 'hilariously', 'played', 'Richard', 'Knox', 'entire', 'block', 'film', 'feels', 'vintage', 'Coen', 'delightful', 'off-center', 'dialogues', 'moments', 'potentially', 'lethal', 'suspense', 'handled', 'farcical', 'sitcom', 'glee.But', 'ultimately', 'film', 'honest', 'human', 'emotions', 'relationships', 'are', 'heart', 'film', 'relationship', 'Douglas', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'rings', 'true', 'more', 'aided', 'McDormand', 'heartfelt', 'performance', 'once', 'Douglas', 'serve', 'kind', 'father', 'figure', 'Maguire', 'even', 'more', 'moving', 'could', 'be', 'Maguire', 'character', 'projects', 'vulnerability', 'intelligence', 'film', 'many', 'memorable', 'moments', 'center', 'was', 'eerily', 'mesmerized', 'scene', 'where', 'alphabetically', 'list', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'stars', 'have', 'committed', 'suicide', 'darkness', 'there', 'same', 'time', 'scene', 'poignancy', 'foreshadow', 'touching', 'scene', 'involving', 'Maguire', 'fascination', 'coat', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'wore', 'wedding', 'day.Curtis', 'Hanson', 'proven', 'classy', 'filmmaker', 'Gone', 'are', 'days', 'plastic', 'popcorn', 'entertainment', 'quot', 'Hand', 'Cradle', 'quot', 'quot', 'L.A.', 'Confidential', 'quot', 'now', 'proven', 'be', 'meticulous', 'intelligent', 'filmmaker', 'very', 'aware', 'nuances', 'elegant', 'cinematic', 'storytelling', 'how', 'work', 'sensibly', 'Hollywood', 'system', 'rare', 'see', 'mainstream', 'Hollywood', 'film', ""n't"", 'mainstream', 'quot', 'Wonder', 'Boys', 'quot', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'ultimately', 'sober', 'dramatic', 'comedy', 'intelligence', 'truth', 'even', 'questionable', 'fact', 'boldly', 'ultimately', 'be', 'anti-drug', 'parable', 'Hanson', 'point', 'so', 'subtly', 'wont', 'feel', 'as', 'patronized', 'should']",N/A
522566,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00003CXDI,"""flickjunkie""","[5, 5]","""Wonder Boys"" is a dark and intelligent comedy about choices.  Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) is a college professor who is the constant victim of the circumstances of his own life.  On the day we meet him, his wife has left him and the chancellor of the college (Frances McDormand) with whom he has been having an affair tells him that she is pregnant.  Add to that the fact that his star student has killed the chancellor's dog, and that his editor is in town to talk to him about the book he hasn't finished, and Grady is suddenly awash in crises that require pivotal decisions.  Unfortunately, deciding is not his forte.The humor in Steven Kloves (""The Fabulous Baker Boys"") screenplay is more that of dire irony rather than the whimsical inanity that characterizes most film comedies.  As such, the film didn't have much mass appeal, garnering a meager $19 million at the box office despite a very bankable cast.  Nevertheless, this excellent screenplay merited a Best Screenplay nomination from the Academy, and it is full of thoughtful dialogue and wry humor.Michael Douglas is terrific as the overwrought college professor.  Douglas shows a great deal of versatility here; playing an offbeat and tortured character that is unlike any he has played before.  Tobey Maguire (""Pleasantville"", ""The Cider House Rules"") turns in another fine performance expanding his boundaries with a much heavier and complex role.  He gives the character a moody depth that is both devious and impassive while maintaining a certain insecure naivet&eacute;.  Frances McDormand, as usual, delivers a strong supporting performance as the chancellor at a crossroad.  Robert Downey, Jr. is also fantastic as the quirky literary agent, adding a touch of absurdity to the otherwise dour script.Bob Dillon won an Oscar and a Golden Globe award for Best Song, and deservingly so.This is a strong film that will appeal to a limited audience.  I rated it an 8/10.

However, sometimes it`s way too clever for its own good, and the story is hardly groundbreaking material.

You add to that several sexual situations that are by far funny both ah-ah and strange and you have a hectic picture of what an ordeal such a life is : you lose your wife, you steal the wife of your boss, you kill his dog, you steal his precious property, you have to cope with transvestites and other gay or non-gay nymphomaniac both male and female people, you have to feed boys from rich families who rough it in a bus station in order to do what they want, to be independent and to realize what is a dream, you have to have your boss's book published, though it is austere s**t, in order to get your new book through and the book of your genius student put on the market, you have to lie to cops, to steal a car without knowing your are stealing it, you have to make your boss's wife pregnant just because cheating him is what makes you go on in a blind alley and forget that it is a blind alley, etc, etc. To be a writer in today's world is just a permanent ordeal in which you have to do everything unethical, everything farfetched and havoc-like just to have the fun and the thrills you need to fill up an empty page with some mental vomit that might eventually become golden plated and a best seller, which does not prove much anyway, except that you will be able to get some dough out of it and that will prevent you from going on with your surviving drudgery and slavery.

But I've found after multiple viewings that this film has definitely grown on me, maybe because I can relate to the main character, Grady Tripp, and maybe a tid bit with the character of James Leer.  Perhaps it's because I am a writer myself, perhaps I have dabbled in such pharmeceuticals Tripp (pun intended?) brings with him in his car, or perhaps not.I say also that this is like a Cheech and Chong for intellectuals since it has all the weird, laugh out loud moments of an Up In Smoke or Nice Dreams, yet it has so much more intelligence and detail payed to characters, plus is has some subtle moments thrown in, like they're are on occasion in a C & C opus.

Yes, it is, and he is a star in this film. He's not the only star of the film, though; Curtis Hanson's second film may not reach the standards of L.A. Confidential, but it surely the best college film in a long time, and is work of a high standard.Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) is a professor/writer living in Pittsburgh who is struggling with writer's block. Whilst doing this, he also manages to get the chancellor (Frances McDormand) pregnant. In the meantime, he and a college student, James Leer (Tobey Maguire) are trying to find a rare jacket once owned by Marilyn Monroe, and a college girl, Hannah Green (Katie Holmes) boarding with Grady has a bit of a crush on him.My expectations were a little high of Wonder Boys. I expected it to maybe earn over a score of 90, since Curtis Hanson went absolutely genius with the material given to him in L.A. Confidential. Even thought it didn't earn that high, the film is still a great piece of entertainment, one of the most plausible adult comedies of 2000. Michael Douglas is, as I said, a star. He deserved two Oscar nominations for this and Traffic, but hey, how dumb is the Academy? Douglas deserves some kind of award for absolutely ensemble performance. Tobey Maguire and Katie Holmes are good too - except Holmes is slightly underused - and both will provide plenty of laughs and body for teen and young adult audiences. Curtis Hanson is laid-back in this film, he knows exactly what he's doing, and does it like a master. The film comes and goes, it leaves us with not a fast enough pace sometimes. But with such cleverness and some flashy brilliant script writing, you won't have the time to notice.A drama that makes you laugh, and a comedy that keeps itself mature and serious.

522586,A18BV4O63DOWNH,B00003CXDI,"""juno2""","[2, 31]","Michael Douglas's Grady Tripp in  *Wonder Boys*  has a pile of troubles:  1)  his wife decamped,  2)  his mistress, the Chancellor of the small college where he teaches, is pregnant,  3)  his literary agent is demanding to see his novel-in-progress called  &quot;The Arsonist's Daughter&quot;, which, at 2,000+  pages, is STILL unfinished,  4)  a young attractive female student has a crush on him,  5)  another of his students, a troubled young writer named James Leer, is having some sort of breakdown,  6)  there's a dead dog in his trunk . . . on and on it goes.  After a brilliant career as noir director, Curtis Hanson goes abruptly  &quot;lit'ry&quot;, and I can't say that the change is for the best.  Taken from Michael Chabon's novel, *Wonder Boys*  is lacking in the stuff that made Hanson's other films so good:  namely, crime.  So he makes do with what's available:  there's a lot of pot-smoking; a touch of breaking-and-entering  (combined with the pot-smoking); a bit of gun-play  (hence the dead dog in the trunk of the car); even adultery.  I don't know if it's the source material -- not having read the novel -- or Hanson's interpretation of it, but the events herein seem as if they're pumped for maximum slam-bang value.  I mean, there's even, inexplicably, a transvestite on the premises.  All of this is going on during some sort of literary convention taking place at the college called  &quot;WordFest&quot;.  Having attended soirees like this, I can tell you first-hand that transvestites do not attend bookchat festivals, and for that matter, the attendees are far more prosaic than the loonies in this movie.  All this might have rang more true if Hanson had toned things down, but, considering his past work which tells stories of people living on the edge, this might not have been possible.At least the superb supporting cast provides relief.  Frances McDormand, Rip Torn, Tobey Maguire, and of course Robert Downey Jr.  make the most of their opportunities.  Unfortunately, the disappointment proves to be Michael Douglas.  Physically, he seems to be channeling Sally Jesse Raphael.  Acting-wise, it's all too clear that he is -- with great effort -- holding alter-ego Gordon Gekko firmly in check.  It's a way of saying he's unconvincing as a slobby English professor who loves pot and Neil Young records.I've heard that the studio re-released this picture recently, doubtless for consideration at Oscar-time.  Well, *Wonder Boys*  disappeared without a trace last February, which should have given the studio heads a hint:  it wasn't all that good.

Corn ""reviewer""","[1, 1]","The true test of this movie's winning nature and detailed focus on college academia and campus politics was when my husband, who teaches at a local college,  said he loved it (he was laughing throughout this movie). If I tried to give a bare bones outline of the plot, however, I'm afraid I'd discourage your interest but let me say that this one is far, far more than the sum of its various parts. I was a bit surprised, to say the least, that the same director made both this movie and L.A. Confidential. Then again, maybe that just shows how truly talented he is, able to do a superb job on such diverse films.  The biggest shock to me, however, was Michael Douglas. Looking every bit the part of a rather burned out, over the hill man facing personal and professonal setbacks, Douglas gave an amazingly skillful performance, actually reining himself in at times and then letting loose, but only when necessary. I'm glad he has learned to make the transition from handsome young man to an actor who has learned to use his maturity with grace and skill in films.  I'm used to seeing him in action-packed or suspense movies - the only movies of his that seemed even similar to his performance in Wonder Boys were Falling Down and The Game.. To my mind, Wonder Boys is the most compelling perfomance so far, mainly because of the humor that lightens the darkest moments.  Don't let me give you the impression that this movie is depressing and gloomy. It is often funny, even laugh out loud funny, and Toby Macquire, Robert Downey Jr, Francis McDormand and Rip Torn (that IS Rip Torn, isn't it?) hold their own in their roles. Katie Holmes is also quite compelling as a young student smitten by Douglas.  Often unpredictable and quite original, I'd put this high on your priority list of must-see movies. It is truly one of the best movies around. We watched Almost Famous the same evening and if I had to choose between the two, personally I'd chose Wonder Boys.

522590,A1JCOLQL6ENZJG,B00003CXDI,KC Reviews,"[0, 0]","Wonder Boys is not one of those movies you think is great because of the story, but is in fact an example of great acting and dialogue. While I think the story is interesting, I believe you could almost throw it out and as long as you maintained the cast and the dialogue, I still would have sat and been pleased to have watched. Personally, I am shocked to be writing this because I believe I am one of the greatest critics of Michael Douglas ever. I typically think he is a two bit joke whose been puffed up on Hollywood telling him he's wonderful-and no I am not jealous because he married Catharine Zeta-Jones.Instead, the chemistry between he and Toby McGuire is incredible. The way the two play off of each other makes you realize that there maybe is a craft to this acting thing after all. In fact, this movie makes me believe that Toby McGuire may become the finest actor of my generation. He rings of a modern day Jimmy Stewart with his subtle good looks and unique delivery. In fact, I think McGuire in Pleasantville was amazing and even his appearance on Saturday Night Live made me believe the show actually was funny. He has a gift and the performance between he and Douglas really demonstrates how vast a gift he has.The only criticism of the movie is that I feel like it was too caught-up being a writer's story. It felt a bit obsessed with making you feel as if you needed to understand the hierarchy and life of a writer. Newsflash to people who write stories about writers writing books and movies about making movies (especially you Get Shorty &amp; Bowfinger), we don't care how tragic or funny you think your little world is, find your catharsis elsewhere.In the end, I just feel that perhaps they should have watched a few David Mamet plays and then shot the movie.

522591,A1WBJZ4DXQCM14,B00003CXDI,"Kirby L. Wallace ""kirby at  wallaceinfo dee-o...","[3, 7]","First, I must say that the acting in this movie is monumentally, and universally great!  Douglas does his duty.  His performance is very reminscient of his role in &quot;The Game&quot; which is, to me, a five star film.  And Downey performs his usual magic (it's just a shame that such talent is wasted in such a lifestyle - he is so good, I just wish he gets his act together before the courts get it together for him).But the movie was inspiration for one thing - a new moniker for me: &quot;bottle-rocket plot development.&quot;  You briefly hear a hissing noise, something flys off in an random, odd direction, then BANG!  It's gone.Characters appear out of nowhere, do something seemingly random or bizzare, then disappear.  I believe that fully HALF the cast of characters could have been completely left out (along with their lines) with no perceptible effect on the story at all.Often, a plot thread is introduced and just as quickly disappears.  It's brought back, sometimes, about half an hour later or longer, and reintroduced.  The filmmakers seem to not realize that 45 minutes have passed with not so much as a mention of it.  Do they really believe that we haven't noticed it's been missing in action all that time?Example.  An elderly couple come home and find a strange young man in their house, lying on their couch, smoking a joint and drinking their whiskey.  Next scene? &quot;How about some hot chocolate and cookies, dear?&quot;  Please.  I don't care how comfortable you are with the guy he showed up with (Douglas), but who's going to go from wondering if they are being robbed to &quot;cocoa and cookies, dear?&quot;The movie, expertly portrayed as it is, plateaus immediately and maintains all the way to the sudden end.

That says something on its own.I think that Curtis Hanson was trying to make an intellectual slapstick comedy when he made Wonder Boys.

The adventure seeking sense and the intelligence seeking sense as well.Micheal Douglas.  Wow, I thought I knew ya.  But I had no idea he could be this loose and carefree and actually CONVINCE ME that he could play that role so well.  He really carried the movie with his ""let my hair down"" acting and his voice-overs.  Robert Downey Jr?  Previously, his smarmy acting has always annoyed me.  But I LIKED his smarmy acting in this movie.  That's what his role called for and he was perfect for the character he portrayed.  The other actors were good too but these two really shined.There's a small but revealing moment in this movie.  When Micheal Douglas and Toby McGuire are talking, a black and white movie is playing in the background.  It's the Picture of Dorian Gray.  The part of the movie we hear is ...""There's no such thing as a good influence.  All influence is immoral.  Why?  Because the aim of life is self-development.  To realize one's nature perfectly.  That's why we're here for.  A man should live out his life fully and completely.  Give form to every feeling.  Reality to every dream...There's only one way to get rid of temptation and that's to yield to it.  Resist it?  So goes sick with longing for the things for which it has forbidden itself.""That is what this movie is about.  Micheal Douglas denies himself nothing and gives form to every feeling and we get to enjoy the ride with him.  Watching him digging for drugs in someone's personal belongings and him swallowing said drug without even trying to figure out what it is.  And we get to watch him longing for the one thing that he wants.  The one thing which is forbidden to him.  The Chancellor's wife.  While Micheal Douglas the writer English professor is watching her with longing from afar, his voice-over says (and this is my very favorite part as I am a voracious reader myself) ""She was a junkie for the printed word and lucky for me, I manufactured her drug of choice.  She loved to read.  She read everything.  Every spare moment.""This movie is pure seduction for someone like me who loves word play.  Yes, one can enjoy this movie purely for the fun adventures and action and there is plenty to be had from beginning to end.  Heck, the adventures of Vern (or is it Vernon?) and his pregnant and angelic-looking-Marilyn-Monroe-Jacket-wearing-girlfriend is worth the price of the movie itself.  But beware, in the background, there is an intelligent thought and a bigger picture just waiting for you to dig even deeper into.For every dead dog almost-found escapade, there is Robert Downey Jr. spewing deep thoughts, for every page of the Professor's manuscript that gets tossed to the wind, there is a camera pan at a cover of THE PLAGUE by Albert Camus.Whereas the Picture of Dorian Gray ends sadly this Wonder of a movie ends happily for all - fitting and appropriate for all the characters involved.  I really enjoyed this movie and all it had to offer.  I am shocked that no one I knew has ever recommended this movie to me.  No wonder they call movies like this Sleeper films.

522596,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00003CXDI,Linda Linguvic,"[0, 1]","Adapted from the novel by Michael Chabon, this offbeat dark comedic drama is set at a college in Pittsburgh, a shabby city of bleak weather and aging buildings.  Michael Douglas is cast in the role of Grady Tripp, a college professor long past his prime who lives in haze of marijuana and failing marriages.  He's gained weight for this role and his face is lined and drooping, capturing the essence of the character so well that he was able to submerge his movie star image.  Tripp is a former &quot;wonder boy&quot; who had been acclaimed for his first novel seven years before.  Unfortunately, even though he has written more than 2000 pages on his second novel, he can't seem to bring it to completion even though his New York agent, Terry Crabtree, played by Robert Downey Jr. will be in town for the writer's weekend set up at the college.Tobey Maguire, the rising young actor who made a name for himself in &quot;The Cedar House Rules&quot; is cast as James Leer, a brilliant and troubled young writer from Tripp's class.  And Frances McDormand is cast as the Chancellor of the college who's having an affair with Trip.  Katie Holmes plays a student who is interested in Tripp for more than his teaching ability.  Other characters fade in and out of the scenes, adding interest and contributing to an eclectic mix and which somehow all add to the cohesive whole.  There's a transvestite as well as a professor affixed on Marilyn Monroe as well as a black man in a pompadour hairdo and his waitress wife. And, in addition to the people, there's a vintage car and an old manual typewriter and an electric selectric.  There's also a dead dog.All this is put together in a mix that gently pokes fun at it all, played for pathos and humanity instead of slapstick.  And it is all slightly off focus in the marijuana haze created by the professor.  I did find it a bit slow and I sometimes dozed off.  But the beauty of video is that could wake up and replay the few frames I missed.  I was always rewarded because of the subtleties of dialog and nuances of the acting and of the fine direction by Curtis Hanson, whose last film was L.A. Confidential.  I recommend this video although it is not for everyone.  It's quirky and offbeat and the pace is slow and hazy.

It's WordFest, the university's annual writing festival, which could not have come at a worse time. All hell has simultaneously broken loose and there's no end in sight. As Grady's tale unfolds director Curtis Hanson takes us on a whiz-bang trip through Pittsburgh that is both a coming of age story for young and old.Grady tells us his day started with his wife leaving him; no big deal they've done that before. His mistress, university chancellor Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand), is pregnant with his child (she also happens to be married to the English dept. head, Grady's boss).These are only the beginning. Grady's editor, Terry Crabtree (Robert Downey Jr.), is in town to try to get a look at Tripp's much overdue novel, which he desperately needs to save both of their careers. To top it off, Grady's  student Hannah Green (Katie Holmes), who is renting a room in his home, has the hots for him, there's a dead dog in his trunk, a stolen Marilyn Monroe jacket in his car, a James Brown want-to-be after Grady's car, and then there's James Leer.Leer (Tobey McGuire), a student of Tripp's, is a noticeably strange and talented young writer who idolizes Grady. Tripp won't let James waste his obvious talent and, even with all the things going on in his life, takes James under his wing, if just for a day. Their trip together finally allows them understand each other, what they've been through, who they are, and most importantly where they want to go and how to get there.Michael Douglas is absolutely fabulous as Grady Tripp, which one hopes leads him to taking on more roles like this where he plays a character of his actual age. McDormand is equally up to the task as the hard edged with soft inside Sara who pairs with Douglas well and we have no trouble believing they would be a compatible couple. Tobey McGuire plays his usual lost young adult role, which he does well. The individual that really impressed me was Robert Downey Jr. who plays his character with a a natural warmth and grace that allows us to embrace his unorthodox character.Curtis Hanson couldn't have picked a better follow-up to the critically acclaimed LA Confidential.

522603,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXDI,Matthew Horner,"[5, 5]","Wonder Boys is one of the quirkiest, funniest and most enjoyable movies around. It is the best movie about campus life I can ever remember seeing because it's about the people who live and work at a college as much as it is about the students. Being quite literate and intelligent, it moves at a pace slower than what some viewers require. I'm not saying it is sluggish. It is a movie about people's actions, or the lack of them, rather than about action itself.Middle-aged English professor Grady Tripp [Michael Douglas] is a wonder boy, which is the same thing as a one-hit wonder. This is someone who has enormous success with something but is unable to repeat the process. Grady wrote a best-selling and highly acclaimed novel seven years ago and still has not finished his second book. We watch him over the course of a fateful weekend that changes his life and those around him. His wife has just walked out on him. His affair with the head of the college, Sara Gaskell [Frances McDormand], is about to be hit by a big problem. His agent, Terry Crabtree [Robert Downey, Jr.], is coming to town for an important literary festival and will naturally ask about the book. Hannah Green [Katie Holmes], a student who rents a room from Grady, has fallen in love with him. And, for better or worse, another student. the strange and brilliant James Leer [Tobey Maguire], turns out to be the catalyst that brings all the weekend's incredible events together. In the end Grady will have finally learned that you can't succeed by just letting life happen. You have to make some choices.Wonder Boys was a real treat for me. It stars four of my favorite actors. Douglas has always been a competent performer, but in the last few years, he has stretched his range to good effect. This is his best role ever. Maguire, McDormand and Downey are top of the line. Downey is perhaps the best actor of his generation, and Maguire may turn out to be the best of his. McDormand can do no wrong. She simply isn't capable of a bad performance.Wonder Boys is one of a trio of movies released on DVD within a week of each other. They have much in common. Each was not a boxoffice success, but all of them are among the top five best American films of 2000. Each has acting that is as good as it gets. Each has a message, which it conveys well without forgetting the entertainment factor. Each is blessed with gifted script writing. The others are Almost Famous and The Contender. I hope each one finds the success it deserves in the home entertainment market.",5,"Wonderful 'Boys', Indeed!",1016323200,"03 17, 2002",2002,2537,"['Wonder', 'Boys', 'one', 'quirkiest', 'funniest', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'movies', 'best', 'movie', 'campus', 'life', 'can', 'ever', 'remember', 'seeing', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'work', 'college', 'as', 'much', 'students', 'Being', 'quite', 'literate', 'intelligent', 'pace', 'slower', 'what', 'viewers', 'require', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'sluggish', 'movie', 'people', 'actions', 'lack', 'rather', 'action', 'itself.Middle-aged', 'English', 'professor', 'Grady', 'Tripp', '[', 'Michael', 'Douglas', ']', 'wonder', 'boy', 'same', 'thing', 'one-hit', 'wonder', 'someone', 'who', 'enormous', 'success', 'something', 'unable', 'repeat', 'process', 'Grady', 'wrote', 'best-selling', 'highly', 'acclaimed', 'novel', 'seven', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'not', 'finished', 'second', 'book', 'watch', 'course', 'fateful', 'weekend', 'life', 'wife', 'just', 'walked', 'out', 'affair', 'head', 'college', 'Sara', 'Gaskell', '[', 'Frances', 'McDormand', ']', 'be', 'hit', 'big', 'problem', 'agent', 'Terry', 'Crabtree', '[', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', ']', 'coming', 'town', 'important', 'literary', 'festival', 'will', 'naturally', 'ask', 'book', 'Hannah', 'Green', '[', 'Katie', 'Holmes', ']', 'student', 'who', 'room', 'Grady', 'fallen', 'love', 'better', 'worse', 'student', 'strange', 'brilliant', 'James', 'Leer', '[', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', ']', 'out', 'be', 'catalyst', 'weekend', 'incredible', 'events', 'together', 'end', 'Grady', 'will', 'have', 'finally', 'learned', 'ca', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'just', 'letting', 'life', 'happen', 'have', 'make', 'choices.Wonder', 'Boys', 'was', 'real', 'treat', 'four', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Douglas', 'always', 'been', 'competent', 'performer', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'stretched', 'range', 'good', 'effect', 'best', 'role', 'ever', 'Maguire', 'McDormand', 'Downey', 'are', 'top', 'line', 'Downey', 'perhaps', 'best', 'actor', 'generation', 'Maguire', 'may', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'best', 'McDormand', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'simply', ""n't"", 'capable', 'bad', 'performance.Wonder', 'Boys', 'one', 'trio', 'movies', 'released', 'DVD', 'week', 'other', 'have', 'much', 'common', 'was', 'not', 'boxoffice', 'success', 'are', 'top', 'five', 'best', 'American', 'films', '2000', 'acting', 'as', 'good', 'message', 'well', 'forgetting', 'entertainment', 'factor', 'blessed', 'gifted', 'script', 'writing', 'others', 'are', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'Contender', 'hope', 'one', 'success', 'home', 'entertainment', 'market']",N/A

Mazza,"[4, 4]","&quot;Wonder Boys,&quot; directed by Curtis Hanson, explores some events in the life of a pot-smoking college professor (played by Michael Douglas) who is rapidly heading towards personal and professional crises. Based on the novel by Michael Chabon, this film is enlivened by witty dialogue and some terrific performances.Michael Douglas is the star of this film, and he really shines. He delivers a delightfully droll performance as the professor who is torn between his conflicting personal and professional commitments. The script walks the line between comedy and drama, and Douglas hits this balance perfectly. His performance in &quot;Wonder Boys&quot; is a stunning complement to his equally outstanding work in Steven Soderbergh's gritty drama &quot;Traffic,&quot; released in the same year.The supporting cast is also very good. I especially liked Tobey Maguire as Douglas' morbid, but oddly loveable student protege. And Robert Downey Jr. is a delight as Douglas' editor. Unfortunately, the female characters seem a bit underdeveloped, although Frances McDormand and Katie Holmes do their best with the material.I found &quot;Wonder Boys&quot; to be flawed in some respects. In particular, the film's ending left me somewhat unsatisfied. But the wonderful performances make this film richly entertaining.

522607,A27PSZX2SE0B51,B00003CXDI,Mike Stone,"[0, 8]","""Wonder Boys"" purports to take place at a small university in Pittsburgh.  Whatever.  I'd have an easier time believing it took place on Mars, inhabited by a strange sub-species of humanity that has been lobotomized of any sense of sanity.  Every character has a quirk or a twitch, designed to separate their existence from and endear them to the audience.  Grady Tripp can't seem to finish his 2000+-page novel or the baggie of pot stored in his glove compartment (although he tries and tries with both).  Book editor Crabtree is gay, with a penchant for both statuesque drag queens and morbid young authors.  Young author James Leer is brilliant and talented, yet he is prone to roaming the woods at night with an antique cap gun, and has a kleptomaniacal fetish for Marilyn Monroe memorabilia.  It goes on and on like this.  This character is weird.  That one's strange.  Look at this interesting tick!  Admire that fetish, that obsession, that self-destructiveness!  There are no (absolutely none, believe me I looked) characters here normal enough to ground the movie in any kind of sanity.  Even the weather gets in on the action.  One memorable day starts out with a torrential downpour of rain, shifts into a sunny and spring-like afternoon, and degenerates into a snowstorm at night.  I never realized Pennsylvania had such an unstable weather system!I get the feeling that all this madness was better suited to the printed page than the screen.  I haven't read Michael Chabon's source novel, but I assume he explains why James Leer has a Marilyn fixation (telling me that she's ""lonely"" and hey, so is he, is not enough).  Or why Grady and Crabtree feel justified in rescuing Leer from the horrors of his upper-class parents, and then immediately hand him over to the police.  Or how a small Pittsburgh university can organize an event called ""WordFest"" (!), and draw thousands to an auditorium for a speech by the pompous English department chair (and furthermore, how said small university can boast not one, but two big-time authors on its faculty).  The movie never delved into these issues, and I for one found the whole mess confusing.That's not to say that I didn't have fun trying to muddle through the confusion.  Mostly, the credit for that should go to the actors.  The cast is populated by a host of my favourites.  Frances McDormand makes me melt everytime she bugs out those fiercely intelligent eyes of hers.  Her character, the university chancellor (as well as the ""other"" woman), could have easily been loathsome.  But she has such warmth and appeal, that by the end you sympathized with her situation fully.  Tobey Maguire does this kind of dead-eyed wounded deer role perfectly.  I bought his character's obsessions, passions, and intelligence without giving it a second thought.  Robert Downey Jr. had what I think was the toughest role, in that he had to bring humanity and likability to his prowling and maniacal book editor, who's eager for another success but unwilling to push his author too much.  And he had the tough job of seducing Maguire's character without looking completely lecherous.  I think he pulled it off.  Rip Torn and Katie Holmes had small and somewhat insubstantial roles.  He did his best in portraying a blustering author blessed with commercial success.  She was little more than wallpaper.  And what to say of Michael Douglas?  I've never really enjoyed the man's work.  He is at his best, though, when he can use his movie-star chin and rich voice to portray men of dignity and power (I enjoyed him most in ""The American President"").  Here he is disheveled and self-destructive, sporting unkempt hair and peculiar glasses.  So, does it work?  In the beginning, no.  But I do admit that by the end, Michael Douglas got lost in there somewhere, and all I saw on the screen was Grady Tripp (the transformation occurred right around the time when his narrative voiceovers stopped; it is a technique used too often unsuccessfully).  So, kudos Mike.The one thing that director Curtis Hanson did get right was exorcising most examples of the writing the characters produced.  ""Finding Forrester"" fell into this trap.  You can't tell me this writer is gifted, and then read to me examples of his work that border on illiterate.  Here, we get flashes of James Leer's prose, and if you look hard enough you can read a couple of lines from Tripp's novel.  But it's kept to a minimum, thus keeping intact the illusion that these people are all special talents.In the final analysis, ""Wonder Boys"" left me confused and empty, unsure of what the point of the whole endeavor was.  But while I was watching it, I was engrossed in the characters' very illogical lives, wondering if any of it would make sense in the end, but suspicious that it didn't really matter anyway.",3,Life on

522618,A1MC81HLJ6Z9ZQ,B00003CXDI,Paul McGrath,"[22, 55]","I'm beginning to wonder if there is anybody left with any talent in Hollywood.  Somebody with some minor amount of originality, or intelligence, or creativity.  You sure can't find it in this movie.  It is so bad that you almost wonder if they intend these things to be stupid.  Is it propaganda?  This movie is clich&eacute; piled upon clich&eacute;, with a foundation of blatant political correctness, and beyond that, it is clumsily, insultingly stupid.  It is a horrible film.I'm not going to rehash the plot because if you're reading this, you've probably seen it.  I'll just go through some of the stupidities, and do so by focusing on the kid.  First of all, we are meant to know he is a good writer because he's very sensitive.  He cries rivers of sincere tears when he holds Marilyn Monroe's jacket.  Nevermind intelligence, or education, or study, or guidance;  sensitivity is all it takes to be a good artist.  Didn't you know that, you idiot?Marilyn's jacket.  The kid goes all goggy over it.  We've already been bludgeoned into accepting the kid as an aspiring genius as a writer, but the only person the creators of this film can think of to have him emulate is Marilyn.  Not Sartre, or Hemingway, or Hesse, or Salinger, or any of the hundreds of other famous or obscure WRITERS that a precocious kid might like, but Marilyn Monroe.  Do the filmmakers feel that their audience would be too stupid to pick up the literary allusions?  Or is this all that they can come up with themselves?  Or maybe this Marilyn fixation is meant to be satirical.  Is that it?  Maybe the Marilyn fixation is meant to show how vapid campus intellectual life is:  the finest student in the school is nevertheless fixated upon such cultural irrelevance as the career of the showgirl, Marilyn Monroe.  But, alas, that is not it either.  She is treated far too reverently.  How pathetic.The parents of the kid.  They are uncaring, if you haven't guessed.  We are meant to know they are uncaring because the woman is wearing a fur coat and the father is wearing a tuxedo.  This means they are rich.  The rich are uncaring.  Get it?  After being dragged from wherever they were to come to the dumpy diner that the Michael Douglas character has their kid in, they don't even bother to get out of the car.  Unbelievable.  Stupid and unbelievable.Somewhere during this scene--Douglas falling apart, the kid going through his psychosis--we see them together and the Neil Young song, ""Old Man,"" comes on the soundtrack.  You know, ""Old man, look at my life, I'm a lot like you were . . . "" I actually guffawed at the blatant, dopey, obviousness of this.  Did somebody actually think this up?  And nobody laughed at him (or her) and told them how stupid it was?  And they put it in anyway?  Have we, as a society, really become so sheepish that we need to be guided by such maudlin doltishness?Society has pretty much accepted homosexuality now, and of course, Hollywood has as well, which also means that they have accepted all forms of it.  So when the kid--who is probably eighteen or nineteen--is seduced by the flamboyantly gay editor--twenty years his senior--we are simply meant to shrug.  The kid wakes up and we see that he is nonchalant;  ho hum, just another night in some older man's bed.  Really?  But the movie portrays the kid as nave--he doesn't even drink.  It is implied that this may be his first sexual experience;  or at least, his first homosexual experience.  But again, he wakes up looking as if he's just finished playing a game of chess.  C'mon!  Is Hollywood so afraid of offending somebody that it can't even show a little ambiguity here?  A little?  A tiny bit?  Any?  Nope, we get none.  This is a good example--and this movie is rife with them--of writing the story so that it conforms with currently accepted politically-correct dogma.  As we've come to expect, it is completely out of touch with reality as anybody--gay or straight--knows it.And how does the kid get there?  Well, he's typing away (yes, typing, on a typewriter), comfortable and sober in his parents' basement.  Our heroes, Douglas and Downey, decide they must rescue him.  (From the terror of his parents' oppresive, art-stultifying, upper middle-class, traditional-value home, we are meant to realize).  As mentioned, he ends up in Downey's bed, with an approving nod from his mentor, Douglas.  He is awakened the next morning in order to be taken to jail, for the various misdemeanors committed by himself and his new companions over the last couple of days or so.  Now, these misdemeanors were committed with at least the help of Mr. Douglas, if not his outright encouragement, and as he's being hauled off to jail, they wave to him, as if he's going to camp or something.  ""Goodbye son!  Don't eat too many marshmallows!""  He's GOING TO JAIL!  He's going to jail because of these guys, these adults, his teachers, his mentors, and THEY HAPPILY LET HIM!  Like it's no big deal!  They don't even go with him!Of course the kid goes and has the same one-dimensional, flat look on his face that he's carried heroically throughout the course of the rest of this drivel, but don't get me started on the acting.  Space limitations prevent me from discussing the other preposterous elements of this film, but believe me, they are equally insipid.

Therefore, he came to town to see Tripp and along the way, he brought along his transvetite friend.  Tripp happened to be fascinated with one of his students, Tobey McGuire's character who was tragically talented.  Then, there's Katie Holmes, from Dawson Creeks who was in her second major pictures (after The Gift) as an infatuated student to Tripp who boarded at his place.  After an accident shooting of a blind dog, Tripp, the publisher, the students' lives were all intertwined together in a hillarious roller coaster ride.  Frances McDermott (of the Fargos) played Tripp's mistress who was pregnant with his child.  What complicated the issue was France's character was already a married woman.  Towards the end, Tripp finally saw clearly what he wanted in life and only then, everybody seemed to come together in their rightful places.  Then, there's also Marilyn Monroe's jacket, Joe Dimaggio's baseball, an chicken-eyed Indian, a waitress and Tripp's rundown car....what did they have to do with the story?

Given the unfairness of this reality it makes my heart soar in the rare instance that the terrific movie in no way detracts from a terrific book and that they can be equally good in different ways.Such is the case with &quot;Wonder Boys.&quot; Take a perpetually-stoned professor/novelist, his bi-sexual editor, a brilliant, suicidal, pathologically untruthful student (a collector of Hollywood suicide trivia), throw in one transexual, Marilyn Monroe's wedding jacket, and a dead dog and you have all the ingredients for a lost weekend.Steve Kloves delivers a wonderful screenplay from Michael Chabon's novel, laying the groundwork for Curtis Hanson's impeccable direction and the perfect musical compliment of Bob Dylan. While many novels suffer mightily in their necessary condensation to the screen, Kloves preserves the book's basic plotline and adds scenes of his own invention that are so concise and so wonderful they sent me racing back to the novel to reread phantom passages I must have missed the first time.When Professor Tripp (Michael Douglas) and his editor, Terry Crabtree (Robert Downey Jr.) enter the home of James Leer (Tobey Maguire) to rescue him from his parents, Crabtree discovers James' story-in-progress in the typewriter (remember those?). In the film, James has crafted a thinly-veiled portrait of his professor/mentor that leads to the first of a small string of epiphanies in the film. The window shades are thrown open on Tripp's comic heart of darkness. As wonderful as this scene is, the book offers us a different picture. In the book what we see is Tripp secretly reading from James's new novel, making a spiritual connection with his difficult-to-understand student.I recognize my own connection to a work when I have difficulty separating my own lust from the fictional reality. In both book and movie I found myself helplessly drawn to Hannah Green (Katie Holmes), the common-sensical/sensual student who comes on to Tripp, not realizing the depth of his problems. I guess I must have identified with Tripp because I kept finding myself rooting for him to give in to her advances, regardless of consequences.But perhaps I've said too much...Do yourself a favor -- see the movie.

522626,AUA64NQ3X56OJ,B00003CXDI,Richard Nelson,"[2, 2]","A bit of bad luck at the box office prevented this movie from getting the hype it so richly deserves. Good luck finding roles into which Michael Douglas, Frances McDormand, Tobey Maguire, and Robert Downey, Jr., slip into as effortlessly and brilliantly as they do the ones in this film. With a script that neatly repackages Michael Chabon's excellent novel for the screen, Steve Kloves (lately the screenwriter for the Harry Potter series) shows where he mastered the craft of adaptation. And director Curtis Hanson follows up the tour-de-force of L.A. Confidential with this funnier, more bizarre, and ultimately more enjoyable effort.On one level, the movie plays out like a drug-induced dream sequence; it's almost implausible that so much would happen during a single weekend. Michael Douglas loses his wife, discovers his girlfriend (McDormand) is pregnant, flees the university at which he and his girlfriend work with his darkest and most troubled student after that student kills his girlfriend's husband's dog and steals Marilyn Monroe's wedding coat, exposes that student to pot and his literary agent of ambiguous sexuality, has his car stolen, loses a 2,000 page manuscript...Did I mention that his girlfriend is the chancellor and her husband is the chair of the department that employs Douglas?Yet all these events--and many more--feel very real during the movie. And not in the dreamlike way that anything makes sense while you're sleeping: this movie has the feel of truth. Other reviewers have complained that it's too weird, that each character's eccentricities pile on those of the others until it passes a level of acceptability. But people have quirks; some people are pathological liars, some people just like one kind of shoe, some people can only write in a pink bathrobe. In life we take these quirks for granted in the people we know and love; in Wonder Boys a group of people are thrown together, quirks and all, by fate and common interest and the confines of a very realistic university life. The interplay of their quirks, and the way that people who come to them with sympathetic eyes quickly rally to support one another, makes for a movie that engages, entertains, and provokes thought. If that's not what you look for in a movie, look elsewhere. If it is, prepare to add a new movie to your all-time favorites list.",5,Best Michael Douglas role ever,1087776000,"06 21, 2004",2004,2350,"['bit', 'bad', 'luck', 'box', 'office', 'prevented', 'movie', 'getting', 'hype', 'so', 'richly', 'deserves', 'Good', 'luck', 'finding', 'roles', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'slip', 'effortlessly', 'brilliantly', 'do', 'ones', 'film', 'script', 'neatly', 'Michael', 'Chabon', 'excellent', 'novel', 'screen', 'Steve', 'Kloves', 'lately', 'screenwriter', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'where', 'mastered', 'craft', 'adaptation', 'director', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'up', 'tour-de-force', 'L.A', 'Confidential', 'funnier', 'more', 'bizarre', 'ultimately', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'effort.On', 'one', 'level', 'movie', 'out', 'drug-induced', 'dream', 'sequence', 'almost', 'implausible', 'so', 'much', 'would', 'happen', 'single', 'weekend', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'wife', 'girlfriend', 'McDormand', 'pregnant', 'university', 'girlfriend', 'work', 'darkest', 'most', 'troubled', 'student', 'student', 'girlfriend', 'husband', 'dog', 'steals', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'wedding', 'coat', 'student', 'pot', 'literary', 'agent', 'ambiguous', 'sexuality', 'car', 'stolen', '2,000', 'page', 'manuscript', 'Did', 'mention', 'girlfriend', 'chancellor', 'husband', 'chair', 'department', 'Douglas', 'events', 'many', 'more', 'feel', 'very', 'real', 'movie', 'not', 'dreamlike', 'way', 'anything', 'sense', ""'re"", 'sleeping', 'movie', 'feel', 'truth', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'complained', 'too', 'weird', 'character', 'eccentricities', 'pile', 'others', 'level', 'acceptability', 'people', 'have', 'quirks', 'people', 'are', 'pathological', 'liars', 'people', 'just', 'one', 'kind', 'shoe', 'people', 'can', 'only', 'write', 'pink', 'bathrobe', 'life', 'take', 'quirks', 'granted', 'people', 'know', 'love', 'Wonder', 'Boys', 'group', 'people', 'are', 'thrown', 'together', 'quirks', 'fate', 'common', 'interest', 'confines', 'very', 'realistic', 'university', 'life', 'interplay', 'quirks', 'way', 'people', 'who', 'come', 'sympathetic', 'eyes', 'quickly', 'rally', 'support', 'one', 'movie', 'entertains', 'provokes', 'thought', 'not', 'what', 'look', 'movie', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'prepare', 'add', 'new', 'movie', 'all-time', 'favorites', 'list']",N/A

Rare is the movie, these days, that's laugh-out-loud funny. Rarer still is that movie actually a drama, a sort of absurdist metatragedy about the decline and fall of a University professor who seems bound and determined to destroy his life and his career in the shortest possible time.Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) is that professor, a man who wrote one vastly popular, critically acclaimed book seven years before, and has been unable to finish its follow-up. On the weekend of a big to-do at the school where he teaches, his editor, Terry Crabtree (Robert Downey, Jr.), comes into town to get a look at this legendary manuscript Tripp has spent the last seven years writing. At the same time, James Leer (Spider-Man's Tobey Maguire), a neurotic student, has just finished his own manuscript; his relationship with Sara Gaskell (Frances MacDormand), the University chancellor's wife, is going through a rough patch; and his boarder, Hannah Green (Katie Holmes), has picked the worst of all possible times to turn up the pressure on him to get involved romantically with her. Everything's lined up for either salvation or damnation, or possibly both, and Tripp seems bound and determined to figure out as many ways as possible to stick his fat in the fire while still leaving himself that one last road. As we all know, however, the road to hell is paved with good intentions...When Curtis Hanson is on his game, he's one of the best in the business, and he's definitely on his game here. It helps that he pulled in a fantastic stable of actors to realize Steven Kloves' fabulous script, from the justly famous Michael Chabon novel of the same name.

Such was the case with ""Wonder Boys,"" a phenomenal film that came out in February of 2000. THough the studio wisely re-released it much later in the year, it failed to gain any further momentum. This is a pity, because ""Wonder Boys"" is one of the most well-written, offbeat, and clever films to come out in a long, long time.Michael Douglas gives what is undoubtedly the performance of his career. As Grady Tripp, a middle-aged author/college professor who is having what is seemingly the weekend from hell, Douglas is convincing and touching.  As his eccentric, troubled student, Tobey Maguire is fantastic. The two of them are aided by a terrific supporting cast, including Frances McDormand, Robert Downey Jr., and Katie Holmes.Perhaps the real hero of this film, however, is director Curtis Hanson.  Like he did with Los Angeles and the Hollywood Hills in 1997's ""L.A.

522632,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00003CXDI,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[4, 6]","Michael Douglas is Grady Tripp, a moderately famous author who hasn't been able to follow-up the promise of his first novel, ""Arsonist's Daughter"".  Toiling away teaching undergrad writing at an old New England university (actually, it looks pretty much like Penn), he lusts after Sara, (Frances Mcdormand) the wife of a dean.  Though she seems as interested, she suspects Grady of secretly harboring hopes of patching things up with his ex, and she's married anyway, to another dean who spends money buying Hollywood memorabilia on E*Bay.  With no prospects, he endures constant nagging from his agent, Terry Crabtree (Robert Downey, Jr., in another of those ambiguous roles that he could have written himself) about the prospects for the planned follow-up to ""Arsonist's Daughter"".  Unable to tell Crabtree of his lack of progress, Tripp toils away at the typewriter while smoking pot and churning out pages to a book that has now numbers over 2000 pages.  Tripp's marijuana habit, probably innocuous at one time, now causes blackouts and has otheriwse destroyed his focus and ability to write cogent books of less than 1000 pages.  The story picks up when Grady discovers somebody even more sexually and morally ambiguous than himself and Crabtree put together - one of Tripp's own students. James (Toby Maguire).  Though a seeming failure at writing (Tripp's other writing workshop students unanimously despise James' work which they see as epitomizing Catholic angst, or simply bad), James has already written a novel, as Tripp discovers when taking the dark-minded student under his wing (his writing skills aside, James can also tell you how each Hollywood legend - in alphabetical order - killed themselves).""Wonderboys"" is actually a lot of fun, but it begins seeping out of your head before it even comes to an end.  Curtis (""LA Confidential"") Hanson's direction offers tons of fun twists, but none of them connect into a story, and, by the time the flick is half-done, you're ready to ignore any new ones.  Working with a script by Steve (""Fabulous Baker Boys"") Kloves, Hanson almost defeats himself.  He creates a sense of time and space - literary lions are gathered at the university for its annual ""Wordfest"", but then relegates the event to a backburner: it's business as usual for the pot-smoking Tripp, with no tension or release promised by the coming event.  James is also a trip, with Grady discovering the student's tortured spirit actually a carefully constructed shell, covering up an existence of comfort.  Nothing explains James' invented character other than his being a compulsive liar with a habit born by a naturally imaginative spirit.  Tripp himself is a bundle of problems but they're mostly inconsistent - he can't openly love Sara, but his hopes for reuniting with his wife make that seem pointless.  He can't finish his book, but it's not clear that he even has the direction to want to finish the book.  He wants to help James out of his created self, but also wants to develop the boy's writing craft.  Grady doesn't so much mull over these conflicts as simply changing his mind.  It's almost like the script is at war with Tripp - between it's own hopes for a coherent story and Grady's lack of ambition, with Grady the winner.  The script tosses in some more twists just so the story should have something to think about besides Grady's aimlessness - a towering transvestite, a dead dog, a stolen sweater worn once by Marilyn Monroe, a borrowed car - maybe stolen - and Rip Torn as a fellow teacher who's been wildly more successful at selling books than Grady.  None of these things get enough attention to make a score, with the script giving more attention to the wordplay between Michael Douglas, Downey Jr., and Maguire than the story.  In one magicla scene, set in a college-town bar, the three characters mull around and play a game for authors, and imagine whole identities and life-stories for the people that populate their surroundings.  It's fun and a sign of the meditation on writing that ""Wonder Boys"" probably wanted to be.

522636,A13910TC3NZ6LE,B00003CXDI,Sam Bethune,"[1, 2]","&quot;Wonder Boys&quot; is a quirky yet very entertaining comedy.  It represents something old yet something new from Michael Douglas in that although he is once again playing a dark, conflicted character, this time the portrayal is for comedic effect.Douglas' character is Grady Tripp, a drugged out professor of literature whose life has slowly but steadily gone out of control since publishing the great American novel seven years earlier.  His third wife has just left him and the wife of his boss (Frances McDormand), with whom he has been having an affair, is pregnant with his child.These plot twists and several more, such as a dead dog, the theft of a jacket once owned by Marilyn Monroe, Tripp's desparate female-impersonator dating literary agent (Robert Downey Junior), a brooding but brilliant writing student (Tobey Maguire, who has a gift for remembering celebrity suicides) and some crazy guy claiming that Grady's car belongs to him, all clash during a weekend writing festival being held at the college where Douglas teaches.  The twists, turns, and interaction of all of these plot elements and characters provides for some dark but incredibly funny comedy.Surprisingly there are a number of negative reviews of this picture...., for example, says Maguire is &quot;smarmy&quot; and &quot;ruins every picture he's been in&quot;.  She's wrong.  Maguire stands out as one of the best of his generation of actors.  &quot;She also refers to Douglas' voice as &quot;droning&quot; and makes it quite clear she never liked his acting to begin with.  I wonder why she even bothered to watch this film in the first place given her attitude and disdain for the actors.Although some may choose to dismiss &quot;Wonder Boys&quot; as &quot;trashy&quot;, pretentious, or just too dark, I actually think this could be one of the best motion pictures Michael Douglas has done in a while, and another tour-de-force bit of direction by Curtis Hanson (&quot;L. A. Confidential&quot;).  This film also includes a very good soundtrack featuring Bob Dylan's Oscar winning song &quot;Things Have Changed.&quot;The DVD is loaded with extras including cast and director interviews, a discussion of the music used in the film, and a map of various shooting locations.  Just as in &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;, director Hanson does a very good job of explaining the creative process in the making of the picture although his recitation sounds canned.&quot;Wonder Boys&quot; is defintely not a comedy for those who just want to sit there and be entertained.

Michael Douglas plays Grady Tripp, a guy who smokes pot to get through his day, and meeting up with his gay publisher.As the movie progresses, marching out these cast of characters, I was struck by the chemistry of the actors. Katie Holmes, an aspiring writer herself, wants more than a student/teacher conference, but the script does not play her up well. Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man) plays the gay publisher, who has not had a hit ever since Grady's successful novel, though it's been seven years.No, the focus is on Tobey Mcguire's (Spider-man) character, James Leer, who is a chronic liar, runs away from his rich parents and his only saving grace is his writing. James shoots a blind dog and steals a Marilyn Monroe jacket for kicks and Grady tries to get him through it.Surviving the weekend, Grady makes some choices in his life including giving an angst-ridden writer (who has many problems) a chance at a novel.I was intrigued by the chemistry and the writing really helped this film, although slow at times and a bit tiresome as the plot plods along. Grady wants the chancellor, played by Frances McDormand (Fargo). I don't get what he sees in this plain, stoic woman who can't make up her mind about Grady and frankly treats him like crap.Good film for film and writing students to see, R-rated for drug use.",3,Writer's Block?

522641,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,B00003CXDI,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[0, 1]","""Wonder Boys"" came with a sterling recommendation from a friend--an MFA in creative writing--who swore it was the most true-to-life movie about writers he'd ever seen. So, I watched it with the appropriate mixture of anticipation and reservation, and as often happens when something is hyped, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. In fairness, it's a pretty well-made movie, a kind of indie ... that has a sense of grit and gristle usually missing from Hollywood films. The soundtrack is cool. The locations are Pennsylvania dingy. It captures the oaken squalor and pompous self-importance that is a four-year college English Department (even if no one there ever does any work). And it has a stellar cast; Michael Douglas, Tobey Maguire, and Frances McDormand, in particular, deserve kudos for inhabiting their roles. But, the movie also has Robert Downey, Jr., to contend with, which makes me wonder just what compromising photos his agent has to regularly get this one-note male version of Winona Ryder work. It wants to be set in the late 60s, though it purports to be contemporary. And it's characters--while quirky--never quite seem arthouse authentic; in fact, Douglas' Grady Tripp is the rumpled, immature, oversexed pothead everyone thinks is the prototypical English professor, right down to sleeping with the department chair's wife (McDormand). Of course, there are professors who fit this stereotype, or at least parts of it, but the combination is cliche and calculated to give Grady excuses for his screw-ups rather than show him to genuinely be a screw-up. The plot is mostly a mishmash of set-ups for ironic, semi-literate dramedy--think ""Sports Night"" meets ""Henry and June""--as Grady's intoxicated life starts to come apart, and by the time his fecund manuscript blows into the river (Grady eschews word processors and photocopiers, it seems), it devolves into farce. And it uses a voiceover, a big no-no among screenwriters! Still, even with all that against it--and a happy ending, to boot--there is just enough goofy charm to make ""Wonder Boys"" worth a look, mostly the result of the actors' sincerity.

The performances by Douglas, McDormand, Downey and especially Toby Maguire are first rate.  As a matter of fact, I pre-ordered it from Amazon the day after I saw it.  Seeing it again on DVD produced mixed emotions.First:  I mean really ""first.""  Before the movie starts, the screen is filled with the HORRIFYING message:  ""This film has been edited for content.""  WHAT????  This set up a sense of foreboding that never left me as I watched the movie.  Not to worry: the content that was actually edited turns out to be in the list of celebrity suicides cited by Tobey in what I suppose is the movie's first act:  Evidently, the theatrical version contained factual mistake[s].Second:  The sound is pretty dull.  You'd think a picture that won its only Oscar for best song would have a digital track.  It does not.  Dolby 5.0 and 2.0 are your choices.  Neither very attractive.Third: Extra Features - REALLY lame.  A running commentary by director Hanson would have been nice.  The book's author, Michael Chabon, would have been even better.  As it is, we get a whimsical tour through Pittsburg with the director.  Blyuuck.Fourth:  There are annoying spots in the transfer where the image gets stuck and lines of dialog are lost. I know this has something to do with ""layering"" and, apparently, can't be avoided, but I've never seen it as bad as on this DVD.Summing up:  This movie never got the attention it deserved from audiences, and now it has gotten a sloppy DVD transfer.

No, wait, I have a second regret - that I didn't have time to watch it again immediately after the first look.This is a movie the viewer watches in awe for a number of reasons:  Awesome story: What's going to happen next and why doesn't it phase Grady Tripp in the least despite the fact that it's likely to be bad and he can't possibly anticipate it?  Awsome direction:  how does Hanson seemlessly weave all these apparently diverse characters into a continous story line?  Awesome emotions:  Just when the audience is looking for a sad note, the cast, writer and director find a way to get a laugh.This film is not funny in the spirit of the Marx Brothers, What's Up Doc? or Animal House.  The laughs come unexpectedly and from left field and quickly move the viewer into the next scene before he/she realizes it.Micheal Douglas is superb as Grady Tripp, professor and one time (trying to become at least two time) author, whose life is in a shambles.  Despite the insanity in Tripp's life, Douglas lets Tripp just roll with it.  Toby Maguire portrays the strangely interesting character James Leer who is overly interested in suicide and a budding author himself.  McDormand shines as Tripp's true love as the chancellor of the university where Tripp teaches.  Robert Downey is absolutely whacky as Tripp's editor whose life is hitting the rocks in its own way.  Katie Holmes is excellent as Tripp's tenant who just might want to do more than sleep in his house.Despite the crazy weekend Tripp is living through there is little happening to the characters that doesn't fit or seems out of place.  At the end, the viewer is treated to Bob Dylan's rockin' theme &quot;Things Have Changed.&quot;In the background, the film is almost a guide to writing a novel or story.

The main character is Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas).  Tripp is an excellent name for this character because throughout the movie, he experiences a series of falls, making it necessary for him to change his life.  Tripp is a writer who had one successful novel but can't finish his second novel.  This writer's block is symbolic of Tripp's inability, in essence, to take an active role in the transformation his own life.  Douglas's performance of Tripp is masterful:  sensitive, outrageous, and funny.James Leer (Tobey Maguire)is a younger version of Tripp.  James has just finished his first novel, and in James, Tripp sees vestiges of his former self.  Tripp, however, has lost his real reason for writing and has become jaded with writing and love.  Leer is the perfect name for this character, since he ""sees"" into Tripp's soul and understands that the great man has become lost.  Maguire's performace is as strong as Douglas's and in the same ways.  At once we feel a fascination with James Leer, a great curiosity and also sympathy.  James has talent but few people encourage him:  this is why Tripp is so important to James.  Tripp is the ""best"" teacher James has ever had because Tripp recognizes and tries to cultivate James's talent.  At the same time, Tripp plays a fatherly role for James, initiating him into a larger, adult, world.Pittsburgh provides the perfect setting for characters who are trying to move from one shore to another in their lives.  The characters continually cross one of the many bridges in that city, which is as beautiful in its hope as it is terrible with grit and despair.A series of events brings Grady Tripp to a point where he must make a choice about his life.  Just as Pittsburgh is the place where three rivers meet (and thus is a place of magic and mystery, a sacred place), Grady Tripp is torn between three woman:  the wife who has left him (who comes from an Ozzy and Harriet-type home); the young temptress (Katie Holmes) who is much like the women Tripp always ""falls"" for; and his mistress (Frances McDormand) who is more Tripp's age and who is his intellectual equal, if not his superior.A fun movie, packed with great sight gags, sensitive portrayals of characters, sophisticated choices by the director about setting and music, and witty dialogue.

522650,A3EJVZ5LCBP61X,B00003CXDI,"TOMMY C ELLIS ""Prison Rev.""","[2, 10]","Yes, this is a funny, ultimately warm-hearted film.  Michael Douglas is a loveablely grumpy professor-writer.  He fumbles through the story in a likeable, yet truly lackluster fashion.  He loses his very young and beautiful wife because ""he's not there.""  He keeps putting off the romantic advances of a very young student/boarder of his, not so much because it would be wrong, but because he apparantly does not have the time or energy to deal with it.The professor's co-star is a young, very gifted, most insightful, yet possibley suicidal student, whose difficult to figure out because he's a habitual liar.The professor's boss is having an affair with him, is pregnant by him, is frustrated by his indecisiveness, and yet seems willing to follow his lead--if he'll give it.Wonderboys speaks well to our need to wake up and live life.  But, it seems to suggest that just making choices is enough--being decisive, regardless of what decision is made, is the key.  Live good, live bad--but live intensively!  Thus, the film does marvelously what I really hate about ""typical Hollywood movies"":  it normalizes, sympathizes, and heralds immorality, by wrapping it up in adorable characters.  The boss's husband supposedly is clueless about the affair, and therefore deserves it?  Does a young female student, obviously in love with her professor, really belong boarding in his house?  Is it right for a homosexual editor to make shameless advances on a boy who is probably psychologically troubled, and who shows no obvious signs of like attraction?  Finally, does adultery really need to be glorified, as it ultimately is in this movie?Bottom-line:  If Wonder Boys were judged only on humor and acting it might garner 4 points.

Katie Holmes is better than her personal average in her role.  Frances McDormand is about on par with her other roles (which is rather good).

522654,A1WL2EKE4TAEJP,B00003CXDI,"Tyler Durden ""Mutton Man""","[8, 9]","Back during my late high school years, my father bought the ""Wonder Boys"" soundtrack. Hearing Bob Dylan's powerful and poetic masterpiece ""Things Have Changed"" was something that captivated me. Even though I hadn't seen the movie yet, Dylan's lyrics were nothing short of brilliant and just downright truthful. Sort of a bluesy feeling and self-loathing track, but done in a humorous way. At least, that's what I think of the track. Hearing this track got me wanting to watch the movie for myself.Upon first viewing, the words that come up at the beginning of the movie kinda bugged me, telling the viewer that this movie was modified and edited. I panicked, but hearing Michael Douglas' character, Professor Grady Tripp, say the ""f"" word got me relieved... although I wonder why that ""disclaimer"" is even shown at the beginning of the film...?The movie was nothing like I expected it to be. I expected an emotional drama that a simple-minded high school student won't understand. It's a movie that centers around Professor Grady Tripp. He's had it rough lately. His girlfriend leaves him, his other lover Sara (played by the wonderful Frances McDormand) is pregnant and contemplates on whether to have an abortion or not, one of his college students, James Leer (played by Tobey Maguire in probably his best role to date) is a moody person that Tripp doesn't understand, nosey editor Terry Crabtree (played hilariously by Robert Downey, Jr.) is hounding Tripp about his unfinished novel, which Tripp can't finish because he suffers from writer's block and ultimately wrote a 2000+ page epic that just goes on and on... and to make matters worse, Tripp has been experiencing blackouts and resorts to drugs to ease down.This may look like some typical drama, but the most surprising thing about this movie is the fact that it's funny. I mean, it's just downright hilarious. So many odd things pop up, which only adds to Tripp's problems. His editor is going out with a *ahem* transvestite. His student, James Leer, shot a dog that belong to Tripp's lady friend Sara's husband, who happens to be Tripp's boss. I mean... this is one wacky movie. It's what some people categorize as a ""dark comedy,"" ""black comedy, ""comedy/drama,"" or like how I categorize it: a ""dramedy.""Even with its numerous humorous (heh... I made a funny!) scenes, the movie is also very touching. Despite Tripp's problems, he still manages to be a good teacher, as well as mentor, to James Leer. He wants to be a good husband to Sara (even if she's already married to his boss). And most of all, Tripp wants to finish his damn book so he could get Crabtree off his back.""Wonder Boys"" is truly one of the best movies of recent times. Wackiness ensues, but don't think of this as some slap-stick comedy. Think of it as more intelligent and witty humor. And there's the story of a teacher and a student that discover that there's pleasure and happiness in life. A severely underrated masterpiece and it ranks in my top ten favorite films of all-time. It was released in the year 2000, which I call the year of bad, awful, and lame movies. ""Wonder Boys"" isn't one of them.
