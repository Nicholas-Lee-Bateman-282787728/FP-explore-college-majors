149312,AYPCUQS6ARWFH,0792843231,"Andre M. ""brnn64""","[18, 18]","Aw later for you, Leonard Maltin! This movie is GREAT! This is an important story about friendship and manhood. Young Larry Fishburne's admiration of &quot;Cornbread&quot; rings true with any child who had an older friend to admire as a role model. But the outstanding part is where Fish's mother (Rosalind Cash) tells Fishburne to go to the courtroom stand and BE A MAN and not to be intimidated into giving false testimony of Cornbread's death at the hands of the police as the other witnesses were! This scene borught tears to my eyes and a &quot;standing-o&quot; from the audience I saw it with. This scene alone, with the message it gives to young people about integrity, is worth the price of admission alone!",5,Good film about the importance of friendship and manhood,991353600,"06 1, 2001",2001,715,"['Aw', 'later', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'movie', 'GREAT', 'important', 'story', 'friendship', 'manhood', 'Young', 'Larry', 'Fishburne', 'admiration', 'quot', 'Cornbread', 'quot', 'rings', 'true', 'child', 'who', 'had', 'older', 'friend', 'admire', 'role', 'model', 'outstanding', 'part', 'where', 'Fish', 'mother', 'Rosalind', 'Cash', 'Fishburne', 'go', 'courtroom', 'stand', 'BE', 'A', 'MAN', 'not', 'be', 'intimidated', 'giving', 'false', 'testimony', 'Cornbread', 'death', 'hands', 'police', 'other', 'witnesses', 'were', 'scene', 'borught', 'tears', 'eyes', 'quot', 'standing-o', 'quot', 'audience', 'saw', 'scene', 'alone', 'message', 'young', 'people', 'integrity', 'price', 'admission', 'alone']",N/A
