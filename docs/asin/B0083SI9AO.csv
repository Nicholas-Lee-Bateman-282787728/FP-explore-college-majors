1545500,AYG1U47VFZ165,B0083SI9AO,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[1, 2]","Full disclosure!  Full disclosure!  Yes, I'll admit it: I'm a bit of a Doctor Who nut.  Maybe not what you'd call a full-fledged Whovian (Google it, if you're at a loss or so inclined), but quite probably I'm very close to it.  I first met the Doctor in his fourth incarnation (God Bless us all, Tom Baker!) when it aired on PBS here in the United States, and I mostly stayed faithful to his era, though I've picked up on DVD or caught a few episodes here and there of other `Doctors' since.  I'm still young enough to be openly enthused by the Doctor's ongoing love of exploration, and I'm old enough to know more than a thing or two about his `history' on television.That said, I'll admit that I was never a big fan of Sylvester McCoy's particular stint as Gallifrey's remaining Timelord.  To be honest, I don't much fault him; given the times, the shape of things to come in modern television, and the fact that the stories were running a bit thin by the program's twenty-fifth season, I think much of the Doctor's universe had grown a bit tired.  Still, the fact that he looked like an everyman's uncle - maybe even a run of the mill dentist - didn't help matters, and tales like THE GREATEST SHOW IN THE GALAXY probably didn't endear fans all that much at the time, either.The Psychic Circus had come to town ... well, to the planet Segonax, anyway.  Whereas most circuses are built on thrills, chills, and spills, this one was predicated on abducting members of the audience and then put them through the motions.  If (and when) they failed, then they'd perish - all at the request of the sinister three-person family sitting in judgment in the top row - but just who are they?  What are they seeking?  And how will the Doctor and his trusty companion, Ace (who happens to hate clowns), fare when they're given their time in the center circle?To the story's credit, it's more of a cautionary fable than some of the other Who-fare that has aired throughout the years.  And most of it is benign - while dealing with some `heavy' material, the Doctor always remains a winsome character with a heart (or two) of gold.  Ace is a lovable chum - a teenybopper-ish tagalong who's there to question whatever status quo is presented.  Like any good companion, she's fast on her feet, so she'll help put the good Doctor through some paces as well.  As well, there are a few irregulars who show up to help lift the narrative up a notch or two - a somewhat devilish biker-from-Space, some half-retired Space general, and a troupe of the creepiest looking clowns in all the galaxy.But this SHOW never quite develops into anything more than a modest diversion - a circus sideshow, if you will - in the theatre of otherwise great Who storytelling.  McCoy - a gifted showman in his own right - does the best he can with the material he's given; however, his showdown with the three galactic judges (I'll preserve their identity in order to respect not spoiling anything should you pick this one up) is decidedly anticlimactic.  In order to stall for time, he's earning Vaudeville stripes by doing cheap tricks, minor balancing feats, and pulling eggs from his mouth.  Sorry, folks, but that's not the Timelord I grew up with.DOCTOR WHO: THE GREATEST SHOW IN THE GALAXY is produced by the BBC, and DVD distribution is handled through BBC and BBC America.  It all looks and sounds fairly solid though there were a few sequences with a noticeable dip in audio quality.  If you've had the good fortune of picking up practically any of these releases of the Doctor's, then you should be familiar with the fact that they're chocked full of some very respectable extras, and SHOW does not disappoint.  There's a terrific audio commentary with a host of cast and crew; there's a making of featurette that explores some of challenges they encountered specifically in assembling this story at a time of budgetary upheaval for the BBC; there are some deleted and extended scenes (not much is learned, but they're nice to have and see); and there are even a handful of other features that look at music, special effects, and the like.  There's even a terrific little examination of where Doctor Who was at the time - the challenges they faced both as a show and as a commodity the BBC has built up - and a great examination of some of critical reaction to McCoy's particular interpretation of the lead.  It's nothing short of magnificent, and, even though I found the episodes somewhat forgettable, I learned quite a bit about the program that continues to inspire me even in its current incarnation today.RECOMMENDED for serious Whovians only as I don't think you'll win over many new converts with THE GREATEST SHOW IN THE GALAXY.  Sure, it's quirky, somewhat clever, and at times even fun, but much of SHOW seems quite dated, even by Doctor Who's most benign standards.  Filmed in the late 80's, so so much of it looked like the late 80's - not necessarily a bad thing, just not a good thing when compared to the rest of what's offered by the franchise.  However, I'd be a fool if I didn't tell you how much time, effort, and care went into collecting these special features; they're a hoot - or is that Whoot? - and shouldn't be missed.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the good folks at BBC America provided me with a DVD screener of DOCTOR WHO: THE GREATEST SHOW IN THE GALAXY for the expressed purpose of completing this

1545502,A20FK68BUB1IVA,B0083SI9AO,Happy Reader,"[10, 10]","The Doctor and Ace receive a mysterious advertisement for the Psychic Circus, on the planet Segonax, and decide to check it out. Ace isn't happy about it. She is secretly afraid of clowns (it's called coulrophobia), but the Doctor insists on going.Well, this is one circus that won't put Ace's fears to rest, that's for sure. Before the Doctor and Ace arrive on the scene, we see a clown jester in white face, with a predator's smile, tracking two circus escapees. One dies, the other, the Bellboy, is taken back to his circus cage.When Ace and the Doctor arrive at the circus, they realize there is something very weird here. There's only three people in the audience, a father, mother and exceedingly creepy little girl. Well, all three are creepy. The Ringmaster is creepy, the clowns are creepy, especially the Chief Clown, who chased down the escapees.This is one circus where you will just die to take part. And there's a twist.""The Greatest Show in the Galaxy"" first aired December 1988-January 1989. This review is for the upcoming August 2012 DVD, which is the first time this show has been released on DVD. It will be one disc of 98 minutes.I read that an asbestos scare at the BBC studios helped inspire an episode that could be shot outside the studios, such as in a large tent!  Otherwise, ""The Greatest Show in the Galaxy"" may have gone the way of ""Shada"".Doctor Who performs some magic tricks when it's his turn in the circus spotlight. Sylvester McCoy was coached by ""The Great Soprendo"", stage name of Geoffrey Durham.This seems to be a love-it or hate-it episode. I'm in the former camp, and Ian Reddington as the menacing Chief Clown has a big part in that. And I love the scene where they approach the circus, and in the background sky is a big pinkish planet with rings around it.Extras:1.  Commentary With actors Sophie Aldred (Ace), Jessica Martin (Mags, one of the circus ""acts"" and a great character) and Christopher Guard (Bellboy), writer Stephen Wyatt, script editor Andrew Cartmel and composer Mark Ayres. Moderated by Toby Hadoke. At one point, Mark Ayres talks about the difficulty of filming in the outside tent: ""Every time a delivery track turned up to unload the beer for the club, we had to stop shooting for a few minutes.""Andrew Cartmel talks about Mags' transformation (spoiler!). Dr. Who's monsters/creatures were too often cheaply done. But for Mags, he said, ""...the makeup and the costume is fantastic. Jessica does a great job with it. It's genuinely scary, it's a proper monster, and so often our monsters didn't work, and this is exactly how we should have done the Cheetah People in 'Survival'. It's the way we wanted to do them, instead of the teddy-bears they turned out. If we'd done them like this, it would have been magnificent."" [""Survival"" was the very last Classic Dr. Who episode, airing in Nov/Dec 1989.](Added after my DVD was received and watched:) Everybody agreed that the series title was awful. It was required by John Nathan-Turner, the producer, however, and he had his reasons. Cartmel says, ""It's a dark story. But it's a glitzy title. ... It doesn't sound like a science fiction title.""2.  ""The Show Must Go On: Making the Greatest Show in the Galaxy"", a short where members of the cast and crew look back on the making of this story. Sylvester McCoy, unfortunately, does not take part (except in outtakes), but participants include Andrew Cartmel, Sophie Aldred, Alan Wareing (director), Ian Reddington (Chief Clown) and Mike Tucker (visual effects assistant), David Laskey (designer)and John Nathan-Turner (producer) from an archive interview.  Reviews I've seen of it thought this extra was very good. Ian Reddington was badly hurt in an accident on the set, and that (unused) scene is shown and discussed.(added after my DVD was received and watched:) There are so many things that go into making the mood for a show. A lot of them are little, and the audience probably doesn't appreciate them. (Well, we're not supposed to say, ""Boy, that music is creepy. We're just supposed to FEEL creepy.) In an example of one of the little things that makes a difference, Wareing talks about the hearse that the Chief Clown drives. ""I wanted it to have the electric windows. ... It was important for me that the window just went down to reveal the Chief Clown. I couldn't see him winding them down himself.""Laskey talks about the hippie bus of the Psychic Circus - the original bus they used before everything went wrong. The derelict bus was buried to the wheels in the sand at the quarry. BBC didn't have the money to pull it out after shooting, so they got permission to leave it. Maybe it's still there today.3.  Deleted and Extended Scenes4.  ""Lost in the Darkness: The Greatest Show in the Galaxy's Missing Model Shots"". Mike Tucker explains the model effects created for the series, but ultimately not used.5.  ""The Psychic Circus"" (2012). A music video set to a song written by Christopher Guard and featuring vocals by Christopher Guard, Jessica Martin and TP McKenna (who plays The Captain). Keyboards and programming by Mark Ayres. This is rumored to be so bad it's good.(added after my DVD was received and watched:)  -  I LIKED it!""D-D-D-Doctor!...There is no escaping usWe are the Psychic Cir-Cus""6.  ""Remembrance"" Demo. Two scenes from the ""Remembrance of the Daleks"" series, re-scored by Mark Ayres. He was asked for these demos before he was given the contract for the music of ""The Greatest Show in the Galaxy"".7.  ""Tomorrow's Times - The Seventh Doctor"". The on-going series looking at the press coverage of Doctor Who reaches the Sylvester McCoy era. Anneke Wills moderates, and, to put it mildly, the Seventh Doctor was not much appreciated by the British press.8.  ""Victoria Wood"".  Doctor Who sketch from the TV series ""Victoria Wood - As Seen on TV"". It's a send-up and humorous.9. Photo Gallery10. Production Information Subtitles11.

That's the nifty parts, the less than ideal part is that the outdoor scenes were mostly filmed in a quarry, but this is augmented by special effects which make it somewhat better. The final baddies were a bit out of left field for me, and I felt they didn't really fit in with the rest of the story. However, it wasn't too out of line for Doctor Who of the late '80's.The DVD extra's feature both Sylvester McCoy and Sophie Aldred as well many other members of the cast and production team discussing the making of the episode.

It's a very entertaining story with some good action & memorable characters like Mags & Captain Cook, the selfish & arrogant intergalactic explorer (he reminded me of an evil version of Commander McBragg, as well a dark counterpart to the Doctor).  The villains behind it all were quite creepy.

I did, however find Sylvester McCoy's Doctor to be excellently written and brilliantly portrayed. After I watched &#34;Remembrance of the Daleks,&#34; McCoy was cemented as my personal favorite Doctor. What does this have to do with &#34;The Greatest Show in the Galaxy?&#34; Just that Sylvester McCoy, and the Doctor, are at their best here. It's definitely one of his darker portrayals, which I loved, particularly in his last season. What complements McCoy's acting here is the brilliant writing and Sophie Aldred's excellent performance as Ace. The Chief Clown is creepily played by Ian Reddington, and he is excellent as well. In fact, excellent pretty much sums up this entire story.The sets are convincing, the location footage is great, and every supporting character is memorable, with the exception of Whizz Kid. There are some really interesting plot twists, like the one at the end of episode 3 and partway through episode 4.

Almost every single Doctor Who serial is available through Netflix, but there are a few, mostly the most recently released Doctor Who serials, that aren't available on Netflix yet and I decided to check out this serial without really previewing it, so to speak. It is actually an interesting story, and it does draw parallels between 'The Greatest Show in the Galaxy', the Psychic Circus, and Doctor Who, although it doesn't praise itself too highly. There is a dark undercurrent to the Psychic Circus at this point in its history, according to the players, as the idealism of its past, symbolized by 60s/70s hippie counterculture, has died out and now it is a very grim place that has betrayed the wide-eyed optimism and love of its greatest fan, feeding him to the lions, so to speak.
