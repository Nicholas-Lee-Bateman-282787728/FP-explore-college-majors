At the same time the murderer realizes he has left behind an important piece of evidence at the house that will connect him to the crimes. Now he has to go back to the scene of the crime to retrieve the evidence and Mia Farrow has to run for her life to prevent becoming the killer's next victim.

380705,A106016KSI0YQ,6303588980,Jay Dickson,"[0, 0]","Fragile, waiflike, and tentative, Mia Farrow was absolutely perfectly cast in ROSEMARY'S BABY, and spent much of the next ten years (until she met Woody Allen, who gave her more varied parts) playing the prey for Satanists, murderers, witches, and ghosts. In one of the more beautifully done of these victim stints, she plays Sarah, a woman who comes to live with her aunt and uncle and their daughter after she is blinded in a horse accident. Early in the this film, she returns from a day of riding to their beautifully appointed mansion in the autumnal English countryside: the utter silence in the house and the low camera angles suggest something is not right. The director, Richard Fleischer, takes him time as we watch Sarah navigate through the house's many halls and rooms, making coffee for herself in the kitchen; we see broken glass  (which she narrowly avoids stepping on, through pure luck) on the floors, but we still don't know what's wrong until she's in bed, and we see her beautiful cousin's corpse sprawled out unnaturally in the bed next to her. All the family have been slaughtered.This scene is so scary and carefully done that almost nothing could compare to it... and for  long time, nothing in the film does. Fleischer films everything beautifully, though, and scarily shows the killer (who wears star-embossed cowboy boots) only at a low level, so you don't find out who he is until the end of the film. Unlike WAIT UNTIL DARK (its clear direct inspiration), the film does not act to empower its blind heroine so much as to use her handicap as an opportunity by which she might be subjected to all sorts of nasty spills and mishaps: of course eventually she does step on that broken glass in the kitchen, and also runs through the wrong door leading into the cellar, rides a horse into a low-hanging branch, tumbles down a steep muddy hillside... it all gets to be a bit much. (The biggest suspense in this long middle section is actually whether the terrified Farrow will stumble in her panic into the many priceless vases and fragile objets d'art her relatives have somewhat tactlessly left on the side tables in all their long hallways.) The film does have a great final sequence, though, involving Farrow washing off in a bathroom.",4,Sadistic,1393372800,"02 26, 2014",2014,2262,"['Fragile', 'waiflike', 'tentative', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'was', 'absolutely', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'ROSEMARY', 'BABY', 'spent', 'much', 'next', 'ten', 'years', 'met', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'who', 'gave', 'more', 'varied', 'parts', 'playing', 'prey', 'Satanists', 'murderers', 'witches', 'ghosts', 'one', 'more', 'beautifully', 'done', 'victim', 'stints', 'Sarah', 'woman', 'who', 'live', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'daughter', 'blinded', 'horse', 'accident', 'Early', 'film', 'day', 'riding', 'beautifully', 'appointed', 'mansion', 'autumnal', 'English', 'countryside', 'utter', 'silence', 'house', 'low', 'camera', 'suggest', 'something', 'not', 'right', 'director', 'Richard', 'Fleischer', 'time', 'watch', 'Sarah', 'navigate', 'house', 'many', 'halls', 'rooms', 'making', 'coffee', 'herself', 'kitchen', 'see', 'broken', 'glass', 'narrowly', 'avoids', 'stepping', 'pure', 'luck', 'floors', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'wrong', 'bed', 'see', 'beautiful', 'cousin', 'corpse', 'sprawled', 'out', 'unnaturally', 'bed', 'next', 'family', 'have', 'been', 'slaughtered.This', 'scene', 'so', 'scary', 'carefully', 'done', 'almost', 'nothing', 'could', 'compare', 'long', 'time', 'nothing', 'film', 'Fleischer', 'films', 'everything', 'beautifully', 'scarily', 'killer', 'who', 'star-embossed', 'cowboy', 'boots', 'only', 'low', 'level', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'who', 'end', 'film', 'WAIT', 'UNTIL', 'DARK', 'clear', 'direct', 'inspiration', 'film', 'not', 'act', 'empower', 'blind', 'heroine', 'so', 'much', 'use', 'handicap', 'opportunity', 'might', 'be', 'subjected', 'sorts', 'nasty', 'spills', 'mishaps', 'course', 'eventually', 'step', 'broken', 'glass', 'kitchen', 'also', 'wrong', 'door', 'leading', 'cellar', 'horse', 'low-hanging', 'branch', 'down', 'steep', 'muddy', 'hillside', 'be', 'bit', 'much', 'biggest', 'suspense', 'long', 'middle', 'section', 'actually', 'terrified', 'Farrow', 'will', 'stumble', 'panic', 'many', 'priceless', 'vases', 'fragile', 'objets', ""d'art"", 'relatives', 'have', 'somewhat', 'tactlessly', 'left', 'side', 'tables', 'long', 'hallways', 'film', 'have', 'great', 'final', 'sequence', 'though', 'involving', 'Farrow', 'washing', 'off', 'bathroom']",See No Evil VHS

Mia Farrow has fallen victim to some sort of an accident while riding a horse which seems to suggest she some how unfortunately lost her eye sight as a result of the ordeal. She returns home for a visit, and this is when we are treated to the best parts of this movie. As Mia's Character learns to find her way around and re-adjust to life in a world of darkness, she characterizes these aspects so well that it really makes us think about how it really must be to suffer the scourge of blindness. She is quickly associated as a person with a great sense of will and determination, so when she is asked by one of the other characters in the film ""What's it like?"" we nearly expect her to say ""It really isn't so bad, you get used to it"". Instead she declares ""It's bloody horrible"". I really admired the script for allowing us to see this plight in a more realistic manner. Mia Farrow lovingly creates a wonderful performance. She's superb and believable as a vulnerable blind woman in peril. She has always had this earthy, doe like quality to her. She's so sweet and innocent that she fits well into these characters being pursued in horrible ways because she is so delicate that the audience wants so badly to reach out and help her.

This film reminds me of another english thriller called FRIGHT which is about a baby sitter.Mia Farrow is convincing as a blind woman who returns to a house where her auntie and uncle have been murdered, but she does not realise straight away.  The killer returns to collect an item he left behind and she must fend for her life.Has been done better in alot of other films. You could easily give this a miss. In fact, I just saved you 90 minutes of your life. You can thank me later.",3,See no evil is not really worth seeing,1184112000,"07 11, 2007",2007,648,"['may', 'have', 'been', 'scary', 'back', '1971', 'slow', 'paced', 'thriller', 'gave', 'bit', 'yawn', 'needed', 'reach', 'fast', 'forward', 'button', 'get', 'good', 'bits', 'film', 'english', 'thriller', 'called', 'FRIGHT', 'baby', 'sitter.Mia', 'Farrow', 'convincing', 'blind', 'woman', 'who', 'house', 'where', 'auntie', 'uncle', 'have', 'been', 'murdered', 'not', 'realise', 'straight', 'away', 'killer', 'returns', 'collect', 'item', 'left', 'behind', 'must', 'fend', 'life.Has', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'alot', 'other', 'films', 'could', 'easily', 'give', 'miss', 'fact', 'just', 'saved', '90', 'minutes', 'life', 'can', 'thank', 'later']",See No Evil VHS
