This is not a slasher flick, and there's virtually none of the blood or gore that usually comes with it. While there are death scenes, most are not graphic, but this does not distract from the movie at all. In fact, the film almost passes for a major motion picture, from the quality of the camera work, to competent acting and terrific scenery.The storyline involves a group of young people getting away to a cabin in the quiet countryside, where legend has it a murderer has been been at large since killing his family decades earlier. It does make a nice back story, and sets the tone for a nice twist that I did not see coming that ultimately changes the tone of the movie (in a good way). There is a good deal of suspense and tension, and several scenes are simply delightfully creepy without the presence of any blood, spooks, or demons. This is not visceral horror. Rather, it is that rare treat that uses the actual tale to create a mood. It's a nice change of pace from the torture and mayhem that have passed for thrillers recently.",4,Far more than I expected,1243296000,"05 26, 2009",2009,1111,"['sometimes', 'wonder', ""'m"", 'watching', 'same', 'movie', 'reviewers', 'not', 'slasher', 'flick', 'virtually', 'none', 'blood', 'gore', 'usually', 'are', 'death', 'scenes', 'most', 'are', 'not', 'graphic', 'not', 'distract', 'movie', 'fact', 'film', 'almost', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'quality', 'camera', 'work', 'competent', 'acting', 'terrific', 'scenery.The', 'storyline', 'group', 'young', 'people', 'getting', 'away', 'cabin', 'quiet', 'countryside', 'where', 'legend', 'murderer', 'been', 'been', 'large', 'killing', 'family', 'decades', 'earlier', 'make', 'nice', 'back', 'story', 'tone', 'nice', 'twist', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'coming', 'ultimately', 'tone', 'movie', 'good', 'way', 'good', 'deal', 'suspense', 'tension', 'several', 'scenes', 'are', 'simply', 'delightfully', 'creepy', 'presence', 'blood', 'spooks', 'demons', 'not', 'visceral', 'horror', 'Rather', 'rare', 'treat', 'actual', 'tale', 'create', 'mood', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'torture', 'mayhem', 'have', 'passed', 'thrillers', 'recently']",Sams Lake

The movie is very atmospheric, creepy, suspenseful.  I know how it feels to be acity kid feeling out of her element in the sticks, and of course, no small rural town is complete without a fewweird locals.  The scenery around the lake is beautiful and disarming.  How could anything terrible happen here?The story that Sam tells her friends is campfire-worthy, and then the trip to the murder house-very scary!It has a shocking surprise waiting at the end.  I won't give away too much, but...SPOILER ALERT!

1232639,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B001R10BJQ,trebe,"[5, 7]","Sam's Lake (2005) is a suspense adventure that after a long wait, only provides a few minor thrills.  Sam (Fay Masterson) hosts some friends at her cabin at Sam's Lake, and along with local resident Jesse (William Gregory Lee), spooks the group with the tale of a man who escaped from an institution, returned home to butcher his family, and then escaped into the woods.  Visiting the abandoned house where the murders occurred, the group finds the killer's hidden journal, which serves as a prelude to the mayhem to come, as soon members of the party are running for their lives in the woods.After a buildup that takes 55 minutes, the payoff is rather disappointing, as most of the violence is off-screen, or not very graphic.  The hapless city folk, apparently without a cell phone between them, and the sense to keep running, don't present much of a challenge for the thrill seeking killers.  Fortunately for one victim (Sandrine Holt), the hunters get their priorities crossed, enabling her to continue on.The chase begins at night, but there must be a very fierce full moon out, because the woods are pretty well lighted most of the time.  Some might have trouble navigating in the woods without tripping, but it is remarkable how well these people are able to move freely without even a flashlight.Having a spiritual connection to family, is a recurring theme.  This is a little twisted, considering the dysfunctional family found here.  The killers are in tune with nature, as they frequently lift their noses to the wind, and take a big sniff to get on the trail of their prey.  Something does definitely smell here.With other more exciting and satisfying wilderness thrillers around, it is hard to recommend Sam's Lake.  The story is unconvincing, the characters are not particularly likeable, and it largely fails to deliver in the action and gore department.",2,family funtime at Sam's Lake . . .,1258243200,"11 15, 2009",2009,1869,"['Sam', 'Lake', '2005', 'suspense', 'adventure', 'long', 'wait', 'only', 'few', 'minor', 'thrills', 'Sam', 'Fay', 'Masterson', 'friends', 'cabin', 'Sam', 'Lake', 'local', 'resident', 'Jesse', 'William', 'Gregory', 'Lee', 'group', 'tale', 'man', 'who', 'escaped', 'institution', 'returned', 'home', 'butcher', 'family', 'then', 'escaped', 'woods', 'Visiting', 'abandoned', 'house', 'where', 'murders', 'occurred', 'group', 'killer', 'hidden', 'journal', 'prelude', 'mayhem', 'come', 'soon', 'members', 'party', 'are', 'running', 'lives', 'woods.After', 'buildup', '55', 'minutes', 'payoff', 'rather', 'disappointing', 'most', 'violence', 'off-screen', 'not', 'very', 'graphic', 'hapless', 'city', 'folk', 'apparently', 'cell', 'phone', 'sense', 'keep', 'running', 'do', ""n't"", 'present', 'much', 'challenge', 'thrill', 'seeking', 'killers', 'Fortunately', 'one', 'victim', 'Sandrine', 'Holt', 'hunters', 'get', 'priorities', 'crossed', 'enabling', 'continue', 'on.The', 'chase', 'night', 'must', 'be', 'very', 'fierce', 'full', 'moon', 'out', 'woods', 'are', 'pretty', 'well', 'lighted', 'most', 'time', 'might', 'have', 'trouble', 'navigating', 'woods', 'tripping', 'remarkable', 'how', 'well', 'people', 'are', 'able', 'move', 'freely', 'even', 'flashlight.Having', 'spiritual', 'connection', 'family', 'recurring', 'theme', 'little', 'twisted', 'considering', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'found', 'here', 'killers', 'are', 'tune', 'nature', 'frequently', 'lift', 'noses', 'wind', 'take', 'big', 'sniff', 'get', 'trail', 'prey', 'Something', 'definitely', 'smell', 'here.With', 'other', 'more', 'exciting', 'satisfying', 'wilderness', 'thrillers', 'hard', 'recommend', 'Sam', 'Lake', 'story', 'unconvincing', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'likeable', 'largely', 'deliver', 'action', 'gore', 'department']",Sams Lake
