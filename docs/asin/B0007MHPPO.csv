The movie plays loose with the facts as various characters play the rolls of Al Capone, Jim Colosimo, Johnny Torrio, Dean O'Banion, Hymie Weiss, Bugs Moran, and Machine Gun Jack McGurn.  All the gangsters play their rolls to the hilt with the stereotypical cigarette dangling between their lips.  I guess this movie illustrates how far movies have come since the 1930's.

883029,A2CW9IQAPFEYLM,B0007MHPPO,Bomojaz,"[7, 7]","A landmark movie in that it was the first to present the gangster, always portrayed up to this point by Hollywood as a misunderstood good guy gone wrong, as a senseless, moronic, cold-blooded lunatic. Paul Muni plays Tony Camonte (Scarface - obviously based on Al Capone), a hood on the way up in 1920s Chicago, who discovers the Tommy gun and shoots up half the city while gaining control of it. It also happens that he's in love with his sister, which just adds to his perversity.The movie has a stagey ""unnaturalness"" to it, as most movies of the time did, but it's an eyeful: men are shot down left and right, businesses riddled by machine gun fire, car chases (19 cars wrecked) galore.Muni is excellent, parading around like some Neanderthal Man, and blasting a machine gun is almost like sex to him - only better. The movie was a big step forward for Hollywood in showing the amount of realism the quickly developing cameras could portray, if allowed to.Note: Real bullets were used when the coffee shop was shot up; one curious spectator  - silent film star Harold Lloyd's brother - lost an eye when he got too close to the set.",5,Crazy man on the loose,1129680000,"10 19, 2005",2005,1135,"['landmark', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'present', 'gangster', 'always', 'portrayed', 'up', 'point', 'Hollywood', 'misunderstood', 'good', 'guy', 'gone', 'wrong', 'senseless', 'moronic', 'cold-blooded', 'lunatic', 'Paul', 'Muni', 'Tony', 'Camonte', 'Scarface', 'obviously', 'based', 'Al', 'Capone', 'hood', 'way', 'up', '1920s', 'Chicago', 'who', 'Tommy', 'gun', 'shoots', 'up', 'city', 'gaining', 'control', 'also', 'love', 'sister', 'just', 'perversity.The', 'movie', 'stagey', 'unnaturalness', 'most', 'movies', 'time', 'did', 'eyeful', 'men', 'are', 'shot', 'down', 'left', 'right', 'businesses', 'riddled', 'machine', 'gun', 'fire', 'car', 'chases', '19', 'cars', 'wrecked', 'galore.Muni', 'excellent', 'parading', 'Neanderthal', 'Man', 'blasting', 'machine', 'gun', 'almost', 'like', 'sex', 'only', 'better', 'movie', 'was', 'big', 'step', 'forward', 'Hollywood', 'showing', 'amount', 'realism', 'quickly', 'developing', 'cameras', 'could', 'portray', 'allowed', 'to.Note', 'Real', 'bullets', 'were', 'used', 'when', 'coffee', 'shop', 'was', 'shot', 'up', 'one', 'curious', 'spectator', 'silent', 'film', 'star', 'Harold', 'Lloyd', 'brother', 'lost', 'eye', 'when', 'got', 'too', 'close', 'set']",SCAREFACE/ dvd
883030,A26HFSVLAGULIM,B0007MHPPO,"Heather L. Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""","[5, 5]","A ""TALKY"" THAT CARRIES QUITE A WALLOP -- for 99 MINUTES!,IN A NUTSHELL: NO GLAMORIZING OF PUBLIC ENEMIES HEREA dark and dank insight into the depraved and exciting world of bootlegging gangsters at their worst.WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT: [WARNING -- CONTAINS PLOT SPOILERS BELOW]Tony Camonte [Paul Muni], is the lead, and a character patterned after Al Capone (also called ""Scarface"")but not in every way. The obviously amoral Camonte gradually seizes control of the bootlegging racket, from Johnny Lovo (Osgood Perkins), his boss, through a series of barbaric murders which eventually include Johnny Lovo. Apparently, Camonte's ambition is translated into brutality as his sole constructive force, which is hardly constructive at all. There is no bargaining, communicating or making deals, Camonte simply kills everyone that stands in his way even if it is really not needed. I think I counted 26 murders in the film, but others have stated that they counted 28.BACK TO THE ACTION:After bumping off his boss Lovo, with the aid of henceman Guino Rinaldo [George Raft], Camonte took up with Lovo's mistress, Poppy [Karen Morley]. Though he has lusted after Poppy from the start, Tony has shown oddly incestuous interest in his own sister, Cesca [Ann Dvorak] that seemed more emotionally deep than that for his newly found trophy girl. There were hints about the incestuous nature of their relationship throughout the film with their mother, who Tony never implied was anything more than a domestic servant, constantly warning Cesca about Tony's intentions in veiled but unmistakable language.Believe it or not, there is actually humor woven into ""Scarface"" throughout, with one of the best examples being the murder of Gaffney, [Boris Karloff] while he was bowling. The camera pans to Gaffney's bowling ball knocking down all the pins which is a strike, and one of the many examples of the ""X"" being used to indicate a murder being committed throughout the film. This reduced the explicitness of the violence, but was perhaps more effective and thought provoking through the implicitly clear outcome.In the end, Camonte got what he had coming and took it like a weasel, which was required by the censors, but it also removed the romanticism that frequently was given to the many violent criminals of the day, especially Capone. His sister died with him, actually before him. At which point he became a defeated man, ready to throw in the towel, but not before he provided proof that he was no hero and unworthy of anyone's respect, which the police had told us to expect.ABOUT THE TONE OF THE FILM AND ITS TIME:Hughes had all kinds of problems with the censors of the day, and we are told that two versions of the film were released. One without the censors approval and one with. Also, that a moral prologue had to be added at the beginning of the film, and added several times during it, to make clear that this was a bad thing we were seeing, [the ruthless life of a killer] and that it was not okay to emulate. In essence, to make clear that the message of the film was NOT to encourage this kind of lifestyle.MY TAKE ON THE MESSAGE:To me, the lead character, Tony Camonte, is a vicious swine whose courage came in the form of a gun in his hand. His lusts' and interests' were both perverted and dispicable, making him an unsympathetic character, and a blight in any civilized society. Good - because that is how he was meant to be seen. That, in no way, diminishes the potency of this film. Instead it punctuates and highlights the right from the wrong, the good from the bad. We may not be sure what the good and right is, after seeing this film, but we can be sure what is bad and wrong, because we have seen it for 93 minutes by the time the film ends.-----*- PRINCIPAL ACTORS -*Paul Muni - Tony CamonteAnn Dvorak - Cesca CamonteKaren Morley - PoppyGeorge Raft - Guino RinaldoBoris Karloff - GaffneyOsgood Perkins - Johnny Lovo-----*- PRODUCTION CREW -*Howard Hawks - Director / Producer / ScreenwriterHoward R.

On VHS, the video quality was variable, but it was watchable from beginning to end. The sound was even better, with very little of the background hiss that we can expect from a 74 year old film.The DVD plays in all-regions, and plays like a new version of the video edition, but with several scenes that seem longer. It seems to have a cleaner video transfer, but that could be because the video I have was not new when I got it, and DVDs retain their playing quality, as long as they are undamaged, unlike VHSs, that degrade over time unless they are never played and hermetically sealed. Naturally, that isn't the way it is, so an equal DVD is a better way to go, especially since the price differential is minute, at this time.BOTTOM LINE: IMPLICIT VIOLENCE & BRUTALITY DONE TO PERFECTIONAn excellent film and an excellent companion for the more recent remake of Scarface,1983, Directed by Brian De Palma and starring Al Pacino. When one recalls that Scarface was made in 1932, before film-noir, and actually during prohibition [1920-1933] it reminds us of what a gem this ""talky"" is. In the end, this talky shines, by showing rather than telling us, what life was like for and around Scarface, and showing, though more challenging to execute, is always the best way to tell a story.",5,IMPLICIT VIOLENCE AND BRUTALITY DONE TO PERFECTION,1143417600,"03 27, 2006",2006,5567,"['TALKY', 'THAT', 'CARRIES', 'QUITE', 'A', 'WALLOP', '99', 'MINUTES', 'A', 'NUTSHELL', 'GLAMORIZING',

883031,A2GZKMS2ZZKQLV,B0007MHPPO,"R. K. Storey ""rkstorey""","[4, 4]","This original version holds up reasonably well.  It manages to depict the ruthlessness of organized crime but suffers slightly from characterizations which one can only presume became cliches afterward.  But perhaps the greatest value this film provides is a snapshot of a particular time without the haze of romanticism that today's gangster films add.Before the story begins, an opening statement is made regarding what we are about to see.  It is, warns the film, an indictment of gang warfare and of ""your"" government's ineffectiveness in combating such lethal street fighting.  It raises the question of what you, the viewer, are doing to stop the mob rule.  Although based on a novel, the film states that all the incidences are real.  In 2006 - unfortunately - such opening statements remind one of over-the-top morality tales such as ""Reefer Madness"".  Further proselityzing occurs about two-thirds into the film when a newspaper editor declares that martial law should be enacted as has been in other states for lesser offenses than gang warfare.  He further goes on to state that the government cannot enforce laws that do not exist, i.e. gun control laws at a minimum.  Considering the controversy over gun control today, one could consider this film ahead of its time.  It is also chilling to see a film espouse so strongly a violation of civil liberties and anti-foreign suspicion.Muni plays Tony as a street-wise but uneducated thug with ambitions greater than those of his boss, Johnny Lovo.  His mannerisms are gruff, and he applies a strong accent.  Tony's mother is - alas - the caricature of a wounded immigrant mother who laments the ways of her wicked son.  His sister, Cesca, is rebellious and resents Tony's over-protectiveness.  Most notably, she lacks any foreign accent.  George Raft's character is actually tougher than Tony:  he is far more aloof and level-headed.  Osgood Perkins' Lovo is actually rather weasely and nervous, which is such a contrast to what modern viewers may be used to.Cinematically the film really delivers.  Despite some heavy symbolism (far too many ""X"" shots mirroring Tony's scar), the atmosphere is appropriately dark and dangerous.  Although clearly set-bound, the chaos of a large city is evident.  The direction is likewise successful.  Enemies are dispatched quickly and without prolonged speeches.  No blather about ""honor"" and ""family"", just the lust for power.  No stylized violence, no sociological rationalization of their behavior.  Its gritty action outweighs some of the (very few) cornier aspects of the tale.To summarize, this old black & white cautionary film is the first gangster movie that has ever given me nightmares.",4,"Would you believe this is a ""message"" movie?",1136678400,"01 8, 2006",2006,2692,"['original', 'version', 'up', 'reasonably', 'well', 'depict', 'ruthlessness', 'organized', 'crime', 'suffers', 'slightly', 'characterizations', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'presume', 'became', 'cliches', 'afterward', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'value', 'film', 'snapshot', 'particular', 'time', 'haze', 'romanticism', 'today', 'gangster', 'films', 'story', 'opening', 'statement', 'made', 'regarding', 'what', 'are', 'see', 'film', 'indictment', 'gang', 'warfare', 'government', 'ineffectiveness', 'combating', 'such', 'lethal', 'street', 'fighting', 'question', 'what', 'viewer', 'are', 'doing', 'stop', 'mob', 'rule', 'based', 'novel', 'film', 'states', 'incidences', 'are', 'real', '2006', 'unfortunately', 'such', 'opening', 'statements', 'remind', 'one', 'over-the-top', 'morality', 'tales', 'such', 'Reefer', 'Madness', 'Further', 'proselityzing', 'two-thirds', 'film', 'when', 'newspaper', 'editor', 'martial', 'law', 'should', 'be', 'enacted', 'been', 'other', 'states', 'lesser', 'offenses', 'gang', 'warfare', 'further', 'state', 'government', 'can', 'not', 'enforce', 'laws', 'do', 'not', 'exist', 'i.e', 'gun', 'control', 'laws', 'minimum', 'Considering', 'controversy', 'gun', 'control', 'today', 'one', 'could', 'consider', 'film', 'ahead', 'time', 'also', 'chilling', 'see', 'film', 'espouse', 'so', 'strongly', 'violation', 'civil', 'liberties', 'anti-foreign', 'suspicion.Muni', 'plays', 'Tony', 'street-wise', 'uneducated', 'thug', 'ambitions', 'greater', 'boss', 'Johnny', 'Lovo', 'mannerisms', 'are', 'gruff', 'strong', 'accent', 'Tony', 'mother', 'alas', 'caricature', 'wounded', 'immigrant', 'mother', 'who', 'ways', 'wicked', 'son', 'sister', 'Cesca', 'rebellious', 'resents', 'Tony', 'over-protectiveness', 'Most', 'notably', 'foreign', 'accent', 'George', 'Raft', 'character', 'actually', 'tougher', 'Tony', 'far', 'more', 'aloof', 'level-headed', 'Osgood', 'Perkins', 'Lovo', 'actually', 'rather', 'weasely', 'nervous', 'contrast', 'what', 'modern', 'viewers', 'may', 'be', 'used', 'to.Cinematically', 'film', 'really', 'delivers', 'heavy', 'symbolism', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'X', 'shots', 'mirroring', 'Tony', 'scar', 'atmosphere', 'appropriately', 'dark', 'dangerous', 'clearly', 'set-bound', 'chaos', 'large', 'city', 'evident', 'direction', 'likewise', 'successful', 'Enemies', 'are', 'dispatched', 'quickly', 'prolonged', 'speeches', 'blather', 'honor', 'family', 'just', 'lust', 'power', 'stylized', 'violence', 'sociological', 'rationalization', 'behavior', 'gritty', 'action', 'very', 'few', 'cornier', 'aspects', 'tale.To', 'summarize', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'cautionary', 'film', 'first', 'gangster', 'movie', 'ever', 'given', 'nightmares']",SCAREFACE/ dvd

This may well be- true... At the time, however, there was much publicity to suggest that ""Scarface"" was the Capone story - which it certainly wasn't...It was a very good, exciting gangster film, and it stands up well when viewed today, more than 70 years on...Paul Muni gave a great performance as Tony Camonte, the scarred gang-leader, but it bears little resemblance to Capone as he really was... Camonte is tough, ruthless, a handy man with a gun and - at the end - a figure hysterically afraid of death as he battles it out with police from his steel-shuttered fortress...Capone was certainly tough and ruthless, but he tried to avoid gunplay himself and employed others to do his dirty work... He was not cowardly, and he did not die in battle...""Scarface""should be seen and remembered as a film devised to exploit the Chicago of its day - and it must be remembered that Chicago gang wars made front-page banner headlines all over the world... It is the story of a battle for power between two gangster figures: Tony Camonte and Gaffney, played by Boris Karloff... A secondary plot hinges on Camonte's strength of feeling for his sister, Cesca (Ann Dvorak), and the romance between Cesca and Camonte's henchman, Guino Rinaldo (George Raft).Eventually Camonte kills Rinaldo in the belief that he has violated Cesca - though the pair are actually married... This is the famous scene in which Rinaldo, whose trademark throughout the picture is his constant flipping and catching of a gold coin, drops out of picture as he dies... and the coin this time falls to the floor...Gaffney, the rival gang-leader, is sometimes likened to Edward ""Spike"" O'Donnell, with whom Capone fought a war for control of the Chicago South Side...In the film, however, the Gaffney character is totally unlike the real Spike, who was a rough-and-ready criminal of Irish descent with a tendency towards practical jokes... He and his three brothers, Steve, Walter and Tommy, did just about everything in their time, from bank robberies to strike-breaking, with a little pick-pocketing on the side... ""Spike"" was a devout Catholic who attended services regularly... yet his most-quoted remark is: ""When arguments fail - use a black-jack.""",3,"""Scarface"" is most often brought up in discussions on the gangster movie...",1168560000,"01 12, 2007",2007,2489,"['Scarface', 'film', 'Thirties', 'most', 'often', 'brought', 'up', 'discussions', 'gangster', 'movie', 'According', 'Hawks', 'directed', 'Scarface', 'idea', 'telling', 'story', 'Capone', 'family', 'were', 'Borgias', 'living', 'Chicago', 'Twenties', 'may', 'well', 'be-', 'true', 'time', 'however', 'was', 'much', 'publicity', 'suggest', 'Scarface', 'was', 'Capone', 'story', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'very', 'good', 'exciting', 'gangster', 'film', 'up', 'well', 'when', 'viewed', 'today', 'more', '70', 'years', 'Paul', 'Muni', 'gave', 'great', 'performance', 'Tony', 'Camonte', 'scarred', 'gang-leader', 'little', 'resemblance', 'Capone', 'really', 'was', 'Camonte', 'tough', 'ruthless', 'handy', 'man', 'gun', 'end', 'figure', 'hysterically', 'afraid', 'death', 'out', 'police', 'steel-shuttered', 'fortress', 'Capone', 'was', 'certainly', 'tough', 'ruthless', 'tried', 'avoid', 'gunplay', 'employed', 'others', 'do', 'dirty', 'work', 'was', 'not', 'cowardly', 'did', 'not', 'die', 'battle', 'Scarface', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'remembered', 'film', 'devised', 'exploit', 'Chicago', 'day', 'must', 'be', 'remembered', 'Chicago', 'gang', 'wars', 'made', 'front-page', 'banner', 'headlines', 'world', 'story', 'battle', 'power', 'two', 'gangster', 'figures', 'Tony', 'Camonte', 'Gaffney', 'played', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'secondary', 'plot', 'hinges', 'Camonte', 'strength', 'feeling', 'sister', 'Cesca', 'Ann', 'Dvorak', 'romance', 'Cesca', 'Camonte', 'henchman', 'Guino', 'Rinaldo', 'George', 'Raft', '.Eventually', 'Camonte', 'kills', 'Rinaldo', 'belief', 'violated', 'Cesca', 'pair', 'are', 'actually', 'married', 'famous', 'scene', 'Rinaldo', 'trademark', 'picture', 'constant', 'flipping', 'catching', 'gold', 'coin', 'picture', 'coin', 'time', 'floor', 'Gaffney', 'rival', 'gang-leader', 'sometimes', 'likened', 'Edward', 'Spike', ""O'Donnell"", 'whom', 'Capone', 'fought', 'war', 'control', 'Chicago', 'South', 'Side', 'film', 'however', 'Gaffney', 'character', 'totally', 'real', 'Spike', 'who', 'was', 'rough-and-ready', 'criminal', 'Irish', 'descent', 'tendency', 'towards', 'practical', 'jokes', 'three', 'brothers', 'Steve', 'Walter', 'Tommy', 'did', 'just', 'everything', 'time', 'bank', 'robberies', 'strike-breaking', 'little', 'pick-pocketing', 'side', 'Spike', 'was', 'devout', 'Catholic', 'who', 'attended', 'services', 'regularly', 'yet', 'most-quoted', 'remark', 'When', 'arguments', 'fail', 'use', 'black-jack']",SCAREFACE/ dvd
