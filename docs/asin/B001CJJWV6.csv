Capturing history on film is a rare thing, and capturing it with incredible sound is even more so.  This is without a doubt a must see for any Hendrix fan, diehard or casual.  The performance is phenomenal, and the picture and sound - especially the sound, are excellent.  The film -especially the interviews - is really illuminating for someone like myself who had heard the performance on CD for years, but had not actually seen the entire performance or knew the story behind the Festival.  Again, a really amazing document captured here.  I don't believe the entire Festival is available yet on BluRay, but when it is I'd love to have it.  Of course it might seem anticlimactic since it appears that only a handful of performances could even light a candle to Hendrix.",5,Outstanding!,1241136000,"05 1, 2009",2009,884,"['wish', 'were', 'more', 'quality', 'documents', 'amazing', 'time', 'are', 'unfortunately', 'few', 'far', 'Capturing', 'history', 'film', 'rare', 'thing', 'capturing', 'incredible', 'sound', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'doubt', 'must', 'see', 'Hendrix', 'fan', 'diehard', 'casual', 'performance', 'phenomenal', 'picture', 'sound', 'especially', 'sound', 'are', 'excellent', 'film', '-especially', 'interviews', 'really', 'illuminating', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'heard', 'performance', 'CD', 'years', 'had', 'not', 'actually', 'seen', 'entire', 'performance', 'knew', 'story', 'Festival', 'Again', 'really', 'amazing', 'document', 'captured', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'entire', 'Festival', 'available', 'yet', 'BluRay', 'when', ""'d"", 'love', 'have', 'course', 'might', 'seem', 'anticlimactic', 'only', 'handful', 'performances', 'could', 'even', 'light', 'candle', 'Hendrix']",N/A

I had already purchased the regular DVD version of this feature so I hoped the Blu Ray version would surpass that. I was very mistaken.  Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought Blu Ray technology equals true HD which, if I'm not mistaken, should be in wide-screen format, right?  Well, Jimi's whole Monterey performance is presented here with those annoying black-bars and either side of my HD wide-screen tv. Trust me, it's not the settings on my tv.  It's simply the way that the film is presented on this ""blu ray"" disc.  A total rip-off.  Am I missing something here?
