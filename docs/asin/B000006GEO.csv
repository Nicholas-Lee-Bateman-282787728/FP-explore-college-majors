AvildsenC: Christopher Atkins, Lesley Ann Warren, Robert Logan, Deney Terrio, Deborah Rush, Sandra Beall, Alix Elias, Carrie Snodgress, Andy Garc&iacute;aP: A teacher (Warren), bored with her marriage, has a one night stand with one of her students (Atkins) after discovering that he is moonlighting as a stripper.Sometimes in order to fully understand a movie, you got to understand the film's history. In 1983, teen films were dominating the market. The film My Tutor, about a French teacher who sleeps with one of her students, was released to great commercial success in March of 1983.On the surface, A Night in Heaven looks like it has all the right ingredients - a cast of considerable talent, a screenplay by Joan Tewkesbury of Nashville fame and director John G. Avildsen (Rocky, The Karate Kid, Save the Tiger) at the helm.Watching the film, it seems that the people behind it wanted to make a thoughtful examination into various relationships and how each of those relationships affect one another. However, judging from the film's brief running time and a noticeable absence of key scenes, it seems as though someone at 20th Century Fox got cold feet and had the film hastily re-edited at the last minute in order to make it something more marketable along the lines of My Tutor.The final product plays up more to the film's erotic elements and the soundtrack. The marketing tried to make it seem like a cross between My Tutor and Saturday Night Fever.Judging the film in front of me, Lesley Ann Warren turns in a fine performance. The scene in which Warren discovers that Christopher Atkins is moonlighting as the star attraction at a strip club is erotically effective. There are a few sincere moments that come across here and there and the film poses a lot of intriguing notions involving love, fidelity, class conflict, materialism, statements on war, alcoholism and notions involving its a dog eat dog world out there.There's an interesting juxtaposition involving Atkins who sells his body and, in the process, his soul for money. On the other hand, Warren's husband (played by Robert Logan) quits his job as a prominent engineer, because he doesn't want to help in the production of missiles that could possibly become instruments of war. At the end of the day, he has to be able to look at himself in the mirror.Atkins, who tried to branch out and do something different, stars as a college student stuck living in a trailer park with his mom. He doesn't want to end up like her, working a dead end job as a waitress at a small town coffee shop. So he uses the one thing he's got, his body, to use anyone and everyone that can help him escape his troubling predicament. In a cruel twist of fate, in which art imitated life, Atkins was used strictly just for his body. Any depth or character development involving his role was left on the editing room floor.A Night in Heaven asks a lot of questions about humanity and our existence in the world, but most of those questions are left unanswered. Large chunks of the film appear missing. I can easily imagine that this is not the film that the people behind this film intended to make. Sex plays a role in this film, as it does in any adult's life. Whoever edited the final product and/or the suits who were in charge of the film's marketing, couldn't see past the sex. Who knows how this film would have turned out if the people behind it had been allowed to present their initial vision of this film, but I can't imagine it being any worse then the film in front of me. Whether the film had been a hit or a flop in its original form, whether it had been a hit with critics or not, at least it would have been more representative of what everyone set out to initially accomplish.

494173,A14JEURPY1CXZB,B000006GEO,James D. Leverton,"[12, 16]","""A Night in Heaven"" opened in 1983 to terrible reviews and even worse box office.  It was a mainstay on ten worst lists everywhere.  It was dubbed ""Flashdunce"" after another hit movie of that year.Really, its not that bad.  Insubstantial, yes.  Ill-conceived, yes.  Entertaining?  Quite.Lesley Anne Warren plays Faye, a speech professor at the local community college who is having marital problems.  Her husband Whitney (Robert Logan), an emotionally stunted inventor, has seemingly lost interest in her and she is becoming depressed when her sister Patsy (Deborah Rush) takes her out with friends to a local strip club.  There, Faye is surprised that the club's star stripper, Ricky the Rocket (Christopher Atkins), is the same cocky student she just flunked in her class.  When he sees her in the audience, Ricky does a virtual lapdance for her, and it isn't long before they have plunged into an affair.Actually, there was probably a very good, serious film buried somewhere in writer Joan Tewkesbury's original script, which is glossily directed by Oscar-winner John G. Avildsen, who went from this fiasco to ""The Karate Kid"".  Unfortunately, the casting of Christopher Atkins in what was obviously originally a supporting role hurts the film considerably.  Cast after his breakthrough role in ""The Blue Lagoon"", Atkins received star billing and all of the film's pre-release publicity.  But Warren and Logan are the lead characters, have most of the screen time and obviously have the main relationship in the film.  This caused the film to be quite obviously heavily reedited to emphasize the Atkins character, who is a total jerk, completely amoral and unlikable, and poorly played by one of the worst actors ever to be spit out of the Hollywood system.  This sinks the film faster than the ""Titanic"".  As a result, what should have been a serious examination of a marriage at a crossroads becomes a smarmy sex-comedy/marital drama in which the disparate elements just don't fit.  Note the brief 80 minute running time.  This is one film which I wish could be reedited to a director's cut, so we can see what the writer and director's original intent was.  Instead, we will forever be saddled with the studio's botched reedit.In spite of all this, ""A Night in Heaven"" remains entertaining and easy to watch.  Lesley Ann Warren gives a good performance here, although I'm sure this film isn't listed on her otherwise stellar resume.  Robert Logan is also quite good, although his presence is a bit of an eye-opener considering he is best-known for family films like ""The Wilderness Family"" and this film comes as close to soft-core porn as any major Hollywood studio film of recent decades.  Deborah Rush gives able support, and there's a decent performance here by an actress named Sandra Beall as Ricky's long-suffering girlfriend Slick.  The late Carrie Snodgress also has a couple of good scenes as Ricky's mother.  Unfortunately, Atkins' horrible acting just about negates the performances of everyone around him.  It's impossible to do excellent work when the person you are acting with can't act to save his life.  It makes you appreciate Warren's work even more.  That she manages to give a good performance under the circumstances is commendable.One note:  This film contains one of the sexiest love scenes I have ever seen in a film, and is one of only three reasons to see it.  The other two?  Warren's performance and Bryan Adams' now-classic love them ""Heaven"", which plays in its entirety over the opening and closing credits.  When you take away the seven minutes for these sequences, that leaves 73 minutes of story, which makes the cuts even more noticeable.""A Night in Heaven"" is one bomb from the early '80's that should have been much better, but remains more entertaining than many much better films of the era.**1/2 (out of *****);  ** for execution; *** for entertainment value.",2,Not as bad as its reputation,1123027200,"08 3, 2005",2005,3908,"['Night', 'Heaven', 'opened', '1983', 'terrible', 'reviews', 'even', 'worse', 'box', 'office', 'was', 'mainstay', 'ten', 'worst', 'lists', 'everywhere', 'was', 'dubbed', 'Flashdunce', 'hit', 'movie', 'year.Really', 'not', 'bad', 'Insubstantial', 'yes', 'Ill-conceived', 'yes', 'Entertaining', 'Quite.Lesley', 'Anne', 'Warren', 'Faye', 'speech', 'professor', 'local', 'community', 'college', 'who', 'having', 'marital', 'problems', 'husband', 'Whitney', 'Robert', 'Logan', 'emotionally', 'stunted', 'inventor', 'seemingly', 'lost', 'interest', 'becoming', 'depressed', 'when', 'sister', 'Patsy', 'Deborah', 'Rush', 'out', 'friends', 'local', 'strip', 'club', 'Faye', 'surprised', 'club', 'star', 'stripper', 'Ricky', 'Rocket', 'Christopher', 'Atkins', 'same', 'cocky', 'student', 'just', 'flunked', 'class', 'When', 'audience', 'Ricky', 'virtual', 'lapdance', ""n't"", 'long', 'have', 'plunged', 'affair.Actually', 'was', 'probably', 'very', 'good', 'serious', 'film', 'buried', 'somewhere', 'writer', 'Joan', 'Tewkesbury', 'original', 'script', 'glossily', 'directed', 'Oscar-winner', 'John', 'G.', 'Avildsen', 'who', 'went', 'fiasco', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'Unfortunately', 'casting', 'Christopher', 'Atkins', 'what', 'was', 'obviously', 'originally', 'supporting', 'role', 'film', 'considerably', 'Cast', 'breakthrough', 'role', 'Blue', 'Lagoon', 'Atkins', 'received', 'star', 'billing', 'film', 'pre-release', 'publicity', 'Warren', 'Logan', 'are', 'lead', 'characters', 'have', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'obviously', 'have', 'main', 'relationship', 'film', 'caused', 'film', 'be', 'quite', 'obviously', 'heavily', 'reedited', 'emphasize', 'Atkins', 'character', 'who', 'total', 'jerk', 'completely', 'amoral', 'unlikable', 'poorly', 'played', 'one', 'worst', 'actors', 'ever', 'be', 'spit', 'Hollywood', 'system', 'film', 'faster', 'Titanic', 'result', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'serious', 'examination', 'marriage', 'crossroads', 'smarmy', 'sex-comedy/marital', 'drama', 'disparate', 'elements', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'Note', 'brief', '80', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'one', 'film', 'wish', 'could', 'be', 'reedited', 'director', 'cut', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'writer', 'director', 'original', 'intent', 'was', 'Instead', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'saddled', 'studio', 'botched', 'reedit.In', 'spite', 'Night', 'Heaven', 'entertaining', 'easy', 'watch', 'Lesley', 'Ann', 'Warren', 'good', 'performance', 'here', ""'m"", 'sure', 'film', ""n't"", 'listed', 'otherwise', 'stellar', 'resume', 'Robert', 'Logan', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'presence', 'bit', 'eye-opener', 'considering', 'best-known', 'family', 'films', 'Wilderness', 'Family', 'film', 'as', 'close', 'soft-core', 'porn', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'studio', 'film', 'recent', 'decades', 'Deborah', 'Rush', 'able', 'support', 'decent', 'performance', 'here', 'actress', 'named', 'Sandra', 'Beall', 'Ricky', 'long-suffering', 'girlfriend', 'Slick', 'late', 'Carrie', 'Snodgress', 'also', 'couple', 'good', 'scenes', 'Ricky', 'mother', 'Unfortunately', 'Atkins', 'horrible', 'acting', 'just', 'negates', 'performances', 'everyone', 'impossible', 'do', 'excellent', 'work', 'when', 'person', 'are', 'acting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'save', 'life', 'appreciate', 'Warren', 'work', 'even', 'more', 'give', 'good', 'performance', 'circumstances', 'commendable.One', 'note', 'film', 'one', 'sexiest', 'love', 'scenes', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'one', 'only', 'three', 'reasons', 'see', 'other', 'two', 'Warren', 'performance', 'Bryan', 'Adams', 'now-classic', 'Heaven', 'entirety', 'opening', 'closing', 'credits', 'When', 'take', 'away', 'seven', 'minutes', 'sequences', '73', 'minutes', 'story', 'cuts', 'even', 'more', 'noticeable', 'Night', 'Heaven', 'one', 'bomb', 'early', ""'80"", 'should', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'more', 'entertaining', 'many', 'much', 'better', 'films', 'era', '**1/2', '*****', '**', 'execution', '***', 'entertainment', 'value']",A Night in Heaven VHS
