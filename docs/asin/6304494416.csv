There were a few  things I didn't like, though.  I didn't like the woman who cared about her  car, she was a jerk.  And when Ernest made that Yo-Yo the &quot;Eyes&quot;  he made it out of became a compleatly different shape.  And Ostrich eggs  don't break that easily (you can stand on one and it still wouldn't  break!).

425922,A4H4KYSM2KQ85,6304494416,Erika Mitchell,"[7, 8]","In this film, Ernest wants a date with Renee, the waitress at a local diner.  She considers herself to deserve more than this Mr. Nobody.  At the advice of the other waitress, Ernest tries to win Renee's heart with a gift.  Unfortunately, while shopping for the gift, he gets mixed up in a jewel theft involving stolen African treasure.  That lands both Renee and Ernest in Africa, where they must try to evade capture by competing teams of jewel thieves.  While in Africa, Ernest gets to try out an extended scene with the old lady in the green dress, and he does a masterful job as an Indian swami.The first time I saw this movie, I thought it lacked continuity. I found it somewhat strange to see Indians, Arabs, and Brits mixed in with the African characters, and I thought that Varney had gotten his geography thoroughly confused this time.  I also found the stereotypes that he was playing with a bit offensive- -many of the characters certainly aren't politically correct.  However, after seeing the film again after living years in the Middle East, I can now recognize the characters easily, and they are incredibly realistic and very funny indeed.  Varney must have spent some time in East Africa before making this film.  While he was there, he no doubt visited an Arabic palace in Zanzibar, had some run-ins with Indian servants and British hunters, and met some friendly tribesmen who taught him some key phrases in a Bantu language.  Unlike some of Ernest's more kid-centered movies, this film doesn't have a moral theme.  It's just Ernest on safari.",4,Almost realistic,1026777600,"07 16, 2002",2002,1563,"['film', 'Ernest', 'date', 'Renee', 'waitress', 'local', 'diner', 'deserve', 'more', 'Mr.', 'Nobody', 'advice', 'other', 'waitress', 'Ernest', 'win', 'Renee', 'heart', 'gift', 'Unfortunately', 'shopping', 'gift', 'mixed', 'up', 'jewel', 'theft', 'involving', 'stolen', 'African', 'treasure', 'Renee', 'Ernest', 'Africa', 'where', 'must', 'try', 'evade', 'capture', 'competing', 'teams', 'jewel', 'thieves', 'Africa', 'Ernest', 'try', 'out', 'extended', 'scene', 'old', 'lady', 'green', 'dress', 'masterful', 'job', 'Indian', 'swami.The', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'thought', 'lacked', 'continuity', 'found', 'somewhat', 'strange', 'see', 'Indians', 'Arabs', 'Brits', 'mixed', 'African', 'characters', 'thought', 'Varney', 'had', 'gotten', 'geography', 'thoroughly', 'confused', 'time', 'also', 'found', 'stereotypes', 'was', 'playing', 'bit', 'offensive-', '-many', 'characters', 'certainly', 'are', ""n't"", 'politically', 'correct', 'However', 'seeing', 'film', 'again', 'living', 'years', 'Middle', 'East', 'can', 'now', 'recognize', 'characters', 'easily', 'are', 'incredibly', 'realistic', 'very', 'funny', 'indeed', 'Varney', 'must', 'have', 'spent', 'time', 'East', 'Africa', 'making', 'film', 'was', 'there', 'doubt', 'visited', 'Arabic', 'palace', 'Zanzibar', 'had', 'run-ins', 'Indian', 'servants', 'British', 'hunters', 'met', 'friendly', 'tribesmen', 'who', 'taught', 'key', 'phrases', 'Bantu', 'language', 'Ernest', 'more', 'kid-centered', 'movies', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'moral', 'theme', 'just', 'Ernest', 'safari']",Ernest Goes to Africa VHS

If you like Ernest, it doesn't matter what the movie is about, it's funny.  Oh, and I would ad, as funny as Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) when I compare Ernest to him, I have to give Ernest a higher goofy silliness score.

Yes, they are silly and whatnot but they were always funny and I can't think of another actor who can make such funny faces. Unfortunately, in this one the budget was seemed to have been kept to a maximum of about 200 bucks. It's very low budget and it was dissappointing to see Ernest in something so stupid.The story was cheesy, flimsy, and stupid. The actors (excluding Ernest himself) were horrible, and it was altogether just cheesy. Ernest also wasn't very funny in this one at all. His co-star, that dumb waitress who goes along with Ernest to Africa was so mean and stupid I just wanted to slap her across the face.
