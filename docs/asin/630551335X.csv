This is an incredibly strong return to directing for Hopper. You can feel his need to make films in every shot. The disc comes with a powerful trailer, a radio spot, and a running commentary by Hopper and the film's producers. Much like Hopper's commentary for Easy Rider, Out Of The Blue is no treat. Hopper seems to get lost watching his films. He has to constantly be prodded to talk. I am under the impression that he feels that both films speak for themselves and to elaborate further somehow demeans his work. Instead of giving us background information he gives a play by play of what we are watching. Aside from that this DVD is a very welcome part of my collection. By all means avoid the Gemstone release of this film. It is the worst edition of Out Of The Blue I have ever seen.",5,Out Of The Blue Finally Given Its Due,995760000,"07 22, 2001",2001,916,"['great', 'finally', 'see', 'gorgeous', 'transfer', 'film', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'done', 'splendid', 'job', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'return', 'directing', 'Hopper', 'can', 'feel', 'need', 'make', 'films', 'shot', 'disc', 'powerful', 'trailer', 'radio', 'spot', 'running', 'commentary', 'Hopper', 'film', 'producers', 'Much', 'Hopper', 'commentary', 'Easy', 'Rider', 'Out', 'Blue', 'treat', 'Hopper', 'get', 'lost', 'watching', 'films', 'constantly', 'be', 'prodded', 'talk', 'am', 'impression', 'films', 'speak', 'elaborate', 'further', 'somehow', 'work', 'Instead', 'giving', 'background', 'information', 'play', 'play', 'what', 'are', 'watching', 'Aside', 'DVD', 'very', 'welcome', 'part', 'collection', 'means', 'avoid', 'Gemstone', 'release', 'film', 'worst', 'edition', 'Out', 'Blue', 'have', 'ever', 'seen']",Out of the Blue

I found this to be a fascinating directoral effort by Dennis Hopper who maintains a  real sense of despair throughout - his acting is superb as usual as well.  I've heard from many that Linda Manz's performance was the highlight, but I  felt her delivery of much of the dialogue was too stiff - still, much  better than most young actors handed such a role.  Overall, you leave the  film feeling as if there's something missing - the climax is late in the  film and its resolution is ultimately unsatisfactory.  Additional interplay  between Manz's character and her parents, especially Hopper, would've  strengthened the film a great deal.  Still, well worth watching and it  sticks with you after you've finished.  And as usual, a marvelous transfer  from Anchor Bay.",3,Nice piece of cinema,959299200,"05 26, 2000",2000,905,"['Bought', 'having', 'never', 'heard', 'solely', 'recommendation', 'friend', 'trusting', 'quality', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'DVD', 'found', 'be', 'fascinating', 'directoral', 'effort', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'who', 'real', 'sense', 'despair', 'acting', 'superb', 'as', 'usual', 'well', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'many', 'Linda', 'Manz', 'performance', 'was', 'highlight', 'felt', 'delivery', 'much', 'dialogue', 'was', 'too', 'stiff', 'still', 'much', 'better', 'most', 'young', 'actors', 'handed', 'role', 'Overall', 'leave', 'film', 'feeling', 'something', 'missing', 'climax', 'late', 'film', 'resolution', 'ultimately', 'unsatisfactory', 'Additional', 'interplay', 'Manz', 'character', 'parents', 'especially', 'Hopper', 'would', ""'ve"", 'strengthened', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'Still', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', ""'ve"", 'finished', 'usual', 'marvelous', 'transfer', 'Anchor', 'Bay']",Out of the Blue

468017,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,630551335X,Richard Ross,"[7, 10]","When we first see Cebe Barnes (Linda Manz) she seems to be a normal girl enjoying a happy childhood. She wears clown makeup and sits on her dad's lap as he drives her to school on a rainy day. Our preconceptions are shattered however after we witness her father (Dennis Hopper) hand her his empty beer bottle so that he can pop some pills. While he's getting high he loses control of his vehicle and plows into an oncoming school bus killing dozens of children and sending him to jail for 8 years. This is only the first scene. Things can only get darker from here and believe me they do.While her father sits in jail, Cebe is left to fend for herself. Her mother is no help since she spends her days sleeping with her boss and her nights shooting up with Hopper's pals and sleeping with them too. A pissed off Cebe, hating school and her home life, dreams of nothing more than to escape from it all. She hitchhikes all over Vancouver winding up at punk rock concerts where she feeds off the anger and energy of the crowd. A product of her parents Cebe loves to get high and start fights. There is a terrifying scene midway through the film where a passed out Cebe, after shooting up, almost gets raped by a john who picked her up and brought her back to his drug pad. The camera pans over to a stoned woman in lingerie watching all this as it happens. Cebe is a huge Elvis fan and has built a shrine to him in her room. It's safe to say she looks up to the King as much as she does her father since their pictures are side by side.  Cebe dreams of him coming home and reconciling with her mother. She longs for things to go back to normal (or as normal as this life sadly must seem to someone living it). After Hopper is finally released from jail he has a hard time re-adjusting to life on the outside. He doesn't seem all that shocked to learn his wife's drug use has intensified since he's been away or the fact that she's sleeping with his best friend (Don Gordon). He joins the two of them in getting high. Being addicts, their relationship is built on paranoia and an uncontrollable urge to score. Their fighting turns physical and soon not even Cebe is safe from her dad's wrath. Making matters worse is the fact that the parents of the dead children from the bus crash show up at Hopper's door intent on making him pay for his crimes. Some of the stuff that happens is among the most shocking and disturbing I've ever seen in a film. The last 30 minutes in particular are too horrifying to think about yet once seen it'll stay etched in your memory for a long time.Hopper does an amazing job as both actor and director. He rubs viewers faces right in the nastiness. We become unwilling participants in the downward spiral of this family. It doesn't take much imagination to see why this is one of writer/director Harmony Korine's favorite films. (For all of the nastiness in 'KIDS', I found this film far more harrowing). Linda Manz does a phenomenal job bringing this complicated character to life. Cebe is exposed to so much violence and darkness that Manz as an actress has to convincingly sell those feelings of hopelessness and despair. She does so a little too effectively. Probably the only moments of relief come from Raymond Burr who has a small role as a social worker trying to break through to Cebe and help her turn her life around before it's too late.This is one harrowing film experience. It's not pleasant at all nor is it meant to be.  Dennis Hopper deserves a lot of credit for sticking to his vision no matter how disturbing it is.  He first did it in 'Easy Rider' and he does it again here - taking you on an intense journey that you know will end badly yet when it does you're completely shocked and devastated.",3,A Deeply Disturbing Dennis Hopper Movie?
