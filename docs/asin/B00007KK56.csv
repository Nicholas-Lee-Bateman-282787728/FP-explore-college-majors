But I got it for only five dollars, so I can't complain too much.This disc gives the observant viewer a good back-to-back display of the show's jump, from its days as a genuinely funny show to the parody of itself it later became. Don't get me wrong, all five episodes included here are very funny, but sometime in 1990, it derailed, and never fully came back. The two-parter is from 1991, and there is a marked decrease in the quality of the writing and directing in it. In fact, I can pin-point the moment the show derailed. It was the one where the two families went to England, on a bogus prize vacation. That episode isn't on this particular disc, but following the show's run, how it played out, that is precisely when it lost it.I may start getting the seasons as available on Amazon, although I may stop after the third or fourth season. But, completionist I am, I will probably keep getting them, as finances allow.Back to the product at hand.

730366,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B00007KK56,andy8047,"[2, 2]","The most memorable episode on this DVD is ""I'll See You In Court"" from Married...With Children's third season(1988-89). Al(Ed O'Neill) and Peggy Bundy(Katey Sagal) retreat to a motel to try to ""put some spice"" back into their private life. They view a videocassette,recorded by a security camera,of their next-door neighbors Steve(David Garrison) and Marcy Rhoades(Amanda Bearse) engaged in a private escapade. It turns out that the camera violated the Rhoadeses' privacy,when they were at that same motel by themselves at an earlier time. So both couples sue the owners/operators of the motel but only the Rhoadeses were awarded a nice $100 grand because the Bundys' privacy was not invaded afterall. After the trial,Al and Peggy are making love underneath the presiding judge's podium with a security camera overhead! This episode was never aired on the Fox network during its original run because because of some of its content. The FX channel did once air it in 2002,though. In ""You Better Shop Around"",a two-part episode from 1990-91,Al,Peg and their children Kelly(Christina Applegate) and Bud(David Faustino) seek relaxing shelter in a supermarket. Al accidentally wins a sweepstakes by becoming the store one millionth customer of the day. At the time,Al steps ahead of Marcy in the checkout line because he only had a pack of chewing gum. Balloons and confetti are falling and Marcy is bitching because she was originally the next in line. Al quipps,""What's the difference? You still are!"". Al checks out a headline on the cover of the National Enquirer which reads ""Steve Rhoades to marry Cher"". That immediately caught Marcy's attention because he's her ex-husband(this was after Marcy married her second husband Jefferson D'Arcy). The other episodes are awesome.

Married with Children ran for 11 seasons, 10 years, and consists of about 262 episodes!  It also was one of the most popular, influential, and long running sitcoms in TV history!  Fans would jump at the release of a complete season 1 DVD box set, so much that they probably couldn't keep enough of them on the shelf!  So will someone please tell me why our time is being wasted with another dreaded compilation ""best of"" DVD with 5 measley episodes?  Who actually buys these things?  Anyone with enough interest to buy this will without a doubt drool over a Season One set!  Season sets are the only way to go with television shows.  Several great shows have already began being released in season sets such as Baretta, Sanford & Son, All in the Family, The Jeffersons, Fawlty Towers, Mad About You, The Simpsons, The Young Ones, and coming soon - Good Times! So what happened?  These shows have 12-14 episodes in their first seasons and so does Married with Children (13), making it ideal for a 2 disc set!  What really blows me away is what immediately comes out in season or complete sets: shows like Angel, Once & Again, Malcom in the Middle, Buffy, etc. and I'm sorry, but come on...Sports Night? Did anyone watch Sports Night? Why would these lesser and lamer shows get first class complete treatment and a show like Married with Children gets a pointless compilation of 5 episodes, which by the way are picked from Seasons 3, 5, & 8?  Sure they release Friends & Sex and the City in their entirety, but not MWC?  Sorry, I can't complain enough.

Since when are only SOME of the episodes of this magnificent show supposed to be outrageous?This is a seriously bad treatment of a classic - to release a small subset of the real show is not only ridiculous, but an insult to its fanbase. MWC deserves to have all of its episodes (well.. the first six seasons anyway) released, instead of having the suits decide what goes on the dvd based on how much controversy the episode originally generated.Married... With Children is a classic show that keeps getting hosed. It began with Fox treating it like any other show (not THE show that skyrocketed them to fame), followed by a series of events, not the least of which was pulling the plug on the series without even notifying the actors. Needless to say, this is the latest insult - a ""greatest hits"" ""ensemble"".MWC was one of a kind. The original six seasons had what I can only describe as genius writers, combining hilarious observations with biting critique. Every character had philosophy that made them different and unique - like Al's constant tales about the ""Red Grinch that stole Uncle Al's life"", or Kelly's opinion on the usage of the word 'hussy'. Even Marcy, character I personally like the least had her charm, whether it was her El Pollo Loco disposition, or strange, borderline explosive libido.This show deserves better. It deserves to have more than 3 items show up in the Amazon.com search (one of which is a book).

730376,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B00007KK56,Michael Crane,"[25, 25]","First I'd like to say that I certainly understand why all the low ratings for this DVD.  The stars don't go towards the show itself, but more towards the fact that this isn't a complete season and a lot of people were hoping for that.  I understand and I admit I'm disappointed as well.  However, I love the show and have absolutely no problem getting these DVDs for the meantime until they finally (and I know they will at some point) release the entire seasons.Despite the obvious complaints, I was still able to enjoy this collection of Married with Children episodes.  This really brings back the old memories, being that I used to watch this all the time when I was little.  Now it's even more funnier being that I'm older and am now able to understand all of the jokes.  And hey, who couldn't love Al Bundy??  The man rocks!The DVD includes 5 episodes, 1 of them being a lost one that was deemed ""too raunchy"" for TV.  The episodes are as follows:  A Dump of My Own, You Better Shop Around Parts 1 and 2, No Chicken No Check, and I'll see you in Court.  All of them are funny as hell, but my favorites have to be the two shopping episodes where the Bundy Family actually LIVE in the supermarket since it is a MUCH cheaper way of staying cool.  (In fact, I would've paid the price just for those 2 episodes alone!)  But they're all great, as far as I'm concerned.  And they're not in any order, so some of the shows are older while others aren't as old.The DVD really doesn't have much to offer, other than the picture looking very good for being television shows.  There's a few bonus trailers, but even those aren't that spectacular.  And, I wished that they would've included a few more episodes.  5 just isn't enough.All in all, the ""Married with Children Vol. 1"" DVD is a pretty nice package, although it would've been much better if more episodes were included.  Hopefully they will start releasing complete seasons soon.  That really is the way to go.  Again, I understand why the low ratings.  The only reason why I'm not giving it a low rating as well is because I enjoyed it and have no problem of buying the complete seasons when they finally decide to release them.  For now, these will have to do.  If you really want to wait for the seasons to come out, then do so.  I'm sure they will eventually release them.

They have no respect for classics the way that we do.So we have a catch 22 here. Buy it and you are giving in to marketing ploys. Don't buy it and you may be dooming the world's MWC collections to home-recorded television reruns only.In all likelyhood this show, and every show that was ever sucsessfull, will eventually come out in season by season sets.But for now this is what we get (and Most Outrageous Volume 2 is in the works as I write this).As for the disc itself, it does feature very little, but the episodes themselves are well picked.
