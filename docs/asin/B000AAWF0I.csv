925729,A1DI3PU62K8KZ0,B000AAWF0I,Duchess Darcy,"[27, 28]","****** Contains Spoilers ******A true gem of a film. The story of a famous opera singer who suddenly retires from the stage, much to the dismay of his fans and to the delight of his arch enemy. Joachim Dallayrac is at the top of his career when he announces his retirement and retreats to a country home. There he opens up a school but only has one student, a young soprano. He later comes across a young man, who has been caught stealing and also takes him as a student. When his arch enemy, Prince Scotti holds his annual singing contest and invites Dallayrac's students, it is an invitation they cannot refuse and are afraid to accept. Are Prince's Scotti's motives and intentions to destroy the pupils or help them jump start their careers?The cinematography is breathtaking. The country home of Dallayrac seems almost enchanted, secluded in the countryside surrounded by trees, hills, and a scenic lake. The music is outstanding with arias from various operas sung with incredible emotion and sheer simplicity. The final singing duel between Dallayrac's student and Prince Scotti's protege showcases the differences between a true vocal gift and the appearance of one. As Dallayrac explains to his student Jean, years ago he won a singing duel against Prince Scotti not because Dallayrac thought he was the best singer, but because the Prince believed he was.The rigours of training for singers is explored as the music teacher demands absolute concentration and sacrifice from his students. Sophie, the young soprano, laments about the loneliness she feels, but is told she must embrace that loneliness since it will be her companion for much of her life from now own. The sheer beauty of the music and scenery will captivate you into feeling, not just hearing the music. A sheer delight, this film will not disappoint.",5,Absolute Excellence !,1154304000,"07 31, 2006",2006,1825,"['******', 'Spoilers', '******A', 'true', 'gem', 'film', 'story', 'famous', 'opera', 'singer', 'who', 'suddenly', 'stage', 'much', 'dismay', 'fans', 'delight', 'arch', 'enemy', 'Joachim', 'Dallayrac', 'top', 'career', 'when', 'retirement', 'retreats', 'country', 'home', 'up', 'school', 'only', 'one', 'student', 'young', 'soprano', 'later', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'caught', 'stealing', 'also', 'student', 'When', 'arch', 'enemy', 'Prince', 'Scotti', 'annual', 'singing', 'contest', 'Dallayrac', 'students', 'invitation', 'can', 'not', 'refuse', 'are', 'afraid', 'accept', 'Are', 'Prince', 'Scotti', 'motives', 'intentions', 'destroy', 'pupils', 'help', 'jump', 'start', 'careers', 'cinematography', 'breathtaking', 'country', 'home', 'Dallayrac', 'almost', 'enchanted', 'secluded', 'countryside', 'surrounded', 'trees', 'hills', 'scenic', 'lake', 'music', 'outstanding', 'arias', 'various', 'operas', 'sung', 'incredible', 'emotion', 'sheer', 'simplicity', 'final', 'singing', 'duel', 'Dallayrac', 'student', 'Prince', 'Scotti', 'protege', 'differences', 'true', 'vocal', 'gift', 'appearance', 'one', 'Dallayrac', 'student', 'Jean', 'years', 'won', 'singing', 'duel', 'Prince', 'Scotti', 'not', 'Dallayrac', 'thought', 'was', 'best', 'singer', 'Prince', 'believed', 'rigours', 'training', 'singers', 'explored', 'music', 'teacher', 'absolute', 'concentration', 'sacrifice', 'students', 'Sophie', 'young', 'soprano', 'laments', 'loneliness', 'told', 'must', 'embrace', 'loneliness', 'will', 'be', 'companion', 'much', 'life', 'now', 'own', 'sheer', 'beauty', 'music', 'scenery', 'will', 'captivate', 'feeling', 'not', 'just', 'hearing', 'music', 'sheer', 'delight', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'disappoint']",Le Maître de Musique (The Music Teacher)

She doesn't sing, actually, but the dubbing and lip-syncing are so well done that I didn't even know that for several viewings. Yes, I have seen it many times, because in addition to Anne the scenery is also beautiful and the singing is sublime. The eponymous music teacher is played by the great Belgian baritone Jose Van Dam - his singing of Mahler's ""Ich bin der welt abhanden gekommen"" is as good as it (that is, life) gets. The singing competition is pretty obvious, even silly, but it's a small price to pay for what is otherwise a musical gem. It does require a quiet place - there are no car chases and often little action at all - and a long attention span. It repays with interest.",5,Ravishing,1309910400,"07 6, 2011",2011,776,"['think', 'Anne', 'Roussel', 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'screen', 'off', ""n't"", 'sing', 'actually', 'dubbing', 'lip-syncing', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'several', 'viewings', 'Yes', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'addition', 'Anne', 'scenery', 'also', 'beautiful', 'singing', 'sublime', 'eponymous', 'music', 'teacher', 'played', 'great', 'Belgian', 'baritone', 'Jose', 'Van', 'Dam', 'singing', 'Mahler', 'Ich', 'bin', 'der', 'welt', 'abhanden', 'gekommen', 'as', 'good', 'life', 'singing', 'competition', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'even', 'silly', 'small', 'price', 'pay', 'what', 'otherwise', 'musical', 'gem', 'require', 'quiet', 'place', 'are', 'car', 'chases', 'often', 'little', 'action', 'long', 'attention', 'span', 'interest']",Le Maître de Musique (The Music Teacher)
