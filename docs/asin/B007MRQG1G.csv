The good and bad of it all. I enjoy learning how and what are the best ways of doing this for ones self. But, this wasn't anything close to it. There was one man in particular in the movie that showed how he does things on a daily basis, but, didn't show from beginning to end on how he started it all.So, I do not encourage anyone in buying this movie. I, thank goodness, rented it for one time and glad I did just rent it because basically it was pretty boring.

It seemed more like a clip of this and a clip of that with a little back ground but you never really get too personal with the actual charter's.To me it seemed like the person filming  should have stayed more with one family and went through the whole year in more detail than he did.  I learned a little about sled dogs and saw some nice pictures but I really never felt attached to any one story line (which I felt miss led about in the title).  For a documentary I guess it's ok but as far as a modern day pioneer story I can only give it 3 stars , because it gave some facts of how some people made it in Alaska but not really enough depth to really hold my interest.
