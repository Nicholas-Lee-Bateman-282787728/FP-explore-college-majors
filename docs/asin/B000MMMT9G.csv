Plus Borat has a presence to him, and his mangled grammar strongly reflects what I've encountered in my 9 years in Asia.Like my title says, I don't think it's too vulgar.  I'm not easily offended.  Rather, I found its humor too predictable.  It set up these great situations and then got a little lazy in writing its way through them.  It's an independent film which, unlike Hollywood pablum, doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence.  But in the end I just didn't laugh much.This is much better than anything out of the Crocodile Dundee franchise, just to pick one example of ""foreigner in U S of the A"" comedies of the ""fish out of water"" variety.  But I quit after 30 or 40 minutes because it was just somehow missing something.  I can't quite say what.  Deep thought?  Follow-through?  A supporting cast that should've remained unemployees wannabes flipping burgers?  I have no cultural learnings to make benefit for you here.I really don't believe this is a two-star movie, by the way.  It is too glorious for that.

1047198,ANYRXHDVOVS17,B000MMMT9G,A. Customer,"[9, 31]","This movie is extremely funny, in a ""JACKASS"" sort of way, but comedy is dangerous and for two good reasons: (1)what we laugh at often reveals who we are; (2) comedy misplaced is offense, and woe unto him ""from whom offense cometh.""For example, is it funny, really funny, to learn that some Southern frat boys are racist?  Is it funny that we, with our experience of American history, have to LEARN that they are racist?  What might we have learned if Borat had pulled the same stunt at a Northern school?  I am certain we would have learned something there, too, really learned, for instance, that a certain kind of racism, if that is what you want to call it, shows up not just in the south--but alas the filmmaker has to make choices, so why not learn what we already know--let's go with the old stereotype about southerners and let it play out as ""surprising"" and ""revealing.""  But it is funny--I just don't know for sure why I'm laughing because, see, it's kind of a dumb, mean-sprited ""Candid Camera"" if viewed in a different light.  I'm sort of ashamed that I'm laughing, but I AM laughing.Second, Borat pretends to be a foreign national and the nation in question, Kazakhstan, is disturbed by his portrayal of them.  My first impulse is to say--get a life.  It's humor.  It's funny.  It's as innocent as . . . blackface.  Yeah.  Someone of a different (superior) ethnicity/nationality is merely dressing up as you (silly, quaint, backward idiots) and prancing around poking fun at your foibles and mannerisms to get a cheap laugh.  This is very funny stuff, and here is the proof: when the same kind of humor was done based on African Americans starting back in the late 1880s and 1890s and carried over into the twentieth century, everybody got a real kick out of it, even the silly, quaint, backward, African American idiots who were being spoofed to provide the cheap laugh.  Yeah, right.  How funny would ""BORAT"" be if it was about a white man in blackface, shucking and jiving-talking through Europe and Asia as a representative American journalist trying to find sexy white European girls to play on his big black meatpole?  That would be very funny, too, but I don't think such a film could be made today.  African Americans wouldn't stand for it (I wonder why?).  And if the star of that mythical film were actually a white-skinned Muslim Arab from, say, Iraq (yeah, an Iraqi in blackface, pretending to be a black American journalist in Europe looking for white European girls to sleep with), I don't think even white Americans (patriots that they be) would stand for that.  Do you see where I'm going with this?In all honesty, my point is that Borat is indeed very funny, but risky.  It is Candid Camera, Jackass, and Blackface all rolled up in one.  If you are in the right mood and you get the joke, then there is nothing funnier. Just don't be surprised if you're the only one laughing.  On the other hand, if you find yourself in a group where everyone is laughing, then be afraid.

If they did not have informed consent that contract may be null and void. A class action suit for defamation giving actual and punitive damages would put an end to these mock documentaries. Let them use real actors paid real wages to perform their script. Does this film have any redeeming social values?The impact of this film is how it measures popular taste. Barnum knew his public, and we may not be much different today.Does this film poke fun at stereotyped people? Does it have a political purpose in portraying ordinary people and taking advantage of them? Comedies of manners have always shown humor from the differences in expectations and reality (""Seinfeld"", ""Candid Camera""). ""Borat"" is like goading dumb animals to make them perform for a paying audience. Hours of filming ordinary people just to select the minutes where they can be made to look foolish and using a shill to guide the conversation and provoke comments is part of show business. You can see this on the ""Tonight"" show, or in some documentaries (like ""Sixty Minutes"").

I figured his character on Ali G is so great that the film would have nowhere to go but down - I was wrong.  The film is quite simply a work of genius.That said, this is not appropriate for children or people who are easily offended.  There is in particular one scene that, while absolutely hilarious, was by far the most disgusting thing I've ever seen in any film short of hard core porn (I'm quite surprised they even got that scene in with the R rating).I'd also highly recommend picking up both seasons of the Ali G show on DVD, both available on Amazon, if you like Borat - Cultural Learnings ...One final point, and I admit this is pure speculation, but in filming Borat they supposedly captured a LOT of footage that ended up on the cutting room floor.

I just feel it works best in ""Da Ali G Show."" For me, the best part in the film was with the Frat boys in the RV who watch the DVD with him and his heart breaks, this is just classic.  Another thing that worked great for me on the DVD was the compilation of the press footage Borat got. His appearances on Jay Leno and Conan are worth the price of the DVD alone and show just how far this man will go with people who may, or may not know how far that is, something that was not as central in the movie. To me, that's the appeal of every character in ""Da Ali G show"" and especially Borat since he plays off the the whole culture clash sensitivity and shows just how sensitive people are and how much some people try to hide it, just for the sake of a foreigner.

Yes, it was when I wholly realized just how `adlibbed' the majority of this film was that its genius really sunk in for me.  What Sacha Baron Cohen achieves here is not to be taken lightly.  This is a brilliantly composed slice of comedic pie; a hilarious riot that is all the more hysterical thanks to the way in which it was created.Like I stated in my review title; the man that duped America got the last laugh.In `Borat', Cohen portrays the fictitious character of Borat Sagdiyev, a man living in Kazakhstan who ventures to the United States (The U.S. and A) to learn experiences to further benefit his own country.  He takes along with him a fat guy and a cameraman to help document his journey.  He arrives in New York, visits News Stations, gets an etiquette coach, talks to feminist groups and then falls in love with Pamela Anderson while watching Baywatch and sets of on a nationwide adventure to find her in California.  On his journey he buys a bear to protect his from Jews, nearly insights a riot at a rodeo, finds himself partying with frat boys and gays, winds up being healed by some holly-rollers and tries to kidnap Pamela Anderson by throwing a sack over her head while attending her book signing.The fact that 90% of this isn't staged is just amazing.`Borat' is not a film for all.  In fact, many will find this highly offensive.  Even if you love this film you will most likely still find it highly offensive, which is part of its charm.  Cohen is a revelation here.  If is no surprise that he was inches from an Oscar nomination here (he's the only actor to win any award that year outside of Whitaker and Gosling) and he really should have gotten one; he's that inspired in his comedic approach.  He never once breaks character, which would have been hard for anyone to do while carrying around a plastic bag full of your own feces while attending a dinner party.

1047217,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B000MMMT9G,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[5, 10]","Borat is a marvel in the fields of mockumentaries and social experiments.  Sacha Baron Cohen's character of Borat, a Kazakh TV reporter, is not real, and yet he was able to fool a whole lot of people into thinking he was.  The film follows Borat (Cohen) and his producer Azamat (Ken Davitian) as they travel across the United States to film a documentary with the mission of observing American culture and using it to improve Kazakhstan.  The twist is that while Borat and Azamat are fictional characters, most everyone in the film are real people.The film starts and ends in Borat's home village in Kazakhstan, which is portrayed as a stereotypical ex-communist bloc country; it is very poor, cultural aspects that were cool in America 20 years ago are cool now, and there is a lot of intolerance (the town is extremely anti-Semitic).  All of the people in these scenes are actors, but once Borat gets to America, nearly (I would say 98%) all of the people interviewed for the documentary are real people who have no idea that Borat isn't real.While the stated purpose of Borat is to make Kazakhstan a better country, Cohen's mission statement was to show the sheer absurdity of American political correctness.  Though we live in a PC culture, racist, sexist, and other ""-ist"" ideas boil beneath the surface.  Borat is a character who says incredibly offensive things without realizing it.  His poor grasp on the English language and racist and sexist upbringing get him into trouble with a lot of people, such as when he tells a group of feminists that it is a proven fact that women have smaller brains than men.  The interesting thing is that most people don't object to any of the insensitive things that Borat says, while a few even agree with him and back up his claims.  For example, while attending a rodeo in the south, he tells the foreman that in his country, homosexuals are hanged.  The foreman responds by saying that people in America wish that they could do that here.The movie is incredibly offensive, but nothing that Borat says will offend you.  It is what we Americans do in response.  Borat is a fictional character, and while the things he says are silly, we know that Cohen doesn't mean them.

It's extremely politically incorrect, kinda juvenile in spots and just one huge laugh, that is, if the insulting of Jews, women and ""retards,"" or seeing a nude 400 lb. guy in all his flabbiness won't put you off your popcorn.The full title (Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan) gives a sense of how our hero, as portrayed by Londoner Sacha Cohen, fractures the English language. Kazakhstani TV reporter Borat was originally one of three Cohen characters on the half-hour BBC-TV comedy series,DA ALI G SHOW(2003). This movie expands on his anti-Semitism, misogny and penchant for misspoken scatology as Borat films a documentary of his travels across America from east to west.Borat is based on an incredibly funny doctor that Cohen met while in southern Russia. Those of us who appreciate a good belly laugh are truly grateful for this chance encounter.Erran Cohen's fanciful national anthem ""O Kazakhstan"" has a tune and lyrics that immediately invade your brain. Here are two of its less-objectional verses:Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan you very nice placeFrom Plains of Darashik to Northern fence of JewtownKazakhstan friend of all except UzbekistanA very nosy people with bone in their brainKazakhstan industry best in worldWe invented toffee and trouser pantsKazakhstan's prostitutes cleanest in the regionExcept of course for too many scarsExtras on the DVD include outtakes (some good, some really boring) and a collage film of Sacha in character enjoying a new-found American fame that was at near-mania levels back in 2006.",5,"Borat: ""Thank you for watch my film.

Yeah right.  The movie's about a man who travels across America and meets different people and religions and does nothing but disrespects them the entire time.  It's all because he wants to go to California and have a relationship with Pamela Anderson.The best way to respect the REAL people who actually had their feelings hurt during the recording of this film is to give it a low rating.  Sure, I laughed at a few parts, such as the bear in the ice cream truck scaring away children and the two naked men wrestling each other in the bedroom (in a very disgusting, almost sexual, way).  Still, everything about the movie was more about shocking the audience instead of delivering a satisfying story.  When the movie was finally released, many people found out they were involved in the film who didn't have a clue about it while the film was being made, and these people felt absolutely sick about the movie, and rightfully so.One man going across America making fun of all the cultures and religions isn't funny to me.  People have a right to hate this movie with a passion.

His work here completely solidifies his reputation, and I look forward to him finding more work in Hollywood. Perhaps, like with Jim Carrey, they'll build entire films around his presence which would suit this fan just fine. It sounds like they're on the road to doing so as I read he's making a movie with Johnny Depp and I know he played a character in Talladega Nights. As for Borat, it is a magnificent film and I highly recommend it; although, it certainly isn't something that you can see over and over again. Its humor is all of the ""embarrassment"" variety so it goes down with the jolt and thrill of a shot of Maker's Mark. You do feel very bad for the average citizen who finds his or her self unintentionally lampooned. One aspect of it I loved in particular was the interaction between Borat and his producer. With the suit and short tie he was a 100 percent sterling imitation of a Soviet Union bureaucrat. Every time I saw that guy I laughed.  I must disagree over the anti-Semitism charges as Borat's posing as an anti-Semite created the situation in which people could then speak more freely. Borat is also fun to laugh at and laughing at him also allows for the satirization of those who hold the same offensive views. We know that Jews don't run our nation or are a force of evil so it's quite natural, and healthy, to laugh at those fools who think otherwise. There's no Jew baiting here in my opinion.

If the latter, the success of the film across the Atlantic demonstrates a quite unforseen and admirable capacity of the Americans to laugh at themselves.

I love how Sasha Cohen is able to comically highlight certain reactionary political/social attitudes that are prevalent in our society.  The best material is when he is making this social critique.  The parts that I found unfunny are when he is abusive to those of good will ... the scene at the etiquette dinner party comes to mind.  He insults one of the women at the dinner table by saying that the two women on either side of him would both be considered attractive in his nation, but not her.  Why be mean about something so personal as a woman's appearance? It seemed just like cruelty for cruelty's sake.The bag of ""poop"" that he brings to the dinner table in the same vignette is likewise not funny and in doing so, he is basically expressing contempt for all social protocols. That is boringly base, something from a Tom Green show, not really creative.I think that Cohen should have decided what type of film he wanted to make and been consistent with his larger vision of a good-willed but incisive social critique. Michael Moore has shown that you can be very funny but still have heart.That being said, parts of the this film are uniquely brilliant.  I enjoyed the intro segment from Borat's ""hometown."" It was filmed in rural Romania and the authentic setting as a backdrop to the film's absurdist humor made it absolutely sidesplittingly funny.  Also very illuminating was the rodeo audience response to his comments regarding the Iraq war; the cheering from the crowd showed a bloodthirstiness that thoughtful people should abhor. The naked fight scene between him and his producer served as a humorous foil to people's homophobia.Cohen has talent in spades, no doubt.

All Amazon customers should find this censorship disturbing. Free speech means unpopular speech. Amazon must feel their products are very week if they cannot withstand criticism.A Borat Fan Who Didn't Like `Borat'As a long time fan of Sacha Baron Cohen's Borat character I looked forward to the `Borat' movie. But sadly I left the theatre only mildly amused. Unfortunately `Borat' suffered from the two major flaws Cohen's `Ali G' movie suffered from: 1. We've seen these exact same jokes before for the past 5 years. 2. The film is not ""real"", humiliating actors is simply not funny.`Borat: Cultural Learnings' brings Borat to America with an obese side kick whom travel the country visiting rednecks and the elderly at beds and breakfasts and antique stores. They see how rude and crude they can get before people finally have enough of them. For example Borat attends a formal Southern dinner where he calls a guest a ""retard"" and brings along a prostitute and pretends to defecate in a plastic bag. Borat's other source of humor is getting people to admit their prejudices. Borat goes to a gun shop and asks for a gun to ""kill Jews"". The gun salesman shows him an Israeli Desert Eagle.Why this isn't funny! We've seen this before again and again and again and again on Ali G in the UK and to a lesser extent on HBO with about 20% new material. Over time it looses its affect. I love `Married with Children' but a `Married' motion picture which simply featured Al Bundy selling shoes would not be funny. We would want Al Bundy doing something new. The same standard applies to Borat. Do something NEW! An example is the opening scene where Borat tours his home town and introduces its eccentric characters. Borat has already done this on his UK show where he visited an Eastern European shanty town (supposedly Kazakhstan) and introduced locals whom didn't understand English as his wives, mistresses, and incestuous sister.I'm now going to burst the bubble here on Amazon, `Borat: Cultural Learnings' is not real! It was scripted with actors. In other news the Pope is Catholic. Oh I know `Borat' fans here on Amazon have been citing such impeccable sources as Wikipedia and the `Weekly World News' but yes `Borat' does feature actors not real people. The evidence is obvious. 1. I'VE SEEN SOME OF THESE ACTORS BEFORE 2. None of these offended participants goes after the camera and boom mike as they would in real life. 3. There would not be adequate cameras, lighting, and boom mikes to create all of this footage. 3. Only three celebrities appear in the film. Pamela Andresen, whom Borat tries to abduct is obviously staged. And former congressmen Alan Keyes and Bob Barr. Their time can be purchased by anyone from their lecture circuit even for entrainment purposes, plus both ultra conservatives Keyes and Barr are well known for doing comedic appearances. 4. Borat handles a Desert Eagle but leaves the gun shop with out it because he is not an American citizen. Of course Borat would not have been able to even hold the unloaded gun without proof of citizenship. The gun salesman would have lost his license and gone to jail.This is the thing about `Borat' which bothered me so much IT'S NOT REAL like Borat usually is. Having current Congressman Newt Gingrich appear on Ali G thinking he was truly talking politics, now that was funny.My general arguments against `Borat's authenticity are usually dismissed by fans claiming that some of the ""real people"" in the film were upset with their portrayal and are suing the producers. What they don't see is that mocumentaries often use fake news stories to enhance the publicity of their film. You may recall that Warner Herzog's mocumentary `Incident at Loch Ness' also claimed to have been the victim of lawsuits resulting from the two ""real people"" killed in the film.

1047256,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B000MMMT9G,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[2, 2]","A couple of years ago, in 2006, the biggest comedy hit was a film called Borat: Cultural Learnings Of America For Make Benefit Glorious Nation Of Kazakhstan. The film grew out of a recurring character on a British television show, Da Ali G. Show, created by Jewish comedian Sacha Baron Cohen. I mention the man's religion because the film attacks Anti-Semitism in a brutally funny way, even as many dull-witted critics accuse the film of that bias. If so, then Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator was also Anti-Semitic, and his Monsieur Verdoux was a defense of mass murder. Cohen plays a Kazakh television reporter, Borat Sagdiyev, sent to America to make a documentary on American living for the benefit of his home nation. That's the setup, which starts in Borat's native village, and depicts his family and villagers as a bunch of creepy, incestuous morons who have an annual `Running Of The Jew' festival, ala the bulls at Pamplona, Spain. Of course, this is not because the film is satirizing that `reality,' but because it's picking up and throwing the Western preconceptions of that country back in the faces of that audience, much the same way that the film Everything Is Illuminated portrayed the Russian natives that are presented as idiots in that film in ways to tweak the preconceptions those people and customs engender in the West. In keeping with that, the supposed Kazakh language and `National Anthem' are, naturally, gibberish and folly.The 84 minute film is a mockumentary that is not subtle in anything it does (ala Spinal Tap, or the Christopher Guest films), and is certainly not a work of genius, anymore than a Three Stooges short is, so why so many viewers and critics felt so negatively about the film, even as it broke box office records, shows that American stupidity is never to be underestimated, even though a similar ruckus ensued a few years earlier when the satiric tv cartoon South Park was made into a terrifically scalding movie. After the setup, the film is a series of blackout sketches that take Borat (in character) as he basically does a Candid Camera routine in front of gullible Americans who believe he is a legitimate Russian reporter. He has run ins with politicos like Alan Keyes and Bob Barr- the current Libertarian Party Presidential candidate, a gay pride parade, and a group of Feminazis. Cohen deliciously gets all to reveal their own darker and denser sides. All of the sketches are gotten through quickly, so the jokes never get old. The one thread in the film is that Borat's ugly wife dies, not long after Borat sees a Baywatch rerun, and falls in love with Pamela Anderson, whom he decides to sexually pursue crosscountry. Along with him, in a used ice cream truck they buy, is an unseen Kazakh cameraman and the film's producer, Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitian). Other than Cohen and Davitian, the only other real actors in the film are Anderson, who makes a late cameo when Borat literally tries to bag her, and a black woman named Luenell, who plays a prostitute Borat ends up marrying.Through it all, a number of misadventures occur, such as a test of etiquette lessons at a dinner party with Southern white racists, learning cultural tips from black gangstas in a Southern hood, rodeo goers who display an immense amount of cowboy xenophobia, slavery loving frat boys who pick Borat up in the desert and show him a Pamela Anderson porno tape to dispirit him, and Pentecostalists who speak in tongues, who teach him the power of Mr. Jesus. But, bar none, the funniest scene in the film comes when Borat leaves a hotel bathroom, and finds Azamat jerking off to his magazine. The two engage in a naked fight that ends up with Azamat pouncing on Borat in a 69 position, and the two of them running naked through the hotel, until tackled and asked to leave. This is what separates the two men, and sends Borat into the desert. Ultimately, he loses Pamela Anderson- whom he never had, and marries Luenell, and reports that life back in Kazakhstan is better than before.The Twentieth Century Fox DVD has an old Soviet Era film feel to it, replete with badly worn looking film stock and Cyrillic lettering, and poor English translations of the gibberish Kazakh language. It has no audio commentary, but has some cool deleted scenes- although it was a good decision to excise them, especially a long and tedious (although funny) supermarket scene. There are also faux commercials- a music infomercial for the movie's soundtrack, a Kazakh Baywatch spoof called Sexydrownwatch, and an interesting compendium of the worldwide publicity tour for the film, including some late night tv appearances with Cohen in character as Borat.One of the more interesting sidelights of researching this film was seeing how many people who appeared, and signed waivers, tried to sue the filmmakers (including director Larry Charles). This includes the nation of Kazakhstan and a group representing Gypsies, who claim their town was defamed and presented in a bad light, for Cohen shot that portion of the film in Romania. Yet, I was not astonished. Anytime someone shows up another party, be it intellectually or humorously (or, worst of all, both ways) there are bound to be immature and money-grubbing morons looking to make an unethical buck. That none of the rubes could figure out they were being put on bespeaks the utter idiocy of the American public at large. Now, it's hard to believe all the scenes were taken cold. After all, could the frat boys have had the Pamela Anderson video needed to despoil Borat's dream? Yes, she's a frat boy fantasy, but still, Occam's Razor says it was a setup, and indeed, all the alleged lawsuits may be just a part of the publicity campaign.Nonetheless, the film suffers none the worse for it. And, if all the scenes were truly done cold, it bespeaks much of the goodness of the poorer and more disenfranchised members of society than the well off. Blue collar folk, the black gangstas, and the gay paraders, all embrace Borat with humor and grace, whereas the rich and white often scorn him. And, despite the harsh attacks on the film, culturally and socially, and despite there being nothing too deep here, Borat is a wonderful critique- nay, full out assault, on the asininity of Political Correctness, for, despite all the claimed offenses in the film, none of the people who appeared and filed lawsuits suffered anything they did not inflict themselves, due to their own arrogance and biases, and fully knowing they had signed proper legal releases, which is included at the film's credit's end.Borat is the sort of a film that comes along at a certain moment and finds its niche (the hysteria and xenophobia rampant post-9/11), due to events in the real world, but will not long be remembered once the situations that made it so popular fade. Nonetheless, even in 50 years, there will still be a dozen or so scenes that will give one laughing pains the way a Moe, Larry, and Curly eye gouge still does.

The B&B; part was a total setup, maybe even done in a set with actors, but most of the rest of this movie I do think rang impressively true.

Borat Sagdiyev is a journalist/TV personality in Kazakhstan, which is stereotyped as a backward, vulgar society of cretins. Borat travels to the US to make a documentary. He sees a video clip of Baywatch star and Playboy playmate Pamela Anderson and decides he is going to marry her, so he sets off on a cross-country trip with his traveling companion from Kazakhstan, Azamat Bagatov.Along the way they meet a variety of American stereotypes including a Pentecostal preacher and his congregation, black street teenagers, fraternity boys, a southern country club couple, rude New Yorkers, etc. etc. Most are shocked or put off by Borat&#8217;s verbal malapropisms and inappropriate behavior, and their reactions expose their racism and bigotry. Or so the hype goes. This is supposedly a satire. It might have been more effective as satire if Borat himself was not so obnoxious.The humor, if it can be called that, is of the grossest and most predictable kind. The bull-in-a-china-shop scene where Borat stumbles around in an antique store breaking hundreds of dollars worth of merchandise, has been around since Laurel & Hardy. He is crushed when the frat boys show him a sex tape of Pamela Anderson. At a posh dinner party he asks his hostess to use the toilet and when he returns he hands her a plastic bag of feces.Bad taste might be excusable if it were truly funny or serves a  purpose, and I suppose I will be labeled stuffy and uptight for not finding these funny. Sacha Baron Cohen has created a character that millions of people obviously found hilarious judging from reviews and the popularity of the film.

He lands in New York, falls in love with Pamela Anderson when he sees her on television, and so he and his producer Azamat make a road trip to meet her in California. This is the only plot of the film, and it is irrelevant to its purpose. Borat has benefited from the truth that there is no such thing as bad publicity. The controversial film will offend just about everyone with its anti-Semitic, racist, misogynist, homophobic, and anti-Christian humor. To me the problem with the film was not its vulgarity, which was plenty bad, but that the film simply wasn't funny, and that's a problem for a comedy. Some of Borat was staged, and other parts were real life ambushes of unsuspecting people; the directors will not say which parts are which. Those who defend Borat argue that it's a clever satire about bigotry; others argue that it aggravates it.

If you like the film, you are hip, cool, and part of the new in-crowd immune to the silly dictates of common decency and Political Correctness.If you don't like ""Borat,"" you are an old fuddy-duddy or spinster schoolmarm.I laugh at dead baby jokes. I was a nurse's aid and then a Peace Corps volunteer, and I learned to laugh at death, bodily fluids, pus-filled sores, and intestinal parasites.I cannot tell you how much I hated ""Borat."" I would have walked out, but I had to keep watching because of my field of study.Based on reviews, I expected a penetrating, edgy critique of Political Correctness that would make me laugh out loud. I did not laugh once. (Full disclosure: others in the theater did.) I'd like to offer you samples of what passes for humor in ""Borat,"" but if I did so, this site would not run my review. That's because just about every joke - - not just some of them but just about every one - - is made at the intrusively graphic expense of women or homosexuals, and/or it involves bodily excretions.An example. Baron Cohen is a guest at the home of a genuinely charming woman. After defecating, he hands her his fecal matter. That's a big joke. If you are laughing now, this movie is for you.In another scene, Baron Cohen, without any clothing on at all, wrestles with another undressed man who is grotesquely obese. During this wrestling match, they assume poses for activities I can't name; if I did, this site would not run this review. If jokes at the expense of fat homosexual men are your cup of tea, this movie is for you.I've never seen such a hateful movie in a mainstream theater. Again, I know full well that I sound like a schoolmarm when I say that. Sacha Baron Cohen, I would have to guess, based on this movie, hates the human race, including you, the ticket buyer. He is willing to exploit everyone he encounters, to humiliate them on camera, to get you, the ticket buyer, someone he also hates, to laugh at others' suffering. Once you do that, he can laugh at you. If watching decent people doing their best to deal with an obnoxious creep is your cup of tea, then this movie is for you.I feel like repeating over and over: I laughed at Todd Solondz's ""Happiness."" I laugh at politically incorrect humor. And I hated this movie.There's more going on here, and I know I'm risking a lot by pointing this out.Borat speaks Polish. Only speakers of Polish will get that. He says ""Dzien Dobry,"" ""jak sie masz,"" ""dziekuje"" and other Polish phrases. The film's opening and closing scenes were shot in a real Eastern European village. Real Eastern European folk music is played on the soundtrack.With ""Ali G,"" Baron Cohen exploited vicious stereotypes of Blacks. With ""Borat"" Baron Cohen is not targeting Kazaks. He's exploiting a centuries-old, contemptuous and hateful stereotype of Eastern European peasants that can be found in various Western cultures - witness the American ""Polak joke"" - - and is common in one thread of Jewish culture. In this stereotype, Poles, and, by extension, Eastern European Christian peasants, are, like Borat, ignorant, bestial, and disgusting. A good pr&eacute;cis of the stereotype can be found in a famous passage in Isaac Bashevis Singer's ""The Slave."" It can be found in the ""Golem"" article on my website.In fact, ""Borat"" has a lot in common with Marian Marzynski's controversial film ""Shtetl."" In both, cameras invade an impoverished Eastern European peasant village. Villagers who are not sophisticated or worldly are conned into appearing on camera to perform for us as if they were trained monkeys. We laugh at them, or feel disgust at them, because they are dirty, because they are poor, and because they keep pigs. In any case, gazing at these lesser peasants, we know that we are superior. Perhaps Baron Cohen will try this technique next in a Darfur refugee camp or a homeless shelter. Poor, unsophisticated people can be so amusing.Baron Cohen speaks of women as if they were less than dirt. Don't misunderstand him. He's not mocking misogyny. He's milking misogyny. The things Baron Cohen says about women in this movie are grotesque; they are brutal. He makes fun of mentally retarded people. He makes fun of white, Christian Southerners, a group everyone feels safe mocking.Reviews, and no doubt many viewers, are telling you that ""Borat"" is a fearless laugh riot that punctures political correctness and makes you laugh till you cry. It's that very description that made me want to see it. I thought I'd be getting something like the Colbert Report.I've gotta think I'm not the only one, though, who found looking at Baron Cohen's hatred for an hour and a half to be an icky, profoundly

Before WWII, American humor consisted of silliness. After the war, humor began to take itself seriously, particularly in the 60s with all these so-called brilliant comedians with college educations and axes to grind. Pure nonsense got lost along the way. Many of us have not forgotten, however, as evidenced by the continuing popularity of the Marx Brothers. Borat fits right in with that lovable family of goofs. Can't you just picture him there at the races with Harpo, Groucho, or Zeppo? The intelligence, of which he has plenty, is shown in his razor sharp satire. Oh, this goofiness should not be interpreted as stupidity. He's brilliant. He's a genius. He's sees a lot, and in this short film succeeds in showing as much about America that is true and deeply revealing as any of the serious dramas that incite rave reviews. Borat falls in with Harpo Marx and Forrest Gump as a lovable moron whose innocence is crucial for exposing the lies and hypocrisy of Americans, especially those who claim to be ""good,"" ""honest,"" or ""proper.""

I've never seen Sasha Baron Cohen's ""Ali-G"" Show on HBO, but his ""Borat"" character from the show did just fine in his own feature-length movie.  Much of the tale of Borat's (a Kazakh journalist's cultural adventures in the US) was unscripted, as Americans he encountered were led to believe that Borat was a legitimate journalist. Their reactions are understandable in some cases (as when Borat tries to kiss male strangers in the ""traditional"" Kazakh way in the subway), and just plain scary in others (as when the gun dealer recommends ""a gun to kill Jews with"").  The result is almost non-stop hilarity, from the Running of the Jews in Borat's hometown in Kazakhstan, to his rendition of the Kazakh national anthem (""oh glorious exporter of potassium"") at a Virginia rodeo.  The movie features a lot of bathroom humor (much of it very graphic), sex humor (all talk) and hairy male body humor (much of it just gross), but you never know what's coming next--somehow it's all both direct and subtle enough to keep you both grossed out and guessing.

Surprise!  It makes some good points and there are some laughs.  Mostly though I think the average viewer would be grossed out about half the time.  But that's okay.  For the average movie-goer or DVD watcher, getting grossed out is a lot better than being bored.Of course you might be bored too.  Personally I don't think I could watch the naked mock fight between Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) and Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitan) again.  I wasn't so much grossed out as made to feel that really I ought to find better ways to waste my time.Yes, we're bored in America.  Our neurons are sated with violence, pornography, and crude, boorish behavior toward our fellows (both real and on TV and in the movies).  Which is why, to be successful, people like Sacha Baron Cohen have to turn up the crude volume to get the old laugh-o-meter activated.  A glimpse of stocking used to be looked on as something shocking, now, heaven knows, anything goes.But should we care?  Yes, your preteen sons are going to find out who in the neighborhood has this DVD and they're going to watch it.  Will they be scarred for life?  Will they ""get it""?  Will it make them uncouth?  Will they watch it more than half a dozen times?One of the interesting things about this movie is the publicity it got and the controversy it engendered.  Kazakhstan initially was greatly offended and protested loudly at this misrepresentation of its people.  But then they thought it over and realized that maybe this isn't necessarily such a bad thing.  In Hollywood any publicity is good.  They probably figured out that what is being made fun of is the average American's provincial attitude toward foreigners.  Cohen goes a long way toward proving that with the scene at the rodeo, for example, where his line, ""We support your war of terror!"" gets a nice round of applause.  And the guy who thinks that somebody with a moustache looks like a Muslim who looks like a terrorist adds a little to the impression that Americans, when they think about foreigners, think superficially.Actually, they don't do any real thinking.  Xenophobia reigns supreme in the heartland--but that would be the heartland of any country.  The frequent anti-Semitic shtick throughout was originally aimed at Europeans, I understand, who despite the embarrassment of the Holocaust are apparently as anti-Semitic as ever.  But Cohen, who is Jewish, makes fun of the antisemitism of Muslims as well as Westerners.  And he makes fun of the uneducated and uncouth as well as the superficially sophisticated--witness the scene at the Magnolia Fine Dining Society.Some people sued or threatened to sue.  Some guys from the University of South Carolina who were caught off guard and drunk, mouthed some stupidities for all of the world to hear.  They sued but lost the case, I understand.Larry Charles of TV's Seinfeld fame directed.  He achieved some tension with the simple plot of Borat coming to American and making a road trip across the land to California to meet and hopefully mate with Pamela Anderson.  That was pretty funny.  I understand that some of the scenes were staged and scripted, for example the book signing scene with Miss Anderson was at least partly staged.  But other scenes were play-as-you-go with Cohen just making up stuff and saying provocative things to get reactions from the innocents.  The scene in the bathroom with the woman from the Magnolia Fine Dining Society was pretty funny as she explains to Borat so seriously and so sincerely how to wipe himself.Bottom line here is, should you bother to watch?  My answer: maybe if you can stand the crudities, and maybe if you don't squirm at satire directed at Americans.  On the other hand, this is not in my opinion in the same league as some other famous comedic movies.  Certainly it is not nearly as good as Blazing Saddles (1974), which I was watching the other night.  Finally, the techniques used by Cohen and Charles are interesting in their own right because of the reaction of people who were taken in, or somewhat taken in, and so that they ended up saying some outrageous and embarrassing things.",3,Crude and gross but with some telling satire,1176681600,"04 16, 2007",2007,4305,"['superficially', 'mockumentary', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'satire', 'people', 'Kazakhstan', 'citizens', 'country', 'thereabouts', 'really', 'satire', 'America', 'beautiful', 'Surprise', 'good', 'points', 'are', 'laughs', 'Mostly', 'think', 'average', 'viewer', 'would', 'be', 'grossed', 'out', 'time', 'okay', 'average', 'movie-goer', 'DVD', 'watcher', 'getting', 'grossed', 'out', 'lot', 'better', 'being', 'bored.Of', 'course', 'might', 'be', 'bored', 'too', 'Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'watch', 'naked', 'mock', 'fight', 'Borat', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'Azamat', 'Bagatov', 'Ken', 'Davitan', 'again', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'grossed', 'out', 'made', 'feel', 'really', 'ought', 'find', 'better', 'ways', 'waste', 'time.Yes', ""'re"", 'bored', 'America', 'neurons', 'are', 'sated', 'violence', 'pornography', 'crude', 'boorish', 'behavior', 'fellows', 'real', 'TV', 'movies', 'Which', 'why', 'be', 'successful', 'people', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'have', 'turn', 'up', 'crude', 'volume', 'get', 'old', 'laugh-o-meter', 'activated', 'glimpse', 'stocking', 'used', 'be', 'looked', 'something', 'shocking', 'now', 'heaven', 'anything', 'goes.But', 'should', 'care', 'Yes', 'preteen', 'sons', 'are', 'going', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'neighborhood', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'going', 'watch', 'Will', 'be', 'scarred', 'life', 'Will', 'get', 'Will', 'make', 'uncouth', 'Will', 'watch', 'more', 'dozen', 'times', 'One', 'interesting', 'things', 'movie', 'publicity', 'got', 'controversy', 'engendered', 'Kazakhstan', 'initially', 'was', 'greatly', 'offended', 'protested', 'loudly', 'misrepresentation', 'people', 'then', 'thought', 'realized', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'such', 'bad', 'thing', 'Hollywood', 'publicity', 'good', 'probably', 'figured', 'out', 'what', 'being', 'made', 'fun', 'average', 'American', 'provincial', 'attitude', 'foreigners', 'Cohen', 'long', 'way', 'proving', 'scene', 'rodeo', 'example', 'where', 'line', 'support', 'war', 'terror', 'nice', 'round', 'applause', 'guy', 'who', 'somebody', 'moustache', 'Muslim', 'who', 'terrorist', 'little', 'impression', 'Americans', 'when', 'think', 'foreigners', 'think', 'superficially.Actually', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'real', 'thinking', 'Xenophobia', 'reigns', 'supreme', 'heartland', 'would', 'be', 'heartland', 'country', 'frequent', 'anti-Semitic', 'shtick', 'was', 'originally', 'aimed', 'Europeans', 'understand', 'who', 'embarrassment', 'Holocaust', 'are', 'apparently', 'as', 'anti-Semitic', 'ever', 'Cohen', 'who', 'Jewish', 'fun', 'antisemitism', 'Muslims', 'as', 'well', 'Westerners', 'fun', 'uneducated', 'uncouth', 'as', 'well', 'superficially', 'sophisticated', 'scene', 'Magnolia', 'Fine', 'Dining', 'Society.Some', 'people', 'sued', 'threatened', 'sue', 'guys', 'University', 'South', 'Carolina', 'who', 'were', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'drunk', 'mouthed', 'stupidities', 'world', 'hear', 'sued', 'lost', 'case', 'understand.Larry', 'Charles', 'TV', 'Seinfeld', 'fame', 'directed', 'achieved', 'tension', 'simple', 'plot', 'Borat', 'coming', 'American', 'making', 'road', 'trip', 'land', 'California', 'meet', 'hopefully', 'mate', 'Pamela', 'Anderson', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'understand', 'scenes', 'were', 'staged', 'scripted', 'example', 'book', 'signing', 'scene', 'Miss', 'Anderson', 'was', 'least', 'partly', 'staged', 'other', 'scenes', 'were', 'play-as-you-go', 'Cohen', 'just', 'making', 'up', 'stuff', 'saying', 'provocative', 'things', 'get', 'reactions', 'innocents', 'scene', 'bathroom', 'woman', 'Magnolia', 'Fine', 'Dining', 'Society', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Borat', 'so', 'seriously', 'so', 'sincerely', 'how', 'wipe', 'himself.Bottom', 'line', 'here', 'should', 'bother', 'watch', 'answer', 'maybe', 'can', 'stand', 'crudities', 'maybe', 'do', ""n't"", 'squirm', 'satire', 'directed', 'Americans', 'other', 'hand', 'not', 'opinion', 'same', 'league', 'other', 'famous', 'comedic', 'movies', 'Certainly', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'Blazing', 'Saddles', '1974', 'was', 'watching', 'other', 'night', 'Finally', 'techniques', 'used', 'Cohen', 'Charles', 'are', 'interesting', 'own', 'right', 'reaction', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'taken', 'somewhat', 'taken', 'so', 'ended', 'up', 'saying', 'outrageous', 'embarrassing', 'things']",N/A

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[4, 5]","As they say, there's a sucker born every minute, but taking BORAT into account, multiply that equation by at least ten.  Comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, playing a reporter from Kazakhstan ostensibly in the States to make a documentary, pulls one sadistic prank after another, from sea to shining sea, on unsuspecting folks who subsequently become his comedic accomplices.  The result is funny; hilariously funny; side-splittingly funny.From BORAT's opening sequence from his (fictitious) village in Kazakhstan, this film serves notice that everyone, regardless of politically correct protection, is fair game.  And Cohen also sends the metaphorical shot across the bow that his brand of humor is not for the faint of heart, then promptly backs it up by such ostentatious behavior as bringing his own feces to a formal dinner gathering--to fighting and wrestling with his alleged manager (an obese and very hairy Ken Davitian) along the halls, lobby, and convention room of a packed hotel. . .both men as naked as the day they came into the world.  It's outrageous, it's often disgusting, it's raw and shocking--yet it's also hysterical, as Cohen's shocked bystanders swallow it all, hook, line, and sinker.That's right.  From chasing terrified New Yorkers in central Manhattan to wreaking havoc in a Texas antiques store, BORAT captures people in the act of being themselves.  Most of the time it's not pretty, but it's darn sure funny, and it's 100 percent revealing.

This is completely stupid, completely funny comedy. I'll skip the details of the story, since so many other reviewers have clued you in on the premise, and instead tell you that if you appreciate funny, aren't easily offended, and like something different, get this movie.My face only used about three expressions while I watched Borat. First was disbelief and shock in what I was seeing followed by complete surprise and laughter, with moments of digust thrown in for good measure. I mumbled things like, ""Oh no..."" or ""I can't believe it,"" and ""He just..."" throughout the film.This movie is fresh, though Borats antics are not, considering he was doing this stuff on ""Da Ali G Show"" for a while. It required a movie like this to present this character to those of us who don't watch TV that often.One reviewer mentioned that while the character of Borat is funny, ""what is funnier is watching the reaction to the character by the people that he is duping,"" And that couldn't be more true. The candid aspect is what makes this movie really work.Most of the people in this film were not actors, and had signed a release to consent being filmed for a ""documentary.""

1047290,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000MMMT9G,Ed Uyeshima,"[16, 23]","This is definitely a comedy that lives completely on the edge. Its sheer audacity and fearlessness against public rebuke are admirable to some, repulsive to others. Except for a few groaners, this is one of the most hilariously observant films about global perceptions of the U.S. and an incisive, unguarded account of the prevailing social attitudes and cultural taboos in this country. In a compelling Andy Kaufman-like turn, Sacha Baron Cohen plays Borat Sagdiyev, a television commentator from Kazakhstan, here portrayed as the most backward of third-world countries. He has been assigned by his government to travel to the U.S. to make a documentary about American cultural mores.After introducing us to his country, Borat arrives in Manhattan accompanied by his hefty, worrisome producer Azamat. But there is a change of plan when Borat sets his sights on Pamela Anderson and sets out on a road trip across the country to meet her in L.A. There is no let-up of ridiculous sight gags and maddeningly funny asides during its quickly paced 82-minute running time. Unlike the Pamploma bulls, there is the ""Running of the Jew"" in which the Kazakh villagers attack a couple of giant, papier-mch&eacute; puppets, Mr. and Mrs. Jew, who in turn lays a giant egg which the local children beat furiously with sticks. Other scenes have Borat erroneously presuming that a hotel elevator is his room and being a semi-attentive student to amazingly tolerant instructors as he gets lessons on comedy, driving and etiquette.Throughout the movie, Cohen keeps upping the ante and yielding even more comic dividends  - a question to a gun store clerk about the best weapon to kill Jews answered without hesitation; a B&B; owned by a kindly Jewish couple which turns into a scene from ""The Blair Witch Project""; a conservative Southern dinner party that gets ugly when Borat invites an overweight black prostitute as his guest; an aging cowboy who lets his bigotry spew freely at the rodeo; a trio of frat boys from South Carolina who enthusiastically share their supremely sexist attitudes; and most infamously, an extended naked wrestling match between Borat and the grotesque Azamat that ends up in a convention of mortgage brokers. All these scenes expose a raw nerve which feels concurrently offensive, truthful and hilariously comic.Credit needs to go to director Larry Charles, who guides this venture with the same type of deadpan &eacute;lan he showed with HBO's ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" and the screenplay by Cohen, Anthony Hines, Peter Baynham, and Dan Mazer, which lends a loose structure to what seems to be a series of staged scenes with all the non-actors. But above anything else, it's Cohen's major accomplishment that he can make Borat an anti-Semitic, sexist homophobe and still have him come across as an amiable, cheek-kissing fellow full of innocently executed malapropisms. I'm sure the easily offended will continue to express their disgust, but for the more adventurous, brace yourself for a comedy that will make you roar with laughter while giving you that unsettling feeling of recognition. It's quite a trick which Cohen and company pull off superbly.",5,Relentless Skewering of American Cultural Mores Yields a Hilariously Astute Comedy,1164758400,"11 29, 2006",2006,3163,"['definitely', 'comedy', 'completely', 'edge', 'sheer', 'audacity', 'fearlessness', 'public', 'rebuke', 'are', 'admirable', 'repulsive', 'others', 'few', 'groaners', 'one', 'most', 'hilariously', 'observant', 'films', 'global', 'perceptions', 'U.S.', 'incisive', 'unguarded', 'account', 'prevailing', 'social', 'attitudes', 'cultural', 'taboos', 'country', 'compelling', 'Andy', 'Kaufman-like', 'turn', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'Borat', 'Sagdiyev', 'television', 'commentator', 'Kazakhstan', 'here', 'portrayed', 'most', 'backward', 'third-world', 'countries', 'been', 'assigned', 'government', 'travel', 'U.S.', 'make', 'documentary', 'American', 'cultural', 'mores.After', 'introducing', 'country', 'Borat', 'Manhattan', 'accompanied', 'hefty', 'worrisome', 'producer', 'Azamat', 'change', 'plan', 'when', 'Borat', 'sights', 'Pamela', 'Anderson', 'out', 'road', 'trip', 'country', 'meet', 'L.A', 'let-up', 'ridiculous', 'sight', 'gags', 'maddeningly', 'funny', 'asides', 'quickly', 'paced', '82-minute', 'running', 'time', 'Pamploma', 'bulls', 'Running', 'Jew', 'Kazakh', 'villagers', 'attack', 'couple', 'giant', 'papier-mch', 'eacute', 'puppets', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Jew', 'who', 'turn', 'giant', 'egg', 'local', 'children', 'beat', 'furiously', 'sticks', 'Other', 'scenes', 'have', 'Borat', 'erroneously', 'presuming', 'hotel', 'elevator', 'room', 'being', 'semi-attentive', 'student', 'amazingly', 'tolerant', 'instructors', 'lessons', 'comedy', 'driving', 'movie', 'Cohen', 'upping', 'ante', 'yielding', 'even', 'more', 'comic', 'dividends', 'question', 'gun', 'store', 'clerk', 'best', 'weapon', 'kill', 'Jews', 'answered', 'hesitation', 'B', 'B', 'owned', 'kindly', 'Jewish', 'couple', 'scene', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'conservative', 'Southern', 'dinner', 'party', 'ugly', 'when', 'Borat', 'overweight', 'black', 'prostitute', 'guest', 'aging', 'cowboy', 'who', 'bigotry', 'spew', 'freely', 'rodeo', 'trio', 'frat', 'boys', 'South', 'Carolina', 'who', 'enthusiastically', 'share', 'supremely', 'sexist', 'attitudes', 'most', 'infamously', 'extended', 'naked', 'wrestling', 'match', 'Borat', 'grotesque', 'Azamat', 'up', 'convention', 'mortgage', 'brokers', 'scenes', 'expose', 'raw', 'nerve', 'concurrently', 'offensive', 'truthful', 'hilariously', 'comic.Credit', 'needs', 'go', 'director', 'Larry', 'Charles', 'who', 'venture', 'same', 'type', 'deadpan', 'eacute', 'showed', 'HBO', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'screenplay', 'Cohen', 'Anthony', 'Hines', 'Peter', 'Baynham', 'Dan', 'Mazer', 'loose', 'structure', 'what', 'be', 'series', 'staged', 'scenes', 'non-actors', 'anything', 'else', 'Cohen', 'major', 'accomplishment', 'can', 'make', 'Borat', 'anti-Semitic', 'sexist', 'homophobe', 'still', 'have', 'come', 'amiable', 'cheek-kissing', 'fellow', 'full', 'innocently', 'executed', 'malapropisms', ""'m"", 'sure', 'easily', 'offended', 'will', 'continue', 'express', 'disgust', 'more', 'adventurous', 'brace', 'comedy', 'will', 'make', 'roar', 'laughter', 'giving', 'unsettling', 'feeling', 'recognition', 'quite', 'trick', 'Cohen', 'company', 'pull', 'off', 'superbly']",N/A

Sacha Baron Cohen is a comical genius. The Cambridge-educated Brit addresses cultural, sexual, and religious issues in this film, and does it in a way that makes one laugh.We are also shown a very sick, dark side of America, such as at the bullriding event, where an old cowboy shows how anti-gay he is and basically agrees with Cohen ( in character, of course, as Borat) that gays should be killed. We also hear the cries of the crowd when Borat says he supports the war 'of terror' ( no one seems to pick up on the fact that he says ' of terror'n as the crowd screams in agreement. Just showing how stupid some parts of this country are...).If you are Jewish, just know when you go into the film that Cohen himself is; there are a lot of anti Jewish jokes/comments, but they are done on purpose by Cohen.One of the saddest, but educational, moments of the film for me is when Borat hitches a ride with some college students. The boys are absolutely gross, and are the epitomy of stupid frat guys. They basically state that they want to screw loads of chicks and would never date any of them, and want them to kind of be slave-esque. They then say that they would never have any respect for the chicks they sleep with.I am a chick, and I am NOT some feminist, but I went to a hockey school in Minnisota when I was living in the States, and the guys at this school ( it was a high school and middle school, btw) were EXACTLY the same; many of the young girls were severly sexually harassed.I myself was backed into a corner by two huge sadistic hockey players who would not let me leave until I 'put out'.luckily a teacher came, as if they hadn't who knows.And worse things have happened at my school by these sick brats that later in life ended up raping women, and one went to jail at the age of 17.Anyhow, I was glad the film showed this side of the States.

I know I could not come within a million miles of doing any of that.I wonder what Cohen is like in person. When he is in character, he is vile. And dead funny.

That is the lesson of Borat.The premise--an Eastern European man from a third world culture comes to the U.S. to learn about our ways and make a documentary-- is full of comic possibilities.  And indeed there are many funny moments as Borat, who doesn't know enough to be politically correct, says and does outrageous things.  For example, when he tries to greet strangers on the streets of NYC by kissing the men, or when he tries to negotiate the price of a luxury hotel room as if he were in a Turkish Bazaar.  These are hilarious scenes.  And there are plenty more throughout the film.And there is sharp satire in some of the scenes.  Like when Borat announces to a rodeo crowd that he supports America's ""War of Terror"" and gets rousing applause, or when he crashes a Southern Revival meeting and finds ""Mr. Jesus"".But there is a thin line between satire and plain mean-spirited offensiveness, and this film crosses the line repeatedly in search of cheap laughs.  It's clear that many of the film's unwitting co-stars are real people who haven't been clued in, and think they are participating in a real documentary.  Often, these people become the butt of many of the jokes, as the film makes them look racist, ignorant, or just incompetent.  Audiences seem to enjoy laughing at the flaws of others.  But in the end the joke is on us.

The possible exception here would be in NYC, since New Yorkers can be quick (and in this case, correct) to assign boundaries to those who have none (Borat). And you thought the character wanted to head west just to hook up with Pamela Anderson... No - methinks he was seeking better opportunities to exploit others.I'm as eager to expose bigots as anyone, but these so-called attempts largely fall flat and don't ring true at all. OK; the rodeo guy was a jerk but big deal. Even the frat boys were much ado about nothing. I mean, since when do drunken pack/party animals NOT talk trash, for crying out loud?!And beyond that, most of the people that Borat/Cohen sought to browbeat/humilate were very gracious/patient at coping with increasingly imposing and frightening situations.

Especially when the Golden Globe nominations  pegged both the film and the star as candidates for potential honors!!!!  And though many very fine reviewers find this film worthy of praise, the response after viewing the piece in a theater packed with people howling with laughter - again, for this viewer - was one of being appalled.Comedy is an art, an art that magnifies human foibles and allows a different viewpoint to make even sad aspects of life appear humorous. Dark comedy can be cruel when the writing is acerbically witty and smart.  What BORAT seems to have done is costume and scene change a standup comedy routine bent on grossing out its audience and choosing a demeaning manner instead of a parody to lash out at the multiple groups it attacks, be those the people of Kazakhstan, Pentecostal Holiness churches, drunk sexist/racist teenagers, feminists, businessmen, actors, Jews, homosexuals, rodeo folks, genteel Southerners, TV talk show hosts/weathermen, etc.Production wise the filming is crude, the storyline is plotted to look as though it were spontaneous candid camera takes (yet credits a long list of writers including Cohen), and the flatline character of Borat is as predictable as the potty mouth humor it accompanies.  But apparently the public wants this type of entertainment on the screens: the film is raking in millions for the effrontery of Sacha Baron Cohen.  Have we really arrived at a state where our choices range from comic book hero flicks to gory slasher flicks to the base, crude, and thoughtless antics of extended comedy hour routines?

It is not, as some people have said, one of the greatest comedies ever made, nor it is particularly good satire.  Many scenes are really just done to provoke people, and this they do very well.  It's not very difficult to offend southerners (or anyone else for that matter) when you bring a prostitute to their house, or when you take a dump and bring it down in a bag, or the scene where Borat and his producer run through a hotel naked.  Most of the targets here are quite easy, and there really isn't any wit here at work.  With that said, there are many hilarious scenes, like the opening segment, the driving instructor (who is very funny himself), the weather man (who manages to upstage Borat), Borat's insulting of the feminists, and the camraderie Borat has with some bruthas in the hood.  It may be interesting to note that Borat's encounters with black people in the film are the most congenial, as they are very nice to him and treat him well.  His meetings with white people are usually hostile and confrontational.  This is a film worth seeing, but it's not a revolutionary comedy or anything of the sort.

Other scenes drew laughs that were the type that make you feel guilty for laughing.  Other parts of the movie were simply disgusting.  After reading some of the reviews, it is clear that there is no middle ground when it comes to this movie.  Some want to put it on a pedestal as a brilliant political comedy that pokes fun at America, while others simply lambast it.  I am taking the middle road here.  The movie is funny to watch, with some parts that make you cringe and feel uncomfortable even as an innocent observer.The most troubling aspects of this movie dealt with the sheer mean-spiritedness that some of the scenes featured.  For example, a very sweet jewish couple that ran the bed and breakfast.  Whether or not Cohen is Jewish, the way those people were treated showed little class.  If they were part of the joke, I would not be so disgusted; but I don't think they were.The fight between Cohen and his partner in which they were rolling around nude, served no point other than sick shock value.  How that scene, or the bathroom/dinner table scene serves as political commentary is beyond me.  There is no reason to make this movei more than it is.  It is a slapstick, low brow, comedy with some funny scenes and other scenes that are simply gross and geared towards the type of drunken college kids in the R.V. that Borat got drunk with.Three stars.

I must say that for the most part this movie was really funny.This is the story of Borat, a Kazakh, who is sent to America to learn America's ways and bring them back to Kazakhstan.  This is a mockumentary, where they mimic the style of a documentary.  While in America Borat seeks out Pamela Anderson to be his new bride after he learns of his wife's death.  Borat crosses America to get to Los Angeles in search of bride to be and gets into ridiculous situations one after another.Some of the skits of the movie are as follows:Borat on the subway where it pretty much shows that all New Yorkers are overly hostile pricks.  With the U.N. located right in the heart of this overly bitter city no wonder we have the problems we do.Borat going to comedy counselor who has got be the unfunniest person possible.  How can this guy possibly teach humor?Borat going to see the feminists, Give me a smile pussycatBorat calling a fat hooker to come uninvited to an extremely conservative southern dinner party.The list goes on and on with situations where things could not be going worse but people simply take it very politely (except NY) because they think this guy is foreign and simply does not know what he is doing is wrong.  The only part I had a problem with was when he was at the Jewish Guest House.  I understand what Cohen, a devout Jew, was trying to do with these types of skits but this one was off target.I think Cohen's type of comedy is also an important social tool and exposes people's ignorance and bigotry.

Surprisingly, it is also good-hearted beneath its boorish exterior.Sacha Baron Cohen is a comic genius -- a man whose exquisitely planned bits of anarchy are strung together with an unexpected intelligence and sophistication. Plots lines interweave and resolve; comic elements are raised several times; characters develop, have conflicts and grow. All this in a film whose main attraction is that it contains scenes shot with unwitting actors. It's like viewing a beautiful watercolor painting, only to learn that it was composed in ten minutes by a man licking the canvas with a tongue colored by popsicles. The sheer talent required makes the feat even more impressive.""Borat"" mostly avoids mere gross-out humor in favor of attacks on the pomposity of the upper classes and on and the hyper-politeness and inherent prickliness of many Americans. Cohen continually tests the boundaries of what we will tolerate, delighting in showing us the critical moments when our feelings overcome our breeding. And he loves to show us being as vile and racist as his lead. Hearing a Texan advise Borat to shave his mustache in order to look more Italian (ethnic but acceptable) than Muslim (unacceptably ethnic) was to witness the moronic underbelly of the national racial conversation. Watching a pastor run out when a hooker crashes a dinner party is to underline how far we have come from the One who invited prostitutes into his company.""Borat"" is not for everyone. Its vulgarity is pretty extreme, though restrained enough to be believable. Watching Borat and a fat man wrestle in the nude (with sighting of male genitals) is not a sight most would sign up for. Still, it's amazing that even this scene fits in comfortably with the rest of the film. ""Borat"" surprises by taking its actors seriously while satirizing the rest of the planet's inhabitants. The only distraction was the meddlesome question of how much of the movie was staged, how much was completely acted and how much partially staged.Definitely a movie worth watching for those who appreciate jabs at anti-semites, rich Americans and the occasional swimming bear.",5,An intelligent farce,1163376000,"11 13, 2006",2006,2250,"['Borat', 'movie', 'crude', 'vulgar', 'outrageous', 'offensive', 'also', 'hilarious', 'biting', 'work', 'satirical', 'brilliance', 'Surprisingly', 'also', 'good-hearted', 'beneath', 'boorish', 'exterior.Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'comic', 'genius', 'man', 'exquisitely', 'planned', 'bits', 'anarchy', 'are', 'strung', 'together', 'unexpected', 'intelligence', 'sophistication', 'Plots', 'lines', 'interweave', 'resolve', 'comic', 'elements', 'are', 'raised', 'several', 'times', 'characters', 'develop', 'have', 'conflicts', 'grow', 'film', 'main', 'attraction', 'scenes', 'shot', 'unwitting', 'actors', 'viewing', 'beautiful', 'watercolor', 'painting', 'only', 'learn', 'was', 'composed', 'ten', 'minutes', 'man', 'licking', 'canvas', 'tongue', 'colored', 'popsicles', 'sheer', 'talent', 'required', 'feat', 'even', 'more', 'impressive', 'Borat', 'mostly', 'mere', 'gross-out', 'humor', 'favor', 'attacks', 'pomposity', 'upper', 'classes', 'hyper-politeness', 'inherent', 'prickliness', 'many', 'Americans', 'Cohen', 'continually', 'boundaries', 'what', 'will', 'tolerate', 'delighting', 'showing', 'critical', 'moments', 'when', 'feelings', 'overcome', 'breeding', 'show', 'being', 'vile', 'racist', 'lead', 'Hearing', 'Texan', 'advise', 'Borat', 'shave', 'mustache', 'order', 'look', 'more', 'Italian', 'ethnic', 'acceptable', 'Muslim', 'unacceptably', 'ethnic', 'was', 'witness', 'moronic', 'underbelly', 'national', 'racial', 'conversation', 'Watching', 'pastor', 'run', 'out', 'when', 'hooker', 'dinner', 'party', 'underline', 'how', 'far', 'have', 'come', 'One', 'who', 'invited', 'prostitutes', 'company', 'Borat', 'not', 'everyone', 'vulgarity', 'pretty', 'extreme', 'though', 'restrained', 'enough', 'be', 'believable', 'Watching', 'Borat', 'fat', 'man', 'wrestle', 'nude', 'sighting', 'male', 'genitals', 'not', 'sight', 'most', 'would', 'sign', 'up', 'Still', 'amazing', 'even', 'scene', 'comfortably', 'rest', 'film', 'Borat', 'surprises', 'taking', 'actors', 'seriously', 'satirizing', 'rest', 'planet', 'inhabitants', 'only', 'distraction', 'was', 'meddlesome', 'question', 'how', 'much', 'movie', 'was', 'staged', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'completely', 'acted', 'how', 'much', 'partially', 'staged.Definitely', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'who', 'appreciate', 'jabs', 'anti-semites', 'rich', 'Americans', 'occasional', 'swimming', 'bear']",N/A

After viewing this I thought it was silly to an extent regarding these culture clashes. The way the film is made is quite unorthodox because there are few actors and the main part of characters are people who really think they are talking to a reporter from Kazakhstan, just a candid camera. It is not surprising the huge controversy aroused as some of the people tricked into the 'documentary' have already sued Cohen.The film is funny and you will sure laugh at one stage or another. But there are many clich&eacute;s and stereotypes that Cohen uses as he wishes presenting a subjective vision of society. First of all, he could have used a fake country instead of Kazakhstan. It would not been so easy to trick some of the 'victims' into the 'movie film' but the comical effect would have been the same without offending anyone. Just like Molvania from the guys of the hilarious travel guides from Jetlag Travel (from which I think Cohen gets some of the inspiration).Then, there is the Jew issue. Although Borat (and all Kazakhstan according to the movie) is afraid of Jews and hates them profoundly, the film is not offensive to Jews at all. Jews pictured in the film are very nice people and the display of hatred against Jewish is so over stated and absurd that the irony is far from subtle. It cannot be any other way as Cohen is a Jew himself. However this is used as excuse: ""Look, I'm laughing at me making jokes about Jews... now I am legitimated to laugh at anyone as I wish"".The target of Cohen criticism is clear, the white Christian traditional southern people. He laughs at some evangelists in a church, high class republican southern people, drunk college guys, people attending a Rodeo... using sometimes hidden and sometime obvious insults, always protected by a camera and the ""I am from another culture, you should be respectful"". Some of the people pictured could be idiots but you can find idiots in every single community in the world. In fact, outside the USA the film has been taken as an opportunity to laugh at those type of Americans. The rhythm of the movie is a little uneven with some slow spots making the short 80 minutes of movie a little bit too much.

1047358,A3CLUIYGGD44IR,B000MMMT9G,John McConnell,"[4, 5]","Why a review of Borat when so much has already been written?Because what I have yet to see mentioned in any review is that Borat the character is an Elizabethan court jester magically transported to the twenty-first century. Historically, court jesters up to the Renaissance were typically midgets spouting vulgarities. (Freud touches on this aspect of the development and rise of European court jesters in hisTOTEM AND TABOO.) But as the intellectual life of European courts intensified during the Renaissance, court jesters became more and more sophisticated comic powerhouses of Shavian wit who furthermore enjoyed blanket protection from their royal patrons. You fiddled with the fool at your peril. Renaissance fools were the short-lived but brilliant apogee of centuries of court humor, slowly dying out as a protected class after the reign of Henry VIII.This modern comedy reprises all that is best in Shakespearean comedy. In the Shakespearean plays, the fools are what ground us to our own humanity. They cut through the guff, no matter how much guff there is, seeing through and past (or somehow ignorant of) ossified social conventions of what's ""normal"" and ""proper"". They are, in other words, the proverbial ""breath of fresh air"" that makes us smile and laugh. Indeed, the general judgment of the Fool is he is the smart one; it is we who are the real fools. Shakespeare's fools range from the brilliant (King Lear's court jester), to the wisely witty (Feste in Twelfth Night) to the merely witty (Touchstone in As You Like It) to the cowardly (Sir John Falstaff) to the truly benighted (Dogberry in Much Ado About Nothing). Clearly Borat is a modern Dogberry.If there is a ""law"" in Shakespeare's plays, it centers around the Fool. As long as the Fool is with you, as long as society tolerates the Fool, you are safe and society is healthy (or at least retains some measure of health). A society that tolerates the Fool is a society with hope and humor and self-knowledge. When the Fool vanishes, there is nothing left to halt the spread of hypocrisy and destructiveness: In other words, political correctness. The Fool is the one we can always rely on to tell us, ""The Emperor has no clothes"". Because in the final analysis, the Fool embodies Truth. And Truth is sustenance to every human soul. Borat the Fool is benighted but kind, and does us all a very great service by reminding us - even in the twenty-first century - that ""The Emperor has no clothes"".Awesome comedy.",4,"Say ""cheese""",1188518400,"08 31, 2007",2007,2486,"['Why', 'review', 'Borat', 'when', 'so', 'much', 'already', 'been', 'written', 'what', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'mentioned', 'review', 'Borat', 'character', 'Elizabethan', 'court', 'jester', 'magically', 'transported', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'Historically', 'court', 'jesters', 'up', 'Renaissance', 'were', 'typically', 'midgets', 'spouting', 'vulgarities', 'Freud', 'touches', 'aspect', 'development', 'rise', 'European', 'court', 'jesters', 'hisTOTEM', 'AND', 'TABOO', 'intellectual', 'life', 'European', 'courts', 'intensified', 'Renaissance', 'court', 'jesters', 'became', 'more', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'comic', 'powerhouses', 'Shavian', 'wit', 'who', 'furthermore', 'enjoyed', 'blanket', 'protection', 'royal', 'patrons', 'fiddled', 'fool', 'peril', 'Renaissance', 'fools', 'were', 'short-lived', 'brilliant', 'apogee', 'centuries', 'court', 'humor', 'slowly', 'dying', 'out', 'protected', 'class', 'reign', 'Henry', 'VIII.This', 'modern', 'comedy', 'best', 'Shakespearean', 'comedy', 'Shakespearean', 'plays', 'fools', 'are', 'what', 'ground', 'own', 'humanity', 'cut', 'guff', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'guff', 'seeing', 'past', 'somehow', 'ignorant', 'ossified', 'social', 'conventions', 'what', 'normal', 'proper', 'are', 'other', 'words', 'proverbial', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'smile', 'laugh', 'Indeed', 'general', 'judgment', 'Fool', 'smart', 'one', 'who', 'are', 'real', 'fools', 'Shakespeare', 'fools', 'range', 'brilliant', 'King', 'Lear', 'court', 'jester', 'wisely', 'witty', 'Feste', 'Twelfth', 'Night', 'merely', 'witty', 'Touchstone', 'As', 'cowardly', 'Sir', 'John', 'Falstaff', 'truly', 'benighted', 'Dogberry', 'Much', 'Ado', 'Nothing', 'Clearly', 'Borat', 'modern', 'Dogberry.If', 'law', 'Shakespeare', 'plays', 'Fool', 'As', 'long', 'Fool', 'as', 'long', 'society', 'Fool', 'are', 'safe', 'society', 'healthy', 'least', 'measure', 'health', 'society', 'Fool', 'society', 'hope', 'humor', 'self-knowledge', 'When', 'Fool', 'vanishes', 'nothing', 'left', 'halt', 'spread', 'hypocrisy', 'destructiveness', 'other', 'words', 'political', 'correctness', 'Fool', 'one', 'can', 'always', 'rely', 'tell', 'Emperor', 'clothes', 'final', 'analysis', 'Fool', 'embodies', 'Truth', 'Truth', 'sustenance', 'human', 'soul', 'Borat', 'Fool', 'benighted', 'kind', 'very', 'great', 'service', 'reminding', 'even', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'Emperor', 'clothes', '.Awesome', 'comedy']",N/A

Borat, the legendaery comedy movie starring our friend from Eastern Europe, has two purposes, to shock you and make you laugh your heiny off.In all seriousness, only a Jewish person could get away with a movie like this. If a non-Jew were to make these kinds of jokes, this film would have probably never seen the light of day. Much like a black stand-up comedian who has a license to say N****r, Borat can show an oversized female Jewish character laying an egg and then having children crush it. This is the kind of humor that politicians in America have to ignore. If anyone caught them laughing, they would be run out of town.I am not saying this film will be funny for everyone. Maybe not everyone likes to see a 300 pound, hairy and disgustingly obese man run around naked, getting bit on the teet, and having his massive bare buttocks slamming down on another man's face, but when you buy a ticket on the Borat Express, you got to stay on for the ride until the end.To me this film was refreshing. In a time when over-budget, A-list star movies leave you wanting more, Borat looks and feels much more like an independent film. I sincerely hope that one of the reasons this film was made was to strike Hollywood where it hurt. You can make a funny and entertaining movie without a billion dollars. I only wish Borat had a derogatory joke about Steven Spielburg, but insulting the most successful director of all time (and a fellow Jew), well maybe even Borat has his limits.I personally enjoyed every part of this movie. Some of my favorite scenes were the yard sale (""I come to collect your tears Gypsy""), the hotel room wrestling match (""How dare you make hand party with my Pam-eel""), and of course the village (""Dis is my sister, she is number 4 prostitute in all Khakistan""). I am not running for office and I have no need to be PC. This movie made me laugh out loud several times. From the driving lesson to the dinner on Secede Ave. From the rodeo to the gun store (""What is best gun to kill a Jew?""). This film is something I can watch again and again.The only thing I did not understand was the Pamela Anderson part. Right before he turned on Baywatch, a scene of Married with Children came on. Peg Bundy (Katey Sagal) was the sexiest woman to ever sashay across a TV screen. If I was Borat I would have wnet after her in a heartbeat.

1047361,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B000MMMT9G,Jonathan Appleseed,"[2, 3]","Like Jerry Seinfeld, Sasha Cohen goes straight for the laugh, and isn't concerned with any ""message"". Like Trey Parker and Matt Stone, co-creators ofSouth Park, in ""Borat..."", many of the laughs fall into the category of toilet humor. This movie is my main exposure to Cohen. I saw a few episodes of his TV show prior to the movie, but just like watching a few episodes of South Park couldn't possibly prepare me forSouth Park - Bigger, Longer & Uncut, I had no idea what I was in for.While Cohen isn't concerned about a ""message"", we see one immediately when he arrives in New York. His overeager attempts to greet New Yorkers with kisses are met with hysterical results. One man quite literally runs into and down the street to escape him; others threaten him with great bodily harm.Borat is supposedly in the ""U.S. and A"" to film a documentary for his country, Kazakhstan. While in his hotel room, he sees an episode of Baywatch, and falls in love with C.J. During a meeting with feminists - hysterical - he finds that she lives in Malibu, CA, and so decides to travel cross-country and ask Pamela Anderson to marry him.I won't go through the so-called plot, because the fun is in the spontaneity of the humor, but there is one incident I'd like to address.On the way to California, he schedules various stops to learn more about American culture. One such stop is at a rodeo in Roanoke, VA, where he angles his way into singing the national anthem - but he chooses to sing it with the words of his country's own anthem supplanting ours. Before singing, he espoused great support for the war on terror, and hoped that George Bush would drink the blood of every single [Iraqi]. This was met with thunderous applause. But then he started to sing, and asserted that Kazakhstan was the greatest country in the world. What struck me as odd here was that nobody started to boo until he declared that Kazakhstan was the #1 exporter of potassium, and that their potassium was the best. Honestly, I don't think anybody knew what they were booing about, other than someone was saying that a country other than theirs was #1. Again, Cohen wasn't going for a message, just a reaction, but we got one loud and clear. It was even clearer in the extras, where news coverage for that event was shown and the newscaster declared that Borat was ""bashing"" everything from the war to the Bush administration, which was a flat-out lie.Borat's trip took him through the South, and as one reviewer indicated, the South has been picked on considerably, and it would have been interesting to inspect the reactions of his radical behavior when applied to Midwesterners. I agree. That would have been an interesting approach. My gut tells me, though, that it wouldn't have been as funny.Borat's fear and hatred of the Jew was, to me, humorous, mainly because they were shown, during one of his ""interviews,"" to be ill-founded and silly. Indeed, that particular scene, where he rented a room from an elderly Jewish couple, spoke loudly to the tumult in the Middle East, and the pointlessness of the hatred that is there so deeply ingrained.The Bonus Features weren't all I hoped them to be. Other than the enlightening Roanoke news broadcast, nothing that had been ""censored"" was as funny or pointed as what was in the film, so those were judicious cuts.Also, the extras were neither subtitled nor closed captioned. I don't understand why, when the movie grossed almost fifteen times what it cost to make (this virtually guaranteeing that the DVD will be successful), they couldn't spend the extra money and subtitle and/or caption the extras, as they did for the film itself. More and more producers of DVDs are doing this now, and for those of us who are hearing impaired, it makes a difference - the difference being that we might not buy a DVD if we don't think the special features/extras will be accessible to us.4 out of 5.",4,Cultural mislearnings,1174953600,"03 27, 2007",2007,3905,"['Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'Sasha', 'Cohen', 'straight', 'laugh', ""n't"", 'concerned', 'message', 'Trey', 'Parker', 'Matt', 'Stone', 'co-creators', 'ofSouth', 'Park', 'Borat', 'many', 'laughs', 'fall', 'category', 'toilet', 'humor', 'movie', 'main', 'exposure', 'Cohen', 'saw', 'few', 'episodes', 'TV', 'show', 'prior', 'movie', 'just', 'watching', 'few', 'episodes', 'South', 'Park', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'prepare', 'forSouth', 'Park', 'Bigger', 'Longer', 'Uncut', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'for.While', 'Cohen', ""n't"", 'concerned', 'message', 'see', 'one', 'immediately', 'when', 'New', 'York', 'overeager', 'attempts', 'greet', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'kisses', 'are', 'met', 'hysterical', 'results', 'One', 'man', 'quite', 'literally', 'street', 'escape', 'others', 'threaten', 'great', 'bodily', 'harm.Borat', 'supposedly', 'U.S.', 'A', 'film', 'documentary', 'country', 'Kazakhstan', 'hotel', 'room', 'episode', 'Baywatch', 'love', 'C.J', 'meeting', 'feminists', 'hysterical', 'Malibu', 'CA', 'so', 'decides', 'travel', 'cross-country', 'ask', 'Pamela', 'Anderson', 'marry', 'him.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'so-called', 'plot', 'fun', 'spontaneity', 'humor', 'one', 'incident', ""'d"", 'like', 'address.On', 'way', 'California', 'various', 'stops', 'learn', 'more', 'American', 'culture', 'One', 'such', 'stop', 'rodeo', 'Roanoke', 'VA', 'where', 'way', 'singing', 'national', 'anthem', 'sing', 'words', 'country', 'own', 'anthem', 'supplanting', 'ours', 'singing', 'espoused', 'great', 'support', 'war', 'terror', 'hoped', 'George', 'Bush', 'would', 'drink', 'blood', 'single', '[', 'Iraqi', ']', 'was', 'met', 'thunderous', 'applause', 'then', 'started', 'sing', 'asserted', 'Kazakhstan', 'was', 'greatest', 'country', 'world', 'What', 'struck', 'odd', 'here', 'was', 'nobody', 'started', 'boo', 'declared', 'Kazakhstan', 'was', '1', 'exporter', 'potassium', 'potassium', 'was', 'best', 'Honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anybody', 'knew', 'what', 'were', 'booing', 'about', 'other', 'someone', 'was', 'saying', 'country', 'other', 'was', '1', 'Again', 'Cohen', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'message', 'just', 'reaction', 'got', 'one', 'loud', 'clear', 'was', 'even', 'clearer', 'extras', 'where', 'news', 'coverage', 'event', 'was', 'shown', 'newscaster', 'declared', 'Borat', 'was', 'bashing', 'everything', 'war', 'Bush', 'administration', 'was', 'flat-out', 'lie.Borat', 'trip', 'took', 'South', 'one', 'reviewer', 'indicated', 'South', 'been', 'picked', 'considerably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'inspect', 'reactions', 'radical', 'behavior', 'when', 'applied', 'Midwesterners', 'agree', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'approach', 'gut', 'tells', 'though', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'funny.Borat', 'fear', 'hatred', 'Jew', 'was', 'humorous', 'mainly', 'were', 'shown', 'one', 'interviews', 'be', 'ill-founded', 'silly', 'Indeed', 'particular', 'scene', 'where', 'rented', 'room', 'elderly', 'Jewish', 'couple', 'spoke', 'loudly', 'tumult', 'Middle', 'East', 'pointlessness', 'hatred', 'there', 'so', 'deeply', 'ingrained.The', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'were', ""n't"", 'all', 'hoped', 'be', 'Other', 'enlightening', 'Roanoke', 'news', 'broadcast', 'nothing', 'had', 'been', 'censored', 'was', 'funny', 'pointed', 'what', 'was', 'film', 'were', 'judicious', 'cuts.Also', 'extras', 'were', 'neither', 'subtitled', 'closed', 'captioned', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'when', 'movie', 'grossed', 'almost', 'fifteen', 'times', 'what', 'cost', 'make', 'virtually', 'guaranteeing', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'successful', 'could', ""n't"", 'spend', 'extra', 'money', 'subtitle', 'and/or', 'caption', 'extras', 'did', 'film', 'More', 'more', 'producers', 'DVDs', 'are', 'doing', 'now', 'who', 'are', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'difference', 'difference', 'being', 'might', 'not', 'buy', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'special', 'features/extras', 'will', 'be', 'accessible', 'us.4', '5']",N/A

The elderly Jewish couple that ran it were clearly very sweet and trusting people and I found it to be immoral whether Cohen is Jewish or not.The dining club deserved to be exposed- especially since they put up with all of his nonsense until his black girlfriend showed up and they went berzerk. However the jab at the guys wife before that should have earned Borat some broken teeth from the husband.Finally the naked male wrestling scene is DISGUSTING.  Trust me on this one.The Good:His time in New York is so funny that in the movie theater people were laughing so hard and so loudly that we were missing parts.Making fun of the hicks at the stadium saying ""We support Bush's War of Terror!!!!"" etc. was really funny.Exposing the racist frat boys was priceless.Bagging Pamela Anderson- classic!!!

On the whole, however, the slapsticky, crude and insulting stuff simply came to be too much .Cohen is a 'comedian' who makes his living by betraying people's trust and demeaning them; his formula is to scrape the barrel through pandering to the worst instincts in marginalized folks who revel in seeing OTHERS as fools.  This, of course, is the last resort of unfunny  comedians; actually, Cohen is a jester, rather than a comedian and is probably incapable of creating a genuinely funny, open-hearted and entertaining product.In short, this film belongs to the Jackass genre by having nothing to say and sinking to the lowest common denominator.  It cynically masquerades itself as 'a fight against intolerance, racism and ignorance', while in reality representing a textbook example of media opportunism. Basically, it combines pseudo-outrageousness, bad art and lack of acting talent to get two minutes in the limelight for a guy whose claim to fame is that he has no social inhibitions.

1047369,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000MMMT9G,Kaya Savas,"[18, 28]","MOVIE: Borat is the brainchild of Sacha Baron Cohen, an incredibly versatile and hilarious British comedian. Sacha Baron Cohen is a shape shifter, he has created characters and has basically become those characters, Ali G and Borat are his most famous. Borat is a spin-off movie from the Borat segments we saw in his TV show, Da Ali G Show. In the short segment we had Borat, a TV journalist from Kazakhstan who is basically trying to understand the ways of American culture. The film is the exact same premise except on a feature length scale.In this mockumentary we have Borat who travels to the USA under a grant from his government in hopes of learning ways to benefit the lifestyle in his home country of Kazakhstan. In the midst of his journey he happens to watch an episode of Baywatch and now wants to go to California to marry Pamela Anderson. That's your basic structure, but that's not what makes this movie flat out hilarious.What makes this movie extremely funny are the various social commentaries on our culture and religion worldwide. We travel from the east coast to the west coast experiencing all of the United States' diversity. In one scene he sits down with an instructor to teach him manners while eating with upper class white Americans, and he asks if it's appropriate to bring a guest. So, he does bring a guest, and that guest is a black hooker. I mean, just watching him making fun of ourselves is absolutely hilarious. In one hilarious scene he and his producer stay at a bed and breakfast at a home owned by an old Jewish couple. In the middle of the night he spots two cockroaches and they flip out because they think the Jews changed form and are trying to kill them. They stand there jumping and screaming while throwing money at the cockroaches. In another scene he sits down with feminists and asks if teaching women would be a problem since their brains are the size of a squirrel's. It's scenes like these that make Borat incredibly smart and probably the funniest movie you have seen in a while. The film pushes the limits in terms of shock value in some places, for example, a nude wrestling match between Borat and his manager in their hotel room when Borat catches him masturbating to a picture of Pamela Anderson. So, the film has two sides, it can be at times gross out humor but not without it's biting social satire.Larry Charles directed this brilliant comedic movie, and while the meat of the film comes from Sacha Baron Cohen's writing you cannot deny the style. Shot as low budget as possible, Larry Charles has made this his own personal style. Some of the scenes are set up so perfectly that you have to credit Charles for the direction. When Borat first arrives in New York we suddenly hear Harry Nilsson's ""Everybody's Talkin"", and then we begin a little reference to Midnight Cowboy as we see Borat wandering New York City. Charles is best known for directing and working on Seinfeld and he stayed with Larry David to help develop and direct some episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm. Larry Charles also has written and directed episodes of Entourage and directed the Bob Dylan starring film, Masked & Anonymous.ACTING: Sacha Baron Cohen is the star of this movie, and he is the genius who plays Borat. What many people don't know is that Sacha Baron Cohen is British and he is Jewish. He is the most versitile comedian working today in my opinion. He can transform into anybody, hide his accent, and completely embody the persona. He is Ali G, Borat, he co-starred in Talladega Nights as Will Ferrel's French nemesis, and he was the voice of King Julyan in Madagascar. The character of Borat is not offensive to the people of Kazakhstan as many people are complaining, it's a serious jab at our intolerant culture. It doesn't show his ignorance, but rather the ignorance and intolerance of the American people. He created one of the funniest characters in film history.BOTTOM LINE: Borat is an incredible social satire that will have you laughing till it hurts. It is not only a brilliant satire on our culture, but a crude and hilarious way of looking at it. The only problem with this movie is that it is in fact based on a segment that was only 10 minutes of the Da Ali G Show. In ways it does start to drag and it slows down in a few places, and that's mainly because it was originally developed for television.

The widescreen edition is great and the special features are okay.  Sacha Baron Cohen plays Borat, a native of Kazakstan and also a reporter from that country who comes to America in the hopes of learning something constructive to take back and apply to his own culture.  What the film really does is show a hilarious, if often times disturbing and yet comical view of American culture through Borat's eyes.  From his purchase of an ""auto car"" to falling in love with Pamela Anderson after watching an episode of Baywatch, it was fun to follow him through his journey from New York to California.  Cohen is great because he makes the character he plays very believable.  Whether it was the Rodeo, the Bear they bought for protection or the etiquette lessons, the film was highly entertaining.  This kind of humor is not for everyone but I know people who would have found some of it to be a turn off still ended up laughing a lot.

Borat was fun to watch as he made his way through the United States looking for people to agitate, disgust, anger, etc.  However, in this film, ""Borat:  Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,"" Cohen runs the comedy well dry.  The scripted moments of this film were the weakest points in the movie.  **SPOILERS**  The incident with the bear, the bickering with his producer, and the lonely nights pining for Pamela Anderson were lukewarm at best.  I will say that the celebrated ""naked fight"" is very, very funny and is actually a highlight of the film.  However, Cohen is at his best when he confronts people in candid moments.  Be it at a church service, in the company of drunken frat boys, or at the dinner table, Cohen knows how to get funny (or at least brutally honest) responses from those he encounters.  These types of interactions show just how cruel, ignorant, kind, proud, forgiving, or oblivious people can be when put into certain situations.**End Spoilers**The film itself is okay, but it's nothing more than an overdone ""Borat"" skit that is best taken in small doses.  The DVD provides a few deleted scenes (some of the best being with the numerous police officers that Borat interacts with). It also includes a report on the Borat incident at a rodeo and a few other things that neither add to or take away from the film.If you're familiar with Borat already and enjoy his antics, consider this a strong rental.  If you're easily offended, don't bother.  Overall, ""Borat"" is a funny film that has equal parts hilarity and unfunny idiocy in it.

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[227, 273]","I guess I am shocked at how divisive this film seems to be--it's apparently another in the camp of ""love it"" or ""hate it.""  I was familiar with Sasha Baron Cohen and the Borat character from HBO's ""Da Ali G Show"".  While I was amused by this reprehensible, yet surprisingly innocent ""Kazahstanian,"" I was skeptical about a full fledged big screen treatment.  Turning a comedy skit into a feature movie is a ""iffy"" proposition, at best.  Take a look at almost every Saturday Night Live adaptation for corroboration.  I'd have to say, then, that I was pleasantly surprised--Borat is a winner.Part scripted, partly hidden camera improv, partly ""Jackass"" tomfoolery--you're never quite sure what is to be believed in ""Borat"".  Some may feel that this limits the film's effectiveness as commentary, but I feel this enhances it's comedic appeal.  For there is such unbridled outrageousness to be had in ""Borat,"" it's hard not to be caught up in the spirit.  I probably laughed more consistently within the framework of this spare 83 minute film than I have all year.  Some of it is dumb humor, to be sure--some of it was shock value or disbelief.But a large part of the humor comes from real life.  By playing the moronic, offensive imbecile--Cohen, and thus Borat, expose a cavalier prejudice, hypocrisy, and/or intolerance that exists within American culture.  Whether it's buying a gun to kill Jews, viewing women as sex objects to be violated, or supporting the genocide of our enemies--Borat always finds willing subjects to engage, people who in one way or another identify with these barbaric ideas.It's tempting to dismiss Borat as offensive nonsense, I know many have already stated that opinion.  It might also be tempting for others to embrace ""Borat"" as one of the more unapologetic and politically relevant films in quite some time.  But I don't think it is attempting anything quite so significant--and that, in truth, may be it's greatest success.  It walks the line unlike any other film in recent memory.  It has elicited much love from fans and major critics and much hatred from it's detractors.  This power to provoke such passion, such debate--be it feelings, emotions, thoughts, ideas--that is the film's crowning achievement.  This crazy little film is not only one of the year's funniest films, it has also become one of the year's most talked about.  Who can argue with that?

I laughed non-stop (while shaking my head in wonder at Borat's ""victims"":  Why would they sign releases to let their footage appear in the movie?).Borat never breaks character and keeps the joke up right to the end.  His pride in his run-down country is sweet and his innocence is what makes the movie work.  In the Extras, Borat appears on ""The Tonight Show""...Jay Leno: ""What do you say to people who say your movie is homophobic and anti-Semitic?""Borat:  ""Thank you!""You'll either love it or think it's the most vulgar and offensive movie ever made.

That is why it is called humor.So the movie is about this man who travels across America trying to learn the culture but then it turns into a search for Pamela Anderson in California. Along the way, they stop by at different cities, learning about the different people living there.Sure, the entire movie is about poking fun of homosexuals, women, blacks, Jews, etc. but it doesnt entirely call for so much controversy. The jokes arent even that funny, and sometimes the movie is a little boring.So i can see why some people get offended, but i cant see how this movie is being said to be one of the funniest of the year...its not.Good enough to watch once or twice, but thats about it.",3,"Funny, but not entirely....",1167436800,"12 30, 2006",2006,1001,"['Well', 'so', 'much', 'controversy', 'i', 'had', 'check', 'film', 'out', 'myself.Ive', 'read', 'reviews', 'one', 'end', 'spectrum', 'other', 'well', 'i', 'guess', 'have', 'decide', 'suits', 'depending', 'sense', 'humor.I', 'am', 'pretty', 'open', 'type', 'sense', 'humor', 'even', 'expense', 'others', 'why', 'called', 'movie', 'man', 'who', 'America', 'trying', 'learn', 'culture', 'then', 'search', 'Pamela', 'Anderson', 'California', 'way', 'stop', 'different', 'cities', 'learning', 'different', 'people', 'living', 'there.Sure', 'entire', 'movie', 'poking', 'fun', 'homosexuals', 'women', 'blacks', 'Jews', 'etc', 'entirely', 'call', 'so', 'much', 'controversy', 'jokes', 'arent', 'even', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'movie', 'little', 'boring.So', 'i', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'get', 'offended', 'i', 'cant', 'see', 'how', 'movie', 'being', 'said', 'be', 'one', 'funniest', 'year', 'not.Good', 'enough', 'watch', 'once', 'twice']",N/A
1047381,A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK,B000MMMT9G,"Kurt Harding ""bon vivant""","[3, 4]","OK, so by buying and watching this film, I succumbed to all the hype, some of it utter nonsense, that preceded its release. Masterful spin, I'd say. Anyway, unless you are one who takes everything literally and/or are one of those who doesn't appreciate humor that denigrates (What other kind is there?), then you should find Borat hysterically funny but...But what? Well, the word is about that all of the scenes in Borat (except the one with Pamela Anderson) were spontaneous, that is to say that the people meeting Borat actually thought they were contributing to a documentary about America to be shown on Kazakh TV. I'd say that after watching closely several times that while some people may have been caught off guard, others surely were in on the game. Though New Yorkers' reactions to Borat trying to kiss them is entirely believable, some other scenes were not. I can't imagine the scene at the rodeo where Borat butchered the national anthem, nor can I imagine that Borat could get away with defecating in front of the Trump Towers in full public view without being challenged. The scenes toward the end where Borat and his assistant run nude into a meeting of mortgage brokers taxes its credibility as well. Then there is the scene where Borat sleeps next to a campfire on the steps of a mega-church and hasn't been rousted long before the congregation begins to arrive. Come on!Then there is something that perhaps the film's producers missed: Borat's appearance on the evening news in Jackson MS long before he and his assistant got anywhere near Jackson. Watch closely, unless you are geographically challenged, you'll see what I am saying.Beyond all that, there is a lot to laugh at. Sacha Baron Cohen's character causes you to confront some of the crudest and most outlandish stereotypes about others, particularly about Jews. There is the Running of the Jew back home in Kazakhstan where the object is not to let the Jew get the money, there is the idea that Jews can shift shapes and that the new form can be mollified by throwing money at it (must be a peculiarly Eastern European myth, not even the Nazis tried to sell that), then there is the idea that Jews will cunningly kill, eat and rob Christians. The scene where the traveling pair went to a bed and breakfast that turned out to be owned by an elderly Jewish couple is just hilarious. Other stereotypes are confronted as well: about gypsies, about blacks, about gays, about evangelical Christians and even about Southern whites.Some of the scenes tut-tutted in the press as being horrible I see in retrospect as being just cleverly spun, like the scene where Borat asks the gun-shop owner about which is the best gun with which to defend himself against Jews. The owner told him, but he didn't sell him a gun, did he? Ditto the man in the car lot who told Borat what speed would do the maximum damage to a crowd of gypsies with minimum damage to the Hummer that Borat was trying to buy. If indeed the answer was spontaneous, my view is that the car lot owner considered the question a joke since where would one find a crowd of gypsies to plow into in the US?What's my favorite scene? It's Borat returning to the dinner table at a fancy dining club trying to find out where to dispose of the turd he is carrying in a baggie and the hostess then having to show him how a toilet is used.My caveats aside, don't try to read too much social commentary into Borat though its there for those who seek it. While its not clean, its great fun and some of the deleted scenes featured in the bonus section will have you roaring as well. Some of the movie is downright silly, but overall its still one of the funniest I've seen in a while.",4,Hysterically Funny But...,1175212800,"03 30, 2007",2007,3705,"['OK', 'so', 'buying', 'watching', 'film', 'succumbed', 'hype', 'utter', 'nonsense', 'preceded', 'release', 'Masterful', 'spin', ""'d"", 'say', 'Anyway', 'are', 'one', 'who', 'everything', 'literally', 'are', 'one', 'who', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'humor', 'What', 'other', 'kind', 'there', 'then', 'should', 'find', 'Borat', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'what', 'Well', 'word', 'scenes', 'Borat', 'one', 'Pamela', 'Anderson', 'were', 'spontaneous', 'say', 'people', 'meeting', 'Borat', 'actually', 'thought', 'were', 'contributing', 'documentary', 'America', 'be', 'shown', 'Kazakh', 'TV', ""'d"", 'say', 'watching', 'closely', 'several', 'times', 'people', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'others', 'surely', 'were', 'game', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'reactions', 'Borat', 'trying', 'kiss', 'entirely', 'believable', 'other', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'scene', 'rodeo', 'where', 'Borat', 'butchered', 'national', 'anthem', 'can', 'imagine', 'Borat', 'could', 'get', 'away', 'defecating', 'front', 'Trump', 'Towers', 'full', 'public', 'view', 'being', 'challenged', 'scenes', 'end', 'where', 'Borat', 'assistant', 'run', 'nude', 'meeting', 'mortgage', 'brokers', 'taxes', 'credibility', 'as', 'well', 'Then', 'scene', 'where', 'Borat', 'next', 'campfire', 'steps', 'mega-church', ""n't"", 'been', 'rousted', 'long', 'congregation', 'arrive', 'Come', 'Then', 'something', 'perhaps', 'film', 'producers', 'missed', 'Borat', 'appearance', 'evening', 'news', 'Jackson', 'MS', 'long', 'assistant', 'got', 'anywhere', 'Jackson', 'Watch', 'closely', 'are', 'geographically', 'challenged', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'am', 'saying.Beyond', 'lot', 'laugh', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'character', 'confront', 'crudest', 'most', 'outlandish', 'stereotypes', 'others', 'particularly', 'Jews', 'Running', 'Jew', 'back', 'home', 'Kazakhstan', 'where', 'object', 'not', 'let', 'Jew', 'get', 'money', 'idea', 'Jews', 'can', 'shift', 'shapes', 'new', 'form', 'can', 'be', 'mollified', 'throwing', 'money', 'must', 'be', 'peculiarly', 'Eastern', 'European', 'myth', 'not', 'even', 'Nazis', 'tried', 'sell', 'then', 'idea', 'Jews', 'will', 'cunningly', 'kill', 'eat', 'rob', 'Christians', 'scene', 'where', 'traveling', 'pair', 'went', 'bed', 'breakfast', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'owned', 'elderly', 'Jewish', 'couple', 'just', 'hilarious', 'Other', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'confronted', 'well', 'gypsies', 'blacks', 'about', 'gays', 'about', 'evangelical', 'Christians', 'even', 'Southern', 'whites.Some', 'scenes', 'tut-tutted', 'press', 'being', 'horrible', 'see', 'retrospect', 'being', 'just', 'cleverly', 'spun', 'scene', 'where', 'Borat', 'gun-shop', 'owner', 'best', 'gun', 'defend', 'Jews', 'owner', 'told', 'did', ""n't"", 'sell', 'gun', 'did', 'man', 'car', 'lot', 'who', 'told', 'Borat', 'what', 'speed', 'would', 'do', 'maximum', 'damage', 'crowd', 'gypsies', 'minimum', 'damage', 'Hummer', 'Borat', 'was', 'trying', 'buy', 'indeed', 'answer', 'was', 'spontaneous', 'view', 'car', 'lot', 'owner', 'considered', 'question', 'joke', 'where', 'would', 'one', 'find', 'crowd', 'gypsies', 'plow', 'US', 'What', 'favorite', 'scene', 'Borat', 'returning', 'dinner', 'table', 'fancy', 'dining', 'club', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'dispose', 'turd', 'carrying', 'baggie', 'hostess', 'then', 'having', 'show', 'how', 'toilet', 'used.My', 'caveats', 'aside', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'read', 'too', 'much', 'social', 'commentary', 'Borat', 'who', 'seek', 'not', 'clean', 'great', 'fun', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'featured', 'bonus', 'section', 'will', 'have', 'roaring', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'downright', 'silly', 'overall', 'still', 'one', 'funniest', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while']",N/A

In the theatre I saw Borat in, half the audience was laughing or on the floor while the more conservative audience (usually non-college student adults and older viewers) berated us for laughing at the racial and sexist jokes that clutter Borat.I will admit, Borat goes well over the top in both crude humor and imagry.  The one scene that comes to mind involves wrestling between a naked Borat and his overly obese producer... who is also naked and the fight tends to meander... a lot.  At this point I covered my eyes (while laughing hysterically) and kept demanding the movie Gods to make it stop.  The showing of the full-frontal nudity in males happens twice and while it is seemingly hysterical to myself and other Cohen fans, the general audience in the theatre just gagged or walked out.As for being whitty and satiracle, I found Borat to be hilarious.  I will not say American culture involves inherant violence and desires to kill all people of Iraq (as Borat more or less ""proved"" during the Rodeo scene), but he certainly brought out the worst in everyone he encountered.  The scene where he visits a gun shop to get ""protection from Jews,"" the owner just stands there and changes the subject.  Many saw this as condoning the act when the guy was simply trying to be polite and not cause any trouble.Borat does a great job of taking social norms and taboos and throwing them right into the face of Americans.  For instance, he tries to be friendly on a subway only to be threatened by everyone he encounters and given the social norms in NY, this certainly makes it all the more funny.  Another social norm turned upside down is his treatment of women; when attending a feminist meeting he laughs at the feminists and brings up ""research"" that women's brains are smaller and keeps refering to one feminist as a guy.Pertaining to the candid-camera aspect and the controversy thereof; while I sympathize with the people he was extremely rude to such as the dining society... let's think about this.  If someone acting incredibly stupid shows up with a camera screw and is well-financed; he's either a friend of George Soros or it's a prank.  The fraternity guys claimed they were duped into thinking it was a documentary on the fraternity system and yet they didn't question why a guy from Kazachkstan was doing the filming and he was incredibly stupid.  Not to mention one has to know if he's being filmed and with technology today (particularly youtube etc) the film is going to be distributed.I loved the story; Borat is trying to find Pamela Anderson to make him his wife and it was obvious that one scene where he meets her is staged... but still funny.  Borat encounters many funny figures along the way and his usual antics such as loving women will make crude humor fans laugh.  One of Borat's obvious querps is his disdain for Jews (Cohen is a Jew himself) and the encounter with a Jewish couple at a bed and breakfast, who tried to be very sweet (although it seemed as though it was staged) and trigger the Blair-Witch Project scene that follows.Again, this is very crude humor appealing to college students, teenagers and Cohen fans like myself.  DO NOT SEE THIS is you think you will be offended or are easily offended.  Cannot stress this enough; which does force me to ding Borat to 4-stars because while I found Borat to be a five-star in my book, it does not appeal to the general audience.  This film was very entertaining for my friends and I to see and was worth the wait; we will get the DVD when it comes out as well.",4,Extremely Funny for Satire and Cohen Fans...

Borat and his producer, Azamat go to America to make a documentary on American culture.  This is where things go awry and hilarious.  Borat just cannot understand why people do not do certain things and is puzzled when they ""bared their teeth"".  For example, the 2 quick pecks on the cheeks when greeting is the traditional custom for Borat.  However, Americans resist that particular kind of greeting.Borat cracked me up when he meets diverse Americans, such as gays, Blacks, the upper class, prostitutes, Pamela Anderson and Jews.  What was even more hilarious was when Borat catches Azamat using the Pamela Anderson book as a stimulation for self-pleasure, Borat goes ballistic.  They wrestle in the nude and run out to a conference hall chasing.Now, *Borat* isn't funny every single seconds.  There were a couple that were worthy of a half-chuckle.

But despite what you may think, this isn't just some childish romp through the mud. Borat: Cultural Learnings Of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation Of Kazakhstan is a scathing, heroically appalling comic masterpiece. The humor, filthy as it is, is ridiculously funny. It's a glorious mishmash of sophomoric glee, satirical sneer, and classic misunderstanding-based folly. The film makes excellent use of silence and awkward pauses, almost upping the ante on the Office, and transforms ordinary situations into hilarious ordeals with Seinfeldian skill.What makes the film so incredible is that behind its irresistible comic sheen, there lies a genuinely scathing social commentary- As the film's title character, Sascha Baron Cohen has a knack for bringing out the worst in the people he encounters, revealing the aspects of American culture that most of us would rather ignore. The film explores the darker sentiments of our nation, of the xenophobia, ignorance, and prejudice that still plagues us.

It is a quasi mockumentary, cinema verite style flick. Sasha Baron Cohen plays the character of Borat Sagdiyev, a journalist from the eastern European, third world country of Kazakhstan.Borat travels to the United States to learn American culture and film his experiences in order to bring back his new found knowledge to the masses in Kazakhstan. Along his journey, he interacts with real people with hilarious and eyebrow raising consequences. Borat always stays in character, which means he is alternately offensive and ignorant. Some of the Americans with whom he interacts raise a few eyebrows themselves.There are moments in the film are simply startling and totally outrageous. Others are even amazingly funny. There certainly are scenes in the film that rise to the level of social commentary, while others are simply sophomoric. Still, the film cannot help but entertain those who view the film without pre-conceived notions.

Usually the silly comedy genre (Dumb & Dumber) just doesn't make me laugh.  Lily Tomlin & Steve Martin in ""All of Me"" made me laugh.  ""Little Miss Sunshine"" made me laugh.  I don't like disparaging humor.  In this film, Sacha Baron Cohen's anti-Jewish sentiment made me squeamish.  Then they started getting sillier like when instructing the artist to remember the horn, ""It must be realistic.""  By then I was laughing.  I wondered if there wasn't intended irony with the actor's last name.  Yes, this humor is very lowbrow.  It makes us ask the existential question, ""Is it really okay to laugh at backward Eastern Europeans?""  But then, this is no more an accurate a representation of them than it is is of Americans.  Could a major export be pubic hair?  It's just comedy.  And I laughed SO hard, I had to sit back in my chair to not faint from laughter.  Unlike Beth Hartford Deroos' review, I did find the 300-pound naked fat man funny, particularly when they started running through the ballroom and wrestling onto the stage.  What absolute silly abandon!  Ken Davitian as Azamat does a great job.  He'll be in the ""Get Smart 08"" movie & has played on TV on ""Six Feet Under,"" ""Gilmore Girls"" & ""E.R.""  Obviously, it wasn't a deep part, but it was very funny.  The DVD extras were hysterical.  Martha Stewart trying to teach Sacha how to make a bed with him getting in it and undressing.  As Martha folds the corners, he asks, ""Where do you chain the womens?"", as if this was a routine part of what happens in an American bed.  The scene in the animal shelter where Cohen wants to adopt a dog so he can ""have sexy time"" and the outrage on the animal shelter operator's face as she shoos him out of the facility is hysterical.  Cohen calling conservative black commentator Alan Keys ""Chocolate face"" is a humor that about only he could bring off.  ""Borat"" won the Best Picture Award of the American Film Institute.  Sacha Baron Cohen won Best Actor Awards from the Golden Globes, San Francisco Film Critics Circle & Utah Film Critics as well as the ""Most Offensive Male Characters"" Award by the Women Film Critics Circle.

Along the way he has all kinds of, you know, wacky adventures. The plotting and overall style is highly reminiscent of too-too stylized 60s and 70s American satires like The President's Analyst, but incidents happen in ""Borat"" that would never be found in its predecessors of three decades earlier.For example, Borat and Azmat, his grossly overweight ""manager"", roll around naked fighting each other in their hotel room, exposing all kinds of flesh to the camera, engaging in positions that make us both cringe and laugh out loud at the same time. There's no question that there's comedy here; the real question is how emotionally resonant this film will be a week from today, or a month from today. Hard to say.Borat sings the national anthem at a rodeo, before which he praises America for its war on Iraq, but during which he exalts Kazakhstan as the greatest nation on earth, also mentioning that all other nations are ruled by little girls. The vociferous cheering that greeted his exhortations against Iraq prior to his rendition of the national anthem are quickly replaced by a cacophony of boos and catcalls.This is really a series of skits and sketches, each of which points up an obvious shortcoming of American culture--and/or of global culture. In his native country, says Borat, his sister is the fourth best hooker in the nation, and he also tells of the annual festival of ""The Running of the Jew""--an obvious takeoff on the running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain. This points not so much to American cultural stupidity but to its global counterpart.Borat is likely worth seeing, but is certainly not a linear film. The message is basically--everybody's stupid.  Fair enough.

I am an ESOL Teacher and find other cultures interesting.  While it is very possible to see Sasha Baron Cohen's characterization of a Kazakhstan immigrant offensive, I think it has a lot more to do with how Americans deal with people from other countries and their beliefs of people who live in them.  Cohen seems determine to get Americans to take a look at their prejudices whether they are out there in plain sight or hidden under the guise of ""tolerance"".  I do have complaints about how hard he leans on gay jokes which I believe he is uncomfortable with, and the naked fight scene goes on far too long and offensively.

1047405,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B000MMMT9G,"Maine Writer ""David""","[1, 3]","There is no question that Sacha Baron Cohen is very, very smart. After all, he has contrived a way to get ordinary people to open their hearts and minds and let all their darkness and bigotry come spilling out. In the end, I think it's way more subtle and sophisticated than it seems. But that's only part of the story. Not all of the ""victims"" of Borat's pranks are unsympathetic. There are some who are well-meaning, altruistic, and sympathetic to this seemingly lovable idiot from an alien land where, he manages to convince them, men drink fermented horse urine and make women ride on the outside of buses. And that's the rub. Cohen is making sport of the good and bad, the innocent and racist, with one fat brush. Through his eyes, the world is populated with sloppy, boorish, ignorant, and sometimes really, really nice fools that smart people can make sport of relentlessly.After all, you'd have to be a complete idiot to believe that there is a country where gays wear blue hats, men brag about their sisters' oral sex skills, Jews are feared as shape-shifting demons, and no one knows how to use a toilet. The sad truth, however, is that a lot of decent, well-meaning and sympathetic types take Borat at face value -- not because of stupidity or idiocy -- but because they're perfect targets for a fraud. And that's exactly what Sacha Baron Cohen really is -- a good old-fashioned fraud. He's the embodiment of reality TV, the rich bachelor who isn't, the bold-faced lie.And, in the end, though I laughed and laughed and felt kind of sick about it afterwards, Cohen a pretty sick and talented schmuck. He's great a making fools of people, and, like the crowd on the school bus that laughed at the clumsy doofus with the banana-shaped head (I think every school bus has one), we laugh along with Cohen at how stupid, pathetic, and flawed people are. Laugh, laugh, laugh.I couldn't help but smile when I learned that, during his promotional blitz in character, a New Yorker who wasn't having any of it began to deliver a nice beating to Mr. Cohen.

1047414,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000MMMT9G,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 3]","Borat, a wild and sometimes almost completely out of control comedy, tells the fictional story of a news reporter named Borat Sagdiyev who travels from Kazakhstan to America to study American life. His government allegedly hopes to ""benefit"" from learning American ways. Of course, all this is merely a premise for a wacky comedy. We see Borat, played by Sacha Baron Cohen, traveling around the United States with his producer Azamat, making fun of them and sometimes driving them crazy with his Borat personality. The people he interviews, including a humor coach, feminists, a rodeo crowd and college students never knew that he was pulling their legs while they were making this film.It's stunning at times how much the Americans, including the humor coach and the people at a society dinner, put up with the rather crude and obnoxious Borat. Borat has many ways of making people less than comfortable and catch them off their guard. For example, he actually walks up to men on the New York City subway and tries to kiss them on the cheek! Ay! Of course, some people paid a high price for being ""subjects"" of the Borat experience; we are all familiar by now of the lawsuits that people filed against Sacha Cohen because they were humiliated by him on camera. They never knew they'd be seen across the world on movie screens. That could be embarrassing!Look also for a strong subplot: Borat sees Pamela Anderson on television and decides to run across the country, ""interviewing"" people, as he travels not just to understand Americans but also to trap Pamela Anderson into marrying him. Watch how this plays out when Borat eventually does meet Pamela!This movie is not for sensitive people who insist on political correctness. Borat Sagdiyev is certainly very much a Jew hater (although in real life Sacha Cohen is very religious Jew); and Borat's views on women, romance, handicapped people and African American people aren't exactly politically correct. In fact, Borat's beliefs are mostly downright racist. The trick, to make the movie work as a comedy, is to take these bigoted views and expose them (and the Americans who become ensnared in Borat's ""little schemes"") in a way that is sure to get a laugh. In essence, Borat tries to be a modern day ""Archie Bunker"" who also makes fun of (and provokes) people by trying to kiss them on the cheek when they have never even seen him before.The DVD comes with a plethora of deleted scenes; and the music ""infomercial"" was also very well done. We also get footage of Borat speaking to crowds, being interviewed on Late Night with Conen O'Brien and more!The cinematography is great in the scenes with Borat and Pamela Anderson; and I liked the scenes back in Kazakhstan when Borat is preparing to go to America.If you can take a joke, you will enjoy Borat. It's not for everyone; it's far from being politically correct but it should be OK once in a while to make fun of ourselves.

In addition to filming a documentary, Borat falls madly in love with Pamela Anderson after watching an old ""Baywatch"" rerun, and he desperately tries to get to California in order to make Pamela his wife so he can have ""the sexy time"" with her.Yes, ""Borat"" can be pretty funny at times. How can you NOT laugh at a man traveling across the country in an ice cream van with a grizzly bear in the rear compartment? However, there are a lot of things in the film that cross the line in terms of poking fun at women, Jews, etc. I probably could have taken all that in stride, though, if not for all the other crude elements of this movie. All the jokes about rape and bestiality were really pushing it, but the nakedness proved to be too much for me, especially the much-talked about nude fight scene between Borat and his travel companion, Azamat (Ken Davitian).

Part of Borat's hilarity is that it matches our hunger for reality-show type interaction with candid camera type events and in doing so, exposes the bigotry of its unwitting cast.The plot is almost beside the point, so I won't go over it in detail here.  Suffice it to say that Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen) is a journalist new to America from Kazakhstan, making a film with his producer Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitian).  They film every experience, from Borat singing a national anthem at a rodeo to Borat hitching a ride with drunk frat boys, Borat running naked in a hotel to Borat attending classes on social etiquette.Contrary to what the many lawsuits that arose from this film, most of the American citizens compose themselves admirably. Sure, there's the occasional bigoted jerk, but said jerks are easy to spot.  If you're shocked about a gun shop owner not blinking when Borat asks for a ""gun to kill a Jew"" then you haven't been to a gun shop.And perhaps that's part of the humor.  Borat visits places we know exist in America but haven't been there ourselves, and it shows the worst and best we have to offer in typical American fashion...by pointing a camera at it.But I don't buy it.One of the key elements of a magician's art is deception.  The magician will tell you he has nothing up his sleeve, but he most certainly does.  People picked from the audience who supposedly don't know the magician are actually trained plants. In short, magicians lie and we believe them because we want to.Similarly, Cohen's crafted a charade that this is all raw footage, and yet there's the omnipresent camera with its boom microphone and glaring lights. It's clear that the subjects, if they aren't in on the joke, are certainly pandering to the camera.  Until we invent floating invisible cameras or simply violate peoples' rights to make good television, this will always be the case.Borat is rude, crude, and hilarious.  But the amount of navel-gazing it created on behalf of the nation due to its supposedly candid look at America is unwarranted.

He decides that he will not only film in New York, but all across the country, ending up in California where he hopes to meet the ""virginal"" Pamela Anderson.  Along the way, he learns how to drive, adopts a bear, gets humor lessons, sings at a rodeo, and wrestle with Azamat.This is easily the funniest movie I have seen this year.  Sacha Baron Cohen has created an idiot character that exposes the prejudices of the unsuspecting people he interacts with.  Most of what he says is cringeworthy, as he has the ability to say the exact wrong thing to the various people he runs into.

As far as being shocking, i was not personally offended or shocked.  Basically in movies you can have peoples' heads blown off and bodies torn to pieces and still get a Pg-13 rating, but if you say the F word or show a breast it gets an R rating.As far as the really negative reviews it seems as if people are madd at the movie and wrote reviews with a thesaurus and dictionary on hand to incorporate every large word into their review.  I think the movie was actually smart and the show smarter basically it makes fun of the close minded, judgemental, conservative, and uptight people in our society, by making them look bad by using a ridiculous character to bring out their ugly side.  In a way it's theraputic to see these people that judge everyone to be mocked i mean these are the everyday people not putting on blinkers in traffic, talking on the cell phones while driving and driving bad, people that work a register and dont say thank you or welcome, that push their views on other people, people that basically are oblivious to their surroundings but are able to annoy everyone else, where maybe sometimes ignorance is bliss but in the show and in this movie we get to laugh at them instead of honking our horns at them.Anyway all and all the movie is fun, and it's clever however if you haven't bought anything yet try the complete series.Thanks for reading.",4,Movie is good the show is better.

Moore,"[4, 5]","After seeing ""Borat,"" I would have to say that Sacha Baron Cohen is one of the most brilliant and audacious comedians I've ever seen--a four-way cross between Peter Sellers, Andy Kaufman, Johnny Knoxville, and Rabelais. But I also have no desire, at least right now, to ever see this film again. As with some of Richard Pryor's concert films, ""Borat"" makes us laugh partly in pleasure, partly in shock, and partly in embarrassed recognition of the foibles of humankind, of which the entire audience, of course, are members. But whereas Pryor merely gave his observations of America as he saw it, Baron Cohen travels the U.S. disguised as Borat to record the less-than-enlightened opinions of the various Americans he meets. In the cases of elected officials, fundamentalist ministers and other self-styled official spokesmen for American culture, he hoists them fairly by their own petards (the homophobic rodeo manager is the best case in point). I was less comfortable, however, with his forays on the private citizens who were only trying to be nice to a foreigner, and who would have remained anonymous forever if it weren't for Baron Cohen/Borat. Even Borat's biggest fans have to admit he's an agent provocateur of grotesque proportions. Was it really necessary to regale formal dinner guests in Atlanta with bags of (putatively) his own feces? And while I don't really like being in the position of defending drunken frat boys, those particular drunken frat boys were trying to be kind to Borat, and all non-habitual drunks tend to say and do things in private that would never translate to their behavior when sober and in the outside world. There are parts of ""Borat"" that I consider as hilarious as anything ever put on film: I never thought anyone would beat Mel Brooks' evisceration of anti-Semitism in the ""Springtime for Hitler"" sequence of ""The Producers,"" but darned if Baron Cohen doesn't do it with ""The Running of the Jew."" However, too much of the film in my opinion amounts to sabotage on innocent private citizens. My guess is that I would have made like the one New Yorker Borat approached, and run away from him.

Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen) is a fictional television journalist from the backwoods of Kazakhstan who, along with his producer Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitian), comes to the United States to learn from American culture and document his adventures. The pair arrive in New York City, where Borat finds the populace not quite friendly enough for him. An evening spent watching television in his hotel room introduces Borat to ""Baywatch"", and he falls instantly in love with Pamela Anderson. Determined to make Ms. Anderson his wife, Borat and Azamat set out for California in a de-commissioned ice cream truck, trying to make the most of their contacts with American culture along the way.Sacha Baron Cohen has guts. He let Borat's unenlightened views of women, gays, and Jews lose on unsuspecting Americans and barely got out of a rodeo in Salem, Virginia in one piece. Other reactions to Borat were subdued, however, probably because people knew they were being filmed. Only four characters in the movie are portrayed by actors: Borat, Azamat, the prostitute Luenell, and Pamela Anderson. But this isn't Candid Camera. The humor coach, feminists, etiquette expert, dinner guests, B&B; proprietors, antiques dealer, and others believed that they were being filmed for a documentary. That explains why the pranks feel staged and the reactions are feeble. If the intention was to show that Americans are insular and intolerant, it doesn't come off. Only the Chi Psi frat boys are truly vile, and they were drunk.""Borat"" has some very funny scenes, but it is funny only sporadically. The material is more suited to comedic bits than to a feature film. Scenes run on too long, and Borat and Azamat's ambling about the country is tedious. The jokes are funny once, but Borat essentially plays the same prank over and over. There isn't enough material for 1 hour and 25 minutes of movie. The promotional stunts for the film are funnier than the film itself, because they are shorter. As for its controversial (and counterfeit) opinions, ""Borat"" is far too silly to be offensive. And it's too monotonous to be funny. I was sorry to find that ""Borat"" is a yawn.The DVD (20th Century Fox 2007): Bonus features include 8 deleted scenes (""Censored Footage""), ""Global Propaganda"" (16 min), which is footage from the promotional tour for the film, including Sacha Baron Cohen's appearances as Borat on Late Night with Conan O'Brien and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and guest Martha Stewart, and ""Musicks Infomercial"" (1 min), a pseudo-promo for Borat's music.

Cohen's antics as clueless and helplessly hateful Kazack reporter filming a documentary about America and searching to wed Pamela Anderson provide different Americans with an assumededly safe launching point to talk freely about their own prejudices.  Cohen also gets in a naked man-fight, rides around with a protective bear, makes out with his sister and pokes fun at the mentally challenged and the Jews, but that is all beside the point.  Cohen's real mission is to make America stare into it's own still prejudiced heart.  A rodeo cowboy in Georgia generalizes all Muslims as terrorists and admits he would want to see every single homosexual hanged, and the rodeo crowd cheers when Cohen says that George Bush should drink the blood of every man woman and child in Iraq.  A bunch of drunk frat boys casually admit slaves in America would be a good thing and that women are dumb, weak and should be subserviant to men, to say nothing of their attitudes toward the Jews.  These exchanges are funny, but in an almost frightening way.  America should have exorcised these flaws long ago, but they still stick around, waiting to rear their ugly head, if they are given the right catalyst of course.  Cohen's strategy does not always work, as some scenes (the dinner in a southern mansion, humor lessons with an Amerian instructor) sacrifice the social satire for more routine laughs about cultural divide.  But when the commentary kicks in, the implications for American society, now and in the future, are hard to ignore.",4,"""Borat"" Has More on His Mind Than Comedy",1164326400,"11 24, 2006",2006,1744,"['Borat', 'twisted', 'comedic', 'gem', 'brilliant', 'alert', 'mind', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'one', 'thing', 'mind', 'exposing', 'ugly', 'bigotry', 'still', 'festering', 'just', 'beneath', 'America', 'seemingly', 'welcoming', 'cosmopolitan', 'society', 'Cohen', 'antics', 'clueless', 'helplessly', 'hateful', 'Kazack', 'reporter', 'filming', 'documentary', 'America', 'searching', 'wed', 'Pamela', 'Anderson', 'provide', 'different', 'Americans', 'assumededly', 'safe', 'launching', 'point', 'talk', 'freely', 'own', 'prejudices', 'Cohen', 'also', 'naked', 'man-fight', 'protective', 'bear', 'out', 'sister', 'pokes', 'fun', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'Jews', 'point', 'Cohen', 'real', 'mission', 'make', 'America', 'stare', 'own', 'still', 'prejudiced', 'heart', 'rodeo', 'cowboy', 'Georgia', 'generalizes', 'Muslims', 'terrorists', 'admits', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'single', 'homosexual', 'hanged', 'rodeo', 'crowd', 'cheers', 'when', 'Cohen', 'George', 'Bush', 'should', 'drink', 'blood', 'man', 'woman', 'child', 'Iraq', 'A', 'bunch', 'drunk', 'frat', 'casually', 'admit', 'slaves', 'America', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'women', 'are', 'dumb', 'weak', 'should', 'be', 'subserviant', 'men', 'say', 'nothing', 'attitudes', 'Jews', 'exchanges', 'are', 'funny', 'almost', 'frightening', 'way', 'America', 'should', 'have', 'exorcised', 'flaws', 'long', 'ago', 'still', 'stick', 'around', 'waiting', 'rear', 'ugly', 'head', 'are', 'given', 'right', 'catalyst', 'course', 'Cohen', 'strategy', 'not', 'always', 'work', 'scenes', 'dinner', 'southern', 'mansion', 'humor', 'lessons', 'Amerian', 'instructor', 'social', 'satire', 'more', 'routine', 'laughs', 'cultural', 'divide', 'when', 'commentary', 'kicks', 'implications', 'American', 'society', 'now', 'future', 'are', 'hard', 'ignore']",N/A

In one of the first scenes, when Borat says ""I like sex. It is nice."", you get a pretty good prelude to what is to follow.This is politically incorrect, tasteless, offensive and crass humour, to put it mildly. However, despite myself, I had to admit that Borat was pretty cool guy and that Cohen is a much braver man than I. Offending everyone from driving instructors, rodeo managers and audiences, passengers on trains, people in the street and etiquette coaches, ""Borat"" really is ""in-your-face"" humour.The basic premise of the movie is Borat's journey to the ""US and A"" to find out about that great country so as to improve his native Kazakhstan. Along the way, he falls in love and travels across the entire country to find the woman of his dreams. I still wonder that he didn't get pounded into a pulp by the security.Despite all the rudeness, I was very surprised that there was a bit of a sensitive side to the movie as well, between Borat and Luenell. It was a nice little message, if somewhat cliched and corny.In short, this movie is not for everyone. If sexual references and nudity are not your thing, I would avoid this one like the bubonic plague. Would I see it again? No. However, I am glad that I have seen it.

Filled with the most politically incorrect topics one could find.  Incredible!All shot as a faux documentary, Borat is supposed to be the 4th most famous person in all of Kazakhstan, coming to the US and A to learn how to improve his country's cultural learnings.  After falling in love with CJ on Baywatch, Borat convinces his producer companion to leave NYC in search of California (and Pamela Anderson) so that they might cross the US and A and find real culture. Armed with his vial of gypsy tears to ward off evil, a wild bear, and a dilapidated ice cream truck, the two companions from Kazakhstan head west.  What ensues is comedic blasphemy to the point of needing an oxygen bottle to maintain consciousness; because you will laugh yourself into asphyxia.Shot for real cheap.  The producers of this film scored a hit and scored hard.  As for the controversy and all that.  I'll say this: No one is holding a gun to your head to watch this!!  Right?  Gawd!  People are so f*cking uptight nowadays!  Get a clue.  This is the most tongue-in-cheek movie ever made!  There are no boundries.  And the most hysterical thing is that most of the people in this movie (supposedly) had no idea that it wasn't real.  That is the sheer genius of Borat.  They took real people, put them into uncomfortable situations, and watched the results.  Most people aren't very nice when they're nudged in the wrong direction and Borat proves that.  If people can't take a joke, f*ck them!  There are far too many other attrocities going on in the world to be wasting time protesting a movie.Borat is obviously not going to be for everyone, but if you want to laugh yourself hoarse and you have a somewhat open-minded sense of humor, buy it right now.

But when I went and saw BORAT in the theater, I emerged with an emphatic ""Hell yes"" on my mind, in response to the BORAT tv spots, where critics asked, ""Has this man made the funniest movie of the year?""Borat, I had managed to learn before seeing the movie-film, is not a real person, but to call him a fictional character is also inaccurate. Borat Sagdiyev is more like Cohen hilarious alter-ego, a sexist, racist, homophobic, xenophobic, Anti-Semite who makes his way across the U.S.and A with portly producer Azamt to make a documentary on American culture for make benefit glorious nation of Kazakhstan. The two find themselves in situations (some staged, some real) that range from hilarious (Borat and Azamat's stay at a bed and breakfast run by a Jewish couple) to expository (Borat being told why he should shave his mustache) to disturbing (Borat being reccommended to drive 35 to 40 miles an hour ""to guarantee I kill the Gypsy."") to downright disgusting (Borat and Azamat's wrestling match, both in their birthday suits.) Along the way, Borat is, of course, sidetracked by his desire to go to California and make sexy-time with Pamela Anderson, and Azamat insists the drive ""in case the Jews repeat their attack of 9/11.""Much has been made of Borat's litany a hatred's in the film, most notably his Anti-Semitism (I would actually classify it more as Semite-phobia, since Borat seems to expect all Jews to have horns.) Sacha Baron Cohen is himself Jewish, and has said he uses his character's ignorance and hatred to expose the real haters lurking amongst us. It is a fantastic strategy, and he exposes alot more people than you would expect. A deleted scene on the DVD shows that at least one person was able to pass the test, however. Borat goes to a dog pound to seek protection from the Jew, but the owner will not allow him to buy a dog for this purpose, citing that ""Jews are Jesus' children.""BORAT is the kind of movie that everyone expects to generate a sequel.

1047437,AIFCR0AGQAOL3,B000MMMT9G,Mrs. Woogie,"[17, 25]","Sacha Baron Cohen is the most fearless comedic presence I've ever seen.  I don't believe there is anything he would not do, and he pulls off some of the most offensive antics by adding such naivite, he's almost endearing as he is shocking.  This is not for the faint of heart, mind you.  Satire is not meant to be warm and fuzzy or easily swallowed; those who cannot wrap their minds around this idea need to stick with The Santa Clause 3 or some other such inane, mindless comedy.  If you enjoy People Magazine and Bill O'Reilly, you'll want to skip this one.  However, if you like Jon Stewart's Daily Show and The Onion, this will be right up your alley.Another word on the ""offensive, anti-Semetic"" nature of this movie.  Mr. Cohen is JEWISH and the majority of his ""Kazakhstani"" dialogue is Hebrew (along with some Polish).  His humor is meant to expose the anti-Semitisim in the world, the jingoistic manuvering world-wide that is isolating nations, how blindly people will follow the party line and perpetuate stereotypes by failing to have independent thought.  This is no different than Dave Chappelle or Chris Rock slamming black culture or Carlos Mencia thrashing Hispanics -- when you insult your own culture, it's usually to expose both racism by others and the self-sabotage that perpetuates such garbage.  People ask, ""Why aren't there more black jokes by Borat?""  Easy -- because that would be offensive and beyond the point of the whole exercise.  Notice that very little has been said by the Anti-Defamation League or other Jewish cultural groups.  They understand the point of this movie; why should we be so quick to ""save"" them, as if they weren't capable of analyzing this on their own.  That in itself is offensive, in my eyes.So, is you're looking for a great diversion that is unlike any movie you've ever seen, this is your kind of movie.

While toilet humor may appeal to a certain mentality, my opinion is that this film would be better served by being placed in the toilet.Believe me when I say that I am not easily offended, nor am I given to prudish attitudes regarding subject matter that is risque or offensive to some in polite society. This movie, however, goes far beyond the pale.It was neither satisfying or pleasant to see two naked men, one of whom was outrageously rotund, wrestling around together on a bed. This homoerotic bit of comedic misadventure burst from the privacy of their hotel room into an elevator, through corridors of the hotel, and ultimately intruding on a meeting of some sort in the hotel ballroom.Not only does this movie suck, it nearly shows you the act!While I am not Christian, I was disturbed by the fun being made of Christianity.While I am not a Jew, I was offended at the ""running of the Jew"".While I am not a rodeo fan, I was offended at the insulting behavior directed toward those who are.While I am not a cowboy, I thought the film made fun of those who live that life in America.I am, however, a patriotic American. I was offended at our national athem being corrupted for totally purile comedic purpose. I certainly did not find it funny in any manner whatsoever. I also did not find funny the sight of our flag being pitched to the ground. This is an outrage, especially when our young men and women are dying daily in Iraq under that same flag.A word to Sacha Baron Cohen: If you want to make fun of a nation, go make fun of your own! Instead of hurling insulting humor at George W. Bush, why not take on Tony Blair!The major premise of the film seems to be how many ways they can sneak male genitalia into the picture without getting an ""X"" rating. Photos of a penis are gleefully shown with gay abandon! No pun intended. The other overwhelming theme seems to revolve around excrement. From being presented with the spectacle of Cohen relieving himself in the bushes at Trump Towers, to his bringing a bag of his own fecal material down to a dinner party, to the van in which they housed a bear, they seem almost ritually obsessed with feces. And crap is what this movie is.This movie is the most tasteless, disgusting and banal piece of tripe to come along in many years, and whatever actual humor may be found in the film is lost among the incessant sex and toilet jokes, tastelessly woven through a fabric of intolerance masquerading as humor.This movie is the cinematic equivalent of Michael Richards ignorant and racist attack on blacks. Except in this case, Cohen does not stop at the implied ""N"" word, but enhances his act with the ""J"" word, the ""S"" word, the ""Q"" word and a host of others.That this film won awards only serves to illustrate how quickly our world is devolving an ultimate IDIOCRACY!

By looking at its ratings on IMDB.com and other websites, it was supposed to be one of the funniest movies of 2006.  I was wholly disappointed.  As a minority, and someone who appreciates good racial and ethnic jokes, I found this movie's comedy to be a haphazard mix of derogatory, old-hat or just plain disgusting.  Much of the humor featured in this film has been included in older movies.  For example, the notion of Borat going from his backwards, ignorant, rural village in Kazakhstan to the wonders and cosmopolitanism of New York City is a storyline with too much play already.  The Beverly Hillbillies mastered this situational backdrop decades ago without the overt illusions to incest and personal violence made in this movie.  As another example, when Borat first enters his hotel room in NYC, he unknowingly refreshes himself with water from the toilet bowl.  A similar scene was used 20 years ago in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventures in regards to the Mongol warrior.  The underwear scenes were also quite old as similar tricks have been used in old SNL skits and the movie Zoolander.  Even the bungled singing of the National Anthem by Borat seems to reminisce Roseanna Barr's blasphemy in front of a MLB game in the early 1990s.There were occasional, original funny scenes, such as the bear Borat adopts to defend themselves.  But these few scenes were drowned out by the quantity of jokes in poor humor.

I easily named Bruno and struggled to name the obvious, Ali G, and I got my free tickets.Let me begin by saying that I ""get"" this film. Cohen's anthropological project is not lost on me. I understand that Borat is a deconstructive mirror of American culture, but I do not understand how this is a new and funny idea. It's been done before in everything from Henry James' novel The American to Eddie Murphy's film ""Coming to America.""But I could forgive the unoriginality of the film if it could make me laugh. Sadly, the laughs were few. I spent most of my time wondering how the film was produced. It would have been better if there wasn't an attempt at an enduring plot, but rather an episodic plotting of American ignorance. And where the film could have delivered funny commentary (say, a consistent kind of reporting back to Kazakhstan about how Americans do this or that), it instead went for Jackass-style embarrassment of real people. Since this kind of ""humor"" clogs all contemporary media, I feel desensitized and therefore disinterested in it.But really, I shouldn't be reviewing this film. I'm not of the intended audience. It was made for those who had a political awakening at a younger age than me. What seems boring and immature to me might actually tickle the funny bone of my younger siblings and my students. That's what getting old does to you. It separates you from the younger generation. The decision is to either embrace or reject this inevitability.Perhaps some people will think I'm ""looking too deeply"" into this movie and expecting too much of it. If that's true, let's not pretend that this is the greatest comedy ever.In the end, I didn't get much out of this film. What I did learn is that I have finally started getting old.

Compound this lack of sophistication and brilliance with, among other things, overexposure in the media, and the film lost its punch early on for me. I have just read too much about it. So here I am, adding to the clutter.Truth is, it is a film that would make you laugh. ""The Problem With Mary"" made me laugh also, and it's on a low brow par with that. Inspite of his education, Cohen, whose other artistic highlight is BBC's Ali G, is more Benny Schill than anything resembling Cleese, Chapman, Moore or Sellars. The schtick you know: Dim Eurasian Muslim visits America and interviews dim Americans. All sorts of groups have taken issue with the pillory he runs their interests through, but if you are taking this anywhere near seriously, get a grip. It's dumb comedy, possibly satircal, but essentially easy laughs for the mentally challenged. Nothing wrong with that on the surface. But as Chapman might intone, I find this all too silly, now get on with real comedy. No one enjoys a good joke more than me. Well, except maybe my wife. And her sister......Cohen takes his cues more from Howard Stern and Artie Lang ( a vastly inferior departure from Howard's collaboration with Martling), than Walt Whitman and Jack Kerouac, who were the philosophical underpinning to Andrei Codreisciu's brilliant ROAD SCHOLAR,  which takes a similar pilgrimage: an Eastern European Jew sets out to discover what it means to be an American. The journey is often very funny, very touching, often brilliantly incisive in depicting how the core of America is its ability to assimilate many different groups with just as many beliefs and social customs in an integrated stew, one not always smooth, and sometimes not very integrated, but encompassing none the less. And to that end, Codreisciu celebrates his own amazement and the diversity itself that he encounters with a sense of grace and self-deprecating humour. Cohen is all sex, fart and jew jokes. Oh well. Flatulence is its own reward.I suspect the Cohen film would have found its audience even if the government of Kazahkstan hadn't objected to its depiction of its country as a jew-bashing sexist nation. I'd like to think that even in red state America, there might be some recognition that Kazahkstan might have more to it. Scratch the surface and it's clear it is a self-sustaining democracy in the former Soviet enclave with enormous oil reserves. The rub for Cohen might be that it is a Muslim country to boot. For all the hoo-hah about the egg scene, I would suggest to you that what's on offer here is not the literal show before you, and that's what Kazahstan objected to. If the film is anti-semitic, it is so toward the ""other Semites"", to borrow a slogan from the pork industry. Not very Kosher, that. My guess is that, a bit the inverse of Mel Gibson, Cohen has some bigotry issues with successful Muslims. Might be fun to lock him in the same cell as Mel.Anyway, you won't go blind watching this. Problem remains that there's been too much written about it, and that's not the film's fault.",2,"BORAT IS NO ""ROAD SCHOLAR""",1163635200,"11 16, 2006",2006,3132,"['Let', 'be', 'honest', 'here', 'Cohen', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'even', 'Andy', 'Kauffman', 'Compound', 'lack', 'sophistication', 'brilliance', 'other', 'things', 'overexposure', 'media', 'film', 'lost', 'punch', 'early', 'have', 'just', 'read', 'too', 'much', 'here', 'am', 'adding', 'clutter.Truth', 'film', 'would', 'make', 'laugh', 'Problem', 'Mary', 'made', 'also', 'low', 'brow', 'par', 'Inspite', 'education', 'Cohen', 'other', 'artistic', 'highlight', 'BBC', 'Ali', 'G', 'more', 'Benny', 'Schill', 'anything', 'resembling', 'Cleese', 'Chapman', 'Moore', 'Sellars', 'schtick', 'know', 'Dim', 'Eurasian', 'Muslim', 'visits', 'America', 'interviews', 'dim', 'Americans', 'sorts', 'groups', 'have', 'taken', 'issue', 'pillory', 'interests', 'are', 'taking', 'anywhere', 'seriously', 'get', 'grip', 'dumb', 'comedy', 'possibly', 'satircal', 'essentially', 'easy', 'laughs', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'Nothing', 'wrong', 'surface', 'Chapman', 'might', 'intone', 'find', 'too', 'silly', 'now', 'get', 'real', 'comedy', 'one', 'good', 'joke', 'more', 'Well', 'maybe', 'wife', 'sister', 'Cohen', 'cues', 'more', 'Howard', 'Stern', 'Artie', 'Lang', 'vastly', 'inferior', 'departure', 'Howard', 'collaboration', 'Martling', 'Walt', 'Whitman', 'Jack', 'Kerouac', 'who', 'were', 'philosophical', 'underpinning', 'Andrei', 'Codreisciu', 'brilliant', 'ROAD', 'SCHOLAR', 'similar', 'pilgrimage', 'Eastern', 'European', 'Jew', 'out', 'discover', 'what', 'be', 'American', 'journey', 'often', 'very', 'funny', 'very', 'touching', 'often', 'brilliantly', 'incisive', 'depicting', 'how', 'core', 'America', 'ability', 'assimilate', 'many', 'different', 'groups', 'just', 'many', 'beliefs', 'social', 'customs', 'integrated', 'stew', 'one', 'not', 'always', 'smooth', 'sometimes', 'not', 'very', 'integrated', 'encompassing', 'none', 'less', 'end', 'Codreisciu', 'own', 'amazement', 'diversity', 'sense', 'grace', 'self-deprecating', 'humour', 'Cohen', 'sex', 'fart', 'jew', 'jokes', 'Oh', 'well', 'Flatulence', 'own', 'reward.I', 'suspect', 'Cohen', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'audience', 'even', 'government', 'Kazahkstan', 'had', ""n't"", 'objected', 'depiction', 'country', 'jew-bashing', 'sexist', 'nation', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', 'even', 'red', 'state', 'America', 'might', 'be', 'recognition', 'Kazahkstan', 'might', 'have', 'more', 'Scratch', 'surface', 'clear', 'self-sustaining', 'democracy', 'former', 'Soviet', 'enclave', 'enormous', 'oil', 'reserves', 'rub', 'Cohen', 'might', 'be', 'Muslim', 'country', 'boot', 'hoo-hah', 'egg', 'scene', 'would', 'suggest', 'what', 'offer', 'here', 'not', 'literal', 'show', 'what', 'Kazahstan', 'objected', 'film', 'anti-semitic', 'so', 'other', 'Semites', 'borrow', 'slogan', 'pork', 'industry', 'Not', 'very', 'Kosher', 'guess', 'bit', 'inverse', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Cohen', 'bigotry', 'issues', 'successful', 'Muslims', 'Might', 'be', 'fun', 'lock', 'same', 'cell', 'Mel.Anyway', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'blind', 'watching', 'Problem', 'been', 'too', 'much', 'written', 'not', 'film', 'fault']",N/A

I would never have believed it was possible in a million years. I was never a huge fan of his TV show or particularly, Ali G, one of his many zany characters. For various reasons, I decided not to go see it when it was out in the cinemas and really wasn't going to check it out at all but there's been such a furore, in the end, I just had to get the DVD to see what all the fuss was about.I guess I can see it now. One minute jaw-droppingly awful, the next minute so hysterically funny I had to keep pausing the DVD to wipe the tears from my eyes, Cohen has taken a huge risk, touched a cultural nerve and struck gold. (Over $230 million worldwide, to be exact).He makes complete fools out of a lot of people (including the po-faced, the uninformed and those too kind to say anything for fear of seeming disrespectful to this apparent innocent from the developing world), without them actually realising he's doing it and while I accept that he doesn't seem to care who he offends, in my opinion, anyone who take offence to anything in this particular movie has missed the point of it altogether.

Well, I certainly did.  I mean, it's not every day I see a bear's head on a plate in a fridge.  Oh, and wait for the prosthetic scene.One thing that struck me is how intolerant New Yorkers were of his antics (""Kiss me and I'll kick you in the nuts!"" was a typical reaction), and how tolerant the rest of the country was (e.g., the bouffy Southern belle patiently explaining to him how to use a flush toilet, and toilet paper - after he'd shown up at the dinner table with a bag of his own excrement).  An interesting juxtaposition: the Blue state has no time for a clueless foreigner, while the Red states will even put up with an incredibly evil take on the national anthem (Look out for the flag-carrying horse falling over on its side.

I just chiefly wanted to convey that this is the most hilarious, side-splitting film I've ever seen in my half-Century (+) on the planet.THE STORY: Borat is a television commentator in Kazakhstan and he comes to America with his producer on a shoestring budget to document life here. He starts out in New York City but he quickly decides to head for California where his true Hollywood love is involved in the television industry (Baywatch). He encounters BIG TROUBLE (based upon his crude cultural background) everywhere he goes. It's that simple.My brother and I watched this movie yesterday and both of us laughed so hard from beginning to end that we had to watch the movie a second time to hear all the stuff we failed to attend during the first round from laughing too loudly. Neither of us is a contemporary film fan (both of us are retired cops) but we avow to make a big exception here. We had tears in our eyes and could barely catch our breath -- it's that funny.Is this 2006 film for everyone? Well no, the kiddies will have to be nudged out of the room (and out of earshot as well) and I assume that there are women, minorities, devout Christians, and other folks who are particularly sensitive to ethnic remarks and incendiary language who will abhor this one. I'd say that most people will come down on this movie firmly on one side or the other, with few on the fence.So, there's some pretty provocative nudity and the language is akin to what you might expect to hear from an angry and drunken Portuguese Stevedore. Heck, the antics themselves are pretty provocative. But in the end, if you don't care about all that stuff, it's just a movie, folks -- if you think that this presentation would offend you, just don't watch it.All others RUN... don't walk, RUN to the video store and rent or buy this crazy film!

There are elements of ""Borat"" that I was uncomfortable with; but, to the extent it makes some people look bad (for instance, the cowboy who denigrated Arab people), they were simply having their bigotry exposed.  At other times, Sacha Cohen is using his own Borat character to mock a variety of regressive attitudes.This film not only brought out some ugly attitudes of Americans, but also showed some of our kindness - such as the patience that many people showed toward Borat and his antics.And while some reviewers were disgusted by the naked battle Borat had with his producer, by the time that struggle entered the meeting of business professionals, I had tears in my eyes.It was revealing to see the contrast in treatment Borat received in New York City when he tried to greet people with a kiss on the cheek (threats of violence and fear), versus the love he received at the Gay Pride Parade in D.C.There are ways in which this film undercuts the carefully crafted image of ""brand America"" that many people here and abroad have uncritically accepted.

Partially scripted with professional actors and partially filmed guerilla-style with regular people, it stars Sacha Baron Cohen and Ken Davitian.A buddy film that documents a cross-country odyssey from New York to Los Angeles, the story veers off the road, when Borat finds a photo of ""Pah-may-la"" Anderson at a yard sale and decides to make the Baywatch star his bride.Critically acclaimed and wildly popular at the box office, BORAT will nonetheless never be made into a sequel, thanks to the hundreds - if not thousands of lawsuits - it inspired.  Still it is definitely worth seeing if not for the humor then for the revealing sociological window it offers into American culture.Like a fun house mirror that exaggerates anything that stands before it, the Borat character succeeds in provoking and poking fun at both the stereotypically nave American characters who appear in the film and those who watch and review it.Whatever the unfortunate personality quirk is, Borat, like a caricature artist, is a genius at uncovering and magnifying it - which is undoubtedly why this is the film that launched a thousand lawsuits.  From the misogynistic, anti-Semitic frat boys and the homophobic rodeo director to the perfectly polite Southern socialites who eventually call the police to have Borat removed from their dinner party, no one is safe from ridicule - not even the film's reviewers, many of whom use the occasion to indulge in middle-American bashing.Before I saw the film I could easily understand why politicians in Kazakhstan would be upset by a movie that misrepresents and makes fun of their nation.  But after seeing it, I realize that BORAT plays the same fun house prank on Kazakhstan that it pulls on the US, by provoking this huge Eurasian country to ban the film from ever showing there.In the spirit of ""I had to kill him because he falsely called me a murderer,"" BORAT inspires America's self-flagellating, intolerance of intolerance and Kazakhstan's ban on the film in protest of being portrayed as a dictatorship where people have few if any natural rights.One last thought: if I were one of the horrendous frat boys who appeared in this movie, I'd be too busy getting appearance-altering plastic surgery or a personality transplant to bother suing the filmmakers.-- Regina McMenamin",5,A Fun House Reflection on American Culture,1173571200,"03 11, 2007",2007,2510,"['Recommended', 'who', 'enjoy', 'irreverent', 'humor', 'BORAT', 'story', 'two', 'journalists', 'fictionalized', 'nation', 'Kazakhstan', 'who', 'travel', 'US', 'film', 'documentary', 'life', 'States', 'Partially', 'scripted', 'professional', 'actors', 'partially', 'filmed', 'guerilla-style', 'regular', 'people', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'Ken', 'Davitian.A', 'buddy', 'film', 'documents', 'cross-country', 'odyssey', 'New', 'York', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'story', 'veers', 'road', 'when', 'Borat', 'photo', 'Pah-may-la', 'Anderson', 'yard', 'sale', 'make', 'Baywatch', 'star', 'bride.Critically', 'acclaimed', 'wildly', 'popular', 'box', 'office', 'BORAT', 'will', 'nonetheless', 'never', 'be', 'made', 'sequel', 'thanks', 'hundreds', 'not', 'thousands', 'lawsuits', 'inspired', 'Still', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'not', 'humor', 'then', 'revealing', 'sociological', 'window', 'American', 'culture.Like', 'fun', 'house', 'mirror', 'anything', 'Borat', 'character', 'provoking', 'poking', 'fun', 'stereotypically', 'nave', 'American', 'characters', 'who', 'appear', 'film', 'who', 'watch', 'review', 'it.Whatever', 'unfortunate', 'personality', 'quirk', 'Borat', 'caricature', 'artist', 'genius', 'uncovering', 'magnifying', 'undoubtedly', 'why', 'film', 'launched', 'thousand', 'lawsuits', 'misogynistic', 'anti-Semitic', 'frat', 'boys', 'homophobic', 'rodeo', 'director', 'perfectly', 'polite', 'Southern', 'socialites', 'who', 'eventually', 'call', 'police', 'have', 'Borat', 'removed', 'dinner', 'party', 'one', 'safe', 'ridicule', 'not', 'even', 'film', 'reviewers', 'many', 'whom', 'use', 'occasion', 'indulge', 'middle-American', 'bashing.Before', 'saw', 'film', 'could', 'easily', 'understand', 'why', 'politicians', 'Kazakhstan', 'would', 'be', 'upset', 'movie', 'misrepresents', 'fun', 'nation', 'seeing', 'realize', 'BORAT', 'same', 'fun', 'house', 'prank', 'Kazakhstan', 'US', 'provoking', 'huge', 'Eurasian', 'country', 'ban', 'film', 'ever', 'showing', 'spirit', 'had', 'kill', 'falsely', 'called', 'murderer', 'BORAT', 'America', 'self-flagellating', 'intolerance', 'intolerance', 'Kazakhstan', 'ban', 'film', 'protest', 'being', 'portrayed', 'dictatorship', 'where', 'people', 'have', 'few', 'natural', 'rights.One', 'last', 'thought', 'were', 'one', 'horrendous', 'frat', 'boys', 'who', 'appeared', 'movie', ""'d"", 'be', 'too', 'busy', 'getting', 'appearance-altering', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'personality', 'transplant', 'bother', 'suing', 'filmmakers.', 'Regina', 'McMenamin']",N/A

1047472,A1XESQ7C7NNZX4,B000MMMT9G,Reviewer,"[15, 48]","The main premise of the Borat spoof-documentary is fighting antisemitism by presenting it as irrational. For his film Cohen chose a whole ""antisemite country"" - Kazakhstan. It is an unfortunate choice because the Asian nation of 15 million just regained democracy and just began to breath freely after over 70 years of Soviet communist oppression, but it was a safe pick by Cohen because there is no Kazakh minority lobby in the Western world that would effectively protest the defamation.Cohen used all his talent in the movie to present an antisemite (Borat) as someone who comes from a poor and backward country, drinks horse urine, hates all women (Cohen skillfully and heavily piggybacks his agenda on whacky anti-feminism), hurts animals, involves in incest and so on, Borat will help the Western ""intellectual"" get the exact picture.On September 28, 2006 the Anti Defamation League (ADL) made the following statement about Borat,""When approaching this film, one has to understand that there is absolutely no intent on the part of the filmmakers to offend, and no malevolence on the part of Sacha Baron Cohen, who is himself proudly Jewish.  We hope that everyone who chooses to see the film understands Mr. Cohen's comedic technique, which is to use humor to unmask the absurd and irrational side of anti-Semitism and other phobias born of ignorance and fear. We are concerned, however, that one serious pitfall is that the audience may not always be sophisticated enough to get the joke, and that some may even find it reinforcing their bigotry. While Mr. Cohen's brand of humor may be tasteless and even offensive to some, we understand that the intent is to dash stereotypes, not to perpetuate them.""So, to get the message from Borat right, one needs to be ""sophisticated enough"" but probably not too sophisticated. And, of course, if a Kazakh comedian made the same film only pretending to be a Jewish journalist, the ADL's and US media reaction to it would have been precisely the same.I'm giving Borat one star for stereotyping Kazakhstan and for ethnically offensive incest jokes.

Nonetheless, I gave it an honest effort, even sitting through the whole thing. While the theater had a lot of people, it struck me that the laughs, and there were some, to be sure, just didn't come often enough for people to feel like they were truly having a good time. I know that at a certain point I waited for it to be over. When it ended I felt like my friends felt the same.

The DVD has lots of extra scenes that were cut, and will be as offensive as the film itself. I really enjoyed it a lot. The only way I could  see a sequel is if Borat took a northern route and met the mid-westerners like myself. We have foibles of our own, and the southerners have been picked on enough.

Popular TV journalist Borat Sagdiyev (Cohen) travels from his simple home in Kazakhstan to the United States to record a documentary about American customs to bring back to his beloved home. With his able producer Azamat Bagatov, Borat interacts with Americans and heads to California to seduce ""Baywatch"" star Pamela Anderson. ""Borat"" is an outrageously humorous mockumentary that showcases Cohen's fearless comedic talents. Most scenes in the movie are unscripted with real Americans. ""Borat"" isn't for everyone. Due to its prejudiced remarks, the mockumentary generated much controversy and was banned in several countries. In the United States, ""Borat"" received strong positive reviews by critics, became a commercial success and received numerous awards.If you enjoyed ""Borat"" in theaters then pick up your copy of critically acclaimed mockumentary on DVD. The mockumentary is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format. Due to the various types of cameras used in the film, the picture quality is somewhat mixed but still pretty sharp. The 5.1 Dolby Digital sound isn't terrific but still clean and well-balanced.

1047482,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000MMMT9G,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 4]","The pseudo-documentary ""Borat"" resembles nothing so much as a ""Candid Camera"" episode on crack.  Like Allen Funt, the originator of the format, Sacha Baron Cohen - along with his co-writers, Anthony Hines, Peter Baynham and Dan Mazer and director Larry Charles - generates laughs by tricking unsuspecting people into making complete and utter fools of themselves on camera.  Only, in this case, Cohen ventures much further into the realms of vulgarity and crudeness than Funt could ever have imagined or the television censors of his time would ever have permitted.As embodied by Cohen, Borat is a fictional character who hails from the very real West Asian country of Kazakhstan.  Convinced that he can learn some valuable lessons from the West that he can then bring back and share with his own people, Borat says goodbye to his impoverished village and heads to the United States to experience first hand the accoutrements of American culture.  The film chronicles the many absurd encounters he has with the folks he meets, mainly in Middle America, as he wends his way westward across the continent in search of his dream girl, Pamela Anderson.Some of the ""skits"" the filmmakers have come up with are sidesplitting and hilarious, some merely amusing, and others downright offensive (and all the funnier for being offensive, I might add).  The movie is least successful when it breaks away from the strict ""Candid Camera"" formula and shows us Borat on his own, out of sight of anyone not in on the joke, still carrying on the fiction.  In other words, the more ""scripted"" the movie appears, the less authentic it feels.  It should also be noted that there are times when one gets the impression that the people on whom the deception is being played are not quite as ignorant of the ruse as they appear to be, primarily because the placing of the camera often feels illogical if the spontaneity were truly real and genuine.  The one element that made ""Candid Camera"" utterly believable was that it was careful to keep the camera completely hidden throughout the course of the bit.  Here we wonder why it takes people so long to realize that they are indeed the target of a colossal joke (a prime example is when the old Jewish couple is walking up the stairs to bring food to the visiting Borat and the camera is filming them from OUTSIDE the room rather than sticking with Borat and his cohort within).However, what gives the movie its gravitas and heft, and takes it far beyond the level of mere ""Jackass""-type gimmickry is how Cohen manages to use his shtick to expose the bigotry and xenophobia that lie just beneath the surface of a certain segment of American society.  Yet, one should also point out that quite a number of these people are actually more tolerant and indulgent of Borat's inane antics than one might except any reasonable person to be (or than we ourselves might be if we were put in a similar situation).  Indeed, there's a certain cruelty to the film in that the individuals and groups he is mocking are actually treating him rather nicely at times.  The audience is allowed to feel superior to the people on screen in a way that might not be entirely justified.  ""Candid Camera"" always seemed innocent and harmless in its intentions; ""Borat"" definitely does not, which is both the strength and the weakness of the film.Still, love him or loathe him, one cannot help but sit back and admire the sheer courage and chutzpah Cohen displays in placing himself in what are, in actuality, some pretty hairy situations.  That he isn't ridden out of town on a rail, the outraged citizenry chasing close behind him with torches ablaze, is, perhaps, the most astonishing aspect of the movie.  It's the bald-faced audacity with which Cohen throws himself into his work - rather than the quality of the individual sketches themselves - that ultimately makes ""Borat"" so much fun to watch.",4,Candid Camera for the 21st Century,1176508800,"04 14, 2007",2007,3902,"['pseudo-documentary', 'Borat', 'nothing', 'so', 'much', 'Candid', 'Camera', 'episode', 'crack', 'Allen', 'Funt', 'originator', 'format', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'co-writers', 'Anthony', 'Hines', 'Peter', 'Baynham', 'Dan', 'Mazer', 'director', 'Larry', 'Charles', 'generates', 'laughs', 'tricking', 'unsuspecting', 'people', 'making', 'complete', 'utter', 'fools', 'camera', 'Only', 'case', 'Cohen', 'ventures', 'much', 'further', 'realms', 'vulgarity', 'crudeness', 'Funt', 'could', 'ever', 'have', 'imagined', 'television', 'censors', 'time', 'would', 'ever', 'have', 'permitted.As', 'embodied', 'Cohen', 'Borat', 'fictional', 'character', 'who', 'very', 'real', 'West', 'Asian', 'country', 'Kazakhstan', 'Convinced', 'can', 'learn', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'West', 'can', 'then', 'bring', 'back', 'share', 'own', 'people', 'Borat', 'goodbye', 'impoverished', 'village', 'heads', 'United', 'States', 'experience', 'first', 'hand', 'accoutrements', 'American', 'culture', 'film', 'many', 'absurd', 'encounters', 'folks', 'mainly', 'Middle', 'America', 'way', 'westward', 'continent', 'search', 'dream', 'girl', 'Pamela', 'Anderson.Some', 'skits', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'are', 'sidesplitting', 'hilarious', 'merely', 'amusing', 'others', 'downright', 'offensive', 'funnier', 'being', 'offensive', 'might', 'add', 'movie', 'least', 'successful', 'when', 'away', 'strict', 'Candid', 'Camera', 'formula', 'Borat', 'own', 'sight', 'anyone', 'not', 'joke', 'still', 'carrying', 'fiction', 'other', 'words', 'more', 'scripted', 'movie', 'less', 'authentic', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'noted', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'one', 'impression', 'people', 'whom', 'deception', 'being', 'played', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'ignorant', 'ruse', 'appear', 'be', 'primarily', 'placing', 'camera', 'often', 'illogical', 'spontaneity', 'were', 'truly', 'real', 'genuine', 'one', 'element', 'made', 'Candid', 'Camera', 'utterly', 'believable', 'was', 'was', 'careful', 'keep', 'camera', 'completely', 'hidden', 'course', 'bit', 'Here', 'wonder', 'why', 'people', 'so', 'long', 'realize', 'are', 'indeed', 'target', 'colossal', 'joke', 'prime', 'example', 'when', 'old', 'Jewish', 'couple', 'walking', 'up', 'stairs', 'bring', 'food', 'visiting', 'Borat', 'camera', 'filming', 'room', 'rather', 'sticking', 'Borat', 'cohort', '.However', 'what', 'movie', 'gravitas', 'heft', 'far', 'level', 'mere', 'Jackass', '-type', 'gimmickry', 'how', 'Cohen', 'use', 'shtick', 'expose', 'bigotry', 'xenophobia', 'just', 'beneath', 'surface', 'certain', 'segment', 'American', 'society', 'one', 'should', 'also', 'point', 'out', 'quite', 'number', 'people', 'are', 'actually', 'more', 'tolerant', 'indulgent', 'Borat', 'inane', 'antics', 'one', 'might', 'except', 'reasonable', 'person', 'be', 'might', 'be', 'were', 'put', 'similar', 'situation', 'Indeed', 'certain', 'cruelty', 'film', 'individuals', 'groups', 'mocking', 'are', 'actually', 'treating', 'rather', 'nicely', 'times', 'audience', 'allowed', 'feel', 'superior', 'people', 'screen', 'way', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'entirely', 'justified', 'Candid', 'Camera', 'always', 'seemed', 'innocent', 'harmless', 'intentions', 'Borat', 'definitely', 'not', 'strength', 'weakness', 'film.Still', 'love', 'loathe', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'sit', 'back', 'admire', 'sheer', 'courage', 'chutzpah', 'Cohen', 'placing', 'are', 'actuality', 'pretty', 'hairy', 'situations', ""n't"", 'ridden', 'town', 'rail', 'outraged', 'citizenry', 'chasing', 'close', 'torches', 'ablaze', 'perhaps', 'most', 'astonishing', 'aspect', 'movie', 'bald-faced', 'audacity', 'Cohen', 'work', 'rather', 'quality', 'individual', 'sketches', 'ultimately', 'Borat', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch']",N/A

(But nowhere in the comedy ballpark of, say, ""Hotshots Part Deux"" or ""The Court Jester."")  But would it have broken the professional reviewers' typing hands to hint at just how raunchy this movie is?  Well, there were the feces jokes, the constant potty language, etc. some of which were funny.  There were revealing moments of Americana, such as the now-infamous frat boys ride Borat took.What no one warned about were the scenes, filmed up close and personal from several vantage points, of Borat's fat pig of a manager setting his testicles and then his nude butt on Borat's face.  Jeez, even the maggots in Kazahkstan must have upchucked.  If you think that's hilarious, you must think a toilet is a laff riot.But back to just the regular raunch.  As comical as many Americans showed themselves to be, I can't help but think how nastily Sacha Cohen (Borat) treated some of them.  Maybe they had it coming, for they surely must have smelled a rat, or at least a little mouse, when this purported foreign hick strolled up to them with a filming crew.The many vignettes in this movie must have been largely staged, else Borat and his grotesque manager would have been in jail most of the time.  I've pointed out elsewhere too that some Amazon reviewers read too much into some of the supposedly revealing incidents in the movie.  The dinner party that Borat in every way undermined didn't break up because he brought a black woman to it, but because she was a whore.The movie made me curious.  How much was staged?  And secondly, when an actor reads the script and sees that millions of people will watch his repulsively bloated, naked body running around hallways and bedrooms and sitting on top of the star's face, what does he think?  ""Better this than the bread line""?  ""Anything for art""?  ""Oh boy, will this ever pad my resume""?Borat had some genuine laughs in it, but at an exorbitant price of sewer-wading.

In fact the audience that attended the same performance I did hardly laughed at all and this included several college age boys sitting nearby.  While some people laughed (as did I) there were no knee slappers. However the reviewers here all think this was a hilarious film.  I was not offended by it, I just didn't think it was funny.Borat is basically a series of Saturday Night Live skits loosely connected, much like Talledaga Nights, but Talledaga was actually hilarious.  In this film, which is a pseudo documentary the people he encounters are not actors but he deliberately pushes them by his rude behavior to react.  His personal conduct is appalling and cannot be excused on the basis of cultural differences.  He accosts people in New York who react negatively to his attempts at friendliness.  Having personally been accosted by various nuts in large cities I didn't find their reactions to be unusual.  Watching a bunch of college boys get drunk and make fools of themselves didn't strike me as especially funny and the college kids sitting near me apparently didn't either because this skit didn't get any laughs and only a few chuckles.  Of course some of the anti-semitic skits were funny - especially the bed and breakfast scene but these never reached the level of Mel Brooks's treatment of the same subject. Nevertheless because of the few real laughs in this movie I gave it two stars, but overall I thought it was rather dull and as it wore on --  less and less funny. Plus there were scenes that I thought didn't especially fit other than to shock the audience.  The masturbation scenes were sort of funny but to what purpose? The same was true of the nude wrestling scene -- sort of funny but what was the point and how did it fit into a ""documentary""?  I felt that making fun of people who were sincerely trying to help -- the Christian scene -- showed appalling bad manners and whose only purpose seemed to be to make fun of the people.  The same was true of the dinner party.  The Americans were trying to accomodate Borat but he continued to insult them until they reacted.  Would you have acted differently if a guest in your home was as rude and insulting?  Why was this supposed to be funny?  Not one laugh in the audience.  In fact this film is getting great reviews from Hollywood and New York but then those are the people who think the typical American is some sort of yahoo.I realize I am in the minority because I thought this film was only mildly funny and hardly worth the money.

This not usually my type of movie, the huge success of it was a clear consequence of all the propaganda and publicity surrounding it (which by the way is included as bonus material in this DVD release), I was a little reluctant to watch it at the movie theaters and I waited to watch it on DVD.Man I loved this film, the ""innocence"" of the character may be funny to a lot of people, but that is precisely what Sacha Baron Cohen used as a mean to get the worst of the people interacting with him, by provoking everyone surrounding him while pretending to be an innocent character from Kazakhstan, many of the more bizarre lines in this film come from the people around him and not Borat himself. This of course generated a lot of legal problems when the film was released that did nothing but give the movie more publicity than the one it already had.I still find it hard to believe he was able to leave the rodeo after insulting all the people in the place, there are lots of situations in which Borat does nothing but set the situation for people to show what they really think or believe (a police officer tells him to be ready to be stopped in his van lots of times because of his appearance, when Borat asks why, the officer simply replies ""that's the way it is in America"")I am not saying of course this is a serious film, it can be outrageous, disgusting, but funny in the end. This release contains deleted material that I believe could have been better that some things that were left in the film (check out the employee at the convenience store when he tries to explain that in America there can be many different types of cheese and also see Borat trying to buy a dog to have ""sexy time"" and then eat it)It also includes a section for ""Global Propaganda"" that contains interviews with Connan O Brien, Saturday night Live and Jay Leno with Martha Stewart (my personal favorite) It is also funny to see the way Borat thanks Michael Moore at a film festival when he tries to thank him. Another bonus material to be found is the bizarre music infomercial (advertising the music from Kazakhstan) released on the web to promote the film.Again, this may not be my regular type of film but it sure had me laughing, it is a film that beyond the jokes it might leave you with a couple things to think about.",4,Cultural learnings indeed,1183939200,"07 9, 2007",2007,2356,"['irreverent', 'film', 'little', 'left', 'be', 'said', 'not', 'usually', 'type', 'movie', 'huge', 'success', 'was', 'clear', 'consequence', 'propaganda', 'publicity', 'surrounding', 'way', 'included', 'bonus', 'material', 'DVD', 'release', 'was', 'little', 'reluctant', 'watch', 'movie', 'theaters', 'waited', 'watch', 'DVD.Man', 'loved', 'film', 'innocence', 'character', 'may', 'be', 'funny', 'lot', 'people', 'precisely', 'what', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'used', 'mean', 'get', 'worst', 'people', 'interacting', 'provoking', 'everyone', 'surrounding', 'pretending', 'be', 'innocent', 'character', 'Kazakhstan', 'many', 'more', 'bizarre', 'lines', 'film', 'come', 'people', 'not', 'Borat', 'course', 'generated', 'lot', 'legal', 'problems', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'did', 'nothing', 'give', 'movie', 'more', 'publicity', 'one', 'already', 'still', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'was', 'able', 'leave', 'rodeo', 'insulting', 'people', 'place', 'are', 'lots', 'situations', 'Borat', 'nothing', 'set', 'situation', 'people', 'show', 'what', 'really', 'think', 'believe', 'police', 'officer', 'be', 'ready', 'be', 'stopped', 'van', 'lots', 'times', 'appearance', 'when', 'Borat', 'why', 'officer', 'simply', 'way', 'America', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'course', 'serious', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'outrageous', 'disgusting', 'funny', 'end', 'release', 'deleted', 'material', 'believe', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'things', 'were', 'left', 'film', 'check', 'out', 'employee', 'convenience', 'store', 'when', 'explain', 'America', 'can', 'be', 'many', 'different', 'types', 'cheese', 'also', 'see', 'Borat', 'trying', 'buy', 'dog', 'have', 'sexy', 'time', 'then', 'eat', 'also', 'section', 'Global', 'Propaganda', 'interviews', 'Connan', 'O', 'Brien', 'Saturday', 'night', 'Live', 'Jay', 'Leno', 'Martha', 'Stewart', 'personal', 'favorite', 'also', 'funny', 'see', 'way', 'Borat', 'thanks', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'film', 'festival', 'when', 'thank', 'bonus', 'material', 'be', 'found', 'bizarre', 'music', 'infomercial', 'advertising', 'music', 'Kazakhstan', 'released', 'web', 'promote', 'film.Again', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'regular', 'type', 'film', 'sure', 'had', 'laughing', 'film', 'jokes', 'might', 'leave', 'couple', 'things', 'think']",N/A

Yes, ""Borat.""It is not the slickest comedy, and surely not the funniest, but its timely fusion of ingredients - satire, puns, visual gags, verbal gaffes, grossly-gross nudie stuff - make it irresistible and effective. Let's face it: It's the 10-car pileup on the Interstate. Our eyes are wide, our necks are wrenched and our mouths are slack in disbelief.Officially titled ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America For Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,"" the film stars comedian Sacha Baron Cohen as the title character, a wild-looking, anti-Semitic buffoon who plays up every stereotype Americans have about the Third World and Eastern Europe.Especially the anti-Semitism, which is revealed in an annual Kazak ritual so terrifically offensive (and creative) that writing about it won't do it justice. Several set pieces in ""Borat"" fall into that category. They work solely in the context of the character, not outside him. The best parts of the movie are the kind of satire you have to leave at the theater door.Doesn't mean you can't go back.So Borat is sent to New York City with his assistant (Ken Davitian) for cultural reports, and he finds a hostile city unwilling to receive his customary greeting of a kiss. His work there is unsuccessful. Then he sees Pamela Anderson on ""Baywatch,"" finds out she lives in Malibu, Calif., and treks across the country in a used ice cream truck with his assistant. And a pet bear.He makes stops, mostly in the South, on his way to California. In scenes that Cohen and director Larry Charles insist are real, Borat appears on a morning show, sings at a rodeo and breaks up a Southern dining club by inviting an overweight black prostitute named Lunell.Some of ""Borat"" really is a crass reworking of ""Candid Camera,"" as this fictional reporter, through innocent, Third World ignorance, forces his subjects to confront his skewed morality or cheerfully join him. A couple do, including some fraternity members in an RV. If there is one scene that feels forced in ""Borat,"" it's this one. These guys seem to be cranking up their misogyny a few too many decibels.But one sequence is hilariously real, and that's a nude wrestling match between Cohen and Davitian, who is, well, a big man. The two are fighting WWE-style - except that it's no act - and I've never seen anything ? quite ? like ? it. It works on three levels: As a shock fest, a study in fight dynamics and a play on the homophobic Borat's complete willingness to engage in the grapple.What we're seeing is the id run amok, a movie that pretends as if children grew into full-size adults within the first 10 years of their lives, lacking an understanding in subversion and dark corners of the human heart. That's deep talk for what seems like such a goofy movie, but comedy occasionally does what drama cannot by throwing truth on a tilt to bring a shaded corner into light.We know that ""Borat"" is after more than cheap laughs because chunks of it just don't work. For me, anyway. The Pam Anderson material is dumb and overdone, but then, I'm no fan of Anderson. The dinner party sequence was lame, and Cohen is a little needlessly mean. If Jews want to accuse Cohen, who is Jewish, of self-hate, they could, but his use of anti-Semitism mostly highlights its stupidity.In other words, it's not searching, as most American comedies do, for a lowest common denominator, but erecting its own standard upon which to be judged. Cohen is a cagey, clever talent; while ""Borat"" is often improvised, the comedian had to map out these targets and create a humor that could survive the length of a feature film and not just a skit.""Borat"" called its shot, slugged it into the cheap seats and just introduced us to the next year's No. 1 Halloween costume.

Yes, Sacha Baron (Baruch) Cohen is Jewish and no, Borat is not a real person. For the uninitiated, Mr. Cohen is very much like this generation's Andy Kaufman, a comedian who purposely antagonizes people and fearlessly faces retaliation from them. Borat is akin to Kaufman's ""Latka Gravas"" character, a stranger in a strange land whose (fictional) culture is so far removed from that of this foreign country that he cannot assimilate. The crux of the film, of course, is to emphasize aspects of American culture. In the film, Borat travels from his native Kazakhstan to the United States in order to glean ""cultural learnings."" He had to act quite outrageously in order to elicit a response from New Yorkers, though most other Americans he encountered found most everything he did offensive. I'm not entirely convinced he made the film so much to show Americans' biases as much as merely to evoke our common cultural traits. I watched this film with a girlfriend, who hated it with a passion and did not see the point of making it because ""everyone knows this is the way Americans are."" Yet, she came to this country from Bangladesh at age seventeen and has experienced firsthand some of the bigotry exhibited in the film. At the other extreme, my mother, who has lived in Ohio her entire life, considers the portrayal of the dysfunction in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" to be ""unrealistic"" and over the top. It seems to me Americans do not know one another as well as one would think. So, why is this film important now? What is Mr. Cohen, who is English, trying to say by making this film? Perhaps he thinks Americans are too full of ourselves, that we are hubristic and believe we can do whatever we want with the world? Perhaps he wants to divide the Americans who watch the film, to dissociate ourselves from one another along ethnic, religious or other cultural lines? Maybe he wants to introduce the rest of the world to genuine America? Perhaps it is to draw Americans closer together, to get us to embrace our cultural heritage (as the antique store owner in Dallas states)?

1047493,A2QAUMR0V33GC9,B000MMMT9G,"Scot Carr ""Film and book phanatic""","[3, 4]","It takes a certain kind of genious to recycle an old ""Candid Camera"" idea and make it relavently funny in the new century.  Sacha Baron Cohen is THAT kind of genious.Most people know the origins of the bumbling, cheerful, optimistic, innocent, bigoted, anti-gay and anti-semitic reporter from a formerly Soviet country few people know anything about.  Cohen proves that Andy Kaufmann may not have been crazy after all, just merely born ahead of his time.  He remains totally in character in a number of diverse situations many people have found themselves in, but never saw through totally clueless eyes.  It's easy to see how people can be taken in by his act, as Cohen really gives his all in performing the role he's chosen to (nicely) torture Americans (and others, to be fair).  I see why people shown in this movie would be angry to be in it, as at best, we see them trying like all Hell to be nice to someone so obviously lacking cultural literacy about the ""U S and A,"" and at worst see their own prejudices flown as high as any freak-flag imaginable.This is also where I've discovered a film that is as much showing our darknesses we'd rather keep hidden as having fun with them.  How much of the folks saying what they say is ""playing along"" with someone who doesn't know thing one about the United States and how much is being allowed because of it to say what they really think about gays, Jews, etc., is what we don't know.  Perhaps the number of suits coming up against Cohen tells us this.  If true, that's dispirating because ""Borat"" to me is telling us what hasn't changed about people.  We're still as much afraid of the ""different"" amongst us as he is, and while we try to keep it well hidden, our bigotry still has a tendancy to sneak out when we least expect it, such as when we're trying to not be shocked ourselves when someone else makes inappropriate comments.In trying to make it as much as crude ""documentary"" as possible, Cohen and his merry crew have the prerequisite background shots about Borat and his (fictionalized) country.  We also see shots ""behind the scenes"" with his producer, usually these involve dealing with a situation they'd rather not be in (like the bed-and-breakfast owned by a sweet elderly Jewish couple).  While necessary, these are the weakest part of the film (except for certain naked jokes involving Borat - they are as funny as the interviews themselves).  The best bits are the interviews and real-life moments.  People actually don't know what to make of the silly man who says obnoxious things so cheerily, and that's what makes ""Borat"" so funny - real life and how WE deal with it.So, if you're looking for a movie-film that is laugh-out-loud funny, you could do worse that ""Borat.""  If you're looking for an out-of-kilter mirror on society, you could also do worse than ""Borat.""

Sacha Baron Cohen certainly didn't break new ground with the Borat character in the full-length feature film Borat. Indeed, the Borat character was a regular part of the Ali G show first popularized in the UK in 2000 and introduced to US viewers via HBO in 2004.So technically, all the hub-bub on the one side of the fence about Borat being a ""racist"" character or a misrepresentation of the Kazakhstan people is about 7 years late. And the suggestion on the other side of the fence that Borat is the funniest movie or character to come along in years is way overrated.The Borat character is funny. But what is funnier is watching the reaction to the character by the people that he is duping. Similarly, Cohen's Ali G character (a stereotypical hip-hop, British ghetto banger TV host) and the Bruno character (a stereotypical gay mannerismed TV host) have the same modus operandi........And that modus operandi is Socratic irony. The characters deliberately feign ignorance in order to expose weakness in another's position. The result: most of the time hilarity. Whether it's Borat, Ali G or Bruno, the laughs are less to each character's behavior and more to the reaction of the person being duped and the commitment that people have to being politically correct so as not to question the ridiculous opinions and questions that Cohen's characters come up with. Cohen's characters' naive stupidity make his victims look equally stupid...Socratic irony. (The only victim that I ever saw that had enough intelligence to walk out of the situation without any regard to whether or not he was offending the Cohen character was Donald Trump.)Comparitively, if what we're really after here are public reactions to pranks and gags, you can get it all for free on YouTube. Cohen just has a better knack for executing his gags on VIPs. Therefore, to make a full length movie that developed the Borat character was a bit overkill for me. A movie that was similar to Da Ali G Show that mixed up the characters a bit would have kept the gags a bit more fresh.So do you want to see some funny pranks and gags that get a bit tired by the end of full length feature film about just the Borat character? Then the Borat movie is for you. Would you rather see it mixed up a bit between different characters? Then go with Da Ali G Show seasonal DVD releases. You want pranks and gags for free? Go to YouTube.But don't be fooled into being offended by any of the Cohen characters. They are not real; the man behind the mask really isn't that stupid. He's trying to make YOU look stupid.

Its central character happily revels in unabashed jingoism, sexual promiscuity, and open bigotry regarding assorted minorities. Because he's allegedly from an underdeveloped country, many of his unwitting American hosts display a hilarious - because politically correct - impotence in the presence of his barbarism. By the same token, he is able to uncover less overt, though similarly barbaric, tendencies among most of the various Americans from assorted geographical regions he encounters on his cross country journey. Civilization is shown, as a result, to be a very thin veneer coating self-absorbed Manhattanites,  southern Frat Boys, and southwest rodeo attendees. Baron Cohen sees unreflective nationalism, the worship of celebrity, and an adolescent sexual outlook as the true religion both of Borat, his TV talking head from Kazakhstan, and of any number of the Americans he meets.

Sacha Baron Cohen, originating on HBO's ""Da Ali G Show"" stars as the delightful Kazakhstani journalist who has been sent to America to make a documentary on cultural differences. Borat starts out with a bang, from the very first line which is ""Jag sez mais! A-my name a-Borat!"" In Borat, the ACTUAL country of Kazakhstan is made out to be a dump full of prostitutes, animal rapists, town abortionists, and a country that has yet to discover DVDs and Music CDs, and are instead stuck with the ""VCR recorders"" and ""play cassettes."" The first five minutes of the movie is filmed in a studio. Then, for the remaining 75 minutes, Borat travels to America in an absolutely uncut, uncensored, unscripted, and completely unexpected and daring film stunt. Throughout the movie, Borat talks to American citizens: normal guys off the street of New York, rich home owners, slums, even a pair of old Jewish people owning a bed and breakfast. And, then, Sacha Baron Cohen does what he does best: makes people look stupid. Eventually, Borat falls in love with Pamela Anderson and sets off on a cross-country journey to California to make her his wife. The movie is disgusting, revolting, shocking, vulgar, crude, full of sexual jokes, intentional racial prejudice, and is just about insulting to every person in the audience. However, it is without a doubt, the funniest movie I have seen in 2006!! While watching the film you really have to put all the crude scenes and jokes beside you and just appreciate the sheer genius of Sacha Baron Cohen and see that actually, behind all the crude childish stuff, this movie is SMART and ultimately RIGHT! I laughed so hard my throat hurt and head ached after leaving the theater, plus I had a Cherry Coke stain on my pants that appeared sometime during the movie, as the drink had come out of my nose. I can see why some people don't like it, including the Kazakh government, but you need to relax and just take it for what it is: a movie. A movie filmed with no script, no rules, no boundaries, and a bunch of unexpecting and unlucky Americans. And you know what the best part is? After leaving the theater, the first thought to run through your head will be ""Wow. America truly does suck."" See it for yourself.

In one scene he's shown riding in a car to go off to America, and when the camera zooms out, we see that the car is actually being pulled by a horse and buggy.  Then there's a scene where Borat sings his country's national anthem at a rodeo and upsets the entire patriotic audience.  And all through the movie Borat's broken English alone is enough to make me chuckle.When Borat isn't ultra-offensive, it switches to being just plain silly.

This is my 50th Amazon review, and I generally only review goods, books or movies that I really like because I want to help shed some light on them for other people.  Only one other time was I moved to give a negative review to something.  I will preface my review by saying that it comes from a very personal place.As an artist myself, I think artists' efforts should be celebrated.  I'm also all for artistic freedom. However, although I found much to like in this movie, on balance I found it to be just excessively vulgar.  I like satire and I appreciated the fact that BORAT exposes elements of sexism and racism and almost every other kind of ""ism.""  I especially appreciated the commentary on America's hyper-patriotism.But I thought the movie just went too far in its vulgarity and, as such, may be doing more harm to our society than good.  We already live in a society where crudeness is rewarded by big money (Don Imus, Howard Stern).  This in itself is a problem.  Within that context, I find myself wondering why BORAT had to push the envelope so much:  I just didn't think it needed to.  So much of it was very, very funny:  the running of the Jews, the scenes with the humor coach and the feminists, the scene where Borat is buying the car and is looking for a p*s** magnet.  But other scenes are just too over the top:  the nude wrestling match, the photograph of a [...], the [...] scene--why does the movie need these?  For shock value?  I am perplexed, truly.I also am a little concerned that many people won't understand that this is a satire.  There is a fine line between attacking social conventions with humor and condoning those social conventions.  I think this distinction is not always clear in BORAT.It does pain me to say these things, because there is much to like in BORAT.  But we live in such a social climate of crass vulgarity these days that I find myself disappointed in the movie ultimately because I think it may be contributing to a climate of shallowness and an attitude of ""anything goes.""  Many of my friends and colleagues like this movie, but I am troubled by it, and I think the maker of the film could have made better choices.",2,It's just too vulgar,1176681600,"04 16, 2007",2007,2247,"['know', 'am', 'probably', 'minority', 'opinion', 'movie', '50th', 'Amazon', 'review', 'generally', 'only', 'review', 'goods', 'books', 'movies', 'really', 'want', 'help', 'shed', 'light', 'other', 'people', 'Only', 'one', 'other', 'time', 'was', 'moved', 'give', 'negative', 'review', 'something', 'will', 'preface', 'review', 'saying', 'very', 'personal', 'place.As', 'artist', 'think', 'artists', 'efforts', 'should', 'be', 'celebrated', ""'m"", 'also', 'artistic', 'freedom', 'However', 'found', 'much', 'like', 'movie', 'balance', 'found', 'be', 'just', 'excessively', 'vulgar', 'like', 'satire', 'appreciated', 'fact', 'BORAT', 'elements', 'sexism', 'racism', 'almost', 'other', 'kind', 'ism', 'especially', 'appreciated', 'commentary', 'America', 'hyper-patriotism.But', 'thought', 'movie', 'just', 'went', 'too', 'far', 'vulgarity', 'such', 'may', 'be', 'doing', 'more', 'harm', 'society', 'good', 'already', 'live', 'society', 'where', 'crudeness', 'rewarded', 'big', 'money', 'Don', 'Imus', 'Howard', 'Stern', 'problem', 'context', 'find', 'wondering', 'why', 'BORAT', 'had', 'push', 'envelope', 'so', 'much', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'needed', 'So', 'much', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'running', 'Jews', 'scenes', 'humor', 'coach', 'feminists', 'scene', 'where', 'Borat', 'buying', 'car', 'looking', 'p*s**', 'magnet', 'other', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'top', 'nude', 'wrestling', 'match', 'photograph', '[', ']', '[', ']', 'scene', 'why', 'movie', 'shock', 'value', 'am', 'perplexed', 'truly.I', 'also', 'am', 'little', 'concerned', 'many', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'understand', 'satire', 'fine', 'line', 'attacking', 'social', 'conventions', 'humor', 'condoning', 'social', 'conventions', 'think', 'distinction', 'not', 'always', 'clear', 'BORAT.It', 'pain', 'say', 'things', 'much', 'like', 'BORAT', 'live', 'social', 'climate', 'crass', 'vulgarity', 'days', 'find', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'contributing', 'climate', 'shallowness', 'attitude', 'anything', 'Many', 'friends', 'colleagues', 'movie', 'am', 'troubled', 'think', 'maker', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'choices']",N/A

He has been charged, by his government, with creating a documentary to improve the financial fortunes of his country. His journey? To travel to America and find out how he can make his country more like the United States and increase tourism and revenue. Arriving in New York, he greets people on the street like he would at home, trying to shake their hands and kiss them on both cheeks. Naturally, most of the people run away from him, swearing at the freak. His longtime producer, Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitian), tries to keep him on track, but Borat begins watching American television in his hotel room and comes across a re-run of ""Baywatch"". Instantly, he becomes completely enamored of Pamela Anderson and decides he will travel to California and marry her. His producer is reluctant, but Borat convinces him and they set off on their journey after purchasing an old ice cream truck. Along the way, they meet many interesting people. But will he be able to find Pamela Anderson?""Borat"", the brainchild of Sacha Baron Cohen, a British comedian, who seems to have a knack for creating truly off-center characters (he was the most memorable voice in ""Madagascar"" and the most memorable character in ""Talladega Nights"") and directed by Larry Charles (one of the writer/ producers involved in ""Seinfeld"", ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" and other television projects), is a truly funny, truly outrageous and truly memorable film. It is not a perfect film, but it is extremely funny and extremely un-politically correct.From the moment Borat begins introducing us to the people of his village, we know we are in for a strange trip. He quickly exposes us to the character's feelings, philosophies, prejudices and phobias. We learn a little about his country and squirm in our seats. You just can't say the things he says in our country. It isn't politically correct and people would get upset. Will he fit in our country?What Cohen does here is almost brilliant. He is making fun of our preconceived notions of what Kazakhstan is like because we know little, if anything, about the country. We expect it to look like he is portraying it. He merely amplifies the image, making it more of a caricature. We expect them to use horses to pull their cars, to marry young and have many children and we expect them to carry a rooster in their luggage.Then he flies to New York.In New York, the humor continues, but it changes focus. We are laughing at Borat's exchanges with real people, but we are also laughing at their interactions with him. New Yorkers run from him, or swear at him, as soon as he approaches, trying to shake their hand or to kiss them on the cheek.All of these interactions appear to be completely improvised. The people he meets along the journey appear to be real ""normal"" people who have no idea who Borat really is. They seem to believe they are actually interacting with a reporter from a foreign country that many mistakenly refer to as Russia. If this is true, it is simply amazing to me many of these people are not threatening legal action. They don't come off well and that is what makes much of this humor all the more outstanding. And difficult to watch. As we are laughing at these statements, we are also uncomfortable because even though we know people can't still think this way, we know people still think this way.At a rodeo, he is invited to sing the National Anthem. Before hand, he tries to kiss a man he has just met on the cheeks. He says ""Don't do that, that's what those guys who float around do"", waving his hand at his wrist, and then makes a comment about them that is truly shocking. People really still believe these things? Amazing. Then, when he steps out to begin singing, he says ""I support your war of terror"". The audience cheers because no one seems to really hear what he is saying. They hear the words ""war"" and ""terror"" and immediately assume he is showing a sign of support. Later, after taking an etiquette class, he meets with a group of well-off Southerners for a formal dinner. They try to understand the cultural differences and build a bridge between the cultures, but when his guest arrives, everything turns for the worst.The brilliance of this comedy comes from the fact that we are, initially, laughing at his backwards little country, and all of their eccentricities, then we are laughing at our backwards little country and all of our eccentrics.Cohen does an amazing job of bringing this character to life. Early on, we realize Borat shares his countries fear of and hatred for people of Jewish ancestry. At no point does he ever back off or lessen this viewpoint. We watch the running of ""the Jew"" in his village. Later, he and his producer stop at a bed and breakfast and learn the couple who own it are Jewish. They shrink back in horror, but feel trapped. Throughout the film, Cohen maintains all of the characters eccentricities, creating an extremely consistent and believable character. This is all the more interesting and amazing when you consider how broad the comedy is. Generally, this type of character would laugh at himself, trying to clue us in to the joke, but he doesn't. He doesn't seem to realize there is a joke and as we continue to watch, we begin to think perhaps we are watching a documentary.""Borat"" contains a lot of laughs, and they are consistent throughout. But there is a lot of truly adult stuff. I was surprised by the amount of full frontal male nudity. In one scene, Borat and his manager get into a fight and begin rolling around their hotel room, completely nude. Its a funny scene, but also sophomoric, because the fight degenerates into a bunch of homoerotic icons. The main purpose of the joke, besides the homoerotic references, seems to be the fact Borat's manager is extremely overweight. Not only are they guys, who fall into a bunch of sexual positions, but one guy is extremely fat. They are doing the two things many might find disgusting. Having sex with a man. And having sex with an overweight person. This was not the highlight of the film, but because it is shocking it is still funny.The film is technically brilliant. Every frame has been given a grainy image, to make it appear the Kazakh crew is using old video equipment, which is probably new to them. Every time a new person appears on screen, there is a title in Borat's native language with the American translation superimposed sloppily over the top. The film also resembles any propaganda film we have seen from another country, the same sort of phony staged introductions, the same awkward moments, the grainy footage looks like it has been played through ten too many bad elementary school projectors.In the area where I live, many matinee screenings sold out. I also saw that many evening shows were sold out very early on each day of the opening weekend. This rarely happens. When it does, it is usually an indication the film will have a monstrous opening weekend. Not really surprising because Cohen has been everywhere, always in character; ""Saturday Night Live"", ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart"" and his show has a cult following. This, and the universally glowing reviews, have apparently created a phenomenon. Amazingly, the film opened on about 900 screens, about half of a normal studio release. Fox has apparently seen the writing on the wall and already ordered a sequel.That is good news. High five.",4,Good News.

His comments about Jews are based on his culture. It would be like how people here want all the rebels in Iraq (the ""terrorists"") dead for simply defending their country. Looking at it from their point of view, or anyone else's, you can understand why Borat would take the position he does. In his culture it's okay to have sex with your sister, make fun of retards, treat women like garbage (though you can also say we do that here to some extent), and make fun of homo's. That's his culture, his way of life, and it just so happens that he is also a FICTIONAL character. The genius behind Sasha's character is that he's thrown into situations deemed by our culture as normal, but by his standards is much different and probably weird. Borat is trying to learn about us and how we think and act.To call him racist or sexist is to judge him based on our ""elite"" standards. I agree, though, that all human beings should be treated with dignity and respect and no one should be ridiculed for their beliefs. The scene where Borat invites the ""escort"" to the uppity dinner is a perfect example of the ridiculous standards American people have. The guests (all religious tight-@$$es) were interested in Borat like one would be interested in some alien creature. But invite a black woman into their home and they all of a sudden ""have to be going."" It just shows the real raw nature of American people, ""elite-""American people, and how we simply judge everything and are really not sympathetic.This was not always the case in this country, but I'm slipping into a historical rant about the problems with this country. The problems with this movie is that most people who don't get ""the joke"" are just embarrassed about seeing the way we really are.

You have to admire Cohen's cajones (which are on view in more ways than one) as he goes above and beyond the call of duty in his determination to stay in character no matter how hostile the environment he's helped to create. It's pretty easy to spot the faked or partialy faked sequences - the friendly Jewish couple who rent them a room, the children at the ice cream truck, the Pamela Anderson finale - and most of the victims that aren't faked are more than deserving of their fate (the racist rodeo impresario, the frat boys) or handle themselves well (the feminists).

1047530,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000MMMT9G,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","I first learned of the character of Borat this past summer from a friend of mine who introduced me to DA ALI G SHOW. I found the sketches that I watched to be rather intriguing and at time quite humorous. Sacha Baron Cohen's portrayal of the faux-Kazakhstanian journalist reminded me of another comedian that I greatly admired, Andy Kaufman. Cohen's Borat most resembles Kaufman's Latka Gravas. However, Borat is a far more crude and rude type of character than Latka ever was.The movie is ""filmed"" in a grainy, mockumentary style. According to the plot of the film, Borat has been sent to America by the Kazakhstan government to observe the people in the United States and bring back what he learns so that the lives of the Kazakhstan people can be improved by the knowledge he brings back. Borat and his comrade, Azamat Bagato (Ken Davitian) begin their journey in New York City. Actually, they are supposed to stay in New York, but after Borat views an episode of Baywatch on television, he decides he has to go to California to find Pamela Anderson and marry her. Thus begins a cross-country excursion that takes Borat through Georgia and Texas and eventually California. Along the way, Borat stays at a bed & breakfast operated by an elderly Jewish couple, buys a black bear as a guard pet, befriends a prostitute, causes havoc at a local television station, scares children, and offends lots of people.There are moments when the movie is hilarious and there are other times when the film is quite insightful and becomes an almost brilliant dark satire into the American subconscious. However, more often than not, BORAT (the movie not the character) is so pretentious that it is comes off as being a boring travelogue. There are some very funny bits that occur (the chicken on the subway made me chuckle and I couldn't help but laugh when Borat was able to stand his ground against a group of feminists). There are also some times when the movie shows part of the bigotry that many people in America have, such as when Borat asks a gun owner about which gun is best to kill a Jew, when Borat is talking with an older cowman before a rodeo, and when Borat goes on a drinking spree with some college students. There are people in the United States who still harbor great hatred towards people of different races and religions. But, we already knew that, didn't we. In that sense, BORAT fails as a satire because it doesn't show the audience anything new that we didn't know and it doesn't offer any real suggestions in curing those problems.There are many moments in BORAT that are intended to be funny and illustrate how backward American people are, but instead of doing that the film illustrates just how kind and giving American people tend to be. While lost in a ""rough"" area of Atlanta, Georgia Borat is befriended by a group of young black men (of course this is later used to show how racist certain hotel people are). While eating dinner at the home of a genteel Southern family, the hosts go out of their way to accommodate Borat and make him feel welcome; they go far and above what people would consider acceptable, but they are good and kind people. In a scene that is meant to be funny, Borat is embraced by a Pentecostal church--despite what one might believe about their religious practices, the people at the church embrace Borat. Even the group of drunken college students, who spout various racist comments, befriend Borat and seek to comfort him during a trying time.There are also some moments in the movie that are intended to be funny, but have no humour value whatsoever. For instance, there is a scene where Borat and Azamat get into an argument and begin wrestling naked in their hotel room. The wrestling match continues throughout the hotel and into the stage of a conference room of the hotel where a dinner is being held. Apparently, two naked men wrestling with each other in various sexually-suggestive positions is supposed to be laugh-out-loud hilarious. I just didn't get it. It was unnecessary and served no value whatsoever.Having seen some of the Borat skits from THE ALI G SHOW, having been intrigued by the preview for BORAT, and having heard so much of the hype, I was disappointed by BORAT the movie. It wasn't the laugh-out-loud comedy I thought it was going to be and neither was it the full-blown dark satire I had heard that it was. The film contains elements of both, but the movie doesn't live up to the hype. The film most resembles a SNL movie, but the grainy film style makes it more entertaining than most of those. Many high school and college students will love this film, but unless you're in those crowds are work with them, you probably won't find BORAT very entertaining at all.",3,"Sometimes Funny, Sometimes

The driving lesson is outrageously funny as a real driving instructor, oblivious to the fact that Cohen is acting, tries to cope with Borat's attempts to drink booze while shouting obscenities at other drivers. You will fall down laughing. Another great segment is the ride in the RV with the sexist college frat boys. Cutting edge stuff. However, a lot of the other material falls flat. The rodeo is embarrassing. The nude wrestling scene could have used a good edit. Pamela Anderson obviously knew who Cohen was when he appeared at her ""book signing"" and it's just not spontaneous. Also -- what happened to the song, ""Throw the J**s down the well so my country can be free?"" I heard it prior to the film's release; it really made you think about the convenience anti-semitism provides to some folks and, at the same time, was terribly funny. Much better than the National Anthem sequence at the rodeo. Gone in the R-rated version. Also, warning - the scatological humor in ""Borat"" is just revolting. See the film -- Cohen is amazing. But I'm wondering where he can go from here. I hope his next film has a better editor and is a bit better crafted.",4,"Original, but uneven",1173312000,"03 8, 2007",2007,1529,"['expected', 'be', 'funniest', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'Well', 'not', 'However', 'original', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'put', 'forth', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'performance', 'Borat', 'opinion', 'funniest', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'Cohen', 'Borat', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'idea', 'who', 'attempts', 'give', 'men', 'welcome', 'kisses', 'streets', 'NY', 'are', 'hysterical', 'driving', 'lesson', 'outrageously', 'funny', 'real', 'driving', 'instructor', 'oblivious', 'fact', 'Cohen', 'acting', 'tries', 'cope', 'Borat', 'attempts', 'drink', 'booze', 'shouting', 'obscenities', 'other', 'drivers', 'will', 'fall', 'down', 'laughing', 'great', 'segment', 'ride', 'RV', 'sexist', 'college', 'frat', 'boys', 'Cutting', 'edge', 'stuff', 'However', 'lot', 'other', 'material', 'flat', 'rodeo', 'embarrassing', 'nude', 'wrestling', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'good', 'edit', 'Pamela', 'Anderson', 'obviously', 'knew', 'who', 'Cohen', 'was', 'when', 'appeared', 'book', 'signing', 'just', 'not', 'spontaneous', 'Also', 'what', 'happened', 'song', 'Throw', 'J**s', 'well', 'country', 'can', 'be', 'free', 'heard', 'prior', 'film', 'release', 'really', 'made', 'think', 'convenience', 'anti-semitism', 'folks', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'terribly', 'funny', 'Much', 'better', 'National', 'Anthem', 'sequence', 'rodeo', 'Gone', 'R-rated', 'version', 'Also', 'warning', 'scatological', 'humor', 'Borat', 'just', 'revolting', 'See', 'film', 'Cohen', 'amazing', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'where', 'can', 'go', 'here', 'hope', 'next', 'film', 'better', 'editor', 'bit', 'better', 'crafted']",N/A

I guess being hip to offensiveness is the new cool.It seemed fitting that upon arriving home after I saw this movie Ichannel surfed past a Comedy Channel ""roast"" of Pamela Anderson. Inthat ode to maximizing the ratio of dollars earned per ounce of IQpresent, several people - some famous - pulled out all the stops (onesurmises there were no stops left to pull) to scrape through the barrelbottom to reach previously unplumbed depths of mean-spirited, profanepuerility. It's hard to call it humour.Borat slides right in to that same vein. Or does it?When I found myself laughing constantly and often uncontrollablythrough ""There's Something about Mary"" I figured then that I could beas caught up in potty humour as much as anyone. Borat, however, goeswell beyond ""Mary's"" silly and simple sight gags (related often to themiddle third of the human body). In that movie, the humour is basedupon two factors: the reaction to the initial gag, and also theviewer's realization of their reaction to the gag - they laugh a secondtime at themselves when they realize they laughed at such silly stuff.Monty Python was often similar.Borat, in contrast, works off a very different premise.First of all, it is about deception. Sure it ""pokes fun"" at attitudestowards others. In the global scheme of things of over 6 billion""others"", Cohen leaves us with the suggestion that the way to deal withdiversity is ridicule. Cohen suggests that the ridicule need not stopwhen one is invited into anothers house for dinner - it's OK to leave aturd beside your plate on the way out. That'll fix 'em so they can allbe like... like.... who? Which of the >6 billion is the correct modelthat we should all follow?I don't believe that Cohen and the rest of the production team was outto provide moral guidance or even point out anomalies in our society. Ithink it's likely that he was simply out to be as ridiculouslyoffensive as possible and choosing the race, moral, cultural & religious subjectswas simply the vehicle for doing that and, besides, harming animals is against the law.As for the rating (1 out of 10), I had considered initially rating itmuch higher. The logic goes like this: It provoked me into thinkingdeeply about my reaction -> thought-provoking cinema is a good thing ->forces a re-examination of both what I know and my moral foundation ->reinforces (or not) my personal moral beliefs -> I should be thankfulto the film-maker.Ultimately, however, it made me think: What does this really say aboutour society and how much we value other people and diversity of viewsand cultures? This is rhetorical but it's not even the movieitself that most concerns me but the effusive reaction to it from paidcritics and its box-office popularity. But then, they effused over Eyes Wide Shut as well.What does it say that we honour a person simply because they have apathologically low level of inhibition and decency? That we would placesuch a person in the same league - through awards - as the true cinemaartists simply because he pushes the envelope of offensiveness? In oursociety, we view this as being behaviour to strive for and worthrewarding? Now that I have seen the movie I can question why Cohen waseven nominated - much less having won - at the Golden Globes.Best actor? He has the range of a toddler trying to hit the toilet heis sitting on.Similarly, that the Academy would nominate anything about this film foran Oscar - best adapted sceenplay...?
