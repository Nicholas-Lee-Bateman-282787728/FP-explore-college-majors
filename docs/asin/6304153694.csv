404579,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304153694,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","As a huge fan of Russell Crowe I had to research this movie and give it a try.  While it is not as polished a movie as it could have been it still brings an adequate amount of charm and heart and makes for a memorable and satisfying cinematic experience.Crowe stars as Lachlan, a fighter pilot in training who happens to fall in love with a married woman.  That woman is Lill, a lonely yet charming woman whose husband is away at war.  Lachlan and Lill's relationship is one kept secret from those around them for it is a forbidden love.  As the two of them come closer together, Lachlan's inevitable departure to war creeps up on them with stinging effect.`For the Moment' is not a film that I would consider masterful or brilliant.  There have been plenty of romantic war epics that have surpassed this without even really trying, but what `For the Moment' has going for it is, like I mentioned, pure charm and heart.  A pre-stardom Crowe is magnetic here.  While this is far from his more polished and mature roles it is one that shows quite gloriously that he's had the ability all along.  Christianne Hirt is marvelous as Lill, emoting loneliness and despair as well as a heightened desire and fire when she meets and falls for Lachlan.Director Aaron Kim Johnston keeps the focus on the budding love affair, so anyone looking for an action filled war film should look the other way.  This is not a war film in the literal sense but a film about the war of love and the fact that love takes innocent casualties at will.I'd recommend `For the Moment' to any fan of Crowe; anyone that wants to see where this action giant came from.  Unarguably Crowe has become one of our greatest and most respected working actors, but he didn't just fall from the sky; he has roots.  `For the Moment' is one of those roots.  It's well worth the money and the time and will prove satisfying to the audience.  It's superbly acted and wonderfully constructed.  No, it's not perfect and yes there are better films to occupy one's time but `For the Moment' has enough going for it to validate a watch through.",4,Crowe proved early on that he was destined to be a star...,1205712000,"03 17, 2008",2008,2092,"['huge', 'fan', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'had', 'research', 'movie', 'give', 'try', 'not', 'polished', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'still', 'adequate', 'amount', 'charm', 'heart', 'memorable', 'satisfying', 'cinematic', 'experience.Crowe', 'stars', 'Lachlan', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'training', 'who', 'fall', 'love', 'married', 'woman', 'woman', 'Lill', 'lonely', 'yet', 'charming', 'woman', 'husband', 'away', 'war', 'Lachlan', 'Lill', 'relationship', 'one', 'kept', 'secret', 'forbidden', 'love', 'two', 'come', 'closer', 'together', 'Lachlan', 'inevitable', 'departure', 'war', 'creeps', 'up', 'stinging', 'effect.', 'Moment', 'not', 'film', 'would', 'consider', 'masterful', 'brilliant', 'have', 'been', 'plenty', 'romantic', 'war', 'epics', 'have', 'surpassed', 'even', 'really', 'trying', 'what', 'Moment', 'going', 'mentioned', 'pure', 'charm', 'heart', 'pre-stardom', 'Crowe', 'magnetic', 'here', 'far', 'more', 'polished', 'mature', 'roles', 'one', 'quite', 'gloriously', 'had', 'ability', 'along', 'Christianne', 'Hirt', 'marvelous', 'Lill', 'emoting', 'loneliness', 'despair', 'as', 'well', 'heightened', 'desire', 'fire', 'when', 'Lachlan.Director', 'Aaron', 'Kim', 'Johnston', 'focus', 'budding', 'love', 'affair', 'anyone', 'looking', 'action', 'filled', 'war', 'film', 'should', 'look', 'other', 'way', 'not', 'war', 'film', 'literal', 'sense', 'film', 'war', 'love', 'fact', 'love', 'innocent', 'casualties', 'will.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Moment', 'fan', 'Crowe', 'anyone', 'see', 'where', 'action', 'giant', 'came', 'Unarguably', 'Crowe', 'become', 'one', 'greatest', 'most', 'respected', 'working', 'actors', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'fall', 'sky', 'roots', 'Moment', 'one', 'roots', 'well', 'money', 'time', 'will', 'prove', 'satisfying', 'audience', 'superbly', 'acted', 'wonderfully', 'constructed', 'No', 'not', 'perfect', 'yes', 'are', 'better', 'films', 'occupy', 'one', 'time', 'Moment', 'enough', 'going', 'validate', 'watch']",For the Moment VHS

A much younger Russell Crowe portrays an Australian pilot who is undergoing further training in Manitoba, Canada during WWII.  He eventually begins an affair with a woman whose husband has already departed for combat.  The relationship is likely doomed from the start.  Will Crowe's character even survive the war?  Most pilots are killed within months after their departure.  The people around these illicit lovers also have their own troubles.  Should everyone live for the immediate present?  Is there logical reason to invest in a long term future hopes?Russell Crowe is now one of our greatest film actors.  He doesn't get much of a chance to show his ability in this movie.

404585,A28YVF72KWOJ1X,6304153694,KENNY NG,"[1, 1]","This was how President Franklin Roosevelt described Canada, the seemingly perfect location to train Royal Air Force and Canadian Royal Air Force pilots in the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, a large and successful military pilot training program during World War Two.  Russell Crowe delivers an impressive performance as a young bomber pilot in training who woos a local married woman with his looks and charm.  As a war film buff, I do not really care for all the sentimentality (no matter how well acted) but I must praise this obscure low-budget Canadian film for bringing to light an important aspect of the Allied war effort which took place in quiet rural Manitoba.  This movie is set during the early years of WWII since it included a few American trainees, one of whom is an arrogant, rude and lecherous villian who is the opposite of Russell Crowe's mild-mannered Australian character.  Choosing an American to be the movie's villian seemed a bit contrived to me, but there was around 1759 Americans in the RAF who transferred to the US military when America finally entered the war.  When watching the movie, or just looking at the DVD cover, one will notice that the air force uniform has a much DARKER SHADE OF BLUE than the familiar RAF uniforms seen in ""Battle of Britain"".
