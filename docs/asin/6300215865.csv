219016,A2J5CQFCB11VKJ,6300215865,3rdGen,"[2, 2]","I love this movie for it's ""revenge"" story line, the good action, terrific acting, and beautiful scenery.  Most of the movie was filmed along the Eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada range in California, at Convict Lake, Owens Valley, Hot Creek.  Simply beautiful.One of my favorite parts of the movie is when Brian Keith befriends Max Sand (McQueen) and shows him how to shoot. The dialog between the two is classic:  McQueen>> ""I'm half white"".  Keith>>  ""And you're all helpless"".  What is rather strange is that McQueen is probably at least 35 years old in this movie. Yet he's referred to as  ""just a kid"". Karl Malden plays a terrific heavy. And he gets what he deserves. I imagine he had a tough time crawling out of Hot Creek after Nevada Smith did a number on him.The only part of this movie I didn't care for was the ""bayou prison"" section. It was a little too long and a little too slow for me. But, in spite of this, Nevada Smith is a terrific movie. The scenery is beautiful, the characters are interesting, the action is lively, and the story will keep your interest. I've watched it probably 6 or 8 times over the years, and it's still fun to watch. A remake came out in the 70's(?) and it is not good.

219033,A1YIYS3J7EQ3F8,6300215865,"C. Santas ""Constantine/film buff""","[1, 2]","Nevada Smith (1966)Directed by Henry Hathaway.A ""young"" Steven McQueen, in one of his better vehicles. The story of revenge is lengthy but it rewards your patience. McQueen plays a half-breed, Max Sand, whose parents are murdered by a gang of outlaws, led by Karl Malden, Arthur Kennedy and Martin Landau. He goes after them, but he is a plain country bumpkin who doesn't even know how to fire a gun--let alone track down and catch the three murderers. But he stumbles upon a gun trader (Brian Keith) who schools him in the art of shooting and looking cool when pursuing seasoned killers. He learns fast and uses all kinds of ruses before he gets too the pursuit of the villains. After a lengthy search he finds Landau in a saloon, and though the latter is an expert with the knife, he manages to kill him after a lengthy brawl. He imprisons himself doing hard labor in the Louisiana swamps after he has tracked down the Kennedy character, plans an escape, with the help of a local girl played by the late Susanne Pleshette, during which he kills him after the latter recognizes him. The last task, finding and killing Malden, requires unusual guile, but Sand is up to the task; he is been recruited by Malden himself for a bullion heist, isolates him, and shoots him in the hands and knees, immobilizing him but leaving him alive in the river, shouting at him--""Kill me! You are yellow!"" Sand throws the gun into the river, and leaves him there to die alone. That is his revenge.This is one of the strongest vehicles for McQueen, with a cluster of outstanding character actors building up an exciting, though slow-paced, climax. Max is in a moral quandary: He takes upon himself to be the pursuer--who learns on the job--the captor, the judge, and the executioner. It's a story of frontier justice--usually delivered by individuals, and not the law--which stays a secondary factor in the story. Max Sand has scuffles with the law, but his revenge is an individual act, not one that fulfils any moral law--or the justice system. When confronted by a priest living in the desert--Ralph Valone in a brilliant vignette--he brushes off his counsel of ""forgiveness,"" and makes a joke when the priest points to a statuette of the crucifixion who ""came to save mankind."" ""He must have missed some,"" cracks Sand in bitterness.As always, McQueen is super-cool, and a bit enigmatic. Nothing fazes him, nothing can stop him, but what does not know exactly what drives him. He is a world apart from the sadistic, casual killers that populate the Wild West--for the kill for greed and profit, with no regard whatsoever for human life, property, or one's rights. The villains are the blackest characters one sees in the typical western; they utterly lack moral consciousness. Sand refrains from killing anyone else except those that killed his parents. He possesses a moral code--one suited to McQueen persona to a tee. Undeterred, he proceeds until he succeeds. And when he finally has Malden where he wants him, wounded, and incapable of fighting back, he contemptuously refrains from finishing him off: ""You are not worth killing,"" he says, and tosses his gun into the river, only a few feet away, perhaps thinking that Malden could somehow reach the gun and kill himself. Tossing the gun is an ironic gesture, for it may imply that Valone's sermonizing may not have been in vain. ""An eye for an eye,"" is what collects from the Bible the priest gave him to read--but once this is accomplished, he wants no more blood.

Steve McQueen, whose character ages from green teenager to hardened criminal, subtlely suggests the toll of blood vengeance to one's person.  McQueen may have been a tad too old for the role but his expertise as an actor makes you suspend disbelief.  The film has a vast and impressive supporting cast.

To me, this was just a hip take on the western melodramas of the 50's. In the early scenes, McQueen could have helped cedibility a great bit by letting another actor play himself as an adolescent. I believe this was an early Harold Robbins novel and toned down into the lengthy story. As McQueen's character moves across the land in hunt of those responsible for killing his family, there are wonderful life-changing moments. Brian Keith's gun lore and rapport with McQueen is worth the whole viewing. Another mini-scene within this adventure is with the under-utilized, Suzanne Pleshette, in the swamplands of Louisiana. Love nearly conquered, slowing the story until McQueen catches up with Karl Malden and his thugs. Malden is strong in his scenes, but there is too much horseplay at the end that makes the revenge a bit silly and wrong-headed, since any red-blooded man would have run off with Pleshette anyway. Right when you want McQueen to kill the thugs, there's some nonsense with a Mission priest that slows the finish even more. Cut-up and shown on TV, it was a tighter, more fluid story. Like Malden's ""Left-handed Gun,"" the film is uneven and crawls in spots. We forgive this movie when the sum of the mini-scenes do not add up to a successful whole, for the fact that an editor did not do what was best. I don't even remember what revenge McQueen's character had at the end. 30 years later I watch the movie to see Pleshette, Keith and McQueen do what casts of 10 or so on TV sitcoms can never approach.Kudos for casting, thumbs down for pacing.",4,Choose to live over vengeance.,1146268800,"04 29, 2006",2006,1645,"['favorite', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'vehicle', 'sprawling', 'western', 'bit', 'too', 'far', 'was', 'just', 'hip', 'take', 'western', 'melodramas', '50', 'early', 'scenes', 'McQueen', 'could', 'have', 'helped', 'cedibility', 'great', 'bit', 'letting', 'actor', 'play', 'adolescent', 'believe', 'was', 'early', 'Harold', 'Robbins', 'novel', 'toned', 'down', 'lengthy', 'story', 'McQueen', 'character', 'moves', 'land', 'hunt', 'responsible', 'killing', 'family', 'are', 'wonderful', 'life-changing', 'moments', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'gun', 'lore', 'rapport', 'McQueen', 'whole', 'viewing', 'mini-scene', 'adventure', 'under-utilized', 'Suzanne', 'Pleshette', 'swamplands', 'Louisiana', 'Love', 'nearly', 'conquered', 'slowing', 'story', 'McQueen', 'up', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'thugs', 'Malden', 'strong', 'scenes', 'too', 'much', 'horseplay', 'end', 'revenge', 'bit', 'silly', 'wrong-headed', 'red-blooded', 'man', 'would', 'have', 'run', 'off', 'Pleshette', 'anyway', 'Right', 'when', 'want', 'McQueen', 'kill', 'thugs', 'nonsense', 'Mission', 'priest', 'finish', 'even', 'more', 'Cut-up', 'shown', 'TV', 'was', 'tighter', 'more', 'fluid', 'story', 'Malden', 'Left-handed', 'Gun', 'film', 'uneven', 'crawls', 'spots', 'forgive', 'movie', 'when', 'sum', 'mini-scenes', 'do', 'not', 'add', 'up', 'successful', 'whole', 'fact', 'editor', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'what', 'was', 'best', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'what', 'revenge', 'McQueen', 'character', 'had', 'end', '30', 'years', 'later', 'watch', 'movie', 'see', 'Pleshette', 'Keith', 'McQueen', 'do', 'what', '10', 'so', 'TV', 'sitcoms', 'can', 'never', 'approach.Kudos', 'casting', 'thumbs', 'down', 'pacing']",N/A

Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[1, 1]","This movie is based on a character from Harold Robbins' THE CARPETBAGGERS, but not to worry if you don't remember Nevada Smith as no one should be criticized for not remembering anything about that book. As I remember it was not the great American novel. I kept trying to figure out why the movie was so named since McQueen who is Nevada Smith doesn't take that name until near the end of the movie.Steve McQueen, who is cast as the son of a white man and American Indian, is by far the best thing about this movie. I know: Steve has light eyes and brown hair but none of the other characters in the movie know he is half Indian so it shouldn't bother us, I suppose.The plot is simple. Mcqueen sets out to kill the three men who have brutally murdered his parents. In practically every frame of this movie, he does a fine job of acting. Even though McQueen was 36 when this movie was released in 1966, he looks all of 20.

McQueen stars as Max Sand and we only learn at the end of the film why it's called NEVADA SMITH instead of MAX SAND. McQueen's parents have been brutally murdered and he is out for revenge. It's a stretch to believe he is half-native American and originally was meant to be a teenager but we can just go with the story.The fun part of NEVADA SMITH is seeing some famous actors in their younger days. Suzanne Pleshette is simply stunning as the sexy Pilar. Add Martin Landau, Karl Malden, Pat Hingle and Howard DaSilva and you have an amazing cast in a relatively mediocre film. McQueen plays his role with joy as he follows the separate paths of the three killers. He even heads east to New Orleans and intentionally lands in dismal penitentiary in the swamps just to be closer to one of the killers. Here is where the story gets stretched as he meets Pilar while in this swampy prison world. The movie is over two hours long and takes us across the US in Max's quest for revenge. Brian Keith from TV's FAMILY AFFAIR has a notable role as the traveling gun and ammo peddler who befriends Max and shows him the way of a gunfighter's world.The film is a bit of a disappointment but worth the time before of McQueen and the various classic actors.

The scene where Steve's character kills Martin's in a knifefight was probably shot in the dark in order to make it less clear that Martin really couldn't play such a scene convincingly. Strongest performances were by Karl Malden and the guy who played the last of the three villains, and the strongest scenes came during the last sequence set in the La. prison camp.  I liked Suzanne Pleschette as the Cajun; she turned in a solid performance notwithstanding that the script had her repeating a line that was good but lost its impact in the repetition (Then again, she may have failed to remember that correct line from the script and repeated the line as a good fit for the context.  If so, then [like the Keith stumble], the scene should have been edited.)Early scenes required Steve McQ to be a young man perhaps in his teens or young adulthood.  A viewer could see him trying, but failing, to project the naivete and spontaneity you would expect from a person that age.  Brian Keith too awkward and untextured to be a credible Western figure.  In one scene that should have been edited out, he stumbles over a rock and almost topples over.Too many gaps in continuity scene-to-scene.  The unifying storyline of Steve chasing the three drifters who killed his parents holds up but few scenes gave the viewer an explanation for how we get to the next scene.

Lovins ""Mr. Jim""","[2, 2]","Paramount Pictures  presents ""NEVADA SMITH"" (1966) (128 min/Color) -- Starring Steve McQueen, Karl Malden, Brian Keith, Arthur Kennedy, Martin Landau & Suzanne PleshetteDirected by Henry HathawaySet in the West of the 1890s, the film opens with the torture and murder of the parents of Max Sand (Steve McQueen) by a trio of gunslingers seemingly motivated by their hostility toward the mixed nature of the marriage (Max's mother is a Native American). Swearing revenge, the young cowhand enlists the help of itinerant gunsmith Jonas Cord Sr. (Brian Keith), who teaches him how to shoot while counseling against revenge.Nonetheless, Sand doggedly scours one town after the other before finally running up against one of the murderers, Jesse Coe (Martin Landau). He finally kills Coe in a vicious knife fight, but is severely wounded himself and has to be nursed back to health by Neesa (Janet Margolin), a young Kiowa woman.He next heads for Louisiana where another of the murderous trio, Bill Bowdre (Arthur Kennedy), is serving a prison sentence in a remote swamp. In order to get close to the man, Sand stages a robbery, and is soon among the prison inmates. Pilar (Suzanne Pleshette), a Cajun girl working in the rice fields near the convicts' camp, gives Max comfort and finds a craft to help him escape through the swamps. He takes Bowdre with him and murders him along the way, but the boat tips in the swamp and Pilar dies from a snake bite.Still blinded by revenge, Max goes after Tom Fitch (Karl Malden), the last of the murderers. He infiltrates Fitch's gang, calling himself ""Nevada Smith,"" but Fitch realizes that Max Sand is out there somewhere, trying to ambush him.Fabulous music score by Alfred Newman and cinematography by Lucien Ballard.Henry Hathaway's film is based on a character from Harold Robbins' ""The Carpetbaggers"", who, in turn, based it on cowboy actor Ken Maynard.To this extent Nevada Smith (1966) serves as a prequel to The Carpetbaggers (1964). In the latter film, the role of Nevada Smith was played by Alan Ladd as an aging cowboy turned western film star.Further complicating (though also linking the two films) is appearance of Jonas Cord Sr. (Brian Keith) in Nevada Smith (1966) - his son Jonas Cord takes front and center in ""The Carpetbaggers"" (1964) being played by George Peppard in a role described as ""a rancidly-sketched portrait of Howard Hughes!""BIOS:1.

The story is absolutely compelling as it has as involved a plot as just about any western ever filmed.  This movie will hold your interest from the beginning to end.  Director Henry Hathaway (""How the West Was Won"", ""Sons of Katie Elder"", ""True Grit"") holds this movie together brilliantly with crisp direction, pace, and eliciting acting performances on par with any classic film.

219079,AWHS1TFR7S1NL,6300215865,Michael A. Quebec,"[8, 8]","This was one of the very first westerns I ever saw as a kid, so it has a certain amount of nostalgia for me.The story is excellent &amp; McQueen portrays his morally ambiguous character, out for revenge against the men who murdered his parents, with sensitivity.  We see that he slowly becomes like the killers he's after, living only for vengeance, walking away from one potential love interest &amp; losing the respect of another while she dies from a snake-bite.  (This one was played by Suzanne Pleshette.)  We sympathize with him, but he's no hero.  He participates in robberies &amp; associates with killers in his quest, so in that sense, as another reviewer stated, this is the beginning of the &quot;modern western.&quot;Other reviewers, however, have also missed out on another intersting aspect of this film.  It's a pre-quel.  Most viewers don't realize this.  &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot;, written as a novel by Harrold Robbins &amp; released almost two years before &quot;Nevada Smith&quot; was a huge hit back in the '60's.  That film starred George Peppard as a millionaire tycoon &amp; Alan Ladd as his close friend &amp; mentor.  Peppard's character, &quot;Jonas Cord Jr.&quot;, is really a fictionalized Howard Hughes.  His father (and namesake) had gone insane &amp; Cord The 2nd lives in fear of turning out like his father.  So much so, that he becomes so ambitious in his quest for wealth, becoming both an aviation industrialist &amp; a film-producer (just like his real-life counterpart, Howard Hughes), that he turns away from any &amp; all real, meaningful relationships.  His best friend, Alan Ladd's character, saves &quot;Cord&quot; from himself, by making him face what he's become.  This character, portrayed by Alan Ladd, is a cowboy/western film-star during the early days of Hollywood &amp; is a top billing star in &quot;Cord's&quot; (Peppard's) movie-studio.  He knows how a single-minded obsession can destroy ones' humanity because he himself had gone through it as a young man, growing up in the Wild West.....You guessed it.  Alan Ladd's character is &quot;Nevada Smith&quot;, the very same character portrayed by Steve McQueen in the movie of the same name.  If you watch &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot; &amp; &quot;Nevada Smith&quot;, then you can really enjoy the characters more, seeing their backgrounds &amp; how they came to be.  In &quot;Nevada Smith&quot; it is Jonas Cord (Sr.) (portrayed by Brian Keith) who teaches McQueen's character how to fight.  This relationship gives us the reason why the Alan Ladd character (&quot;Nevada Smith&quot; as an old man) is so devoted to Peppard's Jonas Cord Jr.  It also shows how relationships &amp; behaviors repeat themselves.Both movies are classics.  Both movies are also somewhat dated (&quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot; could be re-done today &amp; improved upon, as a mini-series on tv while &quot;Nevada Smith&quot;, though excellent, does contain some historical innaccuracies which today's westerns would never allow), but the writing, the characters, the direction, &amp; the acting in both films are still good enough to hold up to today's audiences.",4,A Personal Favorite...And It's a Pre-quel!,1021161600,"05 12, 2002",2002,3148,"['was', 'one', 'very', 'first', 'westerns', 'ever', 'saw', 'kid', 'certain', 'amount', 'nostalgia', 'me.The', 'story', 'excellent', 'amp', 'McQueen', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'character', 'revenge', 'men', 'who', 'murdered', 'parents', 'sensitivity', 'see', 'slowly', 'killers', 'living', 'only', 'vengeance', 'walking', 'away', 'one', 'potential', 'love', 'interest', 'amp', 'losing', 'respect', 'snake-bite', 'one', 'was', 'played', 'Suzanne', 'Pleshette', 'sympathize', 'hero', 'robberies', 'amp', 'associates', 'killers', 'quest', 'so', 'sense', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'beginning', 'quot', 'modern', 'western.', 'quot', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'however', 'have', 'also', 'missed', 'out', 'intersting', 'aspect', 'film', 'pre-quel', 'Most', 'viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'quot', 'Carpetbaggers', 'quot', 'written', 'novel', 'Harrold', 'Robbins', 'amp', 'released', 'almost', 'two', 'years', 'quot', 'Nevada', 'Smith', 'quot', 'was', 'huge', 'hit', 'back', ""'60"", 'film', 'starred', 'George', 'Peppard', 'millionaire', 'tycoon', 'amp', 'Alan', 'Ladd', 'close', 'friend', 'amp', 'mentor', 'Peppard', 'character', 'quot', 'Jonas', 'Cord', 'Jr.', 'quot', 'really', 'fictionalized', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'father', 'namesake', 'had', 'gone', 'insane', 'amp', 'Cord', '2nd', 'lives', 'fear', 'turning', 'out', 'father', 'So', 'much', 'so', 'ambitious', 'quest', 'wealth', 'becoming', 'aviation', 'industrialist', 'amp', 'film-producer', 'just', 'real-life', 'counterpart', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'away', 'amp', 'real', 'meaningful', 'relationships', 'best', 'friend', 'Alan', 'Ladd', 'character', 'quot', 'Cord', 'quot', 'making', 'face', 'what', 'become', 'character', 'portrayed', 'Alan', 'Ladd', 'cowboy/western', 'film-star', 'early', 'days', 'Hollywood', 'amp', 'top', 'billing', 'star', 'quot', 'Cord', 'quot', 'Peppard', 'movie-studio', 'how', 'single-minded', 'obsession', 'can', 'destroy', 'ones', 'humanity', 'had', 'gone', 'young', 'man', 'growing', 'up', 'Wild', 'West', '..You', 'guessed', 'Alan', 'Ladd', 'character', 'quot', 'Nevada', 'Smith', 'quot', 'very', 'same', 'character', 'portrayed', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'movie', 'same', 'name', 'watch', 'quot', 'Carpetbaggers', 'quot', 'amp', 'quot', 'Nevada', 'Smith', 'quot', 'then', 'can', 'really', 'enjoy', 'characters', 'more', 'seeing', 'backgrounds', 'amp', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'quot', 'Nevada', 'Smith', 'quot', 'Jonas', 'Cord', 'Sr.', 'portrayed', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'who', 'McQueen', 'character', 'how', 'fight', 'relationship', 'reason', 'why', 'Alan', 'Ladd', 'character', 'quot', 'Nevada', 'Smith', 'quot', 'old', 'man', 'so', 'devoted', 'Peppard', 'Jonas', 'Cord', 'Jr', 'also', 'how', 'relationships', 'amp', 'behaviors', 'repeat', 'themselves.Both', 'movies', 'are', 'classics', 'movies', 'are', 'also', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'quot', 'Carpetbaggers', 'quot', 'could', 'be', 're-done', 'today', 'amp', 'improved', 'upon', 'mini-series', 'tv', 'quot', 'Nevada', 'Smith', 'quot', 'excellent', 'contain', 'historical', 'innaccuracies', 'today', 'westerns', 'would', 'never', 'allow', 'writing', 'characters', 'direction', 'amp', 'acting', 'films', 'are', 'still', 'good', 'enough', 'hold', 'up', 'today', 'audiences']",N/A

219090,AYKIGQ5L8MGL5,6300215865,"Raymond E. Parker ""Raymond Parker 'Actor,Writ...","[10, 10]","Nevada Smith was made at the heights of McQueen's short, but terrific career. This film, along with Love With The Proper Stranger, The Thomas Crown Affair, The Cincinnati Kid and Bullitt, proves just why McQueen was a star.Although the film is your average revenge-story, McQueen's performance along with Karl Malden, Martin Landau, Brian Keith and Susanne Pleshette, make it worth watching. McQueen stars as a young man (the script mentions that he's a boy and half-Indian, but so what?)who witnesess his parents' murder at the hands of Karl Malden's blood-thirsty gang. From there he goes on a year's long quest to hunt down each and every one of the killers, until his parents' death is avenged. He even goes so far as to land himself in a Louisianan chain gang to get one of them. What makes this movie stand out from other films in this genre, is McQueen's maturation during this process. He goes from young boy, to seasoned, cool killer by the time he reaches Karl Malden. McQueen, known for extensively underplaying a scene, gives away all kinds of subtlelties that most people missed (indeed this is why some in Hollywood didn't consider him a good actor), but that upon closer inspection one would see that he's ""in character"" every step of the way. The scene when he's in the swamp with one of his parents' killers and Susann Pleshette is chilling, because you see all of his rage at finally finding this man and exacting his revenge. What is more poignant is when he, at long last, has Karl Malden, and instead of killing him, leaves him there to die. You see in McQueen's eyes all of the pain, and sorrow, at his parents' loss, but you also see the pity that he has for this weak, pathetic man who is nothing without a gun on his belt. McQueen simply looks at the man, shrugs and walks away. In the hands of another actor this scene would've been overplayed to the point of melodrama, but McQueen said everything that needed to be said in a few simple gestures.

He was like a dog with a bone and was not going to stop until he had avenged both of his parent's slaughter.  And that is exactly what I mean because what was done to them was in humane!  He was a man with a purpose and in the end he realized it was not worth it.  I will not give the plot away but the extremes he went to bordered on the obsessive.  That did make it all the more interesting to see him go from strength to strength as he matured and aged.  When I first saw this in 1966 I thought it was good and I still think so.  I have been a Steve McQueen fan since Wanted: Dead or Alive was on.  I was 7 years old and watched him every Saturday night at 8:30!

The little known 'From Hell to Texas' is quoted by those who have seen it as Hathaway's best Western on these three counts, a film directed with profound feeling for the deliberate pace and loneliness of the real West...'Nevada Smith' is actually a strong and revealing study of the regeneration of one man... The film makes an excellent double bill with Marlon Brando's sole effort as director, 'One-Eyed Jacks.''Nevada Smith' is an exciting premise, taught and tight... It is not a motion picture to dismiss or forget... It is one of the first films to apply the contemporary standards of sex and violence to an Old West setting... The film is based on a story by John Michael Hayes, two-time Academy Award nominated screenwriter for 'Rear Window,' and 'Peyton Place.'The film lingers in the mind because of its visual beauty and the intensity of some of its scenes, particularly between McQueen and Malden, two knowing actors playing together with the skill of champion chess players...Hathaway sets up his atmosphere of dramatic tension right at the start... With a horse, a rifle, and 8 dollars, McQueen is a half-white teen-aged whose only desire is to hunt down his parents vicious killers... All helpless, he vows to dispatch the three 'bravados' one by one... He even gets himself thrown into prison just to gun one of them down...With the help of a gun merchant (Brian Keith), McQueen learns how to shoot a gun and sets out the chase where the money is... He rides off alone, blinded by a compulsion that obscures his other motive for living: 'I don't see nothing, except my father laying on a covered-floor all burnt and cut with the top of his head blown to pieces, and my mother split up in the middle and every square inch of her skin ripped off.'Steve McQueen recreates the type of role he had played in 'Wanted: Dead or Alive.' He is effective in his hesitant, self-conscious way, eager to be a firm gunfighter and almost as inept... He has little more sense of character than Ladd in Edward Dmytryk's 'The Carpetbaggers' but has a tension which made the film interesting to watch...Brian Keith is excellent as the father figure who adopts McQueen... He is sincere in warning the young avenger that in order to catch and kill these men, he will have to comb out every saloon, gambling hall, hog farm and whorehouse, and become just as despicable as they are... Keith comes out a star with his quiet, sure, graceful underplaying... As he instructs McQueen, it was clear that he knows not only his guns but human nature..Suzanne Pleshette, standing knee deep in water, is the pretty girl, able to escape from the terrors of her environment into the poetry of her reveries... Both a sinner and a saint, Pilar adds humanity to Max world...With a knife in his hand, and a scar on his neck, Martin Landau is the psychotic womanizer, a morose, evil character, caught in Abelene dealing cards in a saloon...Arthur Kennedy - friendly, smiling, charming and smooth-talking on the surface, weak and corrupt underneath - is the frightened villain swamped by a storm of revenge...Karl Malden is the cynical badman who depreciates his gold before his executioner...Raf Vallone is the good priest who wants his young avenging hunter to take a deep look into his heart...Pat Hingle is the prisoner in custody with gun and whip, who takes great pleasure and delight in breaking his companions by beating them up...Howard da Silva is the ruthless warden who assures his prisoners that the swamp is their wall... Miles and miles of it, filled of dirty water, quicksand, razorbacks, poison snakes, mosquitoes and malaria...Janet Margolin is the dance hall girl uncertain of the identity of one of the dangerous murderers...Joanna Cook Moore is the grateful saloon girl who offers herself to Max...Rick Roman is Cipriano, the bandit who warns seriously his companion not to harm Father Zaccardi...Ted de Corsia is the bartender who wants the two contenders to calm down in order to find out the truth..The expertise before the cameras and behind it, plus McQueen's dynamic presence, makes 'Nevada Smith' a

219098,AK61LQI92GTCH,6300215865,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[99, 103]","If you're ever curious why people made such a fuss about Steve McQueen check out NEVADA SMITH, Henry Hathaway's sprawling tale of vengeance and obsession.McQueen plays young half-Indian/half-white Max Sand, whose parents are murdered by a trio of bandits (Martin Landau, Arthur Kennedy, Karl Malden.)  McQueen was 36 years old in 1966, the year NEVADA SMITH was made, and was probably a decade past the time when he could effortlessly portray a nave young hero.  There's a brief, disturbingly violent scene at the beginning of the movie where the three villains are torturing Smith's parents, and the woman portraying McQueen's Kiowa mother doesn't look much older than 35.  Still, McQueen brings a wide-eyed innocence to his performance that tremendously helps us suspend disbelief.  Besides, I believe I counted exactly zero close-ups in this action western.  If you want to check out the crow's feet around McQueen's eyes you'll have to look hard and fast to see them.McQueen gets a chance to play against some Hollywood professionals at the top of their games.  Brian Keith is growlingly good as traveling gunsmith Jonas Cord, who plays Polonius to McQueen's Laertes, and plies the young stranger with instruction and advice.  Max Sand won't be argued out of his mission to avenge the death of his parents, and the pragmatic Cord reluctantly agrees to be his mentor.  It's through Cord and, later, a priest Sand comes across, that the movie is allowed to question its central theme - vengeance.  Cord argues the practical (""You'll turn into one of the rats you're hunting,"") the priest the spiritual.  It's a tribute to the brilliance of McQueen's performance that by the time we reach the last scene we can see how both arguments have contributed to his maturation.  Karl Malden plays the evil, racist Tom Fitch with sadist gusto.  Malden overacts a bit in one of those rare roles that benefits when an actor takes it over the top.  Watching the suspicious Fitch interrogate the no-longer-nave Max Sand is one of the highlights of the movie.The underrated Hathaway shot most of NEVADA SMITH on location, and the realistic look is used to great advantage.  He doesn't go for the landmark shots a la John Ford in Monument Valley, choosing instead to play scenes in anonymous swamps and deserts.  The realism shoots through all the way to stunts and props and costumes.  Instead of elaborately choreographed fist fights with exaggerated sound effects every time a blow is struck, the characters in NEVADA SMITH scratch and claw, bite and kick when they fight.  The clothes they wear are torn and dirty and they stay dirty.NEVADA SMITH has enough going for it to appeal to those who aren't typically fans of westerns.

Beautiful scenery throughout ranging from the mountains of the Northwest to the swamps of Louisiana with a good musical score to back up the story.  Brian Keith is exceptional in his role as McQueen's mentor.  This is classic McQueen.  The anger he feels for these three men is obvious as he chases them around the country, even working alongside them so that he can be around in case he gets a chance to exact his revenge.
