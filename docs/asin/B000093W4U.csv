I've never seen the dark side of female friendships represented so well. Michelle Williams is Holly, ""the sweetest girl in all the world."" She is an intelligent, shy, overlooked beauty. Her best friend's brother (Oliver Milburn), is absolutely captivating and charming. If you don't fall in love with this movie, you'll fall in love with him.

751645,A1W5J6ATHGRS71,B000093W4U,"C. Miller ""Knitter and bookworm""","[0, 0]","This small, understated film explores the agony and ecstasy of being a friend, tracking the relationship between two British girls, Marina (Anna Friel) and Holly (Michelle Williams of &quot;Dawson's Creek&quot; fame), as they find their way through the 70's and 80's.  It is an unflinching, non-moralizing account of two people who grow up and grow apart but who can't let each other go.Early on, Holly's mother says, &quot;There are pretty people, and there are clever people,&quot; and it's clear that while Marina falls into the pretty category, Holly thinks the only thing she can be is clever.  Marina's glamourous, party girl behavior belies her deep insecurities and neediness, which also prompt her passive-aggressive behavior toward Holly, all attempts to maintain control of a friend who needs nothing more than to break away from her.  Holly also carries a torch for Marina's brother Nat (Oliver Milburn) who admits the feeling is mutual, but the timing is never right.  It's clear that while the girls were inseparable as children, as young adults, Holly develops a personality and individuality all her own while Marina can't separate her identity from her friend.The film drags in sections and often beats you over the head with the points it attempts to make, but all in all it is an enjoyable little movie.  Williams handles the English accent remarkably well and shows that she is probably the most gifted of the actors to emerge from &quot;Dawson's Creek.&quot;  Friel may get the fireworks, but as Holly, Williams ultimately gets the more interesting character.  It is also amusing to witness the changes in fashion and music as the characters go from 1973 to 2001.It may not be the most original subject matter, but anyone who's ever had a friend would find it difficult not to relate to this film.",4,not-so-joyous paean to female friendship,1078185600,"03 2, 2004",2004,1818,"['small', 'understated', 'film', 'agony', 'ecstasy', 'being', 'friend', 'tracking', 'relationship', 'two', 'British', 'girls', 'Marina', 'Anna', 'Friel', 'Holly', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'quot', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'quot', 'fame', 'find', 'way', '70', '80', 'unflinching', 'non-moralizing', 'account', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'grow', 'up', 'grow', 'apart', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'other', 'go.Early', 'Holly', 'mother', 'quot', 'are', 'pretty', 'people', 'are', 'clever', 'people', 'quot', 'clear', 'Marina', 'pretty', 'category', 'Holly', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'clever', 'Marina', 'glamourous', 'party', 'girl', 'behavior', 'deep', 'insecurities', 'neediness', 'also', 'passive-aggressive', 'behavior', 'Holly', 'attempts', 'maintain', 'control', 'friend', 'who', 'nothing', 'more', 'break', 'away', 'Holly', 'also', 'torch', 'Marina', 'brother', 'Nat', 'Oliver', 'Milburn', 'who', 'feeling', 'mutual', 'timing', 'never', 'right', 'clear', 'girls', 'were', 'inseparable', 'children', 'young', 'adults', 'Holly', 'personality', 'individuality', 'own', 'while', 'Marina', 'ca', ""n't"", 'separate', 'identity', 'friend.The', 'film', 'drags', 'sections', 'often', 'head', 'points', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'little', 'movie', 'Williams', 'English', 'accent', 'remarkably', 'well', 'probably', 'most', 'gifted', 'actors', 'emerge', 'quot', 'Dawson', 'Creek.', 'quot', 'Friel', 'may', 'get', 'fireworks', 'Holly', 'Williams', 'ultimately', 'more', 'interesting', 'character', 'also', 'amusing', 'witness', 'changes', 'fashion', 'music', 'characters', 'go', '1973', '2001.It', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'original', 'subject', 'matter', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'had', 'friend', 'would', 'find', 'difficult', 'not', 'relate', 'film']",Me Without You

751647,A3MYY88NLEJ8Y3,B000093W4U,Diane Moore,"[2, 2]","I found that this movie was very true to life. How many times do I remember wanting my best female friend to go away but stay beside me forever? That's the phenomenon about it. Sometimes, there seems to be a very strong, mysterious bond between women. It's like: no matter what happens, you can come back together and fix whatever went wrong. (This review has a couple of spoilers: don't read if you haven't seen the movie.)That's how I felt watching this movie. It showed the years go by for Marina and Holly (they constantly referred to themselves as Harina) to show that they were ""one."" It started out when they were young girls and followed them through their 20's.At the beginning, you see that Marina is the ""wild"" one and Holly is the more practical, ""good"" girl. Troubles start to happen when the girls reach their teenage years. All along, Holly has had a crush on Marina's brother Nat, and it seems that he feels the same way about her. (SPOILER) Unfortunately, Marina seems to do everything in her power to keep the two of them away from each other, including: ripping up a letter for Holly from her brother the day after Holly and Nat had sex.Time goes on, and they move into their 20's. People start to realize that they are very connected to each other, but to some, it seems a bit unhealthy. (Another SPOILER) They both get involved with their tutor, played by Kyle Machlachlan, and when each one finds out about the other, it temporarily ruins their friendship. (This is why you should not let men come between two women! It never works!) Anyway...Towards the end, we find that Marina needs Holly a lot more than Holly needs Marina. She tends to feel suffocated by Marina, who claims.. ""There is no me without you."" (Hopefully, I got the quote right.) It all feels very dramatic, beautiful, and horrible at the same time, because you feel for this girl that has no identity without her best friend.I really enjoyed this movie and I thought that Michelle Williams's accent was great! It felt like she worked a LOT with the dialogue coach to get it just right. The chemistry worked for all of the characters. The only reason I gave it four stars and not five, was because I would have liked to see Holly come out and face Marina about her manipulative nature and about the fact that she was keeping her away from Nat for so long. Maybe that's not important to others, but if someone was lying to me and being so cunning, I would have a hard time staying such good friends. Also, I think that it ended too easily, like a neatly tied bow, although very sweet. It made me feel sentimental and miss my female friends terribly!

The movie focuses on their friendship from when they are children to their teen years and as adults depicting their different personalities and the men that come and go into their lives.

Their relationship takes a pivotal turn in Holly is engaged to be married and is expecting.Friendships take time to build and can take a matter of seconds to be destroyed.  In this movie, Holly and Marina, two different individuals remain strong ties despite their ups and downs and backgrounds.

""Me Without You"" would not be one of those films, because you repeatedly have to wonder when you are watching this 2001 film whether Holly (Michelle Williams) and Marina (Anna Friel) really like each other.  The two girls grew up living next door to each other in London in the early 1970s, and when they were young, dressing up and bouncing on their beds, they make a pact of eternal friendship.  It seems clear this is a mistake, because Holly is the smart one but follows the lead of the dominating Marina, but there is nothing the two can do about it because their lives are so completely intertwined that a trauma for one invariable involves the other as they grow up and move on into the 1980s.""Me Without You"" is directed by Sandra Goldbacher from a script by Goldbacher and Laurence Coriat, and I wonder what personal demons they are exorcising here because the pain and regret rings so true.  I also find myself considering this film to be the anti-""Beaches.""  There you had two young girls who form a friendship because of a chance meeting and who keep in touch over the years, especially during the key moments in their life.  Her you have two young girls who form a friendship because they live next door and they have nobody else in their lives.  They live together as often as not and are in each other's lives almost constantly, so that every time they fall in love the other seems to be some sort of impediment to living happily ever after.  We jump from year to year, with attention paid to what Holly and Marina wear along with the music they listen to, and the question is whether the two will be able to survive their friendship.You can pick your moment where this friendship clearly becomes dysfunctional and a bad thing rather than a good thing, but I think the die is cast when Holly finally sleeps with Marina's brother Nat (Oliver Miburn).  She has had a crush on him since the beginning, but Marina sees this as some sort of betrayal, and from then on Holly is the sympathetic figure in this story, although to some extent she wins that position by default.  The division between the two friends becomes starker when they both end up in the bed of Daniel (Kyle MacLachlan), an American lecturing at their college.  The both want to sleep with Daniel and he obliges them both, and then is thoroughly befuddled when it turns out the two young women are closer than the thought.  For Marina the relationship seems to be nothing more than another competition with Holly, while for Holly the truth takes away all of the joy of an important personal epiphany.I was not sure why Michelle Williams was adopting a Brit accent to do this film, but she was the reason I checked out this film, not just because I saw a shot of the seaweed scene.  To date in terms of ""Dawson's Creek"" alumni, Williams might be the forgotten one because she does not get big films but she is putting together a solid resume with films like ""Prozac Nation"" and ""If These Walls Can Talk 2.""  The important thing here is that if Williams's name is enough to get people to see this movie with its almost brutally realistic depiction of friendship between two young women, then so much the better.  ""Me Without You"" is not an uplifting film, but given its honesty it certainly is a refreshing one.",4,"Friendships are necessary, but sometimes they are not a good thing",1125532800,"09 1, 2005",2005,3406,"['Friendship', 'important', 'thing', 'living', 'are', 'plenty', 'films', 'tell', 'stories', 'great', 'friendships', 'Me', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'films', 'repeatedly', 'have', 'wonder', 'when', 'are', 'watching', '2001', 'film', 'Holly', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Marina', 'Anna', 'Friel', 'really', 'other', 'two', 'girls', 'grew', 'up', 'living', 'next', 'door', 'other', 'London', 'early', '1970s', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'dressing', 'up', 'bouncing', 'beds', 'make', 'pact', 'eternal', 'friendship', 'clear', 'mistake', 'Holly', 'smart', 'one', 'lead', 'dominating', 'Marina', 'nothing', 'two', 'can', 'do', 'lives', 'are', 'so', 'completely', 'intertwined', 'trauma', 'one', 'invariable', 'other', 'grow', 'up', 'move', '1980s', 'Me', 'directed', 'Sandra', 'Goldbacher', 'script', 'Goldbacher', 'Laurence', 'Coriat', 'wonder', 'what', 'personal', 'demons', 'are', 'exorcising', 'here', 'pain', 'regret', 'rings', 'so', 'true', 'also', 'find', 'considering', 'film', 'be', 'anti-', 'Beaches', 'had', 'two', 'young', 'girls', 'who', 'form', 'friendship', 'chance', 'meeting', 'who', 'keep', 'touch', 'years', 'especially', 'key', 'moments', 'life', 'have', 'two', 'young', 'girls', 'who', 'form', 'friendship', 'live', 'next', 'door', 'have', 'nobody', 'else', 'lives', 'live', 'together', 'as', 'often', 'not', 'are', 'other', 'lives', 'almost', 'constantly', 'time', 'fall', 'love', 'other', 'be', 'sort', 'impediment', 'living', 'happily', 'ever', 'jump', 'year', 'year', 'attention', 'paid', 'what', 'Holly', 'Marina', 'wear', 'music', 'listen', 'question', 'two', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'survive', 'friendship.You', 'can', 'pick', 'moment', 'where', 'clearly', 'becomes', 'dysfunctional', 'bad', 'thing', 'rather', 'good', 'thing', 'think', 'die', 'cast', 'when', 'Holly', 'finally', 'Marina', 'brother', 'Nat', 'Oliver', 'Miburn', 'had', 'crush', 'beginning', 'Marina', 'sort', 'betrayal', 'then', 'Holly', 'sympathetic', 'figure', 'story', 'extent', 'position', 'default', 'division', 'two', 'friends', 'starker', 'when', 'end', 'up', 'bed', 'Daniel', 'Kyle', 'MacLachlan', 'American', 'lecturing', 'college', 'want', 'sleep', 'Daniel', 'then', 'thoroughly', 'befuddled', 'when', 'out', 'two', 'young', 'women', 'are', 'closer', 'thought', 'Marina', 'relationship', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'competition', 'Holly', 'Holly', 'truth', 'away', 'joy', 'important', 'personal', 'epiphany.I', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'was', 'adopting', 'Brit', 'accent', 'do', 'film', 'was', 'reason', 'checked', 'out', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'saw', 'shot', 'seaweed', 'scene', 'date', 'terms', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'alumni', 'Williams', 'might', 'be', 'forgotten', 'one', 'not', 'get', 'big', 'films', 'putting', 'together', 'solid', 'resume', 'films', 'Prozac', 'Nation', 'Walls', 'Can', 'Talk', '2', 'important', 'thing', 'here', 'Williams', 'name', 'enough', 'get', 'people', 'see', 'movie', 'almost', 'brutally', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'friendship', 'two', 'young', 'women', 'then', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Me', 'not', 'uplifting', 'film', 'given', 'honesty', 'certainly', 'refreshing', 'one']",Me Without You

The script by Goldbacher and Laurence Coriat paints Marina as spiteful from puberty on, her deceptions growing more vicious and unbelievable as the picture moves from the pair's 1970s girlhood into young adulthood. Goldbacher is adept at visual storytelling, capturing intimate moments with breathtaking acuity. She's also got a couple of spirited actresses in her corner.Williams drops her ""Dawson's Creek"" persona immediately, mastering a middle-class English accent and kindly, mousy demeanor. The actress' manner fits a girl whose mother has told her, by way of comfort, ""Some girls are pretty, and some are smart."" Her performance is touching, heartfelt, and certainly eye-opening. She is truly an underrated actress.Friel wonderfully conveys her sadistic character's tortured bond to her friend. She turns a scene where Marina tells Holly, ""There's no me without you,"" into something poignant instead of overwrought. Her performance is powerful, emotional, and beautiful.Kyle MacLachlan (""Sex and the City"") makes an insinuating weasel as a professor who sparks romantic hopes in both young women. As Marina's cocktail- swilling mother, Trudie Styler (Sting's wife) cuts a glamorously wasted figure, the kind of woman who's great fun as your friend's mother and a nightmare as your own.Much of ""Me Without You"" strikes a familiar chord and intelligently captures the difficulties that can disrupt even a close friendship. Goldbacher often spins her story against the backdrop of 1970s British pop records, including The Clash, Adam Ant and Depeche Mode. It's a wonderfully entertaining film that is true to life and gut-wrenchingly real. A wonderful little gem that deserves to be seen.",4,Clever and Powerful.

But as they grow older, the nature of their relationship changes for the worse. Although Marina (Anna Friel) is an outgoing party girl, she seems unable to find an identity of her own and instead relies on the smarter and more introverted Holly (Michele Williams) to provide her with one. Holly is in love with Marina's brother Nat (Oliver Milburn), but Marina's jealousy has always come between them. Holly can hardly have a relationship with any man before Marina claims him for herself, leaving Holly heartbroken. After college, Holly pursues a writing career and Marina seems to make a career of forcing herself into Holly's relationships. For some reason, although she blames Marina for her misery, Holly allows Marina to turn her life upside down.""Me Without You"" is an especially true-to-life character drama. Marina and Holly are both interesting people, and each is sympathetic in her own way. The film's characters, their actions, and their feelings are all believable. Anna Friel and Michele Williams are exceptionally effective in their roles. It turns out that Michele Williams, probably best known for her teen roles in ""Dick"" and in television's ""Dawson's Creek"", is a very fine actress. Kyle MacLachlan has a small role as Daniel, one of Holly's and Marina's love interests. A story about a childhood bond that gets out of hand and becomes a co-dependent relationship of disastrous proportions sounds like it might be either a colossal bore or a horror flick. ""Me Without You"" is neither.
