He wasn't as dapper as Christopher Reeve but George Reeves was the first and foremost Superman. To us teens back then, he looked old and bulky (not sualve as they do today), but that was the way the male actors in the movies were for the most part then. All the kids looked up to our Superman as presented on our home t.v. sets. This kinky film shows the sordid backstage life of a mortal man who had no other roles (he tried in a Sinatra movie and bombed), because of his involvement with a married woman. Her husband even bought him a nice home for $12,000 which he considered a good investment as he had his own foreign paramour living in his mansion. He wanted to keep the little wife happy.It's just pretend, making shows on television and movies for the big screen. Being directed by the person who did 'Sin in the Big City,' that is the sordid way the Superman icon is presented. Well, he was just plain marvelous as Clark Kent, but his personal identity was humiliating to him and he wanted other things besides being a t.v. performer. She wanted him as he was and refused to help him further a film career. Thus, when he found a younger woman and fell in love, she set out on a murderous path of revenge.There were perplexing endings so you can take your pick as to who actually killed him in his own house, or if he did indeed kill himself. I always believed you every time, he'd told her; I had no idea I could spread so much joy. There was much more going on that you realize, and the guys were all frauds. Nothing was as it seemed. Before he met his demise, he told her, ""You owe me an explanation,"" which he never got. All he got was a fatal shot in the head. It was depressing. One woman commented to me on the way out, that it was well-done. I repleid that I would have to think about it.Actually, two stories were woven into one: the ill-mannered investigator played by Sean Penn with his sordid life and that of the major characters which made the movie rambling and disjointed. How's that? Why's that? A good biography of the first Superman on the screen, someone we all admired, was not in this movie. Instead it was like 'Sin in the City' in the Hollywood of the Fifties. No wonder Eddie went wrong, as he believed in that stuff. It was all make-believe and dangerous.You can skip this one and watch it on late-nite t.v. in the near future. There is not much redeeming value in watching one of your heroes sullied in this manner. Even if he was only a man, not a Superman, in person. He had the right to live out his life, but that one married woman felt differently. She is the villain even if she didn't pull the trigger. It's possible she did it in person, but with this story as presented here, we will always have to wonder.",3,The Real Superman from T.V.,1157846400,"09 10, 2006",2006,3029,"['way', 'was', 'featured', 'new', 'version', 'First', 'Superman', 'Nation', 'Loved.', 'September', '10', '2006Reviewer', 'Betty', 'Burks', 'Knoxville', 'TN', 'See', 'reviewsIn', 'Fifties', 'had', 'real', 'Superman', 'someone', 'who', 'fought', 'Truth', 'Justice', 'American', 'Way', 'television', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'dapper', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'George', 'Reeves', 'was', 'first', 'foremost', 'Superman', 'teens', 'back', 'then', 'looked', 'old', 'bulky', 'not', 'sualve', 'do', 'today', 'was', 'way', 'male', 'actors', 'movies', 'were', 'most', 'part', 'then', 'kids', 'looked', 'up', 'Superman', 'presented', 'home', 't.v', 'sets', 'kinky', 'film', 'sordid', 'backstage', 'life', 'mortal', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'other', 'roles', 'tried', 'Sinatra', 'movie', 'bombed', 'involvement', 'married', 'woman', 'husband', 'even', 'bought', 'nice', 'home', '12,000', 'considered', 'good', 'investment', 'had', 'own', 'foreign', 'paramour', 'living', 'mansion', 'wanted', 'keep', 'little', 'wife', 'happy.It', 'just', 'pretend', 'making', 'shows', 'television', 'movies', 'big', 'screen', 'Being', 'directed', 'person', 'who', 'did', ""'Sin"", 'Big', 'City', 'sordid', 'way', 'Superman', 'icon', 'presented', 'Well', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'marvelous', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'personal', 'identity', 'was', 'humiliating', 'wanted', 'other', 'things', 'being', 't.v', 'performer', 'wanted', 'was', 'refused', 'help', 'further', 'film', 'career', 'Thus', 'when', 'found', 'younger', 'woman', 'fell', 'love', 'set', 'out', 'murderous', 'path', 'revenge.There', 'were', 'perplexing', 'endings', 'can', 'take', 'pick', 'who', 'actually', 'killed', 'own', 'house', 'did', 'indeed', 'kill', 'always', 'believed', 'time', ""'d"", 'told', 'had', 'idea', 'could', 'spread', 'so', 'much', 'joy', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'going', 'realize', 'guys', 'were', 'frauds', 'Nothing', 'was', 'seemed', 'met', 'demise', 'told', 'owe', 'explanation', 'never', 'got', 'got', 'was', 'fatal', 'shot', 'head', 'was', 'depressing', 'One', 'woman', 'commented', 'way', 'was', 'well-done', 'repleid', 'would', 'have', 'think', 'it.Actually', 'two', 'stories', 'were', 'woven', 'one', 'ill-mannered', 'investigator', 'played', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'sordid', 'life', 'major', 'characters', 'made', 'movie', 'rambling', 'disjointed', 'How', 'Why', 'good', 'biography', 'first', 'Superman', 'screen', 'someone', 'admired', 'was', 'not', 'movie', 'Instead', 'was', 'like', ""'Sin"", 'City', 'Hollywood', 'Fifties', 'wonder', 'Eddie', 'went', 'wrong', 'believed', 'stuff', 'was', 'make-believe', 'dangerous.You', 'can', 'skip', 'one', 'watch', 'late-nite', 't.v', 'near', 'future', 'not', 'much', 'redeeming', 'value', 'watching', 'one', 'heroes', 'sullied', 'manner', 'Even', 'was', 'only', 'man', 'not', 'Superman', 'person', 'had', 'right', 'live', 'out', 'life', 'one', 'married', 'woman', 'felt', 'differently', 'villain', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'pull', 'trigger', 'possible', 'did', 'person', 'story', 'presented', 'here', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'wonder']",TV's Best Adventures of Superman 2 VHS

In ""Crime Wave"" Metropolis is reeling under the onslaught of a series of crimes. The crime bosses have been united under a mysterious ""Mr. Big"" and the honest citizens are demanding action. A citizen's committee has been formed to coordinate the response and Superman has pledged his complete assistance.A checklist of the gangland leaders is formed and Superman proceeds to capture them one after another. However, none of the criminals will release any information about Mr. Big, so it is up to Superman to create a situation where the big boss is uncovered and captured. The plan is a simple one, relying on the arrogance of the criminals in believing that they can harm Superman. They fall for the ruse and all are easily captured.""The Perils of Superman"" were taken directly from the action serials, where there was a major point of danger at the end of each episode. In this case, a gang of men wearing lead masks are roaming the streets and plotting foul play against Superman through his friends, Clark Kent, Perry White, Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen. Each of them is captured and then placed in a situation of great danger. The situations are of a type seen in other contexts, Perry is tied to a log about to go through a saw, Lois is tied to a train track with a train on the way, Clark is about to be lowered into a vat of acid and the brakes and steering wheel of Jimmy's car has been sabotaged. Of course, Superman arrives seconds before the victim is to suffer their fate. However, in the case of Clark, Superman arrives much sooner than in the nick of time.Filmed in color, the odd thing about this episode is that nearly everything is blue or has a bluish tinge. The action is right out of the serials, providing a nostalgic look back at the fascinating entertainment of decades ago.Sometimes simplistic plots are charming and at other times they are boring. The nave nature of Superman series may be boring to modern children, but there was a time when it caused your imagination to soar to great heights. Some of us made that journey with Superman.This tape also includes the cartoon ""The Mechanical Monsters."" Developed in 1941, the robots are almost a model for the later ""Transformers"" toys that were a big hit decades in the future. These crime robots have a retractable propeller that allows them to fly and their arms and legs modify into wings and rudders.",4,These episodes exude the charm of the Superman series,1286755200,"10 11, 2010",2010,2578,"['special', 'effect', 'depictions', 'Superman', 'super', 'powers', 'episodes', 'pale', 'comparison', 'modern', 'standards', 'something', 'innocent', 'refreshing', 'television', 'series', 'Crime', 'Wave', 'Metropolis', 'reeling', 'onslaught', 'series', 'crimes', 'crime', 'bosses', 'have', 'been', 'united', 'mysterious', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'honest', 'citizens', 'are', 'demanding', 'action', 'citizen', 'committee', 'been', 'formed', 'coordinate', 'response', 'Superman', 'pledged', 'complete', 'assistance.A', 'checklist', 'gangland', 'leaders', 'formed', 'Superman', 'proceeds', 'capture', 'one', 'However', 'none', 'criminals', 'will', 'release', 'information', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'Superman', 'create', 'situation', 'where', 'big', 'boss', 'uncovered', 'captured', 'plan', 'simple', 'one', 'relying', 'arrogance', 'criminals', 'believing', 'can', 'harm', 'Superman', 'fall', 'ruse', 'are', 'easily', 'captured', 'Perils', 'Superman', 'were', 'taken', 'directly', 'action', 'serials', 'where', 'was', 'major', 'point', 'danger', 'end', 'episode', 'case', 'gang', 'men', 'wearing', 'lead', 'masks', 'are', 'roaming', 'streets', 'plotting', 'foul', 'play', 'Superman', 'friends', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Perry', 'White', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'captured', 'then', 'placed', 'situation', 'great', 'danger', 'situations', 'are', 'type', 'seen', 'other', 'contexts', 'Perry', 'tied', 'log', 'go', 'saw', 'Lois', 'tied', 'train', 'track', 'train', 'way', 'Clark', 'be', 'lowered', 'vat', 'acid', 'brakes', 'steering', 'wheel', 'Jimmy', 'car', 'been', 'sabotaged', 'course', 'Superman', 'seconds', 'victim', 'suffer', 'fate', 'However', 'case', 'Clark', 'Superman', 'much', 'sooner', 'nick', 'time.Filmed', 'color', 'odd', 'thing', 'episode', 'nearly', 'everything', 'blue', 'bluish', 'tinge', 'action', 'right', 'serials', 'providing', 'nostalgic', 'look', 'back', 'fascinating', 'entertainment', 'decades', 'ago.Sometimes', 'simplistic', 'plots', 'are', 'charming', 'other', 'times', 'are', 'boring', 'nave', 'nature', 'Superman', 'series', 'may', 'be', 'boring', 'modern', 'children', 'there', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'caused', 'imagination', 'soar', 'great', 'heights', 'made', 'journey', 'Superman.This', 'tape', 'also', 'cartoon', 'Mechanical', 'Monsters', 'Developed', '1941', 'robots', 'are', 'almost', 'model', 'later', 'Transformers', 'toys', 'were', 'big', 'hit', 'decades', 'future', 'crime', 'robots', 'have', 'retractable', 'propeller', 'fly', 'arms', 'legs', 'modify', 'wings', 'rudders']",TV's Best Adventures of Superman 2 VHS

Bernabo,"[22, 22]","Like the others in this series, Volume 2 of the &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; series offers up a pair of black &amp; white and color episodes from the syndicated television series starring George Reeves that ran from 1952-1957, along with one of the Fleischer Superman cartoons.  &quot;Crime Wave&quot; (Episode #24) finds Superman fighting a crime wave that is sweeps Metropolis only to be exposed to atomic rays.  This is one of the absolute classic episodes from this series, but this tape gets even better.  &quot;The Perils of Superman&quot; (Episode #103), finds a master criminal planning a series of traps to snare each of Superman's friends: Lois (Noel Neill), Jimmy (Jack Larson), Perry White (John Hamilton, and Clark Kent (George Reeves).  Of course, this is a plan that works so well it fails (for obvious reasons).  This was the second to last episode of the series and another classic.  The Fleischer's Cartoon &quot;The Mechanical Monsters&quot; is from 1941 and the second in the Superman series.  The Man of Steel battles an army of giant, flying robots that spew flame in a series of sensational scenes.  This is one of the best of the Superman cartoons and the only reason that this best volume in the &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; series is not #1 is because that tape has the pilot and final episodes on it.  But this is the one that will impress you the most from the dramatic opening narration to the final fade out on Reeves and the rest of the cast.",5,This is the best tape in the Adventures of Superman series,1009238400,"12 25, 2001",2001,1485,"['others', 'series', 'Volume', '2', 'quot', 'Adventures', 'Superman', 'quot', 'series', 'up', 'pair', 'black', 'amp', 'white', 'color', 'episodes', 'syndicated', 'television', 'series', 'starring', 'George', 'Reeves', 'ran', '1952-1957', 'one', 'Fleischer', 'Superman', 'cartoons', 'quot', 'Crime', 'Wave', 'quot', 'Episode', '24', 'Superman', 'fighting', 'crime', 'wave', 'sweeps', 'Metropolis', 'only', 'be', 'exposed', 'atomic', 'rays', 'one', 'absolute', 'classic', 'series', 'tape', 'even', 'better', 'quot', 'Perils', 'Superman', 'quot', 'Episode', '103', 'master', 'criminal', 'planning', 'series', 'traps', 'snare', 'Superman', 'friends', 'Lois', 'Noel', 'Neill', 'Jimmy', 'Jack', 'Larson', 'Perry', 'White', 'John', 'Hamilton', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'George', 'Reeves', 'course', 'plan', 'so', 'well', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'was', 'second', 'last', 'episode', 'series', 'classic', 'Fleischer', 'Cartoon', 'quot', 'Mechanical', 'Monsters', 'quot', '1941', 'second', 'Superman', 'series', 'Man', 'Steel', 'battles', 'army', 'giant', 'flying', 'robots', 'spew', 'flame', 'series', 'sensational', 'scenes', 'one', 'best', 'Superman', 'cartoons', 'only', 'reason', 'best', 'volume', 'quot', 'Adventures', 'Superman', 'quot', 'series', 'not', '1', 'tape', 'pilot', 'final', 'episodes', 'one', 'will', 'impress', 'most', 'dramatic', 'opening', 'narration', 'final', 'fade', 'out', 'Reeves', 'rest', 'cast']",TV's Best Adventures of Superman 2 VHS
