The first couple times I did this, I was screaming in pain and could not finish the entire work-out, but after a couple months of doing it 3 times a week about, I could do the whole 60 min. It is worth it, don't give up!! Plus, Mary Helen Bowers is so soft-spoken and beautiful, and the music is very soothing. I love the fact that she does a lot of quick stretches in between each exercise. I have actually gotten more flexible as well as stronger.",5,Excellent dvd,1358121600,"01 14, 2013",2013,683,"['have', 'had', 'knee', 'pain', 'physical', 'therapist', 'gave', 'list', 'exercises', 'do', 'strengthen', 'muscles', 'knees', 'hips', 'most', 'exercises', 'were', 'exactly', 'as', 'dvd', 'dvd', 'actually', 'even', 'more', 'first', 'couple', 'times', 'did', 'was', 'screaming', 'pain', 'could', 'not', 'finish', 'entire', 'work-out', 'couple', 'months', 'doing', '3', 'times', 'week', 'could', 'do', 'whole', '60', 'min', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'Mary', 'Helen', 'Bowers', 'so', 'soft-spoken', 'beautiful', 'music', 'very', 'soothing', 'love', 'fact', 'lot', 'quick', 'stretches', 'exercise', 'have', 'actually', 'gotten', 'more', 'flexible', 'as', 'well', 'stronger']",N/A
1496238,AVFPRHF73SF5B,B005OAWY7S,KS Film Fan,"[6, 7]","I just started exercising again and I'm particular about how I exercise.  My body is small and my muscles tend to bulk up quickly.  When I was younger, dance classes were a great way for me to lose weight and smooth out bulky muscles.So I was excited to see MHB's workout video. The video looks beautiful, the music is relaxing and MHB is very engaging.However this workout I find is extremely advanced.  These exercises are for people already in shape and looking for shaping refinement.  What would have made this workout perfect is if MHB took time to show the modifications for beginners before she started working on each set.  That being said, each exercise targets specific muscles and when done correctly you will feel the work being done.Please note, some of the leg and abdominal exercises are tough for people with knee problems and/or back problems.  These sections would have benefited greatly with more modification instructions.Since a new dvd will be released shortly, perhaps there will be more attention to beginners.",4,Lovely and extremely tough workout,1343433600,"07 28, 2012",2012,1035,"['just', 'started', 'exercising', 'again', ""'m"", 'particular', 'how', 'exercise', 'body', 'small', 'muscles', 'tend', 'bulk', 'up', 'quickly', 'When', 'was', 'younger', 'dance', 'classes', 'were', 'great', 'way', 'lose', 'weight', 'smooth', 'out', 'bulky', 'muscles.So', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'MHB', 'workout', 'video', 'video', 'beautiful', 'music', 'relaxing', 'MHB', 'very', 'engaging.However', 'workout', 'find', 'extremely', 'advanced', 'exercises', 'are', 'people', 'already', 'shape', 'looking', 'shaping', 'refinement', 'What', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'workout', 'perfect', 'MHB', 'took', 'time', 'show', 'modifications', 'beginners', 'started', 'working', 'set', 'being', 'said', 'exercise', 'targets', 'specific', 'muscles', 'when', 'done', 'correctly', 'will', 'feel', 'work', 'being', 'done.Please', 'note', 'leg', 'abdominal', 'exercises', 'are', 'tough', 'people', 'knee', 'problems', 'and/or', 'back', 'problems', 'sections', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'greatly', 'more', 'modification', 'instructions.Since', 'new', 'dvd', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'shortly', 'perhaps', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'attention', 'beginners']",N/A

1496240,A2EIEFWC5RRFH7,B005OAWY7S,NotThatGirl,"[32, 33]","Ballet Beautiful is by far my favorite workout to do and I absolutely cannot rave enough about the results I am getting and how enjoyable it is to do. Before learning about Mary Helen's program I was a total Tracy Anderson devotee. I didn't ever think I could find another workout that I would enjoy as much as Tracy's programs. Ballet Beautiful is so much fun and I always look forward to doing it which is not something I could always say for TA. I love everything about this dvd. The set is clean and the camera angles show you what Mary Helen is doing. She is encouraging without being a cheerleader, something I can't stomach. Her counting keeps me on track and I love the breaks that are taken for stretching. I own both of her dvd's and her streaming videos. While I love the blast dvd, I enjoy this 60 minute classic workout the most. The video is chaptered so it's easy to mix and match what you feel like doing if you don't have time for the whole 60 minutes. My customer service experience with her has been amazing and I look forward to more from Ballet Beautiful!*May 2012: This is still my favorite workout to do, I reach for it all the time and I am loving my results. I have also purchased her newest streaming videos, the cardio series and abs and couldn't be more pleased. This workout is amazing, and their customer service is still top notch!

1496241,A1D2Y0RG6D1ZSL,B005OAWY7S,"Silly Sally ""Sally""","[9, 10]","I love the Ballet Beautiful DVD's and streaming videos that you can buy from Amazon and Ms. Bower's website.  This DVD I do think is easier than her Blast series, but still the exercises will work your body without over stressing the joints.  I also enjoy the music options and the music track she does play is a thousand times better than the elevator crap most ballet workouts use.  Furthermore, I am tired of doing ballet-inspired workouts from instructors who have very little if any ballet experience. If you are trained dancer watching ballet workouts in which the instructors have little to no ballet form and have a girl version body of the Incredible Hulk is annoying.  Ballet is about form not about throwing your body around like a drunk aerobics instructor. That said you do not have to ballet experience to do this DVD, but having an instructor who knows ballet form is a MUST in a ballet type workout",5,Love it!,1328313600,"02 4, 2012",2012,914,"['love', 'Ballet', 'Beautiful', 'DVD', 'streaming', 'videos', 'can', 'buy', 'Amazon', 'Ms.', 'Bower', 'website', 'DVD', 'do', 'think', 'easier', 'Blast', 'series', 'still', 'exercises', 'will', 'work', 'body', 'stressing', 'joints', 'also', 'enjoy', 'music', 'options', 'music', 'track', 'play', 'thousand', 'times', 'better', 'elevator', 'crap', 'most', 'ballet', 'workouts', 'use', 'Furthermore', 'am', 'tired', 'doing', 'ballet-inspired', 'workouts', 'instructors', 'who', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'ballet', 'experience', 'are', 'trained', 'dancer', 'watching', 'ballet', 'workouts', 'instructors', 'have', 'little', 'ballet', 'form', 'have', 'girl', 'version', 'body', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'annoying', 'Ballet', 'about', 'form', 'not', 'throwing', 'body', 'drunk', 'aerobics', 'instructor', 'said', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'ballet', 'experience', 'do', 'DVD', 'having', 'instructor', 'who', 'ballet', 'form', 'MUST', 'ballet', 'type', 'workout']",N/A

I love how relaxed the setting is and how do-able the exercises are.For me, this is sort of the opposite of the Blast Series, which is too rough on my weak wrists. There is one arm exercise that has you put your arms behind you and lift your seat which I skip over because of my wrist injuries, but other than that it seems like overall this is pretty gentle on the joints.I thought I was in okay shape because of being a Tracy Anderson fan for a couple years now, but I think this DVD is a bit different, and difficult and painful in a really good way! I think some people will complain because of the Title Sequences that pop up between each series of exercises, but I like them because it gives me more time to stretch out my poor muscles.

1496243,AM6HIBRKJ3PC4,B005OAWY7S,Tara K.,"[2, 9]",The main thing that threw me off were her body proportions. Yes I know she is a professional dancer but her waist and hips are non existent. It made it very difficult to tell if I was doing a move correctly when her body is perfectly flat in ever aspect. She looks a little thinspiration to me and since I have suffered with anorexia it was very hard to do this video.Secondly very little is explained and for some exercises especially the thighs I have no idea how she was holding herself in certain crazy positions.The music was very good and I really like the feature that let you turn the music on and off.I love the part at the end where we actually did some ballet dancing. She needs to make a video that is only her doing the dance step not all the exercises. With maybe some stretching at the end. All very slow and well explained.If you are a dancer or have a great body already this is the DVD for you. For anyone else I would take a pass on this. I'm planning on donating the DVD.,3,Not bad but not what I was expecting,1337990400,"05 26, 2012",2012,991,"['main', 'thing', 'threw', 'off', 'were', 'body', 'proportions', 'Yes', 'know', 'professional', 'dancer', 'waist', 'hips', 'are', 'non', 'existent', 'made', 'very', 'difficult', 'tell', 'was', 'doing', 'move', 'correctly', 'when', 'body', 'perfectly', 'flat', 'ever', 'aspect', 'little', 'thinspiration', 'have', 'suffered', 'anorexia', 'was', 'very', 'hard', 'do', 'video.Secondly', 'very', 'little', 'explained', 'exercises', 'especially', 'thighs', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'was', 'holding', 'certain', 'crazy', 'positions.The', 'music', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'really', 'feature', 'let', 'turn', 'music', 'off.I', 'love', 'part', 'end', 'where', 'actually', 'did', 'ballet', 'dancing', 'make', 'video', 'only', 'doing', 'dance', 'step', 'not', 'exercises', 'maybe', 'stretching', 'end', 'very', 'slow', 'well', 'are', 'dancer', 'have', 'great', 'body', 'already', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'else', 'would', 'take', 'pass', ""'m"", 'planning', 'donating', 'DVD']",N/A
