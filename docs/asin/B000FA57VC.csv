It is considered acceptable for the church to execute heretics which includes Jews. There have been several murders of noblemen in a village that the local sheriff, played by Thomas Jane, is investigating. As he unravels the motives there are a few red herrings that twist and turn the case making it far more complicated than he would have ever imagined. When he approaches religious and government officials they seem to have no interest in his findings, and to make matters worse his evidence keeps disappearing. His own demons from his past are not helping him prove his reliability. Good quality DVD with only bare minimum of features.

I only watched this (thank you DVR) because it had Christopher Lambert and Brian Blessed (father of the first Black Adder) in it. Unfortunately, everyone in this movie was terrible. I think they just took the money (and embarrassment) and left their acting chops home. Blanca Marsillach was well represented by a body double in the nude scenes and Szonja Oroszl&aacute;n was very cute in a long red wig and her crossed eyes. Unfortunately, neither of these ladies can act their way out of a paper bag. The only decent performance (and interesting character) was Luk&aacute;cs Bicskey as the mercenary. They should have made the movie about him. The fights were horribly choreographed and Lambert curiously managed to lose every fight his was engaged. The script was ridiculous and not as believable as the Moon is made of green cheese.(SPOILER ALERT) I just wish that instead of murdering everyone on the list to eliminate an unidentified blackmailer, they would have just set a trap when delivering the blackmail payment, but this would make way too much sense.

The movie Gideon was decent.  Here, he plays a sherrif of a town in Spain in 1542.  I swear they stuck him in the role because the still think he can swing a sword like ""the Highlander"".  They really needed a younger character for the part, he almost looked older than the person who was playing the Govenor, who we find out is his uncle.  But the movie just didn't grab the attention that the story could have, and that was probably just the scripwriting.  And the swordwork, I agree with some of the other reviews, just not crisp, like the kings/govenors soldiers had never practiced. At times it looked like two kids in a backyard fighting with twigs.
