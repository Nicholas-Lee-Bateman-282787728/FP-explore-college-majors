404810,A3BD5XZUWUF3OX,6304159447,"A. Sanchez ""Shepherd""","[7, 8]","If you like movies that are done more for art than for story writing, I believe you will love this movie no matter what orientation one might be. It is as one person said, ""Poetry in Motion"". It appears to be based on a poem, ""She Walks in Beauty"" by Byron.However, I like a love story with a plot and dialogue, and this is not that type of movie. It is a love poem, not a story with dialogue and plot. It is for that reason that I can only give it a 3 star.The film itself was black and white, but faded. It looked like a picture where the sun has hit it so much that it faded. The audio isn't very good either. I had to put the speakers all the way up in order to hear it. Finally, the bottom portion of the film was chopped off, so sometimes I would see partial heads and bodies if the scene was on the bottom. Don't know if this is Amazon's problem or the film itself.One very positive thing I can say is that the love scenes made you feel like the two main characters really loved each other, unlike other ""lesbian films"" where the actors don't do a good job of acting as true lesbians in love. This is a beautiful lesbian art film, but one I would not want to watch more than once even though I love independent, provocative, foreign, ""artsy"" type films.",3,Art and Poetry,1290470400,"11 23, 2010",2010,1260,"['like', 'movies', 'are', 'done', 'more', 'art', 'story', 'writing', 'believe', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'matter', 'what', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'person', 'said', 'Poetry', 'Motion', 'be', 'based', 'poem', 'Beauty', 'Byron.However', 'like', 'love', 'story', 'plot', 'dialogue', 'not', 'type', 'movie', 'love', 'poem', 'not', 'story', 'dialogue', 'plot', 'reason', 'can', 'only', 'give', '3', 'star.The', 'film', 'was', 'black', 'white', 'faded', 'looked', 'picture', 'where', 'sun', 'hit', 'so', 'much', 'faded', 'audio', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'either', 'had', 'put', 'speakers', 'way', 'up', 'order', 'hear', 'Finally', 'bottom', 'portion', 'film', 'was', 'chopped', 'off', 'sometimes', 'would', 'see', 'partial', 'heads', 'bodies', 'scene', 'was', 'bottom', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Amazon', 'problem', 'film', 'itself.One', 'very', 'positive', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'love', 'scenes', 'made', 'feel', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'really', 'loved', 'other', 'other', 'lesbian', 'films', 'where', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'good', 'job', 'acting', 'true', 'lesbians', 'love', 'beautiful', 'lesbian', 'art', 'film', 'one', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'even', 'love', 'independent', 'provocative', 'foreign', 'artsy', 'type', 'films']",Cynara VHS

The direction and acting in this film is remarkable, with the models (Melissa Hellman and Johana Nemeth) gracefully fitting their acting, and movements, to the rhythm and sensuality of the screenplay.This is not a romance for vulgar interests.  It is an elegant adaptation, in fantasy, of Lord Byron's immortal poem: ""She Walks in Beauty.""  (see below)The scenes include a lesbian sculptress creating extraordinary feminine, sensuous sculptures, and, music (including one of Suzanne Cianni's solo piano piecesPianissimo) which leads the viewer to the climax of the love scenes.  The nudity and pose, of the models, are tasetful and erotic, relying on flowering suggestion rather than explicit display.The two models are a pinnacle of physical feminine beauty in our age, and, statuesquely beautiful, in any measure of art, from any age.For those of you who are not familiar with Melissa Hellman and Johanna Nemeth, they are favorite subjects of Judy Francesconi's superb (lesbian interest) photography.Visual Sonnets.  I will upload one of Ms. Francesconi's exquisite photographs (which I own) of these two models.  The photograph adorns the cover of a classical music album by the same name of the photograph: ""Dreams of Desire.""Dreams of DesireIf you are searching for mediocrity in sensual gratification, this is not the film for you.  However, if you can appreciate art, poetry, music and physical feminine beautfy taken to its highest form, and, woven together into a classic adaptation, then you would find it hard to surpass the excellent performances, screenplay and imagery of this film.She walks in beauty, like the nightOf cloudless climes and starry skies;And all that's best of dark and brightMeet in her aspect and her eyes:Thus mellowed to that tender lightWhich heaven to gaudy day denies.One shade the more, one ray the less,Had half impaired the nameless graceWhich waves in every raven tress,Or softly lightens o'er her face;Where thoughts serenely sweet expressHow pure, how dear their dwelling place.And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,The smiles that win, the tints that glow,But tell of days in goodness spent,A mind at peace with all below,A heart whose love is innocent!- Byron",5,A work of Art,1342224000,"07 14, 2012",2012,2345,"['strongly', 'disagree', 'detracting', 'reviews', 'film.The', 'subtitle', 'Cynara', 'Poetry', 'Motion', 'direction', 'acting', 'film', 'remarkable', 'models', 'Melissa', 'Hellman', 'Johana', 'Nemeth', 'gracefully', 'fitting', 'acting', 'movements', 'rhythm', 'sensuality', 'screenplay.This', 'not', 'romance', 'vulgar', 'interests', 'elegant', 'adaptation', 'fantasy', 'Lord', 'Byron', 'immortal', 'poem', 'Beauty', 'see', 'scenes', 'include', 'lesbian', 'sculptress', 'creating', 'extraordinary', 'feminine', 'sensuous', 'sculptures', 'music', 'including', 'one', 'Suzanne', 'Cianni', 'solo', 'piano', 'piecesPianissimo', 'viewer', 'climax', 'love', 'scenes', 'nudity', 'pose', 'models', 'are', 'tasetful', 'erotic', 'relying', 'flowering', 'suggestion', 'rather', 'explicit', 'display.The', 'two', 'models', 'are', 'pinnacle', 'physical', 'feminine', 'beauty', 'age', 'statuesquely', 'beautiful', 'measure', 'art', 'age.For', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'Melissa', 'Hellman', 'Johanna', 'Nemeth', 'are', 'favorite', 'subjects', 'Judy', 'Francesconi', 'superb', 'lesbian', 'interest', 'photography.Visual', 'Sonnets', 'will', 'upload', 'one', 'Ms.', 'Francesconi', 'exquisite', 'photographs', 'own', 'two', 'models', 'photograph', 'cover', 'classical', 'music', 'album', 'same', 'name', 'photograph', 'Dreams', 'Desire', 'Dreams', 'DesireIf', 'are', 'searching', 'mediocrity', 'sensual', 'gratification', 'not', 'film', 'However', 'can', 'appreciate', 'art', 'poetry', 'music', 'physical', 'feminine', 'beautfy', 'taken', 'highest', 'form', 'woven', 'together', 'classic', 'adaptation', 'then', 'would', 'find', 'hard', 'surpass', 'excellent', 'performances', 'screenplay', 'imagery', 'film.She', 'walks', 'beauty', 'nightOf', 'cloudless', 'climes', 'starry', 'skies', 'best', 'dark', 'brightMeet', 'aspect', 'eyes', 'Thus', 'mellowed', 'tender', 'lightWhich', 'heaven', 'gaudy', 'day', 'denies.One', 'shade', 'more', 'one', 'ray', 'less', 'Had', 'half', 'impaired', 'nameless', 'graceWhich', 'waves', 'raven', 'tress', 'softly', 'face', 'Where', 'thoughts', 'serenely', 'sweet', 'expressHow', 'pure', 'how', 'dear', 'dwelling', 'place.And', 'cheek', 'brow', 'So', 'soft', 'so', 'calm', 'yet', 'eloquent', 'smiles', 'win', 'tints', 'glow', 'tell', 'days', 'goodness', 'spent', 'mind', 'peace', 'below', 'A', 'heart', 'love', 'innocent', 'Byron']",Cynara VHS

404828,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6304159447,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 4]","Cynara: Poetry in Motion (Nicole Conn, 1996)I apologize in advance for saying this, because I'm even starting to annoy myself when I do. Every time I review a short film (and I define ""short film"" as anything that clocks in under sixty minutes), I start the review off by saying that I never review short films. I don't do it because if I did, I'd be even father behind in my reviewing than I already am; I probably watch two short films for every feature (and according to my spreadsheet, as I write this, on January 18, 2010, I have watched fourteen features so far this year). But every once in a while, a short film is so good (or so bad) that I can't help myself. And I end up writing that ""I don't normally do this"" opening sentence every damn time. Sorry about that. Still, though, I've reviewed a handful, at most, of shorts in the past five years. I have to be really moved. And the most recent short to do it is Nicole Conn's 1996 film Cynara: Poetry in Motion. This is a film that should by every possible right have been inestimably cheesy. Instead, it's possibly the most erotic, and the most romantic, forty minutes I have ever seen on a screen.The movie takes place in 1883, at Baycliff, a seaside resort in England. Cynara (Johanna Nemeth in her only screen appearance, though she's done some behind-the-scenes work; she was a production designer on Mark Polish's brilliant Northfork) is living there. She's been there for quite a while; the opening monologue is from a letter Cynara wrote to her aunt, expressing her intense boredom. Visually, while this is going on, she's working with clay. It's all very abstract and Merchant-Ivory and blah blah blah, but there's something very yonic (is that a word?) about the clay and the way Cynara's fingers are massaging it. Enter Byron (Growing Up Thirty's Melissa Hellman), the poet, whom the film recasts as female, but masculine; not in the sense of the butch dyke so common in media, but in the sense of lean, muscular, handsome, but still very aware of being a woman. (My apologies if this is as tough to understand while you're reading it as it is for me to try and describe it.) The two are instantly drawn to one another, and the bulk of the film takes place alternately in their fantasies, which are deliciously explicit, and the reality, which is as restrained as you'd expect Victorian society to be; the two of them flirt, and get just to the point where a kiss is about to happen, but propriety stops it from actually happening. My god, it must have been frustrating to live in Victorian times.The end result, however, is stunning. Conn strikes the perfect balance of explicitness and restraint to bring out both the film's softcore tendencies (what a different world film would be if, say, Radley Metzger had a tenth this much talent, or the Dark Brothers one one-hundredth of Conn's sense of the erotic!) and the tender, searing frustration of everything that's not a dream sequence. Are these two ever actually going to get together? As an amusing side note, the running time of the movie stands as a mute excoriation of the attempt to keep sexual tension running through the two main characters of any long-running TV series (The X-Files, anyone?). No wonder the tension between Emily Deschanel and David Boreanaz lasted for about half the first season in Bones. That said, give Conn a big-time network drama with two characters who have a reason for not knocking boots; I have every faith that she could pull it off where so many others have failed.One way or the other, though, get your hands on a copy of Cynara: Poetry in Motion if you have a romantic bone in your body and if you're not turned off by the explicitness. The movie has a shockingly low IMDB rating (3.9 as of January 18, 2010), but only forty-eight votes. That's hardly a representative sampling, one thinks, and I have a strong suspicion that if the film got more press, a lot more people who might actually like the thing might see it. And thus, I'm once again breaking my rule about not reviewing shorts. See this movie. It manages to be both smart and jaw-droppingly sexy at the same time, and the more supposedly erotic movies I see, the more I understand how rare that combination is. ****",4,Stunning.,1264550400,"01 27, 2010",2010,4242,"['Cynara', 'Poetry', 'Motion', 'Nicole', 'Conn', '1996', 'apologize', 'advance', 'saying', ""'m"", 'even', 'starting', 'annoy', 'when', 'do', 'Every', 'time', 'review', 'short', 'film', 'define', 'short', 'film', 'anything', 'sixty', 'minutes', 'start', 'review', 'off', 'saying', 'never', 'review', 'short', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'did', ""'d"", 'be', 'even', 'father', 'behind', 'reviewing', 'already', 'am', 'probably', 'watch', 'two', 'short', 'films', 'feature', 'according', 'spreadsheet', 'write', 'January', '18', '2010', 'have', 'watched', 'fourteen', 'features', 'so', 'far', 'year', 'once', 'while', 'short', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'so', 'bad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'myself', 'end', 'up', 'writing', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'do', 'opening', 'sentence', 'damn', 'time', 'Sorry', 'Still', ""'ve"", 'reviewed', 'handful', 'most', 'shorts', 'past', 'five', 'years', 'have', 'be', 'really', 'moved', 'most', 'recent', 'short', 'do', 'Nicole', 'Conn', '1996', 'film', 'Cynara', 'Poetry', 'Motion', 'film', 'should', 'possible', 'right', 'have', 'been', 'inestimably', 'cheesy', 'Instead', 'possibly', 'most', 'erotic', 'most', 'romantic', 'forty', 'minutes', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'screen.The', 'movie', 'place', '1883', 'Baycliff', 'seaside', 'resort', 'England', 'Cynara', 'Johanna', 'Nemeth', 'only', 'screen', 'appearance', 'done', 'behind-the-scenes', 'work', 'was', 'production', 'designer', 'Mark', 'Polish', 'brilliant', 'Northfork', 'living', 'there', 'been', 'there', 'quite', 'while', 'opening', 'monologue', 'letter', 'Cynara', 'wrote', 'aunt', 'expressing', 'intense', 'boredom', 'Visually', 'going', 'working', 'clay', 'very', 'abstract', 'Merchant-Ivory', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'something', 'very', 'yonic', 'word', 'clay', 'way', 'Cynara', 'fingers', 'are', 'massaging', 'Enter', 'Byron', 'Growing', 'Up', 'Thirty', 'Melissa', 'Hellman', 'poet', 'whom', 'film', 'female', 'masculine', 'not', 'sense', 'butch', 'dyke', 'so', 'common', 'media', 'sense', 'lean', 'muscular', 'handsome', 'still', 'very', 'aware', 'being', 'woman', 'apologies', 'as', 'tough', 'understand', ""'re"", 'reading', 'try', 'describe', 'two', 'are', 'instantly', 'drawn', 'one', 'bulk', 'film', 'place', 'alternately', 'fantasies', 'are', 'deliciously', 'explicit', 'reality', 'as', 'restrained', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Victorian', 'society', 'be', 'two', 'flirt', 'get', 'just', 'point', 'where', 'kiss', 'happen', 'propriety', 'stops', 'actually', 'happening', 'My', 'god', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'frustrating', 'live', 'Victorian', 'times.The', 'end', 'result', 'however', 'stunning', 'Conn', 'perfect', 'balance', 'explicitness', 'restraint', 'bring', 'out', 'film', 'softcore', 'tendencies', 'what', 'different', 'world', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'say', 'Radley', 'Metzger', 'had', 'tenth', 'much', 'talent', 'Dark', 'Brothers', 'one', 'one-hundredth', 'Conn', 'sense', 'erotic', 'tender', 'searing', 'frustration', 'everything', 'not', 'dream', 'sequence', 'Are', 'two', 'ever', 'actually', 'going', 'get', 'together', 'amusing', 'side', 'note', 'running', 'time', 'movie', 'mute', 'excoriation', 'attempt', 'keep', 'sexual', 'tension', 'running', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'long-running', 'TV', 'series', 'X-Files', 'anyone', 'No', 'wonder', 'tension', 'Emily', 'Deschanel', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'lasted', 'first', 'season', 'Bones', 'said', 'give', 'Conn', 'big-time', 'network', 'drama', 'two', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'reason', 'not', 'knocking', 'boots', 'have', 'faith', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'failed.One', 'way', 'other', 'though', 'get', 'hands', 'copy', 'Cynara', 'Poetry', 'Motion', 'have', 'romantic', 'bone', 'body', ""'re"", 'not', 'turned', 'off', 'explicitness', 'movie', 'shockingly', 'low', 'IMDB', 'rating', '3.9', 'January', '18', '2010', 'only', 'forty-eight', 'votes', 'hardly', 'representative', 'sampling', 'one', 'thinks', 'have', 'strong', 'suspicion', 'film', 'got', 'more', 'press', 'lot', 'more', 'people', 'who', 'might', 'actually', 'thing', 'might', 'see', 'thus', ""'m"", 'once', 'again', 'breaking', 'rule', 'not', 'reviewing', 'shorts', 'See', 'movie', 'be', 'smart', 'jaw-droppingly', 'sexy', 'same', 'time', 'more', 'supposedly', 'erotic', 'movies', 'see', 'more', 'understand', 'how', 'rare', 'combination', '****']",Cynara VHS
404829,A1F9YNY2KTBO5H,6304159447,Robert L. Cochran,"[2, 2]","I really enjoyed watching this movie. I am curious about lesbian sexuality and this movie helped me learn a little more with two extremely gifted and beautiful actors and a wonderful director and crew. I'm also interested in the details of the different scenes. For example, the seashore scenes appear to act as a signal that time has passed and the ladies are getting to know each other better. Yet they both seem to wear the same or very similar clothes at each meeting. Yet they are obviously well-to-do women who can afford dresses, horses, and anything else. The sets are interesting also. In one scene they walk down a long corridor, obviously of a very wealthy person's home. They are perfectly alone, they have total privacy. No servants waiting on them or men, either. The same is true of the beach scenes. They have perfect privacy on the beach. You would think others would be around enjoying their own walks or rides. I was also interested on one scene that showed a particular globe-shaped lamp for just a second or two. To me it looks like an electric lamp. However, the lampshade is of such sophistication and artistic appeal that if this were indeed an electric lamp, it must have come from a much later period. Electric lighting was just getting started in 1883. Elsewhere in the movie, we see the expected candles.I am now wondering how lesbian couples in England and indeed Europe in the 1880s developed and enjoyed and continued their relationships. It is pretty normal for same-sex individuals to live together and I presume that some of these shared the same bed and enjoyed their lives together. No doubt they were extremely discreet about it, but I would think it was truly no different from heterosexual couples living together -- married or not.I think this movie is extremely beautiful and recommend it to anyone curious about lesbian sexuality and perhaps a very narrow and imperfect glimpse of England in the 1880s.",5,Beautiful Movie!
