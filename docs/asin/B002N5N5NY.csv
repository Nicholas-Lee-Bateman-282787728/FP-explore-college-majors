He formerly played Billy on 6 FEET UNDER and had a fans from there he's carried to this show.  This episode gives him the star turn this time of making a prime jackass out of himself over the female star witness in a case he is working. Even worse, as the case goes forward, it begins to seem that she is less a witness and more a suspect.  The expression ""sweating bullets"" could have been coined for him for this episode.  I really enjoyed seeing Sisto get a meatier role this time out.

1279350,AGB7UQZMVHNUJ,B002N5N5NY,"NewDiane ""I live to read!""","[4, 4]","One of the best things about the final season of Law & Order is the thread that runs through it about Lt. Van Buren and her battle against cancer. S. Epatha Merkerson gives a moving portrayal of a strong, independent woman trying not to be crushed by disease and medical expenses. As always, the acting in every episode is top-notch, and many actors who appeared in earlier years reappear in different roles. One of the finest episodes is ""Immortal"", which is a spin on a real situation (well described in the bestselling book ""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks""). The last episode literally ends with a bang, as the police hunt for someone who plans to bomb a city school. Watching this a mere week after the Boston Marathon bombing made it especially suspenseful and relevant. As has been the custom throughout twenty years, there is very little in the way of special effects. Everything hinges upon writing and acting, and the stories are gripping, often related to headline news. Another episode that was particularly chilling dealt with people who arranged for sick relatives to conveniently die before estate tax abatements were repealed. There were no bad or mediocre episodes; the final season was simply fine.",5,A venerable series ends with a bang,1366761600,"04 24, 2013",2013,1221,"['One', 'best', 'things', 'final', 'season', 'Law', 'Order', 'thread', 'Lt.', 'Van', 'Buren', 'battle', 'cancer', 'S.', 'Epatha', 'Merkerson', 'moving', 'portrayal', 'strong', 'independent', 'woman', 'trying', 'not', 'be', 'crushed', 'disease', 'medical', 'expenses', 'always', 'acting', 'episode', 'top-notch', 'many', 'actors', 'who', 'appeared', 'earlier', 'years', 'reappear', 'different', 'roles', 'One', 'finest', 'episodes', 'Immortal', 'spin', 'real', 'situation', 'well', 'described', 'bestselling', 'book', 'Immortal', 'Life', 'Henrietta', 'Lacks', 'last', 'episode', 'literally', 'bang', 'police', 'hunt', 'someone', 'who', 'bomb', 'city', 'school', 'Watching', 'mere', 'week', 'Boston', 'Marathon', 'bombing', 'made', 'especially', 'suspenseful', 'relevant', 'been', 'custom', 'twenty', 'years', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'special', 'effects', 'Everything', 'writing', 'acting', 'stories', 'are', 'gripping', 'often', 'related', 'headline', 'news', 'episode', 'was', 'particularly', 'chilling', 'dealt', 'people', 'who', 'arranged', 'sick', 'relatives', 'conveniently', 'die', 'estate', 'tax', 'abatements', 'were', 'repealed', 'were', 'bad', 'mediocre', 'episodes', 'final', 'season', 'was', 'simply', 'fine']",N/A

In the opening sequences he is sitting in the back but in the final court scenes he is the black guy sitting right up front.
