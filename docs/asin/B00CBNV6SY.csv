1645643,A2DI9XP5ITS3P,B00CBNV6SY,"Allegrobas ""Allegrobas""","[3, 7]","Movie starts with good tension and mystery, but then the gig is up.  Several people wake up in a commercial airplane but none know how they got there. Oh, oh, the earth below is being consumed by nuclear apocalypse. The news on the one smart phone aboard tell of how big cities are being erased from the map. But how is it that those aboard were saved?  And their families below?Quickly there appear many inconsistencies on this miraculous saving of their lives, and we the viewers, as well as the characters, want answers.  As the answers trickle in (well before the half-way mark on the film), the thriller potential quickly deflates like a tire with a big cut on the side. Is the government involved in this miraculous rescue of these few folks on this airplane?  Why? So, not only is there NO CLIMAX in this movie, but the tension starts to erode at around the midpoint. To make matters worse, the ending is ambiguous and totally unsatisfying for the viewer.
