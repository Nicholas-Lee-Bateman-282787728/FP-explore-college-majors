Unfortunately this is just a bad Danny Trejo movie with no quotation marks. Danny plays an Eastern holy man/healer who likes flowers. He gets killed in the first scene, but unlike the movie, he doesn't completely die. He can't pass over because there is still work to do, so he occasionally resurrects and helps others along the way.Danny is killed because his peaceful village, where young girls bathe topless in the stream, is raided by Gary Daniels to abduct girls for the sex trade. Meanwhile, John Edward Lee is getting ready to die and has a brief case full of money. He wants a woman. Together Danny and Lee fight against the bad guys (with some police help) to save Nana (Krystal Vee).The film is rather boring. While there is killing, there are not any of the ""walking tall"" action one would expect in a Trejo film. This is far from a grindhouse, although it makes you think it started out as one.

1520370,AXYK35P5RCPJ2,B006VUQIYA,Trejofan,"[1, 1]","Watching these movies starring Mr. Trejo and knowing that he prefers to be killed off, this one was quite a surprise. When he gets killed off the first time within about 15 minutes from the start of the movie, I figured that it was yet another &#34;cameo&#34; role for him.  However, I was happy to see that he not only appears many times through out the movie, he gets to be killed off several times!  It centers around Nana and Lonnie, who meet after Nana was kidnapped and held in the sex trade and is HIV positive and makes her escape. Lonnie is literally in his final days of life and neither wants to die alone.  Of course they are the romantic interests in this film.  Sebastian Riker (Gary Daniels) is the arch villain, evil to the core (why are the villains now all from the UK or Australia?), with Bai Ling as the evil and perverted &#34;madam&#34; of the operation who actually is  &#34;Mister&#34; as in the movie &#34;Transamerica&#34; or &#34;The Crying Game&#34;. Also, I was quite surprised to see a young man that appeared to be a dead ringer for Forrest Whitaker but without the left-sided micro-opthalmia (a smaller eye).  Turned out it was Damon Whitaker and must be related. He did an excellent job. It has some beautiful settings, and amazing scenery, and the story is very endearing and heart-warming without being too blood-spattering.  This one will go in the &#34;Trejo&#34; collection for multiple watchings. Although this was no &#34;star wars&#34; or &#34;Schindler's List&#34; I believe it deserves a 4 star rating because it was a good story and held my interest.
