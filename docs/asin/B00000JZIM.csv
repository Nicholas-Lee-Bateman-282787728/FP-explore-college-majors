Or RAIN MAN, another fine film. But hey, the guy can give us a nasty edge if the script calls for it. Hoffman became Lenny Bruce. Bruce's material was great at times and awful at others. Nowadays, of course, none of it would be shocking. The film shows us Bruce's faults, unedited, presumably in contrast to the great material he could produce because of and/or in spite of his excesses. But still, something is missing. Something crucial. I don't know what. I only know this film could have been so much better.",2,"I like Lenny Bruce just fine, but...",1156723200,"08 28, 2006",2006,636,"['always', 'thought', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Tootsie', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'producer', 'WAG', 'THE', 'DOG', 'love', 'RAIN', 'MAN', 'fine', 'film', 'hey', 'guy', 'can', 'give', 'nasty', 'edge', 'script', 'Hoffman', 'became', 'Lenny', 'Bruce', 'Bruce', 'material', 'was', 'great', 'times', 'awful', 'others', 'Nowadays', 'course', 'none', 'would', 'be', 'shocking', 'film', 'Bruce', 'faults', 'unedited', 'presumably', 'contrast', 'great', 'material', 'could', 'produce', 'and/or', 'spite', 'excesses', 'still', 'something', 'missing', 'Something', 'crucial', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'only', 'know', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better']",Lenny VHS
508691,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00000JZIM,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[18, 18]","I went into this film knowing nothing about the comic Lenny Bruce, and after watching this film I have already added two of his CDs to my Wish List.  I am eager to hear more, to listen to his words, and be intrigued by how his thoughts are still relevant in today's society.  This was a beautiful film made in 1974.  The decision by director Bob Fosse to film it completely in black and white was brilliant.  Hoffman and Perrine's chemistry is brilliant as well as their performances.  The power of this man is vividly demonstrated through this film, leaving you with questions answered as well as a desire to hear more.  This was such a captivating feature.  From the opening sequence of words spewing from a mouth to the final shot of Lenny Bruce, I was glued to my seat.To begin, the cinematography was better than most feature films.  Fosse knew what he was doing and did it with the greatest of ease.  His choice to film completely in black and white really helped me hear the words that Bruce spoke instead of just being involved in the colors that surrounded him.  The black and white feature gave Hoffman the ability to create a human from his character and take us away from Hoffman and into the mind of comic Lenny Bruce.  The shots that Fosse used also assisted with building this compelling story.  Every shot is important in this film, and Fosse does a great job of demonstrating and explaining the ""why"" and ""where"" of a scene.  This was his first and only nonmusical, and he was triumphant.  The way that the story works in a pseudo-documentary style was impeccable.  While you are never quite told who the person is behind the camera, you do get that raw emotion from the actors as if you were watching a real documentary.  There was just so much emotion that Fosse pulled from his troupe in this film that you could only watch in amazement.  It also left the door open to the question of who is behind the camera.  With the words that Bruce said nightly in his show, I couldn't help but think of the possibility of government conspiracy.  Maybe I am way off, but there was that aura of ""cover-up"" throughout this film.  Even the final sequence gives off that sense.BAM - Powerful cinematography is right in front of you, but whom do we have in the center of the camera?  None other than a very young and fresh Dustin Hoffman.  This film really showcased his talents.  While he had several films before this one that brought him into the spotlight, I thought that he went above and beyond for this film.  He really transformed himself into the character.  Some of my favorite moments with Hoffman in Lenny was when he thinks about the nurse the first time, when Honey calls asking for money, and when he asks the Judge to sentence him now instead of going through the trial.  The vision of defeat was spectacular.  You see in this film why Hoffman is considered one of the greats of Hollywood.  Valerie Perrine, also a young actress at the time, was immaculate.  Her portrayal of Honey needs to go in the history books.  Actresses today could take a moment or two to learn from this dramatic actress.  These two actors really brought this film together.  They took you deep into the life of this radical thinker and kept you nestled deeply inside of him.  They shined greatly, and the Academy saw it too!BAM - Cinematography, BAM - award winning acting, what can be the final BAM?  How about Lenny Bruce?  Born well after his death, I had never even heard of the man, but the words that I witnessed from this film from his mouth shocked me.  Not so much because of the shock value that surrounded them, but just how relevant his work is still today.  As homosexuality becomes a staple in our community and society, Lenny's comments on the teachers in this film seemed like topics we are still talking about today.  He was way ahead of his time, and I think that is why people feared him.  Living with an English teacher, I am constantly involved with the English language, but I am also shown information about those that have no interest because they do not see how it relates to ""real"" life.  I am also aware of how little respect English gets as daily we hear of schools cutting back on their Literature studies to help support their sports program, or how the first way to cut back spending is to close libraries.  These are sad days that we live in, and if only people could see how powerful words can be in defending yourself and explaining the world, I think we would see a rebirth.  If I had the option to fight with a loaded gun or an aggressive dictionary, I think you can see which I would choose.  Lenny Bruce did no harm to anyone, he spoke his mind, and for that he was convicted.  What a sad day for America.Grade: ***** out of *****",5,If you believe they put a man on the moon...,1103241600,"12 17, 2004",2004,4764,"['went', 'film', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'comic', 'Lenny', 'Bruce', 'watching', 'film', 'have', 'already', 'added', 'two', 'CDs', 'Wish', 'List', 'am', 'eager', 'hear', 'more', 'listen', 'words', 'be', 'intrigued', 'how', 'thoughts', 'are', 'still', 'relevant', 'today', 'society', 'was', 'beautiful', 'film', 'made', '1974', 'decision', 'director', 'Bob', 'Fosse', 'film', 'completely', 'black', 'white', 'was', 'brilliant', 'Hoffman', 'Perrine', 'chemistry', 'brilliant', 'as', 'well', 'performances', 'power', 'man', 'vividly', 'demonstrated', 'film', 'leaving', 'questions', 'answered', 'as', 'well', 'desire', 'hear', 'more', 'was', 'such', 'captivating', 'feature', 'opening', 'sequence', 'words', 'spewing', 'mouth', 'final', 'shot', 'Lenny', 'Bruce', 'was', 'glued', 'seat.To', 'begin', 'cinematography', 'was', 'better', 'most', 'feature', 'films', 'Fosse', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'did', 'greatest', 'ease', 'choice', 'film', 'completely', 'black', 'white', 'really', 'helped', 'hear', 'words', 'Bruce', 'spoke', 'instead', 'just', 'being', 'involved', 'colors', 'surrounded', 'black', 'white', 'feature', 'gave', 'Hoffman', 'ability', 'create', 'human', 'character', 'take', 'away', 'Hoffman', 'mind', 'comic', 'Lenny', 'Bruce', 'shots', 'Fosse', 'used', 'also', 'assisted', 'building', 'compelling', 'story', 'shot', 'important', 'film', 'Fosse', 'great', 'job', 'demonstrating', 'explaining', 'why', 'where', 'scene', 'was', 'first', 'only', 'nonmusical', 'was', 'triumphant', 'way', 'story', 'pseudo-documentary', 'style', 'was', 'impeccable', 'are', 'never', 'quite', 'told', 'who', 'person', 'camera', 'do', 'get', 'raw', 'emotion', 'actors', 'were', 'watching', 'real', 'documentary', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'emotion', 'Fosse', 'pulled', 'troupe', 'film', 'could', 'only', 'watch', 'amazement', 'also', 'left', 'door', 'open', 'question', 'who', 'camera', 'words', 'Bruce', 'said', 'nightly', 'show', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'possibility', 'government', 'conspiracy', 'Maybe', 'am', 'way', 'there', 'was', 'aura', 'cover-up', 'film', 'Even', 'final', 'sequence', 'off', 'Powerful', 'cinematography', 'right', 'front', 'whom', 'do', 'have', 'center', 'camera', 'None', 'other', 'very', 'young', 'fresh', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'film', 'really', 'showcased', 'talents', 'had', 'several', 'films', 'one', 'brought', 'spotlight', 'thought', 'went', 'film', 'really', 'transformed', 'character', 'favorite', 'moments', 'Hoffman', 'Lenny', 'was', 'when', 'nurse', 'first', 'time', 'when', 'Honey', 'asking', 'money', 'when', 'Judge', 'sentence', 'now', 'instead', 'going', 'trial', 'vision', 'defeat', 'was', 'spectacular', 'see', 'film', 'why', 'Hoffman', 'considered', 'one', 'greats', 'Hollywood', 'Valerie', 'Perrine', 'also', 'young', 'actress', 'time', 'was', 'immaculate', 'portrayal', 'Honey', 'needs', 'go', 'history', 'books', 'Actresses', 'today', 'could', 'take', 'moment', 'two', 'learn', 'dramatic', 'actress', 'two', 'actors', 'really', 'brought', 'film', 'together', 'took', 'deep', 'life', 'radical', 'thinker', 'kept', 'nestled', 'deeply', 'shined', 'greatly', 'Academy', 'saw', 'too', 'BAM', 'Cinematography', 'BAM', 'award', 'winning', 'acting', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'final', 'BAM', 'How', 'Lenny', 'Bruce', 'Born', 'well', 'death', 'had', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'man', 'words', 'witnessed', 'film', 'mouth', 'shocked', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'shock', 'value', 'surrounded', 'just', 'how', 'relevant', 'work', 'still', 'today', 'homosexuality', 'staple', 'community', 'society', 'Lenny', 'comments', 'teachers', 'film', 'seemed', 'topics', 'are', 'still', 'talking', 'today', 'was', 'way', 'ahead', 'time', 'think', 'why', 'people', 'feared', 'Living', 'English', 'teacher', 'am', 'constantly', 'involved', 'English', 'language', 'am', 'also', 'shown', 'information', 'have', 'interest', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'how', 'real', 'life', 'am', 'also', 'aware', 'how', 'little', 'respect', 'English', 'daily', 'hear', 'schools', 'cutting', 'back', 'Literature', 'studies', 'help', 'support', 'sports', 'program', 'how', 'first', 'way', 'cut', 'back', 'spending', 'close', 'libraries', 'are', 'sad', 'days', 'live', 'only', 'people', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'powerful', 'words', 'can', 'be', 'defending', 'explaining', 'world', 'think', 'would', 'see', 'rebirth', 'had', 'option', 'fight', 'loaded', 'gun', 'aggressive', 'dictionary', 'think', 'can', 'see', 'would', 'choose', 'Lenny', 'Bruce', 'did', 'harm', 'anyone', 'spoke', 'mind', 'was', 'convicted', 'What', 'sad', 'day', 'America.Grade', '*****', '*****']",Lenny VHS
508692,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00000JZIM,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 1]","Except for the last paragraph the rest of this review was used to review the documentary ""Lenny Bruce: Without Tears"". The points made there apply here, for the most part, as well.Okay, the average black male kid on the average ghetto city block knows, and knows without blinking, and knows from some seemingly unspoken source deep within his genetic structure that the cards are stacked against him. That the cops, the courts, or some other part of the ""justice"" system will, eventually, come knocking at the door or grab him off the street for something, usually dope. The average Latino male kid on the average barrio city now knows pretty much knows that same thing, again usually on some bogus drug charge. And nowadays even young black and Latina women are getting that same message coded into their psyches. What is not encoded is for a white, Jewish comic guy who has an off-beat sense of humor and has something to say, sometimes something profound to say, to face that same music, anytime. That, my friends, is the Lenny Bruce story in a nutshell and forms the theme for this commentary.Really, I could leave the headline, taken from something Lenny Bruce said when he was in deep and surreal legal trouble back in the 1960s, and that would tell the tale here. Nevertheless the case of one off -beat comic who tried to ""go outside the envelope"" of the confines of safe, secure, no waves, post-World World II cultural expression is an object lesson for the rest of us. Being a little bit uppity, being a little too black or brown, or being a little too red could get you in more trouble than you can shake a stick at then, and now.On viewing this documentary my first impression was ""what is all the fuss about?"" At the vantage point, forty or fifty years after the events, it is hard to see what the so-called moral police of the day got in a dither over in Bruce's work. On any given day you can hear more lewdness, lunacy, and sheer vulgarity on ""talk"" radio or television than Lenny ever uttered. That, however, is the point. Lenny was the point man, the trenchant social critic cum comedian who is honored now after the fact, but was not while the heat was on.One of the highlights of this documentary is Lenny Bruce performing in various venues interspersed with ""talking head"" commentary by those who knew or interviewed him. The most interesting one is with jazz critic and social activist, Nat Hentoff, when Lenny is deep in trouble and has physically been ravished by his struggle. Kenneth Tynan, of 1950s San Francisco poetic fame, and Malcolm Muggridge add their somewhat bizarre two cents worth. As does Bruce fellow social critic, Mort Sahl.Throwing out the above names and discussing the time frame of Bruce's troubles brings one final point. Was Lenny, like Kerouac, Ginsberg, Burroughs and Tynan, part of the 1950s ""beat"" generation? Certainly he was part of the avant guarde back door jazz scene and miles in front of any one else in the Milton Berle/Sid Caesar 1950s comedy world. One of the commentators noted that Bruce was primarily an entertainer, a man trying to make a living at what he did best. That seems right. But whether he was ""beat"" or not, he certainly pushed the envelop. And that is part of his legacy, and worthy of honor by us.*****The commercial movie ""Lenny"", starring Dustin Hoffman as Lenny, delves more into the personal side of Lenny's life, including his various affairs with women, especially the one leading up to his marriage(his wife here played by Valerie Perrine who seems perfect in this languid, strangely alluring stripper role), his jones, and his sinking down as a person under the weight of all those things and the long arm of the law. Hoffman is strongest when he digs deep into the legal imbroglio of Bruce's life and when he does some of his stand-up routines although anyone who has watched the Bruce documentary will note that it is almost impossible to mimic Bruce's mannerisms successfully. But a well done job, nevertheless.",4,In The Halls Of Justice The Only Justice Is In The Halls,1272067200,"04 24, 2010",2010,3999,"['last', 'paragraph', 'rest', 'review', 'was', 'used', 'review', 'documentary', 'Lenny', 'Bruce', 'Tears', 'points', 'made', 'apply', 'here', 'most', 'part', 'well.Okay', 'average', 'black', 'male', 'kid', 'average', 'ghetto', 'city', 'block', 'knows', 'blinking', 'seemingly', 'unspoken', 'source', 'deep', 'genetic', 'structure', 'cards', 'are', 'stacked', 'cops', 'courts', 'other', 'part', 'justice', 'system', 'will', 'eventually', 'come', 'knocking', 'door', 'grab', 'off', 'street', 'something', 'usually', 'dope', 'average', 'Latino', 'male', 'kid', 'average', 'barrio', 'city', 'now', 'pretty', 'much', 'knows', 'same', 'thing', 'again', 'usually', 'bogus', 'drug', 'charge', 'nowadays', 'even', 'young', 'black', 'Latina', 'women', 'are', 'getting', 'same', 'message', 'coded', 'psyches', 'What', 'not', 'encoded', 'white', 'Jewish', 'comic', 'guy', 'who', 'off-beat', 'sense', 'humor', 'something', 'say', 'sometimes', 'something', 'profound', 'say', 'face', 'same', 'music', 'anytime', 'friends', 'Lenny', 'Bruce', 'story', 'nutshell', 'theme', 'commentary.Really', 'could', 'leave', 'headline', 'taken', 'something', 'Lenny', 'Bruce', 'said', 'when', 'was', 'deep', 'surreal', 'legal', 'trouble', 'back', '1960s', 'would', 'tell', 'tale', 'here', 'case', 'one', '-beat', 'comic', 'who', 'tried', 'go', 'envelope', 'confines', 'safe', 'secure', 'waves', 'post-World', 'World', 'II', 'cultural', 'expression', 'object', 'lesson', 'rest', 'Being', 'little', 'bit', 'uppity', 'being', 'little', 'too', 'black', 'brown', 'being', 'little', 'too', 'red', 'could', 'get', 'more', 'trouble', 'can', 'shake', 'stick', 'then', 'now.On', 'viewing', 'documentary', 'first', 'impression', 'was', 'what', 'fuss', 'vantage', 'point', 'forty', 'fifty', 'years', 'events', 'hard', 'see', 'what', 'so-called', 'moral', 'police', 'day', 'got', 'dither', 'Bruce', 'work', 'given', 'day', 'can', 'hear', 'more', 'lewdness', 'lunacy', 'sheer', 'vulgarity', 'talk', 'radio', 'television', 'Lenny', 'ever', 'uttered', 'however', 'point', 'Lenny', 'was', 'point', 'man', 'trenchant', 'social', 'critic', 'cum', 'comedian', 'who', 'honored', 'now', 'fact', 'was', 'not', 'heat', 'was', 'on.One', 'highlights', 'documentary', 'Lenny', 'Bruce', 'performing', 'various', 'venues', 'interspersed', 'talking', 'head', 'commentary', 'who', 'knew', 'interviewed', 'most', 'interesting', 'one', 'jazz', 'critic', 'social', 'activist', 'Nat', 'Hentoff', 'when', 'Lenny', 'deep', 'trouble', 'physically', 'been', 'ravished', 'struggle', 'Kenneth', 'Tynan', '1950s', 'San', 'Francisco', 'poetic', 'fame', 'Malcolm', 'Muggridge', 'add', 'somewhat', 'bizarre', 'two', 'cents', 'worth', 'Bruce', 'fellow', 'social', 'critic', 'Mort', 'Sahl.Throwing', 'out', 'above', 'names', 'discussing', 'time', 'frame', 'Bruce', 'troubles', 'one', 'final', 'point', 'Was', 'Lenny', 'Kerouac', 'Ginsberg', 'Burroughs', 'Tynan', 'part', '1950s', 'beat', 'generation', 'Certainly', 'was', 'part', 'avant', 'guarde', 'back', 'door', 'jazz', 'scene', 'miles', 'front', 'one', 'else', 'Milton', 'Berle/Sid', 'Caesar', '1950s', 'comedy', 'world', 'One', 'commentators', 'noted', 'Bruce', 'was', 'primarily', 'entertainer', 'man', 'trying', 'make', 'living', 'what', 'did', 'best', 'right', 'was', 'beat', 'not', 'certainly', 'pushed', 'envelop', 'part', 'legacy', 'worthy', 'honor', '*****The', 'commercial', 'movie', 'Lenny', 'starring', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Lenny', 'more', 'personal', 'side', 'Lenny', 'life', 'including', 'various', 'affairs', 'women', 'especially', 'one', 'leading', 'up', 'marriage', 'wife', 'here', 'played', 'Valerie', 'Perrine', 'who', 'perfect', 'languid', 'strangely', 'alluring', 'stripper', 'role', 'jones', 'sinking', 'down', 'person', 'weight', 'things', 'long', 'arm', 'law', 'Hoffman', 'strongest', 'when', 'deep', 'legal', 'imbroglio', 'Bruce', 'life', 'when', 'stand-up', 'routines', 'anyone', 'who', 'watched', 'Bruce', 'documentary', 'will', 'note', 'almost', 'impossible', 'mimic', 'Bruce', 'mannerisms', 'successfully', 'well', 'done', 'job', 'nevertheless']",Lenny VHS
508693,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00000JZIM,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Biopics come and go, and actors take on legendary faces and win Oscars all the time, but what sets a real great biopic apart from the pack is a vision; a unique and gifted way of storytelling that makes it all feel more natural, organic and impactful.&#8216;Lenny&#8217; has that.The film is sharp from start to finish and contains a brilliant performance by Dustin Hoffman who not only captures the sheer wit and comedic timing of Lenny Bruce, but unravels his emotional layers with ease and dominance.  His chemistry with Valerie Perrine is also blessed and helps keep our attention streamlined to where it needs to be.  Fosse made a lot of smart choices here, and filming it in black and white was one of them.  The grit that envelops the film helps us to put into place the realities of Lenny&#8217;s life and not forget that this is a drama about a comic and not the other way around.  Bruce&#8217;s career and his tumultuous relationships as well as the way that his message as an artist was so ahead of the times are strong factors in this film and help flesh out a top notch biopic that feels alive, fresh and original.

508694,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B00000JZIM,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 4]","This is the story of Lenny Bruce. You should know that when I was in college I lived in a co-op named Lenny Bruce House. We used to joke that he was the founder of the house, but of course he probably never even knew about it. Still, it gave me a connection to Lenny Bruce, and I had at least one of his comedy albums. In the days before You Tube, comedians did stand up acts in clubs and they made talking record albums.This is a depressing movie in much the same way that ""Lady Sings the Blues"" was. Our entertainers are especially vulnerable to drug addiction, it's the world they live in, and the pressures under which they perform. But it doesn't make watching the stories of their lives any more pleasant.The story is told in a series of interviews with the people closest to him: his wife Honey (Valerie Perrine), his agent and his mother. They each tell the story from their own point of view, and so we get to see Lenny through a variety of eyes. There are also several scenes of him doing his club act, interacting with the audience and, inevitably, the cops, judges, attorneys and so forth that eventually drove him to overdose. Whether that overdose was a suicide or not was never conclusively determined.Honey was a stripper when Lenny met her, and he was a beginning stand-up comic and not very funny. He was also not controversial yet, and the two are clearly related. Watching the development of his act, it is clear he did not start to move his audiences until he got involved in attempting to shock them. He accidentally shocked some people by saying something to the band when he did not realize the microphone was live. The manager of the club insisted he should apologize. So he did, and then quit by saying he was going to piss on the audience. (It is not shown whether he did in fact piss.)Honey found Lenny cute and funny and smart, and crazy in love with her. She was as flattered as any woman would be, even one as beautiful as she was at the time. After a giddy, whirlwind courtship, he proposed and they were married. Then he took her home to meet his mother.Mom was a stand-up comic herself in her day, on the borscht circuit in the Catskills. She gave Lenny his first break by having him stand in for an MC in one of her shows when the MC didn't show up. She started by telling the audience he was the funniest guy in the world, when he'd never been on stage before in his life! So she tells this story to Honey, while the sour old aunt keeps asking, ""So how long did you and Lenny know each other before you were married?"" Finally, Honey says it was just hours, and they make a big joke of it at the old aunt's expense.For awhile, Honey worked a duo act with Lenny, but it didn't work out too well. Also, she started doing heroin. Then she went back to stripping to support her habit, and eventually she and Lenny got divorced. Their little girl was one year old at the time. Lenny got custody, Honey went to Hawaii, where she was busted for possession again. She spent some two years in prison there. In the interview later, she said that the year after she got out of the Hawaiian prison and went back with Lenny, she was busted 13 times. One wonders how she got off from one charge to the next in order to have time to be busted that often.A lot of things are not clear in this movie, including when Lenny was or was not doing drugs, what the sequence of events was with regard to his criminal cases, and so on. That's one of the problems with the interview and flashback format. But one thing that struck me was that after the first charge of obscenity, where Lenny got off because a jury said what he had said and done was not obscene, he started reading transcripts of his trials to his audiences and commenting on them. Finally, he was not funny, he was obsessed.The most tragic scene of all was when he was stoned out of his mind, wearing nothing but a trench coat, and went on stage to ramble and rage and eventually apologize for not being funny. As he went back to his dressing room, he was arrested for drugs.Dustin Hoffman does a great job in this movie, and so does Valerie Perrine.

508699,A134C1XKITZT0J,B00000JZIM,"Brian ""beejay46""","[6, 6]","A powerful biography of the brilliant but doomed night-club comedian Lenny Bruce. Taking the form of a pseudo documentary, an unseen interviewer questions Bruce's wife, mother, and agent about his life. We are shown  Bruce's early 50's beginnings as an unremarkable comic performing hackneyed  material. He then meets Honey Harlow, the stripper who becomes his wife.  Their marriage is happy at first. Then they get involved with drugs and  swinging, which cause problems and they eventually divorce. This first half  of the film uses the effective technique of frequently cutting to one of  Bruce's later performances to illustrate how these experiences inspired  some of his routines. Meanwhile, during a period working as an MC in strip  joints, Bruce develops the improvisational style for which he became  famous. He moves back to the nigh-clubs, wher his daring satire brings him  acclaim and (initially) fortune. Eventually the authorities take notice,  and he is subjected to a string of busts for obscenity and drugs, which  make it increasingly difficult to get work. Bruce's legal and money  problems pile up, and he finally dies of a drugs overdose. In some ways  then, Lenny is a typical Hollywood rags-to-riches-to-rags biopic, but here  spiced up with a liberal dose of 70's permissiveness. Its sparse Black and  white photography effectively compliments Bruce's increasing despair. The  supporting cast are all good, and Valerie Perrine is particularly strong as  Bruce's wife. But it is Dustin Hoffman who dominates the film. His  performance as Bruce is compelling, especially in the night-club scenes.  Precious little film exists of the real Lenny Bruce in live performance.  Watching Hoffman recreate his routines is the next best thing.

The film is (loosely) based on the play, which rather faithfully followed the life of Lenny Bruce (more or less) and told his story using entirely his own words. In the stage version, Lenny was played by Cliff Gorman, whose best known role was that of the wildly effeminate character Emory in both the film and original stage productions of Mart Crowley's play the Boys in the Band.  At the time, I ran out and purchased everything I could find on Lenny Bruce, because Cliff Gorman was that funny.  I laughed so hard in the theatre, I thought I'd die, and had trouble deciding what was more important, Lenny Bruce's status as one of the funniest comedians who ever lived, or the amazing social commentary woven throughout his routines. At the time, I remember thinking that Lenny Bruce was more of a philosopher or even a potential cult religious leader than a comedian. He had a knack of exposing hypocrisy, be it in politics, organized religion, race relations or whatever. I was convinced, at the tender age of 18, that Lenny Bruce had the keys, if not the answers, to all of the world's problems.I went out and purchased the cast album of the Broadway show, which consisted of a 2 LP recording of a complete live performance of the play.  I spent hours comparing Cliff Gorman to the real Lenny Bruce, and each time I listened to either, I memorized one of Lenny's hysterically funny bits. When I listened to records of the real Lenny Bruce, I marveled at how perfectly Cliff Gorman had reproduced his persona.  The rapid-fire delivery, the inflection, even the tonal quality of his voice and the exact pauses in his speech were there.  It was like Lenny Bruce had been reincarnated as Cliff Gorman.  I had trouble deciding if this was great acting or just a good impersonation, and in the end decided it didn't matter, for the material in Lenny seemed to capture the real Lenny Bruce.  That was good enough for me.When the film was announced, and I'd heard that Dustin Hoffman had been chosen to play Lenny, I was thrilled.  As a fan of Mr. Hoffman, I was sure he could do great justice to both the man and the material.  By the time the picture was completed, I had learned almost as much about Lenny Bruce's life as I ever would, and was familiar with probably 80% of his most famous routines.  The Masked Man, Christ and Moses, Las Vegas Tits and Ass, Airplane Glue, Ike and Nixon, Jackie Kennedy - I knew a lot of these by heart.  Some of them I memorized cold, and found that when people mentioned his name at parties or family gatherings, and someone invariably asked who he was, rather than explain his life or what he died of, all I had to do was recite one of his bits.  I never had a single person who was new to his material that didn't pronounce him awesome (as the kids say nowadays) on the spot.I don't remember what film I was watching (it was 31 years ago) when I first saw a trailer for the film, but as soon as I saw a clip of Dustin Hoffman as Lenny I knew something was wrong.  I had a sinking feeling that I wasn't going to like the movie bio of what was now my favorite comedian, but I went to see it anyway, as soon as it opened, hoping my gut instinct was wrong.  The cinematography was stunning.  The direction was first rate.  The story was fairly faithful to the life and spirit of Lenny Bruce, and Dustin Hoffman did as good an acting job as I'd ever seen.  All of the bits were there, and so was a fairly faithful rendering of his professional life.  So what was the problem?  The problem was simply that Dustin wasn't funny.  Those were Lenny Bruce's words and Lenny Bruce's life, but the jokes fell flat.  I came to the conclusion that no matter how skilled he is as an actor, Dustin Hoffman is no comedian.  He certainly was no Lenny Bruce.  Where was the lightning timing I was used to from the Cliff Gorman and Lenny Bruce recordings?  Mr. Hoffman seemed very unsure of his material, and delivered all the routines at what seemed like half-speed.  It was almost like he was a 45 RPM record being played at 33 1/3.  I wanted to reach into his mouth and pull the words out, and shout at the screen, ""You've got it all wrong!  This is too somber and too slow and too...unfunny to be Lenny Bruce"".  Worse, Mr. Hoffman had the annoying habit (which Lenny never did) of laughing at his own jokes.  Not loud guffaws mind you, just chuckles.  Constant chuckles, almost to himself, which left me with the impression that he thought that he was the only one who got the material.I bought the VHS when it came out several years later and watched it faithfully, hoping that as an older and wiser person, maybe I would find things in Mr. Hoffman's performance that I missed in 1974.  I wanted it to click.  No such luck.  I then dutifully purchased the DVD, as I have always purchased ""new"" Lenny Bruce recording or, lately videos, never tiring of his delivery or his message.  Again, I hoped that time had been kind to the portrayal I had so looked forward to in 1974.  But I screened it recently, and the film still leaves me cold, despite the best of intentions, the flawless direction and the great production values.  Icon, philosopher, cult leader or genius, if nothing else, Lenny Bruce was funny.  And Dustin Hoffman was not.",3,"Unfortunately, Not Very Funny",1133740800,"12 5, 2005",2005,5335,"['first', 'exposure', 'world', 'Lenny', 'Bruce', 'was', 'Broadway', 'show', 'Lenny', 'film',

What helps matters is that it's black and white, which is easier to clean up in the post production process. Really though, it looks like it could have been filmed last year. Dustin Hoffman channels Lenny Bruce in a film directed by Bob Fosse. Yes it's a weird thing, there's no denying that. Bob Fosse, who was better known for his choreography (Chicago, Cabaret), turned to directing as another outlet of his creative forces. As for Hoffman, looking at his body of work makes this role in particular standout. I'm surprised that he chose to play Bruce, an outspoken, angry man. After all, Hoffman is usually more the weirdo or mealy-mouthed villain. Then again, what was Bruce if not a slightly weird guy, who ultimately was shy except when he inhabited the stage.Lenny Bruce was the driving force behind making comedy into the socially challenging medium it is today. The structure is episodes of his life tied together with commentary from his agent, his wife (played by Valerie Perrine), and other important characters in his life. Lenny was one of the original dirty mouthed comedians, but with a point. He was taking on the establishment, and the hypocrisy of contemporary society. He was arrested and tried several times on obscenity charges, for things like using the word c**sucker during a public performance. He also had a problem with drug abuse, largely due to the influence of his addict wife. She was a headline stripper when they met, and he was a young comedian. Bruce died never really seeing the fruits of his passion.Fosse was an accomplished director, managing to channel some mavericks of his own in the direction of this movie. With its loose cutting style and drifting camera, the film at points feels like a Cassavete's film and this style works perfectly with the subject matter. Because of this, Lenny has a pure authenticity that's impossible to shake. There never feels like a false moment and Hoffman is particularly great (he was nominated for this role.) All of Lenny's acts are performed nearly verbatim, and all the court and interview transcripts are pulled from his life. Given that Bruce was a man under constant surveillance while he performed, so that the recordings could be used against him in court, allowing these same words to redeem him is Lenny's greatest accomplishment. Even if he doesn't know it, Lenny was right all along. I honestly enjoyed this film and like to thank JoeyD. for recommend it to me.",4,"Lenny Bruce was not only first, but he was different.",1194912000,"11 13, 2007",2007,2506,"['film', '30', 'years', 'old', 'great', 'What', 'matters', 'black', 'white', 'easier', 'clean', 'up', 'post', 'production', 'process', 'Really', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'last', 'year', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Lenny', 'Bruce', 'film', 'directed', 'Bob', 'Fosse', 'Yes', 'weird', 'thing', 'denying', 'Bob', 'Fosse', 'who', 'was', 'better', 'known', 'choreography', 'Chicago', 'Cabaret', 'turned', 'directing', 'outlet', 'creative', 'forces', 'Hoffman', 'looking', 'body', 'work', 'role', 'particular', 'standout', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'chose', 'play', 'Bruce', 'outspoken', 'angry', 'man', 'Hoffman', 'usually', 'more', 'weirdo', 'mealy-mouthed', 'villain', 'Then', 'again', 'what', 'was', 'Bruce', 'not', 'slightly', 'weird', 'guy', 'who', 'ultimately', 'was', 'shy', 'when', 'inhabited', 'stage.Lenny', 'Bruce', 'was', 'driving', 'force', 'making', 'comedy', 'socially', 'challenging', 'medium', 'today', 'structure', 'episodes', 'life', 'tied', 'together', 'commentary', 'agent', 'wife', 'played', 'Valerie', 'Perrine', 'other', 'important', 'characters', 'life', 'Lenny', 'was', 'one', 'original', 'dirty', 'mouthed', 'comedians', 'point', 'was', 'taking', 'establishment', 'hypocrisy', 'contemporary', 'society', 'was', 'arrested', 'tried', 'several', 'times', 'obscenity', 'charges', 'things', 'using', 'word', 'c**sucker', 'public', 'performance', 'also', 'had', 'problem', 'drug', 'abuse', 'largely', 'due', 'influence', 'addict', 'wife', 'was', 'headline', 'stripper', 'when', 'met', 'was', 'young', 'comedian', 'Bruce', 'died', 'never', 'really', 'seeing', 'fruits', 'passion.Fosse', 'was', 'accomplished', 'director', 'managing', 'channel', 'mavericks', 'own', 'direction', 'movie', 'loose', 'cutting', 'style', 'drifting', 'camera', 'film', 'points', 'feels', 'Cassavete', 'film', 'style', 'perfectly', 'subject', 'matter', 'Lenny', 'pure', 'authenticity', 'impossible', 'shake', 'never', 'feels', 'false', 'moment', 'Hoffman', 'particularly', 'great', 'was', 'nominated', 'role', 'Lenny', 'acts', 'are', 'performed', 'nearly', 'verbatim', 'court', 'interview', 'transcripts', 'are', 'pulled', 'life', 'Given', 'Bruce', 'was', 'man', 'constant', 'surveillance', 'performed', 'recordings', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'court', 'allowing', 'same', 'words', 'redeem', 'Lenny', 'greatest', 'accomplishment', 'Even', ""n't"", 'know', 'Lenny', 'was', 'right', 'all', 'along', 'honestly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'thank', 'JoeyD', 'recommend']",Lenny VHS

Shot in realistic black and white,the stark depiction of his life will always serve as a reminder that he did more for free expression than most artists of his day...Coming at a time when the beats were melting into the hippies,Bruce was indeed a counterculture hero to many whose effect radically changed the way America and it's intelligentsia saw themselves..From the early days of Miles Davis music floating throughout the movie and his days in Jewish New York, Bruce's desire to transcend his safe origins and take risks fed into this need for constant reassurance and a sense of success in his days coming to terms with 1950's USA. The drug use and the infidelities were real yet somehow sympathy exists for artists such as Bruce later popularized by writers such as Norman Mailer and even in movies like Raging Bull where the hero takes a fall either through self delusion or the success thrown on them.The personal insecurities were at times portrayed in the movie as an escape into hedonism but more often like a shot of morphine as an antidote to pain, whether self caused,real or imagined...Bruce came of age with his new found converts,the silent majority as it seems, behind him, his children remained and pushed him into the current cultural landscape of America..where he would be without them is a tough call ...criminal?madman?prophet?anarchist?pervert? he is beyond category (perhaps like us all) and that is why we can only get glimpses at anyone's biography whether written or on film.His life fell apart and he self destructed. Always willing to tear down the veils of hypocritical morality...Lenny Bruce knew what is and what should be are two different things.He played hard,defied the system,paid the price and goes down in history as a key cultural figure.This is not a documentary nor a romantic opportunity at hero worship but a very realistic look at a man who was certainly one of the key figures that shaped popular culture whose effectsare still to be felt and was ahead of his time in his total stream of consciousness.The DVD has 2 sides both wide and a standard screen version and serves a great historical purpose in understanding the era.",5,Sometimes You Need Hollywood To Authenticate A Posthumous Cultural Icon,1136160000,"01 2, 2006",2006,2662,"['One', 'great', 'movies', 'character', 'depiction..Hoffman', 'real', 'Honey', 'wife', 'come', 'pretty', 'real..Whether', 'loved', 'hated', 'true', 'authentic', 'man', 'was', 'funny', 'unmasking', 'morality', 'only', 'philosopher', 'can..What', 'laid', 'down', 'legacy.where', 'tragedy', 'come', 'well', 'movie', 'points', 'wife', 'indeed', 'great', 'man', 'woman', 'then', 'movie', 'can', 'certainly', 'debunk', 'myth..a', 'little', 'creative', 'tension', 'OK', 'return', 'heroin', 'Shot', 'realistic', 'black', 'white', 'stark', 'depiction', 'life', 'will', 'always', 'serve', 'reminder', 'did', 'more', 'free', 'expression', 'most', 'artists', 'day', 'Coming', 'time', 'when', 'beats', 'were', 'melting', 'hippies', 'Bruce', 'was', 'indeed', 'counterculture', 'hero', 'many', 'effect', 'radically', 'changed', 'way', 'America', 'intelligentsia', 'saw', 'early', 'days', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'music', 'floating', 'movie', 'days', 'Jewish', 'New', 'York', 'Bruce', 'desire', 'transcend', 'safe', 'origins', 'take', 'risks', 'fed', 'need', 'constant', 'reassurance', 'sense', 'success', 'days', 'coming', 'terms', '1950', 'USA', 'drug', 'use', 'infidelities', 'were', 'real', 'yet', 'somehow', 'sympathy', 'exists', 'artists', 'such', 'Bruce', 'later', 'popularized', 'writers', 'such', 'Norman', 'Mailer', 'even', 'movies', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'where', 'hero', 'fall', 'self', 'delusion', 'success', 'thrown', 'them.The', 'personal', 'insecurities', 'were', 'times', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'escape', 'hedonism', 'more', 'often', 'shot', 'morphine', 'antidote', 'pain', 'self', 'caused', 'real', 'imagined', 'Bruce', 'came', 'age', 'new', 'found', 'converts', 'silent', 'majority', 'children', 'remained', 'pushed', 'current', 'cultural', 'landscape', 'America..where', 'would', 'be', 'tough', 'call', 'criminal', 'madman', 'prophet', 'anarchist', 'pervert', 'category', 'perhaps', 'why', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'glimpses', 'anyone', 'biography', 'written', 'film.His', 'life', 'fell', 'apart', 'self', 'destructed', 'Always', 'willing', 'tear', 'down', 'veils', 'hypocritical', 'morality', 'Lenny', 'Bruce', 'knew', 'what', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'are', 'two', 'different', 'things.He', 'played', 'hard', 'defied', 'system', 'paid', 'price', 'down', 'history', 'key', 'cultural', 'figure.This', 'not', 'documentary', 'romantic', 'opportunity', 'hero', 'worship', 'very', 'realistic', 'look', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'certainly', 'one', 'key', 'figures', 'shaped', 'popular', 'culture', 'effectsare', 'still', 'be', 'felt', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'total', 'stream', 'consciousness.The', 'DVD', '2', 'sides', 'wide', 'standard', 'screen', 'version', 'great', 'historical', 'purpose', 'understanding', 'era']",Lenny VHS

Valerie Perrine, as Honey, his stripper wife is gorgeous.  His performance, judged as obscene, would be fairly tame today (but remember, this was the '60's).  The authorities used this as a pretext to shut him up (much like they'd use the &quot;Patriot Act&quot; today) because his political comments hit too close to home.  A great movie about a funny, controversial, but ultimately sad figure and the end leaves some speculation as to whether Mr. Bruce's death was a suicide or an overdose.  Anyway, great movie, but not one for the younger kids (although probably they've already heard and seen enough on tv, in music; particularly rap, and in other media that [as stated earlier] to make anything in this movie seem tame).

508719,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00000JZIM,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[3, 6]","Dustin Hoffman is Lenny Bruce - controversial loudmouth, frequent defendant and doomed icon.  By now, we all know that Lenny Bruce was famous for making people laugh at hearing things they didn't want to hear (as long as they weren't middle-aged white men involved in law enforcement).  Bruce earned the adoration of fans even as his routines and addictions brought him into repeated contact with the police.  Surprisingly, despite his eager exploration at the dark side of everything, Bruce manages to achieve some real happiness - finding love with a similarly off-center stripper (a very pre-""Can't Stop the Music"" Valerie Perrine), and even triumphing (eventually) in one of his prosecutions.The film is presented in verite black and white, and tells the story of Bruce through interviews with the people who knew him - Perrine, his lawyers, his promoters and agents.  The light is low, hinting of the gloomy circumstances that have made the story of Bruce's life a subject of such interest.  Most of the characters looks as if they were interviewed in dark closets or on darkened stages.  The film slyly suggests we can recognize the villains and heroes of Bruce's story according to how grieved they are in reliving his tortured life.  By the end, Bruce was stretched too thin by additional brushes with the law and problems both medical and financial.This flick is actually full of surprises.  For one thing, we've got the fragility of Bruce's heroic faade.  Though resolute in the face of the establishment on stage, Lenny seems to come apart when facing obscenity charges.  Bruce spoke to an America full of people ready to go to jail to speak their mind on civil rights or against the war, but Dustin Hoffman's Lenny is terrified of going to prison.  Facing certain conviction, he becomes snippy - his routines degenerate into monologues about his trials.  Another surprise is Bruce's feelings about obscenity.  Though he knows he's pushing the envelope, Hoffman's Bruce doesn't think himself obscene, and takes it personally when others describe him that way (especially during his trials when police officers' testimony essentially requires that they give their version of his act - you're spoiling the act! He yells at them).  Hoffman's Bruce isn't looking to fight for the right to be obscene - merely to stretch the bounds of what's acceptable; he struggles for a chance to perform his routine for the court, knowing he can prove that he's not obscene.  In the end, all is futile, and the law takes away the one thing Bruce can't afford to lose - his words.Though showing many faces of Lenny Bruce, the flick seems to be missing Bruce's biggest target: himself Bob Fosse directed both this and his own semi-autobiographical ""All That Jazz"".  While you can see that both films share a common vision, self disparagement seems something Fosse saves for the latter film (""Jazz"" seemed to have a double-helping of it; now we know where it came from).  The film never has Bruce question his own substance abuse problems which wrecked his health and brought him further closer to prison.  Neither does the later Bruce - the one closer to the end - even seem to acknowledge those he loved, those he must have known would feel the most pain when he was gone.  Fosse seems so resolute to show how weak and non-iconic Lenny Bruce really was that he misses the chance to show how human he could have been.",4,The Bruce you thought you knew,1042588800,"01 15, 2003",2003,3408,"['Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Lenny', 'Bruce', 'controversial', 'loudmouth', 'frequent', 'defendant', 'doomed', 'icon', 'now', 'know', 'Lenny', 'Bruce', 'was', 'famous', 'making', 'people', 'laugh', 'hearing', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear', 'as', 'long', 'were', ""n't"", 'middle-aged', 'white', 'men', 'involved', 'law', 'enforcement', 'Bruce', 'earned', 'adoration', 'fans', 'even', 'routines', 'addictions', 'brought', 'repeated', 'contact', 'police', 'Surprisingly', 'eager', 'exploration', 'dark', 'side', 'everything', 'Bruce', 'achieve', 'real', 'happiness', 'finding', 'love', 'similarly', 'off-center', 'stripper', 'very', 'pre-', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Stop', 'Music', 'Valerie', 'Perrine', 'even', 'triumphing', 'eventually', 'one', 'prosecutions.The', 'film', 'presented', 'verite', 'black', 'white', 'story', 'Bruce', 'interviews', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'Perrine', 'lawyers', 'promoters', 'agents', 'light', 'low', 'hinting', 'gloomy', 'circumstances', 'have', 'made', 'story', 'Bruce', 'life', 'subject', 'such', 'interest', 'Most', 'characters', 'were', 'interviewed', 'dark', 'closets', 'darkened', 'stages', 'film', 'slyly', 'can', 'recognize', 'villains', 'heroes', 'Bruce', 'story', 'according', 'how', 'grieved', 'are', 'reliving', 'tortured', 'life', 'end', 'Bruce', 'was', 'stretched', 'too', 'thin', 'additional', 'brushes', 'law', 'problems', 'medical', 'financial.This', 'flick', 'actually', 'full', 'surprises', 'one', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'got', 'fragility', 'Bruce', 'heroic', 'faade', 'resolute', 'face', 'establishment', 'stage', 'Lenny', 'come', 'apart', 'when', 'facing', 'obscenity', 'charges', 'Bruce', 'spoke', 'America', 'full', 'people', 'ready', 'go', 'jail', 'speak', 'mind', 'civil', 'rights', 'war', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Lenny', 'terrified', 'going', 'prison', 'Facing', 'certain', 'conviction', 'snippy', 'routines', 'degenerate', 'monologues', 'trials', 'surprise', 'Bruce', 'feelings', 'obscenity', 'pushing', 'envelope', 'Hoffman', 'Bruce', ""n't"", 'think', 'personally', 'when', 'others', 'describe', 'way', 'especially', 'trials', 'when', 'police', 'officers', 'testimony', 'essentially', 'give', 'version', 'act', ""'re"", 'spoiling', 'act', 'Hoffman', 'Bruce', ""n't"", 'looking', 'fight', 'right', 'be', 'obscene', 'merely', 'stretch', 'bounds', 'what', 'acceptable', 'chance', 'perform', 'routine', 'court', 'knowing', 'can', 'prove', 'not', 'obscene', 'end', 'futile', 'law', 'away', 'one', 'thing', 'Bruce', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'lose', 'words.Though', 'showing', 'many', 'Lenny', 'Bruce', 'flick', 'be', 'missing', 'Bruce', 'biggest', 'target', 'Bob', 'Fosse', 'directed', 'own', 'semi-autobiographical', 'Jazz', 'can', 'see', 'films', 'share', 'common', 'vision', 'disparagement', 'something', 'Fosse', 'latter', 'film', 'Jazz', 'seemed', 'have', 'double-helping', 'now', 'know', 'where', 'came', 'film', 'never', 'Bruce', 'question', 'own', 'substance', 'abuse', 'problems', 'wrecked', 'health', 'brought', 'further', 'closer', 'prison', 'later', 'Bruce', 'one', 'closer', 'end', 'even', 'seem', 'acknowledge', 'loved', 'must', 'have', 'known', 'would', 'feel', 'most', 'pain', 'when', 'was', 'gone', 'Fosse', 'so', 'resolute', 'show', 'how', 'weak', 'non-iconic', 'Lenny', 'Bruce', 'really', 'was', 'chance', 'show', 'how', 'human', 'could', 'have', 'been']",Lenny VHS
