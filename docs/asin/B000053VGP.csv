They don't called this ""The Leg Fighters"" for nothing -- some incredible kick-oriented fights.  My version, the martial arts theater version, is full screen but isn't bad.  Picture is clear but not ultra-crisp.  I imagine there is an original language version of this, but with this version you only get the English dub.  For many, this will be a deal-breaker, since the dubbing is often laughable and very bad (some of the characters seem to speak a 'pigeon-English,' and one character - Ding Dong - seems to be dubbed by Yogi Bear -- no joke!).  If you look past the dubbing, the story is nothing extraordinary, so you'll want to watch this mainly for the fighting.  Not a 5 star movie (not if we're comparing it to ""The 36 Chambers of Shaolin"" or ""The Chinese Connection), but not bad either.

566137,A3QTB346UKG6TV,B000053VGP,Mantis,"[1, 1]","Super kicking Korean sensation Dorian Tan Tao Ling (""Showdown at the Cotton Mill"") plays righteous Northern Kung Fu master Tan Hai Chi.  He is challenged by a man (Peng Kong) who refuses to admit defeat and tries to slice his way to victory.  In self-defense, Tan kills the man.  The man's cronies go back to tell the departed's brother (Peng Kong, again) that Tan killed his sibling.Meanwhile, spoiled girl Phoenix (Ha Kwong Li, ""Killer B's"") ignores her kung fu master (Sun Jung Chi, the carnivorous monk from ""Shaolin Vs Lama""), preferring to pal around with fellow student (Chin Lung) and get into trouble.  When the master's wife becomes sick, the master asks Tan Hai Chi to teach her.  She refuses his instruction and (with the help of Chin Lung) tries repeatedly to get rid of him.  When nothing works, she runs away and immediately gets into trouble, which Tan Hai Chi bails her out of.  She decides to accept him and trains hard.  Peng Kong's goons eventually find her new master for the inevitable showdown.Good production and decent story are marred by too many stupid and unnecessary characters coupled with fight choreography that is interesting and complex but, more often than not, far too slow.  That being said, it's not awful, and it has a bit of an indescribable charm to it.  I did enjoy watching it, but not enough to recommend.  Peng Kong's ground fighting is impressive, and his fight with Sun Jung Chi is a lot of fun.  Phoenix has some pretty flashy and flexible moves herself.Tai Seng's Martial Arts Theater once again delivers a fullscreened DVD with an English dub and no subtitles.  I'm fine with the dub, but I like having the option of original language.  On the off-chance that I become a huge fan of the movie, I might want to see what I missed in the translation.

566139,APIW11UEPKIC2,B000053VGP,"morgoth ""we lamas are traditional enemies of ...","[2, 2]","Peng Kong plays 2 roles in this movie. He plays the lead villian and also the lead villian's brother who fights Dorian Tan at the start of the movie. You will notice the fighting seems extremely unique and fluid and it for sure lives up to it's title suggesting it will be a leg fighting movie. Now, not only does Peng Kong star in the movie, but he also does the action choreography and you may recognize his work from 'Shaolin vs. Lama'. If you liked the sublime action in that movie then get ready for more awesome choreography including Peng Kong's unique use of Chinese wrestling. There is no doubt co-action director Sun Jung Chi had a hand in this unique style used. Ground kicking is a devastating technique and Peng Kong shows it off brilliantly. You can tell how different it is from other movies you usually see. He wasn't trying to bring the same old stuff just revved up and with better performers, he created his own choreography style and it produced a few of the best kung fu movies ever. This movie hasn't left my DVD player for a few days now. It's very hard to put into words how great the choreography is in this flick. Just truly amazing.Sun Jung Chi stars as a kung fu teacher/school teacher who instructs a young girl named Phoenix played by leg specialist Ho Kwong-li. She and her servant (Chin Lung) usually just play around. Phoenix really doesn't like to practice her kung fu since she thinks her training is too difficult but she loves to get into fights with anyone she meets. Veteran character actor Wong Hap ('Super Inframan') plays her father and lets her master leave to take care of his wife when she falls ill. His student, played by Dorian Tan (named Tan Hai Chi in the movie) takes over as her teacher. Phoenix and her servant are of course more than happy to see their master off but Tan Hai Chi is just as strict.Now you are going to get about an hour into this movie and say, ""this is not good kung fu, it is ok, but nothing special"". So the Ding Dong and Dong Dong brothers obviously aren't that great but there a few noteworthy fights that you will watch over and over again because of the extreme complexity. It took me about 30 minutes to finally stop rewinding the first fight and opening credits of the movie and finally just watch it. It is kind of a boring movie with a lot of campy fun but FINALLY 65 minutes in Peng Kong comes looking for revenge on Tan Hai Chi and finds his master(Sun Jung Chi), who as mentioned above also plays Phoenix's master earlier in the movie before he went to care for his wife. You may remember Sun Jung Chi as the crazy monk in 'Shaolin Vs. Lama'. He also played the musclebound teacher in 'Monkey Fist, Floating Snake'. Like Chang Shan, he was not in a lot of movies but was usually the best thing about anything he was in. He is very muscular but his fists are lightning fast, his kicks are awesome, and the way he does flips and jumps all over the place makes him almost unmatched as a kung fu performer on screen. His fight with Peng Kong is great but sadly that is all we get from him. He is criminally underused and it is sad to see since he was in so few movies, especially playing an actual role. Chin Lung was also very underused but he did good in his comedic servant role. Now the final fight is the reason the movie gets 4 stars. If the movie as a whole was just a bit better and had more quality fight like this it would have easily gotten a 5 star rating. Peng Kong puts on one of the greatest performances in kung fu cinema history. The unique fighting style he used could not have been put to better use and it is just one of those fights that you will have to watch maybe 20 times before you finally get your fill of it. I don't think I have ever seen a guy throw his body around quite like this. He makes some of those amazing types of moves that will make you cry out with excitement. I can't even imagine what this would have been like to see at one of the old grindhouses back in the day.Lee Tso-Nan has done many movies much better than this one but only a couple can come close to matching this finale.This is not a great movie and it has way too much stupid comedy but it is one of my personal favorites for the insanely awesome kung fu action.The picture quality from Tai Seng is pretty good. It starts out very speckled but cleans up remarkably. The full screen format actually doesn't affect it too much. Like Joseph Kuo, Lee Tso-Nan knew how to shoot everything right in the center of the screen. He was an amazing kung fu film maker.",4,"""When all this is over, Tan Hai Chi, I will kick your head off and put it on my brother's grave!""",1170460800,"02 3, 2007",2007,4542,"['Peng', 'Kong', '2', 'roles', 'movie', 'lead', 'villian', 'also', 'lead', 'villian', 'brother', 'who', 'Dorian', 'Tan', 'start', 'movie', 'will', 'notice', 'fighting', 'extremely', 'unique', 'fluid', 'sure', 'up', 'title', 'suggesting', 'will', 'be', 'leg', 'fighting', 'movie', 'Now', 'not', 'only', 'Peng', 'Kong', 'star', 'movie', 'also', 'action', 'choreography', 'may', 'recognize', 'work', ""'Shaolin"", 'vs.', 'Lama', 'liked', 'sublime', 'action', 'movie', 'then', 'get', 'ready', 'more', 'awesome', 'choreography', 'including', 'Peng', 'Kong', 'unique', 'use', 'Chinese', 'wrestling', 'doubt', 'co-action', 'director', 'Sun', 'Jung', 'Chi', 'had', 'hand', 'unique', 'style', 'used', 'Ground', 'kicking', 'devastating', 'technique', 'Peng', 'Kong', 'off', 'brilliantly', 'can', 'tell', 'how', 'different', 'other', 'movies', 'usually', 'see', 'was', ""n't"", 'trying', 'bring', 'same', 'old', 'stuff', 'just', 'revved', 'up', 'better', 'performers', 'created', 'own', 'choreography', 'style', 'produced', 'few', 'best', 'kung', 'fu', 'movies', 'ever', 'movie', ""n't"", 'left', 'DVD', 'player', 'few', 'days', 'now', 'very', 'hard', 'put', 'words', 'how', 'great', 'choreography', 'flick', 'Just', 'truly', 'amazing.Sun', 'Jung', 'Chi', 'kung', 'fu', 'teacher/school', 'teacher', 'who', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Phoenix', 'played', 'leg', 'specialist', 'Ho', 'Kwong-li', 'servant', 'Chin', 'Lung', 'usually', 'just', 'play', 'around', 'Phoenix', 'really', ""n't"", 'like', 'practice', 'kung', 'fu', 'training', 'too', 'difficult', 'get', 'fights', 'anyone', 'Veteran', 'character', 'actor', 'Wong', 'Hap', 'Inframan', 'father', 'master', 'leave', 'take', 'care', 'wife', 'when', 'ill.', 'student', 'played', 'Dorian', 'Tan', 'named', 'Tan', 'Hai', 'Chi', 'movie', 'over', 'teacher', 'Phoenix', 'servant', 'are', 'course', 'more', 'happy', 'see', 'master', 'Tan', 'Hai', 'Chi', 'just', 'as', 'strict.Now', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'hour', 'movie', 'say', 'not', 'good', 'kung', 'fu', 'ok', 'nothing', 'special', 'Ding', 'Dong', 'Dong', 'Dong', 'brothers', 'obviously', 'are', ""n't"", 'great', 'few', 'noteworthy', 'fights', 'will', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'extreme', 'complexity', 'took', '30', 'minutes', 'finally', 'stop', 'rewinding', 'first', 'fight', 'opening', 'credits', 'movie', 'finally', 'just', 'watch', 'kind', 'boring', 'movie', 'lot', 'campy', 'fun', 'FINALLY', '65', 'minutes', 'Peng', 'Kong', 'looking', 'revenge', 'Tan', 'Hai', 'Chi', 'master', 'Sun', 'Jung', 'Chi', 'who', 'mentioned', 'also', 'Phoenix', 'master', 'earlier', 'movie', 'went', 'care', 'wife', 'may', 'remember', 'Sun', 'Jung', 'Chi', 'crazy', 'monk', ""'Shaolin"", 'Vs.', 'Lama', 'also', 'played', 'musclebound', 'teacher', ""'Monkey"", 'Fist', 'Floating', 'Snake', 'Chang', 'Shan', 'was', 'not', 'lot', 'movies', 'was', 'usually', 'best', 'thing', 'anything', 'was', 'very', 'muscular', 'fists', 'are', 'lightning', 'fast', 'kicks', 'are', 'awesome', 'way', 'flips', 'jumps', 'place', 'almost', 'unmatched', 'kung', 'fu', 'performer', 'screen', 'fight', 'Peng', 'Kong', 'great', 'sadly', 'get', 'criminally', 'underused', 'sad', 'see', 'was', 'so', 'few', 'movies', 'especially', 'playing', 'actual', 'role', 'Chin', 'Lung', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'underused', 'did', 'good', 'comedic', 'servant', 'role', 'Now', 'final', 'fight', 'reason', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'movie', 'whole', 'was', 'just', 'bit', 'better', 'had', 'more', 'quality', 'fight', 'would', 'have', 'easily', 'gotten', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'Peng', 'Kong', 'one', 'greatest', 'performances', 'kung', 'fu', 'cinema', 'history', 'unique', 'fighting', 'style', 'used', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'better', 'use', 'just', 'one', 'fights', 'will', 'have', 'watch', 'maybe', '20', 'times', 'finally', 'get', 'fill', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'guy', 'throw', 'body', 'quite', 'amazing', 'types', 'moves', 'will', 'make', 'cry', 'out', 'excitement', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'imagine', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'see', 'one', 'old', 'grindhouses', 'back', 'day.Lee', 'Tso-Nan', 'done', 'many', 'movies', 'much', 'better', 'one', 'only', 'couple', 'can', 'come', 'close', 'matching', 'finale.This', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'stupid', 'comedy', 'one', 'personal', 'favorites', 'insanely', 'awesome', 'kung', 'fu', 'action.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'Tai', 'Seng', 'pretty', 'good', 'out', 'very', 'speckled', 'up', 'remarkably', 'full', 'screen', 'format', 'actually', ""n't"", 'affect', 'too', 'much', 'Joseph', 'Kuo', 'Lee', 'Tso-Nan', 'knew', 'how', 'shoot', 'everything', 'right', 'center', 'screen', 'was', 'amazing', 'kung', 'fu', 'film', 'maker']",N/A
