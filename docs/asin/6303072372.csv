When I was younger, I was a fan of the Francis films, and watched whenever they came on TV back in the Fifties.When I found this one,it was like discovering an old friend and finding that though times had changed,it didn't lessen my appreciation for the films-or my enjoyment when I saw them again.",5,Stargazer,1199750400,"01 8, 2008",2008,402,"['When', 'i', 'watched', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'was', 'still', 'as', 'funny', 'remembered', 'be', 'When', 'was', 'younger', 'was', 'fan', 'Francis', 'films', 'watched', 'whenever', 'came', 'TV', 'back', 'Fifties.When', 'found', 'one', 'was', 'discovering', 'old', 'friend', 'finding', 'times', 'had', 'changed', 'did', ""n't"", 'lessen', 'appreciation', 'films-or', 'enjoyment', 'when', 'saw', 'again']",Francis Joins the WACS VHS

354376,A2PAKB0NYQLCSG,6303072372,Scott MacGillivray,"[5, 5]","Newspaper critics in '54 said this was the funniest Francis... and  they were right. Donald O'Connor plays the mule's pal a bit more broadly than usual, and the script situations are amusing (you can imagine the complications when O'Connor is drafted into the Women's Army Corps by mistake). One of the best bits has Francis heckling the cast members when O'Connor has to masquerade as a WAC nurse -- it's very funny. Chill Wills dubs the mule's dialogue expertly, and you'll be amazed at how good the synchronization is when Francis talks. A fine cast helps: Lynn Bari, Julia Adams, Mamie Van Doren, and especially the fluttery ZaSu Pitts. The video opens with the original coming-attractions trailer, but it gives away some of the jokes, so the viewer might fast-forward past this part. Picture is excellent, sound is very good (a few parts sounded a little thin but still listenable).
