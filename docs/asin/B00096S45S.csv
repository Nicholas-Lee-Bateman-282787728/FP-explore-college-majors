It's still great to watch. The cast is excellent (even though they only pictured Brosnam at the cover, which shows how much they try to milk a cow when they find one - as if Zimbalist wasn't as important to the show as Brosnam). James Read (from North and South, and lately Charmed) also performs great.The scripts are well written - funny and interesting.As for the release, the video quality is fair (not excellent, but not complaints either). One of the episodes has a slight audio desync (noticeable, but not really annoying). I can't tell if this happened in the original broadcast, though.The box is slim, which I appreciate (real state in my DVD shelf is a scarce resource), however the DVDs are double-sided, which I don't like, since they are easier to damage.All in all, I think this makes a good release (with a decent price), and if you are a fan of the show or want to get this for a fan, you won't be dissapointed.",4,"Pretty good release, and the show didn't get old",1125100800,"08 27, 2005",2005,1140,"['Just', 'watched', 'last', 'episode', 'set', 'am', 'making', 'effort', 'not', 'writing', 'review', ""'m"", 'done', 'often', 'once', 'finds', 'surprises', 'such', 'cut', 'episodes', '.First', 'must', 'say', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'old', 'still', 'great', 'watch', 'cast', 'excellent', 'even', 'only', 'pictured', 'Brosnam', 'cover', 'how', 'much', 'try', 'milk', 'cow', 'when', 'find', 'one', 'Zimbalist', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'important', 'show', 'Brosnam', 'James', 'Read', 'North', 'South', 'lately', 'Charmed', 'also', 'great.The', 'scripts', 'are', 'well', 'written', 'funny', 'interesting.As', 'release', 'video', 'quality', 'fair', 'not', 'excellent', 'not', 'complaints', 'One', 'episodes', 'slight', 'audio', 'desync', 'noticeable', 'not', 'really', 'annoying', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'happened', 'original', 'broadcast', 'though.The', 'box', 'slim', 'appreciate', 'real', 'state', 'DVD', 'shelf', 'scarce', 'resource', 'however', 'DVDs', 'are', 'double-sided', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'are', 'easier', 'damage.All', 'think', 'good', 'release', 'decent', 'price', 'are', 'fan', 'show', 'want', 'get', 'fan', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'dissapointed']",N/A

902242,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B00096S45S,Bobby Underwood,"[141, 146]","This was a truly stylish television show that tapped into the kind of Stanley Donen light mystery romance that is missing from the movies today. Pierce Brosnan and Stephanie Zimbalist were perfectly cast and the show only got better with each episode. The Henry Mancini theme music captured the feel of this light and sophisticated show tinged with humor perfectly. It was as evocative and as much a part of the show as his ""Peter Gunn"" theme had been decades before.Laura Holt (Zimbalist) couldn't get her private detective agency off the ground in spite of her skills until she invented the phantom agency head, Remington Steele. Business was booming and everything was going swell until Pierce Brosnan shows up and assumes the roll of the nonexistent Steele, both around town and with clients. An uneasy alliance was formed that to the delight of fans moved more and more towards the romantic as time went by.Brosnan's Steele was debonair and stylish, his past a shady mystery ala' ""To Catch a Thief."" Each season Laura discovered new things about his past in Ireland and his exploits in other countries. Steele was also a film buff and would make constant references to films of the 1930's and 1940's he would recall pertaining to the case. It made all us film buffs who knew just what he was talking about feel like we were insiders, and was one of the many charms of this wonderful show.Brosnan and Zimbalist were a terrific screen couple in the tradition of all those ones we remember fondly. One could say they were our generations Nick and Nora Charles. There was a fun anticipation for viewers as week after week we watched the two become involved in a mystery while they danced around their growing affection for each other. And it was always fun as little tidbits of Steele's past were discovered by Laura.This series was fun and sophisticated and always left you feeling good. This kind of entertaining film is missing from today's teen driven box office. It is also missing from the ""reality"" driven television we see so much of today. Remington Steele filled a void left for those seeking the kind of fun escapism which all but disappeared when the Hollywood studio system began to collapse.Remington Steele was something really special in television. Every one of the episodes was enjoyable and finally, after years of waiting, the first season of this truly fantastic show is being released. Every lover of classic films was in love with this show. It was a refreshing reminder of what television could, and should be.

The plots are entertaining, actually mysterious, fun and still fresh today.  The chemistry between the stars is unbeatable (I always heard they didn't get along well in real life).  Pierce Brosnan had great comedic talent, but still with a tough side.  It's fun to see him before his Bond days.  Stephanie Zimbalist was one of the best actresses of her generation, and beautiful as well.The show prgressed pretty well over the 4 seasons it ran.  The first season was kind of experimental, and had a few too many regular characters.  The later formula of Steele, Laura and Mildred worked a lot better, but season one is still great fun and has good stroy lines.

902244,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B00096S45S,Brent Butler,"[3, 3]","Often the first season of a uniquely concepted TV series is the most ""pure"". Sometimes it is also not the strongest, as actors and characters have a chance to grow and the series thereby grows and becomes more enjoyable. Very often the pilot is somewhat removed from what the series eventually becomes, as strategies for the story and its characters can change a lot between the pilot and what the network dictates that they want to see in the series.Only one of the above statements is true for the first season of Remington Steele. I would say that it is the most ""pure"" of the seasons in its devotion to the initial concept. That concept was nicely structured from the pilot on, and the characters were fully fleshed in that pilot and continued to be true to the initially designed roles.For anyone who doesn't know, the premise of the show was a lady who ran a detective agency and created a false male ""head of the agency"" to deflect the reluctance of any potential clients who might feel that a female detective could not get the job done. This fraud was discovered by a charming thief and confidence man who then stepped uninvited into the fake role. Thus, ""Remington Steele"" came to be flesh and blood, instead of just an office dodge. The initial concept was for the show to revolve around the real detective, Laura Holt. Later on the concept was modified to include having a ""fake fake"" step forward as Steele.The show was clever, funny, had interesting mysteries, and an always entertaining by-play between Laura and 'Remington', whose true identity we never do discover ... and as it turns out not even he knows it to be able to reveal it.This very clever plot idea became a very clever TV show.The DVD presentation is solid. The shows look and sound great ... probably they are a better presentation than you would have seen from the broadcast signal in the 80s. They really take us back to a very fun era of TV.Highly recommended.",5,A great start to a fun series,1316390400,"09 19, 2011",2011,1944,"['Often', 'first', 'season', 'uniquely', 'concepted', 'TV', 'series', 'most', 'pure', 'Sometimes', 'also', 'not', 'strongest', 'actors', 'characters', 'have', 'chance', 'grow', 'series', 'thereby', 'grows', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'Very', 'often', 'pilot', 'somewhat', 'removed', 'what', 'series', 'eventually', 'strategies', 'story', 'characters', 'can', 'change', 'lot', 'pilot', 'what', 'network', 'want', 'see', 'series.Only', 'one', 'above', 'statements', 'true', 'first', 'season', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'would', 'say', 'most', 'pure', 'seasons', 'devotion', 'initial', 'concept', 'concept', 'was', 'nicely', 'structured', 'pilot', 'characters', 'were', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'pilot', 'continued', 'be', 'true', 'initially', 'designed', 'roles.For', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'premise', 'show', 'was', 'lady', 'who', 'ran', 'detective', 'agency', 'created', 'false', 'male', 'head', 'agency', 'deflect', 'reluctance', 'potential', 'clients', 'who', 'might', 'feel', 'female', 'detective', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'fraud', 'was', 'discovered', 'charming', 'thief', 'confidence', 'man', 'who', 'then', 'stepped', 'uninvited', 'fake', 'role', 'Thus', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'came', 'be', 'flesh', 'blood', 'instead', 'just', 'office', 'dodge', 'initial', 'concept', 'was', 'show', 'revolve', 'real', 'detective', 'Laura', 'Holt', 'Later', 'concept', 'was', 'modified', 'include', 'having', 'fake', 'fake', 'step', 'forward', 'Steele.The', 'show', 'was', 'clever', 'funny', 'had', 'interesting', 'mysteries', 'always', 'entertaining', 'by-play', 'Laura', ""'Remington"", 'true', 'identity', 'never', 'do', 'discover', 'out', 'not', 'even', 'be', 'able', 'reveal', 'it.This', 'very', 'clever', 'plot', 'idea', 'became', 'very', 'clever', 'TV', 'show.The', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'solid', 'shows', 'look', 'sound', 'great', 'probably', 'are', 'better', 'presentation', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'broadcast', 'signal', '80s', 'really', 'take', 'back', 'very', 'fun', 'era', 'TV.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

902251,A5262SOTU4BXM,B00096S45S,"C. O'Hare ""Paris Writer""","[1, 1]","I enjoyed watching season one because of the great ENSEMBLE cast of Stephanie Zimbalist, James Read, and Janet DeMay, as well as newcomer Pierce Brosnan. Stephanie has a natural energy that she put in her character, Laura. The premise of the show is that Stephanie's character creates Remington Steele and is the brains behind the man. The dialogue is very clever and nicely delivered by all. Some of the plots are a little confusing and unconvincing, but overall I've enjoyed the shows enough to be on my third viewing.Personally, I thought James was hotter than Pierce and less stiff. I liked how their characters bickered. Janet's character, Bernice, could have handled more challenge in the storylines; she has the personality and flair for it. I wish more could have been given to these two actors on the series.I was disappointed with the box art for season 1. Only Pierce is on the front. Perhaps this is why she participates in none of the extras on the season 1 DVD. Why is she, the other star of the series, not also featured in the interviews, as well as getting on the FRONT of the DVD box and cases?The box does not contain pictures of James or Janet either, who were active co-stars in the first season. Doris Roberts, who does not appear in season 1, merits being in a small picture with Stephanie on the back of one of the season 1 DVD cases. All the pictures of Stephanie on the season 1 box are are small.

902252,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B00096S45S,Cubist,"[11, 13]","Private detective TV shows were all the rage in the 1980s: Hart to Hart, Simon and Simon, Moonlighting and, of course, Remington Steele which introduced North American audiences to actor Pierce Bronsan. As originally conceived, Remington Steele was about a female private investigator named Laura Holt (Zimbalist) having trouble being taken seriously because she's woman so, she creates a very masculine alter ego as a front. However, that was it and NBC told the show's creators, Michael Gleason and Robert Butler, that they needed to flesh out this flimsy premise. They decided to have the alter ego be an actual flesh and blood person. Enter Brosnan and the rest, as they say, was history.If Moonlighting had a Howard Hawksian screwball comedy vibe than Remington Steele went for a Nick and Nora in The Thin Man (1934) feel that is reminiscent of Classic Hollywood cinema. Laura is a smart, shrewd individual fighting hard to get respect in a male-dominated profession. Steele is her ideal foil as the suave, charmer. She doesn't put up with his B.S. but is intrigued by his charisma and intelligence. There is sexual tension between them right from the first episode and like Moonlighting later on, the fun of watching the show is anticipating if and when Laura and Steele will finally hook up.Pierce Brosnan is well-cast as the unflappable Steele, complete with cultured Irish accent and impeccably tailored-suits. Watching Brosnan in this show it is easy how he became James Bond. He displays all the qualities ideal for that role in this show. In fact, he would've become Bond earlier if he wasn't contractually obligated to do Steele.Stephanie Zimbalist brings a plucky charm to her role as the smart private eye who wants to be judged on her own merits but finds that the Steele faade works a little too well - especially when he demonstrates an aptitude for the investigative process.Like Moonlighting, Remington Steele lost steam gradually over subsequent seasons (the final episode aired on February 17, 1987) but the first one captures the show in its prime before the storylines got too ridiculous. Watching it now, after all these years, makes one nostalgic for that era when reality shows were non-existent and TV programs were given room to breathe and develop an audience. Plus, it is fascinating to watch a young Brosnan in the role that made him a household name have so much fun with his character.The first DVD features an audio commentary on ""License to Steele"" by creators Michael Gleason and Robert Butler. They mention that the show's premise was of its time and would be hard to do today with reality shows about bounty hunters and so on.They also do a commentary for ""Tempered Steele."" This was actually the original pilot episode but NBC wanted them to do one that showed how Laura and Steele met. They tend to watch the episode which results in the occasional lull.""Remington Steele, Season One"" is a retrospective featurette that features new interview footage with Brosnan with Zimbalist conspicuously absent. This is an excellent if all-too brief look at the genesis of the show.The second DVD features a profile on the main cast members. The Steele character was patterned after Cary Grant: sophisticated and funny.On the third DVD is a featurette called ""Comedy and Old Movies."" The writers tried to ape the classic screwball comedies with fast, snappy dialogue and sexual tension. Steele was an avid film buff and referenced movies in almost every episode. They often took premises from old film noirs and incorporated them into the show.Finally, on disc four is an audio commentary on ""Vintage Steele"" with Gleason and writer Susan Baskin. She liked writing for the show because, for her, it was like writing classic comedies for the 1930s. Baskin wanted to explore Laura's past in this episode and speaks very eloquently about her intentions.",5,Nick and Nora for the '80s,1122940800,"08 2, 2005",2005,3880,"['Private', 'detective', 'TV', 'shows', 'were', 'rage', '1980s', 'Hart', 'Hart', 'Simon', 'Simon', 'Moonlighting', 'course', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'introduced', 'North', 'American', 'audiences', 'actor', 'Pierce', 'Bronsan', 'originally', 'conceived', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'was', 'female', 'private', 'investigator', 'named', 'Laura', 'Holt', 'Zimbalist', 'having', 'trouble', 'being', 'taken', 'seriously', 'woman', 'so', 'very', 'masculine', 'alter', 'ego', 'front', 'However', 'was', 'NBC', 'told', 'show', 'creators', 'Michael', 'Gleason', 'Robert', 'Butler', 'needed', 'flesh', 'out', 'flimsy', 'premise', 'decided', 'have', 'alter', 'ego', 'be', 'actual', 'flesh', 'blood', 'person', 'Enter', 'Brosnan', 'rest', 'say', 'was', 'history.If', 'Moonlighting', 'had', 'Howard', 'Hawksian', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'vibe', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'went', 'Nick', 'Nora', 'Thin', 'Man', '1934', 'feel', 'reminiscent', 'Classic', 'Hollywood', 'cinema', 'Laura', 'smart', 'shrewd', 'individual', 'fighting', 'hard', 'get', 'respect', 'male-dominated', 'profession', 'Steele', 'ideal', 'foil', 'suave', 'charmer', ""n't"", 'put', 'up', 'B.S', 'intrigued', 'charisma', 'intelligence', 'sexual', 'tension', 'right', 'first', 'episode', 'Moonlighting', 'later', 'fun', 'watching', 'show', 'anticipating', 'when', 'Laura', 'Steele', 'will', 'finally', 'hook', 'up.Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'well-cast', 'unflappable', 'Steele', 'complete', 'cultured', 'Irish', 'accent', 'impeccably', 'tailored-suits', 'Watching', 'Brosnan', 'show', 'easy', 'how', 'became', 'James', 'Bond', 'qualities', 'ideal', 'role', 'show', 'fact', 'would', ""'ve"", 'become', 'Bond', 'earlier', 'was', ""n't"", 'contractually', 'obligated', 'do', 'Steele.Stephanie', 'Zimbalist', 'plucky', 'charm', 'role', 'smart', 'private', 'eye', 'who', 'be', 'judged', 'own', 'merits', 'Steele', 'faade', 'little', 'too', 'well', 'especially', 'when', 'aptitude', 'investigative', 'process.Like', 'Moonlighting', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'lost', 'steam', 'gradually', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'final', 'episode', 'aired', 'February', '17', '1987', 'first', 'one', 'show', 'prime', 'storylines', 'got', 'too', 'ridiculous', 'Watching', 'now', 'years', 'one', 'nostalgic', 'era', 'when', 'reality', 'shows', 'were', 'non-existent', 'TV', 'programs', 'were', 'given', 'room', 'breathe', 'develop', 'audience', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'young', 'Brosnan', 'role', 'made', 'household', 'name', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'character.The', 'first', 'DVD', 'audio', 'commentary', 'License', 'Steele', 'creators', 'Michael', 'Gleason', 'Robert', 'Butler', 'mention', 'show', 'premise', 'was', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'do', 'today', 'reality', 'shows', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'so', 'on.They', 'also', 'do', 'commentary', 'Tempered', 'Steele', 'was', 'actually', 'original', 'pilot', 'episode', 'NBC', 'wanted', 'do', 'one', 'showed', 'how', 'Laura', 'Steele', 'met', 'tend', 'watch', 'episode', 'results', 'occasional', 'lull', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'Season', 'One', 'retrospective', 'featurette', 'new', 'interview', 'footage', 'Brosnan', 'Zimbalist', 'conspicuously', 'absent', 'excellent', 'all-too', 'brief', 'look', 'genesis', 'show.The', 'second', 'DVD', 'profile', 'main', 'cast', 'members', 'Steele', 'character', 'was', 'patterned', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'sophisticated', 'third', 'DVD', 'featurette', 'called', 'Comedy', 'Old', 'Movies', 'writers', 'tried', 'ape', 'classic', 'screwball', 'comedies', 'fast', 'snappy', 'dialogue', 'sexual', 'tension', 'Steele', 'was', 'avid', 'film', 'buff', 'referenced', 'movies', 'almost', 'episode', 'often', 'took', 'premises', 'old', 'film', 'noirs', 'incorporated', 'show.Finally', 'disc', 'four', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Vintage', 'Steele', 'Gleason', 'writer', 'Susan', 'Baskin', 'liked', 'writing', 'show', 'was', 'writing', 'classic', 'comedies', '1930s', 'Baskin', 'wanted', 'explore', 'Laura', 'past', 'episode', 'speaks', 'very', 'eloquently', 'intentions']",N/A

902255,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B00096S45S,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[52, 57]","Emblazoned across the cover for the Fox season one release of the popular 1980s show ""Remington Steele"" is a tagline that reads ""Before he was James Bond he was ... Remington Steele"" with a shot of reigning big-screen James Bond actor Pierce Brosnan in the title role. In fact, the actress who originally had top billing on the show, Stephanie Zimbalist, is nowhere in sight on any of the promotional materialS or final cover art.Such is the power of Hollywood marketing, for it was Brosnan, not Zimbalist, who became the break-out star for the show, with Brosnan receiving more fan mail than the studio had ever received before for a single actor.The plot for the fall 1982 show centered around Zimbalist's character Laura Holt who, as a female detective, found it impossible to be taken seriously (this was, after all, the early 1980s). In order to resolve this troubling set of circumstances, Holt invents a (as she puts it) ""decidedly masculine superior.""All seems to be going well until (in a quite obvious tip of the hat to 1959s ""North by Northwest"") the character appears in the shape of Pierce Brosnan, who answers a page for the fictitious Steele so that he can escape from two thugs.Assuming the role of Remington Steele on a permanent basis, Laura and he embark on a series of adventures that for this set are in the shape of 22 full-frame episodes that echo the plots of well-known classic mysteries-from ""Murder on the Orient Express"" to ""The Maltese Falcon"" to ""And Then There Were None,"" a personal favorite of mine.It was these intriguing mysteries and the one-upmanship banter between the two leads that makes the show such a joy to watch.CommentariesAs is most often the case with DVDs, the main special features are usually the commentaries; but truth be told, the first two commentaries in this set (on the first two episodes) are rather light on facts and heavy on silence.Contrary to what pre-release publicity might have you believe, Brosnan does not contribute to either of the commentaries. Here we have series creators Michael Gleason and Robert Butler. Unfortunately, the two appear to get caught up in the show and forget to leave comments for the audience.So what do we learn from the commentaries? Well, we learn that the image of Zimbalist wearing a fedora was a major selling point for the series. We also learn that the original pilot for the show was not the one that aired Oct. 1, 1982, named ""License to Steele.""Originally, ""Steele"" was to have started with what became the second episode, as execs just wanted to jump straight into the show. But then NBC changed its mind and decided it wanted to see the first meeting of Laura and Steele, so Gleason and Butler went back and wrote what was to become the pilot.In their commentary for the original pilot, called ""Tempered Steele,"" Butler is initially confused as he says they are watching the original pilot (before reshoots). Then he recognizes that they are watching the reshot version.More compelling is the third commentary between Gleason and writer Susan Baskin, which is hidden on the A-side of the fourth disc. Accompanying the episode ""Vintage Steele,"" Gleason and Baskin discuss character and story development, specifically the effort to flesh out the Holt character to counterbalance the mystery that was Remington Steele and Baskins attempts to inject more subtle comedic touches into the show.FeaturettesIncluded as background information to the series are three short featurettes that vary in length. Two of the featurettes are rather light in nature, with one tracking the development of main characters Remington, Laura, Bernice and Murphy. It is here that Brosnan refutes the long-held belief that he and Zimbalist had a mutual animosity toward one another, saying, ""People said we didn't get along, but we did get along quite well.""The shortest documentary on the set-clocking in at just under eight minutes-features writers Baskin and Andrew Lazkos discussing the use of comic timing in the series and their efforts to emulate the 1940s movies of Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn when writing the series.The main featurette (at 12-minutes) on the flip side of the first of the four discs includes a discussion with Gleason and Butler as well as an on-camera interview with Brosnan on the genesis of the show. Indeed the documentary may prove to surprise today's audience. Not yet a star-it would be 13 years until Brosnan would don the tuxedo as James Bond on the big screen-NBC loved Zimbalist but disliked the way Brosnan played the title character.As Brosnan recounts in his interview, that evening he went over the lines with his late wife Cassie and she asked, ""That's the way you are going to play it?""So Brosnan followed her subsequent advice and just played himself. NBC still was not happy, but producers Gleason and Butler stuck to their guns and NBC finally relented and gave the series the green light with an unknown British actor in the title role.Another surprise comes in the revelation that the original solo pitch for the series did not even feature the character of Remington Steele. It was a show about a female detective who invented Steele so she could get cases. It was Gleason who came up with the notion ""What if he turns up and drives her crazy?""It was only then that it became a duet.",5,I've seen the DVD set and its pretty sweet,1120003200,"06 29,

902261,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B00096S45S,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[11, 14]","The name is Steele. Remington Steele.Before the advent of reality TV and gritty cop shows, detective shows were apparently the thing -- and the 1980s show ""Remington Steele"" was a standout. The mixture of humor, romantic tension and high-gloss detecting is constantly entertaining.Laura Holt (Stephanie Zimbalist) worked hard to become a private eye, only to discover that sexism was holding her back. So she invented a fake boss, Remington Steele, who was always conveniently absent when clients came to talk to his ""assistant."" The deceptive little system works perfectly... until Laura tries to protect a multimillion-dollar jewel collection, and runs into a man (Pierce Brosnan) who now claims to be Remington Steele.The flesh-and-blood Remington Steele is dapper, intelligent, loves old movies, and is a master criminal. Laura can't expose him without exposing her own fraud, so she comes to a tenuous truce with him: She'll let him stay, and finance his apartment and living, if he behaves himself and doesn't mess around with her detecting. Her assistants Murphy and Bernice (James Read and Janet DeMay) don't like it, but they have to accept him.But Steele doesn't want to stay in the shadows. He begins to take an interest in solving cases, and helps Laura find a missing video game genius, deal with a body in a winery, and encounter the Yakuza, murderous fellow P.I.s, B-movie queens, smut publishers, insomniacs, old lovers, divorce lawyers, and much more. All the while, Laura tries to figure out who Steele really is, as they try to figure out how they feel about each other.Humorous detective stories are not an easy thing to do -- they can easily descend into slapstick or idiocy. ""Remington Steele"" straddled the line perfectly. The first two episodes are rather grim, but by episode three we have Brosnan's charming smirks and the slightly oddball cases that the show became known for. Okay, maybe Laura's on-the-run striptease was a bit much, but Steele's look of shock is worth it.Surprisingly, not much has aged about this show. Sure, we have some ludicrous 80s hair and clothing, and computers were in their infancy. But the storylines are still hugely entertaining, the sort of stories that could be easily transferred (well, most of the time) to the 1920s, 2000s, or most places in between.Pierce Brosnan, pre-Bond, gives Steele the right amounts of earnestness and smoothness, quoting old movies and enthusiastically needling Murphy. Zimbalist does an almost equal job; she gets a bit smug in some scenes, but overall carries it well as the Beatrice to Pierce's Benedick. The two stars have remarkably electric chemisty -- a shame they didn't like each other.DeMay and Read aren't as good -- they were only in one season -- primarily because their characters seem rather one note. And the various guest stars are very good, whether old ladies or distinguished actors, such as Zimbalist's father Efram Jr. And keep an eye out for a young Sharon Stone in a very brief role.A deeply entertaining and well-written series, ""Remington Steele"" managed to bridge the gulf between detective shows and dry comedy.

902267,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00096S45S,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[12, 12]","Yes, I was a kid growing up in the '80s and one of my favorite shows was the charming Remington Steele, which I actually preferred to Moonlighting. Pierce Brosnan was so cool and debonair and so dang British that I wanted to be like him. The fact that he was a con-man and had a mysterious past added to the mystique. And Lord, I had such a crush on Laura Holt, who was beautiful, clever, earnest, athletic and kinda prudish (turns out, our little Miss Prim & Proper had a few urges she firmly kept in check). Anyways, I'm a sucker for freckles. One of the best things about Season One was the ultra-cool theme song by the great Henry Mancini. The music exuded sheer class and sexiness and seemed to promise champagne and skullduggery. Another cool thing was the intro voice-over of Stephanie Zimbalist: ""Try this for a deep, dark secret. The great detective Remington Steele? He doesn't exist. I invented him. Follow..."" And so, we do.Skip this paragraph if you know the show's premise. Laura Holt is a very capable sleuth whose private investigative agency isn't drawing in the clients, mostly because she's a woman. So she invents a front man - a decidedly masculine superior - named Remington Steele (according to Laura, ""Remington"" is derived from a brand of typewriter, while ""Steele"" is from the Pittsburg Steelers). Soon, sure enough, clients are coming in droves. And then, one day, HE walked in. Episode one, License to Steele,  tells of the chance encounter between Laura Holt and a charming, urbane thief who steals her heart and, while he's at it, the name and identity of her agency.The show Remington Steele ushered in a short era of sophistication and sly humor that recalled the best of vintage Hollywood. Brosnan and Zimbalist may not have gotten along well in real life, but as Steele and Holt, they were a match made in heaven. The show was ably supported by the yearning Murphy (James Read), who never did get over his suspicions (not totally unfounded) about Steele, and the gum-chewing Bernice Fox (Janet DeMay), whose name Remington chose to not clearly remember, much to her annoyance. Too bad the powers-that-be decided Murphy and Bernice were in the way of Remington and Laura's blossoming romance; they were written out by season two.The mysteries themselves weren't all that original, more than a few being patterned after the plots of famous movies, which ties in nicely with Remington's penchant for quoting from Hollywood's golden age. But viewers didn't tune in for the quality of the mystery elements (don't get me wrong, they didn't suck), but rather - much like the classic Thin Man films - for the nova-intense chemistry between the two leads and their up-and-down romantic relationship. It would take a few seasons before their always-on-the-verge-but-never-quite-consumated flirtation became frustrating for the audience.This season is the first and by far the best. Highlight episodes of Season One are:License to Steele (episode 1) - Private eye Laura Holt is hired to protect some valuable, high profile jewelry, but an enigmatic (but very suave) British scam artist keeps popping up. Serious eye contact and innuendos are exchanged between the two, which later results in the con-man (who has his own problems) taking up the identity of the fictitious Remington Steele. Needless to say, a must see episode.Thou Shalt Not Steele (episode 5) - A woman (Cassandra Harris, Brosnan's real wife at the time) from Steele's mysterious past convinces Steele to steal a painting rumored to be cursed from a Los Angeles museum exhibit. Problem is, Laura had already contracted to protect the valuable painting. Fun episode with Remington and Laura dabbling in professional thieving. This is the debut of Felicia, Remington's ex-flame, who shows up again in season 4.In the Steele of the Night (episode 9) - Laura and Murphy attend a reunion party consisting of sleuths who used to work for the Havenhurst agency. One of the detectives is killed and Remington (who crashes the get-together) is elected to solve the murder. Very amusing, as Laura handfeeds clues to Remington, who attempts to look knowledgeable in front of his ""peers.""Steele Trap (episode 10) - This one channels Agatha Christie's classic And Then There Were None. Remington and Laura show up at a weekend bash on the private island of a smut magazine publisher. And then people start getting killed off one by one.Vintage Steele (episode 19) - Shenanigans in a winery and a recurring corpse. Laura stripteases and the two finally kiss. This is a cool episode and one of the most romantic. We finally find out stuff about Laura's past, specifically the reason why Laura doesn't like to mix business with pleasure.Steele's Gold (episode 20) - Remington, Laura, and Murphy follow a prospector's journal, hoping to unearth gold. Hijinks in a ghost town and a wild treasure hunt in the desert. Fun episode.Sting of Steele (episode 21) - The first sighting of Daniel Chalmers (Efrem Zimbalist Jr. - Stephanie's dad), Remington's mentor and surrogate dad, who shows up needing Steele's assistance in putting on an intricate sting to shake some villains off his back. Another vintage episode.This box set contains four discs with all 22 episodes. Special features contain three episode commentaries (License to Steele, Tempered Steele, and Vintage Steele), as well as several making-of featurettes and character bios.

We won't even mention the follow-up ""movies"" that comprised the final season. It's fun to watch this first season and see familiar faces from film and TV before they became stars, such as Annie Potts, Delta Burke, Sharon Stone, and Pierce Brosnan himself. Don't miss nepotism at its best with guest appearances by Stephanie Zimbalist's father, Efrem Zimbalist Jr, and Brosnan's first wife, Cassandra Harris.

902270,A3N0AXNEZVE686,B00096S45S,Hound Dog,"[1, 1]","Most casual fans of ""Remington Steele"" remember Pierce Brosnan & Stephanie Zimbalist, with co-star Doris Roberts, in a delightfully romantic mystery romp of female private eye Laura Holt teaming with a dashing con artist posing as her boss.  Accompanied by composer Henry Mancini's elegant theme music, this TV series has a timeless charm.  Yet, one shouldn't forget its initial season (1982-83), which co-starred James Read as sidekick detective Murphy Michaels and Janet Demay as receptionist Bernice Foxe.  These solid first season stories mostly are just as terrific as the series was in its prime (Seasons 2-4).Here are first season episodes especially worth repeat viewings:* ""License to Steele"": The pilot episode has a suave mystery man double-crossing Laura Holt's team and a pair of ruthless thugs over a collection of priceless South African diamonds at an automobile trade show.* ""In the Steele of the Night:"" Remington party-crashes Laura & Murphy's weekend reunion with several detective friends.  Highly recommended, this is perhaps the series' best mystery!* ""Steele Trap:"" Amusing and surprisingly tawdry (at least, for the early `80s), an undercover Remington and Laura are marooned on an island where a vengeful killer is eliminating a Playboy Mansion-like house party's guests one by one.* ""Steele Crazy After All These Years:"" Laura & Remington aid Murphy in catching another serial killer stalking Murphy's college reunion weekend.* ""Vintage Steele:"" A Steele screwball comedy classic reveals Laura's apparently wild past, as a mystery corpse repeatedly turns up at a vineyard.  It is one of our personal favorite, best-ever Steele episodes.Despite its promotional packaging, ""Remington Steele, Season One"" isn't just about a young Pierce Brosnan practicing to become James Bond someday.  Stephanie Zimbalist's performance as Laura Holt was definitely Emmy-caliber, as her facial reactions alone to Remington's antics are simply priceless.  Also, James Read's performance as Murphy often works nicely as a contrast to Laura & Remington.  A word of caution, though: of all 22 first season episodes, avoid the ""Steele's Gold"" episode.  It is a TV clich&eacute; quickly gone sour as our detective trio prospects for lost gold (Murphy's role is painful to watch).Considering Bernice Foxe was given so little to do, and if ""Steele's Gold"" is any indication of Murphy's presence, it made sense that the second season immediately saw their roles consolidated into Doris Roberts' IRS accountant-turned-receptionist Mildred Krebs.  Even so, the first season of ""Remington Steele"" ages exceptionally well (as compared to so many other `80s TV shows).  This DVD set is well worth an investment of your time, so enjoy the fun, romance, and mystery of ""Remington Steele.""Rating: 4.5/5 stars.

It was better!  If you were a fan of this show buy this dvd (and the rest as they become available), if you are new to the series get this and you soon will be.The basic premise of the show is that talented, ambitious detective Laura Holt discovered that the idea of a female private detective was too much for the times.  To overcome this sexist attitude she invented the very masculine Remington Steele as a cover while she did all the work.  Success soon followed and aided by co-conspiritors Murphy Michaels and Bernice Fox, Laura took the agency to the top.  As the series begins the agency has a very swank suite of offices, a seemingly unlimited cash flow and a very high profile case.  Then 'he walks in' a conman who realises that there is no Remington Steele and sees the opportunity to turn this to his own ends.The series is very reminiscent of the screwball comedies of the '30's and '40's.  Laura and Remington are very much like Nick and Nora Charles of the 'Thin Man' series with a touch of Tracy and Hepburn style.  The stories are well writen, cleverly plotted and keep the viewer guessing to the end.  There are various movies references scattered through either as plot devices, lines of dialogue or references that challenge the viewer to identify on subsequent viewings, and yes it is worth watching multiple times.The ensemble cast of the first season is delightful, Murphy and Bernice are sadly only in the first season and add so much to the story.  The 'families' are also introduced here, Laura's ex, her overbearing mother both appear and even her oh-so-perfect sister is alluded to, Remington's ex (Brosnan's wife Cassandra Harris)and his mentor (Zimbalist's father Efrem) both appear and shed a little light on his past.The extras in the dvd set are wonderful, the commentaries on the are definitely worth watching and give more insight into the series a treat for fans of the series.Now for the complaints.  First even though Doris Roberts did not  join the cast until the second season the unwary would never know it looking at the packaging.  Her picture appears mutiple times on while James Read's (Murphy Michaels) and Janet DeMay's (Bernice Fox) do not.  Most irritating of all though is that Stephanie Zimbalist, the 'big name star' when the series came out does not give a commentary to any of the episodes, is mentioned only in passing (mostly as looking good in hats) and is listed on the dvd cover as 'also starring'.

(stephanie zimbalist)and the mystery man (pierce brosnan - in his breakout role in the u.s.) make a deal, mystery man can play remington steele so long as he stays on the right side of the law and does nothingto mess up the running of the business. the series then sets about to give the viewers a number of years of good shows withthe type of writting that goes back to the thin man movies aslaura halt the p.i. & remington steele the mystery man not onlywork togeather but become much, much closer. in the end however,nbc could not make it's mind if it wanted the show or not, which in the end caused some uneven show + tv movies. in addition it did damage to everybody's career, as well as the additional punishment of giving us timothy dalton as ""james bond"".the bottom line however is that this show is proof of hollywoodand tv could if it was not always trying to come up with the newdaring, edgy show for 18 - 34 yr olds, and acted as if most viewers had a i.q. no bigger than their shoe size. i mean really, how many edgy, gritty crime shows like law & order 20 or c.s.i. 8 or reality shows showing half starved contestants eating bugs on some island can one stand before one pukes their guts out. as of now i only watch 2 broadcast network shows:enterprise - upn (it's final show will be on 05/13/05)24 --------- fox (with all the mau-mauing aboutthis seasonthe will be back for a 5th season)most everything else currently on broadcast tv is for thebrain dead and simply not worth watching. that is why i will addthis series to my growing dvd collection (400+ movies & mini series & broadcast series) - if only hollywood could create more shows like this - but don't count on itenjoy remington steele and see hollywood can be if it wanted to be",5,a good show gets to dvd at last,1113696000,"04 17, 2005",2005,2410,"['was', 'time', 'when', 'hollywood', 'tv', 'networks', 'nbc', 'cbs', 'abc', 'spent', 'time', 'money', 'put', 'shows', 'people', 'brains', 'however', 'mid', '80', 'number', 'shows', 'thatfit', 'profile', 'never', 'big', 'begin', 'was', 'getting', 'quite', 'small', 'show', 'was', 'one', 'last', 'idea', 'show', 'was', 'female', 'p.i', 'needed', 'create', 'fake', 'never', 'seen', 'male', 'boss', 'order', 'get', 'business', 'would', 'notother', 'get', 'just', 'was', 'woman', 'worked', 'quite', 'welluntil', 'mystery', 'man', 'very', 'shady', 'secret', 'past', 'shows', 'upstating', 'mystery', 'remington', 'steele', 'end', 'pilot', 'episode', 'female', 'p.i', 'stephanie', 'zimbalist', 'mystery', 'man', 'pierce', 'brosnan', 'breakout', 'role', 'u.s.', 'make', 'deal', 'mystery', 'man', 'can', 'play', 'remington', 'steele', 'so', 'long', 'right', 'side', 'law', 'nothingto', 'mess', 'up', 'running', 'business', 'series', 'then', 'give', 'viewers', 'number', 'years', 'good', 'shows', 'withthe', 'type', 'writting', 'back', 'thin', 'man', 'movies', 'aslaura', 'p.i', 'remington', 'mystery', 'man', 'not', 'onlywork', 'togeather', 'become', 'much', 'much', 'closer', 'end', 'however', 'nbc', 'could', 'not', 'make', 'mind', 'wanted', 'show', 'not', 'end', 'caused', 'uneven', 'show', '+', 'tv', 'movies', 'addition', 'did', 'damage', 'everybody', 'career', 'as', 'well', 'additional', 'punishment', 'giving', 'timothy', 'dalton', 'james', 'bond', 'bottom', 'line', 'however', 'show', 'proof', 'hollywoodand', 'tv', 'could', 'was', 'not', 'always', 'trying', 'come', 'up', 'newdaring', 'edgy', 'show', '18', '34', 'yr', 'olds', 'acted', 'most', 'viewers', 'had', 'i.q', 'bigger', 'shoe', 'size', 'i', 'mean', 'really', 'how', 'many', 'edgy', 'gritty', 'crime', 'shows', 'law', 'order', '20', 'c.s.i', '8', 'reality', 'shows', 'showing', 'half', 'starved', 'contestants', 'eating', 'bugs', 'island', 'can', 'one', 'stand', 'one', 'pukes', 'guts', 'out', 'now', 'only', 'watch', '2', 'broadcast', 'network', 'shows', 'enterprise', 'upn', 'final', 'show', 'will', 'be', '05/13/05', '24', 'fox', 'mau-mauing', 'aboutthis', 'seasonthe', 'will', 'be', 'back', '5th', 'season', 'most', 'everything', 'else', 'currently', 'broadcast', 'tv', 'thebrain', 'dead', 'simply', 'not', 'worth', 'watching', 'why', 'i', 'will', 'addthis', 'series', 'growing', 'dvd', 'collection', '400+', 'movies', 'mini', 'series', 'broadcast', 'series', 'only', 'hollywood', 'could', 'create', 'more', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'itenjoy', 'remington', 'steele', 'see', 'hollywood', 'can', 'be', 'wanted', 'be']",N/A

This is how James Bond would be as a teen. I remembered really liking this show. Well, over the years, this hasn't held up as well as I thought it would. TV today is written and acted so well, that it is impossible to compare the two eras. The real draw here is the warm fuzzy nostalgia factor.Don't get me wrong if you enjoyed the show then, you will have fun with this. Todays TV makes this show look a little pale in comparison. The modern day version of this show is White Collar on USA. If you watch the two side by side you can really see the simpler times of Remington Steele. R. Steele is done in the same light as Moonlighting with Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd. There is a little bit of a mystery, and then a zany chase scene at the end where the baddies are chased down while riding in something goofy like a golf or shopping cart.But, as with Moonlighting, the really treat is the dialogue bantering back and forth. Since the plots are tissue paper, dialogue had to be strong. It is hard to believe that these shows are now 30 years old, yes, 30.

902287,A2F3M93RRLFQNJ,B00096S45S,mrliteral,"[1, 2]","It was hardly a landmark TV series, but Remington Steele was one of the brighter spots in 1980s TV and remains one of the better light mystery shows.  And as demonstrated in the Season One set, it was good right off the bat.The premise is summarized in the opening credits.  Private eye Laura Holt was having no success in the business because no one would take a female investigator seriously.  To solve the problem, she created an imaginary male boss, Remington Steele.  It was a successful ruse until a con man came in and assumed Steele's identity; against her will, Laura had a real boss.The success of the show was with its two leads.  At the time the show debuted, Stephanie Zimbalist was the bigger name, the latest in a family of entertainers.  As Laura, she was both attractive and sensible, except when it came to Steele, who she undeniably attracted to.  The unknown actor playing Steele would be the one to go on to bigger things:  Pierce Brosnan, in the role that established him.It's not surprising that Brosnan would become famous in this role, since he constantly steals the show as the dashing but mysterious Steele, a man with an affection for old movies and a past filled with various acts of thievery and scams.  His affection for Laura, however, keeps him on the straight and narrow as he attempts to be an actual private eye himself.  Though he is not really an investigator, he does have skills that allow him to occasionally crack cases.What Brosnan brings to the show is demonstrated in the episode ""In the Steele of the Night"" in which (except for a very brief scene), Steele does not appear for the first ten or so minutes, leaving Laura (and partner Murphy played by James Read) to carry the show.  They do well enough, but the episode is just a routine mystery episode; when Steele enters, however, the show's energy picks up.Not every episode is perfect, but for the most part, these are fun to watch, the result of the creators' attempt to mimic an old-fashioned screwball comedy.  (It's not essential, but a good knowledge of old movies pays off for the viewers.).  Remington Steele may not be the best show ever, but it's plenty good enough to entertain most people.",5,Good comic mystery,1228521600,"12 6, 2008",2008,2200,"['was', 'hardly', 'landmark', 'TV', 'series', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'was', 'one', 'brighter', 'spots', '1980s', 'TV', 'one', 'better', 'light', 'mystery', 'shows', 'demonstrated', 'Season', 'One', 'set', 'was', 'good', 'right', 'bat.The', 'premise', 'summarized', 'opening', 'credits', 'Private', 'eye', 'Laura', 'Holt', 'was', 'having', 'success', 'business', 'one', 'would', 'take', 'female', 'investigator', 'seriously', 'solve', 'problem', 'created', 'imaginary', 'male', 'boss', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'was', 'successful', 'ruse', 'con', 'man', 'came', 'assumed', 'Steele', 'identity', 'will', 'Laura', 'had', 'real', 'boss.The', 'success', 'show', 'was', 'two', 'leads', 'time', 'show', 'debuted', 'Stephanie', 'Zimbalist', 'was', 'bigger', 'name', 'latest', 'family', 'entertainers', 'Laura', 'was', 'attractive', 'sensible', 'when', 'came', 'Steele', 'who', 'undeniably', 'attracted', 'unknown', 'actor', 'playing', 'Steele', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'go', 'bigger', 'things', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'role', 'established', 'not', 'surprising', 'Brosnan', 'would', 'become', 'famous', 'role', 'constantly', 'show', 'dashing', 'mysterious', 'Steele', 'man', 'affection', 'old', 'movies', 'past', 'filled', 'various', 'acts', 'thievery', 'scams', 'affection', 'Laura', 'however', 'straight', 'narrow', 'be', 'actual', 'private', 'eye', 'not', 'really', 'investigator', 'have', 'skills', 'allow', 'occasionally', 'crack', 'cases.What', 'Brosnan', 'show', 'demonstrated', 'episode', 'Steele', 'Night', 'very', 'brief', 'scene', 'Steele', 'not', 'appear', 'first', 'ten', 'so', 'minutes', 'leaving', 'Laura', 'partner', 'Murphy', 'played', 'James', 'Read', 'carry', 'show', 'do', 'well', 'enough', 'episode', 'just', 'routine', 'mystery', 'episode', 'when', 'Steele', 'enters', 'however', 'show', 'energy', 'picks', 'up.Not', 'episode', 'perfect', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'result', 'creators', 'attempt', 'mimic', 'old-fashioned', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'not', 'essential', 'good', 'knowledge', 'old', 'movies', 'viewers.', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'show', 'ever', 'plenty', 'good', 'enough', 'entertain', 'most', 'people']",N/A

This classy fusion of whodunits with romantic screwball humor was a welcome throwback to early films such as ""The Thin Man"" series. Which is appropriate since the title character--a die-hard cinephile--frequently used movie references to gain perspective on a current case. Stephanie Zimbalist (playing pretty but gritty & smart Laura Holt) and dashing Pierce Brosnan (so baby-faced here, and strolling into the role-of-a-lifetime of Remington Steele like a modern day Cary Grant) had (luckily) chemistry from the very beginning. Their on-again-off-again relationship as associate & boss would provide the framework throughout the entire series.That's not to say that the road didn't have its bumps as it suffered ""growing pains"": The supporting characters of associate Murphy (the handsome James Reade as sort of the blue collar flipside to Steele's character) & secretary Mrs. Fox (beautiful brunette Janet DeMay) just weren't going anywhere. Sure, Murphy's character had his occasional moments (Reade turned in a great comedy performance in ""Steele's Gold""), but he just seemed to be there to provide friction between Laura & Remington. And Fox was sadly underused (you only saw her briefly in the office).In spite of those exceptions (a happy change would come in Season Two), the die was cast for the series as Steele & Holt would bicker over a case one scene and kiss & make up the next.Kudos to 20th Century Fox for handsomely packaging this series, along with a ""making of"" featurette interviewing both cast & crew!",5,Steele beginnings,1297209600,"02 9, 2011",2011,1637,"['moment', 'caught', 'Episode', 'One', 'stylish', 'engaging', 'series', 'back', 'fall', ""'82"", 'was', 'instantly', 'hooked', 'classy', 'fusion', 'whodunits', 'romantic', 'screwball', 'humor', 'was', 'welcome', 'throwback', 'early', 'films', 'such', 'Thin', 'Man', 'series', 'Which', 'appropriate', 'title', 'character', 'die-hard', 'cinephile', 'frequently', 'used', 'movie', 'references', 'gain', 'perspective', 'current', 'case', 'Stephanie', 'Zimbalist', 'playing', 'pretty', 'gritty', 'smart', 'Laura', 'Holt', 'dashing', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'so', 'baby-faced', 'here', 'strolling', 'role-of-a-lifetime', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'modern', 'day', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'had', 'luckily', 'chemistry', 'very', 'beginning', 'on-again-off-again', 'relationship', 'associate', 'boss', 'would', 'provide', 'framework', 'entire', 'series.That', 'not', 'say', 'road', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'bumps', 'suffered', 'growing', 'pains', 'supporting', 'characters', 'associate', 'Murphy', 'handsome', 'James', 'Reade', 'sort', 'blue', 'collar', 'flipside', 'Steele', 'character', 'secretary', 'Mrs.', 'Fox', 'beautiful', 'brunette', 'Janet', 'DeMay', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'going', 'anywhere', 'Sure', 'Murphy', 'character', 'had', 'occasional', 'moments', 'Reade', 'turned', 'great', 'comedy', 'performance', 'Steele', 'Gold', 'just', 'seemed', 'be', 'there', 'provide', 'friction', 'Laura', 'Remington', 'Fox', 'was', 'sadly', 'underused', 'only', 'saw', 'briefly', 'office', 'spite', 'exceptions', 'happy', 'change', 'would', 'come', 'Season', 'Two', 'die', 'was', 'cast', 'series', 'Steele', 'Holt', 'would', 'bicker', 'case', 'one', 'scene', 'kiss', 'make', 'up', 'next.Kudos', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'handsomely', 'packaging', 'series', 'making', 'featurette', 'interviewing', 'cast', 'crew']",N/A
902294,A3BZSYJKZCRY03,B00096S45S,Retro Pixie,"[0, 0]","""Remington Steele"" is in the fashion of that rare genre - a combination romantic comedy/mystery.  It's akin to ""The Thin Man"" series.  There were a couple of these TV shows in the 80's that tapped into that genre, like ""Hart to Hart,"" but ""Remington Steele"" had something special.Laura Holt (played by Stephanie Zimbalist) starts her own detective agency, but finds it's a man's world and has a difficult time getting clients.  She creates a fictitous boss - Remington Steele.  Along comes a very real, yet nameless, gentleman (played by Pierce Brosnan) who is part high-class con man, part jewel thief and part lover of the finer things in life...including Laura.The mysteries can lead to some of the comedy, and the attraction between Laura and Remington lead to a little romance; but the heart of this show is Stephanie Zimbalist.She pumps life into the show, even when there's a silly plot.  I'm not taking anything away from Pierce; he's dapper, elegant and amusing.  I think he even gets better as the show progresses.  However, Stephanie is the reason this show works.  She perfectly portrays Laura with intelligence and strength but also allows us to see that she's vulnerable.  She made Laura a multi-faceted role model, and never dumbed it down.  Beautiful, brainy, feminine Laura is no damsel in distress.  There's no better actress to have brought her to life than Stephanie Zimbalist.Season one has 22 episodes and some enjoyable extras.  I rarely like the commentary on DVD's, but I really liked these.  The producers, writers and cast often provide interesting tidbits about locations, guest stars and how the show developed in general.  One of the reasons these commentaries were fun for me is that these people seem to enjoy reminiscing together and seem to really like each other.In this season, James Read and Janet DeMay round out the Remington Steele office.  James Read is excellent and provides an interesting triangle.I highly recommend this fun, clever series.",5,"No deep, dark secret here... this is a great show",1371513600,"06 18, 2013",2013,1985,"['Remington', 'Steele', 'fashion', 'rare', 'genre', 'combination', 'romantic', 'comedy/mystery', 'akin', 'Thin', 'Man', 'series', 'were', 'couple', 'TV', 'shows', '80', 'tapped', 'genre', 'Hart', 'Hart', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'had', 'something', 'special.Laura', 'Holt', 'played', 'Stephanie', 'Zimbalist', 'own', 'detective', 'agency', 'man', 'world', 'difficult', 'time', 'getting', 'clients', 'fictitous', 'boss', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'Along', 'very', 'real', 'yet', 'nameless', 'gentleman', 'played', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'who', 'part', 'high-class', 'con', 'man', 'part', 'jewel', 'thief', 'part', 'lover', 'finer', 'things', 'life', 'including', 'Laura.The', 'mysteries', 'can', 'lead', 'comedy', 'attraction', 'Laura', 'Remington', 'lead', 'little', 'romance', 'heart', 'show', 'Stephanie', 'Zimbalist.She', 'life', 'show', 'even', 'when', 'silly', 'plot', ""'m"", 'not', 'taking', 'anything', 'away', 'Pierce', 'dapper', 'elegant', 'amusing', 'think', 'even', 'better', 'show', 'However', 'Stephanie', 'reason', 'show', 'perfectly', 'Laura', 'intelligence', 'strength', 'also', 'see', 'vulnerable', 'made', 'Laura', 'multi-faceted', 'role', 'model', 'never', 'dumbed', 'down', 'Beautiful', 'brainy', 'feminine', 'Laura', 'damsel', 'distress', 'better', 'actress', 'have', 'brought', 'life', 'Stephanie', 'Zimbalist.Season', '22', 'episodes', 'enjoyable', 'extras', 'rarely', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'really', 'liked', 'producers', 'writers', 'cast', 'often', 'provide', 'interesting', 'tidbits', 'locations', 'guest', 'stars', 'how', 'show', 'developed', 'general', 'One', 'reasons', 'commentaries', 'were', 'fun', 'people', 'seem', 'enjoy', 'reminiscing', 'together', 'seem', 'really', 'like', 'other.In', 'season', 'James', 'Read', 'Janet', 'DeMay', 'round', 'out', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'office', 'James', 'Read', 'excellent', 'interesting', 'triangle.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'fun', 'clever', 'series']",N/A

Pierce Brosnan fit much better into this role than he did the later Bond movies.But the real stand-out here is the woman who never got the credit she deserved - the alluring and fantastic Stephanie Zimbalist.  I cannot help but laugh at the irony of a show about a woman not getting the visibility she deserves turning into a DVD with a cover on which the same woman is NOT VISIBLE!But, she is more than visible in the series, and without her there would be no Remington Steele - remember that, folks.Also standouts in this season are the two supporting roles that would later be combined into one character played by Doris Roberts.  But for season one, Bernice Fox and Murphy Michaels filled in admirably, and are much missed in later seasons (though Doris Roberts brought her own likability to the position).Now, the show is very much steeped in the style of the 80s.  Audiences of today who are used to the diet of hard-edged, gritty, realistic detective shows will see this series as light and useless fluff.  Some of the scenes are downright groan-inducing, like the obvious set-up for Murphy wanting to run up and bash a door open with his shoulder, only to have the door open at the last moment and him go galloping through the doorway and crashing into something inside like an idiot!  Basically, the kind of gag you'd see on SCOOBY DOO!  Or, the moment in one episode in which the killer turns out to be one of the news anchors, yet Steele makes sure the director of the broadcast leaves the cameras rolling so the man can have his final speech about how rotten the news is aired on live TV!  Like Steele would care, and like the director would let some nobody detective keep him from cutting the broadcast!But, these moments are not what the show is about.  This show is about chemistry, baby!  And Brosnan and Zimbalist have chemistry in spades!  I had forgotten what a terrific actress Zimbalist was.  And I was particularly impressed to see Mr. James Bond creating a VASTLY different character with Mr. Steele!  Indeed, he plays him with equal parts debonair and goofiness - a very lovable and endearing character!  I would have to say they had the best chemistry of the 80s detectives!It is in the scenes that they are sparring where the show reaches its peak moments! My particular favorite was an episode in which each thought the other was working on a different case, but turned out to be working the same case from opposite sides of the table!All in all, this is a nice set - the episodes look surprisingly good for their age (much better than the abysmal recent products such as LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRARIE) and the case itself is nicely streamlined to take up as little space as possible on your already crowded DVD shelf.  They accomplish this with double sided discs - so, all the episodes are here (make sure you get the COMBINED set, not the split up Vol 1 and Vol 2 deal) but only use up four discs in the case - NICE!If you liked the show at all, or just enjoyed the brief run of male/female detective shows from the early 80s, this one is a must have!",5,True fans might appreciate how wonderfully ironic it is that Stephanie Zimbalist doesn't appear cover of the DVD!,1128556800,"10 6, 2005",2005,3243,"['am', 'pleased', 'finally', 'made', 'DVD', 'what', 'great', 'romantic', 'series', 'testament', 'fact', 'was', 'indeed', 'SOME', 'good', 'television', 'early', '80s', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'fit', 'much', 'better', 'role', 'did', 'later', 'Bond', 'movies.But', 'real', 'stand-out', 'here', 'woman', 'who', 'never', 'got', 'credit', 'deserved', 'alluring', 'fantastic', 'Stephanie', 'Zimbalist', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'laugh', 'irony', 'show', 'woman', 'not', 'getting', 'visibility', 'turning', 'DVD', 'cover', 'same', 'woman', 'NOT', 'VISIBLE', 'more', 'visible', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'remember', 'folks.Also', 'standouts', 'season', 'are', 'two', 'supporting', 'roles', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'combined', 'one', 'character', 'played', 'Doris', 'Roberts', 'season', 'one', 'Bernice', 'Fox', 'Murphy', 'Michaels', 'filled', 'admirably', 'are', 'much', 'missed', 'later', 'seasons', 'Doris', 'Roberts', 'brought', 'own', 'likability', 'position', '.Now', 'show', 'very', 'much', 'steeped', 'style', '80s', 'Audiences', 'today', 'who', 'are', 'used', 'diet', 'hard-edged', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'detective', 'shows', 'will', 'see', 'series', 'light', 'useless', 'fluff', 'scenes', 'are', 'downright', 'groan-inducing', 'obvious', 'set-up', 'Murphy', 'wanting', 'run', 'up', 'bash', 'door', 'open', 'shoulder', 'only', 'have', 'door', 'open', 'last', 'moment', 'go', 'galloping', 'doorway', 'crashing', 'something', 'idiot', 'Basically', 'kind', 'gag', ""'d"", 'see', 'SCOOBY', 'DOO', 'moment', 'one', 'episode', 'killer', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'news', 'anchors', 'yet', 'Steele', 'sure', 'director', 'broadcast', 'cameras', 'rolling', 'so', 'man', 'can', 'have', 'final', 'speech', 'how', 'rotten', 'news', 'aired', 'live', 'TV', 'Steele', 'would', 'care', 'director', 'would', 'let', 'nobody', 'detective', 'keep', 'cutting', 'broadcast', 'moments', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'show', 'about', 'show', 'chemistry', 'baby', 'Brosnan', 'Zimbalist', 'have', 'chemistry', 'spades', 'had', 'forgotten', 'what', 'terrific', 'actress', 'Zimbalist', 'was', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'see', 'Mr.', 'James', 'Bond', 'creating', 'VASTLY', 'different', 'character', 'Mr.', 'Steele', 'Indeed', 'equal', 'parts', 'debonair', 'goofiness', 'very', 'lovable', 'endearing', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'had', 'best', 'chemistry', '80s', 'detectives', 'scenes', 'are', 'sparring', 'where', 'show', 'peak', 'moments', 'particular', 'favorite', 'was', 'episode', 'thought', 'other', 'was', 'working', 'different', 'case', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'working', 'same', 'case', 'opposite', 'sides', 'table', 'nice', 'set', 'episodes', 'look', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'age', 'much', 'better', 'abysmal', 'recent', 'products', 'such', 'LITTLE', 'HOUSE', 'THE', 'PRARIE', 'case', 'nicely', 'streamlined', 'take', 'up', 'as', 'little', 'space', 'possible', 'already', 'crowded', 'DVD', 'shelf', 'accomplish', 'double', 'sided', 'discs', 'so', 'episodes', 'are', 'here', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'COMBINED', 'set', 'not', 'split', 'up', 'Vol', '1', 'Vol', '2', 'deal', 'only', 'use', 'up', 'four', 'discs', 'case', 'NICE', 'liked', 'show', 'just', 'enjoyed', 'brief', 'run', 'male/female', 'detective', 'shows', 'early', '80s', 'one', 'must', 'have']",N/A

Together, the 2 battle crime as their feelings for each other in this fusion of who dunit mystery and screwball private detective drama burst onto television which ran on NBC from 1982-86, starting with this 1982-83 Season.After struggling to get clients to hire a female PI, Laura invents a fictional boss named Remington Steele(Pierce Brosnan), whose dashing manly name draws in work. But while protecting some South African jewels, Holt runs across a mysterious thief and con-man (an elfin, baby-faced Pierce Brosnan) whom her client assumes is the non-existent Steele--and when the case is resolved, the accidental detective decides he likes the work and sticks around, infuriating Holt with his arrogant ways and tantalizing her with his dashing good looks.Murders may occur at a winery, an island sex club, or a college reunion, but just about every episode plunders plot elements from classic movies like Bringing Up Baby, The Third Man, and The Trouble with Harry (even the theme song was written by film composer Henry Mancini).The writers openly acknowledge this influence by having Steele use ideas he's lifted from movies to solve crimes. The constant allusions to old films should be annoying, but the show demonstrates such a rich affection for the classics that these tips of the hat actually mesh with Remington Steele's world.Remington Steele has become best known as Brosnan's launching pad (he later become James Bond in Golden Eye and its sequels), but Zimbalist was every bit as crucial to the show's success; her mixture of glamor and toughness gave the show a distinctly adult sexiness and grounds Brosnan's boyish charm.The dialogue sometimes slipped from arch camp to sheer cheesiness, but even at its most ridiculous (say, a scene where Holt and Steele question homeless bums while dressed in formal evening wear) Remington Steele remains an eminently watchable show, thanks to zippy plotting and the chemistry between Zimbalist and Brosnan.Some episodes clearly implied that the pair had become intimate, yet that didn't defuse their attraction. Even when the stories became a bit silly, the mutual respect and desire between Holt and Steele never lost its sophistication.This detective drama takes me back to memory lane to when REMINGTON STEELE used to be on NBC every Tuesday night at 9PM following THE A-TEAM at 8PM, but with this DVD, you get to watch it complete & uncut without getting all those deleted scenes you get on ME TV, A&E;, and the Family Channel.",4,Before Brosnan's Bond Days,1391472000,"02 4, 2014",2014,2717,"['was', 'Bond', 'was', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'Private', 'eye', 'Laura', 'Holt', 'Stephanie', 'Zimbalist', 'grudgingly', 'new', 'partner', 'when', 'mystery', 'man', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'identity', 'fictitious', 'boss', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'Together', '2', 'battle', 'crime', 'feelings', 'other', 'fusion', 'who', 'dunit', 'mystery', 'screwball', 'private', 'detective', 'drama', 'burst', 'television', 'ran', 'NBC', '1982-86', 'starting', '1982-83', 'Season.After', 'struggling', 'get', 'clients', 'hire', 'female', 'PI', 'Laura', 'fictional', 'boss', 'named', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'dashing', 'manly', 'name', 'draws', 'work', 'protecting', 'South', 'African', 'jewels', 'Holt', 'mysterious', 'thief', 'con-man', 'elfin', 'baby-faced', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'whom', 'client', 'non-existent', 'Steele', 'when', 'case', 'resolved', 'accidental', 'detective', 'decides', 'work', 'sticks', 'infuriating', 'Holt', 'arrogant', 'ways', 'tantalizing', 'dashing', 'good', 'looks.Murders', 'may', 'occur', 'winery', 'island', 'sex', 'club', 'college', 'reunion', 'just', 'episode', 'plunders', 'plot', 'elements', 'classic', 'movies', 'Bringing', 'Up', 'Baby', 'Third', 'Man', 'Trouble', 'Harry', 'even', 'theme', 'song', 'was', 'written', 'film', 'composer', 'Henry', 'Mancini', 'writers', 'openly', 'acknowledge', 'influence', 'having', 'Steele', 'use', 'ideas', 'lifted', 'movies', 'solve', 'crimes', 'constant', 'allusions', 'old', 'films', 'should', 'be', 'annoying', 'show', 'rich', 'affection', 'classics', 'tips', 'hat', 'actually', 'mesh', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'world.Remington', 'Steele', 'become', 'best', 'known', 'Brosnan', 'launching', 'pad', 'later', 'become', 'James', 'Bond', 'Golden', 'Eye', 'sequels', 'Zimbalist', 'was', 'bit', 'crucial', 'show', 'success', 'mixture', 'glamor', 'toughness', 'gave', 'show', 'distinctly', 'adult', 'sexiness', 'Brosnan', 'boyish', 'charm.The', 'dialogue', 'sometimes', 'slipped', 'arch', 'camp', 'sheer', 'cheesiness', 'even', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'say', 'scene', 'where', 'Holt', 'Steele', 'question', 'homeless', 'bums', 'dressed', 'formal', 'evening', 'wear', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'eminently', 'watchable', 'show', 'thanks', 'zippy', 'plotting', 'chemistry', 'Zimbalist', 'Brosnan.Some', 'episodes', 'clearly', 'implied', 'pair', 'had', 'become', 'intimate', 'did', ""n't"", 'defuse', 'attraction', 'Even', 'when', 'stories', 'became', 'bit', 'silly', 'mutual', 'respect', 'desire', 'Holt', 'Steele', 'never', 'lost', 'sophistication.This', 'detective', 'drama', 'back', 'memory', 'lane', 'when', 'REMINGTON', 'STEELE', 'used', 'be', 'NBC', 'Tuesday', 'night', '9PM', 'following', 'A-TEAM', '8PM', 'DVD', 'get', 'watch', 'complete', 'uncut', 'getting', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'get', 'ME', 'TV', 'A', 'E', 'Family', 'Channel']",N/A

I do not only like the show but am becoming obsessed, picking up Seasons 1 and 2 within the week. Funnier still, is how average the mysteries are and how below average (at times) the acting of the guest stars are. Simply put without Holt and Steele so superbly cast I doubt this show would have lasted more than a season.But then that's the rub, isn't it? Stephanie Zimbalist and Pierce Brosnan have such AMAZING chemistry and are so fun to watch together that the stories and mysterys become a footnote and I COULD CARE LESS!! I love watching these two square off one minute and then be in some compromising innuendo the next.Shortly after trying this, I tried ""Moonlighting"", as was aghast at how utterly cold that couple seemed versus Stephanie Zimbalist and Pierce Brosnan. Holt and Steele are just alive in every way in every moment and I am glad to find this show at this time in my life. It will be sad when I get to Season 2 and have learned that Ms. Wolfe/Foxx and Murphy are gone:( I really like the whole leading cast in Season One and I fear that chemistry will be hard to duplicate, still I cannot reccommend this season highly enough. If you like witty dialogue, innuendo, and heart, you'll love this show, as for my heart though, it belongs to Stephanie:)If there's a weak spot it would be in the guest stars, the quality there tends to vary and is nowhere near the heights of a Columbo. Minor nits are things like the menu screens that identical on all discs and look a bit like photoshop chop jobs. And why no menu music? It would have been nice to hear different musics on each disc, instead there is none.",4,A Reele Steele,1141862400,"03 9, 2006",2006,1941,"['was', '14', '1982', 'was', 'probably', 'bedtime', '9pm', 'judging', 'often', 'romantic', 'nature', 'show', 'doubt', 'would', 'have', 'watched', 'time', 'anyway.Fast', 'forward', '24', 'years', 'add', 'subscription', 'Netflix', 'would', 'never', 'buy', 'whole', 'boxset', 'unseen', 'have', 'one', 'pleased', 'viewer', 'do', 'not', 'only', 'show', 'am', 'becoming', 'obsessed', 'picking', 'up', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'week', 'Funnier', 'still', 'how', 'average', 'mysteries', 'are', 'how', 'below', 'average', 'times', 'acting', 'guest', 'stars', 'are', 'Simply', 'put', 'Holt', 'Steele', 'so', 'superbly', 'cast', 'doubt', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'lasted', 'more', 'season.But', 'then', 'rub', ""n't"", 'Stephanie', 'Zimbalist', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'have', 'such', 'AMAZING', 'chemistry', 'are', 'so', 'fun', 'watch', 'together', 'stories', 'become', 'footnote', 'COULD', 'CARE', 'LESS', 'love', 'watching', 'two', 'square', 'one', 'minute', 'then', 'be', 'compromising', 'innuendo', 'next.Shortly', 'trying', 'tried', 'Moonlighting', 'was', 'aghast', 'how', 'utterly', 'cold', 'couple', 'seemed', 'versus', 'Stephanie', 'Zimbalist', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Holt', 'Steele', 'are', 'just', 'alive', 'way', 'moment', 'am', 'glad', 'find', 'show', 'time', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'sad', 'when', 'get', 'Season', '2', 'have', 'learned', 'Ms.', 'Wolfe/Foxx', 'Murphy', 'are', 'gone', 'really', 'whole', 'leading', 'cast', 'Season', 'One', 'fear', 'chemistry', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'duplicate', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'reccommend', 'season', 'highly', 'enough', 'like', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'innuendo', 'heart', ""'ll"", 'love', 'show', 'heart', 'Stephanie', 'weak', 'spot', 'would', 'be', 'guest', 'stars', 'quality', 'there', 'vary', 'nowhere', 'heights', 'Columbo', 'Minor', 'nits', 'are', 'things', 'menu', 'identical', 'discs', 'look', 'bit', 'photoshop', 'chop', 'jobs', 'why', 'menu', 'music', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'hear', 'different', 'musics', 'disc', 'instead', 'none']",N/A
