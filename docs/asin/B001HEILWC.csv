Main reason both vocalist can't sing right and ended up generally out of tune...So if you are expecting to enjoy Lacuna Coil at its best in a live performance, you will be quite disappointed.",3,Lacuna Coil is not good live,1387929600,"12 25, 2013",2013,333,"['something', 'realized', 'when', 'seeing', 'live', 'are', 'level', 'quality', 'will', 'expect', 'based', 'album', 'production', 'Main', 'reason', 'vocalist', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'right', 'ended', 'up', 'generally', 'tune', 'So', 'are', 'expecting', 'enjoy', 'Lacuna', 'Coil', 'best', 'live', 'performance', 'will', 'be', 'quite', 'disappointed']",N/A

That would pretty much sum it up.In my case I dislike Karmacode with a passion simply because in my ears it sounds like Korn with female vocals. I loathe Korn. But I went out and bought this DVD anyway knowing full well what I was getting.On disk 1 you have two concerts. Wacken and Loud Park. Both concerts were in fact professionally recorded. The Camera angles are gorgeous. There are no quick flashing camera angles and Cristina is in top form and commanding of her presense. The audio and visuals are superb!Also on disk 1 are all the music videos to the Karmacode era.Disk 2 contains extras. This is where the band failed miserably. The extras per band are 3-6 mins longs. Cristina's is the shortest clip of them all. The best of the bands bios is Andrea's and Cristina's. You see them travel to Australia and Japan but at the same time you see nothing. Both tour clips are very short and you get no one on one real connection with any of the members of the band. It's just quick clips.You also see the making of Closer and Our Truth. Those two clips were very cool to watch and entertaining.Also the fans sections. Very pointless and waste of space on the disk. There are a few remixes of To The Edge which were okay but useless.  Some horribly made fan videos. One containing some stupid chipmunks as Lacuna Coil. Another of some chick showing off her tattoo. I wanted to rip my hair out after seeing those.It's a descent DVD. 3 stars are for the excellent recording of the lives concerts and for the making of's the music video. But I hope Lacuna Coil's next dvd set has better extras.",3,First Lacuna Coil DVD,1232755200,"01 24, 2009",2009,1695,"['are', 'fan', 'Karmacode', 'DVD', 'IS', 'FOR', 'YOU', 'hate', 'Karmacode', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'would', 'pretty', 'much', 'sum', 'up.In', 'case', 'dislike', 'Karmacode', 'passion', 'simply', 'ears', 'Korn', 'female', 'vocals', 'loathe', 'Korn', 'went', 'out', 'bought', 'DVD', 'anyway', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'what', 'was', 'getting.On', 'disk', '1', 'have', 'two', 'concerts', 'Wacken', 'Loud', 'Park', 'concerts', 'were', 'fact', 'professionally', 'recorded', 'Camera', 'angles', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'are', 'quick', 'flashing', 'camera', 'angles', 'Cristina', 'top', 'form', 'commanding', 'presense', 'audio', 'visuals', 'are', 'superb', 'Also', 'disk', '1', 'are', 'music', 'videos', 'Karmacode', 'era.Disk', '2', 'contains', 'extras', 'where', 'band', 'failed', 'miserably', 'extras', 'band', 'are', '3-6', 'mins', 'longs', 'Cristina', 'shortest', 'clip', 'best', 'bands', 'bios', 'Andrea', 'Cristina', 'see', 'travel', 'Australia', 'Japan', 'same', 'time', 'see', 'nothing', 'tour', 'clips', 'are', 'very', 'short', 'get', 'one', 'one', 'real', 'connection', 'members', 'band', 'just', 'quick', 'clips.You', 'also', 'see', 'making', 'Closer', 'Truth', 'two', 'clips', 'were', 'very', 'cool', 'watch', 'entertaining.Also', 'fans', 'sections', 'Very', 'pointless', 'waste', 'space', 'disk', 'are', 'few', 'remixes', 'Edge', 'were', 'okay', 'useless', 'horribly', 'made', 'fan', 'videos', 'One', 'containing', 'stupid', 'chipmunks', 'Lacuna', 'Coil', 'chick', 'showing', 'tattoo', 'wanted', 'rip', 'hair', 'out', 'seeing', 'those.It', 'descent', 'DVD', '3', 'stars', 'are', 'excellent', 'recording', 'lives', 'concerts', 'making', 'music', 'video', 'hope', 'Lacuna', 'Coil', 'next', 'dvd', 'set', 'better', 'extras']",N/A
1199931,A36NKAR8NMFRI8,B001HEILWC,Masked Jackal,"[0, 1]","I've seen LC twice over the last couple of years, once inside a small venue about ten feet away from them, which was incredible, and once at Ozzfest about 100 yards away from the stage. Needless to say, the live offering at Ozzfest was kind of weak in my opinion, I didn't feel as if they were prepared for taking on the so called ""big stage""...My how they have grown!! Let me tell you, they handled Wacken like it was taking place in their own backyard!! I wasn't a huge fan of the setlist here, {because Karmacode is my least favorite release}, but I must say that in a live setting, those songs come over very strong, and work very well for them here. They manage to maintain a high level of power throughout the set, and they keep the crowd involved as well. All in all, I was very impressed with this performance. They look / sound great, and on a stage as big as Wacken, they took it by the horns!!...Cristina really shines live!!! She's the coolest Metal chick I've ever seen since Doro came along in 80's...The 2nd DVD isn't what I was hoping for. I wanted to see more footage of the band enjoying life on the road, and behind the scenes, that's not really here in any of it's raw stages / forms. It seems like this 2nd DVD was just thrown together last minute as a small bonus. They didn't need it in my opinion....4 STARS - Finally!!!

I was so excited at the prospect of a Lacuna Coil Dvd that I immediately bought it when it came out. Sadly this dvd completely disappoints.  First of all the quality is pretty bad for a professional dvd - that in itself ruined the dvd for me. Second, there is not enough NON-concert footage...the footage from when they were in Japan SUCKED...they kept repeating the same boring images over and over. I've seen some pictures from Cristina's myspace about their time in Japan and it seemed more interesting then what this dvd portrayed. It would have been nice to see a ""home video"" of sorts with Lacuna Coil exploring Japan. Oh well.  Honestly the only thing I did like about this dvd were the included music videos.  There should be a ""do-over"" dvd made because this one failed. PS. Fans would have loved to see some older stuff too - especially older performances.",2,Lacuna Lacking :(,1232668800,"01 23, 2009",2009,901,"[""'m"", 'HUGE', 'Lacuna', 'Coil', 'fan', 'HUGE', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'prospect', 'Lacuna', 'Coil', 'Dvd', 'immediately', 'bought', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'Sadly', 'dvd', 'completely', 'disappoints', 'First', 'quality', 'pretty', 'bad', 'professional', 'dvd', 'ruined', 'dvd', 'Second', 'not', 'enough', 'NON-concert', 'footage', 'footage', 'when', 'were', 'Japan', 'SUCKED', 'kept', 'repeating', 'same', 'boring', 'images', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'pictures', 'Cristina', 'myspace', 'time', 'Japan', 'seemed', 'more', 'interesting', 'then', 'what', 'dvd', 'portrayed', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'home', 'video', 'sorts', 'Lacuna', 'Coil', 'exploring', 'Japan', 'Oh', 'well', 'Honestly', 'only', 'thing', 'did', 'like', 'dvd', 'were', 'included', 'music', 'videos', 'should', 'be', 'do-over', 'dvd', 'made', 'one', 'failed', 'PS', 'Fans', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'older', 'stuff', 'too', 'especially', 'older', 'performances']",N/A
