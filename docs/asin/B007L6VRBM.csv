1533886,A16Z7PYQH36IYU,B007L6VRBM,Adam J. Rendall,"[1, 1]","I'm sure you've seen this movie before.  A poor schlub meets a quirky and beautiful girl who upsets his boring life and pushes him to discover more about himself.  There are a few things that set this film apart from your standard Manic Pixie Dream Girl fantasy, however.  The first is the setting; the last month before the end of the world provides a great context for people outside the main characters.  The second is Steve Carrell's dedication to his depression.  This isn't the story of a man who learns to love life, it's more the story of a man who manages to find a reason to stay alive just a bit longer.  And finally, Keira Knightly isn't just some magical creature--she has her own flaws and desires (more in the mode of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind than Garden State).I think this movie could be most directly compared to Wristcutters: A Love Story.  The same basic quest is there, the same troubled relationships, the same road trip through an increasingly odd landscape.  But while Wristcutters has the benefit of its magical realism and unique take, Seeking a Friend is stuck somewhere between its clever premise and need to play to a wide audience. It gets weird, but never quite so weird as it could.  There's always some element of humor to break up the tension when some of the real issues of life at the end of the world arises.  The side characters are met and discarded in quick order; there are some interesting reactions, but the plot never strays long from its 'depressed man meets girl who hasn't lived enough yet' core (which often has as much chemistry as you would expect if these two met in real life).That said, this isn't just your standard Hollywood popcorn fare.  There is some actual emotion that comes out of this movie, and some greatness that comes when it isn't afraid to be downright sad.  It's biggest problem is that it can manage laughs, and it can manage tears, but rarely is it ever able to combine the two rather than just alternating between them.",4,A Clever Take on a Well Done Trope,1351382400,"10 28, 2012",2012,2004,"[""'m"", 'sure', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'before', 'poor', 'schlub', 'quirky', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'who', 'boring', 'life', 'discover', 'more', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'set', 'film', 'apart', 'standard', 'Manic', 'Pixie', 'Dream', 'Girl', 'fantasy', 'however', 'first', 'setting', 'last', 'month', 'end', 'world', 'great', 'context', 'people', 'main', 'characters', 'second', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'dedication', 'depression', ""n't"", 'story', 'man', 'who', 'love', 'life', 'more', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'find', 'reason', 'stay', 'alive', 'just', 'bit', 'longer', 'finally', 'Keira', 'Knightly', ""n't"", 'just', 'magical', 'creature', 'own', 'flaws', 'desires', 'more', 'mode', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'Garden', 'State', '.I', 'think', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'most', 'directly', 'compared', 'Wristcutters', 'Love', 'Story', 'same', 'basic', 'quest', 'there', 'same', 'troubled', 'relationships', 'same', 'road', 'trip', 'increasingly', 'odd', 'landscape', 'Wristcutters', 'benefit', 'magical', 'realism', 'unique', 'take', 'Seeking', 'Friend', 'stuck', 'somewhere', 'clever', 'premise', 'need', 'play', 'wide', 'audience', 'weird', 'never', 'quite', 'so', 'weird', 'could', 'always', 'element', 'humor', 'break', 'up', 'tension', 'when', 'real', 'issues', 'life', 'end', 'world', 'side', 'characters', 'are', 'met', 'discarded', 'quick', 'order', 'are', 'interesting', 'reactions', 'plot', 'never', 'long', ""'depressed"", 'man', 'meets', 'girl', 'who', ""n't"", 'lived', 'enough', 'yet', 'core', 'often', 'as', 'much', 'chemistry', 'would', 'expect', 'two', 'met', 'real', 'life', 'said', ""n't"", 'just', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'popcorn', 'fare', 'actual', 'emotion', 'movie', 'greatness', 'when', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'be', 'downright', 'sad', 'biggest', 'problem', 'can', 'manage', 'laughs', 'can', 'manage', 'tears', 'rarely', 'ever', 'able', 'combine', 'two', 'rather', 'just', 'alternating']",N/A

As the opening credits roll, the viewer hears that Man's last hope has failed, and now that everyone must begin to prepare for the inevitable.  This setup is actually the best part of the movie.  Unfortunately, the rest of the movie does not effectively support the setup.Unlike other cosmic-impact disaster movies likeDeep ImpactandMeteor, where efforts to stop a doomsday impactor get intertwined with human dramas, the human drama takes center stage in ""Seeking a Friend...""  Steve Carrell plays a man whose wife is cheating on him.  He finds this out in a most unusual meet-cute, in which his neighbor, Keira Knightley, gives him mail that has been misdirected to her.  In what are supposed to be the last three weeks of humanity, Carrell and Knightley make a connection, one so strong that he is willing to let her go so that she can see her family across the pond in England.  Not only does she come back - after being given a lift by Carrell's dad, played by Martin Sheen - but she makes it back just before the impact to share sweet nothings with Carrell.So how exactly does the movie cheat?  Well, if you don't want to know, don't read beyond this sentence.  There's a major spoiler that must be revealed.If you've decided to read on, here's the spoiler.  The asteroid arrives a week earlier than anticipated, meaning that everyone loses in the end.  It's almost like the people who created this story didn't know exactly how to end it.  Memo to the makers of this film - this is NOT how you end it.  It felt very cheap and very shallow to me.  As such, the movie loses two stars just for that.It is actually quite refreshing to watch a disaster movie where the disaster is secondary to the plot, as it is in ""Seeking a Friend...""  And for what it is, it's not a bad movie.

The humor is only present to add poignancy to the dramatic, much like the gate keeper in Macbeth. But, too often, the humor is botched or spoofed with too much emphasis. For the most part, the movie is designed to make people think, 'how would they go down in the BIG END?' Obviously, not a lot of people ponder this, so the movie makes them think the difficult thoughts. As you might expect, such a movie gets mired in its own Plato/Ion conversations or moments, and thus drags.

It's somewhat romantic and a slow-moving one at that!  And yet... I do.  I do like the movie.  Sigh, haha.Even though a movie focusing on the end of the world should absolutely focus on the obvious emotional points such as fear, sadness and devastation, this movie takes the concept and uses it in a different way.  Not just different, but somewhat creative and refreshing.  An old concept with a new spin I guess you could say!For a while however, it's hard to look beyond the slow-moving plotline and even harder to look beyond the fact that Steve Carell is starring in such a movie.  He's a comedian for crying out loud!  But... get this, Seeking a Friend for the End of the World *does* actually utilize comedy but it's done in a subtle way.  This is part of the cleverness I mention above.  It's a fairly original concept that I was actually getting absorbed into last night, and enjoying it.While I'm definitely glad the writers chose to include elements of people breaking out into the streets and being destructive knowing their lives are soon to be over as a result of an asteroid heading for the planet that will destroy everything and everyone, later on when Steve ventures off into the country it's somewhat weird and perhaps eerie that everything out there has remained perfectly normal and calm.Anyway, it's about Steve wanting to hook up with an old flame from years ago, however a new girl suddenly enters his life.  A girl that apparently can sleep for days, haha.  Despite Steve knowing he only has less than 21 days until the world is destroyed, the search for his old girlfriend is now somewhat complicated due to the arrival of this new girl.  Steve has feelings for her as well.  Along the way Steve and the girl (played by Keira Knightley by the way, who's an amazing actress) go on a roadtrip to search for the girl.  They get involved in their own dilemmas along the way.  Typical adventure stuff here (despite much of it being funny and awesome) but... keep watching.I never understood where exactly the old girlfriend was when Steve and Keira eventually end up at her house and spend the night, but... who cares.This next part contains mild spoilers (since you can put the pieces together and figure out what happens at the end) so you might not want to read on.  You've been warned.There's two things in the second half I absolutely LOVE!  One is the use of the Hollies classic ""The Air That I Breathe"" one of the most tear-jearking and beautiful ballads ever written, played in its entirety (amazingly enough).  How many times is a song played the ENTIRE way through?  This is used for one segment involving a plane ride.  One of my personal favorite moments in the movie.  So beautiful and touching.However the ending... oh man, the ending.  Knowing in the back of our minds that all civilization is about to cease due to an approaching asteroid, without spoiling what happens, the ending is *superb*.  Incredibly sad.  The look in Keira's eyes bothers me quite a bit because she's so emotional with both happiness and sadness taking over her feelings during one particular moment.  You *badly* want her to live but... ugh.  So sad.Overall, surprisingly effective in both comedy and sadness.  The romantic portions are somewhat pushed to the side for the most part.  Also I LOVE all the elaborate vinyl talk between Steve and Keira!

It has some serious parts too, and a surprisingly sweet love story, which took me by surprise. The acting was uniformly good, and the story, while choppy in places, was probably realistic for that certain segment of our population. Most of the people in the film go for hedonism, drug abuse, interpersonal abuse, violence, despair and suicide. The main characters choose something better. Even though the world will end in three weeks, no one ever has a thought about God, but this is a Hollywood movie. They don't like it when people cling to God and guns.There is a May-December romance here, which is also typical of Hollywood, but with Matilda the comet coming, no one is going to get any older, so it didn't seem to matter.

1533914,A1KE3JBO3KQX2O,B007L6VRBM,Brian C.,"[7, 8]","I was not originally planning on writing a review for this movie, but I really thought it was a good movie, well worth watching, so I wanted to do my part to get the star count up. The movie is kind of a mix between a black comedy and a tragic romance. The movie lacks a single tone. Some might say that this movie lacks unity, or that it does not know what it wants to be, but it struck just the right chord for me. I think the combination is perfect.It seems like I rarely really laugh at comedies anymore, but this movie had some truly hilarious moments. It opens with a radio announcement that the last mission to save humanity from an asteroid hurtling toward the earth has failed, but that the radio station is going to continue bringing their listeners a countdown to the apocalypse, along with all their favorite classic rock hits. That opening sets the tone for the first part of the movie and all the absurd behavior of the human race in the face of their imminent demise. Highlights from the comedy side of the film include the relationship between Dodge (Steve Carrell) and his housekeeper, and the scene in the Friendly's (whoever the actor was who played the host did a brilliant job). I rarely see comedy that I think is this good, but this movie is more than just a comedy.Now I must give my SPOILER ALERT. The rest of the movie is about the relationship that forms between Dodge (Steve Carrell) and Penny (Keira Knightly) as they attempt to track down Dodge's high school sweetheart and get Penny back to England to see her family. In some ways we have seen this part of the movie before. The two strangers who set out on a mission together, both looking for something, but who wind up finding each other instead. While this is somewhat of a formula, it is a formula I happen to like, and I think this movie did a good job with it. There is also a story about Dodge's father who apparently abandoned him when he was young and their reconciliation which adds an emotional layer to the film. Dodge and Penny wind up spending their last days together, and I am glad the movie did not back away at the last minute from the end of the world. The last scene, I thought, was particularly well done. The romance may not be entirely believable, but I am inclined to suspend my disbelief for this movie, since I think the rest of the movie works so well.I think the movie might also be viewed as a meditation on what is really important in life. There are so many people hanging on to things (jobs, relationships, old wounds, etc.) that they are not really happy with. This movie, by forcing people to decide how they want to spend their last three weeks, also forces them to decide what is important to them. There is a scene on the beach, where a group of strangers have gathered and are just having a good time, that I think makes a point also made in Ecclesiastes ""All is vanity. So eat, drink, and be merry"" (I am paraphrasing). We all return to dust, so there is nothing to do but enjoy life. That seems to me, anyways, to be one of the messages of the movie.I have to say, the only thing that really mystified me about the movie (I remind everyone my SPOILER ALERT is in effect) was the decision to have the asteroid hit a week earlier than expected. It seems ridiculous to think that the scientists would have been off by a week. I could understand if it served some purpose in the plot but, as far as I can tell, it does not. So why ask the viewer to believe something so implausible if there is no purpose? If anyone can shed some light on this particular aspect of the movie I would love to hear it. It is not really a big deal. It certainly did not ruin the movie for me. I just do not understand it.In summary, I will say that I think this is one of the better movies I have seen in awhile.

Some would hire a hit-man so they wouldn't see the end coming. Some would shoot up heroin to Radiohead and curse out their kids; or stock up on guns and potato chips; or just have an all out drug and sex orgy in the hope of dying euphorically happy in a frenzy at Friendsy's. Then there's Dodge and Penny (played by Steve Carell and Kiera Knightly) who just want to hold tight to those they love during their final moments.It really is a sweet and touching story of two people discovering love stripped of pretenses, expectation and safety nets. As one reviewer pointed out, this movie is quite the existential exploration and journey illuminating the idea that a lifetime of mediocrity, and/or whimsy becomes meaningless when the last final moments are spent fully awake and embracing one's desires.Do not expect a mindless movie with an applesauce script and storyline. In essence, this really is a thought provoking film that centers on the heavy subject of facing one's death and finding meaning in one's life. However, it is served on quite an enjoyable platter presenting some great characters, funny scenes, and tearful moments. Hats off to Carell and Knightly (also Martin Sheen and William Peterson, among others who pop up) who make their job look so easy in emoting these two wonderful characters, who will stay with you when the screen fades to black.PS - if you happen question or get into the debate about whether or not &#34;that&#34; plane would make &#34;that&#34; trip, just let it go.... it's a movie, not a re-creation of an event.

A true chameleon,a versatile actress.This is probably one of the most truthful movies I have ever seen about the end of the world, and how people/society would react. Just as we all are different in how we handle stress or loss or being spontaneous..so shall we all have varying paths to take when death is inevitable. There will be riots, and panic, desperation, fear, sadness. Some people will have massive amounts of energy and go seek everything they always wanted to do. Some will shut themselves inside and deny its all happening. Some will want to kill themselves, or do really dangerous things that would otherwise be thought of as illegal, or morally wrong.Its a free for all. So what does a man who never felt free in a pre-asteroid world do? His wife leaves him as soon as the news tells of the harbinger of death. He still goes to work because what else is there? His world is empty, meaningless ...but below that surface is a want to tie things up with lost family, lost loves, the loss of himself.

Heck- even without &#34;proper&#34; locations (the California settings local to the filmmaker and clearly and free of expensive location fees and management costs in no way passed for the northeastern U.S.). But none of those zero-budget conditions detracted in the least. Kind of whittled away all the bombast, and made the actual story stand out more, in fact. A plus!Keira Knightley steps out of her usual China Doll Glam roles to give a heart touching portrayal of a real girl (i.e., unmarried young woman) caught up in an approaching doom. Other cast members are equally apt in the same scenario. For example, Steve Carell plays it straight to great effect, and Martin Sheen is the perfect dad. Other A-list character actors flesh-out the supporting roles. I don't know what encouraged them all to take part in this project, perhaps it was simply that they saw a chance to be real and creative and touching? (Notice I did not say &#34;artful,&#34; as that would be too pretentious- but it's true anyway!)This is not at all a typical big-budget disaster movie- and while some of those can be good, solid &#34;human&#34; films, of course- such as 1998's &#34;Deep Impact,&#34; some of them can be so lost in all the CGI that they come off as overwrought cartoons with little meaning. &#34;Seeking a Friend...&#34; has great meaning. I liked it in the theaters, and was pleasantly surprised to find that I have watched the Blu-Ray several times, enjoying it each time. it is engaging, sweet, and poignant. it does show how an artistic vision and a handful of great actors are really all that is needed to wrap an audience up in a most worthwhile story.",5,Great movie!

It's a comedy with a definite dark edge (the end of the world, anyone?).  It's also a tender, poignant love story portrayed in a heartfelt manner, a love story centering around impish free spirit Penny (Kiera Knightley), and moody, despondent, down-to-earth Dodge (Steve Carell).  Talk about bad hair days.  On the day Dodge and his wife learn that super asteroid 'Matilda' is going to strike the earth in three weeks, ending human life, his wife literally bails.  Facing Armageddon alone, Dodge is depressed and in despair; the only sympathy he collects is from a stray Heinz 57 mutt.  Meanwhile, humanity has transitioned into a handful of layers:  the hedonists, who are going to party until the party's over; the deniers, who continue to live their lives like they always have; and those who cannot handle what's taking place, and select suicide.  Into this mix comes Penny, a neighbor of Dodge whom he barely knows, who has some of Dodge's mail going back three years. . .including a letter from Dodge's high school sweetheart, where she proclaims Dodge is ""the love of my life.""  And Penny, whose family is across the pond, wishes to get back to them to spend the last remaining days with her loved ones; thus a road trip is in order, a journey to find Dodge's old flame, and a journey to seek a way to get Penny aboard a plane (the airlines have shut down).  And the road trip depicts the overall charm of SEEKIING A FRIEND FOR THE END OF THE WORLD.There are some true comedic moments in this film, yet the underlying love story, an evolving affection between Penny and Dodge as they embark on their trip, trumps the comedy.  The emotional climax begins when Dodge and his father (Martin Sheen at his best) reconcile, having been estranged for years, and ends with Penny and Dodge holding one another as Matilda literally can be heard entering the earth's atmosphere.  It's a dark, bittersweet ending; kudos to director Lorene Scafaria for not coming up with some lame ""solution"" (e.g., Matilda miraculously misses the earth).  A tad uneven with a tendency to meander, SEEKING A FRIEND FOR THE END OF THE WORLD will still put a smile on your face--and a lump in your throat.

And they get to really know each other along the way.It is at times serious and contemplative and other times shifts to gallows humor.

1533965,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B007L6VRBM,Ed Uyeshima,"[11, 14]","There's a unique and more courageous movie lurking on the fringes of screenwriter and first-time director Lorene Scafaria's whimsical, melancholic take on Armageddon, but this relatively low-key 2012 drama has a change of heart at the two-thirds mark that makes the inevitable ending feel almost conventional relative to its idiosyncratic start. Instead of dealing with mankind's fate in a special-effects-laden extravaganza, Scafaria blessedly reduces the scale to ponder how a small circle of people respond to the prospect of impending oblivion. In this respect, her humanistic approach is similar to Lars von Trier's recentMelancholiawhere the focus was on two sisters with opposing sensibilities. This film focuses on a more unlikely pair - Dodge Petersen, a menopausal, emotionally wounded insurance salesman and Penny Lockhart, a free spirit hypersomniac with a passion for classic vinyl records. The plot starts simply enough when a radio announcer nonchalantly announces that the last-ditch attempt to avert a seventy-mile-wide asteroid named Mathilda has failed.Dodge's wife runs away immediately upon hearing the news, while their friends decide to end their days with uninhibited debauchery, excessive amounts of alcohol, and heroin injections. At first, the nearly catatonic Dodge doesn't alter his daily routine as he goes to his office and finds people disappearing and committing suicide in the face of the disaster. He eventually decides to seek out his long-ago love Olivia, and his bohemian neighbor Penny wants to help him in exchange for the possibility that he can find her a way to get back home to her family in England. The movie then turns into a road trip where, of course, they meet up with a series of eccentrics, all the while forming an alliance that turns unsurprisingly into love. The early scenes like their encounter with the hedonistic, lascivious staff at a TGIF-like restaurant are quirky, unexpected, and funny in an absurdist way. However, when Dodge starts to recognize his do-or-die attraction to Penny, the transition is barely apparent, and the rush of romanticism never feels quite authentic, especially in light of the ensuing episodes which become increasingly predictable.It's quite possible that Scafaria intended the shift in tone to be subtle to the point of non-existent, but it leaves a bit of an emotional vacuum which the actors have to fill in with their performances. By now, Steve Carell is no stranger to the sad loner character he portrays here, having done similar duty inLittle Miss Sunshine,Dan in Real Life, and last year'sCrazy, Stupid, Love, and there is definitely a feeling of retread in his work here. Yet, his innate likeability and common-man sensibilities eventually won me over. In a change-of-pace from her more histrionic roles, Keira Knightley captures Penny's sprightly mannerisms nicely, although I have to admit her off-kilter performance sometimes feels like an impersonation of Kate Winslet's Clementine inEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. While a nice rapport develops between Carell and Knightley, the romantic sparks never really ignite in any compelling way to make us feel more resonantly about their characters' fates. Still, there is a lingering sweetness to the whole enterprise that's hard to resist, and I found myself hoping there was some other way to end a movie that telegraphs its intentions from the outset.There are lots of recognizable faces in small roles and cameos sprinkled throughout - Rob Corddry as Dodge's nihilistic neighbor, a nicely comic Connie Britton as his horned-up wife, Melanie Lynskey as the wanton woman who they throw to Dodge to provide instant gratification in the remaining days, Patton Oswalt as another neighbor taking full advantage of the open floodgates for available sex, Adam Brody as Penny's over-sensitive current boyfriend, Derek Luke as her humorless survivalist ex-boyfriend, William Petersen as a somewhat suspect trucker, T.J. Miller as the stoner-friendly restaurant host, and Martin Sheen as Dodge's estranged father. The music on the eclectic soundtrack is well chosen from Frank Black's ""In My Time of Ruin"" to the Hollies' ""The Air That I Breathe"" to Herb Alpert's ""This Guy's in Love with You"". It's worth seeing just to see a different take on a hopelessly curious premise, but the execution is not as uniquely individualistic or emotionally resonant as I was hoping it would be.",3,The Quirkiness Abates Well Before End of Days in a Conventionally Oddball Romcom,1340841600,"06 28, 2012",2012,4428,"['unique', 'more', 'courageous', 'movie', 'lurking', 'fringes', 'screenwriter', 'first-time', 'director', 'Lorene', 'Scafaria', 'whimsical', 'melancholic', 'take', 'Armageddon', 'relatively', 'low-key', '2012', 'drama', 'change', 'heart', 'two-thirds', 'mark', 'inevitable', 'ending', 'feel', 'almost', 'conventional', 'relative', 'idiosyncratic', 'start', 'Instead', 'dealing', 'mankind', 'fate', 'special-effects-laden', 'extravaganza', 'Scafaria', 'blessedly', 'scale', 'ponder', 'how', 'small', 'circle', 'people', 'respond', 'prospect', 'impending', 'oblivion', 'respect', 'humanistic', 'approach', 'similar', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'recentMelancholiawhere', 'focus', 'was', 'two', 'sisters', 'opposing', 'sensibilities', 'film', 'more', 'unlikely', 'pair', 'Dodge', 'Petersen', 'menopausal', 'emotionally', 'wounded', 'insurance', 'salesman', 'Penny', 'Lockhart', 'free', 'spirit', 'hypersomniac', 'passion', 'classic', 'vinyl', 'records', 'plot', 'simply', 'enough', 'when', 'radio', 'announcer', 'nonchalantly', 'last-ditch', 'attempt', 'avert', 'seventy-mile-wide', 'asteroid', 'named', 'Mathilda', 'failed.Dodge', 'wife', 'away', 'immediately', 'hearing', 'news', 'friends', 'decide', 'end', 'days', 'uninhibited', 'debauchery', 'excessive', 'amounts', 'alcohol', 'heroin', 'injections', 'first', 'nearly', 'catatonic', 'Dodge', ""n't"", 'alter', 'daily', 'routine', 'office', 'people', 'disappearing', 'committing', 'suicide', 'face', 'disaster', 'eventually', 'seek', 'out', 'long-ago', 'love', 'Olivia', 'bohemian', 'neighbor', 'Penny', 'help', 'exchange', 'possibility', 'can', 'find', 'way', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'family', 'England', 'movie', 'then', 'road', 'trip', 'where', 'course', 'meet', 'up', 'series', 'eccentrics', 'while', 'forming', 'alliance', 'unsurprisingly', 'love', 'early', 'scenes', 'encounter', 'hedonistic', 'lascivious', 'staff', 'TGIF-like', 'restaurant', 'are', 'quirky', 'unexpected', 'funny', 'absurdist', 'way', 'However', 'when', 'Dodge', 'recognize', 'do-or-die', 'attraction', 'Penny', 'transition', 'barely', 'apparent', 'rush', 'romanticism', 'never', 'quite', 'authentic', 'especially', 'light', 'ensuing', 'episodes', 'become', 'increasingly', 'predictable.It', 'quite', 'possible', 'Scafaria', 'intended', 'shift', 'tone', 'be', 'subtle', 'point', 'non-existent', 'bit', 'emotional', 'vacuum', 'actors', 'have', 'fill', 'performances', 'now', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'stranger', 'sad', 'loner', 'character', 'here', 'having', 'done', 'similar', 'duty', 'inLittle', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'Dan', 'Real', 'Life', 'last', ""year'sCrazy"", 'Stupid', 'Love', 'definitely', 'feeling', 'retread', 'work', 'here', 'innate', 'likeability', 'common-man', 'sensibilities', 'eventually', 'won', 'over', 'change-of-pace', 'more', 'histrionic', 'roles', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Penny', 'sprightly', 'mannerisms', 'nicely', 'have', 'admit', 'off-kilter', 'performance', 'sometimes', 'feels', 'impersonation', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Clementine', 'inEternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'nice', 'rapport', 'Carell', 'Knightley', 'romantic', 'sparks', 'never', 'really', 'ignite', 'compelling', 'way', 'make', 'feel', 'more', 'resonantly', 'characters', 'fates', 'Still', 'lingering', 'sweetness', 'whole', 'enterprise', 'hard', 'resist', 'found', 'hoping', 'was', 'other', 'way', 'end', 'movie', 'intentions', 'are', 'lots', 'recognizable', 'small', 'roles', 'cameos', 'sprinkled', 'Rob', 'Corddry', 'Dodge', 'nihilistic', 'neighbor', 'nicely', 'comic', 'Connie', 'Britton', 'horned-up', 'wife', 'Melanie', 'Lynskey', 'wanton', 'woman', 'who', 'throw', 'Dodge', 'provide', 'instant', 'gratification', 'remaining', 'days', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'neighbor', 'taking', 'full', 'advantage', 'open', 'floodgates', 'available', 'sex', 'Adam', 'Brody', 'Penny', 'over-sensitive', 'current', 'boyfriend', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'humorless', 'survivalist', 'ex-boyfriend', 'William', 'Petersen', 'somewhat', 'suspect', 'trucker', 'T.J.', 'Miller', 'stoner-friendly', 'restaurant', 'host', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Dodge', 'estranged', 'father', 'music', 'eclectic', 'soundtrack', 'well', 'chosen', 'Frank', 'Black', 'My', 'Time', 'Ruin', 'Hollies', 'Air', 'Breathe', 'Herb', 'Alpert', 'Guy', 'Love', 'worth', 'seeing', 'just', 'see', 'different', 'take', 'hopelessly', 'curious', 'premise', 'execution', 'not', 'uniquely', 'individualistic', 'emotionally', 'resonant', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'be']",N/A

That's something you don't want to hear from your television news anchorman. A 70-mile-wide asteroid hurtles toward our planet, poised to arrive in three weeks' time. Our would-be saviors - them experts and scientists and world leaders - have tried everything and now given up the ghost. If you're raring for a wild sci-fi disaster film, give yourself a time out. This film isn't about heroes and last-minute saves. It's about folks like you and me and how they react to the end times. It's also got this flavor of an indie rom-com. In SEEKING A FRIEND FOR THE END OF THE WORLD Steve Carell doesn't hop on a space shuttle to plant a nuclear device on the asteroid.He instead adopts a dog and plays his harmonica and goes in search of his lost love. Steve Carell plays Dodge, a sad-faced insurance agent (which is all kinds of ironic), whose wife, once the bad news broke out over the car radio, lit out of that car as if she were a Stark and the Rains of Castamere just started playing. Carell's movie wife is played by his real-life wife, Nancy, and I'm 71% positive her abrupt flight doesn't reflect their real-life relationship. There I go spearheading rumors. They're fine.As the clock winds down to Armageddon, Dodge quietly goes about his everyday routine, even as the world falls apart around him. But here's his catalyst in the shape of adorable downstairs neighbor Penny (Keira Knightley), whom Dodge finds slumped over outside his fire escape and weeping. Penny has tried (and failed piteously) to catch any one of the last few flights out to England, her home. And there won't be anymore flights out ever. He lets her into his apartment. They get to talking. He mentions knowing a pilot who could fly her out. And when the riots come, they embark on a road trip, she hopefully on her way back home, he hopefully to reconnect with his one true love. Cue the dog left in his care and the harmonica he sporadically plays. These cute embellishments, I suppose, make him a bit more endearing, this emotionally-stunted man done with selling insurance.There's a raunchy apocalyptic comedy coming out tomorrow titled THIS IS THE END, and I'll probably go see that one. I'm assuming that movie strikes a very different tone than this one, even though both films play for laughs. There's a pensiveness to SEEKING A FRIEND..., a sense of melancholia. I think Carell and Knightley have a surprising chemistry. Her role calls for a certain free-spirited flourish. He is an existential wasteland on legs. They are diametric opposites, and that's why the interplay between them is so interesting. It's weird to match up Carell and Knightley as a romantic couple. But because their performances are so good and level, and because their scenes together are sweet and played without that knowing wink - and because the premise IS the end of the world - in which anything goes - well, I bought it. Keira Knightley, by the way, proves she's got what it takes to be a fine comedienne. I prefer this Knightley to her high-brow period piece incarnation.At the end of the world it's not an exaggeration to say that there's this palpable elegiac feel, of things slipping away, of this sense that this is the last time you'll be doing whatever it is you're doing. As Dodge and Penny navigate their road trip, they run into people made strange by their impending extinction. It lends insight into how disparate groups of people would cope. It gives the film opportunities for hilarious celebrity cameos (Patton Oswalt, not so much, sorry). The funniest set piece is Dodge and Penny's stop at Friendsy's, a restaurant chain that's devolved into a hedonistic den of impromptu hugs and orgies. Shame on T.G.I.F. for rejecting the filmmakers' request to use their good name.In watching this, I wasn't expecting that sudden stab of heartbreak, but there it was. The final moments are devastating, and yet there's this last fleeting glimpse of a glorious smile. At the end of the world, I guess it's the best happy ending one could hope for.The DVD's bonus stuff:- Audio Commentary with writer/director Lorene Scafaria, the director's mom Gail Scafaria, producer Joy Gorman, and actors Patton Oswalt and Adam Brody- Outtakes (00:08:36 minutes)- A Look Inside SEEKING A FRIEND FOR THE END OF THE WORLD -

We have been getting them from the big Hollywood side (Roland Emmerich's embarrassingly awful 2012), from the art-house side (Lars Von Trier's meandering MELANCHOLIA), and now with Lorene Scafaria's directorial debut, SEEKING A FRIEND AT THE END OF THE WORLD, we get a bit of both in one of the strangest and strangely charming films of 2012.We begin with a radio broadcast of a failed space shuttle mission to destroy the giant asteroid that spells doom for the entire planet. Dodge (Steve Carell) sits in his car with his wife (a cameo by his real wife Nancy) and hears this, and without warning or explanation, she leaves the car towards parts unknown. Now alone and awaiting the apocalypse, Dodge continues his workaday humdrum, going to his job as an insurance salesman, and receiving calls about the &#34;Apocalypse Package&#34; (which covers you in the event that all life on Earth comes to an end). He goes back to his apartment and ruminates about his first love and how he wants to see her before the end. He even goes to a kind of end-of-the-world party with his friends (played by a number of comic and character actors such as Rob Corddry, Connie Britton, Melanie Lynskey, and the hilarious Patton Oswalt), which ends disasterously. He goes home to find the free-spirited Penny (Keira Knightley) weeping outside on his fire escape, regretful about her parents back home in England she won't get to see since all commercial flights are now grounded. They soon embark on a mission for the both of them to get what they feel that they need before it's all over; he will try and get her on a private plane, and she will accompany him to try and meet the former love of his life. In the midst of all of this, they meet and connect with strangers and friends, go to a very sexually liberated &#34;family&#34; restaurant, and they make a connection of their own despite their best intentions.The thing about this film is that nothing really unfolds as you might expect. From the commercials and trailers, you will likely expect a dark yet raunchy screwball romantic comedy about the apocalypse, but writer/director Scafaria has something different in mind. She tells a story that has elements of the screwball rom com, but it ends up being much sweeter, with much more depth and personality rather than taking the quick way out. Carell gives what is probably his most soulful performance to date, which is something of a challenge when you have a big name comic actor like Carell, who can do the super-broad comedy, but who has also shown before, with roles in films like LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE that he has more depth than you'd predict. He plays on the archetype that he presented so well in THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN, but with more dimensions, and it never really hits a false note. Knightley continues the terrific post-PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN performances we've been seeing from her since she finally up and left that franchise. Like her work in other indie fare such as A DANGEROUS METHOD and NEVER LET ME GO, she's on fire here as the passionate and devil-may-care Penny. She's utterly charming and hopeful, despite the impending doom, and it's so easy to see why Dodge wants to help her. Other performers we see here in more decent-sized cameos, such as William Petersen (in a hilarious role as a stranger who's looking for a very unpredictable end), Adam Brody as Penny's amazingly egocentric former/current boyfriend, Derek Luke as a former boyfriend and super-survivalist, TJ Miller as the wild maitre'd of the restaurant, and Martin Sheen as a surprise character all make the most of their time on-screen and turn in very good work.Scafaria has only one other significant credit to her name, being the screenwriter of the very quirky NICK AND NORAH'S INFINITE PLAYLIST, but she has a great assuredness not only writing but directing this film as well. Visually, the film is very well made, as well as musically, with a generous helping of songs peppered throughout the soundtrack. The film does change rhythms around the middle of the second act from more of a comedy and into more of a romance, and it might leave you feeling a little confused if you're expecting something typical of most films of this type. But if you're into something that will not only make you laugh, maybe cry, and make you wish you had (or glad that you DO have) that very special someone to share it with, then SEEKING A FRIEND AT THE END OF THE WORLD will make you a very satisfied viewer, and also leave you wondering that if you only had three weeks to live, how you might spend it. Hopefully, you'd spend it as Dodge and Penny do.",5,"If the End of the World was near, where would you choose to be?",1362873600,"03 10, 2013",2013,4886,"['Thanks', 'pesky', 'Mayans', ""'ve"", 'been', 'plagued', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'several', 'End', 'World', 'films', 'dreaded', 'asteroids', 'solar', 'radiation', 'Rapturous', 'events', 'ca', ""n't"", 'escape', 'many', 'hard', 'enjoy', 'have', 'been', 'getting', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'side', 'Roland', 'Emmerich', 'embarrassingly', 'awful', '2012', 'art-house', 'side', 'Lars', 'Von', 'Trier', 'meandering', 'MELANCHOLIA', 'now', 'Lorene', 'Scafaria', 'directorial', 'debut', 'SEEKING', 'FRIEND', 'AT', 'THE', 'END', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'get', 'bit', 'one', 'strangest', 'strangely', 'charming', 'films', '2012.We', 'begin', 'radio', 'broadcast', 'failed', 'space', 'shuttle', 'mission', 'destroy', 'giant', 'asteroid', 'doom', 'entire', 'planet', 'Dodge', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'car', 'wife', 'cameo', 'real', 'wife', 'Nancy', 'warning', 'explanation', 'car', 'towards', 'parts', 'unknown', 'Now', 'alone', 'awaiting', 'apocalypse', 'Dodge', 'workaday', 'humdrum', 'going', 'job', 'insurance', 'salesman', 'receiving', 'calls', '34', 'Apocalypse', 'Package', '34', 'event', 'life', 'Earth', 'end', 'back', 'apartment', 'first', 'love', 'how', 'see', 'end', 'even', 'kind', 'end-of-the-world', 'party', 'friends', 'played', 'number', 'comic', 'character', 'actors', 'such', 'Rob', 'Corddry', 'Connie', 'Britton', 'Melanie', 'Lynskey', 'hilarious', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'disasterously', 'home', 'find', 'free-spirited', 'Penny', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'weeping', 'outside', 'fire', 'escape', 'regretful', 'parents', 'back', 'home', 'England', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'commercial', 'flights', 'are', 'now', 'grounded', 'soon', 'embark', 'mission', 'get', 'what', 'feel', 'need', 'over', 'will', 'try', 'get', 'private', 'plane', 'will', 'accompany', 'try', 'meet', 'former', 'love', 'life', 'midst', 'meet', 'connect', 'strangers', 'friends', 'go', 'very', 'sexually', 'liberated', '34', 'family', '34', 'restaurant', 'make', 'connection', 'own', 'best', 'intentions.The', 'thing', 'film', 'nothing', 'really', 'might', 'expect', 'commercials', 'trailers', 'will', 'likely', 'expect', 'dark', 'yet', 'raunchy', 'screwball', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'apocalypse', 'writer/director', 'Scafaria', 'something', 'different', 'mind', 'story', 'elements', 'screwball', 'rom', 'com', 'up', 'being', 'much', 'sweeter', 'much', 'more', 'depth', 'personality', 'rather', 'taking', 'quick', 'way', 'Carell', 'what', 'probably', 'most', 'soulful', 'performance', 'date', 'something', 'challenge', 'when', 'have', 'big', 'name', 'comic', 'actor', 'Carell', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'super-broad', 'comedy', 'who', 'also', 'shown', 'before', 'roles', 'films', 'LITTLE', 'MISS', 'SUNSHINE', 'more', 'depth', ""'d"", 'predict', 'archetype', 'presented', 'so', 'well', 'THE', '40-YEAR-OLD', 'VIRGIN', 'more', 'dimensions', 'never', 'really', 'false', 'note', 'Knightley', 'terrific', 'post-PIRATES', 'THE', 'CARIBBEAN', ""'ve"", 'been', 'seeing', 'finally', 'up', 'left', 'franchise', 'work', 'other', 'indie', 'fare', 'such', 'A', 'DANGEROUS', 'METHOD', 'NEVER', 'LET', 'ME', 'GO', 'fire', 'here', 'passionate', 'devil-may-care', 'Penny', 'utterly', 'charming', 'hopeful', 'impending', 'doom', 'so', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'Dodge', 'help', 'Other', 'performers', 'see', 'here', 'more', 'decent-sized', 'cameos', 'such', 'William', 'Petersen', 'hilarious', 'role', 'stranger', 'who', 'looking', 'very', 'unpredictable', 'end', 'Adam', 'Brody', 'Penny', 'amazingly', 'egocentric', 'former/current', 'boyfriend', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'former', 'boyfriend', 'super-survivalist', 'TJ', 'Miller', 'wild', 'maitre', ""'d"", 'restaurant', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'surprise', 'character', 'make', 'most', 'time', 'on-screen', 'turn', 'very', 'good', 'work.Scafaria', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'significant', 'credit', 'name', 'being', 'screenwriter', 'very', 'quirky', 'NICK', 'AND', 'NORAH', 'INFINITE', 'PLAYLIST', 'great', 'assuredness', 'not', 'only', 'writing', 'directing', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'Visually', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'as', 'well', 'musically', 'generous', 'helping', 'songs', 'peppered', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'change', 'rhythms', 'middle', 'second', 'act', 'more', 'comedy', 'more', 'romance', 'might', 'leave', 'feeling', 'little', 'confused', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'something', 'typical', 'most', 'films', 'type', ""'re"", 'something', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'make', 'laugh', 'maybe', 'cry', 'make', 'wish', 'had', 'glad', 'DO', 'have', 'very', 'special', 'someone', 'share', 'then', 'SEEKING', 'FRIEND', 'AT', 'THE', 'END', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'will', 'make', 'very', 'satisfied', 'viewer', 'also', 'leave', 'wondering', 'only', 'had', 'three', 'weeks', 'live', 'how', 'might', 'spend', 'Hopefully', ""'d"", 'spend', 'Dodge', 'Penny', 'do']",N/A

1534020,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B007L6VRBM,J. Richardson,"[1, 1]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.It's the end of the world!... for the 100th time in three years. Yes, while the whole end of the world theme has been pretty overdone recently, none of those films even come close to the beauty of this one. As the credits started rolling I found myself in tears and I wasn't able to regain my composure for a good fifteen minutes. Still, as I continued to fight back tears for the remainder of the night, I found myself unable to take my mind off of what I just watched. The emotion was so raw, the romance so pure, it was unlike anything I have witnessed in a movie. Don't get me wrong, there's been films that have made me emotional, but what went down with Seeking a Friend for the End of the World was an entirely different experience.As the movie begins you quickly get caught up on what's going on. At this point we meet Dodge Paterson (Steve Carell) and learn that the mission to take down the asteroid known as Matilda has failed. Not only that, but the people of Earth only have three weeks left to live. It doesn't take long before Dodge meets Penny (Keira Knightley) and pretty soon they're off on their adventure together. You see, they both have different goals. Dodge wants to reconnect with the one that got away while Penny wants to get back to her family. Along the way an unexpected romance surfaces between these two individuals and the audience sees that, in some cases, opposites really do attract. Carell's character is a man we've seen him play many times before; unsure of himself, a little hesitant about interacting with people, etc. Penny, on the other hand, is this raw, unkempt woman who was never able to find her path in life.One of the things I really loved about this movie was seeing just how different everyone reacted to what was going on. Some people started riots, some partied, worked on their bucket list, continued with their daily routine (work, mowing the lawn, etc.), went back to their families, or hid in a shelter. It gave me a weird feeling because how are you even supposed to react to something like that? There isn't a guideline on how to live when you know that the end is coming; you just have to figure it out yourself. It was all very dark because some people gave up while others seemed to be in denial.Now I would have never thought that a Carell/Knightley team-up would work, but I would be lying if I said it didn't. While these two don't have what would be considered ""normal"" chemistry, it works given the context of the movie. Because their time is coming to a close they no longer have the same judgmental attitude that probably plagued them in the past. Instead, they got to know each other on a purely fundamental level and they're genuinely interested in learning about who they are and where they're from because they were previously living on completely opposite sides of the spectrum. With that said, towards the end I felt the advancement of their relationship felt a bit rushed, but it was something that had to be done to achieve the beautiful ending we were given.Which brings me to my last major point about the plot, Seeking a Friend for the End of the World is not a comedy. Well, not really anyway. It can be funny at times, but it's not meant to be laugh out loud funny. Instead, most of the laughs come from seeing just how different everyone is reacting to their current situation. Whether it's Dodge's cleaning lady who won't stop cleaning his place or the cop who's still taking his job too seriously, it's the social aspect that makes you chuckle right before it gets you thinking. Also, the ending is harsh. The conclusion to the story isn't happy and it's basically there to make you feel sad. The emotional impact wouldn't have been possible without that weird chemistry between Carell and Knightley that I was talking about earlier. If anything, Seeking a Friend could probably be labeled as a RomCom that relies heavily on Drama. It's very heavy and touching, but with light comedic elements to not make it feel like a burden to watch.The casting in the film was very well done. On the main front you have Carell and Knightley, but the movie is also filled with more than a few minor appearances. It would be a chore to list them all, so I'll just name a few. Along with the two leads you get appearances by Patton Oswalt, Martin Sheen, T.J. Miller, Melanie Lynskey, and Rob Corddry. Carell and Knightley, of course, steal the show, but it was nice to see a few familiar faces. Carell plays the same character we've seen him play before, but Knightley's performance helps add some spice to the mix. This has to be the first role I've seen her in where she wasn't playing a serious character, but she pulled it off wonderfully. After watching the movie I can't picture anyone else playing Penny.Finally, the music in this movie is fantastic. Between the soundtrack and the score, composed by Rob Simonsen & Jonathan Sadoff, your ears are constantly being serenaded by beautiful sounds. The score was beautifully composed, bringing an added touch of emotion to each and every scene. Then the soundtrack - which consists of music from The Beach Boys, The Hollies, and The Walker Brothers - seems to add this somber peacefulness to an otherwise dire situation. I don't know, it all just seemed to fit perfectly with what was going on in each scene.Overall Score: 8.75/10 - I find it difficult to sum up my feelings for Seeking a Friend. It was better than I anticipated while at the same time giving me something totally different than what I expected. I wasn't expecting it to move me the way it did, but I'm kind of glad it did. It's pure and it's honest and the ending is heartbreakingly beautiful. I can't recommend it enough.",4,8.75/10 - Wonderful,1372982400,"07 5, 2013",2013,5763,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.It', 'end', 'world', '100th', 'time', 'three',

1534021,A164D2I3CT3LLF,B007L6VRBM,J. Silberman,"[1, 1]","Steve Carell plays Dodge. It's a character he has played many times before: the nice guy who's been passed over. The good guy who's never got a break and who spends his life waiting for something wonderful to come along, which of course it never does - until now. Kiera Knightley plays Penny. A British expatriot living in the same apartment building with her doltish hippie boyfriend who sponges off of her. Penny and Dodge have absolutely nothing in common, until the arrival of an impending Extinction Level Event. An astroid is about to hit the earth ending life for most, perhaps all of humanity. People react the way you'd expect: the buttoned up types become instant hedonists, the crazies act even crazier and the depressives feel vindicated, but are even more depressed. Lastly, there are people like Dodge's housemaid, who continues to come to clean even as the planet is about to get pulverized. The film is about the unlikely pairing of Dodge and Penny, who have some adventures trying to connect with people from their past in distant places. There is a comforting ending notwithstanding the mass deaths of the entire cast at the end, which the director wisely leaves to our imaginations. This is a bittersweet film, with no pretensions of Oscar nominations. It's largely predictable. The real pleasure comes from the October-May relationship between Dodge and Penny. For him, it's the first time in his life he connects with someone he truly loves and is loved in return. For Penny, who's a bit of a ditz, Dodge's earthy pragmatism grounds her and gives her the comfort she needs, but didn't think she wanted. There is a juxtaposition of humor and pathos in this film, which works well and that's due entirely to Carell and Knightley. It's kind of nice to see a good guy end up with a sweet girl, even if it happens late in the game.

Swanson,"[4, 4]","Well, at least it's a mostly decent one.Seeking starts off really well, and the first half hour or so is truly funny, due almost entirely to Steve Carell. Yes, he plays the exact same likable schlub he plays in pretty much every movie or tv show he's in, but he's the master of it, so who can blame him. He sells it perfectly here, and his coworkers play off it well.The highlight of the film, and the last truly funny part, is the party, which has some classic lines courtesy of writer/director Scafaria. The bucket list and Radiohead lines are especially classic, and the dvd extras show Oswald riffing on some good bits, worth watching to be sure. (As are the brief making of and other outtakes; you can see that the fun feel of the film mirrored the making of it.)But then it all goes downhill pretty fast, mainly because Knightly is in way over her head comedically. So it turns into a pretty straight up chick flick, which is fine if you dig that, but I like more laughs mixed into that salad. There's a few, but precious few compared to the start here.But, there's a lot of heart, and even the truly silly ending shows that Scafaria is at heart a real romantic, and this is her baby, so well done to her for getting it made and having it be as good as it is at times. It's really a three star film as a whole, but she gets the fourth star for sheer good heartedness, which you can feel in the careful and thoughtful way the film feels as it winds into its sappy finale.All in all, a decent date movie, and for the truly great laughs in the opening and the rather sardonic take on modren American office and suburban life, worth watching for those who like their romance mixed with some occasionally edgy laughs.",4,At the end of the world there's a...chick flick?,1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,1718,"['Well', 'least', 'mostly', 'decent', 'one.Seeking', 'starts', 'really', 'well', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'so', 'truly', 'funny', 'due', 'almost', 'entirely', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Yes', 'exact', 'same', 'likable', 'schlub', 'pretty', 'much', 'movie', 'tv', 'show', 'master', 'who', 'can', 'blame', 'perfectly', 'here', 'coworkers', 'play', 'well.The', 'highlight', 'film', 'last', 'truly', 'funny', 'part', 'party', 'classic', 'lines', 'courtesy', 'writer/director', 'Scafaria', 'bucket', 'list', 'Radiohead', 'lines', 'are', 'especially', 'classic', 'dvd', 'show', 'Oswald', 'riffing', 'good', 'bits', 'worth', 'watching', 'be', 'sure', 'are', 'brief', 'making', 'other', 'outtakes', 'can', 'see', 'fun', 'feel', 'film', 'mirrored', 'making', 'then', 'downhill', 'pretty', 'fast', 'mainly', 'Knightly', 'way', 'head', 'comedically', 'pretty', 'straight', 'up', 'chick', 'flick', 'fine', 'dig', 'like', 'more', 'laughs', 'mixed', 'salad', 'few', 'precious', 'few', 'compared', 'start', 'here.But', 'lot', 'heart', 'even', 'truly', 'silly', 'ending', 'shows', 'Scafaria', 'heart', 'real', 'romantic', 'baby', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'getting', 'made', 'having', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'times', 'really', 'three', 'star', 'film', 'whole', 'fourth', 'star', 'sheer', 'good', 'heartedness', 'can', 'feel', 'careful', 'thoughtful', 'way', 'film', 'feels', 'sappy', 'finale.All', 'decent', 'date', 'movie', 'truly', 'great', 'laughs', 'opening', 'rather', 'sardonic', 'take', 'modren', 'American', 'office', 'suburban', 'life', 'worth', 'watching', 'who', 'like', 'romance', 'mixed', 'occasionally', 'edgy', 'laughs']",N/A

Power ""nlp trainer""","[1, 1]","Seeking a Friend for the end of the World was written and directed by Lorene Scafaria, who also wrote Nick and Norah's Infinite playlist, which I vaguely remember as a dorky coming of age movie with surreal overtones. This is her first directing venture.The end of the world has become a common theme in recent years sometimes post apocalytic such as [ASIN:B002ZG997C The Book of Eli]] with Denzel Washington, or pre apocalyptic such as Von Trier's Melancholia, Emmerich's blockbuster 2012, an action movie on a grand scale, or my personal favoriteAnother Earth (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)[Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy]in which another earth appears in the night sky but may not be apocalyptic at all.A news announcement of terrifying proportions sets in course a sequence of events in the life of Peterson Dodge played by Steve Carell. His wife leaves him immediately. Peoples behavior changes. He meets Keira Knightley's character, somewhat of a free spirit.Both initially have plans which do not include each other. He wants to reconnect with a high school sweetheart, and she wants to go back to her family, except the airlines are shut down.Yet, as time goes by and they help each other to get what they really want, they realise they both want the same thing, and that thing is closer than they realised.To tell you more would be unfair. SFEW has good and weak points. It's engaging enough and I think could have been better. I wish there was more oomph in the movie. Carell plays his character Peterson Dodge as subdued and perhaps a little depressed at the beginning which is understandable yet there is no huge contrast in his behavior later in the movie when things are going better and they are having their adventures.Two emotionally poignant scenes later in the movie made the entire experience worthwhile for me. After he carries carries her sleeping, and a later surprise. I thought wow.While I would not give this movie as high a rating as say Another Earth or Book Of Eli both of which I liked better, if you like the premise and the potential romantic theme you may find this to be worth your time.

1534056,A3U3BEZMH3F01Q,B007L6VRBM,maskirovka,"[0, 0]","I knew I would be seeing this movie when I first saw the trailer last year.  A romantic comedy-drama set in the twilight of humanity that stars everyman Steve Carell and equally appealing Keira Knightley was irresistible to me.  So I'm glad I got to see it, and I'm giving it four stars because it has some truly poignant and heartbreaking moments mixed in with some elements that didn't really work for me.The premise is simple:  an asteroid is going to hit the Earth.  The last effort to prevent that from happening has failed.  The human race has three weeks before Armageddon.  Steve Carell plays an insurance company employee who watches with amazement and disbelief as things that he thought would last forever --like his unhappy marriage-- dissolve.  People react to the forthcoming end of days in a variety of ways, mostly seeming to indulge in all the vices they might have deprived themselves of if the world had been a going concern.Carell's character is thrown together with Knightley's.  She's a kooky British expatriate some people have dismissed as just another ""manic pixie dream girl"" (but I don't agree with that characterization...after all, she's a young woman and some people really are any and a bit off-kilter).  They both go on a quest together before their lives end and somewhere along the line begin to fall in love.The movie had some great elements to it:1.  Some of the depictions of how people reacted to the situation of the world coming to an end were hilarious and I could readily see them happening.2.  Carell and Knightley had some genuine chemistry together despite the fact that he is old enough to be her father.  The last scene where he comforts her as doom descends on high is heartfelt.3.  There is a nice scene where Knightley talks on the phone to her parents in Britain where she shows how good an actress she is since she's projecting emotion and really makes you believe she's saying goodbye to her family (when in reality, the actress is just speaking into the phone and pretending).4.  Steve Carell really is well-cast as an ""everyman"" who can't quite believe what is happening in front of him.5.  The bit about the way that Carell's character's cleaning lady kept showing up to clean his apartment and said she'd see him ""next Tuesday"" (after impact) was pretty insightful.  Some people really would just live in denial about their forthcoming end until the end.But there were some structural and conceptual problems with the story as well...&lt;spoilers>1.  Since the world is going to end and the two lead characters along with the rest of the human race are going to die, it's kind of hard to get attached to them (I did a bit but it wasn't as complete as characters in other stories).  After all, even in the movie ""Titanic,"" only one character and the love affair itself were doomed...Kate Winslet's character lived.2.  I couldn't help but think that the movie overplayed the idea of everyone descending into an orgy of sex, drugs, and violence.  I'm sure a lot of people would do that, but I have a feeling that a lot of people would be trying very hard to survive the disaster; others would be trying to get things right in their lives; and many others would simply spend time with their families until disaster struck.  Late in the movie, we see Carell and Knightley's characters spending time with other people on a nice beach...no orgies, drug taking, violence...just people trying to enjoy some of the good things before the end.  I wish they had shown more stuff like that happening in the movie along with the madness.3.  Another thing that bothered me about this story was the whole idea that the human race would more or less give up on trying to ward off disaster after the space shuttle blew up as was announced in the opening scene of the movie.  I really would like to think that the various nations of this world would be doing anything and everything until the very last minute to try to keep the asteroid from slamming into the Earth.  For example, what about the thousands of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in the US, Russia, China, and other countries?  I would hope they'd used to destroy the asteroid.4.  Another thing I didn't buy was the sudden announcement that the asteroid was arriving early.  I'm not an astronomer, but I would imagine that if an asteroid was heading toward the Earth on a collision course, it would be entirely predictable about when it would strike (with maybe some slight time changes but not suddenly arriving a week early like it did in the movie).5.  A minor annoyance was that I don't think the aircraft that Martin Sheen's character (who played Carell's character's father) would have been able to reach the UK from the East Coast.6.  I could buy the idea of Carell and Knightley's characters coming to care for each other a lot given the time that they spent together and the circumstances they were in, but some of the ""you were the love of my life"" declarations seemed a bit unlikely.&lt;end spoilers>But despite these flaws, I'm glad I watched the movie.  People who find the issue of what would happen on Earth if a global catastrophe loomed interesting might find these two books very well worth reading:Shiva DescendingLucifer's Hammer&lt;my alternate ending>I can't help but wonder whether the movie would have been better if at the last minute, a last ditch effort to divert or destroy the asteroid had succeeded.  I think the movie would have had some fun with showing how people adjusted to the fact that they were not all going to die and came to terms with the things they had done and said when they did.  And it would have been nice to have seen Carell and Knightley's characters still together somehow.So in my mind, that's what happened.",4,"Poignant romantic comedy-drama ""on the road to

With a huge asteroid hurtling toward the planet, humans have 3 weeks to say their goodbyes and plan for their ultimate demise.  Steve Carell reprises his sad-sack persona as Dodge an insurance salesman.  When he and his wife hear the news in the car, she jumps out and runs the other way.  Now alone, Dodge meets a neighbor he never knew.Penny (an adorable Keira Knightly) has just broken up with her live-in boyfriend and is devastated given the time left.  Penny is a bit loopy and has been hording some of Dodge's misdirected mail.  This includes a letter sent to him by his long lost high school sweetheart wanting to reconnect.  The two make a pact (Penny has a car) to search out the woman.  In return, Dodge has a contact that can fly her to her parent's town (commercial air travel has been shut down).  The middle section of the film is pretty standard movie road-trippin' with a funny stop at a T.G.I.

As one of her generation's most talented actresses she manages to pull of this transition with deft agility.  When she gets access to a military satellite phone she calls her family.

In the first minute of the movie we see Dodge (played by Steve Carell) and his wife sitting in the car, listening to the radio announcement that asteroid 'Matilda' cannot be stopped and will hit earth in 3 weeks, ending life as we know it. Dodge's wife looks at him, and then leaves the car, literally running away from him. What a beginning! Dodge eventually meets Penny (played by Kiera Knightley), and regardless of their age difference, they strike a friendship. Dodge and Penny hit the road, among others to look up Dodge's HS sweetheart and to find a plane for penny so she can rejoin her family in England. I don't want to give away much more of the plot, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out, but let's just say things don't pan out exactly as Dodge and Penny thought they would.This is an outstanding movie from start to finish. In the midst of all the numbing summer blockbusters that Hollywood unleaches upon us, here's actually a movie that actually speaks to me. At times I laughed, at times I teared up, and the movie went by in the blink of an eye.  I don't know that Steve Carell has ever been better than here, playing the ""Joe Six-Pack"" average guy with even more restraint (and that's a compliment). Kudos also to Kiera Kightley. Likewise for the oustanding soundtrack (I may never listen to the Hollies ""The Air That I Breathe"" in the same way again).

1534094,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B007L6VRBM,RMurray847,"[3, 3]","SEEKING A FRIEND FOR THE END OF THE WORLD is an odd, quirky and touching film.  It is NOT a raucous comedy (despite the presence of Steve Carrell and folks like Rod Cordry), but it is pretty funny throughout.  It is NOT a romance in a traditional sense, yet it is an unusual love story.The movie starts as the world learns that the last efforts to stop a huge asteroid from slamming into it have failed.  Three weeks is all the planet has remaining.  Immediately upon hearing the doomsday proclamation, Steve Carrell's wife leaves him.  We learn their marriage hasn't been great for a long time...but the sudden abandonment leaves Carrell a bit stunned.  We sense he has probably been unhappy for a long time, because he continues to go through the motions of his life even as chaos slowly descends around him.  It's as though the world has finally caught up to HIS condition...fatalistic and seeing no real reason to care about anything.Then he meets his next door neighbor (Keira Knightley) a British girl who has just broken up with her boyfriend, and with the end of the world coming, wishes she could get back to Britain to see her parents one last time (which is tough, because airlines are grounded).  The two head out into the world, with Carrell offering to get Knightley to someone he knows that owns a plane...and her offering to help him find his ""first love""...the girl that got away.Along the way they have many amusing encounters...most notably at a Chili's-like restaurant that has decided to ""get creative"" with its menu.  They encounter zaniness, they encounter suicide, and they encounter families that are simply together to enjoy their last few days of beauty and togetherness.  And not surprisingly, a bond grows between these two unlikely companions.This is a thoughtful and sad movie.  Yes, there were plenty of funny moments, but writer/director Lorene Scafaria is interested in much more.  Trying to make a movie about the end of the world is daunting.  HOW would people act?  What kinds of crazy things would happen?  Scafaria has actually come up with a wide variety of possibilities and she gives us little peeks at each of those, mostly through Carrell's bemused and sad eyes.  (The best is his maid, who keeps coming to work and gets upset when Carrell tells her she doesn't need to clean his apartment anymore.)  But in the end, her wry, funny and sometimes affecting musings on how human along America's east coast might react in the face of the apocalypse are only background to the plight of her two leads.  Their problems, in the great scheme of things, are pretty small...but we learn to care for each of them deeply.There is the potential for quite a ""creepiness"" factor in partnering Carrell and Knightley.  But Carrell gives one of his best ""serious"" performances here, and although Knightley is occasionally a bit antic and scattered, she generally matches him.  Their relationship, as it progresses, feels logical and right...and we root for them, even as we might worry that Carrell is becoming a bit too much like a Woody Allen character (as in, interested in women far too young).  They make it work as best as a relationship like this could work.And in the end, I found the movie to be surprisingly effective and touching.  Clearly, this movie will not be for everyone (as its poor box office performance attests), because it is very unconventional in many ways.  But I liked it very much because it WAS surprising.  Scafaria was bursting with ideas for this film, yet it never feels cluttered.  She is able to make most of her observations or assumptions quickly and adroitly.  The film is also full of cameos from some great actors (Patton Oswalt, Connie Britton, Derek Luke, William Petersen and especially Melanie Lynskey, who is terrific in her little role)...each of these experienced performers (and more) are skillful enough to take their brief moments and make something of them...to add to the experience rather than just creating ""oh, look, he's in the movie"" moments.  SEEKING A FRIEND... is a low-key delight, original, well-acted, well-written, funny and affecting.

1534105,AQ65579F7SYVX,B007L6VRBM,SaosinEngaged,"[4, 5]","(Please note this review does contain spoilers, but they are vague. You won't know exactly what happens, but you'll grasp the premise including the final scene, so please take note)I normally have a great deal of understanding for differing opinions of various films. Except here. I can only reasonably conclude that people who detest this film either have no connection to their emotions, or more likely, are conditioned to bawk at any film romance as a manipulative contrivance.Seeking a Friend for the End of the World is a film I viewed with no expectations other than hoping to be at least somewhat entertained. I certainly didn't expect to be emotionally floored, holding back the welling tears as the final scene unfolds and then...fades.The film's weakest parts are thankfully in the first third. After that, the film picks up steam and emotional gravitas almost exponentially, scene by scene as it transitions from black comedy to an absolutely devastating love story. I'd argue both Carrel and Knightley give the performances of their careers, as they build a kind of unexpected chemistry you will NOT see coming during the film's initial third.The basic premise, of course, is that the world is ending. What does one do if given only weeks to live? Better yet, what SHOULD one do? Carrel's life is on the outs, regardless of the asteroid but is given the chance to rekindle a lost romance with an old flame. Knightley's quirky optimistic nature is also threatened by her desire for something more meaningful than her self-absorbed boyfriend, and her very understandable desire to see her parents once more, back in England. Through comedic yet understandable events of the impending apocalypse, the unlikely pair are brought together and decide to help one another attain their final wishes.To its credit, the film never submits to cliched, saccharine rom-com norms. It's much more intent to layer a kind of subtle propulsion of depth and charm, once again scene by scene, as Carrel and Knightley start realizing the only answer to what to do with the last weeks of their life is be around one another. During the final act,(after Carrel realizes the only thing he's searching for has been with him the entire time) Carrel offers a gesture of breathtaking selflessness that you won't see coming, and you're left wondering how the film could possibly end. Thematically tying it all together, Knightley returns by also sacrificing her initial intentions. Her emotions pouring out of her eyes and body language as she realizes the soul mate she's never had has found her only days before the world is to end.I've mentioned it once, but trust me. The final scene is devastating yet absolutely beautiful. Purely, subtly, charmingly spellbinding. The pair lay in bed, as the asteroid makes its final approach. Knightley beginning to tremble with fear, her brimming optimism completely gone, replaced with only the realization that she's found real love much too late; completely juxtaposed by Carrel's tonal shift to a stoic guardian, tenderly caressing her hair while gazing so intently, it's almost as if he's looking through her, all to happy to have finally found someone to give his empty life meaning. It's touching. It's heartbreaking. It's everything a romance should be on film, and here it's so affecting I had to fight back the tears.Somehow these two found an on screen chemistry (without seeing the movie, it seems impossible for Steve Carrel and Keira Knightley to have romantic chemistry) that carries the film, propelled by stellar performances and motivated by highest of stakes. If the world is ending and you've only weeks to live, you best spend it meaningfully. The explosion of emotion the final scene portrays, and in fact the entire film, is simply profound.Highly, highly recommended. Check all preconceived notions at the door.

1534108,AR1T36GLLAFFX,B007L6VRBM,Scott FS,"[2, 5]","OK, the world is going to end in three weeks, destroyed by an asteroid Mathilde.  (There is indeed as asteroid named Mathilde, but it's only (!) 31 miles wide.  Why the size inflation?)  Most people seem to be unsure of what to do, though the rioting you'd expect in the cities does take place.  Some people continue to go to work cleaning houses or selling insurance for the coming catastrophe.  (Though it's never made clear how this huge this 70 mile-wide killer asteroid is going to impact life on the planet, though some believe survivalists who think they can stay in a bomb shelter and form a new civilization with what's left.  Which is it?)The problem with the film is two-fold.  The largest problem (and pretty much fatal to the film) is there is very, very little chemistry between the two leads, Steve Carell and Keira Knightly.  They play neighbors in an apartment complex who really don't know each other well at all.  (This is a tip-off, I suppose because there should have been at least a spark between the two when urthey lived near one another, before all the sturm-und-drang of the end of the world stuff.  But no, not at all that I could see).  The second problem is there is little romantic comedy when played against the 'end of the world'.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't find the death of millions to be conducive to lots of jokes and light banter between characters.  A difficult problem that the film just can't surmount.Now I know this is not a documentary film, or a serious drama; it's supposed to be a romantic comedy of sorts, and a 'let's settle old scores family' film, but in order for me to buy into the film, I have to know how big of a threat the asteroid is going to be. Let's just say that it's the end of ole planet Earth.  And there is some reference made to a non-existent space shuttle trying to save the planet that fails (didn't the script writers get the memo??? There is no space shuttle program any more!).There are some pleasures to be had by the film; first and foremost, it does get you thinking.  If the world is going to end in a month, what would YOU do?  Have end-of-the-world flings?  Try something new?  Leave your spouse for an old lover?  The supporting characters are adequate to file out the film.  They include William Peterson (CSI: Las Vegas) in a shocking role, and Adam Brody as the apparent lover of Penny, Keira Knightly's characterSo is it worth the $10.00 at the multiplex to see?  I'd say no.  If you want to watch an OK film, wait until it comes out on DVD.  There are some interesting ways people deal with such distressing news.  But the power is on until the very end, even television is there if you are obsessed with knowing how much time you have left.Two-and-a-half stars for 'Seeking a Friend for the End of the World'.

This jewel of creative thought was shamelessly pulled from the theaters before it could find an audience.  Drivel and schlock fill the cineplex and apparently there's no room for something different.  The early reviews were mixed and mostly centered on what it wasn't, causing its early ouster. I feel compelled to defend what it is.This is a darkly comic yet heartfelt look at other side of a pending apocalypse.  Blockbusters like Armageddon tell what our bigger than life heroes might do to save the day, but what about the rest of us, just waiting for the end?  What do we do?  What would you do?The story is about a sad sack who laments his misspent life and flighty homesick free spirit, thrown together in the final days.  Each deciding to help the other they embark on a quest to find his lost love and get her back home.  The genius is in their encounters and the back round satire, both subtle and not.  The last third is for anyone with a beating heart and the ending is spot on perfect.I found the critiques totally off the mark.  One complaint was about its ""jarring tonal shifts."" Yes, the end of the world can be a bit unnerving.  Some didn't like Steve Carell, but nobody plays a deflated sole better. And there is no shortage of Keira Knightley detractors. Well, they are just flat out wrong.  Think Keira and Steve don't belong together?  They don't. That is entirely the point. This movie makes you feel.  It makes you think.

And after watching this, I see why they did this movie.So the movie starts with a 40 year old Carell and his wife sitting in a car, listening to a newscast that the shuttle mission sent to destroy asteroid Mathilda, has failed, and that the world will end in 3 weeks. Carell's wife looks at him like he wasted her life, and runs from the car. That simple 60 seconds sets the tone for the rest of the film. After wasting a week moping, Carell meets Knightly, his downstairs neighbor who has a `long sleep' disorder. From the start, they seem to be total opposites. She is flighty, and he is a calm, suppressed man mired in a suppressed job selling insurance. If I give you ANY details, it ruins the desire to see this film. Let's just say, they find they fill holes in each other, and as they road trip to see people before the end, they discover they fill those holes. Watching them grow is like a fine wine....it just gets better.I am having a hard time reviewing this movie because I loved it (telling everything ruins it), and the viewer really needs to experience for themselves, how you get totally drawn into Carell and Kightly. The even pace of Carell and the oddness of Khightly (and trust me, she is odd) is like a goulash that finally comes together, but only with days left before the asteroid strike.One of the best scenes is the party where Carell's friends try to set him up with an easy chick after his wife leaves, and he won' go for it because he `isn't ready'. The other is when Carell and  Knightly go to an ex-boyfriend's of Knightly's who has a titanium bomb shelter believes he and his friends will repopulate the world after the strike. The irony being, they are all men, and the world be be scoured. This movie is filled with irony of how people try to cope with the end of all things.I give the writers big kudos for not having the `Hollywood Ending'. Trust me, the last 60 seconds of this movie, will bring you to tears, even if you are a strong person. It's worth it for the message it brings. Life is too short. If you find what brings you happiness, keep it, and keep it until all things end.Again, it's hard for me to do a review and give away all the nuances of a movie.

After a last ditch attempt to save the world fails people of Earth are told that they only have a few weeks left before the end of the world will take place.

Dodge (Carell) wants to return to his first love and see her again for the first time in a long time. Penny (Knightley) wants to find a way to return to her family back in England.

This is one of those movies that make you think how you would react in a situation like this but also one that is hard to imagine yourself in.

At least that's how I felt. There has been quite a few end of the world movies that have come out in the last few years and I would compare this one more to ""Melencholia"" then to any of the others.

Think about it.The first thing we hear during the film is that an asteroid is headed toward Earth and the last effort made to stop it has failed. We hear this over a car radio with a man and woman in front listening. The man, Dodge (played by Steve Carrell) says nothing as his wife (played by Carrell's actual wife Nancy Carrell) leaves the car without a word. Dodge, an insurance salesman, returns to work the next day for lack of a better idea. The office is nearly empty and, while starting his car to return home, a coworker lands on Dodge's windshield. His friends have embraced their fate by throwing a party in their home filled with drugs, alcohol, and free love. Dodge flees the party in terror and returns to his empty apartment. On another night, he wanders a local park, drinks Windex and passes out. When he wakes, he finds a dog tethered to his foot with the word ""sorry"" written on a Post-It note on his sweater. He takes the dog home and reminisces about a lost love until he's interrupted by his neighbor crying on the fire escape. The neighbor, Penny (played by Keira Knightley), had just broken up with her boyfriend who caused her to miss the last plane home to her family in England. Despite their proximity, they've never spoken. So Penny (Knightley) takes the opportunity and hands Dodge some mail  that was meant for him but placed in her mailbox. Among the many letters he didn't get, there's a letter from the same former girlfriend Dodge had been thinking about. A riot breaks out that evening causing Dodge to leave town and invite Penny along, claiming he knows someone with a plane who can bring her to her family. Along the way they encounter others making a final journey while they, meaning Dodge and Penny, develop a close relationship of their own.This is not your typical comedy, obviously. Nor is it your typical end of the world film. In your typical end of the world film, e.g. Armageddon, Deep Impact, 2012, the world doesn't end. The last great hope of humanity works and everyone lives happily ever after. And your typical comedy isn't this gruesome. I call it that not because gory images are a constant in the film, but because they appear unexpectedly and startle the other characters and the viewers.

That's exactly what ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" is trying to do, with a story about a middle-aged man Dodge (Steve Carell) and Penny (Keira Knightley) a young British woman living in the same building, as a gigantic asteroid is heading towards the Earth. With only 21 days left to live, Dodge and Penny hit the road to seek Dodge's high school sweetheart.No, the quirky little film is not ""Melancholia,"" and some call ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" an ""apocalyptic romantic comedy."" There are not many ""apocalyptic romantic comedies"" out there, and not surprisingly, Lorene Scafaria's feature debut as director (she also wrote the screenplay) was not a big hit at the box office, despite the inclusion of stars Carell and Knightley. So is the film that bad?No, I will not call it a bad film, and there are some touching moments and great soundtrack music (including Walker Brothers), but besides its lengthy and unappealing title, ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" has several problems. For one thing, the director seems unable to decide where the film is going. Part road movie, the film is too episodic, introducing many characters (some by Nancy Carell and Martin Sheen in a cameo role), but none of these episodes is really interesting. The film's tone shifts restlessly from offbeat comedy to bittersweet romance, leaving almost no emotional impact. Genre-bending is one thing; indecisiveness is another.Some viewers may think the unlikely pair of Steve Carell and Keira Knightley will not work. Actually, it does, though not perfectly, and I couldn't help thinking that with different players or director their relationship could have been more credible. To me Dodge and Penny look more like a brother and sister - or just friends.

There never seems to be enough wondering by humanity when it will actually happen, if it will happen in our lifetime, and how we'll get through it.  Humanity will either go crazy or it will do a hell of a lot of reflection and repentance before life ends.Whatever the outcome, Seeking a Friend was a different take on two people's lives who cross during the end and fall in love.  The usual scenes of despondency, why bother caring about anything, and riots are in the film. Each character reflects about choices, family members, and lost loves as they prepare for the inevitable.The movie really didn't move me until the end when they are in bed waiting to die. Their position reminds me of the two skeletons discovered by archeologists in Italy facing each other as they perish - the lovers of Valdaro.

After a long night and a curious mind for alternative comedy, Seeking a Friend seemed like a good option not in preparation for last year's apocalypse but for my personal amusement. The trailers and its concept promised quite a lot for a wild ride but the film as a whole was far from spectacular. No offense to the director/writer but this film lacks the kind of satirical bite and chaos it could have took. Instead, it takes a very liberal, slow-paced, disorganised, and disoriented approach to an escape plot with a cold Steve Carrell and a tricky-to-point-out Keira Knightley. It does not know exactly where it is going other than include random jokes, too much drama and depression, and ambiguity. The saving grace that the film holds are few but mostly involve its ambitions to have the kind of indie/hipster film spirit of its core and some of the occasional and holistic naturalism of its dialogue and humour in the first 10-15 minutes. In many ways, it is probably one of the most honest and surreal comedies ever done and might be one of the most challenging and experimental films done too in recent cinema. While I do not recommend apocalypse films due to the pseudo-scientific basis and superficiality behind it, Seeking a Friend does not take itself so seriously about proving something more than lampooning and illustrating chaos through human eyes. But among its pluses, the negatives weigh even larger on the scale. It is hard to recommend a film like this when one realises its objectives can seem tiring once it reaches a certain point in the film. Dark comedies generally tend to have an impact on presenting humour amid disturbing, forbidden and tragic situations but this film only shows its grim overtones incidentally soon sliding back to boredom. If you want subtle comedy and entertainment, watch Doomsday Preppers instead.""",2,A surprisingly weak effort overall even if daring and emotionally realistic.

1534145,AP3B615GM191G,B007L6VRBM,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[3, 6]","The beauty of a movie like ""Seeking A Friend For The End Of The World"" is that it can go in so many different directions.  It could be a high drama, a comedy, an adventure romp, or any number of different scenarios.  What is required, however, is a little bit of focus to make sure that the right area (or blend of areas) is present in order to make sure that the characters and setting do not get ""lost in the shuffle"".  Unfortunately, ""Seeking"" lacks such focus.For a basic plot summary, this movie is set in a future American where the world is going to inevitably be destroyed by a very large meteor.  After being dumped by his wife after hearing the news, Dodge (Steve Carell) is lost in life and decides to go visit his ""first love"" that got away.  Before he can do so, however, he meets Penny (Keira Knightley), who throws a major kink (for better or worse) in his plans as the clock continues ticking towards doomsday.While ""Seeking"" has great potential to be a solid film, it ends up failing because of its complete lack of focus.  Director Lorene Scafaria doesn't seem to know what kind of movie she wants to make here, and as a result any potential ""good stuff"" is lost in the shuffle.  For example...-The ""elephant in the room"" (the end of the world) isn't taken all that seriously and works better as a comedic bit than anything substantial in terms of drama.-It could work as a comedy, but Carell is given such conflicting material that his character comes off as a mix of boorish and pathetic (e.g. nothing all that funny).-The movie could have even worked strictly as a character drama, if not for the total unbelievability of the Carell/Knightley pairing and the fact that the first half (if not two-thirds) of the picture fritters away any chance of meaningful character development.Basically, ""Seeking"" is the kind of movie you get when you try to be too ""artsy"" and don't solidify your focus.  The casting choice of Knightley (queen of the ""artsy"" movies) only solidifies this line of thinking.  If you are looking for anything near Carell's earlier ""Crazy Stupid Love"" in terms of a mesh of comedy/drama/emotion, you won't find it here.",2,"What Happens When You Make A Movie Too ""Artsy""",1355356800,"12 13, 2012",2012,2157,"['beauty', 'movie', 'Seeking', 'Friend', 'End', 'World', 'can', 'go', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'directions', 'could', 'be', 'high', 'drama', 'comedy', 'adventure', 'romp', 'number', 'different', 'scenarios', 'What', 'required', 'however', 'little', 'bit', 'focus', 'make', 'sure', 'right', 'area', 'blend', 'areas', 'present', 'order', 'make', 'sure', 'characters', 'setting', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'lost', 'shuffle', 'Unfortunately', 'Seeking', 'lacks', 'such', 'focus.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'movie', 'set', 'future', 'American', 'where', 'world', 'going', 'inevitably', 'be', 'destroyed', 'very', 'large', 'meteor', 'being', 'dumped', 'wife', 'hearing', 'news', 'Dodge', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'lost', 'life', 'decides', 'go', 'visit', 'first', 'love', 'got', 'away', 'can', 'do', 'so', 'however', 'Penny', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'who', 'major', 'kink', 'better', 'worse', 'plans', 'clock', 'ticking', 'towards', 'Seeking', 'great', 'potential', 'be', 'solid', 'film', 'up', 'failing', 'complete', 'lack', 'focus', 'Director', 'Lorene', 'Scafaria', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'movie', 'make', 'here', 'result', 'potential', 'good', 'stuff', 'lost', 'shuffle', 'example', 'elephant', 'room', 'end', 'world', ""n't"", 'taken', 'seriously', 'better', 'comedic', 'bit', 'anything', 'substantial', 'terms', 'drama.-It', 'could', 'work', 'comedy', 'Carell', 'given', 'such', 'conflicting', 'material', 'character', 'off', 'mix', 'boorish', 'pathetic', 'e.g', 'nothing', 'funny', '.-The', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'even', 'worked', 'strictly', 'character', 'drama', 'not', 'total', 'unbelievability', 'Carell/Knightley', 'pairing', 'fact', 'first', 'half', 'not', 'two-thirds', 'picture', 'away', 'chance', 'meaningful', 'character', 'development.Basically', 'Seeking', 'kind', 'movie', 'get', 'when', 'try', 'be', 'too', 'artsy', 'do', ""n't"", 'solidify', 'focus', 'casting', 'choice', 'Knightley', 'queen', 'artsy', 'movies', 'only', 'line', 'thinking', 'are', 'looking', 'anything', 'Carell', 'earlier', 'Crazy', 'Stupid', 'Love', 'terms', 'mesh', 'comedy/drama/emotion', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here']",N/A
