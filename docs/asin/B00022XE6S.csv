822050,A1ALOIPRR8Q06J,B00022XE6S,"2 cents ""meaningless memes""","[2, 2]","It's a David Mamet movie. Enough said.Well I'll ramble on for a moment here because I do like this movie.If this flick was supposed to be based on real events -or ""real events"", or had a message, or was popular with rightwingers, or--God spare us--moronically depicted torture as a vital and reliable way to gather informationa and save countless lives from immanent doom--then it would suck in my book. I have very mixed feelings, you might say, on movies depicting the military and spies and lots of the stuff that goes with that like murdering people. But just like any red blooded male and American the dark and  unsurprising truth is I love watching violence with guns and explosions and bad a** alpha-males doing the impossible. (I don't remember explosions in this one though.)Basically SPARTAN can be viewed as a kind of cinematic version of the TV series ""24"".Val Kilmer is excellent in this role as a sort of Delta Force type commando or super-elite agent. It has the guy who was in TV's ""Married with Children"" playing head of the FBI or something and he is fantastic. You wouldn't believe how real he is as a take charge alpha-male head of a huge and powerful governmental agency. Everybody is good.As far as the plot goes, basically the president's daughter is missing and it ain't clear where she is because she is missing and of course you don't know who has her or why. And you also don't know what some people that you'd think don't know anything actually do or who is up to what or why. A web of decite and misinformation and so on. Who's playin' and who's getting played? Bottom line, what's special about this stylish David Mamet tale is, of course, the dialog. It can be over-the-top at times as is sometimes the case with his stuff, but it's still great and I like how it's laid on thick. And Val Kilmer is the man.I highly recommend SPARTAN and all David Mamet movies.",4,"""where's the girl""",1229299200,"12 15, 2008",2008,1891,"['David', 'Mamet', 'movie', 'Enough', 'said.Well', ""'ll"", 'ramble', 'moment', 'here', 'do', 'movie.If', 'flick', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', 'real', 'events', '-or', 'real', 'events', 'had', 'message', 'was', 'popular', 'rightwingers', 'God', 'spare', 'moronically', 'depicted', 'torture', 'vital', 'reliable', 'way', 'gather', 'informationa', 'save', 'countless', 'lives', 'immanent', 'doom', 'then', 'would', 'suck', 'book', 'have', 'very', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'might', 'say', 'movies', 'depicting', 'military', 'spies', 'lots', 'stuff', 'like', 'murdering', 'people', 'just', 'red', 'blooded', 'male', 'American', 'dark', 'unsurprising', 'truth', 'love', 'watching', 'violence', 'guns', 'explosions', 'bad', 'a**', 'alpha-males', 'doing', 'impossible', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'explosions', 'one', 'though', 'Basically', 'SPARTAN', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'kind', 'cinematic', 'version', 'TV', 'series', '24', '.Val', 'Kilmer', 'excellent', 'role', 'sort', 'Delta', 'Force', 'type', 'commando', 'super-elite', 'agent', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'TV', 'Married', 'Children', 'playing', 'head', 'FBI', 'something', 'fantastic', 'would', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'real', 'take', 'charge', 'alpha-male', 'head', 'huge', 'powerful', 'governmental', 'agency', 'Everybody', 'good.As', 'far', 'plot', 'basically', 'president', 'daughter', 'missing', 'ai', ""n't"", 'clear', 'where', 'missing', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'why', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'people', ""'d"", 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'actually', 'do', 'who', 'up', 'what', 'why', 'web', 'decite', 'misinformation', 'so', 'Who', 'playin', 'who', 'getting', 'played', 'Bottom', 'line', 'what', 'special', 'stylish', 'David', 'Mamet', 'tale', 'course', 'dialog', 'can', 'be', 'over-the-top', 'times', 'sometimes', 'case', 'stuff', 'still', 'great', 'like', 'how', 'laid', 'thick', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'man.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'SPARTAN', 'David', 'Mamet', 'movies']",N/A
822051,A1V7FLEMLZ3A0I,B00022XE6S,"Acolin ""Acolin""","[2, 2]","[...]The amazing writer and now director David Mamet returns to write and direct an 2004 entertaining domestic spy/crime drama thriller with Val Kilmer. Mamet has a legacy of some truly great movies, including Heist (2001/I), Ronin (1998), The Spanish Prisoner (1997), Hoffa (1992), the awesome Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) (play & screenplay), House of Games (1987), The Verdict (1982) and the incredible remake of The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981).Val Kilmer does very good job in this one as the stoic undercover operative, although his brief one-line observations about the state of man and displays of emotion seem out of place. Anybody who has seen his incredible performance as Gay Perry in the recent and engaging crime drama Kiss, Kiss Bang, Bang, knows he is amazingly capable in this genre.The script crackles with Mamet's trademark dialogue, which in this tightly woven genre fits - pay attention, the plot twists depend NOT on the steady stream of action, but on the character observations of how things don't fit together. Excellent support cast all round, with roles changing as the plot evolves.  Critics argue that the plot is too complicated/clever, but this was entertaining, with overtones of political conspiracy that make you realize how easy it is for the truly powerful to manipulate events.I thought the music and action at the end could be tighten up a notch - there isn't a big money-shot explosion or anything to close the movie - just another plot twist. For a more explosive ride, with a more entertaining character, and a much simpler drug-induced and graphic plot, see the recently released Crank - excellent action/adventure from the Transporter man.",4,A great pair,1161648000,"10 24, 2006",2006,1685,"['[', 'amazing', 'writer', 'now', 'director', 'David', 'Mamet', 'write', 'direct', '2004', 'entertaining', 'domestic', 'spy/crime', 'drama', 'thriller', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Mamet', 'legacy', 'truly', 'great', 'movies', 'including', 'Heist', '2001/I', 'Ronin', '1998', 'Spanish', 'Prisoner', '1997', 'Hoffa', '1992', 'awesome', 'Glengarry', 'Glen', 'Ross', '1992', 'play', 'screenplay', 'House', 'Games', '1987', 'Verdict', '1982', 'incredible', 'remake', 'Postman', 'Always', 'Rings', 'Twice', '1981', '.Val', 'Kilmer', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'one', 'stoic', 'undercover', 'operative', 'brief', 'one-line', 'observations', 'state', 'man', 'displays', 'emotion', 'seem', 'place', 'Anybody', 'who', 'seen', 'incredible', 'performance', 'Gay', 'Perry', 'recent', 'engaging', 'crime', 'drama', 'Kiss', 'Kiss', 'Bang', 'Bang', 'amazingly', 'capable', 'genre.The', 'script', 'crackles', 'Mamet', 'trademark', 'dialogue', 'tightly', 'woven', 'genre', 'pay', 'attention', 'plot', 'twists', 'depend', 'NOT', 'steady', 'stream', 'action', 'character', 'observations', 'how', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'together', 'Excellent', 'support', 'cast', 'round', 'roles', 'changing', 'plot', 'Critics', 'argue', 'plot', 'too', 'complicated/clever', 'was', 'entertaining', 'overtones', 'political', 'conspiracy', 'make', 'realize', 'how', 'easy', 'truly', 'powerful', 'manipulate', 'events.I', 'thought', 'music', 'action', 'end', 'could', 'be', 'tighten', 'up', 'notch', ""n't"", 'big', 'money-shot', 'explosion', 'anything', 'close', 'movie', 'just', 'plot', 'twist', 'more', 'explosive', 'ride', 'more', 'entertaining', 'character', 'much', 'simpler', 'drug-induced', 'graphic', 'plot', 'see', 'recently', 'released', 'Crank', 'excellent', 'action/adventure', 'Transporter', 'man']",N/A

Mystery agent Val Kilmer is assiged to get her back. Did she run off with her professor or was she kidnapped into a sex slsvery ring into the middle east? Do the kidnappers know who she is is this just a random snatch? As the mystery unreels the plot gets more and more convoluted.I loved the idea of this story but the execution was just not all that good. I never really felt connected with the characters, and there was no real connection between the characters themeselves. The characters interactions and behaviors made little to no sense in many scenes, and the while thing felt just a little out of kilter.It was almost like a few reels of film got damaged during the final editing and they couldn't go back and re-film what was lost so they just filled in the best they could. It was like pieces of the movie were missing.I felt the screenplay could have been really really good, but the composition of the film was just patched together. I guess Mamet is better writer than director or else he was going for a film-noir artsy feeling to the work. It didn't work out.

This nifty little thriller from David Mamet doesn't stop to explain everything to the audience but just takes off and unfolds, filling in the blanks as it zips along.Val Kilmer is restrained and contained, playing an icy specialist in the netherworld of &quot;Special Ops&quot;:the nexus between the military and intelligence, political and pragmatic, public and covert arenas.  It is one of his better performances.This self-described &quot;worker bee&quot; finds himself drawn into a situation that demands he go &quot;off the reservation&quot; to question his orders and those giving them for perhaps the first time in his life.  There are many twists and turns along the way, and Mamet keeps it moving along with his trademark cryptic dialogue and his fascination with the competence and ultimate grace of the &quot;professional&quot;.Noting some of the critical reviews, I would agree that he does not break startling new ground here.  I don't think that was Mamet's intent.  I think he wanted to make a crisp thriller and explore again the world of men and women who, as mentioned before, are skilled and adept in their chosen fields, whatever they might be (thieves or spies or salesmen).

In his films, such as ""The Spanish Prisoner,"" ""Homicide"" and ""Heist,"" everything means something but very little means what it appears, and this complexity, coupled with his dialogue, will understandably drive some people right up the wall.In ""Spartan,"" Val Kilmer plays a mysterious ""spec ops"" agent working with the Secret Service to recover a kidnap victim. The captive is a young woman whose identity and significance only come into focus for the viewer as Kilmer's character follows her trail, using bluffs and beatings to leap from one clue to the next.No attempt has been made to spoon-feed the complicated plot to the viewer; the story has almost no exposition and characters don't get much introduction, but the film moves so fast and so confidently that the viewer doesn't really have time to worry about it. In fact, I motored along with ""Spartan"" for nearly an hour before it suddenly occurred to me that the story itself was completely ridiculous, but by that time I had already been pulled in and didn't mind a bit.Overall, the movie feels like a cinematic crossword puzzle rather than an actual story, but the twists and turns are satisfying. ""Spartan"" also gets a lot of mileage out of Kilmer, who seems to be bucking for a comeback and turns in a strong, plausible performance; fans of DVD extras may also enjoy Kilmer's solo commentary, which is spacey and tongue-in-cheek but which is surprisingly interesting and pretty hilarious to boot.",3,A one-man army tears his way through Mametland,1093910400,"08 31, 2004",2004,1973,"['matter', 'what', 'posters', 'previews', 'promise', 'writer-director', 'David', 'Mamet', 'movies', 'such', 'Spartan', 'look', 'sound', 'anybody', 'else', 'movies.Mamet', 'began', 'career', 'playwright', 'honed', 'peculiar', 'style', 'dialogue', 'intentionally', 'scripting', 'lines', 'full', 'repetition', 'stammers', 'pauses', 'profanity', 'feel', 'natural', 'artificial.He', 'later', 'shifted', 'movies', 'mostly', 'cops', 'con', 'artists', 'gamblers', 'gangsters', 'out', 'one', 'twisty', 'idiosyncratic', 'brainteaser', 'films', 'such', 'Spanish', 'Prisoner', 'Homicide', 'Heist', 'everything', 'something', 'very', 'little', 'what', 'complexity', 'coupled', 'dialogue', 'will', 'understandably', 'drive', 'people', 'right', 'up', 'wall.In', 'Spartan', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'mysterious', 'spec', 'ops', 'agent', 'working', 'Secret', 'Service', 'recover', 'kidnap', 'victim', 'captive', 'young', 'woman', 'identity', 'significance', 'only', 'come', 'focus', 'viewer', 'Kilmer', 'character', 'trail', 'using', 'bluffs', 'beatings', 'leap', 'one', 'clue', 'next.No', 'attempt', 'been', 'made', 'spoon-feed', 'complicated', 'plot', 'viewer', 'story', 'almost', 'exposition', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'introduction', 'film', 'moves', 'so', 'fast', 'so', 'confidently', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'time', 'worry', 'fact', 'motored', 'along', 'Spartan', 'nearly', 'hour', 'suddenly', 'occurred', 'story', 'was', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'time', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'pulled', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'bit.Overall', 'movie', 'feels', 'cinematic', 'crossword', 'puzzle', 'rather', 'actual', 'story', 'twists', 'turns', 'are', 'satisfying', 'Spartan', 'also', 'lot', 'mileage', 'Kilmer', 'who', 'be', 'bucking', 'comeback', 'strong', 'plausible', 'performance', 'fans', 'DVD', 'extras', 'may', 'also', 'enjoy', 'Kilmer', 'solo', 'commentary', 'spacey', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'surprisingly', 'interesting', 'pretty', 'hilarious', 'boot']",N/A

There seemed to be two movies, the first in the U.S. to find a kidnapped girl. This is treated with intensity and action. Then, whoops, the twist and we're off to Dubai to fight kidnapping for prostitution and ruthlessness in high places, and we're again treated to intensity and action. The main guy is played by Val Kilmer as one of these humorless Hollywood heroes for whom there is no obstacle which can't be overcome and whose backstory, as they say, has hidden depths of tragedy and alienation. Mamet insures that we see the guy's back without his shirt on and it's not a pretty sight. We learn nefarious things are going on with the big man's staff (the big man is, I assume, the President and the girl's father; she's been kidnapped) and then all of a sudden William Macy takes center stage for the last ten minutes with almost no preparation. //Spoiler alert// Our hero, of course, is a loner -- which is a sure tip-off that anyone he sort of becomes close to is going to get killed.

This is not to say that he's not good, & better than typical playwrights & filmmakers, just that he's not nearly as good as others think he is. Spartan is a good example of typical Mamet- better than your typical thriller, yet still missing something.The film stars the up & down Val Kilmer as a man named Scott- 1 of the peripatetic Men In Black sorts who freelance dangerous work for assorted government agencies. The thrust of the film is the mother of all urban legends- that many pretty, white (especially blond) young women, are kidnapped off the streets & sold into white slavery overseas. While, on occasions, there have been cases of this, they occur once per decade. More usually American girls who hook overseas do so by choice because the country they practice in has legalized prostitution. This film, however, ties white slavery in with the current anti-Moslem paranoia. I'm as anti-Moslem as the next American (as well anti-all religions), but the plot of the film is absurd. The daughter, Laura Newton (Kristin Bell), of a powerful political figure (of unknown rank) has been kidnapped. Scott goes through a series of seemingly related, but mostly red herring, adventures that sees 2 of his sometime partners killed, Curtis (Derek Luke), & sexy Jackie Black (Tia Texada). The daughter's disappearance can only be covered up so long before the media will have at it, yet it may be the politician wanted his daughter to be kidnapped.

I am not sure why it didn't do well because I enjoyed it quite a bit.  Maybe it was when it came out and what it was competing against.  Maybe it was marketed badly.  I don't know, but I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it.Val Kilmer does a great job as Scott or whatever the hero's name really is.  Scott is a nameless man of action who works for the government in some undefined role doing things that can't legally be done, but need to get done.  In this story it is to get back the daughter of the President - although they never come right out and say it.  The girl's kidnappers may or may not know who she really is, but if it hits the papers it is unlikely to end well for her.  Things move fast.Scott also trains new special ops folks and a couple ends up with him in this assignment in various ways.  Derek Luke (from Antwone Fisher) does a fine job as Curtis who is doing his best at whatever Scott wants him to do, but his newness shows.  At times Scott should take him more seriously than he does.  Tia Texada is also fine as the earnest and capable Jackie Black.William H. Macy and Ed O'Neill are government types who will move heaven and earth to support the man they work for (the unstated President).  Their actions and the resources they have at their disposal all add to the behind the curtain suspicions the movie tries to raise in us regarding our government.David Mamet's writing style is unique and personal to him.  I appreciated that the F word quotient is way down here, but there are still more than are really needed for effect.  Some people say that the word adds realism.  Maybe in some circles, but it isn't common where I live and work.The commentary track by Kilmer adds some interesting insights, but wanders a bit too much and seems like a bit of a tossed off assignment rather than wanting to actually share anything much with the viewer, but he does politely thank us for watching the movie at the end.All in all this disk was a pretty good experience and much better than I had anticipated for something that I didn't even know existed.",4,A surprisingly good movie for one I didn't know existed,1092441600,"08 14, 2004",2004,2151,"['movie', 'completely', 'missed', 'when', 'was', 'briefly', 'theaters', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'enjoyed', 'quite', 'bit', 'Maybe', 'was', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'competing', 'Maybe', 'was', 'marketed', 'badly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'it.Val', 'Kilmer', 'great', 'job', 'Scott', 'hero', 'name', 'really', 'Scott', 'nameless', 'man', 'action', 'who', 'government', 'undefined', 'role', 'doing', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'legally', 'be', 'done', 'need', 'get', 'done', 'story', 'get', 'back', 'daughter', 'President', 'never', 'come', 'right', 'say', 'girl', 'kidnappers', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'who', 'really', 'papers', 'unlikely', 'end', 'well', 'Things', 'move', 'fast.Scott', 'also', 'new', 'special', 'ops', 'folks', 'couple', 'up', 'assignment', 'various', 'ways', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'fine', 'job', 'Curtis', 'who', 'doing', 'best', 'Scott', 'do', 'newness', 'shows', 'times', 'Scott', 'should', 'take', 'more', 'seriously', 'Tia', 'Texada', 'also', 'fine', 'earnest', 'capable', 'Jackie', 'Black.William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'are', 'government', 'types', 'who', 'will', 'move', 'heaven', 'earth', 'support', 'man', 'work', 'unstated', 'President', 'actions', 'resources', 'have', 'disposal', 'add', 'curtain', 'movie', 'raise', 'regarding', 'government.David', 'Mamet', 'writing', 'style', 'unique', 'personal', 'appreciated', 'F', 'word', 'quotient', 'way', 'down', 'here', 'are', 'still', 'more', 'are', 'really', 'needed', 'effect', 'people', 'say', 'word', 'realism', 'Maybe', 'circles', ""n't"", 'common', 'where', 'live', 'work.The', 'commentary', 'track', 'Kilmer', 'interesting', 'insights', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'bit', 'tossed', 'off', 'assignment', 'rather', 'wanting', 'actually', 'share', 'anything', 'much', 'viewer', 'politely', 'thank', 'watching', 'movie', 'end.All', 'disk', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'experience', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'anticipated', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'existed']",N/A

At the heart of this film is a mystery, one that the central character must solve and, in doing so, discover something about himself.When the daughter (Bell) of the President of the United States goes missing, the Secret Service brings in Robert Scott (Kilmer) to investigate. He is one of those shadowy operatives with no name (of consequence) that does all of the government?s dirty business under the veil of secrecy and plausible deniability. He is assigned a young, inexperienced partner named Curtis (Luke). They have very little time before the media gets wind of what has happened. The two men go undercover and trace the young girl?s whereabouts to an international prostitution ring.Scott is a typical Mamet protagonist in that he wastes few words and everything he says has meaning. Val Kilmer is a perfect fit for Mamet?s tough, no-nonsense world. He does a good job with Mamet?s tricky, distinctive dialogue. Much like Gene Hackman?s character in Heist, Kilmer?s Scott is efficient and ruthless in his methods because time is of the essence and his way gets results.On paper, the film?s story is a conventional one?it belongs to the action-thriller genres?but Mamet flips all of the clich?s and stereotypes on their head with his unconventional dialogue and characterization. Every bit of dialogue and every action are important. This requires the utmost level of attention from the audience because if you miss something, the film does not slow down and allow you to catch up.Mamet is a breath of fresh air in this politically correct climate in that he never sentimentalizes his characters or their situations. Spartan remains true to this attitude right down the line to its satisfying conclusion.There is a delightfully eccentric audio commentary by actor Val Kilmer. For every interesting factoid (he talks about all the training and preparation he did for the role), he drops surreal observations such as this, ?If you?re listening to this and watching the film for the first time?You?re really strange.? Imagine hearing that in Kilmer?s trademark cadences and you get an idea of what a surprising treat it is listening to this track. While, there are quite a few lulls in the actor?s commentary, there are enough bizarro gems from him to make it worth sitting through the dry spots.The attitude of Kilmer?s character in Spartan reflects that of the movie itself?all business. Mamet?s film is a sleek, professional political thriller that was unfairly ignored by audiences and snubbed by many critics. Perhaps it was his not so thinly-veiled critique of the Presidency or the highly stylized prose that scared off mainstream audiences.

However, when you have Pulitzer Prize winner David Mamet at the helm writing and directing, you can be assured of witty one liners and repartes that you can only find in plays.Val Kilmer, in his meatiest and macho role, boosted with an equally macho script, plays a Special Forces specialist in charge of training Army Rangers. His skills were called upon to track a missing girl of utmost importance yet of a ""hush-hush"" confidential level.I wouldn't give away any spoilers as Mamet gives plenty of twists and turns that screws and eschews any conventional thriller cliches.

822075,A63K426WZXU0D,B00022XE6S,David,"[1, 5]","Director David Mamet has created a little gem of a movie. It is not flashy, it does not rely on towering effects or an outrageous amount of violence to get its point across. Instead, Spartan is a thriller that allows the viewer to utilize his or her mind in order to make the connections between the movies shadowy and alluring plot points. Many mysteries come up all throughout the movie, and it takes quite the amateur detective to figure them out. Luckily, the mystique of the movie is a great aid to the entertainment value, as one is quickly drawn into the gloomy and gritty cutthroat world that Spartan takes place in.Val Kilmer, who delivers a riveting performance as a coldly mechanical Special Forces officer, is part of a super secret covert operations force known as ""The Cadre"". Kilmer is removed from his job as a training officer to undertake a highly sensitive operation. The President's daughter, a glamourous college student, has been kidnaped, and the race is on to find her before it hits the press. Kilmer is a man used to getting results, so he begins a violent rampage through the criminal network that seems to have taken the girl hostage. Through any means necessary, Kilmer soon discovers a fiendish sex slavery ring that procures young girls for overseas clients. Just as Kilmer is about to close the deal and rescue the first daughter, dark political forces way over his head step in. Kilmer realizes that some, for their own unknown motives, would prefer the first daughter stay lost, forcing him to make a difficult decision. He is just a gunman, a well trained killing machine, dynamic thought has not be allowed to him. Should he follow orders he knows are morally wrong, or go renegade and investigate for himself? Kilmer, a man of honor, makes a decision that will effect the lives of many, especially his own. He is the singular Spartan, sent to settle a military problem by himself.The atmosphere of Spartan is the most potent aspect of the movie. It is constantly dark and shadowy, a world besmirched by brutal villains and nefarious political operatives. The shroud is only broken by the figure of Kilmer, who is a monotone but intriguing force of righteous nature, as he tears through this world of lies with a 9mm pistol and a sharp brain. The plot is well paced, slowly revealing strands of truth at appropriate points. I felt the supporting cast was a little sparse in their effect, as the normally wonderful William H. Macy is relegated to a very small part. Also, the ending, which was effectively disturbing, also struck me as ridiculous in a sense, but that is up to you to decide. Numerous cliches and unconvincing coincidences pop up, but they do not take away from the overall quality of the film.

Instead of focusing on powerful explosions and screaming background 'music' and visual tricks, David Mamet, who wrote and directed this tense expose' of the government and its brutal intelligence tactics, opts for terse dialogue and rapid sequence encounters to lead the viewer down a very twisted, convoluted, but fascinating path.  Val Kilmer is superb as Scott, the ex-military, seemingly amoral Secret Service agent (funny how we use ""SS"" letters in our own way...) assigned the complex job of finding the President's daughter (Kristen Bell).  He is assisted by new recruit Curtis (Derek Luke of 'Antoine Fisher' and 'Pieces of April' fame, finding himself very at ease in this type of role!). The endlessly surprising but highly orchestrated search uncovers rings of white slavery in Dubai and other Arab cities, prostitution rings, pockets of quasi-terrorist gents - the list goes on.  The filming technique is one closely associated with Mamet: scenes are shot from obtuse angles and collaged together to heighten tension (if confusing the viewer a bit too often).

This movie is a good drama movie that is a thriller. It has suspensful moments, shocking moments and puzzling moments. This is one movie that requires the viewer's complete attention. If you don't, you'll be confused probably.This movie is about a kidnapping of a very important girl. Val Kilmer plays a special ops guy who is assigned to help search for her. But, this case is complicated with betrayals and lots more. The movie is compelling and exciting and a fun movie to watch.I see mixed reviews on Amazon but don't understand them at all.

Check this one out as it is a surprisingly good movie that is one of the better ones of the past 5 years.Keep an eye out for William H. Macy who delivers a strong performance in a small role!

Marked by brevity of speech, laconic. Courageous in the face of pain, danger, or adversity.If you like Ronin then Spartan is choc-full of the same kind of cryptic dialogue with double/triple meanings and clever touches. Not surprising really since Spartan is written and directed by David Mamet who worked on the Ronin script.When the President's daughter is kidnapped a strict, no-nonsense Secret-Secret Service agent (Val Kilmer) follows an intriguing trail of clues and dead-ends to find out where she is, who took her and why. Hardly sounds original but Spartan dares to do what very, very few Hollywood movies are willing to try; it assumes its audience actually have brains and can figure things out by themselves.Spartan is the slickest, smoothest and smartest thriller for a good while. Kilmer has his critics and is constantly given a hard time. But here he proves what an actor he can be given the right material. Ed O'Neill also pops up and adds some post-Married With Children credibility to his resume.Like Ronin, the action is stern and serious. There's nothing far-fetched or unbelievable about this. It may lack the epic feel of Ronin but Spartan is by no means a small movie. I strongly recommend this if you are tired of idiotic action movies and need a fix of something with some class.The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound and a commentary by Val Kilmer (should be interesting).",4,An intriguing mystery for people who like to think,1109376000,"02 26, 2005",2005,1504,"['Spartan-Rigorously', 'self-disciplined', 'self-restrained', 'Simple', 'frugal', 'austere', 'Marked', 'brevity', 'speech', 'laconic', 'Courageous', 'face', 'pain', 'danger', 'adversity.If', 'Ronin', 'then', 'Spartan', 'choc-full', 'same', 'kind', 'cryptic', 'dialogue', 'double/triple', 'meanings', 'clever', 'touches', 'Not', 'surprising', 'really', 'Spartan', 'written', 'directed', 'David', 'Mamet', 'who', 'worked', 'Ronin', 'script.When', 'President', 'daughter', 'kidnapped', 'strict', 'no-nonsense', 'Secret-Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'intriguing', 'trail', 'clues', 'dead-ends', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'who', 'took', 'why', 'Hardly', 'original', 'Spartan', 'dares', 'do', 'what', 'very', 'very', 'few', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'are', 'willing', 'try', 'audience', 'actually', 'have', 'brains', 'can', 'figure', 'things', 'out', 'themselves.Spartan', 'slickest', 'smoothest', 'smartest', 'thriller', 'good', 'while', 'Kilmer', 'critics', 'constantly', 'given', 'hard', 'time', 'here', 'what', 'actor', 'can', 'be', 'given', 'right', 'material', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'also', 'up', 'post-Married', 'Children', 'credibility', 'resume.Like', 'Ronin', 'action', 'stern', 'serious', 'nothing', 'far-fetched', 'unbelievable', 'may', 'lack', 'epic', 'feel', 'Ronin', 'Spartan', 'means', 'small', 'movie', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'are', 'tired', 'idiotic', 'action', 'movies', 'need', 'fix', 'something', 'class.The', 'DVD', '2.35:1', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'sound', 'commentary', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'should', 'be', 'interesting']",N/A

822091,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B00022XE6S,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[5, 7]","David Mamet is a  master of smoke and mirrors. He has demonstrated this time and time again through both his plays and films. In his films, he has demonstrated an uncanny ability to create a world where nothing is as it seems. Your friends are your enemies, your lovers are your killers, and vice versa. He also has a knack for dialogue, whichi is kind of like saying Michelangelo had a knack for ceiling painting. In &quot;Spartan&quot;, he displays a heretofore-unseen ability to make a very visual as well as a very well-written film. His other films, like &quot;House of Games&quot;, &quot;Heist&quot;, and &quot;Homicide&quot;, while being good (&quot;Heist&quot;) to great (&quot;House of Games&quot;, &quot;Homicide&quot;) have never displayed a strong visual language. But here he combines the best of all the film worlds with great acting, writing and directing. Kilmer, who almost always does brilliant work, does it again here with the portrayal of Scott, an extraordinary black ops agent for the US government who is brought in to assist in the safe retrieval of the kidnapped daughter of a politician who rates VERY HIGH on the food chain. -SPOILERS AHEAD- Scott is a singularly driven man who will do whatever he needs to to get the job done. In one shocking instance, he must kill a police officer and another man in order to gain the confidence of someone who may know where the girl is. He threatens to gouge out eyes, but with Scott, you know it's not just a threat. Sometimes he must mistreat the very people he's trying to protect in order to get the job done right. Of course, you have to remember this IS a David Mamet film, and the first rule of his films is that NOTHING IS AS IT SEEMS. Even Scott, who as ruthless and task-oriented as he is, becomes a morally-challenged man when he is left out to dry by the people he serves. This film is a great companion piece to John Frankenheimer's &quot;Ronin&quot;, who Mamet co-wrote under a psudeonym, but if you watch &quot;Ronin&quot; again, you can hear and feel Mamet's influence, particularly in the dialogue. Anyway, both of these films are about the world of the covert operation, whether it's for a government or a pack of mercenaries, and neither of them have those spy-movie moments where the colloquialisms and slang of black-bag ops are not explained by a character to another character just so the audience knows what it means.

822092,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B00022XE6S,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[2, 3]","When Laura Newton (Kristen Bell), the daughter of a high ranking government official and a student at Harvard, goes missing Bobby Scott's (Val Kilmer) services are enlisted in Boston to help find the missing girl. Joined by a former recruit fresh out of training named Curtis (Derek Luke), Scott investigates the disappearance, but as he goes further down the rabbit hole looking for Laura he learns that there may be more to the disappearance than initially expected.There are very few writers who know their way around a line of dialogue quite like David Mamet. As a playwright he received the Pulitzer for his brilliant play Glengarry Glen Ross (which he later adapted for the screen), and as a screenwriter he's been nominated for Oscars for both Wag the Dog and The Verdict. But you won't have to look very far to see movies based on his work from The Untouchables to Hannibal and back to The Postman Always Rings Twice, not to mention he created the TV show The Unit. For his tenth feature film as a director, Mamet decided to create a film inspired in part by Eric L. Haney, one of the founding members of the elite Delta Force, who also served as one the technical advisers on the film.One of David Mamet's greatest abilities as a writer is to take a screenplay and a film that could easily become cliche, and turn it on it's ear and make it fresh. With Spartan, he takes a film that in a lesser filmmakers hands would have been over the top and grounds it in reality through dialogue and giving the plot situations that don't seem too far off from real life. Often, we don't think of men in situations like Bobby Scott's in Spartan as being something that could be real, but Mamet treats it like this is something that could, and does happen, and makes the audience believe it.But there's only so much one man can do when working with a cast of actors, and it's really the job of the actors to sell us the characters, and each actor truly sells it. Val Kilmer, who I personally think is very underrated, is Bobby Scott. When you watch him on the screen in this movie, you have no doubt that this man will recover Laura Newton, you know he has the training and the experience to get it done. The performance that really caught me by surprise though was Kristen Bell as the aforementioned Laura. If all you know her from is Forgetting Sarah Marshall, she will completely surprise you here.Spartan is a movie that's almost perfect, where it nearly falls apart is in one of the final scenes of the movie. It's understandable that Mamet had to throw in one last confrontation in, but unfortunately what he does throw in doesn't feel completely organic. I don't want to give anything away, mostly due to the fact that I'm not one to spoil things for everyone, but also because you might not feel the same way I do concerning this ending.Overall, I highly recommend this movie. While not completely based on a true story, there are elements that have basis in real experiences, and we often don't realize the covert operations that are taken on in an effort to keep us from worrying about some of the darker things that happen throughout the world around us. Mamet did an amazing job of conveying that real world sentiment to film while also making a highly entertaining film.4.5/5",4,Spartan,1275696000,"06 5, 2010",2010,3283,"['When', 'Laura', 'Newton', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'daughter', 'high', 'ranking', 'government', 'official', 'student', 'Harvard', 'missing', 'Bobby', 'Scott', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'services', 'are', 'enlisted', 'Boston', 'help', 'find', 'missing', 'girl', 'Joined', 'former', 'recruit', 'training', 'named', 'Curtis', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'Scott', 'disappearance', 'further', 'down', 'rabbit', 'hole', 'looking', 'Laura', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'disappearance', 'initially', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'writers', 'who', 'know', 'way', 'line', 'dialogue', 'quite', 'David', 'Mamet', 'playwright', 'received', 'Pulitzer', 'brilliant', 'play', 'Glengarry', 'Glen', 'Ross', 'later', 'adapted', 'screen', 'screenwriter', 'been', 'nominated', 'Oscars', 'Wag', 'Dog', 'Verdict', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'look', 'very', 'far', 'see', 'movies', 'based', 'work', 'Untouchables', 'Hannibal', 'back', 'Postman', 'Always', 'Rings', 'Twice', 'not', 'mention', 'created', 'TV', 'show', 'Unit', 'tenth', 'feature', 'film', 'director', 'Mamet', 'decided', 'create', 'film', 'inspired', 'part', 'Eric', 'L.', 'Haney', 'one', 'founding', 'members', 'elite', 'Delta', 'Force', 'who', 'also', 'served', 'one', 'technical', 'advisers', 'film.One', 'David', 'Mamet', 'greatest', 'abilities', 'writer', 'take', 'screenplay', 'film', 'could', 'easily', 'become', 'cliche', 'turn', 'ear', 'make', 'fresh', 'Spartan', 'film', 'lesser', 'filmmakers', 'hands', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'top', 'reality', 'dialogue', 'giving', 'plot', 'situations', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'too', 'far', 'real', 'life', 'Often', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'men', 'situations', 'Bobby', 'Scott', 'Spartan', 'being', 'something', 'could', 'be', 'real', 'Mamet', 'something', 'could', 'happen', 'audience', 'believe', 'it.But', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'man', 'can', 'do', 'when', 'working', 'cast', 'actors', 'really', 'job', 'actors', 'sell', 'characters', 'actor', 'truly', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'who', 'personally', 'think', 'very', 'underrated', 'Bobby', 'Scott', 'When', 'watch', 'screen', 'movie', 'have', 'doubt', 'man', 'will', 'recover', 'Laura', 'Newton', 'know', 'training', 'experience', 'get', 'done', 'performance', 'really', 'caught', 'surprise', 'though', 'was', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'aforementioned', 'Laura', 'know', 'Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'will', 'completely', 'surprise', 'movie', 'almost', 'perfect', 'where', 'nearly', 'apart', 'one', 'final', 'scenes', 'movie', 'understandable', 'Mamet', 'had', 'throw', 'one', 'last', 'confrontation', 'unfortunately', 'what', 'throw', ""n't"", 'feel', 'completely', 'organic', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'mostly', 'due', 'fact', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'spoil', 'things', 'everyone', 'also', 'might', 'not', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'do', 'concerning', 'ending.Overall', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'not', 'completely', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'are', 'elements', 'have', 'basis', 'real', 'experiences', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'covert', 'operations', 'are', 'taken', 'effort', 'keep', 'worrying', 'darker', 'things', 'happen', 'world', 'Mamet', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'conveying', 'real', 'world', 'sentiment', 'film', 'also', 'making', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'film.4.5/5']",N/A

Joe Mantegna-not a particularily gifted actor to begin with-is an exceptionally good example in both Homicide and House of Games.  Certainly Spartan is one of Val Kilmer's worst performances, and this from a man who deserved a best supporting for Tombstone.  The exception to the rule is Glengarry, Glen Ross, the only successful Mamet movie I can think of, and the only one in which the performers were not diluted by exposure to his directing and dialogue-dialogue that is overly celebrated as it is so often artificial, overly intellectualized, and forced.  The second thing I was reminded about Mamet is that his plotting quite often is cheap.  He uses quick fix devices to drive the story along.Examples in Spartan include the symbol that the Kilmer character just happens to notice on a letter and that later this girl who seemingly wants away from everyone anyway keeps marking on the steam or dirt of windows that by wonderful coincidence will be looked through by main characters.After State and Main-a completely derivative comedy on filmmaking (see Sweet Liberty, which is much better), I promised myself no more Mamet.

While this movie isn't his absolutely top-drawer material (_House of Games_, _Spanish Prisoner_), it's still way better than the usual run of 'political thrillers'.If you know who Mamet is, you already know that his dialogue is lean, focused, and idiosyncratic to the point of surreality. You also know to expect a plot consisting of one mind-bending twist after another. This movie will meet your expectations.It probably won't exceed them; as political films go, this isn't quite up to _Wag the Dog_ (another of Mamet's best screenplays). Its plot is actually -- for Mamet -- pretty straightforward: Laura Newton, the president's daughter, has disappeared, and super-duper Black Ops guy 'Scott' (Val Kilmer) is going to get her back.By the time we're through we've been cycled through quite a bit of ruthlessness, cynicism, and unflattering revelations about political ambition. The direction is extraordinarily good -- and, for what it's worth, the deaths (of which there are many) are eerily realistic, not yer usual Hollywood screaming-bullets-and-exploding-cars BS. The ensemble cast is wonderful (particularly Kilmer).But we don't really visit any new territory. For my taste there are a few too many cliches here -- which would be somewhat more acceptable if they were at least Mamet's _own_ cliches, but some of these are Tom Clancy's.Nonetheless it's all handled deftly and intelligently, and it's miles above the usual run of political thrillers.

Hollywood got this one wrong.Val Kilmer plays Scott, a Secret Service operative assigned to do the dirty tasks that would otherwise not be countenanced by squeamish bleeding hearts. For instance, in order to get crucial information from a suspect, Scott is not above breaking the scumbag's arm. In the defense of Mom, flag and apple pie, a Hard Man is good to find.In SPARTAN, a VIP's daughter, Laura (Kristen Bell), is kidnapped from her college dorm after her Secret Service protection is temporarily withdrawn to supplement that of Ol' Dad's when he comes to town to visit his mistress during a re-election campaign. The script never specifically says so, but the viewer presumes we're talking about the President here. In any case, the girl is apparently destined to be sent to a country bordering the Arabian Gulf where she'll become the sex slave of a rich sheikh. At this point in the plot, the kidnappers don't know whom they've got, and Scott must retrieve Laura before the story breaks in the press.Mind you, Kilmer gives a taut performance as the Service's Rambo. And the supporting cast includes the ever-watchable William H. Macy as the VIP's political Machiavelli, and Ed O'Neill as the agent in charge of the rescue. (I can never see O'Neill without hearing MARRIED WITH CHILDREN's Peggy whine ""Aaaa-lll!"") However, when the audience finally meets Laura, she turns out to be such an unappealing brat that the viewer perhaps wonders why all the bother. Finally, Laura's deliverance from the Middle East is by such a successful, albeit fortuitously unexpected, route, that one questions why Scott didn't plan something similar - such as marching into the local BBC office with the girl in tow - from the very beginning instead of trying to be cute about it.The title ""Spartan"" makes reference to the proud habit of the ancient Greek city-state of Sparta, when asked by a neighboring city to send military aid, of sending just one of its super warriors to get the job done.",3,Anticlimactic,1091923200,"08 8, 2004",2004,2054,"['second', 'half', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'better', 'first', 'Hollywood', 'got', 'one', 'wrong.Val', 'Kilmer', 'Scott', 'Secret', 'Service', 'operative', 'assigned', 'do', 'dirty', 'tasks', 'would', 'otherwise', 'not', 'be', 'countenanced', 'squeamish', 'bleeding', 'hearts', 'instance', 'order', 'get', 'crucial', 'information', 'suspect', 'Scott', 'not', 'breaking', 'scumbag', 'arm', 'defense', 'Mom', 'flag', 'apple', 'pie', 'Hard', 'Man', 'good', 'find.In', 'SPARTAN', 'VIP', 'daughter', 'Laura', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'kidnapped', 'college', 'dorm', 'Secret', 'Service', 'protection', 'temporarily', 'withdrawn', 'supplement', 'Ol', 'Dad', 'when', 'town', 'visit', 'mistress', 're-election', 'campaign', 'script', 'never', 'specifically', 'so', 'viewer', ""'re"", 'talking', 'President', 'here', 'case', 'girl', 'apparently', 'destined', 'be', 'sent', 'country', 'bordering', 'Arabian', 'Gulf', 'where', ""'ll"", 'become', 'sex', 'slave', 'rich', 'sheikh', 'point', 'plot', 'kidnappers', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'whom', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Scott', 'must', 'retrieve', 'Laura', 'story', 'breaks', 'press.Mind', 'Kilmer', 'taut', 'performance', 'Service', 'Rambo', 'supporting', 'cast', 'ever-watchable', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'VIP', 'political', 'Machiavelli', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'agent', 'charge', 'rescue', 'can', 'never', 'see', ""O'Neill"", 'hearing', 'MARRIED', 'WITH', 'CHILDREN', 'Peggy', 'whine', 'Aaaa-lll', 'However', 'when', 'audience', 'finally', 'Laura', 'out', 'be', 'such', 'unappealing', 'brat', 'viewer', 'perhaps', 'wonders', 'why', 'bother', 'Finally', 'Laura', 'deliverance', 'Middle', 'East', 'such', 'successful', 'albeit', 'fortuitously', 'unexpected', 'route', 'one', 'questions', 'why', 'Scott', 'did', ""n't"", 'plan', 'something', 'similar', 'such', 'marching', 'local', 'BBC', 'office', 'girl', 'tow', 'very', 'beginning', 'instead', 'trying', 'be', 'cute', 'it.The', 'title', 'Spartan', 'reference', 'proud', 'habit', 'ancient', 'Greek', 'city-state', 'Sparta', 'when', 'asked', 'neighboring', 'city', 'send', 'military', 'aid', 'sending', 'just', 'one', 'super', 'warriors', 'get', 'job', 'done']",N/A

Mamet completely avoids cliches and predictability by keeping the plot constantly moving and challenging. Bring your thinking caps for this one. This is a story that's mostly plot and little else, but there's nothing wrong with that as long as you have rapid pacing. Yes, things get complicated and get there fast.I don't want to go too much into the plot for fear of giving away plot twists. Basically, Val Kilmer plays a tough-as-nails secret service agent who gets involved in the case of the kidnapping of the president's daughter. That's all I will say. To really experience this film, it's best to go in cold, and while plot twists flood the script, they always seem logical as things unfold.It's also worth noting this isn't a generic action film. In fact there's not much ""action,"" in the normal sense of the word. But something is always happening, and once Mamet charges this ticking clock pulse-pounder, there's no turning back.Mamet also doesn't waste time with trite character arcs and back stories. He soley focuses on the plot and the suspense and thrills. The characters seem almost as if they already know themselves and know their role in the events that unfold. But Mamet keeps them interesting by tossing in small details about them throughout the film.All in all, this is a great thriller that deserves more accolades than it got.

Scott is known to them as a methodical problem solver who always solves his problems.  This is essential as Scott is being called upon to recover a missing person who appears to have been kidnapped.  The missing person's identity is never fully revealed as they only refer to her as ""the girl"", but it is obvious that she is an important person as the CIA is willing to recover her at any cost.The Spartan is a journey into a world where decisions are made under gun point and a wrong decision could get one killed.

822105,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00022XE6S,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 9]","I wish I had known that &quot;Spartan&quot; was written and directed by David Mamet before I started watching it because then I would have warmed up to the movie a lot more quickly.  Doing so was a problem for me because this film pushed a couple of my buttons.  First, it involves the kidnapping of the president's daughter.  My complain is not that this has been happening a lot (e.g., &quot;The West Wing&quot;), but that doing these stories at a time when the sitting president has daughters and there are ample reasons for terrorists to make them targets might be tempting fate too much.  Second, it also touches on the idea of Secret Service incompetence and culpability in political shenanigans.  I get the feeling that the Secret Service in most Hollywood movies has replaced what would have been psychotic Vietnam vets a generation ago (and sadistic Nazis the generation before that).  I just tend to find such portrayals rather insulting to those people whose job is to throw themselves in front of bullets.But even given the hole that &quot;Spartan&quot; started out with in my eyes this is quite a compelling film.  With Mamet things are never simple and the chief attraction here is how the film's hero, an agent named Scott (Val Kilmer), tries to catch up with the events that are unraveling at warp speed involving the president's daughter (Kristen Bell), and unraveling is most decidedly the operative word in this story.  I probably should have started counting the conventions of this genre that Mamet is playing with in &quot;Spartan,&quot; especially with regards to the supporting roles of Curtis (Derek Luke), Jackie Black (Tia Texada), and Stoddard (William H. Macy), who come and go in the most interesting ways.  Scott is an interesting character because he is almost a sanctioned loose cannon, who will put on his thinking cap and do whatever it takes to get the job done (even if it means doing whatever it takes to get the job done).Of course as much fun as a David Mamet plot is there is also the distinctive dialogue that he gives his characters to speak.  If you are hoping for lots of exposition to explain what is going on, then you are in the wrong movie.  Add to that the fact that just because somebody says something does not mean they mean it.

822107,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B00022XE6S,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[1, 1]","I think probably the best way to approach this film is to view it as a parable. Several other folks here have pointed out the high degree of non-credible plot points/twists, and that's definitely the case. However, if your take on this, rather than as a completely realistic cinematic story, is instead to see it as symbolic of the American way of life in the context of political/global machinations, I think it works really well.Assuming the politics reflected in the movie are close to if not coinciding with Mamet's own, the writer/director reveals himself to be a supreme cynic. Sex is the driving element that forces that hand, but interestingly enough, there's no sex in the film at all--at least nothing overtly shown on screen. Sex for Mamet is a behind-closed-doors activity all the way, and it's something that drives the actions of three characters in the film--one never seen, one minor character, and one who is the reason for the entire story of the movie itself.The kidnapping of the U.S. president's daughter is what sets the story in motion, and what drives Robert Scott (Val Kilmer in a spot-on performance) to do all the stuff he does in the film to get her back. Along the way, we find extremely hard-nosed cynical politicos (Ed O'Neill in a startlingly good performance, as well as William Macy), soldiers, Secret Service agents who appear as something else entirely, and criminals as well--that is, criminals shown to be criminals (they wear prison outfits). But Mamet's ultra-cynical perspective is that basically everybody is a criminal. It's just that different people express their criminality differently.There's no love story here. None. This is a tough, rock solid, machine of a political thriller that pounds it out with a boatload of sharp dialogue, as you would expect from Mamet. It's a really interesting departure from his other films--somewhat anticipated by The Spanish Prisoner, yes, but totally different from that film.Overlook the non-credible plot points, sit back, and enjoy the ride.

Mamet delves into the world of secret service and black ops agents who are trained to take on missions without question and with total dedication. The president's daughter has been kidnapped and the CIA/secret service strain to get her back before anyone misses her. Just how this is accomplished is full of twists & unexpected turns supplied by characters who work in the shadows, out of view and often unaccountable for their tactics.Classic Mamet dialogue gives you such memorable lines as--CIA Director: ""Where's the girl?""Agent: ""Sir, we think...""CIA Director:""Yes, go on."" ""Agent: ""Sir, we think the girl's been kidnapped and, and...delivered to a bordello. They don't know who they have. They think she's just some girl.""CIA Director: ""Some girl? They think she's just some girl? (Beat) What'll they do when her hair grows out? When they see that red hair?""Kilmer: ""They'll kill her.""CIA Director: (Beat) ""Right.""Now that's writing and it brilliantly works. Mamet knows how to create characters through terse dialogue and when to leave it to action. Val Kilmer is so effin terrific in his role as an agent who, against his better judgement, puts on his ""thinking cap"" and goes ""off the reservation"" to get the girl.  Watching this makes me miss his presence on the screen. Great scenes throughout this film.

822113,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00022XE6S,Mark Turner,"[1, 3]","I have long been a fan of the films of David Mamet, except perhaps the one he is most noted for, GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS. While that film explored a number of ideas and concerns, focusing on the lives of its characters, I just could never get involved in it properly. Rather, I found his film HOUSE OF GAMES to be one of the most surprising films I had seen in years, holding my in it's grip until the end.That being said, Mamet's film SPARTAN offers no major surprises and many have claimed that it is clich&eacute; ridden, riding on the backs of spy films past and present. I found this not to be true. While some scenarios might seem that way, the whole plot beneath what is really going on for one, I found that movie fresh and interesting, in no minor part due to the work of Val Kilmer.Kilmer plays Scott, a career special forces Ranger who has worked covert ops and is now helping in training a new set of recruits. On his way home after completing this mission, he is called in to help with a delicate situation. It seems that the President's daughter Laura (Kristin Bell) has been kidnapped due to the bumbling of her Secret Service protection. Scott is one of those do anything no matter what kind of action heroes. He does not feel compromised when torturing a suspect nor taking out anyone deemed necessary by his commanders.Bringing in the latest recruit Curtis (Derek Luke) to help him, Scott sets out to find just who is responsible. The trail leads him to a group of foreigners who are part of a group trafficking human beings. The pair raid a house where Curtis sees the sign that Laura draws to sign her name. A situation arises where the suspects draw weapons and are killed before they can offer any information.Several leads direct Scott and Curtis to a Middle Eastern country where the traffickers are based. A Special Forces team is about to raid the location she has been taken to. As they are about to go in, the call comes for them to hold off as the girl's body has apparently been washed ashore back home.This leaves one problem. Curtis tracks down Scott and tells him he saw the sign. He knows that the girl WAS in that location. So who was the body that washed ashore and where is the REAL Laura?As the pair investigate, shots are fired and Scott finds himself on the outside, running for his life and the life of the President's daughter. Calling in old favors, he relocates to the house where the raid was to take place to rescue Laura. But there is more at stake than the life of this girl. A conspiracy to leave her behind is in play and no one save Scott seems to want her found. Can he save her and his own hide in the process?Toss in the fact that those trying to get Scott are in the employ of the President and you have an odd situation. It seems that those Secret Service men who were responsible for watching Laura were taken off that detail to watch out for the President who was visiting his mistress at the time. Being an election year, there is no way that they can allow any of this to become know.The action scenes are played well, complimented by the fact that there is some heavy duty acting going on in their set ups. Kilmer is fantastic as the cold killer who begins to have pieces of his armor chipped away showing the real man beneath. And Mamet, known for his dialogues, backs off of the over the top wordage in favor of a more direct approach to the conversations among these characters.The film looks clean, well cut and tells a story that absorbs the viewer from beginning to end. Some may not have been particularly fond of this film, but my guess is they were expecting the same old Mamet.

Kilmer is a man of honor, but weary serving as a spartan for immoral and corrupt politicians.  He finishes what he thinks was a simple seedy mission, and moves on with his ""normal"" life planting his garden and eking out a lonely life between missions. But a young impressionable recruit wakes Kilmer from his nihilistic stupor, and he understands his next mission is his most important. To save his soul, and find redemption. The dialog is like a complex crossword puzzle of double innuendoes of double meaning and philosophical lessons of life.

822117,A3K8TYU7UOUTR0,B00022XE6S,M. Dog,"[3, 6]","One would not have to see the credits to know that this is a David Mamet movie. After one or two rhythmic, staccato exchanges of dialogue, Mamet's script writing fingerprints all but glow of the screen. When Mamet has his mojo working, his dialogue is lean and concise as haiku written in cool code (Glengarry Glen Ross, Things Change), but beware when he misses (Heist). Then it's like listening to a rejected radio play from the thirties. I was happy that he hit the mark with Spartan. There are only one are two times when his dialogue bordered on macho-embarrassing, but the movie has such tremendous forward momentum that it become part of the fun.Briefly, the film tells the tale of a secret agent (Val Kilmer) from one of those Government organizations that have no name (do they really exist or was it just too convenient a construct for Hollywood not to invent?). The agent, who is called Scott, must retrieve the president's missing daughter. Of course, all is not what it seems.Several things make this DVD worthy of purchase and re-watching:First, as I have said, the movie has tremendous speed. I found myself not being bored for a single second. Every frame of film time has value, and the action scenes are expertly done and believable. It seems to have been Mamet's goal in this movie to really hammer down the film's editing and dialogue to the naked essentials. The men (and one woman) move in this film with a horrible efficiency toward a single goal. In Val Kilmer's commentary track in the special features, he said the characters reminded him of &quot;hunting dogs,&quot; and that is a perfect analogy. Kilmer's character and his co-workers move like a one-minded pack scenting blood.Also, the film is beautiful to look at. The camera work is very creative and manages to convey a tight, claustrophobic world of tremendous pressure. Shadows loom and stretch across the ground, up the sides of buildings, across faces. The palate is one of hard blue steel and shiny black where rich, primary colors are often reflected on polished surfaces. Everything, including the faces, captures the light of chrome.Lastly, the performances:I will say up front I am a Val Kilmer fan (it is a great shame that Kilmer's current reputation in Hollywood seems to require that one admit that &quot;up front&quot;). For whatever reason, he seems to have been struggling a bit lately. Hollywood gossip has it that he is nearly impossible to work with, and that the big boys are calling him less just to avoid his ego. Whatever. I find him watchable in nearly everything he's ever done. He has an odd poise as an actor - the ability to take his time with a line or a character, never rushing or histrionic. He has a certain control that really conveys confidence without the need for extravagance. I find this quality very unique today (is anybody else getting tired of Sean Penn, as gifted as he is, blubbering and flailing through every role?)As a special treat, the much underused Ed O'Neil makes an appearance as &quot;Burch,&quot; clearly the leader of these nameless men of a nameless organization. Watch O'Neil's eyes during his first scenes.

It stars Val Kilmer as a elite secret agent with paramilitary training who does dirty work for various U.S. Government agencies. He goes by the name of Mr. Scott, but we're led to believe that's not his real name. When the President's daughter disappears from her college campus, apparently kidnapped, Mr. Scott is assigned to assist the Secret Service in finding her. They have only two days to find and retrieve Laura Newton (Kristen Bell) before the news media get ahold of the story. Scott tracks her down. A rescue mission is planned. But things aren't as they appear.&quot;Spartan&quot; is not an adrenaline-pumping thriller. It's more of a puzzle. It's filmed in a shadowy, brooding style. A surprising number of scenes take place at night. &quot;Spartan&quot; presents an extremely cynical view of politics and power, which might be interesting if the story made any sense. Not only does the story not make sense, the dialogue doesn't either. It's conspicuously unnatural and consistently nonsensical. I think Val Kilmer's timing is poor in a few places, but it's hard to tell, because the lines are cringe-inducing anyway. Derek Luke and Tia Texada give the most memorable performances as young rookie agents Curtis and Black. I'm giving &quot;Spartan&quot; three stars for the cinematography by Juan Ruiz Anchia. I like the way this film looks. But the writing is just plain bad.The DVD: Bonus features include an audio commentary by Val Kilmer and a theatrical trailer. Don't watch the trailer before the movie. It's full of spoilers. The audio commentary is interesting in spots but a little frustrating because it meanders and contains a lot of long pauses. Kilmer also frequently doesn't comment on the scene that he's looking at. It's very stream-of-consciousness.

Written and directed by the acclaimed David Mamet, it is Kilmer's best role since his work in 'Heat.' The plot involves a high ranking government official whose college age daughter goes missing. There is some suspense as to how and why the Secret Service was not on top of their game when she takes off for fun and then is kidnapped. After she is discovered missing things move fast. And it's here where some of the plot twists reminded me of elements from '24'(and I'm not sure who was copying who?).Kilmer plays a paramilitary type who assists with the fast moving investigation.  The secret service guys refer to him as 'Mr. Scott' but we all know that he is a 'black' op who officially doesn't exist. The good thing about that is he gets to do all kinds of extreme stuff that would get most cops fired or prosecuted.

The difficult thing is he also likes to repeat key phrases and overlay conversations - that is have two precisely timed conversations going on at the same time.  Therefore, pay close attention to what is being said.The president's daughter has been abducted and special ops agent Scott has been assigned to find her before anyone finds out.  He first finds her boyfriend.  The boyfriend tells him that they broke up and she is seeing a professor.  Additionally he finds out that she went to a club where college girls can make a few bucks entertaining businessmen.  This leads to a brothel and a madam who leads them to a white slavery ring.  They discover that the ring is run by an imprisoned Lebanese man.  They run an elaborate sting to find where she is being shipped from.  This runs afoul and they are going to rescue her from slavers camp.  But they receive news that her body was found drowned off the coast with the professor.Curtis, Scott's second, tells him that he does not believe she drowned.  The beach house where she was kept had her short sign,%-), in the window and that when he was cleaning his car he found a fragment of an earring.  She was wearing that earring in a recent photo.  They go back to the beach house and a sniper awaits them.  This means something is very a miss.  Scott finally figures out that if the truth came out, that it could cause the president great embarrassment and so the president decided to cut his losses.  Scott will not let his assignment fail and devises a rescue.Val Kilmer's career has been up and down mostly due to bizarre choices of roles.  This is one of his finest roles.  He is not a Mamet actor but definitely handles Mamet's tricky dialogue with great ease.  Look out for Veronica Mars star Kristen Bell as the president's daughter.As stated above, Mamet is very word oriented.  Sometimes his films get to be very talky and you can easily get lost. Plus this is an action film; words and action don't generally work together.  But this is not the case.  He also directed the film, so I think that he had control of all aspects and when the scenes that involve Mamet talk are on, they are scintillating.  And action sequences are tense.  This is a well made film.DVD EXTRAS: None",5,Mamet Writes and Directs and Val Kilmer Gives a Great Performance,1139702400,"02 12, 2006",2006,2363,"['one', 'thing', 'must', 'understand', 'David', 'Mamet', 'master', 'wordsmith', 'plays', 'films', 'are', 'words', 'said', 'difficult', 'thing', 'also', 'repeat', 'key', 'phrases', 'overlay', 'conversations', 'have', 'two', 'precisely', 'timed', 'conversations', 'going', 'same', 'time', 'Therefore', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'what', 'being', 'said.The', 'president', 'daughter', 'been', 'abducted', 'special', 'ops', 'agent', 'Scott', 'been', 'assigned', 'find', 'anyone', 'out', 'first', 'boyfriend', 'boyfriend', 'broke', 'up', 'seeing', 'professor', 'Additionally', 'out', 'went', 'club', 'where', 'college', 'girls', 'can', 'make', 'few', 'bucks', 'entertaining', 'businessmen', 'brothel', 'madam', 'who', 'white', 'slavery', 'ring', 'discover', 'ring', 'run', 'imprisoned', 'Lebanese', 'man', 'run', 'elaborate', 'sting', 'find', 'where', 'being', 'shipped', 'afoul', 'are', 'going', 'rescue', 'slavers', 'camp', 'receive', 'news', 'body', 'was', 'found', 'drowned', 'coast', 'professor.Curtis', 'Scott', 'second', 'not', 'believe', 'drowned', 'beach', 'house', 'where', 'was', 'kept', 'had', 'short', 'sign', '%', 'window', 'when', 'was', 'cleaning', 'car', 'found', 'fragment', 'earring', 'was', 'wearing', 'earring', 'recent', 'photo', 'go', 'back', 'beach', 'house', 'sniper', 'something', 'very', 'miss', 'Scott', 'finally', 'out', 'truth', 'came', 'out', 'could', 'cause', 'president', 'great', 'embarrassment', 'so', 'president', 'decided', 'cut', 'losses', 'Scott', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'assignment', 'fail', 'rescue.Val', 'Kilmer', 'career', 'been', 'up', 'down', 'mostly', 'due', 'bizarre', 'choices', 'roles', 'one', 'finest', 'roles', 'not', 'Mamet', 'actor', 'definitely', 'Mamet', 'tricky', 'dialogue', 'great', 'ease', 'Look', 'out', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'star', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'president', 'daughter.As', 'stated', 'Mamet', 'very', 'word', 'oriented', 'Sometimes', 'films', 'get', 'be', 'very', 'talky', 'can', 'easily', 'get', 'lost', 'action', 'film', 'words', 'action', 'do', ""n't"", 'generally', 'work', 'together', 'not', 'case', 'also', 'directed', 'film', 'think', 'had', 'control', 'aspects', 'when', 'scenes', 'involve', 'Mamet', 'talk', 'are', 'are', 'scintillating', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'tense', 'well', 'made', 'film.DVD', 'EXTRAS', 'None']",N/A

In fact, do yourself a favour, and find out as little as you can about the plot, you'll enjoy the movie all the more!  Having said that, the loose ends dont quite all tie up, and the ending does not live up to the build up, but this is only a minor quiblle when the acting and script are of this quality.The music is minimal, and the directing is not flashy, but all serves to further the story - a quality so lacking in Hollywood these days.The pace never lets up, and the script of course is sharp and real.

Scott (Val Kilmer) is a marine who doesn't wince at taking out a man's eye for not spilling the beans. As usual David Mamet's direction and screenplay leave the viewer's head spinning after the first three minutes with questions like, ""how come a marine is shooting up the local police force?"" Many tough as nails moments force the viewer to confront these cold case facts of a military underbelly that needs the guts to get the job done at any cost, especially when the President's daughter (implied as the President's daughter but never officially stated by the movie) has been kidnapped by a Middle Eastern prostitution ring that does not know what it has done. Queue various international espionage scenes including some cinematography work in Dubai and mix it with homeland security conspiracy and you have got yourself a drama that plants itself right on in there along side classics like ""Marathon Man"" and ""3 Days of the Condor"" and is not a distant cry from Clancy movies like ""Clear and Present Danger"".As a special ops squad leader, Scott does not plan missions; he executes them, with an iron fist conviction that expects complete obedience from his subordinates. In one scene he takes an old age pensioner madam and places her in a chokehold to get the information out of her. Knowing that the girl will be killed when the abductors figure out what they have, it is a race against the clock. Scott dawns a detective mind that is not afraid to whip out a blade when the going gets tough. A double cross sees Scott eventually planning his own mission in order to do the right thing. There is plenty of thinking, plot twists and characters to make it deeper than most thrillers, with still lots to do. This is ace entertainment through and through. If you like any of the movies mentioned in this review and know who Mamet is and appreciate Kilmer in comeback mode - then what are you waiting for? This could well be one of the best DVDs you could hook up with in 2005. It is certainly the best post 911 thriller that does a good spin on homeland security.

We are given early proof that these are trained killers and, what is sobering is that such people may very well exist in the current xenophobe-paranoid US administration.Despite the confusion and frightful lines, devoid of any humor or humanity whatever, the plot is so flimsy that the general idea emerges quite easily: a political figure, running for office, has his daughter kidnapped for the white-slave trade and his handlers stage her fictitious death to avoid exposing him as an adulterer.Nevertheless, the hero (with whom I could not feel a single milligram of human sympathy); robotically played by Val Kilmer, becomes embroiled with some predictably evil Arabs and travels to Dubai to rescue the sniveling brat.

When we first meet him he is running a training course for the military who hope to weed out weak recruits. Two recruits who pass the test are Curtis (Derek Luke) and Jackie (Tia Texada). Before Scott can leave the base he is picked up by a helicopter and told that they need his help in finding a missing girl. He wonders why someone of his caliber would be called upon for a such an ordinary sounding mission but he learns that the kidnapped girl is actually the President's daughter. The Secret Service are hoping for a swift recovery since elections are looming and if this information gets out it could have a devastating effect. Things get more twisted when Scott learns that the girl may have been kidnapped for a possible prostitution ring operating in Dubai. The kidnappers don't know who they nabbed and picked her based on her blonde hair and  good looks. Scott is forced to go it alone which sends him to Dubai where he is acting for a small group of people  without the support of the U.S. Government. His two recruits Jackie and Curtis play a crucial role in his extracting the girl. Mamet throws a lot of stuff into the mix that can be confusing and overwhelming at times. Especially if you are not familiar with his trademark dialogue. I admit when I first saw this film I hadn't studied his style and didn't know what the hell was going on. Particularly odd to me was why everybody kept calling each other ""Baby' all the time. So if you find yourself unimpressed after the first viewing please try it again and I think your opinion will change.

Even if you end up hating the film surely you can appreciate the brilliant performance of Val Kilmer. Kilmer is such a talented actor whose acting gets short shrift for stories that paint him as difficult to work with or just plain odd. Sure he is but how many films has he livened up with that kind of behavior? He was brilliant as Gay Perry in ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" but that was a supporting role. After you watch him in this film you will wish that he got more leading man opportunities.

Auteurs, who had their heyday in  the 1960s and '70s, are scarce in this era of corporatized $150 million blockbusters and calculated teen flicks. I can't think offhand of any other except Robert Altman, and I am becoming more and more impressed with Mamet. (I've never been unqualifiedly enthusiastic about Altman; see my review of Gosford Park if you're interested.)Both in his previous film, Heist, and in Spartan, Mamet shows a growing mastery of direction. Spartan is set in a rather sinister shadow-world of secret military operations ruled by unsavory civilians. It's an atmosphere that may make you cringe a little, but it's certainly germane to the storyline, and Mamet builds it up skillfully detail by detail. He even trusts the audience enough that for a few minutes at the film's beginning, you're not sure what you're watching or its meaning, only that it feels creepy.By the time it becomes clear what's at stake -- the president's daughter, a college student wasted on drugs, has been kidnapped, not for political reasons but by a sex-slave organization that doesn't even know who she is -- you understand why the secret mission to recover her is entrusted to the character played by Val Kilmer, tough enough to chew razor blades and for whom only accomplishing the mission matters.Mamet displays a knack here for mood painting through visuals and the apt musical score by Mark Isham. A black light shines through many a scene. I am emphasizing this side of Mamet's work because I don't think he gets as much credit for it as he deserves; what everyone remarks on is his dialogue.As usual, he puts plenty of abrasive poetry in the mouths of his characters, and adds little touches of eccentricity without getting carried away by them (as Altman so often does). He seems to be a good actor's director, too. Kilmer is certainly an asset, and Mamet gets strong performances out of a cast with few big names. Particularly striking is an actress I've never seen before by the name of  Kristen Bell (I won't tell you her role because it might be a spoiler if I did).Mamet, for all his much-noted facility with surprises and switches, isn't as good at plotting as he is at dialogue. Spartan falls into genre cliches at times and includes unlikely events and coincidences. Even when the script gets formulaic, though, Mamet's special brand of cinematic chemistry rarely lets up.",4,A black light shining,1089849600,"07 15, 2004",2004,2620,"['David', 'Mamet', 'one', 'few', 'practitioners', 'today', 'film', 'industry', 'who', 'can', 'justly', 'be', 'called', 'auteur', 'author', 'film', 'who', 'enough', 'control', 'project', 'bring', 'vision', 'more', 'less', 'intact', 'screen', 'Auteurs', 'who', 'had', 'heyday', '1960s', ""'70s"", 'are', 'scarce', 'era', 'corporatized', '150', 'million', 'blockbusters', 'calculated', 'teen', 'flicks', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'offhand', 'other', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'am', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'impressed', 'Mamet', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'unqualifiedly', 'enthusiastic', 'Altman', 'see', 'review', 'Gosford', 'Park', ""'re"", 'interested', 'previous', 'film', 'Heist', 'Spartan', 'Mamet', 'growing', 'mastery', 'direction', 'Spartan', 'set', 'rather', 'sinister', 'shadow-world', 'secret', 'military', 'operations', 'ruled', 'unsavory', 'civilians', 'atmosphere', 'may', 'make', 'cringe', 'little', 'certainly', 'germane', 'storyline', 'Mamet', 'builds', 'up', 'skillfully', 'detail', 'detail', 'even', 'audience', 'enough', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'beginning', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', ""'re"", 'watching', 'meaning', 'only', 'creepy.By', 'time', 'clear', 'what', 'stake', 'president', 'daughter', 'college', 'student', 'wasted', 'drugs', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'not', 'political', 'reasons', 'sex-slave', 'organization', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'who', 'understand', 'why', 'secret', 'mission', 'recover', 'entrusted', 'character', 'played', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'tough', 'enough', 'chew', 'razor', 'blades', 'whom', 'only', 'accomplishing', 'mission', 'matters.Mamet', 'displays', 'knack', 'here', 'mood', 'painting', 'visuals', 'apt', 'musical', 'score', 'Mark', 'Isham', 'A', 'black', 'light', 'shines', 'many', 'scene', 'am', 'emphasizing', 'side', 'Mamet', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'as', 'much', 'credit', 'what', 'everyone', 'remarks', 'dialogue.As', 'usual', 'plenty', 'abrasive', 'poetry', 'mouths', 'characters', 'little', 'touches', 'eccentricity', 'getting', 'carried', 'away', 'Altman', 'so', 'often', 'be', 'good', 'actor', 'director', 'too', 'Kilmer', 'certainly', 'asset', 'Mamet', 'strong', 'performances', 'cast', 'few', 'big', 'names', 'Particularly', 'striking', 'actress', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'name', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'role', 'might', 'be', 'spoiler', 'did', '.Mamet', 'much-noted', 'facility', 'surprises', 'switches', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'plotting', 'dialogue', 'Spartan', 'genre', 'cliches', 'times', 'unlikely', 'events', 'coincidences', 'Even', 'when', 'script', 'formulaic', 'though', 'Mamet', 'special', 'brand', 'cinematic', 'chemistry', 'rarely', 'up']",N/A

While Spartan is, once again, not that film, it does come closer than any other Mamet movie I've seen. (Except, of course, for House of Games.)Laura Newton (Veronica Mars' Kristen Bell) is a Senator's daughter who has a reputation for being somewhat wild. She disappears one night, and a team of Rangers headed by Scott (Val Kilmer) are brought in to try and find her. It's a simple plot, but this is David Mamet-- there's nothing simple about the details. Double-crosses, cover-ups, spin, incompetent government officials, red herrings, white slavery rings, ex-boyfriends, lecherous professors, the smell of American tobacco carrying in the desert...First off, because it has to be said: what's a David Mamet film without Ricky Jay? Okay, now that I've got that off my chest, it's a technically competent film, and the acting is credible (Kilmer, whose career has become notoriously inconsistent in the past ten years or so, gives one of his good performances here. Not great-- not Wonderland, certainly-- but good.), but it feels like there's a lot missing from this movie. The shallowness of Stoddard (William H. Macy, wasted in the role) has been pointed out more than enough that I can just mention it and move on. It's synecdochic, though; it feels as if there was a lot more of Stoddard in the first couple of drafts of the script (or perhaps in the film before it went to the editing room) and we ended up just getting the edges of the character. I got that feeling with a bunch of other stuff in this movie, too. Some things (can't say what without spoilers) seemed a bit too convenient, as if pieces around them had been trimmed off by editing when they should have been left in. That sort of thing. There's no specific thing I can point to and say 'this is what caused the movie to go downhill' for me; it's a bunch of little stuff that worked, but didn't work quite as well as it should have. That said, it's certainly a credible way to kill an hour and forty-five minutes; you just may end up feeling like you've had some empty calories on your plate after you're done. ***",3,Good brainless fun.,1185926400,"08 1, 2007",2007,2243,"['Spartan', 'David', 'Mamet', '2004', 'past', 'twenty', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'David', 'Mamet', 'direct', 'film', 'even', 'half', 'as', 'good', 'House', 'Games', 'Spartan', 'once', 'again', 'not', 'film', 'come', 'closer', 'other', 'Mamet', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'course', 'House', 'Games', 'Laura', 'Newton', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'Senator', 'daughter', 'who', 'reputation', 'being', 'somewhat', 'wild', 'one', 'night', 'team', 'Rangers', 'headed', 'Scott', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'are', 'brought', 'try', 'find', 'simple', 'plot', 'David', 'Mamet', 'nothing', 'simple', 'details', 'Double-crosses', 'cover-ups', 'spin', 'incompetent', 'government', 'officials', 'red', 'herrings', 'white', 'slavery', 'rings', 'ex-boyfriends', 'lecherous', 'professors', 'smell', 'American', 'tobacco', 'carrying', 'desert', 'First', 'off', 'be', 'said', 'what', 'David', 'Mamet', 'film', 'Ricky', 'Jay', 'Okay', 'now', ""'ve"", 'got', 'chest', 'technically', 'competent', 'film', 'acting', 'credible', 'Kilmer', 'career', 'become', 'notoriously', 'inconsistent', 'past', 'ten', 'years', 'so', 'one', 'good', 'performances', 'here', 'Not', 'great', 'not', 'Wonderland', 'certainly', 'good', 'lot', 'missing', 'movie', 'shallowness', 'Stoddard', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'wasted', 'role', 'been', 'pointed', 'out', 'more', 'can', 'just', 'mention', 'move', 'synecdochic', 'though', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'Stoddard', 'first', 'couple', 'drafts', 'script', 'perhaps', 'film', 'went', 'editing', 'room', 'ended', 'up', 'just', 'getting', 'edges', 'character', 'got', 'feeling', 'bunch', 'other', 'stuff', 'movie', 'too', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'what', 'spoilers', 'seemed', 'bit', 'too', 'convenient', 'pieces', 'had', 'been', 'trimmed', 'off', 'editing', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'sort', 'thing', 'specific', 'thing', 'can', 'point', 'say', 'what', 'caused', 'movie', 'go', 'downhill', 'bunch', 'little', 'stuff', 'worked', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'quite', 'as', 'well', 'should', 'have', 'said', 'certainly', 'credible', 'way', 'kill', 'hour', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'just', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'feeling', ""'ve"", 'had', 'empty', 'calories', 'plate', ""'re"", 'done', '***']",N/A

Zwick,"[8, 18]","**1/2 After ""First Daughter,"" ""Chasing Liberty"" and now ""Spartan,"" it would appear that there is no task in life more challenging than being the daughter of the President of the United States.  All those secret service agents and all that media attention - what's a good, clean-cut, All-American girl to do?  Those first two movies were ostensibly comedies, but ""Spartan"" is a crime drama in which the President's daughter is abducted by kidnappers and sold into white slavery!  Hey, come to think of it, maybe this movie is a comedy too. Val Kilmer is the rogue secret agent who winds up going to Dubai in search of the young woman after everyone else - the First Family included! - has given her up for dead and seemingly moved onto more important things in their lives.As this is a David Mamet film, it takes us awhile to adjust to the movie`s pacing and style.  The plotting is complex and frequently convoluted, and, as always, the characters speak in mannered, high-falutin' riddles that often serve to diminish rather than to enhance meaning and clarity.  Still, it is this deliberate ambiguity, this heightened artificiality in the writing and acting that generally provide the major distinction and pleasure of any Mamet film.  Unfortunately, ""Spartan,"" despite all the cleverness of its dialogue, simply can't overcome the inherent silliness of its basic premise.  The film would have us believe that the President of the United States would agree to have his daughter rubbed out by his political advisors because her rather footloose and unchaste lifestyle is becoming a drag on his reelection prospects!  Once we realize that this is where the story is headed, our patience pretty much runs out, and all we are left with is an arch, pretentious film that we find increasingly difficult to take seriously.Val Kilmer has no trouble getting into the Mamet spirit, modeling his highly stylized performance on film noir tough guys like Cagney, Bogart and Robinson.  I guess that ""Spartan"" is itself intended as some sort of homage to the film noir genre, but there have been far better ones than this in recent years.  It's true that when Mamet fails, he does so at a level much higher than most of his filmmaking contemporaries, and ""Spartan"" is certainly not without its assorted virtues and pleasures.  It's perhaps worth seeing if you're a viewer in search of a different kind of crime drama (and aren't we all, come to think of it?), and it might be better if you go into this thinking of it as almost a parody of the genre than a straight crime drama on its own.

Val Kilmer captures well the steely focus of the hired mercenary who goes after the international white-slave traders who kidnap a prominent politician's daughter. Mamet happily celebrates the toughest and most dedicated of this fraternity of shadowy loners ready to obey the command of any superior. Neither strategists nor tacticians, they are skilled at tracking down and killing bad guys. Period.This being Mamet, of course, it's not that simple. The plot takes one unexpected turn after another, and appearances are invariably deceiving.

The film has a great look to it, and Kilmer is good as the tough &quot;mission first&quot; agent Scott.  The dialogue is tough, but in a way that has you thinking here's a (good) poet writing noir.  For example, the repetitions regarding the need to &quot;find the girl&quot; was poet-cool, and dropped at just about the moment it would of started to get annoying.  The fact she's the President's daughter is left unsaid, at least until the midway point, but you are able to make this connection with that fact unsaid. (And the unseen &quot;President&quot; in &quot;Spartan&quot; seems to be a combo of Clinton &amp; Bush: a warmongering whoremonger.) But it's also at about the midway point that Kilmer has a conversation with a female agent that had been assigned to protect the President's daughter over the years.  It has to be one of the most unintentionally funny scenes I've seen in a good movie in quite a while, and had me picking up on other &quot;moments&quot; as the movie went on.  (But not enough to wreck the film, by any means.)  On the bad side, super character actor William Macy is nearly wasted, a virtual non-entity for most of the movie. No doubt this role was as Mamet envisioned it, a character flying beneath radar, for that twist at the end.  But if that's the case, a more anonymous actor would of been a better choice. On the good side, Ed O'Neil, as the ruthless Burch, further cements his own credentials as one of Hollywood's best character actors. And watch and listen carefully, or you will miss the why of the title.  Not an exact fit, but it worked for me, in a wonderfully (and classically) understated way, and fit Kilmer's character as we'd grown to know him.  Definitely worth a watch.

That this slick political thriller would go pear shaped at the box office seems more than a little unfair, considering that far less accomplished films have cut better figures.Sure, the setting may seem a little musty with all the big tykes from the FBI, the Secret Service, Special Ops and the CIA making an appearance in a criss-cross of motives (kidnap of the President's daughter). But there are still con-tricks and plot twists aplenty, all punctuated by Mamet's signature dialogue, which is as clipped as the mannerisms of the actors. The plot twists are not the usual cerebral kind that we have come to expect from him. They're more action oriented.Spartan almost plays in real-time, with us, the audience unraveling the meandering plot along with the characters in the film. It whisks us in a dizzy rush of events. We are not given time to think, we are not supposed to think; this is not a reflective film. There is nothing beneath the surface, nothing new. Stop and think, and all sorts of huge implausibilities immediately become apparent.But to its credit it chugs along with commendable pace and purpose.

I thought the dialogue was just bad and I just couldn't get into it. But for some reason I got it at a good price on DVD and I gave it another shot. As I watched it the second, third, fourth and other times I came to find that I liked it more and more. I began appreciating the strange cadence of the dialogue in that it wasn't like anything else that I had heard. Also things that I thought would happen if it was a typical hollywood movie...didn't. Val Kilmer was very good at this strange kind of clunky, hard to ride style and script. William H. Macy and 'Al Bundy' were also in the cast. Ah, who knows, maybe I just like Val Kilmer cause with dialogue like, ""why weren't you prepared?"", ""Where IS the girl"" (repeated for what seemed like 20 times in the exact same way by different characters...

Warning: You need a 3-digit I.Q. to appreciate his work.There are great supporting actors, like William Macy, and Ed O`Neill (Al Bundy), as CIA Director Burch. Reading the other reviews, it seems that many people saw this film because it had Val Kilmer in it, and they were disappointed because Val Kilmer did not act like he has acted in other films. Do not see this fim because Val Kilmer is in it. Watch Tombstone again instead. See this film because it is by David Mamet.Also check out House of Games, and, Things Change. Another negative theme common to the other reviews is the flat emotion or stiff acting of the actors. Trained killers do not parade their emotions. Not that I`ve been around all that many trained killers, but the military people I`ve been around have been just as ""stiff"" as the types portrayed in Spartan, as far as emotional expressiveness goes. If you are looking for emotional expressiveness, perhaps you would enjoy the many excellent films with Shirley Temple.I had a big problem with one scene. At the rural grocery store near the end of the first half, Scott (Val Kilmer) shoots the death-row convict he and his partner are taking to prison. He shoots him after the convict yelled ""He's a cop!"" and then shot and wounded his partner. When Scott shoots the convict, the convict is holding his shotgun at port arms (pointing it up in the sky, not in a ready position). The convict still believes Scott (Kilmer) is on his side. Had Scott stayed with the mission, he and the convict would have continued with their plan. Scott would not have killed him and nearly ruined the chance to get Laura Newton back. Why did he shoot and kill him? He posed no danger to Scott.
