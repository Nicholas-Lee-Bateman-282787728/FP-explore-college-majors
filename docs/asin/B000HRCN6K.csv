Ginger Rogers witnesses this terrible crime and is really shook up and afraid; especially when she discovers that her future brother-in-law was involved.

Assaults on uppity darkies who sat at white-reserved lunch counters? Lynching of blacks who'd ogled white women?Er, no. The big secret was that the leaders of the Klan enjoyed a wide profit margin in the sale of those white-sheet uniforms.The makers of the movie wanted to have it both ways. They attacked a target which it was politically correct to attack, but then they had a hard time figuring why it should be attacked. Because it persecuted blacks? But the potential audience might not much like blacks, or Jews, or any of the other real-life victims of the Klan. So the word ""negro"" is never used.

The film is about a Klan murder which is witnessed by the ""outsider"" sister who is in town to visit her sister (Doris Day).

I didn't realize Ginger Rogers was such a quality actress, she did a fine job in this film.  I guess I always thought of her in those more corny roles where she dances with Dean Martin or Fred Astaire, whoever it was.Ronald Reagan plays the county or town prosecuting attorney and the best scene comes right at the end when shows up at a huge klan rally and delivers this quote after being threatened with a firearm and some kind of official sounding diatribe, ""Don't give me that Halioween Routine.""  It's funny how he recognizes everybody in the klan, and they all scatter when Reagan gets tough, just like the communists did.

1015449,A36NF437WZLQ9E,B000HRCN6K,W. Powell,"[2, 5]","All in all not a bad movie to watch given it was made in 1950.  The beginning has a great film-noir style setup with dark themes and scenes.  But then actor Ronald Reagan enters as a wannabe tough guy in the role of detective/prosecutor and the hitchcock type magic is lost.  It was like watching a mediocre magician's act, where you know the outcome of the trick but you watch anyway hoping this time the magician surprises you with a new twist on the outcome.Good acting by Ginger Rogers probably saved this movie from being a complete flop.  Though the movie attempted to expose and belittle the white supremacist ku klux klan organization and its hold on a small town, the main focus was on Rogers as a concerned sister reluctant to indict her sister's husband (a klan member) for a crime she witnessed him commit. Yes, its a crime detective story where you know who did it and why before the detective does.This movie might've been ahead of its time in dealing with a serious american terrorist issue, but by depicting the root of this klan klavern as a few crazed and corrupt individuals, it gives the dangerously misleading perception of civic and community innocence when it came to klan activity.  But give hollywood credit, their history of pulling a rabbit out of a hat and convincing viewers that its real has stood the test of time.""Storm Warning"" would've made a better book.  I'm currently reading ""Blood Justice"" by Howard Smead. Its the true story of the 1959 Lynching of Mack CHarles Parker in Mississippi.
