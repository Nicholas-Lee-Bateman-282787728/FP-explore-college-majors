Parts of the film seem silly especially now that I am all grown-up, but it's just one of those films that make you feel good because it's simple and harmless. Directed by Carl Reiner, Summer Rental is a about a man who wants his family to spend a great and relaxing summer at the beach but when he realizes they have the wrong address, things take a turn for the worse. Their beach house is anything but relaxing, it's a little too close to the beach and crazy things start to happen. Well I don't want to spoil the rest but I will tell the rest of the film involves a boat.

Things immediately go wrong: their supposedly beautiful beach rental turns out to be a delapidated shack. Jack falls asleep and fries to a crisp in the subtropical sun. Lifeguards are clearly flirting with Chester's daughter Jennifer (Green), and strangers trek through the family ""digs"" on their way to the ocean. Poor Jack's nerves are worse than ever!He becomes friends with Scully (Torn), the one-handed owner of a floating restaurant. Colorfully crusty Scully gives Jack sailing lessons, and he's an apt pupil.After his run-in with obnoxious landlord Al Pellet (Crenna), Jack and family are ordered to vacate their crummy rental. The wealthy playboy Pellet has won the local sailing regatta for seven straight years, so in revenge Jack plays on the man's pride by telling Al he will defeat him in the upcoming race. The only catch: Jack doesn't own a boat!""Summer Rental"" is available onDVD.Related item:ONE CRAZY SUMMER (1986) is another vacation-themed film.

Basically, it's a comedy where everything goes wrong for John Candy's character the entire movie. You can definitely tell it's from the 80's! Just one funny thing that happens is his family mistakenly stays at first in a really nice beach house, until the actual family that lives there comes home. When they finally move to the right address, the house is about 10x worse looking. To make things worse, they are right next to the path from the beach, so they get all the beach traffic too. Another funny event is when John Candy's character and his family go to a nice seafood restaurant and end up waiting over an hour for a table, only to have a rich guy come in and take their table and the last lobsters in the tank.

214057,A2FDFWRBCU8ERY,6300214621,Daddy,"[0, 0]","This is a fairly simple '80s comedy, often funny, very cute, and completely loveable. The basic story is a burned out air-traffic-controller (John Candy) takes a mandatory vacation with his family. They stay at a rented beach-house that his boss loaned to him. The laughs are plentiful as they begin by staying at the wrong house, then move into the right house and deal with all the usual tourist problems. The best part of the story and the most fun is when Candy makes friends with a local pirate/restaurant owner (Rip Torn) who teaches him how to sail. He challenges a local businessman - who has been causing him grief - to the Regatta, an annual boat race. There's more to the story than that, but I don't want to be too wordy in my review.As pointed out by some reviewers, there are some funny bits that have been edited out of dvd or vhs versions. If you can find a complete version, watch it. But, even edited down, it's still fun.  This movie has loads of funny bits and loveable characters.

I don't think he really had a chance to shine in this one.John Candy works as an air traffic controller.  He works too hard and has to take a trip to Florida to cool off.  His first day there he becomes arch enemies with the local snob sailboat captain.  With a setup like this, it is inevitable that he have to defeat the snob captain in a sailboat race.This movie is pretty predictable stuff, in my opinion.  If you want maximum John Candy try Planes, Trains, and Automobiles or Uncle Buck.  If you want a vacation movie, try National Lampoon's Vacation, or another good John Candy flick, The Great Outdoors.

Some of these, while excellent quality films, and great to see once, do not have what I refer to as ""watchability"".A ""MW"" film is one that is great for it's pure entertainment value.  Likeable characters.  Fun and interesting and endearing performances.  Clever and witty dialog that seemingly gets better with time.  A film that is like visiting an old friend (if you don't mind me getting a bit cliche, myself).Anyway, Summer Rental, is one of those MW films.

For example the subplot involving John Larroquette is never given the chance to become anything. His whole presence in the movie is totally pointless and I suspect there was a whole ""Candy's wife may be cheating on him"" plot that was cut out because it just too similar Chase/D'Angelo in Vacation.We never know what happens to Richard Crenna or Rip Torn after the Regatta and we never know how the rest of the Summer Rental went. It's like the writers knew there was no plot, chucked in this Regatta crap and thought that would be a good place to end the film when it's over. And what was wrong with the popcorn Candy and Crenna eat? I found that pretty weird.Although I have already made comparisons to Vacation I still feel like this film is good enough without being a copycat movie. It's seems more realistic and doesn't have any slapstick humor. Candy feels more like a real guy who needs a real vacation. We want him to relax but still can't help laughing when everything goes wrong. My fave scene is when he returns home to find it transformed into some kind of free-for-all Funhouse.But for a film set in Florida there is a huge lack of nice scenery and the photography isn't so cool. I wonder why Kerri Green (who starred in The Goonies the same year) never made another mainstream movie tho. Joey Laurence did so why not her?If you like comedies, but hate the scatological humor that most present day comedies have, then this is a good enough escape.

Such is the case with ""Summer Rental,"" where John Candy plays air traffic controller Jack Chester.  As everyone knows, air traffic controllers lead a stressful life, and all Jack is looking forward to is getting away from it all.We can tell from the outset that getting away is going to be difficult.  Children Jennifer (Kerri Green, who starred the same year in ""Goonies"" and the following year in ""Lucas"") and Bobby (Joey or Joseph Lawrence) are fighting in the car during the trip to the beach.  Once at the beach things get difficult.  Their stuckup landlord does not like either Jack or his family, and tries to boot them out.  Jack thinks he is going to get killed when pretty neighbor Vicki Sanders (Lois Hamilton) asks him to feel how real her augmentation is and husband Ed (Carmine Caridi) walks in.  Fortunately Vicki has been doing that a lot and Ed takes it in stride.  However, clutzy Jack also ends up breaking a leg.  With all this action it seems that things are unable to get worse, which means they do.Al Pellet (Richard Crenna) has agreed to race them, in a regatta.  If they win the race they can stay in the rental.  If they lose, they must leave.  At long last the Chester family pulls together, with help from Scully (Rip Torn) and a bizarre crew.  The group turns a restaurant into a real ship, barely making the race in time.The joy of this movie is the last half hour.  There are short moments where the movie slows a bit, but in general the pace in the last half hour is quick.  In light comedies of this type, it is the ending where all the issues are resolved and everyone, except for the jerks, come out ahead.John Candy generally ends up as the straight man in this movie.  The funny parts are what happens to John more than what John says.  John performs well in this movie, which was his first as the star.Other than the brief scene with the breast augmentation, where the exposed portions stay out of camera view, this movie is somewhat family friendly.

""Summer Rental"" is a great funny movie! It really shows the bonding (and annoying but funny) family matters on a supposed to be vacation, but ends as a night mare!When I first sat down to watch this movie I was thinking what was the point of this movie? I kept watching it hoping something big would happen and it did! A lot of exiting and funny scenes are coming your way.The ""epic vacation"" starts when a guy with a normal family, normal life, normal day has quite a bad start at work where he directs planes that are landing. On the way to work he meets some rude drivers and to top that, one guy parks way too close to him. Not a very good day at work and his boss forces him to take a vacation. This ""vacation"" has lots of problems for the guy whose name is Jack and a few problems for his family. But there are number of exciting events on this vacation.This movie is very funny and has a lot of lessons you can learn from it. That's all nice but there are a lot of inappropriate scenes in this movie as well a bit of inappropriate language. This movie may be funny to adults and teens but it's not geared for younger kids. The jokes are more geared for adults as well. I have to say my favorite scene is when Jack and his son go sailing but fail miserably. They make a hole in a much bigger boat and make an enemy as well. His son asks if his dad is ok, because Jack hits his leg badly and then the boy stands up for his father. This scene demonstrates how close those two areI recommend this to ages 13 to 18. There are just a few minor items where I would add a bit more clarification but overall it's a great film so I would give it 5 out 5 stars. Reviewed by Gerry O., KIDS FIRST!
