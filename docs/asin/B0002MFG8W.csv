840141,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B0002MFG8W,Andy Orrock,"[10, 12]","Another peculiar and muddled US marketing campaign has buried any chance that a smart little Spanish release like ""My Mother Likes Women"" will find an audience here stateside.  Let's start with the fact that the DVD coverbox and trailer push this as some sort of generic ensemble with a bunch of Spanish actresses that the distributors are sure we've never heard of.  So, we're told that this movie stars Rosa Maria Sadra, Leonor Watling and Maria Pujalte, and - oh by the way - Watling was in ""Bad Education"" and ""In the City.""Well now.  This is not an ensemble movie.  It's Watling's film, plain and simple.  She's one of Spain's hottest stars.  In fact, she's one of Europe's hottest stars.  And, of her credits, there's the small matter of her breakout star turn in Almodovar's ""Talk to Her,"" which just goes without mention anywhere in the marketing.  By contrast, her role in ""Bad Education"" is small and uncredited.  A bit of a star turn for her friend, Mr. Almodovar.  Failing to ride the draft of Ms. Watling's true source of fame is a huge missed opportunity.  She's frenetic and charming here as the self-doubting, shakily confident Elvira.The DVD release has nothing on it in terms of attractive extras.  The only thing worth glancing at is the trailer.  Watch it after the movie to see how pathetically low-rent and off-base it is.  It does the movie absolutely no service or justice at all.One kudo due the distributors:  the sub-titles are extraordinarily well-done.  One of the protagonists is a Czech emigree to Spain and she speaks fluent but slightly broken Spanish.  The sub-titles do a wonderful job evoking the essence of her fractured speaking style.",4,"Nice, fun little movie with Leonor Watling.

840146,A3D09XGX4FOLSB,B0002MFG8W,KinoChelovek,"[0, 0]","I am always worried when I see movies released by lesser companies.  Wolfe Video is a hit-or-miss distributor, and I own, seen, and enjoyed many of their features.  This is definitely well-worth snagging.Briefly, it is about three daughters who are attempting to come to terms with their mother's new-found love, a Czech lesbian who is studying on a visa in Spain (both her and her mother are pianists).  The story follows the middle daughter, Elvira, played by the wonderful Leonor Watling (who would star as a comatose woman in great Almodovar movie ""Talk to Her,"" also released in 2002).  The family is dysfunctional, but not of the way-over-the-top type.  The daughters attempt to break up their mother and her love, who is the same age as they are, while attempting to come to terms with their own relationship troubles.  I will not go further.The movie is not just about a mother's coming-out to her family.  It's about relationships between parents, sisters, lovers, and employers; I believe this is where its strength lies.  Watling is the star of the movie, but all of the other acting talents never wane.  Unlike other lesbian-centered movies, this one doesn't put men down, nor does it treats them with contempt.  I found it realistic this way.  The writing is not complexly layered, which could have easily happened in this movie - the screenwriter and director should be given high credits for that.I loved the song ""My Mother Likes Women"" that is performed on stage by the youngest daughter to the chagrin of the family.  It's a catchy tune!This movie can easily be compared to another movie from Spain called ""Only Human"" (2004).  That movie is about a quasi-devout Jewish family in Madrid who slowly comes to terms with their daughter's boyfriend, a Palestinian.  These two movies may make a great film analysis paper.  One may even see a bit of Woody Allen-type storytelling in both films, too.There are some extras on the DVD, all of which are run-of-the-mill for Wolfe.  I am unsure why many people dislike the movie.  Maybe it is the lesbian content?  Remember, just so the title and the main story is about lesbianism doesn't make it a bad film, nor does it mean it is all about lesbians!5 strong stars.

When Sofia introduces daughters Elvira (Leonor Watling), Jimena (Maria Pujalte) and Sol (Silvia Abascal) to her new love Czechoslovakian pianist Eliska (Eliska Sirova), they are dumbfounded. Not so much that Eliska is 20 years younger than their mother, but that she is involved in a lesbian affair.The sisters each with their own issues, have difficulty accepting their mother's new relationship and plot to breakup it up by one of them seducing Eliska themselves, but at what cost and can the damage be undone?Filmmakers Daniela Fejerman and Ines Paris have created a wonderfully insightful variation on the middle-aged lesbian falling in love story. This comedy deals with the fallout of family rejection of a relationship and how each must reassess their own prejudices to continue as a family.Rosa Maria Sarda is believable as young at heart Sofia who has not only come out late in life, but also somehow managed to snag a younger woman along with it. Leonor Watling, Maria Pujalte and Silvia Abascal portray the bigoted daughters; there are particularly comical moments when they try to decide who will attempt to seduce Eliska.Chris AldersonAuthor of the 2013 Lesbian Film Guide",4,Insightful variation on coming out...,1368230400,"05 11, 2013",2013,1346,"['Set', 'Madrid', 'long', 'divorced', 'Sofia', 'Rosa', 'Maria', 'Sarda', 'daughters', 'together', 'birthday', 'celebration', 'announce', 'found', 'love', 'again', 'When', 'Sofia', 'daughters', 'Elvira', 'Leonor', 'Watling', 'Jimena', 'Maria', 'Pujalte', 'Sol', 'Silvia', 'Abascal', 'new', 'love', 'Czechoslovakian', 'pianist', 'Eliska', 'Eliska', 'Sirova', 'are', 'dumbfounded', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'Eliska', '20', 'years', 'younger', 'mother', 'involved', 'lesbian', 'affair.The', 'sisters', 'own', 'issues', 'have', 'difficulty', 'accepting', 'mother', 'new', 'relationship', 'plot', 'breakup', 'up', 'one', 'seducing', 'Eliska', 'what', 'cost', 'can', 'damage', 'be', 'undone', 'Filmmakers', 'Daniela', 'Fejerman', 'Ines', 'Paris', 'have', 'created', 'wonderfully', 'insightful', 'variation', 'middle-aged', 'lesbian', 'falling', 'love', 'story', 'comedy', 'fallout', 'family', 'rejection', 'relationship', 'how', 'must', 'reassess', 'own', 'prejudices', 'continue', 'family.Rosa', 'Maria', 'Sarda', 'believable', 'young', 'heart', 'Sofia', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'come', 'out', 'late', 'life', 'also', 'somehow', 'managed', 'snag', 'younger', 'woman', 'Leonor', 'Watling', 'Maria', 'Pujalte', 'Silvia', 'Abascal', 'portray', 'bigoted', 'daughters', 'are', 'particularly', 'comical', 'moments', 'when', 'try', 'decide', 'who', 'will', 'attempt', 'seduce', 'Eliska.Chris', 'AldersonAuthor', '2013', 'Lesbian', 'Film', 'Guide']",My Mother Likes Women
