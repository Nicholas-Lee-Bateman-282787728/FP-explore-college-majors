As a matter of fact, Seinbeck's book and movie covered the great migration to California, and not the dust bowl per se.There isn't a lot of history available through the years on the dust bowl.  But, to see this, is best described as shocking!  It is incredible how this happened, how man played a role in it, and the effects this disastrous historic catastrophy played out.If you see a Ken Burns documentary, you know you will learn and you know it will be a thorough lesson.  This is thorough, with family accounts, beautiful images of people, images of the monstrous clouds of dust.  What is striking is the images, the faces, beautiful scenes with families.  These pictures were done by a mass of photographers who were hired to capture images.Added to the images are plenty of live footage of this storm.  And to add to the storm, were stories of drought, dust pneumonia, the effects of the depression, the mass killing of rabbits, the invasion of grasshoppers, the death of animals, etc.The film also takes you to the migration out to Calfornia and the treatment endured by those ""okies"".Again, if you have never truly learned what the Dust Bowl was...... view this film!",5,"Dust, Drought, Depression",1375056000,"07 29, 2013",2013,1305,"['only', 'thing', 'know', 'Dust', 'Bowl', ""Steinbeck'sThe"", 'Grapes', 'Wrath', 'then', 'are', 'shrewd', 'awakening', 'matter', 'fact', 'Seinbeck', 'book', 'movie', 'covered', 'great', 'migration', 'California', 'not', 'dust', 'bowl', 'se.There', ""n't"", 'lot', 'history', 'available', 'years', 'dust', 'bowl', 'see', 'best', 'described', 'shocking', 'incredible', 'how', 'happened', 'how', 'man', 'played', 'role', 'effects', 'disastrous', 'historic', 'catastrophy', 'played', 'out.If', 'see', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'documentary', 'know', 'will', 'learn', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'thorough', 'lesson', 'thorough', 'family', 'accounts', 'beautiful', 'images', 'people', 'images', 'monstrous', 'clouds', 'dust', 'What', 'striking', 'images', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'families', 'pictures', 'were', 'done', 'mass', 'photographers', 'who', 'were', 'hired', 'capture', 'images.Added', 'images', 'are', 'plenty', 'live', 'footage', 'storm', 'add', 'storm', 'were', 'stories', 'drought', 'dust', 'pneumonia', 'effects', 'depression', 'mass', 'killing', 'rabbits', 'invasion', 'grasshoppers', 'death', 'animals', 'etc.The', 'film', 'also', 'migration', 'Calfornia', 'treatment', 'endured', 'okies', '.Again', 'have', 'never', 'truly', 'learned', 'what', 'Dust', 'Bowl', 'was', 'view', 'film']",N/A

After years living in the region and with parents who were adults during the era, I was already attracted to the subject.  Came away underwhelmed.Plus:  an economical, personal, anecdotal story, focused on how individuals viewed and responded to the tragedy -- then and now; realistic (if limited) description of anthropogenic influence on the ecological disaster (as opposed to ""evil"" or ""punishment from God""); extending the story to the 1/4 who left, including ""okies"", was fascinating; excellent maps, but far too few of them; enjoyed Peter Coyote again as narrator, also interviews with Tim Egan.  As ever, Burns et al. found some great story tellers!Minus:  DVD extras were repetitive, derivative, seemed ad hoc, mostly an afterthought; editing of individuals' narratives wasn't sufficiently taut; story held only loosely to sequential flow of events; most of the music (except for Woody Guthrie's) came as a subdued background, not always on point -- unlike Civil War, WWII, Prohibition, et al., where the music was a major character in itself.Suggestions?  First:  a strong anchoring to the calendar would have held me much closer to the story.  A few minutes setting the physical, climatological, geological, biological, et al., backgrounds in place would have helped me greatly.  Yes, the way the sod was broken was hugely consequential, as was the later introduction of contour plowing and terracing.  (Soil conservation was part of my grade school curriculum in the 1950s.)  And the WWI wheat bubble + the Great Depression were proximate causes of the financial disaster.  But we know more now about the regional climatological causes and feedbacks now, don't we?  Would have loved to have seen graphs of rainfall, maps of distribution of removed & deposited soil, maps of temperature and rainfall trends -- all as a function of time, interviews of scientists *with* cultural anthropologists.  We learned how many stayed put:  how many died, of starvation or dust pneumonia or other?  what areas of No Man's Land have 'recovered', and how (other than by accessing the Ogallala Aquifer)? was the wind worse during those years than before or after, and what cause(d)/(s) the powerful winds? Just why didn't the Dust Bowl eat its way further eastward?  Where did all that wind-blown soil end up?  Any North Atlantic/Mississippi Delta core sample data? etc. etc.The single most powerful impression I received from the first couple of hours was Horror.  If I weren't descended from centuries of farmers, if my mother hadn't been a starving teenager already before the Crash, if my Daddy hadn't used his time in the CCC to become an engineer, perhaps I would have been even less invested.  Once the horror had set in, though, it faded too quickly.How about some 'then vs. now' images taken along Route 64,66 / I-40?It's been my custom to play Ken Burns' films many times to glean all their info; not expecting to need to do so this time.

1538989,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B007VYEB44,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[0, 0]","I love Ken Burns documentaries.  Ever since I first watched Lewis and Clark I was hooked.  I've come to expect greatness from his works.  The War was phenomenal, and Prohibition was simply masterful (despite my apprehension before watching).  (For the record, his Mark Twain documentary is my favorite.  Please watch it if you have not seen it.)  So I requested this documentary from the library on Blu-Ray.  It is 4 hours on two Blu-Ray discs.  Narrated very well by Peter Coyote.The problem is that this documentary seems a lot less layered than his others.  It really comes as a repetitive series of stills and accounts.  Granted, there is some brilliant work here (why the four star rating), but towards the middle it chugs.Early on I enjoyed the depictions of the so called 'experts' and the land sellers.  The photos were great, even the elderly folks recounting eye witness testimony was great.  But four hours seems a bit long, especially when the central two hours are rehashes of the same pictures and similar accounts and stories.  It didn't have that magical flow that his other documentaries had.Another key letdown is that the Blu-Ray is really not necessary.  Some of the photos are clear of course, but there is really nothing stand out about this on Blu-Ray that I don't get from DVD.  So if you don't have access to the Blu-Ray or want to save a few dollars, then you really aren't missing out.  The extras are the same on either version.The story is one that should be told and should be heard, especially with the current climate issues.  These were people who could not leave the land, they had nowhere else to go.  They watched as friends and family died.  They watched as their parents were forced to slaughter sick and starving cattle.  I enjoyed the story very much and I think it's a wonderful documentary.

This aspect of this chapter of the American Experience was not told to me when I learned American history...and I thank Ken Burns for explaining it so well.  As he documents the facts through archival films, letters, and interviews with survivors, we harmed the land through ignorance.  Men and women wilfully destroyed the necessary wild grasses that evolved over time to hold the soil together in the Great Plains. Without those grasses, the newer soil would no longer hold moisture.  As it turned out, the most shocking scenes in the film are those of black, long walls of new tractors destroying those grasses, upturning the valuable soil.  Forget horror movies....this is real terror. {Not unlike the 1918 influenza pandemic}.  Man's most dangerous enemy...is himself.In the documentary, Ken Burns reminds us that Native Americans of the Great Plains experienced their ""end of the world"" disaster when we recklessly slaughtered their buffalo herds.  Did we think we could not do this to ourselves? The plague of grasshoppers that ate everything in sight in the Dust Bowl is of equal ferocity to the one predicted by Moses in the Old Testament.In 1956, Life Magazine had a cover which warned of serious global climate change if Americans did not make modifications to wasteful, destructive lifestyles.  That warning to respect the Earth was ignored. Today, the victims of Hurricane Sandy experienced first hand what devastating effects of global warming can do to Americans - miserable droughts. ferocious storms, and unimaginable floods.

Lots of incredible photos and short interviews with survivors, as well as a few short clips that bring home the enormity of this man-made disaster. The film follows several families through that period, most notably that of Caroline Henderson. Existing buffalo grass had roots that went down five or so feet and held down the topsoil, despite droughts (area averaged less than 20"" of rain/year) and occasional tramplings by buffaloes and other animals. Then came the Homestead Act and increased demand for American wheat after WWI cut off Russian supplies and created a need to feed millions of troops. Millions of acres of virgin land were then plowed up to grow cheap wheat, and for awhile it worked well for all. Many farmers mortgaged their land to expand their houses or to buy other land and/or equipment. Then came both a multi-year drought and an eventual plunge in wheat prices - down to 17 cents/bushel, less than half the cost of producing it. Those living in the area suffered through repeated dust storms towering thousands of feet in the air that brought darkness at noon, as well as sand storms that could last days. Livestock and people (especially the very young and old) died, and other animals simply wandered off as the drifts covered most of the fences. Dust was everywhere inside the people's homes; wearing dust masks (homemade or purchased) and goggles was often necessary. A horde of rabbits came as well - farmers had killed all the coyotes. In 1938 it was a horde of grasshoppers. About 850 million tons of topsoil were blown away in 1935 alone. Dust storms averaged about one in three days.The worst storms would bring dust to the East coast 4 - 5 days later. Overall, the Dust Bowl lasted a decade - eventually ended via increased rain, CCC planting of 217 million trees providing 218,000 miles of windbreaks, and the benefits of contour plowing, taking 4 million acres out of production. A shorter version returned in the early 1950s, now no longer an issue thanks to pumping from the Ogallala underground reservoir - now only about 20 years' worth of water left.The government tried to help stabilize livestock prices by buying up many herds - they were then shot and buried on location. Property values crashed, mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures were everywhere, displacing many and sending them to California.

1539044,A1BVCH82W0M2W2,B007VYEB44,"Paul Tognetti ""The real world is so much more...","[7, 8]","It is one of the most gut-wrenching films I have ever seen.  Like an episode of the old TV series ""Time Tunnel"" noted filmmaker Ken Burns transports his audience back to the Great Plains in the 1930's.  The stories of personal hardship and determination in his brand new PBS offering ""The Dust Bowl"" will likely hit you like a ton of bricks.  This is a story that needs to be told again and again.  As you will discover in ""The Dust Bowl"" this was in a good many ways a  self-imposed tragedy.  It is extremely important that the American people understand just what went wrong with the land in America's mid-section during those tumultuous years and to learn the hard lessons from this monumental environmental disaster.  The sad fact of the matter is that unless we are vigilant it could very well happen again.I first became interested in the Dust Bowl when I read Timothy Egan's outstanding book  ""The Worst Hard Time: The Untold Story of Those Who Survived The Great American Dust Bowl"" back in 2006.  Prior to that my knowledge of this calamity had been limited to not much more than a passing reference in a high school history book and perhaps a few articles in the newspaper.  I simply had no idea of the scope and the magnitude of this tragedy.  It appears to me that the four-hour presentation that Ken Burns has cobbled together is largely based on that book.  In fact, Timothy Egan appears throughout the film offering his informed commentary on the heartbreaking story that is unfolding before your very eyes.  In ""The Dust Bowl"" Ken Burns focuses on about a dozen families who had settled in various parts of the affected region.  These were hardy folks who came to settle in this area from many different places and for a variety of reasons.  It was the height of the Great Depression and for most the lure of farming your own tract of land was just too enticing to pass up.  For an all too brief time it appeared to be a wise decision.  But as the 1930's progressed most of the people who had settled in places like Boise City in the Oklahoma panhandle, Dalhart in Northwestern Texas or Cimmaron County, New Mexico would rue the day they decided to settle there.  Something had gone horribly wrong with the land. Most would experience unspeakable hardship over the next several years and lose practically everything.  Surely, ""The Dust Bowl"" would prove to be an environmental disaster of almost epic proportions.Aside from Timothy Egan's insightful commentary ""The Dust Bowl"" also offers hundreds of truly unforgettable black and white photographs and vintage film footage that will leave you with an indelible image of the landscape in places like ""No Man's Land"" and Baca County, Colorado during the height of the ""Dust Bowl"" in the mid 1930's.  These scenes will break your heart and make you wonder how these people were able to cope with such devastation and economic deprivation that lingered for nearly a decade.  It is difficult to comprehend the magnitude of a crisis where millions upon millions of tons of prime topsoil blow away in violent storms.  In less than a generation what had been hundreds of millions of acres of prime grasslands had been destroyed, perhaps forever.  Discover just who was to blame for this calamity and learn about FDR's ambitious plans to resuscitate the area.With ""The Dust Bowl"" Ken Burns brings this debacle to the attention of a new generation of Americans.  Aside from reacquainting all of us with the who, what, when and where of this unfortunate chapter in American history, Ken Burns reminds us of the important lessons that we should have gleaned from these events.  The ""Dust Bowl"" was an environmental disaster of nearly biblical proportions.  And it could very well happen again. Towards the end of the film Burns points out some of highly questionable agricultural practices being utilized in the Great Plains even to this day.  They seem incredibly foolhardy and serve as a reminder that we human beings have incredibly short memories.  As is the case with just about every film that Ken Burns produces ""The Dust Bowl"" will captivate you from the opening scenes and hold your interest throughout.  Among other things you will discover the origins of the term ""dust bowl"" and hear some great tunes by the legendary Woody Guthrie.  This is history at it's very best.

In the space of four hours, Ken Burns tells you how it was on the great wide plains of America, in the 1930's, in the Dust Bowl.Ken Burns' real talent is his focus on the average man and woman. Rather than focusing on the famous, the politicians and celebrities (though they do come into play at times), he introduces us to names from history that we never knew. So, in 'The Dust Bowl,' we get the story of the college-trained writer who set up a homestead in no-man's land, finding her husband there. We hear the story of the family with nine children, and the ambition to pass on a square mile of fertile land to each of them. We hear the stories of children born into a world of blowing dust and dirt, of some who survive, and some who didn't make it.Make no mistake, this is a story of struggle and human endurance stretched to the limit, of hopes raised and then dashed again, year after year. It's a story of ecological disaster and deprivation. It's tough to watch and often heartbreaking.We learn the origins of the phrase ""dust bowl,"" and gain new appreciation for terms like ""duster"" and ""black blizzard,"" used to describe the frequent waves of windswept dirt and dust the washed across the plains in the 1930's, sometimes blowing across the country before their fury is spent. We learn about what it means to be a ""next-year people"" and the mantra of the Dust Bowl farmer: ""If it rains...""And all of this comes to us in photographs, in old film clips, in interviews with men and women who were children of the Dust Bowl, from letters and diary excerpts read by talented voices, as though the people of that time were speaking to us from across the years.And what comes through is this: while the story of the Dust Bowl is a story of hardship and tragedy, it's also a story of tenacity, of perseverance, of determination.I knew next to nothing about the Dust Bowl before watching this, and I came away with a sense of not only the scope of the disaster and its history, but also a very real feeling for those who were there, those who saw it and felt it.Ken Burns does more than tell the story of what it was like during those dark years on the Great Plains of America, when dust and dirt tested the limits of human endurance for almost a decade. He makes those of us watching feel as though we were a part of it.

The heart of the presentation is the first-person narrative by survivors of the long ago nightmare who report on living conditions, loss of life, loss of property and the broken dreams of an entire generation of pioneers. Backing up the narration is a vast array of photos and film footage of the dust storms and their aftermath. Finally, the series describes the efforts by the Federal Government to identify the root-causes for the drought and so-called ""black blizzards"" so efforts could be made to bring the situation under control. At approximately 4 hours, the program is divided into 2 parts, with both being expanded upon by extras.

They report how in Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas, the promise of a new and better life brought thousands of pioneers to the new wheat growing region centered around Boise City in the Oklahoma panhandle. At first, things were good they say, and everyone made a fast-fortune growing bumper crops. Soon however, poor farming techniques and drought combined to bring about the ruin of everyone who lived in the region, epitomized by the blowing dust storms that came weekly and which lend the region its nick-name.The tragedy that turned a way of life into a road to ruin for a generation of pioneers in the 1930s is caught in action by the vast array of photos and movie clips presented in the series. There are photos of farmers having bumper crops at first. Later, the theme turns dark as the photos show the earth cracking under drought and crops withering. Finally, there are of course the dust storms themselves in all of their terrifying might.The final chapter of the tale is the reaction to the crisis by the Federal Government and the victims themselves. As farms failed year after year, lives and savings accounts were brought to ruin. Even as the government began teaching farmers improved methods of raising crops that slowly made things better, many people died and many others departed for the rumor of new opportunities in California. Finally the droughts ended and the exodus with it as the crisis came to a closure, but the region of the Dust Bowl was changed forever and America with it.The main feature of this show is nearly 4 hours long and presented in 1080i HD with good sound quality in 5.1 surround. It's divided into 2 discs with two hours each and packaged in a two-disc plastic case. Each disc also contains 3 extras apiece in the form of mini-documentaries and additional interviews with survivors. These expand on the content presented by adding additional depth and giving more information about some of the families whose members were interviewed for the series.I really enjoyed this documentary as it gives a very detailed look into the Dust Bowl tragedy. Having grown up in Oklahoma myself, I have personal experience with the human and environmental causes that led to nightmare conditions long ago as they are still realities today. These include too many people straining water resources, severe droughts and increasingly depleted water supplies. Seeing the human and environmental costs paid in those days should be a wake-up call for us in the here and now as global warming, drought and increasing populations stress our resources to the brink. This show is both a reminder of what happened before as well as a warning about what may happen again. I highly recommend it both for entertainment and educational use.",5,I Cried But It Was So Dry All I Got Was A Salt Stain,1361923200,"02 27, 2013",2013,3816,"['Ken', 'Burns', 'Dust', 'Bowl', 'documents', 'infamous', 'dusty', 'dry', 'days', 'drought', '1930s', 'way', 'sure', 'stir', 'up', 'worries', 'future', 'age', 'growing', 'global', 'warming', 'crisis', 'heart', 'presentation', 'first-person', 'narrative', 'survivors', 'long', 'ago', 'nightmare', 'who', 'report', 'living', 'conditions', 'loss', 'life', 'loss', 'property', 'broken', 'dreams', 'entire', 'generation', 'pioneers', 'Backing', 'up', 'narration', 'vast', 'array', 'photos', 'film', 'footage', 'dust', 'storms', 'aftermath', 'Finally', 'series', 'efforts', 'Federal', 'Government', 'identify', 'root-causes', 'drought', 'so-called', 'black', 'blizzards', 'efforts', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'bring', 'situation', 'control', 'approximately', '4', 'hours', 'program', 'divided', '2', 'parts', 'being', 'expanded', 'extras', 'documentary', 'very', 'good', 'look', 'light', 'today', 'growing', 'concerns', 'environment.The', 'human', 'toll', 'Dust', 'Bowl', 'tearfully', 'remembered', 'survivors', 'reminisce', 'youth', 'report', 'how', 'Colorado', 'Kansas', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Oklahoma', 'Texas', 'promise', 'new', 'better', 'life', 'brought', 'thousands', 'pioneers', 'new', 'wheat', 'growing', 'region', 'centered', 'Boise', 'City', 'Oklahoma', 'panhandle', 'first', 'things', 'were', 'good', 'say', 'everyone', 'made', 'fast-fortune', 'growing', 'bumper', 'crops', 'Soon', 'however', 'poor', 'farming', 'techniques', 'drought', 'combined', 'bring', 'about', 'ruin', 'everyone', 'who', 'lived', 'region', 'epitomized', 'blowing', 'dust', 'storms', 'came', 'weekly', 'lend', 'region', 'nick-name.The', 'tragedy', 'turned', 'way', 'life', 'road', 'ruin', 'generation', 'pioneers', '1930s', 'caught', 'action', 'vast', 'array', 'photos', 'movie', 'clips', 'presented', 'series', 'are', 'photos', 'farmers', 'having', 'bumper', 'crops', 'first', 'Later', 'theme', 'dark', 'photos', 'show', 'earth', 'cracking', 'drought', 'crops', 'withering', 'Finally', 'are', 'course', 'dust', 'terrifying', 'might.The', 'final', 'chapter', 'tale', 'reaction', 'crisis', 'Federal', 'Government', 'victims', 'farms', 'failed', 'year', 'year', 'lives', 'savings', 'accounts', 'were', 'brought', 'ruin', 'Even', 'government', 'began', 'teaching', 'farmers', 'improved', 'methods', 'raising', 'crops', 'slowly', 'made', 'things', 'better', 'many', 'people', 'died', 'many', 'others', 'departed', 'rumor', 'new', 'opportunities', 'California', 'Finally', 'droughts', 'ended', 'exodus', 'crisis', 'came', 'closure', 'region', 'Dust', 'Bowl', 'was', 'changed', 'forever', 'America', 'it.The', 'main', 'feature', 'show', 'nearly', '4', 'hours', 'long', 'presented', '1080i', 'HD', 'good', 'sound', 'quality', '5.1', 'surround', 'divided', '2', 'discs', 'two', 'hours', 'packaged', 'two-disc', 'plastic', 'case', 'disc', 'also', '3', 'extras', 'apiece', 'form', 'mini-documentaries', 'additional', 'interviews', 'survivors', 'expand', 'content', 'presented', 'adding', 'additional', 'depth', 'giving', 'more', 'information', 'families', 'members', 'were', 'interviewed', 'series.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'documentary', 'very', 'detailed', 'look', 'Dust', 'Bowl', 'tragedy', 'Having', 'grown', 'up', 'Oklahoma', 'have', 'personal', 'experience', 'human', 'environmental', 'causes', 'led', 'nightmare', 'conditions', 'long', 'ago', 'are', 'still', 'realities', 'today', 'include', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'straining', 'water', 'resources', 'severe', 'droughts', 'increasingly', 'depleted', 'water', 'supplies', 'Seeing', 'human', 'environmental', 'costs', 'paid', 'days', 'should', 'be', 'wake-up', 'call', 'here', 'now', 'global', 'warming', 'drought', 'increasing', 'populations', 'stress', 'resources', 'brink', 'show', 'reminder', 'what', 'happened', 'as', 'well', 'warning', 'what', 'may', 'happen', 'again', 'highly', 'recommend', 'entertainment', 'educational', 'use']",N/A

1539063,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B007VYEB44,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[90, 98]","What John Ford attempted (and, in my opinion, succeeded) to do in the 1940 feature film ""The Grapes of Wrath"" - to put a human face on those farmers and their families who survived the challenges of the deadly dust storms, as well as the Great Depression in the ""dust bowl quadrant"" during the 1930s - Ken Burns has succeeded with his latest four-hour documentary that aired on PBS in November 2012 and was released by PBS Home Video on Blu-ray with some bonus features. If you've seen Burns' documentaries on the Civil War or World War Two, you will have an idea of what to expect. Actor Peter Coyote is back as narrator and Burns chose specific families whose members are still alive to tell their own stories. When Burns planned the film he took out ads in the four-state area which comprised the ""dust bowl"" seeking survivors. He received over 70 responses and - through a process of elimination, chose more than two dozen to interview at great length. These were individuals who were children when the first storms came in 1933 (and lasted nearly a decade). A few interviewees were siblings. All make fascinating interviewees and their stories are compelling.The show aired on TV over two nights - two hours each - and the Bluray places each of the two hour episodes on a separate disc with related bonus material for each segment. In addition to about 20 minutes of ""deleted interviews"", there are a few ""featurettes"" hosted by Burns telling why, and how, he decided to cover this subject.While I found the production fascinating, after a while it began to become repetitive. Yes, the storms returned again and again but often Burns covered them from the same angle. Personally, I think the basic film could have been covered in two hours (with the extra footage as bonuses) to hold the audiences attention. But I still can recommend it.I'm a music journalist so the music used was of particular interest to me. For nearly all of the first of the two chapters the music playing in the background was traditional Appalachian folk music on the fiddle and guitar. Stephen Foster's ""Hard Times"" continued to reappear. The subject - if you recognized the title - was appropriate but the style seemed a bit out of place. When you hear the words ""Dust Bowl"" songs you think of Woody Guthrie (whose Centenary was celebrated this year). His series of Dust Bowl Ballads are well known. Burns introduced the first of two Guthrie recordings at the end of the second hour and uses one to open the third. Little is said about Guthrie other than the fact that he wrote the songs. I searched the long list of credits at the end of the film to see if the musicians were credited and there were none. Just a ""Music Editor"". Music has been a major part of most Burns projects like ""Prohibition"", ""Baseball"" and ""The War"" (not to mention ""Jazz"". The lack of credits surprised me - but probably won't affect most viewers.If you missed this show on PBS, I recommend the Bluray - or the DVD which, I think, has the same bonus features. It will also give you a chance to watch it over multiple sittings. I will say that, days after you have finished watching it, some of the interviewees faces and voices will still be with you!I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,"Bluray Review: Great story, Fabulous characters but a bit repetitive",1352678400,"11 12, 2012",2012,3301,"['What', 'John', 'Ford', 'attempted', 'opinion', 'succeeded', 'do', '1940', 'feature', 'film', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', 'put', 'human', 'face', 'farmers', 'families', 'who', 'survived', 'challenges', 'deadly', 'dust', 'storms', 'as', 'well', 'Great', 'Depression', 'dust', 'bowl', 'quadrant', '1930s', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'succeeded', 'latest', 'four-hour', 'documentary', 'aired', 'PBS', 'November', '2012', 'was', 'released', 'PBS', 'Home', 'Video', 'Blu-ray', 'bonus', 'features', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Burns', 'documentaries', 'Civil', 'War', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'will', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'Actor', 'Peter', 'Coyote', 'back', 'narrator', 'Burns', 'chose', 'specific', 'families', 'members', 'are', 'still', 'alive', 'tell', 'own', 'stories', 'When', 'Burns', 'planned', 'film', 'took', 'out', 'ads', 'four-state', 'area', 'comprised', 'dust', 'bowl', 'seeking', 'survivors', 'received', 'over', '70', 'responses', 'process', 'elimination', 'chose', 'more', 'two', 'dozen', 'interview', 'great', 'length', 'were', 'individuals', 'who', 'were', 'children', 'when', 'first', 'storms', 'came', '1933', 'lasted', 'nearly', 'decade', 'few', 'interviewees', 'were', 'siblings', 'make', 'fascinating', 'interviewees', 'stories', 'are', 'compelling.The', 'show', 'aired', 'TV', 'two', 'nights', 'two', 'hours', 'Bluray', 'two', 'hour', 'episodes', 'separate', 'disc', 'related', 'bonus', 'material', 'segment', 'addition', '20', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'interviews', 'are', 'few', 'featurettes', 'hosted', 'Burns', 'telling', 'why', 'how', 'decided', 'cover', 'subject.While', 'found', 'production', 'fascinating', 'began', 'become', 'repetitive', 'Yes', 'storms', 'returned', 'again', 'again', 'often', 'Burns', 'covered', 'same', 'angle', 'Personally', 'think', 'basic', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'covered', 'two', 'hours', 'extra', 'footage', 'bonuses', 'hold', 'audiences', 'attention', 'still', 'can', 'recommend', 'it.I', ""'m"", 'music', 'journalist', 'music', 'used', 'was', 'particular', 'interest', 'nearly', 'first', 'two', 'chapters', 'music', 'playing', 'background', 'was', 'traditional', 'Appalachian', 'folk', 'music', 'fiddle', 'guitar', 'Stephen', 'Foster', 'Hard', 'Times', 'continued', 'reappear', 'subject', 'recognized', 'title', 'was', 'appropriate', 'style', 'seemed', 'bit', 'place', 'When', 'hear', 'words', 'Dust', 'Bowl', 'songs', 'think', 'Woody', 'Guthrie', 'Centenary', 'was', 'celebrated', 'year', 'series', 'Dust', 'Bowl', 'Ballads', 'are', 'well', 'known', 'Burns', 'introduced', 'first', 'two', 'Guthrie', 'recordings', 'end', 'second', 'hour', 'one', 'open', 'third', 'Little', 'said', 'Guthrie', 'other', 'fact', 'wrote', 'songs', 'searched', 'long', 'list', 'credits', 'end', 'film', 'see', 'musicians', 'were', 'credited', 'were', 'none', 'Just', 'Music', 'Editor', 'Music', 'been', 'major', 'part', 'most', 'Burns', 'projects', 'Prohibition', 'Baseball', 'War', 'not', 'mention', 'Jazz', 'lack', 'credits', 'surprised', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'affect', 'most', 'viewers.If', 'missed', 'show', 'PBS', 'recommend', 'Bluray', 'DVD', 'think', 'same', 'bonus', 'features', 'will', 'also', 'give', 'chance', 'watch', 'over', 'multiple', 'sittings', 'will', 'say', 'days', 'have', 'finished', 'watching', 'interviewees', 'voices', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A

The Dust Bowl has Burns' special touch in a lot of ways, most notably in the way he makes it personal by including interviews with people who lived through it as children. Obviously the events surrounding the Dust Bowl were sufficiently horrific that they had no trouble recalling how it affected them and their families.  The photos and films give us a visual sense of what is was like and the images will stick with you.  But giving us stories of real people is what really takes you there and helps make this documentary what it is. It allows you to understand the relentless wind, dirt, sand... the death of children, livestock and the decimation of an entire way of life. Burns set the standard with his haunting music in The Civil War (especially with Ashokan Farewell) and I found that to be missing in The Dust Bowl. Also, while Peter Coyote does a good job narrating, I don't find his voice particularly appealing, but that is only my personal opinion and it certainly doesn't take away from the documentary or it's extraordinary impact.Not enough Americans are familiar with this epic occurrence in the 30s and the Dust Bowl is certainly a topic worth exploring and luckily for us, Ken Burns has given us an interesting, accurate and thought provoking way to do just that.The Dust Bowl, 4 stars and a hearty recommendation.",4,"The Dust Bowl - A Documentary About Dust, Dirt, Death and Despair",1376006400,"08 9, 2013",2013,1501,"['Ken', 'Burns', 'extraordinary', 'film', 'maker', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'learned', 'unparalleled', 'documentary', 'Civil', 'War', 'gave', '5', 'stars', 'highest', 'recommendation', 'Dust', 'Bowl', 'Burns', 'special', 'touch', 'lot', 'ways', 'most', 'notably', 'way', 'personal', 'including', 'interviews', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'through', 'children', 'Obviously', 'events', 'surrounding', 'Dust', 'Bowl', 'were', 'sufficiently', 'horrific', 'had', 'trouble', 'recalling', 'how', 'affected', 'families', 'photos', 'films', 'give', 'visual', 'sense', 'what', 'was', 'images', 'will', 'stick', 'giving', 'stories', 'real', 'people', 'what', 'really', 'helps', 'make', 'documentary', 'what', 'understand', 'relentless', 'wind', 'dirt', 'sand', 'death', 'children', 'livestock', 'decimation', 'entire', 'way', 'life', 'Burns', 'set', 'standard', 'haunting', 'music', 'Civil', 'War', 'especially', 'Ashokan', 'Farewell', 'found', 'be', 'missing', 'Dust', 'Bowl', 'Also', 'Peter', 'Coyote', 'good', 'job', 'narrating', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'voice', 'particularly', 'appealing', 'only', 'personal', 'opinion', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'documentary', 'extraordinary', 'impact.Not', 'enough', 'Americans', 'are', 'familiar', 'epic', 'occurrence', '30s', 'Dust', 'Bowl', 'certainly', 'topic', 'worth', 'exploring', 'luckily', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'given', 'interesting', 'accurate', 'thought', 'provoking', 'way', 'do', 'just', 'that.The', 'Dust', 'Bowl', '4', 'stars', 'hearty', 'recommendation']",N/A

Lowe ""Tennessee Tom""","[2, 2]","As in all cases where Ken Burns is producer, it was a SUPERB presentation of an event that many are completely &#34;in the dark&#34; about today. Considering the fact that there were no &#34;entitlement programs&#34; [ food stamps, welfare, etc] the people went to Kansas, OK., Nebraska,etc. in search of fulfilling their &#34;American Dream&#34; on their own. Regretfully, their &#34;dream&#34; turned into a &#34;nightmare&#34; due to drought and inappropriate over farming the land until the top soil was minimized. Many people died or returned East after 2-3 years of &#34;desolation&#34;, but ALL held on to &#34;hope&#34;. Mr. Burns choices of photos were most appropriate to reflect the suffering and disillusionment of the people but also the determination of the American people to confront adversity. Today, I personally feel, that people have become so dependent on the government to meet all their needs........they would not have the tenacity to endure such hardships. I would rate this documentary by Ken Burns a 5-star, because it stands alone. However, I feel guilty rating such a catastrophic event in our history higher than a 4+ star when so much death, destruction and &#34;broken&#34; dreams came at such a cost.",4,"""The Dust Bowl"" by Ken Burns",1362268800,"03 3, 2013",2013,1233,"['cases', 'where', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'producer', 'was', 'SUPERB', 'presentation', 'event', 'many', 'are', 'completely', '34', 'dark', '34', 'today', 'Considering', 'fact', 'were', '34', 'entitlement', 'programs', '34', '[', 'food', 'stamps', 'welfare', 'etc', 'people', 'went', 'Kansas', 'OK.', 'Nebraska', 'etc', 'search', 'fulfilling', '34', 'American', 'Dream', '34', 'own', 'Regretfully', '34', 'dream', '34', 'turned', '34', 'nightmare', '34', 'due', 'drought', 'inappropriate', 'farming', 'land', 'top', 'soil', 'was', 'minimized', 'Many', 'people', 'died', 'returned', 'East', '2-3', 'years', '34', 'desolation', '34', 'ALL', 'held', '34', 'hope', '34', 'Mr.', 'Burns', 'choices', 'photos', 'were', 'most', 'appropriate', 'reflect', 'suffering', 'disillusionment', 'people', 'also', 'determination', 'American', 'people', 'confront', 'adversity', 'Today', 'personally', 'feel', 'people', 'have', 'become', 'so', 'dependent', 'government', 'meet', 'needs', '..they', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'tenacity', 'endure', 'such', 'hardships', 'would', 'rate', 'documentary', 'Ken', 'Burns', '5-star', 'alone', 'However', 'feel', 'guilty', 'rating', 'catastrophic', 'event', 'history', 'higher', '4+', 'star', 'when', 'so', 'much', 'death', 'destruction', '34', 'broken', '34', 'dreams', 'came', 'cost']",N/A

It is a valuable visual record of a terrible social and ecological disaster, having the benefit of the recorded recollections of people who experienced the events first hand, albeit as young children. The series is probably 30% longer than its contents justify. It is also weak on explaining exactly what new agricultural methods contributed to the ending of the crisis (as opposed to a return to more normal levels of rainfall). Some things are mentioned - such as contour ploughing and returning farmland to native pasture, but this important aspect of the story is not given a sufficiently systematic treatment.
