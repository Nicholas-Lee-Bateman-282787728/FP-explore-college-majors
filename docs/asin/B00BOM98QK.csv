1636891,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B00BOM98QK,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[1, 1]","The beginning of OPEN ROAD is highly suggestive, with director Marco Garcia depicting different moments in Angie's (Camilla Belle's) life, as she works as a server, travels along a lonely road, and tries to communicate with her mother back in Brazil.  It's clear she's got something to hide, but we have no idea what; all we know is that she is a talented artist, who translates all her emotional pain into her paintings.  So far so good; but then the film experiences a failure of nerve and transforms itself into a familiar tale of self-discovery.  Angie meets nice boyfriend (Colin Egglesfield), and his skeptical cousin (Juliette Lewis), leaves her boyfriend in the lurch as she goes off on the road, and discovers at the end of the film that her friend Chuck (Andy Garcia) - whom she encountered at her lowest point during her journey - has a dark secret directly relating to her own life.  At times the script veers towards the banal, and although the film is well photographed, with several aerial shots of the rolling landscape with Angie's car just a speck on the horizon, one cannot help but feel that director Garcia could have done far more with the material.",2,"Good Beginning, But Eventually Peters Out",1392595200,"02 17, 2014",2014,1171,"['beginning', 'OPEN', 'ROAD', 'highly', 'suggestive', 'director', 'Marco', 'Garcia', 'depicting', 'different', 'moments', 'Angie', 'Camilla', 'Belle', 'life', 'server', 'travels', 'lonely', 'road', 'tries', 'communicate', 'mother', 'back', 'Brazil', 'clear', 'got', 'something', 'hide', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'know', 'talented', 'artist', 'who', 'emotional', 'pain', 'paintings', 'So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'then', 'film', 'failure', 'nerve', 'transforms', 'familiar', 'tale', 'self-discovery', 'Angie', 'nice', 'boyfriend', 'Colin', 'Egglesfield', 'skeptical', 'cousin', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'boyfriend', 'lurch', 'off', 'road', 'discovers', 'end', 'film', 'friend', 'Chuck', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'whom', 'encountered', 'lowest', 'point', 'journey', 'dark', 'secret', 'directly', 'relating', 'own', 'life', 'times', 'script', 'veers', 'towards', 'banal', 'film', 'well', 'photographed', 'several', 'aerial', 'shots', 'rolling', 'landscape', 'Angie', 'car', 'just', 'speck', 'horizon', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'director', 'Garcia', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'far', 'more', 'material']",N/A

1636897,A2GUPJMD2G0XMV,B00BOM98QK,Worldwalker1967,"[7, 7]","There are moments in life when we all feel the need to embark upon a quest. Sometimes we run from something, and sometimes we run toward the goal post. When that journey happens early, it can certainly provide the necessary backdrop for a coming-of-age tale.Even with top actors like Andy Garcia, Juliette Lewis and Camilla Belle, I didn't expect much from the Open Road and its $3 Million budget. But I am a father, and as such, the plot of a daughter taking to the road to track down an estranged father that abandoned the family... well, it resonated with me. So, while I knew this was a ""chick-flick,"" I welcomed the intensity break after having watched a spate of high-octane Sci-fi/Horror films.Overall, while the pacing was a tad slow, the ""Open Road"" was a feel good, family-friendly ride. Angie (played by the attractive Camilla Belle) is trying to deal with the emotional hurt from her father leaving, and needs to reconcile these events before her life can return to a more predictable path. The acting was solid, the cinematography was fine and the story was consistent, albeit a bit white-washed. The movie never depicts the harsh reality of living on the go without a roof over your head. Angie camps in the woods, sleeps in her car, stays pretty and paints - that's a fairly sanitized vision. The one haunting experience that she suffers through is presented to the viewer in piecemeal flashbacks with an outcome that is never quite shown - we are left wondering if she escaped or was forced to endure the encounter. This perhaps calls to mind a weakness in the film... the transitions leave a lot of questions, and deeper writing would have enhanced the offering. However, the chemistry between the characters was excellent at times (there is a young-love story), and the ending does elicit that old-fashioned Hollywood smile - even if this is an independent film studio.Parental Advisory - There is no nudity and the language is fine. However, the thoughtful plot and ""possible"" sexual attack leads me to suggest that PG-13 is the minimum. As for the entire movie... 3 out of 5 on my Indie scale.",3,Slow and Light... but an Okay Family-Friendly Coming of Age Film,1370563200,"06 7, 2013",2013,2113,"['are', 'moments', 'life', 'when', 'feel', 'need', 'embark', 'quest', 'Sometimes', 'run', 'something', 'sometimes', 'run', 'goal', 'post', 'When', 'journey', 'early', 'can', 'certainly', 'provide', 'necessary', 'backdrop', 'coming-of-age', 'tale.Even', 'top', 'actors', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'Camilla', 'Belle', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'Open', 'Road', '3', 'Million', 'budget', 'am', 'father', 'such', 'plot', 'daughter', 'taking', 'road', 'track', 'down', 'estranged', 'father', 'abandoned', 'family', 'well', 'resonated', 'So', 'knew', 'was', 'chick-flick', 'welcomed', 'intensity', 'break', 'having', 'watched', 'spate', 'high-octane', 'Sci-fi/Horror', 'films.Overall', 'pacing', 'was', 'tad', 'slow', 'Open', 'Road', 'was', 'feel', 'good', 'family-friendly', 'ride', 'Angie', 'played', 'attractive', 'Camilla', 'Belle', 'trying', 'deal', 'emotional', 'hurt', 'father', 'leaving', 'reconcile', 'events', 'life', 'can', 'return', 'more', 'predictable', 'path', 'acting', 'was', 'solid', 'cinematography', 'was', 'fine', 'story', 'was', 'consistent', 'bit', 'white-washed', 'movie', 'never', 'harsh', 'reality', 'living', 'go', 'roof', 'head', 'Angie', 'camps', 'woods', 'sleeps', 'car', 'pretty', 'paints', 'fairly', 'sanitized', 'vision', 'one', 'haunting', 'experience', 'presented', 'viewer', 'piecemeal', 'flashbacks', 'outcome', 'never', 'quite', 'shown', 'are', 'left', 'wondering', 'escaped', 'was', 'forced', 'endure', 'encounter', 'perhaps', 'mind', 'weakness', 'film', 'transitions', 'leave', 'lot', 'questions', 'deeper', 'writing', 'would', 'have', 'enhanced', 'offering', 'However', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'was', 'excellent', 'times', 'young-love', 'story', 'ending', 'elicit', 'old-fashioned', 'Hollywood', 'smile', 'even', 'independent', 'film', 'studio.Parental', 'Advisory', 'nudity', 'language', 'fine', 'However', 'thoughtful', 'plot', 'possible', 'sexual', 'attack', 'suggest', 'PG-13', 'minimum', 'entire', 'movie', '3', '5', 'Indie', 'scale']",N/A
