1205301,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B001J66JQI,Eric Sanberg,"[2, 2]","I saw another documentary (forget the name) about the Gerson method for treating (curing) cancer and it intrigued me. This one filled in some gaps and really drove the whole thing home for me.Here's the scoop. Documentary film maker Steve Kroschel leaves Alaska for the lower 48 to examine the claims of the late Dr. Gerson and his curing cancer (and some other diseases) using nutrition instead of pharmaceuticals. He interviews former cancer patients, nutritionists, doctors and the like and comes up with some surprising information.This is tackled on several fronts. First, Kroschel does a brief history on Gerson himself. Who he was. Where he came from. His curing of Albert Schweitzer's diabetes and so on. He then talks to patients to get testimonies on what their particular illness was and where they are today. He also speaks with doctors and nutritionists and this is where things get dicey. Most of the professionals interviewed dismiss Gerson out of hand even when they haven't read the findings or interviewed those who have been cured. And the reasons between them are surprisingly similar. 'They were mis-diagnosed and never had cancer to begin with.' 'Gerson was a quack.' 'The clinics take your money and send you away.' They begin to look rather silly after awhile. Part of it seems to be that the Gerson method can't be studied by the standard method of a double blind test used in the medical arena. Then there are the accusations that the cancer treatment industry is so large, the powers that be don't want to cure it at all. There's too much money in treating it. Particularly when the patients can cure themselves, once they know what to do, and wouldn't need drugs or radiation treatments.We've heard this story in other areas, where some something could be righted but the powers in place simply won't let that happen. I find it criminal that, with a better than 50% success rate, a U.S. cancer patient must go to Mexico or Hungary to get this treatment. His own country won't support him. I find it interesting that when Dr. Gerson was ready to publish his work, he fell ill and, upon his recovery, found his manuscript missing. He fired his secretary when he found she was stealing records from him. He re-assembles the manuscript only to fall ill again. This time he tests himself and finds he's been poisoned by arsenic. Seems even back then those in power knew his method would number their days.See this and pass it on to anyone you love that could benefit from it.",4,When Can We Take Our Lives Back,1376352000,"08 13, 2013",2013,2498,"['saw', 'documentary', 'forget', 'name', 'Gerson', 'method', 'treating', 'curing', 'cancer', 'intrigued', 'one', 'filled', 'gaps', 'really', 'drove', 'whole', 'thing', 'home', 'me.Here', 'scoop', 'Documentary', 'film', 'maker', 'Steve', 'Kroschel', 'Alaska', 'lower', '48', 'examine', 'claims', 'late', 'Dr.', 'Gerson', 'curing', 'cancer', 'other', 'diseases', 'using', 'nutrition', 'instead', 'pharmaceuticals', 'former', 'cancer', 'patients', 'nutritionists', 'doctors', 'like', 'up', 'surprising', 'information.This', 'tackled', 'several', 'fronts', 'First', 'Kroschel', 'brief', 'history', 'Gerson', 'Who', 'was', 'Where', 'came', 'curing', 'Albert', 'Schweitzer', 'diabetes', 'so', 'then', 'patients', 'get', 'testimonies', 'what', 'particular', 'illness', 'was', 'where', 'are', 'today', 'also', 'doctors', 'nutritionists', 'where', 'things', 'get', 'dicey', 'Most', 'professionals', 'interviewed', 'dismiss', 'Gerson', 'hand', 'even', 'when', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'findings', 'interviewed', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'cured', 'reasons', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'similar', ""'They"", 'were', 'mis-diagnosed', 'never', 'had', 'cancer', 'begin', ""'Gerson"", 'was', 'quack', ""'The"", 'clinics', 'take', 'money', 'send', 'away', 'begin', 'look', 'rather', 'silly', 'awhile', 'Part', 'be', 'Gerson', 'method', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'studied', 'standard', 'method', 'double', 'blind', 'test', 'used', 'medical', 'arena', 'Then', 'are', 'accusations', 'cancer', 'treatment', 'industry', 'so', 'large', 'powers', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'cure', 'too', 'much', 'money', 'treating', 'Particularly', 'when', 'patients', 'can', 'cure', 'once', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'would', ""n't"", 'need', 'drugs', 'radiation', 'treatments.We', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'story', 'other', 'areas', 'where', 'something', 'could', 'be', 'righted', 'powers', 'place', 'simply', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'happen', 'find', 'criminal', 'better', '50', '%', 'success', 'rate', 'U.S.', 'cancer', 'patient', 'must', 'go', 'Mexico', 'Hungary', 'get', 'treatment', 'own', 'country', 'wo', ""n't"", 'support', 'find', 'interesting', 'when', 'Dr.', 'Gerson', 'was', 'ready', 'publish', 'work', 'fell', 'ill', 'recovery', 'found', 'manuscript', 'missing', 'fired', 'secretary', 'when', 'found', 'was', 'stealing', 'records', 'manuscript', 'only', 'fall', 'ill', 'again', 'time', 'been', 'poisoned', 'arsenic', 'Seems', 'even', 'back', 'then', 'power', 'knew', 'method', 'would', 'number', 'days.See', 'pass', 'anyone', 'love', 'could', 'benefit']",N/A
