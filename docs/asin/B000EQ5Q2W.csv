976717,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B000EQ5Q2W,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[2, 2]","Fateless is based on the autobiography of Imre Kertesz, who was imprisoned in the Nazi concentration camps.  Kertesz wrote the book in 1975 and won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2002.Bringing this to the screen was a huge undertaking, and it shows.  Re-creation of the buildings of several camps was so real.  Through the eyes of the cinematographer, enormous wide angle shots were used.  Numerous shots of the massive operation were magnificent.  One got a sense of an entire scope of several buildings in various camps.  You could feel just how cold, wet, inhumane and dark this monumental tragedy was.The musical composition was perfect and moving.  In an interview with composer, Ennio Morricone, he said he did the music in three types.  One, was folksy child, and we can only relay that to the youth of the boy imprisioned.  The other type depicted loneliness, and the third type of music translated the human suffering.  The musical score was beautiful!!  You can't help notice it and how it set the mood.In 1944, a Budapest teen, Gyuri Koves' father is preparing for a forced labor camp.  Soon, Gyuri is taken for a bus and sent to three different concentration camps.This film is more graphic than some Halocaust films, and it is in the voice of a young boy, the eyes of a young boy and the inhumane suffering endured by a young boy.  He became gaunt, had blistered hands, starving, had an infected knee with maggots, and saw death at a magnitude no one should.  Then, it is upon his return home that he views his experience differently.The DVD features Making of Fateless, and an interview with the author.  It is one of the best depictions of the Halocaust.  ...Rizzo",5,A shocking ordeal through the eyes of a young man!,1182729600,"06 25, 2007",2007,1682,"['Fateless', 'based', 'autobiography', 'Imre', 'Kertesz', 'who', 'was', 'imprisoned', 'Nazi', 'concentration', 'camps', 'Kertesz', 'wrote', 'book', '1975', 'won', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'Literature', '2002.Bringing', 'screen', 'was', 'huge', 'undertaking', 'Re-creation', 'buildings', 'several', 'camps', 'was', 'so', 'real', 'eyes', 'cinematographer', 'enormous', 'wide', 'angle', 'shots', 'were', 'used', 'Numerous', 'shots', 'massive', 'operation', 'were', 'magnificent', 'One', 'got', 'sense', 'entire', 'scope', 'several', 'buildings', 'various', 'camps', 'could', 'feel', 'just', 'how', 'cold', 'wet', 'inhumane', 'dark', 'monumental', 'tragedy', 'was.The', 'musical', 'composition', 'was', 'perfect', 'moving', 'interview', 'composer', 'Ennio', 'Morricone', 'said', 'did', 'music', 'three', 'types', 'One', 'was', 'folksy', 'child', 'can', 'only', 'relay', 'youth', 'boy', 'imprisioned', 'other', 'type', 'depicted', 'loneliness', 'third', 'type', 'music', 'translated', 'human', 'suffering', 'musical', 'score', 'was', 'beautiful', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'how', 'set', 'mood.In', '1944', 'Budapest', 'teen', 'Gyuri', 'Koves', 'father', 'preparing', 'forced', 'labor', 'camp', 'Soon', 'Gyuri', 'taken', 'bus', 'sent', 'three', 'different', 'concentration', 'camps.This', 'film', 'more', 'graphic', 'Halocaust', 'films', 'voice', 'young', 'boy', 'eyes', 'young', 'boy', 'inhumane', 'suffering', 'endured', 'young', 'boy', 'became', 'gaunt', 'had', 'blistered', 'hands', 'starving', 'had', 'infected', 'knee', 'maggots', 'saw', 'death', 'magnitude', 'one', 'should', 'Then', 'return', 'home', 'experience', 'differently.The', 'DVD', 'Making', 'Fateless', 'interview', 'author', 'one', 'best', 'depictions', 'Halocaust', 'Rizzo']",Fateless

976719,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B000EQ5Q2W,Alex Udvary,"[11, 12]","Most stories dealing with the horrors of World War 2, do so mainly from the point of view of adults. Two of the greatest films to deal with this subject in recent years are Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" and Polanski's ""The Pianist"". But what makes ""Fateless"" different, is it is told from the eyes of a child. We tend to forget that children were also tortured during this time in history.Young Hungarian actor Marcell Nagy (in first big screen performance) plays Gyorgy Koves, a 14 year old boy from Budapest who is sent to a concentration camp after his father (Janos Ban) is also taken away. Now the boy must try to survive the horror he is about to go through.The film was based on Imre Kertesz's autobiographical novel, which he won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2002. And was directed by Lajos Koltai, who makes his directorial debut. Koltai though has worked as a cinematographer on another talented Hungarian filmmaker's work, Istvan Szabo. Koltai is shooting Szabo's most recent film ""Rokonok"" and has shot past films including ""Being Julia"", ""Sunshine"", and ""Mephisto"".For a first time director Koltai displays a wonderful visual eye, which I guess shouldn't come as much of a surprise from a cinematographer. But his ability at handling his actors and creating a solid pace really impressed me. He directs with a sure hand. I hope he makes more films in the future. This is also a rather ambitious attempt for a first time director. So a lot could have gone wrong for Koltai.""Fateless"" has moments that I found very disturbing. When you sit back for a moment a really think about what you are seeing and you realize that this is all true, it can give you chills. Lots of credit must be thrown Nagy's way. He displays an impressive emotional range for such a young actor. It's probably one of the best performances I've seen all year. It's sure to be better than anything Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise will do this year.Besides the film's strong emotional storyline, one has to notice the beautiful cinematography here by Gyula Pados, who shot ""Kontroll"", a Hungarian film which opened here last year. He also shot this year's ""Basic Instinct 2"". But I think his best work is here. He and Koltai managed to get such tender, embracive shots, that even though what we are seeing is sad, we can still appreciate the cinematography and its beauty.Strangely though the film has yet to find an audience. This film is every bit as good as ""Schindler's List"" or ""The Pianist"" and yet people have yet to hear about it. The film wasn't even nominated at last year's Oscars for ""Best Foreign Film"". And I doubt this year it will get any nominations. I hope I'm wrong about this, but, I hope people aren't staying away from this film because it's Hungarian. I know that's why the Academy has avoided it. They simply do not like to award Hungarian films, but, I didn't know the public would treat it as coldly too! I seriously urge everyone, please, please, please, seek this film out. Do not pay attention to nay sayers who tell you the film doesn't do anything new, it's all been done before. These remarks lead me to believe there is a prejudice against it because it's Hungarian. Please prove me wrong. This is one of the year's best films.Bottom-line: Lajos Koltai's directorial debut is one of the year's best films. A powerful, absorbing film that manages to touch your heart. Has many heartbreaking moments, and shows, as well as any film could, the horrors of WW2. Nagy is a born actor!",4,"Have faith in ""Fateless""",1155686400,"08 16, 2006",2006,3491,"['Most', 'stories', 'dealing', 'horrors', 'World', 'War', '2', 'do', 'so', 'mainly', 'point', 'view', 'adults', 'Two', 'greatest', 'films', 'deal', 'subject', 'recent', 'years', 'are', 'Spielberg', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Polanski', 'Pianist', 'what', 'Fateless', 'different', 'told', 'eyes', 'child', 'tend', 'forget', 'children', 'were', 'also', 'tortured', 'time', 'history.Young', 'Hungarian', 'actor', 'Marcell', 'Nagy', 'first', 'big', 'screen', 'performance', 'Gyorgy', 'Koves', '14', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'Budapest', 'who', 'sent', 'concentration', 'camp', 'father', 'Janos', 'Ban', 'also', 'taken', 'away', 'Now', 'boy', 'must', 'try', 'survive', 'horror', 'go', 'through.The', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'Imre', 'Kertesz', 'autobiographical', 'novel', 'won', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'Literature', '2002', 'was', 'directed', 'Lajos', 'Koltai', 'who', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Koltai', 'worked', 'cinematographer', 'talented', 'Hungarian', 'filmmaker', 'work', 'Istvan', 'Szabo', 'Koltai', 'shooting', 'Szabo', 'most', 'recent', 'film', 'Rokonok', 'shot', 'past', 'films', 'including', 'Being', 'Julia', 'Sunshine', 'Mephisto', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'Koltai', 'wonderful', 'visual', 'eye', 'guess', 'should', ""n't"", 'come', 'as', 'much', 'surprise', 'cinematographer', 'ability', 'handling', 'actors', 'creating', 'solid', 'pace', 'really', 'impressed', 'sure', 'hand', 'hope', 'more', 'films', 'future', 'also', 'rather', 'ambitious', 'attempt', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'lot', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'wrong', 'Koltai', 'Fateless', 'moments', 'found', 'very', 'disturbing', 'When', 'sit', 'back', 'moment', 'really', 'think', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'realize', 'true', 'can', 'give', 'chills', 'Lots', 'credit', 'must', 'be', 'thrown', 'Nagy', 'way', 'impressive', 'emotional', 'range', 'young', 'actor', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'sure', 'be', 'better', 'anything', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'will', 'do', 'film', 'strong', 'emotional', 'storyline', 'one', 'notice', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'here', 'Gyula', 'Pados', 'who', 'shot', 'Kontroll', 'Hungarian', 'film', 'opened', 'here', 'last', 'year', 'also', 'shot', 'year', 'Basic', 'Instinct', '2', 'think', 'best', 'work', 'here', 'Koltai', 'managed', 'get', 'such', 'tender', 'embracive', 'shots', 'even', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'sad', 'can', 'still', 'appreciate', 'cinematography', 'beauty.Strangely', 'film', 'yet', 'find', 'audience', 'film', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Pianist', 'yet', 'people', 'have', 'yet', 'hear', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'nominated', 'last', 'year', 'Oscars', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'doubt', 'year', 'will', 'get', 'nominations', 'hope', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'hope', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'staying', 'away', 'film', 'Hungarian', 'know', 'why', 'Academy', 'avoided', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'award', 'Hungarian', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'public', 'would', 'treat', 'coldly', 'too', 'seriously', 'everyone', 'please', 'please', 'please', 'seek', 'film', 'out', 'Do', 'not', 'pay', 'attention', 'nay', 'sayers', 'who', 'tell', 'film', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'new', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'remarks', 'lead', 'believe', 'prejudice', 'Hungarian', 'Please', 'wrong', 'one', 'year', 'best', 'films.Bottom-line', 'Lajos', 'Koltai', 'directorial', 'debut', 'one', 'year', 'best', 'films', 'powerful', 'absorbing', 'film', 'touch', 'heart', 'Has', 'many', 'heartbreaking', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'could', 'horrors', 'WW2', 'Nagy', 'born', 'actor']",Fateless

976721,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,B000EQ5Q2W,Christopher Culver,"[5, 5]","When several years ago I first read SORSTALANSAG (""Fatelessness""), the debut of Hungarian novelist Nobel laureate Imre Kertesz, I was struck by its unusual take on the Holocaust. Most stories about the concentration camps speak of how the human spirit can survive monstrous and hellish conditions, but Kertesz, a Holocaust survivor himself, suggests that to call the camps monstrous or hellish is to admit that the human spirit was in some way affected or oppressed by them after all. When I heard that a film was going to be made from the novel, with Kertesz himself penning the screenplay, my expectations were high. While I do prefer the novel to the film, I found the film quite moving indeed, and among its few faults one does not find, thanks to Kertesz's involvement, the usual ridiculous tropes of Hollywood adaptations.The novel was autobiographical, and the film is even more so. In 1944 young Gyorgy Koves (played by Marcell Nagy), part of a Budapest Jewish family, says goodbye to his father, called up for war labour. (Those who know Budapest will marvel at how well 1940s Budapest is reconstructed for the film.) Koves doesn't suspect that mere weeks later, he and several of his peers, and ultimately an enormous amount of their Jewish neighbours are sent off to Auschwitz. Koves survives the extermination camp, only to pass through Buchenwald and end up labouring in appalling conditions in Zeitz. The bulk of the story is Koves' experiences in the concentration camp, learning from a fellow Hungarian prisoner (Aron Dimeny) the need to keep one's chin up and take pleasure from the most trifling things in order to avoid the most fatal of emotions in the camp: despair. Director Lajos Koltai has long experience has a cinematographer, and here he impressively has concentration camp scenes shot in such a way that all colour is drained, and the entirely convincing set design is present here as well.While Kertesz' ending is just as shocking as in the book, the general theme of ordinary acceptance of one's circumstances is not as strongly pronounced through most of the film. This is probably due to the lack of first-person narration here, where Koves can speak at length about his feelings. Some of the scenes are stiched together very loosely in the film, so that at one moment the ill Koves suffers in a packed tent and at the next moment he finds himself in a fairly well-equipped officer's hospital with little explanation for the viewer. The liberation of the camp similarly comes suddenly here: after an extremely brief scene of Koves hearing gunfire in the distance at night, we immediately go to a sunny scene where people are walking around freely. New to the film is an exchange between Koves and an American soldier, impressively played by Daniel Craig who for better and worse is now better known as the new James Bond. Other changes from the novel, though not too objectionable, include the addition of a young love for Koves before he is sent off to the camps, and the absence of the social conflicts between Yiddish-speaking (""real"") Jews and the more assimilated Jews of Hungary, and between those who just want to get with their lives and those who naively plan of a new, more just Communist Hungary.Among films on the Holocaust, FATELESS is one of the very best. I'm very much appalled that it received such limited distribution, for as a film in itself, it is certainly a five-star affair. My comments and reservations on it are those of one who is keeping always the original novel in mind. If you don't care too much to read the book, see FATELESS anyway and ignore my points. I only wish that the one theme that made the novel so unique and punch-in-the-gut unexpected were more present here.",4,"A moving film, unequivocally worth seeing, though strays somewhat from the book's shocking point",1171929600,"02 20, 2007",2007,3736,"['When', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'first', 'read', 'SORSTALANSAG', 'Fatelessness', 'debut', 'Hungarian', 'novelist', 'Nobel', 'laureate', 'Imre', 'Kertesz', 'was', 'struck', 'unusual', 'take', 'Holocaust', 'Most', 'stories', 'concentration', 'camps', 'speak', 'how', 'human', 'spirit', 'can', 'survive', 'monstrous', 'hellish', 'conditions', 'Kertesz', 'Holocaust', 'survivor', 'call', 'camps', 'monstrous', 'hellish', 'admit', 'human', 'spirit', 'was', 'way', 'affected', 'oppressed', 'When', 'heard', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'made', 'novel', 'Kertesz', 'penning', 'screenplay', 'expectations', 'were', 'high', 'do', 'prefer', 'novel', 'film', 'found', 'film', 'quite', 'moving', 'indeed', 'few', 'faults', 'one', 'not', 'find', 'thanks', 'Kertesz', 'involvement', 'usual', 'ridiculous', 'tropes', 'Hollywood', 'adaptations.The', 'novel', 'was', 'autobiographical', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'so', '1944', 'young', 'Gyorgy', 'Koves', 'played', 'Marcell', 'Nagy', 'part', 'Budapest', 'Jewish', 'family', 'goodbye', 'father', 'called', 'up', 'war', 'labour', 'who', 'know', 'Budapest', 'will', 'marvel', 'how', 'well', '1940s', 'Budapest', 'reconstructed', 'film', ""n't"", 'suspect', 'mere', 'weeks', 'later', 'several', 'peers', 'ultimately', 'enormous', 'amount', 'Jewish', 'neighbours', 'are', 'sent', 'Auschwitz', 'extermination', 'camp', 'only', 'pass', 'Buchenwald', 'end', 'up', 'labouring', 'appalling', 'conditions', 'Zeitz', 'bulk', 'story', 'Koves', 'experiences', 'concentration', 'camp', 'learning', 'fellow', 'Hungarian', 'prisoner', 'Aron', 'Dimeny', 'need', 'keep', 'one', 'chin', 'up', 'take', 'pleasure', 'most', 'trifling', 'things', 'order', 'avoid', 'most', 'fatal', 'emotions', 'camp', 'despair', 'Director', 'Lajos', 'Koltai', 'long', 'experience', 'cinematographer', 'here', 'impressively', 'concentration', 'camp', 'scenes', 'shot', 'such', 'way', 'colour', 'drained', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'set', 'design', 'present', 'here', 'well.While', 'Kertesz', 'ending', 'just', 'as', 'shocking', 'book', 'general', 'theme', 'ordinary', 'acceptance', 'one', 'circumstances', 'not', 'strongly', 'pronounced', 'most', 'film', 'probably', 'due', 'lack', 'first-person', 'narration', 'here', 'where', 'Koves', 'can', 'speak', 'length', 'feelings', 'scenes', 'are', 'stiched', 'together', 'very', 'loosely', 'film', 'one', 'moment', 'ill', 'suffers', 'packed', 'tent', 'next', 'moment', 'fairly', 'well-equipped', 'officer', 'hospital', 'little', 'explanation', 'viewer', 'liberation', 'camp', 'similarly', 'suddenly', 'here', 'extremely', 'brief', 'scene', 'Koves', 'hearing', 'gunfire', 'distance', 'night', 'immediately', 'go', 'sunny', 'scene', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'walking', 'around', 'freely', 'New', 'film', 'exchange', 'Koves', 'American', 'soldier', 'impressively', 'played', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'who', 'better', 'worse', 'now', 'better', 'known', 'new', 'James', 'Bond', 'Other', 'changes', 'novel', 'not', 'too', 'objectionable', 'include', 'addition', 'young', 'love', 'Koves', 'sent', 'off', 'camps', 'absence', 'social', 'conflicts', 'Yiddish-speaking', 'real', 'Jews', 'more', 'assimilated', 'Jews', 'Hungary', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'get', 'lives', 'who', 'naively', 'plan', 'new', 'more', 'just', 'Communist', 'Hungary.Among', 'films', 'Holocaust', 'FATELESS', 'one', 'very', 'best', ""'m"", 'very', 'much', 'received', 'such', 'limited', 'distribution', 'film', 'certainly', 'five-star', 'affair', 'comments', 'reservations', 'are', 'one', 'who', 'keeping', 'always', 'original', 'novel', 'mind', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'too', 'much', 'read', 'book', 'see', 'FATELESS', 'anyway', 'ignore', 'points', 'only', 'wish', 'one', 'theme', 'made', 'novel', 'so', 'unique', 'punch-in-the-gut', 'unexpected', 'were', 'more', 'present', 'here']",Fateless
976722,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,B000EQ5Q2W,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[11, 12]","Marcell Nagy portrays the fourteen year old boy Gyorgy Koves in a very deeply emotional and haunting existential film about survival in several Nazi concentration camps. Marcell has large intelligent brown eyes that experience everything and absorb events. Marcell tells us his life story in a matter of fact distant voice, his feelings and thoughts are told in a stream of consciousness manner which makes the film even more penetrating and real to the viewer ... who experiences first hand the horrors of the worst atrocities associated with World War II.The film begins with Marcell going about his everyday life in Budapest, the son of an upper middle class family. He is carefree and planning his future until stories filter down about the horrors of the concentration camps. Family members gather, including great Aunts and Uncles to discuss the possibilities, even making small jokes  - planning but not yet realizing the full impact of such unspeakable tragedies on their lives. There is a partial denial of events until Jews are required to wear the yellow star of David on their jackets and many randomly disappear ... They are taken by train to camps in Germany. Gyorgy's father closes his shop, makes arrangements with a loyal employee to turn the business over to him with an understanding it is until the war is over. The viewer senses the hopelessness and finality when the keys are handed over. Gyorgy is put on a work detail at a factory, when he and a busload of young  workers are detained at a Gendarme police station ...Luckily, Gyorgy knew a few words of German when the prisoners were separated at the train station into groups. He over heard one line lead to a better camp and if someone was older they went on a work detail, young prisoners who could  not work wree not valued. This was the first of many random happenings where the right decision led to ... life ... or death. Gyorgy's fate hung in the balance. Throughout the film, different scenes  are totally unforgettable, they leave deep indelible impressions on the viewer, images are seared into the mind, branded, tattoed forever. When airplanes flew overhead, while everyone took shelter, Gyorgy was counting the number of seconds before a bomb exploded ... When Gyorgy and his friends were in the Gendarme's office, as each one met with the officer, he asked about their backgrounds and confiscated their belongings - the lack of compassion was so transparent and inhumane, the greed for a penknife was in such sharp contrast to the serious decisions made at the moment about so many lives.There were scenes in the camp when all the prisoners are lined up in the barbed wire prison yard, wearing striped uniforms and standing in the cold and the rain as punishement and also for roll call. Scenes where rocks were being shovelled and the cruel behavior of the prison guards toward the weaker prisoners made one shudder. Scenes where Gyorgy developed an infection in his leg, an abscess which turned out to have maggots in it. Scenes where Gyorgy was starving and hungry, as a corpulent German guard ate meat and bread from his lunch box while Gyorgy chewed along as if he were tasting the meal. Gyorgy developed a friendship with a fellow prisoner who was also from Budapest. This was a very heartwarming sincere friendship as each looked out for one  the other. His friend spoke with hope and love about the street where he lived and about returning in the future to his beloved apartment/home in Budapest. This one goal provided meaning to his existence in the camp ... In another heart-wrenching scene, two prisoners escaped and were hung as an exmaple to the rest.Lastly, the rescue scene is very memorable, where a kind genorous and efficient American soldier spoke with Gyorgy about his future plans, explaining to him, he could go to America, enter college and forget about all this, put it all behind him. The soldier could not understand why Gyorgy chose to return to Budapest ... When Gyorgy arrived in Budapest, everything about life there seemed surreal even when he travelled on buses. He saw the people lived and experienced nearly normal life, a few realized he was a Holocaust survivor, some looked at him with horror, others with a guilty fascination. A few dared to ask questions about his experiences, Gyorgy replied in a philosophical detached tone of voice. He was coming to grips with the realization of having lived through one of the worst tragedies ever in the history of mankind. His focus was to find his family, discover who had survived and reclaim his life while assimilating the completely inexplicable experiences of the concentration camp into his present and future in order to build a meaningful whole. This film is certainly one of the best Holocaust films made. It should be viewed by anyone wanting to understand the subject from a first person perspective. Another highly recommended film in a similar vein is about several generations of a Jewish family who owned a highly successful business, the film is ""Sunshine"" starring Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz.

976723,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000EQ5Q2W,Grady Harp,"[16, 16]","'Sorstalansag' (FATELESS) is an inordinately powerful, quiet journey through a year in Nazi Concentration Camps at Auschwitz, Buchenwald, and Zeitz.  Adapted by Imre Kertesz from his first novel, the story is semi-autobiographical as Kertesz spent a year of his youth in Auschwitz as a Hungarian Jew.  Though Kertesz alters his novel of the life of one Gyorgy Koves, in a manner he carefully explains in one of the featurettes accompanying this DVD, the observational skills and tenor of his literate mind suffuse this surprisingly quiet depiction of life in a death camp.We first meet Gyorgy Koves as a curly headed handsome 14-year old youth in 1944 bidding farewell to his beloved father as he departs for a labor camp.  Wearing the yellow star of David proudly, Gyorgy has little understanding of what it is to be a Jew, a lesson he will learn in the coming year and affect his perception of the world and his place in it.  Gyorgy's mother left his father and his father has remarried and requests that Gyorgy stay with his stepmother while he is away 'for a while' in the labor camp.  Gyorgy is conflicted as he loves his mother but he does as his father requests.  Almost inadvertently Gyorgy and his friends are taken off a bus and separated by the Nazis into trains bound for concentration camps.  Gyorgy remains relatively naive about what is happening: his head is shaved, his worldly goods are absconded, and he begins the hellish life of survival in Auschwitz.  Where Kertesz writes differently than other authors who have described Holocaust conditions is in his mindset of Gyorgy: Gyorgy strives to retain a sense of equilibrium in this bizarre new life, seeing certain events as probable errors, mistakes, or simply 'the way things are'. He endures starvation, brutal work, pain from an injured and infected knee, boredom, and observing sights of torture of his fellow prisoners.  Though he is walking in a stunned world, he is still able to fine the little moments of 'happiness' because of his youthful outlook and creative mind.  He gradually grows to understand what being a Jew means, and while he is unable to fathom all he sees in captivity, he learns that if he can't understand life in a concentration camp, how can he understand life outside either.  Gyorgy is literally on the carts moving toward the crematorium when the Allies free the camp.  He meets an American (Daniel Craig) who suggests he not return to Budapest, but go to America instead where he can pursue a new existence.  Yet Gyorgy's devotion to family, to country, and to being a Jew returns him to Budapest where he finds a destroyed city that had been home and wanders the town square trying to make sense of it all.As Gyorgy Koves, Marcell Nagy gives a stunning performance, a picture of a child/man who is forced to enter the world of adulthood via the horrors of Auschwitz.  Nagy captures the essence of the character with minimal dialogue and maximum use of his body language and eyes.  The supporting cast is superb, each creating vignettes in the few moments we see them that burn into our memory. The cinematography by Gyula Pados uses subdued color for the scenes outside the camps and a subtle sepia toned black and white or the scenes within the walls of the terrifyingly real buildings and yards of the camps.  The musical score by Ennio Morricone sustains the mood throughout.  But it is the director Lajos Koltai whose impeccable sensitivity to Kertesz' writing and vision that makes this long (140 minutes) film a seamless pondering of the passage of time - minute by minute, hour by hour, day by day, etc - that is the essence of Gyorgy's survival of a nightmare 'with little moments of happiness wherever they may happen'.  This is a magnificent film, by a gifted crew, and though it contains visuals that will crush your heart, it must be seen to be believed. In Hungarian and German and English with subtitles.

976724,A1JDYWBRIFPLGB,B000EQ5Q2W,"I. Jaime ""uthooked88""","[4, 4]","I would like to spend a few lines comparing Fateless to Schindler's List, but not until I describe Fateless first.  Fateless is a movie based on Imre Kertesz best-selling novel ""Fatelessness"" about his own experiences during the Holocaust in Hungary.  The film begins with our protagnist witnessing his father being called up to a ""labor camp.""  Later, on his way to work, he himself is grabbed by the SS and transported via rail to Auschwitz, the most evil of all the extermination camps.On his way, the protagonist encounters evil in many forms.  The SS that beat and degrade him and the rest of the Jews without regard for their humanity.  Later, in the concentration camps we notice the main characters demise and lost of interest in life.  Many of his fellow inmates struggle to get him to care about life and to have hope, but he is just merely to exhausted and disgusted with life to care at this point.At his most vulnerable point and on the cust of death, liberation comes and the protagonist is saved from a certain death.  He then return to Hungary to witness that many people have continued life as if nothing happened. To make matters worse, many of his fellow-countrymen and even his fellow Jews are indifferent to his suffering at best and disgusted by him at worst.  We notice that the protagonist is changed.  He has no hope.  He talks about his experiences and describes them as normal.  Not normal in the real world, but normal is his mind.The movie in itself is very powerful but it leaves you asking many questions.  It definitley doesn't provide you with a ""happily ever-after"" ending.  It is an awkward feeling to have a film with such violence and evil and suffering and not have any good come out of it.Feeling jipped out of a good ending, I went to the Special Features section and found an interview with Kertesz about the film.  Imre Kertesz not only wrote the novel ""Fatelesness,"" but he also wrote the script to the film ""Fateless.""  In a section of the interview, Kertesz expresses his disgust for the film Schindler's List.  He takes great exception to the ""happy"" ending portrayed in that film.  He argues that there wasn't always a silver lining to the suffering of the Jews.  In fact, there hardly was one.  The reality of the Holocaust was that there was a massive scale extermination and infliction of suffering with no purpose.  There was no greater cause.  No good that came out of it.  For example, in Schindler's List we see that ""Schindler Jews"" at the end of the movie and we feel a sense of relief, that there was some good that came out of all that suffering.  Also, we witness the Jews waving at Oskar Schindler in that movie and saying ""hi boss.""  Kertesz argues that this is just no factual.  Everyday life in extermination camps robbed you of your humanity.  The exhaustion, the lack of rational behavior, it all compounded and greatly affected the psyche of the Jews.  In Imre Kertesz' case, there was no good that came out of his suffering, so he didn't want to portray a film as such.  Therefore, you are left with a raw film with no hope.  Suffering and pain for the sake of suffering and pain.  It is very powerful and a must-see for everyone.

Bernabo,"[12, 13]","""Even beside the chimneys in the pause between the torments there was something similar to happiness.""""Sorstalansag"" (""Fateless"") is a different sort of film about the Holocaust.  It is based on the controversial novel by Imre Kertesz, a Jewish-Hungarian author and concentration camp survivor who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2002 ""for writing that upholds the fragile experience of the individual against the barbaric arbitrariness of history.""  ""Sorstalansag"" is Kertesz's best known book, and while the author has played down that the novel was autobiographical or quasi-autobiographical (Kertesz spent a year in Auschwitz whereas the central character of his book moves from camp to camp), apparently when he wrote the screenplay for this 2005 Hungarian film, he worked in more of his own experiences from the camps.Gyorgy Koves (Marcell Nagy) is fourteen years old and living with his well to do Jewish family in Budapest when he is put on a bus and ends up with other kids in a camp.  Somebody tells them to tell the Germans they are sixteen, because anybody younger is sent immediately to the gas chamber.  This is the first time that somebody does something that will help keep Gyorgy alive as he goes from camp to camp.  What is controversial about the story is the idea that Gyorgy finds not ""happiness,"" but what Kertesz describes as ""something similar to happiness.""  The relativity of the term is important, because this is a world where it is a good thing when the kid sharing your bunk dies and you get their food for a day or two before the guards discover you are sleeping next to a corpse.Director Lajos Koltai is a cinematographer who was nominated for an Oscar for ""Malena,"" but he lets Gyula Pados (""Kontroll"") shoot this picture and together they come up with something interesting visually.  ""Sorstalansag"" begins in color, but when we get to the camps the color is bled away so that it is black and white with tints of blue.  The film because almost poetic in its depiction of what happens, showing the piles of clothing by the empty box cars, the lines of prisoners forced to stand in straight lines throughout the night, or watching Gyorgy and other prisoner chase each other around in the mud.  Time and time again a scene ends before you expect to, and we recognize a sense of how the greatest horrors are around the corner.  It is not seeing escaped prisoners hung that the film privileges as horror, but a starving Gyorgy watching a corpulent German solider stuffing his face.For me the idea that a young boy would focus on what made him happy amidst the horrors of the camps is not farfetched.  Gyorgy is never going to forget, and if he chooses to remember the best moments rather than the worst, I am certainly not in a position to criticize him.  The point where I started questioning the narrative is when we get to a moment that first surprised me in ""Schindler's List,"" where we learn the shocking fact that there were actually showers in Auschwitz, and not just gas chambers dressed up as showers.  There were several points where I thought Gyorgy was dead, one after another, even though I expected him to survive the camps, so that challenged by credulity.  But then there was something that reminded me of Kertesz's agenda.  One minute it is the middle of the night and the Germans are ordering the crematoriums shut down.  The next it is the day and the camp has been liberated and there are American soldiers all over the place.  The moment of liberation is not part of the equation.  Nor, when Gyorgy returns to Budapest the moment of reconciliation with his mother.  Instead it is when he is questioned by a man on the trolley that Kertesz sets up the benediction of his film:""People only ask about the horrors.  Whereas I should talk about the happiness of the camps next time.  If they ask.  If they ask at all.  And if I don't forget myself.""",5,Imre Kertesz adapts his controversial Holocaust novel for the screen,1147219200,"05 10, 2006",2006,3899,"['Even', 'beside', 'chimneys', 'pause', 'torments', 'was', 'something', 'similar', 'happiness', 'Sorstalansag', 'Fateless', 'different', 'sort', 'film', 'Holocaust', 'based', 'controversial', 'novel', 'Imre', 'Kertesz', 'Jewish-Hungarian', 'author', 'concentration', 'camp', 'survivor', 'who', 'won', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'Literature', '2002', 'writing', 'fragile', 'experience', 'individual', 'barbaric', 'arbitrariness', 'history', 'Sorstalansag', 'Kertesz', 'best', 'known', 'book', 'author', 'played', 'down', 'novel', 'was', 'autobiographical', 'quasi-autobiographical', 'Kertesz', 'spent', 'year', 'Auschwitz', 'central', 'character', 'book', 'moves', 'camp', 'camp', 'apparently', 'when', 'wrote', 'screenplay', '2005', 'Hungarian', 'film', 'worked', 'more', 'own', 'experiences', 'camps.Gyorgy', 'Koves', 'Marcell', 'Nagy', 'fourteen', 'years', 'old', 'living', 'well', 'do', 'Jewish', 'family', 'Budapest', 'when', 'put', 'bus', 'up', 'other', 'kids', 'camp', 'Somebody', 'tell', 'Germans', 'are', 'sixteen', 'anybody', 'younger', 'sent', 'immediately', 'gas', 'chamber', 'first', 'time', 'somebody', 'something', 'will', 'help', 'keep', 'Gyorgy', 'alive', 'camp', 'camp', 'What', 'controversial', 'story', 'idea', 'Gyorgy', 'not', 'happiness', 'what', 'Kertesz', 'something', 'similar', 'happiness', 'relativity', 'term', 'important', 'world', 'where', 'good', 'thing', 'when', 'kid', 'sharing', 'bunk', 'dies', 'get', 'food', 'day', 'two', 'guards', 'are', 'sleeping', 'next', 'corpse.Director', 'Lajos', 'Koltai', 'cinematographer', 'who', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Malena', 'Gyula', 'Pados', 'Kontroll', 'shoot', 'picture', 'together', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'interesting', 'visually', 'Sorstalansag', 'color', 'when', 'get', 'camps', 'color', 'bled', 'away', 'black', 'white', 'tints', 'blue', 'film', 'almost', 'poetic', 'depiction', 'what', 'showing', 'piles', 'clothing', 'empty', 'box', 'cars', 'lines', 'prisoners', 'forced', 'stand', 'straight', 'lines', 'night', 'watching', 'Gyorgy', 'other', 'prisoner', 'chase', 'other', 'mud', 'Time', 'time', 'again', 'scene', 'expect', 'recognize', 'sense', 'how', 'greatest', 'horrors', 'are', 'corner', 'not', 'seeing', 'escaped', 'prisoners', 'hung', 'film', 'privileges', 'horror', 'starving', 'Gyorgy', 'watching', 'corpulent', 'German', 'solider', 'stuffing', 'face.For', 'idea', 'young', 'boy', 'would', 'focus', 'made', 'happy', 'horrors', 'camps', 'not', 'farfetched', 'Gyorgy', 'never', 'going', 'forget', 'remember', 'best', 'moments', 'rather', 'worst', 'am', 'certainly', 'not', 'position', 'criticize', 'point', 'where', 'started', 'questioning', 'narrative', 'when', 'get', 'moment', 'first', 'surprised', 'Schindler', 'List', 'where', 'learn', 'shocking', 'fact', 'were', 'actually', 'showers', 'Auschwitz', 'not', 'just', 'gas', 'chambers', 'dressed', 'up', 'showers', 'were', 'several', 'points', 'where', 'thought', 'Gyorgy', 'was', 'dead', 'one', 'even', 'expected', 'survive', 'camps', 'challenged', 'credulity', 'then', 'was', 'something', 'reminded', 'Kertesz', 'agenda', 'One', 'minute', 'middle', 'night', 'Germans', 'are', 'ordering', 'crematoriums', 'shut', 'down', 'next', 'day', 'camp', 'been', 'liberated', 'are', 'American', 'soldiers', 'place', 'moment', 'liberation', 'not', 'part', 'equation', 'when', 'Gyorgy', 'Budapest', 'moment', 'reconciliation', 'mother', 'Instead', 'when', 'questioned', 'man', 'trolley', 'Kertesz', 'up', 'benediction', 'film', 'People', 'only', 'ask', 'horrors', 'should', 'talk', 'happiness', 'camps', 'time', 'ask', 'ask', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget']",Fateless

Truth to be told, if his next films are like this one, I know that I want to watch them...The story is set in 1944, in Budapest. The main character is Gyorgy Koves (Marcell Nagy), a young Jewish boy that is separated from his family and sent to a concentration camp. He doesn't understand why being a Jew means that he cannot live in Hungary anymore, and he feels extremely sad and alone. Despite that, he manages to make new friends in the labor camp, and is even able to find fleeting but marvelous moments of beauty in the hostile environment he inhabits.I thought that it would be difficult to watch this film, and I wasn't wrong.

""Schindler's List"" and ""The Pianist"" have the reputations here, but ""Fateless"" goes far deeper than any fictional film I have ever seen in giving the audience the total, painful reality of what it must have been like to be a Holocaust victim. Gyurka (Marcell Nagy, a movingly natural young actor) is a 14-year-old Jewish boy in Budapest in 1944. One day, headed for work--his father has already been sent to a labor camp, so school is no longer an option--he is rounded up in a random sweep of the city's Jews and bundled off to a series of concentration camps. In the camps, he is beaten, humiliated and starved nearly to death, for no other reason than that he happened to be on the wrong bus at the wrong time. Liberated after a year of unimaginable suffering, he goes back home to neighbors who find his presence an unwelcome reminder of the recent unpleasantness. The story in ""Fateless"" is not what matters, but the sheer randomness of events in the camps, as Gyurka finds himself moved about like a pawn on a chessboard, among an ever-changing sea of faces. Suffering is the only constant, and Koltai--working from the brilliant screenplay by Holocaust survivor and Nobel Prize winner Imre Kertesz--gives us Gyurka's physical and mental anguish in bas-relief. Koltai films the story as a series of sharp vignettes, each ending in a fadeout as soon as it has made its point. ""Fateless"" is rigorous and austere in its rejection of scenes of outright violence; the most piercing scene shows Gyurka, starving and feverish in his bunk, remembering his stepmother's steaming cauldron of homemade soup. Framed by the heartbreaking score of master film composer Ennio Morricone, ""Fateless"" masterfully brings home the reality of the Holocaust. The DVD contains an interesting mini-documentary about the filming of ""Fateless"" (including some unintentionally funny English subtitles from the original Hungarian) as well as a riveting interview with Imre Kertesz, who explains why ""Schindler's List"" is unacceptable as a portrayal of the Holocaust. ""Spielberg depicts the Holocaust as some sort of victory for humanity,"" Kertesz says, ""but there was no victory with the Holocaust."" Indeed, at the end of ""Fateless,"" Gyurka can't get any triumph over his torturers, or even any sympathy from his neighbors. All he has is the ability to accept what has happened to him, without self-pity, and the courage to go on living. That is the whole point of ""Fateless""--and, one might say, of all human existence.",5,The most painfully real of all Holocaust films.,1180224000,"05 27, 2007",2007,2590,"['Lajos', 'Koltai', 'Fateless', 'far', 'more', 'fame', 'United', 'States', 'achieved', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Pianist', 'have', 'reputations', 'here', 'Fateless', 'far', 'deeper', 'fictional', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'giving', 'audience', 'total', 'painful', 'reality', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'be', 'Holocaust', 'victim', 'Gyurka', 'Marcell', 'Nagy', 'movingly', 'natural', 'young', 'actor', '14-year-old', 'Jewish', 'boy', 'Budapest', '1944', 'One', 'day', 'headed', 'work', 'father', 'already', 'been', 'sent', 'labor', 'camp', 'school', 'no', 'longer', 'option', 'rounded', 'up', 'random', 'sweep', 'city', 'Jews', 'bundled', 'off', 'series', 'concentration', 'camps', 'camps', 'beaten', 'humiliated', 'starved', 'nearly', 'death', 'other', 'reason', 'happened', 'be', 'wrong', 'bus', 'wrong', 'time', 'Liberated', 'year', 'unimaginable', 'suffering', 'back', 'home', 'neighbors', 'who', 'find', 'presence', 'unwelcome', 'reminder', 'recent', 'unpleasantness', 'story', 'Fateless', 'not', 'what', 'matters', 'sheer', 'randomness', 'events', 'camps', 'Gyurka', 'moved', 'about', 'pawn', 'chessboard', 'ever-changing', 'sea', 'Suffering', 'only', 'constant', 'Koltai', 'working', 'brilliant', 'screenplay', 'Holocaust', 'survivor', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'winner', 'Imre', 'Kertesz', 'Gyurka', 'physical', 'mental', 'anguish', 'bas-relief', 'Koltai', 'films', 'story', 'series', 'sharp', 'vignettes', 'ending', 'fadeout', 'as', 'soon', 'made', 'point', 'Fateless', 'rigorous', 'austere', 'rejection', 'scenes', 'outright', 'violence', 'most', 'piercing', 'scene', 'shows', 'Gyurka', 'starving', 'feverish', 'bunk', 'remembering', 'stepmother', 'steaming', 'cauldron', 'homemade', 'soup', 'Framed', 'heartbreaking', 'score', 'master', 'film', 'composer', 'Ennio', 'Morricone', 'Fateless', 'masterfully', 'home', 'reality', 'Holocaust', 'DVD', 'interesting', 'mini-documentary', 'filming', 'Fateless', 'including', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'English', 'subtitles', 'original', 'Hungarian', 'as', 'well', 'riveting', 'interview', 'Imre', 'Kertesz', 'who', 'why', 'Schindler', 'List', 'unacceptable', 'portrayal', 'Holocaust', 'Spielberg', 'Holocaust', 'sort', 'victory', 'humanity', 'Kertesz', 'was', 'victory', 'Holocaust', 'Indeed', 'end', 'Fateless', 'Gyurka', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'triumph', 'torturers', 'even', 'sympathy', 'neighbors', 'ability', 'accept', 'what', 'happened', 'self-pity', 'courage', 'go', 'living', 'whole', 'point', 'Fateless', 'one', 'might', 'say', 'human', 'existence']",Fateless

Deming ""Backyard Trees""","[7, 7]","In less than 2 hours, a viewer can feel the horror - and surprisingly - the few moments of deep unexpected joy - of the Holocaust. Hungarian director Lajos Koltai lowered us ""step-by-step"" from the luxurious beauty of 1944 Budapest through the slow descent of the round-up of the Jews, so slowly that the viewer, like the 15-year-old main character, never knew what hit us. Like the boy, we accept the Holocaust in all its terror and absurdity, aided by a magnificent sound score.Each scene is like a chapter in the original book, written by 2002 Nobelist Imre Kertesz, himself a Jewish Holocaust survivor. Avoiding cliches, the film focuses on realistic details: men and boys in striped uniforms made to stand for hours, their bodies sagging; the straw in the mattresses; the boy's swollen knee and empty eyes; the jocularity and cruelty among the prisoners; and the fate and luck involved in the hero's miraculous survival.I am not a fan of Spielberg's well-intentioned ""Schindler's List,"" which I found to be as inauthentic as most Hollywood films. ""Fateless,"" however, is authentic, creative and original in every detail. A massive $12 million budget rebuilt an Auschwitz in Hungary that was totally convincing. The somber sepia tones conveyed the dolor and pathos of the camps. Vivid color returns when the camp is liberated by Americans. Our young, forever changed hero, returns in a trance-like state to his ruined city.In the nature of true humanity, the boy refuses to be ruined.

Naegele,"[2, 2]","A riveting, beautifully filmed and scored-musically (by Ennio Morricone), Hungarian movie about survival and death in German concentration camps during World War II.  It is from a novel and screenplay by Imre Kert&eacute;sz, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2002 ""for writing that upholds the fragile experience of the individual against the barbaric arbitrariness of history.""It depicts in part how some Jews--for example, ""Capos""--abused their fellow Jews; and it follows one young boy (played by Marcell Nagy) from Budapest to Auschwitz, Buchenwald and Zeitz (where Kert&eacute;sz was a prisoner), and his return to Budapest at the end of the war.  There he is subjected to further travesties and indignities--Man's inhumanity to his fellow man, as Rabbi Harold S. Kushner has written.While I have watched many films about the Nazi Holocaust (and visited Dachau outside of Munich), this one may be the most powerful.  It is brilliant; and the director, Lajos Koltai, deserves enormous praise.  Obviously the Jews were persecuted; and human beings are wronged today in America and other countries of the world, where at the very least attempts are made to break the human spirit.  Those who were persecuted learn to persecute others, and often they do not think twice about doing it.  No guilt, nothing.  The film also depicts great kindness, compassion, generosity and love shown by some inmates to their fellow prisoners.""Everyone needs some life-giving obsession.  Something to keep their hope alive.""The words of one of the camp prisoners.  Perhaps our daily obsessions with winning and overcoming injustices, and reuniting with loved ones despite considerable odds, are what keep us going.

976733,A2GJ98824GGXGP,B000EQ5Q2W,Timothy Kearney,"[33, 35]","I recall reading Victor Frankl's MAN'S SEARCH FOR MEANING in college. If I'm not mistaken, I believe I read it for a number of different courses. It seemed to be required in history classes, philosophy and theology classes, and even an introductory class in psychology. Frankl's belief that the human spirit can triumph over the most overwhelming odds is a modern classic. As I watched FATELESS, I was reminded of this book, especially when an older prisoner took an interest in the young Gyorgy Koves (played by Marcell Nagy), the film's main character. Yet while the triumph of the human spirit over adversity can be found in this film, it's hardly a feel good flick. If anything, it's one of those films that will haunt and challenge viewers long after watching it.The film itself is based on Irme Kertesz's novel which tells the story of a community of Hungarian Jews near the end of World War II. In scenes that would be familiar to those who have read Elie Wiesel's NIGHT, the Jews of Budapest believed they'd be spared, or at least would not face the horrors that those who went to the camps earlier had to endure. Many discovered that this was hardly the case as people from Budapest began to be deported. We see the horrors of the camps as one would expect from such a film. We see the ways in which many prisoners took advantage of the situation while others tried to do their best to make sure as many people as possible survived. The camp is finally liberated and against the advice of the American liberators, Gyorgy returns home and it is then that we see how much the war and suffering changed this once effervescent young teen into someone who knew the truth about life.There are a number of reasons this film has such power. It has a strong story, it is filmed in a way that is appropriate for what is taking place, and a moving musical score by composer Ennio Morricone. While all these strengths make for a wonderful film, the point of view is perhaps the strongest element. We always see the action through the eyes of the young Gyorgy, and Marcell Nagy is such a gifted young actor, we feel as if we're moving through the film with him.FATELESS was not widely screened which is unfortunate. People missed the opportunity to see a powerful film on a wide screen where it has its full impact. Its release on DVD will ensure that many others will see it, and no doubt it will be counted among the most compelling accounts of the Holocaust in cinema.",5,A Film That Deserved a Wider Distribution,1148256000,"05 22, 2006",2006,2467,"['recall', 'reading', 'Victor', 'Frankl', 'MAN', 'SEARCH', 'FOR', 'MEANING', 'college', ""'m"", 'not', 'mistaken', 'believe', 'read', 'number', 'different', 'courses', 'seemed', 'be', 'required', 'history', 'classes', 'philosophy', 'theology', 'classes', 'even', 'introductory', 'class', 'psychology', 'Frankl', 'belief', 'human', 'spirit', 'can', 'triumph', 'most', 'overwhelming', 'odds', 'modern', 'classic', 'watched', 'FATELESS', 'was', 'reminded', 'book', 'especially', 'when', 'older', 'prisoner', 'took', 'interest', 'young', 'Gyorgy', 'Koves', 'played', 'Marcell', 'Nagy', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'triumph', 'human', 'spirit', 'adversity', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'film', 'hardly', 'feel', 'good', 'flick', 'anything', 'one', 'films', 'will', 'haunt', 'challenge', 'viewers', 'long', 'watching', 'it.The', 'film', 'based', 'Irme', 'Kertesz', 'novel', 'story', 'community', 'Hungarian', 'Jews', 'end', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'scenes', 'would', 'be', 'familiar', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'Elie', 'Wiesel', 'NIGHT', 'Jews', 'Budapest', 'believed', ""'d"", 'be', 'spared', 'least', 'would', 'not', 'face', 'horrors', 'who', 'went', 'camps', 'earlier', 'had', 'endure', 'Many', 'discovered', 'was', 'hardly', 'case', 'people', 'Budapest', 'began', 'be', 'deported', 'see', 'horrors', 'camps', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'such', 'film', 'see', 'ways', 'many', 'prisoners', 'took', 'advantage', 'situation', 'others', 'tried', 'do', 'best', 'make', 'sure', 'many', 'people', 'possible', 'survived', 'camp', 'finally', 'liberated', 'advice', 'American', 'liberators', 'Gyorgy', 'home', 'then', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'war', 'suffering', 'changed', 'once', 'effervescent', 'young', 'teen', 'someone', 'who', 'knew', 'truth', 'life.There', 'are', 'number', 'reasons', 'film', 'such', 'power', 'strong', 'story', 'filmed', 'way', 'appropriate', 'what', 'taking', 'place', 'moving', 'musical', 'score', 'composer', 'Ennio', 'Morricone', 'strengths', 'make', 'wonderful', 'film', 'point', 'view', 'perhaps', 'strongest', 'element', 'always', 'see', 'action', 'eyes', 'young', 'Gyorgy', 'Marcell', 'Nagy', 'such', 'gifted', 'young', 'actor', 'feel', ""'re"", 'moving', 'film', 'him.FATELESS', 'was', 'not', 'widely', 'screened', 'unfortunate', 'People', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'see', 'powerful', 'film', 'wide', 'screen', 'where', 'full', 'impact', 'release', 'DVD', 'will', 'ensure', 'many', 'others', 'will', 'see', 'doubt', 'will', 'be', 'counted', 'most', 'compelling', 'accounts', 'Holocaust', 'cinema']",Fateless
976734,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B000EQ5Q2W,Turfseer,"[0, 0]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***The Nazi program to exterminate the Jews was designed to proceed both quickly and slowly. The 'quick' approach was initially carried out by four special killing squads, the Einsatzgruppen, who operated in the occupied territories of the Soviet Union, following Germany's invasion of that country in June 1941. One of the most egregious of these killing squads' actions occurred in the city of Kiev over a two day period in late September 1941, where over 30,000 Jews were machine-gunned to death and buried in a ravine at Babi Yar. At a certain point, the Nazis decided that there was a more ""efficient"" way to conduct mass murder, so extermination camps were soon constructed and put into operation.The Jews who were not murdered right away were sent to concentration camps as forced laborers. This was the 'slow' approach, where these people were literally worked to death. Rather than exploiting the concentration camp inmates for economic gain, the Nazis and their minions often ran these camps merely for the sadistic pleasure of torturing their victims on a daily basis. It hardly would have been much 'fun' (in their eyes) to simply stick everybody in a gas chamber and have no one to lord over. 'Fateless' is the story of one such victim--Gy&ouml;rgy K&ouml;ves--based on Nobel Prize winner Imre Kert&eacute;sz's semi-autobiographical novel, which chronicled his own life as a teenage Holocaust survivor.There have been many films about the Holocaust, but I believe the ones that really work are those that are replete with a myriad of truthful details. 'Fateless' begins in Budapest, Hungary, with the 14 year old Gy&ouml;rgy returning home just as his father is about to be deported to a concentration camp as a forced laborer. Family members and neighbors are in attendance and each one is believably depicted, with distinctive personalities. Of particular interest is a former stockbroker (one of Gy&ouml;rgy's father's old friends) who erroneously believes that Jews are being used as 'bargaining chips' by the Germans. When one of the neighbors mentions extermination camps in Poland, the father's old friend emphatically states that this could never happen in Hungary and negotiations were already under way between the Germans and the Allies, which would lead to the end of the war and a successful outcome for the Jews. This wishful thinking was typical of most members of the Jewish communities during the Holocaust, and accounted for the lack of any attempt to escape before each victim was deported to the gas chambers.'Fateless' superbly conveys the escalating horror as the Hungarian Jews are rounded up and put on trains to Poland. In Gy&ouml;rgy's case, while on a bus on his way to a factory where he's been assigned to work, a policeman orders everyone off who's wearing a Yellow star. Thousands of Jews are marched through the streets and end up crammed into stables, where they're stripped of their valuables and then packed in to cattle cars on the way to Auschwitz. In a memorable scene, the Jews who are dying of thirst, beg a soldier for water as the train makes its last stop in Hungary. The soldier wants them to pay for the water and insists on getting paid first. The man in the train asks for the water first and the soldier curses them for being Jews and allows the train to leave, without giving them any water.When Gy&ouml;rgy arrives at Auschwitz, a man whispers to him that when he's asked how old he is, he should say sixteen. By posing as a sixteen year old, Gy&ouml;rgy saves himself from death in the gas chambers. A younger looking kid who's part of Gy&ouml;rgy's group, isn't so lucky. A German-speaking, Hungarian Jew believes that his work as an engineer will save him but when he attempts to negotiate with the SS officer, he ends up on the line headed for the crematorium. As it turns out, Gy&ouml;rgy only stays at Auschwitz for a few days; subsequently he spends time at Buchenwald and then is transferred to Zeitz, a provincial work camp.The bulk of 'Fateless' chronicles the various degradations the camp inmates suffer at the hands of their German overseers and local collaborators. Early on, a sadistic 'Kapo' (described as a Gypsy homosexual criminal by one of Gy&ouml;rgy's fellow inmates) punches Gy&ouml;rgy in the face for not following orders quickly enough. An older inmate, Bandi Citrom, a Hungarian Jew who's spent most of his prior incarceration in a work camp in Ukraine, takes Gy&ouml;rgy under his wing, and teaches him how to cultivate his ""self-esteem'. One practical technique he teaches Gy&ouml;rgy, is to ration his food every day, to maintain his strength. Not all of Gy&ouml;rgy's fellow prisoners are so altruistic including one Yiddish speaking Jew who maintains his own black market trade for sought after items in the camp.In addition to the paltry food provisions, the prisoners are often forced to stand for hours exposed to the elements. If they fall, they will be taken away and shot. In a harrowing scene, three recaptured escapees are hung in front of all the camp inmates while they again, stand for hours. Gy&ouml;rgy ends up back at Buchenwald and just before the camp's liberation, he almost dies after his knee becomes infected with maggots. Fortunately, he's brought to the camp infirmary where a Polish inmate helps him get better.The film continues with memorable scenes, which chronicles Gy&ouml;rgy's return to Budapest. To name a few, Daniel Craig's cameo as an American soldier counseling Gy&ouml;rgy, the exposure of a Hungarian who collaborated as a guard working for the SS and an indifferent train conductor who wishes to kick Gy&ouml;rgy off a street car because he doesn't have a ticket.'Fateless' ends on a hopeful note as Gy&ouml;rgy, a young man stripped of his youth, vows to move forward, subsuming feelings of hate. It's a film that's a must-see as the Holocaust must not be forgotten.",5,Superb Holocaust chronicle of Hungarian teen stripped of his youth,1403308800,"06 21, 2014",2014,5937,"['***', 'review', 'may',

This movie utilizes silence and a deathly blank stare like a sickle chopping down fresh wheat. You don't just see the holocaust through the eyes of this boy and others, but you actually taste and live it.  As the sequences fade in and out of one another you sense the accumulating loss of fate, hope and life.  The thin line between survival and death is made very real in this movie. A very well done movie about a very sad and scary time to be a child. And yet some children, though changed by the events, endured.

It tells the story of a young Hungarian Jew who gets sent off to the camps during the Holocaust, and his story is told in such a simple matter-of-fact way, yet the horrors of his experiences still has the power to affect us. The dialogue is in Hungarian, yet the translation is done exceptionally well, that we are able to really understand all of the protagonist's emotions as he goes through the horrors of the camps...the lead actor has done an admirable job in his role.
