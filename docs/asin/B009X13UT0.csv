1603026,A3OTSL449WSX64,B009X13UT0,"Michael E. Mitchell ""a Son of Lugosi""","[2, 7]","A group of vaguely-acquainted vermin (er, I mean stylish hipsters) that speak only in partial sentences and popular catch-phrases, and who have slept with each other during the course of the last several days (or hours) and had &#34;relationship difficulties&#34; congregate in a preposterously &#34;edgy&#34; club. Some of the lesser despicable characters have their feelings hurt (via text and other hip modes) by the more despicable characters. Two girls who have names, but no apparent souls, vacillate between ire,&#34;sorrow&#34;, abandon, vitriol, whining, and all the emotions they've heard about on facebook. One of the girls, the titular Alyce, is tempted to push her &#34;best friend&#34; off a roof; by the time that catharsis arrived, I was ready to look up the filmmakers and do the same thing to them.  A good path to pursue after such an act is to try becoming addicted to drugs bought from a human sewer (who actually seemed to be the most realistic and sympathetic character in the film).  Poor Alyce is distraught, and we, the audience, experience her dismay during the next eternity of minutes, as we agonize to her &#34;going really crazy&#34; in the confines of her mod apartment, and her whoremaster drugdealers pit of squalor. Oooh,she sure goes crazy, seeing visions of herself (or any of the other faceless characters, hard to say) with dead, white eyes, and other really &#34;spooky&#34; things that most kindergartners would assume is what you see when you are &#34;going off the rails on a crazy train&#34;(which she and her vapid dunce of a friend use as a ringtone, though I'm sure neither of them could identify the original artist, because this ringtone is some pop version of the song...no doubt meant to be a very wry wink at the audience).  These scenes were excruciating...excruciatingly dull.  I was hooked into watching someone's dvd(thank God I didn't spend a penny for the thrill of seeing this!) of this by the outright lies on the box (see for yourself, but don't believe them), including something like &#34;every gorehound's dream&#34;. By the time we get to see the gore, it was the last 12 minutes of film proper.  NOT that the inclusion of gore is a must for a movie to be good (or even acceptable), but if it was advertised as such, this climax left much to be desired.  At least one could hope that in her mad murder spree, Alyce would kill EVERYONE that had annoyed us so well in the rest of the movie, but no.  Her reasons for sparing some are evident, but why try to disguise this piece of crap as &#34;art&#34; by exercising some restraint in the end?  Yes, it IS gory, but there are plenty of other movies which employ gore in the CONTEXT of the story, rather than saving it up as a cataclysmic treat for the suffering audience.  There were a few admirable scenarios(the IDEA of the funeral; certainly not the way it was depicted, though), but always ruined by the rat-pigs that we were supposed to accept as characters.  SPOILER(for anyone who cares): after Alyce butchers a couple of vaguely human organisms, she returns home to find the police and her landlord (played by poor Tracy Walter) waiting in her living room and looking at her as she enters, all bloody and disheveled, carrying a murder weapon...we get a shot of her face, where she looks all &#34;defiant&#34; and &#34;empowered&#34; and says to them &#34;what?&#34; and then the jaded viewer can, to the second, cue the cut to black as the movie ends and the credits begin.Oh, I understand this was meant to be a fractured take on &#34;Alice in Wonderland&#34;, and even saw beneath the flashy, shallow surface to notice that it was an exploration of urban alienation and needless loneliness; big deal.  It was not a poorly made movie, but the reprehensible characters (who may be viewed as &#34;realistic&#34; by some), the awkward pacing, and the just plain ugliness of the entire thing made for one of the top three most annoying movies I've ever seen (it may even be THE most annoying).  I did not find it &#34;disturbing&#34;, &#34;fascinating&#34;, nor did it make my &#34;skin crawl&#34;, as advertised; the acclaimed &#34;critic&#34; from &#34;Ain't It Cool News&#34; recommends that if you get a chance to see it, do so...I imagine there are times when even he sees some movies when he's three sheets to the wind, too!If you really want to watch this for the gore, just skip to the last 15 minutes; and if you really want to see an innovative film about the themes this was probably intended to explore, either watch a Charlie Brown cartoon or &#34;Necromantik&#34;; both of which are more &#34;valid&#34; than this utter maggot vomit.

I mean, you look at the film from a technical and artistic standpoint and you know that there was obviously a lot of talent involved. However, by the end credits, you wonder why a cast and crew would want to waste that talent on a film like Alyce Kills.Alyce Kills is a horror film from The Collective and Bloody Disgusting. And, yes, it is bloody disgusting - so disgusting and vile that I toyed with the notion of cutting it off early. The plot is very simple, with awkward nods to Lewis Carroll's ""Alice in Wonderland"" sprinkled throughout. I can only assume that this device was used because the filmmakers thought that it was clever, and at times it works, but it would have been far more effective in a better horror film. As I said, the plot is very thin. It involves a young girl named Alyce who goes out one night with her best friend to party and get high. Her friend picks up some ecstasy at the club, and the two girls climb to the top of a building and start hallucinating. Alyce attempts to pull a prank on her friend, and accidentally pushes her off the top of the building. She takes a hard fall, but does not die. When Alyce is confronted by the police about the incident, she denies that she was involved. A few days later, the weight of the guilt becomes too much for Alyce, and she succumbs to a dark world of drugs and sex. She takes a dive into a nasty rabbit hole, and before you know it, she has lost her mind.This is all a set-up for scenes involving necrophilia and an extremely long - and unapologetically gratuitous - scene of dismemberment. There is also a random scene where Alyce masturbates to news footage on the War in Iraq, which will leave many viewers scratching their heads. Gorehounds are the intended audience for this film, and yes, they will get a kick out of it, but at the end of the day, that's all that the film has to offer - gore. The film doesn't even work on a ""so bad, it's good"" level.I didn't enjoy it at all. And that's sad, because this one could have been a lot of fun, not to mention that Jade Dornfeld is actually quite good as Alyce.",1,"Alyce Kills: Interesting premise, disappointing execution",1375142400,"07 30, 2013",2013,2179,"['now', 'again', 'come', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'wish', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'mean', 'look', 'film', 'technical', 'artistic', 'standpoint', 'know', 'was', 'obviously', 'lot', 'talent', 'involved', 'However', 'end', 'credits', 'wonder', 'why', 'cast', 'crew', 'would', 'want', 'waste', 'talent', 'film', 'Alyce', 'Kills.Alyce', 'Kills', 'horror', 'film', 'Collective', 'Bloody', 'Disgusting', 'yes', 'bloody', 'disgusting', 'so', 'disgusting', 'toyed', 'notion', 'cutting', 'off', 'early', 'plot', 'very', 'simple', 'awkward', 'nods', 'Lewis', 'Carroll', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'sprinkled', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'device', 'was', 'used', 'filmmakers', 'thought', 'was', 'clever', 'times', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'effective', 'better', 'horror', 'film', 'said', 'plot', 'very', 'thin', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Alyce', 'who', 'out', 'one', 'night', 'best', 'friend', 'party', 'get', 'high', 'friend', 'up', 'ecstasy', 'club', 'two', 'girls', 'climb', 'top', 'building', 'start', 'hallucinating', 'Alyce', 'pull', 'prank', 'friend', 'accidentally', 'off', 'top', 'building', 'hard', 'fall', 'not', 'die', 'When', 'Alyce', 'confronted', 'police', 'incident', 'was', 'involved', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'weight', 'guilt', 'too', 'much', 'Alyce', 'dark', 'world', 'drugs', 'sex', 'dive', 'nasty', 'rabbit', 'hole', 'know', 'lost', 'mind.This', 'set-up', 'scenes', 'involving', 'necrophilia', 'extremely', 'long', 'unapologetically', 'gratuitous', 'scene', 'dismemberment', 'also', 'random', 'scene', 'where', 'Alyce', 'news', 'footage', 'War', 'Iraq', 'will', 'leave', 'many', 'viewers', 'scratching', 'heads', 'Gorehounds', 'are', 'intended', 'audience', 'film', 'yes', 'will', 'get', 'kick', 'end', 'day', 'film', 'offer', 'gore', 'film', ""n't"", 'even', 'work', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'level.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'sad', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'fun', 'not', 'mention', 'Jade', 'Dornfeld', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'Alyce']",Alyce [Region B]
1603032,A3BT78P0UT2Z5F,B009X13UT0,The Brock Lesnar of Reviewing - The Most Hated,"[2, 3]","Meet Alyce, a young beauty with some troubling issues! I really didn't know what to expect so I had no pre-conceived notions about ""Alyce"", I dove in blindly. To my delight I was pleasantly surprised with how good a film this really was. The acting and production was good and Jade Dornfeld did a great job playing Alyce.After a night of heavy partying with her best friend, Alyce accidentally pushes her off the roof of her apartment complex. Thinking she's dead, Alyce lies to the police about what happened only to find out that her friend is still alive but in critical condition. As Alyce tries to figure out what to do next, her life begins to unravel as she spins out of control in a drug induced spiral. Her plan to fix things though is simple enough, murder and the best way to dispose of dead bodies.As I stated earlier, Jade Dornfeld did an excellent job playing Alyce, the ""single white female"" stalker she was referred to as in the film. She really had some major issues and I'm not to sure if she did push her best friend off the roof accidentally. She seemed fragile, innocent, truthful, dark, vengeful, crazy, and psycho all rolled into one amazing character you couldn't take your eyes off of. In the end ""Alyce"" turned out to be a gory type of revenge film in which the main character was obsessed with finding the best way to dispose of a dead body.The only thing I disliked was how it ended which seems to be a growing issue for me as of late. The gore and body dismemberment were excellent and the way she tries to get rid of the remains is classic! Jade Dornfeld again is one hell of an actor and has made a new fan out of me, again Bloody-Disgusting Selects has picked up a nice little gem of a film with ""Alyce"" and I would say is their top selection right along with ""Cold Fish (Bloody Disgusting Selects)"".

There are numerous hints to connect the two within the film including the song, ""White Rabbit"" which we hear early in the film.Alyce (Jade Dornfeld)  has work and rent issues. She opts to go party with her best friend Carroll, as in Lewis Carroll (Tamara Feldman). They are very similar...like Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.  Alyce is clearly the follower of the two as she was known as SWF. Their desire to party and do drugs escalates until the point of no return.Alyce descends further into the world of drugs and madness. At one point she swaps sex for ecstasy with a man who is symbolically the Mad Hatter.  Then the film goes over the top as the thriller turns into horror.This was an interesting film. At times the madness is shown as a weave of scenes of the present and future. The acting was especially good for a ""B"" film, although there were some scenes where I thought they could have done better on the dialogue.
