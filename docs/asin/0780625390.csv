34113,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,0780625390,D.P.,"[2, 2]","Thanks to a friend of mine finally cleaning out his garage, I was given a bunch of old VHS tapes including this one that was one of the many ""WCW Superstar Series"" that WCW started releasing around 1998 that ran around an hour long.  This VHS was different than most of the others they put out around this time as this was mostly just an interview with Goldberg about different elements of his character such as his signature moves, the entrance, the fans chanting his name, and memories of his WCW career up to that point with highlights being shown of them along with other ""in character"" comments from other WCW talents.  Highlights of his career include his debut match against Hugh Morris, the feud with fellow NFL alumni Steve McMichael, his war with the Flock & U.S. title victory over Raven, his 100th victory over Konnan, the night he went through both Scott Hall & Hollywood Hogan to win the WCW Championship, his first battle royal & confrontation with Giant, his first match against Sting on Nitro.At this point, Goldberg was only in WCW for around a year so they did a good job in covering that year on here as this was definitely when Goldberg was at the peak of his career.  To this day, this is a DVD that would still have value as none of the matches outside of the WCW Title win over Hogan has been released in full onto DVD so this is a tape that is worthy of being added to the collection.  As a side note, if you want an idea of just how unorganized WCW was at this time...the lead announcer at this time was Tony Schavone yet they spelled his name wrong while referring to Disco Inferno under the name ""Disco Fever.""",5,"The Debut Year Of ""The Man!""",1300060800,"03 14, 2011",2011,1638,"['Thanks', 'friend', 'mine', 'finally', 'cleaning', 'out', 'garage', 'was', 'given', 'bunch', 'old', 'VHS', 'including', 'one', 'was', 'one', 'many', 'WCW', 'Superstar', 'Series', 'WCW', 'started', 'releasing', 'around', '1998', 'ran', 'hour', 'long', 'VHS', 'was', 'different', 'most', 'others', 'put', 'out', 'time', 'was', 'mostly', 'just', 'interview', 'Goldberg', 'different', 'elements', 'character', 'such', 'signature', 'moves', 'entrance', 'fans', 'chanting', 'name', 'memories', 'WCW', 'career', 'up', 'point', 'highlights', 'being', 'shown', 'other', 'character', 'comments', 'other', 'WCW', 'talents', 'Highlights', 'career', 'include', 'debut', 'match', 'Hugh', 'Morris', 'feud', 'fellow', 'NFL', 'alumni', 'Steve', 'McMichael', 'war', 'Flock', 'U.S.', 'title', 'victory', 'Raven', '100th', 'victory', 'Konnan', 'night', 'went', 'Scott', 'Hall', 'Hollywood', 'Hogan', 'win', 'WCW', 'Championship', 'first', 'battle', 'royal', 'confrontation', 'Giant', 'first', 'match', 'Sting', 'Nitro.At', 'point', 'Goldberg', 'was', 'only', 'WCW', 'year', 'so', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'covering', 'year', 'here', 'was', 'definitely', 'when', 'Goldberg', 'was', 'peak', 'career', 'day', 'DVD', 'would', 'still', 'have', 'value', 'none', 'matches', 'WCW', 'Title', 'win', 'over', 'Hogan', 'been', 'released', 'full', 'DVD', 'tape', 'worthy', 'being', 'added', 'collection', 'side', 'note', 'want', 'idea', 'just', 'how', 'unorganized', 'WCW', 'was', 'time', 'lead', 'announcer', 'time', 'was', 'Tony', 'Schavone', 'yet', 'spelled', 'name', 'wrong', 'referring', 'Disco', 'Inferno', 'name', 'Disco', 'Fever']","Goldberg, Who's Next?

34117,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,0780625390,Mitch Weaver,"[6, 6]","In the ten years that I have been watching professional wrestling, I was always more of a WWE fan. However, there was one guy that made me want to tune into Nitro, and that was Goldberg. Goldberg has been a favorite wrestler of mine ever since he debuted back in September of 1997. He may not be the most technically sound wrestler of all time, but his strength and intensity are unmatched. He was the first wrestler I have ever seen to become so popular soley based on what he did in the ring. He did not have to come out and cut promo after promo like Austin and The Rock. He spoke through violence in the ring. Perhaps the most amazing thing about Goldberg, is the fact that he became the most popular man in wrestling in less than a year's time amassing a win-loss record of 176-0.Ever since Goldberg debuted in the WWE in March of 2003, the WWE have not released any videos or DVD's on him. He has captured the hearts of a lot of WWE fans, but some don't know the history behind Goldberg, or how he became such a huge star. If you were a fan of Goldberg's back in WCW, or you just started liking him in the WWE, this video is a must own. It takes you step by step through Goldberg's career from his debut in WCW, to after he won the title from Hulk Hogan. Goldberg comments on different aspects of his career through interviews, and a lot of different footage in shown as well.Overall, I thought this video was very well done, and extremely informative. It continues to be one of my favorite wrestling documentaries.
