If you're a fan of Boris Karloff, there's no question you must have this 2-disc set.  Karloff is not only the host, but appears in most of the episodes.  Comparisons to The Twilight Zone are inevitable; but the tone of the show more closely resembles Alfred Hitchcock Presents.  The quality of the scripts and acting varies wildly, making the series a mixed bag.  On the technical side, the picture looks crisp and clean, and the audio is acceptable for a mono recording.  A special bonus: 2 episodes of the equally obscure 13 DEMON STREET, hosted by a haggard Lon Chaney Jr.  Personally, I hope SWV will go ahead and release the full Chaney series.

Ten of the twelve episodes began and ended with Karloff standing in front of a roaring fireplace and inviting viewers to find out what lies &#34;behind the veil.&#34;Hailed by critics as &#34;the greatest television series never seen&#34; (according to DVD release publicity) The Veil was never broadcast. Troubles within the studio (and the collapse of a preliminary co-production arrangement with National Telefilm Associates) resulted in production being cancelled after only 10 episodes (an additional episode called &#34;Jack the Ripper&#34; had been produced by another studio and was acquired by the Roach Studios; Boris Karloff only introduces the episode). This was considered too few to justify sales to a network or to syndication. In the late 1960s, footage from several episodes was combined to make films that aired on late night television. Ten episodes were released to the public in their entirety for the first time in the 1990s and have subsequently been released on DVD by Something Weird Video. In 1999, &#34;Lifting the Veil of Mystery,&#34; a Tom Weaver article on the making of the series (complete with episode guide), appeared in issue #29 of &#34;Cult Movies&#34; magazine.I wish this collection was complete as for many years it was thought that only 10 episodes of The Veil were filmed and thus they appear here.

The Veil has actually made me a Karloff fan and feel it's a shame he was not in more visible dramatic film roles later in life.The Veil itself as mentioned on other reviews is indeed a lot like ONE STEP BEYOND, though the production values seem a bit higher and had better directing.  Each episode of The Veil has a feel more akin to a mini-movie due to its directing, cinematography and fine acting.Each episode, due to these high caliber production values, is very enjoyable to watch. Each story moves along at a fine pace and the music punctuates in just the right places, creating a enjoyably creepy atmosphere.  There are very few special effects and the ones present are pretty simple. I think this demonstrates how the power of suggestion can be far superior to getting hit over the head with special effects in order to put everything didactically on screen. Perfect examples of ruining or completely destroying a truly supernatural mood would be movies like THE HAUNTING (1999)and to a lesser extent the new movie 1408.I'd like to reiterate what others have said, that the prints are pristine.

668021,A2M1N8G4W4END8,B00005NG05,Michael R Gates,"[76, 76]","Although superficial similarities make it tempting to regard the Hal Roach Studios ten-episode series pilot THE VEIL as a sort of trial run for the later TV series THRILLER (a.k.a. BORIS KARLOFF'S THRILLER), that is really an inaccurate and unfair comparison.  It's true that both shows are hosted by venerable horror star Boris Karloff and that he appears in several of the dramatizations--in fact, he appears in all but one dramatization on THE VEIL--and it's also true that both series deal with the supernatural.  But unlike the stories presented on THRILLER--which are completely fictional horror stories, many based on previously published works by popular horror and science writers of the 1950s and early 1960s such as Robert E. Howard, Robert Bloch, August Derleth, Cornell Woolrich, and the like--the stories on THE VEIL are presented as &quot;true&quot; stories about real people who have had a brush with supernatural phenomenon like ghosts, reincarnation, psychic prognostication, and similar spooky irregularities.  But true or not, the stories on THE VEIL are, of course, purely dramatic &quot;reenactments&quot; with no scholarly research or backup information provided to the audience, and it is therefore more accurate to see THE VEIL as a precursor to the more contemporary THE X FILES rather than as a dress rehearsal for THRILLER.That said, THE VEIL is certainly an entertaining anomaly from television's golden era, and its high-quality production values makes one wonder why it wasn't picked up as a regular series.  In fact, the show per se was never broadcast.  However, in the late 1960s, 10 years or so after the original production, blocks of three or four episodes each were hastily stitched together--ironically, much like the Frankenstein monster character that originally made host Boris Karloff a star--and licensed to local TV stations for broadcast as movies on late-night TV.  So this two-disc DVD from Something Weird video is likely the first time THE VEIL has been made available to the general public in the show's original 10-episode format, and Karloff fans, horror fans, fans of THE X FILES, and, yes, even fans of THRILLER should find the show very enjoyable, and most will want to add it to their DVD collections.Whether due to restoration or just because the source material was rarely used, the picture and sound quality on the DVD set is just fantastic! The liner notes include a synopsis of each episode, as well as some interesting historical background material about the show.  Bonus materials on the discs themselves include a few episodes of 13 DEMON STREET, a foreign-produced TV show in the same vein as THE VEIL and from the same era.  That show was hosted by Lon Chaney, Jr., and the production quality is obviously not as high as that of THE VEIL.  Indeed, the source used for the DVD transfer is washed and sometimes jittery, but the episodes are, if nothing else, interesting for their historical value.This DVD set is a must-own for Karloff fans and for those who have a strong interest in or love for classic television.

Although the episodes offer a mixed bag of quality, at 25 minutes they move along quick enough to make even the mediocre stories tolerable.Unlike his 60s anthology series, ""Thriller,"" Karloff hosts AND stars in almost all the episodes. What is great about these shows is that they allow Karloff to play a wide variety of character roles. After watching a few shows you will come to realize what a superb actor he really was. With a few subtle changes of clothing and hairstyle he moves from character to character like a chameleon. From wheelchair bound invalid to gruff sea captain to kindly old Italian country doctor he is brilliant in every role.Something Weird Video has done a superb job of packaging this obscure series. In fact, the presentation here is better than many more famous TV series releases.
