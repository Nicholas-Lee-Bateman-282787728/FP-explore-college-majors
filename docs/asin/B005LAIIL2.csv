1488104,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B005LAIIL2,Chris Kennison,"[2, 7]","Nobody specializes in magic like Walt Disney does, and so ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" is right up their alley. It is the story of Cindy and Jim Green (Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton) who are unable to conceive. They are plagued by this and have reached a breaking point after trying and trying. So when they decide to put everything to rest one night by putting all their wishes and dreams of a child down on paper and burying it in a backyard, they wake up to a magical journey.""Timothy Green"" is a movie that will tug at your heartstrings as it explores what it takes to be parents with all the failures and successes. Even two parents with the best of intentions aren't perfect and make mistakes. Timothy Green didn't come into the world in the conventional way and CJ Adams does a great job portraying the newborn 10-year old's emotions and naivety.The early goings of the film are well crafted by the movie creators. They built up the story surrounding Timothy Green and you wonder just as everybody else what is next for the mysterious child. You wonder why there are vines coming from the child's ankles that cannot be removed. You feel the joy that the parents have long since sought and any parent who has had children, lost children, couldn't have children, or have been separated from their children for any length of time will be effected by the emotions.Yet, as the movie plays out, the storyline begins to feel a little predictable and not as mysterious anymore. Not to mention, some of the crafty storytelling that started off the film seems to fall by the way side as the story comes to a head. The final third of the movie seemed rushed and didn't even come close to capitalizing on the emotions that the audience was ready to feel. They brought us somewhere with really good tact and creativity but when we got there, they hit the gas pedal and rolled the credits. I could elaborate, but that would give away the movie.""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" is a nice little movie with really great intentions and I won't deny being effected by its message. I just wish it had spent a little more time exploring some of the emotions that they worked so hard throughout the film to develop.

""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" is a family film worth watching!From writer/director Peter Hedges (""Who's Eating Gilbert Grape"", ""Pieces of April"", ""Dan in Real Life"") and writer/actor Ahmet Zappa (""Pump Up the Volume"", ""Jack Frost"") comes the fantasy drama film ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" which stars Jennifer Garner (""Alias"", ""Daredevil"", ""13 Going on 30&#8243;), Joel Edgerton (""The Thing"", ""King Arthur"", ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"") and CJ Adams (""Dan in Real Life"").The film was released in theaters in August 2012 and earned over $50 million in the box office.VIDEO:""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" is presented in 1080p High Definition and presented in (1:85:1). The film features warm colors and for the most part, skintones look warm, blacks are deep.  I didn't notice any banding, artifacts or any problems during my viewing of the film.  For the most part, picture quality is very good.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:As for the audio, ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and English 2.0 DVS.  The film is pretty much dialogue-driven, with the exception of a storm scene where you will hear some surround activity and LFE.  But this is a film where dialogue is primary and sounds crystal clear on Blu-ray.  The musical score is also beautiful, composed by Geoff Zanelli (""Antz"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films"", ""Disturbia""), the music comes to life through this lossless soundtrack.Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" comes with the following special features:This is Family - (10:12) Featuring the cast and crew discussing ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"".The Gift of Music - (9:15) A behind-the-scenes look at the musical score of the song ""This Gift"".""This Gift"" Music Video performed by Glen Hansard - (4:43)Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by writer/director Peter Hedges.Deleted Scenes - (5:57) Featuring five deleted scenes with optional audio commentary by Peter Hedges.EXTRAS:""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" comes with both the Blu-ray and DVD version of the film.  A slipcover case is included.JUDGMENT CALL:""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" is one of those films where you just want to get lost in the fantasy world and just believe that special things can happen to a family.A film where you just don't want to over-analyze and just take things as they are.  No asking questions of how a boy can materialize from a box of notes planted in the back yard or how a child has leaves growing out of his legs, don't think too deeply about the fantasy elements.  Just enjoy this film for how a young boy is able to help a distraught couple, who are unable to have children but manage to have this one boy, Timothy, come into their lives and not only change their life but also touch the lives of others.I was touched by this film because as a father, I know how it was for me and my wife to try and have a child.  To think of how people around us had no problems but yet, each time we tried, things were not meant to be.  And just the emotions we had at the time, I can sympathize of the pain that both characters, Cindy and Jim are feeling.Both Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton did a fantastic job of playing the couple who suddenly have a new boy and experiencing all these new emotions of being parents.  Being a parent is an enjoyable but it can also be a frustrating experience (and many other emotions that one can easily feel), but for those wanting children, especially earlier on, you just have to adjust.  And it's interesting to see both characters grow in this short time with Timothy.Child actor CJ Adams also did a fine job of playing Timothy Green.  A character that is also trying to adjust to his new surrounding but also knows that his time is short.  And when you start seeing Timothy lose his leaves, you know that this happiness is going to be short-lived (so be prepared to shed some tears).But ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" is also about hope. Timothy touches the life of people in different ways and we get to see how he touches those lives throughout the film.As for the Blu-ray release, picture and audio quality are very good.  Warm colors and dialogue is crystal clear.  There are several special features included and because this is a family film, it will be released with both the Blu-ray and DVD versions of the film.Overall, ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" is a touching, enjoyable fantasy drama film that is best to watch and enjoy, without over-analyzing.  And for those who are trying to have a child or even planning to adopt, I definitely recommend watching this Blu-ray release as it is a fantasy family film full of heart, as well as full of hope.",4,"Beautiful, touching and a film that will no doubt, make you shed a few tears...",1354665600,"12 5, 2012",2012,4834,"['Beautiful', 'touching', 'film', 'will', 'doubt', 'make', 'shed', 'few',

My eyes rolled so many times I think I actually lost balance. However, at my wife's request we sat down and watched it on Blu-ray. I held on to the hope that this would be one of those films I ended up enjoying when the credits rolled at the end. It wasn't nearly as painful as I thought it would be. The movie still felt like it was missing something in the end, though.A happily married couple who long to start a family find out they are unable to have children. After they bury a wish list of what traits they would want their imaginary child ""Timothy"" to have, they awaken in the middle of the night to find a boy on their doorstep. As Timothy is introduced to the townspeople of Stanleyville, wonderful things begin happening that can only point to his arrival.Writer / director Peter Hedges constructed a touching film on the surface. It's only when you dig deeper into ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" that you get the feeling there should be more of a reason for the movie to exist. I found myself dreading the end because it was all too obvious how it was going to pan out. The conclusion left both my wife and I with a sensation of dissatisfaction. This is what I would call a ""feel good"" movie that doesn't leave you feeling so great.The high-definition transfer for the Blu-ray version of the movie looks and sounds wonderful. All the beautiful colors of fall jump out of the screen at viewers. The 5.1 surround sound mix delivers a great balance of dialogue, musical score, and sound effects. You feel immersed in rustling leaves, crashing thunder, raindrops, and other sounds of nature throughout.Bonus material for the Blu-ray edition includes audio commentary by director / writer Peter Hedges. There are also two featurettes entitled ""This is Family"" and ""The Gift of Music."" We also get five deleted scenes with optional commentary from Peter Hedges. A music video for ""This Gift,"" performed by Glen Hansard, Marketa Irglova and the Brooklyn Youth Chorus, is featured as well.""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" tries very hard to give viewers an emotional and entertaining experience. An unsatisfying finale is likely to ruin it for most audiences.

This movie is about a couple (Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton) that want a child but can't have one. One night they buried a box that had all of the things that they want their child to be like. Later that night a boy named Timothy (C.J. Adams) comes out of the garden and changes the couples life forever.My favorite part of the movie was at the end when a little girl from the adoption center comes running up to the couple and when walking into their house she is holding there hand and they are so happy to have a real child -forever! I feel like they are meant to have a kid by the way they treat Timothy the minute they see him.Jennifer Garner, in this film plays Cindy Green. She is a very nice lady and is very loving to Timothy. She is a motherly person and you can tell she is meant to be a mother. Joel Edgerton, plays Jim Green in this movie. He is also very loving and really wants a kid. He would be a person who helps their child go through hard times and shows them how to deal with it.CJ Adams plays a really important part in this movie as Timothy. Timothy is a great fun loving kid who loves meeting people.  I admire how he is not afraid of anything. I would give The Odd Life of Timothy Green 5 out of 5 stars - it was so good!The movie will make you laugh, cry and feel all happy inside. I would recommend ages 10 all the way to and adult because this isn't just for kids it is for anyone! You will find adults and kids in the theater, so the ages are all over the place. Even teens will like this movie! Find this movie at a theater near you on august 15, 2012. Julia C, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.The main story of this movie is about love, and I love this movie and can't wait to watch it again. Joel Edgerton and Jennifer Garner play Mr. and Mrs. Green who is trying to have a baby. However, their doctor tells them there is no hope. They are so sad and wanted to move on with their lives. They name their little boy Timothy, then they listed characters that Timothy would have in pieces of paper then put it in a box and bury it so they can go on with their lives. A magical thing happened, Timothy came from the garden where they buried him. Timothy Green play by CJ Adams, is a great actor.  His love for everyone is unconditional. I can see all his emotions through his eyes and his facial expression.This movie emotion is like riding a roller coaster.  I am laughing and crying on the same scene. The cinematographer and production designer are awesome. The details of the town and the pencil factory are so real. The colors of the fall leaves are so vibrant. They really capture the small town America. Dianne West play a grumpy old woman is so funny with her chin hair. My favorite character is Timothy.
