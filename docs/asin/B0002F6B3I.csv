It's film about a young woman (the lovely Marlyne Afflack) who meets a man and learns that he has an issue.  It depict's scenes where Harpers character cannot perform for a real woman but can get it up for his films.  You really get to see how much his life is affected by it when he sees an attractive woman pass by and automatically goes to 'rewind' her passing by again. The beginning is somewhat immature but it gets better as the film progresses.  Good laughs and some good diaglogue into how the 2 main characters deal with eachother. The supporting characters also do a great job as well as the subject matter outside of the 2 main characters. You also get to witness some Jamaican culture as seen with some characters and the dancehall club scene.,4,Rent it,1189814400,"09 15, 2007",2007,873,"['Great', 'film', 'topic', 'not', 'explored', 'enough', '.porn', 'addiciton', 'Now', 'not', 'heavy', 'subject', 'just', 'enough', 'film', 'young', 'woman', 'lovely', 'Marlyne', 'Afflack', 'who', 'man', 'issue', 'depict', 'scenes', 'where', 'Harpers', 'character', 'can', 'not', 'perform', 'real', 'woman', 'can', 'get', 'up', 'films', 'really', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'life', 'affected', 'when', 'attractive', 'woman', 'pass', 'automatically', ""'rewind"", 'passing', 'again', 'beginning', 'somewhat', 'immature', 'better', 'film', 'Good', 'laughs', 'good', 'diaglogue', 'how', '2', 'main', 'characters', 'deal', 'eachother', 'supporting', 'characters', 'also', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'subject', 'matter', '2', 'main', 'characters', 'also', 'get', 'witness', 'Jamaican', 'culture', 'seen', 'characters', 'dancehall', 'club', 'scene']","Love, Sex & Eating The Bones"

832622,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0002F6B3I,Roland E. Zwick,"[54, 55]","***1/2The provocatively titled ""Love, Sex and Eating the Bones"" is a tale about sexual frustration involving a man addicted to porn and a woman with a decidedly more conservative view of making love.  The curious twist is that it is the woman who wants to get down-and-dirty in the sack and the man who finds himself unable to rise to the occasion.Michael is an aspiring photographer who works as a security guard at a local parking garage.  Jasmine is a successful ad agency executive who has sworn off both men and sex since her last abortive relationship two years ago.  The two find themselves falling in love with one another but hit a rocky patch when Michael turns out to be impotent - at least when it comes to having to perform with a flesh-and-blood human being.""Love, Sex and Eating the Bones"" starts off as a sub-par, utterly conventional romantic comedy, but just when you're about to give up on it, it takes a daring and much appreciated detour into some previously unexplored territory.  This is the first film I can remember to feature impotence as a major plot point and the first to acknowledge the detrimental effect that pornography can have on real-world relationships.  That the film does so in the context of a romantic comedy in no way diminishes its value and, in fact, makes the topics more palatable and approachable than they might otherwise be.  Moreover, the film is blessed with two extremely likable stars as its protagonists, Hill Harper and Marlyne Afflack, who tackle the tricky subject matter with charm and grace.  Some may see the humor in the film as vulgar and crude at times, but I tend to think of it as realistic, accurately capturing the ways in which couples talk and deal with one another in the modern world.  This turns out to be a better film than one might initially suspect.",3,offbeat romantic comedy,1109289600,"02 25, 2005",2005,1825,"['***1/2The', 'provocatively', 'titled', 'Love', 'Sex', 'Eating', 'Bones', 'tale', 'sexual', 'frustration', 'involving', 'man', 'addicted', 'porn', 'woman', 'decidedly', 'more', 'conservative', 'view', 'making', 'love', 'curious', 'twist', 'woman', 'who', 'get', 'down-and-dirty', 'sack', 'man', 'who', 'unable', 'rise', 'occasion.Michael', 'aspiring', 'photographer', 'who', 'security', 'guard', 'local', 'parking', 'garage', 'Jasmine', 'successful', 'ad', 'agency', 'executive', 'who', 'sworn', 'off', 'men', 'sex', 'last', 'abortive', 'relationship', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'two', 'find', 'falling', 'love', 'one', 'hit', 'rocky', 'patch', 'when', 'Michael', 'out', 'be', 'impotent', 'least', 'when', 'having', 'perform', 'flesh-and-blood', 'human', 'being', 'Love', 'Sex', 'Eating', 'Bones', 'off', 'sub-par', 'utterly', 'conventional', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'just', 'when', ""'re"", 'give', 'up', 'daring', 'much', 'appreciated', 'detour', 'previously', 'unexplored', 'territory', 'first', 'film', 'can', 'remember', 'feature', 'impotence', 'major', 'plot', 'point', 'first', 'acknowledge', 'detrimental', 'effect', 'pornography', 'can', 'have', 'real-world', 'relationships', 'film', 'so', 'context', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'way', 'value', 'fact', 'topics', 'more', 'palatable', 'approachable', 'might', 'otherwise', 'be', 'Moreover', 'film', 'blessed', 'two', 'extremely', 'likable', 'stars', 'protagonists', 'Hill', 'Harper', 'Marlyne', 'Afflack', 'who', 'tackle', 'tricky', 'subject', 'matter', 'charm', 'grace', 'may', 'see', 'humor', 'film', 'vulgar', 'crude', 'times', 'tend', 'think', 'realistic', 'accurately', 'capturing', 'ways', 'couples', 'talk', 'deal', 'one', 'modern', 'world', 'out', 'be', 'better', 'film', 'one', 'might', 'initially', 'suspect']","Love, Sex & Eating The Bones"

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[0, 2]","If the main male star had been anybody but Hill Harper, I'd have turned the movie off after five minutes. But he sent a retweet about somebody watching the film, I'd never heard of it so I checked it out for free on Netflix. This had to be the most awkward movie I've ever seen in my life.Maybe the problem is I look at Hill Harper as this sexy, classy, professional guy so it was hard to picture him as this wild-haired, frustrated artist with a pornography addiction. He meets a woman who he really likes and after she goes from being celibate to wanting to give it up, he can't stand at attention. The problem is he can always ""rise"" to the occasion when porno is involved. She's offended. He's frustrated. Both of them are sexually frustrated, and their friends are there to either instigate or crack jokes.Jasmine's friend was annoying. She had an attitude for no apparent reason and was forever in their business, so basically she was the stereotypical girlfriend. Michael (Hill Harper's character)'s friends were hilarious, especially the gorgeous guy with the Jamaican accent. I don't know if he's been in any other movies, but he should be on somebody's billboard promoting cologne or underwear or something. Funny thing is his purpose in the movie was to be anything but sexy. He was pushy, funny and trifling, but I was entertained during every one of his scenes. I fell out laughing when he told Jasmine's friend, ""You're almost as sweet as me."" The ""hope it's not contagious"" line was funny, too.So was the movie good? Not really. I would never want to watch it again, but it was kinda like watching a horror flick. I was too wrapped up to not look away but cringed the whole time. This movie seemed more Jamie Foxx than Hill Harper, or maybe I'm just trying to make the guy more sophisticated than he really is. Then again a movie about anybody addicted to porn in a comedy isn't really that thought-provoking. The ending was predictable. The guy with the truck and the braids who thought a certain person had a gun was a terrible actor.Would I recommend the movie? If you like slapstick comedy, this is for you. If goofy comedies aren't your thing, probably not.",2,One hundred minutes of awkward,1282867200,"08 27, 2010",2010,2177,"['main', 'male', 'star', 'had', 'been', 'anybody', 'Hill', 'Harper', ""'d"", 'have', 'turned', 'movie', 'five', 'minutes', 'sent', 'retweet', 'somebody', 'watching', 'film', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'checked', 'out', 'free', 'Netflix', 'had', 'be', 'most', 'awkward', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'life.Maybe', 'problem', 'look', 'Hill', 'Harper', 'sexy', 'classy', 'professional', 'guy', 'was', 'hard', 'picture', 'wild-haired', 'frustrated', 'artist', 'pornography', 'addiction', 'woman', 'who', 'really', 'being', 'celibate', 'wanting', 'give', 'up', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'attention', 'problem', 'can', 'always', 'rise', 'occasion', 'when', 'porno', 'involved', 'offended', 'frustrated', 'are', 'sexually', 'frustrated', 'friends', 'are', 'there', 'instigate', 'crack', 'jokes.Jasmine', 'friend', 'was', 'annoying', 'had', 'attitude', 'apparent', 'reason', 'was', 'forever', 'business', 'so', 'basically', 'was', 'stereotypical', 'girlfriend', 'Michael', 'Hill', 'Harper', 'character', 'friends', 'were', 'hilarious', 'especially', 'gorgeous', 'guy', 'Jamaican', 'accent', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'been', 'other', 'movies', 'should', 'be', 'somebody', 'billboard', 'promoting', 'cologne', 'underwear', 'something', 'Funny', 'thing', 'purpose', 'movie', 'was', 'be', 'anything', 'sexy', 'was', 'pushy', 'funny', 'trifling', 'was', 'entertained', 'one', 'scenes', 'fell', 'out', 'laughing', 'when', 'told', 'Jasmine', 'friend', ""'re"", 'almost', 'as', 'sweet', 'hope', 'not', 'contagious', 'line', 'was', 'funny', 'too.So', 'was', 'movie', 'good', 'Not', 'really', 'would', 'never', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'was', 'kinda', 'watching', 'horror', 'flick', 'was', 'too', 'wrapped', 'up', 'not', 'look', 'away', 'cringed', 'whole', 'time', 'movie', 'seemed', 'more', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Hill', 'Harper', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'trying', 'make', 'guy', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'really', 'Then', 'again', 'movie', 'anybody', 'addicted', 'porn', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'really', 'thought-provoking', 'ending', 'was', 'predictable', 'guy', 'truck', 'braids', 'who', 'thought', 'certain', 'person', 'had', 'gun', 'was', 'terrible', 'actor.Would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'like', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'goofy', 'comedies', 'are', ""n't"", 'thing', 'probably', 'not']","Love, Sex & Eating The Bones"
