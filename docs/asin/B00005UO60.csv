684647,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00005UO60,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","True Grit, 1969 filmA man leaves his family at a ranch out West to buy Texas ponies. &#8220;Goodbye!&#8221; Maddy complains about Tom Cheney. In town a drunken man loses at cards. He is angry. A rifle is fired. There is a gala festival in Fort Smith where people gather to watch this event. [No &#8220;Jerry Show&#8221; in those days.] Three men entertain the crowd. Maddy Ross identifies her father. &#8220;Put the lid on it.&#8221; What is the Sheriff doing? Is it out of his jurisdiction? Maddy collects her father&#8217;s belongings. She wants to see the Federal Marshal, Rooster Cogburn. Maddy shows her spunk, she is cost-conscious. Mr. Le Beef arrive, he guess Maddy&#8217;s name. [He is a detective.] Maddy meets Cogburn and explains her desires. They dine together, Rooster pulls a cork. He is a good shot. [Why didn&#8217;t that cat keep that rat away?] Le Beef is looking for &#8220;Tom Cheney&#8221;, he is a sergeant in the Texas Rangers, and explains his motives. There is personal conflict.Maddy talks to a stable owner about her Dad&#8217;s horses. She is a hard bargainer. [Paper money, not cold cash?] Now she has the cash to hire Cogburn. They will leave at dawn. [This talk pads out the story.] Le Beef tells about the reward for Tom Cheney and how he will split it. Can Maddy follow Cogburn and Le Beef? Yes. [A long shot hides a stunt double.] Will she be left behind? Cogburn accepts her. Later Cogburn gets news about a mail robbery. They continue their journey into unsettled lands. Can they find a place to sleep? Rooster commands two men to disarm and talk. Will one man talk? [Isn&#8217;t that cabin too big?] &#8220;Remember the turkey.&#8221; They await the expected visitors. Cogburn talks about his checkered past. The next morning six men ride to that little cabin in the woods. Le Beef shoots a man. &#8220;Lucky Ned&#8221; escaped. They ride to McAlister with their four bodies. Maddy wants to continue the hunt, and she does. The next day Maddy goes to a stream and sees Tom Cheney there! &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d do it.&#8221; Maddy is captured!Ned Pepper offers a deal to Rooster: ride away and he&#8217;ll spare Maddy. Rooster agrees. Maddy is left alone with Tom Cheney, the others ride off. But Rooster is in front of them! One man against four? Yes. A good man triumphs over a bad man. Should Maddy disturb that rattlesnake? [Added drama to pad out the story.] Can Rooster save Maddy from the rattlesnake? [They didn&#8217;t know how to treat snakebite?] There is a convenient wagon available! Later lawyer J. Noble Daggett visits Rooster to thank him, pay him, and get a receipt. Rooster also collected the reward for Cheney. Rooster visits Maddy&#8217;s farm and sees the family graveyard. Maddy tells of her plans. The story ends.This is an average film. I think the later version of this story was better. This story has too much humor and unbelievable events to be considered excellent. John Wayne seems like a parody of his earlier roles. Glen Campbell was a popular singer then. Was Kim Darby&#8217;s character believable? Not even if it was written for a teenaged boy. Maddy seems too wise beyond her years. As with other movies, the men lack a beard after days on the trail; their clothes are freshly cleaned too. Was this movie produced to promote the movie career of Kim Darby?",3,The Search for a Fugitive Killer,1389484800,"01 12, 2014",2014,3345,"['True', 'Grit', '1969', 'filmA', 'man', 'family', 'ranch', 'out', 'West', 'buy', 'Texas', 'ponies', '8220', 'Goodbye', '8221', 'Maddy', 'Tom', 'Cheney', 'town', 'drunken', 'man', 'cards', 'angry', 'rifle', 'fired', 'gala', 'festival', 'Fort', 'Smith', 'where', 'people', 'gather', 'watch', 'event', '[', 'No', '8220', 'Jerry', 'Show', '8221', 'days', ']', 'Three', 'men', 'entertain', 'crowd', 'Maddy', 'Ross', 'father', '8220', 'Put', 'lid', 'it.', '8221', 'What', 'Sheriff', 'doing', 'jurisdiction', 'Maddy', 'father', '8217', 's', 'belongings', 'see', 'Federal', 'Marshal', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'Maddy', 'spunk', 'cost-conscious', 'Mr', 'Le', 'Beef', 'arrive', 'guess', 'Maddy', '8217', 's', 'name', '[', 'detective', ']', 'Maddy', 'meets', 'Cogburn', 'desires', 'dine', 'together', 'Rooster', 'cork', 'good', 'shot', '[', 'Why', 'didn', '8217', 'cat', 'keep', 'rat', 'away', ']', 'Le', 'Beef', 'looking', '8220', 'Tom', 'Cheney', '8221', 'sergeant', 'Texas', 'Rangers', 'motives', 'personal', 'conflict.Maddy', 'talks', 'stable', 'owner', 'Dad', '8217', 's', 'horses', 'hard', 'bargainer', '[', 'Paper', 'money', 'not', 'cold', 'cash', ']', 'Now', 'cash', 'hire', 'Cogburn', 'will', 'leave', 'dawn', '[', 'talk', 'out', 'story', ']', 'Le', 'Beef', 'reward', 'Tom', 'Cheney', 'how', 'will', 'split', 'Can', 'Maddy', 'follow', 'Cogburn', 'Le', 'Beef', 'Yes', '[', 'A', 'long', 'shot', 'stunt', 'double', ']', 'Will', 'be', 'left', 'Cogburn', 'Later', 'Cogburn', 'news', 'mail', 'robbery', 'continue', 'journey', 'unsettled', 'lands', 'Can', 'find', 'place', 'sleep', 'Rooster', 'two', 'men', 'disarm', 'talk', 'Will', 'one', 'man', 'talk', '[', 'Isn', '8217', 'cabin', 'too', 'big', ']', '8220', 'Remember', 'turkey.', '8221', 'await', 'expected', 'visitors', 'Cogburn', 'talks', 'checkered', 'past', 'next', 'morning', 'six', 'men', 'ride', 'little', 'cabin', 'woods', 'Le', 'Beef', 'man', '8220', 'Lucky', 'Ned', '8221', 'escaped', 'ride', 'McAlister', 'four', 'bodies', 'Maddy', 'continue', 'hunt', 'next', 'day', 'Maddy', 'stream', 'sees', 'Tom', 'Cheney', '8220', 'didn', '8217', 'think', '8217', 'do', 'it.', '8221', 'Maddy', 'captured', 'Ned', 'Pepper', 'deal', 'Rooster', 'ride', 'away', '8217', 'spare', 'Maddy', 'Rooster', 'Maddy', 'left', 'alone', 'Tom', 'Cheney', 'others', 'ride', 'off', 'Rooster', 'front', 'One', 'man', 'four', 'Yes', 'good', 'man', 'triumphs', 'bad', 'man', 'Should', 'Maddy', 'disturb', 'rattlesnake', '[', 'Added', 'drama', 'pad', 'out', 'story', 'Can', 'Rooster', 'save', 'Maddy', 'rattlesnake', 'didn', '8217', 'know', 'how', 'treat', 'snakebite', ']', 'convenient', 'wagon', 'available', 'Later', 'lawyer', 'J.', 'Noble', 'Daggett', 'Rooster', 'thank', 'pay', 'get', 'receipt', 'Rooster', 'also', 'collected', 'reward', 'Cheney', 'Rooster', 'Maddy', '8217', 'farm', 'family', 'graveyard', 'Maddy', 'tells', 'plans', 'story', 'ends.This', 'average', 'film', 'think', 'later', 'version', 'story', 'was', 'better', 'story', 'too', 'much', 'humor', 'unbelievable', 'events', 'be', 'considered', 'excellent', 'John', 'Wayne', 'parody', 'earlier', 'roles', 'Glen', 'Campbell', 'was', 'popular', 'singer', 'then', 'Was', 'Kim', 'Darby', '8217', 's', 'character', 'believable', 'Not', 'even', 'was', 'written', 'teenaged', 'boy', 'Maddy', 'too', 'wise', 'years', 'other', 'movies', 'men', 'lack', 'beard', 'days', 'trail', 'clothes', 'are', 'freshly', 'cleaned', 'too', 'Was', 'movie', 'produced', 'promote', 'movie', 'career', 'Kim', 'Darby']",N/A

Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon did a tremendous job as did the Coen brothers directing it.  I was told through friends that the new version actually might outdo the original.  After seeing the original, I have to say that I believe they're even.John Wayne really comes alive as Rooster Cogburn.  Unlike many of the leading roles he played in the past, Wayne really has flaws in this one as the boozing US Marshall.  His character is put into question in a court and he is described as &#34;double tough&#34; and likes to &#34;pull a cork.&#34;  And Wayne plays the part very well.  Glenn Campbell and Kim Darby offer solid performances as well.  And of course, for Robert Duvall fans, he shows up as Ned Pepper.  Also Dennis Hopper plays Moon.

684653,A150QS4IZB3XJ,B00005UO60,"April Vawter ""Wilderness Photographer""","[2, 15]","I admit up front, that I have never cared for John Wayne as an actor or as a person.  He came from a different era than me, and I've never found anything admirable about his personal dogma, nor his forced, cookie-cutter acting.  In this single piece, of the few I've seen, his acting was far better and more believeable.  He stands up well to Jeff Bridges, but with less gusto for the role.Glen Campbell as an actor was a fair singer, even though the opening song was trite and definitely pandering to a 1969 audience.  There is no way he can be compared to Matt Damon, who brought depth and believability.The girl, Mattie,(Kim Darby) in the 1969 version doesn't carry the role with the ""grit"" and force of Hailee Steinfeld, but her character develops well as the story progresses.  However, Hailee Steinfeld again brought far more depth and believablity to the role.Because the Coen Bros are sticklers for detail, their movies are always perfect, even their low-budget early efforts like Blood Simple and Raising Arizona.  The 1969 version looks and sounds like 1960s corner-cutting productions.  Wayne is always clean-shaven, and every character and prop looks new and unworn...not authentically aged.  (As an aside, I purchased a long-rifle used as a prop in the movie that was made in 1879, and it would have looked properly worn...I've never figured out where it was shown, remembering this is my first time watching it, but it was cheap.)As a first real example of fake-effects, Wayne shoots a rat during supper with a pistol that would have splattered it into bits, raised dust and put a hole in the wall.  Guess what?  It falls over, whole, and is served to a cat.  In a Coen Bros movie, it would have gone into soup, already minced.  And so numerous instances throughout go...Unfortunately, I was cheap and watched it streaming from Netflix.  Their version has a a horrible monoral soundtrack with an almost unlistenable echo.  I'm not sure I like it well enough to purchase the collector's edition from Amazon, but I'm also sure it must be better.The outdoor shots in the 1969 version are obviously shot with diffusion tenting and supplemental lighting and scream of the plasticity of the 50s and 60s.  Watching Mattie wake Cogburn after his previous night's bender and seeing Wayne still clean-shaven and immediately awake almost lost me.  I liked ""General"" the cat, however.We are comparing two movies that are over forty years apart in technique, style and acting, so there is no way to avoid many of the annoyances.  Overall,the original is almost a good, in its own way, as the newer version.  The story is basically the same, but the newer leaves me satisfied and wanting to watch it again.  Glenn Campbell, alone, even upgrading to a better soundtrack, leaves the older version as a pale comparison.

I have this movie on DVD, but do not have the Collectors Edition with the extras of filming locations.  I can't seem to find a single review here that talks about the DVD extras that tells me any information about the extras!  I KNOW the movie was filmed in and around Ridgeway and Telluride, Co. In fact, I've actually found the very spot John Wayne and Robert Duavall had their shoot out in field with the beautiful grove of Aspens. Sorry, I'm not telling where it is. And yes, I've been to Ridgeway, Co and been to the True Grit Cafe.  I was disappointed to find out the courthouse is not there anymore or was possibly a temporary set for the movie.  But the grassy area out under the cottonwood trees where the hanging took place looks nearly exactly the same.  Although, there is now a grocery store and some other businesses across the street looking back towards Ouray.Also, even though most of True Grit was filmed in and around Ridgeway, Co., the scene at the beautiful location of the cabin where they awaited Ned Pepper and his gang looked almost IDENTICAL to a spot in a Steve McQueen western ""NEVADA SMITH"".  It had Brian Keith in it and I know it was filmed in the Eastern Sierra region of California.  I suspect the above mentioned scene from True Grit was filmed in California,as well as the scene where John Wayne carried Kim Darby feverishly and furiously on horseback to get her to a doctor was also filmed in California.  I've been to the Eastern Sierras and I am very familiar with it's terrain.  I noticed there were hardly any Aspen trees at all in those scenes. Colorado is covered with Aspen trees.WHY.. you might ask, do I care WHERE the filming was done?

A feisty young woman plays opposite one of the great macho heroes of American cinema. At the time this was made, feminism was a hot concept, and it was no longer acceptable for the woman to play an entirely subordinate role. At the same time, the Western ethos in general and John Wayne in particular could not be distorted plausibly to accommodate the woman taking a dominant role. In an effort to deal with this dramatic problem, the young woman is captured and held hostage, thus incapacitated, basically admitting defeat in this uneasy attempt to ""modernize"" a Western. John Wayne gets his heroic rescue scene, and the macho code of the Western is sort-of renewed.The storytelling problems are exacerbated by the addition of a young Texas ranger, sometimes playing a sidekick role to Big John, sometimes defying him, sometimes flirting with the young girl, sometimes conflicting with her (including an embarrassing spanking scene), sometimes heroic, sometimes incompetent. With hopelessly inconsistent characters, a meandering plot with far too many people in it, and total lack of dramatic structure, the best that can be said about this mess is that the locations were well chosen. The editing, however, is clumsy, some of the panning shots are incompetent, and the picture quality is poor.This was a pathetic attempt by Hollywood to be ""modern.""

It probably was another case of Hollywood giving away Academy Awards (Wayne for best actor) for longevity in the business, if nothing else, because Wayne is fine but nothing exceptional here. This is the same role he played in Big Jake, The Searchers and a number of other films.But, he's fun to watch and listen to, as usual. The difference between this western and Wayne's others was Kim Darby, a fresh-faced strong-willed young woman who gives the story its unique angle. Even though Wayne is given the responsibility and chasing down the bad guys, it's really Darby doing it as young woman seeking the killer of her father.Darby doesn't come off, though, as some hardened woman. She's too cute for that, but she's feisty, doesn't take no for an answer and this role came along right at the beginnings of the feminist movement so it made her a popular figure at that time. Too bad she, or Hollywood, didn't capitalize more on her looks and talent. I don't know why she never made it as a film star because she certainly had the appeal in this movie.Anyway Wayne played what he played best: a crotchety-but-likable old man who delivered a lot of interesting lines. He's always tough on the outside but with a soft spot deep inside.The oddball in here was singer Glen Campbell, playing a Texas Ranger and being the third person in the killer-hunting trio. He wasn't bad, but not being a professional actor, he wasn't totally convincing, either. I don't really understand that choice of putting him in this role.Check out the actors who have minor roles in here: Jeremy Slate, Strother Martin, Robert Duvall, Dennis Hopper and more. Wow!One other question I had. How can this be rated ""G?"" I thought that meant nothing offensive was in the film, yet Wayne uses a number of damns, several ""bast--ds,"" and one memorable ""son of a bit-h!"" And it's rated ""G?"" Huh?

Rounding up the cast is sidekick La Boeuf (Glen Campbell) and Robert Duvall and Dennis Hopper as two outlaws.If one is not careful, nearly every great western ends up looking the same after a while.  And TRUE GRIT at first glance may look like any other western.  But it is so much more.  It has good acting (John Wayne received a Best Actor Academy Award), witty one-liners and sharp dialogue far superior to most of the action movies today, and some really intense action sequences, especially the now famous climactic gun fight as the Rooster gallops into a 1-on-4 fight with a six-shooter in his left hand and a rifle in his right hand and the reins in his teeth!If you're not into westerns you may still enjoy this move.

Thurlow,"[0, 0]","The 2010 remake of ""True Grit"" is a good excuse to look back at the 1969 original movie, the one that earned John Wayne a long overdue Oscar.  Both are based on the novel by Charles Portis, in which a young girl ventures into post-Civil War Indian Territory, in mid-winter, in search of her father's killer.The young girl, 14 year-old Mattie Ross (Kim Darby) had the good sense to go in company with an aging but tough one-eyed U.S. Marshal named Rooster Cogburn (Wayne), and a Texas Ranger (Glen Campbell).  The movie begins with a fairly funny sequence in which the plucky Mattie bullies first an undertaker and then a horse trader into doing business on her terms.  She then convinces Cogburn to undertake her mission of revenge.The trip into Indian Territory is no walk in the park.  The target of the three travelers is the shiftless but murderous Tom Chaney, who has taken up with Lucky Ned Pepper (a marvellous Robert Duvall) and his outlaw gang.  Their confrontation is the dramatic and suspense climax of the movie, and worth every bit of the price of admission.John Wayne was superb in the role, playing Cogburn with both the pathos of a lonely, aging alcoholic and a bravado that is crucial to the ending of the movie.  A final scene in a cemetary puts a nice ribbon on the story.

When she seeks help from the local authorities she gets no help whatsoever so she takes matters into her own hands to gain justice.Enter Rooster Cogburn.  A hard drinking marshall, he's got a reputation for having true grit when it comes to bringing in his man, so Maddie hires him to track down the man accused of murdering her father for the money that he had on him to buy those ponies.Turns out the murderer is running with a crowd of outlaws that the Texas Rangers are tracking because one of them killed a senator and they send Texas Ranger Glen Campbell after them, who takes a room at the same boarding house where Maddie is staying.The Texas Ranger convinces Rooster Cogburn that if they throw in together to get the culprits they can split the rewards and Maddie goes along to make sure that Rooster doesn't bail with her $25 downpayment for his help in bringing her father's murderer to justice.There's action, sure, and there's great humor as well, and mixed in is some utterly breathtaking scenery that just has to be seen to be believed.This movie and The Cowboys are two of my favorite John Wayne movies because despite the flaws that his character possesses, he never loses sight of doing the right thing at all costs.If you want to build a solid movie collection of classics, you absolutely must add this to it.",5,John Wayne at his finest,1318464000,"10 13, 2011",2011,1742,"['Spectacular', 'scenery', 'great', 'story', 'John', 'Wayne', 'doing', 'what', 'best', 'what', 'more', 'could', 'anyone', 'want', 'know', 'had', 'recent', 'remake', 'movie', 'got', 'alot', 'accolades', 'movie', 'it.You', 'ca', ""n't"", 'improve', 'perfection', 'classic', 'reason.Maddie', 'father', 'murdered', 'trying', 'buy', 'ponies', 'next', 'county', 'ranch', 'up', 'attend', 'matters', 'When', 'help', 'local', 'authorities', 'help', 'whatsoever', 'so', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'gain', 'justice.Enter', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'A', 'hard', 'drinking', 'marshall', 'got', 'reputation', 'having', 'true', 'grit', 'when', 'bringing', 'man', 'so', 'Maddie', 'track', 'down', 'man', 'accused', 'murdering', 'father', 'money', 'had', 'buy', 'ponies.Turns', 'out', 'murderer', 'running', 'crowd', 'outlaws', 'Texas', 'Rangers', 'are', 'tracking', 'one', 'killed', 'senator', 'send', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'Glen', 'Campbell', 'who', 'room', 'same', 'boarding', 'house', 'where', 'Maddie', 'staying.The', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'convinces', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'throw', 'together', 'get', 'culprits', 'can', 'split', 'rewards', 'Maddie', 'along', 'make', 'sure', 'Rooster', ""n't"", 'bail', '25', 'downpayment', 'help', 'bringing', 'father', 'murderer', 'justice.There', 'action', 'sure', 'great', 'humor', 'as', 'well', 'mixed', 'utterly', 'breathtaking', 'scenery', 'just', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed.This', 'movie', 'Cowboys', 'are', 'two', 'favorite', 'John', 'Wayne', 'movies', 'flaws', 'character', 'possesses', 'never', 'sight', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'costs.If', 'want', 'build', 'solid', 'movie', 'collection', 'classics', 'absolutely', 'must', 'add']",N/A

He stands for that all-American goodness so happy and honorable it wouldn't hurt a fly. He called High Noon un-American for its selfish depictions of the townsfolk, I call it one of the best westerns, if not the best western of all time. Here however, I actually like Wayne. He actually feels like a real human being as the gruff and tough Rooster Cogburn. He's likable, and he holds a nice presence on screen. Unfortunately, he's basically the only good thing in a film that hasn't aged very well.AMC has been replaying this film a lot lately with the remake having just come out, so it's kind of interesting comparing the two films even though they take their source material differently. Both Roosters are great in their own way for instance. Both Cheney's are kind of menacing, although Brolin is clearly much more so. Matt Damon is easily better than Glenn Campbell, but the remake certainly doesn't have a young Robert Duvall & Dennis Hopper hanging out in the background. Then there's Mattie Ross, who both movies rely on heavily for plot reasons and such. As such, the quality of both movies heavily ride on the character and how she's portrayed. There's a reason for instance why Hailee Steinfeld is nominated for an Oscar for her performance, because she carries the film very well, and makes Mattie Ross a strong female character.The original is quite the opposite, and as a result, the movie is kind of god-awful.Kim Darby never was a good actress in any sense of the word, but when she was a kid, she was just awful in every sense of the word. She's shrill, annoying, and just plain stupid. Granted, a lot of it is bad writing for the character, but Kim Darby plays her no favors. Instead of a strong female character, we have a little girl who Justin Bieber apparently stole his haircut from, who's hard to take seriously, and falls stupidly into the damsel-in-distress dynamic more than once. As a result, every scene she's in, which is a lot of the film, verges on either being laughable, or cringe-inducing.Overall, coming at the film from a very modern prospective, I found the original True Grit very hard to get through at times. Some of the acting is pretty good, and it's good to see John Wayne in one of his best roles, but Kim Darby's Mattie Ross kind of torches the whole production in a heap of cringe-inducing smoke, that looks even more smoldered now that we have a good remake to compare it too.",2,False Grit,1298851200,"02 28, 2011",2011,2524,"['find', 'very', 'hard', 'like', 'John', 'Wayne', 'was', 'Justin', 'Bieber', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'western', 'all-American', 'goodness', 'so', 'happy', 'honorable', 'would', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'fly', 'called', 'High', 'Noon', 'un-American', 'selfish', 'depictions', 'townsfolk', 'call', 'one', 'best', 'westerns', 'not', 'best', 'western', 'time', 'Here', 'however', 'actually', 'Wayne', 'actually', 'real', 'human', 'being', 'gruff', 'tough', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'likable', 'nice', 'presence', 'screen', 'Unfortunately', 'basically', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'film', ""n't"", 'aged', 'very', 'well.AMC', 'been', 'replaying', 'film', 'lot', 'lately', 'remake', 'having', 'just', 'come', 'out', 'kind', 'interesting', 'comparing', 'two', 'films', 'even', 'take', 'source', 'material', 'differently', 'Roosters', 'are', 'great', 'own', 'way', 'instance', 'Cheney', 'are', 'kind', 'menacing', 'Brolin', 'clearly', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'easily', 'better', 'Glenn', 'Campbell', 'remake', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'have', 'young', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'hanging', 'out', 'background', 'Then', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'who', 'movies', 'rely', 'heavily', 'plot', 'reasons', 'such', 'such', 'quality', 'movies', 'heavily', 'ride', 'character', 'how', 'portrayed', 'reason', 'instance', 'why', 'Hailee', 'Steinfeld', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'strong', 'female', 'character.The', 'original', 'quite', 'opposite', 'result', 'movie', 'kind', 'god-awful.Kim', 'Darby', 'never', 'was', 'good', 'actress', 'sense', 'word', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'was', 'just', 'awful', 'sense', 'word', 'shrill', 'annoying', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'Granted', 'lot', 'bad', 'writing', 'character', 'Kim', 'Darby', 'favors', 'Instead', 'strong', 'female', 'character', 'have', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'Justin', 'Bieber', 'apparently', 'stole', 'haircut', 'who', 'hard', 'take', 'seriously', 'stupidly', 'damsel-in-distress', 'dynamic', 'more', 'once', 'result', 'scene', 'lot', 'film', 'being', 'laughable', 'cringe-inducing.Overall', 'coming', 'film', 'very', 'modern', 'prospective', 'found', 'original', 'True', 'Grit', 'very', 'hard', 'get', 'times', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'good', 'see', 'John', 'Wayne', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'Kim', 'Darby', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'kind', 'torches', 'whole', 'production', 'heap', 'cringe-inducing', 'smoke', 'even', 'more', 'smoldered', 'now', 'have', 'good', 'remake', 'compare', 'too']",N/A

I read a review that suggested the best way to watch this version is to use the subtitles and listen to the Directors Comments.  I would suggest that might be true, but I sent it back before exploring that option.Wayne is in good form, for an old man with one lung.  Like Bogart he always plays himself, but to decidedly more mixed results.  1969 of course was a world away from us, and this film is a product of its era, with the young girl bringing in the Women's Lib element as an added thorn to a Good Old Fashioned lawman's side, already well scraped by persnickety lawyers.  Unfortunately, Kim Darby is so utterly offensive in her role that many will want to ride up the trail just to shoot her and get the movie moving, which is the chief role she's supposed to play.  The opening song is nearly toxic (watch any old western by John Ford and dare to tell me otherwise) and while the movie is shot in gorgeous locales, they really don't add to the film, as they do in the new version.Of course, when John Wayne puts those reins in his mouth and rides towards the baddies, well, what can I say?

The presence of the girl gives the film some originality, otherwise all the tricks have already been used and even overused, like the rattlesnake, the pit, - it is true without a pendulum - the river to cross on horseback, and many others.John Wayne being older is no longer as adventurous as before and he kind of cuts a fatherly image in a genre where the father is not the hero. You might even be surprised by one or two twists in the standard fabric of the Western and we are spared the Indians in Indian territory.Apart from that the Far West after the Civil War was a no law's land but with plenty of men trying to make a living from action and violence, either to express their deep frustration with society or to repress that kind of expression. The sheriff or the marshal was in no way better than the criminals he was running after and getting dead or alive.

As to John Wayne's role ,it was probably even harder,letting himself be bossed around by a kid.There are a lot of actors with small parts and even large parts,such as Glen Campbell and Robert Duval,but none of them pull off performances like Wayne and Darby.I would go so far as to say that this movie was probably Wayne's greatest performance, or  it may have been in &#34;The Quiet Man&#34;),but it took a giant of an actor to play his role and make this movie one of the best Westerns ever.This movie was filmed in 1968 and 1969 when Wayne was 61.There were lots of heavy acting scenes,and riding that Wayne pulled off as would an actor much youngerThe photography quality and the scenery far exceeded what is normally found in Westerns.For all these reasons ,this is a Classic..",5,"On receiving an Academy Award for this movie Wayne said,""If I had only known,I'd have put that patch on 35 years earlier.""",1389139200,"01 8, 2014",2014,1591,"['movie', 'set', 'Texas', '1880', 'story', 'basically', 'simple.Kim', 'Darby', 'who', 'Mattie', 'revenge', 'death', 'rancher', 'father', 'who', 'shot', 'card', 'game.Although', 'Mattie', 'only', '14', 'as', 'much', '34', 'Grit', '34', 'US', 'Marshal', 'Reuben', 'J', '34', 'Rooster', '34', 'Cogburn', 'who', 'hired', 'bring', 'father', 'murderer', 'justice.Cogburn', 'rough', 'edged', 'can', 'get', 'was', 'not', 'uncommon', 'tough', 'men', 'be', 'sides', 'law', 'days.A', 'very', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'movie', 'Mattie', 'role', 'where', 'make', 'decisions', 'others', 'much', 'more', 'experienced', 'usually', 'make..She', 'be', 'very', 'forcefull', 'getting', 'way', 'very', 'difficult', 'role', 'play', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'greatest', 'actors.And', 'put', 'bluntly', 'unbelieveably', 'well', 'John', 'Wayne', 'role', 'was', 'probably', 'even', 'harder', 'letting', 'be', 'bossed', 'are', 'lot', 'actors', 'small', 'parts', 'even', 'large', 'parts', 'such', 'Glen', 'Campbell', 'Robert', 'Duval', 'none', 'pull', 'off', 'performances', 'Wayne', 'Darby.I', 'would', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'probably', 'Wayne', 'greatest', 'performance', 'may', 'have', 'been', '34', 'Quiet', 'Man', '34', 'took', 'giant', 'actor', 'play', 'role', 'make', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'ever.This', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', '1968', '1969', 'when', 'Wayne', 'was', '61.There', 'were', 'lots', 'heavy', 'acting', 'scenes', 'riding', 'Wayne', 'pulled', 'off', 'as', 'would', 'actor', 'much', 'youngerThe', 'photography', 'quality', 'scenery', 'far', 'exceeded', 'what', 'normally', 'found', 'Westerns.For', 'reasons', 'Classic..']",N/A

In that 1.85 aspect ratio the image is soft as I said. However, in the supplemental documentary there are several scenes from the movie that appear to be in about 2.35 or close that look sharp just like they should. But True Grit wasn't a 2.35 scope process movie! What is going on here? I understand if a scope movie is shown in 1.85 the image has been enlarged and it would look soft, but it is a 1.85 movie and it looks soft which usually means the studio messed up the transfer.

But the characters are fun, Darby a prototype feminist, financially comfortable, who has the means to hire the ornery Rooster to find her Father's killer; Campbell is a ""Texican Peace Officer"" who goes along for the ride; tries to keep his well-manicured hands off the under-aged Mattie; Wayne is Wayne and that's good for all of us.Very strong screenplay works for Wayne, who gets off plenty of Wayne-ims, indeed, presents many new ones..""baby sister"", ""big feller"".What gives this Wayne an edge is that he delivers his lines with nuance, as if he is also saying, I've ""been here, done that"" so ""I'll learn these whippersnappers a thing or two about the rough side of life"". He's Leader, Teacher.Kim Darby's performance is good but a bit flat; she finally emotes in a late scene, when caught in a snake pit - delivers one of the greatest screams in film history.There's a wonderful longshot of Wayne carrying Darby back to safety (after a snake bite) which will give Wayne/Searchers fans a warm glow.Reviewers have remarked that Campbell is awful as La Boeuf. Well, remember that Wayne has always used young pop singers in his pictures - Frankie Avalon, Ricky Nelson. So while Glenn was having monster hits he stepped into more gold and found himself at the top of the *movie* business. His acting....not bad, not good. Looks like he watched a lot of ""Gunsmoke"" to prepare for his part. Gotta say, that theme song, as sung by Glenn, was and is a winner, though.The musical soundtrack is predictably effective but on this VHS it's too loud and too often.Art Department does a great job, especially with the interiors.Strother Martin, Dennis Hopper have great scenes with the Duke.

684740,A13IKSGDYNBNQS,B00005UO60,S J Buck,"[1, 2]","This is a quite unusual western. John Wayne plays the aging, hard drinking, overweight Rooster Cogburn, a Marshall hired by Mattie Ross (kim Darby) to find the killer of her father. Glen Campbell is the Texas Ranger who helps them out. The unusual element is the script, its well written and both Wayne and Darby make full use of its witty lines.The film is also beautifully shot. There is one great shot where the trio approach a hideout and you see this panoramic view of the valley with the river snaking through. The sun is reflected off the water - its a wonderfully constructed shot. I wanted to be there straight away!The remainder of the cast is very good. Robert Duvall is there as Ned Pepper, and Dennis Hopper plays Moon. But its Waynes film through and through, he dominates every scene, even when you think Kim Darby has stolen it he'll have one last look or frustrated hmmff to steal it back. Its not Waynes best ever performance and he probably didn't deserve the Oscar he won for True Grit, but rather like Martin Scorcese for The Departed it was right that he won for the body of work he produced down the years.",4,John Waynes film,1191974400,"10 10, 2007",2007,1129,"['quite', 'unusual', 'western', 'John', 'Wayne', 'aging', 'hard', 'drinking', 'overweight', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'Marshall', 'hired', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'kim', 'Darby', 'find', 'killer', 'father', 'Glen', 'Campbell', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'who', 'out', 'unusual', 'element', 'script', 'well', 'written', 'Wayne', 'Darby', 'make', 'full', 'use', 'witty', 'lines.The', 'film', 'also', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'one', 'great', 'shot', 'where', 'trio', 'approach', 'hideout', 'see', 'panoramic', 'view', 'valley', 'river', 'snaking', 'sun', 'reflected', 'water', 'wonderfully', 'constructed', 'shot', 'wanted', 'be', 'there', 'straight', 'away', 'remainder', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'there', 'as', 'Ned', 'Pepper', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'Moon', 'Waynes', 'film', 'scene', 'even', 'when', 'think', 'Kim', 'Darby', 'stolen', ""'ll"", 'have', 'one', 'last', 'look', 'frustrated', 'hmmff', 'steal', 'back', 'not', 'Waynes', 'best', 'ever', 'performance', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'Oscar', 'won', 'True', 'Grit', 'rather', 'Martin', 'Scorcese', 'Departed', 'was', 'right', 'won', 'body', 'work', 'produced', 'years']",N/A
