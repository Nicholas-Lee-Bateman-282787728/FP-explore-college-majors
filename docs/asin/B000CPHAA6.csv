959857,A1AC9S8U66SNMU,B000CPHAA6,Buenoslibros.es,"[1, 3]","Here are about 5 years in the life of two young boys from the Appalachian mountains of Kentucky. They go to an alternative school, and we observe their daily lives go by up to the time they graduate from High School. The filmmaker is never heard or seen, which is good: this way we can relate more fully with Cody and Chris, who soon get used to carrying the mike on their clothes and they carry on with their lives in the most natural way possible (still, I wonder how much influence did this fact, being taped for a documentary, play in their daily decisions, in the outcome of the film. I think it helped them more than not. Knowledge of being watched and taped constantly must have made them, at least, a little more responsible for the decisions they were making).The good thing about documentaries like this one is that you can pick up whatever interests you most. Here are some samples:  1. Who's: who is more (and why) likable; who had it toughest; who do I identify most with; 2. What's: what are the things I don't like (or approve) of them; what were the critical decisions they had to make; what would I have done differently. You can also focus on the secondary characters: the principal and teachers; how important a role did they play in these kids' lives, and would I have done something differently? And, of course, we can look at the social and economical conditions of both their families. One kid had it much easier financially than the other, but how much did that influence at the finish line?There are lots of things you can look into. One of the most interesting ones to me was their familiar surroundings, their relatives, and immediate family members. Or rather lack of family. Put the terrible familiar conditions in which both kids started out in a more global perspective (say, the whole US), and think how many kids in America start out in life with that huge burden. Lack of fatherhood is the biggest problem in the our Western societies. Little else is needed to overload our kids. Our welfare systems can't cope with all this; actually it's (in my modest opinion) the growing presence of the welfare system that keeps pushing away parents from the responsibilities that are theirs by nature's law.The director, David Sutherland, seems to take aim at the implications of the ever present religious billboards; and at Cody's obvious religious sentiments, however confused they are. The implications are there for us to figure out; and every person will probably make his own conclusions.One final thing: I think we are putting too much responsibility on the backs of kids; everything, and all the time, was about them. It all depended on their choices. But they had NOBODY TO BE ACCOUNTABLE TO. This is what we have taught them: they can do whatever they want, it's their lives, and we only give advise but don't implicate ourselves. All the adults are very (outwardly) concerned about their ""making it"" to the finish line, and this meaning graduating and going to college. But why should that be the only goal. Are we so downright materialists? Well, somebody may not ""make it"" there, then what? game over? In this sense the film was really saddening because it tell us pretty loudly that our whole society is missing the point. If graduating going to college to become a money thirsty lawyer is all we have to inculcate to our kids, we are in bad shape indeed. Where's the love, altruism, compassion, respect; where are the dreams? No family. No values. Not even dreams (besides becoming rich). The message is not optimistic.",4,Fathers Needed or the breakdown of the American family,1181606400,"06 12, 2007",2007,3558,"['Here', 'are', '5', 'years', 'life', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'Appalachian', 'mountains', 'Kentucky', 'go', 'alternative', 'school', 'observe', 'daily', 'lives', 'go', 'time', 'graduate', 'High', 'School', 'filmmaker', 'never', 'heard', 'seen', 'good', 'way', 'can', 'relate', 'more', 'fully', 'Cody', 'Chris', 'who', 'soon', 'get', 'used', 'carrying', 'mike', 'clothes', 'carry', 'lives', 'most', 'natural', 'way', 'possible', 'still', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'influence', 'did', 'fact', 'being', 'taped', 'documentary', 'play', 'daily', 'decisions', 'outcome', 'film', 'think', 'helped', 'more', 'not', 'Knowledge', 'being', 'watched', 'taped', 'constantly', 'must', 'have', 'made', 'least', 'little', 'more', 'responsible', 'decisions', 'were', 'making', '.The', 'good', 'thing', 'documentaries', 'one', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'interests', 'most', 'Here', 'are', 'samples', '1.', 'Who', 'who', 'more', 'why', 'likable', 'who', 'had', 'toughest', 'who', 'do', 'identify', 'most', '2', 'What', 'are', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'approve', 'were', 'critical', 'decisions', 'had', 'make', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'differently', 'can', 'also', 'focus', 'secondary', 'characters', 'principal', 'teachers', 'how', 'important', 'role', 'did', 'play', 'kids', 'lives', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'something', 'differently', 'course', 'can', 'look', 'social', 'economical', 'conditions', 'families', 'One', 'kid', 'had', 'much', 'easier', 'financially', 'other', 'how', 'much', 'did', 'influence', 'finish', 'line', 'are', 'lots', 'things', 'can', 'look', 'One', 'most', 'interesting', 'ones', 'was', 'familiar', 'surroundings', 'relatives', 'immediate', 'family', 'members', 'rather', 'lack', 'family', 'Put', 'terrible', 'familiar', 'conditions', 'kids', 'started', 'out', 'more', 'global', 'perspective', 'say', 'whole', 'US', 'think', 'how', 'many', 'kids', 'America', 'start', 'out', 'life', 'huge', 'burden', 'Lack', 'fatherhood', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Western', 'societies', 'Little', 'else', 'needed', 'overload', 'kids', 'welfare', 'systems', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cope', 'actually', 'modest', 'opinion', 'growing', 'presence', 'welfare', 'system', 'pushing', 'away', 'parents', 'responsibilities', 'are', 'theirs', 'nature', 'law.The', 'director', 'David', 'Sutherland', 'take', 'aim', 'implications', 'ever', 'present', 'religious', 'billboards', 'Cody', 'obvious', 'religious', 'sentiments', 'however', 'confused', 'are', 'implications', 'are', 'there', 'figure', 'out', 'person', 'will', 'probably', 'make', 'own', 'conclusions.One', 'final', 'thing', 'think', 'are', 'putting', 'too', 'much', 'responsibility', 'backs', 'kids', 'everything', 'time', 'was', 'depended', 'choices', 'had', 'NOBODY', 'TO', 'BE', 'ACCOUNTABLE', 'TO', 'what', 'have', 'taught', 'can', 'do', 'want', 'lives', 'only', 'give', 'advise', 'do', ""n't"", 'implicate', 'ourselves', 'adults', 'are', 'very', 'outwardly', 'concerned', 'making', 'finish', 'line', 'meaning', 'graduating', 'going', 'college', 'why', 'should', 'be', 'only', 'goal', 'Are', 'so', 'downright', 'materialists', 'Well', 'somebody', 'may', 'not', 'make', 'there', 'then', 'what', 'game', 'sense', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'saddening', 'tell', 'pretty', 'loudly', 'whole', 'society', 'missing', 'point', 'graduating', 'going', 'college', 'become', 'money', 'thirsty', 'lawyer', 'have', 'inculcate', 'kids', 'are', 'bad', 'shape', 'indeed', 'Where', 'love', 'altruism', 'compassion', 'respect', 'where', 'are', 'dreams', 'family', 'values', 'Not', 'even', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'rich', 'message', 'not', 'optimistic']",Country Boys: A Film By David Sutherland

Each boy has significant family problems to deal with.  Chris's father is unemployed and a severe alcoholic.  Cody is an orphan being raised by his step-grandmother.

There, I found an ""docudrama"" about two appalachian boys called Cody and Chris, following their trials and tribulations while attending a private high school. So engrossed was I, I watched the next two ""installments,"" staying up past my ""bedtime"" to do so. Now, of course, I won't have to stay up beause I just ordered this beautiful film on DVD.""Country Boys"" had all the fixin's for being a ""pitying"" film. That is, it is a film about two poor boys attending a school for the academically struggling in Eastern Kentucky. Cody does not have parents (his father murdered his mother when he was very young.) Chris had an alcoholic father and a mother trying to make it any way she can. But far from pitying its subjects, we get to see not only the dark side, but the bright side, of each boy's life. We get to see not only failures (there are some of those), but successes. You will think about these boys and this town long after the 6 hours of film is over.What really affected me about the film was that you get a real sense not only of who these boys are, but what the community is like. From the close-knit family that is the David School (the private high school for the acedemically challenged) to Cody and Chris's respective support ""networks,"" you see both the ugliness and beauty that is Appalachia.This is one of the few films that I have had trouble not thinking too much about after it was over. Now, all I have to do is wait for the DVD to come.",5,A Film to Think About Long After it is Over.,1137542400,"01 18, 2006",2006,1563,"['first', 'saw', 'Country', 'Boys', 'one', 'evening', 'groggily', 'scrolling', 'channels', 'got', 'PBS', 'found', 'docudrama', 'two', 'appalachian', 'boys', 'called', 'Cody', 'Chris', 'following', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'attending', 'private', 'high', 'school', 'So', 'engrossed', 'was', 'watched', 'next', 'two', 'installments', 'staying', 'up', 'past', 'bedtime', 'do', 'so', 'Now', 'course', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'stay', 'beause', 'just', 'ordered', 'beautiful', 'film', 'DVD', 'Country', 'Boys', 'had', 'fixin', 'being', 'pitying', 'film', 'film', 'two', 'poor', 'boys', 'attending', 'school', 'academically', 'struggling', 'Eastern', 'Kentucky', 'Cody', 'not', 'have', 'parents', 'father', 'murdered', 'mother', 'when', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'Chris', 'had', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'mother', 'trying', 'make', 'way', 'can', 'far', 'pitying', 'subjects', 'get', 'see', 'not', 'only', 'dark', 'side', 'bright', 'side', 'boy', 'life', 'get', 'see', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'successes', 'will', 'think', 'boys', 'town', 'long', '6', 'hours', 'film', 'over.What', 'really', 'affected', 'film', 'was', 'get', 'real', 'sense', 'not', 'only', 'who', 'boys', 'are', 'what', 'community', 'close-knit', 'family', 'David', 'School', 'private', 'high', 'school', 'acedemically', 'challenged', 'Cody', 'Chris', 'respective', 'support', 'networks', 'see', 'ugliness', 'beauty', 'Appalachia.This', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'have', 'had', 'trouble', 'not', 'thinking', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'Now', 'have', 'do', 'wait', 'DVD', 'come']",Country Boys: A Film By David Sutherland
959860,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B000CPHAA6,"Promise ""promise""","[1, 1]","I was heartened to see the five star average of the reviews here.  Perhaps people who don't care for this type of thing just didn't watch it so weren't around to criticise it.  I love documentaries.  I have to admit, though, that I found this a bit long and draggy in parts. Obviously it's paced for TV and watching it all in one sitting may be overwhelming. I watched it over two evenings.As others have said, this is a look at the lives of two teenagers in Appalachia over a three year period.  I suppose everyone will have their favorite of the two and of the supporting cast of characters.  Personally I found it hard to warm up to Cody, and was relieved when the camera turned to Chris.  Yet Cody was the class valedictorian and appeared to have some sort of charisma that attracted his classmates to him.  It just didn't come across on film to me.  I did really like his girlfriend's father, Roy, though.  Roy was a handsome charming guy who sang and played guitar like the best of any Country singer I've heard.  He should be a star!Chris, on the other hand, was the one who won my heart early on.  He was heroic in his struggle between trying to take care of his highly dysfunctional family and getting on with his education. He's the one I'll be thinking about for a long time, wishing him well.The film maker gives us generous pictures of the supporting characters and some of them come across as heroic, too.  The wonderful principal of David School gets highest grades for her no-nonsense, but extremely compassionate help for Chris.  I teared up, as others did, when she announced her resignation and I had to wonder why....It was great to see her appear again at Chris's graduation.  The quality of caring that the school staff showed for these kids was amazing.  Maybe some of it was staged for the camera, but some of it must have been real.My only complaint regarding the film making was the staged feeling to so many of the conversation.  We saw many of them, between the one of the boys and: the step-grandmother, the principal, the mother, a teacher,the pastor, etc.  They had a rehearsed quality that seemed artificial and even tedious after a while.  However the boys, themselves seemed perfectly natural for the most part, which is amazing.  Chalk it up to youth.This is a film that will keep you thinking  for a long time. I add too, that it's refreshing to see something in mainstream media (well, not exactly mainstream) that shows Christianity in a positive light.",5,Life is infinitely more interesting than most fiction,1274054400,"05 17, 2010",2010,2491,"['was', 'heartened', 'see', 'five', 'star', 'average', 'reviews', 'here', 'Perhaps', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'type', 'thing', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'so', 'were', ""n't"", 'around', 'criticise', 'love', 'documentaries', 'have', 'admit', 'though', 'found', 'bit', 'long', 'draggy', 'parts', 'paced', 'TV', 'watching', 'one', 'sitting', 'may', 'be', 'overwhelming', 'watched', 'over', 'two', 'evenings.As', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'look', 'lives', 'two', 'teenagers', 'Appalachia', 'three', 'year', 'period', 'suppose', 'everyone', 'will', 'have', 'favorite', 'two', 'supporting', 'cast', 'characters', 'Personally', 'found', 'hard', 'warm', 'up', 'Cody', 'was', 'relieved', 'when', 'camera', 'turned', 'Chris', 'Cody', 'was', 'class', 'valedictorian', 'appeared', 'have', 'sort', 'charisma', 'attracted', 'classmates', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'film', 'did', 'really', 'girlfriend', 'father', 'Roy', 'though', 'Roy', 'was', 'handsome', 'charming', 'guy', 'who', 'sang', 'played', 'guitar', 'best', 'Country', 'singer', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'should', 'be', 'star', 'Chris', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'won', 'heart', 'early', 'was', 'heroic', 'struggle', 'trying', 'take', 'care', 'highly', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'getting', 'education', 'one', ""'ll"", 'be', 'thinking', 'long', 'time', 'wishing', 'well.The', 'film', 'maker', 'generous', 'pictures', 'supporting', 'characters', 'come', 'heroic', 'too', 'wonderful', 'principal', 'David', 'School', 'highest', 'grades', 'no-nonsense', 'extremely', 'compassionate', 'help', 'Chris', 'teared', 'up', 'others', 'did', 'when', 'announced', 'resignation', 'had', 'wonder', 'why', '.It', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'appear', 'again', 'Chris', 'graduation', 'quality', 'caring', 'school', 'staff', 'showed', 'kids', 'was', 'amazing', 'Maybe', 'was', 'staged', 'camera', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'real.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'regarding', 'film', 'making', 'was', 'staged', 'feeling', 'so', 'many', 'conversation', 'saw', 'many', 'one', 'boys', 'step-grandmother', 'principal', 'mother', 'teacher', 'pastor', 'etc', 'had', 'rehearsed', 'quality', 'seemed', 'artificial', 'even', 'tedious', 'while', 'However', 'boys', 'seemed', 'perfectly', 'natural', 'most', 'part', 'amazing', 'Chalk', 'up', 'youth.This', 'film', 'will', 'keep', 'thinking', 'long', 'time', 'add', 'too', 'refreshing', 'see', 'something', 'mainstream', 'media', 'well', 'not', 'exactly', 'mainstream', 'Christianity', 'positive', 'light']",Country Boys: A Film By David Sutherland
959861,A1TK6WNUIAEQRU,B000CPHAA6,stoic,"[1, 9]","My wife and I both have family in Appalachia. So, we thought that the documentary Country Boys would be great. We were wrong. After about 20 minutes, we were giving each other puzzled looks. Then things got worse.Country Boys focuses on two impoverished teens in eastern Kentucky. Both come from dysfunctional families and attend an alternative high school. Neither is interesting or likable.Chris Johnson is reasonably intelligent, but can't leave the alternative school because his family will lose the check that they receive for his fake disability. Chris volunteers to start a school newspaper then disappears for weeks so that he won't have to finish it. He whines because he can't get a driver's license unless he stays in school.Cody Perkins inanely mumbles about Christianity and his hair while fighting with his teachers. He spends long, boring stretches with his girlfriend Jessica. Cody's grandmother finds evidence of their love in the form of a used condom that Cody threw on his bedroom's floor.As the film wore on, we both gave in and started laughing at things that weren't supposed to be funny. Cody's hard rock Christian songwriting is much worse than any Spinal Tap song. The school that the boys attend coddles its students while pushing fundamentalism. In one scene, Cody's science class discusses reproduction. Cody mumbles that men are now getting pregnant and the teacher responds that God is against it.What were the filmmakers thinking? Maybe they got a grant or couldn't bear to admit defeat. I can't believe that they followed these guys for three years.In the end, we managed just 90 minutes of this six-hour dud. I'm not sure what the other reviewers saw. I've never posted a one-star review, but Country Boys earned that dubious distinction.",1,The Horror!
