Now I personally found this anime really good and it was really funny, my favorite character being Arestta and that being because she is such a masochist. It has it share of fan service so it cool with me. Now one of the most noticeable problems will be the audio, it seems to be off for some reason kinda like it was on mono instead of stereo but its really hard to explain so sorry. Now I myself as well as others have gone to Media Blasters facebook page and complain about the audio and so far MB has denied any problems with the audio, I've yet to recieve a response from them. So far the video quality is good but its the sound that its messed up. So it sucks that Media Blasters drop the ball on this one, hopefully they don't do this with future titles especially their Kitty Label titles.",4,"Love it, but no short episodes and audio problems.",1373932800,"07 16, 2013",2013,952,"['first', 'saw', 'anime', 'crunchyroll.com', 'was', 'censored', 'did', 'crunchyroll', 'have', 'shorts', 'so', 'day', 'still', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'short', 'episodes', 'Now', 'personally', 'found', 'anime', 'really', 'good', 'was', 'really', 'funny', 'favorite', 'character', 'being', 'Arestta', 'being', 'such', 'masochist', 'share', 'fan', 'service', 'Now', 'one', 'most', 'noticeable', 'problems', 'will', 'be', 'audio', 'be', 'off', 'reason', 'kinda', 'was', 'mono', 'instead', 'stereo', 'really', 'hard', 'explain', 'so', 'sorry', 'Now', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'have', 'gone', 'Media', 'Blasters', 'facebook', 'page', 'complain', 'audio', 'so', 'far', 'MB', 'denied', 'problems', 'audio', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'recieve', 'response', 'So', 'far', 'video', 'quality', 'good', 'sound', 'messed', 'up', 'Media', 'Blasters', 'drop', 'ball', 'one', 'hopefully', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'future', 'titles', 'especially', 'Kitty', 'Label', 'titles']",Juden Chan

The art work is by far the best I have seen and when I say this guy can draw its because I can draw and I wish I had just some of his tallent.  The story line is just as good if you love slap stick humor than this is the disc for you.  people forget that anime is an art form all on it's own now I would'nt let kids under say 15 view this because of nudity and content.

Aiken ""social observer""","[13, 13]","UPDATE:As this was pre-ordered,I got it today and immediately put it to the test:It is UNCENSORED, rated 16+, not for the kiddies;there are a few scenes not really for anyone under 18. The service was excellent,there  are three discs and extra scenes are drawn,most being anti-piracy ads.There is no reason I am able to find for this series to be so cheap and,as such I have ordered a ""spare"".This is a kinky little comedy.Plug is a Charger Girl (Ju-den Chan) from a parallel universe. Her job is to seek out depressed people in our world and recharge them.Plug is also not the brightest of bulbs but has a sweet personality,good heart and is determained to do the best for the people. Her co-worker,Arrasta, is opposite in nearly all respects and approaches the job as just a job;quitting time is quitting time and quantity over quality. She also has serious knockers...and classes. The two get along about as well as two cats with their tails tied together. The story includes a young male that can see them,even in their ""stealth"" mode as they fly around,even through walls, looking for people to charge up. He is startled when Plug flies through the wall at the resturant where he works and he instinctively hits her with a baseball bat. He does this to both her and Arasta frequently,causing Arasta to become enjoy it. In the background an anime series is being played,from time to time,on available TV's featuring a magic girl named Milly.The artists that drew this series probably paid apt attention in anatomy classes as aspects particular to the female seem to be correct and well-detailed as one might expect when the girls wear a rubber suit of about one micron thick....without underwear.As this series is well paced and directed it is also well recommended. The cost of this DVD is about 1/3rd less than ones from the ""other"" market.",5,Juden Chan-AKA  Charger Girl (Ju-den Chan),1369785600,"05 29, 2013",2013,1846,"['UPDATE', 'was', 'pre-ordered', 'got', 'today', 'immediately', 'put', 'test', 'UNCENSORED', 'rated', '16+', 'not', 'kiddies', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'not', 'really', 'anyone', '18', 'service', 'was', 'excellent', 'are', 'three', 'discs', 'extra', 'scenes', 'are', 'drawn', 'most', 'being', 'anti-piracy', 'ads.There', 'reason', 'am', 'able', 'find', 'series', 'be', 'so', 'cheap', 'such', 'have', 'ordered', 'spare', '.This', 'kinky', 'little', 'comedy.Plug', 'Charger', 'Girl', 'Ju-den', 'Chan', 'parallel', 'universe', 'job', 'seek', 'out', 'depressed', 'people', 'world', 'recharge', 'them.Plug', 'also', 'not', 'brightest', 'bulbs', 'sweet', 'personality', 'good', 'heart', 'determained', 'do', 'best', 'people', 'co-worker', 'Arrasta', 'opposite', 'nearly', 'respects', 'job', 'just', 'job', 'quitting', 'time', 'quitting', 'time', 'quantity', 'quality', 'also', 'serious', 'knockers', 'classes', 'two', 'get', 'along', 'about', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'cats', 'tails', 'tied', 'together', 'story', 'young', 'male', 'can', 'see', 'even', 'stealth', 'mode', 'fly', 'around', 'even', 'walls', 'looking', 'people', 'charge', 'up', 'startled', 'when', 'Plug', 'wall', 'resturant', 'where', 'instinctively', 'baseball', 'bat', 'Arasta', 'frequently', 'causing', 'Arasta', 'become', 'enjoy', 'background', 'anime', 'series', 'being', 'played', 'time', 'time', 'available', 'TV', 'featuring', 'magic', 'girl', 'named', 'Milly.The', 'artists', 'drew', 'series', 'probably', 'paid', 'apt', 'attention', 'anatomy', 'classes', 'aspects', 'particular', 'female', 'seem', 'be', 'correct', 'well-detailed', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'when', 'girls', 'wear', 'rubber', 'suit', 'one', 'micron', 'thick', '.without', 'series', 'well', 'paced', 'directed', 'also', 'well', 'recommended', 'cost', 'DVD', '1/3rd', 'less', 'ones', 'other', 'market']",Juden Chan

The onyl thing you should be wary of is that the makers of this anime didn't seem to understand that ladies don't pee themselves when they receive sudden immense pleasure. That blue-haired girls pees quite a bit. Otherwise, I love this anime! The boy doesn't have too much to do with the series, and the girls aren't really fighting over him or anything (and they aren't sharing him, either. Yes, Asobi ni Iku Yo, I AM grumbling at you for taking that route!), and you end up liking the characters quite a bit. After watching the episodes on dvd, watch the 6 short episodes as well.

Evidentally, this anime has become a classic in my collection. The story is basic, but in a different situation in each episode. The main characters are plug, arresta, and sento. Sento hitting them with a baseball bat cracks me up. The basic story is that plug and arresta's job is to charge people who are depressed and are at the verge of suicide. It is a very good story. I am a little disappointed that the ova's are absent from this dvd. However, they have been released online.
