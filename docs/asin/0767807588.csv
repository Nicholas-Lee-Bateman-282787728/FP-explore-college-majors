8564,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,0767807588,,"[0, 0]","Released in 1993, Bruce Willis' &#34;Striking Distance&#34; has a bad reputation. Roger Ebert tore it to pieces, basically saying it was too derivative and by-the-numbers, and Willis himself said he hated it. After finally seeing it I can understand criticism to a point. The story has a very melodramatic comic-book vibe, which is obvious in the opening act, almost like a TV production except with a superior cast and action scenes. But -- and this is an important but -- I quickly found myself drawn into the story & the characters and greatly enjoyed the Pittsburgh locations, the (melo)drama and the thrills. In other words, the movie IS entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game.The story revolves around Tom Hardy (Willis), a Pittsburgh detective, who's demoted to police river rescue. A serial killer returns after a two-year absence and bodies of beautiful women start turning up in the river, all women whom Hardy used to date! Sarah Jessica Parker is on hand as Hardy's partner on the river.This is a cop thriller in the manner of the Dirty Harry series, except more comic booky and taking place in Pittsburgh rather than San Francisco. It's also reminiscent of films like &#34;The General's Daughter.&#34; Although not technically as good as the Dirty Harry movies or &#34;The General's Daughter&#34; due to the cartooniness, &#34;Striking Distance&#34; nevertheless pulled me into the lives of the characters and gave the requisite thrills. As such, I feel it's at least as good as some of the lesser Dirty Harry films.The generically-named &#34;Striking Distance&#34; was originally called &#34;Three Rivers&#34; -- a much better title simply because it's more specific -- but was changed at the last minute because the marketing department feared people would think it was a sports movie due to Three Rivers Stadium, so they switched it to &#34;Striking Distance.&#34; Why? The first hint is at the beginning of the move when the title card shows two electrical bolts coming out from either side of the title. Later we observe the mysterious killer using a stun gun before killing his victims and, with a stun gun, you must of course be within... striking distance!Speaking of the killer, one element of the plot I haven't mentioned is that this a whodunit. Someone is charged with being the killer early on but Hardy knows it's the wrong guy; in fact, he and others are sure it's a cop or ex-cop doing the killings. There are a few suspects, including Hardy himself, but -- I'll be honest with you -- I was unable to guess the right person. There's another twist late in the story that also took me by surprise.The bottom line is that &#34;Striking Distance&#34; is a cop thriller that effectively entertains and entertainment is the name of the game. Plus it was shot in Pittsburgh, a refreshing change.The film runs 102 minutes.GRADE: B",4,Comic book cop thriller in Pittsburgh,1405209600,"07 13, 2014",2014,2867,"['Released', '1993', 'Bruce', 'Willis', '34', 'Striking', 'Distance', '34', 'bad', 'reputation', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'tore', 'pieces', 'basically', 'saying', 'was', 'too', 'derivative', 'by-the-numbers', 'Willis', 'said', 'hated', 'finally', 'seeing', 'can', 'understand', 'criticism', 'point', 'story', 'very', 'melodramatic', 'comic-book', 'vibe', 'obvious', 'opening', 'act', 'almost', 'TV', 'production', 'superior', 'cast', 'action', 'scenes', 'important', 'quickly', 'found', 'drawn', 'story', 'characters', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'Pittsburgh', 'locations', 'melo', 'drama', 'thrills', 'other', 'words', 'movie', 'IS', 'entertaining', 'entertainment', 'name', 'game.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Willis', 'Pittsburgh', 'detective', 'who', 'demoted', 'police', 'river', 'rescue', 'serial', 'killer', 'returns', 'two-year', 'absence', 'bodies', 'beautiful', 'women', 'start', 'turning', 'up', 'river', 'women', 'whom', 'Hardy', 'used', 'date', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'hand', 'Hardy', 'partner', 'river.This', 'cop', 'thriller', 'manner', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'series', 'more', 'comic', 'booky', 'taking', 'place', 'Pittsburgh', 'rather', 'San', 'Francisco', 'also', 'reminiscent', 'films', '34', 'General', 'Daughter.', '34', 'not', 'technically', 'as', 'good', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'movies', '34', 'General', 'Daughter', '34', 'due', 'cartooniness', '34', 'Striking', 'Distance', '34', 'nevertheless', 'pulled', 'lives', 'characters', 'gave', 'requisite', 'thrills', 'such', 'feel', 'least', 'as', 'good', 'lesser', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'films.The', 'generically-named', '34', 'Striking', 'Distance', '34', 'was', 'originally', 'called', '34', 'Three', 'Rivers', '34', 'much', 'better', 'title', 'simply', 'more', 'specific', 'was', 'changed', 'last', 'minute', 'marketing', 'department', 'feared', 'people', 'would', 'think', 'was', 'sports', 'movie', 'due', 'Three', 'Rivers', 'Stadium', 'switched', '34', 'Striking', 'Distance.', '34', 'Why', 'first', 'hint', 'beginning', 'move', 'when', 'title', 'card', 'two', 'electrical', 'bolts', 'coming', 'out', 'side', 'title', 'Later', 'observe', 'mysterious', 'killer', 'using', 'stun', 'gun', 'killing', 'victims', 'stun', 'gun', 'must', 'course', 'be', 'striking', 'distance', 'Speaking', 'killer', 'one', 'element', 'plot', 'have', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'whodunit', 'Someone', 'charged', 'being', 'killer', 'early', 'Hardy', 'wrong', 'guy', 'fact', 'others', 'are', 'sure', 'cop', 'ex-cop', 'doing', 'killings', 'are', 'few', 'suspects', 'including', 'Hardy', ""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'unable', 'guess', 'right', 'person', 'twist', 'late', 'story', 'also', 'took', 'surprise.The', 'bottom', 'line', '34', 'Striking', 'Distance', '34', 'cop', 'thriller', 'effectively', 'entertainment', 'name', 'game', 'was', 'shot', 'Pittsburgh', 'refreshing', 'change.The', 'film', '102', 'minutes.GRADE', 'B']",N/A
8565,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0767807588,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Striking Distance, 1993 filmThis story is set in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. An alarm sends a police car speeding after a car. [A car chase always provides action.] But the wanted car gets away. [Else the story would be over too soon.] The sought criminal gets away. [You can&#8217;t do this with a compact car.] A crash ends the chase. &#8220;The killer got away.&#8221; Tommy was hurt, his father killed. An eyewitness identified a suspect. Where&#8217;s Jimmy? Tommy is resented because of his testimony against his partner. Two years later Tommy has a new assignment- the River Police. Do others resent him? There&#8217;s a dead woman floating in the river, shot with a small caliber pistol. An old friend visits Tommy on his houseboat. Later Tommy gets a new partner, also trained as a paramedic. He is surprised.No speeding on the river. The notice trouble on a tugboat. Tommy stops the robbers. Later a nurse leaves work at night. Tommy gets a telephone call at night. Later he retrieves some files, then goes to find a man. There is a call about another murder victim in the river. Children found the body. What did Chickanis know? An old friend drops by, he is an ex-cop. Tommy says the murderer dropped the bodies in the river so he could find them. [Is it personal?] We see what Tommy said two years earlier. Was the wrong man convicted by perjury? [A clue to the solution?] Tommy&#8217;s presence at the Policemen&#8217;s Ball is resented, but he has some friends. &#8220;You don&#8217;t belong here!&#8221; Tommy&#8217;s partner explains how she became a policewoman - she solved a rape. They see a long object dumped into the river from a bridge! The chase is on!Can a flare gun halt a suspect? That long object has a surprise! Jo and Tommy become friendlier. Tommy knew the third murder victim too! The police learn of Hardy&#8217;s connection to the murder victims. There is testimony from a surprise witness, Emily Harper, who evaluated Hardy! Harper gets a surprise when she returns to her room! So does Hardy when he returns home to his houseboat. Another body in the river. Hardy goes to visit a friend. &#8220;Surprised?&#8221; [Yes!] Who had a motive against Hardy? &#8220;I like this game.&#8221; We learn what happened earlier. [Is this believable?] Gunshots end the talk. Sirens announce the approaching police. There is another chase with motorboats on the river. [Done at night for privacy?] Then a chase on foot. An oncoming train adds action. One man comes out of the river. Hardy is vindicated. &#8220;On the other hand ....&#8221; There seems to be a happy ending.This is a very good movie until the last ten minutes. A surprise worked in &#8220;The Third Man&#8221; but not here. It requires belief for an implausible and unbelievable ending; its as if the writer was cheating the viewer. Don&#8217;t you agree? One good thing about this movie is its setting in Pittsburgh. Most crime shows take place in Los Angeles, near Hollywood. I wonder what was the reason for this setting? It reminds us of the danger of convicting the innocent by false witnesses. Can an innocent man be induced to confess to a crime he didn&#8217;t commit? The movie &#8220;Boomerang&#8221; documents one example. &#8220;Call Northside 777&#8221; is another example of &#8220;Convicting the Innocent&#8221; (see the book of the same name).

8568,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0767807588,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","Some movies are just bad.  Like, there is nothing redeeming about them, they are just outright bad.  `Striking Distance' is one of those movies.  The script is ridiculous, preposterous and clich&eacute;d.  The acting is terrible from everyone on board and the action, while suitable, is nothing of particular note.  From opening sequence to closing kiss, this movie is just BAD.It's a shame, because I tend to like the cast, or at least parts of it, and Willis, while gravitating towards tired cop thrillers in the early stages of his career, was able to bring an intensity and freshness to most of them.  Not this one though.  From his melodramatic performance to Brion James nauseating presence to the screenplays consistent stupidity (from the actions of the police officers to the unraveling of the plot to the tacked on love interest), `Striking Distance' is one of the worst films this genre has ever offered us.  Robert Pastorelli camps it up beyond belief in a performance I can't really even describe, it is that bad.I don't want to spoil the film for any of you who actually want to see this, but I don't think I'll ever be able to take a film seriously that cannot even attempt to give the characters an ounce of professionalism.  The police force as a whole is portrayed as a group of no-brained, conscienceless scoundrels who are as dumb as they are cruel.  The turnabout that these characters undergo at the end, especially Farina's character (like, now you care? And why exactly?  What is so different about what he's doing now and what he's already done?) makes no sense at all.That's this film's biggest problem, it just makes no sense, doesn't try to fails to do anything worth remembering.",1,Dead in the water...,1373328000,"07 9, 2013",2013,1708,"['movies', 'are', 'just', 'bad', 'nothing', 'redeeming', 'are', 'just', 'outright', 'bad', 'Striking', 'Distance', 'one', 'movies', 'script', 'ridiculous', 'preposterous', 'clich', 'eacute', 'acting', 'terrible', 'everyone', 'board', 'action', 'suitable', 'nothing', 'particular', 'note', 'opening', 'sequence', 'closing', 'kiss', 'movie', 'just', 'BAD.It', 'shame', 'tend', 'like', 'cast', 'least', 'parts', 'Willis', 'gravitating', 'towards', 'tired', 'cop', 'thrillers', 'early', 'stages', 'career', 'was', 'able', 'bring', 'intensity', 'freshness', 'most', 'Not', 'one', 'though', 'melodramatic', 'performance', 'Brion', 'James', 'nauseating', 'presence', 'screenplays', 'consistent', 'stupidity', 'actions', 'police', 'officers', 'unraveling', 'plot', 'tacked', 'love', 'interest', 'Striking', 'Distance', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'genre', 'ever', 'offered', 'Robert', 'Pastorelli', 'camps', 'up', 'belief', 'performance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'even', 'describe', 'bad.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'film', 'who', 'actually', 'want', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'take', 'film', 'seriously', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'attempt', 'give', 'characters', 'ounce', 'professionalism', 'police', 'force', 'whole', 'portrayed', 'group', 'no-brained', 'conscienceless', 'scoundrels', 'who', 'are', 'as', 'dumb', 'are', 'cruel', 'turnabout', 'characters', 'undergo', 'end', 'especially', 'Farina', 'character', 'now', 'care', 'why', 'exactly', 'What', 'so', 'different', 'what', 'doing', 'now', 'what', 'already', 'done', 'sense', 'film', 'biggest', 'problem', 'just', 'sense', ""n't"", 'try', 'fails', 'do', 'anything', 'remembering']",N/A

You know, it's where information needs to be given to the audience, and the only way that the filmmaker can figure out how to give out that information is by having at least one character sit around and listen (quite literally here) while the one giving the info discusses, in full detail, why he killed people, how he did it, and how the person sitting is going to die too.  The guy -- or gal -- sitting is really just you; he or she is a proxy for the passing of &#34;knowledge.&#34;And then we've got all kinds of endings built upon endings; this thing unfortunately never seems to want to die.

8580,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,0767807588,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 2]","In Sept. 1993, a suspenseful thriller starring action star Bruce Willis (""Die Hard"", ""The Fifth Element"", ""The Sixth Sense) and actress Sarah Jessica Parker (""Sex and the City"", ""Ed Wood"", ""L.A. Story"") was released in theaters.The film was directed by Rowdy Herrington (""Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius"" and ""The Stickup"") and a screenplay co-written by Herrington and Marty Kaplan (""Max Q"" and ""The Distinguished Gentleman"").  The film would feature music by Brad Fiedel (""Johnny Mnemonic"", ""Timecop"" and ""True Lies"") and cinematographer Mac Ahlberg (""Good Burger"", ""Ragdoll"", ""The Brady Bunch Movie"" and ""Beverly Hills Cop III"").VIDEO & AUDIO:For a film released in 1993, I'm going to be truthful, I was expecting a film that was going to be heavily DNR'd (Digital Noise Reduction) and look soft with less detail.  This was not the case, ""STRIKING DISTANCE"" which received its first 1080p High Definition transfer (1:85:1 aspect ratio) looks absolutely beautiful on Blu-ray.  Outdoor scenes with sunlight and multiple colors look vibrant, you can see skin tones quite well, blacks are nice and deep and blues are nice and beautiful. Also, grain is present and captures that film-like quality.Equally impressive was the audio soundtrack for the film.  The film is presented in English, French and Portuguese Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (and Spanish 5.1) and from the opening scenes, there is good use of the rear surrounds during the car chase scene and also gun shots.  In fact, some scenes I detected usage of LFE which was nice.Is it as immersive as today's modern action films?  The answer is no.  But considering the age of the film, I was happy to hear a nice clean dialogue but also special effects coming nice and clear through the front channels and my surrounds.Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:There are no special features but trailers for upcoming Sony Pictures Home Entertainment releases.  The Blu-ray disc is BD-Live Enabled.JUDGMENT CALL:""STRIKING DISTANCE"" was an enjoyable, suspenseful thriller.  Back in 1993, Bruce Willis who had such a wonderful rise to fame with both ""Die Hard"" films returned with several action films that people either loved or hated.  From ""Hudson Hawk"", ""The Last Boyscout"" and even his lighthearted roles as the voice for films such as ""Look Who's Talking"" and his role as David Addison on the popular TV show ""Moonlighting"" was still fresh on the minds of many people who enjoyed his work.Personally, I felt that Bruce Willis is an ""everyman"", an actor who can play a variety of roles in his career (which he has demonstrated quite well in the last 25 years) but around that time, many people were basing everything that he did and comparing it with ""Die Hard"".""STRIKING DISTANCE"" is no die hard.  Bruce Willis may be playing a cop and he may go a bit gung ho at times but his character as Tom Hardy is scarred.  From the death of his father and women he was romantically with, having to wear a brace on his leg and so he is not exactly mobile.  The character is flawed but for me, that's what made his character so appealing.Sarah Jessica Parker (many years before ""Sex and the City"" made her a huge star) was an actress that caught our attention in the 1991 romantic comedy ""L.A. Story"" but previous to that, most of us connected through Parker from her role in the 80's show ""Square Pegs"", so to see her in an action film and being the main love interest opposite to Bruce Willis was quite interesting.  And she provides that necessary balance between her character and Willis's character of Tom Hardy.The film is a fun popcorn flick and it does have its farfetched moments.  But I watched the film having low expectations (considering many critics did n0t enjoy it) and by the end of the film, actually enjoying it. In fact, there were times that I felt the film was becoming too predictable.  Actually, in the first half hour, I felt I figured out the film but it was nice to see how the writers played with the storyline and gave us a pretty interesting and surprising reveal of the killer's identity at the end.""STRIKING DISTANCE"" also has the benefit of receiving a pretty good transfer from Sony but again, another classic release that is barebones with no commentary or special features whatsoever.  Not even the film's trailer is included.In the end, for those who enjoyed the film and own it on DVD, the double dip is worth it if you are wanting it for the improved picture and audio quality.  For those not familiar with the film and are wondering if it's an action film they can enjoy, it's worth checking out.Overall, ""STRIKING DISTANCE"" is not the best suspenseful, thriller and by no means does it match the action of a ""Die Hard"" film but it does have an intriguing, suspenseful storyline with a surprising reveal at the end.",4,Blu-ray: Found this film to be quite entertaining

But Detective Sergeant Tom Hardy (Bruce Willis), who is one member of a police family in the Pittsburgh Police Department, is now on the case. Tom Hardy is out of favour with his colleagues because he reported his partner and cousin, Sergeant Jimmy Detillo (Robert Pastorelli), for using excessive force. However, Tom's father, Captain Vince Hardy (John Mahoney) is on his side and believes he did the right thing.Almost from the beginning they have the killer cornered with his latest victim and a long and exciting car chase involving Tom and Vince Hardy follows. But there are several accidents along the way and in the last of these, the killer shoots Vince Hardy and gets away. All the evidence suggests the killer is a cop but Tommy's uncle, Captain Nick Detillo (Dennis Farina) railroads some unlikely suspect into custody as the killer. In a separate incident, Jimmy Detillo throws himself into the Ohio River, presumably as an act of desperation.The story now moves on two years and Tommy is now a member of the river police with a new partner, Jo Christman, alias Emily Harper (Sarah Jessica Parker). But the bodies keep coming and `Little Red Riding Hood' keeps in touch with Tommy, even dumping his victims in the river for him to find.

Bruce Willis is reliably good - but this movie sucks as hard as any movie with Bruce Willis possibly could.

And Willis strikes a lot of wrong notes (Spoiler alert: someone is killing his ex-girlfriends, but he barely seems interested) which I don't blame on him - I blame the writer/director of this mess. Sarah Jessica Parker is predictably ""blah"" as Willis's partner (or IS she...?). She speaks in a mousey voice, shows no apparent emotions, and she's presented as if she's some sort of hot mama...although all WE can see is that she's a skinny woman with a big honking nose, a horse face, some sort of wart on her chin, and a chest configuration that is just freaking ODD.

8596,A25RN8X70DSZLU,0767807588,JRP,"[0, 0]","Hello out there welcome to this review as part of my 20 years ago & 2003 in film reviews. This review is for the underrated Bruce Willis movie Striking Distance. This movie wasn't well received by the critics it has a 15 percent on Rotten Tomatoes so that proves that critics & a bunch of hipsters at Rotten Tomatoes don't know what they're talking about & why we should all make up our own minds. Made on a budget of $30 million made $24 million in The US mad $8 million more overseas so it broke even & made money it just wasn't a hit. Directed by Rowdy Harrington he directed Road House. Movie stars Bruce Willis as Sergeant Tom Hardy, Dennis Farina as Captain Nick Detillo, Sarah Jessica Parker as Jo Christman, Brion James as Sergeant Eddie Eiler, John Mahoney as Captain Vince Hardy, Robert Pastorelli as Jimmy Detillo & Tom Sizemore as Danny Detillo. The story is about a Pittsburgh Cop named Tom Hardy who is going to testify in a trial against another Cop for using excessive force on a suspect. Meanwhile there is this this killer in Pittsburgh going around killing women named The Polish Hill Strangler. Hardy & his Father who is a veteran Cop are going to The Policeman's Ball they end up in a high speed chase with The Polish Hill Strangler Hardy notices that the driver drives like a Cop. 1 thing leads to another both cars go off the road & crash Captain Detillo tells Hardy that his Father was killed in the crash & that The Polish Hill Strangler. He ends up being told they caught killer of his Father some guy spotted him on the bridge throwing a body over the bridge. Hardy doesn't believe that this guy done it. Also The Cop he was suppose to testify against which this Cop he is to testify against is also Captain Detillo's Son. Captain Detillo tries to stop his Son from jumping Hardy shows up & tries to talk him out of it but he jumps off the bridge. Then we get to 2 years later & Sergeant Hardy has been demoted cause he accused a Cop of killing his Father he is now working as a River Rescue Cop he has a female partner named Jo Christman. On their 1st mission out on the river they stop a group of teens he takes their booze Hardy is about to drink it but his Partner Jo makes him pour it out you get the idea that she cares about her partner. So I care about Bruce Willis & Sarah Jessica Parker. Also on their 1st mission together where Hardy is taking down these thugs on this ship there is this guy who is going to attack Hardy from behind & Jo yells at him to look out so you know they care about each other & I care about these 2 characters. The Polish Hill Strangler has turned up again he is now killing women that who were involved with Tom Hardy. He still has issues with The Pittsburgh PD especially with Sergeant Eddie Elier cause he feels that Hardy turned on his own cause he was going to testify against a Cop Captain Detillo is jerk to to Hardy. An Ex Cop named Danny has returned to area after what happened 2 years prior he happens to be Tom's Cousin. Another women who works as a Nurse has been taken by The Polish Hill Strangler. He calls Hardy & play the song Little Red Riddinghood which is his trademark. That sets Hardy off he starts his own investigation on his Father's death. 1 day when Hardy & Jo are on duty Hardy goes into town he goes after the guy who claims he spotted his Father's killer he wants to find out who put him up to it he has the guy on the ground at gun point. Jo stops him they go respond to this call where another body has been found & this woman dated Hardy at 1 time. Jo convinces Hardy to go to The Policeman's Ball where he gets in a fight with Sergeant Eiler. Jo talks to Hardy about his drinking problem I sort of believe them falling in love. So little later on Hardy & Jo spot this guy dropping something into the river they try to chase him down & warn him to stop then Hardy fires a Flare Gun at the car the car catches fire but it ends up being the wrong guy which Sergeant Eiler who already hates Hardy gives him mores  h  it & he catches more from Captain Detillo. Eiler & Detillo want Hardy removed from the force Eiler thinks Hardy is behind the killings since they all have a connection to him. Detillo tells him he doesn't have enough but Detillo has had Jo Christman undercover investigating Hardy to see if he's been doing anything illegal it turns out her real name is Emily Harper. She lies on the stand cause she cares about Tom. Later on Emily is kidnapped. Hardy figures out a pattern & believes that Danny is the killer. His Cat leaves a blood trail his bed is soaked in blood He goes to confront Danny Hardy is knocked out it turns out the killer is Jimmy Detillo who is still alive. He has Tom, Emily & Danny tied up. He's going to kill Emily he is angry at Danny for not sticking up for him. Captain Detillo shows up he tries to talk some sense into his Son Jimmy says that Captain Detillo killed Tom's Father. On the day Vince Hardy died Detillo found out his Son was The Polish Hill Strangler Vince had gotten out of the wreckage where he was going to kill Jimmy. Detillo & Vince got in a struggle where Detillo shot & killed Vince Hardy & Jimmy got away Detillo tells his Son that they're going to turn themselves in. Jimmy is set off even more Detillo shoots him but Jimmy has a Bulletproof Vest on he kills his Dad Danny tackles Jimmy & Tom has a chance to break himself free. Jimmy escapes on a motorboat. Tom chases after him where they end up at this Train Depot Tom thinks he has killed Jimmy when a train came through but he got out of the way then they fall into the river Tom thinks he has drown Jimmy but he comes back up he's got a tazer Tom shoves it into Hardy's mouth & it kills him. Later on Eiler apologizes for what he's done to him he says go ahead & take a shot Tom tells him no but he can't help himself he knocks him out. The movie ends with Tom placing some flowers on his Father's Grave he's gotten together with Emily she has a Daughter from another marriage his Dad wanted Grandchildren  & Tom says Grandchildren at his Father's Grave. Final thoughts the 1st 5 or 10 minutes feel a little off but after that I just got into the movie I was pleasantly surprised cause had only seen this movie in bits & pieces. I stayed involved you had 2 likable leads you have obstacles that keep getting thrown to the lead which makes you want to root for him more. Rowdy Harrington did a really good job directing. Bruce Willis did a great job. Dennis Farina did a very good job it's sad that he passed away recently he was a great actor. Sarah Jessica Parker was really good & this was also when she was really hot. Brion James did a very good job. John Mahoney did a pretty good job. Robert Pasterelli was good. Tom Sizemore was really good. I don't see why this got bad critical reviews this movie is awesome. So if you see this on TV watch it if your video store has it rent it. I know if I see this for sale in like a Wal Mart or whatever I'll buy it. My next review in this series will be 2003 in film The Rundown.",5,20 years ago Striking Distance 9/10,1379376000,"09 17, 2013",2013,7038,"['Hello', 'there', 'welcome', 'review', 'part', '20',

8597,ASCR6RUWOU1F9,0767807588,Kane's Review,"[0, 0]","I recently saw this movie air on My NetworkTV and being the retro movie lover I am, this is another movie to be added to my Retro Favorites Vault.The legendary Bruce Willis stars as Tom Hardy, a depressed, alcoholic member of the Pittsburgh Police River Rescue, dealing with the murder of his father, former Captain, Vince Hardy who was killed in 1991 and the killer was never found. 2 years prior, one of the deemed suspects, Jimmy Detillo committed suicide by jumping off a bridge into a lake, just as mother did many years before. His body was never found.The year is now 1993 and Tom now serves on the River Rescue Squad after being demoted from Homicide Detective after publicly stating on the news that the the killer, dubbed the &#34;Polish Hill Strangler&#34; was a member of the department. His cousin, Danny Detillo has stepped down from the force and is also an alcoholic, due to the suicide of Jimmy.After getting calls about female bodies being dumped in the local river, Tom discovers that each female his a female he was associated with at some point in his life. In addition to their deaths, he receives ominous and eerie phone calls, similar to the ones he received 2 years earlier by the Polish Hill Strangler. Believing that the Polish Hill Strangler is still on the loose, Tom goes to incredible lengths to track down the killer. Unfortunately the other force members, including his own new partner, the beautiful Jo Christman, believe that Tom is crazy and that the killer is a copycat and not the Polish Hill Strangler.From there on, Tom puts his pride, reputation, and job on the line to find the killer responsible for the death of his father and many of the females associated with him. While on the hunt, Jo begins to suspect that Tom isn't crazy and that there is real, liable truth to his claims, causing a close bond to be developed between the two. Jo helps Tom search the rocky trail of the anonymous murderer but as they come closer and closer to their answers, Jo may very well become the next victim of the Polish Hill StranglerOverall: I really enjoyed this movie and will definitely have to get it on DVD in the future. The plot of the movie is solidly scripted together and at many points, you feel bad for Tom and know that even though he seems crazy to his peers, everything he says is the truth. Another thing I love about this film is that you can tell it was made in the 90s with the 90s esque name for the killer, the Polish Hill Strangler. Above all else, this movie is enjoyable, beginning, middle, and end.

I like action movies but didn't really like this one. I'm not usually a fan or follower of the big name action films, I'm picky. It's a matter of not wanting to waste my time watching something dumb, I tell myself. Or again, thinking I'm smart or something, wanting to savor the movie experience and not wanting to wear it out. I like action movies, but not That much. I can resist them. I usually do, actually.One day while sitting around the house here, subjected to one of these action movies playing on TV and not wanting to watch it, I said something like, 'come on, you know whats going to happen at the end'. 'The good guy and the bad guy are going to have a shoot-out, both of them will lose their guns, then the good guy is going to punch the bad guy out' - inspiration strikes me at times, especially when a show isn't looking too good on television and I don't want to watch (I've noticed if the film is on Lifetime network, some combination of the mother, children, and ex-husband are going to punch out the obsessed stalker at the end).Striking Distance was surely intended to be a comedy on the part of the filmmakers. Maybe intended as an inside joke. Not sure whats more ridiculous/funny. That Pittsburgh Pennsylvania has riverboat cops, who have been working their beat for decades, or the fact that Bruce Willis can chase down a bad guy in a river boat while wearing handcuffs, then fall into the water after their boats crash, and then, still wearing handcuffs, in the water, punch out the bad guy.The end.But no, false ending. The bad guy still has some life in him. Surely Bruce Willis can punch him out one more time?How about wearing a straight-jacket, in a bed of quicksand?",2,The End.,1308182400,"06 16, 2011",2011,1842,"['Bruce', 'Willis', 'river', 'boat', 'cop', 'descended', 'long', 'line', 'river', 'boat', 'cops', 'Pittsburgh', 'Pennsylvania', 'home', 'three', 'rivers', 'stadium', 'action', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'one', ""'m"", 'not', 'usually', 'fan', 'follower', 'big', 'name', 'action', 'films', ""'m"", 'picky', 'matter', 'not', 'wanting', 'waste', 'time', 'watching', 'something', 'dumb', 'tell', 'again', 'thinking', ""'m"", 'smart', 'something', 'wanting', 'savor', 'movie', 'experience', 'not', 'wanting', 'wear', 'out', 'action', 'movies', 'not', 'much', 'can', 'resist', 'usually', 'do', 'actually.One', 'day', 'sitting', 'house', 'here', 'subjected', 'one', 'action', 'movies', 'playing', 'TV', 'not', 'wanting', 'watch', 'said', 'something', 'know', 'whats', 'going', 'happen', 'end', 'good', 'guy', 'bad', 'guy', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'shoot-out', 'will', 'lose', 'guns', 'then', 'good', 'guy', 'going', 'punch', 'bad', 'guy', 'inspiration', 'strikes', 'times', 'especially', 'when', 'show', ""n't"", 'looking', 'too', 'good', 'television', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'film', 'Lifetime', 'network', 'combination', 'mother', 'children', 'ex-husband', 'are', 'going', 'punch', 'out', 'obsessed', 'stalker', 'end', '.Striking', 'Distance', 'was', 'surely', 'intended', 'be', 'comedy', 'part', 'filmmakers', 'Maybe', 'intended', 'inside', 'joke', 'Not', 'sure', 'whats', 'more', 'ridiculous/funny', 'Pittsburgh', 'Pennsylvania', 'riverboat', 'cops', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'working', 'beat', 'decades', 'fact', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'can', 'chase', 'down', 'bad', 'guy', 'river', 'boat', 'wearing', 'handcuffs', 'then', 'fall', 'water', 'boats', 'crash', 'then', 'still', 'wearing', 'handcuffs', 'water', 'punch', 'bad', 'guy.The', 'end.But', 'false', 'ending', 'bad', 'guy', 'still', 'life', 'Surely', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'can', 'punch', 'out', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'How', 'wearing', 'straight-jacket', 'bed', 'quicksand']",N/A

This is one of those characters.  (I wonder if this was Bruce's first movie role as a cop?  He still has hair) :-)In this role he plays a 5th generation cop, his uncles and cousins are cops also. John Mahoney (famous for his role as the dad in the sitcom ""Frasier"") plays his dad.  The guy who played the house painter ""Eldon"" in the sitcom ""Murphy Brown"" plays Bruce's cousin and first partner in this movie.  But he went out of control and Bruce (as his partner) testified against him.  It was the right thing to do, but naturally the rest of the force thinks of him as a rat who turned on his partner - made worse because they were family.There is a killer out there who likes to call the cops and play the song ""little red riding hood"" and tell them where to find the bodies. Bruce was a detective on the case - he eventually gets busted down to a patrol cop on the river where he gets assigned Sarah Jessica Parker as his partner. He refuses to believe recent cases are NOT the same killer as the red riding hood strangler, and believes it's a cop - and the other cops are trying to keep him from investigating, but the victims are all people he was close to (or at least dated).Bruce is one of my favorite tough guys to watch, but this movie was before he started his trademark smirk we love.

8611,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,0767807588,Only-A-Child,"[10, 13]","There are two mysteries to ""Striking Distance"" (1993) which drive this movie and provide the character motivation; as things build toward a climax (and only ten minutes remain to wrap everything up) you know that two has to be one-that the same thing will be the answer to both questions because not enough time remains to untangle two ""different"" sets of misdirection.Of course first-time viewers applying first-class logical reasoning skills  will never guess the answer, because someone (presumably the writers) cheats at the end and introduces the deus ex machina device. Dating back to Greek tragedy, deus ex machina is when an artificial character is suddenly introduced to untangle a hopelessly contrived plot. Looking back for clues to the involvement of this character you realize that there are none and that the writers have intentionally kept the audience ignorant, a cheap way to surprise the viewer, the drawback being that the technique makes it impossible to inject even the tiniest bit of suspense into the viewing process. What clues there are were inserted just to jerk the viewer around.They cheat again with another of those stupid villain resurrection fight sequences at the very end. You know this tired stuff, show evidence that the villain could not possibly have escaped then have him Jason-like magically surface alive and kicking. The sad part being that it doesn't work (which must have been obvious during the editing process), it is totally unnecessary, and it could have been seamlessly trimmed out during post-production. Lose those moronic 20 seconds and you could add about 10 IQ points to the target audience.That said, it is otherwise an entertaining film. Bruce Willis plays a trouble-making Pittsburgh cop named Hardy and.... big surprise.... he's unpopular with the department brass. He is demoted and paired with Sarah Jessica Parker patrolling the three rivers for the River Rescue Squad. Their romance is predictable but the chemistry is good and the relationship has a nice low-key charm. The river patrol provides an opportunity to stage some nice 1940's style action and chase scenes. Hardy is very easy to identify with so you can get a nice vicarious rush from his point-of-view.Hardy is unpopular because he testified against his first partner in a police brutality case,  because he insists that a serial killer is still at large, and that only someone on the force could be the serial killer. So mystery #1 is the identity of the serial killer. Mystery #2 is who killed Hardy's father (a police Captain) about the same time as the first round of serial killings. . His uncle (Dennis Farina) is on the force, and at one time so were two of his uncle's sons, Hardy's cousins and childhood friends. Not much is revealed about them because doing so would require a much more intelligent screenplay. One seems to be a violent nut case so you know he could not possibly be involved in the killings.Roger Ebert summed it all up nicely in a template: ""A rebel cop stirs up trouble and is disciplined, but determines to stay on the trail of a serial killer, while meanwhile he is assigned a partner that first he hates and then he likes, while the killer cleverly tries to frame him. Add several chase scenes and a deadly confrontation in which all of the key characters magically congregate at the same time.""Then again, what do I know?
