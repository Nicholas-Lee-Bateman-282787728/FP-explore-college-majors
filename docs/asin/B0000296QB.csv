But for all that I enjoyed it. The character costumes are well drawn and the characters themselves have potential. Each one has different skills. The heroes look cool and the gals sexy. The action is well done. It is worth a watch, as the series was dropped I am not sure if it is worth buying.",4,Potential aplenty,1003968000,"10 25, 2001",2001,403,"['pity', 'series', 'was', 'not', 'completed', 'problems', 'times', 'rather', 'anime', 'cliche', 'enjoyed', 'character', 'costumes', 'are', 'well', 'drawn', 'characters', 'have', 'potential', 'one', 'different', 'skills', 'heroes', 'look', 'cool', 'gals', 'sexy', 'action', 'well', 'done', 'watch', 'series', 'was', 'dropped', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'worth', 'buying']",N/A

The fact that there's only 2 episodes gives me two things to look at.#1. It's not worth getting since the series was discontinued.#2. It still has potential of being a good series if they do continue it. In which case I would buy a box set of the whole series.The story was some-what interesting, but I warn you, you'll hate the dubbing voices if you're not a 12-year old kid. The guy that asked what language I wanted played the DVD as I was deciding, and when I heard Sakura yell out something in the English voice at the start-up, I immediately said, &quot;That sounds so annoying! Japanese please!&quot;Overall, if they continue the series it may turn out to be good, but you can't judge it so far since it's only 2 episodes.",3,It was ok,993513600,"06 26, 2001",2001,910,"['was', 'mostly', 'interested', 'seeing', 'anime', 'based', 'RPG', 'character', 'picture', 'character', 'whom', 'had', 'never', 'actually', 'seen', 'action', '1', '1/2', 'years', 'later', 'fact', 'only', '2', 'episodes', 'two', 'things', 'look', 'at.', '1', 'not', 'worth', 'getting', 'series', 'was', 'discontinued.', '2', 'still', 'potential', 'being', 'good', 'series', 'do', 'continue', 'case', 'would', 'buy', 'box', 'set', 'whole', 'series.The', 'story', 'was', 'some-what', 'interesting', 'warn', ""'ll"", 'hate', 'dubbing', 'voices', ""'re"", 'not', '12-year', 'old', 'kid', 'guy', 'asked', 'what', 'language', 'wanted', 'played', 'DVD', 'was', 'deciding', 'when', 'heard', 'Sakura', 'out', 'something', 'English', 'voice', 'start-up', 'immediately', 'said', 'quot', 'so', 'annoying', 'Japanese', 'please', 'quot', 'Overall', 'continue', 'series', 'may', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'judge', 'so', 'far', 'only', '2', 'episodes']",N/A
514033,A1RGM9SNWWMJS2,B0000296QB,Chris Meichtry,"[8, 10]","This is the first DVD I ever bought.  I for one, think I made a good choice.  Ninja cadets is filled with gore and violence.  It also has a comedy feel to it.  I guess you could say it's a cross between Ninja Scroll  and Tenchi Muyo!.  You follow along with Sakura, Pochi, Matsuri, Hayashi,  Yume, and Kaoru on their mission to steal a secret scroll from Byakuro  Castle.  Most of the movie is filled with action, so don't worry about  becomming bored.  If the jokes aren't funny enough for you, check out the  bloopers.  Other cool features are: Art Gallery, Scene Access, English or  Japanese version, optional subtitles, and about fifteen cool trailors.  I  hope Youmex will make more episodes of this wonderfull anime.  I highly  recommend Ninja Cadets.",5,"It's like Ninja Scroll, but funnier",962668800,"07 4, 2000",2000,757,"['first', 'DVD', 'ever', 'bought', 'one', 'think', 'made', 'good', 'choice', 'Ninja', 'cadets', 'filled', 'gore', 'violence', 'also', 'comedy', 'feel', 'guess', 'could', 'say', 'cross', 'Ninja', 'Scroll', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'follow', 'along', 'Sakura', 'Pochi', 'Matsuri', 'Hayashi', 'Yume', 'Kaoru', 'mission', 'steal', 'secret', 'scroll', 'Byakuro', 'Castle', 'Most', 'movie', 'filled', 'action', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'becomming', 'bored', 'jokes', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny', 'enough', 'check', 'out', 'bloopers', 'Other', 'cool', 'features', 'are', 'Art', 'Gallery', 'Scene', 'Access', 'English', 'Japanese', 'version', 'optional', 'subtitles', 'fifteen', 'cool', 'trailors', 'hope', 'Youmex', 'will', 'make', 'more', 'episodes', 'wonderfull', 'anime', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Ninja', 'Cadets']",N/A

I loved the movie so much that after owning it on VHS for so many years, I quickly bought it on DVD when it became available. You see, for me, most japanese anime are instantly forgettable after you first watch them, or don't seem to hold up very well ""story-wise"" when dubbed for an american market. But NINJA CADETS scores well in all categories.For me, I really wanted for this pretty cool series to continue on as a hit television show or maybe it could've continued on as an action-packed series of sporadic two hour movies that progresses the NINJA CADETS story line along.It's a shame, too. There's a lot to love about NINJA CADETS! Man, this show could have been the ""NARUTO"" of the 1990's...Ahhhh, what could have been!",4,ONE OF MY FAVORITE ANIME'S OF ALL TIME!

514035,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0000296QB,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[3, 4]","Ninja Cadets! aka &quot;Ninja Mono&quot; in Japan is a story that combines the sword busting of Ninja Scroll with the wackiness of Tenchi Muyou.  My only problem with this DVD is that there are only two OAV's and that there  will be no more OAV's afterwards.  In other words, you are left with a  storyline that begs to have more afterwards.  You watch and enjoy the anime  but are left saying...I want to watch more!...but for now, there are no  plans for more.As for the video, the quality is really colorful and  the video, I'm guessing is only stereo because I didn't notice anything  major ala 5.1.The extras are pretty interesting with about 11 trailers  to other Media-Blasters anime releases and the outtakes are very fun to  watch.  Also, a 5-minute art gallery.  I hope Media-Blasters adds them to  all their DVD's.  My only problem is the dubbed voice when you enter each  menu.  It's very childlike and it's obviously the voice for Sakura but I  felt I was going to watch a children's animation and this anime is far from  that.I'm glad they offered the series both in dub and in original  Japanese with English subtitles for us purists.A good DVD but  disappointed that the story ended like it did with no future episodes  planned at this time.",4,Ninja Cadets DVD Review: 2 OAV's...that's it?

If I had to choose between Samurai: Hunt for the Sword andWrath of Ninja, I'd choose Wrath. If I were rich and had my way, I'd probably go with Ninja ScrollThe Movie&The Series - Ultimate Collection.But, for what it's worth, I wasn't a big fan of Ninja Cadets. The trailer I saw seemed to be better than the anime. I hoped for more. If you've seen one of the ""cinematic"" trailers, it's mostly from a short scene at the beginning. The rest seemed cartoonish, whiny and incomplete (almost like they hoped to turn it into a series, but never got that far; no resolution really, it just seems to end).
