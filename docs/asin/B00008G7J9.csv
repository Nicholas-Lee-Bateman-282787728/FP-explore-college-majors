Even without whatever extras might be featured on DVD this is a very worthy view. They take 5 families, some with kids, and they all must live by the rules of a different era for nearly a year, in an isolated area of Montana. So for a year, all these families, these people from the 21st century, must live like pioneers. They build cabins, dig outhouses, chop wood, plant and tend gardens, raise and harvest animals &amp; try not to starve to death. They can only go for supplies as time and money allows; these trips take a day each way and they shop at a recreated general store, only allowed to buy things possible to obtain in the 1800's. They follow them around with cameras, documenting their lives and struggles. Except for the cameras, everything else is pretty much authentically from the pioneer era. Also, perhaps best of all, in addition to the documenting cameras, each person involved is filmed in more private, confessional-type settings, and they often say whatever they want; personal opinions, feelings about other pioneer community members, all kinds of interesting things.The reasons I like this: It seems to unfold in a very real and natural way, never seems contrived. You get to see first hand, get a first-hand feeling of being there without becoming soiled personally, in a more detailed, more personal way than ever before, how it must have been for our brave pioneering forefathers. It gives you a better understanding and a bigger appreciation for aforementioned forefathers. You get deeply inside these people's lives for a year, feel almost acquainted with them. Like with any show or movie with many characters, you choose favorites, discover one or two with whom you can relate, yet by the end you like even those you at first were not fond of, at least a little. These families struggle and grow as we watch, some growth is in ways that we might imagine and that we could all likely benefit from, other growth is in ways none of us could really imagine, ways none of us in this century are prepared to deal with; all grow stronger in sense of individual strength and discipline, family connectivity, and community values.  You get to see these people transformed as you watch in the course of their year, and in some ways you are transformed right along with them. As they live for a year in the past, we watch as they struggle, squabble and form strong bonds with themselves and with one another. By the time they leave, even the worst enemies among them hug tearfully goodbye, and we are right there with them.In the end a panel of experts on the era come in and evaluate each family, rate their chances of survival if they really had been living in that time and had to live through the coming winter based on how they had done so far and how much they had prepared. These are the same experts who were consulted right along, and who set everything up authentically. Their final findings are surprising, and eye-opening.All in all an excellent view, which offers a little bit of everything. You get drama, comedy, suspense, some action. You get the struggles man faces when living in the wilderness, living as in an era gone by, trying to make it on his own, and all while trying to coexist in a small community not of his choosing or particular liking.Good stuff.",5,Little House On The Prairie meets Survivor,1075939200,"02 5, 2004",2004,3370,"['have', 'seen', 'series', 'must', 'confess', 'do', 'not', 'yet', 'own', 'DVD', 'Even', 'extras', 'might', 'be', 'featured', 'DVD', 'very', 'worthy', 'view', 'take', '5', 'families', 'kids', 'must', 'live', 'rules', 'different', 'era', 'nearly', 'year', 'isolated', 'area', 'Montana', 'So', 'year', 'families', 'people', '21st', 'century', 'must', 'live', 'pioneers', 'build', 'cabins', 'dig', 'outhouses', 'chop', 'wood', 'plant', 'tend', 'gardens', 'raise', 'harvest', 'animals', 'amp', 'not', 'starve', 'death', 'can', 'only', 'go', 'supplies', 'time', 'money', 'allows', 'trips', 'take', 'day', 'way', 'shop', 'recreated', 'general', 'store', 'only', 'allowed', 'buy', 'things', 'possible', 'obtain', '1800', 'follow', 'cameras', 'documenting', 'lives', 'struggles', 'cameras', 'everything', 'else', 'pretty', 'much', 'authentically', 'pioneer', 'era', 'Also', 'perhaps', 'best', 'addition', 'documenting', 'cameras', 'person', 'involved', 'filmed', 'more', 'private', 'confessional-type', 'settings', 'often', 'say', 'want', 'personal', 'opinions', 'feelings', 'other', 'pioneer', 'community', 'members', 'kinds', 'interesting', 'things.The', 'reasons', 'like', 'unfold', 'very', 'real', 'natural', 'way', 'never', 'contrived', 'get', 'see', 'first', 'hand', 'get', 'first-hand', 'feeling', 'being', 'becoming', 'soiled', 'personally', 'more', 'detailed', 'more', 'personal', 'way', 'ever', 'how', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'brave', 'pioneering', 'forefathers', 'better', 'understanding', 'bigger', 'appreciation', 'aforementioned', 'forefathers', 'get', 'deeply', 'people', 'lives', 'year', 'feel', 'almost', 'acquainted', 'show', 'movie', 'many', 'characters', 'choose', 'favorites', 'discover', 'one', 'two', 'whom', 'can', 'relate', 'yet', 'end', 'even', 'first', 'were', 'not', 'fond', 'least', 'little', 'families', 'struggle', 'grow', 'watch', 'growth', 'ways', 'might', 'imagine', 'could', 'all', 'likely', 'benefit', 'other', 'growth', 'ways', 'none', 'could', 'really', 'imagine', 'ways', 'none', 'century', 'are', 'prepared', 'deal', 'grow', 'stronger', 'sense', 'individual', 'strength', 'discipline', 'family', 'connectivity', 'community', 'values', 'get', 'see', 'people', 'transformed', 'watch', 'course', 'year', 'ways', 'are', 'transformed', 'right', 'live', 'year', 'past', 'watch', 'struggle', 'squabble', 'form', 'strong', 'bonds', 'one', 'time', 'leave', 'even', 'worst', 'enemies', 'hug', 'tearfully', 'goodbye', 'are', 'right', 'there', 'them.In', 'end', 'panel', 'experts', 'era', 'come', 'evaluate', 'family', 'rate', 'chances', 'survival', 'really', 'had', 'been', 'living', 'time', 'had', 'live', 'coming', 'winter', 'based', 'how', 'had', 'done', 'so', 'far', 'how', 'much', 'had', 'prepared', 'are', 'same', 'experts', 'who', 'were', 'consulted', 'right', 'along', 'who', 'set', 'everything', 'up', 'authentically', 'final', 'findings', 'are', 'surprising', 'eye-opening.All', 'excellent', 'view', 'little', 'bit', 'everything', 'get', 'drama', 'comedy', 'suspense', 'action', 'get', 'struggles', 'man', 'when', 'living', 'wilderness', 'living', 'era', 'gone', 'trying', 'make', 'own', 'trying', 'coexist', 'small', 'community', 'not', 'choosing', 'particular', 'liking.Good', 'stuff']",N/A

Sometimes their fights are with their neighbors, their families, or even within themselves.  It is remarkable to see how the families change during their stay in the Montana wilderness.  It is interesting to see the individual families follow the rules to their own interpretations.  It is difficult to review this without containing spoilers.

741762,AO7RFXGXSY3LN,B00008G7J9,"Amy Wallace ""Buttonsamy""","[46, 48]","I've seen all of the DVD's in PBS's The House series. Out of all of them, I'd say that Manor House and Frontier House are the best of them.Frontier House is pretty realistic in terms of the clothing, the setting and scenarios follow the lives of the original pioneers as closely as possible. Seeing modern day families try and relive that style of life is entertaining and highly engaing and educational. We forget how far we've come from those days in the past and how much we rely on modern day technology. My favorite example is TOILET PAPER!! Not only do these poor folks have to build their own outhouses, they have no toilet paper, only a small tin of water, some leaves or a small rag that has to be cleaned then reused. We forget how lucky we are to have indoor plumbing!Although the families are not the most engaging because they seem  reluctant to give up modern day conviniences and complain about the harsh lifestyle and hard work, you understand their struggles  and hardships. Watching these familes become more closely knit and work as a team is facinating, and shows just how hard our pioneer ancestors struggles to build lives for themselves.As the show progresses, we watch new challenges arise, such as running out of food, dealing with livestock, building log cabins and other buildings such as outhouses and chicken coops. Learning how to slaughter and butcher animals is another task that has to be mastered, along with learning to farm.PBS did a wonderful thing introducing this series of ""time travel"" shows. Not only do we learn about different periods in history, but we learn how modern day people interact and live in these settings. These are wonderful to watch with your family and children, and would be great in a classroom setting.",5,Covered wagons and log cabins,1154563200,"08 3, 2006",2006,1765,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'DVD', 'PBS', 'House', 'series', ""'d"", 'say', 'Manor', 'House', 'Frontier', 'House', 'are', 'best', 'them.Frontier', 'House', 'pretty', 'realistic', 'terms', 'clothing', 'setting', 'scenarios', 'follow', 'lives', 'original', 'pioneers', 'as', 'closely', 'possible', 'Seeing', 'modern', 'day', 'families', 'try', 'relive', 'style', 'life', 'entertaining', 'highly', 'engaing', 'educational', 'forget', 'how', 'far', ""'ve"", 'come', 'days', 'past', 'how', 'much', 'rely', 'modern', 'day', 'technology', 'favorite', 'example', 'TOILET', 'PAPER', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'poor', 'folks', 'have', 'build', 'own', 'outhouses', 'have', 'toilet', 'paper', 'only', 'small', 'tin', 'water', 'leaves', 'small', 'rag', 'be', 'cleaned', 'then', 'reused', 'forget', 'how', 'lucky', 'are', 'have', 'indoor', 'plumbing', 'families', 'are', 'not', 'most', 'engaging', 'seem', 'reluctant', 'give', 'up', 'modern', 'day', 'conviniences', 'complain', 'harsh', 'lifestyle', 'hard', 'work', 'understand', 'struggles', 'hardships', 'Watching', 'familes', 'become', 'more', 'closely', 'knit', 'work', 'team', 'facinating', 'just', 'how', 'hard', 'pioneer', 'ancestors', 'build', 'lives', 'show', 'watch', 'new', 'challenges', 'arise', 'such', 'running', 'food', 'dealing', 'livestock', 'building', 'log', 'cabins', 'other', 'buildings', 'such', 'outhouses', 'chicken', 'coops', 'Learning', 'how', 'slaughter', 'butcher', 'animals', 'task', 'be', 'mastered', 'learning', 'farm.PBS', 'did', 'wonderful', 'thing', 'introducing', 'series', 'time', 'travel', 'shows', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'learn', 'different', 'periods', 'history', 'learn', 'how', 'modern', 'day', 'people', 'interact', 'live', 'settings', 'are', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'family', 'children', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'classroom', 'setting']",N/A

The quality and workmanship that went into the production of this video was incredible. The scenery was as good as it gets. The attention to historical detail was almost obsessive. There was a good balance between the technical aspects of living in the 1880s and the way that the different individuals adapted to the demands of their new environment. The discussion of social issues of the time was also strong. A lot of effort went into creating an authentic depiction of the life of homesteaders in Montana in the 1880s.

741765,A1AC9S8U66SNMU,B00008G7J9,Buenoslibros.es,"[4, 8]","The most important thing about this type of experiment (the House series, and this is obviously the best one) is the interactions of the family members, to find out what is the basis of a family, what are more exactly the roles we members (male, female, child, adult) have to play. It is absolutely not (even if from the producer's point of view it may be) to see how we, modern day city slickers can make it in an 1883 Montana environment. At least not for me. I don't care for that: lack of comforts, no tv, no refrigerator, no shower, no shampoo... so what? you can go on a mission trip to Per&uacute; today for that.But when it comes to surviving, physically, and there's a wife and kids involved that depend on you, what do you do Mr.? Do you decide to play the role of the old-fashioned head of the family, and risk being labeled 'machista' by the feminists (like the 2 times married lady in the episode)? Or would you compromise, or what? Of course you could do no more than what your wife permits; and that's the trick that makes it so interesting. How would you, ladies, take your role? When it comes to surviving, would you give up feminist quarrels just as you would have to give up your make up? The film shows us pretty clear that it was rougher for the females. The males loved it, pure and simple.Another great thing about this is that we witness three very different families, by the way they interact, and the way they see  their own roles as members of the family.The question therefore is not: would they have made it through the winter? But... Would they have made it as a family? And the answer differs. One family is much stronger, from the wife and husband to the kids. Another, since they have no kids and have just got married, plays no significant role in this experiment. And the third comes out broken. If they ever thought they were a family their view must have broken into pieces like a shattered glass. They did not know how to function as a family because they (and I leave it to the viewer to put the names) took their 21st century notions of family with them. Sad, to see at the end each one living separately after all they had to go through. And their kids did not get a positive impression from their adults either.Moral: You'd better know well before you marry a woman with two kids. Oh, and the landscapes are gorgeous.

My god, the Clunes --- everyone I knew who watched this had pretty much the same thing to say about them.  Rich, priviledged and delusional, the Clunes drove us all crazy with their whining and self-serving rationalizations.  They were like a car accident --- they sickened you, but you couldn't help but watch them.Watching the Glenns on the other hand was pure agony, as you witnessed the disintegration of a marriage that appeared to be cracking up even before the Frontier House experiment.  Although they proved to quite equal to the task (the Clunes, by contrast, would have had to resort to cannibalism to survive the winter), the Glenns might have ended up killing each other somewhere along the way.  I suspect that the Glenns, unfortunately, depicted all too accurately many a domestic situation on the historical frontier.If you have photographs of your 19th-century ancestors, particularly those who were sod-busters, take a good look at those faces.  They are the faces of weathered, hardened people who have looked adversity in the face.  Watching this series will make you understand why they looked so hardened.

741767,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,B00008G7J9,Chris Luallen,"[4, 4]","This series features six hour long episodes involving three 21st century families attempting to live as homesteaders in the Montana Territory of 1883. Historically speaking, the original homesteader families were required to farm the land for 5 years in order to gain ownership. But in ""Frontier House"" the families are only here for 6 months, with the major goal being to become prepared to survive the upcoming winter. In the end, the relative success or failure of each family is evaluated by a group of historical experts.The Clunes are a wealthy family of six from California. They definitely  come across as the least likable family. Gordon is an arrogant jerk who attempts to disrupt the authenticity of the project through various forms of ""cheating"". His wife whines about not being able to wear makeup and the kids are rather spoiled. But still I do have to give the family credit for toughing it out for the entire six months instead of quitting the project altogether. The wife and two teenage girls clearly don't want to be there. But even they admit, after coming home to California, that participating in this project did help them to become better people and to have more appreciation for the luxuries of modern life.The Glenns are a middle class family from Pleasant View, Tennessee, just 10 miles down the road from where I now live. They have more of a background in ""country living"" and are generally more successful in adapting to the frontier than are the Clunes. Karen is an extraordinarily determined woman with a strong personality. Mark seems dissatisfied in his role as step father and there is alot conflict between Karen and he. But, unlike some other reviewers, I saw Mark as a basically decent guy. He clearly loves the frontier lifestyle and works very hard to keep things going. I think he and Karen just have incompatiable personalities. The Glenn kids are terrific, doing a great job with the animals and never complaining about the modern conviences they have to do without.Nate Brooks is a great guy and it is terrific to see he and his father bonding so intensely while working together to build a cabin for Nate's fiancee, Kristen, who is arriving from Boston. The episode that ended with the wedding of Nate and Kristen is excellent. But afterwards it becomes evident that Kristen is a ""city girl"" who is not really prepared to endure the hardships of frontier life, especially her ""woman's role"" assigned tasks of cooking and cleaning. Still Nate keeps a great attitude throughout and even tries to serve as a peacemaker between the feuding Glenns and Clunes.This is a terrific series, both entertaining and educational.

741770,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,B00008G7J9,Elisabeth,"[1, 2]","The film follows 3 families -- The Clunes, The Glenns, and The Brooks -- as they live the frontier life as it would have been in 1883.  If these families had any romantic notions that frontier life would resemble Little House on the Prairie, they're quickly shattered.  It's backbreaking labor, monotonous chores, and kids are put to work early with little playtime left over.  There's also livestock to watch over, bears to contend with, and harsh winters that demand early preparation or else you wouldn't survive them.The 3 families cope in different ways, which causes friction between the Glenns and the Clunes.  The Glenns are hard workers who believe in following the rules.  The Clunes, in contrast, look for the easy way out and if that means breaking rules, so be it.  That mindset is especially exasperating to Karen Glenns and myself, too.From the beginning, the Clunes break rules.  First they smuggle in makeup and modern day toiletries.  They eventually fess up to smuggling and part with their modern day conveniences, but not without Mrs. Clune crying over not being allowed makeup.  Later on, they once again break the rules by breaking the laws of that time.  Mr. Clune defends his unethical behavior proudly with his wife also smiling proudly up at him, too.Karen, in the meantime, wonders why the Clunes bothered participating in an authentic, historical experiment if they're just going to modernize the experience.  I wondered this, too.  There were many times when Karen voiced my thoughts aloud.However, I did also sense a competitive side to Karen, too.  She later fesses up to that, though, which I thought demonstrated good character and self-awareness.Instead of focusing so much on the Clunes, Karen probably should've focused more on her marriage, which slowly unravels during this 5 month stay.  Going in, their marriage seemed shaky and then adding a stressful pioneer life widened the cracks.  Even without this added stresser, though, husband Mark Glenn had unrealistic and unfair expectations of their marriage, especially concerning her kids from a previous marriage.The bright light among all this bickering were the Brooks.  The show starts out with Nate and his father, and then later, his father leaves and is replaced with Nate's fiance Kristen.Nate is a remarkable human being.  He starts the show drawing the short end of the stick, being penniless and having to start his home from scratch....yet, he never complains about his misfortune and instead, remains focused on the work ahead with a positive attitude throughout.  I wish more people had his work ethic.  He also makes wise, well thought out decisions like picking the right livestock and harvesting more hay than necessary, knowing there'd be a demand for it later.As with previous House series, a narrator informs the audience what homesteading life of 1883 was really like.  I found this very informative and appreciated the attention to detail.However, I should point out one detail that might bother some.  It's the killing of livestock, which they show.  I couldn't stomach watching roosters getting killed or a pig being shot between the eyes, so in these parts only, I hit the mute button and looked away.I sympathized with Karen's son who had grown attached to the livestock and was heartbroken when they were killed.  Even more heartbreaking was when he turned to his mom for comfort and was told to toughen up instead.At the end of the show, the families move back to their modern day world and are interviewed one last time to compare the homestead life to modern day life.  I was fascinated listening to these differences.  The families also get the results telling them if they would've survived the winter or not, based on how much prep they did.The Frontier House is fascinating to watch on three levels.  On one level, it's learning how life was really like on the homestead.  On another level, it's watching how humans react to each other in close quarters and what decisions they make to survive.  And on another level, it's taking a moment to examine our modern day life and challenging our beliefs that bigger and faster are always better.",4,The hardships and drama of pioner life,1312848000,"08 9, 2011",2011,4163,"['film', '3', 'families', 'Clunes', 'Glenns', 'Brooks', 'live', 'frontier', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'been', '1883', 'families', 'had', 'romantic', 'notions', 'frontier', 'life', 'would', 'resemble', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie', ""'re"", 'quickly', 'shattered', 'backbreaking', 'labor', 'monotonous', 'chores', 'kids', 'are', 'put', 'work', 'early', 'little', 'playtime', 'left', 'over', 'also', 'livestock', 'watch', 'bears', 'contend', 'harsh', 'winters', 'demand', 'early', 'preparation', 'else', 'would', ""n't"", 'survive', 'them.The', '3', 'families', 'cope', 'different', 'ways', 'friction', 'Glenns', 'Clunes', 'Glenns', 'are', 'hard', 'workers', 'who', 'believe', 'following', 'rules', 'Clunes', 'contrast', 'look', 'easy', 'way', 'breaking', 'rules', 'so', 'be', 'mindset', 'especially', 'exasperating', 'Karen', 'Glenns', 'beginning', 'Clunes', 'break', 'rules', 'First', 'smuggle', 'makeup', 'modern', 'day', 'toiletries', 'eventually', 'fess', 'up', 'smuggling', 'part', 'modern', 'day', 'conveniences', 'not', 'Mrs.', 'Clune', 'crying', 'not', 'being', 'allowed', 'makeup', 'Later', 'once', 'again', 'break', 'rules', 'breaking', 'laws', 'time', 'Mr.', 'Clune', 'unethical', 'behavior', 'proudly', 'wife', 'also', 'smiling', 'proudly', 'up', 'too.Karen', 'meantime', 'wonders', 'why', 'Clunes', 'bothered', 'participating', 'authentic', 'historical', 'experiment', ""'re"", 'just', 'going', 'modernize', 'experience', 'wondered', 'too', 'were', 'many', 'times', 'when', 'Karen', 'voiced', 'thoughts', 'aloud.However', 'did', 'also', 'sense', 'competitive', 'side', 'Karen', 'too', 'later', 'up', 'thought', 'demonstrated', 'good', 'character', 'self-awareness.Instead', 'focusing', 'so', 'much', 'Clunes', 'Karen', 'probably', 'should', ""'ve"", 'focused', 'more', 'marriage', 'slowly', '5', 'month', 'stay', 'Going', 'marriage', 'seemed', 'shaky', 'then', 'adding', 'stressful', 'pioneer', 'life', 'widened', 'cracks', 'Even', 'added', 'stresser', 'though', 'husband', 'Mark', 'Glenn', 'had', 'unrealistic', 'unfair', 'expectations', 'marriage', 'especially', 'concerning', 'kids', 'previous', 'marriage.The', 'bright', 'light', 'bickering', 'were', 'Brooks', 'show', 'out', 'Nate', 'father', 'then', 'later', 'father', 'leaves', 'replaced', 'Nate', 'fiance', 'Kristen.Nate', 'remarkable', 'human', 'being', 'show', 'drawing', 'short', 'end', 'stick', 'being', 'penniless', 'having', 'start', 'home', 'scratch', '.yet', 'never', 'misfortune', 'instead', 'focused', 'work', 'ahead', 'positive', 'attitude', 'wish', 'more', 'people', 'had', 'work', 'ethic', 'also', 'wise', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'decisions', 'picking', 'right', 'livestock', 'harvesting', 'more', 'hay', 'necessary', 'knowing', ""'d"", 'be', 'demand', 'previous', 'House', 'series', 'narrator', 'audience', 'what', 'homesteading', 'life', '1883', 'was', 'really', 'like', 'found', 'very', 'informative', 'appreciated', 'attention', 'detail.However', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'one', 'detail', 'might', 'bother', 'killing', 'livestock', 'show', 'could', ""n't"", 'stomach', 'watching', 'roosters', 'getting', 'killed', 'pig', 'being', 'shot', 'eyes', 'so', 'parts', 'only', 'hit', 'mute', 'button', 'looked', 'away.I', 'sympathized', 'Karen', 'son', 'who', 'had', 'grown', 'attached', 'livestock', 'was', 'heartbroken', 'when', 'were', 'killed', 'Even', 'more', 'heartbreaking', 'was', 'when', 'turned', 'mom', 'comfort', 'was', 'told', 'toughen', 'up', 'instead.At', 'end', 'show', 'families', 'move', 'back', 'modern', 'day', 'world', 'are', 'interviewed', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'compare', 'homestead', 'life', 'modern', 'day', 'life', 'was', 'fascinated', 'listening', 'differences', 'families', 'also', 'get', 'results', 'telling', 'would', ""'ve"", 'survived', 'winter', 'not', 'based', 'how', 'much', 'prep', 'did.The', 'Frontier', 'House', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'three', 'levels', 'one', 'level', 'learning', 'how', 'life', 'was', 'really', 'like', 'homestead', 'level', 'watching', 'how', 'humans', 'react', 'other', 'close', 'quarters', 'what', 'decisions', 'make', 'survive', 'level', 'taking', 'moment', 'examine', 'modern', 'day', 'life', 'challenging', 'beliefs', 'bigger', 'faster', 'are', 'always', 'better']",N/A

However, through reruns on PBS and GAC (Great American Country) channel which I taped off TV, I was eventually able to see this series in its entirety.""Frontier House"" follows three families consisting of the wealthy Clune family from Malibu, California, and the middle-class Glenn family from Tennessee & Brooks family from Massachusetts as they spend five months on the ""Montana frontier"" during the spring, summer and fall (autumn) of 2001.The Clune family consisted of Gordon (age 40), the owner of an aerospace and defense manufacturing firm, his wife, Adrienne (age 39), their daughter, Aine (age 14), son, Justin (age 12), son Conor (age 8) and Gordon's niece, Tracy (age 15). The Glenn family consisted of Mark (age 45), the chair of the department of medical and pharmacy technology at Draughons Junior College in Nashville, Tennessee, his wife Karen (age 36), a school nurse, and her two children from a previous marriage/relationship, daughter Erinn Patton (age 12), and son Logan Patton (age 8). Finally, the Brooks family consisted of Nate Brooks (age 27), a student activities coordinator, his fiance&eacute;, Kristen McLeod (age 27) a social worker, and for the first 3 episodes of the series, Nate's father Rudy (age 68). Rudy was not originally intended to be part of the series. He was brought in on the show only at the last moment, leaving his wife behind in Massachusetts. Kristen joined Nate and Rudy in the third episode of the show, at which point Nate and Kristen were married and Rudy left the series & returned home.The participants spent two weeks in classrooms and kitchens, learning about the history of the period and gaining expertise in animal husbandry, carpentry, chopping wood, clothes washing, cooking, farming, gardening, harvesting skills, personal hygiene (without the use of toilet paper), sewing, soap making, and other skills which the average person in 1880s Montana would have known. The participants spent their days learning skills in Virginia City, Montana--a restored ghost town, open air museum, and National Historic Landmark, and agreed to abide by a set of rules, which included the following:** Wearing period-appropriate clothing.** Preparing and eating period-appropriate food.** Using period-appropriate equipment, and using it in period-appropriate ways.** Communicating with the outside world (including series consultants) only through the postal service at the remote country store, or via telegraph.** Buying initial goods and supplies based on a period-appropriate budget set by series consultants, and then using the barter system during occasional visits to the country store.** Using only period-appropriate medicines. (For a serious medical emergency, participants could talk to a member of the production staff and seek the assistance of the show's physician.)BEFORE I saw ""Frontier House"", I really thought I would LOVE it, and was all prepared to give it 5 stars and a glowing review. Because as I'm not only a history buff with an especially deep interest in the pioneer/frontier (as well as the Holocaust) era but ALSO I'm an extremely strong supporter of the ""back-to-the-land"" movement, and very interested in homesteading, organic & eco-friendly ""green"" living, small-scale farming, alternative energy and living ""off-the-grid"" and as close to the land and nature as possible, I &#9829; the premise of this PBS ""reality TV"" series in which modern, 21st century families, move to homesteads in Montana to live under 19th century rules & standards (as if it really was the 1880s instead of 2001) and see how they'd fare (and, in particular, if they'd amassed enough food for themselves & their livestock, and enough firewood/fuel for heat, to last & survive through the winter) if they'd been pioneers living & homesteading ""on the frontier"".However, thoughFrontier Houseis definitely a THOUSAND TIMES better than the other ""reality show"" crap on TV over the past decade or two or so, unfortunately, for the most part, this show was still a HUGE letdown! :(First and foremost, while this PBS ""reality TV"" series claims to be true to history, in all honesty, it is SELECTIVE history! While everyone gripes about the Clune family's ""bending of the rules"" from what I've seen, NOBODY bothers to criticize how the show only follows (or NOT follows!) the rules/customs/standards of the 1880s only AS & WHEN IT SUITS THEM!!!!!!!For example, they are so busy obsessing over how to prevent the teenage Clune girls from using forbidden makeup or modern personal care products or Mrs Clune from bartering/trading with neighbors for extra provisions (which in fact has been quite common throughout history -- including & especially in the 19th century. Its only been in the past 50-100 years, since industrialization & corporatization, that bartering/trading became less common, though recently it has been making a comeback with Craigslist, online bartering websites and local barter networks) by claiming that it ""brings the modern conveniences of the 21st century into the 1880s"" -- and meanwhile, in such blatant hypocrisy, they have no problem bringing the modern world into the 19th century by so cowardly abdicating the participants freedom & liberty and meekly following the fascist, corporate-backed, profit-driven ""nanny state"" 21st century laws prohibiting or restricting hunting & fishing (which people were FREELY able to do in the 1880s) instead of  just filming the series in an area, and/or time of the year when hunting & fishing are allowed, or even challenging the Constitutionality of laws banning or limiting hunting & fishing. Because the fact is,  that in the era BEFORE supermarkets (likeWalmart), BEFORE pizza delivery, and BEFORE drive-through fast-food joints, frozen TV dinners, pre-packaged ramen noodles & other ""food"", when the majority of people were living ON the land and feeding (and even clothing) themselves from the fruits of their land & their labor, people used to HUNT & FISH for their food. That is a simple fact dating back to the hunter-gatherers of the Paleolithic times. They did not drive to the nearestWalmartto pick up a couple pounds of ground chuck wrapped in plastic on a styrofoam tray, derived from one of THOUSANDS of sick & diseased grain-fed (cows should be ONLY pasture-raised & grass-fed) cows in a filthy Big Ag ""factory farm"" hundreds or thousands of miles away. No, they took a fishing rod or a stick, or a fishing spear & net and went caught their meal or they took a bow & arrow, or their shotgun or rifle, and went hunting for bear, or buffalo, or elk, or deer, or rabbits or wild turkeys or whatever!Yet the producers of ""Frontier House"" conveniently omit this aspect of history, by claiming that the modern laws prohibit hunting, when they very well could have just chosen to film in a location and/or time of the year when hunting IS allowed. Not only do they use the fascist ""nanny-state"" 21st century laws as an excuse, but I also read that the producers refused to allow the participants to hunt on the show because they were worried about the safety issues of giving the participants access to weapons -- which is another ridiculous & laughable excuse considering that in the 1880s, especially living on the frontier, PEOPLE HAD WEAPONS!They had weapons to hunt for food, and they had weapons for self-defense and defense of their home/property and family from wild animals or occasionally unwanted human intruders (its not exactly like they could call 911 in those days, and have armed police there within seconds or even minutes!) and people were taught from a very young age about proper respect for weapons. Often they made even made their own ammunition from hand (like in theLittle House in the Big Woodsbook in theThe Little House on the Prairieseries by Laura Ingalls Wilder) and learned almost from the cradle, that guns and other weapons are not a toy, but a tool for survival, especially on the frontier.If the creators ofFrontier Housewere really true to history, they would teach the participants about the historical period-appropriate weapons & weapon safety -- the SAME WAY that they gave them classes in animal husbandry, and farming, and sewing and making soap, and candles, and other skills/tasks common & often necessary for survival in the 19th century................AND THEN give them period-appropriate hunting weapons (meaning no modern automatic assault weapons, or the like!) and allow them to hunt like they would have been free to do in the 1880s!Unfortunately, the ban on hunting was far from the only inaccuracy in this series. For example, in one episode, Tracy Clune, the 15 year old niece of Gordon & Adrienne Clune, was experiencing intense homesickness, so the producers brought Tracy's parents for a visit -- and in another episode, the producers bring Karen Glenn's mother to visit for Logan's 9th birthday celebration. NONE of that would have ever happened, or, at the least, it would've been very unlikely, had it actually happened in the 1880s! In those days, traveling by covered wagon to frontier homesteads took days or weeks, if not MONTHS! So pioneer families who moved West, rarely (if ever!) saw their relatives again after they left, or at least, not for years at a time. The only communication homesteaders had with those living elsewhere was postal mail which took weeks or months to arrive. Meaning that if it were really 1880s Montana, and Tracy was feeling homesick or Logan wanted Grandma to visit for his birthday, their only option would be to write a letter -- and if they wrote it in the spring, then, the earliest the recipients would get it would be sometime in summer or fall, and even if they (Tracy's parents & Logan's grandmother) replied right away, Tracy & Logan still wouldn't get those response letters until the next spring. Or even if Tracy's parents & Logan's grandmother immediately decided to visit Tracy & Logan (which itself would be highly improbable!) since they would not be able to travel by covered wagon during winter, by the time they got Tracy & Logan's letters, it would be too late in the year for them to leave, and they'd have to wait until early the next spring (like April) and they wouldn't reach the homesteads until the following fall!So if these producers of the show were really ""true to history"", they would let the modern 21st century families FULLY EXPERIENCE the feelings of homesickness for the 5 months of filming, especially since the real homesteaders had no choice but to just endure it -- and for YEARS at a time, with NO ""quick fixes"" (such as allowing Tracy's parents and Logan's grandmother to come for a visit). In 1880s Montana, if homesteaders were homesick and missing their Mom & Dad or their Grandma, there'd be NOTHING they could do about it, other than suffer while still going on with their lives & their chores, responsibilities and activities of day-to-day living-- as in those days, putting Mom & Dad or Grandma on a Boeing 747 jet airplane & flying them in for a couple days visit, wasn't yet even considered to be in the realm of possibility! In those days it took weeks, even months to travel across the country by covered wagon, and even traveling by train (which was often too expensive for the average person) took days at a time, so people couldn't just drop by for a quick trip -- if they ever even came to visit, they'd stay for months, or at the least, they'd usually arrive in summer or fall and stay through the winter and then leave the following spring when it was possible to travel again. So the quick visits by Tracy's parents and Logan's grandmother is yet another hypocritical (along with the ban on hunting) and blatant departure from historical accuracy & reality on ""Frontier House""!Also, with a few exceptions (the Brooks family, the Clune children, and occasionally, the Glenn/Patton children, Erinn & Logan Patton) the rest of the characters were usually unbearably annoying!I suppose the producers thought that the competition & animosity between the characters, especially the rivalry between Gordon Clune & Karen Glenn, and the marital discord between Mark & Karen Glenn (who eventually divorced very soon after the show -- as ultimately, also did Gordon & Adrienne Clune who divorced several years later) would be enjoyable to 21st century viewers who've gone completely brain-dead from constantly (even daily) being fed vapid ""reality TV"" media likeSurvivorandFear Factor. However, quite frankly, I thought the tension between the characters was not only an irritating turn-off, but not entirely true to history either. I mean, yes, of course there were conflicts & tensions between pioneers living on the frontier in the 1880s, but UNLIKE in this series, where the three families are no more than a 15 minute walk away from each other's homesteads, in those days, the pioneers often lived so far apart, that it would take HOURS to walk to the nearest neighbor.So if it were really the 1880s, the homesteaders would be too busy tending their fields, caring for their livestock, and cooking & cleaning to care (or even notice) what kind of mattress (sometime during the series, Gordon & Adrienne Clune snuck in a prohibited modern box-spring mattress) their neighbor was sleeping on, or whether forbidden makeup & personal care cosmetics were being used. They just did NOT have the time or opportunity to get in those kinds of quarrels -- and even when/if they DID get the chance to meet their ""neighbors"", they probably wouldn't have cared or even noticed if their neighbor was sleeping on a mattress of pure solid gold, because they were just so thankful for the companionship and a break from the loneliness and homesickness, living all alone on the frontier, separated from their relatives, and often even miles & miles from the nearest neighbor. Even the TV series ""Little House on the Prairie"" despite its many changes & dramatized storylines for television audiences (like the fact that UNLIKE in the TV series, in real-life, Mary Ingalls never got married or ran a blind school and the characters of Albert, Cassandra & James Ingalls never existed) was MORE realistic than ""Frontier House""! At least ""Little House on the Prairie"" showed Charles Ingalls (and other characters) going hunting for food from time to time!On the other hand, there were *some* entertaining scenes in ""Frontier House"". I really enjoyed seeing the kids (especially the Clune girls) and hearing their insightful thoughts about living as 19th century kids in a 21st century world.In other words, if you are looking for a semi-entertaining but factually erroneous, pseudo-educational ""reality TV"" show from PBS, then ""Frontier House"" is a better choice than ""Survivor"" or ""Fear Factor"". However, if you are looking for a truly educational show about the pioneer era, that is historically accurate, you'd be better off looking elsewhere, preferably in books about this period and staying AWAY fromFrontier House!!!!",3,Selective History! Should be Either ALL or NOTHING -- and NOT Just True to History ONLY As & When It Suits Them!!!!,1400889600,"05 24, 2014",2014,15202,"['first', 'saw', 'part', 'ofFrontier', 'Houseon', 'PBS', 'missed',

741778,AK2V1U8CZNQFS,B00008G7J9,"L. Skelton ""Learning Freak""","[3, 4]","This was an excellent show on how adults should NOT influence their children! The history and the lifestyle is PBS Gold as usual, but I wonder what the family decider-type-people were thinking when they picked these three! It wasn't really reality either because they didn't have to make it through even one week - or two weeks in the winter. I know people who live in Montana, and that's the hardest part of that beautiful state - winter lasts a long time.I agree with the reviewer who said the Homestead era was great for men, not so much for women. And I don't like admitting this at all, because I consider myself an independent and capable female. But, the females from the CA family made me embarrassed to be female. Really? You are going to live as a pioneer in the year (small clue here...) 1833!!! There's no make up! Also, who would pick a wealthy beyond measure family for this type of gig? At the end, when dad came out of his newly finished mansion overlooking the sea in Malibu - he just looked ridiculous. We just saw the type of life our ancestors lived - toughing life out and doing with what really mattered, and here comes Bob Bitchen who in reality lives in a house that just made him look like the puffed up, look-at-me, I make my own rules personality he truly is. Why did PBS allow this family to continue on when they cheated every single step of the way?? That's not right. And, teaching your kids how to make moonshine?? Really? People chide the Glenn's because of their breakdown in communication, but it's my opinion that the only reason the C. marriage is together, is because the wife is a total doormat to her husband. He is the KING and she follows him around like the newborn colt they decided to sell - because they didn't want to chop more hay for the animal's survival, and because he bought up the store because his family was ""starving"" and went into the red and had to step up and pay the bill. I can't stand liars. And cheaters - who know they're cheating - are the worst kind of liar. Pops just absolutely had to have his way. Which is why he didn't get along with Ms. Glenn. She is exactly like him.I felt sorry for the poor Glenn children. Watching their parents fight and argue and slap each other with words in the home is bad enough, but these kids witnessed the many arguments knowing this was ON CAMERA. Hello, mom and dad??? Who's the adult here? I hate to label people and places, but when I lived in the South, I saw the same type of behavior: gossip, gossip, gossip, but go to church every Wednesday and Sunday doncha know. And what is it with 21st century women? Especially the younger 20-something women?? Some of them need to step OFF of their men already! Why do these women feel the need to ride their husbands like Zorro - never letting them just...breathe!?! It's funny, the people pickers picked a family where the guy was a chauvenist with the most whiniest kids on this earth, to the family who has Mrs. Cravettes and won't leave her husband alone. He was kind of a bent fender anyways, and the remark about ""I should never have became a stepfather."" That was beyond not cool. Forget the separation dude, just get the divorce. That attitude should never be allowed around children already suffering from one marital breakup. And Karen could do to appreciate those children of hers. Those kids were the best kids out of all the youngsters on the show. They really lived the life and didn't complain. Even when they suffered losses common to the pioneer family in farming - they still didn't complain.The Brooks were by far the most entertaining - in a positive way. I learned so much from the way they loved each other and tried to be positive and get along. It was sad how lonely it was for them because the other two were acting like the Hatfields and the McCoys. But, I don't think it was fair to include a family that had no children with others who did. It was very much harder for the families with children - so much more work. But, it was tipping the scale a bit too much. Plus, the wife coming in two months into the project - was just too wierd. She didn't have to do much at all except cook and dishes. Her husband had already prepared the hardest work. But, it was sweet how she tried because she saw how badly he wanted the experience. And she did step up to the plate.Nice touches - Adrienne can cook! Her menus were fabulous looking. Because this was in 2001, they heard news of the Terrorist attack at the farms. Adrienne made a flag from scratch. I was a bit jealous because they were so sheltered out in the West with no electronics. They didn't have to experience the attack as the rest of us did. The Glenn children riding their horse to school and how well they took care of the animals. Just awesome. And last, but definitely the best: Mr. Brooks gets a white dress and beautiful veil for his bride.

741779,A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L,B00008G7J9,Michael Valdivielso,"[6, 6]","This is about people.  Summery - Three families - well two families and a family to be - are given two weeks training on how to live as 1883 settlers on the frontier for five months.  They have to use only items, tools, equipment from the time period and only have so much in supplies and credit at the general store.  It is amazing, wonderful, funny and, sometimes, sad.  They learned how to use the tools, they learned about cooking, animal care, keeping clean, building the houses and riding horses.  They found out that there was no toilet paper, no makeup and no tampons.I think, at first, people kind of attach themselves to one of the families.  I found myself leaning towards the Glenn Family.  They seem spirited and strong while the Clune Family seemed spoiled and complained A LOT.  But as I got to see how the Clune Family got together, used their resources, and, even in the harsh times, showed some humor I started to lean towards them.  Of course the Glenn Family also kind of imploded.  There is a thin line between micro-management and nit-picking.  Yes there was some cheating, breaking of the rules.  Or is it trading baked goods with the natives?The Brooks Family REALLY impressed me.  They were loving, supportive, even of the other families, seemed to take tiny, careful, steps in deciding how to expand their homestead and building up their resources.  It was a major event in their lives.  They really focused on the basics - food, their animals and their long term future.It was also interesting to see how the kids handled the problems of life on the frontier and how they kind of bonded during their last few weeks while in school.  It was also interesting to see them two months after it was all done.  The girls in the Clune Family, for example, seemed to be uncomfortable in their string bikinis while in front of the camera.  Had their old fashion outfits, which sometimes covered them from neck to ankle, awaken in them a sense of modestly?I don't want to say too much but the two DVDs, even without the extras in the form of special features, could be used in classes of history or even team management classes.Many of the reviews you have seen talk about the breaking of the rules and, frankly, I think you have to decide about that on your own.  Did the settlers have rules?  At least 19th Century settlers could hunt, which gave them a good supply of food, furs and skins to trade, and maybe a sense of protection that these modern settlers did not have.  Given, for example, deer skins and salted meat every few weeks, could they have focused more on chopping wood and bring in the hay?  Maybe?Would they have survived the winter?  If they had known they would be facing a winter would they have tried harder?  Worked together?  Eaten each other?

For example, in the last episode, during the evaluation, we learn that Adrienne Clune made curtains and pickled vegetables, yet we never see her do it. We are shown the home-made wire on one of the chicken coops (the Brooks'?) but we don't learn how the wire was made. Along a similar line, it would have been interesting to hear more about how they dealt with the sanitary conditions (or lack thereof). How did they brush their teeth? What did they use for dish detergent? How did the women feel about using sanitary belts?I also would have liked to know what happened to the homesteads after the end of the experiment, especially to the animals and the supplies the families had stored.Instead of focusing so much on the inter- and intra-family bickering, more time could have been spent explaining the evaluation of their winter preparations. It all seemed a bit rushed. - And speaking about bickering: it never became clear to me why the Glenns had such a hard time getting along (especially since they had it easiest of all the families insofar as they moved into an existing home).

With the success of 1900 House, a realty mini-series where one family was transported to the Victorian Era, executives decided to send three families to the frontier of Montana with only the supplies that families would have had in 1883. Meet The Clunes, The Brooks', and The Glenns. The Clunes are a wealthy family from California, accustomed to frequent business trips and luxury. The Brooks family begins with Nate and his father Rudy and ends with Nate and his new wife Kristen. They are a biracial family, which was not uncommon in the west at the time. The Glenns are a family of four from Tennessee with a domineering mother and and a passive stepfather.There are six hour-long episodes on two disks which include behind the scenes and making of featurettes. Since only one third of the families that ventured to the west survived the five years it took to win their land claims, it is interesting to speculate on which family would have been best suited for the task.The casting is great. The Clunes can be annoying because they are the most apt to cheat and then cover their tracks. However, they work hard and are a loving family. It is particularly interesting to see how the opinions of the two teenaged girls, Tracy and Aine, change over the course of the five months. The Glenns are arguementative with each other, mainly because of Karen Glenn's strong personality. She can provide interesting commentary though, which is often in direct contrast with the others'. Her children are fun to watch, although son Logan gets the most air time. The Brooks are filmed the least, possibly because they have the least amount of troubles. Nate is well adapted for the west, and his loving bride Kristen endures it to please him. They provide rational thought to the equation when the Clunes and the Glenns have their fights. The community becomes like a real family; the transition is believable because it is real.This miniseries documents a fascinating journey that proves that reality TV can be worthwhile.

Ms. Clune really starts the show off on the wrong foot with her belly-aching about makeup even before they hit the trail to go to their homesteads. The two teen girls also were very anachronistic. They wander around in the equivalent of underwear half the time, and refuse to participate in women's work. What's the point of joining a project like frontier house and then acting modern? I was embarrassed when they were dancing around at the fair towards the end in their chemises. I also thought stealing the mattress was a cheap trick.I liked the Glen family more and sympathized with the wife a great deal. Her husband was a loser and the moment he said he liked Karen but didn't want her kids, I felt he was a complete Jerk. I'd be asking for divorce right then. Karen was one tough Cookie, and I really respected her a great deal. I think Karen was a great character and would be like a frontier wife from those times.The only family I really liked were the Brooks, they were constantly upbeat and interesting.3 stars. Average.

This DvD is about three families that attempt to recreate a western experience on the frontier. While maintaing accuracy most the time I was very pleased to watch this series and was a little disappointed by how little they actually did do. There is much more that could have been done during this experiment. However none the less it did provide quite a bit of humor to me coming from a ranching family.",5,Excellent DVD,1362528000,"03 6, 2013",2013,486,"['Came', 'original', 'plastic', 'shipping', 'was', 'professionaly', 'done', 'harm', 'product', 'DvD', 'three', 'families', 'attempt', 'recreate', 'western', 'experience', 'frontier', 'maintaing', 'accuracy', 'most', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'watch', 'series', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'how', 'little', 'actually', 'did', 'do', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'experiment', 'However', 'less', 'did', 'provide', 'quite', 'bit', 'humor', 'coming', 'ranching', 'family']",N/A
