190879,A3JTRUALU7I8Y8,157362876X,old school movie lover,"[0, 0]","This is an 80's movie I had totally forgotten about.  I took a chance and purchased it ( at a very low price) and was not disappointed.  There's nothing new here and the pairing of Burt and Liza seemed very odd.  He playing a disgraced cop (nothing new for Burt during the 80's) and Liza playing a prostitute ( strange choice, but she pulls it off) who witnesses a murder of several cops.  She hires him to be her personal bodyguard and help solve the crime and The Odd Couple a la Burt and Liza begins.  He's very old fashioned and not willing to change and she's a bit annoying, talking all the time, trying to change him.  ( whether it's Liza or her character Della that's annoying is up to the viewer, but she does grow on you.) What I liked about this film is that it's your typical 80's cop action movie without too many annoying, confusing twists and no CGI crap.  The character's are likeable and the action scenes are fun and believable.  Also, the chemistry between Burt and LIza also grows on the viewer and you find yourself rooting for them.  Worth a view if you have 90 minutes and want some good 80's fun with Burt and Liza.",4,"Burt and LIza,very odd pairing, but somehow their chemistry works",1402790400,"06 15, 2014",2014,1139,"['80', 'movie', 'had', 'totally', 'forgotten', 'took', 'chance', 'purchased', 'very', 'low', 'price', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'nothing', 'new', 'here', 'pairing', 'Burt', 'Liza', 'seemed', 'very', 'odd', 'playing', 'disgraced', 'cop', 'nothing', 'new', 'Burt', '80', 'Liza', 'playing', 'prostitute', 'strange', 'choice', 'off', 'who', 'murder', 'several', 'cops', 'be', 'personal', 'bodyguard', 'help', 'solve', 'crime', 'Odd', 'Couple', 'la', 'Burt', 'Liza', 'very', 'old', 'fashioned', 'not', 'willing', 'change', 'bit', 'annoying', 'talking', 'time', 'trying', 'change', 'Liza', 'character', 'Della', 'annoying', 'viewer', 'grow', 'What', 'liked', 'film', 'typical', '80', 'cop', 'action', 'movie', 'too', 'many', 'annoying', 'confusing', 'twists', 'CGI', 'crap', 'character', 'are', 'likeable', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'fun', 'believable', 'Also', 'chemistry', 'Burt', 'LIza', 'also', 'viewer', 'find', 'rooting', 'view', 'have', '90', 'minutes', 'want', 'good', '80', 'fun', 'Burt', 'Liza']",N/A

190882,A30A5I8FG82M2E,157362876X,SpookyChick,"[4, 5]","This is a sadly overlooked minor classic from the '80s.  It bombed at the box office and has a horrible reputation.  The DVD is full frame and the transfer is a bit soft and speckled with dirt.  Ignore all that, sit back, and enjoy the ride!  Liza as a call girl?  She pulls it off with great panache, delivering the kind of lines you'd never think would come from her.  I've heard she looks back on accepting this role as a mistake - but hey, we are all usually our own worst critic.  This is a class act all the way.  And Burt?  Well, he's the Burt we all know and love - he seems a bit non-committed to the role, but isn't that part of his charm?  His late-90s/early-00s comeback was still a decade away, when he would rock the critics with fab supporting turns in ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Driven.""  Even though many years have passed, I would love to see Burt reprise his role as Church - get him and Liza together again!  Now be forewarned, there are some very dated elements to this movie (not the least of which being a cheesy '80s score).  But if you are in the mood for a slightly comic, mostly tense and suspenseful, cop movie - you cannot go wrong with Rent-a-Cop.
