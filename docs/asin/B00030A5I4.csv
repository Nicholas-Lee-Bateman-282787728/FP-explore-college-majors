854246,A1Y8Q9RWRQJTBZ,B00030A5I4,A. Falcon,"[2, 5]","Picture quality is poor to the point of distraction. What could have been a beautiful seaside aerobics presentation is a video-noisy production with washed-out colors and fat dancing pixels popping up periodically. Images look hazy and out of focus, enough to make anyone dizzy. Also annoying is that every so often the picture suddenly turns a little dark--and then light again, like the double-flicking of a switch. Viewed on a standard-definition TV set, however, the disc's flaws will be less pronounced (except for the light shifts) and somewhat more tolerable (a high-definition TV will magnify video artifacts from crummy sources such as this DVD); therefore, you may want to hold on to your old, reliable tube TV for situations like this. The monophonic sound comes through clearly but as can be expected lacks depth and detail.If you can manage to get past the fuzz, blur, and pixelation, you will appreciate the excellent aerobics routine, executed with precision by the guru and his talented team. The program is broken down into several segments: Warm Up; Cardio Sequence 1, 2, and 3; Toning / Lower & Upper Body; Toning / Abdominals; and Cool Down. The moves are simple and very nicely choreographed.Bottom line: This DVD will have you checking whether you are in fact wearing your specs, or it will leave you thinking you need to get a pair.",2,"GREAT ROUTINE, BUT . . .",1197417600,"12 12, 2007",2007,1355,"['Picture', 'quality', 'poor', 'point', 'distraction', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'beautiful', 'seaside', 'aerobics', 'presentation', 'video-noisy', 'production', 'washed-out', 'colors', 'fat', 'dancing', 'pixels', 'popping', 'up', 'periodically', 'Images', 'look', 'hazy', 'focus', 'enough', 'make', 'anyone', 'dizzy', 'Also', 'annoying', 'so', 'often', 'picture', 'suddenly', 'little', 'dark', 'then', 'light', 'again', 'double-flicking', 'switch', 'Viewed', 'standard-definition', 'TV', 'set', 'however', 'disc', 'flaws', 'will', 'be', 'less', 'pronounced', 'light', 'shifts', 'somewhat', 'more', 'tolerable', 'high-definition', 'TV', 'will', 'magnify', 'video', 'artifacts', 'crummy', 'sources', 'such', 'DVD', 'therefore', 'may', 'want', 'hold', 'old', 'reliable', 'tube', 'TV', 'situations', 'monophonic', 'sound', 'clearly', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'lacks', 'depth', 'detail.If', 'can', 'manage', 'get', 'fuzz', 'blur', 'pixelation', 'will', 'appreciate', 'excellent', 'aerobics', 'routine', 'executed', 'precision', 'guru', 'talented', 'team', 'program', 'broken', 'down', 'several', 'segments', 'Warm', 'Up', 'Cardio', 'Sequence', '1', '2', '3', 'Toning', '/', 'Lower', 'Upper', 'Body', 'Toning', '/', 'Abdominals', 'Cool', 'Down', 'moves', 'are', 'simple', 'very', 'nicely', 'choreographed.Bottom', 'line', 'DVD', 'will', 'have', 'checking', 'are', 'fact', 'wearing', 'specs', 'will', 'leave', 'thinking', 'need', 'get', 'pair']",Beginners Weight Loss and Toning Program

This is an nice and effective low impact aerobic routine with lower body floor exercises, and as always with Gilad - the stretching before and after is very thorough. Gilad's way of leading is excellent. I have followed used his routines since his early days on ESPN and now at age 52 I see the fantastic benefits on my health and fitness.

He never does any difficult moves and he always describes very clearly how the exercise is to be done while demonstrating it.  This is not to say that the workouts are easy - they're not!  You will get a thorough workout with any of his DVD's.  What I like best about his methods is that he's always safe.  No moves are performed that will be harmful or damaging. Gilad is the reason that I have been able to keep fit for over 20 years.  He is the first thing I do every morning after feeding the cats.

854253,A95A9XOSHTQKX,B00030A5I4,"YeahSoMaybe? ""computersandmusicperson""","[3, 3]","I don't get a lot of exercise in my job.  I like this video because it has a simple scope of exercises that are doable by regular folks.  I also like that Gilad makes it clear to do what you can do and gives safety tips so you practice correctly.  He maintains good cheer and keeps it fun. This training video takes place on what appears to be a beach near a Hawaiian hotel.  There's a semi-live band playing music resembling what I call lounge faux high life / calypso, ska-lite.  (drum machine but live guitar, keyboard and bass and hand percussion.  Gilad has around 20 or so (total) men and women (fitness assistants) following along with his moves on rubber beach mats placed on the sand.  Gilad is on his own beach mat front and center of the camera, and alternating men and women located in the foreground on either side and then to about 50 feet back, all in sync with his movements.  Most of the trainers appear to be late 20's to late 30's in age.  The moves are fairly simple but if you're older and don't want to beat yourself up and yet be motivated...well.. I found it to be a good compromise.  One set in the middle of the video went on long enough that I wish they changed the tune or modulated or something but that's a minor quibble.  I'm guessing the aerobic training in the middle, is probably 120 - 130 beats per minute.  If you're out of shape, just take smaller steps and then work you way up to (a week or so later) high steps (up to the waist).  I do like that Gilad seems to believe in what he is doing and so when you are told things, it's encouraging instead of condescending.  The camera cuts a lot to other workout trainee's, they all seem to be cheerful and energetic.  Think of Gilad as a sort of exercise DJ keeping you on track.  He seems to have come a long way.I also own another (earlier?)  video of him which I can't recommend (60 & 30 Minutes Low Impact Workout) as he wasn't ""baked yet"". YMMV. It's just my opinion.  On that other video, it's just him, 3 trainer ladies and another guy on a beach with some totally canned music and very static / boring production values.  His hair in that other video looks a bit silly and his delivery and style come across as awkward, trying to hard, a bit less evolved / confident.SUMMARY:  I can recommend this particular Gilad video (""Beginners Weight Loss & Toning Program"").  I use it.  I like it.  It cheerfully encourages and motivates me and gives me a workout yet does not bark at me or make me feel like an idiot.P.S.  I found it helpful to obtain a decent, large area (4 X 8 ft), foldable, cushy exercise mat and place it directly in front of my flat screen TV.  I'm now able to do my workouts in the early a.m. before work without having to put on athletic shoes.  It's easier on the knees and hips if you are older.  The one I purchased off Amazon is:  Bonded Foam Gymnastics Mat - 4' x 8' x 2"" Blue by ORBRING  It's in my other reviews.",4,"Not bad for people who want a simple warm up, stretching, aerobic then cool down workout",1367712000,"05 5, 2013",2013,2926,"['do', ""n't"", 'get', 'lot', 'exercise', 'job', 'video', 'simple', 'scope', 'exercises', 'are', 'doable', 'regular', 'folks', 'also', 'like', 'Gilad', 'clear', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'safety', 'tips', 'practice', 'correctly', 'good', 'cheer', 'fun', 'training', 'video', 'place', 'what', 'be', 'beach', 'Hawaiian', 'hotel', 'semi-live', 'band', 'playing', 'music', 'resembling', 'what', 'call', 'lounge', 'faux', 'high', 'life', '/', 'calypso', 'ska-lite', 'drum', 'machine', 'live', 'guitar', 'keyboard', 'bass', 'hand', 'percussion', 'Gilad', 'around', '20', 'so', 'total', 'men', 'women', 'fitness', 'assistants', 'following', 'along', 'moves', 'rubber', 'beach', 'mats', 'placed', 'sand', 'Gilad', 'own', 'beach', 'mat', 'front', 'center', 'camera', 'alternating', 'men', 'women', 'located', 'foreground', 'side', 'then', '50', 'feet', 'back', 'sync', 'movements', 'Most', 'trainers', 'appear', 'be', 'late', '20', 'late', '30', 'age', 'moves', 'are', 'fairly', 'simple', ""'re"", 'older', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'beat', 'up', 'yet', 'be', 'motivated', 'well..', 'found', 'be', 'good', 'compromise', 'One', 'set', 'middle', 'video', 'went', 'long', 'enough', 'wish', 'changed', 'tune', 'modulated', 'something', 'minor', 'quibble', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'aerobic', 'training', 'middle', 'probably', '120', '130', 'beats', 'minute', ""'re"", 'shape', 'just', 'take', 'smaller', 'steps', 'then', 'work', 'way', 'week', 'so', 'later', 'high', 'steps', 'waist', 'do', 'Gilad', 'believe', 'what', 'doing', 'so', 'when', 'are', 'told', 'things', 'encouraging', 'instead', 'condescending', 'camera', 'lot', 'other', 'workout', 'trainee', 'seem', 'be', 'cheerful', 'energetic', 'Think', 'Gilad', 'sort', 'exercise', 'DJ', 'keeping', 'track', 'have', 'come', 'long', 'way.I', 'also', 'own', 'earlier', 'video', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', '60', '30', 'Minutes', 'Low', 'Impact', 'Workout', 'was', ""n't"", 'baked', 'yet', 'YMMV', 'just', 'opinion', 'other', 'video', 'just', '3', 'trainer', 'ladies', 'guy', 'beach', 'totally', 'canned', 'music', 'very', 'static', '/', 'boring', 'production', 'values', 'hair', 'other', 'video', 'bit', 'silly', 'delivery', 'style', 'come', 'awkward', 'trying', 'hard', 'bit', 'less', 'evolved', '/', 'confident.SUMMARY', 'can', 'recommend', 'particular', 'Gilad', 'video', 'Beginners', 'Weight', 'Loss', 'Toning', 'Program', 'use', 'cheerfully', 'workout', 'yet', 'not', 'bark', 'make', 'feel', 'idiot.P.S', 'found', 'helpful', 'obtain', 'decent', 'large', 'area', '4', 'X', '8', 'ft', 'foldable', 'cushy', 'exercise', 'mat', 'place', 'directly', 'front', 'flat', 'screen', 'TV', ""'m"", 'now', 'able', 'do', 'workouts', 'early', 'a.m.', 'work', 'having', 'put', 'athletic', 'shoes', 'easier', 'knees', 'hips', 'are', 'older', 'one', 'purchased', 'off', 'Amazon', 'Bonded', 'Foam', 'Gymnastics', 'Mat', '4', 'x', '8', 'x', '2', 'Blue', 'ORBRING', 'other', 'reviews']",Beginners Weight Loss and Toning Program
