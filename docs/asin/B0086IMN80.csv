The occasion was to market this for the war's sesquicentennial.The idea may have been great in theory, but it really adds up to a disappointment.  I don't mind the re-hash of reenactment video but it would have been nice to see some drama (i.e. speaking scenes by the reenactors).I didn't really need a new narrative documentary on the history of the Civil War but the main reasons I bought this program are because 1) it was $9.99 at FYE; and 2) because I was hoping it would contain clips of the film ""No Retreat From Destiny.""  It does.  I've long wanted to see that film but for some reason it is unavailable except at the price of $500 here on Amazon.

It is genuinely OUTSTANDING!The well-chosen letters read by voices familiar to many, the gripping musical selections (mostly period pieces though Ashokan is modern), and especially the wonderfully engaging and honest comments of Shelby Foote, make this a production which should be viewed by all Americans, and indeed by non-Americans as well.Having lived much of my life in the South (though a New Yorker at birth), I am keenly aware of the differences in viewpoint as to the political aspects of the terrible War Between the States.  These will continue to be debated ad infinitum.

Preston,"[0, 0]","I'd give this documentary five stars except for the poor quality of the soundtrack (the music is obnoxious and drowns out the commentators and the narrator - there are no subtitles).This documentary is very, very well-written.  It covers many of the moral, political and military issues of the time.  The re-creation of the battle scenes is some of the best that I've viewed.  The re-creations give you a real sense of the hardships and tragedies endured by the troops.The documentary seems to be fair and balanced, exploring the views and beliefs of both sides in the conflict (North and South).  The well-written narration illuminates many of the historical forces that shaped the world-shaking conflict.  For example, much of the brutality visited by the North on the South, at the end of the War, arose simply because everyone was despondent over the War and wanted it to end.  As the CSA still had over 150,000 troops in the field at the time of Appomattox (Lee's surrender), the War could have continued indefinitely.The documentary accurately points out the terrible attrition on both sides of the conflict (over 500,000 died on both sides) and the drastic efforts of leaders, on both sides, to try to end the conflict by decisive battles.There is a balanced, and erudite exploration of the moral and legal issues of slavery in the South.  There is also a very-well written episode on the efforts to reconstruct the South after the War, and, the political battles fought over the issue of whether to punish the South for the insurrection.In all, this is one of the best documentaries I've viewed on the Civil War.This makes an excellent background for understanding the political events which are the focus of Steven Spielberg's recent film: Lincoln",4,Well-written,1354320000,"12 1, 2012",2012,1756,"[""'d"", 'give', 'documentary', 'five', 'stars', 'poor', 'quality', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'obnoxious', 'out', 'commentators', 'narrator', 'are', 'subtitles', '.This', 'documentary', 'very', 'very', 'well-written', 'many', 'moral', 'political', 'military', 'issues', 'time', 're-creation', 'battle', 'scenes', 'best', ""'ve"", 'viewed', 're-creations', 'give', 'real', 'sense', 'hardships', 'tragedies', 'endured', 'troops.The', 'documentary', 'be', 'fair', 'balanced', 'exploring', 'views', 'beliefs', 'sides', 'conflict', 'North', 'South', 'well-written', 'narration', 'many', 'historical', 'forces', 'shaped', 'world-shaking', 'conflict', 'example', 'much', 'brutality', 'visited', 'North', 'South', 'end', 'War', 'arose', 'simply', 'everyone', 'was', 'despondent', 'War', 'wanted', 'end', 'CSA', 'still', 'had', '150,000', 'troops', 'field', 'time', 'Appomattox', 'Lee', 'surrender', 'War', 'could', 'have', 'continued', 'indefinitely.The', 'documentary', 'accurately', 'out', 'terrible', 'attrition', 'sides', 'conflict', '500,000', 'died', 'sides', 'drastic', 'efforts', 'leaders', 'sides', 'try', 'end', 'conflict', 'decisive', 'battles.There', 'balanced', 'erudite', 'exploration', 'moral', 'legal', 'issues', 'slavery', 'South', 'also', 'very-well', 'written', 'episode', 'efforts', 'reconstruct', 'South', 'War', 'political', 'battles', 'fought', 'issue', 'punish', 'South', 'insurrection.In', 'one', 'best', 'documentaries', ""'ve"", 'viewed', 'Civil', 'War.This', 'excellent', 'background', 'understanding', 'political', 'events', 'are', 'focus', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'recent', 'film', 'Lincoln']",N/A

When other kids were reading about dinosaurs or sports figures, I was reading about Antietam, Gettysburg, and Vicksburg; about Lee and Jackson, Grant and Sherman.I have watched the Ken Burns The Civil War many times and it is superb.  But the Burns series is mostly still pictures and the individual consequences, personal letters, and driving social forces.  I lamented a lack of battlefield details and live action.The Ultimate Civil War provides that. While beginning with the underlying causes of the war (Episode 1, Sins Of The Fathers) which I consider the best summary of the causes of the war I have seen, the subsequent episodes move promptly into the battles.The battle maps, while briefly shown (well there IS the pause button of course) are detailed, clear and excellent. The maps of the battle of Gettysburg particularly showed the complex and sometimes chaotic nature of the attacks and counterattacks.  I particularly liked the way that arrows of attacks were straight when successful but curved back when failed.  I compliment the map-drawer.There are still photos and live re-enactments, and they are woven together well.You should not confuse the Ken Burns series with this one; they are different in focus, style and presentation much as West Side Story is different from Romeo and Juliet, but are both are telling the same same story.  You should have both.
