760143,A2WX1UESDOLXRE,B00009YXKE,"Ashley Quinn ""Ash""","[0, 1]","A few days ago, I was walking through Best Buy, tossing DVD's in my basket, not even knowing what some of them were about. Haggard was once of my random choices. It wasn't such a bad choice either. It stars Bam Margera and other random members of the Jackass crew from MTV.The movie is about a pathetic guy played by Ryan Dunn who is crying over his breakup with his girlfirend, Glauren. (Though I don't know why he's crying, she's one of the most intensely unlikeable people I've ever seen in a movie.) She needed some adventure in her life, her idea of an adventure being to date a guy with long hair and bad teeth named Hellboy. There are some great characters in this movie, including Ryan's friends Valo (Margera), who sports a top hat and whines about how unappealing love is now that Glauren and Ryan have split up. There's also Falcone, a crazy guy trying to invent a reverse microwave. The best character isn't even the most original-- Raab (played by a guy actually called Raab Himself), who evokes Sling Blade type mannerisms.The dialogue in this movie is excellent, some of the most original, as well as realisitc dialogue I've ever heard. The plot seems a bit aimless at times, and there are lots of parts where they show the clouds or cars moving at rapid speed to (I guess) show time change, this is actually just showing off on the movie makers part. Yet, I felt that it worked in some strange way.Check this movie out sometime and be sure to stick it out until the end. You'll probably be going, What the heck??!!, half the time, but who cares, it works for this movie.",4,A Strange Pleaser,1090972800,"07 28, 2004",2004,1586,"['few', 'days', 'ago', 'was', 'walking', 'Best', 'Buy', 'tossing', 'DVD', 'basket', 'not', 'even', 'knowing', 'what', 'were', 'about', 'Haggard', 'was', 'once', 'random', 'choices', 'was', ""n't"", 'such', 'bad', 'choice', 'either', 'Bam', 'Margera', 'other', 'random', 'members', 'Jackass', 'crew', 'MTV.The', 'movie', 'pathetic', 'guy', 'played', 'Ryan', 'Dunn', 'who', 'crying', 'breakup', 'girlfirend', 'Glauren', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'crying', 'one', 'most', 'intensely', 'unlikeable', 'people', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'needed', 'adventure', 'life', 'idea', 'adventure', 'being', 'date', 'guy', 'long', 'hair', 'bad', 'teeth', 'named', 'Hellboy', 'are', 'great', 'characters', 'movie', 'including', 'Ryan', 'friends', 'Valo', 'Margera', 'who', 'sports', 'top', 'hat', 'whines', 'how', 'unappealing', 'love', 'now', 'Glauren', 'Ryan', 'have', 'split', 'up', 'also', 'Falcone', 'crazy', 'guy', 'trying', 'invent', 'reverse', 'microwave', 'best', 'character', ""n't"", 'even', 'most', 'original', 'Raab', 'played', 'guy', 'actually', 'called', 'Raab', 'Himself', 'who', 'Sling', 'Blade', 'type', 'mannerisms.The', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'excellent', 'most', 'original', 'as', 'well', 'realisitc', 'dialogue', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'plot', 'bit', 'aimless', 'times', 'are', 'lots', 'parts', 'where', 'show', 'clouds', 'cars', 'moving', 'rapid', 'speed', 'guess', 'show', 'time', 'change', 'actually', 'just', 'showing', 'off', 'movie', 'makers', 'part', 'felt', 'worked', 'strange', 'way.Check', 'movie', 'sometime', 'be', 'sure', 'stick', 'out', 'end', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'going', 'What', 'heck', 'time', 'who', 'movie']",N/A

You've probably all seen Bam and his gang on Viva La Bam, Jackass and the hilarious CKY videos, but this is different. This movie is about Ryan Dunn's relationship with his girlfriend (Glauren). This movie is based on true events and stories from his relationship. Now this movie doesn't exactly have perfect acting and all, but for a first attempt, Bam pulled it off. This movie is hilarious and is different from a lot of other movies out there. It actually amazes me of how well a job Bam did making this movie. He put such a large amount of effort into making this film. Bam still manages to keep his style of filmmaking throughout this movie. A lot of people have been dissing Bam and giving him a hard time about this film, but in my opinion, it is hilarious, original and brilliant.

I had been looking for it since I saw the commercial for it at the beginning of &quot;CKY4&quot; back last March and thought it looked hilarious. I didn't expect good acting or an envoking plot, and I definetly did not get it. Just Ryan Dunn crying about his girlfriend which wasn't near as entertaining as I thought it would be and Bam Margera's constantly going voice, which I find to be extremely annoying at times. Yes, this is the part where I pick on Bam. I mean, why the hell does he use the words he does? I mean, he says &quot;haggard&quot;? Who the f*ck says &quot;haggard&quot;? I mean (as you can tell), he named the damn movie after it! And why is he ALWAYS laughing? I mean, in real life, not when he's &quot;acting&quot;. He always talks like he's trying to hide the fact he's about to burst out laughing. WHY?...ANYWAY. Sorry. Bam's one cool dude, I just had to get some things out. As I said before, this is not a good movie, and the only funny parts are those that Brandon DiCamillo and Raab Himself are featured. To be quite honest, I probably wouldn't even watch CKY if it weren't for Brandon. And he's not in this movie enough, neither is Raab. The parts they're in are the highlights.I woulf suggest buying this just for the funny ass parts featuring those two, but there's not enough of those funny ass parts, so this movie's not worth it.",2,Not That Good...,1073260800,"01 5, 2004",2004,1457,"['Being', 'fan', 'CKY', 'thought', 'might', 'buy', 'movie', 'encountered', 'local', 'Sam', 'Goody', 'had', 'been', 'looking', 'saw', 'commercial', 'beginning', 'quot', 'CKY4', 'quot', 'back', 'last', 'March', 'thought', 'looked', 'hilarious', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'good', 'acting', 'envoking', 'plot', 'definetly', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'Just', 'Ryan', 'Dunn', 'crying', 'girlfriend', 'was', ""n't"", 'near', 'as', 'entertaining', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'Bam', 'Margera', 'constantly', 'going', 'voice', 'find', 'be', 'extremely', 'annoying', 'times', 'Yes', 'part', 'where', 'pick', 'Bam', 'mean', 'why', 'hell', 'use', 'words', 'mean', 'quot', 'haggard', 'quot', 'Who', 'f*ck', 'quot', 'haggard', 'quot', 'mean', 'can', 'tell', 'named', 'damn', 'movie', 'why', 'ALWAYS', 'laughing', 'mean', 'real', 'life', 'not', 'when', 'quot', 'acting', 'quot', 'always', 'talks', 'trying', 'hide', 'fact', 'burst', 'out', 'laughing', 'WHY', 'ANYWAY', 'Sorry', 'Bam', 'one', 'cool', 'dude', 'just', 'had', 'get', 'things', 'out', 'said', 'before', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'only', 'funny', 'parts', 'are', 'Brandon', 'DiCamillo', 'Raab', 'Himself', 'are', 'featured', 'be', 'quite', 'honest', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'watch', 'CKY', 'were', ""n't"", 'Brandon', 'not', 'movie', 'enough', 'Raab', 'parts', ""'re"", 'are', 'highlights.I', 'woulf', 'suggest', 'buying', 'just', 'funny', 'ass', 'parts', 'featuring', 'two', 'not', 'enough', 'funny', 'ass', 'parts', 'movie', 'not', 'worth']",N/A

He co-wrote, directed, filmed, starred, and bankrolled the whole thing. That's what makes this movie so great. It was done by real people. The whole CKY crew stars in it, plus tons of cameos from the skate world.The movie is based off of Ryan (Random Hero) Dunn's real life love life. He plays the main character that has just been dumped by his girlfriend, ""Glauren"" (Jenn Rivell). He thinks she is the best woman in the world but everyone else knows she is the town jezebel. Ryan can't get over her and starts to freak out when he finds out she is dating a guy named ""Hellboy"" (Rake Yohn). His friends Valo (Bam) and Falcone (Bran DiCamillo) are there to vandalize, spy and plot against Glauren and Hellboy while Ryan goes nuts pining away for her.Tony Hawk plays a cop who busts Ryan. Jason Ellis plays a crazed record store employee who tries to annihilate Hellboy. Bucky Lasek, Brandon Novak, Tosh Townsend, Hoofbite, and even Bam's grandfather all have cameo roles in it.The cinematography is really cool. The dialogue is so twisted funny. The music is great. Lots of -HIM-, CKY and good old fashioned death metal. Plus the bonus stuff is just as good as the movie. If you are a Bam fan, a CKY fan, even a HIM fan, buy this movie!

What we got was basically an overlong skip we'd see on a CKY video or something. Random-ness comes and goes in some very pointless segments and scenes. There is alot of funny, funny parts involving Ryan, Bran, Don Vito and Mark Hanna. But the rest is just a mishmash of a loose love story gone totally wrong. The last 7 minutes is a sex-fantasy type compilation of Bam and some girl making out, Jenn Rivell (Bam's legit girlfriend) and another girl having sex and Ryan making it with another random girl. But what's funny is in fact FUNNY. Good stuff with Raab who plays a COMPLETE retard the whole film. Don Vito plays this Caligula-type suburbanite who seems to give Dunn alot of crap (if you've seen Vito before you'll know) also some very random scenes with Phil beating up Dunn and Mark Hanna laughing nonstop or just acting like a fool. There's good skits with some pro skaters like Tony Hawk for one, Mike Mal in one scene, Bucky Lasek and Tim o Connor. But this is a MOVIE not a skate video.Another thing I didn't like about this was the constant use of that band HIM. HIM is just a gothic rock group with a few good and bad songs, but every other song is either a HIM song or Bran with CKY (there's one good Stooges song for a good part though) but I didn't like the overkill of the band HIM, just because it's Bam's favorite band doesn't mean we have to hear it every other scene.I can't recommend it because this is impossible to rent, so buy if you're a hardcore fan.
