757784,A48THA5X4OUAB,B00009V7RV,Billyjack D'Urberville,"[8, 8]","This is a very accurate portrayal of Scott Fitzgerald's last days as he struggles to create the novel The Last Tycoon under the eye of a youthful secretary who basically must become his housewife.  The story is not only about writing, but about a talented man's struggle to maintain his decency and integrity after totally blowing out his personality with a monstrous addiction to alcohol.  He mainly succeeds, not always, but it is the sort of thing which ought to be shown at AA meetings.Scott was eccentric to start with, of course.  His institutionalized wife Zelda comes into his view in flashbacks that look like demented alcoholic dreams, in which Zelda is interestingly interpreted by Sissy Spacek.  Nave Campbell's portrayal of the secretary is great, and Irons' inhabitation of Fitzgerald very shrewd, going for essences, and entirely convincing.  This is one of those rare movies which convincingly grapples with the creative process, even as it survives under impossible circumstances.

A serious movie about an artist who has witnessed the highs of fame, acceptance, love, beauty, and brilliance and is now living through the last days of daily struggle of writing when it is no longer easy, of needing to quit drinking in order to write, of having bad health sapping his energy, but is still honest about himself.

I can't even recall who the other actors were (such as Sissy Spacek playing Fitzgerald's insane wife). The backdrop sets showing a 1930's Hollywood and environs were also very nicely executed.Fitzgerald is portrayed as the tortured genius - recklessly squeezing the most out of life and his failing body.  His young secretary Frances, is shown by Campbell to be a novice star-struck author and loyal secretary to Fitzgerald . . . rather wise for her years.  Again, with the beautiful 1930's L.A. backdrop and the strong leads, this could'a/should'a been a great movie.  In my opinion the screenplay let it down.

Scott Fitzgerald is award winning actor Jeremy Irons. While I have the greatest respect for Irons as an actor I just didn't feel he pulled off this part. Irons has an evilness that seems to hang around his characters and Fitzgerald never struck me as evil only severely flawed and tempted. So the brooding and self-deprecating Irons never allowed the vulnerability of Fitzgerald to shine through in this role, but he sure plays a mean drunk.Neve Campbell plays Fitzgerald's faithful and infatuated secretary, Frances. Campbell is pretty good in this role but cowers against the strength of Irons at times. She pulls off the period well conforming enough to the standards of women working during the late 30's. Also appearing off and on as a negative force in the film is Sissy Spacek as Zelda Fitzgerald. I thought the film would have been much more interesting with a little more Spacek and some of Zelda's drama.I enjoyed this film only because it provided a bit of an inside look into the downfall of the great F.
