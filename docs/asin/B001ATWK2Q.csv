Still, I found Dog Tags to be a wonderful independent movie, of good caliber in its making, and engaging in its story.  The coming together of these two very different guys sets the stage for a story about facing one's need to change life and the reasons why the change is needed. Most of the story only covers a period of a few days, but the emotions explored and the self-discovery made left me with a real caring for both of the main characters, and a sense of hope that even through disappointment and some loss, moving ahead with the future is promising.  The musical soundtrack on this film is also quite enjoyable.",4,Looking again,1240963200,"04 29, 2009",2009,717,"['reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'complained', 'dvd', 'jacket', 'being', 'bit', 'misleading', 'maybe', 'so', 'Still', 'found', 'Dog', 'Tags', 'be', 'wonderful', 'independent', 'movie', 'good', 'caliber', 'making', 'engaging', 'story', 'coming', 'together', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'guys', 'stage', 'story', 'facing', 'one', 'need', 'change', 'life', 'reasons', 'why', 'change', 'needed', 'Most', 'story', 'only', 'period', 'few', 'days', 'emotions', 'explored', 'self-discovery', 'made', 'left', 'real', 'caring', 'main', 'characters', 'sense', 'hope', 'even', 'disappointment', 'loss', 'moving', 'ahead', 'future', 'promising', 'musical', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'also', 'quite', 'enjoyable']",Dog Tags
1168337,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B001ATWK2Q,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[23, 25]","Raised by his single, working mom, Nate never had a father, older sibling or close friend as a role model, and has been pretty much sleepwalking through his young life, doing what he was told but neer following through on anything he started.  To make money to buy his older girlfriend a nice engagement ring, he enlists in the Marine Corp and, having completed basic training, has a leave to visit home before he takes combat training and gets deployed to Iraq.  Hitchhiking to a jewelry store near the base, he gets detoured to a place where he meets up with Andy, a seemingly free spirited young gay man who is on a ""road trip"" to leave his responsibilities behind.  The two misfits form a mutually supportive friendship, and travel together, visiting Andy's mother (a Hollywood actress turned recluse) and looking for Nate's father whom he has never met.  Along the way, their friendship turns from platonic to a sexual affair, and the two take a big step toward becoming responsible adults.This isn't really a gay romance, as the sexuality of the young men seems as confused as they are, meaning this might just be one side trip in their paths to adulthood.  But it is a beautifully-told story of life and love, how loneliness and lack of direction can affect a person, and how much difference a good friend can make. Film is not rated, but would be a soft R for sexual content and rear nudity.  DVD has director commentary and trailers.

""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[5, 5]","From the title ""Dog Tags,"" and the ""come hither"" photograph of sexy,  alluring actor Paul Preiss above the words ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" on the DVD cover, you might initially think this film is a military variation on ""Brokeback Mountain."" It really is not. Dog tags are, of course, a military means of identification. The film tells the story of two guys,  (Paul Preiss and the extremely sad eyed  but strangely attractive Bart Fletcher) both dealing with indentity crisis; both struggling to find their place and purpose in the world.Nate (Preiss) joins the Marines out of a sense of obligation to his mother (Candy Clark) and his fiancee (Amy Lindsay). She seems anxious for Nate to get her pregnant before he goes away to boot camp. Nate later discovers his fiancee is a deceitful tramp anxious to get pregnant by ANY man! He tells his mother, if he had known about her trampy ways, he wouldn't have signed up for the Marines. He also discoveres that his mother has lied to him for years about who his father is. By this time, Nate has met Andy, (Fletcher) who believes in the freedom of the open road, clean slates,  and infinity.  Nate considers going AWOL and running away with Andy.Nate and Andy meet in the weirdest way. Their friendship begins when they escape from a Porno Producer named ""Uncle Sam."" Nate and Andy travel to meet Andy's mother Louise, a faded actress who is a marginally better mother than Nate's. Here, we learn that Andy has an infant son named Travis; the result of a drunken picnic with a girl he barely remembers, if at all. Andy doesn't want to be a dad, but he does feel a slight sense of responsibility. So Baby Travis joins Nate and Andy on their journey to find Nate's real dad... and themselves.In a hotel room, Nate and Andy's relationship becomes briefly but intensely sexual. The next morning, Andy says, ""there are no 'supposed tos'...What does Nate want to do?"" Nate  promptly  joins Andy in the shower.The editing makes the film difficult to follow.At the end of the film, both Nate and Andy are on the road to responsibility; although obviously and sadly without each other. The DVD includes an Audio Commentary from writer/director Damion Dietz. Perhaps he explains here why he told the story the way he did, with such confusing editing. The movie is often very touching and moving, but theviewer is left  going back and forth; having to put too many pieces together.",3,"""DOG TAGS"": TOUCHING & MOVIING FILM IS HURT BY CONFUSING EDITING",1232496000,"01 21, 2009",2009,2414,"['title', 'Dog', 'Tags', 'come', 'hither', 'photograph', 'sexy', 'alluring', 'actor', 'Paul', 'Preiss', 'words', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Ask', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Tell', 'DVD', 'cover', 'might', 'initially', 'think', 'film', 'military', 'variation', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'really', 'not', 'Dog', 'tags', 'are', 'course', 'military', 'means', 'identification', 'film', 'story', 'two', 'guys', 'Paul', 'Preiss', 'extremely', 'sad', 'eyed', 'strangely', 'attractive', 'Bart', 'Fletcher', 'dealing', 'indentity', 'crisis', 'struggling', 'find', 'place', 'purpose', 'world.Nate', 'Preiss', 'Marines', 'sense', 'obligation', 'mother', 'Candy', 'Clark', 'fiancee', 'Amy', 'Lindsay', 'anxious', 'Nate', 'get', 'pregnant', 'away', 'boot', 'camp', 'Nate', 'later', 'discovers', 'fiancee', 'deceitful', 'tramp', 'anxious', 'get', 'pregnant', 'ANY', 'man', 'mother', 'had', 'known', 'trampy', 'ways', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'signed', 'up', 'Marines', 'also', 'mother', 'lied', 'years', 'who', 'father', 'time', 'Nate', 'met', 'Andy', 'Fletcher', 'who', 'freedom', 'open', 'road', 'clean', 'slates', 'infinity', 'Nate', 'considers', 'going', 'AWOL', 'running', 'away', 'Andy.Nate', 'Andy', 'meet', 'weirdest', 'way', 'friendship', 'when', 'escape', 'Porno', 'Producer', 'named', 'Uncle', 'Sam', 'Nate', 'Andy', 'travel', 'meet', 'Andy', 'mother', 'Louise', 'faded', 'actress', 'who', 'marginally', 'better', 'mother', 'Nate', 'Here', 'learn', 'Andy', 'infant', 'son', 'named', 'Travis', 'result', 'drunken', 'picnic', 'girl', 'barely', 'remembers', 'Andy', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'dad', 'feel', 'slight', 'sense', 'responsibility', 'Baby', 'Travis', 'Nate', 'Andy', 'journey', 'find', 'Nate', 'real', 'dad', 'themselves.In', 'hotel', 'room', 'Nate', 'Andy', 'relationship', 'briefly', 'intensely', 'sexual', 'next', 'morning', 'Andy', 'are', ""'supposed"", 'tos', 'What', 'Nate', 'want', 'do', 'Nate', 'promptly', 'Andy', 'shower.The', 'editing', 'film', 'difficult', 'follow.At', 'end', 'film', 'Nate', 'Andy', 'are', 'road', 'responsibility', 'obviously', 'sadly', 'other', 'DVD', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'writer/director', 'Damion', 'Dietz', 'Perhaps', 'here', 'why', 'told', 'story', 'way', 'did', 'such', 'confusing', 'editing', 'movie', 'often', 'very', 'touching', 'moving', 'theviewer', 'left', 'going', 'back', 'forth', 'having', 'put', 'too', 'many', 'pieces', 'together']",Dog Tags

1168343,A30KGYUOZRUCRJ,B001ATWK2Q,Hulka,"[6, 7]","This is a story about a young man with an identity crisis who finds his father, with the help of an unlikely companion. Nate, played by gorgious hunk Paul Preiss, is a young man who finds little emotional support in the two women in his life---his trashy mother, and equally trashy and unfaithful girlfriend.Coaxed by the women into becoming a Marine, he has just finished boot camp and headed for Iraq. Of course, before he goes he wants to meet his father, whom he knows nothing about. By mistake he meets goth gayboy Andy, played by Bart Fletcher, who is immediately infatuated with handsome masculine Nate, and latches onto him. Interestingly enough, Nate is has a baby boy, and Nate responds to the pair in a protective masculine way. Andy is also a empathetic confident, providing Nate with the emotional support he does not get from his mother or his girlfriend. So naturally emotionally wounded Nate connects with Andy, and they end up having sex.This plot could have worked just as well if Andy had been an unwed mother, but the fact that he is a guy just adds a gay theme to a story that was not really about gay issues. Sadly, the script has some confusing twists that just do not make for a coherent satisfying story...which is why I gave this 3 stars.For starter, the beginning sequense that seems to conflict with the rest of the story. And what were those gratitious sex scenes between Andy and someone other then Nate supposed to have been about? Also, Bart Fletcher is really a little too old to be playing a teenage Hollywood goth gay boy, and seems a lot older then 18 year old Nate.It would be sweet to imagine that after connecting so intimately, and Andy being the perfect yang to Nate's masculine ying, that Andy would move in with Nate's mother and wait patiently for his man to come home from Iraq. If Nate was killed in combat, the beginning sequense---and perhaps the sex scenes with a guy resembling Nate---would have made some sense. But instead we get what we got, and thus a great potential is reduced to a somewhat confusing story.However, there is enough substance to this movie, and some great performances---espcially by Paul Preiss---that with a little imagination you would find this movie to be a sweet, warm-hearted experience. But it is sad that you have to use your imagination to do so. But bad as most gay movies are, this one is really tolerable, if not enjoyable.

It's been an interesting and very entertaining experience so far.I don't often become a fan of directors (Hitchcock is the only other I can think of). Like most people, I automatically give the actors credit, since they're the ones I actually see and hear, am either entertained and moved by or not. But there's something different about Damion Dietz. I don't know what that difference is yet, and I may never find out, but I'll have fun looking.I just find myself LIKING him, a lot. He seems like an old and very close, dear friend. When I watch his movies, I feel like I'm being welcomed, with arms open wide, into a fascinating, delightful, very personal world that he's very, very eager to share with me. Watching his movies isn't like watching a story but entering into a vision. Not a creepy or ponderous vision, but a mostly lighthearted, good-natured, loving but not at all trite vision of what life means to him, of what interests him, of how the world looks to him, of how he feels about people in general and the specific people he's recording at the moment. It's a truly wonderful experience.Damion Dietz is an extraordinarily generous man and a gifted filmmaker. It's a joy watching his career and his talents develop before my eyes. I think my only small regret so far is that as his movies become more professional they also become easier on the eyes. The experience of watching them is no less wonderful, but the look is cleaner, more conventional, more ""Hollywood.""  He can get beautiful actors to work for him now, which is nice in its way, but it makes me homesick for the old days, when his own lovely but wholly un-glamorous face and his gangly, graceful body graced the screen. He's an amazingly attractive, dynamic, charismatic performer, but he's not conventionally beautiful at all, which makes him all the more appealing. I really hope he'll come back out in front of the camera again soon. I miss him. He's such a delight to watch.See how amazing this is? I'd never heard of Damion Dietz a week ago, and already I miss him! There's something truly extraordinary about his man.I'm sorry I never got around to saying anything about this movie, but I just can't help it. Maybe I can come back later and add something.

1168347,A8QG61LYK0XO1,B001ATWK2Q,JUST A REVIEWER2,"[8, 13]",".........his true sexuality is?""((Here is my approach to obtaining/viewing/reviewing Gay tales in film form.  Simply, it's seeking the holy grail of that genre, or looking for the ""Addictive Film""---that movie one returns to time and again).  Selection/purchase is based mainly on finding new releases by favorite directors/screenwriters and/or your comments/reviews at major online film sales or review sites.  Sometimes I feel correctly steered by you (the ""Keepers"" filling my DVD shelves), other times mislead, occasionally badly (the ""Throwaways""----and I do toss 'em).  Rarely, I come across the ""Addictive,"" those watchable every couple of months or so (see below starred *** area for a list......and some ""near-Addictive"" as well).  For some movies, I'll share a review with you, as follows.  Thanks for sticking with me so far.))When buying this film, I had hoped for something perhaps as well done, and along the lines of, the recently released ""Shelter"" a film highly received by many of we everyday, nonprofessional reviewers.  However, that hope was quickly turned topsy-turvy (learn the primary reason for this by continuing on to the Postscript, below).To this viewer, this is NOT a ""Gay Romance"" and certainly not a ""Gay Drama.""  (Oh, I know, I know, those of you who've seen the film will say:  ""what about the bed and shower scenes?""  Then I'd come back with:  ""maybe he was just getting to that 'you-show-me-yours-I'll-show-you-mine' life phase a little later than most"").  But to continue, what this film is, is a story in drama form of two young men trying to find themselves and their roles in life.  One is heterosexual (Nate), one is gay (Andy); one is more a goalless, live-day-to-day type who's looking for a way to change all that; one is, simply, a free spirit......with a haunting memory.  Our lead character, Nate, is someone at the most vulnerable point in his existence, someone desperately in need of comforting----and it just happens that the person who then comes into his life is gay.  And, now that you know bare details for each character, you should also be made aware that, because of strong needs brought about by problems in both men's lives, they do fall into sex.........but they do NOT fall into love.  Still, Paul Preiss (Nate) and Bart Fletcher (Andy) are, together, able to achieve quite a high degree of ""chemistry"" (not of the Trevor Wright / Brad Rowe caliber), which is very important to making their characters believable to us.But, wait, there is yet another character of note making up this interesting little group of ours:  Nate's mother, Deb (nicely played by Candy Clark).  In this character we have someone who, to avoid a hurtful situation, sets an even more painful event into play.  She seemingly loves her son, but whether she's always honest with him, as would be hoped, remains for us to find out.I do have to especially address Paul Preiss's performance because, as a newbie to filmed acting, he most definitely gives this viewer a sense of his being ""a natural"" to acting (similar to, I would say, the case of Wright).  Further, unlike Fletcher who is very good in his role, it is Preiss who takes control of / commands our attention.One especially jarring note, for this reviewer, involves the writer / director's apparent need to insert what I consider gratuitous gay sex into the film's first twenty minutes.  A heterosexual sex scene, on the other hand, seemed appropriate to developing aspects of Preiss's character.  Again, I certainly did not see any real need for the nude male frontal scenes associated with Fletcher's character building (I've already got others of that type DVD).  What was the director trying to do, anyway, shout out: this IS a gay movie?!!  Obviously, Dietz chose not to aim this production for the mainstream market---too bad for Preiss's and Fletcher's futures; they deserved more.  (Extra Point / Star given for Preiss and Fletcher performances..........none extra given for the director's)PS--To, finally, address this review's subject question about sexuality, we know that character, Nate (representing the Director), at the most emotionally low and vulnerable point in his life, has a ""gay event"" with likely the most understanding and encouraging person he's ever met.  But, from that point on and through film's end, is there anything that tells us, definitively (or even near definitively), what the sexuality future of Nate / Damion is going to be?  Please don't give me conjectures in trying to answer this.((NOTE to Director Dietz:  Check your Dog Tags, Damion............maybe in addition to name, SSAN, blood type, they'll tell you your sexuality.))***This DVD won't get tossed out in the trash----but it certainly won't make it onto this viewer's ""Addictive"" list either. Other, but not all, films which are habit formers: ""Just a Question of Love"" / ""Brokeback Mountain"" / ""Boy Culture"" / ""All Over the Guy"" / ""Second Skin (Unrated Version)"" / ""The Man I Love"" / ""The Man of My Life"" (maybe for older/gay thinking man viewers) / ""Oh Happy Day"" (do youselves a big favor and see this one / no longer available here, but see DVDPriceSearch.com) / ""Fashion Victims"" (only if you have an all-regions player---then try Amazon.com.UnitedKingdom)",3,"""Did the Director ever find out what...........",1227657600,"11 26, 2008",2008,5254,"['true',

1168348,A20R44GC750MIO,B001ATWK2Q,"Michael Soros ""bronzebus34""","[0, 0]","As a rule of thumb the quality of a film is in inverse proportion to the amount of clothes the actors are wearing on the DVD cover jacket. I presume the marketing department decide that the hope of seeing hot men in the buff will entice an unwary buyer into purchasing the DVD for the actor if nothing else. I bought this cheaply so had nothing to lose. My first remark is to the person who chose to put a photo of the main actor without clothes on the cover &#8211; you did a great disservice to the film. There is very little nudity or torso shots in the film at all so that will come as a disappointment to any viewers hoping for gratuitous nakedness.The predominant theme running through the film is the nature of Fatherhood. Both characters have father issues. The main protagonist Nate because he doesn&#8217;t know who his father is and his mother won&#8217;t tell him. He believes he found out who he is and surprised to find out he is a successful businessman. The first half of the film is a build up to that meeting. I&#8217;ll say no more as it will spoil it.The other young man he meets [ Andy] lost his father when he was 14 and still lives with his agoraphobic actress mother who dominates him and has built her world around him &#8211; crushing him underneath her wings. He also has a baby boy whom he had with a quick tryst at a party. He can just about manage himself let alone the young child. He had a short but intense relationship with a marine some time in the past and he felt safe and secure in that relationship despite its brevity. The marine left one day (possibly for war) and was never heard of again. The memory of the man still haunts him. He reminds me of Quentin Crisp&#8217;s &#8216;Big Dark Man&#8217; and we get some flashbacks of him but because our hero can barely remember what he looked like now we never see his face full on. One reviewer remarked that the body double in the one love scene was quite obvious. The reason of course was that it was not a body double but the inclusion of this invisible man into the lovemaking. Andy sees in Nate, who is on leave from boot camp, a substitute for his big dark marine and a happy brief time in his life. Nate sees a lost soul in Andy who has very little practical skills and even less understanding of how the world works.Nate&#8217;s mother is wonderfully portrayed and it is only towards the end of the film that we learn why she tried to keep the knowledge of who Nate&#8217;s father is a secret. She tries to set him up with a waitress from the bar where she works but that went nowhere. Nate seems bossed about by her and she sees him as a meal ticket if she can only get pregnant by him &#8211; some attempts at this performance seem rather lack lustre by Nate who seems to see himself as nothing more than an insemination service. She is not all she seems either especially as we learn she has a cocktail named after her in the bar.The film is an exploration of finding the father figure who, they believe, will be the answer to all their prayers. This may not be so. Some have criticised the quickness with which Nate and Andy form such an intense relationship. However it is not the length of time that someone is in a relationship which determines its value or effectiveness but the growth that comes from it. The soul records only growth not time and by the end of the film you see that the seed of growth is planted and taking root.It&#8217;s a quite unexpected little gem of a film and it is moving the gay experience out from a niche into the mainstream as all gay men have fathers and all need to love and to be loved by them. This is not unique to only straight men.",5,Ignore the cover.

Heald ""tomalhe""","[63, 72]","Nate Merrit (Paul Preiss), a Marine just entering boot camp, is a superhero with an identity crisis: He's neither Superman nor Clark Kent. He's trapped by both a fiancee (Amy Lindsay) and a mother (""American Graffiti"" Oscar-nominee Candy Clark) who don't love him for who he is, but for the the man they think he could be.Andy Forte (the incredible, intense Bart Fletcher) is an equally lost ""careless... carefree"" loner who ""loses track of time"" and ""can't remember whether something happened four minutes ago or forty years from now."" Like Nate, Andy is on leave from his responsibilities when the two meet at an ill-fated ""Straight Marine's First Gay Sex"" porn shoot that neither thought they'd be involved with thanks to the maniupulation of its sleazy producer.Nate, a wannabe mechanic, helps get Andy's car fixed and the two learn more than they should by eavesdropping on conversations each has with the white trash families they're trying to escape. Both have abandonment issues and while lost in dreams of the future fall in love with the idea of one another. The two can't change one another's destinies, though they both wind up choosing to be better men than they'd ever planned to be by wiping the slate clean.A picture frame, a drive in movie theater screen, and a titular set of ""Dog Tags"" all fit into place in the haunting mystery of who Nate is, who his long lost father isn't, and the heartbreaking love story between a pair of stray animals.",4,A heartbreaking modern romance with lessons in masculinity,1225238400,"10 29, 2008",2008,1461,"['Nate', 'Merrit', 'Paul', 'Preiss', 'Marine', 'just', 'entering', 'boot', 'camp', 'superhero', 'identity', 'crisis', 'Superman', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'trapped', 'fiancee', 'Amy', 'Lindsay', 'mother', 'American', 'Graffiti', 'Oscar-nominee', 'Candy', 'Clark', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'who', 'man', 'think', 'could', 'be.Andy', 'Forte', 'incredible', 'intense', 'Bart', 'Fletcher', 'equally', 'lost', 'careless', 'carefree', 'loner', 'who', 'track', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'something', 'happened', 'four', 'minutes', 'ago', 'forty', 'years', 'now', 'Nate', 'Andy', 'leave', 'responsibilities', 'when', 'two', 'meet', 'ill-fated', 'Straight', 'Marine', 'First', 'Gay', 'Sex', 'porn', 'shoot', 'thought', ""'d"", 'be', 'involved', 'thanks', 'maniupulation', 'sleazy', 'producer.Nate', 'wannabe', 'mechanic', 'get', 'Andy', 'car', 'fixed', 'two', 'learn', 'more', 'should', 'eavesdropping', 'conversations', 'white', 'trash', 'families', ""'re"", 'trying', 'escape', 'have', 'abandonment', 'issues', 'lost', 'dreams', 'future', 'fall', 'love', 'idea', 'one', 'two', 'ca', ""n't"", 'change', 'one', 'destinies', 'wind', 'up', 'choosing', 'be', 'better', 'men', ""'d"", 'ever', 'planned', 'be', 'wiping', 'slate', 'clean.A', 'picture', 'frame', 'drive', 'movie', 'theater', 'screen', 'titular', 'set', 'Dog', 'Tags', 'fit', 'place', 'haunting', 'mystery', 'who', 'Nate', 'who', 'long', 'lost', 'father', ""n't"", 'heartbreaking', 'love', 'story', 'pair', 'stray', 'animals']",Dog Tags
1168355,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B001ATWK2Q,Tommy Dooley,"[2, 2]","This is a film from writer and director Damien Dietz, and he has yet to perfect either craft. That said I did still find merit in this film, and that is probably from the strength of the acting. It is about a guy called Nate (Paul Preiss), who is in a relationship with a domineering older woman sharing house with his mum/mom. She keeps reminding him how useless he is and so he might as well join the marines - she helps him in this task by shaving his head - to show commitment.We have an alternative story of Andy (Bart Fletcher) who has lost the love of his life; we assume being killed whilst on active duty. Their paths collide when a 'model shoot' sans clothes goes wrong, when Nate realises he has accepted one free ride too many. Andy leaves just after him and his car won't start, so ex mechanic Nate gets it going, ostensibly by looking at the engine. Andy then drops him off home where he uncovers an ulterior motive for his girlfriend's keenness to be shot of him.What happens next is an unlikely joining of the two, they meet a number of characters along the way as Nate tries to find out who his father is and reconcile himself with being a marine. This is unlikely but not preposterous; it seems to have been misold with the sexy cover. This is not a bedroom action flick, but a study in people and relationships, but even that is only done in a mostly superficial way.There are also the issues of the body double in one of the few bedroom scenes, which was a bit much, and the lingering shots of door frames etc. This looks like someone honing their craft or just filling the time up, but I think it is trying to be poignant, but just too arty to really pull it off. Besides all of the issues, I was kept entertained for the hour and a half and I have seen a lot worse, so actually a thumbs up, and more than passable for a rental.",3,Two Blokes An Unlikely Story and Extensive Eye Make Up!,1321056000,"11 12, 2011",2011,1849,"['film', 'writer', 'director', 'Damien', 'Dietz', 'yet', 'perfect', 'craft', 'said', 'did', 'still', 'find', 'merit', 'film', 'probably', 'strength', 'acting', 'guy', 'called', 'Nate', 'Paul', 'Preiss', 'who', 'relationship', 'domineering', 'older', 'woman', 'sharing', 'house', 'mum/mom', 'reminding', 'how', 'useless', 'so', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'join', 'marines', 'task', 'shaving', 'head', 'show', 'commitment.We', 'have', 'alternative', 'story', 'Andy', 'Bart', 'Fletcher', 'who', 'lost', 'love', 'life', 'assume', 'being', 'killed', 'whilst', 'active', 'duty', 'paths', 'collide', 'when', ""'model"", 'shoot', 'sans', 'clothes', 'wrong', 'when', 'Nate', 'accepted', 'one', 'free', 'ride', 'too', 'many', 'Andy', 'just', 'car', 'wo', ""n't"", 'start', 'so', 'ex', 'mechanic', 'Nate', 'going', 'ostensibly', 'looking', 'engine', 'Andy', 'then', 'off', 'home', 'where', 'ulterior', 'motive', 'girlfriend', 'keenness', 'be', 'shot', 'him.What', 'next', 'unlikely', 'joining', 'two', 'meet', 'number', 'characters', 'way', 'Nate', 'tries', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'father', 'reconcile', 'being', 'marine', 'unlikely', 'not', 'preposterous', 'have', 'been', 'misold', 'sexy', 'cover', 'not', 'bedroom', 'action', 'flick', 'study', 'people', 'relationships', 'even', 'only', 'done', 'mostly', 'superficial', 'way.There', 'are', 'also', 'issues', 'body', 'double', 'one', 'few', 'bedroom', 'scenes', 'was', 'bit', 'much', 'lingering', 'shots', 'door', 'frames', 'etc', 'someone', 'honing', 'craft', 'just', 'filling', 'time', 'up', 'think', 'trying', 'be', 'poignant', 'just', 'too', 'arty', 'really', 'pull', 'off', 'issues', 'was', 'kept', 'entertained', 'hour', 'half', 'have', 'seen', 'lot', 'worse', 'actually', 'thumbs', 'up', 'more', 'passable', 'rental']",Dog Tags
