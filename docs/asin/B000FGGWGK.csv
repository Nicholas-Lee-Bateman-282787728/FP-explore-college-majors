I can't remember what all as out at the time but I do remember seeing this as soon as they brought it out of the box. A movie starring not only the great Kevin James but one of his best friends and the guy he broke into the business with Ray Romano starred as well. When I looked on the back I noticed that Michael Rapaport, Juliette Lewis, and Burt Reynolds, you know I bought this.Dave [James] and Maurice [Romano] are meat salesman who go door to door trying to sell all kinds of meat and fridges. When trying to make a sell to some woman she gets a call from her friend who is suicidal, off they go to help out and try to make that sell. Dave needs to buy his daughter a birthday present and Maurice needs to finish school. But on this very hot day thinks don't work out well as they witness a murder and have to go on the run, they don't want to be killed either. The crazy thing is they still want those sales so even in danger they are pushing for sells.Writers Larry Hankin and William Tepper really came with an original story and the meat thing driving the film was really interesting. The script has a very distinct feel to it that is hard to describe but when you see it you will know what I am talking about. Director Jason Ensler really keeps things kinda gritty and realistic and keeps unexpected things happening. The humor of this film is most likely not for every one but for those who get it this is a very fun film.Kevin James is excellent as Dave and once again steals the show from all others with his down to earth but down and out performance. James can really act and he should try his hand at a couple of more dramatic roles, but don't leave the comedy either. Ray Romano is Maurice and he is not the Ray you watch on TV. This character is kinda driven by the opposite sex and has a bit of a mouth on him, at least compared to his TV image. Juliette Lewis as always is wonderful and proves why she is one of the greatest ever, and the same can be said about Michael Rapaport. Burt Reynolds is as much a presence on screen here as he ever was and Sof&iacute;a Vergara's character may surprise you.The humor of this film is either hit or miss depending on your taste but to me it is a very entertaining flick with a weird story. But it is a fun flick and the fact that these guys just want to sell some meat is hilarious to me considering what they go through. This movie is not for everybody but for the ones that will appreciate it is a fun flick.",5,KEVIN JAMES STEALS THE SHOW,1245196800,"06 17, 2009",2009,2662,"['GRILLEDI', 'remember', 'walking', 'Wal-Mart', 'one', 'night', 'were', 'bringing', 'out', 'new', 'releases', 'decided', 'wait', 'around', 'just', 'case', 'something', 'came', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'what', 'out', 'time', 'do', 'remember', 'seeing', 'as', 'soon', 'brought', 'box', 'movie', 'starring', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'Kevin', 'James', 'one', 'best', 'friends', 'guy', 'broke', 'business', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'starred', 'as', 'well', 'When', 'looked', 'back', 'noticed', 'Michael', 'Rapaport', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'know', 'bought', 'this.Dave', '[', 'James', ']', 'Maurice', '[', 'Romano', ']', 'are', 'meat', 'salesman', 'who', 'go', 'door', 'door', 'trying', 'sell', 'kinds', 'meat', 'fridges', 'When', 'trying', 'make', 'sell', 'woman', 'call', 'friend', 'who', 'suicidal', 'go', 'help', 'out', 'try', 'make', 'sell', 'Dave', 'buy', 'daughter', 'birthday', 'present', 'Maurice', 'finish', 'school', 'very', 'hot', 'day', 'thinks', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'well', 'witness', 'murder', 'have', 'go', 'run', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'killed', 'crazy', 'thing', 'still', 'want', 'sales', 'so', 'even', 'danger', 'are', 'pushing', 'sells.Writers', 'Larry', 'Hankin', 'William', 'Tepper', 'really', 'came', 'original', 'story', 'meat', 'thing', 'driving', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'interesting', 'script', 'very', 'distinct', 'feel', 'hard', 'describe', 'when', 'see', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'am', 'talking', 'Director', 'Jason', 'Ensler', 'really', 'things', 'kinda', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'unexpected', 'things', 'happening', 'humor', 'film', 'most', 'likely', 'not', 'one', 'who', 'get', 'very', 'fun', 'film.Kevin', 'James', 'excellent', 'Dave', 'once', 'again', 'show', 'others', 'down', 'earth', 'down', 'performance', 'James', 'can', 'really', 'act', 'should', 'try', 'hand', 'couple', 'more', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'do', ""n't"", 'leave', 'comedy', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'Maurice', 'not', 'Ray', 'watch', 'TV', 'character', 'kinda', 'driven', 'opposite', 'sex', 'bit', 'mouth', 'least', 'compared', 'TV', 'image', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'always', 'wonderful', 'why', 'one', 'greatest', 'ever', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Michael', 'Rapaport', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'as', 'much', 'presence', 'screen', 'here', 'ever', 'was', 'Sof', 'iacute', 'Vergara', 'character', 'may', 'surprise', 'you.The', 'humor', 'film', 'hit', 'miss', 'depending', 'taste', 'very', 'entertaining', 'flick', 'weird', 'story', 'fun', 'flick', 'fact', 'guys', 'just', 'want', 'sell', 'meat', 'hilarious', 'considering', 'what', 'go', 'movie', 'not', 'everybody', 'ones', 'will', 'appreciate', 'fun', 'flick']",N/A

I couldn't have been more wrong. The characters are deep and the humor is understated.  If you are expecting a slap stick laugh tracked sitcom style movie because of the actors you are out of luck.  When actors take themselves into a new role and play a different type of character I love it.  The ending may have been a little predictable but I thought there were enough twists and turns to keep you wanting to see how they got there.Another important aspect of a DVD is the extras not just the movie.

Let me try to clear the cloud of contrast.Those of you who love movies like Lost in Translation or other character studies may want to look into Grilled. The simple plot is a day in the life of two meat salesmen. Each are motivated to sell by different extenuating needs. The frustration of sales gone wrong adds to the sense of underlying desperation. They finally hit big time, until the bad guys come looking for the buyer and the sellers get sucked into a life and death drama.The movie is quirky more than funny.
