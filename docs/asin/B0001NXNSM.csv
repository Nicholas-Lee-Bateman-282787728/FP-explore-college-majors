Supposedly only the best were used, but I find it hard to believe after viewing all of them.  There are some very good films in the batch (&quot;The Hitch&quot; comes to mind as does &quot;Inside&quot;) and some not so good films (&quot;Song of the Zombie&quot; stands out).  For a so-so collection of horror shorts, this one is worth viewing.",3,So-So Horror Anthology,1089763200,"07 14, 2004",2004,448,"['Blood', 'Drive', 'collection', 'short', 'horror', 'films', 'made', 'regular', 'people', 'complied', 'Fangoria', 'magazine', 'Supposedly', 'only', 'best', 'were', 'used', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'viewing', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'films', 'batch', 'quot', 'Hitch', 'quot', 'mind', 'quot', 'Inside', 'quot', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'films', 'quot', 'Song', 'Zombie', 'quot', 'out', 'so-so', 'collection', 'horror', 'shorts', 'one', 'worth', 'viewing']",Fangoria - Blood Drive

You can tell that all of these people put a lot of effort into their films with varying results. However, filmmaking is not the Special Olympics, and I can't see any justification in a price over 10 dollars since god knows StarLog/Fangoria isn't paying anybody one red cent in royalties. I also think this DVD was a little bit mis-billed. Rob Zombie's only appearant involvement was to show up in the DVD menus for about 60 seconds of blurb-level ""ignore the man behind the curtain"" discourse. Some of the special features were actually interesting, but again not sufficient compensation in consideration of the price.Not bad, but then not particularly good, either.",3,Not bad,1093996800,"09 1, 2004",2004,699,"['Well', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'students', 'can', 'tell', 'people', 'put', 'lot', 'effort', 'films', 'varying', 'results', 'However', 'filmmaking', 'not', 'Special', 'Olympics', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'justification', 'price', '10', 'dollars', 'god', 'StarLog/Fangoria', ""n't"", 'paying', 'anybody', 'one', 'red', 'cent', 'royalties', 'also', 'think', 'DVD', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'mis-billed', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'only', 'appearant', 'involvement', 'was', 'show', 'up', 'DVD', 'menus', '60', 'seconds', 'blurb-level', 'man', 'curtain', 'discourse', 'special', 'features', 'were', 'actually', 'interesting', 'again', 'not', 'sufficient', 'compensation', 'consideration', 'price.Not', 'bad', 'then', 'not', 'particularly', 'good', 'either']",Fangoria - Blood Drive
812128,A1XJID6F8SHSVW,B0001NXNSM,Mark E. Ailes,"[0, 0]","This was one of the worse collection of short horror films I have ever seen. I am a novelist and horror short story writer and I was disappointed with this collection. I have also seen nearly 10,000 horror films and have seen some really raw and horrible stuff. On this collection the first two shorts were the best it had to offer. Then came the one called Inside which made absolute no sense at all. Shadows of the Dead felt rushed and didn't follow a story with a horrible ending. Mr. Eryams also rushed and stupid ending. It started off interesting but quickly lost its appeal. Disturbances was alright, but it really lacked. Forget Song of the Dead, I'm still trying to forget it. I wonder who actually picked these winners anyway. Oh well, this one goes on my trash pile. Good thing I got it for a quarter.",1,"If these were the winners, I hate to see the losers",1402704000,"06 14, 2014",2014,812,"['was', 'one', 'worse', 'collection', 'short', 'horror', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'am', 'novelist', 'horror', 'short', 'story', 'writer', 'was', 'disappointed', 'collection', 'have', 'also', 'seen', 'nearly', '10,000', 'horror', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'really', 'raw', 'horrible', 'stuff', 'collection', 'first', 'two', 'shorts', 'were', 'best', 'had', 'offer', 'Then', 'came', 'one', 'called', 'Inside', 'made', 'absolute', 'sense', 'Shadows', 'Dead', 'felt', 'rushed', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'story', 'horrible', 'ending', 'Mr.', 'Eryams', 'also', 'rushed', 'stupid', 'ending', 'started', 'off', 'interesting', 'quickly', 'lost', 'appeal', 'Disturbances', 'was', 'alright', 'really', 'lacked', 'Forget', 'Song', 'Dead', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'forget', 'wonder', 'who', 'actually', 'picked', 'winners', 'anyway', 'Oh', 'well', 'one', 'trash', 'pile', 'Good', 'thing', 'got', 'quarter']",Fangoria - Blood Drive

They obviously got their names to hype it into what its not. If you like b, better yet z-horror home videos, maybe this is for you, the first sequences is ok, the rest....well you'll see.
