1002541,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000GEIRV4,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 0]","When I run across a film pummeled with one scathing review after another, I have to see it - that's just what we bad horror film addicts do.  When you actually have people questioning why Lions Gate, a well-established purveyor of the worst films modern horror has to offer, would actually choose to distribute a film, the possibilities are almost mind-boggling.  Could Dark Fields possibly be the worst film ever made?  The answer, in my opinion, is no.  I've lived to tell about several no-budget horror films worse than this one.  Still, there's no getting around the fact that this film is pretty bloody awful - and not in a ""so bad it's good"" way.Writer/director Al Randall fails to instill the slightest trace of creativity or originality in this film.  Indeed, the plot is about as stereotypical and derivative as they come - a group of teenagers, stranded in the middle of nowhere long after sunset, end up fighting for their lives against a nondescript psychotic killer.  After running out of gas on their way to a concert, one of the teens heads off to a nearby farmhouse for help.  When he fails to return, the others head out to look for him.  Except for the presence of farm animals in the barn, the adjacent farm appears to be completely deserted - in fact, it looks like no one has been there in decades.  That doesn't stop the gang from searching the abandoned house top to bottom - including the dank dirt-floor cellar - and then moving on to the giant barn.  Finally, after an eternity, our killer finally shows up, at which point the film goes on complete slasher film auto-pilot.Throughout their ordeal, the kids make one stupid decision after another (and the same could be said of the filmmakers because goofs abound in the film - a visible boom mike, visible shadows of crew members, the detectable presence of a car every now and again in the background of this supposedly deserted setting, etc.).  Their attempts to hide - usually in the place the killer is sure to enter next - are almost laughable, as all the noise they make in addition to all the lights from the torches they're always waving about guarantee that just about anyone apart from Helen Keller could easily follow their every move.  The film's biggest problems, though, are the acting and the script.  Even if these weren't young and inexperienced actors being told to do everything over the top in an attempt to ""Americanize"" the film, there's no hope for a script that apparently relies as much on improvisation as terribly written dialogue.Jenna Scott is pretty hot in her low-riding jeans, while Lindsay Dell is pretty good at screaming -but that's about all this film has going for it.  Despite using an actual dilapidated farm property for its setting, which I wouldn't even want to enter by the light of day, Dark Fields never generates a single bit of atmosphere.  It's not the least bit scary at any moment, which is pretty much the kiss of death for any slasher film.  I have to give props to any filmmakers, amateur or professional, who go out and fulfill their dream of making a horror movie.  (After all, what horror fan wouldn't jump at the chance of putting his/her personal stamp on a blood-drenched frenzy of gory goodness?)  Despite all the want-to in the world, though, some of those films are just abysmal failures - and Dark Fields definitely falls in that category.",2,"In this case, I think the R rating stands for Rotten",1236470400,"03 8, 2009",2009,3378,"['When', 'run', 'film', 'pummeled', 'one', 'scathing', 'review', 'have', 'see', 'just', 'what', 'bad', 'horror', 'film', 'addicts', 'do', 'When', 'actually', 'have', 'people', 'questioning', 'why', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'well-established', 'purveyor', 'worst', 'films', 'modern', 'horror', 'offer', 'would', 'actually', 'choose', 'distribute', 'film', 'possibilities', 'are', 'almost', 'mind-boggling', 'Could', 'Dark', 'Fields', 'possibly', 'be', 'worst', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'answer', 'opinion', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'tell', 'several', 'no-budget', 'horror', 'films', 'worse', 'one', 'Still', 'getting', 'fact', 'film', 'pretty', 'bloody', 'awful', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'way.Writer/director', 'Al', 'Randall', 'instill', 'slightest', 'trace', 'creativity', 'originality', 'film', 'Indeed', 'plot', 'as', 'stereotypical', 'derivative', 'come', 'group', 'teenagers', 'stranded', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'long', 'sunset', 'end', 'up', 'fighting', 'lives', 'nondescript', 'psychotic', 'killer', 'running', 'out', 'gas', 'way', 'concert', 'one', 'teens', 'heads', 'nearby', 'farmhouse', 'help', 'When', 'return', 'others', 'head', 'look', 'presence', 'farm', 'animals', 'barn', 'adjacent', 'farm', 'be', 'completely', 'deserted', 'fact', 'one', 'been', 'there', 'decades', ""n't"", 'stop', 'gang', 'searching', 'abandoned', 'house', 'top', 'bottom', 'including', 'dank', 'dirt-floor', 'cellar', 'then', 'moving', 'giant', 'barn', 'Finally', 'eternity', 'killer', 'finally', 'up', 'point', 'film', 'complete', 'slasher', 'film', 'auto-pilot.Throughout', 'ordeal', 'kids', 'make', 'one', 'stupid', 'decision', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'filmmakers', 'goofs', 'abound', 'film', 'visible', 'boom', 'mike', 'visible', 'shadows', 'crew', 'members', 'detectable', 'presence', 'car', 'now', 'again', 'background', 'supposedly', 'deserted', 'setting', 'etc.', 'attempts', 'hide', 'usually', 'place', 'killer', 'sure', 'enter', 'next', 'are', 'almost', 'laughable', 'noise', 'make', 'addition', 'lights', 'torches', ""'re"", 'always', 'waving', 'guarantee', 'just', 'anyone', 'apart', 'Helen', 'Keller', 'could', 'easily', 'follow', 'move', 'film', 'biggest', 'problems', 'are', 'acting', 'script', 'Even', 'were', ""n't"", 'young', 'inexperienced', 'actors', 'being', 'told', 'do', 'everything', 'top', 'attempt', 'Americanize', 'film', 'hope', 'script', 'apparently', 'as', 'much', 'improvisation', 'terribly', 'written', 'dialogue.Jenna', 'Scott', 'pretty', 'hot', 'low-riding', 'jeans', 'Lindsay', 'Dell', 'pretty', 'good', 'screaming', '-but', 'film', 'going', 'using', 'actual', 'dilapidated', 'farm', 'property', 'setting', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'enter', 'light', 'day', 'Dark', 'Fields', 'never', 'single', 'bit', 'atmosphere', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'scary', 'moment', 'pretty', 'much', 'kiss', 'death', 'slasher', 'film', 'have', 'give', 'props', 'filmmakers', 'amateur', 'professional', 'who', 'go', 'out', 'fulfill', 'dream', 'making', 'horror', 'movie', 'what', 'horror', 'fan', 'would', ""n't"", 'jump', 'chance', 'putting', 'personal', 'stamp', 'blood-drenched', 'frenzy', 'gory', 'goodness', 'want-to', 'world', 'films', 'are', 'just', 'abysmal', 'failures', 'Dark', 'Fields', 'definitely', 'category']",Dark Fields

Leaving his friends back at the car, Drew the driver appraoches the farmhouse to get some help, but finds no one home. Around back he discovers a fuel supply tank and a plastic container, so he attempts to get some gas. He gets something a little more than expected...The killer is pretty comical, and looks like he's wearing a bad halloween wig backwards. Pretty strange, and not scary in the least. Through the rest of the film it seems as if the killer is rather apathetic and, well, dumb. It's not evident whether he's taunting and teasing by letting the people get away so easily, or if he's just a dolt.For the most part the acting is poor, but the old man in the truck is hysterical, ""...you're gonna have to quit beatin' on me! Gee willakers!"" You can tell decent talent when it's there because those actors will make a scene work a little bit on their own.Some problems with continuity...Note to director: Next time you use a character's need to pee as an excuse to get the group off the main road into backwoods country, and he's been complaining the whole way, make sure he pees when they finally stop. What an oversight! How do you miss that?When the girls are trying to find keys to the butcher shop near the truck, we get a shot up the road as one girl is checking the dead guy's pockets. Clearly, there is a car parked a short distance away. When the girls head in off in that direction moments later, the car is gone. Interesting. In the same scene, as the girls run off down the road, we see a shadow being cast on the road of someone who is behind the camera. Was it the killer, or cameraman?The killer doesn't seem too enthusiastic during the entire film, but especially in the finale. It's almost as if he wants to be attacked, he basically just moves too slow and the scenes are so drawn out that he appears to just stand there and take it. Some fast cuts and more action shots would have helped increase urgency and make the scenes more intense.The writing, direction (same guy), as well as acting and soundtrack leave a lot to be desired, however the film does boast some nice lighting and cinematography, and locations. Unfortunately it's shot in 4:3, it would have looked a lot nicer in 16:9.In all it's a pretty bad movie, but believe it or not, there's worse.",2,He didn't pee!

This filmed sucked on so many different levels I don't even know where to begin. So I guess I'll start with the fact that its a rehash of any other slasher movies. Five kids on their way to a concert run out of gas near an old abandon farmstead. Then get picked off one by one, by a 'killer'.  The gore in this film in nil, any blood spilt  looked like red paint and the extent of this was puddles on the ground, splashes or sprays on the wall.  The Budget wasn't there on this part of the film.Ok, so almost an hour of this 81 minute turkey is spent putzing around the farmstead looking for the kid they sent to get more gas.  Bad acting, no no, horrible acting with a horrible script make this crudely shot movie almost unbearable.  To make things worse, there is almost no music soundtrack to add to the suspense.Its apparent to me that the bulk of the budget was spent on camera equipment and editing.  Location is almost entirely on the farmstead, most likely donated from a friend.  This whole movie screams college film school project.What made this film laughable was that the killer guy was such a light weight! the two surviving girls escape his clutches several times, and even manage to knock him out quite easily.  The other thing I found humerous, was that all the actors were canadian, you didn't know it until they had to say ""house"", ""out"", or ""about"", then it was hoose, oot and aboot!  fantastic!Bottom Line:  Don't waste your time, you'd probably have a better time watching grass grow.",1,"Garbage, with a capital ""G"".

Dark Fields was very bad it's true, but it was watchable if you're bored enough.  Yes the killer was pretty weak and how easily the two girls kept escaping was silly.  They should have just turned on him, beat the crap out of him as they were certainly capable of and moved on.  A lot of people got killed in this film by a pretty wimpy villain.  I give this movie 2 stars only because I read the other 9 reviews done before mine and WOW!!!  I had to take the oppurtunity to be the highest rating of a film ever...  This may be the worst HORROR movie every made and that takes quite a bit of doing as there are some bad ones out there.  So the bottom line here is that every reviewer who gave this film only one star is right on.  Combine bad acting, a low budget and a silly plot and this is what you get.  However, I did find the out-takes during the credits somewhat humorous...Probably better than the movie.  That's what I should have done.  Skipped the movie and just gone to the somewhat entertaining closing credits.

It's almost the ultimate expression of After Dark-ness. It takes a classic horror-film motif, couches it in a clich&eacute;-ridden script, adds a passel of below-average actors (many of whom have never acted before) and pedestrian direction, along with one or more substandard technical details (in this case, the sound, which is depressing because the soundtrack is actually the best thing about the film) and some less-than-stellar special effects to create a nigh-unwatchable stew guaranteed to leave you with indigestion.In this case, the conceit at the heart of the film is the ""running out of gas and going to the serial killer's house for help"" motif. Which can be done with style, and has been done with style many times. But you know, these folks weren't even trying. It's not only phoned in, it's phoned in from a tunnel, where the reception is hideous, going from mobile phone to mobile phone, with the signal fading in and out like a cheap television heard through the wall of a by-the-hour motel. There is nothing about this movie to even remotely recommend it; despite only having been four days into the new year when I watched it, I feel confident in stating that this will be one of the five worst movies I see in 2009. It gets half a star because I finished it, and because when you can actually hear the music in the soundtrack, it's not too bad.",1,"The single worst movie I saw in January, and that's saying something",1233964800,"02 7, 2009",2009,1538,"['Dark', 'Fields', 'Al', 'Randall', '2006', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'Dark', 'Horrorfest', 'managed', 'miss', 'one', 'crappiness', 'usually', 'found', 'Dark', 'movies', 'then', 'almost', 'ultimate', 'expression', 'Dark-ness', 'classic', 'horror-film', 'motif', 'clich', 'eacute', '-ridden', 'script', 'passel', 'below-average', 'actors', 'many', 'whom', 'have', 'never', 'acted', 'pedestrian', 'direction', 'one', 'more', 'substandard', 'technical', 'details', 'case', 'sound', 'depressing', 'soundtrack', 'actually', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'less-than-stellar', 'special', 'effects', 'create', 'nigh-unwatchable', 'stew', 'guaranteed', 'leave', 'indigestion.In', 'case', 'conceit', 'heart', 'film', 'running', 'out', 'gas', 'going', 'serial', 'killer', 'house', 'help', 'motif', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'style', 'been', 'done', 'style', 'many', 'times', 'know', 'folks', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'trying', 'not', 'only', 'phoned', 'phoned', 'tunnel', 'where', 'reception', 'hideous', 'going', 'mobile', 'phone', 'mobile', 'phone', 'signal', 'fading', 'cheap', 'television', 'heard', 'wall', 'by-the-hour', 'motel', 'nothing', 'movie', 'even', 'remotely', 'recommend', 'only', 'having', 'been', 'four', 'days', 'new', 'year', 'when', 'watched', 'feel', 'confident', 'stating', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'five', 'worst', 'movies', 'see', '2009', 'star', 'finished', 'when', 'can', 'actually', 'hear', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'not', 'too', 'bad']",Dark Fields

Her and some of her immature pimply faced friends are headed out to a concert when they run out of gas near a creepy abandoned farm house. The driver, Drew (Ryan Hulshof) goes up to the house to attempt to get some assistance. When he doesn't return, the kids come after him. This was your basic slasher formula. The kids in fact joke about it as they look around. The dialouge was immature, and I thought realistic to the point of being bad. The slasher character was not developed at all. Who is he? How is he related to the kids? We find out about midway through the film when we are read an old newspaper clipping, something every good slasher keeps.The blood, killings, horror, and suspense just didn't make it.F-bomb, brief sex, no nudity, Jenna in a bra/ bare midriff in a sweetly tanned body.
