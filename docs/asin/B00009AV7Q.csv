753353,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B00009AV7Q,Anyechka,"[6, 6]","This film covers the 12-year period from 1925-37, and all of the struggles that the African-American porters who worked for the George Pullman Railroad Company went through on their way to becoming successfully unionised.  It seems so unthinkable and morally reprehensible that not so long ago in history, these hard-working men were allowed to be treated this way, like being beaten up, all called ""George"" instead of by their real names, ordered around, given tips for doing things like shining passengers' shoes or even barking like a dog, being at the white passengers' beck and call, being accused of stealing company property when it was the white passenger who had been attempting to steal the train's linens, and fired just because they'd dared to attend meetings about unionising.  And because of the situation at the time, they couldn't protest, since making only $60 a month was still better than having no job.When the movie starts, in 1925, American society is on the up-and-up, with unions, organised labor, and Socialism not exactly being very popular or approved-of causes, with a lot of hatred, mistrust, and fear directed towards them.  Initially, Asa Philip Randolph meets with a lot of resistance when trying to even start a movement for organising the porters.  However, he has the advantage of not being a porter and therefore being unable to be fired from that line of work, and he has such great organising skills and such persuasive and impassioned rhetoric that eventually even people who were initially against the idea come over to his side.  Along the way the porters and their allies have to put up with things like spies, attempted intimidation by the white men running the Pullman corporation, firings, accusations of Bolshevism, criminal violence, and attempted bribery by the Pullman execs who want Randolph to step down and stop what he's doing.  Even when things finally seem to be going their way when FDR is sworn in as president, with more sympathy for organised labor and the working-class, there are still obstacles put in their way by the white establishment, people who just can't grasp that this union is going to happen whether they like it or not, that there's much too much support for it for their old tactics of fear, intimidation, and random illegal unjustified firings to still succeed and go unprotested.  They thought it would or could never happen, but it finally did.This movie is a powerful and moving history lesson and should be required viewing for everyone, whatever their race.  Though there's still a lot of racism in America today, at least it's not as awful or as institutionalised as it was back in the Twenties and Thirties.  Thanks to people like A. Philip Randolph, Milton Webster, and Ashley Totten, today African-American laborers have a right to be paid more than just $60 a month, the right to speak up when they're mistreated by racists, and most of all the right to be treated like human beings instead of sub-humans all branded with the name George.",5,An important story,1161043200,"10 17, 2006",2006,3024,"['film', '12-year', 'period', '1925-37', 'struggles', 'African-American', 'porters', 'who', 'worked', 'George', 'Pullman', 'Railroad', 'Company', 'went', 'way', 'becoming', 'successfully', 'unionised', 'so', 'unthinkable', 'morally', 'reprehensible', 'not', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'history', 'hard-working', 'men', 'were', 'allowed', 'be', 'treated', 'way', 'being', 'beaten', 'up', 'called', 'George', 'instead', 'real', 'names', 'ordered', 'given', 'tips', 'doing', 'things', 'shining', 'passengers', 'shoes', 'even', 'barking', 'dog', 'being', 'white', 'passengers', 'beck', 'call', 'being', 'accused', 'stealing', 'company', 'property', 'when', 'was', 'white', 'passenger', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'attempting', 'steal', 'train', 'linens', 'fired', 'just', ""'d"", 'dared', 'attend', 'meetings', 'unionising', 'situation', 'time', 'could', ""n't"", 'protest', 'making', 'only', '60', 'month', 'was', 'still', 'better', 'having', 'job.When', 'movie', '1925', 'American', 'society', 'up-and-up', 'unions', 'organised', 'labor', 'Socialism', 'not', 'exactly', 'being', 'very', 'popular', 'approved-of', 'causes', 'lot', 'hatred', 'mistrust', 'fear', 'directed', 'towards', 'Initially', 'Asa', 'Philip', 'Randolph', 'lot', 'resistance', 'when', 'trying', 'even', 'start', 'movement', 'organising', 'porters', 'However', 'advantage', 'not', 'being', 'porter', 'therefore', 'being', 'unable', 'be', 'fired', 'line', 'work', 'such', 'great', 'organising', 'skills', 'such', 'persuasive', 'impassioned', 'rhetoric', 'eventually', 'even', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'initially', 'idea', 'come', 'side', 'way', 'porters', 'allies', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'things', 'spies', 'attempted', 'intimidation', 'white', 'men', 'running', 'Pullman', 'corporation', 'firings', 'accusations', 'Bolshevism', 'criminal', 'violence', 'attempted', 'bribery', 'Pullman', 'execs', 'who', 'want', 'Randolph', 'step', 'down', 'stop', 'what', 'doing', 'Even', 'when', 'things', 'finally', 'seem', 'be', 'going', 'way', 'when', 'FDR', 'sworn', 'president', 'more', 'sympathy', 'organised', 'labor', 'working-class', 'are', 'still', 'obstacles', 'put', 'way', 'white', 'establishment', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'grasp', 'union', 'going', 'happen', 'like', 'not', 'much', 'too', 'much', 'support', 'old', 'tactics', 'fear', 'intimidation', 'random', 'illegal', 'unjustified', 'firings', 'still', 'succeed', 'go', 'unprotested', 'thought', 'would', 'could', 'never', 'happen', 'finally', 'did.This', 'movie', 'powerful', 'moving', 'history', 'lesson', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'everyone', 'race', 'still', 'lot', 'racism', 'America', 'today', 'least', 'not', 'as', 'awful', 'as', 'institutionalised', 'was', 'back', 'Twenties', 'Thirties', 'Thanks', 'people', 'A.', 'Philip', 'Randolph', 'Milton', 'Webster', 'Ashley', 'Totten', 'today', 'African-American', 'laborers', 'have', 'right', 'be', 'paid', 'more', 'just', '60', 'month', 'right', 'speak', 'up', 'when', ""'re"", 'mistreated', 'racists', 'most', 'right', 'be', 'treated', 'human', 'beings', 'instead', 'sub-humans', 'branded', 'name', 'George']",N/A

So if you happen to have a job as a Pullman on the trains, you work that job with pride, you don't complain, and you keep your mouth shut.  It does not matter that you have your own name, it does not matter that you are seen as less then a man, it does not matter you have dirty shoes thrown at you to shine, you smile and you take it.  But what happens when you finally realize enough is enough?  What can you do, who do you turn to, how much are you willing to sacrifice to get what you truly deserve?  Will you continue to stand for what you believe in, no matter how much others will dissuade you, or beat you down?Those are the questions that will be asked while watching this film.  I found this to be a poignant film.  I don't have Showtime, and I had never heard of this film, and found a copy in the library.  I enjoyed this film so much I plan to add this to my collection.  The historical content alone is what kept me riveted to the screen, and you feel the pain of the men in this film.  I mean to have your own name, but to be called ""George"" every day, and working for a meager $60 a month?  The acting in this film is stellar. The only reason I'm not giving this film a 5 is because I felt it could have been a little longer.  Andre Braugher is a great actor, and one who should receive more accolades.  Mario Van Peebles does his best performance in this film especially.  Mario is an excellent actor who needs to make better film choices.  I have yet to see Charles Dutton in a bad film role.

Led by A. Philip Randolph, who would later become a legendary figure for civil and labor rights, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters would endure hardship and opposition to become a recognized union in 1937.This Showtime Presentation is a must see for today's dwindling labor force in the United States. It's a throwback to a time in our country when big business caused an economic depression and a new President with new ideas helped energize the country back to work. Sound sort of familiar?The sleeping car porters began their struggle during a time of excessive corporate profits and greed. They managed to continue to organize and fight for fair employment after the historic stock market crash of 1929 and the great depression that followed. Remember, this was considered one of the better jobs available to young black men. Imagine some of the other jobs and the treatment blacks had to tolerate.The 1930's saw many unions challenge big business, but this was the first black led organization that would eventually receive the backing of the American Federation of Labor union (AFL).  The AFL at the time was the largest union grouping in the United States, and I assume it was predominantly white.Who knew that this early stroke of success for labor and equal rights would someday lead to a great man in 1963 making a stunning speech about a dream he had, in front of millions in Washington D.C.?
