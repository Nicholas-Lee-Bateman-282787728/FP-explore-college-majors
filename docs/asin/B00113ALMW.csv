1129418,ASL6Q1E97SYUE,B00113ALMW,J. Trobliger,"[0, 0]","The gorilla is my favorite.  It has one beautiful story called the Rainbabies that is just lovely, but may be a bit intense for a very young (2-3 year old) child. It is a beautiful story that I hope you likes when he is older.  There area few scenes when the babies are in danger by fire, swept to sea and that worried my son more than I thought it would.  Tha being said, I love this DVD and recommend it.",5,These stories are very cute.,1373068800,"07 6, 2013",2013,406,"['gorilla', 'favorite', 'one', 'beautiful', 'story', 'called', 'Rainbabies', 'just', 'lovely', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'intense', 'very', 'young', '2-3', 'year', 'old', 'child', 'beautiful', 'story', 'hope', 'likes', 'when', 'older', 'area', 'few', 'scenes', 'when', 'babies', 'are', 'danger', 'fire', 'swept', 'sea', 'worried', 'son', 'more', 'thought', 'would', 'Tha', 'being', 'said', 'love', 'DVD', 'recommend']",Good Night Gorilla... and More Great Sleepytime Stories

It's a great &#34;go to bed&#34; story and also fun for daytime as well.

Now at seven months my son seems to prefer the happy birthday moon story a little more, another good one by our review.
