It was also sadly one of her last movies.  In IT'S A PLEASURE, Henie co-stars with affable Michael O'Shea and the scene-stealing Iris Adrian.Sonja Henie stars as Chris Linden, a talented skater who falls in love with Don Martin (Michael O'Shea), a drunken hockey player who gets disqualified from the sport after he beats up the referee.  It's a standard ""Star is Born"" story but given lots of life thanks to Henie and O'Shea's winning chemistry.  Musical theatre singer Bill Johnson (as the ice-troupe manager) and Marie McDonald (his coldly-manipulative wife) are also impressive.Sonja Henie, always so youthful and innocent in her early vehicles like ""Second Fiddle"" and ""Sun Valley Serenade"" is allowed to show a more mature, dramatic side to her personality in this movie.  Three years later she'd appear in her final movie (""The Countess of Monte Cristo"") before going into semi-retirement.One for the Sonja fans.",3,Sonja saves the day in this minor musical,1243814400,"06 1, 2009",2009,1039,"['very', 'minor', 'movie', 'be', 'sure', 'noteworthy', 'Sonja', 'Henie', 'fans', 'only', 'film', 'did', 'Technicolor', 'was', 'also', 'sadly', 'one', 'last', 'movies', 'IT', 'A', 'PLEASURE', 'Henie', 'co-stars', 'affable', 'Michael', ""O'Shea"", 'scene-stealing', 'Iris', 'Adrian.Sonja', 'Henie', 'Chris', 'Linden', 'talented', 'skater', 'who', 'love', 'Don', 'Martin', 'Michael', ""O'Shea"", 'drunken', 'hockey', 'player', 'who', 'disqualified', 'sport', 'up', 'referee', 'standard', 'Star', 'Born', 'story', 'given', 'lots', 'life', 'thanks', 'Henie', ""O'Shea"", 'winning', 'chemistry', 'Musical', 'theatre', 'singer', 'Bill', 'Johnson', 'ice-troupe', 'manager', 'Marie', 'McDonald', 'coldly-manipulative', 'wife', 'are', 'also', 'impressive.Sonja', 'Henie', 'always', 'so', 'youthful', 'innocent', 'early', 'vehicles', 'Second', 'Fiddle', 'Sun', 'Valley', 'Serenade', 'allowed', 'show', 'more', 'mature', 'dramatic', 'side', 'personality', 'movie', 'Three', 'years', 'later', ""'d"", 'appear', 'final', 'movie', 'Countess', 'Monte', 'Cristo', 'going', 'semi-retirement.One', 'Sonja', 'fans']",It's a Pleasure VHS
408973,A91BK8S5QH98K,6304237685,CelticWomanFanPiano,"[0, 0]","I've seen most of Sonja Henie's movies and often they have very clever plots and are well done.  So why, out of all of her movies, this one is on DVD is beyond me.  Yes, it is one of the few that is in color, but it features one of the worst plots I've seen her movies have.  She's a doormat to an alcoholic no good husband.  We are expected to believe that she has a positive effect on him, but there is never a real reason for her to be so madly in love with him.  She ""mothers"" him, which they tout in the film, but it seems ridiculous given that most wild men don't want to be Mothered. And the ""other"" woman is quite evil, though not for any clear cut reason.  Other than she doesn't want anybody else to be happy.  Which is realistic, but a drag in this film.  Furthermore, while Sonja has a charming smile, her ice skating is awkward with broken lines and hunched over shoulders.  While a worldwide champion in the art/sport multiple times back in her day, nowadays her skating leaves much to desire.  I recommend several of her other films, but this one is a waste of time.",2,In color but not good.,1317340800,"09 30, 2011",2011,1081,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'Sonja', 'Henie', 'movies', 'often', 'have', 'very', 'clever', 'plots', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'So', 'why', 'movies', 'one', 'DVD', 'Yes', 'one', 'few', 'color', 'one', 'worst', 'plots', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', 'have', 'doormat', 'alcoholic', 'good', 'husband', 'are', 'expected', 'believe', 'positive', 'effect', 'never', 'real', 'reason', 'be', 'so', 'madly', 'love', 'mothers', 'tout', 'film', 'ridiculous', 'given', 'most', 'wild', 'men', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'Mothered', 'other', 'woman', 'quite', 'evil', 'not', 'clear', 'cut', 'reason', 'Other', ""n't"", 'want', 'anybody', 'else', 'be', 'happy', 'Which', 'realistic', 'drag', 'film', 'Furthermore', 'Sonja', 'charming', 'smile', 'ice', 'skating', 'awkward', 'broken', 'lines', 'hunched', 'shoulders', 'worldwide', 'champion', 'art/sport', 'multiple', 'times', 'back', 'day', 'skating', 'leaves', 'much', 'desire', 'recommend', 'several', 'other', 'films', 'one', 'waste', 'time']",It's a Pleasure VHS

408975,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,6304237685,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[16, 17]","""It's A Pleasure""(RKO, 1945)-------------------------------This is an unusually robust, earthy film for Norwegian skating sensation Sonia Henie... Her other films tended to be pretty goodie-two-shoesy, but this late WWII flick has a pretty salty script, apparently influenced by the hard-bitten film noir genre of the time. Here, Henie is a hardworking professional figure skater who falls for a hard-drinking, roughneck hockey player whose bad temper and alcoholism gets him banned from the sport (played by Michael O'Shea).  He in turn is pursued by the trampy, sexually aggressive wife of one of his best friends, who plies him with booze and (apparently) leads him astray. The dialogue is full of both implied and surprisingly direct rawness -- hardly the family-friendly fare of Henie's earlier films. All in all, pretty entertaining!  You might be surprised at how racy the plot is... the skating's pretty fine, too!

Of course it`s Sonja`s show and she carries it of beautifully, though her dramatic depth as an actress might be questioned hehehe.

McDonald suffered from too many ex-husbands and eventually committed suicide by the early 60s...
