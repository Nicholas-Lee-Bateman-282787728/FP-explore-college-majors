756100,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00009OWJR,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Michael J. Fox is a childhood favorite of mine, so it's a little surprising Bright Lights, Big City isn't that great of a movie.  Without Michael starring in this movie however, it would have been a lot worse.  I feel given how much I admired him in the 80's, I can't really criticize this movie as much as I would had someone else starred in it.  He was obviously gaining popularity back then due to the Back to the Future movies being so successful, as well as the final season of Family Ties airing soon after.  However I suppose every actor stars in a film that's less than satisfactory, and this unfortunately is the case for poor Michael.It's about a man played by Michael J. Fox who struggles with his job as a magazine writer (though to be fair his boss is perhaps the crankiest old lady of all-time) and if he makes one single mistake, well, let's just say perfection is the most important aspect of his career.  It's a requirement to be perfect.  Yeah right, since we're all perfect, right?  He's not allowed to make many, if any, mistakes hence the reason his boss is the worst person ever.  Then again who knows if magazine writer bosses really are that strict?  Perhaps they are.Anyway poor Michael struggles with the stress of perfection, and eventually finds himself spending time in nightclubs for most of the first half.  Now the movie is supposed to be about Michael developing a drug addiction to help him cope with the stress of his job, as well as coping with a girlfriend who unexpectedly left him high and dry due to her achieving bigger dreams of her own (played by the adorable Phoebe Cates) but it takes SUCH a long time to get to the meat and potatoes of the storyline that for the most part the film basically dissolves into your typical 80's nonsensical partying.We're supposed to feel bad about Michael having all these problems, but until a certain scene at the end with Michael's dying mother (truly the most hard-hitting emotional moment in the entire film) it's hard to really emphasize with Michael.  Even worse is that Kiefer Sutherland plays a know-it-all arrogant jerk who believes he can score with any chick, which is unintentionally hilarious given the success he'd later have with the 24 series.  But even worse, his character being present makes it hard to feel sorry for Michael's problems.  Kiefer's character delivers a little bit of entertainment perhaps, but at the expense of making us feel less sorry for Michael's more realistic/serious problems.  Basically Kiefer's out of place and never should have been written into the script.There is one really funny scene when Kiefer and Michael come up with this idea to release a wild animal in the bosses office late at night only for the plan to totally backfire in more ways than one, haha.  Worth it for this moment alone (along with the scene we see of Michael sitting by his dying mom's bedside, but for entirely different reasons).  I suppose the film does succeed to a lesser extent in blending happiness, sadness and frustration together, even though the overlong ""frustated Michael roams around his office floor"" segments aren't really presented in a way that's truly remarkable.  However, many 80's films are guilty of the same mumbo jumbo- too much pointless nonsense and never getting to the point.The first half of Bright Lights, Big City is really uninteresting though.  Not much happens then- it's all about the second half or rather, as soon as the animal segment I mention above occurs.  Starting then the movie improves.  Thank goodness Michael J. Fox is the guy playing the role of a stressed out magazine writer.  His talented and believable facial expressions concerning all these emotions is enough to elevate this movie by 2 extra points (I would have given it a 1, *maybe* a 2 with some other guy starring in it).Overall Bright Lights, Big City falls short of being able to stand out in any truly memorable way due to some flaws, but a couple segments make it worth your time.",3,not one of the better movies out there,1386547200,"12 9, 2013",2013,3995,"['Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'childhood', 'favorite', 'mine', 'little', 'surprising', 'Bright', 'Lights', 'Big', 'City', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'Michael', 'starring', 'movie', 'however', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'worse', 'feel', 'given', 'how', 'much', 'admired', '80', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'criticize', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'had', 'someone', 'else', 'starred', 'was', 'obviously', 'gaining', 'popularity', 'back', 'then', 'due', 'Back', 'Future', 'movies', 'being', 'so', 'successful', 'as', 'well', 'final', 'season', 'Family', 'Ties', 'airing', 'soon', 'However', 'suppose', 'actor', 'film', 'less', 'satisfactory', 'unfortunately', 'case', 'poor', 'Michael.It', 'man', 'played', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'who', 'job', 'magazine', 'writer', 'be', 'fair', 'boss', 'perhaps', 'crankiest', 'old', 'lady', 'all-time', 'one', 'single', 'mistake', 'well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'perfection', 'most', 'important', 'aspect', 'career', 'requirement', 'be', 'perfect', 'Yeah', 'right', ""'re"", 'perfect', 'right', 'not', 'allowed', 'make', 'many', 'mistakes', 'hence', 'reason', 'boss', 'worst', 'person', 'ever', 'Then', 'again', 'who', 'magazine', 'writer', 'bosses', 'really', 'are', 'strict', 'Perhaps', 'are.Anyway', 'poor', 'Michael', 'stress', 'perfection', 'eventually', 'spending', 'time', 'nightclubs', 'most', 'first', 'half', 'Now', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'Michael', 'developing', 'drug', 'addiction', 'help', 'cope', 'stress', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'coping', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'unexpectedly', 'left', 'high', 'dry', 'due', 'achieving', 'bigger', 'dreams', 'own', 'played', 'adorable', 'Phoebe', 'Cates', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'meat', 'potatoes', 'storyline', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'basically', 'typical', '80', 'nonsensical', 'partying.We', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'feel', 'bad', 'Michael', 'having', 'problems', 'certain', 'scene', 'end', 'Michael', 'dying', 'mother', 'truly', 'most', 'hard-hitting', 'emotional', 'moment', 'entire', 'film', 'hard', 'really', 'emphasize', 'Michael', 'Even', 'worse', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'know-it-all', 'arrogant', 'jerk', 'who', 'can', 'score', 'chick', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious', 'given', 'success', ""'d"", 'later', 'have', '24', 'series', 'even', 'worse', 'character', 'being', 'present', 'hard', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Michael', 'problems', 'Kiefer', 'character', 'little', 'bit', 'entertainment', 'perhaps', 'expense', 'making', 'feel', 'less', 'sorry', 'Michael', 'more', 'realistic/serious', 'problems', 'Basically', 'Kiefer', 'place', 'never', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'script.There', 'one', 'really', 'funny', 'scene', 'when', 'Kiefer', 'Michael', 'come', 'up', 'idea', 'release', 'wild', 'animal', 'bosses', 'office', 'late', 'night', 'only', 'plan', 'totally', 'backfire', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'haha', 'moment', 'alone', 'scene', 'see', 'Michael', 'sitting', 'dying', 'mom', 'bedside', 'entirely', 'different', 'reasons', 'suppose', 'film', 'succeed', 'lesser', 'extent', 'blending', 'happiness', 'sadness', 'frustration', 'together', 'even', 'overlong', 'frustated', 'Michael', 'roams', 'office', 'floor', 'segments', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'presented', 'way', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'However', 'many', '80', 'films', 'are', 'guilty', 'same', 'mumbo', 'jumbo-', 'too', 'much', 'pointless', 'nonsense', 'never', 'getting', 'point.The', 'first', 'half', 'Bright', 'Lights', 'Big', 'City', 'really', 'uninteresting', 'though', 'Not', 'much', 'then-', 'second', 'half', 'rather', 'as', 'soon', 'animal', 'segment', 'mention', 'occurs', 'Starting', 'then', 'movie', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'guy', 'playing', 'role', 'stressed', 'out', 'magazine', 'writer', 'talented', 'believable', 'facial', 'expressions', 'concerning', 'emotions', 'enough', 'elevate', 'movie', '2', 'extra', 'points', 'would', 'have', 'given', '1', '*maybe*', '2', 'other', 'guy', 'starring', '.Overall', 'Bright', 'Lights', 'Big', 'City', 'short', 'being', 'able', 'stand', 'out', 'truly', 'memorable', 'way', 'due', 'flaws', 'couple', 'segments', 'make', 'time']",N/A

756103,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B00009OWJR,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[1, 2]","This is an interesting movie in that it shows us how weak we can be about the plainest points when we are emotionally involved.The story is basically this. Jamie Conway (Michael J. Fox) is struggling to keep an editing job he doesn't especially like. Though he does need it. His boss Claire is less than kind, though not quite a monster. She is often nasty, though she does seem to give him the benefit of the doubt sometimes, and she does tolerate his lateness to work that seems to have increased.Later, we learn that Michael J. Fox is broken emotionally because his wife Amanda left him. Though we can readily see that she was just using him because she thought Fox would make it big as a writer, and as it turned out, she made it big as a model and decided she had no more use for Fox. This is where things get interesting. Because Fox is emotionally involved, he can't see that his wife was just an opportunist who was after anyone who could either support her, or move her into opportunities. So, he dwells and dwells on her to the point where he can not go on with his life.This brings us to Ted Alagash. (Kiefer Sutherland) The movie seems to lead us into more sympathy with Fox. And at times, Sutherland does seem insensitive, and yes he does have a harsh sense of humor about Fox's sadness. But if we allow ourselves to be objective, we can see that Sutherland is tired of hearing about Fox's wife, and Sutherland is basically trying to tell Fox: ""Enough! Go on with your life already!""An obvious example is when Sutherland asks Fox to go out with his attractive cousin. Sutherland outlines the situation nicely when he makes this comment about Amanda: ""God knows she wasn't hard to look at. I don't know why you felt you had to marry her though.""Throughout the movie, Fox, Sutherland, and their friends are portrayed as drug users. But a fine point worth considering is that Sutherland controls his drug intake. With Fox, it is clear that the drugs are controlling him. (It is also worth noting that Fox was into drugs before his wife left him.)Things go from bad to worse as Fox loses his job. But he is still obsessed with his wife. I don't want to ruin the movie for those of you who haven't seen it, but there is an interesting outcome.I'll just say that sometimes triumph comes from stepping outside of ourselves and realizing that there is more to life than our own existence.One complaint I have about the movie is that at one point near the end, Fox compares Sutherland to Amanda which makes no sense. Amanda left Fox because there were offers that she considered better for her. Throughout the movie, Sutherland has been trying to convince Fox to go on with his life. Yes, his humor is harsh at times. But often, that is a way people use to tell others how absurd they are being in their self pity.While not perfect, it is certainly interesting.",3,Go On With Your Life Already!,1235606400,"02 26, 2009",2009,2865,"['interesting', 'movie', 'how', 'weak', 'can', 'be', 'plainest', 'points', 'when', 'are', 'emotionally', 'involved.The', 'story', 'basically', 'Jamie', 'Conway', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'struggling', 'keep', 'editing', 'job', ""n't"", 'especially', 'like', 'need', 'boss', 'Claire', 'less', 'kind', 'not', 'monster', 'often', 'nasty', 'seem', 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'sometimes', 'tolerate', 'lateness', 'work', 'have', 'increased.Later', 'learn', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'broken', 'emotionally', 'wife', 'Amanda', 'left', 'can', 'readily', 'see', 'was', 'just', 'using', 'thought', 'Fox', 'would', 'make', 'big', 'writer', 'turned', 'out', 'made', 'big', 'model', 'decided', 'had', 'more', 'use', 'Fox', 'where', 'things', 'get', 'interesting', 'Fox', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'wife', 'was', 'just', 'opportunist', 'who', 'was', 'anyone', 'who', 'could', 'either', 'support', 'move', 'opportunities', 'So', 'dwells', 'point', 'where', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'life.This', 'Ted', 'Alagash', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'movie', 'lead', 'more', 'sympathy', 'Fox', 'times', 'Sutherland', 'seem', 'insensitive', 'yes', 'have', 'harsh', 'sense', 'humor', 'Fox', 'sadness', 'allow', 'be', 'objective', 'can', 'see', 'Sutherland', 'tired', 'hearing', 'Fox', 'wife', 'Sutherland', 'basically', 'trying', 'tell', 'Fox', 'Enough', 'Go', 'life', 'already', 'obvious', 'example', 'when', 'Sutherland', 'Fox', 'go', 'out', 'attractive', 'cousin', 'Sutherland', 'situation', 'nicely', 'when', 'comment', 'Amanda', 'God', 'was', ""n't"", 'hard', 'look', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'felt', 'had', 'marry', 'though', 'movie', 'Fox', 'Sutherland', 'friends', 'are', 'portrayed', 'drug', 'users', 'fine', 'point', 'worth', 'considering', 'Sutherland', 'drug', 'intake', 'Fox', 'clear', 'drugs', 'are', 'controlling', 'also', 'worth', 'noting', 'Fox', 'was', 'drugs', 'wife', 'left', 'Things', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'Fox', 'job', 'still', 'obsessed', 'wife', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'movie', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'interesting', 'outcome.I', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'sometimes', 'triumph', 'stepping', 'ourselves', 'realizing', 'more', 'life', 'own', 'existence.One', 'complaint', 'have', 'movie', 'one', 'point', 'end', 'Fox', 'Sutherland', 'Amanda', 'sense', 'Amanda', 'left', 'Fox', 'were', 'offers', 'considered', 'better', 'movie', 'Sutherland', 'been', 'trying', 'convince', 'Fox', 'go', 'life', 'Yes', 'humor', 'harsh', 'times', 'often', 'way', 'people', 'use', 'tell', 'others', 'how', 'absurd', 'are', 'being', 'self', 'not', 'perfect', 'certainly', 'interesting']",N/A
756104,A3GPR7GJ6HGVEY,B00009OWJR,"Burt Lee Liberty ""Artsy Leftist""","[1, 3]","I came into this film knowing very little. I had read something online about the cocaine use, someone comparing it with Scarface in some capacity. So I did the math: Michael J. Fox using cocaine in the 1980s=yeah, I'll give it a view.The movie opens strong with some scenes of nightclub indulgence and a good shot of Michael staring at himself in the mirror, lights glaring; and we can tell there's some thought behind the camera.Fox tries to work at a magazine but is conflicted between it and the lights of the city. It doesn't help that he has a very earthly Keifer Sutherland goading him on, seducing easily like Satan, seeming to epitomize the city life. It's easy to imagine how many people in the 1980s could easily be strung along by such dopes. Destruction can be a collective effort. The clubbing goes on.More is revealed in time about the Fox character, and it emerges that this film is not only about partying. His co-workers at the magazine look at him funny. He stands out.Megan, his friend at the magazine, is inexplicably motherly to him. She's a good friend, but one wonders why she would care about the coke addled Fox of the night. She must see something more in him.Fox tries to write a novel, but it's tough. His wife has left him, an innocent who was swallowed by the city. There's an effective scene where he finds her, strutting on the catwalk, cameras going wild. She ignores him.All in all, this is an enjoyable view of a human in an inhuman place.

I'm happy to say that the movie is better than the book, or quite possibly, the book was better than I remembered it.  Abetted by brilliant direction by James Bridges, McInnerney's script masterfully fleshes out the novel to the screen.  All would be for naught if we didn't empathize with the central character, Jamie Conway, frustrated magazine editor and fledgling writer portrayed here by Michael J. Fox.  Fox with few histrionics captures the melancholy and desperation of a young man whose life is falling apart and also has to cope with the recent death of his mother and the breakup of his brief marriage.  The supporting cast here is impeccable that it's difficult to single anybody out.

His wife left him, his job is beginning to fall apart and he is living in this phase where he is using drugs and booze to wash away painful memories that he would like to avoid. This is a sad movie. Phoebe Cates was perfect in her role. It was a smaller role than I expected... I mean her character has a huge impact on Jaime, but she isn't in the movie very much. The times where she is present she plays the role of a self absorbed model-to-be perfectly. She always has this smirk on her face that just really sums up how vapid she is. This movie was also scary. With a job falling apart and a personal life that is a total mess, there is always the temptation to just sort of give up on things and live in the present. Looking for fun to hide the pain, only the fun that Jaime seeks is impossible to obtain. Drugs and booze become his crutch and the the fast life of New York in the 80's becomes his life... until he realizes that this is not a way to live, this is a way to die.

While in The Secret of My Success he was a lovable yuppie scum from Kansas, here he is a not so lovable yuppie scum from Kansas who is absorbed in the heady nightlife of cocaine and all that was New York in the 80s.  He is in despair, as his job is going downhill, his wife has left him, there are no friends to be found, and it's all falling apart.It's hard for me to feel sympathy for someone like this.  He made choices to live this way.  His use of drugs was not the result of abuse, desperation or being forced into doing something he didn't want to do, it was the result of his own choices.  His wife left him because she doesn't want to watch him go down.  His friends are not really his friends, and he is loosing footing with his job.  ""What? Me? Get up and go to work? I don't like the way you said that, I'm not going.""  And the coke straw says ""You know you're right.""  Michael J Fox seems to be someone who has had a lot of advantages in life and he is throwing them away for the next high.  I've watched many friends ruin their lives with this, and none of them are my friends anymore because of their choices.  I choose to live in happiness, to be in the light, and to be responsible enough to support myself.  Guess what?  That's cool and they're not.Why not one star?  In terms of a cinematic achievement, they were able to capture the paranoia and upset that is cocain addiction so the audience is able to experience it for themselves.  A few movies have been able to achieve this, such as Good Fellas and Boogie Nights, and this movie for that alone has fallen into the slush pile.

Fox (Back To The Future), Phoebe Cates (Fast Times At Ridgemont High), and Keifer Sutherland (The Lost Boys, Stand By Me) in this overlooked 80's movie about a man's struggle with a dark past and the overwhelmingly hysterical cocaine-driven nightlife of New York City.Fox plays Jamie Conway, a struggling writer and editor in a small time magazine, who has just been dumped by his big shot model wife Amanda and is still mourning the death of his mother from cancer a year ago. He's also concerned with a newspaper article following the tragic events of a pregnant woman in coma simply because it reminds him of the last conversation between him and his dying mother about how painful it was for her to give birth to him because he ""didn't want to get out"".The events of the movie pursue Jamie on his manic pursuit of Amanda and the fact that he feels used and terribly upset with the way she left him, and his dreadful shortcomings at work that cost him his job. The main focus of the movie however is how addicted Jamie gets to cocaine and the negative results it has on his health. Keifer Sutherland plays Aligash, a suave businessman who joins Jamie in the crazy nightlife scene and ends up hooking him up with a woman that seems to be what Jamie was looking for for a long time.Although the movie might seem plotless, it captures a certain vibe that you can't seem to pull away from.

Forget about getting up and going to work tomorrow, where's the party? Humorous, compelling, and sad, with a marvelously redemptive ending. I'm not a big fan of Michael J. Fox, but I have to say this is the biggest role, in a small film, of his entire career. Forget TEENWOLF, this is great acting. Especially compelling is his soliloquy as he reassesses his marriage while he's swinging around a wine glass and bouncing off the walls of his living room. Great stuff. The funniest scene is when Sutherland is looking for coke in the dust of Fox's apartment and takes a freeze to the gums. Wow. Been there, done that.If you think the book was better than the movie, think again. The screenplay was written by the author, Jay McInerney. So it actually resembles the novel. Nice job.And those of you who think this is a stretch for Fox, think again. Michael had his own coke problem which is what drew him to this role in the first place. Great job, Michael. I think this the most mature performance of your career. Best of luck to you, brother. Sutherland is great too.And yes, I'm in total agreement with previous reviewers, this begs to be rereleased in widescreen.Don't be fooled by the lackluster reviews for this flick, it's one of the best films ever made about being lost in addiction.
