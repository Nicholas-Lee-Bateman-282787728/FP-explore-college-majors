But this DVD contains one of the richest-sounding and most slickly produced sacred choral music concerts I've ever seen. All of the classic Latin hymns from Panis Angelicus to Ave Maria, along with some rollicking secular vernacular songs, are here. But the difference with this program is that it looks and sounds brilliant from start to finish. The three priests have pristine voices, of course, but they are also surrounded here by world-class singers and musicians, and their combined songs with famed headliners like Sir James Galway and Moya Brennan create a very satisfying sound. This 2009 live concert, aired in the United States on PBS, was recorded at St. Patrick Cathedral in Armagh, Northern Ireland. I'm not sure if the concert sounds so good because of the cathedral's acoustics, or because of the recording setup, or because of the Dolby 5.1 sound mix on this disc, or because of a combination of all these factors. I only know that this DVD exceeds all of the similar concert recordings I've seen by Andrea Bocelli, Charlotte Church, and the Three Tenors in terms of its overall sound quality. It is also pretty entertaining, as the three priests display surprising charisma, offering charming introductions and occasional comments during the program. A particular highlight is when they dedicate a song to the 93-year old Catholic sister who taught them music as boys, who is sitting there in the audience, and then one of them greets her after the song. It's a pleasure to see good music performed in such a warm, heartfelt, and inspiring fashion.
