1356670,A3ANETCTMAN1NP,B003PDMV74,&#308;&#308;,"[55, 57]","After Julianne's fantastic ballroom workout last year, I was eager to try out this DVD which had more of a jazzy hip hop feel to it.  It turned out to be just as good as her first DVD, and it gave me a high impact workout that was difficult (definitely not beginner-friendly) and fun to do!Julianne is a great instructor with her contagious enthusiasm and genuine friendliness.  She doesn't have the best cueing in the world, but it can be overlooked because of her personality.I do want to mention the music on this DVD.  It was techno music which I know a lot of people don't like in workout videos.  However, this techno was incredibly funky and fun to dance, and I think that exercisers will enjoy the music despite that fact that it is considered techno.The choreography is very difficult to master on the DVD.  There is barely any breakdown (except for the private dance lesson), and the moves are intricate on top of being very fast.  It is not for beginners at all.  However, it is fun and high cardio.  Each routine is 4 8-counts long.Now for a breakdown of the workout DVD:Warm-Up - This was very basic and easy to follow with its simple neck and hip rolls, stretches to the side, and leg stretches.Work It - This first routine is high cardio with some amazingly fun moves that include a kick snake, hip shake, standing crunch step, tap out tap in, step forward then grab your ankle and roll up, skaters, and hip rolls.  It's very jazzy and very fun; this was my favorite routine.Flaunt It - In this routine, there actually is a breakdown (somewhat) of the moves, as the moves are gradually built into full combos.  A little bit lower cardio in addition to being more symmetrical, but it is still very active and tricky.  The moves are march forward, jump out, hip shakes, FAST three step turn with sweep, three step turn/sweep other way, box step, booty slaps, neck roll, and flick.Pump It - This routine is definitely the best in terms of cardio since the moves are big and fast.  The moves go back to not really being broken down so it's a little hard but still fun.  The steps in this routine would be a jump kick, two poses then a pause before two more poses, jump together, contraction that moves into chest pumps, football with head and arms, the monkey (a step knee with swinging arms), and a tap in out in out.Cool Down - Like the warm up, this is very easy, and it is also very relaxing.  It contains some upward reaches, shoulder rolls, back rolls down, leg and back stretches, arm stretches.Personal Dance Lesson - This potion simply has Julianne really break down four moves slowly and teach them to you.  The four moves taught are the kick snake, three step turn, jump kick, and skaters.A trailer for the DVD, and a backstage interview with Julianne are included on the DVD.Overall, this workout is amazing in terms of cardio, and the choreography is complex, too.  It's very dancy with a jazz funk feel to it that should allow exercisers and dancers to have a blast!",5,"A challenging, high cardio jazz funk workout",1287014400,"10 14, 2010",2010,2991,"['Julianne', 'fantastic', 'ballroom', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'eager', 'try', 'out', 'DVD', 'had', 'more', 'jazzy', 'hip', 'hop', 'feel', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'DVD', 'gave', 'high', 'impact', 'was', 'difficult', 'definitely', 'not', 'beginner-friendly', 'fun', 'do', 'Julianne', 'great', 'instructor', 'contagious', 'enthusiasm', 'genuine', 'friendliness', ""n't"", 'have', 'best', 'cueing', 'world', 'can', 'be', 'overlooked', 'personality.I', 'do', 'want', 'mention', 'music', 'DVD', 'was', 'techno', 'music', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'workout', 'videos', 'However', 'techno', 'was', 'incredibly', 'funky', 'fun', 'dance', 'think', 'exercisers', 'will', 'enjoy', 'music', 'fact', 'considered', 'techno.The', 'choreography', 'very', 'difficult', 'master', 'DVD', 'barely', 'breakdown', 'private', 'dance', 'lesson', 'moves', 'are', 'intricate', 'top', 'being', 'very', 'fast', 'not', 'beginners', 'However', 'fun', 'high', 'cardio', 'routine', '4', '8-counts', 'long.Now', 'breakdown', 'workout', 'DVD', 'Warm-Up', 'was', 'very', 'basic', 'easy', 'follow', 'simple', 'neck', 'hip', 'rolls', 'stretches', 'side', 'leg', 'stretches.Work', 'first', 'routine', 'high', 'cardio', 'amazingly', 'fun', 'moves', 'include', 'kick', 'snake', 'hip', 'shake', 'standing', 'crunch', 'step', 'tap', 'out', 'tap', 'step', 'forward', 'then', 'grab', 'ankle', 'roll', 'up', 'skaters', 'hip', 'rolls', 'very', 'jazzy', 'very', 'fun', 'was', 'favorite', 'routine.Flaunt', 'routine', 'actually', 'breakdown', 'somewhat', 'moves', 'moves', 'are', 'gradually', 'built', 'full', 'combos', 'little', 'bit', 'lower', 'cardio', 'addition', 'being', 'more', 'symmetrical', 'still', 'very', 'active', 'tricky', 'moves', 'are', 'march', 'forward', 'jump', 'out', 'hip', 'shakes', 'FAST', 'three', 'step', 'turn', 'sweep', 'three', 'step', 'turn/sweep', 'other', 'way', 'box', 'step', 'booty', 'slaps', 'neck', 'roll', 'flick.Pump', 'routine', 'definitely', 'best', 'terms', 'cardio', 'moves', 'are', 'big', 'fast', 'moves', 'go', 'back', 'not', 'really', 'being', 'broken', 'down', 'little', 'hard', 'still', 'fun', 'steps', 'routine', 'would', 'be', 'jump', 'kick', 'two', 'poses', 'then', 'pause', 'two', 'more', 'poses', 'jump', 'together', 'contraction', 'chest', 'pumps', 'football', 'head', 'arms', 'monkey', 'step', 'knee', 'swinging', 'arms', 'tap', 'out', 'out.Cool', 'Down', 'warm', 'up', 'very', 'easy', 'also', 'very', 'relaxing', 'upward', 'reaches', 'shoulder', 'rolls', 'back', 'down', 'leg', 'back', 'stretches', 'arm', 'stretches.Personal', 'Dance', 'Lesson', 'potion', 'simply', 'Julianne', 'really', 'break', 'down', 'four', 'moves', 'slowly', 'teach', 'four', 'moves', 'are', 'kick', 'snake', 'three', 'step', 'turn', 'jump', 'kick', 'trailer', 'DVD', 'backstage', 'interview', 'Julianne', 'are', 'included', 'DVD.Overall', 'workout', 'amazing', 'terms', 'cardio', 'choreography', 'complex', 'too', 'very', 'dancy', 'jazz', 'funk', 'feel', 'should', 'allow', 'exercisers', 'dancers', 'have', 'blast']",N/A

It also included super fast spins that left me feeling out of control.  I am in good shape and have numerous dance DVDs.  I generally learn exercise routines quickly.

I thought this dance workout was particularly fun with a lot of sexy swaying moves that really work the core. It will also keep your heart pumping when you put your full energy into each move. Agree that there is not too much time spent on instruction which is a plus for me, as the moves are relatively easy to pick-up if you're familiar with dance, decreasing the boredom factor. It's like going to a party for an hour, but you're in the comfort of your home where you can dance with no inhibition. The more you do it, the better you get at it. Agree as the reviews say that it's too much for beginners but that's why I selected it. I always wonder why folks make negative comments like ""I threw it in the trash"" because it's simply for those at a more a more advanced level than they are.  I also disagree that it's for someone ""under 27"". I'm 56 and appreciate the music and and Julianne's style. Her personality is bubbly and she is very motivating, ""woohs"" and all .

The next thirty minutes or so comprise the cardio workout. Julianne teaches you three dance routines. The workout ends with about a five minute cool-down and stretch. This DVD also contains an optional short training session with Julianne where she shows you the basics of some of her steps.I am not a dancer. I run and do tae bo for my cardio. When I saw this DVD on sale, I figured why not give it a try to spice things up a bit. Overall Julianne is a great instructor and really breaks things down nicely. Here is a short list of  Pro's and Con's to this DVD.PROS: It is so much fun. It is over before you know it! You don't even realize you're sweating till it's over. The routine is not overly complex, and yet it is complex enough to give you something to work up to. You won't get it all in the first try, but that is a good thing-challenge is great. :-) It is a moderate workout, so if you are an advanced exercises it is good on days when you want to take it down a notch. The music is not annoying. For those who need modifications there is a girl who demonstrates ways to modify.CONS: While they filmed, they spent too much time zooming into Julianne's face and torso. This is frustrating while learning, because you need to watch her entire body to get the routine down. The entire workout is just over 40 minutes so you only get about 30 minutes of cardio (I like to aim for 60 minutes).Even with the short list of con's I am giving it five stars because of the great instruction and Julianne's ability to make exercise fun!

1356687,A3IKFQC64SS4WO,B003PDMV74,mcel,"[151, 154]","As a DWTS fan, and owning Julianne's first DVD, I HAD to get this one.This is Julianne's contemporary dance DVD workout, so no ballroom here. Again there is a warm up, cooldown and three dance segments, with a breakdown tutorial of the moves.The three dance sections are: Work It, Flaunt It and Pump It. Each section features techno-y dance music, and starts with one move to add another etc until the routine is complete.I have to be honest the first time I did this DVD, I wasn't too thrilled. I thought it was very difficult, and the steps were hard to get down, and yes I did watch the tutorial and I didn't find it a big help. I learn more by just doing the dance than breaking it down slowly; I learn more by doing the routine at full speed rather than a slow breakdown of the steps. But the first time, while the DVD was fun I found the choreo frustrating.I gave it a second chance because it did my heart pumping the first time and LOVED it!! My advice to anyone doing this is don't worry about doing it perfect everytime. Just have fun with the moves, which are truly ""music video"" worthy. Don't worry how you look, don't worry if it's perfect just go with it and you will get a great workout! Some examples: in the ""Flaunt It"" routine you have to do kind of a drag running step which is impossible on a carpet so I just adjusted it and did what I could. And even though I have previous dance experience (about 25 years worth) I know the difference between an experienced dancer (myself) and a professional one (Julianne) So do the moves to the best of your abilties, remember you're not Julianne, and don't hurt yourself!All in all this is a great workout and since it is so much fun the time flies by and by the end of it I am dripping sweat and didn't even realize it!Excellent buy, so worth it!!",4,Love it!

I was so excited to see that she was coming out with another one that as soon as I had a chance to pick it up I did! This is going to be a little more work then her first one but nothing that can't be picked up if you work at it hard enough. I have no dance experience and I am really not a good dancer at all. This dvd helps me work up a sweat even if I can't execute the moves as well as she can. I love that its broken up into 3 parts and has a warm up and cool down. As with her other dvd she has a short section that will give you pointers on some of the tougher moves and how you can get them right. I find these sections on both dvds very helpful. Sometimes when she is running through the routine you need just a little more time on some moves to get them down. She also has a dancer in the background that provides some modifications on the moves if you need them. I always appreciate when there is someone showing you another way of doing a move but you can still get a good workout in. I like Julianne's personality. The names of some of the moves are a little cheesy but its ok. She is sweet and makes the workout seem more like fun and less like a chore. I recommend this dvd for those days when you just don't want to head for the gym but need to get your cardio in. Both of her dvds are different so I don't have a preference for one over the other; I just like the fact that there are plenty of routines between the two so you won't get bored as quickly.,5,A Definite Workout!,1287705600,"10 22, 2010",2010,1544,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'Julianne', 'first', 'dvd', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'workout', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'see', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'one', 'as', 'soon', 'had', 'chance', 'pick', 'up', 'did', 'going', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'work', 'then', 'first', 'one', 'nothing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'picked', 'up', 'work', 'hard', 'enough', 'have', 'dance', 'experience', 'am', 'really', 'not', 'good', 'dancer', 'dvd', 'work', 'up', 'sweat', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'execute', 'moves', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'love', 'broken', 'up', '3', 'parts', 'warm', 'up', 'cool', 'down', 'other', 'dvd', 'short', 'section', 'will', 'give', 'pointers', 'tougher', 'moves', 'how', 'can', 'get', 'right', 'find', 'sections', 'dvds', 'very', 'helpful', 'Sometimes', 'when', 'running', 'routine', 'need', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'moves', 'get', 'down', 'also', 'dancer', 'background', 'modifications', 'moves', 'need', 'always', 'appreciate', 'when', 'someone', 'showing', 'way', 'doing', 'move', 'can', 'still', 'get', 'good', 'workout', 'like', 'Julianne', 'personality', 'names', 'moves', 'are', 'little', 'cheesy', 'ok.', 'sweet', 'workout', 'seem', 'more', 'fun', 'less', 'chore', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'days', 'when', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'head', 'gym', 'need', 'get', 'cardio', 'dvds', 'are', 'different', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'preference', 'one', 'other', 'just', 'fact', 'are', 'plenty', 'routines', 'two', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'bored', 'quickly']",N/A
