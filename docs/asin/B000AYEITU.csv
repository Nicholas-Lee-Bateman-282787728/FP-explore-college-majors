It's a real treat to see the shows as they were originally broadcast in Canada. Aside from the regular episodes there are two ""best of "" compilations on disk four, both with very interesting and amusing commentary from the performers. There is also footage of a live performance that pre dates their television program.Any Kids fan will want to own this and every other Season Set.",5,Kids are Klassy,1140652800,"02 23, 2006",2006,511,"['really', ""n't"", 'much', 'saying', 'Kids', 'Hall', 'are', 'best', 'ensemble', 'comedy', 'group', 'ever', 'come', 'North', 'America', 'real', 'treat', 'see', 'shows', 'were', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'Canada', 'Aside', 'regular', 'episodes', 'are', 'two', 'best', 'compilations', 'disk', 'four', 'very', 'interesting', 'amusing', 'commentary', 'performers', 'also', 'footage', 'live', 'performance', 'pre', 'dates', 'television', 'program.Any', 'Kids', 'fan', 'will', 'want', 'own', 'other', 'Season', 'Set']",Kids in the Hall - Complete Season 3 1991-1992

Younger folks who'd never known any better would often lament that the show wasn't really all that original, and I was beginning to agree with them until the DVDs came along to fill in the gaps in my memory. I always knew Comedy Central had censored the sketches horribly, but what I did not remember was just how many of them they never showed at all. The stuff they cut out is of course the best stuff.They really did a rush job on the DVD authoring, though. Compression artifacts like you wouldn't believe, and not a lot in the way of bonus features. Still well worth picking up.",4,Bad encoding,1186704000,"08 10, 2007",2007,760,"['nearly', 'decade', 'watching', 'same', 'overplayed', 'watered-down', 'versions', 'show', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'found', 'forgetting', 'just', 'how', 'funny', 'had', 'actually', 'been', 'HBO', 'Younger', 'folks', 'who', ""'d"", 'never', 'known', 'better', 'would', 'often', 'lament', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'all', 'original', 'was', 'beginning', 'agree', 'DVDs', 'came', 'along', 'fill', 'gaps', 'memory', 'always', 'knew', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'had', 'censored', 'sketches', 'horribly', 'what', 'did', 'not', 'remember', 'was', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'never', 'showed', 'stuff', 'cut', 'out', 'course', 'best', 'stuff.They', 'really', 'did', 'rush', 'job', 'DVD', 'authoring', 'though', 'Compression', 'would', ""n't"", 'believe', 'not', 'lot', 'way', 'bonus', 'features', 'Still', 'well', 'picking', 'up']",Kids in the Hall - Complete Season 3 1991-1992

KITH were still young and had a lot of freedom to do any stories on any topic. That's cool when you are young. I think season 1,2 were much better. All of them are older now despite that seasons seem still fresh. I wonder if they would still do same episodes or they would cut some of them out now. Mark McKinney is my favorite kid in the hall and it's a fact (though ""It's a fact girl"" segments got on my nerves).",1,unfunny,1194912000,"11 13, 2007",2007,531,"['expected', 'funnier', 'season', 'Most', 'stories', 'found', 'boring', 'annoying', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'maybe', 'just', 'get', 'older', 'KITH', 'were', 'still', 'young', 'had', 'lot', 'freedom', 'do', 'stories', 'topic', 'cool', 'when', 'are', 'young', 'think', 'season', '1,2', 'were', 'much', 'better', 'are', 'older', 'now', 'seasons', 'seem', 'still', 'fresh', 'wonder', 'would', 'still', 'do', 'same', 'episodes', 'would', 'cut', 'out', 'now', 'Mark', 'McKinney', 'favorite', 'kid', 'hall', 'fact', 'fact', 'girl', 'segments', 'got', 'nerves']",Kids in the Hall - Complete Season 3 1991-1992

934783,A3CYFDQZH4H5GL,B000AYEITU,SandmanVI,"[25, 27]","While some considered the 2nd season to be perhaps as funny but slightly less daring than the 1st, this time around everything seems to work perfectly. The concepts are as bold as ever, the insights at times are biting and cynical, the concepts are hilariously absurd yet often executed with nuance (a tough feat) and the boys just seem to have found the perfect chemistry. Their intelligent brand of oddball sketch comedy is now fully mastered coming off smoother than before while thankfully never losing the raw edge of the earlier work.The 4-disc format of the package remains exactly the same as the first 2 seasons with the actor commentary, compilations of favorite sketches, rare never-seen performances from the Rivoli Theater and cast bios alongside all of the episodes. It's a very solid set of added material though not a total home run in terms of extras; however it's what we've come to expect for the series at this point and the consistency is fine.Obviously this is a must for fans and I think you'll find this to be the most enjoyable of the 3 sets so far. For newcomers I think this is an easier place to dip into the weird world of KITH since the entire act is a bit more polished.",5,The Kids Hit Their Stride In Season 3!,1126742400,"09 15, 2005",2005,1201,"['considered', '2nd', 'season', 'be', 'perhaps', 'funny', 'slightly', 'less', 'daring', '1st', 'time', 'around', 'everything', 'work', 'perfectly', 'concepts', 'are', 'as', 'bold', 'ever', 'insights', 'times', 'are', 'biting', 'cynical', 'concepts', 'are', 'hilariously', 'absurd', 'yet', 'often', 'executed', 'nuance', 'tough', 'feat', 'boys', 'just', 'seem', 'have', 'found', 'perfect', 'chemistry', 'intelligent', 'brand', 'oddball', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'now', 'fully', 'mastered', 'coming', 'off', 'smoother', 'before', 'thankfully', 'never', 'losing', 'raw', 'edge', 'earlier', 'work.The', '4-disc', 'format', 'package', 'exactly', 'same', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'actor', 'commentary', 'compilations', 'favorite', 'sketches', 'rare', 'never-seen', 'performances', 'Rivoli', 'Theater', 'cast', 'bios', 'episodes', 'very', 'solid', 'set', 'added', 'material', 'not', 'total', 'home', 'run', 'terms', 'extras', 'however', 'what', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'series', 'point', 'consistency', 'fine.Obviously', 'must', 'fans', 'think', ""'ll"", 'find', 'be', 'most', 'enjoyable', '3', 'sets', 'so', 'far', 'newcomers', 'think', 'easier', 'place', 'dip', 'weird', 'world', 'KITH', 'entire', 'act', 'bit', 'more', 'polished']",Kids in the Hall - Complete Season 3 1991-1992
