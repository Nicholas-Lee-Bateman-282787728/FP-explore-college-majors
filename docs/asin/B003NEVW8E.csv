I'm a fan of the Beatles but I've only read bits and pieces of the conspiracy and thought it was quite interesting. The DVD PAUL MCCARTNEY REALLY IS DEAD is pretty cool for those who are intrigued by mysteries and conspiracy theories and stuff like that.A voice -- that's supposed to be George Harrison's -- narrates the film and talks about how the real Paul McCartney was killed in an auto accident and was replaced by a double because the UK's secret service didn't want mass suicides and riots to happen if the Beatles were no more. It describes how the double took Paul's place and how the rest of the group felt about it and why they kept up the charade. It also goes into the clues left on the album covers and song lyrics.There's footage and photographs and graphics that help explain the ""signs"" to look out for.Anyway, I wouldn't take it seriously but it's great fun to watch and then dig up your albums and look and listen for the clues. The voice kind of sounds like Harrison, but not really. Anyone who has ever listened to George talking during press conferences and on recording sessions knows that he's got a very distinct voice and though this one is sort of close, it really isn't.=====  SPECIAL FEATURES  =====* 10:06-minutes -- ""Bob Dylan Meets The Beatles""Interview with Al Aronowitz, rock reporter and friend to Dylan, talks about taking Dylan back to meet the Beatles, back in the 60s, and how Dylan turned them on to pot.Don't expect a pulitzer prize winning documentary out of this, but it's fun and interesting to watch.",4,Take It With A *Grain Of Salt* -- But Fun For Conspiracy Buffs!,1286236800,"10 5, 2010",2010,1645,"['Let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'am', 'means', 'expert', 'whole', 'Paul', 'Dead', 'conspiracy', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Beatles', ""'ve"", 'only', 'read', 'bits', 'pieces', 'conspiracy', 'thought', 'was', 'quite', 'interesting', 'DVD', 'PAUL', 'MCCARTNEY', 'REALLY', 'IS', 'DEAD', 'pretty', 'cool', 'who', 'are', 'intrigued', 'mysteries', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'stuff', 'that.A', 'voice', 'supposed', 'be', 'George', 'Harrison', 'film', 'talks', 'how', 'real', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'was', 'killed', 'auto', 'accident', 'was', 'replaced', 'double', 'UK', 'secret', 'service', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'mass', 'suicides', 'riots', 'happen', 'Beatles', 'were', 'more', 'how', 'double', 'took', 'Paul', 'place', 'how', 'rest', 'group', 'felt', 'why', 'kept', 'up', 'charade', 'also', 'clues', 'left', 'album', 'song', 'footage', 'photographs', 'graphics', 'help', 'explain', 'signs', 'look', 'out', 'for.Anyway', 'would', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'great', 'fun', 'watch', 'then', 'dig', 'up', 'albums', 'look', 'listen', 'clues', 'voice', 'kind', 'sounds', 'Harrison', 'not', 'really', 'Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'listened', 'George', 'talking', 'press', 'conferences', 'recording', 'sessions', 'got', 'very', 'distinct', 'voice', 'one', 'sort', 'close', 'really', 'SPECIAL', 'FEATURES', '=====*', '10:06-minutes', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Beatles', 'Interview', 'Al', 'Aronowitz', 'rock', 'reporter', 'friend', 'Dylan', 'taking', 'Dylan', 'back', 'meet', 'Beatles', 'back', '60s', 'how', 'Dylan', 'turned', 'pot.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'pulitzer', 'prize', 'winning', 'documentary', 'fun', 'interesting', 'watch']",Paul McCartney Really Is Dead: The Last Testament of George Harrison

Tucker,"[3, 3]","It seems that the makers of this film must have understood that it would be aimed at the more advanced Beatles fan who was familliar with the urban legend surrounding the supposed death of Paul McCartney in the  mid 60's.  However, this film is filled with so much completely erroneos and easily dispelled information that it makes it impossible for even the most casual of fans to suspend disbelief and buy into the premise.  The real shame is in the fact that the core concept of the film, George Harrison fearing that his life is in danger due to the cover up of Paul's death and recording all the details so that they can be revealed postumously if he is killed, is a very interesting one.  Considering that these supposed tapes from George are the centerpiece of the film and it is supposed to be him narrating it from these tapes, they really should have gotten a voice actor who sounded more like George Harrison and less like someone trying to do a parody of him.  The film makers do manage to work in some clever ideas and connections but then they become so sloppy in some of their assertions that you wonder if they did any research before writing this.  For all the far fetched clues to Paul's death that they do trot out, there are other far more obvious and interesting ones that are completely ignored.

But the worst crime of this film is how completely mind-numbing tedious this all is. I bought it thinking it would be an interesting hour and a half of entertainment. How wrong I was. The voice sounds nothing like Harrison, especially in his demeanor and attitude. So they found clues about death and dying and automobile accidents and Paul all through the Beatles songs (played forward and backwards) and album covers. Of course you could find clues about anything you wanted if you're looking for it though, couldn't you? What struck me was that the reality of the Beatles in their last days was that Paul was becoming the more creative as well as producing quality work and John was coasting a bit - in direct opposition to the theory here, which said that John was creating absolutely everything. As well as putting all the clues for us to find.What made this especially painful to watch is that they are taking the slightest bit of Beatles minutiae (the Paul is dead hoax) and focusing entirely on that, while ignoring one of the most interesting times in music history. By creating this fake scenario and giving it credence you take away from a story that needs nothing manufactured to be fascinating. The horrific narration of the supposed George Harrison is beyond ridiculous.This whole thing was a fiction designed at the time to sell magazines to 16 year olds.

White,"[2, 2]","I can get past all the glaring inaccuracies that have been mentioned and the ridiculous first thoughts to alluding to the hoax (i.e. ""Rubber Paul"", ""Taxidermist"")..that we are supposed to believe that people as smart as John and George would be so blatant in their hints led me to treat this as the elaborte hoax/parody that it is. With the cherry on top being the person who narrates this is supposed to be George Harrison but any Beatle fan that has heard George Harrison speak for any length (for example if you've just seen the Anthology...that would be sufficient enough of a reference point) will be able to recognize that the voice is an unconvincing imitation.Coming to this conclusion early on that this ""Focumentary"" (fake documentary) was a joke allowed me to have a good laugh with it.  However the humor turned foul at the end  when  the section entitled ""The Complicity of the Imposter"" surmises that ""Faul"" knew before about the planned attacks on John and George. At this point, the parody turns into a mean-spirited, transparent attempt to paint Paul McCartney in a sinister light and is obviously made by a bunch of Paul haters. It one thing to poke fun of his ""silly love songs"" and his supposed shallowness...that's something that is a common complaint among Paul haters (I for one disagree but I can understand why some people would think that)...it's quite another thing to imply that ""Faul"" is an unfeeling participant in the cover-ups of the attacks on John and George.

These types of films are usually played up for the shock value so I understand that films of this nature will be hammed up to the extreme. This film plays up the conspiracy edge so highly that I almost felt like I would have to be wearing a tin foil helmet to fully buy into what this movie would have you believe.The urban legend of Paul dying & the Beatles replacing him is a fun thing to play around with. Even though it wasn't really real it was still entertaining to look at all the little things that would be put on some of their albums. There's a nice mirthful quality to it that helps draw people in regardless of what they believe.However where this film fails is that they just go overboard. I'll warn you that this is sort of a spoiler but since this stuff can be easily found online I'll go ahead & tell you anyway. Besides, you wouldn't otherwise believe how outlandish the material in this film is.  They see names & words in even the most innocuous of materials & that's just the tame stuff. No, this film would also have you believe that the Beatles traveled to India in order to have the spirit of Paul take over the body of the fake & that MI5 forced them to cover everything up in the first place, threatening with death if they were to spill the beans. It's all done so over the top that the film loses what shock value it could have had. Not to mention that much of the material can easily be debunked, especially when the film references the early songs & albums that were made before Paul supposedly died. Then on top of everything the narrator for this is absolutely terrible. His accent doesn't really sound like George to begin with & said accent also fades in & out throughout the film.If this had been approached in a documentary style & the filmmakers had interspersed the ""proof"" with testimony from fans savvy with the material, historians, & people who worked with or knew Paul, it would have worked far better. The only reason I can see that they didn't do this is because with the way this movie is played up they can claim it's fictional. With a documentary they'd probably be coming more dangerously close to a lawsuit than this film does. Even from a mockumentary standpoint this film fails because it goes so over the top that it even loses what comedic value it would have had.The bottom line is that you should save your money & if you absolutely must watch it, rent it.

1354842,AWIF8AR75LL9L,B003NEVW8E,"Colorgirl ""Spreading color around my world""","[5, 9]","One day I was looking for something unusual to watch and came upon the Paul McCartney Really Is Dead *documentary* so I decided to watch.  At first it is laughable.  I mean this information was based upon a tape that mysteriously showed up at the studio from George Harrison made in his hospital room (if I remember correctly) after being attacked and stabbed in his home to make sure the truth was told about Paul really being dead.At first, the whole thing appears preposterous and stupid, but as the DVD progresses, there are some compelling things in it which do merit closer examination.  Since music fans are only allowed to have information that they are fed by media and other marketers of information, it is fair to say that no one REALLY knows the whole truth about any group and what happened where, except the members themselves and those close to them.This unknown mystery of possibilities is the springboard from which this movie spins a wild yarn about the death and cover up involving the so-called death of Paul using album covers, song lyrics, known events and a convoluted timeline of things that seem to support this notion.I would not have paid much attention except for some people associated with some of the people in this DVD I have spoken to in the past (long time ago) who said some things that did not make sense,  made much more sense after seeing this.  Many things were explained and tied in with my own personal observations over time.Having said that, I will say that the voice in the DVD that claims to be George is worse than the Rutles joke album that came out years ago, and not nearly as good as Klaatu that was another rumor of Beatle production in another past trend of cashing in on Beatle fascination.After reading Tommy James' book and knowing what has happened with others (I know some involved with music industry), this DVD is not totally far-fetched, although it is rather laugh out loud funny at times.  The film is fun to watch and if you don't take it as gospel, it is rather fascinating- at least far more fascinating than the news media that regularly skews and inflates reality to raise income and to keep their audience watching...At best it is a semi-true documentary of things that happened, and at worst, it is great thought out fiction that keeps you wanting to watch until the end.  In either case, if you don't take the Beatles more seriously than they took themselves, this is an enjoyable DVD.Those who have put the Beatles on godlike status and are more serious about them than sports fans are about their favorite teams will not enjoy this movie.  They will be too caught up with trying to prove this DVD a fake and they will miss the entertainment value.",5,I LOVE This DVD!,1311552000,"07 25, 2011",2011,2719,"['One', 'day', 'was', 'looking', 'something', 'unusual', 'watch', 'came', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'Really', 'Dead', '*documentary*', 'decided', 'watch', 'first', 'laughable', 'mean', 'information', 'was', 'based', 'tape', 'mysteriously', 'showed', 'up', 'studio', 'George', 'Harrison', 'made', 'hospital', 'room', 'remember', 'correctly', 'being', 'attacked', 'stabbed', 'home', 'make', 'sure', 'truth', 'was', 'told', 'Paul', 'really', 'being', 'dead.At', 'first', 'whole', 'thing', 'preposterous', 'stupid', 'DVD', 'are', 'compelling', 'things', 'do', 'merit', 'closer', 'examination', 'music', 'fans', 'are', 'only', 'allowed', 'have', 'information', 'are', 'fed', 'media', 'other', 'marketers', 'information', 'fair', 'say', 'one', 'REALLY', 'whole', 'truth', 'group', 'what', 'happened', 'where', 'members', 'close', 'them.This', 'unknown', 'mystery', 'possibilities', 'springboard', 'movie', 'wild', 'yarn', 'death', 'cover', 'up', 'involving', 'so-called', 'death', 'Paul', 'using', 'album', 'covers', 'song', 'lyrics', 'known', 'events', 'convoluted', 'timeline', 'things', 'seem', 'support', 'notion.I', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'paid', 'much', 'attention', 'people', 'associated', 'people', 'DVD', 'have', 'spoken', 'past', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'who', 'said', 'things', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'sense', 'seeing', 'Many', 'things', 'were', 'explained', 'tied', 'own', 'personal', 'observations', 'time.Having', 'said', 'will', 'say', 'voice', 'DVD', 'be', 'George', 'worse', 'Rutles', 'joke', 'album', 'came', 'out', 'years', 'ago', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'Klaatu', 'was', 'rumor', 'Beatle', 'production', 'past', 'trend', 'cashing', 'Beatle', 'fascination.After', 'reading', 'Tommy', 'James', 'book', 'knowing', 'what', 'happened', 'others', 'know', 'involved', 'music', 'industry', 'DVD', 'not', 'totally', 'far-fetched', 'rather', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'funny', 'times', 'film', 'fun', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'gospel', 'rather', 'fascinating-', 'least', 'far', 'more', 'fascinating', 'news', 'media', 'regularly', 'skews', 'reality', 'raise', 'income', 'keep', 'audience', 'watching', 'best', 'semi-true', 'documentary', 'things', 'happened', 'worst', 'great', 'thought', 'out', 'fiction', 'wanting', 'watch', 'end', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'Beatles', 'more', 'seriously', 'took', 'enjoyable', 'DVD.Those', 'who', 'have', 'put', 'Beatles', 'godlike', 'status', 'are', 'more', 'serious', 'sports', 'fans', 'are', 'favorite', 'teams', 'will', 'not', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'caught', 'up', 'trying', 'prove', 'DVD', 'fake', 'will', 'miss', 'entertainment', 'value']",Paul McCartney Really Is Dead: The Last Testament of George Harrison
1354843,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B003NEVW8E,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","The ""Paul is Dead"" story really is one of the better hoaxes of modern times, as evidenced by its longevity (nearly forty-five years and counting).  Like many a Beatles fan, I'm still fascinated by the treasure trove of ""clues"" delivered all those years ago via album covers, song lyrics, and backward masking - so, naturally, I had to see this ""documentary"" as soon as I heard about it (via a talk radio interview with director Joel Gilbert).  Having watched it, I find it somewhat difficult to rate the whole production.  In some respects, Paul McCartney Really Is Dead is quite a piece of work, inundating the viewer with a number of thought-provoking claims reinforced by high production values.  Fans will, of course, immediately see through all of the many problems inherent in the production - but viewers who know little about the Beatles and nothing about the history of the Paul is Dead myth could very well find themselves wondering - once or twice - if Paul McCartney did actually die in a car crash in 1966.  By the end, though, any sense of believability is pretty much gone.  Apart from all its larger problems, this video pushes its own cleverness way too far, yielding claims that are thoroughly ludicrous.Rumors of Paul's death have been around since 1969.  For those unfamiliar with the story, here it is in a nutshell.  Following a row with John during a late-night recording session in late 1966, Paul stormed out of the studio and sped off into the rainy night in his Austin Healey.  Seeing a young woman out in the rain, he stopped and offered her a ride.  When she realized she was in a car with Paul McCartney, she went into hysterics, causing Paul to lose control and crash the car.  The young lady (""Rita"") escaped, but Paul was trapped - and then killed (decapitated, even) when the car exploded.  For various reasons, including concern that untold Beatles fans would commit suicide over the news of Paul's tragic death, Lennon, Harrison, and Star decided to cover up the fact and continue the band with a Paul look-alike.  Feeling guilty about the whole thing, Lennon decided to give fans a bunch of clues to the truth he could not reveal.This documentary is built around a tape recording supposedly made by George Harrison following the home invasion knife attack he suffered at the end of 1999.  In two microcassettes that mysteriously turned up at Highway 61 Entertainment in the summer of 2005, ""Harrison"" relates the whole story - in great detail - of Paul's death and replacement by look-alike William Campbell (whom he refers to as Faul, for False Paul), John's obsession with hiding clues to the truth in later album covers and songs, and the risk involved with the whole operation.  According to the voice on the tape, an MI5 agent named Maxwell swore the three band mates to secrecy, under penalty of death if they ever revealed the truth.  Rita was paid off and given a new identity, William Campbell was brought in and gradually transformed into Paul - via numerous plastic surgeries designed, musical training, speech therapy, etc. - and the band went on to release several more albums, thanks largely to a backlog of song McCartney had written before he died.  ""Harrison"" then goes through all of the clues secretly inserted into their songs and album covers, reveals how he and his mates were threatened and - on one occasion - physically punished by Maxwell and his MI5 goons, describes the fear that overcame then when the Paul is Dead secret got out in 1969, and offers quite an alternative view of post-Beatles history for all concerned.Rather than simply stick with all of the well-known clues, ""Harrison"" drops a number of increasingly ridiculous bombs on the listener.  He claims that John Lennon was murdered less than two weeks after telling him he was going to come out with the truth about Paul McCartney.  He himself was now lying in hospital, recovering from an attempt on his own life by a home invader, after telling ""Faul"" that he had now decided to come clean, as well.  In fact, he says he is recording this ""last will and testament"" as a means of protecting himself from another MI5-sponsored attempt on his life.  He also describes the Beatles' trip to India as an attempt to get help in convincing the dead Paul's spirit to take over the body of ""Faul,"" but even this wild claim can't compare to the revelation regarding Heather Mills - an allegation that, all by itself, makes a mockery of the whole story.Other problems with the tape abound.  First and foremost, the voice doesn't really sound like that of George Harrison.  The recording was supposedly made in hospital, but there is none of the ambient noise you would expect from such an environment.  Then there's the fact that the speaker has perfect diction, never stumbling over a word or pausing to clear his throat - and what a memory he has, easily going into the smallest details of every single clue the Beatles left along the, details that go back well over thirty years.  There are other major goofs, such as a very wrong date for the recording of ""Yesterday.""  It's also pretty amazing that Harrison himself added some of the most obvious of clues to Beatles albums and songs, often during a time he claims to have begged John to stop being so reckless with those very same things.So, yes, the whole documentary is rubbish mired down by wrong facts and ridiculous claims.  That doesn't mean it isn't fascinating or fun to watch, however.  After all, we are talking about one of the most fascinating urban legends of the twentieth century.  As long as you don't take this documentary seriously, Paul McCartney Really is Dead makes for quite an entertaining spectacle.",3,Pure rubbish -- but it's entertaining rubbish,1304726400,"05 7,

1354845,A2EUV5X57341CV,B003NEVW8E,Garry Daniel,"[1, 2]","First off, let me say I believe Paul McCartney, former Wing, Beatle and Quarryman is alive and kicking. Why, may you ask, did I invest time and money in this DVD?Well, the answer really is very simple. Although I never bought into the whole ""Paul is Dead"" thing, I must admit to having a certain fascination with the phenomenon from the beginning. Call it morbid curiosity if you want (and no, I don't slow down to look at car wrecks.)I do remember when my friends and I first heard of this back in 1969 we couldn't wait to look at the album covers and listen more closely to song lyrics to see how anyone could have even started such a rumor. ""Where did they get their information"", we asked. Lo and behold, it was all there. We knew in our hearts that the Beatle bassman was alive but we still couldn't curb our curiosity.We didn't want Paul to be dead, but we did want to continue searching for ""clues"". We came to the conclusion that the Beatles themselves were playing a joke on everyone, and I still feel that way.Having said that, let me say that this DVD could have been better. First of all, anyone who has ever heard George speak would know right away that this person on the tape was doing a very bad George Harrison impersonation. It sounds like the goofy voices used on the old Beatles cartoon show of the 60's. Does anyone remember that ? And then there was the time-line. It's all over the place. Nothing adds up. Rita (aka Heather Mills ) would be,oh, about 105 by now ,as would ""Moxwell"". I cannot imagine the producers saw this as a serious (but seriously flawed) documentary. It has to be a put-on, a lark, a joke, another Rutles. These people seem to know as much about the Beatles as I do about heart surgery. To me, the whole Paul is Dead thing was fun. Simply the Beatles having a laugh, and us too.If you're interested in the phenomenon then by all means, get the DVD.Do it for fun.

James Paul McCartney (the real one) was born in Walton Hospital, Liverpool, on the 18th of June, 1942. Numerically, that makes him a Number 6. However, the sixth song on the album ""Beatles 6,"" ""Words Of Love,"" was in fact composed by Buddy Holly, who died not only on the third of February, 1959, but stipulated in his last testament that all posthumous, universal rights to his publishing catalog be granted in perpetuity to none other than JAMES PAUL McCARTNEY for the nominal fee of... two hundred and fifteen thousand dollars (U.S.)3. When spoken backwards, the title of the 2006 Paul McCartney classical album ""Ecce Cor Meum"" is MUEM ROC ECCE.4. Paul McCartney's first fianc&eacute;e, the actress and cake decorator Jane Asher, recently appeared on British television in the comedy series ""The Old Guys."" Its first season theme song was composed by the Scottish poet/humorist Ivor Cutler who, in 1967, was actually hired by the fake Paul McCartney to portray bus conductor Buster Bloodvessel in the Beatles' ""Magical Mystery Tour."" Buster, in one of the film's most truly disturbing of many such sequences, is seated at a restaurant table alongside Ringo's auntie Jessie as she is being served shovels full of stale, flaccid spaghetti by none other than... JOHN LENNON.5.

Anything that gets normal people that rialed up is, indeed fun.It is a BAD documentary of a hoax. It got hundreds of ""facts"" completely wrong. I will document just a few.For instance, and these may be in other reviews, I did not read them all :It insinuates that John lennon was killed because he decided to go public with the so-called ""fact"" that Paul McCartney was dead. It is a documented historical fact that Mark David Chapman murdered Lennon in front of the Dakota apartments. His ""reasoning"" is also well-documented historically. He did it because John had once talked about the Beatles popularity as opposed to that of Jesus. Chapman came to see John as the AntiChrist and killed him out of a deranged religious conviction. John Lennon was giving interviews just before his death. He had the perfect opportunity to ""spill the beans"" if there had been any real beans to spill. He was NOT killed for deciding to tell the alleged ""truth"" that Paul is dead.The ""George Harrison"" in this film speculates that he was physically attacked for the same reason, but again, the REAL George never gave an interview or even a statement claiming that the real Paul McCartney was dead. There was no reason to silence him. Voice-matching software was not used to determine whether the ""George"" narrating this story was the George Harrison he was claiming to be. The tape, player and packaging were not dusted for the real fingerprints of George Harrison to established he handled them. None of his personal closest friends came forward to say he'd confided in them that Paul McCartney was dead, not even when he was allegedly attacked for having said so and wanting to tell the public. No scientific tests were used to verify the ownership or origin of the tape because the producers of this film knew good and well they were NOT traceable to George Harrison.None of the live ""witnesses"" to the alleged ""Paul is Dead"" events have ever come forward to testify that he had died, they had attended his funeral or that they participated in the cover-up. This conspracy claims to have been known by the Beatles and those around them as well as doctors, teachers and many others. Grand conspiracies always break down when too many people know the real truth or know it for too long.It documents that Paul's mother was at his ""funeral"" in 1966, but of course ""On 31 October 1956, Mary McCartney died of an embolism after a mastectomy operation to stop the spread of her breast cancer."" (this quote is from wikipedia)So, why do I find ANY fun in this film at all? Well it's like the film ""The Attack of the Killer Tomatoes."" It is a poorly-produced film based on something that could never, ever happen. If you watched it to see if tomatoes could really kill people, you probably thought it was one of the worst films ever. On the other hand, if you dispended your disbelief for a couple of hours and PRETENDED that tomatoes were on a murderous rampage and did, indeed kill people, it was a fantastic film. I LOVE ""The Attack of the Killer Tomatoes,"" and have never, to this day, eaten a BLT.This ""Paul is Dead"" film was fun for me when I PRETENDED that it was documented history. The hoax was a very fun PRETEND conspiracy. I enjoyed imagining that a look-alike contest-winner with no known previous talent or noteriaty was brought in to complete the Beatles and was able to fool everyone. It's a FUN storyline for cheap and dirty FICTION.The movie producers MUST know it is a fantasy.

Why would he recount the history of the Beatles before getting to the meat of his message?  The simple fact is that he wouldn't.  The story behind Paul's fictitious death is ludicrously elaborate, and the reason for its being kept secret is not plausible.  For this film to be credible, one would have to accept that every single decision the Beatles made on every album was carefully calculated to relate to Paul's death.  In fact, many of the clues have to be so stretched to fit the narrative that they expose the creators' ineptitude at even creating a convincing hoax.

1354865,A3KZ8RF0NIJ6JF,B003NEVW8E,"O ""fro493""","[47, 64]","What remarkable research went into the production of this documentary! I mean, how can anyone doubt after seeing this that Paul isn't dead? Impossible. The voice is eerily George Harrison's, no doubt. One minor mistake though. It was actually recorded in 2002, one day before the release of his posthumous album, ""Brainwashed."" WHOA! WAIT! George Harrison recorded new music after he died!? They need to make a film about that one too! They can call it, ""George is Dead, And Still Making Music."" (I got copyright on it!)Okay, so here's the facts:1. Paul died in a car crash in 1966. They got a perfect look-alike who happened to be more talented than the original Paul BECAUSE everyone, almost, agrees that The Beatles got better with Sgt. Pepper's and onward, so if the original Paul had lived, they'd still be singing ""she loves you yeah yeah yeah"" - the new and improved Paul is the real genius, and that's why John got so jealous, so he hooked up with Yoko just to irritate the new and more talented Paul. He started throwing in those lyrics when you play it backwards it says ""Sorry guys, Paul is dead' or ""I buried Paul"" or ""Paul died in 1966 and the new Paul is a blue meanie"" -- oh did you miss that last one?? Well, if you play ""Revolution 1"" backwards for 3 seconds, then forwards for 5 seconds, you hear it clearly!2.The new and improved Paul went on to have a marvelous solo career, and that's why John didn't talk to him any more. John knew if the the original Paul had lived, then there's no way on earth he would've been as popular as the new Paul, there never would've been Wings, no ""Band On The Run,"" and no massive sell-out world tours going on strong STILL! Nope. It would've been the mediocre old Paul singing ""she loves you yeah yeah yeah"" till maybe 1975 at best, then fading into the sunset of 1976 as a glorified has-been.3. The ""Abbey Road"" album cover. I mean, come on, of course they dressed like that to tell the world Paul is Dead. Why else would they wear those clothes? I mean, it couldn't be that they MEANT THAT THE BEATLES AS A GROUP WERE ON THEIR WAY TO THEIR OWN FUNERAL, BEING THEY KNEW AHEAD OF TIME IT WAS THEIR LAST ALBUM TOGETHER?? NAHHHH SCRATCH THAT! It was the new Paul walking barefoot with the cigarette in hand, the walking dead, his conscience was eating at him, he wanted subconsciously to get caught, the secret to be revealed - the truth was killing him inside! And when the truth came out in 1969, thanks to the Abbey Road clues plus the backward messages in previous songs... well, not enough people believed it, no one could accept the old Paul was dead. So new Paul thought to himself, 'Oh well, I tried to tell them, but they just wouldn't believe it.' So his conscience was at ease, and he could go on to have a stellar solo career, continuing four decades strong and still going!Now you know the real story. I hope I didn't spoil the movie for you.

We really are not sure if this was supposed to be a real documentary or a mockumentary but that seems unlikely because it was not one bit intentionally funny. So if it was real it was beyond b and therefore phenomenal but if it was a mockumentary it was awful. Sid decided to look on the b side of things(does it hurt baby?) and viewed this as the first Sid b documentary. Yeah the first. Sid is going to branch a little into some b docs. What u know bout that?A little background on the story: In 1969 a rumor circulated that 3 years earlier Paul McCartney died in a car accident and was replaced by a lookalike in 1966. So this filmmaker supposedly receives a mysterious package from England! It was a tape recorder with George Harrison's final testament on it. And George tells the story of what happened to Paul and how it was covered up. The guy who did the voice that was supposed to be George was great, not as great as Jim Morrison inWayne's World 2but what can you do? If Harrison had that voice The Beatles would've played the Liverpool equivalent of Jenks forever. But he provided the famous ""Moxwell called us a bluudy bunch of coontz"" scene so he's got a lifetime pass from Sid. They go through the whole thing with the lyrics to Come Together and Revolution 9 played backwards says ""turn me on dead man"" kind of. And about 20 minutes is spent on the Sgt. Pepper cover. And if you're a Beatles nerd well I'm not really used to that but that's fine but there were lots of factual errors. The worst one was that the film said that Help held clues of Paul's death and the rest of the group's grief. Help was released in 65 and Paul supposedly died in 1966.Overall this was an enjoyable B experience. If the budget is less than $100 Sid Bros., Inc. will always be down with it and this one fit. But Paul McCartney is not dead George Harrison didn't pour his soul out and mail it to some b documentary maker working out of an Econo Lodge room. It added to the B but also the confusion.

1354870,A10C5CJK1YKGV0,B003NEVW8E,Steffan Piper,"[3, 7]","Wow. After having just watched this in its entirety, I'm not just left speechless, but also a tad giggly. The problem with this documentary style, independent movie, is that the main premise that it tries very hard to sell is just poorly preformed.The premise is that some random, non-essential production company (with a fake CG Logo on their building, ahem) in Los Angeles (of all places) receives an anonymous package in the mail containing a mini-cassette player and some tapes made by now-deceased Beatle, George Harrison (gasp!), and supposedly recorded while he was in hospital after being stabbed by the much publicized intruder in 1999. These tapes, made approximately a year before his death (of lung cancer which had spread throughout his body and brain) reveal a vigourous, non-laboured sounding Harrison recounting his life in a 'documentary styled' and much rehearsed manner. His tonality in this made him a shoe-in replacement for Art Bell or any other late-night talk-show radio host. Who knew he had it in him, lol?The real problem is that, having grown up in England myself, and have been living in America for some time, I've heard ever manner of fake British / Irish / Welsh / Scottish accent under the sun and many imitations through the years of every Beatle band member. While this person narrating tries hard, it's just far too obvious based upon inflection, word pronunciation, a lack of consistency with several different words that you just find yourself asking how someone could take themselves so serious and believe for even a minute that this would be passable. The voice-over is also remastered in stereo, just in case you were wondering.If George Harrison would've decided to sit down and narrate some devious plot regarding the Beatles, it likely would've sounded much different as the story he weaves is sophomoric on its face and not the most cogent. A nefarious plot revolving around some unnamed MI5 agent code-named 'Maxwell' (Allo, silva hamma, then darlings?) weaves through the entire story and even leaves a shadowy hand on the death of John Lennon. Gasp! Sigh.In too many places, this movie tries way too hard when it really doesn't have to. The reports that were made and the facts regarding the Fake Paul or Faul, as he's constantly referenced in the movie, should just be covered as-is. Yes, there was REAL hysteria about Paul McCartney's supposed 'untimely death' that started in the late 60's. Okay, so just sell us that.Even though the Fake Paul / Faul is unmasked in this as the Scottish William Campbell, who won a look-a-like contest, the so-called George Harrison doesn't really give much detail about Faul past ""John thought it would be a good idea to have a stand-in for awhile."" Add in a bit about plastic surgery and ... boom ... moving on. Really? Oh, yeah ... MI5!So, after an automobile accident one dark and stormy night / early morning, November 9th 1966, Paul leaves the recording studio angry after having an argument with John (in earlier newspaper reports through the years however, he had this so-called argument with Ringo; just sayin') and then crashes his white Austin Healey after picking up a girl named Rita who was walking in the rain. Yep. ""Took her home, nearly made it."" Oh yes, prepare yourself for lyric analysis to which you haven't seen the depths of before, photographic evidence, historical record and endless back-masking. The whole detailed plot of slow-leaking led by Lennon himself.If I was Paul McCartney -- and not Faul McCartney, or any one of his many children, I'd likely be upset about all this and want to have a conversation about those so-called tapes. But if it's fraudulent, then why would he even bother? Who knows? Remember when Neil Armstrong punched that reporter in the face for suggesting the Moon landing was a fake? Yeah, it would likely go like that. Better to avoid that lawsuit, haha.I gave this movie 4 stars because, honestly, if you're a Beatle fan and you're curious, then you should watch this as it is good entertainment and even while it's a bit contrived and less convincing than previous efforts (and there have been others) this is something to see and have a good chuckle at. So many other movies ask us to suspend our belief from tap-dancing, talking penguins to some surfer guy caught in the Matrix.

1354873,A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW,B003NEVW8E,The Peripatetic Reader,"[3, 7]","After a cursory viewing of the film, after reading these reviews, and while I believe the ""Paul is Dead"" story is a hoax, I believe ""Is Paul Dead"" will always be an unanswered question. I agree with one reviewer that the chance of finding a look alike, even after plastic surgery, credibly passing for Paul McCartney is astronomical. I do not totally agree with another reviewer that Paul composed his greatest work after the supposed accident. Maybe during the Sixties and Early Seventies. But if you've heard his musical output for the last twenty five years the question ""Is Paul dead?"" takes on an entirely new meaning. Is he dead? Well, the quality of his recent music output certainly is. However, I agree with the consensus of most of the reviewers that the ""voice"" of George Harrison is a complete fabrication and an insult to everyone's intelligence. For anyone familiar with George Harrison's voice it is immediately that it is a rank imitation.The fact that there would be such a hoax at all is consistent with Paul's personality, who always shamelessly wanted to be the center of attention.Still, I recall at the time Life magazine ran a story on the ""Paul is dead"" hoax and showed voice graphs of Paul's voice both before and after the supposed accident. There was a noticeable difference in the voice graphs. Also, if you look very closely and compare photographs of the very young Paul McCartney when the Beatles first started being famous with his photographs from the Let it Be sessions time period, there are also some noticeable facial differences around his brow, eybrows, and cheekbones which I believe cannot be accounted for by the aging process. The supposed time period of this car accident would also account for the internal changes which occurred in the band. After all, it was after 1966, the year of the accident, that Paul actively attempted to take a leadership role in the Beatles, a power struggled which definitely contributed to the break-up of the band.I think that the Beatles' estates have not sued over this DVD because the ""Paul is Dead"" hoax has become so much a part of a urban myth, and the DVD is such a shoddy production anyway, that they have decided to not waste their money for the attorneys fees needed to take this thing off the market; it would be beneath their dignity to wage a fight over this. I am not aware of any remaining member of the Beatles or of their estates making a statement on this DVD. The DVD is obvously for entertainment value only and is not intended, I believe, by even the producers, to be presented as historical fact.So while I believe the person is alive, and that if anything died it was his music, for me there will always be that question whether there was any truth to the rumors that Paul really died in that car accident.",1,It wil be always an unanswered question,1293840000,"01 1, 2011",2011,2805,"['cursory', 'viewing', 'film', 'reading', 'reviews', 'believe', 'Paul', 'Dead', 'story', 'hoax', 'believe', 'Paul', 'Dead', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'unanswered', 'question', 'agree', 'one', 'reviewer', 'chance', 'finding', 'look', 'alike', 'even', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'credibly', 'passing', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'astronomical', 'do', 'not', 'totally', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'Paul', 'composed', 'greatest', 'work', 'supposed', 'accident', 'Maybe', 'Sixties', 'Early', 'Seventies', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'musical', 'output', 'last', 'twenty', 'five', 'years', 'question', 'Paul', 'dead', 'entirely', 'new', 'meaning', 'dead', 'Well', 'quality', 'recent', 'music', 'output', 'certainly', 'However', 'agree', 'consensus', 'most', 'reviewers', 'voice', 'George', 'Harrison', 'complete', 'fabrication', 'insult', 'everyone', 'intelligence', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'George', 'Harrison', 'voice', 'immediately', 'rank', 'imitation.The', 'fact', 'would', 'be', 'such', 'hoax', 'consistent', 'Paul', 'personality', 'who', 'always', 'shamelessly', 'wanted', 'be', 'center', 'attention.Still', 'recall', 'time', 'Life', 'magazine', 'ran', 'story', 'Paul', 'dead', 'hoax', 'showed', 'voice', 'graphs', 'Paul', 'voice', 'supposed', 'accident', 'was', 'noticeable', 'difference', 'voice', 'graphs', 'Also', 'look', 'very', 'closely', 'compare', 'photographs', 'very', 'young', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'when', 'Beatles', 'first', 'started', 'being', 'famous', 'photographs', 'Let', 'Be', 'sessions', 'time', 'period', 'are', 'also', 'noticeable', 'facial', 'differences', 'brow', 'cheekbones', 'believe', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'accounted', 'aging', 'process', 'supposed', 'time', 'period', 'car', 'accident', 'would', 'also', 'account', 'internal', 'changes', 'occurred', 'band', 'was', '1966', 'year', 'accident', 'Paul', 'actively', 'attempted', 'take', 'leadership', 'role', 'Beatles', 'power', 'struggled', 'definitely', 'contributed', 'break-up', 'band.I', 'think', 'Beatles', 'estates', 'have', 'not', 'sued', 'DVD', 'Paul', 'Dead', 'hoax', 'become', 'so', 'much', 'part', 'urban', 'myth', 'DVD', 'such', 'shoddy', 'production', 'anyway', 'have', 'decided', 'not', 'waste', 'money', 'attorneys', 'fees', 'needed', 'take', 'thing', 'off', 'market', 'would', 'be', 'beneath', 'dignity', 'wage', 'fight', 'am', 'not', 'aware', 'remaining', 'member', 'Beatles', 'estates', 'making', 'statement', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'obvously', 'entertainment', 'value', 'only', 'not', 'intended', 'believe', 'even', 'producers', 'be', 'presented', 'historical', 'fact.So', 'believe', 'person', 'alive', 'anything', 'died', 'was', 'music', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'question', 'was', 'truth', 'rumors', 'Paul', 'really', 'died', 'car', 'accident']",Paul McCartney Really Is Dead: The Last Testament of George Harrison
