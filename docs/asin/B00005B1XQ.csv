579816,A3GTK03C19V47W,B00005B1XQ,"James Bowen ""historian""","[0, 0]","This Discovery Channel account of the Battle of Midway largely focusses on the battle and deals only superficially with the strategic context in which the most important battle of the Pacific War took place. The battle coverage is excellent and much of it is in colour. This documentary also includes excellent computer graphics and interviews with men who flew the American warplanes at Midway, including the famous Lieutenant Commander Richard Halsey Best who participated in the sinking of two Japanese carriers at Midway - the Japanese flagship Akagi and the Hiryu.The producers have done an excellent job of examining and explaining the course of an historic and very complex naval battle; but the documentary fails to explain adequately the reasons for the defeat that turned the tide against the previously victorious Japanese Navy.The producers mention that the carrier-launched Doolittle Raid on Japan on 18 April 1942 did more than boost American morale. Although the damage to Japan was slight, the Doolittle Raid stunned Japan and the Japanese high command. The admirals of Japan's Imperial Navy had assured Emperor Hirohito that Japan's home islands would never be touched by American retaliation for Pearl Harbor. The red-faced admirals had failed to keep that pledge to their emperor. Japan's Navy General Staff and the Army General Staff had previously not supported Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's plan to destroy the carriers of the US Pacific Fleet at far distant Midway Atoll in the central Pacific. The Japanese high command suspected that Yamamoto intended his Midway operation to be the first step in an ambitious operation to capture Hawaii. These suspicions were well founded. The Japanese Imperial Navy had long planned for the decisive conflict between the Japanese and American navies to take place close to Japanese occupied territory so that land-based bombers could support the Japanese fleet. After the Doolittle Raid, the Japanese high command threw its weight fully behind Yamamoto's plan and gave it top priority.The decision to support Yamamoto's Midway operation threw Japan's Pacific strategy completely off balance. Prior to Doolittle, Japan's highest priority in the Pacific had been to secure Australia's isolation and surrender by blockade and bombing. Now that priority would be shared with an all out effort to destroy the carriers of the US Pacific Fleet at Midway. Although giving their backing to Yamamoto's Midway operation, Navy General Staff was not prepared to defer action to isolate Australia from the United States. Navy General Staff saddled Yamamoto's Combined Fleet with three major naval operations to be set in train simultaneously: (1) the capture of Australia's Port Moresby; (2) the Midway operation to destroy the US Pacific Fleet carriers; and (3) capture of islands in the Alaskan Aleutian chain. This documentary mistakenly suggests that the Aleutian operation was part of Yamamoto's initial planning for his Midway operation as a diversion to distract American attention from Midway. In fact, the Alaskan operation originated from Navy General Staff, and it was intended to prevent the United States obtaining access to Russian bases from which American heavy bombers could strike Japan. Although the Alaskan operation was not his own plan, Yamamoto accepted it as being a useful diversion of attention from Midway.The strategic importance of the Doolittle Raid lies in the fact that it caused the Japanese to set in train simultaneously three widely separated major naval offensives, and breach the fundamental military principle of concentrating force to win battles.This documentary does not acknowledge three critical blunders by the Japanese: (1) the Japanese Midway/Alaska plan was overly complex; (2) the Japanese assumed that the Americans would respond to the simultaneous Japanese offensives at Midway and Alaska as the Japanese wanted them to respond; and (3) the dispersal of the massive Japanese naval armada into five separate formations scattered over thousands of miles of ocean denied any one formation support from another formation when it ran into difficulty as happened to Japan's First Carrier Striking Force on 4 June 1942.The documentary mentions the Coral Sea and the damage to the fleet carrier USS Yorktown that had to be repaired quickly to enable Yorktown to participate in the Battle of Midway; but its fails to mention that Coral Sea almost certainly played an important role in the Japanese defeat at Midway. Admiral Yamamoto had intended to attack Midway Atoll and the US Pacific Fleet with the same six powerful fleet carriers that attacked Pearl Harbor. He foolishly allowed the fleet carriers Shokaku and Zuikaku to be diverted in early May 1942 to cover the capture of Port Moresby. The timing of the Port Moresby operation was not crucial, and it should have been postponed to a date after the Midway operation in June 1942. This blunder cost the Japanese dearly. Bomb damage and aircraft losses suffered at Coral Sea deprived Admiral Yamamoto of Shokaku and Zuikaku for his attack on Midway Atoll which had to be undertaken with only four fleet carriers, and consequently, the margin of superiority over the American carriers at Midway (three) was significantly reduced by Coral Sea.The documentary pursues a factually incorrect view that the flight decks of the four Japanese carriers were packed with bombers preparing to attack the American carriers when American SBD dive-bombers struck and destroyed the fleet carriers Akagi, Kaga, and Soryu. In fact, the flight decks of all four Japanese carriers had been cleared for the combat air patrol Zeros to land, refuel, rearm, and relaunch to combat low level American torpedo bomber attacks. There were no bombers on the decks of the three carriers when they received fatal American bomb strikes. The false picture of activity on the Japanese carrier flight decks appears to have arisen from an account of the battle by Commander Mitsuo Fuchida who appears to have been motivated by a desire to avoid an appearance that the Japanese carrier fleet had been thrown completely off balance by repeated American air attacks, as indeed it had been. See Fuchida and Okumiya:Midway: The Battle That Doomed Japan. Fuchida's claim that the Japanese carrier flight decks were packed with bombers is not supported by the official Japanese history of the Pacific War Senshi Sosho. Even if Fuchida had given a true account of activity on the Japanese flight decks it would not have altered the outcome of the American dive-bomber attacks. The Japanese flight decks contained Zeros fighters and open fuel lines. Bombs and torpedoes were littered about and had not been returned to the carrier's magazines. The Japanese carriers still resembled highly combustible powder kegs.I recommend this documentary to those who are primarily interested in an excellent and very clear coverage of the battle itself.",4,An excellent account of the battle but not its historical context,1356739200,"12 29, 2012",2012,6940,"['Discovery', 'Channel', 'account', 'Battle', 'Midway', 'largely', 'battle', 'deals',

But the footage was used. It is raw. No special effects here. It is the real deal. In some cases, the explosions were so near and so violent, the film in the camera comes off the reel and the images become jittery and distorted. In other cases it appears the cameraman is knocked unconscious and the camera just dangles around from their neck over a bomb crater. John Ford has done an amazing job of putting this footage together with a sound track that at times reflects the action on the screen and at other times leads the viewer to the next scene.
