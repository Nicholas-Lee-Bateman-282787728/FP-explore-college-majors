1129856,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B00114XTHA,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[14, 16]","There are many things that happen in `Things We Lost in the Fire;' so many that it has an immediate impact that keeps a flow through the whole film.  While most of the movie contains dialogue that makes the movie move so slowly, it saves itself from becoming a trivial soap opera by making every movement deliberate and absorbing.Brian (David Duchovny) and Audrey (Halle Berry) Burke start the deliberations as a loving, mixed racial couple. He's a successful businessman, and they have two lively and likable children, Harper (10) and Dory (6), who look up to dad, even though he's a bit rough when teaching the timid Dori how to swim.  Not a perfect family, but love and prosperity pervade their home.  Instantly, we make a connection when Brian tells Dory she is like a fluroscent light, glowing from within.Creating friction is Brian's best friend from childhood, Jerry Sunborne (Benedicio Del Toro) who is a heroin addict on the mend and attending Narcotics Anonymous Meetings.  In contrast to Brian's well-furnished dwelling, Jerry lives in an apartment that looks like the living space of a cheap motel room.  He finds different ways to be on the mend, but as The Velvet Underground's ""Sweet Jane"" reverberates through his headphones, we start to get an idea of the draw.  (And those well-edited time frames that nervously jump to the near future give one a close observation of the mending consciousness of an addict.)  Audrey resents how much time and effort Brian puts into their relationship and notes that he is the giver and Jerry is the benefactor with little room for give and take.Then during a self-less act I won't go into here, Brian loses his life.  Both friend and wife are shell-shocked, beyond belief, and Audrey must pick up the pieces as she tends to her emotional ship-wrecked life with two children to bring up by herself.True to heart, both Audrey and Jerry try to fill the void in their lives.  She looks at him in a new light, but as they get closer together, his knowledge of Brian creates some friction as she realizes he had some missing pieces of her late husband she never had when he was alive.  Both characters have setbacks and breakthroughs that reveal a lot of truth emotionally about how much heartbreak can effect people in their daily lives.Audrey finds herself fixing up the garage where a fire destroyed many of their stored possessions, and it is here that Jerry is given a chance to help the family and find an inviting place to stay.  The children are taken by him, but Audrey again finds some resentment that resurfaces during his stay.  Objectively, Audrey's brother, Neal (Omar Benson Miller), and Brian's closest work associate, Howard (John Carroll Lynch, 'Memento'), are able to bridge some objective realizations in both parties' lives.  Further, fellow NA member, Kelly (Allison Lohman) provides some badly needed support for Jerry.Whatever complaints of plodding development, 'Things We Lost in the Fire' answers quickly by creating an emotional appeal that works early and often throughout the film.",4,"""What's Important in This Life...""",1205020800,"03 9, 2008",2008,3057,"['are', 'many', 'things', 'happen', 'Things', 'Lost', 'Fire', 'so', 'many', 'immediate', 'impact', 'flow', 'whole', 'film', 'most', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'move', 'so', 'slowly', 'becoming', 'trivial', 'soap', 'opera', 'making', 'movement', 'deliberate', 'absorbing.Brian', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'Audrey', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Burke', 'start', 'deliberations', 'loving', 'mixed', 'racial', 'couple', 'successful', 'businessman', 'have', 'two', 'lively', 'likable', 'children', 'Harper', '10', 'Dory', '6', 'who', 'look', 'up', 'dad', 'even', 'bit', 'rough', 'when', 'teaching', 'timid', 'Dori', 'how', 'swim', 'Not', 'perfect', 'family', 'love', 'prosperity', 'pervade', 'home', 'Instantly', 'make', 'connection', 'when', 'Brian', 'Dory', 'fluroscent', 'light', 'glowing', 'within.Creating', 'friction', 'Brian', 'best', 'friend', 'childhood', 'Jerry', 'Sunborne', 'Benedicio', 'Del', 'Toro', 'who', 'heroin', 'addict', 'mend', 'attending', 'Narcotics', 'Anonymous', 'Meetings', 'contrast', 'Brian', 'well-furnished', 'dwelling', 'Jerry', 'apartment', 'living', 'space', 'cheap', 'motel', 'room', 'different', 'ways', 'be', 'mend', 'Velvet', 'Underground', 'Sweet', 'Jane', 'headphones', 'start', 'get', 'idea', 'draw', 'well-edited', 'time', 'frames', 'nervously', 'near', 'future', 'give', 'one', 'close', 'observation', 'mending', 'consciousness', 'addict', 'Audrey', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'effort', 'Brian', 'relationship', 'notes', 'giver', 'Jerry', 'benefactor', 'little', 'room', 'give', 'take.Then', 'self-less', 'act', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'here', 'Brian', 'life', 'friend', 'wife', 'are', 'shell-shocked', 'belief', 'Audrey', 'must', 'pick', 'up', 'pieces', 'emotional', 'ship-wrecked', 'life', 'two', 'children', 'bring', 'up', 'herself.True', 'heart', 'Audrey', 'Jerry', 'try', 'fill', 'void', 'lives', 'new', 'light', 'get', 'closer', 'together', 'knowledge', 'Brian', 'friction', 'had', 'missing', 'pieces', 'late', 'husband', 'never', 'had', 'when', 'was', 'alive', 'characters', 'have', 'setbacks', 'breakthroughs', 'reveal', 'lot', 'truth', 'emotionally', 'how', 'much', 'heartbreak', 'can', 'effect', 'people', 'daily', 'lives.Audrey', 'fixing', 'up', 'garage', 'where', 'fire', 'destroyed', 'many', 'stored', 'possessions', 'here', 'Jerry', 'given', 'chance', 'help', 'family', 'find', 'inviting', 'place', 'stay', 'children', 'are', 'taken', 'Audrey', 'again', 'resentment', 'stay', 'Objectively', 'Audrey', 'brother', 'Neal', 'Omar', 'Benson', 'Miller', 'Brian', 'closest', 'work', 'associate', 'Howard', 'John', 'Carroll', 'Lynch', ""'Memento"", 'are', 'able', 'bridge', 'objective', 'realizations', 'parties', 'lives', 'Further', 'fellow', 'NA', 'member', 'Kelly', 'Allison', 'Lohman', 'badly', 'needed', 'support', 'Jerry.Whatever', 'complaints', 'plodding', 'development', 'Lost', 'Fire', 'answers', 'quickly', 'creating', 'emotional', 'appeal', 'early', 'often', 'film']",N/A
1129857,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B00114XTHA,Alistair McHarg,"[2, 7]","It's hard to begin with Halle Berry and Benicio Del Toro only to end with a bloated Dockers commercial; but Danish director Susanne Bier has managed this reverse alchemy convincingly.  Things We Lost In The Fire is so torpid, gaseous, brooding, and atmospheric that at times it actually seems to be moving in reverse.  The style is reminiscent of Catch and Release, another horrible movie where attractive settings and people, pleasant music, pointless extreme close-ups, and mood are intended to replace plot, characterization, insight, development, and content.  Had you told me that ""writer"" Allan Loeb had been lost in the fire and Ms. Bier began shooting with no script at all - I would not have been surprised.Instead of one bad plot, TWLITF unsuccessfully kluges together two bad plots.  Brian Burke, (David Duchovny), has died.  Wife Audrey, (Halle Berry) and her children, daughter Harper (Alexis Llewellyn) and son Dory (Micah Berry) must deal with the loss.  So it's a movie about loss and grief, right?  No.  Brian's best friend is Jerry (Benicio Del Toro) and he is a skid row heroin addict.  So it's a movie about addiction, right?  No.  It's a movie that's about neither because what this movie is really about is close up shots of Halle Berry's eyes accompanied by soothing guitar music.  You will recognize this visual vocabulary from cosmetics commercials.Halle Berry's beauty causes people to marginalize her acting ability - but she was stunning in Monster's Ball.  Berry is the real thing, and she is wonderful in this movie.  Benicio Del Toro has incredible on screen presence, he is soulful and powerful, and he too is terrific in TWLITF.  (Duchovny has as much emotional range as a bowl of oatmeal and looks like he was drawn by a talentless third-grader.)  John Carroll Lynch, much loved as Marge's husband in Fargo, delivers a splendid supporting performance.  Little Alexis Llewellyn practically walks away with the entire show, she is not only beautiful, as Harper she is self-possessed far beyond what one would ever expect from a child actor.  Even Alison Lohman, as Jerry's NA buddy, brings authority to TWLITF.  All squandered.TWLITF is beautiful to look at and contains good performances.  It means well, and has its heart in the right place.  That's nice.  Had an actual writer and director been involved, these would have been essential components of something larger, (historically referred to as a story), a narrative structure enabling interesting interaction between well-drawn characters.

1129860,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00114XTHA,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Susanne Bier's 2004 masterpiece `Brodre' was far and away one of the best films I've seen this decade.  Having seen that recently again I decided that, despite my preconceived notions of her English film `Things we Lost in the Fire' (mainly that I find Berry rather uneven as an actress and doubted her ability to sell the film), I really wanted to see it.So I did, this past Saturday.While I have some reservations about the plot in general, I have to admit that this film was very moving and at times very, very sincere.  The acting is nearly flawless on all accounts, which is not shocking when looking at Del Toro (who is one of the finest actors working today) but it is rather shocking when looking at Berry.  She blew me away here with her ability to just sink into her role without the seemingly forced spasms of uncontrollable grief she exhibited in her Oscar winning performance in `Monster's Ball'.The film begins with a tragedy, as Audrey Burke loses her husband in a horrific crime.  Left to handle the raising of her two children alone, not to mention picking up the pieces of her shattered existence, Audrey is moved to offer her husband's best friend (and recovering drug addict) Jerry a place to stay.  She needs to help around the house but mostly she needs someone there, to talk to and to feel connected to.  As much as she at one point despised him, the reality is that he is the closest connection she has to her late husband.  As time goes by their bond grows, and her children begin to move on as Jerry takes the place of their father.  While this is a good thing, it also lays another burden on Audrey as she witnesses her husband being replaced; his memory slowly fading from their lives.I'll just blurt this out right here; the film has its fare share of clich&eacute;d plot points.  It follows that general formula of `things have to go great then get really bad before they can reach the happy ending' and I really was hoping for a different structure to this film, especially since the film opened so strong.  I also thought that the way the script handled Jerry's addiction was rather `by the books' (you can smell that relapse coming from a mile away, but honestly, I don't think he ever stopped using), but Del Toro elevates that character so much it doesn't really matter in the end.Yes, the acting makes this film a definite MUST-SEE.  Halle Berry and Benicio Del Toro are practically flawless here, both of them completely understanding how to play to their strengths and deliver a subtle, moving and realistic portrait of two lives spun out of control by the demise of a mutual friend.  Moreso than that, Brian (Audrey's husband) was their rock.  He was the only person still standing strong beside Jerry, and he was Audrey's world and her only comfort.  Together, Jerry and Audrey find the strength to move past this terrible moment in their lives.  Alexis Llewellyn is also marvelous as Audrey's daughter Harper, and John Carroll Lynch has some soft and sincere moments as their neighbor Howard.This is a very good film with some very memorable performances.  Sure, it could have been stronger, had the script been a little less conventional and a little more `un-Hollywood' (I mean, `Brodre' was as `un-Hollywood' as they come, so I was really looking forward to that same process here) but the acting is a saving grace, and Bier's delicate direction makes this film poignant and moving.",4,"Soft, delicate and very moving despite its clich&eacute;d construction...",1238976000,"04 6, 2009",2009,3427,"['Susanne', 'Bier', '2004', 'masterpiece', 'Brodre', 'was', 'far', 'away', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'decade', 'Having', 'seen', 'recently', 'again', 'decided', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'English', 'film', 'Lost', 'Fire', 'mainly', 'find', 'Berry', 'rather', 'uneven', 'actress', 'doubted', 'ability', 'sell', 'film', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'it.So', 'did', 'past', 'Saturday.While', 'have', 'reservations', 'plot', 'general', 'have', 'admit', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'moving', 'times', 'very', 'very', 'sincere', 'acting', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'accounts', 'not', 'shocking', 'when', 'looking', 'Del', 'Toro', 'who', 'one', 'finest', 'actors', 'working', 'today', 'rather', 'shocking', 'when', 'looking', 'Berry', 'blew', 'away', 'here', 'ability', 'just', 'sink', 'role', 'seemingly', 'forced', 'spasms', 'uncontrollable', 'grief', 'exhibited', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'performance', 'Monster', ""Ball'.The"", 'film', 'tragedy', 'Audrey', 'Burke', 'husband', 'horrific', 'crime', 'Left', 'handle', 'raising', 'two', 'children', 'alone', 'not', 'mention', 'picking', 'up', 'pieces', 'shattered', 'existence', 'Audrey', 'moved', 'offer', 'husband', 'best', 'friend', 'recovering', 'drug', 'addict', 'Jerry', 'place', 'stay', 'help', 'house', 'mostly', 'someone', 'there', 'talk', 'feel', 'connected', 'As', 'much', 'one', 'point', 'despised', 'reality', 'closest', 'connection', 'late', 'husband', 'time', 'bond', 'grows', 'children', 'begin', 'move', 'Jerry', 'place', 'father', 'good', 'thing', 'also', 'burden', 'Audrey', 'husband', 'being', 'replaced', 'memory', 'slowly', 'fading', 'lives.I', ""'ll"", 'just', 'blurt', 'out', 'right', 'here', 'film', 'fare', 'share', 'clich', 'eacute', 'plot', 'points', 'general', 'formula', 'things', 'have', 'go', 'great', 'then', 'get', 'really', 'bad', 'can', 'reach', 'happy', 'ending', 'really', 'was', 'hoping', 'different', 'structure', 'film', 'especially', 'film', 'opened', 'so', 'strong', 'also', 'thought', 'way', 'script', 'handled', 'Jerry', 'addiction', 'was', 'rather', 'books', 'can', 'smell', 'relapse', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'stopped', 'using', 'Del', 'Toro', 'character', 'so', 'much', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'end.Yes', 'acting', 'film', 'definite', 'MUST-SEE', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Benicio', 'Del', 'Toro', 'are', 'practically', 'flawless', 'here', 'completely', 'understanding', 'how', 'play', 'strengths', 'deliver', 'subtle', 'moving', 'realistic', 'portrait', 'two', 'lives', 'spun', 'control', 'demise', 'mutual', 'friend', 'Moreso', 'Brian', 'Audrey', 'husband', 'was', 'rock', 'was', 'only', 'person', 'still', 'standing', 'strong', 'beside', 'Jerry', 'was', 'Audrey', 'world', 'only', 'comfort', 'Together', 'Jerry', 'Audrey', 'find', 'strength', 'move', 'terrible', 'moment', 'lives', 'Alexis', 'Llewellyn', 'also', 'marvelous', 'Audrey', 'daughter', 'Harper', 'John', 'Carroll', 'Lynch', 'soft', 'sincere', 'moments', 'neighbor', 'Howard.This', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'very', 'memorable', 'performances', 'Sure', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stronger', 'had', 'script', 'been', 'little', 'less', 'conventional', 'little', 'more', 'un-Hollywood', 'mean', 'Brodre', 'was', 'un-Hollywood', 'come', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'same', 'process', 'here', 'acting', 'saving', 'grace', 'Bier', 'delicate', 'direction', 'film', 'poignant', 'moving']",N/A

1129864,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B00114XTHA,Cubist,"[2, 3]","The dreaded Oscar curse affects so many actors who win one of those golden statuettes. For some reason, after they win an Academy Award their choices in film roles is simply awful. Just look at what Kevin Spacey and Nicolas Cage have done since they won an Oscar: K-Pax and Next respectively. Halle Berry is one of the extreme examples. After winning an Academy Award forMonster's Ball, she seems to be intentionally tanking her career by making one lousy film after another (Catwoman, Gothika, etc.). Benicio Del Toro has fared better. After winning forTraffic - Criterion Collection, he's kept a pretty low-profile with the notable exception of memorable roles as a wrongly accused man in Sean Penn'sThe Pledgeand a corrupt cop inSin City - Unrated (Two-Disc Collector's Edition). Things We Lost in the Fire is an attempt to get back to basics with a low-key, character-driven drama.When her husband Bryan (Duchovny) dies suddenly, Audrey (Berry) reconnects with his life-long friend Jerry (Del Toro), a troubled drug addict. Through a series of flashbacks we see the close relationship Bryan had with Jerry and how he helped him when he was at his lowest. Early on, the film fails to commit itself on an emotional level. As soon as a scene gets emotional, director Susann Bier cuts to another scene. It's the cinematic equivalent of throwing a skipping stone across the water. Even when the characters are physically close to each other the dialogue is light. For this kind of a film we expect a certain amount of emotional intimacy between the characters. However, the film is too busy jumping back and forth in time and so we don't get settled until the scene where Audrey is told of her husband's death. Finally, someone emotes as Berry does a fine job of portraying a woman devastated by the loss of a loved one.Benicio Del Toro Method acts his way through the film making his trademark idiosyncratic choices in any given scene. He is very believable as a drug addict - especially in the scene where he goes cold turkey after a relapse. Jerry goes through all the trademark symptoms. As always, Del Toro is fascinating just to watch how he reacts to those around him, especially the kids. It's the choices he makes, like the unconventional way he reacts to a given situation, which makes him interesting to watch as an actor.Things We Lost in the Fire is a film about dealing with grief and loss and how each person deals with it. While the two leads acquit themselves admirably, the film takes too long getting us emotionally invested in their characters' plight. More importantly, it's a good career move for Halle Berry who finally does something of substance and quality. Hopefully, her next role will be even better and maybe make us all forget the debacle that was Catwoman.""A Discussion About Things We Lost in the Fire"" takes a look at how the film came together from its origins as a story by screenwriter Allan Loeb. Director Susanne Bier was drawn to the characters and the contemporary setting. Berry talks about the varying degrees of shock she had to convey over the duration of the film.

1129867,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00114XTHA,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 6]","If you've seen her 2006 melodrama,After the Wedding, you can clearly tell this is a Susanne Bier film as her signature style can be seen in the handheld camerawork, the unexpected jump cuts and the heavy use of close-ups on the physical features of her principal actors during the most cathartic moments. The Danish-born director is an apt choice to guide this somber 2007 drama dealing with grief and addiction in the aftermath of an unexpected death. Showing the unfiltered responses to life-altering experiences appears to be Biers' specialty since that is exactly the focus of both films. This time, the set-up sounds more appropriate as the subject of a Lifetime TV-movie, but despite some severe contrivances, first-time screenwriter Allan Loeb is able to elevate the film by imbuing the situation with surprising candor and making the principal characters credibly flawed. Bier's distorted timeline is a bit of a nuisance at the outset, although this luckily becomes less of an issue as the movie progresses.The plot hinges on the Good Samaritan death of Steven Burke, a successful Seattle-based real estate developer whose sense of decency and devotion inadvertently triggers a series of events leading to the tragedy. Left behind are two broken people - his angry, emotionally fragile wife Audrey, who has two small children to raise by herself now, and his close friend Jerry Sunborne, a one-time lawyer who has become a full-blown junkie constantly strung out on heroin in a depressing SRO unit downtown. Even though Audrey is distrustful of Jerry, Steven has remained loyal - a point of contention that after Steven's death, motivates Audrey to invite Jerry to stay in her half-finished garage after the funeral. Their relationship becomes confused but at least, it does not make a predictable turn toward a romance. Instead, we witness Audrey's almost instantaneous dependency on Jerry and her subsequent resentment of him when he becomes a father figure for her children. From that point, it becomes gradually clearer that both need to move forward with their lives in light of their personal limitations.As Jerry, Benicio Del Toro inhabits his role to maximum effect, bringing a haunted quality that he leavens with his natural charisma. He is particularly harrowing during his character's detoxification, and you can't help but root for his recovery no matter how uncertain it may be. Finally challenged by a role comparable to her breakthrough in Marc Forster'sMonster's Ball, Halle Berry does an admirable job in portraying Audrey's prickliness while maintaining a sympathetic core. At the same time, she is saddled with more of the plot contrivances than Del Toro and has a breakdown scene that feels a bit too calculated. David Duchovny's natural likeability helps make Steven more than just an elliptical plot device, though his screen time is understandably limited to brief flashbacks. Alexis Llewellyn and Micah Berry (no relation to Halle) believably play Audrey's children, while John Carroll Lynch (the prime suspect inZodiac) provides welcome comedy relief as the Burkes' jogging neighbor, a real estate broker who wants to help Jerry turn his life around. Even though his character is supportive to the point of being idealized, Omar Benson Miller effectively plays Audrey's too-good-to-be-true younger brother, and Alison Lohman (White Oleander) shows up late in the film as a persistently inquisitive recovering addict.The 2008 DVD is relatively sparse on extras. There is no commentary track from Bier or the principal actors, but there is a twenty-minute making-of featurette, ""A Discussion About `Things We Lost in the Fire'"", which features comments from Bier, Loeb, producers Sam Mendes (American Beauty) and Sam Mercer, Berry, Del Toro, Duchovny, Lohman and Miller. Most of the focus is on Bier and Mendes who discuss getting the film off the ground, how she works with the actors and how the look of the film was achieved. Running about nine minutes, seven deleted scenes are included, mainly filler dialogue scenes that were understandably excised except for one with Jerry and a fellow addict out on the streets. The last extra is the original theatrical trailer. By the way, the film's title refers to Audrey's emotional catharsis when she reads an inventory list of things that were destroyed in the garage during an electrical fire prior to Steven's death.",4,Grief and Addiction Intertwine in an Affecting Drama Bolstered by Del Toro's Towering Performance,1205107200,"03 10, 2008",2008,4399,"[""'ve"", 'seen', '2006', 'melodrama', 'Wedding', 'can', 'clearly', 'tell', 'Susanne', 'Bier', 'film', 'signature', 'style', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'handheld', 'camerawork', 'unexpected', 'jump', 'cuts', 'heavy', 'use', 'close-ups', 'physical', 'features', 'principal', 'actors', 'most', 'cathartic', 'moments', 'Danish-born', 'director', 'apt', 'choice', 'guide', 'somber', '2007', 'drama', 'dealing', 'grief', 'addiction', 'aftermath', 'unexpected', 'death', 'Showing', 'unfiltered', 'responses', 'life-altering', 'experiences', 'be', 'Biers', 'specialty', 'exactly', 'focus', 'films', 'time', 'set-up', 'sounds', 'more', 'appropriate', 'subject', 'Lifetime', 'TV-movie', 'severe', 'contrivances', 'first-time', 'screenwriter', 'Allan', 'Loeb', 'able', 'elevate', 'film', 'imbuing', 'situation', 'surprising', 'candor', 'making', 'principal', 'characters', 'credibly', 'flawed', 'Bier', 'distorted', 'timeline', 'bit', 'nuisance', 'outset', 'luckily', 'less', 'issue', 'movie', 'progresses.The', 'plot', 'hinges', 'Good', 'Samaritan', 'death', 'Steven', 'Burke', 'successful', 'Seattle-based', 'real', 'estate', 'developer', 'sense', 'decency', 'devotion', 'inadvertently', 'series', 'events', 'leading', 'tragedy', 'Left', 'behind', 'are', 'two', 'broken', 'people', 'angry', 'emotionally', 'fragile', 'wife', 'Audrey', 'who', 'two', 'small', 'children', 'raise', 'now', 'close', 'friend', 'Jerry', 'Sunborne', 'one-time', 'lawyer', 'who', 'become', 'full-blown', 'junkie', 'constantly', 'out', 'heroin', 'depressing', 'SRO', 'unit', 'downtown', 'Even', 'Audrey', 'distrustful', 'Jerry', 'Steven', 'remained', 'loyal', 'point', 'contention', 'Steven', 'death', 'Audrey', 'invite', 'Jerry', 'stay', 'half-finished', 'garage', 'funeral', 'relationship', 'confused', 'least', 'not', 'make', 'predictable', 'turn', 'romance', 'Instead', 'witness', 'Audrey', 'almost', 'instantaneous', 'dependency', 'Jerry', 'subsequent', 'resentment', 'when', 'father', 'figure', 'children', 'point', 'gradually', 'clearer', 'need', 'move', 'forward', 'lives', 'light', 'personal', 'limitations.As', 'Jerry', 'Benicio', 'Del', 'Toro', 'role', 'maximum', 'effect', 'bringing', 'haunted', 'quality', 'natural', 'charisma', 'particularly', 'harrowing', 'character', 'detoxification', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'root', 'recovery', 'matter', 'how', 'uncertain', 'may', 'be', 'Finally', 'challenged', 'role', 'comparable', 'breakthrough', 'Marc', ""Forster'sMonster"", 'Ball', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'admirable', 'job', 'portraying', 'Audrey', 'prickliness', 'maintaining', 'sympathetic', 'core', 'same', 'time', 'saddled', 'more', 'plot', 'contrivances', 'Del', 'Toro', 'breakdown', 'scene', 'bit', 'too', 'calculated', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'natural', 'likeability', 'make', 'Steven', 'more', 'just', 'elliptical', 'plot', 'device', 'screen', 'time', 'understandably', 'limited', 'brief', 'flashbacks', 'Alexis', 'Llewellyn', 'Micah', 'Berry', 'relation', 'Halle', 'believably', 'play', 'Audrey', 'children', 'John', 'Carroll', 'Lynch', 'prime', 'suspect', 'inZodiac', 'welcome', 'comedy', 'relief', 'Burkes', 'jogging', 'neighbor', 'real', 'estate', 'broker', 'who', 'help', 'Jerry', 'turn', 'life', 'Even', 'character', 'supportive', 'point', 'being', 'idealized', 'Omar', 'Benson', 'Miller', 'effectively', 'Audrey', 'too-good-to-be-true', 'younger', 'brother', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'White', 'Oleander', 'up', 'late', 'film', 'persistently', 'inquisitive', 'recovering', 'addict.The', '2008', 'DVD', 'relatively', 'sparse', 'extras', 'commentary', 'track', 'Bier', 'principal', 'actors', 'twenty-minute', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'Discussion', 'Things', 'Lost', 'Fire', 'comments', 'Bier', 'Loeb', 'producers', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'American', 'Beauty', 'Sam', 'Mercer', 'Berry', 'Del', 'Toro', 'Duchovny', 'Lohman', 'Miller', 'Most', 'focus', 'Bier', 'Mendes', 'who', 'discuss', 'getting', 'film', 'ground', 'how', 'actors', 'how', 'look', 'film', 'was', 'achieved', 'Running', 'about', 'nine', 'minutes', 'seven', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'included', 'mainly', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'were', 'understandably', 'excised', 'one', 'Jerry', 'fellow', 'addict', 'streets', 'last', 'extra', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'way', 'film', 'title', 'refers', 'Audrey', 'emotional', 'catharsis', 'when', 'inventory', 'list', 'things', 'were', 'destroyed', 'garage', 'electrical', 'fire', 'prior', 'Steven', 'death']",N/A

This film explores very profound issues and themes like grief, friendship, addiction, and our fleet and seemingly fragile existence on this planet.  How do we relate to our loved ones, the people we don't really like, and strangers, and how those relationships evolve in the face of some of these themes/issues?  It's that rare combination of the material asking the right questions with the right performers and performances.

(Catwoman, BAPS, Perfect Stranger). TWLITF is one of the former movies, and Halle should do more of them.This is the story of Audrey (Berry) who loses her husband Brian (Duchovny) in a senseless tragedy.  It is also the story of Jerry (del Toro) who is a junkie on the road to recovery. The rest of the movie is Audrey, her two adorable kids, and Jerry trying to make sense of what happened to Brian and trying to overcome grief and addiction.The film is not without its problems, but it is worth watching. I enjoy movies that are about characters as opposed to characters being puppets on plot strings.  Duchovny is seen mostly through flashbacks, but even through those, we can see how much his family loved him and how crucial he was to Jerry.  Halle embraces her character and gives the audience a chance to see Audrey's pain.  Some of the things her character does seem over the top in trying to handle her grief, but through the flashbacks and what we grasp about her character, it's believable.  Benicio as Jerry, delivers a good performance, per usual.  The bond that develops between Jerry and the kids is nice to watch.  Both Audrey and the kids cling to Jerry to fill the void left by Brian's death, and Benicio plays Jerry perfectly as someone who sees this yet knows he's too screwed up to even attempt it, but tries his best with what he can.Yes, the focus on the eyes WAS lame, and added the nothing to the picture.  I think part of my appreciation for TWLITF is that it was very possible for both leads to overact in cringe-worthy ways, but they both exhibited restraint. I am sooo very glad that the movie didn't take the turn I expected it to with Jerry and Audrey, as it would have cheapened the movie.  The script wasn't without fault and neither was the direction, but it was a very watchable vehicle for Berry and del Toro.  And I say this as someone who barely tolerates Halle (I believe she can act, but should be more selective in her roles). Award winning? Probably not.

1129870,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00114XTHA,Grady Harp,"[31, 31]","Few films released last year have the quiet sensitivity in writing (Allan Loeb), direction (Susanne Bier), cinematography (Tom Stern), and acting (Berry, Del Toro, Duchovny) as this gem of a movie.  Taking on a subject of grief after a sudden traumatic death and the way it affects family and friends would seem like a tedious subject for a two hour film, but THINGS WE LOST IN THE FIRE proves again that care and devotion in telling a difficult story with restraint and tenderness is far more compelling that many of the 'big' movies that fill the theaters with more superficial topics.Brian Burke (David Duchovny) is a generously warm man to his beautiful wife Audrey (Halle Berry), their son Dory (Micah Berry), and daughterHarper (Alexis Llewellyn) as well as to his longtime, childhood friend Jerry Sunborne (Benecio Del Toro) who is constantly struggling with an addiction to heroin. Brian is suddenly dead as the film opens and the friends are gathered at the Burke home for the funeral.  Audrey is devastated by the abrupt loss and quietly bears her shock in order to be present for her children.  During the reception Audrey suddenly remembers she has not informed Brian's best friend Jerry of his death and sends her brother to fetch him for the services.  We meet the wasted Jerry, the shambles of his heroin-addicted life obvious in his tiny apartment, and yet when Jerry hears the news of Brian's death, he is profoundly shocked: Brian is the only friend he has.  Jerry makes himself presentable and attends the funeral and despite the fact that Audrey had always considered Jerry  a 'weight' on Brian, the two offer each other a zone of connection that cannot be filled by any other.  Slowly Jerry becomes part of the Burke household and his role in offering love to the children and solace and protection to Audry results in changes in Jerry's life that provides one bit of evidence of the redemption that can occur from shared grieving. 'Things', such as those items lost in a fire at the Burke's in the past, are simply 'things': interpersonal connection, hope, and the 'light from within' are what truly matter.Berry and Del Toro give finely nuanced performances in these difficult roles, further establishing their credentials as being two of our finest actors in film.  But the entire cast of this film is pitch-perfect and under the direction of Bier communicates powerfully with the viewer.  The extraordinary camera work concentrates on extreme closeup views of eyes, hands, lips and tears and allows the viewer an intimate relationship with these characters.  Johan S&ouml;derqvist provides a subtle musical score that underlines the story without calling attention to itself.  For this viewer this is hands down one of the finest films of 2007.

Bucking that trend, Things We Lost in the Fire takes a deliberately slow approach - perhaps better described as realistic and thoughtful - exposing the heart-wrenching emotions experienced by recent survivors of loved ones.Shown nonlinearly (but not quite like Memento), the film follows two leads - Audrey Burke (Halle Berry) and Jerry Sunborne (Benicio Del Toro) - struggling with the recent death of Brian Burke (David Duchovny), who was a husband and friend, respectively.  As a recovering heroin addict, Jerry is in search for support, and Audrey, an emotionally fragile woman, has had her world collapse now that her husband has widowed her with two young children.  The perceptions of good and bad, needy and nurturing, are juxtaposed interestingly so that each of the characters surprises with their reaction to Brian's death.  Both need each other and they bond to overcome whatever previous issues they may have had with one another.As a character study, this movie is off the charts.  Excellenct job from Halle and Benicio.  As an underdog, Jerry unbelievably edges out Audrey for sympathy.  Despite an understanding of how each character is coping, Audrey has multiple moments in which she is not only unlikeable, but downright mean and selfish.  During one poignant scene she invites Jerry to rub her ear in bed (which is not a euphemism), like Brian used to, in order for her to fall asleep.  The concept is touching but incredibly selfish considering Jerry's obvious difficulties with temptation.  Thankfully, the movie didn't devolve with a contrived and completely unbelievable romance.Director Susanne Bier creates a very sentimental, morose image, which suits the overall tone of the film perfectly.  Despite her eye close-up fetish - something that reminded me of Tarantino's foot shots - each scene and character is shot in a complimenting fashion.  Perhaps it's easier because it's VERY difficult to make Halle Berry unattractive, and Del Toro's weathered face gives him the appearance of a drug addict, but it's nonetheless done very well.Gradual yet approaching stagnant, nothing will wow, but Things We Lost in the Fire is recommended for a heartfelt human drama fans escaping ninjas, hobbits, and transforming robots.  It will probably be enjoyed, however, by fans of sparkling vampires.Jason Elin",3,Rehab of the Heart,1273017600,"05 5, 2010",2010,2550,"['today', 'me-first', 'self-centered', 'drive-thru', 'world', 'must', 'be', 'awfully', 'difficult', 'producers', 'directors', 'make', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'contain', 'T', 'A', 'overblown', 'FX', 'substitute', 'also', 'known', 'recent', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'films', 'Bucking', 'trend', 'Things', 'Lost', 'Fire', 'deliberately', 'slow', 'approach', 'perhaps', 'better', 'described', 'realistic', 'thoughtful', 'exposing', 'heart-wrenching', 'emotions', 'experienced', 'recent', 'survivors', 'loved', 'ones.Shown', 'nonlinearly', 'not', 'quite', 'Memento', 'film', 'two', 'leads', 'Audrey', 'Burke', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Jerry', 'Sunborne', 'Benicio', 'Del', 'Toro', 'struggling', 'recent', 'death', 'Brian', 'Burke', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'who', 'was', 'husband', 'friend', 'respectively', 'recovering', 'heroin', 'addict', 'Jerry', 'search', 'support', 'Audrey', 'emotionally', 'fragile', 'woman', 'had', 'world', 'collapse', 'now', 'husband', 'widowed', 'two', 'young', 'children', 'perceptions', 'good', 'bad', 'needy', 'nurturing', 'are', 'juxtaposed', 'interestingly', 'so', 'characters', 'surprises', 'reaction', 'Brian', 'death', 'need', 'other', 'bond', 'overcome', 'previous', 'issues', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'one', 'another.As', 'character', 'study', 'movie', 'charts', 'Excellenct', 'job', 'Halle', 'Benicio', 'underdog', 'Jerry', 'unbelievably', 'out', 'Audrey', 'sympathy', 'understanding', 'how', 'character', 'coping', 'Audrey', 'multiple', 'moments', 'not', 'only', 'unlikeable', 'downright', 'mean', 'selfish', 'one', 'poignant', 'scene', 'Jerry', 'rub', 'ear', 'bed', 'not', 'euphemism', 'Brian', 'used', 'order', 'fall', 'asleep', 'concept', 'touching', 'incredibly', 'selfish', 'considering', 'Jerry', 'obvious', 'difficulties', 'temptation', 'Thankfully', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'devolve', 'contrived', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'romance.Director', 'Susanne', 'Bier', 'very', 'sentimental', 'morose', 'image', 'suits', 'overall', 'tone', 'film', 'perfectly', 'eye', 'close-up', 'fetish', 'something', 'reminded', 'Tarantino', 'foot', 'shots', 'scene', 'character', 'shot', 'complimenting', 'fashion', 'Perhaps', 'easier', 'VERY', 'difficult', 'make', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'unattractive', 'Del', 'Toro', 'weathered', 'face', 'appearance', 'drug', 'addict', 'nonetheless', 'done', 'very', 'well.Gradual', 'yet', 'approaching', 'stagnant', 'nothing', 'will', 'wow', 'Things', 'Lost', 'Fire', 'recommended', 'heartfelt', 'human', 'drama', 'fans', 'escaping', 'ninjas', 'hobbits', 'transforming', 'robots', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'however', 'fans', 'sparkling', 'vampires.Jason', 'Elin']",N/A

""TWLITF"" stars the enigmatic Benicio Del Toro and the wondrous Halle Berry.The facility of the Oscar-winning Benecio Del Toro with emotional material, very much in evidence here, is not a surprise. But it is especially satisfying to report that, as widow and mother Audrey Burke, Berry, who has made some unfortunate career choices, does what's easily her best work since winning her Academy Award for 2001's ""Monster's Ball.""The tragedy of this film is that Audrey's husband, Brian (David Ducovny) dies and it leaves her and her children at a loss emotionally and psychologically: how will they deal with this? Out of no-where, because up to this point Audrey has avoided contact with him, she invites Brian's friend Jerry Sunborne (Del Toro), her husband's best friend since childhood, who has gone in and out of heroin addiction as long as she's known him, to the funeral.""I hated you for so many years and now it seems silly,"" Audrey tells him when he arrives. Deprived of the only person who hadn't given up on him, Jerry is as much at a loss in his life as Audrey is. With nothing in common except the dead man, these two tentatively gravitate toward an emotional d&eacute;tente that might allow each of them to keep living.Like Ang Lee, Bier's mise en scene comes from an emotional,thoughtful, premierely humane and prescient place thatAudrey and Jerry's relationship pops with cosmic truth. Here are two people adrift in a morass of guilt, despair and grief which, instead of driving them apart, brings them together despite their reluctance to form a bond with anyone. They both approach their relationship like two sinking ships searching for the lighthouse that will lead them to emotional equilibrium.

Schultz,"[0, 0]","The two stars of this film, Halle Berry and Benicio Del Toro, are really beautiful people, and if you're satisfied to just soak up beauty, this film is for you. But if you're looking for characters who are truly ""fluorescent,"" in the sense of being lit from within - I think you'd better look elsewhere. That's because this becomes just another film that automatically attributes depth and drama to drug addiction and that then follows one recidivist user into the AA platitudes of ""my drug of choice"" and ""one day at a time."" It's perhaps no wonder that so many people are turning to drugs, because only such descent and struggle seems to lend potential cinematic significance to one's life.To be fair though, this film is about more than attempts at redeeming a drug user. It's also about coping with the death of a beloved spouse, and about what constitutes real friendship. Berry's bereaved widow character realizes that her husband's friend was more than just a leech, sucking up her husband's time and sympathy with his drug use. She realizes that Del Toro's character of Jerry contributed something very valuable to the relationship. He listened. He remembered. So when Jerry comes to his friend's funeral and subsequently moves in with the widow, she feels almost upstaged when she sees he knows more tender details about her children, about her deceased husband's likes and dislikes, about her - than she herself in all her daily busy-ness - ever stopped to appreciate.This would have been a good premise to pursue. But the movie gets bogged down in slow, sparse exchanges exhaled into the ether. It also gets bogged down in improbabilities. For example, we see Berry inviting Del Toro platonically into her bed to massage her ear, a service she was used to enlisting her husband to perform for her in order to soothe her to sleep. Also, Berry's neighbor takes an immediate, unlikely shine to this recovering drug addict who has moved into Berry's garage. The neighbor encourages Del Toro to join him for daily jogs, and then tutors and sponsors him in becoming a mortgage broker. Del Toro is seen mastering the abstruse material for his broker's test in a mere sixty days, something that would be VERY unlikely to sustain a recovering drug addict's attention.So much artiness is imposed on the relationships here, that despite some good lines (as when Del Toro describes his first hit of drugs like being ""kissed by God"") - the film drags down into standard, socially conscious angst. The problem is summarized by the directorial decision to have frequent close-ups of the character's eyes, or more typically, of one of their eyes off-center on the screen. These eyes invariably are red-rimmed and strangely, seem to have incipient cataracts forming over them.That is sort of symbolic of this entire movie.

This follows a woman, Audrey, who loses her husband and struggles to come to terms with her loss and also his best friend, Jerry, who is a recovering Heroin addict and who moves in with the family to help in his recovery. It soon becomes obvious that he helps the family as much as they help him. It is very sad when Audrey uses Jerry to replace certain aspects of her husband, even when she isn't aware she is doing it, because she needs to emotional intimacy and companionship during a hard time in her life. It is even sadder when she then rejects Jerry when he unwittingly reminds her of her husband just by the fact that he is there and her husband isn't. This is brilliantly acted by all involved and both Halle Berry and Benicio Del Toro show just what exceptional actors they are. Berry shows the various levels of shock perfectly and rather than being just a frozen woman, she plays it with nuance and depth. The children are great actors as well and you never once cringe at `cutesy' or inauthentic acting from them. This is a modern day weepy and one that is well worth watching.

1129891,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B00114XTHA,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[49, 61]","I really wanted to like this film as I'm a huge fan of Halle Berry and the storyline just looked so compelling on paper.  However, the delivery of this story just falls flat.The story is told in present tense, but cleverly spliced in flashbacks fill in the background.  Halle plays Audrey Bruke, a mother of two, whose husband Brian, played by ""X Files"" David Duchovny, is killed (I won't spoil the story by stating how, but we are told he's killed early on).  We learn via the flashbacks that his childhood friend, Jerry, very well played by Del Toro, with whom he is still close is now a heroin addict and that Brian is the only friend he has left checks on him regularly and buys him food much to Audrey irritation as she worries about him going to see Jerry in the very bad neighborhood in which he lives.Perhaps as a way of hanging onto her dead husband's memory or simply out of a selfish need for company, Audrey invites Jerry to ""recover"" from his addiction at her home in the garage that was made into a studio apartment after a fire in which she recalls endlessly complaining about ""what we lost in the fire"", but to which her husband Brian always used to say ""but we didn't lose each other and that's the important thing in life"", hence, the film's title.Audrey's character is complex to say the least as she makes demands of Jerry that are inappropriate and selfish, like helping her fall to sleep at night by rubbing her ears the way her Brian had at bedtime.  The whole scene screams false and contrived to begin with, but add to that that she invites Jerry to kind of be a part of the family and then resents his closeness to the kids later.  Again, she's a complex character, but numerous moments stretch credibility when juxtaposed to more credible moments.  I have no problem with her bringing home her husband's best friend as that makes sense to me for someone who just lost a spouse and may want to hang onto his memory somehow or continue his work so-to-speak in helping his friend, but the silly and contrived scene of him getting into her bed, on her husband's side (I think would be scared place to her), and have him give her an ear massage like her husband did is over-the-top corny and diminishes the impact of other more believable scenes.The acting by all is quite good, however, the dialogue struggles from the weight of someone who may have watched too many Dr. Phil episodes and concludes with . . . drum roll, please . . . ""we must live one day at a time.""  I kid you not; that is a direct quote from the film.  This is the depth of the psychology in this film that I feel treats its subject matter far too superficially.  I found myself greatly insulted by this kind of clich&eacute;-ridden lecturing.  Even the children are given silly supposedly psychological lines to say when the one daughter yells at Jerry for leaving ""after you tried to take my father's place.""  I'm sorry kids just don't talk this way and I've witnessed my fair share of broken families personally and as a veteran teacher.  It is the way people THINK others will speak in such situations and it creaks and groans under it's own contrived weight.In addition to a seriously faulty script at times (there are some very good moments in the dialogue), the direction it appears was also lost in the fire.  Danish director Susanne Bier seems to think that extreme close-ups of eyes makes her film somehow artsy or clever or important, but both my wife and I kept scratching our heads wondering what was with these long drawn out eyeball close-ups.  They made no sense, there was no symbolism in it, and they didn't advance the story any and act only as a distraction.  The story also seems to meander around too much in which some better editing and trimming of the film would have made some difference.  The best compliment I can give to the director is that she allowed her talented actors to just do their thing with little control over them (perhaps why she resorted to bizarre shots in order to put her ""stamp"" on the film) and she did cleverly insert the flashback scenes at appropriate times and they were quite telling and compelling.I still give this film three stars as the acting is quite good, the topic is touching, and Audrey, as played by Halle Berry, is a complex character and I enjoy those when I can get them, but the script, direction and editing take their toll on a film that could have and should have been so much better than it was.  Overall, it wasn't a ""bad"" film, it was just one in which it was disappointing because it could have been so much better.  Remember, that three stars means a film is good and I do recommend this one with some reservations as there are some glaring problems with this film that could really agitate some (and some may dismiss them as no big deal).",3,What was lost in the fire was an opportunity for a better film.,1206921600,"03 31, 2008",2008,4809,"['really', 'wanted', 'like', 'film', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'storyline', 'just', 'looked', 'so', 'compelling', 'paper', 'However', 'delivery', 'story', 'just', 'flat.The', 'story', 'told', 'present', 'tense', 'cleverly', 'spliced', 'flashbacks', 'fill', 'background', 'Halle', 'Audrey', 'Bruke', 'mother', 'two', 'husband', 'Brian', 'played', 'X', 'Files', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'killed', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'story', 'stating', 'how', 'are', 'told', 'killed', 'early', 'learn', 'flashbacks', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Jerry', 'very', 'well', 'played', 'Del', 'Toro', 'whom', 'still', 'close', 'now', 'heroin', 'addict', 'Brian', 'only', 'friend', 'left', 'checks', 'regularly', 'food', 'much', 'Audrey', 'irritation', 'going', 'see', 'Jerry', 'very', 'bad', 'neighborhood', 'way', 'hanging', 'dead', 'husband', 'memory', 'simply', 'selfish', 'need', 'company', 'Audrey', 'Jerry', 'recover', 'addiction', 'home', 'garage', 'was', 'made', 'studio', 'apartment', 'fire', 'endlessly', 'complaining', 'what', 'lost', 'fire', 'husband', 'Brian', 'always', 'used', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'lose', 'other', 'important', 'thing', 'life', 'hence', 'film', 'title.Audrey', 'character', 'complex', 'say', 'least', 'demands', 'Jerry', 'are', 'inappropriate', 'selfish', 'helping', 'fall', 'sleep', 'night', 'rubbing', 'ears', 'way', 'Brian', 'had', 'bedtime', 'whole', 'scene', 'screams', 'false', 'contrived', 'begin', 'add', 'Jerry', 'kind', 'be', 'part', 'family', 'then', 'resents', 'closeness', 'kids', 'later', 'Again', 'complex', 'character', 'numerous', 'moments', 'stretch', 'credibility', 'when', 'juxtaposed', 'more', 'credible', 'moments', 'have', 'problem', 'bringing', 'home', 'husband', 'best', 'friend', 'sense', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'lost', 'spouse', 'may', 'want', 'hang', 'memory', 'somehow', 'continue', 'work', 'so-to-speak', 'helping', 'friend', 'silly', 'contrived', 'scene', 'getting', 'bed', 'husband', 'side', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'scared', 'place', 'have', 'give', 'ear', 'massage', 'husband', 'did', 'over-the-top', 'corny', 'impact', 'other', 'more', 'believable', 'scenes.The', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'however', 'dialogue', 'weight', 'someone', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'watched', 'too', 'many', 'Dr.', 'Phil', 'episodes', 'concludes', 'drum', 'roll', 'please', 'must', 'live', 'one', 'day', 'time', 'kid', 'not', 'direct', 'quote', 'film', 'depth', 'psychology', 'film', 'feel', 'treats', 'subject', 'matter', 'far', 'too', 'superficially', 'found', 'greatly', 'insulted', 'kind', 'clich', 'eacute', '-ridden', 'lecturing', 'Even', 'children', 'are', 'given', 'silly', 'supposedly', 'psychological', 'lines', 'say', 'when', 'one', 'daughter', 'yells', 'Jerry', 'leaving', 'tried', 'take', 'father', 'place', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'kids', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'way', ""'ve"", 'witnessed', 'fair', 'share', 'broken', 'families', 'personally', 'veteran', 'teacher', 'way', 'people', 'THINK', 'others', 'will', 'speak', 'such', 'situations', 'groans', 'own', 'contrived', 'weight.In', 'addition', 'seriously', 'faulty', 'script', 'times', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'moments', 'dialogue', 'direction', 'was', 'also', 'lost', 'fire', 'Danish', 'director', 'Susanne', 'Bier', 'think', 'extreme', 'close-ups', 'eyes', 'film', 'somehow', 'artsy', 'clever', 'important', 'wife', 'kept', 'scratching', 'heads', 'wondering', 'what', 'was', 'long', 'drawn', 'close-ups', 'made', 'sense', 'was', 'symbolism', 'did', ""n't"", 'advance', 'story', 'act', 'only', 'distraction', 'story', 'also', 'meander', 'too', 'much', 'better', 'editing', 'trimming', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'difference', 'best', 'compliment', 'can', 'give', 'director', 'allowed', 'talented', 'actors', 'just', 'do', 'thing', 'little', 'control', 'perhaps', 'why', 'resorted', 'bizarre', 'shots', 'order', 'put', 'stamp', 'film', 'did', 'cleverly', 'insert', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'appropriate', 'times', 'were', 'quite', 'telling', 'compelling.I', 'still', 'give', 'film', 'three', 'stars', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'topic', 'touching', 'Audrey', 'played', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'complex', 'character', 'enjoy', 'when', 'can', 'get', 'script', 'direction', 'editing', 'take', 'toll', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'Overall', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'was', 'disappointing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Remember', 'three', 'stars', 'film', 'good', 'do', 'recommend', 'one', 'reservations', 'are', 'glaring', 'problems', 'film', 'could', 'really', 'agitate', 'may', 'dismiss', 'big', 'deal']",N/A

Three words never meant so much after the loss, despair and redemption the characters in ""Things We Lost in the Fire"" experience.

Halle Berry delivers her finest performance as the distraught widow of David Duchovny's character. Moments of kind gesture and jealous rage flip-flop throughout the movie. And yet, Benicio Del Toro's drug-addicted character remains consistently optimistic and nurturing through most of the trials and tribulations.The musical score is beautiful. And in my opinion, the intricate camera shots show fragments of the characters' body, especially the eyes, to emphasize their broken state of mind.

Halle Berry in one her finest performances [since Monster's Ball] plays a widow, Audrey Burke, who is deeply grieving the tragic death of her beloved husband Brian[played by David Duchovny in a very brief but memorable role]. She invites her late husband's best friend, Jerry [Benicio del Toro in an amazing performance] to come live with them with the intent that he will help with their grieving process [he gets along really well with the kids, 10 year-old girl and 6 year-old boy], and also help him sort his life out [he's a recovering heroin addict].The premise of the story may seem straight-forward but it's so much more complicated - Audrey is so wrapped up in her pain that she lashes out at everyone - her kids, and particularly Jerry, to the extent that at one point she asks Jerry why he wasn't the one who died. On the other side, Jerry struggles with his addiction issues whilst trying to be a better person for the sake of Audrey and the kids, the family of the only guy [Brian] who ever cared about him.The two main leads, Halle Berry as Audrey and Benicio del Toro as Jerry give finely nuanced performances as two lost souls with so much pain and conflict within them, trying to come to terms with their realities, and basically struggling to move on with their lives. The point that comes across clearly here is that life rarely flows through a predictable pattern, and we all have to learn to deal with the realities of our choices and circumstances, be it grieving the sudden loss of a loved one or a personal problem [like addiction, anger etc].This isn't a light or fun movie to sit through, but if you're up for an emotional drama that deals with serious life issues, then ""Things We Lost in the Fire"" just might touch you.",4,A poignant human drama that deals with grieving and addiction,1228608000,"12 7, 2008",2008,1867,"['Things', 'Lost', 'Fire', 'riveting', 'human', 'drama', 'deals', 'process', 'grieving', 'loss', 'loved', 'one', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', '[', 'Monster', 'Ball', ']', 'widow', 'Audrey', 'Burke', 'who', 'deeply', 'grieving', 'tragic', 'death', 'beloved', 'husband', 'Brian', '[', 'played', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'very', 'brief', 'memorable', 'role', ']', 'late', 'husband', 'best', 'friend', 'Jerry', '[', 'Benicio', 'del', 'Toro', 'amazing', 'performance', ']', 'come', 'live', 'intent', 'will', 'help', 'grieving', 'process', 'along', 'really', 'well', 'kids', '10', 'year-old', 'girl', '6', 'year-old', 'boy', ']', 'also', 'help', 'sort', 'life', '[', 'recovering', 'heroin', 'addict', ']', '.The', 'premise', 'story', 'may', 'seem', 'straight-forward', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'complicated', 'Audrey', 'so', 'wrapped', 'up', 'pain', 'out', 'everyone', 'kids', 'particularly', 'Jerry', 'extent', 'one', 'point', 'Jerry', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'who', 'died', 'other', 'side', 'Jerry', 'addiction', 'issues', 'whilst', 'trying', 'be', 'better', 'person', 'sake', 'Audrey', 'kids', 'family', 'only', 'guy', '[', 'Brian', ']', 'who', 'ever', 'cared', 'him.The', 'two', 'main', 'leads', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Audrey', 'Benicio', 'del', 'Toro', 'Jerry', 'give', 'finely', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'two', 'lost', 'souls', 'so', 'much', 'pain', 'conflict', 'trying', 'come', 'terms', 'realities', 'basically', 'struggling', 'move', 'lives', 'point', 'clearly', 'here', 'life', 'rarely', 'predictable', 'pattern', 'have', 'learn', 'deal', 'realities', 'choices', 'circumstances', 'be', 'grieving', 'sudden', 'loss', 'loved', 'one', 'personal', 'problem', '[', 'addiction', 'anger', 'etc', ']', '.This', ""n't"", 'light', 'fun', 'movie', 'sit', ""'re"", 'up', 'emotional', 'drama', 'deals', 'serious', 'life', 'issues', 'then', 'Things', 'Lost', 'Fire', 'just', 'might', 'touch']",N/A
