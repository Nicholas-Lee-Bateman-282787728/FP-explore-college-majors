831954,A2GPEV42IO41CI,B0002ERWZU,Kona,"[3, 6]","It is the 1850s in a rocky New England farm that is home to the despotic owner, Ephraim Cabot (Burl Ives) and his resentful son Eben (Anthony Perkins).  At 25, Eben is only staying on the farm because he expects to inherit the land, even though his greedy and cruel father swears that will never happen.  The old man goes off and marries Anna (Sophia Loren), a seductive woman of Eben's age.  She is repulsed by her husband, but desperately wants the farm, so there is immediate friction between Anna and her new stepson.  Hatred soon turns to lust, however, and the two make good use of the hay loft.  Anna gives birth to a son and Ephraim declares that the farm will be his alone one day, a decision that leads to a shocking act.Eugene O'Neill's classic tragedy makes just an OK transition to the screen, despite the talented cast, literate script, and dramatic score by Elmer Bernstein.  Something is missing; one never feels any passion or joy or urgency between Eben and Anna; in fact, they both seem to sleepwalk through the story, reciting their lines when it's their turn and glowering throughout.  The one who really shines is Burl Ives; he is totally convincing as the hateful, Bible-quoting father and his robust and gleefully evil performance is reason enough to watch the movie.  A big problem was the farm; it was the sole location and the object of everyone's desire, and yet the scenes were obviously filmed indoors, giving it a false, stagey look.  The pervasive mood is of unremitting gloom, and since none of the characters is likeable or heroic, one is left feeling empty, wishing there had been more of an emotional connection between them and with us.",3,"Gloom, doom, and Loren",1186358400,"08 6, 2007",2007,1673,"['1850s', 'rocky', 'New', 'England', 'farm', 'home', 'despotic', 'owner', 'Ephraim', 'Cabot', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'resentful', 'son', 'Eben', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', '25', 'Eben', 'only', 'staying', 'farm', 'inherit', 'land', 'even', 'greedy', 'cruel', 'father', 'will', 'never', 'happen', 'old', 'man', 'off', 'marries', 'Anna', 'Sophia', 'Loren', 'seductive', 'woman', 'Eben', 'age', 'repulsed', 'husband', 'desperately', 'farm', 'immediate', 'friction', 'Anna', 'new', 'stepson', 'Hatred', 'soon', 'lust', 'however', 'two', 'make', 'good', 'use', 'hay', 'loft', 'Anna', 'birth', 'son', 'Ephraim', 'farm', 'will', 'be', 'alone', 'one', 'day', 'decision', 'shocking', 'act.Eugene', ""O'Neill"", 'classic', 'tragedy', 'just', 'OK', 'transition', 'screen', 'talented', 'cast', 'literate', 'script', 'dramatic', 'score', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'Something', 'missing', 'one', 'never', 'passion', 'joy', 'urgency', 'Eben', 'Anna', 'fact', 'seem', 'sleepwalk', 'story', 'reciting', 'lines', 'when', 'turn', 'glowering', 'one', 'who', 'really', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'totally', 'convincing', 'hateful', 'Bible-quoting', 'father', 'robust', 'gleefully', 'evil', 'performance', 'reason', 'enough', 'watch', 'movie', 'big', 'problem', 'was', 'farm', 'was', 'sole', 'location', 'object', 'everyone', 'desire', 'yet', 'scenes', 'were', 'obviously', 'filmed', 'indoors', 'giving', 'false', 'stagey', 'look', 'pervasive', 'mood', 'unremitting', 'gloom', 'none', 'characters', 'likeable', 'heroic', 'one', 'left', 'feeling', 'empty', 'wishing', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'emotional', 'connection']",N/A
831955,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B0002ERWZU,Linda Linguvic,"[3, 3]","This is a classic film in every sense of the word.  Taken from an original Eugene O'Neill work, with a screenplay by Irwin Shaw, this 1958 film is shot in black and white, underscoring the sparse rock-filled Vermont landscape with a chilling intensity.  Burl Ives is cast in the role of a 76-old man who takes young Sophia Loren for a wife.  There is serious conflict because he has three grown sons.  Two are from a first wife who he worked to death.  The third, Antony Perkins, is from his second wife who gave her husband the money for this farm.  She's taught her son about this when he was a boy, showing him where his father has buried his treasure and supporting him in claiming his rightful birthright.The two older sons are losers, taunting their younger brother all of their lives.  But as this young son matures, he pledges to own the land.  His mother is dead now and the three young brothers live with their father.  When the father goes away for a few weeks young Anthony Perkins takes part of the hidden treasure, gives it to his two good-for-nothing brothers and makes them sign over their inheritance of the farm to him.The father brings home Sophia Loren and soon she and Perkins are deep into a romance.  When she has a son, the father assumes it is his.  And then the plot develops into a tragedy of operatic proportions.The drama of this film is outstanding and so are the performances.  I felt I had stepped back in time, even further back than 1958 when the film was made, to the kind of drama that echoed with the passions of hundreds of years in the past.

831961,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0002ERWZU,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[17, 22]","Burl Ives plays Ephraim Cabot a greedy miser of a man who has managed to estrange his sons Peter (Pernell Roberts), Simeon (Frank Overton) but most especially Eben (Anthony Perkins) who wears bitterness like an oversized suit. When Ephraim brings home a new, young step-mother for the boys and wife, Anna (Sophia Loren) causes rivalries to begin anew between the brothers, their father but most especially Anna. It seems Ephraim has made the decision to leave the farm Anna when he dies. Eben confronts Anna but their confrontation erupts into passion as the two sleep together.Eugene O'Neill occupies the same place in American Literature as a playwright as, say, Sophocles did for the Greeks. While Sophocles told of great and heroic characters who fall from grace with the gods, O'Neill focuses on anyone from the average American to the celebrity (I suppose in our screwed up world that's what passes for a ""heroic"" figure now). O'Neill's best plays (""The Iceman Cometh"" and ""Long Day's Journey into Night"") tend to focus on the everyman and his or her struggles with temptation and how they seek their redemption. While ""Desire Under the Elms"" isn't O'Neill's best work, it still resonates with a number of difficult and forbidden themes. It's O'Neill's version of ""Oedipus"" but with characters that for all their heroic qualities, are flawed and simple human beings.That said this is a so-so film adaptation of O'Neill's play. The fault lies in making the film a ""star"" vehicle more than anything else. The script compromises the integrity of O'Neill's original play and the direction, although imaginative at times just doesn't bring the drama to life. Mann's opens up the play a bit but some of the sequences still have a static quality to them. The performances range from decent to so over-the-top that they add a campy quality to the film and bring out the soap opera elements of O'Neill's plot. This is definitely an O'Neill play that deserves a reinterpretation despite the fact that it's a fairly minor work in his canon.Shot in Vistavision one of the earliest widescreen processes, the black and white images would probably have been a bit sharper and with better clarity if there was some sort of full scale restoration done on the film. As it is, ""Desire"" looks decent although some of the sequences look a bit muddy while other parts look a bit washed out. There's also quite a bit of analog blemishes. Given the age of the film, the black and white images look pretty decent. It's unlikely that Paramount gave the producer responsible for this film-to-DVD transfer the budget for the necessary restoration of this film. The sound is pretty decent although the frequency response isn't as good as it could be. Still, Elmer Bernstein's striking score comes across with good presence and the dialogue is fairly clear.There are no extras included. There is no commentary track.Although not a complete disaster, this adaptation of O'Neill's play leaves a lot to be desired. Basically a star vehicle for Sophia Loren and Anthony Perkins, the fine moody cinematography and director Delbert Mann's imaginative direction can't overcome a script that takes a piece meal approach to O'Neill's play.",3,So-so adaptation of O'Neill's play,1095465600,"09 18, 2004",2004,3206,"['Burl', 'Ives', 'Ephraim', 'Cabot', 'greedy', 'miser', 'man', 'who', 'managed', 'estrange', 'sons', 'Peter', 'Pernell', 'Roberts', 'Simeon', 'Frank', 'Overton', 'most', 'especially', 'Eben', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'who', 'bitterness', 'oversized', 'suit', 'When', 'Ephraim', 'home', 'new', 'young', 'step-mother', 'boys', 'wife', 'Anna', 'Sophia', 'Loren', 'rivalries', 'begin', 'anew', 'brothers', 'father', 'most', 'especially', 'Anna', 'Ephraim', 'made', 'decision', 'leave', 'farm', 'Anna', 'when', 'Eben', 'confronts', 'Anna', 'confrontation', 'passion', 'two', 'sleep', 'together.Eugene', ""O'Neill"", 'same', 'place', 'American', 'Literature', 'playwright', 'say', 'Sophocles', 'did', 'Greeks', 'Sophocles', 'told', 'great', 'heroic', 'characters', 'who', 'fall', 'grace', 'gods', ""O'Neill"", 'anyone', 'average', 'American', 'celebrity', 'suppose', 'screwed', 'up', 'world', 'what', 'heroic', 'figure', 'now', ""O'Neill"", 'best', 'plays', 'Iceman', 'Cometh', 'Long', 'Day', 'Journey', 'Night', 'tend', 'focus', 'everyman', 'struggles', 'temptation', 'how', 'seek', 'redemption', 'Desire', 'Elms', ""n't"", ""O'Neill"", 'best', 'work', 'still', 'number', 'difficult', 'forbidden', 'themes', ""O'Neill"", 'version', 'Oedipus', 'characters', 'heroic', 'qualities', 'are', 'flawed', 'simple', 'human', 'beings.That', 'said', 'so-so', 'film', 'adaptation', ""O'Neill"", 'play', 'fault', 'making', 'film', 'star', 'vehicle', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'script', 'integrity', ""O'Neill"", 'original', 'play', 'direction', 'imaginative', 'times', 'just', ""n't"", 'bring', 'drama', 'life', 'Mann', 'up', 'play', 'bit', 'sequences', 'still', 'have', 'static', 'quality', 'performances', 'range', 'decent', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'add', 'campy', 'quality', 'film', 'bring', 'out', 'soap', 'opera', 'elements', ""O'Neill"", 'plot', 'definitely', ""O'Neill"", 'play', 'reinterpretation', 'fact', 'fairly', 'minor', 'work', 'canon.Shot', 'Vistavision', 'one', 'earliest', 'widescreen', 'processes', 'black', 'white', 'images', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'sharper', 'better', 'clarity', 'was', 'sort', 'full', 'scale', 'restoration', 'done', 'film', 'Desire', 'decent', 'sequences', 'look', 'bit', 'muddy', 'other', 'parts', 'look', 'bit', 'washed', 'out', 'also', 'quite', 'bit', 'analog', 'blemishes', 'Given', 'age', 'film', 'black', 'white', 'images', 'look', 'pretty', 'decent', 'unlikely', 'Paramount', 'gave', 'producer', 'responsible', 'film-to-DVD', 'transfer', 'budget', 'necessary', 'restoration', 'film', 'sound', 'pretty', 'decent', 'frequency', 'response', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'could', 'be', 'Still', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'striking', 'score', 'good', 'presence', 'dialogue', 'fairly', 'are', 'extras', 'included', 'commentary', 'track.Although', 'not', 'complete', 'disaster', 'adaptation', ""O'Neill"", 'play', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'Basically', 'star', 'vehicle', 'Sophia', 'Loren', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'fine', 'moody', 'cinematography', 'director', 'Delbert', 'Mann', 'imaginative', 'direction', 'ca', ""n't"", 'overcome', 'script', 'piece', 'meal', 'approach', ""O'Neill"", 'play']",N/A
