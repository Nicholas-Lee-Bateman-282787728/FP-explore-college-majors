1119818,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B000YGGNM4,,"[0, 0]","Director Andy Fickman's ""The Game Plan"" is Disney through-in-through, so you can expect a happy ending, a lovable kid, a cute animal, and broad humor...but a terrific cast (headed by the surprisingly effective Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), lifts the film to a level where you don't have to have a kid to enjoy it!Johnson's acting skills improve with each film he's in, and he has a real gift for comedy, as a likable, if egotistical football superstar who suddenly finds himself parenting a daughter he never knew he had (Madison Pettis, in her film debut). Pettis is a handful (I personally thought she was more than a bit obnoxious, early in the film), but gradually, the pair discover that in learning to share in each other's lives, they become better persons. While some of the comic situations seem contrived, a genuine warmth develops that had me smiling, by the film's conclusion.A family comedy needs a great cast to 'work', and ""The Game Plan"" ensemble is exceptional, particularly Kyra Sedgwick, displaying a genuine comic flair, as Johnson's loyal (if calculating) agent, Morris Chestnut, his long-ignored wide receiver, Gordon Clapp, the plain-spoken coach, Paige Turco, as Pettis' understanding guardian, and Roselyn Sanchez (given an opportunity to display her remarkable dancing skills), as Pettis' sexy (if G-rated) dance instructor (the ballet sequences are very good, featuring the Boston Ballet in support). And, yes, Johnson's adorable dog is a scene-stealer, too!I got a big kick out of the ""I'm going to..."" gag, as it not only took a jab at McDonald's (under a different name, of course!), but Disney World, as well (Disney kidding Disney? Who'd have thought it...)""The Game Plan"", to everyone's surprise, was one of 2007's biggest hits, which tells you the film had an appeal far broader than just 'family' audiences, and if you haven't seen it yet, check it out...I believe you'll find it a most enjoyable 110 minutes!",4,"Warm, Funny, Better than you Expect!",1204070400,"02 27, 2008",2008,1942,"['Director', 'Andy', 'Fickman', 'Game', 'Plan', 'Disney', 'through-in-through', 'can', 'expect', 'happy', 'ending', 'lovable', 'kid', 'cute', 'animal', 'broad', 'humor', 'terrific', 'cast', 'headed', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'Dwayne', 'Rock', 'Johnson', 'film', 'level', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'have', 'kid', 'enjoy', 'Johnson', 'acting', 'skills', 'improve', 'film', 'real', 'gift', 'comedy', 'likable', 'egotistical', 'football', 'superstar', 'who', 'suddenly', 'parenting', 'daughter', 'never', 'knew', 'had', 'Madison', 'Pettis', 'film', 'debut', 'Pettis', 'handful', 'personally', 'thought', 'was', 'more', 'bit', 'obnoxious', 'early', 'film', 'gradually', 'pair', 'discover', 'learning', 'share', 'other', 'lives', 'become', 'better', 'persons', 'comic', 'situations', 'seem', 'contrived', 'genuine', 'warmth', 'had', 'smiling', 'film', 'conclusion.A', 'family', 'comedy', 'great', 'cast', ""'work"", 'Game', 'Plan', 'ensemble', 'exceptional', 'particularly', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'displaying', 'genuine', 'comic', 'flair', 'Johnson', 'loyal', 'calculating', 'agent', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'long-ignored', 'wide', 'receiver', 'Gordon', 'Clapp', 'plain-spoken', 'coach', 'Paige', 'Turco', 'Pettis', 'understanding', 'guardian', 'Roselyn', 'Sanchez', 'given', 'opportunity', 'display', 'remarkable', 'dancing', 'skills', 'Pettis', 'sexy', 'G-rated', 'dance', 'instructor', 'ballet', 'sequences', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'featuring', 'Boston', 'Ballet', 'support', 'yes', 'Johnson', 'adorable', 'dog', 'scene-stealer', 'too', 'got', 'big', 'kick', ""'m"", 'going', 'gag', 'not', 'only', 'took', 'jab', 'McDonald', 'different', 'name', 'course', 'Disney', 'World', 'as', 'well', 'Disney', 'kidding', 'Disney', 'Who', ""'d"", 'have', 'thought', 'Game', 'Plan', 'everyone', 'surprise', 'was', 'one', '2007', 'biggest', 'hits', 'film', 'had', 'appeal', 'far', 'broader', 'just', 'audiences', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'check', 'out', 'believe', ""'ll"", 'find', 'most', 'enjoyable', '110', 'minutes']",N/A

I certainly can't put it any better. Dwayne Johnson is in fact trying to expand his repertoire and he is good at it. Like Schwarzenegger I see his potential doing any genre. When Schwarzenegger did ""Twins"" it was obvious he wasn't just ""Conan the Barbarian"". As Steven pointed out Vin Diesel is another that has been expanding that acting envelope, so keep an eye on both of them. So after this you will definitely know Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson isn't just ""The Scorpion King"".This movie centers around an egotistical womanizing quarterback for Boston. When a young girl arrives at his penthouse apartment unescorted he doesn't know what to do about her when she says she is his daughter. Johnson soon finds out she is his daughter and is told she is there for a month visit while her mom assists a tribe in deep Africa. Johnson's character is slow to come around to the idea of raising a daughter with lots of comic moments defining those changes in his outlook. Overall a fun family movie from Disney. Well worth at least a rental and I recommend it as a buy for families. Good quality DVD with plenty of replayability. If you enjoyed this be sure to catch ""The Rundown"".

1119827,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000YGGNM4,,"[0, 1]","**1/2For even the most pumped-up action movie superstar, there's nothing like appearing in a family-friendly vehicle opposite a scene-stealing tyke to bring a touch of humanity to one`s image.  Indeed, such a career choice has become a virtual right-of-passage for these bodybuilder-turned-actor-types as they endeavor to diversify their portfolios and pad their resumes.  We've already had Arnold Schwarzenegger and Vin Diesel doing the daddy-day-care bit - in ""Kindergarten Cop"" and ""The Pacifier,"" respectively - and now we have Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson making like a wet-nurse in ""The Game Plan,"" a warm-and-fuzzy piece of generic fluff designed to be enjoyed and disposed of in roughly equal measure.Joe Kingman is a professional quarterback with an ego and a paycheck as massive as his ginormous biceps.  His free-swinging bachelor lifestyle consists of a swanky penthouse pad, endless parties, a stable of gorgeous women, and a Mercedes SLR McLaren worth a cool half a mill or so, give or take a few thou.  The problem is that Joe doesn't seem to realize just how lonely and empty his life really is until one fine day when an 8-year-old bundle-of-joy named Peyton shows up quite literally on his doorstep to inform him that she is the long-lost daughter he never knew he had.  Suddenly, this international playboy is thrust into the wholly alien world of ballet recitals, bubble baths and parental responsibility.Like the aforementioned movies that preceded it, ""The Game Plan"" is based on the premise that there is nothing quite so hilarious and aww-evoking as the sight of a steroid-pumped behemoth getting in touch with his nurturing nature.  Indeed, it's the incongruity between the macho faade and the tenderhearted actions that provides the comic tension necessary to make such stories work.  And ""The Game Plan"" certainly milks the formula for all it's worth.  The predictable storyline is made up of equal parts lowbrow slapstick and push-button sentimentality, as Joe ultimately sees the errors of his ways and becomes a much better man for his experience.Though no great shakes as an actor, Johnson has always displayed a certain self-deprecating charm on screen and he uses it to good effect here.  As the precocious moppet, Madison Pettis manages to keep the bathos and saccharine down to an acceptable minimum - which is more than can be said for the movie itself, actually, which ladles the syrup on pretty darn thick in the closing stretches.Nevertheless, this is, I suppose, a tolerable time-waster - provided you`re part of the right audience demographic for this kind of thing, that is.",2,so-so family comedy,1203206400,"02 17, 2008",2008,2613,"['**1/2For', 'even', 'most', 'pumped-up', 'action', 'movie', 'superstar', 'nothing', 'appearing', 'family-friendly', 'vehicle', 'scene-stealing', 'tyke', 'bring', 'touch', 'humanity', 'one', 's', 'image', 'Indeed', 'career', 'choice', 'become', 'virtual', 'right-of-passage', 'bodybuilder-turned-actor-types', 'endeavor', 'diversify', 'portfolios', 'pad', 'resumes', ""'ve"", 'already', 'had', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'doing', 'daddy-day-care', 'bit', 'Kindergarten', 'Cop', 'Pacifier', 'respectively', 'now', 'have', 'Dwayne', 'Rock', 'Johnson', 'making', 'wet-nurse', 'Game', 'Plan', 'warm-and-fuzzy', 'piece', 'generic', 'fluff', 'designed', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'disposed', 'roughly', 'equal', 'measure.Joe', 'Kingman', 'professional', 'quarterback', 'ego', 'paycheck', 'as', 'massive', 'ginormous', 'biceps', 'free-swinging', 'bachelor', 'lifestyle', 'swanky', 'penthouse', 'pad', 'endless', 'parties', 'stable', 'gorgeous', 'women', 'Mercedes', 'SLR', 'McLaren', 'cool', 'half', 'mill', 'so', 'give', 'take', 'few', 'thou', 'problem', 'Joe', ""n't"", 'seem', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'lonely', 'empty', 'life', 'really', 'one', 'fine', 'day', 'when', '8-year-old', 'bundle-of-joy', 'named', 'Peyton', 'up', 'quite', 'literally', 'doorstep', 'inform', 'long-lost', 'daughter', 'never', 'knew', 'had', 'Suddenly', 'international', 'playboy', 'thrust', 'wholly', 'alien', 'world', 'ballet', 'recitals', 'bubble', 'baths', 'parental', 'responsibility.Like', 'aforementioned', 'movies', 'preceded', 'Game', 'Plan', 'based', 'premise', 'nothing', 'quite', 'so', 'hilarious', 'aww-evoking', 'sight', 'steroid-pumped', 'behemoth', 'getting', 'touch', 'nurturing', 'nature', 'Indeed', 'incongruity', 'macho', 'faade', 'tenderhearted', 'actions', 'comic', 'tension', 'necessary', 'make', 'such', 'stories', 'work', 'Game', 'Plan', 'certainly', 'formula', 'worth', 'predictable', 'storyline', 'made', 'equal', 'parts', 'lowbrow', 'slapstick', 'push-button', 'sentimentality', 'Joe', 'ultimately', 'errors', 'ways', 'much', 'better', 'man', 'experience.Though', 'great', 'shakes', 'actor', 'Johnson', 'always', 'displayed', 'certain', 'self-deprecating', 'charm', 'screen', 'good', 'effect', 'here', 'precocious', 'moppet', 'Madison', 'Pettis', 'keep', 'bathos', 'saccharine', 'down', 'acceptable', 'minimum', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'movie', 'actually', 'syrup', 'pretty', 'darn', 'thick', 'closing', 'stretches.Nevertheless', 'suppose', 'tolerable', 'time-waster', 'provided', 're', 'part', 'right', 'audience', 'demographic', 'kind', 'thing']",N/A

1119834,A37MH7ICH80QOX,B000YGGNM4,Kate McMurry,"[0, 0]","Joe Kingman (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson of wrestling and football fame) is a famous quarterback and a swinging bachelor who lives in a luxurious apartment. His nickname isn't ""The King"" for nothing. He's convinced he's king of his world because he has everything he could possibly want out of life--until the day he discovers that for the past eight years he's been missing something he never knew he had. An adorable, precocious daughter named Peyton (Madison Pettis).This movie is extremely good at delivering what it promises--a film the whole family can enjoy together. It is clean enough for small children, but not such total pablum that it is utterly boring to adults, as so many children's movies are. Regarding the basically G-rated fare in the movie: I thought Disney was extremely creative in keeping it clean. For example, there is a scene early in the movie where ""The King"" is having a ""wild"" party. But no one smokes (cigarettes or anything else), no one is drunk or doing drugs, and there are no women in scanty clothing. In fact, speaking of women, there are no sex scenes of any kind. The King never kisses any female but his daughter. Not only that, his daughter wasn't the result of some fling with a sports groupie. She was conceived with his ex-wife right after their divorce when they were in their early 20s.Though plots with a ""secret baby"" and infantile dad have been done a lot--there is currently a similar plot device in the new TV series remake of the Ron Howard movie, Parenthood--there's a reason for that. It's fun to watch when it's done well. And this movie does it very well.I had never seen The Rock in a movie before this one, though I had heard of him. I was impressed with his performance. I've heard many actors say that it is far harder to do comedy well than drama, and The Rock is excellent at it. The child actress, Madison, does a very good job as well. She is not at all cloying and stilted as so many child actors are in family comedies. In addition, two supporting roles are particular standouts: Morris Chesnut is extremely appealing as The Rock's teammate who serves as a wonderful example of a family man and acts as an invaluable mentor to The King to help him grow into a loving father. Kyra Sedgwick also does a great job as The King's hard-nosed sports agent. She manages to act pushy and callous while being extremely funny at the same time.While there is a little bit of the inevitable gooey messes that go with children's movies (one scene involving a bubble bath gone awry and another with a blender sans lid), I am happy to report there are no food fights, no dogs destroy any property, and, in fact, no one utterly trashes The King's lovely apartment for the sake of laughs. The humor comes mostly from The Rock being a fish out of water as he tries to understand his daughter's needs and dreams and enters her world of ballet (The Rock in ballet tights is a real hoot), as well as very entertaining scenes of the little girl experiencing with her father his world of professional football.I think kids will love this movie, and I as an adult enjoyed it as well, even though my own kids are now grown and weren't home to enjoy it with me. It is funny throughout and the ending is very touching.",5,Funny and moving family entertainment,1269820800,"03 29, 2010",2010,3255,"['Joe', 'Kingman', 'Dwayne', 'Rock', 'Johnson', 'wrestling', 'football', 'fame', 'famous', 'quarterback', 'swinging', 'bachelor', 'who', 'luxurious', 'apartment', 'nickname', ""n't"", 'King', 'nothing', 'convinced', 'king', 'world', 'everything', 'could', 'possibly', 'want', 'life', 'day', 'past', 'eight', 'years', 'been', 'missing', 'something', 'never', 'knew', 'had', 'adorable', 'precocious', 'daughter', 'named', 'Peyton', 'Madison', 'Pettis', '.This', 'movie', 'extremely', 'good', 'delivering', 'what', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'together', 'clean', 'enough', 'small', 'children', 'not', 'such', 'total', 'pablum', 'utterly', 'boring', 'adults', 'so', 'many', 'children', 'movies', 'are', 'Regarding', 'basically', 'G-rated', 'fare', 'movie', 'thought', 'Disney', 'was', 'extremely', 'creative', 'keeping', 'clean', 'example', 'scene', 'early', 'movie', 'where', 'King', 'having', 'wild', 'party', 'one', 'cigarettes', 'anything', 'else', 'one', 'drunk', 'doing', 'drugs', 'are', 'women', 'scanty', 'clothing', 'fact', 'speaking', 'women', 'are', 'sex', 'scenes', 'kind', 'King', 'never', 'female', 'daughter', 'Not', 'only', 'daughter', 'was', ""n't"", 'result', 'fling', 'sports', 'groupie', 'was', 'conceived', 'ex-wife', 'right', 'divorce', 'when', 'were', 'early', '20s.Though', 'plots', 'secret', 'baby', 'infantile', 'dad', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'lot', 'currently', 'similar', 'plot', 'device', 'new', 'TV', 'series', 'remake', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'movie', 'Parenthood', 'reason', 'fun', 'watch', 'when', 'done', 'well', 'movie', 'very', 'well.I', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Rock', 'movie', 'one', 'had', 'heard', 'was', 'impressed', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'many', 'actors', 'say', 'far', 'harder', 'do', 'comedy', 'well', 'drama', 'Rock', 'excellent', 'child', 'actress', 'Madison', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'cloying', 'stilted', 'so', 'many', 'child', 'actors', 'are', 'family', 'comedies', 'addition', 'two', 'supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'particular', 'standouts', 'Morris', 'Chesnut', 'extremely', 'appealing', 'Rock', 'teammate', 'who', 'wonderful', 'example', 'family', 'man', 'invaluable', 'mentor', 'King', 'help', 'grow', 'loving', 'father', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'also', 'great', 'job', 'King', 'hard-nosed', 'sports', 'agent', 'act', 'pushy', 'callous', 'being', 'extremely', 'funny', 'same', 'time.While', 'little', 'bit', 'inevitable', 'gooey', 'messes', 'go', 'children', 'movies', 'one', 'scene', 'involving', 'bubble', 'bath', 'gone', 'awry', 'blender', 'lid', 'am', 'happy', 'report', 'are', 'food', 'fights', 'dogs', 'destroy', 'property', 'fact', 'one', 'utterly', 'King', 'lovely', 'apartment', 'sake', 'laughs', 'humor', 'mostly', 'Rock', 'being', 'fish', 'water', 'understand', 'daughter', 'needs', 'dreams', 'enters', 'world', 'ballet', 'Rock', 'ballet', 'tights', 'real', 'hoot', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'entertaining', 'scenes', 'little', 'girl', 'experiencing', 'father', 'world', 'professional', 'football.I', 'think', 'kids', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'adult', 'enjoyed', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'own', 'kids', 'are', 'now', 'grown', 'were', ""n't"", 'home', 'enjoy', 'funny', 'ending', 'very', 'touching']",N/A

A month before the big game, Joe gets the shock of his life; he has an eight year-old daughter named Peyton Kelly. At first, he is very reluctant to having her around because she's really hyper, but he soon grows to love her.
