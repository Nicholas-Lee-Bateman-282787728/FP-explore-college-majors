479745,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,6305812144,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[3, 3]","When I watch Full Moon High I feel grateful that Larry Cohen didn't decide to be a full time comedy film director.  Granted, most of his cult horror flicks like Q and The Stuff are satirical and have a bit of tongue in cheekiness, but it works in those films and you wouldn't consider them all out comedies.Full Moon High is an attempt to make a zany horror comedy in the Mel Brooks vein.  Hell, it even has Kenneth Mars.  Does it work?  yes and no, but mostly no.  I'd be lying if I said there weren't any laugh out loud moments, coz there certainly is.  But many jokes fall flat, and there seems to be too many gay jokes.  Cohen just seems to be trying way too hard to get laughs.  It's like he felt for his first actual comedy, he had to throw in everything but the kitchen sink, but didn't bother to put the reins on himself.In the film, Adam Arkin(Alan's son.  Alan himself makes an appearance and is one of the few funny things in the film) is a high school kid in the 50s.  He's a star on the football team and has a horny, gun toting, bomb shelter building father played by Ed McMahon.  On a trip to Romania, Arkin is bitten by a werewolf and is now under the curse.  Upon returning home he quits school right before the big game, and disappears to just wander around and stuff.  Not before he starts going around at night and biting(he doesn't kill anyone, he just bites them, usually on the butt.  Hardy Har Har.  And why do none of these people that he bites become werewolves themselves?) the townspeople and sending the community into a panic.  Twenty years later he's sick of his immortality and werewolf existence, so he returns to his hometown, goes back to high school and decides to win that big football game against the rival school that he missed out on back in the day.  He feels that this is his destiny and will somehow relieve him of the curse.That's pretty much it.  Like I said, it's really not a terrible movie by any means, but considering the cleverness and wit Cohen has put into other projects, it just seemed like a bit of a letdown is all.",3,Larry Cohen's Teen Wolf,1229817600,"12 21, 2008",2008,2073,"['When', 'watch', 'Full', 'Moon', 'High', 'feel', 'grateful', 'Larry', 'Cohen', 'did', ""n't"", 'decide', 'be', 'full', 'time', 'comedy', 'film', 'director', 'Granted', 'most', 'cult', 'horror', 'flicks', 'Q', 'Stuff', 'are', 'satirical', 'have', 'bit', 'tongue', 'cheekiness', 'films', 'would', ""n't"", 'consider', 'out', 'comedies.Full', 'Moon', 'High', 'attempt', 'make', 'zany', 'horror', 'comedy', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'vein', 'Hell', 'even', 'Kenneth', 'Mars', 'work', 'yes', 'mostly', ""'d"", 'be', 'lying', 'said', 'were', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'moments', 'coz', 'certainly', 'many', 'jokes', 'fall', 'flat', 'there', 'be', 'too', 'many', 'gay', 'jokes', 'Cohen', 'just', 'be', 'trying', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'get', 'laughs', 'felt', 'first', 'actual', 'comedy', 'had', 'throw', 'everything', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'put', 'reins', 'film', 'Adam', 'Arkin', 'Alan', 'son', 'Alan', 'appearance', 'one', 'few', 'funny', 'things', 'film', 'high', 'school', 'kid', '50s', 'star', 'football', 'team', 'horny', 'gun', 'toting', 'bomb', 'shelter', 'building', 'father', 'played', 'Ed', 'McMahon', 'trip', 'Romania', 'Arkin', 'bitten', 'werewolf', 'now', 'curse', 'returning', 'home', 'school', 'right', 'big', 'game', 'just', 'wander', 'around', 'stuff', 'Not', 'going', 'around', 'night', 'biting', ""n't"", 'kill', 'anyone', 'just', 'usually', 'butt', 'Hardy', 'Har', 'Har', 'why', 'do', 'none', 'people', 'become', 'werewolves', 'townspeople', 'sending', 'community', 'panic', 'Twenty', 'years', 'later', 'sick', 'immortality', 'werewolf', 'existence', 'hometown', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'decides', 'win', 'big', 'football', 'game', 'rival', 'school', 'missed', 'out', 'back', 'day', 'destiny', 'will', 'somehow', 'relieve', 'curse.That', 'pretty', 'much', 'said', 'really', 'not', 'terrible', 'movie', 'means', 'considering', 'cleverness', 'wit', 'Cohen', 'put', 'other', 'projects', 'just', 'seemed', 'bit', 'letdown']",Full Moon High VHS

It spoofs werewolf movies and asks the question, ""What is wrong being a werewolf if you don't kill anyone and become immortal?"" The nymphomaniac teacher, over sexed wife, girlish-son, hard nosed shrink, a gay football coach, John Bircher dad, over sexed vegetarian make for colorful characters in this wonderful well written comedy. The dry humor of Arkin delivering his lines in a dead-pan fashion added to the enjoyment. After being gone for 20 years Tony (Arkin) returns to find his old girlfriend married. She wants to be immortal with him, and wants to know if he could spend eternity with an ""older woman."" to wit Arkin replies, ""I don't know.
