We just got this today, and really had no great expectations, as our cat is generally not interested in any toys we've bought him.  Just recently got him a remote controlled mouse, but he was more interested in the remote in my hand than he was in the mouse...  But.  We are shocked.  Put the video in about a half an hour ago, and he's still there, in front of the TV.  Loved the birds, the crickets, and now he's talking to the squirrels!  Only wish we'd thought ahead and put the video in a room where we don't normally watch TV.  Afraid he'll be hogging the family room tv...  Anyway, buying another one for our daughter who has 3 cats!  Be sure, though, to secure your TV, and anything around it.  In the 1st 3 minutes, our cat knocked over some Wii controls we hadn't even thought of securing...",5,Awesome!,1391558400,"02 5, 2014",2014,833,"['Wish', ""'d"", 'bought', 'ages', 'ago', 'just', 'got', 'today', 'really', 'had', 'great', 'expectations', 'cat', 'generally', 'not', 'interested', 'toys', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'Just', 'recently', 'got', 'remote', 'controlled', 'mouse', 'was', 'more', 'interested', 'remote', 'hand', 'was', 'mouse', 'are', 'shocked', 'Put', 'video', 'half', 'hour', 'ago', 'still', 'there', 'front', 'TV', 'Loved', 'birds', 'crickets', 'now', 'talking', 'squirrels', 'Only', 'wish', ""'d"", 'thought', 'ahead', 'put', 'video', 'room', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'watch', 'TV', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hogging', 'family', 'room', 'tv', 'Anyway', 'buying', 'one', 'daughter', 'who', '3', 'cats', 'Be', 'sure', 'though', 'secure', 'TV', 'anything', '1st', '3', 'minutes', 'cat', 'knocked', 'Wii', 'had', ""n't"", 'even', 'thought', 'securing']",N/A

She is not used to watching the TV screen for these things, but I hope that she will warm up to it as time goes.  Sometimes the canned background music can be a little too much the same thing.  I will also add that although she is an indoor cat, we have a large house with many windows with big sills that she can perch on and watch the whole outdoors at her leisure.

1359308,A1HJ9P95IRZ32O,B003QTDI5G,"PMcOuntry ""PMcOuntry""","[0, 0]","This is my 2nd cat DVD, the last one (a different company) I have 4 starts to and 6 out of 8 gave it only one paw up... this ""mewvie"" gets four paws up! It's really more like 6 1/2 cats, as one is pretending not to like it, but I do catch him watching it, although not yet fully addicted like the other six. As I type this, one of them is staring at a blank TV screen right now, hoping I'll turn it on. As soon as they hear the TV come on, they come running. They paw it, bat it, bite it, look behind it, beside it, on top of it and everywhere else to see where that pesky squirrel could have gone, that bird flew to, or the chinchilla jumped to. They look at me with incredibly sad little faces when I turn it off, even if none of them are actually watching it! Watching them watch it is hysterical and makes me wonder about my sanity and the lack of having an actual life. If you read my review on the other DVD I bought for cats, you'll know why I start this TV for cat obsession in the first place, but I don't feel like repeating the entire long story here, suffice to say, the cat we intended it for, shows very little interest, but he is the one that I have caught watching it on the sly. Maybe I'll get him yet. Long story short, it's to try and keep him entertained more inside, so he'll stop attempting to get outside.Pros: Cats LOVE it. I have 6 little TV junkies now! The video loops over and over from bird to animal and back again. You can select where you want to start the video, on a bird, on an animal, your choice. NO FISH! The other video had fish and they yawned at the prospect of the fish and it had way too much of the fish. Thank you for NO FISH!Cons: The background noise is birds, always birds, there may be crickets on the screen or mice, but you still hear birds. Maybe this is to attract the cats to the TV, I have no idea, but I can mute it and they still like it. The bird sounds seem to be repetitive and get annoying after awhile and I love birds. However, the same ole same ole over and over and over... yeah, not so much.I've tried three cat videos so far, Happy Cat TV, this one and Mewvie Episode 2. I thought they would prefer Episode 2, because in my Happy Cat TV they loved the birds. Mewvie Episode 2 is all birds. The birds however are not very ""active"", they don't fly around enough as in the Happy Cat TV. I cannot return it as it's opened, so I may try and see if they will get interested in it yet, but so far the second one just hasn't been as interesting to them. If you can't decide which one to buy from this collection, I recommend Mewvie Episode 1 (this one) over Mewvie Episode 2.",5,6 out of 8 Cats  Give This DVD 4 Paws Up!,1370476800,"06 6, 2013",2013,2634,"['2nd', 'cat', 'DVD', 'last', 'one', 'different', 'company', 'have', '4', 'starts', '6', '8', 'gave', 'only', 'one', 'paw', 'up', 'mewvie', 'four', 'paws', 'up', 'really', 'more', '6', '1/2', 'cats', 'one', 'pretending', 'not', 'like', 'do', 'catch', 'watching', 'not', 'yet', 'fully', 'addicted', 'other', 'six', 'type', 'one', 'staring', 'blank', 'TV', 'screen', 'right', 'now', 'hoping', ""'ll"", 'turn', 'As', 'soon', 'hear', 'TV', 'come', 'come', 'running', 'paw', 'bite', 'look', 'top', 'everywhere', 'else', 'see', 'where', 'squirrel', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'bird', 'flew', 'chinchilla', 'jumped', 'look', 'incredibly', 'sad', 'little', 'when', 'turn', 'off', 'even', 'none', 'are', 'actually', 'watching', 'Watching', 'watch', 'hysterical', 'wonder', 'sanity', 'lack', 'having', 'actual', 'life', 'read', 'review', 'other', 'DVD', 'bought', 'cats', ""'ll"", 'know', 'why', 'start', 'TV', 'cat', 'obsession', 'first', 'place', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'repeating', 'entire', 'long', 'story', 'here', 'suffice', 'say', 'cat', 'intended', 'very', 'little', 'interest', 'one', 'have', 'caught', 'watching', 'sly', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'get', 'yet', 'Long', 'story', 'short', 'try', 'keep', 'entertained', 'more', 'inside', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'attempting', 'get', 'outside.Pros', 'Cats', 'LOVE', 'have', '6', 'little', 'TV', 'junkies', 'now', 'video', 'bird', 'animal', 'back', 'again', 'can', 'select', 'where', 'want', 'start', 'video', 'bird', 'animal', 'choice', 'FISH', 'other', 'video', 'had', 'fish', 'yawned', 'prospect', 'fish', 'had', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'fish', 'Thank', 'FISH', 'Cons', 'background', 'noise', 'birds', 'always', 'birds', 'may', 'be', 'crickets', 'screen', 'mice', 'still', 'hear', 'birds', 'Maybe', 'attract', 'cats', 'TV', 'have', 'idea', 'can', 'mute', 'still', 'bird', 'seem', 'be', 'repetitive', 'get', 'annoying', 'awhile', 'love', 'birds', 'However', 'same', 'ole', 'same', 'ole', 'yeah', 'not', 'so', 'much.I', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'three', 'cat', 'videos', 'so', 'far', 'Happy', 'Cat', 'TV', 'one', 'Mewvie', 'Episode', '2', 'thought', 'would', 'prefer', 'Episode', '2', 'Happy', 'Cat', 'TV', 'loved', 'birds', 'Mewvie', 'Episode', '2', 'birds', 'birds', 'however', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'active', 'do', ""n't"", 'fly', 'around', 'enough', 'Happy', 'Cat', 'TV', 'can', 'not', 'return', 'opened', 'may', 'try', 'see', 'will', 'get', 'interested', 'yet', 'so', 'far', 'second', 'one', 'just', ""n't"", 'been', 'interesting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'one', 'buy', 'collection', 'recommend', 'Mewvie', 'Episode', '1', 'one', 'Mewvie', 'Episode', '2']",N/A
