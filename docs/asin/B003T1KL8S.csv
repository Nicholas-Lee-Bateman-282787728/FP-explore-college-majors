But I am a fan of comedies with dysfunctional, weird characters or odd occurrences. This is a movie of people that are truly unhinged, odd , artistic in a amusing /entertaining in a interesting way. If you are not a intelligent person and don't catch on to dry humor ? Please do not waste your time on this you will be confused and bored. I love this movie I laughed until I couldn't laugh anymore this was so hilarious to me ! All of these people had terrible taste and bad judgment and they took there art and themselves way to seriously. If you like Punch drunk love, Or Very Bad things or Hard Candy ?

It is a hilarious send-up of the pretensions of the contemporary Art and Classical Music scenes.  Knowledgeable viewers will have a field day identifying the delightful parodies of the work of several famous visual artists and composers, while everyone else will embrace this indulgent and warm-hearted portrait of a group of people whose only sin is that of taking themselves a bit too seriously.  The splendid (and occasionally quite deliberately ridiculous!) music is provided by the fine American composer David Lang, who is best known for his work with the successful Bang On a Can ensemble.  Lang was awarded the 2008 Pulitzer Prize in music for his choral piece The Little Match Girl Passion.  I think you will all like this little movie.

1361842,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003T1KL8S,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[3, 3]","The crisp satire ""(Untitled)"" is a smart and savage skewering of the art world where taste is dictated by hype and collectable value as opposed to passion or merit.  If you've ever been to a perplexing gallery show, one that challenges the conventions of recognizable art, you're likely to delight in the absolutely ridiculously (but sadly believable) exhibits within the film.  Combined with some equally obnoxious performance art, this is as spot-on in its mockery as you're likely to see!  Appropriately populated with an elitism and an air of intellectual superiority, ""(Untitled)"" absolutely benefits from its incisive screenplay, talented cast, and a specific viewpoint targeting the criticisms inherent in the contemporary art scene.  If you are fascinated by this world, knowledgeable about the state of modern art, or participate as a viewer or collector--this film is an easy recommendation.  It has an insider's appeal that is undeniable.  However, even if you know little about the topic, the film still boasts an outrageousness you may appreciate.The film is headlined by an inspired Marley Shelton.  I have been familiar with Shelton's work, but she has never been particularly vivid for me.  Here, though, she shines with much sexiness and great comedic timing as a ritzy gallerist torn between two brothers.  She represents one brother as a commercial venture, selling his paintings to institutional settings.  His work, all variations of the same abstract theme, is not avant garde enough for a place in her gallery--but it sure does pay the bills!  She is intrigued by his aloof sibling, Adam Goldberg, a rather unpleasant sound artist.  Goldberg's work generally produces a riotous cacophony of noise which Shelton finds appealing.  They are kindred souls as both have an emotional disconnectedness as well as a skewed vision of what constitutes art.  This romance, such as it is, is a uniting of narcissists.The film features a couple of very funny supporting roles--Zak Orth as a trendy collector with more money than sense and Vinnie Jones as an artist dealing in dead animals.  ""(Untitled)"" starts out really strong--as I identified with its absurdity, I absolutely fell in love with the film.  It may, however, go on a beat too long.  The story suffers slightly in comparison to the set-up.  As none of the characters are particularly likable, their personal lives and entanglements were far less interesting to me than the satiric elements in the film.  But Shelton, in particular, keeps us on track and the end of her story is far more involving than anything the brothers have cooked up.  A solid comedy, with elements of greatness, ""(Untitled)"" may not be perfect--but it's a very adept and pointed look that challenges the notion of what represents art.

The art is question is music/performance art and visual art (paintings, sculpures and other objects if one can call them that).  Most of the actors in this film are unknown (to me), but their performances are fantastic.  From start to finish one has to wonder are these people for real, or are they going through life faking it.In any case, film digs into questions of today's state of the contemporary art.  What is art?  Who is the true artist - the one who can actually support himself by selling his paintings while not being recognised by any of the major art museums, or the artist whose work is bought by clueless rich people trying to make themselves look sophisticated by collecting trash and displaying it in their huge lofts?

1361847,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B003T1KL8S,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Untitled (Jonathan Parker, 2009)I remember seeing trailers for this back before it originally came out, and seeing some critical buzz attached to it, but then never actually got round to seeing it until Netflix told me it was going to pop off my queue at midnight if I didn't sit down and actually watch it. Part of the problem was that nothing I heard about the movie back then really excited me; it just seemed like yet another indie rom-com. Ten minutes into the movie, I realized I had been misled. Untitled is, in fact, an indie rom-com, but there is nothing at all ""yet"" about it. I will say that as someone who's been immersed in this world for fifteen years as a participant, and decades longer as a fan, I probably found it a whole lot funnier than many people will, but that's no reason not to see it.Adrian Jacobs (The Salton Sea's Adam Goldberg) is a classically-trained pianist who, along with the other members of his ensemble (played by Hitch's Ptolemy Slocum and Hot Fuzz' Lucy Punch), creates dissonant, inaccessible sound pieces during performances attended by almost no one. Madeleine (Pleasantville's Marley Shelton) is a Soho gallery owner who caters to the whims of ultra-rich art collector Porter Canby (Vicky Cristina Barcelona's Zak Orth) while trying to woo London-based artist Ray Barko (The Midnight Meat Train's Vinnie Jones) into signing an exclusive contract with her. The two come into contact when Madeleine, who is dating Adrian's brother Josh (Fight Club's Eion Bailey) as the film opens, attends on of his performances. She invites his ensemble to perform at a Ray Barko opening at her gallery, where Porter Canby hears them--and commissions a piece for $25,000, which may be more than Adrian has made in his entire career. Incidentally, the two of them fall in love, while trying to keep that a secret from Josh.Why did I find this movie hilarious? Because I know these people, every one of them, most of them intimately. This despite the obvious influences (Adrian is based on Morton Feldman, and Parker--who also co-wrote the script--adds a delightful bit of meta by having Adrian attend a performance in celebration of ""Morton Cabot""'s 90th birthday, and ends up sitting next to Cabot himself [played by Jagged Edge's Ben Hammer], who offers Adrian some sage advice at a critical time in his life; Ray Barko is, equally obviously, a caricature of Damien Hirst); in fact, were Parker based in Cleveland, there's one scene featuring Ptolemy Slocum's character where I'd have bet money Parker actually based him on... me. (For trivia purposes: when he's practicing for the Canby piece, kicking the bucket over... and over... and over...) Parker gets it, and he's savvy enough to poke fun at modern art and the scene surrounding it without ever disclosing whether he's laughing at his characters or with them, not that most of these humorless fools have much of a sense of humor. A lot of people commenting on the IMDB boards about the movie are convinced Parker is simply lampooning the scene, but he's depicted it too well to just be someone on the outside looking in. (Catch a few news stories about your favorite ""fringe"" scene, and compare them to the job Parker does here, and you'll see what I mean.)This is a fun, fun movie, and I recommend it highly. ****",4,"This ain't a scene, it's an arms race",1354492800,"12 3, 2012",2012,3300,"['Untitled', 'Jonathan', 'Parker', '2009', 'remember', 'seeing', 'trailers', 'back', 'originally', 'came', 'out', 'seeing', 'critical', 'buzz', 'attached', 'then', 'never', 'actually', 'got', 'round', 'seeing', 'Netflix', 'told', 'was', 'going', 'pop', 'off', 'queue', 'midnight', 'did', ""n't"", 'sit', 'down', 'actually', 'watch', 'Part', 'problem', 'was', 'nothing', 'heard', 'movie', 'back', 'then', 'really', 'excited', 'just', 'seemed', 'like', 'yet', 'indie', 'rom-com', 'Ten', 'minutes', 'movie', 'realized', 'had', 'been', 'misled', 'Untitled', 'fact', 'indie', 'rom-com', 'nothing', 'yet', 'will', 'say', 'someone', 'who', 'been', 'immersed', 'world', 'fifteen', 'years', 'participant', 'decades', 'longer', 'fan', 'probably', 'found', 'whole', 'lot', 'funnier', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'reason', 'not', 'see', 'it.Adrian', 'Jacobs', 'Salton', 'Sea', 'Adam', 'Goldberg', 'classically-trained', 'pianist', 'who', 'other', 'members', 'ensemble', 'played', 'Hitch', 'Ptolemy', 'Slocum', 'Hot', 'Fuzz', 'Lucy', 'Punch', 'dissonant', 'inaccessible', 'sound', 'pieces', 'performances', 'attended', 'almost', 'one', 'Madeleine', 'Pleasantville', 'Marley', 'Shelton', 'Soho', 'gallery', 'owner', 'who', 'whims', 'ultra-rich', 'art', 'collector', 'Porter', 'Canby', 'Vicky', 'Cristina', 'Barcelona', 'Zak', 'Orth', 'trying', 'woo', 'London-based', 'artist', 'Ray', 'Barko', 'Midnight', 'Meat', 'Train', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'signing', 'exclusive', 'contract', 'two', 'come', 'contact', 'when', 'Madeleine', 'who', 'dating', 'Adrian', 'brother', 'Josh', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Eion', 'Bailey', 'film', 'performances', 'ensemble', 'perform', 'Ray', 'Barko', 'opening', 'gallery', 'where', 'Porter', 'Canby', 'commissions', 'piece', '25,000', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'Adrian', 'made', 'entire', 'career', 'Incidentally', 'two', 'fall', 'love', 'trying', 'keep', 'secret', 'Josh.Why', 'did', 'find', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'know', 'people', 'one', 'most', 'intimately', 'obvious', 'influences', 'Adrian', 'based', 'Morton', 'Feldman', 'Parker', 'who', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'script', 'delightful', 'bit', 'meta', 'having', 'Adrian', 'attend', 'performance', 'celebration', 'Morton', 'Cabot', '90th', 'birthday', 'up', 'sitting', 'next', 'Cabot', '[', 'played', 'Jagged', 'Edge', 'Ben', 'Hammer', ']', 'who', 'Adrian', 'sage', 'advice', 'critical', 'time', 'life', 'Ray', 'Barko', 'equally', 'obviously', 'caricature', 'Damien', 'Hirst', 'fact', 'were', 'Parker', 'based', 'Cleveland', 'one', 'scene', 'featuring', 'Ptolemy', 'Slocum', 'character', 'where', ""'d"", 'have', 'bet', 'money', 'Parker', 'actually', 'based', 'trivia', 'purposes', 'when', 'practicing', 'Canby', 'piece', 'kicking', 'bucket', 'Parker', 'savvy', 'enough', 'poke', 'fun', 'modern', 'art', 'scene', 'surrounding', 'ever', 'disclosing', 'laughing', 'characters', 'not', 'most', 'humorless', 'fools', 'have', 'much', 'sense', 'humor', 'lot', 'people', 'commenting', 'IMDB', 'boards', 'movie', 'are', 'convinced', 'Parker', 'simply', 'lampooning', 'scene', 'depicted', 'too', 'well', 'just', 'be', 'someone', 'outside', 'looking', 'Catch', 'few', 'news', 'stories', 'favorite', 'fringe', 'scene', 'compare', 'job', 'Parker', 'here', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'fun', 'fun', 'movie', 'recommend', 'highly', '****']",Untitled
