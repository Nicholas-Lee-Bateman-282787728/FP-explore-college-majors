This having been a massively popular stage play of great renown, well, I figured I'd give it a try.So much for that idea.  The dimwits behind this production decided to drop the ""Fantasicks"" traveling carnival troupe into the middle of nowhere, literally, with no town in sight.  The only humans within miles, apparently, are two single fathers and their teenage kids (one boy, one girl, one per father) who live next door in this prairieland and share a fence and feud over it.  What, they couldn't move a few miles apart?And these are just the impenetrable bits of ludricous nonsense that occur within the opening credits.  Then there's the direction and cinematography, which could basically be easily mistaken for a third-rate cable movie of the week.  Bleah.The only ""fantastick"" thing about this flick is that its current rating by Amazon users is three stars.  Are the cast and crew stuffing the ballot box?

569615,A3QIW6ULPIPM2V,B000056KE9,Chip Kaufmann,"[26, 27]","Over the course of my 20 year theatrical ""career"" I appeared in three different productions of THE FANTASTICKS. First in high school, then in community theatre, and finally in a professional theatre. Each time I played the same role of Mortimer, the man who dies (that's because I couldn't sing but I did die rather well). Imagine my indignation when I discovered that he was all but eliminated in this film version of the long running musical along with Henry, the old actor. As played by Teller (of Penn & Teller) and Barnard Hughes this constitutes a criminal offense on the part of Francis Ford Coppola who was responsible for re-editing the original film five years after it was finished. But that's only the beginning. He also shortened or removed several of the play's signature tunes (TRY TO REMEMBER, PLANT A RADISH) as well as key scenes including the one with the cardboard moon which states the central point of the play which is ""to see it not with your eyes for they are wise but with your ears"". Why this was done is hard to fathom as it not only minimizes the storyline but reduces the musical moments as well. Fortunately the DVD has all this missing material (as bonus features) which allows you to reconstruct the film as it was and should have been released. Despite the hatchet job in the editing room there is still a lot to recommend. The play had to be opened up from its humble stage origins and this was done by giving it an OKLAHOMA like setting (it was shot in the same location) and by making El Gallo the head of a mysterious traveling carnival. The performances by the entire cast are not overpowering but they are not meant to be and they fit the characters just fine. Remember THE FANTASTICKS was created as a sort of anti-musical in reaction to the large scale Rodgers & Hammerstein musicals of the day and with an eye to amateur performances. The cinematography is lovely, the updated script by original creators Tom Jones & Harvey Schmidt works well and despite the misguided efforts of Coppola there is still the simple, memorable music that retains the power to grab you if you ""see it with your ears"". So in the end I was pleased with the film overall with the 5 star musical getting a 4 star treatment minus a star for the horrendous editing. If you love THE FANTASTICKS (or old fashioned musicals in general) then this DVD is certainly worth having and maybe one day the film will be released as originally shot so that we don't have to play the King's men and try and put Humpty Dumpty together again.

Is it any good? Well, yes and no.The plot concerns the machinations of two next door neighbors who pretend to have a feud in the hopes that their children will fall in love (the lure forbidden fruit and all that). They enlist the help of a strange traveling circus to aid them in their plan. The first half of the movie is quite decent and somewhat sweet, and I enjoyed it very much. And then, for some reason, the movie completely derails, gets flat out bizarre (and earns its PG rating) before ending on a weird note.If you are a die-hard fan of the original musical you will probably hate this movie, because the music has been basically butchered. The performances range from good (Joel Grey) to lame (Joe McIntyre) to inexplicable (Vegas magician Teller). But then there is Jonathan Morris. I've never seen him in anything else, but he has an incredible, mesmerizing presence. The script changes his character completely halfway through the film, which is annoying, but his performance continues to stay with me, especially his gentle rendition of ""Try to Remember"" (which, despite being the most famous song in the musical, is given about one minute of screen time. Grrr.). He made the movie worth seeing (once) for me, but all others beware.It's really too bad; there was great potential here but the filmmakers muffed it. Maybe they'll try again someday, but until then you can check out the original Broadway soundtrack to see what all the fuss was about in the first place. I give this film version 2.5 stars, which I rounded down to two.

The cast, for the most part are fine, especially Joel Grey, Barnard Hughs and Teller.  However, it never quite jells into a magical whole.  Part of that may be due to the fact that the show itself is SO dependant on the stagecraft that helped set the tone.  A lot of it has to due with the editing that leaves some very strange choices: the reduction of the hit &quot;Try to Remember&quot; into little more than a wrap-up number at film's end, El Gallo's role as narrarator basically being eliminated, and the fact that Broadway pro Joel Grey is partnered with an actor who can barely carry a tune.  All of these things plus more add up to a rather lame version of a great play.

569622,A1XSXUBCNFIM3W,B000056KE9,Jim Jr,"[2, 3]","After eagerly awating the arrival of the DVD of one of my favorite musicals, I have very mixed emotions about it. I wish I could give it 5 stars, but have to deduct one because of the horrible cutting job done to it. Evidently the director and producers are unaware that there a great number of fans who know the songs and dialogue word for word. Some of the cuts are unbelievable. The ""hit"" song, ""Try To Remember"" become a very short version at the very end of the film. Since the whole idea of the show is to remeber emotions and situations, cutting this number really hurts the whole film. (Luckily the full version is on the bonus features of the DVD)One of the biggest clues to the character of El Gallo - the narrator and driving force of the piece - comes at the end of the speech beginning: ""There is a curious paradox that no one can explain --""(just prior to the song ""They Were You"") The final lines of the speech are cut (""I hurt them for that reason, and myself a little bit too."") they made the character a bit more human. It is really a beautifully poetic speech and one of my favorites in the show.The ""Old Actor"" and his sidekick, Mortimer, have some of their best scenes cut (again, thanks to the DVD special features, they can still be seen, even though out of context). Teller, who is the usually silent member of the team of Penn and Teller actually speaks in these scenes, but you will only see them in the ""special features"".One real plus for the DVD is that the original ""Rape"" number is included. This is the one that was in the show when it opened 40 years ago and has now been rewritten because of today's standards. Even though it is explained that ""rape"" is used with the old meaning of ""abduction"" not the sexual violation of today, people object to the original very funny number. To have it is a definite plus for the DVD.In the theater, ""Fantasticks"" is presented very simply on a small platorm with no elaborate scenery. This could not work in a film. The idea of setting parts of the story in a traveling carnival is a good one and works surprisingly well. The whole film has an other world, fantasy feeling that is right for the story. (The carvnival is reminiscent of the one in ""Somthing Wicked This Way Comes"".) It is probably the only way this musical could have worked as a film.The performances, with one exception, are excellent. Joel Gray is wonderful as one of the fathers. Contrast this performance with the emcee in ""Cabaret"" and you will see just how talented this man is. The one exception is a very miscast Jonathon Morris as El Gallo. The part calls for a strong singer and larger than life personality, Morris has a barely adequare singing voice and no charisma to speak of and his English accent is out of place.

However, once in awhile, we are treated to an exceptional musical. A few come to mind: West Side Story 1961, The Music Man (1962), My Fair Lady (1964), Sound Of Music (1965), Oliver! (1968), The Boy Friend (1971), Fiddler On The Roof (1971), Cabaret 1972, Pennies From Heaven (1981), Moulin Rouge (2001), Chicago (2002) and The Phantom Of The Opera (2004). I'd like to add The Fantasticks (1995) to this list. It is visually stunning, it sounds great and has a magical quality that is absorbing and mesmerizing. I believe it is not meant for everyone, but that is very true of each and every musical listed here. I am drawn to this film and find it more rewarding and appealing with each viewing. It is true that the show's most popular song, Try To Remember is abbreviated, but it is beautifully done and there is an alternate version and a deleted version available on the disc. This was also a complaint in A Chorus Line (1985) with it's most popular song, What I Did For Love. Perhaps the powers that be, felt that these popular songs would date the films. In any event, if you love musicals, I think you will find much to cherish with The Fantasticks.(By the way, A Chorus Line is another enjoyable musical, but the film suffers by mis-casting Michael Douglas and then diverting too much attention with his relationship with the Cassie character).

569627,A1RPTVW5VEOSI,B000056KE9,Michael J. Edelman,"[5, 5]","There is much to admire in this attempt to bring The Fantasticks to the screen. The photography is absolutely beautiful, for one. I'm reminded of the magical, story book images that characterized the best of the movie musicals, like &quot;Oaklahoma!&quot;. The story is presented in an imaginative way, too; after all, you can't really take a play staged on a small wooden platform in small halls and just film it. You don't have the intimacy once it's on the screen. So I give it high points for the imaginative staging.And most of the cast is good, too, with one exception- Jonathon Morris' El Gallo. Now Morris is a good actor, and he brings some good qualities to the dramatic aspects of this role, but he's a relatively weak singer. If you've ever heard Jerry Orbach in the original Broadway cast recording, you know how a the role should be sung. Orbach's El Gallo is a commanding figure, taking center stage. Morris is almost peripheral. It works, after a fashion, but it's weak.I'm also not crazy about the decision to put &quot;Try To Remember&quot; at the end, rather than the beginning, of the movie. I suppose there's an argument to be made that it works well enough there, but it served a critical function at the opening of the play. When El Gallo comes out at the opening of the theatrical show and sings &quot;Try To Remember&quot; he's setting the stage for what's to follow. He's telling the audience to get a a particular frame of mind, to forget the way the world is and to imagine a time in the past, perhaps the imaginary past, a time when things were simpler and more innocent.It's also important that El Gallo is in the center of an empty stage when he sings this. He's telling the audience to listen- there's something important they need to pay attention to. But when Morris sings this at the end of the movie, the camera is panning over the caravan, occasionally pausing to show miller, whose attention isn't so much on the song or the message as it is on the road ahead. Without its context, the most powerful song in the show becomes merely incidental trailer music. It's a mere footnote.So: As a movie musical, not too bad. I've seen far worse.  Cinematography, five stars. It's beautifully filmed.

I much prefer no circus, leaving El Gallo's persona to the imagination, rather than having him be some literal creature of human form.  I see him as nature overlooking the callow, helping to mature natural naivete.  And who on earth cast the actor in the role of El Gallo?  He is weak vocally and not nearly handsome enough to attract Luisa.  He might just as well have been Matt as El Gallo.  Joel Grey, who is given top billing, likely because of the fame he garnered after his brilliant portrayal of the MC in &#34;Cabaret,&#34; provides a lackluster, very disappointing portrayal of the girl's father.  The rest of the cast is more than satisfactory, in particular, &#34;the girl.&#34;  Songs are deleted too.  Fortunately, they can be viewed in the specials after the movie finishes.

569635,ADK5CSMBXHIL8,B000056KE9,"T. Halkin ""Tim""","[2, 3]","There is a reason why this show is still playing off-Broadway after over 30 years - it's just down-right brilliant. What makes the show work so well is it's intimacy, but it's intimacy only works when it's scaled for a small audience. Try and make this bigger, and it suddenly becomes pale, even silly at times. I was horrified to hear that an attempt was made to film this, and glad it was shelved for 5 years. Unfortunately, it has now been released, after being re-edited. Don't get me wrong - the cast is more than respectable; even NKOTB-ex, Joseph Mulrey McIntyre is sweet as Matt. Jonathon Morris as El Gallo is also a wonderful piece of casting, not to mention Joel Grey and Bernard Hughes as the feuding parents. Even the settings are wonderful, but at the end of the day, the magic of this show is created in a 300 seat theatre with 2 pianos and a harp...anything more is less. To add insult to injury, someone obviously got cold feet about the song &quot;Rape&quot;, and exchanged one of the show's highlights for a banal ditty. If you don't know &quot;The Fantasticks&quot;, please don't watch this film, because it will make you hate the musical.

Transposing The Fantastiks to a realistic setting was a huge mistake and robs the audience of it's imagination, which is the key to The Fantastiks success.

So...I went out, bought a DVD player and purchased this as my first ever DVD disc. What a difference!! The deleted songs, scenes, full song versions, and director's voice-over of the entire film is worth the price of the player alone! We catch a glimpse of what might have been had someone other than Coppola (who I WORSHIP!!)had gotten their hands on the editing scissors. The DVD extras restore much of the magic, delicacy, and strength of this classic. While on the VHS, I didn't warm up to the actor playing El Gallo til the 2nd act, in the deleted songs and scenes on the DVD, I saw all of the facets I was missing.We actually see where TRY TO REMEMBER was initially supposed to be introduced. We learn of the location, weather conditions, live singing, etc. There is a three-time recurring policeman role which creates a past-present-future thread to the traveling carnival's purpose. Ritchie truly attempted to preserve the original other-worldliness of this story, and the DVD gives a much clearer glimpse of his very near miss at success. I would love to see the original, flawed film as Ritchie conceived it.P.S. I recently loaned this to a friend who played Matt in the Sullivan Street production many years ago, and he felt the DVD was lovely, charming and captured the essence of the original.

569639,A3QAYLBOWJVDO4,B000056KE9,"William Olson ""cinephile""","[1, 1]","I love the original Off-Broadway stage production.  I saw it in 1972 when I was 16.  The film could have been so much better.  As it is, it's OK.  Granted, this is a musical that weaves it magic on the stage where imagination and intimacy are part of the show.  That being said, this film is a mixed bag.  I like the girl a lot.  The boy...not so much.  Joel Grey is fine but the actor playing the boy's father seems all wrong for the part.  Barnard Hughes and Teller are perfectly cast.  The choice for El Gallo is peculiar.  Sounding a lot like Peter O'Toole, his perfomance is hit and miss.  The film LOOKS great with an intelligent use of magic hour light.  The orchestrations by that genius, Jonathan Tunick  are, quite simply, brilliant!  The first time I saw the film, the opening title sequence began and within moments I said to myself ""That sounds like Jonathan Tunick's orchestrations.""  About 30 seconds later, the credit appeared on the screen, ""Orchestrations by Jonathan Tunick"".  Amazing!  Taking a beautiful score originally performed by piano and harp, it fully blossoms with his lush romantic musical sensibilities.  Thank you so much, Mr. Tunick.",3,Mixed Bag,1272412800,"04 28, 2010",2010,1166,"['love', 'original', 'Off-Broadway', 'stage', 'production', 'saw', '1972', 'when', 'was', '16', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'OK.', 'Granted', 'musical', 'stage', 'where', 'imagination', 'intimacy', 'are', 'part', 'show', 'being', 'said', 'film', 'mixed', 'bag', 'girl', 'lot', 'boy', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Joel', 'Grey', 'fine', 'actor', 'playing', 'boy', 'father', 'wrong', 'part', 'Barnard', 'Hughes', 'Teller', 'are', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'choice', 'El', 'Gallo', 'peculiar', 'Sounding', 'lot', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'perfomance', 'hit', 'film', 'LOOKS', 'great', 'intelligent', 'use', 'magic', 'hour', 'light', 'orchestrations', 'genius', 'Jonathan', 'Tunick', 'are', 'quite', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'film', 'opening', 'title', 'sequence', 'began', 'moments', 'said', 'myself', 'Jonathan', 'Tunick', 'orchestrations', '30', 'seconds', 'later', 'credit', 'appeared', 'screen', 'Orchestrations', 'Jonathan', 'Tunick', 'Amazing', 'Taking', 'beautiful', 'score', 'originally', 'performed', 'piano', 'harp', 'fully', 'lush', 'romantic', 'musical', 'sensibilities', 'Thank', 'so', 'much', 'Mr.', 'Tunick']",N/A
