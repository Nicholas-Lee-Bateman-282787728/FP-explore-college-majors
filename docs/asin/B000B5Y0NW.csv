I enjoy all music and have dvd concerts from every genre and spanning the 70's to current. Hands down this in in top 3, for quality and clarity. You would think you are there. So many dvd's the music is great but the vocals are hard to hear.Balance is hands down the best. So many are over dubbed, and if they did they hid it well. I watched for all the usual spots and I don't belive its over dubbed at all. Was it remastered and cleaned up, probably. But this was when artist carred most about their craft and this show proves it.I am 40 and was never able to see him live. I have loved his music and personal story since my late teens. I will say, when it started my emotions got the best of me, it felt like I was getting to see a gem that was so very close to never being shared with the world.PS, Yusuf(we are on a first name basis now) Thank you for allowing this to be released to the world and sharing your musical genius with us.",5,What can I say - everyone is right,1397520000,"04 15, 2014",2014,1045,"['wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'long', 'review', 'here', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'already', 'said', 'everything', 'Just', 'awesome', 'dvd', 'enjoy', 'music', 'have', 'dvd', 'concerts', 'genre', 'spanning', '70', 'current', 'down', 'top', '3', 'quality', 'clarity', 'would', 'think', 'are', 'there', 'So', 'many', 'dvd', 'music', 'great', 'vocals', 'are', 'hard', 'hear.Balance', 'hands', 'down', 'best', 'So', 'many', 'are', 'dubbed', 'did', 'hid', 'well', 'watched', 'usual', 'spots', 'do', ""n't"", 'belive', 'dubbed', 'Was', 'remastered', 'cleaned', 'up', 'probably', 'was', 'when', 'artist', 'carred', 'most', 'craft', 'show', 'it.I', 'am', '40', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'see', 'live', 'have', 'loved', 'music', 'personal', 'story', 'late', 'teens', 'will', 'say', 'when', 'started', 'emotions', 'got', 'best', 'felt', 'was', 'getting', 'see', 'gem', 'was', 'so', 'very', 'close', 'never', 'being', 'shared', 'world.PS', 'Yusuf', 'are', 'first', 'name', 'basis', 'now', 'Thank', 'allowing', 'be', 'released', 'world', 'sharing', 'musical', 'genius']",N/A

The video is great as well, but what I am impressed with is the truly excellent sound. Today's recordings of live concerts are often not as good, and there is far superior equipment to work with. Use of mixing to allow for crowd reaction at the right times, yet eliminate unwanted extraneous noise is incredibly well done. One review I read elsewhere had a quibble about the fact that Cat seemed to be a bit irritable about a couple of things which went on that night, but he had good reason, and I did not feel he went over the line when his reaction to someone taping his mic stand improperly was a bit negative, I probably would have done the same. If there was any disappointment with this DVD at all, for me, it would have been that I felt maybe a couple more songs should have been included, not only adding to the length, but I felt he had some others by that time which belonged in any concert he would have done. Those MAY have been edited out either for time or quality, I have no way of knowing.",5,Best live DVD production I have heard,1308614400,"06 21, 2011",2011,1126,"['am', 'pretty', 'amazed', 'DVD', 'Considering', 'was', 'made', 'original', '1976', 'film', 'recordings', 'sound', 'fantastic', 'video', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'am', 'impressed', 'truly', 'excellent', 'sound', 'Today', 'recordings', 'live', 'concerts', 'are', 'often', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'far', 'superior', 'equipment', 'work', 'Use', 'mixing', 'allow', 'crowd', 'reaction', 'right', 'times', 'yet', 'eliminate', 'unwanted', 'extraneous', 'noise', 'incredibly', 'well', 'done', 'One', 'review', 'read', 'elsewhere', 'had', 'quibble', 'fact', 'Cat', 'seemed', 'be', 'bit', 'irritable', 'couple', 'things', 'went', 'night', 'had', 'good', 'reason', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'went', 'line', 'when', 'reaction', 'someone', 'taping', 'mic', 'stand', 'improperly', 'was', 'bit', 'negative', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'same', 'was', 'disappointment', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'felt', 'maybe', 'couple', 'more', 'songs', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'not', 'only', 'adding', 'length', 'felt', 'had', 'others', 'time', 'belonged', 'concert', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'MAY', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'out', 'time', 'quality', 'have', 'way', 'knowing']",N/A

Cat and company were touring in support of his Numbers album. This was his last major tour before his nearly 30 year layoff. The performances are top notch and the picture/sound quality are amazing. I wish all concert releases look and sounded this good. There are also recent interviews with him explaining his conversion to Islam. There are some really nice bonus features from 1971 as well as the classic Teaser & The Firecat Moonshadow animated feature.,5,"February 22, 1976 College of William and Mary",1372809600,"07 3, 2013",2013,567,"['dvd/cd', 'combo', 'set', 'catches', 'Cat', 'Stevens', 'band', 'midst', 'Majikat', 'Earth', 'tour', 'North', 'America', 'Cat', 'company', 'were', 'touring', 'support', 'Numbers', 'album', 'was', 'last', 'major', 'tour', 'nearly', '30', 'year', 'layoff', 'performances', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'picture/sound', 'quality', 'are', 'amazing', 'wish', 'concert', 'look', 'sounded', 'good', 'are', 'also', 'recent', 'interviews', 'explaining', 'conversion', 'Islam', 'are', 'really', 'nice', 'bonus', 'features', '1971', 'as', 'well', 'classic', 'Teaser', 'Firecat', 'Moonshadow', 'animated', 'feature']",N/A
