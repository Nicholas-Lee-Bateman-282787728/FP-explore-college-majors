He always plays something in each tale. These are fun to watch when you are in the mood to watch some low budget supernatural made for TV stories. I like the gritty black and white photography as it has a certain feel that color cant match. The 2 dvds are in this really cool tin. I think Karloff completists would want this and fans of Karloff should give this a try. It is inexpensive so why not.If you liked Karloff's worst films, you'll have a good time watching these back to back with some popcorn and an unlit room.",5,Karloff completists & fans should check this out,1245542400,"06 21, 2009",2009,626,"['think', 'are', 'series', 'really', 'cool', 'supernatural', 'stories', 'starring', 'hosted', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'always', 'something', 'tale', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'when', 'are', 'mood', 'watch', 'low', 'budget', 'supernatural', 'made', 'TV', 'stories', 'gritty', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'certain', 'feel', 'color', 'cant', 'match', '2', 'dvds', 'are', 'really', 'cool', 'tin', 'think', 'Karloff', 'completists', 'would', 'want', 'fans', 'Karloff', 'should', 'give', 'try', 'inexpensive', 'so', 'why', 'not.If', 'liked', 'Karloff', 'worst', 'films', ""'ll"", 'have', 'good', 'time', 'watching', 'back', 'back', 'popcorn', 'unlit', 'room']",Tales of the Unexplained - From Behind the Veil - 10 episodes featuring Boris Karloff
