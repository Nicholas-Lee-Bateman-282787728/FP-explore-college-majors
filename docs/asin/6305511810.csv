It has a few familiar characters, such as Pirotess and Ashram. But don't expect this to be Lodoss. Though there are some similarities, this is different. The plot isn't bad, but parts are a bit hard to follow. Maybe if there had been more episodes, more material could have been covered, and more explained. Even so, you can follow it, and Legend of Crystania keeps you entertained.The animation isn't bad. The characters (Pirotess and Ashram) look different, but I thought that was good, so that you're able to keep it separate from Lodoss. For the most part the animation looks very good.The music threw me a bit. It tended to be a bit jazz-y and I didn't expect that. But it wasn't bad.The ending was....well.....I don't want to spoil it, but I was a little disappointed. That's why I give it 3 1/2 instead of 4 stars. Don't get me wrong, there was really nothing wrong with it, it wraps up the major plot points fairly well, and it was more satisfying than some anime I've seen, but it wasn't exactly what I was hoping for.All in all, I'd recommend it. You might want to rent it first, I can see how some would be upset with themselves for spending the money on it. However, I'm not. I'm glad I bought it. To me, it's like a Lodoss fanfiction. Interesting to look at, but ultimately just not part of the story, if you can understand that. And if you watch this with a mindset like that, you'll probably like it a lot.",4,That's actually 3 1/2 stars......,1168300800,"01 9, 2007",2007,1551,"['Legend', 'Crystania', '..where', 'should', 'begin', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'are', 'fan', 'Lodoss', 'will', 'probably', 'appeal', 'few', 'familiar', 'characters', 'such', 'Pirotess', 'Ashram', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'Lodoss', 'are', 'similarities', 'different', 'plot', ""n't"", 'bad', 'parts', 'are', 'bit', 'hard', 'follow', 'Maybe', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'episodes', 'more', 'material', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'covered', 'more', 'explained', 'Even', 'so', 'can', 'follow', 'Legend', 'Crystania', 'entertained.The', 'animation', ""n't"", 'bad', 'characters', 'Pirotess', 'Ashram', 'look', 'different', 'thought', 'was', 'good', ""'re"", 'able', 'keep', 'separate', 'Lodoss', 'most', 'part', 'animation', 'very', 'good.The', 'music', 'threw', 'bit', 'tended', 'be', 'bit', 'jazz-y', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad.The', 'ending', 'was', '.well', '..I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'why', 'give', '3', '1/2', 'instead', '4', 'stars', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'was', 'really', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'up', 'major', 'plot', 'points', 'fairly', 'well', 'was', 'more', 'satisfying', 'anime', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'hoping', 'for.All', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'might', 'want', 'rent', 'first', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'would', 'be', 'upset', 'spending', 'money', 'However', ""'m"", 'not', ""'m"", 'glad', 'bought', 'Lodoss', 'fanfiction', 'Interesting', 'look', 'ultimately', 'just', 'not', 'part', 'story', 'can', 'understand', 'watch', 'mindset', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'lot']",N/A

This is the sequel to that movie. I had to do a bit of research on the internet prior to buying it as I already had the movie.  If you enjoyed the movie, you will enjoy this, as it is better.  The story is not of the depth or scope of the Lodoss DVDs.  It, however, has very good animation, no still pictures charging into battle as in Lodoss.  The voice acting suffers a bit from overly hormonal actors, which seems to plague the English voice tracks in anime.  Overall I enjoyed it and gave it 4 stars only because, I gave Lodoss 5 and it is not that good.",4,This is the Sequel to Legend of Crystania,1034467200,"10 13, 2002",2002,675,"['found', 'none', 'previous', 'reviews', 'deal', 'movie', 'refer', 'back', 'Legend', 'Crystania', 'Movie', 'sequel', 'movie', 'had', 'do', 'bit', 'research', 'internet', 'prior', 'buying', 'already', 'had', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'will', 'enjoy', 'better', 'story', 'not', 'depth', 'scope', 'Lodoss', 'DVDs', 'however', 'very', 'good', 'animation', 'still', 'charging', 'battle', 'Lodoss', 'voice', 'acting', 'suffers', 'bit', 'overly', 'hormonal', 'actors', 'plague', 'English', 'voice', 'tracks', 'anime', 'Overall', 'enjoyed', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'only', 'gave', 'Lodoss', '5', 'not', 'good']",N/A
467970,A2ZNJKY01ANDHG,6305511810,"John A. Kuczma ""RogueUlfric""","[14, 17]","As has been said by previous reviewers, Legend of Crystania is not a sequel to Record of Lodoss Wars, although it appears to bill itself as such.  While the names of Lord Ashrom and the dark elf Pirotess are employed, and the hero bears a striking resemblance to Parn of RLW, that is where the similarities end.The animation is average at best.  The voice acting is somewhere between indifferent and poor, and the character depictions flat terrible.  The dark elf acts nothing like any dark elf I've ever seen or read about.  Another character is apparently meant to be a berserker, but is only a pale shadow of what he could or should be.All these problems notwithstanding, the story somehow holds together and manages to retain the viewer's interest.  By the end, you may actually find yourself hoping that Ashrom and Pirotess at last have a chance for mutual happiness.  Weak as it is, Legend of Crystania does work.If you approach this DVD hoping it will be a continuation of the Lodoss War saga, you will be disappointed.  However, if you can set that preconception aside and accept Legend of Crystania as a sword and sorcery tale entirely its own, you may find it a surprisingly satisfying story.Recommended, but just barely.",3,Mediocre but strangely haunting tale,974937600,"11 23, 2000",2000,1231,"['been', 'said', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'Legend', 'Crystania', 'not', 'sequel', 'Record', 'Lodoss', 'Wars', 'bill', 'such', 'names', 'Lord', 'Ashrom', 'dark', 'elf', 'Pirotess', 'are', 'employed', 'hero', 'striking', 'resemblance', 'Parn', 'RLW', 'where', 'similarities', 'end.The', 'animation', 'average', 'best', 'voice', 'acting', 'somewhere', 'indifferent', 'poor', 'character', 'depictions', 'flat', 'terrible', 'dark', 'elf', 'nothing', 'dark', 'elf', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'read', 'character', 'apparently', 'meant', 'be', 'berserker', 'only', 'pale', 'shadow', 'what', 'could', 'should', 'be.All', 'problems', 'notwithstanding', 'story', 'somehow', 'together', 'retain', 'viewer', 'interest', 'end', 'may', 'actually', 'find', 'hoping', 'Ashrom', 'Pirotess', 'last', 'have', 'chance', 'mutual', 'happiness', 'Legend', 'Crystania', 'work.If', 'approach', 'DVD', 'hoping', 'will', 'be', 'continuation', 'Lodoss', 'War', 'saga', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'However', 'can', 'set', 'preconception', 'aside', 'accept', 'Legend', 'Crystania', 'sword', 'sorcery', 'tale', 'entirely', 'own', 'may', 'find', 'surprisingly', 'satisfying', 'story.Recommended', 'just', 'barely']",N/A
467971,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,6305511810,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[1, 1]",This story takes place long after the Lodoss series. Ashram leads the Marmo to a new home and makes a deal with a god spirit to save them. He is possessed by the spirit and becomes an evil tyrannical ruler.This series disappointed the heck out of me. The only character that you will recognize from Lodoss is Pirotess. Her appearance and attitude are completely different. She may as well be a different character all together. The animation is not that good and the voice actors are awful. The whole premise and story are not bad though; but the bottom line is I don't think you should spend money on this anime.,2,It's a very medicore sequel to a fantastic show,1350518400,"10 18, 2012",2012,613,"['story', 'place', 'long', 'Lodoss', 'series', 'Ashram', 'Marmo', 'new', 'home', 'deal', 'god', 'spirit', 'save', 'possessed', 'spirit', 'evil', 'tyrannical', 'ruler.This', 'series', 'disappointed', 'heck', 'only', 'character', 'will', 'recognize', 'Lodoss', 'Pirotess', 'appearance', 'attitude', 'are', 'completely', 'different', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'different', 'character', 'together', 'animation', 'not', 'good', 'voice', 'actors', 'are', 'awful', 'whole', 'premise', 'story', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'bottom', 'line', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'should', 'spend', 'money', 'anime']",N/A

Despite it's billing, it has no tie-in with the Lodoss world besides a 2 minute history intro and a couple of names thrown out at the very beginning.Beyond that, the story is indifferent, and the animation is poor. It has none of the sharp style and bright contrasts that typically makes for good anime, coming across blurry and dull instead (and that goes for both the animation AND the story!).Imagine that someone took a water-color version of the Lodoss War, erased the story, and then left it out in the rain overnight.
