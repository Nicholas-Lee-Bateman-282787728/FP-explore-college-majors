This performance was his best and not surprisingly his attitudes still prevail. The honesty, tenderness  compassion supposedly taught him from the Cheyenne training is present in this role although we see a more mature attitude. Worth buying and I will watch it many times. I have all his series that are out there but one wonders why the power of money people have so ignored his talent. My husband laughed at my crush on Clint Walker...of course we were 1500 miles apart but he is #1 in my book.
