As a result, the quality is horrible.  White Zombie, a real gem, is from a bad VHS transfer so all of the nuances and production values are lost.  If they were cleaner version, I would recommend it much more highly.  Either way, some really unique films are included.",3,I am really torn on this one,1381708800,"10 14, 2013",2013,399,"['collection', 'really', 'rare', 'items', 'wonderful', 'bad', 'part', 'most', 'film', 'are', 'public', 'domain', 'result', 'quality', 'horrible', 'White', 'Zombie', 'real', 'gem', 'bad', 'VHS', 'transfer', 'so', 'nuances', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'lost', 'were', 'cleaner', 'version', 'would', 'recommend', 'much', 'more', 'highly', 'way', 'really', 'unique', 'films', 'are', 'included']",Bela Lugosi: Scared to Death Collection

Matthews,"[11, 11]","Reviewing the 20 Bela Lugosi film set that came out in February 2013 (in case this review gets later mixed with other product listings).If you're a Bela Lugosi fan like me, you're always looking for a cheap way to pick up some more of his films that you haven't seen.  I'll keep this review short -- the listed movies are there, intact, and playable.  If you know anything about Bela Lugosi, you know these are his B and C movie roles, but some of them are memorable.  The packaging on this is something like I've never seen -- each disk rests in a slab of what seems like super thick fiberboard, almost like masonite or MDF.  It wastes a good bit of shelfspace, but it is sturdy and easy to keep organized.The transfer quality is of the lowest quality, but not so bad as to be a ripoff or something that shouldn't be sold.  These movies average about $1 each with the Amazon prices -- you can't ask for much better.So if you just wanted to get to see some more Bela Lugosi films, go ahead, this set will do the trick.",4,It's not a ripoff,1362873600,"03 10, 2013",2013,1018,"['Reviewing', '20', 'Bela', 'Lugosi', 'film', 'set', 'came', 'out', 'February', '2013', 'case', 'review', 'later', 'mixed', 'other', 'product', 'listings', '.If', ""'re"", 'Bela', 'Lugosi', 'fan', ""'re"", 'always', 'looking', 'cheap', 'way', 'pick', 'up', 'more', 'films', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'review', 'short', 'listed', 'movies', 'are', 'there', 'intact', 'playable', 'know', 'anything', 'Bela', 'Lugosi', 'know', 'are', 'B', 'C', 'movie', 'roles', 'are', 'memorable', 'packaging', 'something', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'disk', 'slab', 'what', 'super', 'thick', 'fiberboard', 'almost', 'masonite', 'MDF', 'good', 'bit', 'shelfspace', 'sturdy', 'easy', 'keep', 'organized.The', 'transfer', 'quality', 'lowest', 'quality', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'be', 'ripoff', 'something', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'sold', 'movies', 'average', '1', 'Amazon', 'prices', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ask', 'much', 'better.So', 'just', 'wanted', 'get', 'see', 'more', 'Bela', 'Lugosi', 'films', 'go', 'ahead', 'set', 'will', 'do', 'trick']",Bela Lugosi: Scared to Death Collection

1578039,A20FCAGYLJ231D,B008XB2U9W,Norrin Radd,"[16, 16]","I was trying to add a few new Lugosi titles that I didn't have with this 20 movies set. The price was very reasonable at around a dollar each. About half I already had in other sets. It still is worth it. The movie quality and sound is fair, but so are other movies I have got from other collections. They are old movies and it's nice to be able to see them at all. Overall this is worth the money to find all these Lugosi movies together in a nice boxed set.I like the way the dvd's are stored in each of the two volume boxes (half in each). It's safe and won't scratch. Sturdy and well made  Easy to get in and out. Just a cardboard holder to set each disc in individually that opens like a fold out book with each dvd facing you when totally opened. Each dvd has two movies on each. Each dvd has the 2 movie titles and one of the movies pictured on it. The box pictured in the ad is the outside covering that I just put into storage.I wish this was out before when I started my collection. It would have been priceless to begin with. Now it's still a great deal to find all together. No extras to talk about. Nothing fancy. Just old Lugosi movies at a nice price.

The inside is particularly nice with a great photo of a Primetime Bela and a well-written biography.  Looks great on the bookshelf!
