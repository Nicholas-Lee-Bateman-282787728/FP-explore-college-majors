Just for a paycheck.  I couldn't even finish watching it.,2,a dud,1365379200,"04 8, 2013",2013,192,"['was', 'not', 'good', 'gangster', 'movie', 'actors', 'talents', 'were', 'totally', 'wasted', 'film', 'what', 'call', 'payday', 'movie', 'Just', 'paycheck', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'finish', 'watching']",Dillinger And Capone
691524,A1Q1BQMDR1GES2,B000060MVX,PAUL PISANO,"[0, 0]",i liked this what if story. roger corman has always been a favorite of mine. his movies have action in them and doesn't bore the audience. i believe corman also did the st valentine's day massacre another favorite of mine. martin sheen and f murray abraham also give great performances. Capone who was supposedly afraid of needles need not die from syphilis. one must also wonder if Dillinger was actually killed in front of the theater. melvin purvis never lived that one down and died in disgrace. hoover wanted Dillinger alive because he believed Dillinger had information on much of the corruption in the various police forces.,5,worth the money,1366934400,"04 26, 2013",2013,631,"['i', 'liked', 'what', 'story', 'roger', 'corman', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'mine', 'movies', 'have', 'action', ""n't"", 'bore', 'audience', 'i', 'believe', 'corman', 'also', 'did', 'st', 'valentine', 'day', 'massacre', 'favorite', 'mine', 'martin', 'sheen', 'f', 'murray', 'abraham', 'also', 'give', 'great', 'performances', 'Capone', 'who', 'was', 'supposedly', 'afraid', 'needles', 'need', 'not', 'die', 'syphilis', 'one', 'must', 'also', 'wonder', 'Dillinger', 'was', 'actually', 'killed', 'front', 'theater', 'melvin', 'purvis', 'never', 'lived', 'one', 'down', 'died', 'disgrace', 'hoover', 'wanted', 'Dillinger', 'alive', 'believed', 'Dillinger', 'had', 'information', 'much', 'corruption', 'various', 'police', 'forces']",Dillinger And Capone
