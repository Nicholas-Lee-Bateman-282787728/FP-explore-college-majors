1637698,A39H1GO9E3YQIB,B00BQXTCVS,a,"[0, 1]","Jack Taylor is a likeable, flawed, and alcoholic private detective in the Irish city of Galway, where he was once a police officer and is something of a local celebrity. The three mystery movies that make up this set each run between 85 and 95 minutes, and they each get progressively better and more engaging until the conclusion of the third and final episode made me very eager for more.  I know that two additional episodes aired in Ireland several months ago, and it's frustrating not to have those included here (especially since the European release includes all five episodes).  Nevertheless, it's hard not to be drawn to the solid writing, competent acting, and vivid characters of the ""Jack Taylor"" series.Iain Glen is excellent in the lead, and the two primary recurring characters, played by Killian Scott and Nora-Jane Noone, are likeable, somewhat complex associates for the hard-drinking private detective.  After a mere three episodes, I am left eager to know more about these characters and how their relationship(s) will evolve over the next two feature-length stories. The three mysteries presented here are local stories, rich in detail and suspense. Having recently watched the comparable Australian crime series ""Jack Irish,"" I can say that I most definitely prefer the adventures of ""Jack Taylor.""  Unlike ""Jack Irish,"" here the plots are focused locally and don't always involve mysterious powerful figures who wield armies of gun-toting minions.  And the episodes do get progressively better, with episode three, ""The Magdalen Martyrs,"" emerging as one of the best television murder mysteries I have seen in recent memory.It took between two and three years for these programs to be available stateside.  Here's hoping we don't have that long of a wait for the remainder of the series because this really is good stuff.",5,Three excellent Irish crime dramas,1383609600,"11 5, 2013",2013,1844,"['Jack', 'Taylor', 'likeable', 'flawed', 'alcoholic', 'private', 'detective', 'Irish', 'city', 'Galway', 'where', 'was', 'once', 'police', 'officer', 'something', 'local', 'celebrity', 'three', 'mystery', 'movies', 'make', 'up', 'set', 'run', '85', '95', 'minutes', 'get', 'progressively', 'better', 'more', 'engaging', 'conclusion', 'third', 'final', 'episode', 'made', 'very', 'eager', 'more', 'know', 'two', 'additional', 'episodes', 'aired', 'Ireland', 'several', 'months', 'ago', 'frustrating', 'not', 'have', 'included', 'here', 'especially', 'European', 'release', 'five', 'episodes', 'Nevertheless', 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'drawn', 'solid', 'writing', 'competent', 'acting', 'vivid', 'characters', 'Jack', 'Taylor', 'series.Iain', 'Glen', 'excellent', 'lead', 'two', 'primary', 'recurring', 'characters', 'played', 'Killian', 'Scott', 'Nora-Jane', 'Noone', 'are', 'likeable', 'somewhat', 'complex', 'associates', 'hard-drinking', 'private', 'detective', 'mere', 'three', 'episodes', 'am', 'left', 'eager', 'know', 'more', 'characters', 'how', 'relationship', 's', 'will', 'evolve', 'next', 'two', 'feature-length', 'stories', 'three', 'mysteries', 'presented', 'here', 'are', 'local', 'stories', 'rich', 'detail', 'suspense', 'Having', 'recently', 'watched', 'comparable', 'Australian', 'crime', 'series', 'Jack', 'Irish', 'can', 'say', 'most', 'definitely', 'prefer', 'adventures', 'Jack', 'Taylor', 'Jack', 'Irish', 'here', 'plots', 'are', 'focused', 'locally', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'involve', 'mysterious', 'powerful', 'figures', 'who', 'wield', 'armies', 'gun-toting', 'minions', 'episodes', 'do', 'get', 'progressively', 'better', 'episode', 'three', 'Magdalen', 'Martyrs', 'emerging', 'one', 'best', 'television', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'have', 'seen', 'recent', 'memory.It', 'took', 'two', 'three', 'years', 'programs', 'be', 'available', 'stateside', 'Here', 'hoping', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'long', 'wait', 'remainder', 'series', 'really', 'good', 'stuff']","JACK TAYLOR, SET 1"

Jack Taylor was a little more low key, but ran along a similar vein - a former &#34;cop&#34; who was had to leave due to things he did while drinking. Now working as a P.I. (or &#34;finder&#34;), Jack is willing to push any limits - which makes him appealing to clients, and he'll take cases the cops won't look at, or put on the back burner.  Jack's cases that take him into some of the rougher areas of Galaway in Ireland - the scenery is real - which is a real bonus.

Jack Taylor, who *is* Irish, is a former policeman who now works as a hard drinking, hard boiled private investigator in the working class dock town of Galway, Ireland.  From here, the two stories converge.Jack (either) holds court in the local pub, accepts cases that start simply enough and begin to unfold like petals on a wilting rose.  In t he process, Jack gets to sleep with one or two women, engage in a car chase or two, encounter a few mangled/decaying corpses, and get severely beaten.  Characters come, characters go, and there's always a usually obvious twist at the end.  My high school football coach had two sayings, ""When you have a play that works, run it to death"" and ""Run, run, pass, kick"".  We didn't win many games and he always knew what came next.The directing, editing, and camera work is less than subtle.  Everyone knows what to say and the main characters say their likes with appropriate meaning and emphasis,  However, facial expressions frequently don't match what's going on and scenes can carry on long enough to see actors drop character.Both disks have English subtitles available.  That is handy unless you are really good at digging through accents.There are a few differences.  Background music is good in both and better in Jack Irish.  Jack Taylor is a bit more violent and graphic.  It also has Iain Glen acting as both lead and narrator.

So don't buy this expecting to get a TV series, because you'll probably be disappointed.  That said, the stories do have a fair amount of continuity from one to the other, so if you watch them out of order, you'll be missing out on bits of the character's life and his relationships with others.That said, Jack Taylor is a set of really good neo-noir crime movies set in Galway, Ireland.  Jack used to be a member of the Garda, the local police force, until he lost his temper with a well-connected politician and then lost his job.  He hung on to his Garda coat, however, a snazzy blue number, and their attempts to get it back form a small running joke in the movies.  The movies, taken from a series of books by Ken Bruen, are quite interesting.  Jack takes up private eye work, and investigates a series of murders of young women, a local vigilante group, and tracks down a really evil former nun nicknamed &#34;Lucifer&#34; by the young women forced into her care.  Along the way, he drinks a lot (something of a cliche), tries to deal with his mother and the priest who looks out for her, cultivates a source in the Garda, and acquires a young sidekick who worships the ground Jack walks on.Iain Glen is fantastic, and the supporting cast is equally wonderful in their roles.

Each episode is 90 minutes long and on its own disc. And if I hadn't promised to review this item, I would have stopped with the first episode, The Guards.With the setting in Ireland, Jack Taylor is a former Guard (cop) with a major drinking problem. He's requested--kind of against his will--to investigate the drowning suicide of a young woman found in the exact place another woman's body had been found earlier. My problem with the episode was twofold. The first was in trying to follow the dialogue. Not just the accents but some of the slang used. That might be why I had the second problem; not understanding the flow of the investigation. How did we reach looking at this one guy as a suspect?I did actually have an easier time following both the dialog and the investigation with the other two episodes and I found each subsequent episode easier to sit through. The who and why aspect of the mystery is good, as is the actor.Jack is a difficult character to like and get to know, mostly due to his excessive drinking. Expect to see a lot of scenes inside a pub. But with each episode, we learn more about him and his attitude starts changing in regards to people asking him for help. By that third episode, it's now become a business. He also gets the crap beat out of him in each episode, but like a stubborn bulldog, doesn't let it slow him down much. That could get real old really fast if that continues in the series.And while overall I felt that viewing this 3 episode set was okay, I can't see myself looking for more episodes to watch.",3,Difficult time getting into it,1383436800,"11 3, 2013",2013,1656,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'books', 'seen', 'TV', 'show', 'getting', 'set', 'first', '3', 'episodes', 'aired', 'episode', '90', 'minutes', 'long', 'own', 'disc', 'had', ""n't"", 'promised', 'review', 'item', 'would', 'have', 'stopped', 'first', 'episode', 'Guards.With', 'setting', 'Ireland', 'Jack', 'Taylor', 'former', 'Guard', 'cop', 'major', 'drinking', 'problem', 'requested', 'kind', 'will', 'investigate', 'drowning', 'suicide', 'young', 'woman', 'found', 'exact', 'place', 'woman', 'body', 'had', 'been', 'found', 'earlier', 'problem', 'episode', 'was', 'twofold', 'first', 'was', 'trying', 'follow', 'dialogue', 'Not', 'just', 'accents', 'slang', 'used', 'might', 'be', 'why', 'had', 'second', 'problem', 'not', 'understanding', 'flow', 'investigation', 'How', 'did', 'reach', 'looking', 'one', 'guy', 'suspect', 'did', 'actually', 'have', 'easier', 'time', 'following', 'dialog', 'investigation', 'other', 'two', 'episodes', 'found', 'subsequent', 'episode', 'easier', 'sit', 'who', 'why', 'aspect', 'mystery', 'good', 'actor.Jack', 'difficult', 'character', 'like', 'get', 'know', 'mostly', 'due', 'excessive', 'drinking', 'Expect', 'see', 'lot', 'scenes', 'pub', 'episode', 'learn', 'more', 'attitude', 'changing', 'regards', 'people', 'asking', 'help', 'third', 'episode', 'now', 'become', 'business', 'also', 'crap', 'beat', 'episode', 'stubborn', 'bulldog', ""n't"", 'let', 'slow', 'down', 'much', 'could', 'get', 'real', 'old', 'really', 'fast', 'series.And', 'overall', 'felt', 'viewing', '3', 'episode', 'set', 'was', 'okay', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'looking', 'more', 'episodes', 'watch']","JACK TAYLOR, SET 1"

Down and out in his native Galway, Taylor takes up a sideline as a private detective which, as he explains, is considered a bit dodgy in Ireland, with its history of IRA-related troubles.  Nonetheless, he is drawn into a few cases, due to his innate sense of decency, as well as his stubborn streak, which makes him follow through on cases as soon as he's told to butt out.The gruff, abrasive tone of the series may be a turnoff for some - I found the first episode a bit crude and too on-the-nose, though each episode after that was a little better. This series lacks the subtlety of many recent crime dramas -- &#34;The Wire,&#34; &#34;Breaking Bad,&#34; etc -- but viewers who are in search of grittier, rougher fare may find it compelling. One thing I really liked was the use of the local settings, in particular the use of the fabled Crane pub, in Galway's Claddagh enclave, as Taylor's bar of choice: if you're ever in Galway looking for good local music, a pint or two at the Crane is highly recommended. Also of interest are points in the stories where Taylor reflects on how much Galway has changed in the last couple of decades, after Ireland's entry into the EU, the economic boom (and bust) of the 2000s, and the huge amount of new construction and social change that came with it. An incomplete but valuable glimpse into the face of the new Ireland, as well as a tough-edged crime drama.

1637718,A1I477ADGMLVJM,B00BQXTCVS,"D. Matlack ""Guidedog""","[0, 1]","Well, II have to admit The Jack Taylor series is leaving me a bit flummoxed.Of course this might be because I have absolutely no familiarity at all with the novels written by Ken Bruen, in which each stand-alone episode is based. From the book reviews they sound like they are very dark.The Jack Taylor movies are a gritty police-noir genre that is more comparable to an American series or even the Swedish Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, than the typical British detective. Each episode in this series revolved around missing girls (The Guards and Pikemen) or the mistreatment of women (the Magdalen Martyrs).Jack Taylor has lost his job as a cop thanks to heavy drinking and head-butting a perp that happened to be a politician. His claim to fame is finding people, however as a viewer I found the filming to be disjointed when it comes to Jack's heavy drinking. The focus fades and tilts and we get to black out right alongside Jack. When he comes to days have passed and for many of us who follow crime dramas this can be very disconcerting since as we know, time is of the essence when it comes to finding missing persons. For this reason alone I watched every episode with a strong sense of anxiety. My only relief is that in the Pikeman gains a competent partner in Cody Farraher, a young ambitious man, who quite frankly gets most of the research and leg work done and of course Jack relies heavily on his former co-worker, Garda Kate Noonan. On his own Jack is drunk and kinda all over the place. And the time line for the movies are not necessarily in consecutive order - in fact over a year passes between the first two which adds its share of confusion since clearly situations occurred in Jack's life off-screen that somehow factor in with the current action in ways that are not always discernible.The Guards is set up to primarily set up the characters, unfortunately there are a few unnecessaries such as Anne Hennessy, who might be a client or might be a red herring. Her character becomes inexplicably involved with Jack and really seems to be a one off. Yet she returns in The Pikeman for yet another highly improbable reason and only seems to muddy the story lines of both movies. I was glad to see her gone in the Magdalen Martyrs.Adding high on the improbability list, is that in all three movies there are highly unlikely connections between Jack and key suspects/contacts that quiet frankly put this in the ""what are the odds of this happening outside of a cartoon?"" realm. ""The Guards"" will have us re-thinking our friends if we take it too seriously and in ""The Magalen Martyers"" we find out why Jack has such a crap-bag mum.The cast is top notch and every episode is well acted. Those of us who are keeping up with Game of Thrones and Downton Abby will be thrilled to see yet another facet to Iain Glen. Tho' many viewers might also be put off or confused by the accents, some are thick and quite difficult to hear or understand for our North American ears. Yet as I previously mentioned, it appears that these movies were put together under the assumption that the viewer is familiar with Ken Bruen's books. Definitely entertaining and far-fetched for a crime drama.",3,Gritty Police Drama that is all over the place:WARNING Possible spoilers,1384300800,"11 13, 2013",2013,3198,"['Well', 'II', 'have', 'admit', 'Jack', 'Taylor', 'series', 'leaving', 'bit', 'flummoxed.Of', 'course', 'might', 'be', 'have', 'absolutely', 'familiarity', 'novels', 'written', 'Ken', 'Bruen', 'stand-alone', 'episode', 'based', 'book', 'sound', 'are', 'very', 'dark.The', 'Jack', 'Taylor', 'movies', 'are', 'gritty', 'police-noir', 'genre', 'more', 'comparable', 'American', 'series', 'even', 'Swedish', 'Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'series', 'typical', 'British', 'detective', 'episode', 'series', 'revolved', 'missing', 'girls', 'Guards', 'Pikemen', 'mistreatment', 'women', 'Magdalen', 'Martyrs', '.Jack', 'Taylor', 'lost', 'job', 'cop', 'thanks', 'heavy', 'drinking', 'head-butting', 'perp', 'happened', 'be', 'politician', 'claim', 'fame', 'finding', 'people', 'however', 'viewer', 'found', 'filming', 'be', 'disjointed', 'when', 'Jack', 'heavy', 'drinking', 'focus', 'fades', 'tilts', 'get', 'black', 'out', 'right', 'alongside', 'Jack', 'When', 'days', 'have', 'passed', 'many', 'who', 'follow', 'crime', 'dramas', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'disconcerting', 'know', 'time', 'essence', 'when', 'finding', 'missing', 'persons', 'reason', 'alone', 'watched', 'episode', 'strong', 'sense', 'anxiety', 'only', 'relief', 'Pikeman', 'gains', 'competent', 'partner', 'Cody', 'Farraher', 'young', 'ambitious', 'man', 'who', 'quite', 'frankly', 'most', 'research', 'leg', 'work', 'done', 'course', 'Jack', 'heavily', 'former', 'co-worker', 'Garda', 'Kate', 'Noonan', 'own', 'Jack', 'drunk', 'kinda', 'place', 'time', 'line', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'consecutive', 'order', 'fact', 'year', 'first', 'two', 'share', 'confusion', 'clearly', 'situations', 'occurred', 'Jack', 'life', 'off-screen', 'somehow', 'factor', 'current', 'action', 'ways', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'discernible.The', 'Guards', 'set', 'up', 'primarily', 'set', 'up', 'characters', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'few', 'unnecessaries', 'such', 'Anne', 'Hennessy', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'client', 'might', 'be', 'red', 'herring', 'character', 'inexplicably', 'involved', 'Jack', 'really', 'be', 'one', 'off', 'Pikeman', 'yet', 'highly', 'improbable', 'reason', 'only', 'muddy', 'story', 'lines', 'movies', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'gone', 'Magdalen', 'Martyrs.Adding', 'high', 'improbability', 'list', 'three', 'movies', 'are', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'connections', 'Jack', 'key', 'suspects/contacts', 'quiet', 'frankly', 'put', 'are', 'odds', 'happening', 'outside', 'cartoon', 'realm', 'Guards', 'will', 'have', 're-thinking', 'friends', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'Magalen', 'Martyers', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'Jack', 'such', 'crap-bag', 'mum.The', 'cast', 'top', 'notch', 'episode', 'well', 'acted', 'who', 'are', 'keeping', 'up', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'Downton', 'Abby', 'will', 'be', 'thrilled', 'see', 'yet', 'facet', 'Iain', 'Glen', 'Tho', 'many', 'viewers', 'might', 'also', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'confused', 'accents', 'are', 'thick', 'quite', 'difficult', 'hear', 'understand', 'North', 'American', 'ears', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'movies', 'were', 'put', 'together', 'assumption', 'viewer', 'familiar', 'Ken', 'Bruen', 'books', 'Definitely', 'entertaining', 'far-fetched', 'crime', 'drama']","JACK TAYLOR, SET 1"

His reasons for leaving the force are only hinted at; they must have been heavy, however, because he doesn't have a lot of cred at the Galway Garda headquarters - and he is a walking index of vices, all self-directed. One gets the feeling immediately, however, that under all that unshaven, alcoholic aura, there is a good man who has been dealt one too many aces and eights in his time and is, to put it mildly, world-weary. He does have people who believe in him; a stalwart, feisty, and warm landlady, who never turns Jack down for a place to stay; a young female cop, in her own struggle to survive in the perennial political fog of bureaucracy; a number of older Galway residents, who have known Jack all his life; and a somewhat-goofy young guy who has followed everything Jack Taylor has ever done - and now follows him like a puppy, trying to convince him to accept him as an assistant. Yes, assistant; Jack has fallen headlong into a new career; private investigator.One would think, from watching this, that Galway is rather a small, perhaps too-well-related place; everybody seems to know everybody, and Jack's investigations find him running into people over and over again who are connected by the oddest of threads. He has a genious for finding the most obscure clues, and he also attracts a lot of less-than-admiring followers. He's hard-bitten in more ways than one. It's a miracle that he survives some of his encounters with the bad elements his poking around turns up. And many try to steer him away from his investigations - but tenacity is Jack's middle name.Interspersed with his professional life is an ongoing battle of wills with his mother - which comes to a head in the last story, and reveals itself to be tied to his familial troubles - and a detante he has made with the local priest, who seems to be always at the places Jack ends up at and is also curiously close to Jack's mother.This is a dark, film-nourish crime series and is totally captivating. For all his fallen ways, Jack is a character who commands immediate affection and loyalty from those who find their way to this series. Tightly written and well-performed, the stories suck you in; there are no slow areas, and the end always comes too soon. I wish there had been more to the series; I grew very fond of Jack, and those he worked with.

1637724,A1IH42TUIZ2XJL,B00BQXTCVS,Gab,"[1, 2]","Iain Glen portrays Jack Taylor in a brilliant and mesmerizing performance. Taylor is a legendary former Garda  (Irish Detective/Policeman) who was drummed out of the force, but remains a folk hero. In the first film, his portrait appears all over Galway on walls, buses, etc.  He is in his forties, a heavy drinker,  fearless and tough. He rents  room and board from an admiring woman who runs a small boardinghouse.  He retains his uniform's coat, despite being harassed by his former colleagues, subsequently promoted to higher ranks, to return it. This coat appears the only thread that binds him to his former position. Fortuitously, a young female officer on the force, at great risk to her career, is an ""insider"" friend. Along the way, he also forms a ""partnership"" with Cody, a young fatherless man who worships Taylor's background and becomes an acolyte.The disc contains three separate mysteries in which Taylor is what is almost unheard of in Galway, a private detective. He takes unbelievable physical abuse in each of the intriguing feature length films, yet also seems to be able to recover and slog on the solve mysteries that may or may not be connected.The writing is brilliant and based upon crime novels written by Ken Bruen. The scenery and Galway settings are a perfect backdrop for these stories.The three films are: ""The Guards,"" ""The Pikemen,"" and ""The Magdalen Martyrs.""Fortunately, the films are closed-captioned for those of us who may have hearing or comprehension challenges.

Jack Taylor, played with abundant skill by Iain Glen, is Ken Bruen's an ex-irish guard cop turned PI with a bit of a drinking problem - a detective/private eye/finder who has been dismissed from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Irish police) and is now finding things for people in Galway, Ireland. The Irish call their gumshoes ""finders"" since ""private eye"" sounds too much like ""informer"". In Bruen's novels Jack Taylor is a loner...just an alcoholic Galway gumshoe who finds tinkers and Mary Magdalen's and flops often in his room at a local boarding house. His talent is finding people and he eventually solves the crime. The series is at times dark, Jack usually gets a round of beating in each episode. He's tough because has to be, the crimes he explores are ugly, and the solutions are intricately woven together making it almost impossible not to be surprised at the end. But part of the pleasure of these three episodes is the fact that the series is peppered with bits of humor in the Irish fashion - some of the most glib and sarcastic dialogue written.For those who have enjoyed Ian Glen's work on `Game of Thrones' or `Downton Abbey' or `Strike Back' or `The Borgias', this series will please. There are three episodes included - The Guards, The Pikemen, and The Magdalen Martyrs - and each is well crafted and full of Jack Taylorisms. And if you are a fan of UK series this deserves your attention.

Ratcheson,"[2, 6]","Based on the other reviews here I'm apparently in the minority, butin my opinion this show is somewhere between mediocre todreadful.While I love reading, this also illustrates why I review so fewbooks: if a vacuum cleaner sucks (or should I say ""doesn't suck""!), I don'tneed to spend hours finding out so I can tell you. But if a booksucks, my morals say if I'm reviewing it I need to read the entirething, even if I despise it. That is somewhat the case here; truth isI'm bored to tears (I will admit I'm not usually into action films), & Ican only stomach about 10 minutes at a time.I am also not a fan of most contemporary American TV(though Breaking Bad has been a fun guilty pleasure!),or for that matter of the majority of ""modern"" Americanfilm. Not to sound like a snob, but culturally, ""least commondenominator"" rules the day in today's American mass media.As a generalization, I have found that a larger % of films fromalmost all other countries tend to be of higher quality than today'saverage American pap, so that sparked my interest in this. That,& the fact that I reviewed a truly wonderful Australian TV series forVine somewhat recently,Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries.I had hoped this would be of similar quality.No such luck. While we're not at the total bottom feeder mentalityof The Voice, Snooky, etc; the only significant difference betweenthis & the average mindless 2013 American action series is theseshows are twice as long.Thus my title line; I would have preferred 45 minute shows, theywould have been over that much faster!If you enjoy USA action TV (CSI, etc), you'll probably like this.Otherwise, stay away.As far as value, it's a bit pricey for 3 shows, but as they run aprox90 minutes each, it's kind of like 6 USA shows; but still a bit pricey asthe average season of 15-20 episodes is $20 or so these days.I still need to watch & review the (I'm told) similar Jack Irish set.

1637728,A18U9BQQQ0U8F5,B00BQXTCVS,Grieger,"[1, 2]","My wife and I discovered this series on Netflix because of our love of British/European police procedurals and dramas.The basic premise is a bit tired at first. Jack Taylor is a former Garda officer (Irish police) who gets himself into a lot of trouble some of which is the result of him getting lost in the bottle. Nothing new there. But, once you get past that, the individual ""episodes"" and the on-going story of Jack Taylor and his life in Galway are well-written and well-acted.Each episode is really more like a movie in itself (IMDB even lists each episode as standalone TV movies). They run around an hour and a half (likely meant to be two hours with commercials) and with Set 1 you get three of them: The Guards, The Pikemen, and The Magdalen Martyrs. The latter episode is particularly interesting seeing as Nora-Jane Noone, who acts in a supporting role here, starred in the Magdalen Sisters which also goes into the themes in the episode.The stories center around Galway which is rarely seen in movies and shows like this and the character of Jack Taylor toes a fine line between helping those that need it and getting just about everyone else to hate him. Plus, I love that, outside of Iain Glen, all the other actors are Irish, some of which were actually born in Galway, lending a lot more authenticity to the series.I'm not sure if there's a great way to compare this series to others out there. The character and stories aren't quite as serious as Helen Mirren and Prime Suspect, Jack isn't as savant as Robson Green's series, and while he does partner up at some point, you don't get the usual British theme of having partners crossing class lines.But, if you're a fan of British mysteries and detective dramas, I think you'll really enjoy this series. Sure, an ex-cop, alcoholic private investigator getting into trouble all the time sounds tired, but there's a lot more than that. Think of that as the starting anchor that just leads you to the rest of the ship...there's a lot more than that one thing.This is the first set and, based on the episodes that have been released (and appear to be getting produced), there will probably be a set 2 sometime soon.",5,Great series once you ignore the one tired theme,1382832000,"10 27, 2013",2013,2179,"['wife', 'discovered', 'series', 'Netflix', 'love', 'British/European', 'police', 'procedurals', 'dramas.The', 'basic', 'premise', 'bit', 'tired', 'first', 'Jack', 'Taylor', 'former', 'Garda', 'officer', 'Irish', 'police', 'who', 'lot', 'trouble', 'result', 'getting', 'lost', 'bottle', 'Nothing', 'new', 'there', 'once', 'get', 'past', 'individual', 'episodes', 'on-going', 'story', 'Jack', 'Taylor', 'life', 'Galway', 'are', 'well-written', 'well-acted.Each', 'episode', 'really', 'more', 'movie', 'IMDB', 'even', 'episode', 'standalone', 'TV', 'movies', 'run', 'hour', 'half', 'likely', 'meant', 'be', 'two', 'hours', 'commercials', 'Set', '1', 'get', 'three', 'Guards', 'Pikemen', 'Magdalen', 'Martyrs', 'latter', 'episode', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'seeing', 'Nora-Jane', 'Noone', 'who', 'supporting', 'role', 'here', 'starred', 'Magdalen', 'Sisters', 'also', 'themes', 'episode.The', 'stories', 'center', 'Galway', 'rarely', 'seen', 'movies', 'character', 'Jack', 'Taylor', 'fine', 'line', 'helping', 'need', 'getting', 'just', 'everyone', 'else', 'hate', 'love', 'Iain', 'Glen', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'Irish', 'were', 'actually', 'born', 'Galway', 'lending', 'lot', 'more', 'authenticity', 'series.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'great', 'way', 'compare', 'series', 'others', 'out', 'there', 'character', 'stories', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'serious', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Prime', 'Suspect', 'Jack', ""n't"", 'as', 'savant', 'Robson', 'Green', 'series', 'partner', 'up', 'point', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'usual', 'British', 'theme', 'having', 'partners', 'crossing', 'class', 'lines.But', ""'re"", 'fan', 'British', 'mysteries', 'detective', 'dramas', 'think', ""'ll"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'series', 'Sure', 'ex-cop', 'alcoholic', 'private', 'investigator', 'getting', 'trouble', 'time', 'tired', 'lot', 'more', 'Think', 'starting', 'anchor', 'just', 'rest', 'ship', 'lot', 'more', 'one', 'thing.This', 'first', 'set', 'based', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'appear', 'be', 'getting', 'produced', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'set', '2', 'sometime', 'soon']","JACK TAYLOR, SET 1"
1637729,A20FK68BUB1IVA,B00BQXTCVS,Happy Reader,"[0, 1]","Mysteries are my favorite form of entertainment, in books, film and TV.  I appreciate all kinds, from ""Rockford Files"" to ""Midsomer Murders"".  ""Jack Taylor"", set in modern day Galway, Ireland, is in the vein of Helen Mirren's superlative ""Prime Suspect"". Taylor's plotting starts off a little all-over-the-place, but by the third of the 3 episodes in this series, it grabs you by the neck and shakes you.Episode 1: ""The Guards""In the introduction, we see partners Taylor and Clancy in their Garda squad car on the highway. Sergeant Taylor narrates: ""It's almost impossible to get thrown out of the Guards. Unless you become a public disgrace, they'll tolerate most anything."" He then proceeds to chase down a speeding ministry car, and when the fellow gets out to tell Jack he's going to have him fired, Jack knocks his block off.That's why the next scene is of the EX-Guard Taylor. Still drinking too much. Still not sleeping enough, with the craggy face and half-grown beard to prove it. He still rents a room from Mrs. Bailey, who, for reasons not known, treats him like the gentleman he could be. His other best friend is the elderly Sean, who owns The Crane Bar, Taylor's real home. As Taylor tells it, ""She [Mrs. Bailey] and Sean are the only ones to make a man feel he might still have a chance.""To his joy, Jack finds out that his good friend Sutton is back in town, after living on the continent for a while. Sutton is a starving artist, but he's found a patron in Mr. Lanport. While catching up, they see the police working on a crime scene. The body of a young lady, the 4th in four months, has washed up on the beach. The same place as the one last month. Though they still call him Sarge, the cops don't let Jack near the scene. But he wonders, how could two in a row wash up in exactly the same place if they had just jumped from the bridge.Jack tells us, ""The only thing I was ever good at in my life was finding things. Now, as an ex-cop, I have to use this skill to make a iiving.... To be a finder requires patience and pig-stubbornness. The last was my strongest point."" It's an almost respectable living. ""There are no private eyes in Ireland. It's too close to being an informer.""Jack is approached by Anne Henderson to find her estranged daughter, Sarah. Sarah left home and is living by her wits. Anne tells him, ""I just want to know that she's all right.""  Jack gets close, very close, to Anne. But he's bothered, in the back of his mind, why she doesn't always talk like a worried mother.The story strings of Sutton and Anne come together in a melodramatic climax. Sometimes solving a crime is the worst thing.Episode 2: ""The Pikemen""Taylor left Galway after the wrenching denouement of ""The Guards"". But a year later, a letter from Mr. O'Shea brings him back. O'Shea was great pals with Taylor's Da. His only son, Niall, fell from the top of a construction site. The Guards are calling it a suicide, but the grieving father is sure it's not. Will Jack look into it?Meanwhile, Jack is accosted by twenty-something Cody Farraher, with his little spiral notebook and puppy-like enthusiasm. ""I want to make you a business proposition, Jack. You and me. Full partners. Taking on the bad guys. Kicking a**. Seeing justice done.""  This is almost too much for the jaded Jack Taylor, but maybe Cody will be useful.Back at his favorite bar, a talkative customer tells Jack, ""A fellow was found up in Glen Moran with his arms severed. Seems he was a serial burglar. Another fellow fleeced old people of their savings. He was found with his tongue cut out.""Jack: ""Are you saying there are vigilantes in Galway?""Not only are there vigilantes, but there are vigilantes using a medieval pike, part spear, part axe. And no plot string in this story is simple.Episode 3: ""The Magdalen Martyrs""Young Damian Flood is shot in the head while eating his supper. No witnesses, a clean kill with a silencer. An execution. Cody is eager to start investigating the death. Jack knows better; the cops will not welcome their interference.Instead, Jack goes to meet Maggie McCarthy for a finders job. Her Mom, plagued by depression and rages, had died the week before. Maggie found her mom's 50 year-old diary, from her days in a Magdalene Laundry. ""Six years she spent in there, 1960-1966. And every day was a torture.... There was one nun in particular. Mom never mentions her by name in the diary, but the girls called her 'Lucifer'.""Find out who Lucifer was, she asks Jack. She loans him her mother's diary, ""the only thing she left me.""Jack tells her, ""I'll guard it with my life.""He has no idea how true that will be. Someone else wants that diary, too. And why is another Flood boy shot?This is an intense story, told with flashbacks to the Magdalen Laundry. The story's Lucifer is fictional, but there are allegations of sexual, physical and verbal abuse at the real-life laundries. The last one wasn't shut down until the 1990's, and in February, 2013, the Irish government made a public apology.Originally airing in 2010, this 3-disc DVD Set 1 has 273 minutes of viewing, shown in 16:9 widescreen, stereo, with English subtitles available. As is noted on the DVD case, ""Jack Taylor"" contains ""coarse language and violence"".  There are no extras except a photo gallery for each episode. The series are based on the novels by Ken Bruen, which I haven't read. Bruen won a Shamus Award (given annually by the Private Eye Writers of America) for his first Jack Taylor mystery, ""The Guards"".There is artistic license taken, as with every action series and movie. Most people would do more than groan a little after being hit by a car, for example. But I think the atmosphere of the series is excellently drawn.A very recommended series!",5,Gritty Tales of an Anti-Hero  -  Great Stuff!,1382400000,"10 22, 2013",2013,5737,"['Mysteries', 'are',

Jack Taylor is Ken Bruen's fictional detective/private eye/finder. He has been dismissed from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Irish police) and is now finding things for people in Galway, Ireland. The Irish call their gumshoes ""finders"" since ""private eye"" sounds too much like ""informer""...Three 90-minute films are in this first collection: they were filmed in 2010-2011 and directed by Stuart Orme.""The Guards"" introduces Jack Taylor and is based on the debut series novel by Ken Bruen. After his dismissal from the Garda, Taylor finds refuge in a local boarding house and frequents a nearby pub.  A worried mother hires him to find her missing 18-year-old daughter after a series of apparent suicides have left four young girls drugged and drowned in Galway Bay. Taylor receives some assistance from a fellow Garda named Kate Noonan and Superintendent Clancy (Frank O'Sullivan).""The Pikemen"" is a yarn written in Bruen's Hibernian noir style and characterization. It is a typical vigilante story about eight men who wear black hoods, kill with pikes, and have a twisted sense of who deserves to live and who deserves to die. The story includes a nave young man Cody Farraher who sees Jack as a hero, the best ""finder"" in western Ireland.  Taylor is arrested on suspicion of murdering a local businessman and is forced to rely on Cody to help clear his name.""The Magdalen Martyrs"" returns to Bruen's gritty and brutal storytelling and is adapted from his novel of the same name.  Taylor (with Cody's help) is hired to look into past abuses at the infamous Magdalen laundry, the city's home for ""wayward girls.""  The daughter of a former inmate wants him to track down a woman called ""Lucifer""...a particularly brutal nun who worked there in the 1960s. Jack discovers a 50-year-old family secret that leads him to the nun's identity and an unexpected connection to the recent deaths of two brothers.Jack Taylor in the Bruen books is a loner...just an alcoholic Galway gumshoe who finds tinkers and Mary Magdalen's and flops often in his room at a local boarding house.  Iain Glen, although a Scotsman, gets his t'inks and t'anks pronounced in good Irish fashion and, thanks to other surrounding cast members, portrays Taylor well.  The addition of young Cody Farraher (Killian Scott) and beautiful wide-eyed Garda Kate Noonan (Nora-Jane Noone) as regulars in the series is very nice.  Even Mrs. Bailey, the owner of the boarding house and an example of the ""old school of Galway charm,"" softens our intrepid ex-Garda loner.Galwegian Ken Bruen sets his Jack Taylor books smack in the middle of Galway, Ireland.  The settings of the television productions purport to be Ireland but are filmed a goodly bit in Bremen, Germany.  Jack does not sober up and wander down to the Great Southern Hotel (now the Meyrick Hotel) near Eyre Square nor to the greatest bookstore in the world (Kenny's) around the corner on High Street.  But many of the scenes are filmed in Galway's Claddagh area where the Corrib River runs into Galway Bay and are spectacular.Fortunately, the third film in this collection is pure Bruen...and the dialogue is sharp, swift, and blackly comic.  Too bad one has to sit through three hours of introduction and a boring vigilante tale to discover the ""real"" Bruen.

1637737,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,B00BQXTCVS,J. B. Hoyos,"[1, 2]","Please tell me that ACORN TV is planning on producing more episodes of the Jack Taylor television series.  I love reading mystery novels, especially those set throughout Europe.  I've read Irish noir written by Stuart Neville (""The Ghosts of Belfast,"" ""Collusion,"" and ""Stolen Souls"").  All of Neville's Jack Lennon books were excellent, intriguing reads that capture the political and economical turmoil of Northern Ireland.  This same turmoil and pathos can be found in the Jack Taylor series, based on the best-selling novels of Ken Bruen.Jack Taylor, Set 1, contains three episodes, each one approximately ninety minutes and each one having its own disc.  The aspect ratio of each is 1.85:1 and has been formatted for a widescreen television.  Subtitles have been provided for those of us, like myself, who are hearing impaired or have difficulty understanding the characters' Irish brogue.  I've seen other films set in Ireland and the scenes looked similar to those in Jack Taylor.  I found the acting superb and the scripts extremely intriguing.  I am extremely fascinated by serial killers and each episode involved a serial killer committing heinous crimes.I love the characterization in the Jack Taylor series.  The lead character, Jack Taylor (Iain Glen) himself, is very flawed, having once been a member of the Guard but was fired for punching out a superior officer in front of the Prime Minister.  He has a hot temper and a drinking problem.  He now looks for missing persons in Galway, Ireland.  He is assisted by two young people.  The first is a female member of the Guard, Kate Noonan (Nora Jane-Noone), who also sings in a local pub.  The other is a teenage boy, Cody Farraher (Killian Scott), who looks upon Jack Taylor as his role model.  Jack is the father Cody never had; Cody is the son Jack never had.  The relationships between these three people glow closer as the series progresses.In the first episode, ""The Guards,"" Jack Taylor is looking for a missing girl whose disappearance may be connected to a rash of drowning suicides of young girls.  The second episode, ""The Pikemen,"" involves vigilante justice that destroys a family.  The third episode, my favorite, ""The Magdalen Martyrs"" involves a search for vengeance on behalf of those innocent girls who were abused by an insane nun, nicknamed ""Lucifer.""  Certain viewers may find this episode anti-Catholic or anti-Christian.  I just found it very disturbing.  Some of the cruelest people I've encountered in my life attended church; however some of the nicest people I've known also attended church.  Who I choose for my thoughts to dwell upon and to influence my actions is up to me.All three episodes are brutal, bloody and very intriguing.  The plots are complex but not too complicated; I could easily follow them.  The third one, ""The Magdalen Martyrs"" was the most emotional storyline for me.  I became very teary eyed towards the end.  There is a disturbing scene of betrayal and rejection.  This episode explains why Jack Taylor's mom often appears so cold, cruel and distant towards him.  When Jack learns about his mom's abuse at the hands of Lucifer I think he finally finds it in his heart to forgive her.  Iain Glen deserves an award for his performance in Jack Taylor.  I only pray that ACORN TV will release more episodes on DVD and Blu-Ray.Joseph B.

1637738,A1O97WKID9L3IA,B00BQXTCVS,"Jeff Wignall ""Photographer, Author and Radio ...","[0, 1]","Oh I so wanted to really love this series. I love private eye books/films and this just seemed so perfect: the interesting area of Galway, Ireland as a backdrop, a former Irish Guard as the lead character, a great lead actor. But while I really wanted to just become a raving fan of this series, all I can truthfully say is that the episodes are pretty good--but they have some flaws.First of all, the series is about a former Irish Guard (I had to look that up on Wikipedia to find out the significance--and it's worth reading about that organization if you're going to watch this series) named Jack Taylor. Taylor was tossed out of the force and seems to have made more than his share of enemies, both in and out of the Guard, along the way. The anger between him and his former partner (and now a supervisor of some kind) seems a bit contrived to me and it seems like it was just inserted to create tension between the protagonist and his past. OK, that's a common device, I have no real problem with it, but the writers just beat it to death in each of these three episodes. It gets a little tiring. (There's a kind of long-running thing about a coat he never returned when he was tossed from the Guard that I still don't get the importance of--big deal, he stole a coat, who cares! Move on.) Also, is there a private eye in existence that doesn't have a drinking problem? Can someone invent a new problem for one of them?There are three full episodes in this set and, as I said, the backdrop of Galway is pretty interesting. I have never been to Ireland (though I've flown over it, lol) and so to see a city like this as a backdrop is fun. Also, Iain Glen is a superb actor (and it's to his credit that I'm giving this set four stars instead of three--his acting is great) and he really has created a deeply believable character.So what is the source of my overall disappointment? Mostly it's the writing. In the first episode several young girls turn up drowned (suicides?) in the harbor. Then out of the blue a woman approaches Taylor and says her daughter is missing--but is not among the dead. Can he help her find the daughter? This is where the plot stumbles: first, how did she really find him? There's some nonsense about his artist buddy that makes no sense to me and her seeing a painting of Taylor, etc. Then she hands him a wad of cash for his services--but he doesn't even count it and shoves it in his pocket. What? And then, not long after, he ends up having a romantic entanglement with the mother. It all seems very invented and obvious. The artist/friend becomes a larger element in the plot but the connections between all of the characters just seemed strained to me.The second episode is even more convoluted and unexplained and I nearly shut it off. But in this episode a sidekick named Cody is introduced and, thankfully, he saves the episode (and the series, to be honest). I actually found myself alternately rewinding obsessively to hear what they were saying (thick accents and I hate subtitles) and fast forwarding because the plot was so slow and thick with coincidence.But I stuck with it--and I'm glad that I did. Episode #3 is the winner. This episode explains a lot of Jack's past and his family life (his mother is a major character in this episode), Cody is back and there is a great connection to the Magdalene Sisters--a group of young girls who were essentially turned into slaves and tortured by nuns in Ireland. A fascinating connection to a real (and dark) part of Ireland's history. There was a film made about the Magdalene Sisters:The Magdalene Sistersand it is absolutely worth watching--a difficult film to watch, but brilliant.This episode is great. The actors all have upped their game, the writers seem to have found their pace and the story, as I said, has a strong connection to historical events. I loved this last episode.So, I give the series four stars, though part of me wants to keep it to three. Let's call it 3.5. But Glen is such a superb actor and the last episode is so powerful, that I am giving the series the benefit of the doubt. As one other reviewer said (his review is excellent, by the way), Robert B. Parker's (RIP, Robert) ""Jesse Stone"" series is a far more articulate and engaging series on all counts:Jesse Stone: The Complete SetIs this worth watching? Absolutely, if you like a good mystery and can overlook the flaws (and the thick accents), it's pretty fun. Is it great? No, not even close. But Iain Glen is great--and he's worth watching.",4,"A great lead character, terribly contrived and convoluted plots",1385769600,"11 30, 2013",2013,4522,"['Oh', 'so', 'wanted', 'really', 'love', 'series', 'love', 'private', 'eye', 'books/films', 'just', 'seemed', 'so', 'perfect', 'interesting', 'area', 'Galway', 'Ireland', 'backdrop', 'former', 'Irish', 'Guard', 'lead', 'character', 'great', 'lead', 'actor', 'really', 'wanted', 'just', 'become', 'raving', 'fan', 'series', 'can', 'truthfully', 'say', 'episodes', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'have', 'flaws.First', 'series', 'former', 'Irish', 'Guard', 'had', 'look', 'up', 'Wikipedia', 'find', 'out', 'significance', 'worth', 'reading', 'organization', ""'re"", 'going', 'watch', 'series', 'named', 'Jack', 'Taylor', 'Taylor', 'was', 'tossed', 'force', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'share', 'enemies', 'Guard', 'way', 'anger', 'former', 'partner', 'now', 'supervisor', 'kind', 'bit', 'contrived', 'was', 'just', 'inserted', 'create', 'tension', 'protagonist', 'past', 'OK', 'common', 'device', 'have', 'real', 'problem', 'writers', 'just', 'beat', 'death', 'three', 'episodes', 'little', 'tiring', 'kind', 'long-running', 'thing', 'coat', 'never', 'returned', 'when', 'was', 'tossed', 'Guard', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'importance', 'big', 'deal', 'stole', 'coat', 'who', 'Move', 'Also', 'there', 'private', 'eye', 'existence', ""n't"", 'have', 'drinking', 'problem', 'Can', 'someone', 'invent', 'new', 'problem', 'one', 'are', 'three', 'full', 'episodes', 'set', 'said', 'backdrop', 'Galway', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'Ireland', ""'ve"", 'flown', 'so', 'see', 'city', 'backdrop', 'fun', 'Also', 'Iain', 'Glen', 'superb', 'actor', 'credit', ""'m"", 'giving', 'set', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'three', 'acting', 'great', 'really', 'created', 'deeply', 'believable', 'character.So', 'what', 'source', 'overall', 'disappointment', 'Mostly', 'writing', 'first', 'episode', 'several', 'young', 'girls', 'turn', 'up', 'drowned', 'suicides', 'harbor', 'Then', 'blue', 'woman', 'Taylor', 'daughter', 'missing', 'not', 'dead', 'Can', 'help', 'find', 'daughter', 'where', 'plot', 'stumbles', 'first', 'how', 'did', 'really', 'find', 'nonsense', 'artist', 'buddy', 'sense', 'seeing', 'painting', 'Taylor', 'etc', 'Then', 'wad', 'cash', 'services', ""n't"", 'even', 'count', 'pocket', 'What', 'then', 'not', 'long', 'up', 'having', 'romantic', 'entanglement', 'mother', 'very', 'invented', 'obvious', 'artist/friend', 'larger', 'element', 'plot', 'connections', 'characters', 'just', 'seemed', 'strained', 'me.The', 'second', 'episode', 'even', 'more', 'convoluted', 'unexplained', 'nearly', 'shut', 'off', 'episode', 'sidekick', 'named', 'Cody', 'introduced', 'thankfully', 'episode', 'series', 'be', 'honest', 'actually', 'found', 'alternately', 'rewinding', 'obsessively', 'hear', 'what', 'were', 'saying', 'thick', 'accents', 'hate', 'subtitles', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'plot', 'was', 'so', 'slow', 'thick', 'coincidence.But', 'stuck', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'Episode', '3', 'winner', 'episode', 'lot', 'Jack', 'past', 'family', 'life', 'mother', 'major', 'character', 'episode', 'Cody', 'back', 'great', 'connection', 'Magdalene', 'Sisters', 'group', 'young', 'girls', 'who', 'were', 'essentially', 'turned', 'slaves', 'tortured', 'nuns', 'Ireland', 'A', 'fascinating', 'connection', 'real', 'dark', 'part', 'Ireland', 'history', 'was', 'film', 'made', 'Magdalene', 'Sisters', 'Magdalene', 'Sistersand', 'absolutely', 'worth', 'watching', 'difficult', 'film', 'watch', 'brilliant.This', 'episode', 'great', 'actors', 'have', 'upped', 'game', 'writers', 'seem', 'have', 'found', 'pace', 'story', 'said', 'strong', 'connection', 'historical', 'events', 'loved', 'last', 'episode.So', 'give', 'series', 'four', 'stars', 'part', 'keep', 'three', 'Let', 'call', '3.5', 'Glen', 'such', 'superb', 'actor', 'last', 'episode', 'so', 'powerful', 'am', 'giving', 'series', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'one', 'other', 'reviewer', 'said', 'review', 'excellent', 'way', 'Robert', 'B.', 'Parker', 'RIP', 'Robert', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'series', 'far', 'more', 'articulate', 'engaging', 'series', 'counts', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'Complete', 'SetIs', 'worth', 'watching', 'Absolutely', 'like', 'good', 'mystery', 'can', 'overlook', 'flaws', 'thick', 'accents', 'pretty', 'fun', 'great', 'No', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'Iain', 'Glen', 'great', 'worth', 'watching']","JACK TAYLOR, SET 1"

The beautiful Galway scenery co-stars in this series, and several of the supporting cast turn in admirable performances. Some of the plots follow a predictable path, but somehow the charm of the Irish makes them new and fresh. Jack angered the local constable, had a loyal sidekick, got beat up in every series, and had difficulty relating to his women friends, but there was always a plot twist at the end. The twists made the show entertaining; however the fact that Jack seems to get badly beaten up in every episode but seems to bounce back by the end of each story strains credibility.

Even the Irish setting (which does add a lot of colour and character) has been explored before (Single Handed). So what is it that distinguishes Taylor from so many other purveyors of law and order? To be honest, I&#8217;m not sure. This is the problem with JACK TAYLOR.Aside from familiarity there is the added problem that Jack Taylor isn&#8217;t particularly likeable, especially when he makes sexually suggestive remarks to teenaged schoolgirls. The whole beaten-down-by-the-world, poetically tragic Irishman would get tiresome very quickly were it not for the lynchpin performance of Iain Glen (who is actually Scottish). Glen is a handsome man playing against his looks and for that alone he deserves considerable credit. It&#8217;s the character that counts, flawed though he may be.The stories are good, with excellent production values and supporting performances. If there is a problem with JACK TAYLOR it is simply that there are an awful lot of policemen/detectives on TV and to stand out there needs to be something to distinguish the main actor and the premise of the show from all the others. I&#8217;m not sure I even LIKE Jack Taylor.There is something interesting about the man and his tragic fall (he was a policeman who left the Guard under trying circumstances). He is certainly a flawed hero (if he is, in fact, heroic). About the only qualifications he has for heroism are his honesty and determination to find the truth.Of the three feature-length episodes packaged here, the third, The Magdelen Murders, is by far the best and does the best job of developing Taylor&#8217;s character and explaining his motivations. It is this episode which promises there may be more than was initially on display with this series.The verdict is still out on JACK TAYLOR, but while there may be enough interest to warrant spending more time with him in further episodes, he, and the program that bears his name, are light years away from being in the same league as a Tommy Murphy, George Gently or Tom (or even John) Barnaby.Not all detective shows can be gold.

The story really works as a means of introducing Jack and the world in which he lives.  It also feels oddly separate from the following two tales which are set a year or more after the first.  Basically, Jack was in the Irish police force and got himself kicked out or resigned and then took to drinking.  He has a few shady friends that get him tied into some nasty stuff.  In the end the right people get their just desserts and life goes on.""The Pikemen"" follows Jack on his return to Galway and the trouble he finds himself in when he starts to investigate the death of one of his father's friends son.  Things get complicated for Jack when he finds himself with a partner in the P.I. biz and blamed for a murder he did not commit.  The tension starts slow and burns slow but ramps up courtesy of a well placed chase scene toward the end.  Again, everything ends up more or less hunky dory and life goes on.""The Magadalen Martyrs"" is a bit more personal for Jack than he realizes as he finds out more and more about the past of several women tied to a church run laundry.  Things go quickly south and Jack finds himself in the most trouble he's been in to date.  Of the three this is the hardest to take at times but also the most riveting.There are good and less than good moments in the series.  The first episode feels oddly disconnected after viewing the following episodes.  The last two are certainly more interesting but no less gruesome at times.  Jack Taylor is a well done series, though.  Iain Glen is really good as the title character, moody and brash enough while also being convincingly boozy.

Now other networks have started mimicking this pattern, first used by the ""NBC Mystery Movie"" but largely abandoned on American TV, of letting longer episodes tell darker, more character-driven stories. This lets creative teams tell richer stories without the pressure of a full series. From Ireland's TV3 we get: Jack Taylor.""Galway is the graveyard of ambition."" So moans Jack Taylor (Iain Glen, latterly of A Game of Thrones) in the first of three movies in this collection. A veteran police officer, Taylor loses his commission in the opening scenes, which only cements his violently self-destructive tendencies. After years spent defending justice, he's realized police work's dirtiest secret: you can't work around that much crime for that long without getting some of it on you.These three movies, each give-or-take ninety minutes, unpack some new chapter in Taylor's ongoing odyssey. Each begins when somebody needs Taylor to find something: a missing daughter, the truth behind an apparent suicide, the name behind a nameless family secret. But tiny Galway doesn't harbor a million stories in its naked streets; everybody's mam knew everybody else's secret lover, and everything inevitably proves connected to Taylor himself.Galway, Ireland, is about the size of Schenectady, New York, and about equally disconnected from life's exciting corners. Sometimes considered a local hero, Taylor does pickup work to subsidize his liquor habit. But Taylor is both an inelegant drunk and a haphazard gumshoe, prone to booze snoozes through important clues, and getting ambushed during stakeouts. Sam Spade he ain't. Yet he perseveres, because his own criminal instincts make him a champion crimefighter.The story sounds familiar to hardboiled thriller devotees, yet its producers redeem it from comfy companionship by its format. We witness Taylor's drawn-out implosion in excruciating detail, but as his love of poteen and tendency to sleep with wrong women forms patterns, we realize he wouldn't be any good at his job if he didn't destroy himself thus. Taylor beats criminals because he thinks like a criminal. Good thing, too, because his unorthodox approach, straddling the legal fence, alienates his former police colleagues.This series appropriates shopworn crime noir standards, like the hero's repressed anger and voiceover narration, and reorganizes them so that what feels familiar at first, even old had, becomes new. The familiarity we think we feel is an illusion. As happens to Taylor, these movies have a way of lulling us into false relaxation, then punching us so vigorously that nothing seems the same.

1637747,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00BQXTCVS,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","The primary draw to this collection of Irish made-for-TV movies is the great character actor Iain Glen. While I've seen Glen in dozens of projects, he is currently starring in HBO's stellar adaptation of &#34;Game of Thrones.&#34; As the right hand of Daenerys Targaryen (EMMY nominee Emilia Clarke), he has miraculously lasted three seasons without meeting a beheading or other violent end! No small accomplishment there! &#34;Jack Taylor&#34; is, as I mentioned, a series of movies that started in 2010. The Set One DVD release collects the three earliest works: The Guards, The Pikemen, and The Magdalen Martyrs. There have been two others that have already aired overseas (The Dramatist and Priest) with four more on the decks (The Killing of The Tinkers, Cross, Sanctuary and The Devil). Therefore, it appears that a Set Two and Set Three might be on their way in the future. So if you love the Jack Taylor films (and enough people buy the DVD), there are more adventures in the offing.I watch a lot of international TV, especially crime drama, and it's such an overcrowded field that it has become virtually impossible to tell new or intriguing stories. &#34;Jack Taylor&#34; is adapted from the novels of Ken Bruen and in addition to the presence of Glen, it offers two other unique selling points: The individual plots are appropriately twisty and the series benefits from a real sense of location. Set mostly in Galway, the township and its inhabitants figure prominently into the success of the franchise. This is gritty stuff. A disgraced cop, Taylor leads a troubled life straddling between the law enforcement community and the seamier underbelly of polite society. Taylor takes on cases that the police ignore, and this leads to many confrontations from just about every angle. As the series begins with The Guards, I absolutely loathed the first hour of the movie. Trying too hard to establish Taylor as a flippant troublemaker, the set-up seemed incredibly scripted and inexcusably false. The tone was too light, too irreverent, and I didn't believe Jack Taylor as a real person but as an eccentric narrative construct. Although it got better in the second half, I probably wouldn't have watched the other movies were they not provided in the set. Luckily I did, though, because I did find them ultimately satisfying. And if you're a fan of Glen or crime drama, I would recommend this overall.The Guards (2010) 2 1/2 Stars: Dealing with a series of local drownings, Jack is enlisted to help a distressed woman with a missing daughter. The Guards (the police who have dismissed Jack from service) seem to be ineffective and the woman may not be telling the whole truth. The more Jack uncovers, the more danger he is in. As he suffers a very personal loss, the investigation leads to some well connected suspects and a number of dark revelations. I actually quite enjoyed the plot of this one, I just couldn't stand the way the character was introduced in the first half.The Pikemen (2011) 4 Stars: Jack, operating outside the law himself, comes across a mysterious band of vigilantes. A former friend of his father asks for help after his son dies in mysterious circumstances (not so mysterious for the viewer really, we see it at the opening of the movie). It becomes a race to determine who might be next on the hit list, and it is left to Jack to unravel a darker conspiracy with very personal motives. This was a solid entry, although Jack's ruminations about his father didn't add a whole lot to the tale. But adding a sidekick was a winning stroke.The Magdalen Martyrs (2011) 4 Stars: In a blast from the past, Jack's new case is tied to the notorious Magdalen Laundries (Basically a work camp/prison for young girls). A woman whose mother has recently passed wants to locate the sadistic nun that her mother has written about in her girlhood journals. These rather innocuous requests seem to garner a lot of attention. What kind of cover-up is there? And why is everyone interested in the journal? As Jack digs deeper, this one also strikes rather close to home. There is a bit too much coincidence in the revelations here, but I think this is easily the best of the bunch as it has real emotional resonance.

1637749,A30IP5D5DLHRPA,B00BQXTCVS,Kyle Slayzar,"[2, 4]","Before every fan swarms me with negativity for giving 3/5 stars, let me give up a disclaimer and say that I was unaware of a Jack Taylor literary character, let alone TV film series, before having the opportunity to review the first movie set.  I do not know anything about the books but, as I learned after seeing Ender's Game in at the cinema today without having read the print version, the books should not matter to the general audience as just the movie need to be good (enjoyed Ender's Game BTW).  I have seen other made-for-TV films from crime novels, most notably the Jesse Stone films and enjoyed every one of them so that's the closest comparison I have.Now, I'm going to be brutally honest: I only made it through the first film, half-way through the second, and couldn't go any further from there.  Between the poor pacing, confusing narration, and the film taking the bold step of not including the audience in some of the detective deductions, the audience I was watching with and myself just couldn't justify spending another two hours or so watching the last half of The Pikemen and starting/finishing The Magdelan Martyrs.  I thought it would be great for review purposes if I brought in my parents, little brother ( aged 24), his girlfriend, and two buddies of mine to spend a whole evening eating popcorn and watching a Jack Taylor marathon as every person in the room had very unique tastes and standards.  However, despite the eclectic tastes surrounding the man cave that is the theater room we all, universally, found the series confusing and my parents fell asleep.Here's why we didn't like it.The pacing was atrocious.  It felt as though more time was being spent with minor details or by driving home Taylor's drinking habits too much (we get it!  He's a drunkard!).  The films also tend to make tremendous deduction jumps without explaining them.  For instance, Taylor is investigating the disappearance of a girl and makes a tremendous leap of faith from having little luck while doing leg work and checking the word on the street to seeing girls with matching tote bags sporting a local company logo and *light bulb* SOMETHING SINISTER even though the girls he interviews that he made the evil corporation connection with didn't even know the girl who vanished.  I remember I had to pause the film because my brother spoke up and said, ""WTF, how'd he make THAT connection?!""  We all then tried to figure it out ourselves and, believing it would be better explained later on, resumed the film.  While Taylor's assertion was correct, his deduction wasn't explained leaving us completely baffled.  Taylor made other deductions from almost nothing throughout the film and didn't have the common courtesy to explain things even in the overly done narration, which gave more philosophical zing-zangers than moving the plot along.  If anything, the narration made the films harder to follow.Both films we watched, albeit did not finish the second one, continued to hopscotch throughout the plot and make very loosed connection that just baffled us and it wasn't due to our inability to fully understand the Irish accent, either.  We were able to understand enough of what the actors were trying to say, and they did a good job in their portrayals, but nothing they said helped alleviate our confusion.  It's like reading a crime novel with whole chapters missing and not even the boring ones but the ones integral to the plot.  It made the films unwatchable.Now, this next section covers the seemingly fundamental flaws in the plots themselves.  Throughout the films, when our whole audience was awake and coherent, many of us made various observations of obvious plot holes and unlikely character actions.  Now, granted, I've never been to Ireland and I know next to nothing about their culture and customs, but I'd like to think that some things are common sense such as...1:  Evil corporate bossman has cameras everywhere in his plant to 'watch' his workers and uses them constantly, except on his outside doors when Taylor and psychotic drinking buddy break in at night2:  In same evil corporate HQ of devil worshipers, the bossman of pure evil employs off-duty cops for security and even has them attack Taylor to shut him up... except for aforementioned scene where Taylor and friend break in and confront the former BP executive that probably clubs baby seals for fun.  Now, if I were an evil corporate dictator that ran a sweatshop for young girls and other criminal activities that I won't discuss to reveal the plot, I would have security there at ALL HOURS!  Hell, even the local Super Target has a asset protection security officer monitor cameras when the store is closed.  Not to mention everyone else seems to have a gun in Ireland except the bad guys.  Villains in the Jack Taylor universe need to stop watching Saturday morning cartoons and invest a little illegal money in some good ol' fashioned firearms and a full-time private security force.3:  Jack Taylor, after hearing grave news about a friend, goes on an evening drinking binge and wakes up a few days later.  Now, I'm no doctor but I've NEVER heard of a person passing out for more then 12 hours unless they had alcohol poisoning and that would require immediate medical attention.  Taylor would not have been out as long as he was unless his mother's remedy for drunkenness was Ambien.4:  At the very beginning, Taylor sports a navy double-button overcoat that, apparently, he got as a cop and never returned.  The superintendent and local ""guard"" office send him numerous notes reminding him to return the coat in an almost running gag.  Now, at one point Taylor is passed out in his apartment and his former partner, now superintendent, shows up to talk to him but not before looking at the coat hung up on the wall and mentions, ""I'll start by taking this back,"" but he never takes the coat but makes repeated efforts to try and take it back (unsuccessfully) later.  Maybe he forgot, but I was expecting a subplot of Taylor trying to get it back and, when I saw Taylor sporting the coat in the next scene, I knew that wasn't going to happen.I can go on, but I'll wait for the Cinema Sins video and you get the idea.After we gave the film series a rest, we conversed about what we thought and not one of us enjoyed them.  They were boring, put some of us to sleep, and made too many jumps without explaining them to the audience.  I was ready for nonsensical exposition at that point!From the general audience perspective, this isn't a very good series as I would recommend Jesse Stone films instead.  To fans, I'm sure they're fun but, to the rest of us, the books don't/shouldn't matter.",3,Lost (Somewhat) in Translation: A Review from the General Audience,1385596800,"11 28,

1637750,A3CSDBDV77Z0VI,B00BQXTCVS,lily t.,"[0, 0]","I saw the first episode a while ago and didn't like the program--it seemed contrived and cliched. However my sister, a fan of the series, urged me to keep going and I'm happy that I did.First let me say that I can't think of a more versatile actor working today than Iain Glen. From Lordly to louche, he seems to be able to inhabit all sorts of characters. As Jack Taylor, a former policeman in the Irish Guards turned private investigator, even the timbre of his voice seems to have changed along with his accent--and is redolent of booze and cigarettes. Taylor has a lot of wounds stemming from childhood--and as he says at one point, 'I'm an Irish male, I deal with things by repressing them.' And by drinking like a fish.In the first episode Taylor gets involved with a beautiful femme fatale [ who hires him to find her daughter] after he is fired from the Gardai for assaulting a local politician.In the second, returning from a years absence to Galway he gets involved in an investigation surrounding the suspicious death of a man who has fallen off a building site and finds himself pursued both by the police and a vigilante group run amok. Along the way he picks up an enthusiastic young sidekick.The third episode is best, involving gross abuses in a Magdalene laundry facility where young women were interned, and during which the hidden past touches Taylor's life in a most personal way. Unlike some viewers, I did not find the events to be contrived or too coincidental --I always enjoy stories where lives cross and crisscross and seemingly random events turn out to be intertwined [ I looked up Galway and the population is about 77,000 --so it is not inconceivable that many people's paths have converged at some point].Interesting locations, good supporting cast and another stand out characterization/ performance by Glen. If you only know him from Game of Thrones and Downton Abbey, check out his earlier work in the incredible Bob Raphelson film Mountains of the Moon about the Burton-Speke expedition to discover the source of the Nile; as an intellectual gay drug addict in Painted Lady and as a gangster in Prisoner's Wives.

He has a soft heart for the underdog.He doesn't play by the rules, but he's effective.

Aiding him is an attractive and smart female cop, a sympathetic chief of police who cuts him slack when he can, and he teams up with a fun and smart sidekick in episode two. He also has a very understanding landlady. The dialogue is colorful and witty.

Another cliche is that with the exception of Kate, all the Gardai officers are depicted as either corrupt or a dimwits who need old Jack to somehow solve the case for them...and who inevitably tell Kate to ""stay away from Jack Taylor"" ...which she never does.So I would rate it a solid three stars...which translates in my book to being a good time waster but it doesn't rise to the same level as police and private detective series like Midsomer Murders, Touch of Frost, Inspector Lynley, Morse, Inspector Lewis, and Poirot.",3,Some Good and Some Bad,1378944000,"09 12, 2013",2013,1542,"['Probably', 'best', 'thing', 'Jack', 'Taylor', 'going', 'Iain', 'Glenn', 'great', 'actor', 'very', 'believable', 'charismatic', 'gruff', 'ex-Gardai', 'turned', 'finder', 'apparent', 'term', 'private', 'detective', 'Ireland', 'Other', 'pluses', 'include', 'beautiful', 'Galway', 'scenery', 'supporting', 'cast', 'very', 'appealing', 'Nora-Jane', 'Noone', 'who', 'Kate', 'one', 'Jack', 'Gardai', 'friends', 'potential', 'love', 'interest', 'cinematography', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'done.But', 'what', 'keeps', 'giving', 'more', 'three', 'stars', 'fact', 'plots', 'are', 'very', 'predictable', 'rarely', 'spring', 'surprises', 'viewer', ""'ve"", 'been', 'done', 'death', 'cop', 'private', 'detective', 'shows', 'US', 'UK', 'only', 'thing', 'new', 'fact', 'everyone', 'here', 'speaking', 'Irish', 'accents.Also', 'certain', 'things', 'happen', 'strain', 'belief', 'Jack', 'getting', 'badly', 'beaten', 'up', 'what', 'episode', 'once', 'hit', 'car', 'being', 'pretty', 'much', 'good', 'new', 'end', 'story', 'cliche', 'exception', 'Kate', 'Gardai', 'officers', 'are', 'depicted', 'corrupt', 'dimwits', 'who', 'need', 'old', 'Jack', 'somehow', 'solve', 'case', 'who', 'inevitably', 'tell', 'Kate', 'stay', 'away', 'Jack', 'Taylor', 'never', 'does.So', 'would', 'rate', 'solid', 'three', 'stars', 'book', 'being', 'good', 'time', 'waster', ""n't"", 'rise', 'same', 'level', 'police', 'private', 'detective', 'series', 'Midsomer', 'Murders', 'Touch', 'Frost', 'Inspector', 'Lynley', 'Morse', 'Inspector', 'Lewis', 'Poirot']","JACK TAYLOR, SET 1"

1637758,AT0E6UBVJMJ6W,B00BQXTCVS,Ms Winston,"[1, 3]","I did not immediately recognize the star of ""Jack Taylor,"" Scottish actor Iain Glen, as I do not have premium cable to watch ""Game of Thrones,"" and he was much ""cleaned up"" for his role in ""Downton Abbey"" as one of Lady Mary's rich suitors. In the ""Jack Taylor"" series he looks very seedy and dissipated as a former Guarda (police officer) now working as a finder, or private detective, in Galway, Ireland. Jack hits the bottle very hard several times in the first of the three movies alone (""The Guards""), and confides to a new lover that he has a self destruction button that he hits on his own when women get too close emotionally. We find out that both his father and brother are dead and that he is estranged from his disapproving mother. His drinking and his temper got him canned from the police force, although he keeps his distinctive Guarda greatcoat, and has contact with both a hostile superior and a young female officer.All three of the feature length movies were very entertaining. The movies are more character-driven than plot driven, although the plots are fairly easy to follow, unlike a similar series from Australia entitled ""Jack Irish,"" where it was totally necessary to use the subtitles, not only to understand the accents but to follow the story line. For ""Jack Taylor"" I still used the subtitles but I think I could have gotten by without them if they had not been available. The movies were partially shot in Ireland and also on the continent, although I am not familiar with Galway so I have no idea which scenes were shot where. The biggest weakness of the first film (""The Guards"") was figuring the relationship between the artist who painted a distinctive portrait of Jack and Jack himself. It was a strange relationship that Jack admitted was partly based upon his fascination with the ""dark side"" of his quasi-friend. And there is one clue that simply slipped by me that had to do with the name of the company that was involved with the serial murders of female employees. But, as in so many films of this type, one can just sit back and ignore plot elements that don't always make sense. My favorite of the three films is ""The Magdalen Martyrs,"" which deals with the Catholic church, always a presence in Ireland.A few male friends and family members have remarked that they don't understand the attraction that a Jack Taylor has for women -- he is unshaven for most of the scenes, his hair is a mess, his face is heavily lined, and he probably smells of booze (and who knows when that coat ever gets to the cleaners!). This is one of those mysteries of life that cannot be explained in rational terms, as the character of Jack Irish was very similiar, as is Boyd Crowder in ""Justified."" For whatever reason, these men are some sort of chick magnets even though it would seem that everything is against them. I think it is the same thing as the women who love romance novels where the hero is considered a ""bad boy"": the lure of the chase to tame that wild man, whom they are convinced has a heart of gold under the messy exterior. In the case of the two Jacks (Taylor and Irish) it is clear that under the wild man looks they are at heart decent and caring human beings. I think that is why these series have such appeal, and we are rooting for them.",4,Exciting and Entertaining!,1384041600,"11 10, 2013",2013,3286,"['did', 'not', 'immediately', 'recognize', 'star', 'Jack', 'Taylor', 'Scottish', 'actor', 'Iain', 'Glen', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'premium', 'cable', 'watch', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'was', 'much', 'cleaned', 'up', 'role', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'one', 'Lady', 'Mary', 'rich', 'suitors', 'Jack', 'Taylor', 'series', 'very', 'seedy', 'dissipated', 'former', 'Guarda', 'police', 'officer', 'now', 'working', 'finder', 'private', 'detective', 'Galway', 'Ireland', 'Jack', 'bottle', 'very', 'hard', 'several', 'times', 'first', 'three', 'movies', 'alone', 'Guards', 'confides', 'new', 'lover', 'self', 'destruction', 'button', 'own', 'when', 'women', 'get', 'too', 'close', 'emotionally', 'find', 'out', 'father', 'brother', 'are', 'dead', 'estranged', 'disapproving', 'mother', 'drinking', 'temper', 'got', 'canned', 'police', 'force', 'distinctive', 'Guarda', 'greatcoat', 'contact', 'hostile', 'superior', 'young', 'female', 'officer.All', 'three', 'feature', 'length', 'movies', 'were', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movies', 'are', 'more', 'character-driven', 'plot', 'driven', 'plots', 'are', 'fairly', 'easy', 'follow', 'similar', 'series', 'Australia', 'entitled', 'Jack', 'Irish', 'where', 'was', 'totally', 'necessary', 'use', 'subtitles', 'not', 'only', 'understand', 'accents', 'follow', 'story', 'line', 'Jack', 'Taylor', 'still', 'used', 'subtitles', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'available', 'movies', 'were', 'partially', 'shot', 'Ireland', 'also', 'continent', 'am', 'not', 'familiar', 'Galway', 'have', 'idea', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'where', 'biggest', 'weakness', 'first', 'film', 'Guards', 'was', 'figuring', 'relationship', 'artist', 'who', 'painted', 'distinctive', 'portrait', 'Jack', 'Jack', 'was', 'strange', 'relationship', 'Jack', 'admitted', 'was', 'partly', 'based', 'fascination', 'dark', 'side', 'quasi-friend', 'one', 'clue', 'simply', 'slipped', 'had', 'do', 'name', 'company', 'was', 'involved', 'serial', 'murders', 'female', 'employees', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'type', 'one', 'can', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'ignore', 'plot', 'elements', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'sense', 'favorite', 'three', 'films', 'Magdalen', 'Martyrs', 'Catholic', 'church', 'always', 'presence', 'Ireland.A', 'few', 'male', 'friends', 'family', 'members', 'have', 'remarked', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'attraction', 'Jack', 'Taylor', 'women', 'unshaven', 'most', 'scenes', 'hair', 'mess', 'face', 'heavily', 'lined', 'probably', 'booze', 'who', 'when', 'coat', 'ever', 'cleaners', 'one', 'mysteries', 'life', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'explained', 'rational', 'terms', 'character', 'Jack', 'Irish', 'was', 'very', 'similiar', 'Boyd', 'Crowder', 'Justified', 'reason', 'men', 'are', 'sort', 'chick', 'magnets', 'even', 'would', 'seem', 'everything', 'think', 'same', 'thing', 'women', 'who', 'love', 'romance', 'novels', 'where', 'hero', 'considered', 'bad', 'boy', 'lure', 'chase', 'tame', 'wild', 'man', 'whom', 'are', 'convinced', 'heart', 'gold', 'messy', 'exterior', 'case', 'two', 'Jacks', 'Taylor', 'Irish', 'clear', 'wild', 'man', 'are', 'heart', 'decent', 'caring', 'human', 'beings', 'think', 'why', 'series', 'have', 'such', 'appeal', 'are', 'rooting']","JACK TAYLOR, SET 1"

In the first episode, ""The Guards,"" Taylor is hired to find a woman's missing daughter. What he uncovers is a string of missing young women and several people willing to kill to cover up the truth. In ""The Pikemen,"" a Taylor takes on a group of vigilantes, notably one man and his son (who is conflicted over his role in the vigilantism). In ""The Magdalen Martyrs,"" Taylor is asked to track down a former nun nicknamed ""Lucifer"" for the brutality she practiced against ""wayward girls"" in a home for such girls.Iain Glen is compelling as Taylor, the walking clich&eacute; who somehow manages not to seem like too much of a clich&eacute;. He has a drinking problem, has difficulty with authority, and seems to have an ambiguous moral code (while still being on the right side). His romantic and emotional entanglements, too, are stock. Still, the complex plots and the acting overcome these flaws.Prior to seeing these three episodes, I had not seen the series or red Ken Bruen's books, on which the series is based. I enjoyed these three 90-minute episodes, but I can't say that I'd be likely to last too long unless the plot elements change. Here, they're fairly straightforward: Taylor reluctantly takes a case, his methods land him in trouble with both the local authorities and the criminals, he is attacked, he alienates those who trust him, and he ultimately figures things out and restores order.

The troubled ex-cop working as a sort of undercover private investigator while battling his own demons is always a grand plot for a crime noir series.  Having never even heard of the series I went into it as a blank slate.I did enjoy much of the acting - I find Iain Glen to be superb in the role of the title character Jack Taylor.  Many of the secondary characters are fairly well acted though not up to par with his performance.  I did find that some of the lesser parts were overacted as if they were cast from the local theater without tempering the performance for film.The scenery is beautiful and very interesting to watch (It's nice to see things that don't take place in NYC or LA every once in a while).The directing is good though not stellar.  The writing is 75% of the way there... each episode you will find characters talking in a more literary fashion than an actual dialog fashion - which brings me to what I liked the least... the Voice overs.  I found them for the most part to be completely unnecessary and detracted quite a bit from the actual story telling.This series includes three DVD's with a full length episode (the length of a film) on each.  Apparently there were more episodes in the season but only the first three are included here.  I'm assuming there will be a set 2 with the missing episodes.If you haven't seen the series each episode is essentially a full length film following Jack Taylor as he investigates and solves a series of murders that the local cops don't seem to be able to get a handle on.  He does it through manhandling the filthier end of society and drinking his way through his problems.  The victims he champions tend to be people the rest of society either looks down upon or simply forgets exists.  True to the genera there are several red herrings and the actual baddie isn't discovered until the end though he has often been there all along.  The series is dark, gritty and not for the kiddies, the stories are interesting though not exactly new material.

1637773,A2UYGOYMV73826,B00BQXTCVS,Rushmore,"[0, 1]","This is a set of 3 90-minute TV movies about a private detective in Galway.  Jack Taylor is a very dark character.  He left the Garda under a cloud and is now making a tenuous living as a ""finder"" or private detective.  His late father Paddy was a football star, revered by most.  Jack keeps his feelings about his dad pretty close to the vest.  His relationship with his mother is strained to say the least.  He is a 40-something burnout, living on alcohol and cigarettes.  His true family consists basically of the publican of the moment, his young sidekick Cody, and Kate Noonan, a young Garda officer who can always be relied on to put her beloved career on the line to help Jack on his current case.Jack's back story comes out gradually over the course of these three episodes, and at the end of this set there are a lot of unanswered questions.  Iain Glen's performance as Jack is riveting.  According to the credits he appeared on Downton Abbey.  I certainly did not recognize him - he played Richard Carlisle, the newspaper publisher who almost blackmailed Mary into marrying him to protect her dirty little secret.  Jack Taylor is a much more nuanced character, intimate with his own demons.  He does not shy away from confrontation.  He does not respect authority but curiously seems to have a lot of respect for older people (except for his own parents and the clergy).Two relationships between Jack and younger people take center stage.  Cody is basically a fanboy who persuades Jack that they should work together.  Their dialogue provides much needed comic relief in these very dark tales.  Kate is more enigmatic.  She knows Jack is bad news for her career.  In case she should ever forget, her superiors continually remind her.  Yet she never hesitates to help him however she can, crossing legal and ethical lines as needed.  There may be a wisp of sexual attraction, although she is young enough to be his daughter.I highly recommend watching these shows with the subtitles turned on.  Some of the dialogue is pretty great and you don't want to miss any of it.  I also like the use of voiceover narration by Jack - these segments tell us more about him than the dialogue or action sequences.This misses the mark of a 5-star recommendation mainly because Jack is basically the Energizer Bunny.  While other characters are killed off at an alarming rate, Jack can survive pretty much anything.  In one sequence, he is hit by a car, then shot, and still manages to save someone's life.This series will not make you want to visit Galway any time soon.  It was cool to recognize some of the settings, but Jack Taylor's Galway is a very menacing place.I do recommend this series.  The shows are haunting and moody.

He does a voice over which explains what he's thinking throughout the movies, it works for really developing the character.The mysteries themselves are dark. The criminals are creepy and disturbed.

Based on the crime novels of Ken Bruen and filmed as 3 feature-length movies rather than a bunch of 1-hour episodes, this set follows the exploits of former Irish Garda officer turned private detective Taylor (Iain Glen) as he goes about delving into mysteries, hitting the bottle, and generally getting into trouble with his former Garda colleagues, especially the young, beautiful Kate Noonan (Nora-Jane Noone), a Garda new to the job that occasionally helps Taylor out when needed.One thing I can definitely say about this series is that it's very fascinating.  From the first movie to the last in this first set, Jack Taylor has the viewer on the edge of his or her seat as he deals with his own personal demons whilst trying to find answers to the age-old question of ""whodunit"".

1637781,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B00BQXTCVS,Stephanie De Pue,"[4, 6]","Jack Taylor, (2011).  This television series of noir mysteries is set in the current day, in and around Galway on Ireland's rugged western coast.  It features, obviously, Jack Taylor, who has been kicked off the Guarda, Ireland's police force, for booze-related infractions.  He is now working as a ""finder"" (private eye) in Galway City, and, seated, drink in hand, in his favorite bar, he takes on cases the cops won't touch. As based on the  crime fiction of Ken Bruen, this acclaimed Irish series, recommended for mature audiences, stars Iain Glen as Taylor: battered, disheveled, hard-boiled. Set includes three feature-length mysteries on three DVDs: The Guards, The Pikemen, and The Magdalen Martyrs, runs 4  hours, and, thank you Acorn, with all the Irish brogue, has subtitles. (Apparently,  two more of this feature length series that were made will be released shortly.)Taylor is ably played by Iaian Glen, a charismatic Scottish-born actor who plays Sir Richard Carlyle inMasterpiece: Downton Abbey Complete Seasons 1, 2, & 3 DVD Set (Original U.K. Edition), and Mormont inGame of Thrones: The Complete First Season.  He has also played inThe Iron Lady,Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, andHarry Brown.  In THE GUARDS, Anne Henderson hires him  to look for her missing teenage daughter, who she fears was the latest in a series of suspicious local 'suicides', of young girls.  Taylor traces the `suicides' to a sleazy factory, its sleazy manager Ford, and finds illegal sex recordings.  In THE MAGDALEN MARTYRS, Jack is hired by the daughter of a survivor of the infamous Magdalen laundries - a true blight on the nation of Ireland for many years, seeThe Magdalene Sisters, to find the nun the girls called Lucifer who was particularly sadistic.  THE PIKEMEN opens with a scene in which an unknown man is brutally murdered by an unknown assailant, with a weapon that will be unknown to most of us: A steel spearhead with a scythe-like hook on the side, mounted on a shaft.  Some days later we will discover that it is a pike, weapon of choice for earlier Irish revolutionaries known as the pikemen that is now being used by a secret sadistic vigilante group.These fine films are dark of subject matter, and contain violence: true crime noirs.  The scripts are tight and tension-filled; the dialog, spoken in brogue, reflects the storied wit of the Irish, lots of `crac.'  I am not familiar with the underlying Bruen novels, so cannot speak to the episodes' accuracy as adaptations, but at least one other reviewer, I see, is, and speaks highly of them.  The Galway settings look accurate. Although my husband, son of a mother born in Mayo, adjoining county to Galway, and I, who have, separately and together, enjoyed some memorable times in Eyre Square, Galway's most elegant and famous,  were puzzled. The Square's famous statue,  a poet, who looks like a leprechaun in his countrified cap, never once appeared onscreen.  The entertainment is made by a German company; some reviewers believe that some of it is filmed in Germany.  At any rate, the productions are filled with the miserable weather for which Ireland is famous, though there is a sunny day or two.  There's a funny running joke about Taylor's illegally hanging on to his warm Guarda coat, which I'm sure he needs, given the weather.We enjoyed this entertainment in our house.

Jack is hard to like at first, but he turns out to be loyal, persistent, and empathetic as we get to know him.In The Guards, we get to see hot tempered Jack punch a government minister which gets him thrown out of the Garda, the Irish police known as the Guards.  Jack accepts a simple case of looking for a missing teenager.  A young female Guard, Noonan, reluctantly gives Jack some surreptitious help.  The case seems to lead to a serial murderer and maybe an old friend is hiding something.  But then Jack has a ""lost weekend"" due to drinking after a friend is killed in a hit-and-run, so his chance to solve the case seems to disappear.In The Pikemen, Jack agrees to find out if a friend's son committed suicide and he uncovers a vigilante group that then frames him for murder.  Cody, a teenager who begins stalking Jack, may have discovered why the vigilantes might have murdered the friend's son.  But Jack needs both Cody and Officer Noonan to save him from the Pikemen.The Magdalen Martyrs is based partially on the true story of an infamous Irish orphanage whose nuns kept wayward girls in bondage working in a laundry.  Jack is hired by the daughter of one of those girls to find the worst of those nuns, one called ""Lucifer"".  She gives Jack her mother's diary that may reveal a clue to Lucifer's real name.  A drug lord threatens Jack to drop the case and give him the diary.  The young teen son of one of Jack's friends is killed, possibly by a professional hit man.  Who is Lucifer?  Why is the drug lord willing to kill for the diary?  Why did someone hire a hit man to kill a young teenager?  And what does Jack's estranged mother have to do with the case?  This is a very depressing movie and potential viewers should think twice before watching it.Each of the stories is complicated and entertaining, but violent and depressing, especially The Magdalen Martyrs.",4,Rebellious Irish Ex-cop Takes on Vicious Cases,1382659200,"10 25, 2013",2013,2050,"['Galway', 'Ireland', 'alcoholic', 'ex-policeman', 'Jack', 'Taylor', 'make', 'living', 'private', 'detective', 'simple', 'case', 'becomes', 'complicated', 'dangerous', 'vicious', 'Jack', 'hard', 'like', 'first', 'out', 'be', 'loyal', 'persistent', 'empathetic', 'get', 'know', 'Guards', 'get', 'see', 'hot', 'tempered', 'Jack', 'punch', 'government', 'minister', 'thrown', 'Garda', 'Irish', 'police', 'known', 'Guards', 'Jack', 'simple', 'case', 'looking', 'missing', 'teenager', 'young', 'female', 'Guard', 'Noonan', 'reluctantly', 'Jack', 'surreptitious', 'help', 'case', 'lead', 'serial', 'murderer', 'maybe', 'old', 'friend', 'hiding', 'something', 'then', 'Jack', 'lost', 'weekend', 'due', 'drinking', 'friend', 'killed', 'hit-and-run', 'chance', 'solve', 'case', 'disappear.In', 'Pikemen', 'Jack', 'find', 'out', 'friend', 'son', 'committed', 'suicide', 'vigilante', 'group', 'then', 'murder', 'Cody', 'teenager', 'who', 'stalking', 'Jack', 'may', 'have', 'discovered', 'why', 'vigilantes', 'might', 'have', 'murdered', 'friend', 'son', 'Jack', 'Cody', 'Officer', 'Noonan', 'save', 'Pikemen.The', 'Magdalen', 'Martyrs', 'based', 'partially', 'true', 'story', 'infamous', 'Irish', 'orphanage', 'nuns', 'kept', 'wayward', 'girls', 'bondage', 'working', 'laundry', 'Jack', 'hired', 'daughter', 'one', 'girls', 'find', 'worst', 'nuns', 'one', 'called', 'Lucifer', 'Jack', 'mother', 'diary', 'may', 'reveal', 'clue', 'Lucifer', 'real', 'name', 'drug', 'lord', 'Jack', 'drop', 'case', 'give', 'diary', 'young', 'teen', 'son', 'one', 'Jack', 'friends', 'killed', 'possibly', 'professional', 'hit', 'man', 'Who', 'Lucifer', 'Why', 'drug', 'lord', 'willing', 'kill', 'diary', 'Why', 'did', 'someone', 'hire', 'hit', 'man', 'kill', 'young', 'teenager', 'what', 'Jack', 'estranged', 'mother', 'have', 'do', 'case', 'very', 'depressing', 'movie', 'potential', 'viewers', 'should', 'think', 'twice', 'before', 'watching', 'it.Each', 'stories', 'complicated', 'entertaining', 'violent', 'depressing', 'especially', 'Magdalen', 'Martyrs']","JACK TAYLOR, SET 1"

There are only three movies in this set and they progressively worked out the kinks and it became a more solid addition to the noir world. That trend left me with a more positive forecast of the rest of the series than I started with.There's as much drinking in this series as a 70s US TV sitcom. Foul language and blood spirts, too, but not excessove nudity for those who keep track of such things.Cinematography was interesting in that it was mostly urban, you don't see as much of lush, sweeping countryside that is usually in movies related to Ireland. Still a treat. There's a scene in one of the episodes shot under a bridge or something looking out at what would usually be considered the cute village of Galway. It's a short but very spooky, noirish shot that made for a moody scene which is difficult with color instead of black and white. Little things like that perked up the show.One thing that concerned me was that all of the voices seemed a bit muddled. I don't know if that was a technical issue or just the way my ears heard the accents.",4,Shaky start but gets better,1386115200,"12 4, 2013",2013,1158,"['tone', 'characterizations', 'first', 'movie', 'were', 'just', 'off', 'main', 'character', 'seemed', 'too', 'quirky', 'are', 'only', 'three', 'movies', 'set', 'progressively', 'worked', 'out', 'kinks', 'became', 'more', 'solid', 'addition', 'noir', 'world', 'trend', 'left', 'more', 'positive', 'forecast', 'rest', 'series', 'started', 'as', 'much', 'drinking', 'series', '70s', 'US', 'TV', 'sitcom', 'Foul', 'language', 'blood', 'spirts', 'too', 'not', 'excessove', 'nudity', 'who', 'keep', 'track', 'such', 'things.Cinematography', 'was', 'interesting', 'was', 'mostly', 'urban', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'as', 'much', 'lush', 'sweeping', 'countryside', 'usually', 'movies', 'related', 'Ireland', 'Still', 'treat', 'scene', 'one', 'episodes', 'shot', 'bridge', 'something', 'looking', 'out', 'what', 'would', 'usually', 'be', 'considered', 'cute', 'village', 'Galway', 'short', 'very', 'spooky', 'noirish', 'shot', 'made', 'moody', 'scene', 'difficult', 'color', 'instead', 'black', 'white', 'Little', 'things', 'perked', 'up', 'show.One', 'thing', 'concerned', 'was', 'voices', 'seemed', 'bit', 'muddled', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'technical', 'issue', 'just', 'way', 'ears', 'heard', 'accents']","JACK TAYLOR, SET 1"

This is a grim, bleak film noirish show set in Galway, Ireland. So far this show hasn't been broadcast to American audiences (as far as I know, PBS hasn't brought it over yet).The DVD contains three 90 minute episodes. Taylor is an alcoholic former ""Guards"" person who makes a living as a private eye handling strange and unusual cases.The first episode introduces Jack and how he gets involved in the hunt for a serial killer. The pacing for this one was rather tedious and I was ready to write off Jack as a stereotypical ""down on his luck drunk ex-cop who later redeems himself through solving cases nobody else can do."" Thankfully the series picks up steam with the second episode and by the third (involving a sadistic nun), I was fully engaged and interested.The photography in all three is stunning and the viewer gets to see the streets of Galway, post-Celtic Tiger prosperity, which is great, since this is a city I've rarely seen depicted in films or TV.The acting is serviceable though not extraordinary. This is the type of series you'd never seen on American TV - bleak, unrelentingly depressing at times, but also extremely well done, and I look forward to seeing more episodes of the series.",4,"Bleak, Film Noirish Crime Drama Set in Galway - Gets Better with Each Episode!",1384905600,"11 20, 2013",2013,1305,"['fan', 'shows', 'Prime', 'Suspect', 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'series', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'grim', 'bleak', 'film', 'noirish', 'show', 'set', 'Galway', 'Ireland', 'So', 'far', 'show', ""n't"", 'been', 'broadcast', 'American', 'audiences', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'PBS', ""n't"", 'brought', 'yet', '.The', 'DVD', 'three', '90', 'minute', 'episodes', 'Taylor', 'alcoholic', 'former', 'Guards', 'person', 'who', 'living', 'private', 'eye', 'handling', 'strange', 'unusual', 'cases.The', 'first', 'episode', 'introduces', 'Jack', 'how', 'involved', 'hunt', 'serial', 'killer', 'pacing', 'one', 'was', 'rather', 'tedious', 'was', 'ready', 'write', 'off', 'Jack', 'stereotypical', 'down', 'luck', 'drunk', 'ex-cop', 'who', 'later', 'solving', 'cases', 'nobody', 'else', 'can', 'do', 'Thankfully', 'series', 'up', 'steam', 'second', 'episode', 'third', 'involving', 'sadistic', 'nun', 'was', 'fully', 'engaged', 'interested.The', 'photography', 'three', 'stunning', 'viewer', 'see', 'streets', 'Galway', 'post-Celtic', 'Tiger', 'prosperity', 'great', 'city', ""'ve"", 'rarely', 'seen', 'depicted', 'films', 'TV.The', 'acting', 'serviceable', 'not', 'extraordinary', 'type', 'series', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'American', 'TV', 'bleak', 'unrelentingly', 'depressing', 'times', 'also', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'more', 'episodes', 'series']","JACK TAYLOR, SET 1"
