1104121,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B000VTHYAE,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[1, 2]","This series of 10 episodes ran on HBO a couple of years ago. It was supposed to continue but never did. After viewing this first and only season, I can understand why. The series began with great promise but ultimately petered out. It lacked characters compelling enough to want to follow and plot lines strong enough to sustain more episodes.I guess it will ultimately be remembered most for the very gratuitous sex which occasionally borders on the pornographic. One of the achievements of the series is to portray how sex can be used to cover up problems or compensate for them -- but how its absence too can be so terribly destructive to a relationship. Ultimately, I got tired of the sex. Characters were forever throwing off some or all of their clothes to indulge in briefing panting, grunting bouts like animals coupling in the woods. It got to be unsavory and ultimately boring.The series circles around three couples and their therapist played by Jane Alexander, who with her husband and former lover forms a fourth menage. I was struck by how useless she was as a therapist. For her banal observations I certainly would not shell out $110 an hour.Couple one, Dave and Katie, live a middleclass life with two kids in the suburbs and seem happy -- except that they haven't made love in a year. Dave prefers quiet masturbation. It's not clear why. Is there a reason, other than the fact that the scriptwriters decided it should be so?Couple two, Carolyn and Pallack (not sure of the spelling) are rich and successful and self-absorbed. She wants a baby but can't get pregnant. Couple three are Jamie and Hugo, 20-somethings about to get married. They split up when Hugo can't verbally commit to remain faithful for the rest of his life. Jamie falls straight into bed with Nick.None of these people was tremendously compelling or interesting. None of them seem to have much of an intellectual life. They don't appear to read or listen to music or attend the theater. It's all work and screwing.The series sells the view that being and staying married is tremendously difficult. Is it so difficult? Many of us manage just fine.The real problem with this series, as compared to other HBO offerings that I have so admired such as ""The Sopranos"" and ""The Wire"" is that those dramas were packed full of memorable characters bursting with life, while the characters in ""Tell Me You Love Me"" seem to be sleepwalking through life.",2,Starts interestingly but runs out of steam,1242086400,"05 12, 2009",2009,2429,"['series', '10', 'episodes', 'ran', 'HBO', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'supposed', 'continue', 'never', 'did', 'viewing', 'first', 'only', 'season', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'series', 'began', 'great', 'promise', 'ultimately', 'petered', 'out', 'lacked', 'characters', 'compelling', 'enough', 'want', 'follow', 'plot', 'lines', 'strong', 'enough', 'sustain', 'more', 'episodes.I', 'guess', 'will', 'ultimately', 'be', 'remembered', 'most', 'very', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'occasionally', 'borders', 'pornographic', 'One', 'achievements', 'series', 'portray', 'how', 'sex', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'cover', 'up', 'problems', 'compensate', 'how', 'absence', 'too', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'terribly', 'destructive', 'relationship', 'Ultimately', 'got', 'tired', 'sex', 'Characters', 'were', 'forever', 'throwing', 'off', 'clothes', 'indulge', 'briefing', 'panting', 'grunting', 'bouts', 'animals', 'coupling', 'woods', 'got', 'be', 'unsavory', 'ultimately', 'boring.The', 'series', 'circles', 'three', 'couples', 'therapist', 'played', 'Jane', 'Alexander', 'who', 'husband', 'former', 'lover', 'fourth', 'menage', 'was', 'struck', 'how', 'useless', 'was', 'therapist', 'banal', 'observations', 'certainly', 'would', 'not', 'shell', 'out', '110', 'hour.Couple', 'one', 'Dave', 'Katie', 'live', 'middleclass', 'life', 'two', 'kids', 'suburbs', 'seem', 'happy', 'have', ""n't"", 'made', 'love', 'year', 'Dave', 'prefers', 'quiet', 'masturbation', 'not', 'clear', 'why', 'there', 'reason', 'other', 'fact', 'scriptwriters', 'decided', 'should', 'be', 'so', 'Couple', 'two', 'Carolyn', 'Pallack', 'not', 'sure', 'spelling', 'are', 'rich', 'successful', 'self-absorbed', 'baby', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'pregnant', 'Couple', 'three', 'are', 'Jamie', 'Hugo', '20-somethings', 'get', 'married', 'split', 'up', 'when', 'Hugo', 'ca', ""n't"", 'verbally', 'commit', 'remain', 'faithful', 'rest', 'life', 'Jamie', 'straight', 'bed', 'Nick.None', 'people', 'was', 'tremendously', 'compelling', 'interesting', 'None', 'seem', 'have', 'much', 'intellectual', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'appear', 'read', 'listen', 'music', 'attend', 'theater', 'work', 'screwing.The', 'series', 'view', 'being', 'staying', 'married', 'tremendously', 'difficult', 'so', 'difficult', 'Many', 'manage', 'just', 'fine.The', 'real', 'problem', 'series', 'compared', 'other', 'HBO', 'offerings', 'have', 'so', 'admired', 'such', 'Sopranos', 'Wire', 'dramas', 'were', 'packed', 'full', 'memorable', 'characters', 'bursting', 'life', 'characters', 'Tell', 'Me', 'Love', 'seem', 'be', 'sleepwalking', 'life']",Tell Me You Love Me: Season 1
1104122,A172FVEA83DHOP,B000VTHYAE,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","It is said that the suggestion of violence can be more powerful than the image of violence. The same can be said for sex. The director's habit of exploring the fine details of an actor's anatomy generally establishes nothing about the characters or the relationship between the characters, with a couple of important exceptions. Once it's established that the characters are having sex, there's no need to observe the mechanics, especially when it comes at the expense of observing the impact of the act. I found myself fast-forwarding through the sex scenes, because in general they were long, tedious, artless and irrelevant. It's rather like spending two minutes watching a scene of someone silently eating a plate of spaghetti, with closeups on their fork, plate and mouth. The point of it is what exactly? That said, the performances in this show are phenomenal. The pain and dysfunction on display is raw and honest, but nevertheless it is deeply affecting to watch the characters in the show struggle against their own imperfections for the sake of their spouse. I winced, laughed and pondered as I saw many a moment from my own marriage portrayed in each episode.

On your typical TV show when a couple is about to make love or have sex, the camera usually pans to the close up of the couple's faces as they writhe and moan with pleasure. Leaving it up to the viewer to fill in the blanks. On Tell Me You Love me the camera pans back so you can see the couple in all their nude glory, breasts, penis, testicles, every nook and cranny. It made (at least for me) viewing the show far more realistic. The story line is well written, Emmy good in my opinion, and well acted.

1104132,A16VH7SPVPVJKV,B000VTHYAE,Harvey M. Canter,"[31, 34]","(NOTE: SOME SPOILERS BELOW--TREAD LIGHTLY!)I have to admit that, as a clinician myself, I'll watch most anything that has a mental health angle in it. Typically, they never get the therapy (or the therapist) done right, at least for more than a fleeting moment. This show is no exception. The premise is interesting: several couples is a mid-size metropolis are seeing the same shrink, and we see them both during therapy and in their 'real' lives. The shrink, too, has her own life outside the office, and we (the audience) are a busy fly on many walls as we follow them all around each episode. We hear the outlines of their problems in therapy, and we go deeper when we are with them outside, comparing the two evolving versions & seeing where the truth comes up a little short, and where they are copping out. In one sense, we are used to this device as it was used religiously (and very effectively) in the Sopranos. So we see a bit of the sociopathy of everyday life, to coin a phrase; or, maybe just an honest look at the flaws of human characters.You can see where this mid-western novella is going to go--it's a small town and their paths are going to cross, eventually, and realize they are all therapy sibs. But, we only got a hint of that by the end of season one. Too bad--I thought there were going to be some pyrotechnics when all those fuses started to catch.....but....oh well! I guess the producers were pretty confident about getting a second go round.Along the way, we flies are witness to the most raw, naturalistic sex scenes that I have ever seen on TV/cable. That is not to say it is sexy stuff--it is pretty unpolished & non-stylized. You see all the anatomy, somewhat obliquely and in natural low light conditions, but nothing is left to the imagination. The only thing I was wondering was, are those prosthetic phalli or the real thing? And the sex scenes tend to drag on, and there is no pretense here to make the trysts hot, sexy, kinky--they are just pretty run of the mill, daily grind kind of stuff. Some highlights you ask? Well, we get to see the husband in the sexless marriage treat himself to some solo satisfaction--and boy was I sorry I watched that scene! And, for the geriatric set--there is included a pretty raw scene with Jane Alexander and her husband getting it on in a recliner. There was one reviewer who said how great she looked in this scene--well, I would say that with her clothes on she is indeed a classy, elegant grand dame. But, nude and vigorously humping? Please, this was not sexy and not entertaining. Good commercial for Viagara, but that is about it. In fact, whenever there is a sex scene one feels as if it is very private and this is the time to go fix a sandwich or shut off the sprinklers, rather than do so at the commercial. It is a rather interesting artistic achievement, to say the least.Here is the BIG problem with this show, as I see it: none of the characters are likeable. None. Not one. Their stories are somewhat interesting, but you cannot develop a liking for any of the people. Most of them are professional class, and they are all whiners, wimps, phonies, narcissists, sex-addicts, or anhedonic icebergs. Or some combination of the above. They are SO bland and/or neurotic that you don't want to spend an hour a week with them, not a one of them. Oh, and don't you be looking for any persons of color in this show--unless you count different hair colors as evidence of diversity. It's all Oscar Meyer on Wonder Bread with mayo on a paper plate. A plain, white paper plate.... There is no diversity among the characters, between the character, or within the characters. Imagine 'All in the Family' and every character is an insipid, vacuous version of Archie Bunker. Guys like us we had it made....Even in the Sopranos, you could develop a liking for those greedy psychopathic killers and their various sycophantic partners--THAT was part of the incredible achievement of that show. To make you forget that these Jersey guys with the SUVs who are wolfing down franks at a bbq are stone-cold killers, and they are just regular folks with mortgages, PTA meetings, mid-life crises, etc. And--you identify just a little with the lure of the larceny and of getting away with it....But here? You wouldn't want to share a cup of joe with any of these people. This to me is the main crisis, as a viewer.Another main weakness, ironically, is the whole therapy device. I thought Jane Alexander was earnest in the anchoring central role as the therapist, but she was stuck with some of the lamest therapist dialogue yet concocted for a TV show. And, we are dropping in at the moment when her big book is being released, so we are led to believe she is really some kind of expert, but I found her verbal interventions wordy, trite, unrealistic, patronizing, and untherapeutic. But, she was earnest and sincere, for what that is worth: the cases move along more or less disastrously for each of the couples. Nice work! This tendency to romantic decline includes Jane's own marriage, imperiled by the mid-season revelation of a past affair, which threatens to resume when her ex-lover just happens to turn up in this ever-shrinking cesspool of a town.So, while I stuck it out for the entire season, I was ready to bail about a third of the way through, but my gal and I were committed to seeing it through. Probably the most interesting aspect was that the producers attached about 5-6 minutes onto the end of each episode that featured real life couples who were watching and commenting on the show's progress and how it sort-of mirrored their own struggles. Now, these people WERE very likeable and interesting, more so than the actual cast. That was another problem with the show, as far as I was concerned. And, similarly, the show did spark good discussions between my partner and I. So, in the end, it was a case of life imitating life that was imitating art that bore no resemblance at all to life, at least any life you would want to be living.Well, I guess maybe see it for yourself and decide, but if you are not into it by the 3rd show, it ain't getting any better!",3,Tell Me That You Loathe Me,1222041600,"09 22, 2008",2008,6145,"['NOTE', 'SOME', 'SPOILERS', 'BELOW',

Straight people in real life are not much more boring than gay people are, but in most movies and on TV they are so shallow, dull and predictable that watching them do anything - especially have sex - is a big yawn. I found myself wishing for more of the therapy sessions with Jane Alexander, just because she is such a delight. This is not the worst thing I have ever seen, but it is hard to get through if you are gay. It was for me, anyway.",2,Why is straight sex so boring?,1311033600,"07 19, 2011",2011,534,"['series', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'least', 'one', 'lead', 'couples', 'had', 'been', 'gay', 'Straight', 'people', 'real', 'life', 'are', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'boring', 'gay', 'people', 'are', 'most', 'movies', 'TV', 'are', 'so', 'shallow', 'dull', 'predictable', 'watching', 'do', 'anything', 'especially', 'have', 'sex', 'big', 'yawn', 'found', 'wishing', 'more', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'Jane', 'Alexander', 'just', 'such', 'delight', 'not', 'worst', 'thing', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'hard', 'get', 'are', 'gay', 'was', 'anyway']",Tell Me You Love Me: Season 1
1104134,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B000VTHYAE,Kevin Killian,"[45, 54]","Much hyped and sensitively written HBO series analyzing the marital and other problems of three couples, plus their therapist's own back story in what most people would consider late, late middle age.  You'll be surprised to see the vigor with which Jane Alexander puts into her fervent love scenes with David Selby (yes, from DARK SHADOWS).  Alexander has never struck me as being much of a softcore type, but here she looks great and she puts everything she has into it, a risky move for the former head of the NEA which might get her into trouble with her former constituency, but I think the risky work she does here gives her more credibility, and flows neatly into the scenes she has with her clients.  In a way it will remind you of Lorraine Bracco treating Tony in THE SOPRANOS and cynical minds will assume that TELL ME YOU LOVE ME is like Dr. Melfi on ecstasy, but give the show a chance, it definitely has its own rhythm, and you won't pick up on it right away if you're used to the rough and tumble rapidfire cutting of most US made hourlongs.Here the pace is positively molasses, Ingmar Bergman style, long, long scenes of domestic life interspersed with some pretty amazing bedroom scenes (what they call ""random play"" on Facebook).  You won't believe you're watching this on TV.  But it's all mixed in with hours and hours of nothing at all, in which it's up to the actors to convince us that there are real people behind those insertions and releases.  Some of the actors are better than others, though none is really horrible.  At first I wondered, how did they talk these actors into having such realistic sex scenes?  Did they recruit them from porn movies?  But I recognized some of them from other legitimate work and I guess the answer is, they went for the gusto of it.  Dave and Katie are pushing forty, they've stopped making love and just live for their children and homelife, always repaving the patio et cetera.  Their little girl has started having her period even though she's ten.  Ally Walker plays Katie, the dissatisfied wife who wonders where all the romance went in her marriage, while Sherry Stringfield from ER plays Rita, her no nonsense pal.  La Stringfield still acts as though she were the undisputed star of the show (in fact of the entire entertainment world), but she is pared back to the point where you can actually believe it.  Tim DeKay is the husband who prefers to bring himself off under the covers rather than face another go round with his wife.  It's bleak and miserable.Adam Scott and Sonya Walger play a somewhat younger couple, Pawlik and Carolyn.  They make love by the clock so that Carolyn can fulfill her dream of getting pregnant.  But petulant Pawlik doesn't like being made to perform at gunpoint, so he starts balking and expressing his deep dislike of his wife.  She's quite a piece of work and the script does little to soften her up.  More power to the actress who plays her because this is a tough part to play.Finally there is Jaime, a young sous chef at a trendy restaurant, torn between two good looking guys, incapable of being faithful to either.  It was really this girl who plays her whom I thought initially wasn't as much an actress as an inflatable doll with a helium voice.  Poor Jaime can't keep her clothes on for twenty minutes at a time.  One of the boys in her life is played by former LOST star Ian Somerhalder, the other by some other dude.  One is called Nick, the other Hugo.  I can't remember now who is who, but stand back folks because, as it turns out, Michelle Borth as Jaime is the one who really wins your heart by the end of the season's run.  I began to see why she was the way she was, and credit Miss Borth for a sensitive unfolding of real depth.The show is slow, no doubt about it, and goes to some painful places.  Will the unabashed focus on sexuality make it an audience winner?  Hard to say, but it was well worth trying out!  Give it a chance, you might learn something!

It's the story of three couples (actually two couples and one extra whiny Hipster twit) who go and see Jane Alexander's relationship therapist.One couple is decidely Yuppiesh -- they live in a swank architecturally daring house that looks like it cost millions and Sonya Walger's lawyer wife is extra manipulative to her effeminate, dead boring husband, played vapidly by Adam Scott (and his floppy hair).The second is a skinny grasping young saute chef played by Michelle Borth and is probably THE most annoying character. She's in a twist because her fiance admitted he didn't see himself being faithful to her for all eternity when they tie the knot. She retaliates by dumping him, humping a couple of different guys (including 'Lost's' Ian Somerhandler) and then going to Jane Alexander's therapist who promptly detects that the gal has never been faithful to any of her lovers.Personally, I didn't give two figs for the Yuppie couple or the Hipster and her problems. The meatiest plot and characters were reserved for Tim DeKay and Ally Walker as the Old Married Fuds, David and Katie. They're both excellent parents, devoted to their kids, furiously busy homemakers (there's a lot of renovating) ... and they're terrible lovers, sensually completely lost to each other and 'in a lot of pain' as Alexander's therapist aptly puts it. This couple seemed the most believable probably because they're the most flawed. Walker's Katie has a big problem. She's can't bring herself to masturbate and she's terrified her husband knows. Seeing as how self-gratification is the first stop on the orgasm bus, Katie's in trouble. In the finale ep, when David and Katie find each other again sexually there's a lot of good acting and it's appropriately steamy.

Powsky ""hello""","[3, 10]","Maybe I should stop borrowing relationship shows from the local library.What About Brian - The Complete Seriestaxed my fragile patience to the breaking point. This thing destroys it. Even though there's some fairly hot and explicit sex in the thing (it is HBO after all), the sex only serves to distract from the crappy self-involved nature of the main characters. It reminds me a lot of9 songs - Unrated Full Uncut Versionwhere the explicit (and real) sex gives way to a tedious little couple who hate each other.However, 9 Songs had one very clear advantage over this show. 9 Songs was over after an hour and a half. This show just goes on and on. Every couple is selfish. Every couple is in therapy. The sexless couple is sad. The wanna have a baby couple is on the brink of breaking up. The young engaged couple is whiny. The girl in that couple has a Meadow Soprano whine that makes one realize why she never became as major a character on that show as she could have been (although that episode where she badgers Finn into proposing should have told us that already).Do you like sitting around with your boring married couples as their relationships fall apart? Then this is the show for you. Well after you watch a fun married couple have a horrible evening inWHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? 11X14 B&W; PHOTO. Otherwise, steer clear.

1104149,ANOBZWKE25SBY,B000VTHYAE,Tracy Vest,"[15, 18]","Earlier this year, HBO offered yet another ground breaking series - this one revolving around marital strife and therapy. Opting for realism, the stories are interspersed with intensive therapy sessions, some of the most realistic and explicit intimate scenes ever presented on television, and the daily routine of couples in three stages of relationships (four if you count therapist May played by Jane Alexander and her husband of 43 years, played by David Selby).David and Katie (Tim DeKay and Ally Walker from ""Profiler"") have been married 12 years and have grown so far apart that they are not longer intimate. Katie wants therapy to repair their distance while David just wants to skate by and pretend everything is okay. Palek and Carolyn (Adam Scott and Sonya Walger) are yuppies who have everything they could ever want except for a baby (though Palek wonders if he even wants that). Jamie and Hugo (Michelle Borth and Luke Ferrell Kirby) are an engaged couple who break up early on due to Jamie's trust issues with Hugo's fidelity. But soon another man enters her life (Ian Somerhalder, the brother from ""Lost"" who loved his sister a little too much), forcing Jamie to face the truth about her own past.Extras include reactions to story lines by real life couples (which really don't add much), as well as behind the scenes and the usual making of shorts. It's a heavy series and oftentimes depressing; there is nothing light to the storylines, in fact viewers will wonder if any therapist can save some of these crumbling relationships.",4,HBO's latest ground breaker,1196035200,"11 26, 2007",2007,1547,"['Earlier', 'year', 'HBO', 'offered', 'yet', 'ground', 'breaking', 'series', 'one', 'revolving', 'marital', 'strife', 'therapy', 'Opting', 'realism', 'stories', 'are', 'interspersed', 'intensive', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'most', 'realistic', 'explicit', 'intimate', 'scenes', 'ever', 'presented', 'television', 'daily', 'routine', 'couples', 'three', 'stages', 'relationships', 'four', 'count', 'therapist', 'May', 'played', 'Jane', 'Alexander', 'husband', '43', 'years', 'played', 'David', 'Selby', '.David', 'Katie', 'Tim', 'DeKay', 'Ally', 'Walker', 'Profiler', 'have', 'been', 'married', '12', 'years', 'have', 'grown', 'so', 'far', 'apart', 'are', 'not', 'longer', 'intimate', 'Katie', 'therapy', 'repair', 'distance', 'David', 'just', 'skate', 'pretend', 'everything', 'okay', 'Palek', 'Carolyn', 'Adam', 'Scott', 'Sonya', 'Walger', 'are', 'yuppies', 'who', 'have', 'everything', 'could', 'ever', 'want', 'baby', 'Palek', 'wonders', 'even', 'Jamie', 'Hugo', 'Michelle', 'Borth', 'Luke', 'Ferrell', 'Kirby', 'are', 'engaged', 'couple', 'who', 'break', 'up', 'early', 'due', 'Jamie', 'trust', 'issues', 'Hugo', 'fidelity', 'soon', 'man', 'life', 'Ian', 'Somerhalder', 'brother', 'Lost', 'who', 'loved', 'sister', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'forcing', 'Jamie', 'face', 'truth', 'own', 'past.Extras', 'include', 'reactions', 'story', 'lines', 'real', 'life', 'couples', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'as', 'well', 'scenes', 'usual', 'making', 'shorts', 'heavy', 'series', 'depressing', 'nothing', 'light', 'storylines', 'fact', 'viewers', 'will', 'wonder', 'therapist', 'can', 'save', 'crumbling', 'relationships']",Tell Me You Love Me: Season 1
