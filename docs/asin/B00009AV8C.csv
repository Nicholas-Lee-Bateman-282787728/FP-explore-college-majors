753402,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B00009AV8C,Artist & Author,"[1, 1]","Probably the single most important reason that a drama fails is because the actors are unable to adequately express the appropriate emotions.  Therefore, it is truly a delight to find a movie with such fitting and intensely expressed emotions.  Maybe I should add that I watch as many as thirty to thirty-five movies a week when I am working on my book at my cottage, and it is extremely rare for me to find a movie where I have to put everything aside to watch a movie.  The feeling in Tully is so intense that I was transfixed, almost hypnotized, by what was happening on screen.The film had not gone very far when I told my wife that Tully, Sr. was the most believable farmer I'd ever seen on screen.  I know that he acted with the Actor's Theater of Louisville, KY for fifteen years, but I still think he must have spent quite a bit of time farming for real!  I grew up in the hog capital of the world in Illinois, surrounded by relatives and friends who were farmers, and he would have blended in with any group of old farmers discussing their crops and 'the old days.'  His emotions in the scene where he finds out the truth about his long-gone wife is so real one has to wonder if it didn't really happen to him!  For that scene alone it is worth watching the movie.Of course, the movie is about the younger Tully.  The expressed relationship between him and his father, his brother, and Ella is also extremely believable.  All these younger generation actors are also extremely gifted in expressing the appropriate emotions at the proper times.  Indeed, this whole movie should be seen by aspiring actors to observe outstanding expressions of emotions.If there is anything I would consider negative about the movie, one would be that I didn't find Tully's 'arms-length' sexual affair with the town slut to add anything to the story.  A second one would be when Tully began to realize the truth and Ella went to him to offer him a sympathetic and understanding ear, instead of having a serious talk they end up with their clothes off in the back of his car.  It would have been more appropriate for Ella to let Tully know she was interested in him sexually, but that then was not the appropriate time.  Also, there is a modest amount of coarse language that wasn't really necessary.  These are minor drawbacks, however, in an otherwise outstanding movie.To conclude, it you are interested in fast-paced action films, pass this one by.  But, it you can appreciate the slower life of the Midwest farming country, this is a realistic portrayal of that life.  No matter how idyllic such a life looks from the outside, this movie shows that life's twists and turns affect farmers just as much as anyone else.  And, it does it with such an accurate depiction of the emotions involved that you'll probably wish you could be there to offer your advice and support.",5,Life's Twists and Turns Affects Farmers as Much as Anyone Else,1208131200,"04 14, 2008",2008,2863,"['Probably', 'single', 'most', 'important', 'reason', 'drama', 'actors', 'are', 'unable', 'adequately', 'express', 'appropriate', 'emotions', 'Therefore', 'truly', 'delight', 'find', 'movie', 'such', 'fitting', 'intensely', 'expressed', 'emotions', 'Maybe', 'should', 'add', 'watch', 'as', 'many', 'thirty', 'thirty-five', 'movies', 'week', 'when', 'am', 'working', 'book', 'cottage', 'extremely', 'rare', 'find', 'movie', 'where', 'have', 'put', 'everything', 'aside', 'watch', 'movie', 'feeling', 'Tully', 'so', 'intense', 'was', 'transfixed', 'almost', 'hypnotized', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'screen.The', 'film', 'had', 'not', 'gone', 'very', 'far', 'when', 'told', 'wife', 'Tully', 'Sr.', 'was', 'most', 'believable', 'farmer', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', 'screen', 'know', 'acted', 'Actor', 'Theater', 'Louisville', 'KY', 'fifteen', 'years', 'still', 'think', 'must', 'have', 'spent', 'quite', 'bit', 'time', 'farming', 'real', 'grew', 'up', 'hog', 'capital', 'world', 'Illinois', 'surrounded', 'relatives', 'friends', 'who', 'were', 'farmers', 'would', 'have', 'blended', 'group', 'old', 'farmers', 'discussing', 'crops', 'old', 'days', 'emotions', 'scene', 'where', 'out', 'truth', 'long-gone', 'wife', 'so', 'real', 'one', 'wonder', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'happen', 'scene', 'alone', 'worth', 'watching', 'movie.Of', 'course', 'movie', 'younger', 'Tully', 'expressed', 'relationship', 'father', 'brother', 'Ella', 'also', 'extremely', 'believable', 'younger', 'generation', 'actors', 'are', 'also', 'extremely', 'gifted', 'expressing', 'appropriate', 'emotions', 'proper', 'times', 'Indeed', 'whole', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'aspiring', 'actors', 'observe', 'outstanding', 'expressions', 'emotions.If', 'anything', 'would', 'consider', 'negative', 'movie', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'Tully', ""'arms-length"", 'sexual', 'affair', 'town', 'slut', 'add', 'anything', 'story', 'second', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'when', 'Tully', 'began', 'realize', 'truth', 'Ella', 'went', 'offer', 'sympathetic', 'understanding', 'ear', 'instead', 'having', 'serious', 'talk', 'end', 'up', 'clothes', 'back', 'car', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'appropriate', 'Ella', 'let', 'Tully', 'know', 'was', 'interested', 'sexually', 'then', 'was', 'not', 'appropriate', 'time', 'Also', 'modest', 'amount', 'coarse', 'language', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'necessary', 'are', 'minor', 'drawbacks', 'however', 'otherwise', 'outstanding', 'movie.To', 'conclude', 'are', 'interested', 'fast-paced', 'action', 'films', 'pass', 'one', 'can', 'appreciate', 'slower', 'life', 'Midwest', 'farming', 'country', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'life', 'matter', 'how', 'idyllic', 'life', 'outside', 'movie', 'life', 'twists', 'turns', 'affect', 'farmers', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'anyone', 'else', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'emotions', 'involved', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'wish', 'could', 'be', 'there', 'offer', 'advice', 'support']",Tully

While Tully is an outgoing, sometimes overbearing, ladies' man, Earl is introverted, shy and often the object of his brother's teasing. When their Father receives a foreclosure notice from a collection agency over money that he didn't know that he owed, a series of events are set into motion that change the relationship between Father and sons and bring the family's past into the forefront of their present lives. The tension created by old secrets and new problems causes Tully to abandon his womanizing ways and puerile demeanor and seek the friendship of Ella (Julianne Nicholson), a young woman who is a good friend of Earl's. Ella's friends fear for her feelings when she becomes friendly with Tully, and Tully himself tries to drive Ella away when he realizes that he has strong feelings for her at the same time he must deal with family crises. But Ella and Tully fall in love in spite of these things and cope together when an unexpected tragedy brings an end to the family's crisis.&quot;Tully&quot;'s quiet tone and measured pace beautifully reflect the midwestern landscape which is not only the setting for this film, but often seems to be a character in it as well. It would be accurate to say that the pace of this film is slow. But its leisurely pace is deliberately and meticulously crafted, and it never drags or bores. The family crises in &quot;Tully&quot; could easily be construed as the stuff of melodramas, but there isn't a bit of melodrama in this film. The characters seem so real that you might think to reach out and touch them, and they cope with revelations that strike at the heart of their self-images the way that level-headed people do: Mostly privately, quietly and effectively. I cannot praise director Hilary Birmingham, cinematographer John Foster, and the principal actors enough for being able to sustain &quot;Tully&quot;'s even, quiet lyricism throughout the film. Impeccable pacing, exquisite cinematography, an excellent script, and great understated performances, so rarely seen together, combine to make &quot;Tully&quot; a true gem of a film. I expected this to be a decent midwestern drama, which inspires limited enthusiasm. But it turned out to be one of the best films of 2002. (It was actually made in 2000.) &quot;Tully&quot; isn't a movie for those who like their films frenetically-paced, but it is a beautiful film with astonishingly good and touchingly subdued performances. I look forward to future projects from director Hilary Birmingham and this excellent cast.Note: On the VHS version of this film, there is a short film entitled &quot;The Third Date&quot; that precedes the main feature.

The James Dean part goes to Anson Mount who plays the title character Tully Coates Jr. (maybe, I suppose the title could refer to Tully Coates, Sr.).  The two title characters operate a Nebraska farm with the help of younger brother Earl (Glenn Fitzgerald).  The Abra role goes to Julianne Nicholson who plays Ella Smalley, a veterinary student home for the summer.The harsher Cain and Abel elements are somewhat filed down as Ella starts out as Earl's best friend; he is sincerely protective as she and Tully Jr. tentatively produce romantic sparks.  There is only mild tension between the three men during the story.""Tully"" at its most basic is a coming-of-age story for Mount's character and probably my favorite on-screen romance.  Best scene for us film language nuts is when Ella discovers some dirt on her face after getting into Tully's car and discretely wipes it off; nonverbally telling us more than could have been communicated in several pages of dialogue.Tully Sr.'s financial problems provide the main side story, which meanders around, occasionally touching the main story, until both storylines intersect at the end.  Unlike a lot of parallel storylines, these two have a nice unity, as the tentative progress of the romance is a nice match for the elliptical way in which the side story is slowly revealed.Tully Jr. is the local rou&eacute;, hard for girls to resist and not inclined to resist the opportunities that come his way.  And apparently until this summer Ella has merely been bemused by her friend's brother, even asking him early in the film: ""What's it like to drive women crazy?"" But then director Hilary Birmingham begins to subtly show Ella picking up on a deeper side of Tully at the same time that he is discovering a vague dissatisfaction with his shallow conquests.The supporting performances are excellent and nicely complement the three main roles.Then again, what do I know?

753416,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B00009AV8C,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[39, 42]","Based on my memory of reviews when this film was first released, I expected a kind of comedy-drama-romance, which it is not. It can best be described as a family melodrama, set on a small farm in Nebraska (actually shot in the rural community of Ft. Calhoun, near Omaha). The elements are somewhat familiar: an older man raising two sons, of somewhat different temperaments, all haunted by the memory of a mother who had aspirations beyond the narrow confines of the farm (she names a horse Jackie, after Jackie Kennedy, because she ""liked famous people""). During a summer, as the boys have grown into young men, the truth of their mother's past begins to make itself known, and all are deeply affected.The story has a leisurely pace as it unfolds, and for a time it seems to be about the growing attraction between womanizer Tully and Ella, a college-educated friend of his younger brother. But this becomes a thread in the larger story of a family's secrets and loyalties surfacing after years of silence and half-truths. For its length, it's a small film, and its strength is not in big effects, sex and nudity, or heavy plotting. Instead there are well-acted scenes between people in muted conflict who struggle with emotions and the difficulty of trusting others with the truth about themselves. This will not be everyone's idea of entertainment, but as indie movies go, I found that it rewarded my patience.The cinematography captures the deep greens of mid-summer, and scenes are often shot in early morning or late afternoon, so the golden, glancing sunlight lights characters with a rich glow and casts cool shadows. Night scenes are played against a textured fabric of insect sounds. Always the camera captures the isolation and solitude of country living.Perhaps the only real ring of inaccuracy in the film is the fact that so little of the dawn-to-dusk work of actual farming is reflected in the lives of the characters. These boys have an awful lot of time on their hands; the farm seems to take care of itself. The film is based on a story by writer Tom McNeal, whose novel ""Goodnight, Nebraska"" has similar characters (a young couple), a rural small town setting, and touches on similar themes. For fans of the film, I recommend McNeal's book.",4,Two brothers and the summer a hidden past is revealed,1058313600,"07 16, 2003",2003,2259,"['Based', 'memory', 'reviews', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'expected', 'kind', 'comedy-drama-romance', 'not', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'family', 'melodrama', 'set', 'small', 'farm', 'Nebraska', 'actually', 'shot', 'rural', 'community', 'Ft.', 'Calhoun', 'Omaha', 'elements', 'are', 'somewhat', 'familiar', 'older', 'man', 'raising', 'two', 'sons', 'somewhat', 'different', 'temperaments', 'haunted', 'memory', 'mother', 'who', 'had', 'aspirations', 'narrow', 'confines', 'farm', 'horse', 'Jackie', 'Jackie', 'Kennedy', 'liked', 'famous', 'people', 'summer', 'boys', 'have', 'grown', 'young', 'men', 'truth', 'mother', 'past', 'make', 'known', 'are', 'deeply', 'affected.The', 'story', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'time', 'be', 'growing', 'attraction', 'womanizer', 'Tully', 'Ella', 'college-educated', 'friend', 'younger', 'brother', 'thread', 'larger', 'story', 'family', 'secrets', 'loyalties', 'surfacing', 'years', 'silence', 'half-truths', 'length', 'small', 'film', 'strength', 'not', 'big', 'effects', 'sex', 'nudity', 'heavy', 'plotting', 'Instead', 'are', 'well-acted', 'scenes', 'people', 'muted', 'conflict', 'who', 'struggle', 'emotions', 'difficulty', 'trusting', 'others', 'truth', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'idea', 'entertainment', 'indie', 'movies', 'go', 'found', 'rewarded', 'patience.The', 'cinematography', 'deep', 'greens', 'mid-summer', 'scenes', 'are', 'often', 'shot', 'early', 'morning', 'late', 'afternoon', 'golden', 'glancing', 'sunlight', 'lights', 'characters', 'rich', 'glow', 'casts', 'cool', 'shadows', 'Night', 'scenes', 'are', 'played', 'textured', 'fabric', 'insect', 'sounds', 'camera', 'isolation', 'solitude', 'country', 'only', 'real', 'ring', 'inaccuracy', 'film', 'fact', 'so', 'little', 'dawn-to-dusk', 'work', 'actual', 'farming', 'reflected', 'lives', 'characters', 'boys', 'have', 'awful', 'lot', 'time', 'hands', 'farm', 'take', 'care', 'film', 'based', 'story', 'writer', 'Tom', 'McNeal', 'novel', 'Goodnight', 'Nebraska', 'similar', 'characters', 'young', 'couple', 'rural', 'small', 'town', 'setting', 'touches', 'similar', 'themes', 'fans', 'film', 'recommend', 'McNeal', 'book']",Tully

Oldest son Tully (Anson Mount) is a bit of a lothario and is currently involved with an older woman who strips for a living (she calls it ""burlesque dancing"").  His younger brother, Earl (Glenn Fitzgerald), is a bit more naive and impressionable.  Their father, Tully Sr. (Bob Burrus), is an emotionally repressed man who was tasked with raising his two young sons following the death of his wife in a car accident.  When their father receives notice that a lien has been placed against their farm, their world begins to unravel and long suppressed family secrets come forth.""Tully"" is the kind of small indie gem that makes the genre so worthwhile.  I was expecting a likeable film, but I was surprised by the emotional wallop it packs. Despite its small scale, the film tells a story that's universal, focusing on how the lack of communication between family members can be so devastating.  Although the main plotline could take place anywhere, setting it on a Midwest farm greatly strengthens the emotional impact of the story by grounding the story and preventing it from spinning into melodrama.  Based on a short story by Tom McNeal, ""Tully"" is a film that takes its time, and some viewers may be bored by the molasses-paced plotline.  However, patient viewers will be greatly rewarded.  Indeed, the small details help make ""Tully"" such a pleasure, such as the flirtatious relationship between Tully Sr. and the grocery clerk.  Every scene rings true, even when the storyline starts to become a bit too much.To date, director Hilary Birmingham has not made another film, which is a real loss, as she is in full command of this story and her actors.  The film was nominated for Best Feature at the Independent Spirit Awards, along with ""The Good Girl,"" ""Lovely & Amazing,"" ""Secretary,"" and eventual winner ""Far from Heaven.""  Although it's the least known of these nominees, ""Tully"" can more than hold it's own in this field of fine indie films.
