Kinda like the other Broken Lizard film I've seen, Beerfest.  I have a feeling that those who enjoy BL's humor will enjoy this, and those who don't won't.  The plot is just a setup for gags involving a restaurant wait staff desperately trying to best each other one night.  The gags are hit and miss, but there are so many of them that it's never all that long before the next hit comes along.  A lot of stupid-funny movies lose steam as the joke rate slows to focus on resolving a (usually worthless) plot -- thankfully, that isn't the case here.  Turn off your brain and enjoy.The image and sound are of very good quality.  The colors pop and the dialogue is clear.  Avatar this ain't, but it's more than adequate for the material.The extras are OK.  They include a pair of commentary tracks that ramble across all the usual commentary topics, as well as a video of the Broken Lizard troupe reminiscing about funny experiences they've had while working in restaurants.

It's a wild ride of zany, enjoyable comedy that manages to be both silly and quasi-intelligent at the same time.

And best of all, rather than being a throwaway gross-out comedy, this one is clever enough that it probably deserves repeat viewings.

1327019,A3U0S17XYK8XMJ,B00363WG5K,Alexander Lucard,"[0, 1]","Although nowhere as awesome asSuper TroopersorBeerfest (Unrated Widescreen Edition), The Slammin' Salmon is much better thanPuddle Cruiser,Club Dread (Unrated Extended Edition)orThe Dukes of Hazzard (Unrated Full Screen Edition). As Broken Lizard specializes in what are known as ""late night comedies,"" this film will only appeal to a niche audience, but for those that love their previous works, you'll be happy to know that this contains clever schemes, crazy capers, wacky hijinx and just a bit of gross-out comedy.Michael Clarke Duncan steals the show as Cleon ""Slammin'"" Salmon, the ex boxing heavyweight champion of the world. Not completely insane, he has opened a seafood restaurant named after him. The character of Salmon is hilarious, demented and really makes the movie. The only other ""name"" actor with a large part is Cobie Smulders aka ""Robin Sparkles/Scherbatsky"" fromHow I Met Your Mother: Seasons 1-4, but Vivica A. Fox, Morgan Fairchild and Lance Henriksen all have cameos.The core cast is of course the Broken Lizard Troupe and they all do a great job. Kevin Heffernan plays the manager of The Slammin' Salmon, and he's surprisingly subdued in this role. If you're expecting Farva or Landfill, you'll be a bit disappointed here. Jay Chandrasekhar plays ""nuts"" and its his weirdest role yet. Sadly it's not as beliveable as his other characters that he's played over the years. Paul Soter has a double role in the film as two obnoxious twin brothers, but it's Erik Stolhanske and Steve Lemme who actually make the movie for me as these two always play just a wide array of characters. Steve is Conner, a waiter returning to the Salmon after a failed acting career and Erik plays Guy who is the resident sleazy staff member.In all, I really enjoyed the film and found it to be a keeper. Again, I realize that like most Broken Lizard films, this is only going to appeal to a cult audience, but its definitely worth watching several times just for the sheer weirdness of it all.",4,Another Great Broken Lizard Experience,1273881600,"05 15, 2010",2010,1994,"['nowhere', 'awesome', 'TroopersorBeerfest', 'Unrated', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'Slammin', 'Salmon', 'much', 'better', 'thanPuddle', 'Cruiser', 'Club', 'Dread', 'Unrated', 'Extended', 'Edition', 'orThe', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'Unrated', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Edition', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'what', 'are', 'known', 'late', 'night', 'comedies', 'film', 'will', 'only', 'appeal', 'niche', 'audience', 'love', 'previous', 'works', ""'ll"", 'be', 'happy', 'know', 'clever', 'schemes', 'crazy', 'capers', 'wacky', 'hijinx', 'just', 'bit', 'gross-out', 'comedy.Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'show', 'Cleon', 'Slammin', 'Salmon', 'ex', 'boxing', 'heavyweight', 'champion', 'world', 'Not', 'completely', 'insane', 'opened', 'seafood', 'restaurant', 'named', 'character', 'Salmon', 'hilarious', 'demented', 'really', 'movie', 'only', 'other', 'name', 'actor', 'large', 'part', 'Cobie', 'Smulders', 'aka', 'Robin', 'Sparkles/Scherbatsky', 'fromHow', 'Met', 'Mother', 'Seasons', '1-4', 'Vivica', 'A', 'Fox', 'Morgan', 'Fairchild', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'have', 'cameos.The', 'core', 'cast', 'course', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'Troupe', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'Kevin', 'Heffernan', 'manager', 'Slammin', 'Salmon', 'surprisingly', 'subdued', 'role', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'Farva', 'Landfill', ""'ll"", 'be', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'here', 'Jay', 'Chandrasekhar', 'nuts', 'weirdest', 'role', 'yet', 'Sadly', 'not', 'as', 'beliveable', 'other', 'characters', 'played', 'years', 'Paul', 'Soter', 'double', 'role', 'film', 'two', 'obnoxious', 'twin', 'brothers', 'Erik', 'Stolhanske', 'Steve', 'Lem', 'who', 'actually', 'make', 'movie', 'two', 'always', 'play', 'just', 'wide', 'array', 'characters', 'Steve', 'Conner', 'waiter', 'returning', 'Salmon', 'failed', 'acting', 'career', 'Erik', 'plays', 'Guy', 'who', 'resident', 'sleazy', 'staff', 'member.In', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'found', 'be', 'keeper', 'Again', 'realize', 'most', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'films', 'only', 'going', 'appeal', 'cult', 'audience', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'several', 'times', 'just', 'sheer', 'weirdness']",N/A

1327024,A3QNQQKJTL76H0,B00363WG5K,buru buru piggu,"[0, 1]","The Slammin' Salmon is not one of Broken Lizard's better efforts, compared toSuper TroopersandBeerfest (Unrated) [Blu-ray]. The plot is thin and the jokes tired and predictable. Most of them, you can see coming from a mile away, including some toilet humor (quite literally, it involves a toilet and a diamond ring swallowed by one of the waiters). The problem is that the entire movie is confined to the inside of a restaurant, offering a limited venue for jokes, most of which are stale. With the right cast and right material, a fixed locale such as a small room isn't a handicap (seeMan From Earth [Blu-ray]), but the dialog and jokes in Slammin' Salmon are not smart enough to make it work. I laughed a few times (mostly due to the copious amount of profanities that comes out of Michael Clarke Duncan's mouth), but most of the physical humor and jokes were flat-out old and unfunny.As mentioned, Michael Clarke Duncan plays Slammin' Cleon Salmon, former heavy-weight champion of the world and owner of the eponymous Slammin' Salmon, an upscale Miami restaurant. He is a happy-go-lucky, lovable, foul-mouthed bear of a man most of the time, but when he doesn't get what he wants, he resorts to the threat of egregious bodily harm. Having lost a twenty thousand $ bet to the Yakuza, he must come up with the money that night and tasks his staff with the responsibility. As an incentive, the top earner walks home with a ten thousand $ cash prize while the last place finisher gets a ""broken rib sandwich"". What follows is a series of predictable mishaps, lackluster jokes, and the usual backstabbing shenanigans you've seen in hundreds of other movies.Cleon is really the star of the show. The wait staff isn't very interesting (Jay Chandrasekhar's character ""Nuts"" and the chef Dave are especially under-developed and Guy Metrapedes, who Cleon unfunnily calls ""Meatdrapes"", is just crude and boring). Cleon is a simple (and simple-minded) sort of fellow. He has terrible spelling (""useless with a capital Y""), minces words, and tries to write rap lyrics -- and he does a lot of yelling. Essentially, Cleon is a caricature of Mike Tyson, George Forman, Yogi Berra, and Samuel L. Jackson as ""Angry Black Man"" (see Dave Chappelle's ""Samuel Jackson Beer"" skit). The yelling can be very funny at times. In one scene, he is yelling at his staff and asks rhetorically if they wouldn't rather be on a beach sipping strawberry daiquiris instead, to which he responds: ""Well too bad! Because strawberry daiquiris are for closers, not for p*ssies!"" I laughed out loud at theGlengarry Glen Rossreference and several other F/MF bombs.Despite the testosterone-fueled profanity and anger, Cleon's threats are not entirely believable because he's just too lovable. And despite the Yakuza plot mention at the beginning, they never appear in the film to reinforce the urgency of the threat. One saving grace, however, is that we get to look at the lovely Cobie Smulders and April Bowlby. That doesn't make up for having to see Chandrasekhar's naked butt several times though.If you're really bored and in the mood for Harold & Kumar-esque humor, then this movie might fit the bill.

The only film of theirs that I'd seen before today in its entirety was Super Troopers, which everyone blew way out of proportion and claimed it reached mountains of greatness that the film would never even begin to climb. I skipped all of their other films, but stumbled upon the possession of The Slammin' Salmon thanks to the kindness of Amazon. If your expectations for a film could fall somewhere between nothing and almost nothing, then that's where mine were going into this. Unfortunately, the film still managed to be unfunny in ways I couldn't possibly imagine.The Slammin' Salmon is a lot like the comedy Waiting that came out a few years ago; it has a similar atmosphere and we spend the majority of the film's duration with the wait staff. But if you've never been a waiter, then the film is probably just as unfunny as Waiting was. The roles Will Forte and Lance Henriksen have make the film a little less of a waste of time. Henriksen's nod to The X-Files and Forte's role adding a little bit of heart (but short-lived) to a film that was mostly raunchy sex and fart jokes up until then were easily the highlights.If you're a fan of any of the other Broken Lizard films, Waiting, or ever worked as a waiter, then you may enjoy The Slammin' Salmon. Otherwise I'd recommend watching anything (seriously like anything) else.Special features on the DVD include two commentary tracks, the theatrical trailer and the feature Hellish Kitchens: Art Imitates Restaurant Life.

With the exception of a brief prologue, it all takes place at an upscale restaurant over the course of a single evening, when we see the action from the perspective of a terrified and tyrranized wait staff.  It's a great set-up that plays out like a classical farce.And what a restaurant--""The Slammin' Salmon"" is a fish place with a boxing theme owned by Slammin' Cleon Salmon, former Heavyweight Champion of the World.  The restaurant's ambiance mixes haute cuisine with irremediable tackiness.  The fact that sophisticated people actually patronize this weird place lends a sort of surreal background humor to the film.Michael Clarke Duncan plays the owner, Cleon, as a mixture of Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, and a pit bull.  His affable smiles barely conceal the raging menace bubbling beneath.  He's just dumb enough to be dangerous, the sort of aristocratic idiot familar from classic French and English farces all the way up to the president in Mike Judge's ""Idiocracy.""  Cleon owes his power partly to his accumulated wealth but mostly to his ability to beat the living daylights out of anyone who angers him.  The threat is always there, and we feel it through his anxiety-ridden wait staff.When Cleon loses a wager to some Japanese gangsters, the wait staff is challenged to raise $20,000 in a single night to pay off his debt.  This is far more than the restaurant has ever made before in a single night.  Cleon's long-suffering manager (played by Kevin Heffernan) tries to offer various carrots to reward the highest-producing waiter.  But when these fall short, the stick replaces the carrot.  Cleon adds an incentive--the lowest-producing waiter will get a ""broken-rib sandwich,"" courtesy of Cleon himself.  Now we descend into ""Glengary Glen Ross"" territory, with each of the waiters trying desperately to stay on top, using absurd levels of seduction and flattery on the customers and undercutting the other waiters' efforts.The Broken Lizards are as desperate for laughs as the waiters are for tips, which brings out the idiosyncracies of each character.  The best character is played by Jay Chandresekhar, the obligatory loony who fails to ingest his psych meds and unleashes his inner nut.  We have a slutty waitress who comes on to her customers, gay and straight alike.  And an erstwhile Hollywood star, whose nose job actually lost him the part, who is now reduced to waiting on his former co-stars (including Morgan Fairchild and a barely-recognizable Lance Henrickson).  The other characters are given less to do but they keep the action moving.  I got the sense that everyone really enjoyed being in this film, which made it a pleasure to watch.It's a guilty pleasure, though, with far too many jokes involving threats of ramming various things up various orifices.  If you've watched many films like this one, that side of it may be tedious.  The broad, crude humor that serves as filler gets old.  But I still found myself laughing out loud at times, from the sheer audacity of it all.",4,cool but crude farce,1272067200,"04 24, 2010",2010,3114,"['3', '1/2', 'stars', 'Slammin', 'Salmon', 'comedy', 'work', 'Clerks', 'Office', 'Space', 'funnier', 'exception', 'brief', 'prologue', 'place', 'upscale', 'restaurant', 'course', 'single', 'evening', 'when', 'see', 'action', 'perspective', 'terrified', 'tyrranized', 'wait', 'staff', 'great', 'set-up', 'out', 'classical', 'farce.And', 'what', 'restaurant', 'Slammin', 'Salmon', 'fish', 'place', 'boxing', 'theme', 'owned', 'Slammin', 'Cleon', 'Salmon', 'former', 'Heavyweight', 'Champion', 'World', 'restaurant', 'ambiance', 'mixes', 'haute', 'cuisine', 'irremediable', 'tackiness', 'fact', 'sophisticated', 'people', 'actually', 'patronize', 'weird', 'place', 'sort', 'surreal', 'background', 'humor', 'film.Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'owner', 'Cleon', 'mixture', 'Muhammad', 'Ali', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'pit', 'bull', 'affable', 'smiles', 'barely', 'conceal', 'raging', 'menace', 'bubbling', 'beneath', 'just', 'dumb', 'enough', 'be', 'dangerous', 'sort', 'aristocratic', 'idiot', 'familar', 'classic', 'French', 'English', 'farces', 'way', 'president', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'Idiocracy', 'Cleon', 'power', 'partly', 'accumulated', 'wealth', 'mostly', 'ability', 'beat', 'living', 'daylights', 'anyone', 'who', 'threat', 'always', 'there', 'feel', 'anxiety-ridden', 'wait', 'staff.When', 'Cleon', 'wager', 'Japanese', 'gangsters', 'wait', 'staff', 'challenged', 'raise', '20,000', 'single', 'night', 'pay', 'off', 'debt', 'far', 'more', 'restaurant', 'ever', 'made', 'single', 'night', 'Cleon', 'long-suffering', 'manager', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Heffernan', 'offer', 'various', 'carrots', 'reward', 'highest-producing', 'waiter', 'when', 'fall', 'short', 'stick', 'carrot', 'Cleon', 'incentive', 'lowest-producing', 'waiter', 'will', 'get', 'broken-rib', 'sandwich', 'courtesy', 'Cleon', 'Now', 'descend', 'Glengary', 'Glen', 'Ross', 'territory', 'waiters', 'trying', 'desperately', 'stay', 'top', 'using', 'absurd', 'levels', 'seduction', 'flattery', 'customers', 'undercutting', 'other', 'waiters', 'efforts.The', 'Broken', 'Lizards', 'are', 'desperate', 'laughs', 'waiters', 'are', 'tips', 'out', 'idiosyncracies', 'character', 'best', 'character', 'played', 'Jay', 'Chandresekhar', 'obligatory', 'loony', 'who', 'ingest', 'psych', 'meds', 'inner', 'nut', 'have', 'slutty', 'waitress', 'who', 'customers', 'gay', 'straight', 'alike', 'erstwhile', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'nose', 'job', 'actually', 'lost', 'part', 'who', 'now', 'reduced', 'waiting', 'former', 'co-stars', 'including', 'Morgan', 'Fairchild', 'barely-recognizable', 'Lance', 'Henrickson', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'given', 'less', 'do', 'keep', 'action', 'moving', 'got', 'sense', 'everyone', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'being', 'film', 'made', 'pleasure', 'watch.It', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'jokes', 'involving', 'threats', 'ramming', 'various', 'things', 'up', 'various', 'orifices', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'many', 'films', 'one', 'side', 'may', 'be', 'tedious', 'broad', 'crude', 'humor', 'filler', 'old', 'still', 'found', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'times', 'sheer', 'audacity']",N/A

That's a gagging moment, folks. Not funny at all.

Hoyos,"[0, 0]","Celebrity Boxer Slammin' Cleon Salmon (Michael Clark Duncan who gave an excellent performance as the mysterious John Coffey in Stephen King's ""The Green Mile"") is an egotistical, intellectually challenged bully who owns the Slammin' Salmon, an upscale Miami restaurant.  Cleon is unable to correctly pronounce last names and uses a plethora of words that don't exist.  (He's been punched in the head too many times)  He also has a foul mouth that is irritating.  His entire staff lives in fear of his uncontrollable temper.Cleon becomes indebted to Japanese businessmen.  He must raise $20,000 overnight or lose his restaurant.  The manager offers two tickets to a Nora Jones concert to the waiter or waitress who makes the most tips.  That doesn't provide enough impetus.  Soon the prize is a luxury vacation in a tropical paradise.  However, when Cleon ups the ante to $10,000, there is mayhem among the wait staff.  They backstab and betray one another as they resort to every amoral, underhanded trick to become the #1 waiter or waitress.  The consequences are often hilarious, and sometimes they are heart warming.I must be honest and admit I've never seen any of the other films (such as ""Super Troopers"" and ""Beerfest"") directed by Kevin Heffernan and starring the Broken Lizard Comedy Troupe.  After watching ""The Slammin' Salmon,"" I will definitely have to buy or rent them.  ""The Slammin' Salmon"" is not a parody like the super successful ""Scary Movie"" series or a hormonally driven teen comedy like the outrageous ""American Pie"" series.  The humor, though raunchy at times, is more adult oriented.  This is definitely not a comedy for the entire family to watch.Filmed entirely on a back lot studio, ""The Slammin' Salmon"" has gorgeous set pieces and an attractive cast of young actors playing diverse characters.  There is Carl (Nat Faxon), the timid, bumbling, boyishly chubby manager; Connor (Steve Lemme) who has returned to the wait staff after his failed stint as an actor; the schizophrenic Nuts (Jay Chandrasekhar) who becomes his whacky alter ego Zongo if he doesn't take his meds; the selfish, womanizing Guy (Erik Stolhanske) who is extremely cutthroat; and the kindhearted, albeit drunk, waiter, Donnie, who lives in the shadow of his obnoxiously violent twin brother Dave (both excellently portrayed by Paul Soter).  Faxon, Lemme, Chandrasekhar, Stolhanske and Soter comprise the highly successful Broken Lizard Troupe.The gorgeous blond April Bowlby (who has guest starred on various television series such as ""Two and a Half Men"") is Mia, the determined ballerina student; she won't give up trying to win the prize despite having repeatedly suffered severe facial burns.  The perky, intelligent Tara, a medical student, is played by rising star Cobie Smulders (she portrays Robin Scherbatsky of ""How I Met Your Mother"").  Having stronger morals than her coworkers, Tara is one of my favorite characters in ""The Slammin' Salmon.""  Troublesome customers are portrayed by a host of actors making cameo appearances; they include film icon Morgan Fairchild (still the living Barbie Doll), sexy Vivica A. Fox, Will Forte, Jeff Chase, Sendhil Ramamurthy and the veteran star of innumerable science fiction/horror films, Lance Henriksen.""The Slammin' Salmon"" had some scenes that made me laugh out loud.  (I'll let you have the pleasure of discovering them for yourself.)  I'm definitely keeping this film in my comedy collection to watch whenever I've had a difficult day and need to get my laugh on.  Don't worry, ""The Slammin' Salmon"" is a far better comedy release from Anchor Bay Entertainment than the silly, mediocre horror film parody, ""Stan Helsing,"" which they released in October of 2009.  The kitchen at The Slammin' Salmon is always a terrible mess; don't go there for the food, go there for the laughs.Joseph B.

However, I am a fan of Michael Clarke Duncan and was excited to see him in a comedic role.The Slammin' Salmon is a story about the dysfunctional staff of a restaurant called The Slammin' Salmon.  The story line is quite pathetic.  The restaurant owner, a former boxer named Cleon Salmon.  Mr. Salmon lost a bet to the Yakuza during a match of ""Japanese Albino Hunting"" and needs to come up with 20000 fast.  A contest is created to encourage the wait staff to sell and come up with the money for the owner.  The high stakes in the competition results in various comedic endeavors amongst the staff.While the story line was pretty pathetic, the acting in the movie was surprisingly believable.  The movie is filled with pointless comedy and toilet humor that reminds me much of Office Space and American Pie.  Just as Office Space has a real ring of truth in terms of a window into the corporate world, The Slammin' Salmon really reminds me of my restaurant and kitchen jobs that I used to work at in my younger days.The movie is far from the best thing I have ever seen, but to be honest, I did enjoy it.  It is definitely not a movie for the pre-teen kids.  Personally, I think it would be a good date night movie to sit back with the SO with a bottle of wine and a blanket to cuddle under.

Suffice it to say that, if you don't demand too much, you'll have a good enough time with the modest pleasures of this manic tale of a night behind the scenes at a hip and trendy restaurant, and the efforts of its waiters and waitresses to win a big cash prize from their clueless yet still threatening boss.I enjoyed most of the jokes, the talented and attractive cast, and even found myself admiring the beautiful, chic restaurant set, which for some reason made the jokes and antics work even better (it somehow complemented the funny scenes, or effectively contrasted with them, or something).  Oh, I should mention that the talented and very pretty April Bowlby should get some kind of award for having to go through the bulk of the film in yucky burned-face make-up after a couple of unfortunate mishaps (the restaurant business can be dangerous).  In short, after that last scene with the hot soup, she couldn't simply rely on her looks to sell her scenes, yet she still did a great job making us laugh.""The Slammin' Salmon"" looks sharp and clean on standard DVD,  but there are hardly any extra features.

I'm sure for people who have worked in the food service industry, or the even more narrow high end food service industry, you can stop screaming &#34;they got it wrong.&#34; I dont think the authenticity of the kitchen environment changes the movie in any way.There isn't a lot of character development, as you are pretty much thrown into the restaurant and left to observe the strangeness of the staff and their relationships. The characters are all the standard wait staff cliches. The Smart Girl, The Cute Girl, The Insane Guy, the Actor Guy, The Wimpy Manager....etc. This movie is not original, but it doesn't really need to be. The humor is not in originality, its in the interaction between the characters, the way they play out differently than in other movies about wait staffs.I gave this movie 3 stars because when it was done I had laughed a few times more than other comedies of late but not as much as the other Broken Lizard films. This time out everything seems to be a little less, and maybe this should have been a short film, some spots seems to be drug out or scenes added in for no reason, or story threads that went on longer than they needed to and sort of became less funny.

If you've seen other Broken Lizard comedies then you'll know what to expect. I think this is one of their better offerings, albeit a bit more ""mature"" (though I hesitate to use that word). Before hitting play, one must approach this film recognizing it for what it is: a twisted spoof along the lines of the National Lampoon and Monty Python movies. It's a ridiculous 90 minute round of guilty-pleasure-junk-food-viewing. A movie that meanders into the nonsensical; replete with clever gags, one liners and yes, even the dreaded potty humor. But it's all in good fun.A comedy works for me if there is a steady stream of action and dialogue that make me smile, chuckle or laugh out loud. Slammin' Salmon was a slam dunk for those who gravitate to the silly and bizarre. You can tell the actors enjoyed the well-timed antics and physical comedy that thoroughly exploited the hectic kitchen scenes and the often outrageous exchanges with customers. Michael Clark Duncan, in the role of retired boxer turned restaurant owner Cleon Salmon clearly reveled in his over-the-top persona. There were some clever details inserted into the script and props, ie. a ""Round One!"" boxing door bell that sounded whenever someone entered ""the Champ's"" office. The ""Nuts/Zongo"" character putting his thumbprint on desserts was a hilariously simple interlude. Sure, the gags start to wear a little thin, the pacing could have been less spotty and the climax was a bit predictable.

This movie has more of a 'play' type feel to it, than a regular comedy movie.The entire movie is set within an upscale restaurant, and the waiters are competing for a big cash prize.  To make it even more interesting, everyone is crazy scared of the boss, boxing Champion Cleon Salmon, who is pretty much dangerously insane, but somehow likable.  The Champ has threatened to give the lowest performing waiter a 'broken rib sandwich'  which everyone desperately wants to avoid.  All the comedy pretty much is played from this conflict as they try to trip each other up.  The comedy plays off the characters - it is very character oriented with a several cameos.

1327049,A30IP5D5DLHRPA,B00363WG5K,Kyle Slayzar,"[0, 0]","Most people in the English speaking world have, at some point, worked somewhere in the dreadful world that is the service sector whether in fast food, retail, or restaurants.  Companies like McDonalds, Wal-Mart, Burger King, Pizza Hutt, etc. have become places where a lot of people (myself included), got our start whether it was to pay the bills, get enough money for college, support another, or were just bored and wanted to work (HA!).  For anyone who has worked in such an environment they know that it is, beyond a shadow of a doubt, absolute hell.There are many films that depict said hell such as Clerks I and II, Waiting I and II, and Employee of the Month (albeit poorly).  The Slammin' Salmon ranks almost among the aforementioned films with it's over-exaggerated antics and jokes, but still provides a decent film experience as long as you only rented the DVD or borrowed it from another.Slammin' Salmon was produced by the Broken Lizard Comedy Troupe, known for their belly-busting comedies such as Super Troopers and... er... Super Troopers.  When I first glanced at the cover, I immediately recognized the entire cast as the lovable idiots from Super Troopers and quickly took it home to watch it.  After watching The Slammin' Salmon, I realized that The Broken Lizard Comedy Troupe still hasn't quite figured out how to make a film as good as Super Troopers.The film's premise is a simple one that has been used a lot; business is on the verge of going under due to the financial mismanagement of the owner and he relies on a big night to save his backside.  Jokes, antics, and banter all along the way.  Roll credits.Going back to my original statement on films depicting the mundane service sector jobs, films doing just that need to have plenty of moments that the audience can relate to.  These moments need to incite a ""yup, been there"" reaction and, thus, making it more appealing since most of us Americans have indeed been there.  The Slammin' Salmon starts out doing just that with a waiter just forcing a grin and pleasant attitude through a d-bag of a customer that deserved to have his food laced with laxative and Comet rather than be granted the royal treatment.After the initial scene, the ability for the audience to relate to the film goes completely out the window.The cast of characters is diverse enough, but not entirely relative due to their exaggerated natures whether it's a overly-medicated misfit that goes by the moonlighting name ""Zongo,"" a washed up actor, or the med-school student using tips to pay her tuition.  The latter character is the most realistic, but not relative enough for the general audience.  Had Broken Lizard kept the relations alive from the intro onward, The Slammin' Salmon could have competed with Waiting, which I think was a better depiction of those working in restaurants.The jokes were OK, I genuinely laughed a few times but not like I did when I saw the 'bear costume' in Super Troopers.  It's just not a belly buster.  If anything, some of the jokes are, like the characters, overly exaggerated if not over used.  It becomes monotonous, which a comedy cannot be.The acting was OK as well.  I love the Broken Lizard crew, I think they have the raw talent needed to make more awesome films, but Michael Duncan Clark performed way better than they did.  His over-the-top antics were the only ones that actually made sense and were genuinely funny.All in all, The Slammin' Salmon could have been a great film but, once again, Broken Lizard comes up short and will be forever doomed as all their films will be measured against the awesomeness that is Super Troopers... no one even ordered a ""liter of cola,"" now THAT would have been a good gag.All in all, a 75%.Solid C movie.",3,A Moderately Solid Slammin' of a Movie From Broken Lizard,1273363200,"05 9, 2010",2010,3748,"['Most', 'people', 'English', 'speaking', 'world', 'have', 'point', 'worked', 'somewhere', 'dreadful', 'world', 'service', 'sector', 'fast', 'food', 'retail', 'restaurants', 'Companies', 'McDonalds', 'Wal-Mart', 'Burger', 'King', 'Pizza', 'Hutt', 'etc', 'have', 'become', 'places', 'where', 'lot', 'people', 'included', 'got', 'start', 'was', 'pay', 'bills', 'get', 'enough', 'money', 'college', 'support', 'were', 'just', 'bored', 'wanted', 'work', 'HA', 'anyone', 'who', 'worked', 'such', 'environment', 'know', 'shadow', 'doubt', 'absolute', 'are', 'many', 'films', 'depict', 'said', 'hell', 'such', 'Clerks', 'II', 'Waiting', 'II', 'Employee', 'Month', 'poorly', 'Slammin', 'Salmon', 'almost', 'aforementioned', 'films', 'over-exaggerated', 'antics', 'jokes', 'still', 'decent', 'film', 'experience', 'as', 'long', 'only', 'rented', 'DVD', 'borrowed', 'another.Slammin', 'Salmon', 'was', 'produced', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'Comedy', 'Troupe', 'known', 'belly-busting', 'comedies', 'such', 'Super', 'Troopers', 'er', 'Super', 'Troopers', 'When', 'first', 'glanced', 'cover', 'immediately', 'recognized', 'entire', 'cast', 'lovable', 'idiots', 'Super', 'Troopers', 'quickly', 'took', 'home', 'watch', 'watching', 'Slammin', 'Salmon', 'realized', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'Comedy', 'Troupe', 'still', ""n't"", 'quite', 'figured', 'out', 'how', 'make', 'film', 'as', 'good', 'Super', 'Troopers.The', 'film', 'premise', 'simple', 'one', 'been', 'used', 'lot', 'business', 'verge', 'going', 'due', 'financial', 'mismanagement', 'owner', 'big', 'night', 'save', 'backside', 'Jokes', 'antics', 'banter', 'way', 'Roll', 'credits.Going', 'back', 'original', 'statement', 'films', 'depicting', 'mundane', 'service', 'sector', 'jobs', 'films', 'doing', 'just', 'need', 'have', 'plenty', 'moments', 'audience', 'can', 'relate', 'moments', 'need', 'incite', 'yup', 'been', 'reaction', 'thus', 'making', 'more', 'appealing', 'most', 'Americans', 'have', 'indeed', 'been', 'there', 'Slammin', 'Salmon', 'out', 'doing', 'just', 'waiter', 'just', 'forcing', 'grin', 'pleasant', 'attitude', 'd-bag', 'customer', 'deserved', 'have', 'food', 'laced', 'laxative', 'Comet', 'rather', 'be', 'granted', 'royal', 'treatment.After', 'initial', 'scene', 'ability', 'audience', 'relate', 'film', 'completely', 'window.The', 'cast', 'characters', 'diverse', 'enough', 'not', 'entirely', 'relative', 'due', 'exaggerated', 'natures', 'overly-medicated', 'misfit', 'moonlighting', 'name', 'Zongo', 'washed', 'up', 'actor', 'med-school', 'student', 'using', 'tips', 'pay', 'tuition', 'latter', 'character', 'most', 'realistic', 'not', 'relative', 'enough', 'general', 'audience', 'Had', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'kept', 'relations', 'alive', 'intro', 'onward', 'Slammin', 'Salmon', 'could', 'have', 'competed', 'Waiting', 'think', 'was', 'better', 'depiction', 'working', 'restaurants.The', 'jokes', 'were', 'OK', 'genuinely', 'laughed', 'few', 'times', 'not', 'did', 'when', 'saw', ""'bear"", 'costume', 'Super', 'Troopers', 'just', 'not', 'belly', 'buster', 'anything', 'jokes', 'are', 'characters', 'overly', 'exaggerated', 'not', 'used', 'monotonous', 'comedy', 'can', 'not', 'be.The', 'acting', 'was', 'OK', 'as', 'well', 'love', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'crew', 'think', 'have', 'raw', 'talent', 'needed', 'make', 'more', 'awesome', 'films', 'Michael', 'Duncan', 'Clark', 'performed', 'way', 'better', 'did', 'over-the-top', 'antics', 'were', 'only', 'ones', 'actually', 'made', 'sense', 'were', 'genuinely', 'funny.All', 'Slammin', 'Salmon', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'film', 'once', 'again', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'up', 'short', 'will', 'be', 'forever', 'doomed', 'films', 'will', 'be', 'measured', 'awesomeness', 'Super', 'Troopers', 'one', 'even', 'ordered', 'liter', 'cola', 'now', 'THAT', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'gag.All', '75', '%', '.Solid', 'C', 'movie']",N/A

To pay off a gambling debt, the boss sets up a competition among his staff of waiters and waitresses to see who can bring in the most money in a 24-hour period.  Chaos and mayhem ensue.As directed by Kevin Heffernan (who also appears, alongside his fellow Broken Lizard writers and actors, as one of the waiters), ""The Slammin' Salmon"" is not the most sophisticated or highbrow comedy you'll ever see, but its breezy style and high-energy performances go a long way towards making something uniquely unhinged and genuinely fun out of the material.  Despite all the crazy antics, the movie never has to strain too hard to get its laughs, and even when the jokes clatter to the floor - as they are wont to do from time to time - the cast is always there to pick up the pieces and run with them.A few well-known faces - Will Forte, Vivica A.

But the plot sounded funny so I decided to get it.  It wasn't the funniest movie I've seen but it was amusing and occasionally made me laugh out loud.  If you are already a fan of the Broken Lizard movies, I think you will like it.  The prime demographic for this is probably guys in their 20s/30s.Former boxing champion Cleon Salmon (Michael Clarke Duncan), owner of the Slammin' Salmon restaurant and the terror of his employees, has lost a bet with a gangster and tells his hapless manager Rich (director Kevin Heffernan) the restaurant needs to bring in $20,000 that night or he will lose the restaurant.  But the manager doesn't tell the waiters the real story; he just announces a contest to see who can bring in the most money.  When the initial prize isn't motivating enough, Rich comes up with something better, which heats up the competition but later in the evening the boss announces the winner will get $10,000 and the loser a ""broken rib sandwich.""  As the prize for winning gets higher (and the consequences for losing get greater), the staff gets more cutthroat in trying to outsell the others.The biggest thing I wondered about was whether the comedy would be too crude for me and in that respect it was better than expected.  The worst of it was the frequent threat to shove something up a bodily orifice; I could have done with significantly fewer of those but it wasn't bad enough to put me off the movie.  Sometimes the movie felt like an extended sketch comedy bit or improvisation session and I wished the writers had worked more on the script. (A series of jokes involving daylight savings time fell flat for me).  There was some good funny physical comedy that was even funnier when it was unexpected. The cast did a pretty good job playing the expected restaurant characters - temperamental chef, waiters who are really actors, students, etc. working to pay the bills.  The two standout characters were Salmon and the waiter Nuts.There were two things that kept me from really liking this movie:  first and foremost, I like my comedy to be really witty (or really goofy).  If the writing is good, I'm happy but the script was too uneven and a little unfocussed.  The second was that I didn't get a chance to care about the characters - maybe because there were too many of them but I think more because the plot was centered more on the gags than on the characters.",3,3.5 stars Broken Lizard fans will like this comedy,1272240000,"04 26, 2010",2010,2509,"['have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'group', 'earlier', 'movies', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'kind', 'comedy', 'expect', 'plot', 'sounded', 'funny', 'decided', 'get', 'was', ""n't"", 'funniest', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'was', 'amusing', 'occasionally', 'made', 'out', 'loud', 'are', 'already', 'fan', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'movies', 'think', 'will', 'like', 'prime', 'demographic', 'probably', 'guys', '20s/30s.Former', 'boxing', 'champion', 'Cleon', 'Salmon', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'owner', 'Slammin', 'Salmon', 'restaurant', 'terror', 'employees', 'lost', 'bet', 'gangster', 'hapless', 'manager', 'Rich', 'director', 'Kevin', 'Heffernan', 'restaurant', 'bring', '20,000', 'night', 'will', 'lose', 'restaurant', 'manager', ""n't"", 'tell', 'waiters', 'real', 'story', 'just', 'contest', 'see', 'who', 'can', 'bring', 'most', 'money', 'When', 'initial', 'prize', ""n't"", 'motivating', 'enough', 'Rich', 'up', 'something', 'better', 'up', 'competition', 'later', 'evening', 'boss', 'winner', 'will', 'get', '10,000', 'loser', 'broken', 'rib', 'sandwich', 'prize', 'winning', 'higher', 'consequences', 'losing', 'get', 'greater', 'staff', 'more', 'cutthroat', 'trying', 'outsell', 'others.The', 'biggest', 'thing', 'wondered', 'was', 'comedy', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'crude', 'respect', 'was', 'better', 'expected', 'worst', 'was', 'frequent', 'threat', 'shove', 'something', 'up', 'bodily', 'orifice', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'significantly', 'fewer', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'put', 'off', 'movie', 'Sometimes', 'movie', 'felt', 'extended', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'bit', 'improvisation', 'session', 'wished', 'writers', 'had', 'worked', 'more', 'script', 'series', 'jokes', 'involving', 'daylight', 'savings', 'time', 'fell', 'flat', 'was', 'good', 'funny', 'physical', 'comedy', 'was', 'even', 'funnier', 'when', 'was', 'unexpected', 'cast', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'expected', 'restaurant', 'characters', 'temperamental', 'chef', 'waiters', 'who', 'are', 'really', 'actors', 'students', 'etc', 'working', 'pay', 'bills', 'two', 'standout', 'characters', 'were', 'Salmon', 'waiter', 'Nuts.There', 'were', 'two', 'things', 'kept', 'really', 'liking', 'movie', 'first', 'foremost', 'like', 'comedy', 'be', 'really', 'witty', 'really', 'goofy', 'writing', 'good', ""'m"", 'happy', 'script', 'was', 'too', 'uneven', 'little', 'unfocussed', 'second', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'care', 'characters', 'maybe', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'think', 'more', 'plot', 'was', 'centered', 'more', 'gags', 'characters']",N/A

The premise here is that the Broken Lizard troupe, along with a few token females, work as servers at a restaurant under the direction of Michael Clarke Duncan's character, a none-too-bright former boxer named Cleon Salmon. Salmon ends up owing a bunch of money to the Yakuza, and the servers are given one night to raise the money he requires. The premise isn't so great, but the other Broken Lizard movies aren't exactly known for their brilliant plots, either. However, whereas the other BL movies are (IMO) well-written comedies, this one relies mostly on hackneyed gags (if I never see another movie where an engagement ring travels through someone or something's intestinal tract, it'll be too soon), and much of the timing seems off.The best element of The Slammin' Salmon, and the one that most consistently brings the funny, is Michael Clarke Duncan. His blissfully punchdrunk Salmon is the main reason why this movie is worth watching. If you like the other Broken Lizard movies, I'd say this one is a solid rental.

(Unrated and Raw) [Blu-ray]) though what I got instead wasn't too bad.I've already given you the idea of what I was expecting with the film, but just to further confirm what I had hoped for, my daughter asked if I had the American Pie films on DVD/Blu-ray (I have them on DVD, not Blu-ray as they've not been released on Blu-ray yet) because she was looking for something silly to watch and laugh at for an evening movie.  While I told her I had those films, I mentioned that I also had the copy of The Slammin' Salmon that I wanted to watch and hoped that it would be reasonably humorous.Reasonably humorous is about all that it delivered, but given how truly bad some films I have seen have been, I put that at an acceptable mark.  There are some funny moments in the film, mostly based around Michael Clarke Duncan's foul-mouthed rants (those had my daughter snickering), and a few physical gags in the film as well, but I don't see this one coming close to a comedy classic.  It's more likely to become a film that most people will never see, at least until it shows up in heavy rotation on say Comedy Central.Fairly predictable, made all the more so thanks to clips shown in the background of the disc's menu (stupid move studio!!, never give away the better parts of your film with a loop of clips in the background of the disc menu.  A static image would have been far better, perhaps the one that is shown on the box artwork).  There are a few cameos that add to the fun, and some viewers may enjoy the fun of seeing a few of the stars and recognizing them from other places.Roughly 100 minutes of film with a few special features tossed in (two commentary tracks from the Broken Lizard Comedy Troupe who are featured in the film, and a featurette as well).  Rated R, mostly for the language.Err on the side of caution if you're thinking of watching this one and go Unbox first.",3,"Not quite what I had hoped for, but not bad either...",1272758400,"05 2, 2010",2010,2046,"['short', 'description', 'had', 'expected', 'Slammin', 'Salmon', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'more', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'warmed', 'up', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'Waiting', 'Unrated', 'Raw', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'what', 'got', 'instead', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad.I', ""'ve"", 'already', 'given', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'film', 'just', 'further', 'confirm', 'what', 'had', 'hoped', 'daughter', 'asked', 'had', 'American', 'Pie', 'films', 'DVD/Blu-ray', 'have', 'DVD', 'not', 'Blu-ray', ""'ve"", 'not', 'been', 'released', 'Blu-ray', 'yet', 'was', 'looking', 'something', 'silly', 'watch', 'laugh', 'evening', 'movie', 'told', 'had', 'films', 'mentioned', 'also', 'had', 'copy', 'Slammin', 'Salmon', 'wanted', 'watch', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'reasonably', 'humorous.Reasonably', 'humorous', 'delivered', 'given', 'how', 'truly', 'bad', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'acceptable', 'mark', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'film', 'mostly', 'based', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'foul-mouthed', 'rants', 'had', 'daughter', 'snickering', 'few', 'physical', 'gags', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'one', 'coming', 'close', 'comedy', 'classic', 'more', 'likely', 'become', 'film', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'least', 'up', 'heavy', 'rotation', 'say', 'Comedy', 'Central.Fairly', 'predictable', 'made', 'more', 'so', 'thanks', 'clips', 'shown', 'background', 'disc', 'menu', 'stupid', 'move', 'studio', 'never', 'give', 'away', 'better', 'parts', 'film', 'loop', 'clips', 'background', 'disc', 'menu', 'A', 'static', 'image', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'better', 'perhaps', 'one', 'shown', 'box', 'artwork', 'are', 'few', 'cameos', 'fun', 'viewers', 'may', 'enjoy', 'fun', 'seeing', 'few', 'stars', 'recognizing', 'other', 'places.Roughly', '100', 'minutes', 'film', 'few', 'special', 'features', 'tossed', 'two', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'Comedy', 'Troupe', 'who', 'are', 'featured', 'film', 'featurette', 'as', 'well', 'Rated', 'R', 'mostly', 'language.Err', 'side', 'caution', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'watching', 'one', 'go', 'Unbox', 'first']",N/A

""The Slammin' Salmon"" is one of those mediocrities. They wanted to make the ""Animal House"" of restaurant movies, but after the superiorWaiting..., this is just mildly funny.The winner and still champion Cleon Salmon is an ex-prize fighter (played by Michael Clarke Duncan as a mash-up of Mike Tyson, George Foreman and every brain addled athlete you've ever seen) who loses a bet. If he doesn't raise enough to pay it off in one night, he'll lose his namesake shop. The hapless waitstaff is challenged with a cash reward to make this night a cash blast (and the loser gets a beatdown). Hi-jinks ensue.Duncan has the bulk of the laughs, as the juvenile muscle head who seems just smart enough to run the business but blurts out phrases like ""Useless with a capital Y!"" when he gets angry. His staff are terrified of him, but need the bucks. And one of them, the always reliable BL member Jay Chandrasekhar, has forgotten to take his mood meds. A host of actors make cameos (SNL's Will Forte, Heroes' Sendhil Ramamurthy, Morgan Fairchild) that mostly elicit mild chuckles. For the most part, the movie works.However, you can watch this and soon understand why it didn't make much of a theatrical splash. The jokes are mild and somewhat predictable, and there's no real major payoff. One gets the feeling that a bleeped version of this is going to end up on basic cable in heavy rotation, soon.
