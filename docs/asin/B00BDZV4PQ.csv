Some of the episodes in the series had Quinn Martin as audio supervisor (later producer of TV's The Fugitive) and I've found one (Oil Lease, Season Two) with the story written by Gene Roddenberry (Star Trek).Broderick Crawford had a little problem with the bottle, so the irony is that, because of his series of DUI's, when he's doing the driving, it is often on private backroads (no license).

Alcoholic, multiple DUI arrests, bloated and overweight, best actor Oscar winner for ""All The King's Men,"" Crawford doesn't play gruff, no-time-for-nonsense, lead character Dan Matthews so much as he channels every middle-aged cop who ever had to spend most of his weary life keeping the highways clean of punks and not-as-smart-as-they-think-they-are-hoodlums. Quick thinking, quick speaking (Crawford fires off the dialogue like bullets from a machine gun; the writers had to write longer scripts because of Crawford's rapid delivery), with an ""I've seen scum like you a thousand times before Mac, and if you think you can fool me, you're stupider than you look"" attitude, Crawford breathes life into bland, uninspired scripts. When Crawford isn't in a scene, you get stuck with grade ""D"" actors and actresses who, I hope, had another career to fall back on. Many of those scenes would be mind-numbing if they went on any longer than they do. But Crawford inevitably leaps back into the scene with all the energy and steely-eyed determination of a battalion of marines heading off to battle and you quickly forget how bad the other actors are. Is it a great series? No. Is it great FUN if you love retro TV (Hey! Look at the cars! The two-way radio!)? YES.

1625996,AILAB4OYB6HNI,B00BDZV4PQ,KoneFire,"[3, 5]","There is a flaw in season 3, at least in the two sets that I had received. Not the flaw some of the other reviews are talking about. If you notice on the box and the disc cover, of Discs 1-5 in Season 3 of Highway Patrol, on Disc 1 it shows that there is suppose to be only 7 shows, and each disc thereafter, has 8 shows. No problem. However, the flaw that bothered me is the shows are not all correctly listed on the disc cover and the box, in relation to what is on the menu and is actually recorded on the discs. For example, on Disc 2 on the box it shows the first show as ""Hot Dust"" but on the disc the episode ""Hot Dust"" is the last show on disc 1. So, in reality Disc 2 starts with ""Witness Wife"" and ends with ""Slain Cabby"" instead of ""Mother's March"". In essence, each disc has the first episode moved over to the previous disc. So, I went and checked to make sure that season 3, was complete which it is. I want my discs to match the cover and the box that they are suppose to be in. The outcome is its 8 episode's on Discs 1-4 and on Disc 5 it has 7 shows, which has I above is fine. Its just that they are misplaced.So I contacted Amazon, and asked them could they give me a replacement, considering, I had to wait for seasons 2 and 3 for sometime. It surprised me as I received season 4 on its release date and I was very impressed. Also there is another issue with the hubs in the disc case not being secure, mostly in season 3. Where you open the case, the first three discs that are stacked, they were moving loose in the disc case. That causes scratches on the discs, but that is minor. The biggest issue for me was the order of the episodes, not matching. However, also this happened in the replacement set. I kind of expected it would be. As it seemed to be a manufacture error where so many of them in a batch were printed up like that. I asked to them to send them from another distribution center but they did not. It came from the same area in Philadelphia. So, I returned the replacement set on Friday, and kept the original set. Since Amazon did honor my request for a concession, and because I wanted to keep the other set, since this show is difficult to get, and wanted the complete series. I will still give this product a 4 because the set still played well, considering the price. Frankly, If I bought this elsewhere, I would have to pay much more money to get this unless one purchased bootlegged discs, but those can be expensive, which I have from other places, and are a total rip. If there should be more like this they would  need to reprint the discs or change the box, and the disc sleeves to match what is on the actual discs. Still a great favorite of mine, and I love Broderick Crawford, he is great in anything he plays.",4,Re: Highway Patrol Season 3- A different flaw,1367107200,"04 28, 2013",2013,2763,"['flaw', 'season', '3', 'least', 'two', 'sets', 'had', 'received', 'Not', 'flaw', 'other', 'reviews', 'are', 'talking', 'notice', 'box', 'disc', 'cover', 'Discs', '1-5', 'Season', '3', 'Highway', 'Patrol', 'Disc', '1', 'suppose', 'be', 'only', '7', 'shows', 'disc', 'thereafter', '8', 'shows', 'problem', 'However', 'flaw', 'bothered', 'shows', 'are', 'not', 'correctly', 'listed', 'disc', 'cover', 'box', 'relation', 'what', 'menu', 'actually', 'recorded', 'discs', 'example', 'Disc', '2', 'box', 'first', 'show', 'Hot', 'Dust', 'disc', 'episode', 'Hot', 'Dust', 'last', 'show', 'disc', '1', 'So', 'reality', 'Disc', '2', 'Witness', 'Wife', 'Slain', 'Cabby', 'instead', 'Mother', 'March', 'essence', 'disc', 'first', 'episode', 'moved', 'over', 'previous', 'disc', 'So', 'went', 'checked', 'make', 'sure', 'season', '3', 'was', 'complete', 'want', 'discs', 'match', 'cover', 'box', 'are', 'suppose', 'be', 'outcome', '8', 'episode', 'Discs', '1-4', 'Disc', '5', '7', 'shows', 'above', 'fine', 'just', 'are', 'misplaced.So', 'contacted', 'Amazon', 'asked', 'could', 'give', 'replacement', 'considering', 'had', 'wait', 'seasons', '2', '3', 'sometime', 'surprised', 'received', 'season', '4', 'release', 'date', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'Also', 'issue', 'hubs', 'disc', 'case', 'not', 'being', 'secure', 'mostly', 'season', '3', 'Where', 'open', 'case', 'first', 'three', 'discs', 'are', 'stacked', 'were', 'moving', 'loose', 'disc', 'case', 'scratches', 'discs', 'minor', 'biggest', 'issue', 'was', 'order', 'episodes', 'not', 'matching', 'However', 'also', 'happened', 'replacement', 'set', 'kind', 'expected', 'would', 'be', 'seemed', 'be', 'manufacture', 'error', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'batch', 'were', 'printed', 'up', 'asked', 'send', 'distribution', 'center', 'did', 'not', 'came', 'same', 'area', 'Philadelphia', 'So', 'returned', 'replacement', 'set', 'Friday', 'kept', 'original', 'set', 'Amazon', 'did', 'honor', 'request', 'concession', 'wanted', 'keep', 'other', 'set', 'show', 'difficult', 'get', 'wanted', 'complete', 'series', 'will', 'still', 'give', 'product', '4', 'set', 'still', 'played', 'well', 'considering', 'price', 'Frankly', 'bought', 'elsewhere', 'would', 'have', 'pay', 'much', 'more', 'money', 'get', 'one', 'purchased', 'bootlegged', 'discs', 'can', 'be', 'expensive', 'have', 'other', 'places', 'are', 'total', 'rip', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'would', 'need', 'reprint', 'discs', 'change', 'box', 'disc', 'match', 'what', 'actual', 'discs', 'Still', 'great', 'favorite', 'mine', 'love', 'Broderick', 'Crawford', 'great', 'anything']",Highway Patrol Complete Season 3

It's a good thing that this series came out long before the computer age, or ""2150"" (the unit number of Chief Dan Matthews) would end up being the pin number of choice for nave fans who would then wonder why their accounts were getting raided. And as Stephen King observed in his novel ""It"", one of the earliest examples of an overweight adventure hero in fiction if you don't count Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe. And if Matthews was a bit of a micro-manager the way he participated personally in arrests (setting an example for the original ""Hawaii Five-O's"" Steve McGarrett)--Matthews was also (as King observed) a tough guy who took no guff from anyone. Let's see if I can remember the narrated intro; ""Whenever the laws of any state are broken, a duly-authorized organization swings into action. It may be called the State Police, the State Troopers, the Militia, the Rangers...or the Highway Patrol. These are the stories of the men who enforce our state laws."" One ongoing sight gag I used to always notice was how the front ends of Ford police cars used in the series would do this slight ""nose dive"" when the units came to a halt. Bad shocks, maybe?But this series could never have been successful today, since the medical establishment with great fanfare declared obesity to be the greatest American health problem.

The Highway Patrol in this series serves as general police force, in addition to patrolling the highways.Someone has robbed your store and taken your 10 year old deaf-mute daughter hostage? Call the Highway Patrol!Kids play with guns and someone gets hurt? Call the Highway Patrol!Someone is blackmailing your husband? Call the Highway Patrol!This was one of my favorite after-school reruns in the early 60's,and I've waited almost 50 years to see it again.  It was worth the wait!  I started with Season 3, because it was the least expensive on the day I ordered from Amazon, and I wanted to see if it was as good as I remembered before I splurged on the more expensive seasons. It turns out that it is better than I recalled!!! Here are things I like about it--in no particular order:1.  Very good picture and sound quality (way better than when I watched it on tv in the rabbit ears/pre-cable days).  I did not have any quality issues.2.  Excellent storylines/writing--a complete mystery/crime in only 25 minutes--no wonder Broderick Crawford talks so fast.3.  Outstanding acting/casting.  Broderick Crawford is so great, and many of the bit players are people I recognize from Perry Mason and other late-50's shows. Some even became more famous - that was a very young Leonard Nimoy in the ""Hot Dust"" episode!4.  Unexpected examples of strong roles/equal rights for women. In Highway Patrol, women criminals con and kill people, are the brains behind complicated criminal enterprises, and sometimes outsmart the police, just like their male counterparts (and sometimes are even better at it!).  Women officers are called in on dangerous decoy assignments and are as tough as the men.5.  The 30-minute format is great for watching while doing short tasks, like paying the bills; and the episodes are standalone, so you don't need to know a backstory.6.  The 2 plastic cases come in a cool matching heavy duty decorated cardboard box.
