Establish men as bumbling inept, chronically erect baboons, and this is supposed to make us laugh til it hurts?Simple fact, females are ""receptive to sex"" around ovulation. That's it. They are covninced that they  have utterly no obligation to their husbands ongoing, almost daily need for sex.

Oh, and if you think it's bad in their 30's and 40's...wait til menopause and vaginal atrophy! This movie is designed to hold men up to mockery and ridicule..and to excuse and justify the monumental failure of women in the marriage bed...and it's epidemic. Shame on all wives who think of their husbands needs very rarely if at all.

1400500,A2582KMXLK2P06,B004EPYZS0,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Hall Pass was relatively boring.  The humor was never really consistent or exciting enough to please me.The storyline is about two men who are granted fictional hall passes by their wives that enables them to do whatever they want for exactly one week.  These hall passes were given to the husbands after they screwed up and got into a fight with their wives.Of course the focus here is on sex since one of the wives brought to their husbands attention that the only thing men think about is sex.  I liked the response by the husband ""It's because we're wired for sex!""So what do these men do with their hall pass?  They attend adult parties and try to score with the ladies and... that's about the only thing they really do... throughout the entire film.  WAY too much storyline downtime for me.This is most certainly a comedy intended for viewers 40 years or older because if you're young like me, you won't find much in the way of humor or entertainment here.  The jokes are in between intelligent and juvenile, which isn't a problem in itself- it's that the storyline never picks up and GOES anywhere particularly amazing.  The movie feels like it's stuck in a loop where it *tries* to pick up and progress, but always falls back to a comfortable, forgettable groove.Alright, there's really only two segments that seemed memorable to me.  The first is when one of the men is pleasuring himself in his parked vehicle while listening to rock music and the cops drive by and witness this dirty act taking place, and the other funny part is near the end during a car chase segment and there's a guy on the roof of the vehicle swinging a club at the windows while the cops persue after the car.  That's about all she wrote as far as laughs are concerned.I'm noticing that Owen Wilson is really growing older.  I've never noticed it before.  We all grow older of course so I'm not necessarily complaining about it.  On the flipside it's not only remarkable that Christina Applegate still looks young, she's also as attractive as ever.  I'm starting to develop a thing for Jenna Fischer as well.Overall, short on the actual laughs turns out to be this movies downfall, but for older folks out there searching for a mild comedy, you may find something appealing here.

Their wives grant them this ""hall pass"" after getting fed up with all their ""girl ogling"" and endless focus on sex, sex, sex.The idea is, take a week off from marriage, and get it all out of your system, guys!That's a good set-up for a movie if ever I heard one.We can kind of guess what follows.  The guys suddenly lose their bravado, and end up eating a huge meal at Applebees instead of cruising for chicks.

It definitely had some ROFL moments in it.  Was the whole thing hilarious? No.  Did it stay funny enough to keep my interest? Yes.

It has its moments, but is no Me, Myself, and Irene IMO...There is an extended cut of the film (Enlarged Edition) which runs approx 6 minutes longer and has an additional 8 scenes. Sadly, other than one in particular.. the scenes are nothing too special nor do they change the film drastically. The movie is a mixture of comedy and seriousness (more towards the end). Sometimes the serious scenes outweigh the funny ones..The additional scenes that are added in the extended version are listed below:1) 30 min. Day One: The guys pick up Gary from the house. Apparently, his wife doesn't know about their plans because he climbs out of the first floor window. He suddenly falls down and limps the rest of the way to the car..2) 43 min. Day Three: Rick and Fred finally start to put some effort in their pick-up attempts and are standing in front of a hip club. At first, the doorman doesn't want to let them in, however, they bribe him with 50 dollars. Still, he thinks that he might lose his job if he lets them go inside. The camera then cuts to Rick, Fred, and the doorman (who just lost his job) as they all eat a hot dog. =)3) 47 min. Day Five: Rick has lunch and leaves a message on his wife's voicemail inbox. He says that he misses her and the kids. Then, the waitress brings him a free dessert made by the cookee. Rick looks around for her but suddenly, the cookee says that the dessert was meant for the other blond guy the cookee apparently has the hots for. Rick looks sad.Cut to the office. Rick tries some online dating but again doesn't really succeed. Fred thinks that it's not the best idea to use a photo that shows Rick with his wife and family. Suddenly, Fred comes up with an idea that is to backfire later on. Apparently, they can't make strange women like them enough to sleep with them, so they should try to hit on women they already know.Subsequently he visits one of his old friends - Missy - and brings her some Greek food to break the ice; he does that because he rememered that her last name had a Greek origin. Too bad that it was her ex-husband's name. Fred explains her how his vacation week from his marraige works and hopes to be able to sleep with Missy. However, she's not really satisfied with his clumsy hit on and slams the door in front of him. Fred is frustrated and doesn't understand why she did this. Not too funny..4) 67 min. Day 6: Rick tries to impress Leigh (the hot blonde from the coffee shop) in the club by putting a huge snake around his neck. After a quick cut we see that this wasn't the best idea. This is the funniest additional scene, hands down..5) 68 min. Day 6: Rick dances on the bar without wearing a shirt. In the extended version he also breaks a glass.6) 69 min. Day 6: Rick's bill in the Club adds up to 1400 dollars because the drinks are unbelievably expensive. He tries to skip out on the tab but doesn't succeed.7) 69 min. Day 6: Rick shouts to the bartender that he shouldn't dare to put a tip on their bill.8) 69 min. Day 6: During the scene transition the theatrical version instead shows the women's motel.All and all, nothing too much added that makes me want to just buy the combo pack with extended version..If you end up with just the theatrical version, I'd say your just fine and are not missing much.

1400516,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B004EPYZS0,C. Sawin,"[3, 5]","The Farrelly brothers hit a high point with Dumb and Dumber (which is kind of sad since that was their debut as filmmakers), but it seems like they've been on a downward spiral ever since. There's Something About Mary was probably more popular and there was a little bit of buzz surrounding Me, Myself, and Irene, but everything else the Farrelly brothers have done have either fallen under the radar or everyone has forgotten about for a good reason (i.e. Shallow Hal). So along comes Hall Pass, the first Farrelly brothers feature film in four years. The trailers and TV spots did seem to give the impression that the film would at least be fun and entertaining and the film turns out to be funnier than some may expect, but Hall Pass tends to come up a little short in its execution.As you can probably guess, Hall Pass gets pretty over the top and raunchy at times. The Farrelly brothers have become notorious for that type of humor. So if getting high off of pot brownies and defecating on a golf course or trying to figure out what ""fake chow"" means doesn't sound like a good time to you, then Hall Pass probably isn't the type of movie you want to see. You'll probably be walking out around the time Rick wakes up in the jacuzzi at Leigh's gym or once you realize what ""Knight Rider"" refers to. The film also felt like it was trying too hard to get laughs the majority of the time. There would be this big elaborate scene where Rick and Fred would try to get laid and it would backfire, but it didn't feel genuinely funny. I found myself laughing at the way certain lines were said in the film and facial expressions more than anything else. The finale of the film also feels really anticlimactic. Events in the film escalate in ridiculousness as the film progresses. The Hangover made something like that work, but you at least had a naked, Korean guy in the trunk waiting to hit you in the head with a crowbar and make the rest of the film fairly unpredictable. Hall Pass tries to cram action, drama, sex, a car chase, and a heartfelt speech into its conclusion. It was like the Farrelly brothers wanted to add a little substance to an otherwise, run of the mill R-rated comedy, but decided to throw in everything they could think of instead of sticking it out and making that one comedy as strong as it could possibly be.The cast is pretty decent. The chemistry between Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis is what's front and center the entire film. Watching their confidence slowly crumble as they realize picking up women isn't as easy as they remember is one of the key elements to the humor in the film. Christina Applegate is just as funny and is used just as much in Hall Pass that she was in Anchorman while The Office's Jenna Fischer doesn't seem to stray too far away from her Pam Beesly character. Steven Merchant's Gary is used sparingly in the film, but he has some pretty hilarious scenes that steal the show more often than not. His extra scene during the credits of the film is easily one of the highlights. It has all of the outrageous antics that just transpired in the film and then some condensed into about two minutes. The sad part is Gary's fantasy may have made a better movie. Richard Jenkins is probably the highlight of the cast though. He was such a straight shooter, businessman type in Step Brothers and assisted a vampire to feed in Let Me In. To see him go from characters like that to Coakley, a sex-hound who can get any woman he wants, is kind of incredible.Hall Pass is more than a little disappointing overall. Its vulgar and outrageous humor will win over most who go to see it and, to be fair, it is funnier than expected. However, the film seems to try too hard to get laughs and insists on pushing the envelope far beyond its limits. Meanwhile, the rather action packed finale feels out of place and the last thing Rick says to Maggie makes the entire ""hall pass"" concept a waste of time. All in all, Hall Pass isn't completely terrible but it comes up short in actually being worthwhile.",2,A comedy that tries a little too hard,1298592000,"02 25, 2011",2011,4033,"['Farrelly', 'brothers', 'hit', 'high', 'point', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'kind', 'sad', 'was', 'debut', 'filmmakers', ""'ve"", 'been', 'downward', 'spiral', 'ever', 'Something', 'Mary', 'was', 'probably', 'more', 'popular', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'buzz', 'surrounding', 'Me', 'Myself', 'Irene', 'everything', 'else', 'Farrelly', 'brothers', 'have', 'done', 'have', 'fallen', 'radar', 'everyone', 'forgotten', 'good', 'reason', 'i.e', 'Shallow', 'Hal', 'So', 'along', 'Hall', 'Pass', 'first', 'Farrelly', 'brothers', 'feature', 'film', 'four', 'years', 'trailers', 'TV', 'spots', 'did', 'seem', 'give', 'impression', 'film', 'would', 'least', 'be', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'film', 'out', 'be', 'funnier', 'may', 'expect', 'Hall', 'Pass', 'come', 'up', 'little', 'short', 'execution.As', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'Hall', 'Pass', 'pretty', 'top', 'raunchy', 'times', 'Farrelly', 'brothers', 'have', 'become', 'notorious', 'type', 'humor', 'So', 'getting', 'high', 'pot', 'brownies', 'defecating', 'golf', 'course', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'fake', 'chow', ""n't"", 'sound', 'good', 'time', 'then', 'Hall', 'Pass', 'probably', ""n't"", 'type', 'movie', 'want', 'see', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'walking', 'out', 'time', 'Rick', 'up', 'jacuzzi', 'Leigh', 'gym', 'once', 'realize', 'what', 'Knight', 'Rider', 'refers', 'film', 'also', 'felt', 'was', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'get', 'majority', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'big', 'elaborate', 'scene', 'where', 'Rick', 'Fred', 'would', 'try', 'get', 'laid', 'would', 'backfire', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'found', 'laughing', 'way', 'certain', 'lines', 'were', 'said', 'film', 'facial', 'expressions', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'finale', 'film', 'also', 'really', 'anticlimactic', 'Events', 'film', 'escalate', 'ridiculousness', 'film', 'Hangover', 'made', 'something', 'work', 'least', 'had', 'naked', 'Korean', 'guy', 'trunk', 'waiting', 'hit', 'head', 'crowbar', 'make', 'rest', 'film', 'fairly', 'unpredictable', 'Hall', 'Pass', 'cram', 'action', 'drama', 'sex', 'car', 'chase', 'heartfelt', 'speech', 'conclusion', 'was', 'Farrelly', 'brothers', 'wanted', 'add', 'little', 'substance', 'otherwise', 'run', 'mill', 'R-rated', 'comedy', 'decided', 'throw', 'everything', 'could', 'think', 'instead', 'sticking', 'making', 'one', 'comedy', 'as', 'strong', 'could', 'possibly', 'be.The', 'cast', 'pretty', 'decent', 'chemistry', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Jason', 'Sudeikis', 'what', 'front', 'center', 'entire', 'film', 'Watching', 'confidence', 'slowly', 'crumble', 'realize', 'picking', 'up', 'women', ""n't"", 'as', 'easy', 'remember', 'one', 'key', 'elements', 'humor', 'film', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'just', 'funny', 'used', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Hall', 'Pass', 'was', 'Anchorman', 'Office', 'Jenna', 'Fischer', ""n't"", 'seem', 'stray', 'too', 'far', 'away', 'Pam', 'Beesly', 'character', 'Steven', 'Merchant', 'Gary', 'used', 'sparingly', 'film', 'pretty', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'steal', 'show', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'extra', 'scene', 'credits', 'film', 'easily', 'one', 'highlights', 'outrageous', 'antics', 'just', 'transpired', 'film', 'then', 'condensed', 'about', 'two', 'minutes', 'sad', 'part', 'Gary', 'fantasy', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'movie', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'probably', 'highlight', 'cast', 'was', 'such', 'straight', 'shooter', 'businessman', 'type', 'Step', 'Brothers', 'assisted', 'vampire', 'feed', 'Let', 'Me', 'see', 'go', 'characters', 'Coakley', 'sex-hound', 'who', 'can', 'get', 'woman', 'kind', 'incredible.Hall', 'Pass', 'more', 'little', 'disappointing', 'overall', 'vulgar', 'outrageous', 'humor', 'will', 'win', 'most', 'who', 'go', 'see', 'be', 'fair', 'funnier', 'expected', 'However', 'film', 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'get', 'laughs', 'insists', 'pushing', 'envelope', 'far', 'limits', 'Meanwhile', 'rather', 'action', 'packed', 'finale', 'feels', 'place', 'last', 'thing', 'Rick', 'Maggie', 'entire', 'hall', 'pass', 'concept', 'waste', 'time', 'Hall', 'Pass', ""n't"", 'completely', 'terrible', 'up', 'short', 'actually', 'being', 'worthwhile']",N/A

1400519,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B004EPYZS0,DanD,"[2, 3]","Some comedies sneak up on you.  You think they're going to be brilliant and then they fall flat, or you think they're going to be stale and vulgar and end up being delightfully complex.  The latter is the case with HALL PASS.  It's a relatively simple premise: two middle-aged men get ""hall passes"" from their wives, which means they get to spend a week being single.  Predictable shenanigans ensue: horrendous pick-up attempts; gross-out gags; dick jokes; drug and booze binges; a redemptive finale.And yet, HALL PASS manages to carve something original.  Not only do Rick and Fred get a week off, but so do their wives--and therein lies much of the depth of the film.  Granted, we're not talking a masterpiece here--it's the Farrelly Brothers for crying out loud, and note the absence of two stars in this review.  HALL PASS isn't transcendental of its buddy-raunchy film genre; it falls victim to the same flaws, the same generic traps.  Yet, there is something in this film that makes it better than much of its ilk.  Putting your thumb on exactly WHAT that saving grace is can be tricky, though.The casting is definitely a plus.  Owen Wilson is in good form--he can hit or miss, and here he mostly hits.  So to does Jason Sudeikis, despite some rather flat writing for his character.  The casting of their wives is truly inspired: the pairing of comedy veterans Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate is utterly delightful, and provides an emotional depth that would otherwise be missing (she's typecast, but darn if Applegate doesn't have great dramatic chops as well).

If you haven't found anything in the plethora of channels to hold your attention, chances are slim you won't hit paydirt methodically moving the channel changer up and down.  So imagine my pleasurable surprise when I came across HALL PASS, a Farrelly brothers comedy that looked so lame during its theatrical run it gave me zero desire to see it; yet the moment I dialed it up on the remote and began to witness the trademark Farrelly sophomoric humor--along with a surprisingly engaging and clever dialogue--I was hooked for the long haul.  HALL PASS is as hysterically funny as it is unabashedly over the top; the story of two horny and bored husbands getting a week long ""hall pass"" from their exasperated wives scores intense comedic bliss.  And naturally, irony of ironies, while the guys' efforts to score end in one disaster after another, the wives almost fall into extramarital adventures.Owen Wilson (sporting a ridiculous haircut) and Jason Sudeikis play the husbands with wandering eyes; in denial they are well past their prime as ""babe magnets"", they embark on a booty quest that had me donkey braying, time and time again.  Meanwhile the beleaguered wives, played by Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate, suddenly find themselves having to hold at arms' length the amorous intentions of a summer league coach and one of his players.  The guys' capers are fruitless, often with dire consequences, culminating in a seduction scene whereby Wilson's character shows his true qualities by turning down the affections of a stunning bombshell (Nicky Whelan).  Imagine my surprise when treated to a tender and thoughtful ending--but stay tuned through the closing credits, as the Farrelly boys have some more zingers coming your way.

It was a frivolous but mildly amusing story of a couple bored married men longing for the party, party, party days of their younger single life. Somehow, I felt as if I'd heard that story line before. Yaawwwnnnn! I might add that the parties they longed for seemed as boring as the basic plot of this movie. After a few routine marriage-type clashes with their wives, it was proposed that they be allowed to be free from marriage for a week break, what was called a ""Hall Pass."" It was proposed by the wives and, of course the husbands leaped at the opportunity to be free and unmarried, at least for a week.The movie chronicles the events of the Hall Pass week and it bored me to watch it unfold in a predictable fashion. I might add, that I was single for over five decades and know the single life well. It's not as glamorous and fun-filled as Hollywood depicts. I think memories are filled with the pleasant times and the less-pleasant events fade away. Anyway, night after night of the Hall Pass week went buy with the main result of them getting tired and longing for home and family. Some of the incidents depicted are amusing to watch, but most of them are just embarrassing. Is that good comedy? Being embarrassed by what you're viewing? Well, I guess that's some people's idea. This movie was so cliche-ridden and predictable that I began to long for the ending. Meanwhile, the wives also had a marriage-free week, something the husbands had devoted little thought to, and they fared somewhat better. All in all, the movie was tiresome, albeit with amusing parts here and there, and I guess that's the kind of movie that fits the end of a long busy day.Gary Peterson",2,Tiresome And Predictable.

It seems like the whole plot was meant to make you buy things companies spent a lot of money to advertise and the writers didn't give two craps about covering that up.  There is a scene where the guys talk about how awesome Applebee's is and make it seem like a great place to hang out and be cool.  Then they throw in a reference about how you'll get laid by all the hot chicks at Chilli's.All of this is repeated several times throughout the movie.  Frankly product placement isn't all that unusual these days so I suppose otherwise you wouldn't notice it but the plot and acting is horrible.  The actors dont seem to give a damn about trying hard and again the writers didn't give them much to strive for.

Part of it was the cast, which was excellent for this kind of comedic material - Owen Wilson married to Jenna Fischer (of The Office) and Jason Sudeikis married to Christina Applegate. The basic premise is that the Jenna and Christina characters give their husbands a week off from marriage. They try to get laid (sort of), while the women discover it may be them that needed the break. The best demographic for this film is definitely the 30/40-something-with-kids-and-a-minivan crowd.It's a Farrelly brother movie, so there is plenty of gross-out humor, but I thought it was actually funny, as opposed to most gross-out humor which completely misses the mark. I grimaced at a particularly gross scene involving a nicotine-addicted flake picked up by Jason Sudeikis's character, but I also laughed, and at the very least it was not a scene I had seen before.I think much of the credit for the movie working goes to Owen Wilson, who is at his soulful, quirky best here, although all four leads were great.

1400563,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B004EPYZS0,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[6, 9]","The Farrelly Brothers' new comedy, Hall Pass, is about grown men having trouble moving on and is made, without irony, by a pair of grown film-makers who also seem to be having trouble moving on.In that way it resonated sharply with me: the ""roaring forties"" are a difficult time when unwelcome facts of life (viz., the weighty hunch that best bits of it have been and gone) become harder to disregard. A popular gambit is denial: we believe we've still got the mojo, if only we were allowed to let it out. Hall Pass's premise is a somewhat implausible calling of that particular bluff: alright boys: get it out of your system: you have a week to show you're still, er, cock of the walk. Cue the riotous fun which ensues, right?You guessed it.The film is about as diverting, and about as challenging, as you'd expect for a films of this sub-genre. Praise, I suppose, but faint enough to look like damnation. Then again, I don't usually go for frat-house comedies. I have no idea who does, really: but Hollywood keeps making them, so there must be some sort of natural constituency. (I can't believe it's purely the ""John Major"" middle ground of people at the video store who can't agree on anything better).It is a difficult film because, in an oil and water moment, the Farellies have tried to meld frat-house and romantic comedies (by way, perhaps, of trying to prove they're growing up). If they get away with it, it is because Owen Wilson plays a likeable dad so well, but - again - faint praise.Wilson's Rick has a mildly wandering eye of the sort possessed by all males of all ages, and no more: he would never dream of acting on it. In a funny, if contrived, set piece he is observed riffing on this with his buddy Fred (Jason Sudeikis) in excruciating fashion on CCTV in front of some po-faced friends. Rick's wife Maggie (Jenna Fischer) concludes, somewhat neurotically, that her marriage is on shaky grounds (patently, it isn't) and that a swift corrective is needed. Fully implausible, but it's a frat-com, so forgive it that. Upshot: Rick and Fred are granted the freedom from their marital vows for a week to get it out of their system (on the supposition they'll be fully incapable of doing anything of the sort).Thus we swiftly move into a predictable middle act: they guys and their frat buddies congregate enthusiastically and, as fore-saged, talk biiiiig but take no action, hang out at steak houses, chug beer and play golf under the influence of Stephen Merchant's hash cookies (Merchant, as always, is funny: the golf scene otherwise isn't). From here, for the boys, it all goes down hill.The girls, on the other hand, repair to Cape Cod with the kids and hook up with a minor-league baseball team and have dazzling flirtatious fun-in-the-sun. From there, for the girls, it gets ever more complicated. Like you didn't see that coming.All this is so much hot air, and would be wholly unremarkable without sparkling characters or outrageous visual gags and comedic set pieces to provide punctuation. Of the former (outside Nicky Whelan's Aussie barista babe, Leigh) there are few; of the latter, as you'd expect from the Farrelly brothers, there are plenty, one or two of the quality of those inThere's Something About Mary(Wilson's rescue from a spa bath by two nude men being one, the unfortunate plight of a girl with an upset tummy, in a thong, who ""never vomits"" being another).There are also some spectacular scatalogical mishits (if you'll excuse the visual pun): seeing a fat man taking a dump in a bunker on a golf course just lowers the tone: there wasn't even a golfing pun to leaven it.It's an engaging enough film, I enjoyed it, certainly - but in targeting, as it does, incompatible audiences (those who like frat-coms and those who like rom-coms tend to be mutually exclusive) it runs a large danger of slipping without trace into the chasm between themOlly Buxton",3,Hospital Pass,1299456000,"03 7, 2011",2011,3897,"['Farrelly', 'Brothers', 'new', 'comedy', 'Hall', 'Pass', 'grown', 'men', 'having', 'trouble', 'moving', 'made', 'irony', 'pair', 'grown', 'film-makers', 'who', 'also', 'seem', 'be', 'having', 'trouble', 'moving', 'on.In', 'way', 'resonated', 'sharply', 'roaring', 'forties', 'are', 'difficult', 'time', 'when', 'unwelcome', 'facts', 'life', 'viz.', 'weighty', 'hunch', 'best', 'bits', 'have', 'been', 'gone', 'become', 'harder', 'disregard', 'popular', 'gambit', 'denial', 'believe', ""'ve"", 'still', 'got', 'mojo', 'only', 'were', 'allowed', 'let', 'out', 'Hall', 'Pass', 'premise', 'somewhat', 'implausible', 'calling', 'particular', 'bluff', 'alright', 'boys', 'get', 'system', 'have', 'week', 'show', ""'re"", 'still', 'er', 'cock', 'walk', 'Cue', 'riotous', 'fun', 'right', 'guessed', 'it.The', 'film', 'diverting', 'challenging', ""'d"", 'expect', 'films', 'sub-genre', 'Praise', 'suppose', 'faint', 'enough', 'look', 'damnation', 'Then', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'go', 'frat-house', 'comedies', 'have', 'idea', 'who', 'really', 'Hollywood', 'keeps', 'making', 'so', 'must', 'be', 'sort', 'natural', 'constituency', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'purely', 'John', 'Major', 'middle', 'ground', 'people', 'video', 'store', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'agree', 'anything', 'better', '.It', 'difficult', 'film', 'oil', 'water', 'moment', 'Farellies', 'have', 'tried', 'meld', 'frat-house', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'way', 'perhaps', 'trying', 'prove', ""'re"", 'growing', 'up', 'get', 'away', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'likeable', 'dad', 'so', 'well', 'again', 'faint', 'praise.Wilson', 'Rick', 'mildly', 'wandering', 'eye', 'sort', 'possessed', 'males', 'ages', 'more', 'would', 'never', 'dream', 'acting', 'funny', 'contrived', 'set', 'piece', 'observed', 'riffing', 'buddy', 'Fred', 'Jason', 'Sudeikis', 'excruciating', 'fashion', 'CCTV', 'front', 'po-faced', 'friends', 'Rick', 'wife', 'Maggie', 'Jenna', 'Fischer', 'somewhat', 'neurotically', 'marriage', 'shaky', 'grounds', 'patently', ""n't"", 'swift', 'corrective', 'needed', 'Fully', 'implausible', 'frat-com', 'so', 'forgive', 'Upshot', 'Rick', 'Fred', 'are', 'granted', 'freedom', 'marital', 'vows', 'week', 'get', 'system', 'supposition', ""'ll"", 'be', 'fully', 'incapable', 'doing', 'anything', 'sort', '.Thus', 'swiftly', 'move', 'predictable', 'middle', 'act', 'guys', 'frat', 'buddies', 'congregate', 'enthusiastically', 'fore-saged', 'talk', 'biiiiig', 'take', 'action', 'hang', 'out', 'steak', 'houses', 'chug', 'beer', 'play', 'golf', 'influence', 'Stephen', 'Merchant', 'hash', 'cookies', 'Merchant', 'always', 'funny', 'golf', 'scene', 'otherwise', ""n't"", 'here', 'boys', 'down', 'hill.The', 'girls', 'other', 'hand', 'repair', 'Cape', 'Cod', 'kids', 'hook', 'up', 'minor-league', 'baseball', 'team', 'have', 'dazzling', 'flirtatious', 'fun-in-the-sun', 'there', 'girls', 'ever', 'more', 'complicated', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming.All', 'so', 'much', 'hot', 'air', 'would', 'be', 'wholly', 'unremarkable', 'sparkling', 'characters', 'outrageous', 'visual', 'gags', 'comedic', 'set', 'pieces', 'provide', 'punctuation', 'former', 'outside', 'Nicky', 'Whelan', 'Aussie', 'barista', 'babe', 'Leigh', 'are', 'few', 'latter', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Farrelly', 'brothers', 'are', 'plenty', 'one', 'two', 'quality', 'Something', 'Mary', 'Wilson', 'rescue', 'spa', 'bath', 'two', 'nude', 'men', 'being', 'one', 'unfortunate', 'plight', 'girl', 'upset', 'tummy', 'thong', 'who', 'never', 'vomits', 'being', 'are', 'also', 'spectacular', 'scatalogical', 'mishits', ""'ll"", 'excuse', 'visual', 'pun', 'seeing', 'fat', 'man', 'taking', 'dump', 'bunker', 'golf', 'course', 'just', 'tone', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'golfing', 'pun', 'leaven', 'it.It', 'engaging', 'enough', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'certainly', 'targeting', 'incompatible', 'audiences', 'who', 'frat-coms', 'who', 'rom-coms', 'tend', 'be', 'mutually', 'exclusive', 'large', 'danger', 'slipping', 'trace', 'chasm', 'themOlly', 'Buxton']",N/A

1400580,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B004EPYZS0,Steve,"[9, 14]","There are lots of movies touting stupid acting guys (and an increasing number of gals - way to fight for those equal rights, ladies!), overflowing with bodily fluids, sophomoric sexual one-liners, random acts of nudity, and usually some kind of mind alteration. These movies used to just be scenes strung together via dumb jokes, but thanks to The Hangover and its inexplicable Oscar nomination, now they try to pass off as farce. A farce needs clever writing and insightful satire to work well. However, the writing has become so awful and lacking in creativity that no matter how much I prepare myself for movies like this; they always let me down because they end up far more stupid than funny, and far dumber and juvenile than I anticipate. How low should expectations be?The latest movie in this growing genre is Hall Pass, a movie I proudly lump with Step Brothers as: Worst I Have Ever Seen.  Once again, two suburban 30-40something guys find themselves in bizarre situations thanks to their complete lack of common sense and intelligence. The dopes, thanks to their 14 year old sexual maturity (obvious gawking at passing women and personal gratification in the car outside the home),  get a week away from their more-attractive-than-would-make-sense wives to get it out of their system. Let the madness begin. I've seen episodes of Gilligan's Island that worked better than Hall Pass.What bugs me about this movie and Hollywood entertainment as a whole, is how often guys are portrayed as sex-obsessed, parentally challenged, clueless, spineless, geeky, immature morons. Yet, in every case, they are married to superior-in-every-way women who for unknown reasons tolerate these idiots. What does this say about how we view gender roles? Is this the concept of marriage that our society reflects, as seen in the mirror of Hollywood?Highly recommended...that you do anything but watch this movie.",1,Dumb and Dumber,1324252800,"12 19, 2011",2011,1903,"['are', 'lots', 'movies', 'touting', 'stupid', 'acting', 'guys', 'increasing', 'number', 'gals', 'way', 'fight', 'equal', 'rights', 'ladies', 'overflowing', 'bodily', 'fluids', 'sophomoric', 'sexual', 'one-liners', 'random', 'acts', 'nudity', 'usually', 'kind', 'mind', 'alteration', 'movies', 'used', 'just', 'be', 'scenes', 'strung', 'together', 'dumb', 'jokes', 'thanks', 'Hangover', 'inexplicable', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'now', 'try', 'pass', 'off', 'farce', 'farce', 'clever', 'writing', 'insightful', 'satire', 'work', 'well', 'However', 'writing', 'become', 'so', 'awful', 'lacking', 'creativity', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'prepare', 'movies', 'always', 'let', 'down', 'end', 'up', 'far', 'more', 'stupid', 'funny', 'far', 'dumber', 'juvenile', 'anticipate', 'How', 'low', 'should', 'expectations', 'be', 'latest', 'movie', 'growing', 'genre', 'Hall', 'Pass', 'movie', 'proudly', 'lump', 'Step', 'Brothers', 'Worst', 'Have', 'Ever', 'Seen', 'Once', 'again', 'two', 'suburban', '30-40something', 'guys', 'find', 'bizarre', 'situations', 'thanks', 'complete', 'lack', 'common', 'sense', 'intelligence', 'dopes', 'thanks', '14', 'year', 'old', 'sexual', 'maturity', 'obvious', 'gawking', 'passing', 'women', 'personal', 'gratification', 'car', 'home', 'get', 'week', 'away', 'more-attractive-than-would-make-sense', 'wives', 'get', 'system', 'Let', 'madness', 'begin', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'episodes', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'worked', 'better', 'Hall', 'Pass.What', 'bugs', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'entertainment', 'whole', 'how', 'often', 'guys', 'are', 'portrayed', 'sex-obsessed', 'parentally', 'challenged', 'clueless', 'spineless', 'geeky', 'immature', 'morons', 'case', 'are', 'married', 'superior-in-every-way', 'women', 'who', 'unknown', 'reasons', 'tolerate', 'idiots', 'What', 'say', 'how', 'view', 'gender', 'roles', 'concept', 'marriage', 'society', 'seen', 'mirror', 'Hollywood', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'do', 'anything', 'watch', 'movie']",N/A

1400583,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B004EPYZS0,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[6, 13]","Remember when the Farrelly Brothers made funny films? Remember ""There's Something About Mary""? Their new film ""Hall Pass"" desperately wants you to remember this connection. ""Mary"" seems to be the watershed moment in the Brothers' career and raised our expectations too high, I guess they hope we will be fooled into believing ""Hall Pass"" is as good... Is any good...The new film is funny, at times, and contains the required necessary Farrelly gross out gags (which are also funny), but you expect more from the Brothers; many, many jokes don't work, the film stars Owen Wilson who is spectacularly miscast and the film looks like it was made at an old shopping mall. The film is a wash, a mess and a trial to sit through..Rick (Wilson), a realtor, is married to Maggie (Jenna Fischer, TV's ""The Office"") and is best friends with Fred (Jason Sudeikis, ""Saturday Night Live""), an insurance salesman, who is married to Grace (Christina Applegate). Both men are adults who act as mature as the horny teenagers they wish they still were. Rick watches an attractive young woman walk by while he is with his wife, upsetting her. The two women talk with their friend, Dr. Lucy (Joy Behar, WTF?) who mentions that she gave her husband a 'hall pass' many years ago. He didn't use it, but the idea of it reinvigorated their marriage.  After much discussion, Maggie and Grace decide to give it a try. Rick and Fred are ecstatic and their circle of buddies, Gary (Stephen Merchant, Ricky Gervais' producing partner), Hog-Head (Larry Joe Campbell) and Flats (J. B. Smoove) want ringside seats for the week of debauchery.There are a few laughs in ""Hall Pass"", but these seem few and very far between. When you are sitting in a theater, watching a comedy, and you sit for long periods of time without laughing, what happens? The film seems very long. Worse, when you do find yourself laughing at the silly, stupid humor and the gross out gags, you remember back to ""There's Something About Mary"". These filmmakers once made a film that was so funny I had to watch it again to catch all of the jokes I missed the first time. ""Hall Pass"" doesn't suffer the same fate. What happened between the two films? Did they forget how to make us laugh?When we first meet Rick and Fred, there seem to be a lot of opportunities for laughs. But these opportunities seem to evaporate in thin air. I think a lot of the problem arises from the casting, Owen Wilson is miscast. Rick is supposed to be the moral center of the film. Yes, he jumps at the chance to use his hall pass, but he also seems the most conflicted about it. Wilson usually plays the schemer, the mover and shaker, the liar and this provides him with something to so, no matter how annoying it may be. In ""Hall Pass"", he doesn't have this and it makes him seem boring. He can't do anything with the character to make him seem interesting and worth watching. He simply whines through most of the film.I haven't really liked a lot of Owen Wilson's work in the past few years, have I? Yet, I keep going to his films. He seems to continue getting work with filmmakers I admire or hope to enjoy, yet he is often the worst thing about the film. In ""Hall Pass"", he isn't the worst thing, but he doesn't add enough to redeem it either.Jason Sudeikis plays Fred who, unlike Rick, doesn't seem to have a moral compass. Or at least he doesn't seem to care as much about cheating on his wife. And he relishes the outlandish things Rick does. And these antics provide most of the laughs in the film.Jenna Fischer and Cristina Applegate play the wives. I'm not sure if these roles are supposed to be completely humorless, but they are. The two women realize that if there husbands get a hall pass, they should get the same. So they head to the shore. There, they meet two guys who start to pour on the charm. The husbands are cheating, why can't they?There are two or three gross out gags providing the most memorable moments in the entire film. But that's a bit of a double-edged sword. I'm thankful the gags are there, but it is disappointing they are the best and most memorable bits of the film. In a better film, they would only be an accent. But that would be in a better film.A lot of the little story lines and some of the characters seem to go nowehere. Rick is attracted to a beautiful, younger Australian woman who works at the coffee shop he frequents. Her co-worker, a nerdy guy who looks like he would be at home at an open mike poetry night, takes offense and an instant dislike to Rick. He sees him oogling his co-worker. Every time Rick comes in, the male barista tries to stand in his way. Again, an amusing idea but it doesn't go anywhere. The filmmakers are only interested in getting Rick and the young woman together. And this seems to take forever.The Greek Chorus surrounding Rick and Fred are a mixed bag, It is an amusing concept; three nerdy, equally childish men trying to live vicariously through their 'heroes'. But nothing really develops and they disappear for at least half of the film. Stephen Merchant is the most memorable and has a funny moment during the credits. Honestly, if the entire film were of the same quality as these last few moments, we would have another ""There's Something About Mary"".Richard Jenkins plays Coakler, a man both men revere for his skills with the women. Fred and Rick refer to him many times throughout, their circle of friends also seem to revere him. But when he makes an appearance, very late in the story, he is completely forgettable. It wasn't worth waiting for him and the anticipation only serves to highlight how disappointing this usually very talented actor's participation is.Joy Behar pops up as a published author. I guess she is supposed to be modeled on Dr. Laura, and friend of Maggie and Grace, Why Joy Behar is in this film is beyond me, way beyond me, a space galaxy beyond me. She isn't funny and doesn't seen as though she is supposed to.Perhaps the most perplexing thing is how cheap the film looks. It seems like the entire film was shot in a shopping mall because every scene seems lit incorrectly, it appears harsh, fake and the light washes out all detail giving everything a flat look. I don't normally comment on such things unless it is really noticeable or really bad. In ""Hall Pass"" it is both.""Hall Pass"" is a big misfire. The few jokes don't make up for the interminable amount of time spent waiting for them to happen. The Farrelly Brothers' next film is ""The Three Stooges"". Originally, Jim Carrey and Sean Penn were going to star. That would be interesting. But both dropped out. Now Andy Samburg is the big headliner. Should we take a cue from Carrey and Penn and get a ""Hall Pass"" for the Farrelly Brothers' next film?",2,The Laughs Are Few and Far Between,1301011200,"03 25, 2011",2011,6745,"['Remember', 'when',

What starts off as a blessing soon becomes more then they can handle.  I was not sure what to fully expect from this movie. I expected funny but I was ready for dissapointment.  I was wrong.  This is a laugh-out-loud movie from start to finish.  Very raunchy in parts, but it is a Farrelly Brothers movie so that is expected.  The casting is great and Wilson and Sudeikis do a great job of playing off each other.  I do have to say that Richard Jenkins (not really known for comedic roles) is the perfect choice for his part and almost steals the movie from everyone.  This is the funniest comedy to be released in a long time.  While it does have a few serious moments it is more consistently funny the ""The Dilemma"" and even more so then ""Just Go With It"".

He/She said that I panned every movie in every review I ever made, which was a flat out lie because I've given glowing reviews to 'Robocop' and my favorite album of all time:  Slayer's 'Reign In Blood'.I went to the video store the other day for the first time in fourteen months and browsed over the titles.  I've worked with Peter before, so I grabbed this one because I like him, the movies are always good for a few laughs and if I'm actually stepping foot in that place I have to leave with something.I can honestly say that this was the funniest movie I've seen in a decade.  I don't quite understand the myriad of negative reviews where the majority are questioning how old someone has to be to find this amusing.  I simply say you have to have some degree of personality and then you have to understand that this is actual adult situational comedy (and not the Jerry Lewis kind).  What I find brilliant about this particular adult situational comedy is that there's about 95% truth in every aspect of it and it never seems to me that the movie is trying too hard to be over-the-top (and there are many 'over-the-top' scenarios, here).I'd give this 4.5 Stars if I could.  The only negative I'll give it is that no movie is worth 5 Stars (unless it rhymes with Schmotocop) and there's about a 10-15 minute window where there's a van destruction scene that's relatively needless/pointless.I don't think The Farrelly Brothers are trying to trick you into thinking you're watching Dr Zhivago, here.  This is a comedy with a lot of anatomical and crass humor...and it's VERY funny.  It's also very truthful.  Guys like looking at girls regardless of how many years they've been married or how in love they are with their significant other and women are dirty, cheating dogs (for the most part).",4,I Won't Accept The Negativity,1327190400,"01 22, 2012",2012,1911,"['have', 'prelude', 'review', 'saying', 'one', 'time', 'Internet', 'tough', 'guy/girl', 'called', 'jerk', 'forum', 'He/She', 'said', 'panned', 'movie', 'review', 'ever', 'made', 'was', 'flat', 'out', 'lie', ""'ve"", 'given', 'glowing', 'reviews', ""'Robocop"", 'favorite', 'album', 'time', 'Slayer', ""'Reign"", ""Blood'.I"", 'went', 'video', 'store', 'other', 'day', 'first', 'time', 'fourteen', 'months', 'browsed', 'titles', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'Peter', 'grabbed', 'one', 'like', 'movies', 'are', 'always', 'good', 'few', 'laughs', ""'m"", 'actually', 'stepping', 'foot', 'place', 'have', 'leave', 'something.I', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'was', 'funniest', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'decade', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'myriad', 'negative', 'reviews', 'where', 'majority', 'are', 'questioning', 'how', 'old', 'someone', 'be', 'find', 'amusing', 'simply', 'say', 'have', 'have', 'degree', 'personality', 'then', 'have', 'understand', 'actual', 'adult', 'situational', 'comedy', 'not', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'kind', 'What', 'find', 'brilliant', 'particular', 'adult', 'situational', 'comedy', '95', '%', 'truth', 'aspect', 'never', 'movie', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'over-the-top', 'are', 'many', ""'over-the-top"", 'scenarios', 'here', '.I', ""'d"", 'give', '4.5', 'Stars', 'could', 'only', 'negative', ""'ll"", 'give', 'movie', 'worth', '5', 'Stars', 'Schmotocop', '10-15', 'minute', 'window', 'where', 'van', 'destruction', 'scene', 'relatively', 'needless/pointless.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Farrelly', 'Brothers', 'are', 'trying', 'trick', 'thinking', ""'re"", 'watching', 'Dr', 'Zhivago', 'here', 'comedy', 'lot', 'anatomical', 'crass', 'humor', 'VERY', 'funny', 'also', 'very', 'truthful', 'Guys', 'looking', 'girls', 'regardless', 'how', 'many', 'years', ""'ve"", 'been', 'married', 'how', 'love', 'are', 'significant', 'other', 'women', 'are', 'dirty', 'cheating', 'dogs', 'most', 'part']",N/A

It seemed like they were trying hard to go the Hangover route, but also trying to make it into a good-hearted comedy. Similar to the 40 year old virgin. which is probably why the two main guys were such geeks. I didn't find myself caring much about them and their situations.I don't mind the raunchy crude comedy, but if you are going to go that route. You need to go all the way and be over the top. The whole thing seemed too scripted and didn't really flow.Also, this movie should not be an hour and forty five minutes long. They need to have a director's cut and throw out about 20-30 minutes. I actually stopped it at an hour and thirty minutes.I should have stopped it a lot sooner.Although I didn't know what happened at the end and wasted all that time watching up to that point.

The scene that they found most hilarious was the blast of poop on the wall...  That couldn't even get a chuckle out of me, compared to a couple of other juvenile jokes that did.
