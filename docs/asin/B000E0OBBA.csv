We picked it up and watched it and my first reaction was this is a crappy horror film, but man what an awesome action/drama!  After I saw the movie I reread the article in Fangoria and the author conceded that this movie was not a horror film (this totally slipped by me when I read it the first time), but was a film worthy of viewing by anyone who liked good films.  The author is right.  Dean Cain, usually associated with the Lois and Clark series, is better known to me through the horror films he's done like Boa and Dragon Fighter, and him hosting the Ripley's Believe It or Not series.  I'm not a big fan of his work, but always thought he was a descent enough actor.  He's excellent in this film.  There is not one point that I didn't believe him as this character.  He does an absolutely incredible job of making us believe him.  The supporting cast is brilliant with Danny Trejo as the menace on the road and Ashley Scott comes off as the perfect 'voice on the phone' that's easy to listen too and easy to believe.  The story is well thought out and it's an absolute blast to watch a bad situation goes from bad, to worse, and finally totally disintegrates right in front of him.  I'm not familiar with anything that Darren Lemke's done in the past, but if this is any indication of what is coming in the future, then I'm in for the ride of my life.",5,"By All Means, Buckle Up And Get LOST!!",1159833600,"10 3, 2006",2006,1481,"['originally', 'read', 'movie', 'issue', 'Fangoria', 'magazine', 'led', 'believe', 'was', 'horror', 'film', 'picked', 'up', 'watched', 'first', 'reaction', 'was', 'crappy', 'horror', 'film', 'man', 'what', 'awesome', 'action/drama', 'saw', 'movie', 'reread', 'article', 'Fangoria', 'author', 'conceded', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'horror', 'film', 'totally', 'slipped', 'when', 'read', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'film', 'worthy', 'viewing', 'anyone', 'who', 'liked', 'good', 'films', 'author', 'right', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'usually', 'associated', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'series', 'better', 'known', 'horror', 'done', 'Boa', 'Dragon', 'Fighter', 'hosting', 'Ripley', 'Believe', 'Not', 'series', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'work', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'descent', 'enough', 'actor', 'excellent', 'film', 'not', 'one', 'point', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'character', 'absolutely', 'incredible', 'job', 'making', 'believe', 'supporting', 'cast', 'brilliant', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'menace', 'road', 'Ashley', 'Scott', 'off', 'perfect', ""'voice"", 'phone', 'easy', 'listen', 'too', 'easy', 'believe', 'story', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'absolute', 'blast', 'watch', 'bad', 'situation', 'bad', 'worse', 'finally', 'totally', 'right', 'front', ""'m"", 'not', 'familiar', 'anything', 'Darren', 'Lemke', 'done', 'past', 'indication', 'what', 'coming', 'future', 'then', ""'m"", 'ride', 'life']",Lost

While Cain has had some good roles in movies like MAN ON FIRE and BEST MEN, nothing has challenged him as much as this role.  He plays Jeremy, a young executive who has just pulled off a major heist (6 million), and finds himself lost somewhere in Nevada, being followed by the robbers he betrayed and his only ally a voice from the Road Map customer service department.  Cain pretty much has a solo act in this unusual thriller, well written and directed.  He displays a range of emotion he has rarely had to call on before, and he pulls through with a stunning performance.

964177,A9MOZDD4DO6FY,B000E0OBBA,"Robert M. Penna ""Dr. Bob""","[2, 9]","Considering his string of career disappointments since the demise of ""Lois & Clark"" you have to wonder why in the world Dean Cain would ever have agreed to star in ""Lost,"" a 2004 movie by Darren Lemke now available on DVD.  The only possible answer that comes to mind is that Cain figured that if people could suspend their disbelieve enough to not see through Clark Kent's disguise, then maybe they could also suspend it enough not see through this failed and pointless movie.The set-up here (one can't actually call it a plot) is that Cain is a bank VP who arranges to have his own bank robbed, and then double-crosses the bad guys who stage the hold-up on his behalf.  It is a premise that might have gone far in the hands of an accomplished screenwriter.  Unfortunately, Lemke acted as his own scribe and apparently never showed the script to a soul until the cameras started rolling, so one can only surmise that there was no one else there to tell him that he had gone way, way, way, off course.The tension in the film is supposed to come from three facts: #1, Cain's character, Jeremy Stanton, is lost somewhere in the Nevada desert trying to make his escape from what he initially believes to be the perfect crime.  The second alleged tension point is the fact that not only his erstwhile accomplices, but everyone else west of the Mississippi have quickly figured out that Stanton is the brains behind both the robbery and the double-cross.  The third and final bit of suspense is intended to come from the fact that Stanton's cheated former partners are hot on his trail.Regrettably, not one of these subplots really works.  Much is made in the screenplay of the fact that Stanton's map is out of date and that roads along his intended route are closed, flooded or no longer in existence.  But by the third time his On-Star proxy telephone navigation aide has informed him that the road he is on actually has a different name than the one on the map, the device has worn dangerously thin.  In point of fact, it is probably impossible to truly get as lost anywhere in North America as Stanton is portrayed as being in the film. But this impossibility is only one of several that haunt this improbable tale.  A few other include Stanton's apparent belief that his disappearance will go unnoticed after the robbery; the fact that he is portrayed as not having ever scouted out his escape route, and therefore has no idea at all of where he is going; the fact that his bad guy accomplices somehow unerringly get from the scene of the crime to the exact same roads to nowhere he is unintentionally traveling, and do so quickly enough to literally be right on his tail; and the fact that these same accomplices not only figure out EXACTLY how to trap him, but are successful in doing so. The script even has Cain reprising one of his old Superman stunts, unbelievably successful in spite of the absence of costume or cape.To spice up Stanton's journey, Director Lemke tosses in an ominous cop on trash patrol, a catatonic old lady with a truck to sell, a spooky toothless preacher, moral lessons from one of AAA's lesser known competitors, and perhaps the worst motivational speaker to ever sell an audio tape.  None of it helps.This film is aptly titled, for the movie, like the Stanton character himself, speeds 90 miles an hour down a dead end road, and it is quite possible to sense Cain sharing Stanton's grudging relief when the whole thing comes to a predictable and bad end. ""At least it's over,"" both the actor and his character must have been thinking.It is only too bad that neither Cain nor his alter ego ever noticed the cavernous holes in this awful story; perhaps he could have driven through one, gotten clean away and against the odds lived happily ever after.",1,90 mph down a dead end road,1152921600,"07 15, 2006",2006,3781,"['Considering', 'string', 'career', 'disappointments', 'demise', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'world', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'would', 'ever', 'have', 'agreed', 'star', 'Lost', '2004', 'movie', 'Darren', 'Lemke', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'only', 'possible', 'answer', 'mind', 'Cain', 'figured', 'people', 'could', 'suspend', 'disbelieve', 'enough', 'not', 'see', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'disguise', 'then', 'maybe', 'could', 'also', 'suspend', 'enough', 'not', 'see', 'failed', 'pointless', 'movie.The', 'set-up', 'here', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'actually', 'call', 'plot', 'Cain', 'bank', 'VP', 'who', 'have', 'own', 'bank', 'robbed', 'then', 'bad', 'guys', 'who', 'stage', 'hold-up', 'behalf', 'premise', 'might', 'have', 'gone', 'far', 'hands', 'accomplished', 'screenwriter', 'Unfortunately', 'Lemke', 'acted', 'own', 'scribe', 'apparently', 'never', 'showed', 'script', 'soul', 'cameras', 'started', 'rolling', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'surmise', 'was', 'one', 'else', 'there', 'tell', 'had', 'gone', 'way', 'way', 'way', 'off', 'course.The', 'tension', 'film', 'supposed', 'come', 'three', 'facts', '1', 'Cain', 'character', 'Jeremy', 'Stanton', 'lost', 'somewhere', 'Nevada', 'desert', 'trying', 'make', 'escape', 'what', 'initially', 'be', 'perfect', 'crime', 'second', 'alleged', 'tension', 'point', 'fact', 'not', 'only', 'erstwhile', 'accomplices', 'everyone', 'else', 'west', 'Mississippi', 'have', 'quickly', 'figured', 'out', 'Stanton', 'brains', 'robbery', 'double-cross', 'third', 'final', 'bit', 'suspense', 'intended', 'come', 'fact', 'Stanton', 'cheated', 'former', 'partners', 'are', 'hot', 'trail.Regrettably', 'not', 'one', 'subplots', 'really', 'Much', 'made', 'screenplay', 'fact', 'Stanton', 'map', 'date', 'intended', 'route', 'are', 'closed', 'flooded', 'longer', 'existence', 'third', 'time', 'On-Star', 'proxy', 'telephone', 'navigation', 'aide', 'informed', 'road', 'actually', 'different', 'name', 'one', 'map', 'device', 'worn', 'dangerously', 'thin', 'point', 'fact', 'probably', 'impossible', 'truly', 'get', 'lost', 'anywhere', 'North', 'America', 'Stanton', 'portrayed', 'being', 'film', 'impossibility', 'only', 'one', 'several', 'haunt', 'improbable', 'tale', 'few', 'other', 'include', 'Stanton', 'apparent', 'belief', 'disappearance', 'will', 'go', 'unnoticed', 'robbery', 'fact', 'portrayed', 'not', 'having', 'ever', 'scouted', 'out', 'escape', 'route', 'therefore', 'idea', 'where', 'going', 'fact', 'bad', 'guy', 'accomplices', 'somehow', 'unerringly', 'get', 'scene', 'crime', 'exact', 'same', 'roads', 'nowhere', 'unintentionally', 'traveling', 'do', 'so', 'quickly', 'enough', 'literally', 'be', 'right', 'tail', 'fact', 'same', 'accomplices', 'not', 'only', 'figure', 'out', 'EXACTLY', 'how', 'trap', 'are', 'successful', 'doing', 'so', 'script', 'even', 'Cain', 'reprising', 'one', 'old', 'Superman', 'stunts', 'unbelievably', 'successful', 'spite', 'absence', 'costume', 'cape.To', 'spice', 'Stanton', 'journey', 'Director', 'Lemke', 'ominous', 'cop', 'trash', 'patrol', 'catatonic', 'old', 'lady', 'truck', 'sell', 'spooky', 'toothless', 'preacher', 'moral', 'lessons', 'one', 'AAA', 'lesser', 'known', 'competitors', 'perhaps', 'worst', 'motivational', 'speaker', 'ever', 'sell', 'audio', 'tape', 'None', 'helps.This', 'film', 'aptly', 'titled', 'movie', 'Stanton', 'character', '90', 'miles', 'hour', 'down', 'dead', 'end', 'road', 'quite', 'possible', 'sense', 'Cain', 'sharing', 'Stanton', 'grudging', 'relief', 'when', 'whole', 'thing', 'predictable', 'bad', 'end', 'least', 'over', 'actor', 'character', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'thinking.It', 'only', 'too', 'bad', 'Cain', 'alter', 'ego', 'ever', 'noticed', 'cavernous', 'holes', 'awful', 'story', 'perhaps', 'could', 'have', 'driven', 'one', 'gotten', 'clean', 'away', 'odds', 'lived', 'happily', 'ever']",Lost
