Lots of old fact too, but there is an emphasis on his childhood experiences and how they affected his judgment and behavior as an adult. And the content is truly impartial. This is not another fawning commentary on JFK. But a factual presentation of events in his life.

1661478,A3W3PK9TVKEH7Q,B00DUX291C,Allen Jackson,"[27, 43]","I was highly disappointed after viewing this on PBS the past 2 days.  The ending was a joke: first, he's in Dallas, riding in the motorcade, the VERY next scene is people hearing of his death on the radio.  I kid you not-- there's NOTHING here with any footage, audio, or even description of the shooting . . . NOR even a radio or TV interruption to say the president has been shot. Much less taken to a hospital.  Seriously!  Like they cut out a lot of footage with an ax to fit this into 4 hours.  Just 1) in a motorcade, then 2) dead. NOTHING in between!That aside, more flaws: the experts were not very expert, instead they all had constant criticisms of JFK, two men in particular; and one woman calls the president ""Jack"" throughout, though she's a writer who appears not to have been born while JFK was alive.  They mention the death in a plane of his sister Kathleen (""Kick""), failing to mention her marriage to the Duke of Devonshire (which upset her parents on religious grounds) and that he was on the plane, too (all 4 occupants died instantly)-- just, ""his sister died in a plane crash.""  Why not mention these details over a period of say, oh, 5 seconds, and breathe some life and familiarity into JFK's sister?The part on the Cuban Missile Crisis was poor, never mentioning a crucial detail occurring when the Soviets appeared to renege on what had appeared to be an acceptable offer to resolve the entire, mega-dangerous situation: how at RFK's suggestion, JFK agreed to the terms of the first (acceptable) letter from the Kremlin and ignored the second, much less cooperative, letter (that appeared to be written by Soviet hard-liners).  This omission was weak, very weak.  Again, how long would this have taken to include, 10-15 seconds?  Here again, it would have both made RFK more vivid and his relationship with JFK more clear, which wholly informs a biography of JFK.I virtually always LOVE PBS documentaries, but this one was very weak, which would be particularly clear to people who have seen good programs on JFK previously.  Someone who knows little about Kennedy will like it, and will find it awash in detail, but there's just way too much that's missing for the informed viewer.  And it's poorly balanced.A FAR better PBS production, from the 1990s, called ""American Experience: The Kennedys,"" is one of the most brilliant documentaries ever put together on any subject, in my view.  It covers JFK-- alone-- better than this one, much better, and covers the other brothers and the parents as well, again brilliantly.  I recommend that one most highly.  And INSTEAD OF this one.This one, besides being horribly edited, is NOT an educational piece so much as a biased piece with a point to make: that JFK was a poor president who learned as he went along (don't they ALL, where's the news in that?), was a womanizer to the extreme (fine, but it didn't need to be stated every 10 minutes), who was pumped with drugs every day (again, fine to include, but repeated to death throughout), and whom the ""experts"" on the show (I've heard of NONE of them before except for one) either knew little about or needed to trash.  They had his SISTER, Jean Kennedy Smith on this program . . . and I believe they had her speak all of TWICE, or little more, in four hours.This should not be anyone's intro to this president, nor does it handle any aspect of his presidency or upbringing in a way that adds to the body of knowledge of those of us who know something about the subject, which a 4-hour show should do; it's forever short on details.  And there's ZIP on the assassination-- by far the most examined murder in history, and one of the saddest and most shocking days in all of US history.  But to THESE film makers, apparently, merely a minute or two of at least the news coverage THAT DAY, Nov. 22, 1963 (with, say, Cronkite sadly announcing that the news was official and the president has died, or ANYTHING of this ilk) was not worthy of this program!  Seriously?  Material on the assassination just seems to me to have been, in all likelihood, inserted but then chopped out--TOTALLY, that's 100%--by a seriously unqualified editor.  Not asking for ANYTHING on conspiracy theories here or resolving the case; just please cover a few moments from the report of bullets fired at the president's motorcade, please.I'd add, finally, that the anti-JFK bias of this program was very unusual for me to see in a PBS production.  Significant, clear bias either way would have been disappointing to me in a PBS documentary, and this had it.  For maybe the first time that I'd ever seen on PBS.  Then, a few days later, I viewed a 2010 PBS documentary, ""Nixon's The One: The '68 Election and How It Changed America.""  Sadly, the narration by Dick Cavett on that (presumably reading a script) was very biased against Nixon and was even--so unprofessionally--sarcastic, and though I'm not a Nixon fan, obvious bias makes a viewer wonder about the accuracy of such ""documentaries.""  Hence, my problem with the JFK program, which I'd guess dwelt on several negatives to provide the appearance of balance-- in lieu of being another loving tribute to JFK-- but which, to me, went overboard on the negatives.-- UPDATE a day later -- I see that, already, two people have given this review a thumbs-down.  Since this review is detailed, heavy on facts about the program, and obviously would help ANY shopper considering this product-- whatever their political stripe, and whether one agrees with my opinions-- clearly this review has been voted down by some only because I like JFK, the person, and have pointed out why this broadcast is an overtly negative ""unbiased documentary"".  Hey, folks, if the review can help shoppers, you shouldn't knock it merely because it disagrees with your own like/dislike of the product, or your political beliefs. Lots of product info is included here, even if you disagree with my overall dissatisfaction.In sum: a weak JFK documentary, and poorly edited.  Not recommended.  If there wasn't an abundance of better material on JFK out there already, I'd recommend this as opposed to nothing.  In fact, it's worth a viewing, I suppose, but I sure wouldn't buy it (intending to view it multiple times in the future, as if it's a key resource).  Once is enough.",2,"Very negative, not balanced, uses questionable ""experts""",1384300800,"11 13, 2013",2013,6298,"['was', 'highly', 'disappointed', 'viewing', 'PBS', 'past', '2', 'days', 'ending',

This one does seem to attack The former President and claims he did not accomplish very much in his time in the White House.  while it is clear that John F. Kennedy had some big mishaps ranging from the Bay of Pigs to the over throw of the South Vietnamese leader, in fact he was accomplished as President.  Everyone should remember that the world could have been much different had a nuclear exchange occurred.  It didn't because Kennedy and Khrushchev were able to agree to remove the missiles despite both being advised to fire on the other by the respective military commanders.  Next, Kennedy called for the Mission to place an American on the moon.  While this occurred after his assassination and with, Congress funded because he convince us as Americans we could accomplish it If we set out to.  A lot of the technology we have today including the ability to type reviews on this website came from computer advances brought on by the Space program.  The Peace Corps and its creation also came from his leadership.  This film asserts idea that he didn't care about civil rights. As a matter of fact, Mr.  Kennedy gave a speech before his death which called for an end to discrimination on the basis of Race.  He also placed a personal phone call to Mrs.  King.  While he definitely gained a political advantage by doing it, the mere fact that he did it, showed courage in spite of his own party's pro segregation views.

My generation still has faded memories of that America, but we were so young that it seems to us now as a ghost-like dream, a mental daguerreotype. By the time we came of age a decade or so later, this place was damaged - cynical and jaded. Maybe one day the United States will recover from what happened on November 22nd 1963, but I suppose it won't be until the last survivor with a conscious memory of those four dark days passes from the scene.2013 has been a year filled with so many half-century milestones that it is difficult to keep track of them all. 1963 was indeed a year of historical landmarks - beautiful and not-so-beautiful. You know you're starting to get up there in years when you can clearly recall events from fifty years ago. I would only come to appreciate what a historical year 1963 was as I got older. From Civil Rights on earth, to the exploration of the heavens, President Kennedy's murder on the streets of Dallas, Texas fifty-years-ago today was merely the curtain closing on one of the most monumental years of the American Century. Wasn't that a time?He still matters fifty years later.

Although the documentary repeatedly mentioned that JFK was not great by the standards that usually are used to measure Presidential greatness,  and this perhaps because his Presidency was cut short,  I think JFK,  although flawed, and despite the fact that his Presidency was cut short,  was a better President than many other Presidents we have had,  better than some Presidents whom the makers of this documentary would deem &#34;great.&#34;This documentary does everyone a service by covering the facts concerning the civil rights movement at that time,  including the fact that Martin Luther King,  Jr.,  and most other blacks were Republicans before Kennedy spoke up in their defense.  King and most other blacks became Democrats only because Kennedy,  a Democrat,  defended them when Nixon kept quiet and would not get involved.  (Also, the Ku Klux Klan was Democrat--perhaps most people don't know this.)  These facts are enlightening,  and should remind everyone to not put party over principle.  One of the things I most admire about John F. Kennedy was that he did not follow party lines just to follow party lines.  Very often he sided with the Republicans on issues.  He followed his conscience in those matters,  in spite of the fact that it infuriated Johnson and others in his party.President Kennedy was more conservative than his party is today--perhaps more so than the Establishment Republicans of today, also.I loved the way the documentary spoke of his health problems.  The man has my great admiration and sympathy for the way that he thought and worked in spite of this tremendous hardship.  Excellent documentary.
