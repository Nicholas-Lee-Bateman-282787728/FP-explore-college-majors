I was not too impressed about the battle scenes. I was hoping to have more sequences of the bad guys and the goods guys with all the characters in the movie. Instead they restricted most of the power abilities they could have shown in the movie. If they have took the effort to make a great movie, there would have made enough money to make a trilogy. Within the story line of the games, there was a whole lot more going on in the story then what they showed in the movie. I own the movie and regardless of its aweful film, I bought it because its my favourite game. I am glad another Samurai Shodown game cam out onto the Playstation 2. I was so upset about SNK disapearing forever..(Really the person who made this movie should realize that its a Japanese game, so it should've been spelled correctly.

The animation is badly done, the voice acting sub-par --the voices don't even match the characters very well -- and the frequent action sequences are retro to the extreme and just don't look good....

372870,A1CJQPZGJB2DSJ,630340264X,"""solarnight""","[2, 3]","Simply put, Samurai Shodown is a below average action anime with average dubbing and average art. It is fighting game anime that takes the story from the game and does pretty much nothing with it. Buuuut, that doesn't mean it doesn't have its good parts. In fact, there is a pretty good dose of drama at the scene that occurs after the part when Haohmaru defeats Earthquake, and it's done very well in the dub. Speaking of dubbing, Haohmaru's voice is great (thank goodness, he's the main character), but supporting roles, uh, suck. Galford shows about as much emotion as Amakusa (which is null, by the way), Hanzo's voice is too deep for its own good, and Gen-An is just plain funny.  The action scenes in this movie are flat out average.The one thing that almost redeemed the entire movie was the ultra-cool ending theme (not the English credits. Stick around until the Japanese credits roll). Not only does it show additional characters and awesome fight scenes that weren't in the movie (weird), but the nice ending theme, sung in Japanese, is subtitled, with pronunciations! Anyway, if you don't mind a generic plot and want a bit of action, give it a rent.",2,Video-game-based anime at its worst.,992995200,"06 20, 2001",2001,1162,"['Simply', 'put', 'Samurai', 'Shodown', 'below', 'average', 'action', 'anime', 'average', 'dubbing', 'average', 'art', 'fighting', 'game', 'anime', 'story', 'game', 'pretty', 'much', 'nothing', 'Buuuut', ""n't"", 'mean', ""n't"", 'have', 'good', 'parts', 'fact', 'pretty', 'good', 'dose', 'drama', 'scene', 'part', 'when', 'Haohmaru', 'defeats', 'Earthquake', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'dub', 'Speaking', 'dubbing', 'Haohmaru', 'voice', 'great', 'thank', 'goodness', 'main', 'character', 'supporting', 'roles', 'uh', 'suck', 'Galford', 'as', 'much', 'emotion', 'Amakusa', 'null', 'way', 'Hanzo', 'voice', 'too', 'deep', 'own', 'good', 'Gen-An', 'just', 'plain', 'funny', 'action', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'flat', 'average.The', 'one', 'thing', 'almost', 'redeemed', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'ultra-cool', 'ending', 'theme', 'not', 'English', 'credits', 'Stick', 'Japanese', 'credits', 'roll', 'Not', 'only', 'show', 'additional', 'characters', 'awesome', 'fight', 'scenes', 'were', ""n't"", 'movie', 'weird', 'nice', 'ending', 'theme', 'sung', 'Japanese', 'subtitled', 'pronunciations', 'Anyway', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'generic', 'plot', 'want', 'bit', 'action', 'give', 'rent']",Samurai Showdown VHS
