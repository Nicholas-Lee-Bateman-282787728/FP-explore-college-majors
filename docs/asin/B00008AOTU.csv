Despite being primarily a stylish thriller - which is not usually my thing - this one has all the character elements that make a film worthwhile for me.The beatific Daniel Newman, as Tom, plays the character's exterior sexy insouciance perfectly, but keeps his broken boy vulnerability just close enough to the surface to be utterly heartbreaking - sort of a buffed up, new Millennium version of Davy Jones as the Artful Dodger. And this kid is my favourite sort of character - completely damaged goods in a cool, attractive package. That he finds some semblance of love late in the film, and in the least likely of places, has caused a bit of outrage among some viewers, but in the context of the story it made perfect sense to me.  The mystery of Tom's tragic life, and the basis for his fear and distrust of men, is slowly [and poignantly] revealed in brief, wordless flashbacks.Be warned, this is NOT a feel good film. It's violent, depressing, ugly and doesn't end particularly well. I'll even cop to fast-forwarding past two scenes of torture because I just wasn't up for it.

A couple of over the top psychos, one a mob type the other a dirty cop, sexually abuse a kept young man, who's living the only life he thought he could until, through some rather rash and urgent circumstances he finds a connection with his true hetero identity. The story plays a few tricks with the audience by setting up false expectations which I think were a little uncalled for,  but once things are revealed the turn out is just unsatisfying. For me it wasn't the outcome so much as how it all played out. Take no lessons from this, although I can see how some could see this film as homophobic. The antagonists with gay traits are actually pedophiles and sadistic monsters and the protagonist is a victim of sexual abuse. It's not a gay story. It's slow moving and about 30 mins too long with a couple of unnecessary scenes just to exhibit a point. The bad guys are one dimensional, torture scenes appear without merit or logic.

Near the end, I was truly wondering how it would end. I don't remember ever caring about the ending of a movie before.I'm not squeamish, but the torture scene in the barber's chair was a bit much, and really unnecessary, since the victim was not even told what was wanted of him.Even though the movie is British, the two cars were a Mercedes and a BMW, a good choice of cars.Daniel Newman's wardrobe was extensive; he changed shirts even in the same scene, sometimes more than once. The shot of his butt in the shower was not good; it seemed misshapen and pearshaped like that of a woman.

737294,A1X1RWRPSAL206,B00008AOTU,"interested_observer ""interested_observer""","[1, 1]","""Endgame"" is an interestingly ambiguous story of how a kept London rent-boy seeks safety when his sugar daddy comes to a deserved bad end.  Tom (played by Daniel Newman) is kept up in an opulent London apartment by wealthy George Norris (played by Mark McGann).  While his family unsuspectingly lives the good life in Surrey, George deals drugs and blackmails in London, supported by a crooked detective, Frank Dunston (played by John Benfield).  George and Frank inflict rough sex on Tom as rent, as well as create blackmail videotapes from Tom's tricking.  One day Tom resists, and George ends up dead.  Knowing that the police will be unsympathetic, Tom seeks help from some recent acquaintances, a neighboring couple from America (Max and Nikki Bergman, played by Corey Johnson and Toni Barry, respectively), who have just purchased a cottage in Wales.  When Tom convinces the couple to help him flee, the three drive to the cottage.  Crooked Frank has ways of finding things out, and the film moves to its climax.Although there was a variety of accents, attentive listeners should understand almost everything.  The outdoor scenes in Gwynedd (north-west Wales) were very beautiful (and didn't need commentary or orchestral swell to make the point).  There were many skin shots, mainly of Tom, a hottie.  The acting was good, especially by the bad guys.  Be warned that there is considerable violence shown in scenes of collecting money, interrogation, and in some sex scenes.  One interrogation scene involving a car and a barber chair is far-fetched but riveting.  The direction keeps the movie flowing at a brisk pace.The movie is ambiguous on a number of issues.  Was George's death really an accident?  Why were Max and Nikki so accommodating?  What was the real dynamic between Tom and Nikki?  Did Tom end up where he belonged?  There is a plot hole or two as well.  Viewers will interpret as they wish.The extras were the trailer to ""Endgame"" and to three other films.  There was no director's commentary, making-of, behind-the-scenes, photo gallery,  deleted scenes, or written list of chapter names.""Endgame"" gives the viewer a good look at a kept boy who fell in with a very wrong crowd and needs a change.

737298,AFOK05KDCHSHL,B00008AOTU,Libretio,"[36, 38]","ENDGAME(UK - 2001)DVD aspect ratio: 1.33:1Theatrical aspect ratio: 1.85:1Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby DigitalA beautiful London rent boy (Daniel Newman) seeks the help of a sympathetic American couple (Toni Barry and Corey Johnson) when he accidentally kills the vicious gangster (Mark McGann) who's been acting as his pimp. They flee to a cottage in the Welsh countryside, pursued by a corrupt police officer (John Benfield) featured on a number of incriminating videotapes which Newman has taken with him...Gary Wicks' feature debut ENDGAME is both ambitious and compelling, yet also deeply flawed. Though economical in terms of budget and narrative scale, the film's production values are high, and the cast is a veritable who's-who of familiar British faces. McGann's seedy villain is a study in concentrated evil, obsessed with power and violence, and completely indifferent to human suffering, while Benfield (most recognizable to US audiences from his recurring appearance in TV's ""Prime Suspect"") exudes quiet menace as a debauched authority figure, desperate to reclaim his soiled dignity.Central to the film's success, however, is Daniel Newman, an elfin beauty who began his career as a child actor in TV dramas such as 15: THE LIFE AND DEATH OF PHILIP KNIGHT (1993) and ""The Borrowers"" (1993), supplementing his theatre and TV appearances with brief supporting roles in various UK-lensed Hollywood blockbusters (ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES, BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA, etc.) until he became old enough to tackle the challenges of unconventional adult roles, such as the recalcitrant drug addict in JUNK (1999), and the troubled teenager who forms part of a bisexual love triangle in SPEAK LIKE A CHILD (1998). Here, his physical beauty is employed in a manner which renders him sympathetic and childlike, and his low-key performance anchors the entire film.Overall, the characters and pacing may be a little muted, and some of the the lapses in logic are too significant to ignore (Barry and Johnson's reaction to Newman's crime is simply not credible), but Wicks succeeds in generating a mood of operatic tragedy, helped in no small measure by attractive location photography (by David Bennett) and a memorable music score by Adrian Thomas. The film is hideously violent in places, but most of it is suggested rather than shown, despite what you may have heard elsewhere.But, for all its grandeur, the movie is compromised by an unnecessary plot development which seems calculated to provoke outraged disbelief: From the outset, Newman plays his character with gestures and mannerisms that clearly define him as a young gay man, and Wicks (whose resum&eacute; includes an executive producer credit on MOMENTS WITH JOHAN [1996], a softcore ode to European porn star Johan Paulik) makes a virtue of Newman's exquisite splendor, presenting him either shirtless or naked in every other scene and directing Bennett's camera to savor (almost) every inch of Newman's glorious, sculpted body. But all of the gay sex scenes involve violence and coercion, during which Newman is brutalized and dominated by McGann and his disgusting cronies, while the only sexual tenderness he experiences is with a woman (Barry), who takes pity on his loneliness and fragility! This, despite the fact that it's Barry's husband (Johnson) who invites Newman into their lives, paving the way for an altogether more believable storyline in which Newman's character could have experienced his first moment of romance with another man. The fact that it happens with a woman is both inappropriate and offensive, and it suggests nothing more than a sop to commercial fortunes, skewing the film towards a gay audience whilst simultaneously appeasing potential straight viewers, an approach which satisfies no one and defies all narrative logic. That said, however, the plot is reasonably engaging and the performances are superb, while the fetishization of Newman's fabulous torso provides more than enough compensation for the movie's thematic shortcomings. Recommended, but with serious reservations.TLA Releasing's all-region DVD presents the movie in full-screen format only, unmasking an amount of 'dead space' at the bottom of the frame and opening up the original 1.85:1 image gathered in the upper portion of the screen, so viewers with 16:9 TV's can simply zoom into the image and scroll to the top of the picture for an approximation of the original theatrical experience (an accompanying trailer is appropriately framed at 1.85:1). Though a letterboxed version would have been preferable, TLA's full-screen presentation offers a more revealing view of Newman's nude scenes than the theatrical print, particularly during a memorable slow-motion shower sequence which positively revels in his nakedness.NB. An earlier VHS version contained full-frontal nudity from Newman during the aforementioned shower sequence, but the DVD has been deliberately reframed to obscure everything below the waist, very likely at the actor's request.",3,"Recommended, but with serious reservations",1050451200,"04 16, 2003",2003,5017,"['ENDGAME', 'UK', '2001', 'DVD', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.33:1Theatrical', 'aspect',

Regardless I can only speak for myself in that a brief synopsis is one thing and a scene by scene account of the story is quite another - neither of which I find particularly appealing.It's been a decade since I first saw ""Endgame' I was impressed with the film then and equally impressed with it now having streamed it on Amazon just a few days ago.A mere ten years ago and with very few exceptions GLBT people were usually confined in film to comic relief, AIDS victims or tragic desolate figures. Things have changed for the better and it's refreshing and positive to see Gay people and the story lines that define the films and television shows devoid of one dimensional stereotypes and worse - apologies for who they are.That said, the fact that the lead character is a gay prostitute ( rent boy)  is no more homophobic than Jane Fonda's role in the unforgettable masterpiece ""Klute"" is heterophobic. The story line of ""Endgame"" is independent of sexual orientation and for it's time a brave undertaking that remains as relevant today as it was when it was first released.This is a dark and disturbing film with a deliberate ""seedy"" underbelly. Director and writer Gary Wicks is quite masterful at creating a solemn feeling of dread, surprising plot twists and at times albeit brief a greatly played cat and mouse thriller.To see Endgame as only a story of Tom a beautiful rent boy is dismissive and not the core nor even a fringe elements of subplots which abound here.For the most part the cast is solid. Mark Megan is excellent as the amoral Gangster who keeps Tom in a rented loft which although is great looking home equipped with every creature comfort it is an emotional and physical prison.John Benfield is superb as the equally sinister corrupt cop - and although his screen time is but a fraction of Megans it's ruthless performance. The film is carried and carried well by  Daniel Newman as Tom. A victim of his own life and a horrific childhood of sexual abuse made me understand the infinite truth of fleeting physical beauty - it saves no one.Endgame reminds us that we can't change the past we can only choose to live above the pain of unfortunate circumstances - and that the quest for self worth and esteem, for acceptance and love is a Nobel journey.Highly recommended.",4,Excellent Dark Thriller Holds The Test Of Time,1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,2421,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'understood', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'reviewers', 'film', 'be', 'novice', 'professional', 'feel', 'compelled', 'tell', 'entire', 'story', 'line', 'can', 'only', 'speak', 'brief', 'synopsis', 'one', 'thing', 'scene', 'scene', 'account', 'story', 'quite', 'neither', 'find', 'particularly', 'appealing.It', 'been', 'decade', 'first', 'saw', 'Endgame', 'was', 'impressed', 'film', 'then', 'equally', 'impressed', 'now', 'having', 'streamed', 'Amazon', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'ago.A', 'mere', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'very', 'few', 'exceptions', 'GLBT', 'people', 'were', 'usually', 'confined', 'film', 'comic', 'relief', 'AIDS', 'victims', 'tragic', 'desolate', 'figures', 'Things', 'have', 'changed', 'better', 'refreshing', 'positive', 'see', 'Gay', 'people', 'story', 'lines', 'define', 'films', 'television', 'shows', 'devoid', 'one', 'dimensional', 'stereotypes', 'worse', 'apologies', 'who', 'are.That', 'said', 'fact', 'lead', 'character', 'gay', 'prostitute', 'rent', 'boy', 'more', 'homophobic', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'role', 'unforgettable', 'masterpiece', 'Klute', 'heterophobic', 'story', 'line', 'Endgame', 'independent', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'time', 'brave', 'undertaking', 'relevant', 'today', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released.This', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'film', 'deliberate', 'seedy', 'underbelly', 'Director', 'writer', 'Gary', 'Wicks', 'quite', 'masterful', 'creating', 'solemn', 'feeling', 'dread', 'surprising', 'plot', 'twists', 'times', 'albeit', 'brief', 'greatly', 'played', 'cat', 'mouse', 'thriller.To', 'see', 'Endgame', 'only', 'story', 'Tom', 'beautiful', 'rent', 'boy', 'dismissive', 'not', 'core', 'even', 'fringe', 'elements', 'subplots', 'abound', 'most', 'part', 'cast', 'solid', 'Mark', 'Megan', 'excellent', 'amoral', 'Gangster', 'who', 'Tom', 'rented', 'loft', 'great', 'looking', 'home', 'equipped', 'creature', 'comfort', 'emotional', 'physical', 'prison.John', 'Benfield', 'superb', 'equally', 'sinister', 'corrupt', 'cop', 'screen', 'time', 'fraction', 'Megans', 'ruthless', 'performance', 'film', 'carried', 'carried', 'well', 'Daniel', 'Newman', 'Tom', 'A', 'victim', 'own', 'life', 'horrific', 'childhood', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'made', 'understand', 'infinite', 'truth', 'fleeting', 'physical', 'beauty', 'one.Endgame', 'ca', ""n't"", 'change', 'past', 'can', 'only', 'choose', 'live', 'pain', 'unfortunate', 'circumstances', 'quest', 'self', 'worth', 'esteem', 'acceptance', 'love', 'Nobel', 'journey.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

What seems to be another hustler movie, it develops into a cat and mouse thriller, and becomes other than just another ""gay"" movie.The story revolves around a very high priced hustler (rent boy) who lives in a plush, expensive apartment provided by his pimp. Tom (Daniel Newman) is a real handsome young man with an equal body. George is the sadistic pimp, violent man who deals in drugs with a crooked cop Dunston, who gets free sex from Tom. He is getting cold feet and tells George that he wants to back out of any more deals. He has one more sexual session with Tom who tapes all of his encounters in a secret room where he has sex. Interesting enough George is shown in the beginning with his normal, handsome family, going to his son's violin's recital.Tom meets an American couple who are his neighbors and becomes friends, Max (Corey Johnson) and Nikki (Toni Barry). One night they invite Tom for dinner while George arrives at Tom's apartment for a dose of violent, erotic, sadistic treatment with Tom, which is how he gets his kick. After Tom leaves his friends and goes back to his apartment, George starts beating him up. Tom pushes George, who falls and cracks his head on a table, dying. Tom panics and goes to Max and Nikki covered in blood. He asked for help to get him away and no call to the police. The American hesitate but finally giving in. They take him to a cottage they own in the country side.After the police arrives at Tom's apartment, Dunston who is in charge of the case, discovers the secret room and all of the tapes which Tom has made. Dunston starts eliminating people in very brutal way. Max leaves the cottage and Nikki and Tom are left behind. Tom has sex with Nikki. Dunston murders Max to find out the location of the cottage. Dunston arrives at the cottage, Nikki gets shot to death as an accident. Tom hits Dunston (I am not sure if he died), and evidence was sent to his police department about him.At the end of the movie, Tom is shown with a very rich older man as a couple.It could be said that the acting of Tom as a gay is very put on (as someone else reviewed.) Tom comes out as a cross of a drag queen with one those guys with greasy hair out the 60's (West Side Story.) But you have to look beyond and see a credible thriller. Clips of his troubled childhood are shown throughout the movie reminds us the gay aspects of the story, but the psychopath cop takes the movie to another level.
