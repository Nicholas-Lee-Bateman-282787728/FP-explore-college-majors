I saw this DVD in the sale rack at [a physical store] for less than seven bucks.  What could I lose since it's just over ?  After watching this short film (less than an hour) I became a full fledged fan.The prison escape is absolutely priceless.  Now I'm on Amazon looking for more Red Skelton films.",5,Now I'm a fan,1019088000,"04 18, 2002",2002,399,"['Up', 'yesterday', 'had', 'only', 'heard', 'Red', 'Skelton', 'saw', 'few', 'clips', 'TV', 'time', 'time', 'saw', 'DVD', 'sale', 'rack', '[', 'physical', 'store', ']', 'less', 'seven', 'bucks', 'What', 'could', 'lose', 'just', 'watching', 'short', 'film', 'less', 'hour', 'became', 'full', 'fledged', 'fan.The', 'prison', 'escape', 'absolutely', 'priceless', 'Now', ""'m"", 'Amazon', 'looking', 'more', 'Red', 'Skelton', 'films']",N/A

Then I watched & was completely bowled over by comedian Red Skelton's antics! What a standard feature film takes (approx. 90 mins.), this T.V. episode of ""Climax"" does in a compact 48 mins. About a well-meaning shnook who invests in uranium from a pair of con artists, then is set up to take the fall & is sent to prison, Skelton is simply hilarious here. An inspired clown/pantomimist, Skelton makes every joke, sight gag & facial reaction count. The prison break segment by itself is just hysterical!A nice little piece of vintage 1956 television to add to my (and your) collection!",5,"Proof that Skelton's the perfect ""pigeon"" for comedy",1296259200,"01 29, 2011",2011,702,"['first', 'was', 'disappointed', 'was', 'not', 'movie', 'version', 'original', 'teleplay', 'Public', 'Pigeon', 'No', '1', 'Then', 'watched', 'was', 'completely', 'bowled', 'over', 'comedian', 'Red', 'Skelton', 'antics', 'What', 'standard', 'feature', 'film', 'approx', '90', 'mins', 'T.V', 'episode', 'Climax', 'compact', '48', 'mins', 'well-meaning', 'shnook', 'who', 'uranium', 'pair', 'con', 'artists', 'then', 'set', 'up', 'take', 'fall', 'sent', 'prison', 'Skelton', 'simply', 'hilarious', 'here', 'inspired', 'clown/pantomimist', 'Skelton', 'joke', 'sight', 'gag', 'facial', 'reaction', 'count', 'prison', 'break', 'segment', 'just', 'hysterical', 'nice', 'little', 'piece', 'vintage', '1956', 'television', 'add', 'collection']",N/A
