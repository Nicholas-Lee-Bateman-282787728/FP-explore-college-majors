1168703,A1SLVEBLUCOCO2,B001AXTV6A,T. N.,"[3, 13]","My opinion about Daniel O'Donnell is a mixed one. I love many of his songs, yet many other songs also sung by him bore me to death. He may sound sweet and gentle and soothing, but he may also sound bland and untalented, which is really strange. Now on DVDs he looks fine when he was filmed outdoors, but on stage he is absolutely horrible. The way he moves and his gestures are so effeminate and irritating I couldn't bear looking. Why couldn't the guy just walk instead of jumping in small steps like a little girl? What on earth did he dip his knees in the middle of a song for? No wonder there were few men in the audience, and none of them smiled. They must have been bullied by their wives into coming to the show. Now I know Daniel is better heard than seen. I will continue listen to his music, but seeing him on stage is a big no for me. Sorry, Daniel.",2,Not so good,1223510400,"10 9, 2008",2008,860,"['opinion', 'Daniel', ""O'Donnell"", 'mixed', 'one', 'love', 'many', 'songs', 'yet', 'many', 'other', 'songs', 'also', 'sung', 'bore', 'death', 'may', 'sound', 'sweet', 'gentle', 'soothing', 'may', 'also', 'sound', 'bland', 'untalented', 'really', 'strange', 'Now', 'DVDs', 'fine', 'when', 'was', 'filmed', 'outdoors', 'stage', 'absolutely', 'horrible', 'way', 'gestures', 'are', 'so', 'effeminate', 'irritating', 'could', ""n't"", 'bear', 'looking', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'guy', 'just', 'walk', 'instead', 'jumping', 'small', 'steps', 'little', 'girl', 'What', 'earth', 'did', 'dip', 'knees', 'middle', 'song', 'wonder', 'were', 'few', 'men', 'audience', 'none', 'smiled', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'bullied', 'wives', 'coming', 'show', 'Now', 'know', 'Daniel', 'better', 'heard', 'seen', 'will', 'continue', 'listen', 'music', 'seeing', 'stage', 'big', 'no', 'Sorry', 'Daniel']",N/A
