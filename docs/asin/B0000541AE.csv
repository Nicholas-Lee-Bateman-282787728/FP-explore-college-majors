First and foremost, the mysterious madam whose way of dealing with wayward merchandise is to rub them off.  What?  She kills her own golden geese?  Second: the directors obvious fixation with anal sex--including at least two totally gratuitous ""rape scenes, both happening to the ""top"" male character.  Third, an ending that makes you want to shoot the director--a total cop out in the most classic homophobic tradition.  And i could even add a fourth, a character that does naked cleaning while covering his jewels with one hand, whereas seconds later he is supposedly administeringto the sexual needs of his paralyzed client!!!!",1,Disappointing,1243555200,"05 29, 2009",2009,687,"['disappointing', 'movie', 'full', 'logical', 'inconsistencies', 'First', 'foremost', 'mysterious', 'madam', 'way', 'dealing', 'wayward', 'merchandise', 'rub', 'off', 'What', 'own', 'golden', 'geese', 'Second', 'directors', 'obvious', 'fixation', 'anal', 'sex', 'including', 'least', 'two', 'totally', 'gratuitous', 'rape', 'scenes', 'happening', 'top', 'male', 'character', 'Third', 'ending', 'want', 'shoot', 'director', 'total', 'cop', 'most', 'classic', 'homophobic', 'tradition', 'i', 'could', 'even', 'add', 'fourth', 'character', 'naked', 'cleaning', 'covering', 'jewels', 'one', 'hand', 'whereas', 'later', 'supposedly', 'administeringto', 'sexual', 'needs', 'paralyzed', 'client']",Skin & Bone

566227,A1Y7C52533BA2H,B0000541AE,Blake Fraina,"[4, 6]","Sleazy film about an LA escort service that caters to clients with elaborate [mostly S&M] fantasies and the hustlers who work there while trying to get their break in the film industry. Writer/director Everett Lewis wants to eat his cake and have it too, decrying the exploitation of these men while putting his own actors on prurient display for the delectation of his audience. In one scene, a casting director asks the protagonist if he would be willing to do nudity for a film, to which the protagonist replies, with indignation, ""I'm an artist."" The irony is that B. Wyatt, the actor in that scene, appears here nude as often as he does clothed. Hypocrisy, bad acting, bad production quality and an absurd neo-noirish sub-plot make this film a big thumbs down. The only pleasures I derived from this one were the surprise of a brief appearance by David (credited here as Fernando) Arquette as a high strung john who has disfigured one of the rent boys with a hot iron and watching actor Alan Boyce as Dean, coyly cupping his package in every one of his many nude scenes. Watching him sweep the floor with one hand is priceless. What's he hiding under there anyway? Not recommended.",2,Hypocritical Sleaze,1204502400,"03 3, 2008",2008,1186,"['Sleazy', 'film', 'LA', 'escort', 'service', 'clients', 'elaborate', '[', 'mostly', 'S', 'M', ']', 'fantasies', 'hustlers', 'who', 'work', 'there', 'trying', 'get', 'break', 'film', 'industry', 'Writer/director', 'Everett', 'Lewis', 'eat', 'cake', 'have', 'too', 'decrying', 'exploitation', 'men', 'putting', 'own', 'actors', 'prurient', 'display', 'delectation', 'audience', 'one', 'scene', 'casting', 'director', 'protagonist', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'do', 'nudity', 'film', 'protagonist', 'replies', 'indignation', ""'m"", 'artist', 'irony', 'B.', 'Wyatt', 'actor', 'scene', 'here', 'nude', 'as', 'often', 'clothed', 'Hypocrisy', 'bad', 'acting', 'bad', 'production', 'quality', 'absurd', 'neo-noirish', 'sub-plot', 'make', 'film', 'big', 'thumbs', 'down', 'only', 'derived', 'one', 'were', 'surprise', 'brief', 'appearance', 'David', 'credited', 'here', 'Fernando', 'Arquette', 'high', 'strung', 'john', 'who', 'disfigured', 'one', 'rent', 'hot', 'iron', 'watching', 'actor', 'Alan', 'Boyce', 'Dean', 'coyly', 'cupping', 'package', 'one', 'many', 'nude', 'scenes', 'Watching', 'sweep', 'floor', 'one', 'hand', 'priceless', 'What', 'hiding', 'anyway', 'Not', 'recommended']",Skin & Bone
566228,A30R6HEYBNOJX8,B0000541AE,J. Edkin,"[13, 17]","A Flaccid ThrillerThis is a movie that is completely undone by its ending.""Skin & Bone"" falls into the ""hustler life"" subcategory of queer movies.  The central character is Harry (B. Wyatt), an aspiring actor who hustles for a living, treating each job as a chance to hone his acting abilities.  He works for Ghislaine (Nicole Dillenberg) and is assigned the task of helping train the newest member of her stable, Dean (Alan Boyce).  Harry and Dean turn tricks with both women and men.  It's all a matter of economics for them, although Dean is still new enough to the business that he still gets off getting off with his female clients.Writer/director Everett Lewis uses unconventional structure and technique to tell his story, and the filmmaking is interesting.  When the script is focusing on the dehumanizing elements of their lives and the profession of selling their bodies, it is interesting and the acting is professional, if not terribly exciting.  Unfortunately, Lewis's script takes a turn into the melodramatic (a common element in the ""hustler life"" genre), and the last act of the movie fails because of it.  I found the ending, intended to be tragic, to be completely unbelievable--relying on a character to be such a complete idiot that he didn't realize what was happening.I would strongly suggest that you rent this movie before you consider buying it.  If the ""hustler life"" genre appeals to you, then you might want to check out ""johns"" and much more interesting (if for location and culture alone) ""Mandragora"", although I don't strongly recommend either.  ""L.I.E."" (not yet released on video or DVD) is better than these three titles, but it is not without its own flaws.  If you want to see a really taut thriller about life on the streets, although not a queer film, then I would definitely recommend ""Where the Day Takes You."".....",1,A Flaccid Thriller,1009584000,"12 29, 2001",2001,1857,"['Flaccid', 'ThrillerThis', 'movie', 'completely', 'undone', 'ending', 'Skin', 'Bone', 'hustler', 'life', 'subcategory', 'queer', 'movies', 'central', 'character', 'Harry', 'B.', 'Wyatt', 'aspiring', 'actor', 'who', 'living', 'treating', 'job', 'chance', 'hone', 'acting', 'abilities', 'Ghislaine', 'Nicole', 'Dillenberg', 'assigned', 'task', 'helping', 'train', 'newest', 'member', 'stable', 'Dean', 'Alan', 'Boyce', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'turn', 'tricks', 'women', 'men', 'matter', 'economics', 'Dean', 'still', 'new', 'enough', 'business', 'still', 'getting', 'off', 'female', 'clients.Writer/director', 'Everett', 'Lewis', 'unconventional', 'structure', 'technique', 'tell', 'story', 'filmmaking', 'interesting', 'When', 'script', 'focusing', 'dehumanizing', 'elements', 'lives', 'profession', 'selling', 'bodies', 'interesting', 'acting', 'professional', 'not', 'terribly', 'exciting', 'Unfortunately', 'Lewis', 'script', 'turn', 'melodramatic', 'common', 'element', 'hustler', 'life', 'genre', 'last', 'act', 'movie', 'found', 'ending', 'intended', 'be', 'tragic', 'be', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'relying', 'character', 'be', 'such', 'complete', 'idiot', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'what', 'was', 'happening.I', 'would', 'strongly', 'suggest', 'rent', 'movie', 'consider', 'buying', 'hustler', 'life', 'genre', 'appeals', 'then', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'johns', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'location', 'culture', 'alone', 'Mandragora', 'do', ""n't"", 'strongly', 'recommend', 'either', 'L.I.E', 'not', 'yet', 'released', 'video', 'DVD', 'better', 'three', 'titles', 'not', 'own', 'flaws', 'want', 'see', 'really', 'taut', 'thriller', 'life', 'streets', 'not', 'queer', 'film', 'then', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'Where', 'Day', 'Takes', '..']",Skin & Bone

566230,A2SE9F3RBSJQEH,B0000541AE,Thierry,"[1, 1]","I like Everett Lewis' movies. His characters are always quirky, kind of at the edge of society and the actors he chooses to play their parts, are well chosen and provide great dialogue. I've watched this thing two times, and my response is that it's kind of a mess. No clear story lines about the three male prostitutes, doesn't really add up to much,and like a foreign art movie that is supposed to have some deep meaning, to the ordinary observer, it looks like a piece of crap.It is difficult to have any sympathy for any of the characters here. No one makes any real connections with each other, and the film ambles along much like three semi-connected nightmare dreams sequences involving people who are on the road to nowhere. A much better choice in terms of the subject matter here would be Andy Warhol's Heat. Skin and Bone could have been a much better film. Would like to see Everett Lewis redo it today and see what he could come with. His later films are much better.",2,Kind of a mess,1348185600,"09 21, 2012",2012,980,"['like', 'Everett', 'Lewis', 'movies', 'characters', 'are', 'always', 'quirky', 'kind', 'edge', 'society', 'actors', 'play', 'parts', 'are', 'well', 'chosen', 'provide', 'great', 'dialogue', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'thing', 'two', 'times', 'response', 'kind', 'mess', 'clear', 'story', 'lines', 'three', 'male', 'prostitutes', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'up', 'much', 'foreign', 'art', 'movie', 'supposed', 'have', 'deep', 'meaning', 'ordinary', 'observer', 'piece', 'crap.It', 'difficult', 'have', 'sympathy', 'characters', 'here', 'one', 'real', 'connections', 'other', 'film', 'along', 'much', 'three', 'semi-connected', 'nightmare', 'dreams', 'sequences', 'involving', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'road', 'nowhere', 'A', 'much', 'better', 'choice', 'terms', 'subject', 'matter', 'here', 'would', 'be', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'Heat', 'Skin', 'Bone', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'Would', 'like', 'see', 'Everett', 'Lewis', 'today', 'see', 'what', 'could', 'come', 'later', 'films', 'are', 'much', 'better']",Skin & Bone
