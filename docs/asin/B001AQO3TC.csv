Please, please continue this series.  Anyone who is a fan of Dick Van Dyke and Mysteries will be lined anxiously awaiting the next installment of this series.  Wednesday, June 06, 2012......Matlock, Father Dowling Mysteries, Murder She Wrote ....  All have most or all seasons on DVD but not Diagnosis Murder.  WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE HERE??!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  They are releasing some great shows but someone (or some people) are biased against the DIAGNOIS MURDER series.  Why are we being made to suffer when they are releasing all kinds of stuff to DVD?  They are dropping out B grade horror movies, all kinds of westerns, made for TV Movies and (of course) DIRECT TO VIDEO (DVD).  What is the deal here???!!!!  WE need to all send a letter to the CBS offices and start demanding they get of their collective butts and get these out.  This was an awesome series and I don't want to see it lost in limbo never to be finished on DVD. It's all great that they are putting this on the web via HULU or whatever service, but being an old-fashioned person I really want the movies so I can kick back on the couch and plug them to watch over and over and over...

Please Amazon, if you have any clout with Paramount TV, get them to release the rest of the Diagnosis Murder series. I couldn't find how to sign up to be notified of any new DM DVDs so I thought I'd just write this review in the hopes that someone at Amazon will see it and realize we DM fans just want the rest of our show on DVD. Pretty much everything else I like is already making good progress on DVDs such as House, Bones, and some of the newer ones.
