Just a quick pseudo-similarity versus a long list of what makes each series.  Sekirei is a hard act to follow for any title in my opinion.  Here, the formula is used to a small degree but that's where it ends.Like many other viewers have said, yes it's 'harem', 'comedy' & 'action' w/ a bit of drama as well.  It's also a hefty handful of some bad ass (not to mention GORGEOUS) chicks...plus the token smart guy who sort'a holds them together (and who likes them all very much regardless of some of the goings on (you'll see what I mean there when you watch) but he is truly *IN LOVE* w/ only one. Also of course she cannot reciprocate while another is wholly in love with him and comically throws herself at him...CONSTANTLY!  I laughed so hard at nearly every ""attempt"" she makes I had to pause so I could continue listening to the scenes!  (SPECIAL NOTE: Monica Rial plays this role so well they simply couldn't have cast it better in my opinion...and while she is not my personal favorite, I DO love her quite a bit...but a few others are simply more fun and better most of the time to me...but in this particular case/role, she stole the show several times for me and had me pausing, rewinding, etc to laugh again & again &again;!)Nevertheless, the characters all mesh incredibly well.  The VA's are beyond wonderful choices!!!!  The cast is so superb it may be one of the best features overall!  Still, it's a solid story w/ solid humor and some WONDERFUL fighting.  I disagree w/ those who felt the fighting got boring at times...I wasn't bored in the least.  However, I also wholly respect that opinions vary and we all like what we like. All titles aren't the same - thankfully, right?!?!!!  :-)  And we all have the right to like, enjoy, etc - or not - all that we watch.I believe this is a great addition to anyone's collection if you're a fan of the harem, comedy and/or action genres.  It's a good blend of all three and it works very well without getting dull AND without overusing any single part from the proverbial ""pro"" column.  The ""cons"" are so minimal at best and easily overlooked while enjoying the rest.  I bought Majikoi: Oh! Samurai Girl sight unseen - no trailers, reviews or anything save for the initial synopsis...and I've watched it 3 times since the date it hit the streets and loved it every time!!

1569734,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B008KZX8R4,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 3]","The Japanese adult visual novel known as ""Maji de Watashi ni Koi Shinasai!"" has its fair share of fans in Japan.Created by Minato Soft for the PC back in 2009, a manga adaptation for Comp Ace would follow in 2010 which eventually led to a 12-episode anime series in 2011. And now, ""Majikoi - Oh! Samurai Girls: Complete Collection"" was released on Blu-ray courtesy of Sentai Filmworks in October 2012.VIDEO:""Majikoi - Oh! Samurai Girls: Complete Collection"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ratio).  While the series is vibrant and colorful, backgrounds are well-detailed and for the most part, the anime series looks good.  As a TV series, there is some softness but overall, the series compliments the visual novel counterpart when it comes to close-ups of the characters.  There is nothing groundbreaking when it comes to the animation but overall, it does look good on Blu-ray and I didn't notice any artifacts or any major problems while watching the anime series.AUDIO:""Majikoi - Oh! Samurai Girls: Complete Collection"" is presented in English DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 and Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0. Although I would have preferred to have a more immersive 5.1 lossless soundtrack, ""Majikoi - Oh! Samurai Girls: Complete Collection"" and its two soundtracks are crystal clear coming through the front channel and there is no difference between the overall mix of both lossless soundtracks.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Majikoi - Oh! Samurai Girls: Complete Collection"" comes with the following special features:12 Shorts - The omake shorts (12 total) that typically appear at the end of an episode are featured as a special feature.Clean Opening and Closing AnimationJUDGMENT CALL:""Majikoi - Oh! Samurai Girls"" is another anime series that exemplifies what a harem anime series can be.  With its cover featuring one of the lead protagonist grabbing the antagonist's breast with one hand and her hands on her rival's rear, already, anime fans know that this anime series is going to be perverted.For fans of the ecchi anime series genre, it's all about how far the anime series will go with its all-out perverseness.Comparable to series such as ""Sekirei"" and also other harem anime series which features a protagonist with many female friends who want to be with him and also a series that is based on a adult visual novel, ""Majikoi! -Oh! Samurai Girls"" starts out being a different type of anime series by showcasing a group using strategy to defeat another fighting club, something we see similar to another series ""Tenjo Tenge"".But while that first episode was trying to establish the characters who are a group of friends now having certain power at their high school because they beat a stellar and wealthy team, the series then changes.What we end up getting is how the protagonist Yamato becomes the man that each female character desires.Momoyo is the woman that Yamato grew up with liking, but because he made a promise to her that he won't be with her unless he can be of equal footing, both try to have this brother and sister relationship.So, the other ladies look at Yamato as open season.  Momoi's adoptive younger sister Kazuyo always knew that Momoyo liked Yamato, but because she doesn't show her feelings of love, she decides to go for Yamato.Miyako on the other hand is the most aggressive of the young women.  She was saved by Yamato when picked on by bullies and she desperately wants Yamato to have her body and will do anything sexual for him, but he resists.Yukie is the shy type that likes Yamato but is not good at expressing her emotions, while the German Christian Friedrich doesn't know too much about Japanese culture and but the fact that Yamato is a great strategist and he was good at nearly getting her to expose herself nude to him, makes her appreciate him more.And of course, there are Yamato's male buddies who had a major part in the beginning of the series but not so much throughout.  The series pretty much plays out of how these young women start to follow for Yamato and each wanting to vouch for their love for him, but jealousy developing within each member of who can win Yamato's love.And for the anime series, the perversion level for ""Majikoi - Oh! Samurai Girls"" is quite high!  Momoyo loves to squeeze Yamato, but because she is so well-endowed, you are not sure if he's loving it or if he's really hurting.  Miyako is the ultimate in perversion as she has dreams of Yamato having sex with her and even so far as being blunt to Yamato of what she wants him to do with her body.And as one can expect from a perverted harem anime series, you get your T&A; and other forms of fan service. It's important to note that this anime series is rated TV 14 VSD, which is quite surprising as I was expecting a rated TV M because of the nudity and sexual themes in certain episodes, especially the ending credits.But with the characters being fighters who specialize in one-on-one combat and utilization of weaponry, the series has its fair share of action as well.  Actually, a lot of action and while there are antagonists, it may seem that most of the action take place within the core group as each woman fights for Yamato's affection.As for the Blu-ray release, the animation is quite vibrant.  For the most part, animation is vibrant as greens and Earth colors really are quite vibrant and certain areas are well-detailed.  Character animation are also good but as one expects from a TV series, some areas do look soft.  Audio is presented in lossless 2.0 but you get an English and Japanese soundtrack and dialogue is crystal clear and there isn't too much of a big difference between the Japanese and English soundtrack in dynamic range.  And you also get several special features, which are the omake portion at the end of an episode.Overall, ""Majikoi - Oh! Samurai Girls: Complete Collection"" is an anime series that doesn't really break any new ground. It has a banality of other harem action anime series but it's strength lies within its fan service and because there is a niche of anime fandom that just adores perverted anime, it all comes down if you want more of it on Blu-ray.  So, if you are into perverted anime series with nudity, fan service and mature jokes, then ""Majikoi - Oh! Samurai Girls: Complete Collection"" is for you!",3,"A series with interesting forms of combat and strategy but also a lot of T&A, perverse humor and fan service.",1354233600,"11 30,

I struggled through this series hoping I might find something that is redeeming for this anime.  I don't mind Fan Service (Some times I expect it as I did with this Anime)BUT it let its very simple story go.This is a Comedy (I found it to be such) with very little ""Action"" as one may expect from this series.The story is simple enough and is border line love story.  All this is achieved through comical and boring means. Yes you have seen this type of story before perhaps with less fan service.As with a few anime out there this one had it's writing and story quickly disappear it was as if Director lost interest in the story and decided fan service was the way to go.I am not going to spoil a lot of details so bottom line, This is NOT for children this Anime has Nudity and Adult Humor with a little violence.  I strongly recommend you view a few episodes online before you decide to buy this anime.As always this is my own opinion you may or may not agree I guess you would have to watch it to see what I speak of so in a small way I recommend to view a few episodes online before you buy.",2,A Anime for Fan service only,1359158400,"01 26, 2013",2013,1151,"['title', 'Anime', 'fan', 'service', 'struggled', 'series', 'hoping', 'might', 'find', 'something', 'redeeming', 'anime', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'Fan', 'Service', 'times', 'expect', 'did', 'Anime', 'BUT', 'let', 'very', 'simple', 'story', 'go.This', 'Comedy', 'found', 'be', 'such', 'very', 'little', 'Action', 'one', 'may', 'expect', 'series.The', 'story', 'simple', 'enough', 'border', 'line', 'story', 'achieved', 'comical', 'boring', 'means', 'Yes', 'have', 'seen', 'type', 'story', 'perhaps', 'less', 'fan', 'service.As', 'few', 'anime', 'there', 'one', 'had', 'writing', 'story', 'quickly', 'disappear', 'was', 'Director', 'lost', 'interest', 'story', 'decided', 'fan', 'service', 'was', 'way', 'go.I', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'spoil', 'lot', 'details', 'so', 'bottom', 'line', 'NOT', 'children', 'Anime', 'Nudity', 'Adult', 'Humor', 'little', 'violence', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'view', 'few', 'episodes', 'online', 'decide', 'buy', 'anime.As', 'always', 'own', 'opinion', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'agree', 'guess', 'would', 'have', 'watch', 'see', 'what', 'speak', 'so', 'small', 'way', 'recommend', 'view', 'few', 'episodes', 'online', 'buy']",N/A

That ranking spills over into the school system. Local kids like Yamato Naoe have learned to form groups to deal with this reality. The balance of sexual tension was even in his circle of friends with 3 girls and 4 boys. That is until 2 more chicks started spinning everything out of control. Yamato lives with 5 hotties that all want him bad, that is all except the one he loves. Things are about to get interesting and very dangerous! The country is in political turmoil. The Prime Minister uses his power to gain even more power, by any means necessary. There are many in Japan who despise this. Including Yamato's father, who abandoned his country because of the corruption. Yamato, however, decides that he will fight against it for the people he loves.This anime starts off kinda seeming thoughtless. It's definitely a harem anime, and there is lots of nudity and racey stuff. Despite all of this, a plot develops. There is a fairly decent love story, nothing like Clannad or Marmalade Boy, but a decent one nonetheless. This anime also has some very meaningful political and moral lessons to teach. Is it better to abandon your country because it's leaders are ruining it, or should you be loyal and remove the corruption. This is a very important topic, especially considering America's current political situation. Anyway, This anime also has great production quality. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are excellent. There is a great mix of comedy, action, drama, and fan service. It's not the best anime series out there, but it's pretty entertaining.

The basis is you have a group of young high school friends most who are very talented martial arts or weapons fighters and again like with most harem animes most of the females all have a hidden or not so hidden feelings for the main male character of the series.  Though what separates this series a little from the previous mentioned ones is that for the most part many of the characters have endearing original quirky personalities that seem to set them apart from some of the more usual harem animes. Also while there is actions and some drama in the series for most of it the setting is pretty light hearted as you see the rivalry between school classes, different schools and people think of it as a little updated Ranma1/2 subplot.While the extras aren't the greatest they are still good especially the short comedic specials.  The actors and actresses for the Japanese subbed did a great job in their character roles and kudos to the English cast as well. The set is a little pricey but if you've seen some of the series online or like harem animes with hardcore female fighters with quirky traits then here's a decent one to add to your anime library.",5,While A Generic Fem Fatale Harem Anime The Story And Characters More Then Keep You Entertained,1351728000,"11 1, 2012",2012,1430,"['other', 'past', 'series', 'similar', 'Ikki', 'Tossen/Samurai', 'Girls/Tenjho', 'Tenge/Freezing/Sekirei', 'series', 'bevy', 'hard', 'core', 'fighting', 'most', 'females', 'well', 'endowed', 'characters', 'own', 'quirky', 'personalities', 'quickly', 'endear', 'basis', 'have', 'group', 'young', 'high', 'school', 'friends', 'most', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'talented', 'martial', 'arts', 'weapons', 'fighters', 'again', 'most', 'harem', 'animes', 'most', 'females', 'have', 'hidden', 'not', 'so', 'hidden', 'feelings', 'main', 'male', 'character', 'series', 'what', 'series', 'little', 'previous', 'mentioned', 'ones', 'most', 'part', 'many', 'characters', 'have', 'endearing', 'original', 'quirky', 'personalities', 'seem', 'set', 'apart', 'more', 'usual', 'harem', 'animes', 'Also', 'actions', 'drama', 'series', 'most', 'setting', 'pretty', 'light', 'hearted', 'see', 'rivalry', 'school', 'classes', 'different', 'schools', 'people', 'think', 'little', 'updated', 'Ranma1/2', 'subplot.While', 'extras', 'are', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'are', 'still', 'good', 'especially', 'short', 'comedic', 'specials', 'actors', 'actresses', 'Japanese', 'subbed', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'character', 'roles', 'kudos', 'English', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'set', 'little', 'pricey', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'series', 'online', 'harem', 'animes', 'hardcore', 'female', 'fighters', 'quirky', 'traits', 'then', 'here', 'decent', 'one', 'add', 'anime', 'library']",N/A
