374314,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,630343102X,Acute Observer,"[0, 1]","The Tanks Are Coming, 1951 filmThis is the story of tanks and tankers. It is set in July 1944 when the ""iron buggies"" were going into action against the enemy. The order is given, they roll out. They stop when an anti-tank rocket is fired at one tank. An HE shell brushes them away. A Panther tank is a more difficult opponent, their 75mm shells bounce off its armor! The Panther's cannon stops the American tanks. But another Sherman tank fires at its more vulnerable rear! The wounded Sergeant is replaced. Staff Sergeant Sullivan is the new leader of the replacement tank. He makes his own luck and doesn't want people who make mistakes. They advance up to 90 miles a day until a destroyed bridge stops them. They find a place where they can ford the river.An enemy machine gun fires at them until their cannon replies. But there is another bigger cannon behind them! There is a duel, the Sherman tank triumphs. Sgt. Sullivan is all business, and explains his actions to the lieutenant. The more powerful 88mm cannon out-shoots their 75mm cannon, they have 5"" of armor against their 3"" or armor. There is an incident in the night when a strange jeep drives down the road. ""Don't challenge it from the open!"" [Some people don't like good advice.] A captured enemy officer provides information to the Americans. A burnt-out tank will be used for a road block. Sgt. Sullivan searches for his dispersed crew in town. The Germans are retreating. An observer sees enemy soldiers advancing and reports it. American cannon drop shells. After this the enemy soldiers surrender. Then more surrendered soldiers arrive, driven by Sgt. Sullivan. ""What a guy!"" The observer is recommended for a Silver Star. The latest American tank arrives for Pfc. Ike, it has a 90mm gun.The American army approached the Siegfried Line. Engineers are sent forward to destroy the obstacles. They are shelled. Sullivan tries to drive over the ""teeth"". The new American tanks are superior to their enemy. Sgt. Sullivan pushes dirt over those ""teeth"" to provide a bridge for the other tanks. Heinrich meets his grandparents! Sullivan meets a stray dog. Later he is offered a promotion to lieutenant (and a transfer). They wind them up and roll them out.This story is both a drama and a lesson in proper behavior. Sgt. Sullivan is a man who makes his own luck by being careful and cautious. These lessons are woven into the story. But these scenes may only be the highlights of actual events. Parts seem to be like a training film. It would have been helpful to have some information about the armored vehicles used in this movie. This came from a story by Samuel Fuller, army veteran, movie director, writer, and actor (""The Return to Salem's Lot""). I think Harry Brown's ""A Walk in the Sun"" or ""The Sands of Iwo Jima"" were better stories about the war. I wonder how many would appreciate a monochrome movie about WW II after seventy years?",4,The Tank Corps in Action,1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,2910,"['Tanks', 'Are', 'Coming', '1951', 'filmThis', 'story', 'tanks', 'tankers', 'set', 'July', '1944', 'when', 'iron', 'buggies', 'were', 'going', 'action', 'enemy', 'order', 'given', 'roll', 'out', 'stop', 'when', 'anti-tank', 'rocket', 'fired', 'one', 'tank', 'HE', 'shell', 'away', 'Panther', 'tank', 'more', 'difficult', 'opponent', '75mm', 'shells', 'bounce', 'off', 'armor', 'Panther', 'cannon', 'American', 'tanks', 'Sherman', 'tank', 'fires', 'more', 'vulnerable', 'rear', 'wounded', 'Sergeant', 'replaced', 'Staff', 'Sergeant', 'Sullivan', 'new', 'leader', 'replacement', 'tank', 'own', 'luck', ""n't"", 'want', 'people', 'who', 'make', 'mistakes', 'advance', 'up', '90', 'miles', 'day', 'destroyed', 'bridge', 'find', 'place', 'where', 'can', 'ford', 'river.An', 'enemy', 'machine', 'gun', 'fires', 'cannon', 'replies', 'bigger', 'cannon', 'duel', 'Sherman', 'tank', 'triumphs', 'Sgt', 'Sullivan', 'business', 'actions', 'lieutenant', 'more', 'powerful', '88mm', 'cannon', 'out-shoots', '75mm', 'cannon', 'have', '5', 'armor', '3', 'armor', 'incident', 'night', 'when', 'strange', 'jeep', 'drives', 'down', 'road', 'Do', ""n't"", 'challenge', 'open', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'good', 'advice', ']', 'captured', 'enemy', 'officer', 'information', 'Americans', 'burnt-out', 'tank', 'will', 'be', 'used', 'road', 'block', 'Sgt', 'Sullivan', 'dispersed', 'crew', 'town', 'Germans', 'are', 'retreating', 'observer', 'enemy', 'soldiers', 'advancing', 'reports', 'American', 'cannon', 'drop', 'shells', 'enemy', 'soldiers', 'surrender', 'Then', 'more', 'surrendered', 'soldiers', 'arrive', 'driven', 'Sgt', 'Sullivan', 'What', 'guy', 'observer', 'recommended', 'Silver', 'Star', 'latest', 'American', 'tank', 'Pfc', 'Ike', '90mm', 'gun.The', 'American', 'army', 'approached', 'Siegfried', 'Line', 'Engineers', 'are', 'sent', 'forward', 'destroy', 'obstacles', 'are', 'shelled', 'Sullivan', 'drive', 'teeth', 'new', 'American', 'tanks', 'are', 'superior', 'enemy', 'Sgt', 'Sullivan', 'dirt', 'teeth', 'provide', 'bridge', 'other', 'tanks', 'Heinrich', 'grandparents', 'Sullivan', 'stray', 'dog', 'Later', 'offered', 'promotion', 'lieutenant', 'transfer', 'wind', 'up', 'roll', 'out.This', 'story', 'drama', 'lesson', 'proper', 'behavior', 'Sgt', 'Sullivan', 'man', 'who', 'own', 'luck', 'being', 'careful', 'cautious', 'lessons', 'are', 'woven', 'story', 'scenes', 'may', 'only', 'be', 'highlights', 'actual', 'events', 'Parts', 'seem', 'be', 'training', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'helpful', 'have', 'information', 'armored', 'vehicles', 'used', 'movie', 'came', 'story', 'Samuel', 'Fuller', 'army', 'veteran', 'movie', 'director', 'writer', 'actor', 'Return', 'Salem', 'Lot', 'think', 'Harry', 'Brown', 'Walk', 'Sun', 'Sands', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'were', 'better', 'stories', 'war', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'would', 'appreciate', 'monochrome', 'movie', 'WW', 'II', 'seventy', 'years']",The Tanks Are Coming VHS

This occurs on three different DVD play devices. I haven't contacted Amazon yet about exchange but two other movies that are 'instant copies' play fine as does most of this one.As for the movie, it is historically inaccurate as far as timeline goes. The Pershing was not deployed in Europe until Feb/March 1945. It would have saved a lot of tankers lives if it had been available in the fall of 1944. They keep referring to the German Panther tank as having an '88'. The Panther had a high velocity 75mm main gun which was quite capable of defeating the Sherman's armor at most combat ranges.The plusses for the movie are that they made it when real Sherman tanks were available! All the Sherman's in the main scenes are 75mm gun models and are probably M4A3s with the Ford GAA engine. The background images in the title sequence show M4A3E8s with 76mm guns which didn't show up until mid to late 1944.Since there weren't any running German tanks available, WWII U.S. Tank Destroyers were used as stand-ins.All in all, an entertaining movie and a boon to fans of the Sherman tank.",4,Problem disk,1304294400,"05 2, 2011",2011,1194,"['disk', 'problem', 'playback', 'own', 'approximately', 'same', 'place', 'movie', 'three', 'different', 'DVD', 'play', 'devices', 'have', ""n't"", 'contacted', 'Amazon', 'yet', 'exchange', 'two', 'other', 'movies', 'are', ""'instant"", 'copies', 'play', 'fine', 'most', 'one.As', 'movie', 'historically', 'inaccurate', 'as', 'far', 'timeline', 'Pershing', 'was', 'not', 'deployed', 'Europe', 'Feb/March', '1945', 'would', 'have', 'saved', 'lot', 'tankers', 'lives', 'had', 'been', 'available', 'fall', '1944', 'keep', 'referring', 'German', 'Panther', 'tank', 'having', ""'88"", 'Panther', 'had', 'high', 'velocity', '75mm', 'main', 'gun', 'was', 'quite', 'capable', 'defeating', 'Sherman', 'armor', 'most', 'combat', 'ranges.The', 'plusses', 'movie', 'are', 'made', 'when', 'real', 'Sherman', 'tanks', 'were', 'available', 'Sherman', 'main', 'scenes', 'are', '75mm', 'gun', 'models', 'are', 'probably', 'M4A3s', 'Ford', 'GAA', 'engine', 'background', 'title', 'sequence', 'show', 'M4A3E8s', '76mm', 'guns', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'mid', 'late', '1944.Since', 'were', ""n't"", 'running', 'German', 'tanks', 'available', 'WWII', 'U.S', 'Tank', 'Destroyers', 'were', 'used', 'stand-ins.All', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'boon', 'fans', 'Sherman', 'tank']",The Tanks Are Coming VHS

But that was standard for this time frame in filmaking. What wasn't; was the basic realism in approach and storyline. They used alot of Sherman tanks in this movie and did a fantastic job here. The movie just deals with a platoon of tanks as they struggle to keep alive accross France during the conflict. IT's well acted and even the story of the driven tank sergeant who mercilessly pushes his men to be the best AND Stay alive is a good one. There were certainly men like him in any conflict. This is a black and white movie but it doesn't hurt it in the least , although the fact that this is only on dvdr is strange.
