206427,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,6300186008,Gregor von Kallahann,"[3, 15]","It's actually kind hard to understand--at this point in r'n'r  history--that the Doors were thought of as being ""theatrical"" in their day.  I mean, in the late '60s we had light shows and all, but the real rock extravaganzas didn't really get off the ground until the mid-70s (with KISS and their ilk, although I guess you can create a case for people like Alice Cooper a bit earlier than that).  The only little acting bit in this concert performance is a brief moment in ""Unknown Soldier"" when Robbie Krieger uses his guitar as a gun, and standing in for an entire firing squad, shoots Jim Morrison dead (well, dead for about 30 seconds, but then he's back to life with all his glowering intensity).Not exactly elaborate staging, but effective enough.  Morrison's affect had less to do with frenzied stage movement than with his sullen, sneering stance.  Actually, his footwork--such as it is--is pretty stiff and uninspired. He's not Prince; not even Iggy Pop. The ""dance on fire"" bit was mostly in his head.  And in yours.  At the time, that seemed enough.There has been a lot of revisionist criticism of the Doors.  Lots of people who were taken in by all the Lizard King jive are embarrassed about their youthful enthusiasm for Morrison's brand of rock shamanism now.  But this performance video shows that the group WAS tight and that Morrison did have a commanding presence and a solid if limited vocal delivery. For a brief moment, they were on to something.  It wasn't the revolution--but maybe it wasn't such bad theater after all.",4,"""Dance On Fire""?",1024876800,"06 24, 2002",2002,1542,"['actually', 'kind', 'hard', 'understand', 'point', 'r', 'n', 'r', 'history', 'Doors', 'were', 'thought', 'being', 'theatrical', 'day', 'mean', 'late', ""'60s"", 'had', 'light', 'shows', 'real', 'rock', 'extravaganzas', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'off', 'ground', 'mid-70s', 'KISS', 'ilk', 'guess', 'can', 'create', 'case', 'people', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'bit', 'earlier', 'only', 'little', 'acting', 'bit', 'concert', 'performance', 'brief', 'moment', 'Unknown', 'Soldier', 'when', 'Robbie', 'Krieger', 'guitar', 'gun', 'standing', 'entire', 'firing', 'squad', 'shoots', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'dead', 'well', 'dead', 'about', '30', 'seconds', 'then', 'back', 'life', 'glowering', 'intensity', 'exactly', 'elaborate', 'staging', 'effective', 'enough', 'Morrison', 'affect', 'had', 'less', 'do', 'frenzied', 'stage', 'movement', 'sullen', 'sneering', 'stance', 'Actually', 'footwork', 'such', 'pretty', 'stiff', 'uninspired', 'not', 'Prince', 'not', 'even', 'Iggy', 'Pop', 'dance', 'fire', 'bit', 'was', 'mostly', 'head', 'yours', 'time', 'seemed', 'enough.There', 'been', 'lot', 'revisionist', 'criticism', 'Doors', 'Lots', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'taken', 'Lizard', 'King', 'jive', 'are', 'embarrassed', 'youthful', 'enthusiasm', 'Morrison', 'brand', 'rock', 'shamanism', 'now', 'performance', 'video', 'group', 'WAS', 'tight', 'Morrison', 'did', 'have', 'commanding', 'presence', 'solid', 'limited', 'vocal', 'delivery', 'brief', 'moment', 'were', 'something', 'was', ""n't"", 'revolution', 'maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'such', 'bad', 'theater']",N/A

It seemed to me that he didhis performance under the influence of drugs or alcohol. His movements were slow and not defined. He spent a lot of time wandering in a fog around the stage, not really getting anywhere, trying to light a cigarette, bending over with his rear to the audience, then leaping in the air, screaming into the microphone. I read he was going to ""dump"" his musicians which would have been a poor decision on his part. Sorry he died so young but the excessive use of drugs and alcohol will shorten the lifespan. I think he would have had a great career if he would have cleaned his act up. My four stars are for the musicians who kept the performance moving.",4,The Doors-Live at the Hollywood Bowl,1096761600,"10 3, 2004",2004,780,"['watched', 'video', 'twice', 'came', 'conclusion', 'Jim', 'Morrisonwas', 'backed', 'up', 'excellent', 'musicians', 'seemed', 'performance', 'influence', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'movements', 'were', 'slow', 'not', 'defined', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'wandering', 'fog', 'stage', 'not', 'really', 'getting', 'anywhere', 'trying', 'light', 'cigarette', 'bending', 'over', 'rear', 'audience', 'then', 'leaping', 'air', 'screaming', 'microphone', 'read', 'was', 'going', 'dump', 'musicians', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'poor', 'decision', 'part', 'Sorry', 'died', 'so', 'young', 'excessive', 'use', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'will', 'shorten', 'lifespan', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'great', 'career', 'would', 'have', 'cleaned', 'act', 'up', 'four', 'stars', 'are', 'musicians', 'who', 'kept', 'performance', 'moving']",N/A
206431,A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ,6300186008,Robert Blake,"[7, 9]","This is one of the best Doors performances ever caught on film. It is the only COMPLETE filmed concert of theirs and shows Jim Morrison at his poetic, comic and visceral best. It also shows how The Doors were great in the intricate compositions of their sound and how they were also a great band because Morrison apparently had an idea of how to make a performance visually interesting in his movements, acting and singing. The performances of &quot;When The Music's Over,&quot; &quot;Light My Fire&quot; and especially &quot;The End,&quot; show the talent these guys really had. Morrison sings the lyrics with intensity and the sense of their poetic worth. &quot;Moonlight Drive&quot; and &quot;Five To One&quot; (which is connected in medley with &quot;Backdoor Man&quot;) are especially well-performed. There is also a curious entertained feeling when Morrison begins reciting weird, but effective pieces of poetry. This is evident in the original execution of &quot;The End,&quot; where Morrison begins improvising (I think), adding new words instead of the typical lyrics you hear in the album version. The band is also plays incredibly well. Ray Manzarek's organ is haunting at times and the drumming of John Densmore and guitar playing of Robby Krieger are sub-par. This is an entertaining, well-done performance by a great band.",5,A Cool Concert.,987206400,"04 14, 2001",2001,1336,"['one', 'best', 'Doors', 'ever', 'caught', 'film', 'only', 'COMPLETE', 'filmed', 'concert', 'theirs', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'poetic', 'comic', 'visceral', 'best', 'also', 'how', 'Doors', 'were', 'great', 'intricate', 'compositions', 'sound', 'how', 'were', 'also', 'great', 'band', 'Morrison', 'apparently', 'had', 'idea', 'how', 'make', 'performance', 'visually', 'interesting', 'movements', 'acting', 'singing', 'performances', 'quot', 'When', 'Music', 'Over', 'quot', 'quot', 'Light', 'My', 'Fire', 'quot', 'especially', 'quot', 'End', 'quot', 'show', 'talent', 'guys', 'really', 'had', 'Morrison', 'lyrics', 'intensity', 'sense', 'poetic', 'worth', 'quot', 'Moonlight', 'Drive', 'quot', 'quot', 'Five', 'One', 'quot', 'connected', 'medley', 'quot', 'Backdoor', 'Man', 'quot', 'are', 'especially', 'well-performed', 'also', 'curious', 'entertained', 'feeling', 'when', 'Morrison', 'reciting', 'weird', 'effective', 'pieces', 'poetry', 'evident', 'original', 'execution', 'quot', 'End', 'quot', 'where', 'Morrison', 'improvising', 'think', 'adding', 'new', 'words', 'instead', 'typical', 'lyrics', 'hear', 'album', 'version', 'band', 'also', 'incredibly', 'well', 'Ray', 'Manzarek', 'organ', 'haunting', 'times', 'drumming', 'John', 'Densmore', 'guitar', 'playing', 'Robby', 'Krieger', 'are', 'sub-par', 'entertaining', 'well-done', 'performance', 'great', 'band']",N/A
