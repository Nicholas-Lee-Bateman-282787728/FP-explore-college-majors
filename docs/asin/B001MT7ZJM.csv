1217524,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B001MT7ZJM,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[5, 5]","The ""Goosebumps"" collection of DVDs have been big hits with my 3 children, and ""Return of the Mummy"" contains 3 scary episodes.In episode 1, Gabe visits his uncle and cousin in Egypt.  Gabe's uncle has been working on an archaeological dig and has uncovered the tomb of a mummified prince.  But, the mummy doesn't like being disturbed and he's soon chasing after Gabe and his family.In episode 2, Jeff Carter's dad has sent a sarcophagus to their home.  Plus, Jeff's sister Kim has a nasty habit of scaring him.  Soon, Kim and her friend have Jeff believing that the mummy in their basement will come to life and catch them.  Unfortunately for Jeff and Kim, the mummy DOES come to life!In the final episode, Eddie and his friend Hat are frustrated because a know-it-all girl in their class is showing them up.  They decide to lure her to Muddy Creek and into the waiting arms of the Mud Monsters.  But who will end up getting caught?The Goosebumps series are fun, scary short episodes aimed at children.  They are scary, but usually not enough so as to really frighten the viewer.  My whole family really enjoys this series.  If you want some good, clean scary movies to watch, then check out ""Return of the Mummy"" and others from the Goosebumps collection.",4,Scary Stories From R.L.

It's not scary and it's just a waste of time. If you want real horror try The Evil Dead or Lucio Fulci's sicker than thou horror films. When I was growing up R.L. Stine was probably the most popular author my classmates were into.
