I recall seeing it in the theater and I do not think that I would pay the current prices to see it in the theater at this point.  It has some thrilling parts and also some comedic parts to it but neither is enough to carry the film to the top.Forrest Whitacker was very good in this film and Robin Givens was excellent as the sexy, vixen who entralled, Whitacker's character.  I really did not recall that Gregory Hines had a major role in this film which may say something about him and the script.  All in all, I would watch this movie again but I would not pay eleven or twelve dollars to see it.Bill Duke is a fine director but this is not his best effort.  There is a lot of graphic violence in this film.  Certainly not one for younger people.This movie seems to be a bit like &#34;Cotton Comes to Harlem&#34; but really not as good.  &#34;Cotton Comes to Harlem&#34; is a classic of the genre.",3,A Very Violent Comedy,1366329600,"04 19, 2013",2013,960,"['film', 'certainly', 'not', 'great', 'entertaining', 'recall', 'seeing', 'theater', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'would', 'pay', 'current', 'prices', 'see', 'theater', 'point', 'thrilling', 'parts', 'also', 'comedic', 'parts', 'enough', 'carry', 'film', 'top.Forrest', 'Whitacker', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'Robin', 'Givens', 'was', 'excellent', 'sexy', 'vixen', 'who', 'entralled', 'Whitacker', 'character', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'recall', 'Gregory', 'Hines', 'had', 'major', 'role', 'film', 'may', 'say', 'something', 'script', 'would', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'would', 'not', 'pay', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'dollars', 'see', 'it.Bill', 'Duke', 'fine', 'director', 'not', 'best', 'effort', 'lot', 'graphic', 'violence', 'film', 'Certainly', 'not', 'one', 'younger', 'people.This', 'movie', 'be', 'bit', '34', 'Cotton', 'Comes', 'Harlem', '34', 'really', 'not', 'good', '34', 'Cotton', 'Comes', 'Harlem', '34', 'classic', 'genre']",N/A

744492,A32EVG7Y33H4RJ,B00008L3TG,JazzFeathers,"[3, 3]","Brilliant! This is one of the very few instances where I enjoyed the film as much as the book. And not because the film is very true to the book (which, in any case, it is), but because the film manages to find its own personality.The setting is simply gorgeous. The rendering of Fifties Harlem is sumptuous, very warm in some places, very hard in others (the emotional use of colour is superbly done), with all a crew of characters that even appearing very shortly,  gives a strong impression of the place and the time.The story revolves around a chest of gold. People find it and lose it, people kill and die for it. Deceit is the currency for everyone. Well, for everyone but Jackson, whose candid innocence and unwavering faith in his love and his Imabelle brings some light in what's basically a very dark tale. And this is true even with all the humor and the wit which is indeed in the story. There's violence here, there's bad things happening, but there's tenderness too, and caring, and straightforward humour.The fast pace, the witty dialogues, the honest rendering of human flaws and strength reminded me a lot of the book, even if some of the dynamics are different. Still I enjoyed what's new in the film as much as I enjoyed everything in the book. One of the new ideas I particularly enjoyed is the larger importance of Imabelle character inside the story. She has a larger part, her story starts first and is presented in more detailed, and she comes across as an exceptionally hard-boiled, and still very vulnerable characters. I loved her.I also enjoyed very much the dynamics between the two brothers, Jackson and Goldy. As in the book, Jackson is a hard character to handle because he's so incredibly naf in a world which is just the opposite. In the book this was made believable by the surrealism of many situations. Here, it is made believable by the tight dynamics between the two brothers who are so different, and still so similar. Because even if Jackson is so unbelievably good, and Goldy is so incredibly resourceful and rootless, there's some of the one in the other and vice versa.I enjoyed it from the first to the last minute.",5,"Gritty, witty, brillian!",1323388800,"12 9, 2011",2011,2160,"['Brilliant', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'instances', 'where', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'book', 'not', 'film', 'very', 'true', 'book', 'case', 'film', 'find', 'own', 'personality.The', 'setting', 'simply', 'gorgeous', 'rendering', 'Fifties', 'Harlem', 'sumptuous', 'very', 'warm', 'places', 'very', 'hard', 'others', 'emotional', 'use', 'colour', 'superbly', 'done', 'crew', 'characters', 'even', 'appearing', 'very', 'shortly', 'strong', 'impression', 'place', 'time.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'chest', 'gold', 'People', 'find', 'lose', 'people', 'kill', 'die', 'Deceit', 'currency', 'everyone', 'Well', 'everyone', 'Jackson', 'candid', 'innocence', 'unwavering', 'faith', 'love', 'Imabelle', 'light', 'what', 'basically', 'very', 'dark', 'tale', 'true', 'even', 'humor', 'wit', 'indeed', 'story', 'violence', 'here', 'bad', 'things', 'happening', 'tenderness', 'too', 'caring', 'straightforward', 'humour.The', 'fast', 'pace', 'witty', 'dialogues', 'honest', 'rendering', 'human', 'flaws', 'strength', 'reminded', 'lot', 'book', 'even', 'dynamics', 'are', 'different', 'Still', 'enjoyed', 'what', 'new', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'everything', 'book', 'One', 'new', 'ideas', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'larger', 'importance', 'Imabelle', 'character', 'story', 'larger', 'part', 'story', 'first', 'presented', 'more', 'detailed', 'across', 'exceptionally', 'hard-boiled', 'still', 'very', 'vulnerable', 'characters', 'loved', 'her.I', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'dynamics', 'two', 'brothers', 'Jackson', 'Goldy', 'book', 'Jackson', 'hard', 'character', 'handle', 'so', 'incredibly', 'naf', 'world', 'just', 'opposite', 'book', 'was', 'made', 'believable', 'surrealism', 'many', 'situations', 'Here', 'made', 'believable', 'tight', 'dynamics', 'two', 'brothers', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'still', 'so', 'similar', 'even', 'Jackson', 'so', 'unbelievably', 'good', 'Goldy', 'so', 'incredibly', 'resourceful', 'rootless', 'one', 'other', 'vice', 'versa.I', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'last', 'minute']",N/A

It had an all-star cast and didnt waste them and under the direction of Bill Duke, it succeeded in what it needed to be.The story: Imabelle is a pretty female crook that leaves for Harlem after taking the money with her. She meets up with a naive milksop named Jackson(Forest Whitaker)and uses his naivete' to her advantage. She later ends up falling for him but things get worse when her gang shows up to his apartment.A Rage In Harlem is interesting when its funny and is interesting when its not being funny. Its funny without trying too hard and it captures the 1930s era of Harlem. Plus it has nightclubs where people actually perform(hell, Harlem Nights didnt even have that). Forest Whitaker is good as the naive Jackson and Gregory Hines(RIP) is also good as his cousin Goldy. Robin Givens is great as the gorgeous but deceptive Imabelle. They have a little chemistry with each other even though I could do without the scene where Jackson licks her buns(YUCK!). Too raunchy for my taste. At any rate, A Rage In Harlem is one hell of ride from start to finish and is definitely worth being in your collection. Two thumbs up.Also recommended movies by director Bill Duke: Hoodlum, Sister Act 2 and Deep Cover.",5,Outrageously funny,1229212800,"12 14, 2008",2008,1305,"['Rage', 'Harlem', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'slept-on', 'comedy/action', 'features', 'time', 'had', 'all-star', 'cast', 'didnt', 'waste', 'direction', 'Bill', 'Duke', 'succeeded', 'what', 'needed', 'be.The', 'story', 'Imabelle', 'pretty', 'female', 'crook', 'Harlem', 'taking', 'money', 'up', 'naive', 'milksop', 'named', 'Jackson', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'naivete', 'advantage', 'later', 'up', 'falling', 'things', 'get', 'worse', 'when', 'gang', 'up', 'apartment.A', 'Rage', 'Harlem', 'interesting', 'when', 'funny', 'interesting', 'when', 'not', 'being', 'funny', 'funny', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', '1930s', 'era', 'Harlem', 'nightclubs', 'where', 'people', 'actually', 'perform', 'hell', 'Harlem', 'Nights', 'didnt', 'even', 'have', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'good', 'naive', 'Jackson', 'Gregory', 'Hines', 'RIP', 'also', 'good', 'cousin', 'Goldy', 'Robin', 'Givens', 'great', 'gorgeous', 'deceptive', 'Imabelle', 'have', 'little', 'chemistry', 'other', 'even', 'could', 'do', 'scene', 'where', 'Jackson', 'buns', 'YUCK', 'Too', 'raunchy', 'taste', 'rate', 'Rage', 'Harlem', 'one', 'hell', 'ride', 'start', 'finish', 'definitely', 'worth', 'being', 'collection', 'Two', 'thumbs', 'up.Also', 'recommended', 'movies', 'director', 'Bill', 'Duke', 'Hoodlum', 'Sister', 'Act', '2', 'Deep', 'Cover']",N/A
744496,A2WE24HCTKKM4X,B00008L3TG,"Roy Clark ""rclarknv""","[1, 1]","RAGE IN HARLEM is about the funniest 'caper' movie I've seen. Every character is portrayed in depth and is delightful in their avarice, craftiness, violence, appetites, humanity and a lot more to make a cast of unforgettable quirky people. Even though not all make it through the carnage. Bloody yes, but funny and at times poignant too.The actors are familiar stars, back when abit younger (produced in 1991). But their talent is very evident here, shown through every twist and tumble of the cliff-hangers throughout the film. And the print is fine indeed; along with all production values. Forest Whitaker, Danny Glover, Robin Givens and Gregory Hines all give their all; everything, action, bawdy humor, music, all shine through.If this fine flick does it for you, do try another cross-over classicDevil in A Blue DressBoth are original, high-energy and wonderful productions. In Devil in a Blue Dress, Denzel Washington and Don Cheadle are absolutely brilliant!
