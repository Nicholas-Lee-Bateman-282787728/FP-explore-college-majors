I was shocked (yes...shocked) to find this to be such an amazing and enjoyable movie.  It has thrills, plot, morality, very little violence, and no swear words.  Of course I'd rather watch an adult-themed movie, but when my son picks a G rated movie from our library, I always enjoy it.  My older son (age 11) also thinks this is a great movie.BTW, after watching the movie, I had to see what amazon.com users had to say about it.  You have not disappointed me.

A 16yo kid enters the world race with other fellow speed freaks. They roar all the way through, entering and exiting various dimensions through a vortex that opens whenever they hit 300mph. The race is fast and definitely furious, with lots of explosions tossed in. My son jumped all over the room watching this!

The plot was a little much for him to follow, but he did like watching the cars go for a while.  I'd say his interest waned before half the movie was over.The animation is okay.  It's all computer generated, if you like that kind of stuff.Just as a mom, I thought one of the lines was hilarious:  The main character meets a more ""seasoned"" driver, a guy with a reputation for being ""cool"" and ""radical"", and the main character notes that he ""heard"" that the dude had ""skied down Mount Everest.""

The enigmatic Dr. Tezla, manufacturer of the finest racing vehicles in the world, recruits him, along with more of the world's greatest drivers, to compete in the World Race!The drivers will race down the mysterious Highway 35, an super-track built by an ancient race called the Accelerons. What lies at the end of this race is what Dr. Tezla craves: The Wheel of Power, a source of limitless, clean energy.Five racing teams with 35 total drivers and 35 vehicles compete for mastery of Highway 35, the ultimate raceway that challenges man and machine in an alternate dimension of speed, power and performance.This movie delivers 110 minutes of fun entertainment, with plenty of thrilling moments as well as a positive moral message here and there (that's not delivered too heavy-handed). The movie, while filled with action and adventure, includes virtually no physical violence. It's a great video for children (assuming they like cars!).Artisan did a good job with this DVD. The movie is offered in both full screen and widescreen versions, each sporting a 5.1 Dolby Digital mix. Bonus features are an interactive garage that provides details on the 35 racers and vehicles, as well as six fun music videos. The interactive garage features three ""hidden"" easter eggs, with character/car information for Gelorum, Dr Tezla & Gig, and Zed-36.The adventures of many of these characters is continued in the Hot Wheels Acceleracers series, although with some mixed results.See my reviews of those titles for more details.",5,An exciting Hot Wheels adventure - for all ages!!!,1124496000,"08 20, 2005",2005,1739,"['Vert', 'Wheeler', 'average', 'young', 'adult', 'expert', 'surfer', 'skateborder', 'who', 'just', 'gotten', 'driving', 'license', 'perfect', 'score', 'less', '.When', 'how', 'mysterious', 'car', 'Deora', 'driveway', 'enigmatic', 'Dr.', 'Tezla', 'manufacturer', 'finest', 'racing', 'vehicles', 'world', 'more', 'world', 'greatest', 'drivers', 'compete', 'World', 'Race', 'drivers', 'will', 'race', 'down', 'mysterious', 'Highway', '35', 'super-track', 'built', 'ancient', 'race', 'called', 'Accelerons', 'What', 'end', 'race', 'what', 'Dr.', 'Tezla', 'craves', 'Wheel', 'Power', 'source', 'limitless', 'clean', 'energy.Five', 'racing', 'teams', '35', 'total', 'drivers', '35', 'vehicles', 'compete', 'mastery', 'Highway', '35', 'ultimate', 'raceway', 'man', 'machine', 'alternate', 'dimension', 'speed', 'power', 'performance.This', 'movie', 'delivers', '110', 'minutes', 'fun', 'entertainment', 'plenty', 'thrilling', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'positive', 'moral', 'message', 'here', 'there', 'not', 'delivered', 'too', 'heavy-handed', 'movie', 'filled', 'action', 'adventure', 'virtually', 'physical', 'violence', 'great', 'video', 'children', 'assuming', 'cars', '.Artisan', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'DVD', 'movie', 'offered', 'full', 'screen', 'widescreen', 'versions', 'sporting', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'mix', 'Bonus', 'features', 'are', 'interactive', 'garage', 'details', '35', 'racers', 'vehicles', 'as', 'well', 'six', 'fun', 'music', 'videos', 'interactive', 'garage', 'features', 'three', 'hidden', 'easter', 'eggs', 'character/car', 'information', 'Gelorum', 'Dr', 'Tezla', 'Gig', 'Zed-36.The', 'adventures', 'many', 'characters', 'continued', 'Hot', 'Wheels', 'Acceleracers', 'series', 'mixed', 'results.See', 'reviews', 'titles', 'more', 'details']",Hot Wheels - World Race
