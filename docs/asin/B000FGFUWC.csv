Plus the island unaccountably has sheep, goats, even a dog.  The boys don't do much of anything except climb rocks and recite dumb lines.  It is not credible that Jules Verne could have written anything this bad.  Even the bad-guy bit at the end only lasts ten minutes and is a fizzle.The acting is of the quality of a junior high school play rehearsal--an early rehearsal.  The technical quality is a cut above a home movie, but not by much.  The sound is atrocious.  The movie is 66 minutes long.I can't imagine anyone who would enjoy this movie, not even young children.",2,no redeeming qualities,1156118400,"08 21, 2006",2006,702,"['NOT', 'non-stop', 'edge', 'seat', 'adventure', 'story', 'pedestrian', 'beached', 'ship', 'supplies', 'need', 'island', 'unaccountably', 'sheep', 'goats', 'even', 'dog', 'boys', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'anything', 'climb', 'rocks', 'recite', 'dumb', 'lines', 'not', 'credible', 'Jules', 'Verne', 'could', 'have', 'written', 'anything', 'bad', 'Even', 'bad-guy', 'bit', 'end', 'only', 'ten', 'minutes', 'fizzle.The', 'acting', 'quality', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'play', 'rehearsal', 'early', 'rehearsal', 'technical', 'quality', 'cut', 'home', 'movie', 'not', 'much', 'sound', 'atrocious', 'movie', '66', 'minutes', 'long.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'not', 'even', 'young', 'children']",Boys of Lost Island

989750,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000FGFUWC,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 9]","Australian film ""Boys of Lost Island"" is loosely based on ""Deux ans de vacances"" (Two Years' Vacation), Jules Verne's 1888 novel. I know little about the film itself, but according to IMDb, it was made in 1969 with largely unknown cast.Anyway, probably you know Verne's original story, which is about fifteen boys (and a dog) stranded on an uncharted island. If you are looking for the same kind of adventures as the book, you will be much disappointed with this adaptation, which lacks virtually everything. The poor storytelling, amateurish acting and lack of direction are so visible in the first 10 minutes where the boys' ship is met with a ""storm,"" but actually, the storm is nothing but cheap effects and bad editing. After all, the soulless adaptation looks like an extended episode from some cancelled TV show of the 60s.Well, that's not the worst part of the film, though. As the film begins, it unnecessarily shows us that it is set in modern times when searching the missing boys are much easier than Verne's time. That also means the survival does not look as hard as it should be for these ten boys (they reduced the number to 10), who can easily get food, water and a map, too. The boys dressed in clean shirt look rather cheerful and can do a variety of things. They don't even try to think about how come their ship drifted into the ocean (one of the crucial points of Verne's book).""Boys of Lost Island"" could have been fun with a skillful narrative, which it doesn't have. Some of the memorable episodes from the book are certainly there, but they are done all in an awfully banal way. The boys (indistinguishable from one another) quarrel among themselves and some of them leave the camp, but they come back just in 5 minutes. No political allegory or emotional tension can be seen here.When the boys hear weird noises coming behind the cave's wall, the mystery is soon solved before it manages to make us truly care. Plus, I hate to say this, but none of these boys can show decent acting, which might have helped. As it is, this is really a bad adaptation with  pedestrian direction.",1,Very Poor Adaptation of Jules Verne's Adventure Tale,1196380800,"11 30, 2007",2007,2105,"['Australian', 'film', 'Boys', 'Lost', 'Island', 'loosely', 'based', 'Deux', 'de', 'vacances', 'Two', 'Years', 'Vacation', 'Jules', 'Verne', '1888', 'novel', 'know', 'little', 'film', 'according', 'IMDb', 'was', 'made', '1969', 'largely', 'unknown', 'cast.Anyway', 'probably', 'know', 'Verne', 'original', 'story', 'fifteen', 'boys', 'dog', 'stranded', 'uncharted', 'island', 'are', 'looking', 'same', 'kind', 'adventures', 'book', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'disappointed', 'adaptation', 'virtually', 'everything', 'poor', 'storytelling', 'amateurish', 'acting', 'lack', 'direction', 'are', 'so', 'visible', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'where', 'boys', 'ship', 'met', 'storm', 'actually', 'storm', 'nothing', 'cheap', 'effects', 'bad', 'editing', 'soulless', 'adaptation', 'extended', 'episode', 'cancelled', 'TV', 'show', '60s.Well', 'not', 'worst', 'part', 'film', 'though', 'film', 'unnecessarily', 'set', 'modern', 'times', 'when', 'searching', 'missing', 'boys', 'are', 'much', 'easier', 'Verne', 'time', 'also', 'survival', 'not', 'look', 'as', 'hard', 'should', 'be', 'ten', 'boys', 'reduced', 'number', '10', 'who', 'can', 'easily', 'get', 'food', 'water', 'map', 'too', 'boys', 'dressed', 'clean', 'shirt', 'look', 'rather', 'cheerful', 'can', 'do', 'variety', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'think', 'how', 'come', 'ship', 'drifted', 'ocean', 'one', 'crucial', 'points', 'Verne', 'book', 'Boys', 'Lost', 'Island', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fun', 'skillful', 'narrative', ""n't"", 'have', 'memorable', 'episodes', 'book', 'are', 'certainly', 'there', 'are', 'done', 'awfully', 'banal', 'way', 'boys', 'indistinguishable', 'one', 'quarrel', 'leave', 'camp', 'come', 'back', 'just', '5', 'minutes', 'political', 'allegory', 'emotional', 'tension', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'boys', 'hear', 'weird', 'noises', 'coming', 'cave', 'wall', 'mystery', 'soon', 'solved', 'make', 'truly', 'care', 'hate', 'say', 'none', 'boys', 'can', 'show', 'decent', 'acting', 'might', 'have', 'helped', 'really', 'bad', 'adaptation', 'pedestrian', 'direction']",Boys of Lost Island
