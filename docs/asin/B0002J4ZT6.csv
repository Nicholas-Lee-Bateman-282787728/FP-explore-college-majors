836895,AABUMYAMYWUSS,B0002J4ZT6,Anso,"[2, 10]","This film is a short 41 minutes.  It should have been called ""Why Ashtanga?"".  It does not go deep enough into the discipline of Ashtanga yoga to really want you to practice it.  It is very daunting, the poses are extremely difficult and fast paced. If someone has already been introduced to this style of yoga then this will certainly offer a little more info.  But nothing really informs a viewer as to why one should adopt this style of yoga, especially when there are so many other styles that are just as important and maybe even more appropriate for a new student of the discipline.The most interesting info is that the creator of the style K. Pattabhi Jois has a cult like following.  You can't understand the language he is speaking when he directs the students(several hundred of them) from one pose to the next.  The people interviewed are in such bad lighting, some you can't even see their faces. There is a very strange scene where his students at the end of the session come up to him and kneel before him and kiss his feet.  This is totally strange, but some of them do it willingly while others shake his hand or kiss him on the cheek.  It's fine to revere someone, but he is a man, not a God.His grandson is interesting to watch, being the only one who does the most advanced series of poses.  You could call him a human rubber band, his flexibilty is unbelievabe.  The film was shot during the tragedy of 9/11 and his entire family was there to continue classes and offer prayer to the students who clearly needed something to help them through the moment.I can honestly say I can do without celebrity endorsements for the philosophy.  I could care less that Willem Dafoe or Gweneth Paltrow are followers.  I don't practice yoga because some pretentious celebrity is involved.  I practice because it helps my physical and mental state.  I distrust celebrities who boast about this like it's a fad such as former Catholics who practice Kabballah, or driving hybirds, or adopting children that are constantly photographed in the media.  Nothing these two talked about enlighten the viewer as to why again, one should try Ashtanga yoga.  My suggestion, don't buy this dvd.  Rent it from Netflix.  If you are really interested in trying or extending you knowledge of the Mysore style, take a local class or attend a workshop.  You'll get a great deal more from that than you will from this film.",3,Not the most enlightening intro to the discipline,1190073600,"09 18, 2007",2007,2409,"['film', 'short', '41', 'minutes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'Why', 'Ashtanga', 'not', 'go', 'deep', 'enough', 'discipline', 'Ashtanga', 'yoga', 'really', 'want', 'practice', 'very', 'daunting', 'poses', 'are', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'fast', 'paced', 'someone', 'already', 'been', 'introduced', 'style', 'yoga', 'then', 'will', 'certainly', 'offer', 'little', 'more', 'info', 'nothing', 'really', 'viewer', 'why', 'one', 'should', 'adopt', 'style', 'yoga', 'especially', 'when', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'styles', 'are', 'just', 'important', 'maybe', 'even', 'more', 'appropriate', 'new', 'student', 'discipline.The', 'most', 'interesting', 'info', 'creator', 'style', 'K.', 'Pattabhi', 'Jois', 'cult', 'following', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'language', 'speaking', 'when', 'students', 'several', 'hundred', 'one', 'pose', 'next', 'people', 'interviewed', 'are', 'such', 'bad', 'lighting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'very', 'strange', 'scene', 'where', 'students', 'end', 'session', 'come', 'kneel', 'kiss', 'feet', 'totally', 'strange', 'do', 'willingly', 'others', 'shake', 'hand', 'kiss', 'cheek', 'fine', 'revere', 'someone', 'man', 'not', 'God.His', 'grandson', 'interesting', 'watch', 'being', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'most', 'advanced', 'series', 'poses', 'could', 'call', 'human', 'rubber', 'band', 'flexibilty', 'unbelievabe', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'tragedy', '9/11', 'entire', 'family', 'was', 'there', 'continue', 'classes', 'offer', 'prayer', 'students', 'who', 'clearly', 'needed', 'something', 'help', 'moment.I', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'can', 'do', 'celebrity', 'endorsements', 'philosophy', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Gweneth', 'Paltrow', 'are', 'followers', 'do', ""n't"", 'practice', 'yoga', 'pretentious', 'celebrity', 'involved', 'practice', 'physical', 'mental', 'state', 'distrust', 'celebrities', 'who', 'boast', 'fad', 'such', 'former', 'Catholics', 'who', 'practice', 'Kabballah', 'driving', 'hybirds', 'adopting', 'children', 'are', 'constantly', 'photographed', 'media', 'Nothing', 'two', 'talked', 'viewer', 'why', 'again', 'one', 'should', 'try', 'Ashtanga', 'yoga', 'suggestion', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'dvd', 'Rent', 'Netflix', 'are', 'really', 'interested', 'trying', 'extending', 'knowledge', 'Mysore', 'style', 'take', 'local', 'class', 'attend', 'workshop', ""'ll"", 'get', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'will', 'film']",N/A

Jois was considered to be the founder of the ashtanga branch of yoga.  For those of you who would like to discover the roots of this form of yoga which is considered to be one of the most rigorous; I would highly recommend this DVD.Jois who was in his nineties traveled the world and developed a very loyal group of ashtanga practitioners.  Two of the narrators of this documentary, Willem Defoe and Gwyneth Paltrow are two very seasoned and disciplined followers.  In collaboration with other students of Jois, the ashtanga story is told; how it means 8 limbs and how it is very fast paced and flowing with a series of poses always performed in the same order.In viewing this DVD, I was struck by how serene and peaceful both Jois and his grandson are portrayed (and I might add very patient).  The documentary was made in 2001 so one sees the practices and workshop sessions leading up to 9/11 and how these sessions brought peace and some comfort to the NYC practitioners after that tragic event.This DVD presents a very personal portrait of Sri K Pattabhi Jois and of his devoted follower (his grandson) and successor Sharath Rangaswamy (who is also absolutely amazing) in his own right.  Sharath has taken over the teaching and his grandfather's practice since Jois passed away a few years ago.This is a very moving documentary which helps the viewer become introduced to not only Ashtanga yoga and its health benefits; but also to its founder. The viewer will gain some insight into the core foundation of the yoga form itself and why its practitioners sing its praises.Bentley/2009",5,An Ashtanga Odyssey,1244678400,"06 11, 2009",2009,1704,"['2001', 'Sri', 'K.', 'Pattabhi', 'Jois', 'family', 'traveled', 'NYC', 'offer', 'intense', 'workshops', 'NYC', 'practitioners', 'Jois', 'was', 'considered', 'be', 'founder', 'ashtanga', 'branch', 'yoga', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'discover', 'roots', 'form', 'yoga', 'considered', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'rigorous', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD.Jois', 'who', 'was', 'nineties', 'traveled', 'world', 'developed', 'very', 'loyal', 'group', 'ashtanga', 'practitioners', 'Two', 'narrators', 'documentary', 'Willem', 'Defoe', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'are', 'two', 'very', 'seasoned', 'disciplined', 'followers', 'collaboration', 'other', 'students', 'Jois', 'ashtanga', 'story', 'told', 'how', '8', 'limbs', 'how', 'very', 'fast', 'paced', 'flowing', 'series', 'poses', 'always', 'performed', 'same', 'order.In', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'was', 'struck', 'how', 'serene', 'peaceful', 'Jois', 'grandson', 'are', 'portrayed', 'might', 'add', 'very', 'patient', 'documentary', 'was', 'made', '2001', 'one', 'practices', 'workshop', 'sessions', 'leading', 'up', '9/11', 'how', 'sessions', 'brought', 'peace', 'comfort', 'NYC', 'practitioners', 'tragic', 'event.This', 'DVD', 'very', 'personal', 'portrait', 'Sri', 'K', 'Pattabhi', 'Jois', 'devoted', 'follower', 'grandson', 'successor', 'Sharath', 'Rangaswamy', 'who', 'also', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'own', 'right', 'Sharath', 'taken', 'over', 'teaching', 'grandfather', 'practice', 'Jois', 'passed', 'away', 'few', 'years', 'ago.This', 'very', 'moving', 'documentary', 'viewer', 'become', 'introduced', 'not', 'only', 'Ashtanga', 'yoga', 'health', 'benefits', 'also', 'founder', 'viewer', 'will', 'gain', 'insight', 'core', 'foundation', 'yoga', 'form', 'why', 'practitioners', 'sing', 'praises.Bentley/2009']",N/A

836898,A1S52XH2CS4Y26,B0002J4ZT6,Fitzgerald Fan,"[0, 0]","I just got this (highly anticipated) documentary yesterday and last night I sat down and watched it all the way through. TWICE! There really is something about Ashtanga that makes itself necessary in one's life. As one of the women reviewed in the documentary states (and I paraphrase), ""There is no such thing as going half way with Ashtanga."" You either experience it and get involved, eventually, in all the limbs, or you drop it and decide it is not for you.I am an all or nothing girl, and I feel like this practice is meant for me. It cools me out and reminds me to be introspective. This documentary made me proud of my practice and it really affirmed my choice to stick it out every day...even when it is tough (especially when it is tough).This is in no way an instructional DVD and if you don't already have some knowledge of Ashtanga, you might find it supremely boring...yet, then again, maybe this is just the inspiration you need to discover the practice and how it inspires and changes people.Lastly, what is really poignant about this short film is that is depicts Sri K. Pattabhi Jois' last workshop in the U.S. before his death. Furthermore, this workshop took place right in the middle of 9/11 in New York! So inspiring to see how people stuck with their practice as a means to continue living and to dedicate their energies to the fallen.Love, love, love this doc and would recommend it highly to anyone interested in the workings of (Ashtanga) yoga.

836900,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B0002J4ZT6,Linda Linguvic,"[17, 17]","My daughter Wini who practices Ashtanga yoga gave me this DVD to watch.  She wanted me to understand exactly what it was that has challenged and inspired her so much for the past few years.  Last night I watched the DVD. And I must say that I do now understand.This is a short documentary, only 41 minutes.  And yet, it managed to captivate the essence of what the practice of Ashtanga yoga is.  It was shot in September of 2001, during a period of time that Sri K Pattabhi Jois, the 86-year old Indian yoga teacher affectionately know as Guruji, came to New York to hold a large group class for devotees.  Every day that month, 250 of his followers practiced yoga at dawn under his watchful eye in a huge room at Chelsea piers.  Yes, there were some celebrities there, namely Willem Dafoe, Gwyneth Paltrow and Beastie Boy Mike D, but I only recognized Willem Dafoe who made a comment at the beginning about his need to practice yoga to be able better function in the stimulating atmosphere of New York City.The practice of Ashtanga yoga is intense.  It requires almost daily attendance as well as extremely demanding physical exercises. But whoever practices it seems to come away with a cult-like devotion to it and a feeling of camaraderie with the people who practice it alongside each of them even if they do not know their names or who they are, and a sense of spirituality and well being.During the period of time this documentary was being made, New York experienced the horrible attacks on 9/11.  I remember the feeling of living in New York at the time.  I remember the deep sense of sadness and mourning.  This comes across quite clearly during a ceremony held by the yoga teacher.  And the DVD certainly depicted how the devotees' practice of yoga helped the get through this terrible time.I was fascinated throughout at this very thoughtful and reverent documentary.  And although I knew that my own daughter was not in this particular film, I thought a lot of the yoga students looked a lot like her.  It was probably because all of them had lithe, lean and flexible bodies.Before I saw this film I thought I understood what Ashtanga yoga was about.  But seeing it with my own eyes certainly deepened my own understanding.Recommended.",5,Deepened my understanding of this ancient practice,1115510400,"05 8, 2005",2005,2248,"['daughter', 'Wini', 'who', 'practices', 'Ashtanga', 'yoga', 'gave', 'DVD', 'watch', 'wanted', 'understand', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'challenged', 'inspired', 'so', 'much', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'Last', 'night', 'watched', 'DVD', 'must', 'say', 'do', 'now', 'understand.This', 'short', 'documentary', 'only', '41', 'minutes', 'yet', 'managed', 'captivate', 'essence', 'what', 'practice', 'Ashtanga', 'yoga', 'was', 'shot', 'September', '2001', 'period', 'time', 'Sri', 'K', 'Pattabhi', 'Jois', '86-year', 'old', 'Indian', 'yoga', 'teacher', 'affectionately', 'know', 'Guruji', 'came', 'New', 'York', 'hold', 'large', 'group', 'class', 'devotees', 'day', 'month', '250', 'followers', 'practiced', 'yoga', 'dawn', 'watchful', 'eye', 'huge', 'room', 'Chelsea', 'piers', 'Yes', 'were', 'celebrities', 'there', 'namely', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Beastie', 'Boy', 'Mike', 'D', 'only', 'recognized', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'who', 'made', 'comment', 'beginning', 'need', 'practice', 'yoga', 'be', 'able', 'better', 'function', 'stimulating', 'atmosphere', 'New', 'York', 'City.The', 'practice', 'Ashtanga', 'yoga', 'intense', 'almost', 'daily', 'attendance', 'as', 'well', 'extremely', 'demanding', 'physical', 'exercises', 'whoever', 'practices', 'come', 'away', 'cult-like', 'devotion', 'feeling', 'camaraderie', 'people', 'who', 'practice', 'even', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'names', 'who', 'are', 'sense', 'spirituality', 'well', 'being.During', 'period', 'time', 'documentary', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'New', 'York', 'experienced', 'horrible', 'attacks', '9/11', 'remember', 'feeling', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'time', 'remember', 'deep', 'sense', 'sadness', 'mourning', 'quite', 'clearly', 'ceremony', 'held', 'yoga', 'teacher', 'DVD', 'certainly', 'depicted', 'how', 'devotees', 'practice', 'yoga', 'helped', 'get', 'terrible', 'time.I', 'was', 'fascinated', 'very', 'thoughtful', 'reverent', 'documentary', 'knew', 'own', 'daughter', 'was', 'not', 'particular', 'film', 'thought', 'lot', 'yoga', 'students', 'looked', 'lot', 'was', 'probably', 'had', 'lithe', 'lean', 'flexible', 'bodies.Before', 'saw', 'film', 'thought', 'understood', 'what', 'Ashtanga', 'yoga', 'was', 'about', 'seeing', 'own', 'eyes', 'certainly', 'deepened', 'own', 'understanding.Recommended']",N/A
