Longer too ~2hr 45mins which is something to rival Star Wars.I also managed to see the original movie again a couple of weeks ago (after first seeing it years and years ago). What was most noticable to me were the flashbacks to the past which were so different to what was in the original movie. Ok, I don't mean not using any of the original actors like Heather Locklear or Drew Barrymore (like they would do this kind of movie now anyway) but the way the parents died, for example, was completely different to the way it was portrayed in this movie.It was also sad how John Rainbird had developed his own personal little army which would eventually lead to a gigantic showdown btwn Charlie and the young &quot;gifted&quot; boys. I did however like the young guy who was helping Charlie through the majority of the movie. It's always nice to have someone you can trust who won't just run away when they learn the truth about you - as frightening as that can be. Too bad things didn't go as he or Charlie expected in the end.I think the girl who played Charlie did a pretty good job but it's a bit of a shame that they didn't use the bits from the first movie as the flashback sequences. However, seeing they inserted some extra footage in the flashback scenes that weren't in the original movie it's understandable that they would need to use other actors to play those roles. Of course the special effects - including sound - were much better in this movie. Not surprising since the first movie was done 18 years ago.See it on video if you're curious to see how Charlie turns out.",3,Not that bad...,1048032000,"03 19, 2003",2003,1660,"['Ok', 'watched', 'movie', 'today', 'was', 'actually', 'better', 'expected', 'Longer', 'too', '45mins', 'something', 'rival', 'Star', 'Wars.I', 'also', 'managed', 'see', 'original', 'movie', 'again', 'couple', 'weeks', 'ago', 'first', 'seeing', 'years', 'years', 'ago', 'What', 'was', 'most', 'noticable', 'were', 'flashbacks', 'past', 'were', 'so', 'different', 'what', 'was', 'original', 'movie', 'Ok', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'not', 'using', 'original', 'actors', 'Heather', 'Locklear', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'would', 'do', 'kind', 'movie', 'now', 'anyway', 'way', 'parents', 'died', 'example', 'was', 'completely', 'different', 'way', 'was', 'portrayed', 'movie.It', 'was', 'also', 'sad', 'how', 'John', 'Rainbird', 'had', 'developed', 'own', 'personal', 'little', 'army', 'would', 'eventually', 'lead', 'gigantic', 'showdown', 'btwn', 'Charlie', 'young', 'quot', 'gifted', 'quot', 'boys', 'did', 'however', 'young', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'helping', 'Charlie', 'majority', 'movie', 'always', 'nice', 'have', 'someone', 'can', 'trust', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'just', 'run', 'away', 'when', 'learn', 'truth', 'as', 'frightening', 'can', 'be', 'Too', 'bad', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'Charlie', 'expected', 'end.I', 'think', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'Charlie', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'bit', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'bits', 'first', 'movie', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'However', 'seeing', 'inserted', 'extra', 'footage', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'were', ""n't"", 'original', 'movie', 'understandable', 'would', 'need', 'use', 'other', 'actors', 'play', 'roles', 'course', 'special', 'effects', 'including', 'sound', 'were', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'Not', 'surprising', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'done', '18', 'years', 'ago.See', 'video', ""'re"", 'curious', 'see', 'how', 'Charlie', 'out']",Firestarter 2 - Rekindled

Set ten years after the first film ends, pyrokinetic teen Charlie McGee (Margueritte Moreau) is now working as a librarian and is aiming to get her life back together. But unfortunately for her agents are still pursuing her and she finds herself having to trust one of them (Malcolm McDowell) and a loopy professor (Dennis Hopper- who else?) in order to survive. The story is nothing great, but I won't be spoiling anything if I say there are lots of explosions. Pity the rest of the movie isn't explosive.I found FIRESTARTER 2 to be slow, long and just not very interesting.

I'm just going to focus more on the entertainment factor.Yes, I was a huge Firestarter fan.  I was a bit disappointed in the changes from the past during the flashback pieces... but the main story was still there.  But this is the biggest reason I did not give them five stars... diverting from the real story.However, I did enjoy the entertainment value.  The idea of more children with unique abilities was fun... I wish they had shown more of these children.  A glimpse at Charlie's life as she was all grown up was interesting, as well as other characters from the Lot 6 experiment.The only thing I did not like was the ending... but this is the story of Charlie so it should have been expected.  I'll leave it at that so I don't blow the ending for anybody.  But it somewhat disappointed me.No, this wasn't as good as the original.  Of course, Stephen King wrote it and didn't have a hand in this, so of course it is better.  I wasn't expecting much and was prepared to turn it off it if didn't catch my attention well.  But I was entertained and I watched it to the end.  Overalll, I would say, ""Job well done, Sci-Fi Channel.""Would I recommend it?

One reason why I gave this movie three stars instead of five is because I actually saw the original ""Firestarter"" with Drew Barrymore in the title role, it's just more of the same with someone else in the title role as the firestarter, only ten years later, supposedly.Too bad what she did to hide from this government agency didn't work like she hoped it would.  In the end, ""Big Brother"" always finds people who hide.  Oh well, ten years of peace is better than no peace at all.I hated Malcolm McDowell's character because on the one hand he put his ""prize creation"" aka Charlie McGee on a pedestal, telling the boys at the compound stories about her, then using what he knew about her to coerce her into using her gift of fire.  He had this sick fantasy about Charlie was to compansate for what he couldn't have.  John certainly didn't love her like a man should, but he was jealous of what she and her male helper had. You will have to watch the movie to see what I mean.What really bothered me about the whole scene at the government compound was that the boys McDowell's character was rearing with their ""education"" was bad because they were 'little monsters' in a sense.  A good parental figure would make sure the child understands compassion and consequences.  The boys were not bad. They were just misguided. I don't like that he refuses to use females for his test subjects.  I think just about anyone can become unpredictable when they know something is up.At least Charlie's parents made sure she knew what consequences were.  That scene where her father smacked her because she didn't want to stop the fire in the barn showed he cared about her and the people that may have been in there.  I am glad she didn't fall for any of McDowell's character's tricks.I wouldn't recommend this movie if you are looking for something different.

This movie is not that bad considering that it is a sci-fi channel miniseries style film.  For a movie that does not need to rely on saying things like (beep) or having tones of (sexual intercourse) that most sequels rely on they really pulled off a treat to the eyes.I think the problem that most of my fellow critics had was the fact that they read the book, did not like the first film because it did not faithfully adapt to the book.  Who cares?  The first film was fine and the second one lived up to it's predecessor.Malcom McDowl played a fine Rainbird as he did an excellent job just like George C. Scott did.  The new Charlie (what you expected Drew Barrymore to reprise her role) does a good job as the now grown up Charlie trying to survive as she is still being hunted.  Rainbird new plan of more experimented kids provides a deadly advisary for her and overall I would say this movie is worth seeing.However like I said I am little more liberal with the way I see movies but I honestly think that if one was to give this half a chance they would enjoy it.
