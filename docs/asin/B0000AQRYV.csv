This family's struggle in the aftermath of the death of one of the children in wartime at the expense of Christmas and the ceasing to celebrate the reason for the season caused me to think of our many serving now in the conflicts around the world.  The tragedy for the young daughter, the senseless cessation of 'living' for her young life at the time of the death of her brother brought tears to my eyes.  The conflict, the inner battles of the parents to adjust to the loss, magnified by the fact that 'memorializing' and remembering the fallen year after year, made me think of what I would do under the same circumstances.  Grieving the loss of a child, not what we are supposed to have to do, and the effect it had on the surviving daughter and her young life gave me reason to think.  God's provision of a 'visitor' who brought Christmas back to them in all ways touched my heart.  This film is well worth the price.
