1051608,A1Y7C52533BA2H,B000MX7UGM,Blake Fraina,"[2, 3]","James Sanchez, a balding, slightly paunchy gay man struggling to make it as an actor and find romance in an image-obsessed Hollywood, suffers an emotional crisis as he approaches his thirtieth birthday. I totally wanted to hate this low-budget vanity piece written by and starring James Vasquez. First, and perhaps most egregiously, it's populated by the entire brigade of queer comedy stereotypes - the slutty best friend, the brassy fag hag, the PFLAG-waving mother. Second, the acting is mostly pretty bland - not bad, exactly - just bland. And last, this sort of storyline has been done [to death] in the gay film genre. But its charms definitely sneak up on you and, about halfway in, I found myself kind of enjoying it.Shallow as it sounds, at first I was disappointed that Vazquez wasn't much to look at, but little by little, his warm, likeable screen presence won me over. And to my amazement, all the stereotyped characters eventually blossomed into pretty well-rounded human beings. I was particularly touched by a well written scene between James and his mother that takes place late in the film. And best of all, like all my favourite gay stories, this is not a ""gay issues"" film. Anyone can relate to James because he's not struggling with problems that are exclusive to the gay community, but things that all of us deal with. All this and a meet-cute romance, too. What more can you ask? I certainly don't think this is the best gay film ever and if you choose to watch it, you'll have to wade through a lot of stale, overused jokes during the first half, but if you stick it out you'll be rewarded with an upbeat, warmhearted diversion.",3,Three and a Half Stars,1202774400,"02 12, 2008",2008,1652,"['James', 'Sanchez', 'balding', 'slightly', 'paunchy', 'gay', 'man', 'struggling', 'make', 'actor', 'find', 'romance', 'image-obsessed', 'Hollywood', 'emotional', 'crisis', 'thirtieth', 'birthday', 'totally', 'wanted', 'hate', 'low-budget', 'vanity', 'piece', 'written', 'starring', 'James', 'Vasquez', 'First', 'perhaps', 'most', 'egregiously', 'populated', 'entire', 'brigade', 'queer', 'comedy', 'slutty', 'best', 'friend', 'brassy', 'fag', 'hag', 'PFLAG-waving', 'mother', 'Second', 'acting', 'mostly', 'pretty', 'bland', 'not', 'bad', 'exactly', 'just', 'bland', 'last', 'sort', 'storyline', 'been', 'done', '[', 'death', ']', 'gay', 'film', 'genre', 'charms', 'definitely', 'sneak', 'up', 'about', 'halfway', 'found', 'kind', 'enjoying', 'it.Shallow', 'first', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Vazquez', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'look', 'little', 'little', 'warm', 'likeable', 'screen', 'presence', 'won', 'amazement', 'stereotyped', 'characters', 'eventually', 'blossomed', 'pretty', 'well-rounded', 'human', 'beings', 'was', 'particularly', 'touched', 'well', 'written', 'scene', 'James', 'mother', 'place', 'late', 'film', 'best', 'favourite', 'gay', 'stories', 'not', 'gay', 'issues', 'film', 'Anyone', 'can', 'relate', 'James', 'not', 'struggling', 'problems', 'are', 'exclusive', 'gay', 'community', 'things', 'deal', 'meet-cute', 'romance', 'too', 'What', 'more', 'can', 'ask', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'best', 'gay', 'film', 'ever', 'choose', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wade', 'lot', 'stale', 'overused', 'jokes', 'first', 'half', 'stick', ""'ll"", 'be', 'rewarded', 'upbeat', 'warmhearted', 'diversion']",N/A

His lifelong dream of being a successful actor seems to be a pipe dream at this point, he's caught in a dead-end job at a theme park, but, most of all, he is tired of being single and having to deal with the phonies and game playing he finds in the gay singles scene.  His two best friends are Roxy, a straight woman who is becoming an ardent feminist, and Brendan, who drags him out to gay clubs where he is soon alone after Brendan quickly finds a ""boyfriend du jour.""  He has an embarassing crush on a hunky (and likely straight) coffee house barista (played by Mike Doyle, a regular in ""Law & Order: SVU""), turning into a tongue-tied, bumbling klutz whenever he is around.  And, although he loves his parents and is happy that they accept his homosexuality, his mother has turned into a kind of ""PFLAG Mom on Steroids"", giving him birthday gifts like a leather sling!  As he approaches the age of 30 (which is old age in ""gay years""), he wants to make some changes, to stop merely reacting to what life deals him, get his career on track, and find a life partner.A sweet, charming, witty and realistic romantic comedy, by first-time screenwriter James Vasquez (based on his own life, and who also plays the lead character) and directed by actress Carrie Preston, which is not without its faults. (I could have done without the cutesy ""street sign"" introductions to each scene, the frantic rewind flashbacks, and the MTV-style quick-cut film editing.)  But its familiar yet original approach, and the obvious efforts that went into the film from all involved, more than make up for any minor problems.DVD has deleted scenes, outtakes, trailers and a scene with two of the actors having their palms read by one of the extras.

The aforesaid certainly describes the film's main character James Sanchez as played very well by James Vasquez (also the screenwriter) who is a little pudgy, balding, shy and clumsy and a very ordinary looking gay man.  James does have the usual dreams of being a very successful Broadway star and the perhaps to find ""true love"" preferably with a very desirable man.As is usually with these kinds of films, James' desires do sort of come true..  He does get his big chance by doing a musical version of Shakespeare's ""Henry the fifth"" of all things which invariably brings him to the attention of his very handsome ""prince"".If the above (along with James) sounds a bit dull, it's not.  You see James is surrounded by some wonderful folks consisting of his mom (who is fiercely proud of him plus the character is very funny and played marvelously by the actress) and two very good friends that are always trying to get him to do more with his life.  Those two best friends are Roxy (she's extremely hilarious too), a straight would be feminist and Brendan a rather ordinary looking gay man that has a whole lot of luck getting ""one night stands"". Both these characters are played wonderfully by the actors (there is also a  nurse in the HIV clinic that is so very funny because she wonders why the hell James is getting tested; he hasn't had sex in about three years!--a great scene with she and James).  Although those friends have nothing going for them in the ""looks"" departments, they don't let life pass them by.  They also try to get their friend James to grab a little ""gusto"" from his life.  Just when we the audience thinks that James is a hopeless case he does start to change, mainly thanks to his supportive and dear friends and to his mom--thus the theme of this movie.I enjoyed this film because the character of James is really most of us--an ordinary person with dreams and desires  that will never in the least come true unless we bury some of our fears and make them happenSo if you want to see a film that is, in my opinion, about most of us but does have a ""good"" ending buy this film.

The general idea is how to make the almost closeted James into a happily paired man and how his friends and family go about making his happen is written with a lot of snappy dialogue and with the introduction of some really fine character actors - Kali Rocha as an hilarious HIV Nurse and Mike Doyle as the super hunk coffee house waiter who is to become James' payoff!Directed by Carrie Preston the film moves along with a fast clip despite the elected technique of 'instant replay' used to define James' illusions from his reality.  The production values of this low budget film are modest to say the least, but the premise of showing the life of a gay man who is not on the top of his life is worth watching.

I like movies that require an investment, that challenge me to do something I wouldn't normally do. So that's what I did with this movie.It started out bad, as some reviews warned it would, so I stuck with it. And stuck with it. And stuck with it - all the way to the end. And it did change, suddenly, after about an hour (a longer wait than I had expected), only it got worse instead of better. What other reviewers liked so much I did not like at all.SPOILERS AHEAD!I do not like totally unbelievable, fairy-tale developments - like princesses falling in love with frogs and living happily together ever after. That kind of thing does not make me all giddy inside and weepy outside. It makes me angry, because never in any possible universe (except Hollywood) does that EVER happen.That it appeals so strongly to gay audiences is pretty disturbing, because it means an awful lot of gay men still despise themselves and rush headlong into any impossible fantasy that slithers their way. It's a drug, an addiction to something unnatural and unreal because real life is just too horrible.That's what this movie is: a sick fantasy. It's even constructed that way, with VERY frequent flashbacks and fantasy sequences and whiny or cutesy asides to the audience by the protagonist.The first hour is almost unbearably tiresome, with its aggressive homophobia, presenting gays as lonely, desperate, driven, bitchy, self-loathing creeps; shifting into fairy-tale nonsense for the last half-hour is NOT the cure for such relentless self-hatred.This whole movie is about as phony and disgusting as a movie can be.

It's about an average gay Joe (Jeff Sanchez, I believe) who can't quite get his career going, doesn't seem to be the type to attract guys at clubs, has thinning hair, and seems painfully shy to boot.Plus, he's a bit boring.  Fortunately for him (and for us,) he has funny friends in the form of one sympathetic girl and another gay guy (who has a lot more luck in the clubs.)  Both support Jeff in his struggle and provide some well-needed comic relief.Just when all seems lost, enter a super-hot coffee-bar waiter who magically takes to Jeff and has the potential to wrap things up in a pretty bow.This film is certainly well worth seeing and it's entertaining, however I wouldn't watch it over and over, and it gets a little slow in places and a little cutesy in others.  The dramatic flashbacks to childhood dreams of ""climbing the wall"" were a little over the top and not really that enlightening.It's probably more like 3.5 stars, but I'll give it the extra grade up, on the curve, for making a movie about a gay man who's not a fashion model and editing that is tight and clever and rises above the average.",4,Funny and cute,1185062400,"07 22, 2007",2007,1209,"['far', 'more', 'clever', 'amusing', 'many', 'other', 'recent', 'gay-themed', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'average', 'gay', 'Joe', 'Jeff', 'Sanchez', 'believe', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'career', 'going', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'type', 'attract', 'guys', 'clubs', 'thinning', 'hair', 'painfully', 'shy', 'boot.Plus', 'bit', 'boring', 'Fortunately', 'funny', 'friends', 'form', 'one', 'sympathetic', 'girl', 'gay', 'guy', 'who', 'lot', 'more', 'luck', 'clubs', 'support', 'Jeff', 'struggle', 'provide', 'well-needed', 'comic', 'relief.Just', 'when', 'lost', 'enter', 'super-hot', 'coffee-bar', 'waiter', 'who', 'magically', 'Jeff', 'potential', 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'pretty', 'bow.This', 'film', 'certainly', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'entertaining', 'however', 'would', ""n't"", 'watch', 'little', 'slow', 'places', 'little', 'cutesy', 'others', 'dramatic', 'flashbacks', 'childhood', 'dreams', 'climbing', 'wall', 'were', 'little', 'top', 'not', 'really', 'enlightening.It', 'probably', 'more', '3.5', 'stars', ""'ll"", 'give', 'extra', 'grade', 'up', 'curve', 'making', 'movie', 'gay', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'fashion', 'model', 'editing', 'tight', 'clever', 'rises', 'average']",N/A

The supporting cast were true to heart portraying people who accept and love the main character and themselves for who they are.  A wonderful gay date film, I recommend it for everyone.",5,Wondeful!,1264204800,"01 23, 2010",2010,368,"['Thank', 'James', 'Vasquez', 'wonderful', 'funny', 'uplifting', 'gay', 'themed', 'film', 'totally', 'related', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'everyday', 'normal', 'gay', 'man', 'looking', 'love', 'supporting', 'cast', 'were', 'true', 'heart', 'portraying', 'people', 'who', 'accept', 'love', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'are', 'wonderful', 'gay', 'date', 'film', 'recommend', 'everyone']",N/A

The acting is bad  and the characters are poor at best.The plot is about a young man who reaches 29 with no job future and social life. James (James Vasquez) has two friends: Roxy (Nicole Marcks) who says she is straight but is questionable, and Brandon (David McBean) who is also lonely but hides it by doing the one night stands. James is secretly in love with the hunk guy in the coffee shop around the corner. He becomes a klutz around him. Everybody thinks this guy is straight because of his looks.At the end of this movie, James liberates himself by quitting his dumb job and trying for acting parts which he has an education. He finds the man of his dreams (the hunk), Andy (Mike Doyle), and celebrates his 30th birthday as a happy man. The message of this movie is that sometimes it is very difficult to find the man or woman of your dreams.For some reason or other all of the comedies in this genre are dignified and pleasant, or a bust. This one is definitely a bust.Added note: For those Lost Fans, Ben plays a small role in this movie as a gorilla in James' job.
