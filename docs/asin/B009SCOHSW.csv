1601757,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B009SCOHSW,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[33, 35]","STRIKE BACK is so prolific with its nude scenes, even the showmakers of GAME OF THRONES are awestruck. Just goes to show that, 'neath all that placid tea-drinking and scone-munching, the Brits flaunt quite the salacious streak. But gratuitous nekkidness aside, STRIKE BACK also rewards the viewer with gritty character development, a runaway train of a narrative, and, of course, the explosive, explosive gunplay. And with its secretive counter-terrorist task force deployed on a globetrotting pace, you may even soak up culture and end up a worldlier person.STRIKE BACK is the only reason I keep Cinemax. Season 2 (or Series 3, if you're in the UK) offers ten more episodes and, at the start, shuffles the make-up of Section 20. Sgt. Stonebridge (Philip Winchester, a Yank actor posing as a Brit) is off the team, having opted for assignment on British soil to be near his wife. Nowadays, Stonebridge is a training officer at the local S.A.S. Training Camp. Or as one of his mates mockingly addresses him: ""Mr. Stonebridge, desk jockey.""This leaves Sgt. Damian Scott (Sullivan Stapleton, an Aussie posing as a Yank) as Section 20's primary field agent. And when Damian is taken prisoner during a soured ops, who else but Stonebridge gets tapped for a bit of a rescue. I guess I can encapsulate stuff and just say that, this time out, Section 20 targets a hijacked set of nuclear triggers. But that's doing a disservice to the show. These ten new episodes make up another thrilling season. There are twists and turns and setback after setback, and, early on, a stroke of tragedy that turns the tables on the Scott/Stonebridge dynamics. Season 2 finds the formerly by-the-book Stonebridge suddenly the loose cannon of the bunch, and the disaffected American, Scott, now the steadying presence. However, in keeping with his bad boy image, light is shed on Scott's murky past, particularly his shady affiliation with the CIA. As always, STRIKE BACK excels in showcasing the emotional toll the brutal missions exact on these super-soldiers. Winchester and Stapleton are so good. They sink into the skins of their characters. Even their silences convey depths of meaning. On the fun side, their tough guy banter is endlessly entertaining.If you've been a fan of stay-at-base tech support, Sgt. Richmond (Michelle Lukes), know that she now deploys to the field more. And, as it turns out, she's a cool-headed badasss. Section 20 is also assigned a prickly new director. Thankfully, British diplomat Rachel Dalton (played by Rhona Mitra, goddess of cheekbones), looks as good in a military uniform as did the late Colonel Eleanor Grant. Charles Dance - whom I mostly know from GAME OF THRONES and from the bad guy in THE LAST ACTION HERO - is wicked good as this season's central villain.The body count meter keeps breaking down on this show. Even Jack Bauer is impressed. It'll be a challenge coming up with a similarly scaled threat for Section 20 to combat next. This unit has already thwarted a biological attack and now nuclear winter. What could top those? What's more daunting? I can't wait to find out.",4,"STRIKE BACK Season 2: bullets and bloodbaths, bromance and bo0bies",1355529600,"12 15, 2012",2012,3103,"['STRIKE', 'BACK', 'so', 'prolific', 'nude', 'scenes', 'even', 'showmakers', 'GAME', 'OF', 'THRONES', 'are', 'awestruck', 'Just', 'show', ""'neath"", 'placid', 'tea-drinking', 'scone-munching', 'Brits', 'flaunt', 'quite', 'salacious', 'streak', 'gratuitous', 'nekkidness', 'aside', 'STRIKE', 'BACK', 'also', 'viewer', 'gritty', 'character', 'development', 'runaway', 'train', 'narrative', 'course', 'explosive', 'explosive', 'gunplay', 'secretive', 'counter-terrorist', 'task', 'force', 'deployed', 'globetrotting', 'pace', 'may', 'even', 'soak', 'up', 'culture', 'end', 'up', 'worldlier', 'person.STRIKE', 'BACK', 'only', 'reason', 'keep', 'Cinemax', 'Season', '2', 'Series', '3', ""'re"", 'UK', 'ten', 'more', 'episodes', 'start', 'make-up', 'Section', '20', 'Sgt', 'Stonebridge', 'Philip', 'Winchester', 'Yank', 'actor', 'posing', 'Brit', 'team', 'having', 'opted', 'assignment', 'British', 'soil', 'be', 'wife', 'Nowadays', 'Stonebridge', 'training', 'officer', 'local', 'S.A.S', 'Training', 'Camp', 'one', 'mates', 'mockingly', 'Mr.', 'Stonebridge', 'desk', 'jockey', 'Sgt', 'Damian', 'Scott', 'Sullivan', 'Stapleton', 'Aussie', 'posing', 'Yank', 'Section', '20', 'primary', 'field', 'agent', 'when', 'Damian', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'soured', 'ops', 'who', 'else', 'Stonebridge', 'tapped', 'bit', 'rescue', 'guess', 'can', 'encapsulate', 'stuff', 'just', 'say', 'time', 'out', 'Section', '20', 'targets', 'hijacked', 'set', 'nuclear', 'triggers', 'doing', 'disservice', 'show', 'ten', 'new', 'episodes', 'make', 'up', 'thrilling', 'season', 'are', 'twists', 'turns', 'setback', 'setback', 'early', 'stroke', 'tragedy', 'tables', 'Scott/Stonebridge', 'dynamics', 'Season', '2', 'formerly', 'by-the-book', 'Stonebridge', 'suddenly', 'loose', 'cannon', 'bunch', 'disaffected', 'American', 'Scott', 'now', 'steadying', 'presence', 'However', 'keeping', 'bad', 'boy', 'image', 'light', 'shed', 'Scott', 'murky', 'past', 'particularly', 'shady', 'affiliation', 'CIA', 'always', 'STRIKE', 'BACK', 'excels', 'showcasing', 'emotional', 'toll', 'brutal', 'missions', 'exact', 'super-soldiers', 'Winchester', 'Stapleton', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'sink', 'skins', 'characters', 'Even', 'silences', 'convey', 'depths', 'meaning', 'fun', 'side', 'tough', 'guy', 'banter', 'endlessly', 'entertaining.If', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'stay-at-base', 'tech', 'support', 'Sgt', 'Richmond', 'Michelle', 'Lukes', 'know', 'now', 'field', 'more', 'out', 'cool-headed', 'badasss', 'Section', '20', 'also', 'assigned', 'prickly', 'new', 'director', 'Thankfully', 'British', 'diplomat', 'Rachel', 'Dalton', 'played', 'Rhona', 'Mitra', 'goddess', 'cheekbones', 'as', 'good', 'military', 'uniform', 'did', 'late', 'Colonel', 'Eleanor', 'Grant', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'whom', 'mostly', 'know', 'GAME', 'OF', 'THRONES', 'bad', 'guy', 'LAST', 'ACTION', 'HERO', 'wicked', 'good', 'season', 'central', 'villain.The', 'body', 'count', 'meter', 'breaking', 'down', 'show', 'Even', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'impressed', ""'ll"", 'be', 'challenge', 'coming', 'up', 'similarly', 'scaled', 'threat', 'Section', '20', 'combat', 'next', 'unit', 'already', 'thwarted', 'biological', 'attack', 'now', 'nuclear', 'winter', 'What', 'could', 'top', 'What', 'more', 'daunting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'find', 'out']",N/A

1601767,AIYHUYQNF5GCA,B009SCOHSW,"Laurence R. Hunt ""Laurence Hunt""","[0, 0]","While this series has some glaring flaws and inconsistencies, that doesn't stop me from loving it. Let's start with the problems. Virtually every episode has one or more shoot-'em-up scenes with a massive body count, often of a dozen or more, and the sequences are pretty much set up like the violent shooting video games that young people have been playing for the past 20 or more years (I assume it's thus being marketed to that audience). Also, there isn't much analysis of why the bad guys are THAT bad, and sometimes, the rationale can be pretty superficial - I thought this to be particularly true at the end of (North American) season two, though I'll offer no spoilers on that one. Finally, unlike, say, Game of Thrones, where ""anyone"" can die, we can feel pretty confident that the two protagonists are going to make it to the end of the season, so long as there are no problems with their contracts, or they don't drop this show to take on something even bigger (and this one is pretty big, mind you).Now, on the positive side... It goes without saying that Philip Winchester as Stonebridge and Sullivan Stapleton as Damien Scott are absolutely inspired. This is a buddy show, and these two guys are perfect buddies in that time-honoured tradition - with Winchester the ""straight"" guy and Stapleton the ""loose (but dependable) cannon."" They are also allowed at times (never for long) to have fun, and that element of intermittent delight was never written into the (earlier) UK season one (see my review of Chris Ryan's Strike Back). As to the production budget, it's obviously of good size, and thus we are able to travel the world (literally) with our protagonists. The screenwriting is excellent, the dialogue regularly engaging and deeply insightful, and the soundtrack/music are state of the art - outstanding. The same goes for the cinematography/camerawork, and the Blu-Ray picture is crisp and clear (you will not get that in UK season one, which is equivalent in terms of the competency of its actors, but produced on a much lower budget). Finally, it should be obvious from what I have written that these are characters you will care about (Mr. Stapleton sustained a head injury in Thailand earlier this year, and I'm concerned for him in the same way I would be for a friend).... but, more than that, these are characters who will teach you about yourself and the world: that is, they often face moral dilemmas, and are able to handle them in such a way that it is necessary to reflect on one's own life and choices, and how we might measure up in the same circumstances. The moral dilemmas feel VERY real - they are not staged or strained, and the actors are at that highest level, in that they have the ability to take us to the unexplored places of our own lives.In conclusion... this series (originating in the UK) was a surprise. I hadn't heard anything about it until seeing the first season blu-ray on display one day while shopping. So I'll rate this one my ""lucky find of the year."" (Last year, my lucky find was Orphan Black, so I think my standards are reasonably high.) If you can handle the extremely high body count, you will be rewarded with every episode. There is very little time wasted at any point in this series. And... season two stands up perfectly well to season one.

The first episode got me hooked right away. I did not expect to like it because of it being an action shooter terrorist military type themed show. But The way its done is amazing. again it reminds me of a really good shooter video game. there is humor here and there and its well written. I bought season 1 and two on dvd after watching the first two episodes.

The differences, Scott and Stonebridge are comfortable as partners once Stonebridge insists on rescuing Scott and they get back together.Stonebridge starts out as an instructor of the SAS, cozily (unhappily?) holed up with his wife, who is bitter that she's miscarried, and seems to blame that on her husband in some way. He deals with this the same way he does everything, he avoids dealing with it. When she is killed by a revenge seeking soldier, he finally shows emotion. Then he shuts down, saying all the right things to make it back to section 20.Well, we all know that the kind of soldier he is belongs out in the field. He will only truly be happy if he is on a mission, taking orders. It is more the adrenaline of the fight that makes his blood sing than any other kind of passion.Scott and Stonebridge reunite and take their sprawling, brawling mission across Africa, spraying bullets like rain. This time they are less alone than last season. Richmond has been allowed into the field, and Baxter, a young fresh faced kid, and the new boss-lady, Dalton, every bit as unlikable as Col. Grant was. Sinclair makes a few forays out of the command center, ultimately resulting in his death. There is naturally a CIA operative who is manipulating things, twisting the knife in Scott to get her way over and over.There is the ultimate bad guy, Conrad Knox, wealthy, zipping down a path of destruction that is both public and private, a nasty mercenary who seems fed up, and the crazy, revenge seeking tormenter who killed Mrs Stonebridge to harass the team all the way across multiple countries.They escape from one impossible situation after another. There are some crazy battles. Watching the two main men fight is pretty intense. There is a purity to their purpose. Some of the others, there is a deliberate viciousness, whereas the feel from Scott and Stonebridge is almost noble, if killing so many could even be called noble.The women are again without mercy, and most of Scott's hookups you would hesitate to turn your back on even to pull up your shorts.If you are looking for adventure, firefights, a series where only soldiers understand what is in the mind of soldiers, but others try to intrude and force their will time after time... then this is your adventure series.

Truthfully speaking, SB is big, dumb, guilty-pleasure fun with plenty of sex, violence and foul language to appeal to the purile teenager in all of us while at the same time providing compelling story arcs.That being said, I was rather disappointed in CInemax's SB season two.  Don't get me wrong, it was still fun but it really didn't go anywhere and the motivations for the main villain were stupid as to seem like they ran out of ideas and just went for Bond Villain motivations.****MINOR SPOILER ALERT*** (This is revealed in the first episode)Another thing that really bugged me was that it was obvious that they didn't know what to do with the character of Stonebridge's wife so they just... y'know... got rid of her... in the most bizarre of circumstances that wind up being a major plot point throughout the whole season.  It was a very convoluted and unnecessary sub-plot that was pretty cheap and obvious to anyone who was paying attention and it didn't even have a decent resolution.  NOTE TO THE WRITERS: if you're going to off a character because they don't fit in to where the show and the rest of the characters are heading, don't drag it out.  Just off them and be done with it.  This show only has ten episodes per season, already.Overall, there was a lot more that they could have done with Cinemax's SB season two but they wasted time on pointless sub-plots.  The mysteries surrounding Damien Scott's past are a goldmine that can go any direction and Stonebridge's character is being woefully neglected as far as development is concerned.Still, Cinemax's SB season two was fun despite my complaint and I wouldn't kick it out of the DVR for eating crackers (and I gladly pre-ordered this set).Of course the video and the audio quality of the set is fantastic on Blu-ray, especially the DTS HD-MA audio track. It's feature-film quality across the board.  The only complaint I have is that unlike Cinemax's SB season one, this is Blu-ray and Digital Copy ONLY and there are no DVDs.  Not suggesting that  I really care because I don't use them for anything other than coasters but I paid the same price for season two as I did for season one and got less less product.  Just sayin'... no big deal really.",3,"Great show, although second (really third) season not as good as first (...or second, depending on your perspective)",1378512000,"09 7, 2013",2013,3035,"['Sorry', 'confusing', 'headline', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'second', 'season', ""'Strike"", 'Back', 'SB', 'going', 'forward', 'Cinemax', 'actually', 'season', 'three', 'overall', 'series', 'was', 'originally', 'called', '34', 'Chris', 'Ryan', 'Strike', 'Back', '34', 'based', 'novels', 'same', 'aired', 'Sky1', 'U.K', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'first', 'series', 'season', 'starred', 'Richard', 'Armitage', '34', 'MI-5', '34', '/', '34', 'Spooks', '34', 'others', 'however', 'character', 'was', 'unceremoniously', 'murdered', 'terrorists', 'opening', 'scene', 'Cinemax', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'so', 'even', 'not', 'technically', 'necessary', 'have', 'UK', 'series', 'tie', 'together.I', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Cinemax', 'first', 'season', 'SB', 'action', 'generally', 'strong', 'writing', 'action', 'series', 'great', 'plot-twists', 'rivaled', 'best', ""'24"", 'Truthfully', 'speaking', 'SB', 'big', 'dumb', 'guilty-pleasure', 'fun', 'plenty', 'sex', 'violence', 'foul', 'language', 'appeal', 'purile', 'teenager', 'same', 'time', 'providing', 'compelling', 'story', 'being', 'said', 'was', 'rather', 'disappointed', 'CInemax', 'SB', 'season', 'two', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'was', 'still', 'fun', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere', 'motivations', 'main', 'villain', 'were', 'stupid', 'seem', 'ran', 'ideas', 'just', 'went', 'Bond', 'Villain', 'motivations', '****MINOR', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT***', 'revealed', 'first', 'episode', 'thing', 'really', 'bugged', 'was', 'was', 'obvious', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'character', 'Stonebridge', 'wife', 'just', ""y'know"", 'got', 'rid', 'most', 'bizarre', 'circumstances', 'wind', 'up', 'being', 'major', 'plot', 'point', 'whole', 'season', 'was', 'very', 'convoluted', 'unnecessary', 'sub-plot', 'was', 'pretty', 'cheap', 'obvious', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'paying', 'attention', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'decent', 'resolution', 'NOTE', 'THE', 'WRITERS', ""'re"", 'going', 'off', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'where', 'show', 'rest', 'characters', 'are', 'heading', 'do', ""n't"", 'drag', 'out', 'Just', 'be', 'done', 'show', 'only', 'ten', 'episodes', 'season', 'already.Overall', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Cinemax', 'SB', 'season', 'two', 'wasted', 'time', 'pointless', 'sub-plots', 'mysteries', 'surrounding', 'Damien', 'Scott', 'past', 'are', 'goldmine', 'can', 'go', 'direction', 'Stonebridge', 'character', 'being', 'woefully', 'neglected', 'as', 'far', 'development', 'concerned.Still', 'Cinemax', 'SB', 'season', 'two', 'was', 'fun', 'complaint', 'would', ""n't"", 'kick', 'DVR', 'eating', 'crackers', 'gladly', 'pre-ordered', 'set', 'course', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'set', 'fantastic', 'Blu-ray', 'especially', 'DTS', 'HD-MA', 'audio', 'track', 'feature-film', 'quality', 'board', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'Cinemax', 'SB', 'season', 'one', 'Blu-ray', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'ONLY', 'are', 'DVDs', 'Not', 'suggesting', 'really', 'care', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'anything', 'other', 'coasters', 'paid', 'same', 'price', 'season', 'two', 'did', 'season', 'one', 'got', 'less', 'less', 'product', 'Just', 'sayin', 'big', 'deal', 'really']",N/A
