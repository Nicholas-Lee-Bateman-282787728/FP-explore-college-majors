Vivica Fox (who was Will Smith's stripper girlfriend inIndependence Day (Single Disc Widescreen Edition)) stars as his girlfriend, and Billy Zane ofTitanicstars as Hendrix's controlling manager. Jamie Bamber with a major Afro (ofBattlestar Galactica  - Season One) seems to be the drummer.""Hendrix"" has the feel of a made-for-TV movie. There are random montages of the '60s that are jarring, and Hendrix's life is put in fast forward. Viewers quickly go from Jimi dealing with the fact his mother is a prostitute, to him at Fort Campbell in Kentucky, to him playing alongside Little Richard. The whole movie has a case of whiplash. There's very little depth. We go from Jimi showing his girlfriend love over the phone, to him frolicking with groupies (the nude one is obviously wearing flesh-colored tights) Jimi's motivations and passions remain obscure. He was a fascinating man, with a deep spirituality. Instead, there's a sappy Martin Luther King,Jr. tribute concert and a stereotyped conflict with the Black Panthers.Unfortunately, ""Hendrix"" worked as a cure for amnesia. It tranquilized me.

(Although I've only see him in one movie.) This has to be one of the most challenging roles for any actor. Wood, however, plays Hendrix as if he was a mumbling airhead. The filmmakers also needed to get an actor who could actually play guitar. He didn't have to necessarily be good, just know enough to fake it. (Hendrix is one of the best guitarists in history, so it's okay if you can't play like him.) Also, this film, being a TV-movie, had a limited budget. The Woodstock scene was painful to watch, especially when it appeared as if Hendrix was only playing in front of a crowd of 10 extras. The costumes were great, but the hairpieces really needed some work.The biggest disappointment was the music. Since, the filmmakers were unable to license Hendrix's music, we get some really bad cover tunes with a singer that doesn't even sound like him.

Its not an entertaining view by any stretch of the imagination and the flaws, of which there are many, are glaring and so egregious they spoil the movie.  I'll touch on a couple of the most criminal.  First off the actor playing Hendrix simply does not have the acting skills or physical resemblance to make a believable Hendrix.  He's not a horrible actor, just in no way convincing as Jimi.  Perhaps they should have cast somebody who had even a remote clue as how to play a guitar.  Likewise the guys playing Noel and Mitch are in no way convincing.  In fact that criticism holds true for everyone in the movie except perhaps for Billy Zanes' portrayal of Mike Jeffrey.  Many of the character portrayals are at best laughable.  Second and most importantly NONE of the music in the film was written or played by Hendrix.  Since the filmakers couldn't get the rights to Hendrix's music they could use only those songs Jimi covered, such as Hey Joe and they couldn't use Hendrix's performances either.  Instead they used some studio band to play the covers and bad Hendrix-like songs/jams instead.  I'm sorry but watching the actors badly pretend to play BAD Hendrix-like songs performed by some studio hacks creates more pain than should be inflicted on any movie goer.

He made a heroic effort to portray a man whose persona, mannerisms, and ""vibe"" simply cannot be imitated. Kudos to Mr. Harris for his bravery. His biggest mistakes were 1. to listen to the director and turn his character into a mumbling buffoon, and 2. Wood made NO EFFORT to learn anything about how to play the guitar. While making the movie ""Crossroads"", Ralph Macchio actually took guitar lessons, so he would look like a guitar player. Wood's hands moved clumsily and uncertainly; and were always out of sync with the music. This was a mistake that doubtless will plague him forever.The director did a mediocre job bringing life to a badly written script. Granted, Hendrix' story had a great deal of tragedy; but I have it on good authority that Hendrix was also a lot of fun to be around.The scene that described his death was not historically accurate. I know people who were personally acquainted with Hendrix and were around when he died: and they told me what REALLY happened that day.The cinematography was trying to hard to be ""hip"" by modern standards; and at the same time create illusions of environments the production clearly hadn't the skill to create. This was especially noticeable during the concert scenes. The sound was poorly done and failed to recreate the acoustic environment of a concert hall.The music was marred by the fact that nobody can play the guitar like Hendrix without sounding like someone trying to imitate him, and Hendrix' estate refused to allow them to use any of his original compositions. In fact, the music was quite pathetic. Whoever was playing guitar on the soundtrack is clearly a hack.The glossing over of the music; which was Hendrix' greatest accomplishment, was truly irritating. All it was was sensationalism and Hollywood glamor: all flash and no substance - which does a great disservice to Hendrix' legacy, musical genius, and life.The whole thing made me sick.",1,Unforgivable,1102896000,"12 13, 2004",2004,2002,"['Do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'money', 'see', 'this.Wood', 'Harris', 'not', 'bad', 'actor', 'antithesis', 'made', 'heroic', 'effort', 'portray', 'man', 'persona', 'mannerisms', 'vibe', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'imitated', 'Kudos', 'Mr.', 'Harris', 'bravery', 'biggest', 'mistakes', 'were', '1.', 'listen', 'director', 'turn', 'character', 'mumbling', 'buffoon', '2', 'Wood', 'made', 'NO', 'EFFORT', 'learn', 'anything', 'how', 'play', 'guitar', 'making', 'movie', 'Crossroads', 'Ralph', 'Macchio', 'actually', 'took', 'guitar', 'lessons', 'would', 'look', 'guitar', 'player', 'Wood', 'hands', 'moved', 'clumsily', 'uncertainly', 'were', 'always', 'sync', 'music', 'was', 'mistake', 'doubtless', 'will', 'plague', 'forever.The', 'director', 'did', 'mediocre', 'job', 'bringing', 'life', 'badly', 'written', 'script', 'Granted', 'Hendrix', 'story', 'had', 'great', 'deal', 'tragedy', 'have', 'good', 'authority', 'Hendrix', 'was', 'also', 'lot', 'fun', 'be', 'around.The', 'scene', 'described', 'death', 'was', 'not', 'historically', 'accurate', 'know', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'personally', 'acquainted', 'Hendrix', 'were', 'around', 'when', 'died', 'told', 'what', 'REALLY', 'happened', 'day.The', 'cinematography', 'was', 'trying', 'hard', 'be', 'hip', 'modern', 'standards', 'same', 'time', 'create', 'illusions', 'environments', 'production', 'clearly', 'had', ""n't"", 'skill', 'create', 'was', 'especially', 'noticeable', 'concert', 'scenes', 'sound', 'was', 'poorly', 'done', 'failed', 'recreate', 'acoustic', 'environment', 'concert', 'hall.The', 'music', 'was', 'marred', 'fact', 'nobody', 'can', 'play', 'guitar', 'Hendrix', 'sounding', 'someone', 'trying', 'imitate', 'Hendrix', 'estate', 'refused', 'allow', 'use', 'original', 'compositions', 'fact', 'music', 'was', 'quite', 'pathetic', 'Whoever', 'was', 'playing', 'guitar', 'soundtrack', 'clearly', 'hack.The', 'glossing', 'music', 'was', 'Hendrix', 'greatest', 'accomplishment', 'was', 'truly', 'irritating', 'was', 'was', 'sensationalism', 'Hollywood', 'glamor', 'flash', 'substance', 'great', 'disservice', 'Hendrix', 'legacy', 'musical', 'genius', 'life.The', 'whole', 'thing', 'made', 'sick']",Hendrix

Leon Ichaso's biopic of Hendrix does a decent job of showing the rise and fall of Jimi Hendrix's career. What you get here is some shoddy casting and uninspiring use of documentary-style filming causes the film to lose much of its entertainment value.However tired it might be, the standard biopic format deserves credit for its flexibility: It's capable of accommodating just about any sort of celebrity life that began unassumingly and ended prematurely. Start with some childhood scenes, segue into a young adulthood filled with wide-eyed innocence and unbridled promise, re-create the most famous moments of success, dwell on the period of decline, draw out the final days, and, boom, you've got yourself a biopic. Even class acts like ""Man On The Moon"" and ""Pollock"" wallow in the old clich&eacute;s.Often, filmmakers seem more interested in following the formula than in portraying their subjects' actual lives. So it is with Hendrix, a made-for-cable look at the life of Jimi Hendrix that could just as easily have been about Sam Cooke, Gram Parsons, Bix Beiderbecke, or anyone else who made beautiful music and died too young. Relative unknown Wood Harris plays Hendrix, and plays him well, but the film never really gets at what made Hendrix's music special. It seems to spring fully formed from his guitar while the rest of Hendrix travels through one bit of expository dialogue after another, when he's not thrown into lovingly shot scenes of rock 'n' roll decadence. ""You're gonna lend me your boyfriend Keith Richards' guitar?"" goes one helpful line of dialogue, spoken shortly before Hendrix's ascent to stardom. Once there, he seems to wander in and out of the psychedelic harem from the original cover of Electric Ladyland, when he's not arguing with manager Michael Jeffrey (a villainous, bewigged Billy Zane) about the direction of his career.All the while, director Leon Ichaso (El S&uacute;per) pauses occasionally for montages of stock footage featuring pictures of The Beatles and hippies, lest anyone forget that Hendrix lived in the '60s.

I was excited to see what it had in store for me latter I found out it had nothing in store for me. This movie is the worst movie you could possibly watch this movie just brings HENDRIX down 100% its an insult the way they casted the actor who was supposed to be Jimi Hendrix. This whole movie brings the wrong example of how Jimi Hendrix got started alot of it is made up. Ya I understand they could not have the orginal rights to the Hendrix songs for the movie so they had a band play Hendrix  but boy the band sucked&gt;&gt;it just maded this DVD go further down hill wow. If you never heard of Jimi Hendrix and want to buy this then dont because you will get lead on the wrong way. In the future I am sure they will come out with a better movie of Jimi Hendrix the cast will be better so will the music. The actors in this movie sucked this movie is as worst as it can get. You can believe me or not on this but im telling my 100% truth dont buy this. I do have something you may want to look into of buying Jimi Hendrix to get started on DVD buy Experience Hendrix you will love it. p.s. check out my other reviews!,1,THIS MOVIE SUCKS!,1072828800,"12 31, 2003",2003,1379,"['am', 'huge', 'classic', 'rock', 'fan', 'listen', 'classic', 'rock', 'example', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'have', 'CD', 'DVD', 'Hendrix', 'study', 'guy', 'love', 'guy', 'went', 'Giant', 'Eagle', 'rent', 'movies', 'one', 'day', 'saw', 'one', 'titled', 'HENDRIX', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'what', 'had', 'store', 'latter', 'found', 'had', 'nothing', 'store', 'movie', 'worst', 'movie', 'could', 'possibly', 'watch', 'movie', 'just', 'HENDRIX', 'down', '100', '%', 'insult', 'way', 'casted', 'actor', 'who', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'whole', 'movie', 'wrong', 'example', 'how', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'got', 'started', 'alot', 'made', 'up', 'Ya', 'understand', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'orginal', 'rights', 'Hendrix', 'songs', 'movie', 'had', 'band', 'play', 'Hendrix', 'boy', 'band', 'sucked', 'gt', 'gt', 'just', 'maded', 'DVD', 'go', 'further', 'down', 'hill', 'wow', 'never', 'heard', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'want', 'buy', 'then', 'dont', 'will', 'get', 'lead', 'wrong', 'way', 'future', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'better', 'movie', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'cast', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'so', 'will', 'music', 'actors', 'movie', 'sucked', 'movie', 'as', 'worst', 'can', 'get', 'can', 'believe', 'not', 'telling', '100', '%', 'truth', 'dont', 'buy', 'do', 'have', 'something', 'may', 'want', 'look', 'buying', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'get', 'started', 'DVD', 'buy', 'Experience', 'Hendrix', 'will', 'love', 'p.s', 'check', 'other', 'reviews']",Hendrix

Remington,"[5, 8]","If the original Jimi Hendrix Experience were put together as poorly as this movie, he wouldn't have had nearly the notoriety that he did during his lifetime.To say this movie is a poor representation of Jimi is an understatement.  This movie presents Jimi as a bumbling, babbling boob!  Jimi was an intelligent, articulate man who was quite existentialistic and philosophical in his thinking.Take the scenes where they replicate his classic 1967 Monterey Pop performance.  Jimi speaks to the crowd between tunes, at times laughing and making comments in a loose and relaxed manner.  On this movie, Jimi is presented literally stammering unintelligibly, making almost no sense, and coming across as a total embarrassment.  For the true Hendrix fan, it's very disappointing to watch.The only positive thing I will say is the wardrobe was very well replicated.  The clothes Jimi wears were well researched.Faithful and realistic to Jimi's life and the way he performed, absolutely not!  No one can ACT Jimi on stage.  Jimi was a total original, one of a kind, never to be repeated.  The makers of this movie would have been better off splicing the original footage.  As it is, this movie never uses the original soundtrack for scenes such as the Woodstock Festival, probably because they weren't able to get the rights to do so.  So, what you have here is an actor playing Jimi and some studio guitarist trying to play in the style of Jimi.  The Star Spangled Banner becomes the Star Mangled Banner.  The performances are far inferior to the original and sure to turn-off young, prospective fans.Steer clear of this movie; don't waste your money.  It's a Stinker with a capital S!  Take your money and buy one of the true Jimi DVDs or videos that are on sale at Amazon.  You'll get the man and his music and be a lot happier than if you waste it on this movie.",1,Wow... could it have been made any worse?,1064880000,"09 30, 2003",2003,1857,"['original', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'Experience', 'were', 'put', 'together', 'as', 'poorly', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'nearly', 'notoriety', 'did', 'lifetime.To', 'say', 'movie', 'poor', 'representation', 'Jimi', 'understatement', 'movie', 'Jimi', 'bumbling', 'babbling', 'boob', 'Jimi', 'was', 'intelligent', 'articulate', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'quite', 'existentialistic', 'philosophical', 'thinking.Take', 'scenes', 'where', 'replicate', 'classic', '1967', 'Monterey', 'Pop', 'performance', 'Jimi', 'crowd', 'tunes', 'times', 'laughing', 'making', 'comments', 'loose', 'relaxed', 'manner', 'movie', 'Jimi', 'presented', 'literally', 'stammering', 'unintelligibly', 'making', 'almost', 'sense', 'coming', 'total', 'embarrassment', 'true', 'Hendrix', 'fan', 'very', 'disappointing', 'watch.The', 'only', 'positive', 'thing', 'will', 'say', 'wardrobe', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'replicated', 'clothes', 'Jimi', 'wears', 'were', 'well', 'researched.Faithful', 'realistic', 'Jimi', 'life', 'way', 'performed', 'absolutely', 'not', 'one', 'can', 'ACT', 'Jimi', 'stage', 'Jimi', 'was', 'total', 'original', 'one', 'kind', 'never', 'be', 'repeated', 'makers', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'splicing', 'original', 'footage', 'movie', 'never', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'scenes', 'such', 'Woodstock', 'Festival', 'probably', 'were', ""n't"", 'able', 'get', 'rights', 'do', 'so', 'So', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'actor', 'playing', 'Jimi', 'studio', 'guitarist', 'trying', 'play', 'style', 'Jimi', 'Star', 'Spangled', 'Banner', 'Star', 'Mangled', 'Banner', 'performances', 'are', 'far', 'inferior', 'original', 'sure', 'turn-off', 'young', 'prospective', 'fans.Steer', 'clear', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'Stinker', 'capital', 'S', 'Take', 'money', 'buy', 'one', 'true', 'Jimi', 'DVDs', 'videos', 'are', 'sale', 'Amazon', ""'ll"", 'get', 'man', 'music', 'be', 'lot', 'happier', 'waste', 'movie']",Hendrix

If you have to see it out of curiousity then rent it.  Other negative reviews have detailed some of the problems, but what must be stressed here is the lack of quality music.Hendrix was a great musician, but here you have a film about a musician whose music is not highlighted.  I particularly hated the way Wood Harris played Jimi.  Why the producers felt it most important to find someone that sort of looked like Hendrix regardless of talent I'll never know.  Harris' lack of talent was the reason for the MTV fast cut, mocumentry style camera work which is particularly annoying.Bottom line: Poor soundtrack, poor acting, poor screenplay.

572748,AK3DY70GYZB2G,B000059H94,"Rex Marksmanson ""HEYO!""","[1, 2]","&quot;Hendrix&quot; isn't exactly a top-notch movie, in fact, in many ways it's a real dud.  However, it is a movie that is indeed worth seeing at least once if you're a Jimi Hendrix fan.  Admittedly there are many problems with it, and while it has some positive aspects it's not easy to overlook the downsides.First and foremost the movie very hastily covers Hendrix's early years, most notably his childhood, which should have been focused on more.  His cold relationship with his mother is hardly established, aside from a brief scene between the two.  Another important part of Jimi's life, his tenure in the U.S. Army as a Paratrooper is very hastily done and is quite dissapointing.  While it's entertaining to see Jimi outplay Little Richard and then get booted off the tour for doing so, it's incorrect, I wont bore you with facts, but it's something to keep in mind.  Jimi's time as a studio musician is only mentioned by Jimi himself during one or two scenes, and that's about it.Now I can overlook those facts, but the thing that dissapoints me the most is how they handled The Experience.  Bassist Noel Redding, while with some short and so-so scenes, is hardly paid any mind to, and even less for drummer Mitch Mitchell.  They fail to truely give Hendrix's band mates credit, nor do they do justice to the charisma between the three.  Hendrix's time after The Experience with The Band of Gyspys is served even less time, another important fact to Jimi's career brushed aside.Another flaw are the &quot;musicians&quot; themselves...they aren't even playing the instruments or making any attempt to make it look like they are for that matter.  During several drum rolls Mitch Mitchell sits there and hits one cymbal, it looks quite ridiculous to say the least.  Even Hendrix himself looks like he's just an amature who walked into a guitar shop, plucking the strings.  Last, but not least, is the movie uses no actualy Hendrix recordings, calling upon studio musicians to try and mock Hendrix, as many reviewers have mentioned before, the National Anthem at Woodstock is almost painful to listen to.So why see this movie just once? To be honest, while I took issue with all of these negative facts, I still enjoyed it to a degree.  Wood Harris, who plays Hendrix, does a fairly good job of capturing Jimi, though this is almost impossible to do.  The dialogue between Hendrix and others is entertaining with some unrealistic yet memorable lines.  I was glad that Hendrix's conflict between appealing to a mainstream white audience and appealing to his black roots was shown during a conversation with two Black Panther representatives.If you're a Hendrix fan, be prepared for this movie to have it's flaws, but don't dwell on them, see it at least once for the positive aspects, not the negatives.  As for the three men who wrote this, if you plan to write a more in depth sequel of sorts, do it right this time.  A movie about Jimi Hendrix needs time to establish his life, his career and his downfall, even if it meant a three hour film, I don't know of one Hendrix fan who wouldn't enjoy every minute of it.",3,It's worth seeing once despite it's many flaws.,1086393600,"06 5, 2004",2004,3122,"['quot', 'Hendrix', 'quot', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'top-notch', 'movie', 'fact', 'many', 'ways', 'real', 'dud', 'However', 'movie', 'indeed', 'worth', 'seeing', 'least', 'once', ""'re"", 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'fan', 'Admittedly', 'are', 'many', 'problems', 'positive', 'aspects', 'not', 'easy', 'overlook', 'downsides.First', 'foremost', 'movie', 'very', 'hastily', 'Hendrix', 'early', 'years', 'most', 'notably', 'childhood', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'focused', 'more', 'cold', 'relationship', 'mother', 'hardly', 'established', 'aside', 'brief', 'scene', 'two', 'important', 'part', 'Jimi', 'life', 'tenure', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'Paratrooper', 'very', 'hastily', 'done', 'quite', 'dissapointing', 'entertaining', 'see', 'Jimi', 'outplay', 'Little', 'Richard', 'then', 'get', 'booted', 'off', 'tour', 'doing', 'so', 'incorrect', 'wont', 'facts', 'something', 'keep', 'mind', 'Jimi', 'time', 'studio', 'musician', 'only', 'mentioned', 'Jimi', 'one', 'two', 'scenes', 'it.Now', 'can', 'overlook', 'facts', 'thing', 'most', 'how', 'handled', 'Experience', 'Bassist', 'Noel', 'Redding', 'short', 'so-so', 'scenes', 'hardly', 'paid', 'mind', 'even', 'less', 'drummer', 'Mitch', 'Mitchell', 'fail', 'truely', 'give', 'Hendrix', 'band', 'credit', 'do', 'do', 'justice', 'charisma', 'three', 'Hendrix', 'time', 'Experience', 'Band', 'Gyspys', 'served', 'even', 'less', 'time', 'important', 'fact', 'Jimi', 'career', 'brushed', 'aside.Another', 'flaw', 'are', 'quot', 'musicians', 'quot', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'playing', 'instruments', 'making', 'attempt', 'make', 'look', 'are', 'matter', 'several', 'drum', 'rolls', 'Mitch', 'Mitchell', 'one', 'cymbal', 'quite', 'ridiculous', 'say', 'least', 'Even', 'Hendrix', 'just', 'amature', 'who', 'walked', 'guitar', 'shop', 'plucking', 'strings', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'movie', 'actualy', 'Hendrix', 'recordings', 'calling', 'studio', 'musicians', 'try', 'mock', 'Hendrix', 'many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'National', 'Anthem', 'Woodstock', 'almost', 'painful', 'listen', 'to.So', 'why', 'see', 'movie', 'just', 'once', 'be', 'honest', 'took', 'issue', 'negative', 'facts', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'degree', 'Wood', 'Harris', 'who', 'Hendrix', 'fairly', 'good', 'job', 'capturing', 'Jimi', 'almost', 'impossible', 'do', 'dialogue', 'Hendrix', 'others', 'entertaining', 'unrealistic', 'yet', 'memorable', 'lines', 'was', 'glad', 'Hendrix', 'conflict', 'appealing', 'mainstream', 'white', 'audience', 'appealing', 'black', 'roots', 'was', 'shown', 'conversation', 'two', 'Black', 'Panther', 'representatives.If', ""'re"", 'Hendrix', 'fan', 'be', 'prepared', 'movie', 'have', 'flaws', 'do', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'see', 'least', 'once', 'positive', 'aspects', 'not', 'negatives', 'three', 'men', 'who', 'wrote', 'plan', 'write', 'more', 'depth', 'sequel', 'sorts', 'do', 'right', 'time', 'movie', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'time', 'establish', 'life', 'career', 'downfall', 'even', 'meant', 'three', 'hour', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'one', 'Hendrix', 'fan', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'minute']",Hendrix
