There's nothing wrong with her performance, she is funny and brilliant as always but to me Ben Affleck's wooden acting ruined this so-so film. There are parts of this film I like and parts I do not. The film has a week premise and never takes float, the ending is disappointing and the writing is sloppy.

She was excellent as an actress here, but i just don't like the person she played. I did not like her lying about Affleck being a doctor; did not like how she took a bath oblivious to how that might affect her travel mate, or how she got mad and walked out when Affleck's wedding party saw him in the pool with her - she knew what the whole situation was; why get mad at Affleck for being caught in it? I understand she came from a hard background, and did what she felt she had to do to survive, but I like seeing her in roles where she has integrity and principles - like Miss Congeniality and Blind Side. It just was not believable that Affleck and she would fall for each other - be intrigued with each other perhaps, or learn something from each other.  I did not like Affleck's character either - immature, unprincipled, impressionable, impetuous. The movie had nice aspects but nothing came together right. All the actors/actresses were excellent -I love Blythe Danner; it was not the acting; not even the directing. I guess the story was unappealing and some vague sense that this was all wrong. There was no opening of the heart, no transfomation, no beautiful life lessons learned. Lots of yelling and low life stuff and hurt feelings...I turned it off before the ending because I could not deal with the idea that one of the women would be so hurt and I did not even want to know.

Uptight guy by chance meets quirky girl, she brings him out of his shell.Well, I bought this for like two dollars, and maybe it was worth it. I watch it like once a year.

Also, he keeps running into, and can't seem to get away from, some weird chick (Bullock). Are these signs? Should he stop being so uptight, and go with this free-spirited chick? Or should he be an adult and get married and accept his Vanilla lifestyle?The acting in this movie is ""meh"", meaning Sandra has the same personality that she has in every movie; and Affleck sucks, as usual. The other small parts are well done, for the most part.The script is formulaic, and the cinematography at times is interesting. It's just another rom-com where the whacky girl brings the uptight guy out of his shell. The movie opens with a stripper scene, no nudity. There is also a pot-smoking scene in this movie. There is also a scene where Affleck strips at a gay bar.

Amith (kndy),"[2, 3]","&quot;Forces of Nature&quot;, interesting chemistry between two talented actors with a slightly above average love story.I was first recommended the movie by a friend.  I guess many of us guys who plan to get married  should watch this movie because it does hit straight for your heart.The  movie itself is not the greatest love story but it's nevertheless pretty  good.  I wondered before the movie on how the chemistry between Affleck and  Bullock would be and in my opinion the two did pretty well for their  characters. &amp;#63728;&amp;#63728; The movie showed a lot of colors but  many times it's dark.  I wonder why the director chose this and thus I wish  they added a director's commentary with this DVD.According to the  booklet, this movie was shot before Affleck's popularity which was  interesting.  The special effects for the movie are well done and sound  good in your 5.1 digital surround system.  But where the movie is a little  above average and the sound and video well done (I noticed just a little  artifacts but nothing severe).A letdown for the DVD was in the extras  department.  Hardly any.  But I have seen worse and I'm just glad they  included the deleted scenes, trailers and featurette.The alternative  ending was quite interesting and I'm glad they left it out.  It would of  ruined the movie I think.All in all, it's your average love story on DVD  but I give it a slightly above average rating for the twist and the ending.For those who have friends who are thinking about marriage and thinks  about it continuously like I have, let your friend borrow the DVD or tell  him to buy it.

65713,A2198FZZMTJ38H,0783235380,D. Litton,"[5, 9]","There's nothing really more irritating than sitting down to a movie that you think is going to be good and ends up falling flat on its face. &quot;Forces of Nature,&quot; while trying to be funny and cheerful, succeeds only in achieving this goal, and, I must say, very admirably. Promoted as a bright and sassy comedy about a guy trying desperately to get to his wedding, it ends up being more, so much more, in fact, that it bogs the film down in a blithering mess of subplot and washed up one-liners which carry on for too long.The husband in question is Ben Holmes, who hates bachelor parties and can't wait to get hitched with his soulmate sweetheart. Of course, they both live in New York, and since the story needs a great deal of distance to separate our two love birds for a long period of time, the wedding is going to take place in Savannah, where her parents are planning a very festive celebration. Ben's parents want to marry him off for some reason not discussed in the plot. She flies down before him (why not together?), and he soon boards his own plane which has an accident on the runway, leaving him and his seating partner Sarah stranded. Sarah is a bit wild and evasive, without a care in the world it seems, though her admissions will later prove otherwise. Thus begins the wild race down to Savannah, involving natural and human disasters which stand in his way, not to mention his undeniable attraction to the illustrious Sarah.The story seems like it has a lot going for it. So why does it fail in so many places during the movie? Well, there's a lot of things wrong with it: the contrivance of the plot, the bad execution of most of the key scenes, the let-down ending, and most of all, the character of Ben.Throughout the entire movie, our two little nomads run into one problem after another, from things like stalled planes to switched train cars, from stormy weather to geriatrics on a travel bus who believe the lie about Ben being a doctor, Ben and Sarah run into just about anything you can possibly think of. While this may sound amusing, it gets to the point where you keep wishing he'd do one of two things: call his parents and get their credit card number to purchase a ticket to Savannah, or screw Sarah like he knows he wants to, call his fiancee and break the wedding off, and run away into the sunset and never be seen again.The way some of the scenes in this film were carried out, as well as their content, are too contrived and unbelievable to make the movie work. one of these scenes that especially stands out is the trip they take to K-Mart to get out of a rainstorm. Here, they are seen romping through the store, using walkie-talkies to communicate while shopping, sitting in beach lounge chairs having drinks and talking like they own the chain of stores. I'm not sure how they usually operate things at K-Mart, but in my town, they'd be kicked out by management. The ending is the biggest contrivance, and since I cannot give it away, let's just say that there's no way you can have a wedding like that.The characters of the film turn out to be a major disappointment, especially when they are given the opportunity to shine. Ben, portrayed by Ben Affleck, is portrayed as nothing more than a mushy, whining idiot who you wish would trip and break his face at least ten times throughout the movie. While his inner struggle is supposed to provide a dramatic factor for the movie, it does nothing more than make him and the story more annoying and unbearable. Sandra Bullock, while charming and radiant, proves that her character is a big fat waste of talent. Her free-spiritedness and wit grow even more tired than Affleck's whining, though she does have her monents of hilarity. The saddest waste of actress is Maura Tierney, who plays Ben's fiancee. During her stay in Savannah, awaiting the arrival of Ben, all she can do is pout about his inability to reach her sooner, get drunk with friends, be seduced without success by an old high school male friend, and listen to her parents gripe and complain about her fiancee's tardiness.One an even worse note, I must comment on the decision to try and have a parental storyline going on in the midst of everything else (as if there weren't enough to keep up with already). Tierney's parents turn out to be separated, while Affleck's are happily married. They keep popping up just when you think they've been obliterated by the scriptwriter who was deciding to give us a blessing.My summation: too much plot going on, hardly a shred of believability, even if you suspend disbelief, and less-than-amusing characters, all combined into one large mess that makes &quot;Forces of Nature&quot; a very confused and sloppy attempt at a romantic comedy. To thou who wouldst see this movie, I charge thee beware endless subplots and annoyances that make your own life's discord seem like posies in a breezy field.",2,Waste of talent and potential

The movie begins with Ben (Ben Affleck) and Sarah (Sandra Bullock) inadvertently winding up as traveling companions from New York to Savannah after the plane they're on skids off the runway. Along the way they run into all sorts of difficulties. Among other things, they lose their cash, and Ben has to do a striptease in a gay bar to raise the money for them to reach their destination. (One would have thought that two upper middle class people would have credit cards with them. And certainly they could have gotten someone to wire them money, if necessary. But that wouldn't have been good for a cheap laugh.) Then there's the segment when they're on a tour bus filled with senior citizens, although there's no really good reason why they couldn't have found a more conventional mode of transportation. And, of course, they become emotionally (though not physically) involved, despite the fact that Ben is going to Savannah for his wedding to Bridget (Maura Tierney), which, by the time he and Sarah arrive in Savannah, we're sure he'll call off.The movie is partially redeemed by the excellent acting on the part of Affleck and Bullock.

One is a free spirit who lives by the codes of her own rules (Sarah, played by Sandra Bullock), and the other is a man who is about to get married and plays by the rules and basically fears change (Ben, played by Ben Affleck). Ben and Sarah are on a flight on its way to Savannah, but the plane has an accident. Ben is on his way to a wedding, and Sarah has to go to Savannah to claim $25 grand by selling a donut shops she owns. They hitch a ride in a rental car with a guy named Vic who smokes pot, and they are later caught and held, eventually released. Other events occur, such as them hitcing a ride with a real estate bus, pretending to be married so they can find their way down to Savannah. She lies about them being married, and him being a doctor. Of course they spar heads a few times, he is uneasy with her carefree attitude and she wants him to live a little more. Their lies catch up with them and put them in compromising positions, prompting Ben to strip in a gay bar for money to buy a car, so they can leave this town before they are arrested for fraud and not paying their motel bill. There's lots going on, and fate doesn't seem to be on their side. Ben takes this to mean he shouldn't get married, everyone gives him bad advice on marriage, and he is starting to doubt his intentions as well. We later find out Sarah is married and has a child from a previous marriage, who she had not seen in 2 years. She wants to give him the money she is after, but we find out her child was taken away from her, which is basically a sore spot for her. In the end, when Ben thinks he is going to dump his bride, he makes it and decides to marry her in Hawaii...and Sarah is reunited with her son and seems to be on the road to reconciliation with him.The movie was fun to watch, with all the twists and turns from nowhere, the road trip from hell basically.

65732,A152C8GYY25HAH,0783235380,Matthew Horner,"[2, 4]","In the realm of romantic comedy, Forces of Nature might be described as earnest. Its makers intended to make something original, and while they did not succeed, it was not from lack of trying. The laughs and, to a degree, the romance are here, but the movie never reaches the heights it aims for.Ben and Bridget [Ben Affleck and Maury Tierney] are to be wed in a few days at her parents' home in Savannah. He is to fly from New York City for the event. Ben writes blurbs for book jackets for a living. He's a somewhat stuffy fellow who never lets himself go. On the airplane, he meets Sarah [Sandra Bullock], a whacky free spirits with a heart of gold - the kind who exists only in movies. [You know this character. It's the one that makes a complete mess of life, yet always ends up somehow nobler than everyone else.] She tries to strikes up a merry conversation with the reticent Ben. Her attempts are interrupted when a seagull gets sucked into one of the plane's engines. This causes the craft to veer off the runway while attempting take off. Unscathed, the two find themselves hitching a ride with a mad man. Thus begins their often hilarious road trip together. Ben must make it to the wedding on time, and Sarah must get to Savannah for her own reasons.Forces of Nature is Bullock's third foray into playing a romantic lead, and it is her best attempt. It is Affleck's first try. There is a certain amount of chemistry between the two leads, but I am convinced that Bullock's forte will eventual prove to be in other areas. This is not necessarily a negative criticism, for the same can be said of Glenn Close, Sigourney Weaver and Meryl Streep. As for Affleck, he still exhibits an immaturity which does not lend itself well to this kind of role.Most of the humor is not provided by the two stars. It comes in the form of the characters they run into, whose observations about relationships and marriage are sharp and witty. Interest is also provided by a series of calamities, many of them natural, which conspire to delay the couple from reaching their destination.The film's major flaw, unfortunately, is its ending. Given the premise that the forces of nature will conspire to keep you from going down the wrong path in life, the conclusion seems exceptionally unnatural.",3,Romantic comedy succeeds except for its ending,1016755200,"03 22, 2002",2002,2285,"['realm', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Forces', 'Nature', 'might', 'be', 'described', 'earnest', 'makers', 'intended', 'make', 'something', 'original', 'did', 'not', 'succeed', 'was', 'not', 'lack', 'trying', 'laughs', 'degree', 'romance', 'are', 'here', 'movie', 'never', 'heights', 'for.Ben', 'Bridget', '[', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Maury', 'Tierney', ']', 'are', 'be', 'wed', 'few', 'days', 'parents', 'home', 'Savannah', 'fly', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'event', 'Ben', 'blurbs', 'book', 'jackets', 'living', 'somewhat', 'stuffy', 'fellow', 'who', 'never', 'go', 'airplane', 'Sarah', '[', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', ']', 'whacky', 'free', 'spirits', 'heart', 'gold', 'kind', 'who', 'only', 'movies', '[', 'know', 'character', 'one', 'complete', 'mess', 'life', 'always', 'up', 'somehow', 'nobler', 'everyone', 'else', ']', 'strikes', 'up', 'merry', 'conversation', 'reticent', 'Ben', 'attempts', 'are', 'interrupted', 'when', 'seagull', 'sucked', 'one', 'plane', 'engines', 'craft', 'veer', 'off', 'runway', 'attempting', 'take', 'off', 'Unscathed', 'two', 'find', 'hitching', 'ride', 'mad', 'man', 'Thus', 'often', 'hilarious', 'road', 'trip', 'together', 'Ben', 'must', 'make', 'wedding', 'time', 'Sarah', 'must', 'get', 'Savannah', 'own', 'reasons.Forces', 'Nature', 'Bullock', 'third', 'foray', 'playing', 'romantic', 'lead', 'best', 'attempt', 'Affleck', 'first', 'try', 'certain', 'amount', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'am', 'convinced', 'Bullock', 'forte', 'will', 'eventual', 'prove', 'be', 'other', 'areas', 'not', 'necessarily', 'negative', 'criticism', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Affleck', 'still', 'immaturity', 'not', 'lend', 'well', 'kind', 'role.Most', 'humor', 'not', 'provided', 'two', 'stars', 'form', 'characters', 'run', 'observations', 'relationships', 'marriage', 'are', 'sharp', 'witty', 'Interest', 'also', 'provided', 'series', 'calamities', 'many', 'natural', 'conspire', 'delay', 'couple', 'reaching', 'destination.The', 'film', 'major', 'flaw', 'unfortunately', 'ending', 'Given', 'premise', 'forces', 'nature', 'will', 'conspire', 'keep', 'going', 'down', 'wrong', 'path', 'life', 'conclusion', 'exceptionally', 'unnatural']",Forces of Nature

Ben Affleck plays Ben who is on his way to his wedding but gets stuck with the kooky Sarah (Bullock) when their plane crashes. Then a manic road journey takes place as together they attempt to reach their destination. Except the journey never is that manic and the comedy is constrained somewhat by some drama elements. To give the film credit it is beautifully shot, almost to the point of distraction. Sandra is lost in dodgy make up as the wacky Sarah who serves as a temptation to uptight Ben. The fact that they inspire each other is predicatable, but the ending is not. That this film is billed as a romantic comedy is not quite accurate. It is not funny enough, there is the dramatic edge to the story that is almost more effective and the romance is not supplied in the usual way.

65744,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,0783235380,Roland E. Zwick,"[24, 27]","In &quot;Forces of Nature,&quot; Ben Affleck stars as Ben, a repressed,  buttoned-up stuffed shirt writer who, through a series of natural and  manmade mishaps, ends up spending the several days before his impending  marriage in the company of a freespirited, totally spontaneous and  liberated young woman named Sarah, played by Sandra Bullock.For the  vast majority of the film's running time, the screenplay follows the  conventions of the opposites-attract scenario almost slavishly. The script  even provides Ben's fiancee with an overly-convenient replacement in the  form of a now-hunky childhood friend she has not seen in years who  rekindles sparks with her on the eve of the wedding.Thus, with the  troublesome fiance conveniently out of the way, the stage is set for the  predictable true love romantic finale. But, damn, if the writers don't pull  the rug out from under us and shatter the time-honored cliche. This is  particularly surprising because, up to now, the film has exhibited no trace  of iconoclasm in either its plot or character development. In fact, the  screenplay is less a full-fledged narrative than a series of photographic  montage sequences strung lazily together as Ben and Sarah engage in one  cutesy situation and encounter after another. Thus, the unconventionality  of the resolution comes as an even more stunning surprise than it otherwise  might.Affleck and Bullock are very appealing as two young people who  complement each other's strengths and weaknesses and who learn to offer one  another valuable life lessons. &quot;Forces of Nature&quot; emerges as one  of those rare films that is, perhaps, actually better in retrospect than in  the watching.",3,brave ending redeems otherwise standard fare,964483200,"07 25, 2000",2000,1696,"['quot', 'Forces', 'Nature', 'quot', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Ben', 'repressed', 'buttoned-up', 'stuffed', 'shirt', 'writer', 'who', 'series', 'natural', 'manmade', 'mishaps', 'up', 'spending', 'several', 'days', 'impending', 'marriage', 'company', 'freespirited', 'totally', 'spontaneous', 'liberated', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Sarah', 'played', 'Sandra', 'Bullock.For', 'vast', 'majority', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'screenplay', 'conventions', 'opposites-attract', 'scenario', 'almost', 'slavishly', 'script', 'even', 'Ben', 'fiancee', 'overly-convenient', 'replacement', 'form', 'now-hunky', 'childhood', 'friend', 'not', 'seen', 'years', 'who', 'sparks', 'eve', 'wedding.Thus', 'troublesome', 'fiance', 'conveniently', 'way', 'stage', 'set', 'predictable', 'true', 'love', 'romantic', 'finale', 'damn', 'writers', 'do', ""n't"", 'pull', 'rug', 'shatter', 'time-honored', 'cliche', 'particularly', 'surprising', 'up', 'now', 'film', 'exhibited', 'trace', 'iconoclasm', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'fact', 'screenplay', 'less', 'full-fledged', 'narrative', 'series', 'photographic', 'montage', 'sequences', 'strung', 'lazily', 'together', 'Ben', 'Sarah', 'engage', 'one', 'cutesy', 'situation', 'encounter', 'Thus', 'unconventionality', 'resolution', 'even', 'more', 'stunning', 'surprise', 'otherwise', 'might.Affleck', 'Bullock', 'are', 'very', 'appealing', 'two', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'complement', 'other', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'who', 'learn', 'offer', 'one', 'valuable', 'life', 'lessons', 'quot', 'Forces', 'Nature', 'quot', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'perhaps', 'actually', 'better', 'retrospect', 'watching']",Forces of Nature

Well it wasn't overly funny and it made a real effort to be funny but the ""funny"" scenes were so obviously forced and so obviously dumb that they just came across as stupid. Finding a rental car is not that difficult and that is the basis for this movie. I can't believe that anyone is as stupid as these people were supposed to be. Bullock is supposed to be a free spirit but she comes across as immature, undisciplined, and self absorbed.  This was a total waste of talent and Affleck and Bullock did their best but why people of their abilities agreed to appear in this film is a mystery.  I think what put me off of this film is it's totally unrealistic view of marriage.  Of course these are all Hollywood types where any marriage lasting longer than a month is viewed as unusual.  This film would have you believe that every marriage is at its core -- unhappy and that most people are divorced or adulterers. Men and women are unhappy with their partners and anyone who gets married should expect to be unhappy -- that is the message here, but it is also how most Hollywood types view marriage. Beyond that we have the usual Hollywood view that EVERYONE smokes Marijuana or takes drugs of some sort -- EVERYBODY DOES.  Well I don't think so and I thought this film was simply not funny and I don't see anything humorous about being arrested for drugs.

It posits the somewhat controversial notion that personal truth can be discovered through infidelity, and that life's answers are to be found in  random acts of nature.  Some may well find these suppositions difficult to  swallow, and may discover nothing redeeming in the ultimate conclusions of  the piece.I, however, found the film charming and plausible.  I very  much like the weather metaphors, and the fact that, for the brief time the  movie charts,  the characters seem to have no power over what's happening  to them.  It is that surrender to the uncontrollable which, in satisfying  irony, ultimately brings stability and genuine change to the characters'  lives.  The director amplifies the meaning of this metaphor through the  clever use of special effects in a way usually reserved to science fiction  films.  It's a very interesting technique to find in a romantic comedy.  Unfortunately, to speak specifically about it would be to give away the  ending,  Suffice it to say that it's a great example of how special effects  can be used to bring emotional impact to a film, not just to create worlds.If there is a fault to the film, it is that the chemistry between  Affleck and Bullock works so very well, that it is emotionally difficult to  understand why Affleck would find his bride-to-be, played by Maura Tierney,  worthy of marriage. It is as if the filmmakers would have us simply believe  that if Tierney and Affleck got to the point of a wedding, the relationship  must necessarily be a strong one.  Of course, we can accept that, but  somehow the strength of that relationship is never quite *shown*.  Without  a demonstration of the Tierney's attractive qualities, some of the film's  conclusions don't make emotional sense to us-even if they're perfectly  sensible.Still, the film is a great date movie, and may well have  special meaning to couples who met in random ways.  Its well-crafted enough  that it could be on some people's `favorite romance' list, and I doubt many  would find it unenjoyable.  It's definitely one of the top 20 romantic  comedies I've seen.(DVD notes: A somewhat bland collection of extra  features is made disappointing by uninteresting deleted scenes and  the  absence of director's commentary.  Luckily, the behind-the-scenes  featurette is worth a gander.)",4,Stormy weather brings tranquil seas,957571200,"05 6, 2000",2000,2384,"['_Forces', 'Nature_', 'exploration', 'nature', 'happiness', 'somewhat', 'controversial', 'notion', 'personal', 'truth', 'can', 'be', 'discovered', 'infidelity', 'life', 'answers', 'are', 'be', 'found', 'random', 'acts', 'nature', 'may', 'well', 'find', 'suppositions', 'difficult', 'swallow', 'may', 'discover', 'nothing', 'redeeming', 'ultimate', 'conclusions', 'piece.I', 'however', 'found', 'film', 'charming', 'plausible', 'very', 'much', 'weather', 'metaphors', 'fact', 'brief', 'time', 'movie', 'charts', 'characters', 'seem', 'have', 'power', 'what', 'happening', 'surrender', 'uncontrollable', 'satisfying', 'irony', 'ultimately', 'stability', 'genuine', 'change', 'characters', 'lives', 'director', 'meaning', 'metaphor', 'clever', 'use', 'special', 'effects', 'way', 'usually', 'reserved', 'science', 'fiction', 'films', 'very', 'interesting', 'technique', 'find', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Unfortunately', 'speak', 'specifically', 'would', 'be', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'Suffice', 'say', 'great', 'example', 'how', 'special', 'effects', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'bring', 'emotional', 'impact', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'create', 'worlds.If', 'fault', 'film', 'chemistry', 'Affleck', 'Bullock', 'works', 'so', 'very', 'well', 'emotionally', 'difficult', 'understand', 'why', 'Affleck', 'would', 'find', 'bride-to-be', 'played', 'Maura', 'Tierney', 'worthy', 'marriage', 'filmmakers', 'would', 'have', 'simply', 'believe', 'Tierney', 'Affleck', 'got', 'point', 'wedding', 'relationship', 'must', 'necessarily', 'be', 'strong', 'one', 'course', 'can', 'accept', 'somehow', 'strength', 'relationship', 'never', 'quite', '*shown*', 'demonstration', 'Tierney', 'attractive', 'qualities', 'film', 'conclusions', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'emotional', 'sense', 'us-even', ""'re"", 'perfectly', 'sensible.Still', 'film', 'great', 'date', 'movie', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'special', 'meaning', 'couples', 'who', 'met', 'random', 'ways', 'well-crafted', 'enough', 'could', 'be', 'people', 'favorite', 'romance', 'list', 'doubt', 'many', 'would', 'find', 'unenjoyable', 'definitely', 'one', 'top', '20', 'romantic', 'comedies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'DVD', 'notes', 'somewhat', 'bland', 'collection', 'extra', 'features', 'made', 'disappointing', 'uninteresting', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'absence', 'director', 'commentary', 'Luckily', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'gander']",Forces of Nature
