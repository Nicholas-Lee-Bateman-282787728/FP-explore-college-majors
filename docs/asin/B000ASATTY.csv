932664,A2LJKDPRVR907S,B000ASATTY,Lisa Siegel,"[0, 0]","I really liked this movie, mainly because it's told from the teenage father's point of view.  About 90% of the TV movies that deal with teen pregnancy are mainly told from the mother's side.  This one took a different approach which I thought was a very smart move.  Paul Dano was perfectly cast for the roll of Matt Freeman, a straight A honor roll student who sleeps with a girl he likes and she ends up pregnant.  Both of their parents decide that adoption is the best option for the baby, but as the movie goes on, Matt has second thoughts.  I'm not going to give away the ending, but in my opinion it was a very good ending.  This movie is really good for parents to watch with their teenagers since it will (hopefully) send a message that one can end up being pregnant even if you have only had sex once.",5,Too Young to be a Dad,1261267200,"12 20, 2009",2009,810,"['really', 'liked', 'movie', 'mainly', 'told', 'teenage', 'father', 'point', 'view', '90', '%', 'TV', 'movies', 'deal', 'teen', 'pregnancy', 'are', 'mainly', 'told', 'mother', 'side', 'one', 'took', 'different', 'approach', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'smart', 'move', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'roll', 'Matt', 'Freeman', 'straight', 'A', 'honor', 'roll', 'student', 'who', 'girl', 'up', 'pregnant', 'parents', 'decide', 'adoption', 'best', 'option', 'baby', 'movie', 'Matt', 'second', 'thoughts', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'opinion', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'ending', 'movie', 'really', 'good', 'parents', 'watch', 'teenagers', 'will', 'hopefully', 'send', 'message', 'one', 'can', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'pregnant', 'even', 'have', 'only', 'had', 'sex', 'once']",N/A

I mean if it was it would have been written as an assignment for a paycheck, but the treatment of the material was much more detailed and less PSAish than I've ever seen before, especially for a made for tv movie. The dichotomy of the post-pregnancy teen's jaded attitude towards sex and the rest of the class' rabid enthusiasm for discussing it is very effective. The plight of the infertile woman is depicted well by introducing her as a teacher and a person first and then later revealing her situation rather than just presenting her as a one-dimensional representation of an affliction.

932668,AE6APIV5K93KF,B000ASATTY,"Susan W. Sager ""fancyface""","[3, 3]","This movie was exellent and I think any pre teen or teenager from ages 11 and up should have to watch this movie because you will learn a lot. Many parents don't know that their children are having sex at a young age and don't care to get involved before it is too late. Also some of the ones that are having sex lie to their parents and/or wont discuss it and this is a good way to get invloved with your child life without embarrasing them. This movie is a realization for me and I am only 22 years old but this movie will make you realize it's best to wait before having kids, because they come first and it would be selfish to have a child if you are not ready and to understand that the child comes first. This is what this movie is about, a girl having a child while struggling to stay in school and maintain good grades and the very doubt of ever being able to go to college and having the life that she always dreamed of.  The plot of this movie kept me interested untill the very end and it was a very good movie. I would recommend this to teachers to play in school and parents to buy for there teenagers! I don't have kids but this was a TOTAL realization for me and I wished that I would have seen this movie sooner!! I saw this on Lifetime but I am buying it to show my kids one day because I feel that it is important.
