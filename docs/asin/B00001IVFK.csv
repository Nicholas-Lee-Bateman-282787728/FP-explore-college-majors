People just THINK they know them but do they really?  Watch this dvd and you will find out the facts as you see and hear the struggles they went through.  It is truly inspirational and a story that is meaningful for all. It is deeply impressing and done with excellence.  You will want to stand with them so they are never alone. Recommended for anyone above junior high school age to 100.

Anthony is simply a ""must-see"",""well done"",""moving"",""dramatic"",""compelling""etc.etc. documentary of the two forgers of the early Woman's Suffrage Movement.This Ken and Paul Burns treatise has been so carefully,sensitively and lovingly handled,crafted and assembled that I was moved to anger,incredulity,sympathy,action and finally to just good ol'tears!NOT FOR OURSELVES ALONE tells in vivid detail, based upon the enormous source material and writings and correspondence of the two amazing women of the 19th -century,Cady Stanton and Anthony, who almost in a battle alone, fought tirelessly for the equality and dignity and rights of all women to receive and exercise their rights as they saw guaranteed to them under the United States Constitution and The Decalration of Independence.These two pioneers maintained an endearing fifty year friendship,endured hardships,misunderstandings,trials,boos-and-jeers,and the sometime opposition of their own sex as well as the opposite sex AND race, and above all ,totally opposite lifesyles and temperaments in order to join faculties to push for what they themselves NEVER saw in their own lifetime...the 19th Amendment guaranteeing the woman's right to vote.Without these two women, much legislation that all of us now accept to be totally understood ,would never be in law today.The Burns Brothers have created an absolute masterpiece,running for 210 totally absorbing minutes minutely detailing how these two women met,how they were alike and unalike,and how their neverending faith and trust in each other and their common-held beliefs was the ultimate key for those women of the following generation to complete the task of gaining equal rights for all women.This is a very typical Burns format for his PBS documentaries complete with voiceovers,historian interviews,still tintypes.Where this particular documentary really succeeds above the other Burns' PBS features is the tender and deliciously sensitive narrative that has been scripted to tell Stanton and Anthony's story.This is a very absorbing piece of art that all peoples would greatly benefit from viewing.It is more than informational...it is life-giving.These were the women who ""sowed winter wheat for others to harvest"".They were ""the women who worked miracles!""",5,"""Wheat that was sown that others harvested!"";""The women that made miracles!"";the true unsung heroines of woman's suffrage .",1177545600,"04 26, 2007",2007,2407,"['would', 'be', 'totally', 'inadequate', 'reviewer', 'say', 'NOT', 'FOR', 'OURSELVES', 'ALONE', 'Story', 'Elizabeth', 'Cady',

Finally the long wait is over!  The only thing that surprises me is that it wasn't offered on DVD earlier.  This isn't just some angry feminist rant or emotional tirade against men--the suffragist movement is dealt with as the historical event it actually was, and this documentary goes in-depth with historical details, letters, photos, and even comments from very old women who were just young women when they voted in the first-ever election in which women could vote.  After seeing this for the first time, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, one of the unsung heroes and leaders of the suffragist movement, became one of my heroes, and I immediately sought out a copy of ""The Woman's Bible"".

The documentary also showed how as Anthony got older she became more focused on one outcome (the votes of women) while Stanton became focused on many woman's rights issues.  It shows some hard decisions that the two had to make separately regarding the missions they have given their lives to and staying true to their friendship.  Susan B.
