1568613,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B008JFX04G,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[0, 1]","In ""Absent"" (Argentina 2011), 16 year old Martin has a crush on his 30 year old swim coach, Sebastian. The teen fakes an injury to spend some time alone with him, and to con him into spending the night at the coach's apartment. While none of Martin's fantasies come true that evening, it forces the coach to examine his own hidden desires, especially after an unexpected tragedy forces the night into focus.This is an artfully-made film, with intense sexual tension throughout, conveyed mostly by the director's timing and staging of the story. Impatient viewers may have problems with this, and the seemingly drawn out (and often repeated at the end) scenes. This was illustrated in an article I read about the director's talk when the film showed at the 2011 Berlin Film Festival (where it won Best Feature Film), which made it clear a good percentage of that film-buff audience misunderstood what had happened at the end of the film. (I'll admit I was confused as well, but guessed correctly as to what had transpired.) Not exactly my choice for a relatable, enjoyable film, but I'll still give it 4 stars out of 5 on merit. In Spanish with English subtitles, unrated, but would be a light R for sexual content.

That film, set in Brazil, first alerted me to what great movies were coming out of South America.  This film is an elegant slow burning one in which the lead character, the sixteen year old school boy with very adult motivations, becomes apparently and increasingly menacing as the film progresses.  The allusions to Hitchcock are obvious and substantive.  It is well shot and really austerely but handsomely executed. It is a mark of a great film, which this is, in spades, that you are captivated literally from beginning to end.

1568616,AFZU6XDO5L75R,B008JFX04G,"Darien Wells ""darien""","[2, 3]","ABSENT has got to be one of the most intriguing films I've ever watched. A romance flick turned thriller just when you think you know where it's going. The very handsome Javier De Pietro is ""Martin Blanco"" a 16 year old student who joins a swim team mostly because he is highly attracted to the swim instructor ""Sebastian"" (Carlos Echevarria)and soon devises a plan of seduction to get what he wants.What he actually gets is a bit of resistance from the 30-something, engaged instructor who is not so quick to show interest in the student, and is worried about his career and reputation should anyone, especially Martin, find out about his mutual attraction. But somewhere along the way, things take a dramatic twist and lead Sebastian down a road that he just might not survive.I have to admit this film didn't go where I thought it should. What plays out is a scenario I not only didn't expect, but was certainly not hoping for in my own fantasy, as I eagerly watched, with anticipation of Martin's plan coming to fruition. I like this film but it is very vague in places and will leave you scratching your head as to exactly what is transpiring. IN the end the pieces come together so the viewer understands what's going on. If you get tired of trying to figure it out and turn it off, you'll never understand the plot of this flick. You have to stick with it to the end to appreciate it.The dark scenes I now understand but at the time I was a little unhappy squinting my eyes to make out the image at hand. If you're expecting a happy romantic ending, you won't find it here, but if you appreciate the seductive smile of a young man who is very determined, coy, secretive, smooth acting and elusively slips into the shadows of the moment, to carry out his sinister romantic intentions, you'll be intrigued as was I.Very well done! The acting is excellent on the part of both De Pietro and Echevarria, who portray their characters exquisitely! Spanish with English subtitles that often move along very  rapidly as the dialogue becomes heavy and somewhat distracts from your viewing of the film. You may find yourself replaying portions that moved along too quickly to keep up with.While I was a little disappointed with the plot of this film and I really don't get into thrillers per se, it kept me intrigued enough to hold my attention. The acting of De Pietro (Martin) seduced me into following into all the dark crevices of his scheme. I recommend the film for your viewing, but be prepared to pay close attention. Probably better viewed alone or with someone who doesn't distract you while watching films together.",4,"""You know I could get into deep trouble for this....""",1370390400,"06 5, 2013",2013,2622,"['ABSENT', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'intriguing', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'romance', 'flick', 'turned', 'thriller', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'know', 'where', 'going', 'very', 'handsome', 'Javier', 'De', 'Pietro', 'Martin', 'Blanco', '16', 'year', 'old', 'student', 'who', 'swim', 'team', 'mostly', 'highly', 'attracted', 'swim', 'instructor', 'Sebastian', 'Carlos', 'Echevarria', 'soon', 'plan', 'seduction', 'get', 'what', 'wants.What', 'actually', 'bit', 'resistance', '30-something', 'engaged', 'instructor', 'who', 'not', 'so', 'quick', 'show', 'interest', 'student', 'worried', 'career', 'reputation', 'should', 'anyone', 'especially', 'Martin', 'find', 'out', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'somewhere', 'way', 'things', 'take', 'dramatic', 'twist', 'lead', 'Sebastian', 'road', 'just', 'might', 'not', 'survive.I', 'have', 'admit', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'where', 'thought', 'should', 'What', 'out', 'scenario', 'not', 'only', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'was', 'certainly', 'not', 'hoping', 'own', 'fantasy', 'eagerly', 'watched', 'anticipation', 'Martin', 'plan', 'coming', 'fruition', 'film', 'very', 'vague', 'places', 'will', 'leave', 'scratching', 'head', 'exactly', 'what', 'transpiring', 'IN', 'end', 'pieces', 'come', 'together', 'viewer', 'what', 'going', 'get', 'tired', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'turn', 'off', ""'ll"", 'never', 'understand', 'plot', 'flick', 'have', 'stick', 'end', 'appreciate', 'it.The', 'dark', 'scenes', 'now', 'understand', 'time', 'was', 'little', 'unhappy', 'squinting', 'eyes', 'make', 'out', 'image', 'hand', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'happy', 'romantic', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here', 'appreciate', 'seductive', 'smile', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'very', 'determined', 'coy', 'secretive', 'smooth', 'acting', 'elusively', 'shadows', 'moment', 'carry', 'out', 'sinister', 'romantic', 'intentions', ""'ll"", 'be', 'intrigued', 'was', 'I.Very', 'well', 'done', 'acting', 'excellent', 'part', 'De', 'Pietro', 'Echevarria', 'who', 'portray', 'characters', 'exquisitely', 'Spanish', 'English', 'subtitles', 'often', 'move', 'along', 'very', 'rapidly', 'dialogue', 'heavy', 'somewhat', 'distracts', 'viewing', 'film', 'may', 'find', 'replaying', 'portions', 'moved', 'along', 'too', 'quickly', 'keep', 'up', 'with.While', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'plot', 'film', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'thrillers', 'se', 'kept', 'intrigued', 'enough', 'hold', 'attention', 'acting', 'De', 'Pietro', 'Martin', 'seduced', 'following', 'dark', 'crevices', 'scheme', 'recommend', 'film', 'viewing', 'be', 'prepared', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'Probably', 'better', 'viewed', 'alone', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'distract', 'watching', 'films', 'together']",N/A

I'm thinking to myself this kids gotta be at least 24; I've seen gorillas with less hair.I could understand if there was any sexual situations they might need an older actor to play the part but this film could have been rated G! The coach is supposedly hetro and has a girlfriend but of course has a secret unknown to himself  penchant for 24 year old hairy men; ooh my bad....exceedingly hairy, with a receding hairlines, 16 year olds!I have no problem with the general premise of the film and with the proper actor in the part it might have been feasible maybe even plausible and enjoyable. I'm not saying we need an ageless Ralph Macchio or god forbid Lief Garrett at 16 but geeze, get it in the general ballpark at least. They're just asking too much here; the wrong actor playing the teen, the hairy swim team, the hetro coach in pre-existing hetro relationship; the only thing slightly believable, that a teenmight have a crush on his coach and be manipulative in pursuing a relationship without being aware or even caring of the risks to all involved.Want to see a sweet gay themed film with hairy men; watch: &#34;The Bear Cub&#34;  least wise it's more believable with charactors you can care for.

He reminds me somewhat of the directors I loved in the 1970s and 80s--Bergman, Peter Weir, Louis Malle--in his understated, psychodrama approach. I love it that we have an openly gay director engaging in such important experimental filmwork, and I also love it that his efforts so far have been extremely well-received. I won't comment much on the film itself because more than perhaps any other contemporary director, his work is best viewed knowing nothing about it. I was fortunate to have had that experience watching both films, and that's the way I will approach his work in the future. If he directed it, I'm watching it, without reading any reviews first. I can say that the acting is very good, the score is spot on, and of course the directing is top notch. Why not five stars? Probably just a matter of taste.

1568621,A328S9RN3U5M68,B008JFX04G,Grady Harp,"[5, 5]","Argentinean writer/director Marco Berger has created one of the more subtle, quiet, and genuine examinations of infatuation and love on film. He enters the realm of forbidden fruit - `pedophilia' - reverses the roles, and in doing so shares with his viewers the psychology of human attraction and the manner in which society views, condemns, copes, or embraces the overall spectrum of love. This is a deeply touching eloquent film that places Berger in the echelon of the best of sensitive filmmakers. It is an incredibly sexy drama of repressed passion, guilt and regret.Martin (Javier De Pietro), a 16-year-old Argentine student, is exploring the reactions of his swimming coach, Sebasti&aacute;n (Carlos Echevarr&iacute;a), while vying for his love and affection. One day he fakes of an eye injury in the class, and Sebastian takes him to the hospital. Martin has already planned in his mind a web of lies for why he cannot go back home and finally succeeds in getting an invitation from Sebastian to sleep at his house. It s a night of quiet tension: Martin longs for physical contact with Sebasti&aacute;n while Sebasti&aacute;n keeps him off at a distance, but at the same time is very kind and nurturing. Martin is considerate and respectful, and although he manipulates situations in an attempt to get closer to Sebasti&aacute;n, he never threatens, never behaves any more irresponsibly than any teenage boy would and a lot more responsibly than most. Martin continues to inch further and further towards crossing the line. Sebastian the next day finds out that Martin's parents were looking for him all night. He also finds a note in his car from Martin apologizing for telling him the lies. When Sebastian confronts him, he very openly tells him that he was hoping something would happen between them that night. This infuriates Sebastian and he hits Martin. Afterwards things are not same. Now Sebastian is having weird feelings and he cannot even concentrate on his girlfriend. He keeps thinking of Martin. Martin meanwhile stops coming to swimming class and is spending more time with his friends.  Sebastian must deal with his emotions. He recalls how maybe on some occasions he might have possibly given the boy some hints and starts questioning his own feelings for the boy. Guilt struck, he is now hoping that somehow Martin will forgive him for what he did. The closing scene is profoundly moving.&#8232;The film has little dialogue, a lot of silence described by the impeccable cinematography of Tomas Perez Silva and enhanced by the musical score by Pedro Irusta. One of the reasons the film works so well is the fine acting by Carlos Echevarria and Javier De Pietro along with a supporting cast in small but character defining roles. But the major reason for the film's success is Marco Berger's intelligent, sensitive, and brave decision to make a film about a subject that could have been taboo and instead turn it in to a universal examination of the many permutations of love.

1568623,A8QG61LYK0XO1,B008JFX04G,JUST A REVIEWER2,"[30, 33]",".....Latest Work is so very much the opposite (well, perhaps there's a ""tinge"" of romantic love). Instead, we're beinggiven: A Crush-love...almost a Stalkerish-love.(( THIS IS ACTUALLY A 3.5-STAR RATING // POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD ))(( In a comparison, ""Absent"" is the more accomplished production....both in camera work and locations-wise. And as in the earlier film, here the Co-leads and supporting actors also cannot be faulted. Javier De Pietro, as Gay-aware, swim team student Martin Blanco, delivers an admirable first film performance as a mid-teens young man, who is ""crushing"" on his team coach. Martin has a ""Plan"" (but, unlike in Director Berger's preceding film, no alternative, or Plan B, has even been thought of). Single-minded and intensely focused, our Martin has set his sights on placing himself in his team coach's very own bed. Up next, as our unsuspecting object of affection (I mean, obsession), we have the attractive, student-oriented Coach Sebastian Armas (Carlos Echevarria, an experienced actor of some 12 films). This actor ably paints a picture for us of a serious and never smiling, heterosexual(?) man, who is much concerned for those under his charge...and possessing no(?) interest in the Gay lifestyle. ))GENERAL OBSERVATIONS:- The opening-credits camera shots, and especially the soundtrack, seem meant to be ominous in nature and apparently have been structured to forewarn where this film is heading. They consist of lingering, closeup angles of young Martin's striking and sexily hairy body. All this in the guise of a sports program physical exam (oh, of course). Continuing this fascination with Martin's body, later on, after our young trainee has manipulated his way into his coach's home, various intentionally provocative poses of Martin, in near undress, are provided by our Director....culminating in an early morning, ""touchy-feely"" visit to Sebastian's bed, as he lies sleeping.- We are given long, sometimes static, film minutes (more than one-tenth film's running time) spent in an automobile front seat. Our Co-leads driving from place to place, as required by the storyline. These are uncomfortable (yet probably true to life) times spent together...with little dialog. Similarly, there are MANY other coach/trainee interactions where one might expect easy chatter/conversation. BUT such does not occur...and that is not what I would expect to happen between a dedicated coach and those he is mentoring...but perhaps that easier behavior is not the case in countries outside the U.S.- Young Martin appears not to interact with swimteam mates in a normal, youthful manner...and is shown to roam pool changing rooms in the hopes of seeing other young men in stages of undress.- After unsuccessful attempts to get closer to Sebastian during that night spent at the Coach's home, and perhaps ashamed of his actions, Martin quickly owns up. He does so in a note left for Sebastian, reading that he had contrived the overnight stay (BUT he does not specifically spell out what his aim had been). From that point, Martin begins distancing himself, even missing training sessions. Then occurs an uncomfortable scene in which Coach and his girlfriend (yes, he has one) take seats in a cinema, unaware that Martin and a young female acquaintance are already seated there. One seat separating the 2 men, (as the Director has planned for), we suspensefully wait for awareness of each other to hit the fan. Then, somewhat later, their relationship climaxes (yes, I use that word) in a face to face confrontation: Martin openly admits to his plan for a ""hoped-for-seduction."" ....And Sebastian, realizing the untenable position in which he had been placed, directs a blow to Martin's face, and angry words are exchanged.- Shortly thereafter, Tragedy Strikes.We will never know this film's ""What Might Have Been"". Perhaps even Director Marco Berger cannot know. BUT...in the story's closing 20 minutes, we find ourselves being carried along, within Sebastian's innermost mind, as he lives out each day--though he is acting as in a near-trance. Then, startlingly, we begin experiencing ""What Might Have Been"" memories of past times spent with Martin (but happening as Sebastian wishes they ""might"" have occurred). Closing shots take place with the Coach revisiting the darkened and ghostly poolhouse. Then follows a final scene of our Co-leads (yes, both) seeking and finding one another in the semi-darkness: ....a Sweet Kiss....an Admission of Regret....a Request for Forgiveness. And we see, for the very first time in this unhappy film, a tender smile appear on the face of Sebastian.PS--Oh, face it....I want Romance! (M.

While Plan B invited the viewer to have an open mind about straight men being about to find love and have sex with each other, Absent pushes farther.  In Absent, we have to consider the sexuality of all people--even the young.  Law is clear in most countries about boundaries adults must not cross with young people.  Here, Martin is the aggressor.

1568629,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B008JFX04G,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[17, 19]","This is an Argentinean film from director Marco Berger who brought us `Plan B'. It tells the story of Martin (Javier De Pietro) a swarthy, sixteen year old schoolboy, who has a crush on his teacher, which I am led to believe is a pretty common event. Martins' teacher though is Sebastian (Carlos Echivarria) and he is the sports teacher. One day at swim class Martin feigns an eye injury and the Proffessore has to take him to the eye doctor. Martin though has unhatched a cunning plan that sees him getting to stay the night with his teacher and closer to the object of his desires.Martin just keeps pushing the boundaries all the time but in a kind of innocent way and his teacher just isn't sure what is going on. The following day he starts to realise that Martin is not so innocent and this leads to further complications and gets the emotions of both of them all mixed up.This film is like waiting for a bomb to explode, it is dripping with a brooding quality of lasciviousness that keeps you hooked. There are no bad performances and the development of the characters is both believable and engaging. The musical score is excellent too with just the right amount of mood to compliment the film rather than trying to be a barometer for your emotions.This is a story of the follies of young adult lust and not about the bedroom gymnastics, so if you are looking for something that you want to `interact' with, this is definitely not for you. It is a slow burner and it won't be to everybody's taste, the ending is also fairly ambiguous, so please be warned, but it had me gripped throughout.
