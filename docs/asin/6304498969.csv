426094,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,6304498969,Craig Connell,"[2, 2]","This still ranks as one of Eric Clapton's best and most pleasant ""concerts.""I remember seeing this when it was first televised on TV. Later, it was a pleasure to get it on DVD after watching it on tape for several years. The concert always is enjoyable to watch and listen to, no matter many times I view it.This is a nice mellow-sounding concert and most of the songs grow on you. It's presented in such a classy form that it provides something different: blues/rock 'n roll in a quieter format. This was so successful that other performers copied it with their ""unplugged"" concerts.There are many familiar faces with Clapton here and I particularly enjoyed Chuck Leavell on keyboard. On ""Old Love,"" he gives one of the better piano solos I've ever heard. Leavell is best-known as the keyboard man for the Rolling Stones. Meanwhile, percussionist Ray Cooper is the most fun guy to watch. It's doubtful a drummer ever had as much fun as he does in concerts, especially when he's showing off with the tambourine.All the band members from Clapton on down look like nice guys who are thoroughly enjoying themselves in this concert.....and it shows in the music.",5,The Forerunner Of 'Unplugged' Concerts,1244764800,"06 12, 2009",2009,1158,"['still', 'one', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'best', 'most', 'pleasant', 'concerts', 'remember', 'seeing', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'televised', 'TV', 'Later', 'was', 'pleasure', 'get', 'DVD', 'watching', 'tape', 'several', 'years', 'concert', 'always', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'listen', 'matter', 'many', 'times', 'view', 'it.This', 'nice', 'mellow-sounding', 'concert', 'most', 'songs', 'grow', 'presented', 'such', 'classy', 'form', 'something', 'different', 'blues/rock', 'n', 'roll', 'quieter', 'format', 'was', 'so', 'successful', 'other', 'performers', 'copied', 'unplugged', 'are', 'many', 'familiar', 'Clapton', 'here', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'Chuck', 'Leavell', 'keyboard', 'Old', 'Love', 'one', 'better', 'piano', 'solos', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'Leavell', 'best-known', 'keyboard', 'man', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'Meanwhile', 'percussionist', 'Ray', 'Cooper', 'most', 'fun', 'guy', 'watch', 'doubtful', 'drummer', 'ever', 'had', 'much', 'fun', 'concerts', 'especially', 'when', 'showing', 'off', 'tambourine.All', 'band', 'members', 'Clapton', 'down', 'look', 'nice', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'thoroughly', 'enjoying', 'concert', '..and', 'music']",N/A

426098,A343CRJ1JDE6RP,6304498969,"J. M. Jacobs ""Just one man's opinion...""","[29, 33]","What does it mean to be a musician? I love music of many kinds but unfortunately for me I don't understand its structure, and so I can't seem to figure out how to play. I am a person who constantly has a song running through his head, I breathe in time to music, so music is very much a part of me. That's why it's fortunate for all of us who don't play that there are musicians like Eric Clapton.Ever since this disc was recorded not too long after the death of his son, Clapton has done some work that is ""uneven"" as the critics would say. It's like the Monty Python Contractual Obligation Album - I did it because I had to. He cranks out a lot of albums so it's natural - given that volume - that some will not be stellar quality.Not the case here. In these songs, you see Clapton's heart laid bare. There's ""Tears in Heaven"" - the song dedicated to his son who was killed in a tragic fall from a terrace in a high rise apartment building, an acoustic version of ""Layla"" that will surprise you with its appeal given the difference from the famous one you're already familiar with, there are several Robert Johnson tunes - from Clapton's idol and major influence, and some other songs that all just blend together like threads in a colorful fabric. Nothing seems out of place: the choice of songs, their sequence, the backup musicians... This overall character gives this DVD a certain listenable quality that makes you drag it out and throw it in fairly often. I can't seem to tire of it.At the time it came out, I was designing and selling high end Home Theatre and Music systems, and after hearing and seeing this disc at a Custom Electronic Design And Installation (CEDIA) convention, I picked up a copy to use in demonstrations for my clients. Every time I played it, the people stopped kind of ""going through the motions"" in the demo and were grabbed by what they were hearing ...and seeing.The whole MTV Unplugged is an intimate series where you're closer to the music (as it's all acoustic) and closer to the musicians, too. Here you get it all - the Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack is clean and tight with a rich undertone throughout. The instruments sound warm. The camera angles and the choice of shots allow you to really feel and appreciate the talent you're witnessing here not only in Eric Clapton but in the carefully chosen musicians for this session. Chuck Lovell on piano is a standout among them. Remember the ""Clapton is God"" era back in England? Well, Mr. Clapton may not be God exactly but his playing is divine... always.That's what makes this disc special out of all the others similar to it that you might own. While Clapton is always extraordinary in his technique and in display of his technical skills, on this disc he seems to be most comfortable with the venue, the style of play, the song list, and with his motivation. It's like he's trying to reach us and show us what this kind of music is all about, show us its heart and soul.Isn't that what a musician is supposed to do?",5,Clapton's True Nature Revealed,1127260800,"09 21, 2005",2005,3007,"['What', 'mean', 'be', 'musician', 'love', 'music', 'many', 'kinds', 'unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'structure', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'play', 'am', 'person', 'who', 'constantly', 'song', 'running', 'head', 'breathe', 'time', 'music', 'music', 'very', 'much', 'part', 'why', 'fortunate', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'play', 'are', 'musicians', 'Eric', 'Clapton.Ever', 'disc', 'was', 'recorded', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'death', 'son', 'Clapton', 'done', 'work', 'uneven', 'critics', 'would', 'say', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Contractual', 'Obligation', 'Album', 'did', 'had', 'out', 'lot', 'albums', 'natural', 'given', 'volume', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'stellar', 'quality.Not', 'case', 'here', 'songs', 'see', 'Clapton', 'heart', 'laid', 'bare', 'Tears', 'Heaven', 'song', 'dedicated', 'son', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'tragic', 'fall', 'terrace', 'high', 'rise', 'apartment', 'building', 'acoustic', 'version', 'Layla', 'will', 'surprise', 'appeal', 'given', 'difference', 'famous', 'one', ""'re"", 'already', 'familiar', 'are', 'several', 'Robert', 'Johnson', 'Clapton', 'idol', 'major', 'influence', 'other', 'songs', 'just', 'blend', 'together', 'like', 'threads', 'colorful', 'fabric', 'Nothing', 'place', 'choice', 'songs', 'sequence', 'backup', 'musicians', 'overall', 'character', 'certain', 'listenable', 'quality', 'drag', 'out', 'throw', 'fairly', 'often', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'tire', 'it.At', 'time', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'designing', 'selling', 'high', 'end', 'Home', 'Theatre', 'Music', 'systems', 'hearing', 'seeing', 'disc', 'Custom', 'Electronic', 'Design', 'Installation', 'CEDIA', 'convention', 'picked', 'up', 'copy', 'use', 'demonstrations', 'clients', 'Every', 'time', 'played', 'people', 'stopped', 'kind', 'going', 'motions', 'demo', 'were', 'grabbed', 'what', 'were', 'hearing', 'seeing.The', 'whole', 'MTV', 'Unplugged', 'intimate', 'series', 'where', ""'re"", 'closer', 'music', 'acoustic', 'closer', 'musicians', 'too', 'Here', 'get', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'soundtrack', 'clean', 'tight', 'rich', 'undertone', 'instruments', 'sound', 'warm', 'camera', 'angles', 'choice', 'shots', 'allow', 'really', 'feel', 'appreciate', 'talent', ""'re"", 'witnessing', 'here', 'not', 'only', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'carefully', 'chosen', 'musicians', 'session', 'Chuck', 'Lovell', 'piano', 'standout', 'Remember', 'Clapton', 'God', 'era', 'back', 'England', 'Well', 'Mr.', 'Clapton', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'God', 'exactly', 'playing', 'divine', 'always.That', 'what', 'disc', 'special', 'others', 'similar', 'might', 'own', 'Clapton', 'always', 'extraordinary', 'technique', 'display', 'technical', 'skills', 'disc', 'be', 'most', 'comfortable', 'venue', 'style', 'play', 'song', 'list', 'motivation', 'trying', 'reach', 'show', 'what', 'kind', 'music', 'show', 'heart', 'soul.Is', ""n't"", 'what', 'musician', 'supposed', 'do']",N/A

I happen to love acoustic versions of rock songs when well done. Layla was a revelation; no screaming like an animal in pain, just a thoughtful take on immense pain. Tears In Heaven is heartbreaking, esp. when you know the story behind it. The blues stuff was the reason I bought it originally. This is what EC wanted to do all along, and I am very glad he did it, since he has since done more traditional blues, and less rock stuff. Thank you, Mr. Clapton.I have to ask, though, about the DVD version I have. I finally turned it off after the show started over for the third time. How many times is it on there? And why is it repeated so many times? Is it in lieu of extras, to fill the space on the disc? Whatever. But they could at least have separated them into a menu, so you don't have to stop the DVD in the middle of playing. Very weird.This is one of the older side closure DVD cases; is there a newer pressing of this with a ""keepcase"" that only has the show on it once?

Really makes me feel that I'm sitting in a front row. Eric Clapton presents his singing, lead and rythm guitar, etc right in front of cameras. All the songs are great!!!! Hard to pick up the best.I was first attracted to this CD version. To me, as the editorial review says ""how well rock stars and their material can hold up when stripped of elaborate production values"". I like big arena concerts and I appreciate their performance and show values. But for some of them, I do wonder ""I don't think he's actually playing"", ""they are using somebody or even tapes in order to look like they are playing"", etc that sort.My problem with this CD is that I listen again and again and leave it be in my truck till I think I'd better change it. My biggest curiosity had been who is playing the guitar at ""beggin' pleeeeeeeese""? Sounded like EC but he must have been focusing on his vocal. Yet is this DVD worth buying just to see it? Well, it was him. This is it!! This really shows his talent that he can really sing and play his guitar simultanously, while some has to be backed up either one at the real concert. His backing band is minimal hence no cheating. He even picks up the right moments to push up his glasses!!I don't have enough musical/guitar experience and knowledge but I do know EC is real.
