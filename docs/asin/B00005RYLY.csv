680934,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005RYLY,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 7]","`An American Rhapsody' follows the struggles of the Sander family as they flee from Hungary in the 1950's for America and then fight, first to bring their young daughter home and then to keep her safe.  Because of the War the Sanders are fleeing their country in pursuit of a better life in the America's.  Peter and Margit Sander have two young daughters, Maria and Zsuzsi, but because Zsuzsi is but an infant and a danger to the fleeing couple they must leave her behind to have her transported to them later.  Peter and Margit escape with their daughter Maria, but Zsuzsi never arrives.  Her grandmother couldn't bare the idea of something bad happening to her granddaughter and so she arranged for her to be raised by a foster family until it was safe for Zsuzsi to travel back to her parents.Margit and Peter are understandably concerned, upset and desperate to have their daughter, but they aren't reunited with her for over five years.  By this time Zsuzsi has become attached to her foster parents viewing that as her real family and thus shunning her mother and father.  As she grows into adolescence she becomes rebellious and distant and then finally comes to the realization that she won't be able to accept her new life until she can officially say goodbye to her old life.  Thus, she travels back to Budapest to reconnect with her foster parents.The film, while not a total letdown, fails to live up the material.  The performances by most of the cast are either too laidback and forgettable or so outlandish and overacted that they come across annoying.  Scarlett Johansson, who plays the teenage Zsuzsi, does a decent job, but you can tell that her acting level has matured quite a bit since this film.  Her character really isn't given enough meat to grow with the audience.  She comes off a bit one dimensional and a little unsympathetic.  You never see layers of emotion from her.  You see her hating her parents and that's about all.  When she finally does change it's not a gradual change as you would expect but an almost immediate change that comes off phony.  You'd think that the director/writer would have paid a little more attention to detail when retelling her own story.  Tony Goldwyn, who plays Peter, never really delves into his character.  He becomes almost a prop for Natassja Kinski's overacting.  Kinski actually does really well for the first half of the film and then, after Scarlett comes into frame Kinski's character goes a little insane and her performance gets a little over zealous.The young girls in the film are actually the best actors here.  They come across natural and sympathetic.  Although I will say that to have young Zsuzsi learn English in what appears to be a week, and to know it so well, it's very unrealistic.  The material is grade A, and it could have been turned into a grand epic masterpiece, but the directing was sloppy and the script could have used a revamp.  It becomes B grade entertainment that, while worth a watch through, will never really validate multiple viewings.  If you're a fan of Johansson's more recent award worthy work then I encourage you to see this movie, if not for the very reason of seeing her humble beginnings, but watching this and knowing that it was released the same year as `Ghost World' where she puts in a stellar performance is almost sad.  With the right budget, a better director and a script revamp this could and should have been a great film, but it falls under the category of `popcorn flick', nothing more, nothing less.",2,"Has the potential to be a great film, but falls far from its destination...",1184284800,"07 13, 2007",2007,3529,"['American', 'Rhapsody', 'struggles', 'Sander', 'family', 'flee', 'Hungary', '1950', 'America', 'then', 'fight', 'first', 'bring', 'young', 'daughter', 'home', 'then', 'keep', 'safe', 'War', 'Sanders', 'are', 'fleeing', 'country', 'pursuit', 'better', 'life', 'America', 'Peter', 'Margit', 'Sander', 'have', 'two', 'young', 'daughters', 'Maria', 'Zsuzsi', 'Zsuzsi', 'infant', 'danger', 'fleeing', 'couple', 'must', 'leave', 'behind', 'have', 'transported', 'later', 'Peter', 'Margit', 'escape', 'daughter', 'Maria', 'Zsuzsi', 'never', 'grandmother', 'could', ""n't"", 'bare', 'idea', 'something', 'bad', 'happening', 'granddaughter', 'so', 'arranged', 'be', 'raised', 'foster', 'family', 'was', 'safe', 'Zsuzsi', 'travel', 'back', 'parents.Margit', 'Peter', 'are', 'understandably', 'concerned', 'upset', 'desperate', 'have', 'daughter', 'are', ""n't"", 'reunited', 'five', 'years', 'time', 'Zsuzsi', 'become', 'attached', 'foster', 'parents', 'viewing', 'real', 'family', 'thus', 'shunning', 'mother', 'father', 'adolescence', 'rebellious', 'distant', 'then', 'finally', 'realization', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'accept', 'new', 'life', 'can', 'officially', 'say', 'goodbye', 'old', 'life', 'Thus', 'back', 'Budapest', 'reconnect', 'foster', 'parents.The', 'film', 'not', 'total', 'letdown', 'live', 'up', 'material', 'performances', 'most', 'cast', 'are', 'either', 'too', 'laidback', 'forgettable', 'so', 'outlandish', 'overacted', 'come', 'annoying', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'who', 'teenage', 'Zsuzsi', 'decent', 'job', 'can', 'tell', 'acting', 'level', 'matured', 'quite', 'bit', 'film', 'character', 'really', ""n't"", 'given', 'enough', 'meat', 'grow', 'audience', 'bit', 'one', 'dimensional', 'little', 'unsympathetic', 'never', 'see', 'layers', 'emotion', 'see', 'hating', 'parents', 'When', 'finally', 'change', 'not', 'gradual', 'change', 'would', 'expect', 'almost', 'immediate', 'change', 'off', 'phony', ""'d"", 'think', 'director/writer', 'would', 'have', 'paid', 'little', 'more', 'attention', 'detail', 'when', 'retelling', 'own', 'story', 'Tony', 'Goldwyn', 'who', 'Peter', 'never', 'really', 'character', 'almost', 'prop', 'Natassja', 'Kinski', 'overacting', 'Kinski', 'actually', 'really', 'well', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'then', 'Scarlett', 'frame', 'Kinski', 'character', 'little', 'insane', 'performance', 'little', 'zealous.The', 'young', 'girls', 'film', 'are', 'actually', 'best', 'actors', 'here', 'come', 'natural', 'sympathetic', 'will', 'say', 'have', 'young', 'Zsuzsi', 'learn', 'English', 'what', 'be', 'week', 'know', 'so', 'well', 'very', 'unrealistic', 'material', 'grade', 'A', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'turned', 'grand', 'epic', 'masterpiece', 'directing', 'was', 'sloppy', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'revamp', 'B', 'grade', 'entertainment', 'watch', 'will', 'never', 'really', 'validate', 'multiple', 'viewings', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Johansson', 'more', 'recent', 'award', 'worthy', 'work', 'then', 'encourage', 'see', 'movie', 'not', 'very', 'reason', 'seeing', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'watching', 'knowing', 'was', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'Ghost', 'World', 'where', 'stellar', 'performance', 'almost', 'sad', 'right', 'budget', 'better', 'director', 'script', 'revamp', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'film', 'category', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'nothing', 'more', 'nothing', 'less']",N/A

This problem is increased two-fold for sixteen year old Suzanne. Left in Hungary as an infant while her parents and older sister escaped to America, Suzanne is attempting to come to terms with who she is and what she has in common with this family of strangers.Based on a true story, American Rhapsody explores the consequences of well meaning actions that alienate a child from its parents. Magrit and Peter are well meaning parents who leave Suzanne behind in order to escape from the harsh Stalinist regime. Taking an infant with them would cause more problems. So they plan their escape and make sure that Suzanne will follow. Alas, the best laid plans fall apart and it won't be until six years later that their child is reunited with them. Magrit finds that leaving that infant behind has resulted in far more deeper problems than anticipated.In this movie we see the guilt and sorrow of parents who have to leave their child. The resentment and dynamics of leaving one family to another is readily played out is this drama. You can understand Suzanne's pain and anger. You will sympathize with the mother burdened by guilt and is determined to protect this child.This is a remarkable story with great actors portraying those real life people who had to endure such agony. The story is not a &quot;downer&quot; but lends hope to a family's quest for freedom and a better life for their children. It also shows the mistakes that parents make in attempting to protect their children from the reality of growing up.",3,FINDING YOURSELF,1040860800,"12 26, 2002",2002,1625,"['Teenagers', 'have', 'difficult', 'time', 'coping', 'sense', 'identity', 'relationship', 'family', 'problem', 'increased', 'two-fold', 'sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'Suzanne', 'Left', 'Hungary', 'infant', 'parents', 'older', 'sister', 'escaped', 'America', 'Suzanne', 'attempting', 'come', 'terms', 'who', 'what', 'common', 'family', 'strangers.Based', 'true', 'story', 'American', 'Rhapsody', 'consequences', 'well', 'meaning', 'actions', 'alienate', 'child', 'parents', 'Magrit', 'Peter', 'are', 'well', 'meaning', 'parents', 'who', 'leave', 'Suzanne', 'behind', 'order', 'escape', 'harsh', 'Stalinist', 'regime', 'Taking', 'infant', 'would', 'cause', 'more', 'problems', 'plan', 'escape', 'make', 'sure', 'Suzanne', 'will', 'follow', 'Alas', 'best', 'laid', 'plans', 'fall', 'apart', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'six', 'years', 'later', 'child', 'reunited', 'Magrit', 'leaving', 'infant', 'behind', 'resulted', 'far', 'more', 'deeper', 'problems', 'anticipated.In', 'movie', 'see', 'guilt', 'sorrow', 'parents', 'who', 'have', 'leave', 'child', 'resentment', 'dynamics', 'leaving', 'one', 'family', 'readily', 'played', 'out', 'drama', 'can', 'understand', 'Suzanne', 'pain', 'anger', 'will', 'sympathize', 'mother', 'burdened', 'guilt', 'determined', 'protect', 'child.This', 'remarkable', 'story', 'great', 'actors', 'portraying', 'real', 'life', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'endure', 'such', 'agony', 'story', 'not', 'quot', 'downer', 'quot', 'hope', 'family', 'quest', 'freedom', 'better', 'life', 'children', 'also', 'mistakes', 'parents', 'make', 'attempting', 'protect', 'children', 'reality', 'growing', 'up']",N/A

While I have always been interested in the fate of Hungary after WWII, I never had much interest outside the Hungarian Jewish population.""Suzanne"" (Johanssen) is a teen girl living in America with her birth parents. She's been there since she was about five; up til then she'd been living in Hungary in the care of people she felt were her true parents. Her true mother Margit (Nastassja Kinski) and father Peter (the marvelous Tony Goldwyn) are at their wits' end, trying to deal with a rebellious, angst-ridden Suzanne.Suzanne decides to return to Hungary - she wants to see her 'other' parents very badly. While there, she spends time with her maternal grandmother Helen (great performance by &Aacute;gi B&aacute;nfalvy). Her grandmother spent a long time in the communist camps as prisoner. She explains the horrors Suzanne's parents faced, and Suzanne then leaves for home - America it is, then.While all the acting was great (I loved Kinski's hysterics), and I truly appreciated the beginning of the film with all of them speaking Hungarian, I felt it dragged and suffered from amateurish direction. Hungarian director &Eacute;va G&aacute;rdos, who has mostly done music videos and two television films, shows her amateurish colors to the detriment of what should have been a blockbusting epic film.So few films deal with either the Hungarians or the Armenians - or any other old ""Soviet Block"" countries - and this tale deserved a better telling.

The grandmother, Helen, is soon arrested, and the baby is taken in by a childless couple, Jeno and Teri, who live in the countryside. Suzanne remains with her doting foster parents for six years, becoming as attached to them as if she was their own child. When Stalin finally dies, the grandmother is released, and soon removes Suzanne from her rural home and sends her alone to California to be reunited with the biological parents. After an initial fascination with American affluence, food and toys, Suzanne becomes deeply homesick. Her father makes a deal with her; try to accept life with the family and, when she is older, he promises to send her back to Hungary to visit the ""parents"" she pines for. The girl struggles at it for nine years, demonstrating increasing passive hostility towards her over-controlling mother, who wishes to protect her from the evils of the day, boys and cigarettes. (My, how times have changed!). Finally, after a confrontation between Suzanne and Margit that escalates to near violence while Peter is off on a business trip, Dad finally keeps his promise. What 15 year old Suzanne discovers back in Hungary is the crux of the story.All of the adult actors are superb: Nastassja Kinski (Margit), Tony Goldwyn (Peter), Agi Banfalvy (Helen), Zsusza Czinkoczi (Teri), and Balazs Galko (Jeno, with the engaging handlebar moustache). Scarlett Johanssen, who previously played the traumatized Grace Maclean in Robert Redford's THE HORSE WHISPERER, is again convincing as the emotionally tortured teenaged Suzanne. Above all, Kelly Endresz Banlaki is absolutely delightful as Suzanne's 6 year old persona.I was privileged to attend a private screening of AN AMERICAN RHAPSODY, after which &Eacute;va G&aacute;rdos answered questions from the audience. The film was based on her life and, yes, she really did do to her bedroom door what was depicted on the screen. And Kelly Banlaki was the last of several hundred children auditioned in Budapest during the Hungarian location shoot frantically completed over a few short weeks. G&aacute;rdos lovingly remembers her real-life foster parents, who died six months after her return ""home"". She's come to terms with her biological parents, and realizes that her life is richer for having been loved by both sets.AN AMERICAN RHAPSODY is a must-see contribution to this year's cinematic season - a quality three-hankie event for those who tear easily.

It begins with the young actress Scarlett Johansson, cast as Suzanne, standing on a bridge in Budapest. The year is 1965. &quot;I was 15 and my life was already falling apart,&quot; she says, &quot;so I came back to Hungary where it all began.&quot; What follows is an extended flashback to 1950. A married couple, Margit and Peter, played by Natassja Kinski and Tony Goldwyn, have to escape from Hungary. They have two young daughters and can only take the older one who is five years old. They have to leave the baby behind because it would be too dangerous if the baby cried. We see their escape and feel their tension -- bribing guards, running across a field, traveling in a train dressed as peasants. We see their love for their baby and the distress when they find out that their plans for having her smuggled out to join them in Vienna are thwarted. To save the baby, the Grandmother, played by Agnes Banafalvy, makes arrangements to have the baby raised by a childless peasant couple, Teri and Jeno, played by Zsuzsa Czinkoczi and Balazs Galko. They come to love the little girl as their own and she grows up loving them as well. In the meantime, the Margit and Peter and their older daughter arrive in America. They never stop trying to get their younger daughter out by writing letters to public officials. Finally, after six years, they obtain permission to bring their little girl to America.What follows is perhaps the strongest part of the film as the child who knows only the peasant family as her own and who doesn't speak a word of English, is suddenly taken from her idyllic childhood and thrust into a life in a small Los Angeles suburb. The young actress who plays the 6-year old Suzanne, Kelly Endresz-Banlaki is wonderful. I really felt the confusion and upset of the young child who misses her homeland and tries her best to adapt to her new life. These scenes are touching and mixed with comedy and pathos and I couldn't keep my tears from flowing. The scene suddenly shifts to nine years later. Suzanne is now a rebellious teenager in constant conflict with her mother. When she picks up a rifle and tries to shoot her way out of her locked bedroom, it is obvious she is in crisis. At her pleas, the family allow her to go back to visit Hungary.I enjoyed the film tremendously, felt emotion for each of the characters - the parents, the grandmother, the peasants who loved her, and even the older sister with her own form of sibling rivalry. Mostly though, I felt for the little six-year-old girl who had to adapt to a whole new way of life. The characters spoke both Hungarian and English, which added an authentic feel and the cinematography clearly depicted the contrasts between Los Angeles and Hungary. Throughout, there was also the feeling of the oppressive totalitarian system, which had divided the family. The ending was happy, although a little contrived, but it seemed appropriate. I can't think of any other way it could have ended.

How do you stand apart and objectify your own life and make it universal and therefore interesting and important for an audience to view?  The biggest trap I think would be to over-sentimentalize so that you turn your &quot;life&quot; into schmaltz.  &quot;An American Rhapsody&quot; is the story of a circa 1950's cold war Hungarian families escape from Russian rule to the USA leaving behind a child, Suzanne(Kelly Endresz-Banlaki as a child and Scarlett Johansson of &quot;Ghost World&quot; as a teenager) because she is too young and would cause un-needed attention by the Russian guards. The emotional focus, though is on Suzanne's story, as after 6 years and a number of circumstances, she is reunited with her parents in America.  But Suzanne is torn between 2 families:  her natural parents (Nastassja Kinski and Tony Goldwyn) and that of her foster parents who loved and raised her for those 6 years in Hungary.  The scenes in Hungary between Suzanne and her foster parents are the warmest of the entire film.  The biggest problem with &quot;American Rhapsody&quot; is that it doesn't get to the meat of the story, specifically sixteen year old Suzanne's story until the last 1/3 of the movie.  The other 2/3's of the film is exposition and plot development.  And it is here that Gardas should have used the pruning shears in the cutting room. The film feels lopsided, over plotted and over explained.  Scarlett Johnsson is so good and so real in the role of grown up Suzanne that we miss not seeing more of her story and the film suffers for it.  Gardas needed a strong, objective editor.  All in all though, &quot;American Rhapsody&quot; is truly heartfelt and we empathize and ultimately comprehend Gardas/Suzanne's plight and more importantly Gardas has stayed clear of the schmaltz.",3,Hungarian Rhapsody,997920000,"08 16, 2001",2001,1959,"['must', 'have', 'been', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'Eva', 'Gardas', 'director', 'quot', 'American', 'Rhapsody', 'quot', 'tell', 'particular', 'story', 'story', 'life', 'How', 'do', 'stand', 'apart', 'objectify', 'own', 'life', 'make', 'universal', 'therefore', 'interesting', 'important', 'audience', 'view', 'biggest', 'trap', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'over-sentimentalize', 'so', 'turn', 'quot', 'life', 'quot', 'schmaltz', 'quot', 'American', 'Rhapsody', 'quot', 'story', 'circa', '1950', 'cold', 'war', 'Hungarian', 'families', 'escape', 'Russian', 'rule', 'USA', 'leaving', 'child', 'Suzanne', 'Kelly', 'Endresz-Banlaki', 'child', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'quot', 'Ghost', 'World', 'quot', 'teenager', 'too', 'young', 'would', 'cause', 'un-needed', 'attention', 'Russian', 'guards', 'emotional', 'focus', 'though', 'Suzanne', 'story', '6', 'years', 'number', 'circumstances', 'reunited', 'parents', 'America', 'Suzanne', 'torn', '2', 'families', 'natural', 'parents', 'Nastassja', 'Kinski', 'Tony', 'Goldwyn', 'foster', 'parents', 'who', 'loved', 'raised', '6', 'years', 'Hungary', 'scenes', 'Hungary', 'Suzanne', 'foster', 'parents', 'are', 'warmest', 'entire', 'film', 'biggest', 'problem', 'quot', 'American', 'Rhapsody', 'quot', ""n't"", 'get', 'meat', 'story', 'specifically', 'sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'Suzanne', 'story', 'last', '1/3', 'movie', 'other', '2/3', 'film', 'exposition', 'plot', 'development', 'here', 'Gardas', 'should', 'have', 'used', 'pruning', 'shears', 'cutting', 'room', 'film', 'feels', 'lopsided', 'plotted', 'explained', 'Scarlett', 'Johnsson', 'so', 'good', 'so', 'real', 'role', 'grown', 'up', 'Suzanne', 'miss', 'not', 'seeing', 'more', 'story', 'film', 'suffers', 'Gardas', 'needed', 'strong', 'objective', 'editor', 'quot', 'American', 'Rhapsody', 'quot', 'truly', 'heartfelt', 'empathize', 'ultimately', 'comprehend', 'Gardas/Suzanne', 'plight', 'more', 'importantly', 'Gardas', 'stayed', 'clear', 'schmaltz']",N/A

Margit and Peter Sandor abruptly decide to flee Communist Hungary in 1950, and in doing so leave behind their infant daughter, Zsuzsi. Their plan to reunite with her in the United States becomes complicated and Zsuzsi consequently remains in Hungary. She lives with Jeno (Balazs Galko) and Teri (Zsuzsa Czinoczi), a childless couple she believes to be her parents. Margit (Nastassja Kinksi) and Peter (Tony Goldwyn), who had initially taken their older daughter, Maria, send for Zsuzsi after five years to join them in Los Angeles. Life in 1955 LA is far removed from life in 1955 rural Hungary, and little Zsuzsi has a difficult time adjusting. Discover her fate by watching the remainder of this film. While nostalgic and well-acted, this film offers very little joy as a reward for watching. It begins with the depressing prospect of two parents leaving behind one of their two children and does not brighten at all for the duration. Scenes that should bring optimism, such as the reunification of the Sandor family, are wrought with such a sense of imminent gloom that the viewer is left with an uneasy feeling. First-time director, Eva Gardos, does a very good job with the sentimental and dramatic aspects of her story. I would rather, however, she had been less heavy-handed and had more fun with the lighter episodes. This could have been a fantastic film, yet emerges as merely good.

A Hungarian girl Suzanne is left behind the Iron Curtain when her parents (Nastassia Kinski and Tony Goldwyn) and elder sister escaped the country. Six years later they manage to meet again in America, but Suzanne finds her relation with her mother in the Promised Land is strained and painful.`An American Rhapsody' received mixed reviews from the critics, and while some are impressed with the strength of the real-life events depicted in the film, and love the credible atmosphere of the 50s, others think the film needs more original content and effective telling of the story.I confess I was disappointed with the film partly because I was led to believe that the film stars Scarlett Johansson. Though it is true that Ms Johansson plays the grown-up Suzanne, you have to wait almost for one hour to see her and what she can do. And there is not much time left for her to be in character because the film fails to explore the conflict between the mother and the daughter. Suzanne lacks depth that should have been in the real-life counterpart.The problem is the film's structure. Even those who loved it would admit the film could be better by NOT showing some parts of the earlier section. &Eacute;va G&aacute;rdos spends considerable time retelling how the family fled the country in black-and white images, but the escape scenes somehow are bland, as if borrowed from somewhere else. This is understandable for after all she didn't experience the escape itself. What she experienced is, according to the film's content, the quiet life with kind Hungarian foster parents, but curiously we are not allowed to know these Hungarian people very much, and this only weakens the power of the story.`American Rhapsody' has a strong story, but this story needs better telling. And by better telling I mean the land of Hungary and its people, which remains very shadowy place all through the film, but must be a significant meaning to Suzanne.
