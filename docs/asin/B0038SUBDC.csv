The series had went into syndication by the time I was old enough understand what it was about. And by that time, the 1960's was already burning! I guess I shouldn't have used the word faux in my title for this review. Because there were partsof America that was like the fictional town of Mayfield . No Blacks, no Hispanics, Arabs, Jews and Asian. No divorced working mothers, and especially no Un-Married mothers. Feminist women or Openly Gay men!It was a very clean and milk-white depiction of America. I know that the creators of the series said that it was based on the day to day lives and anticsof their own children. Unfortunetly they were unable to convey this concept to the audience of the time. Fifty years later, this same audience, Now grown up, grown old and leading today's Far Right and Tea Party movements. Like to hold up ""LITB"" as some sort of panacea of how America was and should be again. They like to forgetthat LITB was a ""FICTIONAL"" TV show. And was never intended to be a portrait of America!As for the show. It is, and was a pure delight in episodic story telling. I agree with another reviewer that the ensemble cast was perfect. I spent manya wonderful Saturday afternoons watching LITB with a balony and mayo sandwich, a glass of Krammel Milk and a plate of Salerno Butter Cookies in front ofmy parents old Zenith BW TV.It would've been interesting, if the show had of stayed on a few more years. Showing how Beaver dealt with his turn at being a teenager. Or how Wallygot along in College. Perhaps becoming more reflective of the times. Wally being drafted. The Vietnam War. Beaver and his parents views on the Civil Rights Movement. Perhaps and episode dealing with Eddie Haskell coming out of the Closet!

I too hope the The New Leave It To Beaver is also on the list of possible future releases, as well as the early 80's Still The Beaver which aired on The Disney Channel not long after it's launch. To me, that new Beaver was better. The storylines were more realistic than the later New Leave It To Beaver, but still, all 3 shows represent one timelessly classic family that you just can't help loving. For me, my favorite four families in all of television history are the Cleavers, The Stones (Donna Reed Show)the Huxtables (Cosby Show) and the Taylors (Home Improvement).All 4, unlike any other family series, feature families we just love seeing again and again, watching the same episodes over and over, never tiring of their exploits and pitfalls. Hopefully that type of feeling isn't completely gone, but it's been a long while since Home Improvement wrapped up, and no new series has shown such promise. It's ok though, we're finally going to be able to revel in every zany mishap of Beaver's original run, and that sure makes up for any shortcomings of today's tv offerings.

(With a very minor ""but""; details below)DVD Distributor -- Shout! Factory (The set is copyrighted by NBC Universal)---------------------------------------------------On June 29, 2010, a very pleasant thing happened -- something that many people probably didn't think would ever happen in their lifetime -- the audio and video company ""Shout! Factory"" released to the public ""LEAVE IT TO BEAVER: THE COMPLETE SERIES"", a spectacular 37-Disc DVD collection that includes all 234 episodes of what I consider to be one of the best and most rewatchable television series of all-time.And Shout! has treated The Beav with expert care too, make no mistake about that fact. These 234 shows (plus the pilot episode, entitled ""It's A Small World"", which is also included in this mega-set) look and sound fantastic on these DVDs. All of the episodes were filmed in black-and-white, and the restored B&W; prints that are presented in this collection are sensational.To quote Brian Ward, the producer of this DVD boxed set:""These episodes are complete and look better than you've ever seen them before. They've been restored and remastered from the original film elements. I've honestly never seen 50s television look this good. For those that bought the original seasons 1 & 2 released a couple years ago, these are leagues above those transfers. They really are something."" -- Brian Ward of Shout! Factory; January 27, 2010These shows do, indeed, look gorgeous on these DVDs, but I will add this note about the video quality --- The majority of the episodes in Season 1 and Season 2 of this set appear to me to have pretty close to the same video quality as the Universal DVD releases of those two seasons which came out in November 2005 and May 2006 [Season 1;Season 2].Those two Universal sets have pretty good overall picture quality too, but most of the scenes that were filmed indoors are peppered with an abundance of grain. The scenes shot outdoors, however, look perfect and free of almost all grain.This Shout! set mirrors those Universal video characteristics for the first two seasons, with the indoors footage being speckled with much more film grain than is found in any of the last four seasons. There are exceptions to this though, with one exception being the first-year episode ""Brotherly Love"", which looks quite a bit better in this Shout! set than it does in the 2005 Universal release, with less grain visible in the Shout! version.Some of the shows from Season 1 also look darker on the Shout! DVDs when compared to the Universal edition (particularly the episode ""Captain Jack""). So it would certainly seem as though Shout! has not used the exact same prints of the shows that Universal worked with in 2005.But once I got to Season 3 of this Shout! set -- WOW! Simply magnificent in all respects! Almost all of the grain in every episode has been completely eliminated for the final four seasons. It's remarkable how blemish-free these new high-definition DVD prints look. Almost as if they were filmed yesterday. They look that good.The highest praise I can muster goes to the Shout! people for taking the time and effort to do this classic TV sitcom the ""DVD justice"" it richly deserves.One of the things that I immediately noticed when watching some of the episodes from Seasons 3 through 6 (which were filmed after the Cleavers moved into their new house on Pine Street in Mayfield) was the chair in the living room, the one in which dad Ward Cleaver is often seen sitting while reading the newspaper.The chair's bold and unique fabric looks particularly bright on these remastered DVDs. The pattern practically jumps right off the screen, illustrating just how superb these DVD transfers really are. It might even be a good idea to wear sunglasses when watching those living-room scenes from now on. :)Each episode is presented complete and uncut, just as they were originally aired on network television in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The average length per episode is about 25 minutes and 45 seconds.A few episodes clock in at about 24:55. But then there are still others that exceed 26 minutes. So, I think it's probably safe to say that these episodes are just about as complete as we're ever going to get.And Shout! DVD producer Brian Ward has also assured fans that all of the episodes in this set are uncut -- ""The episodes are complete"" were Mr. Ward's exact words on May 26, 2010 (via a post Brian made at the Shout! Factory Community Forum).There is, however, one small section of one episode that is missing. And I'd be willing to bet that it's missing by pure accident. It's the preview (or ""teaser"") that was originally aired at the very beginning of the episode ""The Black Eye"". That short preview, narrated by Hugh Beaumont (which is when we hear Hugh say, ""And that's our story tonight on Leave It To Beaver""), is nowhere to be found in this Shout!  set. It is there, however, in the Universal 2005 DVD set.The reason I said it's missing by ""accident"" is because of the way the order of most of the show openings for Season One have been rearranged. The short preview scenes that were part of the first-year episodes were (I think) originally aired PRIOR to the opening titles. That's the way they are presented in the 2005 Universal DVD set anyway.But in this Shout! set, the majority of the preview clips are shown AFTER the opening credits. There are seven exceptions, however. The following seven episodes are presented as they originally aired, with the teaser coming prior to the opening titles: ""Music Lesson"", ""The Perfect Father"", ""The State Vs. Beaver"", ""Beaver Runs Away"", ""Party Invitation"", ""The Bank Account"", and ""Lonesome Beaver"".This is a real mystery to me. I can't figure out why in the world the people who were responsible for remastering these episodes would have decided to reverse the order of the teasers and opening credits for about 80% of the first-season episodes in seemingly willy-nilly fashion, while choosing at the same time to leave the teasers where they should be in the first place (at the very beginning of the show) on 7 of the 39 episodes. It doesn't make a bit of sense. It almost looks like somebody at NBC Universal was being deliberately spiteful.~big shrug~Anyway, my guess would be that when someone was fiddling around with the chronology of most of these show-opening segments, somehow the preview/teaser clip for the ""Black Eye"" episode was never re-inserted and was inadvertently cut out completely.Here's another oddity that I noticed about the first-season previews -- In this Shout! set, the preview segment for the episode ""Brotherly Love"" is completely different from the one that can be found on the 2005 DVD. The narration by Hugh Beaumont is identical in both DVD versions, but the video is totally different. Weird, huh? I had no idea that more than one preview segment existed for any of the episodes in Season 1. (It kind of makes the 2005 Universal DVD set for the first season of LITB seem a tad more valuable now, since there's something unique about a portion of it.)-------------------------------------------THE SHOW:""Leave It To Beaver"" premiered on CBS-TV on Friday, October 4, 1957, and continued on network television for a total of six seasons, finishing up in 1963. Each of the six seasons consisted of exactly 39 episodes, a hefty number when compared to current seasonal standards.CBS carried the show for the first season only. For the final five years, ""Beaver"" was a part of the ABC-TV schedule.The LITB storylines were always very simple and uncomplicated, which is probably a big reason why it is so charming and appealing. No major earth-shattering disasters ever befall the Cleavers. Nobody ever gets hurt (except an occasional scraped knee), the parents (Ward and June) rarely fight about anything serious and never threaten to leave each other, and above all, these characters really seemed to care about each other, without getting too sappy about it.All of the above-mentioned traits helped make ""Leave It To Beaver"" what it was each week in 1957, and what I believe it remains today: a good, clean, fun, uncomplicated half-hour of entertaining television.Starring Jerry Mathers as Theodore (Beaver) Cleaver, Tony Dow as his brother Wally, Barbara Billingsley as June, and Hugh Beaumont as Ward, the excellent cast of ""Leave It To Beaver"" was a well-chosen group in my opinion.While it's true, I suppose, that the acting was a bit on the ""stiff"" side on many occasions, I still think that this ensemble did quite well on this show. A sense of true believability and realism finds its way quite comfortably into each of these episodes.Toss into this cast grouping the very funny Richard Deacon, who portrayed Ward's friend and co-worker, Fred Rutherford, plus Ken Osmond as the ever-sarcastic Eddie Haskell, Frank Bank as Clarence ""Lumpy"" Rutherford, Rusty Stevens as Larry Mondello, and all of Beaver's and Wally's other various friends, classmates, and schoolteachers, and you've got a really first-rate supporting cast of characters to build stories around.Right out of the gate in Season 1, a whole bunch of top-notch episodes are on tap, with some of my favorites from the first year being: ""The Black Eye"", ""Tenting Tonight"", ""Beaver's Short Pants"", ""Party Invitation"", ""The Bank Account"", ""Train Trip"", ""The Perfect Father"", ""Beaver Runs Away"", and my #1 fave from the rookie season, ""The Haircut"", which has Beaver getting scalped by barber Wally in one of the funniest episodes of the whole series.There's also the funny ""Captain Jack"" episode -- which was the very first show to be filmed; but was the second program to be aired. ""Captain Jack"" has Wally and Beaver sending away for a pet alligator, and includes the very funny scene where Minerva (the maid who is never seen again in the series) comes running up the basement stairs screaming ""Help! A monster! There's an alligator in the basement!"" .... This is followed by Ward's skeptical -- ""An alligator?!"" (LOL.)""Captain Jack"" also has the distinction of being the very first episode in television history to show a toilet on screen. (The ""tank"" portion of the Cleaver toilet is shown, not the [~gasp!~] ""bowl"" itself.) :-)In fact, it was the ""toilet"" scene in ""Captain Jack"" that kept that episode from being aired by CBS as the debut show of the series in late 1957. But LITB show executives, including writers Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher (who authored a great number of the episodes during LITB's six-year history, including ""Captain Jack""), stuck by their guns and won the ""toilet battle"" with CBS bigwigs, and thus ""Captain Jack"" (toilet scene intact) was approved for network broadcast one week later, being aired on October 11, 1957, as Leave It To Beaver episode #2.And yet another winning Season-One entry is entitled simply ""Lumpy Rutherford"" -- where we get our first look at Clarence Rutherford, known to most people as ""Lumpy"" (or ""The Lump""). You'll note how Lumpy goes from being one of Wally's feared enemies to one of his best friends as the series progresses.As mentioned, the original ""Leave It To Beaver"" pilot episode (""It's A Small World""), which originally aired on April 23, 1957, has also been included in this Shout! set. It was first aired as an installment of the syndicated anthology program ""Studio 57"". And it's a darn good pilot too, in my opinion, with a good storyline (unlike a lot of other series-launching pilots).I know that a lot of people don't particularly like the Beaver pilot very much, but I myself think it's a pretty good show, which does a nice job of introducing the series and the characters. I actually find myself returning to watch this pilot show quite a bit.I will say, though, that it would have been nice if Hugh Beaumont could have been included in the pilot's cast too. His presence would certainly have made it a better program, to be sure. Because Hugh's portrayal of Ward Cleaver will live on forever as one of the top ""TV dad"" performances there ever was.Both Barbara Billingsley and Jerry Mathers co-star in the ""Small World"" pilot, but different actors played the parts of Wally and Ward. Paul Sullivan portrayed Wally and Casey Adams (aka Max Showalter) filled Ward's shoes.A 13-year-old Harry Shearer (famed voice actor on ""The Simpsons"") also was featured in the cast of the pilot episode. It's a small part for Shearer, but he was very good as ""Frankie Bennett"", an Eddie Haskell-like smart-aleck. I was impressed by the naturalness of Harry's performance.LITB veterans Richard Deacon and Diane Brewster are also part of the ""Small World"" cast, although not in the same roles that they ended up playing in the series. Deacon's part, in fact, is a fairly extensive one, as an executive for the ""Franklin Milk Company"".Some of my other favorite episodes from Seasons 2 through 6 are listed below. You'll notice a preponderance of episodes centering on Wally here, especially in Seasons 5 and 6. The shows that focused primarily on Wally and his friends in the latter years of the series are, in my view, a tad bit better than the ""Beaver""-oriented shows from those same seasons.The writers/producers of the series, Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher, obviously realized that Tony Dow was becoming somewhat of a teen heartthrob, and therefore wrote many episodes featuring Wally as the center of attention during the last two or three seasons:Season 2 --- ""Happy Weekend"", ""Wally's Haircomb"", ""The Shave"", ""Wally's New Suit"", and ""Most Interesting Character"".Season 3 --- ""Teacher Comes To Dinner"", ""Beaver Takes A Bath"", ""Larry Hides Out"", ""Ward's Baseball"", and ""Beaver Takes A Walk"".Season 4 --- ""Eddie Spends The Night"", ""In The Soup"", ""Beaver Won't Eat"", ""Wally And Dudley"", and ""Chuckie's New Shoes"".Season 5 --- ""Wally's Car"", ""Wally's Chauffeur"", ""Wally's Big Date"", ""Wally Stays At Lumpy's"", and ""Beaver's Long Night"".Season 6 --- ""Wally's Dinner Date"", ""Wally's Practical Joke"", ""The All-Night Party"", ""Wally's License"", and ""Wally's Car Accident"".-------------------------------------------DVD BONUS MATERIAL:Shout! Factory has produced an entire disc of supplemental bonus material for this monster-sized DVD collection, and there's some very good stuff in here too. Let's have a gander:>>> ""It's A Small World"" -- The original ""Leave It To Beaver"" pilot episode (discussed earlier). Running time: 25:07.>>> ""Forever The Beaver: The Cleavers Look Back"" -- This is a 74-minute featurette made in 2005, with some of the cast members from the show (Jerry Mathers, Tony Dow, and Barbara Billingsley) looking back on the series. Also featured in this bonus is Brian Levant, one of the co-creators of ""The New Leave It To Beaver"" (aka ""Still The Beaver"") TV series, which aired in the 1980s.>>> ""Ken Osmond And Frank Bank Remember"" -- This featurette, which was made in April 2010, allows us to visit with two members of the LITB cast who weren't part of the ""Forever The Beaver"" program -- Ken Osmond and Frank Bank. Running time: 29:54.>>> ""The Drum Major Of The Toy Parade: A Conversation With Dave Kahn"" -- Dave Kahn, the composer of the LITB theme song, is interviewed. Kahn was 94 at the time of this very brief interview. He passed away in July 2008. The person conducting this interview is Tony Dow. And Tony makes a mistake when he says that Kahn's theme song (entitled ""The Toy Parade"") was jazzed up in the third season of the LITB series. But it wasn't until the sixth and final year of the show that the ""jazzing up"" of Mr. Kahn's famous theme song was done for the opening and closing credits. The length of this bonus supplement is 3:16.>>> U.S. Treasury Film -- This bonus is sort of a ""mini"" episode of ""Leave It To Beaver"". It was produced during the third season of the series, in  cooperation with the United States Treasury Department. Beaver learns a valuable lesson about saving money in this rarely-seen 15-minute advertisement for U.S. Savings Bonds. This program hasn't been restored or remastered like the other episodes in this set, so the video quality is a little rough around the edges. It also doesn't include a laugh track, and the absence of such a track here serves to emphasize the importance and necessity of the ""canned"" laughs that we hear throughout all of the regular episodes in this series. Because after hearing an episode without any laughs at all, it becomes painfully obvious that those laughs coming from a ""canned"" audience are definitely better than hearing dead silence instead.>>> Original Promos -- Two ABC-TV promotional ads for LITB. Some episode clips from various seasons of the show are included in these two brief television ads. And watch out for an alternate take of a scene from the fifth-season episode ""Wally's Weekend Job"". When Wally is getting chewed out by Mary Ellen Roger's father, LITB aficionados will instantly be able to tell that the dialogue being spoken is from a different take of that scene which ended up on the cutting-room floor. The picture quality for these ABC promos is really terrible. No cleaning up of this material was done at all (which is understandable, since these TV ads are merely a bonus anyway). But when watching how these promos have deteriorated as they have, it makes you appreciate the exceptional quality of the episodes in this set. The running time for these two promos is 2:01.>>> Another cool bonus included in this collector's set is a very unique and rare item -- a replica of an original board game called the ""Leave It To Beaver Money Maker Game"". The paper replica of the game comes folded and tucked underneath the tabs that are affixed to the inside front cover of the slim plastic case reserved for the ""Bonus Features"".>>> DVD Trailers -- A collection of promo spots for some other TV-on-DVD sets marketed by Shout! Factory. These same promos/trailers are also on Disc 1 of each of the six seasons in this LITB set (but they can easily be skipped on those six discs by pressing the Menu button).More --- In addition to the full disc of extra stuff, there are also six radio shows included in this massive DVD set too (one show per individual season set). These radio programs all come from ""Shokus Internet Radio"" and are all episodes of ""Stu's Show"", which is an online program hosted by Stu Shostak. Stu is the owner and operator of Shokus Video and Shokus Internet Radio.Shostak's show regularly features guests from the world of 1950s and 1960s television, including several shows with ""Leave It To Beaver"" cast members, six of which can be found scattered throughout this DVD mega-set. Most of the radio programs in this set are pretty lengthy too, running for about 1 hour and 45 minutes each.-------------------------------------------THE PACKAGING:The packaging that Shout! has put together for this LITB Complete Series set is very nicely done, adding just one more element of ""near perfection"" to this outstanding DVD release.The outer slipcase box is fairly thick and sturdy, and it looks cool too. The way Beaver seems to be snagging ""The Complete Series"" with his fishing pole is a clever design.Each of the six individual seasons has its own case, with all six seasons then sliding comfortably (but not too tightly) inside the outer slipcase box. The one disc full of bonus material is housed in a separate plastic ""slim"" case.The individual season cases are standard-sized (half-inch wide) Amaray type plastic keepcases, which means that this set has a fairly small overall footprint on your shelf (considering there are 234 episodes, plus a disc of extras, contained in this box). The total width of the whole package is just a shade under 4 inches.The discs in each of the six seasonal cases (which are all single-sided! Yay!) are colorful and are arranged nicely too, in that the DVDs don't overlap one another at all. There are two swinging ""leaf"" pages hinged to the center of each plastic case, with each of these pages holding two discs (one on each side of the page/leaf). Discs 1 and 6 are attached to trays that rest in the front and back covers of the case.Each of the seasons features a different promotional picture on the front of the plastic case and on the six discs within that set.A 12-page booklet is included for each of the six individual seasonal sets, which is kind of a ""bonus"" unto itself, since a lot of DVD products have gone ""paperless"" entirely nowadays.The six booklets, like the rest of this collection, are attractive and nicely put together too, with information about all 39 episodes for each individual season, including writing and director credits, show descriptions, and original airdates for each episode. Plus, the booklets are sprinkled with a few LITB publicity photos too.-------------------------------------------THE MENUS:The menu structure for these DVDs is pretty simple and non-gimmicky, which is always a good thing (IMO). All of the menus are laid out in a ""wet cement"" fashion, giving the impression that all of the words on the screen have been written in wet cement (to mimic the opening titles from Season 1 of the series).The main menu and all of the sub-menus have the LITB theme music playing in the background, and it plays on a continuous loop. I'd prefer silent menus myself, or possibly a one-time playing of the music and then silence.Each disc's main menu is adorned with various promotional pictures taken from the individual season contained on that disc.There are sub-menus for ""Episodes"" and ""Bonus Feature"". The ""Bonus Feature"" option only appears on Disc #1 for each season (the single bonus item on those discs is one of the radio shows mentioned previously). There are 6 or 7 episodes per disc.All discs include a ""Play All Episodes"" option. From the main menu, this continuous playback feature is simply labeled ""Play"". From the Episodes sub-menu, it's listed as ""Play All"".A few chapter breaks have been inserted for each episode, and they are nicely placed, including a break right after the opening credits, which is always a good place to put a chapter stop, IMO, allowing a quick bypass of the main titles in order to get right to the beginning of an episode.-------------------------------------------FINAL THOUGHTS:""Leave It To Beaver"" is an American institution. Although extremely simple and unsophisticated in nature, the show never fails to entertain.What other television show could possibly produce entire half-hour episodes that revolve around nothing more than getting a ring stuck on your finger, or buying a new suit, or writing a grade-school poem....and yet make these seemingly mundane occurrences come out so charming and realistic on our TV screens?Not many shows could accomplish this task as nicely and skillfully as ""Leave It To Beaver"" managed to do.This 37-Disc set is a little like placing a piece of mid-20th-century Americana right into your living room. And having the whole series in one box is enough to make any Beaver fan do a few cartwheels.I think possibly the thing I treasure the most about having all 234 ""Leave It To Beaver"" episodes in my DVD library is being able to revisit Mayfield and the Cleaver gang anytime of the day or night by simply popping in one of these discs. Knowing that I can do that is kind of a comforting thought all by itself.David Von PeinJune/July 2010",5,"THE HOLY ""BEAVER"" GRAIL",1277769600,"06 29, 2010",2010,23661,"['QUICK', 'DVD', 'STATS',

Only two seasons had been released for many years, but now Shout! Factory is issuing Season Three through Six individually, with One and Two to follow, as well as the new complete series deluxe boxed set.The Complete Series box contains an bonus disc with the unaired pilot (which did not feature Tony Dow or Hugh Beaumont and included a young Harry Shearer), a public service film, promos, a vintage board game and two new documentaries: one feature length that focuses on the principals and the show's history and another at featurette length about the supporting cast, particularly Eddie and Lumpy.The feature video is documentary-style, fairly straightforward and benefits greatly from the presence of Barbara Billingsley, Jerry Mathers and Tony Dow, the latter two being involved behind the scenes as well (Mathers' brother Jimmy directed).The second video, produced and directed by Shostak, takes a more whimsical approach. What fan of ""Leave it to Beaver"" wouldn't want to see Ken ""Eddie"" Osmond and Frank ""Lumpy"" Bank give each other ""the business?"" If they just talked ""straight"" through, it would not have been as true to the two characters and the actors who, as evidenced on the ""Stu's Show"" interviews included on the individual discs.The clips in this segment are exactly the best clips to showcase Eddie and Lumpy. To someone who loves the show, like I do, as soon as each clip came on I laughed, ""Oh! I love that episode!"" It struck just the right chords.[Perhaps no other single broadcast has been able to contribute more material to a classic TV series DVD collection than Stu's Show on shokus internet radio. You can also hear Alan Young and Connie Hines, the latter in her last interview in the bonus features of Mister Ed (Young on Season One; Young and Hines on Season Two).]""Leave it to Beaver"" is a landmark show in pop culture history, not because it broke new ground or was particularly innovative, but because it honed in on the life of kids, their relationships with adults and the odd moments of life that still and will always resound, regardless of changing styles and technical inroads.If you remember it, revisit it afresh. If you have kids, by all means make it part of their lives too. If you don't have kids, it will strike a chord with the kid inside. There's something special about it.",5,Leave it to Shout!

This little show is iconic from a standpoint of Television History, and a picture of the values and ideas of certain parts of America in the 1950s and early 60s.This little show had a lot going for it.  First, it debuted in 1957 when TV was just starting to reach out into Suburban and rural America.  And this show, along with others like &#34;Mr. Ed&#34;, and &#34;Lassie&#34; showed everyone what middle class white America looked like.  This had huge ramifications then as the idea of &#34;middle class&#34; was a revolutionary idea, and now as we look at how it all began.I love the characters in this series, especially the kids.  Jerry Mathers and Tony Dow are great child actors who played off each other wonderfully.  The parents played by Barbara Billingsly and Hugh Beaumont were the perfect picture of what parents were supposed to be, to the point of becoming a clich&eacute;.I love the wholesomeness of this show.  You can watch it with the kids or grandkids, and it will keep their attention as well as reinforce family values.What makes this show groundbreaking is that while in the 21st century we see sitcom shows come and go all the time, during the era that wasn't the case at all.  The only sitcom shows of equal greatness that preceded Beaver were &#34;The Honeymooners&#34; and &#34;I love Lucy&#34;.  Beaver was truly at the forefront of modern TV episodic storytelling.  Also, and perhaps most importantly, all the shows of that time were focused on the adults, BUT, Beaver instead looked at the lives of the children and made them the focus, something no one ever had done before, and became the forerunner to shows like Lassie, The Brady Bunch, and many others classic greats.This is a great series that would be a great addition to any family.**Interesting facts** Hugh Beaumont the father of the show was also an ordained minister.  Also, in the 80s the show was resurrected with a sequel show called &#34;The New Leave it to Beaver&#34;, that followed the family all grown up(with the exception of Beaumont who died in the 70s.  You would be hard pressed to find  this show anywhere today.  The word is, and Austrailian company bought the rights to the show, but then folded leaving the rights in limbo.

1333262,A28V2CQXWPXIR0,B0038SUBDC,Kert Conrad,"[6, 7]","After struggling to watch the trouble-plagued DVD's of LEAVE IT TO BEAVER released by Universal a few years back, it's great to see that Shout! Factory has come to the rescue and produced a beautifully packaged set of the COMPLETE series.  So far I've only checked out a few episodes from Season 3, but everything I've seen looks and sounds fantastic.  At last, one of the best TV shows of all time has been given the top-notch treatment it deserves on DVD.As for the series itself, I'd like to offer a few comments about the show's strengths and weaknesses.  First off, I'll have to say that BEAVER was probably better than any series in TV history at creating a believable town. The writers did a great job of establishing and consistently referring to local sites such as Metzger's Field, Friends Lake, Miller's Pond and so on.  The frequent use of outdoor scenes also added much to the believability.Other viewers have commented about the series having a lot of charm, and this is certainly true.  The things that stand out for me personally are not the plots or the acting, but rather the simple moments showing the kids just being kids: Wally and the gang playing basketball in the driveway, Beaver waiting for his father to get home from work, the boys daydreaming about how they would spend a million dollars. These are things I remember experiencing in my own childhood, and the series did a marvelous job of capturing the essence of youthful innocence.On the negative side, sometimes I wish the writers and actors had loosened up a bit.  The characters (adults and kids alike) often seem a little TOO well behaved and proper, and the dialogue tends to be a little stiff.  What's most annoying, though, are the constant, anything-but-subtle messages about parenting and child behavior.  The series could almost have been called LESSONS FOR YOUNG PARENTS, given the number of stories that end with Ward and June talking about how they could have better handled their latest family problem.There are quite a few good episodes in the first two seasons (""Beaver Runs Away"" and ""Happy Weekend"" come to mind), but in my opinion the series reached its peak in its third year.  The writers and cast really had things down to perfection in Year 3.  Towards the end of the fourth season the show started to lose some of its freshness, mainly because Jerry Mathers was growing up and naturally beginning to lose his little-boy charm.  Also, the characters of Ward and June turned closer to being caricatures in the final seasons, always being flawlessly groomed and speaking perfect English.Random thoughts...It's kind of hard to tell just how big a place Mayfield is supposed to be.  Sometimes it seems like a small town (as when Beaver visits old Gus at the fire station), but other times (as with scenes of the busy downtown area and the upscale sporting goods store) it seems like a pretty good-sized city.The pilot, ""It's A Small World"", is kind of eerie to watch.  It's almost as if you're looking at the Cleaver family in an alternate universe.  At first glance everything seems about the same, but then you start to notice familiar faces with different names, and vice versa. Spooky!  It's interesting to note that in the pilot Mr. Cleaver is shown SMOKING (hard to imagine Hugh Beaumont as Ward puffing away on a cigarette while talking to his wife). Also, in the pilot Wally and Beaver seem to be looked upon as outcasts rather than popular kids: both of them are referred to as being ""creeps"" by the other boys.Tony Dow's lack of acting experience is pretty evident in the very early episodes.  However, he improved rapidly, and by the end of the series he was probably the most natural actor in the cast.  In fact, during the final two seasons the best episodes were those centering around Wally, not Beaver.It's kind of funny when you think about it, but the Cleavers were, to put it bluntly, ultra-square.  After all, the series was produced during the heyday of the early rock `n roll era, but Wally and his pals went to formal dances, wore suits and ties, and never did anything wilder than the cha-cha.  Apparently those Chuck Berry and Elvis Presley records never made it to the music stores in Mayfield!BEAVER was produced in a time when gender roles were pretty rigidly enforced.  In one episode Beav is invited to an all-girl party and has a miserable time until he sneaks off to a room filled with hunting trophies and guns -- in other words, the things a HE-MAN should like.  (On a side note, the little girl's father in that segment is played by Lyle Talbot, who was a fairly big movie star in the 1930's.)  Elsewhere in the first season, Wally is eager to enroll in a military academy where the biggest attraction is that all the teachers are MEN.Even with its shortcomings, though, LEAVE IT TO BEAVER still stands as one of television's all-time top comedies, and its blend of gentle wisdom and low-key humor will certainly keep audiences laughing for years to come.  In today's entertainment world of wretched excess and cheap laughs, it's certainly a welcome treat.",5,"Knowing Ward, Knowing June, There Is Nothing Beav Can Do...",1279152000,"07 15,

1333270,AIVWYHNOME34I,B0038SUBDC,M. De Sapio,"[0, 0]","Fifty years after he left the air, we still love the Beav.  Leave it to Beaver is such an utterly charming show, such a fixture of our culture, that to write a review of it seems superfluous.  Yet in a way the show's proverbial status works against it.  Most  Americans ages 8 to 80 know the show's archetypes - Beaver Cleaver the all-American Every-Kid, Eddie Haskell the two-faced schemer, Ward Cleaver the all-knowing father,  June Cleaver the perfect stay-at-home mom - but fewer know the actual series in all its detail.  Jerry Mathers in an interview several years ago compared Leave it to Beaver to a medieval morality play; an equally apt comparison would be to the moralizing paintings of Pieter Breughel and Jan Steen.  Especially Breughelesque is the way that the childhood vices of Beaver's and Wally's friends are replicated in the adult world - Fred Rutherford is Eddie Haskell in a gray flannel suit, for example.  Yet ""Beaver"" deftly avoids both preachiness and sentimentality.  Even today, the jokes are droll, ironic and secretly wise.  A typical exchange, when Beaver and Wally discover a bottle of whiskey in their garage:Beaver: It smells awful! Why do people drink it?Wally:  It's like when grown-ups have a party.  They drink it to have a good time.Beaver: Gee, if it's a party, don't they have a good time anyway?Wally: Well, grown-ups have a harder time having a good time than kids do.What I find most remarkable about the writing on Leave it to Beaver, when compared to other sitcoms of the era, is the complete absence of vaudeville-type humor.  ""Beaver"" could veritably be called high comedy in the sense that the jokes usually turn on subtleties of language rather than slapstick.  The jokes are universal because their topic is human nature with all its foibles.  And BEAVER is a superlative artistic production; the crisp black-and-white cinematography, with lighting that conjures up an eternal mid-May, looks smashing in Shout Factory's restored prints.  The writing, as I said, is exceptional and the characterizations of the principal cast are perfection.  Season 1 was a warm-up season (I'll bet many will agree with me that the 12-year-old Wally and Eddie were mere shadows of their later selves); by Season 2 the series was in full-gear, and it along with Seasons 3 and 4 represent the show's peak years.  By the last two seasons, Beaver had grown out of being a cute little kid and the writers were now challenged with finding more mature situations for both him and Wally; in many instances, they succeeded.  But there are great episodes in every season of LEAVE IT TO BEAVER, so you should have no qualms about buying the complete set.  It will provide endless laughs, pleasure, nostalgia.",5,Why We Still Love the Beaver,1375920000,"08 8, 2013",2013,2731,"['Fifty', 'years', 'left', 'air', 'still', 'love', 'Beav', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'such', 'utterly', 'charming', 'show', 'fixture', 'culture', 'write', 'review', 'superfluous', 'way', 'show', 'proverbial', 'status', 'Most', 'Americans', '8', '80', 'know', 'show', 'archetypes', 'Beaver', 'Cleaver', 'all-American', 'Every-Kid', 'Eddie', 'Haskell', 'two-faced', 'schemer', 'Ward', 'Cleaver', 'all-knowing', 'father', 'June', 'Cleaver', 'perfect', 'stay-at-home', 'mom', 'fewer', 'know', 'actual', 'series', 'detail', 'Jerry', 'Mathers', 'interview', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'compared', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'medieval', 'morality', 'play', 'equally', 'apt', 'comparison', 'would', 'be', 'moralizing', 'paintings', 'Pieter', 'Breughel', 'Jan', 'Steen', 'Especially', 'Breughelesque', 'way', 'childhood', 'vices', 'Beaver', 'Wally', 'friends', 'are', 'replicated', 'adult', 'world', 'Fred', 'Rutherford', 'Eddie', 'Haskell', 'gray', 'flannel', 'suit', 'example', 'Beaver', 'deftly', 'preachiness', 'sentimentality', 'Even', 'today', 'jokes', 'are', 'droll', 'ironic', 'secretly', 'wise', 'A', 'typical', 'exchange', 'when', 'Beaver', 'Wally', 'discover', 'bottle', 'whiskey', 'garage', 'Beaver', 'awful', 'Why', 'do', 'people', 'drink', 'Wally', 'when', 'grown-ups', 'have', 'party', 'drink', 'have', 'good', 'time.Beaver', 'Gee', 'party', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'good', 'time', 'anyway', 'Wally', 'Well', 'grown-ups', 'have', 'harder', 'time', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'kids', 'find', 'most', 'remarkable', 'writing', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'when', 'compared', 'other', 'sitcoms', 'era', 'complete', 'absence', 'vaudeville-type', 'humor', 'Beaver', 'could', 'veritably', 'be', 'called', 'high', 'comedy', 'sense', 'jokes', 'usually', 'turn', 'subtleties', 'language', 'rather', 'slapstick', 'jokes', 'are', 'universal', 'topic', 'human', 'nature', 'foibles', 'BEAVER', 'superlative', 'artistic', 'production', 'crisp', 'black-and-white', 'cinematography', 'lighting', 'up', 'eternal', 'mid-May', 'smashing', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'restored', 'prints', 'writing', 'said', 'exceptional', 'characterizations', 'principal', 'cast', 'are', 'perfection', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'warm-up', 'season', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'many', 'will', 'agree', '12-year-old', 'Wally', 'Eddie', 'were', 'mere', 'shadows', 'later', 'selves', 'Season', '2', 'series', 'was', 'full-gear', 'along', 'Seasons', '3', '4', 'represent', 'show', 'peak', 'years', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'Beaver', 'had', 'grown', 'being', 'cute', 'little', 'kid', 'writers', 'were', 'now', 'challenged', 'finding', 'more', 'mature', 'situations', 'Wally', 'many', 'instances', 'succeeded', 'are', 'great', 'episodes', 'season', 'LEAVE', 'IT', 'TO', 'BEAVER', 'should', 'have', 'qualms', 'buying', 'complete', 'set', 'will', 'provide', 'endless', 'laughs', 'pleasure', 'nostalgia']",N/A

1333273,A1CW41HUT7ZOQD,B0038SUBDC,"Phil J. Levine ""enivel7""","[106, 110]","Allow me to begin by paraphrasing Sir Edward of Haskell...""Hey Sam...so you're thinking about whether or not to buy the Complete Leave it To Beaver series box set? Well, Gertrude, let me tell you, don't think twice and just do it!!!""OK. On a more serious note, it's not for nothing that Leave it To Beaver has remained one of the most popular, beloved and copied sitcoms for more than half a century. Sure, it's all too easy to mock or stereotype the show as the quintessential prototype of the Faux Fifties Americana. And, perhaps to some degree,  there is something to that argument. But only to a small degree.However, the REAL reason for the show's enduring success is that it had all the core elements of great television, and most notably, intelligent writing.Let me personalize this to illustrate the point: when I was a kid, back in the late 60s and early 70s I first began watching the show, already in reruns. I enjoyed the show for many reasons, not the least of which was that even then, almost 10 years after it originally aired, it seemed to have timeless childhood themes. Perhaps the lexicon was a tad dated (""Gee, Wally, why are girls so goofy?"") but the fact that the show never mocked the children, but seemed to empathize with them, appealed to me (even if I didn't know why at the time.)Over the years, as the show (obviously) remained the same and I matured (well, mostly) and especially after I became a professional writer, I came to truly appreciate the nuances of the show's writing and the timeless themes of 'growing up' that transcended the arrival of the technological age.Sure, there's an element of nostalgia in the show's popularity, but the fact is that very few shows in the annals of television history have achieved the level of loyalty that LITB ever did--so nostalgia alone cannot be the dominant reason for its enduring success. There was (and still is) a timeless humanity, an ""American"" humanity if you will, reflected in the writing, the acting and casting that became a televised version reflecting what Lincoln referred to as our ""better angels"".Yes, the boys screwed up, and yes Eddie Haskell was a sanctimonious and duplicitous ""creep"", but beneath that shallow exteriors you could always see a frailty and a desire to simply ""fit in"" to a crazy world not of their making.That is something that every kid, everywhere, had/has/will always strive to do.The quality of the DVDs is superb, as close to flawless as you can get for 50s television, and the DVD bonus 'stuff' is great too. Sure, Eddie, Lumpy, Wally and the Beav look like they could be in line at the Walgreen's for their senior's discount medications--whereas just FYI the timeless Barbara Billingsley remains as always a beatific beauty even in her 90s--but that's the shallow way of seeing things. We all age, but it's not whether you age that matters, it's whether you age with dignity.Bob Dylan once asked in song ""have you seen dignity?"" And, aside from being endlessly entertaining, if there is one thing that this box set achieves it's that it reminds us that there was a time when human 'dignity' was not merely a marketing device but a core value worth portraying and striving for.So, bottom line, as a wise (ass) man might have opined, ""lighten up, Sam, and buy the thing.I mean, what are you, a goof or something?""Leave it to Beaver...long may it (re) run.*a sad addendum: we learned today of the passing of the eternally graceful Barbara Billingsley. Words fail to do justice to how beloved a maternal icon ""Mrs Cleaver"" was, is and will always be to those of use who grew up with her as our favorite 'TV mom.' By almost all accounts, she was every bit as genuinely gracious and sweet in real life as she was on the small screen. So on behalf of all of us who spent almost as much time in our formative years with ""june"" as we did our real moms, our heartfelt condolences to Ms. Billingsley's family. She will forever live on in the black  and white television screen as well as our multi-hued dreams. And yes, Eddie was right--that was indeed a most lovely sweater, Mrs. Cleaver.",5,"Gee that's a lovely box set they are selling, Mrs Cleaver",1278460800,"07 7, 2010",2010,4099,"['Allow', 'begin', 'paraphrasing', 'Sir', 'Edward', 'Haskell', 'Hey', 'Sam', 'so', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'not', 'buy', 'Complete', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'series', 'box', 'set', 'Well', 'Gertrude', 'let', 'tell', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'twice', 'just', 'do', 'OK', 'more', 'serious', 'note', 'not', 'nothing', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'remained', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'beloved', 'copied', 'sitcoms', 'more', 'century', 'Sure', 'too', 'easy', 'mock', 'stereotype', 'show', 'quintessential', 'prototype', 'Faux', 'Fifties', 'Americana', 'perhaps', 'degree', 'something', 'argument', 'only', 'small', 'degree.However', 'REAL', 'reason', 'show', 'enduring', 'success', 'had', 'core', 'elements', 'great', 'television', 'most', 'notably', 'intelligent', 'personalize', 'illustrate', 'point', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'back', 'late', '60s', 'early', '70s', 'first', 'began', 'watching', 'show', 'already', 'reruns', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'many', 'reasons', 'not', 'least', 'was', 'even', 'then', 'almost', '10', 'years', 'originally', 'aired', 'seemed', 'have', 'timeless', 'childhood', 'themes', 'Perhaps', 'lexicon', 'was', 'tad', 'dated', 'Gee', 'Wally', 'why', 'are', 'girls', 'so', 'goofy', 'fact', 'show', 'never', 'mocked', 'children', 'seemed', 'empathize', 'appealed', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'time', 'years', 'show', 'obviously', 'remained', 'same', 'matured', 'well', 'mostly', 'especially', 'became', 'professional', 'writer', 'came', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'nuances', 'show', 'writing', 'timeless', 'themes', ""'growing"", 'up', 'transcended', 'arrival', 'technological', 'age.Sure', 'element', 'nostalgia', 'show', 'popularity', 'fact', 'very', 'few', 'shows', 'annals', 'television', 'history', 'have', 'achieved', 'level', 'loyalty', 'LITB', 'ever', 'did', 'so', 'alone', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'dominant', 'reason', 'enduring', 'success', 'was', 'still', 'timeless', 'humanity', 'American', 'humanity', 'will', 'reflected', 'writing', 'acting', 'casting', 'became', 'televised', 'version', 'reflecting', 'what', 'Lincoln', 'referred', 'better', 'angels', '.Yes', 'boys', 'screwed', 'up', 'yes', 'Eddie', 'Haskell', 'was', 'sanctimonious', 'duplicitous', 'creep', 'shallow', 'exteriors', 'could', 'always', 'see', 'frailty', 'desire', 'simply', 'fit', 'crazy', 'world', 'not', 'making.That', 'something', 'kid', 'everywhere', 'had/has/will', 'always', 'strive', 'do.The', 'quality', 'DVDs', 'superb', 'close', 'flawless', 'can', 'get', '50s', 'television', 'DVD', 'bonus', ""'stuff"", 'great', 'too', 'Sure', 'Eddie', 'Lumpy', 'Wally', 'Beav', 'look', 'could', 'be', 'line', 'Walgreen', 'senior', 'discount', 'medications', 'whereas', 'just', 'FYI', 'timeless', 'Barbara', 'Billingsley', 'always', 'beatific', 'beauty', 'even', '90s', 'shallow', 'way', 'seeing', 'things', 'age', 'not', 'age', 'matters', 'age', 'dignity.Bob', 'Dylan', 'once', 'asked', 'song', 'have', 'seen', 'dignity', 'aside', 'being', 'endlessly', 'entertaining', 'one', 'thing', 'box', 'set', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'human', ""'dignity"", 'was', 'not', 'merely', 'marketing', 'device', 'core', 'value', 'portraying', 'striving', 'for.So', 'bottom', 'line', 'wise', 'ass', 'man', 'might', 'have', 'opined', 'lighten', 'up', 'Sam', 'buy', 'thing.I', 'mean', 'what', 'are', 'goof', 'something', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'long', 'may', 're', 'run', 'sad', 'addendum', 'learned', 'today', 'passing', 'eternally', 'graceful', 'Barbara', 'Billingsley', 'Words', 'fail', 'do', 'justice', 'how', 'beloved', 'maternal', 'icon', 'Mrs', 'Cleaver', 'was', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'use', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'favorite', 'mom', 'almost', 'accounts', 'was', 'bit', 'genuinely', 'gracious', 'sweet', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'small', 'screen', 'So', 'behalf', 'who', 'spent', 'almost', 'much', 'time', 'formative', 'years', 'june', 'did', 'real', 'moms', 'heartfelt', 'condolences', 'Ms.', 'Billingsley', 'family', 'will', 'forever', 'live', 'black', 'white', 'television', 'screen', 'as', 'well', 'multi-hued', 'dreams', 'yes', 'Eddie', 'was', 'right', 'was', 'indeed', 'most', 'lovely', 'sweater', 'Mrs.', 'Cleaver']",N/A

Dixon,"[3, 3]","Some comparisons with the studio releases (based on my out-of-the-box impression):  I also own the first two seasons that were issued directly from the studios.  I literally just opened this set after it arrived so I can't be more detailed right now.First, the layout and manufacture quality:  Shout Factory hit this one right out of the park!  Instead of cramming an entire season on 3 two sided discs (like the studio release), Shout Factory issued each season on six one sided discs.  Thank you!Second: Picture quality.  There are limits to what you can do with these old shows.  Having said that, the graininess noted by some on the original studio releases  of seasons one and two, is not completely gone, but looks much improved.  Picture quality is excellent.  Based on a quick look at an episode from season two, it looks like Shout Factory did a much better job restoring the episodes.I have other TV series from Shout Factory, including Combat.  This meets or exceeds their usual high standards seen in previous TV series reissues.  AND it certainly exceeds the studio releases in EVERY way!Keep in mind that I haven't  even finished watching a single episode.

Simple stories told with great emotion and humor...much different than the current fair of completely over stimulated shows kids are subjected to today.1)  packaging...1st class all the wayeach season is housed  in its own multi disc case WITH a helpful booklet with episode information. They are all  housed in a sturdy and attractive box...this is just 1st class and something SHOUT Factory is building a reputation for...I know many who are  excited to see them take over series  like  Garry Shandling,  Larry Sanders  and Dragnet to  name a few because the quality goes way up!!2) tech stuff...the DVDs are all dual layer single sided , which is a huge improvement over the Universal  ""flipper"" discs originally issued for seasons 1 and 2the image on the discs are  first rate and a big improvement over the previous editions. Another reviewer said they are ""darker"" but the Universal sets were what we call ""washed out"" in photo terms..meaning the highlights were far too light so these DVDs are far richer and with much greater depth...just stunning.  Nice menus..great music of courseOH and to the nut job who thinks its a waste because you can record them  off TV...the episodes are over 25 minutes  so  cutting is  going into the versions being aired and besides...they just look  better on this set than they do on TV...like the ultimate Lucy episodes..3) Bonus features..a  whole bonus DVD (for  me I like putting the bonus features on a bonus Disc instead of  dividing them  up among other discs) and while the features are amateurishly shot , edited and assembled but they do have a ton of  interesting interviews with the living participants/actors and I found them to be fun and informative.  there are audio bonus features on the individual sets but I haven't checked  them out as of yet..as a ""Baby Boomer"" myself I  grew up with the Nelsons  and Leave  it to  Beaver so this has been a trip down memory lane (I haven't  seen these  since they originally aired) in the best sense. Its  sad  that so  many prime time network shows  now feature bleeping of dialog .. this makes me happy to remember my youth but sad that things have gone  so  far  afield  since.Bottom line,  if  you are a fan..you will be rewarded by purchasing...(for gosh sakes 235  episodes plus a bonus disc...WOW  that is a lot of wonderful programming  over 37 DVDs and less than a buck a show even at FULL LIST price).if your not...maybe try season three which is  now available as a stand alone, but  really if  you aren't already a fan I doubt you'd be reasding this....and to paraphrase Eddie  Haskell...

Each of the 6 seasons have 39 episodes that are spread out over 6 single-sided dual-layered dvds which are housed in their own separate cases. All 6 dvd cases plus a bonus dvd are housed inside a vary sturdy cardboard slipcase.Video: Shout Factory went all-out and did an incredible job remastering Leave It To Beaver. The show is presented in its original full frame 1:33 ratio and looks fantastic. The show is in black & white and looks clean, sharp, and bright.Audio: The only audio track on this set is English 2.0 mono. It is clear sounding and I have no complaintsSubtitles: There are no subtitles on the set but it is close-captioned in English only. I'm not sure why Shout didn't include subtitles in this day and age where hdmi is so frequently used. Hdmi does not support close-captioning. If you connect your dvd player to your tv via hdmi, you cannot access the close-captioning and will need to connect your player tv via composite cables and watch the show with slightly degraded picture quality. This is not an issue to me but I figured it may be a big issue for others and is worth mentioning.Extras: Each season includes an episode of Shokus Internet Radio's Stu's Show. This is an audio only feature that plays over several episodes. The shows are fun to listen to and include various interviews Jerry Mathers, Tony Dow, Ken Osmond, and Frank Bank.There is also a bonus dvd exclusive to this set that has a bunch of goodies on it. It includes: 1. The LITB unaired pilot, 'It's a Small World'. 2. Barbara Billingsley, Jerry Mathers, and Tony Dow take a trip down memory lane and talk about the show in the 74 minute 'Forever the Beaver, The Cleavers Look Back'.  3. The 30 minute 'Ken Osmond and Frank Bank Remember'. 4. 'The Drum Major of the Toy Parade' is a short interview with composer Dave Kahn.  5.

1333289,A1QIL7847ET6HX,B0038SUBDC,xxgrendelxx,"[9, 11]","There is, in the popular mindset, a tendency when speaking or writing of utterly wholesome, saccahrine and familial subjects to compare them to ""Leave it to Beaver"". Perfect mom, perfect dad, perfect little white kids in their perfect little home.Yet, thanks to the extraordinary writing talents and amusing personal recollections of series writers Bob Mosher and Joe Connelly LITB was never actually like that. The series is, in fact, a remarkably honest slice of small town American life populated with real people, people with character flaws and personal demons that find their way in the most uncontrived manner into the plots.Each episode is more than just ""the Beave gets in trouble"". It is also continually subversive, not quite in a MAD magazine fashion but more subtley. Watching the first two seasons I couldn't help but feel that many of my own experiences were mirrored despite the temporal difference of twenty years (I grew up in the 1970s). 'Boys will be boys' may have been a more accurate name for the series. The plots are practically iconic reperesentations of events and situations that all boys face at one piont or other, and LITB does not sugar coat the consequences or adhere to any happier an ending than that the family still loves one another.In this manner, the series is more than just entertainment. ""Beaver""'s trials are minor morality plays yet they are without mawkish sentiment to Connelly and Mosher's credit. When the boys come to ""Ward"", their father, for clarity or advice he does not always have easy answers, and he advises them to use their good sense and kind hearts to navigate the path through childhood. Considering the absolutist morality in situation comedies just twenty years later such as M*A*S*H, this is a true achievement wholly creditable to Connelly and Mosher.Another aspect of the show visible only now, and long after its initial telecast, is in considering the historical period the boys were poised to enter, the 1960s. When the ""Beav"" sneaks a smoke it is difficult not to laugh and consider that in just a few years that toke will likely be marijuana and if ""June"" thinks she has a tough time rasing the boys now, just wait until they hear their first Rolling Stones song or witness President Kennedy shot. How will the family respond during the Cuban missile crisis?And what of ""Wally"" and his friend ""Eddie Haskell""? Playing soldier on LITB makes for an amusing plot, but will they go to Vietnam? Will ""June"" and ""Ward"" support the war or the protesters? The characters in LITB are written just real enough to make all these musings take on a certain gravity and develop a pathos for them and what they'll have to endure - a mirror for what our country endured. In our own lives the comments of children frequently come back to haunt us as they grow older and test life's limits and, with hindsight, so does LITB.I was never interested in the ""Cosby Show"", ""Family Ties"" or any of the others of the plethora of family based sit-coms in the 1980s - my own family was not remotely wealthy and barely middle class and I couldn't relate. But LITB I did relate to and still do, and I heartily recommend the series to young dads wishing to share a laugh or two with their tykes, and maybe absorb some of the hard won wisdom Connelly and Mosher shared with us initially back when and continue to share with us.*** As a minor but amusing observation, in the episode ""Wally's Haircomb"" where Wally gets in trouble for wearing his hair ""fashionably"" Beaver comes down the stairs at the end with his own hair done quite Punk-esque (see You Tube for the episode: part three of three, at 2:39).Actress Judy Croll in the Sex Pistols film ""The Great Rock and Roll Swindle"" who plays Malcolm McLaren's assistant as ""The Catwoman"" (portraying punk scene personality Soo Catwoman) has her hair done exactly the same (See Soo Catowman at Wikipedia).I wonder if Soo, who apparently designed her hair herself, saw that episode in England?
