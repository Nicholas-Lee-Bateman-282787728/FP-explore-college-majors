590282,A2PYMYL11MW8N5,B00005JKPT,Aaron Wooldridge,"[0, 2]","This is not actually a review of the Criterion version. The Criterion version of Contempt is out of print with used copies selling for more than 50 dollars. That is more than I can afford to spend on a single DVD. I really wanted to watch this movie, but I don't have a Blu-Ray player, my wi-fi connection is not good enough for streaming, and I could not find an affordable American DVD of this movie. I finally resorted to buying a really cheap, region-free Korean DVD of this movie. The Korean version has no special features. The video coloring is not consistent, and the subtitle translations are sometimes awkward. But I finally got to see this movie without spending insane dollars on a used Criterion copy. My version is also in the original Cinnescope, not pan & scan.Contempt is the fourth Jean-Luc Godard film I have seen afterAlphaville (The Criterion Collection),Band of Outsiders (The Criterion Collection), andMasculin Feminin (The Criterion Collection). Out of these four movies Contempt is by far Godard's most accessible and easiest to follow film. It has an actual linear plot, very little narrator or text interruptions, and fewer esoteric techniques than the other films. By comparison Alphaville has a plot but it is obscured by lots of philosophical monologuing, Band of Outsiders has a small plot which is incidental to the greater importance of lots of little moments, and Masculin Feminin has very little plot at all. In contrast to these Contempt has a much more straightforward and traditional plot.Ostensibly Contempt is a film about making a film, but at its core it is really the story of a declining marriage. The film being made is a version of the Odyssey, and Contempt's protagonist develops a new theory about the Odyssey inspired by his own marital problems. What if Odysseus went to fight at Troy because things weren't going so well with him and Penelope at home, and what if it took him 10 years to return because he was in no hurry to get back to a wife who didn't love him anymore? It is a question worth asking and a very striking mental image in this film.Contempt is the first color Godard film I have seen and has absolutely brilliant cinematography with beautiful images. Star Bridgette Bardot is gorgeous and appears semi-nude in several scenes. Excellent supporting roles include American actor Jack Palance (known for playing cowboy tough guys in movies like City Slickers) and legendary German director Fritz Lang (Metropolis, M) playing himself.Contempt is an amazing and emotionally moving motion picture. When an affordable US DVD version is released I will be sure to buy it. Until then I highly recommend that you see this movie, even if you have to get a foreign or bootlegged copy.",5,Criterion version out of print.,1314057600,"08 23, 2011",2011,2739,"['not', 'actually', 'review', 'Criterion', 'version', 'Criterion', 'version', 'Contempt', 'print', 'used', 'copies', 'selling', 'more', '50', 'dollars', 'more', 'can', 'afford', 'spend', 'single', 'DVD', 'really', 'wanted', 'watch', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Blu-Ray', 'player', 'wi-fi', 'connection', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'streaming', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'affordable', 'American', 'DVD', 'movie', 'finally', 'resorted', 'buying', 'really', 'cheap', 'region-free', 'Korean', 'DVD', 'movie', 'Korean', 'version', 'special', 'features', 'video', 'coloring', 'not', 'consistent', 'subtitle', 'translations', 'are', 'sometimes', 'awkward', 'finally', 'got', 'see', 'movie', 'spending', 'insane', 'dollars', 'used', 'Criterion', 'copy', 'version', 'also', 'original', 'Cinnescope', 'not', 'pan', 'scan.Contempt', 'fourth', 'Jean-Luc', 'Godard', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'afterAlphaville', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'Band', 'Outsiders', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'andMasculin', 'Feminin', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'four', 'movies', 'Contempt', 'far', 'Godard', 'most', 'accessible', 'easiest', 'follow', 'film', 'actual', 'linear', 'plot', 'very', 'little', 'narrator', 'text', 'interruptions', 'fewer', 'esoteric', 'techniques', 'other', 'films', 'comparison', 'Alphaville', 'plot', 'obscured', 'lots', 'philosophical', 'monologuing', 'Band', 'Outsiders', 'small', 'plot', 'incidental', 'greater', 'importance', 'lots', 'little', 'moments', 'Masculin', 'Feminin', 'very', 'little', 'plot', 'contrast', 'Contempt', 'much', 'more', 'straightforward', 'traditional', 'plot.Ostensibly', 'Contempt', 'film', 'making', 'film', 'core', 'really', 'story', 'declining', 'marriage', 'film', 'being', 'made', 'version', 'Odyssey', 'Contempt', 'protagonist', 'new', 'theory', 'Odyssey', 'inspired', 'own', 'marital', 'problems', 'What', 'Odysseus', 'went', 'fight', 'Troy', 'things', 'were', ""n't"", 'going', 'so', 'well', 'Penelope', 'home', 'what', 'took', '10', 'years', 'return', 'was', 'hurry', 'get', 'back', 'wife', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'anymore', 'question', 'asking', 'very', 'striking', 'mental', 'image', 'film.Contempt', 'first', 'color', 'Godard', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'images', 'Star', 'Bridgette', 'Bardot', 'gorgeous', 'semi-nude', 'several', 'scenes', 'Excellent', 'supporting', 'roles', 'include', 'American', 'actor', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'known', 'playing', 'cowboy', 'tough', 'guys', 'movies', 'City', 'Slickers', 'legendary', 'German', 'director', 'Fritz', 'Lang', 'Metropolis', 'M', 'playing', 'himself.Contempt', 'amazing', 'emotionally', 'moving', 'motion', 'picture', 'When', 'affordable', 'US', 'DVD', 'version', 'released', 'will', 'be', 'sure', 'buy', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend', 'see', 'movie', 'even', 'have', 'get', 'foreign', 'bootlegged', 'copy']",Contempt
590283,A3JXOXKWOIETIY,B00005JKPT,"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse""","[9, 16]","I prefer this film to Fellini's 8 1/2 and there are some similarities.  They were made at the same time and they were the first two post-modern films.  In this one B.B. is given some good nude scenes we male fans crave in the context of a top notch 1963 work of art.  Fritz Lang plays himself and when he mentions B.B. he's talking about Bertolt Brecht, not Brigitte Bardot who doesn't play herself (one of many in jokes).  What I love here is the 1960s feel of the film, the melancholy soundtrack which is supposed to express B.B.s emotions, and masterful cinematography.  The scenes are set up perfectly and in one we see B.B. in one room talking to Michel Piccoli in another...in the same shot.There is a modern feel to the film made in color set in Capri, and a feeling of freedom.  The plot is that B.B. feels &quot;contempt&quot; for her husband because he lets Jack Palance come on to her, and it works with brilliant subtlety.  The ending is kind of another in joke, as there's a bit of dialogue by Lang &quot;death is not a resolution&quot;.  In one scene the stars are all interacting against a background of current movie posters (&quot;Psycho&quot; among them).  And Palance needs a translator from English to French, German, and Italian in the way of the beautiful Giorgia Moll.

However, it stayed with me, and I've had another try. I still fast-forwarded some of the scenes, but lingered longer on some of the others. It seems to me that Godard oozes contempt for everything and everyone involved with this picture, including the picture itself, except, possibly, Fritz Lang. Lang is too old and too wise to be an object of Godard's scorn. Godard appears to me to despise Hollywood, Hollywood producers, Hollywood films, his own producer, nude starlets, the film industry, Cinemascope, remakes of classic texts, mercenary writers, melodramatic cop-out endings, movie audiences, weak husbands and, especially, the type of wife who wants to have her cake and eat it. He also seems to feel contempt for himself --- but perhaps I'm reading too much into it all: the whole thing is perverse. I think his feeling towards the actors may be neutral, for want of a better word. At least, they seem to be giving him what he wants. Bardot gives a fine performance, imho, and so do the others: always supposing Palance is meant to be as wooden as he appears. The analysis of womanly logic in the apartment dialogue is deeply misogynistic, but also extremely accurate. I will give this film a third go, and watch it patiently all the way through, as I suspect it will reveal more as time goes by. But it is a sour piece of work, and I doubt whether I would upgrade it to 5 stars, although I've given 5 to worse films. It is thought-provoking, but the thoughts it provokes are not welcome.

590288,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,B00005JKPT,Christopher Culver,"[0, 0]","Jean-Luc Godard's 1963 film LE M&Eacute;PRIS (Contempt) is the remarkably international story of a French marriage falling apart during an Italian film shoot directed by a German filmmaker and funded by an American producer. Fritz Lang, playing himself, has been making a innovative treatment of Homer's Odyssey, but the boorish Jeremy Prokosch (Jack Palance) wants a blockbuster, not an art film. Prokosch hires the screenwriter Paul Javal (Michel Piccoli) for a rewrite, hoping to temper Lang's abstraction. Javal has come to Italy with his wife Camille (Brigitte Bardot), and the collapse of their relationship is the central drama of the film. It is in fact Camille's barely-surpressed hatred for her husband that ostensibly gives the film its title.The project started as a straightforward adaptation of an Alberto Moravia novel. However, once American financing came in, Godard decided to turn the funding back on its source, striking a blow against the Hollywood system by depicting the American producer as a despicable lech, and Fritz Lang as a genius who has long suffered insults. The film's backers wanted Bardot in nude scenes, but Godard fulfills this obligation in a way that is like thumbing his nose at them. The comments by my fellow reviewer Turfseer, left on May 22, 2011, are enlightening in this regard. However, as bitter and somewhat juvenile as Godard's critique of Hollywood may be, I feel that Le M&Eacute;PRIS is saved, indeed occasionally raised to sublime heights, by several elements.One is the use of colour in this film. Outdoor shots are bleached into colourlessness by the Mediterranean sun, but indoor shots repeatedly feature stunning shades of red and blue. It is almost as if the film itself is alive. I had never seen anything quite like it. Then there's Georges Delerue's film score, which consists mainly of a lush motif on strings that, when Godard choses to overlay the score, repeats endlessly. In spite of its brevity, this motif is more than enough to maintain interest and tug viewers' heartstrings, and one can even see it as a forebear of Minimalism.Then, Godard had employed Brecht's principle of alienation -- reminding the audience that they are watching a theatrical performance and not real life -- before LE M&Eacute;PRIS, but he goes whole hog with the technique to great effect. For example, near the end of the film we are shown the aftermath of a car crash, where the passengers are impossibly slumped facing in opposite directions and everything is very stylized, I find one of the most memorable shots in cinema.The Criterion Collection 2-disc release of LE M&Eacute;PRIS has the film on one DVD and extras on the other. The film comes with a great audio commentary track by film scholar Robert Stam. The second disc's extras were mainly shot in the 1960s. There is a conversation between Lang and Godard from 1967, a portrait of Lang shot on the Capri set of LE M&Eacute;PRIS, another short portrait filmed on-set of Godard and Bardot, and a television interview with Godard from just after the film was completed. Finally, cinematographer Raoul Coutard is interviewed around the turn of the millennium.",4,"Even if Godard's blow struck against Hollywood is childish in some ways, this film has some remarkable qualities",1382918400,"10 28, 2013",2013,3166,"['Jean-Luc', 'Godard', '1963', 'film', 'LE', 'M', 'Eacute', 'PRIS', 'Contempt', 'remarkably', 'international', 'story', 'French', 'marriage', 'falling', 'apart', 'Italian', 'film', 'shoot', 'directed', 'German', 'filmmaker', 'funded', 'American', 'producer', 'Fritz', 'Lang', 'playing', 'been', 'making', 'innovative', 'treatment', 'Homer', 'Odyssey', 'boorish', 'Jeremy', 'Prokosch', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'blockbuster', 'not', 'art', 'film', 'Prokosch', 'screenwriter', 'Paul', 'Javal', 'Michel', 'Piccoli', 'rewrite', 'hoping', 'temper', 'Lang', 'abstraction', 'Javal', 'come', 'Italy', 'wife', 'Camille', 'Brigitte', 'Bardot', 'collapse', 'relationship', 'central', 'drama', 'film', 'fact', 'Camille', 'barely-surpressed', 'hatred', 'husband', 'ostensibly', 'film', 'title.The', 'project', 'started', 'straightforward', 'adaptation', 'Alberto', 'Moravia', 'novel', 'However', 'once', 'American', 'financing', 'came', 'Godard', 'decided', 'turn', 'funding', 'back', 'source', 'striking', 'blow', 'Hollywood', 'system', 'depicting', 'American', 'producer', 'despicable', 'lech', 'Fritz', 'Lang', 'genius', 'who', 'long', 'suffered', 'insults', 'film', 'backers', 'wanted', 'Bardot', 'nude', 'scenes', 'Godard', 'obligation', 'way', 'thumbing', 'nose', 'comments', 'fellow', 'reviewer', 'Turfseer', 'left', 'May', '22', '2011', 'are', 'enlightening', 'regard', 'However', 'bitter', 'somewhat', 'juvenile', 'Godard', 'critique', 'Hollywood', 'may', 'be', 'feel', 'Le', 'M', 'Eacute', 'PRIS', 'saved', 'indeed', 'occasionally', 'raised', 'sublime', 'heights', 'several', 'elements.One', 'use', 'colour', 'film', 'Outdoor', 'shots', 'are', 'bleached', 'colourlessness', 'Mediterranean', 'sun', 'indoor', 'shots', 'repeatedly', 'feature', 'stunning', 'shades', 'red', 'blue', 'almost', 'film', 'alive', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'quite', 'Then', 'Georges', 'Delerue', 'film', 'score', 'mainly', 'lush', 'motif', 'strings', 'when', 'Godard', 'overlay', 'score', 'endlessly', 'spite', 'brevity', 'motif', 'more', 'enough', 'maintain', 'interest', 'tug', 'viewers', 'heartstrings', 'one', 'can', 'even', 'see', 'forebear', 'Minimalism.Then', 'Godard', 'had', 'employed', 'Brecht', 'principle', 'alienation', 'reminding', 'audience', 'are', 'watching', 'theatrical', 'performance', 'not', 'real', 'life', 'LE', 'M', 'Eacute', 'PRIS', 'whole', 'hog', 'technique', 'great', 'effect', 'example', 'end', 'film', 'are', 'shown', 'aftermath', 'car', 'crash', 'where', 'passengers', 'are', 'impossibly', 'slumped', 'facing', 'opposite', 'directions', 'everything', 'very', 'stylized', 'find', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'shots', 'cinema.The', 'Criterion', 'Collection', '2-disc', 'release', 'LE', 'M', 'Eacute', 'PRIS', 'film', 'one', 'DVD', 'extras', 'other', 'film', 'great', 'audio', 'commentary', 'track', 'film', 'scholar', 'Robert', 'Stam', 'second', 'disc', 'extras', 'were', 'mainly', 'shot', '1960s', 'conversation', 'Lang', 'Godard', '1967', 'portrait', 'Lang', 'shot', 'Capri', 'set', 'LE', 'M', 'Eacute', 'PRIS', 'short', 'portrait', 'filmed', 'on-set', 'Godard', 'Bardot', 'television', 'interview', 'Godard', 'just', 'film', 'was', 'completed', 'Finally', 'cinematographer', 'Raoul', 'Coutard', 'interviewed', 'turn', 'millennium']",Contempt
590289,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B00005JKPT,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[11, 14]","Of the films I've seen so far of French New Wave director Jean-Luc Godard, his best is 1963's Contempt (Les M&eacute;pris), adapted by Godard from Alberto Moravia's novel Il Disprezzo, published in English as The Ghost At Noon. That statement should not be taken as an acknowledgment of greatness, for although this is his best film, it is not close to being a great film for, despite a gorgeous aping of the Michelangelo Antonioni style of shooting widescreen landscapes and affinity for formal structures, the film lacks any of the metaphysical heft and narrative thrust that propel the best of Antonioni's work, such as La Notte or Blowup. If Antonioni were more pretentious and less a wellspring of ideas, he would have made Contempt. That said, it's not a bad film, and it does exert an odd power over the viewer, above and beyond the nude ogling of a sexy, young, and ineffably feline Brigitte Bardot.... While clearly influenced by Antonioni's L'Avventura- although shot in color, especially in the scenes at Capri, at the famous Malaparte Villa, replete with wedge shaped brick and stone stairs and crags that rise from the sea, cinematographer Raoul Coutard displays that he actually had talent, unlike some of the earlier, visually sloppier films of Godard. The red, yellow, white, and blue palette Technicolor scheme also is effectively evoked to give the film a look that is more modern than many contemporary films, as well as being more modern and mature in the screenplay and attitudes- despite its flaws. Coutard also makes great use of the Cinemascope wide shots- called Francescope in this production, as characters are constantly and interestingly framed at the edged of the screen. Another plus is the use of flashbacks and flashforwards as voiceovers rove, for this effectively demonstrates the faronzaled attitudes of the characters. A big negative, however, is the Georges Delerue score. The main theme herks and jerks into inappropriate scenes, and often adds a melodramatic touch that is almost laughable. It also rises up and cuts off without warning, or any relation to the onscreen goings on, and each instance of its use progressively weakens its impact. In the commentary, Stam claims that the music is used as punctuation on dramatic and/or important moments, but this is simply not so. It is undisciplined and poorly applied. To say the least, Godard was no Werner Herzog with soundtracks.This sort of artistic anomy- along with that in other aspects of the film, may make many vapid critics masturbate, but great art is not the child that such bears. Too much is left open ended in the film, and that which is resolved simply is not that fascinating, since the viewer is never given enough to care about the characters. In this sense, Godard shares as much `contempt' for his viewers as many of the bad Hollywood films, and the material machinations that produce them, this film seems to criticize. Still, it is his most successful film at connecting with an audience, more so than that other reflexive 1963 opus on filmmaking, Federico Fellini's 8; although Contempt is not as good a film. Nor is it as nearly as cogent a comment on marriage as either Antonioni's La Notte nor Ingmar Bergman's Scenes From A Marriage. The thirty minute interlude, especially, pales in comparison to Bergman's crackling and realistic, if intelligentsia-laden, repartee.One wonders what might have occurred had Godard done more big budget films, for the rigor of having to meet some others' expectations disciplined him, and toned down his most masturbatory tendencies. Unfortunately, he never again went so mainstream, a thing which is often a pox on an artist- think about all the Hollywood films of the last thirty years, or that Chick Lit that you are reading, but which occasionally can help a `fringe' artist, with delusions of grandeur and an empty philosophy, mediate into excellence. Without it, Godard is simply Godard, and Contempt a beautiful film that is lifeless and flaccid, where nothing happens. It is populated by mannekins which have no lives of their own. This makes for a pretty window display, but gets old quickly after you've taken it all in.",3,Godard's best?,1221004800,"09 10, 2008",2008,4181,"['films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'French', 'New', 'Wave', 'director', 'Jean-Luc', 'Godard', 'best', '1963', 'Contempt', 'Les', 'M', 'eacute', 'pris', 'adapted', 'Godard', 'Alberto', 'Moravia', 'novel', 'Il', 'Disprezzo', 'published', 'English', 'Ghost', 'Noon', 'statement', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'acknowledgment', 'greatness', 'best', 'film', 'not', 'close', 'being', 'great', 'film', 'gorgeous', 'aping', 'Michelangelo', 'Antonioni', 'style', 'shooting', 'widescreen', 'landscapes', 'affinity', 'formal', 'structures', 'film', 'metaphysical', 'heft', 'narrative', 'thrust', 'best', 'Antonioni', 'work', 'such', 'La', 'Notte', 'Blowup', 'Antonioni', 'were', 'more', 'pretentious', 'less', 'wellspring', 'ideas', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'Contempt', 'said', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'exert', 'odd', 'power', 'viewer', 'nude', 'ogling', 'sexy', 'young', 'ineffably', 'feline', 'Brigitte', 'Bardot', 'clearly', 'influenced', 'Antonioni', ""L'Avventura-"", 'shot', 'color', 'especially', 'scenes', 'Capri', 'famous', 'Malaparte', 'Villa', 'replete', 'wedge', 'shaped', 'brick', 'stone', 'stairs', 'crags', 'rise', 'sea', 'cinematographer', 'Raoul', 'Coutard', 'actually', 'had', 'talent', 'earlier', 'visually', 'sloppier', 'films', 'Godard', 'red', 'yellow', 'white', 'blue', 'palette', 'Technicolor', 'scheme', 'also', 'effectively', 'evoked', 'give', 'film', 'look', 'more', 'modern', 'many', 'contemporary', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'more', 'modern', 'mature', 'screenplay', 'attitudes-', 'flaws', 'Coutard', 'also', 'great', 'use', 'Cinemascope', 'wide', 'shots-', 'called', 'Francescope', 'production', 'characters', 'are', 'constantly', 'interestingly', 'framed', 'edged', 'screen', 'use', 'flashbacks', 'flashforwards', 'voiceovers', 'rove', 'effectively', 'faronzaled', 'attitudes', 'characters', 'big', 'negative', 'however', 'Georges', 'Delerue', 'score', 'main', 'theme', 'herks', 'jerks', 'inappropriate', 'scenes', 'often', 'melodramatic', 'touch', 'almost', 'laughable', 'also', 'up', 'cuts', 'off', 'warning', 'relation', 'onscreen', 'goings', 'instance', 'use', 'progressively', 'impact', 'commentary', 'Stam', 'music', 'used', 'punctuation', 'dramatic', 'and/or', 'important', 'moments', 'simply', 'not', 'so', 'undisciplined', 'poorly', 'applied', 'say', 'least', 'Godard', 'was', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'soundtracks.This', 'sort', 'artistic', 'anomy-', 'other', 'aspects', 'film', 'may', 'make', 'many', 'vapid', 'critics', 'masturbate', 'great', 'art', 'not', 'child', 'such', 'bears', 'Too', 'much', 'left', 'open', 'ended', 'film', 'resolved', 'simply', 'not', 'fascinating', 'viewer', 'never', 'given', 'enough', 'care', 'characters', 'sense', 'Godard', 'shares', 'much', 'contempt', 'viewers', 'many', 'bad', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'material', 'machinations', 'produce', 'film', 'criticize', 'Still', 'most', 'successful', 'film', 'connecting', 'audience', 'more', 'so', 'other', 'reflexive', '1963', 'opus', 'filmmaking', 'Federico', 'Fellini', '8', 'Contempt', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'film', 'as', 'nearly', 'cogent', 'comment', 'marriage', 'Antonioni', 'La', 'Notte', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'Scenes', 'Marriage', 'thirty', 'minute', 'interlude', 'especially', 'pales', 'comparison', 'Bergman', 'crackling', 'realistic', 'intelligentsia-laden', 'repartee.One', 'wonders', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'occurred', 'had', 'Godard', 'done', 'more', 'big', 'budget', 'films', 'rigor', 'having', 'meet', 'others', 'expectations', 'disciplined', 'toned', 'down', 'most', 'masturbatory', 'tendencies', 'Unfortunately', 'never', 'again', 'went', 'so', 'mainstream', 'thing', 'often', 'pox', 'artist-', 'think', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'last', 'thirty', 'years', 'Chick', 'Lit', 'are', 'reading', 'occasionally', 'can', 'help', 'fringe', 'artist', 'delusions', 'grandeur', 'empty', 'philosophy', 'mediate', 'excellence', 'Godard', 'simply', 'Godard', 'Contempt', 'beautiful', 'film', 'lifeless', 'flaccid', 'where', 'nothing', 'populated', 'mannekins', 'have', 'lives', 'own', 'pretty', 'window', 'display', 'old', 'quickly', ""'ve"", 'taken']",Contempt

590291,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00005JKPT,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[5, 6]","With Jean-Luc Godard spearheading the French New Wave after many of his other contemporaries have been forgotten, Italian film producer Carlo Ponti and Jean-Luc Godard began work on  the film ""Le Mepris"" (Contempt) in 1963.  A film that would be an adaptation of Alberto Moravia's novel ""The Ghost at Noon"" and also would be Godard's first foray to what can be seen as a commercial film with celebrities, but done the Jean-Luc Godard way.Known as probably one of Godard's more accessible films, despite known for working with his wife Anna Karina for many of his films prior to ""Le Mepris"", as the film was being looked at as a film to attract international attention, the most photographed woman in the world at the time, Brigitte Bardot, is featured in the film.  Alongside actors Michel Piccoli (""Dillinger is Dead""), Jack Palance and Giorga Moll.  Also, the film would mark a collaboration with Jean-Luc Godard and one of his favorite director's Fritz Lang (""Metropolis"", ""M"", ""Die Nibelungen"") who will be playing the character of a director with the same name and also would reunite Godard with French New Wave's Jacques Rozier (who would direct two documentaries that relate to the film ""Contempt"").The film revolves around playwright Paul Javal (played by Michel Piccoli) and his wife Camille (played by Brigitte Bardot).  The two are very much in love and spend time with each other but when Paul is called to meet with producer Jeremy Prokosch (played by Jack Palance) and his interpreter/assistant Francesca Vanini (played by Giorgia Moll), his life is changed when the arrogant producer is not thrilled with the screenplay of the movie that Fritz Lang has shot.Paul is paid $10,000 to write a new screenplay for the commercial version of ""Ulysses and his Odyssey"" which will be directed by Fritz Lang.  For Paul, this sounds like an excellent chance for him to pay off the apartment where he and Camille live.  So, when Camille goes to meet with Paul, Prokosch looks as if he is more interested in getting to know Paul's wife.  In fact, he allows her to ride with him (in his two-seater Alfa Romero) to his place while he goes to fetch a taxi.By the time he arrives, Paul notices his wife is upset and distant and he can't understand why she is upset.  While his wife is sulking, Paul flirts around with the translator Francesca and gives her a tap on the bottom which Camille catches him doing.  For Paul, this is no big deal.But when they arrive home, Camille tells him that she no longer loves him in fact that she now has feels contempt towards him. He asks why?  Yesterday, she loved him and now she doesn't.  She looks at the experience of that day of her husband using her to achieve his business deal, he looks at the situation as a way to pay of their debt.  But she sees Prokosch's motivation, Paul does not.  And right before our eyes, we see the disintegration of a marriage.""Contempt"" is a film that would spotlight the conflict of a director and the producer but also the incompatibility and misunderstandings of a reflective man and an instinctive woman.VIDEO:""Contempt"" is presented in 2:35:1 and filmed via cinemascope in full color.  The film would become one of the first films that Godard and cinematographer Raoul Coutard would utilize color in a manner that they have never done before.  And shooting in the beautiful locations of Capri and in Rome, ""Contempt"" is a gorgeous film (which of course would look even better on Blu-ray, side note: the Blu-ray has been released in America by StudioCanal) with colors looking much more vibrant.It's also important to note that so many people who have seen this film on television, saw it in 4:3 standard format with the sides cut off and thus giving the worst presentation of the film as it was not meant to be.  With this DVD release, viewers saw this film in its original theatrical aspect.According to the Criterion Collection, the new high-definition digital transfer was created from a 35mm interpositive made from the restored camera negative and was supervised by Beatrice Valbin of StudioCanal and cinematographer Raoul Coutard. To further enhance the image, the MTI Digital Restoration System was used to remove thousands of instances of dirt, debris and scratches.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Contempt"" is presented in monaural French with optional English subtitles.  According to the Criterion Collection, the soundtrack was mastered from a 35mm magnetic track and mastered at 24-bit.  Audio restoration tools were used to reduce clicks, pops, hiss and crackle.For the most part, the dialogue and music is clear.  I opted to listen to the film with my receiver set to stereo on all channels.  And I absolutely loved the music by Georges Delerue which fit the mood for the film.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Contempt - THE CRITERION COLLECTION #171"" comes with the following special features:DISC 1:* Audio Commentary by Film Scholar Robert Stam - An informative commentary by film scholar Robert Stam who does a fantastic job in dissecting various scenes of the movie.DISC 2:* The Dinosaur and the Baby (1967): a conversation between Jean-Luc Godard and Fritz Lang - (1:00:12) A conversation between Godard and Fritz Lang released back in 1967 as part of the ""Cineastes Du Notre Temps"" series produced by Andre Labarthe.  The two would discuss what it is like being a director, on being romantic, youth, censorship, if Fritz Lang would ever direct again, difference in method, mise-en-sene, why make a film today and more.  A wonderful special feature to see both directors discussing cinema.* Le Parti Des Choses: Bardot et Godard - (9:32) A short documentary by Jacques Rozier.  The documentary would show Godard and Bardot working together.* Paparazzi - (17:49) A documentary by Jacques Rozier about the difficult of filming ""Contempt"" as paparazzi would do whatever it took to capture a photo of Brigitte Bardot.  We get to see how Bardot feels about them and also the perspective from the paparazzi's eyes.* Jean-Luc Godard interview excerpt - (10:30) An interview with Godard who addresses his feelings about film reviews and audience response to his previous films.* A new video interview with legendary cinematographer Raoul Coutard - (26:28) Coutard talks about working with Godard, shooting the film in Cinemascope and also some behind-the-scenes discussion about the filming of ""Contempt"" and the talent.* Widescreen vs. Fullframe - (4:02) A short featurette showing how ""Contempt"" was cut when going from 2:35:1 to 4:3 during the TV screening of the film. Showing what parts were cut off from the 2:35:1 version when shown on television and how it changes the film quite significantly.* Original theatrical trailer - (2:29) The original theatrical trailer for ""Le Mepris"".* Contempt: A Story of a Marriage - Included is a five-fold insert featuring an essay by Phillip LopateJUDGMENT CALL:""Contempt"" is the film in which Godard was given the opportunity to nearly work the big budget Hollywood-style film that he had always dreamed of.  Working with one of the most popular woman in the planet, Brigitte Bardot and the talented Michel Piccoli and to work alongside his favorite director Fritz Lang.  It seemed as if ""Contempt"" would be the film that would generate the highest buzz and a dream that would be realized.The fact is that ""Contempt"" is a popular Godard film especially for cinema fans who are appreciative of Godard oeuvre.  But the film didn't do well in Europe nor did it make money in the box office.  In fact, the film received 50/50 reviews of from film critics who loved it and those who disliked it and found it too pretentious.Personally, I found ""Contempt"" to be a wonderful and artistic film from Godard in which he was put on the pedestal by producers especially American film and distributor Joseph E. Levine who appears to have probably never watched a Godard film and only known his name through the popularity of the French New Wave.  The fact is that Godard does his films his way and his style and so, ""Contempt"" behind-the-scenes was much more messier than anyone including Godard would ever realize.Brigitte Bardot was not known for her acting but yet she was the most popular woman in the world.  She was defiant, rebellious and like Godard, did things her way.  And for those familiar with Godard films, his style is not to rehearse and usually keep his talents in the dark by not giving them a script.  But at the time, Bardot was looking for the role to get away from the kitschy films that she had worked previously and wanted to be taken seriously as an actress.  Problem is that she brought an entourage that the filmmaker and the crew had problems dealing with, she also brought paparazzi that Godard never had to deal with and because she was treated so specially, her rule was that she would not film early in the morning which caused problems with scheduling.As for actor Jack Palance, he came into the film not knowing much about Jean-Luc Godard but knew about the novel that the film was adapted from and was excited about his role until he found out that Godard changed the screenplay which upset Palance and also not used to Godard's style of directing, Palance was infuriated by Godard just telling him what to do and making sure that he didn't do what the director suggested until he received a reason why he was doing what he was being told.  This was not Hollywood as Palance was sure to find out and this added more stress to the filmmaker and the crew.In fact, Palance told L'Express, ""We never know in advance what we're going to do.  There's almost no dialogue.  It's the worst experience I've ever had! It's madness!"".But behind-the-scenes, the marriage turmoil between Jean-Luc Godard and wife Anna Karina was taking shape and the screenplay of ""Le Mepris"" (Contempt) was starting to become a film about Jean-Luc Godard and his life with Anna Karina.  As Godard films are known to project the director into his characters, ""Contempt"" was a film in which Michel Piccoli was playing Godard and Bardot was playing Karina.Piccoli said in an interview with ""Realites"", ""The male character in `Contempt' is Godard.  He wanted me to wear his tie, his hat and his shoes"".  Godard's cinematographer Raoul Coutard even said, ""I am convinced that in `Contempt' he is trying to explain something to his wife.""In fact, the words that were used in the film were words used by Karina.  The dark wig that Bardot wore in the film was similar to the black wig that Karina wore in ""Vivre sa Vie"" and the exclamation point that ""Contempt"" was a film that embodied Godard and Karina's relationship was Bardot's comment in ""Initiales B.B."" in which she said, ""Godard told me that I had to be filmed with my back to the camera, and to walk away from it, straight ahead.  I rehearsed, and he wasn't happy.  I asked him why.  Because he said, my manner was not the same as Anna Karina's!"".Needless to say, the harmonious featurette on the DVD by Jacques Rozier showing the happy working relationship between Godard and Bardot was certainly specious.  And to make things even more complicated that after the film was made, the producers were not satisfied as they wanted more nudity, more of Brigitte Bardot's derriere in the film.  After so much arguments and even certain version of the film in which Godard's name was taken off the credits (it's important to note that producer Carlo Ponti was trying to get Francois Truffaut in replacing Godard, especially since Godard was not replying to producer/distributor Levine's telegrams in to making the film more erotic.So, in essence ""Contempt"" was a not only a film that showed contempt onscreen, behind-the-scenes of the making of the film, there was plenty of it.  This was Godard's test and perhaps his only taste of creating a film with such a high budget (despite most of that budget going towards Bardot, Palance and Lang) and once again, Godard showing that he would buckle to his producers and would create the film that he wanted.  No compromises.The fact is that ""Contempt"" because of the nature of what went on behind-the-scenes in making this film, is a sore point to Godard and even the producers, especially Levine and both men are in awe of how popular this film is still received by cinema fans of today.  Nearly 50-years since the release of this film in the theaters, the interest in ""Contempt"" has not waned.  More and more people who have discovered Godard's oeuvre have found ""Contempt"" to perfectly show the conflict of a husband and wife and it seems improbable for many people to think that one can have contempt towards a significant other in the manner that is displayed in the film but the fact is, Godard was having these issues in his personal life.His connection to cinema is his passion, as the character of Paul.  His life is embodied in cinema but their significant others are not.  And for ""Contempt"", the film deviates from the novel as the premise of the screenwriter working on the film ""Odyssey"" has now been changed.  In ""Contempt"", Paul is the rewriter of the film that is being shot by Fritz Lang.  In the novel, the director uses ""Odyssey"" to showcase the deterioration of the couple but not in ""Contempt"".  The dictator-ish American producer is the one wanting to make ""Contempt"" commercially viable.  As Godard was using Paul and Camille as characters based on him and Karina, was Prokosch his way of giving the middle finger to American producer/distributor Joseph E. Levine?  Quite possibly.And that is what I enjoyed about ""Contempt"" and Godard's filmmaking.  Although for ""Contempt"", the film was a compromise as Godard was literally pushed into the corner by the producers and had to compromise in trying to bring those erotic images of Bardot to the screen although not the way Levine had wanted it, but this was Godard's recognition that the years of the Hollywood film that he once watched and the artistic freedom that director's once had was no more.  The dream that he had always wanted to become part of as a fan of cinema was fully learned by the director that his entry to a big budget film in which have artistic freedom wasn't going to happen.But for those of us who watch this film and knowing what Godard was able to accomplish, especially with three angry producers and the talent he had been given, we can only judge what we see onscreen.  For Godard-ites, we recognize the pain and the breakdown of the relationship of Godard and Karina, like we recognize Godard dying at the hands of Karina twice in the film ""Made in U.S.A."".  I found this film to be visual poetry and a highlight in Godard's career.The DVD comes with plenty of special features and a wonderful commentary by film scholar Robert Stam and I know that there is a Blu-ray release by StudioCanal out in the market today and this Criterion Collection DVD edition is now out of print.  I have not personally watched the Blu-ray version of ""Contempt"" yet, so I can't comment on how it compares to the DVD version in picture quality (which is a given that that the Blu-ray will be better in PQ and AQ).But overall, ""Le Mepris"" (Contempt) is a film worthy of having in your cinema collection.  If you are a fan of Godard films, personally, this is a must-own film.  A wonderful DVD release from the Criterion Collection and is a release that I definitely recommend!",5,"Visually poetic and nearly 50-years later, still a fantastic film!",1276560000,"06 15,

590292,A3G77QXVTLRC6F,B00005JKPT,"Donny ""Some Dude""","[3, 5]","Contempt is Jean-Luc Godard's masterpiece, and quite possibly the best film of the 60s. The film has so many layers and meanings, one viewing is not enough. Similar in style to Antonioni's film trilogy of the 60s that started with L'Avventura (1960), Contempt beautifully tells the story of a marriage lost, and a journey fullfilled. The film takes place over a short period of time, and half of it is contained in the couple's apartment, yet the film has an epic feel as large as The Odyssey. Raoul Coutard's cinematography is nothing short of magnificant, Georges Delerue's score is one of the most haunting and exquisite in cinema, and the acting, especially by Bardot in a sublte performance, is top notch. Godard may not have embraced the CinemaScope look, but this film is evidence he knew how to use it. Contempt works on three levels: First as a breakdown of a marriage, second as a modern day re-telling of The Odyssey, and third as a stand in for the makers of the film; but either way you look at it Contempt is a beautiful, somewhat surreal masterpiece that stands with the best of cinema.",5,Contempt (1963) - Jean-Luc Godard,1128729600,"10 8, 2005",2005,1101,"['Contempt', 'Jean-Luc', 'Godard', 'masterpiece', 'quite', 'possibly', 'best', 'film', '60s', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'layers', 'meanings', 'one', 'viewing', 'not', 'enough', 'Similar', 'style', 'Antonioni', 'film', 'trilogy', '60s', 'started', ""L'Avventura"", '1960', 'Contempt', 'beautifully', 'story', 'marriage', 'lost', 'journey', 'fullfilled', 'film', 'place', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'half', 'contained', 'couple', 'apartment', 'film', 'epic', 'feel', 'as', 'large', 'Odyssey', 'Raoul', 'Coutard', 'cinematography', 'nothing', 'short', 'magnificant', 'Georges', 'Delerue', 'score', 'one', 'most', 'haunting', 'exquisite', 'cinema', 'acting', 'especially', 'Bardot', 'sublte', 'performance', 'top', 'notch', 'Godard', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'embraced', 'CinemaScope', 'look', 'film', 'evidence', 'knew', 'how', 'use', 'Contempt', 'three', 'levels', 'First', 'breakdown', 'marriage', 'second', 'modern', 'day', 're-telling', 'Odyssey', 'third', 'stand', 'makers', 'film', 'way', 'look', 'Contempt', 'beautiful', 'somewhat', 'surreal', 'masterpiece', 'best', 'cinema']",Contempt
590293,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B00005JKPT,Doug Anderson,"[9, 14]","Bardot is actually an excellent actress in this film. Her body gets a lot of attention and there are plenty of shots of her lying in the sun naked but she gives her character depth. Strangley enough when she walks around wearing a black wig she looks very plain, not at all like a movie star. Perhaps the most striking thing about this film is that though it was Godards first color film he manages to use color brilliantly. The film was shot in Italy and reminds me of a Michelangelo Antonioni film as it is a story of two lovers who fail to communicate and thus let their love slip away.Jack Palance is perfect as the headstrong producer who manipulates his director Fritz Lang (who plays himself),  as well as his writer (Michel Piccoli). Palance is the ultimate megalomaniacal producer who enjoys dominating others and manipulating them into doing whatever he wants. The confident and poised Lang acts like the master that he is, he never loses his cool and he copes with Palance's outrageous tantrums as if they were nothing at all, and we can see that despite Palance's constant intereference Lang will make the film that he wants. But the young, sensitive writer is made to feel like a whore. And this explains why he begins to treat his wife like a whore. Piccoli does not seem to want to admit what he is doing but  he seems to push his wife into the arms of Palance intentionally so she too will feel the way he does.  The script is based on an Alberto Moravia novel and this is a classic Moravia scenario.  Moravia was fascinated with prostitutes and so was Godard -- ie My Life to Live.The husband and wife both feel like whores and so they feel contempt for themselves as well as each other. The husband wonders aloud why commerce must invade every aspect of our lives and by that he means both art and love but he seems powerless to win his wife back. Though the film began with the loving couple laying in bed and whispering to each other, it ends on quite a different note.  Palance, Lang, and Piccoli all interpret Homers Odyssey in their own way. Each views the relationship between Odysseus and Penelope according to their own life situation. Palance and Piccoli cease to find the film all that interesting, they are only interested in the battle for Bardot.  Lang alone remains focused on the actual film. For Lang the world of the Greeks is too far removed from our own experince of the world and so he reinvents the story so it will resonate with modern audiences and he does so by brilliantly quoting from select texts (Dante, Holderlein)and thus he tells the tale as if it were taking place in the world we know today--as Lang reimagines the tale each scene takes on new significance.  And of course the way Lang thinks and works sounds a lot like the way Godard thinks and works.An excellent film which can be appreciated by Godard fans and a good place to start for those not familiar with Godard.",5,"Godard and Lang, Bardot and Capri",1071360000,"12 14, 2003",2003,2923,"['Bardot', 'actually', 'excellent', 'actress', 'film', 'body', 'lot', 'attention', 'are', 'plenty', 'shots', 'lying', 'sun', 'naked', 'character', 'depth', 'Strangley', 'enough', 'when', 'wearing', 'black', 'wig', 'very', 'plain', 'not', 'movie', 'star', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'striking', 'thing', 'film', 'was', 'Godards', 'first', 'color', 'film', 'use', 'color', 'brilliantly', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Italy', 'Michelangelo', 'Antonioni', 'film', 'story', 'two', 'lovers', 'who', 'fail', 'communicate', 'thus', 'let', 'love', 'slip', 'away.Jack', 'Palance', 'perfect', 'headstrong', 'producer', 'who', 'director', 'Fritz', 'Lang', 'who', 'as', 'well', 'writer', 'Michel', 'Piccoli', 'Palance', 'ultimate', 'megalomaniacal', 'producer', 'who', 'dominating', 'others', 'manipulating', 'doing', 'confident', 'poised', 'Lang', 'acts', 'master', 'never', 'cool', 'Palance', 'outrageous', 'tantrums', 'were', 'nothing', 'can', 'see', 'Palance', 'constant', 'intereference', 'Lang', 'will', 'make', 'film', 'young', 'sensitive', 'writer', 'made', 'feel', 'whore', 'why', 'treat', 'wife', 'whore', 'Piccoli', 'not', 'seem', 'want', 'admit', 'what', 'doing', 'push', 'wife', 'arms', 'Palance', 'intentionally', 'so', 'too', 'will', 'feel', 'way', 'script', 'based', 'Alberto', 'Moravia', 'novel', 'classic', 'Moravia', 'scenario', 'Moravia', 'was', 'fascinated', 'prostitutes', 'so', 'was', 'Godard', 'ie', 'My', 'Life', 'Live.The', 'husband', 'wife', 'feel', 'whores', 'so', 'feel', 'contempt', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'husband', 'wonders', 'aloud', 'why', 'commerce', 'must', 'invade', 'aspect', 'lives', 'art', 'love', 'powerless', 'win', 'wife', 'back', 'film', 'began', 'loving', 'couple', 'laying', 'bed', 'whispering', 'other', 'different', 'note', 'Palance', 'Lang', 'Piccoli', 'interpret', 'Homers', 'Odyssey', 'own', 'way', 'relationship', 'Odysseus', 'Penelope', 'according', 'own', 'life', 'situation', 'Palance', 'Piccoli', 'cease', 'find', 'film', 'interesting', 'are', 'only', 'interested', 'battle', 'Bardot', 'Lang', 'alone', 'focused', 'actual', 'film', 'Lang', 'world', 'Greeks', 'too', 'far', 'removed', 'own', 'experince', 'world', 'so', 'story', 'will', 'resonate', 'modern', 'audiences', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'quoting', 'select', 'texts', 'Dante', 'Holderlein', 'thus', 'tale', 'were', 'taking', 'place', 'world', 'know', 'today', 'Lang', 'tale', 'scene', 'new', 'significance', 'course', 'way', 'Lang', 'thinks', 'lot', 'way', 'Godard', 'works.An', 'excellent', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'appreciated', 'Godard', 'fans', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'not', 'familiar', 'Godard']",Contempt
590294,A35AMPDFAB8JLT,B00005JKPT,Edmonson,"[7, 8]","""Contempt""(1963) is directed by Jean-Luc Godard. The film is interesting in that it encircles a given second in time when Camille Javal (Brigette Bardot) looses her love for Paul Javal (Michel Piccoli),  unlike most films that would follow a linear progression from love to contempt. When Paul realizes his error it is too late and from then on he is constantly seen out of sync with Camille.As with many of Godard's films this one is also about a film within a film, or a film about film. Fritz Lang (Metropolis, M) acts the part of a director late in his life who is forced to compromise himself to commercial film in order to make a living. Jeremy Prokosch (Jack Palance) is the American producer who is only concerned with making money and showing off his female actors assets just as Godard was asked by his producers with respect to Bardot. The movie Fritz Lang is making is an adaptation of Homer's Odyssey that Paul is hired to rework so as to make it more commercially viable. The classical characters of Penelope, Odysseus and Poseidon parallel Camille, Paul, and Jeremy. Paul seems to understand and relate his predicament with Camille to Penelope interpreting that Camille has lost her love for him because she believes that he has tried to leave her, just as Odysseus left Penelope for many years to journey the world because he was possibly trying to avoid her. Whether this is true or not, Paul only half heartedly tries to regain her love for him which only serves to further widen the rift between them. Camille never really comes out and says why she has lost her love for him and we are left trying to put the pieces together wondering if this is merely a lover's game or not. There is a curious balance between Paul's interest in her, and his indifference to her, that inevitably seems to push her away from him. Maybe she is just too young for him, or he is not stimulated intellectually by her, we don't know, but she is instinctively repelled by this indifference which crystalized at that moment, that second, when Paul seemed to push Camille to ride alone with Jeremy on the short  drive to his house.This is the French release of the film which is multilingual with English subtitles, as opposed to the American or Italian releases which were dubbed. This is also the full 103 minute version, whereas the Italian version was cut down to 82 minutes. The restored print looks very good overall with only a few blemishes. The blu-ray disc is in 1080p with CinemaScope 2.35:1. The DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 may sound a bit brash to some ears but this is evidently how the film has always sounded, and I merely had the volume adjusted down a bit from where I normally watch a film. There are many special features, such as an introduction by Colin MacCabe, and a couple of documentaries about the film: ""Once Upon a Time There Was...Contempt"", and ""Contempt...Tenderly"". There is also a conversation with Fritz Lang, and in ""The Dinosaur and the Baby"" a discussion between Fritz Lang, and Jean-Luc Godard, as well as a booklet with an essay by Ginette Vincendeau.",4,Encircling a moment in time....,1270425600,"04 5, 2010",2010,3082,"['Contempt', '1963', 'directed', 'Jean-Luc', 'Godard', 'film', 'interesting', 'given', 'second', 'time', 'when', 'Camille', 'Javal', 'Brigette', 'Bardot', 'love', 'Paul', 'Javal', 'Michel', 'Piccoli', 'most', 'films', 'would', 'follow', 'linear', 'progression', 'love', 'contempt', 'When', 'Paul', 'error', 'too', 'late', 'then', 'constantly', 'seen', 'sync', 'Camille.As', 'many', 'Godard', 'films', 'one', 'also', 'film', 'film', 'film', 'film', 'Fritz', 'Lang', 'Metropolis', 'M', 'part', 'director', 'late', 'life', 'who', 'forced', 'compromise', 'commercial', 'film', 'order', 'make', 'living', 'Jeremy', 'Prokosch', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'American', 'producer', 'who', 'only', 'concerned', 'making', 'money', 'showing', 'off', 'female', 'actors', 'assets', 'just', 'Godard', 'was', 'asked', 'producers', 'respect', 'Bardot', 'movie', 'Fritz', 'Lang', 'making', 'adaptation', 'Homer', 'Odyssey', 'Paul', 'hired', 'rework', 'so', 'make', 'more', 'commercially', 'viable', 'classical', 'characters', 'Penelope', 'Odysseus', 'Poseidon', 'parallel', 'Camille', 'Paul', 'Jeremy', 'Paul', 'understand', 'relate', 'predicament', 'Camille', 'Penelope', 'interpreting', 'Camille', 'lost', 'love', 'tried', 'leave', 'just', 'Odysseus', 'left', 'Penelope', 'many', 'years', 'journey', 'world', 'was', 'possibly', 'trying', 'avoid', 'true', 'not', 'Paul', 'only', 'heartedly', 'tries', 'regain', 'love', 'only', 'further', 'widen', 'rift', 'Camille', 'never', 'really', 'out', 'why', 'lost', 'love', 'are', 'left', 'trying', 'put', 'pieces', 'together', 'wondering', 'merely', 'lover', 'game', 'not', 'curious', 'balance', 'Paul', 'interest', 'indifference', 'inevitably', 'push', 'away', 'Maybe', 'just', 'too', 'young', 'not', 'stimulated', 'intellectually', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'instinctively', 'repelled', 'indifference', 'crystalized', 'moment', 'second', 'when', 'Paul', 'seemed', 'push', 'Camille', 'ride', 'alone', 'Jeremy', 'short', 'drive', 'house.This', 'French', 'release', 'film', 'multilingual', 'English', 'subtitles', 'opposed', 'American', 'Italian', 'releases', 'were', 'dubbed', 'also', 'full', '103', 'minute', 'version', 'Italian', 'version', 'was', 'cut', 'down', '82', 'minutes', 'restored', 'print', 'very', 'good', 'overall', 'only', 'few', 'blemishes', 'blu-ray', 'disc', '1080p', 'CinemaScope', '2.35:1', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '2.0', 'may', 'sound', 'bit', 'brash', 'ears', 'evidently', 'how', 'film', 'always', 'sounded', 'merely', 'had', 'volume', 'adjusted', 'down', 'bit', 'where', 'normally', 'watch', 'film', 'are', 'many', 'special', 'features', 'such', 'introduction', 'Colin', 'MacCabe', 'couple', 'documentaries', 'film', 'Once', 'Time', 'Was', 'Contempt', 'Contempt', 'Tenderly', 'also', 'conversation', 'Fritz', 'Lang', 'Dinosaur', 'Baby', 'discussion', 'Fritz', 'Lang', 'Jean-Luc', 'Godard', 'as', 'well', 'booklet', 'essay', 'Ginette', 'Vincendeau']",Contempt

It's slow-moving by today's standards and I doubt many younger filmgoers would have the patience to sit through many of its lengthy sequences, where admittedly, little ""happens"" on screen. That's Godard's style and what gives his movies their unique approach. That's the charm and this film's full of it. The conversations and communications between the characters in this film seem so believable and ""genuine"" that it's hard to immagine this is performance by actors reading a script. It seems too improvised and natural and ""documentary"" in style, that you could almost accuse Jean Luc Godard of making ""fake"" reality TV years before its time. (It's much better than reality TV however in that Godard's characters are far more exotic and interesting).This DVD is presented in a tight 2.85:1 widescreen ratio from Cinemascope film in full color. The colors are vibrant and Godard makes excellent use of the panoramic widecsreen composition in all his shots. It's a visual treat throughout.

And Breathless is one of my all-time favorite films.Why don't I like this one?First, it relies too much on technology to convey its message.  We are treated to grand outdoor shots of the regions surrounding Rome and Capri.  Somehow this seascape is supposed to represent the visions beheld by Odysseus upon his return to Greece (among other things), but anyone who has visited the area will tell you right away that Italy isn't Greece; the two landscapes are markedly different.Second is the moronic score by Georges Delerue.  This was a composer who wrote generally interesting scores (including the disorienting one for Hiroshima, mon amour).  In this case, he sounds like he's trying to emulate Mahler, while lacking Mahler's depth and genius for orchestration.  And while the theme is pretty, it is played over and over and over.  And over.  Again and again.  Barf.Third, the performances are poor.  Brigitte Bardot plays a superficial character with utter indifference.  This is a no-no.  There has to be something to draw us into examining this character, and it just isn't there.  And Bardot doesn't even look all that good here.  Her hair is bleached a terrible color and is continually falling into her face.As for the other principals, Jack Palance (who wasn't that great an actor, admittedly) gives a wooden and feeble performance as a big-shot producer, who supposedly has no problem seducing the Bardot character (yeah, right).  Michel Piccoli, who was great at portraying edgy and unsavory characters, walks through his role as the milquetoast husband of the Bardot character.  Fritz Lang plays himself and doesn't do too badly, though he obviously is at the end of his tether here.Someday I'd like to read the underlying Alberto Moravia novel that served as the basis of this picture.  My guess is that there will be a shrewd examination of the tenuousness of relationships and the critical junctures therein.  For now, I'll have to take it on faith, as it's not in this film.What's to like?  I give one-and-a-half stars for the ironic commentary on the egocentricity and theatricality inherent in big producers and popular movie actors.  I'll give half a star for the gorgeous shots of the Italian coast.

As far as intellect goes, the most you hope for with Godard is a ten-minute Maoist harangue interesting now only for showing the then-zeitgeist.  As for brilliant, ground-breaking film-making, the same applies - plenty of student films have adopted the same techniques as Godard just to save money or out of pure innocence.  If you want groundbreaking, you want Kurosawa or Tarkovsky or Von Trier.  What is great about Godard are scenes like the improvised caf&eacute; dance in Bande a Part or the crazy ""murder"" sequences in Pierrot, scenes which are outrageously witty and cool and original but actually quite simple, like the Beatles singing ""I am the Walrus, woooooh.""Back to the point:  Unlike his Pierrot, Bande a Part or Une Femme est une Femme in particular, this film seriously lacks charm.  The whole thing has a sour mood about it, the actors really look like they have no idea what they are up to and just want it to be over - Palance above all, forced to play a madly egotistical meglomaniac film producer with lines that would look second-rate in a primary school pantomime.  Bardot and Piccoli get through it, but you can sense the tension.  Lang looks like he's on Valium.  No doubt realising that his film was getting a bit irritating as it labours away with tiresome lack of subtlety at a domestic rupture (see same in Femme est une Femme for how it can be done, but this time con brio), Godard goes for broke by repeatedly introducing the mawkish background music all over the place (you can almost see him with an adolescent smirk on his face as he lays it on) to the point of making you groan.Another thing I frankly don't understand is this:  virtually any crit you read will tell you how this was Godard's first and last flirtation with big-budget movie-making.  Big budget?  It's about the cheapest movie I've ever seen.  For example:  any producer worth his salt would be surrounded with an entourage and chauffeurs.  This guy can barely run to one secretary and drives himself around in a medium-budget Alfa.  Likewise Lang.  At the Villa Malaparte, a spectacular site on Capri, we see some scenes with a reception being laid out in the back.  Look carefully:  the ""caterers"" consist of one old man fumbling around with some plates.  The paint is peeling off the walls in the living room.  The entire film crew working on the film-within-the-film seems to consist of about three people, and they're not even around most of the time.  Best of all, look carefully at the car crash in the final reel.  Apparently they couldn't even afford to total the Alfa, so it's a mock up.Art films are tricky things: the best of them can change your life and lift you to inspiration and wonder.  The worst are not worth the celluloid they're made on.  But to read all the critics, you sometimes have a hell of a job deciding which is which.

Christal,"[0, 0]","Jean-Luc Godard's Contempt is abstract at times, analystic at most, and full of the contemptuous vibes that deliver the film its title, and, indeed, consistently interesting entry in the Godard catalog of work.  It examines a lead character in a bit of a sense like how Fellini examined a lead in 8 1/2, except that while in that he toyed and illuminated his fantasies about his struggles in filmmaking process, Godard slums in it, though with a carefully tuned attitude and style. He knows he's making an ""art"" film as much as he's making a ""commercial"" film, and that adds to its appeal. Like a good number of his films it's off putting at times, but the way the characters look into the film within the film, in this case the Odyssey, as well as they essentially do for this one, Goddard has made a fascinating hybrid on the workings of Hollywood.His lead is played by Michael Piccoli, who like Fellini's Mastorianni is the torn screenwriter, torn in this case in three directions- one by a commercial producer (Jack Palance) who wants the production to be epic but has many reservations about the craft; another by a legendary director (all the more so since Lang is playing himself) who is only interested in the art of it, like when he views slides and shots of old Greek statues and such, and Palance chucks the film around the room; the last by his wife, played by the beautiful (if slightly depressing) Bridget Bardot who has as many or more inner demons as her husband.  Their conversation, which lasts a longish if hypnotic half an hour, gives Bardot her spotlight in the picture.Like an Odyssey of sorts the film becomes, lending itself to Godard's focus on the aspect of the idea of characters breaking down, and how the atmosphere he creates is one that can understandably make anyone crack.

590305,ATZONTF6SUZEP,B00005JKPT,Matthew Patton,"[9, 30]","If Jean-Luc Godard hated commercial film producers, why did he make a movie for them?  To make some adolescent point about how he, The Brave Artist, would never be cowed by the vulgar likes of Carlo Ponti or Joseph Levine, I suppose.  And to prove that he could get  Brigitte Bardot as naked, or naked-er, than her ex-husband Roger Vadim.Somehow, though, I suspect that even Vadim would have done better by this material than Godard.  After all, he has a good cast (Bardot included), good source material (a novel by Albert Moravia), and the services of Raoul Coutard, one of the best cinematographers in the history of film.

In this film, with a larger budget than usual he tries out bigger scenes and some new equipment from Hollywood.  This includes Cinemascope and Technicolor.  He balances all this new stuff with an old director in a key role, essentially playing himself.  German genius Fritz Lang is shooting a movie that recreates Homer's ""The Odyssey.""  His screenwriter Paul (Michel Piccoli) has two problems.  He and the American producer Jeremy Prokosch (Jack Palance) do not see eye to eye on what should be in the film.  The other problem is with his beautiful wife Camille (Brigitte Bardot) who is ""falling out of love"" with her husband.  Bardot, who was such a sensation in ""And God Created Woman"", is admittedly stunning and can truly act, but Goddard seems preoccupied with showing her lying nude on her stomach for no other reason than he can.  Nothing wrong with that of course, but there is more to a clothing free Bardot than her butt.The various vistas of Capri are beautifully shot and the color in this Blu ray disc is excellent.  Unfortunately for this viewer the film is an utter bore.  Palance overacts as he is often does.  Lang is a great director, but not so much an actor.  I give him props however for speaking German, English, French and Italian in the film. Godard wants to be self reflecting or perhaps self meditating but to me he must have been self medicating.

The film also makes fun of lots of ideas, filmic conventions, artists in general -- and itself. But Godard's subtlety allows these myriad themes to flow through the story without encumbering it. One never feels he's watching an intellectual exercise or the tedious result of a filmmaker's auto-eroticism. Which is not to say the film does not self-reference or geek out in the ways ""artsy"" filmmakers often like to geek out, but Godard always tempers these conventions or anti-conventions with a dollop of irony to purify them of any nauseating self-importance. Godard ridicules the egoistic pompousness of the writer, director and producer in the film -- each respectively enamored of his own interpretation of ""The Odyssey,"" to forward his own vision. At the same time, the film suggests that without the inflated artist's ego, great art wouldn't exist. At the filming of CONTEMPT, Godard was already heralded as the founder of the French New Wave and widely considered to be one of the greatest filmmakers who ever lived, but the cynical turn of the knife with which Godard treats the idolatry of artists and their visions belies a lens of gleeful irony with which Godard suggests might be applied to his own work.  All that being said, at the end of the day what really makes it great is the simple tragic love story that pushes the story along.

590311,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,B00005JKPT,Randy Keehn,"[5, 8]","I'm always interested in seeing films with a strong reputation.  I had seen a previous movie by Godard (""Breathless"") which left me underwhelmed but I decided to try again.  I had a rough idea of the plot of ""Contempt"" and I was interested that Jack Palance was in a starring role.  I was confused by the artistic painting that is shown with the film's title.  It looked to me like the face of Christ on the Cross.  Seeing it on a large screen, I realized that it was just the opposite.What is the purpose of ""Contempt""?  From reviews I have glanced through, this movie is Godard's expression of his opinion of Hollywood films (and the one-word title of the film is a more succinct expression of the same).  I guess the abusive, mindless, domination of the character of the producer (played by Palance) was the key to this expression of distaste.  However, while I can appreciate the sentiment, I felt Godard showed his own shortcomings by portraying the producer so stereotypically.  With a man of Palance's talent, a more in-depth portrayal would, in my opinion, enhance the point rather than trivialize it.  The footage we get from the film-within-a-film is certainly one I wouldn't care to see.  That may have been the point but why?  I was looking forward to seeing Fritz Lang but that was anticlimatical as well.  The one aspect of ""Contempt"" that I found compelling was the breakdown of the marriage of the characters played by Bridgette Bardot and Michel Piccoli.  That part drew me in and, while I could only guess at the reasoning behind the breakup, I certainly was able to sense the inbalance of their relationship.  I suppose that this was a statement that Hollywood films convey a lot of shallow emotion.  Granted.  However, I prefer to get more in return for giving such a film my own emotional involvement.  I have seen references to films that reviewers cite as movies that need to be seen at least several times before they can truly be appreciated.  The irony of ""Contempt"" is that it left me with no interest in watching it again unlike the Hollywood productions that I do watch repeatedly.  Some would say that statement was a comment on me.

Godard challenges the limitations of cinema in aspiring to render ideas normally reserved for print or, at a stretch, the stage onto the screen.  Here he dares to present Michel Piccoli as a modern day Ulysses - so Godard expects the audience to engage with his work much like a reader might with a work of discursive philosophy, or a satiric play, or with James Joyce.  Yet the work itself is paradigmatically cinematic, with absolutely stunning cinematography and carefully considered use of sound.*As with literary forms throughout the twentieth century, Contempt is overtly self-reflexive.  It also delights in references to its influences, which are many, prime being icons of cinema history.  Fritz Lang, of course, is a character in the film - his presence is authoratative, immediately raising questions as to the status of any of his lines - is it Lang himself speaking, or is he simply 'acting', recounting Godard's lines.  Of further interest in this Criterion edition is an interview between Godard and Lang from 1967 - their interaction is as charming as it is revealing - above all, their mutual passion for film is evident, as is their vexed, but by no means simplistic, relationship with film's role as entertainment or 'divertissement'.*The broad satire of Hollywood, as embodied in the stylized persona of Jack Palance, is one concern of the film.  This refers back to the issue of entertainment, and the question of for whom is the film made.  Thus we have Palance at one point replying to Lang and Piccoli, ""Whenever I hear the word culture I bring out my cheque book.""  He goes on to write the cheque using his attractive female assistant as a table - make what you will of what this suggests of Hollywood's attitude to women and to its Faustian control of money.*Bardot's presence is just as conscious as that of Lang.  Is she a modern day icon comparable to the women who influenced the events of Greek epics?  Quite possibly.  The story of the Odyssey might best be encapsulated by a quote from Lang in the film itself, pointedly directed against Palance - ""It's a fight of the individual against the circumstances - the eternal problem of the old Greeks.  I don't know if you are able to  understand it Jerry, I certainly hope you can, it's a fight against the gods.""*A brilliant film and a brilliant feast of ideas.

The American film producer and tycoon, Jeremy Prokosch (Jack Palance), has offered him a job as screenwriter of 'The Odyssey,' to be directed by then veteran German-American filmmaker Fritz Lang (played by Fritz Lang!).Paul sells out, signs the contract with Prokosch and earns the never ending contempt of his wife, who drifts into a liaison with Jerry--not so clear anyway...Obviously, Prokosch is the Great Vulgarian Producer... He wants Lang to direct 'The Odyssey' because ""a German, Schliemann, discovered Troy."" Prokosch buys and sells mens' souls... He rushes around the film studio in a flashy red sports car, and reads stupid and pretentious maxims from a red book he carries in his breast pocket...The story of the dissolution of the Javals' marriage and Camille's contempt for Paul is entwined with the legend of Ulysses, and also with a sort of documentary look at what it's like to make a movie: the compromises, the idiocy, the boredom, and the fatigue...There are references to film and film-making throughout the motion picture: posters on walls for Howard Hawks' ""Hatari"" and Hitchcock's ""Psycho,"" brief looks at the inside of a movie studio, and the goings-on in a screening room... But perhaps the most interesting and mystical element in this film are its first and final shots...On Godard's instructions we are compelled to point inwards, to submit, to think, and to contemplate...

Godard undermines the epic Franscope scale with an intimate look at an arrogant producer's attempt to make a modern version of Homer's Odyssey.Jack Palance is terrific as the combative producer and the great Fritz Lang essentially plays himself as the vetaran director of the film within the film. In a serious but still sex-pot turn, Brigitte Bardot is the pouty director's wife who's fed up with their termagant relationship. And at the center of the conflict is the screenwriter who's trying to please everyone.This extremely entertaining film with lots of in-jokes about movies is Godard's take on fame, art, and love itself.The loaded two disc set features a pristine transfer with a wonderful commentary by Robert Stam.

590320,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00005JKPT,Turfseer,"[3, 5]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***For those who were utterly bored by Jean Luc Godard's 'Contempt', I urge you to watch the Criterion Collection's version, with the DVD commentary by Professor Robert Stam turned on. Stam's commentary actually explains what Godard was trying to do in the film and is not only a fascinating analysis of the plot but a wholly worthwhile digression as to the history of the film's production. In no way, however, do I agree with Professor Stam's unqualified praise of its director, Mr. Godard, as well as his implied conclusion that 'Contempt' is an important film in cinematic history.As Stam points out, 'Contempt' was relatively a big budget production in relation to Godard's other 'New Wave' films during his heyday. The film wouldn't have been made without the presence of Brigitte Bardot who at that time was considered a sex symbol. The producers made it clear to Godard that there had to be at least three scenes where Bardot appeared in the nude. The anti-establishment Godard agreed to a 'compromise' and inserted Bardot nude scenes at the beginning,middle and end of the picture. Working under those restrictions, Godard turned the tables on his chiefly American backers ('Contempt' was a joint Italian/American production) by ensuring that there was nothing 'lurid' about the nude scenes. Quite the contrary, Godard mocks Hollywood's obsession with sex by having Bardot intellectualize her sexual endowments in a bland bedtime conversation between the principal characters, Camille (Bardot) and Paul (Michel Piccoli). Later, Camille is seen as an ordinary housewife in the bathtub, reading a biography of Fritz Lang.The 'Contempt' plot is rather simple. Paul, a novelist/playwright is hired by an American producer, Jeremy Prokosch (played by Jack Palance) to re-write the script of a film based on Homer's ""The Odyssey'. The film within a film is directed by real-life director Fritz Lang who plays himself. Godard creates a straw man in the character of Prokosch who he depicts as a boorish American, obsessed with money and sex. In a twist on Nazi Propaganda Minster Goebbel's famous utterance, Prokosch proclaims, ""Whenever I hear the word culture, I pull out my checkbook"". His one-dimensional villainy is further illustrated when he's seen leering during one of the film-within-a-film dailies of a nude, mermaid-like woman, swimming in the ocean. It's no accident that Godard cast Palance as the repulsive producer, as Palance was known for his tough guy roles at the time.If Prokosch is your one-dimensional villain, Godard's 'hero' is director Lang. In real-life, Lang was known for his 'tough love' approach in directing actors but none of his irascible personality is on display here. Rather, he's placed on a pedestal and merely acts as a platform for Godard's views on art and culture. Lang's 'all-knowing' interpretation of Ulysses as organically linked to nature is contrasted with Paul's relationship with Camille, which is doomed to failure.Most of 'Act 2' of 'Contempt' involves the 'quarrel' scene between Paul and Camille. Paul is depicted as an imperfect, if not failed, Ulysses. As usual, Godard seeks to subvert typical Hollywood conventions by deemphasizing the dramatic conflicts between the two principals. At the height of their quarrel, Godard employs a slow tracking shot, which symbolizes the distance between Paul and Camille. Godard deflates the audience's expectations further when Paul puts a gun inside his jacket but never uses it. Finally, Camille keeps telling Paul that he despises him but never provides a decent explanation. The audience is left hanging and one can imagine Godard smiling behind the camera murmuring to himself, 'aha, you were expecting another typical Hollywood resolution, but you will not get it from me'!In the end, Godard's agitprop cinema is all style over substance. His film is filled with 'gimmicks' that many well-known critics and filmmakers hail as hallmarks of bold experimentation. So in the 'audition scene', where the sound is continually turned on and off, that's an example, according to Professor Stam, of Brechtian distancing. In order to avoid the tendency toward voyeurism, ""art should display the principles of its own construction"". Even the 'grand' climax of 'Contempt' ends with an intentional deflation. Prokopsch and Camille are killed in a car accident but we never see the crash. Instead, we're treated to a glimpse of Camille's farewell letter to Paul, stock audio of a car crash and then a final shot of the victims unnaturally facing in opposite directions with their convertible slightly mangled between the tires of a tractor trailer.Despite his love for film noir, Godard's anti-American bent was evident way back when he was the film critics' darling. Godard reserves his greatest contempt for the Hollywood studio system. In contrast, in the idealized figure of Lang, European culture emerges triumphant. Now in his later days, Godard's anti-Americanism seems to have become more pronounced (see NY Times and Roger Ebert's review of Godard's 2001 film Eloge de l'amour) as well as displaying marked tendencies of anti-Semitism (see the article, ""Jean-Luc Godard, Robert Brasillach, and Anti-Semitism: Some observations"" by Glenn Kenny).'Contempt' is worth seeing just so one can note the lengths Godard went to promote his rather simplistic view of so-called Hollywood 'corruption'. Godard's put down of film convention is effected without the necessary good-natured ribbing and all his 'gimmicks' can't hide the fact that his contemptuous world view is fraught with half-truths and an adolescent piety.",2,Godard's Brechtian 'distancing' can't save slow-moving agitprop critique of Hollywood producers,1306022400,"05 22, 2011",2011,5647,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain',
