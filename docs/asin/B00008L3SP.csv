Drawing from Saxo Grammaticus rather than Shakespeare, the movie aims to present the Hamlet story in a more historical context.  This is quite laudable, and certainly the producers had a more than talented cast at their disposal, but this was an opportunity completely squandered.  I can only assume that this was done on a shoestring budget, since there seem to be only 2 dozen extras available at any given time & the battle scenes are nothing short of laughable.  Still, one can tell a good story and manage to pinch the pennies.  The story told here is disjointed, poorly constructed, and far too abbreviated.  85 minutes simply does not allow for the development of either plot or character, and the movie suffers badly as a result.  This was a huge disappointment, and only the performances by Byrne & Mirren begin to salvage it.

Knouse,"[7, 14]","After watching this extremely low-budget film of a tale based on the historical story of ""Hamlet"" it was easy to see where all the money went: to the cast members.  The cast is loaded with potential.  It includes Gabriel Byrne, Helen Mirren, Christian Bale, a youthful looking Kate Beckinsale (she has come a long, long way since this film), and a plethora of the kind of actors that make you ask, ""What other movie did I see that actor in?""  But the rest of the film fails to live up to this monumental promise.  For much of the movie it looks and feels like a made-for-television romp through medieval times.  It has a small cast of haggard-looking extras in peasant clothing, royalty that, if not for the crowns they wore, would be indistinguishable from the common herd, and some very predictable and flawed direction. The followers of the king, peasantry included, number about thirty in total and they all live in this small wooden village.  The director makes the mistake of using a large amount of voice-over narration to propel the story, which by the end was whittled down to about 90 minutes of Masterpiece Theater shot in the countryside.  One scene has Hamlet dashing from a buring hall, sword in hand, but when he rounds the corner of a building his sword is missing; cut to the following scene of Hamlet confronting the new king, his murderous uncle, and the sword reappears in his hand.  That kind of blatantly poor film editing is unforgivable.  The acting ranges from good to passable, but no amount of thespian zeal could have or did save this project from gradual diminishing returns.

Most are far more familiar with Shakespeare's 'Hamlet' than with his source material, notably the 'Gesta Danorum' (Book of the Danes) by Saxo Grammaticus. 'Royal Deceit' (released in Europe as 'Prince of Jutland') is based on the Gesta, in particular the tale of Amleth, a prince who discovers his uncle murdered his father for his crown and feigns madness to take revenge. Sound familiar? This version is far less complicated and more straightforward than Shakespeare's, but that doesn't make it inferior; rather, it's a refreshingly simple look at the Norse legend behind the famous play.That said, this film is definitely not for those who insist on sophisticated SFX, fast-paced action, and huge-scale battles. Combat is spare and usually represented by a couple of warriors on either side whacking each other with primitive swords, but realistically this is more in keeping with the sixth century than most of the epic-style stuff found in big-budget pictures. The costumes are extremely simple shifts and tunics, mostly, and are quite accurate for the period if not the most attractive things to look at. (Ethel's gown is a little form-fitting for the period, but then...it's Kate Beckinsale.) It was filmed on location in Denmark, and the scenery is really lovely.The film is also remarkable for the quality of the performances, which are first-rate all around. Astonishing talents Helen Mirren, Gabriel Byrne, and a young Christian Bale have most of the screen time, but look for truly enjoyable bit parts from the likes of Brian Cox, Kate Beckinsale, Tom Wilkinson, and - my favourite - Andy Serkis, better known as the man behind ""The Lord of the Rings'"" Gollum.The action can be slow-paced for those accustomed to quick, cut-and-run pictures, but the story unfolds nicely. The narration in particular keeps well in the spirit of the Gesta, and there are some truly enjoyable scenes, particularly the scenes between Amleth and his mum Geruth and any time Brian Cox's King Aethelwine of Britain is onscreen. (Nobody chews scenery better than Brian Cox.) One warning, though, is in order: since this was primarily a Danish-funded film, it has rather a lot of nudity in it by American standards, including some full-frontal shots.

Narrated by Oliver Fox (""Finding Neverland). Directed by Gabriel Axel (""Lela"").  Based on the Chronicle of Saxo Grammaticus (born 1150 Denmark, died 1220; ""The Normans"" (1976), ""The Red Mantle"" (1967)).Plot:The story of sixth-century royal intrigue in Denmark (tiny kingdom of Jutland), that includes a visit over to England.  The movie is based on an a book (chronicle) by Saxo Grammaticus (1150-1220 Denmark).  This book is an earlier Danish version of Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"" (in other words, a source story for ""Hamlet"").  In this version, the King and his eldest son are killed in a hunting party by two subjects (killed in turn by the King's brother).  The Queen is quite unhappy, and the Prince Amled, is made quite mad upon hearing the news (though we learn early on that it is a disguise assumed by the prince).Review:The movie has a nice opening sequence looking at the land of ""Jutland,"" combined by good music.  No mystery here, the opening shows the King's brother giving himself injuries and directing the placement of two dead subjects.  The buildings look right for the time, though I'm not an expert.  The clothing is drab, the sound is a little hard to hear, and no attempt is made to talk in anything other than modern English (except for the names).  Interesting, it appears that the women of the time prance around nude through the village to a bathhouse to use it together.There always seems to be some idiot at conspiracy gatherings who state that they don't want to join the conspiracy, and end up dead.  Too bad they had to include that clich&eacute; in this movie.  Also too bad is that most of the actors seemed quite passionless in their acting in the beginning, though it does pick up eventually.  When they say R for nudity, they really mean it, at least in the beginning (of course I'll later note that the beginning was boring, oddly enough).  A short movie in over all length, but it certainly seemed a lot longer.  Interesting to see the original story (if it is the original story), which has many similarities and differences between it and Hamlet (though it would be hard to list them without giving too much away).  While the beginning is rather boring, the movie does start to become interesting before it ends.
