Movie is about he Russian invasion of the former Soviet republic of Georgia.  A very pro Western country that wants into the EU and NATO.  The media enjoyed ignoring this little war at the time because we were bogged down in Iraq and Russia knew this when they decided to invade.  The people of Georgia were left to be slaughterd alone fighting Russian agression as this movie shows.  This movie deserves much more press than it is getting.

1463038,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005J4TLP2,Grady Harp,"[2, 5]","5 DAYS OF WAR is a disturbing film on many levels; it takes us into the bowels of an active war zone sharing the bloody ravenous hunger of war and the effects on the citizens of the invaded country, it is raw in its depiction of what happens to non-combatant journalists who are embedded to document the truth, and it is embarrassing how little the outside world knew of this brief but devastating war between Russia and Georgia in 2008 a war concomitant with the Olympic Games in Beijing, China so hungrily observed by the media.  It tests our priorities of information intake and in doing so puts a quite different perspective on world events.  The story is based on true facts and is well paced by writers Mikko Alanne and David Battle and directed with unrelenting intensity by Renny Harlin.The film opens with three journalists and photographers - Thomas Anders (Rupert Friend), Sebastian Ganz (Richard Coyle), and Miriam (Heather Graham) - riding in a jeep in apparently placid countryside when they are struck by a bomb killing Miriam and leaving both Thomas and Sebastian injured.  It soon becomes obvious that Georgia is being attacked by the Russians who (we are told) fear that Georgia is becoming too attached to the West!  Flashes back and forth between comment from the reluctant President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia (Andy Garcia) who demands a cease fire and clips of Putin and his representative Col. Alexandr Demidov (Rade Serbedzija) who increase the bombing bring the tension to the breaking point.  Innocent people are killed, the journalists find refuge in a Georgian wedding where Thomas and Sebastian meet Tatia (Emmanuelle Chriqui) who then joins them in carrying out their mission: the journalists have captured on film footage of the Russians slaughtering civilians and are determined to get the memory card of that incident of truth to authorities who will stop the Russian attack.  How the action proceeds during the brief 5 days is riveting to watch and enlightening to know.Along the way there are others who support the journalists insistence on securing the truth memory card, fine cameo roles for Johnathan Schech, Val Kilmer, Dean Cain, Ken Cranham, Antje Traue and a host of Georgian actors.  For some this may seem like just another war film, but for others it will turn on a light to an all but forgotten (if even known) incident of brutality that should alert everyone to the possibilities of similar events that are in progress around the globe.

Bradley,"[3, 6]","Another political/war movie from the late summer of '11, that was in limited release, but went straight to video where they probably always intended it, is ""5 Days of War"". It's about the Russian invasion that happened in '08. You remember that, right? The Russians invaded the small country of Georgia because they were supposedly bothering the small area of people inside that country called South Ossetia? At the time the Presidential campaign was going on and McCain said he wanted to go to war there? Yeah, right. Well that kind of international disinterest is just what the reporters in this story have to deal with as they're running from the invading army of Causac mercenaries while trying to get the atrocities they videoed out to the rest of a world, more interested in American Idol and the Olympics. The movie isn't really as interesting a story about modern journalism and war as it could be, but for what was basically a limited release intended mostly for video, they really didn't skimp on the location work and the military hardware on display - and the pyrotechnics. Lot's of stuff blows up in this. This movie really kinda' plays like a video game - in fact it surprises me nobody has tried to make it into one. The reporters are running from the army, trying to get incriminating footage, trying to get refugees to safety and trying to get the footage they've recorded on a video card somewhere where it can be uploaded for broadcast. It almost makes you look around your living room for the game controller. The action's too spectacular to take the movie as a serious rendition of what happened and a few of the characters and situations seem a little stock - two of the Causac ""villains"" seem like they should be in a James Bond movie. Still though, I like it sometimes when movies ""encapsulate"" events like this into a form that seems to have lots of ""bits"" that one can leap off into the actual, real aspects of it - if one wants to then go and read up more on the subject. I guess they felt they had to up the action aspect of it to still get people interested in this subject. It's an interesting movie that'll have to do until somebody else can make a more relevant rendition of this event.",3,"History made into action, action, ACTION!",1326067200,"01 9, 2012",2012,2218,"['political/war', 'movie', 'late', 'summer', ""'11"", 'was', 'limited', 'release', 'went', 'straight', 'video', 'where', 'probably', 'always', 'intended', '5', 'Days', 'War', 'Russian', 'invasion', 'happened', ""'08"", 'remember', 'right', 'Russians', 'invaded', 'small', 'country', 'Georgia', 'were', 'supposedly', 'bothering', 'small', 'area', 'people', 'country', 'called', 'South', 'Ossetia', 'time', 'Presidential', 'campaign', 'was', 'going', 'McCain', 'said', 'wanted', 'go', 'war', 'there', 'Yeah', 'right', 'Well', 'kind', 'international', 'disinterest', 'just', 'what', 'reporters', 'story', 'have', 'deal', ""'re"", 'running', 'invading', 'army', 'Causac', 'mercenaries', 'trying', 'get', 'atrocities', 'videoed', 'rest', 'world', 'more', 'interested', 'American', 'Idol', 'Olympics', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'interesting', 'story', 'modern', 'journalism', 'war', 'could', 'be', 'what', 'was', 'basically', 'limited', 'release', 'intended', 'mostly', 'video', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'skimp', 'location', 'work', 'military', 'hardware', 'display', 'pyrotechnics', 'Lot', 'stuff', 'up', 'movie', 'really', 'kinda', 'plays', 'video', 'game', 'fact', 'nobody', 'tried', 'make', 'one', 'reporters', 'are', 'running', 'army', 'trying', 'get', 'incriminating', 'footage', 'trying', 'get', 'refugees', 'safety', 'trying', 'get', 'footage', ""'ve"", 'recorded', 'video', 'card', 'somewhere', 'where', 'can', 'be', 'uploaded', 'broadcast', 'almost', 'look', 'living', 'room', 'game', 'controller', 'action', 'too', 'spectacular', 'take', 'movie', 'serious', 'rendition', 'what', 'happened', 'few', 'characters', 'situations', 'seem', 'little', 'stock', 'two', 'Causac', 'villains', 'seem', 'should', 'be', 'James', 'Bond', 'movie', 'Still', 'like', 'sometimes', 'when', 'movies', 'encapsulate', 'events', 'form', 'have', 'lots', 'bits', 'one', 'can', 'leap', 'off', 'actual', 'real', 'aspects', 'one', 'then', 'go', 'read', 'up', 'more', 'subject', 'guess', 'felt', 'had', 'action', 'aspect', 'still', 'get', 'people', 'interested', 'subject', 'interesting', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'have', 'do', 'somebody', 'else', 'can', 'make', 'more', 'relevant', 'rendition', 'event']",N/A

Anyone that looks into something before they type would know this  is not correct but it was still a good film. To me, what was more important was the showing of how civilians get caught up in the middle of wars started by governments and end up paying the price for something that they had no part in. Most everyone alive wants to go about their daily routine of living without having bombs dropped on their heads or mercenaries machine gunning them while hiding in basements. People don't want to be driven from their homes. People don't want their lives thrown into such chaos. It also shows the crimes against humanity that still take place today and have for thousands of years past. A good example, for me, is the 9-11 attacks on our country. It literally brought this country to a stand still for a week and ruined countless lives of not just the dead but their families. Now, imagine our military budget being cut to ribbons, over half of the fighting force of this country completely gone and one of the other ""super power"" countries deciding this is the perfect time to attack America. Would you want that to be us for even one minute? We all forget just how good we have it in this country. We go to work, we take vacations without having to show ""our papers"" to border guards to go from state to state, we don't live in fear that someone will kick down the front door and haul us off because we don't agree with the current government. No one is flying over your town to bomb it night and day, our streets aren't filled with armed soldiers. Unfortunately, the way things are headed, that could become a reality for us some day in the not too distant future. Movies like this remind me just how precious life is and how we, as Americans, still need to fight as hard as we can to keep it that way. I feel so very sorry for all the countries that have to deal with that on a daily basis but I don't want to be them. So, no, the film is not historically accurate.

Also, there have been a number of movies about war correspondents, but this one really seems to get what happens to them when covering a war that few heard about at the time because of other world events.  It's beautifully filmed and has some great actors apparently doing something they believed in because it comes out in the film.  It's not a documentary, it has a plot and it's a good one and I guarantee you'll stay riveted until the end.

This is an emotional and sometimes tense movie about reporters in Georgia during the war with Russia. Thomas Anders (Friend) is an American journalist sent to document the growing tension between the two countries. When war breaks out it is up to him to report and get the truth out. This is a movie that is pretty moving and tense, but also very slow. A mix between battle scenes and the reporters dodging bullets trying to stay alive long enough to get the story out to the rest of the world. If you like movies like the ""Bang-Bang Club"" this will very much appeal to you. I did enjoy this movie, but it seemed like it was just not quite as good as it could have been. The cast was great and it was a very good movie, but it had the possibility of being better. I'm not sure what it needed though. Overall, a good movie that could have been better.
