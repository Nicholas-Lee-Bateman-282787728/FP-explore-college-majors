688976,A2WKH5YAMNSSQP,B00005Y6XK,"""cgsdesigns1""","[14, 15]","WOWSERS!!!! We are talking beyond WOW here!This is a MUST watch!!!!...I have always been a scifi fan loving movies that can hold you on the edge of your seat with things from out of this world. But lately, it seems Hollywood thinks that it takes sex, nudity, and profanity to hold people to their seats. So I had given up on my favorite genre of movies..... that is until now!Decieved uses more than just special effects to hold you. The characters have depth and carry you through the movie from beginning to end. They have made the good vs. evil movie into one with characters that you can love and some that I know I was moved to extremely dislike. They hold you right until the end with this one!Cloud Ten Pictures and Andre van Heerden did their best job yet with this film and I really look forward to seeing more things like this come from this great Canadian film company...While they really drew my attention with their movie Revelation...this one just broke through all the boundaries and brought forth a movie that has quickly become my favorite movie! I've bought the video and have watched it over and over and still will watch it again! And I will be buying copies to give to friends and relatives because it is such a powerful film that watching it just once isn't enough!I do hope that Hollywood stands up and takes notice. You can have a good movie without the sex and language that keep so many movies out of the homes because the kids can't watch them. Some of us adults are tired of Hollywood thinking that we are too stupid to look beyond the sex and 'hip' language to find a film that actually has some great value to it and a real story also. And how great it was to see ""Smitty"" a Christian woman not made to appear stupid, foolish, or a prude. Judd Nelson, a self confessed computer geek, made me proud to be one myself! And Lou Gossett Jr gave the performance of his career in my opinion.Hollywood take notice!If you are looking for a good thriller with romance, comedy, and strong characters and a good story line, that you are not afraid of who might enter the room while you are watching it, then I strongly recommend that you rent or buy Decieved today! You won't be disappointed and you may walk away with a new appreciation for a solid story line and a few good basic principles in life!",5,WOWSERS!!!,1019779200,"04 26, 2002",2002,2319,"['WOWSERS', 'are', 'talking', 'WOW', 'here', 'MUST', 'watch', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'scifi', 'fan', 'loving', 'movies', 'can', 'hold', 'edge', 'seat', 'things', 'world', 'lately', 'Hollywood', 'sex', 'nudity', 'profanity', 'hold', 'people', 'seats', 'So', 'had', 'given', 'up', 'favorite', 'genre', 'movies', '..', 'now', 'Decieved', 'more', 'just', 'special', 'effects', 'hold', 'characters', 'have', 'depth', 'carry', 'movie', 'beginning', 'end', 'have', 'made', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'movie', 'one', 'characters', 'can', 'love', 'know', 'was', 'moved', 'extremely', 'dislike', 'hold', 'right', 'end', 'one', 'Cloud', 'Ten', 'Pictures', 'Andre', 'van', 'Heerden', 'did', 'best', 'job', 'yet', 'film', 'really', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'more', 'things', 'come', 'great', 'Canadian', 'film', 'company', 'really', 'drew', 'attention', 'movie', 'Revelation', 'one', 'just', 'broke', 'boundaries', 'brought', 'forth', 'movie', 'quickly', 'become', 'favorite', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'video', 'have', 'watched', 'still', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'will', 'be', 'buying', 'copies', 'give', 'friends', 'relatives', 'such', 'powerful', 'film', 'watching', 'just', 'once', ""n't"", 'enough', 'do', 'hope', 'Hollywood', 'up', 'notice', 'can', 'have', 'good', 'movie', 'sex', 'language', 'keep', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'homes', 'kids', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'adults', 'are', 'tired', 'Hollywood', 'thinking', 'are', 'too', 'stupid', 'look', 'sex', ""'hip"", 'language', 'find', 'film', 'actually', 'great', 'value', 'real', 'story', 'also', 'how', 'great', 'was', 'see', 'Smitty', 'Christian', 'woman', 'not', 'made', 'appear', 'stupid', 'foolish', 'prude', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'self', 'confessed', 'computer', 'geek', 'made', 'proud', 'be', 'one', 'Lou', 'Gossett', 'Jr', 'gave', 'performance', 'career', 'opinion.Hollywood', 'take', 'notice', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'thriller', 'romance', 'comedy', 'strong', 'characters', 'good', 'story', 'line', 'are', 'not', 'afraid', 'who', 'might', 'enter', 'room', 'are', 'watching', 'then', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'rent', 'buy', 'Decieved', 'today', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'may', 'walk', 'away', 'new', 'appreciation', 'solid', 'story', 'line', 'few', 'good', 'basic', 'principles', 'life']",Deceived
