I didn't know that this would be a movie-movie; I thought this would be a real season that never was aired.  Still, I decided to watch it... I almost took myself out of my misery because it was so bad.This is terrible.  Garbage.  Junk.  Trash.  The worst thing I have EVER seen in my life.  (Yes folks, it's even worse than ""Pearl Harbor.""  Compared to this movie, ""Pearl Harbor"" should've won Best Picture at the Academy Awards!)It's ""The Real World"" except with a script.... and it's trying to be a ""Scream"" copycat.  The stuff that happens is just embarrassing.  You just want to break down and cry it's so terrible.  The writing, acting, and everything else is just so horrible.  The only ""horror"" you will encounter in this film is that a film so bad was even made in the first place.  (Get Doc Brown!  We need to go back and make sure that this never gets made!  We must go back.... TO THE FUTURE!!!  Oh yeah.... guess we need to go to the past first, THEN back to the future.  Sorry.)And now.... they're releasing it on DVD???  Great.  More terrible garbage being released on DVDs while other great movies still have yet to do so.  I don't get it.It's bad.  Really bad.  Trust me.  You'll regret it if you give this poor excuse of a - I don't even know what to call it - a chance.",1,TURN IT OFF!!!  IT BURNS!!  IT BURNS!!!!

726094,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,B00007AJFI,Richard Ross,"[1, 1]","This movie sucks. Do not waste your time or money on it. Like every other reviewer, I'm a huge fan of 'The Real World' so I was curious to see the first ever 'Real World Movie' (not counting 'The Real Cancun' which, incidentally, is a hell of a lot more entertaining than this). Why creators Mary Ellis-Bunim and Jonathan Murray, both of whom come from a news background, in addition to several 'Real World' alums would agree to spoof themselves in something this dumb and humorless is beyond me. Are all of them really that desperate to get on TV?The 'Lost Season' tells the story of the Vancouver season - the only season in 'Real World' history to be shut down and shelved  halfway through production. Things start off normal enough as 7 strangers arrive at a trendy loft in downtown Vancouver, meet their new roommates and make fast work out of pissing each other off. None of these characters are remotely likable but that's the point. Each one is playing a stereotype of various 'Real World' characters. These include the obnoxious frat guy, the closeted gay one, the small town girl who's a virgin, the stoner who fancies himself a philosopher, the sexy mega bitch and, more to the point, the geeky Asian kid and the angry black girl. If that sounds offensive, blame the filmmakers who clearly don't grasp the meaning of the word satire. Anyway, after spending 20 days in the house the roommates learn that they will be competing in a series of challenges against several ex- Real Worlders for a chance at $50,000. But everything goes to hell when the roommates are kidnapped on the way to the challenge. Taken to an underground bunker, afraid and disoriented, they nervously await the arrival of their captor. He turns out to be a goofy dude named Roland. Roland has been rejected from the 'Real World' so many times he's snapped. He took his dead father's fortune and spent it on creating his own version of the show. The bunker is fully furnished with bedrooms, a kitchen, a bathroom, a hot tub, a huge living room, a confessional and hundreds of hidden cameras. Things aren't all fun and games though since Roland has his own series of challenges planned for his new house-guests. But unlike the MTV version rather than sending contestants home, Roland just kills them whenever they piss him off. He further terrifies them by continually threatening to blow them and the bunker up if they refuse to play along with him. If all this sounds ludicrous that's because it is. Will the 7 roommates outwit this twit and escape? Will the actual Real Worlders, who are holed up in a cabin on the other side of town, come up with new ways to thoroughly embarass themselves while re-enacting their favorite moments from past seasons? Believe me when I say you don't need to know the answers to any of these questions even though they're painfully obvious.The only fun thing in this movie is Roland's performance. I didn't bother to remember the actor's name because I'm pretty sure once a casting agent spots this on his resume he's not going to be moving on to bigger or better roles. He reminded me of Cillian Murphy (don't be offended Scarecrow) and, much like Murphy, he plays the hell out of the role. This is sad for a couple of reasons. First, he obviously took the part seriously and second, no one bothered to remind him it was just an MTV movie. Regardless his acting is so over-the-top and campy that you can't help but smile and enjoy yourself just a little. If the premise interests you, I'd recommend you check out 'Cruel World' another movie about a reality show reject who stages his own version of the show. It stars Edward Furlong in the Roland role and also features Laura Ramsay (who made her film debut in 'The Real Cancun'), Daniel Franzese, Jaime Pressly and Andrew Keegan. I'm not claiming the film is a masterpiece, it's lesser-known and much gorier but it's just as over-the-top. Better yet it actually has the very things this film is lacking: smarts and a sense of humor.",2,"It's Billed As ""Fun"" And ""Real"", But It's Not Real Fun",1287187200,"10 16, 2010",2010,3999,"['movie', 'Do', 'not', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'other', 'reviewer', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Real', 'World', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'first', 'ever', ""'Real"", 'World', 'Movie', 'not', 'counting', 'Real', 'Cancun', 'incidentally', 'hell', 'lot', 'more', 'entertaining', 'Why', 'creators', 'Mary', 'Ellis-Bunim', 'Jonathan', 'Murray', 'whom', 'come', 'news', 'background', 'addition', 'several', ""'Real"", 'World', 'alums', 'would', 'agree', 'spoof', 'something', 'dumb', 'humorless', 'Are', 'really', 'desperate', 'get', 'TV', ""'Lost"", 'Season', 'tells', 'story', 'Vancouver', 'season', 'only', 'season', ""'Real"", 'World', 'history', 'be', 'shut', 'down', 'shelved', 'halfway', 'production', 'Things', 'start', 'normal', 'enough', '7', 'strangers', 'arrive', 'trendy', 'loft', 'downtown', 'Vancouver', 'meet', 'new', 'roommates', 'make', 'fast', 'work', 'pissing', 'other', 'off', 'None', 'characters', 'are', 'remotely', 'likable', 'point', 'one', 'playing', 'stereotype', 'various', ""'Real"", 'World', 'characters', 'include', 'obnoxious', 'frat', 'guy', 'closeted', 'gay', 'one', 'small', 'town', 'girl', 'who', 'virgin', 'stoner', 'who', 'philosopher', 'sexy', 'mega', 'bitch', 'more', 'point', 'geeky', 'Asian', 'kid', 'angry', 'black', 'girl', 'offensive', 'blame', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'clearly', 'do', ""n't"", 'grasp', 'meaning', 'word', 'satire', 'Anyway', 'spending', '20', 'days', 'house', 'roommates', 'learn', 'will', 'be', 'competing', 'series', 'challenges', 'several', 'ex-', 'Real', 'Worlders', 'chance', '50,000', 'everything', 'hell', 'when', 'roommates', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'way', 'challenge', 'Taken', 'underground', 'bunker', 'afraid', 'disoriented', 'nervously', 'await', 'arrival', 'captor', 'out', 'be', 'goofy', 'dude', 'named', 'Roland', 'Roland', 'been', 'rejected', ""'Real"", 'World', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'snapped', 'took', 'dead', 'father', 'fortune', 'spent', 'creating', 'own', 'version', 'show', 'bunker', 'fully', 'furnished', 'bedrooms', 'kitchen', 'bathroom', 'hot', 'tub', 'huge', 'living', 'room', 'confessional', 'hundreds', 'hidden', 'cameras', 'Things', 'are', ""n't"", 'fun', 'games', 'Roland', 'own', 'series', 'challenges', 'planned', 'new', 'house-guests', 'MTV', 'version', 'rather', 'sending', 'contestants', 'home', 'Roland', 'just', 'whenever', 'piss', 'off', 'further', 'terrifies', 'continually', 'threatening', 'blow', 'bunker', 'up', 'refuse', 'play', 'along', 'ludicrous', 'Will', '7', 'roommates', 'outwit', 'twit', 'escape', 'Will', 'actual', 'Real', 'Worlders', 'who', 'are', 'holed', 'up', 'cabin', 'other', 'side', 'town', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'ways', 'thoroughly', 'embarass', 're-enacting', 'favorite', 'moments', 'past', 'seasons', 'Believe', 'when', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'know', 'answers', 'questions', 'even', ""'re"", 'painfully', 'obvious.The', 'only', 'fun', 'thing', 'movie', 'Roland', 'performance', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'remember', 'actor', 'name', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'casting', 'agent', 'spots', 'resume', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'moving', 'bigger', 'better', 'roles', 'reminded', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'offended', 'Scarecrow', 'much', 'Murphy', 'hell', 'role', 'sad', 'couple', 'reasons', 'First', 'obviously', 'took', 'part', 'seriously', 'second', 'one', 'bothered', 'remind', 'was', 'just', 'MTV', 'movie', 'Regardless', 'acting', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'smile', 'enjoy', 'just', 'little', 'premise', 'interests', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'check', 'out', ""'Cruel"", 'World', 'movie', 'reality', 'show', 'reject', 'who', 'own', 'version', 'show', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'Roland', 'role', 'also', 'Laura', 'Ramsay', 'who', 'made', 'film', 'debut', ""'The"", 'Real', 'Cancun', 'Daniel', 'Franzese', 'Jaime', 'Pressly', 'Andrew', 'Keegan', ""'m"", 'not', 'claiming', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'lesser-known', 'much', 'gorier', 'just', 'over-the-top', 'Better', 'yet', 'actually', 'very', 'things', 'film', 'lacking', 'smarts', 'sense', 'humor']",N/A
