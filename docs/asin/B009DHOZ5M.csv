1595404,A1EGRI1JQEQNKA,B009DHOZ5M,Amazon Customer,"[17, 17]","This has been my favorite rock musical since the original album was released when I was a pre-teen. I have followed most every available version since, and so picking up the blu-ray of this production was pretty nearly obligatory.Overall I enjoyed this production, I was a little concerned early on that they were going to take huge liberties with the material because the first couple minutes were pretty heavily saturated with occupy wall st-esque graphics, but things settle down after that and they perform the show in a manner respectful of the original, with some inventive staging.The cast was a bit of a mixed bag for me. I really enjoyed Tim Minchin (Judas), Melanie (Mary Magdalene) and the supporting cast playing Pilate, Herod, Caiaphas, Annas, etc. Where I ran into a bit of difficulty was Ben Forster's portrayal of Jesus, which just didn't connect with me personally. I know many people find him a fantastic performer, but for me he was just a little subdued and lacking the charisma to offset Minchin's Judas when they were on stage together. Let's face it, Judas gets the best lyrics, the Jesus role really needs to be carried on emotion and sincerity. For me Mr Forster just didn't bring it off. Your mileage may vary.Immediately after finishing viewing, I got the urge to toss the 2001 DVD version in the player. While the new arena show has much to recommend it, honestly, I feel this was a superior version overall, in almost every area except of course video/audio quality.In the end though, despite a reservation or two, I think this is worthy of viewing/purchase.",4,"A fine looking, well produced version, but...",1378944000,"09 12, 2013",2013,1587,"['been', 'favorite', 'rock', 'musical', 'original', 'album', 'was', 'released', 'when', 'was', 'pre-teen', 'have', 'followed', 'most', 'available', 'version', 'so', 'picking', 'up', 'blu-ray', 'production', 'was', 'pretty', 'nearly', 'obligatory.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'production', 'was', 'little', 'concerned', 'early', 'were', 'going', 'take', 'huge', 'liberties', 'material', 'first', 'couple', 'minutes', 'were', 'pretty', 'heavily', 'saturated', 'occupy', 'wall', 'st-esque', 'graphics', 'things', 'settle', 'down', 'perform', 'show', 'manner', 'respectful', 'original', 'inventive', 'staging.The', 'cast', 'was', 'bit', 'mixed', 'bag', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Tim', 'Minchin', 'Judas', 'Melanie', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'supporting', 'cast', 'playing', 'Pilate', 'Herod', 'Caiaphas', 'Annas', 'etc', 'Where', 'ran', 'bit', 'difficulty', 'was', 'Ben', 'Forster', 'portrayal', 'Jesus', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'connect', 'personally', 'know', 'many', 'people', 'find', 'fantastic', 'performer', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'subdued', 'lacking', 'charisma', 'offset', 'Minchin', 'Judas', 'when', 'were', 'stage', 'together', 'Let', 'face', 'Judas', 'best', 'lyrics', 'Jesus', 'role', 'really', 'be', 'carried', 'emotion', 'sincerity', 'Mr', 'Forster', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'bring', 'off', 'mileage', 'may', 'vary.Immediately', 'finishing', 'viewing', 'got', 'urge', 'toss', '2001', 'DVD', 'version', 'player', 'new', 'arena', 'show', 'much', 'recommend', 'honestly', 'feel', 'was', 'superior', 'version', 'overall', 'almost', 'area', 'course', 'video/audio', 'end', 'reservation', 'two', 'think', 'worthy', 'viewing/purchase']",Jesus Christ Superstar: Live Arena Tour 2012

1595407,A1KVB4N4G2TD9Q,B009DHOZ5M,"Carrie Lynn Frost ""Blood N Roses""","[0, 0]","My title for my review is a nod to the fact that noted Spice Girl, Melanie C, was given the plum role of the female lead, Mary Magdalene (in Scripture, Christ's closest female disciple who witnessed the Crucifixion and was the first to see and speak to Him after the Resurrection).  I might add, she acquits herself quite well, dreds and tattoos and all, as do the rest of the cast.This is an ultra-modern inerpretation of the Biblical story, with up-to date references and technolgy.  Jesus and his followers are portrayed as gnarly-looking young protest-everything types, while the Sanhedrin (the court of Jewish priests that ultimately captured Jesus, turned Him in to Rome, and had Him crucified by the Romans) are suit-and-tie types.  Herod is portrayed as the host of a cheezy talk show who, after his musical number, invites his viewers to text their vote as to whether or not Jesus is the Son of God.  The scene in which Jesus drives out the &#34;moneychangers&#34; has the feeling of decadence and corruption, with scantily clad male and female dancers, the kind of thing that would have driven Him to that level of anger.  During the flogging/Crucifixion scenes, Jesus wears not a loincloth but a modern orange prison jumpsuit.For all this, the story remains reverent to the original source material, if it does not explicitly depict the Resurrection, thereby stating definitively that Jesus was/is Son of God.  The actor/singer playing Jesus is particularly effective in his &#34;Gethsemane&#34; number and as he hangs on the Cross for his final moments.  Tim Minchin, the actor playing Judas, is also worth an honorable mention, especially for his performance leading up to the moment his character hangs himself (which is very powerfully portrayed).All in all, if you are open to a fresh but still respectful depiction of the Biblical story of Jesus the Christ, and you appreciate the musical rock-opera score, this is worth adding to your collection.  A nice alternative to the usual Bibical epics that one commonly finds during the Passover/Lent/Easter seasons.Enjoy.

1595411,A3QSM5XHPL1T6Y,B009DHOZ5M,"Greg ""Saganite""","[4, 5]","This staging of Jesus Christ Superstar is so fresh and powerful, it hardly seems like the same musical asJesus Christ Superstar (1973), the venerable and well-intentioned hippy version. Live Arena JCS is for our times, set in our time, with real-world concerns and references (texting, reality TV, One Direction, corruption among the power elite, surveillance, etc.). But it's the music that really ups this JCS's game, from a harder-edged, less strings-driven instrumentation to vocals that run a gamut from wispy and crooning to primal scream and rabid growl.I ordered this DVD right away because I'm a big Tim Minchin fan, having seen him in concert in Minneapolis a couple of years ago and at his performance at last year's Reason Rally in Washington, D.C., and Minchin has the key role of Judas. Minchin does a terrific job with that role and gives dramatic voice to the character's ambivalence about who Jesus is and how to respond to the unfolding story.Two slightly false notes in an otherwise sterling experience: I didn't care for the staging of King Herod's song (but to be honest, the campy, comedic song has always seemed a little intrusive given the dire events that surround it--still I've seen it done better in other stagings); and the ""Superstar"" production near the end, with Judas posing that all-important question, ""Are you who they say you are?"" to the crucified Jesus, was so glitzy and glittery with twerking angels (well--almost twerking) that the seriousness of the song's intent is easily lost.But maybe that's OK. The effect of JCS is to humanize Jesus, and to reclaim what amounts to a kind of folk hero from theologians who seem more intent on creating finely crafted, almost algebraic, dogmas and doctrines ABOUT Jesus, than to let his story wash over them with all its power and drama. I am proudly and happily an atheist. But I have never been immune to the appeal of a person who tries to stand against the oppressors of his or her time, to identify with vulnerable people, to love and lose and feel betrayal and denial, and to courageously face an uncertain destiny with defiance and courage. Stripped of some frankly irrational and unappealing theological elements, the Jesus story presented in Jesus Christ Superstar--and especially, THIS Jesus Christ Superstar--is one for the ages.",5,Blown away.

1595417,ATQVHD4OMWKPV,B009DHOZ5M,Neil Turner,"[1, 1]","I saw Jesus Christ Superstar when it first came to Broadway in the early 1970's and was bowled over by both the production and the music. I greatly anticipated the movie (1973) but was somewhat disappointed. At that time, I did not like the addition of the modern elements to the film, but I have mellowed my aversion with age and wisdom.The music is the thing in Superstar, one really doesn't need visuals, but they do add to the pleasure of the rock opera. On Broadway, the visuals relied upon costumes and innovative stage operations which featured a three-piece stage that rose and fell to accentuate the action. In the film, the authentic locations played the key role in the setting along with some inventive physical constructions. In Jesus Christ Superstar - Live Arena Tour the whole of the action takes place on a huge staircase with an enormous video screen in the background. As described by the set designer in the DVD extras, he chose this setting because it represents what the powerful in society have always done to express their power - build huge staircases in order to elevate themselves from the normal man.My opinions of the setting and costumes, for me, express my maturity of thought from the time I was a man in his mid-twenties to today, a man in his late sixties for the whole production is staged in modern times against the background of political and financial unrest in Great Britain. This period is perfectly expressed in the lyrics and emotions of the score even though it is separated by more than two-thousand years from the actual events. Man is still not learning a thing from history.Of course, for Superstar, the performance is the thing, and this arena version has extraordinary interpretations of Jesus and Judas by Ben Forster and Tim Minchin - especially Minchin. The power of their performances put this video over the top for me. The only performance I found to be lacking as opposed to the play and the movie was that of Alexander Hanson as Pontius Pilate. Hanson is an accomplished actor and certainly played the part very well, but his ""singing"" was more of spoken word accompanied by music. I remember reading somewhere that the original Broadway Pilate - played by Barry Dennen was given the additional song, ""Pilate's Dream"" that was supposed to be sung by Pilate's wife because of his impressive voice. Dennen makes the song a highlight of the play. He also reprised the part in the film.

However Jesus knew who he was and what his purpose was and there surely was an assurance and confidence in the man.

They were all dressed in modern attire, I'm thinking I really have to sit down and watch this.The first thing is the score, the beloved masterpiece score was cradled with affection for the true genius that it is, and performed with much gusto by the singers, dancers, and actors. There was no liberal let down, I was truly impressed. The matter of dress can be dealt with when you figure that parallels are being delivered to modern society and what it would look like if the ancient corporate honchos of yesterday would look like today, as well as the peasants and followers of Christ.

1595423,A2Z6927GQ3A6KP,B009DHOZ5M,"R. Pearrow ""Rick""","[3, 6]","If someone was to ask me what my favorite music of all time is, I would never hesitate to say the music of Jesus Christ Superstar.  Since the first time I heard the brilliant score of Andrew Lloyd Webber and the equally brilliant lyrics of Tim Rice, this rock opera has remained at the top of my list of inspirational music and has always seemed to be there when times were bad for me. I loved the original Broadway recording, the Norman Jewison film, have starred as Jesus in a private production myself, and went to see the the live theatrical shows featuring Ted Neely as Christ at least five times. I wanted to be as openly minded about this new version as I could and gave it my undivided attention throughout the playing of the DVD without voicing too many opinions until I could form what I would consider a fair representation of my feelings of this rendition.I'm not a big fan of remakes or reboots of movies or shows, and most of the time I feel that an artists work should reflect the times of its inception, and was not too impressed with the settings of this show.  I can appreciate the cell phones, tablets, three piece suits and other modern trinkets which reflect the modern way of life, but when you depend on the characters to pull the show, this is where I found this performance to fall very short.  Having played Jesus myself (and I never would put myself on a par with some of the brilliant performers who have played this part), I was hoping for a sterling performance out of Ben Forster's Christ.  I was greatly disappointed. His portrayal was more of a spoiled kid rather than the Prince of Peace.  At times his high notes were more of screaming than effective singing, and he severely lacked the caring and empathetic nature that would normally speak for Jesus. I found his character cold and his performance close to that of a high school kid who was trying for the part, but not successful. His climactic scene on the cross was almost laughable complete with... red confetti?. Tim Minchin as Judas started off extremely effective and I was looking forward to each of his numbers, however it seemed his rendition of the traitorous apostle continually spiraled downward until his ultimate demise (surprisingly well produced visually).  Melanie Chisholm's Mary Magdalane was spot on note wise, however again I failed to feel the empathy I was hoping to achieve from a character who was confused in her feelings for Christ, and wanted nothing more than to understand what this man was all about.  It seemed she just sang her songs, and that was about it.  When it came time for emotion, it just wasn't there.What annoyed me the most were the smaller character parts going over the top to try and gain their few minutes of fame on the stage.  The worst was Gerard Bentall who played Annas.  It seemed every line he sang was way overly done in his hopes that his statement would be, &#34;hey, look at me!.&#34;  Pete Gallager's failure at the low-singing Caiaphas was also a disappointment, where I have seen much stronger performers not only handling the low notes much more effectively, but also convey the power of the high priest. Gallager simply toddled across the stage shifting is octaves from low to high to attempt to pull the part out of the ashes.  Alexander Hanson's Pilate could have been played by anyone.  Appearing as a tennis bum fresh off the court, his talking of several lines left the part of the Procurator with much to be desired.  This was topped off by his poor efforts during the trial.  It seemed he just wanted to get through it and get back on the court.  Herod's number, attempting to be more of a TV show, was a farce.  Texting, while a major part of today's society did not belong in this performance.The full company, when they sang in group numbers were fantastic.  Great harmony, incredible voices, and a very smooth rendition of the songs with &#34;Hosanna&#34; being the highlight of the entire show.  The live orchestration was also a great tribute to the musical score.  So often the musicians are taken for granted, and in this case, if so, they accomplished their job extremely well. I didn't care for the appearance of the guitar player before &#34;Damned for all Time,&#34; but I believe I understood the metaphor behind it.As time marches on I guess the creators of this show figure that this work of art must change along with it.  I'm not sure why they feel this way, but as versions go, this was not the &#34;greatest one ever&#34; as many of the reviewers here may state.  It was hard to &#34;feel&#34; any emotion during this performance, and hard to mourn for a Christ who looks more like Charles Manson and fails to carry the part to where it should be.  For you die hard fans of this score as I am, give it a fair shot, but rent or download it.  I don't believe this will be one you will be viewing over and over again as I did Ted Neely's movie, or the money I spent on seeing his stage performances the many times I did.",3,Performances fall
