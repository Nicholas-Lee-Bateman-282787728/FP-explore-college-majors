686027,A2NTJUI2DLZF4R,B00005UV69,"Craig Chalquist, PhD, author of TERRAPSYCHOLO...","[40, 41]","This DVD takes you all the way from pulling drums out of the box to putting them together to holding the sticks to playing simple beats and grooves. The instruction is clear and includes some of Tommy Igoe's students, ending with some playing of his own. Perfect for the beginner with little or no drumming experience. Highly recommended.BTW, a few extra tips for beginners:1. Resist the urge to buy tons of drums and cymbals. You'll quickly feel overwhelmed. Start simple and add pieces as you get better.2. Learn everything with both matched and traditional grips on the sticks.3. Find a drumming instructor who is interested (my first one seemed bored), encouraging, and challenging (makes you count out loud when you don't feel like it, makes you play music you don't like, pushes you when you need it).4. If you have trouble playing something, SLOW DOWN. There's an almost irresistible urge to play too fast when you start. Resist it.5. Face the fact that learning drumming requires a lot of repetition, especially when you start practicing the 40 rudiments. Use this repetitive work as a contemplative practice, a kind of drumming meditation. That's what the shamans did in traditional cultures.6. A long practice session that feels crappy or difficult does more for you than a short one that goes smoothly. Let your brain and body learn in their own time.7. Have fun! As the film says, drumming is not a race, nor is it a competition or something you ""should"" do. Let it be a source of satisfaction. Use it creatively.",5,Start here--,1254441600,"10 2, 2009",2009,1525,"['DVD', 'way', 'pulling', 'drums', 'box', 'putting', 'together', 'holding', 'sticks', 'playing', 'simple', 'beats', 'grooves', 'instruction', 'clear', 'Tommy', 'Igoe', 'students', 'ending', 'playing', 'own', 'Perfect', 'beginner', 'little', 'drumming', 'experience', 'Highly', 'recommended.BTW', 'few', 'extra', 'tips', 'beginners:1', 'Resist', 'urge', 'buy', 'tons', 'drums', 'cymbals', ""'ll"", 'quickly', 'feel', 'overwhelmed', 'Start', 'simple', 'add', 'pieces', 'get', 'better.2', 'Learn', 'everything', 'matched', 'traditional', 'grips', 'sticks.3', 'Find', 'drumming', 'instructor', 'who', 'interested', 'first', 'one', 'seemed', 'bored', 'encouraging', 'challenging', 'count', 'out', 'loud', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'play', 'music', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'pushes', 'when', 'need', '.4', 'have', 'trouble', 'playing', 'something', 'SLOW', 'DOWN', 'almost', 'irresistible', 'urge', 'play', 'too', 'fast', 'when', 'start', 'Resist', 'it.5', 'Face', 'fact', 'learning', 'drumming', 'lot', 'repetition', 'especially', 'when', 'start', 'practicing', '40', 'rudiments', 'Use', 'repetitive', 'work', 'contemplative', 'practice', 'kind', 'drumming', 'meditation', 'what', 'shamans', 'did', 'traditional', 'cultures.6', 'long', 'practice', 'session', 'crappy', 'difficult', 'more', 'short', 'one', 'smoothly', 'Let', 'brain', 'body', 'learn', 'own', 'time.7', 'Have', 'fun', 'film', 'drumming', 'not', 'race', 'competition', 'something', 'should', 'do', 'Let', 'be', 'source', 'satisfaction', 'Use', 'creatively']",N/A

The DVD is well produced so its easy to move around in it's parts.There is pure information about setting up a new drum set and there are sample drum grooves for the beginning drummer to work on. I'm a fan of Tommy's teaching style and his enthusiasm for playing music.Good luck and good music to all,5,Tommy Igoe can get you going,1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,365,"['Tommy', 'good', 'video', 'instructor', 'pace', 'moving', 'fast', 'DVD', 'well', 'produced', 'so', 'easy', 'move', 'around', 'parts.There', 'pure', 'information', 'setting', 'up', 'new', 'drum', 'set', 'are', 'sample', 'drum', 'grooves', 'beginning', 'drummer', 'work', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Tommy', 'teaching', 'style', 'enthusiasm', 'playing', 'music.Good', 'luck', 'good', 'music']",N/A
686029,A3HJ1ZR5TXYJQC,B00005UV69,Michael Holmes,"[26, 29]","Even with 25 years of playing experience, there is something to be learned about drumming.  I wanted to go back over everything I've learned and see if I could find something in theory that supported what I have learned in practice. Although an introductory DVD aimed at beginners, this DVD was a nice refresher that reminded me of some of the things I had forgotten.  It also showed me a thing or two that was new.  It's a great place to start for beginners and Tommy Igoe's professional yet very approachable manner has me anticipating the availability of his new (as of this writing) ""GROOVE ESSENTIALS"" DVD.  I've still got a lot to learn and I feel that Tommy Igoe is just the man I want to sit down and study/jam with. --- The best way to study is to listen and watch and learn.  This DVD accomplishes just that.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the production value is sometimes a little bit off.  By that I don't mean anything that affects your study or the watchability of the DVD, I just mean that, on occasion, you catch one of the cameramen or a camera lens in a shot.  It is difficult to avoid in such a confined working space where you have a need for strange camera angles and a desire for crisp closeups but it just gives a bit of a sense that this DVD was shot and edited on a shoestring budget.  (I hated putting this negative bit on the end.  Please understand that it is indeed really a minor consideration that only pops up in one or two shots throughout the entire DVD and really won't cause you any concern.)  In short, if you are looking for a starting point to drumming and a great teacher to show you the way, pick this up today.",4,Even for Experienced Players,1096588800,"10 1, 2004",2004,1672,"['Even', '25', 'years', 'playing', 'experience', 'something', 'be', 'learned', 'drumming', 'wanted', 'go', 'back', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'see', 'could', 'find', 'something', 'theory', 'supported', 'what', 'have', 'learned', 'practice', 'introductory', 'DVD', 'aimed', 'beginners', 'DVD', 'was', 'nice', 'refresher', 'reminded', 'things', 'had', 'forgotten', 'also', 'showed', 'thing', 'two', 'was', 'new', 'great', 'place', 'start', 'beginners', 'Tommy', 'Igoe', 'professional', 'yet', 'very', 'approachable', 'manner', 'anticipating', 'availability', 'new', 'writing', 'GROOVE', 'ESSENTIALS', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'still', 'got', 'lot', 'learn', 'feel', 'Tommy', 'Igoe', 'just', 'man', 'want', 'sit', 'down', 'study/jam', 'best', 'way', 'study', 'listen', 'watch', 'learn', 'DVD', 'just', 'only', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', '5', 'stars', 'production', 'value', 'sometimes', 'little', 'bit', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'anything', 'study', 'watchability', 'DVD', 'just', 'mean', 'occasion', 'catch', 'one', 'cameramen', 'camera', 'shot', 'difficult', 'avoid', 'such', 'confined', 'working', 'space', 'where', 'have', 'need', 'strange', 'camera', 'angles', 'desire', 'crisp', 'closeups', 'just', 'bit', 'sense', 'DVD', 'was', 'shot', 'edited', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'hated', 'putting', 'negative', 'bit', 'end', 'Please', 'understand', 'indeed', 'really', 'minor', 'consideration', 'only', 'up', 'one', 'two', 'shots', 'entire', 'DVD', 'really', 'wo', ""n't"", 'cause', 'concern', 'short', 'are', 'looking', 'starting', 'point', 'drumming', 'great', 'teacher', 'show', 'way', 'pick', 'up', 'today']",N/A

To an aspiring new drummer this DVD will not only lead you through how to set up the kit in an optimum configuration - it will also take you through the basics of selecting sticks, strike zones on your drums, and how to adjust and use each piece of a standard kit.I like the format, which is divided into Setting Up and Start Playing.  The Setting Up part is full of information and tips.  My husband has been playing for over 40 years and he learned a few things from this section (incredible as that may seem).Start Playing provides a little fun and a lot of encouragement.  After tips on selecting and holding sticks, and a quick overview of drums and pedals, you get three grooves that even a new drummer can quickly master - building confidence - and some excellent instruction on fills and rolls.  A nice feature is the three play-along pieces, which adds even more fun to this DVD.Igoe is a masterful instructor and accomplished drummer. You feel as though he's in the room with you throughout this DVD, and the wealth of knowledge - presented in easy to grasp bits - that he imparts is amazing. I also recommend getting Igoe's ""Groove Essentials"" (ASIN B00064YTKM) for anyone who has progressed into intermediate or better playing.  It will take you to the next step.",5,This should ship with every drum kit,1101772800,"11 30, 2004",2004,1400,"['Depending', 'drum', 'brand', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'receive', 'instructions', 'how', 'set', 'up', 'kit', 'much', 'less', 'how', 'get', 'started', 'aspiring', 'new', 'drummer', 'DVD', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'lead', 'how', 'set', 'up', 'kit', 'optimum', 'configuration', 'will', 'also', 'take', 'basics', 'selecting', 'sticks', 'strike', 'zones', 'drums', 'how', 'adjust', 'use', 'piece', 'standard', 'kit.I', 'format', 'divided', 'Setting', 'Up', 'Start', 'Playing', 'Setting', 'Up', 'part', 'full', 'information', 'tips', 'husband', 'been', 'playing', '40', 'years', 'learned', 'few', 'things', 'section', 'incredible', 'may', 'seem', '.Start', 'Playing', 'little', 'fun', 'lot', 'encouragement', 'tips', 'selecting', 'holding', 'sticks', 'quick', 'overview', 'drums', 'pedals', 'get', 'three', 'grooves', 'even', 'new', 'drummer', 'can', 'quickly', 'master', 'building', 'confidence', 'excellent', 'instruction', 'fills', 'rolls', 'nice', 'feature', 'three', 'play-along', 'pieces', 'even', 'more', 'fun', 'DVD.Igoe', 'masterful', 'instructor', 'accomplished', 'drummer', 'feel', 'room', 'DVD', 'wealth', 'knowledge', 'presented', 'easy', 'grasp', 'bits', 'amazing', 'also', 'recommend', 'getting', 'Igoe', 'Groove', 'Essentials', 'ASIN', 'B00064YTKM', 'anyone', 'who', 'progressed', 'intermediate', 'better', 'playing', 'will', 'take', 'next', 'step']",N/A
