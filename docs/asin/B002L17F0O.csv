It was absolutely fantastic. The cast was well thought out and played their parts almost exactly like the animated characters. There were plenty of action scenes and the occasional cheesy scenes, but all ""live action"" movies have those. The plot was pretty good considering it's just a spin-off of a childrens show but.... The music was great too. The only real complaint I have about this movie is the slightly cheesy effects. Some of them were actually pretty cool like Ben's transformations and stuff but some were just plain bad.
