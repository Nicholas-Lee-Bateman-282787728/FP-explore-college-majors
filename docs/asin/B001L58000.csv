This film lacks the romantic premise of Ghost where the murdered lover returns to simultaneously tie things up with the love of his life and solve his own murder. This film is not some zombie film where the undead return to wreak havoc on the living. No, here we have those who have died with little [or big] things that are bothering them and they seek some resolve.A sarcastic, misanthropic dentist named Bertram Pincus [British funnyman Ricky Gervais] technically died on the operating table for seven minutes and suddenly sees dead people everywhere! And they are talking to him endlessly. This is certainly not an original or funny premise. It feels like we've seen it all before somewhere though I cannot immediately put my finger on it.A ruthless cheater Frank Herlihy [the affable, cute Greg Kinnear] was engaged to Gwen [the even more adorable and talented Tea Leoni]. Now he sees she is engaged to another and he wants that broken off and he thinks that Bertram can make it happen. Frank is determined that Gwen never marries this new guy. Why? I guess even in death he wants her to be miserable. So Frank feeds Bertram material that only Frank and Gwen would know and bing, bang, soon Gwen and Bertram are friends and hitting it off. Gwen seems motivated and open-minded while Pincus is just annoyed at everyone and everything the majority of the time.Ghost Town moves at an excruciatingly slow pace and is as enjoyable as having a cavity filled. It is a shame because Gervais, Leoni and Kinnear should be working with much better material.",2,Worse than getting a cavity filled,1231459200,"01 9, 2009",2009,1702,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'type', 'ghost', 'film', 'possibly', 'could', 'be', 'why', 'Ghost', 'Town', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'venturing', 'uncharted', 'waters', 'film', 'romantic', 'premise', 'Ghost', 'where', 'murdered', 'lover', 'returns', 'simultaneously', 'tie', 'things', 'up', 'love', 'life', 'solve', 'own', 'murder', 'film', 'not', 'zombie', 'film', 'where', 'undead', 'return', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'living', 'No', 'here', 'have', 'who', 'have', 'died', 'little', '[', 'big', ']', 'things', 'are', 'bothering', 'seek', 'resolve.A', 'sarcastic', 'misanthropic', 'dentist', 'named', 'Bertram', 'Pincus', '[', 'British', 'funnyman', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', ']', 'technically', 'died', 'operating', 'table', 'seven', 'minutes', 'suddenly', 'dead', 'people', 'everywhere', 'are', 'talking', 'endlessly', 'certainly', 'not', 'original', 'funny', 'premise', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'somewhere', 'can', 'not', 'immediately', 'put', 'finger', 'it.A', 'ruthless', 'cheater', 'Frank', 'Herlihy', 'affable', 'cute', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', ']', 'was', 'engaged', 'Gwen', '[', 'even', 'more', 'adorable', 'talented', 'Tea', 'Leoni', ']', 'Now', 'engaged', 'broken', 'off', 'Bertram', 'can', 'make', 'happen', 'Frank', 'determined', 'Gwen', 'never', 'new', 'guy', 'Why', 'guess', 'even', 'death', 'be', 'miserable', 'So', 'Frank', 'feeds', 'Bertram', 'material', 'only', 'Frank', 'Gwen', 'would', 'know', 'bing', 'bang', 'soon', 'Gwen', 'Bertram', 'are', 'friends', 'hitting', 'off', 'Gwen', 'motivated', 'open-minded', 'Pincus', 'just', 'annoyed', 'everyone', 'everything', 'majority', 'time.Ghost', 'Town', 'excruciatingly', 'slow', 'pace', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'having', 'cavity', 'filled', 'shame', 'Gervais', 'Leoni', 'Kinnear', 'should', 'be', 'working', 'much', 'better', 'material']",N/A

1213489,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B001L58000,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 2]","GHOST TOWN (2008) is an ideal Halloween season movie, a romantic comedy that in overview is the story of a misanthrope who, as an aftereffect of spectral importuning, reclaims his humanity and finds happiness.Ricky Gervais is wryly marvelous as Dr. Bertram Pincus, a British dentist who emigrated to NYC to follow the woman he loved. She later left him for someone else. Now, he has no tolerance for people and lives in miserable isolation, when not stuffing things in the mouths of patients to stop their incessant chattering.Pincus has an allergic reaction to anesthesia given during a colonoscopy and he dies... for seven minutes. After being revived, he's got the unique ability to see and speak with dozens of ghosts. They follow him everywhere at first, begging Pincus help them find peace by relaying messages to loved ones and acquaintances of theirs. If Pincus has no time for the living, he's even more short-tempered with these spooks.Greg Kinnear is one of them. In life, Frank Herlihy was a man of wealth and a weasel who cheated on his wife, Gwen (T&eacute;a Leoni), an Egyptologist who gives lectures on Dynastic mummies. After being crushed by a falling wall air conditioner, all Frank's spirit wants to do now is keep Gwen from marrying an idealistic lawyer named Richard (Blly Campbell) that (Frank tells Pincus) is trying to steal Gwen's inheritance.By promising to rid him of the other pestering ghosts, Frank gets Pincus to try and prevent Gwen's impending marriage to Richard. Pincus, who isn't very tall, isn't too attractive and certainly isn't charming, thinks he can make Gwen fall in love with him. A bemused Frank tags along and offers advice that Pincus ignores. As improbable as it seems at first, the curmudgeonly dentist does get Gwen to care for him. But will she break her engagement with handsome, suave Richard?A genuinely funny story told through witty dialogue and sight gag, it's done in traditional style (no goshawful shakycam!). With several bellylaugh moments and just enough plot uncertainty, everything comes to a very satisfying conclusion.

1213496,A2582KMXLK2P06,B001L58000,B. E Jackson,"[1, 2]","Ghost Town isn't necessarily a BAD film.  It has its moments.  The storyline itself isn't too great, however.  A guy has a near death experience on the operating table, and upon leaving the hospital he realizes he can see and communicate with walking dead people.  It's a comedy with a little bit of drama thrown in sometimes.The storytelling has its moments of blandness from time to time, which is why I'm not rating the film higher.  Some of the humor is a bit on the unsatisfactory side as well.There will be times where you think the humor should click, but you're not actually laughing.  However, this could very well be an acquired taste thanks to the lead actor being portrayed by Ricky Gervais.  His style of humor is not for everyone.  I don't know if it's a British style, or just HIS personal style, but to me the humor feels like it misses the mark several times throughout Ghost Town.The actor who plays the ghost following Ricky's character around everywhere is another person I don't particularly care for.Anyway, my favorite moments basically come from all the little things, such as a scene where Ricky's character has a dog breathing right next to him and he feels uncomfortable about it, and many times when he communicates with the woman who plays the lead actress, many of these conversations become hilarious because apparently Ricky doesn't know how to properly talk to her.That leads me to mention the storyline.  It's about this one persistent ghost (the one who follows Ricky Gervais around everywhere) who wants Ricky to talk to his ex-wife (who's alive) so she knows her dead husband (ex-husband actually- you'll find out what I mean about this when you watch it) still loves her very much.  Not a particularly interesting or original concept, but let's just move along.Of course, you can fully expect many scenes showing Ricky talking to ghosts that nobody else can see, so it appears like Ricky is talking to himself.  This has been done several times in other movies and cartoons pertaining to the same concept, so you can expect more of the same here.Just an average film to me.

Soon Bertram Pincus D.D.S. (Ricky Gravis) meets with an untimely &#34;end&#34; of sorts and is able to see dead people.  So as tradition has it Frank recruits Bertram to protect Frank's widow from marrying what seems like an unseemly person. Naturally thing go awry. We cannot help from kibitzing.

The acting, by Gervais, T&eacute;a Leoni, and Greg Kinnear is all first-rate. The whole thing was shot in NY and, accordingly, there's a slew of terrific NY stage and screen thesps in it (Dana Ivey, Brian d'Arcy James, Brad Oscar, Julia Murney, Sebastian LaCause), as well as the peerless Kristen Wiig (who has an extended scene with Gervais which is a celebration of these two brilliant actors' comic timing) and the always terrific Alan Ruck. A shout out to Monte Bezell, with whom I used to work, who plays a cab driver.Anyway, as much as the movie seems to meander after the first half-hour there's actually very little dead (ha, ha!) time in the telling of the story. There are also some heartfelt and well-earned emotional moments which made me glad I'd watched it. Odd thing is, I think it might be even better, compressed, as a musical with a younger version of Nathan Lane in the Gervais curmudgeon role.I am a big fan of David Koepp, who co-wrote and directed this.

I had high hopes for ""Ghost Town,"" but it just didn't deliver.It's a bad sign when the movie leads with poop jokes.  I'm not opposed to them, but they are trite and cliche.  It doesn't help that Ricky Gervais and Greg Kinnear both play characters that are unlikeable and reprehensible, at least at the start of the film.  Next thing you know, you're 30 minutes into the film, and there have been maybe a couple of laughs.  That's bad when the movie is supposed to be a comedy.The sad thing is that the cast is talented and funny, and have all done much better work - from the amazing Ricky Gervais (the BBC Office, The Invention of Lying) to Tea Leoni (Flirting with Disaster, Flying Blind) to Kristin Wiig (SNL).  The writer is responsible for well over a billion dollars of box office, including the original Mission Impossible.  On paper, this movie is dynamite.  Unfortunately, for me it just didn't translate into anything funny on screen.  My guess is that the writer is relatively inexperienced as a director, and given that comedy is notoriously hard to direct, ""Ghost Town"" ends up falling flat.However, given that I'm in the minority here, you may want to give this a rent.  What's the worst that could happen?  If you hate it after 30 minutes, kick it out of your player and return it.

There's no other comedian in the world that I think could be more overrated than Gervais, so with that I tried to stay away from this film as long as I could. Unfortunately I got dragged into watching it yesterday and I must say it's simply annoying and typical of my opinion of Gervais' previous work. I guess in a way one of the prime reasons for me hating this film, is that Gervais seems to play himself throughout. I may be on my own here but I just don't see what other people see in Gervais and his work. He's just not funny to me and in my opinion he predictably fell flat in this film.Ghost Town sees dental surgeon Dr. Bertram Pincus going into hospital for a colonoscopy only to find out that he was dead for 7 minutes in the theatre during the procedure. As a result of this he can now see and communicate with the Ghost inhabitants of New York. Enter Greg Kinnears character Frank Helihy who pesters him into breaking up the impending marriage of his widow Gwen (Tea Leoni). What leads is a rom com with quite an annoyingly predictable reasult.I suppose a good reviewer would look for the good points of this movie and focus on them as a way of advertising the thing. I guess one good point would be the small role of Indian comedian Aasif Mandvi as Dr. Pincus dentist colleague.

Then Ricky Gervais dies (Dr. Pincus, a stuck in his ways Britsh dentist). Well, Ricky sort of half dies; the dead can see him and so can the living. The comedy centers around Frank convincing Pincus he can stop Gwen from remarrying.There's several laughs (the naked dead guy was outstanding) and a ton of moments where I smiled. Ricky Gervais is a little tiny bit British Office here (he will have to work very hard to lose that persona), but actually plays the uptight rigid Brit without hamming things up too much. Tea Leoni just seems to get more beautiful as time goes on, she's not a great actress but plays a good love interest for Pincus. Greg Kinnear was outstanding in Flash of Genius, and he carries over some of that goodness in Ghost Town. He is moving more and more out of the B actor realm.Technically there's nothing special about this film, it is done in standard melodrama fashion. It is well filmed, steady, properly exposed, and sound is captured well - the dialog is clear. Pacing is decent; it runs a tad bit long by maybe 15 minutes.

Ricky brings his style of comedy to an oversaturated genre (romantic comedy) and leaves me wanting more.  He is hilarious.Here we have Dr. Pincus (Gervais), a dentist who is not really a people person.  He stays to himself and prefers it that way.  He undergoes a routine surgery but something goes wrong and he dies for about seven minutes, give or take.  The result of this is he now has the ability to see and interact with ghosts who have unfinished business.  One ghost is that of Frank (Kinnear) who wants Pinucs' help getting his widow's new fiance away from her.  Ultimately, and predictably, Pincus falls in love with Gwen.Now, the first part of the movie has the kind of humor we've come to love from Ricky.  He's inappropriate, insensitive and and makes no apologies for it.  This is all good fun for a time, but where the movie really starts to take off is when he gets together with Gwen and we really see how hilarious he can be when working off the dialouge and reactions of another character.  He's almost charming with his witty banter.  Two great scenes are where he's examining the mummy and when he has dinner with Gwen and her fiance in their apartment.There is commentary, which I haven't listened to all of it just yet, but from what I've heard it sounds pretty standard.

I vaguely recall it's release during the September dog days of ""Bangkok Dangerous"" when people are more concerned about getting the kids off to school than visiting the multiplex.  If it lasted more than two weeks I'd be very surprised.  They don't know how to market an intelligent supernatural romance involving fortysomethings (my age bracket for better or for worse) so they treat these films halfheartedly.  The reviews I've read compare it to ""Ghost"" which I consider an unjust comparison, no offense to ""Ghost"" which is a good film.  I think a more apropo comparison would be to the vintage Hollywood comedies like ""Topper"" which had their broad elements that don't compromise wit and style.  Ricky Gervais is spot-on as the anti-social dentist who has the ability to see dead people after a seven minute visit to the afterlife during a botched surgery.  Those familiar with Gervais from the BBC's ""The Office"" and ""Extras"" may be surprised at his ability to handle the tender moments that he's called on to tackle here.  I hope somebody takes note and Hollywood doesn't relegate Gervais to the graveyard parts that his equally talented British compatriot Eddie Izzard found himself in.  Greg Kinnear is charming and smarmy as the ghost who attaches himself to Gervais.  Kinnear consistently finds roles (see the underrated ""Baby Mama"") that plays to his strengths.  Tea Leoni is almost as enigmatic as Gervais.  Leoni over the years has pursued parts that betray her obvious good looks that are challenging and sometimes not too sympathetic(see ""Spanglish"").

Elements of the formula that could have yielded great comedy were so compressed that they became sterile.A scene with SNL's Kristen Wiig  was promising.  Even though I am not a fan of her style, she and Gervais playing off each other was the type of thing I expected (and wanted).  I expected Aasif Mandvi's character to flow from his ""Daily Show"" persona, but here his role was a generic one and used none of his talents (beyond basic acting).The alternative would have been a movie that didn't attempt to have an actual story but used the genre as a vehicle for extended riffs by the comedian(s) (example, the Hope and Crosby ""Road movies"").

Ricky Gervais plays Dr. Bertram Pincus (a name ripe for satire), a socially awkward misanthrope who loves being a dentist because people can't talk to him with a mouth full of cotton and tools.  A job in the morgue might work for this guy except for some squeamishness on his part.  Right from the opening scenes you understand that he's not the friendly sort as after being invited to an office party he sneaks out of the office rather than socialize with his coworkers.After a medical ""incident"" involving a routine procedure he begins to see people no one else can and once these people realize this they won't leave him alone.  The man that hates people suddenly has a whole city of ghosts who want his ear, his worst nightmare.The main Ghost, so to speak, is Frank (Greg Kinnear), who manages to get the other Ghosts to leave Pincus alone (not 100% sure how but he's a persuasive man, errr ghost) in exchange for keeping his widow from marrying a jerk - well he thinks the human rights attorney / medical recruiter for third world countries / good Samaritan is a jerk anyway - is he?  At any rate he thinks it's the reason he's still here as a ghost.  Dr. Pincus has a plan that just may involve himself.Ricky Gervais carries this movie so if you have a predisposition toward him that will likely influence your enjoyment of this film.  If you've not experienced him this may be an introduction for you.  For me I couldn't get enough of his Dr. Pincus.  He plays this self centered man to a tee yet also gets across that he is a human, with feelings, and quite a wry sense of humor.  He also is a master of the incomplete thought and of socially awkward situations.  In one example he calls the woman he's trying to woo an idiot without skipping a beat in his sentence while she and the audience are astonished he's unaware he's done anything the matter.But even while pursuing Gwen (Tea Leoni) he's in it only for himself.  And he never once tries to help any of the pleading ghosts, only Frank because there's something in it for him (getting the other Ghosts off his back).  It takes some tough love from Frank and a dentist colleague in conjunction with a hard loss to set him on a path to redemption.  Once he begins helping and not being selfish he begins to learn how to be a human again.  His realization later on as to why the ghosts are really still here is quite an emotional and unique take on the situation.This is a comedy, yes, but it is also a drama and a well done one with feeling and emotion.

One in particular, Frank, a two faced fast talker played by Greg Kinnear, tries to get Pincus to get a bit closer to his archeologist ex-wife (Tea Leoni) - albeit for some very dubious goals of his own.Ricky Gervais (""The Office"" (UK), ""Extras"") plays the grumpy unsocial dentist in a simply superb way. He displays a range of emotions and comedic skills - often nothing more than a facial expression - unlike anything we've ever seen from him. Pincus' visits to the hospital are exceptionally hilarious and filled with deliciously funny Gervais one-liners.There's a funny cameo from Kristin Wiig, playing her usual ""the awkwardly babbling woman"" character as Pincus' doctor.The only problem with this movie: the story JUST doesn't hold up until the end. When it starts getting closer to the part where Tea Leoni's character begins to get an idea that Pincus ""sees"" Frank, the movie just doesn't know where to go and how to end it.

A taciturn dentist dies for a few moments while under sedation during a hospital visit, and when he wakes up discovers he can see those who have passed on. These restless souls seem to have unfinished business, and they want his help. He, however, has no wish to help. He's not a big fan of the living--which he demonstrates through some humorous early scenes--and has no inclination to be more magnanimous toward the unliving.Greg Kinnear is the principle restless soul in the store, wanting to save his wife (Tea Leoni) from another bad marriage. As usual, Kinnear and Leoni play their parts to comedic perfection, while also introducing some touching moments. But the real revelation, at least for American viewers, is Ricky Gervais. His role as the loner dentist is played to the hilt, and as his character begins a slow transformation, he deftly handles the more touching scenes.This movie had me laughing out loud--it was fun to see SNL's Kristin Wiig in here--and also moved me emotionally.

The story/script isn't much above mediocre, but once Gervais appears he begins to redeem it. And since he is the main character, that amounts to a lot of redemption.It's interesting to me that other reviewers on Amazon and elsewhere describe his character (Bertram Pincus, DDS) as an obnoxious jerk, when it was clear to me that it was the Greg Kinnear character of Frank who was ten times the jerk that Dr. Pincus was. What; we're supposed to tolerate incompetent medical professionals as well as non-stop gasbags? Also, I'm willing to go out on a limb here and suggest that it might be just a wee bit distracting to be followed around by ghosts-with-an-agenda everywhere...But never mind - ""Ghost Town"" isn't the sort of movie where one should burden themselves with picking apart characters and plot points. I do wish, however, that Tea Leoni's paleontologist character had been a bit less neurotic and weepy. Her portrayal seemed one of a totally unstable person (emotionally), and it gave me the impression that the writer glibly views all women as being this way.

And, yes, I'm even including Ricky Gervais' grumpy dentist character on that last point, as it's quite charming to see him resist his generally cynical, non-humanitarian personality when he's around Tea Leoni's character, whom he is clearly falling for despite his irascibility.In addition to the main storyline involving a man who can see ghosts as a result of a near-death experience, there are many funny sequences that would be at home in any strong comedy.  These include a particular standout: a scene where Ricky's character finds it impossible, despite his pointed and incisive grilling, to get his doctor and the hospital staff to clearly, unwaveringly admit that he technically died on the table for a few minutes during a routine procedure.  Maybe the scene came off as really funny because health care is on everyone's minds these days, but whatever the reason the scene worked like gangbusters.Greg Kinnear also did his usual excellent job, crafting a character with much the same challenge as Ricky Gervais' character: having to be generally unlikable to serve the storyline but needing to be a little sympathetic, too, to help maintain the overall frothy tone of the piece.""Ghost Town"" looks and sounds great on standard DVD, and has a variety of amusing special feaures, including a gag reel showing how often Ricky Gervais breaks up while trying to read his lines, often testing the patience of his co-stars.",4,"A little fantasy, a little romance, a lot of good comedy",1252886400,"09 14, 2009",2009,1533,"['Ghost', 'Town', 'warm', 'winning', 'comedy', 'due', 'clever', 'premise', 'generous', 'laughs', 'likable', 'characters', 'yes', ""'m"", 'even', 'including', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'grumpy', 'dentist', 'character', 'last', 'point', 'quite', 'charming', 'see', 'resist', 'generally', 'cynical', 'non-humanitarian', 'personality', 'when', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'character', 'whom', 'clearly', 'falling', 'irascibility.In', 'addition', 'main', 'storyline', 'involving', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'ghosts', 'result', 'near-death', 'experience', 'are', 'many', 'funny', 'sequences', 'would', 'be', 'home', 'strong', 'comedy', 'include', 'particular', 'standout', 'scene', 'where', 'Ricky', 'character', 'impossible', 'pointed', 'incisive', 'grilling', 'get', 'doctor', 'hospital', 'staff', 'clearly', 'unwaveringly', 'admit', 'technically', 'died', 'table', 'few', 'minutes', 'routine', 'procedure', 'Maybe', 'scene', 'came', 'off', 'really', 'funny', 'health', 'care', 'everyone', 'minds', 'days', 'reason', 'scene', 'worked', 'gangbusters.Greg', 'Kinnear', 'also', 'did', 'usual', 'excellent', 'job', 'crafting', 'character', 'much', 'same', 'challenge', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'character', 'having', 'be', 'generally', 'unlikable', 'serve', 'storyline', 'needing', 'be', 'little', 'sympathetic', 'too', 'help', 'maintain', 'overall', 'frothy', 'tone', 'piece', 'Ghost', 'Town', 'great', 'standard', 'DVD', 'variety', 'amusing', 'special', 'feaures', 'including', 'gag', 'reel', 'showing', 'how', 'often', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'up', 'trying', 'read', 'lines', 'often', 'testing', 'patience', 'co-stars']",N/A

Due to an unfortunate glitch during a routine colonoscopy a  crotchety, nasty dentist (Gervais) suffers from ghost harassment. One slick ghost (Kinnear) makes a deal with the dentist. If said dentist will mess up the Kinnear's widow's romance with a new man, Kinnear will keep the other ghosts at bay.In the process lives are changed, non-lives are changed and the laughs come often. There are definitely moments that are not child appropriate. A few F-bombs, an affair, an oft mentioned male body part joke, and some double entendres/outright sexual comments make it mature viewing only.Despite the few negatives as mentioned above, Ghost Town has a deep message and is charming and almost old-fashioned in the romance department. The colonoscopy prep and hospital check-in alone are almost worth the price of a rental. Then you have the quirk of Tea Leoni's laugh and two pretty hilarious prat falls.

He was brilliant as his character developed from a dull, antisocial and disagreeable British dentist displaced in NYC and bent on avoiding contact with about everyone around him, to a wonderfully funny and love-sick single man who realized a life of service with an ingredient of love will get him much further than his lonely existence.

It was very appropriately advertised with a reference to the line spoken in ""The Sixth Sense"" by little Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), ""I see dead people"" - instead they say of the central character played by Ricky Gervais ""He sees dead people - and they annoy him.""Imagine ""The sixth sense"" remade as a comedy, with Haley Joel Osment's little boy replaced by a misanthropic dentist with the people skills of David Brent from ""The Office"" and you have ""Ghost Town"" which is at times very funny, at times quite touching, and always entertaining.Doctor Bertram Pincus (Gervais) is an misanthropic English dentist working in New York. He likes his job because most of the people he meets cannot talk back to him when he's working on their teeth and because it's a job in which the fact that he is incredibly rude to everyone doesn't matter too much. Imagine a cross between the ""boss from hell"" characters Ricky Gervais plays as the museum director in ""Night at the Museum"" and David Brent in ""the office.""In the first few minutes of the film most viewers will wonder whether Bertram Pincus is so rude because he hates people or because most of the people he meets are complete idiots. You rapidly realise that he really does dislike people but an awful lot - not all - of the people he meets give him reason to. A lot of the humour of the film is based on Pincus insulting people: around 50% of the time the joke is that the character actually dares to say the things which most of us would think but never dream of speaking aloud. The other half of the time Ricky gervase is seeing how outrageous he can be.Then Dr Pincus goes into hospital for a routine operation on his colon, dies on the operating table and is brought back to life. When he recovers he can see and hear all the many ghosts who are haunting New York.As in many ghost-story films, the premise is that dead people who stay around on earth do so because they have unfinished business. As soon as they realise that Pincus can see and hear them, he is besieged by ghosts who want him to help them take care of the various things they have left behind.A ghost called Frank (Greg Kinnear) had been an unscrupulous but persuasive rat who cheated on his archaologist wife Gwen (Tea Leoni). He convinces himself that the business he had to complete is to stop his widow making another bad marriage, and as the human rights lawyer who is now courting her (Bill Campbell) seems too good to be true, he persuades Pincus to try to break up their romance.To stop himself being pestered by the dead, Pincus has to abandon years of treating the living like dirt and try to act like a decent human being ...A certain number of plot inconsistencies, but in general this is a very good, professionally made film which was great fun to watch.

There must have been at least three different scenes where he gags - and I don't find that amusing.

He uses a hitch in his delivery that works very well.  He starts the line quickly, pauses, and then he delivers the final word as punctuation to the joke.  He begins the movie a miserable man, and he protrays misery in a subtle manner.  There are a few scenes in which he goes the extra yard to drive the point home, but for the most part it's very subtle.  This was done very well, because for the most part people don't know they're miserable until it's too late.  The character doesn't know and doesn't think he needs to be rescued.  He just wants to crawl into his little world and be left alone.  He doesn't want to venture out into the world, because he's been hurt before. Very rarely is he outwardly rude to people.

Without him it would have been another semi-cliched redux ofGhostgiven the romantic comedy treatment. His performance as DR. Pincus, an acerbic, anti-social dentist who wakes up from a surgery to discover that he can see (and be seen by) ghosts, is spot on. He is able to portray Dr. Pincus' particular brand of obnoxious people loathing with an affability that allows the viewer to sympathize with him. If the character was a shade less well acted, he would be insufferable.The movie follows that now well-worn path of virtually every tale about those who can see ghosts, which might have been disastrous, except for the quick wit of the protagonist. He is able to level out some of the broader cliches that might have otherwise mired the film. The plot line might not be surprising, but it was entertaining.On problem I had with the movie was that the romance that develops between Dr. Pincus and the wife of a ghost named Frank (Greg Kinnear) whom he has befriended, is a bit hard to relate to on several levels. First, it seems implausible that a woman (T&eacute;a Leoni) as beautiful, intelligent, and sensitive as she  would be taken with a plump, average looking man with deplorable people skills. Second, there is zero chemistry between the two actors, and it seems Director David Koepp was aware of that fact: the two essentially never touch one another throughout the entire film. For a romantic comedy, that is an anathema.As an examination of the road to redemption for someone who has chosen to isolate themselves from rest of the human race, the movie works. As a fun if slightly superficial ghost tale, it also works. As a romance, not so much. The film is quite funny, entertaining, and if you enjoy THE OFFICE, HOUSE, ghost stories, or have a soft-spot for romantic comedies even if the romance is on the weak side, GHOST TOWN won't disappoint you.3.5/5 Stars.

But for those willing to take a visit to GHOST TOWN, you'll find him to be a pleasantly agreeable star after-all.Not that Gervais' Dr. Pincus, a dentist, is pleasant. He's a quiet man, eager to do all he can to stay away from his fellow man, whether by sneaking past an office party for the exit, or not holding an elevator door open for a fellow apartment building dweller. He has disdain for ALL of mankind, and chose the life of a dentist because he can pretty much keep his patients from talking by opening their mouths and shoving things in them. Gervais, as we know from his work on THE OFFICE and EXTRAS, is perfect at this sort of misanthropic character. Unengaged with those around him, full of easy (and hilarious) contempt. The smart remarks he tosses off under his breath are quite funny. Frankly, he reminded me of something akin to Hugh Grant's older, more unpleasant brother.Early in the film, Dr. Pincus goes in to the hospital for some minor surgery in a very indelicate spot on his body. To avoid the humiliation, he insists on a general anesthetic...and something goes wrong. He dies for seven minutes (""a little less than seven""), and when he comes to, he can suddenly see, be seen by, and interact with ghosts. And New York City is FULL of ghosts. They're all ""people"" with unfinished business, and in Dr. Pincus, they see a chance to finally get someone to finish their business for them so they can ""move on."" One particular ghost, played with his usual oily ease, is Greg Kinnear, who wants Gervais to bust up the impending marriage between his widow (Tea Leoni) and a no-good human rights attorney (Billy Campbell...looking 15 years older all of a sudden). Gervais only agrees to try this because a) Kinnear can get the other ghosts to leave him alone, and b) he actually finds Leoni interesting.If all this sounds very familiar, I'll admit right here that although I've never seen this EXACT formula, it does sound like a mix of ghost movies from TOPPER to GHOST. But GHOST TOWN is its own unique creation, primarily because Gervais is unlike any other actor we've seen in such a role. He's an amazingly quick wit. Listen carefully, and you'll find yourself laughing out loud at half the things he says. He also is quite convincing when he begins to open up his heart just a little bit more. We see, of course, that there is a good but wounded man underneath all the nastiness.The film holds no real surprises, but it does get many familiar pleasures right. That Leoni has never become a bigger star has always dismayed me...she's super intelligent but excellent at vulnerability...and she's capable of being funny as hell. In GHOST TOWN, she and Gervais develop a most tentative but very engaging relationship. It is...dare I say it...sweet.Kinnear and the supporting cast are all okay, but nothing more. There are some moving moments near the end involving the other ghosts...but mostly, this is Gervais' film...ably assisted by Leoni. It feels old fashioned yet modern too. And if it weren't for two totally unneeded ""f-bombs""...it would be quite suitable for ages 13 and up. But then again, this is a love story about two folks in their `40s...how many people will THAT turn off? For me, a man IN his `40s...I liked it and hope that the film finds the audience it deserves.",4,Gervais does a rom-com!!

It would have been easy to botch this movie and make him unlikeable..... but a clever and delicate balance has been achieved.Tea Leoni has played some brittle and prickily characters in some past films but here her character is supremely likeable.

All the other supporting actors are excellent (especially the female surgeon. Check the classic scene where she and the Gervais character constantly interrupt each other.)Greg Kinnear is always excellent and his contribution to this project could be easily underestimated. He's not the main character but he is like a catalyst..... without which the whole film would fail to fire.Production values are excellent with terrific iconic shots of New York.

This is a re-watchable film that I think most guys will dig; The majority of the screen time contains the dialogue/schtick of Kinnear & Gervais but the ladies will obviously love the whole romcom thing.For not being a high-budgeted FX film, the CG looked very presentable and did not show any real artifact on the BD. The docus are the same as on the DVD. The main docu has plenty of info on the making of the film, the Ghostly Effects is a short, uneventful clip on how they interlaced the CG, but it does provide one surprise on a scene that did not appear to be CG. The highlight though, especially for Gervais fans is the Some People Can Do It feature, which is actually the outtakes and bloopers - hilarious.The colors were outstanding on the BD for having so many interior shots, and some of the NY exteriors looked outstanding in HD.

He plays a straight man (in the comedic sense) so well that it allows others to make jokes of him or around him that keep the audience laughing without ever realizing that the humor is all his.Ghost Town also features, of course, a town full of ghosts, not the least is which is the character played by Greg Kinnear.  An adulterer that seems to have unfinished business with his widow that he needs the help of Gervais' Dr. Pincus to help resolve.Thanks to what some would call a near death experience while having a routine medical procedure done Dr. Pincus sees dead people (ghosts) all around him.  Even though Dr. Pincus would like nothing more than to continue to live his lonely existence, getting the ghosts to leave him alone might not be possible if he doesn't cooperate a little.T&eacute;a Leoni plays Kinnear's widow and soon inspires Dr. Pincus to reach out and open himself up, but not, of course, without comedic results.Ghost Town includes wonderful writing and top shelf acting from everyone involved.  In the sparce extras on the Blu-ray version there's a gag reel that shows some of the fun that the cast had making the film.  There's also a featurette that shows a little of how the effects were done for the film.The Picture quality is good on the Blu-ray, though much of the film takes place indoors so we don't get the benefits of panoramic or majestic background scenery to take in and awe inspire us.Well worth viewing, even if many elements of the film date back to other films and TV shows.

1213594,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B001L58000,Turfseer,"[2, 13]","Ghost Town is similar to 'Groundhog Day' in that a misanthrope must undergo a series of tests before he can be transformed into an empathetic human being. Ricky Gervais plays the misanthrope dentist, Dr. Bertram Pincus, who goes in for a routine colonoscopy and while under anesthesia for seven minutes stops breathing and ends up clinically dead (we never see any of this near-death scene while he's on the operating table and one wonders whether that scene was cut during editing). Somehow he's revived but when he walks out on the street he's suddenly able to see ghosts who are all hounding him to resolve their own unresolved conflicts with the living.Greg Kinnear plays the recently departed Frank Herlihy who becomes Pincus's buddy of sorts and acts as an intermediary between Pincus and all the ghosts seeking his attention (it's never really explained very well how Frank convinces his fellow ghosts to stop hounding Pincus).Frank's ex-wife, Gwen, has a new boyfriend, a human rights lawyer who Frank suspects is up to no good. He enlists Pincus to look after Gwen but he ends up falling in love with her. It turns out that Frank's suspicions about the lawyer are unfounded especially after the lawyer gives Pincus mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and saves him after he's hit by a bus.Part of Ghost Town's problem is that Pincus remains clueless for far too long and only a heart-to-heart conversation with his Indian dentist colleague convinces him to change his ways (why the colleague is so suddenly able to work wonders with the thoroughly disagreeable Dr. Pincus where others have failed, is beyond me). Furthermore, I was expecting something a lot more clever to transform Dr. Pincus into a good guy.After Dr. Pincus does 'see the light', in 'Groundhog Day' fashion, he does various good deeds for the all the ghosts, which releases them from the limbo world they've been living in and allows them to migrate (presumably to) heaven. Pincus's acts of kindness that help the ghosts back to heaven are all simple deeds (such as recovering a child's toy from underneath a car seat); but when he helps Frank it's something much more intangible. It seems Gwen has been 'holding on' to Frank and now must let him go. When Pincus convinces Gwen to 'move on', that's when Frank can 'move on' too.Ghost Town can also be compared to the far superior movie, 'Ghost', starring Patrick Swayze. Whereas Ghost worked in good part because of a strong antagonist (remember how it's the hero's best friend who murders him and tries to steal his wife), here in Ghost Town, Frank is a much more muddled adversary. In fact, he's much more of a buddy to Pincus than someone who is trying to do him in.With some more judicious editing along with making better use of the ghosts (who end up being nothing more than a group of useless buffoons), Ghost Town could have been a lot tighter and more engaging comedy than the finished product we have here.",2,A lesser 'Groundhog Day' and 'Ghost',1236988800,"03 14, 2009",2009,2937,"['Ghost', 'Town', 'similar', ""'Groundhog"", 'Day', 'misanthrope', 'must', 'undergo', 'series', 'tests', 'can', 'be', 'transformed', 'empathetic', 'human', 'being', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'misanthrope', 'dentist', 'Dr.', 'Bertram', 'Pincus', 'who', 'routine', 'colonoscopy', 'anesthesia', 'seven', 'minutes', 'stops', 'breathing', 'up', 'clinically', 'dead', 'never', 'see', 'near-death', 'scene', 'operating', 'table', 'one', 'wonders', 'scene', 'was', 'cut', 'editing', 'Somehow', 'revived', 'when', 'out', 'street', 'suddenly', 'able', 'see', 'ghosts', 'who', 'are', 'hounding', 'resolve', 'own', 'unresolved', 'conflicts', 'living.Greg', 'Kinnear', 'recently', 'departed', 'Frank', 'Herlihy', 'who', 'Pincus', 'buddy', 'sorts', 'acts', 'intermediary', 'Pincus', 'ghosts', 'seeking', 'attention', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'very', 'well', 'how', 'Frank', 'fellow', 'ghosts', 'stop', 'hounding', 'Pincus', '.Frank', 'ex-wife', 'Gwen', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'human', 'rights', 'lawyer', 'who', 'Frank', 'good', 'Pincus', 'look', 'Gwen', 'up', 'falling', 'love', 'out', 'Frank', 'suspicions', 'lawyer', 'are', 'unfounded', 'especially', 'lawyer', 'Pincus', 'mouth-to-mouth', 'resuscitation', 'hit', 'bus.Part', 'Ghost', 'Town', 'problem', 'Pincus', 'clueless', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'only', 'heart-to-heart', 'conversation', 'Indian', 'dentist', 'colleague', 'change', 'ways', 'why', 'colleague', 'so', 'suddenly', 'able', 'work', 'wonders', 'thoroughly', 'disagreeable', 'Dr.', 'Pincus', 'where', 'others', 'have', 'failed', 'Furthermore', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'lot', 'more', 'clever', 'transform', 'Dr.', 'Pincus', 'good', 'guy.After', 'Dr.', 'Pincus', ""'see"", 'light', ""'Groundhog"", 'Day', 'fashion', 'various', 'good', 'deeds', 'ghosts', 'limbo', 'world', ""'ve"", 'been', 'living', 'migrate', 'presumably', 'heaven', 'Pincus', 'acts', 'kindness', 'help', 'ghosts', 'back', 'heaven', 'are', 'simple', 'deeds', 'such', 'recovering', 'child', 'toy', 'car', 'seat', 'when', 'Frank', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'intangible', 'Gwen', 'been', ""'holding"", 'Frank', 'now', 'must', 'let', 'go', 'When', 'Pincus', 'Gwen', ""'move"", 'when', 'Frank', 'can', ""'move"", 'too.Ghost', 'Town', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'compared', 'far', 'superior', 'movie', 'starring', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'Whereas', 'Ghost', 'worked', 'good', 'part', 'strong', 'antagonist', 'remember', 'how', 'hero', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'tries', 'steal', 'wife', 'here', 'Ghost', 'Town', 'Frank', 'much', 'more', 'muddled', 'adversary', 'fact', 'much', 'more', 'buddy', 'Pincus', 'someone', 'who', 'trying', 'do', 'in.With', 'more', 'judicious', 'editing', 'making', 'better', 'use', 'ghosts', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'nothing', 'more', 'group', 'useless', 'buffoons', 'Ghost', 'Town', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'tighter', 'more', 'engaging', 'comedy', 'finished', 'product', 'have', 'here']",N/A

1213596,A1TEX8B0WPHVBS,B001L58000,"William Porter ""William Porter Photography""","[0, 0]","There are a lot of ghosts in this movie, and I am not just talking about the characters. I'm thinking of the ghost of Shrek, or the Jack Nicholson character in As Good as it Gets, or perhaps even Ebenezer Scrooge -- especially Bill Murray's turbo-charged portrayal of the old humbug in the movie Scrooged. Like these characters in stories from the past, the main character of Ghost Town, played by Ricky Gervais, is an antisocial misanthrope. In the course of the movie, his heart opens up and he is saved -- by love. All pretty standard, in general terms.But the specifics are somewhat novel. Gervais' character, Dr Pincus, dies temporarily during a colonoscopy that goes off the rails, and when he is released from the hospital, he discovers that he can see and hear ghosts -- a fact that horrifies him but excites the ghosts, because they have ""unresolved issues"" that they need somebody who's living to help them with.The key thing is that this gentle story is told really well. The plot has some delightful symmetries. At first it seems as if the main character has been made a dentist simply so we can see him stuffing things into his patients' mouths to shut them up. But no, the plot turns on his occupation: He is able to make a dental diagnosis after looking at the teeth of an Egyptian mummy that makes it possible for him to get close to the lovely Tea Leoni. We learn the touching back stories of several of the ghosts.But in the end, this is a comedy and a very good one. My wife and I laughed along with our nineteen-year old daughter from one scene to another. The scene in the hospital where Gervais learns from the doctor and the hospital's lawyer that he was technically dead for seven minutes (""less than seven minutes,"" the lawyer corrects) is a side-splitting classic, but there are plenty of great scenes. It's not quite a five-star comedy like, oh, several of Bill Murray's greatest hits: What About Bob? or Scrooged, or Groundhog Day, or Rushmore. But it's a totally solid four-star effort.Two small notes -- one positive, one negative.The positive has to do with the character of Tea Leoni's new boyfriend/fianc&eacute;. We are introduced to him through the eyes of Greg Kinnear, Leoni's recently-dead husband, who is, of course, jealous of his replacement. So we think at first that the new boyfriend is a fraud or a gold-digger or something worse. But he's not. He is instead exactly what he appears to be: a humorless guy, maybe even a bit pompous, but in the end, a good and decent man.The negative has to do with a single word. We watched Ghost Town again recently after seeing another wonderful indie film, Today's Special, which stars Aasif Mandvi (Ghost Town, Today's Special, The Proposal, The Dictator, Spiderman 2). Mandvi plays a small but important part in Ghost Town as the other dentist that Ricky Gervais shares an office with. Mandvi's gentle humanitarian Hindu dentist is a perfect foil to the people-hating Gervais. And so it's appropriate that it is Mandvi who finally gives Gervais the diagnosis that he desperately needs to hear: that he's a jerk. Unfortunately, the writers nodded here, because the line that Mandvi, if he were real, would have uttered (""You're a jerk"") is badly marred by the addition of an f-bomb (""You're an f-ing jerk""). Utterly inappropriate to Mandvi's character and jarring. It's a pathetic commentary on our society that Hollywood writers feel the need to avoid that dreaded PG rating.But now you've been warned about that -- and it's just about the only false-step in an otherwise very sure-footed story. I recommend it.",4,"Gentle, touching and hilarious",1401667200,"06 2, 2014",2014,3595,"['are', 'lot', 'ghosts', 'movie', 'am', 'not', 'just', 'talking', 'characters', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'ghost', 'Shrek', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'character', 'As', 'Good', 'perhaps', 'even', 'Ebenezer', 'Scrooge', 'especially', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'turbo-charged', 'portrayal', 'old', 'humbug', 'movie', 'Scrooged', 'characters', 'stories', 'past', 'main', 'character', 'Ghost', 'Town', 'played', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'antisocial', 'misanthrope', 'course', 'movie', 'heart', 'up', 'saved', 'love', 'pretty', 'standard', 'general', 'terms.But', 'specifics', 'are', 'somewhat', 'novel', 'Gervais', 'character', 'Dr', 'Pincus', 'temporarily', 'colonoscopy', 'rails', 'when', 'released', 'hospital', 'can', 'see', 'hear', 'ghosts', 'fact', 'ghosts', 'have', 'unresolved', 'issues', 'need', 'somebody', 'who', 'living', 'help', 'with.The', 'key', 'thing', 'gentle', 'story', 'told', 'really', 'well', 'plot', 'delightful', 'symmetries', 'first', 'main', 'character', 'been', 'made', 'dentist', 'simply', 'can', 'see', 'stuffing', 'things', 'patients', 'mouths', 'shut', 'up', 'plot', 'occupation', 'able', 'make', 'dental', 'diagnosis', 'looking', 'teeth', 'Egyptian', 'mummy', 'possible', 'get', 'close', 'lovely', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'learn', 'touching', 'back', 'stories', 'several', 'ghosts.But', 'end', 'comedy', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'wife', 'laughed', 'along', 'nineteen-year', 'old', 'daughter', 'one', 'scene', 'scene', 'hospital', 'where', 'Gervais', 'doctor', 'hospital', 'lawyer', 'was', 'technically', 'dead', 'seven', 'minutes', 'less', 'seven', 'minutes', 'lawyer', 'corrects', 'side-splitting', 'classic', 'are', 'plenty', 'great', 'scenes', 'not', 'quite', 'five-star', 'comedy', 'oh', 'several', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'greatest', 'hits', 'What', 'Bob', 'Scrooged', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'Rushmore', 'totally', 'solid', 'four-star', 'effort.Two', 'small', 'notes', 'one', 'positive', 'one', 'negative.The', 'positive', 'do', 'character', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'new', 'boyfriend/fianc', 'eacute', 'are', 'introduced', 'eyes', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Leoni', 'recently-dead', 'husband', 'who', 'course', 'jealous', 'replacement', 'think', 'first', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'fraud', 'gold-digger', 'something', 'worse', 'not', 'instead', 'exactly', 'what', 'be', 'humorless', 'guy', 'maybe', 'even', 'bit', 'pompous', 'end', 'good', 'decent', 'man.The', 'negative', 'do', 'single', 'word', 'watched', 'Ghost', 'Town', 'again', 'recently', 'seeing', 'wonderful', 'indie', 'film', 'Today', 'Special', 'Aasif', 'Mandvi', 'Ghost', 'Town', 'Today', 'Special', 'Proposal', 'Dictator', 'Spiderman', '2', 'Mandvi', 'small', 'important', 'part', 'Ghost', 'Town', 'other', 'dentist', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'shares', 'office', 'Mandvi', 'gentle', 'humanitarian', 'Hindu', 'dentist', 'perfect', 'foil', 'people-hating', 'Gervais', 'appropriate', 'Mandvi', 'who', 'finally', 'Gervais', 'diagnosis', 'desperately', 'hear', 'jerk', 'Unfortunately', 'writers', 'nodded', 'here', 'line', 'Mandvi', 'were', 'real', 'would', 'have', 'uttered', ""'re"", 'jerk', 'badly', 'marred', 'addition', 'f-bomb', ""'re"", 'f-ing', 'jerk', 'Utterly', 'inappropriate', 'Mandvi', 'character', 'jarring', 'pathetic', 'commentary', 'society', 'Hollywood', 'writers', 'feel', 'need', 'avoid', 'dreaded', 'PG', 'rating.But', 'now', ""'ve"", 'been', 'warned', 'just', 'only', 'false-step', 'otherwise', 'very', 'sure-footed', 'story', 'recommend']",N/A
