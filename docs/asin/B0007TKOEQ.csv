After watching a few shows Branded became part of our viewing schedule. This set of DVD's like Volume 1 can use better video restoration. This becomes more evident in the color episodes of Season 2. What makes this set so nice is the bonus feature with a complete interview with the creator of Branded, Mr. Cohen.Cohen, (who was also involved with the show ""The Invaders"" and other TV shows), discusses the idea and creation of  the show in great detail. It was a show shunned by NBC but loved by Proctor and Gamble which was a big NBC sponsor. The scheduling of Branded was a strategic move by NBC and Proctor and Gamble to keep viewers on NBC as it was sandwiched between Disney's Wonderful World of Color and Bonanza. Cohen talks about the up and down relationships with Chuck Connors and the various producers. The interview and his comments are worth the value of this DVD set.Now that this DVD set has been combined as season 1 and 2, is this bonus feature still there.",4,Better Video Tranfer needed BUT GREAT BONUS FEATURES,1323907200,"12 15, 2011",2011,1095,"['was', 'elementary', 'school', 'when', 'Branded', 'came', 'out', 'remembered', 'came', 'Bonanza', 'were', 'waiting', 'watching', 'few', 'shows', 'Branded', 'became', 'part', 'viewing', 'schedule', 'set', 'DVD', 'like', 'Volume', '1', 'can', 'use', 'better', 'video', 'restoration', 'more', 'evident', 'color', 'episodes', 'Season', '2', 'What', 'set', 'so', 'nice', 'bonus', 'feature', 'complete', 'interview', 'creator', 'Branded', 'Mr.', 'Cohen.Cohen', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'involved', 'show', 'Invaders', 'other', 'TV', 'shows', 'idea', 'creation', 'show', 'great', 'detail', 'was', 'show', 'shunned', 'NBC', 'loved', 'Proctor', 'Gamble', 'was', 'big', 'NBC', 'sponsor', 'scheduling', 'Branded', 'was', 'strategic', 'move', 'NBC', 'Proctor', 'Gamble', 'keep', 'viewers', 'NBC', 'was', 'sandwiched', 'Disney', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'Color', 'Bonanza', 'Cohen', 'talks', 'up', 'relationships', 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'various', 'producers', 'interview', 'comments', 'are', 'value', 'DVD', 'set.Now', 'DVD', 'set', 'been', 'combined', 'season', '1', '2', 'bonus', 'feature', 'still', 'there']",N/A

Of course it's fictional, but I enjoyed it very much! Unlike the majority of people, I also enjoyed the last two episodes.  Of course, I'm a sucker for romance and hate to see anyone having to be a wanderer, not finding their ""place"" in this world.
