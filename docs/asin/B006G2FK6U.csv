And not only that...he survived Nazi persecution because of the aid of a Muslim religious Imam of the Paris Mosque - Si Kaddour Benghabrit.This is but one of the story threads of a movie focused on the assistance offered North African Jewish refugees by the Paris Mosque during World War II, defying the Nazis and bringing these two groups together.  In my view, with the renewed possibility of peace between Palestine and Israel, it is valuable to learn that these two groups should, indeed must learn to live like brothers again.Most of the movie centers around a young Arab man, interested in making money in the black market of Paris, who develops a conscience in his encounter with Salim Halali, the singer I began this post talking about.  It is not a perfect film - think of it as an Arab/Jew version of Fascist Resistance in the mode of Rosselini's Italian Neorealist classic - ""Rome - Open City.""Don't let me forget to say that Arab music permeates just about every frame of this film - and that is the best part for lovers of this genre.

1514878,A328S9RN3U5M68,B006G2FK6U,Grady Harp,"[6, 6]","Ismal Ferroukhi both wrote (with Alain-Michel Blanc) and directed this emotionally charged story based on fact and peppered with real and fictitious characters to drive home the point of the film - that differences among peoples become erased in response to a common enemy. This is a powerful little film made more radiant because of the brilliant cast.In German occupied Paris in WW II there is a segment of Algerian and Moroccan immigrants who survive on the fringes largely due to people like the unemployed Younes (the handsome and gifted French actor of Algerian origin Tahir Rahim) who runs a black market selling cigarettes, tea, coffee and food to his fellow Algerians - until he is caught by the police. Instead to going to prison he is set up to spy on the Paris Mosque, thought by the police to be center for the Mosque authorities, including its rector Ben Ghabrit (Michael Lonsdale) of aiding Muslim Resistance agents and helping North African Jews by giving them false certificates. At the Mosque, Younes meets the Algerian singer Salim Halali (Mahmud Shalaby), and is moved by Salim's beautiful voice and strong personality. When Younes discovers that Salim is Jewish, he stops collaborating with the police and gradually transforms from a politically ignorant immigrant black marketeer into a fully-fledged freedom fighter. It is this friendship between Younes and Salim that shapes the changes in Younes character, allowing him to move form a non-political opportunist to a committed freedom fighter.There are many side stories that occur - the influence of the Gestapo, the presence of the mysterious Leila (the profoundly gifted and beautiful Lubna Azabal), Vichy collaborators, Muslims, Jews, Christians, resistance fighters, communists, spies, snitches, fugitives, traitors, criminals, children and innocents - with the theme of discovered camaraderie emerging slowly but surely. This is an inspired film that opens windows to parts of WW II history little known to the general public, and at films end the history of the post war activities of those character who are real is revealed, with `Younes' being described as the general representative of all the Algerian and Jewish immigrants.  The score is filled with the singing of Salim/Mahmud Shalaby that adds a definite feeling of authenticity to the film.  In French and Arabic with English subtitles.

1514879,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B006G2FK6U,J. Martin,"[0, 6]","Tahar Rahim plays Younes, a young Algerian in Paris during the Nazi occupation, planning to return to Algeria after he gets rich on the black market. Instead, he ends up joining the Resistance and helping a few Jews escape through the Paris mosque.Rahim is a gifted actor. I first saw him inA Prophet, a so-so prison movie in which he gave a fantastic performance. Free Men has a great performance by Michael Lonsdale as the head of the mosque, and maybe that's why Rahim seems less impressive in this movie than he was in A Prophet. A Prophet made me an instant fan, but if I'd seen Free Men first I don't think that would have happened; Rahim is good in it, but not fantastic.Another problem I have with Free Men is that the central relationship is between Younes and a young Jewish singer of North African music named Salim who has survived because the mosque gave him false ID as a Moslem. The friendship between Younes and Salim is supposed to be inspiring (I think), but it just annoyed the hell out of me.First, the actor who plays Salim is an Arab, not a Jew, and he looks like an Arab, not a Jew. Trying to see the character as a Jew is practically impossible, but his Jewishness is key to the movie. If their friendship is supposed to exemplify some sort of grand utopian harmony between Arabs and Jews, it fails.Second, Salim is supposed to be the world's greatest singer of North African music, but to me it was nearly unbearable, just a bunch of ugly, whiny, screechy, nasal noise. I don't mean to offend North Africans, but their music doesn't sound like music to me (Lots of American music is even worse, though, including punk, heavy metal and rap).Plus, the guy playing Salim is so ugly that I couldn't look at him for more than a few seconds at a time; he has weird eyes that reminded me of the Emperor's yellow eyes in The Empire Strikes Back (or maybe it was Return of the Jedi), only Salim's are a strange unnatural blue color. Better casting of that role might have helped this movie a lot.So I don't recommend Free Men. The only things I enjoyed were Lonsdale's performance and seeing a sort of street-level view of what Paris may have been like under the Nazis, which I don't think I'd ever seen before.",2,Not much good except for Michael Lonsdale,1350691200,"10 20, 2012",2012,2227,"['Tahar', 'Rahim', 'Younes', 'young', 'Algerian', 'Paris', 'Nazi', 'occupation', 'planning', 'return', 'Algeria', 'rich', 'black', 'market', 'Instead', 'up', 'joining', 'Resistance', 'helping', 'few', 'Jews', 'escape', 'Paris', 'mosque.Rahim', 'gifted', 'actor', 'first', 'saw', 'inA', 'Prophet', 'so-so', 'prison', 'movie', 'gave', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'Free', 'Men', 'great', 'performance', 'Michael', 'Lonsdale', 'head', 'mosque', 'maybe', 'why', 'Rahim', 'less', 'impressive', 'movie', 'was', 'A', 'Prophet', 'A', 'Prophet', 'made', 'instant', 'fan', ""'d"", 'seen', 'Free', 'Men', 'first', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'Rahim', 'good', 'not', 'fantastic.Another', 'problem', 'have', 'Free', 'Men', 'central', 'relationship', 'Younes', 'young', 'Jewish', 'singer', 'North', 'African', 'music', 'named', 'Salim', 'who', 'survived', 'mosque', 'gave', 'false', 'ID', 'Moslem', 'friendship', 'Younes', 'Salim', 'supposed', 'be', 'inspiring', 'think', 'just', 'annoyed', 'hell', 'me.First', 'actor', 'who', 'Salim', 'Arab', 'not', 'Jew', 'Arab', 'not', 'Jew', 'Trying', 'see', 'character', 'Jew', 'practically', 'impossible', 'Jewishness', 'key', 'movie', 'friendship', 'supposed', 'exemplify', 'sort', 'grand', 'utopian', 'harmony', 'Arabs', 'Jews', 'fails.Second', 'Salim', 'supposed', 'be', 'world', 'greatest', 'singer', 'North', 'African', 'music', 'was', 'nearly', 'unbearable', 'just', 'bunch', 'ugly', 'whiny', 'screechy', 'nasal', 'noise', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'offend', 'North', 'Africans', 'music', ""n't"", 'sound', 'music', 'Lots', 'American', 'music', 'even', 'worse', 'including', 'punk', 'heavy', 'metal', 'rap', '.Plus', 'guy', 'playing', 'Salim', 'so', 'ugly', 'could', ""n't"", 'look', 'more', 'few', 'seconds', 'time', 'weird', 'eyes', 'reminded', 'Emperor', 'yellow', 'eyes', 'Empire', 'Strikes', 'Back', 'maybe', 'was', 'Return', 'Jedi', 'only', 'Salim', 'are', 'strange', 'unnatural', 'blue', 'color', 'Better', 'casting', 'role', 'might', 'have', 'helped', 'movie', 'lot.So', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'Free', 'Men', 'only', 'things', 'enjoyed', 'were', 'Lonsdale', 'performance', 'seeing', 'sort', 'street-level', 'view', 'what', 'Paris', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Nazis', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen']",Free Men

1514881,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B006G2FK6U,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","There's a terrific and powerful story at the heart of Ismael Ferroukhi's ""Free Men,"" one that should have had the ability to really connect at an emotional and visceral level. Set in German-occupied Paris during World War II, the screenplay tells the classic tale of a reluctant hero. In this case, though, that hero is an opportunistic Algerian immigrant making whatever compromises he needs to in order to survive. It's an interesting perspective to see the ever-increasing horrors from a Muslim vantage point. A Paris Mosque is one of the bases for the resistance, but our protagonist has very little connection to any side but himself. When ensnared by the police, he agrees to turn informant. But as he gets closer to the situation and to those that trust him, he becomes more invested in a bigger picture of justice. This is a personal story that could be played on an epic scale, but Ferroukhi keeps things more contained and restrained throughout. I liked this dignified approach, but it also made the central character strangely aloof. That, in the end, keeps ""Free Men"" from being the great film it had the potential to be.Tahar Rahim (so good in ""A Prophet"") plays the central character. Beginning as an exploitative black market vendor, his character arc is truly remarkable as he morphs into a full fledged freedom fighter. It's in some of the details that things get a bit murky. He befriends a popular Jewish singer and this is one of the initializing steps to his amazing (but refreshingly subtle) transformation. He seems, at times, to idol worship the cavalier style and free spirit of his new friend. But aside from partying a bit, the two have little to share with one another. It's a tenuous connection at best, but I guess it's enough to make Rahim realize that his actions have repercussions. The two actors play off one another very well. They make for an intriguing pair although this ""friendship"" remains somewhat enigmatic. More successful, for me, was Rahim's burgeoning relationship with the Mosque's rector. As he grapples with weighty moral decisions, the rector seems to be the only one to really connect with the young man. There is also a small romantic side plot, but it only exists to service the narrative (it is underexplored and introduced only so that her fate will add even more drama) as opposed to feeling like an organic part of Rahim's journey.In the end, ""Free Men"" is a movie that spoke more to my head than to my heart. It's screenplay kept me at a distance throughout. I didn't want to stay on the sidelines, though, I wanted to experience the harrowing subject matter in my gut. Rahim, however, is fascinating to watch throughout. Talking about an emotional punch, the Bonus Short Film on the DVD is ""Lustig."" This 17 minute feature by John Frances Black II deals with survivor's guilt in the aftermath of the war. As a concentration camp victim sojourns to the families of those that didn't escape the war alive, he has quite a tale to tell. Simple, not wholly unexpected, but incredibly resonant, this brief experience is surprisingly moving and effective.

But I am still catching up on some older releases, including this one (January '12 DVD-of-the-Month release).""Free Men"" (2011 release from France; 99 min.) starts off by informing us that the influx of North African immigrants, specially from Morroco and Algeria, into France, and Paris, in particular, came to a stop when WWII broke out in 1939. As the movie opens, we get to know Younes, a young man from Algeria who tries to make ends meet in Nazi-occupied Paris by selling stuff (coffee, cigarettes, etc.) on the black market. Alas, he gets caught by the Paris police and the police chief strikes a deal with Younes: to hang out at the local mosque and see who comes and goes, while keeping the police chief informed. Younes gets to know, and eventually befriends, Salim, another young guy who is making a name for himself as a singer. Younes eventually discovers Salim is Jewish, and now Younes finds himself in a complicated situation: will he inform the police chief of this? or will he instead protect Salim? At this point we are a good one-third into the movie and to tell you more would ruin your viewing experience.Several comments: first, before the movie even starts, we are informed that this story is based on ""true events"" but with fictionalized characters. Which is sort of like having your cake and eating it too: you claim to bring ""the truth"" yet it is impossible to verify or accept as such, since it is an adapted truth with made-up characters. Second, while the movie brings an interesting slice of life from Nazi-occupied Paris, I nevertheless could never fully embrace the movie, for a couple of reasons: (i) it's probably just me but the movie feels more like theatre than a movie (check out for example the scenes in the mosque, as if straight out of Masterpiece Theatre), and (ii) some of the performances come across as wooden and/or aloof (I can just see the director yelling ""action!"" before Tahar Rahim (in the role of Younes) lights up a cigarette and is sitting in a smokey lounge somewhere). This powerful story is really not helped by those shortcomings. Bottom line: this is of course not a bad movie per se (as compared to your standard Hollywood fare), but neither is it one of the stronger releases in the rich Film Movement catalog.

The beginning scenes, especially, in the mosque and in the cabaret were a wonderful glimpse of another culture.  The mosque, especially, was lovely.It's mostly a character driven story about a young Algerian immigrant man who is profiteering by selling goods on the black market soley to make money for himself and his family and to return home rich.  Then he inadvertently becomes involved in the French resistence.  It's a fascinating story and allegedly based on true people and events.I'm not a big fan of camera work and rarely even notice it and never comment on it.  But I have to say that it did get my attention here and I loved it.  Neither am I a fan of car chases or shoot outs but this one, instead of making me cringe and withdraw, drew me in.  I particularly wondered at the dawn (or was it dusk) scene at the Seine, where a group of people escaped onto a barge.  It was pure poetry.I have to mention the music, too.  Again, I've never been a fan of Arabic music but this was really enjoyable.  I loved the man who played the Salim, the Arab-Jewish singer.  He was magnetic in his personal style and his vocal intensity.  His presence was an important aesthetic element to the film.In sum...I think I need to change my initial rating from four stars to five.",5,Fascinating and beautiful tale of Arabs in France during WWII,1357776000,"01 10, 2013",2013,1383,"['knew', 'nothing', 'activities', 'group', 'people', 'France', 'WWII', 'was', 'revelatory', 'beginning', 'scenes', 'especially', 'mosque', 'cabaret', 'were', 'wonderful', 'glimpse', 'culture', 'mosque', 'especially', 'was', 'lovely.It', 'mostly', 'character', 'driven', 'story', 'young', 'Algerian', 'immigrant', 'man', 'who', 'profiteering', 'selling', 'goods', 'black', 'market', 'soley', 'make', 'money', 'family', 'return', 'home', 'rich', 'Then', 'inadvertently', 'involved', 'French', 'resistence', 'fascinating', 'story', 'allegedly', 'based', 'true', 'people', 'events.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'camera', 'work', 'rarely', 'even', 'notice', 'never', 'comment', 'have', 'say', 'did', 'get', 'attention', 'here', 'loved', 'am', 'fan', 'car', 'chases', 'shoot', 'outs', 'one', 'instead', 'making', 'cringe', 'withdraw', 'drew', 'particularly', 'wondered', 'dawn', 'was', 'dusk', 'scene', 'Seine', 'where', 'group', 'people', 'escaped', 'barge', 'was', 'pure', 'poetry.I', 'have', 'mention', 'music', 'too', 'Again', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'Arabic', 'music', 'was', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'loved', 'man', 'who', 'played', 'Salim', 'Arab-Jewish', 'singer', 'was', 'magnetic', 'personal', 'style', 'vocal', 'intensity', 'presence', 'was', 'important', 'aesthetic', 'element', 'film.In', 'sum', 'think', 'need', 'change', 'initial', 'rating', 'four', 'stars', 'five']",Free Men

He gets caught by the collaborationist French Gendarmes and in return for not being jailed (or worse) is told he has to spy on the Paris Mosque. The authorities believe it is being used as a centre to protect `undesirables' and for giving out false documents to aid people fleeing the Nazi rule. At the mosque he meets a talented Arabic singer Salim Halali (Mahumud Shalaby), and Younes is moved by his singing and forceful personality so starts to view his world with very differently.He also gets involved in helping those he had once lived off /exploited, as he becomes more aware of the plight of those who are being persecuted, he turns from being a self centred, money making merchant into a committed `freedom fighter'. The mosque is central to the whole thing and the leader there is played by Michael Lonsdale (`Of Gods and Men' and `Ronin') who as ever delivers an impeccable performance.This film shows a remarkable part of history where the Muslims helped Jews escape the Nazi tyranny and as such should be praised for highlighting such a story, but it has got some critics, despite doing rather well on `Rotten Tomatoes' there are still some valid criticisms, one being the lack of tension. That could be because a lot of what takes place is ordinary every day life at the mosque, or the little on screen time of the Nazis and their ally Gendarmes'. This is much more character driven than action and that too could explain it being called `shapeless and sluggish- (The Daily Telegraph). I thought it was a quietly moving story that was directed extremely well by Ismal Ferroukhi. The sets are all wonderful and full of colour especially the Mosque; some of the German uniforms I felt were a bit ropey but that is a minor gripe.Overall this is one for those who like a bit of art in their films and is in French with fairly good sub titles, a quick search showed that a lot of what is featured in the film did actually take place, and is something I knew nothing at all about, not for action fans and not a real `war' movie for purists but a commendable effort all the same.",4,Muslims save Jews in this French War time Drama,1348790400,"09 28, 2012",2012,2226,"['story', 'Younes', 'Tahir', 'Rahim', 'Prophet', 'small', 'time', 'Algerian', 'black', 'marketer', 'German', 'occupied', 'Paris', 'circa', '1942', 'caught', 'collaborationist', 'French', 'Gendarmes', 'return', 'not', 'being', 'jailed', 'worse', 'told', 'spy', 'Paris', 'Mosque', 'authorities', 'believe', 'being', 'used', 'centre', 'protect', 'undesirables', 'giving', 'out', 'false', 'documents', 'aid', 'people', 'fleeing', 'Nazi', 'rule', 'mosque', 'talented', 'Arabic', 'singer', 'Salim', 'Halali', 'Mahumud', 'Shalaby', 'Younes', 'moved', 'singing', 'forceful', 'personality', 'so', 'view', 'world', 'very', 'differently.He', 'also', 'involved', 'helping', 'had', 'once', 'lived', 'off', '/exploited', 'more', 'aware', 'plight', 'who', 'are', 'being', 'persecuted', 'being', 'self', 'centred', 'money', 'making', 'merchant', 'committed', 'freedom', 'fighter', 'mosque', 'central', 'whole', 'thing', 'leader', 'played', 'Michael', 'Lonsdale', 'Gods', 'Men', 'Ronin', 'who', 'ever', 'impeccable', 'performance.This', 'film', 'remarkable', 'part', 'history', 'where', 'Muslims', 'helped', 'Jews', 'escape', 'Nazi', 'tyranny', 'such', 'should', 'be', 'praised', 'highlighting', 'story', 'got', 'critics', 'doing', 'rather', 'well', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'are', 'still', 'valid', 'criticisms', 'one', 'being', 'lack', 'tension', 'could', 'be', 'lot', 'what', 'place', 'ordinary', 'day', 'life', 'mosque', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'Nazis', 'ally', 'Gendarmes', 'much', 'more', 'character', 'driven', 'action', 'too', 'could', 'explain', 'being', 'called', 'shapeless', 'sluggish-', 'Daily', 'Telegraph', 'thought', 'was', 'quietly', 'moving', 'story', 'was', 'directed', 'extremely', 'well', 'Ismal', 'Ferroukhi', 'sets', 'are', 'wonderful', 'full', 'colour', 'especially', 'Mosque', 'German', 'uniforms', 'felt', 'were', 'bit', 'ropey', 'minor', 'gripe.Overall', 'one', 'who', 'like', 'bit', 'art', 'films', 'French', 'fairly', 'good', 'sub', 'titles', 'quick', 'search', 'showed', 'lot', 'what', 'featured', 'film', 'did', 'actually', 'take', 'place', 'something', 'knew', 'nothing', 'about', 'not', 'action', 'fans', 'not', 'real', 'war', 'movie', 'purists', 'commendable', 'effort', 'same']",Free Men
