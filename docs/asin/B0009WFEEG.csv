914495,ADS5APY1NKTL4,B0009WFEEG,,"[1, 1]","WILL & GRACE didn't leave much to the imagination, during the course of their fourth season.  In fact, there is something juicy, here, for just about every character.  As an example, Jack McFarland (Sean Hayes), who we know best as the opportunistic and childlike best friend of Will (Eric McCormack) has a son, Elliott (Michael Angarano), from his stint as a sperm donor.  In an effort to bond with Elliott, Jack spends time with him and introduces the boy to his world, as well as trying to relate to the pre-teen in his own world.  Grace (Debra Messing) is still involved with her upstairs neighbor (Woody Harrelson), if but for a brief time.  Karen (Megan Mullally), Grace's perpetually pill popping/drunk ""assistant,"" runs into some legal trouble with her often spoke of, but never seen, husband, Stan.  Will (Eric McCormack)'s father is Sidney Pollack, in a hilarious, recurring role.  Need I say more?  There are many other celebrity guest stars, as well, like Lesley Ann Warren and Parker Posey, in a hilarious turn as Jack's bitchy manager at his sweater folding job at the mall.  This is a great season, folks.

914498,A130YN8T37O833,B0009WFEEG,"Always Samsung ""ravereviews""","[1, 4]","If you didn't feel the magic disappear at the start of season 4 you'll really FEEL IT NOW by the time you finish this season! Will & Grace was always a great show from the beginning and pure magic from seasons 1 - 3. But when season 4 started with Woody Harrelson as Grace's love interest the chemistry and magic between all the lead characters seem to disappear over night. Will & Grace never really had the FUNNY CRAZY lines but they worked well with what they were given. Instead all the good lines were given to Jack & Karen. Pretty much in my opinion for the shows 8 year run it's always secretly been called the Jack & Karen show. Anyways at this point since Will & Grace weren't even given any decent lines, the below average lines that were given they had to turn humorous which just came off really desperate and made the 2 characters even more annoying then they originally were. The show from this point just doesn't have any element to keep you tuning in each week and starts to decline quite gradually. Every episode of this season is almost a pain to watch. You try and look forward to the next laugh and all you get are bad jokes with bad a delivery from the actors and a lot of empty spaces in-between when waiting for the next joke. Every episode you could already tell this show was on its last legs. It wasn't about making people laugh anymore. It was more about learning a life lesson at the end of each episode. When a show starts to become learning about Life Lessons that's when it becomes like the Family Matters sitcom and SLOW torture. I was in shock that this show went on for 8 years. When the show 1st started and after an amazing season 3 I always thought this show would last longer then the over rated Friends sitcom. I also asked myself how are they gonna top the AMAZING 3rd season. But after season 4 it was time to hang up the hat and call it a day. As i mentioned it was always about Jack & Karen and the writers or producers really OVER USED the 2 characters to do crazy things and in all honesty i think the actors PASSION for doing the show started to dwindle. There comes a point in everyone's job if you're in the same position for years where you feel like you know what you're doing and that you've MASTERED the art of IT and nothing is a challenge anymore. That situation applies here and you can really feel that with the cast of Will & Grace. Despite that my review maybe coming off negative i do like all of the 4 main actors and this is Will & Grace so i rated it with a 4 star even though i wanted it to be 3 1/2. But because its Will & Grace i still give it a chance. Bare this in mind, the CAST became so GREAT at their CRAFT that they became INVALUABLE.",4,WOW!!! ....and that's NOT a GOOD THING!!!,1202688000,"02 11, 2008",2008,2706,"['did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'magic', 'disappear', 'start', 'season', '4', ""'ll"", 'really', 'FEEL', 'IT', 'NOW', 'time', 'finish', 'season', 'Will', 'Grace', 'was', 'always', 'great', 'show', 'beginning', 'pure', 'magic', 'seasons', '1', '3', 'when', 'season', '4', 'started', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Grace', 'love', 'interest', 'chemistry', 'magic', 'lead', 'characters', 'seem', 'disappear', 'over', 'night', 'Will', 'Grace', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'FUNNY', 'CRAZY', 'lines', 'worked', 'well', 'what', 'were', 'given', 'Instead', 'good', 'lines', 'were', 'given', 'Jack', 'Karen', 'Pretty', 'much', 'opinion', 'shows', '8', 'year', 'run', 'always', 'secretly', 'been', 'called', 'Jack', 'Karen', 'show', 'point', 'Will', 'Grace', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'given', 'decent', 'lines', 'below', 'average', 'lines', 'were', 'given', 'had', 'turn', 'humorous', 'just', 'came', 'off', 'really', 'desperate', 'made', '2', 'characters', 'even', 'more', 'annoying', 'then', 'originally', 'were', 'show', 'point', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'element', 'keep', 'tuning', 'week', 'decline', 'quite', 'gradually', 'Every', 'episode', 'season', 'almost', 'pain', 'watch', 'try', 'look', 'forward', 'next', 'laugh', 'get', 'are', 'bad', 'jokes', 'bad', 'delivery', 'actors', 'lot', 'empty', 'spaces', 'in-between', 'when', 'waiting', 'next', 'joke', 'episode', 'could', 'already', 'tell', 'show', 'was', 'last', 'legs', 'was', ""n't"", 'making', 'people', 'anymore', 'was', 'more', 'learning', 'life', 'lesson', 'end', 'episode', 'When', 'show', 'become', 'learning', 'Life', 'Lessons', 'when', 'Family', 'Matters', 'sitcom', 'SLOW', 'torture', 'was', 'shock', 'show', 'went', '8', 'years', 'When', 'show', '1st', 'started', 'amazing', 'season', '3', 'always', 'thought', 'show', 'would', 'last', 'longer', 'then', 'over', 'rated', 'Friends', 'sitcom', 'also', 'asked', 'how', 'are', 'gon', 'top', 'AMAZING', '3rd', 'season', 'season', '4', 'was', 'time', 'hang', 'up', 'hat', 'call', 'day', 'i', 'mentioned', 'was', 'always', 'Jack', 'Karen', 'writers', 'producers', 'really', 'OVER', 'USED', '2', 'characters', 'do', 'crazy', 'things', 'honesty', 'i', 'think', 'actors', 'PASSION', 'doing', 'show', 'started', 'dwindle', 'point', 'everyone', 'job', ""'re"", 'same', 'position', 'years', 'where', 'feel', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', ""'ve"", 'MASTERED', 'art', 'IT', 'nothing', 'challenge', 'anymore', 'situation', 'here', 'can', 'really', 'feel', 'cast', 'Will', 'Grace', 'review', 'maybe', 'coming', 'off', 'negative', 'i', 'do', '4', 'main', 'actors', 'Will', 'Grace', 'i', 'rated', '4', 'star', 'even', 'i', 'wanted', 'be', '3', '1/2', 'Will', 'Grace', 'i', 'still', 'give', 'chance', 'Bare', 'mind', 'CAST', 'became', 'so', 'GREAT', 'CRAFT', 'became', 'INVALUABLE']",Will & Grace - Season Four

914503,A6P73HMHDW5W3,B0009WFEEG,David Solomon,"[4, 8]","This season marked the end of my interest in ""Will & Grace."" During these episodes, the show really veers away from the original premise, a straight woman living with a homosexual man.The season begins with the continuation of the romance between Grace (Debra Messing) and Nathan (Woody Harrelson). This storyline really started me to dislike the show for two reasons: 1) Any boyfriend broke up the great comedic chemistry between Will (Eric McCormack) and Grace; 2) Woody Harrelson's character was altered from the one he portrayed at the end of Season 3 to make him a more believable romantic interest for Grace.This season also marks the complete transformation of Jack and Karen from hilariously quirky to unlikeably mean.The real lowlight of this series is the Glenn Close episode, in which she plays a coked-up photographer. This episode ranks as the worst and most embarassing guest shot in TV history and leads into the incredibly dumb storyline about Will and Grace trying to have a baby that finally caused me to stop watching this show.However, the episode with Ms. Close's ""Fatal Attraction"" co-star, Michael Douglas, is absolutely hilarious. Matt Damon is also very funny as a heterosexual acting gay to be in Jack's choir.But aside from these episodes, by Season 4, ""Will & Grace"" was really more of the same jokes that everyone now knew were coming and storylines that distorted the characters we came to like in Seasons 1 to 3.",2,The End,1145923200,"04 25, 2006",2006,1443,"['season', 'marked', 'end', 'interest', 'Will', 'Grace', 'episodes', 'show', 'really', 'away', 'original', 'premise', 'straight', 'woman', 'living', 'homosexual', 'man.The', 'season', 'continuation', 'romance', 'Grace', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'Nathan', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'storyline', 'really', 'started', 'dislike', 'show', 'two', 'reasons', '1', 'boyfriend', 'broke', 'up', 'great', 'comedic', 'chemistry', 'Will', 'Eric', 'McCormack', 'Grace', '2', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'character', 'was', 'altered', 'one', 'portrayed', 'end', 'Season', '3', 'make', 'more', 'believable', 'romantic', 'interest', 'Grace.This', 'season', 'also', 'complete', 'transformation', 'Jack', 'Karen', 'hilariously', 'quirky', 'unlikeably', 'mean.The', 'real', 'lowlight', 'series', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'episode', 'coked-up', 'photographer', 'episode', 'ranks', 'worst', 'most', 'embarassing', 'guest', 'shot', 'TV', 'history', 'incredibly', 'dumb', 'storyline', 'Will', 'Grace', 'trying', 'have', 'baby', 'finally', 'caused', 'stop', 'watching', 'show.However', 'episode', 'Ms.', 'Close', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'co-star', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'heterosexual', 'acting', 'gay', 'be', 'Jack', 'choir.But', 'aside', 'episodes', 'Season', '4', 'Will', 'Grace', 'was', 'really', 'more', 'same', 'jokes', 'everyone', 'now', 'were', 'coming', 'storylines', 'distorted', 'characters', 'came', 'like', 'Seasons', '1', '3']",Will & Grace - Season Four

914514,AMG2LF8MLUDN1,B0009WFEEG,M. Fields,"[3, 3]","I only discovered Will & Grace in reruns.  It's one of the funniest shows on air right now.  For those of you who think that the premise is unbelievable, it's not.  I've had a best friend who was gay and a lot of the dynamics from the show are true to life.  I know having gone through some if it.Will and Grace are best friends but Will is a gay man and Grace is a heterosexual female.  They remain friends no matter what happens even though they do fight and walk away from each other for awhile.  They always get back together.  Jack and Karen are the friends that makeup the foursome.  In Jack's case though he's more leach than friend.  He never keeps a job for long, always wants a handout and fancies himself a great want to be actor, dancer and singer.  Jack is gay and flamboyant which drives Will nuts because while he is gay he is not outrageously so nor is he effeminant.  Karen is filthy rich.  She's a pill popping, boozing, abuse giving, well dressed woman who thinks that other folks were created to serve her every desire.Kudos to the casting deparment.  Each member of the foursome creates their character accurately.  Normally in tv land, it might take two or three seasons before the players really nail their characters down but the cast of Will and Grace did it in half a season.  By the middle of season one, the Karen character had found her niche with the high pitched nasal voice and her sarcastic laugh.  All play off of each other very well.  In fact I find Megan's (Karen) real voice much more annoying than her false one.  All in all I have to say that I am putting this show in my personal list of all time funny shows (All in the Family, Mash, Night Court, Frazier, Absolutely Fabulous) with AITF in the lead of course.I do wish the studio would get it together and release season five already.
