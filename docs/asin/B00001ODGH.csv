Her songs have been polished to a jewel-like finish, and every nuance of phrasing is right on. I can't  understand the quibbling with the editing.

Note to directors and editors:  These are concerts - we the viewers have longer attention spans than your typical 3 minute music video requires.

511029,A1OZFMJ2AD2R41,B00001ODGH,Furiae,"[8, 8]","Yes, the images aren't paper-cut sharp, but in my opinion, it's not a big issue.  I've viewed it on my 17"" computer monitor and my 27"" TV and have never felt it was a problem.  I actually enjoy it being the way it is, as I feel it adds a certain flavor to the concert, a certain mystique that's very Sarah.I've read from other reviews that some people had issues with the sound quality and audio synching.  I'll address both in order.  First, sound quality.  I actually found the sound very rich and enjoyable.  To my ears, the music was pretty on par with the quality of the CD release of Mirrorball... but if you want die-hard CD quality, play the CD, I say.  Next, audio synching.  I had no problems with that on my DVD player and computer, but I had a friend who complained the audio synching was off on her DVD.  After she upgraded her DVD player (she had previously been playing it on a rather ancient machine), she says the concert has been playing well ever since, so we're suspecting the problem may be with DVD players and not the DVD itself.Mirrorball is rich, dynamic, and above all, simplistic.  I love Sarah's style and it shows on the concert.  She walks around barefoot and doesn't once undergo a costume change.  The only effects are the lighting effects.  In essence, it's all about the music.  Her showmanship shines and in every act, Sarah commands the stage.  Simply put, every performance just gels together wonderfully to produce a fluid concert.  Each atmosphere is simplistic, dark, a little moody, yet vibrant and lively, and striking- just like Sarah's music.  She compromises nothing in this concert and everybody, including the band, seems absolutely at ease on the stage.All in all, this concert epitomizes ""just enough to make it perfect.""  It isn't overdone and it isn't underdone.The way each song is executed is absolute perfection.  In many cases with concerts, something goes missing.  This seems to be the case with many pop artists whose rise to fame rests upon commercialized ""canned"" music, those artists who rely on studio magic to make their songs good.  If you take away the glitz, glam, special effects, and outrageous costumes, the concerts would only be ""ok"" at best.  Usually, there's a horrible gap in music quality between concerts and CDs.  You'll find none of that on Mirrorball.  I was surprised to find that Sarah is really that good, as good on stage as she is in the studio.On many of Sarah's songs, she creates music magic by overlapping vocals to create a more ethereal sound.  I was wondering how she'd duplicate that on stage, but her backup singer, Camille Henderson, is splendid.  Sometimes, the drummer backs up the sound, and I was surprised how just one or two more singers in the background could mesh with Sarah's sound so flawlessly.I think one of the things I found most enjoyable with this recording is how Sarah keeps the energy going by staying ""into"" the music.  She moves around and grooves with the music, and I found myself entraced with her more so than watching other artists performing an extravagant dance number.  That says a lot when one lady up on stage can keep you entranced with only a microphone in her hand, compared to other recording artists who need a choreographed dance number, an entourage of backup dancers to sell their concerts, and thousand dollar effects.Mirrorball was absolutely enchanting.  Sarah is penetrating and mesmerizing.  The entire ensemble that backed her up also deserves kudos for their performances.  The set up and concept were simple.  The music was truly what mattered and what took center stage on this recording, and it blew me away.  I own concert DVDs of the Corrs, Kylie Minogue, Britney Spears, Sarah Brightman, Charlotte Church, and Josh Groban, but this concert is the one that constantly makes its way back into my DVD player most often.This was a very well done recording completely befitting of a beautiful artist.",5,absolutely enchanting,1049068800,"03 31, 2003",2003,3942,"['Yes', 'images', 'are', ""n't"", 'paper-cut', 'sharp', 'opinion', 'not', 'big', 'issue', ""'ve"", 'viewed', '17', 'computer', 'monitor', '27', 'TV', 'have', 'never', 'felt', 'was', 'problem', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'being', 'way', 'feel', 'certain', 'flavor', 'concert', 'certain', 'mystique', 'very', 'Sarah.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'people', 'had', 'issues', 'sound', 'quality', 'audio', 'synching', ""'ll"", 'address', 'order', 'First', 'sound', 'quality', 'actually', 'found', 'sound', 'very', 'rich', 'enjoyable', 'ears', 'music', 'was', 'pretty', 'par', 'quality', 'CD', 'release', 'Mirrorball', 'want', 'die-hard', 'CD', 'quality', 'play', 'CD', 'say', 'Next', 'audio', 'synching', 'had', 'problems', 'DVD', 'player', 'computer', 'had', 'friend', 'who', 'complained', 'audio', 'synching', 'was', 'off', 'DVD', 'upgraded', 'DVD', 'player', 'had', 'previously', 'been', 'playing', 'rather', 'ancient', 'machine', 'concert', 'been', 'playing', 'well', 'ever', ""'re"", 'suspecting', 'problem', 'may', 'be', 'DVD', 'players', 'not', 'DVD', 'itself.Mirrorball', 'rich', 'dynamic', 'simplistic', 'love', 'Sarah', 'style', 'concert', 'barefoot', ""n't"", 'once', 'undergo', 'costume', 'change', 'only', 'effects', 'are', 'lighting', 'effects', 'essence', 'music', 'showmanship', 'shines', 'act', 'Sarah', 'stage', 'Simply', 'put', 'performance', 'just', 'gels', 'together', 'wonderfully', 'produce', 'fluid', 'concert', 'atmosphere', 'simplistic', 'dark', 'little', 'moody', 'vibrant', 'lively', 'striking-', 'just', 'Sarah', 'music', 'nothing', 'concert', 'everybody', 'including', 'band', 'absolutely', 'ease', 'stage.All', 'concert', 'just', 'enough', 'make', 'perfect', ""n't"", 'overdone', ""n't"", 'underdone.The', 'way', 'song', 'executed', 'absolute', 'perfection', 'many', 'cases', 'concerts', 'something', 'missing', 'be', 'case', 'many', 'pop', 'artists', 'rise', 'fame', 'rests', 'commercialized', 'canned', 'music', 'artists', 'who', 'rely', 'studio', 'magic', 'make', 'songs', 'good', 'take', 'away', 'glitz', 'glam', 'special', 'effects', 'outrageous', 'costumes', 'concerts', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'ok', 'best', 'Usually', 'horrible', 'gap', 'music', 'quality', 'concerts', 'CDs', ""'ll"", 'find', 'none', 'Mirrorball', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'Sarah', 'really', 'good', 'good', 'stage', 'studio.On', 'many', 'Sarah', 'songs', 'music', 'magic', 'overlapping', 'vocals', 'create', 'more', 'ethereal', 'sound', 'was', 'wondering', 'how', ""'d"", 'duplicate', 'stage', 'backup', 'singer', 'Camille', 'Henderson', 'splendid', 'Sometimes', 'drummer', 'up', 'sound', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'just', 'one', 'two', 'more', 'singers', 'background', 'could', 'mesh', 'Sarah', 'sound', 'so', 'flawlessly.I', 'think', 'one', 'things', 'found', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'recording', 'how', 'Sarah', 'energy', 'going', 'staying', 'music', 'around', 'music', 'found', 'entraced', 'more', 'so', 'watching', 'other', 'artists', 'performing', 'extravagant', 'dance', 'number', 'lot', 'when', 'one', 'lady', 'up', 'stage', 'can', 'keep', 'entranced', 'only', 'microphone', 'hand', 'compared', 'other', 'recording', 'artists', 'who', 'need', 'choreographed', 'dance', 'number', 'entourage', 'backup', 'dancers', 'sell', 'concerts', 'thousand', 'dollar', 'effects.Mirrorball', 'was', 'absolutely', 'enchanting', 'Sarah', 'penetrating', 'mesmerizing', 'entire', 'ensemble', 'backed', 'up', 'also', 'kudos', 'performances', 'set', 'up', 'concept', 'were', 'simple', 'music', 'was', 'truly', 'what', 'mattered', 'what', 'took', 'center', 'stage', 'recording', 'blew', 'away', 'own', 'concert', 'DVDs', 'Corrs', 'Kylie', 'Minogue', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'Charlotte', 'Church', 'Josh', 'Groban', 'concert', 'one', 'constantly', 'way', 'back', 'DVD', 'player', 'most', 'often.This', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'recording', 'completely', 'befitting', 'beautiful', 'artist']",Sarah McLachlan - Mirrorball

At first glance, one would probably be tempted to give a lower rating - hey, for all intents and purposes it's just a concert  video right?  And no spectacular fireworks display, biting heads off of  chickens or anything at that!  So why the high praise?Firstly, it's the  fact that Sarah Mc Lachlan was able to create an emotionally stirring  atmosphere amidst a &quot;simple&quot; concert stage backdrop.  Her songs  come out crisp and clear (5.1 helps a lot of course!), and the choice /  changing of camera angles and views was perfect - no glare or anything  (compare this with, say, Belinda Carlisle's Runaway Live DVD and you'll  know what I mean). Simple, yes, but it was &quot;near-perfect&quot;  simplicity nevertheless.Also, I personally liked the live versions of  certain cuts better than the standard ones.  &quot;Hold On&quot; and  &quot;Fear&quot; in particular, more, well, &quot;upbeat&quot;.

Sarah and her band are in top form, as they cover practically the full range of her work. I can't think of a single song you'd want to hear in a Sarah McLachlan live concert that isn't on this disc. And that's the real selling point for this DVD. The DVD version of Mirrorball features some 23 songs - 9 more than the original CD!
