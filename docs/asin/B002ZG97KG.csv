I'm a fan of many types of movies, but the ones that touch my heart are in a category all their own. This type of film - where good narration is given equal importance to the visual elements - is one of my favorite kind of ""feel good"" movies. It's like being able to literally see situations - in vivid detail - as you're reading a great novel. It reminded me of ""Second Hand Lions,"" ""A Christmas Story"" and ""Big Fish"" from that respect.I loved television shows like ""The Wonder Years"" and ""My So-called Life."" This story has that same multi-faceted view of the broad spectrum of people who have an effect on the main characters and enables you to see the situations that lead to the ultimate outcome. It makes you realize how almost anything in life could have turned out differently if everyone were able to see the big picture.",5,WATCH THIS MOVIE!,1290470400,"11 23, 2010",2010,875,"['sincerely', 'hope', 'will', 'become', 'classic', ""'m"", 'fan', 'many', 'types', 'movies', 'ones', 'touch', 'heart', 'are', 'category', 'own', 'type', 'film', 'where', 'good', 'narration', 'given', 'equal', 'importance', 'visual', 'elements', 'one', 'favorite', 'kind', 'feel', 'good', 'movies', 'being', 'able', 'literally', 'see', 'situations', 'vivid', 'detail', ""'re"", 'reading', 'great', 'novel', 'reminded', 'Second', 'Hand', 'Lions', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'Big', 'Fish', 'respect.I', 'loved', 'television', 'shows', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'So-called', 'Life', 'story', 'same', 'multi-faceted', 'view', 'broad', 'spectrum', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'effect', 'main', 'characters', 'enables', 'see', 'situations', 'lead', 'ultimate', 'outcome', 'realize', 'how', 'almost', 'anything', 'life', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'differently', 'everyone', 'were', 'able', 'see', 'big', 'picture']",N/A
1302996,A34BUK6Q132V75,B002ZG97KG,Agnes,"[1, 1]","I read Wendelin Van Draanen's book when it first came out and loved it.  Quite a while later, some amazing person got the lovely idea to take that book and make it into a movie (something which surprised me because Flipped was one of those overlooked, not-so-well known stories that was quickly overshadowed by other things) and the result is not only enjoyable but, unlike most book to movie adaptations, it actually does the book justice.Flipped follows the relationship of two teenagers, Julie and Bryce, neighbors (across the street neighbors) and frenemies (friends who are sometimes enemies and vice versa, apologies for the lingo) and whose relationship is mapped from its earliest beginnings to its present status in the movie.  Love struck after getting a gander at Bryce's blue eyes, Julie knows that he holds her first kiss.  What follows is her pursuit, Bryce's embarrassment, a twist in perception (the viewer gets to see both sides of this tale, just as in the book), and this makes for an enjoyable movie.This movie is a good example of a book to movie adaption done well.  Not only this but it is not something that just kids would enjoy.  In fact, I wonder if adults might enjoy it just as much if not more than children, despite how simple the plot sounds.  (A side note: everyone in my family who watched this loved it)  I liked this movie very much.  The boy and girl who play the main characters do an okay job, though I was (admittedly) a little disappointed.  It was also a treat to see Aidan Quinn as Julie's father.  The movie does skip around in time, jumping from past to present and between the two main characters, which was also done in the book.  Some people may find this confusing; I did not.I can readily point out some more pluses: there are some nice lessons on the uprightness of one's character, on looking deeper than the surface, and...(this one's big) I loved the music.  I knew every song and loved every single one.  This is (again) a great adaptation of a book I really enjoyed a long time ago.  Unfortunately, it seems that it has not been widely viewed, though I think it deserves a try.  For those interested, I'm not guaranteeing that you will like it, but it does come recommended.",4,Faithful adaptation of the book makes an enjoyable watch,1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,2230,"['read', 'Wendelin', 'Van', 'Draanen', 'book', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'loved', 'while', 'later', 'amazing', 'person', 'got', 'lovely', 'idea', 'take', 'book', 'make', 'movie', 'something', 'surprised', 'Flipped', 'was', 'one', 'overlooked', 'not-so-well', 'known', 'stories', 'was', 'quickly', 'overshadowed', 'other', 'things', 'result', 'not', 'only', 'enjoyable', 'most', 'book', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'actually', 'book', 'justice.Flipped', 'relationship', 'two', 'teenagers', 'Julie', 'Bryce', 'neighbors', 'street', 'neighbors', 'frenemies', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'sometimes', 'enemies', 'vice', 'versa', 'apologies', 'lingo', 'relationship', 'mapped', 'earliest', 'beginnings', 'present', 'status', 'movie', 'Love', 'struck', 'getting', 'gander', 'Bryce', 'blue', 'eyes', 'Julie', 'first', 'kiss', 'What', 'pursuit', 'Bryce', 'embarrassment', 'twist', 'perception', 'viewer', 'see', 'sides', 'tale', 'just', 'book', 'enjoyable', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'good', 'example', 'book', 'movie', 'adaption', 'done', 'well', 'Not', 'only', 'not', 'something', 'just', 'kids', 'would', 'enjoy', 'fact', 'wonder', 'adults', 'might', 'enjoy', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'not', 'more', 'children', 'how', 'simple', 'plot', 'side', 'note', 'everyone', 'family', 'who', 'watched', 'loved', 'liked', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'boy', 'girl', 'who', 'play', 'main', 'characters', 'do', 'okay', 'job', 'was', 'admittedly', 'little', 'disappointed', 'was', 'also', 'treat', 'see', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'Julie', 'father', 'movie', 'skip', 'time', 'jumping', 'past', 'present', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'was', 'also', 'done', 'book', 'people', 'may', 'find', 'confusing', 'did', 'not.I', 'can', 'readily', 'point', 'out', 'more', 'pluses', 'are', 'nice', 'lessons', 'uprightness', 'one', 'character', 'looking', 'deeper', 'surface', 'one', 'big', 'loved', 'music', 'knew', 'song', 'loved', 'single', 'one', 'again', 'great', 'adaptation', 'book', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'been', 'widely', 'viewed', 'think', 'try', 'interested', ""'m"", 'not', 'guaranteeing', 'will', 'like', 'come', 'recommended']",N/A

However, it takes the viewer through the lives of 2 young people as they interact with their school friends and each other from elementary to high school in the 1960's and presents the events from both perspectives. It demonstrates how we can, and often do, jump to erroneous conclusions based only upon what we see circumstantially.The only negative I found with the movie was the inclusion of a few swear words that I felt were uncalled for; the film did not need them to provide realism.

I looked forward to seeing each POV even if we did the whole scene over again.The movie was set in the 1960s and I guess the novel wasn't... but I liked it. There were so many behaviors that seemed so 1960s, ie. Bryce is so mannered. Feels badly when he is mean to Julie before he even likes her. I suppose it gives me hope that a modern story could be taken to the 1960s.And what a cast! When I got to my destination and saw this movie was a 2010 movie I couldn't believe it.

1303004,A30TQET02FLSUX,B002ZG97KG,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[3, 7]","FILM RATING:  3 starsWriter/Director Rob Reiner's most recent addition to the world of cinema is Flipped (2010), a super sweet, PG-rated, coming-of-age movie set in the early 1960's. It's basically a simple story about first love between two tweens. I had no intention of watching this flick initially, but then heard some mixed reviews on a few film podcasts, with both really negative and really positive remarks. So when Flipped debuted on HBO in HD this week, I recorded it to my DVR and checked it out. And I was pleasantly surprised that the movie wasn't too Disney or Lifetime for me, being rated so light. While it isn't a movie I'll watch again anytime soon, I give props to Reiner for putting together a sort of ""lite"" version of Stand By Me (1986) for the younger set. It's got heart and its intentions are in the right place. This story isn't about a group of boyhood friends, like the classic Stand By Me, but instead about girl-boy friendship and early love.The young stars of this film, played by Madeline Carroll and Callan McAuliffe, do a fine job of providing solid believable performances. The same can be said for the entire supporting cast, which includes Rebecca De Mornay, Anthony Edwards, John Mahoney, Aidan Quinn, and Penelope Ann Miller. Reiner assembled a pretty well known cast of older actors, who don't seem to be headlining more significant projects, but put their acting chops to work here. Together, the cast helps tell this short 90-minute story without going too over-the-top.One of the standout features of the film is the warm, saturated and beautiful cinematography by Thomas Del Ruth, who also worked with Reiner on Stand By Me. Del Ruth has an eye for good lighting and composition in his photography. I really appreciated what he did here because without his work, this film could've devolved into a Special of the Week TV movie. But Del Ruth gives the film a marked cinematic feel. The production design on the film by Bill Brzeski was also well done. I never questioned being set in the 60's while watching the film. Every little detail in the sets, locations, props, costumes, and makeup were spot on. While the sound design and music for the film didn't stand out for me, the sound was solid and did its job.If you're looking for a family friendly flick or something to just escape into for an afternoon, Flipped isn't a bad choice. It reminds you to not always judge a book by its cover.",3,Surprisingly Decent from Rob Reiner...but no Stand By Me,1310688000,"07 15, 2011",2011,2434,"['FILM', 'RATING', '3', 'starsWriter/Director', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'most', 'recent', 'addition', 'world', 'cinema', 'Flipped', '2010', 'super', 'sweet', 'PG-rated', 'coming-of-age', 'movie', 'set', 'early', '1960', 'basically', 'simple', 'story', 'first', 'love', 'two', 'tweens', 'had', 'intention', 'watching', 'flick', 'initially', 'then', 'heard', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'few', 'film', 'podcasts', 'really', 'negative', 'really', 'positive', 'remarks', 'So', 'when', 'Flipped', 'debuted', 'HBO', 'HD', 'week', 'recorded', 'DVR', 'checked', 'out', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'Disney', 'Lifetime', 'being', 'rated', 'so', 'light', ""n't"", 'movie', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'again', 'anytime', 'soon', 'give', 'props', 'Reiner', 'putting', 'together', 'sort', 'lite', 'version', 'Stand', 'Me', '1986', 'younger', 'set', 'got', 'heart', 'intentions', 'are', 'right', 'place', 'story', ""n't"", 'group', 'boyhood', 'friends', 'classic', 'Stand', 'Me', 'instead', 'girl-boy', 'friendship', 'early', 'love.The', 'young', 'stars', 'film', 'played', 'Madeline', 'Carroll', 'Callan', 'McAuliffe', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'providing', 'solid', 'believable', 'performances', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'entire', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Rebecca', 'De', 'Mornay', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'John', 'Mahoney', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'Penelope', 'Ann', 'Miller', 'Reiner', 'assembled', 'pretty', 'well', 'known', 'cast', 'older', 'actors', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'headlining', 'more', 'significant', 'projects', 'put', 'acting', 'chops', 'work', 'here', 'Together', 'cast', 'tell', 'short', '90-minute', 'story', 'going', 'too', 'over-the-top.One', 'standout', 'features', 'film', 'warm', 'saturated', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'Thomas', 'Del', 'Ruth', 'who', 'also', 'worked', 'Reiner', 'Stand', 'Me', 'Del', 'Ruth', 'eye', 'good', 'lighting', 'composition', 'photography', 'really', 'appreciated', 'what', 'did', 'here', 'work', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'devolved', 'Special', 'Week', 'TV', 'movie', 'Del', 'Ruth', 'film', 'marked', 'cinematic', 'feel', 'production', 'design', 'film', 'Bill', 'Brzeski', 'was', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'never', 'questioned', 'being', 'set', '60', 'watching', 'film', 'little', 'detail', 'sets', 'locations', 'props', 'costumes', 'makeup', 'were', 'spot', 'sound', 'design', 'music', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'stand', 'out', 'sound', 'was', 'solid', 'did', 'job.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'family', 'friendly', 'flick', 'something', 'just', 'escape', 'afternoon', 'Flipped', ""n't"", 'bad', 'choice', 'not', 'always', 'judge', 'book', 'cover']",N/A

1303008,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002ZG97KG,Chris Pandolfi,"[31, 32]","Rob Reiner's ""Flipped,"" based on the novel by Wendelin Van Draanen, is an all-around likeable film, a sweet, nostalgic, and reliable coming of age story about first loves and family dramas. It could even be described as a romantic comedy, even if the leads are really too young to know anything about romance. Do you remember how, as kids, you would talk about how you liked someone, and not just liked them, but REALLY liked them, you know, as more than a friend? That's the kind of innocence this movie brings to mind, which I guess is fitting since it mostly takes place in the early 1960s. The plot is perhaps a bit conventional, but it's also undeniably charming, and it features two strong leads who, although young, competently navigate their way through the screenplay, even when it falls victim to sentimental contrivances.The story is about a boy named Bryce Loski and a girl named Julianna Baker, who first met in 1957 when they were only seven years old. Julianna, or Juli (Morgan Lily), bursting with energy and enthusiasm, immediately fell for Bryce (Ryan Ketzner) - or, at the very least, developed what can only be described as a puppy-love crush. Bryce, being only seven, had absolutely no interest in girls, and found her affections frightening. He spent every waking moment trying to avoid her, made impossible by the fact that they live across the street from each other and attended the same school.Flash forward six years to the story proper. A now thirteen-year-old Bryce (Callan McAuliffe) has successfully kept Juli (Madeline Carroll) at a distance, although he keeps bumping into her, and she persists in being outgoing and affectionate. Then things start to change. Juli, who enjoyed climbing a towering sycamore tree and admiring the view, is crushed when developers cut it down, and she feels betrayed when Bryce fails to offer her support. She had been giving Bryce's family boxes of eggs from her own backyard hens, only to discover that Bryce had been throwing them away. Her backyard, he reasons, is filthy and could be breeding salmonella. She angrily tells him that she could have sold those eggs to other neighbors, who have always been willing to pay her for them. Maybe Bryce isn't who she thought he was. Maybe she should just forget about him altogether. The thing is, Bryce is starting to tolerate her. Why, he might even actually LIKE her. He's flipped!She finds solace in Bryce's grandfather, Chet (John Mahoney), who now lives with Bryce and his family. He likes Juli because of her ""iron backbone,"" which reminds him of his recently deceased wife. She, in turn, likes him, probably because he's the only Loski that doesn't look down on her family. In this middle-American, middle class neighborhood, the Bakers are easy targets; her father, a painter (Aidan Quinn), gives every cent he earns to the hospital caring for his mentally retarded brother, David (Kevin Weisman), meaning his wife (Penelope Ann Miller) has to find temporary work just to make ends meet. Bryce's father, Steven (Anthony Edwards), is especially judgmental, although it's for reasons left a little obscure, save for a vague and passing reference to an unfulfilled life.The story is structured as a He-Said, She-Said, Bryce narrating scenes from his point of view before the same scenes are replayed and narrated from Juli's point of view. Not surprisingly, they think along very different lines. Bryce's mind is relentlessly one-tracked, always stuck on how he should avoid Juli, how he should approach Juli, or how he should or apologize to Juli. The one line that's repeated like a mantra is, ""I couldn't stop thinking about Juli."" Perhaps he wouldn't be on this psychological treadmill if he actually bothered to consider her feelings. Compare this with Juli, who's far more introspective. She tries to see people for who they really are and not for how they present themselves. Now that she's a teenager, Bryce is more of an attractive curiosity, a mystery that she wants to solve. But can he be figured out? Or is there truly nothing behind those eyes she loves to look into?While lacking the drama and complexity of Reiner's earlier coming of age period film, ""Stand by Me,"" ""Flipped"" is still a warm, caring, resonant film, taking the conventions of today's romantic comedies and successfully reworking them for a more adolescent audience. The cast is pleasant, especially the young leads. McAuliffe in particular is surprising, at age fifteen already in command of a flawless American accent (he's Australian). That being said, it's doubtful that ""Flipped"" will ever be mentioned in the same sentence as Reiner's most memorable films, including ""This is Spinal Tap,"" ""The Princess Bride,"" ""Misery,"" and ""When Harry Met Sally ..."" Oh, it gets the job done nicely, and it's worth seeing, but don't expect to be quoting lines from it twenty years from now.",4,"He Said, She Said",1281052800,"08 6, 2010",2010,4879,"['Rob', 'Reiner',

The characters feel like real people, and the issues faced are real and believable. But somehow, the final result feels static and more like a TV melodrama. The basic plot is an adolescent love story where two young kids with opposite interests are simultaneously attracted and repelled by each other.  When Juli Baker meets Bryce in the second grade, she is smitten; but Bryce thinks Juli is something of a nerd. Then, in eighth grade, everything changes. Bryce begins to see Juli as kind of cool, but by then Juli starts to think of Bryce as an airhead with no real character. The movie is told in a he-said she-said style with voice-overs where the same scene is often told twice from Juli's and Bryce's opposite points of view. The movie builds towards the suspense of a possible first kiss.If I judge the movie entirely on its merits, I give it a 3. On the other hand, if you are looking for a break from the traditional Hollywood fare, and instead want a simple, family-oriented, feel-good movie to watch on Saturday night I would give it a 4.

She, being a number of years younger, failed to catch my eye at first. And then she grew up!""Flipped"" is Rob Reiner's tale of young Bryce and Juli, who meet on the day Bryce's family moves into the neighborhood. Juli wants to help carry boxes, but as she is rebuffed by Bryce's bitter and sarcastic father, her hand accidentally slips into Bryce's hand--and a spark is kindled. From there, we have the story narrated by both characters, giving us alternate and expanded views of the events that transpire in the years to come. Juli is a smart, independent child. She stands for what she believes, and she is honest at all costs. Bryce wants to fit in, and that means saying what others want to hear, and trying to stay out of the romantic cross-hairs. Everything changes in their eighth-grade year, though, when feelings are flipped. Suddenly, Bryce doesn't know how to act around this girl with flowing hair, even as she decides she is done with the boy with beautiful eyes.It all sounds sweet, and in many ways it is. But what makes this stand out is its refusal to sugarcoat the underlying tensions in these early 1960s families. The cast is full of recognizable faces, but Bryce and Juli stand out as three-dimensional characters. Both have issues they are dealing with, some deeply personal and painful. Aside from a few curse words, the film is suitable for the entire family, yet it delves into some issues such as treatment of the mentally handicapped, dreams that have died, and marital strife.Through it all, Bryce and Juli learn more about each other, themselves, and their family trees.

It should have received much higher review but I can see people sitting in it with judgment blinders.  Here is my view:  First off what was done that I rarely see is how the movie tells it's story from two perspectives.  Not simultaneously, but they tell a section of the story from the perspective of the boy, then gracefully back track and the story then is seen from the perspective of the young girl.  It really is a seamless transition.  It's like giving you a secret view into the another's life and mind.  Beautifully done, as I've seen other films try this but they did not have the same flow and pull as this.This is not quite love-story and in no way is this a sappy movie.  This is a self-realization movie that cause everyone, particularly the girl, to really reexamine why she/we like people--are people beyond or below the measure of their parts.Just to briefly talk about the story:- A young boy is constantly annoyed by his neighbor who has a very strong crush on him.  He can't see her value and she doesn't realize to much later that she is over-valuing him.  The boys grandfather recognizes the girls inner strength and befriends her.

It is funny, uplifting, insightful, and satisfying.The plot involves the relationship of two teenagers; Juli and Bryce - they are the same age but the girl's natural character is far superior to the boy's.  She has loved him since they were seven years old but his only desire it to get away from her.  He thinks he is too good for her, but during seventh grade, his eyes are opened to her true value and to his own petty littleness.  I loved how the story uses Bryce's grandfather as the ""voice of his consiense"" that he cannot escape, and how he slowly rises above the fate of being just as arrogant, nasty and shallow as his Dad is.Juli, in turn begins to see him for the common and cowardly person that he is.  Her growing into freedom from Bryce is a beautiful coming of age story in and of itself.  You can see where she gets her character by the affinity between Juli and her parents, especially her father, who is the very picture of duty, courage and integrity.  People like Juli are few and far between, and those who fail to recognize them are losers in every sense of the word.As this boy learns and grows from his mistakes, he becomes a better person in the course of the lessons learned in his seventh grade year.  It is great that his eyes are opened about her true worth, but one hopes that his growth will continue to make him not just aware of her worth, but that he will actually find enough integrity in his own heart to be eventually worthy of her.  Is his change of heart too late or can she forgive him?  With Julie's influence and his grandfather's fine example, maybe he has a fightning chance!

Early on I thought ""This was clearly written by a woman"" and looked at the DVD box and saw the Rob Reiner screenplay credit.  Not until the credits rolled did I see Wendelin as the author of the original book series.Perhaps girls think this way.  Boys don't, never did.  Not until college.  So the internal dialog, a key feature of the movie, was bogus -- at least for Bryce.  So, am I just nitpicking or is this a worthwhile complaint?Well, it's fiction in the truest sense.  It's about what people wish they were, thinking consciously about vocabulary  and interests.  As kids we don't.  Either something is fun or it's not.  Being mean can be fun.  Character is sensed innately, it matters -- trusting real friends -- but we don't evaluate people based on ""the sum of their parts"" even as adults.  You either like being with someone or you don't.  Liking someone's eyes sounds superficial but actually is deeper than the temporary character evaluations that we hear from the heads of Julie and Bryce.  Courage, other qualities are sensed.  Summing it up, good luck living your life like this, even as an adult: parsing everyone else's talk and behavior.  While it tries to be the opposite, this is actually a very judgmental and inhumane movie.  It reflects some sort of ""ideal man"" (like a soviet era sculpture) instead of sitting around and just being.

1303047,AVBLGXSWRN666,B002ZG97KG,S. Jentsch,"[1, 2]","Flipped is one of those movies that people are going to run across as a home video release, and wonder when it was ever released in theaters. The marketing for this movie was nearly non-existent, and it wasn't in theaters very long. The good thing for movies like this is that the home video market can create a demand that never existed within the theatrical exhibition machine. Hopefully, many people take the time to check out this movie.How Does it Look?The look of this movie is a perfect rendering of what 1963 America looked like, at least according to fictional, idealized accounts. I didn't live through that time, so I can't say for sure, but it sure looks nice! The picture quality of this disc conveys that ideal portrayal well.How Does it Sound?The lossless DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack is mostly front-channel, but that's appropriate for this kind of movie. There aren't many opportunities for the surrounds to show their stuff, so that leaves the front three channels to be done well. Fortunately, the sound mixers did their job and the dialog was always easy to understand. The soundtrack supported this movie very well.ExtrasThere are four featurettes that allow you to spend some extra time with the cast and crew, but don't do all that much for the overall enjoyment of the movie. No trailers are included.There is a DVD version of the movie as well as a Digital Copy. These are nice so that you can enjoy the movie in places that you don't have a Blu-ray player.ConclusionIs it worth purchasing or renting? The four video extras are on the same disc as the movie, so if you rent it, you'll get to see those extras. There's no BD-Live feature that would provide the opportunity for downloadable content in the future, even though to my knowledge, no studio has ever supplied downloadable content after the initial release of the product.Are you going to watch the movie more than once? If so, then go ahead and make the purchase. But otherwise, this might be a rental rather than a purchase. Given the relatively high list price, and the street price of around $26, I don't think it's worth the purchase. A home video release has to earn a purchase, and no matter how much I might have liked the movie, the total package provided here does not justify the price. At $15, you have a winner. At $26, it's a rental.",4,"A treasure waiting to be found, but only at the right price",1297382400,"02 11, 2011",2011,2333,"['Flipped', 'one', 'movies', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'run', 'across', 'home', 'video', 'release', 'wonder', 'when', 'was', 'ever', 'released', 'theaters', 'marketing', 'movie', 'was', 'nearly', 'non-existent', 'was', ""n't"", 'theaters', 'very', 'long', 'good', 'thing', 'movies', 'home', 'video', 'market', 'can', 'create', 'demand', 'never', 'existed', 'theatrical', 'exhibition', 'machine', 'Hopefully', 'many', 'people', 'take', 'time', 'check', 'out', 'movie.How', 'Look', 'look', 'movie', 'perfect', 'rendering', 'what', '1963', 'America', 'looked', 'least', 'according', 'fictional', 'idealized', 'accounts', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'sure', 'sure', 'nice', 'picture', 'quality', 'disc', 'ideal', 'portrayal', 'well.How', 'Sound', 'lossless', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', 'soundtrack', 'mostly', 'front-channel', 'appropriate', 'kind', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'opportunities', 'surrounds', 'show', 'stuff', 'front', 'three', 'channels', 'be', 'done', 'well', 'Fortunately', 'sound', 'mixers', 'did', 'job', 'dialog', 'was', 'always', 'easy', 'understand', 'soundtrack', 'supported', 'movie', 'very', 'well.ExtrasThere', 'are', 'four', 'featurettes', 'allow', 'spend', 'extra', 'time', 'cast', 'crew', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'overall', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'trailers', 'are', 'included.There', 'DVD', 'version', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'are', 'nice', 'so', 'can', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'places', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Blu-ray', 'player.ConclusionIs', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'renting', 'four', 'video', 'extras', 'are', 'same', 'disc', 'movie', 'so', 'rent', ""'ll"", 'get', 'see', 'extras', 'BD-Live', 'feature', 'would', 'provide', 'opportunity', 'downloadable', 'content', 'future', 'even', 'knowledge', 'studio', 'ever', 'supplied', 'downloadable', 'content', 'initial', 'release', 'product.Are', 'going', 'watch', 'movie', 'more', 'once', 'so', 'then', 'go', 'ahead', 'make', 'purchase', 'otherwise', 'might', 'be', 'rental', 'rather', 'purchase', 'Given', 'relatively', 'high', 'list', 'price', 'street', 'price', '26', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'purchase', 'home', 'video', 'release', 'earn', 'purchase', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'might', 'have', 'liked', 'movie', 'total', 'package', 'provided', 'here', 'not', 'justify', 'price', '15', 'have', 'winner', '26', 'rental']",N/A

As always things are never as they seem. It is 1957 when Bryce moves next door to Juli. Juli is forceful, even at age 7. Bryce has great hair, eyes, and smile. Juli is bright and has personality. Byrce's family is somewhat shallow, except for the grandfather. Juli's family is poor by comparison but they have different priorities. The story quickly moves to the seventh grade when Juli realizes that Bryce, while good-looking, may indeed be shallow and not the person of character she should be seeking. Meanwhile, Bryce realizes his short comings and sees that Juli is a person of substance. In addition to the good back and forth for what may be expected for kids that age, it includes as a bonus a good father-daughter relationship film as Juli learns what she needs to know about life from her father. What is good about the movie is that the characters are real. They are not all good or all bad, but human beings attempting to do what they think is right in spite of their flaws.This movie has an indie feel, and is enjoyable to the young at heart for people of all ages, but may be especially enjoyable to seventh grade girls.Rebecca De Mornay is barely recognizable as an early 60's mom.One scene of ""violence"" when Bryce's dad slaps his teen daughter for calling him an a-hole.",5,IT'S ALL ABOUT JULI,1291593600,"12 6, 2010",2010,1367,"['story', 'first', 'person', 'narrations', 'First', 'story', 'then', 'story', 'always', 'things', 'are', 'never', 'seem', '1957', 'when', 'Bryce', 'next', 'door', 'Juli', 'Juli', 'forceful', 'even', 'age', '7', 'Bryce', 'great', 'hair', 'eyes', 'smile', 'Juli', 'bright', 'personality', 'Byrce', 'family', 'somewhat', 'shallow', 'grandfather', 'Juli', 'family', 'poor', 'comparison', 'have', 'different', 'priorities', 'story', 'quickly', 'seventh', 'grade', 'when', 'Juli', 'Bryce', 'good-looking', 'may', 'indeed', 'be', 'shallow', 'not', 'person', 'character', 'should', 'be', 'seeking', 'Meanwhile', 'Bryce', 'short', 'comings', 'sees', 'Juli', 'person', 'substance', 'addition', 'good', 'back', 'forth', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'expected', 'kids', 'age', 'bonus', 'good', 'father-daughter', 'relationship', 'film', 'Juli', 'what', 'know', 'life', 'father', 'What', 'good', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'real', 'are', 'not', 'all', 'good', 'bad', 'human', 'beings', 'attempting', 'do', 'what', 'think', 'right', 'spite', 'flaws.This', 'movie', 'indie', 'feel', 'enjoyable', 'young', 'heart', 'people', 'ages', 'may', 'be', 'especially', 'enjoyable', 'seventh', 'grade', 'girls.Rebecca', 'De', 'Mornay', 'barely', 'recognizable', 'early', '60', 'mom.One', 'scene', 'violence', 'when', 'Bryce', 'dad', 'teen', 'daughter', 'calling', 'a-hole']",N/A

The main characters are age thirteen in 1963, as was I, and I found myself re-experiencing a lot of the discomfit I associate with that time.  The film accurately captures the culture of the 50's/early 60's where repression was the norm and most everyone did there best to hide anything that they imagined made them different.  The main characters learn important lessons about honesty and integrity and dealing with loss.  But perhaps the most important truth here is how a sensitive adult can change the life of a child by simply noticing their struggle and pointing them in the right direction.
