It's a little simplistic -- here are the bad guys and here are the good guys and there's no gray between and not many surprises. There was one twist which was good.

A twist at the end, gorgeous costumes, family-friendly story (though there is a heart attack and a deathbed scene, also a scene of harrassment that could have lead to rape though it does not get nearly that far and it is handled well, with a rescue that is a relief), with kindness and love prevailing in the end. I so did not like Ida that I did not like the actress either, but I love the other main characters. Baxter does seem a little bit forced but she is supposed to be light and fluffy, and her sincere big-heartedness makes up for it. The two girls are pre-cursors to today's feminists, wanting to do things that girls were not allowed to do then so it is nice to see such strong women roles. I do wish Edith had not been so stubborn in avoiding her true love for so long, just because of low self-esteem becuase he obviously really loved her, but I guess she had to go through her process to feel worthy.

Frankly I bopught this movie to review for someone else and surprisingly I liked it.Alcott herself is an interesting woman from an interesting family.  They were very influencial in American politics before the Civil War and Louisa served as a nurse in that war.  Female nurses were frowned upon for service in hospitals and one of the main features looked for was an uncomely, if not ugly appearance.

The very first part looked so refreshing that I threw in a tape and have absolutely been gone on it ever since.  I had read about the newly discovered manuscript and book publication at an earlier time.  I bought several copies of the book and gave them out as gifts to friends and relatives.  Everyone who has watched it with me has loved it.  My brother, in from Knoxville once, and after watching the usual popular movies at that time, was, up to that point fairly unimpressed.  I decided to put it in.  He watched and even though he had not even commented on any of the others, he looked at me after the end credits then lights on, and said, ""That was a good one.""  You have to know my understated Economics Professor-of-a brother to know how funny that comment was and how it pleased me.  The filmed presentation and its screenplay are more flowing, integrated and related to a self-contained start-to-finish story than is the actual book. The scene where Edith is with her ailing uncle, her innocence, her lack of guile or ability to deceive, contrive or lie, is unbelievably attractive in character and essence.  Edith is so transparently good and kind and always helping others without taking credit this story is about the rewards of that goodness and that sweetness.  There are hints from the beginning that are noticed after the fact, about where the relationships lie and why certain people do what they do and act the way they do.  How could the entire story be so simple and yet enchanting enough to cause me to think of it all the time.  When Edith first meets Percy by the horse, spilling her apples and yet touching his scratched face with her handkerchief I loved the way the directors let us know the magic was on.  When Percy comes in the house for the first time and meets her Edith cannot hide her bright-eyed, innocent crush and that she has met him already.  Her facial expressions are uniquely well done as she hides behind the curtain.  You can see that she is jealous already, even though she knows he is not there for her nor could there be a crossing of social barriers, yet he was hers, she thought.

857290,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B00062IZ0Y,Byron Kolln,"[3, 3]","Based on Louisa May Alcott's long-lost debut novel, THE INHERITANCE is a delightful period romp for anyone who loves to get carried away by romance and intrigue.Edith Adelon (Cari Shayne) lives with the wealthy Hamilton family at their Evenswood estate in Concord, Mass., as a companion for their daughter Amy (Brigitta Dau).  Not quite a servant but not quite a member of the family either, Edith's position grows more precarious as the family awaits visitors for the annual Greens Cup ball and horse-race:  snooty cousin Ida (Brigid Walsh-Brannagh) and handsome bachelor James Percy (Thomas Gibson) throw even more complications into the mix for poor Edith.  When James starts falling for Edith, her lack of breeding and station sets the catalyst for family secrets to be revealed and true destinies to be discovered...THE INHERITANCE is full of memorable, endearing performances, in particular Tom Conti as the Hamilton patriarch.  He turns what could have been a throwaway character into the true heartbeat of the story.  Cari Shayne gives a winsome 'Cinderella' quality to the role of the selfless Edith.  Meredith Baxter is also very fine as Mrs Beatrice Hamilton.  Brigitta Dau and Brigid Walsh-Brannagh do what they can with the most one-dimensional characters in the piece.Louisa May Alcott's original novel, written when she was only seventeen and later buried in a trunk, was a trite and highly-romanticised variation of the 'Cinderella' story; this 1997 television adaptation gives more backbone to the character of Edith and the entire story flows in a very fresh and appealing way.For anyone who loves a good old-fashioned romance, THE INHERITANCE is the perfect movie to while away a rainy Saturday afternoon.",4,delightful period romp,1188000000,"08 25, 2007",2007,1724,"['Based', 'Louisa', 'May', 'Alcott', 'long-lost', 'debut', 'novel', 'INHERITANCE', 'delightful', 'period', 'romp', 'anyone', 'who', 'get', 'carried', 'away', 'romance', 'intrigue.Edith', 'Adelon', 'Cari', 'Shayne', 'wealthy', 'Hamilton', 'family', 'Evenswood', 'estate', 'Concord', 'Mass.', 'companion', 'daughter', 'Amy', 'Brigitta', 'Dau', 'Not', 'quite', 'servant', 'not', 'quite', 'member', 'family', 'Edith', 'position', 'more', 'precarious', 'family', 'visitors', 'annual', 'Greens', 'Cup', 'ball', 'horse-race', 'snooty', 'cousin', 'Ida', 'Brigid', 'Walsh-Brannagh', 'handsome', 'bachelor', 'James', 'Percy', 'Thomas', 'Gibson', 'throw', 'even', 'more', 'complications', 'mix', 'poor', 'Edith', 'When', 'James', 'falling', 'Edith', 'lack', 'breeding', 'station', 'catalyst', 'family', 'secrets', 'be', 'revealed', 'true', 'destinies', 'be', 'discovered', 'INHERITANCE', 'full', 'memorable', 'endearing', 'performances', 'particular', 'Tom', 'Conti', 'Hamilton', 'patriarch', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'throwaway', 'character', 'true', 'heartbeat', 'story', 'Cari', 'Shayne', 'winsome', ""'Cinderella"", 'quality', 'role', 'selfless', 'Edith', 'Meredith', 'Baxter', 'also', 'very', 'fine', 'Mrs', 'Beatrice', 'Hamilton', 'Brigitta', 'Dau', 'Brigid', 'Walsh-Brannagh', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'most', 'one-dimensional', 'characters', 'piece.Louisa', 'May', 'Alcott', 'original', 'novel', 'written', 'when', 'was', 'only', 'seventeen', 'later', 'buried', 'trunk', 'was', 'trite', 'highly-romanticised', 'variation', ""'Cinderella"", 'story', '1997', 'television', 'adaptation', 'more', 'backbone', 'character', 'Edith', 'entire', 'story', 'very', 'fresh', 'appealing', 'way.For', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'romance', 'INHERITANCE', 'perfect', 'movie', 'while', 'away', 'rainy', 'Saturday', 'afternoon']",N/A

It is surprising that she wrote such a ""chick lit"" type of book, but included in not so subtle fashion are some of her feminist and independent ideas.  So her forward thinking spirit still shines through.  The story focuses on a girl who has been the companion to a well to do girl.  The family pretty much accepts her as their own, although, some of the other members of their high class society resent their acceptance of a simple commoner into their fold.  All is well until a girl comes to live with them who flat out has it in for the companion.  She is the stereotypical manipulator, what we call nowadays the typical ""mean girl"", and convinces the commoner that she isn't good enough for the young bachelor whose attention she has captured nor good enough to remain at the home of the Hamiltons.  It appears that the vindictive girl might even succeed in her machinations . . . until a long held secret is uncovered.  The guy portraying the lead love interest, Thomas Gibson, is one of the handsomer actors I've seen recently.

The story moved along quickly, with lots of reversals along the way. I like that in a story.One thing I would like to see is less dialogue, with more expressed through the characters' faces and mannerisms, through close-up shots and lighting to fill in the mood. It makes all the difference between a very nice film and an unforgettable film. The ""over-dialogue"" tendency probably stems from the fact that this film is an adaptation of a book-a very different medium. In a book you don't have the visual element. When it goes to film, the affective impact of a simple facial expression can go much farther than a character expounding on his or her thoughts. For example, when Edith catches her friend with his hand in the pot, instead of a wordy confrontation, just a look of angry disappointment, punctuated by the score, a close-up of her face, with darker lighting and a shadow over her friend's face would have really driven the point home in a more engaging way. Then, a long pause followed by, ""Promise you won't tell."" That would have made it more dramatic. As it was, too much dialogue meant too light a movie; I wasn't quite as engaged as I wanted to be, which is common with book-to-film adaptations, but the plot kept me interested with a devious character stirring up the pot in a variety of ways, but with a reversal quickly enough so you don't spend half the movie irritated at a consistent, overwhelming, and prolonged lack of justice. The fast reversals moved the story along well, too. And the acting was generally quite good. I'd like to see more tension between the characters, though, with more dramatic divisions and reconnects. A very light film as it is. Still very nice.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[14, 14]","If ""Little Women"" is the novel wrapped around Jo March, then ""The Inheritance"" is her sister Beth -- small and unnoticed, but sweet and beautiful all the same. This lovely period TV movie is (very loosely) based on the mediocre novel of the same name, by the classic author Louisa May Alcott, and this is one of the few instances where the movie is vastly better than the book.Edith Adelon (Cari Shayne) has lived with the wealthy Hamilton family ever since she was a baby, and is now the companion of bookish Amy (Brigitta Dau), and a good horsewoman to boot. But her life changes with the arrival of two guests at the Hamiltons' home: the beautiful, calculating Ida (Brigid Conley Walsh) and handsome James Percy (Thomas Gibson).James and Edith are drawn together first as friends, and then by something deeper. But Ida, who wants him for herself, manipulates Edith into rejecting James when he proposes to her. Then after Edith takes place in a famed horse race, mysterious thefts and a family tragedy threaten to derail her entire life with the Hamiltons.Louisa May Alcott wrote ""The Inheritance"" when she was only seventeen, and the book is syrupy, over-romancitized and cliched. But the movie ""The Inheritance"" is what Alcott probably would have turned the book into, had she rewritten it instead of burying it in a trunk. The wilting lily Edith is replaced with a strong, friendly young woman, and the plot is spiced up with some social commentary.To some degree, it's a typical love-conquers-all romance, and the dialogue borders on cheesy at times, although overall the scripting pretty good. It's the execution that is likeable. The characters ramble around lush manorhouses full of light and beauty, or idyllic forests. And the gooey romance is glossed over with some sharp commentary on stuffy traditions and hypocrisies, such as why women were not allowed to ride astride. Also a touch of tragedy, when one of the characters dies.Cari Shayne is quite good as Edith, especially since she has to be so NICE all the time. Such a character could have been nauseating instead of nice, and she has some nice chemistry with Gibson. Walsh is not so good, but the rest of the supporting cast are excellent as the loving, quirky Hamiltons.""The Inheritance"" takes the same-named novel and rips it apart, turns it inside out, reembroiders it and sticks it back together -- and the result is remarkably polished and strong.

I think the mistake lies in making one female character such an all out villain with apparently no redeeming qualities who set out to make as many enemies as she could. All the actors did a great job and it is well photographed with many lovely scenes of horseback riding. I do argue with the director's choice of having her riding in pants astride on an every day basis.  This simply would not have been done in that period of time. It would have increased the drama if she had, all of a sudden, donned pants to ride in the race.  But, I haven't read the book and I don't know what Alcott wrote. I also argue with the fact that the heroine would have meekly agreed to go and take care of somebody's aunt leaving the home where she knows she is loved and wanted. Why would she all of a sudden turn so meek and downtrodden.  Didn't make any sense.  Her attempt to burn the proof of her inheritance just didn't ring true.

Yippee!Review update (3-12-06): One of the other reviewers wrote that Amazon was now selling the uncut version of The Inheritance and not the one put out by Feature Films For Family.  I decide to order it myself on that recommendation.  I am excited to report that the reviewer was right.  Amazon is now selling the complete, uncut version of the movie.  It is put out by Aliant Atlantis and Plantimum Disk.  Do get the movie in this uncut version, you will be glad you did.  Now if someone would do Borrowed Hearts uncut I would be a very happy camper.  I leave the earlier review here as a warning to others to not buy from Feature Films For Families unless you are ready for the movie to be cut and altered.I love this movie and my 13 year old daughter did too.  And there was nothing to be worried about her seeing, even in the uncut version.Old review:As the other reviewers have mentioned, this is a good, clean, romantic, period movie.  Read those reviews for an overview of the movie.I need to complain though about Feature Films for Families (Family Feature Films).  They, with Aliant Atlantis (this group has done an excellent job on other movies I have, so don't judge them by this one), put out this copy of the movie.  I have another movie from Feature Films for Families, Borrowed Hearts, a great Christmas movie for the whole family.  I have seen and have taped from TV the original cut of this movie.  Pieces are missing on the DVD, some of my favorite pieces.  I bought the DVD from them thinking, ""Wow, I can now have this on DVD,"" was I disappointed.  They cut this movie so ""they"" feel it is acceptable.  They have cut good scenes. Scenes that help tell the story.  Scenes that I, as a Christian with a strong Christian world view, did not find offensive.I have never seen The Inheritance, but I could tell without a doubt where they cut a scene.  The scene cut from The Inheritance seemed like an important scene and by the way the rest of the movie was made, I bet the scene was tastefully done.  The scene was so important to the story, that the next scene left me more than slightly confussed and guessing about what happened.  It was very disruptive to the story.If you have seen this movie on TV or in it's completeness somewhere else, the Feature Films For Families version will leave you feeling cheated.  If you haven't seen this movie and you get a hold of their version of the DVD, be warned that there is a scene missing so you can be prepared for the break in action.This film is worth seeing, do so if you can.  If you are looking for an uncut version of the movie, don't get it from Feature Films for Families (Family Feature Films).  I will never buy a movie from them again.  I just wish I could get a good, uncut, DVD version of Borrowed Hearts and The Inheritance from somewhere else.  I guess I will keep looking.

With an excellent cast and deft direction, this Cinderella-ish, happily-ever-after story is one that the whole family can enjoy.The film, which takes place in nineteenth century America,  focuses upon a wealthy family, the Hamiltons. Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton (Tom Conti and Meredith Baxter) live in elegant splendor on a vast estate with their bookish teenage daughter, Amy (Brigitta Dau), and her slightly older companion, Edith Adelon (Cari Shayne), whom Amy adores, along with a large retinue of servants. Edith has a place in the household that is somewhere between upstairs and downstairs, as she is more than a servant but not quite family.It appears that Edith, an orphan, has been raised in the household since infancy, when the Hamiltons went to Italy to settle the estate of Mr. Hamilton's estranged older brother. The Hamiltons found the infant Edith abandoned on the Italian estate of Mr. Hamilton's brother and believed her to be the daughter of a servant who died in childbirth. The Hamiltons were so smitten with her that they took her back to America with them and proceeded to raise her.Now a young woman, Edith's life is thrown into a tailspin when the Hamilton's beautiful cousin, Ida (Bridget Conley Walsh), comes to visit and be introduced to some eligible bachelors. The Hamiltons arrange for a very eligible and wealthy bachelor, James Percy (Thomas Gibson), to stay with them with an eye towards his making a love match with Ida.  While shopping, Edith, however,  briefly meets a handsome young man by the blacksmith's shop, and when their eyes lock, it is love at first sight. She later discovers when James Percy arrives that he is the young man with whom she has fallen in love and realizes that he is beyond her reach.The Hamiltons, however, include Edith in their social plans for Amy, Ida, and James, primarily as a companion for Amy so that Ida and James can have some time to get to know each other. When disaster strikes, however, and Edith saves the day, the Hamiltons reward her by inviting her to a ball. There,  the host takes offense that the Hamiltons should presume to insult him by appearing with the hired help, and Ida makes sure that Edith knows this, ruining Edith's evening in the process.This pomposity gets Mr. Hamilton's dander up, and he will brook no insult to Edith. Meanwhile, James has been smitten by Edith, who draws away from him because they inhabit two different worlds, a point that the mean-spirited and jealous Ida wastes no time in driving home. Edith also draws away from him because she believes that there is a budding romance between James and her beloved Amy, whom she would not hurt for all the love and money in the world. Meanwhile, Ida continues creating mischief.When Edith saves Mr. Hamilton's honor by winning a horserace against the pompous host of the ball that she attended,  all is well, more so because she defied convention, riding astride rather than sidesaddle. Then, Mr. Hamilton makes a discovery that shakes him to the core. A deathbed confession to Edith will bring tears to even the most hardened of viewers. This in turn causes Edith to make an unprecedented and noble decision. Unfortunately, on the heels of her potential sacrifice, a mysterious theft crops up, and Ida points the figure at Edith. At this juncture, a deus ex machina appears in the unlikely guise of a servant. Suffice it to say that all is well that ends well.I absolutely loved this film, despite the fact that it was somewhat predictable. It is just a lovely period film with fine performances by the entire cast. I still cannot understand why Thomas Gibson has not yet become a major star, given his exceeding good looks and talent. Tom Conti is especially endearing as the somewhat liberal blue blood who champions Edith.

The setting and story line was similar to that of many of my favorite English films, but this one had two very special touches to it. The beautiful and virtuous orphan named Edith Adelon, who grew up alongside and was companion to the daughter of the Estate's owner, was the center piece of the whole show. The father and gentleman of the Estate (Mr. Hamilton)was a progressive man, who loved the simple things in life, but without all the pride and bigotry of the then emerging Class Warfare. The mother, played by Meredith Baxter was soft, loving and quite the lady. I think this was her finest acting role I've ever seen her in. But in the mix of this very tear jerking love story, you had the two qualified suitors, vying for both the daughter and the daughter's orphan companion Edith, along with the inflexible rich neighbors, and the contest to see who's horse and who's eligible bachelors would end up with the prize (both prizes). My heart was moved with emotion and yes even with tears at the conclusion of this very witty tale, in which the bad man and the bad girl was put in their place, and the good guy and the good girl, were given the reward of each others heart as a prize to their intense love. The surprise ending was especially endearing because no one in their right mind would willingly give up the legal right and ownership of their own estate, just to keep things ""just as they are"". The maturity, beauty and goodly character of Edith Adelon would make the heart of any man glow, and her goodness and strength makes you want to wish her all the best.

I use it regularly as a discussion-starter with a group of teen girls I mentor. If we want our young ladies to grow up to be faithful friends and unpretentious and lovely on the inside, this movie has some good role models in it.For the more conservative viewer (and I mean VERY conservative) there is a scene with one mature woman helping her husband dress while wearing a corset with quite a bit of decollete showing, and one scene where a young man inappropriately kisses a young lady; another scene with a kiss, but between a mutually committed couple. Lots of affection between a married man and his wife, and between parents and their children. No rude language that I can remember.

This movie, The Inheritance, was a pleasant surprise and enjoyed very much. The story line is quite interesting (even including a couple of sinister characters that get their 'just-desserts' in the end)! I loved the fact that the movie centered around the main woman character and her 'birth-right'. This movie also shows her character pushing the 'conventional envelope' of the Victorian time period. There are loving, kind people surrounding her, and her own personal character shines through for the good of all, including herself in the end.

The costumes were exquisite, as well as the scenery - but in comparison to other great period films, like ""Little Women"", ""Pride & Predjudice"", ""Sense & Senisbility""..... this film won't stack up - it makes the adorable, but ""B"" movie list.It is still a decent watch if one can cast aside the ""film critic"" mentality.
