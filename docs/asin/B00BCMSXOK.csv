There was no sex, violence, drugs, or nudity. There are a couple of drinking scenes in a bar featuring beer and wine; low cut shirts on women, and a character is rude to people but he changes.  Most people would skip it because they think it is too predictable or &#34;lame&#34;, but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been &#34;slimed&#34;. The Dove Foundation gave it a five star and approved it for all ages.This is an great family movie that focuses on following your heart and your own dreams, instead of what others want you to do.  Beth, a high school glee club teacher, manages to get big country singer/star Jason Keith to appear at the Fairland Strawberry Festival.  Beth always stands up to Jason, something he isn't used to. They soon become friends and she also learns why he has cancelled performances in the past and has a reputation for having a temper.  As Jason spends more time with Beth, his attitude starts to fade, he opens up to her and they each encourage the other to follow their dreams.Overall, I loved this movie and will watch it again.",5,Strawberry Summer - would definately watch again,1372636800,"07 1, 2013",2013,1247,"['like', 'good', 'clean', 'movies', 'as', 'clean', 'can', 'get', 'nowadays', 'Strawberry', 'Summer', 'was', 'really', 'really', 'clean', 'was', 'sex', 'violence', 'drugs', 'nudity', 'are', 'couple', 'drinking', 'scenes', 'bar', 'featuring', 'beer', 'wine', 'low', 'cut', 'shirts', 'women', 'character', 'rude', 'people', 'Most', 'people', 'would', 'skip', 'think', 'too', 'predictable', '34', 'lame', '34', 'like', 'movies', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'something', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'feel', 'have', 'just', 'been', '34', 'slimed', '34', 'Dove', 'Foundation', 'gave', 'five', 'star', 'approved', 'ages.This', 'great', 'family', 'movie', 'following', 'heart', 'own', 'dreams', 'instead', 'what', 'others', 'want', 'do', 'Beth', 'high', 'school', 'glee', 'club', 'teacher', 'get', 'big', 'country', 'singer/star', 'Jason', 'Keith', 'appear', 'Fairland', 'Strawberry', 'Festival', 'Beth', 'always', 'up', 'Jason', 'something', ""n't"", 'used', 'soon', 'become', 'friends', 'also', 'why', 'cancelled', 'performances', 'past', 'reputation', 'having', 'temper', 'Jason', 'more', 'time', 'Beth', 'attitude', 'fade', 'up', 'encourage', 'other', 'follow', 'dreams.Overall', 'loved', 'movie', 'will', 'watch', 'again']",Strawberry Summer
1625438,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00BCMSXOK,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[6, 6]","In the quaint town of Fairland, somewhere in California, Beth Landon (Julie Mond) has gone out on a limb. An aspiring singer once, and a high school English teacher today and director of her school's glee club, Beth has lobbied for country singer Jason Keith (Trevor Donovan) to perform at her town's annual Strawberry Festival. Beth's already been selected as this year's Strawberry Queen and so has to appear in several festival events. Mr. Keith, besides performing, is also tapped as the Grand Marshal. It's setting out to be a fine Strawberry Festival.Except that Jason Keith turns out to be a first class tool, unfailingly inconsiderate. He's rude and dismissive and tardy. Beth, who's a big fan and tends to sing along to the guy's crossover hit ""Easy Heart,"" is chagrined. But she's got spunk. She's a real spitfire. From jump she doesn't hesitate to call him out on his difficult behavior. And because this is a Hallmark joint and the network prefers to keep things conventional (and I probably mean that in a good way), you can predict what happens from that point on. There's comfort in familiarity, I know. I flip over to Hallmark when I'm in the mood for a sappy romance. Julie Mond and Trevor Donovan are actors I'd never heard of, but I enjoyed watching them work their roles. They generate a spark together.Donovan is the bigger surprise in that he's able to make you like him despite his unmannerly bad boy character. I guess it helps that his boorish exterior and ""too cool for school"" demeanor mask a heap of insecurities. Nashville heartthrob Jason Keith, it turns out, is a country singer purely by accident. Thru the course of the festival, Beth and Jason squabble and quibble and finally call a truce. There's fun in watching Jason undergo an attitude adjustment and morph from jerk to caring guy. When we finally get to the end and Jason sings on stage, we feel pretty good about him. And if that's truly Trevor Donovan singing, then all sorts of props to him because his singing voice is striking.Beth's character arc isn't as sweeping. She was already at a good place when the film began. She's our point-of-view character, and she's best when playing foil to Jason Keith. And who knows? Maybe being around the guy long enough will rekindle her ambition for a singing career. Just maybe. Nothing much more to say about STRAWBERRY SUMMER. It aired in 2012. Shelley Long has a nice supporting bit as Beth's mom. There are some funny moments, mostly involving the cocky country superstar getting taken down a peg once or three times. It's silly, but the strawberry judging contest - in which the contestants had to incorporate strawberry into their various dishes - had me grinning pretty good. This sequence is probably what made me start thinking better of Jason Keith. If you're cruising channels and you end up on the Hallmark Channel and STRAWBERRY SUMMER is on, consider sticking around. You may pick up some fascinating recipes for strawberries.",4,a small-town school teacher tries to tame a country singer with a New York state of mind,1373760000,"07 14, 2013",2013,2975,"['quaint', 'town', 'Fairland', 'somewhere', 'California', 'Beth', 'Landon', 'Julie', 'Mond', 'gone', 'out', 'limb', 'aspiring', 'singer', 'once', 'high', 'school', 'English', 'teacher', 'today', 'director', 'school', 'glee', 'club', 'Beth', 'lobbied', 'country', 'singer', 'Jason', 'Keith', 'Trevor', 'Donovan', 'perform', 'town', 'annual', 'Strawberry', 'Festival', 'Beth', 'already', 'been', 'selected', 'year', 'Strawberry', 'Queen', 'so', 'appear', 'several', 'festival', 'events', 'Mr.', 'Keith', 'performing', 'also', 'tapped', 'Grand', 'Marshal', 'setting', 'out', 'be', 'fine', 'Strawberry', 'Festival.Except', 'Jason', 'Keith', 'out', 'be', 'first', 'class', 'tool', 'unfailingly', 'inconsiderate', 'rude', 'dismissive', 'tardy', 'Beth', 'who', 'big', 'fan', 'sing', 'along', 'guy', 'crossover', 'hit', 'Easy', 'Heart', 'chagrined', 'got', 'spunk', 'real', 'spitfire', 'jump', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'call', 'out', 'difficult', 'behavior', 'Hallmark', 'joint', 'network', 'prefers', 'keep', 'things', 'conventional', 'probably', 'mean', 'good', 'way', 'can', 'predict', 'what', 'point', 'comfort', 'familiarity', 'know', 'flip', 'Hallmark', 'when', ""'m"", 'mood', 'sappy', 'romance', 'Julie', 'Mond', 'Trevor', 'Donovan', 'are', 'actors', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'work', 'roles', 'generate', 'spark', 'together.Donovan', 'bigger', 'surprise', 'able', 'make', 'unmannerly', 'bad', 'boy', 'character', 'guess', 'boorish', 'exterior', 'too', 'cool', 'school', 'demeanor', 'mask', 'heap', 'insecurities', 'Nashville', 'heartthrob', 'Jason', 'Keith', 'out', 'country', 'singer', 'purely', 'accident', 'Thru', 'course', 'festival', 'Beth', 'Jason', 'squabble', 'quibble', 'finally', 'call', 'truce', 'fun', 'watching', 'Jason', 'attitude', 'adjustment', 'morph', 'jerk', 'caring', 'guy', 'When', 'finally', 'get', 'end', 'Jason', 'sings', 'stage', 'feel', 'pretty', 'good', 'truly', 'Trevor', 'Donovan', 'singing', 'then', 'sorts', 'props', 'singing', 'voice', 'striking.Beth', 'character', 'arc', ""n't"", 'sweeping', 'was', 'already', 'good', 'place', 'when', 'film', 'began', 'point-of-view', 'character', 'best', 'when', 'playing', 'foil', 'Jason', 'Keith', 'who', 'Maybe', 'being', 'guy', 'long', 'enough', 'will', 'rekindle', 'ambition', 'singing', 'career', 'Just', 'maybe', 'Nothing', 'much', 'more', 'say', 'STRAWBERRY', 'SUMMER', 'aired', '2012', 'Shelley', 'Long', 'nice', 'supporting', 'bit', 'Beth', 'mom', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'mostly', 'involving', 'cocky', 'country', 'superstar', 'getting', 'taken', 'down', 'peg', 'once', 'three', 'times', 'silly', 'strawberry', 'judging', 'contest', 'contestants', 'had', 'incorporate', 'strawberry', 'various', 'dishes', 'had', 'grinning', 'pretty', 'good', 'sequence', 'probably', 'what', 'made', 'start', 'thinking', 'better', 'Jason', 'Keith', ""'re"", 'cruising', 'channels', 'end', 'up', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'STRAWBERRY', 'SUMMER', 'consider', 'sticking', 'around', 'may', 'pick', 'up', 'fascinating', 'recipes', 'strawberries']",Strawberry Summer
