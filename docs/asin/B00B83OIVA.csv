Suffice to say the plot twists are interesting and have a lot of surprises. Some tips:----Don't read if you don't want spoilers1)  It's okay to have sex with your sibling, as long as he covers his body with a lifestory of tattoos that he'll unveil for the female audience every episode.2) if someone is depicted as the most evil, heinous villain in the first episode, wait for someone else to get that reveal later.3) If you're gay in this town, spend less time dyeing your hair blonde, and more time on mountain climbing lessons.4) If you give Elizabeth Moss a gun with a full load of bullets, plan your teen roofie party for *after* she leaves town. Duh.5) If you're a female resident of Laketop, you can turn a blind eye to decades of teen abuse, while Elizabeth Moss fills all the men with bullet holes.Enjoy your stay in Middle Earth!",4,Handy tips for LakeTop visitors,1394668800,"03 13, 2014",2014,953,"['Elizabeth', 'Moss', 'Miss', 'Marples', 'special', 'trip', 'New', 'Zealand', 'found', 'story', 'fairly', 'good', 'bit', 'long', 'Suffice', 'say', 'plot', 'twists', 'are', 'interesting', 'have', 'lot', 'surprises', 'tips', 'Do', ""n't"", 'read', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoilers1', 'okay', 'have', 'sex', 'sibling', 'as', 'long', 'body', 'lifestory', 'tattoos', ""'ll"", 'unveil', 'female', 'audience', 'episode.2', 'someone', 'depicted', 'most', 'evil', 'heinous', 'villain', 'first', 'episode', 'wait', 'someone', 'else', 'get', 'reveal', 'later.3', ""'re"", 'gay', 'town', 'spend', 'less', 'time', 'dyeing', 'hair', 'blonde', 'more', 'time', 'mountain', 'climbing', 'lessons.4', 'give', 'Elizabeth', 'Moss', 'gun', 'full', 'load', 'bullets', 'plan', 'teen', 'roofie', 'party', '*after*', 'town', 'Duh.5', ""'re"", 'female', 'resident', 'Laketop', 'can', 'turn', 'blind', 'eye', 'decades', 'teen', 'abuse', 'Elizabeth', 'Moss', 'men', 'bullet', 'holes.Enjoy', 'stay', 'Middle', 'Earth']",Top of the Lake

So, she was a revelation here to me as Det. Robin Griffin.  Her charm and beauty sneak up on you.  Her acting seems effortless and natural until you realize that she's playing Kiwi here and pulling it off brilliantly.  The accent alone makes you realize how much work a top actress like this puts in to making herself be the character.Still, despite Moss' sterling work here, what will stick with you is the tour de force performance of Peter Mullan as local drug honcho, Matt Mitcham.  It is absolutely mesmerizing stuff that garnered Mullan a well-deserved Emmy nomination.  Writer/Director Jane Campion's script juxtaposes the misogynistic, hyper-masculine Mitcham with a male-averting group of women who've set up caravan on what he thought was land he controlled.  The women have followed their guru, GJ, here.  Right away you can tell: this meeting of macho and feminine independence isn't going to end well.  GJ is played with monosyllabic intensity by Campion collaborator, Holly Hunter.I also liked Thomas M. Wright as Mitcham's estranged son and Griffin's once-high school boyfriend, Johnno.  He rides to the rescue of Robin here time and time again.  Wright is also a player in the awesome Fx series, 'The Bridge.'  He's an actor worth watching.",5,Elisabeth Moss is wonderful but what will stick with you is the tour de force performance of Peter Mullan,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,1383,"['was', 'not', 'watcher', ""'West"", 'Wing', 'now-concluding', 'Men', 'was', 'not', 'familiar', 'work', 'Elisabeth', 'Moss', 'So', 'was', 'revelation', 'here', 'Det', 'Robin', 'Griffin', 'charm', 'beauty', 'sneak', 'up', 'acting', 'effortless', 'natural', 'realize', 'playing', 'Kiwi', 'here', 'pulling', 'off', 'brilliantly', 'accent', 'alone', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'work', 'top', 'actress', 'making', 'be', 'character.Still', 'Moss', 'sterling', 'work', 'here', 'what', 'will', 'stick', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'performance', 'Peter', 'Mullan', 'local', 'drug', 'honcho', 'Matt', 'Mitcham', 'absolutely', 'mesmerizing', 'stuff', 'garnered', 'Mullan', 'well-deserved', 'Emmy', 'nomination', 'Writer/Director', 'Jane', 'Campion', 'script', 'misogynistic', 'hyper-masculine', 'Mitcham', 'male-averting', 'group', 'women', 'who', ""'ve"", 'set', 'up', 'caravan', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'land', 'controlled', 'women', 'have', 'followed', 'guru', 'GJ', 'here', 'Right', 'away', 'can', 'tell', 'meeting', 'macho', 'feminine', 'independence', ""n't"", 'going', 'end', 'well', 'GJ', 'played', 'monosyllabic', 'intensity', 'Campion', 'collaborator', 'Holly', 'Hunter.I', 'also', 'liked', 'Thomas', 'M.', 'Wright', 'Mitcham', 'estranged', 'son', 'Griffin', 'once-high', 'school', 'boyfriend', 'Johnno', 'rescue', 'Robin', 'here', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'Wright', 'also', 'player', 'awesome', 'Fx', 'series', 'Bridge', 'actor', 'worth', 'watching']",Top of the Lake

Most of the characters were interesting, the setting was gorgeous, the general idea for the plot was decent.  All of the ingredients were there.  However.....  This should have been a 2 hour movie.  In stretching it out so much longer than that, the creators added so much that was unnecessary.  Unnecessary scenes.  Unnecessary characters.  And for the entire middle stretch of the series, nothing of substance actually happens.  In essence you could watch only the first episode and the last episode, and not miss much of importance.An example.  The gathering of women at ""Paradise"" adds absolutely nothing to the story.  If that entire aspect were cut, not a darned thing would change.The main character, the detective played by Elisabeth Moss (who did a good job), spends most of the series fumbling around without learning anything of use.  It is almost maddening how little of substance actually occurs during all of those investigative hours.  And when we finally, finally discover who the bad guy is, we realize that not one single thing that happened in all of those hours actually led to the discovery.

It sounded a lot like BROADCHURCH, which I had just watched and enjoyed.  Luckily, it turned out that TOP OF THE LAKE was a lot more mysterious and moody in its presentation - something I happen to particularly enjoy.  Straight-out cop dramas don't hold a lot of interest for me, just to give readers an idea where this reviewer is coming from.  So I was particularly intrigued with the character played by Holly Hunt - an enlightened but somewhat gruff &#34;guru&#34; who was being followed by a group of &#34;damaged&#34; women who had come to the little town of &#34;Paradise&#34; in an attempt to heal mind, body and spirit.  I found this segment of TOTL to be the most interesting, so I was a bit disappointed that it seemed to garner the least amount of screen time.  But that aside, Holly Hunter & the other band of misfit women brought a real spark of philosophy to the show that raised it a notch above most of its &#34;competitors.&#34;The plot kept the viewer guessing from moment to moment - the crazy &#34;hillbilly&#34; father, his two drug-dealing sons, the missing girl's gay friend - the cast of characters was diverse and refreshingly unique.  Something the BBC can excel at.  I actually found the lead investigator to be the least interesting character of all.  Despite the sympathy which was built for her, and the ways in which she mirrored the missing girl's life history, I just found the character to be flat - but luckily the story held together in spite of that minor flaw.To avoid spoilers, I'll simply say that the story is intense, gripping and well-plotted and well-paced.  The music was exemplary - adding an element of mystery and sad overtones, similar to the unforgettable score from the old US series, TWIN PEAKS.  In fact, I found TOP OF THE LAKE to be similar in mood to Twin Peaks throughout - so if you are a fan of TP, I'm pretty sure you will find TOTL right up your alley.Performances throughout were excellent, and my only regret is that the series seems to have come to a final conclusion - all the loose ends tied up nicely, so it doesn't look like there will be a second season unless it takes off on a completely different storyline with different characters.

1623133,A1M36RIBC6IT7F,B00B83OIVA,Elyon,"[15, 24]","As crime drama and mystery, this series starts well, with an excellent cast of idiosyncratic and well-developing characters as well as a darker if beautiful portrayal of what has become a popularized Middle Earth.  Unfortunately the crime and mystery become somewhat derailed by Campion's decision to devote most of the latter half of the series to romantic and existential explorations which detract and distract from the series' initial identity and story-thread.  Plus the fundamental impediment to the evolving romance is summarily dismissed at the end by what can only be characterized as contrivance.On the plus side, the acting is excellent, as is the cinematography, direction and production values.  Thus, even more unfortunate that Campion cannot successfully or fully integrate the disparate elements of the series' distinct storylines, but instead chooses to focus on crime and mystery at the start, then shift the focus towards an emerging relationship in the second half, at the expense of the former.  The result is what could have become a series on par with Bron/Broen, Forbrydelsen, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, or Baran bo Odar's The Silence, but instead awkwardly becomes several stories clumsily separated and only marginally cobbled together at the end.

1623134,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B00B83OIVA,Eric Sanberg,"[3, 4]","It seems. for my money, that TV series have gotten so much better over the years. Better writing, acting, directing that have all been bolstered by better budgets. The proof is in the pudding here.Here's the scoop. Robin Griffin (Kate Moss) is a New Zealander who moved to Australia, became a police detective, and has moved back to New Zealand. She's on a case where a 12 year old local, Tui, has disappeared. Is she dead? Is she hiding? Dad is a local heavyweight with fingers in the drug trade. Robin needs to solve the case as old ghosts and local corruption rear their heads.This is a great mix of clever scripting and atmosphere. This particular area of New Zealand, and the season in which it is set, give it an almost otherworldly feeling. It's so remote and desolate that a foreboding cloud hangs over everything. Yet there is a certain beauty to it that is undeniable. The viewer is up in the clouds of some other planet. The situation is well realized and gets increasingly more scary as the characters develop and the histories between them begin to bloom. All the elements of the script are meted out evenhandedly and in subtle fashion. I felt as though I were watching things happen as opposed to being told they were happening. The music and sound design were also very good. They underscored the loneliness and remoteness of the place and the lives of those living there. And the plot is really good. You think it's all over and then there's that little something Robin sees that says it isn't.Jane Campion has been at it for years. She wrote and co-directed this and, for my dollar, she's at the top of her game. The only aspect of this I didn't care for was the Holly Hunter character heading up the women's commune. As you learn something of her in the final episode I suppose it makes sense. I merely found here annoying.

1623137,A13TO5TU4A68LD,B00B83OIVA,Gryphonisle,"[1, 2]","A 12 year old girl is seen trying to drown herself in the lake, and is found to be pregnant.  She disappears.  Her father is the small lakeside town's leading illicit businessman Matt Mitcham, patriarch of a well-off hill dwelling clan of white trash hellians ironically named (from the father on down) Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.  There's a current wife and a baby, but they only mumble in the shadows.  Visiting her dying mother in a nearby town, is a former local girl, Robin Griffin (now a detective in Australia) who is mustered into the investigation thanks to her training with children.  She runs into her former boyfriend from high school, Johnno, who is also a Mitcham, but apparently (aside from the missing 12 year old girl, Tui) the only nice one.  And, down on the lake shore, on a ranch called Paradise, is a brand new colony of damaged women led by their wealthy, gnomic guru, GJ, who out bid Matt for the property by a cool million.Paradise was apparently once Matt's family property, as he angrily reminds folks, and he's constantly promising his dead mother that she'll be buried there, but how it came to fall out of the family hands is never quite clear.It turns out that Matt's family, and many of the locals, produce a variety of drugs, including rufies, which are used in another local business, by the more upstanding citizens of the town and....oops!  Spoiler!It is here that a profound truth is revealed by one of the women in town, to Detective Griffin, who's trying to find Tui:  They all know what they're doing is wrong, and self destructive, but there aren't any other opportunities.  As the woman puts it &#34;I could go down to Christchurch and spend all day working for nothing...&#34;  The rotten core of our Anglo-American economies is this lack of opportunities for a growing number of our citizens.  But, it's only mentioned, and we return to the story, to find Tui, without dislodging the town's sordid economic underpinnings (as if this can be done) or worrying about what will happen if she's found, and everything is upended anyway...And of course, with all the biblical names, it's a nice touch that a Griffin is at first the only one trying to protect the child, given that the mythological character is a guardian of treasure, and wisdom, and often represents Christ.The setting is starkly gorgeous, the story is dark.  There are moments of humor (often from the women at Paradise) and Detective Griffin re-kindles her childhood romance with Johnno, the one decent Mitcham.  But essentially,  the movie's message is &#34;Men Are Pigs&#34;.  I was reminded of Hannah Arendt's &#34;Banality of evil&#34; thesis, which she postulated after sitting through the Nuremberg trials of notorious Nazi (but no Soviet) killers.  Before her were men charged with the most monstrous of crimes who, nonetheless, had nothing monstrous about them; rather, they looked like people she knew; relatives, the postman, the grocer.  There's nothing redeeming about the Mitcham clan, or any of their associates.  They're white trash advertisements for abortion.  They're dirty, cruel, ill educated, foul mouthed, wretched examples of humanity.  Some of the more upstanding men in the story turn out to be just as foul, if better groomed and with straighter teeth, but essentially, all the men are either foul, or (on the positive side) ineffectual.  The women order them to strip if the women want to play, on their terms only;  or the men strip to rape women.  Women strip and walk around naked in a more artistic sense, all dropping lines of the sort one would want to draw, rather than play with.  It is the great weakness of this story that it is built with such blatant stereotypes.  Yes, much of Hollywood is just as weak (&#34;12 Years A Slave&#34; comes to mind) but just because the boys cuss and spit, is it really necessary to do the same?The seven episode version here is the Sundance Premier version that was presented over 7 hours, with one intermission and a lunch break.  It makes for incredible, near spellbinding watching, but I wouldn't call it unique;  &#34;unusual&#34; or &#34;distinct&#34;, perhaps, but not unique.  It's female, or even feminist, viewpoint is a large part of what makes it stand out from the crowd (along with the cinematography, of course), but we'd have to erase all the fine work from HBO and Showtime (and especially the BBC, the BBC Australia being a partner in this), in order to even begin to claim that no one is doing this sort of stuff.It also bears noting that, despite the subject matter, pretty much everything violent or crude of substance relative to what underpins the mystery, happens off screen.  Even when Matt shoots a dog, you don't actually see it.  Thus, for the more squeamish and those who can't take violence on a par with &#34;The Soprano's&#34;  you don't have to.  It's mentioned, it's suggested, but mostly, what's happening in the background stays in the background, and only bubbles up for suspense.If you want something to cut through the saccharine sweetness of the Holidays, break open a nice bottle of wine and snuggle in for a seven hour journey into the dark side of New Zealand, this is great entertainment.",4,Darkly Entertaining Crime

1623141,A106016KSI0YQ,B00B83OIVA,Jay Dickson,"[1, 1]","Every Jane Campion film or television project is worth seeing because of her intelligence, her political commitments, and her remarkable visuals; every one of them also has major flaws compounded by Campion's heavy-handedness with her messages. This recent miniseries produced, co-written, and co-directed by Campion is no exception to either rule: set in her native New Zealand, it involves a stunningly dramatic and mysterious setting, a mystery centered upon an atrocity committed to a beautiful girl, a determined detective trying to root out the truth, and a community around the victim that is involved in far more horrors than the detective ever dreamed. The parallels to the Danish TV show FORBRYDELSEN (THE KILLING) and to TWIN PEAKS (which also inspired the Danish series) are inescapable, especially given in how both those earlier shows matters of gender and violence stood front and center. Campion, of course, is one of the most intriguing feminist film directors in the world, are her analysis of violence committed against women is even more front and center than in its predecessors. In this miniseries, a 12 year-old girl, Tui (Jacqueline Joe), is found trying to walk into a great lake on New Zealand's South Island, and when she is rescued, it is discovered she is pregnant, but she refuses to name the father to a detective (Elisabeth Moss); soon after, she disappears entirely. As the detective becomes obsessed with finding this young girl, she runs up against an odd mixture of the lake's inhabitants: the girl's father (Peter Mullan), a violent and self-pitying local criminal patriarch; his son, the detective's former boyfriend, who comes to care for her; and an odd New Age community of women led by an androgynous, taciturn guru (Holly Hunter).Campion's trademark gorgeous visuals and dreamy pacing kept me through the entire miniseries, and its really something to see, with the alien landscape of New Zealand's stark Lake Wakitupu and its nearby dramatic neighbor Mount Earnshaw. Some of the most remarkable shots are of helicopters, showing the landscape dwarfing the insectlike people crawling on it, or reducing the colorful stacked railroad cars of the New Age community to the scale of mere children's blocks. Whether the miniseries works as an actual narrative, however, is another matter. The mystery itself isn't very interesting and is fairly guessable, as is the big twist in the final episodes; there's also too much revenge fantasy, with nearly every rapist (the miniseries is fairly crawling with them) implausibly shot or maimed by story's end. Of the major actors, Moss and Mullan do the best work. As the detective Robin, Moss is very different here from anything we've seen her do before, and her quiet ability to assume command is nicely done. Mullan is ideally cast as a terrifyingly mercurial man who wallows in self-pit and who can be surprisingly tender before erupting into cruelty: one of the best (and scariest) bits in the show is a long sequence involving Mullan's tryst with one of the women (Robyn Malcolm, in a warm and fine turn) from the compound. Although Holly Hunter does excellent work as the guru GJ, and can strikingly evoke her character's air of electric quietude, she's burdened a bit by her own movie star aura (a less well-known actress would probably have suited the part more effectively). Jacqueline Joe has an unearthly beauty as Tui, but perhaps no child actor could have pulled the part off convincingly: the mirror of GJ at a different age (willowy, prophetic, and surprisingly tough), Tui has so much symbolic weight freighted onto her by Robin and the film alike that she struggles under the burden of it.",4,Repeating the past,1389398400,"01 11, 2014",2014,3688,"['Jane', 'Campion', 'film', 'television', 'project', 'worth', 'seeing', 'intelligence', 'political', 'commitments', 'remarkable', 'visuals', 'one', 'also', 'major', 'flaws', 'compounded', 'Campion', 'heavy-handedness', 'messages', 'recent', 'miniseries', 'produced', 'co-written', 'co-directed', 'Campion', 'exception', 'rule', 'set', 'native', 'New', 'Zealand', 'stunningly', 'dramatic', 'mysterious', 'setting', 'mystery', 'centered', 'atrocity', 'committed', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'determined', 'detective', 'trying', 'root', 'out', 'truth', 'community', 'victim', 'involved', 'far', 'more', 'horrors', 'detective', 'ever', 'dreamed', 'parallels', 'Danish', 'TV', 'show', 'FORBRYDELSEN', 'THE', 'KILLING', 'TWIN', 'PEAKS', 'also', 'inspired', 'Danish', 'series', 'are', 'inescapable', 'especially', 'given', 'how', 'earlier', 'matters', 'gender', 'violence', 'stood', 'front', 'center', 'Campion', 'course', 'one', 'most', 'intriguing', 'feminist', 'film', 'directors', 'world', 'are', 'analysis', 'violence', 'committed', 'women', 'even', 'more', 'front', 'center', 'predecessors', 'miniseries', '12', 'year-old', 'girl', 'Tui', 'Jacqueline', 'Joe', 'found', 'trying', 'walk', 'great', 'lake', 'New', 'Zealand', 'South', 'Island', 'when', 'rescued', 'discovered', 'pregnant', 'name', 'father', 'detective', 'Elisabeth', 'Moss', 'soon', 'entirely', 'detective', 'becomes', 'obsessed', 'finding', 'young', 'girl', 'up', 'odd', 'mixture', 'lake', 'inhabitants', 'girl', 'father', 'Peter', 'Mullan', 'violent', 'self-pitying', 'local', 'criminal', 'patriarch', 'son', 'detective', 'former', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'care', 'odd', 'New', 'Age', 'community', 'women', 'led', 'androgynous', 'taciturn', 'guru', 'Holly', 'Hunter', '.Campion', 'trademark', 'gorgeous', 'visuals', 'dreamy', 'pacing', 'kept', 'entire', 'miniseries', 'really', 'something', 'see', 'alien', 'landscape', 'New', 'Zealand', 'stark', 'Lake', 'Wakitupu', 'nearby', 'dramatic', 'neighbor', 'Mount', 'Earnshaw', 'most', 'remarkable', 'shots', 'are', 'helicopters', 'showing', 'landscape', 'dwarfing', 'insectlike', 'people', 'crawling', 'reducing', 'colorful', 'stacked', 'railroad', 'cars', 'New', 'Age', 'community', 'scale', 'mere', 'children', 'blocks', 'miniseries', 'actual', 'narrative', 'however', 'matter', 'mystery', ""n't"", 'very', 'interesting', 'fairly', 'guessable', 'big', 'twist', 'final', 'episodes', 'also', 'too', 'much', 'revenge', 'fantasy', 'nearly', 'rapist', 'miniseries', 'fairly', 'crawling', 'implausibly', 'shot', 'maimed', 'story', 'end', 'major', 'actors', 'Moss', 'Mullan', 'do', 'best', 'work', 'detective', 'Robin', 'Moss', 'very', 'different', 'here', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'do', 'quiet', 'ability', 'assume', 'command', 'nicely', 'done', 'Mullan', 'ideally', 'cast', 'terrifyingly', 'mercurial', 'man', 'who', 'self-pit', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'surprisingly', 'tender', 'erupting', 'cruelty', 'one', 'best', 'scariest', 'bits', 'show', 'long', 'sequence', 'involving', 'Mullan', 'tryst', 'one', 'women', 'Robyn', 'Malcolm', 'warm', 'fine', 'turn', 'compound', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'excellent', 'work', 'guru', 'GJ', 'can', 'strikingly', 'evoke', 'character', 'air', 'electric', 'quietude', 'burdened', 'bit', 'own', 'movie', 'star', 'aura', 'less', 'well-known', 'actress', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'suited', 'part', 'more', 'effectively', 'Jacqueline', 'Joe', 'unearthly', 'beauty', 'Tui', 'perhaps', 'child', 'actor', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'part', 'convincingly', 'mirror', 'GJ', 'different', 'age', 'willowy', 'prophetic', 'surprisingly', 'tough', 'Tui', 'so', 'much', 'symbolic', 'weight', 'freighted', 'Robin', 'film', 'burden']",Top of the Lake

I decided that I would comment on the imagery, performances and try to put in some perspective re: other programs.First and foremost, kudos to Sundance.  There are an increasing number of good and unique programs coming from Australia/NZ that don't make it through conventional channels to the USA.  Apparently, Sundance co-funded with a sub of the BBC, who stepped in when ABC (Australian Broadcasting Company) pulled funding when an American actress (Elizabeth Moss) was cast in a lead role (I guess that it is OK for Aussie actors/actresses to work on USA produced programming, but not the inverse?)The catch phrase for describing this series is the opening scene of a young girl (Tui - 1/2-Thai) peddling her bike from the family compound to a lake, wadding in, being noticed and pulled out when the monitor of a passing school bus recognizes her and as the school nurse is toweling her off, low and behold, a baby ""bump"".  While this might be a lot to process in its own right, there are so many layers of complexity that simply thinking that the story is about a pregnant 12-old girl that goes missing, does a disservice.As the show progressed, the best (though far from perfect) analogy that I came up with, was that TOL has elements of the AMC (AKA USA) version of the program ""The Killing"" with perhaps of small element of ""Twin Peaks"" mixed in.Moss does an admirable job putting her Kiwi on, as a Sidney Detective visiting her cancer ridden mom and being drawn into the case due her experience with children.  There is also some time given to Moss's back story while in HS at the TOL.Holly Hunter gives a strange performance as some sort of sage that sets up a commune by the lake where woman with various ""issues"" all live in shipping containers.Peter Mullan delivers the best performance of all as Matt Mitcham, Tui's father (from a prior marriage) and family patriarch.  I racked my brain searching for other performances by Peter Mullan and came back with 2-seasons of the BBC program ""The Fixer"" (Mickey).The imagery alone of TOL will have you running to google to price out flights and accommodations.Patience pays off, as by the final episode the laundry list of questions are answered.While this might not be for everyone, it is so unique, disturbing and complex, that if you find yourself in the right frame of mind, highly recommended.",4,4 1/2* Elizabeth Moss Does Kiwi Well!

Overall, it is a dark mystery -- slowly evolving and disturbing on a number of levels (and meant to be disturbing and thought-provoking).

It reminds me of a troubling dream sequence when the shadow of the unease that the dream inspired carries over into the next day.

1623154,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00B83OIVA,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[16, 17]","The enigmatic seven-part miniseries ""Top of the Lake"" is a slow burn mystery that takes its time to unravel. But, in many ways, this is more than just a traditional crime drama. The location becomes a significant (if not the most significant) character in a study of a community in isolation. Gorgeous New Zealand locales serve as the exotic backdrop to a land defined by those who inhabit it. It's not an easy place to escape as our heroine (Elizabeth Moss) discovers. As a detective returning to her home town, Moss is undeniably haunted by her past and wanting some form of closure. When an underage girl becomes pregnant, Moss is put on the case and she starts to work out her own demons as well. Can she save both the girl and herself? Beauty and tranquility are juxtaposed with crime and desperation. In the hands of Oscar winner Jane Campion (The Piano), ""Top of the Lake"" plays to some of the same themes as AMC's recent ""The Killing"" with a dash of ""Twin Peaks"" thrown in. It's a dark, brooding, and oftentimes eccentric look at a community that exists by its own rules.The jumping off point in this miniseries is, indeed, the discovery of a pregnant twelve year old. Moss, a specialist in these types of child endangerment cases, is close by attending to her sick mother. She agrees to interview the girl, and forms a close bond. When the girl disappears soon after, Moss can't seem to relinquish the case even though her family commitments require her elsewhere. Her obsession leads her to confront the town that she left behind, the place that almost destroyed her. The girl's family are an unsavory bunch. The patriarch (a great Peter Mullan) is the local crime boss and drug lord and he and his sons become quick suspects. Moss even has a past with one of the boys (Thomas M Wright). Further complicating matters is a woman's commune with an eccentric leader (Holly Hunter), a barkeep with a past, a couple of unexplained deaths, and an Inspector (David Wenham) whose motives may be questionable. Through the investigation, Moss comes face to face with a past that may be too difficult to acknowledge.I know that some may think that ""Top of the Lake"" is overlong. And if all you are looking for is a concise answer to the central mystery, perhaps this will be a bit slow and/or methodical for you. But I really liked the texture of the piece. The investigation is not necessarily linear, everyone that Moss encounters isn't automatically tied to the girl's disappearance. You get a real sense of place, as I said, everything is interwoven in the overlapping story threads. Campion has assembled a terrific cast as well. Moss (Mad Men) steps into a true leading role and displays a great mix of toughness and vulnerability. Mullan is magnetic as well, a powder keg just waiting to explode. Hunter is ethereal and oftentimes unnerving, it's very hard to describe her character. But I really liked just about everyone in this crazy little town. Heck, even Lucy Lawless pops up unexpectedly for scene or two.""Top of the Lake"" isn't a fast action adventure. It unfolds at its own pace, it both requires patience and rewards it. In the end, I really enjoyed this miniseries. I'm not sure that the final revelations adequately explained everything, there were still a number of issues that I felt could use further exposition. But this is still worthy of reaching an adult audience looking for something a bit darker and different than conventional television fare.

That kept me watching it from beginning to end.,5,Top of the Lake,1380758400,"10 3, 2013",2013,228,"['was', 'awesome', 'mini', 'series', 'kept', 'suspense', 'end', 'Did', 'not', 'expect', 'ending', 'did', 'suspect', 'lead', 'detective', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'girl', 'kept', 'watching', 'beginning', 'end']",Top of the Lake
1623161,ANGNKTK2J7JFF,B00B83OIVA,Madeline,"[2, 2]","To be honest, I'm generally extremely wary of shows like ""Top of the Lake."" In the past I've found them to be boring, pretentious, poorly done not to mention often needlessly depressing. I just kept seeing such great reviews for it though, and eventually thought, ""why not, watching the first episode can't hurt."" Reader be warned. You won't be able to just watch the first episode. About a day later, you will find yourself with bleary eyes and the realization that you just watched one of the finest  contributions to film of the year.To start off, it's not boring in the slightest which really makes no sense as a basic read of the plot would indicate that it should be. The essentials are that a young girl becomes pregnant, goes missing, and then the main character who is a detective spends the rest of the series talking to people trying to figure out what happened to the girl. However, writer and director Jane Campion has a brilliant ability to really draw out the major events and sustain the tension throughout long periods without big action sequences. She uses atmosphere and psychology to keep things riveting even when it's just two people talking to each other. Despite much of the major plot twists happening off-screen actually, Campion frames these events through the people who they affect and in turn these events take on a deeper meaning than if you saw them on-screen.As far as atmosphere and cinematography, ""Top of the Lake"" is positively stunning. Filmed in entirely on location in New Zealand, Campion doesn't need CGI or tricks for high impact--she let's the scenery speak for itself. This is no low budget production either. The quality of picture and color rivals that of any summer blockbuster.Now, this series does deal with some very heavy topics. Obviously, pedophilia is discussed--but so are a host of other things. Cancer, a parent's lies, incest, rape, sexism, misogyny, mental illness, clinical depression and organized crime all get the full treatment. Herein lies Campion's true gift. She somehow is able to craft the story and characters in such a way as to not drown the watcher in such a bleak and awful world and yet doesn't hold back from her subject matter either. Campion is also able to present these topics in a way that seems natural and integral to the story, instead of esoteric and pretentious.Holly Hunter's ""GJ"" character who is sort of a therapist/hippie/con artist/cult leader, did sometimes come across as a little over the top for me. Yet I could see how important her character was to the story and even the plot in spurring others to action.In short, this miniseries is gorgeous with stunning acting and a plot that is very dark yet won't overwhelm either. It should be obvious that this is most certainly not something for kids, but I would imagine almost all other age groups would find something to both enjoy as well as really contemplate. To often I find film to be used as a method for simply communication or entertainment, but it's the rare film that is all those things as well as art. And this is in fact one of those rare films that is both entertaining and provoking as well as exquisitely crafted art.

On your right, we have a conspicuously beautiful New Zealand landscape, all foggy mountains, pine forests, misty lakes. Straight ahead is Paradise. Literally. On your left, however, nothing is as it seems.  Everyone harbors a secret, some inner darkness, some seed of madness or corruption or evil.  Even the most innocent are caught up in whatever malevolence permeates the freezing waters and the chill air at Top of the Lake.This is David Lynch on steriods.  The story covers 9 of the 7 deadly sins, every major vice is present and accounted for, nobody is who you think they are and just when you think you have someone pegged, you don't.  The 7 episode mystery is as compelling a piece of television as I have ever encountered.  .Edgy and disorienting, the plot centers around the pregnancy and disappearance of 12-year old Tui Michum.  Australian police detective Robin Griffin (played by ""Mad Men's"" Elisabeth Moss) returns to her hometown in New Zealand to spend time with her dying mother. A specialist in crimes against children, Griffin is asked to investigate the case by her friend and former mentor, the  the local top cop affably played by David Wenham. Holly Hunter plays a small but key role as a genuinely wise and down to earth guru to a bunch of women who end up at the Lake because they pretty much have no place else left to go.  The entire cast is excellent, particularly Jacquine Joe as Tui, and Peter Mullan as Tui's father, Mack, by turns charming, vicious, monsterous and frequently all too human.Where is Tui and who fathered her baby? That's just the beginning.  The lake harbors many secrets and a couple of red herrings.  There is intense drama, romance, real sadness, madness, some humor and lots of good writing...and the curveballs keep coming at you.  During the last fifteen minutes of episode 7, it's all you can do not to duck.

Holly is back in a far different guise here, but a fascinating character, as are so many in this seven-part, strange mystery. Campion tends to deal with sexual issues with an iconoclastic view. Things are a little more normal here, but still outre.But the Jane I'm talking about is Jane Tennyson, the riveting detective in Britain's Prime Suspect series. I think the Elisabeth Moss detective could eventually be trotted out again in another case. That might not be a good idea, as that might threaten the relationship that develops in this series, a gorgeous romance. But for my money, the character is one of the first interesting female detectives in a long time. Apparently, no one seems to know how to do them like those from the British empire.Interestingly, Moss is an American; I can't tell if she has any ties to New Zealand. Yet she seems to have a flawless accent, or, that is, she delivers her take on it flawlessly; her lines are not self conscious, they just flow from whatever this accent is that she has developed. It would be interesting to know how many of the other actors don't have natural New Zealand accents, or some history with them ... a quick trip to IMDB could solve that, of course, but these days, it seems you don't have to be British or Australian, or American, or even a native speaker of English, to work all over the globe. Moss, the secretary-turned-copywriter in Madmen with the improbable hairdo, really gets to let her hair down here.

Her role in this film is terrific, in fact it s so good, she should be nominated for an Emmy. From the first confusing episode to the last, I was hooked! This is one of the better mini-series I have seen.'Top of the Lake ' is a seven-hour miniseries from filmmaker Jane Campion. Elisabeth Moss is a troubled Sydney cop investigating the disappearance of a pregnant 12-year-old in her small New Zealand hometown. This is a crime series concerned with heartbreak.  Moss's detective Robin Griffin is investigating the disappearance of Tui. Her father is Matt Mitcham, played by Peter Mullan, a Scotsman introduced as a villain. He is a drug taker, maker and rounder and owns the town.There's a lake where the mountains should be, and green, green grass. Everything is topsy-turvy: An unborn baby is called a ""time bomb,"" a gentle elder-care companion puts his fist through a wall. And around the investigation is a group of scarred women camped out on land called Paradise. Holly Hunter's GJ, gives advice, sips soup and drops truth bombs.This is a police procedural like no other. The only ethical investigator, it seems is Elizabeth Moss's character.

I was particularly struck by the heroine Robin Griffin, played by Elizabeth Moss, who returns to the environment where she experienced a horrific personal event. While dealing with her mom's terminal illness, she becomes obsessed with the case of Tui, the young pregnant girl, who disappears.  We begin to see connections with Robin's personal history as the story slowly unfolds, revealing increasingly sordid and disturbing elements. She reconnects with someone from her past and their relationship, as it ebbs and flows, is fully realized, deeply intimate and completely believable. Robin's scenes with her mother are very nuanced and speak to the complexities of their relationship. The New Zealand location itself - the shots of mountains, forests, lakes and rivers - is a major element of the story telling.  In watching this series, you are repeatedly shocked by the contrast between the beautiful natural landscape and the horrific nature of the human landscape.Less compelling for me was the Holly Hunter character, GJ, the spiritual leader of a group of woman camping out in storage containers by the lake shore. I assume we're supposed to see GJ literally as a healer, philosopher, guru, whatever and not as a caricature. However, every time she appeared, I felt the energy draining from the story, and her matter of fact pronouncements came across as parody. The guitar girl (you'll know her when you see her) gets too much screen time.The plot takes some twists and turns that verge on the gothic/baroque. However, for me the overall experience of watching this series was fantastic. I was totally riveted by the story and the story-telling.
