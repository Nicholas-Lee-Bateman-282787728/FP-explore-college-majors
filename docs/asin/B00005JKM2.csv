588437,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JKM2,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","You can place this in the `hidden gems' file, for `The Salton Sea', while not perfect, is one intriguing and worthwhile ride that you may never take.  It's one of the better films you've never heard of.  I remember finding this in Blockbuster back in 02 and wondering just what it was, seeing the names Val Kilmer and Vincent D'Onofrio and saying ""I'll give it a try"" and being totally blown away.  I think I watched it a record seven times before bringing it back (I kept bringing it to every friend I had and watching it with them...I was seventeen had nothing better to do with my time).Is it the best movie ever?No.  In fact, as you can see, I don't even give it an A rating, but this film is engaging, wonderfully acted, crisply shot and all around very entertaining.Kilmer (underrated as an actor and really needs to challenge himself with worthy material) plays Danny Parker, a musician haunted by the death (brutal murder) of his wife.  Since her death he has sunk into a morbid depression and become wrapped up in a life of drugs.  This life throws him into the company of some eclectic individuals, all of which play a central part in bringing him closer to his goal; vengeance.So, as I stated in my previous review (for `Flightplan'), I am dedicating my next few reviews to one of my favorite actors; Peter Sarsgaard.  This is not one of his best roles, but it is one of the first of his I had seen.  I had seen `Boys Don't Cry' but I didn't even really know who `he' was at that point and focused mainly on Swank and Sevigny (although over time Sarsgaard's performance has really stood out as utter brilliance).  Sarsgaard delivers a charmingly docile performance here as Jimmy, Danny's clingy friend.  He's nave and goofy and sad in a way, but totally likable.  He is overshadowed by Kilmer's eerily desperation (one of his finest performances) and D'Onofrio's stellar Pooh-Bear (this character is so out there yet so marvelously delivered), but Sarsgaard is most certainly memorable here.Director D.J. Caruso is the biggest star here, for it is his grungy direction that really elevates this film and gives it a crisp edge that makes us sit up in rapt attention.  The film is incredibly murky, and that works, for it `takes us there'.It's funny because this is not a film I'd consider to be superb, but it is a film that I will never forget.  The gimmicky aspects of the film work extra hard at creating a finished product you want to like, and so you wind up liking it.  I still have the `skull rings' I bought after watching Kilmer's stellar performance, and this films title proved to be the inspiration for a song I wrote when a close friend lost his wife to a horrible car accident.`The Salton Sea'; it just has a devastatingly pure ring to it.",4,"Like a serious mind tweak, this film is unforgettable...",1257292800,"11 4, 2009",2009,2763,"['can', 'place', 'hidden', 'gems', 'file', 'Salton', 'Sea', 'not', 'perfect', 'one', 'intriguing', 'worthwhile', 'ride', 'may', 'never', 'take', 'one', 'better', 'films', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'remember', 'finding', 'Blockbuster', 'back', '02', 'wondering', 'just', 'what', 'was', 'seeing', 'names', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'saying', ""'ll"", 'give', 'try', 'being', 'totally', 'blown', 'away', 'think', 'watched', 'record', 'seven', 'times', 'bringing', 'back', 'kept', 'bringing', 'friend', 'had', 'watching', 'was', 'seventeen', 'had', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'time', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'No', 'fact', 'can', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'give', 'A', 'rating', 'film', 'engaging', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'crisply', 'shot', 'around', 'very', 'entertaining.Kilmer', 'underrated', 'actor', 'really', 'needs', 'challenge', 'worthy', 'material', 'Danny', 'Parker', 'musician', 'haunted', 'death', 'brutal', 'murder', 'wife', 'death', 'sunk', 'morbid', 'depression', 'become', 'wrapped', 'up', 'life', 'drugs', 'life', 'company', 'eclectic', 'individuals', 'play', 'central', 'part', 'bringing', 'closer', 'goal', 'vengeance.So', 'stated', 'previous', 'review', 'Flightplan', 'am', 'dedicating', 'next', 'few', 'reviews', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'one', 'first', 'had', 'seen', 'had', 'seen', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'know', 'who', 'was', 'point', 'focused', 'mainly', 'Swank', 'Sevigny', 'time', 'Sarsgaard', 'performance', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'utter', 'brilliance', 'Sarsgaard', 'charmingly', 'docile', 'performance', 'here', 'Jimmy', 'Danny', 'clingy', 'friend', 'nave', 'goofy', 'sad', 'way', 'totally', 'likable', 'overshadowed', 'Kilmer', 'eerily', 'desperation', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', ""D'Onofrio"", 'stellar', 'Pooh-Bear', 'character', 'so', 'out', 'there', 'yet', 'so', 'marvelously', 'delivered', 'Sarsgaard', 'most', 'certainly', 'memorable', 'here.Director', 'D.J', 'Caruso', 'biggest', 'star', 'here', 'grungy', 'direction', 'really', 'film', 'crisp', 'edge', 'sit', 'up', 'rapt', 'attention', 'film', 'incredibly', 'murky', 'funny', 'not', 'film', ""'d"", 'consider', 'be', 'superb', 'film', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'gimmicky', 'aspects', 'film', 'work', 'extra', 'hard', 'creating', 'finished', 'product', 'want', 'like', 'so', 'wind', 'up', 'liking', 'still', 'have', 'skull', 'rings', 'bought', 'watching', 'Kilmer', 'stellar', 'performance', 'films', 'title', 'proved', 'be', 'inspiration', 'song', 'wrote', 'when', 'close', 'friend', 'lost', 'wife', 'horrible', 'car', 'accident.', 'Salton', 'Sea', 'just', 'devastatingly', 'pure', 'ring']",The Salton Sea

I used to be a big fan of Val Kilmer until he turned into Marlon Brando, not only did his bloated body and even more over blown ego ruin his once great carrier but the poor acting he had gotten into really ticked me off. So I see the once in shape Val in this movie and I think wow this must be a old movie after all Val still has that huge tumor hanging off his left elbow like he did in the movie ""HEAT"" and has not chubed up yet. Any way the movie sports a 2002 listing and that suits me fine, but it did feel dated or just like it was from 1985 or so with the punk look and all. The story is pretty tight and the movie moves right along with this kick butt cast of misfits.

588440,A1EI65WJC85U68,B00005JKM2,"BD Ashley ""vidiot_y2k""","[4, 21]","Produced by Frank Darabont and ER's Eriq La Salle. This film noir stars Val Kilmer as a tattooed dope fiend who may be a nark for the LAPD, but then again he might not be. Why should we care?As soon as Kilmer begins his opening narrative, you know you're not going to be seeing another SUNSET BLVD. THE SALTON SEA is stylishly shot; but then again, it wouldn't be film noir if it didn't LOOK good would it?Early on a junkie nearly shoots a spear gun through Kilmer's eye. If only he'd gone through with it we'd all have been spared THE SALTON SEA. Even if you manage to watch the entire 100 minutes, you won't gain your sealegs. This isn't quite as mind numbingly awful as FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS, but it comes close.Even though the make-up department may be able to paint convincing tattoos on Kilmer's back they can't disguise the fact that the man is (still) a lousy actor. Dear God. Save us from more movies this awful. The DVDs extras includes interviews with the cast and crew praising this mind numbing travesty of celluloid. For those of you who are now bored senseless, let's recap the movies' supposed plot. Val Kilmer may (or may not) be an LAPD nark. Try writing a thesis on this one.

588442,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00005JKM2,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[2, 5]","Meet Danny Parker, a ""tweaker"". Tweakers are meth users who spend their lives on the highest of highs, and Danny seems to fit in comfortably with his fellow druggies. But when Danny returns to his small apartment, he pulls down a secret case from his closet and puts on the clothes he finds in it. And there's a trumpet in there, too, that he plays beautifully. Danny is now Tom Van Allen. Wait. Is that right? Or is it the other way around? And why does this guy seem to have two distinctive personalities?As the story of Danny/Tom unravels, we get to see him meeting with two detectives who use him as a snitch. But as the film continues its seemingly normal route, we suddenly begin to see some side-roads from Danny's life. His wife was killed during a supposed turf war between drug dealers (she just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time), and Danny had to watch helplessly as she was executed; a scene that Danny plays over and over again in his mind and dreams. So why has Danny become a meth user when it was a portion of this lifestyle that caused his wife's death?Revenge perhaps?******************************************************************************Although sounding cliche-ish (i.e., murdered wife's husband seeks retribution for her death), nothing about this film is a cliche. The way the story slowly comes into focus is quite stunning. And Val Kilmer's performance is his best since Doc Holiday in ""Tombstone"".The viewer knows nothing about Danny's past initially, nor why his wife was killed, but as that thread of the story gets woven into the plot, another thread suddenly appears ...and then another, and another, and another. Amazing.The all-star cast also adds weight to the film as we get to see Vincent D'Onofrio (Full Metal Jacket) play Pooh Bear, a dealer who's done so much meth that he no longer has a nose and who's mind is so far gone that he likes to reenact the assassination of JFK using pigeons strapped into radio controlled toy cars. And Meat Loaf even makes a brief appearance! I hadn't seen him in years! I used to love his music!This film is definitely something for film noir fans to watch. It seems like a dark subject and, to some extent, it is. But not completely.Can Danny/Tom become one man again? Or, perhaps, become an entirely new man? Or will he burn in the flames of his own making?

588446,A3E7ZFQNJ47XB7,B00005JKM2,Brooser Bear,"[1, 5]","This film intrigued me, because I thought that it would be something like Lost Highway or 8mm. I was disappointed Salton Sea lacks the surrealism and the strangeness of David Lynch or the dark territory of 8mm. This film is similar in scope and vision to Remains of the Day, starring another young actor, Balthasar Getty. You will either like or dislike these two films for the same reasons.Both films are more artsy than they are real, and Salton Sea is self-consciously so. Every woman looks like a supermodel, and all three of the female characters either get abused or murdered. The drug induced madness in this film is more theatrically Shakespearean than realistic, as is violence, with characters asking existential answers and giving tough guy answers as they try to whack each other with guns. The film deals with Meth scene and speed freaks, and yet we see no raves or bikers, genuine or not, except an Easy Rider style fellow who cooks himself accidentally while cooking the next. Despite the film's shortcomings, the villains are credibly evil and realistically portrayed. Onofrio's performance as a Man Without A Nose is funny and in a couple of skits the film repeats the skits of Oliver Stone and Hannibal Lector. The film's attitude to realism is best reflected in its portrayal of this Man Without Nose drug dealing character, aka Pooh Bear. In real life there is a biker who lost a part of his nose in a bad highway accident, recovered and went on to become the president of his motorcycle club. In this film the guy loses his nose to an uncontrolled drug habit, life is negative enough, why degrade greatness?Val Kilmer's sidekick is improbable as a crack head with a heart of gold. The guy is supposed to be both - loyal, trusting, good natured, AND beholden to a crack pipe at the same time. Anybody who personally knows a current or recovering drug addict will not buy it.

He has been called less than that in so many ways and yet he proves himself time and again in movies like ""The Salton Sea"". Personally I like him and think a person sure of themselves will always get the envy of others and so I think the disparaging remarks about him only reflect that. This movie was well written and directed and only an actor of Val Kilmer's caliber could pull it off without making it seem another inept rehash ofTrafficor some other drama about a person's life turned upside down.The story is centered around a man looking for the killers that murdered his wife while they were lost near the Salton Sea. He goes undercover as a civilian with another identity and dives into the life of drug users known as tweakers. He follows clues to link her murder to the right two men that think they are above the law. The characters he meets along the way are extremely believable thanks to an excellent support cast and exceptional script. I love Kilmer's narration throughout and truly appreciated the smattering of humor thrown in to lighten the mood of this often dark story.After viewing this I immediately ordered it and I can not say the same for the majority of tragic dramas.

Both films attempt to be modern noir films, & in both films Kilmer plays a character that has 2 sides to his persona. In The Salton Sea he portrays a dual character Danny Parker/Tom Van Allen. The former is a crystal meth dealer & the latter a jazzman. The film is a stylistic masterpiece that is every bit the equal of the far more lauded Memento- a similar story about a troubled man searching for himself & the truth to his wife's death. Kilmer sinks into the role of Tom, as an avenging husband whose wife was brutally killed by 2 gunmen near the Salton Sea. Tom decides to become Danny, & work with 2 crooked undercover cops (Doug Hutchison and Anthony LaPaglia) to expose the drug cartel he believes is responsible for his wife. Along the way he encounters 1 of the great modern onscreen personifications of evil- a drug dealer named Pooh-Bear (Vincent D'Onofrio) who wears a fake nosepiece because his real nose was burnt off by cocaine use. Along with Daniel Day Lewis's Bill the Butcher in Gangs Of New York, Pooh-Bear is one of those cartoony villains that nevertheless seems to be just real enough to lift the whole of the story beyond standard noir. The real forces Tom contends against in the film are almost surreal as the cinematography & Danny's hallucinations. Pooh-Bear's idea of fun is eating brains, staging the JFK assassination with pigeons and a mini-car set, & threatening Danny with having his gonads eaten by a badger.Director D.J. Caruso and screenwriter Tony Gayton do a fine job of creating a world that Kilmer's dual personae feel right at home with. He seems to die several times, only to wake up back in his hell. The film is shot surreally, with low angles, frames just off-center, & flashbacks & dreams that happen in odd places- even in the barrel of a pistol. But what lifts this film to true greatness, like Memento, is Kilmer's performance. His blend of fear, weariness, & bravado echoes back to his work in The Doors, yet surpasses it because this character is his total creation, not a recitation of a real figure.",4,Good,1221868800,"09 20, 2008",2008,2244,"['Recently', 'watched', 'DVDs', '2', 'latest', 'films', 'Kilmer', 'canon-', 'portrayal', 'man', 'mission', 'Salton', 'Sea', 'portrayal', 'porno', 'king', 'Johnny', 'Wadd', 'Holmes', 'Wonderland', 'films', 'attempt', 'be', 'modern', 'noir', 'films', 'films', 'Kilmer', 'character', '2', 'sides', 'persona', 'Salton', 'Sea', 'dual', 'character', 'Danny', 'Parker/Tom', 'Van', 'Allen', 'former', 'crystal', 'meth', 'dealer', 'latter', 'jazzman', 'film', 'stylistic', 'masterpiece', 'bit', 'equal', 'far', 'more', 'lauded', 'Memento-', 'similar', 'story', 'troubled', 'man', 'searching', 'truth', 'wife', 'death', 'Kilmer', 'role', 'Tom', 'avenging', 'husband', 'wife', 'was', 'brutally', 'killed', '2', 'gunmen', 'Salton', 'Sea', 'Tom', 'become', 'Danny', 'work', '2', 'crooked', 'undercover', 'cops', 'Doug', 'Hutchison', 'Anthony', 'LaPaglia', 'expose', 'drug', 'cartel', 'responsible', 'wife', 'way', '1', 'great', 'modern', 'onscreen', 'personifications', 'evil-', 'drug', 'dealer', 'named', 'Pooh-Bear', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'who', 'fake', 'nosepiece', 'real', 'nose', 'was', 'burnt', 'off', 'cocaine', 'use', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'Bill', 'Butcher', 'Gangs', 'New', 'York', 'Pooh-Bear', 'one', 'cartoony', 'villains', 'nevertheless', 'be', 'just', 'real', 'enough', 'lift', 'whole', 'story', 'standard', 'noir', 'real', 'forces', 'Tom', 'film', 'are', 'almost', 'surreal', 'cinematography', 'Danny', 'hallucinations', 'Pooh-Bear', 'idea', 'fun', 'eating', 'brains', 'staging', 'JFK', 'assassination', 'pigeons', 'mini-car', 'set', 'threatening', 'Danny', 'having', 'gonads', 'eaten', 'badger.Director', 'D.J', 'Caruso', 'screenwriter', 'Tony', 'Gayton', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'creating', 'world', 'Kilmer', 'dual', 'personae', 'feel', 'right', 'home', 'die', 'several', 'times', 'only', 'wake', 'up', 'back', 'hell', 'film', 'shot', 'surreally', 'low', 'angles', 'frames', 'just', 'off-center', 'flashbacks', 'dreams', 'happen', 'odd', 'places-', 'even', 'barrel', 'pistol', 'what', 'film', 'true', 'greatness', 'Memento', 'Kilmer', 'performance', 'blend', 'fear', 'weariness', 'bravado', 'back', 'work', 'Doors', 'yet', 'character', 'total', 'creation', 'not', 'recitation', 'real', 'figure']",The Salton Sea

Vincent D'Onofrio is absolutely terrifying as Pooh Bear, a drug dealer who lost his nose from imbibing in his own product.

Val Kilmer plays Danny, a speed freak, whom we meet as he plays the trumpet and a building burns down around him. There is a bit of a monologue asking for the audience to hear how it all come to this, and the rest of the film is played out in a series of flashbacks and dream sequences.Kilmer is a little bit too old to play this role, but as usual, he does an excellent job with his part despite standing out like a sore thumb in the crowd of young tweakers. His supporting cast is good, and of special note are Peter Sarsgaard (as Jimmy the Finn - his performance is absolutely spot-on) and Vincent D'Onofrio (as Pooh-Bear - you'd almost never know it was him, so convincing is his performance.)There are some movies, such as ""Trainspotting,"" which transport the viewer into the mind of a drug addict so completely that one might feel unsettled, and even a little high. ""The Salton Sea,"" while beautifully directed, is not one of these films - one local viewer quoted ""it was kind of just like watching a bunch of drug addicts."" I feel it was much more than this, though, because as the movie plays out, we realize this is more than Just Another Druggie Story, and the fact that we're not drawn into the drug experiences is just fine. As layers of the film unfold, we learn of quite a few surprises - why Danny/Tom is a tweaker, why we only see his wife in his hallucinations and dreams, why he has a tattoo of the Salton Sea on his back, how and why he became involved with the police to begin with, and more. These are not plot twists that will leave your teeth on the floor, but they do provide interesting entertainment.All in all, this is not an outstanding movie, nor is it an amazing movie...but it *is* a very beautiful movie with strong elements. I'd imagine that it would have played better on the big screen than on television, simply because the gorgeous scenery would have been, well, bigger.

(His oft-praised performance of Jim Morrison in The Doors, a terrible movie, was nothing more than a buffoonish caricature.) Unsure of his identity and at times even the real motives behind his actions, he plays a man whose life has fallen apart.  While critics have taken numerous and well written wizzes on the film for it's postmodern, Tarantino-esque attitude toward drugs and violence, I think this has been focused on too heavily.  The movie has a flavor all it's own, one of mystery and how a man reacts when what he loves is taken away forever.  Danny Parker, haunted drug addict and truly frightening individual, is juxtaposed with former musician and husband Thomas Van Allen.  It is safe to say that Danny has taken over when the film begins.Giving an amusing history of methamphetamine, Danny asks the viewer to help him discover who he is and follow him in what will eventually become a path of revenge.  And when the revenge does come, it is both vicious and unforgiving.  The ending, despite trying to appear upbeat (perhaps in a last ditch attempt to not depress the softer viewer's to death), is actually fairly sad. Although I will not reveal any of the plot twists (and one is more important than any of the others), one has to ask oneself what is left for Danny/Tom at the end of the film.  An unforgettable movie, one that will haunt your dreams.

It starts out as another brainless drug movie but once it's over I had to admit that I jsut saw a very good movie. It makes you think Val Kilmer's character is a drugged out loser in the beginning. When he's a really musician looking for revenge on a Narc that killed his wife.Val Kilmer is just great as a sad guy trieing to find himself while looking for vengeance. This movie really deserved more exposure than it got. Kilmer gets ignored when he gives great performances. You hear about him more when directors complain about how hard he is to work with though. He deserved an oscar nomination for Tombstone and deserved one here as well but of course he didn't get it. Vincent D'Onofrio is good as a crazed speed dealer named pooh bear as well. He's a bit over the top though. He seems more like someone that would fit in a Hannibal Lector movie. He lost his nose due to snorting too much and he wears this rubber nose that reminded me of Dan Akroyd in Nothing But Trouble. A lot people just talked about who seen the film when Kilmer's performance deserved all the talk. D-Onofrio is great at playing nutty characters, he's good here but his character is more gross and even sort of more annoying than he is interesting. I liked the character but didn't think he really belonged in this movie. Seems more like he'd be someone related to Leather Face in a Chainsaw Masacre movie.Anyway some might get turned off by the beginning, thinking oh great just another movie with a lot of drug use. The movie is a whole lot more though. It's a bit odd but turns out to be very engaging and surprisingly touching as well so stick with it you might like it.

588475,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B00005JKM2,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[3, 7]","This scattershot film tries to fuse elements from various recent movies in an effort to outhip them all and succeeds only partially--and only because of the acting.  With a gorgeous opening image of a lone man playing trumpet surrounded on all sides by an inferno, it flashes back to a part jump-cut, part time-stretched series of voiced-over sequences all describing the life of heavily tattooed, spike-haired, nose-ringed druggies, all too old to sport their punky accoutrements, all too zonked to care.One of them is our lone trumpet player, Tom Van Allen, self-renamed Danny Parker to bury his monumental grief at the loss of his young wife, previously shot to death by a masked holdup man. And the drugs is similarly what he's sure will obliterate that sorrow.  In thrall to two nasty cops who use him as a street rat, Danny reveals his story bit by bit, while simultaneously searching for his wife's killer.On this dark road he comes across Vincent D'Onofrio's Pooh Bear, one seriously nasty piece of work--a noseless drug dealer with a Southern accent thick enough to fry corn pone right in your face. D'Onofrio here has one of his juiciest, meatiest roles and he serves it up real fine. You can practically taste his wicked glee as he proffers Danny a voracious badger in a cage whose door is about to open--while Danny's forced to take down his trousers.An early scene with one of the druggies--Adam Goldberg's hyper-maniacal Kujo--outlining a truly hilarious heist only adds to the confusion that is this film.  Yes, that's a very funny sequence--but in retrospect, why? To show druggies are people too?  No doubt.Val Kilmer as our anti-hero does a fine job, as does D'Onofrio, Debra Kara Unger as a put-upon neighbor, the always reliable Luis Guzman, and Anthony LaPaglia as one of the cops.  But while the actors all get their characters down to a Tee, so what?  The script moves too fast for its own good, kinda like it too is on the drug of choice here, speed, and when it does settle down--of sorts--it flops into a fairly formulaic, thin-skinned group of events that's long since defined the ""thriller"" genre.Without D'Onofrio, the skin would wear even thinner and a whole lot faster.  Without both him and Kilmer, no skin--just transparent 'stuff'.  Yep, the actors save this film and it's a good thing.There is such a thing as being TOO hip.  Maybe the filmmakers didn't know that.

588476,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00005JKM2,Linda Linguvic,"[40, 45]","This 2002 film is a rather weird and grotesque story set in the world of drugs. Val Kilmer is cast as a former trumpet player on a downward drug spiral.  He's a middleman dealer, a police informant and a speed freak himself.  The drug scenes are lurid and explicit.  And the violence never stops.  It's also a roller coaster ride for the audience, with a complicated plot that finally makes sense.  There are also special effects and moments to make me cringe.Vincent D'Onofrio is cast as a demented drug dealer who has lost his nose due to his habit.  He's a sadist who boasts about torturing people who have tried to scam him and he puts Val Kilmer through some horrible moments.  There's double crossing going on of course, and even triple crossing.  This makes the plot rather interesting as our perception of our hero changes as the film moves along.It's all a strange and unpleasant trip but I must give credit to fine performances and excellent and edgy directing.

588477,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JKM2,Matthew Horner,"[11, 14]","""The Salton Sea"", one of the year's most overlooked movies, is both a highly inventive thriller and very dark comedy. It's ""Memento"" meets ""Requiem for a Dream"" meets ""Pulp Fiction"". If your tastes sometimes run to the unusual and the bizarre, I highly recommend this movie.Val Kilmer, who gives the best performance of his career, is Danny Parker, AKA Tom Van Allen. We first meet Danny playing his trumpet in a room o fire. He is apparently dying. He begins to tell his tale and asks us to decide who and what he really is. As he says, nothing is as it appears to be. He is a junkie, but he wasn't when he was Tom Van Allen. Danny's world is something Tom could never have dreamed of before a tragic and unjust event derailed his life. As Tom (good, caring, gentle person), he can not find justice. As Danny Parker (drug addict, con artist, police informant), he can. For me to tell you more would spoil the plot.The scenes of Tom's unrelenting anger and sorrow are often relieved by moments of unexpected dark humor. These episodes may be a little jarring, as if the movie were uncertain as to the tone it needs to maintain, but they are perfectly in synch with the madness of Danny's world. Much of the humor is provided by the great character actor Vincent D'Onofrio.

Caruso's film takes itself absolutely seriously, despite all the way-over-the-top elements that make it impossible to digest without a joke or two for the audience's benefit. The film isn't humorless--Vincent D'Onofrio's bravura performance as drug dealer Pooh Bear is a masterpiece of black comedy--but it's humor that leaves viewers gasping for air, like the fish washed up on the shores of the eponymous California desert lake. In the ""making-of"" featurette on this DVD, Caruso explains that he wanted to do a Hitchcockian thriller, but one that allowed the actors to improvise and expand on their characters a' la Cassavetes. Unfortunately, Hitchcock and Cassavetes blend about as well as scotch and Kool-Aid. Tight directorial control was the hallmark of the Hitchcock style, and ""The Salton Sea"" ends up with too many spare parts at the end.So why do I give ""The Salton Sea"" four stars out of five? Because the Cassavetes portion of Caruso's vision pays off: the performances are brilliant. D'Onofrio is the obvious standout, but Val Kilmer also gives a rock-solid performance as a man who may or may not be Danny Parker, meth freak and police snitch, or Tom Van Allen, jazz trumpeter and recent widower. The excellence goes straight down the line with a treasure trove of great character actors including Peter Sarsgaard, Adam Goldberg, Glenn Plummer, Doug Hutchison, Anthony La Paglia, Luis Guzman and B.D.

This truly is the best Val Kilmer movie I seen, equaling his portrayal as Jim Morrison in The Doors. I enjoyed the movie because it was able to succesfully combine various styles(Black Comedy, Tragedy, Revenge, Violence, and coolness in sleek hip film making.) Now many would say that looking at these elements it can be seen as a simple Quentin Tarantino knock-off of Pulp Fiction,but that isn't the case. While there is Tarantino like-style in the movie, by no means is it a cheap rip off, Director D.J Caruso said himself that he Tarantino is not an influence. By the the last portion of the movie, many would argue that it ripped of Taxi Driver, but is it really fair to justify that claim? I think not. Just like it's not fair to say it ripped of Pulp Fiction. Hats down to Caruso, he and the cast did a terrific job of making this movie come to life. I recommend this to anyone with an open mind,likes stylish-thrillers, and likes the styles I mentioned earlier.

It ranks among the top five films I have EVER scene.  Itis chilling, riveting, shocking, and perhaps before its time.""The Salton Sea"" makes ""Blow"" and ""Traffic"" suitable for all ages...family flicks.  ""The Salton Sea"" is a sobering look deep intothe world of drugs...so deep that it brings chills to your spine...goosebump city.  Val Kilmer says it all in one of the openingscenes: ""You finally hit bottom and can't go any lower.""  This film can't get any higher on my list.  It is simply a gem...amasterpiece.  Val Kilmer has never been better, even though I thought he was incredible in ""The Doors"" and ""Tombstone"".So what's the story all about?  It's all about Val Kilmer...the many faces of VK...who portrays a ""Tweeker"" (you'll have to see themovie to understand).  He hangs with other tweekers, loakers and slammers.The shock value alone is worth the one hour and 43 minutes of gripping entertainment.  The sound is superb.  You must watch thiswith a good sound system...on at least a 25-inch screen.  This DVD is of the highest quality.  I wish I had seen it in the theatre, but to be honest, I didn't even knowit was released back in April.  I stumbled across it by searching the net for other films, and when I read the reviews on Amazon.Com, I knew it would be my type of flick.It is definitely not for the squeamish.  It is violent, graphic, lots of language...and the sound effects and soundtrack is ascompelling as the unique camera angles and editing.Trust me, I've seen thousands of films in my life and you can't miss this one.  Buy it.  It's a gold mine and one you will watch again and again.""The Salton Sea"" is filled with love, hate, compassion, friendship, betrayal, soul, revenge...REALITY.  There are moments thatremind me of such flicks as ""Blow"", ""Natural Born Killers"", ""Insomnia"", the drug scene in ""Traffic"", ""The Doors""...etc.  But thisfilm makes them look like babies.  ""The Salton Sea"" is a new genre of film.  It rests alone on my list in a place that no film hasever gone before.  Val Kilmer is a genius.

Sometimes it seemed to make sense to me and other times it didn't. There were moments that really connected with me and others that simply seemed off kilter. Some of the characters were pretty wacked out to say the least. I both liked that aspect and somehow despised it at the same time. Other members in their reviews commented on how good Kilmer was, and that this might be his finest performance. I totally disagree with them. Maybe those people didn't see him as Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone's film The Doors. That still remains his finest performance as far as I am concerned. That being said his performance here is understated but genuinely respectable. Understated was the best course for Kilmer to take for this sort of role. Over all I only sort of liked this film.. There was an obvious comparison between this film and Trainspotting, which was a film I absolutely hated, and I frankly don't care for films like it. But this film was one I could sit through and find something to appreciate in it, however vague that something might have been. Over all an interesting film, but not one I would want to see again or would particularly recommend.

588490,A2H9UO8RYFX5MB,B00005JKM2,"Rich Stoehr ""Idle Rich""","[10, 10]","The best thing about &quot;The Salton Sea&quot; is that it isn't what one might expect. What starts out as yet another film detailing the aspects of a heavy drug user's life - something like &quot;Blow&quot; or &quot;Trainspotting&quot; or &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; - becomes quite something else by the end of the film. Mind you, I don't have any problem with these types of films, and the ones I just mentioned are all quite good in their own right. It bears pointing out, however, that &quot;The Salton Sea&quot; is not trying to be one of those movies, which goes to its credit.And yet, drug use definitely forms a large aspect of the story of the film. In its depiction of drug use and drug users, it is remarkably balanced. It neither condemns nor glorifies it characters for their addiction, it simply portrays them honestly, as part of a larger story. Most films seem which involve a heavy dose of drug use in their story seem to feel the need to moralize on the subject at some point, but The Salton Sea avoided that particular pitfall.Most likely this is because, as the filmmakers doubtless realized early on, it's not a movie about drug use. Though it has that feeling to it early on, the story slowly turns to the history of the main character, why he is in the situation he finds himself, and what he's doing now that he's there. Through a number of fairly surprising twists and turns, we learn that all is not as it seems, both for him and for those around him. The ending, when it comes, is one of the nicest surprises of the film, even as it is its most heart-wrenching moment.Val Kilmer, who always seems to crop up in the oddest places, surprised me yet again with his lead role in this movie. He was compelling and convincing in all aspects of his portrayal, and his narrating voice throughout the film served as a unifying factor. Though I would have been hard-pressed to imagine him in this sort of role before, I now find it hard to imagine it played as well by anyone but him. Then there's Vincent d'Onofrio, who seems to have no end to his versatility. The first time I saw him was in &quot;Strange Days,&quot; as one of the corrupt policemen in that movie. I remember how he, without much help from makeup or effects, really scared me by the end of that film. These days, he shows up in many diverse roles, from a good cop in &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; to a psycho freak in &quot;The Cell&quot; to Hunter Thompson's outrageous cohort Lazlo in &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.&quot; Even with all of this in mind, d'Onofrio's role in &quot;The Salton Sea&quot; is perhaps his strangest yet. As a drug dealer who frequently samples his own product, and has suffered obvious damage to his nose as a result, d'Onofrio employs a number of disturbing quirks and idiosyncrasies in his character that make him almost unrecognizable. I had to wait until the end of the film, when I saw the credits, to be sure that it was him. A talented actor in almost anything, this is probably his most disturbing role to date, putting me in mind of Gary Oldman's part in &quot;L&eacute;on&quot; - a high compliment, since I consider that to be one of Oldman's standout roles.A note on the music for the film: it is yet another example of why I've become such a huge follower of Thomas Newman's scores in a relatively short time. A composer of rare talent, Newman seems to be, like a chameleon, capable of suiting his work perfectly to almost any type of story. From the swelling, moody strings of &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; to the quiet modern sensibility of &quot;American Beauty&quot; to the classic sweeping drama of &quot;Meet Joe Black,&quot; Newman's versatility as a composer seems almost limitless, and yet his scores are almost universally enjoyable. &quot;The Salton Sea&quot; is no exception to this rule. Newman's music establishes the film's identity, and changes suitably as the story changes. Complex themes and subtle variations highlight the score throughout, and yet never distracts the viewer from the story itself. Unlike John Williams or similar composers, Newman never feels the need to announce his music's presence. Rather, it complements the film and enhances the overall experience. From the contemporary stylings of the early part of the film to the softer, heartbreaking strains of its climax, Newman's score for &quot;The Salton Sea&quot; remains one of the high points of the film throughout.I think what I appreciated most about &quot;The Salton Sea&quot; was that it defied expectations in many ways. From a perspective of acting, or story, or character development, nothing turns out quite the way I thought it would at the beginning of the film. The performances, in many ways, are not what we expect from the actors chosen for the movie. It doesn't moralize or pass judgment on its subject matter, but lets the audience draw their own conclusions about some pretty controversial things, from drug use to the concept of revenge. While I wouldn't say that it's a film that I'll want to watch over and over again, it's definitely a movie that's worth seeing, probably more than once.",4,"A thoughtful, eloquent, surprising

588491,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005JKM2,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 3]","The Salton Sea (D. J. Caruso, 2002)It took me a while to get round to seeing this movie, and I regret that now. For some reason, there was about a five-year stretch where neo-noir was huge in Hollywood (blame Fargo, I guess), and then they just stopped coming. With a few exceptions that pretty much everyone ignored, The Salton Sea being one of them. This is a travesty, because The Salton Sea manages to avoid a lot of the cookie-cutter noir trappings from which so many of those films suffered from. I grant you, I'm not saying it's anything original. No noir film is, or it wouldn't be noir. But it stays firmly in the present in its sensibilities, rather than either being a period piece or being set in the middle of nowhere so it can act like a period piece (viz. U-Turn or the aforementioned Fargo). Caruso also roped a stellar cast into this project and got top-notch performances out of the lot, and that's often what makes the difference between a Sunset Blvd. and a [insert generic fifties noir no one, including you, remembers anymore].Danny Parker (Val Kilmer) is a jazz trumpeter who also happens to be a crystal meth addict. He developed the addiction after the untimely death of his wife. As we open, we have no idea what killed her, or why, only that Danny's life is a pretty ugly mess. He hangs around with a similar batch of meth addicts, but the only one who he can really consider a friend is Jimmy (Peter Sarsgaard). We quickly find out... oh, hell, I can't tell you that. Everything after the first five minutes of this movie is spoilersville. It's not that the plot is terribly complex, but it's terribly linear--this isn't one of those mysteries where you get dropped a piece of information, and then everyone assumes you forget it until miss Marple is in the drawing room. When Danny finds something out, he immediately uses it. Tony Gayton's screenplay approaches the doling out of information to the viewer the same way. When you get something, you can immediately paste it into the bigger picture the movie is drawing for you. (This is by design, as Danny challenges you to figure out who he is, and why he's playing a trumpet in a burning room, in the opening scene of the film.)I vaguely remember the critical reaction to The Salton Sea being lukewarm. I'm hoping that my memory is, as usual, less than reliable, `cause this movie has, and delivers, the goods.

The plot, admittedly, is pretty vanilla - Val Kilmer's wife has been killed, he seeks revenge, yawn - but the performances are so mesmerizing that you completely forget that you've seen this movie before.  D.J. Caruso, in what is probably the best first film I've seen since Bottle Rocket, manages to instill the movie with a crazy visual sensibility a la Snatch, or From Hell, but keeps the characters from getting lost in the slo-mo dolly shots and visual trickery.  The best reason for this success is Val Kilmer.  I'd say ""performance of a lifetime,"" but this man has given so many performances of a lifetime that it's almost standard to see him light up the screen.  Nevertheless, he makes the movie, along with Vincent D'Onofrio, who has more fun than should be allowed playing a no-nosed junkie with a pet badger named Captain Steubing.  The dialogue would sound hackneyed from the mouth of a lesser actor, but Kilmer makes it so moving that one is almost sorry when the film is over.  Go watch this.

He used to be Tom Van Allen, before the death of his wife in an unrelated drug raid near the Salton Sea.  From Tom the trumpet player to Danny the addict, Danny's downward spiral has had a purpose.With a single piece of evidence from the murder of his wife, a red hair, Tom/Danny has planned revenge for a long time based on a single vision of a person at a gas station.  He intends to trap the red-haired stranger in a quarter-million dollar drug deal with a psycho called Pooh-Bear.I don't want to say much more, which would reveal too much of the plot, but I will say that this film relies on atmosphere, photography, great acting, and visuals rather than script.  I felt the script was the weakest part, but the rest of its components compelled me towards its rather predictable ending.  It's a bit twisted and unleveled, but in the end that works for the movie rather than against it.Val Kilmar (Willow, Alexander, Wonderland) is good in his role, as he always is, but Vincent D'Onofrio (Men In Black, The Cell) steals the show as Pooh-Bear.  D'Onofrio was meant to play the bad parts, evidenced by his ability to carry the movie, 'The Cell', all on his own (Lopez made the movie worse, not better).  Peter Sarsgaard (Shattered Glass, The Cell) carries his share of the weight in this flick just as he did with D'Onofrio in The Cell.  These two actors obviously work well together.  Look for singer Meat Loaf in an almost unrecognizable role as Bo.  B.D. Wong (Executive Decision) is at top form as his role of financer/agent Bubba.'The Salton Sea' is a good movie to flesh out your drug habit, as far as movies go, but I haven't decided whether or not it is worth a purchase yet.

The script is too complicated with flashbacks, but for all its implausible story the film is always entertaining with a clever use of the camera and some interesting (or crazy) characters that you find it funny to see, but you don't want to know personally.Standard film review requires a plot summery, but in 'The Salton Sea' it doesn't work. So I strongly advise that if you like good dialogues and unpredictable story, you should watch it without reading anything about the film including mine. I can also promise some moments of darkly funny humor and strange characters including our hero running away from his demon, plus good acting from Val Kilmer and Vincent D'Onofrio (who has no nose) and the moody photography by Amir Mokri ('Don't Say a Word' and 'Taking Lives').[MINOR SPOILERS ALERT!!!] The film is a noir mystery, which begins with Val Kilmer's character sitting on the floor, playing the trumpet somewhere in the burning house. His languid voiceover tells us about the things in the past, about the days when he was dealing with chemicals. At first the film looks like a Tarantino-style half-comic, half-serious drama about some crime. Crimes are involved, to be sure, but the film soon shows another much darker aspect.The film is partly a revenge story, but its revenge part cannot be revealed here. Apparently, the film suggests, Val Kilmer's character has one aim right ahead of him. He has a huge tatoo on his back; he keeps in touch with two guys who are not always nice to him; and he says he has two names. But his real purpose of life will not be clear until the last 30 minutes.[COMPLICATED STORY] If you dissect all the pages of the script, rearrange the parts, and see the whole thing once again, you will notice that the story itself is very implausible. The film knows it, however, and is self-conscious, even calling its own wrap-up a 'cliche.' But perhaps the mystery is not the point. It's about how to present it, and 'The Salton Sea' succeeds on that score. Its humor is sometimes excessive, or too silly -- see the ridiculous re-enactment scene of 'JFK' -- but good actors are fun to see. Besides Kilmer and D'Onofrio, Adam Goldberg, Luis Guzm&aacute;n, Deborah Kara Unger, B.D. Wong, Peter Sarsgaard, Doug Hutchison, and Anthony LaPaglia appear, with bits of R. Lee Ermey, Danny Trejo, Meat Loaf.The film is a noir, and like any noir the story is complicated and often implausible. But film is always slick and stylish, and manages to engae the fans of the genre.",4,(3.5 STARS) D. J.
