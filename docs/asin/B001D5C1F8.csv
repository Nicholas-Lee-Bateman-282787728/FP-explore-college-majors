1179251,A2WU6B7PIK7K71,B001D5C1F8,Coffee Bean,"[1, 1]","I do not hesitate to recommend this complete series to anyone who enjoys classic tv shows.  In the very first two shows, you will fall in love with all five characters:  Uncle Bill, Mr. French, Buffy, Jody and Cissy.  Then you're hooked.  Although they are a non-traditional family, the episodes focus on the love that binds them together through every situation.  Their love and consideration for each other - that's what makes them a family.  More of a family and quality show than so much of the trash that's on tv today.  It's not exactly a comedy.  There is a mix of sad, funny and sweet, so there's drama AND comedy.  Uncle Bill experiences the drama with a teenage niece that parents experience with their children, not to mention the antics of Buffy and Jody and the growing adoration between Mr. French and the children.  There's always a happy ending, but isn't that what we love to see?  After watching the complete series, I am ready to watch it again.  The DVDs are crystal clear, the color is great, and at the end of each season, there is bonus material with Kathy Garver and other actors and actresses who guest-starred on the show.  It's fun to see the furnishings and fashion of the day, not to mention rotary phones and transistor radios!  No cell phones!  Even if you're an adult, as I am, don't hesitate to purchase this wonderful series.  It's great for adults and kids alike.

As time goes by, the more I question the value of portraying gritty reality. These shows show you a world that you're already thoroughly acquainted with, a world that almost always leaves you feeling frustrated, unsatisfied, and hopeless. And these shows make you feel frustrated, unsatisfied, and hopeless.What if you were to look at the so-called wholesome shows as a call to hold yourself to higher standards, behavior-wise, attitude-wise, and otherwise? People scoff at stuff like Family Affair. But try and hold yourself to the same standards for more than two or three days. Good luck with it. Is this the real reason why people knock these types of shows? Would it just take too much damn effort? Or are they fearful that it would leave them too vulnerable? People knock Family Affair for having a strong fantasy element.

1179254,A1NDYG7YCATPLD,B001D5C1F8,Gregory A. Moorehead,"[67, 69]","When it comes to old television shows, particularly family comedies, people are quick to jump to generalizations: childish, simple, one-dimensional, unrealistic are terms which come to mind. However, while on it's surface, ""Family Affair"" appears as just another late 60's family sitcom, there are some important distinctions which set it apart it from other family comedies such as ""Leave it to Beaver"", ""Father Knows Best"", ""The Brady Bunch"", etc.  First, of all ""Family Affair"" plays more like a ""dramedy"" (comedy with dramatic elements) than a traditional sitcom. In fact, there are very few comedic elements in some episodes, but always a very clear story arc.  The next issue is the matter of how the twins and Cissy, come to live with Uncle Bill.  The writers make it very clear that both parents were killed in an accident. Unlike ""The Brady Bunch"" where we know both parents are widowed, but there is never any detail regarding how the families actually come together (with all due respect to the theme song); in the first episodes of ""Family Affair"" the writers not only take a surprising amount of time to convey that the parents were killed, but also to share with the audience the difficulty the twins had adjusting to life as they were bounced from one family member to the next, often separated from their older sister, Cissy. In fact, in one early episode, Buffy runs away because she feels that Uncle Bill will also abandon them.  Next, ""Family Affair"" distinguishes itself because of the progressive and sophisticated nature of the main characters who explore relationships with indivdiuals across a diversity of backgrounds. In one episode Uncle Bill helps an African American gentlemen in his gym with the concerns he is having with his young son. In another episode the twins befriend a young girl with a disability who as the storyline implies, dies near the end of the episode. This was pretty daring for a family sitcom.  In another episode, the family hosts the financee of a Chinese gentleman, whose bride-to-be comes from China and speaks little English and knows little about American culture. In a surprising twist, the episode ends with the couple not getting married, and going their separate ways. In another episode, Buffy befriends a young girl from an impoverished background, and as the story goes, we learn that poor people can be also be classist.  ""Family Affair"" is well-written, well produced, and very entertaining. If you remember this show as a child, you should consider seeing it again as you may have missed some of the subtle themes. If you've never seen ""Family Affair"" before you may be surprised at what you're missing.",5,"""Family Affair"" Stands Apart from the Rest",1242691200,"05 19, 2009",2009,2670,"['When', 'old', 'television', 'shows', 'particularly', 'family', 'comedies', 'people', 'are', 'quick', 'jump', 'generalizations', 'childish', 'simple', 'one-dimensional', 'unrealistic', 'are', 'terms', 'come', 'mind', 'However', 'surface', 'Family', 'Affair', 'as', 'just', 'late', '60', 'family', 'sitcom', 'are', 'important', 'distinctions', 'set', 'other', 'family', 'comedies', 'such', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'Father', 'Knows', 'Best', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'etc', 'First', 'Family', 'Affair', 'more', 'dramedy', 'comedy', 'dramatic', 'elements', 'traditional', 'sitcom', 'fact', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'comedic', 'elements', 'episodes', 'always', 'very', 'clear', 'story', 'arc', 'next', 'issue', 'matter', 'how', 'twins', 'Cissy', 'come', 'live', 'Uncle', 'Bill', 'writers', 'make', 'very', 'clear', 'parents', 'were', 'killed', 'accident', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'where', 'know', 'parents', 'are', 'widowed', 'never', 'detail', 'regarding', 'how', 'families', 'actually', 'come', 'together', 'due', 'respect', 'theme', 'song', 'first', 'episodes', 'Family', 'Affair', 'writers', 'not', 'only', 'take', 'surprising', 'amount', 'time', 'convey', 'parents', 'were', 'killed', 'also', 'share', 'audience', 'difficulty', 'twins', 'had', 'adjusting', 'life', 'were', 'bounced', 'one', 'family', 'member', 'next', 'often', 'separated', 'older', 'sister', 'Cissy', 'fact', 'one', 'early', 'episode', 'Buffy', 'away', 'Uncle', 'Bill', 'will', 'also', 'abandon', 'Next', 'Family', 'Affair', 'progressive', 'sophisticated', 'nature', 'main', 'characters', 'who', 'explore', 'relationships', 'indivdiuals', 'diversity', 'backgrounds', 'one', 'episode', 'Uncle', 'Bill', 'African', 'American', 'gentlemen', 'gym', 'concerns', 'having', 'young', 'son', 'episode', 'twins', 'befriend', 'young', 'girl', 'disability', 'who', 'storyline', 'implies', 'dies', 'end', 'episode', 'was', 'pretty', 'daring', 'family', 'sitcom', 'episode', 'family', 'financee', 'Chinese', 'gentleman', 'bride-to-be', 'China', 'little', 'English', 'little', 'American', 'culture', 'surprising', 'twist', 'episode', 'couple', 'not', 'getting', 'married', 'going', 'separate', 'ways', 'episode', 'Buffy', 'young', 'girl', 'impoverished', 'background', 'story', 'learn', 'poor', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'also', 'be', 'classist', 'Family', 'Affair', 'well-written', 'well', 'produced', 'very', 'entertaining', 'remember', 'show', 'child', 'should', 'consider', 'seeing', 'again', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'subtle', 'themes', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Family', 'Affair', 'may', 'be', 'surprised', 'what', ""'re"", 'missing']",Family Affair: The Complete Series

Anissa Jones, (Buffy), we are the same age, had she lived.It does make me sad to think that only Kathy Garver and Johnnie Whitaker are still alive.  The way Brian Keith, Sebastian Cabot, and Aniss Jones died makes me sad.I do love the simple stories of Family Affair, how close Buffy and Jodie were.  I never had a brother, just 2 older sisters, who I was never close to.I do have all 5 seasons, and do wish the show wasn't cancelled, because the last show doesn't seem like a last show to me.I liked how Brian Keith and Sebastian Cabot, how the show showed their evolution from being bachelors to being such great caregivers of 3 children, who really needed a loving family, just like everyone needs and deserves to have.I find the more stressful my life becomes, the more I gravitate to these kinds of wholesome shows.Iam just so happy to have them available for purchase on dvd.I actually started at the beginning, watched the first dvd in order, and went on from there.Some shows really stuck in my mind from when I was a child, and some I didn't remember, so it was nice to see them for what seemed like for the first time.I think this would be a great dvd collection for parents and children to watch together, or for people like me who are nostalgic to see a show they remember from when they were a child, and see it from a new perspective.It's wierd, but I find that as an adult I still like some of the shows I enjoyed as a child.  Maybe people never grow up, totally.  For someone like me who never really had a childhood, I find that refreshing, if a bit odd.It's kind of sad to me with all the cable channels we have on tv today, that there is really very little great programming on tv, or any original story lines.
