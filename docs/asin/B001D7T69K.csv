They are as much fun to watch now as they were when I was 8 years old. So many of these old movies have been destroyed due to editing for tv, and many scenes are lost for ever. These four movies are as complete as I've seen. I am not a fan of colorization, but honestly, the 3 B&W; movies in this collection are enjoyable on another level. Seeing the Ymir and the Rhedosaurus in color is actually quite fun.The inclusion of the Seventh Voyage of Sinbad in this collection makes sense as it was Ray's first color feature. However, I prefer Jason and the Argonauts simply because the screenplay was better (in my opinion).If you're a sci-fi fan this is a must have.",5,A nice collection,1388102400,"12 27, 2013",2013,761,"[""'m"", 'big', 'Ray', 'Harryhausen', 'fan', 'many', 'age', 'watched', 'movies', 'over', 'child', 'are', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'now', 'were', 'when', 'was', '8', 'years', 'old', 'So', 'many', 'old', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'destroyed', 'due', 'editing', 'tv', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'lost', 'ever', 'four', 'movies', 'are', 'as', 'complete', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'colorization', 'honestly', '3', 'B', 'W', 'movies', 'collection', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'level', 'Seeing', 'Ymir', 'Rhedosaurus', 'color', 'actually', 'quite', 'fun.The', 'inclusion', 'Seventh', 'Voyage', 'Sinbad', 'collection', 'sense', 'was', 'Ray', 'first', 'color', 'feature', 'However', 'prefer', 'Jason', 'Argonauts', 'simply', 'screenplay', 'was', 'better', 'opinion', '.If', ""'re"", 'sci-fi', 'fan', 'must', 'have']",Ray Harryhausen Collection:(20 Million Miles to Earth / Earth vs. Flying Saucers / It Came from Beneath the Sea / 7th Voyage of Sinbad)
1179479,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,B001D7T69K,A. Gammill,"[28, 30]","Like all the reviewers here, I've been a fan of the fantasy film work of Ray Harryhausen since I was a kid.  Fantastic journeys with Sinbad, Jason, and others are among my fondest childhood movie memories.  But true science fiction was always my first love.  So that's why I'm so excited that, among the many great films Harryhausen worked on, EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS has finally made its way to Blu-ray.While it never makes the Top 10 list of 50's sci-fi flicks, I think it belongs there, alongside the originalThe War of the Worlds (Special Collector's Edition),Forbidden Planet [Blu-ray], andThis Island Earth.  There were other alien invasion films during the decade, but none deliver the goods like Earth vs. The Flying Saucers.  And it's not just because of the master animator's incredible effects work.  The story, though certainly dated, holds up well for what it is.  A jaded viewer will spot the cliches: Studly scientist (Hugh Marlowe) in love with the General's daugher (Joan Taylor), a military that is actually competent and helpful, and so on.  But to my mind, these are things to cherish about the film rather than being deficits.To be fair to the whole box set, ALL the movies here are great in their own way.  THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD is certainly the best of Harryhausen's trilogy of film featuring the adventure-loving sailor.  20 MILLION MILES TO EARTH features one of his earliest beloved creatures, the Ymir, and uses Italian scenery to great effect (in an interview included on the disc, Harryhausen admits he chiefly accepted the job to get a free trip to Rome!).  IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA is probably the least-known film, but holds its own against the onslaught of giant-creature flicks of the time.OK, if you're a fan, you may know all of this already.  So what about the Blu-ray discs, you say?  I own all the films on DVD (including TWO previous releases of Earth vs. The Flying Saucers...hey, I told you upfront I love that movie!), including the Legend Films colorized versions of Earth and 20 Million Miles.  And I can tell you that the improved resolution is noticeable but may NOT be enough for casual fans to upgrade.  As someone else noted, these films are pretty old.  And there's only so much you can do with them.  If by chance you don't have the DVD's, then certainly you should go straight for the Blu-ray's.  Note that each film has a wealth of supplemental materials, but these are all holdovers from the most recent DVD releases.  So the only real reason to upgrade is if you already know you love these movies, and want to see them in the highest possible resolution.Like I said, I'm a fan.  So it was worth it to me.  I've been watching these movies for almost 40 years, from staying up to watch ""All Nite Movies"" on a local channel, to currently enjoying them in true 1080p definition on a 52"" HDTV.  It's truly a movie-lovers dream come true.  Now, we just need the rest of the Harryhausen catalog released.",5,"Earth vs. The Flying Saucers in HD!

The 3 black & white films also come in a colorized version that fit the time period of these films. Watching the colorized version reminds me of watching the films back in the 70's on TV. While I usually can't stand colorization, the technique used for the 3 film seems to work.
