777734,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,B0000DBJ2C,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[13, 14]","As others have noted, both this and ""Wake of Death"" have shown a change in direction for Van Damme, choosing to delve more into complex roles, drama, and believable acting, rather than two dimensional fight movies. Not that I suspect we will be seeing him on the nomination list at the Oscars any time soon, but here again he turns in a credible performance. After being jailed for avenging his wifes murder, he is subjected to a brutal Eastern Block prison regime, where the dollar rules, the guards and warden are corrupt, and you sleep with one eye open. We see the gradual deterioration of an outwardly ""normal"" man, whose only means of survival is to become one of the cruel and violent inmates he has come to despise. The fight sequences are short, snappy, brutal and bloody (no box splits, or flying spinning back kicks here) and the viewer is immersed into the savage world of gangs, violence, and desperation. ""In Hell"" is an apt title, but the film has some surprising twists, and different outcome to what one might expect, and is well directed and well scripted throughout. Hardly an original story, but the European makeover adds another dimension to a standard prison flick of say ""Lock Up"" or many others. On the whole, I recommend this movie, and hope to see Van Damme continue to develop his characters in this way. I've always enjoyed his other, and often more aimless fight movies so felt a teeny bit agrieved at the lack of martial arts, but overall the movie is pretty darn good.

777735,A1YZMGEC9ELI4L,B0000DBJ2C,"A.P. Fuchs, author of The Axiom-man Saga ""www...","[1, 1]","Kyle's (Jean Claude Van Damme) wife is murdered and, though the culprit is caught, when the case goes to trial, there's not enough evidence to convict him. Taking matters into his own hands, Kyle kills the man himself right after and is sentenced to life in Krava prison in Russia. Once there, Kyle discovers the crooked warden hosts fighting battles on the grounds and bets with other wardens who bring fighters in from other prisons.At first content to fight, Kyle makes a name for himself as someone not be messed with, but when a close friend is killed, he decides to lower his hands and fight no longer. Following his example, the other inmates no longer fight as well, and the entire order of the prison is challenged.But one of the inmates has a secret and in order for the prison to be brought down once and for all, Kyle must step into the ring one last time.I got to say I was really impressed with this. This was the first Van Damme prison movie I've seen since Death Warrant and, frankly, had a blast watching it. This flick has a strong story and isn't your usual fair of Van Damme merely fighting and winning the ""big one"" at the end. Instead, it's the story of one man's journey to do what's right inside prison walls and learning when it's time to walk away.As for the fighting, though, yeah, much more realistic than other JCVD flicks. Lots more wrestling, arm holds, close toe-to-toe stuff, and, dare I say, didn't have a single patented Van Damme 360-kick in it. The matches were also pretty much 50-50 in terms of blows exchanged, instead of Van Damme winning all the fights until the final guy, then gets his butt beat for ten minutes, before having a big comeback where he dominates and wins (with that 360-kick). The fights in this flick were more blow-for-blow, with one guy winning after the other guy gets knocked out.I really enjoyed this, so if you're in a JCVD mood but also want a good story that sucks you in from the start, In Hell is the way to go.Recommended.A.P.

777736,A3TJJHMWV3SFNI,B0000DBJ2C,"Brett Heitkam ""DVD obsessed""","[26, 27]","In Hell is one of the best JCVD movies from his recent direct to video offerings.  In the film, he plays Kyle LeBlanc, a French-American man living and working in Russia with his American wife, who soon gets brutally murdered.  Kyle is then sent to a Russian prison after he murders the man who killed his wife.  Of course, this prison is no cakewalk...actually it makes Oswald State Prison from the HBO show ""Oz"" literally look like Disney World.  The warden and guards are all corrupt and the prisoners who have money get all the perks.  The warden also sets up a human cockfighting arena on the prison grounds where he has two prisoners fight (most of the time fight to the death) and he and his friends take bets on the winners.  Of course, JCVD sets out to make his way through this corrupt system, help his new prison friends, and get revenge for his wife's death.The film is very dark, brutal, and bloody, but it is beautifully filmed.  There is one scene in particular when Kyle is thrown in ""the hole"" for misbehaving.  In that scene, after Kyle loses hope and tries to hang himself, a moth flies down from the window/rafters above him and the camera beautifully follows it down as it flutters toward Kyle, and then it lands on the handle of the spoon that is in his untouched bowl of gruel, as if to say, ""Eat. Get stronger, and you will be able to free yourself from this place.""  I know it sounds really corny, but it is really a lovely scene and not something that you typically see in JCVD films.The DVD transfer is awesome.  Picture and sound quality are good and you get widescreen and fullscreen to choose from.Definitely a movie to see, whether you like Van Damme or not.

There's no flying and spinning around like a helicopter or exploding a stack of bricks with your big toe here.  Its all gritty realistic bloody knuckle street fighting.

He eventually owns the prison!Essentially it's a cross betweenStar Trek VI(where Kirk kicked the alien in the knee/balls), a classic episode of ""The A-Team"" where B.A. gets purposely put in a prison to uncover a warden-controlled inmate fighting scandal, a Russian version ofThe Shawshank Redemption, the concubine scenes fromConan the Barbarian, the shower scene fromVictory, and one specific scene fromInterview with the Vampire.  Just trust me.The major characters seem like a collection of mental patient professional wrestlers.  One looks like Machine from8MM(mask included), but sounds like Jodie Foster fromNell.  Another is an aggressive rapist who looks like an L.A. cholo, and forcibly sodomizes a newbie who is only kept alive to get corn-holed by fight champs.  The final oddball is Inmate 451 (Lawrence Taylor), a psychotic arsonist (Get it?!  451!?!) who murders his cellmates and waxes poetic about the morality lessons of prison, survival, and humanity.Without flying kicks and the splits, this one is less JCVD than most others.  However, it's an honest attempt by JCVD to play a role deeper than his norm.  Nonetheless, the movie incorporates the most enticing pieces of other action films, and delivers an interesting, albeit predictable plot.  By normal standards it's pretty ridiculous, but JCVD standards are different.  However, JCVD displays great range as a man who decays inside a deplorable situation, yet finds the willpower to eventually overcome adversity (especially during his completely insane moments).Highly Recommended.",4,Don't drop the soap (p.2)!

But he plays it like a normal he doesn't go for a Shakespeareian performance. It stars Jean Claude Van Damme as Kyle Le Blanc & Lawence Taylor as 451. You start off a guy has broken into Kyle LeBlanc's house his wife was killed by the burglar & Kyle shows up & finds his wife he chases after this guy. At the trial he's found innocent Kyle LeBlanc is filled with rage he shoots & kills the man who murdered his wife Kyle ends up getting sentenced to life in prison. So he was working overseas in Russia so he'll be in a prision in Russia. We are introduced to 451 & Lawence Taylor has a ton of great monologue's. There is 1 guy named Billy the jailers have this guy they like Andrei & he just has his way with Billy if you've not seen this movie you should. Kyle sees what happened to Billy & he starts a fight with Andrei which puts Kyle in solitary he tries to take his life it is a slow build to Kyle's fight with Andrei & I liked it I wasn't board with a slow pace case I'm involved with these characters & I usually don't care for the art house film making but it works. Kyle has a beard & long hair he's been in the cell for a long time he faces off with Andrei it show how Kyle LeBlanc has lost his humanity he kills Andrei just the way he does & it is well done. We got this guy in a wheel chair he told the guards that Billy was going to escape while it's probably not the right thing he did result in Billy being killed 451 burns him to death. Billy tells Kyle before he dies ""Don't let them make you something you aren't."" These fights are done for money & entertainment for jailers Generals. No matter how big the fighters The Generals bring in Kyle refuses to fight them. 451 helps Kyle escape during the riot. The prison is closed 3 months later & that's pretty much the movie. Ringo Lam did a great job directing I hear he can be a pain to work for but he can take small budget films & make them look theatrical so he's probably a PRO. I mean he made it look more theatrical than Predators & Mas hitt y which should've went direct to video.  Jean Claude Van Damme he can do drama if his ego isn't involved. Lawence Taylor did a very good job he's better than a lot of pro athletes that go into acting. I do warn you it is hardcore gorey I'm not talking about retarted  SAW BS. This is gritty if you remember that movie The Quest years ago this was what The Quest should've been. That waa directed by Van Damme & you can tell his ego was involved it wasn't good.

He's apparently passionate enough to execute his wife's killer after the courts let the killer free. Yet he comes across as a very controlled, tightly wound person. One might wonder why he didn't try to follow the killer to a less obvious venue before pulling the trigger, but apparently Kyle is overcome with loss. As a result he gets sent to an Eastern Block prison where corruption and violence are the ways of the world. In this environment, Van Damme becomes a savage. In deed, the international release is called ""The Savage."" Van Damme is put in a cell with a violent prisoner known for killing his cellmates. As played by ex-football star Lawrence Taylor, this guy is huge, speaking little but constantly writing in his journals. He establishes a strange friendship with Kyle. Kyle meantime fights for sport in prison-sponsored to-the-death matches. Particularly brutal is the neck bite attack where Kyle is transformed into a crazed killer. Van Damme is convincing as borderline insane. During his lockdowns, a butterfly that seems to be the spiritual embodiment of his dead wife comes to comfort him as he sits next to the raw sewage streaming through his cell. The film is filled with the usual prison rape and countless manners of brutality. It leads to Kyle's final escape to freedom.

777755,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B0000DBJ2C,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[2, 2]","2003 wasn't looking promising for fans of Jean-Claude Van Damme: their hero had been making direct-to-video features for the last four years, and hismost recent onewas on-par with the worst Steven Seagal offerings of the same time. Then came ""In Hell"", and their faith had reason to be restored. The movie held its own in video rentals better than any of his previous low-budget flicks, and by being such a well-made departure from typical action vehicles, it showed that Van Damme was definitely capable of furthering his image while in exile from Hollywood, rather than letting it stagnate. Though I have my issues with the film, I don't think it's farfetched to say that ""In Hell"" acted as a wake-up call to the entire DTV action industry, letting everyone know that not getting a theatrical release was not permission for a film to be technically and dramatically substandard.The story: an American living in Russia (Van Damme) is sent to one of the nation's cruelest and most corrupt prisons for killing the murderer of his wife. Inside, he is faced with the worst kind of human perversity and corruption. Pushed into fighting matches between the inmates, the biggest fight will be to retain his own humanity.I'm not at all an aficionado of prison movies, and this film is a good example of why: the human exploitation aspects which inevitably work their way into these pictures go against everything I consider entertaining in films, especially when it's done with the amount of quasi-realism you see here. The abuse of inmates by the prison guards, the repeated raping of a character played by Chris Moir (Hatchetman), and the sheer hopelessness expressed in at least the first half of the film are all hard to digest. But this film isn'tThe Shawshank Redemption, with a cast of proven actors who can manipulate me into feeling as uncomfortable as they want; no, this is a Jean-Claude Van Damme film with minimal dramatic expectations that ended up rising higher in dramatic quality than anybody could've imagined. It's unfathomable how legitimately theatrical and non-corny this movie is, especially when you consider that it's written by two newcomers to the business and doesn't star any acclaimed actors (Van Damme's immediate costar is pro football player Lawrence Taylor; even he comes off looking good). Ringo Lam, who'd doneMaximum Riskwith Van Damme, squeezes every drop of his skill as a filmmaker into this one's direction, making it feel shiningly authentic to the point of near-greatness. Yes, I'm still talking about a Van Damme movie here, but if you're looking for a vehicle of his that's approachable by non-action fans who aren't interested inJCVD, this one's it.Yes, the movie includes illegal prison fighting matches, but it's to the film's credit that these are treated in general as a side attraction while not leaving the rest of the picture wanting. However, even the fights are to Van Damme's acclaim. There's no fancy martial artistry going on here - just gritty brawling, with some kicking, a couple judo throws, and plenty of grounded wrestling. Van Damme's ventured into this style of fight choreography before, but it didn't look natural for him before now: ""In Hell"" makes Jean-Claude comfortable with a pure MMA style, and even though next to none of the fights are grade-A encounters in my book, his eventual showdown with the gigantic Michael Bailey Smith (The Hills Have Eyes) is plenty entertaining - sort of a more intense redo of the finale fromDeath Warrant.With the exception of the questionable CGI moth seen in a couple scenes, the production is impeccably slick: more than any other from the last ten years, this Van Damme picture *looks* like a Hollywood production. This rounds off one of the best-made low-budget pictures I've ever seen, and the one which I think helped begin to differentiate Van Damme from his competition at this point in his career.

While in prison, LeBlanc and the other prisoners are used for sport by the guards and prison personnel.  Prisoners fight to the death while the spectactors place bets.  For the prisoners it becomes a choice between playing the game or standing together.  For LeBlanc it's a matter of becoming what he despises.  There are many talented character actors involved.

777758,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B0000DBJ2C,Robert Badgley,"[1, 1]","Something happened to Van Damme in the new millennium which very few film goers,other than his hardcore fans,really picked up on.Many of his films became much edgier and in the last decade he has produced some of the best and more compelling films of his career;and In Hell(released June/03) is no exception.This hard edged film starring Van Damme and directed by the eccentric Ringo Lam,is their third collaboration together.The film starts out nice and easy but gets grittier and grittier as the film progresses with terribly graphic and violent action,and populated by some pretty dysfunctional characters.The plot involves Van Damme as Kyle,an American who works in Russia with a pretty wife.On his way home from work one evening while talking to his better half on the cell phone,their connection is disrupted on her end when she is confronted by an unknown assailant.Kyle hears the struggle and races through the streets to get home.He finds his wife on the floor dead and the perp still in the house.Kyle gives chase but he is cut short by the police who mistake him for the perp.They do end up catching the assailant who goes on trial for the murder of Kyle's wife,but gets off scott-free.Kyle is so despondent at the verdict that outside the courtroom he grabs a security guards gun and shoots the man dead.This leads to Kyle's trial for murder,and of course he gets sent to a Russian prison.It is a terribly tough environment for inmates in the institution and Kyle,along with other new inmates,quickly learn their place in the prison pecking order.A young man that enters with Kyle is immediately pegged as the ""pigeon"",shall we say,for one particular prisoners' ""delights"".Kyle is himself constantly picked on and more often than not,he is sent into confinement in a cold,damp cell through which the prison waste flows.He loses himself eventually,even tries to commit suicide unsuccessfully but after a few visits by a moth(who he believes is his wife),he decides to take on the prison system on its terms and begins to train to fight while in confinement and out.Fight after fight ensues and Kyle becomes the prisons favourite,bet on by all the prison staff,including the warden.When his young friend eventually succumbs to one too many ""encounters"",it wakes him up and he decides not to fight a special inmate transferred in from another prison.He is put in chains outside day and night for his disobedience and the prison inmates finally rebel and all refuse to fight.Kyle does not give in and when he is returned to his cell,his cell mate tells him he can get him out and hands him a book listing every murder that the prison staff have committed over the two decades he has been there.Kyle,in order for the escape plan to go through,must fight one more time.The warden has told his guards to kill Kyle after the fight,and when the dust settles and Kyle's nemesis is defeated,he is escorted to a large garage to be driven out of the prison.It is here his cell mate jumps one of the guards which enables Kyle to take care of the other.It's a prison staff car and he makes a clean break out of the prison.His cell mate confronts the warden,tears his tongue out and drinks the wardens blood from a decanter.Due to his diary Kyle gives to the authorities,the prison is shut down two months later.When you read this scenario you might think,oh great here's another movie where Van Damme karate chops and kicks his way through more film footage.Not the case.What makes this totally UN-Van Damme-ish is the fact that for the first 45 minutes he is constantly getting the crap beat out of him.And when he finally realizes its' better to join them than to beat them,there are few if any fancy karate kicks or spins that you usually associate with him.He's like his fellow prisoners and just uses his fists.There is a startling scene where Van Damme(with scraggy long hair,not like his usual looks),is fighting the man that not only continually hounded HIM,but constantly raped his young friend.The man has got Van Damme down and there is no way he's winning as he is being dragged around the grounds in a delirium.Just when you think the guy is going to deliver Van Damme a final blow,Van Damme pulls it out from somewhere,gets the guy down,jumps on him and chews on the guys neck.The guards pull him off and he turns over screaming with blood all over his face,as if it had brought him back to life,like a vampire.Startling and gross,yes,and doubled in impact(double impact...hmmmm)because it's again not what we expect from him.Technically speaking this DVD comes in BOTH widescreen and fullscreen,unlike the Amazon blurb which just lists fullscreen.It is also available in Dolby 2.1 or 5.1 sound,with or without subtitles.There is also a 15 minute featurette on the making of the movie.By and large the film is clear and crisp but it does at times get a bit grainy.All in all this film is one of the most Un-Van Damm-ish movies you will ever see,especially when it involves the amount of physical action this does.It starts out nice and easy but gets edgier and grittier as the film roles along with alot of ""ewww"" and turn your head moments when the action gets white hot.This is just one of many of Van Damme's better films from the last decade.He has improved so much over the years as an actor and a director.The trouble is the larger general audience seems to be oblivious to this fact.Maybe his upcoming appearance/exposure in the Expendables 2 will hopefully correct some of that.",4,A solid four stars for this ATYPICAL Van Damme feature!,1320883200,"11 10, 2011",2011,5497,"['Something', 'happened', 'Van', 'Damme', 'new', 'millennium', 'very', 'few', 'film', 'goers',

777761,ANLEL1J3ZS8YP,B0000DBJ2C,Shiloh Kremer,"[2, 2]","In his latest movies, Van Damme has shifted toward suspense and drama, which makes his characters more believable. In Hell is without a doubt one of the most tear jerking movies I have seen in a while due to Van Damme's powerful screen presence. In this movie, Van Damme slowly breaks down mentally until he is dirty with an unkept beard. In fact, he looses touch with reality to the point that even the movie's villians look at him horrified and shocked!! In Hell is more of a thriller than a mindless martial arts video. Van Damme is following in the footsteps of Jet LI, Jackie Chan, and my man Ho Chung Tao (AKA Bruce LI) who are great actors in their own right. One element that an above average actor must have is vulnerability.That is my major gripe about Steven Seagal's movies. HE almost always looks the same-his hair, his wardrobe. But the big flaw of Seagal's movies is that his characters are ""perfect"", with no flaws that most people have at least to a minor extent. On the other hand, Van Damme is not afraid to play roles that show weakness or vulnerablities in human nature. Even Jet Li and Jackie Chan have played alcholics and other flawed personality traits in which they had to battle within themselves to finally defeat their enemies. In many films, Jet LI also makes amends to those in which he has wronged.Van Damme is showing an ability to take risks with his acting by playing roles that show weaknesses in himself and his characters. Very moving, powerful performance by Van Damme!!All Van Damme needs is a good director and producer to compliment his new vision of more ""realistic"" acting to continually deliver high quality movies to his fans.Above average acting, good choreography, and a believable plot make this a suspense thriller well worth watching.

The cinematography and directing is great, thanks to Ringo Lam, a very underrated Hong Kong director, and the acting is very good as well. Van Damme has grown as an actor, and it shows in this film. Also look for a cameo by actor Paulo Tocha(Paco, the arrogant kickboxer from Bloodsport) as Victor.Van Damme is Kyle, a man jailed in a Russian prison for killing the murderer of his wife. The wardens set up illegal fights inside the prison, and Van Damme struggles to survive inside while maintaining his humanity.The fights are brutal and VERY realistic. They mirror real fights you would see in the streets or in UFC and other full contact events, which means elements of grappling and ground fighting are heavily utilized. This adds that much more to the realism of the film and shows Van Damme's versatility as a martial artist. In Derailed we saw some Ju-Jitsu and grappling from Van Damme, but he showcases these skills more heavily in this film.Do not rent or buy this film if you are looking for mindless action and high flying split kicks like in other Van Damme movies, but DO rent or buy it if you want to see a gritty and well directed prison drama with some realistic and brutal fights.",4,Very good prison action/drama,1089504000,"07 11, 2004",2004,2030,"[""'m"", 'really', 'sick', 'reading', 'negative', '2', '1', 'star', 'reviews', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'pissed', 'are', 'high', 'flying', 'kicks', 'HELLO', 'NOT', 'popcorn', 'action', 'film', 'more', 'drama', 'REALISTIC', 'depictions', 'prison', 'fighting', 'watching', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'quot', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'quot', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'then', 'being', 'pissed', 'wasnt', 'busting', 'out', 'guns', 'kicking', 'people', 'Matrix', 'Give', 'movie', 'bad', 'rating', 'way', 'NOT', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'more', 'chop-socky', 'fighting.All', 'aside', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'film', 'unwatchable', 'quot', 'Order', 'quot', 'tear-jerkingly', 'horrendous', 'quot', 'Derailed', 'quot', 'had', 'lost', 'hope', 'Van', 'Damme', 'quot', 'Hell', 'quot', 'possibly', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'one', 'most', 'effective', 'prison', 'dramas', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'cinematography', 'directing', 'great', 'thanks', 'Ringo', 'Lam', 'very', 'underrated', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'director', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'Van', 'Damme', 'grown', 'actor', 'film', 'Also', 'look', 'cameo', 'actor', 'Paulo', 'Tocha', 'Paco', 'arrogant', 'kickboxer', 'Bloodsport', 'Victor.Van', 'Damme', 'Kyle', 'man', 'jailed', 'Russian', 'prison', 'killing', 'murderer', 'wife', 'wardens', 'set', 'up', 'illegal', 'fights', 'prison', 'Van', 'Damme', 'survive', 'inside', 'maintaining', 'humanity.The', 'fights', 'are', 'brutal', 'VERY', 'realistic', 'mirror', 'real', 'fights', 'would', 'see', 'streets', 'UFC', 'other', 'full', 'contact', 'events', 'elements', 'grappling', 'ground', 'fighting', 'are', 'heavily', 'utilized', 'much', 'more', 'realism', 'film', 'Van', 'Damme', 'versatility', 'martial', 'artist', 'Derailed', 'saw', 'Ju-Jitsu', 'grappling', 'Van', 'Damme', 'skills', 'more', 'heavily', 'film.Do', 'not', 'rent', 'buy', 'film', 'are', 'looking', 'mindless', 'action', 'high', 'flying', 'split', 'kicks', 'other', 'Van', 'Damme', 'movies', 'DO', 'rent', 'buy', 'want', 'see', 'gritty', 'well', 'directed', 'prison', 'drama', 'realistic', 'brutal', 'fights']",N/A
777763,A2UDYL0ITJ3Y17,B0000DBJ2C,the kung fu kid,"[4, 6]","Van Damme plays Kyle LeBlanc a foreigner currently residing in Russia.  His wife complains that he's always so busy working that they never get a chance to see eachother.  He promises her that this is only a temporary situation and that things will soon change.  He's right.  While talking to her on his cell phone during his drive home she is brutally attacked and targeted for rape.  Panic-stricken Kyle races home to save her, but he is too late.  His wife's attacker, however, is still in the house.  He jumps Kyle from behind, but the enraged huband fights back starting a rousing chase scene through the busy city streets.  Justice takes a turn for the worst through legalities as Kyle LeBlanc is the one sentenced to life imprisonment for taking the law into his own hands.  What follows is a dark and gruelling picture of life behind bars and prison corruption.This is one of Van Dammes better pictures in recent years.  Director Ringo Lam is one of those directors who gives B quality pictures the same care he would give an A quality film.  He has a fine visual flair for storytelling as is evidenced throughout the film not only in moments of action (his car chases are always a highlight) but in subtle yet memorable varieties of camera placement (witness the scenes of solitary confinement which is a very small space yet he makes the absolute most and best of that space).  Van Damme has the capability to be one of the greats in this genre.  He has not only the looks and physical skills needed for action pictures, but also, as is shown in this picture, the ability to convey emotional feeling  without having to speak which, given the nature of action acting where words are often few and far between, is definitely a great plus.  Most of the action in this film for instance comes after long period's of time where Van Damme's character is watching, waiting, reflecting, suffering, and just simply trying to stay out of trouble.  These moments help make the action that inevitably does come after them all the more meaningful.  Ringo and Jean-Claude work well together and succeed in keeping audience interest during these quieter moments throughout the film, moments that exist primarily to set the stage up for what most people watch Van Damme movies for, the fights.  The fights in IN HELL are rough and raw.  All of the prison fighters are big and bulky convicts and as such there is an appropriate amount of wrestling and dirty kick-em-while-there-down tactics.  There's a minimal use of high spinning kicks (usually a Van Damme staple) and a lot of bare knuckle punches, but there are some nice wrestling takedowns to spice things up now and then.  The fact that the fighters here don't do anything really spectular is actually a plus.  The bare bone tactics seem more fitting to the theme of IN HELL where people who are treated like animals can become animals.Now for the drawbacks.  Lawrence Taylor is given the role of narrator and has a tendency to be a little monotonous.  He does fine otherwise, but there's a lot of ineffectual narration throughout the movie.  The story is a little overfamiliar.  Even Van Damme himself has visited this territory before in DEATH WARRANT (prison is a good setting for Van Damme films though since that was another one of his better vehicles) where he played an undercover mountie looking into prison corruption.  Also, there's no central villain to root against during the climax.  While there are various baddies you come to hate, in the end it is the prison system itself that is the real villain of the piece.  This serves the film's purpose, but the final showdown becomes a little less personal and a little less involving without that one central figure.  We are given a few hated villains to root against throughout the movie, but they are only a part of the climax and not the climax itself.  All in all this is a good Van Damme picture and hopefully things will continue to swing up from here for him and his fans.",3,Above Average Van Damme,1076630400,"02 13, 2004",2004,3989,"['Van', 'Damme', 'Kyle', 'LeBlanc', 'foreigner', 'currently', 'residing', 'Russia', 'wife', 'always', 'so', 'busy', 'working', 'never', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'eachother', 'only', 'temporary', 'situation', 'things', 'will', 'soon', 'change', 'right', 'talking', 'cell', 'phone', 'drive', 'home', 'brutally', 'attacked', 'targeted', 'rape', 'Panic-stricken', 'Kyle', 'home', 'save', 'too', 'late', 'wife', 'attacker', 'however', 'still', 'house', 'Kyle', 'enraged', 'huband', 'fights', 'back', 'starting', 'rousing', 'chase', 'scene', 'busy', 'city', 'streets', 'Justice', 'turn', 'worst', 'through', 'legalities', 'Kyle', 'LeBlanc', 'one', 'sentenced', 'life', 'imprisonment', 'taking', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'What', 'dark', 'gruelling', 'picture', 'life', 'bars', 'prison', 'corruption.This', 'one', 'Van', 'Dammes', 'better', 'pictures', 'recent', 'years', 'Director', 'Ringo', 'Lam', 'one', 'directors', 'who', 'B', 'quality', 'same', 'care', 'would', 'give', 'A', 'quality', 'film', 'fine', 'visual', 'flair', 'storytelling', 'as', 'evidenced', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'moments', 'action', 'car', 'chases', 'are', 'always', 'highlight', 'subtle', 'yet', 'memorable', 'varieties', 'camera', 'placement', 'scenes', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'very', 'small', 'space', 'yet', 'absolute', 'most', 'best', 'space', 'Van', 'Damme', 'capability', 'be', 'one', 'greats', 'genre', 'not', 'only', 'looks', 'physical', 'skills', 'needed', 'action', 'pictures', 'also', 'shown', 'picture', 'ability', 'convey', 'emotional', 'feeling', 'having', 'speak', 'given', 'nature', 'action', 'acting', 'where', 'words', 'are', 'often', 'few', 'far', 'definitely', 'great', 'plus', 'Most', 'action', 'film', 'instance', 'long', 'period', 'time', 'where', 'Van', 'Damme', 'character', 'watching', 'waiting', 'reflecting', 'suffering', 'just', 'simply', 'trying', 'stay', 'trouble', 'moments', 'help', 'make', 'action', 'inevitably', 'come', 'more', 'meaningful', 'Ringo', 'Jean-Claude', 'work', 'well', 'together', 'succeed', 'keeping', 'audience', 'interest', 'quieter', 'moments', 'film', 'moments', 'exist', 'primarily', 'set', 'stage', 'up', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'watch', 'Van', 'Damme', 'movies', 'fights', 'fights', 'IN', 'HELL', 'are', 'rough', 'raw', 'prison', 'fighters', 'are', 'big', 'bulky', 'convicts', 'such', 'appropriate', 'amount', 'wrestling', 'dirty', 'kick-em-while-there-down', 'tactics', 'minimal', 'use', 'high', 'spinning', 'kicks', 'usually', 'Van', 'Damme', 'staple', 'lot', 'bare', 'knuckle', 'punches', 'are', 'nice', 'wrestling', 'takedowns', 'spice', 'things', 'up', 'now', 'then', 'fact', 'fighters', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'really', 'spectular', 'actually', 'plus', 'bare', 'bone', 'tactics', 'seem', 'more', 'fitting', 'theme', 'IN', 'HELL', 'where', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'treated', 'animals', 'can', 'become', 'animals.Now', 'drawbacks', 'Lawrence', 'Taylor', 'given', 'role', 'narrator', 'tendency', 'be', 'little', 'monotonous', 'fine', 'otherwise', 'lot', 'ineffectual', 'narration', 'movie', 'story', 'little', 'overfamiliar', 'Even', 'Van', 'Damme', 'visited', 'territory', 'DEATH', 'WARRANT', 'prison', 'good', 'setting', 'Van', 'Damme', 'films', 'was', 'one', 'better', 'vehicles', 'where', 'played', 'undercover', 'mountie', 'looking', 'prison', 'corruption', 'Also', 'central', 'villain', 'root', 'climax', 'are', 'various', 'baddies', 'come', 'hate', 'end', 'prison', 'system', 'real', 'villain', 'piece', 'film', 'purpose', 'final', 'showdown', 'little', 'less', 'personal', 'little', 'less', 'involving', 'one', 'central', 'figure', 'are', 'given', 'few', 'hated', 'villains', 'root', 'movie', 'are', 'only', 'part', 'climax', 'not', 'climax', 'good', 'Van', 'Damme', 'picture', 'hopefully', 'things', 'will', 'continue', 'swing', 'up', 'here', 'fans']",N/A

777765,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000DBJ2C,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 2]","The third Ringo Lam/Van Damme collaboration is not your typical martial arts film.  It is more like a prison drama, and if you want to see Van Damme kicking the bad guys, you should see &quot;Maximum Risk&quot; or &quot;Replicant.&quot;Van Damme is Kyle, an American working at a steel factory in Russia.  But when his wife got killed by a Russian mobster, Kyle himself ends up in a corrupt Russian prison, where any human dignity is deprived by the harsh rules of the place.Surprisingly, in the film which means change of pace for him, Van Damme shows that he can act pretty well.  Kyle's pains of being humiliated by the prison wards are convincingly shown on the screen, and though the prison formula is nothing new, it still works to some extent, thanks to the credible production designs.But still we miss his actions.  And in this film, there are lots of fighting scenes (mainly between the prisoners), but not the kind of the ones you see in his previous films like &quot;Quest&quot; or &quot;Timecop.&quot;  They are bone-crunching type, like real bloody street fighting.  Ringo Lam obviously means realism here, perhaps going back to his roots in Hong Kong era.  But if you want escapism, like over-the-top actions Van Damme once showed in &quot;Maximum Risk&quot; or &quot;Timecop,&quot; you should avoid this one.The supporting cast is just a typical list of stock characters, but among them, as laconic and philosophical 'No. 451,' Lawrence Taylor (ex-NFL footballer) shows good amount of presence.&quot;In Hell&quot; is not bad as a film, but not a thing you expect from the name of Van Damme.
