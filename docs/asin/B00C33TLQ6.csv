This new collection is so much better than the last one sold. It's almost perfect as a matter of fact. Besides you get to watch Rod doing a great job.

I bought this with some confidence the movie would be pretty decent quality, given it's 40 years old, but, if this is digitally remastered, than I'm on my way to training camp with the San Francisco 49er's as the next Joe Montana.  The problem goes beyond this movie, as now I will be very hesitant to buy anything promoted by Amazon.com as an exclusive that says ""digitally remastered.""  Once bitten, twice shy, as you got my $ 10 bucks with ""Powderkeg"", but,  it's highly unlikely you'll ever see $ 10 from me again on a digitally remastered promise.  Shame on you for this deception.  Next time charge half the price and don't promote it as digitally remastered.  Then, the decision is ours, as to whether we waste our money.  You wasted it for us on a false promise.  This quality is worse than my home 8mm movies from the same time period.",1,"Once bitten, twice shy",1369612800,"05 27, 2013",2013,922,"['Wow', 'am', 'disappointed', 'Digitally', 'remastered', 'What', 'waste', 'two', 'words', 'bought', 'confidence', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'decent', 'quality', 'given', '40', 'years', 'old', 'digitally', 'remastered', ""'m"", 'way', 'training', 'camp', 'San', 'Francisco', '49er', 'next', 'Joe', 'Montana', 'problem', 'movie', 'now', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'hesitant', 'buy', 'anything', 'promoted', 'Amazon.com', 'exclusive', 'digitally', 'remastered', 'Once', 'bitten', 'twice', 'shy', 'got', '10', 'bucks', 'Powderkeg', 'highly', 'unlikely', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', '10', 'again', 'digitally', 'remastered', 'promise', 'Shame', 'deception', 'Next', 'time', 'charge', 'price', 'do', ""n't"", 'promote', 'digitally', 'remastered', 'Then', 'decision', 'ours', 'waste', 'money', 'wasted', 'false', 'promise', 'quality', 'worse', 'home', '8mm', 'movies', 'same', 'time', 'period']",N/A
1641613,A3FNITVBF7GWZK,B00C33TLQ6,H. Keller,"[13, 13]","I hate to say it, but I agree with the other reviewers. My expectations for this release were established by the Shout Factory's release of Bearcats! The video quality of this release is mediocre at best. There is a considerable amount of bouncing around (it really caught my eye during the first conference scene).  Old timers will recognize this from their VHS video days as needing to make an adjustment in the VCR's tracking control. It is as though they simply fed the VHS master through a DVD maker. Yeah, I suppose that is digitized, but not quite what viewers expect.Some scenes were sharp, many on the fuzzy side, and some scenes (like the first test of the secret hatch buried in the track) the Stutz, the horizon, and sky all seemed to merge into a bright, blurry indistinct image. I suppose Amazon gets a tip of the hat for offering this to go along with the new video release, but execution was awful.",2,"Good story, dud video reproduction",1369699200,"05 28, 2013",2013,914,"['hate', 'say', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'expectations', 'release', 'were', 'established', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'release', 'Bearcats', 'video', 'quality', 'release', 'mediocre', 'best', 'considerable', 'amount', 'bouncing', 'really', 'caught', 'eye', 'first', 'conference', 'scene', 'Old', 'timers', 'will', 'recognize', 'VHS', 'video', 'days', 'needing', 'make', 'adjustment', 'VCR', 'tracking', 'control', 'simply', 'fed', 'VHS', 'master', 'DVD', 'maker', 'Yeah', 'suppose', 'digitized', 'not', 'quite', 'what', 'expect.Some', 'scenes', 'were', 'sharp', 'many', 'fuzzy', 'side', 'scenes', 'first', 'test', 'secret', 'hatch', 'buried', 'track', 'Stutz', 'horizon', 'sky', 'seemed', 'merge', 'bright', 'blurry', 'indistinct', 'image', 'suppose', 'Amazon', 'tip', 'hat', 'offering', 'go', 'along', 'new', 'video', 'release', 'execution', 'was', 'awful']",N/A
