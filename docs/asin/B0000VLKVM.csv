It does offer a brief look into an adolescent psychiatric ward that is realistic- but I would have liked it if the movie really showed the people struggling in the psych ward with different specific disorders. We have some severely catatonic schizophrenic people...and then there are those who self destruct by cutting and burning... there are a handful of those who struggle with anger management..and a girl who has severely scary nightmares. What about the other things? The opportunity to put in other disorders & conditions such as bipolar.. or eating disorders.. or even someone who struggled with multiple personalities- I think the directors could have made it a lot more interesting if they took more time to make it.I am not saying it is unrealistic because I did spend some time in a psych ward..and there was things such as level drops and prohibiting the use of shoelaces on our shoes and of course- anything sharp. There was even the occasional person that would try to smoke in the bathrooms. However, it's hard to make a movie like this because it feels like so much more of a documentary than a movie...and I really didn't like that.Props to Joseph Gordon-Levitt though- he did a GREAT job in a role I am sure was hard for him to play.",2,redo this movie- and make it better,1136419200,"01 5, 2006",2006,1355,"['was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'expected', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'MORE', 'was', ""n't"", 'offer', 'brief', 'look', 'adolescent', 'psychiatric', 'ward', 'realistic-', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'movie', 'really', 'showed', 'people', 'struggling', 'psych', 'ward', 'different', 'specific', 'disorders', 'have', 'severely', 'catatonic', 'schizophrenic', 'people', 'then', 'are', 'who', 'self', 'destruct', 'cutting', 'burning', 'are', 'handful', 'who', 'struggle', 'anger', 'management..and', 'girl', 'who', 'severely', 'scary', 'nightmares', 'What', 'other', 'things', 'opportunity', 'put', 'other', 'disorders', 'conditions', 'such', 'bipolar..', 'eating', 'disorders..', 'even', 'someone', 'who', 'struggled', 'multiple', 'personalities-', 'think', 'directors', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'took', 'more', 'time', 'make', 'it.I', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'unrealistic', 'did', 'spend', 'time', 'psych', 'ward..and', 'there', 'was', 'things', 'such', 'level', 'drops', 'prohibiting', 'use', 'shoelaces', 'shoes', 'course-', 'anything', 'sharp', 'was', 'even', 'occasional', 'person', 'would', 'try', 'smoke', 'bathrooms', 'However', 'hard', 'make', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'documentary', 'movie', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'that.Props', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'though-', 'did', 'GREAT', 'job', 'role', 'am', 'sure', 'was', 'hard', 'play']",Manic

I can't believe how relistic this movie is compared to the real thing. Sure there are some moments in the movie which a professional will say that ""it wouldnt work like that"" or ""That should have been handled differently"" however, overall the movie was awesome. The main thing I liked about this movie was the therapist and his drive to help even though everything he tries usually leads to failure with the kids he works with. Working in this field, I know EXACTLY how he feels. How can you reach people who dont want to be reached? It hurts so much and is very draining to care about those that don't care about themselves. I understand all of the theories of how to help people however there are those that it doesnt matter what you try. It doesnt matter to them... they have already given up on themselves. This movie shows all of that. I highly relate to the therapist of this movie. This movie would be great to use in regards to mental health staff training and even during group therapy with trouble kids - especially teens. I think it would be helpful to let kids see other kids act the way they do at times and see what they feel about it - what comes up for discussion. See there I'm in the process of trying to figure out another way of helping. Its a constant cycle. Keep trying and trying. One sad thing about this movie is that there are some kids that are helped in real life. I dont want anyone to read this post or watch the movie and feel this type of care is worthless because it is not. I have made a difference in the lives of many kids. I wish this movie would have shown one kid having a break through that led to success. It didnt. That was the missing component of the movie. It's an amazing feeling to make a difference in someone's life - to save someone's life by showing them a better way of living. It's a great feeling to get through to them. I wish the movie would have shown that. Another thing I didnt like is that the regular mental health care worker, not the therapist, was shown more as a bouncer in the movie. If something went wrong they were there to restrain and the therapist did all of the mental health care work. In real life treatment, that is totally not true. Most of the time it is the regular mental health care worker doing the day to day routines and working with the real problems. The therapist just comes in for their weekly group and individual sessions. I wish they would have shown the value and the drive of the workers that work on the floor taking care of the kids. With that said, this is a great movie most people probably couldn't relate to. There is more to this movie than just ""your typical nut job flick"" as previous posts have stated.",5,The opinion of a mental health care worker.....,1131580800,"11 10, 2005",2005,2784,"['am', 'currently', 'mental', 'health', 'care', 'worker', 'facility', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'relistic', 'movie', 'compared', 'real', 'thing', 'Sure', 'are', 'moments', 'movie', 'professional', 'will', 'say', 'wouldnt', 'work', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'handled', 'differently', 'however', 'overall', 'movie', 'was', 'awesome', 'main', 'thing', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'therapist', 'drive', 'help', 'even', 'everything', 'usually', 'failure', 'kids', 'Working', 'field', 'know', 'EXACTLY', 'how', 'How', 'can', 'reach', 'people', 'who', 'dont', 'want', 'be', 'reached', 'so', 'much', 'very', 'draining', 'care', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'understand', 'theories', 'how', 'help', 'people', 'however', 'are', 'matter', 'what', 'try', 'matter', 'have', 'already', 'given', 'up', 'movie', 'highly', 'relate', 'therapist', 'movie', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'use', 'regards', 'mental', 'health', 'staff', 'training', 'even', 'group', 'therapy', 'trouble', 'kids', 'especially', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'helpful', 'let', 'kids', 'see', 'other', 'kids', 'way', 'do', 'times', 'see', 'what', 'feel', 'what', 'up', 'discussion', 'See', ""'m"", 'process', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'helping', 'constant', 'cycle', 'Keep', 'trying', 'trying', 'One', 'sad', 'thing', 'movie', 'are', 'kids', 'are', 'helped', 'real', 'life', 'dont', 'want', 'anyone', 'read', 'post', 'watch', 'movie', 'feel', 'type', 'care', 'worthless', 'not', 'have', 'made', 'difference', 'lives', 'many', 'kids', 'wish', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'shown', 'one', 'kid', 'having', 'break', 'led', 'success', 'was', 'missing', 'component', 'movie', 'amazing', 'feeling', 'make', 'difference', 'someone', 'life', 'save', 'someone', 'life', 'showing', 'better', 'way', 'living', 'great', 'feeling', 'get', 'wish', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'shown', 'thing', 'didnt', 'regular', 'mental', 'health', 'care', 'worker', 'not', 'therapist', 'was', 'shown', 'more', 'bouncer', 'movie', 'something', 'went', 'wrong', 'were', 'there', 'restrain', 'therapist', 'did', 'mental', 'health', 'care', 'work', 'real', 'life', 'treatment', 'totally', 'not', 'true', 'Most', 'time', 'regular', 'mental', 'health', 'care', 'worker', 'doing', 'day', 'day', 'routines', 'working', 'real', 'problems', 'therapist', 'just', 'weekly', 'group', 'individual', 'sessions', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'shown', 'value', 'drive', 'workers', 'work', 'floor', 'taking', 'care', 'kids', 'said', 'great', 'movie', 'most', 'people', 'probably', 'could', ""n't"", 'relate', 'more', 'movie', 'just', 'typical', 'nut', 'job', 'flick', 'previous', 'posts', 'have', 'stated']",Manic
787287,A3TIJC6L8USJ6Q,B0000VLKVM,Elderbear,"[52, 60]","In a day when armed guards lurk in our schools and teens get tried and sentenced as adults, the film Manic opens a portal into teen rage, pain, and the existential demands of growing up. The acting, script, and phenomenal cinematography come together to grab the viewer's guts with razor talons-this is an easy movie to avoid, to turn away from, but those who dare to watch it, and to find their own anger and rage challenged, cannot watch it unscathed.The movie opens with Lyle (3rd Rock's Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who plays a phenomenal role in this movie), in his late teens, having wounds sutured and his facial bruises attended to. He's anxious to go home with his mom, but two burly psych techs grab him, pump him with a tranquilizer and cart him off to a youth psychiatric unit.Intense as this may seem, the opening credits disturb the viewer even more intensively. Lyle is in the clinical therapist's office, being interviewed. Between each question, the screen goes black and a set of credits is posted, while the sound of a fight turning into a beating runs in the background.This sets the stage for a movie that uses digital cinematography, fast cuts, cine verite, and unexpected color to portray the chaotic life of the disturbed. Scene color schemes were actually drawn from several key van Gogh paintings, one of which plays a key role in the movie. Story lines and subplots develop. Lyle's murderous rage surfaces over and over again, challenged, each time, by his therapist. In one particularly charged scene, the therapist smashes a chair during group and asks, ""Does that feel better? NO! So now I have to smash something else!"" He hurls another chair, ""Feel better yet? NO! So now you have to do what we all have to do, you have to live with the feelings!""Ironically, this movie is more about anger management than the movie, Anger Management. This has all the intensity of a gritty, no-holds-barred war movie. And that's no accident, it's about the war within, the battle between a teen and his pent up rage. Ultimately, it's an existential movie, examining the choice to live or to die, made in the solitude of one's soul. Whatever the situation, whatever our escape plans are ... ""wherever we go, there we are."" Manic suggests that the only place freedom can be found is locked in engagement with oneself.Although does go a little ""Hollywood"" at the end, this is not one of those horrid dramas which suggest that once the hero confronts a key past trauma in a cathartic moment everything turns around. In fact, the therapist, played by Don Cheadle, explicitly denies this: ""You may have some epiphanal moment about your father and escape your rage. It's more likely you're going to have it all your life, and have to learn to live your life without destroying yourself or others.""If the movie has a major shortcoming, it is that the psych staff is too helpful. My experience with locked wards finds it highly improbable that Lyle would have been allowed to continue in his room, with his group, after a violent outburst. Most psychiatrists and therapists don't have the courage of Don Cheadle's character, to allow potentially dangerous situations to continue in this litigious day and age. Lyle would have been lugged off to a higher security ward, possibly sedated, and denied the interactions he needed to begin his healing process. But I criticize the mental health system, not the movie, here.Finally a movie that dares to tell the truth. It never falls into the cliche of trying to be a One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, and it beats Girl Interrupted and 28 Days in intensity and veracity. Carl Jung wrote ""enlightenment consists not in the seeing of luminous shapes and visions, but in making the darkness visible."" Manic has the courage to show us a piece of that darkness, yet in gazing at it, we find a certain luminosity. In the last analysis we're left with a movie about rage, about having the courage to feel the pain behind the rage, and daring to go on living, finding freedom not by banishing the demons within, but by learning to live with them.",5,"The ""Real"" Anger Management Movie",1073606400,"01 9, 2004",2004,4081,"['day', 'when', 'armed', 'guards', 'lurk', 'schools', 'teens', 'get', 'tried', 'sentenced', 'adults', 'film', 'Manic', 'portal', 'teen', 'rage', 'pain', 'existential', 'demands', 'growing', 'up', 'acting', 'script', 'phenomenal', 'cinematography', 'come', 'together', 'grab', 'viewer', 'guts', 'razor', 'talons-this', 'easy', 'movie', 'avoid', 'turn', 'away', 'who', 'dare', 'watch', 'find', 'own', 'anger', 'rage', 'challenged', 'can', 'not', 'watch', 'unscathed.The', 'movie', 'Lyle', '3rd', 'Rock', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'who', 'phenomenal', 'role', 'movie', 'late', 'teens', 'having', 'wounds', 'sutured', 'facial', 'bruises', 'attended', 'anxious', 'go', 'home', 'mom', 'two', 'burly', 'psych', 'techs', 'grab', 'pump', 'tranquilizer', 'cart', 'off', 'youth', 'psychiatric', 'unit.Intense', 'may', 'seem', 'opening', 'credits', 'disturb', 'viewer', 'even', 'more', 'intensively', 'Lyle', 'clinical', 'therapist', 'office', 'being', 'interviewed', 'Between', 'question', 'screen', 'black', 'set', 'credits', 'posted', 'sound', 'fight', 'turning', 'beating', 'background.This', 'stage', 'movie', 'digital', 'cinematography', 'fast', 'cuts', 'cine', 'verite', 'unexpected', 'color', 'portray', 'chaotic', 'life', 'disturbed', 'Scene', 'color', 'schemes', 'were', 'actually', 'drawn', 'several', 'key', 'van', 'Gogh', 'paintings', 'one', 'key', 'role', 'movie', 'Story', 'lines', 'subplots', 'develop', 'Lyle', 'murderous', 'rage', 'surfaces', 'over', 'again', 'challenged', 'time', 'therapist', 'one', 'particularly', 'charged', 'scene', 'therapist', 'chair', 'group', 'feel', 'better', 'NO', 'So', 'now', 'have', 'smash', 'something', 'else', 'chair', 'Feel', 'better', 'yet', 'NO', 'So', 'now', 'have', 'do', 'what', 'have', 'do', 'have', 'live', 'feelings', 'Ironically', 'movie', 'more', 'anger', 'management', 'movie', 'Anger', 'Management', 'intensity', 'gritty', 'no-holds-barred', 'war', 'movie', 'accident', 'war', 'battle', 'teen', 'pent', 'up', 'rage', 'Ultimately', 'existential', 'movie', 'examining', 'choice', 'live', 'die', 'made', 'solitude', 'one', 'soul', 'situation', 'escape', 'plans', 'are', 'go', 'are', 'Manic', 'only', 'place', 'freedom', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'locked', 'engagement', 'oneself.Although', 'go', 'little', 'Hollywood', 'end', 'not', 'one', 'horrid', 'dramas', 'suggest', 'once', 'hero', 'key', 'past', 'trauma', 'cathartic', 'moment', 'everything', 'around', 'fact', 'therapist', 'played', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'explicitly', 'may', 'have', 'epiphanal', 'moment', 'father', 'escape', 'rage', 'more', 'likely', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'life', 'have', 'learn', 'live', 'life', 'destroying', 'others', 'movie', 'major', 'shortcoming', 'psych', 'staff', 'too', 'helpful', 'experience', 'locked', 'wards', 'highly', 'improbable', 'Lyle', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'allowed', 'continue', 'room', 'group', 'violent', 'outburst', 'Most', 'psychiatrists', 'therapists', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'courage', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'character', 'allow', 'potentially', 'dangerous', 'situations', 'continue', 'litigious', 'day', 'age', 'Lyle', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lugged', 'off', 'higher', 'security', 'ward', 'possibly', 'sedated', 'denied', 'interactions', 'needed', 'begin', 'healing', 'process', 'criticize', 'mental', 'health', 'system', 'not', 'movie', 'here.Finally', 'movie', 'tell', 'truth', 'never', 'cliche', 'trying', 'be', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', '28', 'Days', 'intensity', 'veracity', 'Carl', 'Jung', 'wrote', 'enlightenment', 'not', 'seeing', 'luminous', 'shapes', 'visions', 'making', 'darkness', 'visible', 'Manic', 'courage', 'show', 'piece', 'darkness', 'yet', 'gazing', 'find', 'certain', 'luminosity', 'last', 'analysis', ""'re"", 'left', 'movie', 'rage', 'having', 'courage', 'feel', 'pain', 'rage', 'daring', 'go', 'living', 'finding', 'freedom', 'not', 'banishing', 'demons', 'learning', 'live']",Manic

In a hauntingly realistic portrayal of mental turmoil, the movie follows the painstakingly slow (or non-existent) progress for Lyle, suicidal Tracy (Zooey Deschanel), self-injuring goth rocker Sara (Sara Rivas), bipolar rich kid Chad (Michael Bacall), and sexually abused Kenny (Cody Lightning).  Don Cheadle portrays staff therapist Dr. Dave, a man who struggles against his own feelings of futility and ineffectiveness.  The teens have angst, their families are near the breaking point, and those charged with fixing the out-of-control teens lack all the answers.Director Jordan Melamed shot the film on hand-held digital video in an actual mental hospital, strongly adhering to the essential intentions of the Dogme 95 movement.  As such, film is not a barrier between the viewer and the action on screen.Manic is never sensationalist; rather, it uncovers truths that lurk in the lives of nearly all families.  There are no trite life lessons, no jaw-dropping ""crazy person"" performances in hope of an Oscar nod, and the end isn't tied up with a big pretty bow.

787295,A1UUVQS8X31RH1,B0000VLKVM,Kalie A. Gipson,"[0, 0]","This movie, Manic, is the first movie in a long time that I was eager to watch. I know it was released back in 2003 or 2004, and I've seen the movie case at video stores but never bothered to look and see what it was about. Well, you know on those really lazy days when there seems to be nothing to do, and you're just flipping through the channels on TV desperately trying to find something to watch? On one of those days, I saw a movie coming on entitled ""Manic"", and I figured due to the title it may have something to do with manic depression, (which would make the movie interesting since I have it), so I decided to hit the information button to get a plot sypnosis. It sounded good so I watched it. I'm glad I did.The movie is centered around Lyle (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a teen who had an abusive father and has a huge anger problem. From the beginning, you hear noises that sound like someone being beaten, which is exactly what's happening, as Lyle beats another teen across the head with a baseball bat at a game, and you learn that the teen he beats has to get his jaw wired shut. These actions get him a place in a psychiatric ward, seeing as he needed help controlling his anger and his self-abuse, as he also cut himself and sometimes burned himself with cigarettes.The other teens at the ward are very realistic with their problems. Chad (played by Michael Bacall) is suffering with depression and also has a cutting problem. Another teen, Kenny, was sexually abused and as a result molested young children himself. One girl, Tracy, has terrifying nightmares that make her scream when she tries to sleep. Mike is a teen who in his own words, likes to smoke, drink, and likes to fight. Sara is a girl who also has a cutting problem and has depression. The doctor, David Monroe, (played amazingly by Don Cheadle), works with the teens and you can tell he actually cares about them. David doesn't feed nonsense to his teens though, and he doesn't lie to them. He tells Lyle in the film that his anger will most likely be with him for his whole life, but he's got to learn how to live with it and express it in a less destructive way, or he will keep on until he hurts someone he cares about or maybe even kills himself.The script, dialogue, scenes, and all the problems presented are very realistic. I myself actually have many of the problems that the teens have in the film, especially an anger problem just like Lyle, so I know that the emotional scenes are not overacted or overdramatic. Lyle makes a rival with Mike in the film, and many of the more serious scenes in the movie are where Lyle lashes out at him in a very believable manner. Viewers with anger problems, like me, can empathize with Lyle and his feelings. I believe anyone who has had problems like anger, cutting, and/or depression can connect with this movie on a deep level just like I did.Some people complain about the way the movie was filmed. Yes, at times the camera angles may become annoying, as this is a lower budget film. The angles make the film appear a little like a documentary, even though it is not. If you can get past the way the camera moves, and just focus on the story and what's happening, this should not be a big deal. The acting in the movie is great in my opinion. Michael Bacall did a great job as Chad. Don Cheadle does an amazing job in the film. His emotions are especially felt in one scene where he goes into a rage ironically in response to an altercation between Lyle and Mike. They couldn't have picked any other actor to play Lyle better than Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who is definitely a promising actor. He portrays Lyle very well. The film also avoids cliche's. In reality there are no happy endings where everyone turns out just fine at the end of some terrible period of their life. This movie shows that, making it even more realistic in it's approach. The movie shows the true issues that teens have in their lives that so many movies do NOT show, and it shows those issues perfectly. Even though there are some problems not shown, it doesn't take anything away from the movie.One only problem I have with this movie is something other reviewers have mentioned: the film just ends, leaving us with no answers. No loose ends are tied up. You don't find out what happens to any of the other patients in the ward. It just kind of leaves you hanging to guess for yourself. But other than this, there really isn't anything else I could complain about. The acting is great, the script and dialogue is nice, and the overall story is very realistic. People like me who have very similar problems to the characters in the movie may appreciate this movie more than others who don't, but I believe anyone can enjoy it. It's powerful, gripping, and you won't forget about it for a long time after watching.

I'm not sure anyone could have, save an editor with a much lighter touch than the one recruited to cut this film.The story centers on Lyle (Gordon-Levitt), a teen who gets sent to a hospital's psycho ward after a violent episode during which he severely beat a fellow teen with a baseball bat. David Monroe (Don Cheadle), the doctor overseeing the ward, has a lot of patients with issues to work with, so once Lyle gets to the ward, the film shifts into ensemble mode. There's Chad (Michael Bacall, who also co-wrote the screenplay), an affable agoraphobic with whom Lyle quickly bonds; Kenny (Cody Lightning), Lyle's roommate, who's in for molestation; Sara (Sara Rivas), the goth with anger issues; Tracy (Zoeey Deschanel), the introvert working on her self-esteem; etc.I'm pretty sure you can see the problem already-- clich&eacute; abounds in this film. But that might be forgivable (certainly, where this sort of thing is concerned, it's miles better than, say, Girl, Interrupted) if the movie actually told a coherent story. This one tries to, but fails so miserably I can only place the blame on an editor who was told, ""this movie must be x number of minutes long. Make sure it gets there."" There's a difference between the artistic creation of impressionism in film and just hacking out large pieces of character development, setting, scene, and anything not relating to plot (especially when the plot is so necessarily thin). As I said before, though, I'm just assuming; if the script was actually written this way, then the blame must be placed squarely on Bacall and co-writer Blayne Weaver, who have a lot to learn about that wonderful goblin known as continuity.There are the bones of an excellent film here, but it never boils enough to really congeal into a soup. **",2,"Gordon-Levitt and Cheadle tag-team, but still can't save this.",1212105600,"05 30, 2008",2008,1926,"['Manic', 'Jordan', 'Melamed', '2001', 'As', 'fond', 'am', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'could', ""n't"", 'save', 'Jordan', 'Melamed', 'first', 'date', 'only', 'feature', 'Manic', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'anyone', 'could', 'have', 'save', 'editor', 'much', 'lighter', 'touch', 'one', 'recruited', 'cut', 'film.The', 'story', 'centers', 'Lyle', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'teen', 'who', 'sent', 'hospital', 'psycho', 'ward', 'violent', 'episode', 'severely', 'beat', 'fellow', 'teen', 'baseball', 'bat', 'David', 'Monroe', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'doctor', 'overseeing', 'ward', 'lot', 'patients', 'issues', 'work', 'so', 'once', 'Lyle', 'ward', 'film', 'shifts', 'ensemble', 'mode', 'Chad', 'Michael', 'Bacall', 'who', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'affable', 'agoraphobic', 'whom', 'Lyle', 'quickly', 'bonds', 'Kenny', 'Cody', 'Lightning', 'Lyle', 'roommate', 'who', 'molestation', 'Sara', 'Sara', 'Rivas', 'goth', 'anger', 'issues', 'Tracy', 'Zoeey', 'Deschanel', 'introvert', 'working', 'self-esteem', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'can', 'see', 'problem', 'already', 'clich', 'eacute', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'forgivable', 'certainly', 'where', 'sort', 'thing', 'concerned', 'miles', 'better', 'say', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'movie', 'actually', 'told', 'coherent', 'story', 'one', 'so', 'miserably', 'can', 'only', 'place', 'blame', 'editor', 'who', 'was', 'told', 'movie', 'must', 'be', 'x', 'number', 'minutes', 'long', 'Make', 'sure', 'there', 'difference', 'artistic', 'creation', 'impressionism', 'film', 'just', 'hacking', 'out', 'large', 'pieces', 'character', 'development', 'setting', 'scene', 'anything', 'not', 'relating', 'plot', 'especially', 'when', 'plot', 'so', 'necessarily', 'thin', 'said', ""'m"", 'just', 'assuming', 'script', 'was', 'actually', 'written', 'way', 'then', 'blame', 'must', 'be', 'placed', 'squarely', 'Bacall', 'co-writer', 'Blayne', 'Weaver', 'who', 'have', 'lot', 'learn', 'wonderful', 'goblin', 'known', 'continuity.There', 'are', 'bones', 'excellent', 'film', 'here', 'never', 'enough', 'really', 'congeal', 'soup', '**']",Manic

Calhoun ""rhymeswithorange""","[4, 6]","After bashing in the head of a classmate with a baseball bat Lyle (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is involuntarily committed to a psychiatric ward for troubled teens. Throughout his life Lyle has been expressing anger as a result of being beat up by his father when he was younger. But now that he is committed he doesn't let go of his ways easily as he feels that his anger is rightly justified. It takes some time for Lyle to let down his guard and befriend the other troubled teens. He eventually forms a close friendship with his roommate who is charged with molesting young children and a lonely big-eyed girl who suffers from terrible screaming nightmares every night. There are lots of scenes showing the mundane activities of life of patients inside the psychiatric ward. When they aren't playing basketball, reading existential philosophy, or slam dancing to Rage Against the Machine they are often found in group therapy. Each patient has their own story to tell including histories filled with suicide attempts, drug abuse, cutting, extreme violence, and other self-destructive acts. The method of filmmaking is experimental and can put some viewers off. Often the frames are shaky and unstable and appear to be filmed with a handheld device. This appeared to give the effect of being a personal observer inside the ward. This aspect didn't bother me at all but what did bother me was a general feeling of uneasiness when the film was over. I felt as if the pieces of the plot puzzle failed to come together properly. I was strangely unsettled about the lack of explanation of the motivations of Lyle. It seemed as if in one scene he is lashing out his anger, the next he is a saint while trying to calm down others, and then he returns once again to betting up others - and all this happened without any proper explanation. As a result his actions often came off as being unrealistic and one-dimensional. In addition, I had trouble with the overall plot and the intentions of the filmmakers. If there was an intended message of this film it dearly failed. I felt that it didn't do anything but continually spinning its wheels. I've been anxiously waiting for MANIC to be released on DVD but now that I've seen it I hate to admit that I feel let down. I was expecting so much more.",3,"&quot;Mom, tell 'em I'm not crazy!!&quot;",1075852800,"02 4, 2004",2004,2283,"['bashing', 'head', 'classmate', 'baseball', 'bat', 'Lyle', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'involuntarily', 'committed', 'psychiatric', 'ward', 'troubled', 'teens', 'life', 'Lyle', 'been', 'expressing', 'anger', 'result', 'being', 'beat', 'up', 'father', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'now', 'committed', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'ways', 'easily', 'anger', 'rightly', 'justified', 'time', 'Lyle', 'let', 'down', 'guard', 'befriend', 'other', 'troubled', 'teens', 'eventually', 'close', 'friendship', 'roommate', 'who', 'charged', 'molesting', 'young', 'children', 'lonely', 'big-eyed', 'girl', 'who', 'terrible', 'screaming', 'nightmares', 'night', 'are', 'lots', 'scenes', 'showing', 'mundane', 'activities', 'life', 'patients', 'psychiatric', 'ward', 'When', 'are', ""n't"", 'playing', 'basketball', 'reading', 'existential', 'philosophy', 'slam', 'dancing', 'Rage', 'Machine', 'are', 'often', 'found', 'group', 'therapy', 'patient', 'own', 'story', 'tell', 'including', 'histories', 'filled', 'suicide', 'attempts', 'drug', 'abuse', 'cutting', 'extreme', 'violence', 'other', 'self-destructive', 'acts', 'method', 'filmmaking', 'experimental', 'can', 'put', 'viewers', 'off', 'Often', 'frames', 'are', 'shaky', 'unstable', 'appear', 'be', 'filmed', 'handheld', 'device', 'appeared', 'give', 'effect', 'being', 'personal', 'observer', 'ward', 'aspect', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'what', 'did', 'bother', 'was', 'general', 'feeling', 'uneasiness', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'felt', 'pieces', 'plot', 'puzzle', 'failed', 'come', 'together', 'properly', 'was', 'strangely', 'unsettled', 'lack', 'explanation', 'motivations', 'Lyle', 'seemed', 'one', 'scene', 'lashing', 'out', 'anger', 'next', 'saint', 'trying', 'calm', 'down', 'others', 'then', 'once', 'again', 'betting', 'up', 'others', 'happened', 'proper', 'explanation', 'result', 'actions', 'often', 'came', 'off', 'being', 'unrealistic', 'one-dimensional', 'addition', 'had', 'trouble', 'overall', 'plot', 'intentions', 'filmmakers', 'was', 'intended', 'message', 'film', 'dearly', 'failed', 'felt', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'continually', 'spinning', 'wheels', ""'ve"", 'been', 'anxiously', 'waiting', 'MANIC', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'hate', 'admit', 'feel', 'let', 'down', 'was', 'expecting', 'so', 'much', 'more']",Manic

I must say it was worth it.I really have no complaints about the film; the acting was great, especially from Joseph Gordon-Levitt- who really proves what a good actor he is, Don Cheadle, and Zooey Deschanel. The story seems very accurate, haunting, and at times heartbreaking, as it paints a very realistic picture of teens with problems. There's no fluff here.Direction was great.

787307,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B0000VLKVM,Todd Smith,"[1, 1]","Lyle Jensen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has a few issues with anger management. Most of the time, he's in complete control, but one day, during a baseball game, he loses it and almost kills someone. Lyle's not quite eighteen yet, so he's sent to a psychiatric hospital, where he learns that compared to others, his problems are nothing. I've said it before and I'll say it again, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the single most underrated and under appreciated actor in all of Hollywood. I've seen a lot of his films, some are great and some are awful, but the fact remains that he always gives a strong performance and makes even the worst movie that much better. Manic was a rare inside look at a youth psychiatric facility, but there wasn't much of a story behind it. Of course we meet Lyle and the other patients, finding out why they're there, but there really isn't a point to it. The quality of the film further decreases with the way it was filmed, as every scene features constant movement from numerous angles. Similar to these camcorder films, I honestly found it pretty distracting, not to mention nauseating. The best part of Manic though is clearly the performances. This was released in 2001, before any of the stars were household names, however after seeing the film, it's easy to see why they all became popular. Don Cheadle is another actor that doesn't get the recognition he deserves, playing the Doctor in Manic, he is the glue that brings everyone together. Even with JGL's performance, this film is a mess of nonsense without Don Cheadle. Manic is somewhat disturbing and filmed in a way that makes it hard to watch, but the performances are just about as good as it gets and make this film worth seeing.",3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078,1376092800,"08 10, 2013",2013,1715,"['Lyle', 'Jensen', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'few', 'issues', 'anger', 'management', 'Most', 'time', 'complete', 'control', 'one', 'day', 'baseball', 'game', 'almost', 'kills', 'someone', 'Lyle', 'not', 'quite', 'eighteen', 'yet', 'sent', 'psychiatric', 'hospital', 'where', 'compared', 'others', 'problems', 'are', 'nothing', ""'ve"", 'said', ""'ll"", 'say', 'again', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'single', 'most', 'underrated', 'appreciated', 'actor', 'Hollywood', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'films', 'are', 'great', 'are', 'awful', 'fact', 'always', 'strong', 'performance', 'even', 'worst', 'movie', 'much', 'better', 'Manic', 'was', 'rare', 'inside', 'look', 'youth', 'psychiatric', 'facility', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'story', 'course', 'meet', 'Lyle', 'other', 'patients', 'finding', 'out', 'why', ""'re"", 'there', 'there', 'really', ""n't"", 'point', 'quality', 'film', 'further', 'decreases', 'way', 'was', 'filmed', 'scene', 'constant', 'movement', 'numerous', 'angles', 'Similar', 'camcorder', 'films', 'honestly', 'found', 'pretty', 'distracting', 'not', 'mention', 'nauseating', 'best', 'part', 'Manic', 'though', 'clearly', 'performances', 'was', 'released', '2001', 'stars', 'were', 'household', 'names', 'however', 'seeing', 'film', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'became', 'popular', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'actor', ""n't"", 'get', 'recognition', 'playing', 'Doctor', 'Manic', 'glue', 'everyone', 'together', 'Even', 'JGL', 'performance', 'film', 'mess', 'nonsense', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Manic', 'somewhat', 'disturbing', 'filmed', 'way', 'hard', 'watch', 'performances', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'make', 'film', 'seeing']",Manic
