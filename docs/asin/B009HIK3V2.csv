As my review title states, there is more talk than action, but the action sequences are good and entertaining.  One sore spot with me is that Bruce Willis was given first billing as the star, yet in the film he is nothing more than a paper pusher office detective who does not see any action.  He contributes very little to the general plot, and ZERO to the few action sequences.  Gosh, the producers could have used a fifth-rate, unknown actor from Iowa at 5% the cost of Willis, and the plot would have moved along just as well.  But I guess they just wanted to capitalize on his famous name, not caring that they were actually deceiving the movie viewers.  Makes me think this macho-man hero is getting too old and can't fight bad guys anymore (just like Steven Siegal).  No more Willis movies for me.

Though the film starts out promisingly, it later degenerates into a series of predictabilities, unrealisms, too-easies, and general corninesses, with dialogue that becomes flatter and less realistic as it proceeds.

But the script here is stupid to the point it barely reaches above bad.Here's the scoop. Jeremy Coleman is a fireman in Long Beach. One night he's in a convenience store when Nazi thugs enter and kill the owner and the owner's son because they won't sign over the store lease.  He escapes and can rat on the group's leader (Vince D'Onofrio) but will need to go into protective custody. He agrees and, in the process, falls for his guardian U.S. Marshall (Rosario Dawson) when everything falls apart. Seems D'Onofrio is very resourceful and can track him and her down and kill both. Now our hero firefighter must fight ""Fire with Fire."" (right)What a screw-up. This script is dumb beyond the meaning of the word. There are so many lapses in logic and procedure it's difficult to imagine how it ever got a green light. In one scene the marshals leave the hero alone which allows him to escape. Is that S.O.P.? It is also cliche ridden. This scenario has been done before. Many times. You need something really clever to raise it above the fray and that isn't happening here. It's one plodding, dumb scene after another.Bruce Willis is on hand as a detective out to get D'Onofrio. Why is Bruce doing this part? He looks tired and bored. Does he really need the paycheck? I liked Josh Duhamel in ""Transformers"" but he just doesn't have the gravity to pull off the hero role here. I'm in love with Rosario Dawson but her role here is nowhere near deep enough for her to rap her talent around. The only standout part for me was D'Onoforio. He was the only character written with any depth. The directing never rose above hack level and all the production values were assembly line.I knew this wasn't going to be great when I went in but I expected more than this. I expected at least some level of competency, but it just wasn't happening.

My biggest complaint is that i bought it instead or renting it via Netflix, cuz this is a one shot deal.

I counted three times when the heroes (a fireman who saw murders committed and a nicely-shaped US marshal who falls for the big lug) scuffle and lose their weapons and watch them skid across the smooth floor. Once, maybe, not three times in a movie. Willis could have been replaced with a cardboard cutout and we would have gotten the same visual results. Time for him to retire.One major plus, the bad guy and his pack of blood-thirsty goons are terrific. They radiate evil and you want them to perish by the sword and slowly. I won't give away the main villain's name but he was in 'Full Metal Jacket' and he was masterful as the head whacko - one problem, not enough mayham by the vicious pack of mad dogs to really make them stand out among mad dog movie killeers - still, not too shabby as bad guys often make the film memorable.Basic plot line that has been run over by Hollyweird writers scores of times over the decades, tired dialog and lots of mumbling draw this one down two stars and that modern director's flawed fast, lets strain older viewer's eyeballs type camera work knocks this down another half star.

1596708,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B009HIK3V2,Mark Turner,"[4, 5]","I like Josh Duhamel. I thought he made the TV series LAS VEGAS interesting when he was there and he certainly fit the bill when he starred in the TRANSFORMER films. Why he hasn't been used more as a leading man I'll never know, but if his output is limited to direct to DVD films then I don't expect him to become the major player he should.This brings me to FIRE WITH FIRE, the latest direct to DVD flick to highlight the fact it was produced by the same people who brought you RIGHTEOUS KILL and 16 BLOCKS. Come on folks, we really don't care who produces a film because for the most part that's rarely a guarantee that the film will be any good. Fortunately here it turns out that it is.Duhamel plays Jerry Coleman, a good guy and a fire fighter who witnesses a murder at the local quick mart after stopping in for snacks. The owner and his son are shot and killed in front of Jerry and only through some quick thinking does he escape only to be wounded in the process. Jerry goes to the police and with the sketch they do of the suspect the case pulls in Det. Mike Cella (Bruce Willis). The killer is David Hagan (Vincent D'Onofrio), a white supremacist who killed Cella's partner years ago. Released for that crime, Cella wants desperately to put him behind bars. With Jerry's testimony he can do that.But things start off bad and eventually get worse. While in a line up to be identified, Hagan lets Jerry know he knows who he is and where he can find him. The D.A. offers Jerry witness protection via the U. S. Marshall Service and he takes the offer. His identity erased from all databases and moved to New Orleans, 8 months go by and the trial date is approaching. But that's not all that's happened.While being guarded, Jerry has fallen in love with his protector in the Marshall Service, Talia Durham (Rosario Dawson). A big no no in the Service, she plans on moving back to his home town once the case is settled. Too bad Hagan was able to find their location and send in a hit man to kill them both. With Durham wounded, Jerry is able to contact the Marshall Service for help. Though they plan on protecting him more thoroughly this time a phone call from Hagan prompts Jerry to decide to stop running and take the man on on his own terms.Dropping his agents, Jerry makes his way back home. Knowing that Hagan has been trying to take over turf held by the Crips, Jerry approaches them for a weapon. Once he's armed, he sets out to make sure that he gets Hagan before Hagan can get him.So the revenge film is set in motion and the side characters offer nice support in this film that actually turns out to be quite well done. The look of the film is completely professional and looks slick. The acting is believable by all involved here. And the story isn't near as thin as a number of main stream major releases seen of late.Going in I think that most people will know what to expect from this film. Willis has taken on the duties of packing the deck in a number of low budget films in the past few years and my guess is he's trying to pay back helping others on the way up. His name will draw viewers to this film even though he isn't the main focus of the film. But once you get started with this movie you'll find yourself drawn in and watch from beginning to end. It's not a bad movie and you'll get your money's worth with a rental.",3,STANDARD DIRECT TO DVD ACTION FLICK,1352764800,"11 13, 2012",2012,3350,"['like', 'Josh', 'Duhamel', 'thought', 'made', 'TV', 'series', 'LAS', 'VEGAS', 'interesting', 'when', 'was', 'there', 'certainly', 'fit', 'bill', 'when', 'starred', 'TRANSFORMER', 'films', 'Why', ""n't"", 'been', 'used', 'more', 'leading', 'man', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'output', 'limited', 'direct', 'DVD', 'films', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'become', 'major', 'player', 'should.This', 'FIRE', 'WITH', 'FIRE', 'latest', 'direct', 'DVD', 'flick', 'highlight', 'fact', 'was', 'produced', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'brought', 'RIGHTEOUS', 'KILL', '16', 'BLOCKS', 'Come', 'folks', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'who', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'rarely', 'guarantee', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'Fortunately', 'here', 'out', 'plays', 'Jerry', 'Coleman', 'good', 'guy', 'fire', 'fighter', 'who', 'murder', 'local', 'quick', 'mart', 'stopping', 'snacks', 'owner', 'son', 'are', 'shot', 'killed', 'front', 'Jerry', 'only', 'quick', 'thinking', 'escape', 'only', 'be', 'wounded', 'process', 'Jerry', 'police', 'sketch', 'do', 'suspect', 'case', 'Det', 'Mike', 'Cella', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'killer', 'David', 'Hagan', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'white', 'supremacist', 'who', 'killed', 'Cella', 'partner', 'years', 'ago', 'Released', 'crime', 'Cella', 'desperately', 'put', 'bars', 'Jerry', 'testimony', 'can', 'do', 'that.But', 'things', 'start', 'bad', 'eventually', 'get', 'worse', 'line', 'up', 'be', 'identified', 'Hagan', 'Jerry', 'know', 'who', 'where', 'can', 'find', 'D.A', 'offers', 'Jerry', 'witness', 'protection', 'U.', 'S.', 'Marshall', 'Service', 'offer', 'identity', 'erased', 'databases', 'moved', 'New', 'Orleans', '8', 'months', 'go', 'trial', 'date', 'approaching', 'not', 'happened.While', 'being', 'guarded', 'Jerry', 'fallen', 'love', 'protector', 'Marshall', 'Service', 'Talia', 'Durham', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'big', 'Service', 'moving', 'back', 'home', 'town', 'once', 'case', 'settled', 'Too', 'bad', 'Hagan', 'was', 'able', 'find', 'location', 'send', 'hit', 'man', 'kill', 'Durham', 'wounded', 'Jerry', 'able', 'contact', 'Marshall', 'Service', 'help', 'plan', 'protecting', 'more', 'thoroughly', 'time', 'phone', 'call', 'Hagan', 'prompts', 'Jerry', 'decide', 'stop', 'running', 'take', 'man', 'own', 'terms.Dropping', 'agents', 'Jerry', 'way', 'back', 'home', 'Knowing', 'Hagan', 'been', 'trying', 'take', 'over', 'turf', 'held', 'Crips', 'Jerry', 'weapon', 'armed', 'out', 'make', 'sure', 'Hagan', 'Hagan', 'can', 'get', 'him.So', 'revenge', 'film', 'set', 'motion', 'side', 'characters', 'offer', 'nice', 'support', 'film', 'actually', 'out', 'be', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'look', 'film', 'completely', 'professional', 'slick', 'acting', 'believable', 'involved', 'here', 'story', ""n't"", 'near', 'as', 'thin', 'number', 'main', 'stream', 'major', 'releases', 'seen', 'late.Going', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'film', 'Willis', 'taken', 'duties', 'packing', 'deck', 'number', 'low', 'budget', 'films', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'guess', 'trying', 'pay', 'back', 'helping', 'others', 'way', 'up', 'name', 'will', 'draw', 'viewers', 'film', 'even', ""n't"", 'main', 'focus', 'film', 'once', 'get', 'started', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'find', 'drawn', 'watch', 'beginning', 'end', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'get', 'money', 'worth', 'rental']",N/A

I hate when a movie leaves the audience with a question, especially if that question pertains to the status of the main characters. It is a fatal flaw that I believe some film makers do not grasp. If I spend 90 minutes or so watching the story unfold, it makes sense that I am interested in something about the story... Since I am interested in the story, it makes further sense that I want to know about the problems the characters are dealing with, how they respond, and what happens to them. Does the cowboy win the battle and the girl and ride off into the sunset? Does ET call home and get through? Does Batman and Robin escape the trap the Joker snared them in?  That is why I will tune in tomorrow night, same Bat time, same Bat channel. So it kindly torques my constitution when I give the writer/director my undivided time to follow the story, care about the characters, cheer them on and pray they are victorious...only to leave the theater wondering what happened to them. I want the story to have a solid ending, a firm conclusion. I want to know what really happened. The story was a little bit weak in that it was highly implausible. I will not drop spoilers. But I will just say that more time should have been spent on the front end, demonstrating that the hero didn't go from Common Joe to Billy Bad Ass overnight with little or no training. Bruce Willis' role is rather limited and more of a supporting nature. That was a let down as I have grown accustomed use to Bruce kicking bad guy rear-end.Fifty-Cent has a minor supporting role, a cameo really, sporting a 1973 Jim Kelly look, which was kind of comical. I expected him to say: ""Man, you come right out of a comic book!""The Fiver-Star winner in this movie was Bonnie Somerville. I was unfamiliar with her prior to this movie.

The movie when you break it down is just another vigilante type revenge movie but again because it's so fast paced and entertaining you can't stop watching. Also Vincent D'Onofrio gives such a great performance in this that watching for just for him is almost enough to keep you till the end.

Though he has agreed to testify against a violent mobster David Hagan (Vincent D'Onofrio), Jeremy decides that it is up to him to protect those he loves from the sociopathic Hagan, so he takes some extreme measures, despite the advice from Rosario Dawson's deputy marshal assigned to the case (who is also Jeremy's girlfriend).""Fire with Fire"" is a typical case of straight-to-DVD films, with a few A-list actors in a B movie format.
