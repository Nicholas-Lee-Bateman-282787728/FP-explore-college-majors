But I just watched the complete Smallville season six over a 3-day period, and I felt compelled to add my comments.I can't remember when I've enjoyed a series of television so much.  The show had already matured quite well by its fifth season, but this year it really kicked into high gear.  I admit, I was slow to warm up to Oliver Queen and his super alter-ego Green Arrow.  I was thinking, ""C'mon, can't the writers think of enough for Clark to do?""  But by the time Queen brought together all the young Justice Leaguers in the episode ""Justice,"" I knew that I would miss him when he was gone.And not to take even more away from the future Man of Steel, but two other series regulars really got a chance to grow this year.  Lois was given a love interest, which nicely rounded out some the charater's rougher edges.  And Allison Mack as Chloe had her best year yet, getting a meaty subplot (not to mention a boyfriend) of her own, and becoming more intergral than ever in helping Clark embrace his destiny.As I said above, I watched the entire season in three days.  So it's hard for me to really pick a single favorite episode.  There's basically 2 or 3 ongoing story arcs, with nary a weak link among them.  As always, the season finale leaves you on the edge of your seat.  In this case, it includes the debut of another super-villain from the comics.Season six is Smallville at its best.

1053917,A1F9KLKV2H5TLS,B000N6SE4U,Amazon Customer,"[3, 3]","I severely went off Smallville for a while, It seemed that the series was never going anywhere. The characters were continually doing circles around each other in every episode. You'd get the pouty looks between Clarke and Lana during discussions abut they're relationship.  Since season 3, roughly 88 episodes give or take a few,  of them being together/not together, it got old!!! It killed itself for me!!! What I hated most was that they created such wonderful stories and managed to undone and dismiss them by the end of that episode.Story line like Brainiac, who was introduced to us as a big character, just disappeared, popped up at the end, then disappeared for good. Alicia, Clarkes super power girlfiend that they introduce in season 4... killed in the epidose after, in such a lame, pathectic excuse of a story. The bad Kryptonians that arrive at the beginning of season 5 - gone by the end of the episode and everything was back to normal. Just like the beginning of season 6, where Zod had taken over Lex's body and appeared to have started an apocolypse - undone in less than an episode - it was a great shame, cus these stories that they seem to be so scared of, could stretch into 2 or 3 episodes or leave a lasting influence on the future stories.But having a year or two out has helped a lot, i rejoined the series in season 6 and it had improved on it's typical formula. You still get the filler between scenes where Clarke will be with Lex in an obviously rehersed argument. pout, then go. But dispite these flaws, I still REALLY, REALLY want to LOVE it! The characters have they're great moments, maily Chloe and Lois, who hold the scenes with they're well played characters. I still think they should kill Lana, her character still isn't needed! This series they introduce new main characters - one of which was super hero Green Arrow, who's very welcome to bring a new dimension to the series, that the characters cant do on they're own. I just hope that they do more with long lasting story lines, that span the series. Let's hope, cus season 7 looks to be awesome!p.s.

Green arrows, that is.Justin Hartley joins the regular Smallville cast as Oliver Queen/Green Arrow, billionaire business tycoon by day, daring Robin Hood do-gooder by night.At first I wasn't sure what to think when I heard Green Arrow was going to have a place in Smallville's continuity. Of course, I was, like, ""Hey, cool, another superhero joins the show and this one actually wears his costume!"" Whereas the other part of me was, like, ""What does Green Arrow have to do with Superman growing up, again?"" All I can say without giving anything away is having Green Arrow join the show was a brilliant move. Not only does he demonstrate a good example for Clark, but his past and present conflicts with Lex Luthor also add a nice twist to the storyline.Of particular note this season was the episode, ""Noir,"" where everything was in black and white and took place in the '30s. Reminded me a bit of the Lois and Clark episode that did the same thing, but Smallville's was much better written and not as cheesy.The over-arcing storyline of the phantoms that escaped from the Phantom Zone was cool and gave Smallville its trademarked horror-esque twist, but without continually going into Twilight Zone territory like it usually did.I should add there was one more green element to this season: Martian Manhunter, played by Phil Morris. The only downside, though, was no alien visage but rather his shape-shifted human form instead. Oh well. The budget can only go so far, I suppose. Still, would have been cool if Martian Manhunter had more screen time, but this isn't his series.The only thing that I didn't like about this season was Lex and Lana getting together. It really bothered me and didn't make much sense when looking back over the first five seasons. This is the reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars.Recommended.A.P.

It started out feeling rejuvenated and exciting due to the addition of some new characters and interesting plot twists, then halfway through the season, lost some of its steam. For the most part, however, it was quite a fun ride. Season 6 included two of the most exciting events in Smallville's history: the formation of the Justice League, and Lex Luthor finally embracing his dark side and becoming the villian we all know from the comic books. This season was filled with all sorts of juicy storylines with the love triangle between Clark Kent, Lana Lang and Lex Luthor (Who would have ever thought?), and the introduction of Green Arrow as a love interest for Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen as a love interest for Chloe. Another exciting guest character this season was the Martian Manhunter, who previously worked for Clark's biological father Jor-El and was sent to aide Clark in his journey. The season ended with quite a bang that left many interesting possible storylines to explore in season 7. The fallout will likely result in one or more characters no longer having recurring roles on the show and a very different Smallville to look forward to next season.",4,"Uneven, but very eventful!",1180051200,"05 25, 2007",2007,1223,"['other', 'season', 'one', 'had', 'ups', 'downs', 'started', 'out', 'feeling', 'rejuvenated', 'exciting', 'due', 'addition', 'new', 'characters', 'interesting', 'plot', 'twists', 'then', 'halfway', 'season', 'lost', 'steam', 'most', 'part', 'however', 'was', 'quite', 'fun', 'ride', 'Season', '6', 'included', 'two', 'most', 'exciting', 'events', 'Smallville', 'history', 'formation', 'Justice', 'League', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'finally', 'embracing', 'dark', 'side', 'becoming', 'villian', 'know', 'comic', 'books', 'season', 'was', 'filled', 'sorts', 'juicy', 'storylines', 'love', 'triangle', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Who', 'would', 'have', 'ever', 'thought', 'introduction', 'Green', 'Arrow', 'love', 'interest', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'love', 'interest', 'Chloe', 'exciting', 'guest', 'character', 'season', 'was', 'Martian', 'Manhunter', 'who', 'previously', 'worked', 'Clark', 'biological', 'father', 'Jor-El', 'was', 'sent', 'aide', 'Clark', 'journey', 'season', 'ended', 'bang', 'left', 'many', 'interesting', 'possible', 'storylines', 'explore', 'season', '7', 'fallout', 'will', 'likely', 'result', 'one', 'more', 'characters', 'no', 'longer', 'having', 'recurring', 'roles', 'show', 'very', 'different', 'Smallville', 'look', 'forward', 'next', 'season']",Smallville: Season 6

When a co-worker told me it was his only ""can't miss"" show I rented Season One. I was totally hooked and now OWN every season.Since I watched the whole series in order, the character/plot progression has been fascinating. The relationships and character development really MAKE the show.Lex and his slow slide to the dark side is more interesting because we see how it happens... how twisted and tragic his upbringing was. Clark's rich relationship with his parents is such a great contrast to Lex and Lionel, (I really missed Johnathan) and his growth toward his ""destiny"" has been so real (relatable even) and compelling.Smallville has put it's own unique spin on Clark Kent/Superman and that's ok... In fact, it's been great. It seems like some people are so obsessed with the ""Superman myth"" they know, that they can't let go and enjoy... Too bad.It's been a great ride and I want to see where THIS story goes. Clark and Lana have so much on screen chemistry that I'm halfway expecting my T.V. to start smoking every time they're in the same room! Wanting to see them get together STILL keeps me watching. At this point, it's going to be a tragedy if they DON'T wind up together... and knowing the way that Superman's story is ""supposed"" to go... It's really TOO BAD.Chloe is a great character that is also unique to Smallville and I love her as Clark's ""sidekick"" and hope she continues to develop. Lois... is an  interesting character too, but as Superman's future soul-mate, she's weak. Clark's relationship and SMOKING HOT chemistry with Lana is so much stronger, I'm really not feeling it with Lois at all. Which is is ok... because this is another unique ""take"" on the story.But I'm sure at some point they will feel compelled to force these characters into their traditional roles and I'm not sure how they will get there from here.Having to stomach seeing Lana with Lex was difficult in season six, but I can't think of one episode that I didn't want to watch again.

However, I always felt its placement on the WB/CW lineup kind of drags the show down in that it repeat a lot of the flaws present on the other soap opera-ish shows the network does a lot. While season 5 was a pretty stellar season with a lot of consistency, season 6 has great moments filled with some new character introductions but they're surrounded by rather lackluster or underwhelming episodes.The season opens with the premiere ""Zod"" with Clark trapped in the Phantom Zone and Zod having taken over Lex's body who has turned Metropolis into a warzone. Clark, with the help of another Kryptonian named Raya escapes the Zone but not before accidentally unleashing so-called ""Phantoms"" on Earth. Zod is stopped and Clark has to deal with the phantoms while also dealing with some relationship issues.One of the biggest introductions to this season was Oliver Queen - aka the Green Arrow - with a troubled history with Lex and develops a relationship with Lois. Probably one of the best recurring characters the show has, he's played with tons of charm by Justin Hartley and finally gives Clark a kick in the *** about helping people rather than being whiny about Lana. Speaking of Lana, even though her relationship with Lex takes a big curve away from the comics, it's also developed realistically and it's nice to see the Lutherness rub off on her.One of the problems with this season is that the episodes surrounding great comic book moments aren't fairly stellar on their own. Martian Manhunter makes some appearances and his first one just happens to be at the end of a bland storyline of Clark's while ""Justice"" sounds cool and it's awesome to see this kind of tagteam action, it also has the flimsiest of plots and rather awful dialogue. However the show gets saved by its predictably-awesome finale ""Phantom"" where it appears several characters bite the big one and Clark takes on the last phantom which turns out to be a classic from of his rogue gallery.In the special features, there's a featurette dealing with the diehard fans of Smallville. Well, as a personal criticism it runs a little long, but I'm curious as to how reviews like this which praise-but-comment and whether people can overlook flaws.

With Johnathan Kent's passing and Martha Kent's run as state senator, it leaves Clark little reason to stay in Smallville. But if Clark were to leave Smallville, what's to keep the show going? More importantly, what would become of the rest of the cast? Well never fear, for the writers come up with a rather half-baked idea of rogue phantoms escaping from the Phantom Zone giving Clark yet another reason to stay in Smallville.Now it'll sound as if I'm totally bashing the sixth season. Rest assured that that's the furthest thing from my mind. The season was well acted, well paced, and overall well played. It's just that this season saw Clark taking a backseat.Since we know Clark won't move on until the phantom business is over with, we're instead treated to the debacle that is Lex and Lana's marriage.  In between their slew of lies and deceit, we find Lana (surprise surprise) still has strong feelings for Clark. We also learn that Chloe might just be a contestant for the ""wall of weird"" (why it took six seasons to reveal this possibility I'll never know). Lois finally starts working for the Daily Planet. And in between all this, Clark fights some phantoms.To help spice up the rather dullness that is Clark's life in this season, the last phantom just so happens to be a fan favorite from the Superman mythos. But much like the Clark/Zod confrontation, the villain will probably meet their demise all too quickly at the start of the seventh season.Despite the rants, this season was entertaining.

They are scattered all over the earth and start their spree of killing and destruction. He also has a battle with Zod (who's using Lex's body) to fight Clark and later in the season he has another epic battle with a seriously powerful escapee in Titan.  As he decimates all others that came before him.  In between that you have the Lana/Lex thing going with more drama than a daytime soap opera and Chloe gets her a man in Jimmy Olsen (Aaron Ashmore) who also works at the Daily Planet along with her.You also have Lois who has off and on relationship with Oliver Queen (Justin Hartley) who also has a few secrets of his own.  Being the Green Arrow fighting crime and going up against Lex.  He's done so much dirt in this season that you fill up the Grand Canyon and still have room for more.  Also a romance (albeit forced) in Lois and Clark when she gets this special lipstick that makes her fall in love with the first guy she sees.  Of course it's gotta be Clark and madness, excitement and drama ensue as they interrupt Lana/Lex's engagement party and drop a secret or two on the other folks who have no idea that Lana is pregnant(there's another story line covering that as well).  Also Clark gets a surprise visit from one Martian Manhunter.There are loads of excellent episodes rounding out Season 6 of Smallville and if Season 7 is anything like the ending to this one.  Then we are in for one excellent ride with all the characters and a couple situations that will hopely get resolved early on.

So each season sees him growing in power and abilities, and we journey with him towards his destiny. So unless the writers screw up big time, you're going to follow this series if you are a fan of Superman.That said, how was this season six?This season opener was a bit of a let down. After all the build up in the last season of having Zod possess Lex, the denouement was a bit of an anti-climax.But I guess we can't just have Lex and Clark duke it out the whole season. There would be lots of continuity and secret identity issues then.Introducing the Green Arrow and having a proto-JLA makes for interesting storyline, and reinforces the message to Clark that he is meant for bigger things beyond just Smallville and Metropolis.Other familiar super-powered characters - friend and foe - draws upon the rich legacy of the Superman mythos.However, I wonder if the writers are painting themselves into a corner by introducing so many of the future characters. While Clark has been trying to keep a low profile to hide his powers, he can't exactly be described as ""mild-mannered"" in this series. The numerous times he has burst into Lex's living room (opening both double doors dramatically!) hardly reflect a mild-mannered character. Lois and Jimmy now already know Clark and the person that he is. How will Clark become ""mild-mannered"" in the future?The ""noir"" episode shows this up nicely. In the dream sequence, Clark is a mild-mannered reporter, and his portrayal is quite a distance from the confident Clark in the series.Still, perhaps the series will carve new grounds and new mythos. When superman was re-imagined in the 80s, his adoptive parents survived and was a source of strength and support for him.In this re-imagining, he loses his adoptive father. Perhaps the future Superman does not hide his true identity from his closest friends like Lois and Jimmy?

The first episode of the season is enough to get attention when it is about Clark escaping the Phantom Zone to then fight Zod, but it just keeps getting better.

The 5th Season was a little better but Season 6 was an all time low.Where do I begin from the re-hash of old ideas (Freaks, Red Kryptonite, main character fasking death) to characters acting out of character (Martha, Chloe, CLARK).The worst thing though is that Clark has actually taken a huge backwards step towards being Superman. I CANNOT SEE THIS BIG DUMB ALIEN BEING THE MAN OF STEEL.Why...?He kills... SUPERMAN DOES NOT KILL...!He still after SIX YEARS pines for Lana... WHAT ABOUT JOHANTHAN KENT DEAD FOR OVER A YEAR & HARDLY MENTIONED!!!Also he gets upstaged IN HIS OWN SHOW by characters like LAAAANA & The GREEN ARROW.Another problem is character development.Yes it's good that Lois is now into journalism BUT PLEASE NOT BY LIGHT SWITCH FOR GOD'S SAKE!!!!Also Lex another character who has seemingly LIGHT SWITCHED to evil!!!The baby plot line was the most stupid plot line ever conceived in the history of PLOTS all it served to do was to make Lana look like a victim. But I repeat really I'll repeat LANA IS NOT A VICTIM SHE CHOSE TO BE WITH LEX ON HER OWN FREE WILL KNOWING THAT LEX DID SOME SHADY DEALINGS. Either that or the writers want us to think she's stupid!!!The worst moment of the show though came on the episode Prototype or 6:21 when Martha is leaving to be State Senitor BECAUSE SHE KNOWS A RICH BUSINESSMAN WHO HAPPENS TO KNOW CLARKS SECRET. Clark gives his blessing saying 'That's what Dad would have wanted.' Yes one of the few times Johnathan Kent's name was mentioned!!!But this is all wrong because remember six years back at a certain Pilot episode & after Clark had saved Lex from the bridge Lex brought Clark a car but JOHNATHAN KENT told Clark to give back the car because... 'WASN'T SAVING A LIFE ENOUGH???'What a sad pathetic excuse of a SUPERMAN this Clark is becoming I'm sure Johnathan was spining in his grave as Clark gave that sad excuse of a speech!!!The season really has some real stinkers & some of the worst of the shows entire history!!!Well here's a list!!!6:3 Wither- Stupid Vine Lady Phantom who'd just as well be a FOTW!!!6:7 Rage- Drugs serim episode that's been done over a million times!!!6:8 Static- One of the worst episodes ever!!!6:9 Subterranean- Perhaps the worst episode ever!!!!6:12 Labyrinth- Clark has a trip in his head. Lana tries to kill him. So BDA decides at the end that he must be in love with Lana???6:14 Tresspass- Yet another Lana stalker episode!!!6:21 Prototype- CLARK KILLS AGAIN!!!And others that were nearly as bad6:2 Sneeze- Cheesey excuse of an episode just to introduce a super power!!!6:5 Reunion- Boring Lex & Ollie episode!!6:6 Fallout- The Bow Wow show= Stupid alien who kills people for no reason at all!!!6:17 Combat- CLARK KILLS AGAIN!!!6:18 Progeny- Moya Sullivan comes to Smallville & err... nothing else of importance really happens!!!That's 11 poor episodes that's half the season.The rest was ok but there were episodes (a few) that were worth watching!!!6:1 Zod- Zoooood6:11 Justic- Cool action!! What show the should be going towards instead of stupid Soap Opera nonsense!!!6:16 Promise- Cool episode, with interesting format & shock yet interesting ending (AKA Characters moving forward instead of being static like they basically were for this entire season!!!TO CONCLUDEAl-Miles please read a comic or at least research on WHAT SUPERMAN IS before you even start thinking of writing a 7th Season...HAVECLARK MOVING TOWARDS HIS DESTINYLEX BECOMING MORE EVIL, AKA OBSESSED WITH SAVING THE WORLD BUT IN HIS OWN TWISTED WAY (This was one of the few highlights of Season 6).CHARACTERS PROGRESSING & MOVING FOWARD.BUILDING STORIES EPISODE BY EPISODE TO EVENTUALLY LEAD TO ONE GIGANTIC EPISODE (WATCH BABYLON 5 FOR THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THAT!!!)DON'T HAVEPEOPLE LOVING LANA OR CLARK OR LEX OR ANYONE IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HER THEN GET RID OF HER!!!CLARK KILLING PEOPLE. THIS IS SUPERMAN NOT BATMAN!!!OTHER CHARACTERS FROM SUPERMAN MITHOS BEFORE THEY ARE MEANT TO BE INTRODUCED JUST TO HAVE SHORT TERM HIGH VIEWERS!!!!ANY SOAP OPERA RUBBISH AKA ANGST, PEOPLE ACTING CRAZY JUST TO SERVE THE PLOT!!!JIMMY OLSEN...

1053968,ACKDSX71VI5HY,B000N6SE4U,"Gregory N. Perkins ""wide reader""","[0, 0]","SPOILERS FOLLOWThe sixth season of ""Smallville"" is extremely good, stacking the deck with many truly compelling episodes.  Beginning with the season premiere ""Zod,"" it explores elements of the ""Superman"" saga the show had never before addressed.  As a rule, episodes are solid, though a few characters could have been left out or handled differently.I'm thinking mainly of the terrible Phantom Zone escapee storyline.  Casting was awful for most of the 'Zoners,' as the show's writers insisted on calling them, being mostly beefy professional wrestlers who could barely act in a style conducive to the show.  As a comparison, Terence Stamp, Sarah Douglas, and Jack O'Halloran were absolutely perfect as General Zod, Ursa, and Non, respectively, in the first two ""Superman"" films.  I don't mean to discount the actors here because they happen to be wrestlers because I respect pro wrestling as entertainment and I know what wrestlers' bodies endure.  But in this case it was bad stunt casting.Shows that work well are ""Promise,"" ""Fallout,"" ""Zod,"" ""Nemesis,"" and ""Arrow,"" among many others.  Shows that didn't pan out well were ""Labyrinth,"" ""Noir,"" and ""Wither,"" among others.  Overall, this is a very solid season highlighted by the arrivals of Jimmy Olsen and Oliver Queen/The Green Arrow in great guest-starring turns by Aaron Ashmore and Justin Hartley, respectively.

There are finally a lot of guest stars who are worth seeing, primarily in the Justice League episode.  Though why they use ""Impulse"" instead of ""Flash"" bothers me more than a little.  It was excellent to have Green Arrow playing a truly necessary part in the series as a whole by pushing Clark to realize that while he is great at protecting those close to him, there is an entire world full of other people in need.  Seeing Clark move toward his eventual destiny as Superman is something that has been needed for a couple seasons now.After the disaster of the fifth season, which started off good but plummeted after the craptacular way Pa Kent was killed while Clark simultaneously totally blew things with Lana, this season kept me on the edge of my seat as I watched the discs.  (You see, there is no local CW station for me to watch the series as it airs, so it was a year between seeing new material for me, and this season did not disappoint, even with it's slower episodes.)As with all TV shows, this season had some forgettable episodes, but most of these were great.  What motivated me not to award five stars, which the season itself truly deserves, is that the DVD set has nothing worth mentioning in terms of special features.  There are deleted scenes from a number of episodes, but there are no commentaries by the creators or stars in the whole set.  I can understand that cast interviews would be a bit repetitive after six seasons, but the commentaries are a favorite of mine.Anyway, it's a good season to watch, and some of the deleted scenes are good to see as well.

1053980,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B000N6SE4U,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[5, 9]","Smallville season 6 starts out where season 5 ended. Zod is still in Lex's body causing havoc on earth. While Clark is trapped in the Phantom Zone. There he meets the hot Rayla (Pascale Hutton) who claims she knew his father and that he sent her to the Phantom Zone when Krpyton was going to explode. She helps him find his way out but when he leaves others follow. He then comfronts Zod and is able to stop him with something Rayla gave him. Lex is of course back to normal with no memory what so ever of what happened with Clark.We then get more and more of the depressing Lana and Lex relationship as the season goes on. We get a gross love scene between the two after Lana decides to move in with Lex. She then starts to dress and act like she's this great independent rich girl when she's a free loader. The episode Static is pretty bad too. Where Lex is well, turnt to static and no one can see him. So we get a lot of, where are you Lana, I love you!. Where are you Lex, I love you! It's bound to make you itchy since their relationship is pretty lame.Yes it's good that Lana finally sees Lex as the slime ball he is a few episodes before the season finale. But to me their relationship didn't end soon enough. Justin Hartley is at least fresh to the show and saves some of the earlier season episodes as the Green Arrow. He's so good as him that he should've gotten a spin-off series. I mean CW never aired his Aquaman series after all. But the episodes do make Lois look like an idiot. I mean it takes her forever and ever to realize the person she's falling for is the Green Arrow who she despises. With him around though we at least get a good episode that shows him and Lex as kids where he's not too nice to him. We also get a Justice League episode which isn't that bad. We also get some cool appearances by the Martian Manhunter but he's not used as much as the Green Arrow. He's around to help Clark take out the Phantoms.Through a lot of the season though Clark has like 2 second fights with the Phantom Zone aliens. I mean his fight with WWE's Batista is even disapointing in Static. We barely even get to see them fighting since the whole episode is about Lex and Lana's love....*pukes*. Anyway Clark's fights with meteor freaks sadly have lasted longer. Bow Wow makes a forgettable appearance as a kid playing basketball that a Phantom goes inside. He even sadly even gives Clark a better fight and kills the hot Rayla ""who I would've loved to seen more of"".Plus what is even sadder is that one of the best fights of the season is Chloe vs...Tori Spelling in a knock-out drag out cat fight. It's not until later in the season where we get a good fight between Clark and WWE's Kane.Also in this season Lana finally discovers Clark's secret. Although she's about as slow as Lois with finding out who the Green Arrow is. Actually she's a hell of a lot slower. Clark catches her when she falls through a glass ceiling and she's still basically like....duh...right up until she finally sees him use his powers for herself. She must be slow due to the 1000 concussions. The poor girl!Lana is also so slow due to all the concussions that it takes a good ammount of episodes to figure out there's actually no baby inside of her! lol. Yes that's right, Lex makes her think she's pregnant just so she'd marry him. He also lies to her face the entire season basically. She asks, Lex did you have something to do with this ? No Lana. Lex do you have a secret lab ? No Lana. Plus of course in a few episodes we get endings where it's reveiled that Lex was infact incharge of what he said he wasn't incharge of. I mean even an idiot could figure out he was incharge before it was reveiled. Well a viewer anyway because the not so bright Lana didn't see it coming. I mean she thought she could trust Lex more than Clark...haha.Lana is also pushed into marrying Lex when Lionel just says he'd kill Clark if she didn't. This is after she sees Clark use his powers too. Yet she's convinced right away that Lionel can kill Clark and stays to marry Lex. She told Clark she'd not marry Lex and that she wants to be with him. So Clark is heart-broken when she actually shows to the wedding. Clark hates Lex more than ever but of course, a few episodes later he's back to saving his life. Lex is trapped in a tunnel and Lionel gets Clark to go help him. Clark gets trapped too though since there's a whole lot of kryptonite down there. So that leaves Clark and Lex alone down there talking about where their friendship went wrong. What Clark doesn't know though is that Lana finally found out that Lex played her and that she wasn't pregnant. So in bad Lana and bad acting mode she was gonna let Lex die down there since she has the only map to how to get out of there.Anyway Chloe also finds out that she may infact have powers. We find out in the finale that she can heal with her tear drops. It might've actually drained her of her life though when she heals Lois. It would figure if the show killed the upbeat and the least whiney character. Someone was supposed to die in the finale but I don't think it was Lana. She finally stands up to Lex and gets slapped. So she goes to leave and her truck explodes but I think she's alive and well and faked her death. But I'd prefer if Chloe was still alive any day. Lionel breaks the news to Clark about Lana and Clark goes after Lex who he thinks killed Lana. But a dangerous phantom breaks loose out of one of Lex's labs and takes the form of Clark. So Bizarro is now on Smallville but we get a short fight between him and Clark before the episode ends. Don't worry though, I'm sure Clark will get rid of him in the season premiere just as quick as he got rid of Zod. The show could use more of a villian that isn't Lex but with Zod and Brainiac not used that well I'm sure Bizarro will have a short stay as well.",4,A Hit and Miss Season (Spoiler

1053986,APDUCWHP5J905,B000N6SE4U,Julia S.,"[0, 1]","Here is how season 6 should've been: Clark/Lana relationship/tension/drama is over...for good. Clark is in college and an intern/temp at Daily Planet along with Chloe. There he meets Lois Laine (instead of season 4) who is also in college and on the way to becoming a reporter, instead of a goal free ex army brat who lives off of the Kents. Lana is still on the show but she is a sub character, maybe her relationship with Lex wasn't a bad idea  if the goal was to put an end to her relationship with Clark but the writers screwed it up by bringing Clana back. The friendly rivalry between Clark and Lois wasn't a bad idea either, they need time to fall in love and Clark needs to start working towards his main goal instead of jumping all over the place.Here is a brief description of how the 6 seasons really were: Clark pining for Lana, Lana pining for Clark, and in between Clark discovers new powers, where he is from, finishes highschool and more pining for Lana and some more of that. I don't know why the writters insist on keeping the Clark/Lana relationship alive after 6 years which should have ended in season 3. That is when it was almost agonizing to watch them together. In every episode they find ways to not to be together, and when they finally get together they screw it up. Enough is enough! It might be too early for Clark to fall in love with Lois Laine at this point, but it doesn't mean that the Clana relationship has to continue being shoved down our throats with complete disregard for the real story of Superman.I don't have anything against the actress but i completely despise Lana Lang. She is boring, 1 dimentional, docile, incapable of protecting and standing up for herself, even after Lex taught her how to fight seasons ago. She continues playing a victim and begs Clark to trust her over and over again. In season 6 she finally showed potential to have a back bone by going from a victimized charity case to a calculating, self serving, black mailing bad girl, then she went back to playing a victim again. I can't think of a reason why Clark is still in love with her, they have absolutely no chemistry, it is obvious they do it because the script says so. It's understandable that she was his childhood/highschool love, but he is way out of highschool and he is already 20. Time to move on with the real story.It is understandable that Lana was his childhood/highschool love but he's been out of highschool for a while now and he is already 20. Time to move on with the real story.I agree with another viewer that Smallville is all played out and the show needs to take on a new form in Metropolis. Perhaps they need to start a whole new show from scratch without dragging a pointless neverending romance for years and creating filler freak of the week episodes.

There were numerous reasons for my anxiousness regarding this new season, the inclusion of Green Arrow (a popular DC Comics character) and Jimmy Olsen held interesting promise, also the resolution to the Zod plotline that was put into motion in the final episodes of season 5, plus just seeing where the creative minds behind this show were going to take us over the course of this new season. But, with all of my excitement there was a small amount of fear, because during the summer the network that had been the home of ""Smallville"" for 5 years, the WB, merged with UPN to form the new network the CW. This merger put many shows in possible jeopardy, leaving many to wonder what shows from the two networks would survive to make it to the new season. Thankfully, when all was said and done, ""Smallville"" was among the numerous series' from the WB to make it through, and by the end of season 6 had proven itself to be one of the CW networks highest rated shows of the season (no big surprise there).""Smallville: Season 6"" begins exactly where the 5th season left off, with the Kryptonian villain Zod attempting to take over the world while residing in the body of Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum). As if Zod's machinations weren't trouble enough, Metropolis is in the middle of deadly riots, Chloe (Allison Mack) is in considerable danger while trying to make her way to safety, Lana (Kristen Kruek) is standing by Lex's side, Martha (Annette O'Toole) and Lois (Erica Durance) awaken to find their plane about to crash, and the one man who has a chance of stopping the chaos, Clark (Tom Welling), is trapped in the Phantom Zone (Kryptonian prison for those who weren't aware). All of this is just in the first episode, throughout the season Clark must deal with his guilt over not being able to stop some of the devastation caused by Zod, while at the same time he discovers that his release from the Phantom Zone has brought some rather unexpected and nasty visitors with it. Lex is feeling somewhat remorseful over his part in the devastation that occurred in Metropolis, but his main concern is the continual manipulation of Lana as she gets closer and closer to him. Lois, however, gets to have some relief from the chaos of the first episode as she begins to fall for a new billionaire in town, Oliver Queen (Justin Hartley), who just so happens to be the hero known as the Green Arrow, and his reason for being in town is to stop Lex's project 33.1, the construction of an army of super soldiers. Clark and Oliver become friends over time and aid each other in times of need and in their quests to stop Lex's evil schemes from coming to fruition. Along the way Clark and Oliver enlist the aid of some fellow heroes, that Clark has previously had run-ins with, to assist them in destroying one of Lex's most active 33.1 facilities. With all of these events in one season, and many more that I didn't touch on, you'd think that would be enough to keep Clark and company busy, but you'd be wrong, for at the end of the season a new deadly foe is unleashed who is similar to Clark, only a little more bizzare.""Smallville"" continues to get better and better with each passing season, and this 6th season is no exception. The story arcs for the season were very engrossing, especially the Oliver Queen/Green Arrow arc and the capturing of all the escaped Phantoms from the Phantom Zone. The writers for this series continue to faithfully capture the essence of all the established DC Comics characters that have been on the show all along or have been introduced along the way.The cast for the show has never been better, all members really deliver great performances this season, not that season's past had been shoddy, but they all really get numerous moments to shine in this season. The new additions of Justin Hartley as Oliver Queen/Green Arrow and Aaron Ashmore as Jimmy Olsen were perfect for their respective parts, bringing new energy and shaking up the show in really interesting and fun ways.The special effects teams really had their work cut out for them this season, but not surprisingly they rose to the challenge and delivered some really cool visual effects that were fun to watch, especially in the episode 'Justice' where Oliver's team of heroes takes down a 33.1 facility. So many heroes in one episode, with each getting a moment to showcase their power was no doubt fun to write, but was probably a pain to come up with from a special effects standpoint, but the team did a great job, and the episode proved to be one of the best of the season. Two thumbs way up for this department's job on the show.All of the elements I mentioned in the previous 3 paragraphs combined together are what allows ""Smallville"" to continue to be an entertaining series that just keeps getting better and better. This is definitely a show that lives up to its hype, and is a must-see!""Smallville: Season 6"" is unrated and contains violence and mild language.",5,"In Smallville, Every Action Has A

It is NOT simply for kids or teens.  There are issues that are covered in the episodes that are inherent to everyone.  The plots are actually somewhat fresh and the acting is superb.  Surprisingly so.  Season 6 is particularly riveting.That said, I honestly believe that the producers have a problem.  As much as I have waited for it, there simply is no chemistry between Clark (Tom Welling) and Lois (Erica Durance).  Or perhaps it is that the chemistry between Lana (Kristin Kreuk) and Clark is so great that it absolutely overshadows all other relationships.Erica Durance (Lois) is a terrific young actress.  She is the epitomy of sexiness and enthusiasm...but in my opinion, the chemistry just isn't there with Tom/Clark.  And yet, surprisingly enough, this chemistry abounds between her and Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen/the Green Arrow).I just hope that the producers and ""Powers That Be"" of Smallville will leave the romance between Lois and Clark for a distant future and another series.  I'd hate to see them destroy this series by trying to ram this romance down our throats that clearly just isn't there.  They have discovered an amazing chemistry between Lana and Clark.

1053990,ATKQLQ3NLFW1H,B000N6SE4U,Kay,"[6, 10]","To begin, I like this show. Can't help it. This is one of the few television series I actually watch with any kind of frequency or deliberation. I enjoy the story, charaters, special effects, and a dozen other things...But like any real fan, I find myself discussing futilely with my family (who are also hooked) what should be changed. The series has gotten progressively darker and unlike in other seasons, the sixth season doesn't seem to have any feel-good episodes to releave the intensity. And also, this close to donning a cape and no one is going to recognize Clark? Time to pick up those glasses! And considering all the powers Clark has now, I wonder why the Robin Hood copycat (aka...) and his team weren't a little more impressed. I mean, he should be so out of their league! Still, I intend to buy it. Though there may be some episodes I woudn't care to watch too many more times, I especially enjoyed ""Sneeze"", ""Rage"", ""Subterranean"", ""Tresspass"", and ""Noir"" (Tom Welling does a great Clumsy Clark).

1053994,A2S9P70216QC2H,B000N6SE4U,"lenzino7383 ""BigBlue""","[0, 0]","Season Review-After 2 lackluster seasons, Smallville entered its sixth season with yet another epic, action packed, SFX extravaganza ""Zod"".  It's another one of the finest episodes of the series as we see Zod taking Lana hostage as he plans to create a new Krypton on Earth while Clark tries to survive the harsh intergalactic prison that is the Phantom Zone.  The episode ends by setting up the season with promising storylines, but will the writers actually deliver a quality season like they use to? For the most part, they do! While not as on par with the stunning second season and the thrilling third season, the sixth season of Smallville is certainly the series' most consistent season in years.  It saw the writers trying to change the series routine by adding some layers to the series.  One of those changes is the introduction of Oliver Queen.  Known in the DC comics As Green Arrow, the writers re-invent Oliver Queen and his green leather clad alter ego for Smallville and bring a fresh, even epic feel to the series.  Justin Hartley is great as the character as each week he grows stronger in the role. Oliver is also good mentor for Clark at this stage in his life as Oliver introduces the idea of not just saving the people that's close to him or in Smallville, but saving the millions across the world.  It's great watching this kind of interaction between the young heroes as it helps in Clark's journey toward his destiny.  ""Arrow"" is a stellar debut episode for the character filled with tons of gadgets, flying arrows, and action hero fun the series has ever had.  But if that wasn't good enough, this season also features the beginning of the Justice League in probably the best superhero team-up episode in live action, ""Justice"".  It's truly a classic comic book style episode as Clark teams up with Green Arrow when AC (Aquaman), Bart Allen (The Flash) and Victor Stone (Cyborg) return to stop Lex from building an army of meteor freaks. Those aren't only the superheroes that make an appearance this season.  We are also introduced to John Jones aka Martian Manhunter.  While underused for the most part of the season, Phil Morris is quite exceptional as the intergalactic bounty hunter who has been watching over Clark for years and now has finally shown himself so he help him on his journey.But it's not just a variety of superhero appearances that make this season worth the watch but it's the development of the characters and the storylines that develop throughout.  Lex Luthor is excellent as always as the writers continue to develop this future supervillian.  Lex really shines as the villain this year as his latest project 33.1 has him experimenting on meteor freaks as he plans to from an army.  Michael Rosenbaum continues to add layers to Lex as the writers continue to make Lex into the most fascinating character of the series.  Erica Durance's Lois get probably the best storyline for her character yet as Lois starts taking interest in journalism.  Becoming the amateur reporter for the Inquisitor, watching Lois developing her reporting skills is done nicely.  Then you have Chloe, who is as sharp as ever as Clark's superhero sidekick but it's Chloe's shocking revelation in the stunning episode ""Freak"" that really brings the character into her own again.  As Clark's only parent now, Annette `O Toole's Martha grow stronger as Clark's mother as well as struggling as Kansas' newest senator was great new role for the character.  John Glover is all kinds of brilliance as Lionel Luthor as the character seems to blur the line between good and evil throughout the season.  But the most surprising character development of the season is from none other than Lana! After 2 years of dreading the character, the writers manage to deal with the character in the right way.  With the awful introduction of the Lexana relationship at the end of the fifth season, I was surprised how well the relationship developed Lana's character.  Instead of Lex and Lana acting like soul mates, there was darkness and deception to they're relationship I liked.  It was obvious that the Luthor legacy was having and affect on Lana, making her more aware, even less gullible than she use to be.  You actually feel bad for all the things Lex puts Lana through, as she finds out exactly who Lex is.  Not to mention the fact, Lana finally unravels the truth about Clark in the heartbreaking wedding episode ""Promise"".  Lana's transformation from Girl next door to She-Lex was actually a convincing journey for the character, making the Lexana relationship having reason to be. Lastly, you have the introduction of Jimmy Olsen! While the character much older than he should, Aaron Ashmore has the geeky, lighthearted photographer person down and his developing relationship with Chloe is interesting to watch.My only problem with the season is Clark! While the writers give Clark a decent mission throughout the season with stopping the Phantoms that escaped from the Phantom Zone, the storyline is both disappointing and doesn't develop Clark's character.  The Phantoms are lousy villains with a combination of weak writing and lackluster guest stars (Rapper Bow Wow as a super powered nuclear radiator named Baern, WWE star David Bautista as a bone eating Phantom named Aldar and a powerful, ruthless Phantom named Titan played by WWE star Glen Jacobs.)  Instead of developing as a hero, Clark still remained as the love sick farm boy with his occasional hero acts.  But besides that, Season 6 has some superb individual episodes throughout the season: ""Sneeze"" is a fun, light-hearted episode where Clark develops his super breath, ""Crimson"" finds Clark and Lois wrecking havoc on red kryptonite, ""Labyrinth"" is a chilling episode where Clark finds himself powerless while in an insane asylum, Tori Spelling drops by as an over the top reporter in the hilarious ""Hydro"", ""Nemesis"" is a suspenseful episode centered around the Clex rivalry, ""Progeny"" features a memorable appearance from Linda Carter aka Wonder Woman, and then there's ""Phantom"", a strong season ender where the final Phantom turns out to be another classic Superman villain from the mythos. Rather there are the usual garbage episodes: a horrible poison ivy inspired Phantom in ""Wither"", an awful freak of the week episode in ""Static"", another pointless Lana stalker episode ""Trespass"", ""Noir"" is a sub-par tribute to 1940s cinema and ""Subterranean"" could be another runner-up for Smallville's worst episode with Clark protecting an illegal immigrant from a field digging meteor freak!  But unlike the past 2 years, there is a better quality here than there is bad, as Season 6 sees the writers actually developing the characters and the season moves the series a bit forward.  While the Clark still remains stagnant, the rest of the characters and storylines were solid, making this one of Smallville's best seasons.Season Rating: 8.5/10Video and Audio Review-All 22 episodes of Season 6 are clearer and prettier than ever in this widescreen lay out.  The audio is near perfection.Video and Audio Rating: 9.5/10Extras-This box set probably has my favorite collection of extras yet.  ""Green Arrow: Legend of the Emerald Archer"" featurette is an amazing documentary about the comic book history of the Green Arrow with many memorable commentators.  ""Smallville: Big Fans"" featurette is hilarious and very entertaining look on the bizarre, obsessive, yet loyal fan base Smallville has.  ""Smallville Legends: Justice and Doom"" is fun little interactive comic book showing the mini-adventures of Green Arrow and the rest of the Justice League. Although, ""Smallville Legends: the Oliver Queen Chronicles"" is a badly animated group of mini-episodes on Oliver's past, while ""The Making of Smallville Legends: The Oliver Queen Chronicles"" is a decent look at how the creators made this those episodes.  The deleted scenes are another mixed bag of great scenes that should have stayed and pointless material that deserved to be left out. But must admit, my favorite deleted scene is the one where Martian Manhunter finally introduces himself to Clark. Also, the sixth season is the only DVD box set without commentaries, which is very disappointing! I would have loved commentary on ""Zod"", ""Arrow"", ""Justice"", ""Phantom"" and other great episodes throughout this season. At least, have Justin Hartley describe how it was playing Green Arrow!Extras Rating: 8/10Overall Score: 9/10",5,Green Arrow's Debut and Phantoms Unleashed-Smallville's Complete Sixth

They start off good with the Season Premiere. And as usual, once they get your hopes up, they follow up the series with slow, dragging episodes. I think the whole ""I luv Lana, I need Lana, I can't live without Lana,"" thing is pretty old. I know that in the comics Clark and Lana hooked up in Smallville. And she also knows his secret when he becomes Superman. But for goodness sake, Get over the girl already. She has become so annoying in this show. I hope that (Spoiler)she's gone for good, even though we all know, or should now that she ain't dead. She obviously faked it (with the big white truck blocking Luthor, and the screen, from getting to her right before the car blows).Another thing I hate is how they produce one episode like ""Justice"" which introduces a mini-Justice League to get everybody hype and then leave you out to dry with some bad followup episodes. Oliver Queen (Green Arrow) was stealing the show with some great acting. I think he took the spotlight off of nice ol' Clark. 'Till they got rid of him. It seems like they save all the good stuff for the Season Premieres, one or two good episodes in the middle and the Season Finale. C'mon. That ain't right.And when is Clark gonna learn to fly. The only time he fly's is when someone takes over his body or he wears that stupid red ring. We are all getting tired of his running around all over the place. And when are they gonna stage some decent fight scenes for good ol' kid-Supes. 1 punch is not good enough for a future Superman. The cinematic style for the show has gotten better but theres not enough ACTION to go with it.On the bright side. I like Lex. He's cunning and sly and evil. Exactly what Lex should be.

This season was highly entertaining from start to finish, with darker, more adult themes than previous seasons.  I love the fact that Chloe was made a ""superfreak"" and the introduction of her mother, played by the fabulous Linda Carter was brilliant.  Despite her death at the end of Season Six, I don't really think she's dead... that would be too easy and there was nothing officially released regarding Allison Mack's departure.  BTW, is it too much to ask for Chloe to appear on the cover of one of these DVD box sets?  She may be the only made up character on the series (who was not in the actual Superman mythology before), but c'mon she's important to the series.  I enjoyed Chloe's relationship with Jimmy, as well as Lois' relationship with the Green Arrow.  As far as Clark and Lana, I hope the writers use the seventh (and I think final) season of the series (since Tom Welling, Michael Rosemnbaum, Allison Mack, and Kristin Kreuk are all contracted for seven) to finally wrap up this perpetually pointless romance.

The season premiere, the season finale, the wedding, and an episode here and there, were actually ok.  But to me it seems like when Smallville moved to The CW, the graphics weren't even close to last season's.  In this season, the focus was actually more on the supporting characters (Lex, Lana, Chloe, etc.) rather than Clark.  Which is fine, but I just think they should have given them better storylines than what they had.  And I know that The CW network had to have budget cuts, but even the shows they showed in high definition (Smallville, Gilmore Girls, etc.) just looked better last year on The WB than they do on The CW.  I brought that up because the graphics on Smallville just seemed to be used more towards the season premiere and finale and not the rest of the season.  I mean bottomline, this season was disappointing with some of the storylines and the development of the characters wasn't up to the level it should have been.  I mean if it was up to me, I would just download the episodes I enjoyed, and not buy the season 6 box set.  But if you are a die-hard Smallville/Superman fan, then this set is for you.

1054023,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000N6SE4U,Robert Moore,"[5, 12]","Warning!  Spoilers ahead!For a not-hard-to-locate reason, Season Six of SMALLVILLE was one of the more disappointing for many fans of the show.  What made it harder to take than other seasons?  The romance between Lex and Lana.  I personally remained a fan throughout the entire season, but the whole Lex and Lana possessed a huge ick factor.  Actually, so many things surrounding Lana were unpleasant this season.  It wasn't Kristin Kreuk's fault; she didn't write her storyline.  For instance, she spent most of the season ""pregnant"" but she never seemed to gain weight, even wearing a spectacularly svelte dress at her wedding.  And somehow Lana's being pregnant with another man's child, in particular Lex's child, doesn't seem to loom as an issue for Clark.  From first to last, the whole marriage to Lex thing had an air of unreality to it.Despite the Lex-Lana marriage, this was a fun season.  Roughly the first half involved the appearance of the show's first full-time superhero, Oliver Queen aka The Green Arrow.  Narratively, Oliver, who quickly discovered Clark's secret, talked with Clark about the need to use his powers for the betterment of the world.  Though in the second half of the season Clark did not pick up on the earlier suggestions, it was important in laying out possible future paths for Clark.  Oliver is deeply involved in researching and uncovering a secret laboratory project that Lex is involved with.  This turns out to be working with ""meteor freaks"" and alien DNA in order to produce super empowered soldiers.  This weaves its way in and out of the entire season.There are also a number of subplots during the season.  Chloe is working fulltime at the Daily Planet, where she is reunited with her old flame James Olsen (played by one half of the Ashmore twins).  Near the end of the season Chloe learns that she is herself a so-called ""meteor freak,"" though only in the finale do we learn what her ability is.  In the cliff-hanging ending, her ability appears to have led to her death, though more likely it is merely her ""death,"" just as Lois ""died"" in the finale, only to be rescued by Chloe's ability.  Another plot over the season is Lana's growing suspicions about Clark's abilities.  Eventually she devises a test that will allow her to see if Clark will come to Chloe's rescue.  When he does, she realizes what some if not what all of his powers are.  In the finale, he begins to tell her what his secret is, only to learn she already knows.  He explains to her what she doesn't know, that he is actually from another planet.  They kiss, but a few minutes later Lana ""dies"" in an explosion.  I've heard no Season Seven spoilers, but I can't imagine anyone actually believes that Lana has left the show.Season Six, as is usual with the show, introduced a few new pieces of the Superman final portrait.  Clark added a new power, freezing breath, and a new villain, a version of Bizarro Superman with Bizarro Clark.  The final shot of Season Six was a new copy of Clark having his face go all angular.  That is where Season Six will pick up.  Superpower-wise, I hope they finally give Clark the ability to fly.  I'm sure the hold up has been expense.  The super fast running has to be a lot cheaper than flying, but it really is the last major power to add to his repertoire.All in all I enjoyed this season.  The problem with SMALLVILLE has always been that it has always had a significant number of weak episodes to go along with the good ones.  Low points this season included an episode dealing with immigration issues, with a meteor rock twist, and a film noir episode that simply didn't work on any level.For a couple of years now I've been an advocate of ending the show SMALLVILLE and restarting it as METROPOLIS.  I continue to feel this way.  I think the show has come close to exhausting what can be done with the Smallville angle.  The show has pretty much set up all that needs to be done to make the transition to the grown up Clark.  The six-season long transformation of the Lex-Clark friendship into enemies is more or less complete.  The only thing left, really, is to find a need to move Clark permanently from Smallville to Metropolis and a way of removing Lana from the show as effectively as possible.  I love Kristin Kreuk and would miss her almost impossible good looks, but the brute fact is that Lois Lane and not Lana Lang is the future.

1054028,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B000N6SE4U,Sean Pasek,"[12, 14]","*Note: Anyone who has not seen the sixth season, I highly recommend NOT reading the back of the box.  If you want to be surprised, the synopsis on the back might ruin something for you.Most television series tend to be on their down-slope by the time the sixth season rolls around.  Writers usually have trouble coming up with new and inventive stories to keep the audience intrigued.  In fact, I can only think of a handful of shows that are either as good as when they started, or they are actually even better.  It doesn't happen often.  Trust me, after watching television series for over 30 years, I know.  Smallville's writers have succeeded in placing the series in the with the few and far between; the shows that have been able to continue going strong.The sixth season marks the time and point when Clark finally accepts his destiny.  He finally realizes that he must use his powers to help the people of not only Smallville and the friends he loves, but the world.  Granted he receives a little nudge in that direction from a new ally, but he finally realizes that his destiny far outreaches the boundaries of Smallville.  The challenges that Clark must now face are new, but no less painful and deadly as the challenges he has faced in previous seasons.Exactly how does one deal with the fact that the love of your life is now with your arch-nemesis?  At least the first half of the season focuses on how Clark deals with Lana being with Lex.  The Clark-Lex rivalry hits full throttle in this season.  We finally see that Lex isn't only manipulative, but he has now added unbridled cruelty to his list of unpleasant characteristics.  Lionel can still play the game, but he wasn't nearly as cruel or vindictive as Lex has become.  Just watch what happens when anyone threatens to take away something that Lex believes is his.  We really start to see a much clearer picture of the Lex Luthor who will ultimately be Superman's greatest enemy.Clark's new mission this season is to round up the ""ex-cons"" from the Phantom Zone.  He feels that he is responsible as well as feeling that he is the only one capable of stopping them from ravaging Earth.  Clark has a great sense of responsibility.  The writers must be careful not to add too much ""guilt"" ingredient to that, otherwise you're wandering into Spider-Man territory.  Superman's motivation has always been responsibility and a keen sense of justice.There are many questions that will be asked and answered during the course of this season:  What is Jor-El's true intentions for Clark?  What kind of a person was Jor-El?  What is Lionel Luthor's interest in Clark, and will he prove to be Clark's asset, or downfall?  And how does Clark deal with what potentially proves to be the loss of another loved one?For those of you who are familiar with DC Comics, a couple more heroes will be revealed, and several others will make another appearance.  Keep an eye out for the Green Arrow and one more famous hero who I will not mention here.  Flash (Impulse), Aquaman, and Cyborg return.  The episode that has them all working together is both fun and exciting.  It also opens the door for possibilities outside of the Smallville storyline.Tom Welling continues to shine as Clark Kent.  He has rounded out the character so well that he's the best actor to play the role of Clark Kent in television history.  He knows how to deliver a line or even a simple look.  I still feel that many people overlook him.  He also pulls off the naiveness of Clark perfectly.  This is very hard to do, but Tom makes it work.  It is a talent that many of the show's directors have stated that Tom has mastered, and that few actors can pull off.Michael Rosenbaum, who is the best Lex Luthor, is able to successfully transform Lex to such a degree, that he is able to keep the audience guessing.  For those who have grown with the series and remember Lex when he was a decent guy and a good friend of Clark's, we almost can't believe the things that he is now doing.  The writers ingeniously use this to keep the audience guessing.  Is Lex behind this?  Is it someone else?  Can he possibly be that deplorable?We've also seen Kristin blossom as an actress.  For now she must show us that by being with Lex, she has adopted certain Lex-like tendencies, whether she's aware of them or not.  Can Lana be just as manipulative as Lex?  How far will she go to the ""dark side?""  In many ways, the character of Lana Lang is a tragic one.  Don't believe me?  Think back to how she was in the first season, and then track where she is now.  Her character is as tragic as that of Lex Luthor.  She's a woman who really only desires one thing: to be loved, and to be loved by the one person that she loves.  Lana has lost almost everyone in her life that mattered to her.  It is not a great leap to consider that a person might become a bit desperate, and thus, run to the arms of the person who appears to shower you with love and affection.  And for Lana, that person is Lex.  But some interesting events will take place to really make Lana think about the decisions that she has made.One bright addition to the cast is that of Aaron Ashmore as Jimmy Olson.  We finally get introduced to the young, excitable character that Jimmy has always been depicted as in the films and comics.  He's also Chloe's love interest, but something is amiss for young Jimmy.  He's unable to figure out the relationship dynamic between Chloe and Clark.  Jimmy is not as endearing toward Clark at first.Justin Hartley is fantastic as Oliver Queen, aka Green Arrow.  He is young, athletic, and has an almost Batman-like detective prowess.  He's also a love interest for Lois.  But can it last?  And where does Green Arrow's history cross paths with Lex?As with all Smallville seasons, there is yet another cliff-hanger.  It will see the introduction of yet another classic Superman villain.  It will also leave the well-being of several Smallville characters in doubt. The main climax, however, finally comes down; a revelation between two characters that fans have been dying for ever since the very first episode aired.The writers of this show must be given their credit.  I think Jeph Loeb, especially is responsible for the tremendous success of the show.  As an executive producer and consultant from DC Comics, he knows what will work on the show, and what won't.  He also understands that many things that work in the comic book world don't necessarily translate over to television.  He is able to find the bridge between the two worlds.  Few people are able to do this.  I truly believe that he a big reason why Smallville has remained so successful and a top-quality show.It isn't hard to imagine why one of America's greatest heroes is fictional and yet has such a tremendous following spanning several generations.  Heck, there is even a town called Metropolis in Illinois dedicated to America's favorite hero.  For a while, Superman has badly needed a face-lift to make him appealing to new generations while keeping the core of the character intact.  Clark is now someone that people can relate to.  He endures many of the same problems that many people and young people face today.  Smallville has continued to make Superman timeless, for the power of good, justice, and decency are badly needed now more than ever before.  In short, the world needs a Superman, and I don't mean the fictional world.  I mean OUR world.As you finish watching season 6, think of Clark throughout the course of those six seasons.  Remember all of the pains, trials, and tribulations that he has gone through, and yet the core of the character remains intact.  He still tries to see the best in people and his unwavering faith in his friends (often when it is not returned) makes him stand apart from virtually any other person that we know, fictional or not.  Clark always has hope...hope for the world, hope for his friends, and even hope for his enemies.""Your greatest strength might also be your greatest weakness.  Hope.""--Martha Kent to her son.I must mention that this DVD has one flaw: no actor commentaries on any of the episodes.  It's a shame.  The commentaries are really good, and I was looking forward to listening to more of them during this season.",5,Smallville Continues to Fly As Clark Finally Accepts His Destiny,1190505600,"09 23,

1054029,A150G4BYT4ERH0,B000N6SE4U,"senior heroine ""athena""","[7, 17]","It's apparent that the producers want to keep Lana center stage even at the expense of the supposed starring super hero.  Smallville has turned into the Lana and Lex show.  The series took a wrong turn the year it prematurely killed off Jonathan Kent.  Next, they developed an inane relationship between Martha and Lionel under the approving eyes of Clark.  Not to mention -- how are Clark and Louis supposed to meet for the first time at the Daily Planet when they've already lived together in Smallville?  This was a terrific show for the first four years, but this last year isn't worth buying.  I don't see how the present writers, directors, producers can bring it back on course.

Arrow is everything Clark has not been; decisive, charismatic, and -gasp!- heroic. The special effects show CW can do a full superhero show on a tv budget, and the writers do well when they're not stretching characters over 6+ years. The arc culminates with all the previous guest heroes in a ""Justice League"" episode, which is quite entertaining.Also entertaining is this year's main storyline of Clark stopping Phantom Zone escapees. They lend a nice twist to the 'freak of the week' staple. Lex Luthor pushes his project of a super-powered army, and a glowing-eyed visitor played by Phil Morris helps Clark. Jimmy Olsen romances Chloe (don't think about the screwy timeline, Aaron Ashmore does a fine job), and a film noir episode shows Smallville's cinematography at its best.It's a shame so much is dragged down by the Lex/Lana relationship, which hits higher and higher peaks of absurdity as the season progresses. And the adult characters get seriously shortchanged this year - goodbye to Annette O'Toole, as this season is her last. How a show about responsiblity, values, and growing up can continue without both parental figures boggles the mind.The specs haven't been announced yet, but Smallville dvds in the past have offered 2-3 commentary tracks, loads of deleted scenes, and some featurettes. I hope they also include the 'Justice' online comic, which was a fun side story like the Chloe Chronicles.

1054032,AAULAGYRQMRQ,B000N6SE4U,S. Nemati,"[8, 23]","I love Smallville, but this season reached some new lows. The Lex and Lana triangle started off strong in season 5, with some well written tension between the characters. This season begins with Lana moving in with Lex: a drastic step considering how long it took her to settle down with Clark. Lana undergoes too many personality changes, going from angry, self confident, and downright manipulative to trapped, scared, and helpless in the course of her relationship with Lex. The character seriously needs some kind of consistency. Also, the 5th season hinted at a new and exciting romance with Chloe... why then did they decide to bring back the old and rotting Lana and Clark relationship again?Additionally the first half of the season was entirely taken over another superhero. Really? Are the writers so plumb out of ideas that they have to make another show? Green Arrow was a good character, but he was a bit over-used. The other new character is Jimmy Olsen. Jimmy is an affable, fun character, but never seemed close to Chloe's intellectual equal.The plot itself never seemed that fresh and interesting. Last year, we had a dastardly, manipulative alien who acted as Clark's teacher and mentor. This year we get more cookie cutter villains and a somewhat lame plot about aliens from another dimension. Lex's 33.1 plotline about collecting 'freaks' is only slightly more interesting, but strays further out into the bizarre... a bit too far for my taste.The few highlights included ""Zod"" (great season opener), ""Nemesis"" (finally highlighting Clark and Lex), ""Justice"" (fun comic book fare with many future superheroes), and ""Labyrinth"" (Clark's life is a lie). For me, these were the only really solid episodes.

1054041,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B000N6SE4U,Tom Benton,"[230, 275]","*Possible spoilers within.*""Smallville"" fans continue to perplex me.  It seems that the majority of ""Smallville"" fans consider what I and those with whom I watch the series have deemed the weakest seasons of the show to be the show's best years.  Similarly, while I found the show's sixth season to be its best sinceSeason One, most fans have ranked it among the series' worst.  I'm not putting down those who think differently from me, but I have thoroughly evaluated each season and I cannot imagine what these viewers are seeing that I am not.  There are those who are now dreading the next season and the season which may follow (creators Al Gough and Miles Millar have said that the show will run no longer than eight seasons).  After Season Six, however, I am eagerly awaiting more of a show that has, after years of stumbling through piles and piles of mediocrity, finally reached its potential.InSeason Five, Clark Kent found himself without his most beloved ""guiding light"" when his father died.  The feelings of loneliness grew as his relationship with Lex Luthor crumbled, rebuilt as a bitter rivalry, and Clark was forced to push the love of his life, Lana Lang, away.  To make matters worse, Lana took refuge in Lex's open arms.  By the end of the season, Clark had learned to deal with his grief and had a better sense of who he was, but he still had a long way to go before becoming the Man of Steel.  In Season Six, Clark's destiny grows a lot nearer.  Season Six revolves around Clark's discovery of who he is through two major storylines: 1) the tormented relationship between he and Lana Lang (which should have ended seasons ago and has now reached the point of absurdity), as well as Lana's potentially strong affections for Lex, and 2) Lex Luthor's rapid loss of morality and Clark's realization that he alone can stop him.  There is a third major storyline as well, dealing with a number of alien ghosts which escape from the Phantom Zone in the season premiere; Clark must round them up before they wreak too much havoc.There are a number of subplots too.  The largest and most popular involves Oliver Queen, played by Justin Hartley, who was cast in the title role of ""Smallville""'s failed spinoff ""Aquaman.""  Queen is a young, attractive businessman who arrives in Metropolis with a dark secret: he is the Green Arrow (one of DC's most popular heroes), a hooded rogue who protects those who need protection.  He is also a sort of Robin Hood - which is bad news for Clark, whose mother is now a full-fledged, popular politician.  Queen also has a checkered past with Lex Luthor, which makes for one of the season's more interesting subplots.  Others include Chloe's relationship with spunky young photographer Jimmy Olsen (played by Aaron Ashmore, whom I personally find extremely irking) and Lois Lane's beginnings in journalism.I had a number of complaints about Season Five, and even a few seasons before that.  The writing was foolish and predictable and the dialog was just trash.  The acting was lackluster.  The directing was virtually non-existent.  The music was frankly turgid.  The sixth season, however, corrects all of that.  The writing is, for the most part, excellent.  The season's story arcs were intricate and interesting, and more importantly, each individual episode was a blast, well-written and suspenseful.  Thankfully, the writers finally focused a lot less on meteor freaks (in fact, they hardly crop up at all!) and a lot more on other foes, in this case the ""Zoners"" (those who have escaped from the Phantom Zone).  The dialog picked up a lot as well, and felt a whole more natural and realistic than it did in previous seasons.The acting improved as well.  Tom Welling's Clark seemed rather oafish in the previous season, but in this season, he is Clark Kent once more: strong, brave, and noble.  John Glover is as delectable as ever, and Michael Rosenbaum gets a much-deserved dose of unflinching evil.  Erica Durance begins to show promise as Clark's future love - for example, ""Crimson,"" a fan favorite episode in which Clark is exposed to red kryptonite after a kiss from Lois, who herself has been drugged with a love potion.  Allison Mack is especially fun, and the writers have mercifully saved us from most of her godawful one-liners.  Even Kristen Kreuk, whose character I couldn't stand in previous seasons, improves slightly.The show picks up some wonderful style from its directors, something it was completely devoid of in SeasonsFourand Five.  A great example of this is ""Wither,"" which features some stunning visuals.  I don't know what happened to Mark Snow, but his music went from cringeworthy and stale to downright fantastic.  His score is hip, creative, cool, and grandiose, exactly what it should be.  I really enjoyed hearing the music in each episode - even when Snow's theme for the Green Arrow is a painfully obvious rehash of Danny Elfman's theme for Tim Burton's""Batman""movies.As far as the episodes go, this season holds a variety of standouts.  The season premiere, ""Zod,"" is great.  It's not as epic as the fifth season premiere, but it's very cool anyway.  Though I still find the producers' failure to cast an actor as Zod downright despicable, Rosenbaum plays his possession of Lex very well.  Hearing Rosenbaum deliver""Superman II""'s classic ""Kneel before Zod!"" is really a delight, and the splitting resemblance between the disembodied Zod and Terence Stamp in ""Superman II"" is sure to please fans of the films.  ""Sneeze"" introduces a new power for Clark: super breath.  ""Justice"" is a very fun episode and has been called the best episode of the series by many.  I don't agree in that aspect, but it is very neat to see all the show's past superheroes gathered together.  The inevitable ""It's All In Your Head"" episode comes in the form of ""Labyrinth,"" surprisingly a very enjoyable episode (in a twisted sort of way).  ""Freak"" puts forth the revelation that Chloe herself has some sort of meteor power and has become a meteor freak after being exposed to so much kryptonite.  That's an interesting and tense episode.  ""Promise"" is a painful, dramatic episode, but its successor, the super-violent ""Fight Club""-inspired ""Combat,"" is a real blast.  It's probably one of the show's weaker episodes, but it's also one of its most fun.  Personally, I loved it: seeing Clark dress up in leather and kick the s--- out a jacked-up wrestler, seeing Lois in tight red leather - grand fun to be sure.""Nemesis"" is one of the series' strongest episodes, in which Clark and Lex are trapped in an underground tunnel and forced to deal with their issues which each other.  Kudos to the writers for thinking this one up.  The dramatic confrontation between Welling and Rosenbaum, Clark and Lex, good and evil, is just superb.  ""Noir,"" unfortunately, is not.  What seemed like a brilliant idea - play the show as though it were a film noir in the 1940s - is interesting, but little more than that, and the final product falls flat on its face.  As always, the season goes out with a bang, a lot of them, with ""Phantom,"" which leaves one character on his way to jail, three characters possibly dead, one superpower revealed, and introduces a character I have long awaited but thought I would never seen on ""Smallville.""  It also featured a much-advertised ""death"" of a major character.  I would like little more than to see that character actually be killed, but the fact that she's not is ridiculously clear.At its finish, the sixth season of ""Smallville"" is a wonderful surprise.  It's quite possibly the best season since the show's outstanding first, and it's the first season to truly reach its potential since the series' early years.  I have no idea what happened between the end of Season Five and the premiere of Season Six, but everything that was so wrong with the show was drastically improved.  Season Six is quality, comic-bookish, fun television, and although the second half of the season is rather lopsided (""Progeny,"" which features a guest appearance by Lynda Carter, is arguably the most dull episode of the entire show), it's a spectacular season.  Clark has yet to fly, and the show hadn't really flown since the beginning ofSeason Three, but with Season Six ""Smallville"" soars as it, like its young hero, seemed destined to from the start.",5,The series finally reaches its potential - an excellent season,1180396800,"05 29, 2007",2007,8335,"['*Possible', 'spoilers', '*', 'Smallville', 'fans', 'continue', 'perplex', 'majority',

This is the first season if not only season where Clark doesn't have at least one love interest in the whole season.  His feelings for Lana are still there of course, but he is more focused on 2 things.  Stopping his former friend Lex Luthor's Meteor Infected 33.1 experiments and re capturing and or destroying freed prisoners from the Phantom Zone.  I'm assuming that everyone has seen Season Five and therefore no need in describing what the Phantom Zone is or what happened to Lex.  The key story points of this season are Lex and Lana's relationship and the destruction of that relationship.  Clark's road again to be the adult Superman, Chloe finding out she is meteor infected, Lois' journey to the newspaper field, and Clark and Lex's friendship for all purposes being over.  The stand out thing from season six for me is Lex Luthor's journey into becoming the evil bastard we all know and love to despise.  Michael Rosenbuam's performance of Lex Luthor is right up there with Kevin Spacey in Superman Returns and John Shea in Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman as my favorite interruptions of the character.  Michael captures Lex's glib sense that he truly feels he is not doing anything evil.  Also this season continues Lex's streak of loss of women in his life.  He lost his mother in his early teens, he was betrayed and lost Dr. Helen Bryce (Emmanuelle Vaugier) his first wife in Smallville Season Three, and now he has lost Lana Lang his second wife. Which furthers Lex's hunger for power and control.  The video transfer and audio transfer on these Discs are pitch perfect and the special features are not horrible but it should be noted, this is the first season of Smallville not to have any audio commentaries on any episodes.

1054044,AP3B615GM191G,B000N6SE4U,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","The preceding (fifth) season of Smallville accomplished two main tasks: setting up the Lex/Lana relationship and moving the show in a more action & sci-fi direction.  One plotline succeeded, the other failed.  Let's start with what went right in Smallville's Sixth Season, then end with why it became downright difficult to watch at some times:-As Clark pursues escaped Kryptonian prisoners (a key season-long arc), his action-packed battles with the villians are sights to behold.-The formation of the ""junior"" Justice League, bringing back favorites from seasons past and introducing a new hero who proved to be a ""bullseye"".-A completely new aspect of Chloe Sullivan's character is revealed towards the end of the season.-More ""wink-wink"" nods to the Superman cannon, including a certain bow-tie clad camera man and an episode that precludes a potential Clark/Lois relationship.-The continued descent of Lex into pure evil, whether through flashbacks to his youth or his ""33.1"" secret projects.-As usually, the season premiere and finale are both visually and creatively stunning.  Much like the end of season five, the final scene will have you anxiously awaiting the Season Seven DVD's to be released.However, despite those positive factors, the Sixth Season is severely lacking in some key areas:-First, the Clark/Lana relationship is streched beyond the realm of good writing, where its ""on-again, off-again"" nature is apparent in nearly every episode.  One week they may be together, while the next week they won't even speak to each other.  This writing faux pas also hindered what could have been a dynamite Lex/Lana relationship.  Even when genuine Clark/Lana moments are attempted towards the end of the season, they lack any emotional punch, as that relationship has been used again and again.-Another problem with this season (as with the previous two) is the character of Lois Lane.  If there ever was any doubt that Lois is on the show for her sex appeal only, this season put those doubts to rest.  Whereas Lois should be used to hint at her ultimate relationship with Clark, so is all too often just ""eye candy"".-Finally, the writers/producers spend way too much time on the concept of Clark's negative impact on the world (what I like to call ""Clark whining"").  Multiple times this season Clark is seen lamenting the very fact that he was ever sent to Earth...not a ""Superman-esque"" attitude whatsoever.  I appreciated that a young Clark may grapple with those issues, but it seemed to be a much over-used dramatic technique.To conclude, the Sixth Season of Smallville did not measure up to its past.  Though doing a decent job of advancing the Superman ""mythology"", this season emotionally bankrupted most of the show's important relationships, thus providing little to no ""tearjerker"" moments that had been such a part of earlier seasons.",3,"Too Soapy, Too Whiny",1211760000,"05 26, 2008",2008,2859,"['preceding', 'fifth', 'season', 'Smallville', 'accomplished', 'two', 'main', 'tasks', 'setting', 'up', 'Lex/Lana', 'relationship', 'moving', 'show', 'more', 'action', 'sci-fi', 'direction', 'One', 'plotline', 'succeeded', 'other', 'failed', 'Let', 'start', 'what', 'went', 'right', 'Smallville', 'Sixth', 'Season', 'then', 'end', 'why', 'became', 'downright', 'difficult', 'watch', 'times', '-As', 'Clark', 'escaped', 'Kryptonian', 'prisoners', 'key', 'season-long', 'arc', 'action-packed', 'battles', 'villians', 'are', 'sights', 'behold.-The', 'formation', 'junior', 'Justice', 'League', 'bringing', 'back', 'favorites', 'seasons', 'past', 'introducing', 'new', 'hero', 'who', 'proved', 'be', 'bullseye', '.-A', 'completely', 'new', 'aspect', 'Chloe', 'Sullivan', 'character', 'revealed', 'end', 'season.-More', 'wink-wink', 'nods', 'Superman', 'cannon', 'including', 'certain', 'bow-tie', 'clad', 'camera', 'man', 'episode', 'potential', 'Clark/Lois', 'relationship.-The', 'continued', 'descent', 'Lex', 'pure', 'evil', 'flashbacks', 'youth', '33.1', 'secret', 'projects.-As', 'usually', 'season', 'premiere', 'finale', 'are', 'visually', 'creatively', 'stunning', 'Much', 'end', 'season', 'five', 'final', 'scene', 'will', 'have', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'Season', 'Seven', 'DVD', 'be', 'released.However', 'positive', 'factors', 'Sixth', 'Season', 'severely', 'lacking', 'key', 'areas', '-First', 'Clark/Lana', 'relationship', 'streched', 'realm', 'good', 'writing', 'where', 'on-again', 'off-again', 'nature', 'apparent', 'nearly', 'episode', 'One', 'week', 'may', 'be', 'together', 'next', 'week', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'speak', 'other', 'writing', 'faux', 'pas', 'also', 'hindered', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'dynamite', 'Lex/Lana', 'relationship', 'Even', 'when', 'genuine', 'Clark/Lana', 'moments', 'are', 'attempted', 'end', 'season', 'lack', 'emotional', 'punch', 'relationship', 'been', 'used', 'again', 'again.-Another', 'problem', 'season', 'previous', 'two', 'character', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'ever', 'was', 'doubt', 'Lois', 'show', 'sex', 'appeal', 'only', 'season', 'put', 'doubts', 'rest', 'Whereas', 'Lois', 'should', 'be', 'used', 'hint', 'ultimate', 'relationship', 'Clark', 'so', 'too', 'often', 'just', 'eye', 'candy', '.-Finally', 'writers/producers', 'spend', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'concept', 'Clark', 'negative', 'impact', 'world', 'what', 'like', 'call', 'Clark', 'whining', 'Multiple', 'times', 'season', 'Clark', 'seen', 'lamenting', 'very', 'fact', 'was', 'ever', 'sent', 'Earth', 'not', 'Superman-esque', 'attitude', 'whatsoever', 'appreciated', 'young', 'Clark', 'may', 'grapple', 'issues', 'seemed', 'be', 'much', 'over-used', 'dramatic', 'technique.To', 'conclude', 'Sixth', 'Season', 'Smallville', 'did', 'not', 'measure', 'up', 'past', 'doing', 'decent', 'job', 'advancing', 'Superman', 'mythology', 'season', 'emotionally', 'bankrupted', 'most', 'show', 'important', 'relationships', 'thus', 'providing', 'little', 'tearjerker', 'moments', 'had', 'been', 'part', 'earlier', 'seasons']",Smallville: Season 6
