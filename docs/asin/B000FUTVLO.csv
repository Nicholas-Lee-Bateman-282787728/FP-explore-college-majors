996374,A2WIMO3QLKXACI,B000FUTVLO,"A. Wright ""yetums""","[17, 27]",The first two seasons of nip/tuck were awesome but season three took things in a terrible direction. The writers changed the charecters and slapped us in the face with the outcome of this carver deal. The show used to be upbeat and still had a playfull tone even though there were some major issues. I would still find myself laughing or smiling about something every episode. But every episode in season three was so depressing and dreary that it was tough to make it through to the end.The character changes through me off big time. example: Dr Troy's hair was tore up the entire season. I know its kinda nitpicky but he was a player and he seemed like more of a loser. Dr McNamara and taking in the witness protection family was plain dumb.The kicker for me was when you find out the secret of Quentin. It seemed as if the writers ran out of ways to shock their viewers so they came up with something very stupid. I was shocked but at the writers for being brain dead.sorry bout the rant but I felt cheated as I watched season three.Makes me not care about season four.,2,where did my show go?,1155427200,"08 13, 2006",2006,1072,"['first', 'two', 'seasons', 'nip/tuck', 'were', 'awesome', 'season', 'three', 'took', 'things', 'terrible', 'direction', 'writers', 'changed', 'charecters', 'slapped', 'face', 'outcome', 'carver', 'deal', 'show', 'used', 'be', 'upbeat', 'still', 'had', 'playfull', 'tone', 'even', 'were', 'major', 'issues', 'would', 'still', 'find', 'laughing', 'smiling', 'something', 'episode', 'episode', 'season', 'three', 'was', 'so', 'depressing', 'dreary', 'was', 'tough', 'make', 'end.The', 'character', 'changes', 'off', 'big', 'time', 'example', 'Dr', 'Troy', 'hair', 'was', 'tore', 'up', 'entire', 'season', 'know', 'kinda', 'nitpicky', 'was', 'player', 'seemed', 'more', 'loser', 'Dr', 'McNamara', 'taking', 'witness', 'protection', 'family', 'was', 'plain', 'dumb.The', 'kicker', 'was', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'secret', 'Quentin', 'seemed', 'writers', 'ran', 'ways', 'shock', 'viewers', 'came', 'up', 'something', 'very', 'stupid', 'was', 'shocked', 'writers', 'being', 'brain', 'dead.sorry', 'rant', 'felt', 'cheated', 'watched', 'season', 'three.Makes', 'not', 'care', 'season', 'four']",Nip/Tuck: Season 3

996376,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B000FUTVLO,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[0, 3]","As much as season 3 of `Nip/Tuck' really slipped as far as delivering the goods, it still serves up better entertainment than most television series today.  It's still just as addicting, it's just not as rewarding in the end.  I will say though that the season finally was a doozy and made up for some of the sub-par episodes throughout the season.  So, Matt (John Hensley) goes through a rebellious Neo-Nazi stage as he mourns the loss of his girlfriend, and once he finds out that she was really a `he' he goes even more berserk.  He takes up with a crazy white supremacist (Brittney Snow), beats up a transsexual and turns to hating his family.  Sean (Dylan Walsh) and Christian (Julian McMahon) are still trying to work out their relationship after the discovery that Matt is indeed Christians son, and then add to the mix Quentin Costa (Bruno Campos) the new bi-sexual plastic surgeon they hired on to take some time off of Sean's hands.  The soap opera begins as Quentin propositions Christian then starts dating Julia (Joely Richardson) who has just opened a business with Christians ex Gina (Jessalyn Gilsig) and Liz (Rhoma Maffia).  Oh yeah, and there's the mess with that pesky Carver who hasn't stopped making a mess of the faces of America.  So Christian takes up with the cop investigating the case (Rhona Mitra) as well as getting engaged to Kimber (Kelly Carlson) and then getting accused of the murders himself.  Oh yeah and then there's the woman in the Witness Protection Program (Anne Heche) who takes up with Sean.  So with all this going on it becomes a bit difficult to stay on board.  The Carver story goes a bit extreme, the soap opera turns a bit exhausting and the relationships between the main characters gets a bit unrealistic (not to mention the off the wall surgeries) but all that included I'm still addicted, I'm still watching and that's why I give this four stars...because it wouldn't be `Nip/Tuck' unless it were extreme...that's what we love about it!",4,With a little nipping and some tucking it could have been perfect...,1160611200,"10 12, 2006",2006,1989,"['As', 'much', 'season', '3', 'Nip/Tuck', 'really', 'slipped', 'as', 'far', 'delivering', 'goods', 'still', 'up', 'better', 'entertainment', 'most', 'television', 'series', 'today', 'still', 'just', 'addicting', 'just', 'not', 'rewarding', 'end', 'will', 'say', 'season', 'finally', 'was', 'doozy', 'made', 'up', 'sub-par', 'episodes', 'season', 'So', 'Matt', 'John', 'Hensley', 'rebellious', 'Neo-Nazi', 'stage', 'loss', 'girlfriend', 'once', 'out', 'was', 'really', 'even', 'more', 'berserk', 'up', 'crazy', 'white', 'supremacist', 'Brittney', 'Snow', 'up', 'transsexual', 'hating', 'family', 'Sean', 'Dylan', 'Walsh', 'Christian', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'are', 'still', 'trying', 'work', 'out', 'relationship', 'discovery', 'Matt', 'indeed', 'Christians', 'son', 'then', 'add', 'mix', 'Quentin', 'Costa', 'Bruno', 'Campos', 'new', 'bi-sexual', 'plastic', 'surgeon', 'hired', 'take', 'time', 'Sean', 'hands', 'soap', 'opera', 'Quentin', 'propositions', 'Christian', 'then', 'dating', 'Julia', 'Joely', 'Richardson', 'who', 'just', 'opened', 'business', 'Christians', 'ex', 'Gina', 'Jessalyn', 'Gilsig', 'Liz', 'Rhoma', 'Maffia', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'mess', 'pesky', 'Carver', 'who', ""n't"", 'stopped', 'making', 'mess', 'America', 'So', 'Christian', 'up', 'cop', 'investigating', 'case', 'Rhona', 'Mitra', 'as', 'well', 'getting', 'engaged', 'Kimber', 'Kelly', 'Carlson', 'then', 'getting', 'accused', 'murders', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'then', 'woman', 'Witness', 'Protection', 'Program', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'who', 'up', 'Sean', 'So', 'going', 'bit', 'difficult', 'stay', 'board', 'Carver', 'story', 'bit', 'extreme', 'soap', 'opera', 'bit', 'exhausting', 'relationships', 'main', 'characters', 'bit', 'unrealistic', 'not', 'mention', 'off', 'wall', 'surgeries', 'included', ""'m"", 'still', 'addicted', ""'m"", 'still', 'watching', 'why', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'Nip/Tuck', 'were', 'extreme', 'what', 'love']",Nip/Tuck: Season 3

This is a show with everything from sex, to murder, love, hate, yet it is one of the best performed and exciting show on TV. If U have not seen it, YOU MUST! The 3rd season, so far has most of the horror U can ever imagine. One Dr. is a handsome devil, single and many hot woman for him. The other partner is a family man, but they cannot seem to make it work. They both have done their share of screwing up the marriage. Now their oldest son is getting married. Wait until you see who it is.  There is a man going around carving up the faces of all the beautiful people. That is in season 3. And since almost everyone, at least most of the main characters are so beautiful, they are all getting carved up. The carver is obviously a very sick man So he slices and dices and ruins any beautiful faces. But there are our heroes. They fix them all up, and you would never see it ever happened. Yes, practically impossible, but it is TV. And boy, does it make for a show that is so worth while to see. But that is only a small amount of work our loving Doctors do. Nothing stops Mcnamara and Troy, world renowned plastic surgeons from helping all the carvers vicims. Even when they are carved themselves. This will be one of the most suspenseful shows in season 3 that you will ever see. Don't even try to figure it out You will not. But when U do, WOW will you be surprised. Of course there are many other scenes in this season, that will also keep you begging for more. Watch all three seasons. That way you will get to know the main characters, so when you see the things they do, you too will understand.It is an amzing show.

The ongoing storyline of The Carver continues with Christian even being suspected of being the Carver at one point during the season. The obese lady on the couch made headlines for Nip/Tuck due to it's ripped from the headlines nature but there were other ripped from the headlines procedures explored during the shows third season.

I'm not going to spoil all the hard to believe scenarios, but try watching this in a nonstop week of fun loving surgery, and see how crazy this season is!  That's what my wife and I did last week!  Wow!  What a freakfest!  I think that son has been to Hell and back.  It's weird, because when I watched the first season, I remember thinking:  whoa I hope my son is this mature as a high-school student.Of course, when you find out your older girlfriend has a little something extra, that would have a tendency to freak a high-school kid out.  But I'm not so sure I agree with the adult subjects that they expose this high-school kid to.  Who really believes he would be in a 21 or older bar, buying drinks without being asked for ID?  Come on.  And why does he suddenly want to explore the Transsexual world, when he was shocked by what he found out? Wouldn't that make you run away?  What's up with that?I noticed a definite drop in sex during this season; especially between Christian and various sex buddies.  I know he was with Kimber for most of that time.  I hope this doesn't become a regular thing, as I love those spicy scenes.  In fact, I saw a lot more blood and gruesomeness, and a lot less fun stuff.  Ohh, well.The whole ""Carver"" plotline was interesting, but why did it have to be a major character.  I was hoping for the ""Scooby Doo"" ending, where the police officer would pull off the mask, and it would be Barney, the nighttime janitor.  And he'd say something like:  ""and I woulda gotten away with it too, if it wasn't for you pesky kids, snooping around,"" or words to that effect.  That would have been SO AWESOME!!!But seriously, I think the show is very interesting, but the craziness of the plotlines can get a little bit too ""envelope bendish.""  If you get my drift.I give this 4 stars for originality and craziness. I drop it one star for actually titling one of the special features, ""Chasing the Carver"" as if the ""criminal plotline"" was something to feature over the Cosmetic aspects of the show.  Come on!

996384,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B000FUTVLO,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[5, 6]","FX Networks have been putting out consistently the best TV on TV for the past few years now. THE SHIELD, RESCUE ME, and NIP/TUCK are the best examples of edgy, adult-oriented drama on TV. Despite the fact that this season was a little on the scatter-shot side as far as its multi-layered plots were concerned, it still maintained the highest level of writing, directing, and above all, performance. Dylan Walsh, Joely Richardson, Kelly Carlson, John Helsney, Vanessa Redgrave and Rhona Mitra are all about as spot-on as you can get in their roles. Still towering above them all however, because of the sheer awesomeness of the role and the actor, is Julian McMahon as Dr. Christian Troy. His performances over the past three seasons have been pitch-perfect. His hedonistic highs and his hellish lows are just amazingly portrayed. It's very difficult to pull a role like this off, someone who has so many layers of self, and McMahon does it with ease.Now this season, as I said, is a little sporadic, and the ultimate storyline's payoff is a little on the weaker side, the rest of it glides forth majestically. The main plot involves the hunt for The Carver, someone who, in believing that ""Beauty is a curse on the world"", hideously disfigures and brutally assaults the beautiful people of Miami, and especially has their sights on Dr. Sean McNamara and Dr. Christian Troy, the two premier plastic surgeons of Miami. Who is The Carver? What is their true intent? Who will be the next victim? These are just portions of the third season. We have Matt, the son of Sean, Julia and Christian who is currently in the midst of a personal and sexual identity crisis after learning that his last love was actually a post-op transsexual. We also have Christian and Kimber heading to the altar! Julia is... pregnant? Julia's mother is in a firey explosion?Some of this sounds like bad soap opera, but the acting and writing far transcend that of the usual soap, and the addictive nature of the show keeps us coming back for much much more!",5,Still the show to beat!,1150761600,"06 20, 2006",2006,2029,"['FX', 'Networks', 'have', 'been', 'putting', 'out', 'consistently', 'best', 'TV', 'TV', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'now', 'SHIELD', 'RESCUE', 'ME', 'NIP/TUCK', 'are', 'best', 'examples', 'edgy', 'adult-oriented', 'drama', 'TV', 'fact', 'season', 'was', 'little', 'scatter-shot', 'side', 'as', 'far', 'multi-layered', 'plots', 'were', 'concerned', 'still', 'maintained', 'highest', 'level', 'writing', 'directing', 'performance', 'Dylan', 'Walsh', 'Joely', 'Richardson', 'Kelly', 'Carlson', 'John', 'Helsney', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'Rhona', 'Mitra', 'are', 'as', 'spot-on', 'can', 'get', 'roles', 'Still', 'towering', 'however', 'sheer', 'awesomeness', 'role', 'actor', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'Dr.', 'Christian', 'Troy', 'performances', 'past', 'three', 'seasons', 'have', 'been', 'pitch-perfect', 'hedonistic', 'highs', 'hellish', 'lows', 'are', 'just', 'amazingly', 'portrayed', 'very', 'difficult', 'pull', 'role', 'off', 'someone', 'who', 'so', 'many', 'layers', 'self', 'McMahon', 'ease.Now', 'season', 'said', 'little', 'sporadic', 'ultimate', 'storyline', 'payoff', 'little', 'weaker', 'side', 'rest', 'forth', 'majestically', 'main', 'plot', 'hunt', 'Carver', 'someone', 'who', 'believing', 'Beauty', 'curse', 'world', 'hideously', 'disfigures', 'brutally', 'assaults', 'beautiful', 'people', 'Miami', 'especially', 'sights', 'Dr.', 'Sean', 'McNamara', 'Dr.', 'Christian', 'Troy', 'two', 'premier', 'plastic', 'surgeons', 'Miami', 'Who', 'Carver', 'What', 'true', 'intent', 'Who', 'will', 'be', 'next', 'victim', 'are', 'just', 'portions', 'third', 'season', 'have', 'Matt', 'son', 'Sean', 'Julia', 'Christian', 'who', 'currently', 'midst', 'personal', 'sexual', 'identity', 'crisis', 'learning', 'last', 'love', 'was', 'actually', 'post-op', 'transsexual', 'also', 'have', 'Christian', 'Kimber', 'heading', 'altar', 'Julia', 'pregnant', 'Julia', 'mother', 'firey', 'explosion', 'bad', 'soap', 'opera', 'acting', 'writing', 'far', 'transcend', 'usual', 'soap', 'addictive', 'nature', 'show', 'coming', 'back', 'much', 'much', 'more']",Nip/Tuck: Season 3

It almost even convinces you that Christian was killed by the carver and it turns out that it's just a dream he tells Sean about. While Matt becomes more of a problem especially after he's told that Ava (Famke Janssen) used to be a man. So he sets out to find her or someone like her. Instead he gets mad and beats up a tranny when he sees that he/she has male parts. Matt later on gets chased down by he/shes that beat him up and pee on him.Also Christian hires a new partner named Quentin while Christian thinks about his future as a plastic surgeon. Neither of them like him much and it doesn't help things when he trys to get with both of them on seperate occasions. Also of course it doesn't make Sean feel any better for him when he starts showing an interest in Julia.Julia opens up a beauty spa and doesn't get the support from her mother that she wishes she'd get. Which leads to an excellent episode where Julia thinks her mom might've been on a plane that crashed. That's probably the most gripping episode next to the season finale. Things also get serious between Christian and Kimber and the season offers a lot of brilliant moments between the two.The show can have it's gross-out moments since they are plastic surgeons but if you get into the story and the characters, the show is hard to resist. The season finale is just brilliant and has two edge of your seat moments actually occuring at the same time, now that's good tv! It also manages to make you feel for Matt after making him easy to dislike earlier in the season. He gets stuck in a very bad situation with a girl's father who has to be the most hateful guy on the planet. While Christian and Sean also are in a life threatening situation after it's reveiled who the carver is.

996387,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000FUTVLO,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[81, 93]","I realize that by saying anything negative, I will alienate fans of the show.  TV fans are a notoriously fickle bunch.  I defy you--go to any other TV show DVD listing on Amazon.  Pick one that you think is terrible and the fan reviews there will be 5 star!  I think you can be a fan, but still be objective.  There are lots of shows that I have loved for various reasons--but that doesn't always make them good shows.  It means that I have overlooked their flaws.Now let's talk realistically about ""NIp/Tuck"".  I have seen every episode and continue to watch Season 4.  FX created a whole roster of ""adult"" programs designed to provoke the viewers--to ""push the envelope"".  Trust me, I respect that and I watch them all.  ""Nip/Tuck"" started out a bit erratically--the first season, for me, was about 3 1/2 stars.  I saw the promise, yet the episodes lacked a certain cohesion and the characters didn't seem fully flushed out yet.  Season 2, however, really hit the stride.  It became a gloriously over-the-top soap opera that was good, nasty fun!  I LOVED it, especially the deliriously campy Famke Janssen storyline.  Still didn't make it a ""great"" TV show, but it made for ""great"" TV.  I'd have given it 5 stars on entertainment value.Then there's Season 3.  People who object to this season often site the ""Carver"" storyline as being problematic.  I couldn't care less, the ""Carver"" plot was just as valid as any other (killing mobsters and feeding them to alligators from Season 1, anyone?).  The problem for me was a lot more serious.The show began to sell out it's core characters.  Now I have never been a big fan of the McNamara clan.  Strangely enough, they are the least compelling part of this show.  But I accepted the characters-- and as long as they made sense and the writers understood who they were--then I was fine.  The problem with Season 3 was that they no longer made sense.  The plots and outrageousness came first!  The writers made up the situations that ""pushed the envelope"" and then just plugged the characters into those scenarios however conveniently.  So we had characters doing or believing things every week that were not consistent with the ""people"" that we knew.  And if they needed to flip flop back for another storyline, that's what they did.  Don't ask me to care about your characters if you don't!  (Another FX show, the sometimes brilliant ""Rescue Me"" went through the same crisis).I wish ""Nip/Tuck"" well, it seems to be starting season 4 in good, fun shape.  No matter what, Christian will remain one hell of a great TV character.

996389,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000FUTVLO,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[23, 25]","""Nip/Tuck"" is a seriously f****d up television show.  I thought ""Six Feet Under"" was pushing the limits and ""Oz"" always liked to pour it on, but even if you put those two shows together they are not as f****d up as ""Nip/Tuck.""  There is no other word for it, especially since the producers of this show revel in the fact.  I mean, we thought the Carver was pretty bad (""Momma Boone""), and that whole story gets worse (""Rhea Reynolds) and then finds two levels beyond that (""Cherry Peck,"" ""Quentin Costa"").  Mercifully that whole subplot comes to an end, although in a whole bunch of ways that we never would have expected.  But given some of the other people we meet in Season 3, the Carver ends up being one of the saner people in South Florida.  There is ""Momma Boone,"" the obese woman who has to be surgically separated from the couch she has been sitting on for three years.  What about the mortuary employee who created a woman, ""Frankenlaura,"" from the body parts of other women?  Or ""Ben White,"" who suffers from Body Integrity Identity Disorder and wants his perfectly healthy leg amputated?I have only recently gotten up to speed with ""Nip/Tuck,"" because I was not especially interested in watching a television show dealing with plastic surgery.  Not because I am opposed to the ludicrous extremes to which (primarily) women go in this country to attain an idealized notion of beauty, but because I do not like to watch surgery being performed.  Specifically I do not like the cutting part.  In high school they showed us a film in health class to dissuade us from smoking.  It was not when they took out the cancerous lung that bothered me, but when they took the scalpel, made the initial incision, and then cracked the guy's chest with a rib spreader.  ""Nip/Tuck"" likes to show as much as they can get away with, and even if it is fake, it takes a while to get used to.  But apparently I am completely desensitized because there are dozens of victims of an airplane crash (""Sal Perri""), a face transplant (""Hannah Tedesco""), and a seventeen-year-old fetus (I will let you be surprised as to what episode has that surprising turn of events).If you think the plotlines are f****d up, then you should see the characters.  It used to be that I was pretty sure Christian Troy (Julian McMahon) was at the top of that list, but he might be the sanest of the principals given everything that happens in the third season, even though he tries to get married and finally meets his birth mother.  Of course, it is hard for Christian to take comfort in his life when dating the likes of Kit McGraw (Rhona Mitra) and Abby Mays (Rebecca Metz), makes Kimber (Kelly Carlson) look good.  Sean McNamara (Dylan Walsh) has a relatively easy year once he gets past Nicole Morretti (Anne Heche) and the fact that his new partner, Quentin Costa (Bruno Campos) is dating Julia (Joely Richardson).  But then Julia's entire year is pretty much a case of it being the best of times and the worst of times.  She opens up a successful business (""Joan Rivers"") and her marriage ends, but certainly the year is exemplified by what happens to her when she learns the plane her mother (Vanessa Redgrave) is on crashed on takeoff (""Sal Perri"").  Talk about having your best moment and your worst moment in the same episode.Even though he is not in all of the episodes, Matt McNamara (John Henlsey), wins the award for having the worst year.  His world is rocked when he visits Ava's house, finds Adrian's body, and then learns the truth about Ava from Sean (""Kiki"").  If you thought Matt's relationship with Cherry Peck (William Belli) took him to the dark side, wait until he becomes involved with Ariel Alderman (Brittany Snow) and her father (Brian Kerwin).  Then I remembered that he has Julia, Sean and Christian for parents, not to mention Ava as a therapist, and there is really no reason for us to think life will be much better for poor Matty.  I can also justify my choice because when we get to the big finale in the season with the Carver plotline it is juxtaposed with the final act of the strange and twisted little journey Matt took during this season.The obvious question at this point would be why do I watch ""Nip/Tuck""?  A large part of it is because it is so over the top.  You would think that at some point they would run out of ways to keep piling things on, but that certainly did not happen in the third season.  But beyond that what I find compelling is how despite wallowing in circles of Hell worthy of Dante (or at least David Lynch), these characters keep managing to find their humanity.  When Shawn looks at Momma Boone and holds her hand as if she were not the side show freak that others consider her to be and when Christian can allow himself to actually feel something, their characters stop being cruel jokes.  The revelation of the Carver's identity and the end game of that whole bloody affair are what dominate the final episodes, but for me it was Matt finding his way back from the dark side, even when the mouth of Hell opens up around him, that was the dramatic highpoint of ""Nip/Tuck: The Complete Third Season.""  I want to think that it is all down hill from here and that there is no way the show can top how f****d up everything was this past season, but I think there is ample reason to be more afraid of the producers of ""Nip/Tuck"" that either a scalpel or the Carver.",5,"It is hard to believe how bad things get in the Third Season of ""Nip/Tuck""",1157760000,"09 9, 2006",2006,5396,"['Nip/Tuck',

While you were once sympathetic, you now frown and suck your teeth. He has become pathetic.  And the main storyline, for two seasons now, The Carver is finally revealed and I was so disappointed that I felt cheated. I mean for several episodes, we have had buildup, creative storylines and some clues as to who the dastardly villain is, only to have a twist thrown in there that on the surface would have been better they taken a different avenue.

The 4th season opened sans any normal advertisers, instead with in-house movie promos.  I can't help but think this show would fare much better on HBO or Showtime, rather than on basic cable.The entertainment industry critics seem to think that ""edginess"" is synonymous with quality, and this show has as much edge as a scalpel.  Love it or hate it, it is edgy only for its willingness to show simulated sex, simulated surgery, simulated gore, a teenage boy being duped into a relationship with a transsexual, transsexuals engaging in group urination on a teenage boy, rape, torture, sodomy, and violence on a scale that brings to life the violent fictions portrayed in movies like Videodrome and Clockwork Orange.FX's generous promotion of the show, along with a slew of A-list celebrity cameos clogging the episodes, indicates lots of entertainment industry insiders pulling for this show, in spite of broader public rejection of the program.  Again, why isn't this show located on the premium cable channel equivalent of the red light district?  Nip/Tuck's place on basic cable seems to exist just for the sake of being naughty, like a child who just discovered four-letter profanities and both the corresponding parental disapproval and peer adulation that comes with their new-found potty mouth.FX's effort to keep this program on life support speaks of an agenda that gives credibility to those who accuse the entertainment industry of defining deviancy downward.",2,Why is this on basic cable?,1157500800,"09 6, 2006",2006,1550,"['FX', 'network', 'was', 'bleeding', 'advertisers', 'end', 'third', 'season', 'Nip/Tuck', '4th', 'season', 'opened', 'sans', 'normal', 'advertisers', 'instead', 'in-house', 'movie', 'promos', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'show', 'would', 'fare', 'much', 'better', 'HBO', 'Showtime', 'rather', 'basic', 'cable.The', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'critics', 'seem', 'think', 'edginess', 'synonymous', 'quality', 'show', 'as', 'much', 'edge', 'scalpel', 'Love', 'hate', 'edgy', 'only', 'willingness', 'show', 'simulated', 'sex', 'simulated', 'surgery', 'simulated', 'gore', 'teenage', 'boy', 'being', 'duped', 'relationship', 'transsexual', 'transsexuals', 'engaging', 'group', 'urination', 'teenage', 'boy', 'rape', 'torture', 'sodomy', 'violence', 'scale', 'life', 'violent', 'fictions', 'portrayed', 'movies', 'Videodrome', 'Clockwork', 'Orange.FX', 'generous', 'promotion', 'show', 'slew', 'A-list', 'celebrity', 'cameos', 'clogging', 'episodes', 'lots', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'insiders', 'pulling', 'show', 'spite', 'broader', 'public', 'rejection', 'program', 'Again', 'why', ""n't"", 'show', 'located', 'premium', 'cable', 'channel', 'equivalent', 'red', 'light', 'district', 'Nip/Tuck', 'place', 'basic', 'cable', 'exist', 'just', 'sake', 'being', 'naughty', 'child', 'who', 'just', 'discovered', 'four-letter', 'profanities', 'corresponding', 'parental', 'disapproval', 'peer', 'adulation', 'new-found', 'potty', 'mouth.FX', 'effort', 'keep', 'program', 'life', 'support', 'speaks', 'agenda', 'credibility', 'who', 'accuse', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'defining', 'deviancy', 'downward']",Nip/Tuck: Season 3

From that point on, the season kicks into high gear as Sean and Christian take on a new partner (Bruno Campos), Julia (Joely Richardson) teams up with Liz (Rhoma Maffia) and Gina (Jessalyn Gilsig) as they go into business for themselves, Matt (John Hensley) questions his sexual identity and ends up falling in with a girl and her uber-racist father, and Christian's relationship with Kimber (Kelly Carlson) takes a serious turn, even when they are joined by a kinky cop (Rhona Mitra) assigned to the Carver cases.  There's so much going on throughout this season that it's amazing the way Nip/Tuck manages to weave everything together without getting too redundant.  The surgical cases that Sean and Christian end up getting involved in, including a gigantic woman literally stuck to her sofa, nearly reach unfeasable heights, yet manage to stay compelling.  The only low point of the season comes when Sean considers leaving his old life behind when he begins doing solo work for the Witness Protection Program on an ex-mob wife (Anne Heche) and her son, but thankfully that passes quickly.  When the season comes to a close and the Carver returns and his identity revealed, along with a few other plot points that will be touched on again in the upcoming season, you'll be left wanting more; something which Nip/Tuck has successfully managed to accomplish during it's entire run.

(yes, it was her bathroom too)  Surgery is performed to fix a bad facial scar on Kiki the gorilla, to make her more presentable to mate in a wild kingdom way.  A full facial skin transplant is performed, and Sean and Christian must dismantle ""Frankenlaura"", a pieced together cadaver that a mad mortuary assistant had sewn together.  The surgeons must reason coherently with a man who believes he'll never be whole unless his perfectly healthy leg is amputated. (Body Integrity Identity Disorder)  Mrs. Kringle (Santa's wife) is discovered carrying a 15-year-old petrified fetus in her womb, and through it all The Carver continues to carve and rape.Guests this season include Joan Rivers as herself, Anne Heche as Nicole Morretti in the witness protection program, and a full season performance by Rhona Mitra (Hollow Man) as Detective Kit McGraw.  Also returning is the fabulous Vanessa Redgrave as Julia's mother Dr. Erica Noughton.  By the way, I still miss Escobar.On the plot end, a lot happens this season.  Dr. Quentin Costa (Bruno Campos) joins Sean and Christian when Christian has a hard time returning to work after his Carver attack.  Detective Kit McGraw not only investigates The Carver but strikes up a threesome with Christian and Kimber.  Christian gets arrested as The Carver, Kit tracks down Christian's birth mother, Julia and Gina's new recovery spa creates a j!zz face cream, Sean goes to work for the witness protection program leaving Christian and Quentin to run the clinic, Christian plans a wedding with Kimber, a plane crashes that was supposed to have Julia's mother on board, Matt gets in a fight with Cherry Peck ... a trans$exual, Matt takes up a new girlfriend who happens to be a white supremacist, and Julia becomes pregnant.  While Sean and Christian are separated and Christian is working with Quentin, Christian takes over some of the hesitancy that Sean used to bring to the clinic, which was an interesting role reversal for the main characters.I highly recommend that if you haven't watched the series from the beginning, you should.  Many pieces of the Troy/McNamara puzzle presented in this season won't make sense without the background of the first two seasons.  Plus, I believe seasons one and two were better than season three.  This season, there were less surgeries and more drama, and I tend to love the FX of the surgeries more than the dilemmas of the characters.Nip/Tuck is a guilty pleasure.  It's a show that has no sense and no morals, some reprehensible characters, is overly dramatic, contains ridiculously over-the-top scenarios, and yet is compelling in a ""train wreck"" sort of way.  It's so bad I simply can't look away.  It's so ridiculous that I'm completely addicted to it.  It's the ultimate nighttime soap opera with a decent enough amount of gore thrown in with the surgeries that it has a special appeal to horror fans with open minds.  My major complaint with season three is that it went light on the surgeries and focused too much on the drama.  The Carver turned out to be a surprise, with a little surprise of his own to reveal in the end, giving a satisfactory ending to The Carver's storyline.  Let's hope season four has more surgeries.Another note of interest is the soundtrack to the series.  Playing Queen's ""Fat Bottom Girls"" during a hinder lipo is genius.  The only season that sold a soundtrack was season one, and I highly recommend purchasing the soundtrack CD, which is excellent.  I just wish they would release soundtracks to seasons two and three now.  The music selected really compliments the surgeries and other scenes in the series.Though I hate to admit it, I highly recommend this series.  It's the ultimate of guilty pleasures.
