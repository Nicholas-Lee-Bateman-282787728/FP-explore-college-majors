You have an All Star cast, De Niro, Stallone, Alan Arkin, and Kevin Hart.  The chemistry between all of these actors was just perfect. It was a comedy, which I am  not a huge fan of, and it was also serious. It also takes on many other topics concerning sports, fatherhood, forgiveness, love, woman, children, and of course boxing. But you don't have to know anything about boxing or sports to understand this movie.This movie in short is funny and most of all so much fun!!!  I cant remember when I said or thought to myself a movie was fun. I did not want it to end.  If you are watching this and taking it to seriously, or if you have more of a stoic sense of humor this is not for you. If you are fun, out going, and enjoy people this is absolutely for you. It is not for children. There are parts that have a touch of bad language but in my life, it would not be noticed one bit. This movie is something I promise you will laugh out loud, and you will want to see it more then once.  I will say Kevin Hart adds to this movie in a huge way. I never knew he was this funny.  If you rent the one with bonus features you understand what I mean.  I don't want to give it away, so I am leaving a lot out.  I cant even imagine there is not tons of people who love at least one of these actors work. Kim Basinger is also in it. She plays her role perfect.  It is an easy movie, nothing epic, nothing to serious even though there are topics in here that are. They are able to pull off humor all the way through. I think it is just a must see if you want some fun, and you want to laugh.  These are legends on the screen, and they are all having fun. There are some surprises in the film as well that they don't advertise. I wont say what. But you should really give this movie a chance. Don't listen to anything negative in reviews.  If you like these actors?  Then you have to see it.  You will come away feeling good, and most of all, laughing really hard. I think that is priceless.  I loved it and happy I bought it.  If you want to know what it is about, watch the trailer, or just the title alone. That is the main theme.  Two fighters who had one win a piece.  The rubber match, or the third match would decide who was better.  That is the theme. But so much more happens.

Despite some throwaway gags involving raw egg consumption and punching slabs of meat this is a pretty straightforward drama with comic overtones about two geriatric pugs with a score to settle.  The film is somewhat formulaic but if you give in to its charms you will enjoy it immensely.  The actors are uniformly excellent and Sylvester Stallone more than stands his own with Robert De Niro.  If you saw Stallone in Walter Hill's &#34;Bullet to the Head&#34; you will appreciate the rebirth of the Stallion in his golden years  Good supporting cast includes Kim Basinger as the love interest and Kevin Hart as the promoter for the proposed bout between the adversaries.  Minor quibble is Alan Arkin may be a little young to play Stallone's father but his comic presence is always welcome,4,Sly and Robbie Together Again,1397347200,"04 13, 2014",2014,875,"['promos', 'film', 'led', 'believe', 'was', 'spoof', 'boxing', 'genre', 'throwaway', 'gags', 'involving', 'raw', 'egg', 'consumption', 'punching', 'slabs', 'meat', 'pretty', 'straightforward', 'drama', 'comic', 'overtones', 'two', 'geriatric', 'pugs', 'score', 'settle', 'film', 'somewhat', 'formulaic', 'give', 'charms', 'will', 'enjoy', 'immensely', 'actors', 'are', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'more', 'own', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'saw', 'Stallone', 'Walter', 'Hill', '34', 'Bullet', 'Head', '34', 'will', 'appreciate', 'rebirth', 'Stallion', 'golden', 'years', 'Good', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'love', 'interest', 'Kevin', 'Hart', 'promoter', 'proposed', 'bout', 'adversaries', 'Minor', 'quibble', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'young', 'play', 'Stallone', 'father', 'comic', 'presence', 'always', 'welcome']",Grudge Match

Then I read some really harsh reviews for it and thought "" well these guys have picked a few clunkers during their careers, maybe this is one of them?"" Despite some bad scripts they usually give it their all so.......I decided to rent this and give it a shot. I wasn't expecting Citizen Kane not even Rocky Balboa, but I was surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. It was nothing like I expected which was a "" dumb dumb comedy"" with some really stupid dialogue and stale jokes about arthritis etc.What was expected to be a flat out comedy (names like Kevin Hart in the cast solidified this) turned out to be a sweet endearing little film about two ex boxers who hate each other for various reasons, but end up coming to terms with their differences and in the end gain each others respect.Grudge Match isn't going to win any awards, but if you like the cast (Alan Arkin is golded here!) and can just relax and take the ride, you will probably enjoy this film.  You'll never see ""The Rock"" and ""The Raging Bull"" in the ring together again....unless this movie somehow makes a ton of money? ;-)  The Blu Ray look and sounds great with some interesting song choices.

1689241,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00HEQO9DM,FNDNreview,"[3, 9]","On paper, the idea to pit two of the greatest onscreen boxing characters against one another seems like a captivating idea.  In one corner, you have Sylvester Stallone who was propelled into stardom when he wrote and cast himself in the highly acclaimed 1976 boxing drama, Rocky.  Moviegoers instantly fell in love with Rocky Balboa, which would lead to five successful sequels before all was said and done.  In the other corner, you have living legend Robert De Niro.  By the time he starred as Jake LaMotta in Martin Scorsese&#8217;s 1980 boxing drama, Raging Bull, De Niro was already a monster success &#8211; winning an Academy Award for his role in The Godfather II.  Now, more than 30 years later since the success of their respective films, both men are in the twilight of their careers and are facing off in the boxing flick, Grudge Match.Directed by Peter Segal (The Longest Yard, 50 First Dates), Grudge Match stars Sylvester Stallone as Henry &#8220;Razor&#8221; Sharp and Robert De Niro as Billy &#8220;The Kid&#8221; McDonnen.  It&#8217;s been 30 years since Razor and The Kid have squared off against one another.  Their first match went to the final round, and eventually going to The Kid, while the rematch was decided quickly going to Razor.  Surprisingly, while both men were in their primes and with a third match on the horizon, Razor suddenly retired without reason.Thirty years have passed and the third match that never was still looms large.  When an anniversary news piece reinvigorates the rivalry, it prompts the son of a late boxing promoter, Dante Slate Jr. (Kevin Hart), to attempt to lure them back in the ring together &#8211; regardless of their age and shape.  Although Razor is reluctant and hates The Kid with a passion, he has bills to pay after recently being laid off from his job.  The Kid&#8217;s ambition is much more personal and he simply wants the rematch so he can prove he&#8217;s the better man.With the rematch green lit, Razor turns to his trusted friend and former trainer, Lightning (Alan Arkin), for training &#8211; who actually resides in an old folks him.  Against his better judgment, Lightning decides to move in with Razor and train him.  The Kid, on the other hand, turns to a high profile trainer, Frankie Brite (LL Cool J) &#8211; even despite their lack of chemistry together.  However, The Kid unexpectedly meets his illegitimate, middle-aged son, BJ (Jon Berthal), who wants to get to know his father and abruptly decides he wants to train him.  Naturally, BJ&#8217;s mother, Sally (Kim Basinger) is the woman who came between Razor and The Kid all those years ago.If you&#8217;re wondering how entertaining a film about a 70 year old (De Niro) preparing to fight someone pushing 70 years old (Stallone is 67) could possibly be &#8211; the quick answer is not very entertaining at all.  As I stated in the introduction, the premise of this film is something quite a few fans of Rocky and Raging Bull would want to watch &#8211; maybe 25 years ago.  Both De Niro and Stallone still star in films like they&#8217;re in the prime of their careers, but in reality, they are way over the hill and rarely find themselves at the top of the box office (with the exception of Stallone in The Expendables &#8211; which is mostly a major group effort).From Stallone, you&#8217;ll get about exactly what you&#8217;d expect from him. He rarely changes his acting style regardless of the film, so whether he&#8217;s trying to break out of a prison in Escape Plan or he&#8217;s killing bad guys in Bullet to the Head, he&#8217;s still the same old generic Stallone. His co-star, Robert De Niro, has had a career full of acclaim, but now he is guilty of taking roles just to earn a pay check, which is evident in his recent films, like The Family or Killing Season. Also in typical De Niro fashion, he plays the loose canon that can&#8217;t be controlled.  He has to lose everything just to understand what he had &#8211; a lesson you&#8217;d think his character would have learned by the time he reached 70 years old.Oddly enough, it&#8217;s the supporting cast that really shines in this film.  Kevin Hart, a well-established comedian, continues to expand his acting career &#8211; and even though this particular film lags most of the time, Hart is responsible for what enjoyment it does possess.  His exchanges with the charmingly funny Alan Arkin (which are well advertised in the film&#8217;s commercials) are the high point of the film.  It&#8217;s pretty safe to say that without Hart&#8217;s loud, attention-drawing dialogue, and Arkin&#8217;s mellow one-lines and dancing maneuvers, this film would be a total debacle of epic proportions.  Unfortunately, even Hart and Arkin suffer at times during certain scenes from lackluster writing and dud jokes.Overall, Grudge Match would have made for a great movie idea two decades ago.  Instead, this film features two over-the-hill actors that are desperate to stay in the limelight.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, Stallone and De Niro will go down as two of the all-time greats, but roles of this nature are far from amusing &#8211; and more depressing than anything else.  There are sporadic moments of cheap pops and chuckles, but ultimately, the plot falls flat and ends on a shrug.  At a lengthy two hours, the film is about 40 minutes too long and features a story told too many times before to garner any kind of positive recommendation.  However, the brief cameo by two well-known boxers during the credits almost makes it worth sitting through the whole film.  Almost.  At the end of the day, this film has rental written all over it.GRADE:  D+FNDNreview.com",2,A 'Grudge Match' decades too late,1388275200,"12 29, 2013",2013,5667,"['paper', 'idea', 'pit', 'two',

But as Stallone has reached the twilight of his career, I began to look back on his progression as an actor. And it struck me that I had seen this before - in The Duke.Consider this: It's the spring of 1970. The Academy Awards are being presented.In what was without question the peak of The Anti-Establishment Movement and the nexus of liberal America - Hollywood - for his indelible and unforgettable work in 'True Grit (1969)', the academy presented The Best Actor statue to none other than John Wayne.John Wayne. The embodiment of The Establishment. The very object of derision across the social spectrum in 1970. He won for Best Actor.Why?Why would Hollywood - the heart and soul of counterculture - give that man the top award for male thespians? He should have been shunned, laughed out of contention, but wasn't. He beat out Peter O'Toole, Richard Burton, and BOTH Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman - only the second time in history the Academy nominated two male leads in the same film.John Wayne came up on top. He won.Why?Because despite all the rhetoric, all the anger over the war in V&iacute;et Nam, and the passion of the liberals - even they saw that the man had delivered a superlative performance. Maybe the best performance of his entire career.That kind of dispassionate objectivity - sadly lost to us nowadays - is what defines iconic film. John Wayne earned the Best Actor Oscar for a wonderful performance. Period. None of the extraneous civil discord had anything to do with one actor in one film. The man who had become the very representation of ""everything wrong"" had stepped outside his own cultural shadow and delivered.So, just like we use the name ""Rambo"" as a laughable verb and snide adjective - I look at Stallone - the actor.He's not the same man he was a generation ago. Shockingly, he's become an actual thespian. I don't think general audiences, who are distracted more than ever, has really looked at him in a role for a while now. Admittedly, he's not likely to ever win a competitive acting Oscar. But has he, over the past decades, learned enough of the craft to present a believable character? Has he the skill to step into the life of a fictional person and make it seem real?Yes.So I offer this film recommendation. A very decent movie with Oscar winners De Niro, Basinger, and the eternal Alan Arkin (one of my all-time favorite actors) delivering in another solid Peter Segal vehicle. No big surprises, the retread plot one that has been done a thousand times before - but in this film - done with excellence. Also props to Josh Bernthal, glad to see him moving up from the small screen. Notice, I didn't say ""walking"" toward a brighter future. &lt;g>Personal Notes:- I won't spoil the hilarious cameos. But if you're a fan of real-life grudge matches - trust me - worth every penny to see this flick. &lt;rofl>- Why they didn't get Tommy Hearns and Marvin Hagler into the production is a sad mystery.",4,Is Sly this generation's John Wayne?,1392508800,"02 16, 2014",2014,3041,"['would', ""'ve"", 'laughed', 'had', 'someone', 'asked', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'Heck', 'little', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'Stallone', 'reached', 'twilight', 'career', 'began', 'look', 'back', 'progression', 'actor', 'struck', 'had', 'seen', 'Duke.Consider', 'spring', '1970', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'are', 'being', 'what', 'was', 'question', 'peak', 'Anti-Establishment', 'Movement', 'nexus', 'liberal', 'America', 'Hollywood', 'indelible', 'unforgettable', 'work', ""'True"", 'Grit', '1969', 'academy', 'presented', 'Best', 'Actor', 'statue', 'none', 'other', 'John', 'Wayne.John', 'Wayne', 'embodiment', 'Establishment', 'very', 'object', 'derision', 'social', 'spectrum', '1970', 'won', 'Best', 'Actor.Why', 'Why', 'would', 'Hollywood', 'heart', 'soul', 'counterculture', 'give', 'man', 'top', 'award', 'male', 'thespians', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'shunned', 'laughed', 'contention', 'was', ""n't"", 'beat', 'out', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Richard', 'Burton', 'BOTH', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'only', 'second', 'time', 'history', 'Academy', 'nominated', 'two', 'male', 'leads', 'same', 'film.John', 'Wayne', 'came', 'up', 'top', 'won.Why', 'rhetoric', 'anger', 'war', 'V', 'iacute', 'Nam', 'passion', 'liberals', 'even', 'saw', 'man', 'had', 'delivered', 'superlative', 'performance', 'Maybe', 'best', 'performance', 'entire', 'career.That', 'kind', 'dispassionate', 'objectivity', 'sadly', 'lost', 'nowadays', 'what', 'iconic', 'film', 'John', 'Wayne', 'earned', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Period', 'None', 'extraneous', 'civil', 'discord', 'had', 'anything', 'do', 'one', 'actor', 'one', 'film', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'become', 'very', 'representation', 'everything', 'wrong', 'had', 'stepped', 'own', 'cultural', 'shadow', 'delivered.So', 'just', 'use', 'name', 'Rambo', 'laughable', 'verb', 'snide', 'adjective', 'look', 'Stallone', 'actor.He', 'not', 'same', 'man', 'was', 'generation', 'ago', 'Shockingly', 'become', 'actual', 'thespian', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'general', 'audiences', 'who', 'are', 'distracted', 'more', 'ever', 'really', 'looked', 'role', 'while', 'now', 'Admittedly', 'not', 'likely', 'ever', 'win', 'competitive', 'acting', 'Oscar', 'past', 'decades', 'learned', 'enough', 'craft', 'present', 'believable', 'character', 'skill', 'step', 'life', 'fictional', 'person', 'make', 'seem', 'real', 'Yes.So', 'offer', 'film', 'recommendation', 'very', 'decent', 'movie', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'De', 'Niro', 'Basinger', 'eternal', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'actors', 'delivering', 'solid', 'Peter', 'Segal', 'vehicle', 'big', 'surprises', 'retread', 'plot', 'one', 'been', 'done', 'thousand', 'times', 'film', 'done', 'excellence', 'Also', 'Josh', 'Bernthal', 'glad', 'see', 'moving', 'up', 'small', 'screen', 'Notice', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'walking', 'brighter', 'future', 'lt', '>', 'Personal', 'Notes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'hilarious', 'cameos', ""'re"", 'fan', 'real-life', 'grudge', 'matches', 'trust', 'worth', 'penny', 'see', 'flick', 'lt', '>', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Tommy', 'Hearns', 'Marvin', 'Hagler', 'production', 'sad', 'mystery']",Grudge Match

The way the writers beat the jokes to death you'd think they were ex L.A.P.D.There are way too many plot points and they are ALL film school cliches that the producers should have chopped if the writers didn't. On page 12 THIS should happen, on page 21 THIS should happen. SNORE, SNORE, SNORE... It's too bad, because there's a good, funny movie buried in here somewhere. This script feels about 60 pages too long.That said, the fight scene at the end is very well shot and choreographed, much more effort was put into it then I was expecting (veteran Dean Semmler (sic) is the photog. Alan Arkin gets some of the best lines (though the ADR is shaky, a lot of the good lines are either lost or stepped on in the mix). The references to ""Rocky"" and ""Raging Bull"" are generally funny and not too overdone, though I've seen some complaints.Stallone works in The Expendables because he is essentially the straight man for the wack-jobs on his team, and his pained reactions and one-liners work and are funny because they are used sparingly. In Grudge, he has too much screen time and not enough to do and the script is too repetitive with what there is. De Niro is of course De Niro, no surprises here. Kim Basinger is, well, Kim Basinger. Don't expect any actual acting.I'm bummed, because the trailer was funny, both the leads are charismatic and charming, the concept is fun because of the unspoken concept of Rocky and Raging Bull.

The Kid has never gotten over it and the two still have bitter hatred toward each other. When Razor needs a way to make money he agrees to film himself for a video game. When Kid shows up early old wounds come up and the two go after each other. A promoter sees an opening and the third fight is finally scheduled. I watch so many movies whether I want to or not that it's hard to get super excited about watching most movies now. This is an exception. I was really looking forward to seeing this one. I thought the idea was OK but the casting was great. Finally the question will be answered who is a better fighter Rocky or Jake &#34;Raging Bull&#34; La Motta? While I can't say this is a great movie or one I would watch over and over it was very fun and enjoyable to watch. There were a few in-jokes about those two movies which made it that much funnier.

I know when I saw it at the cinema I too had told my wife I'd be searching the mall for her Christmas gift.  That I already had ordered on this very wondrous website.  I took in this movie for 90min to get away from the overbearing spectacle that Holiday shopping has become.  And I was not alone.  A good 23% of the theater also had seats occupied by middle aged men seeking the same respite.Still and all in between a few moments dozing off here and there I did try to gather as best I could as to what was transpiring between Mr. DeNiro and Mr. Balboa on the silver screen.  At the time I mistook their laudable half assed attempts of acting as serious intent.  But the script and that oddly weird little Kevin Hart sure was distracting the proceedings as being the least bit interesting.  The horrid CGI they used to replicate a younger DeNiro and Balboa would have been better used trying to add at least 4 inches to Kevin Hart.At least the movie had Alan Arkin.  That guy still has got it.  But at one point I did try to do the math regarding Kim Basinger's character being passed around between the combatants and they may have been close to some R Kelly behavior if i did the numbers right.But whatever this movie was to me that day it did keep me out of the shopping malls and food courts so for that I'll give it all of 1 whole star.

When I saw the trailer for it, I thought that it looked like a comedy with a healthy dose of heart.  When I saw the movie itself...I realized it was an &#34;idea&#34; picture surrounded by filler.For a basic plot summary, &#34;Grudge Match&#34; tells the two of two rival boxers who each beat the other one time, setting up what was to be a hugely popular &#34;rubber match&#34;.  Before the fight could take place, however, Henry &#34;Razor&#34; Sharp (Sylvester Stallone) walked away from the sport, leaving Billy &#34;The Kid&#34; McDonnen (Robert De Niro) to stew over what could have been.  Thirty years later, both fighters meet up again at a motion-capture exercise for a new video game coming out.  They still have as much vitriol and hatred for each other as before, and thus the rivalry is rekindled.  When the prospect of a huge $$$ purse is dangled before their eyes, they agree to step in the ring one final time to settle the score once and for all.The trouble with this movie is two-fold:First, Stallone has never achieved any comedic success (besides perhaps &#34;Avenging Angelo&#34;, but that wasn't supposed to even BE a comedy)...period!  When it comes to the comedy of this film, De Niro runs circles around Stallone.  Since they both share about equal screen time, the Sly comedy scenes get a bit tough to stomach.  Plus, as usual, Kevin Hart's brand of comedy is very much an acquired taste (one that this reviewer hasn't come around to).Secondly, even the best of comedy movies have to contain some heart or &#34;meat&#34; behind them, and &#34;Grudge Match&#34; fails miserably in that department.  The backstory involving Kim Basinger's character just isn't interesting enough to make you care about what should be the emotional punch of the movie.Granted, there are some positives to this film (hence the 2 stars instead of just a single).  Some jokes (especially for those intimately familiar with Stallone and De Niro's past works) are laugh-out-loud funny, while the end fight scene is probably the best part of the entire movie (where Stallone really gets to shine).However, it is quite clear that the &#34;Rocky vs Raging Bull&#34; concept is what fueled this movie, and that just wasn't enough to carry a two-hour film.  &#34;Grudge Match&#34; isn't terrible, but I have absolutely no desire to watch it again, either.",2,"""Rocky vs. Raging Bull"" Can't Carry An Entire Film",1388016000,"12 26, 2013",2013,2481,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'concept', 'film', 'thought', 'whole', '34', 'Rocky', 'vs', 'Raging', 'Bull', '34', 'angle', 'was', 'interesting', 'When', 'saw', 'trailer', 'thought', 'looked', 'comedy', 'healthy', 'dose', 'heart', 'When', 'saw', 'movie', 'realized', 'was', '34', 'idea', '34', 'picture', 'surrounded', 'filler.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', '34', 'Grudge', 'Match', '34', 'two', 'two', 'rival', 'boxers', 'who', 'beat', 'other', 'one', 'time', 'setting', 'up', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'hugely', 'popular', '34', 'rubber', 'match', '34', 'fight', 'could', 'take', 'place', 'however', 'Henry', '34', 'Razor', '34', 'Sharp', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'walked', 'away', 'sport', 'leaving', 'Billy', '34', 'Kid', '34', 'McDonnen', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'stew', 'over', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Thirty', 'years', 'later', 'fighters', 'meet', 'up', 'again', 'motion-capture', 'exercise', 'new', 'video', 'game', 'coming', 'out', 'still', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'vitriol', 'hatred', 'other', 'thus', 'rivalry', 'rekindled', 'When', 'prospect', 'huge', 'purse', 'dangled', 'eyes', 'agree', 'step', 'ring', 'one', 'final', 'time', 'settle', 'score', 'once', 'all.The', 'trouble', 'movie', 'two-fold', 'First', 'Stallone', 'never', 'achieved', 'comedic', 'success', 'perhaps', '34', 'Avenging', 'Angelo', '34', 'was', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'even', 'BE', 'comedy', 'period', 'When', 'comedy', 'film', 'De', 'Niro', 'circles', 'Stallone', 'share', 'equal', 'screen', 'time', 'Sly', 'comedy', 'scenes', 'get', 'bit', 'tough', 'stomach', 'usual', 'Kevin', 'Hart', 'brand', 'comedy', 'very', 'much', 'acquired', 'taste', 'one', 'reviewer', ""n't"", 'come', '.Secondly', 'even', 'best', 'comedy', 'movies', 'have', 'contain', 'heart', '34', 'meat', '34', '34', 'Grudge', 'Match', '34', 'fails', 'miserably', 'department', 'backstory', 'involving', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'character', 'just', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'enough', 'make', 'care', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'emotional', 'punch', 'movie.Granted', 'are', 'positives', 'film', 'hence', '2', 'stars', 'instead', 'just', 'single', 'jokes', 'especially', 'intimately', 'familiar', 'Stallone', 'De', 'Niro', 'past', 'works', 'are', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'end', 'fight', 'scene', 'probably', 'best', 'part', 'entire', 'movie', 'where', 'Stallone', 'really', 'shine', '.However', 'quite', 'clear', '34', 'Rocky', 'Raging', 'Bull', '34', 'concept', 'what', 'fueled', 'movie', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'carry', 'two-hour', 'film', '34', 'Grudge', 'Match', '34', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'have', 'absolutely', 'desire', 'watch', 'again', 'either']",Grudge Match
