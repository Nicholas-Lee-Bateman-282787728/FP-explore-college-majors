371371,A1LU3HTVV2QPBC,6303383076,Lloyd A. Fradkin,"[0, 0]","I first saw this film when it came out at the La Reina Theatre in Sherman Oaks, California. I thought it boring for a John Wayne film. Of course I was only 12 and age does mellow ones tastes.I just recieved the Brazilian DVD release of the film and enjoyed it with a differant perspective.To begin with the film is a nice retelling of the story of Townsend Harris, if slim of substance. The reason: this is not the film John Wayne and John Huston set out to make. When Huston presented his self-edited cut to 20th Century Fox they shorten and re-edited the film. Which explains at least two of the voice overs by the Geisha to fill the viewer in as to what transpired between scenes. Also, evident is how in one scene she can't speak a word of English and in the next she is conversing with Harris. Huston wanted his name removed from the final cut and 20th said he had a contract and Directed by John Huston remains. Huston also was attempting to shoot his film like the Japanese directors and so we will never know what his vision really looked like.As to Wayne yes he seems out of his element, but I think this may also have been partly due to the cutting of the original longer version. Again his relationship with the Geshia is to fast and something is missing. Yes, he also delivers some lines like John Wayne very stilted, but he also seems the perfect fish out of water as an 1858's American finding himself in Feudal Japan and he's in his element when addressing the Shogan.Overall if you just go with the film and its sudden, too quick ending.Again something has to be missing. I think the viewer will enjoy themselves and isn't that the purpose of film? Also you just may get a little history lesson along the way.",5,Hysterial Wayne?

371372,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,6303383076,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","Sadly, this is not a good film. Watchable, but that's all. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.1. The real story.This film is indeed based on a true story. By the signature of first American-Japanese treaty in 1854 (Convention of Kanagawa), two Japanese ports were opened for trade with Americans, guaranteed the safety of American sailors wrecked on Japanese coasts and allowed the opening of an American consulate in Shimoda. In 1856 president Pierce send to Japan first such US Consul General, Townsend Harris. After his arrival Harris demanded the courtesies due to an accredited envoy and refused to deliver president's Pierce letter to any one but to the Tokugawa Shogun in Edo. Negotiations lasted 18 months before Harris finally received an audience of the Shogun. Four months later he successfully negotiated the Treaty of Amity and Commerce (Harris Treaty of 1858), setting clear rules for trade between the US and Japan. After a succesful five years term Harris returned to the United States in 1861, retired soon after and died in 1878, aged 73.During his stay in Japan Harris was assisted by Henry Heusken, a young diplomat fluent in Chinese and Japanese (he was only 24 at his arrival in Japan with Harris). Tragically, at the very end of his term of service, he was murdered in January 1861 by a group of anti-foreign extremists from Satsuma province. His diary about the almost five years spend in Japan was conserved and later published by Harris, together with his own diary, as tribute to his loyal collaborator. This film is based on both accounts by Harris and Heusken.According to a tenacious legend, soon after his arrival Harris received from Japanese authorities a 17-year-old girl named Okichi as a kind of semi-official concubine. Okichi was supposedly later ostracized after Harris departure, eventually committing suicide in 1892. Beginning soon after 1861, the story of Okichi and her ""barbarian"" master was quickly re-told and changed so many times, that it is now all but impossible to find out what is the truth and what is legend. Some sources question even the fact of her existence. Others claim that she was just a maid and that Harris barely saw her, as she worked for him a grand total of three days. Yet elsewhere there is a claim that she was a street orphan Harris adopted. In other sources she was a professional geisha whose contract was purchased by authorities and who was offered to Harris as a welcome gift and an apology after initially very cold reception. Some stories about Harris and Okichi are in fact soft-porn rather than anything else - others try to tell it as a tragedy. Some sources claim, she suicided, other that she didn't. Some say she was ostracized, some say she wasn't, etc, etc. As every year there are new ""developments"" - after all let's never the truth stand in the way of a good story - the truth with capital T will most certainly never more be known...2. The film and my impressionsThe film tells just the story of first 18 months of Harris mission, until the solemn audience with shogun himself at Edo, and therefore doesn't mention Heusken assassination or Okichi's fate after Harris departure. Sadly, for reasons known only to him, director John Huston changed a lot of things as compared with nthe real story. Henry Heusken, who was in real story 24 at his arrival in Japan with Harris, is played here by Sam Jaffe, who was at that moment... 67 years old! I couldn't see any reason in the scenario why it was done.More seriously, the audience at Edo in 1858 was granted to Harris by Tokugawa Iesada, the 13th shogun, who was at that time 34 years old. But in the film Harris is received by a 12 years old boy and the solemn audience is just an occasion to some jokes and child play! I think that the lack of seriousness of those important final scenes, which were supposed to be the crowning moment for the ""barbarian"" who endured so much to arrive there, was a MAJOR blunder by this renowned director.John Wayne plays well, as always, but the weak scenario limits him seriously. The relation between Harris and Okichi is completely vague and NEVER explained! Is she his concubine? Is she just a main? Is this a kind of father/daughter relationship? Well, do not expect any answers fromp this film! That is another serious blunder!Japanese are portrayed in this film in a not very succesful way, as people who do not really act rationally or logically and who follow strange and unreasonable customs. To some extent they are almost portrayed as naive wildlings - and the audience at Edo is sadly one of such moments... The character of Japanese governor Tamura who is the main Japanese contact of Harris is very, very poorly done - even if Japanese actor So Yamamura did all he could. But there is only so much even a good actor can do when the scenario sucks...The film is slow and lacks most of wit and humor so important in most of John Wayne's films, except for one scene, in which Harris learns that a dwarf knowing jujitsu is a more serious opponent than his huge brother, the sumoka...)))On another hand, Japanese actress Eiko Ando, selected for this film not only for her beauaty but also her height (Huston didn't want pair the towering ""Duke"" with a girl who would reach barely to his chest) is sweet and lovely. Born in 1934 Eiko Ando is still with us as of September 2013John Huston certainly messed this film up and he also had a very bad relationship with Wayne to the point that both gentlemen had finally a regular fistfight! But he is not the only one to blame, because the film, once finished, was extremely heavily edited by 20th Century Fox. When Huston saw the edited version he almost dropped dead! He immediately asked for the removal of his name from credits - but unsuccessfully... Huston always claimed since that the final version, re-cut by the studio, didn't resemble his vision at all... Well, maybe - but as the original version is now definitely lost, we will never know for sure...The film bombed at box office and frankly, I fully understand why.CONCLUSION: a film watchable, but barely. Recommened only for the hardest John Wayne's fans (guilty Your Honor) or to amateurs of curiosities (ditto). For anybody else it will probably be a disappointing experience.",3,"Well, I guess, it is always a pleasure to watch the ""Duke"" - even in his weaker films...",1379635200,"09 20,

It's the story, embellished, of our first diplomat, Townsend Harris, to take up office in the Japan of the Shogunate. His entrance, very much opposed by the Samurai of the time, was gained by the muscle provided by Commodore Perry's fleet of &#34;Black Ships&#34; appearing off the coast of Japan in 1853. The Tokugawa Shogunate had effectively &#34;sealed&#34; off Japan for approximately 200 years from foreign interactions (save but a small colony of Portuguese restricted to a port in the south). Perry's arrival in ships POWERED BY STEAM, ships that went AGAINST the tides (Japanese boats were restricted to flat bottomed affairs powered by sails), was akin to the arrival of foreigners in space craft. This also was the catalyst of Japan's eventual shedding of the primitive ways and swiftly becoming a modern power ... and the resultant consequences of that swift transformation during the turbulent early 1900s through WWII.

It was quite a surprise for me to see this movie available at Amazon.  I recommended it to my brother and we both watched it.  Both of us have not seen this movie before and we do not have any idea on the accuracy of the main character Townsend Harris in the movie.  All we know is that he was the first Consul General of the United States to Japan.  He negotiated the ""Harris Treaty"" between Japan and the United States which started trade between the two nations.  Going back to the movie, it was very well made and to see the duke in that role was very enlightening.  With the direction by John Huston, there is the familiarity with the other films John Wayne made under his directorship.  I do recommend this movie not as a historical artifact but as one of the movies that personified the quality of the Duke.  There will be other reviews about this movie but for those who are fans of the Duke, John Wayne, this is a must have for your collection.  It is a wonderful acquisition having it both in blu-ray and DVD.
