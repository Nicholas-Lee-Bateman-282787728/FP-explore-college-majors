My personal challenge was to find one redeeming trait for Hanssen.He betrayed his country to the max, was the worst husband to a devoted wife and an embarrassment to the Opus Dei. Reluctantly, I am giving him the benefit (why I don't know) that he could have been a good father. I have met and read about a few scumbags in my time, but I wrack my brain to think of anybody who comes even close to beating him in that department. In ancient times, the proper punishment for this loser would be for him to be publicly stoned.

743809,A17JVI15BRY90P,B00008K7AU,James T. Wheeler,"[0, 0]","This film has its faults but is a useful companion piece to ""Breach,"" the far superior production.  As other reviewers say, ""Master Spy"" does seem to dwell on the titillating aspects of the story at the expense of plot, but the movie does have its moments.  William Hurt does well as an understated Robert Hanssen in contrast to the angry, paranoid performance of Chris Cooper in ""Breach.""  Nevertheless, Cooper's depth of acting is undoubtedly closer to the real Hanssen and is much more convincing than the laid-back depiction in ""Master Spy.""Among other shortcomings, ""Master Spy"" says nothing about the Eric O'Neill character that is so key in ""Breach.""  Similarly, the Laura Linney character in ""Breach"" was omitted.  One has to wonder if there were technical or security reasons for this or if it was just that the writer and director wanted to focus on other aspects.  Whatever the cause, a major dramatic feature was missed in ""Master Spy"" which is why I can only give the film three stars.To its credit, ""Master Spy"" does show that there were financial reasons why Hanssen started spying.  Also, from a psychological standpoint, how the role of an abusive father may have distorted the young Robert Hanssen.  In any case, I'd recommend that a viewer see ""Breach,"" first, and then supplement the story with ""Master Spy.""  The scene at the end, with William Hurt in solitary confinement, is unforgettable.",3,Useful Companion Piece,1310256000,"07 10, 2011",2011,1412,"['film', 'faults', 'useful', 'companion', 'piece', 'Breach', 'far', 'superior', 'production', 'other', 'reviewers', 'say', 'Master', 'Spy', 'seem', 'dwell', 'titillating', 'aspects', 'story', 'expense', 'plot', 'movie', 'have', 'moments', 'William', 'Hurt', 'well', 'understated', 'Robert', 'Hanssen', 'contrast', 'angry', 'paranoid', 'performance', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Breach', 'Nevertheless', 'Cooper', 'depth', 'acting', 'undoubtedly', 'closer', 'real', 'Hanssen', 'much', 'more', 'convincing', 'laid-back', 'depiction', 'Master', 'Spy', 'other', 'shortcomings', 'Master', 'Spy', 'nothing', 'Eric', ""O'Neill"", 'character', 'so', 'key', 'Breach', 'Similarly', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'character', 'Breach', 'was', 'omitted', 'One', 'wonder', 'were', 'technical', 'security', 'reasons', 'was', 'just', 'writer', 'director', 'wanted', 'focus', 'other', 'aspects', 'cause', 'major', 'dramatic', 'feature', 'was', 'missed', 'Master', 'Spy', 'why', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'film', 'three', 'stars.To', 'credit', 'Master', 'Spy', 'show', 'were', 'financial', 'reasons', 'why', 'Hanssen', 'started', 'spying', 'Also', 'psychological', 'standpoint', 'how', 'role', 'abusive', 'father', 'may', 'have', 'distorted', 'young', 'Robert', 'Hanssen', 'case', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'viewer', 'see', 'Breach', 'first', 'then', 'supplement', 'story', 'Master', 'Spy', 'scene', 'end', 'William', 'Hurt', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'unforgettable']",Master Spy: Robert Hanssen Story

I could not believe how much I had to hear about the strippers life story...oops wrong movie,especally with a poor actor. As I understand it Robert Hanssen did see this movie and thought it was a howl. Now I will tell you why, Mr Schiller made 'friends' with the important parties. He brags about being able to get Hanssens best friend to talk to him, and then writes his(Jacks) version. Then gets his kids(Roberts) to talk to him with their version(of which they were confering with Robert)oh boy another slanted view. Next we get the life story of the stripper!!! oh yes I am sooooo interested in that!!!! And he brags about sending these people the script and tell you how up front he was,nothing to hide, Yes it was their SLANT,how stupid.At no time did it occur to him that the relationship between Robert and Jack was a homosexual relationship,without touching. They shared sex. By having Jack watch him have sex,he could imagine he was with Jack. If Robert could have had Jack have sex with his wife he could have really gotten off,thinking about Jack. This acually is very clear what his strange sexual fantasies were all about,but Schiller was too busy telling you who he had talked to,to think for himself.He will tell you what a BIG star Pace was going to be,how he discovered her,he forgot to give her acting lessons.So if you want to watch a movie with true facts but slanted to everyones view point but the SPY.",1,Shillers ego ruined this movie,1367193600,"04 29, 2013",2013,1464,"['actors', 'Pace', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'how', 'much', 'had', 'hear', 'strippers', 'life', 'story', 'wrong', 'movie', 'especally', 'poor', 'actor', 'understand', 'Robert', 'Hanssen', 'did', 'see', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'howl', 'Now', 'will', 'tell', 'why', 'Mr', 'Schiller', 'made', ""'friends"", 'important', 'parties', 'being', 'able', 'get', 'Hanssens', 'best', 'friend', 'talk', 'then', 'Jacks', 'version', 'Then', 'kids', 'Roberts', 'talk', 'version', 'were', 'confering', 'Robert', 'boy', 'slanted', 'view', 'get', 'life', 'story', 'stripper', 'oh', 'yes', 'am', 'sooooo', 'interested', 'sending', 'people', 'script', 'tell', 'how', 'up', 'front', 'was', 'nothing', 'hide', 'Yes', 'was', 'SLANT', 'how', 'stupid.At', 'time', 'did', 'occur', 'relationship', 'Robert', 'Jack', 'was', 'homosexual', 'relationship', 'touching', 'shared', 'sex', 'having', 'Jack', 'watch', 'have', 'sex', 'could', 'imagine', 'was', 'Jack', 'Robert', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'Jack', 'have', 'sex', 'wife', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'gotten', 'off', 'thinking', 'Jack', 'acually', 'very', 'clear', 'what', 'strange', 'sexual', 'fantasies', 'were', 'Schiller', 'was', 'too', 'busy', 'telling', 'who', 'had', 'talked', 'think', 'himself.He', 'will', 'tell', 'what', 'BIG', 'star', 'Pace', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'how', 'discovered', 'forgot', 'give', 'acting', 'lessons.So', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'true', 'facts', 'slanted', 'everyones', 'view', 'point', 'SPY']",Master Spy: Robert Hanssen Story
743811,A39SJ6V6QCGC37,B00008K7AU,Midge,"[0, 0]","The actors were quite good in their roles (although Bonnie's character was a bit overboard on tantrums). The movie is quite watchable despite the gratuitous director & writer.As others stated, it is a good companion movie for Breach. There are multiple glaring problems with the direction & writing which I'll describe below but the performance of the actors far outweighs those negative aspects  & is still a good movie, albeit, missing critical detail.If you watch the director's bragging in the extra special features, you will discover he wasted enormous funds on giving himself & his writer paid, tax deductible pleasure trips to Russia, Hong Kong, DC, Hawaii, Canada, NY, Chicago, etc., from which the audience didn't benefit. From the scenes, it could have been filmed in any hotel room or office with a superimposed  photo or video plate in the background.  Too many directors are wasting production money on free, tax deductible trips & other toys using a movie as their excuse.  Yet the audience does not benefit. We see the interior of a hotel room with some recognizable background that easily could have been superimposed. Or a quick view of the Kremlin or some street in Hong Kong that could have been substituted by any stock footages or filmed by one camera person as a background or fill scene rather than paying a full crew for each locale based on the meager scenes we saw.It was clearly a case of self gratification for the director & writer as was their gaining access to the bowels of the FBI HQ, Russia's Politico & prison; the latter 2 of which could have been filmed anywhere from what little we saw.  But for all the bragging by the director on his commentaries about how he gained access to all the key people for their stories & info; it was obviously to satiate his own personal curiosity & acquire personal tours of forbidden areas since the audience didn't benefit from all the info he claimed to have gathered.While the story of Hanssen's strange relationship with his buddy in Germany was better explained in this movie as well as Hanssen's plutonic relationship with a stripper; there was no reason for this director to include 2 full nude stripper show routines except to gratify himself. It certainly did not enhance the movie & only wasted time that should have been used for more detail on the spying & his interaction with the Russians & the investigation of Hanssen. (Which is the main core of Hanssen's notoriety... not the stripper or his buddy)...  although the extremes Hanssen employed to urge his buddy to interact with his wife were quite shocking.The director focused on sex to the point of probably ruining the poor actress's aspects for anything other than porno films. The scenes between Hanssen & Galey could have been just as effective without full, raw strip scenes.  It was clear Hanssen was just wanting someone to talk to & spend time in plutonic companionship who didn't judge him... and was too devoted to his wife & religion to actually cheat. The stripper never had a father figure before who helped her without wanting something in return.More about the incident with the female at work should have been included since we could not ascertain who she was working for and what she was doing on loan & what witnesses said. While it is obvious he was a chauvinist it appeared she was hostile & threw herself on the floor to exacerbate the incident.The worst part of the directing were these scenes where Hanssen was talking to himself in mirrors & windows. The director presumed too much, even with info from Hanssen's therapist. It would have been better if flash scenes of Hanssen with his therapist were inserted instead of those awful mirror talking scenes (even if it was a true depiction). Then there was the corny scene in front of the White house. This is not good directing or good writing despite any prior notoriety. Cheap exhibition.The director ruined the entire ending of the movie with nonsensical babbling. I've never seen a worse ending by any director or writer. I would have been more interested in how Bonnie (with her extreme porn aversion) reacted to learning how she was displayed to his friend & the internet. We should see more about her coping at the end. There was some interaction with the family at the prison, home & church but more could have been included since the director had access to Hanssen's family as he bragged throughout his commentaries & extras.The scenes of his father were quite informative. A few more would have been better.  Hurt didn't quite carry off Hanssen's extreme political, religious & sexual fanaticism as the real Hanssen had foisted upon everyone. But Hurt did give Hanssen a loyal sensibility to his personality which softened the duality of his actions.But the glaring absence of his espionage activities, the interaction with the Russians & the indignities he endured at work were sadly lacking. Yet the director bragged about the inside info he acquired from every source from the FBI to the Russians, to Hanssen`s family & the therapist... but did not share these insights in the film except for the sex related stories of the stripper & his lifelong friend. So you can clearly see where the mind of the director & writer were focused on gratifying themselves recreating Galey's entire strip routines & raw nudity for their personal entertainment. Just watch the directors segment as he brags about his access.The FBI clearly took revenge on Hanssen by publicizing his sexual exploits of Bonnie & relationship with Galey which had nothing to do with spying. Sending Hanssen to Supermax while Aldrich Ames remains in PA was also an extremely cruel act of revenge by the gov't if you ever read about the conditions there which clearly would make anyone psychotic. Far worse than death & certainly inhumane & cruel and was intended for dangerous terrorists & gangsters to prevent them from harming others. They only moved Hanssen to punish & isolate him from his family visits. You should read about the 23 hour solitary confinement, concrete beds, spartan concrete & steel cells, blocked windows, total contact isolation & charging fees for everything imaginable from toothpaste to medical care. Read the Supermax online handbook for the extreme details. Even the former warden calls it a hell.Ironically, the very names of Russian assets Hanssen gave up were doing the exact same thing for the US as Hanssen did in reverse. The Russian assets we recruited were also giving up names of US assets recruited by Russians & providing classified Russian documents to the US by the same means. So our outrage was basically the pot calling the kettle black. The US also obtained the very same type of nuke & military tech info on the Russians from their assets & our agencies were guilty of numerous international law violations like the tunnel under the Russian embassy. The Russians used a window glass prism method in the US Embassy in Russia. Both sides were guilty of the same offenses except the US was much more extreme in recruiting assets & secrets. This is why the spies have no remorse. There was equal damage & violations on both sides.Yet our FBI & CIA agents were paid starvation wages to live in the most expensive cities of the US. It takes over $100,000 in NYC to live at low income levels equal to $20,000 in the grain belt. As much or more for DC, Boston, Chicago, SF or LA. Yet our gov't paid huge fees to foreign assets such as more than $7 million for Hanssen's Ramon files which would never have been needed if the money had gone to better salaries for our agents in the first place working in those high cost cities. Check out the costs of living there.Then they are surprised when these starving, underpaid agents seek a way out of their financial ruin by doing the same as they see the Russian assets paid by our own agencies. Mostly, these were the agents who had demanding wives they couldn't say no to. Perhaps we should pay our agents better & treat them with respect & fire anyone who heckles & ridicules their coworkers. Zero tolerance on abuse & tight access on classified material & less dirty pool against other entities which causes loss of employee respect. Better choice of management & advancement criteria. These seem to be the core problems behind the betrayals. The ridicule & poor wages & hypocrisy with foreign assets are the foundations which foster the creation of these spies. Hanssen was quite brilliant. His methods of drops became a soviet policy used for other assets. If he had been careful with his fingerprints, voice recording & overly chatty tendencies, he would not have been caught. Unlike Ames who was spending money like water, Hanssen was quite careful & wisely kept his identity secret. Keeping bank deposits under $10k was also important since transactions of anything at or above by anyone is always reported immediately by the banking system & would create a red flag.As for Hanssen, Ames & even people like Lanza & Bundy... it was bullying, ridicule & lifelong tormenting by peers & parents which drove them to the actions they took. Some people do not handle torment or abuse well. There should be zero tolerance for any kind of bullying, torment, ridicule, abuse or harassment at school, by kids, parents, coworkers or employers & there would be a lot less big crimes like these. But we even encourage it on blogs & think it is ok to degrade someone for their clothes, intelligence or demeanor at school or work or even at home. It needs to stop or it will get much worse.The movie is still recommended to watch in conjunction with Breach & other info sources despite the rotten ending of Hanssen babbling nonsensically in his cell. Overall, the actors did a great job in spite of the poor direction & poor writing. But the studios really need to get a handle on those directors using funds for self gratification, tax free trips & new toys to take home afterward. They even brag about it. It would save a lot of wasted money to reign in these crooked directors with tougher financial oversight.",3,Good acting.

743813,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B00008K7AU,The Mysterious Traveler,"[4, 11]","MASTER SPY: THE ROBERT HANSSEN STORY( 2003) Directed by Lawrence Schiller. ""Script"" by Norman Mailer.Starring William Hurt, Mary-louise Parker, David Strathairn, Ron Silver and Peter Boyle.Traitor and spy Robert Hanssen was a godsend to the Left and quickly became the Soviet spy they loved to hate. So while Alger Hiss, the Rosenbergs etc etc etc have yet to have single movie about them in nearly 60 years, Hanssen gets two in five.  The reason is plainly obvious. Hanssen was not a communist nor a liberal but rather some wackjob sexual degenerate suppressed homosexual sociopath who happened to be Catholic.So while the film is supposedly about his spying, very little of this over two hour film is actually concerned with espionage. In fact, after the first twenty minutes or so, there is very little plot and the film is content to run mostly in place.  Rather, exactly like with THE SIEGE OF RUBY RIDGE, this is a sleazy liberal hate screed against anything not liberal.  The fraud hack Mailer whose career exists solely because he is an old Sixties era radical leftie uses the Hanssen character as a reverse venom spewer. So dwelling in graphic and extensive detail on Hanssen's degeneracy and basic wackiness with the occasional time out to justify the title, the film then proceeds to attack everything liberals hate.......and they hate so very very much by having Hanssen comment upon it and since he is a sick puppy, the intent is the opposite of what he says.Therefore we learn that Hanssen likes George Bush, dislikes Al Gore, dislikes Gays in the military etc etc etc etc.  No doubt if the film had been made a few years later, Hanssen would say he dislikes socialized medicine and having darkies in the White House. The film's anti-catholicism is virulent and not limited just to Hanssen but also to Parker who plays his wife as some neurotic sex crazed harpy.  The KGB is shown as fighting a noble heroic fight against the ""war mongers"" in Washington aka the Reagan administration and the FBI is portrayed as wasting its time with the Soviet Union since they are ""broke"" and says they should be looking out for low tech primitive threats thus implying that if only the conservatives had stopped fighting communism, 9/11 would never have happened. The grief over the fall of the Soviet Union is palpable.While portraying Hanssen as being some evil conservative papist degenerate gay loon, the film never touches upon why, as the film itself shows, evil conservative Hanssen ONLY did his spying and treason whenever there was a conservative in office. He started under Reagan and stopped in 1991 only to start again once Bush was elected.Not really an espionage film as one learns very little about the espionage. Not really a thriller as Hanssen spies and then gets caught with little effort on anyone's part. Not really a historical film as except for attacks on liberal hate figures and propaganda, there is very little history.  Really just a low grade porn movie with lots of T and A and the aesthetic and maturity of PORKY'S or ILSA QUEEN OF THE SS.William Hurt is very good but again after the 30 minute point, he is on a character treadmill just doing the same character loop over and over.And of course the movie stupidly leaves one with the question if it is bad to have degenerate gays in the FBI then why is it such a nifty idea to have them in the military? Once again the Left's reflexive tendency to smear anyone they hate as being somehow Gay  shoots them in the foot.Ugly vicious piece of trash.Recommended for liberals, socialists, communists and teenage boys going through puberty and who want to see some tail.",1,The disfunction of a seethingly deranged mind.....Norman Mailer,1273708800,"05 13, 2010",2010,3645,"['MASTER', 'SPY', 'ROBERT', 'HANSSEN', 'STORY', '2003', 'Directed', 'Lawrence', 'Schiller', 'Script', 'Norman', 'Mailer.Starring', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Mary-louise', 'Parker', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'Peter', 'Boyle.Traitor', 'spy', 'Robert', 'Hanssen', 'was', 'godsend', 'Left', 'quickly', 'became', 'Soviet', 'spy', 'loved', 'hate', 'So', 'Alger', 'Hiss', 'Rosenbergs', 'etc', 'etc', 'etc', 'have', 'yet', 'have', 'single', 'movie', 'nearly', '60', 'years', 'Hanssen', 'two', 'five', 'reason', 'plainly', 'obvious', 'Hanssen', 'was', 'not', 'communist', 'liberal', 'rather', 'wackjob', 'sexual', 'degenerate', 'suppressed', 'homosexual', 'sociopath', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'Catholic.So', 'film', 'supposedly', 'spying', 'very', 'little', 'two', 'hour', 'film', 'actually', 'concerned', 'espionage', 'fact', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'very', 'little', 'plot', 'film', 'content', 'run', 'mostly', 'place', 'exactly', 'THE', 'SIEGE', 'OF', 'RUBY', 'RIDGE', 'sleazy', 'liberal', 'hate', 'screed', 'anything', 'not', 'liberal', 'fraud', 'hack', 'Mailer', 'career', 'solely', 'old', 'Sixties', 'era', 'radical', 'leftie', 'Hanssen', 'character', 'reverse', 'venom', 'spewer', 'So', 'dwelling', 'graphic', 'extensive', 'detail', 'Hanssen', 'degeneracy', 'basic', 'wackiness', 'occasional', 'time', 'justify', 'title', 'film', 'then', 'attack', 'everything', 'liberals', 'hate', '.and', 'hate', 'so', 'very', 'very', 'much', 'having', 'Hanssen', 'comment', 'sick', 'puppy', 'intent', 'opposite', 'what', 'says.Therefore', 'learn', 'Hanssen', 'likes', 'George', 'Bush', 'Al', 'Gore', 'Gays', 'military', 'etc', 'etc', 'etc', 'etc', 'doubt', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'Hanssen', 'would', 'say', 'socialized', 'medicine', 'having', 'darkies', 'White', 'House', 'film', 'anti-catholicism', 'virulent', 'not', 'limited', 'just', 'Hanssen', 'also', 'Parker', 'who', 'wife', 'neurotic', 'sex', 'crazed', 'harpy', 'KGB', 'shown', 'fighting', 'noble', 'heroic', 'fight', 'war', 'mongers', 'Washington', 'Reagan', 'administration', 'FBI', 'portrayed', 'wasting', 'time', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'are', 'broke', 'should', 'be', 'looking', 'out', 'low', 'tech', 'primitive', 'threats', 'thus', 'implying', 'only', 'conservatives', 'had', 'stopped', 'fighting', 'communism', '9/11', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'happened', 'grief', 'fall', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'palpable.While', 'portraying', 'Hanssen', 'being', 'evil', 'conservative', 'papist', 'degenerate', 'gay', 'loon', 'film', 'never', 'why', 'film', 'evil', 'conservative', 'Hanssen', 'ONLY', 'did', 'spying', 'treason', 'whenever', 'was', 'conservative', 'office', 'started', 'Reagan', 'stopped', '1991', 'only', 'start', 'again', 'once', 'Bush', 'was', 'elected.Not', 'really', 'espionage', 'film', 'one', 'very', 'little', 'espionage', 'Not', 'really', 'thriller', 'Hanssen', 'spies', 'then', 'caught', 'little', 'effort', 'anyone', 'part', 'Not', 'really', 'historical', 'film', 'attacks', 'liberal', 'hate', 'figures', 'propaganda', 'very', 'little', 'history', 'Really', 'just', 'low', 'grade', 'porn', 'movie', 'lots', 'T', 'A', 'aesthetic', 'maturity', 'PORKY', 'ILSA', 'QUEEN', 'THE', 'SS.William', 'Hurt', 'very', 'good', 'again', '30', 'minute', 'point', 'character', 'treadmill', 'just', 'doing', 'same', 'character', 'loop', 'over.And', 'course', 'movie', 'stupidly', 'one', 'question', 'bad', 'have', 'degenerate', 'gays', 'FBI', 'then', 'why', 'such', 'nifty', 'idea', 'have', 'military', 'Once', 'again', 'Left', 'reflexive', 'tendency', 'smear', 'anyone', 'hate', 'being', 'somehow', 'Gay', 'shoots', 'foot.Ugly', 'vicious', 'piece', 'trash.Recommended', 'liberals', 'socialists', 'communists', 'teenage', 'boys', 'going', 'puberty', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'tail']",Master Spy: Robert Hanssen Story
