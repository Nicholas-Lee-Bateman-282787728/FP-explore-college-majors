1156001,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B00177Y9ZC,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[10, 15]","`Jumper' could be the perfect manipulative teen movie fantasy.  Start with a boy who  faces a distant, but menacing father in a divorced family where the mother's been absent since his fifth birthday, a bully at school who keeps him from his dream girl, and we have all the makings of an escapist venue about someone who gets and tries to keep it all.In an early confrontation, David Rice (Hayden Christensen) meets school bully Mike as he connects with Mike's girlfriend, Millie Harris (Rachel Bilser).  He's sharing a glass bubble snow scene with her when Mike confiscates it and throws it on a frozen river.  Predictably, David falls through the ice while retrieving it, and remarkably, Millie's rescue attempts don't have her joining him through the same ice; even more mysterious is how Dave gets transported to the local Ann Arbor Library before he can suffocate under a sheet of unbroken ice.Now he's discovered magical powers that enable him to jump ahead short and long distances in hyper-cyber leaps with invisible traces.  If he can only hone it and use it at will, he can globe trot the world and use it at whim.  We not only go forward physically, but we do so in time frames as well with casual announcements of passing time.  (The movie does this--not the powers.)  Relationships would surely suffer, but not for him.  We see him elude his overbearing father, but his trek seems like a lonely one with no one he can share his gift.His first act is to do mission impossible and rob an impenetrable bank.  In one of the movie's time warps, we leap ahead to David sitting in his upscale New York apartment.  Never mind that this kid who wouldn't have the credit history or employment record to justify his application.  Having forgotten Millie for some years, he's able to pick up a girl at a London pub just after hanging out on one of the four faces of Big Ben.  After enough fooling around, he decides he's grown lonesome for Millie, so he heads (I should say jumps) back to Ann Arbor years later where he finds she's supporting her college expenses as a bar maid.  Here he also meets a drunken Mike where the conversation turns as tipsy as his beer glass.  Again enamored by the contrast of brutish Mike to his civility and maybe a little more than impressed by David's ability to throttle his nemesis through powerful transport, Millie is his.  Not wanting to be peculiar in her eyes, David satisfies her desire to travel the world, using traditional money instead of his magical powers.There has to be a catch.  After the bank robbery, NSA operative, Roland (Samuel L. Jackson) is hot on his trail and knowledgeable about the Jumpers.  Using an electrical device, Roland is able to stave off jumping powers by shocking the Jumper's brain waves.  Not able to transport, he nevertheless, uses photographs to unlock the path of his suspects' movements.  Labeled an Inquisition figure, Roland roars, ""Only God should have the power to be all places at all times.""  So instead of an investigative interest in the bank robbery, we get a jealous preacher.  If there's no consolation in the chase, then we're at least better informed when David locks heads with British fellow jumper, Griffin (Jamie Bell).In many ways the movie goes nowhere.  The scenes where he moves ahead are done with genuine expressions by the actors, but the special effects draw attention to itself.  It's much more satisfying to watch the believable blur in a 'Bourne' movie.  The transport gets tiresome at times.  Credibility also takes a back seat.  Maybe he can jump to Maui, but does it automatically make him a champion surfer?  There are no good guys here (except for one sweet and innocent girl).  That may work for 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,' but not here.  Robbing a bank doesn't make our protagonist likable or gain our sympathies.  Without intending to do so, the film highlights much of sixties' science fiction which looked upon such advancements with a wary eye and undermined them with consequences.  (Okay, so this is more fantasy than anything else, but it's the same idea.)  I did like the mystery of David's mother (Diane Lane), but even that treatment is limited.  If you want a real vehicle for the imagination, read Philip Jose' Farmers' `To Your Scattered Bodies Go (Riverworld Saga, Book 1),' a truly transporting work--one that expertly fuses space and time with the necessary caveats in ways this movie does not.(Based on a novelJumper: A Novel (Jumper)by Steven Gould.)",2,Displaced Person,1215734400,"07 11, 2008",2008,4493,"['Jumper', 'could', 'be', 'perfect', 'manipulative', 'teen', 'movie', 'fantasy', 'Start', 'boy', 'who', 'distant', 'menacing', 'father', 'divorced', 'family', 'where', 'mother', 'been', 'absent', 'fifth', 'birthday', 'bully', 'school', 'who', 'dream', 'girl', 'have', 'makings', 'escapist', 'venue', 'someone', 'who', 'tries', 'keep', 'all.In', 'early', 'confrontation', 'David', 'Rice', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'school', 'bully', 'Mike', 'Mike', 'girlfriend', 'Millie', 'Harris', 'Rachel', 'Bilser', 'sharing', 'glass', 'bubble', 'snow', 'scene', 'when', 'Mike', 'frozen', 'river', 'Predictably', 'David', 'ice', 'retrieving', 'remarkably', 'Millie', 'rescue', 'attempts', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'joining', 'same', 'ice', 'even', 'more', 'mysterious', 'how', 'Dave', 'transported', 'local', 'Ann', 'Arbor', 'Library', 'can', 'suffocate', 'sheet', 'unbroken', 'ice.Now', 'discovered', 'magical', 'powers', 'enable', 'jump', 'ahead', 'short', 'long', 'distances', 'hyper-cyber', 'leaps', 'invisible', 'traces', 'can', 'only', 'hone', 'use', 'will', 'can', 'globe', 'trot', 'world', 'use', 'whim', 'not', 'only', 'go', 'forward', 'physically', 'do', 'so', 'time', 'frames', 'as', 'well', 'casual', 'announcements', 'passing', 'time', 'movie', 'not', 'powers', 'Relationships', 'would', 'surely', 'suffer', 'not', 'see', 'elude', 'overbearing', 'father', 'trek', 'lonely', 'one', 'one', 'can', 'share', 'gift.His', 'first', 'act', 'do', 'mission', 'impossible', 'rob', 'impenetrable', 'bank', 'one', 'movie', 'time', 'warps', 'leap', 'ahead', 'David', 'sitting', 'upscale', 'New', 'York', 'apartment', 'mind', 'kid', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'credit', 'history', 'employment', 'record', 'justify', 'application', 'Having', 'forgotten', 'Millie', 'years', 'able', 'pick', 'up', 'girl', 'London', 'pub', 'just', 'hanging', 'out', 'one', 'four', 'Big', 'Ben', 'enough', 'fooling', 'around', 'grown', 'lonesome', 'Millie', 'should', 'say', 'jumps', 'back', 'Ann', 'Arbor', 'years', 'later', 'where', 'supporting', 'college', 'expenses', 'bar', 'maid', 'Here', 'also', 'drunken', 'Mike', 'where', 'conversation', 'as', 'tipsy', 'beer', 'glass', 'Again', 'enamored', 'contrast', 'brutish', 'Mike', 'civility', 'maybe', 'little', 'more', 'impressed', 'David', 'ability', 'throttle', 'nemesis', 'powerful', 'transport', 'Millie', 'Not', 'wanting', 'be', 'peculiar', 'eyes', 'David', 'desire', 'travel', 'world', 'using', 'traditional', 'money', 'instead', 'magical', 'powers.There', 'be', 'catch', 'bank', 'robbery', 'NSA', 'operative', 'Roland', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'hot', 'trail', 'knowledgeable', 'Jumpers', 'Using', 'electrical', 'device', 'Roland', 'able', 'stave', 'off', 'jumping', 'powers', 'shocking', 'Jumper', 'brain', 'waves', 'Not', 'able', 'transport', 'nevertheless', 'photographs', 'unlock', 'path', 'suspects', 'movements', 'Labeled', 'Inquisition', 'figure', 'Roland', 'Only', 'God', 'should', 'have', 'power', 'be', 'places', 'times', 'instead', 'investigative', 'interest', 'bank', 'robbery', 'get', 'jealous', 'preacher', 'consolation', 'chase', 'then', ""'re"", 'least', 'better', 'informed', 'when', 'David', 'heads', 'British', 'fellow', 'jumper', 'Griffin', 'Jamie', 'Bell', '.In', 'many', 'ways', 'movie', 'nowhere', 'scenes', 'where', 'ahead', 'are', 'done', 'genuine', 'expressions', 'actors', 'special', 'effects', 'draw', 'attention', 'much', 'more', 'satisfying', 'watch', 'believable', 'blur', ""'Bourne"", 'movie', 'transport', 'tiresome', 'times', 'Credibility', 'also', 'back', 'seat', 'Maybe', 'can', 'jump', 'Maui', 'automatically', 'make', 'champion', 'surfer', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'here', 'one', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'girl', 'may', 'work', ""'Butch"", 'Cassidy', 'Sundance', 'Kid', 'not', 'here', 'Robbing', 'bank', ""n't"", 'make', 'protagonist', 'likable', 'gain', 'sympathies', 'intending', 'do', 'so', 'film', 'highlights', 'much', 'sixties', 'science', 'fiction', 'looked', 'such', 'advancements', 'wary', 'eye', 'undermined', 'consequences', 'Okay', 'more', 'fantasy', 'anything', 'else', 'same', 'idea', 'did', 'mystery', 'David', 'mother', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'even', 'treatment', 'limited', 'want', 'real', 'vehicle', 'imagination', 'read', 'Philip', 'Jose', 'Farmers', 'Your', 'Scattered', 'Bodies', 'Go', 'Riverworld', 'Saga', 'Book', '1', 'truly', 'transporting', 'work', 'one', 'expertly', 'space', 'time', 'necessary', 'caveats', 'ways', 'movie', 'not', 'Based', 'novelJumper', 'Novel', 'Jumper', 'Steven', 'Gould']",Jumper

And I felt he gave a good, strong effort in Star Wars trilogy.  But I just feel he's not the appropriate actor for the lead role of David Rice, the jumper whom the movie revolves around.  The guy discovers his jumping ability as a teenager, and runs away from home, leading to an easy life of crime.  After setting up this background, the movie picks up on David eight years later.If you pause and think about it, the character David Rice is an immature, small time crook who could basically go anywhere he wants to.  It's okay for him to steal to finance a lavish lifestyle, because he has that one-in-a-billion god-given talent to do it.  Life is easy for David Rice.  And I just think Christensen plays the David Rice role a bit too straight and narrow.  Rice is crafty, beguiling, the big easy, and Christensen does not role play Rice in that way.

The movie could have easily been at least 100 to 110 minutes long. Hayden Christensen is alright in the role as David Rice. Samuel L Jackson though is amazing in the role as Roland and this part could have been given more background and time. The special effects are nothing special. If this movie had been done in the 90's it would be amazing but having been done 2008 I have this before and better.

I really liked the movie when I first saw it, but I love it even more now.  I've got it on my Top 200 Movie list.  It's one of the few films of the last decade that I can honestly say I wish was quite a bit longer.  It's only 88 minutes and it just flies through those few minutes leaving you wanting more...hence Jumper 2 which is in development now.  Another 30 minutes could easily be added to this flick.  The story is simply so intriguing that I felt that more back story and character development could have been included.  But I also appreciate that director Doug Liman gave us a great short film that never seems to have any dead spots for bathroom breaks.  Liman really changed action movie making IMO with The Bourne Identity (2002), which absolutely blew me away when I saw it on DVD.  It still blows me away at how good that movie is when I see it now.  Liman really crafted a new standard for the thinking man's action movie with The Bourne Identity and then Jumper.  Director Paul Greengrass amazingly took Liman's model and made it even better in the Bourne sequels The Bourne Supremacy (2004) and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007).Back to Jumper...the story is a combination of sci-fi, action and drama.  The blend is perfect because it all seems so believable within the framework of the movie.  It's probably good that Liman doesn't get into explaining how the teleporting is possible, because that might just take away from the story.  Actors Hayden Christensen and Jamie Bell seem perfectly suited to their characters, as does Samuel Jackson as the ""bad guy"".  Even Rachel Bilson as the love interest in the film is good casting, in sharp contrast to the eye candy status of Megan Fox in Transformers (2007).  Don't get me wrong, Megan Fox is gorgeous looking in Transformers...but that's about it.  Whereas Rachel Bilson is gorgeous looking in Jumper, but she's also a talented actor and shows it in this film.Of course part of what always makes a good action/drama flick is the filming on location.  And Jumper impresses on that level as well.  The cinematography is brilliant and amazingly Liman got limited access to film in the actual Colosseum in Rome...a rare feat for filmmakers.  The Colosseum scenes are impressive for their beauty.  Apparently they had to film those scenes using only natural light since Colosseum Officials wouldn't allow them to set-up equipment on the ground.  So the shots are all handheld with natural light.Bottom line is that Jumper is a great film.",4,Wish It Was Longer,1286236800,"10 5, 2010",2010,2629,"['watched', 'Jumper', '2008', 'second', 'time', 'week', 'having', 'seen', 'first', 'time', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'year', 'two', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'love', 'even', 'more', 'now', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Top', '200', 'Movie', 'list', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'last', 'decade', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'wish', 'was', 'quite', 'bit', 'longer', 'only', '88', 'minutes', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', 'leaving', 'wanting', 'more', 'hence', 'Jumper', '2', 'development', 'now', '30', 'minutes', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'added', 'flick', 'story', 'simply', 'so', 'intriguing', 'felt', 'more', 'back', 'story', 'character', 'development', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'also', 'appreciate', 'director', 'Doug', 'Liman', 'gave', 'great', 'short', 'film', 'never', 'have', 'dead', 'spots', 'bathroom', 'breaks', 'Liman', 'really', 'changed', 'action', 'movie', 'making', 'IMO', 'Bourne', 'Identity', '2002', 'absolutely', 'blew', 'away', 'when', 'saw', 'DVD', 'still', 'away', 'how', 'good', 'movie', 'when', 'see', 'now', 'Liman', 'really', 'crafted', 'new', 'standard', 'thinking', 'man', 'action', 'movie', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'then', 'Jumper', 'Director', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'amazingly', 'took', 'Liman', 'model', 'made', 'even', 'better', 'Bourne', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', '2004', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', '2007', '.Back', 'Jumper', 'story', 'combination', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'drama', 'blend', 'perfect', 'so', 'believable', 'framework', 'movie', 'probably', 'good', 'Liman', ""n't"", 'get', 'explaining', 'how', 'teleporting', 'possible', 'might', 'just', 'take', 'away', 'story', 'Actors', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'seem', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'characters', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'bad', 'guy', 'Even', 'Rachel', 'Bilson', 'love', 'interest', 'film', 'good', 'casting', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'eye', 'candy', 'status', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'Transformers', '2007', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'gorgeous', 'looking', 'Transformers', 'Whereas', 'Rachel', 'Bilson', 'gorgeous', 'looking', 'Jumper', 'also', 'talented', 'actor', 'film.Of', 'course', 'part', 'what', 'always', 'good', 'action/drama', 'flick', 'filming', 'location', 'Jumper', 'level', 'as', 'well', 'cinematography', 'brilliant', 'amazingly', 'Liman', 'got', 'limited', 'access', 'film', 'actual', 'Colosseum', 'Rome', 'rare', 'feat', 'filmmakers', 'Colosseum', 'scenes', 'are', 'impressive', 'beauty', 'Apparently', 'had', 'film', 'scenes', 'using', 'only', 'natural', 'light', 'Colosseum', 'Officials', 'would', ""n't"", 'allow', 'set-up', 'equipment', 'ground', 'shots', 'are', 'handheld', 'natural', 'light.Bottom', 'line', 'Jumper', 'great', 'film']",Jumper

However I did actually enjoy this movie. It gets going pretty fast and keeps this pace through out the whole movie and at 88 minutes long its just the right length as to not get stale. Hayden Christensen plays David Rice who has the ability to Jump, Jumping in this movie is an ability some have that allows them to teleport to anywhere they have been before instantly. After learning of this ability David runs away from home and his alcoholic father to New York, where he robs a bank. David is living a wonderful life and all seems well until Samuel L. Jackson's character Roland Cox who is a member of a secret organization that hunts down and kills Jumpers known as The Paladins catches up with him. The rest of the movie is a globe trotting action extravagnaza as David must protect his childhood sweet heart from this vicious hunter, and teams up with an unstable Jumper Griffin played by jamie Bell.So all in all this movie was worth the rental, and I would encourage anyone who has not seen it to check it out. Christensen does a much better job in this movie than his boring performance in StarWars(although his evil scenes in StarWars were good), and the special effects, locations, and action sequences were pretty cool as well.

Wrong movie. Sorry `bout that. Well not truly sorry; just a tad peeved at this flick and how horribly it went astray.It is true, however, that the grim Hayden Christiansen of the newStar Warsfame is the main character (David Rice), and he has some unique abilities: he can jump through space/time at will, breakfasting on top of the Sphinx in Egypt, jumping back to his New York flat for luncheon pizza, then heading out to surf in Hawaii that same day ...or even hour if he wished it. He learns he has this power during his high school years (the young David is played by Max Thieriot - seeThe Astronaut Farmer) and nearly dies after falling through some thin river ice. He miraculously reappears in a local library, water and all, soaking book stacks. David was trying to retrieve a gift from the ice that he'd gotten for a girl he liked named Millie (Rachel Bilson), but he quickly learns that his jumping abilities make him something of a freak, and believes Millie would see him that way too. So he runs away and into the world.Once out amongst the populace he learns how to steal, including jumping into bank vaults and taking as much money as he will. But this also gains him notice by a secret society of men known as Paladins (look up Palatine and you'll find interesting parallels). The head of this religious order is a man named Roland (Samuel L. Jackson,Snakes on a Plane), and his goal is to kill Jumpers (""No one but God should have these powers!"")So the battle between Jumper and Paladin is set and interesting shots and gadgets dot the screen. And that's about it...The biggest flaw with the film is that there's no set-up to it. We don't really know why Jumpers can do what they do (Genetic/X-Men-like mutation? Alien DNA? Gods?). We also don't know who funds the Paladins with all of their travel, gadgets, and many, many members. I can guess that it might have been the Roman Catholic Church, but it's never even hinted at. If it was the church, then how did Roland get access to secret information, including bank vaults, police records, etc.?With all of its story flaws, Jumpers does have some amazing CGI. Particularly, there was one scene where Roland is in the desert and a Jumper brings a double-decker London bus with him through a jump scar and tries to roll it on top of Roland. That was incredible and made my jaw drop.But that was it. All style over any substance, Jumper was so weak along storylines that I didn't much care what happened to anyone in the film. The worst part is that the ending was obviously set up for a sequel. Maybe Mace Windu (Jackson's Star Wars character) could magically appear and wield 'The Force' to kill that off, too.",2,Anakin Skywalker Jumps ...And Falls,1220486400,"09 4, 2008",2008,2790,"['***CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS***Anakin', 'Skywalker', 'forces', 'evil', 'using', 'force', 'Oh', 'Wait', 'minute', 'Wrong', 'movie', 'Sorry', 'bout', 'Well', 'not', 'truly', 'sorry', 'just', 'tad', 'peeved', 'flick', 'how', 'horribly', 'went', 'astray.It', 'true', 'however', 'grim', 'Hayden', 'Christiansen', 'newStar', 'Warsfame', 'main', 'character', 'David', 'Rice', 'unique', 'abilities', 'can', 'jump', 'space/time', 'will', 'breakfasting', 'top', 'Sphinx', 'Egypt', 'jumping', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'flat', 'luncheon', 'pizza', 'then', 'heading', 'out', 'surf', 'Hawaii', 'same', 'day', 'even', 'hour', 'wished', 'power', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'young', 'David', 'played', 'Max', 'Thieriot', 'seeThe', 'Astronaut', 'Farmer', 'nearly', 'dies', 'falling', 'thin', 'river', 'ice', 'miraculously', 'local', 'library', 'water', 'soaking', 'book', 'stacks', 'David', 'was', 'trying', 'retrieve', 'gift', 'ice', ""'d"", 'gotten', 'girl', 'liked', 'named', 'Millie', 'Rachel', 'Bilson', 'quickly', 'jumping', 'abilities', 'make', 'something', 'freak', 'Millie', 'would', 'see', 'way', 'too', 'away', 'world.Once', 'populace', 'how', 'steal', 'including', 'jumping', 'bank', 'vaults', 'taking', 'as', 'much', 'money', 'will', 'also', 'gains', 'notice', 'secret', 'society', 'men', 'known', 'Paladins', 'look', 'up', 'Palatine', ""'ll"", 'find', 'interesting', 'parallels', 'head', 'religious', 'order', 'man', 'named', 'Roland', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Snakes', 'Plane', 'goal', 'kill', 'Jumpers', 'one', 'God', 'should', 'have', 'powers', 'battle', 'Jumper', 'Paladin', 'set', 'interesting', 'shots', 'gadgets', 'dot', 'screen', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'film', 'set-up', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'why', 'Jumpers', 'can', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'Genetic/X-Men-like', 'mutation', 'Alien', 'DNA', 'Gods', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'funds', 'Paladins', 'travel', 'gadgets', 'many', 'many', 'members', 'can', 'guess', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'never', 'even', 'hinted', 'was', 'church', 'then', 'how', 'did', 'Roland', 'get', 'access', 'secret', 'information', 'including', 'bank', 'vaults', 'police', 'records', 'etc', 'story', 'flaws', 'Jumpers', 'have', 'amazing', 'CGI', 'Particularly', 'was', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Roland', 'desert', 'Jumper', 'double-decker', 'London', 'bus', 'jump', 'scar', 'tries', 'roll', 'top', 'Roland', 'was', 'incredible', 'made', 'jaw', 'drop.But', 'was', 'style', 'substance', 'Jumper', 'was', 'so', 'weak', 'storylines', 'did', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'what', 'happened', 'anyone', 'film', 'worst', 'part', 'ending', 'was', 'obviously', 'set', 'up', 'sequel', 'Maybe', 'Mace', 'Windu', 'Jackson', 'Star', 'Wars', 'character', 'could', 'magically', 'appear', 'wield', ""'The"", 'Force', 'kill', 'off', 'too']",Jumper

Erland,"[2, 3]","Synopsis: The film grabbed my attention immediately as it opened with a young man standing atop the Sphinx with the pyramids in the background, for me it doesn't get any better than that. The first words you hear are ""Let me tell you about my day so far"" spoken by David Rice (Hayden Christensen), former average guy turned Jumper. And what's a jumper you ask, why it's a person who can instantaneously teleport themselves to anyplace in the world. They're here one second, gone the next.David misuses his power as one might expect, like a kid in a candy shop he pops in and out of bank vaults with loads of money and begins to live the life of luxury beyond one's wildest dreams. That is until he encounters Griffin (Jamie Bell) another more experienced jumper who instructs David in the dangers of being ""different"" from others. He learns that jumpers are pursued by a group known as the Palladin, a sophisticated, zealous group that believes jumpers are an abomination and dedicated to hunting down and kills them as though it were some type of holy crusade.The action gets fast and furious as David and Griffin teleport around the globe with the Palladin in hot pursuit. When David's girlfriend Millie (Rachel Bilson) becomes Palladin bait to draw the two out in the open Griffin's words ring truer than ever, ""Welcome to the war!""Critique: The '08 film `Jumper' is a slick but not too original story that borrow heavily from the cult classic `Higlander' with a little `Matrix' thrown in to draw the attention of the sci-fi fans. While the special effects are quite good the storyline just doesn't seem to capture the imagination as the other two above mentioned films, the soundtrack is rather weak and uninspiring and Hayden Christensen is rather lackluster and unconvincing. What saved the film for me was the presence of fellow jumper Griffin as played by Jamie Bell.

Well luckily, I was able to make it through the film without being devoured along the way.You know the synopsis, so I won't bore you with those details.  And you know that this is a high-concept thingamajig, so I won't give you that one-liner that somehow drew some producer in to greenlighting this project.  OK; so I lied.  ""Well, there's this dude who has some genetic anomaly that allows him to 'jump' from place to place!""  ""Wow, that's a really cool idea.  I like it!  Get me the script!""I did have a problem or two with this movie, of course.  First of all, how was it that Hayden Christensen was able to ""jump"" from place to place, but never seemed to end up in, say, the middle of a wall?  He always seemed to land in the middle of the room.  If he hadn't been somewhere before, that seemed impossible to me as he wouldn't know where to ""land.""  Furthermore, this guy was supposed to have some genetic predisposition to being able to ""jump.""  Now, that's all well and good -- although they don't really explain that genetic anomaly in the film, they just wave their hands about it all -- but how did he, and other ""jumpers"" then move other objects as well?  How did they even ""jump"" their clothes?  I mean, after all, I'm assuming that clothes don't really have DNA (well, the cotton is dead if it does).  Jumpers should have arrived at their destinations, well, naked.But I did somewhat like the love interest here; I often complain about films having a love interest strictly because Hollywood, and Americans, mistakenly believe that you always need one.  It did allow the filmmaker to use the old-and-trusted dramatic irony here and there; we knew that Mr. Christensen could ""jump"" but his gal-pal didn't.  (Potential spoiler.)  And a nice little cameo by Kristen Stewart at the end gave me a very good chuckle.

That's because they are focused towards action and fun which the Academy usually frowns upon. With the exception of ""Lord of the Rings"" how often have you seen them give it to fun movies? Afterall ""Star Wars"" or ""Anger Management"" certainly weren't about to get one. So don't expect ""Jumpers"" to be anything more than it is, a fun action movie. Now I grant you I have a couple questions. Did his father survive? Who funded the Paladins? Where they really working for NSA? Why did his mother have a kid if jumping is genetic? If Paladins can jump, aren't they a jumper too? Okay I had more than a couple questions not being answered, but overall I liked the ride.Some will say robbing banks or Paladins killing innocent people is setting a bad precedent for kids to watch. I agree. Have you thrown out your families ""Grand Theft Auto IV"" yet? Yeah right, so let's not be so judgemental on this movie. The main character is none other than Hayden Christensen of Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader fame. He does a decent job playing the part of a Jumper. Samuel Jackson unfortunately doesn't really get much opportunity to show his ability acting as one of the bloodthirsty Paladins. Worse yet, we barely see the lovely and talented Diane Lane.The movie starts us with a boy saving his own life, by jumping to a library he knew as a child, when he falls in a icy lake. As the story evolves we find out Jumpers typically start jumping at age five. For some unknown reason we find that Paladins since medieval times have killed jumpers. Sorry this is one premise I couldn't accept. Paladins have always been portrayed as good and guarding religious people from harm. Convincing me this means they would kill people for jumping into a bank and robbing  it is stretching it thin. They would have been better off to just make the government in pursuit of them, specifically Homeland Security or NSA. Even then it would need to be if captured a Jumper would face imprisonment not death if they were guilty of lesser than capital crimes. Now that I got that out of my system, I still like the movie for the most part. The story wasn't bad, the acting decent, and the effects great. Not a bad Summer movie at all.

Moments of this film are so obviously ridiculous that it's difficult to imagine their inclusions as unintentional. Consider the fact that Hayden Christensen's character--who has the ability to teleport himself to wherever he wants--literally ends up atop famous landmarks, such as the face of Big Ben, or the head of the Sphinx; honestly, doesn't this seem like an inside joke on the filmmaker's part? But after a while, I had to admit to myself that it wasn't supposed to be campy and that I wasn't having fun. This movie is just plain frustrating, not only because it fails to tell a coherent story, but also because it assumes we'll understand it even though it doesn't explain itself. Watching ""Jumper"" is like playing a video game without knowing the rules, what the goal is, or even how to use the controller.The science fiction element is probably the most frustrating thing of all, simply because it's an intriguing concept that has nothing to fall back on. It can't even rely on the plot, which can't be described without falling through one of its numerous holes. Example: the prologue establishes that small-town Detroit boy David Rice discovered the power to transport himself at age fifteen (Max Thieriot), when he ended up in a library after walking on a frozen lake and falling through some thin ice. But wait a minute--as an adult (Christensen) in the story proper, he's informed that he first transported at age five. If that's true, then I have a hard time believing he'd forget something like that for ten straight years.Never mind; what is clear is that David's power--called Jumping--can take him across any distance, from a few feet to a few thousand miles. And indeed, he Jumps all over the world on any given day, using only a postcard or a mental image to get him to his destination (and that makes we wonder about the moment he saved himself from drowning at age fifteen, since I can't imagine him visualizing a library). Oh, and in case you're wonder how David supports himself, it should be noted here that he's a very rich young man, living in one of New York City's most expensive areas. He's never been a hard worker, but he can steal money by jumping to and from sealed bank vaults. He eventually uses that money to take his high school sweetheart--Millie (Rachel Bilson)--on a trip to Rome. He, of course, doesn't Jump there, since that would be telling her too much too soon. But considering how annoying and unbelievable she is, I don't think it would have mattered a great deal.We're soon introduced to a man named Roland (Samuel L. Jackson), and that's when the story really gets confusing. Roland, you see, is the leader of the Paladins, a group dedicated to hunting down and destroying every last Jumper on earth. As for why Roland does this, all he ever says is, ""Only God should have the power to be in all places at once."" He also says that, sooner or later, all Jumpers turn bad. What he doesn't say is why or how, nor does he even hint at a Paladin back-story, such as how long they've been chasing Jumpers and why they feel so threatened by them. That would have been helpful, don't you think? Roland shows his angry side by shocking Jumpers with metal rods that shoot out electrified wires; this wouldn't have been a problem had the film actually attempted to explain what these weapons were.David soon learns that he's not the only Jumper. Here enters Griffin (Jamie Bell), an antisocial hothead who hunts Paladins from his shack in the middle of one of the world's deserts. He says that he's been tracking David for the past ten years, which is difficult to understand since he looks about as old as David does, maybe even younger. He also says that he lost his parents when he was only five, and this was because the Paladins discovered his ability to Jump. Again, I ask why. And again, I say never mind, because I haven't even gotten to the final major sequence, which sees Millie trapped in Roland's clutches, awaiting David to return from a showdown with Griffin.Have I made it clear just how infuriating this movie is? Probably not--this review is just as rambling and confused as the film itself. ""Jumper"" is all action but no setup, a cool-looking science fiction thriller that tells us nothing but expects us to be entertained nonetheless. My biggest beef related to David's back story, a classic case of feeling unloved and unwanted; when he was only five, his mother (Diane Lane) left him and his abusive, alcoholic father (Michael Rooker), so by the time he turned fifteen, he had had enough rejection in his life. I won't reveal why his mother left, although I will say that her reasons only added more questions to an ever-growing list. This movie can do nothing more than raise questions, which makes me wonder if director Doug Liman intentionally left the explanations out of the final cut. Here's hoping that fixing this film is as simple as releasing an exhaustively re-cut extended version; it might be something I can watch without feeling so damn lost.",2,It's No Jump in the

I actually never intended to see it but for reasons I won't go into I found it at RedBox and gave it a chance. And I liked it. it wasn't perfect - not remotely - but it has a certain charm probably because of it's unrealized potential. It could have been great but fell just short. I see a few reasons for this but the main being 1) it was only about 90 minutes long. They should have given it that extra 30 minutes, turned it into a 2 hour movie and tied up a few loose ends and take us into reason number 2) character development. You want the relationship between David and Millie but you don't buy it as much as you should because it wasn't developed properly. Also, they attempted to make David not a bad guy - and I guess over all he wasn't - but they could have done better. The notes he left at the bank (which I missed upon first viewing due to the disk skipping) hinted that he was a guy with a conscience, and he never actually killed anyone like Griffin so that earns him brownie points as well, but they could have done better and showing just how ""different"" he was in regards to Roland's expectations of him. Now an extra 30 minutes to develop the story wouldn't have have perfected it. There were other scenes throughout that could have helped develop it as well but the extra time would have helped in some way. I know they mentioned possible sequels if it did well enough. The thing about leaving room for sequels is that while you may want to leave some questions unanswered to be answered in the sequel you can't leave EVERYTHING unanswered and I think this first attempt left a lot of things hanging, more than they should have. Still, despite these failings, I did enjoy and buy it. It's a fun movie and being a sci-fi/action/romance person, this fit my bill despite the weak presentation of plot. However I was grateful to the warning about the 2 disk edition since I've already got an iTunes copy. I'd hate to spend even more money just to double or triple what I've already got but not really come out ahead.",3,"Low Expectations, High Return",1221436800,"09 15, 2008",2008,2096,"['so', 'many', 'others', 'went', 'not', 'expecting', 'like', 'actually', 'never', 'intended', 'see', 'reasons', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'found', 'RedBox', 'gave', 'chance', 'liked', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'not', 'remotely', 'certain', 'charm', 'probably', 'unrealized', 'potential', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'fell', 'just', 'short', 'see', 'few', 'reasons', 'main', 'being', '1', 'was', 'only', 'about', '90', 'minutes', 'long', 'should', 'have', 'given', '30', 'minutes', 'turned', '2', 'hour', 'movie', 'tied', 'up', 'few', 'loose', 'ends', 'take', 'reason', 'number', '2', 'character', 'development', 'want', 'relationship', 'David', 'Millie', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'because', 'was', ""n't"", 'developed', 'properly', 'Also', 'attempted', 'make', 'David', 'not', 'bad', 'guy', 'guess', 'was', ""n't"", 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'notes', 'left', 'bank', 'missed', 'first', 'viewing', 'due', 'disk', 'skipping', 'hinted', 'was', 'guy', 'conscience', 'never', 'actually', 'killed', 'anyone', 'Griffin', 'brownie', 'points', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'showing', 'just', 'how', 'different', 'was', 'regards', 'Roland', 'expectations', 'Now', 'extra', '30', 'minutes', 'develop', 'story', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'have', 'perfected', 'were', 'other', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'helped', 'develop', 'as', 'well', 'extra', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'way', 'know', 'mentioned', 'possible', 'sequels', 'did', 'well', 'enough', 'thing', 'leaving', 'room', 'sequels', 'may', 'want', 'leave', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'be', 'answered', 'sequel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'EVERYTHING', 'unanswered', 'think', 'first', 'attempt', 'left', 'lot', 'things', 'hanging', 'more', 'should', 'have', 'Still', 'failings', 'did', 'enjoy', 'buy', 'fun', 'movie', 'being', 'sci-fi/action/romance', 'person', 'fit', 'bill', 'weak', 'presentation', 'plot', 'However', 'was', 'grateful', 'warning', '2', 'disk', 'edition', ""'ve"", 'already', 'got', 'iTunes', 'copy', ""'d"", 'hate', 'spend', 'even', 'more', 'money', 'just', 'double', 'triple', 'what', ""'ve"", 'already', 'got', 'not', 'really', 'come', 'out', 'ahead']",Jumper
1156037,AUHG8KSHI529U,B00177Y9ZC,Craig Matteson,"[1, 2]","I gave this movie an extra star because it is set in Ann Arbor (where I live) and has some footage of Huron High School and the Gallup Park around the Huron River.  Yeah, I know it is cheap of me, but I like seeing my home town on the screen.The movie is about David Rice and his ability to teleport (jump) to anywhere in the world (but not through time).  He first becomes of this ability when, as a teenager, he falls through some ice on the river and is carried downstream with no way out through the ice.  As he learns to master this ability he engages of a variety of activities that stem from his troubled personality.  Max Thieriot does a terrific job as the bullied teenager and Hayden Christensen carries the movie as you young adult version of David.Unfortunately for David, he isn't the only jumper and there is an organization of crazed folks who deem themselves authorized to find and kill any jumper they find.  They have all kinds of high tech tools to locate, contain, and a low tech knife to gut them.  These folks call themselves Paladins.  They have, according to the story, existed as long as there have been jumpers, but I wonder how they contained them without their gadgets?For me, the handling of the Paladins is a real weakness in the movie.  We don't know their true motivation, their financing, or why they are so devoted to what they do.  They are just there and are just the enemy of jumpers.  Not really enough.  However, Samuel L. Jackson does a fine job Roland, the head Paladin.The other problem with the story is that David is not a sympathetic character.  Of course, Hayden Christensen has already played one of those and handles this quite well.  I just didn't feel there was anyone in the movie to cheer for.  We side with David because the story tells us to, but we don't really like him or identify with him.  David's love object, Millie (because he really doesn't know her as a person, just as an idea he projected from himself - as most teenagers do) is the nicest person in the film, but never gets to become a full person here.The film has made more than $200 million dollars worldwide so we will probably get a sequel of some kind.  I hope they flesh out the people rather than leaving them as two-dimensional figures.  But maybe that is enough for their target audience.The movie takes us to lots of cities all over the world and that is a part of the fun.  But most of the time I wondered why the jumps went so far afield.  I know that some of it was an emotional response to a situation, but sometimes the jump could have been down the block for a similar effect to the problem at hand.  Maybe I am being too fussy.Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI",4,"An interesting idea, but without anyone to cheer for.",1215043200,"07 3, 2008",2008,2703,"['gave', 'movie', 'extra', 'star', 'set', 'Ann', 'Arbor', 'where', 'live', 'footage', 'Huron', 'High', 'School', 'Gallup', 'Park', 'Huron', 'River', 'Yeah', 'know', 'cheap', 'like', 'seeing', 'home', 'town', 'screen.The', 'movie', 'David', 'Rice', 'ability', 'teleport', 'jump', 'anywhere', 'world', 'not', 'time', 'first', 'ability', 'when', 'teenager', 'ice', 'river', 'carried', 'downstream', 'way', 'ice', 'master', 'ability', 'variety', 'activities', 'stem', 'troubled', 'personality', 'Max', 'Thieriot', 'terrific', 'job', 'bullied', 'teenager', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'movie', 'young', 'adult', 'version', 'David.Unfortunately', 'David', ""n't"", 'only', 'jumper', 'organization', 'crazed', 'folks', 'who', 'deem', 'authorized', 'find', 'kill', 'jumper', 'find', 'have', 'kinds', 'high', 'tech', 'tools', 'locate', 'contain', 'low', 'tech', 'knife', 'gut', 'folks', 'call', 'Paladins', 'have', 'according', 'story', 'existed', 'as', 'long', 'have', 'been', 'jumpers', 'wonder', 'how', 'contained', 'gadgets', 'handling', 'Paladins', 'real', 'weakness', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'true', 'motivation', 'financing', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'devoted', 'what', 'do', 'are', 'just', 'there', 'are', 'just', 'enemy', 'jumpers', 'Not', 'really', 'enough', 'However', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'fine', 'job', 'Roland', 'head', 'Paladin.The', 'other', 'problem', 'story', 'David', 'not', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'course', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'already', 'played', 'one', 'quite', 'well', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'there', 'was', 'anyone', 'movie', 'cheer', 'side', 'David', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'identify', 'David', 'love', 'object', 'Millie', 'really', ""n't"", 'know', 'person', 'just', 'idea', 'projected', 'most', 'teenagers', 'do', 'nicest', 'person', 'film', 'never', 'become', 'full', 'person', 'here.The', 'film', 'made', 'more', '200', 'million', 'dollars', 'worldwide', 'will', 'probably', 'get', 'sequel', 'kind', 'hope', 'flesh', 'out', 'people', 'rather', 'leaving', 'two-dimensional', 'figures', 'maybe', 'enough', 'target', 'movie', 'lots', 'cities', 'world', 'part', 'fun', 'most', 'time', 'wondered', 'why', 'jumps', 'went', 'so', 'far', 'afield', 'know', 'was', 'emotional', 'response', 'situation', 'sometimes', 'jump', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'down', 'block', 'similar', 'effect', 'problem', 'hand', 'Maybe', 'am', 'being', 'too', 'fussy.Reviewed', 'Craig', 'Matteson', 'Ann', 'Arbor', 'MI']",Jumper

If a system like this was in place in the United States, I guarantee you - rotten, boring trash like Jumper would never, ever be made! Half the theater would have emptied out in a heartbeat! This film is so incredibly vapid and mind-numbingly dull it genuinely insults the intelligence of  the movie going audience!!I realize movies actors need to make a living!

Each group tries to kill the other. The good guys are all really sexy looking guys and gals in there 20's! All the bad guys are about 20 years older and could be the good guys parents! And in one case, the bad guy is a parent! One of the most memorable lines: ""When you were five years old I had to either kill you or leave you. You shouldn't have come here (parent's home), but I will give you a head start."" What a pal!When I heard this line I thought to myself, ""how inspiring!"" Parents are all defective or crazy  religious zealots or non-existent.  Religious people are all fanatical killers going back to the ""Inquisition."" Only narcissistic 20-Somethings are the heroes in the world of Jumper.

Nope! He grabs a surf board and teleports to some Pacific Island country to surf those extra powerful waves! How disgusting and shocking! What are the writers of this story trying to tell us? That 20-30 year olds are so gross they only care about themselves? So, in a real sense, there are absolutely no good guys in this pathetic film!Now that the writer's strike is over I hope those responsible for crafting this depressing trash get kicked out of the Writers Union!

1156039,A2I2DE1DJUVQOO,B00177Y9ZC,DarthRad,"[6, 14]","This movie is proof positive that Hayden Christensen's really bad acting as Anakin Skywalker was not some fluke of poor editing or directorial control by George Lucas.  No, this is all Hayden Christensen.  Why people in Hollywood continue to give him major roles when there are so many other male actors out there who are just as good if not better is just beyond me.Could it be those dark overhanging eyebrows?  Seen from a certain angle, it makes him look like a brooding Calvin Klein male model, which is probably what he should be doing for a living instead of pretending to act.  Seen from other angles, however, it makes him look positively early-Neanderthal.As for the rest of the movie, Bleccchhh.  Rachel Bilson couldn't act either and there was absolutely no chemistry between them.The strangest part of the movie is that the younger high school versions of these two characters - Max Theriot and AnnaSophia Robb, were far more attractive, sympathetic actors, who actually looked like they could act.  Rachel Bilson doesn't look or act anything like AnnaSophia Robb and it was quite jarring to see her all of a sudden introduced as the older version of the same character.  It would have been far more interesting to have let the two younger actors continue as older versions of themselves for the rest of the movie.There are SO MANY plot holes in this movie.

If you like meaningless films where goofiness reigns supreme, JUMPER is your nirvana.  A young man named David (a bewildered-looking Hayden Christensen) discovers he has the ability to ""jump"" (teleport) from one location to another--anywhere in the world.  So what does he do?  Um, rob banks to set up a cushy lifestyle so he can pick up chicks by night in London and have lunch on top of the Great Sphinx of Egypt.Heaven forbid young David would do anything constructive with such an extraordinary gift. . .But wait.  There's more.  David discovers he's not alone; there are other jumpers out there (and they're all young adults; go figure).  And these jumpers are being pursued by paladins--sanctimonious Bible thumpers devoted to kill all jumpers because (we suppose, as we're never really given an explanation) they are ""evil.""  The paladins are led by a white-haired, very devout Samuel L. Jackson.  So, bewildered-looking David teams up with a fellow jumper (Jamie Bell, who is a not-so-nice jumper) to battle Jackson and the paladins--and that's when the goofiness takes over to the point poor girlfriend's (Rachel Bilson) apartment is totally trashed.Oh, and the electric ""ropes"" the paladins use to trap the jumpers so reminded me of plumbing snakes.  Just an observation.Between this flick andSnakes On A Planeol' Sam has really been freaking out.  And the gorgeous Diane Lane is totally and utterly wasted in her brief appearances.

Not that Hayden Christensen wears a funny suit or saves people, he just would fit in with X-Men's Kitty Pride like a brother. He's known as a Jumper, a person with the ability to transport to any place on Earth just by thinking of it in an instant. However, since the dawn of time, these jumpers are hunted by a group known as Paladins, led by Samuel L. Jackson (sporting some of the most metallic silver hair this side of Steve Martin) who for no other reason hunt and kill the Jumpers down due to only tradition and envy. So after a few years of robbing banks and traveling the globe, he finally is spotted, escapes back home to his old girlfriend, meets up with another Jumper, and takes on the baddies once and for all.Now normally I scoff at today's CGI effects, but this time it was done right. Every jump looked very neat and it always was a cool guessing game to think for a split second as to where they'd end up. The action sequences are well played out and the storyline's quick, to the point, and doesn't tend to drag anywhere. Sure, Christensen's acting still could use a little ""jump"" itself, but seemed to fit with the character here & Jackson can still play the hated bad guy better than most of his acting equals.In conclusion, Jumper is a fun eye-candy movie.

Then he did Mr. and Mrs. Smith, (4 stars), and now he's done this wannabe (3 stars). I don't even want to know how the sequel is going to turn out, although it has the potential to be a whole lot better. Anyways, this movie has a great concept of teleportation, used in sort of a anti-hero and selfish manner. Add a girl that was better off out of the picture, and you have a somewhat entertaining disappointment.Hayden Christensen, while no Oscar winner, isn't as bad most would have you believe, but on the other hand, you almost never see his true colors because they're hidden under boring, one-dimensional and whiny characters. And that's what this character is, boring, one-dimensional, whiny and just plain dumb. In fact, Jamie Bell's Griffin is a whole lot more exiting, experienced, has his act together, has no girlfriend dragging him down, and he's just plain cooler. A movie centered around that character would have made for a much more interesting movie. Hopefully, he'll be around in sequals as an ally.But the main problem with the movie comes in the form of Samuel L. Jackson, who gets his revenge from Hayden kicking his butt in Star Wars, and in turn shocks everybody, and stabs them with a knife that probably has a deleted scene to explain its strange mysteriousness. Or maybe it's just bad filmmaking. Anyways, Sam Jackson and his group of Jumper killers are so over the top, Evil Knievel couldn't jump over it. Sam Jackson especially. He's just so evil, he's beyond evil, not believable, and again, over the top.Then there's the ""twist"" of Diane Lane, which is not only disappointing but confusing. She's a bad guy? Now, any path they take with her character is going to be so muddled a Hummer couldn't get through it. Then there's the girlfriend, who seems pretty cardboard, and who I never could quite get into. She isn't bad lookin', but her character development seems rather predictable, and again, boring.But for all those wrongs about this movie, there is also plenty of good ones. The prologue is interesting and does a good job setting up the character, although Hayden's narration does get annoying after the first time. Then there's the action. Ahhh yes, the action. The action is entertaining, interesting, and pretty darn cool. My personal favorite was when they brought the London bus to the Egyptian desert.So overall, you have a excellent concept and tons of potential.

1156054,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B00177Y9ZC,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[1, 1]","JUMPERI remember seeing the trailers for this film when it was released and thinking ""man what a good idea for a film"". Of course it is based on a book I believe so I need to pick that up but any way I was never able to see this but finally did. After seeing this finally I have mixed feelings about it but over all enjoyed it. I have heard a lot of things about this movie and actually agree with most of them. What people love about this film is what I love and what they dislike I also agree with. So if there ever is a sequel to be made I hope they listen to the people on this one.David Rice is your average kid in school, you know the type, has a crush on a girl but he is shy and bullies pick on him. Turns out that he finally gets the courage to talk to Millie and gets his gift to her thrown out on an ice pond courtesy of bully Mark. This leads to David walking out on the ice and falling in when the ice breaks. Right when he is about to drown his first teleportation occurs, and there is no looking back from that point. He spends the next few years learning about his abilities and robbing banks, sounds like a good life being rich and can go anywhere. But there are things he left behind like the girl he liked, his dad, and oh yeah people are hunting him down. Just another day in the life of a jumper I suppose.The thing about this film that I found a little disappointing is that there is not any character development for the most part. All the characters are just introduced and off we go, one reason to read the book I guess. Also the film seemed like different movies at times, it needed to find an identity. Still there are so good things that come out of this film such as the action. The action comes plenty of times and always is entertaining and may be the redeeming thing about this film. The fact that they can transport things with them that are very large add to the excitement. Well not fact since this is fictional and all but you know what I mean.Acting wise Michael Rooker is always a pleasure to see and of course brings forth a good performance, the scene with him and Jackson may be my favorite. Speaking of Jackson you know of course that Samuel L. Jackson brings a little something to the role of the guy trying to kill off the Jumpers. Still I get the feeling he was there for a paycheck. Regardless I love watching him on the screen so I will say he was a plus. Still the scene stealer in my opinion was Jamie Bell who plays Griffin, a fellow Jumper who is hunting Jackson's character. From his accent to the way he really does not care about anyone else he does an excellent job. Of course we have our lead David played by Hayden Christenson who at times seem on in the role but at others off. Still although his performance is shaky at times he seemed like he had fun in the role. His girl played by Rachel Bilson seemed like she had the same problem so I don't know what that was about. Also I would like to mention that Teddy Dunn was great for the short time he was on screen as the bully.Based on the book by Steven Gould the blame may lay within the writers circle, the film did not know what it wanted to be. Written by people who brought us Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Sherlock Holmes, Fight Club, The Dark Knight, Batman Begins, and the Blade film series I expected more. Of course the mix of three writers or whatever may have been the cause for the unevenness. Of course the director could be the problem since the unevenness could be mixed direction. Still it is hard to say that because this guy directed Go, Swingers [two of my favorite films ever], Mr. & Mrs. Smith, and The Bourne Identity, I guess it is a mix of everything.Over all I did enjoy this film, much more than most people I did guess from what people I know said about the film. Perhaps that is why I liked the film since I went in with no expectations. Sure when it was first released I would have most likely not liked it but since I waited and heard things it saved the film for me. This is not a classic film but the idea behind it is a great premise. I think a sequel is coming and hopefully it surpasses the first film. I do recommend the film but a rental may be the best idea, you may like it.",3,CERTAIN THINGS SAVE IT,1264118400,"01 22, 2010",2010,4211,"['JUMPERI', 'remember', 'seeing', 'trailers', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'thinking', 'man', 'what', 'good', 'idea', 'film', 'course', 'based', 'book', 'believe', 'so', 'need', 'pick', 'up', 'way', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'see', 'finally', 'did', 'seeing', 'finally', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'enjoyed', 'have', 'heard', 'lot', 'things', 'movie', 'actually', 'agree', 'most', 'What', 'people', 'love', 'film', 'what', 'love', 'what', 'dislike', 'also', 'agree', 'So', 'ever', 'sequel', 'be', 'made', 'hope', 'listen', 'people', 'one.David', 'Rice', 'average', 'kid', 'school', 'know', 'type', 'crush', 'girl', 'shy', 'bullies', 'pick', 'out', 'finally', 'courage', 'talk', 'Millie', 'gift', 'thrown', 'out', 'ice', 'pond', 'courtesy', 'bully', 'Mark', 'David', 'walking', 'out', 'ice', 'falling', 'when', 'ice', 'breaks', 'Right', 'when', 'drown', 'first', 'teleportation', 'occurs', 'looking', 'back', 'point', 'next', 'few', 'years', 'learning', 'abilities', 'robbing', 'banks', 'sounds', 'good', 'life', 'being', 'rich', 'can', 'go', 'anywhere', 'are', 'things', 'left', 'girl', 'liked', 'dad', 'oh', 'yeah', 'people', 'are', 'hunting', 'down', 'Just', 'day', 'life', 'jumper', 'suppose.The', 'thing', 'film', 'found', 'little', 'disappointing', 'not', 'character', 'development', 'most', 'part', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'introduced', 'go', 'one', 'reason', 'read', 'book', 'guess', 'Also', 'film', 'seemed', 'different', 'movies', 'times', 'needed', 'find', 'identity', 'Still', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'things', 'come', 'film', 'such', 'action', 'action', 'plenty', 'times', 'always', 'entertaining', 'may', 'be', 'redeeming', 'thing', 'film', 'fact', 'can', 'transport', 'things', 'are', 'very', 'large', 'add', 'excitement', 'Well', 'not', 'fact', 'fictional', 'know', 'what', 'mean.Acting', 'wise', 'Michael', 'Rooker', 'always', 'pleasure', 'see', 'course', 'brings', 'forth', 'good', 'performance', 'scene', 'Jackson', 'may', 'be', 'favorite', 'Speaking', 'Jackson', 'know', 'course', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'little', 'something', 'role', 'guy', 'trying', 'kill', 'off', 'Jumpers', 'Still', 'get', 'feeling', 'was', 'there', 'paycheck', 'Regardless', 'love', 'watching', 'screen', 'so', 'will', 'say', 'was', 'plus', 'Still', 'scene', 'stealer', 'opinion', 'was', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'who', 'Griffin', 'fellow', 'Jumper', 'who', 'hunting', 'Jackson', 'character', 'accent', 'way', 'really', 'not', 'care', 'anyone', 'else', 'excellent', 'job', 'course', 'have', 'lead', 'David', 'played', 'Hayden', 'Christenson', 'who', 'times', 'seem', 'role', 'others', 'Still', 'performance', 'shaky', 'times', 'seemed', 'had', 'fun', 'role', 'girl', 'played', 'Rachel', 'Bilson', 'seemed', 'had', 'same', 'problem', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'Also', 'would', 'like', 'mention', 'Teddy', 'Dunn', 'was', 'great', 'short', 'time', 'was', 'screen', 'bully.Based', 'book', 'Steven', 'Gould', 'blame', 'may', 'lay', 'writers', 'circle', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'wanted', 'be', 'Written', 'people', 'who', 'brought', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Blade', 'film', 'series', 'expected', 'more', 'course', 'mix', 'three', 'writers', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'cause', 'unevenness', 'course', 'director', 'could', 'be', 'problem', 'unevenness', 'could', 'be', 'mixed', 'direction', 'Still', 'hard', 'say', 'guy', 'directed', 'Go', 'Swingers', '[', 'two', 'favorite', 'films', 'ever', ']', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'guess', 'mix', 'everything.Over', 'did', 'enjoy', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'most', 'people', 'did', 'guess', 'what', 'people', 'know', 'said', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'why', 'liked', 'film', 'went', 'expectations', 'Sure', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'would', 'have', 'most', 'likely', 'not', 'liked', 'waited', 'heard', 'things', 'saved', 'film', 'not', 'classic', 'film', 'idea', 'great', 'premise', 'think', 'sequel', 'coming', 'hopefully', 'first', 'film', 'do', 'recommend', 'film', 'rental', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'idea', 'may', 'like']",Jumper

Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson as the mid-twenties David and Millie just does not work.  There is no spark, no chemical reaction.  Rachel Bilson is a talented actress, but her talent was wasted in this film opposite Christensen who never showed the exuberant teenage David.Samuel Jackson adds a nice touch as Roland, the religious zealot Paladin who hunts jumpers because they are an abomination since they possess powers which should be reserved for God only. Jamie Bell as Griffin, the seasoned jumper, carries the second half of this film.Diana Lane and Michael Rooker as Mary and William Rice are wasted in this film.  These talented actors deserved more screen time and a better script.The jump scenes are well done.  The fight in the coliseum and in Millie's apartment and Griffin's lair are exciting.The Paladins have a rich history of being warriors.  It is sad this film did not give a peek into this rich history.Overall, I give this film 3 stars for the first part with the teenagers, the concept and effects and for Jackson and Bell's characters which definitely save this film.

I've liked Hayden Christensen since I saw ""Life as a House,"" and Samuel L. just rips up a villain role like nobody's business. The special effects were very well done and I was delighted to find that the main storyline they implied in the commercials is NOT what happened! Sure, the main character can teleport, but the rest.... The movie is billed as scifi/thriller type, but that's a bit misleading. This is more like the Highlander films, a fantasy element in the real world.The movie was pretty fast paced with only a couple slower moments, and the character's self-exploration once he discovers the ability was almost as good as Peter Parker's in the first Spider-Man movie. Actually, in one way it was better. Peter uses his power to win a wrestling match and then jumps right into the hero role. Our similarly-aged jumper, however, jumps right into a bank vault, and a store, and...! *grin* He really is an ordinary person with an extraordinary ability.  He used his ability for theft, but also for taking his surfboard to Fiji for the best waves.  I liked the movie enough that I quickly ordered the book.  They are COMPLETELY different, but both good for different reasons.  The movie added a opposing force for jumpers (i.e. a ""villain"") whereas in the book, David mostly battles his own inner demons (with a lot of introspection).  Plus, the very cool character of Griffin was completely made-up for the film.  His character adds great action while giving viewers another jumper to identify with besides David.  Though the movie had closure, they left it wide open for a sequel that I really hope gets made.I think some viewers were overly critical of this film.  It's not going to win any oscars, but I was entertained and that's the most important criteria.As to the DVD itself, I have to say, do NOT buy the 2-disc edition.  The second disk contains only a digital copy.  All the extras are on disc one, which the regular edition has!  I really wish the product description had been more clear on this.  I wouldn't have paid the additional $6 for a digital copy which you have to use a keycode to transfer.  The code is located on a card in the case, but it clearly states to be careful not to lose it.  Also, the outer sleeve has a holographic image of the cover art that is glued to the front of the sleeve.  I don't see it lasting long.  Finally, once again the studio includes ads in the case, but no insert with chapter index and extra features.The extra features were pretty standard.  There's commentary, making of, interviews with the authors/producer etc, book to film featurette, and some deleted scenes (all of which I felt were rightly cut from the film).  The interviews were interesting sinc ethey touched on how the producer obviously changed the book, and how the author felt.  Nothing spectacular here, but for a single disc edition these were perfectly fine - and far more than they offered with ""the Bourne Ultimatium"".",4,"Good, fun movie",1208995200,"04 24, 2008",2008,3061,"['went', 'see', 'Jumper', 'family', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'have', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'saw', 'Life', 'House', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'just', 'up', 'villain', 'role', 'nobody', 'business', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'was', 'delighted', 'find', 'main', 'storyline', 'implied', 'commercials', 'NOT', 'what', 'happened', 'Sure', 'main', 'character', 'can', 'teleport', 'rest', 'movie', 'billed', 'scifi/thriller', 'type', 'bit', 'misleading', 'more', 'Highlander', 'films', 'fantasy', 'element', 'real', 'world.The', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'fast', 'paced', 'only', 'couple', 'slower', 'moments', 'character', 'self-exploration', 'once', 'ability', 'was', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'first', 'Spider-Man', 'movie', 'Actually', 'one', 'way', 'was', 'better', 'Peter', 'power', 'win', 'wrestling', 'match', 'then', 'jumps', 'right', 'hero', 'role', 'similarly-aged', 'jumper', 'however', 'jumps', 'right', 'bank', 'vault', 'store', '*grin*', 'really', 'ordinary', 'person', 'extraordinary', 'ability', 'used', 'ability', 'theft', 'also', 'taking', 'surfboard', 'Fiji', 'best', 'waves', 'liked', 'movie', 'quickly', 'ordered', 'book', 'are', 'COMPLETELY', 'different', 'good', 'different', 'reasons', 'movie', 'added', 'opposing', 'force', 'jumpers', 'i.e', 'villain', 'whereas', 'book', 'David', 'mostly', 'own', 'inner', 'demons', 'lot', 'introspection', 'very', 'cool', 'character', 'Griffin', 'was', 'completely', 'made-up', 'film', 'character', 'great', 'action', 'giving', 'viewers', 'jumper', 'identify', 'besides', 'David', 'movie', 'had', 'closure', 'left', 'wide', 'open', 'sequel', 'really', 'hope', 'made.I', 'think', 'viewers', 'were', 'overly', 'critical', 'film', 'not', 'going', 'win', 'oscars', 'was', 'entertained', 'most', 'important', 'criteria.As', 'DVD', 'have', 'say', 'do', 'NOT', 'buy', '2-disc', 'edition', 'second', 'disk', 'only', 'digital', 'copy', 'extras', 'are', 'disc', 'one', 'regular', 'edition', 'really', 'wish', 'product', 'description', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'clear', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'paid', 'additional', '6', 'digital', 'copy', 'have', 'use', 'keycode', 'transfer', 'code', 'located', 'card', 'case', 'clearly', 'be', 'careful', 'not', 'lose', 'Also', 'outer', 'sleeve', 'holographic', 'image', 'cover', 'art', 'glued', 'front', 'sleeve', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'lasting', 'long', 'Finally', 'once', 'again', 'studio', 'ads', 'case', 'insert', 'chapter', 'index', 'extra', 'features.The', 'extra', 'features', 'were', 'pretty', 'standard', 'commentary', 'making', 'interviews', 'authors/producer', 'etc', 'book', 'film', 'featurette', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'felt', 'were', 'rightly', 'cut', 'film', 'interviews', 'were', 'interesting', 'sinc', 'ethey', 'touched', 'how', 'producer', 'obviously', 'changed', 'book', 'how', 'author', 'felt', 'Nothing', 'spectacular', 'here', 'single', 'disc', 'edition', 'were', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'far', 'more', 'offered', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatium']",Jumper

""A New Yorker""","[3, 3]","For the generation that won't wait for anything, the teleporting protagonists of Jumper may have more appeal than the likes of Spiderman and Wolverine. If you skip ads, sneak a peek at the last chapter of a book, have ever wanted to fast forward through a boring flight, or truncate the dull commute to work, it may be your fantasies that Hayden Christensen is living in Bourne director Doug Liman's globe-trotting sci-fi outing.Not content with such mundane shortcuts, gadabout Christensen is disposed to good living - financed by teleporting away the contents of bank - in a New York penthouse; he breakfasts on top of the Sphinx, checks out London from the clock-face of Big Ben before going on the pull, and flits in and out of a series of holiday hot-spot locations that resemble a fast flick through a travel-agent's plushest brochure. But one day jumper-hunter Samuel L. Jackson - wearing the daftest hairpiece since Morgan Freeman impersonated R. Lee Ermey in Dreamcatcher - is waiting for him with a wake-up call. Jackson is a Paladin, a sect that has been hunting those Godless teleporters since at least the middle-ages, though the invention of electricity has given them the ability to pin the fidgety globetrotters down while they run them through with a nasty hunting-knife.Jumper had a lot of potential and it was a frustrating film. It's beautifully shot, with an intriguing premise, and a great performance from Samuel L. Jackson. Unfortunately, it's also got some cringe worthy dialog, distractingly large plot holes, and a zero charisma female lead in Rachel Bilson. The film looks great, featuring some jaw-dropping location photography, but the plot is a hodgepodge of underdeveloped elements. Diane Lane gets third billing for about five minutes of screen time in a throwaway role with absolutely no payoff. Jamie Bell, easily the best of the cast aside from Jackson, crafts a far more interesting character than lead Hayden Christensen, yet the script (credited to three different writers) regulates him to little more than a plot device. Worst of all is Rachel Bilson's character, who seems like an afterthought at best. The script's paper-thin characterization forces her to flesh out her role with sheer charisma, and, unlike Jackson, she's just not up to it.There are moments, more than a few, in fact, where Jumper gets it right. The opening sequence, leading up to Christensen's character's discovery of his powers it spot-on, as are just about every one of Jackson's scenes, but these only serve to build false hope. This is a movie in search of an identity. Is it a super-hero movie? A romance? A sci-fi epic? Jumper feels like a movie made by a committee hell-bent on creating a franchise and that, ultimately, proves to be its undoing. Much as Jackson's character is fond of saying that no man should be all places at all times; no movie should be all things to all people. Bottom Line: Jumper is an unfortunate mess of a movie that wastes some beautiful photography and a great performance by Samuel L. Jackson.",2,Don't Jump at the chance with this film........,1220832000,"09 8, 2008",2008,3045,"['generation', 'wo', ""n't"", 'wait', 'anything', 'teleporting', 'protagonists', 'Jumper', 'may', 'have', 'more', 'appeal', 'likes', 'Spiderman', 'Wolverine', 'skip', 'ads', 'sneak', 'peek', 'last', 'chapter', 'book', 'have', 'ever', 'wanted', 'fast', 'forward', 'boring', 'flight', 'truncate', 'dull', 'commute', 'work', 'may', 'be', 'fantasies', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'living', 'Bourne', 'director', 'Doug', 'Liman', 'globe-trotting', 'sci-fi', 'outing.Not', 'content', 'such', 'mundane', 'shortcuts', 'gadabout', 'Christensen', 'disposed', 'good', 'living', 'financed', 'teleporting', 'away', 'contents', 'bank', 'New', 'York', 'penthouse', 'top', 'Sphinx', 'out', 'London', 'clock-face', 'Big', 'Ben', 'going', 'pull', 'flits', 'series', 'holiday', 'hot-spot', 'locations', 'resemble', 'fast', 'flick', 'travel-agent', 'plushest', 'brochure', 'one', 'day', 'jumper-hunter', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'wearing', 'daftest', 'hairpiece', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'impersonated', 'R.', 'Lee', 'Ermey', 'Dreamcatcher', 'waiting', 'wake-up', 'call', 'Jackson', 'Paladin', 'sect', 'been', 'hunting', 'Godless', 'teleporters', 'least', 'middle-ages', 'invention', 'electricity', 'given', 'ability', 'pin', 'fidgety', 'globetrotters', 'down', 'run', 'nasty', 'hunting-knife.Jumper', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'was', 'frustrating', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'great', 'performance', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Unfortunately', 'also', 'got', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'dialog', 'distractingly', 'large', 'plot', 'holes', 'zero', 'charisma', 'female', 'lead', 'Rachel', 'Bilson', 'film', 'great', 'featuring', 'jaw-dropping', 'location', 'photography', 'plot', 'hodgepodge', 'underdeveloped', 'elements', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'third', 'billing', 'five', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'throwaway', 'role', 'absolutely', 'payoff', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'easily', 'best', 'cast', 'aside', 'Jackson', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'character', 'lead', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'yet', 'script', 'credited', 'three', 'different', 'writers', 'little', 'more', 'plot', 'device', 'Worst', 'Rachel', 'Bilson', 'character', 'who', 'afterthought', 'best', 'script', 'paper-thin', 'characterization', 'flesh', 'out', 'role', 'sheer', 'charisma', 'Jackson', 'just', 'not', 'up', 'it.There', 'are', 'moments', 'more', 'few', 'fact', 'where', 'Jumper', 'right', 'opening', 'sequence', 'leading', 'up', 'Christensen', 'character', 'discovery', 'powers', 'spot-on', 'are', 'just', 'one', 'Jackson', 'scenes', 'only', 'serve', 'build', 'false', 'hope', 'movie', 'search', 'identity', 'super-hero', 'movie', 'romance', 'sci-fi', 'epic', 'Jumper', 'movie', 'made', 'committee', 'hell-bent', 'creating', 'franchise', 'ultimately', 'be', 'undoing', 'Much', 'Jackson', 'character', 'fond', 'saying', 'man', 'should', 'be', 'places', 'times', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'things', 'people', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'Jumper', 'unfortunate', 'mess', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'great', 'performance', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson']",Jumper

He leaves his father (Michael Rooker) and his best friend (Rachel Bilson) to go rob banks with his teleporting power and live alone.8 years later he finds her again and she agrees to go to Rome with him just like that. As if he's not lucky enough that a hot girl like Rachel Bilson is still single.While an agent played by Samuel L. Jackson wants to kill him just because ""only god should have this power"" he explains. A better explanation would have been ""because I'm one bad Motha....and the movie needed a villain"".Another Jumper ""well played by Billy Elliot's Jamie Bell"" follows Hayden's Jumper around because he's using him as bait. He hunts the Jumper killers and knows they are after Christensen. That's what I guess anyway since the movie never explains why he's following him.Jumper has a lot of energy and some nice locations and some cool moments. The script is thin though. It's a wannabe super hero movie and that's about it. I'd rather just see a teleporter movie with Alan Cummings as Night Crawler again.Jumper never explains how Jumpers become Jumpers. While Jackson's excuse for killing them just wasn't a good enough excuse. He says most Jumpers become bad and that only god should have this power ""one of his worse lines he has ever had to utter"". Yet not one Jumper we meet in the movie even seems evil.

Alas, for the first quarter of the film, one pervasively feels that sentiment. Moreover one could negate and question that portion of the film as insipid b-grade novelty. Though please think again and reconsider. Once you get pass the irritating puppy dog face of Hayden Christensen and the (SPOILER ALERT) controversial, immoral death of his pan-Marvel Comics partner in crime (the Englishman Jamie Bell) and the lack of loyalty shown by the former protagonist, I assure you you're in for a treat.The romance segment of the film is quite universal, especially for underdog SNAGS (Sensitive New Age Guys) who were bullied, neglected in high school...but somehow overcame the odds, plus stays loyal to their first adolescent flame and love interest (the heroine of this film is played by Rachel Bilson). Samuel L. Jackson plays an effective, although stereotypical villain (trite and spiceless): but either way any African-American character with glittering white hair will shine through (pun intended)- meaning his presence is quantifiable and valid.The whole concept of the film is so wondrously unique. Doug Liman's (director of The Bourne Identity and producer of the sequel) visceral, superlative action scenes; in dichotomy to the sci-fi angle - leads to a bit of a chicken or egg question as to the genre placement/marketing derivative of which should come first in the nous spotlight.

There are rumours in the grapevine to make this into a franchised trilogy, and whilst I have doubts on the logistics and origin of where the plot would be conjured up from, I'm sure The West's ingenious resilience to trample out and perpetuate the deep reservoir and production line of pop films (e.g. Ironman) will prevail.

Blink-and-it's-over movie, blink-and-it's-over review... appropriate no?  Anyway, away we go...This fast-paced (but not ridiculously fast-paced as the trailer seemed to indicate) ""X-Men"" style adventure is worth a look for its solid premise, edgy characters, and exciting confrontations.  I especially liked the occasional nods in the direction of character complexity: Hayden Christensen's ""Jumper"" character maybe isn't the basically nice guy he initially seems to be and Sam Jackson's relentlessly hunting ""Paladin"" character maybe isn't really as bad as HE initially seems.  In other words, maybe Jackson's character is right and all past jumpers HAVE become rotten eggs- dangerous rotten eggs- after a while, and need to be put down.  Clearly much was left open for exploration in a sequel.Strangely, some of that exploration could have been done in this very movie, as it's only an hour and twenty-nine minutes long.  Could it have killed 'em to give us ten more minutes of character material and background info to supplement the generous (and, admittedly, very well done) action sequences?  At an hour and 40 or 45 minutes, this movie would still have been lean and mean, but also a little richer.  Still, ""Jumper"" is worth a look for fans of super-powered characters and gritty adventure.The DVD features a full screen print on one side of the disc and a widescreen print on the other.

1156091,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B00177Y9ZC,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[2, 3]","I really hate it when a movie that I was really excited about seeing ends up completely disappointing me once I finally get the opportunity to watch it. Such was the case with the recent release of ""Jumper"" from director Doug Liman (""The Bourne Identity"" and ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith""), starring Hayden Christensen, Samuel L. Jackson, Rachel Bilson, and Jamie Bell. The previews were entertaining, showcasing the film's impressive visual effects, and showing what turned out to be the best scenes from star Hayden Christensen's performance, in order to paint him in a much more positive light in regards to his less than stellar acting ability. Not surprising to me and many others was the fact that the film was universally panned by the majority of critics across the nation, yet I still wanted to see the movie, because I figured it would still be entertaining due to the fact that critics generally despise science-fiction, and well I generally disagree with them on that genre. Sadly, after watching the film, I now find myself having to say that I completely agree with the throng of critics that blasted the film, and I feel like I wasted 90 minutes of my life that I will never get back on what is possibly the worst film of 2008.""Jumper"" is the story of David Rice (Hayden Christensen), a man who was bullied throughout his childhood and ends up leaving the love of his life, a girl named Millie (Rachel Bilson) to start over, and is now living the good life with all the wealth he could possibly imagine. He's a man who appears to have everything a person could ask for, except he's never had to work for any of it; instead, he uses his amazing ability to teleport from place to place taking anything and everything he wants for himself. David believes he is the only one of his kind until he meets another `jumper' named Griffin (Jamie Bell) who warns him of a group known as the Paladins, that are led by a mysterious and deadly man named Roland (Samuel L. Jackson), their goal is to find and eliminate all `jumpers' from the face of the Earth. Now, David finds himself stuck in the middle of a war he doesn't understand, with the fate of not only himself but everyone he cares about hanging in the balance.While I was watching ""Jumper"" a couple of things went through my mind over the course of the film. First, is the extreme confusion in regards to why executives in Hollywood continue to believe that Hayden Christensen (best known for his work in the `Star Wars' prequels) is even a remotely decent actor? Lets face it the man cannot act, he was mediocre at best in his first starring role in the smash hit ""Star Wars - Episode 2: Attack of the Clones"" and seemed a little bit more comfortable and skilled in ""Star Wars - Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith""; however, even in those films (which are by far his best work to date) he was nothing to be all that impressed by as far as his acting talent was concerned. In the recent release ""Awake"" co-starring Jessica Alba, I thought Hayden had possibly improved his acting game to the point that he was finally an average movie star, but with his work in ""Jumper"" he quickly put that thought to rest, and firmly cemented himself in my mind as quite possibly the worst actor in all of Hollywood. Well, now that I've got that tirade out of the way I can continue on with what other thoughts occurred to me while I was watching this sub-par movie.The next thing I wonder is why is it that good, sometimes even great actors lower their standards in order to star in drivel such as this. Veteran actor Samuel L. Jackson (`Star Wars' prequels) has made so many great movies throughout his career, along with a few stinkers along the way as any actor does from time to time, but why would he even be remotely interested in wasting his considerable talents on this movie is beyond me. The same goes for Diane Lane (""Untraceable"") who has gained more and more credibility as an actress in Hollywood throughout the last decade or so, but then she does a film like this, and you wonder if maybe she's starting to lose her ability to discern between good and bad movie roles. My only guess, and the only way that I figure these stars can keep their respect and reputations intact, is that they only made ""Jumper"" for the paycheck, which I would hope was a ridiculously large amount, otherwise the choice just doesn't make sense to me.The story in ""Jumper"" began with some possibility of being interesting to me, but then things began to unravel when Hayden Christensen began speaking his lines as blandly as possible. Aside from that, the story quickly appeared to be too shallow to really draw me into this supposedly ancient war between `jumpers' and the zealous Paladins. I wanted more depth to be given to what drives the Paladins to hunt the `jumpers', explanation as to why the `jumpers' always seem to commit crime instead of using their ability for good, and most importantly what the writers were thinking when they chose to make the hero of the movie, Hayden's character David, into such an idiot and a weakling. I mean he's always getting caught, and whenever he gets into a fight he always gets his rear handed to him, that is until he teleports to achieve the upper hand, but in a fair fight he always loses, how are we supposed to root for someone like that. Not to mention the fact that when the other `jumpers' are caught by the Paladins they seem to have a much harder time of escaping, yet David escapes with relative ease by comparison, and his partner in crime, Griffin (Jamie Bell) even points out how stupid David is for getting caught all the time when he makes the statement, ""How is it you have survived this long?"" (or something along those lines). All in all, the story written by Simon Kinberg (""Mr. and Mrs. Smith""), who rewrote the film after two previous scripts from writers David S. Goyer (""Batman Begins"") and Jim Uhl (""Fight Club"") were rejected by the film's director Doug Liman, was full of so many holes and instances in the story where it seemed the audience was just supposed to fill in the gaps to make the movie make sense, that I wonder if there was a lot of content that had been edited out of the final film, and if a director's cut of ""Jumper"" would possibly make for a better movie experience, although I don't think I could sit through any more of Hayden's horrible acting in this film than I already have.From a visual effects standpoint, ""Jumper"" is virtually flawless thanks to the extremely talented group at Weta Digital (""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer""). The teleportation sequences are fun, and at first are exciting to see; however, the film uses the effect so much that it becomes tiresome and each `jump' sequence looks and feels just like the last to where you don't look forward to seeing them anymore. Now, I've seen special effects be repeated within movies before (""bullet time"" in the critically acclaimed ""The Matrix""), but generally when an effect is used more than once something is done to make it feel different than the previous, and that just did not seem to be the case in ""Jumper"". I don't know if the increasingly bland feeling I had towards the film's over-reliance on the same effect was because of a lack of imagination on Weta's part (which I doubt, given their stellar work in the past) or a lack of imagination and/or creativity on behalf of director Doug Liman (which is where I'm more inclined to assign the blame for not only this, but the entire failure of this movie).Overall, ""Jumper"" had the potential to be an extremely entertaining, science-fiction action adventure film; however, weak acting, an overly simplistic storyline, and visual effects that went from brilliant to boring brought this film quickly to its knees and left me feeling like I lost a couple of brain cells in the process of having to turn my brain off in order to even sit through the 90 minute run time for the film.""Jumper"" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and sexuality.",2,Jump Over This Movie...,1214352000,"06 25, 2008",2008,7993,"['really', 'hate', 'when', 'movie',

I'm so glad that I have the great DVD.  Doug Liman had directed another favorite of mine,Mr. & Mrs. Smith (Widescreen Edition).  In adapting Steven Gould's novel, the current executive producer of TV's new ""Knight Rider"" series planned for a three-part picture franchise.  Hayden Christensen who came to prominence as Anakin Skywalker in Episodes II & III of ""Star Wars"" and earned a Golden Globe Best Supporting Actor nomination for 2001's ""Life as a House"" plays David Rice, a young man who can teleport instantly.  We learn a back history of war between the jumpers and those out to destroy them, the Paladins.  Samuel L. Jackson who was great inS.W.A.T. (Widescreen Special Edition)and got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for ""Pulp Fiction"" plays the white-haired Roland who hunts David.  David's high school heartthrob is Millie played by TV's ""O.C."" Rachel Bilson who was also excellent in The Last Kiss (Widescreen Edition).  David runs into another jumper played by Jamie Bell who won the British Best Actor Academy Award for ""Billy Elliott"" and also appeared in Clint Eastwood's ""Flags of Our Fathers.""  Diane Lane has what is essentially a cameo that would be sure to grow if there is a second film.  She plays David's mother Mary who is a Paladin.  She loves her son, but also has vowed to kill him.  Michael Rooker has a great cameo as the alcoholic father William Rice.  Oscar nominee Tom Hulce from 1984's ""Amadeus"" plays Mr. Bowlker.

The two leads, Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson, give pitiful performances as one-dimensional characters caught in a matrix of whiz-bang special effects-- which aren't even all that good or even very interesting.  Might be entertaining if you grew up watching MTV music videos, because it is fairly short and it's completely pointless to expend gray matter activity trying to figure out what's happening.

C'mon, man! Sam Jackson, baby! He was cool as the paladin leader with Anakin Skywalker as the jumper. (We actually liked the european bad boy jumper somewhat better! Good actor.)JUMPER had loads of mystery and action/adventure excitement - as well as a huge surprising ending - that will leave you wanting more. Liman yet again proves he is a top-notch director. We loved his original Bourne movie. The first beat the other two by leaps and bounds! (The last one was a total bore fest!)And then, with Mr. and Mrs. Smith he took the comedy/action genre and sent it through the stratosphere! Although Jumper isn't as great as that last film, it is still WAY better than most junk coming out these days, all geared towards teens.Sure Jumper leaves open questions at th end. There are several books out in this series, and Hollywood loves a sequel. And we want one!And we'll bet every reviewer who gave this movie bad marks would go see it too! One way or another.Sure the movie had its problems, but director Doug Liman handles the movie in a quick pacing with loads of beautiful special effects, great action sequences that were very original and huge in scope. Very refreshing. Also, if you want to see some of the most impressive sights in the world, Jumper takes you there!Excellent movie, despite its few quirks.

The story is simple, the special effects and international sets are amazing, and the acting is ... well you can't have anything.  The young actors here are given very few lines to work with and might not meet the high standards of those who want every movie, including an action fantasy movie, to have award worthy acting.Many people will have to wonder what I wondered when I first read the reviews here: did I see the same movie as everybody else?  Why has this movie been panned by so many people?Fans of the original novel tend to be against this movie because it deviates from the original story and offers a much more film-friendly short version.Jumper: A Novel (Jumper)There was a ""prequel"" story written to transition fans to this story, and you can check out those reviews to see their reactions.Jumper: Jumpscars - The Official Prequel to the Film (Jumper)I appreciate great acting, but I didn't expect Indiana Jones to win for best actor.  I likewise didn't expect too much from this acting-wise. Hayden Christensen may not the most expressive actor, but the kid is young!  Be realistic!  Actually, Bilson's portrayal as Millie was much less impressive, an overly flirty one-dimensional take.  And Samuel L. Jackson was almost getting paid twice for the role he played in ""Unbreakable,"" except here his character has the weapons and the strength to really fight the heroes.Many people also seem to want more back-story and explainations for the science behind his ability to teleport.  Yet don't the backstories in most movies like this make them even less believable?  How often in life do people stop in the middle of something to explain how and why everything is happening?  I was glad that they didn't waste time trying to explain a work of imagination.  This is a science fiction concept, nothing more.This movie, when viewed as just a movie, is great entertainment and very fun to watch.  Coming into this just as a movie-goer with no preconceived notions, I loved it.  I could suspend disbelief because I know how to let my imagination go when it comes to science fiction.Essentially, Hayden Christensen plays a young kid who is bullied at school and harassed by an alcoholic father.  He discovers his ability to teleport, and soon is making a new life for himself teleporting all over the world.  He soon discovers he's not the only ""Jumper"" out there, and that a group of paladins are determined to find and kill jumpers.  He returns to his hometown to find his high school crush, and has to deal with telling her his secret ability.The pacing was really well done.  This movie moves along very quickly.  It may leave a lot of unanswered questions but it also never leaves you dragging.  The score is well done, but there could have been more songs to create a real soundtrack.  They make up for it by moving from location to location with amazing cinematography.And let me tell you, the sets are amazing!  The camera work on top of Big Ben, at the Sphinx, on the Pyramids, and on and on, it was all amazing.  For those wide shots alone it's worth seeing in the theatres.  I was so jealous this guy could go wherever he wanted, from Europe to Africa to Asia.  I can't wait for the DVD to find out which locations were shot on set and which were created via CGI or some other means.Other special effects are impressive as well, as we see the ""residue"" of the jumper's as they teleport.  The paladins also have their own tools which are perhaps not as cool. There's also an amazing couple of fight scenes that are peppered in.The movie does end very quickly, and is clearly based on a plot designed for sequels.  That leaves the story with a lot of loose ends.  Still, I for one would gladly subject myself to a sequel, even look forward to one.If you want realism, going to see a fantasy thriller isn't going to give it to you.  If you want fun and love science fiction or comics, this movie is fun to watch.Enjoy!",3,"Jumper, Worth Watching for Science Fiction Fans, Give it a Try!",1204848000,"03 7, 2008",2008,4136,"['Jumper', '[', 'Theatrical', 'Release', ']', 'Jumper', 'good', 'movie', 'will', 'appeal', 'science', 'fiction', 'lovers', 'comic', 'book', 'junkies', 'anybody', 'who', 'ever', 'wanted', 'travel', 'world', 'blowing', 'bank', 'account', 'story', 'simple', 'special', 'effects', 'international', 'sets', 'are', 'amazing', 'acting', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'young', 'actors', 'here', 'are', 'given', 'very', 'few', 'lines', 'work', 'might', 'not', 'meet', 'high', 'standards', 'who', 'want', 'movie', 'including', 'action', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'have', 'award', 'worthy', 'acting.Many', 'people', 'will', 'have', 'wonder', 'what', 'wondered', 'when', 'first', 'read', 'reviews', 'here', 'did', 'see', 'same', 'movie', 'everybody', 'else', 'Why', 'movie', 'been', 'panned', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'Fans', 'original', 'novel', 'tend', 'be', 'movie', 'original', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'film-friendly', 'short', 'version.Jumper', 'Novel', 'Jumper', 'was', 'prequel', 'story', 'written', 'transition', 'fans', 'story', 'can', 'check', 'out', 'reviews', 'see', 'reactions.Jumper', 'Jumpscars', 'Official', 'Prequel', 'Film', 'Jumper', 'appreciate', 'great', 'acting', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'win', 'best', 'actor', 'likewise', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'acting-wise', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'may', 'not', 'most', 'expressive', 'actor', 'kid', 'young', 'Be', 'realistic', 'Actually', 'Bilson', 'portrayal', 'Millie', 'was', 'much', 'less', 'impressive', 'overly', 'flirty', 'one-dimensional', 'take', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'was', 'almost', 'getting', 'paid', 'twice', 'role', 'played', 'Unbreakable', 'here', 'character', 'weapons', 'strength', 'really', 'fight', 'heroes.Many', 'people', 'also', 'seem', 'want', 'more', 'back-story', 'explainations', 'science', 'ability', 'teleport', 'do', ""n't"", 'backstories', 'most', 'movies', 'make', 'even', 'less', 'believable', 'How', 'often', 'life', 'do', 'people', 'stop', 'middle', 'something', 'explain', 'how', 'why', 'everything', 'happening', 'was', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'trying', 'explain', 'work', 'imagination', 'science', 'fiction', 'concept', 'nothing', 'more.This', 'movie', 'when', 'viewed', 'just', 'movie', 'great', 'entertainment', 'very', 'fun', 'watch', 'Coming', 'just', 'movie-goer', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'loved', 'could', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'know', 'how', 'let', 'imagination', 'go', 'when', 'science', 'fiction.Essentially', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'young', 'kid', 'who', 'bullied', 'school', 'harassed', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'ability', 'teleport', 'soon', 'making', 'new', 'life', 'teleporting', 'world', 'soon', 'not', 'only', 'Jumper', 'there', 'group', 'paladins', 'are', 'determined', 'find', 'kill', 'jumpers', 'hometown', 'find', 'high', 'school', 'crush', 'deal', 'telling', 'secret', 'ability.The', 'pacing', 'was', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'along', 'very', 'quickly', 'may', 'leave', 'lot', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'also', 'never', 'dragging', 'score', 'well', 'done', 'there', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'songs', 'create', 'real', 'soundtrack', 'make', 'up', 'moving', 'location', 'location', 'amazing', 'cinematography.And', 'let', 'tell', 'sets', 'are', 'amazing', 'camera', 'work', 'top', 'Big', 'Ben', 'Sphinx', 'Pyramids', 'was', 'amazing', 'wide', 'shots', 'alone', 'worth', 'seeing', 'theatres', 'was', 'so', 'jealous', 'guy', 'could', 'go', 'wherever', 'wanted', 'Europe', 'Africa', 'Asia', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'DVD', 'find', 'out', 'locations', 'were', 'shot', 'set', 'were', 'created', 'CGI', 'other', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'impressive', 'well', 'see', 'residue', 'jumper', 'teleport', 'paladins', 'also', 'have', 'own', 'tools', 'are', 'perhaps', 'not', 'cool', 'also', 'amazing', 'couple', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'peppered', 'in.The', 'movie', 'end', 'very', 'quickly', 'clearly', 'based', 'plot', 'designed', 'sequels', 'story', 'lot', 'loose', 'ends', 'Still', 'one', 'would', 'gladly', 'subject', 'sequel', 'even', 'look', 'forward', 'one.If', 'want', 'realism', 'going', 'see', 'fantasy', 'thriller', ""n't"", 'going', 'give', 'want', 'fun', 'love', 'science', 'fiction', 'comics', 'movie', 'fun', 'watch.Enjoy']",Jumper

Unless it was some artistic endeavor that happened to step into the world of sci fi, it was scoffed at. That's okay though. While critics dismiss these films of fancy, fans follow them non stop. Such may be the case with this week's release, JUMPER.Hayden Christensen stars as David Rice, a young man who comes from a dysfunctional home where mom took off when he was 5 and dad has clung more to the bottle than David. As he hits teen years, David discovers accidentally that he has a strange ability. David can transport himself from one location to another with the speed of thought.Leaving home, David does what any normal male teen would do. He sets himself up in a cheap hotel and transports himself into a bank vault where he takes money that no one notices until months later. No security breach, no alarms, just missing money. The film progresses from there to David grown into a young man, still transporting from locale to locale, have lunch on the head of the Sphinx, appearing immediately in Paris or stepping out to shop in New York only to hit the stores in London. With the speed of thought, David appears.All seems fine until someone appears in David's apartment. That someone is Roland (Samuel L. Jackson) who has shown up to take David down and has the ability (with the help of an electronically charged weapon). With a bit of luck and ingenuity, David escapes and returns to his boyhood home.Once there, David decides to look up the love of his life, the girl who was there when this power first manifested and who hasn't seen him since believing he died, drowned when he was young. Millie (Rachel Bilson) has grown, works in a local bar and still captures David's heart. Taking a chance, he convinces Millie to leave with him to see Rome, a location she's always dreamed of seeing.It is in Rome that David encounters Griffin (Jamie Bell), another ""jumper"" who enlightens David. It seems that Roland is the head of an organization called Paladins that have tracked down and killed ""jumpers"" from the beginning of time. Their goal is simple to exterminate.Realizing he has put Millie in danger, David tries to escape Roland and his cohorts. But the chances of Millie and David making it out safely are slim to none, even with the reluctant aid of Griffin.A final showdown, the appearance of David's mother and more highlight this action packed sci fi tale that offers hot locals, fantastic effects, great looking shots and a plausible story that features good guys and bad on the move. The film is not LAWRENCE OF ARABIA but then it never sets out to be that.Lost in the release schedules of blockbuster films, JUMPER is a solid film that most renters will enjoy.

1156109,AAW58LG72PG7I,B00177Y9ZC,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[1, 4]","In JUMPERS, the viewer is asked to believe that the hero (Hayden Christianson) has the power to teleport himself instantly to any point in the world merely by thinking of doing so. Now I have no problem with the underlying concept of this or any other science fiction story, but regardless of the improbability of the plot, I expect the script to respect the intelligence of the viewer or at least his memory by not violating previously accepted facts in the film.  In JUMPERS, the script fails on both counts.What we are expected to believe is that a race of teleporters called ""Jumpers"" has existed for millenia and that a second group called ""Paladins"" exists only to kill them. Now if this sounds like a rehash of HIGHLANDERS I can accept that but at least with HIGHLANDERS there was a history and a plausible explanation given for the need to kill the immortals. Here, the Paladins led by a one note Samuel Jackson are a group of religious fanatics whose only justification for the killing is that ""Only God should have the power to be everywhere at once.""  The plot revolves around a montage of visual escapes that takes the Jumpers and the pursuing Paladins through the Sphinx, Mount Everest, the Coloseum in Rome, Hong Kong, the North Pole and so many other well-known locations that the viewer has difficulty grasping how that particular jump spot fits into the film's plot in any meaningful way.  The answer. of course, is that it does not and that is why viewer interest and film credibility is soon lost.  Further, the acting is second rate. Diane Lane is wasted in a walk on as Christianson's mother and her explanation of who her son is makes less sense than who she is.

1156112,A22JG2WG04EJSL,B00177Y9ZC,Matthew Moses,"[1, 1]","There is little that can up your enjoyment of a terrible film like seeing it on an airplane. Having sat unbored through the execrable Mad Money on the way out to Seattle, I was actually looking forward to seeing this on the way home, knowing it was coming by having of course perused my Hemispheres free in-fight magazine on the trip out. I also had a quite mild desire to see it when it was in theaters.Okay, so we begin with baby Darth Vader Hayden Christenson atop the pyramids, saying ""Once I was a normal person, a chump, just like you."" That's what I like, a movie that insults its audience right off the bat. Turns out Hayden [his character is David] was only a chump until he was 15, when he presented high school sweetheart Millie with a snow globe. The local bully takes it and throws it out onto the frozen river, and when Hayden goes out to retrieve it, he falls in. It's looking all Omen II for him, when suddenly he finds himself in the local library, which is when I discovered that all of this is taking place in Ann Arbor, where I lived from the ages of 18-30. Hayden's mother abandoned the family at five, and his father is a jerk, so he runs away, by bus [when you can teleport in style?] to NYC, where he soon uses his abilities to rob a bank. When next we see him, he's in his 20s and living in a swank apartment in New York, where he uses his abilities to even do such small things as reach a DVD cover that is a foot out of reach. Amazingly, for as physically lazy as he apparently is, he's quite fit.In here we are also introduced to Samuel Jackson as Roland, who is a Paladin, a group of people who hunt and kill Jumpers [as the teleportees are known] because they are ""religious zealots"" who believe that ""Only God should have that power."" Sound like a flimsy excuse for a villain? Just asking.For no specific reason, Hayden suddenly gets a jones to see his old high school sweetheart. I say move on with your life, Hayden, there are plenty of other fish in the sea, but he's been established as somewhat of softie, who stupidly leaves handwritten IOU's at the banks he steals from. Now, is he ever REALLY going to pay that money back? Anyway, he goes back to Ann Arbor and finds Millie working as a waitress. She has grown up to quite a hottie in the Avril Lavigne mold, all tight tanks and eye liner. Also there is the town bully, and they get in a fight before Hayden teleports him somewhere and satisfyingly freaks him way the hell out. Then he's back and offers Millie a spontaneous trip to Rome, where she's always wanted to go, and she says sure.So they go to Rome--by airplane! Poor Hayden. That must have been a pain. Millie knows Hayden is lying about where all his money comes from, but is okay with a don't ask, don't tell policy. So after a few days they end up at the Coliseum, which has been Millie's ""Number One"" sight to see for ever [since that first magical viewing of Gladiator, perhaps?]. However, despite it being her top priority, they have wasted a few days in Rome before getting around to it, and arrive precisely at closing time. Hayden uses his powers to get her in after hours, whereupon he happens upon another Jumper, who warns him about a coming Paladin attack, which arrives post haste. Hayden is all stupid and getting zapped [the Paladins use these super tazers which supposedly inhibits a Jumper's ability to jump], while the other Jumper is doing the only sensible thing, and appearing behind one of the Paladins long enough to bash them with a baseball bat. Anyway, Hayden gets arrested, and various authorities, of both real and shadowy supernatural government agencies, are on his tail.Around this time my traveling companion, who had been watching the movie as well, leaned over to me and said ""Does this movie make any sense at all?"" To which I had to reply that no, it did not. It's just this arbitrary conceit with these arbitrary rules [never fully articulated], for the sole purpose of staging fights and chases that range across numerous locations. These fights and chases are, however, pretty darn cool, once you get past the whole this-is-the-stupidest-thing-ever-set-to-celluloid barrier, and if you have elected to enhance your viewing through one of the many forms of available mind-altering substances, now is when you really want to let that stuff fly, because here's where the movie becomes a bit of a pip in spite of itself.SPOILERS > > >So turns out that Jackson and his Paladin cru are going to kill everyone Hayden cares about in order to get to him, which they demonstrate without harm to Hayden by killing his dad. Hayden has eight hours to kill Roland before Millie's plane back from Rome--alone--lands, which I thought was an okay excuse to give us a tight time frame, although the filmmakers blow it off almost immediately. Hayden suggests that he and Griffin, the other Jumper, team up, and after a while they do. Hayden goes to Millie's apartment, where Roland is in the process of sneaking into, and jumps with her to the jumper hideout. BUT! Roland has a special machine that ""detects recently-opened wormholes,"" and allows him to jump there, too! This leads to the first of a few of the cool fights that range throughout a bunch of locations around the world. Griffin also has the ability to jump with objects, so at one point Roland finds himself atop Mount Everest with a London double-decker bus suddenly bearing down on him from the sky. It's all amusingly cool, but you WILL have time to ask yourself why none of these idiotic jumpers don't simply buy a GUN, appear behind the Paladin, and clock them. I suppose somewhere on the DVD there's a bit about how despite the fights, public-threatening crashes, stabbing and electro-torture, they wanted to send a strong anti gun violence message.For a rather cool finish, Hayden, who appears to be enmeshed in Roland's super-snare, relocates Millie's entire apartment into a river, and then into the Ann Arbor public library. He leaves Roland in a cave on a sheer cliff face.There's a short coda, useful only in setting up a sequel [which I thought was ludicrous, until I read today that two sequels have been approved] in which we find out that Hayden's mother is a Paladin, and is going to come hunting for him at some point. Millie has fully adjusted to the jumper lifestyle and is just chillin' with her man. The end.&lt; &lt; &lt; SPOILERS ENDIt's delightfully senseless, and doesn't even stick to the rules it establishes [when it makes the effort to establish rules, which isn't often], but all of this is trumped by the fact that those multi-location fights and chases are pretty cool. The kindest review I can give it is that if it was on cable [and I HAD cable] I would probably watch the last half again.",2,"Does this movie make any sense?""",1213056000,"06 10,

The premise of Jumpers and what they can do is pretty cool, so I was geared for a fun sci-fi film. Jumpers are the only people with special abilities (at least, as far as the movie showed) - no other abilities such as making fire or telekinesis or anything.What made me give this movie such a low rating was this... rivalry between Jumpers and Paladins (people who hunt down and destroy Jumpers) Why? The Paladins are supposed to be these religious nutjobs who think that Jumpers are abominations against God. This has been going on since the Middle Ages.Wait, what? Today, they can capture Jumpers by shocking them with electricity because that interferes with a Jumper's ability to Jump, but in the Middle Ages, they had no such devices. Infact, the origin and history of Jumpers and Paladins are never really explained. It's not explained how Paladins were able to kill Jumpers back then. So honestly, the whole story really makes no sense, and this movie would have been a lot better if taken in a different direction.The protagonist's mom left when he was five.

They don't have any fear, don't have any comprehension of the worries that plague us all when we travel, or go out alone at night. In Jumper, there's a new category of world traveler: the superhero.Jumpers, you see, are teleporters.  They can teleport anywhere they've seen and they leave jumpscars - dimensional portals - open for a minute or so after they jump.  If you're fast, you can jump in after them.That's all you need to know about Jumper, and that's all Jumper is going to share with you.  There are no details behind teleportation (hint: according to modern scientific theory, if you can teleport you can time travel). Filling the role of villain is a shadowy government agency known as Paladins who have figured out how to anchor Jumpers by lassoing them with electrified nets.  They believe that Jumpers are a threat to mankind and see the ability to jump as religious blasphemy - kind of unnecessary, really, as you can imagine that any government agency would be plenty terrified of Jumpers without all the Biblical angst.But anyway, that's the premise of Jumper: boy meets girl, boy learns to teleport, government agency tries to kill boy, boy meets girl again, repeat until somebody dies.  Only nobody dies.Jumper has to be the most attractively hollow movie I've seen in a while.  Nothing is resolved. Good guy David Rice (Hayden Christensen, broodingly bland as ever) doesn't ever really learn his lesson, Paladin-hunter Griffin (the far more interesting Jamie Bell) is left in limbo, love interest Millie (also bland Rachel Bilson) doesn't deal with the consequences of a romance with a Jumper, and even archvillain Roland (Samuel L. Jackson with crazy white hair) isn't permanently defeated.  The big reveal about Rice's past has no impact on the plot at all since it's revealed in the last five minutes of the film.And that's a shame.  Jumpers are weird folks.  They don't need to worry about money, or responsibility, or fear of death.  They just jump away to some other place.  Do that enough and you start to get a little weird.  A relationship for a Jumper has to be quite strange, especially with someone who can't jump - I imagine Jumpers regularly order food and never pay for it, steal clothes and just walk out of the store, and travel all over the globe at a whim...but there only hints of any of this in Jumper.

1156121,A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ,B00177Y9ZC,Michael K. Smith,"[2, 3]","In 1992, Steven Gould published his first novel, called _Jumper_, which was an immediate success and has remained popular since. In 2004, he published a sequel, _Reflex_, which, like many sequels, wasn't nearly as good -- though it wasn't really bad. Then, in 2007, as the long-awaited film version was underway, Gould rewrote the story more cinematically and published it as _Jumper: Griffin's Story_. You would think at least one of those would be the basis for the movie, right? Nope. Only a few points are carried over from the page to the screen: from the first book, the character's name and the fact that he robs a bank. (In the book, it was done in desperation because he was too young to get a job in the big city; in the film, he does it almost as a lark, just because he can.) From the sequel comes the notion that there exists a secret society of teleport-hunters who will stop at nothing to exterminate them. (In the book, no real reason is given for their murderous crusade; in the film, it's merely attributed to ""religious fanaticism,"" with no explanation of what's ""religious"" about it.) The plot, you should excuse the expression, jumps all over the place, painting David Rice as a not very sympathetic slacker with too much money. Hayden Christensen isn't very believable, being much too old for the role, and Samuel L. Jackson as the Bad Guy is painful to watch. Jamie Bell is somewhat better as the rather nihilistic Brit, Griffin, taken (sort of) from the third novel. And the character of David's mother, played by Diane Lane, makes no sense at all: She's a committed teleport-killer, but she's protecting her teleport son? But she still hasn't changed her mind about the necessity of wiping them out -- so she just wishes him luck? Gimme a break.

1156123,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B00177Y9ZC,Micheal Hunt,"[1, 1]","With all the talk I heard about this DVD, it seems that it might just be fans of Anikin Skywalker's just loving him being in another movie that I did not feel was as good as the hype being said about it.Jumper is about a boy who one day discovers he can warp/teleport. He decides to use this power to take money from a few bank vaults and live a life of luxury. However his plan backfires when he finds out that he is not the only person who can do this trick. They are called Jumpers, and can warp to wherever they want to. He could be in New York city one minute and then warp straight to the Sphinx in Egypt.While discovering he is not alone, he also finds out there are (some name for it) a group of people who want to kill them for having this ability to jump wherever they want to. The plot pretty much goes around him trying to stay alive while protecting his girlfriend and learning to be a jumper.It sounds pretty cool when you hear the plot story, but I feel this movie could have been so much better then it is. I really did not like the idea that he just figures out he can do this, like it's genetics and he accidentally discovers he can warp. I know this is just a movie for entertainment, but even in a non fiction world, you want some sort of explanation to what causes this. I'd have bought into a magic ring, or an ancient crystal that gives them these powers, but to just have him figure it out like he was born with it just did not feel like it was the right way to give him these powers.Also, they should have explored the fun you could have with such powers. It seems like he just decides to rob bank vaults, and uses it to warp to a few places... if you had that kind of power, the first thing that comes to mind is probably not rob a bank vault, you'd probably be testing it to see what you can do, and how much of it. There is plenty of things they could have tried to make it seem like someone who really did have this power and could do anything, there where so many possibilities they could have explored.The battles between the jumpers and whatever they where did not seem to be thought out as well as it should. There is no explanation as to why jumpers are being killed, apart from jealousy from a religious type of hunter group.So many possibilities where unexplored, and so many reasons and ""whys""left unanswered.Many people are saying this is an original concept. No it's not. This seems like they have taken ideas from ""Click"" and ""TimeCop"" and mixed it with a lot of concepts you see from b-grade horror movies and wrapped it up in a normal human being who is not from hell or has a thirst for blood.It's just usually you see these warp things in demons, or evil, aliens or angels or gods or something, so it's not an original concept, just the idea to put it into someone normal, but far from original, as there have been movies made where a normal person can do this kind of thing.Overall I think they could have done a much better job with this story wise. It came off feeling pretty average and so many questions left unanswered. And if that is a set up for a sequel, then this series has already failed for doing it on purpose before they know if the movie was a success or not... people aren't as stupid as the movie companies want them to be.the extras seemed pretty boring. So I expect there holding back a few months before the release a special directors cut edition, which will fail the market as people either refuse to buy it, or copy it or download it... and the movie companies wonder why piracy is running rampart these days.Overall, fans of Anikin will flock over this and praise it, no matter what he is in. but to the average viewer, this is a pretty average movie that could have been done so much better if it focused more on entertainment then the FX of the movie.2 and half stars from me.",3,Overhyped,1214956800,"07 2, 2008",2008,3847,"['talk', 'heard', 'DVD', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'fans', 'Anikin', 'Skywalker', 'just', 'loving', 'being', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'hype', 'being', 'said', 'it.Jumper', 'boy', 'who', 'one', 'day', 'can', 'warp/teleport', 'use', 'power', 'take', 'money', 'few', 'bank', 'vaults', 'live', 'life', 'luxury', 'However', 'plan', 'when', 'out', 'not', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'trick', 'are', 'called', 'Jumpers', 'can', 'warp', 'wherever', 'want', 'could', 'be', 'New', 'York', 'city', 'one', 'minute', 'then', 'warp', 'straight', 'Sphinx', 'Egypt.While', 'discovering', 'not', 'alone', 'also', 'out', 'are', 'name', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'kill', 'having', 'ability', 'jump', 'wherever', 'want', 'plot', 'pretty', 'much', 'trying', 'stay', 'alive', 'protecting', 'girlfriend', 'learning', 'be', 'jumper.It', 'pretty', 'cool', 'when', 'hear', 'plot', 'story', 'feel', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'then', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'idea', 'just', 'out', 'can', 'do', 'genetics', 'accidentally', 'can', 'warp', 'know', 'just', 'movie', 'entertainment', 'even', 'non', 'fiction', 'world', 'want', 'sort', 'explanation', 'what', ""'d"", 'have', 'bought', 'magic', 'ring', 'ancient', 'crystal', 'powers', 'just', 'have', 'figure', 'out', 'was', 'born', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'was', 'right', 'way', 'give', 'powers.Also', 'should', 'have', 'explored', 'fun', 'could', 'have', 'such', 'powers', 'just', 'rob', 'bank', 'vaults', 'warp', 'few', 'places', 'had', 'kind', 'power', 'first', 'thing', 'mind', 'probably', 'not', 'rob', 'bank', 'vault', ""'d"", 'probably', 'be', 'testing', 'see', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'how', 'much', 'plenty', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'tried', 'make', 'seem', 'someone', 'who', 'really', 'did', 'have', 'power', 'could', 'do', 'anything', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'possibilities', 'could', 'have', 'explored.The', 'battles', 'jumpers', 'whatever', 'where', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'thought', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'should', 'explanation', 'why', 'jumpers', 'are', 'being', 'killed', 'apart', 'jealousy', 'religious', 'type', 'hunter', 'group.So', 'many', 'possibilities', 'where', 'unexplored', 'so', 'many', 'reasons', 'whys', 'left', 'unanswered.Many', 'people', 'are', 'saying', 'original', 'concept', 'not', 'have', 'taken', 'ideas', 'Click', 'TimeCop', 'mixed', 'lot', 'concepts', 'see', 'b-grade', 'horror', 'movies', 'wrapped', 'up', 'normal', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'not', 'hell', 'thirst', 'blood.It', 'just', 'usually', 'see', 'warp', 'things', 'demons', 'evil', 'aliens', 'angels', 'gods', 'something', 'not', 'original', 'concept', 'just', 'idea', 'put', 'someone', 'normal', 'far', 'original', 'have', 'been', 'movies', 'made', 'where', 'normal', 'person', 'can', 'do', 'kind', 'thing.Overall', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'story', 'wise', 'came', 'off', 'feeling', 'pretty', 'average', 'so', 'many', 'questions', 'left', 'unanswered', 'set', 'up', 'sequel', 'then', 'series', 'already', 'failed', 'doing', 'purpose', 'know', 'movie', 'was', 'success', 'not', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'stupid', 'movie', 'companies', 'want', 'be.the', 'extras', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'boring', 'So', 'expect', 'holding', 'back', 'few', 'months', 'release', 'special', 'directors', 'cut', 'edition', 'will', 'fail', 'market', 'people', 'refuse', 'buy', 'copy', 'download', 'movie', 'companies', 'wonder', 'why', 'piracy', 'running', 'rampart', 'days.Overall', 'fans', 'Anikin', 'will', 'flock', 'praise', 'matter', 'what', 'average', 'viewer', 'pretty', 'average', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'focused', 'more', 'entertainment', 'then', 'FX', 'movie.2', 'half', 'stars']",Jumper

I'm also very tolerant and forgiving as a movie fan -- invariably, I find something at least resonably worthwhile, or at least entertaining, about a movie.  Not so ""Jumpers"".  It really takes quite an awful movie to actually make me regret the ticket expense -- what's a few dollars for 90 minutes of big-screen entertainment, right?  Wrong.  As other reviewers have alluded to, ""Jumpers"" is simply a title (and some none-too-special special effects) in search of a plot, even the vestiges of continuity and logic, and any engagement with the audience at all.  It fails - miserably - on all three counts.  The acting is amateurish at best, the plot holes are large enough to navigate an oil tanker through, and the saddest loss of all is Samuel L. Jackson's ridiculous character and performance -- other than his paycheck, which I'm sure he happily deposited as he laughed all the way to the bank, it was a waste of a competent actor's talents.  As for the rest of the cast, the less said, the better.But this isn't even my main gripe with this film -- there are certainly many ""action flicks"" that have disastrously bad acting and even a plot hole or three, yet they still can entertain.  Not ""Jumpers"".  Even if one forgives the utter lack of explanation and background story behind the origins of the ""Jumpers"" and the ""Paladins"", there could still have been a cohesive plot that actually progressed toward some logical conclusion.  Instead, what we have here is a non-stop chase sequence and travelogue of places throughout the world (including, ludicrously, the top of the Egyptian Sphinx's head, apparently a frequent lunch spot for our hero), a ridiculous ""plot"" about an age-old conflict between two groups that the world at large doesn't know exist, and...let's see, and...  I guess that's it.  Really,  There's NOTHING else to this movie.  And, irony of ironies, the most ridiculous moment comes near the end (I won't give anything away here, in case you still insist on wasting your time and money on this) -- the story gets left wide-open for a SEQUEL!!

1156131,AYBL30P5NXNZ4,B00177Y9ZC,"Mr. Stephen Kennedy ""skenn1701a""","[1, 1]","An interesting story, brought together by interesting talent, falls oddly short of expectations in this action movie with fantasy elements.The stall is set out early, as an intro shows Hayden Christensen discovering his ability to teleport (jump) from place to place.  He indulges himself with his ability, leaving behind the love of his teen life and living in style, until he meets another Jumper, played by Jamie Bell.  They are tracked by the Paladin, a secret group led by Samuel Jackson who are hell bent on destroying Jumpers.  And that's really about it - and I don't mean that I am saving the rest of the plot to avoid writing spoilers - that really is about it, it really devolves into a `does-he-get-the-girl' movie at this point, winding up after a scant 84 minutes, seemingly in the middle of the story.  Why do the Paladin want to destroy Jumpers?  Will Christensen achieve his stated goal of destroying the oddly coiffured Jackson character?  What makes the Jumpers what they are?  How many are there?  Will Christensen's character ever come out of his permanent sulk?  All remain unanswered - presumably for the inevitable sequel.Hayden Christensen does little here to dispel notions that his acting is on a par with your nearest oak tree, but Jamie Bell is interestingly edgy and has the benefit of the films few humorous moments.  Bilson looks terrific of course but really has little to do once the special effects starts, and Jackson is really only going through the motions.  None of this really matters with such thinly drawn characters, and the director smooths over the cracks with his efficient action scenes.  The movie does crackle along with innovative set pieces which pique the interest, ultimately however leaving you all the more unfulfilled at the (partly literally) cliffhanger ending.Overall, you're left with the feeling that as much as there is to like, this would have been much better edited down to a 20 minute introduction to a much more interesting and complex film.

However, Doug Liman's adaptation of Steven Gould's novel ends up being anything but, and is nowhere near as fun or enjoyable as it could have been.  Hayden Christensen broods his way all over the screen as David Rice, a man with the ability to teleport anywhere in the world just by thinking it.  He's pretty much enjoying life, until meeting fellow ""jumper"" Griffin (Jamie Bell) and learning that there has been a centuries long war between the jumpers and the Paladins, of which is Roland (a blonde haired Samuel L. Jackson) who will stop at nothing to put an end to David.  Christensen is just so stiff and unconvincing in the lead role that watching him becomes a plain bore.  In fact, the cast as a whole just comes off that way, including Jackson, and wasted roles for Diane Lane, Kristen Stewart, Tom Hulce, Michael Rooker, and Rachel Bilson as David's love interest.  Jamie Bell on the other hand is so good that the Amazon review stating that one will wish both he and Christensen had switched roles could not be further from the truth.  Liman's direction is frentic to be sure, but the special effects sequences are surprisingly disappointing to behold.  Considering Jumper's troubled production history, none of this really comes off as much of a surprise, but the potential was here to have an incredibly fun time that just gets basically wasted.

I mean, when you see the Hayden Christensen character 'David' living in his terrific bachelor pad, it would've been sooo nice to see him actually getting it and seeing him buy all the stuff that's in it.  I mean, for a story like this, it's just as much as the journey as it is anything else.  It's like when someone wins the lottery, it's a cool thing to get to see them enjoy their winnings.That, to me is what's missing with the movie Jumper.  I mean, here this character has the most incredible gift, and you never really see him use it for fun stuff.  I mean, like there's this part when he and the girl he's trying to impress are in Rome and then they are found to be trespassing and then the police arrive.  I mean, where in the screenplay could the David character NOT jump to save himself (and the girl)?  I mean, to see that kind of escape would've been sooo cool!  But then he allows himself to get arrested/detained which only serves as a plot device so that his mother (Diane Lane) can come to his rescue.And the whole thing with the Paladins?  That seems kinda out there.  Because the people who are 'Jumpers' aren't really bad people.  If anything the Paladins seem like the bad guys because they want to kill these people who have this really cool ability--like maybe they're all suffering from 'Jumper Envy'.Either way, I think the premise for Jumper was cool.

He inadvertently discovers this while trying to escape drowning in an ice-covered lake.Flash forward several years, and this boy, named David Rice (Hayden Christensen), is now in his 20's and is living a hedonistic, but low-key, lifestyle based on his ability to teleport in and out of banks without notice and make off with a fortune.  While most of the populace have no clue that this is happening, Roland Cox (Samuel L. Jackson), of a collective called the Paladins, has tracked David down.  It seems the Paladins goal to strike back against and exterminate all of these 'Jumpers'.On the surface, this seems like there could be a very impressive contest of wills and skills between David and Roland.  Unfortunately, the promise is wasted on a relatively pedestrian plot.  Yes, there are battles between the two sides and travels exotic locales.  However, the intensity never rises above a low-grade fever.  Normally, cinematic whipping boy, Hayden Christensen, would take the fall for something like this.  However, he holds up his end just fine.  The fault lies with the uninspired direction of Doug Liman.

He's now a world wide playboy jumping to multiple countries and playing the field.  Enter our arch enemy the ""CIA"" operative Roland Cox (Samuel L.

There were four of us watching this last weekend, and only 3 remained conscious until the end... of those 3 all of us kind of shrugged and one said ""well that was certainly another ho-hum movie.""None of us had read the book or graphic novel that this was based off of.  Perhaps if we had then we would have enjoyed it more.  When the movie started up with the voice over I knew we were in trouble.  Very few ""good"" movies have VO's (Christmas Story is a good one, Trainspotting another.)  VO's generally tell you that ""we can't write a good script so we're going to have some guy tell you what you're supposed to know.""  I tried to ignore the VO and give the movie a chance... then we were treated to excellent actors forgetting to act.  They were all very stiff, wooden, and clich&eacute;d.  Samuel L Jackson looked absolutely ridiculous with his white hair and tazer-club.  When the plot was supposed to shift into high gear... nothing was explained.  Okay so the bad guys were called ""Paladins"" and had been killing ""Jumpers"" since forever because they were too powerful.  Um... okay.  Too bad the ""Jumpers"" in this movie never really acted like good guys.  I didn't particularly care who lived or died... in fact I would have been much happier had they all died.So let's forget about the lack of a good script, plot holes, and bad acting.  What about the SFX?  Some of them were quite good, and some of them were Sci-Fi channel special quality.  Some of it was ingenious and some of it was garbage, but there was little consistency to what we saw and when.  Sometimes when he jumped, the buildings shook and the walls cracked... other times he was able to hop all over the place without making a sound.All I know is that by the time the final battle came around we were all ready for this to be over.

Jackson as the NSA Specialist charged with finding and stopping all of David's breed, ""Jumper"" makes so many Bad Movie mistakes that it's impossible to know where to begin describing it - or to recommend it.Across the board, it's definitely one of the most underdeveloped films I've ever sat through: clearly, the cast isn't going to be putting on Shakespeare anytime soon (Christiansen, Jamie Bell and the horrific Avril Lavigne clone that plays the whiney, ungrateful ""love"" interest Millie all give dreadfully hammy, two-dimensional performances, and Samuel L Jackson overacts like Faye Dunaway with a wire hanger), and the basic plot is just that: very, very basic (good guy triumphs over school bullies and dissatisfactory home life, goes on to triumph over evil governmental agency, leaves end WIIIIDE OPEN for many sequels). The script could have been written in crayons by a three-year-old (and not a bright three-year old, at that), and it's full of boring dialogue and uninteresting clich&eacute;. And the direction, for the most part, reflects the cast and the script: it's not memorable, and it's not entertaining.So why, when 90% of the movie's elements are either badly put-together (the introduction of the adult Millie is just one scene where this movie looks and feels like a malformed cross between ""The O.C."" and ""Charmed""), did the director not keep the audience focused on the one area where this movie excels: action? The special effect sequences, at least on the big screen, are interesting, and some of the action scenes are very exciting.But before you know it, those good parts are over - and for a movie whose plot centres on action, there's not very many of them to begin with - and we're once more thrust back into the mess of bad acting, bad scripting and boring story that make up the majority of ""Jumper"".Personally, this would have worked better as a film about knitwear.... ...but whatever. If you have to see this one, see it in theatres: it needs a big screen to be impressive.

This film could have definitely benefitted from more of her. It felt like there was probably more material with her in it, but for some reason it was cut from the finish product. If I remember correctly, the movie clocked in at under 90 minutes so I don't see why we couldn't have had a little more of Diane. In fact, when it was all said and done, it felt like the movie was shorter than it had originally intended to be which is probably why I was left unfulfilled.

They are quite good, although nothing we haven't seen before (remember the first time you saw the original Star Wars and Jurassic Park? - Wow!). Of course the film relies heavily on CGI and I'm sure green screen was extensively used, although I couldn't tell what was real and what was green screen (I can usually tell).Second, I really liked the idea behind the whole story of the Jumpers and the Paladins. With such an interesting idea, one would have expected the story to go a little further than it did and delve deeper into the origins of both sides of the ""war"", but I got the feeling that this was just an ""introductory film"" that would lead to numerous sequels (it's Hollywood - what did you expect?). The film does indeed, leave the story WIDE open for sequels galore.Finally, the acting was substandard in my opinion. I did like the Star Wars prequel films, but I never did like Hayden Christensen's performances. They were wooden, dull, and just plain uninteresting. The same goes for ""Jumper"". He is a good-looking and resonably fit individual and I'm sure that appeals to the young ladies and gives them incentive to go to the theaters, but his acting skills are just plain awful. He just doesn't have the acting skills to carry a lead role.Racheal Bilson's (sorry if I spelled her name incorrectly) performance is just as bad as Christiansen's. Both actors deliver shallow performances and portray shallow characters. Sam Jackson was as good as he could be with the role he was given, but overall, I just wasn't able to establish an emotional connection with them and therefore really didn't care how things turned out for them.To sum up, the story and special effects are pretty decent and will keep you entertained for a couple fo hours, but don't expect any riveting performances or thought-provoking commentary about the human condition.

Jackson as Roland Cox,Jamie Bell as Griffin,Diane Lane as Mary Rice,and others.This Doug Liman directed film is an uneven effort,which never seems to build up any steam for any length of time,thus losing the interest of the viewer very quickly.The film opens as a younger David Rice is in high school.A bully throws a snow globe onto some ice,which David retrieves.However the ice gives way and the current pulls him under.Just as he is about to drown he teleports himself into the local library.From here he tries to understand his new found abilities.He runs away from home and goes to live in New York where he robs banks in order to survive on his own.years pass and it seems his jumping has not gone unnoticed,as one Roland Cox is the head of an agency that tracks and kills jumpers.On a return trip to his apartment he is confronted by Cox who tries to rope him with steel cables which are electrified,to prevent him from jumping.He barely manages to get away and flees home.He meets up with his old flame whom he escorts to Rome.While in the Coliseum he meets up with another jumper called Griffin.He explains the folks after him are Paladins(have gun will travel?),an ancient order dedicated to wiping out all jumpers.In short order the two confront two such men,but escape.They escape the Paladins,but not the local police who arrest David.While in jail his mother visits him and releases him.He takes his girlfriend to the airport and she flies home alone.David and Griffin form a brief partnership to get Cox.Meanwhile Cox has attempted to kill David's father,who he finds and takes to a hospital.David then returns to his girlfriend and snatches her away to Griffins hideaway.But jumpers leave slight openings which Cox uses to find them with.A fight ensues resulting in Millie's capture.David returns to her but is captured.He teleports part of the building to the river in which he almost drowned in years before,then back to the library.However Cox has been pulled along with him and he teleports him to a remote cave above the Grand Canyon.The film ends as David visits his mother and she explains she is in fact a Paladin also,and gives him a head start.David and Millie jump to a destination unknown.The film ends abruptly and I thought there was more coming when it did.There are a ton of unanswered questions in this film,the least of which is David's mother.It appeared to me she was also a jumper,but she turns out to be a Paladin too,who normally don't have that ability.David apparently first jumped at five,but for some unknown reason doesn't remember that.What five year old wouldn't recall such a thing when he grew up? At one point the older David is looking at a TV new story about people stranded in a river atop a car,with the reporter questioning as to how they could be rescued.I thought the next scene would be David jumping there to at least do SOME good,instead of just taking(money)and living off the avails of others.But the film just breezes past it.The questions go on and on.As said previously it is a hodge podge of a film that never leaves you invested in the characters for any length of time whatsoever.Even the wonderful filming locales such as Rome or in Egypt couldn't make up for the interest loss.It's as if the filmmakers didn't have much of a vested interest in making it the film themselves,which translated into apathy on screen.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1.Extras include:commentary,an animated graphic novel of Davids story,three featurettes and some deleted scenes.This two disc set contains the film disc and extras and a digital copy.All in all a film with lots of potential but with a lacklustre script and execution by its makers.You soon lose any interest in the characters,which inevitably will sink a film faster than a cement block in the Hudson.2 1/2 -

Obviously working below his pay-grade here, Samuel L. Jackson plays Roland, the leader of a group of religious fanatics who, believing only God should have the power to be in more than one place at a time, roam the earth seeking out and destroying all the jumpers they can get their hands on.Essentially a travelogue masquerading as a thriller, ""Jumper"" takes a reasonably promising premise and turns it into inane wish-fulfillment drivel.  There are more holes in the plot than there are wormholes for the jumpers to pass through, and the final action sequences border on the incoherent.  The movie mistakes hectic activity for excitement and leaves most of its earnest performers stranded high and dry with little to do but play second fiddle to all the hyper-kinetic visuals and special effects going on around them (the gifted Diane Lane, in particular, is woefully wasted as the mother who abandoned David when he was five).  Ah well, at least they got a few all-expenses-paid trips to some of the world's most prestigious locales as compensation.Indeed, the one redeeming grace is that the movie takes us to a number of highly photogenic tourist spots around the globe, from the Empire State Building to the pyramids at Giza to, most memorably, the Coliseum in Rome.

But not before a romantic angle is tossed in as David takes his high-school girlfriend out to Rome for a swing -- they fly regular Northwest of course, despite the hunt on for his arrest at NSA level.The plot holes are large enough for obese teleporters to jump through. Christensen, an actor chosen clearly to appeal to the younger Star Wars fans, would have done well to consider a repertoire of at least two facial expressions. The final 15 minutes or so have so much rammed into them, with pulse-pounding heavy metal music of course, that one wonders if the film was about to overrun its deadline and had to be chip-chopped in a rush.The loud hints at the end suggest that there might be a Jumper II. Optimistic as that may be, one hopes they will rope in someone else to write, direct, act in, and score it.

Okay, not exactly the same, but comparing those two is a good way to show everything that was wrong with Jumper.The concept is fine, but the execution was sorely lacking.  There's no character development because so much time is covered over the course of the movie.  We get no insight into the main character's thoughts, motivations, or personality.  He comes off as shallow and two-dimensional.  He goes from scared kid to conscienceless, arrogant jerk in ten minutes.  There's never any question or delving into whether what he's doing is right or wrong (he's a thief, plain and simple) or how he could use his power for good instead of just wasting it.  Granted, who wouldn't want to gallivant about the world, carefree, I suppose, but the moral struggle would be very much a part of the character.Unlike in Sliders, the Jumpers have full control over where they go and when.  Still, the TV show format of one or two jumps and an adventure per show would be far more entertaining than this jumbled, boring, barely explained plotline.  Then again, this would require character development and plot.Even the pivotal plot point about the secret organization is boring, focusing on a religious inquisition instead of, oh, upholding the law.  Of all the trite and cheesy story lines (scientific experiments, military uses, etc) this is not only the tritest and cheesiest, but also the most yawn-inducing.Even as a mindless action movie this one fails, unless your aim is to become a brain-dead zombie.

This idea is fresh and clever and filmed with terrific special effects, but the film as a whole is executed so moronically that a great idea is totally wasted.  Hayden Christensen, the lead jumper and Anakin Skywalker in those Star Wars prequels, continues to amaze me with his extraordinary lack of acting ability.  To call him wooden would be a compliment at this point.  Ironically, he thinks (acts?) as if he is enchanting somehow.  In any event, after a life of rejections with his mom, Diane Lane, skipping out on him when he was five and an abusive alcoholic father, Michael Rooker, and the ever overplayed tortured high school experiences where he's treated as a freak, Christensen takes to a life of robbing banks by misusing his ""gift"" of teleporting (aka ""jumping"") and living off the grid as much as possible.Samuel L. Jackson, do I really need to list his credits here, also offers a rather wooden or ""phone in"" performance as Roland who never gives us a solid reason to latch onto as to why he hates jumpers.  Yeah, he says it's because they all go bad at some point and that only God should be in all places, but those reasons ring hollow and don't explain his intense hatred for the jumpers.  He eventually catches up with Christensen's character who must, in order to beat Roland, join forces with another jumper, well-played by Jamie Bell, who is much wiser than he, better with his ability, but extremely anti-social. Bell role is the most interesting and engaging character in the whole film.  Heck, I can't even recall the subplot with Christensen's ""love interest"" in the film.  It's that flat and uninteresting.This film is definitely dedicated to the A.D.D. generation as things move quickly, but don't add up.  There are far too many holes in the plot.  To say this movie is shallow is like saying the desert can be a little dry.  I gave it two stars because the concept was fresh and clever, the effects are fun and different, the dialogue had some witty moments, and the film was mercifully short.  It's what many call mindless entertainment, but entertaining nevertheless.  My family and I had some fun with this movie.  We knew we weren't seeing Shakespeare or anything, therefore, our expectations were low enough that we really didn't leave the theater disappointed.  We kinda got what we expected.Scary Final Note:  The book is one in a series.

After all, this film didn't do all that well in theatres, and from information I had read/heard, the film itself was started and stopped and then restarted again with virtually everything about the film changing in the process.  Basically I expected it to be a bit of a train wreck that likely couldn't live up to the relatively neat promise of the main premise: the star character was someone that found he had the ability to teleport anywhere instantly.Pleasantly enough the movie doesn't do a bad job in delivering a fun ride.  Sure enough, the star does have the ability to teleport anywhere but his ability comes with potential consequences as there are people who believe that no one should have the power and ability that he, or others like him, has and those people will stop at nothing to permanently stop 'jumpers'.Hayden Christensen plays the lead role here with Samuel L. Jackson (with bright white hair) playing the leader of the opposing side.  Christensen does well enough in his role, and Samuel L. Jackson delivers a solid enough performance as well.  Add in reasonable performances from the supporting cast, mix with some action and adventure in the form of good vs. evil fight scenes set in exotic locations and you get a movie that does a reasonable job delivering on the responsibility of being entertaining.  No it's not academy award type stuff, but it's good enough.  Were half star ratings possible, it'd be 3.5 for me.  Without the half star rating system, I'm rounding up to 4 stars.Picture on the Blu-ray disc looks quite nice.  The movie is relatively short, with a somewhat family friendly PG-13 rating which seems mostly related to the action and violence in the fight scenes (and perhaps a little related to a scene that finds the female lead stripping her shirt off...) Little or no objectionable language.Turn your brain off a bit going in and you should find Jumper reasonably entertaining.

1156182,A2QR035HCPBSLC,B00177Y9ZC,"The B ""ahnonamis""","[6, 7]","I remember really looking forward to Jumper when the teaser and initial previews came out. Then, suddenly, the movie was there in front of me on Blu-Ray, and to say I was only a little disappointed would be an understatement.Rather than the big action ride I anticipated, Jumper is instead a showcase for digital effects, camera work, and the power of HD. The movie focuses on people called ""jumpers,"" who are able to teleport. The main character of the film, played by Anakin himself, does what most people would do if they found themselves given such great power: use it for his own gains.Most people will claim if they could teleport they'd use it for good, but let's be honest: a majority of you would use it the same way David Rice does: teleporting to rob banks, but mostly just using it to travel the world instantaneously and fulfill his own cravings. Want Chinese from China? You got it. Want to surf in Fiji but also have a one-night stand in London? You got that, too.Thankfully, the movie isn't just David Rice partaking in vices. Alongside the jumpers, there's a group known as the Paladins, which (if you've ever played any games or D&D;) you can guess are religiously based. Led in the film by Samuel L Jackson, the Paladins make it their duty to extinguish the jumpers, believing only God should have the ability to be anywhere at once.Throw in the clich&eacute; girlfriend childhood love interest, and the stranger who seems bad at first but obviously ends up ""good,"" and you've got Jumper. It's an action film filled with great scenes and spectacular camerawork, but outside of SLJ there's little positive when it comes to performances (and even he seems to have phoned this one in), and even less positive when it comes to plot, development and a sense of closure at the end. There will obviously be a Jumper 2, so we'll have to see if they can do a better job with that one.In terms of the Blu-Ray transfer, Jumper is one of the best discs yet in terms of visual quality. Coming in at 1080p with a 2.35:1 framed image, the film looks much, much better than the plot showcases. Colors are crisp, and several scenes look outright realistic. If you have an HDTV and don't mind the mindless action films from the 80s and earlier, give Jumper a try, if for no other reason to see how awesome films like Predator would have been with this quality of picture.Everything else about Jumper is so-so. The audio is 5.1 but never too outstanding (or too poor), and the extras do the job but little above their requirement. Featured are obvious ones such as the making of the film (which I admit does do a better job than some), a look into the special effects process, and another look at adapting the novel into the film, which is my favorite piece. No matter what you take out of Jumper, it will likely make you interested in author Steven Gould's original book. Take solace in knowing the book is (like usual) much better than the film.CONTENT: 2/5Jumper is a popcorn flick, plain and simple. You won't talk about it after you watch it, and chances are you won't remember it two years from now. Watch it for some mindless entertainment, and expect nothing more. Sometimes, that's more than enough.VIDEO: 5/5One of the best Blu-Ray transfers I've seen. It stands up proud with Narnia and the other fantastic video achievements. Scenes look real, the effects are amazing, and the colors are perfect. If you want to show off Blu-Ray to friends or family, this is the disc to use.AUDIO: 3/55.1 (which is the average these days), but nothing stands out. There's no real loud action, but nothing falters. The effects sound nice, and the music is decent, but, overall, Jumper's audio is completely middle of the road.REPLAY: 1/5If you watch movies with friends to go all MST3K style, this one has much higher replay. Alone, however, you'll watch it once then likely forget about it. Unless, of course, you want to marvel at the technical achievements on your HDTV.EXTRAS: 3.5/5The extras you'd expect from a big budget film. The most memorable is a look into the adaptation process, and that will hopefully lead more people to the book (and other books in the future!).OVERALL: 3.5/5As a movie itself, Jumper is probably only a 1.5 or a 2. With the Blu-Ray presentation, video, and others, however, it's a much better BRD than it is a movie. It's spectacular looking which makes the haphazard plot and shoddy acting bearable, and that's saying a lot for how nice the movie looks. If you have an HDTV, you may want to at least rent this just to see how nice it looks. Whether or not you buy, however, depends on your tolerance of mindless, poorly structured action movies. Basically, 80s action fans will dig it.",4,"Mindless entertainment, perfect Blu to show off your HDTV",1249689600,"08 8, 2009",2009,4715,"['remember', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'Jumper', 'when', 'teaser', 'initial', 'previews', 'came', 'out', 'Then', 'suddenly', 'movie', 'was', 'there', 'front', 'Blu-Ray', 'say', 'was', 'only', 'little', 'disappointed', 'would', 'be', 'understatement.Rather', 'big', 'action', 'ride', 'anticipated', 'Jumper', 'instead', 'showcase', 'digital', 'effects', 'camera', 'work', 'power', 'HD', 'movie', 'people', 'called', 'jumpers', 'who', 'are', 'able', 'teleport', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'played', 'Anakin', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'do', 'found', 'given', 'such', 'great', 'power', 'use', 'own', 'gains.Most', 'people', 'will', 'claim', 'could', 'teleport', ""'d"", 'use', 'good', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'majority', 'would', 'use', 'same', 'way', 'David', 'Rice', 'teleporting', 'rob', 'banks', 'mostly', 'just', 'using', 'travel', 'world', 'instantaneously', 'fulfill', 'own', 'cravings', 'Want', 'Chinese', 'China', 'got', 'Want', 'surf', 'Fiji', 'also', 'have', 'one-night', 'stand', 'London', 'got', 'too.Thankfully', 'movie', ""n't"", 'just', 'David', 'Rice', 'partaking', 'vices', 'jumpers', 'group', 'known', 'Paladins', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'played', 'games', 'D', 'D', 'can', 'guess', 'are', 'religiously', 'based', 'Led', 'film', 'Samuel', 'L', 'Jackson', 'Paladins', 'make', 'duty', 'extinguish', 'jumpers', 'believing', 'only', 'God', 'should', 'have', 'ability', 'be', 'anywhere', 'once.Throw', 'clich', 'eacute', 'girlfriend', 'childhood', 'love', 'interest', 'stranger', 'who', 'bad', 'first', 'obviously', 'up', 'good', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Jumper', 'action', 'film', 'filled', 'great', 'scenes', 'spectacular', 'camerawork', 'SLJ', 'little', 'positive', 'when', 'performances', 'even', 'have', 'phoned', 'one', 'even', 'less', 'positive', 'when', 'plot', 'development', 'sense', 'closure', 'end', 'will', 'obviously', 'be', 'Jumper', '2', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'one.In', 'terms', 'Blu-Ray', 'transfer', 'Jumper', 'one', 'best', 'discs', 'yet', 'terms', 'visual', 'quality', 'Coming', '1080p', '2.35:1', 'framed', 'image', 'film', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'plot', 'showcases', 'Colors', 'are', 'crisp', 'several', 'scenes', 'look', 'outright', 'realistic', 'have', 'HDTV', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'mindless', 'action', 'films', '80s', 'earlier', 'give', 'Jumper', 'try', 'other', 'reason', 'see', 'how', 'awesome', 'films', 'Predator', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'quality', 'picture.Everything', 'else', 'Jumper', 'so-so', 'audio', '5.1', 'never', 'too', 'outstanding', 'too', 'poor', 'extras', 'do', 'job', 'little', 'requirement', 'Featured', 'are', 'obvious', 'ones', 'such', 'making', 'film', 'admit', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'look', 'special', 'effects', 'process', 'look', 'adapting', 'novel', 'film', 'favorite', 'piece', 'matter', 'what', 'take', 'Jumper', 'will', 'likely', 'make', 'interested', 'author', 'Steven', 'Gould', 'original', 'book', 'Take', 'solace', 'knowing', 'book', 'usual', 'much', 'better', 'film.CONTENT', '2/5Jumper', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'plain', 'simple', 'wo', ""n't"", 'talk', 'watch', 'chances', 'are', 'wo', ""n't"", 'remember', 'two', 'years', 'now', 'Watch', 'mindless', 'entertainment', 'expect', 'nothing', 'more', 'Sometimes', 'more', 'enough.VIDEO', '5/5One', 'best', 'Blu-Ray', 'transfers', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'up', 'proud', 'Narnia', 'other', 'fantastic', 'video', 'achievements', 'Scenes', 'look', 'real', 'effects', 'are', 'amazing', 'colors', 'are', 'perfect', 'want', 'show', 'off', 'Blu-Ray', 'friends', 'family', 'disc', 'use.AUDIO', '3/55.1', 'average', 'days', 'nothing', 'out', 'real', 'loud', 'action', 'nothing', 'falters', 'effects', 'sound', 'nice', 'music', 'decent', 'overall', 'Jumper', 'audio', 'completely', 'middle', 'road.REPLAY', '1/5If', 'watch', 'movies', 'friends', 'go', 'MST3K', 'style', 'one', 'much', 'higher', 'replay', 'Alone', 'however', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'once', 'then', 'likely', 'forget', 'Unless', 'course', 'want', 'marvel', 'technical', 'achievements', 'HDTV.EXTRAS', '3.5/5The', 'extras', ""'d"", 'expect', 'big', 'budget', 'film', 'most', 'memorable', 'look', 'adaptation', 'process', 'will', 'hopefully', 'lead', 'more', 'people', 'book', 'other', 'books', 'future', '.OVERALL', '3.5/5As', 'movie', 'Jumper', 'probably', 'only', '1.5', '2', 'Blu-Ray', 'presentation', 'video', 'others', 'however', 'much', 'better', 'BRD', 'movie', 'spectacular', 'looking', 'haphazard', 'plot', 'shoddy', 'acting', 'bearable', 'saying', 'lot', 'how', 'nice', 'movie', 'have', 'HDTV', 'may', 'want', 'least', 'rent', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'nice', 'Whether', 'not', 'buy', 'however', 'tolerance', 'mindless', 'poorly', 'structured', 'action', 'movies', 'Basically', '80s', 'action', 'fans', 'will', 'dig']",Jumper

How would he handle that ability?  Those questions are answered in ""Jumper,"" directed by Doug Liman.""Jumper"" is based on an intriguing premise:  a person has the ability to teleport himself at will to anywhere in the world, whether it be just a few feet away in his apartment or thousands of miles across the globe.  Sounds like a quality belonging to a spandex-clad superhero more than an average Joe.  After all, Superman essentially has that ability because of his super-speed, and Superman dates back to 1938.David Rice (Hayden Christensen) realizes he has this ""jumping"" ability when he almost drowns.  In a split second, he finds himself in the midst of bookshelves in the Ann Arbor Public Library along with enough water to destroy a third of the library's book collection.With a cartoonishly mean father (Michael Rooker) and more than his share of teen angst, David decides to make for the big city, his teleportation talent the road to a whole new life.  But this invisible zipping from space to place doesn't come easily, as David practices teleportation in Central Park, slamming into trees while learning to fine tune his ability.The beginning of ""Jumper"" is very intriguing, and the film promises an enjoyable ride.  But so much goes wrong along the way, the movie crumbles before our eyes.  Let's take the character of David.  Though he's not a traditional superhero, we've become conditioned to expect that a lad lucky enough to have unusual strengths will use them for good.  What does David do?  He breaks into bank vaults, steals huge sums of money, sets himself up in luxury apartments all over the world, picnics atop the Sphinx, surfboards in Fiji, hangs out, literally, from Big Ben in London, and picks up girls all over the world.  He's not exactly bettering mankind or combating evil.The element of conflict that drives the film comes in the character of Roland (Samuel L. Jackson), a Paladin.  The Paladins are Jumper hunters.  Why?  Roland makes a brief comment that only God should have the right to be omnipresent.  Huh?  Is that it?  Yep.  For half the movie, David jumps from place to place to stay ahead of the Paladins, who want to capture him because of pseudo-religious self-righteousness.Christensen is a likable actor and he succeeds in making us care about his David, even though the character is a shallow, pretty-boy hedonist.  I suppose the good will he engendered as young Anakin Skywalker has spilled over to this less interesting character.Jackson mails in this performance.  His appearance with snow-white hair is a lot of fun, though his character is humorless.  We've seen the same from this actor before:  intense close-ups, slow, threatening delivery of dialogue, and attitude a mile wide.  His Paladin is a warrior, which allows for action and violence.  But wouldn't it be interesting if Jackson played the role more low-key, using psychological terror rather than physical force?The film shines when we're introduced to Griffin (Jamie Bell, ""Billy Elliot""), a fellow Jumper David meets in Rome's Coliseum.  Griffin serves as the expositional mouthpiece of the film, informing David (and the audience) that David isn't the only Jumper in the world and providing back story about the Paladins' ongoing persecution of Jumpers.  Bell has enormous energy and a streetwise toughness that contrasts sharply with Cristensen's laid-back style.  Whenever Bell is on screen, he commands it.The dutiful love interest of sorts is provided by the lovely Anna-Sophia Robb as Millie, an adolescent crush from David's hometown, whom he looks up years later and invites to accompany him to Rome.  What happened to ""Want to have a cup of coffee?""  As written, the role of Millie is meant to be serviceable eye candy, and Millie is swept up in the usual machinations of ""things beyond her control,"" becoming more involved in the plot than she should be.A trilogy of writers are responsible for the final screenplay of ""Jumpers,"" which looks as if huge chunks are missing.  Things move too swiftly, even for a movie about a guy who can scoot from city to city in a millisecond.  Viewers are entitled to enough time to get to know the characters so that they care about what happens to them.  A quick dissolve, for instance, shows David going from 15 to 20-something, still living in the same dumpy hotel he came to years before.  Why is he still there when the cash he's stolen can surely allow him to afford better digs?  And why are the teleportation scenes so inconsistent?  Sometimes David whisks to another location with just a rush of air and a swooshing sound.  Other times, there is serious damage to concrete and floor tiles.The locations are interesting, but seem to be there more as scenic backdrops to the story than as integral parts of it.  With the exception of the Rome sequence, those taking place in Cairo, Tokyo, Prague, and Mexico are intended to be impressive to audiences that have seen all these places many times over on screen.  They no longer carry the same impact.Rated PG-13, ""Jumper"" uses an interesting premise, but takes all the wrong turns as it unfolds its tale, offering a movie experience long on special effects, short on meaty story and gripping characters.",2,Great idea squandered,1221955200,"09 21, 2008",2008,5364,"['What', 'average', 'guy', 'Ann', 'Arbor', 'Michigan', 'age', '15', 'ability', 'travel',

Enter David Rice, and his discovery of his ability to immediately appear where ever he chooses. Leaving home at age 15, he sets down roots in New York, and borrows a little money to tide him over for a few years. Where do you go when the world is only a second, a blink, a thought away? What do you do when nothing is beyond your reach?Six years passes, and as a young twentyish, stylish leaper, he learns the ugly truth. He is not alone. And someone is trying to kill him!As long as there have been jumpers, there have been the hunters, the paladins. Armed with weapons that harness electricity to distract a jumpers' active brain power, the paladins track, trap, and kill any jumper within their grasp. David, after escaping from his New York apartment, leaps to his fathers' house and then shows up at a local pub where his almost girl friend works. Millie, surprised to seem David, travels to Rome where they see the sights, and face their own death match in the Colliseum.There are many rules to jumping. No friends are safe. Trust no one. No family is safe. No lovers are safe. Keep one step ahead.He learns the validity of each of the rules as he and Millie run from New York to Paris to Egypt and back. The chase scene is outstanding as action jumps back and forth in a stacatto esque rythymn. Gotta love the top of the Sphynx shots and the bus materializing in the desert outside of Cairo too. The special effects team truly achieved excellence in this production.Cast-wise, Hayden Christiansen, Samuel L Jackson, and Jamie Bell are excellent in their roles. Hayden gives an aloof performance as David Rice, complete with the angst he portrays so well. Mr Jackson IS the hunter, and throughout the film, his intensity is consistant, giving the film the edge Christiansen leaps from for his fly by the seat of his pants character.Technically, this is a film based on a series of novels by Steven Gould. If we look to other sources, Kitty Pryde of the New Mutants (X Men) exhibited a similar ability. The transporters of Star Trek served to advance the stories in a similar time frame. Regardless of the source, and the brilliance of the original work, the film does seem incomplete and the end is disappointing. Live to jump another day...unless a sequel offers a definite end to the eternal battle between Jumper and Bumper, don't bother.Enjoy the film for the light moments, and the spectacular special effects.Then read the books.Www.jumperdvd.comTim Lasiuta",4,Jumper (ing) to Conclusions,1214265600,"06 24, 2008",2008,2611,"['concept', 'Jumper', 'simple', 'Jumpers', 'ability', 'transport', 'place', 'place', 'instant', 'distance', 'notwithstanding', 'Enter', 'David', 'Rice', 'discovery', 'ability', 'immediately', 'appear', 'where', 'ever', 'Leaving', 'home', 'age', '15', 'down', 'roots', 'New', 'York', 'little', 'money', 'tide', 'over', 'few', 'years', 'Where', 'do', 'go', 'when', 'world', 'only', 'second', 'blink', 'thought', 'away', 'What', 'do', 'do', 'when', 'nothing', 'reach', 'Six', 'years', 'young', 'twentyish', 'stylish', 'leaper', 'ugly', 'truth', 'not', 'alone', 'someone', 'trying', 'kill', 'As', 'long', 'have', 'been', 'jumpers', 'have', 'been', 'hunters', 'paladins', 'Armed', 'weapons', 'harness', 'electricity', 'distract', 'jumpers', 'active', 'brain', 'power', 'paladins', 'track', 'trap', 'kill', 'jumper', 'grasp', 'David', 'escaping', 'New', 'York', 'apartment', 'fathers', 'house', 'then', 'up', 'local', 'pub', 'where', 'almost', 'girl', 'friend', 'Millie', 'surprised', 'seem', 'David', 'Rome', 'where', 'see', 'sights', 'face', 'own', 'death', 'match', 'Colliseum.There', 'are', 'many', 'rules', 'jumping', 'friends', 'are', 'safe', 'Trust', 'one', 'family', 'safe', 'lovers', 'are', 'safe', 'Keep', 'one', 'step', 'ahead.He', 'validity', 'rules', 'Millie', 'run', 'New', 'York', 'Paris', 'Egypt', 'back', 'chase', 'scene', 'outstanding', 'action', 'back', 'forth', 'stacatto', 'esque', 'rythymn', 'Got', 'ta', 'love', 'top', 'Sphynx', 'shots', 'bus', 'materializing', 'desert', 'Cairo', 'too', 'special', 'effects', 'team', 'truly', 'achieved', 'excellence', 'production.Cast-wise', 'Hayden', 'Christiansen', 'Samuel', 'L', 'Jackson', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'are', 'excellent', 'roles', 'Hayden', 'aloof', 'performance', 'David', 'Rice', 'complete', 'angst', 'so', 'well', 'Mr', 'Jackson', 'hunter', 'film', 'intensity', 'consistant', 'giving', 'film', 'edge', 'Christiansen', 'fly', 'seat', 'pants', 'character.Technically', 'film', 'based', 'series', 'novels', 'Steven', 'Gould', 'look', 'other', 'sources', 'Kitty', 'Pryde', 'New', 'Mutants', 'X', 'Men', 'exhibited', 'similar', 'ability', 'transporters', 'Star', 'Trek', 'served', 'advance', 'stories', 'similar', 'time', 'frame', 'Regardless', 'source', 'brilliance', 'original', 'work', 'film', 'seem', 'incomplete', 'end', 'disappointing', 'Live', 'jump', 'day', 'sequel', 'definite', 'end', 'eternal', 'battle', 'Jumper', 'Bumper', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother.Enjoy', 'film', 'light', 'moments', 'spectacular', 'special', 'effects.Then', 'read', 'books.Www.jumperdvd.comTim', 'Lasiuta']",Jumper

1156188,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B00177Y9ZC,Todd Smith,"[1, 1]","Jumper is the first film from a trilogy of books by Steven Gould, and while I loved this film, most critics panned it. The story centers around a young Davey (Hayden Christensen), who during a life-threatening event, come to realize he has the power to teleport wherever he wants. Unbeknownst to Davey, he is a member of a group of genetically superior humans known as Jumpers, who are currently at war with a religious organization, that believes their power is evil. What starts out as a simple kid having fun and trying to impress, becomes a fight for survival in this amazing action thriller. You can always tell when a story is adapted from a book, rather than an original screenplay, because the story tends to be more thought out. Not to say screenplays are bad, but when a story isn't made simply to be a movie, it tends to be much more focused on the story, where as screenplays have to worry about the story as well as the aesthetics. Nevertheless, Jumper isn't just another shoot 'em story, it's the perfect mix of action and drama with some outstanding performances. I love Hayden Christensen, who I think is made for roles like this, he has this cool demeanor to him, that's more clever than arrogant. Jamie Bell is also terrific as Griffin, a fellow jumper Davey meets along the way,  and he provides some much needed comic relief. ...and then there's Samuel L. Jackson. What is there to say about Jackson that hasn't already been said? The man is a legend. This film is interesting, unique, fast-paced, and even funny.

From there as he gets older the movie goes downhill.  It seemed like the characters weren't fleshed out enough.  His mother and what she really is a member of and why she left, is revealed (rather weakily) at the end.  And Samuel L. Jackson's character, while interesting, didn't really provide any detail and why he was hunting those with special abilities.  Apparently, there are different gifts given to different people and he was hunting them down to kill them.  Saying ""Only God should have these powers.""  Well, why was he hunting them?  Where did he come from?  Who is he working for?  All these questions left me with very little answers and so the movie just didn't resolve right.  I assume that when directors do these kind of ""stunts"", they'll open for a sequel.  But, if the movie doesn't grab you the first time, who cares about the characters now.

He quickly learns how to harness his power and control it, and then before long he as robbed a bank and is on his way to the ""good life"". Fast-forward  till he is older, he now has a dream apartment in New York and spends his days trotting the globe--breakfast in Paris, surfing in Fiji, lunch on top of the Sphinx, one night stand in London, etc.--you get the picture.He returns home wanting to find his high school crush, Millie (played by Rachel Bilson). He finds her working at the local bar and obviously wants to share his dream-existence with her. There lies a big problem as she quickly suspects something, and before he has time to explain everything to her his ""perfect"" existence is suddenly threatened.It is threatened by a detective Roland (played by Samuel L. Jackson) who is investing the first bank robbery, and slowly starts tracking David. Roland knows about these ""jumpers"", and tracks them down to kill them reminding each one repeatedly ""Only God should have the power...."" As he gets closer to David and his loved ones, the film accelerates into a blinding pace of ""jumping"" action until the end which neatly setup a new franchise.Because of its' poor script, direction, and editing, the special effects and settings are what make this film good. Yes we have seen other superheroes teleport, but I do not remember ever seeing Night-crawler lounging in a beach chair on top of the Sphinx's head or riding thirty-foot waves in Fiji. Watching him do everything you could ever want with this new power is what makes it entertaining, as you anticipate the next destination you will be whisked off to.Hayden Christensen proves he really can act after, and he gives a solid performance, although Jamie Bell (playing another jumper) steals any and all scenes he appears in with his intense, energetic, comic-relief presence. Diane Lane's cameo is a pleasant surprise, and Rachel Bilson's performance as the girlfriend is sincere.My main complaint was the ending, which is so happily clique and a blatant setup for a sequel it leaves you with the feeling ""that's it?""

Jackson are again in sci-fi action, Christensen this time as `jumper' who has the power to teleport and Jackson as `paladin' who hunts the jumpers, believing that only God should have that power. The plot is thin (and there are lots of plot holes) or the back story is almost non-existent, but these things are not the only flaws in ""Jumper"" which could have been a more entertaining film.For whatever happens to our hero Christensen plays, we just don't care. We simply need more interesting character that can carry the whole film to the end. Actually the film's premise is not bad. Some viewers would find him a selfish guy, stealing money from the bank and living lazily, ignoring the news report on the people in trouble, and here the film makes an interesting point - not everyone would behave like Spider-man given a chance to use superpower. His reference to comic books when he asks another jumper (played by Jamie Bell) to help suggests that the filmmakers are aware of that aspect.But except the jumper Jamie Bell plays (and he is much more interesting than Christensen), none of the characters have been developed enough to draw our attention to the film's world. Rachel Bilson is there to constantly ask the hero what is going on, but nothing more is required. Michael Rooker and Diane Lane, both real professionals, look bored. Visual effects are OK and various locations (especially Rome) are joy to see, but they alone would not make up for the bland hero who refuses to interest us.And the hero refuses to learn anything from the past experiences. He doesn't know how to defend himself when paladins show up and he puts his girlfriend in danger more than once. Probably that's why Jamie Bell's jumper, who is smart and knows how to survive, is more interesting.

""Jumper"" tries to carry more signficance than your standard popcorn movie and almost succeeds; David Rice (Hayden Christensen in tortured mode)comes from a broken home. His mother disappeared when he was five and his difficult father (Michael Rooker) makes him wish he could disappear some place else. While walking on ice to retrieve a gift for Millie (Rachel Bilson) girl he likes, David falls through the ice. Trapped he desperately tries to break through and then, suddenly, finds himself in the library near his home. He discovers that by picturing where he wants to be he can jump almost from one instant to the next to that place. This gives him the license to escape and he takes it jumping all around the world, accumulating wealth by robbing banks (and leaving IOU's because, after all, he does PLAN on paying them back). He thinks he's alone in this ability until one day he meets another jumper (Jamie Bell)and discovers that they are being pursued by group called the Paladins led by Roland (Samuel L. Jackson) who is out to KILL all jumpers.Suddenly Rice is on the run and Roland finds Rice's weakness in the form of Millie.Well made by director Doug Liman (""The Bourne Conspiracy""), ""Jumper"" tries a bit too hard to add a dark edge to the film making it more than an entertaining popcorn flick. That's to Liman's credit but the film is best enjoyed as a science fiction action/adventure film. Based on the young adult novels by Steven Gould, ""Jumper"" has little to do with the novels beyond the basic premise. Liman reinvents it for his own purposes. The cast is quite good although I question the casting of Christiansen as Rice. Jamie Bell exudes the dark, troubled quality that Christiansen can only hint at.The Blu-Ray disc looks extremely good with crisp images and rich colors that compliment the location shooting. The visuals are also pretty good as well (although some such as the fight on top of the Sphinx are obvious digital effects). Audio sounds terrific.The Blu-Ray comes with some terrific extras that mirror the regular two disc edition (including the digital copy that evidently comes with that edition on the second disc something I have no use for but some folks might particularly if they watch movies on their mp3 player or ipod). Liman, his writer/producer Doug Kinburg and producer Lucas Foster provide an entertaining and informative commentary track. There's also a animated graphic story providing background on the character of Rice. We also get a number of featurettes that cover everything from adapting the novel (and the multiple changes that occurred) to the look of the film and visual effects.""Jumper"" is a escapist popcorn movie and is enjoyable for that. ALthough Liman tries add depth to the story by giving Rice and other characters dark, tortured backgrounds he isn't able to make this more than that popcorn flick (whereas ""Iron Man"" managed to be both an enjoyable popcorn flick AND a serious flick about troubled Tony Stark). Enjoy it for what you see but don't expect Gould's novel and you'll find this film a diverting & entertaining way to spent 83 minutes.",3,Entertaining popcorn movie--check your preconceptions at the door and don't expect the young adult novel,1213747200,"06 18, 2008",2008,3192,"['Nothing', 'sliding', 'interdimensional', 'wormholes', 'make', 'day', 'Jumper', 'carry', 'more', 'signficance', 'standard', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'almost', 'David', 'Rice', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'tortured', 'mode', 'broken', 'home', 'mother', 'disappeared', 'when', 'was', 'five', 'difficult', 'father', 'Michael', 'Rooker', 'wish', 'could', 'disappear', 'place', 'else', 'walking', 'ice', 'retrieve', 'gift', 'Millie', 'Rachel', 'Bilson', 'girl', 'David', 'ice', 'desperately', 'break', 'then', 'suddenly', 'library', 'home', 'picturing', 'where', 'be', 'can', 'jump', 'almost', 'one', 'instant', 'next', 'place', 'license', 'escape', 'jumping', 'world', 'accumulating', 'wealth', 'robbing', 'banks', 'leaving', 'IOU', 'because', 'PLAN', 'paying', 'back', 'alone', 'ability', 'one', 'day', 'jumper', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'discovers', 'are', 'being', 'pursued', 'group', 'called', 'Paladins', 'led', 'Roland', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'who', 'out', 'KILL', 'jumpers.Suddenly', 'Rice', 'run', 'Roland', 'Rice', 'weakness', 'form', 'Millie.Well', 'made', 'director', 'Doug', 'Liman', 'Bourne', 'Conspiracy', 'Jumper', 'bit', 'too', 'hard', 'add', 'dark', 'edge', 'film', 'making', 'more', 'entertaining', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'Liman', 'credit', 'film', 'best', 'enjoyed', 'science', 'fiction', 'action/adventure', 'film', 'Based', 'young', 'adult', 'novels', 'Steven', 'Gould', 'Jumper', 'little', 'do', 'novels', 'basic', 'premise', 'Liman', 'reinvents', 'own', 'purposes', 'cast', 'quite', 'good', 'question', 'casting', 'Christiansen', 'Rice', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'dark', 'troubled', 'quality', 'Christiansen', 'can', 'only', 'hint', 'at.The', 'Blu-Ray', 'disc', 'extremely', 'good', 'crisp', 'images', 'rich', 'colors', 'compliment', 'location', 'shooting', 'visuals', 'are', 'also', 'pretty', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'such', 'fight', 'top', 'Sphinx', 'are', 'obvious', 'digital', 'effects', 'Audio', 'terrific.The', 'Blu-Ray', 'terrific', 'extras', 'regular', 'two', 'disc', 'edition', 'including', 'digital', 'copy', 'evidently', 'edition', 'second', 'disc', 'something', 'have', 'use', 'folks', 'might', 'particularly', 'watch', 'movies', 'mp3', 'player', 'ipod', 'Liman', 'writer/producer', 'Doug', 'Kinburg', 'producer', 'Lucas', 'Foster', 'provide', 'entertaining', 'informative', 'commentary', 'track', 'also', 'animated', 'graphic', 'story', 'providing', 'background', 'character', 'Rice', 'also', 'get', 'number', 'featurettes', 'cover', 'everything', 'adapting', 'novel', 'multiple', 'changes', 'occurred', 'look', 'film', 'visual', 'effects', 'Jumper', 'escapist', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'ALthough', 'Liman', 'add', 'depth', 'story', 'giving', 'Rice', 'other', 'characters', 'dark', 'tortured', 'backgrounds', ""n't"", 'able', 'make', 'more', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'Iron', 'Man', 'managed', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'serious', 'flick', 'troubled', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Enjoy', 'what', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Gould', 'novel', ""'ll"", 'find', 'film', 'diverting', 'entertaining', 'way', 'spent', '83', 'minutes']",Jumper

First of all the main chacater is a Jumper who is able to go from place to place in the blink of the eye.  He seemed to have had this ability from childhood, but never realized it.  He is 15 before he knows he can move thru space.  My question is how did he get this power.  Turns out there are other Jumpers, no one questions this?  Than there are hunters of the Jumpers....who the heck are these guys and wehre did they come from.It seemed for a brief second that there was a chance to make our Jumper a Super Hero, there is a scene with people drowing in a river the newscaster says they will need a miracle to survive.  The Jumper is watching on tv, does he go save them?  Turns out that the kid is a selfish young man who uses his powers to seduce the ladies and steal things.  Never once does he ask himself why he was given the power.The other issue was the relationship with his childhood sweetheart.  She thinks he is dead than he walks back into her life and he sweeps her off her feet, no questions asked.  She plays a way to gulable character and comes off as unbelivable.Take away all the negatives and the movie flowed well and was an easy movie to watch.

Then, after a teenish bit of bad judgement, he falls through the surface of a frozen river. Once under the ice, the river's current drags him away from the opening, and from light and air. When his lungs are about to burst ... he and a fair bit of river water suddenly materialize in a familiar library.David is a ""Jumper,"" with an incredible ability to teleport himself anywhere, a knack that he soon brings under voluntary control.
