242602,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,6301008618,A Customer,"[10, 10]","The beautiful Julie Christie - there has never been another screen actress, before or after who has had her radiant appeal. She made Petulia - a strange, hyperbolic and surreal sort of film - in 1968 at the height of her stardom. She'd just won the Best Actress Oscar for Darling a few years previously and was now considered one of the icons of the swinging sixties, which made the decision to have her star in this film all the more appropriate.Now finally released DVD, Petulia is just as bizarre, frustrating - and even as irritating - as it was thirty years ago, but the film is worth revisiting, mainly for performances by Christie, Scott and Chamberlain and also for the colourful images of San Francisco during the late 1960s. Directed by Richard Lester, with Nicolas Roeg as cinematographer - who gives the film an artier look than it really deserves - Petulia skewers time like a knife.The film utilizes fast forward and backward cuts, which at the time seemed avant-garde and unconventional, but today it comes across as sort of exasperating. It begins when Petulia, a rich, married, kooky waif, played by Julie Christie, propositions Archie, a tired divorced surgeon, played by George C. Scott, at a San Francisco charity ball. She tells him that she has a husband, but that she desperately wants to have an affair with a married man.Obviously a little odd, Petulia manages to capture Archie's heart and arrives with a tuba and bruises at Scott's apartment quite early one morning. He's a little hesitant to get involved with her as he still has feelings for his wife Polo (Shirley Knight). Archie's friends, Barney and Wilma (Arthur Hill and Kathleen Widdoes), understanding nothing, show him films of himself and his former wife, in hopes of reconciliation.Meanwhile, Petulia's marriage to her husband David (Richard Chamberlain) is on the skids and when he finds out about her affair with Archie he brutally abuses her.  Her father-in-law (Joseph Cotten) visits her bedside while Polo parades her new lover in front of Archie. He in turn tries to have a relationship with his sons and everything plays out in such a fractured, arty and shattered way that it's as though someone had intentionally devastated a perfectly fashioned and crafted film.Although these were turbulent times in America, the film only hints at the social change that was starting to take place. Both Petulia and Archie are quite straight, upper-middle class people; no way do they affiliate themselves with the hippy, counter-culture people, the sexual freedom advocates, and rock music fans, and druggies. But change is also affecting them and although they are as different as night and day, they somehow need each other.Petulia is certainly endemic of the 60's; she's beautiful and playful, oscillating between affection and distance, and exasperatingly glamorous. The film almost plays out in a series of vignettes, without a definitive plot: Archie takes his kids out for a weekend; Petulia unwittingly takes home a Mexican orphan. We constantly see these incidents in brief glimpses, as though Lester is determined to skewer reality, and make us take note of how these two characters are conflicted and vulnerable.Petulia works pretty well as an exercise in how two neurotic people can be trapped by their own fate or by indecision. Don't expect a happy and fulfilled ending as by the film's conclusion, the characters face the same problems - Petulia is still trapped in a marriage to the jealous David and he unsure of his wife's commitment. Archie is still conflicted and cannot settle, and Petulia is unable to know if she can love anybody other than the poor and vulnerable Archie.

Richard Chamberland is a boring pretty boy type married to kooky Christie.The editing is choppy - typical of other Richard Lester films.

242606,AZAR0EO6NGV7,6301008618,"Brent Carleton ""Brent Carleton""","[7, 16]","Julie Christie parades her proletariat pout through 2 hours of psychedelic pretensions, all of which are seemingly supposed to suggest great profundity and hidden meaning--but don't be fooled--this is an empty parcel wrapped in glittering paper, with a core as resoundingly vacuous as the society it attempts to depict.The story, (such as it is) concerns a chic young woman (Miss Christie as ""Petulia"") who picks up children and middle aged men with casual indifference to convention, because she's ""kooky"" (recall that our anti-heroine here inherits this voguish characteristic from her cinematic sisters in ""Georgy Girl,"" ""Darling"" and anything with Sandy Duncan). The reason for this, to which the story eventually arrives, but which it anticipates with frequent visual flashbacks, lies in an unhappy marriage with wealthy pretty boy Richard Chamberlin.In this instance, Petulia's latest adult male conquest is a recently divorced physician, (George C. Scott) with whom she commits adultery, between kooky capers (installing a greenhouse in a residential urban apartment, shopping out the store in an all night grocery etc.) and pronouncements such as ""I think I've just found the cure for cancer"".Amid the kookiness, and in order to assure us that this is all to be taken in deadly earnest, the story includes an incident in which Petulia is hospitalized after sustaining multiple lacerations in Mr. Scott's apartment. This sequence replete with ambulance runs, and much blood is designed to arouse sympathy for any in the audience who haven't yet warmed to our anti-heroine, who also turns out to be expecting a baby.Mr. Scott wears an expression throughout the film suggesting the worst case of indigestion in history, (and by the way it's the only expression he wears) and one wonders if his dissatisfaction is with the script or the character.In any case, he's unsympathetic, not the least of which is because his ex-wife is portrayed by the exquisitely lovely Shirley Knight of the golden blonde hair and guileless cornflower blue eyes. Her performance, so dead on target, saves the film, in at least those sequences in which she appears.Along the way, every visual clich&eacute; in the book is thrown in at some point including protesting hippies, daisy covered vans, strobe lit discotheques, and rock bands. The faddish choppy editing through which these scenes appear fleetingly is about as subtle as a sledge hammer.If the point of this cinematic charade is that modern society is filled with poseurs, then ""Darling"" from three years earlier made the same point much better. In this case, ""Petulia"" is the poseur par excellence.",2,Pretentious claptrap.,1221091200,"09 11, 2008",2008,2641,"['Julie', 'Christie', 'proletariat', 'pout', '2', 'hours', 'psychedelic', 'pretensions', 'are', 'seemingly', 'supposed', 'suggest', 'great', 'profundity', 'hidden', 'meaning', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'empty', 'parcel', 'wrapped', 'glittering', 'paper', 'core', 'resoundingly', 'vacuous', 'society', 'depict.The', 'story', 'such', 'concerns', 'chic', 'young', 'woman', 'Miss', 'Christie', 'Petulia', 'who', 'up', 'children', 'middle', 'aged', 'men', 'casual', 'indifference', 'convention', 'kooky', 'recall', 'anti-heroine', 'here', 'voguish', 'characteristic', 'cinematic', 'sisters', 'Georgy', 'Girl', 'Darling', 'anything', 'Sandy', 'Duncan', 'reason', 'story', 'eventually', 'frequent', 'visual', 'flashbacks', 'unhappy', 'marriage', 'wealthy', 'pretty', 'boy', 'Richard', 'Chamberlin.In', 'instance', 'Petulia', 'latest', 'adult', 'male', 'conquest', 'recently', 'divorced', 'physician', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'whom', 'adultery', 'kooky', 'capers', 'installing', 'greenhouse', 'residential', 'urban', 'apartment', 'shopping', 'out', 'store', 'night', 'grocery', 'etc', 'pronouncements', 'such', 'think', ""'ve"", 'just', 'found', 'cure', 'cancer', 'kookiness', 'order', 'assure', 'be', 'taken', 'deadly', 'earnest', 'story', 'incident', 'Petulia', 'hospitalized', 'sustaining', 'multiple', 'lacerations', 'Mr.', 'Scott', 'apartment', 'sequence', 'replete', 'ambulance', 'runs', 'much', 'blood', 'designed', 'arouse', 'sympathy', 'audience', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'warmed', 'anti-heroine', 'who', 'also', 'out', 'be', 'expecting', 'baby.Mr', 'Scott', 'expression', 'film', 'suggesting', 'worst', 'case', 'indigestion', 'history', 'way', 'only', 'expression', 'one', 'wonders', 'dissatisfaction', 'script', 'character.In', 'case', 'unsympathetic', 'not', 'least', 'ex-wife', 'portrayed', 'exquisitely', 'lovely', 'Shirley', 'Knight', 'golden', 'blonde', 'hair', 'guileless', 'cornflower', 'blue', 'eyes', 'performance', 'so', 'dead', 'target', 'film', 'least', 'sequences', 'appears.Along', 'way', 'visual', 'clich', 'eacute', 'book', 'thrown', 'point', 'including', 'protesting', 'hippies', 'daisy', 'covered', 'vans', 'strobe', 'lit', 'discotheques', 'rock', 'bands', 'faddish', 'choppy', 'editing', 'scenes', 'appear', 'fleetingly', 'as', 'subtle', 'sledge', 'point', 'cinematic', 'charade', 'modern', 'society', 'filled', 'poseurs', 'then', 'Darling', 'three', 'years', 'earlier', 'made', 'same', 'point', 'much', 'better', 'case', 'Petulia', 'poseur', 'par', 'excellence']",Petulia VHS
242607,A3DNQVYEDVGH0F,6301008618,C. Burkhalter,"[37, 44]","Richard Lester's hazy ""Petulia"" is Top Ten list material, in my opinion. More the prototype for Soderberg's ""The Limey"" than even ""Point Blank"" was, this film is a masterpiece of fractured time, subjective narration, and non-linear editing.""Petulia"" tells the story of two very different people whose lives irrevocably intersect in a vague search for place and self in the 1960s. Lester claims to have shaped ""Petulia""'s characters as symbols of 1960s America, and yet rarely has the cinema offered such complex and three-dimensional characters. The title character in particular, played by Julie Christie, is a young ""kook"" recently married into comfortable wealth, and whose behavior is not only unpredicatable, but erratic to the point of schizophrenia. George C. Scott's Archie is a rather serious doctor in the midst of a divorce (he terminated his marriage, he says, because he'd tired of being ""a handsome couple"") and making a rather forced effort to enjoy new bachelorhood. In the opening scene, Petulia tells Archie, ""I've been married six months and I've never had an affair."" After much discussion, but no kissing, Archie and Petulia decide, almost out of resignation, to have an affair. What these characters take from each other is a very complicated thing, which I can only describe as brief protection from what seems inevitable loneliness. Certainly they're an interesting pair. &Uuml;ber-critic Pauline Kael describes Julie Christie's portrayal of Petulia as ""lewd and anxious, expressive and empty, brilliantly faceted but with something central missing, almost as if there's no woman inside."" I couldn't say it better myself. George C. Scott's Archie is a brilliantly understated masculine foil to this Petulia. Richard Combs wrote of him in Film Comment as representative of a type ""reduced to inertia, impotence, terminal ambivalence by the fact that they see too clearly and feel too keenly the compromises that society demands.""Kael is quite hard on this film. I'd characterize most of her criticisms of ""Petulia"" as reactionary, but because she's Pauline Kael, they're worth hearing out. Kael writes of ""Petulia"" as a ""come-dressed-as-the-sick-soul-of-America-party."" Though certainly there's a heavy dose of 60s existential angst, I'd say one of the most striking things about ""Petulia"" is its characters' refusal to fit neatly *as characters,* much less as archetypes, or even to operate at the service of the narrative (as you'd expect of people who are, frankly, figments of that narrative). This works brilliantly with the film's themes of disillusionment and confused identity in a time of both personal and cultural upheaval. ""Petulia"" was filmed in San Francisco at the tail end of the Summer of Love and released in the wake of youth movements that exploded throughout the west in `68. Rather than showcasing the socio-historical import of the era, Lester soaks up all the disillusionment of a major letdown. (Kael calls ""Petulia"" Lester's ""hate letter to America."") In ""Petulia,"" free-spiritedness reveals itself as irresponsibility, passion gives way to rage, and self-preservation is confused for selfishness. Consequences loom large over Archie and Petulia.Antony Gibbs' editing is key here. Flashes backward and forward in time and memory weave throughout ""Petulia."" Brief ellipses of violence, guilt, and regret interrupt and even haunt the narrative like irrepressible thoughts and compulsive memories. Again, Archie and Petulia cannot confrom to the narrative - their very thoughts disrupt it. Gibbs' editing almost dictates the film's style more than Lester's direction does. Its also one of the things Kael most strongly attacked. ""The images of `Petulia' don't make valid connections, they're joined together for shock and excitement,"" she said. The rant goes on, saying Gibbs' editing was ""the most insanely obvious method of cutting film ever devised; keep the audience jumping with cuts, juxtapose startling images, anything for effectiveness."" On paper, this is a valid criticism of fractured, cubist editing. But in the particular case of this film I think the editing's value skyrockets as a means of getting deep inside our two main characters.But moving on, ""Petulia"" is above all a film about people *within a time and place.* ""Petulia"" is cluttered with electric razors, remote-controlled fireplaces, elevators, and other gadgets of better living. Archie in particular is given real depth by his consistent placement in mininal steel-and-glass interiors. (Nicolas Roeg's photography is very much in line with what he did once he began directing.) Archie's apartment is both grand and modern with high ceilings and walls that glow with white sleekness. Occasional pieces of abstract art decorate the space, pieces one can imagine Archie hand-picking with conviction but little interest. Archie's presence sits somewhere between strong, understated strength and classical refinement. Archie's time with Petulia is clearly the most significant of his forays into bachelorhood and into the zeitgeist of the day. Richard Combs correctly notes that Petulia becomes ""the measure by which everything else falls short."" It's difficult to speak on how well the two personalities get along, except perhaps to say that each is certainly changed for its time with the other. There is true and painful awkwardness in every interaction in ""Petulia,"" due largely to the obligations attached to each character's role in each relationship. The reality of each character's unique responsibilities to each other character in the film becomes downright oppressive - fascinating in the context of what was to be remembered as the height of glorious irresponsibility. Petulia, in part a representation of the carefree lifestyle associated with San Francisco in 1968, is no more free of these roles and their responsibilities than Archie is. The great accomplishment of Petulia and Archie's relationship is its attempt to transcend these roles. When the two decide at the film's opening to have an affair, it seems as though they've gravitated to one another partly for the total lack of context for their relationship. As such a pair, they could be, and certainly try to be, heroes of a modern landscape that separately, and ultimately, they are confined by.",5,A masterpiece film on several levels.,1043107200,"01 21,

Richard Lester introduced some innovative techniques with ""A Hard Day's Night"" in 1964 but that gets overlooked because it was in the service of a musical comedy.  ""Petulia"" is a terrific marriage of acting, storytelling, and technique.  The title and cover art suggest a story about a mysterious woman named Petulia (Julie Christie).  The real puzzle that has to be unraveled is that of an emotionally remote doctor named Archie Bollen played by George C. Scott.  Combined with the cross-cutting and a superb performance by Scott we begin to unravel the essence of Archie.  There are terrific performances all around including Christie as the empathetic Petulia, Richard Chamberlain as her abusive husband, and Shirley Knight as Archie's neglected ex-wife.  Lester has provided great atmosphere here by capitalizing on the faces,places, and colors that were late sixties San Francisco.  Lester is aided by top-notch craftsmen in lensman Nic Roeg, a haunting score by John Barry, and also of note is the contribution of associate art director Dean Tavalouris who later worked extensively with Francis Ford Coppola.

242611,A16CZRQL23NOIW,6301008618,Hiram Gomez Pardo,"[2, 2]","Petulia is a brave film. It is not a picture easy to swallow, because it is a demolishing portrait of moral human beings in a decadent world.Every one of these depicted characters has something to pay, because all of them are incapable to realize his or her potential, in search of the total fulfillment of an ethic compromise trying to satisfy the whole expectations of those people whom they love.This awful disorientation process obeys to a sorrowful and probably unconscious self destructive impulse. Lester would seem to underline the terrible ethic abyss between the undeniable advances of all order in an opulent society and a hunger soul, lack of communication, affection and love.Petulia represents the new order. She wants to live several lives in just one; Oliver is his personal hobby, she intends desperately to find the perfect man, and through this self convincing, tries to join the pieces of a messy puzzle, with the best of both men. There is self indulgence, compassion and a serious stage of ambitioned change but without risking. That state of mind only can lead to assume the life as impersonal experience, because you are not able to face your own demons. She possesses the force enough to change of mind but not the necessary courage to give the final leap. That fact is underlined dramatically in the last lines of the film, when she pronounces the name Archie before falling asleep. Somehow you can realize certain similitude with Rosebud, admitting the sleep is a brief evasion, where the happiness in case of being absent, you have to invent it by yourself through the most common of devices; the conformism, that represents a symbol of inaction or renounce.The rest of the characters are subject to life 's fluctuations, and this brief encounter of vanished illusions comes nowhere but it simply transform.But finally the time has come for this film to rescue it and conferring its genuine value as one of the most mature films of the American Cinema in any age, proving this way Ingmar Bergman concerns through his relevant career do not seem to be so distant from this border of the Atlantic. This is undeniably Mark Lester ` major artistic stature film ever made!So consider this film as well The swimmer( see my review about it) as the best exponents of the Author Cinema in 1968.

I remember seeing this movie on the late movie as a teenager and being awed by the acting. the major photography and the editing.I beleive Richard Lester directed this film in a chaotic, revelatory way to express the ""reality"" of what was going down around these characters and in their personal lives as well. Kind of like filming a tragedy of errors in the middle of a psychedelic trip.Richard Chamberlain in the performance of his career. Joseph Cotten is welcome in any film that I view. Shirley Knight gives an incredible performance as one who has no control over their marriage at all anymore, but is clinging to the fantasy that she is in complete control. Kudos to all the supporting cast.And George C. Scott, of course, whether he knows what he's doing or not, he's still giving a brillant performance, a healer who forgets his own importance in this life. His kids, his wife, his friends don't understand his situation, only Petulia.Julie Christie as Petulia: she witnesses George C. Scott's character operate on a Mexican kid with whom she is personally involved. When she meets him at a benefit, she already knows who he is, and she wants to force herself into his life and his situation, even giving him the illusion of having a one-night stand. In doing so, she becomes his troubled muse, and he soon learns some shocking truths about her life.These situations only begin to explain that this movie has several different levels to operate on, and requires multiple viewings to understand. And that is just fine, because the viewer falls in love with the characters and the story that much more after successive viewings.This movie was certainly filmed in the right place at the right time. It is Greek tragedy filled with chaos and uncertainty and populated by souls coming to a spiritual crossroads, thinking that they have made a substantial change in their lives, yet doing nothing but becoming more hedonistic, crazy and materialistic in the process. Kinda sounds like America in the sixty's, doesn't it?This movie is an invaluable document describing the conciousness of people at a cross-roads looking toward an uncertain and materialistic future.Richard Lester, Julie Christie Richard Chamberlain and Nic Roeg all four deserved Academy Awards for this film. However, I give them the first honorary Orson Welles award in tribute for unrecognized filmmaking beyond the call of duty.I'll be loving this movie the rest of my days.Oh yes, the Grateful Dead and Big Brother for a few moments in the film, a miniscule document of their musical presence in the city by the bay in the summer of love.

It goes deeper and more complicated than most people are able to fathom, especially when watching it in a casual manner on TV.  Luckily, I found a old copy of a paperback I probably got at a garage sale years ago in my basement.  The book is wonderful and I highly recommend it.  The book also helps understand the way the movie is put together as they are essentially the same.  A doctor who leaves his wife and children with no particular goal or reason becomes involved with a younger married woman who portrays herself as a carefree kook.  She presents herself as a carefree version of a fling but immediately it becomes clear that casual is the furthest thing from her mind.  She is a woman trying to free herself from a marriage for money which has become a nightmare.  Her husband is wife beater of the most violent kind and his family participates in the constant cover up.  She is a pawn in a game that could get herself killed.  Petulia seems to believe that the doctor could save her from the abusive relationship along with a young boy from Mexico her husband essentially kidnapped and abused also.

The sixties counterculture definitely torpedoed middle-agedwomen. Their husbands, like Archie, the middle-aged doctor played byGeorge G. Scott, have the luxury of deciding they're ""tired"" of beingmarried and jumping into affairs with younger women. This is a cause ofcontinuing sadness to his ex-wife Polo, wonderfully played by ShirleyKnight. Archie becomes involved with Petulia (Julie Christie), aclich&eacute;d ""kooky"" young woman of a type that often appeared in films ofthis period. Petulia is married to an abusive, wealthy husband, David,played with suitable evil by Richard Chamerlain. Christie is such agood actress that she gives some dimension to the role, although she'sfar outshone by Knight as Polo, the wounded wife. In its technique andattitude it really is a European or British film shot in San Franciscowith American actors. There are interesting cultural references to thesixties, that may have seemed daring at the time, but now seem moreinnocent than anything else. The film is really about Archie and men ofhis generation and their bewilderment at the changing cultural moresrepresented by Petulia.

242619,A3NI800P6Q6YNS,6301008618,Matthew J. Gallagher,"[13, 20]","George C. Scott was quoted in a long ago publication called ""Memories,"" as saying he ""didn't understand a line of 'Petulia,' but the director seemed to know what he was doing.""  ""Petulia"" is worth seeing, but more as an artifact than as a lasting work of art.  It's simply too stilted, with too much artifice, especially with the often unnecessary cuts to images that, as critic Pauline Kael rightly points out, really add next to nothing to the drama we are witnessing. Despite Julie Cristie's incredibly beautiful presence, welcome in any film, the best scene in the film is between George C. Scott and Shirley Knight, as a just divorced couple.  The scene builds to a believable, heartbreaking conclusion on Scott's bed with him kissing her in a way we see she's always wanted to be kissed by him - we see two people who left too much of themselves out of their marriage and now, at the end, realize it. Knight is first rate in this film - beautifully nuanced, but with a hard core to her that she can't quite break free of.  This is true for all of the characters, in one way or another, and there are many marvelous touches of dialogue that go a long way to making this a worthwhile film. But the central coupling of Scott and Christie is simply not fully explored enough - we don't really SEE either the physical or the mental or spiritual attraction - and we have to.  The dialogue between them doesn't really build. And the chemistry between Scott and Christie is odd and off putting (check out the lack of kissing - when Christie does kiss him, they're just pecks). There is an outstanding film waiting to get out here, but this is not it.  It's diverting, interesting, but ultimately unsatisifying - and, in its choice of somewhat cheap jump cuts, and the absolutely awful acting by those in bit parts - not worthy of being considered a great film.",3,"Interesting, humane, but not as great as advertised",1153612800,"07 23, 2006",2006,1858,"['George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'was', 'quoted', 'long', 'ago', 'publication', 'called', 'Memories', 'saying', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'line', ""'Petulia"", 'director', 'seemed', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'Petulia', 'worth', 'seeing', 'more', 'artifact', 'lasting', 'work', 'art', 'simply', 'too', 'stilted', 'too', 'much', 'artifice', 'especially', 'often', 'unnecessary', 'cuts', 'images', 'that', 'critic', 'Pauline', 'Kael', 'rightly', 'out', 'really', 'add', 'next', 'nothing', 'drama', 'are', 'witnessing', 'Julie', 'Cristie', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'presence', 'welcome', 'film', 'best', 'scene', 'film', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'Shirley', 'Knight', 'just', 'divorced', 'couple', 'scene', 'believable', 'heartbreaking', 'conclusion', 'Scott', 'bed', 'kissing', 'way', 'see', 'always', 'wanted', 'be', 'kissed', 'see', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'left', 'too', 'much', 'marriage', 'now', 'end', 'realize', 'Knight', 'first', 'rate', 'film', 'beautifully', 'nuanced', 'hard', 'core', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'break', 'free', 'true', 'characters', 'one', 'way', 'are', 'many', 'marvelous', 'touches', 'dialogue', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'making', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'central', 'coupling', 'Scott', 'Christie', 'simply', 'not', 'fully', 'explored', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'SEE', 'physical', 'mental', 'spiritual', 'attraction', 'have', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'really', 'build', 'chemistry', 'Scott', 'Christie', 'odd', 'off', 'putting', 'check', 'out', 'lack', 'kissing', 'when', 'Christie', 'kiss', ""'re"", 'just', 'pecks', 'outstanding', 'film', 'waiting', 'get', 'out', 'here', 'not', 'diverting', 'interesting', 'ultimately', 'unsatisifying', 'choice', 'somewhat', 'cheap', 'jump', 'cuts', 'absolutely', 'awful', 'acting', 'bit', 'parts', 'not', 'being', 'considered', 'great', 'film']",Petulia VHS

Amy,"[2, 2]","This film is unbelieveably great both stylistically and in its story of how ""The Pepsi Generation"" of the late-1960s put reckless impetuousness at a premium- which can lead to throwing away one's marriage one instant, and then changing your mind about it the next.This is Richard Lester's greatest flick. ""Hard Day's Night"" was great, of course, but here you get a jump-cut style that includes both flashbacks and premonitions- it seems a very hip style and is suited to the subject matter of the film. And the shots are brilliantly composed- very dramatic visuals (really, it is like an innovative language of film visuals, in that a single conversation or interaction between two characters can be illustrated with changing visual motifs. The slideshow of Archie's ex-marriage during conversation about his current life is especially brilliant).Also, you get about a minute and a half of the Dead playing ""Viola Lee Blues"", in their psychedelic heyday- complete multi-media experience. And, in one scene Garcia and Weir appear amongst what are supposed to be the ""neighbors"", who are rubbernecking a denizen of their turf being carted off on a gurney. The neighborhood is Telegraph Hill, San Fran.- thought to myself: ""why aren't these guys in the Haight-Ashbury?""- because they wanted to be in the movie!Also, it has George C. Scott giving his usual great performance. And Julie Christie is believeably kooky.Buy this one, man- one of the greatest all-time of celluloid creations.
