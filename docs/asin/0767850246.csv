It jumps and jitters from one track to another quite unexpectedly. The fact that there are some good jokes told by good actors only adds to the overall confusion.If given the time to shape inside the director's and scriptwriters' heads that movie could be one of the funniest offerings of the year. Instead in just stumbles to the ridiculous and utterly unfunny finale.Annette Bening is the ex-alcoholic of Mars Attacks! and the realtor of American Beauty. Linda Fiorentino is her usual maneating self. No surprises here. And Garry Shandling's face looks paralyzed.Just as the movie's baby, the film was born much earlier than it was due.",2,A waste.,978998400,"01 9, 2001",2001,735,"['think', 'film', 'flounders', 'just', 'was', 'made', 'haste', 'definitely', 'half-baked', 'jitters', 'one', 'track', 'quite', 'unexpectedly', 'fact', 'are', 'good', 'jokes', 'told', 'good', 'actors', 'only', 'overall', 'confusion.If', 'given', 'time', 'shape', 'director', 'scriptwriters', 'heads', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'one', 'funniest', 'offerings', 'year', 'Instead', 'just', 'stumbles', 'ridiculous', 'utterly', 'unfunny', 'finale.Annette', 'Bening', 'ex-alcoholic', 'Mars', 'Attacks', 'realtor', 'American', 'Beauty', 'Linda', 'Fiorentino', 'usual', 'maneating', 'self', 'surprises', 'here', 'Garry', 'Shandling', 'face', 'paralyzed.Just', 'movie', 'baby', 'film', 'was', 'born', 'much', 'earlier', 'was', 'due']",N/A

But see, that's the problem, we're asked to accept a  little to much. I tried just sitting back and trying to go along with  everything. And I must admit I did laugh at some moments. And thought that  all of the characters were fun to watch, which include Annette Bening, John  Goodman, Greg Kinnear, Linda Fiorentino, and Ben Kingsley, but I honestly  feel Shandling was wrong for the movie. With a movie like this, considering  the plot, you really need more slapstick humor I think. And Shandling is  not known for his great rang as a phyiscal comedian. His comedy is more  verbal, and if your going to play a space alien, you really need more  phyiscal comedy. A lot of the jokes should come from the way he tried to  &quot;fit in&quot;. This is where the phyiscal comedy was needed. We should  of been laughing at the way he went about picking up women. Instead we hear  him using wisecracks and actually picking up women! Which all seemed out of  character. It's kind of easy for me to see why this Mike Nichols' comedy  flopped. Don't expect to much from this movie. Yes, it has some laughs, and  I know, it's not meant to be taken serious, who in their right mind could  take this seriuosly. But, it just doesn't build up to what could of been.

22738,AR3BZOTB7IY78,0767850246,Anton Karidian,"[2, 5]","For about the first 20 minutes or so, I thought WHAT PLANET ARE YOU FROM? was going to be very funny. The set-up was a bit puzzling as male aliens intend to conquer Earth by procreating with Earth women, which was not quite explained, yet I thought that would eventually become clearer. At the outset there were some funny gags as the aliens discussed how to relate to Earth women, and Gary Shandling at first was humorous as the aliens ineptly tried to score with women. Then suddenly, about the time he met Annette Bening, who was to become his wife, the movie began wandering aimlessly, with strange lines, no discernable purpose, and very few laughs. There are LOTS of scenes here that don't work at ALL. Also, given the suggestive story-line, there is surprisingly little sexiness to this film, so don't get it for that reason either. There's a fair amount of racy talk, and for the visuals, a couple of brief topless scenes (no, Annette Bening doesn't do one of them). I hate to see a good cast like this utterly wasted, but did any of them read the horrible script before agreeing to do the film? Or did the script change for the worse after they began filming?

I was expecting a funny and smart comedy --am I asking too much?--, but what I got instead was a very boring and meaningless flick. And what's more, a waste of talents!The plot follows an alien who lands on earth in order to get a woman preganant and improve his specie. It could have deliverd many laughs, but it made me feel very embarassed most of the time. The only person who seems to try to give a nice perfornance -- and she does so, despite the limitations of the senseless script -- is Annette Bening. She is beautiful and radiante in this movie, but it is not enough to save the silly screenplay and the misguided direction. The leading man, Garry Shandlin, is nothing but awful. He does not cast as the alien. Maybe he played this role because he is one of the producers and one of the four (!) writers who wrote ths screenplay. He's got the most embassing moments in this so called comedy, due to the fact his character has a 'mechanic' penis which makes a strange noise everytime he gets 'hot'. This is supposed to be funny!  The other actors play the same kind of character that they are very used to. Linda Fiorentino is sexy, Greg Kinnear is seducer, John Goodman is the intelligent one, Ben Kingsley is the strange .The script is a mess itself. It is the kind of thing that usually happens when a movie is rewritten many times by different script writers before shooting. So having four people working on it didn't help at all. And instead of that kind of fish-out-of-the-water jokes we have an alien who is very used to living on earth despite the fact that he had never been here before. For instance, when he arrives, he's already got a job and even some recommendation letters. Plus, everytime he needs to talk to his master from the other planet, he seems to go to an airplane toilet. But we never see going to, so we feel like 'where the hell is he?' In my opinion, the worst unexplained fact is that Annette's character gets preganant and her preganancy lasts only 3 months (!!!!) and the only thing the doctor says after she gives birth is &quot;Don't tell it to other couple, because they will want it too&quot;. Can you believe? Where wouldn't any doctor get worried about something like this? It is unconceivable!All in all, before watching it I knew it was terrible, but not this terrible!

E Jackson,"[1, 1]","I really liked the way the jokes came across in What Planet Are You From?Lots of weiner jokes that were used creatively and even somewhat intelligently, NOT horribly and obvious.  The way the ""alien"" would come up to women and demand having sex with them because it was his job to have a baby with a woman and bring the baby back to his home alien world was VERY funny to me.  Of course it wasn't believable in ANY way, and it wasn't supposed to be.I'm very surprised the writers actually included segments involving the alien world, since to me, that seems one step TOO far into whacky and tacky, if you get my drift.I thought the story was great how the ""alien"" finally found just the right woman for him to have a baby with, and honestly, the very best thing about the movie is the way the alien cleverly tried convincing women he wanted to have a baby with them.  You see, the women thought the alien was a nice, responsible adult man looking to start a family- they had no IDEA he was actually an alien appearing on earth for one reason and one reason only, and *this* is why the story was great!The only thing I didn't like was how the alien (in case you don't know, the alien is actually just an adult man) came back to earth- apparently the only way he can get back to earth is to appear in an airplane that's flying in the air.

Gary Shandling plays an Alien sent to earth to impregnate a  woman and secure a child. Why? Well I can't say that I fully understood  why, but after a while it didn't matter. Shandling comes to earth looking  for promiscuous sex, and finds that it may be harder than he thought. Add  to that the fact that his artificial member hums when he gets aroused, and  you will find yourself laughing out loud more than once. Some of  Shandling's best lines are delivered with such a dry wit that you can't  help but laugh at them. The cast includes good performances by Annette  Benning, John Goodman, Greg Kinnear, Linda Fiorentino, and Ben Kingsley. At  times this movie seems to lose it's way and becomes more of a romance, but  it quickly finds it's way back to the comedy it was intended to be. The  ending is especially funny.

Shandling does get off some witty one-liners and while they were appreciated, they don't even fit in the context of the movie since he is playing an emotionless blank slate who is supposed to be clueless about the ways of women and the world.The premise is not terribly original but it could still have been used to sharply mock gender conventions and even take the viewer on a wild ""Being John Malkovich""-style ride where you never know what to expect next. No such luck -- there are some stretches of the movie where nothing at all happens, and even when there is ""action"", it's nothing surprising or interesting. Aside from the mild-at-best satire, we get the message from the movie that it is better to devote yourself to your wife and newborn child than abandon them because of your duty to your job (and home planet). Stop the presses, boys.I wanted to like this movie, I really did, but I think 2 stars is extremely generous considering that ""What Planet Are You From?"" is supposed to be funny but is not, many parts don't make sense (even for an absurdist comedy), and it wastes tons of talent from the supporting players. John Goodman, Linda Fiorentino, Ben Kingsley and Greg Kinnear are all given small and uninteresting roles.  Apparently the only reason they were casted is because it's funny to hear a famous person say words for genitals that Amazon won't let me print here.  Annette Bening does do a good job in the thankless role of an emotionally vulnerable real estate agent (she better watch out or she'll get permanently typecast after this and ""American Beauty"") who becomes the alien's target.Shandling does get a few good digs in, and the movie is lighthearted and silly enough that I can't hate it too much for frittering away a couple hours of my time. I can't really recommend ""What Planet Are You From?"" though, unless you have absolutely no access to ""The Larry Sanders Show"" or ""The Brother From Another Planet"" and you're dying to see Garry Shandling along with a fish-out-of-water movie involving an alien.",2,Featherweight comedy is disappointing from Shandling,1015286400,"03 5, 2002",2002,2658,"['Garry', 'Shandling', 'one', 'few', 'comedians', 'like', ""'ve"", 'always', 'enjoyed', 'Larry', 'Sanders', 'Show', 'when', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'alone', 'was', 'enough', 'get', 'see', 'What', 'Planet', 'Are', 'co-wrote', 'stars', 'movie', 'Shandling', 'alien', 'who', 'sent', 'Phoenix', 'impregnate', 'woman', 'first', 'step', 'towards', 'infiltrating', 'conquering', 'Earth', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'well', 'movie', 'would', 'poke', 'wicked', 'fun', 'dating', 'rituals', 'expectations', 'Instead', 'half', 'humor', 'can', 'call', 'fact', 'alien', 'penis', 'mechanical', 'buzzing', 'noise', 'whenever', 'aroused', 'Shandling', 'get', 'off', 'witty', 'one-liners', 'were', 'appreciated', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'fit', 'context', 'movie', 'playing', 'emotionless', 'blank', 'slate', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'clueless', 'ways', 'women', 'world.The', 'premise', 'not', 'terribly', 'original', 'could', 'still', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'sharply', 'mock', 'gender', 'conventions', 'even', 'take', 'viewer', 'wild', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', '-style', 'ride', 'where', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'next', 'such', 'luck', 'are', 'stretches', 'movie', 'where', 'nothing', 'happens', 'even', 'when', 'action', 'nothing', 'surprising', 'interesting', 'Aside', 'mild-at-best', 'satire', 'get', 'message', 'movie', 'better', 'devote', 'wife', 'newborn', 'child', 'abandon', 'duty', 'job', 'home', 'planet', 'Stop', 'presses', 'boys.I', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'really', 'did', 'think', '2', 'stars', 'extremely', 'generous', 'considering', 'What', 'Planet', 'Are', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'not', 'many', 'parts', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'even', 'absurdist', 'comedy', 'tons', 'talent', 'supporting', 'players', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Linda', 'Fiorentino', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'are', 'given', 'small', 'uninteresting', 'roles', 'Apparently', 'only', 'reason', 'were', 'casted', 'funny', 'hear', 'famous', 'person', 'say', 'words', 'genitals', 'Amazon', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'print', 'here', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'thankless', 'role', 'emotionally', 'vulnerable', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'better', 'watch', 'out', ""'ll"", 'get', 'permanently', 'typecast', 'American', 'Beauty', 'who', 'alien', 'target.Shandling', 'get', 'few', 'good', 'digs', 'movie', 'lighthearted', 'silly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hate', 'too', 'much', 'frittering', 'away', 'couple', 'hours', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'recommend', 'What', 'Planet', 'Are', 'have', 'absolutely', 'access', 'Larry', 'Sanders', 'Show', 'Brother', 'From', 'Planet', ""'re"", 'dying', 'see', 'Garry', 'Shandling', 'along', 'fish-out-of-water', 'movie', 'involving', 'alien']",N/A
22749,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,0767850246,"""flickjunkie""","[8, 10]","This is a cute little sex farce starring and written by Garry Shandling.  Harold Anderson (Shandling) is actually an alien on a very special mission.  He must impregnate an earth woman to begin the infiltration of earth for  eventual domination and takeover.  He has done his research and learned to  be a good listener, dutifully repeating ""uh huh"" at every utterance by a  female.  Unfortunately, there are certain subtleties he hasn't mastered in  the fine art of seduction, and he gets his face slapped repeatedly.After  countless humorous failures he meets his future mate Susan (Annette  Benning), and discovers that the only way she will have sex with him is if  he marries her.  After the nuptials he learns that all the rules of  engagement have changed.This droll script ranges from mildly silly to  hysterical as it holds a circus mirror up to our mating rituals.  Shandling  is always funny with his deadpan whiney style, but the real treat here is  Annette Benning.  She makes this film work as Shandling's overwrought love  interest.  As she did in ""American Beauty"", she plays another caricature  role to perfection.  Here she is the aging female who has been a continual  loser at the dating game and is desperately searching for love.  Her  brilliant performance is a treat that upstages Shandling at every turn.  In  addition, the rest of the cast is wonderful and fits well with Shandling's  wry sense of humor.This is a fun and very light comedy that works well  most of the time.  I rated it 7/10.

Wolfson,"[41, 46]","Mike Nichols; Gary Shandling; Annette Bening; Ben Kingsley; John Goodman; Greg Kinnear...Some may look at this list of utterly-undeniably talented people and expect great achievement, while others may anticipate a too-many-cooks effect. Whatever *you* expect from What Planet Are You From? I can tell you one thing; Let this be the only review you read!!I have read countless reviews of this film, such as Roger Ebert's One-Star one-note write up (in which he sounds as if he wishes he wrote the film), The SF Examiner's feeble complaint and Time Magazine's bile explosion in paragraph form, and they all nitpicked the film to death while ignoring the beauty of it all. Some focused on the 'buzzing penis' gag which leads me to believe they only screened previews and slept through the actual film. Yet others complained that Gary Shandling isn't sexy and shouldn't have starred in the title role. Uhhh... OK, lets cast Fabio, for his looks and great comedic timing.I've seen plenty of movies, many of them comedies, and this one ranks with some of the best. I feel the casting was inspired across the board and features one of Greg Kinnear's best performances as a slimy womanizing cretin. Shandling is stellar as always, seeming to have an endless supply of one-liners and expressions for any situation. Annette Bening is possibly the best actress of her generation, and this performance clinches it.I'll bring it into focus for you: it's a comedy of manners featuring a procreation-obsessed alien and a sex/relationship-disfunctional planet. The script is a Shandlingesque miracle and the performances are perfect. The film mixes universal truths about the human condition and truly funny situations which could have been clich&eacute;s but were saved by the sly screenplay.I don't know what the negative reviewers were expecting, but I got exactly what I thought I would: gifted actors and a fantastic director making what should have been a huge hit.

Carter,"[10, 11]","You would think given the subject matter that this would movie might come across like some 'Porky's'/'Airplane' movie but instead it's almost like a family comedy with a nicely understated performance by 'Garry Shandling' who I'd never seen in any other movies.  A great cast helps with what could have been a awkward looking movie, but with 'John Goodman', 'Ben Kingsley' & 'Annette Benning' all giving perfect-pitch back-up roles you can relax in the knowledge of grade A cast.  There are a few slow parts to the movie however.  I did find the parts with Greg Kinnear a little long-winded (hence the 4 not 5 score) but overall it zips along at a good pace & it also has a lot of heart, getting almost too saccharine at the end but as in all comedies you know that what goes around comes around and that our hero will eventually get the girl.  'Ben Kingsley' is very funny as the bad guy & 'John Goodman' is on top form as the obsessed inspector.  'Annette Benning' is reliably angelic as the put-upon girlfriend who is strangely understanding of Gary's character's vibrating unmentionable's.  I have never watched the 'Gary Shandling' show but was happily surprised by his performance here.  The fact that he's obviously not a professional actor actually helps in his performance here & adds a certain authenticity and charm to his alien character.  He just doesn't know how to act in this human world & his character actually comes over as quite appealing.

22758,A3CCQKKTL7M189,0767850246,MIKE PHILLIPS,"[0, 2]","I'm never to keen on pictures that are written a vehicles for stars, by the stars themselves. However, when its Gary Shandling and Mike Nichols, you know it can't be all that bad. This movie, about an alien sent to Earth  to procreate in order to repopulate his sterile world, has its share of  cliches, but also has its share of genuinely funny moments. People that are  old enough to remember further back than the Larry Sanders show on HBO,  might liken this movie more to the Fox Networks tv program The Gary  Shandling Show, that debuted about the same time as Married With Children.  His character is more like the likeable, bumbling Shandling and less like  the wise mouth, venemous Larry Sanders.Annette Benning is one of those rare  actresses who can switch from comedy to drama like a light being turned on  and off.Witness her funny delivery of the alien child, and then her  dramatic performance when Shandlings alien leader kidnaps her child and  takes it back to the mother planet. While Benning's character is wildly  fun, Shandling's alien is very low keyed, much like the actor himself. Most  of the gags comparing alien behavior to male earthling behavior are right  on the money, courtesy of Nichols direction. However, I agree that there's  not much to this film besides one liners, Bennings performance, and that of  the always loveable con man Greg Kinnear.While Shandling is no action hero,  he does manage to save the day and wrap up the movie very predictably.One  thing the film does re-enforce, however, is man's ability to affect/corrupt  the aliens that do settle among us. Luckily, in this case, Shandlings alien  finds the modicum of good in the human race instead of the bad.

On a planet a thousand years more technologically advanced than Earth, the entire population is male clones with no sex organs, no emotions, andnothing better to do than conquer the Universe.  Their technique--though it's never explained--involves impregnating a woman on the planet they wish to take over.  So their leader, Graydon--played byBen Kingsley in a nice turn--instructs them in the fine art of seducing an Earth woman, which to their minds mainly consists of complimenting her hair and shoes. Their quickest learner, H1449-6 (GaryShandling), is chosen to perform the deed and is whisked to Earth where he is deposited in the lavatory of a passenger jet.  The disruption this causes the flight brings him to the attention of an NTSB inspector(John Goodman).  But he is able to rapidly establish himself in a job as Harold Anderson, bank loan officer, and, thanks to the womanizing connivance of a co-worker (Greg Kinnear), he's soon romancing arecovering alcoholic, Susan Hart (Annette Benning), who they meet at an AA meeting where they've gone to scam babes.  And so we have the basic dramatic tension of the film: Will Harold be discoveredbefore he can complete his mission?The film gets to this point mostly on the strength of battle-of-the-sexes humor and some physical comedy involving the mechanical penis that Shandling's character has had attached to enable him tocomplete his mission.  It continues in this vein through the early portion of Harold's relationship with Susan, but when he ends up having to marry her to get her to bear his child the inevitable humanizing takesplace and a more serious message starts to peak out from beneath the more sophomoric sex comedy and the unfortunately disjointed story line.  This initial message concerns the utter emptiness of themodern mating game, which is all about sex and only peripherally, if at all, about meaningful interaction between two people.  By the end--when Harold realizes that Graydon won't let Susan keep their babyand that the experience of love, loyalty, sex, death, and all the rest that makes us human is superior to the supposedly advanced bioengineered culture of his home world--it's become very much a politicalfilm, whether intentionally or no.  It comes down so firmly on the side of humanity as it is, with all our glorious and maddening imperfections, and against the vision of a future that is perfect but soulless, thatregardless of an over reliance on genitalia jokes it ends up being a profoundly conservative movie, and a pretty funny one at that.GRADE: B+",4,underrated,1037923200,"11 22, 2002",2002,2612,"['set', 'up', 'film', 'simple', 'silly', 'enough', 'planet', 'thousand', 'years', 'more', 'technologically', 'advanced', 'Earth', 'entire', 'population', 'male', 'clones', 'sex', 'organs', 'emotions', 'andnothing', 'better', 'do', 'conquer', 'Universe', 'technique', 'never', 'explained', 'impregnating', 'woman', 'planet', 'wish', 'take', 'over', 'So', 'leader', 'Graydon', 'played', 'byBen', 'Kingsley', 'nice', 'turn', 'fine', 'art', 'seducing', 'Earth', 'woman', 'minds', 'mainly', 'complimenting', 'hair', 'shoes', 'quickest', 'learner', 'H1449-6', 'GaryShandling', 'chosen', 'perform', 'deed', 'whisked', 'Earth', 'where', 'deposited', 'lavatory', 'passenger', 'jet', 'disruption', 'flight', 'attention', 'NTSB', 'inspector', 'John', 'Goodman', 'able', 'rapidly', 'establish', 'job', 'Harold', 'Anderson', 'bank', 'loan', 'officer', 'thanks', 'womanizing', 'connivance', 'co-worker', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'soon', 'romancing', 'arecovering', 'alcoholic', 'Susan', 'Hart', 'Annette', 'Benning', 'who', 'meet', 'AA', 'meeting', 'where', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'scam', 'babes', 'so', 'have', 'basic', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'film', 'Will', 'Harold', 'be', 'can', 'complete', 'mission', 'film', 'point', 'mostly', 'strength', 'battle-of-the-sexes', 'humor', 'physical', 'comedy', 'involving', 'mechanical', 'penis', 'Shandling', 'character', 'had', 'attached', 'enable', 'tocomplete', 'mission', 'vein', 'early', 'portion', 'Harold', 'relationship', 'Susan', 'when', 'up', 'having', 'marry', 'get', 'bear', 'child', 'inevitable', 'humanizing', 'takesplace', 'more', 'serious', 'message', 'peak', 'out', 'more', 'sophomoric', 'sex', 'comedy', 'unfortunately', 'disjointed', 'story', 'line', 'initial', 'message', 'utter', 'emptiness', 'themodern', 'mating', 'game', 'sex', 'only', 'peripherally', 'about', 'meaningful', 'interaction', 'two', 'people', 'end', 'when', 'Harold', 'Graydon', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'Susan', 'keep', 'babyand', 'experience', 'love', 'loyalty', 'sex', 'death', 'rest', 'human', 'superior', 'supposedly', 'advanced', 'bioengineered', 'culture', 'home', 'world', 'become', 'very', 'much', 'politicalfilm', 'intentionally', 'down', 'so', 'firmly', 'side', 'humanity', 'glorious', 'maddening', 'imperfections', 'vision', 'future', 'perfect', 'soulless', 'thatregardless', 'over', 'reliance', 'genitalia', 'jokes', 'up', 'being', 'profoundly', 'conservative', 'movie', 'pretty', 'funny', 'one', 'that.GRADE', 'B+']",N/A
22762,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,0767850246,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 11]","The title of this film - `What Planet Are You From?' - might better be addressed to the people who made this miserable excuse for a romantic comedy. What could have been a slashing satire on the roles men and women adopt in relationships - the bestseller `Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus' is never very far from the filmmakers' sensibilities - degenerates in no time at all into little more than a series of tired sex jokes on the level of a junior high school locker room conversation.The waste of acting talent in this film is truly mind-boggling. I am sure that Garry Shandling, Annette Benning, Greg Kinnear, Ben Kingsley, Linda Fiorentino and John Goodman will not be featuring this particular work very prominently on their acting resumes. In fact, the film may well mark the career nadirs for each and every one of these truly talented performers.And what has happened to director Mike Nichols? The Oscar-winning auteur of one of the most prescient and groundbreaking of sexual satires - `The Graduate' - seems totally lost in this venture. (But then again, `The Graduate' was made a whopping 33 years earlier). Evidence of the casual sloppiness of so much of the writing is apparent in the fact that Harold (Shandling) - the alien from an all-male planet sent on a mission to impregnate an earth woman to help in his civilization's quest for universal domination - is so immediately adaptable to the ways and methods of life on earth that he doesn't seem like an alien at all. Most of the attempts at humor early on in the film center around Harold's unsubtle attempts to mate with every woman he meets. But once he has mastered that, he seems totally at home as a man on earth. The film can't even stay true to its own premise.John Goodman, Greg Kinnear and Ben Kingsley are reduced to little more than embarrassed, gaping onlookers to the main narrative strand, as Harold romances Susan (Benning), a stereotypical AA member who has been converted into a mass of twitching insecurities and neuroses thanks to the cavalier treatment she has received from men all her life. This storyline, unfortunately, prevents the film from ever achieving real satirical bite because it leads to an inevitable romantic softness as Harold, predictably, comes - through his relationship with Susan - to value the human traits of love and commitment.So where ARE all the courageous movie satirists these days, the ones truly daring enough to push the envelope of iconoclasm and good taste?
