Dick Shawn, one of the most under appreciated comedians in the movies is very funny as Captain Cash.  He is sent to capture an Italian town.  The Italian commander is willing to surrender if they can have a festival first. They have a festival and things start to go sideways. There is a fake battle, Nazi's show up, and there are people running through catacombs and communists who what the Nazi commander.  Harry Morgan, who was colonel Potter on MASH is Major Pott and he slowly goes crazy as he gets lost in the Catacombs beneath the City.  James Coburn is very good and along with Aldo Ray keep the story going.  I enjoyed this movie when it first came out and waited a long time for the DVD.

Although some critics dismissed this film as an insult to three countries I thourly enjoyed it. No it isn't P.C. but who cares. It simply takes a funny situation to the level of absurdity.

329209,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6302719054,David Baldwin,"[1, 1]","This one-joke movie about the Italian Army's intestinal fortitude in engaging the war is tough going particularly when you consider the film's nearly two hour running time.  It's certainly watchable but doesn't deliver the chuckles one would expect.  It's nothing more than an extended episode of ""McHale's Navy"" with less laughs.  I'd say ""Hogan's Heroes"" but that show was repugnant.  Lone saving graces are a charming, not to say voluptuous, Giovanna Ralli and an all too brief turn by Carroll O'Connor as a gruff general.

He is simply not trying too much here. This movie feels like its as long as the campaign in Italy. The comedy feels forced. I just cannot fully recomend this if you looking for a James Coburn movie. Dick Shawn is not up to his usual caliber either and the part with Henry Morgan (of Col. Potter fame from MASH TV) is wasted as is Carol O'Conner.
