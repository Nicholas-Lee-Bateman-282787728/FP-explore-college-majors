Did California public schools have funding for that kind of project back in 1978? Probably not, but this movie is a superb showcase of Mark Hamill's physical acting ability and agility, natural comedic talent, and is a great historical recording of the Vegas of yesteryear. Also has a great plot twist and some bad guys who are really, really BAD guys. And I'd like to think that even back in the 70s it was not a common thing for high school graduates to pursue prostitution as a career choice (even if college wasn't an option), so suspend your disbelief and enjoy Annie Potts' comedic portrayal of a sometimes-unstable yet adorable protagonist and Hamill's eventual, true ally.",4,A Showcase of Mark Hamill and the Vegas of Yesteryear,1208131200,"04 14, 2008",2008,906,"['engaging', 'period', 'piece', 'high', 'school', 'grad', 'broken', 'home', 'gypsy-like', 'yet', 'caring', 'mother', 'altogether', 'absent', 'father', 'desperate', 'search', 'find', 'stolen', 'Vette', 'helped', 'restore', 'high', 'school', 'shop', 'class', 'Did', 'California', 'public', 'schools', 'have', 'funding', 'kind', 'project', 'back', '1978', 'Probably', 'not', 'movie', 'superb', 'showcase', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'physical', 'acting', 'ability', 'agility', 'natural', 'comedic', 'talent', 'great', 'historical', 'recording', 'Vegas', 'yesteryear', 'Also', 'great', 'plot', 'twist', 'bad', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'really', 'really', 'BAD', 'guys', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', 'even', 'back', '70s', 'was', 'not', 'common', 'thing', 'high', 'school', 'graduates', 'pursue', 'prostitution', 'career', 'choice', 'even', 'college', 'was', ""n't"", 'option', 'so', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'enjoy', 'Annie', 'Potts', 'comedic', 'portrayal', 'sometimes-unstable', 'yet', 'adorable', 'protagonist', 'Hamill', 'eventual', 'true', 'ally']",N/A

307375,A2QWXHB5IU8LCU,6302316405,David W. George,"[6, 6]","Well, I bought the DVD from Amazon (Thank You), and I realized I had forgotten a lot about this movie, which I hadn't seen in close to twenty years. Believe it or not, Mark Hamill is quite good as Kenny Dantley, a high school senior who rebuilds a junk Corvette in his auto-shop class, falls in love with it, and then loses it when it is stolen by the bad guys.  Hamill actually conveys more emotion in this movie than ""Star Wars"", the film which made him famous. Annie Potts, best known for her TV work on ""Designing Women"",is Vanessa, the hooker Kenny meets in Las Vegas while searching for the stolen Corvette. They have a pleasant, believable chemistry between them. Of course, the Corvette is the real star of the show, though it looks a lot more modified than I'd remembered; so much in fact, the front end of the vehicle doesn't really look like a Corvette. This movie was rated PG when it was released in 1978, but if it were released today, it would probably carry a PG-13 thanks to a brief topless scene by Potts (I'm not complaining).The DVD itself is no-frills, though it is in widescreen format and does include the trailer, which is in surprisingly good condition. The picture quality, in my opinion, is not bad, given the movie is from 1978 and probably not high on the film-restoration list at the studio. Some nighttime scenes are murky, but there are some daytime scenes which are remarkably crisp. The sound is good, particularly if you have a home theater system. The DVD is distributed by Warner Bros., though MGM was the studio that released the film to theaters.""Corvette Summer"" is a nice little movie that would probably never be made today.

I was hesitant to watch this because it's probably going to be another campy dated seventies teen flick (like The Van, Aloha Bobby and Rose, Car Wash, etc.) but it was a bit more realistic drama than any kind of comedy that's hard to appreciate being over 30 years old.But, I enjoyed this.  Mark Hamill played Kenny, a typical white trash high school student in the Los Angeles area, who lives with his sleezy white trash mother in a trailer park, and who has poor grades at school, but, has a passion for working on and restoring cars.  His first love in this film was to restore a Stingray Corvette.No sooner does he and some fellow students completely restore this Stingray Corvette, during a friend's test drive of the Corvette, it is stolen almost immediately.Kenny posts a picture of his Corvette at a gas station he works at, hoping someone will have seen it. He gets a clue from a passer-by that thinks he saw Kenny's Corvette in Las Vegas, so Kenny is determined to find his Corvette so he heads to Las Vegas.  There he meets who is soon to be is second love, a call girl wannabe named Vanessa, played by Annie Potts.Now, who in their right mind, could not love and appreciate Annie Potts?  She's cute as hell, has an adorable Bronx accent, and has incredible patience for Kenny as they work together to help his find his stolen Corvette.  Of course, Kenny's Corvette is there, but when he finally confronts the thieves, he learns that the conspiracy of the thief began at home with his auto body teacher (Ed McGrath) back at school in Los Angeles.  So, Kenny is confronted by his teacher, and is offered a job with the car thieves who also restore cars (although they restore stolen cars).  Kenny agrees but he has an alternate intention as he plays along till he and Vanessa make their move to get back his stolen Stingray Corvette.Yes, this was a great film to end my summer.
