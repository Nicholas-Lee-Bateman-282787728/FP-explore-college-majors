223579,A1PCQA29APBXFM,6300216950,Adorem,"[21, 22]","After making a series of acclaimed and controversial films in his native France, director Louis Malle made his American debut with this disturbing but visually beautiful story about Hattie (Susan Sarandon), a prostitute working in New Orleans' Storyville district at the turn of the century. When Hattie becomes pregnant, she opts to keep her baby and gives birth to a daughter named Violet, raising her in the brothel where she continues to work. Twelve years later, Violet (Brooke Shields) is old enough to attract the attentions of the brothel's customers, but emotionally has one foot in the adult world of her surroundings and the other in the navet&eacute; of childhood. With Hattie's consent, Violet's virginity is auctioned off to the customers of the house; but for Violet, the pull between childhood and adulthood becomes most clear - and most painful - when she draws the affections of Bellocq (Keith Carradine), a photographer who has been working on a photo series about Storyville prostitutes. Violet's blend of childlike innocence and adult sensuality is profoundly attractive to him, but their relationship quickly becomes problematic, especially when Hattie leaves Violet behind to get married.This movie also has a great  ragtime soundtrack  and this music helps with  the story too.",5,BROOKE  SPARKLES!!,1102377600,"12 7, 2004",2004,1301,"['making', 'series', 'acclaimed', 'controversial', 'films', 'native', 'France', 'director', 'Louis', 'Malle', 'made', 'American', 'debut', 'disturbing', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'story', 'Hattie', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'prostitute', 'working', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Storyville', 'district', 'turn', 'century', 'When', 'Hattie', 'pregnant', 'keep', 'baby', 'birth', 'daughter', 'named', 'Violet', 'raising', 'brothel', 'where', 'work', 'Twelve', 'years', 'later', 'Violet', 'Brooke', 'Shields', 'old', 'enough', 'attract', 'attentions', 'brothel', 'customers', 'emotionally', 'one', 'foot', 'adult', 'world', 'surroundings', 'other', 'navet', 'eacute', 'childhood', 'Hattie', 'consent', 'Violet', 'virginity', 'auctioned', 'customers', 'house', 'Violet', 'pull', 'childhood', 'adulthood', 'becomes', 'most', 'clear', 'most', 'painful', 'when', 'affections', 'Bellocq', 'Keith', 'Carradine', 'photographer', 'who', 'been', 'working', 'photo', 'series', 'Storyville', 'prostitutes', 'Violet', 'blend', 'childlike', 'innocence', 'adult', 'sensuality', 'profoundly', 'attractive', 'relationship', 'quickly', 'problematic', 'especially', 'when', 'Hattie', 'Violet', 'get', 'married.This', 'movie', 'also', 'great', 'ragtime', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'story', 'too']",Pretty Baby VHS

But the politics would 'take forever', and who is going to change your mind if this offends you? The story is well written and easy to follow;'The early 20th century and brothels'. This one just happens to have a young girl who is a prostitute. Seem that 'pedophilic' thoughts were more cultural and acceptable, rather than political.. up through the turn of the century, until 'the Temperance' movement affected alot of social 'order' and 'morality'. Brooke, who I had the pleasure of meeting in 1983: (despite the media) is a well balanced, nice, sweet, wonderful woman. Her posing nude, and being nude 'in the movie' at age 11, hasn't crippled her for life. People magazine in 1978 did an article about her - the 'controversy' about 'child porn'...front cover.(gasp)again the politics, and religion of it all. but the movie was not degrading, nor inciting what we hear today about 'child abuse' or 'harm'.. rather depictions, and documentary style (of the era) was painted into this movie, which for 1978 was no more shocking than Linda Blair vomiting all over a priest. like any cult favorite, you have to be a realist, and have an open mind about 'all' aspects of life; or you might think you have to start a political movement on behalf of eliminating more freedom of speech. There is no 'sex' in the movie; and ideally isn't 'pornographic' to the extent that many write their congress-person about. (many want Anne Franks diary banned!!)

One guy falls in love with a 12 year old and marries her. And the audience sees her, a 12 year old girl, naked. Common sense? I think it was okay for that time.

223586,A18SG6GL5EH8UQ,6300216950,Buddhasmom,"[1, 3]","So there's this whole backstory to my reasons for watching this movie.  First off, Brooke Shields is exactly one day younger than I am.  Exactly one day.  Throughout our lives I've often been reminded of the lottery of birth.  Whenever my life gets really bad, I think, well it could always be worse, I could be Brooke Shields, 6ft tall, money up the whazoo and a terrible yet working actress.When this movie came out, it was controversy all over the place, that's when I learned about our birthdays being one day apart.  I wanted to go see the movie, but being 13, my mother flatly denied access.  I thought it was crazy that I couldn't see a movie whose star was exactly my age.  Well, I didn't miss much.The thing about this movie is, it has all the ingredients to be a good story but it can't put it together.  For the record, it's not Brooke Shields fault.  She couldn't act at age 13, but they knew it wouldn't matter for this film.  They used her for her looks and wanted to make a controversial film and there it is in a nutshell.  But it really could have been something.  A real examination of our sexuality and morality.  It was debated at the time, but I don't think it was properly debated.  The debate mainly centered around how Brooke Shields mom could let her do the movie.The big issue is the subject matter but the bigger one was that Ms. Shields is shown naked in the film.  It really wasn't that big a deal in the movie but after I watched it, I recalled that that was the big deal.  What should have been the big deal was the issue of the males in the film lusting after her.  YUCK.  Yeah, that sums this movie up, I can't think of a better review.

223591,A3MSUAN2IXUC7G,6300216950,Denis L. Baggi,"[39, 50]","Great movies, like great literature, are capable of evoking a definite atmosphere, that of the time and setting of the story, the plot of which, then, almost loses significance. The atmosphere in this case is that of New Orleans at the turn of last century - a slight anachronism here sets the story in 1917 to match the timing of the closure of Storyville, New Orleans's red light district, located roughly between Rampart and Robeson, Iberville and St. Louis, of which nothing remains today. That atmosphere is well expressed by the music, especially that of the pianist in the movie, who is modeled after Jelly Roll Morton, a pioneer jazz pianist and composer, and plays his compositions. For the curious listener, I have listed here some of the works by Jelly Roll and when they get played in the movie:3:30 - 4:45,  Winin's Boy Blues #15:05 - 7:21, Tiger's Rag, from the typical NO repertory, including the tiger's roar24:35  - 25:00, Jelly Roll26:11 - 27:12, Thought I Heard Buddy Bolden Say #130:10 - 31:30, Winin' Boy Blues #238:39 - 43:20, (composing of ) King Porter Stomp, in the background when the Susan Sarandon character poses half-naked for the photographer54:46 - 56:35, (Original Jelly Roll?) Blues, with clarinet and bass1:47:15 - 1:49:15 BluesWe can add to this the sweet, though perhaps already outdated by 1917, music played by the New Orleans Ragtime Orchestra, with the nice Creole clarinet of Louis Cottrell, who used to play in the Preservation Hall.It is impossible to underestimate the importance of New Orleans in the world of culture, since it can be stated, as Jelly Roll Morton did, that it was for the musical world what Florence of the 14th and 15th century was for the visual arts. The fact that such culture flourished in whorehouses instead at the courts of princes is thus just a reflection of the cultural level of racist American society - which should be proud of its lupanars - which has prevented its own great culture to be accepted by its puritanical obsession, which led to the disaster of prohibition and the present overfilling of prisons for acts, such as possessing marijuana, which are not criminal in most of the civilized world.Beside the music, there are great moments in this movie. Brooke Shields, besides being pretty, has an interesting role, oscillating between her behavior as a future [prostitute] and that of an immature girl, with a lot of innocence - which incidentally is to be found among all those ladies certainly despised by the pseudo-moralistic mainstream, that same one which seems so popular these days in the US. The Madam looks like a true character, a worn out woman with distinguished manners who keeps up with absinthe and cocaine (not without some humor, as when she says: ""there are only two things you can do in a rainy day, and I don't like playing cards!""). And I am sure that the character of the distinguished photographer existed in reality, since I remember having seen an exhibition of pictures of such ladies taken in New Orleans at that time (in spite of the howling of some who wanted to label it degrading and censor it). Add to this the great photography, and the intelligence of Louis Malle, who has always used Jazz in a respectful way, as in ""Elevator to the Gallows"" with the music of Miles Davis and ""Murmur of Heart"" with that of Charlie Parker - the latter exploring an even more controversial subject than ""Pretty Baby"", that of an incest with the mother, in a poetic way.The only reason I am not giving this movie five stars is because I would have loved to see more of the Jelly Roll Morton character. One has almost to strain his/her ear to listen to his composing of the masterpiece ""King Porter Stomp"" while the photographer tries to take pictures of Hattie (Susan Sarandon). Perhaps some viewers may prefer Sarandon's naked tits over Morton's playing, but that's not my case!But on the whole this is a great movie and is to be recommended heartily to everybody, perhaps especially to Americans who generally know close to nothing of the great culture which has been created in the very places their society has systematically despised, by people which are still often considered as an inferior ""race"" (whatever that means).",4,Absolutely a great movie,1107216000,"02 1, 2005",2005,4230,"['Great', 'movies', 'great', 'literature', 'are', 'capable', 'evoking', 'definite', 'atmosphere', 'time', 'setting', 'story', 'plot', 'then', 'almost', 'significance', 'atmosphere', 'case', 'New', 'Orleans', 'turn', 'last', 'century', 'slight', 'anachronism', 'here', 'story', '1917', 'match', 'timing', 'closure', 'Storyville', 'New', 'Orleans', 'red', 'light', 'district', 'located', 'roughly', 'Rampart', 'Robeson', 'Iberville', 'St.', 'Louis', 'nothing', 'today', 'atmosphere', 'well', 'expressed', 'music', 'especially', 'pianist', 'movie', 'who', 'modeled', 'Jelly', 'Roll', 'Morton', 'pioneer', 'jazz', 'pianist', 'composer', 'compositions', 'curious', 'listener', 'have', 'listed', 'here', 'works', 'Jelly', 'Roll', 'when', 'get', 'played', 'movie:3:30', '4:45', 'Winin', 'Boy', 'Blues', '15:05', '7:21', 'Tiger', 'Rag', 'typical', 'NO', 'repertory', 'including', 'tiger', 'roar24:35', '25:00', 'Jelly', 'Roll26:11', '27:12', 'Thought', 'Heard', 'Buddy', 'Bolden', 'Say', '130:10', '31:30', 'Winin', 'Boy', 'Blues', '238:39', '43:20', 'composing', 'King', 'Porter', 'Stomp', 'background', 'when', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'character', 'half-naked', 'photographer54:46', '56:35', 'Original', 'Jelly', 'Roll', 'Blues', 'clarinet', 'bass1:47:15', '1:49:15', 'BluesWe', 'can', 'add', 'sweet', 'perhaps', 'already', 'outdated', '1917', 'music', 'played', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Ragtime', 'Orchestra', 'nice', 'Creole', 'clarinet', 'Louis', 'Cottrell', 'who', 'used', 'play', 'Preservation', 'Hall.It', 'impossible', 'underestimate', 'importance', 'New', 'Orleans', 'world', 'culture', 'can', 'be', 'stated', 'Jelly', 'Roll', 'Morton', 'did', 'was', 'musical', 'world', 'what', 'Florence', '14th', '15th', 'century', 'was', 'visual', 'arts', 'fact', 'such', 'culture', 'flourished', 'whorehouses', 'instead', 'courts', 'princes', 'thus', 'just', 'reflection', 'cultural', 'level', 'racist', 'American', 'society', 'should', 'be', 'proud', 'lupanars', 'prevented', 'own', 'great', 'culture', 'be', 'accepted', 'puritanical', 'obsession', 'led', 'disaster', 'prohibition', 'present', 'overfilling', 'prisons', 'acts', 'such', 'possessing', 'marijuana', 'are', 'not', 'criminal', 'most', 'civilized', 'music', 'are', 'great', 'moments', 'movie', 'Brooke', 'Shields', 'being', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'role', 'oscillating', 'behavior', 'future', '[', 'prostitute', ']', 'immature', 'girl', 'lot', 'innocence', 'incidentally', 'be', 'found', 'ladies', 'certainly', 'despised', 'pseudo-moralistic', 'mainstream', 'same', 'one', 'so', 'popular', 'days', 'US', 'Madam', 'true', 'character', 'worn', 'out', 'woman', 'distinguished', 'manners', 'who', 'up', 'absinthe', 'cocaine', 'not', 'humor', 'when', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'things', 'can', 'do', 'rainy', 'day', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'playing', 'cards', 'am', 'sure', 'character', 'distinguished', 'photographer', 'existed', 'reality', 'remember', 'having', 'seen', 'exhibition', 'pictures', 'such', 'ladies', 'taken', 'New', 'Orleans', 'time', 'spite', 'howling', 'who', 'wanted', 'label', 'degrading', 'censor', 'Add', 'great', 'photography', 'intelligence', 'Louis', 'Malle', 'who', 'always', 'used', 'Jazz', 'respectful', 'way', 'Elevator', 'Gallows', 'music', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'Murmur', 'Heart', 'Charlie', 'Parker', 'latter', 'exploring', 'even', 'more', 'controversial', 'subject', 'Pretty', 'Baby', 'incest', 'mother', 'poetic', 'way.The', 'only', 'reason', 'am', 'not', 'giving', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'more', 'Jelly', 'Roll', 'Morton', 'character', 'One', 'almost', 'strain', 'his/her', 'ear', 'listen', 'composing', 'masterpiece', 'King', 'Porter', 'Stomp', 'photographer', 'take', 'pictures', 'Hattie', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Perhaps', 'viewers', 'may', 'prefer', 'Sarandon', 'naked', 'tits', 'Morton', 'playing', 'not', 'case', 'whole', 'great', 'movie', 'be', 'recommended', 'heartily', 'everybody', 'perhaps', 'especially', 'Americans', 'who', 'generally', 'know', 'close', 'nothing', 'great', 'culture', 'been', 'created', 'very', 'society', 'systematically', 'despised', 'people', 'are', 'still', 'often', 'considered', 'inferior', 'race']",Pretty Baby VHS

Soon as I found that out, I quickly ordered it from amazon.com and it arrived in only a few days.I wish to comment on the following:QUALITY OF FILM TRANSFER TO DVD: Outstanding! Picture was very clear and sharp. Colors were lively and brilliant! No noticeable defects in even the least slightest degree.MUSICAL SCORE: Soundtrack was very beautifull and moving. It represented the time period very well. It definitely contributed to the athmosphere of the time period.SET DESIGN and WARDROBE: This movie reminded me of the motion picture TITANIC, in regards to the representation and superb accuracy of the time period depicted. Just like the musical score, the set design and costumes were very true to the finest detail.ACTING: All performers, to include the supporting cast,  did a remarkable job of acting. My favorite actress was Violet played by Brook Shields. She had this thick sassy southern accent and was remarkable for such a young age. The photographer who later married her was also very convincing. STORY: And now for the meat and main part of my review....I also own the movies LOLITA (Both versions), and BEAU PERE---which I received from amazon.com in a timely manner. These movies were HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL. They were a subject of much social/moral criticism! During all of this extreme negative press concerning these young girl movies, I never heard anything mentioned about PRETTY BABY...So I guess PRETTY BABY just sneaked right in and surprised me........AND BOY DID IT DO THAT!!!!!I knew the movie would be about a pre-teen prostitute...But I never would expect what the censors let the movie get away with!!!!!(a) 11 year old Brook Shields posing nude, a full body shot of her laying on a couch, from head to toes!(b) Several scenes of her walking around the house fully nude.(c) Many close-up shots of her bare chest.(d) Highly XXX dialogue, such as the line where 11 year old Violet tells her customer that ""I can feel the steam just coming thru my dress""(e) The absolutely unbelievable scene where Violet is teasing this 10 year old black boy about him being a virgin. She then later throws the boy to the ground and jumps on top of him. She continues to tease him while pulling down his pants. Just as she begins to engage in forced sex with him, this black maid enters the barn and scolds Violet and gives her this lecture on how wrong it is for a WHITE girl to breed with a BLACK person.I will save the other examples for you to discover and find out yourself! I do not want to ruin the surprise and SHOCK!In terms of controversey, moral standards, and censorship....this movie blows both versions of the movie LOLITA and BEAU PERE out of the water!!!I really thought the above mentioned movies were the only three mainstream movies out their that challenged the censorships with highly controversial young girl ""lolita"" content.....But I JUST FOUND OUT THEIR IS A ""FOURTH ONE"" OUT THEIR IN THE WILD CALLED ""PRETTY BABY"" THAT BLOWS THEM ALL OUT OF THE WATER!!!!!!For those of you that enjoy and search the world over for mainstream ""lolita type"" content movies....THIS IS A 100% DEFINITE MUST OWN MOVIE!!!!!!

I do not want to waste space and your time by going into detail about what the movie was about or plot specifics...you can find out that information by reading the MAIN DESCRIPTION at the beginning, or the MAIN REVIEW...also many reviewers quote and state the same story specifics over and over...Reviews are supposed to give an EVALUATION/RATING REVIEW, not tell the story over and over again in different fashions)",5,Absolutely UNBELIEVABLE!!!,1075680000,"02 2, 2004",2004,3621,"['was', 'very', 'happy', 'when', 'PRETTY', 'BABY', 'became', 'available', 'DVD', 'Soon', 'found', 'quickly', 'ordered', 'amazon.com', 'arrived', 'only', 'few', 'days.I', 'wish', 'comment', 'following', 'QUALITY', 'OF', 'FILM', 'TRANSFER', 'TO', 'DVD', 'Outstanding', 'Picture', 'was', 'very', 'clear', 'sharp', 'Colors', 'were', 'lively', 'brilliant', 'noticeable', 'defects', 'even', 'least', 'slightest', 'degree.MUSICAL', 'SCORE', 'Soundtrack', 'was', 'very', 'beautifull', 'moving', 'represented', 'time', 'period', 'very', 'well', 'definitely', 'contributed', 'athmosphere', 'time', 'period.SET', 'DESIGN', 'WARDROBE', 'movie', 'reminded', 'motion', 'picture', 'TITANIC', 'regards', 'representation', 'superb', 'accuracy', 'time', 'period', 'depicted', 'Just', 'musical', 'score', 'set', 'design', 'costumes', 'were', 'very', 'true', 'finest', 'detail.ACTING', 'performers', 'include', 'supporting', 'cast', 'did', 'remarkable', 'job', 'acting', 'favorite', 'actress', 'was', 'Violet', 'played', 'Brook', 'Shields', 'had', 'thick', 'sassy', 'southern', 'accent', 'was', 'remarkable', 'young', 'age', 'photographer', 'who', 'later', 'married', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'convincing', 'STORY', 'now', 'meat', 'main', 'part', 'review', '.I', 'also', 'own', 'movies', 'LOLITA', 'Both', 'versions', 'BEAU', 'PERE', '-which', 'received', 'amazon.com', 'timely', 'manner', 'movies', 'were', 'HIGHLY', 'CONTROVERSIAL', 'were', 'subject', 'much', 'social/moral', 'criticism', 'extreme', 'negative', 'press', 'concerning', 'young', 'girl', 'movies', 'never', 'heard', 'anything', 'mentioned', 'PRETTY', 'BABY', 'So', 'guess', 'PRETTY', 'BABY', 'just', 'sneaked', 'right', 'surprised', 'BOY', 'DID', 'IT', 'DO', 'knew', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'pre-teen', 'prostitute', 'never', 'would', 'expect', 'what', 'censors', 'let', 'movie', 'get', 'away', '11', 'year', 'old', 'Brook', 'Shields', 'posing', 'nude', 'full', 'body', 'shot', 'laying', 'couch', 'head', 'toes', 'b', 'Several', 'scenes', 'walking', 'house', 'fully', 'nude', 'c', 'Many', 'close-up', 'shots', 'bare', 'chest', 'd', 'Highly', 'XXX', 'dialogue', 'such', 'line', 'where', '11', 'year', 'old', 'Violet', 'customer', 'can', 'feel', 'steam', 'just', 'coming', 'thru', 'dress', 'e', 'absolutely', 'unbelievable', 'scene', 'where', 'Violet', 'teasing', '10', 'year', 'old', 'black', 'boy', 'being', 'virgin', 'then', 'later', 'boy', 'ground', 'jumps', 'top', 'tease', 'pulling', 'down', 'pants', 'Just', 'engage', 'forced', 'sex', 'black', 'maid', 'barn', 'scolds', 'Violet', 'lecture', 'how', 'wrong', 'WHITE', 'girl', 'breed', 'BLACK', 'person.I', 'will', 'save', 'other', 'examples', 'discover', 'find', 'out', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'ruin', 'surprise', 'SHOCK', 'terms', 'controversey', 'moral', 'standards', 'censorship', '.this', 'movie', 'versions', 'movie', 'LOLITA', 'BEAU', 'PERE', 'water', 'really', 'thought', 'above', 'mentioned', 'movies', 'were', 'only', 'three', 'mainstream', 'movies', 'out', 'challenged', 'censorships', 'highly', 'controversial', 'young', 'girl', 'lolita', 'content', '..But', 'JUST', 'FOUND', 'OUT', 'THEIR', 'FOURTH', 'ONE', 'OUT', 'THEIR', 'IN', 'THE', 'WILD', 'CALLED', 'PRETTY', 'BABY', 'THAT', 'BLOWS', 'THEM', 'ALL', 'OUT', 'THE', 'WATER', 'enjoy', 'search', 'world', 'mainstream', 'lolita', 'type', 'content', 'movies', '.THIS', '100', '%', 'DEFINITE', 'MUST', 'OWN', 'MOVIE', 'P.S', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'waste', 'space', 'time', 'going', 'detail', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'plot', 'specifics', 'can', 'find', 'out', 'information', 'reading', 'MAIN', 'DESCRIPTION', 'beginning', 'MAIN', 'REVIEW', 'also', 'many', 'reviewers', 'quote', 'state', 'same', 'story', 'specifics', 'Reviews', 'are', 'supposed', 'give', 'EVALUATION/RATING', 'REVIEW', 'not', 'tell', 'story', 'over', 'again', 'different', 'fashions']",Pretty Baby VHS
223593,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,6300216950,Dennis Littrell,"[40, 45]","Brooke Shields is as gorgeous as a little girl can be.  Her beauty really rivets you to the screen.  Louis Malle keeps the camera on her as often and for as long as possible, reminding me that some years ago Brooke Shields was the most photographed model in the world.  Susan Sarandon gets considerably upstaged.  However as far as acting goes, Brooke ranged from amateurish to competent to flashes of delight.  She was good, so good I would say in comparing her to later roles, that she has regressed.  But perhaps it was Louis Malle's direction that made her seem so natural.Sarandon was flawless and seamless as usual (and never looked better).  The long takes on the faces of the characters was noticeable but short of annoying.  The sets were almost magical.  They seemed so natural without all the usual, ""Look folks, this is 1917!"" kind of feeling you usually get with period piece photography.  The milieu of the whore house in New Orleans in which little Violet wanders about in every room and every nook and at any time, day or night, seems natural and unforced.  It's a huge child's playground in effect for the twelve-year-old who yearns to out-do mommie in being desirable to the johns.The story line is strangely reserved.  You keep expecting some real horror to explode in your face, and then you expect a heart sickening tragedy, Violet to be mutilated by one of her johns or perhaps exploited by some sick man, but the worst she gets is deflowered and slapped.  The madame of the house (played brilliantly by an actress whose name I don't know) has her whipped for something, but she skips away from that saying it didn't hurt and runs off to the photographer she likes, played perhaps too Victorianly by Keith Carradine.  I got the feeling he couldn't make up his mind whether he was Toulouse Lautrec, Vincent Van Gogh or Professor Henry Higgins and decided to go with all three.  I expected to see him grovel a little for Brooke, or debase himself &agrave; la Philip in Of Human Bondage, but Malle spares us that.The defining sequence in the movie, and the part that reveals the real tragedy of the little girl is when she goes to the photographer's house and they begin living together and he leaves her a note that she can't read (because she is illiterate) and we see her standing behind his iron fence watching the sailors walk by (perhaps the sailors are in her future).  When he comes home and we see that her child's view of the world is so different than his, we know their relationship is doomed.  But we also know that she has lost her childhood and will never have a normal adolescence.  That is her tragedy.The cinematography is beautiful without calling undue attention to itself.  The whore house seems real enough as a sort of French salon cum New Orleans brothel, cum Dodge City saloon. We see Brooke as close to naked as perhaps we would want.  The point of the photography is to show her physical beauty, but in a naturalistic, almost nonsexual way, to show the awkwardness of the child who is about to become a woman.  She never looks worse than when she's painted up and thick with lipstick.  We get the point.  In the scene where she is deflowered we are ""threatened"" with horror (she screams, the john sneaks out and they discover her motionless on the bed).  But she's only joking and they all get choked up at this ""rite of passage.""  Malle makes it like a first kiss, which for her (his point) it is.He gets to tell it like it is sometimes with young girls and men but spares us a lot of the shock by making it clear that Brooke Shields as Violet the 12-year-old prostitute is an exception to the general rule.  Yet nothing is hid from us.  The slavery of the prostitute's life and bondage to her trade is made clear.  The tragedy of growing up in a whore house is not glossed over; it's just that the tragedy is sugar coated like our memories of childhood, and indeed the little girl has a lot of fun in the old whore house and we know that some of her memories will be fond ones.Finally, Violet's mother comes back for her.  She has made a successful marriage with her rich respectable husband.  Violet goes to her and although her photographer husband objects, he knows it's inevitable: he must lose her.  She asks ""Can't you come too?""  We, along with Keith Carradine, get to fathom that for a long moment or two before he lets her go.  The great thing about this scene is that the arrival of the mother and her rich husband just destroys their ""marriage.""  Kaboom.  We immediately see that the child's higher loyalty and greater love is to and for the mother and not her husband and her marriage, a relationship she does not understand.It's a strange tale, bravely told with a touch of gentle genius.  I'm glad I didn't have to see all the warts, but I know they were there behind the gloss and Malle left them out on purpose: and the nearly idyllic world of the child prostitute is nothing like his fairy tale, but I thank him for it anyway; after all, these things have to be told in the form of fairy tales or myths otherwise we can't accept them.--Dennis Littrell, author of ""Cut to the Chaise

223595,A280GY5UVUS2QH,6300216950,Doug Anderson,"[78, 93]","Storyville, New Orleans. 1917. Brooke Shields(Violet) is the daughter of prostitute Susan Sarandon(Haddy). The camera follows Violet around and shows the goings on within the New Orleans style brothel mansion through her eyes. She is a surprisingly strong central character and the brothel provides a fairly stable family environment which sometimes seems more like a boarding school than a bawdy house. The old Madam looks out for her girls and the girls look out for each other. Shields is friends with both the colored Jazz pianist, the voodoo fortune teller, the worldly photographer as well the other little kids. Her childhood seems charmed, rich.Louis Malle in his earlier classic Murmur of the Heart examined bourgeois norms and found them to be far from moral, and in this movie he is examing what most deem an amoral atmosphere and finding much there that is admirable.  He is celebrating moral freedom within the rich and racially diverse culture of New Orleans and he is examining moral hypocrisy as all the patrons are the wealthy and ""respectable"". Malle sets up an equation that perhaps parodies the age old artist/patron relationship. The most obvious arts being patronised are the sensual arts but also  the mansion is a social club with its own jazz pianist, paintings on the wall, and there is a general joie de vivre that is lacking in the normal world. The brothel is seen as a kind of timeless sanctuary of the better things in life. Birth and death are kept out of the main parlor to preserve this illusion. At the end as this world that Malle and Nykvist have so carefully put together comes apart the mood is one of regret that it can't keep going on. This is not a message film and Malle is a director who does not insist you see things any particular way. Certainly the young Brooke Shields appearing as she does is meant to shock and no one thinks  little girls should grow up to be prostitutes but the other extreme of growing up in the narrow confines of puritanical mainstream America also has its limits. The former world is amoral but it is lively and awakens the imagination and senses, the latter world is moral but overly protective and stultifying.Malle leaves things unresolved and the photographer played by Kieth Carradine embodies the ambivalence best of all.  Carradine is attracted to the prostitutes existence, and he seems at home with them(much in the same way an artist in the same period found himself at home in Paris)but he keeps his distance for awhile, treating them only as art objects. Once he steps over his own bounds though he becomes as morally questionable as the prostitutes themselves. At the end he is still divided as to what is the best life for young Violet.  So among everything else in the movie you have this little allegory of the bohemian artist as well.

I never saw it but was disgusted & horrified by a child being used and exposed to sexuality in any form. I am now 58 and incredibly surprised at being fascinated rather than triggered in light of my history.  I was molested at age 3 & 7 and, no surprise. married a very damaged man who tramatized me regularly w/ his kinky perverse sexual demands. With my early history I had a high tolerance for aberrant behavior and stayed w/ this guy for 28yrs until discovering I had 3 STDs and he confessed to his very twisted and prolific sick double life as a sex addict. I also learned he molested our daughter when she was 3 the same as he did w/ his baby sister when he was 12 (she commited suicide in her late teens).It's been 7yrs and despite being w/ a healthy wonderfully decent honorable man, I continue to deal w/ extreme PTSD on a daily basis.Needless to say I was braced for major trauma in watching this movie. However on the contrary it was beautifully done portraying a real piece of history. It was naturally horrible that prostitution was one of the few job options for a woman w/o means to support herself, but there was a bazaar sweetness of family and respect that kept it from being lewd and dirty. Very much like ""Dangerous Beauty"", the story of Veronica Franco, the last of a real life Courtesan of the 16th century. (Who by the way included Cleopatra!)Please know I am in no way condoning the sexual exploitation of children here. Though I have great grandmothers who married at 14 and had children which was not uncommon in these times, 11/12 yrs old is beyond sick.

It told the story of the way things were back then.  Life now is much different than it was in the early party of the last century and I think this film shows the ugliness of the brothels of that era.  Poor Violet having her virginity auctioned and really not knowing any better.  When the creepy old guy pays the money, it made me feel sick to my stomach.  I guess that was the point of the movie.

'Pretty Baby' is a testament to the fact that the 70's were vastly more liberated than our times, at least when it comes to sexuality. In here pretty baby is twelve-year-old Violet, played by Brooke Shields. Violet has grown in the environment of a circa World War I whorehouse in New Orleans, where her mother Hattie (Susan Sarandon) practices the oldest of professions. She still acts like a child, one who likes to chase lizards in the underbrush and who throws tantrums when she doesn't get her way. When her mother leaves the brothel to start a respectable life, Violet remains and allows her virginity to be auctioned off to the highest bidder.  She finds herself drawn to a photographer, Bellocq, who is taking portraits of Storyville prostitutes.  Realizing that she is love, the young Violet declares her intention to marry Bellocq...Brook performance literally carries this movie. Yes, the movie is quite explicit about the business of prostitution during that time, but it is never exploited and gives one the sense of how it really was, and what might happen to children born into prostitution. Malle's dispassionate take on all of this outraged viewers a quarter-century ago, but it all seems rather tame today. Perhaps too tame.........Malle's restraint is so great at times that one wishes he'd pushed the envelope even more. But he got an amazing performance out of Shields, one that she never topped in her career as an actress -- Violet is a mesmerizing combination of innocent child and sly young woman, and that we never see her as a victim is to both her credit and Malle's. Some of the other acting in the film is less impressive, especially Frances Faye as the brothel's elderly owner, Nell -- she's simply horrible, turning in one of the worst performances seen outside of early John Waters' movies. Still, it's a beautiful movie. Its slow pace may frustrate some viewers, but 'Pretty Baby' is a gorgeous, emotionally stunning experience.",4,I love you once. I love you twice.

223610,A18NQ824DQTRK2,6300216950,kboy2008,"[2, 7]","I really liked the story it was well writen and very well acted. They did a good job of bring the past alive, this brothel was not a safe happy place. They start the movie with a nice plesent scene, violet is roaming around with the paino playing and every seems happy but it doesn't take long and this world to be shown in the light and the happness is empty...To really understand this movie one must understand the time it was set in 1917, WWI had been raging for 4 years and everyone's mind set was one of shock and fear no one beleived they lived in a safe world, but go back 5 or 6 years ealery and the mind set was totaly different and ppl were livng in a fantasy world where they beleived they were safe and the world around them was a safe one. Open scene Violet is skiping happly through the brothel she lives in without a care of fear in the world and beleving her world is a safe one, her mother on the other hand was wiser and older and she knew the hell she was living in. I liked the 2 adventures these two ladies took, it made the story more beleiveable and it also made you understand why they mde the choices they made. For example at early point in the movie when Violet's mother wanted to leave and how Violet wouldn't leave, that made total since to me, there was no reason for her to leave let she thought she had everything she wanted she was living in her fanstay pre WWI world. Than when Violet's mother does leave and they begin to shater her world and the cold truth of life in a brothel is revealed to her it makes those parts even more powerful. I liked the parts where the guy was shooting the gun radomly into the air, the part where they auctioned off Violet, and also the part where Violet was in the bath and the old women came up to show her off, and finaly the part where they was thrown out into the streets, thoes were all great parts of the movie the added to show Violet what the real world is like also helped to grow her charecter so at the end when she faces the same choice she had in the begining she knows the dangers of the real world and makes the right choice, and if nothing had happened to shater her world the choice she made wouldn't have made any since.It is a wonderful story the only problem I had with the movie is I didn't really care to have a 12 year old girl running around nude in this movie, yes because of the setting of the movie it wouldn't have made any since not to inculde them I just think they should have found an 18 year old girl that looked like brook shields for a stand in. My second problem with this movie is they were way to easy on the guy who married Violet, he hit, had sex with and threw out a naked 12 year old girl into the streets, he should have either been sent to prison for life or shot by the end of the movie, not just let off with a broken heart. Other than that I really enjoyed this movie",4,Good story.,1260316800,"12 9, 2009",2009,2883,"['really', 'liked', 'story', 'was', 'well', 'writen', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'bring', 'past', 'alive', 'brothel', 'was', 'not', 'safe', 'happy', 'place', 'start', 'movie', 'nice', 'plesent', 'scene', 'violet', 'roaming', 'around', 'paino', 'playing', 'happy', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'world', 'be', 'shown', 'light', 'happness', 'empty', 'really', 'understand', 'movie', 'one', 'must', 'understand', 'time', 'was', 'set', '1917', 'WWI', 'had', 'been', 'raging', '4', 'years', 'everyone', 'mind', 'set', 'was', 'one', 'shock', 'fear', 'one', 'beleived', 'lived', 'safe', 'world', 'go', 'back', '5', '6', 'years', 'ealery', 'mind', 'set', 'was', 'totaly', 'different', 'ppl', 'were', 'livng', 'fantasy', 'world', 'where', 'beleived', 'were', 'safe', 'world', 'was', 'safe', 'one', 'Open', 'scene', 'Violet', 'skiping', 'happly', 'brothel', 'care', 'fear', 'world', 'beleving', 'world', 'safe', 'one', 'mother', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'wiser', 'older', 'knew', 'hell', 'was', 'living', 'liked', '2', 'adventures', 'two', 'ladies', 'took', 'made', 'story', 'more', 'beleiveable', 'also', 'made', 'understand', 'why', 'mde', 'choices', 'made', 'example', 'early', 'point', 'movie', 'when', 'Violet', 'mother', 'wanted', 'leave', 'how', 'Violet', 'would', ""n't"", 'leave', 'made', 'total', 'was', 'reason', 'leave', 'let', 'thought', 'had', 'everything', 'wanted', 'was', 'living', 'fanstay', 'pre', 'WWI', 'world', 'Than', 'when', 'Violet', 'mother', 'leave', 'begin', 'shater', 'world', 'cold', 'truth', 'life', 'brothel', 'revealed', 'parts', 'even', 'more', 'powerful', 'liked', 'parts', 'where', 'guy', 'was', 'shooting', 'gun', 'radomly', 'air', 'part', 'where', 'auctioned', 'off', 'Violet', 'also', 'part', 'where', 'Violet', 'was', 'bath', 'old', 'women', 'came', 'up', 'show', 'off', 'finaly', 'part', 'where', 'was', 'thrown', 'out', 'streets', 'thoes', 'were', 'great', 'parts', 'movie', 'added', 'show', 'Violet', 'what', 'real', 'world', 'also', 'helped', 'grow', 'charecter', 'so', 'end', 'when', 'same', 'choice', 'had', 'begining', 'dangers', 'real', 'world', 'right', 'choice', 'nothing', 'had', 'happened', 'shater', 'world', 'choice', 'made', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'since.It', 'wonderful', 'story', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'have', '12', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'running', 'around', 'nude', 'movie', 'yes', 'setting', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'not', 'inculde', 'just', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'found', '18', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'looked', 'brook', 'shields', 'stand', 'second', 'problem', 'movie', 'were', 'way', 'easy', 'guy', 'who', 'married', 'Violet', 'hit', 'had', 'sex', 'threw', 'out', 'naked', '12', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'streets', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'sent', 'prison', 'life', 'shot', 'end', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'let', 'off', 'broken', 'heart', 'Other', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie']",Pretty Baby VHS

Brooke Shield's mom knew what to use with Brooke when she was just such a child star.  While these days we see Lolita more in the music visual genre (ex. Britney Spears), Brooke was one of the sexiest young girls ever to grace the silver screen.  While more famous for the nearly nude scenes in Blue Lagoon, this was a movie that has since fallen into the slush pile but had her reputation solidified as Lolita.Brooke is a twelve year old girl whose mother, Susan Sarandon, runs a brothel in New Orleans around the turn of the twentieth century.  As Brooke is turning twelve, she is ready to be sold as a baby prostitute in her mother's brothel.  Brooke rarely dresses in a provacative way, she wears make up with the terrible heavy hand that only a twelve year old can apply to her own face.  She's cute, sweet, innocent, and childlike.  What man wouldn't bid on her virginity?  *Shudder*It was more of the thought that things like this really happen in the world that made us think.  And to think that Brooke herself was being sold to the highest bidder to star in a movie about this is what made us cluck our tongues.  What a horror story.But it worked for Brooke and her mom.  Unlike her counterpart child stars who would fall apart from the stereotypical child star fast life, Brooke grew up to be a well adjusted, well educated, and very successful adult.

There are no explosions that throw bodies through the air, no sensational car crashes, no severed human limbs.  Rather there is a plot that unfolds on its own good time, well drawn characters, excellently written dialogue, perfect atmosphere, and gorgeous photography.Still, I understand why some might find the film objectionable.  There is nudity, even nudity of a pubescent girl.  There is open talk of sex.  And some quasi moralists are more offended by that than by graphic violence.  Sex, of course, is part of life and is legal, but it must not be shown or suggested very clearly.  Murder, on the other hand, is illegal but is shown every night on TV with little protest from the moralists.The acting here is seamless.  Susan Sarandon gives her best performance, as does Brook Shields.  But the performance that I found most startling was that of the bordello madame.There was an area of New Orleans called Storyville, for some 20 years, where prostitution was confined, ending about World War I.  That much of the plot is true.  And the photographer Bellocq existed; some of his art has survived.

(See this descent in her jarring overacting in ""Children of Dune; marring an otherwise excellent adaptation.)The ""scandal"" is highly overblown.  As for the movie ""being unable to be made today"", that's an odd statement.  Thora Birch went topless at the age of seventeen. Kirsten Dunst engaged in full mouth kiss with Brad Pitt in ""Vampire"", and Led Zeppelin's ""Houses of Holy"" with dozens of naked children on it, can still be bought even at Wal-Mart and BestBuy.  I know of no prosecurtor who has brought charges of child porn against the producers of any of these films or the parents of the children. And this movie's still obviously available to everyone within the US by its mere presence on Amazon.Even more notable is that the ""scandalous"" scenes haven't been cut in an ""abridged"" version by the supposedly craven studio(s).  However, this could be due to Malle's ownership of it.If this film really was child porn does anyone think Amazon would sell it?Frankly, this movie's tame compared to much of garbage readily available, 24-7, thanks to the wonders of cable.The difference?  Malle's work has clear, artistic intent.  The nude scenes of the sparkling beauty of Shields, those eyes even then so powerful, were necessary to the plot.  Doubltess, controversy in the Anglo-Saxon world wasn't unanticipated, and certainly added to the box office; but its (obviously) enduring popularity is proven by its presence here.As for the film itself, like all of Malle's work, it's a love-hate affair.

I agree totally that the nudity is too much, especially because Violet is so young.  It's disturbing to see.  In other movies with nude kids, they aren't sexual roles, and this one is, which is hard to watch at times.  But the story is good, though quite sad, to see this young girl who doesn't know any better being sold off to the highest bidder to ""get her cherry popped"" as they put it.One reviewer on here said, and I quote: ""If they gave Academy Awards for small moments, this film would deserve one for the scene in which Violet is being auctioned off, and the camera closes in on the eyes of the Black piano player, full of silent moral judgment.""  I disagree that he was full of silent moral judgment.  I had the feeling, watching his reactions, that he wanted to save Violet because she was a child being auctioned off for her first time.  I thought he was going to bid on her to save her, but of course he didn't do that, and later on in the barn, the older black woman tells Violet that ""the black ones never go upstairs"" so that explained to me why he didn't try to bid on her, besides probably being broke.  I don't imagine he was paid much for being the piano player there.Ultimately, the movie made me very sad, knowing that things like this went on and probably still do at brothels.  It was well done. I just wish they hadn't shown so much of Violet's body.. I kept thinking that it would attract pedophiles, which made me feel sick to my stomach.  I doubt I'll watch it again for that reason, even though I like the story.By the way, this wasn't Brooke Shields' film debut like the description says.

The photography is beautiful, and the director captured an atmosphere within the film that draws you in though you feel like you should look away.  I appreciate the honesty in the film.  Whether you will like it may depend on what you expect when you watch a film.  I watched it because I was curious about that lifestyle and had seen Brooke in sillier films when I was young.  It's a gutsy film, and it is sickening when you see a twelve-year old child auctioned off to an old man to use; not to mention her mother who coaches her on how to get the best tips.  But that is probably a more honest depiction than you might see in some films.  I rated it high for the creativity and the photography.
