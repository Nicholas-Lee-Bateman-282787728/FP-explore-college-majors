1281518,A33L7G4E8CID3,B002OOWKSA,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[10, 17]","I'm a Curb fan from way back, and one who's been in it for the long haul, from the legendary early seasons through the much weaker seasons 4 and 5 (c'mon, let's just come to terms here) and then onto the quite excellent sixth installment. But I must insist that this season isn't that good, despite some wonderful moments.What bothers me about this seasons is...well, it's hard to say. I could say that it's not realistic, but that's sort of a silly comment to make of a series that has always had a somewhat heightened reality. Larry is the ultimate put-upon man, a guy whose feeling that the whole world is aligned against him often just seems to be obvious. The goal here isn't really to be realistic, but to achieve sort of a heightened sense of reality. But too often in this season Curb veers away from heightened reality and into plain wackiness. There is a scene in one episode where Ted Danson forces a desert upon Larry about half a dozen times that pretty much exemplifies what I'm talking about here. It's pushing just a little too hard, bending the reality just a little too far, so that it screws up the delicate balance that Curb at its best often hits. This extends into some of Larry's other relationships, too. Last season's episode where all of Larry's friends verbally chose whether to side with Larry or Cheryl was kind of an example of this as well, but when you see scenes like one from the first episode, where Funkhauser first says Larry can have liquids from his fridge and then gets furious with him for getting a soda is a sign that Curb has exhausted the territory it's been mining from the start, and now seems more interested in going for bigger and bigger reactions in order to stay relevant. And while the Seinfeld plotline does have some moments (especially with Michael Richards), it's only fitfully funny most of the way through. The idea that last-place NBC wouldn't let Larry David get away with anything in exchange for a Seinfeld reunion is, um, not particularly realistic, but at least the episode where they actually show the Seinfeld ""reunion"" show is a good one.It's a shame that Curb so frequently loses its balance here, because there's some good stuff here beside the final episode. ""Vehicular Fellatio"" is the show firing on all cylinders, a tightly plotted cycle of ridiculousness that actually builds upon its jokes and mostly sticks to the classic Curb reality. ""Denise Handicapped"" is the show being gleefully politically incorrect in absolutely the best way possible, by refusing to valorize the disabled and portraying them as the same sort of insecure and flawed people as the rest of us, and the episode has some of the sharpest and most natural characterization that the show's ever pulled off. And while ""The Black Swan"" has a few problems, the idea of Larry as a bully ruling his golf club through fear, intimidation and poor tips is a delicious one, in any event. This season is, if anything, a mild dip in the Curb canon. The show is, I feel, still strong enough to merit your attention, but one that is beginning to show signs of its age. There is a reason why very, very few shows make it seven seasons, especially comedies. Frankly, Larry should have ended the show on a high note and wrapped it up with Season 6, but time will tell if he has another sixth season (so to speak) in him.",3,The seams are showing,1276473600,"06 14, 2010",2010,3349,"[""'m"", 'Curb', 'fan', 'way', 'back', 'one', 'who', 'been', 'long', 'haul', 'legendary', 'early', 'seasons', 'much', 'weaker', 'seasons', '4', '5', ""c'mon"", 'let', 'just', 'come', 'terms', 'here', 'then', 'quite', 'excellent', 'sixth', 'installment', 'must', 'insist', 'season', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'wonderful', 'moments.What', 'bothers', 'seasons', 'well', 'hard', 'say', 'could', 'say', 'not', 'realistic', 'sort', 'silly', 'comment', 'make', 'series', 'always', 'had', 'somewhat', 'heightened', 'reality', 'Larry', 'ultimate', 'put-upon', 'man', 'guy', 'feeling', 'whole', 'world', 'aligned', 'often', 'just', 'be', 'obvious', 'goal', 'here', ""n't"", 'really', 'be', 'realistic', 'achieve', 'sort', 'heightened', 'sense', 'reality', 'too', 'often', 'season', 'Curb', 'veers', 'away', 'heightened', 'reality', 'plain', 'wackiness', 'scene', 'one', 'episode', 'where', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'desert', 'Larry', 'dozen', 'times', 'pretty', 'much', 'exemplifies', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'here', 'pushing', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'hard', 'bending', 'reality', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'up', 'delicate', 'balance', 'Curb', 'best', 'often', 'Larry', 'other', 'relationships', 'too', 'Last', 'season', 'episode', 'where', 'Larry', 'friends', 'verbally', 'chose', 'side', 'Larry', 'Cheryl', 'was', 'kind', 'example', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'see', 'scenes', 'one', 'first', 'episode', 'where', 'Funkhauser', 'first', 'Larry', 'can', 'have', 'liquids', 'fridge', 'then', 'furious', 'getting', 'soda', 'sign', 'Curb', 'exhausted', 'territory', 'been', 'mining', 'start', 'now', 'more', 'interested', 'going', 'bigger', 'bigger', 'reactions', 'order', 'stay', 'relevant', 'Seinfeld', 'plotline', 'have', 'moments', 'especially', 'Michael', 'Richards', 'only', 'fitfully', 'funny', 'most', 'way', 'idea', 'last-place', 'NBC', 'would', ""n't"", 'let', 'Larry', 'David', 'get', 'away', 'anything', 'exchange', 'Seinfeld', 'reunion', 'um', 'not', 'particularly', 'realistic', 'least', 'episode', 'where', 'actually', 'show', 'Seinfeld', 'reunion', 'show', 'good', 'one.It', 'shame', 'Curb', 'so', 'frequently', 'balance', 'here', 'good', 'stuff', 'here', 'final', 'episode', 'Vehicular', 'Fellatio', 'show', 'firing', 'cylinders', 'tightly', 'plotted', 'cycle', 'ridiculousness', 'actually', 'jokes', 'mostly', 'sticks', 'classic', 'Curb', 'reality', 'Denise', 'Handicapped', 'show', 'being', 'gleefully', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'absolutely', 'best', 'way', 'possible', 'refusing', 'valorize', 'disabled', 'portraying', 'same', 'sort', 'insecure', 'flawed', 'people', 'rest', 'episode', 'sharpest', 'most', 'natural', 'characterization', 'show', 'ever', 'pulled', 'off', 'Black', 'Swan', 'few', 'problems', 'idea', 'Larry', 'bully', 'ruling', 'golf', 'club', 'fear', 'intimidation', 'poor', 'tips', 'delicious', 'one', 'event', 'season', 'anything', 'mild', 'dip', 'Curb', 'canon', 'show', 'feel', 'still', 'strong', 'enough', 'merit', 'attention', 'one', 'beginning', 'show', 'signs', 'age', 'reason', 'why', 'very', 'very', 'few', 'shows', 'make', 'seven', 'seasons', 'especially', 'comedies', 'Frankly', 'Larry', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'show', 'high', 'note', 'wrapped', 'up', 'Season', '6', 'time', 'will', 'tell', 'sixth', 'season', 'so', 'speak']",N/A

If you are a Seinfeld fan, you must see the last episode of this season even if you do not like this show.  I am a fan of both so was in heaven!Original Review:I just watched Larry David do a send up of Michael Richards' infamous ""N"" word rant to a heckler on this season.  David uses the real Richards (Kramer) with the black comedian who lives with him on the show.  This is typical of Larry David, who considers nothing too sensitive for comedic exploration.  This is one big reason why I love this show.  Larry David has to be the most Politically Incorrect Person in America and I love him for it!There are just so many funny things this season that any reviewer could write a small book about the joys of Season 7.  We open with his girlfriend having breast cancer and Larry's wanting to end the relationship.  Somehow he manages to find a therapist who ends up blaming him for the cancer! (As a cancer patient, I found this whole cancer episode very funny.) We revisit his mother's death via her tombstone and Larry even manages to get the tombstone cutter mad at him.  He becomes persona non grata at his country club after killing another member by making him mad and the guy had high blood pressure (which explodes), all over the inanity of playing through, or not, in golf. He wears women's underwear as an alibi for Suzie's husband when she finds panties in his glove compartment. He and Richard Lewis seriously come unhinged together again--Lewis and David have a friendship which thrives on maximum antagonism and misunderstanding.  Then there is the biggest thing going on in Season 7: Larry decides to put on a Seinfeld reunion. He does so as only Larry could where you see the reunion coming together behind the scenes.  You are not left out of anything in the entire process.  The major thing you discover doing this is how much of Seinfeld was Larry--tons.  When George (Jason Alexander) and Larry come together, it is clear that George WAS Larry.  They are mirrors of one another, willing to obsess and argue over any minutiae.This may be the best season yet of this show.  I hope Larry David keeps doing it.

Genius comedy is rare, what with the rubbish coming out the udders of mass culture, and all that, but thankfully, Curb Your Enthusiasm ranks with the brightest telly can offer. Larry David is an absolute genius like Ricky Gervais, that Heidegger bloke and Woody Allen.I love his writing and rank Curb with The Office and Cheers as one of funniest shows ever. My girlfriend and I can't get enough of Larry David, and even though he is 70 and should be taking it easy, he is still doing the do, like shouting at poor people and young girls, but in a funny way. (I hope that made sense). I just had a funny vision of Hank Moody, from Californication, playing Larrys character...  Let's write him a letter.What I mean is, Larry David's character is constantly harassed and bothered by poor people, that is, Hollywood's zero's who work in shopping malls and restaurants, and who dare to appear in front of Larry David's face; grrr!! Cue hilarious adventures. Hank Moody has similar adventures and both shows are set in Hollywood and its just as hilarious, which is the point. Many reviewers are offended by Larry Davids character, but they are really missing the point.A slight problemo. When Larry David's character is forced to sneer in an aloof but funny manner at a young nurse, it goes deeper than an old man sneering aloof because, I'm not being ageist (is that even a word), but the very old should be meditating, or whatever Hollywood types are in to these days; well its Larry so we can let him off! Hank Moody would be funnier mind, hence my Hank Moody ref.. Fortune favours the old tho.. This is the magic of Curb Your Enthusiasm. If you wanna get depressed, this aint the place to be. Its funnier that Notes from Underground you see (that didn't make sense too.. Oops!)So we see Larry David arguing with a waiter over why he should pay a tip, this would be funny if it wasn't for Larry David's own admission that he is indeed a millionaire, and so the joke hurt my sides as advertised. Larry David as a persecuted victim of those horrid Murlocks from H.G. Wells: The Time Machine, is a funny turn of events. Funnier still, Larry David hilariously shouts down aggressive female nurses who display annoying behaviour, like attending sick cues with those annoying sick people and LArry gets the once in a lifetime opportunity to humiliate a ridiculous shoe salesman (you have to see it for yourself). Larry David must be completely bonkers if he believes that laughing at workers is a source of insight; but it works, trust me, and this is why the man is a genius. Only in Hollywood can this be funny. We plebes will never get the chance to insult people like Larry David does and still be allowed in the community and this is why watching Larry David do it for us is so much fun. Those working class people are sooo 20th century and they deserve Larrys fire and brimstone. What's his next trick, bringing back sterilisation for the poor?Its the originality that I like. Larry David as a sneeringly repressed Hollywood writer, who sees himself as a crucified Outsider, with a dumb wife, young enough to be his victim, and a mansion with a high fence, is great. Larry doesn't just hate the poor, as he condemns the mind-set of the self regarding moneyed comrades he is forced to toil with, on a day to day basis. Give him an axe and Curb Your Enthusiasm is even funnier that American Psycho! Sorry to all the Ellis fans out there.Curb Your Enthusiasm is  a frikin masterpiece and Larry David is a great writer. Though you could argue that he only writes for millionaires and for those who believe that millionairehood is a mere few generations away. If you find shouting at the plebs and condemning their taste in shoes hilarious and if you yearn for Victorian values, but in a funny way, then you will love this. I loved it too, but I did feel guilty for doing so, so I'll let myself off!Curb Your Enthusiasm will go down in the annals of rib ticklers that reached the very heights of absurdist masterpieces.

1281543,A3DHDS5HDFE6IX,B002OOWKSA,kerouac's ghost,"[9, 16]","Larry David has been a personal hero.  A misunderstood guy one could relate to as the pinheads around him bowed to ridiculous sensitivies and absurdities due to all forms of correctness (political and otherwise).  He was the guy who would say what I thought.  I viewed Larry as just about the only guy on TV who viewed the world as it really is.  The situations he found himself in, though often outrageous, seemed to develop from most of the world just being totally full of crap.  Larry David's world view never seemed contrived to me, though some of the situations that sprung from that view had to be for comedic effect.In Season 7, it seems clear the show hit it's stride a couple of years back and is now in wind down mode.  Rather than stories that illustrate to the faithful that Larry is the only sane man running around greater Los Angeles, getting in trouble because of innocent insensitivities, his character now seems to exist simply as a catalyst to make weird things happen (for the sake of making weird things happen).  The heart, and point of view, has been significantly eroded in order to try and shock the audience (a tactic usually employed when fresh ideas are in short supply).  An example of this can be seen in ""Denise Handicap"" when David asks the parents of a child of Asian descent, ""Have you noticed if she has any procilivity for chopsticks?""  Thud.In the past, David's character might ask a question that a reasonable person (I think there are four left in the U.S.) might consider legitimate, but it's funny because of the knowledge it is considered incorrect in ""polite society"".  The episode ""The Surrogate"" comes to mind where David uses the word ""mulatto"" to the horror of those around him.  However, it makes sense.  Mulatto is a word that used to be in common use and a person like David would view it as just a word that simply describes a particular mix of race.  You sympathize with his character's point of view.  When David's character asks the chopsticks question, you just think...contrived.From my perspective the show was always funny, and different, because of a very special dynamic.  ""We"" know Larry is the sane one and everyone else is nuts.  However, when you have an episode where he is plotting a way to break up with his girlfriend before she gets test results for cancer, it doesn't seem edgy or risky (and it certainly doesn't seem like David is the sane one anymore), it just seems...contrived.  Even when he used his mother's death, a few years back, to get out of obligations, it made sense to his character.  Mom was past hurting.  Why not get some benefit out of it?  The ""cancer episode"" has none of that vibe.The same with the episode (the title escapes me) where one of David's co-workers has a daughter (a very young daughter) with a rash on her genitals.  The whole joke is using the slang word for female genitals (not the C word, but the P word) in the context of a child.  I know it is supposed to be out there and edgy and attention grabbing (""They'll say anything on that Larry David show!  Those whacky bastards!""), but in the end it just seems...yes, contrived.It seems instead of trying to come up with story lines that are funny and underscore that philosophical heart I alluded to earlier (Larry is the sane one in an insane world), David and crew are simply trying to be outrageous.  This fails because it isn't true to the character that we have seen (for the most part) get screwed over time and again because everyone else is nuts.  In addition, it is all so obviously manufactured (didn't want to use contrived again) in an attempt to shock (can people even be shocked anymore?).Hey, the series is still funny (and funnier than just about everything else on TV), but these characters are where the Seinfeld characters were about the same season in their run.  Almost out of ideas and a little desperate to do something OUTRAGEOUS!.

1281545,A356RFKNIG043B,B002OOWKSA,K. Swanson,"[4, 5]","4.5 starsIn some ways this season continues the slowing down of this entire concept...but when the Seinfeld reunion hits, the old Larry is jumpstarted and there are some truly classic scenes. The best of the best for me, as a huge fan of the finest writing on Seinfeld, mostly courtesy Larry and Jerry, are the scenes of them alone together, especially in the car, when you can see Larry come completely alive, his face glowing with real amusement and humor. That's the very essence of why Seinfeld was one of the ultimate comedy series: those two comic minds at play with each other. These guys are true friends, two peas in a pod, and you can see that with full transparency in their bits together here, the car scene above all; that feels like them at their very happiest. It's perfect karma to have a friend that inspires you like that.Clearly, these two are the Lennon and McCartney of comedy.Having said that, Lar reuses many many bits from earlier Curb seasons in season seven, whether as self-conscious homage/parody or sheer ennui is hard to say. Sometimes it works and sometimes it's flat, but then again the improv nature of this show means stale Curb is like fresh most any other comedy show. I did like him as a single guy here; more interaction with more people makes for more new jokes. When Cheryl comes back it's nice but Larry just isn't as funny with her around.The early episodes here are good but the last few are much better, though all have their moments and even at its worst Curb is twice as funny as most other shows out there today. The Black Swan is a highlight, and it's nice in each episode to see Larry being ever more honest about himself, his tipping habits, his all-too-logical curmudgeonly ways, and even pushing the envelope with the rash thing. Most episodes still wrap up each disparate thread nicely, a la Seinfeld.And the last episode is the real winner, as we get to see how Larry's life and the twin fictional lives of this LD and the Seinfeld universe intertwine. The self-referential Escheresque quality of the Curb Larry staging a Seinfeld reunion to get back his ex (who really did flee like Madoff with his money in real life), and how it all plays out with everyone acting not as themselves but LD's conception of them, is a mindgame of the highest order and quite brilliant in many ways, particularly the shot of LD and Cheryl watching George and his ex on tv. One can only marvel at how weird it must be to be Larry David, a malcontent billionaire comic that everyone loves for playing himself, but not quite, on tv.It's not as good as the first few seasons of Curb, but when it's good it's great, and once again Larry David delivers the goods in that twisted way that only he can. We're gonna miss this guy when he's gone (word is he's got Groat's), so let's enjoy him while he's here.PS The extras are well worth seeing for any Seinfeld fan. There's about 25 minutes of them, four little bits of which the highlight is the interview with Larry and the SeinFour. Most interesting is the end, with Jason sharing everyone's enthusiasm but then hammering it home with a little too much sincerity about how great the five of them are as a unit and the magic is so special yadda yadda (read: we oughta do this again, and soon) and you can see both Larry and Jerry trying not to wince. They know that a real Seinfeld reunion would make mega-millions and they need neither that nor the fakeness of it all, which Alexander evinces here, vaguely unaware he's doing so but seemingly unable to help it. Perhaps he's desperate for that level of stardom again...or perhaps he's channelling the repressed needs of a still sein-obsessed public.It's a moment that takes the meta-self-reference of the final Curb show and adds another layer, albeit a layer all too close to the original thing Larry was mocking in the first place.Which only drives home one of the best themes in Curb: showbiz feeds on and creates phoniness and unreality on so many levels that if you don't laugh at the beast it will swallow you whole.",5,Meta-self-referential moments of genius outweigh the tired bits; nice Seinfeld dvd extras,1279324800,"07 17, 2010",2010,4053,"['4.5', 'ways', 'season', 'slowing', 'down', 'entire', 'concept', 'when', 'Seinfeld', 'reunion', 'hits', 'old', 'Larry', 'jumpstarted', 'are', 'truly', 'classic', 'scenes', 'best', 'best', 'huge', 'fan', 'finest', 'writing', 'Seinfeld', 'mostly', 'courtesy', 'Larry', 'Jerry', 'are', 'scenes', 'alone', 'together', 'especially', 'car', 'when', 'can', 'see', 'Larry', 'come', 'completely', 'alive', 'face', 'glowing', 'real', 'amusement', 'humor', 'very', 'essence', 'why', 'Seinfeld', 'was', 'one', 'ultimate', 'comedy', 'series', 'two', 'comic', 'minds', 'play', 'other', 'guys', 'are', 'true', 'friends', 'two', 'peas', 'pod', 'can', 'see', 'full', 'transparency', 'bits', 'together', 'here', 'car', 'scene', 'feels', 'very', 'happiest', 'perfect', 'karma', 'have', 'friend', 'that.Clearly', 'two', 'are', 'Lennon', 'McCartney', 'comedy.Having', 'said', 'Lar', 'many', 'many', 'bits', 'earlier', 'Curb', 'seasons', 'season', 'seven', 'self-conscious', 'homage/parody', 'sheer', 'ennui', 'hard', 'say', 'Sometimes', 'flat', 'then', 'again', 'improv', 'nature', 'show', 'stale', 'Curb', 'fresh', 'most', 'other', 'comedy', 'show', 'did', 'like', 'single', 'guy', 'here', 'more', 'interaction', 'more', 'people', 'more', 'new', 'jokes', 'When', 'Cheryl', 'back', 'nice', 'Larry', 'just', ""n't"", 'funny', 'around.The', 'early', 'episodes', 'here', 'are', 'good', 'last', 'few', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'have', 'moments', 'even', 'worst', 'Curb', 'twice', 'as', 'funny', 'most', 'other', 'shows', 'there', 'today', 'Black', 'Swan', 'highlight', 'nice', 'episode', 'see', 'Larry', 'being', 'ever', 'more', 'honest', 'tipping', 'habits', 'all-too-logical', 'curmudgeonly', 'ways', 'even', 'pushing', 'envelope', 'rash', 'thing', 'Most', 'episodes', 'still', 'wrap', 'up', 'disparate', 'thread', 'nicely', 'la', 'Seinfeld.And', 'last', 'episode', 'real', 'winner', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'Larry', 'life', 'twin', 'fictional', 'lives', 'LD', 'Seinfeld', 'universe', 'intertwine', 'self-referential', 'Escheresque', 'quality', 'Curb', 'Larry', 'staging', 'Seinfeld', 'reunion', 'get', 'back', 'ex', 'who', 'really', 'did', 'flee', 'Madoff', 'money', 'real', 'life', 'how', 'out', 'everyone', 'acting', 'not', 'LD', 'conception', 'mindgame', 'highest', 'order', 'quite', 'brilliant', 'many', 'ways', 'particularly', 'shot', 'LD', 'Cheryl', 'watching', 'George', 'ex', 'tv', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'marvel', 'how', 'weird', 'must', 'be', 'be', 'Larry', 'David', 'malcontent', 'billionaire', 'comic', 'everyone', 'playing', 'not', 'quite', 'tv.It', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'Curb', 'when', 'good', 'great', 'once', 'again', 'Larry', 'David', 'goods', 'twisted', 'way', 'only', 'can', ""'re"", 'gon', 'miss', 'guy', 'when', 'gone', 'word', 'got', 'Groat', 'so', 'let', 'enjoy', 'extras', 'are', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Seinfeld', 'fan', '25', 'minutes', 'four', 'little', 'bits', 'highlight', 'interview', 'Larry', 'SeinFour', 'Most', 'interesting', 'end', 'Jason', 'sharing', 'everyone', 'enthusiasm', 'then', 'hammering', 'home', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'sincerity', 'how', 'great', 'five', 'are', 'unit', 'magic', 'so', 'special', 'yadda', 'yadda', 'read', 'oughta', 'do', 'again', 'soon', 'can', 'see', 'Larry', 'Jerry', 'trying', 'not', 'wince', 'know', 'real', 'Seinfeld', 'reunion', 'would', 'make', 'mega-millions', 'need', 'fakeness', 'Alexander', 'evinces', 'here', 'vaguely', 'doing', 'so', 'seemingly', 'unable', 'help', 'Perhaps', 'desperate', 'level', 'stardom', 'again', 'perhaps', 'channelling', 'repressed', 'needs', 'still', 'sein-obsessed', 'public.It', 'moment', 'meta-self-reference', 'final', 'Curb', 'show', 'layer', 'layer', 'too', 'close', 'original', 'thing', 'Larry', 'was', 'mocking', 'first', 'place.Which', 'only', 'home', 'one', 'best', 'themes', 'Curb', 'showbiz', 'feeds', 'creates', 'phoniness', 'unreality', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'do', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'beast', 'will', 'swallow', 'whole']",N/A

I'm glad that they decided to keep Leon on the show because he was the funniest member of the Black family. Loretta was too over-bearing and the mother just annoyed me.Since season 3, the CYE seasons have be centered around one major plot point. Season 3's was the restuarant collaboration project, season 4's was The Producers, season 5's was Larry's adoption mystery, season 6's was the Blacks and Larry and Cheryl's separation.

The the first few seasons Larry was under scrutiny for a lot of things that weren't completely his fault and all of the misunderstandings made you pity him.  Ever since his split with Cheryl(who I think played a part in keeping Larry's obnoxious behavior under control) Larry has had nothing else to lose.In season 7, Larry gets rid of his girlfriend Loretta, who has cancer by conjuring up the bizarrest plans. He dates a woman in a wheelchair or a ""wheelie"", strictly for its benefits, he 'splashes' on a portarit of Jesus, and uses the Seinfeld reunion project as a means to indirectly rekindle his relationship with Cheryl.

I enjoyed this season more than the last two (Season 1 was still the best).  When Season 6 concluded many of us thought that was going to be the grand finale of the show.  With Cheryl finally having enough of Larry's antics, pairing up with the underwear salesman who befriended her in her time of great fear (Larry was too busy with the TIVO guy at the time) and Larry settled in with Loretta and the rest of the Blacks.Well Larry got the itch to do a type of Seinfeld reunion show to make up for the disappointing ending of the original series.  He put together the idea that this could be used as a platform to get Cheryl back.  As the series started, we see Larry bored with Loretta and trying to get out of the relationship.  Larry learns that Loretta may have cancer prompting Jeff to let him know that he better break up with her before she tells him because ""you can't break up with someone with cancer.""  It then becomes a race with Larry to get to Loretta before her doctor so he can break up with her before the doctor gives her the devastating news.  (brilliant writing).Usual battles with Susie and Marty Funkhouser crop up during the season.Episodes that followed dealt with Larry dating women in wheelchairs that he has code names for, killing the country club owner's pet swan and a lesson in proper tipping.  To top it off Larry tries to get the Seinfeld cast together only because he meets Cheryl on the way to an audition and he feels that if can give her a part in the show he can slowly win her back.For those of you that have not seen it I do not want to spoil the fun.  I will say that the last two episodes dealt with the actual Seinfeld reunion and the show will definately not disappoint like the original series ending from 1999.

But, you can't turn your head away.  You just have to see what is going to happen next.As anybody who has been following this show knows, Larry David's television persona is that of a ""world class shmuck"".  He always seems to be saying or doing the wrong thing, which gets both himself and others into some very uncomfortable, ""painfully"" funny, situations.The primary plotline for this season is, of course, the SEINFELD show reunion.  Thus, all the key cast members of that iconic series (e.g. Jerry Seinfeld, Jason Alexander, Michael Richards, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss) appear as both themselves (or as how David has written them) and also their Seinfeld characters in multiple episodes of CURB.It's very enjoyable to revisit these popular television characters after ten years, yet the SEINFELD episodes are not the funniest, most outrageous segments of this season.I found myself laughing out loud at the controversial ""Denise Handicapped"" episode, which not only had Larry dating a lady in a wheelchair (actually two of them), but also getting into a wrestling match with Rosie O'Donnell.I also enjoyed ""The Hot Towel,"" an episode that had Larry ""stalking"" his poor doctor (Philip Baker Hall).Then, of course, there is ""The Bare Midriff"" episode, which also caused a considerable controversy because it had Larry accidentally urinating on a picture of Jesus.If there is a weakness to this series, it's that some of the predicaments that Larry finds himself in seem forced, totally unbelievable.  For example, in one sequence, a take-out restaurant owner has him arrested for ""stealing"" a few extra paper napkins.  Seriously, would the police even take a report for such a ""crime""?Thankfully, missteps like this are few and far between.David's real-life friends, Ted Danson and wife Mary Steenburgen, plus Richard Lewis continue to be semi-regulars on the series, and Shelley Berman and Richard Kind are back as David's father and cousin respectively.

1281556,A1B9XODPEB1RWX,B002OOWKSA,M on Amazon,"[10, 15]","I love Larry David. After seeing Curb Your Enthusiasm I realized L.D. coached all of the characters of Seinfeld on how to deliver his jokes, not just Jason Alexander (George Castanza). David has repeatedly mentioned that things on Curb, especially, are not as funny when they are scripted. The jokes will come off like any other sit-com. What has been special about Curb is the element of spontaneity. So much is improvised.In the 7th season everyone is too serious about ranting. All smirks and holding back laughter are missing.......I mean the genuine fun that has been just under the surface for most of the series not the fake struggling to hold back laughter that is done on SNL or the old Carol Burnett Show. It seems that they needed to relax and allow scenes some air. It is one rant after another with a few funny moments in between. I hope there are more seasons to come. This was not one of the best.Ted Danson, Richard Lewis and Jeff Garlin have been very good under Curb's improv conditions. Even when they are supposed to be serious they are funny. Some actors and guests/(L.D. friends) appearing on Curb are not actors but comedians. They do not have a clue as to how to behave naturally or plausibly on camera. Add the element of improv and they are often uptight and struggle just to be active. Sometimes saying and doing nothing would have worked better. Over the course of the series there have been about as many successful as failed performances. Sofia Milos, Ben Stiller and Chris Williams are a few that were very good but there is an equally long list of bombs including Christine Taylor, Anne Bancroft, Michael York, and the various appearances of Seinfeld cast members.Every time the Seinfeld cast have appeared on Curb they have been overly serious, ranting or taking issue with everything Larry David does. This is not funny. Jerry Seinfeld is not an actor. He managed in Seinfeld but in Curb we are supposed to see him as a real person not a character in a T.V. show. He is terrible under Curb's improv conditions. They have attempted to edit dialogue so it flows but it is very unnatural and choppy. Jerry looks like he is half asleep. It isn't funny. Jerry has said that one of the strengths that set Seinfeld apart was that it was always about the humor and never took itself seriously. There was never an episode, A Very Special Seinfeld, where they promoted a cause. The cast had fun. Everyone was light and enjoyed working together. However, Larry David has depicted the cast as a bunch of stuffed shirts who always take exception to his behavior.I don't think talking seriously about humor is ever interesting, let alone funny. It is only interesting when it remains light and is joked about. As soon as someone, especially a comedian, attempts to intellectualize about humor it becomes very dull. Since Seinfeld, Jason Alexander has been trying to show the world he is smart and sharp ...the antithesis of George Castanza. The platform in which to make that case is not a related comedy, (including its bonus material). With that in mind, portraying people we have come to believe to be light and funny as a bunch of serious sticks in the mud was a bad concept from the start. Seeing everyone fake a real moment when the crew is supposed to be laughing at the script review/rehearsal was the antithesis of Larry David's motto, if it is too scripted it isn't funny.",3,LD forgets his own motto scripted doesn't work...,1278806400,"07 11, 2010",2010,3402,"['love', 'Larry', 'David', 'seeing', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'realized', 'L.D', 'coached', 'characters', 'Seinfeld', 'how', 'deliver', 'jokes', 'not', 'just', 'Jason', 'Alexander', 'George', 'Castanza', 'David', 'repeatedly', 'mentioned', 'things', 'Curb', 'especially', 'are', 'not', 'funny', 'when', 'are', 'scripted', 'jokes', 'will', 'come', 'off', 'other', 'sit-com', 'What', 'been', 'special', 'Curb', 'element', 'spontaneity', 'So', 'much', 'improvised.In', '7th', 'season', 'everyone', 'too', 'serious', 'ranting', 'smirks', 'holding', 'back', 'laughter', 'are', 'missing', '.I', 'mean', 'genuine', 'fun', 'been', 'just', 'surface', 'most', 'series', 'not', 'fake', 'struggling', 'hold', 'back', 'laughter', 'done', 'SNL', 'old', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'Show', 'needed', 'relax', 'allow', 'scenes', 'air', 'one', 'rant', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'hope', 'are', 'more', 'seasons', 'come', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'best.Ted', 'Danson', 'Richard', 'Lewis', 'Jeff', 'Garlin', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'good', 'Curb', 'improv', 'conditions', 'Even', 'when', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'serious', 'are', 'funny', 'actors', 'guests/', 'L.D', 'friends', 'appearing', 'Curb', 'are', 'not', 'actors', 'comedians', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'clue', 'how', 'behave', 'naturally', 'plausibly', 'camera', 'Add', 'element', 'improv', 'are', 'often', 'uptight', 'struggle', 'just', 'be', 'active', 'Sometimes', 'saying', 'doing', 'nothing', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'course', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'many', 'successful', 'failed', 'performances', 'Sofia', 'Milos', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Chris', 'Williams', 'are', 'few', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'equally', 'long', 'list', 'bombs', 'including', 'Christine', 'Taylor', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'Michael', 'York', 'various', 'appearances', 'Seinfeld', 'cast', 'members.Every', 'time', 'Seinfeld', 'cast', 'have', 'appeared', 'Curb', 'have', 'been', 'overly', 'serious', 'ranting', 'taking', 'issue', 'everything', 'Larry', 'David', 'not', 'funny', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'not', 'actor', 'managed', 'Seinfeld', 'Curb', 'are', 'supposed', 'see', 'real', 'person', 'not', 'character', 'T.V', 'show', 'terrible', 'Curb', 'improv', 'conditions', 'have', 'attempted', 'edit', 'dialogue', 'very', 'unnatural', 'choppy', 'Jerry', 'half', 'asleep', ""n't"", 'funny', 'Jerry', 'said', 'one', 'strengths', 'set', 'Seinfeld', 'apart', 'was', 'was', 'always', 'humor', 'never', 'took', 'seriously', 'was', 'never', 'episode', 'Very', 'Special', 'Seinfeld', 'where', 'promoted', 'cause', 'cast', 'had', 'fun', 'Everyone', 'was', 'light', 'enjoyed', 'working', 'together', 'However', 'Larry', 'David', 'depicted', 'cast', 'bunch', 'stuffed', 'shirts', 'who', 'always', 'take', 'exception', 'behavior.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'talking', 'seriously', 'humor', 'ever', 'interesting', 'let', 'alone', 'funny', 'only', 'interesting', 'when', 'light', 'joked', 'about', 'As', 'soon', 'someone', 'especially', 'comedian', 'attempts', 'intellectualize', 'humor', 'very', 'dull', 'Seinfeld', 'Jason', 'Alexander', 'been', 'trying', 'show', 'world', 'smart', 'sharp', 'antithesis', 'George', 'Castanza', 'platform', 'make', 'case', 'not', 'related', 'comedy', 'including', 'bonus', 'material', 'mind', 'portraying', 'people', 'have', 'come', 'believe', 'be', 'light', 'funny', 'bunch', 'serious', 'sticks', 'mud', 'was', 'bad', 'concept', 'start', 'Seeing', 'everyone', 'fake', 'real', 'moment', 'when', 'crew', 'supposed', 'be', 'laughing', 'script', 'review/rehearsal', 'was', 'antithesis', 'Larry', 'David', 'motto', 'too', 'scripted', ""n't"", 'funny']",N/A
