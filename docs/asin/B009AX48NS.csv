1594370,A2V2LYKRYYS99D,B009AX48NS,D. L. Norwood,"[39, 42]","Ms. Miller is pleasant & instructive.  This is an excellent video in that It truly is fast enough & safe enough to keep your heart pumping while burning off the pounds.  The warm up introduces all of the steps that are going to be implemented in the upcoming cardio aerobic segments.  There are four cardio aerobic segments lasting a total of 22 minutes so you can stop & rest if need be. There are 4 people demonstrating different levels simultaneously & you are encouraged to go at your own pace.  Then there is a 24 minute strength training segment followed by stretches.  Weights are needed for the strength training; however, Ms. Miller states that you do not have to use the weights.  Strength training & stretches are done either from a seated position or standing next to the chair.  I especially like the weight training & stretches as I feel that they are safe, effective, & they feel good & more importantly because I can do them.  I do not use the weights because of a health condition.  I am 55 years old & I have been exercising for awhile.  If you are looking for a video that is very slow, I would recommend the Older & Wiser Workout for Seniors for aerobic segments only especially if you have been inactive & have knee or back problems.  If you have good endurance & like a slightly faster pace, then this is the video for you.  Even though I am not athletic I can fully participate in this DVD & enjoy it as well. I own both videos mentioned & enjoy them both.  I am just so glad to find exercise videos suitable for seniors.",5,Absolute Beginners - Cardio & Strength Training Workout for Seniors,1388966400,"01 6, 2014",2014,1544,"['Ms.', 'Miller', 'pleasant', 'instructive', 'excellent', 'video', 'truly', 'fast', 'enough', 'safe', 'enough', 'keep', 'heart', 'pumping', 'burning', 'off', 'pounds', 'warm', 'up', 'introduces', 'steps', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'implemented', 'upcoming', 'cardio', 'aerobic', 'segments', 'are', 'four', 'cardio', 'aerobic', 'segments', 'lasting', 'total', '22', 'minutes', 'can', 'stop', 'rest', 'be', 'are', '4', 'people', 'demonstrating', 'different', 'levels', 'simultaneously', 'are', 'encouraged', 'go', 'own', 'pace', 'Then', '24', 'minute', 'strength', 'training', 'segment', 'followed', 'stretches', 'Weights', 'are', 'needed', 'strength', 'training', 'however', 'Ms.', 'Miller', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'use', 'weights', 'Strength', 'training', 'stretches', 'are', 'done', 'either', 'seated', 'position', 'standing', 'next', 'chair', 'especially', 'weight', 'training', 'stretches', 'feel', 'are', 'safe', 'effective', 'feel', 'good', 'more', 'importantly', 'can', 'do', 'do', 'not', 'use', 'weights', 'health', 'condition', 'am', '55', 'years', 'old', 'have', 'been', 'exercising', 'awhile', 'are', 'looking', 'video', 'very', 'slow', 'would', 'recommend', 'Older', 'Wiser', 'Workout', 'Seniors', 'aerobic', 'segments', 'only', 'especially', 'have', 'been', 'inactive', 'have', 'knee', 'back', 'problems', 'have', 'good', 'endurance', 'slightly', 'faster', 'pace', 'then', 'video', 'Even', 'am', 'not', 'athletic', 'can', 'fully', 'participate', 'DVD', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well', 'own', 'videos', 'mentioned', 'enjoy', 'am', 'just', 'so', 'glad', 'find', 'exercise', 'videos', 'suitable', 'seniors']",Absolute Beginners - Cardio & Strength Training Workout for Seniors
