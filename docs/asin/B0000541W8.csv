I had a lot of fun watching the story grown in the beginning.  The effects near the end and the bedroom scene, were a little dated, but other than that a fun watch.If you are looking for an action film with a religious theme then this is a good one.  Not as inspiring as some, but a nice story and as believable as you want to let it be.  The overall plot is a little far fetched if you are talking strictly biblical, but as a movie it is good.Best advice... have fun and get ready for a good movie with likeable characters!",4,The movie was quite fun!,1355097600,"12 10, 2012",2012,581,"['movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'religious', 'based', 'action', 'film', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'watching', 'story', 'grown', 'beginning', 'effects', 'end', 'bedroom', 'scene', 'were', 'little', 'dated', 'other', 'fun', 'watch.If', 'are', 'looking', 'action', 'film', 'religious', 'theme', 'then', 'good', 'one', 'Not', 'as', 'inspiring', 'nice', 'story', 'as', 'believable', 'want', 'let', 'be', 'overall', 'plot', 'little', 'far', 'fetched', 'are', 'talking', 'strictly', 'biblical', 'movie', 'good.Best', 'advice', 'have', 'fun', 'get', 'ready', 'good', 'movie', 'likeable', 'characters']",Bless the Child

566448,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B0000541W8,Bobby Underwood,"[2, 2]","Perhaps because this low-key thriller had a message of faith in the Good vs. Evil battle in our time it did not fare as well at the box office as darker films of this ilk, but is in fact, both exciting and involving. Kim Basinger gives a fine performance in director Chuck Russell's underrated film.Christmas is a week away and the appearance of a star which has not been observed since the birth of Christ coincides with a series of ritual child murders. Maggie O'Conner (Kim Bassinger) is a nurse living alone after being deserted by a husband who split following two miscarriages. Her sister Jenna (Angela Bettis), a drug addict, shows up on her doorstep only long enough to leave her newborn baby, Cody. Maggie raises her as her own, becoming mother to the somewhat withdrawn little red-haired girl. Maggie senses something is different about Cody, not accepting the diagnoses of autism given her by doctors, and is right. Cody has gentle powers and has been born to lead people back to God.John Travis (Jimmy Smits) is the Federal Agent whose time as a seminary student comes in handy leading the investigation into the six year old children being killed because they were born on December 16th, an occult symbol carved into their arms which points to Black Easter. Rufus Sewell of Dark City and television's 11th Hour is Erik Stark, a charismatic guru who knows what Cody is, and must turn her or destroy her. Holliston Coleman is excellent as the very sweet Cody, whose powers, such as lighting all the candles in church through thought and healing injured animals through her touch is witnessed by Sister Rosa (Lumi Cavazos). When Cody is kidnapped by Stark, Maggie and Agent Travis are helped by angels directing them to her.Christina Ricci gives a fine performance as Sherry Post, who is being sought out by Stark's followers as well. She tries to help Maggie find Cody before it is to late, highlighted by a tense chase in a subway with a shocking ending. As Maggie gets her back and then loses her again amidst images of winged darkness and Stark's minions, Sister Rosa and Reverend Grissom (Ian Holm), a scholar censured by the Vatican, aid her in her desperate search to save her daughter's life and soul.This is all handled in a low key and effective manner of ordinary people thrown into extraordinary circumstances, which adds to the suspense. There is an underlying message about faith in God scattered throughout this teriffic film perhaps different than what many came to it expecting to see. The old-fashioned notion that good will always, in the end, will out and conquer evil leaves viewers of that mindset heartened by its message. Those looking for a film in this genre with a more hopeful ending and substantive message may find this as good as I did when I first saw it in a theatre. An excellent suspense film with supernatural overtones, and an ending for those who still believe there is hope.",5,A Refreshing Slant,1253404800,"09 20, 2009",2009,2923,"['Perhaps', 'low-key', 'thriller', 'had', 'message', 'faith', 'Good', 'vs', 'Evil', 'battle', 'time', 'did', 'not', 'fare', 'as', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'darker', 'films', 'ilk', 'fact', 'exciting', 'involving', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'fine', 'performance', 'director', 'Chuck', 'Russell', 'underrated', 'film.Christmas', 'week', 'away', 'appearance', 'star', 'not', 'been', 'observed', 'birth', 'Christ', 'coincides', 'series', 'ritual', 'child', 'murders', 'Maggie', ""O'Conner"", 'Kim', 'Bassinger', 'nurse', 'living', 'alone', 'being', 'deserted', 'husband', 'who', 'split', 'following', 'two', 'miscarriages', 'sister', 'Jenna', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'drug', 'addict', 'up', 'doorstep', 'only', 'long', 'enough', 'leave', 'newborn', 'baby', 'Cody', 'Maggie', 'own', 'becoming', 'mother', 'somewhat', 'withdrawn', 'little', 'red-haired', 'girl', 'Maggie', 'something', 'different', 'Cody', 'not', 'accepting', 'diagnoses', 'autism', 'given', 'doctors', 'right', 'Cody', 'gentle', 'powers', 'been', 'born', 'lead', 'people', 'back', 'God.John', 'Travis', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'Federal', 'Agent', 'time', 'seminary', 'student', 'handy', 'leading', 'investigation', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'children', 'being', 'killed', 'were', 'born', 'December', '16th', 'occult', 'symbol', 'carved', 'arms', 'points', 'Black', 'Easter', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'Dark', 'City', 'television', '11th', 'Hour', 'Erik', 'Stark', 'charismatic', 'guru', 'who', 'what', 'Cody', 'must', 'turn', 'destroy', 'Holliston', 'Coleman', 'excellent', 'very', 'sweet', 'Cody', 'powers', 'such', 'lighting', 'candles', 'church', 'thought', 'healing', 'injured', 'animals', 'touch', 'witnessed', 'Sister', 'Rosa', 'Lumi', 'Cavazos', 'When', 'Cody', 'kidnapped', 'Stark', 'Maggie', 'Agent', 'Travis', 'are', 'helped', 'angels', 'directing', 'her.Christina', 'Ricci', 'fine', 'performance', 'Sherry', 'Post', 'who', 'being', 'sought', 'out', 'Stark', 'followers', 'well', 'help', 'Maggie', 'find', 'Cody', 'late', 'highlighted', 'tense', 'chase', 'subway', 'shocking', 'ending', 'Maggie', 'back', 'then', 'again', 'amidst', 'images', 'winged', 'darkness', 'Stark', 'minions', 'Sister', 'Rosa', 'Reverend', 'Grissom', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'scholar', 'censured', 'Vatican', 'aid', 'desperate', 'search', 'save', 'daughter', 'life', 'soul.This', 'handled', 'low', 'key', 'effective', 'manner', 'ordinary', 'people', 'thrown', 'extraordinary', 'circumstances', 'suspense', 'underlying', 'message', 'faith', 'God', 'scattered', 'teriffic', 'film', 'perhaps', 'different', 'what', 'many', 'came', 'expecting', 'see', 'old-fashioned', 'notion', 'good', 'will', 'always', 'end', 'will', 'out', 'conquer', 'evil', 'viewers', 'mindset', 'heartened', 'message', 'looking', 'film', 'genre', 'more', 'hopeful', 'ending', 'substantive', 'message', 'may', 'find', 'as', 'good', 'did', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'theatre', 'excellent', 'suspense', 'film', 'supernatural', 'overtones', 'ending', 'who', 'still', 'believe', 'hope']",Bless the Child

It's Fun, and not meant to be taken seriously. It is a Rarity in the ""Devil Movie"" sub-genre as it's Ultimately Uplifting, the role reversals from ""The Omen"" work well and there are two or three moments where I was spooked right out of my seat.On the Performance side, the Bad takes over the Good. I found Kim Basingers Performance to be a Mixed Bag. She is a little too Emotional, but also pretty Believable. Christina Ricci is virtually a Glorified Extra with about 20 minutes screen time. Jimmy Smits looks Bored, Confused, Tired, Scared, Bitter and Lifeless. If this is the best he can do Post-NYPD Blue, than his Career will Assuredly follow David Caruso's.Rufus Sewell makes up for all his Co-stars Misgivings. His Devilish Role is a Scene Stealers Dream, and he never misses a chance to show up his co-stars. Much like Gabriel Burne in ""End of Days"", Rufus has the Best Lines, the Best Scenes, the Most Talent, the Most Professionalism and he too walks off with the film.In the end, the Good points just outweigh the Bad points.

566453,AQG5YCXO6FY6K,B0000541W8,but_seriously_folks,"[2, 2]","One of my favorite movies of all-time is ""The Omen"". That is my yard stick for horror movies in general and supernatural thrillers in particular. This movie holds-up well in the comparison. ""Bless the Child"" does not have any truly nail-biting moments like the scene from ""The Omen"" in the Italian graveyard but it does come close with the scene in the beginning showing a child being abducted, Christina Ricci in the subway, and the final scene.I also had a great affinity for some of the biblical and apochryphal stories that were woven into this movie: the scene with the bird is similar to a story in one of the Gnostic Gospels, the retelling of the ""Slaughter of the Innocents"", and the temptation at the top of the building.One thing that needs addressed is the relationship to the book, which is tenuous at best. The movie is an extremely stripped-down retelling. The novel weaves many different religious systems and mythologies together and contains significantly more material than that shown in the movie. Heck, other than the names of the characters, I think this is probably the furthest I've seen a movie stray from its source novel....OK, maybe throw in Baldacci's ""Absolute Power"" in there, too.Aside from the comparison to the novel, this movie as a stand-alone project was one of the better supernatural/religious thrillers I've seen. The story wasn't overshadowed by special effects nor was it bogged down by an array of sub-plots and other extraneous material as I've experienced in other similar movies.I thought the actor playing Eric Stark was perfect for the part. Just enough arrogance interlaced with charm to nail that character perfectly. The girl playing Cody, the central character, was tremendous, especially considering she was only six or seven years old...so, I have to give a lot of credit to the director for that performance, too.The other enjoyable performance was Jimmy Smits. His character was an FBI agent who had spent some time in Seminary. He walked a fine line of having his character stay true to his religious beliefs, especially in a very secular workplace, without coming off a 'preachy' or 'moralistic'. That was a refreshing change from other movies in this genre.All in all, ""Bless the Child"" is one of the better movies I've seen in this genre...not a full-blown horror movie but a highly entertaining, fun way to spend 90 minutes or so.

566460,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B0000541W8,D. Litton,"[1, 2]","Since it was one of the most anticipated events of the century, it only seemed fit that there be a large number of movies that dealt with a premise of possible apocalyptic events that mean the end of the Godly world and signal the coming of darker forces. We were given &quot;End of Days&quot; at the tail end of 1999, which was a good try, but missed out by slipping into typical action thriller gimmicks. &quot;Lost Souls&quot; also gave us a formula for the world's end, with a man who is destined to become the antichrist and the woman who will stop at nothing to save him. &quot;Bless the Child&quot; falls into the category of apocalyptic thrillers, and for all intensive purposes, it does seem to work quite well in the genre.What keeps me from truly liking this movie as much as I wanted to is the fact that it deals with so many different elements and plot twists, but they never really fit together when the ending comes. It deals with one woman's struggle to find and rescue a small child, all the while battling evil visions that haunt her and the ongoing battle of her faith in God. It's also a story of the accult, which believes in Satan and all his evils, and their wish to bring on specially-powered child into their powerful group to strengthen their actions. But, no matter how hard they try or how much you try to make it work, the two never really fit together, and the end of the film seems to leave more loose ends untied.When hospital nurse Maggie O'Conner comes home one night and finds her addict sister Jenna on her doorstep, holding a newborn baby and the hope that they can become sisters again. No sooner does she con Maggie into allowing her to stay does she leave, leaving baby Cody in the care of her aunt, who lovingly raises her and brings her up in a healthy home. From the very beginning, Cody is different from other children, and while most doctors think it is a form of autism, Maggie believes otherwise. Cody has the power to make things happen: a bird is willed back to life in her hands, unlit candles spring to life around her, and she feels a strongly emotional connection to the Virgin Mary, whom she says &quot;is crying for us.&quot;Meanwhile, there are darker forces at work, looking for one child that has been named as the one that will strengthen the connection between humans and Satan, and when they come across Cody, they know they have found the one. Jenna hops back into the picture, strangely enough with a new boyfriend who leads a spiritual group for drug addicts, and they both demand that Cody come to live with them. They later resort to kidnapping, and it is clear that something more sinister is in store. Maggie goes to the police, but when she is attacked in the subway one night, no one believes her story that she was attacked by members of the cult. Escaping the hospital, she goes on the run in an attempt to retrieve Cody from those who would do her harm, sometimes with thrilling results.The rundown of the plot is this: the beginning starts out well, leading into a satisfying middle chunk and soon spiralling into an ending that leaves us a bit confused as to what message its really trying to get across to us. When working separately, the elements at hand all work very well, giving us different perspectives about opposing opinions in the field of religion and faith. When you try to put together some of these different elements, you will find that it makes the movie muddled, taking away from what has true potential but never lives up to it. All throughout the movie, I kept waiting for some terrific explosion of everything the movie had been saying up until the ending, wanting to know just what it was trying to tell me. We already knew that the little girl was special, and had the power to heal like no other person alive. We were given the facts as to Maggie's beliefs and disbeliefs about religion, and it was plainly obvious that she had changed them during the middle sequences.So what is the movie really trying to say in the end? There is something lying underneath all of the plot and storyline that is just screaming to be let out. There has to be. A movie like this does not go so far into the catacombs of religious beliefs and the battle between good and evil, and not have something to show for it in the end. I guess it all just depends on how you look at all the elements of the movie before that makes a difference in how it will affect you after it's over.There are some good forces at work in this movie, moreso than some of the critics thought after its release in theaters. The many questions that it raises about a person's faith are remarkably affecting. Most intrical to the plot is the symbolism of Jesus being tempted by Satan, when Cody is being tempted by the satanic leader to do things and have faith that God will save her, or deliver her from possible harm. The way in which she keeps her calm, never letting go of her faith in God, will give you chills more than anything else. Also, I truly liked the way in which her powers are displayed, not through grandiose special effects wizardry, but through heartfelt scenes of simple hugs and kind words, like those of Jesus in his teaching and miracles long ago.The intentions of the cult side of the story seem a bit murky, though. When Sheri, who has escaped the group and knows the whereabouts of Cody, is revealing the group's plans for Cody, she tells of their plan to bring Cody over to their side, or have her killed. I was left with a lot of questions as to what might possibly happen if she were to be brought to their side: would she lose her magical, God-given abilities, or would they segue over into her devilish beliefs if she chose to convert? Also, why was it so important that the cult have her, anyway? Sheri speaks of the group's ability to do horrible things to other people without physical interaction, and that is later demostrated in Cody's test of good and evil. So why would they need her powers anyway?Despite its flaws, &quot;Bless the Child&quot; does deliver a good story, due majorly in part to the acting talents involved. Kim Basinger is the lead as Maggie, and she gives us a powerhouse performance that keeps us involved in the movie. We really do believe that with all that's going on, ..., she does love that little girl. Jimmy Smits plays the detective assigned to the case, and with all of his past involvement with &quot;NYPD Blue,&quot; he breathes real life into his character, who knows what he is talking about and how to deal with his job's frustrations. Rufus Sewell is a chilling cult leader, and you may find yourself frightened by his approach to his beliefs, and how he acts upon them. Holliston Coleman plays Cody, and she gives us a sweet and effective performance that resembles the gentility of Jesus in his day.Though it can be slightly confusing, &quot;Bless the Child&quot; is not that bad. It does keep you entertained while also giving you a unique look at different aspects of religious and non-religious beliefs. The acting will keep you involved with the plot, so just sit back and enjoy the ride. It can be thrilling at times.",3,Never realizes its full potential.,983232000,"02 27, 2001",2001,7151,"['was', 'one', 'most', 'anticipated', 'events', 'century', 'only', 'seemed', 'fit', 'be',

566461,A1EZMV5DSWU8TU,B0000541W8,Draconis Blackthorne,"[1, 2]","A little girl named ""Cody"" supposedly representing the ""light side"" is born, whom which is heralded by a bright star shining in the heavens like the nazarene fable. A cult-leader takes on the role of Herod in attempting to capture this special child, labelled herein as ""The Slaughter of Innocence"", in the process, murdering children born in the same week, much like that presented in Omen 3, which displayed the same dynamic. At first, she is misdiagnosed with autism, for being so introverted, but steadily begins demonstrating supernatural abilities, particularly in the telekinetic vein, which catches the attention of one of the cult leader's lackeys; the cult-leader charms his way into the life of the single, drug-addicted, thieving & emaciated mother named 'Jenna', who dumped the child with her older sister Maggie O'Connor {played by Kim Basinger}, who takes the child as her own, until the lowlife 'mother' returns with the Cult-leader to kidnap the child, in order to brainwash her towards the 'Dark Side', or to sacrifice her if she does not turn to darkness. The cult is more reminiscent of Scientology in its aesthetics & iconography, rather than some satanistic cult, although the adolescent thugs match the gothic/devil-worshipper criteria. Which in one notable scene, beat the hell out of Christina Ricci's character {a little goth-(...)}, eventually decapitating her in a subway, through the behest of demonic enitites circumnavigating the area as she is beaten into a bloody pulp. . A nice effect.The demonic manifestations witnessed by Basinger's character at various spots are remarkable, given marvellous life. The whole story, after she is chased down by the cult to retrieve the girl whose attempted re-kidnapping in a poignant scene lands her in her car travelling in the opposite direction on a bridge highway, at which she crashes into the edge, the car teetering on the verge of plunging into the rushing river, but she is rescued by a burley angel who dematerializes - that is one thing that is noticed now & again, these ""angels"" appearing here & there to help her & the girl along in various places, rescuing them out of some tough spots, where they would have otherwise surely perished. As the angels appear, so do the demons manifest themselves in the various ""humans"" surrounding the cult-leader, whose henchmen speed around in a black limousine {reminiscient of Mike Warnke's fictional ""The Satan Seller""}.Jimi Smits plays an occult investigator {a-la Randy Emon}, who is pictured briefly leafing through The Devil's Notebook among his collection of occult books, although the camera does not once close-up on it, but instead shows the back from a distance - but does display a ""photo"" {looks photoshopped} on one fabricated collage of Dr. LaVey in horned cowl.The materialization of Satan in a converted church {surrounded with flying, graceful serpantine black demons} is splendid {recollections of The Devil's Rain comes to mind}, transmogrifying from a legion of rats {likened in the Francis Ford Coppola version of Dracula} onto an infernal throne behind the altar, upon which the little girl awaits to be sacrificed, or to rule the world, depending upon her decision. She is prepared in a bridal gown, brought forth by two black robed cultists. Well, she decides for the blindlight, & is ""delivered"", as it were, by etherial angels who distract the cult-leader, who is then shot by Smits.The movie does play in the typical binary scenario of good vs. evil, so of course there is the demoralization, but The Devil is not confronted directly, but only makes a brief cameo appearance as described above.The villain {played by Rufus Sewell} & his organization described in this movie are in the newage description, complete with an insignia which resembles the pyramidical O.T.O.'s, with the caption ""You Are Your Own God"" {so at least there is a minimal portrayal of Satanic philosophy}; although the ideology presented herein is more akin to a bug-eyed satanified Jim Jones.Included in this DVD are interviews with director Chuck Russell, as well as with the actors, & allows to jump to various scenes throughout the film.

This script is abominable.  The story is utterly unimaginative in its premise and the dialogue is incredibly bad.  The behavior of the characters, especially Maggie (Kim Basinger) is often incongruous and sometimes ludicrous.The story is about a modern second coming of Christ, with the little Christ girl being born to a drug addict (Angela Bettis) and left with her Aunt Maggie.  The child is being sought out by the disciples of Satan with the intention of converting her to the dark side or killing her.  The army of inept devil worshipers keeps kidnapping her and our mousy heroine single handedly keeps outwitting them and stealing her back followed by interminable car chases pursued by a stretch limo.  Meanwhile, a group of nuns gets together and prays aloud that God will protect Maggie and the child in one of the film's most laughable scenes.  All this culminates in a showdown between God and Satan including some lame visual effects.A number of reputable actors are wasted on this hack script.  Jimmy Smits is a good actor who gives his standard solid cop portrayal.  Kim Basinger can be excellent in the right role.  She is good in sexy roles, certain dramatic roles and has even proven to be an effective comedian at times.  However, an action heroine she is not and will never be.  The most convincing performance is given by Angela Bettis as Jenna, who looked genuinely strung out on heroine.Supernatural thrillers provide unlimited possibilities for creativity and imagination.  This pedestrian script is a trite treatment of a familiar story that is poorly written and directed.  I rated it a 3/10.

Yet, most of the stuff that is being put out is certainly entertaining. And although a large majority of people do not have this movie on their list of entertaining ones, I do. Bless the Child, I think, contains a well thought out story of a young girl who was sent from God. A Satanist who has been searching for her will stop at nothing to make sure he turns her over to the devil.The good stuff: Some of the acting. The little girl who plays Cody, Holliston Coleman, was actually very good. Her character never once annoyed or bothered me. She can deliver some strong lines. &quot;After you.&quot; Yeah, I know, it may sound corny to some people, but while watching the movie and what happened before she said it, kind of chilled me. Christina Ricci did well here. Her character was used to get Kim Basinger's character closer to finding Cody, but wasn't used enough. I really wish they would have broadened her character. It was also nice to see Jimmy Smits put back on the &quot;cop / detective&quot; routine. Although this is labeled as a psychological thriller or what have you, there are jump scenes and gore. The jump scenes were pretty much non-effective in some parts, but in anothers, it worked well. I didn't even expect the gore. Yes, there are decapitated heads and knitting needles through eyes here. It surprised me.The bad / fair stuff: Um, Kim Basinger really didn't do well here. In her other movies she's been in, she is awesome, but here? She rarely gave a convincing performance. The ending is pretty much where she shines. Rufus Sewell, who was Eric Stark - the villain-  did okay as the Satanist Eric Stark. But he wasn't that much of an intimidation with his actions. Although his performance really never dulled.  I felt as if the beginning of Bless the Child was a bit rushed, but after that, the movie settles into the basic plot, and rides from there. It's not a quick ride. I do admit, sometimes it dragged, but it never lost my interest.The DVD's video and audio transfers are pretty good. The colors are done very good. The only supplements on the disc are an audio commentary (Which I have yet to catch), theatrical trailer, and interviews. Would have been nice to at least seen a featurette of some sort.In the end, Bless the Child isn't top Hollywood material, but it's interesting none-the-least.",3,"The Good, The Bad",997920000,"08 16, 2001",2001,2425,"['Come', 'people', 'cinema', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'days', 'Very', 'rarely', 'do', 'get', 'gems', 'days', 'most', 'stuff', 'being', 'put', 'out', 'certainly', 'entertaining', 'large', 'majority', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'movie', 'list', 'entertaining', 'ones', 'do', 'Bless', 'Child', 'think', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'sent', 'God', 'A', 'Satanist', 'who', 'been', 'searching', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'make', 'sure', 'devil.The', 'good', 'stuff', 'acting', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'Cody', 'Holliston', 'Coleman', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'character', 'never', 'once', 'annoyed', 'bothered', 'can', 'deliver', 'strong', 'lines', 'quot', 'you.', 'quot', 'Yeah', 'know', 'may', 'sound', 'corny', 'people', 'watching', 'movie', 'what', 'happened', 'said', 'kind', 'chilled', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'did', 'well', 'here', 'character', 'was', 'used', 'get', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'character', 'closer', 'finding', 'Cody', 'was', ""n't"", 'used', 'enough', 'really', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'broadened', 'character', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'put', 'back', 'quot', '/', 'detective', 'quot', 'routine', 'labeled', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'what', 'have', 'are', 'jump', 'scenes', 'gore', 'jump', 'scenes', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'non-effective', 'parts', 'anothers', 'worked', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'expect', 'gore', 'Yes', 'are', 'decapitated', 'heads', 'knitting', 'needles', 'eyes', 'here', 'surprised', 'me.The', 'bad', '/', 'fair', 'stuff', 'Um', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'here', 'other', 'movies', 'been', 'awesome', 'here', 'rarely', 'gave', 'convincing', 'performance', 'ending', 'pretty', 'much', 'where', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'who', 'was', 'Eric', 'Stark', 'villain-', 'did', 'okay', 'Satanist', 'Eric', 'Stark', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'intimidation', 'actions', 'performance', 'really', 'never', 'dulled', 'felt', 'beginning', 'Bless', 'Child', 'was', 'bit', 'rushed', 'movie', 'basic', 'plot', 'rides', 'there', 'not', 'quick', 'ride', 'do', 'admit', 'dragged', 'never', 'lost', 'interest.The', 'DVD', 'video', 'audio', 'transfers', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'colors', 'are', 'done', 'very', 'good', 'only', 'supplements', 'disc', 'are', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Which', 'have', 'yet', 'catch', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'interviews', 'Would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'least', 'seen', 'featurette', 'sort.In', 'end', 'Bless', 'Child', ""n't"", 'top', 'Hollywood', 'material', 'interesting', 'none-the-least']",Bless the Child

566473,A152C8GYY25HAH,B0000541W8,Matthew Horner,"[1, 3]","Kim Bassinger did an interview in which she said the took the lead role in Bless the Child because it told a good story. Like many of the works of Stephen King, Bless the Child shows that some stories that read well don't necessarily film well.Around Christmas Eve, Maggie O'Connor [Bassinger] gets a surprise visit from her drug addicted younger sister, Jenna [Angela Bettis], who brings with her a daughter who's only a few days old. Within minutes Jenna has fled, leaving baby Cody in Maggie's care. A few years later Jenna still hasn't surfaced, and Maggie is raising the child alone. Cody has been diagnosed with autism, but Maggie, who is herself a nurse, doesn't necessarily agree with the doctors. While Cody is withdrawn, she is responsive and loving. Jenna reappears one day with her new husband, Eric [Rufus Sewell]. They demand that Cody be turned over to them at once. Eric heads a vast and mysterious New Age cult, and Jenna claims to be drug free. Maggie refuses to give up custody. You guessed it. Eric is literally in league with the devil, and what follows is a fight for Cody's soul. It seems the child has been chosen as the prize in yet another earthly battle between God and Satan.The movie is one of dozens that have been spawned over the years as the result of the successes of The Exorcist and The Omen. The themes of Bless the Child are not as dark, in that the ideas of free will and the power of good are emphasized. It is the tired old tools of the horror genre that bring it down. Once again, the Catholic church is used as the only religious power on earth that can recognize evil forces and that has the tools to battle them. Yet, as always, the people the church employs to fight evil come across as lunatics and fruitcakes. No wonder we are doomed to defeat. Who could be expected to trust, much less believe in, these crazies? Why does cinema Satan always use the same old tricks? Can't anyone think of some new ones?Kim Bassinger gives a decent performance as Maggie. Eight-year old Holliston Coleman is acceptably creepy as Cody, although she doesn't have much to do other than appearing to be in trance all the time. Both actress are upstaged by Angela Bettis and Rufus Sewell who remind us that playing the bad guys can be the best roles there are, especially in mediocre movies.",2,Clone of a clone of an 'Exorcist' clone,1016323200,"03 17, 2002",2002,2318,"['Kim', 'Bassinger', 'did', 'interview', 'said', 'took', 'lead', 'role', 'Bless', 'Child', 'told', 'good', 'story', 'many', 'works', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Bless', 'Child', 'stories', 'read', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'film', 'well.Around', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'Maggie', ""O'Connor"", '[', 'Bassinger', ']', 'surprise', 'visit', 'drug', 'addicted', 'younger', 'sister', 'Jenna', '[', 'Angela', 'Bettis', ']', 'who', 'daughter', 'who', 'only', 'few', 'days', 'old', 'minutes', 'Jenna', 'fled', 'leaving', 'baby', 'Cody', 'Maggie', 'care', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'Jenna', 'still', ""n't"", 'surfaced', 'Maggie', 'raising', 'child', 'alone', 'Cody', 'been', 'diagnosed', 'autism', 'Maggie', 'who', 'nurse', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'agree', 'doctors', 'Cody', 'withdrawn', 'responsive', 'loving', 'Jenna', 'one', 'day', 'new', 'husband', 'Eric', '[', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', ']', 'demand', 'Cody', 'be', 'turned', 'once', 'Eric', 'vast', 'mysterious', 'New', 'Age', 'cult', 'Jenna', 'be', 'drug', 'free', 'Maggie', 'give', 'up', 'custody', 'guessed', 'Eric', 'literally', 'league', 'devil', 'what', 'fight', 'Cody', 'soul', 'child', 'been', 'chosen', 'prize', 'yet', 'earthly', 'battle', 'God', 'Satan.The', 'movie', 'one', 'dozens', 'have', 'been', 'spawned', 'years', 'result', 'successes', 'Exorcist', 'Omen', 'themes', 'Bless', 'Child', 'are', 'not', 'dark', 'ideas', 'free', 'will', 'power', 'good', 'are', 'emphasized', 'tired', 'old', 'tools', 'horror', 'genre', 'bring', 'down', 'Once', 'again', 'Catholic', 'church', 'used', 'only', 'religious', 'power', 'earth', 'can', 'recognize', 'evil', 'forces', 'tools', 'battle', 'Yet', 'always', 'people', 'church', 'fight', 'evil', 'come', 'lunatics', 'fruitcakes', 'wonder', 'are', 'doomed', 'defeat', 'Who', 'could', 'be', 'expected', 'trust', 'much', 'less', 'believe', 'crazies', 'Why', 'cinema', 'Satan', 'always', 'use', 'same', 'old', 'tricks', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'think', 'new', 'ones', 'Kim', 'Bassinger', 'decent', 'performance', 'Maggie', 'Eight-year', 'old', 'Holliston', 'Coleman', 'acceptably', 'creepy', 'Cody', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'other', 'appearing', 'be', 'trance', 'time', 'actress', 'are', 'upstaged', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'who', 'remind', 'playing', 'bad', 'guys', 'can', 'be', 'best', 'roles', 'are', 'especially', 'mediocre', 'movies']",Bless the Child
566474,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B0000541W8,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[12, 12]","I love movies with religious tones to them, despite not being any which way religious myself. Stigmata and End Of Days, and now this, are excellent examples, although Constantine overdoes it slightly. The trailer gets it totally wrong, and makes it look more like an Exorcist movie, than what it eventually ends up being. Don't think it's going to be an Exorcist movie, it's so much deeper, and I ended up working out what was going to happen quite soon into the movie. So unlike me.The actors in this also do an excellent job. Everyone raves about gorgeous Kim Basinger is, but they forget she can do plain & ordinary just as well, and pulls it off. Rufus Sewell was perfect for the cult leader he played (with shades of Scientology?), and with those eyes, god I'm surprised I didn't have nightmares after watching this movie! The slight lazy eye makes him stand out from everyone else. Jimmy Smits, wow! For an older guy, he's definitely kept in shape, and looks good! I wasn't sure about Angela Bettis' character. She played it well, don't get me wrong, but from the roles I've seen her in (only this & Girl Interrupted), it's almost like she plays the anorexic, drug-addict very well. Probably cos she's ultra skinny, and needs a good feeding. Christina Ricci should have been in this movie more, as she's an excellent actress, but she's only a couple of scenes, and then gets killed - real or not?! Funky scene though, you'll jump out of your seat at this bit.The bridge where the car ""accident"" takes place is actually the Blue Water Bridge between Sarnia, Ontario and Port Huron, Michigan. It was being ""twinned"" at the time so the whole bridge was closed down for repairs and was available for numerous re-takes. The scenery shots of NYC were then placed in the background, although people who grew up there recognize the shores as being Sarnia and Pt. Huron, respectively, not NYC.The subway station where the attack on Meg takes place is a ""ghost"" station on the Toronto subway that is used frequently as a stand in for New York subways. The city's film office wanted to leave it set up as a NYC station but the Toronto fire department nixed that idea. The station is below the Bay station on the Bloor line, on the track connecting the Bloor and Yonge lines. At one time trains went from one line to the other - thus the station - but the practice was discontinued because of switching problems. (There is also a ""ghost"" station beneath the Queen Street station. It was roughed in 1954 for a planned Queen Street subway which never was built.)In the original script, a character is deliberately pushed off a subway platform. This had to be changed to an accidental fall before the Toronto Transit Commission would allow filming on its property.When the candles in the cathedral ignite together, the camera pulls back and Maggie's shirt can be seen blowing, as if the candles were in fact being blown out, and film was run backwards.The line ""the devils greatest trick was convincing man that he didn't exist"" is a reference to a similar line in another movie of the same Genre, End of Days (1999). In which Father Kovak (Rod Steiger) says: ""Satan's greatest trick was convincing man that he didn't exist."". And also to The Usual Suspects (1995) where the line ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing man that he didn't exist."" shows up.This is also based on a book, which looks good, and I managed to find it in a bookcase in our house soon after getting the DVD, so I might give that a try soon.I wouldn't believe the bad reviews that you read about this, at least if you think it looks interesting, give it a chance.

There are WAY too many plot twists and special effects that were thrown in for apparently no reason.  I won't blabber on about the story premise, but it was no surprise that the turn of the millenium would foster so many films about the apocalypse.  This film is all over the map and there is no connection to the various avenues that it approaches.Kim Bassinger is her usual twitchy self (why does she DO that?) If you don't know what I am referring to, watch 'The Real McCoy' or 'I Dreamed of Africa' or this film...she has a tendency to twitch whenever she is injured in some way.  Bassinger does well with what she was offered in this part(twitching aside) and manages to invoke emotion and realism in her somewhat altruistic character.  Jimmy Smits performance was a joke.  Should've stayed with NYPD Blue...at least his character had some depth.  Christina Ricci manages to create a believable character that surfaces from the bottom of the barrel to help save the world.

566482,A50W7ZVTG606,B0000541W8,"Naomi Tilley ""Story Buff""","[2, 2]","I saw this movie at the cinema, having previously read the book. As with most movies adapted from a novel, the movie barely barely scratched the surface of the real story.Unless you're able to sit back and watch it with an open mind, you'd end up comparing every little (and not so little) thing. You could spend hours doing this. For example, in the movie, Ghania was portrayed simply as a rather nasty looking Nanny figure (who admittedly was later revealed to be demonic) and was white, whereas in the book she was black, and an evil witch of phenomenal power. The prime nasty in the movie is Eric Stark (played nicely by Rufus Sewell); in the book he is Eric Vannier. There is also a relationship of sorts between Eric and Ghania that never made it onto the screen - probably for a very good reason. Jenna is rescued in the movie, and gives her sister Maggie full custody of Cody. In the book, Jenna is actually Maggie's daughter, and far from being saved, she ends up being ritually sacrificed by her 'loving husband' Eric, and is damned to Hell for eternity. And the final spectacular confrontation that results in Eric's death, the temporary demonic possession of Cody, and her ultimate rescue by Maggie (Grandmothers rock!) is reduced to a 'Showdown at High Noon' style finish.The movie also fails to include many crucial characters that played a vital role in rescuing Cody.I probably sound like I'm being overly critical, but read the book and you'll know where I'm coming from. Don't get me wrong - I definitely enjoyed the movie. It really wasn't anyone's fault that it came up a bit short. To fit everything in is an impossibility. To try and do that, they would have ended up with a mini-series, rather than a 2 hour film.In all honesty the only thing that really disappointed me, I suppose, were the restrictions they had to place on Cody's true nature.And in response to another previewer, no. Cody was never supposed to be autistic. This was a misdiagnosis on the part of doctors who could not comprehend any other reason for her behaviour.In the movie, Cody is simply represented as a new prophet of God, someone who is almost messianic in their current incarnation. In the book, Cody is the Isis Messenger, a promised saviour from the Goddess Isis as far back as very ancient Egypt. The Cody character from the book encompasses not only Christianity, but every other religion that focuses on good rather than evil. Likewise, the nasties in the book encompass all aspects of evil, from multiple religions and sects.All in all, the adaption was a very reasonable one. It's just hard to be completely open-minded when the book was so fantastic.I would recommend this movie. There are some real gems of moments to be found in it - particularly the mental and emotional duels that take place between Eric and Cody. Both times, Cody wins out spiritually, much to Eric's fury.There are some fine performances from Kim Basinger, Rufus Sewell, and Jimmy Smits as the priest-in-training-turned-cop who is an expert in the occult. Christina Ricci has a brief but notable role as the addict friend of Jenna who tries to escape the cult, and in the process warn Maggie of the real danger that Cody is in. The child actor who plays Cody also puts in a great performance as the little girl who is far more than she appears.The movie lacks a little in substance, but that is more a time constraint problem than the fault of the director or the actors. They do a damned fine job with the material they have to work with. This is a movie worth having, but get the book as well.Even if you aren't that much of a reader, this one is worth it.",3,Reasonable Effort,1042416000,"01 13, 2003",2003,3641,"['saw', 'movie', 'cinema', 'having', 'previously', 'read', 'book', 'most', 'movies', 'adapted', 'novel', 'movie', 'barely', 'barely', 'scratched', 'surface', 'real', 'story.Unless', ""'re"", 'able', 'sit', 'back', 'watch', 'open', 'mind', ""'d"", 'end', 'up', 'comparing', 'little', 'not', 'so', 'little', 'thing', 'could', 'spend', 'hours', 'doing', 'example', 'movie', 'Ghania', 'was', 'portrayed', 'simply', 'rather', 'nasty', 'looking', 'Nanny', 'figure', 'who', 'admittedly', 'was', 'later', 'revealed', 'be', 'demonic', 'was', 'white', 'whereas', 'book', 'was', 'black', 'evil', 'witch', 'phenomenal', 'power', 'prime', 'nasty', 'movie', 'Eric', 'Stark', 'played', 'nicely', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'book', 'Eric', 'Vannier', 'also', 'relationship', 'sorts', 'Eric', 'Ghania', 'never', 'made', 'screen', 'probably', 'very', 'good', 'reason', 'Jenna', 'rescued', 'movie', 'sister', 'Maggie', 'full', 'custody', 'Cody', 'book', 'Jenna', 'actually', 'Maggie', 'daughter', 'far', 'being', 'saved', 'up', 'being', 'ritually', 'sacrificed', ""'loving"", 'husband', 'Eric', 'damned', 'Hell', 'eternity', 'final', 'spectacular', 'confrontation', 'results', 'Eric', 'death', 'temporary', 'demonic', 'possession', 'Cody', 'ultimate', 'rescue', 'Maggie', 'Grandmothers', 'rock', 'reduced', ""'Showdown"", 'High', 'Noon', 'style', 'finish.The', 'movie', 'also', 'include', 'many', 'crucial', 'characters', 'played', 'vital', 'role', 'rescuing', 'Cody.I', 'probably', 'sound', ""'m"", 'being', 'overly', 'critical', 'read', 'book', ""'ll"", 'know', 'where', ""'m"", 'coming', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'definitely', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'fault', 'came', 'up', 'bit', 'short', 'fit', 'everything', 'impossibility', 'try', 'do', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'mini-series', 'rather', '2', 'hour', 'film.In', 'honesty', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'disappointed', 'suppose', 'were', 'restrictions', 'had', 'place', 'Cody', 'true', 'nature.And', 'response', 'previewer', 'Cody', 'was', 'never', 'supposed', 'be', 'autistic', 'was', 'misdiagnosis', 'part', 'doctors', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'comprehend', 'other', 'reason', 'behaviour.In', 'movie', 'Cody', 'simply', 'represented', 'new', 'prophet', 'God', 'someone', 'who', 'almost', 'messianic', 'current', 'incarnation', 'book', 'Cody', 'Isis', 'Messenger', 'promised', 'saviour', 'Goddess', 'Isis', 'far', 'back', 'very', 'ancient', 'Egypt', 'Cody', 'character', 'book', 'not', 'only', 'Christianity', 'other', 'religion', 'good', 'rather', 'evil', 'Likewise', 'nasties', 'book', 'encompass', 'aspects', 'evil', 'multiple', 'religions', 'sects.All', 'adaption', 'was', 'very', 'reasonable', 'one', 'just', 'hard', 'be', 'completely', 'open-minded', 'when', 'book', 'was', 'so', 'fantastic.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'are', 'real', 'gems', 'moments', 'be', 'found', 'particularly', 'mental', 'emotional', 'duels', 'take', 'place', 'Eric', 'Cody', 'Both', 'times', 'Cody', 'out', 'spiritually', 'much', 'Eric', 'are', 'fine', 'performances', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'priest-in-training-turned-cop', 'who', 'expert', 'occult', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'brief', 'notable', 'role', 'addict', 'friend', 'Jenna', 'who', 'escape', 'cult', 'process', 'warn', 'Maggie', 'real', 'danger', 'Cody', 'child', 'actor', 'who', 'Cody', 'also', 'great', 'performance', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'far', 'more', 'appears.The', 'movie', 'little', 'substance', 'more', 'time', 'constraint', 'problem', 'fault', 'director', 'actors', 'do', 'damned', 'fine', 'job', 'material', 'have', 'work', 'movie', 'worth', 'having', 'get', 'book', 'well.Even', 'are', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'reader', 'one']",Bless the Child

Then when the same critics are overwhelmingly praising an exercise in excess like the new ""King Kong"", you begin to wonder if their judgment can be trusted about a film like ""Bless the Child"". Not that ""Bless the Child"" is a small independent film, it had a $40 Million budget although there is little sign much of that money actually made it onto the screen; except that the DVD has far more extensive special features than some low-budget production.Anyway, if you are curious enough to view ""Bless the Child"" and if your expectations are modest, you should find it a pleasant surprise. Not because of Ricci (who has only two scenes although both are done well). Or because of Holm (who makes an extremely short appearance of little consequence). And not because of Bettis, although she gets a fair amount of screen time and has one especially good scene at the start of the film. And not because of top billed Kim Basinger and Jimmy Smits, who give competent if unexceptional performances.The real star is young Holliston Coleman (best known as the ""Me"" in the television movie ""Miss Lettie and Me"") as six year old Cody. Director Chuck Russell (The Mask,"" ""Eraser"") gets a restrained but glowing performance from Coleman as a six-year-old savior sent by God to restore mankind's faith. At the start of the film, a strung-out Bettis brings then 9-day old Cody for a long over-due visit with older sister Maggie, a NYC psychological nurse. Once Maggie starts fussing with the baby, Bettis sneaks out, leaving Cody behind to be raised by Maggie.At first it is thought that Cody is autistic but when she starts resurrecting dead birds and performing small scale miracles her Aunt Maggie (Basinger) begins to realize that she is something else. Without the right actress and the right level of performance this whole idea would be truly awful, but Coleman deftly alternates between playful and serious, giving the character a believability that has to be seen to (dare we say it) be believed.The suspense is provided by a self-empowerment guru named Eric Stark (Rufus Sewell), who is actually an agent of the devil and intends to kill Cody if he cannot turn her to the dark side. Stark first appears about midway into the film, which begins to go steadily downhill from that point.There are a couple of good thrills (including a bedroom full of rats), one great scare (the nanny's face changes suddenly and unexpectedly into that of a demon), and some lame special effects stuff that doesn't work well (Maggie's drive against the flow of traffic). In a cool and perversely funny scene Maggie threatens Eric with a gun and he says, ""Are you really going to shoot me? Right here in front of Cody?""

Rufus Sewell portrays the role of a cult-leader nicely without going over the top. Jimmy Smits doesnt seem too inspired in this film, but nevertheless gives an okay performance. Holliston Coleman, the girl who plays Cody, does an excellent job in her role. Kim Basinger comes off bland throughout most of the movie, and the role Christina Ricci plays shouldve been extended to more than just two short scenes.The plot has obvious major holes that drag the movie down if you sit &amp; disect them. And some scenes are ridiculously laughable / over-the-top. For example, a bird flys head-first into a Catholic-school window as Cody looks on. Next thing you know, all of the children are outside gathering around Cody as she holds it, while the nuns and Cody's aunt (Basinger) watch and laugh whole-heartedly, not caring about the health issues that could arise from a 6 year old girl holding a seemingly dead bird she picked up off the ground.Little things..Characters always being in the right place at the right time. Smits' character always finding clues and evidence that the dozens of cops at the scene seem to always overlook.

It can be categorized as a supernatural thriller or even as a horror film, but it is more than that.  In the story, Jenna has just given birth to an autistic girl named Cody. Jenna abandons Cody, however, leaving her sister Maggie to raise her. After six years, Maggie begins to discover that there is more going on with Cody than autism. Cody is showing signs that she is gifted with amazing powers that could only come from God, including the power to heal dead birds. It seems that Cody is destined for greatness. As you would expect from this kind of movie, however, there are forces who want to use Cody's power for evil. Cody is kidnapped by a cult leader who intends to kill her if he is unable to turn her. Maggie must find the cult leader and rescue Cody before it is too late. There is plenty of action and drama mixed in with the thrills and scares, including chase scenes, an exploding car, and an extremely chilling scene of a young boy being lured into a kidnapping. There are some very moving moments as well, including one in which Cody tells a homeless man that God has not forgotten him. Overall, this is a fantastic movie. Compared with others that focus on the traditional theme of ""good versus evil,"" this is definitely one of the better ones.",5,"One of the Better ""Good Versus Evil"" Films",1382659200,"10 25, 2013",2013,1351,"['Child', 'not', 'easiest', 'movie', 'classify', 'one', 'strengths', 'can', 'be', 'categorized', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'even', 'horror', 'film', 'more', 'story', 'Jenna', 'just', 'given', 'birth', 'autistic', 'girl', 'named', 'Cody', 'Jenna', 'abandons', 'Cody', 'however', 'leaving', 'sister', 'Maggie', 'raise', 'six', 'years', 'Maggie', 'discover', 'more', 'going', 'Cody', 'autism', 'Cody', 'showing', 'signs', 'gifted', 'amazing', 'powers', 'could', 'only', 'come', 'God', 'including', 'power', 'heal', 'dead', 'birds', 'Cody', 'destined', 'greatness', 'would', 'expect', 'kind', 'movie', 'however', 'are', 'forces', 'who', 'want', 'use', 'Cody', 'power', 'evil', 'Cody', 'kidnapped', 'cult', 'leader', 'who', 'kill', 'unable', 'turn', 'Maggie', 'must', 'find', 'cult', 'leader', 'rescue', 'Cody', 'too', 'late', 'plenty', 'action', 'drama', 'mixed', 'thrills', 'scares', 'including', 'chase', 'scenes', 'exploding', 'car', 'extremely', 'chilling', 'scene', 'young', 'boy', 'being', 'lured', 'kidnapping', 'are', 'very', 'moving', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'one', 'Cody', 'homeless', 'man', 'God', 'not', 'forgotten', 'Overall', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'Compared', 'others', 'focus', 'traditional', 'theme', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'definitely', 'one', 'better', 'ones']",Bless the Child

Subtlity is thrown out of the script, even if there was such a thing in the first draft.

Her co-stars are also good, including Jimmy Smits, Rufus Sewell, Angela Bettis (&quot;Girl Interrupted,&quot; &quot;Sparrow&quot;), all doing great job.  On top of that, there is Christina Ricci.  But, good as their actings are, they are not so memorable as they should be after all.The reason lies in the way the film is directed.  As soon as emotional tension between the actors is created to inspire the familiar story, the director, discarding the inspiration, goes to CGI extravaganza next, to destroy the atomosphere delicately staged by actors.  So, after you see Basinger playing the mother's role pretty impressively (touching), you see lots of rats swarming in a room (Uhh!).  Or, after we see Angela Bettis showing a skillful acting as a distracted drug addict and cult member, we see ... eh, a car crashing on a bridge, or a policeman hit by a car (yes, car again).  It is like riding a roller-roaster, and sometimes creepy, to be sure, but the thrill gets thinner as he film goes on.  Like &quot;The Exocist,&quot; the film portrays the ultimate battle between the good and the evil, but fails to capture the sinister atomosphere of the masterpiece.So, let's face it.  This is not a horror movie; it's more like a horror action movie, and you should make a new category for &quot;Bless the Child.&quot;  I enjoyed watching it, but I really doubt the actors are happy to see their efforts turned into a concocted chain of instant excitement.  My conclusion: if you  define good horror movies by a refined script with good acting, avoid it.  If you're not, it's an OK film.",3,Cursed by CGI,1010534400,"01 9, 2002",2002,2384,"['matter', 'how', 'bad', 'may', 'find', 'quot', 'Bless', 'Child', 'quot', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'worthless', 'produced', 'Mace', 'Neufeld', 'who', 'also', 'produced', 'quot', 'Omen', 'quot', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'so', 'like', 'latter', 'may', 'take', 'look', 'quot', 'Bless', 'Child.', 'quot', 'problem', 'quot', 'Bless', 'Child', 'quot', 'satisfiy', 'audience', 'sacrifice', 'coherence', 'probability', 'Subtlity', 'thrown', 'script', 'even', 'was', 'such', 'thing', 'first', 'draft', 'Interesting', 'thing', 'film', 'certain', 'degree', 'method', 'success', 'also', 'killed', 'delicate', 'side', 'depict', 'fight', 'good', 'evil.For', 'example', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'fairly', 'good', 'performance', 'protector', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'wanted', 'cult', 'group', 'co-stars', 'are', 'also', 'good', 'including', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'quot', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'quot', 'quot', 'Sparrow', 'quot', 'doing', 'great', 'job', 'top', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'good', 'actings', 'are', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'memorable', 'should', 'be', 'all.The', 'reason', 'way', 'film', 'directed', 'As', 'soon', 'emotional', 'tension', 'actors', 'created', 'inspire', 'familiar', 'story', 'director', 'discarding', 'inspiration', 'CGI', 'extravaganza', 'next', 'destroy', 'atomosphere', 'delicately', 'staged', 'actors', 'So', 'see', 'Basinger', 'playing', 'mother', 'role', 'pretty', 'impressively', 'touching', 'see', 'lots', 'rats', 'swarming', 'room', 'Uhh', 'see', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'showing', 'skillful', 'acting', 'distracted', 'drug', 'addict', 'cult', 'member', 'see', 'eh', 'car', 'crashing', 'bridge', 'policeman', 'hit', 'car', 'yes', 'car', 'again', 'riding', 'roller-roaster', 'sometimes', 'creepy', 'be', 'sure', 'thrill', 'thinner', 'film', 'quot', 'Exocist', 'quot', 'film', 'ultimate', 'battle', 'good', 'evil', 'capture', 'sinister', 'atomosphere', 'masterpiece.So', 'let', 'face', 'not', 'horror', 'movie', 'more', 'horror', 'action', 'movie', 'should', 'make', 'new', 'category', 'quot', 'Bless', 'Child.', 'quot', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'really', 'doubt', 'actors', 'are', 'happy', 'see', 'efforts', 'turned', 'concocted', 'chain', 'instant', 'excitement', 'conclusion', 'define', 'good', 'horror', 'movies', 'refined', 'script', 'good', 'acting', 'avoid', ""'re"", 'not', 'OK', 'film']",Bless the Child

Theisen ""Bippy Video""","[1, 1]","This movie is a must-have for spiritual/religious-type film buffs.I purchased this movie in a Wal-Mart ""$5.50 Bin"" expecting nothing more than a few cheap thrills and something to watch while enjoying a bowl of popcorn.It was much more than that. I will not go into details, you can read those in the Amazon review. What I will say, though, is that Kim Basinger did a fantastic job of acting in this one. Her character exuded warmth and strength simultaneously. I actually cared for her character and wanted the good to overcome with tremendous conviction. The story had depth and a somewhat believable premise, if not convoluted slightly (but not too much to take away from the edge-of-your-seat thrills).

566507,A15DDVD2TD77B9,B0000541W8,"""viewmaster""","[1, 1]","Unlike most movies in the religous horror genre, Bless the Child manages to get the theological aspect pretty right, (even though a vision of a child as antichrist or, as in this film, a new savior, have no basis beyond &quot;The Omen&quot;). It seems to take that aspect seriously, and so much the better.There is a good story here, well told for the most part. Things generally remains subdued yet manages to create some creepy moments. The cast is strong. Kim Basinger seems to have a great connection with Holliston Coleman, who plays little Cody. Rufus Sewell makes a smart and compelling villian. And Jimmy Smits makes a good showing here to. The visual side of Bless the Child is workman like, but certainly thoughtful and professional. And the effects, though obvious, are certainly effective.Despite these good marks, there are quite a few questionable ones. Just as the acting is good, it's also uninspired. There doesn't seem to be a high level of passion among anyone involved. And there are quite a few side characters, namely Christina Ricci, who are meakly realized. Some of the horror elements divert from the films tone as well. I'm always up for some gore, but it needs to be well utilized. There are some scenes here that seem outright goofy in relation to the rest of the movie, if not just a little illogical. The end is also something of a let down. It's not bad but it does seem a little shallow. I just felt there should have been a little something more.Still, I must recommend Bless the Child. Though there are faults, director Chuck Russell obviously took this film very seriously. It's a tale told with care. That always shows.Even if the absolute glee that some of the classics in this genre exhibit, isn't apparent here.",3,Predictable but genuine,1002240000,"10 5, 2001",2001,1750,"['most', 'movies', 'religous', 'horror', 'genre', 'Bless', 'Child', 'get', 'theological', 'aspect', 'pretty', 'right', 'even', 'vision', 'child', 'antichrist', 'film', 'new', 'savior', 'have', 'basis', 'quot', 'Omen', 'quot', 'take', 'aspect', 'seriously', 'so', 'much', 'better.There', 'good', 'story', 'here', 'well', 'told', 'most', 'part', 'Things', 'generally', 'subdued', 'yet', 'manages', 'create', 'creepy', 'moments', 'cast', 'strong', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'have', 'great', 'connection', 'Holliston', 'Coleman', 'who', 'little', 'Cody', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'smart', 'compelling', 'villian', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'good', 'showing', 'here', 'visual', 'side', 'Bless', 'Child', 'workman', 'certainly', 'thoughtful', 'professional', 'effects', 'though', 'obvious', 'are', 'certainly', 'good', 'marks', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'questionable', 'ones', 'Just', 'acting', 'good', 'also', 'uninspired', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'high', 'level', 'passion', 'anyone', 'involved', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'side', 'characters', 'namely', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'who', 'are', 'meakly', 'realized', 'horror', 'elements', 'divert', 'films', 'tone', 'as', 'well', ""'m"", 'always', 'up', 'gore', 'be', 'well', 'utilized', 'are', 'scenes', 'here', 'seem', 'outright', 'goofy', 'relation', 'rest', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'little', 'illogical', 'end', 'also', 'something', 'let', 'down', 'not', 'bad', 'seem', 'little', 'shallow', 'just', 'felt', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'something', 'more.Still', 'must', 'recommend', 'Bless', 'Child', 'are', 'faults', 'director', 'Chuck', 'Russell', 'obviously', 'took', 'film', 'very', 'seriously', 'tale', 'told', 'care', 'always', 'shows.Even', 'absolute', 'glee', 'classics', 'genre', 'exhibit', ""n't"", 'apparent', 'here']",Bless the Child
