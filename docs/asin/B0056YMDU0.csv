I really like the Shrek The Halls (and recommend it), but I think this one is even better.  It brings back elements from all four of the movies.  The 'Information Booth' of Castle Dulac is also back - I laughed my a** off at that scene!  I have read reviews that this is a bit too scary for smaller children.  For anybody who is unfamilar with Dreamworks animation work, they are usually aimed towards older children, teens and definitely adults.  They are NOT for smaller children.The stories in this and humor are great.  The elements, such as the rivalry between Donkey and Puss, are there.  The Thriller video spoof is done great.

1444380,A2BXUP2XVJ9YQN,B0056YMDU0,Erica,"[0, 0]","Its about a 21 minute short film (plus the short play out of the characters version of the music video Thriller by Michael Jackson!). Very cute for Halloween and good for all ages, including adults! It has all of the original characters from the Shrek movies in it who all all decide to tell scary stories to each other on Halloween night to see who would get scared first. They all come up with really cute silly stories but a couple do get a little scary for young ones. It has references to horror movies like The Exorcist and zombies which can spook really young kids, so probably any age over 4 or 5 would enjoy this movie. You're better of purchasing the new combo pack that was just released of ALL the Shrek & Monsters vs. Aliens Halloween movies though instead (which includes this one) that are out called Dreamworks Shrek's Spooky Stories.

1444382,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0056YMDU0,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","I guess when it comes to holiday programming, you could say that I'm fairly old fashioned. The classics that I grew up with when there weren't as many television options became yearly traditions--by familiarity, if not always quality. Today, with hundreds of stations to select from, kids can be more choosy. And yet, I'm still rarely blown away by the options presented. When Dreamworks, therefore, adopted two of its film franchises into new Halloween spectaculars--I was a bit skeptical. The original ""Shrek"" was one of my all time beloved movies although the series was beginning to show wear, while ""Monsters vs Aliens"" may have had its moments but it wasn't a particular favorite of mine. I was, therefore, pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed these two brief specials. ""Scared Shrekless"" and ""Monsters vs Aliens: Mutant Pumpkins From Outer Space"" can be purchased individually, but certainly qualify as a better deal in a combination pack if you want both. Note: These aired as 30 minutes specials with commercials--so approximate running times are about 22 minutes each if that makes a difference in your buying choice.In ""Scared Shrekless,"" the ogre family and their friends are enjoying Shrek's favorite holiday--you guessed it, Halloween! A wager is set forth in which everyone will tell a creepy tale and the last to get scared wins! Then the individual narratives unfold (kind of like a Simpson's Treehouse of Terrors) and classic horror stories get a decidedly unique spin through the land of fairy tales. The program uses the familiar characters to excellent affect and (despite the absence of Eddie Murphy) these two-dimensional creations display remarkable life. The horror parodies are spot-on (I won't spoil anything here) and hilarious. Still creepy, though, this definitely plays well to an older audience. Young kids, as in every ""Shrek,"" will miss the in-jokes and cultural references but should still enjoy the manic pacing. I've got to tell you, I quite loved this special. To me, it was more engaging than the Christmas themed ""Shrek The Halls."" Still funny, the ""Shrek"" franchise has survived on showcasing the strength of having a strong circle of family and friends--and that certainly shines here too amidst the lunacy.

I bought the short Shrek The Halls Christmas movie and loved it.  I really hope they keep Shrek alive, even if it is with shorts like this.  Scared Shrekless isn't completely horrible, but I'm very disappointed in it.  I paid $10 for a slopped together Halloween special.  At best, this should be a $5 DVD.I will say this, Scared Shrekless isn't for very young or sensitive children.  There is no axe murders or anything like that, but there is a lot of material that I myself believe would scare a younger child.  As one reviewer said the ""Shreckcorist"" part of the cartoon was weird and creepy, to a child I can only imagine what it could seem like.  The little information booth in Dulop castle has the puppets singing things like ""We'll chop off your head then laugh when you're dead"" and has a burning priest/judge puppet.  If you think you kids can handle it, I suggest watching it with them and gauge their reactions.There really is no target age for this.  Too scary for young kids, to short and goofy for the older ones.  It just lacks the magic of Shrek.On the upside, there are a lot of parts that made me laugh.  I enjoyed it to some extent.  It wasn't a complete loss and I'm just thankful Shrek is staying alive.  However, I felt the need to caution parents for their children's sakes and inform you that it just isn't worth the money.

When an argument erupts between Shrek and some of his friends, a wager is made to see who can tell the scariest story of them all. Shrek agrees to the deal, but only if the competition is held at a place he selects. Everyone agrees and Shrek, Donkey, Gingy, Puss, the Three Pigs, the Wolf, and Pinnochio set forth to the storytelling place: the abandoned city and castle of Duloc. One by one the friends tell a spooky story, but not all remain until the end as those who are frightened leave. Gingy tells a story about zombie gingerbread people, Donkey and Puss tell a competing overlapping tales in an attempt to outdo and outfrighten each other, and Shrek tells a story of a possessed little boy. The short is mildly frightening for younger children who will, nonetheless, enjoy this special just for the Shrek characters.
