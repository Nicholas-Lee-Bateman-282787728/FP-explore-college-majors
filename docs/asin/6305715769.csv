While trying to make a point about how women are exploited in films, the movie has its romantic leading female running around topless or in see-through tops for half the film. That's just one of the many examples of gross hypocrisy evident throughout the film. If you want to see more, then by all means, check out this &quot;edgy and hip comedy.&quot;",1,as egotistical and shallow as Bono himself,970617600,"10 4, 2000",2000,490,"['movie', 'points', 'make', 'movie', 'quot', 'quot', 'even', 'base', 'attempt', 'being', 'funny', 'trying', 'make', 'point', 'how', 'women', 'are', 'exploited', 'films', 'movie', 'romantic', 'leading', 'female', 'running', 'around', 'topless', 'see-through', 'tops', 'film', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'examples', 'gross', 'hypocrisy', 'evident', 'film', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'then', 'means', 'check', 'out', 'quot', 'hip', 'comedy.', 'quot']",Entropy VHS
474029,A11GVIS6AXDEAX,6305715769,James Chong,"[1, 3]","I randomly ran across this film while browsing through cable channels one afternoon. What immediately struck me was the clean and polished visual presentation (in both set design and photography) and the fact that the central characters, while looking like the typically vapid, self-absorbed, hypocritical yuppies that normally populate films of this genre (the urban, contemporary romantic dramedy), actually seemed to have some interesting things to say. I ended up watching the rest of the film and enjoying it immensely.The writing did, at times, feel a bit smug (as if Joanou actually believed that he was saying something that hadn't been said before), but this was forgivable in light of the interesting visual and narrative risks he was willing to take in the film. Also, I was drawn in to Stephen Dorff's refined but energetic performance. The talking cat was a bit gimmicky, but really was quite funny, with some special effects that would put the creators of the abysmal &quot;Cats and Dogs&quot; to shame.So, yes, I did enjoy the film and thought it was well worth watching, but I wouldn't go so far (as some reviewers here have) to say that it even compares with Spike Jonze's brilliant, visionary work in &quot;Being John Malkovich.&quot; I'm sorry, kids, but a talking cat does not measure up to the tweaked, surreal universe that Jonze was able to bring to life in that film. Also, it seems that most of the reviewers here erroneously believed this film to be Phil Joanou's first feature film since his music video days. Not at all true. Go rent &quot;State of Grace,&quot; which he directed back in 1990. It is about the Irish mob in New York and stars Sean Penn, Gary Oldman, Ed Harris, John Turturro, John C. Reilly, and Robin Wright (my god, what a cast). It is arguably one of the greatest gangster films ever made, and simply dwarfs &quot;Entropy,&quot; as good as it is, in terms of cinematic achievement. The performances are simply flawless across the board.

I had seen, i'm sure like most others who found this  movie, as a preview before a rented movie and the only reason i got it was  because of the talking cat , which i thought looked hilarious, and also the  fact that U2 was in it seemed to give it some credibility, even though i  knew in the back of my head that Stephen Dorff isn't the greatest actor.  Phil Joanou (director of the film...i think that's how you spell it) should  stick to music videos because he defintely has a knack for cool shots, and  visuals (the reason i gave this two stars), but unfortunately forgot that  no matter how much style and flash you put on, its a good story that sells  a movie, not visual effects.

The acting was VERY good. The music was even better. And it was filled with unexpected moments that spiced it up all the way. Reminded me a lot of 'Being John Malkovich'.Talks about things you can relate in more than one way... about how you can let good things go away, blinded by other things that momentarily look like they can fill your life... but not for long.I absolutely recommend it... I also wish (like one of the other reviewers) they released the soundtrack.

474032,A82LIVYSX6WZ9,6305715769,Michael Bolts,"[2, 6]","Stephen Dorff (Blade, Cecil B. Demented) plays a music video director who becomes a movie director. The film he's working on is a period piece. In filming this movie he falls in love with a French model, Judith Godreche (?),  and they becoming in love and their relationship blossoms. He works on the movie while she models but she thinks he's getting a little carried away on his work. Things happen like in all relationships especially if its a director or an actor and their girlfriend has a jealous fit of rage. So, Godreche goes to Europe for a shoot while Dorff stays back in the US finishing directing the picture. Godreche breaks it off with Dorff because she is seeing someone else, so Dorff is also kicked off the movie so he goes back to doing music videos for the rock band U2 (Bono, Larry, Edge). Dorff meets this a irish woman, Kelly MacDonald (Gosford Park, Finding Neverland), and desides he wants to get married to her right away. Bono of U2 who appears on a television screen tries to convince him not to but Dorff ignores Bono and the 2 love birds get married (its videotaped) in Las Vegas with Elvis playing guitar in the background. Godreche wants to get back with Dorff but Dorff is married to MacDonald...so at the U2 concert, while U2 is playing Mysterious Ways....they show Dorff's wedding video..so Godreche sees it..she runs off and also his friends tell him he's back on the movie so it's this intwinded sort of thing going on..hence the title of the movie..Entropy. Dorff is extremely good but some of it is a little cheesy but hey, what can you say with a movie that has the guys from U2 in it? Godreche as the french girl is miscast but Kelly MacDonald..the shorthair irish girl is cute as ever. Also starring Lauren Holly (Dumb and Dumber, Any Given Sunday), Jon Tenney (Buying The Cow, Fools Rush In) and Paul Guilfoyle (Tv's CSI:Las Vegas, Session 9).",3,You cant say no to a movie with Bono,1101772800,"11 30, 2004",2004,1885,"['Stephen', 'Dorff', 'Blade', 'Cecil', 'B.', 'Demented', 'music', 'video', 'director', 'who', 'movie', 'director', 'film', 'working', 'period', 'piece', 'filming', 'movie', 'love', 'French', 'model', 'Judith', 'Godreche', 'becoming', 'love', 'relationship', 'blossoms', 'movie', 'models', 'getting', 'little', 'carried', 'away', 'work', 'Things', 'happen', 'relationships', 'especially', 'director', 'actor', 'girlfriend', 'jealous', 'fit', 'rage', 'So', 'Godreche', 'Europe', 'shoot', 'Dorff', 'back', 'US', 'finishing', 'directing', 'picture', 'Godreche', 'off', 'Dorff', 'seeing', 'someone', 'else', 'Dorff', 'also', 'kicked', 'off', 'movie', 'back', 'doing', 'music', 'videos', 'rock', 'band', 'U2', 'Bono', 'Larry', 'Edge', 'Dorff', 'irish', 'woman', 'Kelly', 'MacDonald', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'get', 'married', 'right', 'away', 'Bono', 'U2', 'who', 'television', 'screen', 'convince', 'not', 'Dorff', 'Bono', '2', 'love', 'birds', 'get', 'married', 'videotaped', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Elvis', 'playing', 'guitar', 'background', 'Godreche', 'get', 'back', 'Dorff', 'Dorff', 'married', 'MacDonald', 'so', 'U2', 'concert', 'U2', 'playing', 'Mysterious', 'Ways', '.they', 'show', 'Dorff', 'wedding', 'video..so', 'Godreche', 'it..she', 'also', 'friends', 'tell', 'back', 'movie', 'intwinded', 'sort', 'thing', 'going', 'title', 'movie..Entropy', 'Dorff', 'extremely', 'good', 'little', 'cheesy', 'hey', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'guys', 'U2', 'Godreche', 'french', 'girl', 'miscast', 'Kelly', 'MacDonald..the', 'shorthair', 'irish', 'girl', 'cute', 'ever', 'Also', 'starring', 'Lauren', 'Holly', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'Any', 'Given', 'Sunday', 'Jon', 'Tenney', 'Buying', 'Cow', 'Fools', 'Rush', 'Paul', 'Guilfoyle', 'Tv', 'CSI', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Session', '9']",Entropy VHS

When a director who does movies for U2 (and pretty much almost ruins U2 in the process) gets Bono and U2 to provide cameos for his movie, you kind of hope that he'll get a real story out of it. Instead it looks like his life story. And his life story isn't all that interesting.Briefly, hotshot video director gets a picture deal. Ends up with a model girlfriend. Life is good until he realizes that he can't deal with the producer and he lets the girlfriend fall by the wayside. He begins to drink and smoke a lot. Somewhere along the lines he gets married to Kelly MacDonald whose a little more irritating than she was in Trainspotting, but still great at stealing movies out from under the angst-ridden stars. Eventually he is left with nothing but the wisdom from his experience (and a film script).It's a pretty good movie. It's just that I've seen the immature artistic type learns how to grow up through a failed relationship before. It's a fairly novel approach I know, call it a Chick movie for guys. And where actual chick movies can have men who are more or less window dressing, a guy movie needs a little more going on if you are going to sit for 2 hours watching a guy blather on about his feelings.And where this movie fails is the girlfriend character. She's written poorly and the actress is not good enough to get anything out of the character. This is why Kelly MacDonald with her annoying accent and obnoxiousness steals the movie. She can act. The other chick just sort of emotes. At the end of the movie you are left wondering what he ever saw in this woman in the first place. She's cute. They have sex on the first date and she's got a silly little accent. That's about it.But still it's an enjoyable little movie. And the talking cat cracks me up. Great if you are a U2 fan.",3,I might have liked it better if I hadn't seen High Fidelity,989280000,"05 8, 2001",2001,1827,"['Ah', 'confessional', 'genre', 'When', 'director', 'who', 'movies', 'U2', 'pretty', 'much', 'almost', 'U2', 'process', 'Bono', 'U2', 'provide', 'cameos', 'movie', 'kind', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'get', 'real', 'story', 'Instead', 'life', 'story', 'life', 'story', ""n't"", 'interesting.Briefly', 'hotshot', 'video', 'director', 'picture', 'deal', 'up', 'model', 'girlfriend', 'Life', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deal', 'producer', 'girlfriend', 'fall', 'wayside', 'drink', 'smoke', 'lot', 'Somewhere', 'lines', 'married', 'Kelly', 'MacDonald', 'little', 'more', 'irritating', 'was', 'Trainspotting', 'still', 'great', 'stealing', 'movies', 'angst-ridden', 'stars', 'Eventually', 'left', 'nothing', 'wisdom', 'experience', 'film', 'script', '.It', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'just', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'immature', 'artistic', 'type', 'how', 'grow', 'up', 'failed', 'relationship', 'fairly', 'novel', 'approach', 'know', 'call', 'Chick', 'movie', 'guys', 'where', 'actual', 'chick', 'movies', 'can', 'have', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'window', 'dressing', 'guy', 'movie', 'little', 'more', 'going', 'are', 'going', 'sit', '2', 'hours', 'watching', 'guy', 'blather', 'feelings.And', 'where', 'movie', 'girlfriend', 'character', 'written', 'poorly', 'actress', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'get', 'anything', 'character', 'why', 'Kelly', 'MacDonald', 'annoying', 'accent', 'obnoxiousness', 'steals', 'movie', 'can', 'act', 'other', 'chick', 'just', 'sort', 'emotes', 'end', 'movie', 'are', 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'ever', 'saw', 'woman', 'first', 'place', 'cute', 'have', 'sex', 'first', 'date', 'got', 'silly', 'little', 'accent', 'it.But', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'little', 'movie', 'talking', 'cat', 'cracks', 'up', 'Great', 'are', 'U2', 'fan']",Entropy VHS
