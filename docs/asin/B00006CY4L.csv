712372,A282A0P69UT137,B00006CY4L,"Captain Hornblower ""captainhornblower""","[9, 34]","The four episodes in this volume of Farscape Season 2 is a mixed bag.Beware of Dog-The crew must battle a deadly parasite that can change forms and is intent on killing and consuming Moya's crew.  This is a simple action/adventure episode, but it is an excellent episode for its great use of characters, witty dialogue, and fun storyline.  It also has some twists and turns along the way that keep you guessing.Won't Get Fooled, Again-Crichton finds himself in a strange simulation of his life back on Earth which turns out to be the work of a Scarren interrogator.  This is perhaps the worst episode of Farscape ever because of its razor thin story, overly weird elements, corny humor, and downright disgusting subtexts including, but not limited to, oedipal imagery involving Crichton's Mother.  This episode is weird just for the sake of being weird.The Locket-Aeryn returns to Moya on a transport pod after surveying a strange cloud that Moya has flown into.  The catch-she is over 100 cycles (years) old.  Now, Crichton follows her into a parallel universe, where the two grow old together, but must return to save Moya from becoming trapped in time.  This is a very touching and emotionally compelling episode with fantastic performances by Ben Browder and Claudia Black.  This episode also sees the return of Paul Goddard as Stark, the Banik slave that escaped with Crichton from Scorpius' Gammack Base in ""the Hidden Memory"".The Ugly Truth-Moya's crew is put on trial by a race called the Plokavians for Talyn's destruction of one of their ships.  Each are interrogated and relate their version of the chain of events that led to the Plokavian ship's accidental destruction.  But will the Plokavian's believe their innocence?  This is a good episode, but unfortunately suffers from the fact that it repeats the same chain of events at least five times from five different points of view.  The result is an episode that is rather slow at times, but still has some good moments to it.So, the end result is a volume of Farscape Season 2 that has two not to be missed episodes for different reasons (Beware of Dog and the Locket) and another episode that is good and worth seeing.  Just skip over Won't Get Fooled, Again, when you watch it, and you won't be disappointed.",3,"Some great episodes, and one incredibly poor one.",1032048000,"09 15, 2002",2002,2275,"['four', 'episodes', 'volume', 'Farscape', 'Season', '2', 'mixed', 'bag.Beware', 'Dog-The', 'crew', 'must', 'battle', 'deadly', 'parasite', 'can', 'change', 'forms', 'intent', 'killing', 'consuming', 'Moya', 'crew', 'simple', 'action/adventure', 'episode', 'excellent', 'episode', 'great', 'use', 'characters', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'fun', 'storyline', 'also', 'twists', 'along', 'way', 'keep', 'guessing.Wo', ""n't"", 'Get', 'Fooled', 'Again-Crichton', 'strange', 'simulation', 'life', 'back', 'Earth', 'out', 'be', 'work', 'Scarren', 'interrogator', 'perhaps', 'worst', 'episode', 'Farscape', 'ever', 'razor', 'thin', 'story', 'overly', 'weird', 'elements', 'corny', 'humor', 'downright', 'disgusting', 'subtexts', 'including', 'not', 'limited', 'oedipal', 'imagery', 'involving', 'Crichton', 'Mother', 'episode', 'weird', 'just', 'sake', 'being', 'weird.The', 'Locket-Aeryn', 'returns', 'Moya', 'transport', 'pod', 'surveying', 'strange', 'cloud', 'Moya', 'flown', 'catch-she', '100', 'cycles', 'years', 'old', 'Now', 'Crichton', 'parallel', 'universe', 'where', 'two', 'grow', 'old', 'together', 'must', 'return', 'save', 'Moya', 'becoming', 'trapped', 'time', 'very', 'touching', 'emotionally', 'compelling', 'episode', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'Ben', 'Browder', 'Claudia', 'Black', 'episode', 'also', 'return', 'Paul', 'Goddard', 'Stark', 'Banik', 'slave', 'escaped', 'Crichton', 'Scorpius', 'Gammack', 'Base', 'Hidden', 'Memory', '.The', 'Ugly', 'Truth-Moya', 'crew', 'put', 'trial', 'race', 'called', 'Plokavians', 'Talyn', 'destruction', 'one', 'ships', 'are', 'interrogated', 'relate', 'version', 'chain', 'events', 'led', 'Plokavian', 'ship', 'accidental', 'destruction', 'will', 'Plokavian', 'believe', 'innocence', 'good', 'episode', 'unfortunately', 'suffers', 'fact', 'same', 'chain', 'events', 'least', 'five', 'times', 'five', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'result', 'episode', 'rather', 'slow', 'times', 'still', 'good', 'moments', 'it.So', 'end', 'result', 'volume', 'Farscape', 'Season', '2', 'two', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'episodes', 'different', 'reasons', 'Beware', 'Dog', 'Locket', 'episode', 'good', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Just', 'skip', 'over', 'Wo', ""n't"", 'Get', 'Fooled', 'Again', 'when', 'watch', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']","Farscape: Season 2, Vol. 4"

I'm kind of shocked that other reviewers are dishing five stars so liberally. I thought these were all pretty boring. These (4) stories have potential at times and do manage to tickle you with an oddity here and there, humor as well, but it's too slow and a little lacking in the entertainment vector (and I really hate Dargo's new 'softer side'). Shamefully, I admit the primary reason I don't like these episodes is the lack of space scenery or battles. Not many special effects and locations are a little average and low budge. As always of course, the animatronics are top notch. Reviewers really seem to be taken with these 4 episodes though, so maybe it's just me.",2,quirky,1040601600,"12 23, 2002",2002,779,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'farscape', 'pick', 'up', 'season', 'alone', 'apparently', 'only', 'gotten', 'worse', ""'m"", 'kind', 'shocked', 'other', 'reviewers', 'are', 'dishing', 'five', 'stars', 'so', 'liberally', 'thought', 'were', 'pretty', 'boring', '4', 'stories', 'have', 'potential', 'times', 'do', 'manage', 'tickle', 'oddity', 'here', 'there', 'humor', 'as', 'well', 'too', 'slow', 'little', 'lacking', 'entertainment', 'vector', 'really', 'hate', 'Dargo', 'new', ""'softer"", 'side', 'Shamefully', 'admit', 'primary', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'episodes', 'lack', 'space', 'scenery', 'battles', 'Not', 'many', 'special', 'effects', 'locations', 'are', 'little', 'average', 'low', 'budge', 'always', 'course', 'animatronics', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'Reviewers', 'really', 'seem', 'be', 'taken', '4', 'episodes', 'maybe', 'just']","Farscape: Season 2, Vol. 4"
712376,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00006CY4L,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[4, 4]","If you're reading this you're probably a long time fan of this cancelled series or a new raw recruit. There are a number of negative reviews about some of the episodes contained on this disc. I'm not exactly sure why. Clearly the folks were expecting something else--something they had seen before perhaps.Defying that very expectation is what made Farscape special. Yes, Beware of Dog isn't as earthshaking as the cliff hanger of the previous season (or even the three part episode set on &quot;Royal World&quot; as Crichton humorously calls it). It's meant to be Farscape's Trouble with Tribbles with a much darker, edgier tone. You'll either love or hate the tone of this fine episode as it indulges in a bit more humor than the average episode. Star Trek: TNG vet Naren Shanker's script plays with our perceptions of the characters. There's a witty line of dialog that references Aliens (having Chiana say it was an inspired touch. There's also a number of humorous visual references to E.T. and a tip of the hat to Joe Dante's Gremlins)Won't Get Fooled Again is a marevlous episode that plays with both audience expectations, Crichton's previous experience with a simulation of a return trip home and the essence of the show's regular characters. It also reveals important information about why Scorpi keeps showing up in Crichton's wakeful &quot;dreams&quot;. It's another way for Scorpi to be in the script, interacting with Crichton even in the setting of Moya. It's marvelously paced and Ben Browder gives a superb performance (as do all the actors playing against character &quot;type&quot;)as a man losing his mind. Kudos to writer Richard Manning for pulling off an episode that, essentially, revisits theme from the previous season and Rowan Woods' surreal directorial touches (the red pumps on Crais is a marvelous touch).The Locket focuses on the outcome of Crichton's infatuation with Aryn. It's a great &quot;what if&quot; episode that, again, defies expectations. It's a heartfelt episode that focuses on character and the various character's expectations of each other. Writer Justin Monjo's script and Ian Watson's direction are both top-notch.The Ugly Truth could have been a routine episode. By dint of the performances, direction and writing it overcomes many of the limitations of the basic premise. The dialog by first time Farscape writers Gabrielle Stanton and Harry Werksman, Jr. has some sparkling dialog and character moments. The opticals exceed expectations in what could have been a simple &quot;bottle&quot; episode.This quartet of episodes are among the best the second season had to offer. The next boxset will focus on a strong trio of episodes that unfold what Scorpi really did to Crichton and the disasterous outcome of his shipmates attempt to save him.The transfer is top notch with little or no analog or digital artifacts. While the entire series has looked really good, it's clear that ADV has hit their stride with the second season set. I did notice some analog artifacts on the previous set but it wasn't a huge distraction. There's no such problems that I can see here. The extras include deleted scenes, conceptual artwork, a biography of Anthony Simcoe as well as a backstory on D'Argo. There's also the first part of a text/visual driven look at the various alien species.The sound is, for the most part, exceptional (except for some of the deleted scenes where it's clear that it came from a broadcast episode probably created for a foreign market with no stereo or 5.1 sound available).While I did have problems with some of the science in some of the previous episodes (Crichton's escape in one episode was engineered by decompressing into space and using a gun to propel himself to another craft. While it's possible, the amount of time Crichton was in space could have killed him. He didn't look any worse for the wear. It's a nice little tribute to a similar scene in 2001 though).",5,"Pip, it's time for a reality check",1043280000,"01 23, 2003",2003,3939,"[""'re"", 'reading', ""'re"", 'probably', 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'cancelled', 'series', 'new', 'raw', 'recruit', 'are', 'number', 'negative', 'reviews', 'episodes', 'contained', 'disc', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'why', 'Clearly', 'folks', 'were', 'expecting', 'something', 'else', 'something', 'had', 'seen', 'perhaps.Defying', 'very', 'expectation', 'what', 'made', 'Farscape', 'special', 'Yes', 'Beware', 'Dog', ""n't"", 'as', 'earthshaking', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'previous', 'season', 'even', 'three', 'part', 'episode', 'set', 'quot', 'Royal', 'World', 'quot', 'Crichton', 'humorously', 'meant', 'be', 'Farscape', 'Trouble', 'Tribbles', 'much', 'darker', 'edgier', 'tone', ""'ll"", 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'tone', 'fine', 'episode', 'bit', 'more', 'humor', 'average', 'episode', 'Star', 'Trek', 'TNG', 'vet', 'Naren', 'Shanker', 'script', 'perceptions', 'characters', 'witty', 'line', 'dialog', 'references', 'Aliens', 'having', 'Chiana', 'say', 'was', 'inspired', 'touch', 'also', 'number', 'humorous', 'visual', 'references', 'E.T', 'tip', 'hat', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'Gremlins', 'Wo', ""n't"", 'Get', 'Fooled', 'Again', 'marevlous', 'episode', 'audience', 'expectations', 'Crichton', 'previous', 'experience', 'simulation', 'return', 'trip', 'home', 'essence', 'show', 'regular', 'characters', 'also', 'important', 'information', 'why', 'Scorpi', 'showing', 'up', 'Crichton', 'wakeful', 'quot', 'quot', 'way', 'Scorpi', 'be', 'script', 'interacting', 'Crichton', 'even', 'setting', 'Moya', 'marvelously', 'paced', 'Ben', 'Browder', 'superb', 'performance', 'do', 'actors', 'playing', 'character', 'quot', 'quot', 'man', 'losing', 'mind', 'Kudos', 'writer', 'Richard', 'Manning', 'pulling', 'off', 'episode', 'essentially', 'revisits', 'theme', 'previous', 'season', 'Rowan', 'Woods', 'surreal', 'directorial', 'touches', 'red', 'pumps', 'Crais', 'marvelous', 'touch', '.The', 'Locket', 'outcome', 'Crichton', 'infatuation', 'Aryn', 'great', 'quot', 'what', 'quot', 'again', 'defies', 'expectations', 'heartfelt', 'episode', 'character', 'various', 'character', 'expectations', 'other', 'Writer', 'Justin', 'Monjo', 'script', 'Ian', 'Watson', 'direction', 'are', 'top-notch.The', 'Ugly', 'Truth', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'routine', 'episode', 'dint', 'performances', 'direction', 'writing', 'many', 'limitations', 'basic', 'premise', 'dialog', 'first', 'time', 'Farscape', 'writers', 'Gabrielle', 'Stanton', 'Harry', 'Werksman', 'Jr.', 'sparkling', 'dialog', 'character', 'moments', 'opticals', 'exceed', 'expectations', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'simple', 'quot', 'quot', 'quartet', 'episodes', 'are', 'best', 'second', 'season', 'had', 'offer', 'next', 'boxset', 'will', 'focus', 'strong', 'trio', 'episodes', 'unfold', 'what', 'Scorpi', 'really', 'did', 'Crichton', 'disasterous', 'outcome', 'shipmates', 'attempt', 'save', 'him.The', 'transfer', 'top', 'notch', 'little', 'analog', 'digital', 'artifacts', 'entire', 'series', 'looked', 'really', 'good', 'clear', 'ADV', 'hit', 'stride', 'second', 'season', 'set', 'did', 'notice', 'analog', 'artifacts', 'previous', 'set', 'was', ""n't"", 'huge', 'distraction', 'such', 'problems', 'can', 'see', 'here', 'extras', 'include', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'conceptual', 'artwork', 'biography', 'Anthony', 'Simcoe', 'as', 'well', 'backstory', ""D'Argo"", 'also', 'first', 'part', 'text/visual', 'driven', 'look', 'various', 'alien', 'species.The', 'sound', 'most', 'part', 'exceptional', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'where', 'clear', 'came', 'broadcast', 'episode', 'probably', 'created', 'foreign', 'market', 'stereo', '5.1', 'sound', 'available', 'did', 'have', 'problems', 'science', 'previous', 'episodes', 'Crichton', 'escape', 'one', 'episode', 'was', 'engineered', 'decompressing', 'space', 'using', 'gun', 'propel', 'craft', 'possible', 'amount', 'time', 'Crichton', 'was', 'space', 'could', 'have', 'killed', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'worse', 'wear', 'nice', 'little', 'tribute', 'similar', 'scene', '2001']","Farscape: Season 2, Vol. 4"
