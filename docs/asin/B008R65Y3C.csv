These are such fun movies and it was less expensive to buy them this way than on individual DVDs.If you're thinking that the other two movies will be on a par with these, well, you're going to be disappointed.  The other two are -- well, let me speak plainly -- duds.  Diane Keaton should erase Because I Said So from her resume.  And Definitely, Maybe is pretty low-standard, too.But for fans of Love Actually and Notting Hill, this is a good buy.
