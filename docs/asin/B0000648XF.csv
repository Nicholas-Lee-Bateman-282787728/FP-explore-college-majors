I don't know whether I like this role or his role in Pulp Fiction better.  There are several classic lines in this movie, some of which I can't repeat in this review.  My favorite line is, &#34;There have been many Champions to enter the ring, but only one King.&#34;  Buy this movie now.

If you are in the game of promotions its a must have especially if you are a minority or Jewish. It shows what real hustle is all about. Sure many people have a lot of negative opinions of the King but check most people don't really know his story. At the end of the day what i came away with this movie is that you have to fight for what you want it will not be handed out freely. When you have to compete with people with more money and education amongst other things they not playing fair and when you play by their rules you are the bad guy. Don King just mastered the game the created and he beat them at it by any means necessary and i for one am not mad at him. If he had not been to aggressive  we would know about Don King because they would not have cut him in. The man is no saint but he ain't the devil either he is human. This movie shows the affects of what hard work and success does to a human being- It can make you hard. I loved this movie the casting is great!!! SUPERB. Darius and Ving did a hell of a job!! so did Bernie Mac... I actually thought Darius was more believable then Will Smith ( will was not bad just that Darius captured Ali better).

You may feel a little sympathy for a pathetic character like that, but that person is not worthy of respect. Is it now tolerable to lie, cheat, rob and steal from another person? Is it okay to ruin the lives and careers of others for selfish purposes? All because someone is charismatic and personable? What is it all coming to? Pros: Ving did an awesome job of portraying DK.

I like fight movies even if I don't like the reality of it. Weird huh? Ving Rhames was wonderful as Don King. I can understand why he won a Golden Globe award (which he gave to Jack Lemmon). Don King wouldn't have been so gracious. He was arrogant, mean (he killed a guy, beat him to death), racist (but a reason comes up in the film) and generally unlikeable. But Ving made him three dimensional in such a way that I admired King. He's smart and savvy (even if he does butcher the English language). He has a lot of spunk and drive. If he could have been honest with himself and others, no telling what he could have accomplished.This movie has great moments. My favorite was when he was selling the idea of helping him get Mohammad Ali to participate in a fundraiser for a Black hospital. He was caught by a preacher and his wife using the MF bomb.
