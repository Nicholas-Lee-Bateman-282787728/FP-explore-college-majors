So I was apprehensive to buy the DVD and watch the movie (this movie was on TV before I was born).  Usually the movie isn't as good as the book but I found this movie almost as good as the book.  I would defiantly recommend it.  Even just in a historical way.  I also wanted to get Queen on DVD.  Was very disappointed that Queen wasn't out on DVD yet.  So I researched it and it looks like it's coming out on 01/15/08 (deepdiscount.com).  So hopefully that date is correct because I'm looking forward to watching Queen (Halle Berry).,5,Roots Great Movie/ Queen On DVD,1192752000,"10 19, 2007",2007,576,"['Read', 'Alex', 'Haley', 'books', 'Roots', 'Queen', 'So', 'was', 'apprehensive', 'buy', 'DVD', 'watch', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'TV', 'was', 'born', 'Usually', 'movie', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'book', 'found', 'movie', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'book', 'would', 'defiantly', 'recommend', 'Even', 'just', 'historical', 'way', 'also', 'wanted', 'get', 'Queen', 'DVD', 'Was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'Queen', 'was', ""n't"", 'out', 'DVD', 'yet', 'researched', 'coming', 'out', '01/15/08', 'deepdiscount.com', 'hopefully', 'date', 'correct', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'Queen', 'Halle', 'Berry']",N/A
320985,A215DZNW9403IG,6302571251,"Amazon Customer ""Carlos""","[260, 273]","This show aired for the first time when I was 8. I have to say I didn't watch it -but heard a lot about it-, so when I heard it was coming out on DVD, I take a chance and ordered it.It's no wonder this show was the most watched in history. I have to say I'm not American, therefore the history itself isn't my history. Still, I felt totally touched by the series, and had to make an effort after each episode not to watch the next inmediately and go to bed. In my opinion, this is not a story for blacks, or Americans. This is a great story -whether you want to watch is as history or fiction, if makes you feel better somehow- that everyone will enjoy.Anyway, most likely you already know what roots it's about. If you don't, well, it's the story of seven generations of a black family, from the capture in Africa of a free black (Kunta Kinte) to become a slave, to the writer of the book (Alex Haley) himself.Actually note that the DVDs tell the story from Kunta Kinte until the generation where they become free, then explains in the final minutes happened to the rest. The story is told complete in Roots: The Next Generations, which isn't available on DVD yet.I will comment on the DVD now. The box comes with three double sided DVDs (which I don't like, because I think they are more prone to be damaged). Total running time is 573 minutes. Region is 1. The primary track (English) is closed captioned, and there are subtitles in English, Spanish and French. Note that the additional commentary is not subtitled, so if you are impaired you will miss it.Sound is in mono both in the English and the Spanish tracks (dolby digital, though) and is very decent.Video is 4:3, and it's quite clean. It's interlaced (if you care about this because you use your PC to watch DVDs).As for the box itself, it's convinient and doesn't take a lot of shelf space, which I appreciate very much.There are no booklets included.",5,Must-have TV show,1018051200,"04 6, 2002",2002,1915,"['show', 'aired', 'first', 'time', 'when', 'was', '8', 'have', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', '-but', 'heard', 'lot', 'it-', 'when', 'heard', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'DVD', 'take', 'chance', 'ordered', 'it.It', 'wonder', 'show', 'was', 'most', 'watched', 'history', 'have', 'say', ""'m"", 'not', 'American', 'therefore', 'history', ""n't"", 'history', 'Still', 'felt', 'totally', 'touched', 'series', 'had', 'make', 'effort', 'episode', 'not', 'watch', 'next', 'inmediately', 'go', 'bed', 'opinion', 'not', 'story', 'blacks', 'Americans', 'great', 'story', '-whether', 'want', 'watch', 'history', 'fiction', 'feel', 'better', 'somehow-', 'everyone', 'will', 'enjoy.Anyway', 'most', 'likely', 'already', 'know', 'what', 'about', 'do', ""n't"", 'well', 'story', 'seven', 'generations', 'black', 'family', 'capture', 'Africa', 'free', 'black', 'Kunta', 'Kinte', 'become', 'slave', 'writer', 'book', 'Alex', 'Haley', 'himself.Actually', 'note', 'DVDs', 'tell', 'story', 'Kunta', 'Kinte', 'generation', 'where', 'become', 'free', 'then', 'final', 'minutes', 'happened', 'rest', 'story', 'told', 'complete', 'Roots', 'Next', 'Generations', ""n't"", 'available', 'DVD', 'yet.I', 'will', 'comment', 'DVD', 'now', 'box', 'three', 'double', 'sided', 'DVDs', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'think', 'are', 'more', 'prone', 'be', 'damaged', 'Total', 'running', 'time', '573', 'minutes', 'Region', '1', 'primary', 'track', 'English', 'closed', 'captioned', 'are', 'subtitles', 'English', 'Spanish', 'French', 'Note', 'additional', 'commentary', 'not', 'subtitled', 'so', 'are', 'impaired', 'will', 'miss', 'it.Sound', 'mono', 'English', 'Spanish', 'tracks', 'dolby', 'digital', 'very', 'decent.Video', '4:3', 'quite', 'clean', 'interlaced', 'care', 'use', 'PC', 'watch', 'DVDs', '.As', 'box', 'convinient', ""n't"", 'take', 'lot', 'shelf', 'space', 'appreciate', 'very', 'much.There', 'are', 'booklets', 'included']",N/A
320986,A2B92GI9EFIGFY,6302571251,"Amber McCann ""Future Author""","[27, 34]","Roots...I first was introduced to the miniseries in the 8th grade. I was instantly hit by it, in a good way. I only saw 45 minutes of the almost 7-8 hour movie, I fell in love with it. Just recently, a Roots Marathon came on the television and I watched the entire thing. From Kunte Kinte to Chicken George and his long-lineage of friends and family finally be freed from their &quot;taxes&quot; and have their land to themselves. My eyes were filled with tears from the moment the movie began and until the movie ended. Roots is a spectacular movie. The acting is wonderful. However the powerful moments comes in personal introspection. When one realizes how dehumanizing and how completely wrong, for lack of better word, it is to subject any person to slavery based on some outer physical characteristic...it is absurd. My heart still is reaching out to all the African-Americans who endured slavery and the post-effects of slavery continuing up to this day. Roots allows us to see the pitfalls of the &quot;land of the free...all men are created equal&quot;...how dare the United States make that assumption. Roots shows us that we still have a long way to go before all men are created equal.

So on with the DVD itself.Overall, the DVD is fairly accurate in dealing with slavery and African issues (it might help to clarify that while many Africans were Muslims before the transatlantic slave trade, most were still into African religions and it's important to mention HOW htey became Muslims). But in either case, it's good for a basic understanding of these concepts and the effect of salvery on Blacks and Whites.When this came out during my Middle School years in 1977, knuckle-headed bullies (regardless of race) caused riots and fights that rocked integrated schools in much of the country over what they saw in ROOTS. This did not have to be and today, I think this shows why children need to be taught about this history in school before they react in that fashion unecessarily, as it misses the point.On the positive side, the series DID encourage people to actually LEARN about history and STUDY their own familiy histories. It also opened up communication between young people and their elders. Such people ""got the point"" of ROOTS.A lot of interesting scenes in the book (such as Kunta's reaction to his wife and daughter's Baptism) didn't make the film. But that's okay, as the book is easily available and the film is so well-paced that it keeps you in suspense and wanting to know what happens next.Now if the price goes down-I'll REALLY be a happy man over this.",5,Words cannot express--,1124323200,"08 18, 2005",2005,1434,"['Okay', ""'re"", 'site', 'know', 'story', 'So', 'DVD', 'itself.Overall', 'DVD', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'dealing', 'slavery', 'African', 'issues', 'might', 'help', 'clarify', 'many', 'Africans', 'were', 'Muslims', 'transatlantic', 'slave', 'trade', 'most', 'were', 'still', 'African', 'religions', 'important', 'mention', 'HOW', 'htey', 'became', 'Muslims', 'case', 'good', 'basic', 'understanding', 'concepts', 'effect', 'salvery', 'Blacks', 'Whites.When', 'came', 'out', 'Middle', 'School', 'years', '1977', 'knuckle-headed', 'bullies', 'regardless', 'race', 'caused', 'riots', 'fights', 'rocked', 'integrated', 'schools', 'much', 'country', 'over', 'what', 'saw', 'ROOTS', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'today', 'think', 'why', 'children', 'need', 'be', 'taught', 'history', 'school', 'react', 'fashion', 'unecessarily', 'point.On', 'positive', 'side', 'series', 'DID', 'encourage', 'people', 'actually', 'LEARN', 'history', 'STUDY', 'own', 'familiy', 'histories', 'also', 'opened', 'up', 'communication', 'young', 'people', 'elders', 'Such', 'people', 'got', 'point', 'ROOTS.A', 'lot', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'book', 'such', 'Kunta', 'reaction', 'wife', 'daughter', 'Baptism', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'okay', 'book', 'easily', 'available', 'film', 'so', 'well-paced', 'suspense', 'wanting', 'know', 'what', 'next.Now', 'price', 'down-I', ""'ll"", 'REALLY', 'be', 'happy', 'man']",N/A

They also did a good job with the commentary, which covered all six episodes.The actual story was another matter. There were some great performances (especially by Louis Gossett Jr. as Fiddler), but there were a few I could have done without, like Sandy Duncan and whoever played that poor white guy starting with episode five. They featured too many unbelievable coincidences, which means lazy writing to me. The show also looked claustrophobic after episode one , no doubt because of budget constraints. (That  snow in episode two looked like the result of an overflowing washing machine.)It looked like they were in one spot for the remaining five episodes.

This is a chance to own a small, but intensely significant piece of history that you can share with your children, parents, friends and anyone else.ROOTS chronicals the 7 generations of author Alex Hailey's family, beginning with Kunta Kente, a free young man of 15 living in The Gambia, Africa with his mother and father.  And just one short day after his manhood training, he goes to find a log to make a drum for his little brother and is captured by the slave hunters.  He is then taken to America, where he is sold into slavery.Kunta Kente is a strong warrior who NEVER gives up his quest for the freedom he knew in Africa.  And though he is beaten to within an inch of his life several times and even has his right foot cut off, he never stops trying.  His strength and courage and legacy is passed on to his daughter, Kizzy, who passes it on to her son Chicken George, who passes it on to his son Tom, and finally, Tom's granddaughter passes it on to her son, Alex Haley.This is a TRUE tale of the utmost strength, surrounded by what is the REAL American History.  Not soft-soaped too much.  Just gritty and raw reality.

It is virtually impossible to watch it without stirring feelings of fear, anger, sadness, and bitterness. You may even find yourself squirming in your seat at times. I also found it interesting that Ralph Waite and Robert Reed (aka Mr. Walton and Mr. Brady) who I had become accustom to seeing in kind and gentle fatherly roles portraying evil and cruel men in Roots. This in itself took a little getting used to but was nice to see both of these talented actors demonstrate their wide range of acting abilities. This movie had such an effect on me that I had to fast forward through a few of the scenes that demonstrated just how cruel masters and overseers could be when punishing or even &quot;motivating&quot; their slaves. I for the life of me can never and will NEVER understand how one human being could demonstrate such cruelty to another human being, even if they were a slave. I would never think of treating an animal or even an insect the way many of the slaves were treated in Roots. And the kicker is many of these slave owners and ship captains considered themselves to be Christian, God-fearing men. I suppose they slept through the part of the sermon that said &quot;love thy neighbor&quot; and &quot;treat others as you'd like to be treated&quot;, etc. It's even sadder to think that many of these attitudes still exist today in the form of racism.

321028,A3EHIGO4FNILXP,6302571251,.fgd,"[0, 1]","I found the first 3 episodes of Roots exhausting to watch because they were so moving. Outside of one Italian Realism film, movies do not bring tears to my eyes. But my eyes kept watering throughout and a couple of times I actually bawled for a couple of minutes,  like them folks were my ancestors too and I'm white! !!!Kunte-Kinte as man and boy, Fiddler, Kunte's mother and grand-mother and Kunte's wife.All these actors put in phenomenal performances. More than that,  they pull on (and actually mention in the commentary) on racial memory. I don't give credence to reincarnation or dead people whispering or watching over the living but after Roots I now think racial memory can exist in the collective unconscious, as Jung calls it. Outside of being actors- all these people had/have alot of substance and quality and stature; old souls even........I'm bowled over and it is unforgetable.OK, here's the disgusting nose-dive in episode 4. : Kunte bears a daughter; he has even sacrificed his possible freedom for her. But she is ""white! !!"" Her parents are black as coal but her skin is as pale as can be for a black , including  her possibly white nose and lips. She is sprung upon the screen at the very start of episode 4 , looking very eager, yet she pricked the balloon and momentum of previous episodes. Especially evident was the depleted acting or presence-stature of the previous generations. Worse- as Kizzy ages she grows an elongated somewhat pointy nose.And with the strange green pancake make-up to age her , or darken her skin, she starts to look like the witch of the West.In the commentary, the directors and producer's talk with alot of pride about the control they had over production. Even that Alex Haley,  the author, was keeping close-tabs on production and that they had casted to avoid people with contempory looks. Yet the film becomes infected with what I call Monster Ball syndrome, which is a Billy Bob Thornton film, in more recent years, dealing with racial tensions. Billy Bob's girl-friend is supposed to be pore, black,southern woman. Definetely black, because he is defyng his father by dating her.Yet She is played by Halle Berry who looks, to me, like a white woman with black blood; even her hair-type. As Kizzy she has a narrow nose and lips.In the UK, growing up in the '70s, we called/ call mixed blood, half-caste. This term not only includes black people whohave white blood BUT gives credence to the idea of white people having black blood, which seems evasive in The States. It created a show stopper like Kizzy. In effect, just when Roots had made a name for itself using black actors,  The Studios threw in a caucasion- black. It is subversion and theft on subliminal levels; full of denial and mis-uses the black label. That Chicken George, her son, is coal-black proves my theory. If  he had looked as white as Kizzy then the audience would have had to deal with his father being white and that Chicken George is as much a white man with black blood. There is no running from it after many scenes with his white father.Even Matilda is pale but at least has black features.Whatever the appeasements going on,Kizzy and Tom's wife should have been driving, supportive roles  with real acting skills and presence to match and enhance the two male leads. Until those two women die off, the series does not pick up steam again until series 6,the last one, when the screen- play improves and Tom brings integrity back with a subdued but steady, thoughtful strength, exploring racial tensions after abolition.There is footage,at the end,  of a charismatic Alex Haley giving an epilogue with family photos, which is a rewarding touch.",3,phenomenal performances that take a deep nose-dive by episode 4,1362787200,"03 9, 2013",2013,3679,"['found', 'first', '3', 'episodes', 'Roots', 'exhausting', 'watch', 'were', 'so', 'moving', 'one', 'Italian', 'Realism', 'film', 'movies', 'do', 'not', 'bring', 'tears', 'eyes', 'eyes', 'kept', 'watering', 'couple', 'times', 'actually', 'bawled', 'couple', 'minutes', 'folks', 'were', 'ancestors', 'too', ""'m"", 'white', 'Kunte-Kinte', 'man', 'boy', 'Fiddler', 'Kunte', 'mother', 'grand-mother', 'Kunte', 'wife.All', 'actors', 'put', 'phenomenal', 'performances', 'More', 'pull', 'actually', 'mention', 'commentary', 'racial', 'memory', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'credence', 'reincarnation', 'dead', 'people', 'whispering', 'watching', 'living', 'Roots', 'now', 'think', 'racial', 'memory', 'can', 'exist', 'collective', 'unconscious', 'Jung', 'being', 'actors-', 'people', 'had/have', 'alot', 'substance', 'quality', 'stature', 'old', 'souls', 'even', ""'m"", 'bowled', 'unforgetable.OK', 'here', 'disgusting', 'nose-dive', 'episode', '4.', 'Kunte', 'daughter', 'even', 'sacrificed', 'possible', 'freedom', 'white', 'parents', 'are', 'black', 'coal', 'skin', 'as', 'pale', 'can', 'be', 'black', 'including', 'possibly', 'white', 'nose', 'lips', 'sprung', 'screen', 'very', 'start', 'episode', '4', 'looking', 'very', 'eager', 'yet', 'pricked', 'balloon', 'momentum', 'previous', 'episodes', 'Especially', 'evident', 'was', 'depleted', 'acting', 'presence-stature', 'previous', 'generations', 'Worse-', 'Kizzy', 'elongated', 'somewhat', 'pointy', 'nose.And', 'strange', 'green', 'pancake', 'make-up', 'age', 'darken', 'skin', 'look', 'witch', 'West.In', 'commentary', 'directors', 'producer', 'talk', 'alot', 'pride', 'control', 'had', 'production', 'Even', 'Alex', 'Haley', 'author', 'was', 'keeping', 'close-tabs', 'production', 'had', 'casted', 'avoid', 'people', 'contempory', 'looks', 'film', 'infected', 'what', 'call', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'syndrome', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'film', 'more', 'recent', 'years', 'dealing', 'racial', 'tensions', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'girl-friend', 'supposed', 'be', 'pore', 'black', 'southern', 'woman', 'Definetely', 'black', 'defyng', 'father', 'dating', 'her.Yet', 'played', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'who', 'white', 'woman', 'black', 'blood', 'even', 'hair-type', 'Kizzy', 'narrow', 'nose', 'UK', 'growing', 'up', ""'70s"", 'called/', 'call', 'mixed', 'blood', 'half-caste', 'term', 'not', 'only', 'black', 'people', 'whohave', 'white', 'blood', 'BUT', 'credence', 'idea', 'white', 'people', 'having', 'black', 'blood', 'evasive', 'States', 'created', 'show', 'stopper', 'Kizzy', 'effect', 'just', 'when', 'Roots', 'had', 'made', 'name', 'using', 'black', 'actors', 'Studios', 'threw', 'caucasion-', 'black', 'subversion', 'theft', 'subliminal', 'levels', 'full', 'denial', 'black', 'label', 'Chicken', 'George', 'son', 'coal-black', 'proves', 'theory', 'had', 'looked', 'as', 'white', 'Kizzy', 'then', 'audience', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'deal', 'father', 'being', 'white', 'Chicken', 'George', 'as', 'much', 'white', 'man', 'black', 'blood', 'running', 'many', 'scenes', 'white', 'father.Even', 'Matilda', 'pale', 'least', 'black', 'appeasements', 'going', 'Kizzy', 'Tom', 'wife', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'driving', 'supportive', 'roles', 'real', 'acting', 'skills', 'presence', 'match', 'enhance', 'two', 'male', 'leads', 'two', 'women', 'die', 'off', 'series', 'not', 'pick', 'up', 'steam', 'again', 'series', '6', 'last', 'one', 'when', 'screen-', 'play', 'improves', 'Tom', 'integrity', 'back', 'subdued', 'steady', 'thoughtful', 'strength', 'exploring', 'racial', 'tensions', 'footage', 'end', 'charismatic', 'Alex', 'Haley', 'giving', 'epilogue', 'family', 'photos', 'rewarding', 'touch']",N/A

Ed Asner is remarkable as thereligious captain of a slave ship whose conscious eats him alive for commiting such an evil sin.Even Kunta gets a slave name and tries to revolt fighting such politically incorrent blacks like Fiddler onlyto realize the situation is hopeless and to top it he learns a love of his is raped by a piece of white trash named Tom Moore. Eventually after Kunta's story comes the next generation of Roots taking place around the Civil War, blacks are free in the North but the same old story continues in the south ,although now blacks are now beginnging to fight back.The DVD's are great, Levar Burton provides visual commentary on the episodes.

321038,A1WN7Y941KA2SS,6302571251,His Beat Goes On...,"[2, 5]","I was a month short of 9 years of age when Roots was first broadcast on TV.  Til only recently I had never ever seen it.  I heard a lot about it but never actually sat down to watch it.  I was recently at our town library and decided to take volume 1 home.  I was somewhat excited about it as I sat down to watch.In the first volume I found the idealization of Kunta Kinte's tribe  and, except for the Ed Asner character, most white characters were 1 dimensional, to be a little too difficult to swallow.However I continue to watch.In the subsequent volumes as Kunta grew up, married and raised Kizzy, the writing of the  characters began to show some depth.  Frankly in those episodes I was pleased that not all white people were evil masochists.  I liked Robert Reed's character.  He was fair, deep and introspective.  Even when he sold Kizzy away it was not done for no reason.The final volume was where I started to feel like I was watching a cartoon again.  I thought the Lloyd Bridges character had little depth and was completely onedimensional .  His character's relationship with Tom was the most one dimensional relationship in the whole series in my opinion.  I found other slave owners and white characters like Mr.Ames,  Tom Moore and even John and William Reynolds having multi-dimensional , more realistic relationships with their slaves.  This helped draw me in to the miniseries - of course until the end when all the white people were eitherwimps (George Johnson), overt racists (Evan Brent(Bridges)) or corrupt Senators (Burl Ives' character).I was deeply moved by the plight of the slaves, especially Kizzy.  When she visited her father's grave and all that was written on it was ""TOBY"", I was profoundly affected.  I was affected primarily because I felt like I knew Kunta from his youth and how he was a valued human being as a young person only to end up in a grave with a cheap stone scrawled with ""TOBY"".  It was a very powerful moment when Kizzy wrote ""Kunta Kinte"" on the stone.There are two things apart from the specifics with certain characters that I would have done differently in making this mini-series.  First I would have had the people in Africa speak a native African tongue with subtitles (a la The Passion of the Christ and Apocalypto).  This would have made it more believable especially when Kunta comes to the US and suddenly can't speak or understand English.  Yes as I watched it I could get beyond that and make pretend he wasn't speaking English when he was in Africa,  but it would have been better if they spoke their native language in Africa.The second thing is as a Christian, I would like to have seen someone introduce Christianity to Kunta and at some point give his life to Christ or at least see one of his progeny do it.I highly recommend this mini-series to anyone.

321039,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,6302571251,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 2]","This TV mini-series has become a classic in some twenty or thirty years and it deserves to be, both in its first part and in its second part. Yet the quality of the filming and editing has aged and the film is not served by the fact it was done for television that tends to show  too many close-ups and to avoid vast  rapid movements and wide landscapes. But it has become a classic by the theme it deals with.The first mini series deals with the fate of black people from when they were captured in Africa to their liberation after the Civil War. The vision of Africa in the 18th century is slightly improved on what it was. Some rituals are nicely evoked but not shown, circumcision for example, and nothing is said about excision for the girls. The capturing of Bantu blacks in western Africa and their enslaving had been going on for centuries. The new thing is that the captured Bantu blacks were no longer sold as slaves to the northern Moslem tribes or even Moslem Maghreb people, but to the whites for only one reason: the whites paid better and more. This is not done out of decency. It seems to be done in order to avoid any rejection for the family public, any restrictive rating. It is the same thing with the whole period about slavery. The film concentrates on odious facts but all together rather limited facts: one whipping, a couple of children sold, very few rapes by the whites in order to produce mulattos that could be sold for a profit. The hardships of field work are also curbed a lot. The living conditions and quarters were quite luxurious when we know what it really was. Even the Civil War is shown with a lot of reserve. They may say the number of dead but they don't show the battles, the medical care of the wounded, the savagery of the war itself and the innumerable amputees and other victims after the war. Altogether the first part is rather tamed. That of course enhances the main theme of this first part, and also of the second part, the fact that one has to retain the memory of one's origins, roots, past, even if it is only a name, a few words, a few episodes. It is those recollections passed from one generation to the next that feed and strengthen the sense of belonging, the hope that will bring the future out of the present, the light that may one day illuminate the dull and dark present. One day at a time but always with the past in the conscious background. And the joy of the liberation is important, but the first part ends on a closure too: the whites are still there and the blacks have to live with them and compromises are not always easy to find and not always to the real benefit of the blacks. Slavery is replaced by sharecropping but what's the difference when the black sharecroppers start with the debts that are attributed to them to pay for what they need to work and they should get free since they worked for nothing for decades. That's how it works with the whites in the South, and yet the family we are speaking of managed to finagle a plan to get the mules free and to move out without paying for the debts of slavery from North Carolina to Tennessee where one freed member who got the chance to make some wealth in England had bought some land. That's the real freedom this family achieves after the Civil war: to possess the land they till and thus the harvest they grow.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID",5,Effective and reserved,1285804800,"09 30, 2010",2010,3478,"['TV', 'mini-series', 'become', 'classic', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'years', 'be', 'first', 'part', 'second', 'part', 'quality', 'filming', 'editing', 'aged', 'film', 'not', 'served', 'fact', 'was', 'done', 'television', 'show', 'too', 'many', 'close-ups', 'avoid', 'vast', 'rapid', 'movements', 'wide', 'landscapes', 'become', 'classic', 'theme', 'with.The', 'first', 'mini', 'series', 'deals', 'fate', 'black', 'people', 'when', 'were', 'captured', 'Africa', 'liberation', 'Civil', 'War', 'vision', 'Africa', '18th', 'century', 'slightly', 'improved', 'what', 'was', 'rituals', 'are', 'nicely', 'evoked', 'not', 'shown', 'circumcision', 'example', 'nothing', 'said', 'excision', 'girls', 'capturing', 'Bantu', 'blacks', 'western', 'Africa', 'enslaving', 'had', 'been', 'going', 'centuries', 'new', 'thing', 'captured', 'Bantu', 'blacks', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'sold', 'slaves', 'northern', 'Moslem', 'tribes', 'even', 'Moslem', 'Maghreb', 'people', 'whites', 'only', 'one', 'reason', 'whites', 'paid', 'better', 'more', 'not', 'done', 'decency', 'be', 'done', 'order', 'avoid', 'rejection', 'family', 'public', 'restrictive', 'rating', 'same', 'thing', 'whole', 'period', 'slavery', 'film', 'concentrates', 'odious', 'facts', 'together', 'rather', 'limited', 'facts', 'one', 'whipping', 'couple', 'children', 'sold', 'very', 'few', 'rapes', 'whites', 'order', 'produce', 'mulattos', 'could', 'be', 'sold', 'profit', 'hardships', 'field', 'work', 'are', 'also', 'curbed', 'lot', 'living', 'conditions', 'quarters', 'were', 'quite', 'luxurious', 'when', 'know', 'what', 'really', 'was', 'Even', 'Civil', 'War', 'shown', 'lot', 'reserve', 'may', 'say', 'number', 'dead', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'battles', 'medical', 'care', 'wounded', 'savagery', 'war', 'innumerable', 'amputees', 'other', 'victims', 'war', 'first', 'part', 'rather', 'tamed', 'course', 'main', 'theme', 'first', 'part', 'also', 'second', 'part', 'fact', 'one', 'retain', 'memory', 'one', 'origins', 'roots', 'past', 'even', 'only', 'name', 'few', 'words', 'few', 'episodes', 'recollections', 'passed', 'one', 'generation', 'next', 'feed', 'strengthen', 'sense', 'belonging', 'hope', 'will', 'bring', 'future', 'present', 'light', 'may', 'one', 'day', 'illuminate', 'dull', 'dark', 'present', 'One', 'day', 'time', 'always', 'past', 'conscious', 'background', 'joy', 'liberation', 'important', 'first', 'part', 'closure', 'too', 'whites', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'blacks', 'have', 'live', 'compromises', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'find', 'not', 'always', 'real', 'benefit', 'blacks', 'Slavery', 'replaced', 'sharecropping', 'what', 'difference', 'when', 'black', 'sharecroppers', 'start', 'debts', 'are', 'attributed', 'pay', 'what', 'need', 'work', 'should', 'get', 'free', 'worked', 'nothing', 'decades', 'how', 'whites', 'South', 'yet', 'family', 'are', 'speaking', 'managed', 'finagle', 'plan', 'get', 'mules', 'free', 'move', 'out', 'paying', 'debts', 'slavery', 'North', 'Carolina', 'Tennessee', 'where', 'one', 'freed', 'member', 'who', 'got', 'chance', 'make', 'wealth', 'England', 'had', 'bought', 'land', 'real', 'freedom', 'family', 'Civil', 'war', 'possess', 'land', 'till', 'thus', 'harvest', 'grow.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Paris', '8', 'Saint', 'Denis', 'University', 'Paris', '12', 'Cr', 'eacute', 'CEGID']",N/A

I watched it within a day and came away from it moved and intrigued. Roots is a true classic and one of my favorite books. The miniseries is the best program I have ever seen. Kunta was my favorite character in the book as well.Even though the young Kunta Kinte is only in the first two episodes, LeVar Burton is what made the show for me. Levar Burton is a revelation and it surprises me that he isn't doing more movies. He reminded me of those silent film stars who show with their eyes. The rest of the actors performed their characters just as well, and it gave me an impression of them playing their characters with the whole of their hearts. In this story Kunta is a good, brave young man who loves his village, his family and Allah. He is only 17 and has just completed manhood training and dreams of having a family of his own; the young warrior is out gathering food for his family when he hears a twig snap and turns to see a white man rushing him. Haley gets inside Kunta's mind and you feel his horror. Kunta fights bravely, he fights like a wild animal, but is overpowered and taken captive and then brutally abducted and put on a slave ship. Haley's book was so much more graphic; it showed scenes the TV show couldn't. To really grasp Kunta's nightmare, you need to read the book. The story eventually follows 200 yrs. of the descendants of this family who's strong will and striving finally brings them to Justice and Freedom.I think that different directors were assigned to different movies in the series... which could be the reason why movie began to grow weak after Kunta Kinte leaves the storyline. I thought the beginning was rather powerful... displaying the savagery of the white man's actions... entering the peaceful villages in Africa and pulling everybody out in shackles onto their ships' dark and musty cargo holds, and slowly, try to bring the main character into submission once he arrives in America. The rest is...Watchable... but has much less to offer than the first 2. This film is history, it has held up well over almost 30 years since it was originally televised. Racism is still rampant, and not just in the South. By being informed it helps each of us to have compassion and to inventory our beliefs and question our teachings.",5,Alex Haley's epic novel turns into a great mini series!,1166659200,"12 21, 2006",2006,2357,"['just', 'had', 'seen', 'Roots', 'saga', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', '1977', 'watched', 'day', 'came', 'away', 'moved', 'intrigued', 'Roots', 'true', 'classic', 'one', 'favorite', 'books', 'miniseries', 'best', 'program', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Kunta', 'was', 'favorite', 'character', 'book', 'well.Even', 'young', 'Kunta', 'Kinte', 'only', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'LeVar', 'Burton', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'Levar', 'Burton', 'revelation', ""n't"", 'doing', 'more', 'movies', 'reminded', 'silent', 'film', 'stars', 'who', 'show', 'eyes', 'rest', 'actors', 'performed', 'characters', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'gave', 'impression', 'playing', 'characters', 'whole', 'hearts', 'story', 'Kunta', 'good', 'brave', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'village', 'family', 'Allah', 'only', '17', 'just', 'completed', 'manhood', 'training', 'dreams', 'having', 'family', 'own', 'young', 'warrior', 'out', 'gathering', 'food', 'family', 'when', 'twig', 'snap', 'see', 'white', 'man', 'rushing', 'Haley', 'Kunta', 'mind', 'feel', 'horror', 'Kunta', 'fights', 'bravely', 'wild', 'animal', 'overpowered', 'taken', 'captive', 'then', 'brutally', 'abducted', 'put', 'slave', 'ship', 'Haley', 'book', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'graphic', 'showed', 'TV', 'show', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'grasp', 'Kunta', 'nightmare', 'need', 'read', 'book', 'story', 'eventually', '200', 'yrs', 'descendants', 'family', 'who', 'strong', 'will', 'striving', 'finally', 'Justice', 'Freedom.I', 'think', 'different', 'directors', 'were', 'assigned', 'different', 'movies', 'series', 'could', 'be', 'reason', 'why', 'movie', 'began', 'grow', 'weak', 'Kunta', 'Kinte', 'storyline', 'thought', 'beginning', 'was', 'rather', 'powerful', 'displaying', 'savagery', 'white', 'man', 'actions', 'entering', 'peaceful', 'villages', 'Africa', 'pulling', 'everybody', 'shackles', 'ships', 'dark', 'musty', 'cargo', 'slowly', 'try', 'bring', 'main', 'character', 'submission', 'once', 'America', 'rest', 'Watchable', 'much', 'less', 'offer', 'first', '2', 'film', 'history', 'held', 'up', 'well', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'was', 'originally', 'televised', 'Racism', 'still', 'rampant', 'not', 'just', 'South', 'being', 'informed', 'have', 'compassion', 'inventory', 'beliefs', 'question', 'teachings']",N/A

He, and apparently, others shouted a loud &#34;NO!!!!!&#34; when the ex-slave put down his whip and didn't feed his own bloodthirsty need for revenge against the whites. But, believe it or not, this ending actually still works despite the somewhat dated style of this epic mini-series; although the series is fairly &#34;white&#34; for such an edgy thematic approach to this subject matter (Haley himself apparently didn't want any black writers poisoning his words with their own ideas), &#34;Roots&#34; remains not only watchable now but also still fairly gripping. With an all-star celebrity cast, one might suspect this wheel of spinning stars to get annoying, and typical of TV's money-hungry aesthetic, but actually in many cases (nowadays) it keeps the film more interesting at times when looking back at all of these wonderful old actors. Despite my hesitation at labeling Haley a truly honest writer intellectually (he did have to pay Courlander for the material that was apparently lifted from his novel &#34;The African&#34;), I enjoyed the overall impact of this version of history--not always historically sound, not always dramatically incisive, but, always, very entertaining. The extras included on this disc are pretty good, including a discussion about the TV series from academic, political, and sociological ends. A nice feature for those of us who think historically rather than futuristically. I did not see this when it originally aired, nor did I own the old VHS tapes, so I can't say what was edited out or what wasn't. Nonetheless, I think the editing on these discs was fine in terms of tying loose ends together, but again I have no idea if anything was cut.The DVD had outstanding picture and sound quality, and I had no problem with any of the discs playing. Having sprung for the set and sat through the entire experience, I really did enjoy the whole thing. While the issue of slavery is always going to be the perpetual black mark that it is across the backs of all Americans, &#34;Roots&#34; went a little ways further in trying to examine the anger and outrage that sprang up from its hideous roots when considering the viewpoint of African Americans. But one needs to research colonialism a bit further if one wants to understand the intellectual and political conflicts that are really at work here. Overall, a nice introduction to get younger people (and maybe some stubborn adults) into the history of this problematic and still horrific period in American history.

The country practically came to a halt during that time slot every evening. Over 130 million views tuned in to watch this amazing story of Alex Haley's family's roots and history. It has been translated into 28 languages since. While the story and technology may seem a little outdated today (how can it not?), this is one story worth watching to gain a better understanding our country's history and where we have come from. In many ways it is the story of our nation from the days of slavery through the great struggles for freedom for all. Kunta Kinte is the main character who was captured and forced into slavery as a young man and brought to America. Perhaps the most poignant moment in the movie is where he has refused to give up his African name and be called Toby, the name his master has given him. He is beaten until, finally, he verbally says his name is Toby. While he may no longer be Kunta Kinte on the outside, he retains his African identity inside and longs to be free to be himself. He tries to pass that heritage down to the next generation. Although slavery obviously plays a major role in the story, it is first and foremost a story of family and what gets passed down from generation to generation. I understand the request for family records from archive sources skyrocketed after the series played. Haley spent over 12 years researching his family's roots before writing the best-selling book that was the basis for the movie. The movie rights were actually purchased before the book was finished and the screenplay was written and finished at the same time as the book. It is a 12 hour investment of your time but something you will not regret. You don't need to watch it all at once-spread it out. Get some friends together. Enjoy.

I receivedRoots (Four-Disc 30th Anniversary Edition)today (it was purchased 'New' from Amazon). My family won't be watching this tv miniseries for a couple months which will put it beyond the return date, so I decided to quickly test them on my laptop.  I watched a few scenes from each DVD & didn't encounter any problems. Nothing was missing & the closed captioning worked on my laptop too.There are 6 episodes, the entire miniseries, of Roots on three DVD's, as well as, extras which include; audio commentary by  David L. Wolper, 'Video Highlights' with commentary, and a 2002 documentary 'Remembering Roots'(the cast & creators offer their reminiscences). The 4th DVD contains the 2007 documentary, 'Crossing Over: How Roots Captivated an Entire Nation', and 'Roots: One Year Later.'

321078,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,6302571251,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[15, 16]","In 1976, an amazing book about the descendants of a man who had been enslaved hundreds of years earlier in Africa and forcibly brought to America was released.  That book, calledRoots: ""The Saga of an American Family""and written by Alex Haley (1921-1992), became a best-seller and was immediately transformed into a TV miniseries that first aired in 1977.  Only a few years following the civil rights movement, which followed decades of segregation and inequalities for African Americans that resulted after being freed in 1865 at the close of the Civil War, the book and miniseries had a profound affect on many people in helping them understand the suffering that African Americans endured not only as slaves before 1865, but also how African Americans had been treated through to the civil rights movement.  All this was because one man who had been enslaved in Africa in 1767, Kunta Kinte (played by a young Levar Burton, then by an the older actor John Amos), who was given the slave name of Toby Reynolds, impressed upon his daughter Kizzy (Leslie Uggams) the need for her to remember where he had come from and that he had been born free. She passed this knowledge onto her son 'Chicken' George Moore (Ben Vereen), who lived to see the end of the Civil War and freedom, and he passed it onto his children who continued the tradition until it reached the ears of Alex Haley in the twentieth century.  Alex Haley then decided to research his family and was able to finally locate the exact village in Gambia where Kunta Kinte had been born.With brilliant acting, an amazing plot, wonderful direction under Marvin J. Chomsky, John Erman, David Green and Gilbert Moses, the 1977 ""Roots"" TV miniseries was a masterpiece when it first aired and remains a masterpiece to this day.  With the graphic depictions of Kunta's enslavement, his tortuous journey aboard a slave ship across the Atlantic Ocean, his mistreatment as a slave, several failed escape attempts, the sale of Kizzy to another slave owner and the struggles that the descendants endured after being freed, ""Roots"" had a definite impact upon those who watched and it inspired many Americans to research their own family histories.  Not surprisingly, ""Roots"" won nine Emmy Awards, including for ""Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series"", ""Outstanding Film Editing in a Drama Series"" and ""Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series"".  It was also nominated for an additional 28 Emmy's.  It also won the Golden Globe for ""Best TV-Series - Drama"", and Leslie Uggams was nominated for a Golden Globe for ""Best TV Actress - Drama"".  Other notable performances in ""Roots"" include Capt. Thomas Davies (Edward Asner) and Fiddler (Louis Gossett Jr.).

It was a terrible time for our country. I think all Americans should watch this sometimes in their lifetime.  I am a caucasian American who comes from a family of share croppers.  They never owned their own land and had to share their crops with the land owners.  It was hard times for them also; while they were not beaten and forced to separate from their families, they had to work as hard as the slaves just to make a living and were looked down on as white trash. YES, I think slavery was wrong.  But some do not realize that it was Africans (black Africans) who rounded up their fellow Africans to sell them into slavery in the first place.  And while it was a terrible time for our country to allow this, most don't think about the opportunity they have today from the suffering of their ancestors. Today, all Americans,  have the freedom and choice to live in America and become whom ever they want to become.  Without slavery in the first place these same decendents may still be in Africa starving or killing their own people. So, watch this dvd, cry with the pain the slaves had to go through, but then get down on our knees and thank God for all the suffering our ancestors went through (mine and yours) to allow us to be who we are today. Let's once in for all stop bringing racism into every aspect of society.  We are all God's people so, please, please....this was your ancestors suffering for you today.

Back then, all I learned was that Kunta Kinte was renamed Toby and that we may be descendents of Africans.  This time I viewed the DVD in a whole different light; the importance of knowing your past so that you can move towards the future.This DVD is great because it shows the importance of sharing family history.  If the Haleys/Palmers/Thomases/Harveys and so forth had not shared the information from generation to generation then Alex Haley would not have taken such an interest in finding his ancestors.Now, when I watched the DVD, I thought it was entirely true.  I wondered how they could remember in such detail.  I later learned that Haley coined his book FACTION, a combination of fiction and facts.  Anyway, the story has been criticized mainly on the ground that Haley could not have been a descendent of Kunta Kinte' because Kunta Kinte was dead in the year of Kizzy Reynolds conception and birth.  Even if this is true, I think it still is an excellent attempt at telling the story of a black man in America.After viewing the DVD, I went to a-n-cestry dot com and found the census records online.  I was able to find ancestors back to the late 1800s.  Unfortunately, I found out how difficult it was from ROOTS because our last names changed at the drop of a hat and, thus, unless you know the last names of the people at all time, it will be very hard to locate the people.Anyway, I plan to have my children (when I have them) watch this DVD just so they can know how far black people have come.",5,Pass it down to your future generations,1205193600,"03 11, 2008",2008,1558,"['first', 'watched', 'DVD', '70', '80', 'Back', 'then', 'learned', 'was', 'Kunta', 'Kinte', 'was', 'renamed', 'Toby', 'may', 'be', 'descendents', 'Africans', 'time', 'viewed', 'DVD', 'whole', 'different', 'light', 'importance', 'knowing', 'past', 'can', 'move', 'future.This', 'DVD', 'great', 'importance', 'sharing', 'family', 'history', 'Haleys/Palmers/Thomases/Harveys', 'so', 'forth', 'had', 'not', 'shared', 'information', 'generation', 'generation', 'then', 'Alex', 'Haley', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'taken', 'interest', 'finding', 'ancestors.Now', 'when', 'watched', 'DVD', 'thought', 'was', 'entirely', 'true', 'wondered', 'how', 'could', 'remember', 'such', 'detail', 'later', 'learned', 'Haley', 'coined', 'book', 'FACTION', 'combination', 'fiction', 'facts', 'Anyway', 'story', 'been', 'criticized', 'mainly', 'ground', 'Haley', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'descendent', 'Kunta', 'Kinte', 'Kunta', 'Kinte', 'was', 'dead', 'year', 'Kizzy', 'Reynolds', 'conception', 'birth', 'Even', 'true', 'think', 'still', 'excellent', 'attempt', 'telling', 'story', 'black', 'man', 'America.After', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'went', 'a-n-cestry', 'dot', 'com', 'found', 'census', 'records', 'online', 'was', 'able', 'find', 'ancestors', 'back', 'late', '1800s', 'Unfortunately', 'found', 'out', 'how', 'difficult', 'was', 'ROOTS', 'last', 'names', 'changed', 'drop', 'hat', 'thus', 'know', 'last', 'names', 'people', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'hard', 'locate', 'people.Anyway', 'plan', 'have', 'children', 'when', 'have', 'watch', 'DVD', 'just', 'so', 'can', 'know', 'how', 'far', 'black', 'people', 'have', 'come']",N/A

A miniseries with a huge budget, covering two continents and over 100 years of time.  It made Americans think about a time in history that some knew little about, and wanted to think about even less.

[Though the bare breasts probably were ...])Alas, in my opinion, the series has NOT stood the test of time.  Instead of an engaging story about a fascinating family, it feels more like a 9 hour sermon.The acting is mostly fine, in that the actors do the best they can with the material they are given, but most of the characters are utterly 2 dimensional, from the pious sea captain and his evil first officer (delicioiusly played by Ralph Waite) through the many slave owners and the slaves themselves. Much of the dialogue is stilted with far too much pointless exposition. (And to nitpick a bit, everyone, once they get off the boat, is entirely too clean and well-dressed, and even well housed.  I should live as well as Toby and Bell!

And performed a great service in taking figures of slavery, which have mostly been portrayed as stereotypes, even when well-meant stereosypes, and turning them into real people you care deeply about. As noted in my review title, the only jarring note in the film, and it was unavoidable, I'm sure, was the casting of such familiar faces as Ed Asner, Chuck Conners, etc. etc., who mostly portrayed characters who were not that lovable inasmuch as most of them were on the wrong side of the slavery issue.
