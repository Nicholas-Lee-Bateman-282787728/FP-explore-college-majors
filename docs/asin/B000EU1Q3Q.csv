978827,A1VQBHHXIKHIGS,B000EU1Q3Q,A Customer,"[2, 36]","I'm remembering the black and white TV series with George Reeves. Why not?One great thing about growing up in Roxboro, North Carolina in the 1970s is that the place was in a time warp. I've seen TV programs and heard songs on the radio that I am too young to have seen and heard. Yes I have.One great thing about growing up in Tampa, Florida in the 1970s and 1980s is that, in addition to network TV, they have a very cool independent TV station scene happening, which began long before cable TV discovered reruns are often better than new stuff. We got the best of the best down there, man, including this little review right here.The blaring intro wound up with ""...truth, justice, and the American way!"" My response was always, ""three different things."" Zing! Dissident!Little brother Barry noted that every episode ended the same way. Dude shoots at Superman, who just stands there with hands on hips puffing up his chest. Ha! Then frustrated dude throws empty gun at Superman, who steps out of the way. As in, actor can laugh at fake bullets but the damn gun would hurt like hell. Puss.In between, there was Clark Kent, who was much more ""Father Knows Best"" than ""mild mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper,"" at the manual typewriter. Didn't mean a damn thing to me at the time. But years later, Mom gave me a used manual typewriter for Christmas that looked exactly like the George Reeves Clark Kent model. Royal, heavier than a boat anchor, loud enough to make little brother Barry leap over a tall sofa and slap me upside the head in a single bound. I learned to type on that monster, and a coupla years later I may have even begun to learn how to write on it. Be grateful you never read anything I typed there and let's move quickly on.Superman the first TV series. Damned if I remember. If I saw it now I'd probably be disappointed. I suspect 50s and 60s TV was better than 70s TV, because the fools that wrote 70s TV were trying to copy the crap they saw growing up in the 50s and 60s. Maybe the 50s and 60s writers knew they wrote crap and the 70s folks did not. Or maybe I just don't care and this review is over.But dig this. Every show ended with some blabber about how it was based on the character from Superman Magazine. And that bugged me to no end because I'd never seen such a thing. Turns out they meant the comic book. I've read many comic books I've loved, but come on. Pretending that the 1970s comic books are Superman Magazine is almost as bad as saying McDonald's Restaurant with a straight face.",3,Superman,1156636800,"08 27, 2006",2006,2539,"[""'m"", 'remembering', 'black', 'white', 'TV', 'series', 'George', 'Reeves', 'Why', 'not', 'One', 'great', 'thing', 'growing', 'up', 'Roxboro', 'North', 'Carolina', '1970s', 'place', 'was', 'time', 'warp', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'TV', 'programs', 'heard', 'songs', 'radio', 'am', 'too', 'young', 'have', 'seen', 'heard', 'Yes', 'have.One', 'great', 'thing', 'growing', 'up', 'Tampa', 'Florida', '1970s', '1980s', 'addition', 'network', 'TV', 'have', 'very', 'cool', 'independent', 'TV', 'station', 'scene', 'happening', 'began', 'long', 'before', 'cable', 'TV', 'discovered', 'reruns', 'are', 'often', 'better', 'new', 'stuff', 'got', 'best', 'best', 'down', 'there', 'man', 'including', 'little', 'review', 'right', 'here.The', 'blaring', 'intro', 'wound', 'up', 'truth', 'justice', 'American', 'way', 'response', 'was', 'always', 'three', 'different', 'things', 'Zing', 'Dissident', 'Little', 'brother', 'Barry', 'noted', 'episode', 'ended', 'same', 'way', 'Dude', 'shoots', 'Superman', 'who', 'just', 'hands', 'hips', 'puffing', 'up', 'chest', 'Ha', 'Then', 'frustrated', 'dude', 'throws', 'empty', 'gun', 'Superman', 'who', 'way', 'actor', 'can', 'laugh', 'fake', 'bullets', 'damn', 'gun', 'would', 'hurt', 'hell', 'Puss.In', 'was', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'who', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'Father', 'Knows', 'Best', 'mild', 'mannered', 'reporter', 'great', 'metropolitan', 'newspaper', 'manual', 'typewriter', 'Did', ""n't"", 'mean', 'damn', 'thing', 'time', 'years', 'later', 'Mom', 'gave', 'used', 'manual', 'typewriter', 'Christmas', 'looked', 'exactly', 'George', 'Reeves', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'model', 'Royal', 'heavier', 'boat', 'anchor', 'loud', 'enough', 'make', 'little', 'brother', 'Barry', 'tall', 'sofa', 'slap', 'head', 'single', 'bound', 'learned', 'type', 'monster', 'coupla', 'years', 'later', 'may', 'have', 'even', 'begun', 'learn', 'how', 'write', 'Be', 'grateful', 'never', 'read', 'anything', 'typed', 'let', 'move', 'quickly', 'first', 'TV', 'series', 'Damned', 'remember', 'saw', 'now', ""'d"", 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'suspect', '50s', '60s', 'TV', 'was', 'better', '70s', 'TV', 'fools', 'wrote', '70s', 'TV', 'were', 'trying', 'copy', 'crap', 'saw', 'growing', 'up', '50s', '60s', 'Maybe', '50s', '60s', 'writers', 'knew', 'wrote', 'crap', '70s', 'folks', 'did', 'not', 'maybe', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'review', 'over.But', 'dig', 'show', 'ended', 'blabber', 'how', 'was', 'based', 'character', 'Superman', 'Magazine', 'bugged', 'end', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'thing', 'out', 'meant', 'comic', 'book', ""'ve"", 'read', 'many', 'comic', 'books', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'come', 'Pretending', '1970s', 'comic', 'books', 'are', 'Superman', 'Magazine', 'almost', 'as', 'bad', 'saying', 'McDonald', 'Restaurant', 'straight', 'face']",Adventures of Superman: The Complete Third & Fourth Seasons
978828,AWHCZ5K04JYOD,B000EU1Q3Q,Andrew Ice,"[3, 3]","I would recommend this dvd after buying the first 2 , which featured the B&W; seasons. The first season is a different show, mostly serious, hard hitting, with a 1940's 'film noir' quality. The series became more 'kid friendly' in the second season, but several episodes were still on a par with the first season.This dvd features the 3rd and 4th season, the first ones shot in color. The comedic tone is set in the first episode when the daily Planet crew is sent back in time to prehistoric times. Those times consisting of a few rocks and a cave.What saves this show for me is the always ernest performance and charm of George Reeves, and the appeal of the cast even in the dumbest stories. There are still some excellent episodes, but even at their worst this show has an appeal that makes them watchable.George is starting to get a little long in the tooth already, and I recently noticed that he starts to belt his pants way too high-like Fred Mertz on 'I Love Lucy"".

978830,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B000EU1Q3Q,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[87, 93]","I've written often about the deterioration in quality of ""The Adventures of Superman"" after color was introduced, in 1954, and I'll still stand by the statement, for the last seasons of the series...But having just sat through this collection of the third and fourth seasons' color episodes, allow me to ""eat crow""...these episodes are VERY entertaining, and certainly are far better than I remembered!The decision to shoot in color was a bold move, by sponsor Kellogg's, producer Whitney Ellsworth, and the series' home studio, Motion Pictures for Television Inc,(MPTV), as the technology to even air color programming would not be widely available to local television stations for nearly a decade. Series like AOS, ""The Cisco Kid"", and ""The Lone Ranger"", in choosing to use the far more expensive process, understood that these programs would have a 'lifespan' far beyond the 1950s audience. Certainly, in the case of AOS, the continuing popularity of the show, and the sales of these collections prove their point!Because of the expense of color, the seasons would be slashed from 26 to 13 episodes per season, which was a godsend to the cast, particularly George Reeves. Lighting for color was MUCH brighter and hotter than for black and white, and the costume department realized Reeves' original brown-and-gray, frequently sweat-stained ""shoulder-padded longjohns"" would be even more of a problem in future. A 'genius' decided to redesign the costume, creating a thicker, full-body red and blue suit of foam rubber, which would not 'show' perspiration (but would, sadly, make the actor appear much stockier). While in theory this was a great idea, in truth, it was a disaster, as the suit didn't 'breathe', with 'locked-in' sweat causing severe rashes and frequent heat exhaustion for Reeves. A half-hour stretch was the maximum he could wear it, safely, making for long 'shooting days'...and the physical torture of the suit would 'age' Reeves, rapidly, over the remainder of the series.Knowing this, my respect for Reeves' professionalism has increased, and this collection offers some of his really terrific performances, as well as some of Noel Neill and Jack Larson's best work, as well. Among my favorites are ""Superman Week"" and ""King For a Day"" (which shows Reeves still willing to manhandle baddies...something that would soon be completely eliminated as Kellogg's bowed to parental pressure for less violence); ""Jimmy the Kid"", offering Larson a meaty dual role, as both 'comic relief' Jimmy Olsen, and a notorious gunman; and, best of all, ""The Wedding of Superman"", an acting tour-de-force by Neill, in a remarkably sensitive (and prophetic, for ""Lois & Clark"" fans) episode of Lois and Superman finally acknowledging their love. This episode is acclaimed as one of the finest episodes of the entire series, and shouldn't be missed!So, if you harbor an illusion that the color episodes will be a disappointment, like I did, I strongly urge you to reconsider, and buy this collection...I think you'll be in for a VERY pleasant surprise!",5,"Surprisingly Entertaining, and Reeves is Superb!",1151539200,"06 29, 2006",2006,3053,"[""'ve"", 'written', 'often', 'deterioration', 'quality', 'Adventures', 'Superman', 'color', 'was', 'introduced', '1954', ""'ll"", 'still', 'stand', 'statement', 'last', 'seasons', 'series', 'having', 'just', 'sat', 'collection', 'third', 'fourth', 'seasons', 'color', 'episodes', 'allow', 'eat', 'crow', 'episodes', 'are', 'VERY', 'entertaining', 'certainly', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'remembered', 'decision', 'shoot', 'color', 'was', 'bold', 'move', 'sponsor', 'Kellogg', 'producer', 'Whitney', 'Ellsworth', 'series', 'home', 'studio', 'Motion', 'Pictures', 'Television', 'Inc', 'MPTV', 'technology', 'even', 'air', 'color', 'programming', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'widely', 'available', 'local', 'television', 'stations', 'nearly', 'decade', 'Series', 'AOS', 'Cisco', 'Kid', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'choosing', 'use', 'far', 'more', 'expensive', 'process', 'understood', 'programs', 'would', 'have', ""'lifespan"", 'far', '1950s', 'audience', 'Certainly', 'case', 'AOS', 'continuing', 'popularity', 'show', 'sales', 'collections', 'prove', 'point', 'expense', 'color', 'seasons', 'would', 'be', 'slashed', '26', '13', 'episodes', 'season', 'was', 'godsend', 'cast', 'particularly', 'George', 'Reeves', 'Lighting', 'color', 'was', 'MUCH', 'brighter', 'hotter', 'black', 'white', 'costume', 'department', 'realized', 'Reeves', 'original', 'brown-and-gray', 'frequently', 'sweat-stained', 'shoulder-padded', 'longjohns', 'would', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'problem', 'future', ""'genius"", 'decided', 'redesign', 'costume', 'creating', 'thicker', 'full-body', 'red', 'blue', 'suit', 'foam', 'rubber', 'would', 'not', ""'show"", 'perspiration', 'would', 'sadly', 'make', 'actor', 'appear', 'much', 'stockier', 'theory', 'was', 'great', 'idea', 'truth', 'was', 'disaster', 'suit', 'did', ""n't"", ""'breathe"", ""'locked-in"", 'sweat', 'causing', 'severe', 'rashes', 'frequent', 'heat', 'exhaustion', 'Reeves', 'half-hour', 'stretch', 'was', 'maximum', 'could', 'wear', 'safely', 'making', 'long', ""'shooting"", 'days', 'physical', 'torture', 'suit', 'would', ""'age"", 'Reeves', 'rapidly', 'remainder', 'series.Knowing', 'respect', 'Reeves', 'professionalism', 'increased', 'collection', 'really', 'terrific', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'Noel', 'Neill', 'Jack', 'Larson', 'best', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'favorites', 'are', 'Superman', 'Week', 'King', 'Day', 'Reeves', 'still', 'willing', 'manhandle', 'baddies', 'something', 'would', 'soon', 'be', 'completely', 'eliminated', 'Kellogg', 'bowed', 'parental', 'pressure', 'less', 'violence', 'Kid', 'offering', 'Larson', 'meaty', 'dual', 'role', ""'comic"", 'relief', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'notorious', 'gunman', 'best', 'Wedding', 'Superman', 'acting', 'tour-de-force', 'Neill', 'remarkably', 'sensitive', 'prophetic', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'fans', 'episode', 'Lois', 'Superman', 'finally', 'acknowledging', 'love', 'episode', 'acclaimed', 'one', 'finest', 'episodes', 'entire', 'series', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'missed', 'So', 'harbor', 'illusion', 'color', 'episodes', 'will', 'be', 'disappointment', 'did', 'strongly', 'urge', 'reconsider', 'buy', 'collection', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'VERY', 'pleasant', 'surprise']",Adventures of Superman: The Complete Third & Fourth Seasons

One reviewer said that in many respects it looks like a different show. I have to agree. I'm not in favor of the decision made to shoot these subsequent seasons in color although I understand the economic reasons why the decision was made. Still the show remains fresh and top notch compared to other series and there are some more adult-like episodes to match the black and white seasons. ""The Seven Souvenirs"" is a prime example and is, to my mind, the most perfectly paced episode of the whole series. It glides along and George Reeves is at the very top if his game, acting-wise, throughout the episode. Watch his delivery during the climax when he is revealing what the thefts are really about. Jimmy Olsen playing a twin bad guy, in another episode, is a riot in that part. Many of the villians are played in a more Damon Runyon style and are very funny.

Special features include a piece entitled ""Adventures of Superman: The Color Era"" and another called ""Faster Than a Speeding Bullet: The Special Effects of The Adventures Of Superman.""The former, about the series being filmed in color features interviews with Jack Larsen, Noel Neill, Gary Grossman (author of ""Superman: Serial to Cereal"") and a television historian whose name escapes me. All pretty much agree that it was a shrewd move of the producers to start filming the show in color, and saving the negatives until color television was common a decade later. In the words of Larsen, ""Those guys were pretty smart.""The one about the sfx was mainly a profile and interview with Thol Simonson, along with Larsen and Neill. Both cast members were effusive with praise for Simonson, saying they always felt safe, no matter how risky the effect looked on screen. Something I had not seen before is a diagram of the ""pan"" apparatus and counterbalance that replaced the wires that had earlier suspended Reeves.Episodes I have watched so far are ""The Wedding of Superman,"" ""The Big Freeze,"" and ""Through the Time Barrier.""

978846,A1E0APHODMK896,B000EU1Q3Q,"Eric Hildebrand ""Flapdoodle""","[5, 5]","Jack Larson, playing Jimmy Olsen, was probably the last adult actor of the 20th century to be able to convincingly utter the word `jeepers,' and that fact says something about the value of this wonderful series.  Jack Larson's portrayal of young Olsen was so popular that, in 1954, DC comics gave Jimmy Olsen his own comic book.By this time also, Jimmy's role in the weekly Superman TV show had expanded.  At least 3 episodes from this collection, 'Olsen's Millions,' 'King for Day,' and 'The Bully of Dry Gulch' were lifted directly from the early issues of the Jimmy Olsen comic book.  (BTW, the original, comic book versions of these `Jimmy Olsen' stories were written by none other than Otto Binder, the legendary sci-fi author who wrote the best of the original Capt. Marvel comics.  Superman's publishers had, by 1954, sued Capt. Marvel out of existence, but Binder, along with artists Kurt Schaffenberger and Pete Costanza, eventually went to work on Superman's magazines.  Superman's magazines, in turn, gradually absorbed many of the traits of Capt. Marvel stories.)Seasons 3-4, the 1st two seasons filmed in color, mark an increase in humor, whimsy, and sometimes all-out goofiness, when compared to the seasons 1-2, which were in B/W.  There is still plenty of excitement and peril in these episodes,  but when I was 12 years old, watching this series for the 1st time (rerun by Channel 33 in Youngstown, Ohio), the humorous and whimsical touches used to bug me: I took my heroes extremely seriously, and didn't like the implication that this could be in any way a `kiddie' show.I am in my 40's now, and do not take it as a personal insult when I watch these episodes.  Most of the time, you still get a disciplined, well-constructed, well-acted story that usually involves either Superman or the audience trying to solve some sort of puzzle.  Usually too, either Jimmy, Lois, Perry or any combination thereof faces some sort of mortal peril.It should also be noted of course, that the Supeman comics published during this period (and up through 1980'S!) often featured stories that where deliberately humourous of goofy as well, so it can be argued the the producers were just taking their cues from the funnies.One thing that impresses me as an adult, besides the understated but high quality writing, is the dedication and professionalism of the cast.  If you really study George Reeves, you will see that in every scene the man was ON, and that he really was a very good actor.  For instance, if you observe him when he is about to pull off his Kent clothes to change to Superman, he always makes subtle movements of his arms, shoulders, hips, his head, any part(s) of his body, as if his muscles are literally wanting to burst out of his suit so he can spring into action.Also, Reeves had a fantastic voice: strong, clear, intelligent and masculine, but with undertones of gentleness and kindness.  Those qualities are the essence of Reeves's  Superman.  This idea of a man who could be simpultaneously strong, wise and compassionate, is probably why Reeves's Superman is so fondly remembered and still enjoyable.  He is a kind of super father-figure.In fact, from Season 2 and onward, the show featured the occasional child guest star, which of course was a device to reinforce kids' emotional involvement in the adventures.  In these episodes, you can see that Reeves had an excellent chemistry with the kids, naturally paternal, so it's sad that Reeves never had children.Likewise, the characters of Jimmy, Lois and Perry also resemble, perhaps unconsciously, family members of the target audience.  Jimmy and Lois especially would tend to serve as surrogates for viewers, allowing audience members to imagine themselves sharing the adventures.  But these characters would simultaneously have reminded youngsters of bothers and sisters, with Lois sometimes acting in place of a mother instead. The feeling of family is one of the things that distinguish this series from later versions. And of course, when I was 12, it was easier to put myself in Jimmy Olsen's shoes and to imagine an annoying girl as Lois Lane.On the whole, these episodes are almost as good as those of Season 2, especially if you factor in the fact that the colors for Reeves' super suit look so great, and that Noel Neill definitely is prettier in color.  Also, the special effects for the color seasons were more sophisticated than the B/W episodes.  In fact, this collection has a really neat little featurette about Thol Simonson, the man who did the special effects, and he was still alive and looking good! (The man is 90 years old if he is a day!)It's true that the color episodes do not have the `edge' that Season 1 and some of Season 2 had, but the overall tone of the series carries through, and all of the craftsmanship and charm is there.  I highly recommend this product, it is still over 11 hours of highly entertaining programming.  Now for a little TV scavenger hunt: 2 episodes on this collection contain direct references to the 2 best episodes of Season 2, `Defeat of Superman,' and `Panic in the Sky.'  I challenge you to find the episodes to which I refer.",5,Color Him Super,1206662400,"03 28, 2008",2008,5168,"['Jack', 'Larson', 'playing', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'was', 'probably', 'last', 'adult',

He is the definitiveinvestigative reporter; not the bumbling, goof-ballthat the movie Superman portrays him to be. The colorTV episodes are much funnier and lighter than theblack and white season one episodes and the color isfantastic and weel preserved except where I notebelow.The characters are wonderful too. You will seeSTERLING HOLLOWAY (the future voice of Winnie thePooh) as daffy scientist Prof. Twiddle in ""Through theTime Barrier"", CLAUDE AKINS (the future Sheriff ElroyP. Lobo and AAMCO Transmissions spokeman) as aplotting submarine commander in ""Peril by the Sea"",CHUCK CONNORS (the future Lukas McCain a.k.a. THERIFLEMAN) as a country bumpkin in ""Flight to theNorth"", PAUL BURKE (future DYNASTY TV series' NealMcVane) in ""The Phantom Ring"", JOHN BERADINO (later tobecome Dr. Steve Hardy in TV's GENERAL HOSPITAL from1963-96) in ""The Unlucky Number"". All are fast moving,action packed episodes.If you remember that George Reeves really loved tobust through walls and doors and just about anythingto make the TV epsode more thrilling, you'll reallyget a real kick out of it when you see him do it againand again in almost every episode. He actually helpedplan many of the stunts and was very atheletic. Hewould jump off a ladder to do the landings and wouldbounce off a spring board and do a forward-roll onto amattress for the take-offs; many times right over thecmera-man.My biggest complaint, which may seem minor to manyother fans, is that the opening color sequence wherewe hear the announcer say, ""Faster than a speedingbullet! More powerful that a locomotive..."", all theway to the end, comes from a certain 1957 episode andis badly scratched and deteriorated, especially at thebeginning. It is used to open each and every episodeof the entire 1955, 1956 and 1957 seasons that are onthis DVD set. Why the DVD production team picked oneof the worst condition openings to subject viewers toover and over again is beyond reason. ""Copyright 1957""is seen at the bottom of each 1955 and 1956 episode.The episode's correct copyright date appears in ROMANNUMERALS at the end of the episode just prior to thecast credits.For trivia fans only: they changed the revolver from aSmith and Wesson (which was used in the black andwhite episodes) to a Colt in the color episode openingsequence. The DVD freeze frame feature allows you seethat the color photographed revolver's cylinderrotates upward (clockwise: Colt) while the B&W;revolver's cylinder revolves downward(counter-clockwise: S&W;).By the way, Noel Neill (Lois Lane) and Jack Larson(Jimmy Olsen) have bit parts in the movie ""SupermanReturns"". Noel Neill is the dying billionairess in theopening sequence and Jack Larson is the old bartenderwith the bowtie. Too bad that film didn't have morehumor in it and move a little faster.Iunderstand that the 5th and 6th Seasons are due out in November, 2006.With only 16 episodes left, I wonder with what extras the producers of the DVD set will fill the five discs.

While seasons 1 & 2 both had 26 episodes per season, beginning with season 3 the number of episodes produced per season was cut in half to only 13.  The show also went to color, which took up a large part of the show's budget.  (As a side note, these episodes were originally shown on TV in black and white, first appearing in color in the 1960's.)  Also, by the time of the third season, the focus on the show had really changed to more of a ""kid's"" show, with little of the violence that had defined the first season in particular.  It certainly makes the show a very different show to watch from the previous first two seasons, but enjoyable in it's own right.  And you might find this box easier to watch with the whole family.Here's what you get in this set:Season 3 includes:Through the Time BarrierThe Talking ClueThe Lucky CatSuperman WeekGreat Caesar's GhostTest of a WarriorOlsen's MillionsClark Kent, OutlawThe Magic NecklaceThe Bully of Dry GulchFlight to the NorthThe Seven SouvenirsKing For a DaySeason 4 includes:JoeyThe Unlucky NumberThe Big FreezePeril By SeaTopsy TurvyJimmy the KidThe Girl Who Hired SupermanThe Wedding of SupermanDagger IslandBlackmailThe Deadly RockThe Phantom RingThe Jolly RogerThe extras include:Adventures of Superman: The Color EraFaster Than a Speeding Bullet: The Special Effects of Adventures of SupermanLook, Up in the Sky: The Amazing Story of Superman (excerpts from the new documentary produced by Bryan Singer and Kevin Burns)Another nice touch - there's also a ticket for Superman Returns included in this set!I'm assuming Warner Home Video will do the same excellent job on this package that they have on the first two.  And I give them kudos for including 26 episodes and not trying to gouge the fans by only including 13 episodes per set.  Plus the free movie ticket!

So, I'm going to try here to put things in perspective.In terms of the picture quality, i agree that the transfers could have been better. Although in color, the picture looks rather faded and washed out, and there are many imperfections. On the other hand, we're assuming here that Warners had the capability of cleaning the picture. Perhaps they did not, and were limited to less than perfect source material. So I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.As far as the episodes themselves, my fondness for them is mainly based on a sense of nostalgia, as I used to watch the show every day back in the 1960s. In terms of the stories, they can't compare to the first seasons. In fact, despite the same cast (with the exception of Lois Lane) it feels like two completely different shows. The first seasons scripts, which featured Phyllis Coates as Lois, were well written dramas, with a no-nonsense Superman acting as an avenging angel, ringing in the bad guys (who were actually quite menacing) The drama was tense, the dialogue crackled, the acting and direction was great, as was the background music. The second season stories were toned down a bit, but there were still some great episodes(""Panic in the sky"", ""A Ghost for Scotland Yard"", ""The Face and the Voice"", etc.) By the time the series went to color, the scripts were toned down even further. the bad guys were no longer punched out by Superman, and were more comic than menacing.  Still, there were some good episodes in seasons 3 and 4, including ""Great Caesars Ghost"", ""Test of a Warrior"", and ""the wedding of Superman"". Basically, the episodes written by Jackson Gillis are the best (same goes for season 2)The episodes written by David Chantler are worse...some are downright boring. The dialogue and direction in season 3 and 4 also were vastly inferior to seasons 1 and 2. (I guess when Tommy Carr read the new scripts, he wanted nothing to do with them.) Having said all that, I don't want to seem hypocritical. I did buy the set, and have no regrets that I did.It was a great series, albeit one that went through many changes during its six year run. Unfortunately, the only change for the better was going to color.

But if you're thinking about ponying up for this set like I did, there's two questions you need to ask:1) How are the prints?First of all, don't expect the same quality as the B&W; season 1 & 2 sets. There's a stock 1957 opening that's a little rough. And luckily none of the episodes seem to have the excessive print damage that say ""The Stolen Costume"" had in the first season set. However, the colour isn't perfect. In many cases, the technicolour picture is perfectly sharp and crystal clear - amazing for prints that are 50 years old. But then the camera will quickly cut to a more soft, washed out shot or scene - from a 100% sharpness to about 80% resolution - and it gets very distracting at times. This happens constantly. I've read they had a lot of restoration work to do on this one and it's too bad they couldn't correct this so the print is uniformly sharp. You get used to the picture after a while. But it is disappointing considering what they were able to pull off with the first two season sets.2) How are the stories? I heard they turned it into a kids' show!Well, in terms of the storylines themselves, many of the shows have devolved to the standard two thugs ""Whadda we do now, boss?"" type of situations. Sure, it's still highly entertaining and George Reeves is still letter perfect. But the show has certainly lost a step in these seasons compared to the second and particularly the first season's harder edged radio serial leanings.As for Lois Lane, Noel Neil has her moments. But at this point in the series, she seems far too sunny and perky for the role and has very little rivalry with Clark - although the softening of the scripts don't help her out here. For my money, Phyllis Coates just nailed Lois perfectly in the first season - she's the damsel in distress obviously (and what a screamer!) but still the feisty, business-like, tough as nails reporter (unlike Noel here).

D.,"[7, 10]","Superman in COLOR!WOW!I just received my copy of season 3 in the mail and have been a couch potato most of the day as I sat watching episode after episode.The first thing I noticed is that the famous ""intro"" we all know doesn't appear to be ""cleaned up"" by Warner Brothers. By that I mean they're chock full of specks and film scratches, looking pretty bad overall. For a minute, I thought I was in for a day of watching terrible transfers of each episode.That is, until the actual episode started. WOW! Talk about great looking! I remember seeing some of these color episodes when they were let out of the vaults to play on TV long after they were originally made (in the 50's they were ONLY broadcast in black-and-white). But seeing the transfer placed on these DVDs is like watching all new episodes! Not only is the color excellent, but seeing the ENTIRE episode again (instead of those heavily edited versions we'd all watch in later years on commercial television) was a huge plus as well! I can only praise the great job Warner did here.Sure, the episodes aren't as serious as the first season, but they definitely are enjoyable nonetheless. I especially enjoy the humor as Clark/Superman would quip some comment about his alter-identity to the others at the end of most episodes. The other characters in the series may have been ""dumb to the world"", but WE all knew what he was hinting at, DIDN'T we?And even though you'd THINK seeing the ""flubs"" on screen in these replays would make watching the series less enjoyable; I actually ENJOY ""catching what I missed seeing back then"". One such example is when Superman puts the crook's heads between jail cell bars he bent with his bare hands. But watch when he places one of the guys into that newly opened area. The guy's shoulders slam into the bars and the bars bend just as easily from the force of his shoulders hitting them! Obviously, in reality, the guy would have had 2 broken shoulder blades!There are some great documentaries included on disc 5 as well, including my favorite of the bunch, the one covering the special effects on the TV series. Little did I know that George Reeves loved crashing through those walls! And you have to hand it to George for those fantastic take offs and landings (especially back in through those windows). They've never been done better!

Other changes included more child-friendly stories, as well as shortened thirteen-episode seasons. The result of these changes can be seen here in this DVD boxed-set, which includes the complete third and fourth seasons.For the most part, the quality of the show in terms of storytelling diminished very little, although there are certainly episodes that will make you scratch your head and wonder what the writers were thinking. Nevertheless, the show continues to be a fantastic, character-driven series!The highlights of seasons three and four include: ""Great Caesar's Ghost,"" where gangsters try to drive Perry White insane before testifying in a big case; ""Clark Kent, Outlaw,"" where Clark poses as a safefracker to bring in a crime ring; ""Joey,"" where the Man of Steel and the Daily Planet fight track corruption and win a horse race; ""The Big Freeze,"" where gangsters submit Superman to super-cold temperatures, temporarily robbing him of his powers while trying to force an election to go their way; ""Jimmy the Kid,"" where a look-alike poses as Jimmy Olsen to get information; and ""The Deadly Rock,"" where criminals and a scientist mistake Clark Kent's friend (Robert Lowery, who played DC's number two hero inBatman and Robin - The Complete 1949 Movie Serial Collection), who also has and adverse affect to Kryptonite.The extras on this DVD set include an interesting look at the visual effects of the series, and a six-minute look at the Bryan Singer-producedLook, Up in the Sky!: The Amazing Story of Superman.

978887,A1JJK67VXR1WSR,B000EU1Q3Q,William R. Hancock,"[14, 17]","Warners/DC has now released seasons 3 & 4 of the 1950s classic ""Adventures of Superman"" series, this time in color for the first time.One would like to say the overall collection is as good asthe black & white seasons one and two episodes, but that is not the case. The addition of color to the series created budgetary problems for the producers of the t.v. franchise that more than doubled the costs of each episode. In order to shoot in color, therefore, the t.v. crew had to slash the episode numbers inhalf, from 26 to 13 episodes. This is why we have two seasons in one DVD collection.Money woes were also behind a certain ongoing cheapness in set and properties construction that shows up on film. Walls shake when doors slam, ""rocks"" shudder when Superman drives a fist into them, and, in one episode wherein a submarine lurks off the coast and watches a beachfront house through its periscope,the house and its surroundings are quite obviously not even a painted matte, but, rather, A PEN & INK DRAWING COLORED WITH WATERCOLORS!This is truly indicative of how much cost-cutting has gone on here!The tone of the series has changed radically as well. When AOS began , it was structured as a cinematic extension of the rough and tumble Bud Collyer radio series , with a touch of the old Fleischer cartoons of the forties for added flavor. But by the time the color conversion was getting readied a whirlwind had struck the world of comics. A psychiatrist named Frederick Wertham (called ""Fabulous Freddie""....sarcastically...by comics insiders) had launched a campaign to ""rein in"" the ""extravagant evils"" of comic books and got congress caught up in his driveto ""clean up"" this ""depraved medium"". The innocent minds of the little kiddies had to be protected from such corruptive rot. In the frenzy over ""Werthamism"", entire lines of comics folded, anda new industry regulatory group, the Comics Code Authority, came into being. This was the comic book equivalent of the Hays Office in the film industry.Comics had to, under the new guidelines, ""shape up"" or ship out.Most of the EC titles...from ""Tales From the Crypt"" to ""Vault of Horror"" and ""Weird Science""...did the latter.Other titles, from ""Superman"", ""Batman"", and others, began to ""tone things down"" as well.And what happened to the comics got tied to the AOS t.v. series.The decision was made to ""tone down"" AOS too. Make it more ""kid-friendly"" and less ""stress-inducing"".For this reason, the 3rd and 4th seasons didn't pack the kind of visceral punch the first two seasons did. Some of the episodes are just plain cornball stupid. Others, though, work pretty WELL. ""The Big Freeze"", ""Joey"", ""Dagger Island"", the superb ""The Wedding of Superman"", and ""Test of a Warrior"" (along with a few others) deliver the goods as ""Super"" entertainment. ""Test of a Warrior"" I strongly recall from childhood, wherein Perry White is given the Indian tribal name of ""okeecheeboygan""...""He who writes with thundering machines"".Overall, the color is good in these transfers, if somewhat inconsistent. I don't think this is a film-to-DVD pixelation problem. I think it is a problem inherent in the original color photography. It took a good deal of light (key lighting, sidelighting, back lighting) to shoot good color in those days and I sense that the lighting set-ups in use weren't always sufficient to get the job done ideally. What one notices in various scenes is that the color in CLOSE-UP shots is vibrant and sharp...often simply gorgeous...whereas in medium shots and long shots it tends to have a yellowy , washed out look...and sometimes even looks overexposed. All in all, though, the color looks good and gives the production values some extra ""Pizzaz"".The acting is first rate. The ensemble of Reeves, Neil, Larsen,and Hamilton hits on all cylinders, and Reeves, especially, simply ""owns"" this roll. His Clark Kent is also still the best...and toughest...of all Clark Kents, movie versions included.One additional thing should be said here. The George Reeves Superman comes across, still, as the most POWERFUL Superman.A special feature on Disc 5 involves the special effects of flying in AOS and reminds us of one thing; Superman is the essence of POWER, and his takeoffs and landings IN AOS remind us of that. Reeves utilized the mini-trampoline and coil springboard techniques pioneered at Republic Studios for their ""Captain Marvel"" and ""Rocketman/Commando Cody"" flying hero adventures for his takeoffs (and the jump-from-a-ladder or swing-out-from-a-suspended-bar techniques for his landings). Because of this, the Reeves take-offs and landings have an athletic ""muscularity"" to them that none of his successors have achieved. In fact, in the world of Reeves/Reeve landings, Chris's look positively wussy compared to George's. The screaming-wind sound effect of Superman in flight in AOS is still the best audio accompanyment to all versions, as is the whipping wind effect. Again, all these elements work together to enhance the effect of kinetic POWER here, something that has largely been missed in other versions. I have not seen ""Superman Returns"" yet, so I cannot comment on how well that film evokes the power sense I've been addressing . Hopefully it will do so nicely.So is this collection 3 of AOS worth the loot you need to shell out for it. Sure it is. How could it not be ? The good features still outweigh the clunkers and you're still in for a super good time watching it all.Enjoy!",4,"Not Stellar, But Still Pretty Darn Good",1152316800,"07 8,

Although the story lines seem childish to an adult, the shows survive as happy memories from our younger days, as Lois Lane, Jimmy Olson and others are rescued in the nick of time by Superman, with the bad guys' bullets bouncing off his chest. The extra features that are included are noteworthy, with modern-day interviews of Lois (Noel Neill) and Jimmy (Jack Larson), and explanations of the show's special effects.
