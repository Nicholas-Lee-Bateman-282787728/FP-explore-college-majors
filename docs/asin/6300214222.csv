211625,A1KKTLPJG5J1ZZ,6300214222,Adam,"[3, 4]","This is a delightful film. An Officer and a Gentlemen is about the power of love, the importance of friendship, and the choices we make when challenges come our way.Zack Mayo (Richard Gere) joins the Navy in his hope to become a fighter pilot, where he is constantly challenged , both mentally and physically by the drill sergeant, brilliantly played by Louis Gossett Jr. While this battle is fought out between Gere and Gossett Jr., there is also a sub-plot to the film - that being the friendship with fellow candidate, David Keith. However, the story is strengthened by the powerful relationship that Gere develops with Debra Winger, who plays the part of a factory worker with nuance and vividness, that one marvels at he acting skill.There is a lot of pathos in this film, which creates emotional responses from the viewer. But there also some fantastic uplifting moments. The soundtrack adds to these moments of joy, and by the end of the movie we feel we have purged our pathos, and we believe in the power of love and remember those that made a difference in our lives.",5,Strength of the Human Spirit,1177113600,"04 21, 2007",2007,1077,"['delightful', 'film', 'Officer', 'Gentlemen', 'power', 'love', 'importance', 'friendship', 'choices', 'make', 'when', 'challenges', 'come', 'way.Zack', 'Mayo', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Navy', 'hope', 'become', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'where', 'constantly', 'challenged', 'mentally', 'physically', 'drill', 'sergeant', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Louis', 'Gossett', 'Jr', 'battle', 'fought', 'out', 'Gere', 'Gossett', 'Jr.', 'also', 'sub-plot', 'film', 'being', 'friendship', 'fellow', 'candidate', 'David', 'Keith', 'However', 'story', 'strengthened', 'powerful', 'relationship', 'Gere', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'who', 'part', 'factory', 'worker', 'nuance', 'vividness', 'one', 'marvels', 'acting', 'skill.There', 'lot', 'pathos', 'film', 'emotional', 'responses', 'viewer', 'also', 'fantastic', 'uplifting', 'moments', 'soundtrack', 'moments', 'joy', 'end', 'movie', 'feel', 'have', 'purged', 'pathos', 'believe', 'power', 'love', 'remember', 'made', 'difference', 'lives']",An Officer and A Gentleman VHS
211626,A3W3PK9TVKEH7Q,6300214222,Allen Jackson,"[13, 13]","Just got the new Blu Ray of ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" this week from Amazon.Wow!  The picture is fantastic-- just beautiful, sharp, colorful BR video quality!  The sound is . . . even better.  It's so clear and perfect, coming out of just my HD TV's own speakers, that I didn't know those speakers could sound so good until now.The extras are terrific! Richard Gere, David Keith, David Caruso, Oscar-winner Louis Gossett, Jr., Harold Sylvester, Lisa Eilbacher, Tony Plana, and really ALL the stars and secondary players (except Debra Winger, Lisa Blount, and Robert Loggia), plus the director (Taylor Hackford), producer, and writer are in a wonderful, informative, lengthy 2007 ""making of"" doc.  As are the music writers and music producer for another feature about the Oscar-winning music (but neither Joe Cocker nor Jennifer Warnes participates in this feature).  Also there is another great piece where Gossett returns to Port Townsend, Washington, where it was filmed, showing us the sites and speaking with several local people who were there for the filming in 1981.  These extras were all on the 2007 Special Ed. DVD release, along with another extra on some military romances in real life.  All of the extras look excellent on my HD TV, by the way; not soft focus as if only made for the non-HD DVD.The movie itself is a modern classic, truly a great one in my opinion, which launched and accelerated a lot of young careers.  An honest, gritty portrayal of young people in love and the sexually charged nature of their relationships, complete with honest, raw language--though all of this is very brief in this film, for sure.This Blu Ray gets an A+ from me.  It exceeded all expectations as to picture and sound quality, and I just loved the extras.

211628,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6300214222,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Part love story and part coming of age story, `An Officer and a Gentleman' tends to work on most accounts; surprisingly so.  I say surprisingly since I am not a fan of Gere and found the films prose to be a little, how would you call it, weak; but I was pleasantly surprised by just how much I enjoyed this movie.  Parts are a little preposterous, or should I say a little overdone (the ending in particular is a tad over the top) but for the most part the film seems genuine.The film tells the story of Zack Mayo, a young man who joins the Navy almost to spite his overbearing father but more-or-less to find himself.  He's a lost soul who has no where else to go.  He has sixteen weeks of training under the harsh thumb of Drill Sergeant Foley, and over the course of those sixteen weeks he bonds with his fellow trainees and falls in love with a local girl named Paula Pokrifki.When approaching the budding romance between Zack and Paula the film works very well.  Debra Winger is a stunning actress who commands ones attention and truly knows how to make her character appear real and genuine.  Paula is a very three dimensional character even if she doesn't have a lot of screen time.  We can see her character shift from a young girl looking for some fun to a young girl fallen in love, and her grasp of her characters inner battle between right and wrong is crisp and clear.  Richard Gere is also quite convincing here as well, using his charm to break through the cold way in which he approaches relationships in general.  He is much more effective when broaching the coming of age portion of the film, allowing his back-story to play precedent and influence his characters ambitions (his breakdown during intense training is a pivotal scene that is acted with fervor and dedication).  It is a very strong performance from an actor I usually find bland and overrated.I am shocked that Louis Gossett Jr. won the Oscar for his clich&eacute;d portrayal of Drill Instructor Foley.  I found nothing truly memorable about this performance, and would have rather seen David Keith nominated for his heartbreaking portrayal of the troubled Sid Worley.  He is especially effective in his later scenes where we witness the weight of reality crushing down on his world.  Lisa Blout has a stinging turn as the local girl trying to trap Sid, and Robert Loggia has a very good cameo in the beginning of the film but is not used afterward, which is sad, because I really like him.In the end I can highly recommend this film.  It is nicely crafted and very enjoyable.  Sure, it isn't the most enlightening film out there, and it does come off a little `simple' at times, but the acting is for the most part memorable and the character development is a lot more stable than most films in this genre.  Winger is outstanding (so deserving of the Oscar nomination) and Gere is surprisingly deep here.",4,Light fare that is worth diving into...,1230681600,"12 31, 2008",2008,2887,"['Part', 'love', 'story', 'part', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'Officer', 'Gentleman', 'tends', 'work', 'most', 'accounts', 'surprisingly', 'say', 'surprisingly', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'Gere', 'found', 'films', 'prose', 'be', 'little', 'how', 'would', 'call', 'weak', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Parts', 'are', 'little', 'preposterous', 'should', 'say', 'little', 'overdone', 'ending', 'particular', 'tad', 'top', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'genuine.The', 'film', 'story', 'Zack', 'Mayo', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'Navy', 'almost', 'spite', 'overbearing', 'father', 'more-or-less', 'find', 'lost', 'soul', 'who', 'where', 'else', 'go', 'sixteen', 'weeks', 'training', 'harsh', 'thumb', 'Drill', 'Sergeant', 'Foley', 'course', 'sixteen', 'weeks', 'bonds', 'fellow', 'trainees', 'falls', 'love', 'local', 'girl', 'named', 'Paula', 'Pokrifki.When', 'approaching', 'budding', 'romance', 'Zack', 'Paula', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'stunning', 'actress', 'who', 'ones', 'attention', 'truly', 'how', 'make', 'character', 'appear', 'real', 'genuine', 'Paula', 'very', 'three', 'dimensional', 'character', 'even', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'screen', 'time', 'can', 'see', 'character', 'shift', 'young', 'girl', 'looking', 'fun', 'young', 'girl', 'fallen', 'love', 'grasp', 'characters', 'inner', 'battle', 'right', 'wrong', 'crisp', 'clear', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'also', 'quite', 'convincing', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'using', 'charm', 'break', 'cold', 'way', 'relationships', 'general', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'when', 'broaching', 'coming', 'age', 'portion', 'film', 'allowing', 'back-story', 'play', 'precedent', 'influence', 'characters', 'ambitions', 'breakdown', 'intense', 'training', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'acted', 'fervor', 'dedication', 'very', 'strong', 'performance', 'actor', 'usually', 'find', 'bland', 'overrated.I', 'am', 'shocked', 'Louis', 'Gossett', 'Jr.', 'won', 'Oscar', 'clich', 'eacute', 'portrayal', 'Drill', 'Instructor', 'Foley', 'found', 'nothing', 'truly', 'memorable', 'performance', 'would', 'have', 'rather', 'seen', 'David', 'Keith', 'nominated', 'heartbreaking', 'portrayal', 'troubled', 'Sid', 'Worley', 'especially', 'effective', 'later', 'scenes', 'where', 'witness', 'weight', 'reality', 'crushing', 'down', 'world', 'Lisa', 'Blout', 'stinging', 'turn', 'local', 'girl', 'trying', 'trap', 'Sid', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'very', 'good', 'cameo', 'beginning', 'film', 'not', 'used', 'afterward', 'sad', 'really', 'him.In', 'end', 'can', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'nicely', 'crafted', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'Sure', ""n't"", 'most', 'enlightening', 'film', 'there', 'come', 'off', 'little', 'simple', 'times', 'acting', 'most', 'part', 'memorable', 'character', 'development', 'lot', 'more', 'stable', 'most', 'films', 'genre', 'Winger', 'outstanding', 'deserving', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Gere', 'surprisingly', 'deep', 'here']",An Officer and A Gentleman VHS

It's such a good film, and I loved the performances by everybody including Richard Gere, Debra Winger, Louis Gosset, Jr., Keith David, and Lisa Blount. What makes An Officer and a Gentleman a great film is how compelling the flow is while the chemistry between Debra Winger and Richard Gere is supremely tremendous. Louis Gossett, Jr. obviously shines the most and makes the most memorable character of the film. Nearing the end of the film, I loved how Taylor Hackford shows the cycle with Foley as he was from the beginning when the full-haired blokes along with Gere started off. I wish I could say that An Officer and a Gentleman is a perfect film, but I think it was a little bit unfulfilling. Somehow, I felt like I wanted a little bit more. Although the genius is behind the ""trapping of a mate"" part, I liked how it dramatically affected the characters and the net result afterwards. That was the point it showed what An Officer and a Gentleman is all about. Of course, the romance is a treat on a side note. This film is probably the best of Taylor Hackford's career because it was a lot better directed than his other films such as The Idolmaker, The Devil's Advocate, and Everybody's All American. Another great part about An Officer and a Gentleman is I get to see the wimpy David Caruso be tortured and mocked. That was so much fun; there should be more films doing the same to him. As hard as you might believe, they don't make films like An Officer and a Gentleman anymore.

This means that I watched it once more than I watch most movies, which in turn means that I consider this to be a really great movie.Its protagonist, Zack Mayo (Richard Gere) is a Naval officer candidate who comes from a troubled background. His mother committed suicide when he was young. His father, a career Navy enlisted man, is an alcoholic and womanizer who shows little true affection for the son he must live with. When Zach tells his dad that he intends to be a Navy officer, his dad gives him little support.Zack, who is somewhat rebellious, enters officers' candidate school at a naval base in the Puget Sound area, where he butts heads with Gunnery Sergeant Foley (Louis Gossett, Jr.), whose job it is to do everything he can to break the will of the young men and women under his charge, thereby weeding out those who do not have what it takes to become worthy Naval officers. Through sheer hard work, will, and amazing determination, Zach manages to take the extra punishment he receives for his various indiscretions, while at the same time enduring the rigorous physical training the candidates all must endure.Along the way, he meets Paula (Deborah WInger), a local girl whose immediate goal in life is to marry a naval officer. Zack, who is emotionally stunted and doesn't trust anyone, is happy to have a casual sexual relationship with Paula but resists committing himself to her. This important subplot, in which we see Zack's resistance gradually breaking down, adds immeasurably to the movie and demonstrates the depth of Zach's character.If you haven't seen ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" before, it's definitely worth watching. If it's been a long time since you've watched it, it's worth seeing again.

211646,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,6300214222,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[60, 65]","This film is a classic and viscerally honest portrayal of human conflict and personal growth. It clearly depicts working class young adults who sought to break away from past barriers and limitations and build better lives for themselves. It is a coming of age story, where a full spectrum of feelings are explored as young adults learn about fulfilling their potential, building value systems and attempting to fulfill personal desires with honesty and integrity on many levels. Two hot young stars were cast in the leading roles: Richard Gere who was riding high on his recent success in ""American Gigolo"" and Debra Winger who shined in her role in ""Urban Cowboy"". With stars of this caliber, it surprised me to learn (in the Special Features section) that doubts existed about the film's acceptance by theater audiences. In fact, the script had made the rounds of different studios for eight years, with no one daring to make the film which was essentially about training Naval pilots. The concern was it was too close to the end of the Viet Nam War and would be rejected by the public as being about war. Luckily, the film was interpreted very differently by the viewing audience who saw it in a positive light where personal survival, transformation and the expression of love were the key elements successfully played out on film.Richard Gere stars as Zack Mayo, a hardened, slightly rebellious loner who locked up his feelings and dared not get emotionally close to people. He had been hurt as a youth when his mother committed suicide and he went to live with his dad, who was a selfish womanizer and alcoholic. When Zack announced his acceptance into Naval candidacy school to become a pilot, his father did not give him accolades or support. This was nothing new and it did not matter to Zack who pursued his dream with determination and courage. At the Port Townsend Naval Base, Zack learned discipline and made new friends. The camaraderie of being candidates and challenging themselves to acheive their goals awakened something new within him which totally transformed him. Zack excelled in physical survival skills and martial arts training. It was Gunnery Sergeant Foley's job to detect weakness of character and courage, to eliminate candidates who would not survive under the harsh conditions of war. Foley knew of Zack's streetwise rebellious tendencies and rode him hard. Foley and Zack clashed periodically and one climactic scene especially stood out ... where Foley meted out severe discipline and punishment to get Zack to ask for a ""D.O.R"" slip (drop out on request). Zack endured the punishment and after a particularly difficult session of physical endurance tests, Zack *finally* gut wrenchingly admitted, ""I got nowhere else to go"" ...Besides the obvious story about a group of young adults who under go rigorous training to become Naval pilots, several other stories arise and are fully developed within the plot which makes this film so highly appealing. Early on, Sgt Foley warned the candidates that young ladies who work in local factories, come from across the Puget Sound, to meet Naval candidates, with one goal in mind: to marry a Navy pilot. They will stoop to any means to win their man. Zack and his friend Sid are dressed to kill in their white uniforms during a social dance where they connect with two charming and beautiful factory workers of similar age to themselves. Paula a raven-haired beauty, played by Deborah Winger is paired with Zack, while Lynette, an attractive blond is paired with Sid. The attraction between the paired off guys and ladies is mutual and in a short time, they often meet for consensual physical liasons, even going to a local motel when the candidates are on leave. While everyone agrees it is with ""no strings attached"", the ladies have secret agendas with hopes of marriage. Zack attempts to play the gentleman, by going to meet Paula's parents and have dinner at their home. However, he still holds back and makes no promises to Paula. Paula plays it cool, claiming to expect nothing but she *does* manage to melt his cool exterior when their physical relationship becomes more steamy and personal. The guys discuss their plans to break off the liasons after graduation. As the end of their training is near, the two candidates cool their relationships with the two ladies. Lynette pulls a trick to win Sid, that backfires in ways totally unimaginable. She refuses Sid's engagement ring which results in one of the saddest, most gut-wrenching, heart-breaking and realistic scenes ever depicted on film. This earth-shattering event shakes Zack up and makes him realize what is real and important in his life ... While the ending may arguably be interpreted by some as corny and hokey, in effect, it is very satisfying and provides an honest and fulfilling conclusion to the film.

What's more you add to that the bad character of the salvaged hero at the beginning and his complete transformation into a good man, a good heart and a fair mind that will not play around and will finally do what his conscience tells him to do and his hormones force him to fall into. And what's more, the film avoids the dire tragic tone of all the rewritings of Romeo and Juliet.

211659,AQ01Q3070LT29,6300214222,James McDonald,"[4, 5]","Richard Gere had done some brilliant work in earlier films, Report To The Commissioner (1975), Looking For Mr. Goodbar (1977), Yanks (1979) and American Gigolo (1980), just to name a few.  But this film is probably the biggest breakthrough for Richard Gere. After  An Officer And A Gentleman was released, Gere was offered more mature roles and he hasn't stopped working since.  This film is everybody's favorite and the most watchable.  How many times can you say you have watched this film?  Everyone in the cast is perfect for the role they play.  And I still believe that Richard Gere and Debra Winger had screen chemistry.  What a brilliant cast!  Richard Gere, Robert Loggia, Louis Gossett Jr, David Keith, Tony Plana, Lisa Blout, Lisa Eilbacher, David Caruso, Grace Zabriske and Victor French.  I think congratulations should go to Tommy Petersen, who played &quot;Young Zack&quot;, for making his role memorable too.  I recall Lisa Eilbacher telling on a talk show that one deleted scene was her eating a bug as part of a survival test.  This DVD unfortunatly does not contain any deleted scenes, but it does have a wonderful Audio Commentary by Director Taylor Hackford.  If you have seen this film many times before, go ahead and turn on the Audio Commentary.  A lot of tidbits and filmmaking secrets will be shared with you by Taylor Hackford.  Debra Winger was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress, Louis Gossett Jr. won the Academy Award for Supporting Actor, the end credits music, &quot;Up Where We Belong&quot; won the Academy Award while the original score by Jack Nitzsche was only nominated.  The film itself was nominated for Writing--Screenplay written directly for the screen, and was nominated for Film Editing.  1982 was a good year for films, a lot of good quality films and it made a tough year for the Academy to choose and vote.  Unfortunatly, An Officier And A Gentleman didn't even get a nomination for Best Picture and Best Director and Richard Gere was not nominated either.

Suffering from the after-effects of his mother's suicide and life with an indifferent father, Zack decides that the Navy would make a good career choice.  Plus, he's always wanted to fly jets.The first person Zack meets after arriving on base is Gunnery Sergeant Emil Foley (Louis Gossett, Jr.).  Foley is a tough, hard-nosed drill instructor who takes nothing from recruits.  He pushes them both physically and mentally, but he wants the recruits to succeed.  During the course of the movie, Foley and Zack develop a somewhat rocky relationship, but each man respects the other.  Ultimately, Foley ends up playing a major role in Zack's life.Also present is Sid Worley (David Keith), another officer candidate whom Zack befriends.  Together, the two meet two local girls: Paula (Debra Winger) and Lynette (Lisa Blount).  Foley cautioned the group about the local women and their desire to snag a husband, but Foley's warning didn't stop Zack and Sid.  Soon, the foursome is spending all of their available time together.  Zack and Paula begin to have feelings for each other, but Zack is reluctant to commit to her based on his past.  Meanwhile, Lynette and Sid's relationship has taken a different turn.  Sid is falling in love with Lynette, but she's not sure how she feels about him.  To complicate matters further, Lynette announces she's pregnant.  Unsure of what to do, Sid D.O.R.'s in the 12th week of training, hoping to marry Lynette and move back to Oklahoma.  However, Lynette has no intentions of marrying Sid, instead saying she wants to marry a pilot and live overseas.  Devastated, Sid leaves, and the upcoming consequences are terrible for all involved.Zack and the rest of his class manage to survive Foley's training and graduate to the next step of their careers.  Along the way, Zack has learned the value of friendship and sacrificing personal gains in order to help others.  Zack and Paula's relationship has remained somewhat up in the air, but Zack goes to the factory where she works and carries her in his arms out the door, to the cheers of the other workers.This is a very good movie.  Richard Gere is very good in his role as Zack, but the film really belongs to Louis Gossett, Jr.  His portrayal of the hard-nosed Foley is truly the highlight of the film.  The story is devised very well, too.  I enjoyed watching the relationship among Zack, Paula, Sid, and Lynette develop, and the story about the training the recruits went through is good as well.I recommend this movie very highly.

The film is riddled with cliche'd and oft-used premises and the ending is overly sentimental (when other films have attempted the same thing, I've absolutely cringed).  But none of that matters. With remarkable and raw performances, ""Officer"" taps into a primal nerve and makes even the most familiar movie formulas seem fresh and vital. I'll make no apologies, I think ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" is one terrific film!Richard Gere stars as Zach Mayo, a charming, rebellious, and somewhat amoral badboy. Improbably entering the Naval Academy in an attempt to become a pilot, he immediately clashes with Louis Gossett, Jr. as his supervisor. Learning about teamwork and friendship, his life is further complicated by a local girl (Debra Winger) looking to latch onto a promising future. The film alternates between Gere's progress at the Academy and his burgeoning romance with Winger, but it seems unlikely that either are a good fit. It's a classic story of reform, of overcoming adversity, of making the right choices to become a better person. But what might be mawkish and predictable comes alive with tremendously real performances!While Gossett won an Oscar as the imperious drill sergeant, and Winger was nominated--the film, in many ways, belongs to Richard Gere. Cunningly believable as the selfish antihero, his evolution throughout the film is remarkably genuine. With much energy and bravado, his performance should have garnered him a Best Actor nomination. In one of the film's most powerful moments, as he proclaims to Gossett that he has ""nowhere else to go,"" his emotion is so raw and all encompassing that I've never forgotten that scene. Gere commands the film so fully, it's interesting to compare it to the more subdued work of his later career. I'd also single out Lisa Blount as Winger's best friend. Cast in a somewhat villainous light, Blount expertly conveys the desperation and ambition of a woman doing whatever is necessary to improve her circumstances in life.The notoriously difficult (real life) relationship between Winger and Gere on this film proves once again that off-screen antics have little to do with on-screen magic. Channeling their hatred for one another, their romantic and sexual liaisons have a realistic power and aggression that is rare even today. Fierce and independent, these two literally crash together in unexpected but believable ways. Old fashioned, yet surprisingly modern, ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" is supremely entertaining. It will tug at your emotions, but it is never overly manipulative as it has earned our investment with its great characterizations! Highly recommended as drama, romance, or even as a character study, revisit ""Officer"" now that it has a more deserving DVD release.

I absolutely love the scene where Zach helps Segar walk the wall of the obstacle course, including watching the guys go wild with happiness over their triumph.Debra Winger is a good actress, and you have to hand it to both Gere and Winger that they could pull this movie off when their lack of rapport was legendary.  To be fair to Gere, Winger (at least at that time) was known as a habitual problem child on the set of this and other movies.  I believe shortly after filming AOAAG she went into rehab.I enjoy this movie for a lot of reasons, but I would hate for young girls to watch this and think that the young women (Paula and Lynette) could be so easy and still get the guys in the end.  If Paula had had more self-esteem, she would not have allowed Zach to ""kiss it all better"" after behaving so badly toward her in the hotel room.Easy girls may get the guy for the short haul, but the Paulas and Lynettes are unlikely to form quality, lasting relationships with men that truly respect and value them.That said, we generally watch movies to escape and to be entertained, and overall this is a compelling, well-acted movie that I still watch from time to time.",4,"Good Movie, But Poor Guide to Dating",1224720000,"10 23, 2008",2008,1287,"['great', 'watch', 'young', 'buff', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'evolve', 'self-serving', 'bad', 'boy', 'caring', 'involved', 'friend', 'absolutely', 'love', 'scene', 'where', 'Zach', 'Segar', 'walk', 'wall', 'obstacle', 'course', 'including', 'watching', 'guys', 'go', 'wild', 'happiness', 'triumph.Debra', 'Winger', 'good', 'actress', 'have', 'hand', 'Gere', 'Winger', 'could', 'pull', 'movie', 'when', 'lack', 'rapport', 'was', 'legendary', 'be', 'fair', 'Gere', 'Winger', 'least', 'time', 'was', 'known', 'habitual', 'problem', 'child', 'set', 'other', 'movies', 'believe', 'shortly', 'filming', 'AOAAG', 'went', 'rehab.I', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'lot', 'reasons', 'would', 'hate', 'young', 'girls', 'watch', 'think', 'young', 'women', 'Paula', 'Lynette', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'easy', 'still', 'get', 'guys', 'end', 'Paula', 'had', 'had', 'more', 'self-esteem', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'allowed', 'Zach', 'kiss', 'better', 'behaving', 'so', 'badly', 'hotel', 'room.Easy', 'girls', 'may', 'get', 'guy', 'short', 'haul', 'Paulas', 'Lynettes', 'are', 'unlikely', 'form', 'quality', 'lasting', 'relationships', 'men', 'truly', 'respect', 'value', 'said', 'generally', 'watch', 'movies', 'escape', 'be', 'entertained', 'overall', 'compelling', 'well-acted', 'movie', 'still', 'watch', 'time', 'time']",An Officer and A Gentleman VHS

211687,A2TPPTGR4DIRL0,6300214222,Mitch Clifford,"[3, 15]","An officer and a gentleman tries to combine two plots:  1) a good-for-nothing tries to make it in the navy and  2) A romance between two people from different social standards.  These are two genres that CAN mix, but director Taylor Hackford just didn't succeed. In two hours, he showed 13 weeks of military training, a developing romance and character building. As I said before, this can be done, but Hackford just scratched the surface with every plot. He just took too little time to really show the essence of each plot. Hackford skips entire weeks and that's what killed this movie. If he stuck with 1 story (the navy one would be the best if you ask me), he probably would have made a great movie. Trying to stuff the movie with plots is not the only mistake Hackford made. His choice of actors was another. Richard Gere wasn't really at his best here. He just overacted too obvious. The scene where Mayo said the famous line ""I've got nowhere else to go"" was clearly overacted. A couple of minutes before that, Mayo said ""I ain't gonna quit"".

Along with rave reviews, 2 Oscars, 9 Golden Globe nominations, landing #29 on the AFI's 100 Years, 100 Passions, and grossing $127 million dollars in the U.S. alone, it remains one of the greatest films of all time. The story is about Zack Mayo (Richard Gere in arguably his best film role to date), a recent college graduate who wants to get away from his skirt-chasing father. His mother committed suicide when Zack was rather young, and ever since then he has lived with his father and therefore, has an attitude problem and a difficult time trusting people. When he enrolls in the Navy where he meets his match, his drill instructor (played by Oscar winner Louis Gosset Jr.) who teaches him, maybe not in the most pleasant way, dicipline and that no man can survive alone. Zack knows how to get things, which lands him into trouble with his drill instructor but refused to D.O.R.. His determination keeps him in school. At a party, he and his first real friend Sid (played by David Keith in his breakthrough and Golden Globe nominated role) meet two friends, Paula (played to her first of three Oscar nominations, the amazing Debra Winger) and Lynette (played by Lisa Blount, in her Golden Globe nominated role). While Sid and Lynette get right to it and sleep together on their first date, Zack and Paula take it slow, and true love blossoms. Paula teaches Zack that it is alright to love someone, but Lynette isn't as honest. This beautiful film about life, loss, and love concludes with a gorgeous end scene.When I first rented it, I was blown away by it and it quickly joined my top five list, along with DONNIE DARKO, LITTLE WOMEN, SAY ANYTHING..., and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. I strongly agree with anyone who says that Richard Gere should have gotten an Oscar (or at least a nomination) for his role. Debra Winger earned herself a well-deserved Oscar nomination, but it was obvious that Meryl Streep was going to win. Louis Gosset Jr. won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor and the song ""UP WHERE WE BELONG"" won for Best Origonal Song.

Though the premise is one often seen from Hollywood, ""Officer"" is a rich and often sad romantic journey filled with raw emotions and powerful performances by everyone involved. It is truly a well written (Douglas Day Stewart), well directed story (Taylor Hackford) with an all-star cast and it proves it!Zach Mayo, played by Richard Gere, is an adorably rebellious, often charming, and cocky Navy brat who enters the Naval Academy with hopes of become a pilot. Almost immediately, he clashes with drill Sgt. Foley, his immediate commanding officer played by Louis Gossett, Jr.. While learning about teamwork, friendship, and fitting in, his life is rapidly complicated by a local factory worker, Paula, (played by Academy Award Winner Debra Winger) looking to find an attractive young officer with a promising future and a way out of town. The film alternates between Gere's progress at the Academy, his ability to be a loyal friend and his blossoming romance. For a while it seems unlikely that either will work out longterm. It's a classic story of over-coming adversity, struggling to do the right thing, and learning to make the right decisions to become a better person. It comes across as very true-to-life and believable with tremendously real performances!Breathtakingly believable as a selfish, angry and somewhat lost young man, Richard Gere takes us on a roller coaster ride of character development that is stunningly real. I was honestly surprised he didn't receive a nomination for best actor for this performance, hands down one of his best to date. Debra Winger was nominated for Best Supporting Actress while Lou Gossett, Jr. won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his role as the dunting drill sergeant who manages to make a real man and an officer out of Zach Mayo. David Keith in the role of Sid Worley, Zach' best friend, also shines in a moving and ultimately heart breaking performance of his own. Rounding out the cast, Lisa Blount in the role of Paula's white trash best friend did a formidable job of conveying the utter desperation and hopelessness that leads a certain type of woman to do whatever it takes to marry up in life.""An Officer and a Gentleman"" is an intense romance/drama filled with a chemistry seldom seen with such startling realism (despite the supposed conflict between Gere & Winger off camera). The energy and sexual intensity are exactly what great romance is made of. It will make you laugh, make you cry, make you angry and make you sigh. And by the time you reach the end, it will have you cheering. Will anyone who has seen it ever forget the moment Zach sweeps Paula into his arms and marches her out of that humdrum factory life to live happily ever after?

211705,A1OOYXSUI4Z943,6300214222,"""sideshowmatthew""","[3, 4]","""An Officer and a Gentleman"" is a wonderful story about a man named Zack Mayo who zoins the navy, although his alcoholic father disagrees with his decision. Zack (played marvelously by Richard Gere) really doesn't care about anyone else but himself at first. He even gets into some unethical scheme at the navy. Sergeant Foley (flawlessly potrayed by Louis Gosset Jr.) can see right through Zack ""Mayo-Naisse"" and he endeavors to break Zack until he finally quits. Zack can't quit, he won't. Because of Foley's mind manipulations, Zack learns a little bit about being a better person. He also meets a good friend at the navy. And, he meets a girl walking past the naval camp whom he thinks is hot. The girl, Paula (played excellently by Debra Winger) sees Zack again at a party, and the two hook up. First, they like each other in a cute way, and a sex-related way, but the passion they feel for each other escalates into a meaningful relationship. The ending is uplifting and romantically brilliant! An ultimate fantasy of happiness and love. The musical score perfectly fits the mood, and the original song played during the ending credits, ""Up Where We Belong"", by Joe Cocker, is lovely.

They had a pretty low budget to contend with and the Navy did not cooperate.  Consequently the director had to have his crew build the pool dunking device from the plans, which played a key role in the film.  Fortunately the Marine Corps provided their support.  The results are great.  It was interesting to hear that at the graduation scene it was actually raining (which you can't really detect while watching the film.)  When everyone sat down into a small pool of water that had collected in their chairs there was apparently a collective groan from the crowd.

211709,A2H3JURQZOHVMB,6300214222,"Stella Carrier ""joyfulwoman2078""","[2, 2]","Richard Gere gives a very natural and fantastic performance as Zachary Mayo. Zachary goes through many challenges and tests of emotional and physical endurance on his way to becoming a naval officer via navy officer candidate school. He ends up becoming close friends with another fellow officer candidate named Sid Worley (well played by David Keith). Both Zach and Sid also meet and fall in love during their time in training. Zach's love interest Paula is played by Debra Winger. Sid's love interest Lynette is played by Lisa Blount. Louis Gossett Jr. plays a Marine Gunnery Sargeant by the name of Emil, who is a drill instructor tasked with shaping the officer candidates into leaders. I felt an urge to watch the movie because I use to be in the navy, and I was curious to get an idea of what it might be like for a soon to be officer going through bootcamp compared to the process of an enlisted person through bootcamp (I honorably served in the enlisted ranks from June 2000 until May 2009). The movie itself only takes place in one location, but I did enjoy how the characters forged special friendships and implied the traveling adventures that were going to take place once they graduated from officer candidate school (I appreciate the travel and the many wonderful friends that I met while I was in the navy).  The only caveat that I had with the movie was how some of the women were portrayed. The main female characters were beautiful but were depicted as women whose only chance at making something of themselves in life depended the long term plans of their male partners. In real life (in and outside of the military) many women have unlimited potential to achieve whatever they want regardless of their romantic status (it would have been nice if the movie would have portrayed the women as being poised for success regardless of what happens in their romantic lives). I understand that this movie was made in the early 80's before many more women became naval officers. I just wish that they would have showed a more personal romantic life of the one female officer candidate in the school as well as the men that were featured. I only say this because (over a month ago) I currently ran across an article in both airforce times and navy times that told how there is a high rate of military female veterans committing suicide, and one of the reasons cited was the fact that many of these veterans were not acknowledged for having done legitimate military service due to them being women, and as a result feelings of isolation resulted. I myself do not endorse or condone suicide because I appreciate being alive regardless of external circumstances that may appear, but I have empathy and compassion for those who do (whether military or civilian). Officer and a Gentleman is a fantastic movie, but it would be nice if more movies were featured that highlighted the personal lives of military female officers so that more members of the general public can see how both men and women make a positive contribution to our all volunteer military. Aside from my personal rant, I still highly recommend this movie as one to watch especially if you are open to seeing one of many ways of how a military person balances their personal and professional life in an interesting manner.",5,An Interesting Glimpse of the Military Officer Life,1295654400,"01 22, 2011",2011,3295,"['Richard', 'Gere', 'very', 'natural', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'Zachary', 'Mayo', 'Zachary', 'many', 'challenges', 'tests', 'emotional', 'physical', 'endurance', 'way', 'becoming', 'naval', 'officer', 'navy', 'officer', 'candidate', 'school', 'up', 'becoming', 'close', 'friends', 'fellow', 'officer', 'candidate', 'named', 'Sid', 'Worley', 'well', 'played', 'David', 'Keith', 'Zach', 'Sid', 'also', 'meet', 'fall', 'love', 'time', 'training', 'Zach', 'love', 'interest', 'Paula', 'played', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'Sid', 'love', 'interest', 'Lynette', 'played', 'Lisa', 'Blount', 'Louis', 'Gossett', 'Jr.', 'Marine', 'Gunnery', 'Sargeant', 'name', 'Emil', 'who', 'drill', 'instructor', 'tasked', 'shaping', 'officer', 'candidates', 'leaders', 'felt', 'urge', 'watch', 'movie', 'use', 'be', 'navy', 'was', 'curious', 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'soon', 'be', 'officer', 'going', 'bootcamp', 'compared', 'process', 'enlisted', 'person', 'bootcamp', 'honorably', 'served', 'enlisted', 'ranks', 'June', '2000', 'May', '2009', 'movie', 'only', 'place', 'one', 'location', 'did', 'enjoy', 'how', 'characters', 'forged', 'special', 'friendships', 'implied', 'traveling', 'adventures', 'were', 'going', 'take', 'place', 'once', 'graduated', 'officer', 'candidate', 'school', 'appreciate', 'travel', 'many', 'wonderful', 'friends', 'met', 'was', 'navy', 'only', 'caveat', 'had', 'movie', 'was', 'how', 'women', 'were', 'portrayed', 'main', 'female', 'characters', 'were', 'beautiful', 'were', 'depicted', 'women', 'only', 'chance', 'making', 'something', 'life', 'depended', 'long', 'term', 'plans', 'male', 'partners', 'real', 'life', 'military', 'many', 'women', 'have', 'unlimited', 'potential', 'achieve', 'want', 'regardless', 'romantic', 'status', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'portrayed', 'women', 'being', 'poised', 'success', 'regardless', 'what', 'romantic', 'lives', 'understand', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'early', '80', 'many', 'more', 'women', 'became', 'naval', 'officers', 'just', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'showed', 'more', 'personal', 'romantic', 'life', 'one', 'female', 'officer', 'candidate', 'school', 'as', 'well', 'men', 'were', 'featured', 'only', 'say', 'because', 'month', 'currently', 'ran', 'article', 'airforce', 'times', 'navy', 'times', 'told', 'how', 'high', 'rate', 'military', 'female', 'veterans', 'committing', 'suicide', 'one', 'reasons', 'cited', 'was', 'fact', 'many', 'veterans', 'were', 'not', 'acknowledged', 'having', 'done', 'legitimate', 'military', 'service', 'due', 'being', 'women', 'result', 'feelings', 'isolation', 'resulted', 'do', 'not', 'endorse', 'condone', 'suicide', 'appreciate', 'being', 'alive', 'regardless', 'external', 'circumstances', 'may', 'appear', 'have', 'empathy', 'compassion', 'who', 'do', 'military', 'civilian', 'Officer', 'Gentleman', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'more', 'movies', 'were', 'featured', 'highlighted', 'personal', 'lives', 'military', 'female', 'officers', 'so', 'more', 'members', 'general', 'public', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'men', 'women', 'make', 'positive', 'contribution', 'volunteer', 'military', 'Aside', 'personal', 'rant', 'still', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'one', 'watch', 'especially', 'are', 'open', 'seeing', 'one', 'many', 'ways', 'how', 'military', 'person', 'balances', 'personal', 'professional', 'life', 'interesting', 'manner']",An Officer and A Gentleman VHS
211710,A3A4LBT28FF22I,6300214222,Sugafoot,"[1, 1]","Look closely this is not a movie about the military but about life. More specifically about being lucky enough to find one self when you're young. A movie about status, social mobility, class, relationships, troubled young men and women, suicide, and love.This is  also about the card game as Ernest Hemingway would have described it that is played out between men and women whereby men attempt to seduce women and women wish to be valued for more than as prostitutes. And how some times that game can end in true love, but some times it can unleash forces beyond our control that can even kill.The main protagonist is Mayo played by Richard Geer. A navy brat with a troubled history.Who's not a team player because he's been hustled for so long and hustling for so long that he doesn't know when to recognize in life when you can start trusting people. His best friend is played by David Keith as Sid Sorley a troubled kid who has all sorts of emotional baggage who begins swimming in the deep end of the pool called the game of love before he's even aware of it. As we will find out later this has tragic results.I'm not afraid to admit that I began to tear up as I saw where this movie was headed. Sid Sorley is a great kid. He's an all American kid who got carried away having what began as a sexual vacation. Young-men who are immature are known to do this. What I found especially tragic is that the women who wants to marry him and whom he later is willing to give up everything for both carry a common psychic scar. They both lost sibling in the Vietnam war. Sid a nice kid is unwilling to open up about this as well as other emotional problems hes having.This is very sad to me because medical as well as testimonial evidence is now coming to light that shows that the families and children of veterans of not just the Vietnam war but possibly all wars some times inherit emotional scars from their families service to our country. If you don't believe me check out a book titled, 30 months with my father, by the daughter of a Vietnam vet and visit her website. I must admit I just found out about this book a few days ago and look forward to reading it I may up date this review after reading this book.I teared up as I saw the inevitable closing in around Sid Sorley. Military bases must have there share of young men and women like him. Kids really who have an emotional roller coaster in their heads cascading out of control that threatens to destroy them. And they have no one to trust no one to talk to. They must feel so emotionally stranded, so hopeless, so alone. The darkness chasing after them wanting to grasp them in it's eternal embrace. And the hart breaking thing is that they are the best and the brightest we have as a society to offer.I felt greatly for Sid Sorley he just wanted to be loved for who he was he was an emotionally damaged kid. who commits suicide. Sadly, suicide in our society is completely misunderstood. People think that it is the act of a coward. An act of volition. It isn't suicide occurs according to the medical data in people who have 95% of the time a preexisting mental illness. Their are chemicals in the brain and spinal column that if they ever dip below a certain level anyone no matter how tough you think they are, how religious, disciplined, will begin to have suicidal thoughts. This is why I ached as I saw Sorley hurt so much for no good resason. Modern medicne now has medications which prevent this from happening. Theirs therapy. I wept as Sorley needlessly killed himself how easily it could have been avoided if he had just been under the care of a professional.But this movie is to some extent about the redeeming power of true love the love felt between Richard Geer's character and the beautiful girl next door female lead. I cheered as I'm sure you  did when he swept her up and carried her away like some dime store romance novel hero. Mayo who has emotional issues do to the suicide of his mother, his raising and intimacy issues do to being raised 'on top of the raunciest whore house in the Philipine Island.' Overcomes his issues and shows maturity in sweeping his love away.But that's not even my favorite scene. Mine is when Geer wakes up after a night of love making and find his now girlfriend making breakfast in the kitchen. This demonstrates that love is not always an epic quest depicted in romance movies or novels. It is for more ordinary people, well, more ordinary waking up and realizing that some one cares for you because they made breakfast. I love the conversation that ensues in that scene that was when they had both stopped playing cards and were really falling in love. This is a wonderful movie.

Gunnery Sgt. Emil Foley(Lou Gossett, Jr.) who trains him, but tries to make him an outcast by hazing him trying to get Zach to DOR, despite Zach's refusal to quit the Navy along with the fact that this films title used an old expression from the British Royal Navy and subsequently from the U.S. Uniform Code of Military Justice as being charged with ""conduct unbecoming an officer & a gentleman from 1860.AN OFFICER & A GENTLEMAN starts out with Zach living with his alcoholic Navy boatswain's mate Bryon Mayo(Robert Loggia)whom Zach has been living with since his early adolescence after his mother commited suicide, so by hoping to put his life on a different path, Zach joins the Navy.Eventually Zach & his Navy buddy Sid Worley(David Keith)meet 2 local ladies at a Navy-hosted dance which are factory workers Paula Pokrifki(Debra Winger)& Lynette Pomeroy(Lisa Blount)with whom each begins a romantic relationship with.Therefore, that song ""Up Where We Belong"" by Joe Cocker always makes me think of this movie, since it was released around the same time as that song was.Richard Gere and Debra Winger were a hot and cute looking couple, especially in their sexy touching lovemaking scene in the middle of the movie showing Winger & Gere in bed together in total nudity showing us everything, but Wingers coochie and Gere's pee pee, which reminds me that Richard Gere always seemed to have a way of getting his main female co-stars into bed in most of his movies back in the 1980's, but I guess that's another thing that made Gere a sex symbol back in the 80's.This DVD also has bonus features showing the director(Taylor Hackford) and co-stars from AN OFFICER & A GENTLEMAN 25 years later talking about their experience & memories while filming this movie back in 1982, but I don't know whatever happened to Debra Winger and I don't understand is why didn't they show Debra Winger talking about her experience doing AN OFFICER & A GENTLEMAN in the bonus features, especially since Debra Winger was one of the main co-stars in this movie.This movie takes me all the way back to memory lane when AN OFFICER & A GENTLEMAN was released in theatres on Wednesday July 28, 1982 when we were still going through the recession we had back in 1981-1982 when Ronald Reagan was president which also takes me all the way back to my childhood years of when I was living in the Imperial Valley since I was living in my hometown(El Centro, CA)at the time when this drama flick was made and had amassed $129, 795, 554 at the box office in the Summer of 1982.So if you liked AMERICAN GIGOLO, BREATHLESS,

211713,A33FA68V0NCM5E,6300214222,TheIrrationalMan,"[1, 3]","One of the greatest films of the eighties, &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot; -- the tale of a raw recruit struggling to complete a  gruelling training program in an aviation academy -- combines impressive  performances from its stellar cast with a storyline exploring issues of  romance, friendship and the courage to survive. The relationship between  the recruit Zach Mayo (Richard Gere) and the tough gunnery seargeant Foley  (an unforgettable Louis Gosset Jr.) is the focus of the film. Foley warns  Mayo that he will be courting the local girls at his own risk, since some  may deliberately cause themselves to get pregnant in order to ensnare  budding aviators into marrying them. This theme is poignantly developed  when Mayo's best friend, played by David Keith, sacrifices his aviating  career for the sake of a girl who fakes her pregnancy to trap and deceive  him, leading to his tragic suicide. The dialogue between the two friends in  the mess room is one of the most absorbing scenses in the film. It makes a  significant point about individuality and responsibility. Mayo is the  clear-headed realist: he believes that one should always put his own  self-interest first and concern himself primarily with his own welfare, a  view which is opposed by his duty-bound and eventually love-crossed friend,  the kind-hearted loser whose morality gets the better of his sense. A very  uplifting film, with excellent support from Debra Winger as Mayo's love,  Paula. There is also an excellent musical score by Jack Nitzsche.",5,Highly watchable romantic drama,963619200,"07 15, 2000",2000,1537,"['One', 'greatest', 'films', 'eighties', 'quot', 'Officer', 'Gentleman', 'quot', 'tale', 'raw', 'recruit', 'struggling', 'complete', 'gruelling', 'training', 'program', 'aviation', 'academy', 'combines', 'impressive', 'performances', 'stellar', 'cast', 'storyline', 'exploring', 'issues', 'romance', 'friendship', 'courage', 'survive', 'relationship', 'recruit', 'Zach', 'Mayo', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'tough', 'gunnery', 'seargeant', 'Foley', 'unforgettable', 'Louis', 'Gosset', 'Jr.', 'focus', 'film', 'Foley', 'Mayo', 'will', 'be', 'courting', 'local', 'girls', 'own', 'risk', 'may', 'deliberately', 'cause', 'get', 'pregnant', 'order', 'ensnare', 'budding', 'aviators', 'marrying', 'theme', 'poignantly', 'developed', 'when', 'Mayo', 'best', 'friend', 'played', 'David', 'Keith', 'aviating', 'career', 'sake', 'girl', 'who', 'pregnancy', 'trap', 'deceive', 'leading', 'tragic', 'suicide', 'dialogue', 'two', 'friends', 'mess', 'room', 'one', 'most', 'absorbing', 'scenses', 'film', 'significant', 'point', 'individuality', 'responsibility', 'Mayo', 'clear-headed', 'realist', 'one', 'should', 'always', 'put', 'own', 'self-interest', 'first', 'concern', 'primarily', 'own', 'welfare', 'view', 'opposed', 'duty-bound', 'eventually', 'love-crossed', 'friend', 'kind-hearted', 'loser', 'morality', 'better', 'sense', 'very', 'uplifting', 'film', 'excellent', 'support', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'Mayo', 'love', 'Paula', 'also', 'excellent', 'musical', 'score', 'Jack', 'Nitzsche']",An Officer and A Gentleman VHS

As a child, he was sent to live with his father, a career Navy man based in the Philippines, after his mother commits suicide. There he soon realized that he had to be tough and rely on no one. After graduating from college, he shocks his father by telling that he has enlisted in the Navy and will enter training as a naval aviator. There he brings the same loner attitude he has had all of his life. He does however meet Paula, an attractive young woman who often attends base functions in the hope of nabbing a young officer and Sid Worley, a classmate with whom he forms a close bond. The training is difficult but not as tough as having to deal with their training officer, Gunnery Sergeant Emil Foley who teaches Zack a lesson in the importance of relying on your friends and colleagues.

211720,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,6300214222,Wuchak,"[1, 1]","Released in 1982, ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" was the obvious inspiration of films like Tom Cruise's ""Top Gun"" and ""Days of Thunder."" ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" was the first and best, by far.The plot similarities are obvious: They all include the angry young man who needs to prove his gifting, the uncompromising mentor, the encouraging babe, the craft, the arena and the doomed buddy. In ""An Officer"" the angry young man is Richard Gere as Mayo, the mentor is Louis Gossett Jr. as Drill Instructor Folely, the babe is Paula (Debra Winger), the craft is aviation basic training, the arena is a Naval academy and the Puget Sound area of Washington (shot on location) and the buddy is Sid Worley (David Keith).Thankfully, the film doesn't get bogged down telling the back-story of Mayo. Instead, it ingeniously shares his past in a matter of minutes at the very beginning. It's all we need to know to understand why Mayo is the way he is. And then we're off to basic training where he's tested. Does he have what it takes? Can someone as lowborn, aloof and un-trusting as Mayo make it as an officer?Debra Winger and Lisa Blount shine here as Mayo and Worley's babes. Winger is alluring in a humble ""girl next door"" type of way (she out-shined Lynda Carter as Wonder Girl on ""Wonder Woman,"" which is hard to believe), but Blount is even more alluring -- yes, despite the negative aspects of her character. I'll just put it this way, she really fills out a pair of jeans, lol.Both couples get intimate way too quickly, but maybe this is one of the flaws of the ""Puget Debs"" and explains why they have a problems getting marriage material, if you know what I mean. Besides this, time has to be condensed in a two-hour film.BOTTOM LINE: If you're in the mood for a film of this ilk ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" is the best of the lot.GRADE: AINSIGHTS ABOUT THE ENDING (***SPOILER ALERT*** Don't read further unless you've seen the film):An officer is a military leader. Drill Instructor Foley's job is to weed out those who can't hack it as an officer. It's an important job because people's lives in combat are dependent on the quality of the leaders and Foley takes his job seriously.Foley rightly pegs Mayo as a lowlife loner from the outset -- a wannabe officer -- and therefore puts on the pressure. This is especially so on the one weekend where he has Mayo to himself. Foley does everything he can to make Mayo break AND quit, but Mayo doesn't. He breaks, indeed, but he refuses to quit on the grounds that he has no where to go. At the end of this scene you can see that Foley develops respect for Mayo (which you get a glimpse of earlier when Mayo does extremely well on the obstacle course).Later, Mayo disregards breaking the record on the obstacle course (which he was definitely able to do) in order to encourage Seegar (the female recruit) to finally make it over the wall. Foley sees that Mayo's no longer the aloof and selfish loner he was when he rode in on his motorcycle. He's matured; he's developed character. It was already there, of course, but the boot camp training has brought it to the fore, and Foley sees it.After Worley's tragic death, Mayo confronts Foley while he's drilling the platoon. Foley informs Mayo that they all know what happened and even tells him they're sorry about Worley. He didn't have to do this and it shows that Foley isn't just an honorable man, but also that he cared about Worley. After all, Worley was only one week away from graduating! In a sense, he was one of Foley's kids. In other words, Foley and the platoon were grieving too. But Mayo was closest to Worley and he's crazy with shock & grief at this point. He insists that he's going to quit, to which Foley tells him to meet him for a fight. Sure, there's some testosterone in his words, but he actually does this out of respect for Mayo as a last ditch effort to keep him from dropping out.And Foley doesn't ""kick his axx"", as some claim. It was essentially an even match and Foley barely walks off the mat, which is the only reason he technically wins. But that's inconsequential. The purpose of the fight was to run Mayo's steam out so he didn't make a rash decision in an obvious moment of grief & anger. Foley accomplished his purpose. Once Mayo was no longer blinded by rage he makes the right choice and graduates.This is why he thanks Foley at the end.",5,The best of its kind,1390262400,"01 21, 2014",2014,4373,"['Released', '1982', 'Officer', 'Gentleman', 'was', 'obvious', 'inspiration', 'films', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Top', 'Gun', 'Days', 'Thunder', 'Officer', 'Gentleman', 'was', 'first', 'best', 'far.The', 'plot', 'similarities', 'are', 'obvious', 'include', 'angry', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'prove', 'gifting', 'uncompromising', 'mentor', 'encouraging', 'babe', 'craft', 'arena', 'doomed', 'buddy', 'Officer', 'angry', 'young', 'man', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Mayo', 'mentor', 'Louis', 'Gossett', 'Jr.', 'Drill', 'Instructor', 'Folely', 'babe', 'Paula', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'craft', 'aviation', 'basic', 'training', 'arena', 'Naval', 'academy', 'Puget', 'Sound', 'area', 'Washington', 'shot', 'location', 'buddy', 'Sid', 'Worley', 'David', 'Keith', '.Thankfully', 'film', ""n't"", 'get', 'bogged', 'down', 'telling', 'back-story', 'Mayo', 'Instead', 'ingeniously', 'shares', 'past', 'matter', 'minutes', 'very', 'beginning', 'need', 'know', 'understand', 'why', 'Mayo', 'way', 'then', ""'re"", 'basic', 'training', 'where', 'tested', 'have', 'what', 'Can', 'someone', 'lowborn', 'aloof', 'un-trusting', 'Mayo', 'make', 'officer', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'Lisa', 'Blount', 'shine', 'here', 'Mayo', 'Worley', 'babes', 'Winger', 'alluring', 'humble', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'type', 'way', 'out-shined', 'Lynda', 'Carter', 'Wonder', 'Girl', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'hard', 'believe', 'Blount', 'even', 'more', 'alluring', 'yes', 'negative', 'aspects', 'character', ""'ll"", 'just', 'put', 'way', 'really', 'out', 'pair', 'jeans', 'couples', 'get', 'intimate', 'way', 'too', 'quickly', 'maybe', 'one', 'flaws', 'Puget', 'Debs', 'why', 'have', 'problems', 'getting', 'marriage', 'material', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'time', 'be', 'condensed', 'two-hour', 'film.BOTTOM', 'LINE', ""'re"", 'mood', 'film', 'ilk', 'Officer', 'Gentleman', 'best', 'lot.GRADE', 'AINSIGHTS', 'THE', 'ENDING', '***SPOILER', 'ALERT***', 'Do', ""n't"", 'read', 'further', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'officer', 'military', 'leader', 'Drill', 'Instructor', 'Foley', 'job', 'weed', 'out', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hack', 'officer', 'important', 'job', 'people', 'lives', 'combat', 'are', 'dependent', 'quality', 'leaders', 'Foley', 'job', 'seriously.Foley', 'rightly', 'Mayo', 'lowlife', 'loner', 'outset', 'wannabe', 'officer', 'therefore', 'puts', 'pressure', 'especially', 'so', 'one', 'weekend', 'where', 'Mayo', 'Foley', 'everything', 'can', 'make', 'Mayo', 'break', 'AND', 'quit', 'Mayo', ""n't"", 'indeed', 'quit', 'grounds', 'where', 'go', 'end', 'scene', 'can', 'see', 'Foley', 'respect', 'Mayo', 'get', 'glimpse', 'earlier', 'when', 'Mayo', 'extremely', 'well', 'obstacle', 'course', '.Later', 'Mayo', 'disregards', 'breaking', 'record', 'obstacle', 'course', 'was', 'definitely', 'able', 'do', 'order', 'encourage', 'Seegar', 'female', 'recruit', 'finally', 'make', 'wall', 'Foley', 'Mayo', 'longer', 'aloof', 'selfish', 'loner', 'was', 'when', 'rode', 'motorcycle', 'matured', 'developed', 'character', 'was', 'already', 'there', 'course', 'boot', 'camp', 'training', 'brought', 'fore', 'Foley', 'sees', 'it.After', 'Worley', 'tragic', 'death', 'Mayo', 'confronts', 'Foley', 'drilling', 'platoon', 'Foley', 'informs', 'Mayo', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'even', 'tells', ""'re"", 'sorry', 'Worley', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'Foley', ""n't"", 'just', 'honorable', 'man', 'also', 'cared', 'Worley', 'Worley', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'week', 'away', 'graduating', 'sense', 'was', 'one', 'Foley', 'kids', 'other', 'words', 'Foley', 'platoon', 'were', 'grieving', 'too', 'Mayo', 'was', 'closest', 'Worley', 'crazy', 'shock', 'grief', 'point', 'going', 'quit', 'Foley', 'meet', 'fight', 'Sure', 'testosterone', 'words', 'actually', 'respect', 'Mayo', 'last', 'ditch', 'effort', 'keep', 'dropping', 'out.And', 'Foley', ""n't"", 'kick', 'axx', 'claim', 'was', 'essentially', 'even', 'match', 'Foley', 'barely', 'walks', 'off', 'mat', 'only', 'reason', 'technically', 'inconsequential', 'purpose', 'fight', 'was', 'run', 'Mayo', 'steam', 'out', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'rash', 'decision', 'obvious', 'moment', 'grief', 'anger', 'Foley', 'accomplished', 'purpose', 'Once', 'Mayo', 'was', 'longer', 'blinded', 'rage', 'right', 'choice', 'graduates.This', 'why', 'Foley', 'end']",An Officer and A Gentleman VHS
