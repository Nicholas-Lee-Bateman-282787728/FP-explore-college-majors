Not the crappy, straight to DVD portions of it, but 1, 2, American Wedding and this little gem.  Despite the gross-out gags and gratuitous nudity, the American Pie franchise is actually quite sweet and a very conservative heart beats underneath.  Good films versus great ones usually work out that way.  You think its about one thing, and it surprises you with depth.  When I first saw American Pie, I didn't want to go, thinking it would just be another vapid, teenage sex comedy.  I was dragged kicking and screaming (I wanted to see The Haunting) and it turned out to be a gem.  The other films have continued this funny but deep trend.

1469460,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B005LAIH9K,Chris Kennison,"[23, 25]","When ""American Pie"" came out in 1999 it was a box office smash. It was a movie that cost $10 million and banked over $235 million. That was enough to spawn two legit sequels and two not-so-legit sequels. The two legit sequels, ""American Pie 2"" & ""American Wedding"", in my opinion, failed to capture the magic of the first movie. ""American Pie"" was about high school kids, teen angst and sexual exploration but the thing that put it over the top was the honesty and truthfulness behind it. They weren't afraid to tackle taboo subjects, but they did it with honesty. The sequels relied too heavily on the angst and gross out jokes.Another thing ""American Pie"" did was make stars out of Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Alyson Hannigan, Shannon Elizabeth, Tara Reid and Seann William Scott. All of them rose to quick fame and some of them, Hannigan (How I Met Your Mother), have managed to hang onto that fame or increase it. Some of them have fallen right off the map, so it was a perfect time for a sequel and a return of the old cast. They are all back and sure, they all needed career boosts, but they also came back for good reason. The script for ""American Reunion"" is better and the audience that came to the original movie grew to love the characters.There are jokes that are rehashed from the original and the raunchy nature of the films is completely intact, but more importantly the writers remembered the truth and honesty that pushed ""American Pie"" over the hump.  Of course the laughs were important as well.The best part about ""American Reunion"" is that they gave veteran actor and SCTV alum, Eugene Levy (Splash, Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show), a big part in this one. Having been a widow for the past three years, he's content with his Sudoku and nights at home alone until his son returns for his 13-year class reunion. Once out of the house, he steals the show.""American Reunion"", much like the entire series, isn't for everyone. It is offensive and at times gross, but at the same time it manages to be poignant and truthful. It is an entertaining film with all the characters returning 13-years later in real life as well.

1469463,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B005LAIH9K,C. Sawin,"[6, 8]","It's hard to believe that American Wedding came out in 2003 and that there's a nine year gap between that movie and the latest installment American Reunion. I guess I was never that big of a fan of the first three movies. The first one was pretty good, but the two sequels were just kind of okay. They do probably deserve a revisit, but I was always more of a Van Wilder and Harold & Kumar fan. It's weird saying that because American Pie paved the way for not only those R-rated comedies, but basically every other one since then. Much like the characters in the movie, we've all grown up and moved on since Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle's (Alyson Hannigan) wedding. Maybe that's why there wasn't much anticipation on my end for American Reunion. That's kind of the beauty of the theatrically released American Pie movies; you always seem to under-anticipate them and they always deliver something that's better than you ever could have hoped for.American Reunion begins with the same scene that's at the beginning of the trailer and plays out in a similar fashion to that of Not Another Teen Movie's opening sequence, but with more member-crushing. Jim, Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) have plans to reunite in East Great Falls, Michigan for a guy's weekend before their thirteenth high school reunion. Everyone has moved on and either has a family now or an incredible job in another city except for Stifler (Seann William Scott) who's now a single temp at a law firm. With cameos and small roles for nearly every character you've grown to love over the span of the franchise, this is one weekend these friends will remember and cherish forever.American Reunion offers this huge slice of nostalgia as it seems like you know and have grown up along with these characters. While the raunchiness is still very much alive and well and results in some of the most memorable moments ever (the kitchen scene and Stifler getting back at the teenagers at the lake), American Reunion has just as much sentimental value as it does obscene humor. There's just as much emphasis on new and old relationships, drama between characters, and everlasting friendship that there is on jokes involving male genitalia and fecal matter. Some of the best moments of the movie are between Jim and his dad (Eugene Levy). They juggle between being really touching and downright hilarious due to their awkwardness.Perhaps it's because Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg (writers/directors of the three Harold & Kumar movies) came on board that American Reunion feels like a bit of a step up for the franchise. Well, anything probably is after the direct to DVD sequels. It almost seems like American Reunion manages to return to its roots while also offering a little bit more in the emotional department. It could just be I related to the movie since I often feel like I'm running in place career-wise much like these characters and that all my friends seem to be moving on and having families while I don't, but that only adds to the fact that this is a really entertaining adult comedy.

This movie brings back all of the characters that you came to know and love from the original which was amazing, as there had been a number of movies in the series that failed to live up to the comedic tone and value of the original (in my opinion). Be aware that this movie does have its crude humor in it so it is not appropriate for young audiences due to the humor and the overall content and message that it is sharing. That being said though, the movie was funny and the cast did a great job together again! I also loved all of the amazing extras that the Blu-Ray provides you as a viewer. There were so many fun games and interactive aspects of the disc that allow you to better know the characters and the actors playing them as well as what goes into the writing and directing if a movie such as this.

It delivers the same level of coarseness and immaturity that made American Pie such a hit combined with a somber and reflective tone that shows how all the characters have grown up. Not that this movie is in any way downbeat but there is a sense that 13 years on, all the raucousness of college has been replaced by life as a 30-something.Reunion brings back all the characters from the original with varying degrees of success. Vicky, Jessica and Heather's stories didn't have very far to go whereas Jim and Michelle, Oz and Finch had much better parts in the script. The stand-out role in the film is Stiffler, who carries the film through every scene he appears in - his one-dimensional, emotional tone-deafness is perfect for the non-stop hilarious one-liners.As with the first movie, the first 30 minutes set-ups all the gags for the payoff in the finale. They continue and develop most of the famously amusing scenes. It was great to see Eugene Levy given more screen time and Rebecca de Mornay has a funny cameo towards the end.After a few bumpy and forgettable sequels, American Reunion finally gives the audience something that's on par with the first.

And I'm referring to American Pie 2; the first in a set of unnecessary sequels, including four spin-offs. That the story continues to continue on, with an oddly-timed thirteen-year Reunion, thirteen years later, is a testament to the way the movie business works. It's not really about art. It's about money. So even moderately popular flicks spawn sequels almost automatically. That means this reunion just might be the first of more.When we met Jim Levenstein, he and his three best friends were high school seniors with a pact to lose their virginity before graduation. Now he's married with a kid, Kevin is married, Oz is a professional sportscaster and Finch... rides a motorcycle. But we shouldn't know any of this. Their stories should've ended with their high school graduation. The rest should've been left to our imaginations. Instead we get what feels like an extended epilogue; one that's long passed the length of the story itself.It is nice to see everybody again, particularly Stifler. He's not nearly as funny as he tries to be; the fake phone-call is the only thing he does that makes me laugh out loud; but his outrageousness makes him the funniest among semi-funny characters. It's just that the movie, as much as it tries with all its time-lapse jokes; Stifler pretends to read the Twilight series to connect with high school chicks and the Spice Girls Wannabe song now plays on the Classic Rock station; can only go so far on nostalgia alone.marcellee.com",2,2 of 5,1353628800,"11 23, 2012",2012,1556,"['Did', 'world', 'need', 'slice', 'American', 'Pie', 'answer', 'course', ""'m"", 'referring', 'American', 'Pie', '2', 'first', 'set', 'unnecessary', 'sequels', 'including', 'four', 'spin-offs', 'story', 'continue', 'oddly-timed', 'thirteen-year', 'Reunion', 'thirteen', 'years', 'later', 'testament', 'way', 'movie', 'business', 'works', 'not', 'really', 'art', 'money', 'So', 'even', 'moderately', 'popular', 'flicks', 'spawn', 'sequels', 'almost', 'automatically', 'reunion', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'first', 'more.When', 'met', 'Jim', 'Levenstein', 'three', 'best', 'friends', 'were', 'high', 'school', 'seniors', 'pact', 'lose', 'virginity', 'graduation', 'Now', 'married', 'kid', 'Kevin', 'married', 'Oz', 'professional', 'sportscaster', 'Finch', 'motorcycle', 'should', ""n't"", 'know', 'stories', 'should', ""'ve"", 'ended', 'high', 'school', 'graduation', 'rest', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'left', 'imaginations', 'Instead', 'get', 'what', 'feels', 'extended', 'epilogue', 'one', 'long', 'passed', 'length', 'story', 'itself.It', 'nice', 'see', 'everybody', 'again', 'particularly', 'Stifler', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'funny', 'be', 'fake', 'phone-call', 'only', 'thing', 'loud', 'outrageousness', 'funniest', 'semi-funny', 'characters', 'just', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'time-lapse', 'jokes', 'Stifler', 'read', 'Twilight', 'series', 'connect', 'high', 'school', 'chicks', 'Spice', 'Girls', 'Wannabe', 'song', 'now', 'Classic', 'Rock', 'station', 'can', 'only', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'nostalgia', 'alone.marcellee.com']",N/A

1469505,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005LAIH9K,Mark Turner,"[3, 3]","One of the first movies in the teen gross out genre was AMERICAN PIE. The movie was funny, had some jokes that a few people might find offensive and on the whole was quite entertaining. It was followed by a few lackluster sequels that never quite got the whole gang together again. So it's nice to see that everyone has come back for the reunion. AMERICAN REUNION that is.Believe it or not it's been 13 years since we the teens in the series graduated and moved on. Yes, we know that Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) and Jim (Jason Biggs) got married (one of the sequels). Jim works at a good job and they have a son now. What they don't have is an interesting sex life, the crux of their problem in this film.What's up with everyone else? Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is in love with a working woman and about ready to tie the knot himself. He works at home as an architect and the couple tend to do more things that interest her than him but he's content. Oz (Chris Klein) is a sports announcer in LA whose girlfriend seems to be far more off the beaten path than he might like. Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) is a mystery with rumors of him traveling the world. And Stiffler (Seann William Scott) remains Stiffler, the ever adolescent party man who works as a temp assistant to a tyrannical boss.All of these friends have kept in touch and seen one another from time to time, but this year they've decided to get together for their thirteenth class reunion. Not only that they're coming into town early to just get in touch with one another again. They omit Stiffler from the gathering but he finds his way to them anyway. And it's Stiffler that is the same as he was 13 years ago and who pulls them into their past.The set ups for various jokes work well into the storyline. Going to the beach they all enjoyed when they were teens they do what all responsible adults do, they get drunk. This leads to a prank Stiffler finds hilarious and the others consider a little immature.The little girl that Jim babysat while in high school is all grown up in every way imaginable and Jim can't believe his eyes. When she gets drunk at a party he takes her home only to have her hit on him. With the help of his friends he just might get her in the house without her parents finding him.A party Stiffler throws is not quite what he expected with people from work more suit and tie with a bottle of wine than T shirt and keg. His party seems boring until he gets things rolling. This sequence has one of the funniest yet grossest jokes in it.Misunderstandings and final reconciliations are in order and the movie does have a happy ending. No not one of THOSE happy endings although Jim's dad (Eugene Levy) does bring that up in a conversation. His story is one of the funniest as well as Jim's dad finds possible romance with Stiffler's mom. In any event there was never any doubt that the film would provide us with a happy ending and leave it open for another sequel and that might be a good thing. It's interesting to watch these teens grow into adults and see how they deal with one another as they change.Amazingly enough the center piece of the film is the life of Stiffler. He misses the old days and while he may have been a jerk to the rest of the characters, he actually loved them as well. They were important to him and meant something to him. On his own he has little to feel good about but with these friends in tow he finds that person that's been missing since graduation.The acting seen here is natural but then again these are characters that the actors should by now be very comfortable with. It's nice to see them reprise the roles that actually started some of their careers. Each one displays the character at a different time in their life and does it well.For me the clincher to these movies and to the gross out raunchy teen films in general is was I entertained? I can honestly say yes, this movie does indeed entertain. It made me laugh. It made me care for characters I hadn't watched in some time. It made me reminisce about my high school years as well. It's nice to see a movie that one would place in a niche category swing about and complete so many more. Don't sell this movie out. It's well worth taking the time to see.",4,PIE BAKED ONCE MORE,1342569600,"07 18, 2012",2012,4236,"['One', 'first', 'movies', 'teen', 'gross', 'genre', 'was', 'AMERICAN', 'PIE', 'movie', 'was', 'funny', 'had', 'jokes', 'few', 'people', 'might', 'find', 'offensive', 'whole', 'was', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'was', 'followed', 'few', 'lackluster', 'sequels', 'never', 'quite', 'got', 'whole', 'gang', 'together', 'again', 'nice', 'see', 'everyone', 'come', 'back', 'reunion', 'AMERICAN', 'REUNION', 'is.Believe', 'not', 'been', '13', 'years', 'teens', 'series', 'graduated', 'moved', 'Yes', 'know', 'Michelle', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'Jim', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'got', 'married', 'one', 'sequels', 'Jim', 'good', 'job', 'have', 'son', 'now', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'interesting', 'sex', 'life', 'crux', 'problem', 'film.What', 'up', 'everyone', 'else', 'Kevin', 'Thomas', 'Ian', 'Nicholas', 'love', 'working', 'woman', 'ready', 'tie', 'knot', 'home', 'architect', 'couple', 'tend', 'do', 'more', 'things', 'interest', 'content', 'Oz', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'sports', 'announcer', 'LA', 'girlfriend', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'beaten', 'path', 'might', 'like', 'Finch', 'Eddie', 'Kaye', 'Thomas', 'mystery', 'rumors', 'traveling', 'world', 'Stiffler', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'Stiffler', 'ever', 'adolescent', 'party', 'man', 'who', 'temp', 'assistant', 'tyrannical', 'boss.All', 'friends', 'have', 'kept', 'touch', 'seen', 'one', 'time', 'time', 'year', ""'ve"", 'decided', 'get', 'together', 'thirteenth', 'class', 'reunion', 'Not', 'only', ""'re"", 'coming', 'town', 'early', 'just', 'get', 'touch', 'one', 'again', 'omit', 'Stiffler', 'gathering', 'way', 'anyway', 'Stiffler', 'same', 'was', '13', 'years', 'ago', 'who', 'past.The', 'set', 'ups', 'various', 'jokes', 'work', 'well', 'storyline', 'Going', 'beach', 'enjoyed', 'when', 'were', 'teens', 'do', 'what', 'responsible', 'adults', 'do', 'get', 'drunk', 'prank', 'Stiffler', 'hilarious', 'others', 'consider', 'little', 'immature.The', 'little', 'girl', 'Jim', 'babysat', 'high', 'school', 'grown', 'up', 'way', 'imaginable', 'Jim', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'eyes', 'When', 'drunk', 'party', 'home', 'only', 'have', 'hit', 'help', 'friends', 'just', 'might', 'get', 'house', 'parents', 'finding', 'him.A', 'party', 'Stiffler', 'not', 'quite', 'what', 'expected', 'people', 'work', 'more', 'suit', 'tie', 'bottle', 'wine', 'T', 'shirt', 'keg', 'party', 'boring', 'things', 'rolling', 'sequence', 'one', 'funniest', 'yet', 'grossest', 'jokes', 'it.Misunderstandings', 'final', 'reconciliations', 'are', 'order', 'movie', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'not', 'one', 'THOSE', 'happy', 'endings', 'Jim', 'dad', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'bring', 'up', 'conversation', 'story', 'one', 'funniest', 'as', 'well', 'Jim', 'dad', 'possible', 'romance', 'Stiffler', 'mom', 'event', 'was', 'never', 'doubt', 'film', 'would', 'provide', 'happy', 'ending', 'leave', 'open', 'sequel', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'interesting', 'watch', 'teens', 'grow', 'adults', 'see', 'how', 'deal', 'one', 'change.Amazingly', 'enough', 'center', 'piece', 'film', 'life', 'Stiffler', 'old', 'days', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'jerk', 'rest', 'characters', 'actually', 'loved', 'as', 'well', 'were', 'important', 'meant', 'something', 'own', 'little', 'feel', 'good', 'friends', 'tow', 'person', 'been', 'missing', 'graduation.The', 'acting', 'seen', 'here', 'natural', 'then', 'again', 'are', 'characters', 'actors', 'should', 'now', 'be', 'very', 'comfortable', 'nice', 'see', 'reprise', 'roles', 'actually', 'started', 'careers', 'one', 'character', 'different', 'time', 'life', 'well.For', 'clincher', 'movies', 'gross', 'out', 'raunchy', 'teen', 'films', 'general', 'was', 'entertained', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'yes', 'movie', 'indeed', 'entertain', 'made', 'made', 'care', 'characters', 'had', ""n't"", 'watched', 'time', 'made', 'reminisce', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'as', 'well', 'nice', 'see', 'movie', 'one', 'would', 'place', 'niche', 'category', 'swing', 'complete', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'Do', ""n't"", 'sell', 'movie', 'out', 'well', 'worth', 'taking', 'time', 'see']",N/A

The first night the gang gets back together old feelings come back and new problems arrive. Just when you think things can't go worse...they do. I'm not sure the term growing up with this movie applies because the first one came out when I was in college, but that's what it felt like. I remember the first one being so amazingly funny and raunchy and unlike anything that had come out until then. Fast forward to today and if you re-watch that one it seems so tame and almost PG-13 compared to todays movies. What I noticed about this one first off is that besides being funny it had a lot more heart in it then the recent high school drinking movies. Also unlike most sequels being made long after the series stopped this one actually made sense to do one and the writing was actually pretty good. All that said this is still an ""American Pie"" movie meaning there are some over the top scenes and the gang gets into things that seem to get worse and worse. As usual the best scenes involve Jim's (Biggs) Dad (Levy) and actually Stiffler seemed more tame in this one then the others. I have to say though that the ending of this one was perfect.

Just saw the new movie yesterday(opening day release).Let me say that I thoroughly enjoyed American Reunion!What a story! A group of PALS that go through good times & bad times with Each Other & always are there for each other.Hillarious moments throughout the movie, plenty of jokes & many lines in this movie to relate/remember the past movies!Of course all of the Original Cast was back & each cast member kept in tune with their original roles.I like the fact that this movie in the series stayed True to the storyline, antics, characters & humor to the previous big 3 of American Pie, American Pie 2, and American Wedding!The script & writing was Perfect!It was never OVER THE TOP stupid jokes!I never got bored during this movie, and even though it could be considered a bit predictable at times, the story was sooooo goooood, it kept me on the edge of my seat & it had plenty of BIG surprises.Each character brought back so many AWESOME memories from the Original first 3 releases.Every actor played their respective roles to perfection!Each character showed characteristics of the younger days, but maturity of the older days...The movie is a bit raunchy, but it is AMERICAN PIE people, what else would you expect???If they changed the formula, it would Flop & not be good for the True fans!I give this movie an A+ and hope they make another one in the series!Thanks for reading my review!",5,American Reunion=10/10,1333756800,"04 7, 2012",2012,1610,"['So', 'been', 'years', 'last', 'release', 'series', 'least', 'what', 'recognize', 'last', 'release', 'series', 'american', 'wedding', 'hoping', 'wishing', 'praying', 'finally', 'got', 'wish', 'Just', 'saw', 'new', 'movie', 'yesterday', 'opening', 'day', 'release', 'say', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'American', 'Reunion', 'What', 'story', 'group', 'PALS', 'go', 'good', 'times', 'bad', 'times', 'Other', 'always', 'are', 'there', 'other.Hillarious', 'moments', 'movie', 'plenty', 'jokes', 'many', 'lines', 'movie', 'relate/remember', 'past', 'movies', 'course', 'Original', 'Cast', 'was', 'back', 'cast', 'member', 'kept', 'tune', 'original', 'roles.I', 'fact', 'movie', 'series', 'stayed', 'True', 'storyline', 'antics', 'characters', 'humor', 'previous', 'big', '3', 'American', 'Pie', 'American', 'Pie', '2', 'American', 'Wedding', 'script', 'writing', 'was', 'Perfect', 'was', 'never', 'THE', 'TOP', 'stupid', 'jokes', 'never', 'got', 'bored', 'movie', 'even', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'bit', 'predictable', 'times', 'story', 'was', 'sooooo', 'goooood', 'kept', 'edge', 'seat', 'had', 'plenty', 'BIG', 'surprises.Each', 'character', 'brought', 'back', 'so', 'many', 'AWESOME', 'memories', 'Original', 'first', '3', 'releases.Every', 'actor', 'played', 'respective', 'roles', 'perfection', 'character', 'showed', 'characteristics', 'younger', 'days', 'maturity', 'older', 'days', 'movie', 'bit', 'raunchy', 'AMERICAN', 'PIE', 'people', 'what', 'else', 'would', 'expect', 'changed', 'formula', 'would', 'Flop', 'not', 'be', 'good', 'True', 'fans', 'give', 'movie', 'A+', 'hope', 'make', 'one', 'series', 'Thanks', 'reading', 'review']",N/A

Not as good as the first two, much more dirty (in language and inuendos) than the first two movies. Really degrading to young women.Movie shows what really happens to people who don't get a real life and keep going to these totally unnecessary high school reunions.
