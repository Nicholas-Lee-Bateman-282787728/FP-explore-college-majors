Q'orianka Kilcher did a very good job of portraying the princess and her part in the struggle as the Hawaiian nation was taken over and colonized.

1339263,A1O9BT8V9SQL3V,B003EYVXRS,AfroAmericanHeritage,"[8, 10]","Watch the special features first...you will have a much better understanding of the story behind the film. The film basically uses the history as a mere backdrop to a love story which may or may not have even happened...lots of lush scenery, lofty music, lovers canoodling in the mists, etc.I have mixed feelings about that. Perhaps the promise of a tried-and-true formula will get better reviews and draw more people to the movie; after all, not many theater goers want to be confronted with the fact that ""our"" 50th state (like so many Indian lands) was stolen.  So the movie presents it with a spoonful of sugar and people will be edified whether that was their intention or not.President Clinton signed Public Law 103-150, the ""Apology Resolution"" to Native Hawaiians, on November 23, 1993.Whereas, prior to the arrival of the first Europeans in 1778, the Native Hawaiian people lived in a highly organized, self-sufficient, subsistent social system based on communal land tenure with a sophisticated language, culture, and religion;Whereas, from 1826 until 1893, the United States recognized the independence of the Kingdom of Hawaii, extended full and complete diplomatic recognition to the Hawaiian Government, and entered into treaties and conventions with the Hawaiian monarchs to govern commerce and navigation...Whereas, on January 14, 1893... the United States Minister assigned to the sovereign and independent Kingdom of Hawaii conspired with a small group of non-Hawaiian residents of the Kingdom of Hawaii, including citizens of the United States, to overthrow the indigenous and lawful Government of Hawaii;Whereas, soon thereafter, when informed of the risk of bloodshed with resistance, Queen Liliuokalani issued the following statement yielding her authority to the United States Government rather than to the Provisional Government:""I Liliuokalani, by the Grace of God and under the Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom, Queen, do hereby solemnly protest against any and all acts done against myself and the Constitutional Government of the Hawaiian Kingdom by certain persons claiming to have established a Provisional Government of and for this Kingdom.""That I yield to the superior force of the United States of America whose Minister Plenipotentiary, His Excellency John L. Stevens, has caused United States troops to be landed a Honolulu and declared that he would support the Provisional Government.""Now to avoid any collision of armed forces, and perhaps the loss of life, I do this under protest and impelled by said force yield my authority until such time as the Government of the United States shall, upon facts being presented to it, undo the action of its representatives and reinstate me in the authority which I claim as the Constitutional Sovereign of the Hawaiian Islands.""- Queen Liliuokalani, Jan 17, 1893Whereas, without the active support and intervention by the United States diplomatic and military representatives, the insurrection against the Government of Queen Liliuokalani would have failed for lack of popular support and insufficient arms.Whereas, in a message to Congress on December 18, 1893, President Grover Cleveland reported fully and accurately on the illegal acts of the conspirators, described such acts as an ""act of war, committed with the participation of a diplomatic representative of the United States and without authority of Congress"", and acknowledged that by such acts the government of a peaceful and friendly people was overthrown... President Cleveland further concluded that a ""substantial wrong has thus been done which a due regard for our national character as well as the rights of the injured people requires we should endeavor to repair"" and called for the restoration of the Hawaiian monarchy.Whereas, the indigenous Hawaiian people never directly relinquished their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people or over their national lands to the United States, either through their monarchy or through a plebiscite or referendum.Whereas, the health and well-being of the Native Hawaiian people is intrinsically tied to their deep feelings and attachment to the land;Whereas, the long-range economic and social changes in Hawaii over the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries have been devastating to the population and to the health and well-being of the Hawaiian people;Whereas, the Native Hawaiian people are determined to preserve, develop and transmit to future generations their ancestral territory, and their cultural identity in accordance with their own spiritual and traditional beliefs, customs, practices, language, and social institutions;Now, therefore, be itResolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,The Congress- apologizes to Native Hawaiians on behalf of the people of the United States for the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii on January 17, 1893... and the deprivation of the rights of Native Hawaiians to self-determination;- expresses its commitment to acknowledge the ramifications of the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, in order to provide a proper foundation for reconciliation between the United States and the Native Hawaiian people; and- urges the President of the United States to also acknowledge the ramifications of the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii and to support reconciliation efforts between the United States and the Native Hawaiian people.""...the logical consequences of this resolution would be independence.""- Senator Slade Gorton (R-Washington), US Senate Congressional RecordWednesday, October 27, 1993, 103rd Cong. 1st Sess.",3,"2 for the movie, 5 for the special

She is a beloved part of Hawaiian history...it's just that I wish the producers and director of this film had focused on that instead of on a seemingly endless series of prologned Victorian-era make-out scenes between the princess and a young British man.There was only passing mention of the conspiring American land owners who brought about the downfall of the last King and Queen of Hawaii, decisions made to send US troops to the islands to ""protect American lives and interests"", and backroom dealings made to try to subjugate the Hawaiian people to a 2nd or 3rd class citizen status.  Those deplorable dealings should have been the focus of the film.  I would also like to have seen more of the native Hawaiian's efforts to retain their land and country, even in the face of overwhelming military superiority by US forces.I have to admit that the one thing that this movie did inspire in me was a desire to learn more about the history of Hawaii, mainly because so little was actually outlined and focused on in this film.All in all the movie was OK, but I have no need to see it again.Just a so-so effort...3-stars.",3,"It's ""OK"" but it could have been much, much more!",1307318400,"06 6, 2011",2011,1622,"['movie', 'Princess', 'Kaiulani', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'portraying', 'critical', 'moment', 'history', 'when', 'Hawaiian', 'kingdom', 'died/was', 'stolen', 'alas', 'turned', 'out', 'instead', 'be', 'rather', 'lightweight', 'somewhat', 'lame', 'glimpse', 'life', 'times', 'Hawaii', 'last', 'princess.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Princess', 'Kaiulani', 'played', 'extremely', 'important', 'role', 'helping', 'secure', 'full', 'rights', 'people', 'when', 'island', 'kingdom', 'Hawaii', 'was', 'overwhelmed', 'American', 'interests', 'military', 'intervention', 'beloved', 'part', 'Hawaiian', 'history', 'just', 'wish', 'producers', 'director', 'film', 'had', 'focused', 'instead', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'series', 'prologned', 'Victorian-era', 'make-out', 'scenes', 'princess', 'young', 'British', 'man.There', 'was', 'only', 'passing', 'mention', 'conspiring', 'American', 'land', 'owners', 'who', 'brought', 'downfall', 'last', 'King', 'Queen', 'Hawaii', 'decisions', 'made', 'send', 'US', 'troops', 'islands', 'protect', 'American', 'lives', 'interests', 'backroom', 'dealings', 'made', 'try', 'subjugate', 'Hawaiian', 'people', '2nd', '3rd', 'class', 'citizen', 'status', 'deplorable', 'dealings', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'focus', 'film', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'native', 'Hawaiian', 'efforts', 'retain', 'land', 'country', 'even', 'face', 'overwhelming', 'military', 'superiority', 'US', 'forces.I', 'have', 'admit', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'did', 'inspire', 'was', 'desire', 'learn', 'more', 'history', 'Hawaii', 'mainly', 'so', 'little', 'was', 'actually', 'outlined', 'focused', 'film.All', 'movie', 'was', 'OK', 'have', 'need', 'see', 'again.Just', 'so-so', 'effort', '3-stars']",N/A

1339275,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B003EYVXRS,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 3]","13 is my number and I am 13th to review this film. It's only happened twice in nearly 300 reviews!PRINCESS KA'IULANI purports to tell the story of the 19th century Hawai'ian princess, heir to the throne of her uncle King Kalakaua (after her Auntie Lydia, Queen Lili'uokalani assumes a sort of regency, the last monarchy of Hawai'i).The stunning, breathtaking beauty of part-Incan, part-Swiss, German-born Q'orianka Kilcher (THE NEW WORLD as Pocahontas) barely makes up for her serious lack of acting talent. It was in fact the saddest part of this mediocre effort: at least they could have taught her to stun audiences with more than her looks. My impression of her is that she is a former model, but she actually always pursued acting (and singing), is an insanely well-principled political activist, and has a cultural background that makes mine look boring. Beautiful, fascinating, a certifiable genius--but certainly no actress of any caliber.The storyline is also hazy, due to the intense fixation on the princess' life--one minute she's at home, the next minute at some unidentified rich man's estate (the Davies Clan) in England. There the princess stays to be schooled, according to her stern father's wishes (he is a Scot, identified only as ""Archie"", played by Jimmy Yuill). We are treated to endlessly slobbering scenes of her with young Clive Davies (Shaun Evans), with whom she falls in love.The machinations in Hawai'i, meanwhile, are all the explanation I will ever need to feel eternally ashamed of the U.S. and its behavior there. It was a fascinating scene to watch when the princess manages to get to lunch with President Grover Cleveland (Peter Banks). Cleveland, in my opinion, is this nation's greatest president, and naturally he's the most underrated one. He cannot help the princess in her quest to remove the whites from Hawai'i--a point she brilliantly illustrates to President Cleveland by over-spicing a roast chicken. She personally places a morsel of the chicken in the president's mouth, and he exclaims, ""That's terrible!""The president wants to know how the princess thinks it would be best to remove the whites from Hawai'i, naturally all couched in terms of the spices on the chicken. Historically, we know the president was deeply troubled by all this, concerned for the Hawai'ians, but he was to a degree quite lame by then. He had only a few months left in his 2nd presidency. (Yet in 1893, upon assuming office for the 2nd time, President Cleveland withdrew the proposed treaty of the annexation of Hawai'i.)Well, that is about all you'll get from this mess of a film. I found it boring and difficult to follow as a ""historical epic""--which it is falsely billed as being--despite the incredible beauty of Q'orianka Kilcher, who reminds me of Keisha-Castle Hughes.There is an admirable performance turned in by the great Will Patton as Sanford Ballard Dole, Let me give you his brief biography: ""He adopted a native girl (perhaps his biological child), whose descendants are Hawaiian community leaders today. His ties to Koloa remained strong, and he was elected to the Kingdom legislature 1884-86 from Koloa."" Dole was American but native-born and raised as a Hawai'ian. This is not even touched on in the film, to its detriment. In 1887 he led the revolution that forced King Kalakaua to accept a new Constitution, which made the king a mere figurehead, not even a constitutional monarch.Dole and Lili'uokalani were friends. He protected her safety and civil rights during the 1893 revolution.

1339276,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003EYVXRS,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","PRINCESS KA'IULANI feels like a made for TV movie, a film that will inform the viewer about a bit of history few know, but also a rather static and amateurish production - pretty to look at, embarrassing to hear.  Marc Dorby directed this his first directorial outing based on his story written with the assistance of Robert Payne.  The facts presented are apparently true and since few know the background history of Hawaii it is at least informative.Without much historical background about the Islands before the Americans inserted themselves to feast on the beauty and agricultural goods of that paradise, the film begins with a conflict between the anti-Royalists lead by Thurston (Barry Pepper in muttonchops) and the Royal reign of King Kalalaua (Ocean Kaowili), Queen Liliu'okalan (Leo Anderson Akana).  Princess Ka'iulani (Q'orianka Kilcher, a half Peruvian actress remembered for her role as Pocahontas in THE NEW WORLD with Colin Farrell and Christian Bale) is the niece who is in line for the throne, a royal personage who understands kindness in regards to the people of her nation (she is only half Hawaiian - her father is a Scotsman). To protect the princess she is sent to England where she gradually grows accustomed to British snobbery and overcomes it through her inner strength, living in the home of the Davies - Mr. Davies (Julian Glover,  Alice Davies (Tazmin Merchant, from THE TUDORS) and Clive Davies (Shaun Evans).  The family presents her to society, nurtures her, and the princess falls in love with Clive, who is juts ready to enter university, and they become engaged.  Back home in Honolulu things disintegrate: Thurston gathers rebels to take over the Royal rule, alters the constitution to forbid voting by the natives, the King dies, and the Queen is under house arrest.  Princess Ka'iulani travels to the United States to plead her case with President Cleveland, receives a grand reception and then returns home to Hawaii, raises her dignity to cope with Thurston and the anti-Royalists and with the assistance of Sanford B. Dole (Will Patton) she is able to alter the new constitution to allow voting rights to her people.If that all sounds a bit short on story then the viewer can understand why so much time is spent with the princess, Julie and Clive skipping along the beach and finding other moments of diversion to fill the 90 minutes of the film.  The cast is competent and delivers the piecemeal scraps of script given them well.  In the end there jut isn't much story here that isn't fairly obvious from the first 15 minutes of the film.  It is a good lesson about the US annexation of Hawaii and the tension between the native Hawaiians and the 'invaders'......Grady Harp, October 10",3,A bit of little known history,1286064000,"10 3, 2010",2010,2731,"['PRINCESS', ""KA'IULANI"", 'feels', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'film', 'will', 'inform', 'viewer', 'bit', 'history', 'few', 'know', 'also', 'rather', 'static', 'amateurish', 'production', 'pretty', 'look', 'embarrassing', 'hear', 'Marc', 'Dorby', 'directed', 'first', 'directorial', 'outing', 'based', 'story', 'written', 'assistance', 'Robert', 'Payne', 'facts', 'presented', 'are', 'apparently', 'true', 'few', 'know', 'background', 'history', 'Hawaii', 'least', 'informative.Without', 'much', 'historical', 'background', 'Islands', 'Americans', 'inserted', 'feast', 'beauty', 'agricultural', 'goods', 'paradise', 'film', 'conflict', 'anti-Royalists', 'lead', 'Thurston', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'muttonchops', 'Royal', 'reign', 'King', 'Kalalaua', 'Ocean', 'Kaowili', 'Queen', ""Liliu'okalan"", 'Leo', 'Anderson', 'Akana', 'Princess', ""Ka'iulani"", ""Q'orianka"", 'Kilcher', 'half', 'Peruvian', 'actress', 'remembered', 'role', 'Pocahontas', 'THE', 'NEW', 'WORLD', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'niece', 'who', 'line', 'throne', 'royal', 'personage', 'who', 'kindness', 'regards', 'people', 'nation', 'only', 'half', 'Hawaiian', 'father', 'Scotsman', 'protect', 'princess', 'sent', 'England', 'where', 'gradually', 'accustomed', 'British', 'snobbery', 'inner', 'strength', 'living', 'home', 'Davies', 'Mr.', 'Davies', 'Julian', 'Glover', 'Alice', 'Davies', 'Tazmin', 'Merchant', 'THE', 'TUDORS', 'Clive', 'Davies', 'Shaun', 'Evans', 'family', 'society', 'princess', 'love', 'Clive', 'who', 'juts', 'ready', 'enter', 'university', 'become', 'engaged', 'Back', 'home', 'Honolulu', 'things', 'disintegrate', 'Thurston', 'gathers', 'rebels', 'take', 'over', 'Royal', 'rule', 'constitution', 'forbid', 'voting', 'natives', 'King', 'dies', 'Queen', 'house', 'arrest', 'Princess', ""Ka'iulani"", 'United', 'States', 'plead', 'case', 'President', 'Cleveland', 'grand', 'reception', 'then', 'home', 'Hawaii', 'dignity', 'cope', 'Thurston', 'anti-Royalists', 'assistance', 'Sanford', 'B.', 'Dole', 'Will', 'Patton', 'able', 'alter', 'new', 'constitution', 'allow', 'voting', 'rights', 'people.If', 'bit', 'short', 'story', 'then', 'viewer', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'princess', 'Julie', 'Clive', 'skipping', 'beach', 'finding', 'other', 'moments', 'diversion', 'fill', '90', 'minutes', 'film', 'cast', 'competent', 'piecemeal', 'scraps', 'script', 'given', 'well', 'end', 'jut', ""n't"", 'much', 'story', 'here', ""n't"", 'fairly', 'obvious', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'film', 'good', 'lesson', 'US', 'annexation', 'Hawaii', 'tension', 'native', 'Hawaiians', ""'invaders"", 'Grady', 'Harp', 'October', '10']",N/A

The next person in line for the throne was Princess Kaiulani, the daughter of an Hawaiian princess and a Scotsman.  As he feared for his teenaged daughter's life, he brought her to a friend in England for safekeeping.  Here, she attended a strict girls school where she was subjected to the whims of a cruel headmistress but her friendship with the Englishman's daughter helped her cope.

1339294,A2PXUPVH1NJ06Q,B003EYVXRS,"Steven L. Kent ""gamereader""","[1, 8]","If they renamed this movie, ""The Extraordinary Life of the Girl Who Pretended To Be Princess Kaiulani,"" I would almost absolutely give it another star.Re-tooling the movie so that it followed the life and times of a fictitious doppelganger would go a long way toward explaining why the story included so many events that did not occur during the life of the real Victoria Ka'iulani Kalaninuiahilapalapa Kawekiu i Lunalilo Cleghorn--i.e. Princess Ka'iulani.Making the movie about a mysterious Ka'iulani lookalike would almost excuse the public displays of affection between the eponymous heroine and a Scottish shipping heir named Clive Davies.  Princess Ka'iulani may or may not have been engaged to Davies in real life, but they most certainly did not go bouncing around the halls of his estate in a never-ending pre-marital embrace.  Public displays of face-sucking were far from acceptable in Victorian times, especially between young royals and Scottish aristocrats.Of course, to make the movie even more passably historical, the producers might also want to explain that the guy occupying 'Iolani Palace was only passing himself off as King David  Kala'kaua.  That way they could get away with their mock-king pulling a revolver on the villainous Lorrin Thurston.  The real King David Kala'kaua did not hold his enemies at gunpoint.  Carrying pistols did not fit his image of how kings carried themselves.But, hey, this is the movies.  Am I right?  I mean, historical or not, having the king pull a gun on the men who wanted to overthrow his monarchy is  entertaining.  You know, since we're ignoring history, why not go all Schwarzenegger and have the king pull a Gatling gun from his waistband, chase the Missionary Boys up the Pali, and huck their kingdom-stealing okoles over the cliff in an homage to Kamehameha the Great?  That would make for a very satisfying scene.The acting in this movie was not superb, but it still had some of the best acting you'll see in a Hawaiian-made movie.  Q'Orianka Kilcher (who is of Peruvian decent, not Hawaiian) did a credible job playing the young princess's lookalike.  She and the film were at their best during scenes portraying Princess Ka'iulani's tour of the United States.  It was during these moments that the movie came within orbital reach of historical accuracy, and it was during those same moments that the movie was most entertaining.  What a shock, the history was more entertaining than the Hollywood fluff!  Who could have known?Leo Anderson Akana and Ocean Kaowili were more than suitable in the roles of Queen Liliu'okalani and King Kala'kaua; but Barry Pepper stole the show with his infuriating portrayal of Lorrin A. Thurston.This movie got the basic history right--Hawaii had a beautiful princess, her name was Ka'iulani, she was educated in Scotland, and she did visit the United States in a bid to free her overthrown homeland.  Even if the script fudged on the details, it at least got that much correct.  The movie gets high marks for its cinematography and impressive supporting cast.  Just don't use it to bone up for history class.  Readers be warned, if your Hawaiian history professor ever asks, ""Did Princess Ka'iulani and Clive Davies create a scandal in Scotland with their public displays of affection?"", the answer is definitely, ""No.""",3,I would give this movie another star...,1282176000,"08 19, 2010",2010,3319,"['renamed', 'movie', 'Extraordinary', 'Life', 'Girl', 'Who', 'Pretended', 'Be', 'Princess', 'Kaiulani', 'would', 'almost', 'absolutely', 'give', 'star.Re-tooling', 'movie', 'followed', 'life', 'times', 'fictitious', 'doppelganger', 'would', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'explaining', 'why', 'story', 'included', 'so', 'many', 'events', 'did', 'not', 'occur', 'life', 'real', 'Victoria', ""Ka'iulani"", 'Kalaninuiahilapalapa', 'Kawekiu', 'i', 'Lunalilo', 'Cleghorn', 'i.e', 'Princess', ""Ka'iulani.Making"", 'movie', 'mysterious', ""Ka'iulani"", 'lookalike', 'would', 'almost', 'excuse', 'public', 'displays', 'affection', 'eponymous', 'heroine', 'Scottish', 'shipping', 'heir', 'named', 'Clive', 'Davies', 'Princess', ""Ka'iulani"", 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'engaged', 'Davies', 'real', 'life', 'most', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'bouncing', 'halls', 'estate', 'never-ending', 'pre-marital', 'embrace', 'Public', 'displays', 'face-sucking', 'were', 'far', 'acceptable', 'Victorian', 'times', 'especially', 'young', 'royals', 'Scottish', 'aristocrats.Of', 'course', 'make', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'passably', 'historical', 'producers', 'might', 'also', 'want', 'explain', 'guy', 'occupying', ""'Iolani"", 'Palace', 'was', 'only', 'passing', 'off', 'King', 'David', ""Kala'kaua"", 'way', 'could', 'get', 'away', 'mock-king', 'pulling', 'revolver', 'villainous', 'Lorrin', 'Thurston', 'real', 'King', 'David', ""Kala'kaua"", 'did', 'not', 'hold', 'enemies', 'gunpoint', 'Carrying', 'pistols', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'image', 'how', 'kings', 'carried', 'themselves.But', 'hey', 'movies', 'Am', 'right', 'mean', 'historical', 'not', 'having', 'king', 'pull', 'gun', 'men', 'who', 'wanted', 'overthrow', 'monarchy', 'entertaining', 'know', ""'re"", 'ignoring', 'history', 'why', 'not', 'go', 'Schwarzenegger', 'have', 'king', 'pull', 'Gatling', 'gun', 'waistband', 'chase', 'Missionary', 'Boys', 'Pali', 'huck', 'kingdom-stealing', 'okoles', 'cliff', 'homage', 'Kamehameha', 'Great', 'would', 'make', 'very', 'satisfying', 'scene.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'superb', 'still', 'had', 'best', 'acting', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Hawaiian-made', 'movie', ""Q'Orianka"", 'Kilcher', 'who', 'Peruvian', 'decent', 'not', 'Hawaiian', 'did', 'credible', 'job', 'playing', 'young', 'princess', 'lookalike', 'film', 'were', 'best', 'scenes', 'portraying', 'Princess', ""Ka'iulani"", 'tour', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'moments', 'movie', 'came', 'orbital', 'reach', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'was', 'same', 'moments', 'movie', 'was', 'most', 'entertaining', 'What', 'shock', 'history', 'was', 'more', 'entertaining', 'Hollywood', 'fluff', 'Who', 'could', 'have', 'known', 'Leo', 'Anderson', 'Akana', 'Ocean', 'Kaowili', 'were', 'more', 'suitable', 'roles', 'Queen', ""Liliu'okalani"", 'King', ""Kala'kaua"", 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'stole', 'show', 'infuriating', 'portrayal', 'Lorrin', 'A.', 'Thurston.This', 'movie', 'got', 'basic', 'history', 'right', 'Hawaii', 'had', 'beautiful', 'princess', 'name', 'was', ""Ka'iulani"", 'was', 'educated', 'Scotland', 'did', 'visit', 'United', 'States', 'bid', 'free', 'overthrown', 'homeland', 'Even', 'script', 'fudged', 'details', 'least', 'got', 'much', 'correct', 'movie', 'high', 'marks', 'cinematography', 'impressive', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'bone', 'up', 'history', 'class', 'Readers', 'be', 'warned', 'Hawaiian', 'history', 'professor', 'ever', 'Did', 'Princess', ""Ka'iulani"", 'Clive', 'Davies', 'create', 'scandal', 'Scotland', 'public', 'displays', 'affection', 'answer', 'definitely', 'No']",N/A

The evil white people aspect is glossed over about as much as one can and still be historically accurate. The movie is powerful in that you can feel the bravery, anger and heartbreak of Princess Ka'iulani. It was the descendants of the original missionaries which overthrew the government. Worse times followed as Hawaiian culture and language was essentially outlawed, primarily by the Dole family who wanted to westernize everything.This is an excellent movie for the ""young princess"" out there, as it demonstrates being a princess in an exotic land really isn't as good as it pretends to be in a Disney film. The movie is historical to the point that it lacks a happy ending, unless you are an executive for Dole fruit.No nudity, sex, or bad language. This is much information missing from this story, such as Japan's relationship with the island and the King wanting to align Hawaii (the ""w"" pronounced like a ""V"" in the movie) with Japan over the west.

While studying in England, she learns that the kingdom of Hawai'i is overthrown, and travels back to her homeland as heir to the throne.The life story of Princess Ka'iulani is a fascinating one. She is an important historical figure who lived in a time of social and political upheaval in Hawai'i. And ""Princess Ka'iulani"" certainly benefits from authentic locations and a courageous protagonist played by Q'orianka Kilcher. Well-intentioned as it is, however, this bio-pic is perfunctory, lacking energy and enthusiasm.I know it is difficult to tell a story of a person's life within 97 minutes, but I think the film needs a more compelling sense of historical context than is shown here. Will Patton plays Sanford B. Dole. Barry Pepper plays Lorrin A. Thurston. Both are real-life people, but the film does not allow us to know much about the roles they played in the U.S. annexation of Hawai'i. Instead, director Marc Forby (his debut as feature director) spends considerable time on the romance between Princess Ka'iulani and Clive (Shaun Evans), son of her family's associates, a boring subplot that adds nothing to the film.Sometimes it seems ""Princess Ka'iulani"" has glossed over many complicated aspects of her life in favor of a romance. Thus we have a very likable heroine, whose achievements somehow look less impressive and dramatic than they really are. ""Princess Ka'iulani"" is like a badly-written student study guide.
