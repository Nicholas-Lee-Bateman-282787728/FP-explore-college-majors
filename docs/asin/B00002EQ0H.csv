514812,A1SRI13D6GR0X8,B00002EQ0H,a Midwest reviewer,"[0, 1]","A delightful romp of a romantic comedy. What makes it stand out from most other Hollywood romances about love at first sight is that it is a very funny caricature of introverts and extroverts. The movie makes absolutely no pretense about being realistic (someone falls in love in...exactly...thirty seconds - did the director time this scene?). You watch this movie for the facial expressions, the body language, the fleeting touches, for laughing at who is really paying attention, and who is not.  Who puts the moves on and who does not. Who calls a woman the most times and who does  not.If you read a book like ""Are you my type, Am I Yours? Relationships Made Easy Through the Enneagram"" which tells you how to recognize successful and unsuccessful achievers (type 3) and romantics (type 4), and then watch this movie over again, then you will pick up on all kinds of things you don't notice the first time. There's hardly any character development (not supposed to be - they're caricatures) but in a way it is a really groundbreaking movie because it came out in 1999. Today you find all these webpages out there like ""The Mind of an Introvert: Why We Act the Way We Do"" ""How Introverts Communicate"" and ""Introverts in an Extroverts World."" You've got books like ""The Introvert Advantage"" and ""The Introvert & Extrovert in Love"", most of which have all come out just within the last 3-6 years. You've got the author of  ""Good to Great"" telling us that 40% of top CEOs have introverted tendencies and wikipedia telling us how extroverts and introverts minds are really different. What is really amazing is that this movie was ahead of the curve, it came out before all these ideas became so widespread.And perhaps it's because of all the introverts out there that this movie is rated so highly.",5,a fun caricature of extroverts and introverts in love,1230940800,"01 3, 2009",2009,1798,"['delightful', 'romp', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'What', 'stand', 'out', 'most', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'romances', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'very', 'funny', 'caricature', 'introverts', 'extroverts', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'pretense', 'being', 'realistic', 'someone', 'love', 'exactly', 'thirty', 'did', 'director', 'time', 'scene', 'watch', 'movie', 'facial', 'expressions', 'body', 'language', 'fleeting', 'touches', 'laughing', 'who', 'really', 'paying', 'attention', 'who', 'not', 'Who', 'moves', 'who', 'not', 'Who', 'woman', 'most', 'times', 'who', 'not.If', 'read', 'book', 'Are', 'type', 'Am', 'Yours', 'Relationships', 'Made', 'Easy', 'Enneagram', 'how', 'recognize', 'successful', 'unsuccessful', 'achievers', 'type', '3', 'romantics', 'type', '4', 'then', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'then', 'will', 'pick', 'up', 'kinds', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', 'first', 'time', 'hardly', 'character', 'development', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', ""'re"", 'caricatures', 'way', 'really', 'groundbreaking', 'movie', 'came', 'out', '1999', 'Today', 'find', 'webpages', 'out', 'there', 'Mind', 'Introvert', 'Why', 'Act', 'Way', 'Do', 'How', 'Communicate', 'Introverts', 'Extroverts', 'World', ""'ve"", 'got', 'books', 'Introvert', 'Advantage', 'Introvert', 'Extrovert', 'Love', 'most', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'just', 'last', '3-6', 'years', ""'ve"", 'got', 'author', 'Good', 'Great', 'telling', '40', '%', 'top', 'CEOs', 'have', 'introverted', 'tendencies', 'wikipedia', 'telling', 'how', 'extroverts', 'introverts', 'minds', 'are', 'really', 'different', 'What', 'really', 'amazing', 'movie', 'was', 'ahead', 'curve', 'came', 'out', 'ideas', 'became', 'so', 'widespread.And', 'perhaps', 'introverts', 'there', 'movie', 'rated', 'so', 'highly']",The Very Thought of You VHS

No, neither is Monica Potter, although she has an easy charm and a truly gorgeous smile.  The best thing about the film are the three hilarious supporting performances.  Tom Hollander is great as an unlikely rock star and ego-maniac, Ray Winstone charming as the &quot;psychiatrist&quot; and Rufus Sewell constantly giggle-inducing as the unemployed and unemployable actor (the best scene has got to be him on the bus shouting &quot;I love my mother&quot; and hyper-ventilating about an upcoming audition).  Anyhow, despite great work from these three, the movie suffers from being so outrageously implausible.  Oh well, it's a romantic comedy, and it is a lot of fun.

In this one, Monica Potter turns her special, Valentine's Day adorable bunny rabbit charm on three feckless Englishmen (a well-worn character in the romantic comedy genre on both sides of the Atlantic but increasingly annoying in its English incarnation), the best known of whom is Joseph Fiennes (who looks rather weaker and sillier than I recall him looking in most of his films). The plot is heavy on circumstance and happenstance and weak on character and emotional involvement. I never really felt that there was the slightest chemistry between the two leads. Ms. Potter, a sweet if somewhat cloying actress with almost aggressive American good-looks, works hard to convince us of her convictions which amount to needing to change her entire life from the ground up. Looking at her we can hardly believe that any of the things which she tells us about her terrible past are true. She is just too clean and too terrifically healthy and downright pretty to have had a trying youth and a less than boisterously successful present. As for Mr. Fiennes, we don't get Will Shakespeare, we get Hugh Grant Lite (thanks, Mr. Grant, for raising stammering diffidence from mere character affect to complete character status) a tongue-tied fool who just cannot speak when he needs to. The wonderful Ray Winstone - pre-Sexy Beast - is used here merely as a foil through which this backward-told tale is related. The unfolding of the plot is clever enough and the players congenial enough to make this film easy to sit through.

I watched it on my laptop during an open house on a rainy day (very few visitors), and it was the perfect sort of movie for that particular situation.  The plot is not complex at all (good for frequent stoppages), though the acting appropriately highlights the best parts of the script.  It's an off-beat sort of romantic comedy from a screenwriter who should come out with better things in the future.  Monica Potter and Joseph Fiennes give believable performances as hopeless romantics looking for a better life.  Friends, foreign travel, and two minor injuries to Fiennes' character mixes up their plans.",3,Pleasant Fluff,1068768000,"11 14, 2003",2003,774,"[""'Very"", 'Thought', 'was', 'one', 'guilty', 'little', 'pleasures', 'take', 'vegetating', 'cold', 'day', 'successfully', 'procrastinating', 'away', 'project', 'watched', 'laptop', 'open', 'house', 'rainy', 'day', 'very', 'few', 'visitors', 'was', 'perfect', 'sort', 'movie', 'particular', 'situation', 'plot', 'not', 'complex', 'good', 'frequent', 'stoppages', 'acting', 'appropriately', 'best', 'parts', 'script', 'off-beat', 'sort', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'screenwriter', 'who', 'should', 'come', 'out', 'better', 'things', 'future', 'Monica', 'Potter', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'give', 'believable', 'performances', 'hopeless', 'romantics', 'looking', 'better', 'life', 'Friends', 'foreign', 'travel', 'two', 'minor', 'injuries', 'Fiennes', 'character', 'mixes', 'up', 'plans']",The Very Thought of You VHS

Sure, it didn't have the big-name stars of Nora Ephron's later formula  romantic comedies Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail (yes, Nora  Ephron knows what sells even if it is manipulative),but the film's utter  charm lies in its simplicity, especially Monica Potter's understated and  delicious performance as Martha.  Demonstrating that less is definitely  more, she has no need to draw from the bag of romantic comedy tricks  including the manufactured, artifical ear-to-ear grins and calculatingly  cute turn of the heads that other actresses of the genre have cheaply  relied on.  The result is a performance of depth, and the entire cast and  production crew obviously worked very hard to have produced this  mouth-watering confection of a film.
