515294,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B00002RARS,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[5, 5]","The premise of this superior British police thriller is that the brilliant young investigator Ross Tanner, compelling played by Clive Owen, is going blind. As his sight deteriorates due to a rare virus, he literally sees stars -- and sometimes he sees things which aren't there. The acting is enhanced by wonderful camera work and an unusually perceptive script.Tanner, aided by a young, up and coming female investigator played by Claire Skinner, is trying to solve the mysterious murder of a 19-year-old student. He tries to hide his worsening blindness but she catches on and makes a deal: she'll be his eyes if she can share credit for solving the murder and put her career back on track.There are plenty of backstories, well-developed, and a good supporting cast, but the chemistry between the two leads is what makes this mini-series compelling.The plot itself uses Tanner's blindness and his ""visions"" of things that are not there as a metaphor. Of course, nothing is what it seems. The dead boy's step-father, his long-lost uncle, his mother, his girlfriend, all have their particular view of the murder and the victim -- but each one is looking from a particular angle through their own blinkers -- or in one case their own, elaborately-constructed fiction.It all makes for a satisfying, complex brew with many different flavors going into the mix. And it works on many levels, as a human drama, a straight police investigation and a metaphorical probe into what is, and what merely appears to be.",5,unusually intelligent police thriller,1290643200,"11 25, 2010",2010,1506,"['premise', 'superior', 'British', 'police', 'thriller', 'brilliant', 'young', 'investigator', 'Ross', 'Tanner', 'compelling', 'played', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'going', 'blind', 'sight', 'deteriorates', 'due', 'rare', 'virus', 'literally', 'stars', 'sometimes', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'acting', 'enhanced', 'wonderful', 'camera', 'work', 'unusually', 'perceptive', 'script.Tanner', 'aided', 'young', 'up', 'coming', 'female', 'investigator', 'played', 'Claire', 'Skinner', 'trying', 'solve', 'mysterious', 'murder', '19-year-old', 'student', 'hide', 'worsening', 'blindness', 'deal', ""'ll"", 'be', 'eyes', 'can', 'share', 'credit', 'solving', 'murder', 'put', 'career', 'back', 'are', 'plenty', 'backstories', 'well-developed', 'good', 'supporting', 'cast', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'what', 'mini-series', 'compelling.The', 'plot', 'Tanner', 'blindness', 'visions', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'there', 'metaphor', 'course', 'nothing', 'what', 'dead', 'boy', 'step-father', 'long-lost', 'uncle', 'mother', 'girlfriend', 'have', 'particular', 'view', 'murder', 'victim', 'one', 'looking', 'particular', 'angle', 'own', 'blinkers', 'one', 'case', 'own', 'elaborately-constructed', 'fiction.It', 'satisfying', 'complex', 'brew', 'many', 'different', 'flavors', 'going', 'mix', 'many', 'levels', 'human', 'drama', 'straight', 'police', 'investigation', 'metaphorical', 'probe', 'what', 'what', 'merely', 'be']",N/A

With his sight endangered, the head of an elite ""Murder Squad"" has to find a way to play his professional role while he awaits the verdict on the outcome of his illness. Both in the role of police officer and divorced father, as commander and lover, he must find a way to fulfill his obligations while trying to cope with an increasingly crippling personal disaster. One  of the strengths of the production is its ability to show the officers emotional stress without sinking into bathos and overwrought emotionalism. Another strength is that the cases themselves are interesting quite apart from the problems of the chief  officer. The plots are strong, the scenic design supportive, the acting consistent with the tradition of quality.

For most American's this was their introduction to Clive Owen.Clive Owen stars as DCI Ross Tanner, the head of the Elite Murder Unit. Like the other great British police detectives of the time, Ross Tanner had an issue that he had to contend with.  But unlike the others, this cannot be cured.  He has a rare eye disease and is slowly loosing his sight.  The only person who knows his secret is DI Catherine Tully.  Like most British shows, this focuses on quality over quantity.  Therefore, there are only five two hour episodes.The following are the episodes:Second Sight Pilot: Tanner discovers he is losing his sight but has been made the head of an elite murder unit.  The first case has a number of suspects including Tanner's stepfather.Hide and Seek: Vicki Inghram has been brutally murdered.  Tanner wants to recreate the scene but the use of Vicki's son causes more issues than tanner expected.Parasomnia: A man is bludgeoned to death after his stag party.  His fiance wakes up covered in blood but has no recollection of the murder.  Tanner starts having hallucinations due to his losing his sight.Kingdom of the Blind: Tanner is investigating a hate crime.  Everything points to retired gangster, Harold King.  The only this is King is blind.  But while Tanner uses his blindness to seek the truth, King has let his fester his hate.While Owen's Ross Tanner does not compare to Helen Mirren's Jane Tennison or Clive Owen's Dave Creegan, these five episodes show are still better than most American detective shows of the time.  Kingdom of the Blind is by far the best of the lot.  It is too bad that it stopped there.For Clive Owen fans, this is an insight to his early career.

Clive Owen, who made Jack Manfred a classic antihero in CROUPIER, fleshes out a fascinating character in DCI Ross Tanner as the SECOND SIGHT series begins with this two-tape set.  Tanner is a divorced (aren't they always?) workaholic with an ambitious ex-wife and an adoring young son who seems to double as Tanner's only real friend.  In this go-round, Tanner is beginning to lose his eyesight to a rare disease for which there stands no present cure.  Hiding his condition and his terror is not going to be easy, however.  The fadeouts are unpredictable and often frightening and his new partner, Catherine Tully, is on to him.  Equally ambitious, and out to correct an old wrong, Tully offers to be Tanner's eyes if he will give her a crack at their new case--the death of a young university student in his own backyard while no one in the family seemed to notice.Claire Skinner is, as always, expert and enjoyable to watch but its Clive Owen's show all the way.  His unconventional good looks and rugged exterior share space with a tender, devoted father and a fair-minded, ingenious detective but Owen also gives Ross Tanner something else, that rarest of things in movie characters--the suggestion of an inner life which is every bit as fascinating as his day-to-day crime solving.  Great production values and fine supporting performances (especially from Stuart Wilson and Phoebe Nicholls) make SECOND SIGHT a must for any British mystery video library.",5,SPELLBINDING HERO MAKES SERIES CRACKLE.,1002672000,"10 10, 2001",2001,1585,"['Fans', 'art', 'house', 'cult', 'hit', 'CROUPIER', 'will', 'delight', 'first', 'entry', 'yet', 'first-rate', 'British', 'mystery', 'series', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'who', 'made', 'Jack', 'Manfred', 'classic', 'antihero', 'CROUPIER', 'out', 'fascinating', 'character', 'DCI', 'Ross', 'Tanner', 'SECOND', 'SIGHT', 'series', 'two-tape', 'set', 'Tanner', 'divorced', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'workaholic', 'ambitious', 'ex-wife', 'adoring', 'young', 'son', 'who', 'double', 'Tanner', 'only', 'real', 'friend', 'go-round', 'Tanner', 'beginning', 'lose', 'eyesight', 'rare', 'disease', 'present', 'cure', 'Hiding', 'condition', 'terror', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'easy', 'however', 'fadeouts', 'are', 'unpredictable', 'often', 'frightening', 'new', 'partner', 'Catherine', 'Tully', 'Equally', 'ambitious', 'correct', 'old', 'wrong', 'Tully', 'be', 'Tanner', 'eyes', 'will', 'give', 'crack', 'new', 'case', 'death', 'young', 'university', 'student', 'own', 'backyard', 'one', 'family', 'seemed', 'notice.Claire', 'Skinner', 'always', 'expert', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'show', 'way', 'unconventional', 'good', 'looks', 'rugged', 'exterior', 'share', 'space', 'tender', 'devoted', 'father', 'fair-minded', 'ingenious', 'detective', 'Owen', 'also', 'Ross', 'Tanner', 'something', 'else', 'rarest', 'things', 'movie', 'characters', 'suggestion', 'inner', 'life', 'bit', 'as', 'fascinating', 'day-to-day', 'crime', 'solving', 'Great', 'production', 'values', 'fine', 'supporting', 'performances', 'especially', 'Stuart', 'Wilson', 'Phoebe', 'Nicholls', 'make', 'SECOND', 'SIGHT', 'must', 'British', 'mystery', 'video', 'library']",N/A

515302,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B00002RARS,Stephanie De Pue,"[3, 4]","""Second Sight, Season 1."" (1999-2001) is a British-made television series, a police procedural/ British mystery/thriller. It was made jointly by the British Broadcasting Corporation, and WGBH, Boston flagship station of the American public broadcasting network.  This first series concerns just the one murder; the episodes have been cut so as to give the viewer a continuous narrative. In it, British detective DCI Ross Tanner must change his approach to investigating crimes in the middle of a murder case when he finds he has developed an obscure eye disorder (AZOOR) that causes spells of blindness and hallucinations. He chooses to try to hide the problem from his colleagues, as it is grounds for dismissal from the job.  He therefore strikes a deal with his beautiful blond second in command DCI Catherine Tully.  If she will cover his back, he will share any eventual glory with her.  Tanner, whom we understand lives for his work, desperately tries to continue his investigations; he eventually realizes that solving crimes is as much about what's not visible as what is.A young, charismatic, rough-hewn Clive Owen (Children of Men,Inside Man) plays Tanner. Claire Skinner (A Dance to the Music of Time) who doesn't look much like a copper, and must then have been beautiful blond of the week, plays Tully.  The case involves the brutal murder of a young man, son of Judith Bendrix (Phoebe Nicholls,Brideshead Revisited: 30th Anniversary Edition) and Adam Bendrix, (Stuart Wilson,Fascination) who also plays Adam's identical twin, Jack Kenworthy.Owen, who can project tough vulnerability, does not make Tanner a loveable man.  He's a drunk, a womanizer, neglectful of his family, and a tough boss - but he gets the job done.  The crime drama is interesting in its portrayal of Tanner's impaired vision, with flashes of light, and other graphic effects onscreen.  It is dark, thoughtful and suspenseful: the ambiance of London, and of the cop shop, is well-portrayed.  It's intense, and gripping - would have to be with Owen on hand.  The series was created by Paula Milne, one of Britain's leading screenwriters, who left school just before her fifteenth birthday, without academic qualifications, and pretty much began her TV career as the tea girl.  She broke in as a script writer at CORONATION STREET, did some RUTH RENDELL MYSTERIES, also penned I DREAMED OF AFRICA, and THE VIRGIN QUEEN.I can remember loving and looking forward to this series as it was broadcast in the United States on BBCAmerica:  I'm always a sucker for intensity and ambiance.  Of course, in those days, BBCAmerica broadcast many fine British mysteries; now they broadcast supernatural crap.  More critically, I could hear it back then; make out what people were saying, whereas now, although I could follow the basic plot, the dialog of the blond, and the cockneys in the cop shop, went right by me.  So far as I know, neither the BBC nor WGBH is short of finance, so I don't know why they would have chosen to limit the audience that can enjoy this fine, cerebral film in this penny-wise, pound-foolish way.  A very good film, if you can follow it.",3,"Very Good Film, If You Can Follow It",1328572800,"02 7, 2012",2012,3137,"['Second', 'Sight', 'Season', '1', '1999-2001', 'British-made', 'television', 'series', 'police', 'procedural/', 'British', 'mystery/thriller', 'was', 'made', 'jointly', 'British', 'Broadcasting', 'Corporation', 'WGBH', 'Boston', 'flagship', 'station', 'American', 'public', 'broadcasting', 'network', 'first', 'series', 'concerns', 'just', 'one', 'murder', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'so', 'give', 'viewer', 'continuous', 'narrative', 'British', 'detective', 'DCI', 'Ross', 'Tanner', 'must', 'change', 'approach', 'investigating', 'crimes', 'middle', 'murder', 'case', 'when', 'developed', 'obscure', 'eye', 'disorder', 'AZOOR', 'spells', 'blindness', 'hallucinations', 'try', 'hide', 'problem', 'colleagues', 'grounds', 'dismissal', 'job', 'therefore', 'deal', 'beautiful', 'blond', 'second', 'command', 'DCI', 'Catherine', 'Tully', 'will', 'cover', 'back', 'will', 'share', 'eventual', 'glory', 'Tanner', 'whom', 'understand', 'lives', 'work', 'desperately', 'continue', 'investigations', 'eventually', 'solving', 'crimes', 'as', 'much', 'what', 'not', 'visible', 'what', 'is.A', 'young', 'charismatic', 'rough-hewn', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Children', 'Men', 'Inside', 'Man', 'Tanner', 'Claire', 'Skinner', 'Dance', 'Music', 'Time', 'who', ""n't"", 'look', 'much', 'copper', 'must', 'then', 'have', 'been', 'beautiful', 'blond', 'week', 'Tully', 'case', 'brutal', 'murder', 'young', 'man', 'son', 'Judith', 'Bendrix', 'Phoebe', 'Nicholls', 'Brideshead', 'Revisited', '30th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'Adam', 'Bendrix', 'Stuart', 'Wilson', 'Fascination', 'who', 'also', 'Adam', 'identical', 'twin', 'Jack', 'Kenworthy.Owen', 'who', 'can', 'project', 'tough', 'vulnerability', 'not', 'make', 'Tanner', 'loveable', 'man', 'drunk', 'womanizer', 'neglectful', 'family', 'tough', 'boss', 'job', 'done', 'crime', 'drama', 'interesting', 'portrayal', 'Tanner', 'impaired', 'vision', 'flashes', 'light', 'other', 'graphic', 'effects', 'onscreen', 'dark', 'thoughtful', 'suspenseful', 'ambiance', 'London', 'cop', 'shop', 'well-portrayed', 'intense', 'gripping', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'Owen', 'hand', 'series', 'was', 'created', 'Paula', 'Milne', 'one', 'Britain', 'leading', 'screenwriters', 'who', 'left', 'school', 'just', 'fifteenth', 'birthday', 'academic', 'qualifications', 'pretty', 'much', 'began', 'TV', 'career', 'tea', 'girl', 'broke', 'script', 'writer', 'CORONATION', 'STREET', 'did', 'RUTH', 'RENDELL', 'MYSTERIES', 'also', 'penned', 'DREAMED', 'OF', 'AFRICA', 'THE', 'VIRGIN', 'QUEEN.I', 'can', 'remember', 'loving', 'looking', 'forward', 'series', 'was', 'broadcast', 'United', 'States', 'BBCAmerica', ""'m"", 'always', 'sucker', 'intensity', 'ambiance', 'course', 'days', 'BBCAmerica', 'broadcast', 'many', 'fine', 'British', 'mysteries', 'now', 'broadcast', 'supernatural', 'crap', 'More', 'critically', 'could', 'hear', 'back', 'then', 'make', 'out', 'what', 'people', 'were', 'saying', 'whereas', 'now', 'could', 'follow', 'basic', 'plot', 'dialog', 'blond', 'cockneys', 'cop', 'shop', 'went', 'right', 'So', 'far', 'know', 'BBC', 'WGBH', 'short', 'finance', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'would', 'have', 'chosen', 'limit', 'audience', 'can', 'enjoy', 'fine', 'cerebral', 'film', 'penny-wise', 'pound-foolish', 'way', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'can', 'follow']",N/A
