Goddard ""...can't stop reading..""","[14, 15]","This 4 disc collection of season 1 My Little Pony episodes provides a great trip down memory lane for any child of the 80s but is also a great set for any new millenium child or pre-teen who enjoys ponies, horses, or the G3 (newer released) my little ponies.The box set has art work from the G2 (or second release of the MLP- late 90s) ponies because Hasbro lost the rights to the original MLP (G1- or generation 1- the original MLP characters).  Don't let this fool you, however. The 4 disc multi episode collection features the beloved pegasus winged ponies, unicorns, spike the dragon, the bushwollies, as well as megan and the other Earth ponies.The episodes have a more developed plot than the newer G3 (current movies) as well as ponies and vilians with more complex personalities and personas.  Re-watching the episodes as an adult, it is fasanating to observe the many morales and complex issues that some of the ponies worked through.As a pediatric provider, this is a great highly recommended television viewing boxed set to own and love for the current generation of pony fans or an adult with a little girl's heart and mind trapped inside.",4,My Little Pony I love the 80s revisited,1154995200,"08 8, 2006",2006,1151,"['4', 'disc', 'collection', 'season', '1', 'My', 'Little', 'Pony', 'great', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'child', '80s', 'also', 'great', 'set', 'new', 'millenium', 'child', 'pre-teen', 'who', 'ponies', 'horses', 'G3', 'newer', 'released', 'little', 'ponies.The', 'box', 'set', 'art', 'work', 'G2', 'second', 'release', 'MLP-', 'late', '90s', 'ponies', 'Hasbro', 'lost', 'rights', 'original', 'MLP', 'G1-', 'generation', '1-', 'original', 'MLP', 'characters', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'fool', 'however', '4', 'disc', 'multi', 'episode', 'collection', 'beloved', 'pegasus', 'winged', 'ponies', 'unicorns', 'spike', 'dragon', 'bushwollies', 'as', 'well', 'megan', 'other', 'Earth', 'ponies.The', 'episodes', 'have', 'more', 'developed', 'plot', 'newer', 'G3', 'current', 'movies', 'as', 'well', 'ponies', 'vilians', 'more', 'complex', 'personalities', 'personas', 'Re-watching', 'episodes', 'adult', 'fasanating', 'observe', 'many', 'morales', 'complex', 'issues', 'ponies', 'worked', 'through.As', 'pediatric', 'provider', 'great', 'highly', 'recommended', 'television', 'viewing', 'boxed', 'set', 'own', 'love', 'current', 'generation', 'pony', 'fans', 'adult', 'little', 'girl', 'heart', 'mind', 'trapped', 'inside']",N/A

855152,A1QVYESH99CE6D,B0004Z349U,"T. Taylor ""Crimson Fox""","[4, 8]","I have been a 'My Little Pony' fan since the first series of toys. I am 26 now, so I grew up in the 80's with all the cool toys, cartoons, and games. I *still* collect MLPs today and have been buying many of the newest series of toys and DVDs.So, naturally, I was thrilled with the release of the original MLP cartoons on a DVD set. I did not remember the cartoon series much, except for the 2 specials which I always loved and still have on recorded VHS, so those were fresh in my mind.When buying the DVD set, I assumed that the whole series was similar to the 2 specials episodes. Boy was I wrong!The 2 specials, ""Rescue at Midnight Castle"" (the pilot episode) and ""Escape from Katrina"" had great storylines with alot of Adventure and enemies without being overly violent for kids, yet still dark enough for even boys to be able to enjoy watching. The animation was well done, the characters were well drawn, the voices fit the characters perfectly, and even the songs were good (thats coming from someone who hates singing in cartoons)!The rest of the series had a different, more 'overly-cutesy' art style, some of the voices got on my nerves, and the songs in each episode were horrid. The storylines were very uncreative and enemies were just dumb and annoying (ugh those irritating witches in End of Flutter Valley, and that annoying pig in glass princess.... The enemy characters were awesome in the 2 specials)Now the worst part is... the only 2 good episodes (the specials of course) were edited versions!!! Scenes and cute songs were cut out of these great episodes yet the rest of the series seems to be intact.So I can't even make use of the DVD set to enjoy my 2 favorite, genuinely good, episodes of MLP. Thnakfully I still have the recorded-from-TV VHS tape to watch those in their full glory!And what were they thinking with the box-art? Those aren't even true MLPs on the box. Those are crummy cartoon-drawings of that horrible series of MLP toys released sometime in the late-90's I think it was... wasn't even by Hasbro. Just some cheap looking, scrawny excuses for MLPs. Thankfully Hasbro makes the new series again.I gave as many as 2 stars mainly for the fond memories. I still love MLP, and the DVD set is a worthy addition to serious fans/collectors of MLP who want to at least have that box of memories on their shelf.There was *some* cute parts here and there, but overall it wasn't very good at all. They really should have made the whole series with the same art-style, voices, and interesting storylines as the 2 specials.There are plenty of DVD sets of old cartoons I have been buying (Thundercats, Ducktales, Mario, Zelda, etc.) and I still enjoy them as much as I remember as a kid.I wish I could say the same about My Little Pony. Ah well. MLP is still my favorite 80's toy at least :)They are getting better with the newer cartoons actually... the first few were corny, but the newest movie (Princess Promenade) is actually quite good so far (just bought it today and watching it now. My only problem is that they ruined 'Spike' the dragon...). Minty Christmas was also pretty cute.
