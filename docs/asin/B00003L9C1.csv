It was, literally, banned in Alabama, which was ruled entirely by...the Democrat party. In 1967, Poitier again stirred the red-necks with &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, where he plays Virgil Tibbs, a competent Philadelphia cop stuck overnight in a Mississippi town. It must be 110 degrees at night. The white boys sweat like stuck pigs while Virgil is as cool as a cucumber in a Savoy Row suit. The sheriff, Rod Steiger, is discomfited by circumstances in which Tibbs is &quot;lent&quot; to him to solve a murder that happens to occur when he is there. In working together, layer after layer of characterization is stripped away in marvelous fashion, through the skill of director Norman Jewison (who tells everybody he is not a Jew, he is Methodist), until understanding between the two men become a metaphor for the healing of a divided America.

545302,A2FIEBYAFQIIIP,B00003L9C1,,"[2, 23]",The critics rated this movie as unbeleievable when it came out. And I agree! The teacher Thackeray (played by Sydney Poitier) has way too much success with turning all his trouble students into complete goody-goodies. Poitier's acting is showed up and surpassed by that of Judy Geeson (who plays one of his students). It has been pointed out at nitpickers.com that this film has major editing problems and I noticed one myself when one the most hoodest of students is talking to Poitier in some gym room scene. Back to Poitier he admitted in his own damned autobiography that he in real life is little like the perfect and educated characters he plays here and in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.

545304,A3VAXB8CDYY5BG,B00003L9C1,,"[3, 3]","In light of the critical problems facing the American public school system over the last 40 years, it's a wonder more educators of all backgrounds and stations haven't learned and applied the basic lessons dramatized in 'To Sir, With Love' (1967), one of the simplest but most astute cinematic works to ever address the subject of education. There have been many worthy films about teaching and educational methods before and since, including 'Goodbye, Mr. Chips' (1939), 'The Corn Is Green' (1945), 'The Blackboard Jungle' (1955), 'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie' (1969), 'The Dead Poets Society' (1989), and, most recently, 'Mona Lisa Smile' (2003), but none of these films speaks with the keenness, immediacy, and wisdom of director James Clavell's brilliant, engaging, and emotionally stirring classic.Motherhood may indeed be ""the most important job in the world,"" but motherhood is often unplanned, accidental, and even incidental in the lives of many women around the world.  Teaching, however, is, at its best, a deeply felt and motivated vocation, and an absolutely fundamental condition of any community, society, culture, or civilization that wishes to continue to exist and evolve.'To Sir, With Love' tells the story of Mark Thackeray (Sidney Poitier), a relatively young gentleman of Guyanese origin who takes a job teaching school in the slums of London's East End while waiting for a superior position as an engineer to manifest. Daily confronted by the belligerence, coarseness and, in some cases, overt hostility of his students, Mark sets out on a fairly radical course of action. Instead of utilizing the textbooks provided, he decides to confront his students in as direct a manner as they have confronted him, opening the floor to relatively frank and adult conversation, taking them out into the larger world most of them have never had an opportunity to experience, providing them with a sense of perspective about the tumultuous era in which they live, and by treating them as beings worthy of respect in the wider adult world they will shortly be entering--if they in turn can first learn to respect themselves and one another.By turns steely and determined, vulnerable and caring, Mark, after painful trial and error, eventually succeeds in teaching his students not only what self-respect is, but what dignity, honor, honesty, fortitude, tolerance, and courage are as well.  As the world-famous Don Black / Mark London theme song performed by Lulu declares, Mark teaches them ""right from wrong, and weak from strong, that's a lot to learn."" Deeply moved by their unexpected farewell gift to him at end of term, Mark, who has finally landed an engineering position, has an unexpected personal revelation after encountering boisterous members of the forthcoming class.Steering free of melodrama at almost every turn, 'To Sir, With Love' effortlessly reveals how commitment, discipline, dedication, civility, trust, and, above all, genuine concern, lie at the heart of the educational process, in addition to a willingness to engage students on as deep a level as is possible, however difficult or awkward this may prove.Though not an exercise in ""pure cinema"" like 'Metropolis' (1927), 'Pandora's Box' (1929), 'Citizen Kane"" (1941), 'Beauty and the Beast' (1946), 'Breathless' (1960), or 'Blue Velvet' (1986), 'To Sir, With Love' remains a fittingly educational cinematic gem which can be appreciated and absorbed by audiences of every background, lifestyle, and temperament. The film makes excellent family viewing, and should be figurative 'required viewing' for all parents, future parents, and educators.1967 was a banner year for Poitier, who gives a highly nuanced performance as the inwardly-torn Mark Thackeray.  Lovely Judy Geeson excels as the assertive, aptly-named Pamela Dare, and future pop star Lulu shines as the bright, mischievous Miss Peg. Fans of British comedy should watch for Patricia Routledge of 'Keeping Up Appearances' fame in a smaller role as one of Mark's fellow educators.",4,"Those Who Can Do, Teach",1175558400,"04 3, 2007",2007,4027,"['light', 'critical', 'problems', 'facing', 'American', 'public', 'school', 'system', 'last', '40', 'years', 'wonder', 'more', 'educators', 'backgrounds', 'stations', 'have', ""n't"", 'learned', 'applied', 'basic', 'lessons', 'dramatized', ""'To"", 'Sir', 'Love', '1967', 'one', 'simplest', 'most', 'astute', 'cinematic', 'works', 'ever', 'address', 'subject', 'education', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'worthy', 'films', 'teaching', 'educational', 'methods', 'including', ""'Goodbye"", 'Mr.', 'Chips', '1939', 'Corn', 'Is', 'Green', '1945', 'Blackboard', 'Jungle', '1955', ""'The"", 'Prime', 'Miss', 'Jean', 'Brodie', '1969', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', '1989', 'most', 'recently', 'Lisa', 'Smile', '2003', 'none', 'films', 'speaks', 'keenness', 'immediacy', 'wisdom', 'director', 'James', 'Clavell', 'brilliant', 'engaging', 'emotionally', 'stirring', 'classic.Motherhood', 'may', 'indeed', 'be', 'most', 'important', 'job', 'world', 'motherhood', 'often', 'unplanned', 'accidental', 'even', 'incidental', 'lives', 'many', 'women', 'world', 'Teaching', 'however', 'best', 'deeply', 'felt', 'motivated', 'vocation', 'absolutely', 'fundamental', 'condition', 'community', 'society', 'culture', 'civilization', 'continue', 'exist', 'evolve', ""'To"", 'Sir', 'Love', 'story', 'Mark', 'Thackeray', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'relatively', 'young', 'gentleman', 'Guyanese', 'origin', 'who', 'job', 'teaching', 'school', 'slums', 'London', 'East', 'End', 'waiting', 'superior', 'position', 'engineer', 'manifest', 'Daily', 'confronted', 'belligerence', 'coarseness', 'cases', 'overt', 'hostility', 'students', 'Mark', 'out', 'fairly', 'radical', 'course', 'action', 'Instead', 'utilizing', 'textbooks', 'provided', 'confront', 'students', 'direct', 'manner', 'have', 'confronted', 'opening', 'floor', 'relatively', 'frank', 'adult', 'conversation', 'taking', 'out', 'larger', 'world', 'most', 'have', 'never', 'had', 'opportunity', 'experience', 'providing', 'sense', 'perspective', 'tumultuous', 'era', 'live', 'treating', 'beings', 'respect', 'wider', 'adult', 'world', 'will', 'shortly', 'be', 'entering', 'turn', 'can', 'first', 'learn', 'respect', 'one', 'another.By', 'steely', 'determined', 'vulnerable', 'caring', 'Mark', 'painful', 'trial', 'error', 'eventually', 'teaching', 'students', 'not', 'only', 'what', 'self-respect', 'what', 'dignity', 'honor', 'honesty', 'fortitude', 'tolerance', 'courage', 'are', 'as', 'well', 'world-famous', 'Don', 'Black', '/', 'Mark', 'London', 'theme', 'song', 'performed', 'Lulu', 'declares', 'Mark', 'right', 'wrong', 'weak', 'strong', 'lot', 'learn', 'Deeply', 'moved', 'unexpected', 'farewell', 'gift', 'end', 'term', 'Mark', 'who', 'finally', 'landed', 'engineering', 'position', 'unexpected', 'personal', 'revelation', 'encountering', 'boisterous', 'members', 'forthcoming', 'class.Steering', 'free', 'melodrama', 'almost', 'turn', 'Sir', 'Love', 'effortlessly', 'how', 'commitment', 'discipline', 'dedication', 'civility', 'trust', 'genuine', 'concern', 'lie', 'heart', 'educational', 'process', 'addition', 'willingness', 'engage', 'students', 'deep', 'level', 'possible', 'however', 'difficult', 'awkward', 'may', 'prove.Though', 'not', 'exercise', 'pure', 'cinema', ""'Metropolis"", '1927', 'Box', '1929', 'Kane', '1941', 'Beast', '1946', '1960', 'Velvet', '1986', 'Sir', 'Love', 'fittingly', 'educational', 'cinematic', 'gem', 'can', 'be', 'appreciated', 'absorbed', 'audiences', 'background', 'lifestyle', 'temperament', 'film', 'excellent', 'family', 'viewing', 'should', 'be', 'figurative', ""'required"", 'viewing', 'parents', 'future', 'parents', 'educators.1967', 'was', 'banner', 'year', 'Poitier', 'who', 'highly', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'inwardly-torn', 'Mark', 'Thackeray', 'Lovely', 'Judy', 'Geeson', 'excels', 'assertive', 'aptly-named', 'Pamela', 'Dare', 'future', 'pop', 'star', 'Lulu', 'bright', 'mischievous', 'Miss', 'Peg', 'Fans', 'British', 'comedy', 'should', 'watch', 'Patricia', 'Routledge', ""'Keeping"", 'Up', 'Appearances', 'fame', 'smaller', 'role', 'one', 'Mark', 'fellow', 'educators']",N/A

In fact, had the ending not been so lazily constructed (why does it feel like the film is missing about twenty minutes of character development) this film would have been a marvel of a film.Still, the performances across the board are great, especially from Sidney Poitier, who was having a banner year in 1967 (and this is his finest performance of the three he released).  The students are played with real grit and honesty by the likes of Judy Geeson, Christian Roberts and British Popstar Lulu (who also sings the film's title track).The idea of a black man teaching white students in the 60's was unheard of and caused quite the controversy, but I was really pleased with the fact that this film doesn't make race the issue here, where it really could have rather easily.  It is touched upon, but never in a manner that makes it feel overbearing.  Instead, the focus is left on a teachers ability to mold and influence young minds in a positive direction, with passion and soul.  My issue with the ending has more to do with the lack of true development in the `change' that overcomes these students.  The film hints at the change but never makes it more than a passing sentiment.  You just know that these kids are changing, but we don't `feel it', if that makes sense.Still, this is a well-made film that could have easily veered into redundancy, but it somehow feels fresh despite being nearly 50 years old!",4,One of the best of the `been there done that' variety...,1379980800,"09 24, 2013",2013,1694,"['good', 'teacher', 'save', 'day', 'rough', 'school', 'unruly', 'students', 'been', 'done', 'redone', 'done', 'again', 'occasion', 'been', 'done', 'perfection', 'Sir', 'Love', 'one', 'better', 'attempts', 'formulaic', 'genre', 'came', 'close', 'being', 'perfect', 'fact', 'had', 'ending', 'not', 'been', 'so', 'lazily', 'constructed', 'why', 'feel', 'film', 'missing', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'character', 'development', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'marvel', 'film.Still', 'performances', 'board', 'are', 'great', 'especially', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'who', 'was', 'having', 'banner', 'year', '1967', 'finest', 'performance', 'three', 'released', 'students', 'are', 'played', 'real', 'grit', 'honesty', 'likes', 'Judy', 'Geeson', 'Christian', 'Roberts', 'British', 'Popstar', 'Lulu', 'who', 'also', 'film', 'title', 'track', 'idea', 'black', 'man', 'teaching', 'white', 'students', '60', 'was', 'unheard', 'caused', 'quite', 'controversy', 'was', 'really', 'pleased', 'fact', 'film', ""n't"", 'make', 'race', 'issue', 'here', 'where', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'rather', 'easily', 'touched', 'never', 'manner', 'feel', 'overbearing', 'Instead', 'focus', 'left', 'teachers', 'ability', 'mold', 'influence', 'young', 'minds', 'positive', 'direction', 'passion', 'soul', 'issue', 'ending', 'more', 'do', 'lack', 'true', 'development', 'change', 'students', 'film', 'hints', 'change', 'never', 'more', 'passing', 'sentiment', 'just', 'know', 'kids', 'are', 'changing', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'sense.Still', 'well-made', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'veered', 'redundancy', 'somehow', 'fresh', 'being', 'nearly', '50', 'years', 'old']",N/A

I was just thinking of writing a review of this movie and low and behold over my internet radio station, guess what song comes on.  I take this as meaning that I have to write this review.Being a Sidney fan I've attempted to write this before but found that there was way too much to say, but I'll try to pare it down. This is on my personal list as one of my favorite movies because the emotion level is much like a roller coaster ride that the emotional release in the middle and at the end is sure to bring you to tears.Without the slightest intention of staying in his newly acquired teaching post, Engineer Mark Thackery takes on the poor rough high school students of a London school who had given the previous teacher a nervous breakdown.  Being children of the uneducated working class who in many cases needed to work to help support the family giving education the back seat left many of his students repeating the same dark, hopeless cycle as their parents had.  This leaves them with little or no expectations of anything more than what their parents were experiencing.  Of course it is a very rough start for Mr. Thackery or ""chimney sweep"" as the leader of the class calls him (the substitute never gets a good start but this is really rough.)  The students try him at every turn until he finally explodes.  He then realizes that BECAUSE this is all they will ever know at this stage in their lives that they need to be prepared for life in a world that won't give you many opportunities unless you can present yourself in a manner that will allow doors to open for them to a new future.The grace and serenity of Sidney's character throughout this movie leaves the students, parents, colleagues and viewer with a sense of wonder and amazement as he is tested time and again by the class. The sense of joy at each breakthrough is as addictive as the dismay at each roadblock.  It's somehow so easy to emotionally connect with this movie because of Poitier's charisma. He meets their advances with dignity, wisdom and caring although he's determined not to get too attached since he knows another job offer will come at any time.  Although this theme has been played many times on screen it's rarely been done this exceptionally.  The ending is so  emotionally mixed that you don't know whether to dance, laugh, cry or cheer....so I do all of the above and watched it all over again!",5,"To Sir, with love.",1144108800,"04 4, 2006",2006,2417,"['freaky', 'was', 'just', 'thinking', 'writing', 'review', 'movie', 'low', 'behold', 'internet', 'radio', 'station', 'guess', 'what', 'song', 'take', 'meaning', 'have', 'write', 'review.Being', 'Sidney', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'attempted', 'write', 'found', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'say', ""'ll"", 'try', 'pare', 'down', 'personal', 'list', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'emotion', 'level', 'much', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'emotional', 'release', 'middle', 'end', 'sure', 'bring', 'tears.Without', 'slightest', 'intention', 'staying', 'newly', 'acquired', 'teaching', 'post', 'Engineer', 'Mark', 'Thackery', 'poor', 'rough', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'London', 'school', 'who', 'had', 'given', 'previous', 'teacher', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'Being', 'children', 'uneducated', 'working', 'class', 'who', 'many', 'cases', 'needed', 'work', 'help', 'support', 'family', 'giving', 'education', 'back', 'seat', 'left', 'many', 'students', 'repeating', 'same', 'dark', 'hopeless', 'cycle', 'parents', 'had', 'little', 'expectations', 'anything', 'more', 'what', 'parents', 'were', 'experiencing', 'course', 'very', 'rough', 'start', 'Mr.', 'Thackery', 'chimney', 'sweep', 'leader', 'class', 'substitute', 'never', 'good', 'start', 'really', 'rough', 'students', 'try', 'turn', 'finally', 'then', 'will', 'ever', 'know', 'stage', 'lives', 'need', 'be', 'prepared', 'life', 'world', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'many', 'opportunities', 'can', 'present', 'manner', 'will', 'allow', 'doors', 'open', 'new', 'future.The', 'grace', 'serenity', 'Sidney', 'character', 'movie', 'students', 'parents', 'colleagues', 'viewer', 'sense', 'wonder', 'amazement', 'tested', 'time', 'again', 'class', 'sense', 'joy', 'breakthrough', 'as', 'addictive', 'dismay', 'roadblock', 'somehow', 'so', 'easy', 'emotionally', 'connect', 'movie', 'Poitier', 'charisma', 'advances', 'dignity', 'wisdom', 'caring', 'determined', 'not', 'get', 'too', 'attached', 'job', 'offer', 'will', 'come', 'time', 'theme', 'been', 'played', 'many', 'times', 'screen', 'rarely', 'been', 'done', 'exceptionally', 'ending', 'so', 'emotionally', 'mixed', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'dance', 'laugh', 'cry', 'cheer', '.so', 'do', 'above', 'watched', 'over', 'again']",N/A

He knew I loved the film and would be very happy to get the CD.  He was right!First released in 1967, ""To Sir, With Love"" is a story about a hard-working (yet unemployed) engineer who opts for a teaching job in London (North Quay) to pay his bills--all the while still sending out resumes to try and find his ""real"" job.  He shows up to interview and is hired simply because he is a man; he has no real teaching experience.  He is told by a fellow teacher that he will be teaching ""the worst of the worst,"" and from day one it appears he was not told a lie.  The youth are rebellious, anti-social, push-the-envelope types (a/k/a your AVERAGE teenager), and they push about as hard as they can.  Even some of his fellow teachers seem to have given up hope on them.  The ever-hateful Weston nitpicks at anything Thackery tries to do to help his students.  Everything finally comes to a head when Mark Thackery (played masterfully by Sidney Poitier) comes into his classroom and finds the girls have decided to burn a very nasty object in the space heater.  It is then Thackery has his epiphony and decides to throw all caution to the wind and teach these youths all about what it means to have to grow up.Poitier is backed by a wonderful cast:  Judy Geeson plays Pamela, who has quite the crush on him.  Lulu plays Ms. Pegg and belts out the title tune.  Christian Roberts plays Denim, who you want to hate but can't.  The movie was directed by James Clavell (who also wrote ""Shogun"") and the running time is 105 minutes.  It is UR but contains a little language and adult themes.On a side note, the original ""To Sir, With Love"" was SUPPOSED to be set in New York, but--believe it or not--the production was moved to England because the teenagers in the States appeared too nice for Clavell's tastes!  The production was moved to England where it appeared the lads were a little tougher and meaner.  My, how things have changed since then.  This may account for some of the reviews that said they found the movie boring.I saw the movie when it was originally released in the theaters (back when the earth was still cooling).

These are most likely the earlier pressings that have the COLUMBIA CLASSICS banner.  The newer pressings from 2004 have the 3-1/2 star rating at the top and only the widescreen version on the disc.  In either case they are currently out of print due to poor sales.  I can cite one reason and that is the poor quality print transfer.  It is faded, washed out, grainy, and suffers from compression artifacting especially played on newer High Definition televisions that came out within the past couple years.  The print used may have looked great on a standard 300 line tube set but not on a 1080 HD flat screen one.  It missed Sony's re-mastering in High Definition and not quite sure why?  And I don't see a re-release on the near horizon as Sony's management are not too keen on older catalog titles.One hint for bargain hunters - I picked up a brand new factory sealed copy at a local Big Lots for $3.

""In the Heat of the Night"" might have been more socially relevant when seen today, and ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" might have been more conventionally entertaining, but ""To Sir, With Love"" was to me more intelligent, sensitive and emotional that the other two. I am amazed that Sidney was not nominated for the Oscar in 1967, but given his performances in all three films, it's obvious the voters were torn. Sidney Poitier had a year in 1967 that, due to the length of time it takes to make a film these days, may not be repeated now, that is 3 starring roles in three extremely profitable films which does not happen that quite often.That said and done, I would like to say that is a film is excellent. Poitier gives an outstanding performance as Thackeray, the new school teacher, and the kids, for the most part, were really from the East End. Aided by an excellent supporting cast including Judy Geeson as Lulu which I believe, is Scottish; and Michael Des Barres ""Gypsy,"" the kid with the ubiquitous sunglasses -- is of French aristocracy/English descent; otherwise, what you're seeing is what you get: kids from the East End.True, the script and some of the cinematography are dated, but what do you expect? The film was made towards the end 1966 and released in 1967; in many ways, it was ahead of itself. The main point, however, is not cinematic technique but character development and storyline. ""To Sir, With Love"" does portray strong characters, and does develop in a logical, positive way resulting it to be an excellent film.",5,Sidney Poitier truly shines on this film,1168560000,"01 12, 2007",2007,1632,"['Sidney', 'Poitier', 'had', 'three', 'films', 'released', '1967', 'opinion', 'was', 'best', 'Heat', 'Night', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'socially', 'relevant', 'when', 'seen', 'today', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'conventionally', 'entertaining', 'Sir', 'Love', 'was', 'more', 'intelligent', 'sensitive', 'emotional', 'other', 'two', 'am', 'amazed', 'Sidney', 'was', 'not', 'nominated', 'Oscar', '1967', 'given', 'performances', 'three', 'films', 'obvious', 'voters', 'were', 'torn', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'had', 'year', '1967', 'due', 'length', 'time', 'make', 'film', 'days', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'repeated', 'now', '3', 'starring', 'roles', 'three', 'extremely', 'profitable', 'films', 'not', 'happen', 'quite', 'said', 'done', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'film', 'excellent', 'Poitier', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Thackeray', 'new', 'school', 'teacher', 'kids', 'most', 'part', 'were', 'really', 'East', 'End', 'Aided', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Judy', 'Geeson', 'Lulu', 'believe', 'Scottish', 'Michael', 'Des', 'Barres', 'Gypsy', 'kid', 'ubiquitous', 'sunglasses', 'French', 'aristocracy/English', 'descent', 'otherwise', 'what', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'what', 'get', 'kids', 'East', 'End.True', 'script', 'cinematography', 'are', 'dated', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'end', '1966', 'released', '1967', 'many', 'ways', 'was', 'ahead', 'main', 'point', 'however', 'not', 'cinematic', 'technique', 'character', 'development', 'storyline', 'Sir', 'Love', 'portray', 'strong', 'characters', 'develop', 'logical', 'positive', 'way', 'resulting', 'be', 'excellent', 'film']",N/A

Everyone in the class is seriously deficient;no Oxford aspirants here. So, Mark literally throws away the books and attempts to teach social skills, much to the chagrin of many faculty members,too burned out or sarcastic, no longer able or willing to put up much of a fight. Inner city teachers circa 2008 please take note. The saddest commentary in the film is the further deterioration of the public schools since Lulu sang her last note. There is nary a knife to be seen, no guns, no bombs, no wanton gang atttacks.

545358,A20Z1PKIH0PFUF,B00003L9C1,JoeyD,"[9, 10]","Has there ever been actor who had a better year than Sir Sidney did in 1967?  It's hard to believe that he wasn't even nominated for an Oscar that year.  The man starred in three classic films - ""In the Heat of the Night"", ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" and of course this enjoyable, little gem - ""To Sir With Love"" all in 67.""To Sir With Love"" is one of those films that is almost impossible not to like.  You may argue if it deserves the label of a true classic, but there's no denying how sweet and entertaining this fine film is.  Based on the true story by E.R. Braithwaite (I highly recommend the book as well), Sidney Poitier absolutely shines in the role of Mark Thackeray (a.k.a. 'Sir'), a young man who after searching unsuccessfully for work as an engineer opts to take a job as a teacher at a rough, East End London high school.  The rookie teacher immediately finds himself in a hornet's nest, as his poor, obnoxious students try their very best to break the man.  However, Sir is not a man to be broken, and eventually he is able to transform the beastly brutes and tasteless tarts into real gentlemen and ladies.  Poitier simply lights up the screen as 'Sir', a man who is able to teach these troubled, frustrated, angst-ridden youths what it means to be a dignified, respectful member of the human race.I love this movie.  Yes, it's a bit dated, and those churlish of critics might wish to scoff at it being too schmaltzy and saccharine for their tastes.  However, even the most callous of critics agree that as overly sweet as this film is, it's still thoroughly enjoyable.  On top of the great work of Sir Sidney, you've got the adorable Judy Geeson turning in a fine performance as Pamela Dare, the class beauty who can't help but fall head-over-heals for the sophisticated 'Sir'.  Lulu may not be the greatest of actresses, but she sure can sing and who among us doesn't love that unforgettable title song.  ""Why is it Sir, that children grow up to be people one day...""Just a side note, in the actual book by Braithwhite, Sir and Gillian Blanchard (played by the stunningly beautiful, Sharon Tate look-alike Suzy Kendall) fall in love and end up getting married.  However, we all know that Sidney and Hollywood were already pushing the envelope that year with ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"".  So in this film, the two remain close friends, but there is unfortunately no romance.  Alas, another sign of those turbulent times of the 60's...This is a film that your whole family can watch and enjoy together.  It's a shame they don't make 'sweet' movies like this anymore.  Every once in a while, we disenchanted folk need upbeat, cheerful films like this to keep us sane and bring us a little good cheer.  This one I can guaranty will put a smile on your face.

And I normally avoid the ""teacher saves his students"" movies such as ""Stand and Deliver"" and ""Lean On Me,"" because even if they're based on true stories they all tend to be the same predicable fare.  Teacher faces a class/school of difficult/uneducated/underprivileged/all three students, faces opposition from both students and fellow faculty, wins students' respect, and manages to turn the kids around and become a hero.  (No, I'm not cynical, but these movies are incredibly predictable...)""To Sir, With Love"" is probably one of the first of these ""teacher saves students"" movies, and if it's a bit predictable, it's because it set the stage for many others to come.  And though it treads familiar ground, it's a powerful and heartfelt film.Sidney Poitier plays Mark Thackery, an engineer who turns to teaching while he looks for a job suited to his education.  He ends up in a secondary school in London's poor East End, and is saddled with a class of rowdy students who have frightened off every other teacher to come their way.  Thackery knows he has his work cut out for him, but he buckles down anyhow, taking no nonsense or bad behavior from his students and doing his best to teach them the necessary skills for the adult world.  The students rebel at first, seeking to break Thackery as they've broken every other teacher... but a little respect goes a long way, and soon the students find themselves warming up to their new teacher, and wanting to change for the better.This is a classic, and deservedly so.  Sidney Poitier does a magnificent job in the lead role, commanding respect and yet able to show genuine emotion when necessary.  The students themselves seem like real people, not the caricatures that often populate ""teen"" movies nowadays.  Most of the other adults, teachers and parents alike, are mostly background characters or serve to prop up individual scenes, but they play their necessary roles well.  It's Poitier that's the star of the show, after all, and they do nothing to steal his thunder from him.The musical score is rather understated compared the often-overwhelming soundtracks of today's movies, but it does a great deal to highlight the genuinely emotional moments and doesn't overpower the quieter moments.The story itself, sadly, is rather predictable.  This is NOT the fault of the movie -- it's the fault of the tidal wave of imitators that have been made over the years, to the point where ""teacher saves students"" movies are eye-rollingly clich&eacute;-ridden and tiresome anymore.  ""To Sir, With Love"" is still a powerful film, but it's been carbon-copied so much that the story has been told and retold until it's become threadbare.  Which is a shame.Despite the predictable story, this movie is still well-worth a look, not only as a period piece but for Poitier's wonderful acting job.

I could have plans and I just cancel them, how can I go out when TO SIR WITH LOVE is on and even though I'e seen it probably 40 times it's so brilliantly constructed that I can never remember how it ends.  Will Thackeray (""Sir"") take a job with civil engineering?  Or will he stay in the horrid slum school he's been assigned to?  Either way it would be a brilliant movie, mostly because of the writing I guess, but also it's superbly directed by someone who really loves kids, for each of the young actors in the film has a different personality, and each of them gets to shine.  Of course Lulu has a big part, and she's pretty bad at acting, yet she's so over the top I always think, Well, maybe there were actually slags that loud and vulgar.  The young actor who plays ""Denham,"" Thackeray's nemesis, is sort of like Britain's answer to our own Michael Parks, both of them eye candy of a specialized sort, and above all the other youngsters is Judy Geeson, forever immortal for her playing of Pamela Dare, the one student who really gives her heart to Sir, for he's the only one who has given her a reason to think of herself as a human being.  Every year that goes by she looks more beautiful and her outfits more trendy and fetching.  Just tonight I was watching the big schoolyard scene where Denham throws the tin can at Sir, cutting his palm, and the kids are saying, ""Look, Chimney Sweep is bleeding red blood,"" and Pamela has a fit screaming at them how racist they are.  Anyhow she's wearing, well is it supposed to be a slum outfit?

545373,AAW58LG72PG7I,B00003L9C1,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[1, 2]","In TO SIR, WITH LOVE director James Clavell recreates a world that is timeless in its rich connotations of a collision of values between a working class and partly thuggish group of east London high school seniors and a dedicated teacher who is determined to give them vitally needed survival skills of which they are only dimly aware.  Sidney Poitier is Mark Thackeray, an out of work engineer who agrees to teach only due to financial straits.  What occurs in his class has been covered before and since in films like BLACKBOARD JUNGLE and DANGEROUS MINDS, but in Clavell's masterful hands, the result is a near perfect blending of many seemingly disparate elements that somehow fuse into a classic.Poitier faces a group of tough kids who want to like him but have been conditioned to give all teachers a hard time.  As if peeling away the many delicate strands of an onion, Poitier similarly reveals the teen angst that is surely a universal condition regardless of economic status.  The film has too many moments of understated power that in the hands of a lesser director might have gone for the overkill, but Poitier, ably assisted by Judy Geeson as a beautiful Pamela Dare and Suzy Kendall as an equally lovely teacher co-worker, all manage to bounce off each other at just the right moment.  Where the hoodlums in BLACKBOARD JUNGLE were vile, in Thackeray's class were hiding their inner fears under surface petty disruptions.  From the opening reel to the last you simply knew that this was a magical film populated by idealistic types like Poitier and Kendall or unruly students whose unruliness was a mask.Other reviewers have suggested that the look and feel of the film give it a dated aspect.  This may be true but being dated need not be a flaw.  In the closing scene at the graduation dance, all the pieces meld into a thoroughly enjoyable whole.  The Beatle-type look of the band, the sixties-style frugging, the look on Judy Geeson's face as she dances with Poitier, and the stirring lyrics by Lulu all coalesce into a timeless tribute to the cusp between crayon and perfume.  In its own way, TO SIR WITH LOVE is one of those magical movies that announce to an often unready and unlistening world that a new generation is about to make its mark.",5,A Stirring Tribute to From Crayons to Perfume,1195948800,"11 25, 2007",2007,2263,"['TO', 'SIR', 'WITH', 'LOVE', 'director', 'James', 'Clavell', 'world', 'timeless', 'rich', 'connotations', 'collision', 'values', 'working', 'class', 'partly', 'thuggish', 'group', 'east', 'London', 'high', 'school', 'seniors', 'dedicated', 'teacher', 'who', 'determined', 'give', 'vitally', 'needed', 'survival', 'skills', 'are', 'only', 'dimly', 'aware', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'Mark', 'Thackeray', 'out', 'work', 'engineer', 'who', 'teach', 'only', 'due', 'financial', 'straits', 'What', 'class', 'been', 'covered', 'films', 'BLACKBOARD', 'JUNGLE', 'DANGEROUS', 'MINDS', 'Clavell', 'masterful', 'hands', 'result', 'near', 'perfect', 'blending', 'many', 'seemingly', 'disparate', 'elements', 'somehow', 'fuse', 'classic.Poitier', 'group', 'tough', 'kids', 'who', 'want', 'like', 'have', 'been', 'conditioned', 'give', 'teachers', 'hard', 'time', 'peeling', 'away', 'many', 'delicate', 'strands', 'onion', 'Poitier', 'similarly', 'teen', 'angst', 'surely', 'universal', 'condition', 'regardless', 'economic', 'status', 'film', 'too', 'many', 'moments', 'understated', 'power', 'hands', 'lesser', 'director', 'might', 'have', 'gone', 'overkill', 'Poitier', 'ably', 'assisted', 'Judy', 'Geeson', 'beautiful', 'Pamela', 'Dare', 'Suzy', 'Kendall', 'equally', 'lovely', 'co-worker', 'manage', 'bounce', 'off', 'other', 'just', 'right', 'moment', 'Where', 'hoodlums', 'BLACKBOARD', 'JUNGLE', 'were', 'vile', 'Thackeray', 'class', 'were', 'hiding', 'inner', 'fears', 'surface', 'petty', 'disruptions', 'opening', 'reel', 'last', 'simply', 'knew', 'was', 'magical', 'film', 'populated', 'idealistic', 'types', 'Poitier', 'Kendall', 'unruly', 'students', 'unruliness', 'was', 'mask.Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'suggested', 'look', 'feel', 'film', 'give', 'dated', 'aspect', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'being', 'dated', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'flaw', 'closing', 'scene', 'graduation', 'dance', 'pieces', 'meld', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'whole', 'Beatle-type', 'look', 'band', 'sixties-style', 'frugging', 'look', 'Judy', 'Geeson', 'face', 'Poitier', 'stirring', 'lyrics', 'Lulu', 'coalesce', 'timeless', 'tribute', 'cusp', 'crayon', 'perfume', 'own', 'way', 'TO', 'SIR', 'WITH', 'LOVE', 'one', 'magical', 'movies', 'announce', 'often', 'unready', 'unlistening', 'world', 'new', 'generation', 'make', 'mark']",N/A

545386,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00003L9C1,Only-A-Child,"[4, 5]","""To Sir With Love"" (1967) could be considered a blue collar and contemporary ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"" (1969) or an urban ""Mr. Holland's Opus"". I was entertained but unimpressed when I saw it in a theatre at the time of its release. At the time the film was simply too obvious in its attempt to cash in on the hot issues that were being embraced at that time. Anything British was super cool, race relations was the ""in"" topic-especially things dealing with the plight of blacks, Lulu's hit title song was being played incessantly on all the pop stations, Judy Geeson was suddenly every guy's dream girl, and Christan Roberts was obviously intended to draw teen girl's to the theatre.Surprisingly the film has held up remarkably well and somehow seems far less contrived. In part this is because I have learned that the novel (of the same title) from which it was adapted, was written by a cultured black man (E.R. Braithwaite) who taught similar students in a similar East End London public school. In addition, the story is timeless as educational systems continue to pigeon-hole students at an early age, steering the least promising into dead-end programs where little is done to tap whatever potential they may have for learning.That's basically the film's story as out-of-work engineer Mark Thackeray (Sidney Poitier) takes what he hopes will be a temporary job at an East End school. His class is the one nobody wants, full of students who have no apparent aptitude or interest in anything academic. They are in their last year (British schools set this type of student loose on the world at age 15 but these students look several years older) and just killing time until they can leave school at the end of the term. These are not the JD's of ""Blackboard Jungle"" (a 1955 Poitier film) but a real socio-economic segment of British society.Thackeray quickly sizes up the situation and realizes that he can do nothing to make up for years of low expectations. So he starts teaching them basic manners, survival skills, and how to behave as responsible adults; things that will soon be useful to them. And they quickly recognize this and for the first time actually become attentive to a teacher and his lessons.More importantly, he gives them a role model, a poor black man who worked hard, paid his dues, and transformed himself into someone they consider cultured and literate. They have been tagged as losers by the educational system but Thackeray opens their eyes to other possibilities.Of course Lulu sings the excellent title song, which is nicely connected to the actual story, and does a surprisingly good job of acting for the camera. The film's best moment is the field trip to the museum creatively illustrated by a montage of still photos accompanied by a version of the title song. ""The Mindbenders"", a contemporary pop group (""Groovy Kind of Love"") contribute a couple songs and actually appear briefly at a dance gig.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.Those schoolgirl days, of telling tales and biting nails are gone, But in my mind, I know they will still live on and on, But how do you thank someone, who has taken you from crayons to perfume? It isn't easy, but I'll try,If you wanted the sky I would write across the sky in letters, That would soar a thousand feet high, To Sir, with LoveThe time has come, For closing books and long last looks must end, And as I leave, I know that I am leaving my best friend, A friend who taught me right from wrong, And weak from strong, That's a lot to learn, What, what can I give you in return?If you wanted the moon I would try to make a start, But I, would rather you let me give my heart, To Sir, with Love",5,Better Than I Remembered,1193702400,"10 30, 2007",2007,3691,"['Sir', 'Love', '1967', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'blue', 'collar', 'contemporary', 'Prime', 'Miss', 'Jean', 'Brodie', '1969', 'urban', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'Opus', 'was', 'entertained', 'unimpressed', 'when', 'saw', 'theatre', 'time', 'release', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'simply', 'too', 'obvious', 'attempt', 'cash', 'hot', 'issues', 'were', 'being', 'embraced', 'time', 'Anything', 'British', 'was', 'super', 'cool', 'race', 'relations', 'was', 'topic-especially', 'things', 'dealing', 'plight', 'blacks', 'Lulu', 'hit', 'title', 'song', 'was', 'being', 'played', 'incessantly', 'pop', 'stations', 'Judy', 'Geeson', 'was', 'suddenly', 'guy', 'dream', 'girl', 'Christan', 'Roberts', 'was', 'obviously', 'intended', 'draw', 'teen', 'girl', 'theatre.Surprisingly', 'film', 'held', 'up', 'remarkably', 'well', 'somehow', 'far', 'less', 'contrived', 'part', 'have', 'learned', 'novel', 'same', 'title', 'was', 'adapted', 'was', 'written', 'cultured', 'black', 'man', 'E.R', 'Braithwaite', 'who', 'taught', 'similar', 'students', 'similar', 'East', 'End', 'London', 'public', 'school', 'addition', 'story', 'timeless', 'educational', 'systems', 'continue', 'pigeon-hole', 'students', 'early', 'age', 'steering', 'least', 'promising', 'dead-end', 'programs', 'where', 'little', 'done', 'tap', 'potential', 'may', 'have', 'basically', 'film', 'story', 'out-of-work', 'engineer', 'Mark', 'Thackeray', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'temporary', 'job', 'East', 'End', 'school', 'class', 'one', 'nobody', 'full', 'students', 'who', 'have', 'apparent', 'aptitude', 'interest', 'anything', 'academic', 'are', 'last', 'year', 'British', 'schools', 'set', 'type', 'student', 'loose', 'world', 'age', '15', 'students', 'look', 'several', 'years', 'older', 'just', 'killing', 'time', 'can', 'leave', 'school', 'end', 'term', 'are', 'not', 'JD', 'Blackboard', 'Jungle', '1955', 'Poitier', 'film', 'real', 'socio-economic', 'segment', 'British', 'society.Thackeray', 'quickly', 'up', 'situation', 'can', 'do', 'nothing', 'make', 'up', 'years', 'low', 'expectations', 'teaching', 'basic', 'manners', 'survival', 'skills', 'how', 'behave', 'responsible', 'adults', 'things', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'useful', 'quickly', 'recognize', 'first', 'time', 'actually', 'become', 'attentive', 'teacher', 'lessons.More', 'importantly', 'role', 'model', 'poor', 'black', 'man', 'who', 'worked', 'hard', 'paid', 'dues', 'transformed', 'someone', 'consider', 'cultured', 'literate', 'have', 'been', 'tagged', 'losers', 'educational', 'system', 'Thackeray', 'eyes', 'other', 'possibilities.Of', 'course', 'Lulu', 'excellent', 'title', 'song', 'nicely', 'connected', 'actual', 'story', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'job', 'acting', 'camera', 'film', 'best', 'moment', 'field', 'trip', 'museum', 'creatively', 'illustrated', 'montage', 'still', 'photos', 'accompanied', 'version', 'title', 'song', 'Mindbenders', 'contemporary', 'pop', 'group', 'Groovy', 'Kind', 'Love', 'contribute', 'couple', 'songs', 'actually', 'appear', 'briefly', 'dance', 'gig.Then', 'again', 'what', 'do', 'know', ""'m"", 'only', 'child.Those', 'schoolgirl', 'days', 'telling', 'tales', 'biting', 'nails', 'are', 'gone', 'mind', 'know', 'will', 'still', 'live', 'how', 'do', 'thank', 'someone', 'who', 'taken', 'crayons', 'perfume', ""n't"", 'easy', ""'ll"", 'try', 'wanted', 'sky', 'would', 'write', 'sky', 'letters', 'would', 'soar', 'thousand', 'feet', 'high', 'Sir', 'LoveThe', 'time', 'come', 'closing', 'books', 'long', 'last', 'looks', 'must', 'end', 'leave', 'know', 'am', 'leaving', 'best', 'friend', 'A', 'friend', 'who', 'taught', 'right', 'wrong', 'weak', 'strong', 'lot', 'learn', 'What', 'what', 'can', 'give', 'return', 'wanted', 'moon', 'would', 'try', 'make', 'start', 'would', 'rather', 'let', 'give', 'heart', 'Sir', 'Love']",N/A

Sidney Poitier gave one of his finest and truly stellar performances as the novice teacher, Mr. Mark Thackeray, who had to practically ""comandeer"" all those rowdy and undisciplined students (punks of East End London) and transformed them all to responsible and respectable adults, as they got ready to face the world, where they will either stand on their own two feet or fall flat on their faces. The theme song, ""To Sir With Love,"" sang by Lulu, ""Those school ... days of telling tales and biting nails...."" made me reminisce my very own high school days back in the late 50s and early 60s at the Saint Augustine's School in Tagudin, Ilocos Sur, Philippines where I graduated from high school. For me personally, ""To Sir With Love"", involving rowdy, misbehaved, and disrespectful students in a slum neighborhood in East End London, was both very persuasive and very powerful. This movie truly and magnanimously captured the very essence of humanity in the persona of Mr. Mark Thackeray and the ""East End"" students. The final school days scene, when the students honored their ""Sir"" with that powerful song (which was also the title) and showed him all their love and admiration for transforming all of them to responsible, mature, respectable and best of all LOVABLE and DECENT human beings, provided a very emotional moment not only for Mr. Thackeray and other members of the teaching staff.  This remarkable scene in the movie truly moved me to tears. This movie has a very powerful message in that educational institutions all need a Mr. Mark Thackeray to meet all the challenges which undisciplined, rowdy, disrespectful, and truly misbehaved students present not only in their classrooms but also in the outside world and to change, nurture, and transform many, if not all of them, to mature, responsible, and respectful persons who represent the future of this universe! ...I was practically one of those students who ""fell in love"" with Sir.

545396,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,B00003L9C1,Roger J. Buffington,"[25, 27]","Somehow I just missed this one when it came out during my youth.  I recently caught it on Satellite and immediately ordered the DVD.  This is a wonderful, powerful film featuring a fabulous performance by Sidney Portier.  I have caught Portier in a few other films, and he was excellent in all of them, but his performance in this film is quite simply magnificent.  His class, intense intelligence, and talent all shine through in this moving story of a teacher who touches a classroom full of lower-class Brits and leaves them the better for it.The storyline is well-known, so I shan't dwell on it in this review.  Who among us has not had the good fortune of encountering, in our young years, a particularly gifted teacher who perhaps sets us on the right course despite ourselves?  That is what this story is about.  Portier (playing Mr. Thackary, to be addressed as ""Sir!"") is assigned to teach a tough classroom of young working class Brits, who are about to graduate and enter the workforce.  The pupils are poorly educated and thuggish.  Thackary quickly realizes that their real problem is that they lack a moral and social compass, or any appreciation of the value of an education.  He confronts the class, and inspires most of them to steer a more proper course in life.  This is a fine story of teenage angst, growing up, and the important role that a gifted teacher can play in a young life. An underlying and inspiring theme, of course, is the fact that Portier plays a black man immersed in a nearly completely white school at a time when Western society had a long way to go as regards racial equality.  He encounters prejudice, but transcends it by his talent, intelligence, and force of personality.  Eventually the class comes to fully appreciate the extraordinary nature of their teacher. Similarly, Mr. Thackary,  who originally had accepted the teaching post while searching for a job as an engineer, comes to know that his true calling and talent is teaching.  It does not matter how hard-boiled the viewer, no one can fail to be touched by the ending of this superb film.This is a stylish flick set more or less in the Beatles age of the 1960s.  The British nature of the film, the British setting, etc. has a special fascination to the American viewer, and of course when this film was released, the British pop ""invasion"" was in full swing.  This, combined with Portier's incomparable performance, the solid storyline of this film, and really good acting by an appealing British cast, made this low-budget film a smash hit. Of course, the theme song ""To Sir With Love"" by Lulu is a sentimental and touching component of the film, which became a top rock tune in the States.I purchased my DVD in May 2005.  Some reviewers apparently received copies that erroneously had a Japanese monster movie on Side B.  My copy did not have this error, so the publisher has evidently corrected the problem.  The sound and colors on my copy are excellent; the remastering was well-doneToo many films are rated 5 stars here on Amazon, but this is one for sure.  One indicator of a truly fine film is how it stands the test of time, and whether the viewer returns to it repeatedly.  This film passes these tests with flying colors (or should I say ""colours""?).",5,"Powerful, sentimental, wonderfully done",1117843200,"06 4, 2005",2005,3268,"['Somehow', 'just', 'missed', 'one', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'youth', 'recently', 'caught', 'Satellite', 'immediately', 'ordered', 'DVD', 'wonderful', 'powerful', 'film', 'featuring', 'fabulous', 'performance', 'Sidney', 'Portier', 'have', 'caught', 'Portier', 'few', 'other', 'films', 'was', 'excellent', 'performance', 'film', 'quite', 'simply', 'magnificent', 'class', 'intense', 'intelligence', 'talent', 'shine', 'moving', 'story', 'teacher', 'who', 'classroom', 'full', 'lower-class', 'Brits', 'better', 'it.The', 'storyline', 'well-known', 'sha', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'review', 'Who', 'not', 'had', 'good', 'fortune', 'encountering', 'young', 'years', 'particularly', 'gifted', 'teacher', 'who', 'perhaps', 'right', 'course', 'ourselves', 'what', 'story', 'about', 'Portier', 'playing', 'Mr.', 'Thackary', 'be', 'addressed', 'Sir', 'assigned', 'teach', 'tough', 'classroom', 'young', 'working', 'class', 'Brits', 'who', 'are', 'graduate', 'enter', 'workforce', 'pupils', 'are', 'poorly', 'educated', 'thuggish', 'Thackary', 'quickly', 'real', 'problem', 'lack', 'moral', 'social', 'compass', 'appreciation', 'value', 'education', 'class', 'most', 'steer', 'more', 'proper', 'course', 'life', 'fine', 'story', 'teenage', 'angst', 'growing', 'up', 'important', 'role', 'gifted', 'teacher', 'can', 'play', 'young', 'life', 'underlying', 'inspiring', 'theme', 'course', 'fact', 'Portier', 'black', 'man', 'immersed', 'nearly', 'completely', 'white', 'school', 'time', 'when', 'Western', 'society', 'had', 'long', 'way', 'go', 'regards', 'racial', 'equality', 'prejudice', 'talent', 'intelligence', 'force', 'personality', 'Eventually', 'class', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'extraordinary', 'nature', 'teacher', 'Similarly', 'Mr.', 'Thackary', 'who', 'originally', 'had', 'accepted', 'teaching', 'post', 'searching', 'job', 'engineer', 'know', 'true', 'calling', 'talent', 'teaching', 'not', 'matter', 'how', 'hard-boiled', 'viewer', 'one', 'can', 'fail', 'be', 'touched', 'ending', 'superb', 'film.This', 'stylish', 'flick', 'set', 'more', 'less', 'Beatles', 'age', '1960s', 'British', 'nature', 'film', 'British', 'setting', 'etc', 'special', 'fascination', 'American', 'viewer', 'course', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'British', 'pop', 'invasion', 'was', 'full', 'swing', 'combined', 'Portier', 'incomparable', 'performance', 'solid', 'storyline', 'film', 'really', 'good', 'acting', 'appealing', 'British', 'cast', 'made', 'low-budget', 'film', 'smash', 'hit', 'course', 'theme', 'song', 'Sir', 'Love', 'Lulu', 'sentimental', 'touching', 'component', 'film', 'became', 'top', 'rock', 'tune', 'States.I', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'May', '2005', 'reviewers', 'apparently', 'received', 'copies', 'erroneously', 'had', 'Japanese', 'monster', 'movie', 'Side', 'B', 'copy', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'error', 'publisher', 'evidently', 'corrected', 'problem', 'sound', 'colors', 'copy', 'are', 'excellent', 'remastering', 'was', 'well-doneToo', 'many', 'films', 'are', 'rated', '5', 'stars', 'here', 'Amazon', 'one', 'sure', 'One', 'indicator', 'truly', 'fine', 'film', 'how', 'test', 'time', 'viewer', 'repeatedly', 'film', 'tests', 'flying', 'colors', 'should', 'say', 'colours']",N/A

As the subject matter is increasingly used, many times the performances and roles become overly one dimensional.

Pointier eventually wins these students overs and sufficiently prepares them (his goal) for the outside ""adult"" world.This is a great movie about the trials and tribulations about being a teacher. It's a great drama and the famed song ""To Sir with Love"" is a perfect vehicle for the film.The story is great, the student actors are wonderful and, most of all, Poitier comes across so earnest and honorable, that he is a joy to watch.There is a great scene where he is eating an orange for lunch and a fellow teacher inquires ""why such a light lunch"".

At least until he can land his dream job in the engineering field. The teenagers that he winds-up teaching, are incorrigible delinquents, from the rough slums of London's east-end.Thackeray gets off to a bad start, while trying to gain the respect of his troubled students. As a black man, he also has the additional problem of winning the respect of the white students, who haven't had to answer to a black teacher before. And most of them harbor some underlying racial animosity, towards Thackeray.After a particularly bad day in the classroom, Mark decides to try a new approach, to getting through to his students. He goes to the skeptical Headmaster, and proposes the idea of taking his students on field trips to museums, and other culturally educational places. Though he's reluctant, the Headmaster decides to grant Thackeray permission, for the field trip program.The students begin to thrive, due to these field trips. And also because Thackeray teaches the teens self respect, and treats them like adults, rather than like juvenile delinquents. The students start looking up to Mark, especially troubled teen Pamela Dare. When Mark gets a great engineering job offer, he's torn between taking that job, and continuing in his new teaching career, at the high school.Sidney Poitier gives a flawless performance, as Mark Thackeray. Poitier portrays his Thackeray character, with an air of stern dignity, as well as genuine compassion. The supporting cast shines too. Especially Judy Geeson, as the angst-ridden Pamela Dare. This film is buoyed by featuring lots of exciting rock music, and by the crackling energy, of the talented cast.

Released at a time when the world was captivated by all things British, it was relatively daring at the time it was made.

But the biggest profit of all is his portrayal of the East End school teacher, Mark Thackery, who quickly learns that his students need a different kind of education than that of a textbook. It has been, unfairly or not, relentlessly compared to *The Blackboard Jungle*, and it is a blood-relation to *Up the Down Staircase* and *Dangerous Minds*.

545409,APRAUZ9Z7X4PI,B00003L9C1,"talkytina ""talkytina""","[12, 13]","Once again, Sidney Poitier transcends racial stereotypes, and provides us an important lesson in life.  This time, he emerges as simply a good man who earns the love and respect of his students.  1967 was a  memorable year for Poitier who starred in three, countem' three, box office hits.  Perhaps the most penetrating line ever uttered in Poitier's distinguished career was in the same year: &quot;They call me Mr. Tibbs!&quot;, he said, with a flare that is still haunting.  &quot;To Sir With Love&quot; provides this truly sophisticated actor a much different setting to showcase his wisdom.  Here, Poitier displays his natual gift for teaching as he politely but firmly tames a classroom full of London's most obnoxious bongholes.  The situation intensifies when the quietly determined, novice school teacher insists that the potential hoodlums (who he is trying to rescue from the difficulties of being teenagers) change their self destructive behavior.  Things get worse before they get better, and a powerful drama (and some fine acting) unfolds in the process.  Audiences in 1967 gasped when Poitier showed up with his fiance at the dinner table of Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.  Likewise, &quot;To Sir With Love&quot; audiences exhaled a collective sigh of relief when Poitier put aside his romantic interest in a favorite fair skinned pupil. Many of today's audiences are not enthusiastic about inter-racial dating and marriages either, but content of character (in such awkward situations) is certainly more of an overall consideration.  Poitier's influence on American culture and its expanded capacity for tolerance cannot be underestimated.  His presence on the big screen was the first time many people had experienced an Afro American who so modestly but effectively demanded treatment with dignity.  Poitier has excellent command of the English language, and speaks his mind freely and fluently. It's a far cry from the typically demeaning and distasteful screen images of today, especially those with predominantly black casts.  Afro Americans are often portrayed as deceitful, immoral, foul mouthed hoodlums who practically deserve whatever punk fate they get. If this trend is to be reversed, the very actors whose livlihoods are at stake must refuse to represent the Afro American community in this manner.

Itself an imitator of earlier movies, such as ""Blackboard Jungle"" in which Sidney was a student, not the teacher, it has had dozens if not scores of would-be successors as ""the"" flick about unorthodox teachers saving troubled students. However, I can't think of any which have come after that I wanted to see twice---not ""Up the Down Staircase"" or ""Dangerous Minds"" or the one about the calculus teacher or the one about Principal Joe Clark or the one with Jim Belushi or the one with Tom Berenger as the substitute or even the recent one with Hillary Swank, which was pretty good once it got going. ""To Sir With Love"" is the standout in a very large group. It had cast chemistry and charm and sweetness and an offbeat innocence.
