1308450,A1DQEYIQ9FK3JL,B002ZG98R8,"Asa Bunnett ""Verboseman""","[6, 9]","I had the (mis?)fortune of seeing Red Dawn on opening day.  My original intent was to see the movie with a group of friends.  Plans fell through, which was unfortunate, because it turned out to the kind of film that makes one want to make snide remarks to the person next to you.  Given all the sarcastic, MST3K-esque riffing I wanted to do on the film while watching it, Red Dawn will surely be a fantastic film to rent on a bad movie night with you and any budding cynics you know.  Without the benefit of satirical commentary layered on top like sweet sprinkles on a burnt, stale confectionary, though, the movie loses almost all appeal.Despite a pretty decent cast, including Chris Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson, nobody seems to care that they're even in this film.  It's clearly an ""I just need my paycheck"" situation for most of these actors, and none of them put forth any effort to inject their characters with any likeability, or any real identity at all.  I can't imagine they've been given much to work with from the writers, but that doesn't exactly give them a free pass to coast through the films interminable running time.Beyond being a mere bad film, though, Red Dawn is unique in just how out of place it feels in today's culture.  What would have made at least some sense in the `80's now comes off as comically far-fetched in the remake.  The sight of hundreds of North Korean paratroopers landing in a white-bread American suburb no longer invokes the latent fear surrounding the Cold War, but merely raises eyebrows at its implausibility.  If this was merely meant to be a goofy thrill ride, it might be easy to ignore, but the film spends its entire length in wide-eyed certainty of the world it's created.  Clearly, we are meant to think THIS COULD HAPPEN.Little needs to be said about the plot that can't be summarized in a few sentences.  North Korea invades the US.  The nation is steamrolled.  Our group of plucky young Americans fights back.  Characters are broadly-stroked splashes of color, with little depth beyond a specific character trait we can identify them by (The Leader, The Rebel, The Brains, The... erm... Blond Girl?).  As the story progresses, they all learn lessons about Heroism, Family, and Love.  Also, Guns.  Lots of guns.If anything, that's one thing the movie gets right.  Those involved in making Red Dawn seem to have hit on the fact that they have crafted the perfect fantasy for anyone who ever invented a heroic story for their toy soldiers.  The pace is as relentless as a ten-year-old making his little tale of crazy heroism.  Guns are followed by more guns, explosions by bigger explosions, car chases by more reckless chases in army transports, all topped with an ever-increasing atmosphere of frenzied action and wanton destruction.

And their administration of justice? What about the Soviet Spetznas commander, and his imposition of martial law, as portrayed by uber Bad Guy William Smith in the original? In this version, we see the blue beret SpecOps commander, but he's meaningless in the movie. Which, of course in the original, led to the invaders' commander having grave second thoughts about their purpose. COM-PUH-LETELY ignored on this version. Which kind of negates the MAIN plot point of the original.""This movie sucked, big time.""Add to that the absolutely and completely absurd premise that North Korea -- which can't even invade adjoining SOUTH Korea -- successfully invaded US!!!!!You kidding me?

It's not nostalgia for the 80's hit that I base my comments on but rather the messages and every-American heroism, patriotism, rugged-individualism, and freedom that contributed to the original's charm that were lacking in this retelling. The characters weren't as deeply developed, instead we got more special effects.  Another complaint was that the vast and cinematic Colorado wilderness shots were replaced with a none-to-far-away urban landscape where our heroes could easily sneak into a Subway, thrift store, or auto garage to resupply.  It was also disappointing that instead of only getting real military expertise/help later in their war the Wolverines were lead by an experienced Marine combat veteran right from the get-go.

1308517,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B002ZG98R8,Chris Kennison,"[4, 8]","Okay, I've read some reviews that say you can't compare this 2013 ""Red Dawn"" to the 80's ""Red Dawn"", but of course you can. It is what the creators of the film did. They took the original film directed by John Milius, starring Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell, Charlie Sheen, Lea Thompson and Jennifer Grey and recreated it. So of course you can compare the two movies.The 80's ""Red Dawn"" wasn't a great film to begin with, but it happened to have some big stars before ""Dirty Dancing"", before ""Soul Man"", before ""Back to the Future"" and before everything Charlie Sheen did. It also had a director that had tact. Remember that word ""TACT"", because very few in Hollywood actually have this long forgotten directorial trait. The premise of both ""Red Dawn"" films is a stretch, but Milius makes it believable somehow. Why? Because he had tact. He cared about the characters he was portraying. He walked us through their reluctance to leave their families behind. He walked us through their first taste of fighting back against the invaders and you could feel their immaturity as they took their first life. He relied on a great actor like Harry Dean Stanton to deliver one of the most important and powerful scenes as he talks to his sons through the POW fence, only to yell, ""Boys! Avenge me! Avenge me!"" As he's taken away.The new 2013 ""Red Dawn"" had none of this. It has no personality. It is so void of personality, a guy like me, who loves action movies lost interest within 25 minutes. The fact that this movie, directed by stunt man Dan Bradley in his directorial debut is ranked even close to the original or even close to mediocre is a perfect example why these feeling-challenged films keep getting made. Hollywood keeps puking them out and people keep accepting it.Sorry Hollywood. I'm not a puppet. I'm tired of these movies. It's a sad and embarrassing shame that every time I want to watch a real action movie, I have to go to my dvd/bluray collection of 80s movies. Action movies these days are like watching somebody else play a video game and tell you how great they are. I'm done with them. It's also a sad state of affairs that the list of the good action movies in the last 10 years is so short. ""Batman Begins"", ""Dark Knight"", ""Dark Knight Rises"" ""Kick-Ass"" ""Skyfall"", ""The Avengers"", ""X-Men: First Class"", ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"", ""Jack Reacher"", ""Last Stand"", ""Thor"", ""Star Trek"", ""The Amazing Spiderman"".

1308530,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B002ZG98R8,C. Sawin,"[18, 32]","The release of the updated version of ""Red Dawn"" was pushed back over two years thanks to MGM's financial issues. When a movie is put on the shelf for a long period of time, it usually isn't a good sign; ""The Cabin in the Woods"" is an exception. ""Skyfall"" and ""The Hobbit"" were also affected, but production was mostly just delayed rather than being a finished product collecting dust. With how excellent ""Skyfall"" turned out to be and its massive box office in-take, expectations for ""Red Dawn"" were at least to be marginally decent. Well pucker up, sweet cheeks and rub some dirt on it. ""Red Dawn"" is so bad you're going to have to lube yourself up before seeing it just to keep the crap that it spews at you from sticking to your greasy flesh.Everything initially unfolds like all of the worst parts of the ""Transformers"" movies. Did you hate seeing Sam's mom eat pot brownies in ""Revenge of the Fallen?"" Did you groan when Wheelie humped Megan Fox's leg? Your face is about to have rug burn you'll be facepalming so much. ""Red Dawn"" still manages to squeeze in all of these stupid teenage problems nobody cares about even amongst the invasion of North Korea in Spokane, Washington.Matt Eckert (Josh Peck) costs his football team the game because he's too busy trying to be a hero as the quarterback and then wonders why it eats at him after it's all over. Then afterward, they all meet at a bar while Matt's brother Jed (Chris Hemsworth) has just come home after being gone for six years in the military and reunites with Toni (Adrianne Palicki) and they reminisce about all of the making out and dating they didn't do over the years. Then after everything hits the fan, Robert (Josh Hutcherson) and Daryl (Connor Cruise) rob a Subway while making the dumbest one-liners you've ever heard. Oh, they're eating wheat bread? At least they're eating healthy during an invasion. And look, Daryl is putting a bucket under the self-service soda dispenser. Guerrilla warfare has never felt this juvenile.The entire movie is built around the Eckert family; Matt specifically. Josh Peck is one of the reasons the movie is so painful. He at least seemed more tolerable in ""The Wackness,"" but his Nickelodeon roots from his days on ""The Amanda Show"" and ""Drake and Josh"" seem to come back to haunt him now because you cannot take Matt seriously. He has that predictable back story to him; the hothead little brother overshadowed by his big brother that miraculously finds a way to overcome the odds. But Matt makes the dumbest decisions imaginable like risking the location of the only people not captured by the North Koreans just to save his girlfriend. Matt is just extremely stubborn and has that chip on his shoulder that just makes you want to slap the hell out of him.This is the acting debut of Connor Cruise, but you can't even really call it that. He has the same blank look on his face the entire movie and even the tears he sheds in the movie look like somebody threw a few drops of water on his face so he wouldn't have to show any actual emotions.In the meantime, you have to put up with this forced patriotic B.S. ""These people invaded our home and we have to FIGHT because we live here."" That's the bottom line of the speech Chris Hemsworth gives to win over the entire group. Just about every big moment can be seen coming way ahead of time. The camera work gets on your nerves, too. It's one of those movies that insist on the camera always moving and making everything really difficult for your brain to process whenever gunfire, explosions, or any sort of action takes place.Everything that is said and that occurs in ""Red Dawn"" will leave you snickering and rolling your eyes because it is so bad. The Eckert family has a pickup truck that can drive through barricades and over fire. Josh Peck seems to channel Shia LaBeouf throughout the entire movie (""Come on!"") and the ending will leave you wondering when Matt had the time to memorize or write down what he says. Josh Hutcherson drinks fresh deer blood and that is the highlight of his character. No one in the movie ever doesn't feel like filler.Without ever seeing the original film, it's difficult to say how ""Red Dawn"" compares but the 1984 film cannot be this bad. ""Red Dawn"" is like the cinematic equivalent of burping and having a little bit of barf emerge at the back of your throat. Then your esophagus burns as you swallow the disgusting liquid. That aftertaste that makes you stick out your tongue, curl your lip, and stings your nostrils, that's ""Red Dawn."" You'll want to strap yourself into one of the vehicles with a car bomb attached to it just to get out of finishing the stupid thing.",1,A sloppy combination of yelling and explosions,1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,4670,"['release', 'updated', 'version', 'Red', 'Dawn', 'was', 'pushed', 'back', 'two', 'years', 'thanks', 'MGM', 'financial', 'issues', 'When', 'movie', 'put', 'shelf', 'long', 'period', 'time', 'usually', ""n't"", 'good', 'sign', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'exception', 'Skyfall', 'Hobbit', 'were', 'also', 'affected', 'production', 'was', 'mostly', 'just', 'delayed', 'rather', 'being', 'finished', 'product', 'collecting', 'dust', 'how', 'excellent', 'Skyfall', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'massive', 'box', 'office', 'in-take', 'expectations', 'Red', 'Dawn', 'were', 'least', 'be', 'marginally', 'decent', 'Well', 'up', 'sweet', 'cheeks', 'rub', 'dirt', 'Red', 'Dawn', 'so', 'bad', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'lube', 'up', 'seeing', 'just', 'keep', 'crap', 'sticking', 'greasy', 'flesh.Everything', 'initially', 'worst', 'parts', 'Transformers', 'movies', 'Did', 'hate', 'seeing', 'Sam', 'mom', 'eat', 'pot', 'brownies', 'Revenge', 'Fallen', 'Did', 'groan', 'when', 'Wheelie', 'humped', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'leg', 'face', 'have', 'rug', 'burn', ""'ll"", 'be', 'facepalming', 'so', 'much', 'Red', 'Dawn', 'still', 'squeeze', 'stupid', 'teenage', 'problems', 'nobody', 'cares', 'even', 'amongst', 'invasion', 'North', 'Korea', 'Spokane', 'Washington.Matt', 'Eckert', 'Josh', 'Peck', 'football', 'team', 'game', 'too', 'busy', 'trying', 'be', 'hero', 'quarterback', 'then', 'wonders', 'why', 'over', 'Then', 'afterward', 'meet', 'bar', 'Matt', 'brother', 'Jed', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'just', 'come', 'home', 'being', 'gone', 'six', 'years', 'military', 'Toni', 'Adrianne', 'Palicki', 'reminisce', 'making', 'out', 'dating', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'years', 'Then', 'everything', 'fan', 'Robert', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'Daryl', 'Connor', 'Cruise', 'Subway', 'making', 'dumbest', 'one-liners', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'Oh', ""'re"", 'eating', 'wheat', 'bread', 'least', ""'re"", 'eating', 'healthy', 'invasion', 'look', 'Daryl', 'putting', 'bucket', 'self-service', 'soda', 'dispenser', 'Guerrilla', 'warfare', 'never', 'felt', 'juvenile.The', 'entire', 'movie', 'built', 'Eckert', 'family', 'Matt', 'specifically', 'Josh', 'Peck', 'one', 'reasons', 'movie', 'so', 'painful', 'least', 'seemed', 'more', 'tolerable', 'Wackness', 'Nickelodeon', 'roots', 'days', 'Amanda', 'Show', 'Drake', 'Josh', 'seem', 'come', 'back', 'haunt', 'now', 'can', 'not', 'take', 'Matt', 'seriously', 'predictable', 'back', 'story', 'hothead', 'little', 'brother', 'overshadowed', 'big', 'brother', 'miraculously', 'way', 'overcome', 'odds', 'Matt', 'dumbest', 'decisions', 'imaginable', 'risking', 'location', 'only', 'people', 'not', 'captured', 'North', 'Koreans', 'just', 'save', 'girlfriend', 'Matt', 'just', 'extremely', 'stubborn', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'just', 'want', 'slap', 'hell', 'him.This', 'acting', 'debut', 'Connor', 'Cruise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'call', 'same', 'blank', 'look', 'face', 'entire', 'movie', 'even', 'tears', 'movie', 'look', 'somebody', 'threw', 'few', 'drops', 'water', 'face', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'show', 'actual', 'emotions.In', 'meantime', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'forced', 'patriotic', 'B.S', 'people', 'invaded', 'home', 'have', 'FIGHT', 'live', 'here', 'bottom', 'line', 'speech', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'win', 'entire', 'group', 'Just', 'big', 'moment', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'coming', 'way', 'ahead', 'time', 'camera', 'work', 'nerves', 'too', 'one', 'movies', 'insist', 'camera', 'always', 'moving', 'making', 'everything', 'really', 'difficult', 'brain', 'process', 'whenever', 'gunfire', 'explosions', 'sort', 'action', 'place.Everything', 'said', 'Red', 'Dawn', 'will', 'leave', 'snickering', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'so', 'bad', 'Eckert', 'family', 'pickup', 'truck', 'can', 'drive', 'barricades', 'fire', 'Josh', 'Peck', 'channel', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'entire', 'movie', 'Come', 'ending', 'will', 'leave', 'wondering', 'when', 'Matt', 'had', 'time', 'memorize', 'write', 'down', 'what', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'fresh', 'deer', 'blood', 'highlight', 'character', 'one', 'movie', 'ever', ""n't"", 'feel', 'filler.Without', 'ever', 'seeing', 'original', 'film', 'difficult', 'say', 'how', 'Red', 'Dawn', 'compares', '1984', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'bad', 'Red', 'Dawn', 'cinematic', 'equivalent', 'burping', 'having', 'little', 'bit', 'barf', 'emerge', 'back', 'throat', 'Then', 'esophagus', 'burns', 'swallow', 'disgusting', 'liquid', 'aftertaste', 'stick', 'out', 'tongue', 'curl', 'lip', 'stings', 'nostrils', 'Red', 'Dawn', ""'ll"", 'want', 'strap', 'one', 'vehicles', 'car', 'bomb', 'attached', 'just', 'get', 'finishing', 'stupid', 'thing']",N/A

The movie did a great job relating to current events. Of course the movie is pretty fictional because by no means would any other country or military be able to invade US soil and attempt to take over as portrayed in the movie.In the movie a small group of people who called themselves ""The Wolverines"" escaped from Russian control and started wreaking havoc by blowing things up, killing Russians, and stealing their weapons and tactics. The movie was exciting, high energy, and suspenseful. I thought they could have focused a little more on the character development of some of the characters. Iam not saying that there wasn't any character development because there was, but I thought they could have elaborated and went into more detail.

This new version suffers horribly from poor casting decisions.Apparently some of these younger actors are famous among younger people, but I only recognized the guy playing Jed and the girl from Friday Night Lights. The actor playing Matty was flat out terrible. Why does he look like he's crying in almost every scene his face appears?!? There was no self sufficiency toughness to his character like in the original. The guy playing the mayor's kid looked like a little boy. I mean more similar to a middle school little boy rather than a high school young man in transition. The other friend who holds up his rifle at one point and yells Wolverines in a nod to the original was completely unbelievable. His acting was less than professional. With all of these actors coming across more as a high school theater group rather than professionals, I have to believe the directing may deserve much of the blame.The guy playing Jed managed to at least provide a semblance of a trained actor and the girl from Friday Night Lights wasn't bad, but they must have been frustrated dealing with the amateurs that make up the rest of the cast.I wanted to like this movie and really anticipated watching it once I heard they remade the original, but I can't recommend anybody waste money on this.

Case,"[0, 1]","'Red Dawn', the remake of the 1983 John Milius classic is a worthy one indeed.Hated by the critics but loved by fans for decades, the original had a story about Soviet troops invading the central US and dividing the country in two; a credible scenario offered up by former SecState Alexander Haig to director/producer John Milius and author Kevin Reynolds. The importance of the first film cannot be overstated; the mission to capture Saddam Hussein was called 'Operation Red Dawn' and carried out by Task Force 'Wolverine'.Looks like a lot of fans ended up in the US military command structure. The remake, starring Chris Hemsworth ('Thor') and an excellent cast (far better than the original, quite frankly) updates the story by replacing the Soviet invaders for those pesky North Koreans. Originally, when the film was first made (it sat on the shelf for 2 years; supposedly the studio thought it's oohrah! right wing politics not favorable to liberal left candidates and released it AFTER the 2012 election) the Red Chinese were the bad guys.They didn't like this one bit. So, the producers digitally removed all Chinese miltary insignia and flags and pasted the NK stamp on them. When released the critics mocked the the inclusion of Kim Jong Un's Stalinist nation. How could THEY threaten the US?Guess what? They did, and do now. As part of a multinational invasion force in the film, they are given the Pacific Northwest as their target of occupation, and the film starts off straight away with returning USMC veteran (Hemsworth) and his brother (Josh Peck) caught up in a parachute drop by NK troops, and head fror the hills with their boyhood buddies. For the most part, the film follows the original- including the inspired casting of Jeffery Dean Morgan in the iconic Powers Boothe role of the first film. He even is made up to look like Boothe a bit.Director Dan Bradley shoots the action very well, and there's lots of it.  At a tidy 114 minutes the film rarely takes a break, but when it does you have the excellent Adrianne Palicki to help sort out the young cast. You wish there was more of her in this.Is this a great film for the ages?

This is very much the story of two evil empires (Russia and North Korea) attempting to bring the greatest nation on Earth down, and failing because we are much more than a nation of people.  When it boils down to it, we are a nation of God fearing, freedom loving people who will fight you until one of us is dead to preserve what is right and good on this planet.

This slapdash remake, whose release was long delayed, looks like it was something for Chris Hemsworth to do when he had a couple of weeks off from making blockbusters. In this remake, the Chinese originally replaced the Russians as the villains, but the studio worried about offending a billion or so potential ticket buyers, so the film went back into the editing and special effects rooms to change the villains to North Koreans. They invade Spokane for reasons never made entirely clear. I mean, who wants Spokane? Was Seattle too hard a target? These notorious and draconian control freaks (in real life) set up what appears to be a fairly haphazard occupation, where the city streets are still full of cars and Subway is still making those awful sandwiches. Oh, some people are put into prison camps, but the teenage girl prisoners apparently still have access to hairdressers and makeup. The Wolverines move about the city with very little trouble, acquiring weapons and explosives with almost no effort. The North Korean soldiers are all the same bad shots as the enemy in Rambo movies, while our heroes - relatively untrained teenagers - are deadly accurate. The change of villains must have affected the final cut, and no doubt a lot of footage was also removed to quicken the film's still ponderous pace, so the film sort of jumps around. The Wolverines are chased from their rabbit hole by the Koreans, escape into the woods at night, but then build a campfire. Really? A Spetsnaz counter insurgency officer suddenly appears, disappears, then briefly reappears later in the film. One assumes the major portion of his performance is on the cutting room floor, unlike William Smith's portrayal of a similar character in the original, one of the highlights of the film. Also missing is the original's most powerful scene, where the group must decide whether to execute a member, their friend since childhood, who betrayed them to save his family.Milius had the good sense to stage his film in and around an isolated town in the West, which not only offered great scenery and a logical reason for the occupation (a confluence of roads), but gave the movie a real sense of his heroes' isolation and desperate situation behind enemy lines. It also made the Wolverine's hit and run raids on convoys and outposts plausible. The dense cityscape in this movie makes these Wolverine's exploits simply unbelievable and offers no iconic images.

It was definitely contrived and ridiculous, but it was exciting for teens and twenty something's. It struck a very patriotic chord with me, hoping that my generation WOULD fight back against an occupying force.The 1984 film was always a bit heavy handed and some of the acting was WAAAY over the top, but at least there was a sense of continuity and an emotional connection to the characters.That continuity and emotional connection is non-existent in the remake. I suppose today's TWITTER and texting generation cannot be bothered with subtleties such as logic and plot, but those are missing from this film.I believed Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen were brothers bound by blood and loyalty. I don't sense any connection between Chris Hemsworth and the unknown actor who plays the Charlie Sheen character. Hemsworth is a better actor than Swayze, but he has little to work with.The first half hour of the film essentially covers, in abbreviated form, over three quarters of the original film in a far more nonsensical manner. There is no build up or sense of ""one-ness"" with the characters. What's missing is a heart and soul. This film has some interesting little changes, but it essentially follows the originals plot, substituting North Korea for Russian and Cuba (from the first film).The poignancy of this is lost especially right now that North Korea is actually making threats to the U.S. and those threats seem very silly and hollow since China, Russia and our allies have all stated they're against any North Korean threat.This is a pale immitation of the original - and it was a fantastical ""what if"" film that was silly in its own way.Don't bother!",1,"Don't Bother!

I love that, like the original, it took a bunch of relatively unknown actors to make a fantastic cast.

Today they're the stars of two of the biggest releases EVER. That alone helps add to the acting pedigree of the film.I love the updated plot line. Yes, the central theme is still wonderfully in tact, but the storyline also evolved to take into account the state of affairs in the world today. A communist threat doesn't hold the same weight now that it did in the 80s.This is a great remake for fans of the original.

This time, instead of the Russians invading the United States, it's the North Koreans.Hemsworth, Peck, and Hutcherson reprise the roles made famous by Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, and C. Thomas Howell.  And instead of taking place in the slopes of the Rocky Mountains, this new movie is an urban struggle.The story is much the same: The United States is invaded by an over-zealous regime bent on capturing the United States while bestowing their political beliefs on a scared American populace.  Enter the ""Wolverines"": a group of kids forced from their homes and faced with fighting against a superior enemy in order to stay alive.As was true in the first movie, the Wolverines surprise the enemy with hit-and-run tactics, causing confusion, and killing as many of the bad guys as possible.  They are also trying to capture a sophisticated piece of electronics which could help their cause.  They are successful for a time, but the North Koreans will not go quietly.This was an ok movie, but, in my opinion, the original was better.  The acting is average at best, and many of the same lines and encounters are drawn directly from the first movie.  Even some of the dialogue is the same.I did enjoy watching this movie, but I felt that it was a let-down from the original.  Hemsworth and Peck are only average as the Eckert brothers, and Hutcherson lacks a lot of C. Thomas Howell's original aggressiveness as Robert.I can only give a luke-warm endorsement of the new Red Dawn.

Even though the original (made in the early 80's) wasn't as flashy as this remake, I think the original is better.  This movie is ok to watch but definitely not as good as the original movie.  The acting is a bit flat, with the exception of Chris Helmsworth, who does an admirable Jed Eckert but most of the rest of the acting is average at best with some cheesy lines.  The story/plot is not as good as well as this movie was held from release for a couple years and the North Koreans were changed from originally being Chinese.  It seemed that this movie was trying so much to be politically correct and trying to avoid offending the Chinese or the Russians which took away from a more believable plot.  The original movie made me care about the high school kids that were the wolverines and made me feel for the loss of the Wolverines.  This one didn't provide any character development other than a rivalry among brothers which to me detracted from the original story of the Ekerts.  With most remakes, they are hit and miss, unfortunately this movie is more miss and makes you wonder if this movie should have even been attempted.

I am not even going to compare it to the original because that would be far too painful and honestly, there isn't enough room for all of that to be written.  Let's start with the basics.  Do you feel anything for the characters.  Nope.  This is a movie about a bunch of pretty boys and girls playing what is essentially a live action video game.  They go from completely untrained civilians to hardened warriors after...wait for it.....the training montage.  I need to get one of those montages because I could sell it to the US military and make a fortune.  I mean why train a soldier for years when you can just fire up the montage when needed.  It is also very nice when the bad guys just line up in the open to be shot.  I guess they did not have a montage.  The chemistry between the characters was also exceedingly weak.  We get the forced dialogue here and there, but nothing of any value.  I saw more team building on The Expendables.  The other thing I had trouble with was how clean everybody was.  They are living in the woods, in caves, but everybody is always so well groomed.  Maybe there was a grooming montage that you can see in the Blu-Ray extras for the enhanced edition that they hopefully will never release.

1308794,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B002ZG98R8,MadMacs,"[2, 3]","Virtually the exact same problems as the recent Aussie reboot, ""Tomorrow When The War Began"".I'm convinced now that no modern western filmmaker can ""do insurgent"" any more. There's just too much disconnect between the writers and directors of today because they've never known what it's like to be subjugated, threatened and terrified. We're never going to see the kinds of films like we did after WW2, when so many creators literally lived through the various horrors of war, including being conquered by an invading enemy.Read a story once told by a comic book artist. When he was a young man and first tried his hand at illustration, all he had were comic books to teach him. It took many months of hard work, but he finally completed his first project. Impressed and praising himself for the effort and energy he had put into it, he took the art to the publishers thinking he would be hired on the spot. He wasn't.In fact, he was quickly and repeatedly dismissed. Confused, frustrated, and hurt, he finally asked one of the editors 'why' no one was interested. The editor, seeing that the young artist was suffering, took time out of his busy schedule, sat him down and explained that his work was junk. Why? Because he hadn't studied and learned from real life. A comic book is already a highly interpretive form of art, and when you copy and learn from a skewed version of reality, in turn, your version is utterly bleeped. He told him to take proper art classes, learning to draw from life and studying under qualified teachers, so that only when he was truly ready, he should try again.Readily applicable advice to filmmakers.Writers/directors need to experience the event, live the life, do the deed before putting their concepts into scripts. At the very least, do an intense exploration of the topic they're going to film. Otherwise, it's not a depiction of reality but a distorted caricature. For example: In the scene when the young would-be insurgents throw away food. Talk to survivors of invasions and they'll either laugh in your face or knock you upside your head for suggesting throwing away anything, much less food. During the Siege Of Leningrad - the populace ended up eating their cats and dogs - before turning to cannibalism. A disturbing reference made in the original 'Red Dawn' by Powers Boothe's character.Disconnected = Falsity.This reboot is reflective of so many films today: Superficial, underdeveloped and plastic. In this case, one doesn't really believe they're a bunch of kids who have suffered under the brutal thumb of oppression, much less worked their way to becoming unconventional combatants.I hesitated on this next part because I'm essentially committing plagiarism. To be fair, I'm plagiarizing myself. But I don't see the point of duplicating work already completed. So, from my review of ""Tomorrow When The War Began"" --- Why does everyone's makeup look so even throughout the movie? One of the reasons the original 'Red Dawn' worked was you could see how plain everyone was being virtually makeup free. And, most importantly, looked progressively worse as the film went on - which of course makes complete sense. I'm thinking specifically of Lea Thompson and Jennifer Grey who were almost unrecognizable by the movie's final&eacute;. That all the females had their hair and makeup intact throughout the flick doomed this to Hollywood ridiculousness.And I won't go too far beyond noting that, apparently, Chris Hemsworth is the only male Wolverine who has been through puberty and growing facial hair.The film's few positives are found when Jeffrey Dean Morgan and crew show up. But the amusing conflict of veteran combat marines being made to look silly by a bunch teenagers doesn't provide enough energy to recover from its creative death spiral.Which of the two reboots hit an uglier target? I'll go with 'Tomorrow' as a larger fail. Reboot Red Dawn works better because of Hemsworth and Morgan; and because first-time director Dan Bradley's background as a stuntman made the final action sequences engaging.Still, if you screen either production, prep yourself for dissatisfaction and disappointment.Personal Notes:- The one aspect I was looking forward to was the airborne assault. And again we see filmmakers with absolutely no experience improperly showcasing a tactic that could so easily been addressed with the assistance of a military advisor. Paratroopers without rucks, heavy equipment being dropped simultaneously with personnel, and an entire bleeping division jumping directly into a city as their drop zone. Which moron came up with that idea? If it's the listed veteran - Dotan Baer - then something got seriously lost in the translation or he flat out failed his job.- I won't rip the producers for turning the enemy into North Koreans. The Chinese literally have our fiscal sacks in their grip. And you can't tick off your bankers because they can squeeze harder than you can poke.- Connor Cruise, Tom's kid.

1308801,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B002ZG98R8,Mark Turner,"[2, 3]","It seems the Koreans have become the go to bad guys when it comes to trying to take down America. In the recent theater release OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN (a good movie by the way) they take over the White House and capture the President. And in this week's pick on DVD, RED DAWN, they actually invade the US.RED DAWN is a remake of the 1984 film that starred Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell and Charlie Sheen. This time around the story remains similar and the cast is a new group of up and coming young stars.Jed Eckert (Chris Hemsworth) is a Marine back from Afghanistan visiting his family. While his police chief dad welcomes him apparently there is some issue with his younger brother Matt (Josh Peck). The reunion is short lived as his first morning home the youngsters are awakened by a thunderous noise and then an airplane crashing into the house next door. Looking to see what is up they witness a mass invasion via parachute into their northwestern town.The two jump in Jed's truck and head out, finding their father and then separating as armed soldiers begin trying to shoot at them. As they drive off they pick up a few other teens and head for the family cabin in the woods. Listening to the news they find out that the North Koreans have invaded the U.S. and taken over many major cities on the west coast. During the night two of the kids picked up head out on their own, taking the food that was in the house. They return later with the North Korean head Capt. Cho (Will Yun Lee), the mayor (whose son is part of the group) and the boy's father. When given a chance to call them to come out, he instead tells them to kill Capt. Cho and stop anything he does. This results in his death before their eyes and a thirst for vengeance.With Jed in the lead this group of youngsters becomes an insurgent force, sabotaging various areas that are under the control of the North Koreans. Along the way they tag the places they go via spray paint with the word WOLVERINES, the name of the high school mascot. Their exploits inspire others to aid them even at the cost of death. As in the original, the team eventually comes into contact with a soldier in the U.S. Marines who lets them know what's been going on. Word of their exploits has reached them and they need their help.On one hand the whole plot of this movie might seem far fetched. But when you suspend belief as all good movies ask you to do, you find yourself rooting and cheering for these young people out to fight the good fight, taking on an enemy that wants to do nothing more but destroy America.The film holds plenty of well choreographed action scenes, plenty of gunplay and explosions and all involved present themselves incredibly well and believable in their roles. All of them come off as people you'd want in your corner if things turned bad. But there's another star of this film whose names won't appear in the credits.That star is the American people and the spirit they possess. For far too long, for me at least, viewers have had to sit through countless movies where American's are portrayed as the real bad guys, the ones who do nothing but harm people around the world, who go crazy at the slightest thing and wreak havoc on innocent people no matter where they are. They have heroes that are anti-heroes at best, men who save the day but at the cost of abusing someone, raping some woman or being the nastiest person around. This has become the norm it seems. This movie doesn't have that.Instead, the white hats and the black hats are easily identifiable here. And in today's world surprisingly enough that's a nice change. Maybe the world isn't all black and white, but when it comes to movies it's nice to feel that perhaps we aren't the terrible people that Hollywood would have us believe we are. RED DAWN is a movie that inspires while entertaining, giving you a sense of pride in this country. The same holds true of OLYMPUS. I hope these movies are successful enough to inspire more to be made but doubt it. Until then we can enjoy these movies and those made in the past.

The Marine and some of his associates escape to a cabin just outside of town(Spokane).Theyare betrayed by one of their group(they do pay him back).The battle begins. They adopt the name Wolverines after their football team. They begin stealing weapons and launch an impressive geurilla war. The North Koreans never know where the Wolverines are going to pop up. They provide plenty of strife and stress for the North Koreans(the Russians finally appear). The Wolverines manage to steal a communications used by the North Koreans.

So I rented this one to see how they would do with remaking this one...Only the theme was the same. No, only the IDEA of the same theme prevailed. This movie was much more advanced in pyrotechnics and much less 'character' intense than the old one. The action was nonstop in this one as well. The old nemesis, Russia,  was there, but the adoption of Northern Korea was really disturbing in its believability. Not so much as the mass soldier count in the movie, but the implication of true life conflict had a very real creepiness. The bond between the brothers Jed and Mannie ( not sure about the spelling there) was just as profound in this newer version, but I feel it lacked the gut wrenching sadness I felt when they died together on the bench at the end of the older movie. I'm trying to keep from doing a comparison instead of a review here, but it's hard not to. They're just very different, but then again the same. It might be just because you get really used to some things, like old songs and the remakes just don't cut it, so, honestly (sorry) I like the first version better, but this new Red Dawn is really fast paced and the younger crowd will probably disagree with me on this..once again I urge anyone whom has not seen the older version, rent them together and see what you think!

1308828,A1NIS5QFY6KCT7,B002ZG98R8,Mike the Geology Teacher,"[2, 3]","Red Dawn (2012)Red Dawn is story of a group of Spokane Washington Teenagers and a lone Iraq War veteran who fight back against an invasion of North Korean soldiers who've taken over the Pacific Northwest just as the Russians have taken over the Eastern Seaboard.The story begins as a high school football game in Spokane, where the Wolverines lead by quarterback Matt Eckert (Josh Peck) lose a final seconds loss against cross-town rivals, the Titans. Matt doesn't know it but his brother Jed (Chris Hemsworth) is back from six years in the Marine Corps...including tours in Iraq. Before Matt and Jed can resume their fraternal relationship, Spokane loses all electricity. The power outage is merely a prelude to an invasion by North Korean military forces with Russian advisors.Jed and Matt must flee into the woods, taking with them an assortment of Matt's classmates from school. When the scope of the invasion becomes clear, Jed decides to train the teenagers in military skills and tactics. They soon begin conducting guerilla assaults on the North Korean forces. During their reconnaissance of the North Koreans, they snap pictures of a secret enemy communications device. When they meet up with a team of Force Recon Marines, the professional soldiers and the teenage guerillas must find a way to steal the communications device. From that point on the action gets really intense.A few years back, I read that Hollywood was planning a Red Dawn remake and the studio execs were demanding major changes to the script. The problem was that the intended invading enemy in the story was the People's Republic of China. The Execs were worried that making such a movie would anger the Chinese government, and make it impossible to distribute American movies in China. So the enemy was changed to North Korea to appease PRC censors. But North Korea is a dysfunctional country of malnourished slaves. Seriously, NK citizens are about 6 inches shorter than their South Korean cousins because communal food production has brought the country repeatedly to starvation.So how could such a repressed, backward, dysfunctional country invade the United States? Well the opening sequence pretty well spells it out. In short, persistent recession and a weakened US military leave America vulnerable to attack. But don't worry, the American can-do spirit and the 2nd Amendment create a situation where the North Koreans find themselves with a mouthful too tough to chew.While Red Dawn is mostly shoot-em-up fun, the premise the movie is built around should give us cause for reflection. NPR has reported that North Korean and Chinese (state sponsored) hackers are continuously probing America's weaknesses. They've hacked the power grid, the Department of Defense, the stock market, and multiple Defense Contractors. China has more people studying science and engineering than we have college students. Most of our undergraduates are majoring in useful stuff like film, sociology, women's studies, and anything else that doesn't require math. So how long before America's enemies have a high-tech super-weapon that can shut down our power-grid and disable our defenses? We may find out soon enough.",4,A Rifle Behind Every Blade of Grass,1357257600,"01 4, 2013",2013,3186,"['Red', 'Dawn', '2012', 'Red', 'Dawn', 'story', 'group', 'Spokane', 'Washington', 'Teenagers', 'lone', 'Iraq', 'War', 'veteran', 'who', 'fight', 'back', 'invasion', 'North', 'Korean', 'soldiers', 'who', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'Pacific', 'Northwest', 'just', 'Russians', 'have', 'taken', 'over', 'Eastern', 'Seaboard.The', 'story', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'game', 'Spokane', 'where', 'Wolverines', 'lead', 'quarterback', 'Matt', 'Eckert', 'Josh', 'Peck', 'lose', 'final', 'seconds', 'loss', 'cross-town', 'rivals', 'Titans', 'Matt', ""n't"", 'know', 'brother', 'Jed', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'back', 'six', 'years', 'Marine', 'Corps', 'including', 'tours', 'Iraq', 'Matt', 'Jed', 'can', 'resume', 'fraternal', 'relationship', 'Spokane', 'electricity', 'power', 'outage', 'merely', 'prelude', 'invasion', 'North', 'Korean', 'military', 'forces', 'Russian', 'advisors.Jed', 'Matt', 'must', 'flee', 'woods', 'taking', 'assortment', 'Matt', 'classmates', 'school', 'When', 'scope', 'invasion', 'clear', 'Jed', 'train', 'teenagers', 'military', 'skills', 'tactics', 'soon', 'begin', 'conducting', 'guerilla', 'assaults', 'North', 'Korean', 'forces', 'reconnaissance', 'North', 'Koreans', 'snap', 'pictures', 'secret', 'enemy', 'communications', 'device', 'When', 'meet', 'up', 'team', 'Force', 'Recon', 'Marines', 'professional', 'soldiers', 'teenage', 'guerillas', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'steal', 'communications', 'device', 'point', 'action', 'really', 'intense.A', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'read', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'planning', 'Red', 'Dawn', 'remake', 'studio', 'execs', 'were', 'demanding', 'major', 'changes', 'script', 'problem', 'was', 'intended', 'invading', 'enemy', 'story', 'was', 'People', 'Republic', 'China', 'Execs', 'were', 'worried', 'making', 'such', 'movie', 'would', 'anger', 'Chinese', 'government', 'make', 'impossible', 'distribute', 'American', 'movies', 'China', 'enemy', 'was', 'changed', 'North', 'Korea', 'appease', 'PRC', 'censors', 'North', 'Korea', 'dysfunctional', 'country', 'malnourished', 'slaves', 'Seriously', 'NK', 'citizens', 'are', '6', 'inches', 'shorter', 'South', 'Korean', 'cousins', 'communal', 'food', 'production', 'brought', 'country', 'repeatedly', 'starvation.So', 'how', 'could', 'such', 'repressed', 'backward', 'dysfunctional', 'country', 'invade', 'United', 'States', 'Well', 'opening', 'sequence', 'pretty', 'well', 'out', 'short', 'persistent', 'recession', 'weakened', 'US', 'military', 'leave', 'America', 'vulnerable', 'attack', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'American', 'can-do', 'spirit', '2nd', 'Amendment', 'create', 'situation', 'where', 'North', 'Koreans', 'find', 'mouthful', 'too', 'tough', 'chew.While', 'Red', 'Dawn', 'mostly', 'shoot-em-up', 'fun', 'premise', 'movie', 'built', 'should', 'give', 'cause', 'reflection', 'NPR', 'reported', 'North', 'Korean', 'Chinese', 'state', 'sponsored', 'hackers', 'are', 'continuously', 'probing', 'America', 'weaknesses', ""'ve"", 'hacked', 'power', 'grid', 'Department', 'Defense', 'stock', 'market', 'multiple', 'Defense', 'Contractors', 'China', 'more', 'people', 'studying', 'science', 'engineering', 'have', 'college', 'students', 'Most', 'undergraduates', 'are', 'majoring', 'useful', 'stuff', 'film', 'sociology', 'women', 'studies', 'anything', 'else', ""n't"", 'require', 'math', 'how', 'long', 'America', 'enemies', 'have', 'high-tech', 'super-weapon', 'can', 'shut', 'down', 'power-grid', 'disable', 'defenses', 'may', 'find', 'out', 'soon', 'enough']",N/A

Robert: Dude we're living Call of Duty... It sucks.WOLVERINES!!!This movie has some heart but if you know anything about military tactics you'll need to suspend disbelief or you just won't enjoy the film. This will likely appeal to some youth who feel they are not doing enough with their lives and want proof that they can when older generations muck up the world.The economy has gotten worse and North Korea has allied with other Asian countries and guess what? They hate America. So they invade a good chunk of the west coast and some kids in a suburb learn guerrilla warfare (in only a few weeks or is it months?) because they're trained by a marine private (played by Chris Hemsworth . .. where are you Patrick Swayze?) and, you know, with enough montages in a film you can become a pro at anything, right?Uhm, WOLVERINES!!!See nerd kids take on veteran soldiers who cannot hit the side of a barn. See Asian soldiers fall for stupid traps. See romance and friendship blossom between kids who run around like dorks (teach some of those actors and actresses to run properly, please). See people sacrifice themselves so that the Wolverines can go on. See the Wolverines get out of a tough jam because, well, they're the heroes.Interesting propaganda about America's greed doing them in and perhaps a nod to the 99% to the 1% but they didn't explore it more which could have been the most interesting idea in this film.That said, it had some heart in certain places and if you can ignore the poor military tactics and coincidences that let the Wolverines prevail, well, you may enjoy it.Duuuuuh, WOLVERINES?Also starring Jeffrey Dean Morgan as one of the grizzled marines.Based on a 1984 film during the height of Cold War paranoia and the fearful belief that America's enemies would invade.

Chris Hemsworth relied mostly on his high stock in others movies, goofed all through this one, as if he was standing in picnic. The movie producer seemed to have forgotten the main theme of the movie, interrupted the atmosphere of a war zone with childish love affairs, social meeting, and quite and calm faces.After the artificially fake air attack and parachutes filling the skies, all appeared the work of a ninth grader high school kid, hell broke loose. Yet somehow, the escapees two brothers managed to find a quite home in the forest to spend the night while the town was invaded by North Korean army. The faces, expressions, and feelings of the characters were entirely detached from the theme of the battle zone.The most annoying aspect of the movie was the cheap shots that attempted to conceal the fake landscape. Many shots were taken too close to permit any appreciation of the real scene. Many shots were too fast to give any sense of reality.The cyclical flow of events ranging from acute and aggressive fighting into calm and quite social settings lacked any rational appearance, as the actors forgot which cycle there were in.In the hands of more experienced producer, more gifted actors, the movie could have turned legendary had the producer respected the intelligence of the viewer.When all came to an end, and the curtain about to come down, the last speaker repeated the same slogan of his brother: ""for them this land could be any place, of us it is our home"".

I sure as heck don't know.  If I used the new soundtrack it would ruin my love life.The casting was terrible as well.  Thor was ok as Jed, but the rest were awful.  Too cutsie for my taste.  The original cast had a gritty quality to them.  This group looked like a boy band mixed with a couple girls you might see on Survivor.Also, what a dumb way to kill Jed.  The guy is the main character and he just goes and gets blasted while walking down a hallway.  That's the best they could do?  Jed?  Jed?  What happened?  Is that your brains on the wall?I ask - did the characters ever look uncomfortable?  The girls maybe had their hair a little messed up, but it looked to me like the boys were freshly groomed every day.

Let's leave out how this is a bad remake for a moment:  This is just a bad movie.The characters are, for the most part, paper thin.  The only one that has a real storyline is Matty, and he's so stupid and self-centered that we were all rooting for him to die.  The bad guys, trained military professionals, are beyond inept.  The way the kids get weapons and gear and food and vehicles (basically they waltz in-and-out of the enemy-controlled city) is silly.  Characters die and we literally had no idea what their names were until their friends were shouting their names at their dead bodies.  The plot-holes are numerous and you can drive a tank right through them -- oh wait, these kids just did that.If you are a fan of the original, for the love of all that is good and holy, do not watch it.  Not only is it unrecognizable, not only did they get rid of all the tense and gritty stuff that made the first one seem possible, they actually mock one of the important character scenes from the original.  I'm not making this up -- they mock it.  Why would you want to do that?  If you have any audience that came to see this because they liked the first movie, why include something that they are sure to hate?I like remakes.  I'm not one of those people that is against the idea of a remake just because I liked the original.  But it still has to be a good movie even if they change every little thing about it.  This is not.  It's just plain bad in everything I want in a movie:  actual characters, good storyline, character growth, entertaining action scenes.

They threw in a few Russian advisors, but, still, North Korea invading the US?  Stupid is a kind appraisal.  Secondly, they switched the battle scenes from shootouts in the countryside and woods to urban fighting.  Again, where are partisan fighters(not suicide bombers) most effective?  In rough country.

1308887,A1S2M6SA4OAUNK,B002ZG98R8,Perry,"[0, 1]","Let me start by saying this review will have spoiler information regarding both versions of this movie.PLOTCommunists invade the USA and start an occupation while freedom fighters use guerrilla warfare to expel the enemies from their land.  The Plot for both movies is pretty much identical.SETTING1984 Version is set in the mid western town of Calumet Colorado.2012 Version is set in Seattle and Spokane Washington but is said to encompass Oregon and Washington States as occupied by the North Koreans.ENEMIES1984 featured Cuban and Nicaraguan aggressors attacking the USA after a communist Coup in Mexico...  Russians later joined in by attacking Alaska and pushing down through Canada.2012 features North Korea attacking two states while other agressors like Cuba and Russia attack California and the East Coast...  Again, the Russians join the assault later and provide Intel to the North Koreans.REVIEWOkay, as you probably already know this film is more like a Reboot than a Remake.First, we are supposed to suspend belief in the 1984 version and assume that a group of kids with no real military training were able to fight off the Cubans and Soviets...  In the 2012 version, the lead character was an Iraq war veteran who provided the training for the kids so that is a major improvement over the original movie.Second, we're being told that the North Koreans are a less formidable enemy than the Nicaraguans and Cubans when this simply is not true; North Korea has the worlds 4th Largest Army and they have Nukes!  Both movies had the main aggressor receiving Russian backing so neither has an advantage there.  Bottom line, North Koreans in Spokane is a hell of a lot more believable than Cubans in Colorado.Third, the first movie alludes to an eventual purge of the occupiers by Americans but, we're left with no details about how or who finished the fight.  In the new movie, they're joined by 3 Marines looking for a communications device that will be used to crack the encrypted communication of our enemies and we're given a lot more information about what is happening in other parts of the country.  We also see more and more people joining the Wolverines as the resistance grows and we have a pretty good idea who expels the enemies and how they do it.Fourth, Where are all the actors from the original movie now?  Of the two most notable, one is dead and the other killed the number 1 comedy on TV only to create a second rate version of the show later on.  Most of the other, we likely will never hear from again.  The new cast has a few that have already been in big movies and are likely to have decent careers...  It also features new actors who could have a very bright future of their own.  The bottom line is that neither movie has any oscar winners as of this time but, the odds favor the new group of at least having one.MISCONCEPTIONSThere's an assumption that the kids planned to get their food from Subway, and this simply is not true...  They ducked into the subway sandwich shop and didn't even realize they where they were but, upon realizing it they robbed the place for food.Another assumption is that their feature phone wouldn't work even though the power is out...  Again, this isn't true as the Grid is the only thing that is down, if it were an actual EMP device many of the cars would have had issues with their electrical systems as well.  What actually happened was likely a Cyber Attack on the grid as all the news articles leading up to the power outage discuss that as the #1 threat to America.CONCLUSIONThe old movie was nostalgic and a cult classic but, lets not try to paint it as the best film ever, it simply was not!  The new film is actually an upgrade in many areas and perhaps the North Koreans couldn't develop some type of Non-Nuclear EMP device or even get close to our shore line but, they are infinitely more capable of wreaking havoc than the Cubans were in 1984 (Sorry but, the Cubans couldn't blink without us knowing which eye blinked first).  This movie stands as a decent movie all around and neither the acting nor the story is as bad as many are making this out to believe.Here's a little piece of trivia for you...John Milius (who directed and co-wrote the 1984 Screenplay for Red Dawn) created a videogame called Homefront in which those invading America were the North Koreans.

My opinion lies somewhere in between.  Though I think Red Dawn was earnest enough in its attempt to entertain, when it all comes down to it, it just really doesn't work.  The opening fifteen minutes or so are very exciting and had me believing I was in for a sweet ride.  Sadly as the movie progressed it completely fell flat on its face.  I guess my biggest problems with Red Dawn are first the lack of a gradual build up.  Terrorists attack and ten minutes later a group of high schoolers are suddenly seasoned machine gun veterans.  It all seemed to happen just a little too fast.  There was no shock or confusion or even questions about what was going on.  Not very convincing under the circumstances.  Another major problem I had with the film is that it's so easy for the gang to come and go as they please in a small military occupied  town.  Seriously.  They just went where ever they wanted to go without anyone questioning a thing.  Why wouldn't other people from the town go hide out if it's that easy to escape?  Though there are moments of real entertainment in the movie in the end it's kinda boring.  I was pretty glad when the credits rolled at the hour and a half mark.  I was bored 40 minutes in and was afraid I had 80 more minutes of boredom to endure.  I don't want to hate on this movie, because like I said there were a few truly entertaining parts, but they were just too insubstantial.  I was not a big fan of the original either.  It was really sort of campy and silly and probably a much better movie when it was released (I'm going to assume that it hasn't stood the test of time).  This movie honestly tries to be entertaining, but there are just so many things that do not work.  How can a premise with so much potential be so bland?  Oh, and by the way-the shameless subway commercial made me want to throw up a little.

That is the question this movie leaves you hanging with for most of the movie, unless you catch a brief glimpse when a hint of what happened is revealed. Otherwise, Red Dawn is filled with plenty of action and fire fights with some strategy scenes scattered about the high schoolers attempts to be &#34;a flea in a big dog's coat&#34; as they suggest in the film. It doesn't try to remake the original, and goes its own way.

Another thing I want to say I am very disappointed in the makers for not adding anything to the blu ray which is why I got the dvd. In this day and age if hey want more of our money for a blu ray they need to add something more than just a digital copy. If you can get past these and some other issues you will see a pretty good moviethe action sequences are done well, there are times were the jerky camera can take away from the scene but all in all the action sequences all pretty good.Chris Helmsworth, and josh peck do grab you as brothers, and Jeffery dean Morgan is believable as a member of the free American army, and the rest while they try they really don't hold you but many of them do show potential.The story this is where the movie kinda has a little problem, there are major plot holes in the story that are never truly resolved or explained there are times where you got to kinda ask why this or that happened but these are far between, but are still there never the less and the ending while good could have been better.Special features This is where I really got disappointed I was ready to buy the blu ray but when I saw that the only extra they offered was a digital copy I got the dvd instead.

1308915,A16GM9G38VTJMV,B002ZG98R8,RedConOne,"[1, 2]","I just finished watching this film and i have to say for the most part its pretty good. There are some concerns or complaints that I'll address in a minute. This film follows a group of kids being lead by a Marine who was on leave when it all went down and their fight to regain their freedom.All this considered the acting for the most part was good, many of the actors did a outstanding job. The leader of the Wolverines is Jed, a 6 year Marine Corps combat veteran. Chris does a good job giving his lines and playing that serious battle-hardened Marine who is trying to lead a bunch of kids including his younger brother Matt (often referred to by Jed as Matty). Matt (played by Josh) is a high school kid who is a self centered ""cowboy"" who tries to be the hero and do everything himself. He resists being a warrior and taking orders from his older brother whom he feels abandoned him. His lack of discipline and self centered ways often put the Wolverines in danger. Josh does a good job at playing this self centered kid and through much of the movie i just couldn't stand the selfish behavior of his character. Many people dont realize that the relationship between Jed and Matt is a sub story involving their relationship as brothers and their past as family.What bothers me about Red Dawn 2012? Well to be honest not as much as some other viewers. Without giving up much of the story i'll say Jed is really portrayed as almost an unstoppable force barely phased by bullets hitting him. The other complaint is the vehicles used in the film by the enemy, specifically the use of the M1A1 Tank. It just wouldn't be a vehicle that would be given to the enemy portrayed.  In the story could they have stolen them? Sure i suppose but if so the context of that should've been added to the story. For the most part that is all that bothered me personally at least all that was significant enough to mention.Now to address what many have already. Is this a good remake and i say without hesitation.. YES! This is what is tough about remakes and sequels. When there is already one that sets the standard and there will always be those who dont like the new one. When you look at this movie you really shouldnt try to compare it to the first one. This should be looked at as its own movie. If you do that then your more likely to enjoy it.However i would like to note that while the ending was good if your planning a sequel. But it was in my opinion abrupt and open ended. They didnt really in my opinion do a good job finishing up the story leaving the viewer with a feeling of completion. Rather i felt like it couldn't be the end however it could be like that for 3 reasons that come to mind.1. To have a good starting point for a sequel2. To leave it open ended allowing the viewer to imagine in their mind of how they think the war would finish.3. To keep it portrayed as focused on a small group of people over a relatively short period of time. Here is an example, think if you will that you watch a documentary about D-Day and it is all that was covered in the documentary. Do you know there were other battles in WW2? Sure, but the focus was on one specific time period. The ending of this remake could've been like that to keep the focus on a small period of events.Overall this movie is good, it's action, effects, good acting, and better than average story make this film enjoyable and earn it a 4 out of 5 star rating.",4,Red Dawn Reborn,1371081600,"06 13, 2013",2013,3430,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'film', 'i', 'have', 'say', 'most', 'part', 'pretty', 'good', 'are', 'concerns', 'complaints', ""'ll"", 'address', 'minute', 'film', 'group', 'kids', 'being', 'lead', 'Marine', 'who', 'was', 'leave', 'when', 'went', 'down', 'fight', 'regain', 'freedom.All', 'considered', 'acting', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'good', 'many', 'actors', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'leader', 'Wolverines', 'Jed', '6', 'year', 'Marine', 'Corps', 'combat', 'veteran', 'Chris', 'good', 'job', 'giving', 'lines', 'playing', 'serious', 'battle-hardened', 'Marine', 'who', 'trying', 'lead', 'bunch', 'kids', 'including', 'younger', 'brother', 'Matt', 'often', 'referred', 'Jed', 'Matty', 'Matt', 'played', 'Josh', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'who', 'self', 'centered', 'cowboy', 'who', 'be', 'hero', 'do', 'everything', 'being', 'warrior', 'taking', 'orders', 'older', 'brother', 'whom', 'abandoned', 'lack', 'discipline', 'self', 'centered', 'ways', 'often', 'put', 'Wolverines', 'danger', 'Josh', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'self', 'centered', 'kid', 'much', 'movie', 'i', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'selfish', 'behavior', 'character', 'Many', 'people', 'dont', 'realize', 'relationship', 'Jed', 'Matt', 'sub', 'story', 'involving', 'relationship', 'brothers', 'past', 'family.What', 'bothers', 'Red', 'Dawn', '2012', 'Well', 'be', 'honest', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'viewers', 'giving', 'up', 'much', 'story', 'i', ""'ll"", 'say', 'Jed', 'really', 'portrayed', 'almost', 'unstoppable', 'force', 'barely', 'phased', 'bullets', 'hitting', 'other', 'complaint', 'vehicles', 'used', 'film', 'enemy', 'specifically', 'use', 'M1A1', 'Tank', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'vehicle', 'would', 'be', 'given', 'enemy', 'portrayed', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'stolen', 'Sure', 'i', 'suppose', 'so', 'context', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'added', 'story', 'most', 'part', 'bothered', 'personally', 'least', 'was', 'significant', 'enough', 'mention.Now', 'address', 'what', 'many', 'have', 'already', 'good', 'remake', 'i', 'say', 'hesitation..', 'YES', 'what', 'tough', 'remakes', 'sequels', 'When', 'already', 'one', 'standard', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'who', 'dont', 'new', 'one', 'When', 'look', 'movie', 'really', 'shouldnt', 'try', 'compare', 'first', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'looked', 'own', 'movie', 'do', 'then', 'more', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'it.However', 'i', 'would', 'like', 'note', 'ending', 'was', 'good', 'planning', 'sequel', 'was', 'opinion', 'abrupt', 'open', 'ended', 'didnt', 'really', 'opinion', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'finishing', 'up', 'story', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'completion', 'i', 'felt', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'end', 'however', 'could', 'be', '3', 'reasons', 'come', 'mind.1', 'have', 'good', 'starting', 'point', 'sequel2', 'leave', 'open', 'ended', 'allowing', 'viewer', 'imagine', 'mind', 'how', 'think', 'war', 'would', 'finish.3', 'keep', 'portrayed', 'focused', 'small', 'group', 'people', 'relatively', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'Here', 'example', 'think', 'will', 'watch', 'documentary', 'D-Day', 'was', 'covered', 'documentary', 'Do', 'know', 'were', 'other', 'battles', 'WW2', 'Sure', 'focus', 'was', 'one', 'specific', 'time', 'period', 'ending', 'remake', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'keep', 'focus', 'small', 'period', 'events.Overall', 'movie', 'good', 'action', 'effects', 'good', 'acting', 'better', 'average', 'story', 'make', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'earn', '4', '5', 'star', 'rating']",N/A

Maybe they assumed a lot of young liberals would like it? Maybe that is why they flashed Obama around in the beginning. But if you go back to the original film, most of the people watching that were of a conservative mind set. Pro gun, pro America,pro military, survival of the fittest, fight for your freedom kind of people. I think they were trying to target the wrong audience. Anyways, I am an old foegie and I was a fan of the original. I don't get too stuck on the past though. I do like to see a remake well done. Because now when I go watch the original I think the acting was just horrible and the special effects was well.... Laughable? So I like the story and could not wait to see a better more powerful acting and special effects. The movie(SPOILER ALERT) doesn't suggest if Americans win or not. The acting could of been better.

This remake of the 1980's brat pack cold war thriller gets a dust off for the modern generation, who I sincerely hope is not stupid enough to buy into this stuff. Where the 1984 had an immediacy regarding it's subject, Red Dawn now plays about as serious a video game.Red Dawn starts out pretty dreadful and uninspired and just goes down hill from there. The basic premise is still the same only our enemies have changed. Instead of the Soviets attacking middle American we get invaded by North Korea this time, originally it was to be China, but North Korea is far believable.

This version of Red Dawn is entirely wholesome and pro-American, Americans wouldn`t do that.If you don't know, this is the story of how the Spokane Wolverines high school football team and some cheerleaders fight WWIII. At least lead character Jed Eckert (Chris Hemsworth) is a marine on leave from Iraq, you know for creditability. So, Jed is able to train the high schoolers in the art of combat and military strategy in roughly ten minutes time. They make war and there acts of terrorism, I mean defiance, look easy. In the 1984 original if you will remember nearly the entire cast, name stars and all, die by the movie's conclusion. Not here, the Wolvines suffer a body count of three, if I remember correctly.Chocked full of silly chest thumping patriotism and corny heroic theme music which do much to undermine the already lousy movie. That the movie has a pro-war message that tells us that war is heroic and fun, maybe we should all join. up, is far more offensive than anything in the controversial Zero Dark Thirty. Call it G.I. Junior.Red Dawn has an endless stream of poorly filmed shaky cam action scenes. The villains are not given much personality, they exist only to be shot and killed. And there is an awful lot of shooting going on, if the illogical shoot `em up scenes which take pace in places like the heavily enemy occupied downtown Spokane, then the loud gunfire will serve  as headache inducing. .The cast is game though, young rising stars like Hemsworth, Josh Hutcherson, Josh Peck, Adrianne Palicki and Isabel Lucas all give adequate performances given this poor material and crappy script. However, Red Dawn only really perks up when Jeffrey Dean Morgan shows up late in the game, but his role too is underwritten and he has far to little screen time.Red Dawn lacks immediacy and as well as tension. Thee isn't even much false apprehension to be found. Nothing at all happens that is unexpected. The script is from the hack specialists Carl Ellsworth and Jeremy Passmore, it is predictable even to those who are not familiar with the original.What stuntman turned first time director Dan Bradley has done to Red Dawn is reduce it to a violent Noxima Commercial. Where the original was from visionary filmmaker John Milius, co-author of the seminal Apocalypse Now. This new version is clearly from a guy who doesn't know his arse from a movie camera, he lacks any sort of style and his film lacks any and all substance or character depth. The Red Dawn redux is 93 minutes of pain and misery felt by a paying audience who will now know what it is like to be ripped off, it is overlong by about ninety minutes.It should be noted that Red Dawn is not a new movie. In fact it was made in 2009, that means it was Hemsworth's first starring role even before Thor, it's been collecting dust all this time and should still be doing so. And you know what, it is astounding how dated a movie can look after only three years. I bet it wont take another three years to forget that this movie was even ever made.read my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",1,Don't retread on me,1360627200,"02 12, 2013",2013,4313,"['remake', 'Red', 'Dawn', 'was', 'so', 'stupid', 'be', 'annoying', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'people', 'are', 'actually', 'giving', 'thing', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'saying', 'great', 'know', 'same', 'category', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'wrong', 'could', 'being', 'something', 'drugs', 'absolutely', 'have', 'see', 'Red', 'Dawn', 'seeRed', 'Dawn', 'much', 'prepositions', 'then', 'Red', 'Dawn', 'remake', '1980', 'brat', 'pack', 'cold', 'war', 'thriller', 'dust', 'modern', 'generation', 'who', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'not', 'stupid', 'enough', 'buy', 'stuff', 'Where', '1984', 'had', 'immediacy', 'regarding', 'subject', 'Red', 'Dawn', 'now', 'as', 'serious', 'video', 'game.Red', 'Dawn', 'out', 'pretty', 'dreadful', 'uninspired', 'just', 'down', 'hill', 'there', 'basic', 'premise', 'still', 'same', 'only', 'enemies', 'have', 'changed', 'Instead', 'Soviets', 'attacking', 'middle', 'American', 'get', 'invaded', 'North', 'Korea', 'time', 'originally', 'was', 'be', 'China', 'North', 'Korea', 'far', 'believable', 'Yeah', 'right.Pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'same', 'characters', 'are', 'identical', 'before', 'least', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'reduced', 'non', 'speaking', 'roles', 'are', 'small', 'tweaks', 'script', 'sure', 'mean', 'traitor', 'mitts', 'version', 'Red', 'Dawn', 'entirely', 'wholesome', 'pro-American', 'Americans', 'wouldn', 't', 'do', 'that.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'story', 'how', 'Spokane', 'Wolverines', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'team', 'cheerleaders', 'fight', 'WWIII', 'least', 'lead', 'character', 'Jed', 'Eckert', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'marine', 'leave', 'Iraq', 'know', 'creditability', 'So', 'Jed', 'able', 'train', 'high', 'schoolers', 'art', 'combat', 'military', 'strategy', 'roughly', 'ten', 'minutes', 'time', 'make', 'war', 'acts', 'terrorism', 'mean', 'defiance', 'look', 'easy', '1984', 'original', 'will', 'remember', 'nearly', 'entire', 'cast', 'name', 'stars', 'die', 'movie', 'conclusion', 'Not', 'here', 'Wolvines', 'suffer', 'body', 'count', 'three', 'remember', 'correctly.Chocked', 'full', 'silly', 'chest', 'thumping', 'patriotism', 'corny', 'heroic', 'theme', 'music', 'do', 'much', 'undermine', 'already', 'lousy', 'movie', 'movie', 'pro-war', 'message', 'war', 'heroic', 'fun', 'maybe', 'should', 'join', 'up', 'far', 'more', 'offensive', 'anything', 'controversial', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'Call', 'G.I', 'Junior.Red', 'Dawn', 'endless', 'stream', 'poorly', 'filmed', 'shaky', 'cam', 'action', 'scenes', 'villains', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'much', 'personality', 'exist', 'only', 'be', 'shot', 'killed', 'awful', 'lot', 'shooting', 'going', 'illogical', 'shoot', 'em', 'up', 'scenes', 'take', 'pace', 'places', 'heavily', 'enemy', 'occupied', 'downtown', 'Spokane', 'then', 'loud', 'gunfire', 'will', 'serve', 'headache', 'inducing', '.The', 'cast', 'game', 'young', 'rising', 'stars', 'Hemsworth', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'Josh', 'Peck', 'Adrianne', 'Palicki', 'Isabel', 'Lucas', 'give', 'adequate', 'performances', 'given', 'poor', 'material', 'crappy', 'script', 'However', 'Red', 'Dawn', 'only', 'really', 'up', 'when', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'up', 'late', 'game', 'role', 'too', 'underwritten', 'far', 'little', 'screen', 'time.Red', 'Dawn', 'immediacy', 'as', 'well', 'tension', 'Thee', ""n't"", 'even', 'much', 'false', 'apprehension', 'be', 'found', 'Nothing', 'happens', 'unexpected', 'script', 'hack', 'specialists', 'Carl', 'Ellsworth', 'Jeremy', 'Passmore', 'predictable', 'even', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'original.What', 'stuntman', 'turned', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'Dan', 'Bradley', 'done', 'Red', 'Dawn', 'reduce', 'violent', 'Noxima', 'Commercial', 'Where', 'original', 'was', 'visionary', 'filmmaker', 'John', 'Milius', 'co-author', 'seminal', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'new', 'version', 'clearly', 'guy', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'arse', 'movie', 'camera', 'sort', 'style', 'film', 'substance', 'character', 'depth', 'Red', 'Dawn', 'redux', '93', 'minutes', 'pain', 'misery', 'felt', 'paying', 'audience', 'who', 'will', 'now', 'know', 'what', 'be', 'ripped', 'off', 'overlong', 'ninety', 'minutes.It', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'Red', 'Dawn', 'not', 'new', 'movie', 'fact', 'was', 'made', '2009', 'was', 'Hemsworth', 'first', 'starring', 'role', 'even', 'Thor', 'been', 'collecting', 'dust', 'time', 'should', 'still', 'be', 'doing', 'so', 'know', 'what', 'astounding', 'how', 'dated', 'movie', 'can', 'look', 'only', 'three', 'years', 'bet', 'wont', 'take', 'three', 'years', 'forget', 'movie', 'was', 'even', 'ever', 'made.read', 'reviews', 'moviezonemagazine.com']",N/A
1308986,A246YIFE5M6M2C,B002ZG98R8,"Shawn Kovacich ""Shawn Kovacich""","[58, 76]","Well I just got back from the Midnight movie of this film which is a remake of the 1984 original movie,Red Dawn, which had an all star cast consisting of; Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell, Lea Thompson, Charlie Sheen, Jennifer Grey, Ben Johnson, Harry Dean Stanton, Ron O'Neal, and Powers Boothe. The setting for the 1984 film was a small town in Colorado when suddenly during a normal fall school day, Soviet, Nicaraguan, and Cuban troops parachute out of the sky and begin landing on the football field and throughout the small Colorado town. A few of the teenagers led by Patrick Swayze's character Jed, flee into the mountains and left to fend for themselves while the remaining towns people that were captured are forced to live at the whim of the invading forces. After a few short weeks of living in the mountains the teens are forced to make a decision on whether or not to fight or submit to the rule of the occupying forces. They decide and begin to wage their own guerrilla warfare against the invading Soviet troops.Now I went into this movie being a very big fan of the original and had just recently re-watched it again, for perhaps the 30th or 40th time, in anticipation of this remake. So I would have to advise you, as you are reading this review, that perhaps I am a bit jaded and prone to favoring the original version of this film. Now having said that, I did like this film and I feel that it does the original version some justice, although this film just didn't seem to have the heart that the original film had. I really can't say that it was the fault of the actors as the vast majority of them did a fine job with their roles, but the depth of each character wasn't really explored as it had been in the original film.Now we have to discuss believability when it comes to the actual premise of the United States being invaded by a foreign power. Ridiculous? Perhaps. But I would strongly lean to the possibility that it could very well happen, although maybe not exactly like it is depicted in the movie, but I do believe it could. Could a small band of teenagers and young adults become an impressive and effective guerrilla force? Certainly. But my problem is why was their only a handful in a town as big as Spokane, Washington, which at last time I heard was hovering around just under 500,000 people. You mean to tell me that there are only a dozen or so people out of that many that have the guts to stand up and fight? I don't think so. Maybe in some sections of the country where everyone is a brain-dead zombie (for whatever reason), but I think there would be a lot more taking up arms.Now there are a lot of similarities between the current film and the 1984 original, but there is also enough differences to make this movie stand on its own.Here are ten of the major differences without really giving away in spoilers.1. The setting for this film is Spokane, Washington as opposed to a small Colorado town as depicted in the original.2. The title character of Jed Eckert (Chris Hemsworth) is a U.S Marine on leave from Iraq in this film as opposed to Swayze's character who was not in the military.3. Jed and Matt's (Josh Peck) father does not end up being taken to an ""internment camp"" as was shown in the original film.4. This film has a lot more urban guerrilla fighting in it compared to the original.5. The very controversial moment in the original film is in this film as well, but in a totally different way.6. Although it was primarily the Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Russians in the original film, the main villains in this film are the North Koreans and a very small moment and really merely a brief mention of Russian involvement. It should be noted that originally the invading forces were supposed to be Chinese, which is much more likely, but so as not to ""offend"" anyone, the producers of the film decide to go with the North Koreans. Hmmmm?7. In my opinion more apparent in this film compared to the original is the fact that there will be a lot of family, friends, and neighbors that will not only willingly submit to the rule of an invading army, but a lot will also become collaborators against their own countrymen. Watch for this part of the movie and feel free to cheer along with me when a collaborator gets what he so richly deserves.8. The somewhat similar role that Powers Boothe played in the original film is basically revised by Jeffrey Dean Morgan in this film, but with a quite of bit of a difference.9. The deer hunting scene has also been included in this film. However, they have added a very humorous twist to it that will have you rolling in the aisles laughing.10. The ending is a complete 180 degree flip-flop from the original film.Now there are some other major differences in this film as compared to the original, but I don't want to post any real spoilers so you will just have to go see the movie and see fi you can spot all the differences and similarities yourself.Shawn KovacichAuthor and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.",4,"Not Bad, But Just Doesn't

The same North Koreans who couldn't conquer South Korea and it was a small country right next door to them? These guys couldn't find their own butt with both hands and a map, but have been able to conquer a nation with a huge land mass and a modern military, with allies that would actually fight for us. So the scenario has gone from very improbable, to seriously? The same guys who shot missiles in spirals? We could conquer N. Korea after breakfast and be home for lunch.At this point I had to remove my brain from my head to watch the film.This film was updated to reflect the changes in the audience which demands more action and special effects at the cost of silly things like creating characters or drama.Armed with some C-4 that happened to be lying around, Jed (Chris Hemsworth) leads a group of teens against the Red Army because somehow our entire arm forces stationed in over 100 nations and all the ships at sea are too busy fighting some electronic jamming EMF thing. In one scene Robert (Josh Hutcherson) risks everyone's life to rescue the pretty blond Erica (Isabel Lucas) and still can't score.With an inane script, you need good actors who can bring it to life. This one didn't have it. In fact it bordered on campy considering it was NORTH KOREA! The film ended rather abruptly after a brief ""patriotic"" message...""This is our home.""

To me that's more realistic than the origional. I know they constantly talk about North Korea but we all know who they are omitting between Russian and the Koreans when it comes to invading the U.S. It will be a joint effort because every one likes to be on the &#34;winning&#34; side, military folks included, and that's why there are three countries invading the U.S. not just the Russians.p.s. spoiler, kinda.

1309064,A6AT9WIGOXKRP,B002ZG98R8,"Whipple McTeelson the Third ""Purveryor of Mad...","[0, 0]","When I walked out of the movie theater back in 1983 having watched Red Dawn a lot of things were going through my mind.  I wanted to kill them dirty commies.  I also was rather thrilled that I'd seen the first ever PG-13.  I was wondering whether I should go see Sheena - the lordess of the Jungle when that was due in a week.  But I didn't think that they'd remake this movie.  Oh, the simple mindedness of a teenager growing up in the 80s.Maybe I'm not the best person to review this Red Dawn.  I think only teenagers should.  I loved the first one.  Again, I'd go up in the woods and take on them rat commies in a heart beat if they had infiltrated my beloved hometown of New Belfast, RI.  And my tolerance for camping quickly erodes after two nights.So if there are any teens out there that are all fired up to put some North Korean commies in their sights after watching this movie then the propaganda work of the Red Dawn legacy lives on.  Granted, I never did join the army and go off to war.  My belly just isn't made for a good fight.  But much like the original Rambo it sure put a thrill in my head.Unlike that Karate Kid remake or the impending RoboCop I rather liked this one.  Low expectations are a gift when watching low standing movies.  They got the blue print from the first flick; tweaked a few things.  moved the story from a small town to Spokane so that was interesting.  Personally I woulda loved seeing Charlie Sheen as the older Marine but Jeffery Dean Morgan is a blast-he's good too kick up a stir in any movie he's been in so far.Still I miss having the kids witnessing the attack from their classroom and refilling the radiator before racing off into the woods.  The first had a terrific all-star cast.  This one does too-hoping some of these kids don't get overlooked in other movies.  But I dunno about the North Koreans.  They didn't raise my hackles so to speak like them Cubans and Ruskies did.  I could see the commies having that foothold in South America with the Sandinistans et al allowing the Soviets to have a foothold to launch the attack.  We'd see the North Koreans coming a million miles away and they'd get half way here and wind up sunk with their antiquated ships.

The action is suppose to be gritty and ugly, and instead this version has the kids doing parkour, what!? The brothers Jed and Matty story is just the old ""You werent around"" storyline. So they are bickering like an old married couple the entire time. Matty for some reason wants to risk everything for his high school chick that the movie spends 27 seconds on building their relationship. So you basically just roll your eyes every time he wants to free her and risk his groups life. Most, if not all the action takes place in the town, rather then on the outskirts in the wilderness like the original. The problem with that? I think the badguys would eventually get around to preventing outsiders from entering, or having people walk around freely. The orignal they walked around for supplies and news every now and again, but didn't cause much trouble in town. Speaking of badguys, it was suppose to be the Chinese invading, but since Paramount wanted to sell their movie to China, they had it quickly changed to the North Koreans, which makes no sense because they have a hard time even feeding themselves over there.Timeline is another problem. The first one showed you every month and it gave you a perspective of how long these kids have been at war. The new version does no such thing. We get a training montage for a few minutes, then its attack attack attack. No slow falls, but people are wearing thick jackets, and its football season (since the opening is a football game). So is this movie just taking place in like September-October? Maybe they are in the one mountainous area of Spokane, WA where it does not snow? I dunno. But without snow, and during football season, the moving is basically saying its only taking place for like two month timeline. Not enough for training, and all those attacks. And then the movie is only 92 minutes, which leads me to believe a bunch was cut from the movie. Its hard to build characters and a good story in 92 minutes. And the worse part ever, the movie just plain wussed out when it came to the Daryl and the tracking device side-story.

Terrible acting (I'm looking at you Josh Peck), no character development what so ever, bad pacing, tons of plot holes, and very poorly film with way too much shaky cam. I can suspend disbelief in films, but when a film ask me to suspend my disbelief even further after already accepting the incredibly implausible and dumb plot by doing more things that simply just don't make sense, it seems that the writers just believe that the audience is stupid and won't question anything and that pisses me off. I could've rolled with it if it was being played as an over-the-top silly B-Movie, but it's being played off as a dead serious war film that feels more like watching watching two rival gangs fight than the two opposing forces that are presented to us. The only positive thing I can say about it is that Chris Hemsworth was at least trying with what he had to work with and the film never slowed down despite the poorly pacing. The only way I could ever recommend someone to watch this is if they want to watch a film that's laughably bad. Another positive I can say about it is that for the first hour, me and my buddies were laughing non-stop at how terrible the film was, but after about an hour, there really is no more material to make fun off anymore and it becomes a pain to sit through the last 30 minutes that lead up to the incredibly bad ending that tryings to be an emotional cheap-shot to get the audience to feel sad despite the fact that we don't feel anything for these characters since they are all undeveloped and mostly unlikeable.

1309077,A12LKEM543ILBK,B002ZG98R8,zombie phreak,"[0, 0]","First of all let's get this out of the way right now.  Yes I saw the original back in the 80's and I loved it.  Okay now that we got that out of the way, let's move on.The action was incredible!  The gunfights were great and the running battles rocked so hard!  The costumes of the North Korean invaders were very realistic as well!  I actually thought I was looking at real life North Korean soldiers!Plus when Josh Hutcherson's character raised his assault rifle to the heavens and yelled the classic line of ""WOLVERINES!!!""  I had the same chills run through my body that I had back in the 80's when C. Thomas Howell did it.***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***There are some parts in the movie that just didn't make any sense to me.  Like when the father/sheriff is on the bullhorn telling his sons to go to war and the Korean officer is about to shoot him.  Right then Chris Hemsworth's character had a hunting rifle with him and it was pointed at the officer, plus it had a scope on it.  So why didn't he just shoot the guy before his father was shot?  I mean, that's what I'd do if I was in that situation and someone was about to shoot my dad.Plus later one when the Wolverines and their new allies infiltrate the police station which was turned into the Korean HQ, they run into some soldiers there and are spotted.  One of the Korean soldiers is a woman and she shrieks like a little girl upon seeing enemy soldiers.  Why did she do that instead of drawing her sidearm and shooting the intruders?  Seriously!  You're a soldier and you've been trained pretty much since you could hold a gun on how to be a soldier for the North Korean dictatorship.  And your reaction to seeing the enemy is to scream at the top of your lungs like a little girl who just saw a mouse?  How the hell did she make it through basic training if this is how to she responds to a combat situation?  You'd think this would have been addressed before she was dropped into an active warzone.Another thing I didn't understand.  What was the point of bringing in the Russian commando and pointing him out to the audience?  Seriously, the only thing he does is tackle one of the Wolverines and inject him with a tracking device so they can find the Wolverines.  ANYONE could have done that!  Why did they need to spend time and money to bring this guy in from Russia?  The North Koreans don't have anyone in their military that can push the plunger down on a syringe?  They have to outsource that to a Russian guy?Something else that bugged me, why didn't we see the fate of the mayor's son when they abandon him because he's got the tracking device in him?  They just give him some gear, a machine gun and we never see him again.  It would be nice to see his last stand.Once Chris Hemsworth's character dies the movie just takes a dive.  His brother is left to lead the Wolverines and he just can't pull it off like his brother did.  He tries to give a rousing speech to inspire others to join the Wolverines to fight the North Koreans but he just fails miserably.  It's like he was mumbling his way through this speech.  I doubt this guy could lead a troop of girl scouts let alone a group of freedom fighters!The ending is a disappointment as well.  We are shown an overhead shot of the high school football field that was turned into a prison camp.  The American prisoners are rattling their cells, shouting ""Wolverines!"" over and over.  We're given shots of the North Korean guards who are nervously watching the prisoners, their weapons being held tightly and we can see they are scared.  Then in the distance we see a group of vehicles racing toward the prison, guns blazing, RPG's are being fired and the guard towers are destroyed in fiery explosions!  The American prisoners, still shouting ""WOLVERINES!""  Are charging toward the gate, one of them finds an American flag and begins waving it furiously, the audience is on the edge of their seats in anticipation of what will happen next!  And we roll the credits.  REALLY!?!  You pulled a Sopranos on us!?!  We don't even get to see what happens?  Were the prisoners liberated?  Did the North Koreans gun them down?  Was it a trap set by the North Koreans?  Did the escaping prisoners join the Wolverines and help re-take the city?  We don't know, it's left up to our imagination.  THAT SUCKED!!!***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***There are a few homages to the original film, such as the battle cry of ""WOLVERINES!!!""  As they stop the execution of the townspeople.  The phrase, ""The chair is against the wall"" over the radio.  Plus a few others as well.The movie had it's flaws, but it was also very good.  I loved Chris Hemsworth in this and his character basically carried the whole movie.  It reminded me of the original film and it brought that film to the current era with changing the villains from the Russians to the North Koreans.  It also gave me the same thrill that the original did and it made me proud to be an American.Wolverines forever!",3,Wolverines Forever!,1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,5026,"['First', 'let', 'get',
