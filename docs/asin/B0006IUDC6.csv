869514,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B0006IUDC6,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[52, 55]","Though ""Love's Enduring Promise"" doesn't measure up to its predecessor, ""Love Comes Softy,"" it is nevertheless lovely to follow up on Clark Davis and his family, who share their joys and sorrows, and their faith, strength, and commitment with one another. Missie is now a young lady, with serious choices to make. She is a schoolteacher, and is being pursued by a wealthy surveyor, but when Clark suffers an accident and can no longer work the farm, a young man comes to their aid, and the viewer knows long before Missie does, that he is a better match for her.The dialog and scene progression don't flow as well in this 2nd film, but I wouldn't mind seeing a 3rd and even 4th installment, as it is refreshing to see this type of family entertainment, where people speak without cursing, and keep their clothes on. It would make an excellent TV series, as it is full of wonderful characters, and themes of hope and redemption. Directed by Michael Landon Jr. for Hallmark, it is a little like his father's wildly successful ""Little House on the Prairie."" Based on a novel by Janette Oke, the 19th century plot is filmed in beautiful California locations, like Sable Ranch in Canyon County, with cinematography by Maximo Munzi.The cast: January Jones is good as Missie, with Mackenzie Astin as Grant, her rich suitor, and Logan Bartholomew, who is an exceptionally handsome and capable actor. as Nate. Katherine Haigl repeats her role as Marty, and as Clark, Dale Midkiff once again is superb. Cliff De Young plays Zeke, an embittered man with many scars that need healing.

869518,ASV9DYAW4ZM89,B0006IUDC6,"Brother Shane ""Brother Shane""","[5, 10]","Am not sure if this is how Janet Oke wrote the story or not, because i haven't read the book...but i was expecting it to be moslty about the two main characters (Marty & Clark), from the first film. It is not.It was somewhat dissapointing. Not that i didn't enjoy it, and not that it wasn't a good story, it was, but overall, it could have been much better. For one, it's obvious the director, Michael Landon, jr., showed us he is a good Catholic and never wants to offend any other religions...keeping the name of Jesus Christ (or even just, 'Jesus'), out of the entire dialogue. To say that a devoutly Christian man, living circa 1880, never used the name of his Lord and Savior, even during prayers, is ludicrous. Not only would they have ended every prayer in the name of Jesus, His name was a common part of every day language of the period. I've noticed that most films produced by Jews rarely use the name of our Lord, unless in the abstract, or unless said by a church authority figure, such as a priest of professor. As if the common believer was not educated enough to properly express His name. That flaw was inexcusable.There are other flaws too, although not as appalling...none-the-less they take away from the power of the story (as i do feel the author, Janet Oke, intended it to be inspiring!?), and degrade it to 'B'-class status.Too bad. The acting, costumes, locations, sound quality, etc. were all superb...what a waste.One flaw i noticed might have been intentional, when Missie (now a young woman), was riding her horse, she was not riding side-saddle...and she was wearing a dress. I know she grew up kind of a tom-boy, but a Christian lady of that time period, wearing a dress, i seriously doubt would've rode like a man, tom-boy or no. Since i haven't read the book, then i can't say if that was intended or not. Not to be too critical, but that seemed to be an inaccurate portrayal of a Christian lady, circa 1880.The other flaw was not as obvious. If you noticed, when Missie had to plow the fields, they first showed her wearing a dress. Then they show a scene of her wearing trousers. The final scene she is again wearing a dress. Now i don't know about you but as far as i know, Christian ladies back then did not wear men's trousers, period. The only pants they wore were their bloomers, and that was under their petticoat. Women were extremely modest in those days...especially when outdoors. We're not talkin about Annie Oakly here...we're talking about the daughter of a very devout Christian man. Again, i don't know if this was part of the original story, but i do know it was not historically accurate. Either that or the director just couldn't make up his mind, or the editors just botched the scenes.Other than that, the only other thing i didn't like, was the fact that the story centered around other than the two original characters. My question is, why? We barely got to experince life with Marty and Clark, and now they have two young boys, and Missie is all grown up. Excuse me, but this is not how you make a series of films on this type of story. We need to get to know the characters better. Yes, i cried in both films, but hey, I'm a big cry-baby anyways . But they could have done a much better job. Overall though, it is a good family film, and certainly better than all the immoral sex, violence and drug crap put out by Hollywood every day. So i do commend them on that. But if you watch the film, Time Changer, then you'll know why i had a major complaint about this poor effort.*** 3 Stars.",3,Somewhat dissapointing...,1131235200,"11 6, 2005",2005,3546,"['Am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'Janet', 'Oke', 'wrote', 'story', 'not', 'i', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'i', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'moslty', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Marty', 'Clark', 'first', 'film', 'not.It', 'was', 'somewhat', 'dissapointing', 'Not', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'not', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'story', 'was', 'overall', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'one', 'obvious', 'director', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'jr.', 'showed', 'good', 'Catholic', 'never', 'offend', 'other', 'religions', 'keeping', 'name', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'even', 'just', ""'Jesus"", 'entire', 'dialogue', 'say', 'devoutly', 'Christian', 'man', 'living', 'circa', '1880', 'never', 'used', 'name', 'Lord', 'Savior', 'even', 'prayers', 'ludicrous', 'Not', 'only', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'prayer', 'name', 'Jesus', 'name', 'was', 'common', 'part', 'day', 'language', 'period', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'most', 'films', 'produced', 'Jews', 'rarely', 'use', 'name', 'Lord', 'abstract', 'said', 'church', 'authority', 'figure', 'such', 'priest', 'professor', 'common', 'believer', 'was', 'not', 'educated', 'enough', 'properly', 'express', 'name', 'flaw', 'was', 'inexcusable.There', 'are', 'other', 'flaws', 'too', 'not', 'appalling', 'none-the-less', 'take', 'away', 'power', 'story', 'i', 'do', 'feel', 'author', 'Janet', 'Oke', 'intended', 'be', 'inspiring', 'degrade', ""B'-class"", 'status.Too', 'bad', 'acting', 'costumes', 'locations', 'sound', 'quality', 'etc', 'were', 'superb', 'what', 'waste.One', 'flaw', 'i', 'noticed', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'intentional', 'when', 'Missie', 'now', 'young', 'woman', 'was', 'riding', 'horse', 'was', 'not', 'riding', 'side-saddle', 'was', 'wearing', 'dress', 'know', 'grew', 'up', 'kind', 'tom-boy', 'Christian', 'lady', 'time', 'period', 'wearing', 'dress', 'i', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'would', ""'ve"", 'rode', 'man', 'tom-boy', 'i', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'then', 'i', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'intended', 'not', 'Not', 'be', 'too', 'critical', 'seemed', 'be', 'inaccurate', 'portrayal', 'Christian', 'lady', 'circa', '1880.The', 'other', 'flaw', 'was', 'not', 'obvious', 'noticed', 'when', 'Missie', 'had', 'plow', 'fields', 'first', 'showed', 'wearing', 'dress', 'Then', 'show', 'scene', 'wearing', 'trousers', 'final', 'scene', 'again', 'wearing', 'dress', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'as', 'far', 'i', 'know', 'Christian', 'ladies', 'back', 'then', 'did', 'not', 'wear', 'men', 'trousers', 'period', 'only', 'pants', 'wore', 'were', 'bloomers', 'was', 'petticoat', 'Women', 'were', 'extremely', 'modest', 'days', 'especially', 'when', 'outdoors', ""'re"", 'not', 'talkin', 'Annie', 'Oakly', 'here', ""'re"", 'talking', 'daughter', 'very', 'devout', 'Christian', 'man', 'Again', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'part', 'original', 'story', 'i', 'do', 'know', 'was', 'not', 'historically', 'accurate', 'director', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'editors', 'just', 'botched', 'scenes.Other', 'only', 'other', 'thing', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'fact', 'story', 'centered', 'other', 'two', 'original', 'characters', 'question', 'why', 'barely', 'got', 'experince', 'life', 'Marty', 'Clark', 'now', 'have', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'Missie', 'grown', 'up', 'not', 'how', 'make', 'series', 'films', 'type', 'story', 'need', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'better', 'Yes', 'i', 'cried', 'films', 'hey', ""'m"", 'big', 'cry-baby', 'anyways', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'Overall', 'good', 'family', 'film', 'certainly', 'better', 'immoral', 'sex', 'violence', 'drug', 'crap', 'put', 'out', 'Hollywood', 'day', 'So', 'i', 'do', 'commend', 'watch', 'film', 'Time', 'Changer', 'then', ""'ll"", 'know', 'why', 'i', 'had', 'major', 'complaint', 'poor', 'effort', '3', 'Stars']",N/A

The film revolves primarily around Missy, with Marty & Clark popping up occasionally, and Willie is mostly a stranger.It DOES still maintain Christian values and morals, and faith in God is still prominently displayed in prayer and Scripture reading. And though it strays from the book, the storyline does stand on its own, so I will keep it in mind for family viewing as my kids get a little older!",3,Straying further from the books...,1303084800,"04 18, 2011",2011,795,"['really', 'really', 'WANTED', 'like', 'thought', 'first', 'Love', 'Comes', 'Softly', 'film', 'was', 'fairly', 'good', 'attempt', 'sticking', 'Janette', 'Oke', 'original', 'story', 'had', 'hopes', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'bad', 'as', 'far', 'changes', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'wrong', 'Willie', 'film', 'been', 'gone', 'years', 'due', 'tragedy', 'family', 'When', 'Nate', 'nobody', 'film', 'primarily', 'Missy', 'Marty', 'Clark', 'popping', 'up', 'occasionally', 'Willie', 'mostly', 'stranger.It', 'DOES', 'still', 'maintain', 'Christian', 'values', 'morals', 'faith', 'God', 'still', 'prominently', 'displayed', 'prayer', 'Scripture', 'reading', 'book', 'storyline', 'stand', 'own', 'will', 'keep', 'mind', 'family', 'viewing', 'kids', 'get', 'little', 'older']",N/A

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Back when I lost my man card and started routinely tuning in to Hallmark Channel programming,Love Comes Softlysurprised me with its ability to keep me planted on the couch, eyeballs peeled to the screen. LOVE'S ENDURING PROMISE sequels up LOVE COMES SOFTLY, with Katherine Heigl and Dale Midkiff reprising their roles. Only, this follow-up doesn't gravitate around them. Instead, their characters - Clark and Marty Davis - take a back seat to their daughter, Missie Davis, who this time is played by January Jones.It's about ten years since the events in LOVE COMES SOFTLY. Missie is now an 18-year-old schoolteacher (if my math hasn't failed me). She now has two younger brothers, both of whom are in her class. Missie is now around that age when she's ready for big things to happen in her life. Appropriately, the story's central conflict revolves around Missy's being courted by two suitors, one a polished scion of a railroad empire (Mackenzie Astin), the other a mysterious young drifter (Logan Bartholomew) who helps out with the farm when Clark Davis suffers a grave injury while chopping wood. A sub-plot surfaces concerning the Davis family's attempts to help the drifter reconcile with his troubled past.To quote my neighborhood's pastor, who's got a wicked sense of humor: ""I'm not a very religious man."" Gratifyingly, Clark Davis, in his conversations with the young man Willie, doesn't come across as pushy preachy. His words seem a comfort to me. On Willie, those words must settle on him like cool balm to an anguished soul. He pays heed to Clark's talk of God's enduring promise, that ""one day, He will wipe away every tear and there will be no more pain, hardship, or suffering."". Midkiff continues to portray Clark Davis as a man of integrity and deep compassion and unflinching faith. Honestly, this may be his best role.Whenever I watch these Janette Oke screen adaptations, I hearken back to Laura Ingalls' Little House on the Prairie books which I ate up when I was a kid. Oke's long-running series, as translated to your living room screen, are these prairie romances that promote strong family values and deliver a timeless message. I love the historical angle, love that these stories take place in early American West and that we're made privy to how harsh everyday life was for the pioneers.The actors keep it low-key and believable. Their restraint grounds the narrative, and there's a sense that real life is unfolding right there before our eyes. January Jones keeps your eyes firmly focused on her, although I do admit that Skye McCole Bartusiak, who was around 11-years-old when she played Missie so brilliantly in LOVE COMES SOFTLY, trumps her performance-wise. LOVE'S ENDURING PROMISE, like the other movies in this series, goes for the aesthetics of the quiet, heartfelt drama. In a world rife with rampant cynicism and messed-up reality shows and other televised grotesqueries, I find the film's gentle simplicity - its lack of artifice - refreshing and so very appealing. Ain't that so, Honey Boo Boo?For those with a yen for more of Missie Davis' frontier adventures, check outLove's Long Journey, next in the series.",4,Laura Ingalls approves,1375833600,"08 7, 2013",2013,3156,"['Back', 'when', 'lost', 'man', 'card', 'started', 'routinely', 'tuning', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'programming', 'Love', 'Comes', 'Softlysurprised', 'ability', 'keep', 'planted', 'couch', 'peeled', 'screen', 'LOVE', 'ENDURING', 'PROMISE', 'up', 'LOVE', 'COMES', 'SOFTLY', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'Dale', 'Midkiff', 'reprising', 'roles', 'Only', 'follow-up', ""n't"", 'gravitate', 'Instead', 'characters', 'Clark', 'Marty', 'Davis', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'daughter', 'Missie', 'Davis', 'who', 'time', 'played', 'January', 'Jones.It', 'ten', 'years', 'events', 'LOVE', 'COMES', 'SOFTLY', 'Missie', 'now', '18-year-old', 'schoolteacher', 'math', ""n't"", 'failed', 'now', 'two', 'younger', 'brothers', 'whom', 'are', 'class', 'Missie', 'now', 'age', 'when', 'ready', 'big', 'things', 'happen', 'life', 'Appropriately', 'story', 'central', 'conflict', 'revolves', 'Missy', 'being', 'courted', 'two', 'suitors', 'one', 'polished', 'scion', 'railroad', 'empire', 'Mackenzie', 'Astin', 'other', 'mysterious', 'young', 'drifter', 'Logan', 'Bartholomew', 'who', 'out', 'farm', 'when', 'Clark', 'Davis', 'grave', 'injury', 'chopping', 'wood', 'sub-plot', 'surfaces', 'concerning', 'Davis', 'family', 'attempts', 'help', 'drifter', 'reconcile', 'troubled', 'past.To', 'quote', 'neighborhood', 'pastor', 'who', 'got', 'wicked', 'sense', 'humor', ""'m"", 'not', 'very', 'religious', 'man', 'Gratifyingly', 'Clark', 'Davis', 'conversations', 'young', 'man', 'Willie', ""n't"", 'come', 'pushy', 'preachy', 'words', 'seem', 'comfort', 'Willie', 'words', 'must', 'settle', 'cool', 'balm', 'anguished', 'soul', 'heed', 'Clark', 'talk', 'God', 'enduring', 'promise', 'one', 'day', 'will', 'wipe', 'away', 'tear', 'will', 'be', 'no', 'more', 'pain', 'hardship', 'suffering.', 'Midkiff', 'portray', 'Clark', 'Davis', 'man', 'integrity', 'deep', 'compassion', 'unflinching', 'faith', 'Honestly', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'role.Whenever', 'watch', 'Janette', 'Oke', 'screen', 'adaptations', 'hearken', 'back', 'Laura', 'Ingalls', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie', 'books', 'ate', 'up', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'Oke', 'long-running', 'series', 'translated', 'living', 'room', 'screen', 'are', 'prairie', 'romances', 'promote', 'strong', 'family', 'values', 'deliver', 'timeless', 'message', 'love', 'historical', 'angle', 'love', 'stories', 'take', 'place', 'early', 'American', 'West', ""'re"", 'made', 'privy', 'how', 'harsh', 'everyday', 'life', 'was', 'pioneers.The', 'actors', 'keep', 'low-key', 'believable', 'restraint', 'narrative', 'sense', 'real', 'life', 'unfolding', 'right', 'eyes', 'January', 'Jones', 'eyes', 'firmly', 'focused', 'do', 'admit', 'Skye', 'McCole', 'Bartusiak', 'who', 'was', 'around', '11-years-old', 'when', 'played', 'Missie', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'LOVE', 'COMES', 'SOFTLY', 'performance-wise', 'LOVE', 'ENDURING', 'PROMISE', 'other', 'movies', 'series', 'aesthetics', 'quiet', 'heartfelt', 'drama', 'world', 'rife', 'rampant', 'cynicism', 'messed-up', 'reality', 'shows', 'other', 'televised', 'grotesqueries', 'find', 'film', 'gentle', 'simplicity', 'lack', 'artifice', 'refreshing', 'so', 'very', 'appealing', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'so', 'Honey', 'Boo', 'Boo', 'yen', 'more', 'Missie', 'Davis', 'frontier', 'adventures', 'check', 'Long', 'Journey', 'next', 'series']",N/A

I am a huge Janette Oke fan. I own all her books and have read the Love Comes Softly series until I've about memorized the books. I was so excited that they were being made into movies. Love Comes Softly movie wasn't too bad. Love's Enduring Promise, however, was a huge disappointment. It was nothing like the book at all. The books are supposed to be about Clark and Marty and Marty had hardly any role in this one at all. The acting seemed weak except where Clark needed his leg cleaned and bandaged after a logging accident and then everyone over-acted. I wondered if they were going to amputate his leg (a scene from a later book, following an extremely serious cave-in). The sets were not at all real looking. I hope the little plot of land being plowed was just one of many fields, because that was not big enough to sustain a family of five. The plot seemed to jump around and not make sense. Missy teaches school, but there's only one small school scene. She has two younger brothers -- Aaron (Marty's son from her first marriage) and Arnie (Clark and Marty's together), yet they were hard to tell apart and had very little purpose in the movie. While Clark is healing, a young man is hired to take over his chores. Once Clark figures out who the young man is, the whole movie is diverted to talk about his story. There weren't really any peripheral characters in the movie -- they didn't run into people in town, go to church, have visitors over for tea. It was like they were the only people in town. When Missie and Willie headed west, I hope they weren't going far. That wagon was tiny (the prairie schooners used by pioneers were pretty large) and hardly had anything in the back of it. I don't think they were prepared to spend up to a year living out of it. Missie's explanation of the phrase ""love's enduring promise"" was way out in left field. The book's title refers to Marty saying that Missie and Willie's ""love had promise, enduring promise.""",1,"Nothing like the book, disappointing",1109376000,"02 26, 2005",2005,2123,"['do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'moviemakers', 'pick', 'out', 'book', 'fantastic', 'story', 'loyal', 'following', 'make', 'movie', 'then', 'completely', 'invent', 'own', 'story', 'am', 'huge', 'Janette', 'Oke', 'fan', 'own', 'books', 'have', 'read', 'Love', 'Comes', 'Softly', 'series', ""'ve"", 'memorized', 'books', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'were', 'being', 'made', 'movies', 'Love', 'Comes', 'Softly', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'Love', 'Enduring', 'Promise', 'however', 'was', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'was', 'nothing', 'book', 'books', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'Clark', 'Marty', 'Marty', 'had', 'hardly', 'role', 'one', 'acting', 'seemed', 'weak', 'where', 'Clark', 'needed', 'leg', 'cleaned', 'bandaged', 'logging', 'accident', 'then', 'everyone', 'over-acted', 'wondered', 'were', 'going', 'amputate', 'leg', 'scene', 'later', 'book', 'following', 'extremely', 'serious', 'cave-in', 'sets', 'were', 'not', 'real', 'looking', 'hope', 'little', 'plot', 'land', 'being', 'plowed', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'fields', 'was', 'not', 'big', 'enough', 'sustain', 'family', 'five', 'plot', 'seemed', 'jump', 'around', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'Missy', 'school', 'only', 'one', 'small', 'school', 'scene', 'two', 'younger', 'brothers', 'Aaron', 'Marty', 'son', 'first', 'marriage', 'Arnie', 'Clark', 'Marty', 'together', 'yet', 'were', 'hard', 'tell', 'apart', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'purpose', 'movie', 'Clark', 'healing', 'young', 'man', 'hired', 'take', 'over', 'chores', 'Once', 'Clark', 'figures', 'out', 'who', 'young', 'man', 'whole', 'movie', 'diverted', 'talk', 'story', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'peripheral', 'characters', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'run', 'people', 'town', 'go', 'church', 'have', 'visitors', 'tea', 'was', 'were', 'only', 'people', 'town', 'When', 'Missie', 'Willie', 'headed', 'west', 'hope', 'were', ""n't"", 'going', 'far', 'wagon', 'was', 'tiny', 'prairie', 'schooners', 'used', 'pioneers', 'were', 'pretty', 'large', 'hardly', 'had', 'anything', 'back', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'were', 'prepared', 'spend', 'up', 'year', 'living', 'Missie', 'explanation', 'phrase', 'love', 'enduring', 'promise', 'was', 'way', 'left', 'field', 'book', 'title', 'refers', 'Marty', 'saying', 'Missie', 'Willie', 'love', 'had', 'promise', 'enduring', 'promise']",N/A

Clark, as always, was perceptive, compassionate, and supportive . . . even when in pain. Marty was more mellow than in Love Comes Softly, but that is perfectly in charactor with her added years and maturity. January Jones did an excellent job playing for Missy.

It's a story about trauma, redemption, hardship, love-triangle, and family values in the 1800's of Midwest of America. Often times, period pieces can be slow-paced, but this film is thoroughly captivating and the characters are well written.Missie Davis(January Jones) is a well educated country young woman, who works as a teacher and on the farm as well. One day, his father Clark Davis(Dale Midkiff) had a serious accident, and was left bed-ridden for weeks. She has two younger brothers, and her stepmother is from the east of America. While struggling to work the land for pre-plantation, along came two men whom would changed her life. One is a wealthy world-travelling business man named Grant Thomas(Mackenzie Astin), who instantly fell for Missie's beauty, and he thinks he can convince her to become his future wife. The second man is a drifter named Nate/Willie(Logan Bartholomew), who had ran away from from a broken home six years earlier, and he's returning in hoping to reconcile with his father who blamed him for the death of his younger brother. He happened to rescued Clark and took hime back to Missie's house. Later, he even treated Clark's infected leg, and volunteerily worked the land for the season.Missie eventually would have to face the decision of a lifetime when Grant increasingly pressured her to become his wife, while Nate is secretly in love with her. Her father had established a strong connection with Nate and helped him deal with his traumatic past. Nate's reunion with his estranged father turned out to be an ugly experience. Missie must decide what to do about her love life.The leads all turned in very good performances, and I think Logan Bartholomew was more captivating, because his character was multilayered, and his scenes were more touching.
