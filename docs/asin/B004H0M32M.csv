Two men and a woman appear to be the last people on earth and already that is recipe for disaster but when you combine a black man, white woman and white man, it is down right dangerous! While they try to figure out what has happened to Earth's population one is more interested in attempting to save what is left of our culture by trying to save art pieces, books etc and the other has eyes for the woman and sees the other a rival. There is no alien invasion here, no mysterious disease that turns our population into monsters. There is just... well nothing! And maybe that is the scariest premise of all. Mankind/humankind will rest on the shoulders of these 3 people but before they realize the true severity of their situation, they must learn to work together if they are to survive at all. A true masterpiece worth revisiting if you've seen it before and worth watching for the first time just remember this movie is over fifty years old but the message it carries is timeless.",5,First Apocalypse,1374883200,"07 27, 2013",2013,1173,"['oldie', 'goodie', 'perhaps', 'one', 'best', 'string', '34', 'end', 'world', '34', 'movies', 'maybe', 'was', 'bloodshed', 'lot', 'questions', 'are', 'left', 'unanswered', 'Two', 'men', 'woman', 'appear', 'be', 'last', 'people', 'earth', 'already', 'recipe', 'disaster', 'when', 'combine', 'black', 'man', 'white', 'woman', 'white', 'man', 'down', 'right', 'dangerous', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'Earth', 'population', 'one', 'more', 'interested', 'attempting', 'save', 'what', 'left', 'culture', 'trying', 'save', 'art', 'pieces', 'books', 'etc', 'other', 'eyes', 'woman', 'other', 'rival', 'alien', 'invasion', 'here', 'mysterious', 'disease', 'population', 'monsters', 'just', 'well', 'nothing', 'maybe', 'scariest', 'premise', 'Mankind/humankind', 'will', 'rest', 'shoulders', '3', 'people', 'realize', 'true', 'severity', 'situation', 'must', 'learn', 'work', 'together', 'are', 'survive', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'revisiting', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'worth', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'just', 'remember', 'movie', 'fifty', 'years', 'old', 'message', 'timeless']",N/A

1407688,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,B004H0M32M,Muzzlehatch,"[25, 26]","Ralph (Harry Belafonte) emerges after being trapped in a mine for several days in a small town in Pennsylvania to find a world gone silent. There's nobody around, no electricity, and no telephone or radio. He spies the last newspaper - the world was on the brink of war, and a cloud of radioactive, lethal gas had been released. But Ralph can't be the only one left - he decides to drive to New York City to find other survivors. After a few weeks there, as he alternates from hope to madness, he meets a young woman, Sarah (Inger Stevens). Perhaps the two of them could...but wait, (this is 1959 after all) Ralph is black! No, that won't work, they'll have to wait until Benson (Mel Ferrer) comes steaming up the river - now there's an appropriate white man for Sarah to marry and to start to repopulate the world...What's remarkable about the THE WORLD, THE FLESH AND THE DEVIL on a narrative level is that it deals with the racial and gender issues that it does - though it certainly isn't as forceful in dealing with racial issues as we might hope it to be, or as it no doubt would have been had it been made a decade later. Deep in the midst of the Civil Rights battles, here was a film in which Sarah's subtle, fairly passive racism, and Ralph's consciousness of race are acknowledged, in which Benson - seemingly a good man at heart - is willing to use his whiteness to his advantage, if he's allowed to - and in which all of the characters battle with what these identities mean in a world where they might be the only people left to care, and to pass on their prejudices to the future. There are some awkward and corny lines here and there to be sure, but on the whole this is an honorable film that really tries I think to show just how silly all these barriers are that we have, when there is no earthly reason left to have them anymore.If honorable intentions were the only element of note, this would still be a memorable film, but as it is the filmmaking overall is of a high enough calibre that we have here a minor classic verging on real greatness in many areas. The early sequences, with Ralph alone and trying to comprehend this new and lonely world around him, are simply enthralling and very moving - though the film never succumbs to glumness or cynicism, largely because of Belafonte's great charisma and dynamic, generally optimistic performance. The scene as Ralph first enters the city, running through the empty streets, calling out and hearing the echoes of his voice, over and over, are eerie and gripping, and a scene when he figures out how to get the electricity going in the hotel he's living in, and dances and sings out in the empty street with a spotlight throwing his giant shadow on the buildings across the way offers an opposite emotion - the ecstasy of freedom and a man's confidence in his abilities. And though in many ways this is Belafonte's show, all three actors shine, and it's very much to the film's credit that they all develop as fairly complex and engaging personalities despite the fact that we never get to learn much about any of their backgrounds.The film was adapted by writer-director Ranald MacDougall from a novel by M.P. Shiel (""The Purple Cloud"") and a story by Ferdinand Reyher (""End of the World""); I haven't read either source but it doesn't appear that the film is very close to the Shiel novel (published in 1901). MacDougall only directed a few films; he's better known as a screenwriter most famous for MILDRED PIERCE and a few other noir-tinged melodramas; at times this film has a noirish edge to it, particularly in the tense last scenes as the tensions between the three survivors come to a potentially violent head. The writer-director also has a phenomenal visual eye, and this film, photographed in B/W Cinemascope by Harold J. Marzorati, offers one of the more stunning depictions of a large, empty city that I've ever seen. Much more of it was shot on location than I would have believed possible - even in 1959 it must have been very difficult to get several shots of an empty Times Square. The wide frame, the small figures within it, and a hugely impressive use of sound (echoes going on forever, the sounds of footsteps heard blocks away in the silence) all add up to a compelling portrait of the puniness of man next to the hard and unyielding world he has created - and destroyed. The musical score is by Mikl&oacute;s R&oacute;zsa. 'Nuff said.Why this film isn't better known is a mystery to me. It is certainly one of the best - if not the best - films of it's kind, ever.  Now that we have this lovely new Warner Archive disc - absent extras as usual with this series, but presenting an excellent transfer - I hope more people will get to see it; it's been a missing piece of the puzzle of 50s science fiction greatness for too long, and it stands near the apex of the great work in the genre in that decade.",5,Possibly the greatest of all post-apocalyptic

It is the best of its kind, stories about the apocalypse of the end of the world. It starred Harry Belafonte, the charismatic star of ""Carmen Jones"" who really should have had been used more often as the world with a man like Harry Belafonte is sadly too going out of style.  It also starred Inger Stevens who died way too soon.  Mel Ferrer brings in monstrous feelings in his jealousy of another man and only one woman that serves as villain in the story.  The film for its limited premise is filled with imagination that makes an apocalyptic film today like ""The Book of Eli"" with its ultra-violent limited premise seem hokey. Writer/director Ranald MacDougall should be congratulated for handling such a human story in heightened awareness of the lack of other people so masterfully.
