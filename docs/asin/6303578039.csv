This chef's got a menu that's off the charts. There is one problem: he  can't seem to keep his dinner down. Chewing them up and spitting them out  is his culinary masterpiece. That's until an unlikely doe-eyed waif of a  girl young enough to be his daughter steps up. Marion, played by Goldie  Hawn, is one outta sight chick who is not afraid to send her meal back.  After being flung around by some youngsters it's time for Marion to play  with the big boys . . . and boy does she do just that. Just wait till the  ending; it will leave you savoring for more. Did I mention the catchy tune  that will be in your head for days to follow. Hmmmm. . . . I wonder if I  can get Roger to find out who sings it?",5,Theres a girl in my soup,969235200,"09 18, 2000",2000,854,"['Robert', 'Danvers', 'played', 'zany', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'smooth', 'talking', 'jet', 'setting', 'womanizing', 'television', 'chef', 'who', 'up', 'more', 'just', 'dinner', 'chef', 'got', 'menu', 'charts', 'one', 'problem', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'keep', 'dinner', 'down', 'Chewing', 'up', 'spitting', 'out', 'culinary', 'masterpiece', 'unlikely', 'doe-eyed', 'waif', 'girl', 'young', 'enough', 'be', 'daughter', 'up', 'Marion', 'played', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'one', 'outta', 'sight', 'chick', 'who', 'not', 'afraid', 'send', 'meal', 'back', 'being', 'flung', 'youngsters', 'time', 'Marion', 'play', 'big', 'boys', 'boy', 'do', 'just', 'Just', 'wait', 'till', 'ending', 'will', 'leave', 'savoring', 'more', 'Did', 'mention', 'catchy', 'tune', 'will', 'be', 'head', 'days', 'follow', 'Hmmmm', 'wonder', 'can', 'get', 'Roger', 'find', 'out', 'who']",There's a Girl in My Soup VHS

While you may think the partnership might fall flat, THERE'S A GIRL IN MY SOUP presents the two talented comic actors in a fun love story, playing mismatched May-December lovers.Based on a long-running London play, Peter Sellers plays Robert Danvers, successful TV cooking host and serial womaniser, who meets his match in free-spirited hippie chick Marion (Goldie Hawn) when she stays the night in his swanky apartment.  Marion dumps her cheating boyfriend (Nicky Henson) to accompany Robert on a trip to Paris where, despite Robert's best efforts to stop it, love begins to bloom for the determined bachelor...THERE'S A GIRL IN MY SOUP (1970) was typical fare from director Roy Boulting and producer John Boulting, who specialised in low-brow sex comedies.  Generally panned by most critics, the film was a mild box-office hit, buoyed by the star power of Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn, who had just won the Academy Award for her performance in ""Cactus Flower"".  Co-stars include familiar British faces like Tony Britton, Gabrielle Drake, Nicola Pagett, and Thorley Walters, plus a ""special appearance"" from Diana Dors.Fun, uncomplicated romantic comedy nonsense.  The DVD includes both widescreen and full-frame versions of the movie.  (Single-sided, dual-layer disc).",3,The lady's in love...,1214179200,"06 23, 2008",2008,1324,"['Peter', 'Sellers', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'may', 'think', 'partnership', 'might', 'fall', 'flat', 'GIRL', 'IN', 'MY', 'SOUP', 'two', 'talented', 'comic', 'actors', 'fun', 'love', 'story', 'playing', 'mismatched', 'May-December', 'lovers.Based', 'long-running', 'London', 'play', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'Robert', 'Danvers', 'successful', 'TV', 'cooking', 'host', 'serial', 'womaniser', 'who', 'match', 'free-spirited', 'hippie', 'chick', 'Marion', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'when', 'night', 'swanky', 'apartment', 'Marion', 'cheating', 'boyfriend', 'Nicky', 'Henson', 'accompany', 'Robert', 'trip', 'Paris', 'where', 'Robert', 'best', 'efforts', 'stop', 'love', 'bloom', 'determined', 'bachelor', 'THERE', 'GIRL', 'IN', 'MY', 'SOUP', '1970', 'was', 'typical', 'fare', 'director', 'Roy', 'Boulting', 'producer', 'John', 'Boulting', 'who', 'specialised', 'low-brow', 'sex', 'comedies', 'Generally', 'panned', 'most', 'critics', 'film', 'was', 'mild', 'box-office', 'hit', 'buoyed', 'star', 'power', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'performance', 'Cactus', 'Flower', 'Co-stars', 'include', 'familiar', 'British', 'Tony', 'Britton', 'Gabrielle', 'Drake', 'Nicola', 'Pagett', 'Thorley', 'Walters', 'special', 'appearance', 'Diana', 'Dors.Fun', 'uncomplicated', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'nonsense', 'DVD', 'widescreen', 'full-frame', 'versions', 'movie', 'Single-sided', 'dual-layer', 'disc']",There's a Girl in My Soup VHS
380248,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6303578039,David Baldwin,"[3, 3]",This is a terrifically engaging May-December romance picture about a middle aged lothario (Peter Sellers) who begins to question his value system when he embarks on an affair with an outspoken hippie chick(Goldie Hawn) in swinging London.  Sellers and Hawn are wonderful together and there is a discernible screen chemistry between them.  My only qualm with the film is that it's central message throughout is to extol the virtues of romance and fidelity but the ending negates that for one of promiscuity.,4,Charming Rom-Com,1130284800,"10 26, 2005",2005,506,"['terrifically', 'engaging', 'May-December', 'romance', 'picture', 'middle', 'aged', 'lothario', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'who', 'question', 'value', 'system', 'when', 'affair', 'outspoken', 'hippie', 'chick', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'swinging', 'London', 'Sellers', 'Hawn', 'are', 'wonderful', 'together', 'discernible', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'only', 'qualm', 'film', 'central', 'message', 'extol', 'virtues', 'romance', 'fidelity', 'ending', 'negates', 'one', 'promiscuity']",There's a Girl in My Soup VHS

Sellers' portrayal of vain, egocentric TV gourmand Robert Danvers is an incisive takeoff on Graham Kerr.

Unfortunately, even a genius falters, and Sellers had more than his share of misfires. In fact, when a Peter Sellers movie is bad, it goes far beyond the usual definition of the term. This 1970 sex farce is one of his worst, which means it's unmitigated garbage.Sellers plays a middle-aged lothario who meets his match in a free-spirited young kook (Goldie Hawn, in her second starring film role), and before long, they're off on a series of wacky romantic adventures. Nothing seems more dated than this sort of '70s ""mod"" comedy, and nothing seems more wasteful than an actor of Sellers' stature wallowing in material clearly beneath him.
