Edward Merrell, Jr. ""emerrell2""","[2, 2]","This was the second pairing of John Wayne and the extraordinary beauty, Gail Russell...the other being THE ANGEL AND THE BADMAN, of 1947, the year before this was made. There was definitely some strong on-screen chemistry in both films and the pairings may have continued a la Wayne and Maureen O'Hara, but Russell was painfully shy and eased her shyness with alcohol. She became an alcoholic, lost work due to her unreliability and died at the young age of 36. But for a few years, she lit up the screen and this is one of her best performances. Wayne's acting always improved when he was paired w/a strong leading lady and that is true here. The story is about a 19th Century sailing ship called the Red Witch which was intentionally sunk by the Wayne character, Captain Ralls. The Witch was owned by Mayrant Sidneye (played by Luther Adler) and his company called Batjak and it contained a fortune in gold when it sank. There is a long history of animosity between Ralls and Sidneye, told in flashback to Ralls first mate, Sam Rosen, played superbly by Gig Young. It is in this flashback story told by Sidneye and his niece, Teleia (played by another beauty, Adele Mara) that the love affair between Ralls and Angelique (Russell) is told. Rosen and Teleia also fall in love, so this plot is split almost half and half between romance and adventure...and each is equally compelling. As an interesting aside, Wayne's future production company, Batjac, was named after the fictional shipping company in this film.

The owner of the ship is a wealthy magnate who used his money and influence to steal a beautiful woman from Wayne, and Wayne is now going to get even.  He intends to return to the site of the wreck to collect the gold for himself.  After a court of inquiry clears Wayne of responsibility for the wreck, the film takes a long flashback so the audience can learn why Wayne intentionally wrecked his ship and why he hates the owner.  The pair battled over the love of a beautiful woman (Gail Russell - what a tragic life, she was so beautiful) who ultimately marries the wealthy magnate.  Along the way Wayne tangles with a giant octopus and becomes a god to local natives before the tragic finale.This is an unconventional role for Wayne; he plays a drunken, embittered captain filled with anger and deep bouts of melancholy.  In one of the opening scenes, he beats the daylights out of one of his crewmen in a drunken rage.  Unlike many of Wayne's westerns, he does not play the straight and narrow good guy in this film, his role could definitely be characterized as an anti-hero.  I'm generally a big fan of Wayne's films, some of the other reviews rate this as their favorite.  I personally think there are several better JW films (Rio Bravo being my personal choice), but this is still a good story.
