1398414,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B004EPYZFI,Enjolras,"[10, 11]","Some movies take classic stories and update them for the 21st century. Avalon High does that - literally. The movie builds up a myth that King Arthur will return and there are portents that it is happening in a local high school. The movie lays down the Arthur legend pretty think. Brittany Robertson's parents are scholars of Arthurian literature. This is no subtle allegory. However, the movie actually does a good job subtly tying the characters back to the Arthurian legend. Who is king Arthur, Mordred, etc. The ending is a bit over the top as well. Still, it's a fun movie for teens - and perhaps even for fans of Arthurian legend.",4,Taking King Arthur to the 21st century,1344643200,"08 11, 2012",2012,637,"['movies', 'take', 'classic', 'stories', 'update', '21st', 'century', 'Avalon', 'High', 'literally', 'movie', 'up', 'myth', 'King', 'Arthur', 'will', 'return', 'are', 'portents', 'happening', 'local', 'high', 'school', 'movie', 'Arthur', 'legend', 'pretty', 'think', 'Brittany', 'Robertson', 'parents', 'are', 'scholars', 'Arthurian', 'literature', 'subtle', 'allegory', 'However', 'movie', 'actually', 'good', 'job', 'subtly', 'tying', 'characters', 'back', 'Arthurian', 'legend', 'Who', 'king', 'Arthur', 'Mordred', 'etc', 'ending', 'bit', 'top', 'as', 'well', 'Still', 'fun', 'movie', 'teens', 'perhaps', 'even', 'fans', 'Arthurian', 'legend']",N/A

An unexpected (and unwelcome, in my opinion) ending.The basic story was good, the acting was fine, but the story's resolution was disappointing.It's worth watching, but the &#34;hero&#34; didn't turn out as I felt the hero should for this story.  In an effort to be unpredictable or to appease some sensibility about what or who a hero or heroin should be, the story crosses the line and lands smack dab in the middle of absurd.

1398417,A1S13O7V60UM9O,B004EPYZFI,"Valerie ""ValsVicinity""","[1, 1]","Having enjoyed the BBC Merlin series, I thought Avalon High would be a fun movie to check out. No, they have nothing to do with each other in the slightest, but the general plot idea piqued my interest. It was interesting to try to predict which characters from the legend that the high-school students would turn out to be.The story held my interest for the most part, though I felt the pacing was a bit slow. The content is appropriate for any age (very clean!), and while there are some cheesy moments, it shouldn't be too painful for an older audience to watch along with the kids. (I'm in my 20's, and I chose to watch it on my own--no kids around!) The production quality and acting are fairly decent as well; Britt Robertson does an especially good job in the lead as Allie Pennington. It's also worth mentioning that there are some pretty cool scenes with horses and knights on a beach!!As the ending approached I thought I had things figured out, and while I was partially correct, there turned out to be a crazy twist that I never saw coming. I can't say it thrilled me, though I'm sure some will enjoy it. Nevertheless, it caught me by surprise, so kudos for that!Overall, I admit that some of Disney's other movies (Starstruck, Geek Charming) are more to my liking than Avalon High, but I still found it interesting enough to finish, and I never thought about giving up on it. Most likely the storyline won't stay with me for very long, but it was entertaining enough while I watched it. If you're looking for something clean to watch with the family that isn't completely centered on teen relationship drama, this movie is worth considering.",3,"Okay, but the storyline moves a bit slow",1399420800,"05 7, 2014",2014,1654,"['Having', 'enjoyed', 'BBC', 'Merlin', 'series', 'thought', 'Avalon', 'High', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'movie', 'check', 'out', 'No', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'other', 'slightest', 'general', 'plot', 'idea', 'piqued', 'interest', 'was', 'interesting', 'try', 'predict', 'characters', 'legend', 'high-school', 'students', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'be.The', 'story', 'held', 'interest', 'most', 'part', 'felt', 'pacing', 'was', 'bit', 'slow', 'content', 'appropriate', 'age', 'very', 'clean', 'are', 'cheesy', 'moments', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'painful', 'older', 'audience', 'watch', 'kids', ""'m"", '20', 'chose', 'watch', 'own', 'kids', 'production', 'quality', 'acting', 'are', 'fairly', 'decent', 'well', 'Britt', 'Robertson', 'especially', 'good', 'job', 'lead', 'Allie', 'Pennington', 'also', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'are', 'pretty', 'cool', 'scenes', 'horses', 'knights', 'beach', 'ending', 'approached', 'thought', 'had', 'things', 'figured', 'out', 'was', 'partially', 'correct', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'crazy', 'twist', 'never', 'saw', 'coming', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'thrilled', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Nevertheless', 'caught', 'surprise', 'so', 'kudos', 'Overall', 'admit', 'Disney', 'other', 'movies', 'Starstruck', 'Geek', 'Charming', 'are', 'more', 'liking', 'Avalon', 'High', 'still', 'found', 'interesting', 'enough', 'finish', 'never', 'thought', 'giving', 'up', 'Most', 'likely', 'storyline', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stay', 'very', 'long', 'was', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'watched', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'clean', 'watch', 'family', ""n't"", 'completely', 'centered', 'teen', 'relationship', 'drama', 'movie', 'worth', 'considering']",N/A
