Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[1, 2]","They changed the theme song.Without sounding like Sarah Silverman's character from the second season of ""Monk"", I was initially surprised when I began this second season with Randy Newman doing what he does best - sign about anything and everything.  Alright, so maybe I am jumping the gun here on this review, but seriously folks, they changed the theme song.  What television program in their right mind changes the theme song midstream?  I could keep going, but I am going to stop...The theme song - they changed it.Monk, our happy-go-lucky, obsessive, compulsive detective is back again, fresh off the doldrums of the first season, we get to see more of Monk, more of his life, and more of those surrounding him.  What makes this show stand out in my eyes is the fact that these are individual stories living in a television syndicate world that focuses on story arcs that at times seem more complex than a donut.  How bizarre is it to find individual stories with each episode.  There is a murder, there is a need for some complex thought processes, the local police are consistently clueless, so Monk steps in, systematically solves the crime, remains the hero, while struggling with his phobias.  That is your episode in a nutshell.  For this ""Lost"" viewer, it was difficult to get used to at first.  It reminded me of older television, but over time, it grew with me.  These stand-alone episodes continue to bring us familiar faces, similar situations with happy endings to give the ""in-the-box"" audiences a hero they can count on.  ""Monk"" may be structural, but it gets better with each viewing.  This second season demonstrates a bigger budget with better audience input.  There were elements from the original series that I liked and disliked and with this new season, the creators seemed to have read my mind and followed through with the changes.  Like most second outings, they begin to grow their characters, surrounding and otherwise - yet, they didn't grow the surroundings.  To better demonstrate this point, I have compiled a list of pros and cons from this second season.  Take it as you may, this was a better season than the first, but still not quite to the level of perfection:Pros:- the continual story arc centered around Monk's late wife.  This is a big bowl of something that has yet to be opened, but when it does Monk's world is going to shatter.- the development of our characters around Monk.  Is it immature to say that I love the chemistry between Sharona and Randy Disher, or that between Monk and Stottlemeyer?  For me, it is the way these characters interact that really develop the unlooped stories and provide the intermittent chuckles through the episodes.- This is going to be in both categories, but the introduction of genuine actors sprinkled through the stories.  Those like Sarah Silverman and Tim Curry bring something new to the table, but it also brings a bit of unwanted commercialism to the series.- Thank you producers of ""Monk"" for revolving back to the original concept of not revealing the villain until the final act of  the episode.  This forces me to think, instead of sit in the back seat while the actors attempt to discover what I already know.Cons:- Can I state this again?  Why did they change the theme song?  Horrible idea, and possibly the worst downfall of this second season.  Randy Newman's voice just doesn't quite match the sharpness of the non-vocal opening of first season's episodes.- Adrian Monk's issues seemed to be an excuse instead of a hindrance in this season.  There were some episodes that I felt Monk was just pushing an extreme instead of actually having a medial/psychological illness.  There were even episodes where I felt Monk was using his sickness to be ""mean"" to others, like Sharona (and her elephant fear) or his neighbor nerd with the money-grubbing seductress.- Theme song ... I promise, it is the final time I bring this up.- The special guest stars at times distracted from the overall picture of the show.  I hated the fact that Dale the Whale was played by Tim Curry (albeit a better actor than the previous actor) because it distracted from the ""Twin Peak""-sy nature of the character.  How can this man see everything?  What are his ties with Monk?  Why do I still find Sarah Silverman annoying?  While she did provide the best evidence that the theme song was atrocious - you cannot dismiss the fact that she just isn't funny.  My opinion only.- The final episodes of this season seemed rash and insufficiently put together.  The beginning episodes start with so much strength and desire, but as we close, outside of the last episode, it just seems like they are trying to make the fantastic out of nothing.  I think Monk is smarter than this season gives him credit for.Overall, I am still working my way through this series.  I think as we go further the episodes will sharpen and the story arcs will complete themselves.  This is far from perfection, but it does allow for more development in the future.  I look forward to keep going with Monk, Sharona, and Stottlemeyer.  It impresses me that a non-consecutive series can compete in this syndicated world, but I have been proven wrong before.  This series works because you can jump in at any time and still enjoy a good detective story.I would suggest for anyone, but as of yet, don't have an expectation to be blown away.Grade: **** out of

864773,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B0006B2A2O,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[1, 1]","I'm not the biggest ""MONK"" fan. I am happy with having the 1st 2 seasons, and the ""Orderly Set of 8"" compilation DVD. So other reviewers may offer a better look at this. But that said, I will give the most help I can.S 2 follows S 1 quite well.(1) First we have a creepy episode where Monk investigates a murder at a school. How could the prime (and charming and cocky) suspect have done it when he was giving a test in front of many students at the time?(2) The Mexico ep is not my favorite. But it offers some interesting suspense. Will Monk's fixations cause him to die of thirst before the killer is found? Sigh. Even with all his fixations, he should know he has to drink.(3) The Baseball episode has a good mixture of suspense and comedy. In the midst of a mystery, can Stottlemeyer and Sharona put their disputes over their kids' baseball game aside long enough to solve the mystery?(4) The Circus ep is interesting. Sharona is mad because Monk scoffs at her ONE phobia after she has tolerated all of his fixations. Can Monk (without Sharona's aid) find out how a woman confined to a wheelchair could have killed her x husband?(5) 'Very old Man' Good episode where Monk and Stottlemeyer stay together to solve the mystery of one murder and try to link it to the death of a 17 year old. For once, Stottlemeyer gets to say: ""I just solved the case.""(6) 'Theatre' Creepy episode where Sharona's sister is accused of murder. Open and shut case until Monk steps in.(7) 'Sleeping Man' Interesting story where the prime suspect is in a coma. Interesting story, but sadly Sharona's vile and repulsive x husband drags the story down, and we spend too much time wishing he would just disappear. Great line from Stottlemeyer: ""Monk all the murderers I arrested in the past had 1 common denominator: THEY WERE ALL CONSCIOUS!""(8) 'Playboy' Interesting episode where Monk shows surprising compassion and for Sharona's sake wants to leave a case so filthy pictures of her won't surface. Sharona has a moment of glory when she fights with the killer.(9) '12th Man' GREAT!!! Monk uncovers a series of linked murders, and Sharona is out of it for once. (Due to dating a man in a high position and getting too much flattery.) Great combination of horror, suspense, and comedy.  Great line from Monk to the flattery distracted Sharona: ""We're just trying to stop a serial killer before he strikes again. Hardly worth mentioning."" Monk really makes the most of his few chances to appear normal!(10) ""Paper Boy"" Really great episode where Stottlemeyer, Randy, Sharona, and Monk work VERY WELL together. With one phone call, Monk solves a murder in France. Perhaps an attempt to link him to Jacques Clouseau.(11) Arguably the greatest episode in the season. ""3 Pies"" GREAT episode where Monk has a chance to look normal as his even more estranged and eccentric brother (who can't leave his house) suspects his neighbor murdered his wife. Not only does Monk have a rare chance to look normal, but there are unusual moments of poignancy when Monk must run through a burning house to save his brother who can't leave. One of Randy's greates moments in the season is when he confronts the killer: ""It might interest you to know we found your wife's body. We can't wait to meet your girlfriend.""(12) ""TV Star"" Monk (against everyone else) suspects that a TV star murdered his x wife. GREAT LINE FROM MONK: ""Let me get this straight. You think that because he plays a nice guy on TV, he couldn't possibly have killed his x wife.""(13) ""Missing Granny"" Very sad episode where Monk finally is confronted with the fact that he may be disabled. Until now he has defended his actions. Now he realizes he may be disabled. VERY SAD AND MOVING EPISODE where Monk starts to lose hope that he will be better. Stottlemeyer is at his best when he tries to talk to a possibly suicidal Monk with a locked door between them.(14) 'Captain's Wife' Stottlemeyer's wife is shot and Monk is surprisingly compassionate during Stottlemeyer's vulnerable moments.(15) 'Married' Monk and Sharona pose as a married couple to investigate a man who may have had ulterior motives for getting married to Randy's mother.(16) Creepy episode. Monk goes undercover as an inmate to discover why a man on deathrow (who was going to be executed in 45 minutes) was murdered. Are the prison workers to be trusted? Is a dangerous inmate really so dangerous? And does Dale the Whale have some vital information that Monk could use?Overall, the suspense, darkness, and comedy are in the right proportions. When Sharona later left, in my opinion, the whole chemistry was upset. The later to come Natalie was just too much off an 'off the rack woman' with no personality. And with Monk's fixations, we need the 'by the book' Sottlemeyer, the young, friendly, and somewhat normal Randy, and Sharona's spunky caught in the middle personality.If you are a major ""MONK"" fan, you will of course want all the seasons. But if like me you're just a so so ""MONK"" fan, the 1st 2 seasons and the ""Orderly Set of 8"" compilation should do.",4,Follows Season 1 Well,1324425600,"12 21, 2011",2011,5059,"[""'m"", 'not',

864774,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0006B2A2O,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[13, 14]","One of the more clever television creations of the new millennium, Monk combines the high-grade suspense of a traditional TV drama with the quirky humor of a big screen comedy. Originally developed for ABC, the show became an instant prime-time lynchpin for the USA network, proving itself one of the more successful shows on cable TV...In Monk, Tony Shalhoub stars in the title role of Adrian Monk, a former San Francisco detective placed on psychiatric leave. A true legend in the community, Monk solves unsolvable crimes via his towering intellect, photographic memory, and meticulous observations. But the one case that alludes Monk is the 1997 murder of his wife Trudy, which forever altered Monk's capacity to perform his job. Suffering from severe obsessive-compulsive disorder and a number of odd phobias, Monk requires a personal assistant, Sharona Fleming (Bitty Schram), for even his most basic daily activities. Yet Monk remains a police consultant on difficult cases, and he hopes to persuade Capt. Leland Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) to give him his old job back. But Stottlemeyer and colleague Lt. Randall Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford), harbor doubts about Monk's mental faculties. As Monk solves cases though, those doubts dissipate and Stottlemeyer and Disher learn to appreciate Monk's special talents - despite his inability to cope with the day-to-day activities of a normal detective... Nevertheless, he remains a de facto investigator as he and Sharona aid the San Francisco police department in solving numerous high profile cases...The Monk (Season 2) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Mr. Monk Goes Back to School"" in which Monk is called in to investigate the apparent suicide of a high school English teacher who fell from a clock tower.

864800,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B0006B2A2O,Mark Baker,"[37, 39]","Adrian Monk is back for his second season with 16 new cases to solve.  Whether he's facing public speaking, umpiring, or searching for a missing grandmother, you can count on two things.  The mystery will be bizarre and you'll get a laugh or two in the process.This is the season when I started watching the show, and it hooked me from the start.  It hits just the right balance of humor, mystery, and drama.  We feel for Monk even as we laugh at him.  And the comedy, while usually at Monk's expense, is done without mocking him.  It's a fine line, but they are able to do it.  All four of the leads are excellent, helping their characters stand out in what could become caricatures.And these mysteries are top notch as well.  Instead of the standard one murder and three suspects, this show usually goes for one suspect with the perfect alibi that Monk has to break.  And there lies some of the best mysteries on TV today.  My personal favorite puzzle from this season is ""Mr. Monk and the Sleeping Suspect"" in which Monk must prove the mailer of recent package bombs has been in a coma for three months.My all time favorite episode of the show (at least so far) is also in this set.  ""Mr. Monk and the Three Pies"" really digs into his character as we see him interact with his brother, who is even worse then he is.  The mystery is well done, but it's the brothers' relationship that makes the episode stand out.While the extras could have been better, this DVD set is great.  All 16 episodes are presented in sharp widescreen with Dolby 2.0 surround.  Each of the four discs has a couple minute featurette.  ""The Minds Behind Monk"" talks about the creation of the character.  There are profiles with interviews with the actors of Disher and Stottlemeyer.  Finally, there's a tour of the precinct set.  Nothing spectacular, but the episodes are well worth getting it for.Fans of this show will be pleased to have it on disc to watch over and over again.  And if you've managed to miss this gem, get it today.

864805,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B0006B2A2O,Mitch Weaver,"[0, 0]","Meet Adrian Monk ( Tony Schloub). He is a man who has a countless number of phobias with being afraid of everything from heights and germs to milk. Adrian is also the greatest private detective around with a photographic memory and such a great eye for detail that it is almost creepy. As Adrian says, ""it's a gift and a curse"". Adrian used to be a homocide detective for the San Francisco Police Department, until his wife Trudy was killed in a car bomb. Three years have passed since, and Adrian's fears have made it impossible to be on the force. Adrian is now a private consultant for the department and assists Captain Leland Stottlemeyer ( Ted Levine) and Lieutenant Randall Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford). Also along for the ride is Monk's nurse/personal assitant Sherona Flemming ( Bitty Schram)who keeps Monk in line and helps him with each case.If you were to describe private detective Adrian Monk, it would probably be along the lines of ""Sherlock Holmes being afraid of everything"". This is what makes ""Monk"" one of the best shows that is currently on television. It is hard to classify what type of show Monk really is. Some people including myself watch the show for the cases that Monk solves. Each case is very unpredictable and you actually have a great time trying to solve the case before Monk does. Others watch the show because it tends to be quite funny at times. Tony Shaloub is an amazing actor and is extremely versatile. He made a name for himself playing the character Antonio on the show ""Wings"". He brings the same comic genius to the character Adrian Monk. Bitty Schram is also brilliant as Sherona. Watching her take care of Monk is hilarious. They almost appear to be like the ""Odd Couple"" at times. Ted Levine and Jason Gray-Stratford are excellent as well.So far, there have been three seasons of Monk that have aired. I could not be happier that the second season is coming to DVD, because in my opinion it is the best season of the show. The storylines manage to become better written and even more entertaining. A few examples of this are in episodes like - ""Mr. Monk Goes to Mexico"" in which Monk heads to Mexico to investigate the death of a man who supposedly drowned while in mid-air during the middle of skydiving. This is actually my favorite episode of the show because Monk's phobia's come into play big time in Mexico. Especially when he can't find his favorite brand of water and he refuses to drink anything until he does. This episode offers a great case and even better laughs. Another really good episode from season two is ""Mr. Monk and the Three Pies"" in which John Turturo guest stars as Monk's brother Ambrose that is afraid to leave his own house. Monk must investigate the murder of a woman that lives next door to him. This episode offers plenty of entertainment watching John Turturo and Tony Shaloub play off each other, and the case is fun to watch unfold. The rest of season two is filled with other episodes guaranteed to make you love this show even more than you already do.Overall, ""Monk"" is one of my all time favorite shows. The actors involved are superb, each case is completely unpredictable, and the laughs are non stop. With the second season being even better than the first, and with each episode being commercial free, there is no way you can pass this set up.A solid 5/5...",5,Even better than season one,1102550400,"12 9, 2004",2004,3349,"['Meet', 'Adrian', 'Monk', 'Tony', 'Schloub', 'man', 'who', 'countless', 'number', 'phobias', 'being', 'afraid', 'everything', 'heights', 'germs', 'milk', 'Adrian', 'also', 'greatest', 'private', 'detective', 'photographic', 'memory', 'such', 'great', 'eye', 'detail', 'almost', 'creepy', 'Adrian', 'gift', 'curse', 'Adrian', 'used', 'be', 'homocide', 'detective', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Police', 'Department', 'wife', 'Trudy', 'was', 'killed', 'car', 'bomb', 'Three', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'Adrian', 'fears', 'have', 'made', 'impossible', 'be', 'force', 'Adrian', 'now', 'private', 'consultant', 'department', 'assists', 'Captain', 'Leland', 'Stottlemeyer', 'Ted', 'Levine', 'Lieutenant', 'Randall', 'Disher', 'Jason', 'Gray-Stanford', 'Also', 'along', 'ride', 'Monk', 'nurse/personal', 'assitant', 'Sherona', 'Flemming', 'Bitty', 'Schram', 'who', 'Monk', 'line', 'case.If', 'were', 'describe', 'private', 'detective', 'Adrian', 'Monk', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'lines', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'being', 'afraid', 'everything', 'what', 'Monk', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'currently', 'television', 'hard', 'classify', 'what', 'type', 'show', 'Monk', 'really', 'people', 'including', 'watch', 'show', 'cases', 'Monk', 'case', 'very', 'unpredictable', 'actually', 'have', 'great', 'time', 'trying', 'solve', 'case', 'Monk', 'Others', 'watch', 'show', 'be', 'quite', 'funny', 'times', 'Tony', 'Shaloub', 'amazing', 'actor', 'extremely', 'versatile', 'made', 'name', 'playing', 'character', 'Antonio', 'show', 'Wings', 'same', 'comic', 'genius', 'character', 'Adrian', 'Monk', 'Bitty', 'Schram', 'also', 'brilliant', 'Sherona', 'Watching', 'take', 'care', 'Monk', 'hilarious', 'almost', 'appear', 'be', 'Odd', 'Couple', 'times', 'Ted', 'Levine', 'Jason', 'Gray-Stratford', 'are', 'excellent', 'well.So', 'far', 'have', 'been', 'three', 'seasons', 'Monk', 'have', 'aired', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'happier', 'second', 'season', 'coming', 'DVD', 'opinion', 'best', 'season', 'show', 'storylines', 'manage', 'become', 'better', 'written', 'even', 'more', 'entertaining', 'few', 'examples', 'are', 'episodes', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Goes', 'Mexico', 'Monk', 'heads', 'Mexico', 'investigate', 'death', 'man', 'who', 'supposedly', 'drowned', 'mid-air', 'middle', 'skydiving', 'actually', 'favorite', 'episode', 'show', 'Monk', 'phobia', 'come', 'play', 'big', 'time', 'Mexico', 'Especially', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'favorite', 'brand', 'water', 'drink', 'anything', 'episode', 'great', 'case', 'even', 'better', 'laughs', 'really', 'good', 'episode', 'season', 'two', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Three', 'Pies', 'John', 'Turturo', 'guest', 'stars', 'Monk', 'brother', 'Ambrose', 'afraid', 'leave', 'own', 'house', 'Monk', 'must', 'investigate', 'murder', 'woman', 'next', 'door', 'episode', 'plenty', 'entertainment', 'watching', 'John', 'Turturo', 'Tony', 'Shaloub', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'case', 'fun', 'watch', 'unfold', 'rest', 'season', 'two', 'filled', 'other', 'episodes', 'guaranteed', 'make', 'love', 'show', 'even', 'more', 'already', 'do.Overall', 'Monk', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'shows', 'actors', 'involved', 'are', 'superb', 'case', 'completely', 'unpredictable', 'laughs', 'are', 'non', 'stop', 'second', 'season', 'being', 'even', 'better', 'first', 'episode', 'being', 'commercial', 'free', 'way', 'can', 'pass', 'set', 'up.A', 'solid', '5/5']",N/A

In fact Two of the shows, 11 and 16, reveal detailed plot points that fire up the start of season three.The emotional element of Monk is reiterated many times, and Tony Shalhoub carries this off beautifully, with Sharona( the irreplaceable Bitty Schram), in scenes like the final shots of episode one with Monk near the tree; Monk shows this in many and varied ways through the series, and the work of Sharona's character is most definitely to highten this effect.We discover the details of Sierra Springs ( Episode 2), the fun and comedy of an offbeat clown( episode 4); the classic lines as in episode 6 where Monk describes ""Speedy Dates"" as ""Dantes 7th circle of Hell"".The amazing care that goes into these shows is even more refined in the widescreen version of the show on disc, that not everyone can see in the TV broadcast version.One element of the show that I enjoy immensely is the opening credits with the superb song IT'S A JUNGLE OUT THERE: the final shot of this sequence has Monk crossing a street from season one, and it is a beautifully crafted shot that bookmarks the summary of the season that has been edited together for the song and credits.EXTRAS:Disc 1 has THE MINDS BEHIND MONK; You discover the successful formula that has been applied to the series, and just why season 1 as well as 2 work so superbly well.Disc 2 has a profile of Disher.Disc 3 has a BRILLIANT profile of Stottlemeyer, done in the skilled manner that Ted Levine can achieve with consumate ease.and Disc 4 has a Tour of the precint.If you love Monk, then this is a must have. The audio, even though 2.1  stereo, is brilliantly done, and the time spent watching this is a pleasure. The best thing about the set, is that you can pick whatever show is your favorite and rewatch it.Ignore the rubbish about a missing booklet ... not true... no booklet like the one in season one has been advertisedanywhere !!![The IMDB quotes and trivia combine quotes  from season two as well as the first half of season three, at the very least. ]ENJOY",5,Absolutely  Brilliant,1119744000,"06 26, 2005",2005,2516,"['decided', 'go', 'trend', 'reviewers', 'actually', 'watch', 'discs', 'reviewing', 'set', 'MONK', 'Season', '2', 'just', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'dramatic', 'not', 'more', 'so', 'Season', '1', 'Season', 'one', 'really', 'gave', 'high', 'benchmark', 'excellent', 'TV', 'series.This', 'set', '16', 'shows', 'actually', 'Monk', 'Solving', 'way', 'more', '16', 'cases', 'full', 'excellent', 'character', 'development', 'detailed', 'thought', 'driven', 'Key', 'story', 'arc', 'one', 'case', 'Monk', 'can', 'not', 'solve', 'fact', 'Two', 'shows', '11', '16', 'reveal', 'detailed', 'plot', 'points', 'fire', 'up', 'start', 'season', 'three.The', 'emotional', 'element', 'Monk', 'reiterated', 'many', 'times', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'off', 'beautifully', 'Sharona', 'irreplaceable', 'Bitty', 'Schram', 'scenes', 'final', 'shots', 'episode', 'one', 'Monk', 'tree', 'Monk', 'many', 'varied', 'ways', 'series', 'work', 'Sharona', 'character', 'most', 'definitely', 'highten', 'effect.We', 'details', 'Sierra', 'Springs', 'Episode', '2', 'fun', 'comedy', 'offbeat', 'clown', 'episode', '4', 'classic', 'lines', 'episode', '6', 'where', 'Monk', 'Speedy', 'Dates', '7th', 'circle', 'Hell', '.The', 'amazing', 'care', 'shows', 'even', 'more', 'refined', 'widescreen', 'version', 'show', 'disc', 'not', 'everyone', 'can', 'see', 'TV', 'broadcast', 'version.One', 'element', 'show', 'enjoy', 'immensely', 'opening', 'credits', 'superb', 'song', 'IT', 'A', 'JUNGLE', 'OUT', 'THERE', 'final', 'shot', 'sequence', 'Monk', 'crossing', 'street', 'season', 'one', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'shot', 'summary', 'season', 'been', 'edited', 'together', 'song', 'credits.EXTRAS', 'Disc', '1', 'THE', 'MINDS', 'BEHIND', 'MONK', 'discover', 'successful', 'formula', 'been', 'applied', 'series', 'just', 'why', 'season', '1', 'as', 'well', '2', 'work', 'so', 'superbly', 'well.Disc', '2', 'profile', 'Disher.Disc', '3', 'BRILLIANT', 'profile', 'Stottlemeyer', 'done', 'skilled', 'manner', 'Ted', 'Levine', 'can', 'achieve', 'consumate', 'ease.and', 'Disc', '4', 'Tour', 'precint.If', 'love', 'Monk', 'then', 'must', 'have', 'audio', 'even', '2.1', 'stereo', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'time', 'spent', 'watching', 'pleasure', 'best', 'thing', 'set', 'can', 'pick', 'show', 'favorite', 'rewatch', 'it.Ignore', 'rubbish', 'missing', 'booklet', 'not', 'true', 'booklet', 'one', 'season', 'one', 'been', 'advertisedanywhere', 'IMDB', 'quotes', 'trivia', 'combine', 'quotes', 'season', 'two', 'as', 'well', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'three', 'very', 'least', ']', 'ENJOY']",N/A

We learn that Monk has a brother, Ambrose, who has not left the family home in more than 30 years because he still believes, sadly, that their father will come home someday after abandoning them.  We also learn that Monk had a lonely and difficult childhood, not surprisingly; that Sharona once had revealing photos taken of herself when desperate for money; that Stottlemyer has a difficult yet loving relationship with his wife.The season finale brings us back to Dale the Whale, now played by Tim Curry instead of Adam Arkin, and a riveting prison story during which Monk learns that the car bomb was actually meant for his wife, Trudy, and not for him.  He must take off to New York for further investigation.This was a great cliffhanger for the third season of this series, which just keeps getting better.",5,Delves deeper into the characters' lives and families,1211760000,"05 26, 2008",2008,975,"['What', 'liked', 'best', 'second', 'season', 'show', 'how', 'much', 'deeper', 'private', 'lives', 'history', 'pain', 'relationships', 'main', 'characters', 'learn', 'Monk', 'brother', 'Ambrose', 'who', 'not', 'left', 'family', 'home', 'more', '30', 'years', 'still', 'sadly', 'father', 'will', 'come', 'home', 'someday', 'abandoning', 'also', 'learn', 'Monk', 'had', 'lonely', 'difficult', 'childhood', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'Sharona', 'once', 'had', 'revealing', 'photos', 'taken', 'when', 'desperate', 'money', 'Stottlemyer', 'difficult', 'yet', 'loving', 'relationship', 'wife.The', 'season', 'finale', 'back', 'Dale', 'Whale', 'now', 'played', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'instead', 'Adam', 'Arkin', 'riveting', 'prison', 'story', 'Monk', 'car', 'bomb', 'was', 'actually', 'meant', 'wife', 'Trudy', 'not', 'must', 'take', 'off', 'New', 'York', 'further', 'investigation.This', 'was', 'great', 'cliffhanger', 'third', 'season', 'series', 'just', 'getting', 'better']",N/A

We learn more about Monk's obsessions, we are given more hints about his wife's death, we meet his brother and learn more about his family of origin, and the supporting characters come alive.Some of the episodes are a bit far-fetched, but they don't take away from the overall appeal of Monk.We'll be buying the other seasons in the future.
