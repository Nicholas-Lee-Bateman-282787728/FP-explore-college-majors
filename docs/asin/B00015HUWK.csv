793444,A1IQV6AI7L9NOK,B00015HUWK,Feelah the tigress,"[2, 3]","I consider myself fairly open-minded, and I've enjoyed alot of movies that others have said were strange.  So, when I saw this on Netflix's Watch It Now service and read all the positive reviews there, I decided to give it a shot.  Unfortunately, I feel like this movie fails on so many levels.First off, I felt like ""Doggy Poo"" was trying very hard to be deep and existential.  However, it is far too overt; there is just no sublety (they repeat the whole ""destiny/God's plan"" thing waaay too many times).  This really kills the effectiveness of the message.  A good movie that wants to show the audience deep themes does it in a subtle way so that the message slowly sinks into the mind and really makes you think about it later.  However, Doggy Poo just rams it down your throat.  Not to mention, the Poo's constant crying about his ""lack of purpose"" really gets annoying.Secondly, the whole premise of the movie gets very hard to swallow the longer you watch.  I mean, a sentient piece of poo?!!  I found it extremely difficult to suspend my disbelief and actually feel sorry for an inanimate lump of a dog's excrement.  Maybe this made more sense in context of Korean culture?  I don't know.  I couldn't help thinking that the protagonist would be easier to relate to if it were something that was actually alive- perhaps an animal or even a bug would be more believable.Well, putting that aside, my final complaint was the horrendous voice acting.  I don't know if they were trying to match the mouth-flaps on the characters, or if they were purposely trying to sound retarded.  I've heard some awful voice acting in my day, but this really takes the cake (by the way, I'm juding the English voice actors since that's what I watched).On the positive side, the animation was unique and enjoyable (it's claymation/stop-motion).  The makers did manage to make poo look cuter than I thought possible, which is quite a feat.  The only other positive thing I can say about this is that I applaud the movie-makers for trying out an extremely unique idea.  Unfortunately, it just doesn't succeed in Doggy Poo.Overall, I was looking for something good to watch that was a bit off-beat, but this movie is not it.  As for all the people on Netflix who said this was a great family film, I really can't think of anyone in any age range (maybe 0-1 year, since they really wouldn't know what was going on anyway) that would actually enjoy this movie.  Children would find it too depressing, and adults would find it too stupid to watch.  If you really want a good, clean family film, I would recommend Miyazaki's ""My Neighbor Totoro"" instead.",1,"Unfortunately, ""Doggy Poo"" was a piece of...",1233964800,"02 7, 2009",2009,2634,"['consider', 'fairly', 'open-minded', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'alot', 'movies', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'were', 'strange', 'So', 'when', 'saw', 'Netflix', 'Watch', 'Now', 'service', 'read', 'positive', 'reviews', 'there', 'decided', 'give', 'shot', 'Unfortunately', 'feel', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'levels.First', 'felt', 'Doggy', 'Poo', 'was', 'trying', 'very', 'hard', 'be', 'deep', 'existential', 'However', 'far', 'too', 'overt', 'just', 'sublety', 'repeat', 'whole', 'destiny/God', 'plan', 'thing', 'waaay', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'really', 'effectiveness', 'message', 'good', 'movie', 'show', 'audience', 'deep', 'themes', 'subtle', 'way', 'message', 'slowly', 'mind', 'really', 'think', 'later', 'However', 'Doggy', 'Poo', 'just', 'rams', 'down', 'throat', 'Not', 'mention', 'Poo', 'constant', 'crying', 'lack', 'purpose', 'really', 'annoying.Secondly', 'whole', 'premise', 'movie', 'very', 'hard', 'swallow', 'longer', 'watch', 'mean', 'sentient', 'piece', 'poo', 'found', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'actually', 'feel', 'sorry', 'inanimate', 'lump', 'dog', 'excrement', 'Maybe', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'context', 'Korean', 'culture', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'protagonist', 'would', 'be', 'easier', 'relate', 'were', 'something', 'was', 'actually', 'alive-', 'perhaps', 'animal', 'even', 'bug', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'believable.Well', 'putting', 'aside', 'final', 'complaint', 'was', 'horrendous', 'voice', 'acting', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'were', 'trying', 'match', 'mouth-flaps', 'characters', 'were', 'purposely', 'trying', 'sound', 'retarded', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'awful', 'voice', 'acting', 'day', 'really', 'cake', 'way', ""'m"", 'juding', 'English', 'voice', 'actors', 'what', 'watched', '.On', 'positive', 'side', 'animation', 'was', 'unique', 'enjoyable', 'claymation/stop-motion', 'makers', 'did', 'manage', 'make', 'poo', 'look', 'cuter', 'thought', 'possible', 'quite', 'feat', 'only', 'other', 'positive', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'applaud', 'movie-makers', 'trying', 'out', 'extremely', 'unique', 'idea', 'Unfortunately', 'just', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'Doggy', 'Poo.Overall', 'was', 'looking', 'something', 'good', 'watch', 'was', 'bit', 'off-beat', 'movie', 'not', 'people', 'Netflix', 'who', 'said', 'was', 'great', 'family', 'film', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'age', 'range', 'maybe', '0-1', 'year', 'really', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'anyway', 'would', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'Children', 'would', 'find', 'too', 'depressing', 'adults', 'would', 'find', 'too', 'stupid', 'watch', 'really', 'want', 'good', 'clean', 'family', 'film', 'would', 'recommend', 'Miyazaki', 'Neighbor', 'Totoro', 'instead']",N/A

He believed that nobody needed him for anything, and that he had no purpose in life. If only Doggy Poo had a reason for being, then he wouldn't give up on his dream to be useful to the world.""Sometimes I feel useless. What good can I do? What is my purpose?

And here I am, 27 years old, a drain on society; my career earnings don't even match my college and grad school debt. Life couldn't seem any more meaningless if I bought new shoes, only to walk out of the store and step in doggy poo. But thanks to Korean stop motion animation, I learned that everything has a purpose; we are all precious and special, even Doggy Poo.Young little Doggy Poo sits sullenly on a dirt road in the Korean countryside, forlorn since he can't figure out his purpose in life. His friend Soil helps potatoes grow, and his friend Leaf can blow through the wind, but Doggy Poo's life seems so meaningless, he isn't even worthy of being supper for Mother Hen and her baby chicks (they think he smells and tastes bad).When Flower (don't call her a dandelion weed) sprouts, will Doggy Poo finally find his purpose (fertilizer?) and cry tears of joy? You'll have to watch and find out. But I could not stifle my own tears seeing this delightful stop-motion animation Korean folktale.
