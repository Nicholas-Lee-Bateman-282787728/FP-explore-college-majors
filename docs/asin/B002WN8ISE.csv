A lot of the scenes are shot from above looking down and it just seemed hard to focus on what was going on. As others said it is shot in one location and as usual Anthony does try to hog the show. So we would say pass on this one and get Pop Goes the Wiggles, The Wiggles Go Bananas, Sing a Song of Wiggles or You Make Me Feel Like Dancing.",3,We didn't enjoy it.,1319760000,"10 28, 2011",2011,412,"['Big', 'fan', 'Wiggles', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'interest', 'three', 'year', 'old', 'lot', 'scenes', 'are', 'shot', 'looking', 'down', 'just', 'seemed', 'hard', 'focus', 'was', 'going', 'others', 'said', 'shot', 'one', 'location', 'usual', 'Anthony', 'try', 'hog', 'show', 'would', 'say', 'pass', 'one', 'get', 'Pop', 'Goes', 'Wiggles', 'Wiggles', 'Go', 'Bananas', 'Sing', 'Song', 'Wiggles', 'Make', 'Me', 'Feel', 'Dancing']",N/A

1297105,A1BKMYEQ6BP5B5,B002WN8ISE,"Maria Beadnell ""gotlips""","[6, 6]","OK, it's the Wiggles, so it is singing and dancing and happy times.The set is marvelous. I love the black background with bright colors. Some of the previous videos, with computer backgrounds and the actors performing before a green screen, left us with staging that was too flat. Here they use the whole set, as they did in the earliest videos, and for me it was more cozy than crowded.Alas, years after Greg's departure they are still searching for a center. Sam's voice is GORGEOUS, and he is personable, and a beautiful dancer. Actually, I enjoy watching him because of the principal Wiggles I believe he's the one with the most dance training. But Sam is a performer, whereas Greg was one of the producers, so while he is wonderful, he is not the same. He's even better than Greg in many ways, but he is not The Same.The circus theme was wonderful for inspiring my daughter to move around, ""I want to be an acrobat when I grow up!"" The songs were catchy and fun, especially the ones about food. Loved the Food Man skit. The Wiggles have a way of making songs about healthful food seem natural, not preachy. (They're the reason my family eats fruit salad!)Most important, my preschooler was up and dancing.

1297106,A6P91OES8GVMJ,B002WN8ISE,Wiffee,"[0, 0]","I have to admit, I didn't think I was going to like this DVD.  I'm firmly in the pro-Greg camp and, while Sam is a beautiful singer and fine dancer, Greg was my favorite Wiggle and the whole thing seems flat and uninspired without him.  My 2 year old son, however, really enjoys this DVD.  He is constantly asking for either 'kokorn' (Hot-Poppin' Poporn) or Hot 'Tatos (Hot Potatoes, a much better DVD in my opinion).While my son took to this DVD right away, it took a few viewings for me to warm up to it.  The staging is small and the camera angles are strange, with high views and the Wiggles looking up at us most of the time.  The songs to me are hit and miss.  The DVD starts off strong with the fun, catchy tunes ""wiggly circus"" and ""hot poppin popcorn"" (both of which I admittedly did not like at first but now find myself enjoying them) and then lags with a string of only okay songs but finishes strongly with ""Murry's Guitar Saves the World"", a catchy song with a fun dance going on in the background.Overall, it's an okay video.  It keeps my kid entertained without driving me insane, and that's what really counts.  It's definitely not the Wiggles that I have grown to love, but, hey, they can't all be winners.  I think there is enough entertaining on this DVD (with a pro-fruit and veggie/anti-sweets campaign) to add it to your collection.Oh, and Wiggles, if you read these reviews...give poor Jeff a decent song.  Both the earlier ""Wake Up, Jeff"" and the new ""How Are We Going To Wake Up, Jeff"" are just awful!",4,Better Than Expected,1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,1527,"['have', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'going', 'like', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'firmly', 'pro-Greg', 'camp', 'Sam', 'beautiful', 'singer', 'fine', 'dancer', 'Greg', 'was', 'favorite', 'Wiggle', 'whole', 'thing', 'flat', 'uninspired', '2', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'however', 'really', 'DVD', 'constantly', 'asking', ""'kokorn"", 'Hot-Poppin', 'Poporn', 'Hot', ""'Tatos"", 'Hot', 'Potatoes', 'much', 'better', 'DVD', 'opinion', 'son', 'took', 'DVD', 'right', 'away', 'took', 'few', 'viewings', 'warm', 'up', 'staging', 'small', 'camera', 'angles', 'are', 'strange', 'high', 'views', 'Wiggles', 'looking', 'up', 'most', 'time', 'songs', 'are', 'hit', 'miss', 'DVD', 'strong', 'fun', 'catchy', 'tunes', 'wiggly', 'circus', 'hot', 'poppin', 'popcorn', 'admittedly', 'did', 'not', 'like', 'first', 'now', 'find', 'enjoying', 'then', 'string', 'only', 'okay', 'songs', 'finishes', 'strongly', 'Murry', 'Guitar', 'World', 'catchy', 'song', 'fun', 'dance', 'going', 'background.Overall', 'okay', 'video', 'kid', 'entertained', 'driving', 'insane', 'what', 'really', 'definitely', 'not', 'Wiggles', 'have', 'grown', 'love', 'hey', 'ca', ""n't"", 'all', 'be', 'winners', 'think', 'enough', 'entertaining', 'DVD', 'pro-fruit', 'veggie/anti-sweets', 'campaign', 'add', 'collection.Oh', 'Wiggles', 'read', 'reviews', 'give', 'poor', 'Jeff', 'decent', 'song', 'earlier', 'Wake', 'Up', 'Jeff', 'new', 'How', 'Are', 'Going', 'Wake', 'Up', 'Jeff', 'are', 'just', 'awful']",N/A
