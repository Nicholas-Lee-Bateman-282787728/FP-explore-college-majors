Moira Kelly is very believable in her role as Dorothy, and I think the movie does a good job of portraying her life.  In a very touching scene Dorothy says to God, ""You really sneak up on a person, don't you?""  This is so true.  Sometimes when we least expect Him.""The film's description says ""Dorothy Day is no saint.""  I'm not sure if that's true.  Saints are not perfect, only God is.  In one scene Dorothy says, ""I don't think God will judge us on how successful we are at changing the world. I do think He will judge us on how faithful we are?""  She certainly was faithful.Having recently watched a movie about Mother Teresa and the poverty in India, I was somewhat surprised to see just how bad things once were in our own country. Dorothy, like Mother Teresa, was open to God's words to her.  She, like all of us, had times when she felt God had deserted her.  Her words:  ""Where are you?  Why don't you answer me? I need you!"" have certainly been mine own at times.",5,Listening to God & Doing His Will,1171152000,"02 11, 2007",2007,1080,"['had', 'only', 'briefly', 'read', 'Dorothy', 'Day', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'much', 'watched', 'movie', 'Moira', 'Kelly', 'very', 'believable', 'role', 'Dorothy', 'think', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'life', 'very', 'touching', 'scene', 'Dorothy', 'God', 'really', 'sneak', 'up', 'person', 'do', ""n't"", 'so', 'true', 'Sometimes', 'when', 'least', 'expect', 'Him', 'film', 'description', 'Dorothy', 'Day', 'saint', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'true', 'Saints', 'are', 'not', 'perfect', 'only', 'God', 'one', 'scene', 'Dorothy', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'God', 'will', 'judge', 'how', 'successful', 'are', 'changing', 'world', 'do', 'think', 'will', 'judge', 'how', 'faithful', 'are', 'certainly', 'was', 'faithful.Having', 'recently', 'watched', 'movie', 'Mother', 'Teresa', 'poverty', 'India', 'was', 'somewhat', 'surprised', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'bad', 'things', 'once', 'were', 'own', 'country', 'Dorothy', 'Mother', 'Teresa', 'was', 'open', 'God', 'words', 'had', 'times', 'when', 'felt', 'God', 'had', 'deserted', 'words', 'Where', 'are', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'answer', 'need', 'have', 'certainly', 'been', 'mine', 'own', 'times']",N/A

As far as Dorothy Day goes, she belongs among that same category as St. Augustine who started awkwardly but finished strongly.  Here is the story of someone who acted on her beliefs and had the strength and persistence to see things through even if it meant hardship and even multiple bouts of imprisonment.The film also addresses issues that many Catholics still face in their parishes from questions such as ""how much should I give of myself or be involved in my parish?"", ""why do I face so many obstacles and even from clergy(in Dorothy's case, the Cardinal) or the very people I'd expect to gain support from?""  Dorothy shows us the way by persevering in doing God's work despite the obstacles knowing that she must be doing something right for the ""adversary"" to take enough notice to even bother to put obstacles in her path.The acting by the cast is very, very good and as far as low budget films go the sound and picture quality are both very good.  Next to ""The Song of Bernadette"" this is the best film biography of a future saint that I've seen to date and is very relevant to the problems and issues of today.Highly recommended.",5,"""Those Who Think Don't Do, Those Who Do Don't Think""",1234915200,"02 18, 2009",2009,1247,"['very', 'inspiring', 'thought-provoking', 'film', 'especially', 'so', 'Christians', 'What', 'saint', 'As', 'far', 'Dorothy', 'Day', 'same', 'category', 'St.', 'Augustine', 'who', 'started', 'awkwardly', 'finished', 'strongly', 'Here', 'story', 'someone', 'who', 'acted', 'beliefs', 'had', 'strength', 'persistence', 'see', 'things', 'even', 'meant', 'hardship', 'even', 'multiple', 'bouts', 'imprisonment.The', 'film', 'also', 'issues', 'many', 'Catholics', 'still', 'face', 'parishes', 'questions', 'such', 'how', 'much', 'should', 'give', 'be', 'involved', 'parish', 'why', 'do', 'face', 'so', 'many', 'obstacles', 'even', 'clergy', 'Dorothy', 'case', 'Cardinal', 'very', 'people', ""'d"", 'expect', 'gain', 'support', 'Dorothy', 'way', 'persevering', 'doing', 'God', 'work', 'obstacles', 'knowing', 'must', 'be', 'doing', 'something', 'right', 'adversary', 'take', 'enough', 'notice', 'even', 'bother', 'put', 'obstacles', 'path.The', 'acting', 'cast', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'as', 'far', 'low', 'budget', 'films', 'go', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Next', 'Song', 'Bernadette', 'best', 'film', 'biography', 'future', 'saint', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'date', 'very', 'relevant', 'problems', 'issues', 'today.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

I had seen there was a new documentary out on her and asked my priest if he'd seen it- he hadn't, but wrote down the name.  He did suggest that we try and find a copy of this film as a fine introduction to Dorothy Day.He was right.If you're looking for an in depth study of Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin, you won't find that here.  You start with her in her early twenties, and leave off with her at about age 40, with a small scene that caps the beginning and close of the movie with her in her mid seventies.  The movie focuses on her conversion experience, from  a bohemian radical who smokes and drinks and sleeps with men (and they do mention the abortion) to a devoted christian radical, all the while showing how her commitment to justice and help for the poor.The movie covers a great deal of ground, and does a capable job.  I think I was only dissapointed because I know as much as I do about Peter Maurin and Dorothy Day (case in point- I was irrationally dissapointed that there was no discussion of Distributism in the film and talk of the farms the community started) - if you have someone that is unfamiliar with these two, get this movie.Peter Maurin and Dorothy Day are America's St Francis and St Clare, and the more people know of them, the better.",4,a good introduction to Dorothy Day,1262736000,"01 6, 2010",2010,1382,"['had', 'been', 'trying', 'explain', 'Dorothy', 'Day', 'Catholic', 'Worker', 'movement', 'wife', 'was', 'failing', 'miserably', 'had', 'seen', 'was', 'new', 'documentary', 'asked', 'priest', ""'d"", 'seen', 'it-', 'had', ""n't"", 'wrote', 'name', 'did', 'suggest', 'try', 'find', 'copy', 'film', 'fine', 'introduction', 'Dorothy', 'Day.He', 'was', 'right.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'depth', 'study', 'Dorothy', 'Day', 'Peter', 'Maurin', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here', 'start', 'early', 'twenties', 'leave', 'off', 'about', 'age', '40', 'small', 'scene', 'beginning', 'close', 'movie', 'mid', 'seventies', 'movie', 'conversion', 'experience', 'bohemian', 'radical', 'who', 'drinks', 'sleeps', 'men', 'do', 'mention', 'abortion', 'devoted', 'christian', 'radical', 'while', 'showing', 'how', 'commitment', 'justice', 'help', 'poor.The', 'movie', 'great', 'deal', 'ground', 'capable', 'job', 'think', 'was', 'only', 'dissapointed', 'know', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'Peter', 'Maurin', 'Dorothy', 'Day', 'case', 'point-', 'was', 'irrationally', 'dissapointed', 'was', 'discussion', 'Distributism', 'film', 'talk', 'farms', 'community', 'started', 'have', 'someone', 'unfamiliar', 'two', 'get', 'movie.Peter', 'Maurin', 'Dorothy', 'Day', 'are', 'America', 'St', 'Francis', 'St', 'Clare', 'more', 'people', 'know', 'better']",N/A

I knew that she had founded something called ""The Catholic Worker"" and that in her time she was considered by the likes of J. Edgar Hoover to be a dangerous radical. Yet she was always only a footnote in someone else's biography. Last week in a used book store at the Library in Cornwall, NY, I happened accross a copy of By Little and By Little: The Selected Writings of Dorothy Day. After reading it, a whole new world opened up for me and I had to explore everything connected with this great woman and her beautiful life. Naturally, I purchased this film.Entertaining Angels, produced by Paulist Films, is as fine a film biography of Dorothy as one could hope for. Moira Kelly, a great actress, gives a sensitive, sympathetic performance in the title role. You may remember her portrayal of Oona O'Neill, Charlie Chaplin's fourth wife in the film ""Chaplin"". Martin Sheen is also great as Peter Maurin, Dorothy's friend and spiritual mentor.The film tells the story of Dorothy's evolution from political radical to her conversion to catholicism and the hardships and joy she experienced on the journey. Dorothy Day was a ""true Christian"", the personification of that very overused and abused term. She not only worked tirelessly for the poor and unloved, she lived among them and considered herself to be one of them.When one puts her in juxtaposition with some of today's ""men of Christ"": the Jerry Falwells and the Pat Robertsons - praying on TV for tax relief for the richest two percent or calling for the assassination of a sovergn leader of another nation - one wants to weep.
