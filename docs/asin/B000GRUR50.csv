I was so determined to get it before Pop died (which he has now, extremely unfortunately), but at least he got to see this without it going &#34;wonky&#34; in the middle like our VHS copy of it. The only complaint abou this movie is that it doesn't have subtitles, so bear that in mind",5,Finally FOUND IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1385856000,"12 1, 2013",2013,364,"['had', 'been', 'searching', 'DVD', 'EVERYWHERE', 'finally', 'found', 'Amazon', 'was', 'so', 'determined', 'get', 'Pop', 'died', 'now', 'extremely', 'unfortunately', 'least', 'got', 'see', 'going', '34', 'wonky', '34', 'middle', 'VHS', 'copy', 'only', 'complaint', 'abou', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'subtitles', 'so', 'bear', 'mind']",N/A

And it's that love that gets them through when they are faced with trials.It's the 1950's, and the store owner in a southern town gladly extends credit to George & Kitty Messenger (played by Gerald McRaney and Tyne Daly), who promise to pay when the crops come in. Unbeknownst to them, their son-in-law raises their bill and the store owner expects payment by the end of the week. Sheriff Ashford sees this as an opportunity to abuse his authority and get the Messengers - Yankee trash, as he calls them - out of his so-called ""fine"" town of Jackson. He comes up with a bogus charge, and the Messengers lives become a living hell. George and Kitty spend time in jail and some of their children are sent to a foster home, where old man Virgil is a pervert who sets his sights on their feisty teenage daughter (played by Alicia Silverstone).The sheriff is played by Sonny Shroyer. I remember him from Dukes of Hazard; he played Enos and he was likable. With this role he sure has proved that he can play someone who is rude, prejudice, unfeeling and downright evil; a very unlikable character.I have liked watching Gerald McRaney's work ever since Simon & Simon, and I have been an admirer of Tyne Daly ever since Cagney & Lacy. If she has ever played a role where she isn't a strong woman who isn't afraid to face her problems head on, I haven't seen it.My people perish for lack of knowledge (Hosea 4:6) is what comes to mind when I watch this movie. The Messengers were convicted of a crime that didn't exist, because they didn't know that - as the lawyer who pleads their case to a judge puts it - nobody in this country can be jailed for debt. But in the end Kitty gains the knowledge and courage she needs to lead her family back to heaven on earth.Although there are parts that irritate me, I like Scattered Dreams. The first time I saw it was some years ago on television. When I came across the DVD here on Amazon, I purchased it immediately. And the speech Kitty (Tyne Daly) gives in the courtroom at the end - so touching, so true.",5,What You Don't Know Can Hurt You,1208304000,"04 16, 2008",2008,2171,"['Messenger', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'as', 'far', 'material', 'things', 'love', 'have', 'other', 'outweighs', 'anything', 'money', 'can', 'buy', 'love', 'when', 'are', 'faced', 'trials.It', '1950', 'store', 'owner', 'southern', 'town', 'gladly', 'credit', 'George', 'Kitty', 'Messenger', 'played', 'Gerald', 'McRaney', 'Tyne', 'Daly', 'who', 'promise', 'pay', 'when', 'crops', 'come', 'Unbeknownst', 'son-in-law', 'bill', 'store', 'owner', 'payment', 'end', 'week', 'Sheriff', 'Ashford', 'opportunity', 'abuse', 'authority', 'get', 'Messengers', 'Yankee', 'trash', 'so-called', 'fine', 'town', 'Jackson', 'up', 'bogus', 'charge', 'Messengers', 'become', 'living', 'hell', 'George', 'Kitty', 'spend', 'time', 'jail', 'children', 'are', 'sent', 'foster', 'home', 'where', 'old', 'man', 'Virgil', 'pervert', 'who', 'sights', 'feisty', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'played', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', '.The', 'sheriff', 'played', 'Sonny', 'Shroyer', 'remember', 'Dukes', 'Hazard', 'played', 'Enos', 'was', 'likable', 'role', 'sure', 'proved', 'can', 'play', 'someone', 'who', 'rude', 'prejudice', 'unfeeling', 'downright', 'evil', 'very', 'unlikable', 'character.I', 'have', 'liked', 'watching', 'Gerald', 'McRaney', 'work', 'ever', 'Simon', 'Simon', 'have', 'been', 'admirer', 'Tyne', 'Daly', 'ever', 'Cagney', 'Lacy', 'ever', 'played', 'role', 'where', ""n't"", 'strong', 'woman', 'who', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'face', 'problems', 'head', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'it.My', 'people', 'perish', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'Hosea', '4:6', 'what', 'mind', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'Messengers', 'were', 'convicted', 'crime', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'lawyer', 'who', 'case', 'judge', 'nobody', 'country', 'can', 'be', 'jailed', 'debt', 'end', 'Kitty', 'gains', 'knowledge', 'courage', 'lead', 'family', 'back', 'heaven', 'are', 'parts', 'irritate', 'like', 'Scattered', 'Dreams', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'was', 'years', 'ago', 'television', 'When', 'came', 'DVD', 'here', 'Amazon', 'purchased', 'immediately', 'speech', 'Kitty', 'Tyne', 'Daly', 'courtroom', 'end', 'so', 'touching', 'so', 'true']",N/A
