This is clearly not a biology documentary but, as some books and movies about animals do, it probably does more for nature preservation, than some scientifically accurate movies.Watch this if you like reading Gerald Durrel's books about animals - the authors voice has the same quiet and kind humor as do Durrel's books.Jamie Uys made a rare kind of a movie - he makes you like every single creature that you see. By the end of the movie you migth not know a whole lot about their behavioural or food habits (though there is some information of that kind  too) but you will be in love with every single living thing there is. Before that movie I only knew two people who could do that - Durrel and Herriot.

This is a fantastic and captivating story where all the actors are all natural, with the exception being a Bushman who is in any case so close to nature that he is part of it.Among some of my unforgettable moments include the honey barger and the bird. These two work as a team; the bird finding the beehive and the honey barger takes the honey, eats his share and leaves the bird its fair share. One also sees a fish that keeps its young in its mouth for protection and occasionally lets out to play. It was amusing to see all sorts of animals getting drunk after eating the potent amarula fruit. It was also a joy to see how the animals and birds celebrate the coming of the rainy season.I have been to all the countries in Southern Africa where this film was taken namely Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe.

Only ""Walt Disney's Wild Life Adventures"" comes close. The enduring beauty of the lives of the animals, their natural habitats and the beauty of African nature all come together in this documentary that shares several scenes (particularly about the Kalahari bushmen) with ""The Gods must be crazy"" films.Considering documentaries made of animals during that era ""King Elephant"", ""Ape and Super Ape"" Jamie Uys made sure the documentary was entertaining and that is the highlight of the movie. However watching the DVD many years later a lot of errors can be spotted. The inebriated apes scene after consumption of the fruit was completed fabricated. The scene where the bushman traps the monkey using the old fist-in-the-bottle trick was animated and literally took away the joy of the real thing. Even the sidewinder scaring off the elephant in the desert, and a drop of dew acting as a lens for the sunlight to burn of a nest seemed phony (editing tricks) though such happenings are possible. But otherwise several other beautiful scenes make this a great DVD to watch with your kids and for first-timers.When it was released in Chennai decades ago it was titled ""Beautiful People"" and it had a run like any of the blockbusters of that time did.",3,"Beautiful indeed, a different kind of a documentary",1217376000,"07 30, 2008",2008,1381,"['Jamie', 'Uys', 'director', 'who', 'gave', 'Gods', 'must', 'be', 'Crazy', '1', '2', 'very', 'differently', 'made', 'yet', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'Only', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Wild', 'Life', 'Adventures', 'close', 'enduring', 'beauty', 'lives', 'animals', 'natural', 'habitats', 'beauty', 'African', 'nature', 'come', 'together', 'documentary', 'shares', 'several', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'Kalahari', 'bushmen', 'Gods', 'must', 'be', 'crazy', 'films.Considering', 'documentaries', 'made', 'animals', 'era', 'King', 'Elephant', 'Ape', 'Super', 'Ape', 'Jamie', 'Uys', 'made', 'sure', 'documentary', 'was', 'entertaining', 'highlight', 'movie', 'However', 'watching', 'DVD', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'lot', 'errors', 'can', 'be', 'spotted', 'inebriated', 'apes', 'scene', 'consumption', 'fruit', 'was', 'completed', 'fabricated', 'scene', 'where', 'bushman', 'monkey', 'using', 'old', 'fist-in-the-bottle', 'trick', 'was', 'animated', 'literally', 'took', 'away', 'joy', 'real', 'thing', 'Even', 'sidewinder', 'scaring', 'off', 'elephant', 'desert', 'drop', 'dew', 'acting', 'lens', 'sunlight', 'burn', 'nest', 'seemed', 'phony', 'editing', 'tricks', 'such', 'happenings', 'are', 'possible', 'otherwise', 'several', 'other', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'make', 'great', 'DVD', 'watch', 'kids', 'first-timers.When', 'was', 'released', 'Chennai', 'decades', 'was', 'titled', 'Beautiful', 'People', 'had', 'run', 'blockbusters', 'time', 'did']",N/A

This is the first nature/animal film I have ever viewed that did not have bits I had to hide my little boys eyes from (nature in the raw can be very rough for a small child to understand), but which did convey accurately the dangers that exist for animals from larger predators, as well as from extreme weather (floods, drought, and a bit of fire as well). Further, the narration was informative and entertaining while not once talking down to my son (or us for that matter), which is exceedingly rare in my experience; other animal films for children resort to turning the animals into silly caricatures of themselves, or giving them irritating voices. Not so with this film. This images captured were stunning and were presented in such a clever, thoughtful way. Much of the music that accompanied it was from Tchaikovsky's ""The Nut Cracker"", which was a lovely touch.Several other reviewers took exception to what they felt was the degradation of animals to comical characters, which I don't feel is accurate. Nature is full of quirky, extraordinary animals that exhibit all sorts of clever behavioral traits to attract mates, protect their young, gain and protect territory, etc. Some examples in this film are the mother duck's behavior to protect her ducklings, the honey badger's relationship to the bird he partners with to secure honey and the young lion whose job it was to protect a watering-hole while the rest of the pride relaxed in the shade. Those are just a few examples of fascinating (and oft little known) relationships and behaviors that exist in nature and are quite comical to watch from the human perspective. It should be pointed out that the behaviors of humans in the film (primarily while hunting) were humorous as well, though I certainly didn't find it offensive or degrading. Creating a balance between masterful, informative, respectful story-telling in an entertaining enough way to hold the attention of small children and adults alike is difficult at best. In my experience this film does a masterful job of balancing all those elements to create a truly unusual and genuine film that is both educational and a pleasure to watch. At no point did I feel that animals were being mocked. Rather, I thought their innovativeness and uniqueness was celebrated at every turn.Like several other reviewers I too am a fan of National Geographic documentaries. It's hard to imagine anyone not loving their lush photography and the far-flung places their films depict. However, that level of documentary is not suited to my four-year old; the kind of carnage that predators unleash on one another in those films is entirely normal and natural, but it is far too upsetting and confusing for a small child. That's one of the many reasons that I am so delighted to have discovered Animals are Beautiful People.I recommend this film very, very highly both for children and adults. I learned so much watching it and had a wonderful time doing so. We three were all able to laugh out loud more than once (when was the last time you were able to say that after watching an informative nature film), and to have lively discussions about what we were seeing throughout the film. Really, do try this movie - you won't regret it.",5,"Brilliant, fascinating, entertaining, and NOT just for kids!",1319500800,"10 25, 2011",2011,3354,"['husband', 'four-year', 'old', 'son', 'watched', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'last', 'night', 'were', 'riveted', 'first', 'nature/animal', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'viewed', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'bits', 'had', 'hide', 'little', 'boys', 'eyes', 'nature', 'raw', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'rough', 'small', 'child', 'understand', 'did', 'convey', 'accurately', 'dangers', 'exist', 'animals', 'larger', 'predators', 'as', 'well', 'extreme', 'weather', 'floods', 'drought', 'bit', 'fire', 'well', 'Further', 'narration', 'was', 'informative', 'entertaining', 'not', 'once', 'talking', 'son', 'matter', 'exceedingly', 'rare', 'experience', 'other', 'animal', 'films', 'children', 'resort', 'turning', 'animals', 'silly', 'caricatures', 'giving', 'irritating', 'voices', 'Not', 'so', 'film', 'images', 'captured', 'were', 'stunning', 'were', 'presented', 'such', 'clever', 'thoughtful', 'way', 'Much', 'music', 'accompanied', 'was', 'Tchaikovsky', 'Nut', 'Cracker', 'was', 'lovely', 'touch.Several', 'other', 'reviewers', 'took', 'exception', 'what', 'felt', 'was', 'degradation', 'animals', 'comical', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'accurate', 'Nature', 'full', 'quirky', 'extraordinary', 'animals', 'exhibit', 'sorts', 'clever', 'behavioral', 'traits', 'attract', 'mates', 'protect', 'young', 'gain', 'protect', 'territory', 'etc', 'examples', 'film', 'are', 'mother', 'duck', 'behavior', 'protect', 'ducklings', 'honey', 'badger', 'relationship', 'bird', 'partners', 'secure', 'honey', 'young', 'lion', 'job', 'was', 'protect', 'watering-hole', 'rest', 'pride', 'relaxed', 'shade', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'examples', 'fascinating', 'oft', 'little', 'known', 'relationships', 'behaviors', 'exist', 'nature', 'are', 'quite', 'comical', 'watch', 'human', 'perspective', 'should', 'be', 'pointed', 'out', 'behaviors', 'humans', 'film', 'primarily', 'hunting', 'were', 'humorous', 'as', 'well', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'offensive', 'degrading', 'Creating', 'balance', 'masterful', 'informative', 'respectful', 'story-telling', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'way', 'hold', 'attention', 'small', 'children', 'adults', 'alike', 'difficult', 'best', 'experience', 'film', 'masterful', 'job', 'balancing', 'elements', 'create', 'truly', 'unusual', 'genuine', 'film', 'educational', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'point', 'did', 'feel', 'animals', 'were', 'being', 'mocked', 'Rather', 'thought', 'innovativeness', 'uniqueness', 'was', 'celebrated', 'turn.Like', 'several', 'other', 'reviewers', 'too', 'am', 'fan', 'National', 'Geographic', 'documentaries', 'hard', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'not', 'loving', 'lush', 'photography', 'far-flung', 'places', 'films', 'depict', 'However', 'level', 'documentary', 'not', 'suited', 'four-year', 'old', 'kind', 'carnage', 'predators', 'unleash', 'one', 'films', 'entirely', 'normal', 'natural', 'far', 'too', 'upsetting', 'confusing', 'small', 'child', 'one', 'many', 'reasons', 'am', 'so', 'delighted', 'have', 'discovered', 'Animals', 'are', 'Beautiful', 'People.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'very', 'very', 'highly', 'children', 'adults', 'learned', 'so', 'much', 'watching', 'had', 'wonderful', 'time', 'doing', 'so', 'three', 'were', 'able', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'more', 'once', 'when', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'were', 'able', 'say', 'watching', 'informative', 'nature', 'film', 'have', 'lively', 'discussions', 'what', 'were', 'seeing', 'film', 'Really', 'do', 'try', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret']",N/A

There was just no reason for the camera to be focusing on that one drop that happened to start the fire.Also, that same reviewer pointed out the ""drunk scene"" was man made, so I checked out the site he mentioned (wildwatch.com), and if you search around the plant section (some plant that start with an m, sorry I forget which).Here is the relavent text:""Due to its well-known alcoholic capacities, rumours abound as to the Marula's intoxicating effects on wild animals. While elephants and baboons both relish the fruit, the former would need to consume prodigious amounts of already fermenting fruit for it to have even the mildest impact, and since these huge animals drink up to 160 litres of water a day, there would anyway be a major diluting effect. Interestingly, examination of fresh elephant dung show that less than ten percent of Marula fruits are actually 'processed' in any way - most fruit passes through the digestive tract intact.Observations on baboons suggest that they prefer fresh Marula fruit and because the pulp is digested and the seeds passed within a 24-hour period, fermentation is impossible. The infamous scene in a popular movie from the 1970s - Jamie Uys' 'Beautiful People', which depicted a troop of obviously drunken baboons in and under a Marula tree, was clearly man-induced and would today be outlawed in terms of animal cruelty.""When I first saw this video, (...)
