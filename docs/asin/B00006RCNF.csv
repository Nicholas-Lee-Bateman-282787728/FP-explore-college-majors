Right now I'm going through tremendous pain with sciatica and piriformis muscle pain, diagnosed by my Dr. (a real MD, not into alt. med, etc).I could not walk a week ago.  I've been taking high doses of ibuprofen, and resting in bed.  I was in absolute pain.I took this out last night as I have a lot of back yoga dvds, and this one, for some reason stood out for me.I put on the INTERMEDIATE - SPINE part, and that is about a 50 minute session.  And I am starting to feel better.  I did it last night and today.Now, having said that, I'm not enamored of all the poses on this dvd, but if you have sciatica, please get this and do INTERMEDIATE - SPINE and you will start to get some help from this dvd.And, though I haven't read all the reviews on this dvd, I know that in the past they mention what the instructor looks like.  She has one of those faces, like Tilda Swinton, that is absolutely stunning in makeup, and looks a little drab without it, but please, don't let you put that off.  She is an excellent instructor, and is calm.Oh and for some of the ""props"", I did it DIY.  In other words, I used a towel for the ""strap"" prop, and a stuffed couch pillow to sit on for the ""blankets"" prop.Don't be afraid to look into the intermediate area, even if you're just a beginner, and ESPECIALLY if you have back problems.",5,Do Intermediate Spine for Back Problems and Sciatica,1217030400,"07 26, 2008",2008,1360,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'dvd', 'several', 'years', 'Right', 'now', ""'m"", 'going', 'tremendous', 'pain', 'sciatica', 'piriformis', 'muscle', 'pain', 'diagnosed', 'Dr.', 'real', 'MD', 'not', 'alt', 'med', 'etc', '.I', 'could', 'not', 'walk', 'week', 'ago', ""'ve"", 'been', 'taking', 'high', 'doses', 'ibuprofen', 'resting', 'bed', 'was', 'absolute', 'pain.I', 'took', 'out', 'last', 'night', 'have', 'lot', 'back', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'one', 'reason', 'stood', 'out', 'me.I', 'put', 'INTERMEDIATE', 'SPINE', 'part', '50', 'minute', 'session', 'am', 'starting', 'feel', 'better', 'did', 'last', 'night', 'today.Now', 'having', 'said', ""'m"", 'not', 'enamored', 'poses', 'dvd', 'have', 'sciatica', 'please', 'get', 'do', 'INTERMEDIATE', 'SPINE', 'will', 'start', 'get', 'help', 'dvd.And', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'reviews', 'dvd', 'know', 'past', 'mention', 'what', 'instructor', 'one', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'makeup', 'little', 'drab', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'put', 'off', 'excellent', 'instructor', 'calm.Oh', 'props', 'did', 'DIY', 'other', 'words', 'used', 'towel', 'strap', 'prop', 'stuffed', 'couch', 'pillow', 'sit', 'blankets', 'prop.Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'afraid', 'look', 'intermediate', 'area', 'even', ""'re"", 'just', 'beginner', 'ESPECIALLY', 'have', 'back', 'problems']",Yoga For Every Body

ALSO, she has the most thorough instruction of corpse post I have EVER encountered on a DVD. The biggest plus is that there are tons of routines on this disc - yes, poses recycled into new practices, but routines which include ones which are short, ones which are long, ones called ' yoga for arms, wrists and shoulders,''opening your heart to change,' and 'for the menstruating woman.'

She always advises to push yourself as far as your body will let you. In addition, she offers moderations for different poses using props such as, blocks, straps, and blankets if one needs them. A nice touch is announcing the pose before each segment and then displaying it in English, along with its Sanskrit equivalent, on your screen to help you remember.For those who complain about the abrupt black screen between each pose, I suggest holding the previous pose a little longer, or do a transition pose like downward facing dog or child's pose. Trust me, there are a few minor flaws in the video, but overall, it is an excellent purchase you won't regret if you're serious about yoga.I own several other yoga dvds and I still use this one quite a bit to keep in touch with the basics.

721753,ACG804LHU688Z,B00006RCNF,S. Burton,"[48, 49]","It is interesting to read what other people have said about this DVD.  I agree with some of the comments from reviewers who have given it fewer stars but I gave it five stars because I use it a lot and because I think it deserves a five star rating for being a highest quality presentation and very useful.  I do not recommend it for rank beginners.  Anyone interested in yoga should try to take a class or workshop from a certified instructor and not just rely on videos.  If you do teach yourself from videos though, get several.  Living Arts (now known as Gaiam) has some good ones.  This DVD is a good supplement to a do-at-home yoga regime.You can use this video for short or long programs.  It's easy to select a program.  Some of them target specific areas of the body (for example neck, arms and abs, spine, feet, hands, legs and hips).  There are a lot of different postures covered in the video, some I've never seen anywhere such as hand or eye or feet exercises and, one of my favorites, the seven easy pieces.  This DVD has headstands on it which none of my other ones do.  There are lots of seated, stretching postures and standing postures.  Sun salute, moon salute, and heroes sequence are covered, but only gone through once on each side.  You can repeat them if you're quick with the remote, though, and don't mind hearing all of the same instructions over again.There are a couple of meditation segments that she talks you through.  These are kind of nice if you don't mind being talked to during meditation.  Also there are special exercise sequences for ""that time of the month"" which is a pleasant feature.There aren't many instructions about breathing.  If you are a beginner you probably won't miss them.  I may get shouted out of the yoga community for seeming to suggest that correct breathing isn't an essential part of yoga; shout away.  People will breathe anyway.  Anyone familiar with yoga will know how to breathe.  So, this video doesn't cover breathing well.Be warned.  Some of the reviewers have said that you could hurt your back.  They are telling the truth, but you can hurt your back from every single yoga video out there if you try to copy the demonstrator.  The instructor on this video tells you with her voice how far to go.  Maybe she could scream and shout to make it a little clearer, but we do have brains of own . . .You don't have to watch the disclaimer that shows up after you've selected your workout.  Just press the ""next"" button on your remote.  Practice using your remote with this DVD because you will find that you can skip a posture and repeat a posture, but once it has passed to the next one you can't go back to it.Main weaknesses as far as I'm concerned:  relaxation poses at the end are too short and she talks through them.  I don't like that, but when she's done there's a music loop that's fairly long (for a loop) you can use to relax in peace a little longer.  I wish there was a printed copy of what's in each program because it isn't always easy to remember where some of my favorites are.  You'll have the DVD a long time, though, so you will eventually become familiar with the names of your favorite programs.",5,"Nobody's perfect, but this is a high quality product",1068163200,"11 7, 2003",2003,3184,"['interesting', 'read', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'DVD', 'agree', 'comments', 'reviewers', 'who', 'have', 'given', 'fewer', 'stars', 'gave', 'five', 'stars', 'use', 'lot', 'think', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'being', 'highest', 'quality', 'presentation', 'very', 'useful', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'rank', 'beginners', 'Anyone', 'interested', 'yoga', 'should', 'try', 'take', 'class', 'workshop', 'certified', 'instructor', 'not', 'just', 'rely', 'videos', 'do', 'teach', 'videos', 'get', 'several', 'Living', 'Arts', 'now', 'known', 'Gaiam', 'good', 'ones', 'DVD', 'good', 'supplement', 'do-at-home', 'yoga', 'regime.You', 'can', 'use', 'video', 'short', 'long', 'programs', 'easy', 'select', 'program', 'target', 'specific', 'areas', 'body', 'example', 'neck', 'arms', 'abs', 'spine', 'feet', 'hands', 'legs', 'hips', 'are', 'lot', 'different', 'postures', 'covered', 'video', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'anywhere', 'such', 'hand', 'eye', 'feet', 'exercises', 'one', 'favorites', 'seven', 'easy', 'pieces', 'DVD', 'headstands', 'none', 'other', 'ones', 'do', 'are', 'lots', 'seated', 'stretching', 'postures', 'standing', 'postures', 'Sun', 'salute', 'moon', 'salute', 'heroes', 'sequence', 'are', 'covered', 'only', 'gone', 'once', 'side', 'can', 'repeat', ""'re"", 'quick', 'remote', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'hearing', 'same', 'instructions', 'again.There', 'are', 'couple', 'meditation', 'segments', 'are', 'kind', 'nice', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'being', 'talked', 'meditation', 'Also', 'are', 'special', 'exercise', 'sequences', 'time', 'month', 'pleasant', 'feature.There', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'instructions', 'breathing', 'are', 'beginner', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'miss', 'may', 'get', 'shouted', 'yoga', 'community', 'seeming', 'suggest', 'correct', 'breathing', ""n't"", 'essential', 'part', 'yoga', 'away', 'People', 'will', 'breathe', 'anyway', 'Anyone', 'familiar', 'yoga', 'will', 'know', 'how', 'breathe', 'So', 'video', ""n't"", 'cover', 'breathing', 'well.Be', 'warned', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'could', 'hurt', 'back', 'are', 'telling', 'truth', 'can', 'hurt', 'back', 'single', 'yoga', 'video', 'there', 'try', 'copy', 'demonstrator', 'instructor', 'video', 'voice', 'how', 'far', 'go', 'Maybe', 'could', 'scream', 'shout', 'make', 'little', 'clearer', 'do', 'have', 'brains', 'own', '.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'watch', 'disclaimer', 'up', ""'ve"", 'selected', 'workout', 'Just', 'press', 'next', 'button', 'remote', 'Practice', 'using', 'remote', 'DVD', 'will', 'find', 'can', 'skip', 'posture', 'repeat', 'posture', 'once', 'passed', 'next', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'back', 'it.Main', 'weaknesses', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'relaxation', 'poses', 'end', 'are', 'too', 'short', 'talks', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'when', 'done', 'music', 'loop', 'fairly', 'long', 'loop', 'can', 'use', 'relax', 'peace', 'little', 'longer', 'wish', 'was', 'printed', 'copy', 'what', 'program', ""n't"", 'always', 'easy', 'remember', 'where', 'favorites', 'are', ""'ll"", 'have', 'DVD', 'long', 'time', 'though', 'will', 'eventually', 'become', 'familiar', 'names', 'favorite', 'programs']",Yoga For Every Body

721755,A2W4W1P1S0547T,B00006RCNF,sobepeace,"[20, 20]","i spend most of the year living in remote places, so i have fallen out of the habit of doing yoga. i bought this dvd when i got a new laptop computer with an internal dvd player. it is just great.used to be i would go to yoga classes off and on, so i have some knowledge of the poses, but am by no means advanced. and i'm the proud owner of what appear to be the tightest, most stubborn hamstrings in the history of bipeds. this dvd was neither too challenging nor too easy. it is helping me improve in flexibility and strength. it is relaxing and ideal as a daily practice dvd, because of the variety and the calm soothing manner of the instructor.there are over thirty different workouts, taught in iyengar style, broken down first into level of practice (beginner, intermediate, and advanced) and then within each of those they are again divided into practices either shorter or longer than 45 minutes. within each of those sections, there are various routines arranged to target a particular part of the body or as a general practice routine. the great thing about the dvd is that each pose is a single chapter, prefaced by the sanskrit name of the pose spoken and written on the screen (only 1-2 seconds). each routine is a string of chapters that takes you through a set group of poses. you can forward to other chapters within a routine if you want to skip certain poses or want to shorten the routine length. you can also go to a particular pose if you want to work on it individually, as long as you note the chapter number. there is no set way to do this (which would have been a nice touch).the one thing some folks might not like is that the routines therefore do not always flow from one pose into another like a live class. sometimes you finish sitting in one pose and have to be in on your hands and knees for the next, for example. i found this insignificant, especially given the versatility this format allows, but it may be irksome to others. another plus on this dvd is that some poses that are hard to learn are taught differently at each of the practice levels--for example, there are beginner, intermediate, and advanced versions of the sun salutation. actually, i wish they had done this with more of the poses, but whether they do or don't, the instructor always includes suggestions for modifications and use of props. there are also a handful of different versions of savasana (corpse or relaxation pose) so you don't have to hear the same spiel every time. the dvd does not include poses that can cause injury if not taught by an instructor, such as handstand and plow. there is a supported shoulderstand but no full shoulderstand and there are several routines that include headstand.the instructor has a smooth gentle voice and explains things very well. i like the no-frills atmosphere of the dvd--simple music, simple set design, one nice lady (the instructor) doing the poses. i'd rather get more routines for the money than views of distant beaches, however beautiful.i have since bought the pilates and power yoga dvds in this series. the pilates is not bad, very extensive in choices with detailed and easy to follow instruction, but i find the instructor's voice a bit irritating. the power yoga dvd took some getting used to for me, as it is a sloooooowwwwww flow version of power yoga, not what you would expect from the title. since learning to change gears before using it, it has grown on me. still, i use this dvd far more often and expect to continue to do so.",5,very versatile and more for the money,1092700800,"08 17, 2004",2004,3504,"['i', 'spend', 'most', 'year', 'living', 'remote', 'places', 'i', 'have', 'fallen', 'habit', 'doing', 'yoga', 'i',
