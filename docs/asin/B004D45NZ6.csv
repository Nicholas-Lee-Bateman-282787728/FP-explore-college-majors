I have no idea if it was nominated for any Oscars or other awards in the year of its release, but it is a film that deserved such rewards for direction, screen play, and its lead actors.  It holds your attention and you learn the sad truths of racism in the almost five decades the white minority government imposed racism on its black majority, and it is factually accurate, based on a real family's trials and tribulations.  You learn something interesting that is not widely known: many of the Dutch-decendants who were part of the white minority had recessive black genes from the early Dutch colonization of South Africa.

1396627,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B004D45NZ6,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","SKIN (2007, released 2008, 107 minutes) tells the harrowing, brutal true story of Sandra Laing (a stunning Sophie Okonedo who brilliantly played sister May inThe Secret Life Of Bees), a black woman who was born to white Afrikaaner parents. If you think this is symbolic fantasy, think again - it is a true story and this does often happen in white populations. While geneticists used to call such events by the term ""throwback"" (as they do in the film), it is in fact a primary example of 'polygenetic' features appearing in a baby (meaning several sets of gene pools contributed 'all at the same time' and not just the parents).It is said this is common with Afrikaaners because they all have black blood in their ancestry - like most white Americans also do.In the town of Piet Retief, Sandra's father Avram/Abraham (a chilling and wonderful Sam Neill) rallies to the Apartheid-era authorities to have little Sandra declared white. Apparently under whatever perverted law they were consulting, the authorities could determine a white person as ""being white but not possessing white features"" (or silliness to that effect). Sandra is declared white. Her mother Sannie (a gentle and convincing Alice Krige) merely loves her daughter with all her might. She is absolutely shocked by all this - and an ugly shock will set in that you won't be able to believe.This film tells the tear-inducing story of Sandra's journey toward 'whitehood' as a child, her journey 'back to being black' as a teen, and her final embrace of the Zulus who seem to be the dominant folk of the area (she married one). In what seems to be the mistake of her life, she rushes to authorities to have herself declared black, so her children won't suffer because a ""mixed"" relationship would have been a crime. Then her husband ends up cursing her for bringing him bad luck, and begins to see her as inherently evil.The question at this point becomes simple: Is there NO end to the evil humans do?Remember this was apartheid South Africa. It's an era about which I know little, but I recall it was horrific and reminded me of what the Nazis did. That meant segregation was more open, awful, violent and virulent than it ever was in America. Black children were kicked like dogs in the street by white people. I can remember that, and I can remember taking a powerful stance against it all for personal reasons.The real Sandra was born in 1955, and what her parents managed to do was nothing less than a miracle in having her legally declared white. Yet the mere fact that it happened and the folks rushed to do this is a disgusting testimony to the times. While the film shows a reunion Sandra had with her decrepit mother after not having seen each other for decades, it was in fact the Johannesburg Sunday Times that located Sandra's mother and arranged the reunion. At the conclusion of this film, there are some minutes of film, newsreels and what look like home movies showing the real Sandra and family. Her brothers - one black, one white - will have nothing to do with her to this day.Sandra opened a shop in the front of her house - continuing the grocer tradition of her parents - though in the film it is shown to be a ramshackle addition to her nice little house and is called ""Sandra's Tuck Shop"" (meaning a sort of diner).This is an unforgettable film, and I cannot fathom how it ran off with a PG rating. It isn't riddled with gratuities of the wrong kind, there is no swearing to speak of, but it is so surreal in its brutality that I would not have rated it less than R. Nevertheless, you MUST own this excellent film, which is the absolute condemnation of a system of evil, rarely matched by any historical evil, that continued well into the present day.Sandra's nearly dozen grandchildren (who help run her store with her) will thank you for getting yourself an education in this filed of history, as I certainly did. There is so much to learn here!I deducted one star for the extreme brutality of the social condition, which I think ought to have been handled differently. It is still very powerful.",4,The title says it all,1334880000,"04 20, 2012",2012,4088,"['SKIN', '2007', 'released', '2008', '107', 'minutes', 'harrowing', 'brutal', 'true', 'story', 'Sandra', 'Laing', 'stunning', 'Sophie', 'Okonedo', 'who', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'sister', 'May', 'inThe', 'Secret', 'Life', 'Bees', 'black', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'white', 'Afrikaaner', 'parents', 'think', 'symbolic', 'fantasy', 'think', 'again', 'true', 'story', 'often', 'happen', 'white', 'populations', 'geneticists', 'used', 'call', 'such', 'events', 'term', 'throwback', 'do', 'film', 'fact', 'primary', 'example', ""'polygenetic"", 'features', 'appearing', 'baby', 'meaning', 'several', 'sets', 'gene', 'pools', 'contributed', ""'all"", 'same', 'time', 'not', 'just', 'parents', '.It', 'said', 'common', 'Afrikaaners', 'have', 'black', 'blood', 'ancestry', 'most', 'white', 'Americans', 'also', 'do.In', 'town', 'Piet', 'Retief', 'Sandra', 'father', 'Avram/Abraham', 'chilling', 'wonderful', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'Apartheid-era', 'authorities', 'have', 'little', 'Sandra', 'declared', 'white', 'Apparently', 'perverted', 'law', 'were', 'consulting', 'authorities', 'could', 'determine', 'white', 'person', 'being', 'white', 'not', 'possessing', 'white', 'features', 'silliness', 'effect', 'Sandra', 'declared', 'white', 'mother', 'Sannie', 'gentle', 'convincing', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'merely', 'daughter', 'might', 'absolutely', 'shocked', 'ugly', 'shock', 'will', 'set', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'believe.This', 'film', 'tear-inducing', 'story', 'Sandra', 'journey', ""'whitehood"", 'child', 'journey', ""'back"", 'being', 'black', 'teen', 'final', 'embrace', 'Zulus', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'dominant', 'folk', 'area', 'married', 'one', 'what', 'be', 'mistake', 'life', 'authorities', 'have', 'declared', 'black', 'children', 'wo', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'mixed', 'relationship', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'crime', 'Then', 'husband', 'up', 'cursing', 'bringing', 'bad', 'luck', 'see', 'as', 'inherently', 'evil.The', 'question', 'point', 'simple', 'NO', 'end', 'evil', 'humans', 'do', 'Remember', 'was', 'apartheid', 'South', 'Africa', 'era', 'know', 'little', 'recall', 'was', 'horrific', 'reminded', 'what', 'Nazis', 'did', 'meant', 'segregation', 'was', 'more', 'open', 'awful', 'violent', 'virulent', 'ever', 'was', 'America', 'Black', 'children', 'were', 'kicked', 'dogs', 'street', 'white', 'people', 'can', 'remember', 'can', 'remember', 'taking', 'powerful', 'stance', 'personal', 'reasons.The', 'real', 'Sandra', 'was', 'born', '1955', 'what', 'parents', 'managed', 'do', 'was', 'nothing', 'less', 'miracle', 'having', 'legally', 'declared', 'white', 'mere', 'fact', 'happened', 'folks', 'rushed', 'do', 'disgusting', 'testimony', 'times', 'film', 'reunion', 'Sandra', 'had', 'decrepit', 'mother', 'not', 'having', 'seen', 'other', 'decades', 'was', 'fact', 'Johannesburg', 'Sunday', 'Times', 'located', 'Sandra', 'mother', 'arranged', 'reunion', 'conclusion', 'film', 'are', 'minutes', 'film', 'newsreels', 'what', 'look', 'home', 'movies', 'showing', 'real', 'Sandra', 'family', 'brothers', 'one', 'black', 'one', 'white', 'will', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'day.Sandra', 'opened', 'shop', 'front', 'house', 'continuing', 'grocer', 'tradition', 'parents', 'film', 'shown', 'be', 'ramshackle', 'addition', 'nice', 'little', 'house', 'called', 'Sandra', 'Tuck', 'Shop', 'meaning', 'sort', 'diner', '.This', 'unforgettable', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'fathom', 'how', 'ran', 'off', 'PG', 'rating', ""n't"", 'riddled', 'gratuities', 'wrong', 'kind', 'swearing', 'speak', 'so', 'surreal', 'brutality', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'rated', 'less', 'R.', 'Nevertheless', 'MUST', 'own', 'excellent', 'film', 'absolute', 'condemnation', 'system', 'evil', 'rarely', 'matched', 'historical', 'evil', 'continued', 'well', 'present', 'day.Sandra', 'nearly', 'dozen', 'grandchildren', 'who', 'help', 'run', 'store', 'will', 'thank', 'getting', 'education', 'filed', 'history', 'certainly', 'did', 'so', 'much', 'learn', 'here', 'deducted', 'one', 'star', 'extreme', 'brutality', 'social', 'condition', 'think', 'ought', 'have', 'been', 'handled', 'differently', 'still', 'very', 'powerful']",N/A

We expected good things, but we were bowled over by the deep questions and emotion in this film, based upon the true story of Sandra Laing growing up in South Africa during the time of apartheid.Sandra looks black. Which means she cannot be in a relationship with a white or even shop in the same store as the whites. But here parents are both white, and her mother swears that she has never been unfaithful. As Sandra heads to school, the color of her skin becomes an issue for students and parents, not to mention a heartless school master. Sandra's father vows to fight for her, and indeed the question of Sandra's identity is taken to the supreme court, where they judgment decades ago was based solely on appearance. Sandra is classified ""black,"" but later, when genetics and heritage became the standard, her classification is changed to ""white.""The problem is that Sandra now finds herself in love with a black man. Her father is outraged and goes to extremes to stop the relationship. Her mother seems to be on her side, but then turns against her, stuck between an angry, violent husband and their grown daughter. Sandra is forced to make choices, more than once, that deal with heritage, color, identity, and family. Does love cross these lines? Does love erase these lines?In the end, ""Skin"" is a powerful movie, told with honesty, grace, hardship, and a cast of fantastic actors. The emotions range from humor to horror to sorrow to muted joy. It is a story that reminds us not only of the injustice of apartheid and racism, but of what it means to be human.

1396631,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004D45NZ6,Grady Harp,"[5, 5]","Too few of us realize the atrocities of Apartheid, a social and political policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by white minority governments in South Africa from 1948 to 1994. 'The term apartheid (from the Afrikaans word for ""apartness"") was coined in the 1930s and used as a political slogan of the National Party in the early 1940s, but the policy itself extends back to the beginning of white settlement in South Africa in 1652. After the primarily Afrikaner Nationalists came to power in 1948, the social custom of apartheid was systematized under law. The implementation of the policy, later referred to as ""separate development,"" was made possible by the Population Registration Act of 1950, which put all South Africans into three racial categories: Bantu (black African), white, or Coloured (of mixed race).'  Yes, everyone knows the story of Nelson Mandela and the end of Apartheid, but too few of us recognize the appalling effects of that system on the peoples of South Africa.  This true story should alter that and perhaps bring a higher degree of respect for those who survived that ugly system.  Based on the book 'When She Was White' by Judith Stone, Anthony Fabian wrote the story (with Helen Crawley, Jessie Keyt  and Helena Kriel) and directs this terrifying but ultimately triumphant film - a story we shall not soon forget.Abraham and Lannie Laing (Sam Neill and Alice Krige) are Afrikaans who live and work their general store in the countryside with their two children Sandra (Ella Ramangwane as the young Sandra and Sphie Okenedo as the mature Sandra) and Henry. The Laings have sequestered themselves because their daughter appears black. Abraham constantly defends the 'whiteness' of his daughter at every level of the government and finally the Laings obtain admission to private white school for Sandra and Henry.  The school quickly dismisses Sandra because she 'is black', is beaten by teachers, and the school calls in doctors and other government support to back their opinion.  But through the tireless efforts of Abraham he finally gets a certification of Sandra's 'whiteness'. Sandra faces intolerance from the community but finds solace in the attention of a 'kaffir', Petrus Zwane (Tony Kgoroge) and in time the frustrated Sandra accepts the warmth of Petrus and they fall in love.  Abraham is furious and casts Sandra out of his home: Sandra and Petrus move into a black village and have babies until the whites demand the land on which the blacks are living and destroy Sandra and Petrus's home.  Petrus turns to drink and blames his loss of all his goods on marrying a 'white girl': Sandra and her now three children move to Johannesburg to find safety and employment, having been rejected by Sandra's parents.  When the Apartheid is banished Sandra becomes a spokesperson for her people and her country because she 'never gave up'.In this history of the Apartheid the impact is made so very much stronger by the fact that the film shows both sides of the struggle - from the white viewpoint and the black viewpoint.  Sandra's father may have fought against the prejudice but when his daughter accepts being black, he is as raw and prejudiced as the rest of the whites.  Sandra's mother (played with compassion by Alice Krige) maintains her love and support of her beloved daughter but by societal demands she must bow to her husband's wishes.  As Sandra Sophie Okenedo shines in a performance that is brilliantly three dimensional - she is an enormously gifted actress.  The entire large cast is excellent, recreating a period in history we can only hope will never happen again.  This is a wholly satisfying film.

Both of Sandra's parents were lily-white South Afrikaners, belonged to the racist National Party and supported the apartheid system. But, surprise of surprises, daughter Sandra's skin was coffee-colored, and her haired dark and coiled, like a black African's. The problems this raised are obvious. How do you explain the situation to the neighbors? And how do you send a dark-skinned girl to racist, whites-only schools at a time when mixing races was literally against the law?""Skin"" is a story of personal and state denial, only some of which are (barely) addressed in the film. On the personal side, you have to ask how such a child born to such a couple? The obvious hypothesis - the Sandra's mother was impregnated by a black man - was vehemently denied by Sandra's mother as well as her father. It's fairly easy to understand why. If Sandra's parents were really her parents, they would fight to ensure that their biological child was given all the privileges due to her ""race."" No matter the absurdity of trying to classify a brown girl as white. But if there was more to the story, what white woman of the time would admit an affair with a black man? And what husband, eager to deny his cuckolding would admit to the ""unimaginable"" conclusion of his wife's infidelity?The South African state also had to perform mental gymnastics in its efforts to handle the case. When racial classification was de rigueur for determining which citizens were afforded which rights, the state could not tolerate ambiguity. There was more than one man's paternity involved, as South African whites had to deal with the reality that many of them had black blood - the legacy of liaisons, consensual and otherwise, between the early Dutch settlers and the native population. Could this Boer original sin have come back to haunt Sandra's parents? The courts and some scientists thought so, perhaps reaching for a face-saving way to deny an act impossible to countenance, and Sandra was officially classified as white.The situation would be comical if it didn't have such drastic consequences. In South Africa of the 1960s and 70s, people went to court to have their race changed - that is, to alter the racial category on their identity cards -- from black to colored to white. It wasn't a matter of trying to ""pass"" as another race. Race, in apartheid South Africa, had its privileges - from the street where you could build a home, to the school you attended - even to the kind of food you were allowed when in prison. No wonder that with stakes this high, people would fight ferociously over their racial classification.In Sandra's case, the controversy came at a high price. Her identity as a white clashed with her appearance, court findings notwithstanding. Her struggles - with rejection, humiliation, poverty and violence - turned a beloved and happy child into fearful, shy and reclusive adult. Though she was able to harness her inner spirit to bring something positive out of tragedy, the scars of abandonment and self-doubt remained.The film's one weakness as that it played it safe, steadfastly refusing to make conclusions about Sandra's race or the possibility of her mother's extramarital liaisons. The horros of apartheid were only hinted at. But given those constraints, the acting in ""Skin"" was superb. Alice Krige and Sophie Okonedo (playing Sandra as a child and an adult) captured the many facets of this complex story. Sam Neill played her double-natured, both in love with his daughter and insistent that she conform to his prejudices.  Skin is a fine film that, while pulling back on the horrors of living with racists in a racist society, explores the way that the hue of one's skin literally colors a person's destiny and their level of acceptance in society.Given our world's current struggles with dark-skinned ""terrorists"" and ""illegals"" and a part-white, part-black American president, the time is still ripe for an examination of a topic that is literally skin deep",5,And ugly goes right to the bone,1341705600,"07 8, 2012",2012,4102,"['Skin', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'Sandra', 'Laing', 'woman', 'born', '1955', 'dark', 'days', 'South', 'African', 'apartheid', 'Sandra', 'parents', 'were', 'lily-white', 'South', 'Afrikaners', 'belonged', 'racist', 'National', 'Party', 'supported', 'apartheid', 'system', 'surprise', 'surprises', 'daughter', 'Sandra', 'skin', 'was', 'coffee-colored', 'haired', 'dark', 'coiled', 'black', 'African', 'problems', 'raised', 'are', 'obvious', 'How', 'do', 'explain', 'situation', 'neighbors', 'how', 'do', 'send', 'dark-skinned', 'girl', 'racist', 'whites-only', 'schools', 'time', 'when', 'mixing', 'races', 'was', 'literally', 'law', 'Skin', 'story', 'personal', 'state', 'denial', 'only', 'are', 'barely', 'addressed', 'film', 'personal', 'side', 'have', 'ask', 'how', 'such', 'child', 'born', 'such', 'couple', 'obvious', 'hypothesis', 'Sandra', 'mother', 'was', 'impregnated', 'black', 'man', 'was', 'vehemently', 'denied', 'Sandra', 'mother', 'as', 'well', 'father', 'fairly', 'easy', 'understand', 'why', 'Sandra', 'parents', 'were', 'really', 'parents', 'would', 'fight', 'ensure', 'biological', 'child', 'was', 'given', 'privileges', 'due', 'race', 'matter', 'absurdity', 'trying', 'classify', 'brown', 'girl', 'white', 'was', 'more', 'story', 'what', 'white', 'woman', 'time', 'would', 'admit', 'affair', 'black', 'man', 'what', 'husband', 'eager', 'deny', 'cuckolding', 'would', 'admit', 'unimaginable', 'conclusion', 'wife', 'infidelity', 'South', 'African', 'state', 'also', 'had', 'perform', 'mental', 'gymnastics', 'efforts', 'handle', 'case', 'When', 'racial', 'classification', 'was', 'de', 'rigueur', 'determining', 'citizens', 'were', 'afforded', 'rights', 'state', 'could', 'not', 'tolerate', 'ambiguity', 'was', 'more', 'one', 'man', 'paternity', 'involved', 'South', 'African', 'whites', 'had', 'deal', 'reality', 'many', 'had', 'black', 'blood', 'legacy', 'liaisons', 'consensual', 'otherwise', 'early', 'Dutch', 'settlers', 'native', 'population', 'Could', 'Boer', 'original', 'sin', 'have', 'come', 'back', 'haunt', 'Sandra', 'parents', 'courts', 'scientists', 'thought', 'so', 'perhaps', 'reaching', 'face-saving', 'way', 'deny', 'act', 'impossible', 'countenance', 'Sandra', 'was', 'officially', 'classified', 'white.The', 'situation', 'would', 'be', 'comical', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'such', 'drastic', 'consequences', 'South', 'Africa', '1960s', '70s', 'people', 'went', 'court', 'have', 'race', 'changed', 'alter', 'racial', 'category', 'identity', 'cards', 'black', 'colored', 'white', 'was', ""n't"", 'matter', 'trying', 'pass', 'race', 'Race', 'apartheid', 'South', 'Africa', 'had', 'privileges', 'street', 'where', 'could', 'build', 'home', 'school', 'attended', 'even', 'kind', 'food', 'were', 'allowed', 'when', 'prison', 'wonder', 'stakes', 'high', 'people', 'would', 'fight', 'ferociously', 'racial', 'classification.In', 'Sandra', 'case', 'controversy', 'came', 'high', 'price', 'identity', 'white', 'clashed', 'appearance', 'court', 'findings', 'notwithstanding', 'struggles', 'rejection', 'humiliation', 'poverty', 'violence', 'turned', 'beloved', 'happy', 'child', 'fearful', 'shy', 'reclusive', 'adult', 'was', 'able', 'harness', 'inner', 'spirit', 'bring', 'something', 'positive', 'tragedy', 'scars', 'abandonment', 'self-doubt', 'remained.The', 'film', 'one', 'weakness', 'played', 'safe', 'steadfastly', 'refusing', 'make', 'conclusions', 'Sandra', 'race', 'possibility', 'mother', 'extramarital', 'liaisons', 'horros', 'apartheid', 'were', 'only', 'hinted', 'given', 'constraints', 'acting', 'Skin', 'was', 'superb', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'Sophie', 'Okonedo', 'playing', 'Sandra', 'child', 'adult', 'captured', 'many', 'facets', 'complex', 'story', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'played', 'double-natured', 'love', 'daughter', 'insistent', 'conform', 'prejudices', 'Skin', 'fine', 'film', 'pulling', 'back', 'horrors', 'living', 'racists', 'racist', 'society', 'way', 'hue', 'one', 'skin', 'literally', 'person', 'destiny', 'level', 'acceptance', 'society.Given', 'world', 'current', 'struggles', 'dark-skinned', 'terrorists', 'illegals', 'part-white', 'part-black', 'American', 'president', 'time', 'still', 'ripe', 'examination', 'topic', 'literally', 'skin', 'deep']",N/A

Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[2, 2]","I guess for a long time to come films will be made about apartheid in South Africa: in its devastating consequences for all people involved even long after it is declared illegal. ""Skin"" holds up a blinding mirror to show apartheid's incendiary damage to just one family.Pa and Ma are your typical Afrikaner family--white, middle-class, with eventually three children. Typical becomes atypical with the birth of that first child--female and definitely not white, but definitely theirs. Pa, played sternly by Sam Neill, goes through legal precedent to have their young daughter, Sandra,  declared ""white."" It seems that geneticists had already begun their study in the occasional birth of ""black"" children into ""white"" families. So, African Sandra appeared, Afrikaner she was proclaimed.Can you imagine Sandra's dilemma growing up? Legally white, but with the visible stain of the legacy of racist society reminding her at every turn that she is an enigma? At her graduation her parents seek out a potential husband for her. Each white man knows she is ""white"" but treats her as she looks to him. Meanwhile, fully feeling her contradictory status, Sandra falls in love with a local African who does business with her father in his produce store.Can you imagine Sandra's pain at choosing between her birthright and her physical calling. Sophie Okonedo plays Sandra's pain with perfect pitch. They have a baby and live happily within the confines of an African village, one of the makeshift kind on the edge of white society. But it's home and finally, Sandra is welcome and happy.Can you imagine Sandra's pain to learn her father burns every iota of Sandra out of their lives. She chose black instead of white. He could not bend his racist heritage to accept an African into his family, although by skin, his daughter has African heritage. No, no, legally, she is white.And, thus, we meet the ugly fist of racism in just one of its myriad forms. Whether it is apartheid in South Africa or slavery and the aftermath of the ""end"" of slavery in the United States or whatever form it takes across the world, racism is ugly, vile, destructive, and ultimately, incendiary, as is the symbol of fire eating up all traces of blackness out of Pa's household. Sam Neill's character has white skin, the good skin, the skin of acceptance and dominance and all the good things of life. Sandra chose the other. That was unforgivable.There's more, of course, to this story, a true story, but I have given enough of an introduction to its whole. Just as Americans have made many films, written many books bout the ugliness of racism in their own country, to try to explain it away, to understand it, to finally acknowledge it, South Africans are working through their own ugliness.

The life of Sandra Laing coincided with tremendous change in her country. She was smart, well-behaved, and properly raised by her parents.

The school quickly rejects her because of parents' complaints about her skin color. Mr. Laing fights the government to get her classified as white. The law states that someone is white based on their appearance rather than the color of their parents. It takes many years, but eventually she is reclassified from colored to white.At age 16, Sandra falls in love with a black man, a relationship which jeopardizes her status in life as well as the safety of her family.

I doubt we value the lessons learned from the our own past as we do from school. Imagine a world where you are classified according to what the government laws dictate. That was the reality of Apartheid South Africa.Even in 2013 we see glimpses of this Apartheid mentality because mixed race people in this country seems to have a Pavlovian disposition to feeling inferior and acting that way. The violence among ""coloured people"" is disproportional higher when looked at prison populations. So this movie is actually an important link between the past, the present and the future of mixed race people in South Africa.What is striking about Sandra Laing is how her parents are both supremely dedicated and yet divided in how they treat their daughter. Everything manages to proceed as planned while she's in school, and even after she's asked to leave the school. Even her older brother stands by her even though he admits it's difficult.How do we break free from our parents, from our roots and discover new ones? There is a Freudian element to Sandra's relationship with her father. He fights for her, he is strong-willed and takes on the government in one scene. Yet, he has doubts about whether she is indeed his biological child. At least this makes him human in sense. The family is surrounded by black people, some as labourers and some as clients in their shop in a rural part of the country.As she matures into a young lady, her father arranges dates for her with young white men. After a terrible incident where she avoids being rapped, she eventually strikes up a sexual relationship with a black man with whom she has two children. His anger sparked by group areas act, and how it was enforced in by the Apartheid government eventually leads to him physically abusing Sandra. She leaves with her children and makes her way to Johannesburg, the big city.The movie ends where it began with the 1994 elections. The dream that was dreamed by her parents is still alive in her, especially her father's motto of ""never give up."" She tells her mother on her death bed, that was all that kept her going during the 20 years of separation.This is a story that speaks about all those things that makes us human: family, identity, uncertainty, choice and love.

Still, at the age of ten, facing prejudice from her community due to her dark skin and African features, Sandra is driven out of her society.  The film follows Sandra's 30-year odyssey from rejection to acceptance, betrayal to reconciliation, as she struggles to define her place in a changing world against countless obstacles.Ms. Okonedo plays Sandra not as a symbol of black struggle in apartheid-era South Africa but as a determined woman attempting to discover her true self.  As a mature woman and mother, her Sandra still looks to heal psychological wounds inflicted on her as a child.  South Africa's Population Registration Act of 1950 required people to be identified, defined, classified, and separated by color, but in Sandra's home town, folks were less intolerant.O'Neill's Abraham is sympathetic as he attempts to have the law changed so Sandra can be classified by heritage rather than appearance, but also reveals himself to have deep-seated racism.Bonus extras include a behind-the-scenes featurette, deleted scenes, outtakes, and script development workshops.",4,Courage Under Pressure,1297814400,"02 16, 2011",2011,1374,"['Skin', 'story', 'Sandra', 'Laing', 'Sophie', 'Okonedo', 'born', 'black', '1950', 'white', 'Afrikaners', 'unaware', 'black', 'ancestry', 'parents', 'rural', 'shopkeepers', 'Abraham', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'Sannie', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'who', 'serve', 'local', 'black', 'community', 'lovingly', 'raise', 'white', 'little', 'girl', 'Still', 'age', 'ten', 'facing', 'prejudice', 'community', 'due', 'dark', 'skin', 'African', 'features', 'Sandra', 'driven', 'society', 'film', 'Sandra', '30-year', 'odyssey', 'rejection', 'acceptance', 'betrayal', 'reconciliation', 'define', 'place', 'changing', 'world', 'countless', 'obstacles.Ms', 'Okonedo', 'Sandra', 'not', 'symbol', 'black', 'struggle', 'apartheid-era', 'South', 'Africa', 'determined', 'woman', 'attempting', 'discover', 'true', 'self', 'mature', 'woman', 'mother', 'Sandra', 'still', 'heal', 'psychological', 'wounds', 'inflicted', 'child', 'South', 'Africa', 'Population', 'Registration', 'Act', '1950', 'required', 'people', 'be', 'identified', 'defined', 'classified', 'separated', 'color', 'Sandra', 'home', 'town', 'folks', 'were', 'less', ""intolerant.O'Neill"", 'Abraham', 'sympathetic', 'have', 'law', 'changed', 'so', 'Sandra', 'can', 'be', 'classified', 'heritage', 'rather', 'appearance', 'also', 'have', 'deep-seated', 'racism.Bonus', 'extras', 'include', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'outtakes', 'script', 'development', 'workshops']",N/A
