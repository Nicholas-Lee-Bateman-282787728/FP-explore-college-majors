Wrong. This is a tremendous series and this is its best season. Cracker is the UK term for a criminal psychologist and Cracker as played by Robbie Coltrane (Harry Potter) is one of the most memorable psychologist detectives of all time. Coltrane is a big hearted, big bodied, hard headed, gambling, drinking real person. His flaws are not overplayed, but you get a whole person. The writing for this series is at a very level so that every episode is original and unpredictable. The only clear comparison I can think of is ITV's, Vincent, which is also not to be missed. While Robbie is effective at ""cracking"" criminals, he not a magician of the more typical US mold. Interestingly, there is some real criminal psychology underpinning the series.

788709,A24DF386LKALP4,B0000X2EU6,Nick,"[0, 0]","Not that it becomes an unwatchably bad show after this point, it doesn't by any means. There are still some great stories, especially in the third series, but as far as this set goes...'To Be a Somebody' outshines the others in a lot of ways. But, then again, that was also the point when they started having another writer coming in.First of all, the story of 'To Be a Somebody' is complex, emotional, and it rides on the same concept of humanity, and logic that made previous episodes so successful and brilliant. 'Cracker' manages to take a character, show you the character, and then delve under the skin of the character and show you their workings. It's all about the psychology of the characters, going along with Fitz's speciality. All the characters, no matter how unlikeable or seemingly cruel, are still completely human and sympathetic. You know why they're doing what they're doing, and you know why they think what they're doing is &#34;right&#34;, in their minds.The fact that you can sympathise with these criminal characters, but still realise that they are not good people, is the strongest, most horrifying trait of the 'Cracker' series up to this point. After 'To Be a Somebody', this quality is a little bit lost. Though the stories are still good, and the acting still remarkable, the later episodes just don't hold up with the earlier ones.But I'm getting off course. Another remarkable thing about the episode 'To Be a Somebody' is the acting. All the characters go through some unbelievable emotional turbulence, and the acting is brilliant. And then, of course, there's Robert Carlyle in the role of the criminal, who manages to steal the show despite the already remarkably strong casting. Every scene with him is just mesmerising--he does unbelievably well in the role.The other two stories are good, but they lack the same humanity and realism of the previous episodes. 'The Big Crunch' is probably the worse episode of the series...it struck me as very cobbled together and very unrealistic. 'Men Should Weep' was better, but still had its flaws. I have to admit, the emotional and character value was on the rise again in that episode, however, and those were its best aspects.All in all, it's definitely worth the buy for 'Cracker' and crime show fans alike.

788712,A307LZV1TBCJJO,B0000X2EU6,phimseto,"[60, 64]","File ""Cracker"" series two under that rare category of ""Great Television Seasons of All-Time.""The second season of Cracker picks up a short while after the events of series one.  On the personal front, Fitz and his wife are still coping with their marriage issues while at the same time he deals with a rather put-out Jane Penhaligon and the affair that wasn't.  On the professional front, the gambling debts weigh a little heavier as Fitz finds his police work curbed courtesy of a standing grudge between himself and DCI Bilborough over their last case together.Into these lives come three extraordinary stories and a cast of characters that will irreversibly change the course of events in Fitz's world.  The first story, ""To Be A Somebody"", is considered the strongest of all three seasons.  It features a tour de force performance by Robert Carlyle of ""Trainspotting"" fame in a teleplay that discourses vitriolically on themes of immigration, family, and class warfare.  The second story, ""The Big Crunch"", features Jim Carter (Brassed Off) and Samantha Morton (Minority Report) in a melancholy tale of greys in the decidedly black and white world of organized religion.  The final story of the season, ""Men Should Weep"" offers no denouement and no respite, a powerful and personal story that will leave you waiting breathlessly for the release of series three.Through all the tales of crime and punishment, the story of Fitz and his life is interweaved.  The beauty of the show, indeed its greatest strength, is in how seemlessly that story is told and how it manages to compliment the overarching plot of each episode.  ""Cracker"" is as good as television gets, and season two is the very best of a great series.",5,"Marriage, Life, and Whiskey - all on the rocks.",1072742400,"12 30, 2003",2003,1717,"['Cracker', 'series', 'two', 'rare', 'category', 'Great', 'Television', 'Seasons', 'All-Time', 'second', 'season', 'Cracker', 'up', 'short', 'while', 'events', 'series', 'one', 'personal', 'front', 'Fitz', 'wife', 'are', 'still', 'coping', 'marriage', 'issues', 'same', 'time', 'rather', 'put-out', 'Jane', 'Penhaligon', 'affair', 'was', ""n't"", 'professional', 'front', 'gambling', 'debts', 'weigh', 'little', 'heavier', 'Fitz', 'police', 'work', 'curbed', 'courtesy', 'standing', 'grudge', 'DCI', 'Bilborough', 'last', 'case', 'lives', 'come', 'three', 'extraordinary', 'stories', 'cast', 'characters', 'will', 'irreversibly', 'change', 'course', 'events', 'Fitz', 'world', 'first', 'story', 'Be', 'Somebody', 'considered', 'strongest', 'three', 'seasons', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'performance', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'Trainspotting', 'fame', 'teleplay', 'vitriolically', 'themes', 'immigration', 'family', 'class', 'warfare', 'second', 'story', 'Big', 'Crunch', 'Jim', 'Carter', 'Brassed', 'Off', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'Minority', 'Report', 'melancholy', 'tale', 'greys', 'decidedly', 'black', 'white', 'world', 'organized', 'religion', 'final', 'story', 'season', 'Men', 'Should', 'Weep', 'denouement', 'respite', 'powerful', 'personal', 'story', 'will', 'leave', 'waiting', 'breathlessly', 'release', 'series', 'tales', 'crime', 'punishment', 'story', 'Fitz', 'life', 'interweaved', 'beauty', 'show', 'indeed', 'greatest', 'strength', 'how', 'seemlessly', 'story', 'told', 'how', 'compliment', 'overarching', 'plot', 'episode', 'Cracker', 'as', 'good', 'television', 'season', 'two', 'very', 'best', 'great', 'series']",N/A
788713,A1A71FUA46JTOY,B0000X2EU6,ric03,"[1, 1]","This review is about the episode 'To Be Somebody', which is available separately in the UK. I first watched this when it aired in 1994. It was the first episode of Cracker I watched and I thought it was fantastic. I was only 20. Add the best part of 15 years and I've finally watched it again... So now what do I make of it?I'm surprised I didn't come back to this sooner. Coltrane is perfect as Fitz. Many have tried to play the angry, hard-drinking detective but nobody comes within a country mile of this acid-tongued colossus. He is hilarious at times, genius, tragic and brutal at others. A chain-smoking, workaholic, alocoholic, womanizer who also likes an 'occasional' flutter. Add to that, the utterly convincing performance of Robert Carlyle as psychotic skin headed killer, Albie Kinsella; the beautiful and poignant writing of Jimmy McGovern; and a rock-solid supporting cast (including a great Christopher Eccleston, Ricky Tomlinson and sultry Geraldine Somerville as `Panhandle') and it is pretty incomparable.If you like crime dramas and haven't seen Cracker, get this episode, you'll probably buy the boxset.
