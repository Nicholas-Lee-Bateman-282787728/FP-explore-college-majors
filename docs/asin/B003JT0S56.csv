1347829,A2582KMXLK2P06,B003JT0S56,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","True story- I wanted to review Fear Island in December of 2011 after my furnace suddenly stopped working in the middle of watching this movie, but I sort of got distracted with that and, if I recall, this movie strangely wasn't available on amazon at the time.  Or perhaps the search results couldn't find it.  Either way, I haven't been able to review it until now.The truth is, without Haylie Duff's character, I would have lowered the rating to 2 stars.  Basically the only thing that differentiates this film from the countless other teen slashers is that, throughout the movie, Haylie spends her time in an police interrogation room trying to explain what really happened during an island vacation where her friends were all murdered.  She contradicts herself a lot while here making the cops suspicious, and goes through several traumatic experiences whenever the film turns its attention to this portion of the plot.  I like the idea of combining this segment with the actual storyline showing the teens on the island, even though it gives away what happened to all the teens.  We see teenagers being killed one by one in ways that are probably mediocre by today's standards since the same kind of thing has already been done countless times, even 10 years ago.It's really all about Haylie Duff's decent acting abilities saving this one.  Without that, well, this film wouldn't have been nearly as compelling in my opinion.  Some of the murders involve hangings and drownings, searching for a little dog, a little suspicious toy that spins around on the deck stairs of the place the teens are staying in, etc.  However there's one contradicting element to the story but I can't mention it or I'll unintentionally spoil who the murderer is.  It involves this toy spinning on the deck and the word ""Innocent"" painted on the front door.  Given the circumstances, let's just say, this particular segment *can't* make sense and is therefore a storyline inconsistency because the murderer wasn't even around this area at the time.  Unless you can wind up a toy and it begins to spin a couple minutes later just as the teens come back?  Nah...Either way, Fear Island is a decent horror movie but we've seen the same exact idea several times already.  Decent acting by everyone, but a story we've already seen.",3,not the ideal vacation spot,1384041600,"11 10, 2013",2013,2309,"['True', 'story-', 'wanted', 'review', 'Fear', 'Island', 'December', '2011', 'furnace', 'suddenly', 'stopped', 'working', 'middle', 'watching', 'movie', 'sort', 'got', 'distracted', 'recall', 'movie', 'strangely', 'was', ""n't"", 'available', 'amazon', 'time', 'perhaps', 'search', 'results', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'way', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'review', 'now.The', 'truth', 'Haylie', 'Duff', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'lowered', 'rating', '2', 'stars', 'Basically', 'only', 'thing', 'film', 'countless', 'other', 'teen', 'slashers', 'movie', 'Haylie', 'time', 'police', 'interrogation', 'room', 'trying', 'explain', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'island', 'vacation', 'where', 'friends', 'were', 'murdered', 'lot', 'here', 'making', 'cops', 'suspicious', 'several', 'traumatic', 'experiences', 'whenever', 'film', 'attention', 'portion', 'plot', 'like', 'idea', 'combining', 'segment', 'actual', 'storyline', 'showing', 'teens', 'island', 'even', 'away', 'what', 'happened', 'teens', 'see', 'teenagers', 'being', 'killed', 'one', 'one', 'ways', 'are', 'probably', 'mediocre', 'today', 'standards', 'same', 'kind', 'thing', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'countless', 'times', 'even', '10', 'years', 'ago.It', 'really', 'Haylie', 'Duff', 'decent', 'acting', 'abilities', 'saving', 'one', 'well', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'nearly', 'compelling', 'opinion', 'murders', 'involve', 'hangings', 'drownings', 'searching', 'little', 'dog', 'little', 'suspicious', 'toy', 'deck', 'stairs', 'place', 'teens', 'are', 'staying', 'etc', 'However', 'one', 'contradicting', 'element', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'mention', ""'ll"", 'unintentionally', 'spoil', 'who', 'murderer', 'toy', 'spinning', 'deck', 'word', 'Innocent', 'painted', 'front', 'door', 'Given', 'circumstances', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'particular', 'segment', ""*can't*"", 'make', 'sense', 'therefore', 'storyline', 'inconsistency', 'murderer', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'area', 'time', 'can', 'wind', 'up', 'toy', 'spin', 'couple', 'minutes', 'later', 'just', 'teens', 'come', 'back', 'Nah', 'way', 'Fear', 'Island', 'decent', 'horror', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'same', 'exact', 'idea', 'several', 'times', 'already', 'Decent', 'acting', 'everyone', 'story', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen']",N/A

1347831,A19L14G82I6SEE,B003JT0S56,"Kat ""Reviewer @ Shivers Of Horror""","[6, 7]","I have to be honest, I saw this on my cable TV's on demand. I didn't purchase the DVD. But seeing as how there are no reviews for this here, I thought I'd post my opinion on this movie.The movie starts out at the end of all the murders. We see on survivor and are told everyone is dead. I hate when that happens in movies because then I know who survives and that everyone else is gonna bite it. It honestly wasn't that big of a deal with this movie though.The survivor can't remember anything, and its through them that we find out what happened on this island that they were vacationing on with their friends.The movie is pretty straight forward other then not knowing who the killer is. It really tries to twist everything around a time or two so that it throws you off the scent of the real killer. And for me it did that. I had no idea who or why until a little while before it was revealed. I honestly enjoyed the ending of the film and all the ""twists"" thrown at the viewer. I really thought they were going to go a completely different angle. I do like it when movies keep me guessing, but not too much cause then it can get confusing!However, the movie also had its faults. Mainly I just didn't care much about the characters. They were all likable to some extent. But I would have liked to see them hanging out more together doing stuff having fun and get to know and like them so that when their demise took place, I'd feel something. But no, it wasn't meant to be. Instead they were all a little flat. The one I cared the most about was the one I was probably supposed to not like, go figure.There was no nudity, and not much for gore.A few of the actors I recognized from other things so that was nice. Like Lucy Hale from Pretty Little Liars/Scream 4. The main guy who plays Mark (Aaron Ashmore) I could have sworn was in Xmen. I checked IMDB only to find out that it wasn't him, but his twin. Wow, learn something new every day.In the end I enjoyed the movie for what it was. But it didn't feel all that ""horrific"". So much more could have been done with it to make it really good. Instead it felt more like a made for TV film with a swear here and there. Its definitely watchable and entertaining, but nothing to get blown away by.Feel free to check out my blog Shivers of Horror (link in my profile) for a more in depth review on this movie along with many many other horror movie/book reviews.",3,"Decent, but felt like a TV movie",1340064000,"06 19, 2012",2012,2411,"['have', 'be', 'honest', 'saw', 'cable', 'TV', 'demand', 'did', ""n't"", 'purchase', 'DVD', 'seeing', 'how', 'are', 'reviews', 'here', 'thought', ""'d"", 'post', 'opinion', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'out', 'end', 'murders', 'see', 'survivor', 'are', 'told', 'everyone', 'dead', 'hate', 'when', 'movies', 'then', 'know', 'who', 'everyone', 'else', 'gon', 'bite', 'honestly', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'deal', 'movie', 'though.The', 'survivor', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'anything', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'island', 'were', 'vacationing', 'friends.The', 'movie', 'pretty', 'straight', 'forward', 'other', 'then', 'not', 'knowing', 'who', 'killer', 'really', 'twist', 'everything', 'time', 'two', 'off', 'scent', 'real', 'killer', 'did', 'had', 'idea', 'who', 'why', 'little', 'was', 'revealed', 'honestly', 'enjoyed', 'ending', 'film', 'twists', 'thrown', 'viewer', 'really', 'thought', 'were', 'going', 'go', 'completely', 'different', 'angle', 'do', 'when', 'movies', 'keep', 'guessing', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'cause', 'then', 'can', 'get', 'confusing', 'However', 'movie', 'also', 'had', 'faults', 'Mainly', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'characters', 'were', 'likable', 'extent', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'hanging', 'out', 'more', 'together', 'doing', 'stuff', 'having', 'fun', 'get', 'know', 'like', 'so', 'when', 'demise', 'took', 'place', ""'d"", 'feel', 'something', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'Instead', 'were', 'little', 'flat', 'one', 'cared', 'most', 'was', 'one', 'was', 'probably', 'supposed', 'not', 'like', 'go', 'figure.There', 'was', 'nudity', 'not', 'much', 'gore.A', 'few', 'actors', 'recognized', 'other', 'things', 'was', 'nice', 'Lucy', 'Hale', 'Pretty', 'Little', 'Liars/Scream', '4', 'main', 'guy', 'who', 'Mark', 'Aaron', 'Ashmore', 'could', 'have', 'sworn', 'was', 'Xmen', 'checked', 'IMDB', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'twin', 'Wow', 'learn', 'something', 'new', 'day.In', 'end', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'what', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'horrific', 'So', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'make', 'really', 'good', 'Instead', 'felt', 'more', 'made', 'TV', 'film', 'swear', 'here', 'there', 'definitely', 'watchable', 'entertaining', 'nothing', 'get', 'blown', 'away', 'by.Feel', 'free', 'check', 'out', 'blog', 'Shivers', 'Horror', 'link', 'profile', 'more', 'depth', 'review', 'movie', 'many', 'many', 'other', 'horror', 'movie/book', 'reviews']",N/A

1347834,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B003JT0S56,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Fear Island (Michael Story, 2009)IMDB informs me that Fear Island is a made-for-TV film, though they neglect, as usual, to tell me on which station it initially aired. I'm going to take a stab at the Lifetime Movie Network; it's got that feel to it, and it fits with a few of cinematographer Storey's other directorial efforts (Before I Say Goodbye and We'll Meet Again, both part of &#8220;The Mary Higgins Clark&#8221; collection&#8212;though as far as I can tell Ms. Clark had not a blessed thing to do with either). But don't let that feel you into thinking I'm coming down on this monstrosity because I think it's a Lifetime Original Movie&#8212;I thought it sucked while I was watching it, days before I discovered it was a made-for-TV affair. Once again, Hillary Duff's older, somewhat less talented sister Haylie got herself a cinematic vehicle, and once again (just in case you missed it, I reviewed Backwoods, which came out the year before, a ways back, with similar results) it's terrible. And I say this as someone who doesn't have anything against the Duff clan in general; Raise Your Voice is one of those guilty-pleasure movies I can't help but watch every time I stumble across it. Fear Island has no chance of getting to that level.Plot: the usual crop of young-and-beautifuls heads off for a weekend of partying at the island retreat of (presumably, the parents of) Tyler Campbell (A History of Violence's Kyle Schmid) and his brothers Mark (The Shrine's Aaron Ashmore) and Kyle (The Grey's Jacob Blair). Along for the ride: Mark's ex-girlfriend Jenna (Duff), who went on the promise that Mark would not be attending and isn't happy he's along for the ride, Tyler's current girlfriend Ashley (Jessica Harmon from the 2006 remake of Black Christmas), and Megan (Scream 4's Lucy Hale), a mysterious stowaway on the gang's boat who is accepted quickly by the males in the group thanks to her let's-party attitude. The first night goes off relatively without a hitch, but weird things have been happening their entire time there, and as the sun dawns on their second day, the weird factor turns dangerous. Oh, I should mention there's a frame story: As we open, Jenna is in the hospital, the lone survivor of the weekend. Detective Amory (Love Come Down's Martin Cummins) figures Jenna killed everyone else; beautiful-brilliant-stereotypical-psychologist Dr. Chalice (The Thaw's Anne Marie Deluise) believes Jenna's protestations of innocence (and amnesia). The main story is told in flashback, with punctuation scenes of the detective wanting to just shoot her and the doctor trying to get to the bottom of things......and you've see it all before, at least a dozen times, always done better than this. I'll give screenwriters Jeff Martel (A Fairy Tale Christmas) and Jack Harry (this is the only writing credit he has at IMDB as of this writing) two things: they have a propensity for coming up with good character names (you'll get what I mean, if you are unlucky enough to see this movie, given the demise of one of the characters) and the one piece of the plot that never quite rings true is handled with much more skill than anything else here&#8212;one assumes, in fact, that was the &#8220;what if...?&#8221; that started the script being written in the first place. Had they handled the rest of it with such care, they might have gotten somewhere&#8212;though granted they probably would have needed a casting director who would have resisted casting Haylie Duff. *",1,Guess which sister got all the talent in THIS family?,1383436800,"11 3, 2013",2013,3489,"['Fear', 'Island', 'Michael', 'Story', '2009', 'IMDB', 'informs', 'Fear', 'Island', 'made-for-TV', 'film', 'neglect', 'usual', 'tell', 'station', 'initially', 'aired', ""'m"", 'going', 'take', 'stab', 'Lifetime', 'Movie', 'Network', 'got', 'feel', 'few', 'cinematographer', 'Storey', 'other', 'directorial', 'efforts', 'Say', 'Goodbye', ""'ll"", 'Meet', 'Again', 'part', '8220', 'Mary', 'Higgins', 'Clark', '8221', 'collection', '8212', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'Ms.', 'Clark', 'had', 'not', 'blessed', 'thing', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'feel', 'thinking', ""'m"", 'coming', 'down', 'monstrosity', 'think', 'Lifetime', 'Original', 'Movie', '8212', 'thought', 'sucked', 'was', 'watching', 'days', 'discovered', 'was', 'made-for-TV', 'affair', 'Once', 'again', 'Hillary', 'Duff', 'older', 'somewhat', 'less', 'talented', 'sister', 'Haylie', 'got', 'cinematic', 'vehicle', 'once', 'again', 'just', 'case', 'missed', 'reviewed', 'Backwoods', 'came', 'out', 'year', 'before', 'ways', 'back', 'similar', 'results', 'terrible', 'say', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'Duff', 'clan', 'general', 'Raise', 'Voice', 'one', 'guilty-pleasure', 'movies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'watch', 'time', 'stumble', 'Fear', 'Island', 'chance', 'getting', 'level.Plot', 'usual', 'crop', 'young-and-beautifuls', 'heads', 'off', 'weekend', 'partying', 'island', 'retreat', 'presumably', 'parents', 'Tyler', 'Campbell', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'Kyle', 'Schmid', 'brothers', 'Mark', 'Shrine', 'Aaron', 'Ashmore', 'Kyle', 'Grey', 'Jacob', 'Blair', 'ride', 'Mark', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Jenna', 'Duff', 'who', 'went', 'promise', 'Mark', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'attending', ""n't"", 'happy', 'along', 'ride', 'Tyler', 'current', 'girlfriend', 'Ashley', 'Jessica', 'Harmon', '2006', 'remake', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'Megan', 'Scream', '4', 'Lucy', 'Hale', 'mysterious', 'stowaway', 'gang', 'boat', 'who', 'accepted', 'quickly', 'males', 'group', ""let's-party"", 'attitude', 'first', 'night', 'off', 'relatively', 'hitch', 'weird', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'happening', 'entire', 'time', 'there', 'sun', 'dawns', 'second', 'day', 'weird', 'factor', 'dangerous', 'Oh', 'should', 'mention', 'frame', 'story', 'open', 'Jenna', 'hospital', 'lone', 'survivor', 'weekend', 'Detective', 'Amory', 'Love', 'Come', 'Down', 'Martin', 'Cummins', 'Jenna', 'killed', 'everyone', 'else', 'beautiful-brilliant-stereotypical-psychologist', 'Dr.', 'Chalice', 'Thaw', 'Anne', 'Marie', 'Deluise', 'Jenna', 'protestations', 'innocence', 'amnesia', 'main', 'story', 'told', 'flashback', 'punctuation', 'scenes', 'detective', 'wanting', 'just', 'shoot', 'doctor', 'trying', 'get', 'bottom', 'things', ""'ve"", 'see', 'least', 'dozen', 'times', 'always', 'done', 'better', ""'ll"", 'give', 'screenwriters', 'Jeff', 'Martel', 'A', 'Fairy', 'Tale', 'Christmas', 'Jack', 'Harry', 'only', 'writing', 'credit', 'IMDB', 'writing', 'two', 'things', 'have', 'propensity', 'coming', 'up', 'good', 'character', 'names', ""'ll"", 'get', 'what', 'mean', 'are', 'unlucky', 'enough', 'see', 'movie', 'given', 'demise', 'one', 'characters', 'one', 'piece', 'plot', 'never', 'quite', 'rings', 'true', 'handled', 'much', 'more', 'skill', 'anything', 'else', 'here', '8212', 'one', 'fact', 'was', '8220', 'what', '8221', 'started', 'script', 'being', 'written', 'first', 'place', 'Had', 'handled', 'rest', 'such', 'care', 'might', 'have', 'gotten', 'somewhere', '8212', 'granted', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'needed', 'casting', 'director', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'resisted', 'casting', 'Haylie', 'Duff', '*']",N/A
