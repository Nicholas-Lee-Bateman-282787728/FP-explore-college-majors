796119,A2ZSC81MXLBELX,B00018YCJG,"L. Shirley ""Laurie's Boomer Views""","[65, 65]","This review refers to the 3rd Season of Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman (DVD set/A&E;)...I hardly have to tell anyone, that is already shopping for Season Three, that this series is one of the best TV has to offer. You are already familiar and attached to the town of Colorado Springs, and the wonderful characters we have come to know and love. We know the history of the growing bonds and relationships that have already touched us, and maybe even feel a part of it by now. This makes this season all the more special.Here's a taste of what you have to look foward to. ""The Train"" is coming to Colorado Springs, and has the town divided. A ""Cattle Drive"", has Dr. Mike's family and Loren mourning the death of Miss Olive, and herding her cattle, now left to Matthew, back to town. There are some great holiday episodes to enjoy, a trip to Washington D.C. to try to help the Cheyenne, and Dorothy's scare with breast cancer (""Ladies Night""/2 parts) mixes high drama with comic relief as Jake, dressed up as a woman is taken hostage. Sully becomes and ""Indian Agent"", the kids Father returns to try and take them back in ""Cooper Vs. Quinn"", and Mike stirs up the town with her teachings of the evolution theory in ""The Permanence of Change."" Then just when you think things could not get any more emotional, the double episode of ""Washita"", will have you in tears as the story of the massacre of the Cheyenne tribe we have come to love, unfolds. Mike and Sully must both deal with the horror of what has happened in their own ways.The last disc has two episodes, that will have you laughing, smiling and crying. Mike and Sully get ready to tie the knot. The Reverend tries to council them on what to expect in ""Ready or Not"", and we see some wonderful flashbacks of the growing love these two share. And then finally ""For Better Or Worse"". The feature length wedding episode, that has Mike torn between her family's wedding plans and the townsfolk. On the more serious end, Custer is out to get Cloud Dancing, and Sully tries to protect his good friend. The wedding, a beautiful event, will at the very least, have you all choked up, and brings back the return of a few favorites from other episodes and even Hank and Jake become unlikely heroes. The closing scene is just too beautiful for words.There are 25(including the 2 parters) of these moving episodes on 8 discs, and added to the fabulous regular cast, you'll see some great guest stars. Elinor Donahue, Johnny and June Carter Cash, and Richard Bull among them. The part of Colleen changes about mid-stream from Erika Flores to Jessica Bowman. although just when you get used to the new Colleen, Flores returns for just one episode, and then back to Bowman again. The discs as before, are all in their own keep cases, present a nice picture with good clarity and excellent sound. Disc 8 has commentary from Jane Seymour and Joe Lando which may be listened to during ""For Better or Worse"". The buying info here says there are highlights, I could not locate these anywhere. The scene selection is nice and there is a summary of each episode on the discs. And A&E..STILL; no captions for hearing impaired viewers to enjoy this wonderful series...why not? So still 4 stars for this 5 plus star show.These sets, viewed season by season are a great investment, as you are sure to view them over and over. But..the price is pretty high, so check the outside sellers for some really good deals.They don't make em like this anymore..a wonderful mix of adventure, history, and romance, all told in a way that makes us fall in love with the whole town, and makes for excellent family entertainment.Enjoy...Laurie",4,"The Washita Massacre, The Wedding,  and Colleen Redux",1107907200,"02 9, 2005",2005,3653,"['review', '3rd', 'Season', 'Dr.', 'Quinn', 'Medicine', 'Woman', 'DVD', 'set/A', 'E', 'hardly', 'have', 'tell', 'anyone', 'already', 'shopping', 'Season', 'Three', 'series', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'offer', 'are', 'already', 'familiar', 'attached', 'town', 'Colorado', 'Springs', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'love', 'know', 'history', 'growing', 'bonds', 'relationships', 'have', 'already', 'touched', 'maybe', 'even', 'feel', 'part', 'now', 'season', 'more', 'taste', 'what', 'have', 'look', 'foward', 'Train', 'coming', 'Colorado', 'Springs', 'town', 'divided', 'Cattle', 'Drive', 'Dr.', 'Mike', 'family', 'Loren', 'mourning', 'death', 'Miss', 'Olive', 'herding', 'cattle', 'now', 'Matthew', 'back', 'town', 'are', 'great', 'holiday', 'episodes', 'enjoy', 'trip', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'try', 'help', 'Cheyenne', 'Dorothy', 'scare', 'breast', 'cancer', 'Ladies', 'Night', '/2', 'parts', 'mixes', 'high', 'drama', 'comic', 'relief', 'Jake', 'dressed', 'up', 'woman', 'taken', 'hostage', 'Sully', 'Indian', 'Agent', 'kids', 'Father', 'returns', 'try', 'take', 'back', 'Cooper', 'Vs.', 'Quinn', 'Mike', 'up', 'town', 'teachings', 'evolution', 'theory', 'Permanence', 'Change', 'Then', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'things', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'more', 'emotional', 'double', 'episode', 'Washita', 'will', 'have', 'tears', 'story', 'massacre', 'Cheyenne', 'tribe', 'have', 'come', 'love', 'unfolds', 'Mike', 'Sully', 'must', 'deal', 'horror', 'what', 'happened', 'own', 'ways.The', 'last', 'disc', 'two', 'episodes', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'smiling', 'crying', 'Mike', 'Sully', 'get', 'ready', 'tie', 'knot', 'Reverend', 'council', 'what', 'expect', 'Ready', 'Not', 'see', 'wonderful', 'flashbacks', 'growing', 'two', 'share', 'then', 'finally', 'Better', 'Or', 'Worse', 'feature', 'length', 'wedding', 'episode', 'Mike', 'torn', 'family', 'wedding', 'plans', 'townsfolk', 'more', 'serious', 'end', 'Custer', 'out', 'get', 'Cloud', 'Dancing', 'Sully', 'tries', 'protect', 'good', 'friend', 'wedding', 'beautiful', 'event', 'will', 'very', 'least', 'have', 'choked', 'up', 'back', 'return', 'few', 'favorites', 'other', 'episodes', 'even', 'Hank', 'Jake', 'become', 'unlikely', 'heroes', 'closing', 'scene', 'just', 'too', 'beautiful', 'are', '25', 'including', '2', 'parters', 'moving', 'episodes', '8', 'discs', 'added', 'fabulous', 'regular', 'cast', ""'ll"", 'see', 'great', 'guest', 'stars', 'Elinor', 'Donahue', 'Johnny', 'June', 'Carter', 'Cash', 'Richard', 'Bull', 'part', 'Colleen', 'changes', 'mid-stream', 'Erika', 'Flores', 'Jessica', 'Bowman', 'just', 'when', 'get', 'used', 'new', 'Colleen', 'Flores', 'just', 'one', 'episode', 'then', 'back', 'Bowman', 'again', 'discs', 'are', 'own', 'keep', 'cases', 'present', 'nice', 'picture', 'good', 'clarity', 'excellent', 'sound', 'Disc', '8', 'commentary', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'Joe', 'Lando', 'may', 'be', 'listened', 'Better', 'Worse', 'buying', 'info', 'here', 'are', 'highlights', 'could', 'not', 'locate', 'anywhere', 'scene', 'selection', 'nice', 'summary', 'episode', 'discs', 'A', 'E..STILL', 'captions', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'viewers', 'enjoy', 'wonderful', 'series', 'why', 'not', 'So', 'still', '4', 'stars', '5', 'star', 'show.These', 'sets', 'viewed', 'season', 'season', 'are', 'great', 'investment', 'are', 'sure', 'view', 'over', 'over', 'But..the', 'price', 'pretty', 'high', 'so', 'check', 'outside', 'sellers', 'really', 'good', 'deals.They', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'em', 'anymore..a', 'wonderful', 'mix', 'adventure', 'history', 'romance', 'told', 'way', 'fall', 'love', 'whole', 'town', 'excellent', 'family', 'entertainment.Enjoy', 'Laurie']",N/A

I've bought the complete set of ""Dr Quinn"" DVDs, including the movies.  It's nice TV that's well scripted, well acted, has beautiful cinematography, nice music and always has a good message that's conveyed in a gentle, but effective manner.  What more could you ask for?!The only downside is the lack of special features.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed listening to Joe Lando and Jane Seymour comment on the wedding episode. However it would have been nice to have seen Joe and Jane interviewed together, talking about the show.  The creators of the ""Remington Steele"" DVDs (which I also own) have done a very good job in that respect by getting all of the major cast members to speak about the show.  I seem to recall that there was a TV special about the making of ""Dr Quinn"" that was screened during the same period that that the show was being aired on TV.  I think that the special was made during the filming of either Season 1 or Season 2.
