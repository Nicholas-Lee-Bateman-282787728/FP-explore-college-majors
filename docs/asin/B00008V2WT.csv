Most all of these films have been in b&w;, but I have not seen a feature length documentary of this quality devoted solely to color film.I was skeptical as to the merits of the film since only a small percentage of W.W.II film was in color.  However, the PBS producers out did themselves in achieving a superb documentary.  The main fault with the film was the occasional disjointed telling of the story so that the film could continue with only color footage.  However, the overall effect was compelling enough to forgive these infrequent intrusions.What makes this documentary unique from the very few other color-documentaries is the producers finding so many home made films by soldiers' families.  This brought the story to a more intimate level than many other such films.  Also, I became emotional in listening to many of the letters written by soldiers and their loved ones.  In one particular case, a marine officer writes eloquently to his very young children to speak about himself in case he should not return to them.  All the while, the viewer watches home movies of this marine with his infants and his wife.  We then learn that the marine died in action.  If that scene alone is not worth supporting the viewing of this film, then you've got very cold blood in your veins.The World at War series (filmed in b&w;) is still the best overall documentary of this subject (especially the dvd version with the extra features).  However, Perilous Fight is a must have dvd and it would go far to better educate our children about the war, and the troubled period of this nations history when the war was fought.  That is not to degrade the b&w; films, but I really noticed things in Perilous Fight footage that I can't always say were as obvious in b&w; versions.  For example, the sometimes beauty of the scenery in which some of the bloody battles were fought.Finally, for those who oppose this film because of the narrator, I guess the overused phrase ""Get over it"" comes to mind.  My father was a W.W.II vet and I'm sure that he would have loved to have seen this film.  Can you imagine not watching the Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston, or The Searchers with John Wayne just because you didn't like their political views?  That kind of criticism is beyond odd, it's just plain childish logic.  Besides, if one were to attribute politics to the narrator of this documentary, then one could only conclude that the narrator is highly patriotic and holds great empathy for the W.W.II vet since that is the message from this film.P.s., there is much footage of dead, severely wounded, and dismembered bodies including Americans.  The viewer should exercise careful judgment about allowing pre-teens to see the whole of this film.",5,"More than the color film, it's a great story.",1115683200,"05 10, 2005",2005,2845,"['decades', 'have', 'watched', 'hundreds', 'perhaps', 'thousands', 'hours', 'documentary', 'film', 'W.W.II', 'Most', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'b', 'w', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'feature', 'length', 'documentary', 'quality', 'devoted', 'solely', 'color', 'film.I', 'was', 'skeptical', 'merits', 'film', 'only', 'small', 'percentage', 'W.W.II', 'film', 'was', 'color', 'However', 'PBS', 'producers', 'out', 'did', 'achieving', 'superb', 'documentary', 'main', 'fault', 'film', 'was', 'occasional', 'disjointed', 'telling', 'story', 'so', 'film', 'could', 'continue', 'only', 'color', 'footage', 'However', 'overall', 'effect', 'was', 'compelling', 'enough', 'forgive', 'infrequent', 'intrusions.What', 'documentary', 'unique', 'very', 'few', 'other', 'color-documentaries', 'producers', 'finding', 'so', 'many', 'home', 'made', 'films', 'soldiers', 'families', 'brought', 'story', 'more', 'intimate', 'level', 'many', 'other', 'such', 'films', 'Also', 'became', 'emotional', 'listening', 'many', 'letters', 'written', 'soldiers', 'loved', 'ones', 'one', 'particular', 'case', 'marine', 'officer', 'eloquently', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'speak', 'case', 'should', 'not', 'return', 'while', 'viewer', 'home', 'movies', 'marine', 'infants', 'wife', 'then', 'learn', 'marine', 'died', 'action', 'scene', 'alone', 'not', 'worth', 'supporting', 'viewing', 'film', 'then', ""'ve"", 'got', 'very', 'cold', 'blood', 'veins.The', 'World', 'War', 'series', 'filmed', 'b', 'w', 'still', 'best', 'overall', 'documentary', 'subject', 'especially', 'dvd', 'version', 'extra', 'features', 'However', 'Perilous', 'Fight', 'must', 'have', 'dvd', 'would', 'go', 'far', 'better', 'educate', 'children', 'war', 'troubled', 'period', 'nations', 'history', 'when', 'war', 'was', 'fought', 'not', 'degrade', 'b', 'w', 'films', 'really', 'noticed', 'things', 'Perilous', 'Fight', 'footage', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'say', 'were', 'as', 'obvious', 'b', 'w', 'versions', 'example', 'sometimes', 'beauty', 'scenery', 'bloody', 'battles', 'were', 'fought.Finally', 'who', 'oppose', 'film', 'narrator', 'guess', 'overused', 'phrase', 'Get', 'mind', 'father', 'was', 'W.W.II', 'vet', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'Can', 'imagine', 'not', 'watching', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Searchers', 'John', 'Wayne', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'political', 'views', 'kind', 'criticism', 'odd', 'just', 'plain', 'childish', 'logic', 'one', 'were', 'attribute', 'politics', 'narrator', 'documentary', 'then', 'one', 'could', 'only', 'conclude', 'narrator', 'highly', 'patriotic', 'great', 'empathy', 'W.W.II', 'vet', 'message', 'film.P.s.', 'much', 'footage', 'dead', 'severely', 'wounded', 'dismembered', 'bodies', 'including', 'Americans', 'viewer', 'should', 'exercise', 'careful', 'judgment', 'allowing', 'pre-teens', 'see', 'whole', 'film']",The Perilous Fight - America's World War II in Color

The footage showing wartime USA is very interesting. People look real here because they were.

Amateurs in the United States shot a great deal of the video; but there is also some actual combat footage of the African, European and Pacific theaters. Narrated by Martin Sheen, the situation in the United States before it entered the war is also covered. Extremely isolationist in sentiment, the public mood was basically to let the supposed barriers of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans keep the U. S. out of the war. That false premise and complacency was shattered when the Japanese were able to launch their attack against Pearl Harbor, an event that made even the most reluctant person realize that the Atlantic and Pacific oceans were no longer a significant barrier to attack.The dark side of the internment of Japanese-Americans is also covered as well as the dramatic changes that took place in American society. For the first time, millions of women joined the labor force doing factory style work and blacks demonstrated that they could and would fight as hard as any other group. Once the war ended with victory, it was impossible to roll back those gains, although it took several years before they were solidified and codified.The American people that lived through the depression and won World War II were without question the ""greatest generation.""

Ortiz ""Explorer and Academic""","[5, 5]","From original color film footage comes this new 4 part video, narrated by Martin Sheen, and re-telling the stories of many actual participants in the war, especially from the American point-of-view. I dont care if Martin Sheen may be opposed to war in general. think,,, Most americans at the time were opposed to war! Until we got attacked ourselves... Then we entered and fought hard, to defend the world. Make no mistakes about it WW2 times were not psycologically confused or ambigous times for the americans, we knew exactly who the good guys were and who the bad guys were. This was no vietnam or iraq. Hitler's evil forces killed thousands in death camps and attacked us on the battlefields... This film shows these stories and tells them in such a way that is understanding, respectful, and done with honor to the allies. The Perilous fight is the one world war two documentary to have in your collection that you can show in school, that you can watch with a loved one, and to watch to truly remember the sacrifice that the allies made against an axis of evil in the 1940's... This film is done with reverence, and with great tidbits of factual details showing the changing times and civil rights battles that also occured during the era. I love the perilous fight, and Martin Sheen is a great narrator for this film, I could not think of a better narrator at all.

Historical documentories are usually in Black and White so that the people look like relics from history.  Color changes everything.  I think this is a rather good collection of clips that tells a great story.  It does not gloss over racism and bigotry that existed in America and the in the Military, it shows our triumph in spite of those things.The fact that Martin Sheen narrates enhances the experience for me rather than detracts.  He is a good actor, who knows how to tell a good story.  This is America, after all, and one is entitled to make a living regardless of his or her politics.  Isn't that what WWII was about?This film gives an interesting and sometimes painful view of our country's greatest effort--the defeat of Facism.
