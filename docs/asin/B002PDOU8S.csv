1282890,A28RREP03HJZGU,B002PDOU8S,a reader,"[1, 1]","Love this DVD.  The workout is easy to follow for an out of shape beginner like me.  The food and diet advice is pretty familiar and sound. Easy to follow instructions, no complicated foot work or movements that may throw out your back or pull a muscle.  I highly recommend it for those who haven't exercised in a long while.",5,Bob Greene: Total Body Makeover,1304553600,"05 5, 2011",2011,325,"['Love', 'DVD', 'workout', 'easy', 'follow', 'out', 'shape', 'beginner', 'food', 'diet', 'advice', 'pretty', 'familiar', 'sound', 'Easy', 'follow', 'instructions', 'complicated', 'foot', 'work', 'movements', 'may', 'throw', 'out', 'back', 'pull', 'muscle', 'highly', 'recommend', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'exercised', 'long', 'while']",N/A

1282892,A82FTHEZ4W8TU,B002PDOU8S,Overcomer,"[1, 1]","Despite all the negative reviews I decided to purchase this DVD and I am so glad that I did.  I do agree with some of the comments, namely that the camera is focused too much on Bob and not the person doing the exercise and also poor cueing.  That being said, this is a top notch workout DVD from one of the best in the business.  Bob Green has been around for a long time and in my book, experience does have some advantages.  The DVD has eight separate workouts that are short but effective and incorporates all 3 areas of a good workout, strength, flexibility and balance.  The exercises range between 10-20 minutes each. This is especially helpful for someone with a busy schedule who needs a quick but effective workout in the mornings before work or evenings after work. The exercises are progressive which makes it adaptable for beginners through advanced. There are some traditional lunges but also plenty of new moves which keeps the workouts interesting.  There is also plenty of variety which keeps the muscles guessing as muscles tend to adapt if you do the same repetitive exercises every day.  There is also a feature in the DVD that allows you to customize your routine by combining a group of exercises.  Included as a bonus is a booklet and a brief video session about food and nutrition and the role this plays in weight management.  Finally, there are also brief tid bits that Bob recites before each workout which provide inspiration and encouragement.  The DVD is not perfect. I recommend watching in its entirety the specic workout the day before doing the workout to compensate for some of the bad photography and cueing.  Overall, however, the benefits of this DVD far outweigh the cons.  Given the expertise, variety and adaptability, this is an exceptional workout DVD and a valuable addition to any exercise video library.  I hope that Bob will do another workout DVD soon.",4,"Great workout, exceptional value",1327190400,"01 22, 2012",2012,1900,"['negative', 'reviews', 'decided', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'did', 'do', 'agree', 'comments', 'namely', 'camera', 'focused', 'too', 'much', 'Bob', 'not', 'person', 'doing', 'exercise', 'also', 'poor', 'cueing', 'being', 'said', 'top', 'notch', 'workout', 'DVD', 'one', 'best', 'business', 'Bob', 'Green', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'book', 'experience', 'have', 'advantages', 'DVD', 'eight', 'separate', 'workouts', 'are', 'short', 'effective', '3', 'areas', 'good', 'workout', 'strength', 'flexibility', 'balance', 'exercises', 'range', '10-20', 'minutes', 'especially', 'helpful', 'someone', 'busy', 'schedule', 'who', 'quick', 'effective', 'workout', 'mornings', 'work', 'evenings', 'work', 'exercises', 'are', 'progressive', 'adaptable', 'beginners', 'advanced', 'are', 'traditional', 'lunges', 'also', 'plenty', 'new', 'moves', 'keeps', 'workouts', 'interesting', 'also', 'plenty', 'variety', 'muscles', 'guessing', 'muscles', 'tend', 'adapt', 'do', 'same', 'repetitive', 'exercises', 'day', 'also', 'feature', 'DVD', 'customize', 'routine', 'combining', 'group', 'exercises', 'Included', 'bonus', 'booklet', 'brief', 'video', 'session', 'food', 'nutrition', 'role', 'weight', 'management', 'Finally', 'are', 'also', 'brief', 'tid', 'bits', 'Bob', 'workout', 'provide', 'inspiration', 'encouragement', 'DVD', 'not', 'perfect', 'recommend', 'watching', 'entirety', 'specic', 'day', 'doing', 'workout', 'compensate', 'bad', 'photography', 'cueing', 'Overall', 'however', 'benefits', 'DVD', 'far', 'outweigh', 'cons', 'Given', 'expertise', 'variety', 'adaptability', 'exceptional', 'workout', 'DVD', 'valuable', 'addition', 'exercise', 'video', 'library', 'hope', 'Bob', 'will', 'do', 'workout', 'DVD', 'soon']",N/A
1282893,AV9KHF8A9O5PD,B002PDOU8S,Steven Graham,"[0, 1]","My sister sent me the DVD after she began Bob's program and liked it.  I was recovering from a successful ablation for A Fib, and just lost 20 extra pounds.  I was doing pilates and riding my bike, but I needed something for the limbs.  I have the same complaint as others, that the camera is on Bob too much of the time, but the workouts are useful and in good order to tone your arms, legs and abs.  I didn't always progress at the weekly schedule.  If I felt I needed more time on a certain week, I'd repeat it until I was ready to move on.  It really takes more time to really master the exercises and achieve good technique, so I went back and reviewed all the weeks after I had completed the program.  What I ended up doing, is performing weeks 7 and 8 consecutively (about a 45 minute workout) after my pilates workout (another 35 minutes), and I do this at least three times a week.  In combination with mountain hiking twice a week, I'm in the best shape I've been in for a decade.  The program is going to make you more functional and able to enjoy things like playing with your kids or grandkids instead of only being able to watch.  You'll find that the little aches and pains slowly disappear, and getting up in the morning is no longer a chore but a pleasure.  You'll look forward to your workout because, even if you don't feel like doing it, it makes you feel so much better.  This is not a bodybuilding program, so don't expect ripped muscles, but do expect better health.",4,"Not perfect, but it works.",1352419200,"11 9, 2012",2012,1489,"['sister', 'sent', 'DVD', 'began', 'Bob', 'program', 'liked', 'was', 'recovering', 'successful', 'ablation', 'A', 'Fib', 'just', 'lost', '20', 'extra', 'pounds', 'was', 'doing', 'pilates', 'riding', 'bike', 'needed', 'something', 'limbs', 'have', 'same', 'complaint', 'others', 'camera', 'Bob', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'workouts', 'are', 'useful', 'good', 'order', 'tone', 'arms', 'legs', 'abs', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'progress', 'weekly', 'schedule', 'felt', 'needed', 'more', 'time', 'certain', 'week', ""'d"", 'repeat', 'was', 'ready', 'move', 'really', 'more', 'time', 'really', 'master', 'exercises', 'achieve', 'good', 'technique', 'went', 'back', 'reviewed', 'weeks', 'had', 'completed', 'program', 'What', 'ended', 'up', 'doing', 'performing', 'weeks', '7', '8', 'consecutively', '45', 'minute', 'workout', 'pilates', '35', 'minutes', 'do', 'least', 'three', 'times', 'week', 'combination', 'mountain', 'hiking', 'twice', 'week', ""'m"", 'best', 'shape', ""'ve"", 'been', 'decade', 'program', 'going', 'make', 'more', 'functional', 'able', 'enjoy', 'things', 'playing', 'kids', 'grandkids', 'instead', 'only', 'being', 'able', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'find', 'little', 'aches', 'pains', 'slowly', 'disappear', 'getting', 'up', 'morning', 'no', 'longer', 'chore', 'pleasure', ""'ll"", 'look', 'forward', 'workout', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'doing', 'feel', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'not', 'bodybuilding', 'program', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'ripped', 'muscles', 'do', 'expect', 'better', 'health']",N/A

He barely talks at all about getting in shape and some of it is repetitive.  On the workout itself I was expecting a get in shape program with lots more info from him instead its lunges...lunges and more lunges and I agree with the previous review about the camera being on him and not on the woman working out.  I found this DVD workout boring and the 8 workouts are all the same more lunges!!!! wont be using this again.,1,Terrible DVD,1264464000,"01 26, 2010",2010,585,"['love', 'Bob', 'Greene', 'books', 'watching', 'Oprah', 'so', 'just', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'was', 'advertised', 'full', 'workout', 'get', 'shape', 'bonus', 'information', 'barely', 'getting', 'shape', 'repetitive', 'workout', 'was', 'expecting', 'get', 'shape', 'program', 'lots', 'more', 'info', 'instead', 'lunges', 'lunges', 'more', 'lunges', 'agree', 'previous', 'review', 'camera', 'being', 'not', 'woman', 'working', 'out', 'found', 'DVD', 'workout', 'boring', '8', 'workouts', 'are', 'same', 'more', 'lunges', 'wont', 'be', 'using', 'again']",N/A

Looking forward to resuming when I get back home and that tells you its worth because there are few things I am looking forward to vs. staying here and holding baby forever. :)Seriously, the workouts are not time consuming for those who have little time and they get harder gradually. I really like the variety in the ab exercises.  Since I haven't  finished the DVD I should come back after my return to exercise.
