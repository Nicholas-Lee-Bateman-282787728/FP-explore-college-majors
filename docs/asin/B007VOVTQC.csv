Whether you watched &#34;The Wonderful World of Disney&#34; in the 50's/60's it doesn't matter but if you love horses you will love this true documentary--it's maybe 45 minutes to an hour long.  Injun Joe, this beautiful Palomino, goes from a cow pony/cutting horse in New Mexico through many hands until he reaches the ones that will change his future with the U.S.  Equestrian Team in Germany at the Royal International Horse Show & in London at the 1959 Pan American Games where he gets his chance when his stable mate Master William who won in 1958 comes up lame.

I searched and searched over the years hoping that someday it will be in DVD format and here it is. The gentleman who saved Indian Joe nameded the horse Nautical.
