1091247,A3CPJYAQMCUGNR,B000TKCNWY,Chris Matthews,"[1, 7]","Guy is in a go nowhere job whist dreaming away his days of flying whether it be awake or asleep. He joins the commonly accepted joke of a Space Force just so he can fly. With his country at war, he shows his cowardice at various points. Can't win a bar fight, failure at combative training at work and flees when confronted on the street. Hooks up with a religious zealot with a brat of a kid. He tries to rape her and then she blames herself for his actions. Trust me, it wasn't her fault, she's really annoying. The scene demonstrates how pathetic the protagonist is. With each new scene, his outfits get more goofy than the previous.All of this is in between many the naps he takes.It is clear that the budget went into the gorgeous visuals and not the soundtrack or story. The visuals are quite elaborate, but the story and soundtrack that simply negates it all. It takes &#34;annoying&#34; to a whole new level not seen since Nancy Grace or Rachael Maddow (forehead) got air time.Yes, people will be upset by this honest take of the movie, but there is no real good defense to these addressed concerns.&#34;Concerns&#34; I wish I had known about prior to showing this movie to a class of seven to nine-year olds in my church group here in south Texas interested in the space program. Most of them were speachless (which is a hard thing to do after all that Mountain Dew they drank) upon seeing the movie. In hindsight, it might of been a good thing called &#34;tough love&#34; since none of them are Muslim and those are the only ones NASA wants to send up into space anymore as an &#34;outreach program.&#34;",1,Uh....what the $&@# did I just watch!?,1385510400,"11 27, 2013",2013,1614,"['Guy', 'go', 'nowhere', 'job', 'whist', 'dreaming', 'away', 'days', 'flying', 'be', 'awake', 'asleep', 'commonly', 'accepted', 'joke', 'Space', 'Force', 'just', 'so', 'can', 'fly', 'country', 'war', 'cowardice', 'various', 'points', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'win', 'bar', 'fight', 'failure', 'combative', 'training', 'work', 'flees', 'when', 'confronted', 'street', 'up', 'religious', 'zealot', 'brat', 'kid', 'rape', 'then', 'actions', 'Trust', 'was', ""n't"", 'fault', 'really', 'annoying', 'scene', 'how', 'pathetic', 'protagonist', 'new', 'scene', 'outfits', 'get', 'more', 'goofy', 'previous.All', 'many', 'naps', 'clear', 'budget', 'went', 'gorgeous', 'visuals', 'not', 'soundtrack', 'story', 'visuals', 'are', 'quite', 'elaborate', 'story', 'soundtrack', 'simply', '34', 'annoying', '34', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'not', 'seen', 'Nancy', 'Grace', 'Rachael', 'Maddow', 'forehead', 'got', 'air', 'time.Yes', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'upset', 'honest', 'take', 'movie', 'real', 'good', 'defense', 'addressed', 'concerns.', '34', 'Concerns', '34', 'wish', 'had', 'known', 'about', 'prior', 'showing', 'movie', 'class', 'seven', 'nine-year', 'olds', 'church', 'group', 'here', 'south', 'Texas', 'interested', 'space', 'program', 'Most', 'were', 'speachless', 'hard', 'thing', 'do', 'Mountain', 'Dew', 'drank', 'seeing', 'movie', 'hindsight', 'might', 'been', 'good', 'thing', 'called', '34', 'tough', 'love', '34', 'none', 'are', 'Muslim', 'are', 'only', 'ones', 'NASA', 'send', 'up', 'space', 'anymore', '34', 'outreach', 'program.', '34']",N/A
1091248,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B000TKCNWY,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[34, 36]","My first viewing of ""The Wings of Honneamise"" was back in the early 90's and to tell you the truth, because it was in straight Japanese, I had no idea what the storyline was about. But of course throughout the next decade, there would be several releases such as a dub version by L.A. Hero, then came the Manga entertainment release which a dubbed and subtitled version were release and had to buy both and then a DVD release by Manga Entertainment (which was overcompressed) was released.But 20 years later, Bandai Visual/Honneamise released a ""Royal Space Force - The Wings of Honneamise"" via a combo pack for those who preferred to own it via the DVD+HD/DVD or DVD+Blu-ray Disc.Because this film has been reviewed so many times throughout the past decade online, I'm going to review this release a bit differently.It's one thing for us, that have been around for a long time viewing anime to simply claim that this film is one of the best releases out there especially if you have knowledge of GAINAX and the history behind this film.But for today's modern anime fan, after reading reviews online of ""Why?"" or ""what is the significance of this film?"", let alone hearing comments that this film is appreciated for mainly older anime fans, I figured I best explain the significance of this animated film and possibly reach out to newer anime fans who may not be familiar with this film.Back in the 70's and 80's, the majority of anime films were typically edited compilations from popular television shows. One of the most popular examples of this are the ""Mobile Suit Gundam"" trilogy films which more or less compiled and edited 50 TV episodes. And many films were created by live-action directors and the main sponsors of these films were national sponsors and toy manufacturers (this is explained in detail by an accompanying booklet included with the box set written by Hikawa Ryusuke).But in the 80's, a group of young amateurs known as DAICON FILM which were a group of college students that created anime shorts via 8mm film were given a chance to create a 35mm theatrical movie.This was very rare in the industry especially since these young students haven't had any actual achievements with the exception of Sakamoto Ryuichi (music director of the film) who was known for his music at that time.These students had to prove that they were up to the task and the group which would be known as GAINAX would make their mark by this one film alone with its intricate animation and storyline by creating a new world, a world with its own language, a world with its own vehicles, style of buildings, the clothing down to the vases and jugs used by citizens of the country of Honneamise.Every scene was well planned, from the dog fights of the airplane battles of how missiles flew through gravity, how crashing vehicles and its shards of metal and glass are flying around to the way an explosion was animated and how a fireball was truly done.To create animation in the 80's and to attempt to attain some sort of realism, ""Honneamise no Tsubasa"" (Wings of Honnemaise) was a complex film that these young creators put everything on the line and were able to create a film that was critically acclaimed and would lead to more wonderful anime such as ""Gunbuster"", ""Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water"", ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" and many more wonderful titles in the next two decades.So, for those who rented the older DVD and asked themselves ""Why is this so popular?"", you have to think in the context of when it was released, what was accomplished in the overall creation of this complex film.This is not just a film to just sit for two hours and wait for some hardcore action, this is a film that you watch, you immerse yourself in the world created by Yamaga Hiroyuki, enjoy the character designs of Sadamoto Yoshiyuki and just be amazed of how meticulous the special effects animation was by Anno Hideaki and various animation by directors Iida Fumio, Moriyama Yuji and also Sadamoto Yoshiyuki.OK, I'M SOLD...BUT WHY BUY THIS VERSION OF THE DVD, WHEN I CAN BUY THE OLDER VERSION ON eBAY or Amazon?As mentioned earlier, there was a 2000 release by Manga Entertainment. It's pretty much the VHS release that we watched back in the mid-90's with director's commentary. DVD-wise, the Manga Entertainment was just horribly compressed and it was unfortunate. If there was one reason to own that older version of the DVD, it was simply because it had the director's commentary by Yamaga Hiroyuki and assistant director Akai Takami.The version I am reviewing, Bandai Visual/Honneamise's release is just light years ahead of the 2000 DVD release.In fact, part of the reason why it took me a while to review this DVD is that I had to test the video and audio at friend's home theater setups along with mine because the Blu-ray disc was phenomenal.  I just had to find out if the video and audio is just as beautiful and awesome on a variety of setups.  This DVD+Blu-ray disc  combo set release is the definitive ""Wings of Honneamise"" release yet.So, for the new modern anime fan or newbie who have read the reviews and saw many of us put ""Royal Space Force - The Wings of Honneamise on top for must-own DVD releases, I ask you to not watch this film like you would watch a animated television show you would watch quickly.Just immerse yourself into the complex world that GAINAX has created for you.  Look at things visually and just imagine of how this was all created back in the 80's and how much detail and what was accomplished at that time.Almost like the world George Lucas has created for the ""Star Wars"" series and how fans find that special connection with a planet or land and its inhabitants, ""Honneamise"" is such a world where you can see how much was put into the creation of this world, the people living in that world and the language they speak.How much was put into creating the world through its beautiful backgrounds and animation.  Even the small things that involve a few frames, just the detail behind it is just simply amazing.So, if you can immerse yourself into this world, embrace ""Honneamise"" for its complexity and its beauty and you will discover why many of us, old school anime fans, regard this film so highly.",5,This latest release ranks in the top 3 of must-own releases for the anime DVD or Blu-Ray collector.,1218153600,"08 8, 2008",2008,6235,"['first', 'viewing', 'Wings', 'Honneamise', 'was', 'back', 'early', '90', 'tell', 'truth', 'was', 'straight', 'Japanese', 'had', 'idea', 'what',

Not so much a race as a one country attempt as supporting and paying for their race to space.  Given that on this world there is no actual competition such as that of the cold war one can understand how the issue draws a bit more fire from the populace.  Interesting story, fairly well told, very solid animation.  I could have done without the following:-The bit about moving the launch to near the border of a nation they have been at war with in the past seemed out right stupid.  What king with purse strings who had backed the project would allow that.-The religion angle was handled clumsily.  They did at least make it a different sort of religion but all religion and no romance makes for boredom.-The near rape scene and the actual apology on the victims part was painful to watch.  What's with the Japanese and their view of women!  (I know, to this day women are so frequently groped on trains that there is high demand for women only train cars at rush hour.  Of course my friend from Osaka tells me that even if a man gropes you on the train you keep quiet because it is embarrassing to bring such attention to yourself.  You just squirm away through the densely packed car while everyone looks away.)  Despite that, was it really necessary to project that view in the movie?

Cepeda,"[32, 53]","Listen, I like this film but I can't recommend Royal Space Force for the casual viewer, either.The releaser of this film, Bandai Visual, is enforcing a flawed distribution system that just won't work in the United States.  The feeling of theirs is that since Japanese DVD fans pay an exorbitant amount for special edition DVDs then American fans might do the same as well for the privilege of getting the same DVDs in the US as little as 3 months after the Japanese release rather than a year later!This is why Bandai Visual is charging an  exorbitant amount ($80 US) for Royal Space Force.  To compound the problem, they're making the consumer buy TWO discs -- one Blu-Ray and one DVD -- of the same film!  Yes, the consumer is being forced to buy two copies of the exact same film instead of being given a choice of a DVD or Blu-Ray single disc edition for a reasonable (under $30) price!The cheapest you can get this new edition of Royal Space Force online is for around $51 but even that's ridiculous for 2 copies of this film.Aside from cost issues, Royal Space is a great alternate reality science fiction movie.It is, however,  precisely because of the bungled pricing scheme and mentality that forces the consumer to buy two copies of the same film in a set that few people will see this film any time soon.Most of us still don't have a high-definition DVD player.  Why force this issue instead of giving the consumer a choice to buy one edition or the other?  Why does the consumer have to buy BOTH the standard definition and high definition DVD releases in a set??Like most of their other releases, Bandai Visual screws things up by overpricing the product and forcing consumers to accept their way or pass on the disc.

1091251,AXRWJQX8BYK7C,B000TKCNWY,"GrayD ""GrayD""","[28, 35]","I have to say that I am a great fan of the movie and based on that alone, I would easily give the movie a 5 star rating.  It is indeed a maturely themed movie and I would certainly not recommend it for children mostly because of the infamous near rape scene and some violence.---  Regarding the price, it is obviously ridiculous and easily brings down the review of the product by 2 stars.  For the people that commented that that has nothing to do with the movie, I submit that Amazon is a site for purchasing items and the reviews should include information regarding the whole product.  That includes price, video quality, sound quality, bonuses, commentaries, etc.  If you only desire a movie review, I suggest visiting an anime review site (of which there are plenty.)-  One reviewer did not seem to understand why the launch site is so near the enemy's border.  It is made clear in the movie that the launch is pure propaganda.  The government expects the launch to fail and regards the Space Force as a joke.  The launch site was a blatant provocation so that when the enemy attacks the launch site, the government could use that as an excuse for the failure.-  That same reviewer characterizes the near rape and apology of Riquinni as some sort of ""Japanese"" norm.  This I find pretty ridiculous and I suggest going to Japan and see how many women apologize to him if he attempts to rape them.Let me try to explain the near rape scene's significance.  The movie is about Shiro.  Riquinni is a supporting character.  Therefore, her actions support Shiro's character development.  Riquinni is a religious fanatic.  She is a victim of her poverty, her ""child"", her (lack of) social status, and then, her near rape by the one man she begins to trust.  And yet, she apologizes to him.  Is she really a victim?  Or has she surpassed her situation?  She did indeed hit him on the head with the vase (hardly defenseless.)  She shows great resilience in dealing with all her regular-day problems.  Her apology is an affirmation of her true spiritual beliefs - that she is ""saving"" someone (the world) and that there is something greater than her own personal needs or situation.  In my opinion, without that scene, if somehow her romance was consummated with Shiro, it would fail the overall message of the movie.  The message that one can ""be"" more.  Shiro realized the truth of that - what is the ""more"" of his life?  Shiro's answer isn't the same as Riquinni's. Yes, it is uncomfortable to watch as it should be - just the word ""rape"" is enough to cause us to cringe.  But, I hope that the some of the readers of this review can see how it is not a gratuitous scene and realize the import of it to Shiro's development.It is that kind of complexity and layering that permeates throughout the anime and makes this beyond most others.  It isn't ""a hero defeats the bad guy type of movie.""  It requires your analysis (intuitively perhaps) and so, it isn't a movie you can only watch once.

Royal Space Force, or as its also sometimes called: The Wings Of Honneamise, was an parallel universe tale about mankind's first attempt at space travel. Hiroyuki Yamaga directed this as his premiere project, although he went on to quit Gainax early on during the production of Gurren Lagann. This movie was first released on DVD and VHS by Manga Entertainment, but then again on a pricy DVD/Blu-Ray by Bandai Visual.Taking place in an alternate version of Earth, a faction of the military called the Royal Space Force has been practicing on and off to gain proper funding for their space program. Shirotsugh Lhadatt is part of the RSF, and is mainly just in the military for laughs with no real direction. However, when one of their crew dies in a test, he becomes concerned with his direction is life. While out drinking with his crew, he runs across the religious girl Riquinni who invites him back to her place the next morning. She's not some Jehova's Witness though, but seems a little to faithful to her religion to the point that it leaves her very clueless about how the real world works, like paying her bills. Lhadatt gets inspired by her devotion, and decides to live up to his lot as an astronaut by volunteering for the first planned orbital flight, otherwise the whole space program would've been shafted. The military takes over a large portion of this project claiming the rocket is a warship, and it becomes viewed by the neighboring country as a threat, so much so that Lhadatt gets targeted by some rather creative assassins. The situation escalates to where the actual launch site becomes the focus of a full blown battlezone, and the entire thing gets cancelled by the government, but the RSF decides to brave the odds by continuing with the launch. Lhadatt finally achieves his space flight, and reflects that all the hostility and wars humanity has going on seem pointless since from where he sees the world now there are no borders.This movie is considered to be the crowning achievement in Gainax's long history. The world it takes place in is modeled after own, but redone in fashionable steampunk way. It pools elements from several of our cultures into it, and seems to really dig neon lights in ways that Las Vegas never did. Gainax outdid itself with this, and set the standard for their future productions like Gunbuster. It has some of the most memorable animation you'll ever see in sequences you have trouble telling the difference between them and live-action.

1091253,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,B000TKCNWY,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[5, 14]","At the time, this debut feature from animation studio Gainax was the most expensive animated feature from Japan, with a budget of eight million yen (nowadays that might not seem like such a big deal, but this is 1987 we are talking about). Yet while the movie earned critical raves it was a stunning commercial disaster. It was not until approximately seven years later that WINGS OF HONNEAMISE finally turned a profit. Today it is hailed among Anime fans as one of the all-time masterpieces of the genre.Scripted and directed by 24-year-old Hiroyuki Yamaga, WINGS OF HONNEAMISE, is set in a bizarre Japanese/American hybrid world with futuristic technology but where the concept of space travel seems laughable. The protagonist is Shirotsugh Lhadatt, an unmotivated cadet of the often-ridiculed (and constantly threatened) Royal Space Force. When he starts a relationship with a religious woman named Riquinni, Shiro becomes inspired, and, before long, volunteers to be the first man into space.It's obvious that a lot of effort went into the animation of this movie, and the results show. For a 1987 production, WINGS OF HONNEAMISE showcases some intricately detailed backgrounds that fully realize the strange world of our protagonists. The animation itself, though not as smooth as, say, a traditional Disney cartoon or AKIRA, neither as beautiful as a Studio Ghibli film is still quite impressive. And even though the characters don't have the huge eyes or round faces of most Anime leads, they're visibly expressive. In addition to which, the camera work is amazing; watching this movie one has the feeling that they are witnessing a live-action drama rather than a cartoon.That said, WINGS OF HONNEAMISE's entertainment value might not be for everyone. Fans weaned on fast-moving fare may be put off by HONNEAMISE's languid pace. There are only two major action set pieces in the movie, and they happen about three-quarters of the way through and near the end, respectively. But mostly the movie concentrates on character development and tackles political issues. While this gives the movie a depth of complexity in its plot, there are times when the structure of the story feels unfocused. A subplot involving a war with a rival country for the rocket, in particular, seems superfluous.Then there's the relationship between Shiro and Riquinni. Mostly it develops well through the movie (with occasional chuckles coming from Shiro's confusion about whether his interactions with Riquinni are platonic or romantic); but why did the script have to include a disturbing rape attempt?  It makes even less sense in the following scene when Shiro, attempting to apologize, is instead told by Riquinni to forgive *her* for smashing a jar on his head! This controversial sequence is meant to come across as a turning point, but even still, it provides major discomfort to the audience and makes the lead character less sympathetic.One other scene that feels disjointed from the rest of the movie takes place toward the end, where, after Shiro is finally in space, we are suddenly treated to what appears to be a gradual progression of humanity. Taken on its own, this approximately four minute long sequence showcases some imaginative animation styles; this is the most artfully done scene in the movie, rendered in charcoal-like colors and set to a trippy yet surreal score (courtesy of Oscar-winner Ryuichi Sakamoto). On the flip side, this sequence interrupts (and delays) the denouement of the film, and is awkwardly transitioned into.In fact the whole strangeness of WINGS OF HONNEAMISE might be too off-putting to non-Anime fans; for an exercise in creativity and imagination, this movie excels. But the confused plot twists in this otherwise ambitious and brilliant tale may be too problematic to recommend it to viewers expecting a well-structured story. It also clocks in at two hours, and some of that running time is wasted in sequences where nothing much happens.It should be noted, too, that this is not a movie for young children. In addition to that aforementioned rape attempt scene, there is a bloody battle scene between Shiro and an enemy spy, and a climax that involves an attack on ground and air (while the Royal Space Force struggles to launch the spaceship). While these sequences have a lot more energy than the low-key tone of the picture, both are considerably violent. To be fair, though, they're also not as gruesome or sickening as in other Anime features.The movie is still worth watching, however, because of the detailed animation and ambitious concept. Not many animated features in America have attempted such a story like this, and so for that, WINGS OF HONNEAMISE does stand out. Yet the movie probably plays better to Anime fans than it may to non-fans.The American release of this film is another matter.  In 1994, MANGA acquired the rights to HONNEAMISE, providing an adequately translated and fairly well done English version, but unfortunately cheapened its DVD release with a murky visual transfer.  Having seen that and the new release by Bandai, I can safely say the new Bandai-Visual DVD is the one to get in terms of picture clarity; the video quality there is breathtaking, beautiful and detailed.  Less commendable, however, is the omission of priceless extras from the MANGA DVD release, which included a commentary by director Yamaga, a picture gallery set to the entire unadulterated score by Sakamoto, and a deleted scene.  The only extras here are the Japanese trailer and a short film that prompted the making of this film (not to mention a booklet of essays).  That it is also ridiculously overpriced (due to including the DVD in both the HD and BluRay editions rather than releasing it separately) is equally problematic.  So the question is, which version should you purchase?  It ultimately depends on the customer as well as the viewer to get the most out of both this movie and either of its two editions.",3,"Brilliant, intelligent, and dazzling for Anime fans, questionable

1091256,AU8XR7NFMD6YT,B000TKCNWY,R.B,"[2, 10]","A friend of mine ponied up the 80 dollars to get this movie on Blu-Ray, and I can honestly say that for a movie this old, the animation is spectacular. Unfortunately, that's the only possible compliment I can give to Wings of Honneamise.To start with, the pacing of this particular movie is terrible. It's basically an hour and thirty minutes of the main character feeling sorry for himself, attempting to rape an innocent religious girl (she then apologizes to him for...I don't know...being attractive and making him want to do it?), and just generally being a scumbag. At the end of that slow, almost unwatchable hour and a half, is about 30 minutes of (spoiler warning) the main character being REWARDED for being a scumbag, and then basically fufilling his dream of being famous and bringing glory to the space program that he seemingly has very little dedication to in the first place.All things considered, if you take away the animation, this movie is a mess with MAJOR pacing issues (It's ungodly slow and then super fast at the ending). While everyone else is telling you to stay away because of the exorbitant price (I don't disagree with them there) I'd also tell you to stay away from this movie because it's a train wreck, it's offensive to women (no, I'm not a woman...but give me a break), and to reiterate what some have already said, it's forcing you to pay for two copies of the exact same movie. If you are buying the Blu-Ray disc, why on earth would you also want the inferior DVD release? To give away as a present? Who are they kidding?If it's great animation that you seek, and you could really care less for the story, you'd be much better off with ""The Place Promised in Our Early Days"" (which has a good story IMO, but GREAT animation).

It looks nice for the time, but isn't as good looking as Akira, which came out a year later. Nonetheless, the world is detailed, and fully fleshed out. And it really looks like a lot of time and effort was put into the creation of this world.The reason this film is 'unique' and 'not for everyone', is due to the story. Or the way it is told, to be specific. It's deliberately slow paced, and can try the patience of those who are waiting for anime's patented action spectacles. You're not going to get that with this. This is primarily a sci-fi drama, which is told at a slower pace, similar to sci-fi films like Gattica.The slow pace allows for lots of character work, and i'm impressed with the animator's willingness to animate small gestures, looks, and conversations. The small things really make the animation stand out.The story is quite good with it's delving into religion and politics, and it builds to a pretty powerful ending.A very ambitious work, which I think is just wonderful, but is certainly not for everyone.",4,"Wonderful and unique, but not for everyone",1231027200,"01 4, 2009",2009,1358,"[""'m"", 'glad', 'finally', 'put', 'out', 'new', 'printing', 'Manga', 'one', 'was', 'so', 'terrible', 'Unfortunately', 'way', 'marketed', 'priced', 'ridiculous.The', 'film', 'quite', 'excellent', 'deserving', 're-release.The', 'animation', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'standards', 'newer', 'releases', 'Paprika', 'Metropolis', 'nice', 'time', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'looking', 'Akira', 'came', 'out', 'year', 'later', 'Nonetheless', 'world', 'detailed', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'really', 'lot', 'time', 'effort', 'was', 'put', 'creation', 'world.The', 'reason', 'film', ""'not"", 'everyone', 'due', 'story', 'way', 'told', 'be', 'specific', 'deliberately', 'slow', 'paced', 'can', 'try', 'patience', 'who', 'are', 'waiting', 'anime', 'patented', 'action', 'spectacles', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'get', 'primarily', 'sci-fi', 'drama', 'told', 'slower', 'pace', 'similar', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'Gattica.The', 'slow', 'pace', 'lots', 'character', 'work', 'i', ""'m"", 'impressed', 'animator', 'willingness', 'animate', 'small', 'gestures', 'conversations', 'small', 'things', 'really', 'make', 'animation', 'stand', 'out.The', 'story', 'quite', 'good', 'delving', 'religion', 'politics', 'pretty', 'powerful', 'ending.A', 'very', 'ambitious', 'work', 'think', 'just', 'wonderful', 'certainly', 'not', 'everyone']",N/A

Americans as a whole have relegated anime to am eclectic sub-culture of 'cos-players' and 'otaku' without so much as making a peremptory attempt to see what the fuss is all about. Movies such as this not only launch careers (Hideaki Anno and Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, to name only two) but also help the uninitiated become familiar with a new world, that of story telling and creativity the likes of which they had previously never imagined. It just happens to be animated!Highly recommended on all fronts, and if nothing else for the technical brilliance that Anno imparts as a 'special effects supervisor' for an animated film, the first time in animation history that such a title had been bestowed on an artist.

1091259,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B000TKCNWY,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[1, 1]","I've now seen three versions of this film. First I saw the VHS back in the day. Then I saw the DVD release. I remember thinking when I saw those versions that I wished the washed-out animation was restored and cleaned up because while the film was outstanding, it was kind of dreary looking (to the point of being kind of a downer).I was unsure what to expect when the Blu Ray was released but since I hadn't gotten around to getting a new version since I moved and sold my DVD, I decided to give the Blu Ray/DVD combo a go.To make a long story short this is the finest restoration/Blu Ray release of an anime I have ever seen. The cleanup of picture quality is on the level of Ah My Goddess! and Magic Knight Rayearth. While there is occasional picture degradation in dark scenes the majority of the film looks so crisp, clean, and gorgeous that I'm sure it looks better than it did in the theater. Previously washed-out and subdued colors now pop off of the screen. Details that previously were murky and muddy are now incredibly clear. I could see many, many details in backgrounds that I had missed before.The English dub on this film is one of the finest ever produced, truly a classic in every way and a stellar example of the heights that a dub can rise to (we're talking Ghost in the Shell Level). The film itself is is of course a drama classic and an animation classic with a superb story, writing, art direction, animation, and incredible world that is unlike anything you've ever seen before (it has it's own geography, alphabet, and money system in addition to completely different technology from our world), and on this release you can soak up every incredible detail. The backgrounds on this movie impressed me the first time I saw it, but on Blu Ray I kept being blown away as I noticed more and more detail.About the only thing missing on this release is the commentary that was on the one DVD release. Other than that it has incredible picture and sound, and lovely menus.
