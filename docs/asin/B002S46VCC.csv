Yet, the end result is unconvincing and the film a unbelievable mess by the end. The movie starts well enough once accustomed to the production values, but beyond the first 1/3 it just falls apart. There is little that is compelling here, neither the out of nowhere love interest, the twists, or the violence which in a couple of scenes is choreographed in a way to make it look silly. Plot points happen without feeling genuine. Characterizations, dialogue and violence are amateurish.Not horrible acting, a compelling premise, and the effort raise this to two stars for an interesting take on the coming out story; and while disingenuous and a little silly, it is surprising.

1286282,A2QIOTWDGR47HC,B002S46VCC,John Smith,"[5, 16]","This movie has a good plot. Its about a guy in a gang. It has a very gang-like feel. The music is good and the guys play their various parts well.The movie is highly sensual especially in the beginning. The main character is very good at arousing his audience. Young men in the movie had good bodies. But the movie was not very generous at showing male frontal nudity. There were quite a few times it could have given us more but it did not. While the movie was senual it didn't give many opportunities to see their genitals. I can only remember two scenes although there were many more opportunities.The movie contains drug use. There is a rape scene, violence, several sodomy scenes, little frontal nudity, and oral.I don't know if the genitals could be seen very well because i bought ON DEMAND, which i do not recommend.The movie was good and very sensual but it would have been better if it had been a little more generous with the frontal nudity.******** BEWARE OF THE ON DEMAND VERSION *******************************************************Amazon ON DEMAND is not good. I certainly WOULD NOT buy a video through them at the prices they want. The quality is HORRIBLE!1) I've watched 2 movies with ON DEMAND neither one was clear. I thought I'd try another to be sure it was NOT the movie. The pictures are not sharp and you may have to spend time adjusting the lighting get the best picture.2) Although the UnBox player will allow you to maximize the picture to fill the screen, the resolution Amazon provides is not good enough to benefit from the feature. They give you just enough but nothing more. When i maximized the screen, the movie was HORRIBLE. I could not tell the different between the people and the white wall behind them. Sunlight was too bright and prevented the people from being seen.  So the movie has to be watched without the greatest possible viewing space.3) The subtitles weren't always legible because of the bad resolution and quality of the downloads. Don't expect the picture to be BETTER than the preview online. I thought that downloading the movie would be at a higher resolution thereby providing a better quality than the quick preview. I WAS WRONG!4) There was no option for subtitles.

Is Brokeback Mountain strictly for the gay ghetto? Of course not. Anyone with a pulse and at least half a heart could relate and appreciate the film. Granted this is not Ang Lee directing Jake and Heath. Nonetheless director Simon Pearce has polished his chops on a lot of TV and tells a compelling, nuanced story successfully steering clear of the tiresome clich&eacute;s of gay genre flicks. The young actors are entirely credible in their nicely fleshed out roles. True some of the young gang member supporting actors are a little rough around the edges and Alice Payne is truly awful, but the principle players--Wayne Virgo, Marc Laurent, and especially Gary Summers in a minor, but pivotal role--are all seriously good. This movie is all around a respectable piece of good work, even if the title Shank is grossly misleading and evocative of some prison-gang-rape-in-the-showers softcore crap. BTW, there is more than one male-on-male sex and nudity scene with a brief flash or 2 of full frontal, but well shot and not at all prurient nor exploitative. This is not a good gay movie.

1286288,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B002S46VCC,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[7, 7]","I only write this to say thanks to the positive reviews on this page. I was initially put off getting this as there were so many negative posts regarding this film. But a mate got it for me and I thought it was a quietly brilliant film that truly deserved more attention.The plot loosely, is a gang from Bristol do vicious and sadistic so called 'happy slapping' and film it on their mobiles, they are a dysfunctional generally unlikeable lot held together by an invisible bond seemingly based on mutual violence and fear of the female `leader'.The main character Cal, stops a French exchange student getting a kicking and is thus ousted from the gang. He then ends up having a relationship with Olivier, but his former gang mates will not let matters rest there. The reasons reveal themselves in a manner of ways and at a rate that does not undermine the main storyline. His best mate from the gang is particularly vicious about the 'betrayal' of turning out 'queer', but as Quentin Crisp once said 'some roughs are pretty queer and some queers are pretty rough'.Some of the detractors are right in that some of the characters are overly stereo typical and there are more coincidences than a Dickens melodrama. Also suspend belief at someone gaining access to a computer quicker than a super hero. However, this is a shoe string budget effort which is watchable, well acted and actually moving in parts. And it is an indie British flick not based in London and should be lauded for that if nothing else. The sex scenes have been called soft porn by some reviewers but they just felt natural given the content and circumstances in which they take place. If you are wavering about whether to get/see this or not I urge you to give 'Shank' a go and hopefully like me you will find it very much worth the effort.",4,Gay Brit Indie film to be applauded,1304208000,"05 1, 2011",2011,1809,"['only', 'write', 'say', 'thanks', 'positive', 'reviews', 'page', 'was', 'initially', 'put', 'off', 'getting', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'negative', 'posts', 'regarding', 'film', 'mate', 'got', 'thought', 'was', 'quietly', 'brilliant', 'film', 'truly', 'deserved', 'more', 'attention.The', 'plot', 'loosely', 'gang', 'Bristol', 'do', 'vicious', 'sadistic', 'so', 'called', ""'happy"", 'slapping', 'film', 'mobiles', 'are', 'dysfunctional', 'generally', 'unlikeable', 'lot', 'held', 'together', 'invisible', 'bond', 'seemingly', 'based', 'mutual', 'violence', 'fear', 'female', ""leader'.The"", 'main', 'character', 'Cal', 'French', 'exchange', 'student', 'getting', 'kicking', 'thus', 'ousted', 'gang', 'then', 'up', 'having', 'relationship', 'Olivier', 'former', 'gang', 'mates', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'matters', 'rest', 'there', 'reasons', 'reveal', 'manner', 'ways', 'rate', 'not', 'undermine', 'main', 'storyline', 'best', 'mate', 'gang', 'particularly', 'vicious', ""'betrayal"", 'turning', 'out', ""'queer"", 'Quentin', 'Crisp', 'once', 'said', ""'some"", 'roughs', 'are', 'pretty', 'queer', 'queers', 'are', 'pretty', ""rough'.Some"", 'detractors', 'are', 'right', 'characters', 'are', 'overly', 'stereo', 'typical', 'are', 'more', 'coincidences', 'Dickens', 'melodrama', 'Also', 'suspend', 'belief', 'someone', 'gaining', 'access', 'computer', 'quicker', 'super', 'hero', 'However', 'shoe', 'string', 'budget', 'effort', 'watchable', 'well', 'acted', 'actually', 'moving', 'parts', 'indie', 'British', 'flick', 'not', 'based', 'London', 'should', 'be', 'lauded', 'nothing', 'else', 'sex', 'scenes', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'soft', 'porn', 'reviewers', 'just', 'felt', 'natural', 'given', 'content', 'circumstances', 'take', 'place', 'are', 'wavering', 'get/see', 'not', 'urge', 'give', ""'Shank"", 'go', 'hopefully', 'will', 'find', 'very', 'much', 'effort']",Shank - Rated
