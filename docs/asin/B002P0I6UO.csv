1282137,AJASGOXDLFHR9,B002P0I6UO,Ace,"[12, 46]","When a rural radio station received reports that locals are being infected with a ""rage"" type virus, they hunker down in the basement radio room to survive and to report on the unfolding disaster. When I saw PONTYPOOL with a couple of fellow Zombie film fans; two of us thought that this was a large steaming pile, while our artsy buddy loved it. PONTYPOO, as I shall now refer to this film, is a dialog driven Zombie picture that should appeal to many critics and the art house crowd. Although this dung is quickly fading from my memory, I shall try to resurrect enough of it to qualify my remarks. Many have applauded the psychological aspects of the picture, and if that is your thing then by all means scoop it up. Although the film waffles between being a Horror and a drama picture, most fans of Zombie films want CARNAGE, (of which there was little in this film). Cripes, the one scene that held promise for some serious ripping just showed the backs of the zombies then the camera cut (or panned away). What a tease. That is like making a porn film without T&A.; I'm not a ""Philistine"" as I love art & culture, including cinema (even silent films), and most genres of Horror, (including Zombie films). This picture, however, offers little to the connoisseur. Don't bore me either with the social messages that are said to pervade such films as they allow film makers to hide behind a shoddy production. I want to be entertained, and not have to attend the theater with a clipboard in one hand and my University Psychology books in the other. Adding to this bore-fest the film was almost entirely shot in one room. This material is actually more suited to live theater rather than the cinema, (where it would have been far more effective and I would have been more forgiving). Although lead Stephen McHattie did an admirable job under the circumstances, (he carried the film), even he could not rescue this from the sea of mediocrity. I will admit that the build up of tension was very well handled, however, this proved to be too much of a good thing without a pay off. The film also failed to answer many key questions such as what caused the outbreak, though there was an inference that the spoken English language was the agent responsible! WTF! I am as open minded as the next person but the film failed to present such in a credible manner and I was unable to make the leap necessary to buy into it, (though I wanted to). Other random thoughts; the makeup was amateurish, (stage one Zombies again), the set decorating was minimal and uninteresting and the few Zombies seen were unconvincing. Some of the camera work was also spotty though being confined to one room may have had something to do with it. Some of the acting was spot on while at other times it was suspect. The film was also ponderous as the pacing was slow and it seemed to take forever to see a Zombie. Further, that the movie poster appears to show an exploding Zombie head, replete with splattering blood, like a victim of a Romero head shot. Sadly, nothing of the sort happened here, and I conclude that the poster is actually misleading. Also misleading is a reviewer's comment on the front of the box art that says this film is ""Funny"". One of the few good things about PONTYPOO is that it is straight as the Director avoided the dreaded Horror-Comedy combination. This is (thankfully), a serious attempt at a Horror film. There is nothing funny about it. So, the box art is also misleading. In fact, that about sums it up, that PONTYPOO is nothing but a big tease. The positive film reviews I have read are just another example of what I call ""The Emperor's New Clothes Syndrome"". In other words, despite the praise, this is a marginal film at best, but just watch the sheep jump onto the band wagon because others have praised it for being different as well as a superior Zombie film. That in itself is not really a positive as most Zombie cinema is indeed wretched. I can see some positive elements such as McHattie's shock jock DJ performance and the tension build up in a claustrophobic setting, all of which were well executed. In reality, however, the film maker took the safe and easy ""Psychological Horror"" route because he was unable to blend true Horror with the classic Zombie. That in itself is a tall order, but pull it off and you will have a monster hit. PONTYPOO is still the tease that fails to deliver and offers further proof that there are many so-called ""Horror"" fans out there who are easily satisfied. This is an economy Zombie film that while featuring a couple of new twists with some professional gloss & convincing psychological drama, remains largely formulaic, that is; survivors hunkered down in a fight for survival, (though there is not much of a fight). You will either love or hate this film. Not recommended for hard core fans of Horror, though artsy-fartsies and pretend fans of Horror will have a field day with this one. Just watch where you step...Note: Check out SOCKMONKEY's Amazon review titled; ""I'm sorry, kiss is...what?"", which is located in the book section under the title, PONTYPOOL CHANGES EVERYTHING, (though the review is for the movie). SOCKMONKEY's summation, (quote); ""I think this is a unique case of subtext crowding out the enjoyment of a horror film"", best sums up the issue I had with this film. This reviewer also dared to challenge the mind set of the Canadian art house movie scene, to the scorn of others. Right on! Again, the Emperor's New Clothes syndrome at work...",1,Pontypoo...The tease that fails to deliver...,1257552000,"11 7, 2009",2009,5518,"['When', 'rural', 'radio', 'station', 'received', 'reports',

Still, I can't quite forgive the movie after sitting through 45 minutes of pure dreck.It should be said that the ENTIRE movie takes place inside a radio station (or recording studio).  This means if you don't particularly care for the setting, you don't have a choice but to deal with it.Did I like the setting?  It's alright.  It DOES give off a claustrophobic feeling which makes the atmosphere and storytelling a cut above the rest.  It's especially good for a zombie flick since it gives off the feeling of being completely trapped and blocked in with nowhere to go.The fact that the first half of the film is devoted entirely to a group of radio broadcasters constantly trying to figure out what's going on by communicating with people and trying to get answers *did* initially have potential, but you know, after 45 minutes and STILL no interesting conversations taking place, this ends up really damaging the potential this film might have had.After a while I was beginning to wonder if any actual suspense would even develop or if the movie writers were going for a cheap gimmick and not actually showing any zombie encounters.  Hey, this definitely crossed my mind several times.The acting is also hard to forgive.  It's definitely average at best, and I don't care how original people think the storyline is- it's no excuse for subpar acting skills.Eventually however, Pontypool does improve as the zombies make their presence known.I will give the film credit for a few things- it does develop into a decent atmosphere during the second half, there was a bit of originality pertaining to the possibility of zombies being able to read lips, and the ending is pretty good.  I don't know what the popular consensus is over the ending, but I liked it.I guess the segments dealing with the signs that people were beginning to change into zombies was a nice example of good writing as well.  The people would begin to stutter and repeat the same words over and over in addition to being somewhat forgetful, which would make everyone nervous because they knew what was about to happen to them.  This reminds me of nightmares I've had in the past, so this was some enjoyable writing.A decent movie, but not one of the best zombie films, and not a classic or anything.",3,a decent film,1272758400,"05 2, 2010",2010,2391,"['first', 'half', 'Pontypool', 'quite', 'boring', 'film', 'eventually', 'actually', 'GO', 'somewhere', 'remotely', 'interesting', 'Still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'forgive', 'movie', 'sitting', '45', 'minutes', 'pure', 'dreck.It', 'should', 'be', 'said', 'ENTIRE', 'movie', 'place', 'radio', 'station', 'recording', 'studio', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'setting', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'choice', 'deal', 'it.Did', 'setting', 'alright', 'DOES', 'give', 'off', 'claustrophobic', 'feeling', 'atmosphere', 'storytelling', 'cut', 'rest', 'especially', 'good', 'zombie', 'flick', 'feeling', 'being', 'completely', 'trapped', 'blocked', 'nowhere', 'go.The', 'fact', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'devoted', 'entirely', 'group', 'radio', 'broadcasters', 'constantly', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'communicating', 'people', 'trying', 'get', 'answers', '*did*', 'initially', 'have', 'potential', 'know', '45', 'minutes', 'STILL', 'interesting', 'conversations', 'taking', 'place', 'up', 'really', 'damaging', 'potential', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'had.After', 'while', 'was', 'beginning', 'wonder', 'actual', 'suspense', 'would', 'even', 'develop', 'movie', 'writers', 'were', 'going', 'cheap', 'gimmick', 'not', 'actually', 'showing', 'zombie', 'encounters', 'Hey', 'definitely', 'crossed', 'mind', 'several', 'times.The', 'acting', 'also', 'hard', 'forgive', 'definitely', 'average', 'best', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'how', 'original', 'people', 'think', 'storyline', 'is-', 'excuse', 'subpar', 'acting', 'skills.Eventually', 'however', 'Pontypool', 'improve', 'zombies', 'make', 'presence', 'known.I', 'will', 'give', 'film', 'credit', 'few', 'things-', 'develop', 'decent', 'atmosphere', 'second', 'half', 'was', 'bit', 'originality', 'pertaining', 'possibility', 'zombies', 'being', 'able', 'read', 'lips', 'ending', 'pretty', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'popular', 'consensus', 'ending', 'liked', 'it.I', 'guess', 'segments', 'dealing', 'signs', 'people', 'were', 'beginning', 'change', 'zombies', 'was', 'nice', 'example', 'good', 'writing', 'as', 'well', 'people', 'would', 'begin', 'stutter', 'repeat', 'same', 'words', 'addition', 'being', 'somewhat', 'forgetful', 'would', 'make', 'everyone', 'nervous', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'happen', 'nightmares', ""'ve"", 'had', 'past', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'writing.A', 'decent', 'movie', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'zombie', 'films', 'not', 'classic', 'anything']",N/A

The central conceit of this movie, the mechanism of transfer of zombie-ism, is interesting and creative; however, we get it too little, too late.I'd have been inclined to give this movie another star, but for its predictable ending.  What is it about Canadian low budget film being the new postwar German cinema in terms of the endings?

Apparently some violent mobs have been wrecking havoc in town.  Panic slowly sets in as the questions and danger escalates.This movie gets an A+ for character development.  All three members of the cast are very convincing in their roles.  But just what the hell is going on?  Is this some elaborate hoax?  More disturbing calls come in as the tension reaches its breaking point.  There are no televisions at this isolated station to confirm any suspicions.It soon becomes evident that there is some sort of infection outbreak through town, apparently spreading through the English language.  Say the wrong thing, it might cost you your life.That does sound pretty preposterous, but the story is executed extremely well.  The station is stuck with quite a dilemma--try to spread the word of warning or risk magnifying the problem.This movie obviously has something to say.  Big thumbs up for that.  The developments are not very cut and dried, but overall it is very thought-provoking.  I totally appreciate the efforts, but I think this film might just be too smart for its own good.  Pontypool gets a little bogged down within its own mystery.  Too talky, not enough action or bloody kills.  You gorehounds might be disappointed.

Coming into his last shift, he and his two producers get some disturbing news about a riot taking place in their small Ontario town of Pontypool.  The situation begins to spiral out of control, and people start dying, and the world as we know it may never be the same.I won't say much more about the plot; it's hard to describe PONTYPOOL without spoilers.  Perhaps this best describes it: it's a thinking-man's zombie film.  Although it's not really a zombie film, but there you have it.  It's a film that explores culture and linguistics, that pits the horror genre against itself.  It's a character study (anchored by a fantastic starring role from character actor Stephen McHattie) set against an apocalyptic backdrop (probably).  Tony Burgess's script (based on his novel) is smart and savage, with doses of dark humor that actually enhance the horror going on.  Bruce McDonald's direction is sure-handed and solid, limiting the film mainly to the radio station studio.  The supporting cast--Lisa Houle, Georgina Reilly, and Hrant Alianak--give realistic performances.  The entire film is anchored in reality; this is one of those movies you watch and think, &#34;Well, if this were to happen, this is how it would happen.&#34;  This reality, combined with the intelligence behind the premise, is what makes PONTYPOOL so terrifying.

Ponypool can't be lumped in with other thrillers about virus epidemics, it is much more than that. Ponypool is actually quite a unique horror film in the zombie apocalypse sub-genre, with the suspect virus stemming from the psychological. It is base on the story ""Pontypool Changes Everything"" by Tony Burgess, and well worth the watch.Veteran radio jock Grant Mazzy (Stephen McHattie) is en route to a new gig in Ponypool, arguing with his agent along the way. Driving through near blizzard conditions he stops at a traffic light and is startled by a woman who bangs on his passenger side window. She's hardly dressed for the weather.She's saying something, but he can't understand so he rolls down his window. She starts backing away from the car as he calls to her. No one else is in sight, be he hears voices. Oddly, the voices are repeating his own words, like echoes.Arriving at his new job he settles in behind the microphone and talks with his audience. He asks them if they think he should have called 911. After all, the woman could have been in trouble. But actually, she was more like a warning of trouble yet to come.As the film unfolds Grant Mazzy works on building a relationship with his new audience, and delivers local news items and other information fed to him by his producer and engineer. Only the three of them are present at the studio for the late night radio show. The studio building is otherwise vacant, dark and quiet, except for the loudspeakers mounted outside, broadcasting the show to the winter storm beyond.One news item involves a local doctor's clinic being overrun by a riotous crowd of people. The station's ""eye in the sky"" roving reporter calls in to cover the event, and he shares observations of strange behaviors. The people he sees are walking funny, talking funny, and some seem to be trying to eat others.It has something to do with the words. And broadcasting their signal outside may not be such a good idea, because before long a crowd begins to form around the studio, effectively trapping Mazzy and his crew inside. The people are repeating words, over and over.The doctor who managed to escape the clinic arrives at the studio, and they let him inside. He sheds light on the situation, the virus, and how it spreads. They bring him in to the soundproof control room so Mazzy can interview him on the air, his producer joins them, but their engineer begins acting strangely. She seems sick, and walks away for a little while.After sharing the doctor's insights with the audience, and warning them of the virus and the zombies, they are startled when the engineer returns, bloodied and crazed. She begins running herself, uncontrollably, into the window of the control room. Mazzy, his producer and the doctor look on in horror.Trapped, with zombies starting to make their way into the studio, they must learn how to beat the virus, and escape the zombies to survive.The ending is a little simple, and somewhat anti-climactic, but it works well enough. The ending, after the ending, is odd and has a little Tarantino, disjointed, Kill Bill feel to it. Strange.In all I found Ponypool to be very entertaining, suspenseful and scary, as well as mildly disturbing on a psychological level. Pontypool, Pontypool.

That it manages to go off into an unexpected direction from there is a real treat.It succeeds as a science fiction movie with some odd twists and turns.

I watch a lot of horror movies, and I am getting tired of seeing the same thing over and over.  While I love zombie movies, I went into this a little cynical. The genius is how minimal this movie is. Almost all of the action takes place inside the radio station. We only hear what is happening in the outside world, through what the characters in the movie hear. The actors are all superb.

And it is.....sort of.The Good Stuff: The performances. The cast is small. Steve McHattie is always good and he doesn't disappoint here. Lisa Houle and Georgina Reilly also turn in nice performances. Also, given that the entire movie was shot on essentially one set I have to give kudos tot he director and crew. It was shot well, lit well and the color scheme was good. It was directed well to the point of not letting the single set bore the viewer.The Bad Stuff: As cool an idea as the story is, they don't quite pull it off. The concept is so ""out there"" that they needed to build it up with clues in the first act. They don't. And as a result, when the whole reason for what is happening is dumped in the audience's lap, it's so weird it just seems to come out of left field. No one would come up with the idea without putting together pieces of a puzzle that aren't provided. Because of this, when our heroes try to figure a way out of the mess it seems nonsensical because they are trying to do so without the necessary information.As this is a Canadian production, and there are numerous references concerning the rub between the English and French Canadians, there might be vital information here that I simply don't get because I don't know the subtleties of the situation.Anyway.....This is a good film.

1282161,A3EHIGO4FNILXP,B002P0I6UO,.fgd,"[0, 1]",It did scare me in a psychological sense. In one way it is very much up to date as a horror. Its inspiration is that the tower of Babylon is the internet or media more than words babbled per se. Never mind viruses on the Internet ; the film's conceit is that within the collective unconscious a virus can travel by word association which sends people mad and murderous.The insularity of the three people running the radio station while the whole world crowds in over the air-waves is spookey and foreboding. Equally the protection of the sound-booth's thick perspex where they observe un-observed. and out-wit the virus/ zombies by scribbling notes and speaking la francais. It is scary. The film could as well be a paranoid methaphor over privacy issues as the internet fuses with and mimics the human mind. The cheap budjet  works because unusually for a film it makes the viewers use their imagination which is apt because [...] itself is invisible. Film-makers forget the unseen is more terrifying than a tower of special effects.Where the film fails is using zombies. This kills off the film and cheapens its inspiration. Somehow the DJ can only do irony. He is no good when it comes to being dramatic.. I almost gave up in the beginning as there is a large chunk devoted to twittering on air rather than building the plot and i consider twittering an act of zombie-ism. I almost missed the epilogue because it ran after the credits which no-one reads.I would say everyone should see Pontypool because it is so relevant to our age and will push a few uncomfortable buttons. Or give it a miss because someone could do this film's  in a more intelligent way. I upgraded to 4 stars the next day because the film haunted me.If this film brings to mind a great sci-fi book on the same conceit please let me know. I suspect its out there.

Robertson,"[1, 2]","Set in a local Canadian radio station (for almost the entire movie), Pontypool tells the gripping story of a bizarre zombie-like outbreak which brings the town to its knees. Grant Mazzy (played brilliantly by Stephen McHattie) is a jaded old radio DJ who starts his day like any other but ends up reporting on a series of terrifying events. Through the use of long descriptive dialogue from remote reporters and phone-ins, the movie quickly loads itself with non-visual ""implied horror"" and the tension this creates is astounding. In theory, you could pretty much listen to this without a picture, like a radio play, and get the same effect. It's basically a filmed radio play, but a very good one. At least, for a while.The first half of the movie was spellbinding, toe-curling and completely brilliant. We're left wondering what the hell is going on, just like the characters in the radio station, and a creeping fear lingers in the atmosphere. But then, roughly half way through, a Dr Mendez turns up and the movie takes a wrong turn and crashes into a brick wall. In Dr Mendez we get a ludicrous and highly illogical reason for the madness, and no matter how wildly I allow my imagination to stretch, I just cannot buy into the theory - or the so-called ""cure"" that comes later. It is tragic beyond words that a movie which was playing so perfectly, orchestrating such a gorgeous and thrilling tension, simply lost it all in one lousy narrative moment, and it never recovers from there.All over the web fans and critics alike are praising this movie for its smart originality and boldness, so maybe I just didn't get it (but nor did the people I was watching it with). Yes - it is certainly original. But at what cost? Is originality always worth it? In this case, I'd argue. I would still recommend it purely on the strength of the first half of the movie, which really is an astonishing piece of filmmaking, but be prepared for a plot twist so strange and ""out there"" that it may leave you as bewildered as I currently am. One thing I can say though, Pontypool will have me thinking about it for a long while!Picture quality beats the DVD version, but it doesn't push the limits of blu ray by any measure.

Through the description provided by the callers, the viewer is able to visualize for themselves what is going on.  I like that this movie makes you work your imagination in that regard.  The reason behind the infection was really bizarre and I found it off-putting.  The movie didn't make it believable and that kind of ruined it for me a little at the end.

However, I find the way the ""zombies"" in Pontypool become infected totally absurd... a phrase of the English language turning folks into zombies / ""virus being spread through language"", really? Sure, it is a new spin on zombies and the writers thought outside the box and good for them... but that idea made about as much sense to me as filming a remake of Night of the Living Dead in 3-D... (ooh, giant joint coming at you in 3-D... ahh,  3-D pot smoke in your face), but infection via language just killed the movie for me.28 Days Later and the remake of Day of the Dead (minus the annoying stereotypical Hollywood action Nick Cannon character) are two great examples of zombie movies where the writers thought outside the box! I just wish the makers of Pontypool had made a non ""zombie"" movie with their new fangled yet far fetched idea, or just stuck to some of the good old ways of zombieness.And now to touch on the comparison of Pontypool to Dead Air.... I don't care which came first... there is no comparison for me. Not to sound like a zombie movie snob, but when I want to watch a zombie movie, I want zombies (wither infected humans or reanimated dead bodies) trying to eat humans and humans trying to survive and not get eaten by zombies. I also need to be able to suspend disbelief, a ""lets pretend for just a moment that this could really happen."", and language being the cause of ""infection"" was just too ridiculous for me. Dead Air had believability and lots of zombie chomping action!Pontypool was a well written and produced movie. The actors were great at acting. And the plot, aside from the way people became infected was great, for a psychological horror movie, but there was just not enough zombie action goodness for me. With that said, it is by far a lot better than many of the studio budget and no budget zomidy and zombie horror movies that are lurking about, ready to cheat us out of our hard earned money, like a corporate interested (Dick Cheney) Republican politician!

Just when cinema's zombie revival experiment begins to show signs of banality, we are given a gift from an ambitious director that, although certainly difficult to digest, is one the most compelling and original zombie in ages.Working with truly terrifying source material, McDonald builds a fortress of tension out of, seemingly, nothing at all.  Indeed, nearly the entirety of the film takes place within a radio station, and even then, within the confines of a modest sound booth.  That said, it is a testament to the staggering talent of both the director and his team when I say that what is accomplished with so little is utterly unnerving.  Even for minimalist cinema, this is a film that works with mere shadows, putting its faith in the audience to fill in the frightening details.Pontypool is that rare horror film that grows more disturbing upon successive viewings.  Given its plot, which I will absolutely not spoil, it is admittedly ironic that, the more you analyze and come to learn, the more creepy things become.  It's a stunning achievement that I cannot applaud enough; it goes beyond mere psychological horror, nestling quietly in the voids of the uncanny and the abstract, and it will chill you to the bone.Indeed, this film oozes a taut indy style that few mainstream features can replicate, all the way down to a genuinely sharp script that gives the impeccably chosen cast something intelligent to work with, especially Stephen McHaddy's, who's performance is the stuff of career breakouts.It needs to be acknowledged that, yes, Pontypool is a zombie movie for people who don't want to watch the conventional zombie movie anymore - at least those that aren't directed by Danny Boyle.  And no, it doesn't necessarily require a patient or tolerant mind to enjoy the film.  That said, this certainly isn't something that you would see greenlit by the heavyweight studios, and for good reason; it lacks the docu-mocku style that has become prevalent in the genre; nor is it a shock-fest; and it is completely devoid of recognizable names.

It's not a bad movie, it's not a great movie, it's just an okay movie. It's okay because the story never has any real sense that the characters are in danger or fighting for their lives. There's no climatic escape, no near death experiences, no epic battle. It's a horror movie without the ""horror"".

Together with Georgina Reilly (""Eddie: The Sleepwalking Cannibal"") as the technical assistant Laurell-Ann, they work towards updating their listeners on local news of the morning when all hell starts to trickle loose.Although most of the film takes place within the radio station, there are still plenty of shots outside of the station that remind you of just how alone we all are at 6:00am, when the sun has yet to make itself known, and the night still holds all of us captive.You should definitely give this film a chance and join the cast on a blind journey into the unknown, where fear truly terrifies.",5,"A blind journey into the unknown, where fear truly terrifies",1375142400,"07 30, 2013",2013,1834,"['Pontypool', 'was', 'adapted', 'novel', 'Pontypool', 'Changes', 'Everything', 'author', 'Tony', 'Burgess', 'directed', 'Bruce', 'McDonald', 'argument', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'twist', 'Zombie', 'genre', 'McDonald', 'spoke', 'out', 'classifying', 'film', 'zombie', 'movie', 'Rue', 'Morgue', 'Festival', 'Fear', 'expo', '2008', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'exactly', 'what', 'said', 'are', 'spoilers', 'statement', 'think', 'would', 'do', 'viewer', 'disservice', 'know', 'seeing', 'film.This', 'film', 'not', 'blockbuster', 'amused', 'hardcore', 'gore', 'fans', 'moments', 'film', 'perfect', 'great', 'imagination', 'who', 'still', 'find', 'can', 'scare', 'night', 'when', 'are', 'alone', 'look', 'film', 'very', 'dark', 'perfectly', 'so', 'never', 'strain', 'see', 'what', 'happening', 'dialogue', 'what', 'movie', 'apart', 'rest', 'Burgess', 'such', 'great', 'dialogue', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'keep', 'attention', 'will', 'also', 'challenge', 'think.Stephen', 'McHattie', 'Watchmen', 'History', 'Violence', 'Grant', 'Mazzy', 'brooding', 'radio', 'announcer', 'who', 'finely', 'silken', 'web', 'words', 'appease', 'new', 'station', 'manager', 'Sydney', 'played', 'Lisa', 'Houle', 'Emily', 'New', 'Moon', 'Together', 'Georgina', 'Reilly', 'Eddie', 'Sleepwalking', 'Cannibal', 'technical', 'assistant', 'Laurell-Ann', 'work', 'towards', 'updating', 'listeners', 'local', 'news', 'morning', 'when', 'hell', 'trickle', 'most', 'film', 'place', 'radio', 'station', 'are', 'still', 'plenty', 'shots', 'station', 'remind', 'just', 'how', 'alone', 'are', '6:00am', 'when', 'sun', 'yet', 'make', 'known', 'night', 'still', 'captive.You', 'should', 'definitely', 'give', 'film', 'chance', 'join', 'cast', 'blind', 'journey', 'unknown', 'where', 'fear', 'truly', 'terrifies']",N/A

1282184,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B002P0I6UO,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[4, 5]","Pontypool is a unique take on the horror genre that will inevitably be paired with other zombie films.  That's a shame, because Pontypool is so much more than a zombie flick.Pontypool has superficial similarities to the 2007 zombie film Dead Air.  Both films featured shock jocks (Stephen McHattie as Grant Mazzy) trapped in a recording studio reacting to the zombie infestation on the air, with live reports from their colleagues in the field of the infestation.  The similarities end there; where Dead Air reflects on terrorism in America, Pontypool considers the virality of language.  What if an interdimensional invasion was launched through speech? English words have different meanings depending on tone, inflection, and circumstances - what if certain words, like ""honey"" were infected?Pontypool reflects on the use and abuse of words.  Throughout, Mazzy the former shock jock spars with conservative station manager Sydney Briar (Lisa Houle) over what's appropriate on the air.  Mazzy discovers a series of harsh truths through his coarse handling of his radio subjects: the cops he jokingly accuses of alcoholism are really alcoholics, the weatherman calling in from his helicopter is actually driving around in a van, and the small Ontario town of Pontypool is not interested in shock talk...until the news itself becomes shocking. Throughout, Mazzy transforms from cynical commenter to a freedom of speech crusader right up to when the ""zombies"" start banging on the studio's doors.The crux of Pontypool is a question of whether mass communication does more harm than good. Mazzy is torn between going off the air to prevent the spread of the virus and using his mouthpiece to warn the citizens of Pontypool of the plague. Mazzy's ego, like the plague itself, won't let him stop talking.The word virus in Pontypool is explained by Dr. Mendez (Hrant Alianak) as a scrambling of language from another dimension.  The infected attempt to find an audio frequency and after getting stuck on a particular word, begin to mimic the sounds they hear, eventually chewing their way through the mouths of other victims. Director Bruce McDonald calls the infected ""conversationalists.""Pontypool could easily be a stage play, relying on the timbre of McHattie's voice and the panicked reports of weatherman Ken Loney (Rick Roberts).  Much of Pontypool's horror is through sound, be it the increasingly terrified Loney or the bizarre mutterings of the infected. Pontypool is a feast for the ears.Pontypool gradually makes less and less sense as the film progresses. The good doctor conveniently shows up at the recording studio to explain how the virus works. Technical assistant Laurel-Ann Drummond (Georgina Reilly) gets infected, trapping Mazzy, Mendez, and Briar in the recording booth. And then Mazzy comes up with a variety of plans that range from common sense (he wants to leave the studio) to insane (he doesn't want to leave the studio).SPOILERPOOL: There's a reason for this.  About mid-point through the film it reaches a creepy high point in which we listen to a conversationalist's mutterings...and from then on Mazzy is likely infected.  His dialogue becomes increasingly unhinged.  Knowing Mazzy is infected, when he doesn't, only adds to the terror and helps reconcile the nihilistic ending. But don't feel too bad.  The end credits are proof that Pontypool has a sense of humor...and that transformation through language goes beyond the physical.Like The Ring and Inception, Pontypool adds radio to televisions and dreams that we didn't realize we should fear all along.  After all, the audience spent 93 minutes listening to the virus.  Not infected yet?

As he reports on the infestation of a strange virus that leads local residents to behave violently, he comes to suspect that he is himself spreading it through his words.Pontypool is a small and deceptively simple film, that takes place almost entirely inside a local radio studio, but manages to feel dynamic and engaging throughout. The isolation of the location suggests a central theme of the film, how easy it would be to lose contact with what's really going on for one who characteristically spins the truth, and whose contact with the world outside (at least for several hours each day) is through the medium of screened phone calls and wire reports. Until the fairly recent big budget Hollywood zombie craze, the zombie phenomenon in film almost always stood in for larger social issues, and this Canadian thriller revives that tendency. While provocative and shocking radio is often entertaining, what does it do to our psyches? What happens to culture when dangerous and sometimes outrageous ideas and interpretations of current events, intended to keep people listening to the radio, begin to be accepted and embraced as truth? Crazy ideas can, after all, spread like viruses, raising fear and paranoia and anger. There's also a distinctively Canadian theme here, suggestive of the Canadian francophone fear that the universality of the English language may corrupt culture.Of course, what you really want from a zombie film is terror and thrills, and, at least in the latter half of the film, Pontypool delivers the goods in a mostly satisfying way. It's not a perfect film, as there are a few plot gaps and underdeveloped characters and elements and a bit of lag time and at times the modest budget shows, but on the whole this is an entertaining and provocative film, that looks good throughout and keeps you involved and guessing.",4,"Just when you thought it was safe to turn on the radio....a scary, low-budget Canadian re-invention of the zombie thriller",1256860800,"10 30, 2009",2009,2012,"['broadcasting', 'daily', 'show', 'local', 'radio', 'station', 'small', 'Ontario', 'town', 'Pontypool', 'shock', 'jock', 'Grant', 'Mazzy', 'strange', 'things', 'going', 'infestation', 'strange', 'virus', 'local', 'residents', 'behave', 'violently', 'suspect', 'spreading', 'words.Pontypool', 'small', 'deceptively', 'simple', 'film', 'place', 'almost', 'entirely', 'local', 'radio', 'studio', 'feel', 'dynamic', 'engaging', 'isolation', 'location', 'central', 'theme', 'film', 'how', 'easy', 'would', 'be', 'lose', 'contact', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'one', 'who', 'characteristically', 'truth', 'contact', 'world', 'least', 'several', 'hours', 'day', 'medium', 'screened', 'phone', 'calls', 'wire', 'reports', 'fairly', 'recent', 'big', 'budget', 'Hollywood', 'zombie', 'craze', 'zombie', 'phenomenon', 'film', 'almost', 'always', 'stood', 'larger', 'social', 'issues', 'Canadian', 'thriller', 'tendency', 'provocative', 'shocking', 'radio', 'often', 'entertaining', 'what', 'do', 'psyches', 'What', 'culture', 'when', 'dangerous', 'sometimes', 'outrageous', 'ideas', 'interpretations', 'current', 'events', 'intended', 'keep', 'people', 'listening', 'radio', 'begin', 'be', 'accepted', 'embraced', 'truth', 'Crazy', 'ideas', 'can', 'spread', 'viruses', 'raising', 'fear', 'paranoia', 'anger', 'also', 'distinctively', 'Canadian', 'theme', 'here', 'suggestive', 'Canadian', 'francophone', 'fear', 'universality', 'English', 'language', 'may', 'corrupt', 'culture.Of', 'course', 'what', 'really', 'want', 'zombie', 'film', 'terror', 'thrills', 'least', 'latter', 'half', 'film', 'Pontypool', 'goods', 'mostly', 'satisfying', 'way', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'plot', 'gaps', 'underdeveloped', 'characters', 'elements', 'bit', 'lag', 'time', 'times', 'modest', 'budget', 'shows', 'whole', 'entertaining', 'provocative', 'film', 'good', 'keeps', 'involved', 'guessing']",N/A

Romero's""Unholy Trilogy"", Fulci'sZombie, obscure titles like Nightmare City,Left 4 Dead,The Walking Dead, the list goes on. I can't exactly put my finger on why zombies are so interesting to me, but they are. I thought I had seen everything the zombie genre had to offer. I was wrong.Pontypool is one of the most interesting and polarizing ""zombie"" films I've ever seen. It's not the best one, but it's originality and unique take on how the infection spreads make it one zombie film every horror fan needs to see. I will say this: you will either love it or hate it. After reading many reviews, it's clear that some people think it's brilliant while others think it's trash. I say give it a watch and decide for yourself.The film is based off the novelPontypool Changes Everythingby Thomas Burgess, who also wrote the screenplay. While they both share the same writer, the book and the film are very different in terms of perspective. The film is more straightforward, but this is not a bad thing. The story takes place almost entirely inside a radio station in Pontypool, Ontario and follows the radio crew as the outbreak begins. Very little of the outbreak is actual shown, with most of the carnage being described verbally. This turns out to be extremely effective because the audience's imagination creates things way more terrifying than anything the filmmakers could've shown on-screen. I know this will turn some people away, but with all the in-your-face shaky-cam horror crap out nowadays, it was quite refreshing to be scared by something so simple.I didn't want to give away major plot points, but they're why the film is so good and I want to address them - there's a reason I put the word zombie in quotation marks above. You have been warned:**SPOILERS AHEAD**The most intriguing aspect of the film is how the infection spreads: through the English language. It sounds stupid, but somehow it really works. Just the idea that speaking certain words can potentially turn you into a mindless, flesh-hungry creature is utterly terrifying. Some people may think this is ridiculous, but the way the film conveys it makes it seem very plausible. Our brains are just computers, right? Don't computers sometimes mess up, getting caught in endless loops or becoming infected with viruses, causing them to behave erratically? The notion that your brain can turn on you like that is very unnerving to me. The director has stated that the creatures aren't zombies but something else, dubbing them ""conversationalists"". Whether or not they can be considered zombies is up to you. Regardless, the methods they devise to combat the virus are ingenious and clever.**END SPOILERS**The film's cast also does a tremendous job. Stephen McHattie, who you might recognize fromWatchmen, is outstanding in his role. He plays a former ""shock-jock"" forced to do morning traffic reports. McHattie's voice is almost hypnotizing and you hang on his every word, making what would be otherwise boring scenes very engrossing. Special mention must go to Rick Roberts, the actor who voices the radio crew's field reporter Ken Loney. We never see this character, but his vocal performance was so filled with genuine terror that I was literally on the edge of my seat. It actually creeped me out, something which doesn't happen very often. The rest of the cast does a fine job.The cinematography looks fantastic. It has a very industrial feel to it, with lots of blues and greys, making scenes seem cold and unwelcoming. The snowy setting also increases the feeling of isolation. The score is minimal but highly effective, complementing the action and scares nicely. All of these things really enhance the film's atmosphere and make it all the more unsettling. The gore is minimal but well-done; if you're a gorehound, this is NOT the movie for you.To sum things up, Pontypool is definitely a thinking man's zombie movie.

1282191,A1NKJJCBBYVP4V,B002P0I6UO,"Philip C. Perron ""Philip""","[7, 12]","This film was listed as a possible best horror films of the past year by many though it usually fell short and was listed as honorable mention instead (since there were a fairly good number of such genre films this year).  So when I saw it I picked it up and decided to give it a try.  The box cover itself had a critic state it was one of the top 25 best zombie films of all time which fueled the promise it had.The film's premise is of a small town near Hamilton, Ontario and not all that far from Quebec, Canada.  It takes place almost entirely in the office of a radio station.  The main character is Grant Mazzy, the talk show host for radio 660.  His show is one of those mix of news, some humor, politics, things like that and he is in the building with his producer, a woman named Sydney, and Laurel-Anne, a young Afghan veteran who is the jack-of-all-trades employee (almost like an intern).  During the course of the film, Ken Loney, the traffic guy in the ""sunshine chopper"" but actually just driving around seeing traffic calls in and starts explaining that large numbers of people are surrounding a Dr. Mendez's office chanting the same word over and over.  At first, this seems something to do with Mendez and an illegal prescription scam and so it could be just protesters, etc.Though not a traditional zombie film (the undead walk the earth or possessed from voodoo), we soon think more on the lines of Stephen King's novel Cell or the English films 28 Days Later and its sequel.  Instead we have something resulting in a ""virus"" that may or may not travel through vocabulary and words.  And we soon find out maybe it is related to English rather than anything else (i.e. French).  The setting up of this works really well.  There are a few early bizarre happenings from an encounter at a stop sign to a guest for the show suddenly acting bizarre with an almost obsessive-compulsive disorder with speech.  And the call ins from Ken Loney are very suspenseful.This film based off its setup (almost like a play and has been written as a play too) will turn a lot of folks off, so it isn't a film for everyone.  But to me, this isn't its weakness at all.  The weakness comes more from the various expositions that happen to explain what is going on (specifically by the Mendez character) and the much too quick understanding of what may or may not be happening.  Also the behaviors and actions during parts of the set pieces are a bit too suspension-of-disbelief; with the ""infection"" of one of the main characters and the behavior of the others to him/her.  My first reaction would have been to help (since there was no immediate danger) but instead there is almost an indifference or aloofness.  And the end came way too quickly where one is left wondering who was infected and who wasn't and if those that were not infected, then why would the survival instinct quit with them especially when Quebec soldiers were apparently very close to the rescue.  And of course, the ""science"" of the ""virus"" is preposterous.After the end of the credits, there is an odd little piece which puts the film more into the Arthouse crowd and was somewhat unfortunate since it makes one just roll their eyes.  And I'm sure there is various political and social commentaries in here but that's for you to really search out (i.e. an Afghan vet and what's that mean, English Canada versus French Canada, the fright of change versus actual love, white Canada and its opinion of recent immigrants (Arab, Hispanic, maybe the Asian subcontinent, etc.))Anyways, the film is pretty good.  Probably 3 1/2 stars, weaknesses or not.  It is very suspenseful and works well when it is not doing its silly exposition.  The main characters are bit of the pompous type which is more of a statement for its ""arthouse"" feel, its author, and its director, than more than its story.  I'd still recommend it and definately would give it a thumbs up.  I just wish the main characters were more likeable, the pretentiousness was absent (the author of the story even tries to claim they are not zombies but ""conversationalists""), and the science and exposition worked better.  Having no understanding of what was going on would have made a better story than a half understanding.

1282193,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B002P0I6UO,RMurray847,"[2, 2]","Horror movies and sci-fi movies often fall victim to a particular bad habit that drives me crazy:  the poor explanation.  These movies deal with ""weird"" things happening.  Sometimes, no real explanation of how these things came to be is needed:  we understand a ""ghost haunting a mansion"" without needing a lot of rationale behind it.  Sometimes things just are.  Think of George Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.  The dead were coming to life and feasting on the living.  Why?  Who cared?  No real effort at an explanation was offered or needed.Sometimes, though, one of these movies will postulate an unusual scenario that may be very intriguing, original, scary, creepy (or any combination of those)...and it will offer explanations of what is happening.  Yet the explanation is either vague or offered speedily where you can't keep up or is even meant to be somewhat incomprehensible.  For a good recent example, PROMETHEUS seemed to offer up answers...but it only gave a few pieces of a puzzle.  I don't mind ambiguity if that is the intent, but some films either a) think they're giving you all you need to know to understand what's going on or b) they want you to THINK they're giving it all to you, when they're actually holding back.  In either case, it's aggravating.And it's particularly aggravating when the movie is otherwise quite enjoyable.  I just watched the ""zombie"" movie PONTYPOOL, and really enjoyed great heaps of it...but was flummoxed by the supposed ""explanation"" and ""cure"" that was offered up.  I understood up to a point, but in the final few scenes, the lead characters had some sort of additional breakthrough in their understanding that I didn't follow.  So, instead of enjoying the tense final moments of the film, I was sitting in my seat trying to make some sense of it, and hoping against hope that the final pieces would be given to me.  But sadly, I think the filmmakers thought they HAD given all they needed to.So the movie ended up making me feel a little stupid.  Perhaps if I watched it again, I'd catch more...but there are so many movies I haven't seen once, I'm not going to spend another 97 minutes watching this one again in the hopes of understanding more.PONTYPOOL is set almost entirely in a small radio station in the small town of Pontypool, Ontario, Canada.  We see talk show host Grant Mazzy (Stephen McHattie, never better) arrive for another shift.  He's apparently a big name in talk radio, a shock jock, who has lost his big city job and is now relegated to a sleepy backwater town.  He's asked to report on school closings and community events.  His efforts to provoke his audience are not appreciated by his producer Sydney (Lisa Houle), so he's turned to drink and simply going through the motions.  On this particular day, the snow is coming down hard, and the whole movie is permeated with a tangible sense of coldness.  Grant, Sydney and production assistant Laurel Ann (Georgina Riley) are ensconced and entrapped in their basement studio.  And that's when weird things start happening.  In a series of very effective scenes, Grant interviews the station's traffic reporter Ken (whom we never see) as he witnesses riots turning deadly at a doctor's office and later, babbling mobs killing and eating innocent bystanders.The word ""zombie"" is never used, just as it never comes up in 28 DAYS LATER...but this is a film about people catching an easily communicable disease that causes them to want to eat uninfected humans.  I don't want to spoil just what seems to be causing this zombie-like behavior...but let's just say it causes the affected to behave in strange and remarkably creepy ways.  This is a tiny, quiet movie about the zombie apocalypse.  But its claustrophobic nature works FOR it.  We actually see very little happening (enough, but less that movies usually give us)...we hear it.  So as the sense of disbelief gives away to horror amongst the crew of the radio station, we feel a sense of dis-ease settle over us.  This is not a scary movie, exactly...it is extremely creepy, however.  A sense of dread is well developed.  PONTYPOOL is based on a novel, but it was also once a radio play.  And this makes total sense...I can easily imagine the radio play, because in a way, the movie feels the same way.  Lots of listening to phone conversations.  Lots of talking.PONTYPOOL is not a fast paced film, and will not appeal to fans of zombie movies with lots of gore.  Bloodshed is at a great minimum.  But I personally appreciated the uniqueness of the approach...we are sitting in this radio station in the cellar of a church right with these 3 characters...and we listen to the horror going on just outside and closing in ever faster.  I very much appreciated the tone of the film, the fine performances and the unusual setting and approach.But, as I said before, I certainly didn't enjoy being left out in the cold as our main characters had their big breakthroughs in the final scenes.  Could the writers NOT have been just a little clearer?  Could the actors NOT have enunciated a bit more carefully?  Could an editor not have left a smidge more in?  Could the director not have looked at the final product with the eye of the intended audience?  I admit, I may simply be a bit dull-witted and missed a perfectly clear explanation...but assuming I'm not too stupid, I really feel this largely successful movie let me down in the end.  This takes the film from a 4-star recommend to a 3-star barely recommend.",3,"Creepy and effective, but with a hurried, muddled ending.",1371427200,"06 17, 2013",2013,5492,"['Horror', 'movies',

making something big from something little.And the surprising thing of all is,that against all odds,it works.The story finds a radio talk host,McHattie,in the rural town of Pontypool,Ontario(in the

who came towards his stopped car,then mysteriously backed away.The first glimmer of something really amiss comes when the stations ""eyes in the sky"" reporter witnesses the walls of a doctors office

not to use any terms of endearment and not to speak English.Things start spiraling downward from here,even to getting a hook up with a BBC program who seem to think this incident and others they have heard about there,are related to separatist activities.The stations""eyes in the sky"" reporter now becomes holed up on a farm and witnesses the crowds walking by and their strange behaviour and babblings.Eventually the reporter himself starts to talk in riddles and they must cut him off.Time passes and the doctor,whose office walls were blown outward by a sea of people,arrives at the station.The talk host,the producer and doctor,hole themselves up in the sound booth.The station assistant starts to act erratically and she eventually kills herself outside the booth trying to get in.Then the station itself is under siege from the populace.Gun fire and explosions are heard on a more and more frequent basis as the military has moved in and are trying to control the situation,but speaking over loudspeakers,only French.The talk show host and his producer come to the conclusion,with the doctors help,that it is certain words and their understanding of them that have somehow infected the people.This then leads people into a stage of confusion,being unable to express themselves.They then,as it was described in the film,start chewing or biting at other people,usually their faces/mouths.Before they can get their message or ""cure"" out to the locals,the station is bombed.Yes,words DO in fact kill in this film.It is a verbal virus that turns seems to short circuit peoples minds and turns them into dazed and confused individuals.Zombies,as in viral infected individuals,they are not.The actors here go through a broad range of emotion from the first frame to the last.McHattie turns in a boffo performance as the talk show host who not only has to deal with a career demotion,but his first day there feeling his way through,THEN to top it all off the circumstances that follow.His producer has the same kind of emotional charge as McHattie,yet from her producers perspective.As the tenseness of the action heats up so does the rising emotions of the actors to match it,level for level.It was a fine performance by all.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35;1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include commentary and the radio adaption of the film.All in all a fine Sci-Fi psychological film about a simple idea,that of words infecting peoples minds,that turns into a much more deep and complicated play than one could imagine.Not perfect but riveting,with good performances had by all.",4,When words can kill!,1358380800,"01 17, 2013",2013,3930,"['Pontypool', 'released', 'March/09', 'Stephen', 'McHattie', 'Grant', 'Mazzy', 'Lisa',

1282197,A34EY7MQR6QFRA,B002P0I6UO,"Robert K. ""Since hollywood wants to do nothin...","[0, 0]","Pontypool is a difficult film to classify, in my opinion. Most who view it will feel comfortable saying it is simply a &#34;zombie horror,&#34; which makes sense, but I personally feel the movie moved beyond that in its approach to that which infects the characters. I will say this from the outset, if you want to watch a smart, psychological thriller wrapped inside a zombie horror, with plenty of suspense present, this is a film you should watch.The film's setting is the small Ontario hamlet of Pontypool which is beset in the dead of a snowbound winter. Stephen McHattie's character (Grant Mazzy) is a radio personality who has obviously fallen on humbling times. You'll find his character is not only enraged at his agent (for his inability to find him a more prestigious market), but Mazzy has been the architect of his own demise to such a low, meager market. Mazzy is a cynical, opinionated, alcoholic whom we find was drummed-out of previous jobs due to his confrontational style.Mazzy's rebellious nature surfaces quickly when the station producer/head Sidney Briar (played by Lisa Houle) has to constantly badger him about keeping focused on simply reporting the news and playing music and commercials without providing his usually-biting commentary. A sympathetic ear is lent by assistant Laurel-Ann Drummond (played by Georgina Reilly). These three characters are the principle focus of the movie as the overall plot becomes more apparent. This initial character development was extremely well done.Reports begin trickling into the station about a heretofore unheard of event in this town: a riot. A friendly citizen who poses as a news helicopter (when he is actually sitting in his car on a hill overlooking the area) phones-in reports of what looks to be a civil disturbance at a Doctor Mendez's office, but then unfurls quickly into a violent assault in which the building is partially demolished with several fatalities and the appearance of a convoy of military trucks. ...And then the line goes dead as the citizen loses his cool and simply wants to escape the area. And this is how much of the action is conveyed: via phone reports. I found this to be an extremely effective and unsettling way of painting the setting of a rural area suddenly beset by outright, unexplained mayhem.More reports begin flowing and then flooding into the station, but Briar in a managerial fashion, demands that Mazzy conduct an in-station interview of a singing troupe cast in an area musical. Mazzy is brazenly nonplussed while listening (and openly mocking them), but the plot is advanced directly on scene. After the troupe finishes their song, one of the singers begins babbling unintelligibly to the confusion of everyone. However, with an additional phone call from the midst of the violence occurring outside, we begin to realize that those committing the violence as well are babbling and repeating strange phrases. The suspense is ramped-up when station assistant Drummond begins repeating her words as well. Lending clarity is Dr. Mendez, who barely escaped his demolished office and appears with the infected on his heels. From there, all involved play a part in solving what ails the town.What I liked most about this film is in its unique take on a zombie-like infestation, it doesn't degenerate into comedy relief or guns blazing. It was intended to start AND finish as a psychological thriller as well as a horror film. The way the &#34;disease&#34; is spread is a brilliant take on this genre especially when compounded by what looks like a purposeful presence of the military. Don't get me wrong, I've immensely enjoyed certain comedic or shoot-'em-up zombie films, but Pontypool was not intended to be this. For an independent film, its production values are not only excellent, but completely acceptable and believable to the audience. You have no choice but to experience the cast's isolation. Bruce McDonald did a great job directing a terrific script by Tony Burgess, on whose novel the film was also based.",4,"A Terrific, Unique Mix of a Zombie Horror and Thriller Mystery",1401494400,"05 31, 2014",2014,4033,"['Pontypool', 'difficult', 'film', 'classify', 'opinion', 'Most', 'who', 'view', 'will', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'saying', 'simply', '34', 'zombie', 'horror', '34', 'sense', 'personally', 'feel', 'movie', 'moved', 'approach', 'characters', 'will', 'say', 'outset', 'want', 'watch', 'smart', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'wrapped', 'zombie', 'horror', 'plenty', 'suspense', 'present', 'film', 'should', 'watch.The', 'film', 'setting', 'small', 'Ontario', 'hamlet', 'Pontypool', 'beset', 'dead', 'snowbound', 'winter', 'Stephen', 'McHattie', 'character', 'Grant', 'Mazzy', 'radio', 'personality', 'who', 'obviously', 'fallen', 'humbling', 'times', ""'ll"", 'find', 'character', 'not', 'only', 'enraged', 'agent', 'inability', 'find', 'more', 'prestigious', 'market', 'Mazzy', 'been', 'architect', 'own', 'demise', 'low', 'meager', 'market', 'Mazzy', 'cynical', 'opinionated', 'alcoholic', 'whom', 'find', 'was', 'drummed-out', 'previous', 'jobs', 'due', 'confrontational', 'style.Mazzy', 'rebellious', 'nature', 'surfaces', 'quickly', 'when', 'station', 'producer/head', 'Sidney', 'Briar', 'played', 'Lisa', 'Houle', 'constantly', 'badger', 'keeping', 'focused', 'simply', 'reporting', 'news', 'playing', 'music', 'commercials', 'providing', 'usually-biting', 'commentary', 'A', 'sympathetic', 'ear', 'lent', 'assistant', 'Laurel-Ann', 'Drummond', 'played', 'Georgina', 'Reilly', 'three', 'characters', 'are', 'principle', 'focus', 'movie', 'overall', 'plot', 'more', 'apparent', 'initial', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'extremely', 'well', 'begin', 'trickling', 'station', 'heretofore', 'unheard', 'event', 'town', 'riot', 'friendly', 'citizen', 'who', 'news', 'helicopter', 'when', 'actually', 'sitting', 'car', 'hill', 'overlooking', 'area', 'phones-in', 'reports', 'what', 'be', 'civil', 'disturbance', 'Doctor', 'Mendez', 'office', 'then', 'unfurls', 'quickly', 'violent', 'assault', 'building', 'partially', 'demolished', 'several', 'fatalities', 'appearance', 'convoy', 'military', 'trucks', 'then', 'line', 'dead', 'citizen', 'cool', 'simply', 'escape', 'area', 'how', 'much', 'action', 'conveyed', 'phone', 'reports', 'found', 'be', 'extremely', 'effective', 'unsettling', 'way', 'painting', 'setting', 'rural', 'area', 'suddenly', 'beset', 'outright', 'unexplained', 'mayhem.More', 'reports', 'begin', 'flowing', 'then', 'flooding', 'station', 'Briar', 'managerial', 'fashion', 'Mazzy', 'conduct', 'in-station', 'interview', 'singing', 'troupe', 'cast', 'area', 'musical', 'Mazzy', 'brazenly', 'nonplussed', 'listening', 'openly', 'mocking', 'plot', 'advanced', 'directly', 'scene', 'troupe', 'song', 'one', 'singers', 'babbling', 'unintelligibly', 'confusion', 'everyone', 'However', 'additional', 'phone', 'call', 'midst', 'violence', 'occurring', 'outside', 'begin', 'realize', 'committing', 'violence', 'well', 'are', 'babbling', 'repeating', 'strange', 'phrases', 'suspense', 'ramped-up', 'when', 'station', 'assistant', 'Drummond', 'repeating', 'words', 'well', 'Lending', 'clarity', 'Dr.', 'Mendez', 'who', 'barely', 'escaped', 'demolished', 'office', 'infected', 'heels', 'there', 'involved', 'play', 'part', 'solving', 'what', 'town.What', 'liked', 'most', 'film', 'unique', 'take', 'zombie-like', 'infestation', ""n't"", 'degenerate', 'comedy', 'relief', 'guns', 'blazing', 'was', 'intended', 'start', 'AND', 'finish', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'as', 'well', 'horror', 'film', 'way', '34', 'disease', '34', 'spread', 'brilliant', 'take', 'genre', 'especially', 'when', 'compounded', 'what', 'purposeful', 'presence', 'military', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'ve"", 'immensely', 'enjoyed', 'certain', 'comedic', ""shoot-'em-up"", 'zombie', 'films', 'Pontypool', 'was', 'not', 'intended', 'be', 'independent', 'film', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'excellent', 'completely', 'acceptable', 'believable', 'audience', 'have', 'choice', 'experience', 'cast', 'isolation', 'Bruce', 'McDonald', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'directing', 'terrific', 'script', 'Tony', 'Burgess', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'based']",N/A

Quite simply, it's nothing more than verbal feedback concerning an invasion/infestation of zombies. It incorporates the cliche of ""what you don't see is most scariest"". It relies on a build up and suspense rather than showing you anything. The movie is very well made but, the premise is just not that entertaining.All it is, is a talk radio station that describes a zombie invasion. Instead of actually seeing the carnage, you just get to hear it get described...in dramatic fashion.While the movie has excellent acting and intriguing atmosphere (which you must have to pull this off), since there is nothing visual going on, your typical horror fan will be bored.A similar, yet highly superior film, is Oliver Stone's ""Talk Radio"". That movie is so much better because it uses the radio format for suspense but corroborates it with visuals. With that movie, it involved the concept that the DJ was going to get killed with the suspense being who and how would this inevitable killing take place. In ""Pontypool"", the premise of ""zombies"" should require visuals (it's a monster movie after all...show me the monsters!)If this was a play, I would find ""Pontypool"" mesmerizing.

The film focuses on a shock jock radio host in the small Canadian town of Pontypool. Turns out that his mouth has gotten him kicked off the airwaves and he's getting one last chance in the only town that would take him. While on his way to work he almost hits a woman who's wandering about in the snowstorm. As he checks to see if she's unharmed she mumbles something incoherently and disappears into the blinding snow. Our hero continues onto work just a tad bit confused.At work he goes through his usual shockjockery but decides to share his run in with his listeners. ""what should I have done?"" he asks ""call 911?"" ""keep driving?"" Suddenly his show is unraveled by reports from his ""eye in the sky"" helicopter reporter that the once quiet town of Pontypool is being overrun by a mob. They all seem to chanting in unison and tear into their unsuspecting victims with reckless abandon. The mob is growing, and heading straight for the radio station. As the radio host and friends make preparations and baton down the hatches they slowly discover the strange reason for Pontypool's decent into madness.Pontypool is a solid if somewhat unfocused ""zombie"" film. I say unfocused because I found the reason for the outbreak to be poorly explained and just a bit absurd. The film's best qualities are it's ability to keep you engaged and guessing.

He recently was fired from a large show that he was doing and now is stuck working in Pontopool, Ontario where he considers each piece of news to be nothing but painful to have to report as there is nothing overly controversial that he can focus on. His entire way to receive ratings is to get people worked up and his new show follows the same formula as much as possible even though he clearly on a much tighter leash than he is used to.We enter on a day that appears to be perfectly normal for the station but soon realize that something is happening. First a few reports of random violence and murder it quickly builds up as there is an increase of reports building up. The problem is that with the reports we are hearing as the hysteria increases is that there is an increase in people not making sense with what they are saying by either repeating themselves or just not making sense. People are angry, confused, scared, and its becoming nothing but hectic in the streets and soon surrounding the station as well which come to a head as people in the station itself also stop making sense. Grant in a random train of thought comes up with the solution to the problem and it's one that is completely terrifying in nature. Language itself is what is causing the epidemic.",4,Language causes a zombieesque outbreak?

Grant Mazzy (Stephen McHattie) is a fallen from grace radio newscaster who likes to philosophize his broadcasts to the dismay of his small Ontario town employer Sydney Briar (Lisa Houle).  Laurel-Ann Drummond (Georgina Reilly) who screens calls and runs the boards likes Mazzy's style and sides with him in minor disputes with Sydney.As Mazzy starts his broadcast the town goes viral in an ""Impulse"" (1984 Meg Tilly) type of way. What I disliked about the DVD cover description is that it gives you the cause of the infestation, which takes away from the fun of trying to figure it out. The production is shot rather modestly inside a radio station. This could become a zombie play, although the infected people are not true zombies even by our expanded movie definition.The production has a unique plot and well played.

1282207,A373R1CJT7JEKT,B002P0I6UO,titania86,"[4, 4]","** This review contains spoilers. **Grant Mazzy is a shock jock who used to be big on the radio, but now is condemned to the purgatory of a small town local morning show. He wants to challenge people and incite a reaction like he used to, but his supervisor, Sydney Briar, is only concerned with the basics. Weird reports start coming in from various eye witnesses about riots outside of a doctor's office. Over time, the details come together and the picture starts to become clear: people have started to suddenly go insane and attack others. People are being eaten and killed out there. Their town has descended in to chaos and all they can do is try to report what they know, which isn't much. How long will they be safe holed up at the studio? What is really causing this frightening behavior in people?I read the book this movie was based on and it was very strange and nonlinear. I didn't really know what to expect from the film version, but I braced myself for weirdness. The film is linear in its storytelling, but still has the ambiguity and odd feeling of the novel. The film is separated pretty clearly into 2 parts. The first part is simply establishing the characters and then throwing them into a crazy situation that they struggle to figure out. There are only three main characters: shock jock Grant Mazzy who is desperate to keep some of his edginess in a run of the mill job, Syndney Briar who is Grant's supervisor and sympathizes with him but also wants to keep the necessities in her show without alienating her audience, and Laurel-Ann Drummond who is the idealistic technical assistant and slightly enamored with Grant. The radio show goes on like normal for a little while until one of their reporters calls in terrified of a large crowd of people outside of a doctor's office, attacking and eating each other and gibbering incoherently. Then, thing hit close to home when their studio is attacked on all sides and Laurel-Ann becomes infected. They experience the horror first hand and try to not contract the disease themselves.I really like the new concept of zombies in this film. The disease is a virus transmitted through speech and only exists in the English language. It manifests in three stages. In the first stage, the person gets stuck on a word and keeps repeating it over and over without even really realizing it. The second stage is where their ability to speak coherently at all fails and they get frustrating at not being understood by others. The third stage manifests in violence when the frustration gets to be too much to bear and the person with the virus has to attack and eat other people, usually one specific person whose speech they mimic until their victim is dead. The most frightening version of this in the film is when Laurel-Ann becomes infected and goes through all the stages in front of them. The way she continually throws herself against the glass of the sound booth to get at them with no concern for her own well-being is more frightening than a horde of zombies trying to get into the studio.Three things worked extremely well for me in this film. One is the part where people are calling in and relaying the horrors they have seen to Grant. It's horrifying to hear and feel their terror without seeing what is causing it. The visuals we as the audience can conjure up in our minds are much more frightening than anything any filmmaker can put on the screen. This scene is quite disturbing and more effective than I thought it would be. The second is the claustrophobic setting. Except for the very beginning, the entire film takes place in the radio studio building with only 3 characters being the main focus. The studio itself is fairly small and gets even smaller when parts of it are inaccessible due to zombies. It makes it seem like their whole world is reduced to that small building (or just parts of it) because the world is no longer safe and the danger will eventually make its way to them. The third is the disease itself. It's so unique and weird, but is used as a commentary for our society. People in this film turn murderous when not understood, but language in American society is becoming more and more distorted and less important. The vast majority of people would rather watch a film than read a book and abhor watching foreign films because reading subtitles is too much of a chore. Language to a lot of people is reduced to 140 characters tweets, Facebook updates, and text speak. Discourse and real language is no longer a priority to our society when Jersey Shore is one of the most watched shows on TV.I really like Pontypool. It is an unexpected film that is a great addition to the zombie genre. Stephen McHattie, Lisa Houle, and Georgina Reilly give great performances that really set this film apart from the shambling masses of zombies films. The only thing I didn't like about it was the very ending scene after the credits. It just served to confuse the audience. The story is undeniably unique and may not be for everyone, but I would encourage any zombie fan to give it a try.",4,A unique take on the zombie film,1347753600,"09 16, 2012",2012,5079,"['**',

When one considers the fact that some who worked on the film did not consider it to be a ""zombie"" film, it serves to outline the reasons the film works so well.  The ""happenings"" that occur in the small town of Pontypool can be seen in many different ways.  Certainly, the strangeness of the movie make the situational horror manifest itself within the confines of several interpretations.  The ""bad"" guys can be seen as zombies, insane, victims, etc.  What makes the movie so incredible is the Oscar worthy acting by Stephen McHattie.  McHattie's portrayal of Grant Mazzy is dizzying.  His performance is by far one of the most outstanding and riveting in any genre.  When this fact is coupled with one of the most intriguing plots in the history of film, the viewer gets a rare recipe for greatness.

1282209,A96JD9312DHWC,B002P0I6UO,"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S""","[1, 1]","When the town of Pontypool woke up this morning, they never expected a day like today. Neither did the D.J. taking to the town's airwaves or the people outside of the town or the rest of the world. Something starts to happen, however, and it is one of those weird little things. People basically start to lose it, sometimes in some singular way and sometimes in larger groups, and that leads to massive amounts of madness. As the things start to become worse and the world looks on, the answers become odder and the words said become stranger and stranger.Pontypool is an interesting idea but it is one that develops strangely. Iy has a lot of ideas it wants to try and develop, too, and those ideas are not exactly the easiest to get across. Sure, some of them sound like they would work when you start to try them out, but how easily does something come across when you put an idea into practice? Vague - I am trying not to spoil anything so it is that. Still, it is a valid concern when you get into just what is driving people to the brink.When it comes to the acting in the movie, you have different flavors that move througout the film. Sometimes it is one of those moments when a person is trying to say something with overacting in their minds and sometimes it is a perfect delivery that happens to take place. Regrdless, it works out in large part because the movie is a broadcast that we are tuning into, and we hear some of the horro as it plays out. That means that we hear a lot of people, sometimes at the wors tof times and sometimes at their end, and it stretches the notion of what is happening.I like it, too, and the way it plays out.The people that become ""infected"" are not in the movie a lot, but when they are they are inspiring to a degree. sometimes it is the way that they showcase madness and sometimes it is the way that they bang their head against a soundbooth. whatever the case, the force of the movie is in that and in the wording and in the motions that sleep between the this and the that.It is watchable, but it can become convoluted when you hear some of the explanation.When it comes to wathcing this, I am of two minds. I liked the movie BUT i like a lot of movies, and some of it threw me when it was explained. As I said before, there are ideas and there are ideas with explanations attached. These sometimes are threadlike in their ties that bind and, in the process of showcasing the intellectual, they lose people. This can be a really flawed thing when it comes to the delivery that sleeps in a movie that is not bedgeted to compensate for that, and I am not certain that everyone can overlook that. If, however, you do not mind the ""why"" and enjoy the chase, then this is a nice fim. It has a broadcast that explains everything and it captures a lot of what extras oftentimes try to accomplish. This makes it a strong 4.5 or 4.6, rounding into the B-movie 5 star roster.Thank you.",5,B-movie horror gold that is not everyone's bread and butter,1292976000,"12 22, 2010",2010,2926,"['When', 'town', 'Pontypool', 'woke', 'up', 'morning', 'never', 'expected', 'day', 'today', 'did', 'D.J', 'taking', 'town', 'airwaves', 'people', 'town', 'rest', 'world', 'Something', 'starts', 'happen', 'however', 'one', 'weird', 'little', 'things', 'People', 'basically', 'start', 'lose', 'sometimes', 'singular', 'way', 'sometimes', 'larger', 'groups', 'massive', 'amounts', 'madness', 'things', 'start', 'become', 'worse', 'world', 'answers', 'become', 'odder', 'words', 'said', 'become', 'stranger', 'stranger.Pontypool', 'interesting', 'idea', 'one', 'strangely', 'Iy', 'lot', 'ideas', 'try', 'develop', 'too', 'ideas', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'easiest', 'get', 'Sure', 'sound', 'would', 'work', 'when', 'start', 'try', 'out', 'how', 'easily', 'something', 'come', 'when', 'put', 'idea', 'practice', 'Vague', 'am', 'trying', 'not', 'spoil', 'anything', 'Still', 'valid', 'concern', 'when', 'get', 'just', 'what', 'driving', 'people', 'brink.When', 'acting', 'movie', 'have', 'different', 'flavors', 'move', 'film', 'Sometimes', 'one', 'moments', 'when', 'person', 'trying', 'say', 'something', 'overacting', 'minds', 'sometimes', 'perfect', 'delivery', 'take', 'place', 'Regrdless', 'out', 'large', 'part', 'movie', 'broadcast', 'are', 'tuning', 'hear', 'horro', 'out', 'hear', 'lot', 'people', 'sometimes', 'wors', 'tof', 'times', 'sometimes', 'end', 'notion', 'what', 'happening.I', 'too', 'way', 'out.The', 'people', 'become', 'infected', 'are', 'not', 'movie', 'lot', 'when', 'are', 'are', 'inspiring', 'degree', 'sometimes', 'way', 'showcase', 'madness', 'sometimes', 'way', 'bang', 'head', 'soundbooth', 'case', 'force', 'movie', 'wording', 'motions', 'sleep', 'that.It', 'watchable', 'can', 'become', 'convoluted', 'when', 'hear', 'explanation.When', 'wathcing', 'am', 'two', 'minds', 'liked', 'movie', 'BUT', 'lot', 'movies', 'threw', 'when', 'was', 'explained', 'said', 'are', 'ideas', 'are', 'ideas', 'explanations', 'attached', 'sometimes', 'are', 'ties', 'bind', 'process', 'showcasing', 'intellectual', 'lose', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'really', 'flawed', 'thing', 'when', 'delivery', 'movie', 'not', 'bedgeted', 'compensate', 'am', 'not', 'certain', 'everyone', 'can', 'overlook', 'however', 'do', 'not', 'mind', 'why', 'enjoy', 'chase', 'then', 'nice', 'fim', 'broadcast', 'everything', 'lot', 'what', 'extras', 'oftentimes', 'try', 'accomplish', 'strong', '4.5', '4.6', 'rounding', 'B-movie', '5', 'star', 'roster.Thank']",N/A

The gore is kept to a minimal output , the film is like an updated take on the Val Lewton 'less is more' horror tactic.
