It is like the Tv series has really grown up and can now  compete with the likes of Mulan and The Lion King! A great message, some  very interesting (weird) characters and a nice little twist. Add to this  humour, danger and cute little Pikachu. What more could you want?This is  the story of a human created advanced pokemon called Mewtwo and his quest  for purpose. It involves attracting all the best pokemon and their trainers  for a fight to the death. Typical man creates beast, beast supercedes man,  beast learns humanity stuff. But on the way you learn how powerful Mewtwo  really is, what his creators were really up to, the dangers of genetic  cloning and how really loving your pokemon helps them become the very best.  There is actually real emotion when the pokemon and their clones are  fighting eachother and Pikachu refuses to fight. I had to pass my son my  tissue (I had something in my eye of course).The usual characters are  there (I cannot believe I can remember them), Ash, Missy, Brock, Squirtle,  Bulbasaur, Team Rocket and of course Pikachu along with the original Mew  (comes a close second on the cutes stakes).Loads of extras include the  very funny Pikachu's vacation, pictures, a music video and some download  stuff and of course a look at the next Pokemon movie!So, stop being  cynical go watch it with your kids and enjoy.

118498,A565PMDP4YNU4,0790748266,Big Joe '83,"[4, 24]","The crass commercialism of Pokemon is hardly the issue here. We've lived through He-Man, Thundercats, Transformers, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and The Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers, with no real scar left on children's entertainment. Pokemon enslaved children in the late nineties because it was a genuinely unique and novel idea. The video game was addictive, the character designs were interesting and the marketing gimmicks of seeing NEW characters were enticing... So what's the problem with Pokemon?Look at the industry when the previous fads hit the airwaves. Children's entertainment was all about milking toys and movies so much that each fad could survive only until the next hit movie or new toy was released. Pokemon wasn't like these previous crazes made to sell a bunch of toys until interest moves onto the next big thing. Pokemon was an institution. They created an entire world of escapism that ended up to be so powerful, not even the release of a film was able to effect its popularity. If you completed the video game, they hooked you onto the card game, and when interest on the card game waned, they released a sequel to the video game, which lead to a new set of cards... They had us working on a loop that would make George Lucas drool.By the time the older fans grew up and caught on, it was too late. The whole industry had taken Pokemon's lead and Japan/Anime-style saturated the market. Digimon, Card Captors, Loonatics Unleashed, Winx Club, and Yu-Gi-Oh are all the obnoxious off-spring to Pokemon that have ruined the fun associated with a craze and have left the soulless commercialism. As I said, Pokemon was a cool idea that just happened to inadvertently cause one of the biggest slumps in children's entertainment that'll take years to get out of.As for the film...

This is not only a movie children will enjoy, but a movie that adults will find has story elements worth following up on.If you're unfamiliar with the basics, Pokemon (short for ""POcKEt MONsters"") are creatures a little like those from this world, but with strange and unusual powers and abilities that they use for their masters - masters that can be either good or evil.  Ash and his friends train their Pokemon to fight battles with their enemies.  They travel all over the planet to collect new and unusual types of Pokemon.  They trap Pokemon in ""Poke Balls"" - a small device that hangs from a belt.  When Ash's enemies release their Pokemon to do their work, Ash and his friends release their Pokemon, and they have a big battle.In the main story, Giovanni, the leader of the evil ""Team Rocket"", uses cells from a prehistoric Pokemon named Mew to create a whole new creature.  But MewTwo is not a true clone - he is manufactured to be better than his 'parent'.  Giovanni wants to control MewTwo for himself, but MewTwo revolts against this, breaks free from his creator and begins a campaign of revenge.  It's up to Ash and his friends to stop MewTwo before he kills everyone on Earth with his scientifically enhanced psychic powers.  MewTwo begins his reign of terror by cloning other Pokemon to be better than their predecessors.It is MewTwo's revolt and its results that can start interesting classroom discussions.  Questions for discussion include:  ""Is Cloning Wrong?""  ""If we do clone, do we want to try to alter the original?""  And, the most interesting dilemmas of all  - ""Is this all I am?""  ""Why am I here?""  ""Where do I go from here?""  These are dilemmas everyone must deal with.I won't spoil the ending - it has to be seen.  Even the original Mew shows up to add to the fun.  The ending caused hours of talk between my daughter and myself.  I gained a whole new respect for Pokemon thru this movie, and I'm sure you will too.  The story's twin messages - one about cloning and its effects and one about ""Is This All I Am?"" are not preachy and the art is Japanamation at close to its best.There's also a short Pikachu cartoon that younger Pokemon fans will enjoy.

So he  manipulates Pokemon Masters onto going to the island, where he can clone  their Pokemons. Then he battles them. Then your fearless heroes come to  save the day, Ash, Brock and Misty. The movie had it's usual supporting  cast; such as the villains Jesse, James and Meowth. The one thing that the  movie didn't have was a variety of Pokemon! It had the usual, like Pikachu,  Charizard, Bulbasaur, but where were some of my favorites like Hitmon Chan,  Diglet and others? I don't even remember seeing Wheezing of Arbok in it! I  even expected to see Ash's rival, Gary Oak, in the movie, but he only had a  very small cameo in it.The movie also included the short film,  &quot;Pikachu's Vacation&quot;. This 20 minute cartoon was far better then  the actual movie itself. It is the main reason why I rated this movie 3  stars instead of 1. I thought it was great! It was funny, exciting and the  music accompanied the different scenes. It introduced new Pokemon, and had  a variety of the old ones. The features on the DVD wasn't that bad also. It  had little shorts like &quot;Ash's Journey&quot;.

118503,A10FHA5E7VEDTW,0790748266,Colin Y.,"[7, 11]","Pokemon is first and foremost an anime. But it's different from the typical anime licensed in America. It is mainstreamed, so that little kids will enjoy it and not get turned off by the Japaneseness that older people like.Most of the time, an anime is released on video or DVD, and so the translators and writers keep in everything from mature themes to the original stories and characters. Then, if it is decided that the anime will be shown on TV, they will censor it and air it.Pokemon is different, they don't dub the original thing, they dub a censored and dumbed down version and air that. What you see on TV and in the theater is the American Producers spin to the original thing.You're not watching Pokemon, you're watching an Americanized version of Pokemon. What's more, the Americanized version is the version that all English-Language countries see, which upsets the poeple not living in America. (i.e. the Minnesota Vikings joke).The Americanization of Pokemon is at an all time high in this movie, the story and dialogue is way off from the original. They even composed an entirely different score. (The new score isn't necissarily bad, but it's the thought that they are taking someone else's work and determining themselves how and that they must change it so that the narrow-minded American children will be able to enjoy it).And so, the movie is terrible.My biggest gripe is the inclusion of evil pop music. Pop music is evil, and no one really seems to know that. If the American version had alternative rock in it, I'd be happier, but that's just my personal opinion.As I mentioned before, the dialogue is dumbed down seriously so that the movie is easier to understand. Exposition in this movie is multiplied by five from the original Japanese version. Another odd thing about the dialogue is that in the original Japanese version, the guy dressed as a pirate that Ash battles in the opening credits speaks English. But the American version dubbed over him anyway. Why? Why do they waste their time? Because they still changed the dialogue. Even in the movie theaters, they still feel that Pokemon must be censored. While in the Japanese version, the character said ""Oh my God!"" in the American version, he says ""Oh no!""The worst translation change is this: in one scene, Mewtwo says ""What's happened here,"" in the Japanese version. In the English version, he says, ""Behold. With pokemon and humans eliminated, the clones shall inherit the world."" Why?Back to the music, while the original score in the dub version is no better than the Japanese version, it's not very bad either. But they decided to add in some vocal tracks to increase their money with deals with record companies. But come on! There is a horrible horrible song called ""Brother, My Brother"" played during a FIGHT SCENE! Sure, the pokemon were fighting clones of each other, but the Japanese version had real symphonic music playing. Battle music. Duel of the Fates sort of thing. But 4Kids decided that they had to endear the parents with some sort of allegorical song so that they'd think their kids would learn something from it.You know, that's all well and sweet and everything, but that sort of thing is for soliloquys at the end of the film, not fight scenes. Movies need to have a kind of artistic value, even ones for young kids. The addition of that song took away the emotion and power of the original scene and replaced it with an advertisement for the singer and a disclaimer to parents.And don't get me started on the pointless M2M song ""Don't Say You Love Me."" No little kid would understand or like that song, and no self-respecting anime watcher would enjoy any pop song at all. It's a song for pubescent girls. Why?That's it really. My only real problem is that the movie is too different from the better Japanese version. They are just too determined to mainstream it. While that's all I can really say about the movie, the bottom line is that it's just plain boring. I'm sure that little kids will love the battles and such, but for older people, it's like sitting there doing nothing.They changed the Pikachu's Vacation movie too. How? You ask. There isn't any dialogue to change. Well, they changed the narrator from a sweet-sounding woman to the Pokedex, and they messed the music up like in the main film.",1,The mainstreaming of Japanese anime at its worst.,1059177600,"07 26, 2003",2003,4319,"['Pokemon', 'first', 'foremost', 'anime', 'different', 'typical', 'anime', 'licensed', 'America', 'mainstreamed', 'little', 'kids', 'will', 'enjoy', 'not', 'get', 'turned', 'off', 'Japaneseness', 'older', 'people', 'like.Most', 'time', 'anime', 'released', 'video', 'DVD', 'so', 'translators', 'writers', 'keep', 'everything', 'mature', 'themes', 'original', 'stories', 'characters', 'Then', 'decided', 'anime', 'will', 'be', 'shown', 'TV', 'will', 'censor', 'air', 'it.Pokemon', 'different', 'do', ""n't"", 'dub', 'original', 'thing', 'dub', 'censored', 'dumbed', 'version', 'air', 'What', 'see', 'TV', 'theater', 'American', 'Producers', 'spin', 'original', 'thing.You', ""'re"", 'not', 'watching', 'Pokemon', ""'re"", 'watching', 'Americanized', 'version', 'Pokemon', 'What', 'more', 'Americanized', 'version', 'version', 'English-Language', 'countries', 'see', 'poeple', 'not', 'living', 'America', 'i.e', 'Minnesota', 'Vikings', 'joke', 'Americanization', 'Pokemon', 'time', 'high', 'movie', 'story', 'dialogue', 'way', 'original', 'even', 'composed', 'entirely', 'different', 'score', 'new', 'score', ""n't"", 'necissarily', 'bad', 'thought', 'are', 'taking', 'someone', 'else', 'work', 'determining', 'how', 'must', 'change', 'so', 'narrow-minded', 'American', 'children', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'so', 'movie', 'terrible.My', 'biggest', 'gripe', 'inclusion', 'evil', 'pop', 'music', 'Pop', 'music', 'evil', 'one', 'really', 'know', 'American', 'version', 'had', 'alternative', 'rock', ""'d"", 'be', 'happier', 'just', 'personal', 'opinion.As', 'mentioned', 'dialogue', 'dumbed', 'down', 'seriously', 'movie', 'easier', 'understand', 'Exposition', 'movie', 'multiplied', 'five', 'original', 'Japanese', 'version', 'odd', 'thing', 'dialogue', 'original', 'Japanese', 'version', 'guy', 'dressed', 'pirate', 'Ash', 'opening', 'credits', 'speaks', 'English', 'American', 'version', 'dubbed', 'anyway', 'Why', 'Why', 'do', 'waste', 'time', 'still', 'changed', 'dialogue', 'Even', 'movie', 'theaters', 'still', 'feel', 'Pokemon', 'must', 'be', 'censored', 'Japanese', 'version', 'character', 'said', 'Oh', 'God', 'American', 'version', 'Oh', 'worst', 'translation', 'change', 'one', 'scene', 'Mewtwo', 'What', 'happened', 'here', 'Japanese', 'version', 'English', 'version', 'Behold', 'pokemon', 'humans', 'eliminated', 'clones', 'shall', 'inherit', 'world', 'Why', 'Back', 'music', 'original', 'score', 'dub', 'version', 'better', 'Japanese', 'version', 'not', 'very', 'bad', 'decided', 'add', 'vocal', 'tracks', 'increase', 'money', 'deals', 'record', 'companies', 'come', 'horrible', 'horrible', 'song', 'called', 'Brother', 'My', 'Brother', 'played', 'FIGHT', 'SCENE', 'Sure', 'pokemon', 'were', 'fighting', 'clones', 'other', 'Japanese', 'version', 'had', 'real', 'symphonic', 'music', 'playing', 'Battle', 'music', 'Duel', 'Fates', 'sort', 'thing', '4Kids', 'decided', 'had', 'endear', 'parents', 'sort', 'allegorical', 'song', 'so', ""'d"", 'think', 'kids', 'would', 'learn', 'something', 'it.You', 'know', 'well', 'sweet', 'everything', 'sort', 'thing', 'soliloquys', 'end', 'film', 'not', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Movies', 'need', 'have', 'kind', 'artistic', 'value', 'even', 'ones', 'young', 'kids', 'addition', 'song', 'took', 'away', 'emotion', 'power', 'original', 'scene', 'replaced', 'advertisement', 'singer', 'disclaimer', 'parents.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'started', 'pointless', 'M2M', 'song', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Say', 'Love', 'Me', 'little', 'kid', 'would', 'understand', 'song', 'self-respecting', 'anime', 'watcher', 'would', 'enjoy', 'pop', 'song', 'song', 'pubescent', 'girls', 'Why', 'really', 'My', 'only', 'real', 'problem', 'movie', 'too', 'different', 'better', 'Japanese', 'version', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'determined', 'mainstream', 'can', 'really', 'say', 'movie', 'bottom', 'line', 'just', 'plain', 'boring', ""'m"", 'sure', 'little', 'kids', 'will', 'love', 'battles', 'such', 'older', 'people', 'sitting', 'there', 'doing', 'nothing.They', 'changed', 'Pikachu', 'Vacation', 'movie', 'too', 'How', 'ask', ""n't"", 'dialogue', 'change', 'Well', 'changed', 'narrator', 'sweet-sounding', 'woman', 'Pokedex', 'messed', 'music', 'up', 'main', 'film']",Pokémon: The First Movie VHS

118514,AY5XWJE0LEYB8,0790748266,jasmine garcia,"[1, 1]","The Pok&eacute;mon Mewtwo was created in an island laboratory from the DNA of Mew, a rare Pok&eacute;mon believed to be extinct, recovered from fossilized remains. Displeased with the concept of being nothing more than a mere lab experiment, Mewtwo destroys the laboratory.[2] Shortly afterward, he meets Giovanni, the head of Team Rocket, who proposes a partnership with the Pok&eacute;mon in exchange of helping it control its powers. Mewtwo is ""trained"" over the next few months, being pitted against challengers in Giovanni's gym and restraining Pok&eacute;mon for Team Rocket to capture. Mewtwo eventually realizes that Giovanni is merely using him as a tool and destroys his headquarters. Mewtwo flies back to the island where it was created and begins plotting revenge against humanity.Meanwhile, Ash Ketchum and his friends Misty, Brock, Pikachu, and all their Pok&eacute;mon companions receive an invitation to a party hosted by the world's ""greatest Pok&eacute;mon Master"" on New Island. Ash and his friends are excited and rush to the docks in an attempt to catch a boat to New Island, but a storm is mysteriously formed and all boat rides to the island are canceled. Undeterred, several trainers make their way out to the island by riding their Pok&eacute;mon, though neither Ash nor his friends have any Pok&eacute;mon of their own that can help them safely navigate the stormy sea. In their latest plot to steal rare Pok&eacute;mon, Team Rocket offers the trio a lift to the island, disguised as a pair of Vikings, but their small wooden boat is destroyed by a wave. Ash and his friends manage to reach the island with their aquatic Pok&eacute;mon, and are escorted inside the palace on the island.Mewtwo reveals itself to Ash, his friends, and three other trainers who braved the storm battle as the ""World's Greatest Pok&eacute;mon Master,"" and that it had created the storm with its powers to test the trainers' wills. After being berated by Mewtwo for the relationships they share with their Pok&eacute;mon, Ash and some of the other trainers challenge Mewtwo after witnessing Mewtwo's confession of having kidnapped Nurse Joy for his own personal purposes, the trainers pit their Pok&eacute;mon against clones of Venusaur, Blastoise, and Charizard. The clones easily defeat the trainers' Pok&eacute;mon. Mewtwo proceeds to steal all the Pok&eacute;mon present, including Ash's Pikachu, with a special set of Pok&eacute; Balls. Ash pursues his Pok&eacute;mon as they are taken deep into a cloning facility on the island and rescues them while they are being cloned. The clones join with Mewtwo and the cloning machine explodes, releasing all the captured Pok&eacute;mon. Mewtwo announces its intentions to overthrow humanity with its army of Pok&eacute;mon and rule the world. Enraged, Ash lashes out at Mewtwo, who repels and blasts him away with its psychic powers. Ash is saved by Mew, the rare, playful Pok&eacute;mon having appeared periodically before, who is engaged by Mewtwo. A brutal battle between the trainers' Pok&eacute;mon and their clones erupts, although Pikachu refuses to fight with its own clone (Meowth's clone also seems to refuse to fight, causing the original Meowth to ponder on what the two sides have in common).The trainers are unable to bear this senseless violence, even while the two sides grow fatigued and Mew and Mewtwo continue fighting. In an attempt to put an end to the ordeal, Mew and Mewtwo sum up all their remaining powers for one final duel. As they open fire however, Ash runs to the center of the arena in a brave but desperate attempt to stop the fight. Ash is turned into stone in the attack, and he collapses in the center of the arena. Pikachu runs to the side of its now-deceased trainer. After trying to get him off the floor, Pikachu attempts again using Thunderbolt, but in vain. In its grief, Pikachu starts crying for its fallen master, the other Pok&eacute;mon in the arena doing the same. The magical tears reach Ash, their magical healing and caring powers in their hearts reviving him. As everyone rejoices, Mewtwo and mew, taken aback by Ash's act of selflessness to save all the Pok&eacute;mon, has an epiphany over the relationship, love and caring between humans and Pok&eacute;mon, and they realizes that the circumstances and great love and caring in their hearts of how one is born should not be allowed to divide anyone and he discovered that he has great love and caring in everyone's hearts. even mew and himself. So It leaves the island with Mew and the cloned Pok&eacute;mon, erasing everyone else's memory of the horrifying incident, knowing it is for the best and it showed that in their hearts, they have to show someone they do care with love and caring in their hearts.Ash and his friends find themselves back on the docks with no idea how they got there. Ash looks up to the sky and spots Mew flying past, and recounts to his friends how he saw a rare Pok&eacute;mon on the first day of his journey.",5,the legend of mewtwo.,1343347200,"07 27,

Over the duration of the 20-minute short, they have a run-in with border-ruffian Pokemon, and hilarity ensues.The film itself tells the story of Mewtwo, a Pokemon created from DNA of Mew (a Legendary Pokemon).  After feeling betrayed by humans, Mewtwo creates a group of cloned Pokemon, which Mewtwo intends to use to eradicate humans and their Pokemon.  He then would repopulate the world with his clone Pokemon.  It's up to Ash and friends to save the day.The DVD contains a few bonus features.  First, there's one labeled ""Behind-the-Scenes,"" which is just twelve pages of text that explain the origins of Pokemon in Japan and the United States, as well as explains the concept behind Pokemon.There is also a version of the film on the DVD that contains commentary form Michael Haigney (the director) and Norman J. Grossfield (the producer).The music video for M2M's ""Don't Say You Love Me"" is also a bonus feature (this was promoted as a single from the soundtrack for Pokemon The First Movie).  You can also see the theatrical trailer for Pokemon The First Movie, as well as a preview of Pokemon The Movie 2000.  There's also a piece labeled ""Ash's Journey,"" which is narrated by Brock and lasts about a minute-and-a-half.I would highly recommend Pokemon The First Movie be in the DVD collection of any Pokemon fan.",4,The first film for the Pokemon franchise,1207180800,"04 3, 2008",2008,1529,"['DVD', 'Pokemon', 'First', 'Movie', 'as', 'well', 'short', 'Pikachu', 'Vacation', 'Pikachu', 'Vacation', 'story', 'Ash', 'Misty', 'Brock', 'Pokemon', 'going', 'vacation', 'spot', 'specifically', 'Pokemon', 'duration', '20-minute', 'short', 'have', 'run-in', 'border-ruffian', 'Pokemon', 'hilarity', 'ensues.The', 'film', 'story', 'Mewtwo', 'Pokemon', 'created', 'DNA', 'Mew', 'Legendary', 'Pokemon', 'feeling', 'betrayed', 'humans', 'Mewtwo', 'group', 'cloned', 'Pokemon', 'Mewtwo', 'use', 'eradicate', 'humans', 'Pokemon', 'then', 'would', 'repopulate', 'world', 'clone', 'Pokemon', 'up', 'Ash', 'friends', 'save', 'day.The', 'DVD', 'few', 'bonus', 'features', 'First', 'one', 'labeled', 'Behind-the-Scenes', 'just', 'twelve', 'pages', 'text', 'explain', 'origins', 'Pokemon', 'Japan', 'United', 'States', 'as', 'well', 'explains', 'concept', 'Pokemon.There', 'also', 'version', 'film', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'form', 'Michael', 'Haigney', 'director', 'Norman', 'J.', 'Grossfield', 'producer', '.The', 'music', 'video', 'M2M', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Say', 'Love', 'Me', 'also', 'bonus', 'feature', 'was', 'promoted', 'single', 'soundtrack', 'Pokemon', 'First', 'Movie', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'Pokemon', 'First', 'Movie', 'as', 'well', 'preview', 'Pokemon', 'Movie', '2000', 'also', 'piece', 'labeled', 'Ash', 'Journey', 'narrated', 'Brock', 'minute-and-a-half.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Pokemon', 'First', 'Movie', 'be', 'DVD', 'collection', 'Pokemon', 'fan']",Pokémon: The First Movie VHS

Pok&eacute;mon's first showing on the big screen seems to have passed the quality checks of most US and UK  fans, and its success in other countries has undoubtedly been similar.  However, I was quite disappointed by the English dub (by now a very common  point of criticism). The dialog, compared with the original Japanese,  has  been butchered, which I find very annoying. A prime example of this is  actually from the second Pok&eacute;mon movie, Pok&eacute;mon The Movie 2000, where, in  the Japanese version, a character says &quot;this is serious...&quot; and  in the English dub says &quot;I wish I had some pants...&quot;!The  &quot;Americanisation&quot; of anime is something that has irritated true  fans of Pok&eacute;mon, and although the producers and writers at Kids WB and  4Kids seem to think it necessary, I can assure you, it isn't! What the fans  would like to see is the original anime, without the retouching done by US  corporations. Thankfully, we still get to see the original anime, due to  the efforts of The Pikachu Project and Fans 4 Fans, and because of the fact  that neither Kids WB, 4 Kids or Nintendo of America hold the Japanese  copyrights on Pok&eacute;mon...One thing in the movie's favour is that the  animation has been greatly enhanced, so that the 3D rendering of objects  such as the double doors leading into Mewtwo's castle and The Flight of  Dragonite at the beginning of the movie.So, overall: this film has  whetted my appetite with regards to Pok&eacute;mon-based movies, but in the  future, more adherance to the original script would be apprecited.",4,The original Japanese version was much better...,965952000,"08 11, 2000",2000,1647,"['was', 'quite', 'pleased', 'film', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'mon', 'first', 'showing', 'big', 'screen', 'have', 'passed', 'quality', 'checks', 'most', 'US', 'UK', 'fans', 'success', 'other', 'countries', 'undoubtedly', 'been', 'similar', 'However', 'was', 'quite', 'disappointed', 'English', 'dub', 'now', 'very', 'common', 'point', 'criticism', 'dialog', 'compared', 'original', 'Japanese', 'been', 'butchered', 'find', 'very', 'annoying', 'prime', 'example', 'actually', 'second', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'mon', 'movie', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'Movie', '2000', 'where', 'Japanese', 'version', 'character', 'quot', 'serious', 'quot', 'English', 'dub', 'quot', 'wish', 'had', 'pants', 'quot', 'quot', 'Americanisation', 'quot', 'anime', 'something', 'irritated', 'true', 'fans', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'producers', 'writers', 'Kids', 'WB', '4Kids', 'seem', 'think', 'necessary', 'can', 'assure', ""n't"", 'What', 'fans', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'original', 'anime', 'retouching', 'done', 'US', 'corporations', 'Thankfully', 'still', 'get', 'see', 'original', 'anime', 'due', 'efforts', 'Pikachu', 'Project', 'Fans', '4', 'Fans', 'fact', 'Kids', 'WB', '4', 'Kids', 'Nintendo', 'America', 'hold', 'Japanese', 'copyrights', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'One', 'thing', 'movie', 'favour', 'animation', 'been', 'greatly', 'enhanced', '3D', 'rendering', 'objects', 'such', 'double', 'doors', 'leading', 'Mewtwo', 'castle', 'Flight', 'Dragonite', 'beginning', 'movie.So', 'overall', 'film', 'whetted', 'appetite', 'regards', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'mon-based', 'movies', 'future', 'more', 'adherance', 'original', 'script', 'would', 'be', 'apprecited']",Pokémon: The First Movie VHS

No, I'm not the kind of person who thinks Pokemon are  creations of the devil or whatever nonsense they're saying these days. I  like the cartoon. I find it charming. Unfortunately, some things should  just stay as a cartoon series. The animation style of the series is so  wretched that it couldn't possibly look good in a full blown movie.  Pikachu's Vacation is cute, but it's incomprehensible and horridly strange.  The main movie itself is slow, boring, and inane. It also rudely  jackhammers its message into your poor brain. The soundtrack? Dumb. More  excuses to show off pop sensations. All in all, I really don't care if this  movie is entertaining to Pokemon fans. That's not enough for me or for  those who aren't.

The script was re-written in a way to make it more dramatic and was given several morals.  I thought this was okay, but I think that the original  script shouldn't be tampered with.  I also thought that the re-composition  of the background music was pretty good too, although I don't know why  4Kids would waste their time doing it.  There were cuts in Mewtwo's Origin  and Pikachu's Vacation, but that's really no big deal.  I think that  Mewtwo's voice sounded a bit odd compared to the Japanese, for in Japanese,  he sounded like he had a robotic voice, which really made him feel creepy.  There were also some Pok&eacute;mon mistakes.  There was a Pidgeot called  Pidgeotto, a Scyther called Alakazam and a Sandslash called Sandshrew.  I  honestly think that 4Kids should have taken a better look at this.If you  take away all of those problems, this movie was great.  The added CGI  effects really made this movie look neat in theatres, and it still does  here.

The main character in the animated series is Ash Ketchum, a brash young trainer, whose pet, Pikachu - a cute, mouse-like animal that shoots electricity - has become the unoffical mascot of the Pokemon universe.In Pokemon: The First Movie, Ash, Pikachu and their friends are lured to New Island tocompete in the greatest competition in the world. Their host is Mewtwo, a sort of mouthless flying kitten. Angry over his creation, Mewtwo plans to wipe out all humans and Pokemons off the face of this Earth, using clones of the visting Pokemon. The result is a series of protracted battles between clones and original, before Ash and his crew finally save the day.Whether the movie actually suceeds or not is difficult to say.

I have not seen the Japanese version, although I may soon, but I think that it was a far better movie than most  people realize.  For instance in the last battle scene when Misty mentions  about how meaningless the battle was, she was referring to the fight to the  death of the Pokemon.  Pokemon enjoying fighting, not killing.  That's the  difference between the fighting that they do with the trainers and the  fighting they were doing with their superpokemon clones.  Mewtwo was pretty  threatening in his own way, and his anger was portrayed very well by the  voice actor.  While some of the names weren't the best choices, I wasn't  really interested in the nicknames that they chose.  Ash's 'death' was  quite well done, and I thought that the music was excellent.  With Mew's  scenes it was really cute and fun.  It's not a movie for everyone, but it  is a movie for those who enjoy being entertained.

The new composed  music that replaced the nifty-spiffy creepy pipe organ music (Mewtwo's  theme) was so depressing that i wanted to throw up.Yes, Shogakukan  digitized some sections for the US release, and that was rather neat, but  to hack apart a wonderful entertaining movie was just wrong.The kids  will rave, but older Pok&eacute;mon fans like myself will find it frustrating and  rather dull.

118544,A20JS9ESUZWU9Y,0790748266,Ren Culpepper,"[6, 7]","Mewtwo Strikes Back is, in my opinion, one of the best movies in existence, and not just because it has Pokemon in it.  The plot, dialogue and especially the art were all very interesting.  This movie has received a lot of hostility from people, but it's usually for the following reasons:1. They dislike Pokemon, anime, or something along those lines.2. They take cartoon violence way too seriously.3. They just don't like the English version, because it is apparently evil and horrible and wrong for the English-speaking scriptwriters to write what they WANT, instead of conforming to the original script.The movie is in fact, like I said, really, really, really, really good.  The plot involves a team of scientists making a clone of Mew, the rarest and most powerful Pokemon to have ever existed, after finding its eyelash (I think) in the Amazon.  However, they attempt to make the clone much more powerful than its genetic ancestor.  After developing in a gargantuan test tube for quite some time, Mewtwo is born.Unlike most Pokemon, Mewtwo can actually speak human speech instead of just saying its name (this is most likely because the movie would be rather confusing otherwise).  Mewtwo quickly realises he is being used by the scientists, and so he blows up the lab.  It is at this point that the dastardly boss of Team Rocket, Giovanni, shows up and wheedles Mewtwo into a partnership with him.However, after some time, Giovanni informs Mewtwo he isn't actually his equal and was created solely to obey humans.  Mewtwo is of course upset about this, so he blows up Giovanni's hideout and goes on his own.Sometime later, Ash, Misty, and Brock are lured into a trap, along with some other trainers, via an invitation to battle ""the world's greatest Pokemon master"".  Mew, somehow sensing that it is needed, also goes to Mewtwo's hideout.Mewtwo ends up cloning their Pokemon, rather like the scientists who created him, and a great battle ensues between the normal Pokemon and the super-clones, not to mention between Mewtwo and Mew.In short, this movie is in fact really good, despite the bad reviews it tends to get.  I'm not sure I'd recommend it for especially young or sensitive children, though, because there are certain amounts of violence in it, but no one dies or anything.Well, actually, Ash gets turned to stone, but he comes back to life after a few minutes, being the main character and all, and it's supposed to tie in with something someone said earlier on in the movie.",5,"A Masterpiece, In Its Own Weird Way",1124323200,"08 18, 2005",2005,2494,"['Mewtwo', 'Strikes', 'Back', 'opinion', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'existence', 'not', 'just', 'Pokemon', 'plot', 'dialogue', 'especially', 'art', 'were', 'very', 'interesting', 'movie', 'received', 'lot', 'hostility', 'people', 'usually', 'following', 'reasons:1', 'dislike', 'Pokemon', 'anime', 'something', 'lines.2', 'take', 'cartoon', 'violence', 'way', 'too', 'seriously.3', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'English', 'version', 'apparently', 'evil', 'horrible', 'wrong', 'English-speaking', 'scriptwriters', 'write', 'what', 'WANT', 'instead', 'conforming', 'original', 'script.The', 'movie', 'fact', 'said', 'really', 'really', 'really', 'really', 'good', 'plot', 'team', 'scientists', 'making', 'clone', 'Mew', 'rarest', 'most', 'powerful', 'Pokemon', 'have', 'ever', 'existed', 'finding', 'eyelash', 'think', 'Amazon', 'However', 'attempt', 'make', 'clone', 'much', 'more', 'powerful', 'genetic', 'ancestor', 'developing', 'gargantuan', 'test', 'tube', 'quite', 'time', 'Mewtwo', 'most', 'Pokemon', 'Mewtwo', 'can', 'actually', 'speak', 'human', 'speech', 'instead', 'just', 'saying', 'name', 'most', 'likely', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'rather', 'confusing', 'otherwise', 'Mewtwo', 'quickly', 'being', 'used', 'scientists', 'so', 'up', 'lab', 'point', 'dastardly', 'boss', 'Team', 'Rocket', 'Giovanni', 'up', 'wheedles', 'Mewtwo', 'partnership', 'him.However', 'time', 'Giovanni', 'Mewtwo', ""n't"", 'actually', 'equal', 'was', 'created', 'solely', 'obey', 'humans', 'Mewtwo', 'course', 'upset', 'up', 'Giovanni', 'hideout', 'own.Sometime', 'later', 'Ash', 'Misty', 'Brock', 'are', 'lured', 'trap', 'other', 'trainers', 'invitation', 'battle', 'world', 'greatest', 'Pokemon', 'master', 'Mew', 'somehow', 'sensing', 'needed', 'also', 'Mewtwo', 'hideout.Mewtwo', 'up', 'cloning', 'Pokemon', 'rather', 'scientists', 'who', 'created', 'great', 'battle', 'ensues', 'normal', 'Pokemon', 'super-clones', 'not', 'mention', 'Mewtwo', 'Mew.In', 'short', 'movie', 'fact', 'really', 'good', 'bad', 'reviews', 'get', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'especially', 'young', 'sensitive', 'children', 'though', 'are', 'certain', 'amounts', 'violence', 'one', 'anything.Well', 'actually', 'Ash', 'turned', 'stone', 'back', 'life', 'few', 'minutes', 'being', 'main', 'character', 'supposed', 'tie', 'something', 'someone', 'said', 'earlier', 'movie']",Pokémon: The First Movie VHS

I've seen snatches of it over the years, but never actually sat down to watch the full movie until now. Odd. I remember when it came out that at least one critic called it the worst movie of the year and said it was nothing more than an extended commercial for the game. I always found that rather amusing, given that many animated movies are commercials for something or other. The critics loved Brother Bear, didn't they? (Well, except me.) It's an extended PETA commercial.That said, there are a lot of reasons not to like this movie, though it seems the main reason (the long, completely unsubtle ""fighting is evil"" sequence towards the end) exists only in its American version. It's annoying, but not really much more so than any of the godawful ""the moral of the story is..."" bits in Pokemon TV episodes.Which is my chief complaint (though I can't really call it a reason not to like the movie) about Mewtwo Strikes Back; it's an extended episode of the show. Thus, if you like the show, you'll probably like the movie, and if you don't, you probably won't. This, however, begs the question: if you don't like the Pokemon TV show, why are you watching the movie? Just curious.It could have been better, but it certainly could have been worse.

That is, in the Japanese version. The first [thing] that 4Kids did to Mewtwo Strikes Back was changing the beautiful and haunting orchestral score that was in the Japanese version. Instead, they added in their own little MIDI track, which isn't SO bad compared to their later work on future projects, but that's not saying much.The next thing they did wrong was altering Mewtwo's personality somewhat. Instead of the soul-searching, philosophical Mewtwo that pondered it's existence in the Japanese version, we now get a ""I am the most powerful Pokemon ever! Fear me and my great power!"" Mewtwo in the English version. Plus, the English voice actor that does Mewtwo's voice doesn't sound quite as threatening or frightening as he did in the japanese version, but at least he did OKAY.The only thing 4Kids did right was paying the japanese Pokemon animation studio, Shogakukan, to re-animate a few scenes to make them look better.Anyway, on this DVD we get a bit of extras, including the never before seen 'World of Pokemon' segment which introduces people to, what else? Pokemon.We also get to see the short film, Pikachu's Vacation, which is VERY silly and Loony Tunes-esque(Heck, 4Kids redid the music to make it sound JUST like a Bugs Bunny cartoon!). 4Kids made some changes, but they weren't as major as the ones they did to the main film.There's also a 'Origin of Mewtwo' segment which is quite lacking, considering that we only get to see LESS THAN A HALF of the whole thing! (Luckily they released the 'uncut' version on the Mewtwo Returns DVD)There's some other stuff on this DVD too, like a directors commentary that isn't very informative, a music video of M2M(which, along with the song that's in the movie, has nothing REMOTELY close in common with this movie), and a trailer for the 2nd Pokemon movie.But one question left is: Why didn't they put the japanese version on here?

The Japanese version is almost an entirely different movie. It's just a shame 4Kids Entertainment will do anything to keep you from seeing it. Although the main characters don't really evolve in character (what to you expect from a movie based on an anime that's been running for almost 10 years) the characters show their emotions more than they do in the T.V. show. If there is one thing positive about this trash of a dub it's that the new music isn't all that bad. However there was nothing wrong with the original music. It sounded just as good, it wasn't so overdramatic, and there also wasn't a million pop songs that had nothing to do with the movie playing in the backround. There's also another important difference between the English and Japanese cut. The most recent Japanese cut that was released before this version was about 12 minutes longer. Some of it can be seen on the American videos. One of the scenes cut plays after Pikachu's Vacation and another can be found in the Extras section of Mewtwo Returns. Anyway, do yourself a favor and try to ignore the hippie, tree hugging, cracked out English diolgue as much as possibe because other than that the movie is very good.

118551,A6UGTB17P5BX8,0790748266,Simon Gifford,"[4, 6]","I wasn`t sure what to expect when I saw this. This feature is actually made up of two movies - the short &quot;Pikachu`s Vacation&quot; and the slightly longer &quot;Mewtwo Strikes Back&quot;. In &quot;Pikachu`s  Vacation&quot; Ash and the gang take their Pokemon for a holiday on an  island. Its cute but strange, made up almost entirely of the Pokemon  speaking their own special language.The premier feature ""Mewtwo Strikes  Back"" is very different. I thought this was far darker and more emotional  than usual, and it freaked some people out who were expecting a kids`  cartoon. The story is that Mewtwo - a new breed of Pokemon (created from  the DNA of an extremely rare Pokemon called Mew), and designed by a group  of scientists to be the most powerful fighter the world has ever seen,  breaks away from his human masters and opts for world domination, creating  a race of genetically engineered Super Pokemon. Needless to say - Ash and  the others come to try to beat Mewtwo and save the world.While this  wasn`t the worst movie I`ve ever seen, it could have been better. The  American dubbing is crude and Mewtwo`s character is awful. In the original  Japanese version, Mewtwo acted the way he did because he was lost and  confused - in America his character is a simple villain who is evil just  for the sake of being evil. The soundtrack also stinks - the excellent  music of the TV show is replaced with god-awful chart pop which has nothing  to do with the movie.Overall this movie was not bad, but not great. I  hope the English writers do a better job with Pokemon The Movie 2000.",3,Good - but not great,963360000,"07 12, 2000",2000,1596,"['wasn', 't', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'saw', 'feature', 'actually', 'made', 'two', 'movies', 'short', 'quot', 'Pikachu', 's', 'Vacation', 'quot', 'slightly', 'longer', 'quot', 'Mewtwo', 'Strikes', 'Back', 'quot', 'quot', 'Pikachu', 's', 'Vacation', 'quot', 'Ash', 'gang', 'take', 'Pokemon', 'holiday', 'island', 'cute', 'strange', 'made', 'up', 'almost', 'entirely', 'Pokemon', 'speaking', 'own', 'special', 'language.The', 'premier', 'feature', 'Mewtwo', 'Strikes', 'Back', 'very', 'different', 'thought', 'was', 'far', 'darker', 'more', 'emotional', 'usual', 'freaked', 'people', 'out', 'who', 'were', 'expecting', 'kids', 'cartoon', 'story', 'Mewtwo', 'new', 'breed', 'Pokemon', 'created', 'DNA', 'extremely', 'rare', 'Pokemon', 'called', 'Mew', 'designed', 'group', 'scientists', 'be', 'most', 'powerful', 'fighter', 'world', 'ever', 'seen', 'breaks', 'away', 'human', 'masters', 'opts', 'world', 'domination', 'creating', 'race', 'genetically', 'engineered', 'Super', 'Pokemon', 'Needless', 'say', 'Ash', 'others', 'come', 'try', 'beat', 'Mewtwo', 'save', 'world.While', 'wasn', 't', 'worst', 'movie', 've', 'ever', 'seen', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'American', 'dubbing', 'crude', 'Mewtwo', 's', 'character', 'awful', 'original', 'Japanese', 'version', 'Mewtwo', 'acted', 'way', 'did', 'was', 'lost', 'confused', 'America', 'character', 'simple', 'villain', 'who', 'evil', 'just', 'sake', 'being', 'evil', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'excellent', 'music', 'TV', 'show', 'replaced', 'god-awful', 'chart', 'pop', 'nothing', 'do', 'movie.Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'great', 'hope', 'English', 'writers', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'Pokemon', 'Movie', '2000']",Pokémon: The First Movie VHS

Pokemon the first movie is is basically an extension of the series with little effort otherwise.Pokemon the first movie is about Assh, Misty, Brock and a few other trainers lured to a mysteriouse Island to battle a mystery trainer.  The trainer turns out to be Mewtwo hell bent on on destroying the world.  With each pokemon defeated he clones them to increase his army.  The trainers fight back with the help of Mew to defeate Mewtwo.This basically tries to create a compelling movie but instead makes an extension of the series.
