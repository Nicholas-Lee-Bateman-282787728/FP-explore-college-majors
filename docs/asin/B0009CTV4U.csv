903816,AOW7M9ULF0JND,B0009CTV4U,Alec Martin,"[3, 5]","Ren and Stimpy is quite possibly THE saddest cartoon show in animation history. Ren and Stimpy has been bulldozed over by children's network, Nickelodeon, with horrific censors. The first two seasons are quite possibly the greatest cartoons of all time. When John K, the creator, left after the second season, things were never the same. Ren and Stimpy went from an enjoyable, very laugh-worthy crowning achievement in television, to a torpid, raving mess, from the finest animation of that time, to a forgettable, monotonous excuse.It seems that the third season was the last season to ever stay strong, and this set features Season Three. And most of Season Three is watchable.After going through multiple VHS tapes, DVD releases from Timelife and the last 'Seasons One and Two' set, with long and exhausting promises of being 'Uncut', guess what? After an entire air on Spike TV, a newly released set, and a previously released 'One-and-a-Half Seasons' from Timelife, guess what?Ren and Stimpy STILL isn't uncut.In fact, the problems are even more so worse in this set. Examples:Road Apples:Mr. and Mrs. Pipe telling about the Psychotic Killer story (1 min 42 sec)A shot of Ren getting eating by the vulture (9 sec)Lair of the Lummox:The 'Colonel Backwash's Chicken in a Drawer' bumper (over 3-4 min)Jimminy Lummox:Ren pulling a prank on Stimpy: blowing up his butt with an atom bomb (about 14 sec)Ren dumping crabs in Stimpy's bath (25 sec)Ren's Retirement:""Hear that, Ren? We still got 17 more holes to go!"" (5 sec)Hermit Ren:Ren running down the hall, screaming at Stimpy into his bedroom (6 sec)I Love Chicken:Stimpy serving Ren giblets (18 sec)A Hard Day's Luck:The Entire Bus Change sequence (1 min 4 sec)---And that's just to name a few. There's a hell of a lot more. And even the 'Uncut' episodes have suffered major problems, when random commercial fades come about, and a lot of dot crawl is present. Not to mention bad digital remastering, and that sometimes takes little bits (usually 1 sec) of animation with it.And yet, some of these moments that ARE cut make the cartoons even less tolerable, considering that some of these moments are better than the cartoon itself. It seems that Nickelodeon had not fully prepared uncut protection masters, is this correct? And, believe it or not, the Season 5 set is also cut.So an exhaustively cut set, making some average episodes seem more stupid due to the censors, and rushed production values, make something arguably not worth your time.For the good episodes on here, not to mention the rather informative commentaries, it's MAYBE worth a rental from Netflix. And, if it's a breather: this set doesn't truly get bad until the third disk. It's just that the ignorance of the whole set, both visually, tonally, and production-wise, may not exactly seem worth your money. A normal Spongebob episode today seems a hell of a lot better than what this can offer. Ren and Stimpy has been forgotten, and it shows.",3,A decent package assaulted with annoying censorship and mangled production.,1298592000,"02 25, 2011",2011,2967,"['Ren', 'Stimpy', 'quite', 'possibly', 'THE', 'saddest', 'cartoon', 'show', 'animation', 'history', 'Ren', 'Stimpy', 'been', 'bulldozed', 'children', 'network', 'Nickelodeon', 'horrific', 'censors', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'are', 'quite', 'possibly', 'greatest', 'cartoons', 'time', 'When', 'John', 'K', 'creator', 'left', 'second', 'season', 'things', 'were', 'never', 'same', 'Ren', 'Stimpy', 'went', 'enjoyable', 'very', 'laugh-worthy', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'television', 'torpid', 'raving', 'mess', 'finest', 'animation', 'time', 'forgettable', 'monotonous', 'excuse.It', 'third', 'season', 'was', 'last', 'season', 'ever', 'stay', 'strong', 'set', 'Season', 'Three', 'most', 'Season', 'Three', 'watchable.After', 'going', 'multiple', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'DVD', 'Timelife', 'last', ""'Seasons"", 'One', 'Two', 'set', 'long', 'exhausting', 'promises', 'being', ""'Uncut"", 'guess', 'what', 'entire', 'air', 'Spike', 'TV', 'newly', 'released', 'set', 'previously', 'released', ""'One-and-a-Half"", 'Seasons', 'Timelife', 'guess', 'what', 'Ren', 'Stimpy', 'STILL', ""n't"", 'uncut.In', 'fact', 'problems', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'worse', 'set', 'Examples', 'Road', 'Apples', 'Mr.', 'Mrs', 'Pipe', 'telling', 'Psychotic', 'Killer', 'story', '1', 'min', '42', 'sec', 'shot', 'Ren', 'getting', 'eating', 'vulture', '9', 'sec', 'Lair', 'Lummox', ""'Colonel"", 'Backwash', 'Chicken', 'Drawer', 'bumper', '3-4', 'min', 'Jimminy', 'Lummox', 'Ren', 'pulling', 'prank', 'Stimpy', 'blowing', 'up', 'butt', 'atom', 'bomb', '14', 'sec', 'Ren', 'dumping', 'crabs', 'Stimpy', 'bath', '25', 'sec', 'Ren', 'Retirement', 'Hear', 'Ren', 'still', 'got', '17', 'more', 'holes', 'go', '5', 'sec', 'Hermit', 'Ren', 'Ren', 'running', 'down', 'hall', 'screaming', 'Stimpy', 'bedroom', '6', 'sec', 'Love', 'Chicken', 'Stimpy', 'serving', 'Ren', 'giblets', '18', 'sec', 'Hard', 'Day', 'Luck', 'Entire', 'Bus', 'Change', 'sequence', '1', 'min', '4', 'sec', '-And', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'hell', 'lot', 'more', 'even', ""'Uncut"", 'episodes', 'have', 'suffered', 'major', 'problems', 'when', 'random', 'commercial', 'fades', 'come', 'lot', 'dot', 'crawl', 'present', 'Not', 'mention', 'bad', 'digital', 'remastering', 'sometimes', 'little', 'bits', 'usually', '1', 'sec', 'animation', 'it.And', 'yet', 'moments', 'ARE', 'cut', 'make', 'cartoons', 'even', 'less', 'tolerable', 'considering', 'moments', 'are', 'better', 'cartoon', 'Nickelodeon', 'had', 'not', 'fully', 'prepared', 'uncut', 'protection', 'masters', 'correct', 'believe', 'not', 'Season', '5', 'set', 'also', 'cut.So', 'exhaustively', 'cut', 'set', 'making', 'average', 'episodes', 'seem', 'more', 'stupid', 'due', 'censors', 'rushed', 'production', 'values', 'make', 'something', 'arguably', 'not', 'time.For', 'good', 'episodes', 'here', 'not', 'mention', 'rather', 'informative', 'commentaries', 'MAYBE', 'rental', 'Netflix', 'breather', 'set', ""n't"", 'truly', 'get', 'bad', 'third', 'disk', 'just', 'ignorance', 'whole', 'set', 'visually', 'tonally', 'production-wise', 'may', 'not', 'exactly', 'seem', 'worth', 'money', 'normal', 'Spongebob', 'episode', 'today', 'hell', 'lot', 'better', 'what', 'can', 'offer', 'Ren', 'Stimpy', 'been', 'forgotten']",The Ren and Stimpy Show - Seasons Three and a Half-ish

903818,A21XZF5ZHKK5EM,B0009CTV4U,"Antoinette Johnson ""Pooky""","[1, 1]","This was the first Ren and Stimpy box set I ever got. I saw episode I've never seen before. As said in my Season 1 and 2 review, Ren and Stimpy is an old 90's cartoon that aired on Nickolodian. It was way ahead of its time. It was gross, borderline offensive, and one of the best cartoons ever! It had the audacity to go where many kids cartoons of the time rarely touched. with the exception of Rockos Modern Life and a few other shows Ren and Stimpy had sexual innuendos that went over most of our little heads. It was often violent, cruel, but funny as all hell. It was one of those controversial shows that put parents panties in a buntch. As an 18 year old the fact that I never noticed some of the hidden innuendo in this show makes it even more funny. The fact that it wasn't the type of show that talks down to kids is an added plus. Some times I wonder how far Billy West, John K. and the other peaple who worked on the show would have went without Nicks restrictions and cencorship. Season 3 and a halfish didn't disappoint that much. This box set has some of my favorite episodes like A Yard Too Far, Jerry the Bellybutton elf, and Lair of the Lummux. In the commentary the makers said that originally there was going to be a farting contest in that episode, which feeds my curiousity even more to how far this show could have gone. I was a little disappointed that certain episodes weren't commentaried. Its actually very interesting hearing where the ideas came from. I noticed something strange though. By the 3rd disc With the exception of Farm Hands and some other ones, the episodes became kind of dull and forgettable. From reviews I've read its due to the original workers for the show being fired and replaced by peaple chosen by Nick to make part of the 4th season in this box set. That makes sense. I mean it felt like compared to the episodes of the 1st box set and first two disc, they were holding back and less bold. It was kind of disappointing in that aspect. Other than that if you're a huge fan of Ren and Stimpy this is worth having at least for the more ballsy and extreme episodes early on. Its worth a buy.",4,Nolstagia.,1284681600,"09 17, 2010",2010,2140,"['was', 'first', 'Ren', 'Stimpy', 'box', 'set', 'ever', 'got', 'saw', 'episode', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'said', 'Season', '1', '2', 'review', 'Ren', 'Stimpy', 'old', '90', 'cartoon', 'aired', 'Nickolodian', 'was', 'way', 'ahead', 'time', 'was', 'gross', 'borderline', 'offensive', 'one', 'best', 'cartoons', 'ever', 'had', 'audacity', 'go', 'where', 'many', 'kids', 'cartoons', 'time', 'rarely', 'touched', 'exception', 'Rockos', 'Modern', 'Life', 'few', 'other', 'shows', 'Ren', 'Stimpy', 'had', 'sexual', 'innuendos', 'went', 'most', 'little', 'heads', 'was', 'often', 'violent', 'cruel', 'funny', 'hell', 'was', 'one', 'controversial', 'shows', 'put', 'parents', 'panties', 'buntch', '18', 'year', 'old', 'fact', 'never', 'noticed', 'hidden', 'innuendo', 'show', 'even', 'more', 'funny', 'fact', 'was', ""n't"", 'type', 'show', 'down', 'kids', 'added', 'plus', 'times', 'wonder', 'how', 'far', 'Billy', 'West', 'John', 'K.', 'other', 'peaple', 'who', 'worked', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'went', 'Nicks', 'restrictions', 'cencorship', 'Season', '3', 'halfish', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'that', 'much', 'box', 'set', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'Yard', 'Too', 'Far', 'Jerry', 'Bellybutton', 'elf', 'Lair', 'Lummux', 'commentary', 'makers', 'said', 'originally', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'farting', 'contest', 'episode', 'curiousity', 'even', 'more', 'how', 'far', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'certain', 'episodes', 'were', ""n't"", 'commentaried', 'actually', 'very', 'interesting', 'hearing', 'where', 'ideas', 'came', 'noticed', 'something', 'strange', '3rd', 'disc', 'exception', 'Farm', 'Hands', 'other', 'ones', 'episodes', 'became', 'kind', 'dull', 'forgettable', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'due', 'original', 'workers', 'show', 'being', 'fired', 'replaced', 'peaple', 'chosen', 'Nick', 'make', 'part', '4th', 'season', 'box', 'set', 'sense', 'mean', 'felt', 'compared', 'episodes', '1st', 'box', 'set', 'first', 'two', 'disc', 'were', 'holding', 'back', 'less', 'bold', 'was', 'kind', 'disappointing', 'aspect', 'Other', ""'re"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Ren', 'Stimpy', 'worth', 'having', 'least', 'more', 'ballsy', 'extreme', 'episodes', 'early', 'worth', 'buy']",The Ren and Stimpy Show - Seasons Three and a Half-ish

The prices it was at seemed worth it, but I have to admit there were things I guess i just didnt pay attention to back then.I cant for the life of me remember the animation being so stock. colours quite blotched and dull, but I guess that adds to the charm of it.All these classic episodes still get the laughs out of me. I guess its one of those collectables which I will hold onto for a while, but I dont really see myself watching it all that much more then once.Passed it onto friends, they had the same feeling about it. Awesome yet they also forgot about how stock it was, I blame new CG in movies, new gen animation (ala pixar) and the death of 2D cartoons (mind you, the simpsons still rule that domain).Good to remind you of lesser stressful times and being care free.

903824,A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I,B0009CTV4U,"GameraRocks ""captpicardfan""","[1, 4]","I'm a big fan of Ren and Stimpy, always have been since they debuted way back in the early 90's on Nick. ""Season Three and a Halfish"" is an okay collection, but does have some of my favorite episodes. Why I say that this season and a half collection is okay is because it just doesn't seem to make me laugh as hard as I did with the first two seasons. But episodes like ""Hermit Ren"" keep this very much worth getting, ""Hermit Ren"" possibly being my all time favorite Ren and Stimpy episode.What's worst about this is the lack of extras. Ren and Stimpy Uncut, the first two season that were released on DVD, had a crap load of extras even including a ""banned"" episode that later appeared on Spike TV. But this has nothing but commentary during the episodes? Lame. I'm not a fan of commentary; I never listen to it on any of my DVDs. I prefer sit down in front of the camera interviews like what was given on the first DVD.Overall, you're only getting your moneys worth for the episodes, because if you are buying this for the extras, you are getting ripped off big time. As if commentary by Ren and Stimpy themselves, which is on here, would make the commentary more interesting, it doesn't. The episodes are pretty much the way I remember them, sometimes I'm laughing hard, sometimes giggling and at other times no emotion. The ""Hard Times for Haggis"" episode didn't make me laugh at all, it actually made me feel sorry for McHaggis and I know that that wasn't the episodes intention. This was after John K. left Ren and Stimpy and his absence can be seen on this collection. Not to say that this collection is entirely bad, it has some really great stuff, but the lack of extras and some mediocre episodes weigh this collection down. A big departure from the last DVD, NEED MORE EXTRAS. So if you're a R&S; fan, get it, I did but don't expect anything big. Being a hardcore Ren and Stimpy fan,  I never thought I'd be saying this but let's just hope the next DVD is better.",3,"Okay Episodes, Bad Extras.

This way, Paramount can release three mediocore seasons in only two sets, as their next set will contain the rest of season four and season five.At ths point in the series' roller coaster ride, the show was just taken from John K and Spumco, and was now being made by Nickelodeon and their company Games Animaton. I'll get right to the point: if you love the first and second season episodes of the show like I do, you most likely will be very disappointed by these. The show is a mere shell of what it was. Visually, it looks alright, with nice background painting and some good posing work (not exactly Spumco-quality though), but the writing and stories are completely abysmal. There's none of the wacky humor of the original shows, and they're about stories that I don't care about. And the show's keep going and going, and then they just end. Pretty much all of these shows have inconclusive endings; they just stop. Billy West is doing Stimpy, and now Ren here, as well as essentially every other voice. It could practically be called the Billy West show. As brilliant a voice actor he is, it's really just too much. Between this and the misplacement of celebrity voices, who have absolutely no place in the world of Ren & Stimpy (like Rosie O'Donnell), the show doesn't sound good either. The shame is that some episodes have a good premise (""Hard Times for Haggis"") or start out well (""Hermit Ren"") and they turn completely awful. It's a stone cold shame.So if I hate these shows so much, then why am I giving it two stars? Well, it's got some things going for it. On the first disc, some of the episodes there were originally started at Spumco and finished by Games. But, they still retain some good moments. Shows like ""To Salve or Salve Not!"", ""Stimpy's Cartoon Show"", and ""Jimminy Lummox"" have some moments I like. John K and the original Spumco team are bcak for more commentary on a lot of shows, and I'd say they're worth listening too, but I really enjoy listening to commentairies. And, the box and disc art, and the actual DVD is very well done.Is this set worth getting? I'd say no, but some extreme Ren and Stimpy fans might be interested in getting it.

903835,A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B0009CTV4U,"Michael Kerner ""Michael Kerner""","[9, 14]","Arguably, when it came to the last DVD package with Ren & Stimpy, most of the beloved cartoons were edited down, and not resolved into a must-have for die hard fans of the Nickelodeon classic cat & dog duo. The move was a unfortunate and crucial dissapointement on so many of the delightful cartoons that made them legends. While that did cave in a bit, the next version is arguably under the exact same spell with showing the beginning of the demise of the two. With John K., the creator of Ren & Stimpy leaving the voice of Ren behind and giving it to Billy West, Stimpy's voice, the show had to go on a new path.The Ren & Stimpy Show: Seasons Three & A Halfish, sneaks within the third and part of the fourth years for the Cat & Dog duo. At the time when Nicktoon cartoons like Rocko's Modern Life, AHHHHHH!! Real Monsters, and Doug were really great connectors to the younger crowds, Ren & Stimpy still showed potential with great cartoons like Ren's Pecs, were plastic surgery from Stimpy's heiny is now Ren's chest, Eat My Cookies: with the focus of Ren & Stimpy score several badges in a scouting troup, with guest voice Rosie O'Donnell as the scoutmaster, Road Apples: with the duo trying to live their lives in a modest but weird motorhome, and Hard Time For Haggis, with the duo in cameos, and take over the spotlight from a old time Scottish star Haggis McHaggis, and others to name a few. Like the first DVD collection where so many great shorts were edited down for space, this collection also hits that same roadblock for die hard fans of Ren & Stimpy, which continues to remain very unfortunate.All in all, Paramount should've really learned from the previous collection but they haven't took the motions scorned. Still, for anybody who hasn't seen Ren & Stimpy from the Nickelodeon days, or the recent revivals from Spike!, this is still worth a passing glance.

But for a classic cartoon missing its creator, its still very enjoyable.Now all of these episodes would've been better if Spumco had finished them. But with these seasons, you got more original and strange plot ideas and even stranger jokes. Its been said in other reviews that the episodes get monotonous. But its a good formula. Games even developed their own weird, arguably equal style of stupid cartoon-making. More chaotic, freeform, plotless and fun. But not as smart, artistic or funny. What's really amazing in these episodes is the BEAUTIFUL color and background work in this season. The addition of Wilbur Cobb is great for those of us with a macarbe sense of humor.Now for the negatives: It is missing the great storytelling and expert comic direction of the early episodes. There was alot of heart under all of the original crass fart and nipple jokes. Billy West taking over most of the voices is admirable, but his Ren is the worst. You just feel so much intesity is lost in the title characters. Also, John K berating the efforts of the Games studio during commentaries gets really old. He goes on and on with his bitterness while the other artists try to see the positives. Its understandable bitterness, but its still just sad.What's ironic is when John K produced new Ren and Stimpy cartoons with APC, he fell into all of the criticisms he made against Games!

Whether Powdered Toast Man is trying to save Little Johnny, or Ren's nature show is examining Lummoxes, there's so much great stuff in here I can't name it all.  Sure, ""Circus Midgets"" was a disappointing episode, and ""It's a Dog's Life"" and ""Bass Masters"" aren't much beyond a rehashing of old episode ideas, but really, they don't even make a dent in the wonderful quality of Season Three and a Half-ish.The only thing I didn't like about this set was its adult rating.  The verbal content of the DVD previews and commentaries taints a show that could be easily enjoyed by kids as well as adults.  But then again, the commentaries are insightful at times, especially for episodes like, ""Eat My Cookies"" (which had a special guest star) and ""Stimpy's Cartoon Show"" which showed a parody of the animation industry.  Even so, I was let down a few times when the commentators laughed at what they were saying more than what was being shown on the screen.The commentaries are filled with criticism against the later drawings of Ren and Stimpy, where the duo looks too much like a cookie-cutter presentation.  A lot of what is said by the commentators (who produced the original show) is quite valid, but I'm glad they were limited by Nickelodeon in a way, since it forced them to be a little more creative with their content in order to avoid putting too much obscene stuff up on the screen.  That might explain why the Spike TV Ren and Stimpy didn't do too well.""An Abe Divided"" is easily the best cartoon in this set, even though ""Hermit Ren"" is my personal favorite.
