In four movies loosely based on the Douglas Adams books, Dirk spins his bizarre and implausible cases to their twisted inevitable conclusions. Readers of the Adams books will recognize the tongue-in-cheek inclusions of the refrigerator from hell, unpaid receptionist, mysterious homicidal cleaning lady and Gilks, the enraged police detective.Dripping snark and pizza remnants, Dirk runs up unlikely expenses while stealing food and linking random coincidences with his quantum-level theory of the interconnectedness of all things. He dupes Richard MacDuff (Darren Boyd) into financing and joining Dirk as his partner? assistant? patsy? much to the dismay of MacDuff's girlfriend, Susan Harmison (Helen Baxendale). They shamble though each case, often to MacDuff's horror, yet somehow survive and sorta triumph in the end.",5,The interconnectedness of all things.,1384128000,"11 11, 2013",2013,924,"['Meet', 'Dirk', 'Gently', 'Stephen', 'Mangan', 'half', 'conman', 'half', 'detective', 'half', 'mad', 'insolent', 'cheapskate', 'four', 'movies', 'loosely', 'based', 'Douglas', 'Adams', 'books', 'Dirk', 'bizarre', 'implausible', 'cases', 'twisted', 'inevitable', 'conclusions', 'Readers', 'Adams', 'books', 'will', 'recognize', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'inclusions', 'refrigerator', 'hell', 'unpaid', 'receptionist', 'mysterious', 'homicidal', 'cleaning', 'lady', 'Gilks', 'enraged', 'police', 'detective.Dripping', 'snark', 'pizza', 'remnants', 'Dirk', 'up', 'unlikely', 'expenses', 'stealing', 'food', 'linking', 'random', 'coincidences', 'quantum-level', 'theory', 'interconnectedness', 'things', 'Richard', 'MacDuff', 'Darren', 'Boyd', 'financing', 'joining', 'Dirk', 'partner', 'assistant', 'patsy', 'much', 'dismay', 'MacDuff', 'girlfriend', 'Susan', 'Harmison', 'Helen', 'Baxendale', 'shamble', 'case', 'often', 'MacDuff', 'horror', 'somehow', 'survive', 'sorta', 'triumph', 'end']",Dirk Gently: Series 1 [Region 2]
