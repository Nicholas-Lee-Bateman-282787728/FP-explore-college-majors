618900,A3TUE4JZMN4HYO,B00005JMHB,"Brian Martin ""foliowyrm""","[3, 3]","On a whim I decided to watch ""The Real Cancun"" having missed its all to short theatrical release.  I am positive I am older than the target audience but ""The Real World"" and ""Road Rules"" were brand new when I was in college in the early 1990's and I was a fan of both those series.This movie was edited very poorly.  There are way too many characters to keep track of, and the audience cannot possibly know or care about any of them. The movie follows a simple pattern. We'll start to get a glimpses into some of the characters but then it reverts to a collage of party and beach scenes, followed by a insight from another character then more partying.  The movie can't even decide if it cares about any of these kids or if it just wants to be some sort of skin flick, although it doesn't succeed there either because not much skin is shown.The movie does depict more than a few of the kids in situations they are sure to regret when they are older, especially since the behavior is chronicled and will be available in bargain dvd bins for years to come.  The twin girls (I forget there names) come off especially bad.The extras include interviews with some of the cast members at a premier party.  This is especially interesting because they all look mortified.  There are several deleted scenes, most of which are boring.  There is one scene that I am curious as to why it was excised from the movie and that is the women's wet t-shirt contest.  It is a little more raunchy than anything else in the movie (thanks again to the twins), but a little raunch didn't faze the other hour or so of the movie so I continue to be curious as to why it was left out.In the end this movie has little to recommend it and if you never see it you will not have missed anything important.",2,It's boring and not sure what it wants to be.,1155600000,"08 15, 2006",2006,1774,"['whim', 'decided', 'watch', 'Real', 'Cancun', 'having', 'missed', 'short', 'theatrical', 'release', 'am', 'positive', 'am', 'older', 'target', 'audience', 'Real', 'World', 'Road', 'Rules', 'were', 'brand', 'new', 'when', 'was', 'college', 'early', '1990', 'was', 'fan', 'series.This', 'movie', 'was', 'edited', 'very', 'poorly', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'keep', 'track', 'audience', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'know', 'care', 'movie', 'simple', 'pattern', ""'ll"", 'start', 'get', 'glimpses', 'characters', 'then', 'collage', 'party', 'beach', 'scenes', 'followed', 'insight', 'character', 'then', 'more', 'partying', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'decide', 'kids', 'just', 'be', 'sort', 'skin', 'flick', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'there', 'either', 'not', 'much', 'skin', 'shown.The', 'movie', 'depict', 'more', 'few', 'kids', 'situations', 'are', 'sure', 'regret', 'when', 'are', 'older', 'especially', 'behavior', 'chronicled', 'will', 'be', 'available', 'bargain', 'dvd', 'years', 'come', 'twin', 'girls', 'forget', 'there', 'names', 'come', 'off', 'especially', 'bad.The', 'extras', 'include', 'interviews', 'cast', 'members', 'premier', 'party', 'especially', 'interesting', 'look', 'mortified', 'are', 'several', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'most', 'are', 'boring', 'one', 'scene', 'am', 'curious', 'why', 'was', 'excised', 'movie', 'women', 'wet', 't-shirt', 'contest', 'little', 'more', 'raunchy', 'anything', 'else', 'movie', 'thanks', 'again', 'twins', 'little', 'raunch', 'did', ""n't"", 'faze', 'other', 'hour', 'so', 'movie', 'so', 'continue', 'be', 'curious', 'why', 'was', 'left', 'out.In', 'end', 'movie', 'little', 'recommend', 'never', 'see', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'missed', 'anything', 'important']",The Real Cancun
618901,AB9WCN34TY8CV,B00005JMHB,Charles Sutherland,"[5, 7]","Okay, the Real World and Road Rules from MTV started back when I was in my 20s, and I could relate to some of the people, although I realized right away that these people were not living in the Real World at all.  I thought it might be nice to be part of the Real World, but I was already over 25, and as we all know, no one in the real world is over 25.I guess the problem for me is that I kept getting older while the people on the new shows each season just stay in their early 20s.  How real is that?  As time went on I watched less and less, and now I haven't seen a Real World or Road Rules episode for ages.One of the things I always felt watching the shows though was that it was too bad there was censorship on television.  I always got the feeling there was something just happening off camera, behind the doors, or on the cutting room floor.  And I don't just mean bedroom stuff, either.Well, in making a movie, MTV wanted to get away from that limitation, but it didn't really work.  There's not enough time to know the characters, and the wilder side just seems to be nudity for the sake of pleasing a camera, not involvement with each other.  Again, how real is that?  They start with 16, but end up following only about half a dozen in any depth, and of course in 90 minutes you can't really even do that many people much justice for finding out who they are.One thing that I am reminded of is that the Gulf War started while this film was being shot and all these kids were partying in Cancun and not a word was spoken or mentioned by anyone about that.  Again, how real is that?Not very real, and I guess it just shows that I am really getting old.

618905,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B00005JMHB,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[0, 0]","""The Real Cancun"" could be easily summarized as just a dozen campus frat-jacks going nuts on spring break vacay, but that would suggest there is absolutely nothing substantial to discuss about the film and its subjects.  But oh, there is; let's get pretentious.  It's a 'compelling' ensemble piece within the cornucopia of cleavage and cognac, establishing the leads with their own tales.  It's about a nerd who partook in this Cancun trip for the purpose of seeing bosoms while avoiding the pressures of heavy drinking.  It's about female twins who were about to face a challenging to find their inner courage, to enter a hot t-shirt contest.  It's about a sporty girl who found love after a fellow urinated her wound from a Jellyfish sting, even though she had a boyfriend back home.  Throughout the week, questions will be asked.  Will the nerd give in to the temptation from drinking vodka from a woman's navel?  Will that black fellow succeed in hitting on a hard-to-get ebony lady? Will a country girl be able to keep her virginity? And finally, will there be a conflict to break the romance between the sporty girl and her peeing opposite?I think the real question is, who thought it's a good idea to make a feature-length film loosely based on a reality show?  I guess the people who liked ""Ringmaster"", but in any case, reality shows don't have any merits to transition into the big screen, not for narrative or structure.  And thus, ""The Real Cancun"" is not a movie, even by documentary standards.  It's really just a lengthy special of ""The Real World"", and much like ""The Real World"" (or what little I've seen from it), it has the usual character archetypes, the usual tomfoolery, and the usual 'real' drama that characters encounter and vindicate.  In fact, all their sexist, neanderthal actions don't really surprise me.One would suggest the reason for this to be theatrical is that it can get away with showing nudity and language unblurred(except, amusingly, men's crotches), which might help its favor during release, but nowadays, the content itself didn't push any more boundaries that what one could see from any reality show on uncensored DVD.  And that's the REAL problem with this movie: compared to VERY raunchy reality programmings like ""Flavor of Love"", ""The Surreal Life"", and ""Shot at Love with Tila Tequila"", this is very tamed.  Nobody fought, nothing grotesque actually happened (besides the urine scene), there were a few arguments but nothing followed those, and there wasn't even a crying scene.  All it had was its sensuality, and that's nothing compared to ""Girls Gone Wild"".  I was begging for this movie to let loose on high-grade trashiness, but it was holding back; that's something not even Johnny Knoxville would allow.In the end, ""The Real Cancun"" isn't a week worth remembering.  It's a huge waste of time for those who don't like reality shows, and it's a disappointment for those who do.  Spring Break never feel this dull, but this movie manage to be a killjoy.",1,"""Pee on it!""",1280880000,"08 4, 2010",2010,3008,"['Real', 'Cancun', 'could', 'be', 'easily', 'summarized', 'just', 'dozen', 'campus', 'frat-jacks', 'going', 'nuts', 'spring', 'break', 'vacay', 'would', 'suggest', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'substantial', 'discuss', 'film', 'subjects', 'oh', 'let', 'get', 'pretentious', ""'compelling"", 'ensemble', 'piece', 'cornucopia', 'cleavage', 'cognac', 'establishing', 'leads', 'own', 'tales', 'nerd', 'who', 'partook', 'Cancun', 'trip', 'purpose', 'seeing', 'bosoms', 'avoiding', 'pressures', 'heavy', 'drinking', 'female', 'twins', 'who', 'were', 'about', 'face', 'challenging', 'find', 'inner', 'courage', 'enter', 'hot', 't-shirt', 'contest', 'sporty', 'girl', 'who', 'found', 'love', 'fellow', 'urinated', 'wound', 'Jellyfish', 'sting', 'even', 'had', 'boyfriend', 'back', 'home', 'week', 'questions', 'will', 'be', 'asked', 'Will', 'nerd', 'give', 'temptation', 'drinking', 'vodka', 'woman', 'navel', 'Will', 'black', 'fellow', 'succeed', 'hitting', 'hard-to-get', 'ebony', 'lady', 'Will', 'country', 'girl', 'be', 'able', 'keep', 'virginity', 'finally', 'will', 'there', 'be', 'conflict', 'break', 'romance', 'sporty', 'girl', 'peeing', 'opposite', 'think', 'real', 'question', 'who', 'thought', 'good', 'idea', 'make', 'feature-length', 'film', 'loosely', 'based', 'reality', 'show', 'guess', 'people', 'who', 'liked', 'Ringmaster', 'case', 'reality', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'merits', 'transition', 'big', 'screen', 'not', 'narrative', 'structure', 'thus', 'Real', 'Cancun', 'not', 'movie', 'even', 'documentary', 'standards', 'really', 'just', 'lengthy', 'special', 'Real', 'World', 'much', 'Real', 'World', 'what', 'little', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'usual', 'character', 'archetypes', 'usual', 'tomfoolery', 'usual', ""'real"", 'drama', 'characters', 'encounter', 'vindicate', 'fact', 'sexist', 'neanderthal', 'actions', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'surprise', 'me.One', 'would', 'suggest', 'reason', 'be', 'theatrical', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'showing', 'nudity', 'language', 'unblurred', 'amusingly', 'men', 'crotches', 'might', 'help', 'favor', 'release', 'nowadays', 'content', 'did', ""n't"", 'push', 'more', 'boundaries', 'what', 'one', 'could', 'see', 'reality', 'show', 'uncensored', 'DVD', 'REAL', 'problem', 'movie', 'compared', 'VERY', 'raunchy', 'reality', 'programmings', 'Flavor', 'Love', 'Surreal', 'Life', 'Shot', 'Love', 'Tila', 'Tequila', 'very', 'tamed', 'Nobody', 'fought', 'nothing', 'grotesque', 'actually', 'happened', 'urine', 'scene', 'were', 'few', 'arguments', 'nothing', 'followed', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'crying', 'scene', 'had', 'was', 'sensuality', 'nothing', 'compared', 'Girls', 'Gone', 'Wild', 'was', 'begging', 'movie', 'let', 'loose', 'high-grade', 'trashiness', 'was', 'holding', 'back', 'something', 'not', 'even', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'would', 'allow.In', 'end', 'Real', 'Cancun', ""n't"", 'week', 'worth', 'remembering', 'huge', 'waste', 'time', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'reality', 'shows', 'disappointment', 'who', 'do', 'Spring', 'Break', 'never', 'feel', 'dull', 'movie', 'manage', 'be', 'killjoy']",The Real Cancun

What makes it so cool to get drunk? Maybe I sound a little too overreactive to this crap but I lost a friend in an alcohol-related accident years back so I have grief at the sad state of the entertainment industry, promoting this awful behavior in these movies.I can enjoy a great vacation to Cancun.......without resorting to any alcoholic drinking sprees.The so-called 'hot chicks' as many proclaim, are not attractive at all. In fact, they are repulsive. Even the guys are absolutely repulsive to look at.Drinking, and sex make a terrible and even fatal combination. Alcohol does not increase your sexual desire, nor improve your sex lives. It instead will suppress your sexual desires and ultimately ruin a lot more than just a good and healthy sex life.I'm a college student, in the same age area as the cast of ""The Real Cancun"" but I am absolutely offended and saddened at the pathetic state that the entertainment industry has sunk to.Then again, I shouldn't be so upset as they got what they deserved with this movie failing miserably at the box office. Perhaps it's a sign that our society, while still seamingly a mudhole of idiocity in many places, is beginning to wake up and realize that such immature, disgusting, vile, and absolutely insulting reality show garbage like this is destined to be tossed into the caverns of shame.If this is what Cancun is really like, which I highly doubt, then I'm so glad to live in a region of the country where winters are long and severe.

In this movie, MTV takes 16 college aged students on a spring break to Cancun.  They are put up in a house and they are filmed for the length of their stay.  This film has been rated R for ""strong sexuality/nudity, language and partying.""  This is a reality film in the vein of The Real World.  We get to see 16 real college students partying on spring break.  We expect that we'll see more sex, nudity, and cursing than we get on The Real World.  There is more of each, but the movie (such as it is) fails where The Real World succeeds.Part of the tagline for this movie reads ""Anything can happen on Spring Break-and it did!""  Perhaps anything did happen, but the problem is that this ""anything"" was boring.  Watching The Real World, we get to find out who these people are and we can begin to be interested in what happens to the kids on The Real World.  I understand that The Real Cancun is only an hour and a half for the entire film (rather than multiple hour long episodes), but it suffers from not allowing the viewer to identify with any of the kids on Spring Break.  Actually, the movie suffers from a lot more than just that, but the lack of identification was a biggie.  Since I had no idea who more than half of the kids were, I didn't care what happened to them.  By the end, I was able to recognize a small handful of them, but I just didn't care.Something else that was done well on the Real World was that every episode had a storyline running through it, and with editing, we were brought along that storyline.  There was nothing in The Real Cancun.  It was a collection of scenes featuring the same people, but nothing more than that.The bottom line is simply that this is a bad movie.  It wasn't funny when it was intending to be funny, and it didn't have the interest level required of a ""reality"" show.  Even if you take this as a T&A; movie, it fails on that point, too.  I'd really like to find something positive to say about The Real Cancun, but I just can't think of anything.",1,just bad....,1070928000,"12 9, 2003",2003,2115,"['film', 'Rick', 'de', 'OliveiraThe', 'Real', 'Cancun', 'brought', 'good', 'folks', 'who', 'gave', 'MTV', 'Real', 'World', 'movie', 'MTV', '16', 'college', 'aged', 'students', 'spring', 'break', 'Cancun', 'are', 'put', 'up', 'house', 'are', 'filmed', 'length', 'stay', 'film', 'been', 'rated', 'R', 'strong', 'sexuality/nudity', 'language', 'partying', 'reality', 'film', 'vein', 'Real', 'World', 'get', 'see', '16', 'real', 'college', 'students', 'partying', 'spring', 'break', 'expect', ""'ll"", 'see', 'more', 'sex', 'nudity', 'cursing', 'get', 'Real', 'World', 'more', 'movie', 'such', 'where', 'Real', 'World', 'succeeds.Part', 'tagline', 'movie', 'Anything', 'can', 'happen', 'Spring', 'Break-and', 'did', 'Perhaps', 'anything', 'did', 'happen', 'problem', 'anything', 'was', 'boring', 'Watching', 'Real', 'World', 'get', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'people', 'are', 'can', 'begin', 'be', 'interested', 'what', 'kids', 'Real', 'World', 'understand', 'Real', 'Cancun', 'only', 'hour', 'half', 'entire', 'film', 'rather', 'multiple', 'hour', 'long', 'episodes', 'not', 'allowing', 'viewer', 'identify', 'kids', 'Spring', 'Break', 'Actually', 'movie', 'suffers', 'lot', 'more', 'just', 'lack', 'identification', 'was', 'biggie', 'had', 'idea', 'who', 'more', 'half', 'kids', 'were', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'happened', 'end', 'was', 'able', 'recognize', 'small', 'handful', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care.Something', 'else', 'was', 'done', 'well', 'Real', 'World', 'was', 'episode', 'had', 'storyline', 'running', 'editing', 'were', 'brought', 'storyline', 'was', 'nothing', 'Real', 'Cancun', 'was', 'collection', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'same', 'people', 'nothing', 'more', 'that.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'simply', 'bad', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'when', 'was', 'intending', 'be', 'funny', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'interest', 'level', 'required', 'reality', 'show', 'Even', 'take', 'T', 'A', 'movie', 'point', 'too', ""'d"", 'really', 'like', 'find', 'something', 'positive', 'say', 'Real', 'Cancun', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything']",The Real Cancun

618911,A16X7GKCK83WUE,B00005JMHB,"Matthew Bratkowski ""mattster""","[4, 6]","The Real Cancun follows the same basic format as the MTV show ""The Real World.""  Basically, a bunch of strangest are thrown together for spring break.  If you are not a fan of ""The Real World,"" you probably won't like this movie.  If you do enjoy ""The Real World,"" you still might not like ""The Real Cancun.""  The main problem is that there are too many characters (16 totatl) and not enough time to develop many of the (only about an hour and a half).  Also, the personal interviews of the characters from ""The Real World"" are absent in this movie.  Since this is the case, few characters are interesting and most of them are just there doing nothing.  The one character that basically carries the movie is Alan, the conservative, non-drinker who learns how to have fun while in Cancun.  Other characters are basically wasted.  While watching the previews for this movie, I thought that the twins (Roxanne and Nicole) would be interesting to watch in the movie.  Although they do compete in a wet T-shirt contest in one scene, afterwards they are basically forgotton.There are a few special features on the DVD that I wouldn't suggest watching even if you watch the movie.  One feature has commentary by each member of the cast.  Most of the characters ramble on about half developed incidents, or even incidents that were not covered at all in the movie.  Don't watch it.  It just draws on and on and is boring.Basically, the Real Cancun is just a waste of time.  Although one of the movie's pitches was that it would feature lots of girls ""going wild,"" this is really a deception.  Don't let the cover of the DVD fool you; other than a few wet T-shirt contests, there is not much nuditity in the film.  Don't watch it expecting to see lots of naked girls.The Real Cancun isn't worth watching.

618912,A2GZTI0EIOCQNZ,B00005JMHB,"M. Hind ""daria_m""","[2, 2]","I went into watching ""The Real Cancun"" with very low expectations.  Much to my chagrin, many of these expectations were met.  Let's face it: it's very hard to produce a film that has no plot, no climax moment (no pun intended), and no resolution.  There are occasional conflicts amidst the partygoers, but these arguments seem very immature.One must also argue just how ""real"" this film is.  These sixteen kids were chosen by MTV (their trips were probably paid for) to mix and mingle in a deluxe resort house, with a multitude of tequila shots and hot bodies at their disposal.  Now, if this were a REAL Cancun spring break, several key moments would have been featured in the film:#1 - They all would have been puking in the street by the end of the night thanks to all of that tequila.#2 - They would have had to work terribly hard for the money or borrow it (sometimes from their own financial aid) to purchase the trip package.#3 - They would have missed the first two days of classes afterwards because they were still hungover.#4 - Snoop Dogg might not have performed, nor would he have invited most of the ""cast"" onstage to dance with him.Since the focus of the movie is on T & A, it seems a bit gratuitous and artificial.  Basically, this is a glorified ""Real World"" with the nudity and sex left in.  The only thing missing was a confessional booth.I agree with many of the reviewers who have said that the audience didn't really get to know any of the kids.  Instead of giving them depth and humanity, essential for any movie with ""real"" in the title, the movie makes them appear silly and/or stereotypical.  One could argue that many of the Real World seasons of the last few years seem a bit contrived compared to the raw very first season.  This film only accentuates that idea that reality television/film is no longer centered on reality.  It's centered on exposure and fame.What does save this movie from absolute pointlessness are the few moments of laughter.  Examples: Alan finally letting loose, the antics of Paul and his speedo-wearing buddy, the jellyfish sting, and the mariachi band providing a live alarm clock to the sleeping party animals.If you like the ""Girls Gone Wild"" videos, you'll love this movie.

Do you carry that stereotype of the French being rude to tourists around with you? Well forget it, buddy. After this movie you'll wonder why the French don't kill American tourists and why everyone else is so polite.A bunch of generic Frat types go to Cancun for drinking and wet t-shirt contests. Many of them ""hook up"" as the kids call it these days. One gets the ""shy kid gets booze and becomes wild man"" storyline (and in the extras you discover that the reason why he wasn't getting naked on the beach with the blond has more to do with his girlfriend back home than repression) and the rest get lamer stories. There's one poor guy that spends most of his time playing guitar and must content himself to be solo dude - like Jeff Goldblum in The Big Chill when everyone else is taking full advantage of the college reunion.
