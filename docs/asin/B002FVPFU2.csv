She is like Molla in my opinion, just human. The ending was brilliant, but sad. Will not tell why. Watch it. I don't want to spoil anything. Some people in reviews claim that this film is boring. It wasn't for me. Not at all. I was fascinated by it. And even had some tears at the end. I hate the destructive nature of humans. But this is so true about us.

1267143,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B002FVPFU2,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[0, 0]","I had heard some things about Battle For Terra, but I wasn't too sure of what I was getting into. I got a lot more than what I expected, and experienced one of the ten best animated films I've ever seen. This film was absolutely incredible in every way imaginable. It was thrilling, emotionally-driven, and it has something meaningful and insightful to say. This film is simply superb and breath-taking, and almost perfect.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Terra is a peaceful planet that the humans are looking to colonize after they destroyed their previous home planets Earth, Mars, and Venus through war. At first the Terrians think the humans and their spacecrafts are gods, and many allow themselves to be taken. The main character Mala is trying to find her father who was taken by the humans, and when she tries to get taken herself, she ends up causing one of the spacecrafts to crash. She ends up rescuing the pilot named Jim and taking him back to her home along with his robot Giddy. She ends up having to construct a special tent for oxygen so he can breathe, and after she rescues him again when he tries to escape, she makes a deal with him to help him fix his ship and he'll take her to her father. From then on, things go awry and then it becomes all out war between the humans and Terrians, and it is up to Jim to fix all of this and save both the Terrians and the humans from extinction.MUSIC: The musical score is fantastic and fits everything to a tee. It could be both calming and then erupt with a fantastic orchestral score whenever the occasion called for it.ACTING: Though there were some moments of corny dialogue, the voice-acting is terrific. I was surprised by some of the names they managed to get for this film (Danny Glover, Dennis Quaid, etc.) despite its small budget. Thankfully there were no annoying characters and every actor seemed to know what they were doing.ACTION: Before George Lucas made the crappy Star Wars: The Clone Wars animated film he should have taken notes from Battle For Terra (It originally debuted at a film festival in 2007, a year before Clone Wars). This film has enough action scenes to satisfy any fan of sci-fi action flicks. They were thrilling, explosive, and really cool. However, it's not the action that makes all of this film, it's the story and the amazingly intense moral situations (Who will you choose to save?) and I'd have to say this is one of those films that really pushes its rating. This is probably one of the hardest PG-rated films I've ever seen and pushes dangerously close to PG-13 at times because of its violence. This film was a very intense and thought-provoking experience that really gets you to think about many things. Overall, it was never boring.OVERALL: This film is a must-have if you love animated films. This film is insightful and smart about its messages and questions how far you can push your morals. A film that slipped under the radar and was lambasted by moronic critics who don't seem to understand complexity when its sitting right in front of them. This film is simply amazing and a masterpiece of animated cinema that is not to be missed.THE GOOD: Great story, good acting, superb action scenes, thoughtful messages, great looking animation, and it does a good job about making you think.THE BAD: Some corny dialogue.",5,ONE OF THE BEST ANIMATED FILMS EVER MADE  9.5 OUT OF 10,1268524800,"03 14, 2010",2010,3312,"['had', 'heard', 'things', 'Battle', 'Terra', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'getting', 'got', 'lot', 'more', 'what', 'expected', 'experienced', 'one', 'ten', 'best', 'animated', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'was', 'absolutely', 'incredible', 'way', 'imaginable', 'was', 'thrilling', 'emotionally-driven', 'something', 'meaningful', 'insightful', 'say', 'film', 'simply', 'superb', 'breath-taking', 'almost', 'perfect.WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'Terra', 'peaceful', 'planet', 'humans', 'are', 'looking', 'colonize', 'destroyed', 'previous', 'home', 'planets', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Venus', 'war', 'first', 'Terrians', 'think', 'humans', 'spacecrafts', 'are', 'gods', 'many', 'allow', 'be', 'taken', 'main', 'character', 'Mala', 'trying', 'find', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'taken', 'humans', 'when', 'get', 'taken', 'up', 'causing', 'one', 'spacecrafts', 'crash', 'up', 'rescuing', 'pilot', 'named', 'Jim', 'taking', 'back', 'home', 'robot', 'Giddy', 'up', 'having', 'construct', 'special', 'tent', 'oxygen', 'can', 'breathe', 'again', 'when', 'escape', 'deal', 'help', 'fix', 'ship', ""'ll"", 'take', 'father', 'then', 'things', 'go', 'awry', 'then', 'out', 'war', 'humans', 'Terrians', 'Jim', 'fix', 'save', 'Terrians', 'humans', 'extinction.MUSIC', 'musical', 'score', 'fantastic', 'everything', 'tee', 'could', 'be', 'calming', 'then', 'erupt', 'fantastic', 'orchestral', 'score', 'whenever', 'occasion', 'called', 'it.ACTING', 'were', 'moments', 'corny', 'dialogue', 'voice-acting', 'terrific', 'was', 'surprised', 'names', 'managed', 'get', 'film', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'etc', 'small', 'budget', 'Thankfully', 'were', 'annoying', 'characters', 'actor', 'seemed', 'know', 'what', 'were', 'doing.ACTION', 'George', 'Lucas', 'made', 'crappy', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'animated', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'notes', 'Battle', 'Terra', 'originally', 'debuted', 'film', 'festival', '2007', 'year', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'film', 'enough', 'action', 'scenes', 'satisfy', 'fan', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'flicks', 'were', 'thrilling', 'explosive', 'really', 'cool', 'However', 'not', 'action', 'film', 'story', 'amazingly', 'intense', 'moral', 'situations', 'Who', 'will', 'choose', 'save', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'one', 'films', 'really', 'rating', 'probably', 'one', 'hardest', 'PG-rated', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'pushes', 'dangerously', 'close', 'PG-13', 'times', 'violence', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'intense', 'thought-provoking', 'experience', 'really', 'think', 'many', 'things', 'Overall', 'was', 'never', 'boring.OVERALL', 'film', 'must-have', 'love', 'animated', 'films', 'film', 'insightful', 'smart', 'messages', 'questions', 'how', 'far', 'can', 'push', 'morals', 'film', 'slipped', 'radar', 'was', 'lambasted', 'moronic', 'critics', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'understand', 'complexity', 'when', 'sitting', 'right', 'front', 'film', 'simply', 'amazing', 'masterpiece', 'animated', 'cinema', 'not', 'be', 'missed.THE', 'GOOD', 'Great', 'story', 'good', 'acting', 'superb', 'action', 'scenes', 'thoughtful', 'messages', 'great', 'looking', 'animation', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'think.THE', 'BAD', 'corny', 'dialogue']",Battle for Terra

The animation does not try to be anymore than animation. However I only saw the Blu-ray version and not the 3D version.One of the fun things is to try to figure out some of the more popular voices as the different characters appear.Watching the extras on the DVD makes me thing that someday there will be a 3 hour version. The voice over reminds us that this fill was made years before there was a Bush vs. Obama; so do not read too much into the characters. Several other places in the story they try to not be too sensitive to the movie audience.

1267151,A3KA6CG7VG4JAK,B002FVPFU2,Buzz1954,"[0, 0]","Battle for Terra is a dynamic tale of desperation & misunderstanding. It is hard to believe that earthlings could be this irresponsible, & could be so ruthless, that they would be wiling to commit genocide, just to have a new home.Yet, even after all these centuries, humanity has failed to learn from their mistakes.The major characters in this movie, are the Terrian Mala, & the human pilot, Lt. James Stanton.The Terrians are a superstitious people who initially think that when the ARK, (the humans spaceship), first arrives above their planet-they believe it to be gods. But the leaders of the Terrians know better, because unknown to many of their people, they have been secretly preparing for the possible invasion of their planet, although being a peaceful people-knew that possibility might happen at some time.Their unwillingness to trust any human, is echoed in the fact that the same thing could be said about humans attitudes to trust an alien species-a viewpoint that leads to a full-scale invasion of Terra, something the Terrians have been preparing for, for years.Yet, there is a great sadness in this movie, in the fact that the humans are desperate, because the ARK is literally disintegrating around them, & there is almost no time left for them TO find a new home.While the leadership aboard the ARK, does not want want war, the military leader aboard the ARK, is not willing to wait. He overthrows the ARK'S leaders, & launches the full scale invasion of Terra.It is only through the friendship of the Terrian Mala & the human, James Stanton, the complete genocide of the Terrians is avoided, though not without without a terrible price being paid.The storyline is driving all through this movie-the desperation of the humans, & the determination of the Terrians.

I like animated movies and I'm 40. I have a daughter who's 8 and a son who's 4.Quickly I realized that what the animators have done with this movie was mind-blowing. The animation is tremendous. The world that they have created is beautiful, full and rich. See, the creators have created this alternate world with what we eventually learn is an alien environment that lives in peace until they are invaded without warning. Invaded by who? Of course, humans. The most violent and peaceless inhabitants of the god created world.Technically, I WOULD give this movie 4 stars just on the creativity and beauty alone. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. The battles between the crude Terrian flying apparatus and the high tech human battle planes are amazing. Yet, the movie is also way too self important for its own good. There's almost an arrogance in the way the story is told. It's heavy, depressing and needed to desperately find some fun to break the drag.Which leads me to why I give the movie 3 stars. My 8-year old lost interest 30 minutes in and my 4-year old maybe five minutes in. I understand that the movie isn't intended to be a kid movie, but it didn't have to be boring.

Human beings are usually the victims of some evil alien power. It's nice to see the tables turned for once and witness human beings as the oppressors, or bad guys.This is truly a profound and subversive story. Too bad it was shown on only one screen in a metropolitan area with 1 1/2 million people! It deserves to have been seen by a much wider audience!While watching Battle for Terra, I asked myself repeatedly, ""What would I do in a similar situation?"" I realize I will never be a soldier in a critical battle that will determine the destiny of the human race.

Large-screen TV owners, take note: This one has a big, bold look that will look great sprayed across your wall-sized screens.Even with my more modest screen, there was much here to love, not least of which was a compelling story with some real meat to it.  And some real grit in the telling.  This is a story that young children will find too intense, but those mature enough to handle it will find that they are not being talked down to or pandered to.  They are treated instead to a gripping tale of sacrifice, values, courage, friendship, compromise, loyalty, cooperation...a great many virtues.  And yet, even stuffed full of terrific virtue lessons, the story never feels like mere propaganda, or some morality story parading around as entertainment.The reviewer who gave ""Terra"" one star seems to think the movie villifies humans and especially the human military, but this is a fairly banal complaint since the human hero is also in the military, and what is really coming under attack is a casual disregard for the ""the other"" in seeking to assert power.There are political components to the story, it is true, but they are blessedly integrated into an honest-to-goodness once-upon-a-time story.  This is not a tract.  This is a myth with lovable characters, loathsome characters, heroes, baddies, and breathtaking scenes of arial beauty and the carnage of Star Wars-style dogfights.I have seen few movies in 2009 that I could recommend more highly than ""Terra""--""Up"" being a notable exception,and for many of the same reasons.

If you've seen the design of the Terrans you might think this film is silly or only for kids.  It's not. It's great, moving, beautiful to look at and probably the best Sci-Fi movie and animated film I've seen in quite some time. This film has an ending that no Pixar or Dreamworks director would touch.  It doesn't leave you with that empty feeling like a lot of animated films do - at feeling of disconnect.  It's a  heart-felt film with big ideas.  As one reviewer said, it made me think ""What would I do it a situation like this?""  If you're worried about the celebrity voices or stunt casting, don't.  David Cross is perfect and actually quite serious in his role.  Evan Rachel Wood makes you care for her Terran character.  James Garner is haunting as an elder Terran.  Justin Long is funny as usual.  Luke Wilson was a surprise as well.  The director has created a perfect little world that I want to go back to again and I might just upgrade to Blu-ray for this movie alone.  The music is terrific.

Why does the ""official"" review seem to have been written with someone with no eye for art or appreciation of what the vast majority of us can obviously see?The combination of mesmerizingly beautiful animation, equally beautiful soundrack, and characters that I could feel for drew me in right from the start.  And then there's a story that at least tries to be original and not rehash of something else.  I couln't see the plot coming at me minutes away as with some sci-fi stuff that's out there.  And, it's a way smarter movie than any of the Star Wars movies were.  Combine that with competant and experienced voice actors, and a cute robot (OK, that's been done to death, but it's a really cute robot) and this is truly a Sci-Fi movie with everything.Warning, spoilers below.From what I read about this movie, I went into it expecting it to be anti-military environmentalist propaganda.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that there really isn't is totally ""good"" side or a totally ""evil"" side in this Battle for Terra.  The suposedly ""evil"" humans are motivated by desperation and the need to act quickly to find a new home (I won't give away why).  And, the supposedly ""good"" and peace-loving Terrans seem to be pacifists at first, and many of them are, but they can afford to be due to the forward and not-so-pacifistic thinking of some of their leadership.I suppose the only thing that mars this overall effect of this movie for me is that I thought the human characters were not animated in much detail.  They looked more like humans looked when the 3D animation genre first started, rather primitive and free of detail.  That was sort of disappointing, but I got over it fast.So, why isn't everyone talking about this one?  One look at the reviews here says that there are many messages one could take away from this movie.  It's something adults, and more mature children (it really isn't for the little ones), could watch and spend all of dinner the next evening talking about.

If you compare it with say, Titan A.E. from almost ten years ago, you can see how much the animation technology has changed in that time. Titan A.E., although great for its time, looked more like an animated cartoon. This movie looks like they're shooting actual 3D models, the figures and sets are so realistic and lifelike. It's a totally different world, literally.Even technically difficult lighting effects such as reflections and even specular highlights are rendered realistically, which many world-class painters have trouble rendering (Vermeer and van Eyck are two of the greats who could do this well). As if this wasn't enough, at the very end of the movie, amazingly, some erudite visual jokester inserted chromatic distortions that look like the internal reflections typical of compound optical lenses, which various high-tech optical coatings are designed to minimize, as if the movie was shot with a real film camera. Too funny.I was mostly interested in seeing how the CGI had come along, and  as you can see I certainly wasn't disappointed there. But the story line is interesting and atypical in that here the Earthlings are the bad guys, trying to kill off a peaceful, intelligent species so that we can take over their world after the Earth was destroyed by war. Does this sound familiar to anyone? Maybe humans will finally realize they're not warm, fuzzy, nice, lovable creatures after all, but instinctive hunters and killers who need to learn to constrain their violent impulses if the human race is to have a future at all in this now overcrowded and increasingly resource-strained world.So overall a visually appealing movie with a message that I would completely agree with.",5,Outstanding,1256515200,"10 26, 2009",2009,1840,"['really', 'beautiful', 'visually', 'appealing', 'movie', 'war', 'peaceful', 'race', 'warlike', 'humans', 'who', 'attack', 'planet', 'compare', 'say', 'Titan', 'A.E', 'almost', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'animation', 'technology', 'changed', 'time', 'Titan', 'A.E.', 'great', 'time', 'looked', 'more', 'animated', 'cartoon', 'movie', ""'re"", 'shooting', 'actual', '3D', 'models', 'figures', 'sets', 'are', 'so', 'realistic', 'lifelike', 'totally', 'different', 'world', 'literally.Even', 'technically', 'difficult', 'lighting', 'effects', 'such', 'reflections', 'even', 'specular', 'highlights', 'are', 'rendered', 'realistically', 'many', 'world-class', 'painters', 'have', 'trouble', 'rendering', 'Vermeer', 'van', 'Eyck', 'are', 'two', 'greats', 'who', 'could', 'do', 'well', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'amazingly', 'erudite', 'visual', 'jokester', 'inserted', 'chromatic', 'distortions', 'look', 'internal', 'reflections', 'typical', 'compound', 'optical', 'lenses', 'various', 'high-tech', 'optical', 'coatings', 'are', 'designed', 'minimize', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'real', 'film', 'camera', 'Too', 'funny.I', 'was', 'mostly', 'interested', 'seeing', 'how', 'CGI', 'had', 'come', 'along', 'can', 'see', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'there', 'story', 'line', 'interesting', 'atypical', 'here', 'Earthlings', 'are', 'bad', 'guys', 'trying', 'kill', 'off', 'peaceful', 'intelligent', 'species', 'can', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'Earth', 'was', 'destroyed', 'war', 'sound', 'familiar', 'anyone', 'Maybe', 'humans', 'will', 'finally', 'realize', ""'re"", 'not', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'nice', 'lovable', 'creatures', 'instinctive', 'hunters', 'killers', 'who', 'need', 'learn', 'constrain', 'violent', 'impulses', 'human', 'race', 'have', 'future', 'now', 'overcrowded', 'increasingly', 'resource-strained', 'world.So', 'visually', 'appealing', 'movie', 'message', 'would', 'completely', 'agree']",Battle for Terra

In both movies mankind has stumbled upon a planet that is useful for humanity, but is occupied by a native species.  In both movies, mankind decides to take the alien planet by force, and do so by killing of the natives.  And in both movies, a human soldier befriends a local female, gets converted to the native side, and helps to fight against his own people.  So two very similar movies, but with very different results at the box office.Whereas Avatar is a heavyweight among recent films, Terra disappeared from the big screen soon after it debuted, and received minimal notice from critics.  Personally, I agree with its failure.  For a movie made in 2007 with state of the art special effects, the film suffers from horrible screen-writing.  First of, the aliens speak English.  Yes, there is another planet in this Galaxy occupied by aliens that speak perfect American English.  Second, they have very American habits, such as public schools, rebellious teenagers, kids who don't like their parents' cooking, rulers who like to hide facts from their people, etc...  Third, it is quite easy to tell the male aliens from the female aliens.  Seeing that most people would not be able to distinguish a male dolphin from a female dolphin, or a male crocodile from a female crocodile, even though dolphins and crocodiles are familiar animals on Earth, why would this movie's producers go to the trouble to make the aliens so easily recognizable as boys and girls.  Now all this would be ok if the movie was comedy, such as in Planet 51.  But for a ""serious"" movie, these clear white-washes suspend belief.

The villains aren't invaders, but themselves.)Of all the movies mentioned, AVATAR is of course the biggest and knock-you-out $lick; but BATTLE FOR TERRA is more empathetic and touching. It seems so because it's more compassionate and, truthfully, smaller. It's not preachy or tuned for violence but concentrates on beings' beliefs, motives and feelings.

1267197,ADLN37B0153N,B002FVPFU2,Silmarwen,"[6, 13]","I didn't like this movie. I felt that it was too slow, too boring and too preachy. The message that the creators were trying to convey is about as subtle as a sledgehammer. In one corner we have the Terraians, a tadpole-like flying race of aliens who live on Terra. They are peaceful and welcome all that life brings. They treasure the arts and are very creative and intuitive. They live in harmony with nature and have created a beautiful life and a beautiful world. In the other corner we have Earth's refugees. Apparently, we have not only destroyed our own planet by using up all of our natural resources, but we destroyed two colonies and Earth through war. Now we have spent a lifetime traveling throughout the galaxy in search of a planet that we can colonize and found one in Terra. There is just one problem: the Terraians. Enter crazy military general who executes a military coup and decides that the best thing to do is change the atmosphere on the planet so that it is oxygen-rich, which will kill the Terraians. Of course, one Terraian and one Earthling meet, get along, save each others' lives, realize that all life is precious, blah, blah, blah. You know the drill.For me, this was a slow-paced, fairly blandly animated environmentally self-conscious film. I felt that the creators were much more interested in getting across their political agenda (military is bad, war is terrible, nature is all that is important and will bring peace, don't overuse resources, all life is valuable, etc.) that they forgot to make an interesting story to feature the agenda to keep people watching. I admit that I paused the movie several times to read some book chapters, go out to lunch, etc. Then I had to brace myself to turn the movie back on -- and it is only an hour and a half! It felt like longer. Also, it was difficult for me to relate to the characters as they were animated in such a bland, Barbie-doll like way. I guess I shouldn't say that about Barbie, I mean her animated movies feature characters with more expression than these guys. The faces were very dough-like and featureless. They really showed no emotions. I felt the most emotion from the little robot-helper guy who at least brought a little bit of charm to the film.The battle sequences are pretty cool and actually caused me to bump by rating up by 0.5 stars. They are a little bit intense for younger viewers. It is also pretty clear that people are dying. It is kind of like the Star Wars: A New Hope movie where you see people in their cockpits and then a big explosion around them and they are just gone. I know other reviewers have said that you may want to be careful about younger viewers as these scenes may be too much for younger kids and they might get scared, but, if you are watching this on your TV at home, I wouldn't worry. Perhaps if you were watching it in a movie theatre where it is big and overwhelming, but it is not that scary.Anyway, I was not happy with the ending of the movie. I always feel that a little bit of diplomacy goes a long way. I hate that the military is always portrayed as the bad guy in science fiction movies. They are doing what they do: protect and defend. Without the proper intel, they screw up. They are people too, they just have guns to back up their point of view. So I feel that the other humans on board the ship needed to push for some more recon and for information on the natives of the planet before they went in with guns blazing. It was pretty clear the Terraians, while airborne, were a peaceful people. There were no signs of weapons and no threats made towards Earth's gunships. I get frustrated with movies like this one because no one can win. Everyone loses. It just goes to show that, with better diplomats, and a more concerted effort to understand other cultures, we would know a lot more peace.",2,Too Preachy for My Taste,1274745600,"05 25, 2010",2010,3845,"['did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'felt', 'was', 'too', 'slow', 'too', 'boring', 'too', 'preachy', 'message', 'creators', 'were', 'trying', 'convey', 'as', 'subtle', 'sledgehammer', 'one', 'corner', 'have', 'Terraians', 'tadpole-like', 'flying', 'race', 'aliens', 'who', 'live', 'Terra', 'are', 'peaceful', 'welcome', 'life', 'brings', 'treasure', 'arts', 'are', 'very', 'creative', 'intuitive', 'live', 'harmony', 'nature', 'have', 'created', 'beautiful', 'life', 'beautiful', 'world', 'other', 'corner', 'have', 'Earth', 'refugees', 'Apparently', 'have', 'not', 'only', 'destroyed', 'own', 'planet', 'using', 'up', 'natural', 'resources', 'destroyed', 'two', 'colonies', 'Earth', 'war', 'Now', 'have', 'spent', 'lifetime', 'traveling', 'galaxy', 'search', 'planet', 'can', 'colonize', 'found', 'one', 'Terra', 'just', 'one', 'problem', 'Terraians', 'Enter', 'crazy', 'military', 'general', 'who', 'military', 'coup', 'best', 'thing', 'do', 'change', 'atmosphere', 'planet', 'oxygen-rich', 'will', 'kill', 'Terraians', 'course', 'one', 'Terraian', 'one', 'Earthling', 'meet', 'get', 'along', 'save', 'others', 'lives', 'realize', 'life', 'precious', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'know', 'drill.For', 'was', 'slow-paced', 'fairly', 'blandly', 'animated', 'environmentally', 'self-conscious', 'film', 'felt', 'creators', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'interested', 'getting', 'political', 'agenda', 'military', 'bad', 'war', 'terrible', 'nature', 'important', 'will', 'bring', 'peace', 'do', ""n't"", 'overuse', 'resources', 'life', 'valuable', 'etc', 'forgot', 'make', 'interesting', 'story', 'feature', 'agenda', 'keep', 'people', 'watching', 'admit', 'paused', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'read', 'book', 'chapters', 'go', 'out', 'lunch', 'etc', 'Then', 'had', 'brace', 'turn', 'movie', 'back', 'only', 'hour', 'half', 'felt', 'longer', 'Also', 'was', 'difficult', 'relate', 'characters', 'were', 'animated', 'such', 'bland', 'Barbie-doll', 'way', 'guess', 'should', ""n't"", 'say', 'about', 'Barbie', 'mean', 'animated', 'movies', 'feature', 'characters', 'more', 'expression', 'guys', 'were', 'very', 'dough-like', 'featureless', 'really', 'showed', 'emotions', 'felt', 'most', 'emotion', 'little', 'robot-helper', 'guy', 'who', 'least', 'brought', 'little', 'bit', 'charm', 'film.The', 'battle', 'sequences', 'are', 'pretty', 'cool', 'actually', 'caused', 'bump', 'rating', 'up', '0.5', 'stars', 'are', 'little', 'bit', 'intense', 'younger', 'viewers', 'also', 'pretty', 'clear', 'people', 'are', 'dying', 'kind', 'Star', 'Wars', 'New', 'Hope', 'movie', 'where', 'see', 'people', 'cockpits', 'then', 'big', 'explosion', 'are', 'just', 'gone', 'know', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'may', 'want', 'be', 'careful', 'younger', 'viewers', 'scenes', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'younger', 'kids', 'might', 'get', 'scared', 'are', 'watching', 'TV', 'home', 'would', ""n't"", 'worry', 'Perhaps', 'were', 'watching', 'movie', 'theatre', 'where', 'big', 'overwhelming', 'not', 'scary.Anyway', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'ending', 'movie', 'always', 'feel', 'little', 'bit', 'diplomacy', 'long', 'way', 'hate', 'military', 'always', 'portrayed', 'bad', 'guy', 'science', 'fiction', 'movies', 'are', 'doing', 'what', 'do', 'protect', 'defend', 'proper', 'intel', 'screw', 'up', 'are', 'people', 'too', 'just', 'have', 'guns', 'back', 'up', 'point', 'view', 'feel', 'other', 'humans', 'board', 'ship', 'needed', 'push', 'more', 'recon', 'information', 'natives', 'planet', 'went', 'guns', 'blazing', 'was', 'pretty', 'clear', 'Terraians', 'airborne', 'were', 'peaceful', 'people', 'were', 'signs', 'weapons', 'threats', 'made', 'towards', 'Earth', 'gunships', 'get', 'frustrated', 'movies', 'one', 'one', 'can', 'win', 'Everyone', 'just', 'show', 'better', 'diplomats', 'more', 'concerted', 'effort', 'understand', 'other', 'cultures', 'would', 'know', 'lot', 'more', 'peace']",Battle for Terra

This recent trend of 5.1 Uncompressed PCM on Blu is a nice change, and it bodes well for an action filled finale like this. The clarity, colors and style of animation look great here, and I bookmarked the last 17 minute battle scene for customers and that alone has sold itself. The supplements are a bit mismanaged and include:* 4:45 minute making-of. Way too short for what this film took to make, and most of the other extras should have been spliced into this selection.* 4 deleted scenes totaling 7 minutes. For what this film was they all should have been left in their respective sequences.* 25 second quip on a storyboard to final rendering analysis on one scene.* 2:13 minute Animatics picture in picture clip. Shows the animation changes between production levels of the escape sequence.* 20 slides containing text and and drawing notes of initial production design.* Pulling the Strings, 1:26 minute low grade animation clip of the director stating his reasons for making this and other films and what he hopes to accomplish.* Crew commentary, catered to the animation followers.The menu is eye catching and plays with some decent music. The navigation is too extensive for younger viewers and could have been made much simpler regarding the supplements (combine everything next time). This gets a 5 rating for Lionsgate on a solid picture and sound product. A PG rating with maybe a few scary moments for really young viewers, but presentable to everyone, I think.

Both deal with humans trying to forcibly get what they want from an alien world with no thought for it's inhabitance.  Both have a soldier starting out only fallowing orders, but who eventually becomes an champion for the plight of the alien populace.  The similarities go on and on to the point that one really starts to wonder if AVATAR shouldn't have given a ""Based On"" nod to BATTLE FOR TERRA for inspiring it (oh, and in case you're thinking to yourself that it might be the other way around, and that TERRA copied AVATAR's story, just keep in mind that TERRA took over 4 years to make, which is years before AVATAR was made.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This movie is a reversal of the old, ""Alien Invasion"" clich&eacute;, where instead of our home world being invaded by aliens, we are the invading force on a peaceful planet after wars have destroyed our own world.There is a good moral core at the center of this film and even though the situations in this tale seem black and white (or cut and dry) there are variant shades of grey permeating the story, making nothing seem forced for story continuity, or even easy for the sake of not asking the tough questions.Also take note that even though the animation might seem oriented towards the small fry, the story has a slightly more complex underlying theme to it that (although the small fry will no doubt enjoy it) is aiming for a wider audience, and does succeed.I've read a review where someone loosely compared this film to WALL-E, and I'd say that in certain aspects there are some similar flavorings (i.e. animation style to an extent, and the preservation of nature) but this film nicely stands on it's own in both ideas and execution.So if you're looking for a nice little slice of epic story telling, done with a lot of heart and soul, then this film will not let you down.",5,THIS IS WHERE AVATAR (STOLED) GOT IT'S IDEA FROM,1253664000,"09 23, 2009",2009,2148,"['**NOTE', 'Having', 'just', 'recently', 'watched', 'AVATAR', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'discover', 'was', 'just', 'better', 'FX', 'version', 'BATTLE', 'FOR', 'TERRA', 'slight', 'comical', 'bits', 'supplied', 'robot', 'better', 'story', 'elements', 'supplied', 'writers', 'deal', 'humans', 'trying', 'forcibly', 'get', 'what', 'want', 'alien', 'world', 'thought', 'inhabitance', 'have', 'soldier', 'starting', 'out', 'only', 'fallowing', 'orders', 'who', 'eventually', 'champion', 'plight', 'alien', 'populace', 'similarities', 'go', 'point', 'one', 'really', 'wonder', 'AVATAR', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'given', 'Based', 'nod', 'BATTLE', 'FOR', 'TERRA', 'inspiring', 'oh', 'case', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'might', 'be', 'other', 'way', 'TERRA', 'copied', 'AVATAR', 'story', 'just', 'keep', 'mind', 'TERRA', 'took', 'over', '4', 'years', 'make', 'years', 'AVATAR', 'was', 'made.', '-This', 'movie', 'reversal', 'old', 'Alien', 'Invasion', 'clich', 'eacute', 'where', 'instead', 'home', 'world', 'being', 'invaded', 'aliens', 'are', 'invading', 'force', 'peaceful', 'planet', 'wars', 'have', 'destroyed', 'own', 'world.There', 'good', 'moral', 'core', 'center', 'film', 'even', 'situations', 'tale', 'seem', 'black', 'white', 'cut', 'dry', 'are', 'variant', 'shades', 'grey', 'permeating', 'story', 'making', 'nothing', 'seem', 'forced', 'story', 'continuity', 'even', 'easy', 'sake', 'not', 'asking', 'tough', 'questions.Also', 'take', 'note', 'even', 'animation', 'might', 'seem', 'oriented', 'small', 'fry', 'story', 'slightly', 'more', 'complex', 'underlying', 'theme', 'small', 'fry', 'will', 'doubt', 'enjoy', 'aiming', 'wider', 'audience', 'succeed.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'review', 'where', 'someone', 'loosely', 'compared', 'film', 'WALL-E', ""'d"", 'say', 'certain', 'aspects', 'are', 'similar', 'flavorings', 'i.e', 'animation', 'style', 'extent', 'preservation', 'nature', 'film', 'nicely', 'own', 'ideas', 'execution.So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'nice', 'little', 'slice', 'epic', 'story', 'telling', 'done', 'lot', 'heart', 'soul', 'then', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'down']",Battle for Terra
