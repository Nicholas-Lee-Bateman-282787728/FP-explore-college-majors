A great story that is less about saving the world and more about the characters, very little CGI, and lots of claw-slashing, all the while staying true to the spirit of the comic character.  I think Wolverine works best in exactly this kind of film, and Mangold pulled it off very, very well.  The last act wasn't the best in that it strayed from all the things that made the first 2/3 great, but it's forgivable, certainly compared to previous X-Men films.

1581717,A3KA2MOVBHFWVR,B0090SI56Y,Adam,"[8, 12]","A superhero movie that isn't setting up a franchise or deeply invested in continuing it is rare nowadays. The Wolverine, a mostly stand-alone film with a slow enough pace to feel like a solid film, is a nice throwback to those quaint days of yore, when times weren't so tough that movie studios felt pressured into creating a billion-dollar industry out of every film they created.The Wolverine takes its title character, the most popular X-Man, and puts him in Tokyo, Japan for a story-line that starts in Nagasaki, 1945, when the immortal Logan saves a Japanese soldier from the atomic bomb. The man offers to repay Logan in the present by taking away his immortality. Then the elderly soldier's son, hired archer, granddaughter, the granddaughter's adopted sister, and the granddaughter's fiance all turn out to have a part to play, and all fight Wolverine at some point. The plot is naturally over-complicated, but it's still fun, with good action scenes and locations. The stakes are solid: since it's a story with almost entirely new characters, any of them can die. Most of them do.One of the main villains, the Viper, is a woman with snake-like mutant abilities such as breathing poison and shedding her skin. Her motivations weren't very clear: she's working for the grandfather, but there isn't much of an explanation for why and how he found her specifically. Wolverine's loss of immortality is also a little suspect, as he still retains the ability to shrug off multiple bullet and stab wounds. Sure, it's because his power was only `suppressed' and it's plausible that the Viper's knowledge of biology was needed to help the grandfather's ailing health, but those are explanations designed to prop up the real reason, which is that both plot decisions lend to better action scenes.The tone of the film is dark, but humorously so, with Hugh Jackman giving his character the same sardonic, tough-guy attitude that is just like the comic book version of Wolverine. His character is still a lot of fun to watch, and the supporting characters, which include Rila Fukushima as Yukio, the female ninja who insists on acting as Wolverine's bodyguard.The film's credits scene is the most ridiculous, sequel-hooky one I've ever seen: Professor X and Magneto both make an appearance, despite barely being referenced in the entire film. I saw The Wolverine with a friend who had never seen any of the other five X-Man films before this one, and he was utterly confused to see Gandalf and Jean-Luc Picard show up. For those in the know, however, it just sets up the next film. It's very out of place in this film, but since it doesn't show up til the end, it doesn't ruin anything.The Wolverine is a fun movie, if you want a superhero film that is a little different from the rest of them. The director brings his own ideas to the film, much like Shane Black did with Iron Man 3. Hopefully, Marvel's films and Fox's X-Men films will continue to allow their directors to go in different directions with superheroes in the future, too.

He could play this role until the wheels fall off, or until his knees give out or he needs a hip replacement. The only other actor who can outshine Jackman in a comic book movie is Heath Ledger, and he is pushing up daisies.Where The Wolverine trumps Origins is through the backstory. Here, the movie starts off with Logan at the full peak of his powers. He is a drifter, lone-wolf, shambling through WWII Japan. And then the bomb hits. Logan saves a Japanese soldier from Seppuku, then rushes him to safety. The soldier will not meet Logan again until he is on his death bed. The contrast between grizzly mountain man and ruthless formality of the Yakuza underworld is what makes this movie so special. There are scenes were long conversations take place in Japanese, which is unheard of from a big-budget American blockbuster of this type. The body count is pretty damn high. I watched the PG-13 theatrical cut and was surprised it wasn't slapped with a hard R.The two main enemies Logan encounters are Viper and Silver Samurai. Both are formidable, and both were well-casted and played by their respective actors. This is a classic chase movie overall. Expect lots of explosions, heavy gun fights, and Yakuza in full body-suits. The Wolverine is consistent from start to finish, and doesn't slow down much.

1581757,A2RPZ4DT6O7TBG,B0090SI56Y,A.R. Schultz,"[236, 275]","Comparing ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" to ""The Wolverine"" is like comparing apples to oranges.  They are both about Marvel's burly and animalistic Wolverine, but they could not be any more different.  Origins seemed to explore a bit of Wolvie's past under the framework of the prior X-Men movies (i.e. familiar characters, settings, and themes), but unfortunately it didn't hit home like the prior X-Men films.  The writing fell flat, because 20th Century Fox took odd twists and turns with fan favorites like Gambit and Deadpool and then never expanded on them in future films like they promised.  Instead of bridging Wolverine's backstory to the acclaimed X-Men trilogy, Fox ended up widening the gap.However, ""The Wolverine,"" takes an entirely different approach to the eponymous character.  Audiences get to see the Adamantium and claws stripped away in a more emotionally driven film.  Wolverine is facing an existential crisis.  Following the events of ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" filmgoers get to see the Wolverine battle is own mortality, or rather near-immortality, during a series of dream sequences centering-around Jean Grey, which is reprised by award-winning Dutch actor, Famke Janssen.  This creates a great underlying plot, and immediately sets ""The Wolverine"" apart from the other X-Men films.Surprisingly enough, ""The Wolverine"" closely follows the original comic book volume of Wolverine, Chris Claremont and Frank Miller's four-part miniseries, that set the tone and standard for Wolverine and his story arcs.  Even though the film is set after the events of ""X-Men: The Last Stand,"" instead of ""X-Men Origins,"" ""The Wolverine"" accurately showcases the events of the 1982 comic book series.  Slight changes have been made to modernize and fit the screenplay into the continuity of the X-Men franchise but on the whole I was incredibly surprised by the amount of source material represented in the movie.Following the conclusion of ""X-Men: The Last Stand,"" in which Jean Grey (aka the Phoenix) is killed by Wolverine in order to stop her from committing genocide, Wolverine  once again takes to the Canadian Rockies.  Living as an animal, Logan only ever comes down from the mountains to garnish what little supplies that he needs.  After a particularly unjust hunting party pulls Wolverine from his introspection and a mysterious Japanese woman shows up to escort Logan to her adoptive grandfather, the films gains traction.  The remainder of ""The Wolverine"" takes place in Japan with an almost all Japanese cast, and focuses on Wolverine's relationship to a (now) elderly Japanese man who Logan saved during the closing days of World War II after the atomic drop over Nagasaki.Rivals emerge and mutants aid both sides, but at its heart ""The Wolverine"" is primarily focused on Wolverine.  It discusses his mental state after killing Jean, his own mortality as he confronts an old acquaintance, and ultimately his place in an ever shifting world.  Hugh Jackman portrays the character perfectly.  He is, for lack of a better phrase, the only actor that could ever play Wolverine.  He is the best he is at what he does.Aside from the phenomenal adaptation and Jackman's performance, the action sequences are tight and the revelations are legitimately surprising.  There are only a handful of lines that came off forced or cheesy, but they can be forgiven considering the overall quality of the film.  The pacing is so smooth and cyclical, that I personally had difficulties telling where the climax of the film landed; this left me without a frame of reference.  Usually I can tell when the conclusion is eminent, but this time around I had difficulties nailing it down.  I think that this is a byproduct of closely adapting a mini-series into a film.  It felt more like a series of mini-climaxes akin to the conclusion of four separate issues culminating in the finale of a series.  Regardless, the flow was appropriate and I never felt that the film hung in exposition or action for too long.  It had great balance.This is a solid superhero film that pays homage to its source material better than most and keeps with the character's integrity after nearly fifteen years.  Cheers to Hugh Jackman and the whole crew for ""The Wolverine.""  ""The Wolverine"" garnishes four-out-of-five stars.Also, do not forget to stick around for the after the credits scene.  It ties wonderfully into ""X-Men: Days of Future Past,"" which is slated to release May of 2014.

The Japanese backdrop was fantastic, and reminded me of the great yakuza & Samurai films of the past (actually sharing some similarities with the jointly produced American/Japanese Classic film from the 1970's starring the Legendary Ken Takakura and Robert Mitchum, called appropriately the `Yakuza' directed by Sydney Pollack, written by the Brilliant Paul Schrader = who went on to direct the equally brilliant, but somewhat disturbing:  ""Mishima, A Life in Four Chapters"")!In 1982, I did read the original `Wolverine' 4-issue mini-series, with the Great Frank Miller artwork (on which a lot of this film is based - although there are many differences, as well). As I recall, the comics had a slightly more intimate setting (and more personal focus on the Japanese characters, and culture - with the climactic battle being an extremely intense, one-on-one `Sword against Claw,' fight to the finish - awesome, though a little gruesome!)I really enjoyed this film, and thought the two Japanese actresses were both charismatically intriguing (especially the spunky Rila Fukushima in the role of Yukio, although Tao Okamoto, who plays Mariko, is sublimely beautiful)!!My only slight complaint (but also true of many big-budget `action' films) is that the Finale had too Large a dose of those `overblown' special effects (particularly with the gigantic CGI Silver Samurai). Too bad, because what made many of the original/ Classic 1960's and 1970's `Yakuza' and `Samurai' films (especially the ones made in Japan) so compelling & exciting, were precisely those intimately intense one-on-one swordfights at the end = ie.

Xmen Origins and First Class weren't quite as good, after the first three Xmen movies, the series started going downhill.  I was really looking forward to this movie coming out, and couldn't wait to see it in 3D.  There aren't too many 3D movies on the market which are not kids movies, so I looked forward to expanding my 3D collection.  However after watch this movie, I'm going to IMMEDIATELY sell it!This movie was completely flawed; Wolverine's character didn't care strongly for ""homosapians"", just mutants.  His character certainly wouldn't have gone to Japan just to say goodbye to a Japanese man he saved.  Even going to a non-mutant's funeral in the U.S. is a stretch, no less an entire country away and then stay there after the funeral to randomly protect that man's granddaughter.  I really don't know what the producers were thinking, they developed his demeanor to be non-caring of others; and developed his past in Xmen Origins and First Class to further instill in the audience that after all he has been through, he will only look out for himself.  This movie defamed a great series that had a lot of potential.After the first three movies, the Xmen series had a promising future and the ending of Xmen: the Last Stand foreshadowed what's to come, or what should have came.  Instead the producers took the series in a different direction and decided to make the series turn into a prequel.  These movies were long, drawn out and slow, which I found hard to watch as the story was being told at a painfully slow rate.  However Origins and First Class still gave a good background to the series and explained more about the characters, a mistake that made this movie a red flag, something that Wolverine would never do.I was surprised to find that the entire movie took place in Japan and that none of the characters from the previous Xmen movies were in it.  Instead this movie consisted of a random assortment of Japanese characters.  This movie was painfully slow to watch as the entire movie was drawn out way too much, made no sense, did not follow the series at all and gave no insight into the Xmen characters as the two prior Xmen movies did.  This movie was completely random and is a spin off of the original Xmen movies; I have no clue what the producers where thinking when they made this movie.  If their goal was to turn the Xmen series into a Japanese cartoon, well then, it was a success.  It's unfortunate that I can not return this movie now that I opened and realized it, instead I will have to sell it used and take a loss.

I'll have to be honest though, despite being a fan of superheroes, even I've grown tired of them. It isn't that I don't enjoy the movies, but it seems that it is the entirety of what Hollywood is putting out anymore. ""The Wolverine"" is another addition to the successful ""X-Men"" series. Personally, I find the X-Men to be one of Stan Lee's richest comic book series' due to the uniqueness of the characters and the more complicated stories that come with them.For some reason though, despite the richness of all the characters from the X-Men, it is only Logan, ""The Wolverine"", who was cool enough to get two solo-movies. While most of the X-Men fans salivate about the Wolverine, I find him to be less intriguing then some of the other characters. He's invincible. Every time he's wounded, he heals himself. I guess that's why I always found Batman more interesting than Superman as well.Fortunately though, the creators of ""The Wolverine"" tapped into the one thing that is Logan's weakness, his own mind and his immortal thoughts. This outing has Logan haunted by the death of Jean Gray, a death that happened in the terrible final ""X-Men"" trilogy movie, ""Last Stand"". His life as an immortal has become daunting and he has nothing to live for. So when a man from his past seeks him out, he travels to Japan to begin a new chapter in his long unending life.""The Wolverine"" is certainly gifted with one thing that most of these superhero movies have seemed to be challenged to achieve. It has a relatively good and complicated story to tell. Another thing that is rewarding about the movie is the placement of events in Japan. The movie is drenched in Japanese culture, ninjas and traditions and I found it to be a fantastic mix with the troubled Wolverine and his retractable blades. Plus it took what we usually think a superhero movie to be and used some creativity in a new environment.""The Wolverine"" isn't a great superhero movie but it is certainly one of the better ones and it gets the ""X-Men"" series back in line for, wait for it, more movies to come. In what has been a dismal summer of movies, it is sort of unfortunate to say that ""The Wolverine"" is probably one of the better movies thus far.

1581819,A1X5MSSAPEY92J,B0090SI56Y,C.Raven,"[2, 4]","The Wolverine retraces the steps of its title character from World War II to the present day, with ghosts of his past haunting him in the forms of a flawless (even if she is dead) Jean Grey and a Japanese soldier he saved from nuclear obliteration in Nagasaki. Standard Marvel Studios fare, really, but who can argue with a movie starring Marvel's most short-tempered human weapon?Hugh Jackman has got to be taking a pounding from playing Logan all these years. And though his face looks far too old to play such an ageless character, the rest of his body is in fantastic shape. Though many people may not be familiar with his co-stars, they all shine in the film which takes place in Tokyo and Nagasaki. Logan's main rivals in the film are Viper, a biochemist with a wicked kiss and an immunity and intimate knowledge of toxins, played by the gorgeous Svetlana Khodchenkova (from the European film Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, 2011); and the scheming son of the Yashida empire, Shinigen, portrayed by Hiroyuki Sanada, son of the soldier he saved in Nagasaki almost a century ago. Asian model Tao Okamoto portrays Shinigen's daughter, Mariko, heir to the largest corporation in Asia, and Yukio, who has the ability to forsee a person's death, played by Rila Fukushima who has only appeared in one short film before this blockbuster.Given that most of the screen time is held by actors and actresses who have had very little relative experience, one might assume that The Wolverine is worth passing on. I think that the crew over at Marvel Studios learned their mistakes from X-Men Origins: Wolverine, however, and have brought together a tight, compelling story, even if its action scenes (the bullet train scene, in particular) do seem a little like Wire-Fu. When you watch it (and you will... you know you will) stay tuned after the credits for a scene introducing next year's obligatory X-Men flick, Days of Future Past, a two minute snippet that brings back Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart in a scene that, from start to finish, made the comic geek inside me squeal with glee.",4,Classic Marvel Action-Driven Masterpeice,1375660800,"08 5, 2013",2013,2079,"['Wolverine', 'steps', 'title', 'character', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'present', 'day', 'ghosts', 'past', 'haunting', 'forms', 'flawless', 'even', 'dead', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'Japanese', 'soldier', 'saved', 'nuclear', 'obliteration', 'Nagasaki', 'Standard', 'Marvel', 'Studios', 'fare', 'really', 'who', 'can', 'argue', 'movie', 'starring', 'Marvel', 'most', 'short-tempered', 'human', 'weapon', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'got', 'be', 'taking', 'pounding', 'playing', 'Logan', 'years', 'face', 'far', 'too', 'old', 'play', 'ageless', 'character', 'rest', 'body', 'fantastic', 'shape', 'many', 'people', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'familiar', 'co-stars', 'shine', 'film', 'place', 'Tokyo', 'Nagasaki', 'Logan', 'main', 'rivals', 'film', 'are', 'Viper', 'biochemist', 'wicked', 'kiss', 'immunity', 'intimate', 'knowledge', 'toxins', 'played', 'gorgeous', 'Svetlana', 'Khodchenkova', 'European', 'film', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', '2011', 'scheming', 'son', 'Yashida', 'empire', 'Shinigen', 'portrayed', 'Hiroyuki', 'Sanada', 'son', 'soldier', 'saved', 'Nagasaki', 'almost', 'century', 'ago', 'Asian', 'model', 'Tao', 'Okamoto', 'Shinigen', 'daughter', 'Mariko', 'heir', 'largest', 'corporation', 'Asia', 'Yukio', 'who', 'ability', 'forsee', 'person', 'death', 'played', 'Rila', 'Fukushima', 'who', 'only', 'appeared', 'one', 'short', 'film', 'blockbuster.Given', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'held', 'actors', 'actresses', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'relative', 'experience', 'one', 'might', 'assume', 'Wolverine', 'worth', 'passing', 'think', 'crew', 'Marvel', 'Studios', 'learned', 'mistakes', 'X-Men', 'Origins', 'Wolverine', 'however', 'have', 'brought', 'together', 'tight', 'compelling', 'story', 'even', 'action', 'scenes', 'bullet', 'train', 'scene', 'particular', 'do', 'seem', 'little', 'Wire-Fu', 'When', 'watch', 'will', 'know', 'will', 'stay', 'tuned', 'credits', 'scene', 'introducing', 'next', 'year', 'obligatory', 'X-Men', 'flick', 'Days', 'Future', 'Past', 'two', 'minute', 'snippet', 'back', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'scene', 'start', 'finish', 'made', 'comic', 'geek', 'squeal', 'glee']",N/A

1581822,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B0090SI56Y,C. Sawin,"[9, 19]","""The Wolverine"" may not be a direct sequel to ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" but it will force people to remember a disastrous superhero film from 2009 that they had recessed deep within their memory core. ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" is a mess of a film known for rushing Marvel character favorites Gambit and Deadpool and bringing in a worldwide gross of over $373 million on a $150 million budget despite leaking onto the internet months in advance with incomplete special effects. ""The Wolverine"" hasn't gone without its issues either as Darren Aronofsky was originally attached as director, but was eventually replaced by James Mangold. Take solace in the fact that ""The Wolverine"" is the closest we'll ever get to an excellent Wolverine film.Logan has essentially lost any reason to live in ""The Wolverine."" When he killed Jean, he realized that everyone around him dies while he continues to live with a curse that no man should ever have to carry on his shoulders. Jean, while only appearing in Logan's dreams, seems to almost act as Logan's conscience as she questions the decisions he's making and keeps asking when he'll join her in the afterlife. She serves as a source of encouragement for a way out for Logan, but in reality it's just a piece of the past that Logan can't let go of.There is a ton of story in ""The Wolverine,"" so much that aside from the brief bar sequence at the opening of the film that the action doesn't really pick up for a good 30-40 minutes, but its speedball antics almost seem everlasting at times. The funeral battle that leads to a chase through an arcade as the archer Harada (Will Yun Lee) runs effortlessly on rooftop ledges lasts an incredibly long time. You're barely able to catch your breath when the exhausting speed train sequence kicks in. Jumping ahead, the arrow sequence near the end of the film is packed with exceptional imagery; Japanese rooftops lurking in the background at night, snow lightly falling on the ground, and the way dozens of ninjas attack Logan in this specific scene is just fantastically memorable.The humor is very hit or miss whether it's Logan's scattered use of profanity or Logan feeling violated after his only bath and haircut in the film. Logan and Mariko (Tao Okamoto) stumbling onto a love hotel pushes the film's humor into awkward territory. While Noburo's (Brian Tee) pool scene could be considered the film's funniest scene, the scene where a wounded Logan is tended to by a veterinary student is where the film's flaws interrupt a near pleasant experience up to that point.In the original comics and even in the ""X-Men"" cartoon from the early 90s, Wolverine not only had a history in Japan but also knew Japanese. Obviously some things had to be changed for the live-action films, but Logan not knowing any Japanese at all in ""The Wolverine"" seemed a little ignorant on his part. While the story is surprisingly well developed, is structurally solid, and story points are consistently introduced early on and returned to later, certain characters are really just downright boring. Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) is a key ingredient to Silver Samurai's uprising, but if it wasn't for her snake-like abilities using up the film's special effects budget the character would be nothing more than a Poison Ivy knockoff. While Harada is a really fun character to watch, the way his character is written is awful. He's loyal to one side and then the other because so-and-so is working with them, but then has a change of heart because a childhood friend stabs him in the thigh.Thankfully, the sequence featuring ninjas on motorcycles from the first trailers for the film was removed for the theatrical cut of the film. The trailers also made it seem like Logan would just be cut repeatedly in the facial region throughout the entire film before healing and causing a bunch of drama for some reason. That isn't the case either. The finale of the film is downright fierce, especially the climax of the Silver Samurai/Wolverine battle. It's a shame you don't get to see more of Hiroyuki Sanada as Shingen though. He's mostly very arrogant in his scenes, but he has two extremely intense fight scenes that are incredibly entertaining.The film is loaded with Japanese culture and history, which is one of the reasons the story is as strong as it is. The film isn't exactly a Disney film either as Wolverine bleeds a lot, blood is constantly shown on his claws, and blades are seen piercing through people's torsos, while James Mangold has promised a more violent version on Blu-ray. However, what they do to the Silver Samurai character is tragic. It may make sense for the story, but turning the character into a giant adamantium machine waters down the original character a bit. It reminds you too much of ""Iron Man"" and once you make that connection ""The Wolverine"" seems to have way more in common with ""Iron Man"" than it should.""The Wolverine"" is a vast improvement over ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine."" It's more story driven than its predecessor, utilizes all of the new characters introduced to their full potential, and sets up next year's ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" in a really satisfying way (for the love of Galactus stay through the end credits). ""The Wolverine"" tries so hard to be the best live-action film incarnation of Wolverine out there and it mostly succeeds, but its little issues are just enough to keep the film from being exceptional.",3,May cause impotence and desire to watch bears urinate,1374710400,"07 25, 2013",2013,5428,"['Wolverine', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'direct', 'sequel', 'X-Men', 'Origins', 'Wolverine', 'will',

In the hands of director James Mangold, and the obvious passion of star Hugh Jackman, we finally have the Wolverine film we deserve: a film about the character himself.  Jackman shines; you can tell he's thinking, &#34;Finally, a chance to actually act in this role, instead of go through the motions.&#34;  The action sequences are present and reliably breath-taking; but they never feel over-the-top, until the end.  There isn't much about this movie that is &#34;cartoonish;&#34; the film is made with respect and grace, as opposed to an eye for Box Office grosses.  The focus is on character, on set up, on drawing out tension and not just having things explode.  And when things DO explode, it's with purpose.  (And, on a side note, how cool is it to finally see the Wolverine in some actual peril?  I mean, we all know he's going to make it, they wouldn't kill him off; but oh yes, he can and will hurt quite a bit.)That said, the final thirty minutes feel like a typical comic book film, with Logan facing off against a towering adamantine...thing.  And the mutant Viper seems like a throw-off, ironically until the final act, when she becomes truly creepy and menacing (and, just, weird).  There are plot holes galore, and I'm still scratching my head about a few things.  But overall, this isn't your typical comic book film.  In fact, disregarding Nolan's DARK KNIGHT trilogy, I'd say this is the best comic book film since the first IRON MAN.  At times, it doesn't even feel like a &#34;comic book movie.&#34;  If you like action films that focus on character development, that take their time and don't talk down to the audience, THE WOLVERINE is your film.",4,"""What kind of monster are you?""",1390089600,"01 19, 2014",2014,2465,"['above-par', 'sequel', 'titular', 'hero', 'wandering', 'alone', 'still', 'haunted', 'death', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'bar', 'fight', 'strange', 'Japanese', 'woman', 'who', 'whisks', 'Logan', 'away', 'Tokyo', 'man', 'life', 'saved', 'WWII', 'man', 'Yashida', 'proposal', 'will', 'grant', 'Logan', 'mortality', 'things', 'kind', 'spiral', 'control', 'Now', 'almost', 'mortal', 'Logan', 'must', 'race', 'save', 'Yashida', 'daughter', 'Mariko', 'clutches', 'Yakuza', 'evil', 'mutant.The', 'plot', 'vaguely', 'ridiculous', ""n't"", 'Even', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'yet', 'get', 'film', 'final', 'half', 'hour', 'only', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'can', 'immediately', 'tell', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'opening', 'scene', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'different', 'caliber', 'hands', 'director', 'James', 'Mangold', 'obvious', 'passion', 'star', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'finally', 'have', 'Wolverine', 'film', 'deserve', 'film', 'character', 'Jackman', 'can', 'tell', 'thinking', '34', 'Finally', 'chance', 'actually', 'act', 'role', 'instead', 'go', 'motions.', '34', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'present', 'reliably', 'breath-taking', 'never', 'feel', 'over-the-top', 'end', ""n't"", 'much', 'movie', '34', 'cartoonish', '34', 'film', 'made', 'respect', 'grace', 'opposed', 'eye', 'Box', 'Office', 'grosses', 'focus', 'character', 'set', 'up', 'drawing', 'out', 'tension', 'not', 'just', 'having', 'things', 'explode', 'when', 'things', 'DO', 'explode', 'purpose', 'side', 'note', 'how', 'cool', 'finally', 'see', 'Wolverine', 'actual', 'peril', 'mean', 'know', 'going', 'make', 'would', ""n't"", 'kill', 'off', 'oh', 'yes', 'can', 'will', 'hurt', 'quite', 'bit', 'said', 'final', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'feel', 'typical', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'Logan', 'facing', 'off', 'towering', 'adamantine', 'thing', 'mutant', 'Viper', 'throw-off', 'ironically', 'final', 'act', 'when', 'truly', 'creepy', 'menacing', 'just', 'weird', 'are', 'plot', 'holes', 'galore', ""'m"", 'still', 'scratching', 'head', 'few', 'things', 'overall', ""n't"", 'typical', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'fact', 'disregarding', 'Nolan', 'DARK', 'KNIGHT', 'trilogy', ""'d"", 'say', 'best', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'first', 'IRON', 'MAN', 'times', ""n't"", 'even', 'feel', '34', 'comic', 'book', 'movie.', '34', 'like', 'action', 'films', 'focus', 'character', 'development', 'take', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'audience', 'WOLVERINE', 'film']",N/A

The movie pick ups about two years after X3 and has Logan dealing with the emotional repercussions of what took place in that film. A somewhat quasi-sequel. Other than the memory loss issue prevalent in the original trilogy and explained in Origins, there is no reference to anything about those movies except for the guilt he's dealing with from X3. The rest is totally brought up out of nowhere, cinematically speaking, except flashbacks shown to the audience that Logan doesn't remember until about halfway through the film. The story and action is dragging for most of the film and we don't get the wolverine until three quarters of it is over. There's a romance thrown in there that seems too quick to be believably developed and only purpose being to probably set up Wolverine 3 or 4. They should've just picked up where Origins left off and focused on the brother dynamic between wolverine and sabretooth, but the director said he didn't even want to mention Origins and keep this a stand alone film. Which is interesting as the film definitely had a different style to it than any of the previous films, but the best  part of it, in my opinion, was the post credits scene reminiscent of the original Xmen movie. Anyway, I'll break down this movie in the ranks of how I like the xmen saga: X2 is a five star film, X1 and Origins get four stars, while X3 and this movie get three, as I feel generous today.

No it wasn't a great movie, but it managed to be a fun popcorn flick. When I saw the preview for this film, I decided to give it a pass, nothing about it grabbed my interest. In all honesty, the Wolverine character was always the least interesting of the X-Men mutants, and seems to only work when part of a larger ensemble. Maybe that's why &#34;X-Men: First Class&#34;, the only film in the series which doesn't feature Wolverine is my favorite? They are running this on HBO this month so I thought I would give it a shot.As the film opens we flash back to the end of World War II and a POW camp located just outside of Nagasaki. One of the Japanese officers, named Yashida, is running around freeing all of the Allied POW's. We discover that Wolverine is being held in a deep pit, and is the last person freed by Yashida as the mushroom cloud destroys the city. Wolverine protects the Japanese officer, shielding him from the blast with a sheet of steel and his own body at the bottom of the pit.Jump to the present day and Logan is doing the hermit thing in the woods again (this never works out for him??), when he is summoned back to Japan by Yashida who is know dying. Stricken with cancer, the former Japanese officer is now head of the largest tech firm in Japan. He says the he can lift the &#34;curse&#34; of immortality from Logan, transferring it to his own body and repay the debt he feels he owes to Logan. When Wolverine refuses, the old man's physician, a snake-like mutant named Viper, pays Logan a visit and injects him with something. Logan is told that Yashida has died in the night, and at Yashida's funeral, gangsters try to kidnap Yashida's daughter, Mariko, who is heir apparent to Yashida's fortune. Logan saves the girl and escapes, but not before being wounded. Logan's healing abilities have stopped working, and he and the girl must now run for their lives.Okay, so Wolverine vs. a bunch of ninja sounds totally cool...right?

In the scene where Logan or the Wolverine as he is usually called, was in the apartment with Yukio questioning a high level official, you don't even notice that he doesn't even extend his claws out to put fear in the guy.  The scene was so suspenseful and dramatic that for myself, I had not even noticed that the Wolverine didn't even need to take his claws out.  This says a lot, I believe, on how well done the movie was and all the different scenes.  It didn't need to use the usual special effects or digital effects to keep your interest, even though this was clearly an x men comic book movie, which you would think would require it in each scene.  Another feature of this movie is the character of Yukio played by Rila Fukushima.  I believe in my own view, that she carries the movie practically by herself from the moment she appears.  Even the Wolverine is mesmerized by her martial arts capabilities and appearance the moment he first takes a look at her.  In all the x men movies, you see strong mutant women, but feminine and good looking at the same time.  What is also remarkable about Yukio is that she does not depend on her precognitive mutant abilities in everything she does, but instead has learned the martial arts growing up.  In one scene, she takes a piece of wood out of the ground and uses it as a weapon.  She improvises or takes what is around her to use as a weapon, when she doesn't have a sword available or loses a sword.  She also seems lighter than air as she attacks and jumps off the ground.  This speaks strongly to her martial arts techniques she learned while growing up.  It shows that she is not limited to just using the sword as a weapon of defense or offense.  She has a great personality also.  She is witty, funny, intelligent, and interesting.  She has a great modern female, anime, and almost cosplay (costume play at comic book conventions for those who don't know what I'm saying) look about her, without overdoing it.  I would definitely get the dvd just to see if there are any extras with her in it.  This was a special four part comic book story of the wolverine.  One of the most famous that involves the Wolverine.  I would get the dvd just for that and the character of Yukio as well.  All the characters were great, but in my opinion, I think she really stood out.  She is worthy to be the bodyguard and guide for the Wolverine in my own opinion.",5,The character of Yukio is worth getting this dvd to see if there are any extra features with her in it.,1375833600,"08 7, 2013",2013,2512,"['had', ""n't"", 'noticed', 'when', 'saw', 'clip', 'scene', 'youtube', 'brought', 'back', 'moment', 'scene', 'where', 'Logan', 'Wolverine', 'usually', 'called', 'was', 'apartment', 'Yukio', 'questioning', 'high', 'level', 'official', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', ""n't"", 'even', 'extend', 'claws', 'put', 'fear', 'guy', 'scene', 'was', 'so', 'suspenseful', 'dramatic', 'had', 'not', 'even', 'noticed', 'Wolverine', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'need', 'take', 'claws', 'out', 'lot', 'believe', 'how', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'was', 'different', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'use', 'usual', 'special', 'effects', 'digital', 'effects', 'keep', 'interest', 'even', 'was', 'clearly', 'x', 'men', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'require', 'scene', 'feature', 'movie', 'character', 'Yukio', 'played', 'Rila', 'Fukushima', 'believe', 'own', 'view', 'movie', 'practically', 'moment', 'Even', 'Wolverine', 'mesmerized', 'martial', 'arts', 'capabilities', 'appearance', 'moment', 'first', 'look', 'x', 'men', 'movies', 'see', 'strong', 'mutant', 'women', 'feminine', 'good', 'looking', 'same', 'time', 'What', 'also', 'remarkable', 'Yukio', 'not', 'depend', 'precognitive', 'mutant', 'abilities', 'everything', 'instead', 'learned', 'martial', 'arts', 'growing', 'up', 'one', 'scene', 'piece', 'wood', 'ground', 'weapon', 'what', 'around', 'use', 'weapon', 'when', ""n't"", 'have', 'sword', 'available', 'sword', 'also', 'lighter', 'air', 'ground', 'strongly', 'martial', 'arts', 'techniques', 'learned', 'growing', 'up', 'not', 'limited', 'just', 'using', 'sword', 'weapon', 'defense', 'offense', 'great', 'personality', 'also', 'witty', 'funny', 'intelligent', 'interesting', 'great', 'modern', 'female', 'anime', 'almost', 'cosplay', 'costume', 'play', 'comic', 'book', 'conventions', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'saying', 'look', 'overdoing', 'would', 'definitely', 'get', 'dvd', 'just', 'see', 'are', 'extras', 'was', 'special', 'four', 'part', 'comic', 'book', 'story', 'wolverine', 'One', 'most', 'famous', 'Wolverine', 'would', 'get', 'dvd', 'just', 'character', 'Yukio', 'well', 'characters', 'were', 'great', 'opinion', 'think', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'worthy', 'be', 'bodyguard', 'guide', 'Wolverine', 'own', 'opinion']",N/A

An unexpected summons from his past takes a reluctant Logan to Japan. A dying industrialist named Yashida wishes to thank Logan for saving his life at Nagasaki half a century earlier. But Logan quickly discovers he has wandered into a lethal struggle for control of Yashida Industries, with family members, corrupt officials, and the Yakuzi mob all wanting a share of the action. Logan will try to protect Yashida's granddaughter Mariko with the assistance of the female bodyguard Yukio. And Logan will find himself shockingly vulnerable to unexpected opponents and to betrayal as the action moves from Tokyo to Nagasaki to a dramatic conclusion inside a hidden mountain fortress.&#34;Wolverine&#34; is a bit of a mix. It's fun to see Hugh Jackman inhabiting his Wolverine persona again, and there are some well-staged action sequences, along with some good location shooting in Japan. The movie is unevenly paced, as the action alternates with Logan's attempts to sort out a complicated plot and with introspective sequences in which Logan wrestles with his purpose in life.

1581883,AXO4PQU0XG3TG,B0090SI56Y,Dwight,"[0, 4]","I just got a look at the excel spreadsheet of the prisoner list of Hiroshima POW Camp 6 provided by one of the far east POW websites.As mentioned by a Canadian POW, the Japanese would periodically update the POW photos and records.Those records contain their full names, their next of kin and their home addresses.And I know from the POW memoirs I own that very often American former POWs would find themselve approached by their former Japanese gaolers and in every memoir, the former POWs claim that they accepted the now remorseful just doing his job former tormentor and killer.I also read that Navajo code talkers were contacted decades later by Japanese enemy combatants.So in light of these facts especially that they maintained records on each prisoner including their next of kin usually their wives (and they were so nice to the wives of the British in Hong Kong) and the home addresses, then THIS Wolverine movie is about Japan as deadly frenemy.That's why the Vincent Price lookalike narrator of Cinemasins dings the fact that Wolverine with his heightened senses appears to not SMELL Yukio's presence exactly as he seemed to not SMELL Rogue hiding in his vehicle in the first X-Men movie.He is silent and well mannered as his arm is twisted to fly to Tokyo to see his ""old friend"" his former gaoler who still calls him by an insulting name and pretty much all the Japanese are disrespectful, discourteous and not at all good hosts to him.The original clueless review of a temporary piece of brain candy:I couldn't figure out if this was the only way to get the digital copy of the Extended/Unleashed version with the extra minutes that every review claims makes this movie better.I don't think this movie is worth five dollars nevermind the extra six dollars in order to see the extended but I decided to not upsell myself up to a multidisc with digital copy because since I don't think much of the movie, I have decided to pay the lowest price to get what I genuinely want i..e the extended version.  For the same price, the iTunes version is better because it provides extras BUT here is where ROKU's power is evident.  I simply want to be able to jump from netflix to Amazon Instant Video via the wonderfully responsive  Roku remote.I have the original issues (worthless since they are worn from reading and time) and this movie just is not attractive.  Hugh Jackman always seems too ... poreless to be Wolverine but I do like Liev Schreiber as Sabretooth (he's not in this movie).  COINCIDENTALLY, Liev Schreiber played Hugh Jackman's descendant in this director'sKate And Leopold.  Go figure.The Amazon Instant Video showed up right away on the Roku so there was no problem.I committed to buying the extended version based on this review:http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BMEOALOEUN2E/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN;=B00E4W40C4&channel;=detail-glance&nodeID;=2625373011&store;=movies-tvbut in hindsight, the extra gore may not have made this movie better but at least we know.To me, the best thing about this film is the Russian actress who plays Viper who was lovelier without the heavy makeup inTinker Tailor Soldier Spy.  Here, despite her laudably perfect American accent and delivery (unlike Yukio's inappropriate echoing of Scott Summers' ""You're still a ...."" line to Wolverine), she is definitely Russian and her scene in the street both with the random harasser and the ninja echo the disrespect the Russian female expats experience in Japan and the ninja's threat of giving her a Glasgow smile actually happened to female victims of the Japanese invasion of Asia.This movie despite being set in and about Japan is clearly about the frenemy relationship between the Allies and the Axis.  The villain's offspring are all trained against the kuzuri and you will want to rewatch the film to note all the dishonesty and feigned friendship.It would explain why the residence of the family and the movements of the inhabitants resemble that of a stage play.Interestingly, given Logan's longevity and life experiences, it would not be unlikely that he spots this a mile away as well as enduring Jean Grey's constant psychic trespassing imploring him to suicide.Very much like Pico Iyer, Professor X and Wolverine leave their love interests inAnother Country.For the first time, I found myself liking Hugh Jackman when his character was amusingly sneaky by meekly repeating the standard phrase before eating at the table followed by stabbing his chopsticks upright into his bowl of rice.  Now would he stab his fork into a slice of pot roast and leave it like the American flag planted on the Moon?  So why would he do that to the rice with the chopsticks if not to invite the common CHINESE admonishment followed by the statement from a very unTunguistic looking Japanese fashion model ""Nothing is without meaning.""Well, that stand-in for incense in a bowl in front of the portrait of the deceased is placed OPPOSITE the Japanese female that Wolverine shortly beds a la Mickey Rourke inYear of the Dragon.  And that is why the Chinese character inThe Hawaiiansbecomes Charlton Heston's business partner and a Japanese field hand becomes his wife.The extras in the Japanese crowd scenes look intentionally outdated as if this were set in the 1970s but the technology is modern.  Coincidentally, Wolverine starred inReal Steelechoing the final Boss fight  - also against a Japanese/Russian team.Viper was characterized very well in this film - much better and of course, more glamorously than Ray Park's Toad in the X Men movie.",3,Hiroshima POW Camp 6,1386028800,"12 3, 2013",2013,5544,"['just', 'got', 'look', 'excel', 'spreadsheet', 'prisoner', 'list', 'Hiroshima', 'POW',

He's on a plane for Japan where he must take up the manners he remembered from decades ago during WW2 and live with a purpose.

1581907,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B0090SI56Y,FNDNreview,"[4, 8]","Prior to the release of X-Men: First Class, the X-Men franchise had been on slippery slope.  Both X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine left a great deal to be desired, especially coming off the critical and commercial successes of X-Men and X2: X-Men United.  However, to the credit of Marvel and Fox, neither company gave up on the franchise and have apparently ""righted the ship"" after the (mostly) embraced addition of First Class in 2011.  Even though the later films were faltering, the franchise's main star never shied away from the role that put him on the map.  Aside from Robert Downey Jr., there is no more important face to a comic book franchise than Hugh Jackman.  It's difficult to imagine another actor ever taking over the role of Logan/Wolverine, and despite the major flaws throughout the X-Men films, it's always been a pleasure to watch the evolution of Jackman's character.  In this his sixth appearance as the character and second solo adventure, Jackman once again stars as Marvel's beloved mutant superhero in The Wolverine.***MINOR PLOT DETAILS / POSSIBLE SPOILERS***Directed by James Mangold (Walk the Line, 3:10 to Yuma), The Wolverine stars Hugh Jackman as Logan/Wolverine, who is mentally broken down after the events of X-Men: The Last Stand.  Constantly haunted by visions of his beloved Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), Logan struggles to find meaning in his life - until he is paid a visit from Yukio (Rila Fukushima), a woman with the ability to see the future.  She informs Logan that Ichir&#333; Yashida, a man Logan saved in Japan when the atom bomb was dropped on Nagasaaki in 1945, is dying and wishes to say his final goodbye.  Once in Japan, Yashida informs Logan that he can remove his healing mutation and allow him to finally die - to Logan's surprise.  Fearful for the safety of Yashida's granddaughter (who stands to inherit the family empire after his death), Mariko (Tao Okamoto), Logan takes on the task of protecting her from a group of hired assassins.  Will Yun Lee, Svetlana Khodchenkova, Ken Yamamura, and Hiroyuki Sanada also star in supporting roles.***END MINOR PLOT DETAILS / POSSIBLE SPOILERS***It's relatively safe to say Hugh Jackman was born to play the role of Wolverine.  There is literally no scene to be found in this film - or any other X-Men film - where Jackman's portrayal of Logan is uninteresting or bland.  No, this isn't the Wolverine that many of us know and love from the comic books, but the cinematic version of the character borders on the brooding, temperamental character just enough to satisfy the needs of the plot throughout the course of the franchise.  For the most part, the attitude is right, the overall look of the character is acceptable, and Jackman's Australian accent is completely absent - not mention he's ripped beyond belief.  These vital characteristics continue to allow Jackman to excel at the cinematic role that's he's made famous.  Hopefully, Jackman will continue to answer to the call to play this character well beyond next summer's X-Men sequel.Outside of the praise to Hugh Jackman, The Wolverine is a bit of a mixed bag in terms of plot vs. characters.  The plot of the film is relatively simple and doesn't try to do too much, allotting plenty of time for character development and story progression.  However, the plot severely lacks the presence of a prominent villain.  For all of its flaws, X-Men Origins at least had Victor Creed (Live Schreiber) and William Stryker (Danny Huston) in the driver's seat as clearly visible villains.  The Wolverine's main antagonist is split amongst a handful of characters (and an endless amount of thugs) that is rarely threatening to the well-being of Logan and his abilities.  Speaking of his abilities, Logan is kind of, sort of stripped of his powers (as seen in the trailers, so it's not like this is a spoiler).  This makes for the most bothersome and cluttered portion of the plot, which rarely makes sense, and there's little doubt the film would have been even better had the filmmakers not incorporated it.  Regardless, the Silver Samurai rears his ugly head as a disappointing variation of the classic villain - and even more disappointing is that the character's appearance is specifically reserved for a climactic showdown, meaning he's absent for the majority of the film.  Despite what you think you know about this character and regardless of who plays what on the credit sheet, there is plenty of cloud and misdirection that significantly ignores the comic book version.  So, if you're a major fan of this particular villain, you might want to tapper your expectations.Oddly enough, The Wolverine doesn't seem as action-packed in comparison to previous X-Men films.  Still, there is plenty of action to go around, full of chase sequences and a ton of bad guys bitin' the dust - along with a pretty intense bullet train sequence that is visually impressive, even if it is unrealistic.  Surprisingly, there is quite a bit of downtime between action sequences, which is certainly welcomed and creates for a much more balanced film experience.  Typically, previous X-Men films use their unaccounted free space to incorporate cameos for characters that fans have been clamoring to see - such as Gambit or Juggernaut.  For the most part, The Wolverine is cameo free, making for a sustaining flow of drama, action, and brief moments of humor - which include a pretty humorous scene where Logan is taking a bath.Overall, The Wolverine is a welcome addition to the X-Men franchise and serves as a great continuation after the events of the sub-par third installment, X-Men: The Last Stand.  While that particular film was a bit of a dud, it's nice to see this new standalone adventure didn't completely ignore that film's events. Hugh Jackman continues to own the role of Logan and this character continues to be one of the most entertaining comic book heroes on the big screen.  For once, it was nice to see a film that didn't revolve around the ""mutant crisis,"" which will no doubt be the center of attention in the franchise's next film, X-Men: Days of Future Past.  And - a word of advice:  don't you dare move from your seat until you see the additional scene that happens about midway through the credits.  There's absolutely no debating the fact that this scene alone is worth the price of admission.  It will set up next summer's sequel, and will leave a gigantic smile on the face of every single hardcore X-Men movie and comic book fan out there.GRADE:  BFNDNreview.com",4,Hugh Jackman continues to

Anyone who collected Wolverine comics back in the day knows about his ties to Japan and here they finally touched upon that connection.  This was SO much better than the Origins story they tried to tell, which fell flat and really really did not capture Wolverine.  I didn't believe that storyline for a minute, but this...THIS...is Wolverine.The locations in Japan were great, the action was wonderful (if a bit bloody at times, but heck this is Wolverine we're talking about), and Jackman still looks as hot as ever.  Honestly, I could not see anyone else ever playing this character he has so taken it for his own.Some spoilers below:At the start of the movie, we get a flash back (literally in a way) to WW2 and how Wolverine saves a Japanese guard from the atomic bomb blast.  Back in the present day, Wolverine is holed up in a cave, keeping to himself, terribly hurt and lost after the death of Jean (the Phoenix) and the part he played in that.  He is haunted by visions of Jean and really doesn't seem to care anymore, not about anyone or anything.  He goes into town after some hunters and meets a Japanese girl who tells him the man he once saved is dying and wants to tell him good-bye.  Of course, we all know that isn't just what's going on...Turns out the man he saved is now head of a huge, powerful corporation and wants to make Wolverine a deal.  He wants Logan's power to heal and, in exchange, he will give him what he wants...the ability to die.  Wolverine is also introduced to the man's granddaughter, who he ends up saving after Logan refuses and her grandfather dies.  Once again, Logan is in his natural role as a soldier and protector.  But, this time, he is wounded both in mind and body, as his vaunted healing suddenly seems to be leaving him.  This is a vulnerable Wolverine, the one we always knew was inside the man of adamantium.There are some great samurai fight sequences in this movie and a wild ride/fight on the top of a bullet train.  The locations are fascinating and even funny, as they hole up in a cheezy motel where rooms are rented by the hour.  The definite star of the show remains, of course, Wolverine.  Will he overcome his guilt and longing to die?  Will he no longer be a ronin, a samurai with no master, but re-find himself and what he lives for?As ever, watch through the end credits for a hint of movies yet to come...I can't wait!",5,FINALLY!!!!!!!,1388707200,"01 3, 2014",2014,2528,"['someone', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'loving', 'Wolverine', 'collecting', 'comic', 'books', 'appeared', 'was', 'terrific', 'treat', 'see', 'movie', 'Anyone', 'who', 'collected', 'Wolverine', 'comics', 'back', 'day', 'ties', 'Japan', 'here', 'finally', 'touched', 'connection', 'was', 'SO', 'much', 'better', 'Origins', 'story', 'tried', 'tell', 'fell', 'flat', 'really', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'capture', 'Wolverine', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'storyline', 'minute', 'THIS', 'Wolverine.The', 'locations', 'Japan', 'were', 'great', 'action', 'was', 'wonderful', 'bit', 'bloody', 'times', 'heck', 'Wolverine', ""'re"", 'talking', 'Jackman', 'still', 'as', 'hot', 'ever', 'Honestly', 'could', 'not', 'see', 'anyone', 'else', 'ever', 'playing', 'character', 'so', 'taken', 'own.Some', 'spoilers', 'start', 'movie', 'get', 'flash', 'back', 'literally', 'way', 'WW2', 'how', 'Wolverine', 'Japanese', 'guard', 'atomic', 'bomb', 'blast', 'Back', 'present', 'day', 'Wolverine', 'holed', 'up', 'cave', 'keeping', 'terribly', 'hurt', 'lost', 'death', 'Jean', 'Phoenix', 'part', 'played', 'haunted', 'visions', 'Jean', 'really', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'anymore', 'not', 'anyone', 'anything', 'town', 'hunters', 'Japanese', 'girl', 'who', 'man', 'once', 'saved', 'dying', 'tell', 'good-bye', 'course', 'know', ""n't"", 'just', 'what', 'going', 'out', 'man', 'saved', 'now', 'head', 'huge', 'powerful', 'corporation', 'make', 'Wolverine', 'deal', 'Logan', 'power', 'heal', 'exchange', 'will', 'give', 'what', 'ability', 'die', 'Wolverine', 'also', 'introduced', 'man', 'granddaughter', 'who', 'up', 'saving', 'Logan', 'grandfather', 'dies', 'Once', 'again', 'Logan', 'natural', 'role', 'soldier', 'protector', 'time', 'wounded', 'mind', 'body', 'vaunted', 'healing', 'suddenly', 'be', 'leaving', 'vulnerable', 'Wolverine', 'one', 'always', 'knew', 'was', 'man', 'adamantium.There', 'are', 'great', 'samurai', 'fight', 'sequences', 'movie', 'wild', 'ride/fight', 'top', 'bullet', 'train', 'locations', 'are', 'fascinating', 'even', 'funny', 'hole', 'up', 'cheezy', 'motel', 'where', 'rooms', 'are', 'rented', 'hour', 'definite', 'star', 'show', 'course', 'Wolverine', 'Will', 'overcome', 'guilt', 'longing', 'die', 'Will', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'ronin', 'samurai', 'master', 're-find', 'what', 'ever', 'watch', 'end', 'hint', 'movies', 'yet', 'come', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait']",N/A

1581920,A26IVJJTXOE85B,B0090SI56Y,Georgio Alfani,"[3, 10]","The X-Men brand seems to have sort of worn itself out. Yes, many loved X-Men: First Class, but even that felt a little stale to me on the heels of X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine, neither of which exactly blew the doors off. Granted, I actually don't think any of those are out-and-out disasters as much as I feel the franchise hit such a high note with X2 ten years ago that it has failed to live up to such lofty results ever since. It's easy enough to find a film mildly entertaining, but I have yet to be as impressed as I was with Nightcrawler's attack during the opening of X2, or an X-film that lived up to that film's entirety. Plus the fact the the Wolverine character is the only comic movie character not to wear his classic costume just makes the entire X-Men film franchise like such a waste. Now cue director James Mangold's The Wolverine.As much as everyone disliked 2009's Wolverine feature I found it to be something easily dismissed, yet easily consumed. It didn't really move me one way or another, but early prospects of a Darren Aronofsky-directed follow-up (Aronofsky would eventually leave the project over ""creative differences"") had me thinking we may finally start exploring more interesting territory with a character Hugh Jackman has now played on screen six times and will make it seven in next year's X-Men: Days of Future Past.His origin has been explored, his torment over the death of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), the fact he's a loner and can't control his temper, so what's left? Well, a lot more of all that, though a theme that penetrates the first act involving Logan's struggles of life vs. death are interesting, too bad they are so mishandled the rest of the way.Once again we find Jackman as Logan (aka The Wolverine) brooding and alone. We're witness to memories he has of the atom bomb being dropped during World War II and how he saved a Japanese soldier by the name of Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi) in the process. This is followed by memories of Jean Grey, telling him she's waiting for him in the afterlife. Yeah, you could say he's tormented.Living alone in the wilderness the first allusions to him living the life of a ronin are hinted at. He's also being watched in the shadows by a young red-headed girl we'll soon come to know as Yukio (Rila Fukushima), a girl with the power of seeing into the future only it seems to be a bit glitchy as it comes and goes at strange times. Yukio, however, is one of the film's early highlights. In fact the first 20 minutes or so are quite impressive.It turns out Yukio has been spying on Logan at the behest of her adoptive father (who apparently found her in the garbage?), the very man Logan saved during World War II. He's requested Logan's presence beside his death bed, which leads to a trip to Tokyo. Bedside chatter, ulterior motives, double-crossing and a caretaker whose motivations are a bit cloudy get into the mix.The first act ends as Yashida's grand-daughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) finds herself in a bit of trouble. Logan steps in and things are underway. Sort of. Truthfully, at this point the film stops doing much of anything for about an hour before the ultimate finale delivers a final 30 minutes of loud noises, yelling and ""will he get out alive?"" scenarios that we know the answer to before they begin.The final two-thirds of The Wolverine are akin to taking a nap. I understand Mangold wanted to play this as something of a samurai film and, of the ten cinematic influences he listed, the most obvious are the visual references to Yasujiro Ozu's Floating Weeds, but only in sporadic moments during the film's opening did I feel we were close to getting anything similar to a true samurai film. Slow and dull does not equal samurai, though I'm sure much of the comic crowd that will hail this film as some sort of achievement will say that of classics from Seven Samurai to Sword of Doom.Fact of the matter it's difficult to be two things at once, especially if those two things are a classic samurai film and a 2013 Summer Blockbuster and to read that Jackman believes this is the Wolverine film he's wanted to make ever since he first donned the claws is just sad because I do feel as if it's one of his best performances as the character.Even in the final two-thirds, while I was pinching myself in an effort to stay awake, Logan has several great lines, none better than ""I don't have time for this s***"" as Yukio struggles to get to the point. Well said, Logan, I felt the same way about 45 minutes earlier about this film.The villains of the piece are either conflicted ""Who is that guy?"" characters, nameless ninjas that apparently travel with a large number of arrows with ropes attached to them, children with daddy issues and the Viper character played by Svetlana Khodchenkova as some sort of cross between Charlize Theron and Abbie Cornish. There's a moment where Viper sheds her skin like a snake and if you can figure out why it was necessary I'd love to hear it because it seemed to me like one of those moments where a studio exec would say, ""Does she shed her skin? It would be so cool if she shed her skin. You gotta get her to shed her skin!"" Well, she did and it makes zero sense amid a finale where all I wanted it to do was stop.If there's anything to be thankful for with The Wolverine is that it's boring in a way much differently than the other summer blockbusters we've endured. It's simply a miscalculation of narrative tone and understanding of what they were dealing with. Mangold clearly isn't going for a mindless actioner, but instead a thoughtful story, but he lingers for so long on narrative elements that don't matter everything else is forogtten. It's also one of those films where the villain is 100% unnecessary. The villain is within Wolverine, why must he face an outward demon to deal with his inner demons?At one point a character refers to Logan as a masterless Ronin (a redundant statement, but okay), playing on the death of Professor X (Patrick Stewart) in X-Men 3, but this piece of the story is left to linger and waft in the wind. Instead of so many tedious moments with a ghostly Jean Grey, that are meant to explore Logan's struggles between an immortal life and a human death, but the metaphor is lost in repetition. The best influence this script could have hoped for was Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo and oh boy would that have been glorious.As if you needed any other sign the film is a dud, you could almost hear a collective sigh from the preview audience I watched this with, but most remained for the end credits scene that teases the next X-Men film. The scene runs about two minutes long and immediately after cheers, hoots, hollering and clapping erupted from the audience. They liked the two minute throwaway scene more than the movie itself! An excellent indicator when it comes to audience expectations with regard to today's big budget movies. As long as they are promised more they will forget what they just saw and clap and cheer while doing so. I dream of the day when we get a real X-Men film...you know the one that is an assemble piece not where the entire universe is centered around some guy in a wife beater.",1,"Please, for the love of God STOP MAKING WOLVERINE FILMS!!!

In my opinion, most books and almost every video game story/characters are not translated well into movies.  I could go on all day, but on to my thoughts for this movie.Forget what I just said above----The Wolverine doesn't apply.  Finally, a dramatic approach to a complex character without 30 kabillion different kinds of mutants, high dollar gratuitous special effects every second of the film, and an overblown quacky screenplay that just plain sucks.In the X-Men franchise (along with the previous Wolverine movie) we always see a polished, and hard to sell fantasy we all wish could be &#34;for real&#34; just for the 2 hours it takes to watch.  But, for me, any realism was never there.  That said, I'm a fan of the series nonetheless.  A diehard fan that goes back some 35 years to my days as a kid blowing his allowance on comic books.This latest installment shows a real departure from the previous X-Men movie formula, and brings the Wolverine character down to ground level along with the rest of us mere mortals.

1581937,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0090SI56Y,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","By now even non-Marvel comics devotees know the persona of The Wolverine, primarily because he has been recreated by actor Hugh Jackman six times (and if you pay attention to the film&#8217;s ending it seems there will be more&#8230;). Writers Mark Bomback and Scott Frank have elected to place the action of this version in Japan &#8211; both in the time of the Atomic Bombing of Nagasaki and the present. Much of the reason this version works well is due to the fact that the action is all in the beauty of Japan of today &#8211; not only the scenery but also the symbols and traditions. Director James Mangold gives this version of Wolverine adventure a hefty dose of compassion and human feeling and that adds significantly.According to the short synopsis form 20th Century Fox, &#8216;In modern day Japan, Wolverine is out of his depth in an unknown world as he faces his ultimate nemesis in a life-or-death battle that will leave him forever changed. Vulnerable for the first time and pushed to his physical and emotional limits, he confronts not only lethal samurai steel but also his inner struggle against his own immortality, emerging more powerful than we have ever seen him before.&#8217; That states it well. Add to that description the many fights and magic that occur before our eyes and the content is complete.Hugh Jackman is in buff form as a very tender Wolverine (Logan) this time around (flashbacks to his loss of his love, Famke Janssen, add spice). Others who make solid appearances include Tao Okamoto as the important Mariko, Rila Fukushima as Logan&#8217;s sidekick, Svetlana Khochenkova as the evil Viper, Hiroyuki Sanada as a credible Shingen, and Ken Yamamura and Haruhiko Yamanouchi sharing the role of Yashida.A bit on the long side, the film provides the expected visual entertainment, and this time there is a bit more humanity infused as well.

1581945,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0090SI56Y,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 1]","So I can't make up my mind about The Wolverine. Overall, it was a good time at the movies. But some things nagged me. One thing that's never nagged me is Hugh Jackman's performance as Wolverine. No matter the shine or the stank on the vehicle, Jackman is never less than fully engaged and committed. I don't even mind anymore that there's this 6' tall actor playing the 5'3"" Wolverine. But it's an indicator of something shady when the mid-credit stinger gets your juices flowing more than the film's big action finale.The first 75% of The Wolverine is terrific stuff. It features our snikting Canuck wallowing in an existential predicament. The film opens with a flashback to 1945 to a captive Logan held at a Japanese POW camp near Nagasaki. Shifting to present day, somewhere in the Yukon, we catch up with Logan circa post-X-Men: The Last Stand. This is a Logan who's gone hermit, who's given up, who's being haunted by recurring hallucinations and nightmares about Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) whom he had to put down to save the world.But enter Yukio (Rila Fukushima), a precognitive mutant and a ninja. Yukio convinces Logan to journey to Japan to visit his dying old friend Yashida to settle a decades-old debt. In Tokyo, Yashida charges Logan with safeguarding his daughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto). And the dead man had cause to fret. Couldn't even wait for the funeral to get done before the Yakuza burst out of the woodwork, targeting Mariko and the rest of Yashida's progeny. And there's Logan, healing ability mysteriously stripped, charging into the breach.To me, The Wolverine breaks down to a few highs, plenty of mediums, some lows. Gratifyingly, it's a character story and a self-contained story. It (mostly) isolates the world-weary Logan as a mutant in a human world and, in Japan, a stranger in a strange land. I said ""mostly isolates"" because he does share space with two other mutants, Yukio and, uh, the venomous ""Dr. Green"" (Svetlana Khodchenkova). Still, it's a refreshing swerve from the proliferation of mutants in X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine.What works? Hugh Jackman works, more than anything else in this production. Because of his newfound weakness, Wolverine is physically tested as never before. Add in the emotional extremes his character must navigate and this just may be Jackman's most accomplished turn yet as Wolverine. Water cooler talk suggests that Jackman approached the Rock for tips on how to bulk up, and I guess Dwayne did him a solid because Jackman looks absolutely ripped. 75% of the narrative works. I love the location shooting in Japan, a glistening metropolis that consistently provides visually arresting backdrops. Rila Fukushima as ""Yukio"" is really terrific; I think Rila strikes up better chemistry with Jackman than does Tao Okamoto. There wasn't as much action as expected but two sequences stand out: the sprawling funeral melee and the disagreement on the bullet train (never mind that the combatants dis the laws of physics). And, of course, the almighty mid-credit stinger.Also, I kinda love the Explorations of Mars love suite.That was the carrot, here comes the stick. I mentioned that the first 3/4 of the movie is terrific, character-developing stuff. The one thing within that frame that I couldn't entirely buy into is the underwhelming love story between Logan and Mariko. I'm not convinced. Not enough scenes play out where we see them falling in love. They just are, suddenly. Mariko is supposed to be Logan's emotional life life, and yet I'm more invested when Logan's interacting with Yukio.The final 25% sucks as the plot gives way to mindless CGI crap. The film required a villainous foil that could engage the viewer better. The Silver Samurai? Viper? Please. As it were, the big build-up meant nothing to me. So there's a slew of missed opportunities. The non-impactful big bads. The weak ending. The unconvincing romance. That extended sequence in which a horde of ninjas shoot arrow after arrow into a walking away Wolverine fails to deliver a payoff. I was waiting and waiting for Logan to turn around and administer berserk Wolverine justice... but nah.It's lovely to see Famke Janssen reprising her Jean Grey role... for the first, oh, two dream sequences. After that, I was done, yo.I could've sworn Logan spoke Japanese. But, probably, I'm getting my comic book mixed up with my movies.Finally, to maximize your viewing enjoyment, you should probably watch X-Men Origins: Wolverine first, after which awfulness The Wolverine will come off as the best thing ever.3.5 out of 5 snikts for The Wolverine.",4,angsty snikt,1397692800,"04 17, 2014",2014,4604,"['So', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'Wolverine',

The first 2 installments are both really good (X2 the best out of the pair), but they seem underwhelming to me in a way, being a fan that watched other superhero films first, ones that were more recent and had more of a fanbase. As any fan knows, X3 failed to impress in almost every respect, only delivering fully action-wise and with a certain after- credits scene. First Class is definitely the best of the bunch, even though it does get fairly juvenile at times with the younger mutants' story lines. Origins was a spin-off film that still didn't reveal anything new about the character, and was a convoluted mess because of it, despite some great action scenes. And they have all done their part to confuse fans with the continuity errors and plot holes. However, even after all this, they are still very well done. They have some of the best casts ever assembled, and boast top-shelf special effects. This particular film is an excellent example of that. Jackman returns to the role that made him famous among American audiences, sharing the screen with a mostly foreign cast that still manages to hold its own. It is an adaptation of the comics' Japan Saga, but holds several surprises due to some worthwhile liberties taken. Logan finds himself in a dark place after the events of X3. He is basically just a wanderer, much like he was before the events of X1. He is asked to return to Japan as part of a favor for a man whose life he saved during World War II. Once he gets there, nothing proves to be as it seems. The country holds many enemies and a few friends for him, and he might just not come out of it alive. I say that with absolute seriousness. Due to a certain critical plot point, Wolverine might just lose what makes him a mutant and not be able to get it back. And I won't even talk about who Wolverine has been seeing in some very weird visions, because that would just be wrong. There is action, suspense, and tragedy aplenty. Jackman gives a terrific performance, finally being able to deliver on what Origins fell far short of doing - really figuring out the Wolverine character, emotionally, mentally, and physically. The only problem I had with the film is that the story required a certain amount of filling stuff in for myself, and some stuff that I had to ask others about afterwards. I should also mention that as far as continuity with the other films, this one acts as its own entity. It sidesteps all the controversy - taking place sometime after X3 - but no more specific than that. It also weaves in one of the better plot points from X3 as part of the story, and is all the better because of it. Since it is totally Wolverine's story, the other X-Men don't physically appear. Therefore, no one needs worry about overlapping plots or anything like that. As long as one is able to overlook the very minor disadvantages of the film, they will agree that it is a  great film, a great superhero movie, along with great performances by Jackman and his foreign co-stars.",4,"Not as good as other superhero films of the year, but miles better than the first three X-Men films.",1377907200,"08 31, 2013",2013,3070,"['X-Men', 'films', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'kind', 'hit-or-miss', 'opinion', 'first', '2', 'installments', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'X2', 'best', 'pair', 'seem', 'underwhelming', 'way', 'being', 'fan', 'watched', 'other', 'superhero', 'films', 'first', 'ones', 'were', 'more', 'recent', 'had', 'more', 'fanbase', 'fan', 'X3', 'failed', 'impress', 'almost', 'respect', 'only', 'delivering', 'fully', 'action-wise', 'certain', 'after-', 'credits', 'scene', 'First', 'Class', 'definitely', 'best', 'bunch', 'even', 'get', 'fairly', 'juvenile', 'times', 'younger', 'mutants', 'story', 'lines', 'Origins', 'was', 'spin-off', 'film', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'anything', 'new', 'character', 'was', 'convoluted', 'mess', 'great', 'action', 'scenes', 'have', 'done', 'part', 'confuse', 'fans', 'continuity', 'errors', 'plot', 'holes', 'However', 'even', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'have', 'best', 'casts', 'ever', 'assembled', 'boast', 'top-shelf', 'special', 'effects', 'particular', 'film', 'excellent', 'example', 'Jackman', 'role', 'made', 'famous', 'American', 'audiences', 'sharing', 'screen', 'mostly', 'foreign', 'cast', 'still', 'hold', 'own', 'adaptation', 'comics', 'Japan', 'Saga', 'several', 'surprises', 'due', 'worthwhile', 'liberties', 'taken', 'Logan', 'dark', 'place', 'events', 'X3', 'basically', 'just', 'wanderer', 'much', 'was', 'events', 'X1', 'asked', 'return', 'Japan', 'part', 'favor', 'man', 'life', 'saved', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Once', 'there', 'nothing', 'proves', 'be', 'country', 'many', 'enemies', 'few', 'friends', 'might', 'just', 'not', 'come', 'alive', 'say', 'absolute', 'seriousness', 'Due', 'certain', 'critical', 'plot', 'point', 'Wolverine', 'might', 'just', 'lose', 'what', 'mutant', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'back', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'talk', 'who', 'Wolverine', 'been', 'seeing', 'very', 'weird', 'visions', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'wrong', 'action', 'suspense', 'tragedy', 'aplenty', 'Jackman', 'terrific', 'performance', 'finally', 'being', 'able', 'deliver', 'what', 'Origins', 'fell', 'far', 'short', 'doing', 'really', 'figuring', 'out', 'Wolverine', 'character', 'emotionally', 'mentally', 'physically', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'film', 'story', 'required', 'certain', 'amount', 'filling', 'stuff', 'myself', 'stuff', 'had', 'ask', 'others', 'afterwards', 'should', 'also', 'mention', 'as', 'far', 'continuity', 'other', 'films', 'one', 'own', 'entity', 'controversy', 'taking', 'place', 'sometime', 'X3', 'more', 'specific', 'also', 'one', 'better', 'plot', 'points', 'X3', 'part', 'story', 'better', 'totally', 'Wolverine', 'story', 'other', 'X-Men', 'do', ""n't"", 'physically', 'appear', 'Therefore', 'one', 'worry', 'overlapping', 'plots', 'anything', 'As', 'long', 'one', 'able', 'overlook', 'very', 'minor', 'disadvantages', 'film', 'will', 'agree', 'great', 'film', 'great', 'superhero', 'movie', 'great', 'performances', 'Jackman', 'foreign', 'co-stars']",N/A

1581961,A1LVHR5OO45L5V,B0090SI56Y,JAG 2.0,"[0, 1]","Once again, Hugh Jackman assumes the role of ""The Wolverine"" based on the X-Men series of comic books. In this installment of the popular series of movies, Logan (the name Wolverine goes by) is asked to travel to the deathbed of an old acquaintance in Japan. The man whose life Logan saved wishes to give him a message.The first 5-10 minutes of the film are wasted as Wolverine dispenses justice to the evil, white, rural, gun-toting, beer-swilling hunters who kill a grizzly bear (a friend of Logan, apparently) with - get this - a poisoned arrow! What nonsense! After the usual indoctrination by Hollywierd cultural-Marxists, the film moves on to the real story.From the moment he lands in Japan, Logan is caught up in a web of cross and double cross with a giant corporation as the prize...or, so we think. I don't do spoilers, so, I'll just say the storyline is very good, the plotline taut. Logan only discovers what the real game is and what the real stakes are at the very end. There aren't any slow spots in this film and I was surprised by the ending sequence.Early on in the movie, Logan loses his power of self-healing that has allowed him to take an amazing amount of harm and still come out on top in the past. He struggles throughout the film with this loss as well as the greater struggle he has faced for uncounted years by being, essentially, immortal. Visions of his past love - Jean Grey - speak to him in moments of delirium.I think the action sequences are excellent. The CGI is used with abandon, but it doesn't come off as over-the-top to this viewer. Instead, it makes him the ""superhero"" the Wolverine is. Since the film takes place in Japan, there are plenty of fights with Yakuza, Ninja and samurai of a sort. The difference is that, in this film, Logan is vulnerable to the knives, guns and swords he has sneered at in the past and we see him...weak.I thought the film, once it got going after the lefty-PC-rubbish, was quite good and this reviewer found it visually and substantively attractive.

1581962,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B0090SI56Y,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[11, 15]","Wolverine. He's the best he is at what he does, and what he does isn't very nice.That WAS true, until Hugh Jackman was cast to play him in Bryan Singer's original X-MEN from 2000. He's not the feral little furball people wanted, and oh, how the fanboys cried when they heard that he got his start in MUSICAL THEATRE!!! NOOOO!!! WHAT A PANSY WOLVERINE WILL BE!!And how quickly they were proven wrong. In the first X-MEN film, we see that Jackman understood quickly exactly who Wolverine was, and with X2: X-MEN UNITED, we knew that there was at least one scene that could show how Jackman could properly portray not only the eternal outsider, but showed us how a berserker rage would look like on the big screen. The abysmal failure on every possible level of X-MEN THE LAST STAND and the well-intentioned but still very sub-par X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE had dragged the powerful mutant franchise down. But after the success of X-MEN FIRST CLASS, Fox felt that it was time to give the audience what it was looking for: The definitive Wolverine story. And with director James Mangold (COPLAND, 3:10 TO YUMA) at the helm, and basing their story largely on what is considered by many to be THE best Wolverine story in comics form (1985's four-issue mini-series by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller), they were able to achieve something seemingly impossible. They made THE WOLVERINE, and this is the best film of the MANY superhero films that the summer of 2013 yielded.At its essence, THE WOLVERINE is a noirish romance thriller. Logan, haunted by having to kill his great love Jean Grey (Famke Janssen, who appears in dream sequences) at the end of X3, has become a recluse, living alone in the Canadian wilderness. He is found in the midst of an undesired bar brawl by Yukio (a dynamic performance by Rila Fukushima), a petite yet fierce warrior, to bring him to Japan at the behest of her adoptive grandfather Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi), a dying old man Logan saved back when the Americans bombed Hiroshima. Since then, Yashida has amassed a large fortune through his company, and offers Logan the one thing that he may truly want: mortality. It's something that Logan does not initially accept, but it is given nonetheless by Yashida's mysterious doctor, secretly the mutant Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova). It is then that Logan meets Mariko (Tao Okamoto), a beautiful young woman with an abusive and morally bankrupt husband. When Yashida dies, all hell breaks loose as the Yakuza and other criminal elements look to destroy the remainder of the Yashida clan. As Logan looks to defend those around him, he discovers all too quickly that his healing powers are no longer working properly. Logan and Mariko hide from the would-be assassins and they find love in the unlikeliest of places. But like all star-crossed lovers, they might have a very tragic ending if Logan, Yukio and Mariko can't get The Wolverine back.First off, there is very little wrong with the film, but the things that are wrong with it are pretty glaring, and that revolves mostly around the climactic battle with Logan vs. a mecha-ed version of the Silver Samurai. It has really very little emotional stakes, and while very nice to look at, it seems to come out of nowhere. The smaller action beats are the ones that are far more effective and not only showcase Mangold's command of space and character, but they actually serve the STORY AND THE CHARACTERS, which is something not often seen in this current era of action films. The film is smart enough to be different enough from the classic storyline to give some cool surprises, but adheres to it enough to give us a pretty awesome WOLVERINE film. Aside from Jackman, who gives easily his best performance as Logan here, the other real standout of the cast is Rila Fukushima, as the manga-influenced Yukio. She's adorable, funny, smart and utterly lethal. The rest of the cast does commendable work with maybe the exception of Khodchenkova, but that's less to do with her work, and more to do with the script kind of short-changing her character (although if that role had been played by Jessica Biel, who was originally cast in the role, I'm sure that would have been a much more substantial character) The film is also assisted by its Japanese setting. It takes us out of a world we've become overly familiar with in superhero films, which is also a great change of pace. Another problem I do have with this film, though, is its distinct lack of bloodletting. Wolverine is a noble yet violent character; killing is part of who he is, and his claws do about the same amount of damage as in any of his Saturday morning cartoon iterations. Although it's rumored that the extended cut of this film will have more violent content than this PG-13 rated version, I wouldn't think that it would make a whole lot of difference. It would be nice, though, if at some point in the not-too-distant future that they went for the kind of eviscerations that would make Quentin Tarantino jealous.When it's all said and done, though, thanks to a compelling story, terrific direction, a mostly smart script, and some terrific performances, THE WOLVERINE is the film that fans of the character deserved after the failure of X-MEN: THE LAST STAND and X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE... which, for some reason, is currently better rated on this site than this film.Snikt!",4,"While imperfect, THE WOLVERINE still stands atop the superhero films

Kuntz ""wakingupin528""","[6, 11]","In a year jam-packed with blockbusters and art-house thrillers, there are a great many movies that are purely amazing and awesome. Among them are three comic-to-film adaptations: 2 Marvel films and a DC Comic movie. One of these Marvel films is The Wolverine. Set after the events of X-Men The Last Stand, Wolverine/Logan is now away from everything and everyone, wandering the back-roads of the Yukon. But when a girl named Yukio finds Logan, she has him travel to Tokyo, Japan with her to meet with a man from Logan's past. But as Wolverine battles with losing his immortality, he also has to battle his inner demons, which threaten everything he knows.The Wolverine is easily one of the best Marvel films yet, having a good script, great directing, and superb acting from the even greater Hugh Jackman, who truly is Wolverine in this installment. What I found truly incredible, though, is how the action sequences didn't just help bring intensity to the movie, but were needed to help the story move along. Even better, the action sequences were not absolutely massive. Even the battle between Logan and the Silver Samurai (which was one of the most epic action scenes of all time), was not grand in size. James Mangold really knew what he was doing when he directed this, and if you have seen his film 3:10 to Yuma, you can get the feeling that he took some details from that and put them into this movie. The script, by Mark Bomback (the new Total Recall and Live Free or Die Hard) & Scott Frank, was not cheesy, over-the-top, or missing anything needed. The dialogue was great, very believable, and the characters were perfectly written; character development was all over the place! The musical score by Marco Beltrami is easily his best since 3:10 to Yuma, and the visual effects, while not award-winning (compared to other movies this year), are great, never out of place. The cinematography was stunning, with the shots of Nagasaki and Tokyo helping to place the audience and Wolverine in a totally different world.Overall, The Wolverine is the movie Wolverine fans have been wanting for a while now, especially after the mistake that was X-Men Origins. I just hope Jackman is as big in X-Men Days of Future Past as he was here, in both character and physique.4.5/5 Stars",5,A True Superhero Spectacle!,1375228800,"07 31, 2013",2013,2281,"['year', 'jam-packed', 'blockbusters', 'art-house', 'thrillers', 'are', 'great', 'many', 'movies', 'are', 'purely', 'amazing', 'awesome', 'are', 'three', 'comic-to-film', 'adaptations', '2', 'Marvel', 'films', 'DC', 'Comic', 'movie', 'One', 'Marvel', 'films', 'Wolverine', 'Set', 'events', 'X-Men', 'Last', 'Stand', 'Wolverine/Logan', 'now', 'away', 'everything', 'everyone', 'wandering', 'back-roads', 'Yukon', 'when', 'girl', 'named', 'Yukio', 'Logan', 'travel', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'meet', 'man', 'Logan', 'past', 'Wolverine', 'losing', 'immortality', 'also', 'battle', 'inner', 'demons', 'threaten', 'everything', 'Wolverine', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'Marvel', 'films', 'yet', 'having', 'good', 'script', 'great', 'directing', 'superb', 'acting', 'even', 'greater', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'who', 'truly', 'Wolverine', 'installment', 'What', 'found', 'truly', 'incredible', 'though', 'how', 'action', 'sequences', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'help', 'bring', 'intensity', 'movie', 'were', 'needed', 'help', 'story', 'move', 'Even', 'better', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'not', 'absolutely', 'massive', 'Even', 'battle', 'Logan', 'Silver', 'Samurai', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'epic', 'action', 'scenes', 'time', 'was', 'not', 'grand', 'size', 'James', 'Mangold', 'really', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'when', 'directed', 'have', 'seen', 'film', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'can', 'get', 'feeling', 'took', 'details', 'put', 'movie', 'script', 'Mark', 'Bomback', 'new', 'Total', 'Recall', 'Live', 'Free', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Scott', 'Frank', 'was', 'not', 'cheesy', 'over-the-top', 'missing', 'anything', 'needed', 'dialogue', 'was', 'great', 'very', 'believable', 'characters', 'were', 'perfectly', 'written', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'place', 'musical', 'score', 'Marco', 'Beltrami', 'easily', 'best', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'visual', 'effects', 'not', 'award-winning', 'compared', 'other', 'movies', 'year', 'are', 'great', 'never', 'place', 'cinematography', 'was', 'stunning', 'shots', 'Nagasaki', 'Tokyo', 'helping', 'place', 'audience', 'Wolverine', 'totally', 'different', 'world.Overall', 'Wolverine', 'movie', 'Wolverine', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'wanting', 'while', 'now', 'especially', 'mistake', 'was', 'X-Men', 'Origins', 'just', 'hope', 'Jackman', 'as', 'big', 'X-Men', 'Days', 'Future', 'Past', 'was', 'here', 'character', 'physique.4.5/5', 'Stars']",N/A

Kleeberg""","[5, 10]","The X-Men movies have been a roller coaster for fans of the source material.  2000's X-Men was a delight to see on the big screen, seeing our favorite band of heroes actually come together on screen for the first time.  X-Men 2 topped that, becoming one of the finest comic related movies still to this day.  Unfortunately, that's when X-Men: Last Stand came out.Helmed by a new director (Brett Ratner, infamous in Hollywood for his mediocrity), Last Stand basically flushed the X-Men legacy down the toilet.  Armed with memes and the audacity to murder off prominent members of the X-Men lineup, the X-Men movies came to a halt.In '09, Wolverine had his first solo outing, X-Men Origins: Wolverine.  It was, in a word, terrible.After seeing those two duds, I was not excited for X-Men: First Class, but went to see it anyway.  It was surprisingly good, and brought life back to the X-crew.  Finally, the series had a pulse.  Now, in 2013, in anticipation of X-Men: Days of Future Past, comes The Wolverine.First, the cast.  Hugh Jackman has never looked better as Logan.  He worked hard to get in shape for this role (even employing help from The Rock), and it really showed.  The rest of the supporting cast is sufficient, but does not stand out.The direction was sufficient by James Mangold.  I can only dream about what may have been with Darren Arronofsky at the helm.  He had worked on the film and script for 6 months, but wanted a much darker, rated R film, which the studio did not want.  Shame.  Could have been amazing, and much closer to the comics.Overall, I liked this movie, but I liked it to the point that I probably wouldn't watch it again.  There was one scene that really stood out as being amazing - a fight along a bullet train that happens near the beginning of the story.  It was simply breathtaking, and one of those scenes that will stand out for years to come.  It's a shame it wasn't topped later on in the movie.I think that the problem with The Wolverine is that there was no great villain.  The villains in the film, including one female mutant, are very one-dimensional and very, very uninteresting.  From the trailers, you can see that we get the Silver Samurai, although he's nothing like he is in the comics.  I hope that the next Wolverine outing comes with a dose of Omega Red, as I think a one on one Omega/Wolverine movie would be outstanding.  If you look at the great comic book movies, they all have iconic, menacing, charismatic villains.  The Dark Knight had Joker, the king of villains.  Spider-Man 2 had Doc Oc.  The Dark Knight Rises had Bane.  This movie...had a few unmemorable villains.  Shame, really.There were a few good scenes here and Jackman did a great job as Logan/Wolverine, but as an overall product, I didn't think it was great.  It was better than Origins, however.PS: Be sure to stay after the credits, as (if you watched and remember the abomination known as X-Men: The Last Stand), there's quite a shocker that leads us into 2014's X-Men: Days of Future Past.Final Score: 3/5",3,Couldn't be worse than X-Men Origins: Wolverine...right?,1375315200,"08 1, 2013",2013,3040,"['X-Men', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'roller', 'coaster', 'fans', 'source', 'material', '2000', 'X-Men', 'was', 'delight', 'see', 'big', 'screen', 'seeing', 'favorite', 'band', 'heroes', 'actually', 'come', 'together', 'screen', 'first', 'time', 'X-Men', '2', 'topped', 'becoming', 'one', 'finest', 'comic', 'related', 'movies', 'still', 'day', 'Unfortunately', 'when', 'X-Men', 'Last', 'Stand', 'came', 'out.Helmed', 'new', 'director', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'infamous', 'Hollywood', 'mediocrity', 'Last', 'Stand', 'basically', 'flushed', 'X-Men', 'legacy', 'toilet', 'Armed', 'memes', 'audacity', 'murder', 'off', 'prominent', 'members', 'X-Men', 'lineup', 'X-Men', 'movies', 'came', 'halt.In', ""'09"", 'Wolverine', 'had', 'first', 'solo', 'outing', 'X-Men', 'Origins', 'Wolverine', 'was', 'word', 'terrible.After', 'seeing', 'two', 'duds', 'was', 'not', 'excited', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'went', 'see', 'anyway', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'brought', 'life', 'back', 'X-crew', 'Finally', 'series', 'had', 'pulse', 'Now', '2013', 'anticipation', 'X-Men', 'Days', 'Future', 'Past', 'Wolverine.First', 'cast', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'never', 'looked', 'better', 'Logan', 'worked', 'hard', 'get', 'shape', 'role', 'even', 'employing', 'help', 'Rock', 'really', 'showed', 'rest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'sufficient', 'not', 'stand', 'out.The', 'direction', 'was', 'sufficient', 'James', 'Mangold', 'can', 'only', 'dream', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Darren', 'Arronofsky', 'helm', 'had', 'worked', 'film', 'script', '6', 'months', 'wanted', 'much', 'darker', 'rated', 'R', 'film', 'studio', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'Shame', 'Could', 'have', 'been', 'amazing', 'much', 'closer', 'comics.Overall', 'liked', 'movie', 'liked', 'point', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'watch', 'again', 'was', 'one', 'scene', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'being', 'amazing', 'fight', 'bullet', 'train', 'beginning', 'story', 'was', 'simply', 'breathtaking', 'one', 'scenes', 'will', 'stand', 'out', 'years', 'come', 'shame', 'was', ""n't"", 'topped', 'later', 'movie.I', 'think', 'problem', 'Wolverine', 'was', 'great', 'villain', 'villains', 'film', 'including', 'one', 'female', 'mutant', 'are', 'very', 'one-dimensional', 'very', 'very', 'uninteresting', 'trailers', 'can', 'see', 'get', 'Silver', 'Samurai', 'nothing', 'comics', 'hope', 'next', 'Wolverine', 'outing', 'dose', 'Omega', 'Red', 'think', 'one', 'one', 'Omega/Wolverine', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'outstanding', 'look', 'great', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'have', 'iconic', 'menacing', 'charismatic', 'villains', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'had', 'Joker', 'king', 'villains', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'had', 'Doc', 'Oc', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'had', 'Bane', 'movie', 'had', 'few', 'unmemorable', 'villains', 'Shame', 'were', 'few', 'good', 'scenes', 'here', 'Jackman', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Logan/Wolverine', 'overall', 'product', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'better', 'Origins', 'however.PS', 'Be', 'sure', 'stay', 'credits', 'watched', 'remember', 'abomination', 'known', 'X-Men', 'Last', 'Stand', 'quite', 'shocker', '2014', 'X-Men', 'Days', 'Future', 'Past.Final', 'Score', '3/5']",N/A

Our hero was near Nagasaki when the A-Bomb was dropped and he saved a Japanese soldier at the time. Many decades later, with the death of his beloved Jean still haunting his dreams, he is summoned to Japan as that same man, now elderly, lays dying.My favorite part of ""Iron Man 3"" was when our guy was suddenly stripped of his power. In this one, we see another Marvel superhero become a mere mortal...at least for a time. Wolverine tries to help a young woman who is being pursued by gangsters and killers who are somehow tied to the death of her grandfather. In addition, he also finds himself in dire need of assistance from a young Goth chauffeur/bodyguard.Let's see who's who in this one:* Hugh Jackman (""Real Steel"" and ""Les Mis&eacute;rables"") is, for the sixth time, Logan/Wolverine, our self-repairing immortal who has retreated to the wilderness to grieve for his lost love.* Famke Janssen (""Taken"" and ""X-Men"") joins us courtesy of flashbacks and dreams, as Jean Grey, the woman he adored...and killed...* Rila Fukushima (""Karma: A Very Twisted Love Story"") is Yukio, Wolverine's maroon-haired bodyguard.* Tao Okamoto (in her first film) is Mariko, granddaughter of the elderly industrialist who offers to ""cure"" Logan of his immortality.There are many, many more characters in this story, but I have named the ones who caught MY eye. Of course we can expect endless fisticuffs and martial arts, along with CGI-driven action, but the fight on the speeding train is worthy of mention, as is our lonely hero's anger and isolation. This is a PG-13 film, so they are allowed one ""F"" word...which is used appropriately. I DID object to one scene where our hero has more arrows piercing his body than St. Sebastian!

With that said, I liked it quite a bit, and it's a vast improvement over X-Men Origins: Wolverine. The first two thirds of the movie were very good and grounded the movie in a more dark and realistic world, a nice departure from previous forays into the X-Men universe. The last act was kind of curve ball that embraced more generic superhero movies and was what really hurt the film. The director and star, Mangold and Jackman, cite Claremont and Miller's Japanese sage as inspiration for the film and it definitely is, but if they stuck closer to it and avoided over the top villains and comic book cliches, they could have made a real special movie. Instead, they've created a solid action movie that will satisfy most fans, but not knock their socks off.

And Wolverine is one of my favorite characters!I won't give too many details of the film, because other reviewers have that covered. My group was excited to see this film in theatre but after it was over, we all just sat there, and were quite frankly, a little disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it was a great movie! But it fell short in comparison to the first three, which were pretty epic. BUT, if you are not comparing them to the first three, it is a fun watch. I'll be honest, I did enjoy it the most out of my group, but even I had that feeling that something was missing. Hugh Jackman was great as always. But as we spent some time in Asia and looked into his past during a war, I felt like I was having a history lesson for a moment instead of watching an X-men movie. I think part of that is because, there were lots of ninjas and not enough X-men characters to make it feel like I was in that X-MEN fantasy world that I enjoy. Also there seemed to be multiple plots with anticlimactic ends for some. First this guy was the bad guy. Ope. But he's gone now. So wait, now I need to focus on this other plot.

1581995,AVWU1O6TH3SXG,B0090SI56Y,"J. McGinn ""HUNTSMAN""","[1, 3]","Is 2013's The Wolverine the Wolverine film fans had hoped for, but didn't get in 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine? The answer to that question is a resounding yes. With the success of X-Men: First Class and Fox's desire to create their own comic book film universe like Marvel and Disney are doing Fox smartly made smarter choices with The Wolverine. Fox wisely decided to chose a better director in the flawed, but solid director James Mangold as well smartly basing the films storyline off of the acclaimed writers Frank Miller and Chris Claremont's Wolverine mini-series, and what we get is a flawed and methodically paced film that is fun, exciting, and the second best comic book film of the year.The Wolverine is based off of Chris Claremont and Frank Miller's four issue limited Wolverine series, and one of Wolverine's better storyline revolving around Mariko Yashida (Tao Okamoto) who perhaps Logan's greatest love of his life. Being the fan of the character and storyline this is the storyline I had wanted for a Wolverine besides Logan's origins, and the writers delivered. The film opens up sometime after the ending of X-Men: The Last Stand. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) has been killed by Logan's own hands, and now Logan (Hugh Jackman) lives as a hermit in the mountains content to live a solitary life with his friendly grizzly bear neighbor, and his dreams of Jean. Logan should have known he isn't destined to live of hermit, and his found by Yukio (Rila Fukushima) in a small mountain Canadian town, where she tells him Ichir&#333; Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi) the man he saved back in World War II from a nuclear blast is now dying and wishes to see Logan. In Japan, Yashida offers Logan want he has come to secretly desire in a way to die. There he meets Mariko, Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova), Shingen Yashida (Hiroyuki Sanada) and others as Logan is betrayed and reluctantly gets involved in a family feud.While I did enjoy the storyline of The Wolverine I think I need to talk about my problems with the plot. First is the character Kenuichio Harada who is perhaps my biggest issue with the plot. Anyone who has read the comics knows that Harada is the Silver Samurai as well as a mutant, and because of the choice by Fox, Mangold, and the writers not make Harada the Silver Samurai it just makes the character seem out of place in the film, and that Harada didn't really belong in the film at all. All my other issues with The Wolverine's plot are small ones like the lack of screen time for Viper. Instead of focusing on the now pointless Harada Mangold should had focused more on Viper. The other flaw was the dream sequences between Logan and Jean Grey. While I understand why they were added I just thought there were too many of them, and the only one that truly stood out was the final scene between Logan and Jean, which I thought was exceptional. Still even with the flaws in the plot the good outweighed the bad. I loved the chemistry between Logan and Yukio. Yukio is Logan's comrade and friend in the comics, and I feel the writers did do the character justice with her sense of humor and martial arts skills, but more importantly I loved the chemistry between Logan and Mariko. Mariko was well written, and very similar to the comics as are her feeling for Logan. Logan is a haunted man by both the things he has done and the people he has lost, so I loved how the writers showed Logan's haunted side. I'm sure it is not easy being a man who will basically live forever never aging or dying while all the people he loves and cares about are killed or whither and die, and the writers along with Mangold and Jackman do a wonderful job displaying that for the audience to see.Not all fans were happy with the choice of Hugh Jackman back in the first X-Men film. Fans didn't like the appearance of Jackman. He didn't have the same build and was too tall the critics cried, but I didn't a problem with the changes made to Logan's appearance as long as it was done well, and over five films plus a cameo appearance I think Jackman has proved his critics wrong. Jackman has done a splendid job embodying the character of Logan whether it being his ruthless side or emotional side to the characters mannerisms and style of speech, Jackman has done an excellent job portraying the character as he does here in The Wolverine. Besides Jackman doing another great job as Logan the Japanese cast did a splendid job in their roles as well. Hiroyuki Sanada who also gave wonderful performances in Sunshine and The Last Samurai gives another good performance as Shingen Yashida the son of Ichir&#333; Yashida, and father to Mariko who lets his ambition and desire for power get the better of him. Both Yukio and Mariko are portrayed by young and basically first time actresses, and you wouldn't know it unless you looked it up. Rila Fukushima personality and appearance fit the role of Yukio perfectly, while the beautiful Japanese model turned actress Tao Okamoto did a truly exceptional job with her performance with Mariko. Okamoto perfectly embodied the beautiful and strong willed Mariko as well as her love for Logan. The chemistry between Okamoto and Jackman was excellent throughout the film and especially at the love hotel, which was sweet and funny, and their time together at the home near Nagasaki, Japan, which was heartfelt and emotional. I hope to see both actresses more in the future. Just like Fukushima and Okamoto, Svetlana Khodchenkova is a relative unknown, and besides not having enough screen time Khodchenkova did a good job portraying the villain Viper.James Mangold is a quality director and writers has he has shown in the likes of 3:10 to Yuma, Walk the Line and Cop Land and continues to do a good job directing here in The Wolverine except for the action sequences. Maybe it is the editing of the film to get a better runtime and a pg-13 rating or maybe it is because Mangold didn't know how to direct a comic book film styled action sequence, but with the exception of an outstanding action sequence on a bullet train none of the action sequences truly stand out. It's not that they are bad, because they weren't bad. The action sequences were entertaining; it's just that the majority of the action sequences just weren't riveting or memorable.Fox has definitely gotten what it wanted here with The Wolverine. The film is flawed, but has good character writing and dramatic scenes as well as good direction by Mangold and decent action, and more importantly for Fox, The Wolverine expands Fox's X-Men universe has well as teasing us with the upcoming X-Men: Days of Futures Past. Yes there is a mid-credit scene and it was great. The scene between the three characters is a good lead into next year's X-Men film. The Wolverine is the film fan boys have wanted that will both satisfy fans of the comic and character as well as the ordinary viewer. One will love seeing one of Wolverine's best story lines come to life while the other will just enjoy the fun and entertaining film.",4,Eternity can be a curse... a man can run out of things to live

1581996,A1OYNQNK3ZM5QB,B0090SI56Y,J. Meeley,"[0, 0]","After the lackluster feelings people had to &#34;X-Men Origins: Wolverine,&#34; you'd think it wouldn't be tough to outdo it in being an entertaining effort. And this film does manage to do that, but not enough to be considered a great film experience.Picking up where &#34;X-Men: The Last Stand&#34; left off, Wolverine is now living like a mountain man and battling his own guilt. But he is soon drawn into a web of conflict and honor in Japan, due to an old acquaintance, which has him facing not only his guilt and past, but his own sense of mortality.Much of this story's main thrust and inspiration is taken from the early 80's mini-series by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller. Director James Mangold does a decent enough job of implementing the facets of that story, while updating it for more modern sensibilities. He also does some wonderful work with some of the major action sequences, as well. But many of the performances just feel subdued, save for Jackman's as Wolverine. The emotional context of the scenes and motivations don't quite ring true. The love affair with Wolverine and Mariko (played by Tao Okamoto) Feels extremely rushed and forced. And the inclusion of Viper (played by Svetlana Khodchenkova) feels completely miscast and unnecessary. However, the last bit at the end during the credits, was a great bit of tease, which was a lot of fun and one of the best moments of the film.Hugh Jackman does his best to give you what you expect from the character he's spent over a decade bringing to life on the big screen. He perfectly provides you with a very realistic feeling for the inner turmoil within Wolverine's soul. But there are many lost opportunities to dig deeper into it, which are sidetracked for the action sequences and other characters machinations that aren't vital to the story and don't really advance the overall plot very much. There was so much more that could have been expanded upon with Wolverine and Mariko, if the time used on these superfluous character plots had not been in the way. Worst of all is that Yukio's character (played by Rila Fukushima) was totally wasted as little more than a plot exposition guru, there to fill in the blanks that the script and story didn't bear out as they should. Although, her battle in the medical lab with Shingen (played by Hiroyuki Sanada) was one of the better action scenes of the film, which I enjoyed very much.In the final analysis, &#34;The Wolverine&#34; ends up as just a typical comic book movie. Not horrible, but not particularly great, either. I liked it, but then I'm also a big comic fan, too. As I said before, it is a better effort than the last Wolverine related film, but that falls under the heading of &#34;damning with faint praise.&#34; Those who are fans of the character and his comic adventures will likely get some decent enjoyment from this, as will those looking for a semi-interesting action film.

DVDs would still give the standard-def version as the digital copy, but that makes sense at least -- a low-def original and low-def digital copy. I'd also always get the same version of the movie that I had on disc.But not Fox and &#34;The Wolverine Unleashed Extended Edition&#34;. Nope, they're only giving you the PG-13 version for the digital copy, even though iTunes has the unleashed version available. And even more stupid is that if you get the digital copy through iTunes, it's standard definition instead of HD. If you want an HD copy, Fox is forcing you to use Google Play or another service that supports UltraViolet, even though every other Blu-Ray I've bought that has a UV redemption page has never failed to take me to iTunes and still give me the HD copy for the download.Why am on a tare about this? Because I buy the physical copy as a backup, and use the digital copy for primary (streaming) playback on my AppleTV or my iPad (depending on where I am). I don't have a Blu-Ray player for my Mac and I'm not about to go and buy one just to rip in one movie. Why the heck should I? What I buy is what I expect to get, for all advertised components.Yes, this 4-disc set also comes with a copy of the PG-13 version, so in the strictest sense they're not doing something wrong.

1582005,A1H1C2UZ6FH0YL,B0090SI56Y,Johnfourtytwo,"[4, 10]","Not a terribly bad movie but it is slow from beginning to end where it picks up a bit but left me wondering what the writers, producers, and director had in mind because I was lost from beginning to end.I never read the comics as a kid so I don't know the detailed story that most of you have with Marvel Universe so please bear with me if you think I'm being too critical of this movie.It starts out borrowing the storyline from the '70s TV show Grizzley Adams which I enjoyed; since I really enjoyed that TV show as a kid from what I can remember of it, just wondering if the bear in this movie was named Ben like the one in the TV show.As for the atom bomb scene, I can believe Wolverine would survive the blast (under Marvel Universe rules) but the Japanese soldier he sheltered from the blast would have been cooked to a crisp since he had no Mutant super powers, no doubt.  I know it's science fiction, but keep it believable from the real-life aspects that apply, that way you're not insulting the intelligence of the audience for the sake of entertainment value.  It reminded me of the ridiculous scene from the beginning of the last Indiana Jones movie where he survives a nuclear blast from ground zero by hiding in a lead-lined refrigerator.  The lead may have sheltered him from the radiation but the heat from the blast would have cooked him to a crisp and the crash landing would have totally destroyed his burnt corpse to pieces since he had no restraints inside that frig to keep his body from being violently tossed around.The rest of the Japanese storyline reminded me of various other borrowed movie storylines like Kill Bill, The Hunted, Shogun, and Karate Kid but nowhere near as entertaining because like I first mentioned this is a very slow movie.The fight scene at the end really annoyed me when it comes to believability because when the old Japanese guy superheats his adamantium sword to cut off Wolverine's claws made no sense because when you superheat metal it loses it's strength properties and becomes soft/pliable.  So that scene should have had him trying to cut off Wolverine's claws but cutting his sword in half or pieces instead since Wolverine's claws would be stronger than the sword.I think the writers got the sword-making process confused because you do have to superheat the sword to glowing red and quickly cool it by dousing it in water to temper it; it's part of the carbon steel-making process which traps/packs the carbon atoms tighter than just letting it cool normally (which would make a weak brittle knife/sword) and it's how all tempered knives are made.  The History Channel has an excellent documentary on Japanese Samuri Sword Making and manufacturing knives and other bladed tools which is what I'm using as a reference and the movie The Hunted does an excellent job at presenting the process from an entertaining/dramatic drunken swordmaker's point of view.  I know adamantium is not steel (it's actually a ficticous metal alloy created by Marvel Universe) but it is metal nonetheless and has to share the same basic metalurgic properties as all other metals whether real or fictitious.I know the purists are going to attack this post but please remember I never read the comics or any book adaptations of this series so I don't know what Marvel Universe's view on physics both real and theoretical is.  I do know that from a general science fiction point of view you have to bend some of it but to make it belieable you have to keep it grounded to the extent that it's not ridiculous which is what most early science fiction TV shows and movies did, but what I've seen from most of the other X-Men movie material, they didn't take it too far to be completely unbelievable or insulting the intelligence of the viewers.Unfortunately I didn't catch the Easter Egg and the end of the movie so I'll wait 'till it's out on Blu-ray and hopefully if a sequel is made they ratchet up the pace a bit because I almost fell asleep during this movie.",3,Fox Needs A Compass,1375488000,"08 3, 2013",2013,3998,"['Not', 'terribly', 'bad', 'movie', 'slow', 'beginning', 'end', 'where', 'up', 'bit', 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'writers', 'producers', 'director', 'had', 'mind', 'was', 'lost', 'beginning', 'end.I', 'never', 'read', 'comics', 'kid', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'detailed', 'story', 'most', 'have', 'Marvel', 'Universe', 'please', 'bear', 'think', ""'m"", 'being', 'too', 'critical', 'movie.It', 'out', 'borrowing', 'storyline', ""'70s"", 'TV', 'show', 'Grizzley', 'Adams', 'enjoyed', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'TV', 'show', 'kid', 'what', 'can', 'remember', 'just', 'wondering', 'bear', 'movie', 'was', 'named', 'Ben', 'one', 'TV', 'show.As', 'atom', 'bomb', 'scene', 'can', 'believe', 'Wolverine', 'would', 'survive', 'blast', 'Marvel', 'Universe', 'rules', 'Japanese', 'soldier', 'sheltered', 'blast', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'cooked', 'crisp', 'had', 'Mutant', 'super', 'powers', 'doubt', 'know', 'science', 'fiction', 'keep', 'believable', 'real-life', 'aspects', 'apply', 'way', ""'re"", 'not', 'insulting', 'intelligence', 'audience', 'sake', 'entertainment', 'value', 'reminded', 'ridiculous', 'scene', 'beginning', 'last', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'movie', 'where', 'nuclear', 'blast', 'ground', 'zero', 'hiding', 'lead-lined', 'refrigerator', 'lead', 'may', 'have', 'sheltered', 'radiation', 'heat', 'blast', 'would', 'have', 'cooked', 'crisp', 'crash', 'landing', 'would', 'have', 'totally', 'destroyed', 'burnt', 'corpse', 'pieces', 'had', 'restraints', 'frig', 'keep', 'body', 'being', 'violently', 'tossed', 'around.The', 'rest', 'Japanese', 'storyline', 'reminded', 'various', 'other', 'borrowed', 'movie', 'storylines', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'Hunted', 'Shogun', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'nowhere', 'entertaining', 'first', 'mentioned', 'very', 'slow', 'movie.The', 'fight', 'scene', 'end', 'really', 'annoyed', 'when', 'believability', 'when', 'old', 'Japanese', 'guy', 'adamantium', 'sword', 'cut', 'off', 'Wolverine', 'claws', 'made', 'sense', 'when', 'superheat', 'metal', 'strength', 'properties', 'soft/pliable', 'scene', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'trying', 'cut', 'off', 'Wolverine', 'claws', 'cutting', 'sword', 'half', 'pieces', 'instead', 'Wolverine', 'claws', 'would', 'be', 'stronger', 'sword.I', 'think', 'writers', 'got', 'sword-making', 'process', 'confused', 'do', 'have', 'superheat', 'sword', 'glowing', 'red', 'quickly', 'cool', 'dousing', 'water', 'temper', 'part', 'carbon', 'steel-making', 'process', 'carbon', 'tighter', 'just', 'letting', 'cool', 'normally', 'would', 'make', 'weak', 'brittle', 'knife/sword', 'how', 'tempered', 'knives', 'are', 'made', 'History', 'Channel', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'Japanese', 'Samuri', 'Sword', 'Making', 'manufacturing', 'knives', 'other', 'bladed', 'tools', 'what', ""'m"", 'using', 'reference', 'movie', 'Hunted', 'excellent', 'job', 'presenting', 'process', 'entertaining/dramatic', 'drunken', 'swordmaker', 'point', 'view', 'know', 'adamantium', 'not', 'steel', 'actually', 'ficticous', 'metal', 'alloy', 'created', 'Marvel', 'Universe', 'metal', 'nonetheless', 'share', 'same', 'basic', 'metalurgic', 'properties', 'other', 'metals', 'real', 'fictitious.I', 'know', 'purists', 'are', 'going', 'attack', 'post', 'please', 'remember', 'never', 'read', 'comics', 'book', 'adaptations', 'series', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Marvel', 'Universe', 'view', 'physics', 'real', 'theoretical', 'do', 'know', 'general', 'science', 'fiction', 'point', 'view', 'have', 'bend', 'make', 'belieable', 'have', 'keep', 'grounded', 'extent', 'not', 'ridiculous', 'what', 'most', 'early', 'science', 'fiction', 'TV', 'shows', 'movies', 'did', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'other', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'material', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'far', 'be', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'insulting', 'intelligence', 'viewers.Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'Easter', 'Egg', 'end', 'movie', 'so', ""'ll"", 'wait', ""'till"", 'out', 'Blu-ray', 'hopefully', 'sequel', 'made', 'ratchet', 'up', 'pace', 'bit', 'almost', 'fell', 'asleep', 'movie']",N/A

1582010,A3F9VH8916IA40,B0090SI56Y,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[1, 4]","The X Men have had a bit of a troubled road these last few years. Following the great success of X Men 2 they followed it up with the equally disastrous X Men 3. Just about everyone hated that film, but that hatred was nothing compared to how people reacted to X Men Origins: Wolverine. And though people tend to like X Men First Class, I thought it was a bore. Better then X3 and Origins, but nothing when compared to the first two movies. To my mind they haven't made a good X movie since X2 even after three tries. Wolverine especially seemed like a tired character, having appeared in all but one X film and making a cameo in the one he didn't star in.Set a few years after the events of the third movie we find Wolverine alone in the Canadian wilderness living the life of a hobo. His hair is long and matty, his beard shaggy and filled with twigs, and his cloths look like they haven't been washed in weeks. He also has a thing about standing out in the rain, which oddly enough happens quite a lot. It rains more in this film then an average day in the UK. Anyway, he is summoned to Japan to say his goodbyes to a man whose life he saved during the bombing of Nagasaki. Along the way he falls in love with some random Japanese woman, loses his ability to heal,  and gets into fights with ninjas.The Wolverine is a film that somehow manages to make a lot of mistakes but falls short of making an error that would put it in X Men: Origins territory. First off the love story seems very forced and out of place. It comes out of nowhere and then just ends as if it never happened. It's as if the producers decided they needed some sex thrown into the film in order for it to sell and decided to force it in there regardless of if it fits or not. Likewise the main villain, Venom, is wasted on this film. She doesn't do anything, or contribute in any meaningful way to the plot until the very end of the film. She pops in every now and then to remind us she's evil, but she hardly holds the same menacing presence as Magnito or other famous X Men villains. She's mostly there, it seems, so that Wolverine has a fellow mutant to fight instead of just measly humans but they don't fight the entire film. So what exactly was the point of her being there? Why waste such an interesting villain on a film where she has no role to play when you have Days of Futures Past coming in the future?But despite these glaring problems The Wolverine never bored me, or disinterested me enough to start nit picking at every little detail. Despite the alarming lack of mutant on mutant fighting Wolverine gets a good dose of fun and exciting action despite his powers being gimped for half the film. It was fun watching a venerable Wolverine taking on hordes of ninjas even though he should have been killed many times over had his powers really been taken away. My favorite scene was when he was fighting on top of a bullet train and needs to use his cunning to defeat his enemies instead of just brawling them to death like he likes to do.The Wolverine is ten times better than the dreck that we've seen from X Men lately but still manages to fall short of the first two films.

Both characters had a disappointing solo outing a few years ago (X-Men Origins: Wolverine and Superman Returns) followed by a much better, though not great, film this past year. Superman's reboot left him a bit unsure of himself as a moral hero (not his usual Boy Scout self); Wolverine's new film drains out his healing factor (not his usual immortal self).Wolverine's movie starts with his memories of World War II, specifically when he was in a prison camp just outside Nagasaki before the atomic bomb was dropped. He saved one of the Japanese soldiers who eventually became a highly successful businessman. In the modern day, the businessman sends one of his workers with a gift for Wolverine and a request to come say goodbye to his dying friend. The businessman can afford the best of care but he's an old man and doesn't have much longer to live. Unless, of course, he could get healing powers like Wolverine's...The plot moves on from there in fairly predictable but not unenjoyable fashion. Almost every Japanese stereotype is in the film (seppuku, yakuza, bullet trains, martial arts, samurais, family honor, ninjas, etc. etc.--except I didn't see any sushi or Godzilla*). Logan's loss of healing is a little bit inconsistent but is a good way to make him vulnerable. Hugh Jackman gives a good performance as a tortured soul dealing with a tortured body.

I was uber excited when I found out that the classic Wolverine in Japan story line would be the basis for this film. And surprisingly enough, after the barely tolerable mess that 2009's X Men Origins Wolverine was, this movie goes to show that improvements can always be made.Hugh Jackman returns yet again as Wolverine in what seems like his 100th time, but is ultimately his 7th time. And I gotta say, he put on quite the performance this time around. When I say he played the part to perfection in this movie, I MEAN IT. He brings the necessary brutality, the depression, the aggression, and overall force to the character. Famke Janseen makes minor appearances as Jean Grey. We also have a whole new cast of people some of you may or may not have heard of. Tao Okamoto portrays Mariko, Brian Tee plays Noburo, Rila Fukushima portrays  Yukio, and we also have a Russian actress by the name of Svetlana Khodchenkova who plays one of the movie's antagonists, Viper. The cast was excellent.Story wise, if you have read the full Japanese comic story involving Wolverine, then you know exactly what you are in for. And as a movie, The Wolverine brings the action, the unexpected and enjoyable humor, and the dramatic tone needed for the movie.In my honest opinion, although Wolverine is a X Men, this movie feels more like a stand alone film. But for the movie as a whole that is a good thing. The Wolverine did not fall flat at all. It is really engaging, and again much MUCH better than the 2009 Origins film. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes the X Men movies (specifically 1,2 and First Class) and especially to anyone who is a TRUE Wolverine fan. I myself will be buying this on blu ray when it comes out; and I do hear that there is to be an unrated cut of the movie as well.

It creates some complexities in the storyline and allows for the telling of a background past tale that allows for all the current action to take place.  In addition to a good, if not a bit flawed sometimes, storyline there are great action sequences set in various beautiful spots in Japan with some good costume design and interesting characters.  The one knock that I have with the characters is that the villians themselves are decidedly weak and the action sequences with the main bad guys seems a bit short lived toward the end.  Not to say that this movie is short as it clocks at over 2 hours but it seems that the climatic fighting scene toward the end could have been a bit more of a challenge for Wolverine.Overall though this is a solid action flick for fans like me of the X-men series.

The conflicted and troubled tough-guy who is a loner because the circumstances of his existence don't invite long-term, close relationships. So, he succumbs to his baser nature and fights pretty much everyone and every thing. He's the  grumpy and disagreeable, hard outer shell with the soft and sweet, cuddly nuggat inside. He wants to be good, but has no choice but to be bad. All that going forward, this movie relocates our North American/Canadian blue-collar hero to Japan where he pits his skill with his skeletal-metal knives and regenerative wound-healing gifts against Ninja Assassins with Bows and Arrows, Samurai Swords, and trick weapons.

It is amazing to me that anyone would think less.  The movie is loaded with action and Hugh Jackman is Wolverine, the man has the part down pat!Although I never read the comic books, I have seen all the Wolverine and XMen movies and love every one of them.If anyone does not know, Wolverine is a very powerful warrior, a mutant with special abilities.  He does not age, is at least 200 years old, remains about 45 years old, heals instantly if he is cut or shot, and springs out metal claws if he gets angry.  His entire skeletal structure is a very strong metal.  He generally tries to help the good guys and the bad guys get busted up.  (Ha Ha--when I was in Catholic school, the nun always said ""whoa-be-tied him/her/you"" when someone was in trouble for doing something bad.  Well, whoa-be-tied the bad guys around Wolverine, cause he will bust them up!.(Don't know where that expression came from, but you didn't dare ask a nun in those days:(.In the movie promo, you see an Asian man who looks seriously ill.  He is thanking Wolverine for saving his life and offering to fix it so he can live a normal life, and age and die naturally, instead of staying around watching everyone else die.In the very beginning of the movie, you see Wolverine save the life of a young Japanese soldier, in Nagasaki, Japan, when the bomb goes off (1940 something?).  Now that same soldier is old and dying.  He sends a young lady to find Wolverine and bring him to Japan so he can thank him before he dies, and offer him a favor.  Reluctantly, Wolverine agrees and goes to Japan.  The rest of the movie is in Japan, and includes a great deal of action, as well as some Ninja fighting and martial arts.  Again, it is very very good and it kept me glued to my seat.If you see this in the theater, stay with the credits and you will see scenes from the next XMen movie, slated for 2014.",5,Another Wonderful Wolverine Move -- The Saga Continues,1374883200,"07 27, 2013",2013,1966,"['see', 'movie', 'getting', 'less-than-desirable', 'reviews', 'thought', 'was', 'outstanding', 'amazing', 'anyone', 'would', 'think', 'less', 'movie', 'loaded', 'action', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Wolverine', 'man', 'part', 'down', 'pat', 'never', 'read', 'comic', 'books', 'have', 'seen', 'Wolverine', 'XMen', 'movies', 'love', 'one', 'them.If', 'anyone', 'not', 'know', 'Wolverine', 'very', 'powerful', 'warrior', 'mutant', 'special', 'abilities', 'not', 'age', 'least', '200', 'years', 'old', '45', 'years', 'old', 'heals', 'instantly', 'cut', 'shot', 'springs', 'out', 'metal', 'claws', 'angry', 'entire', 'skeletal', 'structure', 'very', 'strong', 'metal', 'generally', 'help', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'get', 'busted', 'up', 'Ha', 'Ha', 'when', 'was', 'Catholic', 'school', 'nun', 'always', 'said', 'whoa-be-tied', 'him/her/you', 'when', 'someone', 'was', 'trouble', 'doing', 'something', 'bad', 'Well', 'whoa-be-tied', 'bad', 'guys', 'Wolverine', 'cause', 'will', 'bust', 'up', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'expression', 'came', 'did', ""n't"", 'dare', 'ask', 'nun', 'days', '.In', 'movie', 'promo', 'see', 'Asian', 'man', 'who', 'seriously', 'ill', 'thanking', 'Wolverine', 'saving', 'life', 'offering', 'fix', 'so', 'can', 'live', 'normal', 'life', 'age', 'die', 'naturally', 'instead', 'staying', 'watching', 'everyone', 'else', 'very', 'beginning', 'movie', 'see', 'Wolverine', 'save', 'life', 'young', 'Japanese', 'soldier', 'Nagasaki', 'Japan', 'when', 'bomb', '1940', 'something', 'Now', 'same', 'soldier', 'old', 'dying', 'young', 'lady', 'find', 'Wolverine', 'bring', 'Japan', 'can', 'thank', 'offer', 'favor', 'Reluctantly', 'Wolverine', 'Japan', 'rest', 'movie', 'Japan', 'great', 'deal', 'action', 'as', 'well', 'Ninja', 'fighting', 'martial', 'arts', 'Again', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'kept', 'glued', 'seat.If', 'see', 'theater', 'stay', 'credits', 'will', 'see', 'scenes', 'next', 'XMen', 'movie', 'slated', '2014']",N/A

Luckily for now we have one basic archetype for the character and that is Jackman's portrayal of a violent, angry, & tortured man.Of all the films Jackman has played Wolverine in this is his best portrayal. He shows his pain, his anguish, and his fear. We have no doubts in our mind that this is wolverine.As far as the movie plot goes it is essentially the story of how a man Wolverine saved in his past wants to thank him (with possibly more sinister motivations), but things do not go as planned for either man and the plot flows from there.It is not extremely predictable though it does become obvious how it will end after a while.I will say this though. I was surprised by how subdued and mature the first 90 minutes of the film were, for the final stretch it does become a comic book film, but it is the character development and heart that made me forgive its tacky ending.This film was initially supposed to be done by Darren Aronofsky, a masterful director. It was going to be a hard R with bloody violence and nudity. and if you know Aronofsky it would've been brilliant.So for me, unlike the trailers said, this was not the wolverine I was waiting for, but it is an adequate substitute and an intelligent, but fun time.In the end this film is worth owning if you are an X-men fan, a wolverine fan, or you enjoy comic books and Japanese culture.",4,The Best Wolverine We've Got,1374796800,"07 26, 2013",2013,1483,"['Review', 'WolverineWolverine', 'one', 'characters', 'will', 'be', 'put', 'numerous', 'variations', 'interpretations', 'Luckily', 'now', 'have', 'one', 'basic', 'archetype', 'character', 'Jackman', 'portrayal', 'violent', 'angry', 'tortured', 'man.Of', 'films', 'Jackman', 'played', 'Wolverine', 'best', 'portrayal', 'pain', 'anguish', 'fear', 'have', 'doubts', 'mind', 'wolverine.As', 'far', 'movie', 'plot', 'essentially', 'story', 'how', 'man', 'Wolverine', 'saved', 'past', 'thank', 'possibly', 'more', 'sinister', 'motivations', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'planned', 'man', 'plot', 'there.It', 'not', 'extremely', 'predictable', 'become', 'obvious', 'how', 'will', 'end', 'while.I', 'will', 'say', 'though', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'subdued', 'mature', 'first', '90', 'minutes', 'film', 'were', 'final', 'stretch', 'become', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'character', 'development', 'heart', 'made', 'forgive', 'tacky', 'ending.This', 'film', 'was', 'initially', 'supposed', 'be', 'done', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'masterful', 'director', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'hard', 'R', 'bloody', 'violence', 'nudity', 'know', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'brilliant.So', 'trailers', 'said', 'was', 'not', 'wolverine', 'was', 'waiting', 'adequate', 'substitute', 'intelligent', 'fun', 'time.In', 'end', 'film', 'owning', 'are', 'X-men', 'fan', 'wolverine', 'fan', 'enjoy', 'comic', 'books', 'Japanese', 'culture']",N/A

1582062,A2W00XKTTF1G0Z,B0090SI56Y,"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa...","[3, 7]","Directed by James Mangold (Night and Day, 3:10 To Yuma), ""The Wolverine"" is the 6th installment in the Marvel X-Men series of motion pictures. From the beginning it was marvelously cast with the talents of Hugh Jackman (Les Miserable, The Prestige) who forever launched the Iconic Comic Book Super Hero who is the mutant known as The Wolverine! He always does an intense superb job in this role in every film so far.Written by Mark Bombeck (Unstoppable, Live Free Die Hard) and Scott Frank (Marley and Me, Out of Sight) the story continues from his origin film in the last movie and takes a hard look at how solitude and being anti-social has become a way of life for Logan (The Wolverine). Although not thick in depth of characters, it makes an honest attempt to appeal to the female audience with a hap-hazard love storyish thing. (Not quite as good as in the last film.)Tao Okomoto is introduced in this film as Mariko a woman who was sent on a mission to find the man who saved a Japanese military soldier during the Hiroshima attacks of WWII. Hal Yamanouchi (Push, The Wayback) plays the soldier who Logan saved over 60 years earlier by throwing him into a shelter seconds before the atomic bomb goes off. Logan only finds out the way he wants to `thank' Logan is to take away his powers of superheating and regeneration abilities in order to free him from his supposed `agony' of never dying.Now you have to have  your villains, with a fairly good cast of international Japanese actors like Rila Fukushima (Karma) playing Hal's daughter, the new head of state for a multi-billion dollar company that her father ran, Hiroyuki Sanada (Sunshine, Rush Hour 3), the wannabe billionaire and forced husband of Rila and Brian Tee (Goldmember, When We Were Soldiers) as the head of the empire security who is motivated by nothing more than money and ego. Surprise!Now throw in another mutant, Viper, played masterfully wicked by Russian actress Svetlana Khodchenkova (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) and you have a sci-fi, action adventure with some very good fighting sequences. It reminded me of the old Bruce Lee films or more modern Jackie Chan films were there are several large fight scenes with one man defeating dozens and very cleverly too! Viper is fun to watch once she gets into her `grove'.Of course there is a love story that actually slows the movie down a little and overall it does give the film a more dramatic feel to it. Too much however. I think the director was trying to make it more of a drama than an action adventure film. That's why it kind of doesn't work in parts.However if you are an X-Man movie fan, Wolverine fan or a Hugh Jackman fan, you will not be disappointed.  I think it will hold the interest of the action fans but not so appealing to everyone else for its lack of story and sappy love chimes. The finale fight sequence, although visually stunning, left me with a lot of questions however.SPOILERs: Do not leave at the credit role at the end of the film.....really. There is a short scene that was, quite honestly, better than the film itself - and it  had the audience lightly applauding when one face appeared and then roaring with cheers and applause when another cameo occurred in the same scene. I'll just say if you are a fan of Magneto and Professor X....you are going to love the credits! That's all I'm saying......",3,"""Fast Action And Some Fun Is `The Wolverine', However There Is Little Else""",1375228800,"07 31, 2013",2013,3358,"['Directed', 'James', 'Mangold', 'Night', 'Day', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'Wolverine', '6th', 'installment', 'Marvel', 'X-Men', 'series', 'motion', 'pictures', 'beginning', 'was', 'marvelously', 'cast', 'talents', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Les', 'Miserable', 'Prestige', 'who', 'forever', 'launched', 'Iconic', 'Comic', 'Book', 'Super', 'Hero', 'who', 'mutant', 'known', 'Wolverine', 'always', 'intense', 'superb', 'job', 'role', 'film', 'so', 'far.Written', 'Mark', 'Bombeck', 'Unstoppable', 'Live', 'Free', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Scott', 'Frank', 'Marley', 'Me', 'Out', 'Sight', 'story', 'origin', 'film', 'last', 'movie', 'hard', 'look', 'how', 'solitude', 'being', 'anti-social', 'become', 'way', 'life', 'Logan', 'Wolverine', 'not', 'thick', 'depth', 'characters', 'honest', 'attempt', 'appeal', 'female', 'audience', 'hap-hazard', 'love', 'storyish', 'thing', 'Not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'last', 'film', 'Tao', 'Okomoto', 'introduced', 'film', 'Mariko', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'sent', 'mission', 'find', 'man', 'who', 'saved', 'Japanese', 'military', 'soldier', 'Hiroshima', 'attacks', 'WWII', 'Hal', 'Yamanouchi', 'Push', 'Wayback', 'soldier', 'who', 'Logan', 'saved', '60', 'years', 'earlier', 'throwing', 'shelter', 'atomic', 'bomb', 'off', 'Logan', 'only', 'out', 'way', 'thank', 'Logan', 'take', 'away', 'powers', 'superheating', 'regeneration', 'abilities', 'order', 'free', 'supposed', 'agony', 'never', 'dying.Now', 'have', 'have', 'villains', 'fairly', 'good', 'cast', 'international', 'Japanese', 'actors', 'Rila', 'Fukushima', 'Karma', 'playing', 'Hal', 'daughter', 'new', 'head', 'state', 'multi-billion', 'dollar', 'company', 'father', 'ran', 'Hiroyuki', 'Sanada', 'Sunshine', 'Rush', 'Hour', '3', 'wannabe', 'billionaire', 'forced', 'husband', 'Rila', 'Brian', 'Tee', 'Goldmember', 'When', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'head', 'empire', 'security', 'who', 'motivated', 'nothing', 'more', 'money', 'ego', 'Surprise', 'Now', 'throw', 'mutant', 'Viper', 'played', 'masterfully', 'wicked', 'Russian', 'actress', 'Svetlana', 'Khodchenkova', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', 'have', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'adventure', 'very', 'good', 'fighting', 'sequences', 'reminded', 'old', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'films', 'more', 'modern', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'films', 'were', 'are', 'several', 'large', 'fight', 'scenes', 'one', 'man', 'defeating', 'dozens', 'very', 'cleverly', 'too', 'Viper', 'fun', 'watch', 'once', ""grove'.Of"", 'course', 'love', 'story', 'actually', 'movie', 'down', 'little', 'overall', 'give', 'film', 'more', 'dramatic', 'feel', 'Too', 'much', 'however', 'think', 'director', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'more', 'drama', 'action', 'adventure', 'film', 'why', 'kind', ""n't"", 'work', 'parts.However', 'are', 'X-Man', 'movie', 'fan', 'Wolverine', 'fan', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'fan', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'think', 'will', 'hold', 'interest', 'action', 'fans', 'not', 'so', 'appealing', 'everyone', 'else', 'lack', 'story', 'sappy', 'love', 'chimes', 'finale', 'fight', 'sequence', 'visually', 'stunning', 'left', 'lot', 'questions', 'however.SPOILERs', 'Do', 'not', 'leave', 'credit', 'role', 'end', 'film', '..really', 'short', 'scene', 'was', 'quite', 'honestly', 'better', 'film', 'had', 'audience', 'lightly', 'applauding', 'when', 'one', 'face', 'appeared', 'then', 'roaring', 'cheers', 'applause', 'when', 'cameo', 'occurred', 'same', 'scene', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'are', 'fan', 'Magneto', 'Professor', 'X', '.you', 'are', 'going', 'love', 'credits', ""'m"", 'saying']",N/A

1582070,A3178K9AHMHCQV,B0090SI56Y,Luminus,"[25, 33]","Wow!  This is just a review of the difference brought by the Extended cut.  Let me just make one thing clear, there's no version of Wolverine that's acceptable for children.  I don't know why Hollywood even tries.  A PG-13 berserker killer is still a berserker killer.  With that said, this extended version has more cussing.  I'm talking F-bombs and S-bombs here.  The violence is turned up to the point where Wolverine stabs one of the Yakuza and his blood (or guts) splatter onto the screen (Yes!).  There are other scenes with blood in them that I didn't notice in the theatrical version, but nothing too gory except maybe for the ninja scene.  Speaking of which, there's a a whole scene with the ninjas that was cut out of the theatrical cut that is so deliciously bloody and violent that it reminded me of Sceptic Avenger, only with blood (Saints Row 2 fans will know the reference).  If you're a Wolverine fan, don't even bother with the PG-13 version.  What's the point?  This guy is a killer and you came to see what he does best, but what he does isn't very nice.I still have to drop a star for the stupid robot, that worthless mutant called Viper (in name only), and the apparent continuity flaw in that Wolverine appears to have memories from World War II.  As far as I remember, everything from at least the weapon X program and back is a blank.  It could be argued that him visiting Nagasaki jogged his memory of his time there, but he has a memory of this on the way to Japan as he looks out the window of the plane.  Very confusing and annoying.  Also, there's no mention of the mutant cure from X3, which is ridiculous considering why Wolverine is brought to Japan in the first place (before the truth is revealed).

Don't get me wrong, Jackman is dead on with his portrayal and has delivered a pitch perfect performance.  He does an awesome job, which is why the movie gets 2 stars instead of only one star.  The fight sequences are phenomenal, the scenery and cinematography is amazing, and the movie has great pacing, and he is in eye-popping shape, but...The ending is very disappointing.  You get a finale a la Iron Man where our hero fights a bad guy in a suit of power armor.  (This is the third movie in the Marvel movie universe where this happens: Iron Man, Iron Man 2, and The Wolverine.  Four movies if you count the ending to the first Fantastic Four movie where Dr. Doom is the villain).  This type of ending has become a clich&eacute;, and it's a shame it was cut-and-pasted into the ending of The Wolverine considering the potential that this movie had.The other great disappointment is the huge plot hole involving the character of The Viper.  She poisons and weakens Logan.  So, after she weakens him, why not poison him to weaken him further, club him or poison him into unconsciousness and do what you need to do?Oh, wait, that's a much shorter movie.All in all, enjoyable to watch the fights, beautiful scenes, stupid plot with too many holes in it.

1582078,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0090SI56Y,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","Fans of the comic books involving the X-Men and in particular Wolverine were not quite happy with the first solo film involving the character. As a fan of both, I wasn't disappointed but the outcry when it was released garnered quite a bit of attention. Fortunately one group paying attention was the makers behind the new DVD release THE WOLVERINE. They've made a grittier and more true to the source film that makes up for those who were upset.Fans were well acquainted with the characters of Yukio (Rila Fukushima) and Mariko (Tao Okamato). The first was an ally of Logan aka Wolverine (a returning Hugh Jackman) and the latter the love of his life in the comic books. Both were given plenty of time to be fleshed out in the comic series RONIN done by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller. Fortunately both are given the proper treatment here in this movie.We start with Logan hallucinating following the last X-MEN film, still haunted by the death of Jean Grey. Logan is alone in the woods camping and drinking. A turn of events leads him to town and an encounter with Yukio. She tells him she is here to take him to meet her employer, Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi). In a short opening piece to the film we witnessed Logan save him while a prisoner of the Japanese during an atom bomb attack. Now Yashida is dying and wants to give a gift to Logan.When he arrives in Japan, Logan eventually meets his old friend. Dying of old age and more, Yashida offers Logan a gift that he was never able to attain, the gift of death. If you've followed the films involving Logan you know that his main mutant ability is to regenerate his cells making him invincible and also unable to die. With his current state of mind this seems like a genuine gift. All Yashida needs to do is have his doctor use a new technique on Logan. They start but before all can go according to plans Yashida passes away, leaving behind not only Logan but his power hungry son Shingen, Shingen's daughter Mariko and a group of yakuza assassins intent on taking over his company.During the funeral these yakuza assassins make an attempt on Mariko's life during which Logan is shot and realizes for the first time pain and the seriousness of wounds inflicted upon him. As the yakuza try to kidnap the young woman, Logan goes into full battle mode and rescues her. Included in this rescue is one of the most hair raising fight sequences atop a speed train that will leave your palms wet with sweat.Logan and Mariko retreat to a small village where she feels safe, a secret hideaway. While there the two fall in love but Logan remains constantly vigilant for fear of harming Mariko. Their romance is cut short when the bad guys finally catch up to them taking Mariko with them and leaving Logan behind. With the help of Yukio, Logan begins putting together the pieces of the puzzle as to who is behind it all. At the same time he reverses the experiment done to him giving him the strength and resilience he needs to come to the rescue. Trust me when I say having Wolverine unhappy with you is not a pretty picture.Battles with a band of master ninjas know as The Hand and a final confrontation with comic book character the Silver Samurai and this is bar none a movie that is filled with action. But that's not what makes it special. Along with all that action are a love story and the tale of a man trying to redeem himself for the sins of the past, a man who is not only a warrior but a man of honor, a ronin or samurai warrior with no master seeking retribution.Each actor brings a seriousness to their character that one wouldn't expect from anyone portraying a comic book hero/heroine. They flesh out their performances to make them believable in the most unbelievable world you can imagine. Jackman was born to play this role and we can only hope another fantastic script will lead him into this role once again (other than the soon to be released X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST).The action is well done, well filmed and helps to carry not just the film but the story as well as opposed to just being tossed in for the sake of action. And the story is perhaps the best thing found in this film. It isn't just men in tights flying across rooftops but a serious tale of Logan finding his path once more as well as the love of his life. Go into this one knowing ahead of time that their is more story than usual and you'll find a great movie this time around.",4,ONE RONIN,1393372800,"02 26, 2014",2014,4414,"['Fans', 'comic', 'books', 'involving', 'X-Men', 'particular', 'Wolverine', 'were', 'not', 'quite', 'happy', 'first', 'solo', 'film', 'involving', 'character', 'fan', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'outcry', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'garnered', 'quite', 'bit', 'attention', 'Fortunately', 'one', 'group', 'paying', 'attention', 'was', 'makers', 'new', 'DVD', 'release', 'THE', 'WOLVERINE', ""'ve"", 'made', 'grittier', 'more', 'true', 'source', 'film', 'up', 'who', 'were', 'upset.Fans', 'were', 'well', 'acquainted', 'characters', 'Yukio', 'Rila', 'Fukushima', 'Mariko', 'Tao', 'Okamato', 'first', 'was', 'ally', 'Logan', 'aka', 'Wolverine', 'returning', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'latter', 'love', 'life', 'comic', 'books', 'were', 'given', 'plenty', 'time', 'be', 'fleshed', 'out', 'comic', 'series', 'RONIN', 'done', 'Chris', 'Claremont', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'Fortunately', 'are', 'given', 'proper', 'treatment', 'here', 'movie.We', 'start', 'Logan', 'hallucinating', 'following', 'last', 'X-MEN', 'film', 'still', 'haunted', 'death', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'Logan', 'alone', 'woods', 'camping', 'drinking', 'turn', 'events', 'town', 'encounter', 'Yukio', 'here', 'take', 'meet', 'employer', 'Yashida', 'Hal', 'Yamanouchi', 'short', 'opening', 'piece', 'film', 'witnessed', 'Logan', 'save', 'prisoner', 'Japanese', 'atom', 'bomb', 'attack', 'Now', 'Yashida', 'dying', 'give', 'gift', 'Logan.When', 'Japan', 'Logan', 'eventually', 'old', 'friend', 'Dying', 'old', 'age', 'more', 'Yashida', 'Logan', 'gift', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'attain', 'gift', 'death', ""'ve"", 'followed', 'films', 'involving', 'Logan', 'know', 'main', 'mutant', 'ability', 'regenerate', 'cells', 'making', 'invincible', 'also', 'unable', 'die', 'current', 'state', 'mind', 'genuine', 'gift', 'Yashida', 'needs', 'do', 'have', 'doctor', 'use', 'new', 'technique', 'Logan', 'start', 'can', 'go', 'according', 'plans', 'Yashida', 'away', 'leaving', 'not', 'only', 'Logan', 'power', 'hungry', 'son', 'Shingen', 'Shingen', 'daughter', 'Mariko', 'group', 'yakuza', 'assassins', 'intent', 'taking', 'over', 'company.During', 'funeral', 'yakuza', 'assassins', 'make', 'attempt', 'Mariko', 'life', 'Logan', 'shot', 'first', 'time', 'pain', 'seriousness', 'wounds', 'inflicted', 'yakuza', 'try', 'kidnap', 'young', 'woman', 'Logan', 'full', 'battle', 'mode', 'Included', 'rescue', 'one', 'most', 'hair', 'raising', 'fight', 'sequences', 'atop', 'speed', 'train', 'will', 'leave', 'palms', 'wet', 'sweat.Logan', 'Mariko', 'retreat', 'small', 'village', 'where', 'safe', 'secret', 'hideaway', 'two', 'fall', 'love', 'Logan', 'constantly', 'vigilant', 'fear', 'harming', 'Mariko', 'romance', 'cut', 'short', 'when', 'bad', 'guys', 'finally', 'catch', 'up', 'taking', 'Mariko', 'leaving', 'Logan', 'help', 'Yukio', 'Logan', 'putting', 'together', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'who', 'same', 'time', 'experiment', 'done', 'giving', 'strength', 'resilience', 'come', 'rescue', 'Trust', 'when', 'say', 'having', 'Wolverine', 'unhappy', 'not', 'pretty', 'picture.Battles', 'band', 'master', 'ninjas', 'know', 'Hand', 'final', 'confrontation', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'Silver', 'Samurai', 'bar', 'none', 'movie', 'filled', 'action', 'not', 'what', 'special', 'action', 'are', 'love', 'story', 'tale', 'man', 'trying', 'redeem', 'sins', 'past', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'warrior', 'man', 'honor', 'ronin', 'samurai', 'warrior', 'master', 'seeking', 'retribution.Each', 'actor', 'seriousness', 'character', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anyone', 'portraying', 'comic', 'book', 'hero/heroine', 'flesh', 'out', 'performances', 'make', 'believable', 'most', 'unbelievable', 'world', 'can', 'imagine', 'Jackman', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'role', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'fantastic', 'script', 'will', 'lead', 'role', 'once', 'again', 'other', 'soon', 'be', 'released', 'X-MEN', 'DAYS', 'FUTURE', 'PAST', '.The', 'action', 'well', 'done', 'well', 'filmed', 'carry', 'not', 'just', 'film', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'opposed', 'just', 'being', 'tossed', 'sake', 'action', 'story', 'perhaps', 'best', 'thing', 'found', 'film', ""n't"", 'just', 'men', 'tights', 'flying', 'rooftops', 'serious', 'tale', 'Logan', 'finding', 'path', 'once', 'more', 'as', 'well', 'love', 'life', 'Go', 'one', 'knowing', 'ahead', 'time', 'more', 'story', 'usual', ""'ll"", 'find', 'great', 'movie', 'time', 'around']",N/A

Then X-men: First Class got me excited again, but I had completely lost interest with the modern storyline. X2 is the best of the originals, but it still has it's hokey moments and general kid-friendliness. Xmen 1 is decent, but not my favorite. I never really loved an X-men movie until first class.So when they announced The Wolverine, I didn't get too excited. But then I heard that they wanted to do it in Japan, Mangold was a good director, but I still didn't really feel the motivation. And then I read that Mangold said he had an extended and R-rated version of his movie. That had me curious. The trailer for the movie didn't sell me at all, but I'm a cinephile, so I figured I'll wait and see the unrated version, although I assumed it would be indistinguishably different.Having just watched The Wolverine, I can say this is the best X-men film yet. Better than X2 and better than First Class (both of which I really dug)The movie feels adult. I can't stress enough how much I mean that as a compliment. There is no goofiness, no terrible one liners, winks at the audience about other X-men or Marvel references. This is an honest to it's story and focused on it. Wolverine's claws maim people and he smokes and swears. And with the unrated edition, one might think this would be video game levels of violence. Amazingly not the case. It's unhinged but reserved at the same time. Restraint was shown and yet nothing feels held back.Not since Nolan's Bat films have I really felt a superhero movie that was mature. This didn't feel like a superhero movie, it felt like an action film abotu a guy with claws. And it's so much better for it.With The Avengers, Batman vs Superman, and X-men Days of Future Past, we aren't afforded opportunities to tell focused superhero stories anymore. Here we got actual character development, and a story that was smaller but all the better for it. Last time I appreciated a smaller film like this was Thor.Bottom line, this is the best X-men film, but you wouldn't know it. It stands on it's own as a very mature film. I hope future superhero films take a page out of Mangold's book. And now I'm not at all disappointed there will be another one.

1582105,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B0090SI56Y,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[2, 4]","With its modern-day sensibilities and philosophical and moral questions about genetics, the ""X-Men"" comic series has always been tailor-made for a movie treatment. Of its cast of characters, perhaps the most untapped is Wolverine (Hugh Jackson), who is practically immortal and indestructible.  He's the most physically capable of the X-Men, the most experienced, and the least likely to die, so you can pretty much drop Wolverine into any plot.  And that's how we've finally arrived at ""The Wolverine,"" which is basically Wolverine vs. ninjas.  It's about time.The plot challenge for scriptwriters is his level of power.  Although Wolverine isn't say, Thor or Hulk, he's almost impossible to kill, which means the audience isn't particularly vested in his survival.  This is brought home in the first few minutes of the film when Wolverine survives an atomic blast at Nagasaki. Yashia (Haruhiko Yamanouchi), the officer he saves, propels the plot. Yashida has become CEO of a massive technology corporation, and he sends mutant Yukio (Rila Fukushima) for a deal on his deathbed:  an exchange of Wolverine's immortality to let the old man live and end Logan's torment over the death of his one true love, Jean Grey (a radiant Famke Janssen).  Wolverine turns him down of course, but not before becoming embroiled in Japan's underworld politics over Yashida's estate between ninjas and yakuza with Yashida's granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) in the middle.  And it's about this point in the film when Wolverine gets ""de-powered"" to make things interesting.Wolverine suddenly discovers he's only ""nigh-invulnerable"" to use a term from ""The Tick"": He can still feel pain even if it doesn't kill him. This amps up the action as Wolverine gets shot, stabbed, sliced, and punched by Yakuza thugs and ninjas in a variety of interesting locations: on rooftops, in trains, and on the rooftops of high-speed trains.  It's thrilling stuff.Unfortunately it can't last.  The Big Bad reveal isn't much of a twist, and the final villain is  a hilariously over-the-top slice of comic cheesiness. It's no coincidence that this shift happens along with Wolverine back to his old self -- which is a shame.  Wolverine just a little weaker makes him that much more interesting.Wolverine isn't a chatty character, and although his sequences with Jean Grey certainly help to give some poignancy to a loner who would otherwise brood silently, there's only so much to work with.  The other characters just circle his orbit, including a badly dubbed Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) whose skintight green cat suit and whack-a-doo powers (she has a poison tongue! a poison kiss! sometimes you die -- but not always!) feels forced in an otherwise tonally Japanese film that's willing to use subtitles for the majority of its dialogue.""The Wolverine"" has claws, but they're not adamantium.

A solider from the Japanese prison camp is rescued by Wolverine and owes him his life. Cut to many years later, Logan is now a bum in the woods working for the animal protection agency of horribly fake CGI bears. A bear is killed, and Logan is off to the bar for a brawl. That's where he meets the granddaughter of the man from Japan who tells him not to bother with small men, and to come with her to Japan so her now dying grandfather can say goodbye and get one last kiss from Logan. Logan and her go back to Japan and it turns out her dying grandfather owns the biggest corporation in Japan and he actually wants to find out how to regenerate/heal himself as Logan can. Fights, fights, snore, snore, fight, snore, fight, robot, snore, end.Overall, the opening scene has a slow motion explosion with a lot of people running around as a bomb is about to go off. Not all that much action. Then onto a long and drawn out snore fest of talking about this and that, and stupid dream sequences of whats-her-face now in love with Logan and not Cyclops. Makes sense, right? No. Pay's off in the end but, right? No.There is 2 and a half mutants in this whole movie. This is X-Men right? The only new mutant other than Logan is a doctor introduced who is called Viper. She is a terrible actress, and a pretty disappointing character. All she does is sheds and licks things to death while having an annoying over confident attitude. Her role is pretty pathetic. The other one is the granddaughter of the Japanese guy, I think her name was Red Head Chun Li or something? and her sister is Princess no-body. Her mutant power? Shes a psychic. Is she even a mutant? Hardly. But you hear a reference to genes skipping a generation and she copped it. Lame, she's not a mutant. They only claim she is.So, Logan is infected with something and loses his ability to heal, yet has enough remaining mutant power to not be killed by bullets and arrows and anything else they shoot at him. Does this sound familiar? A super hero loses his power and has to learn to remember what is like to be vulnerable again? Anyway, in the end Tony Stark, I mean Logan regains his powers, turns into the wolf and wins the high school basketball game. Wait, wrong movie again. Oh yeah, he earns a body guard and goes nowhere... literately.There is not enough action, too much boring talking, and a stupid ending with Robo-Samari Man. Really, 2 and a bit mutants, one Wolverine, and a robot bad guy? What kind of X-men movie do you call this? I say it happened like this. ""Mr Jackman, we had a bunch of monkeys write a script to cash in on the X-men franchise. It's really sucky, but we will pay you a couple of million, sign here please"".It's bad enough the prices to see movies in theatres these days, and there overpriced watered down drinks and expensive foods... people pay good money for these things these days... and yet they still produce crap like this today? IN AN X-MEN MOVIE? My god. WHY, HOW did this get made? WHO gave it the green light?

1582116,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,B0090SI56Y,mitchell5954,"[3, 5]","After the last three installments in the X-Men franchise (even First Class) I had little hope left that they could turn this dead franchise around.  When I saw the trailer to the Wolverine I got a bit excited, but I was not holding my breath.  I went to see it and I really enjoyed the film.  I will say that this is my second favorite film in the franchise.  X2 is still my all-time favorite X-Men movie, but The Wolverine is a close second.The Wolverine is what X-Men Origins should have been.  Unlike that film this film is actually about Wolverine himself and his journey.  Origins was supposedly about Wolverine but, like X-Men 3, tried to shove in as many other mutants as possible, which took away from Wolverine&#8217;s story.  This film has other mutants, but there are very few and do not detract from Wolverine.The film has Wolverine dealing with the events of X-Men 3 which I actually like.  It does not make the Last Stand a better movie but it does make it more significant overall.  After he killed Gene at the end of X3 he has gone off the radar, is living like a hermit in the woods and has lost purpose in his life.  This film is all about Wolverine finding new purpose and coming to terms with who he really is.  Throughout the X-Men films Wolverine has been trying to fight his nature, which is the animal who acts on instincts.  In this movie he comes to realize that the animal is a part of who he is and accepts it, and in turn finds new purpose in his life.  This film is definitely one of the deepest X-Men movies and delves into Wolverine as a person, which is what Origins should have done.Another thing that this film has going is the action scenes.  The action scenes are fun, thrilling, and actually pretty graphic.  This film is definitely the most violent of the X-Men movies.  The X-Men films up until now had very little blood.  In this film when people get hurt or die you see the effects.  When Wolverine cuts people with his claws there is actually blood.  There is one scene with Wolverine that is particularly graphic.  For those who have seen the film, you guys know what scene I am referring to.  This film is not Watchmen violent but it is pretty graphic for children.  The effects are also very well done.  The effects in this film are leagues better than the effects in Origins and First Class.  I cannot say if the 3D is good or not because my theatre only shows 2D.Hugh Jackman is back as Wolverine and does a phenomenal job once again.  However, he is not the only one who did great here.  Tao Okamoto (Mariko) and Rila Fukushima (Yukio) did a magnificent job too.  The surprising thing is this is the first big movie that the two of them were in.  Before this they mostly worked as models.  They did very good for their first time and hopefully we will see them in more movies.  The villain was great and had a lot of dimension to him.  I like how the villain knew Wolverine before, which gives him a personal connection to Wolverine.  He reminds me of Striker quite a bit.  The one character/actress that I did not care for is Viper (Svetlana).  I found her acting to be a bit over-the-top.

1582122,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B0090SI56Y,M. Oleson,"[1, 2]","There may be spoilers.I have to admit I was beginning to wear out my ears with the usual summer onslaught of loud, violent (but PG-13 of course) action films.  Mostly due to the overlong final acts.  I was expecting something similar here but surprise, the movie is good from beginning to end.  Sure the final sequence is a bit much but there aren't cities, skylines or military manpower and armament being destroyed.We first see Logan aka The Wolverine hanging out in the rain in a Yukon forest.  He's still despondent after killing his beloved Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) in a previous X-Men episode.  He still dreams about her.  I did think the numerous sequences were a bit of a distraction.  A young Japanese swordswoman (Rila Fukushima) has tracked Logan down and asks him to come to Tokyo to say goodbye to an old, dying man (Hal Yamanouchi) whose life was saved by Logan when the ""Big One"" was dropped on Nagasaki to close out WW II.Once there, Logan discovers that Yashida is indeed on his death bed but also one of the great high-tech industrialists in Japan.  His impending death is creating a power struggle between his son, his granddaughter, corrupt politicians and the Yakusa crime lords.  Logan picks cute Mariko (Tao Okamoto), the granddaughter to hang with and of course protect.There are additional complications.  Logan's ability to quickly heal are waning thanks to a long-stemmed blond temptress called Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) who is also a chemist working with Yashida to extend his life.  Maybe the Wolverine's powers can be fed to the old man?Director James Mangold, working with writers Mark Bomback and Scott Frank, are to be commended for making Logan's character down to Earth while not removing his fierceness.  As the relationship between Logan and Mariko becomes...uh...closer, he still keeps a distance understanding that her character will likely not work in future storylines.  Action fans should not be disappointed either.  There are plenty of well-choreographed fight scenes early on and throughout the film, the best being Logan vs. a Yakusa henchman in and on top of a speeding bullet train.  Sure, we've seen this before including this year in ""The Lone Ranger.""

My biggest problem with it is:When Wolverine gets his claws chopped off it makes no sense. So yeah they were chopped off by a hot adamanitum blade. This should have never happened because A. According to X-2; once adamantium sets (into solid form, from liquid) it can never be destroyed NOT EVEN BY OTHER ADAMANTIUM, yet his claws seem to come right off. B. In X-2 supposedly the adamantium used on the girl with the claws (when wolverine injected her with liquid adamantium) was the last amount of adamntium in existence, yet they have enough to make a giant adamantium samurai???  My other problem with the movie is it doesn't make sense how he was able to take logan's healing power through his claws... this is ridiculous.

This one does not measure up.First of all, this is a Japanese movie.  Except for the good mutant, Wolverine, and the evil mutant, Viper, all of the other characters are Japanese and all the action takes place in Japan.Although there is some action, it is a typical Japanese film with overacting and giant robots.  I'm surprised it wasn't done as an animated film.However, I must admit this movie lost me in the first scene.  As anyone who knows anything about World War II, American POWS were treated horribly, usually starved and often tortured to death.  When Japanese troops pulled back, they tended to execute all their prisoners(See the movie &#34;The Great Raid&#34; if you can't be bothered to read a book.).  There were standing orders that if the Japanese home islands were invaded, every POW in the country was to be put to death. Yet, in the opening scene of this movie, an airraid  is in progress.  Of course, there is no way the Japanese could have known it was an atomic attack.  The compassionate Japanese guards(all four of them) release all the American POWs so they won't be hurt and then commit ritual suicide.  This is revisionist history at its worst.

Like Hugh Jackman, I enjoy the character for his own dramatic potential.That said, I`ll keep the movie review short: This film delivers a better Wolverine than the 'Origins' (so-called) stand-alone Wolverine movie.....Logan gets center-stage here for real this time, and Jackman makes the best of it. The storyline--based upon the  classic Claremont/Byrne Wolverine limited series--is merely okay, due to the Claremont/Byrne tale being unfortunately altered for some bizarre, unexplained reason...The old saying goes ""If It Ain`t Broke, Don`t Fix It"", but Hollywood seems to never quite grasp the value of that.....sadly.This was a good Wolverine movie....BUT...It could have been great.""Of All The Sentiments Of Word Or Pen, The Saddest Are; 'It Might Have Been""Now...for THE MARKETING.....Call me a curmudgeon..call me crazy if you wish...But I am tired of multiple-disc set offerings .

1582183,ALWB64XOXNMDP,B0090SI56Y,Picardfan007,"[4, 5]","Spoiler Alert!  I've revealed some plot points of the new Wolverine movie on DVD! So you have been told before you start this review. What I did see, before the movie put me to sleep, is revealed in the  review! I didn't reveal too much if you saw the trailer on line or TV.After watching most of the Wolverine movie on DVD, I have to admit, it put me to sleep! I'm  giving you my first impression of what this alleged action extravaganza  was while watching it! The resemblance to the Frank Miller  and Chris Claremont  comic novel was very thin indeed! Wolverine has to go up against larger than life characters to make a good film. He did in this one. However, it was at the very end, with a battle against  Silver Samurai.Like any a good actor or show biz personality, you can tolerate an actor in a bad film.  Usually the actor, if they are good, can transcend any of the bad material that passes for a script. This was the case in Wolverine.  I can forgive the first movie because they threw so many heroes and villains up on the screen.  The producers wanted to see what concepts would stick.This plot brings our favorite X Man to Japan where he finds an old friend he rescued from ""the bomb"" in World War II. His friend, who turns out not to be,  takes away his immortality along with his healing powers. After that it all goes downhill.  Sony, the company that owns the X-Men, doesn't have the slightest idea of what the character is about.  When you put the character up against ordinary villains, you get an ordinary movie!If the producers and writers of this film read the comics, it might have been a worthwhile endeavor.  Directors disassociate them from the source material, because they find it below their intellectual threshold.  While it was better than the first entry, this one is marginally better.  That isn't saying much because Wolverine is known world wide as the best character in the X-Men.  When will we see an actual movie that is worthy of character?  Perhaps in X-Men: Days of Future Past. That's the next entry in the Bryan Singer directed movie coming out next year.  If that one is anything like ""The Wolverine""; I'll be waiting for that movie to hit the $5 Wal-Mart bin.When Wolverine made his debut in 1974 in The Incredible Hulk comic #181; he actually fought the Hulk!  Why couldn't one of the movies recreate that battle on screen?

BUT...he is never out of the fight for any length of time, and his ability to be an iron-suited hero is never challenged. Wolverine was a warrior I could watch lay waste to armies of bad guys and never flinch. THEN...he is shot, knifed, beat up, deprived of his claws, and in love, with two women yet! Bad guys generally get one crack at eliminating the hero, but in this movie they are constantly knocking the crap out of the X-men's coolest member. Why? Because Wolverine, for all his strutting, and for all his bad-ass clawing, is still a man who is susceptible to the same failings as all men - his love of a woman gets in the way of his common sense and natural intuitive ability to see a train is really behind the bright light coming down the tracks! Hugh Jackman is great though, really, No matter which gender, no one could look at this man without a shirt on and complain. Even the wounds look good on this guy, and there are plenty of those, trust me. The science behind the Wolverine has been explained in X-men and previous Wolverine sagas, so it doesn't really play a part in the film, though one bad guy wants his secret and is willing to kill him to get it. But, hey, what else would a truly bad, once saved by the hero - now dying, guy do if not try for immortality. I love movies that put an immortal hero into the role of the mortal man, with the weaknesses of one as well - otherwise, let's face it, the movie, (or book), would be boring to a fault! One star off because I really feel that Wolverine was too battered during the entire movie, despite the reason for not being able to heal instantly now and again. My problem, or that of the movie world in general, is that once a god is made mortal, why is still impossible to kill him? or her? We mortals drop like flies but the once immortal seem impervious to death even though there is no longer a &#34;trick&#34; to their continued existence. Admantium anyone?

Logan is living alone in the mountains in fear that if he is around other people he will hurt them like he hurt Jean Grey (killed in X-Men: The Last Stand). When Logan is summoned by an old dying acquaintance from World War II, he decides to pay his respects and travel to Japan to say farewell to his friend. Soon after he arrives he realizes that he was called there for a different purpose. Yashida, the man from Logan's past has brought him to Japan to offer him mortality so that Logan can finally be at peace. When he realizes that not all is as it seems with the powerful Yashida family, he has to face the tough decision whether to give up his life as Wolverine completely, or defend the Yashida empire. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Raven D recommends the film to X-Men fans or ""anyone who wants some action and entertainment.""I really like this film. I was a bit confused at the beginning because it's been years since I first saw ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" which plays a big part in this film. Once I jogged my memory a bit, the plot was perfect. The 3D in this film is incredible because it isn't over the top. It is very subtle in a way that makes the images clearer and more realistic, but doesn't have things jumping off the screen. The plot twists are very nice even if they are a bit predictable. All in all I am very pleased with the outcome of ""The Wolverine.""My favorite character has to be Yukio played by Rila Fukushima. She is a very spunky character who is sent to find and bring Logan to Japan to say goodbye to her master. She has incredible martial arts skills and is a very funny character. She is very small, so you wouldn't expect her to be a fighter, but she ends up calling herself Logan's ""bodyguard."" I also like Hugh Jackman's character Wolverine/Logan. He is very hesitant to go to Japan because he has left his identity of Wolverine behind him but, when he sees that innocent people are going to be hurt, he fights for them. Although he is a very tough character, you can see that he has a soft side, which we wee through his many visions of Jean and his sleeplessness because he misses her.My favorite scene is when Logan battles the Yakuza mob on top of a bullet train. It is such a fast paced, high action fighting sequence that it kept me on the edge of my seat. It was also very unique because it happens on top of a train moving hundreds of miles an hour, so the participants of the fight are almost flying through the air.I recommend this film for ages 13+ for the action, violence and mature situations. This movie is perfect for X-Men fans or if you just want some action and entertainment. I give ""The Wolverine"" 5 out of 5 stars, so be sure to check it out when it hits theaters on July 26th.

1582210,AO6L5RJILSLDX,B0090SI56Y,"R. Long ""Tessie's Boy""","[5, 8]","The Wolverine (2013)*************************What is it about Wolverine movies that makes writers and directors want to overcomplicate them, or fiddle with pulp perfection? Here's how you make a Wolverine movie:1. Have Wolverine act gruff.2. Have Wolverine hand-stab the crap out of a bunch of bad guys.3. Don't change characters who don't need to be changed, and don't add a bunch of unnecessary characters from other comics who don't have a whole lot to do with Wolverine.That's it!! How hard is that, really? And yet this is the second time that the seemingly simple task of making a good Wolverine has been mucked up by bad writing and unnecessary flourishes. In this instance, the failure is even more painful because, for the first 3/4ths of its running time, The Wolverine is a terrific little action movie. Hugh Jackman has never been better in the role, nailing once and for all that tricky mix between soulfulness and savagery that makes Logan who he is. He wasn't overplaying the tough guy, nor was he the prone-to-tears Wolvie that has been seen in other films in the X franchise. The action was pretty brutal and, I think, pushed the PG-13 rating to its limit. The performers were all game and capable actors. What I really like about The Wolverine is the lack of bombast found in the other X-Men films. This film is lean, quiet in parts. Some of its scenes (particularly the ones where Mariko and Logan simply talk like two human beings might) wouldn't be out of place in a typical arthouse movie. And then, of course, the final 20 minutes throws all of that hard work right out the window.Ohhhh, that ending. It seems like filmmakers who tackle a Wolverine film just can't manage to stick the landing. The script basically falls off a cliff and lands back in X-Men Origins: Wolverine territory; what was a pretty good, character-driven action movie becomes a mishmash of superhero noise and mayhem, misused characters (not quite as bad as Deadpool in the Origins movie, but pretty damn bad) and plot developments that make not a lick of sense.Now for those who aren't aware, the main elements of The Wolverine's story were loosely based on the legendary 1982 miniseries by Chris Claremont & Frank Miller. It's a nearly perfect, self-contained story about Wolverine taking on the Yakuza in Japan to save the woman he loves and his journey of self-discovery along the way, among other things. I was thrilled when I first heard they were adapting the story for this sequel. When I went to see this movie, I knew the story would not be presented unaltered, and while that was initially disappointing, I was won over and I began to appreciate the movie for what it was, rather than what it wasn't, which is rare for me as a comic book fan who's seen many a faithless film adaptation. As the final reel started to roll, though, The Wolverine took all of that goodwill and burned it like a guy lighting a cheap stogie with a $50 bill. That's the kind of whiplash that this movie gave me.Here's my final word on The Wolverine: watch the first 3/4ths, then just pretend Logan saved the day right then and there after defeating ninjas in the snowy village. Then, fast forward to the end scene between Logan and Mariko--no idiotic final fight required. (Definitely stay for the post-credits scene!) Otherwise, you may find yourself regretting your decision to get so invested in what is, until that last fatal stumble, a nearly-great movie.3.5 stars out of 5, rounded up to 4 stars.********************The WolverineStarring: Hugh JackmanDirected by: James MangoldRated: PG-13Release Year: 2013",4,"As good as it's going to get, I imagine.",1376265600,"08 12, 2013",2013,3597,"['Wolverine', '2013', 'Wolverine', 'movies', 'writers', 'directors', 'want', 'overcomplicate', 'fiddle', 'pulp', 'perfection', 'Here', 'how', 'make', 'Wolverine', 'movie:1', 'Have', 'Wolverine', 'act', 'gruff.2', 'Have', 'Wolverine', 'hand-stab', 'crap', 'bunch', 'bad', 'guys.3', 'Do', ""n't"", 'change', 'characters', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'changed', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'bunch', 'unnecessary', 'characters', 'other', 'comics', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'whole', 'lot', 'do', 'Wolverine.That', 'How', 'hard', 'really', 'yet', 'second', 'time', 'seemingly', 'simple', 'task', 'making', 'good', 'Wolverine', 'been', 'mucked', 'up', 'bad', 'writing', 'unnecessary', 'flourishes', 'instance', 'failure', 'even', 'more', 'painful', 'first', '3/4ths', 'running', 'time', 'Wolverine', 'terrific', 'little', 'action', 'movie', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'role', 'nailing', 'once', 'tricky', 'mix', 'soulfulness', 'savagery', 'Logan', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'overplaying', 'tough', 'guy', 'was', 'prone-to-tears', 'Wolvie', 'been', 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'X', 'franchise', 'action', 'was', 'pretty', 'brutal', 'think', 'pushed', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'limit', 'performers', 'were', 'game', 'capable', 'actors', 'What', 'really', 'Wolverine', 'lack', 'bombast', 'found', 'other', 'X-Men', 'films', 'film', 'lean', 'quiet', 'parts', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'ones', 'where', 'Mariko', 'Logan', 'simply', 'talk', 'two', 'human', 'beings', 'might', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'place', 'typical', 'arthouse', 'movie', 'then', 'course', 'final', '20', 'minutes', 'hard', 'work', 'right', 'window.Ohhhh', 'ending', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'tackle', 'Wolverine', 'film', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'manage', 'stick', 'landing', 'script', 'basically', 'cliff', 'back', 'X-Men', 'Origins', 'Wolverine', 'territory', 'what', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'character-driven', 'action', 'movie', 'mishmash', 'superhero', 'noise', 'mayhem', 'misused', 'characters', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'bad', 'Deadpool', 'Origins', 'movie', 'pretty', 'damn', 'bad', 'plot', 'developments', 'make', 'not', 'lick', 'sense.Now', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'aware', 'main', 'elements', 'Wolverine', 'story', 'were', 'loosely', 'based', 'legendary', '1982', 'miniseries', 'Chris', 'Claremont', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'self-contained', 'story', 'Wolverine', 'taking', 'Yakuza', 'Japan', 'save', 'woman', 'journey', 'self-discovery', 'way', 'other', 'things', 'was', 'thrilled', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'were', 'adapting', 'story', 'sequel', 'When', 'went', 'see', 'movie', 'knew', 'story', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'presented', 'unaltered', 'was', 'initially', 'disappointing', 'was', 'won', 'began', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'what', 'was', 'rather', 'what', 'was', ""n't"", 'rare', 'comic', 'book', 'fan', 'who', 'seen', 'many', 'faithless', 'film', 'adaptation', 'final', 'reel', 'started', 'roll', 'Wolverine', 'took', 'goodwill', 'burned', 'guy', 'lighting', 'cheap', 'stogie', '50', 'bill', 'kind', 'whiplash', 'movie', 'gave', 'final', 'word', 'Wolverine', 'watch', 'first', '3/4ths', 'then', 'just', 'pretend', 'Logan', 'saved', 'day', 'right', 'then', 'there', 'defeating', 'ninjas', 'snowy', 'village', 'Then', 'fast', 'forward', 'end', 'scene', 'Logan', 'Mariko', 'idiotic', 'final', 'fight', 'required', 'Definitely', 'stay', 'post-credits', 'scene', 'Otherwise', 'may', 'find', 'regretting', 'decision', 'get', 'so', 'invested', 'what', 'last', 'fatal', 'stumble', 'nearly-great', 'movie.3.5', '5', 'rounded', 'up', '4', 'stars', '********************The', 'WolverineStarring', 'Hugh', 'JackmanDirected', 'James', 'MangoldRated', 'PG-13Release', 'Year', '2013']",N/A

All Logan wants is to be left alone to live as a hermit, spending his boundless days working as a logger, brooding over his condition and occasionally talking to the dead wife he accidentally killed who shows up occasionally to convince him to do away with himself and join her on the other side (apparently, she doesn't quite get this whole &#34;immortality&#34; thing).But like Michael Corleone in &#34;Godfather III,&#34; every time Logan thinks he's out, someone pulls him back in.

But after seeing this film I was blown away how much better the quality, action, and plot were.  The best element I loved best about this film was the showcase of different Japanese martial arts, and Japanese culture.  The arts of Kendo (fencing), Ninjitsu, Iaido, Aikido-Jujitsu, and some Karate were executed very well and accurately for the short time interval they had to show the martial arts.Wolverine Logan, played perfectly in my opinion by Mr. Jackman, is tied with Batman as the best superhero I have ever seen portrayed on film.  Finally now in the 2000's & 2010's decades we are seeing a decent portrayal of these comic book icons that reach a level of believability that was not achievable prior to that.The only weak link in this film is the ""Viper"" character, it's like she just doesn't fit or isn't developed enough.What I also love most about Wolverine is that unlike Batman and Tony Stark he has absolutely no money, he lives life at the poorest levels of society but still manages to do the morally right thing. Wolverine-Logan stands up for justice while on top of it all just surviving in a harsh world.Wolverine is a fine military combat veteran, a true patriot freedom fighter (from the Canadian perspective), serving with out any regard for politics nor financial gain.  Logan Wolverine lives with the scars of that service ,being that he is almost immortal witnessing his comrades and the women he loves perish, all the while he goes onward living with the pain of immortality.Clearly what doesn't make any sense is why does Marvel or Hollywood even bother making this franchise for kids?  Can they not decide what audience they want?  Wolverine is really not a kids character at all.  What this film, along with the new Batman movies, needs is a rated R extension.  I did hear the unrated or deleted scene addition to this film is excellent.Another problem with Jackman's Wolverine is, he is light years ahead of every other X-Men character!  In DOFP, when Jackman is teamed up with the other X-Men characters it equates to Clint Eastwood teaming up with Gumby, or John Wayne with Bugs Bunny.  These characters are pathetic when compared to the Wolverine!Jackman is such a great actor, that he's perfect as this character.

He wanted to be a normal guy again, but the world needed him back! (That's good. First time they did that, and it made sense!)Second, it was Thor. Oh no, he has no hammer? Make the movie about that! He's going to be a hero without it! (Okay, but it's kind of been done.)Third, Iron Man 3. Oh no, he has no armor, but only half the time...so it's okay? That's kind of new right??? What would he do without armor? Be a hero without it?!?! (Really?)Now, the Wolverine. Guess, what? Here we go again!!!Let's make this guy weak!!! How can we do this? That's easy! Let's do it again!

I'm Logan!!! Why is this movie calling me, the Wolverine? It should be calling me, LOGAN!!!Wait a second? Isn't this the almost the same idea of Spider Man 2? Do I really want to be Spider-Man turned into do I really want to be the Wolverine???Oh yes, I get it! In this movie because he's weak in the head/body/soul basically, everything you can think of--that's him now. Logan's started to let go and really didn't want to be Wolverine. Then, at the end of the movie, he decided he needed his powers and wanted to be a hero again. Go, Spidy, Go!!! Uhhh, I mean Wolverine!I thought this movie didn't have enough action. Used the same concepts over again. Did a okay job with the story for the beginning and end, but failed a lot in the rest of the movie. The director tried too hard to make people laugh and did many comedy scenes.I swear, they're going to cycle this concept over again. Let's do Cap next! Let's just take away his shield and his abilities! It's like watching a whole new movie. NOT!!!

I'd say it's more like a hard PG-13 rather than an R-rated cut.The UNRATED Cut is much better than the theatrical cut.**Note, SPOILERS follow, so read at your own risk**.1) There is more gore, but primarily CGI blood sprays.  Some shots of Wolverine's claws going through people's limbs, but nothing explicit.  No graphic dismemberments.2) Wolverine drops a few more f-bombs.3) Some of the opening scenes depicting Wolverine at the POW camp are a little longer.4) The scene involving Wolverine, an arrow, and the hunter is slightly longer and more brutal.5) Slightly longer dialogue with Yukio on the way to the plane.6) Relationship between Mariko and Yashida and Shingen and  Yashida is better fleshed out in the unrated cut.7) A new scene where Yashida asks Logan his age.8) A new scene with Yashida talking to Shingen on his deathbed, telling him, ""You are not the man to lead Yashida"".9) A new scene at the love hotel where the Yakuza show up and get into a fight with Wolverine.  Mariko intervenes and demonstrates some fighting skill as well.10) Wolverine's operation on himself is bloodier.11) The fight scene between Shingen and Wolverine is slightly longer and now depicts Shingen rather graphically cutting into Wolverine's shoulder blade (no blood though).12) A new scene where Viper gives Hadana poison for his arrows, which he later uses to bring down Wolverine at the ninja fight.13) The ninja fight scene is now much longer.  Wolverine gets dragged away in nets and hit by ninjas on bikes.  Yukio shows up to assist Wolverine and drives around in a snow plow chopping up hapless ninjas (some hearty blood spraying).  Wolverine lights his familiar cigar midway through the battle.I'm actually glad the extra action scenes were removed from the theatrical cut.  Some of the action seemed a bit silly (e.g. ninjas hitting Wolverine with their motorbikes, although Wolverine lighting his trademark cigar was nifty).  Furthermore, Yukio's appearance detracted from Wolverine's thematic solo search for Mariko.

Oh, it's nicely done and with some great special effects and action sequences, and I certainly don't expect a multi-layered, Oscar-worthy script with heavy character development when going into a film like this one. And yet, I've enjoyed past 'X-Men' films for this reason; that I grew to know and like the main characters, even if the bad guys sometimes came off as cartoonish.Here, it's all sort of cartoonish. A good film, but Wolverine - who spends a great deal of the film mourning (and dreaming about) the loss of his beloved Jean Grey, is brooding and dark and fairly depressing throughout. And the plot - Wolverine, a recluse living in the woods after all that is happened, is summoned to Japan to say goodbye to a dying old friend he saved during the Nagasaki bombing in World War II - is a bit both superficial and artificial, with a subplot involving the friend's granddaughter that gets Wolverine into all kinds of mess with both the Yakuza and a serpent-tongued (literally) mutant who has found a way to render Wolvering all but mortal.NOT a bad film ... but with little substance, many cartoon characters for characters, a script that needed a couple more rewrites, and an unnecessary romantic subplot for Wolverine that goes nowhere. On the plus side, it has Hugh Jackman, great visuals, a pretty wicked ""final battle"" ending, Will Yun Lee, and the film's best asset beyond Jackman - Rila Fukushima, who is totally kick-ass as Yukio (also the fight/chase scene that starts at the funeral and ends on a bullet train - that, and Fukushima, are worth seeing the film for ALONE).",3,"Very good, could have been better with less Jean Grey and more of the old Wolverine we know and love",1385683200,"11 29, 2013",2013,1675,"['have', 'admit', 'reflection', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', ""'The"", 'Wolverine', 'Oh', 'nicely', 'done', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'action', 'sequences', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'multi-layered', 'Oscar-worthy', 'script', 'heavy', 'character', 'development', 'when', 'going', 'film', 'one', 'yet', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'X-Men', 'films', 'reason', 'grew', 'know', 'main', 'characters', 'even', 'bad', 'guys', 'sometimes', 'came', 'off', 'cartoonish.Here', 'sort', 'cartoonish', 'good', 'film', 'Wolverine', 'who', 'great', 'deal', 'film', 'mourning', 'dreaming', 'about', 'loss', 'beloved', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'brooding', 'dark', 'fairly', 'depressing', 'plot', 'Wolverine', 'recluse', 'living', 'woods', 'happened', 'summoned', 'Japan', 'say', 'goodbye', 'dying', 'old', 'friend', 'saved', 'Nagasaki', 'bombing', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'bit', 'superficial', 'artificial', 'subplot', 'involving', 'friend', 'granddaughter', 'Wolverine', 'kinds', 'mess', 'Yakuza', 'serpent-tongued', 'literally', 'mutant', 'who', 'found', 'way', 'render', 'Wolvering', 'mortal.NOT', 'bad', 'film', 'little', 'substance', 'many', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'characters', 'script', 'needed', 'couple', 'more', 'rewrites', 'unnecessary', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'Wolverine', 'nowhere', 'plus', 'side', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'great', 'visuals', 'pretty', 'wicked', 'final', 'battle', 'ending', 'Will', 'Yun', 'Lee', 'film', 'best', 'asset', 'Jackman', 'Rila', 'Fukushima', 'who', 'totally', 'kick-ass', 'Yukio', 'also', 'fight/chase', 'scene', 'funeral', 'bullet', 'train', 'Fukushima', 'are', 'worth', 'seeing', 'film', 'ALONE']",N/A

The pacing is great, and the film builds to an intense climax.I keep seeing apologies made for the ""lack of action"" - I can only think that the reference is to ""action"" in terms of wild CGI and buildings exploding. Because this film has the best action of any comic book/superhero film that I have ever seen, but much of it is in the form of hand-to-hand combat. The fight choreography is dazzling, and it feels a lot more real than anything in The Avengers. Logan using his claws to duel against combatants with katana swords?

1582279,A26MJME9IBNETY,B0090SI56Y,StrangePegs,"[6, 12]","As it turned out, The Wolverine was much better than I expected it to be, and I actually enjoyed most of it. It has its issues, but, at least, they weren't really bad story-telling issues. The story, amazingly enough, was pretty solid and managed to not go off the cliff that the origin movie did. Of course, the story is only ""pretty solid"" if you look at it within the context of the X-Men movies. This movie has nothing to do with the comics other than that they pull some familiar characters from the Wolverine mythos to use in the movie. If you were hoping for anything resembling an adaptation of the Frank Miller/Chris Claremont Wolverine mini-series from the early '80s, you're not going to find that here. Okay, you'll get something vaguely resembling it. Very vaguely. He does fight some Hand ninjas. Except their not called that. So we're back to that ""vaguely"" again.The thing to know about The Wolverine is that it's not about what it's about it. Within the context of the X-Men movies, the story is here to bridge the gap between X-Men: The Last Stand and the forthcoming X-Men: Days of Future Past and deal with the ramifications of how Last Stand ended. Basically, it's to get Logan to let go of the death of Jean and his part in it. With that goal in mind, The Wolverine actually accomplished its purpose and in a way that made sense. The micro-plot of just this one movie wasn't too bad either, even if it did have more than its share of ""what the heck?"" moments.Spoiler alert:The biggest issue with the movie is the sleight-of-hand they play with Logan's healing power. The dying old guy wants Logan's ability, and the best the writers could come up with is that the old dude is going to ""steal"" it. Not duplicate it, steal it. Which sounds like they're going to do some kind of thing like when Rogue absorbs other mutants' powers, but, no, the old guy is just going to drill into Logan's bone marrow and transfer the power to himself, which doesn't make any sense, but I'll give it a pass on the handwavium principle. Except that they also ""suppress"" his healing power using a little ""Matrix"" bug that gets on Wolvie's heart, and they don't explain that, either, especially after making it seem as if this is some other mutant thing before we find out it's a device. Really, you can only get a pass on one of these things in the movie. The deal with the tiny robot is that they want Wolverine to rip his own heart out to get rid of the thing, so I can see that they're going for the ""cool factor"" with that, but, then, they don't show it, so they lose out on that, anyway. And it leaves all kinds of questions: does the little robot bug suppress all mutant abilities or just Logan's? Or just Logan's healing factor? It's hard to tell, because he really doesn't use any of his heightened senses in the movie at all, so we don't know if he still has those or not. Of course, there's also the argument that Logan's healing power should have just expelled the little robot bug to begin with, but the movie Wolverine isn't quite as powerful as the comic book Wolverine.And neither is adamantium, evidently, because we again have a ""bullet piercing adamantium"" situation in that the old guy cuts off Wolverine's claws to get at his bone marrow. It's slightly more believable than the bullet being fired into Logan's head but not by much.At any rate, those things are just issues with story points not the story itself, and we have to deal with those all the time. Like people surviving explosions by jumping into water or standing behind a wall or whatever. So, whereas there are some... stupid? silly? okay, stupid... things within the story, the plot of The Wolverine holds up both on the level of there being a villain intent upon stealing Logan's healing powers and as a vehicle for Logan to get over have killed Jean.Having said all of that, The Wolverine is not a movie you have to see in the theater. It's not like Pacific Rim or Man of Steel (although I think it's a better movie than both of those) that really need to be seen on the big screen to get the full effect of the scope of the action. You can just as easily wait for the DVD for this one, and, honestly, I doubt there's anything necessary in this movie for the overall X-Men story line. If you like Wolverine, it's probably worth seeing it, but you're not going to feel like you missed anything if you give this one a pass on the way to Days of Future Past.",3,better than expected,1375142400,"07 30, 2013",2013,4441,"['turned', 'out', 'Wolverine', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'expected', 'be', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'issues', 'least', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'bad', 'story-telling', 'issues', 'story', 'amazingly', 'enough', 'was', 'pretty', 'solid', 'managed', 'not', 'go', 'off', 'cliff', 'origin', 'movie', 'did', 'course', 'story', 'only', 'pretty', 'solid', 'look', 'context', 'X-Men', 'movies', 'movie', 'nothing', 'do', 'comics', 'other', 'pull', 'familiar', 'characters', 'Wolverine', 'mythos', 'use', 'movie', 'were', 'hoping', 'anything', 'resembling', 'adaptation', 'Frank', 'Miller/Chris', 'Claremont', 'Wolverine', 'mini-series', 'early', ""'80s"", ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'find', 'here', 'Okay', ""'ll"", 'get', 'something', 'vaguely', 'resembling', 'Very', 'vaguely', 'fight', 'Hand', 'ninjas', 'not', 'called', 'that', ""'re"", 'back', 'vaguely', 'again.The', 'thing', 'know', 'Wolverine', 'not', 'what', 'context', 'X-Men', 'movies', 'story', 'here', 'bridge', 'gap', 'X-Men', 'Last', 'Stand', 'forthcoming', 'X-Men', 'Days', 'Future', 'Past', 'deal', 'ramifications', 'how', 'Last', 'Stand', 'ended', 'Basically', 'get', 'Logan', 'let', 'go', 'death', 'Jean', 'part', 'goal', 'mind', 'Wolverine', 'actually', 'accomplished', 'purpose', 'way', 'made', 'sense', 'micro-plot', 'just', 'one', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'even', 'did', 'have', 'more', 'share', 'what', 'heck', 'moments.Spoiler', 'alert', 'biggest', 'issue', 'movie', 'sleight-of-hand', 'play', 'Logan', 'healing', 'power', 'dying', 'old', 'guy', 'Logan', 'ability', 'best', 'writers', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'old', 'dude', 'going', 'steal', 'Not', 'duplicate', 'steal', 'Which', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', 'kind', 'thing', 'when', 'Rogue', 'other', 'mutants', 'powers', 'old', 'guy', 'just', 'going', 'drill', 'Logan', 'bone', 'marrow', 'transfer', 'power', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', ""'ll"", 'give', 'pass', 'handwavium', 'principle', 'also', 'suppress', 'healing', 'power', 'using', 'little', 'Matrix', 'bug', 'Wolvie', 'heart', 'do', ""n't"", 'explain', 'either', 'especially', 'making', 'seem', 'other', 'mutant', 'thing', 'find', 'out', 'device', 'Really', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'pass', 'one', 'things', 'movie', 'deal', 'tiny', 'robot', 'want', 'Wolverine', 'rip', 'own', 'heart', 'get', 'rid', 'thing', 'can', 'see', ""'re"", 'going', 'cool', 'factor', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'lose', 'out', 'anyway', 'kinds', 'questions', 'little', 'robot', 'bug', 'suppress', 'mutant', 'abilities', 'just', 'Logan', 'just', 'Logan', 'healing', 'factor', 'hard', 'tell', 'really', ""n't"", 'use', 'heightened', 'senses', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'still', 'not', 'course', 'also', 'argument', 'Logan', 'healing', 'power', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'expelled', 'little', 'robot', 'bug', 'begin', 'movie', 'Wolverine', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'powerful', 'comic', 'book', 'Wolverine.And', 'adamantium', 'evidently', 'again', 'have', 'bullet', 'piercing', 'adamantium', 'situation', 'old', 'guy', 'cuts', 'off', 'Wolverine', 'claws', 'get', 'bone', 'marrow', 'slightly', 'more', 'believable', 'bullet', 'being', 'fired', 'Logan', 'head', 'not', 'much.At', 'rate', 'things', 'are', 'just', 'issues', 'story', 'points', 'not', 'story', 'have', 'deal', 'time', 'people', 'surviving', 'explosions', 'jumping', 'water', 'standing', 'wall', 'So', 'are', 'stupid', 'silly', 'okay', 'stupid', 'things', 'story', 'plot', 'Wolverine', 'up', 'level', 'being', 'villain', 'intent', 'stealing', 'Logan', 'healing', 'powers', 'vehicle', 'Logan', 'get', 'over', 'have', 'killed', 'Jean.Having', 'said', 'Wolverine', 'not', 'movie', 'have', 'see', 'theater', 'not', 'like', 'Pacific', 'Rim', 'Man', 'Steel', 'think', 'better', 'movie', 'really', 'need', 'be', 'seen', 'big', 'screen', 'get', 'full', 'effect', 'scope', 'action', 'can', 'just', 'easily', 'wait', 'DVD', 'one', 'honestly', 'doubt', 'anything', 'necessary', 'movie', 'overall', 'X-Men', 'story', 'line', 'like', 'Wolverine', 'probably', 'worth', 'seeing', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'feel', 'missed', 'anything', 'give', 'one', 'pass', 'way', 'Days', 'Future', 'Past']",N/A

I'd say it's worth $1.50 on Redbox.Hugh Jackman's acting was good as always, and some of the action is good, which is why I gave it even 3 stars. But they just weren't enough to carry this movie. The plot, the characters, the lines, the pacing, all just were dull, implausible, and bad. What's frustrating is that some of the secondary characters' acting seems good, but you can't really tell with the boring and occasionally laughable dialogue.You can see the outlines of a good movie here. Wolverine's powers, backstory, and situation make him an ideal character through which to explore immortality, gratitude, altruism, and grief. The opening sequence is tense, scary, touching, and hints at these themes. But then any intelligence or nuance is smothered by one-note, undeveloped characters that are hard to feel anything for, good or bad; unrelenting stereotypes about Japanese culture (where the women are passive; Ninjas hang around everywhere, everyone is a martial arts expert; every house has paper screens); a  chemistry-less romance (Yukio was a much more interesting female character); overlong action and violence sequences for their own sake; silly villains with no apparent motives; and huge plot holes (for example, exactly why was the whole funeral/will thing even in there? why not just take what he wanted from Wolverine to begin with if the technology was available? why did Harada suddenly change his viewpoint, and how did Viper get him to go along with this stupid plan? why does Wolverine even stay in Japan more than 1 day, and what makes him suddenly risk everything for Mariko?) Basically, the plot hinges on us caring whether (a) Mariko, the main female charater, lives or dies and she's so vanilla and helpless that you can't and (b) caring that the rightful person ends up heading up the company. You can see that one or more writers/directors/producers cared about this film.

Great fight scenes as always with this character, interesting ""dealing with loss of powers"" twist, the Tokyo sets look amazing and absolutely loved the train sequence.  Unfortunately, the pacing of the film starts out slow.... way too slow and by the time it picks up we're given kinda same-`ole that we see in the majority of action films with some painfully disappointing villains and the Jean Grey dream sequences were not only pointless but that character, as portrayed in the films, just makes my skin crawl.I think two decidedly mediocre Wolverine films in a row demonstrate that it's either time for a team-up or a great versus and I personally believe that Jackman could easily continue to portray this character for at least another decade (thank goodness he regenerates).  :o)",3,Jean Grey is Gone but not Forgotten...

1582301,A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B0090SI56Y,"THowerton ""SHowT""","[1, 4]","""The Wolverine"" is almost as far from ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" as it could get considering that it involves Marvel's iconic and not-so-merry mutant with the beyond impressive healing factor and Adamantium-laced skeleton.  While the first movie did a great job with some elements (the opening/ title sequence giving you a snapshot history of Wolvie for instance) it did try to cram a lot into its origin story while still fitting into the Marvel cinematic universe and providing a lot of fan service (his duel with Deadpool? overkill).  By contrast ""The Wolverine"" feels almost unnaturally grounded; it's a drama with a specifically Japanese ethos that flits some brief action sequences in and out of it until the last 15 or so minutes of the movie when it feels like an actual comic book/ superhero movie.  And it aint half bad, bub.Directed by James Mangold (""Walk the Line""; ""Knight and Day""; ""3:10 To Yuma""), who has worked with the Wolverine himself previously in an off-kilter and pleasing romantic comedy (""Kate & Leopold"", pretty good, you should check it out), ""The Wolverine"" doesn't bother to try to follow right after the ""Origins"" movie.  Instead this movie takes up a little while after the events of ""X-Men 3: The Last Stand"" with Logan (Wolverine for those who don't know) living up in the northern wilderness suffering nightmares/ waking visions of Jean Grey.  He's checked out of the superhero and X-Men business and has taken a vow essentially not to kill.  But his less-than-idyllic living is interrupted by a young small Japanese woman who is handy with a sword (comic fans may notice that what they have done with this character is make her similar, in ways, to a certain Jubilation Lee...).  She draws him to Japan to say goodbye to a former Japanese soldier that he had saved in WWII.  From here Logan is drawn into the lives of Yukio (the sword girl) and Mariko (the granddaughter of the soldier whom he had saved previously).  Logan falls in love (I'm not telling you with whom...but could it be both?) and through this lapse into love and his following actions to save her/ them from the family's internal politics regains his desire to live, and to fight again.  All of this occurs in Japan and the Japanese setting and actors provide a genuine feel for their culture and, while the film doesn't try to get deep into it, allows their culture's historical ideal of death before dishonor to be held up within several of the characters meaning that this is frequently their main motivations to take action.  This lends the film an almost mysterious feel.  It isn't a film that will make you leave the theater pumping your fist and yelling ""YEAH!"" nor is it a film that will make you shrug your shoulders and ask ""is that it?""  It is a film that will linger, quietly and a bit unexpectedly, with you so that you don't mind returning to it some time in the near future.The action sequences aren't overpowering.  This is bound to disappoint some fans; the tradeoff was that Mangold created a more emotionally compelling Wolverine.  Also, effort was made to provide a storyline in which Wolverine is stripped of his healing factor and thus made physically vulnerable (we know he's emotionally vulnerable as he's oft portrayed as emotionally damaged goods) in a non-sensational manner that actually makes some sense.  By doing this Mangold and the writers were able to raise the emotional stakes for this unbeatable character.  And, I must say, there were three genuinely surprising moments in this film for me where I could hardly believe what they did; completely unexpected.  My main qualms were how they ended the film; Wolverine should have said more to his love.  I also wish that they would have had Wolverine study the Samurai's way (as he did in the comics that they based this storyline off of) and played up the Ronin (leaderless Samurai) angle more.  They played around these edges but never went into this particular box.Be sure to watch for the teaser during the closing credits.My closing thoughts are that this is a good movie, enjoyable and with some emotional weight, one that won't overwhelm the viewer by any stretch of the imagination but that will likely linger quietly with the (adult) viewer awhile afterward.  Fans or moviegoers looking for an action-packed hack-'n-slash superhero film have another thing coming and they may feel disappointed.Four out of five Snikts!",4,The Wolverine and his woman troubles.,1375228800,"07 31, 2013",2013,4414,"['Wolverine', 'almost', 'far', 'X-Men', 'Origins', 'Wolverine', 'could', 'get', 'considering', 'Marvel', 'iconic', 'not-so-merry', 'mutant', 'impressive', 'healing', 'factor', 'Adamantium-laced', 'skeleton', 'first', 'movie', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'elements', 'opening/', 'title', 'sequence', 'giving', 'snapshot', 'history', 'Wolvie', 'instance', 'did', 'try', 'cram', 'lot', 'origin', 'story', 'still', 'fitting', 'Marvel', 'cinematic', 'universe', 'providing', 'lot', 'fan', 'service', 'duel', 'Deadpool', 'overkill', 'contrast', 'Wolverine', 'almost', 'unnaturally', 'grounded', 'drama', 'specifically', 'Japanese', 'ethos', 'brief', 'action', 'sequences', 'last', '15', 'so', 'minutes', 'movie', 'when', 'actual', 'comic', 'book/', 'superhero', 'movie', 'half', 'bad', 'bub.Directed', 'James', 'Mangold', 'Walk', 'Line', 'Knight', 'Day', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'who', 'worked', 'Wolverine', 'previously', 'off-kilter', 'pleasing', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Kate', 'Leopold', 'pretty', 'good', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'Wolverine', ""n't"", 'bother', 'try', 'follow', 'right', 'Origins', 'movie', 'Instead', 'movie', 'up', 'little', 'while', 'events', 'X-Men', '3', 'Last', 'Stand', 'Logan', 'Wolverine', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'living', 'up', 'northern', 'wilderness', 'suffering', 'nightmares/', 'waking', 'visions', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'checked', 'superhero', 'X-Men', 'business', 'taken', 'vow', 'essentially', 'not', 'kill', 'less-than-idyllic', 'living', 'interrupted', 'young', 'small', 'Japanese', 'woman', 'who', 'handy', 'sword', 'comic', 'fans', 'may', 'notice', 'what', 'have', 'done', 'character', 'make', 'similar', 'ways', 'certain', 'Jubilation', 'Lee', 'Japan', 'say', 'goodbye', 'former', 'Japanese', 'soldier', 'had', 'saved', 'WWII', 'here', 'Logan', 'drawn', 'lives', 'Yukio', 'sword', 'girl', 'Mariko', 'granddaughter', 'soldier', 'whom', 'had', 'saved', 'previously', 'Logan', 'love', ""'m"", 'not', 'telling', 'whom', 'could', 'be', 'lapse', 'love', 'following', 'actions', 'save', 'her/', 'family', 'internal', 'politics', 'desire', 'live', 'fight', 'again', 'occurs', 'Japan', 'Japanese', 'setting', 'actors', 'provide', 'genuine', 'feel', 'culture', 'film', ""n't"", 'try', 'get', 'deep', 'culture', 'historical', 'ideal', 'death', 'dishonor', 'be', 'held', 'up', 'several', 'characters', 'meaning', 'frequently', 'main', 'motivations', 'take', 'action', 'film', 'almost', 'mysterious', 'feel', ""n't"", 'film', 'will', 'make', 'leave', 'theater', 'pumping', 'fist', 'yelling', 'YEAH', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'shrug', 'shoulders', 'ask', 'film', 'will', 'linger', 'quietly', 'bit', 'unexpectedly', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'returning', 'time', 'near', 'future.The', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', ""n't"", 'overpowering', 'bound', 'disappoint', 'fans', 'tradeoff', 'was', 'Mangold', 'created', 'more', 'emotionally', 'compelling', 'Wolverine', 'Also', 'effort', 'was', 'made', 'provide', 'storyline', 'Wolverine', 'stripped', 'healing', 'factor', 'thus', 'made', 'physically', 'vulnerable', 'know', 'emotionally', 'vulnerable', 'oft', 'portrayed', 'emotionally', 'damaged', 'goods', 'non-sensational', 'manner', 'actually', 'sense', 'doing', 'Mangold', 'writers', 'were', 'able', 'raise', 'emotional', 'stakes', 'unbeatable', 'character', 'must', 'say', 'were', 'three', 'genuinely', 'surprising', 'moments', 'film', 'where', 'could', 'hardly', 'believe', 'what', 'did', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'main', 'qualms', 'were', 'how', 'ended', 'film', 'Wolverine', 'should', 'have', 'said', 'more', 'love', 'also', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'Wolverine', 'study', 'Samurai', 'way', 'did', 'comics', 'based', 'storyline', 'played', 'up', 'Ronin', 'leaderless', 'Samurai', 'more', 'played', 'edges', 'never', 'went', 'particular', 'box.Be', 'sure', 'watch', 'teaser', 'closing', 'credits.My', 'closing', 'thoughts', 'are', 'good', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'emotional', 'weight', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'overwhelm', 'viewer', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'will', 'likely', 'linger', 'quietly', 'adult', 'viewer', 'afterward', 'Fans', 'moviegoers', 'looking', 'action-packed', 'hack-', 'n-slash', 'superhero', 'film', 'have', 'thing', 'coming', 'may', 'feel', 'disappointed.Four', 'five', 'Snikts']",N/A

1582312,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0090SI56Y,Tsuyoshi,"[7, 11]","""The Wolverine"" (2013) is the sixth ""X-Men"" film since Bryan Singer directed the first one in 2000, and the second film featuring Hugh Jackman's popular hero without the rest of the ""X-Men"" characters. (Actually, some of them return to the series, but about that, later.) What distinguishes the new installment from others is the exotic location of Japan, against which our reluctant hero has to have his own adventure.Unfortunately, Logan / Wolverine's new adventure - written by Mark Bomback and Scott Frank, and directed by James Mangold - is not that exciting. Wolverine is summoned by an old acquaintance, Japanese soldier Mr. Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi) he once saved in Nagasaki during WWII. Yashida, now head of a big company, knows he is dying, and offers something unusual to Wolverine, who is ""cursed"" by immortality.James Mangold did an acceptable job as director, though action scenes lack the style.  As a drama ""The Wolverine"" is unfocused because of its convoluted story and unconvincing motives of some characters. Some locations are effectively used, including the beautiful seaside district of Tomonoura, Fukuyama city, which stands in for Nagasaki, though the ""Japan"" here is a highly exaggerated one, something you will find only in Hollywood movies.And that is fine with me, as long as characters are interesting. Some of the Marvel Comics characters (re-)appear in the film - Yashida's son Shingen (Hiroyuki Sanada, wasted), his daughter and Wolverine's love interest Mariko (Tao Okamoto), a female ninja Yukio (Rila Fukushima), Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) and Silver Samurai, as well as Jean Grey (Famke Janssen reprising the role) and two other familiar faces who should remain unnamed here - but none of them is really interesting with an exception of agile Yukio.Thanks to Hugh Jackman (and his on-screen charisma and evident acting skills), ""The Wolverine"" is not boring. Action is entertaining but not inspired, and the film needs better characters and story.",3,Hugh Jackman as Wolverine  Is Great as Ever But Story Needs Improvement,1381708800,"10 14, 2013",2013,1992,"['Wolverine', '2013', 'sixth', 'X-Men', 'film', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'directed', 'first', 'one', '2000', 'second', 'film', 'featuring', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'popular', 'hero', 'rest', 'X-Men', 'characters', 'Actually', 'return', 'series', 'later', 'What', 'new', 'installment', 'others', 'exotic', 'location', 'Japan', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'have', 'own', 'adventure.Unfortunately', 'Logan', '/', 'Wolverine', 'new', 'adventure', 'written', 'Mark', 'Bomback', 'Scott', 'Frank', 'directed', 'James', 'Mangold', 'not', 'exciting', 'Wolverine', 'summoned', 'old', 'acquaintance', 'Japanese', 'soldier', 'Mr.', 'Yashida', 'Haruhiko', 'Yamanouchi', 'once', 'saved', 'Nagasaki', 'WWII', 'Yashida', 'now', 'head', 'big', 'company', 'dying', 'something', 'unusual', 'Wolverine', 'who', 'cursed', 'immortality.James', 'Mangold', 'did', 'acceptable', 'job', 'director', 'action', 'scenes', 'lack', 'style', 'drama', 'Wolverine', 'unfocused', 'convoluted', 'story', 'unconvincing', 'motives', 'characters', 'locations', 'are', 'effectively', 'used', 'including', 'beautiful', 'seaside', 'district', 'Tomonoura', 'Fukuyama', 'city', 'Nagasaki', 'Japan', 'here', 'highly', 'exaggerated', 'one', 'something', 'will', 'find', 'only', 'Hollywood', 'movies.And', 'fine', 'as', 'long', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'characters', 're-', 'appear', 'film', 'Yashida', 'son', 'Shingen', 'Hiroyuki', 'Sanada', 'wasted', 'daughter', 'Wolverine', 'love', 'interest', 'Mariko', 'Tao', 'Okamoto', 'female', 'ninja', 'Yukio', 'Rila', 'Fukushima', 'Viper', 'Svetlana', 'Khodchenkova', 'Silver', 'Samurai', 'as', 'well', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'reprising', 'role', 'two', 'other', 'familiar', 'who', 'should', 'remain', 'unnamed', 'here', 'none', 'really', 'interesting', 'exception', 'agile', 'Yukio.Thanks', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'on-screen', 'charisma', 'evident', 'acting', 'skills', 'Wolverine', 'not', 'boring', 'Action', 'entertaining', 'not', 'inspired', 'film', 'better', 'characters', 'story']",N/A

Another mutant infects Wolverine and he starts to lose his ability to heal and is weakened. He has to have a Japanese girl defend him. He regains his ability to heal only to get his metal claws chopped off in battle. The Wolverine got his butt kicked and declawed by a man with a robotic exoskeleton. Another Japanese gal had to save him by using one of his chopped off claws. Now, with his tail tucked between his legs, he goes to the airport to leave Japan where Magneto and the Professor stop time and give him an urgent message the world is about to be destroyed.It seems to be a trend in superhero movies to make the superhero impotent the majority of the movie then after having watched your superhero get his butt kicked for over an hour, they finally muster enough strength for a brief comeback.  Well, this movie not only follows the horribly overdone trend but goes a step further.

Wolverine had saved the life of Yashida when he was a soldier during the atomic bombing of Nagasaki. The event provided a bond between the POW and soldier and Yashida wants to repay his debt--the dying industrialist claims to have a cure to Wolverine's cure--his immortality. Wolverine turns Yashida down and the old man dies that night. During the funeral Wolverine finds himself a reluctant bodyguard for Yashida's young granddaughter Mariko when someone makes an attempt on her life. Wolverine is determined to find out what the link is between Yashida's past, his death and Mariko.END OF SPOILERS:The 3D (and 2D) presentation on Blu-ray for ""The Wolverine"" looks marvelous with nice depth, bold colors and great detail. The film is presented with a nice layer of grain adding to the film like texture.The immersive 5.1 sounds terrific as well although some folks might have difficulty with dialog during a few scenes due to how the folded down 5.1 track sounds in stereo.I should note, however, that ""The Wolverine"" doesn't suffer from extremely aggressive mix that made ""Man of Steel"" problematic at times. English subtitles are available for the film.The 3D edition features 4 discs.The first disc includes the 3D version of the movie with no bonus features. Again, this does NOT feature the extended version of the film.The second disc features the theatrical cut of ""The Wolverine"" along with the bulk of the bonus features that are included on the standard 2 disc Blu-ray/DVD combo pack. We get an alternate ending along with a tour of the set for ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"". We also get ""The Wolverine: Second Screen App for use with ipads and other portable devices. The three part documentary ""The Pathof a Ronin"" is also included on this disc as well as a profile of actor Hugh Jackman and a featurette on the evolution of the character of Wolverine.The third disc features the EXTENDED CUT of the movie. The bonus features include a second screen app exclusive to this version and a commentary track by director James Mangold. Mangold does not do a commentary track on the theatrical cut of the film on the second disc. The extended version lasts about 12 minutes long than the theatrical cut of the film.The fourth disc includes only the DVD transfer of the film along with a digital copy that can be uploaded and played on portable devices and computers.Fox should have provided an extended version on 3D (they could have done a seamlessly branching version of both films on the same disc). They also should have provided the extended version for the regular Blu-ray version for those who don't have 3D TVs. It would have been the right thing to do.""The Wolverine"" is a marvelous film that has a much darker edge than ""Origins: Wolverine"" and is a better written film with a much healthier budget allowing Mangold to tackle much more involved CGI for the film.

1582330,A3SO4SZPDNW0S3,B0090SI56Y,William Krischke,"[2, 9]","We like Wolverine. Apparently we really like him; ""The Wolverine"" is the sixth movie in which Hugh Jackman's played the character, which was created in 1974 by Len Wein and John Romita, Sr. (He was originally an enemy of the Hulk.) To understand why we like him so much, I think it's helpful to think back to 1974. America had just lost the war in Vietnam, thanks to the politicians despite winning all the battles (whether or not this is factually true, it was the general zeitgeist of the time.) We'd just found out our President was a crook, and forced him to resign. A lot of Americans had a lot of rage, a problem with authority, a hard time trusting anybody, but also a deep thirst for justice and revenge. We'd stopped believing the system was ever going to deliver it for us, and were ready to get it any way possible. We felt powerful, cheated, and pissed, and somebody needed to pay.As Wolverine's popularity skyrocketed in the comic books, Clint Eastwood became one of the most popular stars in Hollywood playing a brooding cop with a big gun who always got the bad guy but had a hard time playing by the rules. There's a lot of Dirty Harry in Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine, and I'm still waiting for the movie that introduces Eastwood as Logan's long lost father.""The Wolverine"" picks up where ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" left off, which is a bit of a stumble, because that movie was made 7 years ago and there have been two X-Men films since then. It took me a while to recapture the storyline: Logan killed Jean Grey, the woman he loved, because her alternate personality the Phoenix, was taking over and destroying everyone and everything around her.Wolverine has fled to somewhere very wooded and become Grizzly Adams. He is haunted by dreams of Jean Grey, and promises never to hurt anyone again ever, a promise he keeps for about five minutes, until someone hurts one of his ursine friends. While he is beating up rednecks, a pink-haired Japanese ninja girl (Rila Fukushima) finds him and begs him to come to Tokyo, where a man he once saved is dying, and wants to say goodbye.Logan agrees, and somehow never suspects that the man he is going to see-- billionaire tech giant Yashida, played by Haruhiko Yamanouchi -- might have an ulterior motive for bringing him across the ocean. Logan gets embroiled in a complicated, nearly incoherent family controversy, wherein the Yakuza are trying to assassinate the old man's granddaughter, except maybe they're hired by the pretty girl's father, who's mad that he's not mentioned in the old man's will, except maybe not, because there's also a playboy fianc&eacute;e with political ambitions and a jilted boyfriend with lots of ninja friends, and maybe the old man's not quite as dead as he appears.I don't know if it all makes sense. I don't feel like wasting the brainpower it would take to untangle it all and see if it makes sense. What it all boils down to is that Logan is going to protect the pretty granddaughter (Tao Okamota) because she's pretty and vulnerable and likes to kiss him. And a lot of people want to kill her, some with guns and some with swords and some with poison-tipped arrows, and it's not all that important who sent them, or why.""The Wolverine's"" convoluted plot, as well as an airless, joyless third act where everything is explained but nothing makes sense, are the film's weaknesses. But it has plenty of strengths. The film is strong on atmosphere and aesthetics, and director James Mangold knows how to make the most of his Japanese settings. It's packed to the brim with exciting action sequences, including one aboard a bullet train sequence bears more than a passing resemblance to the space suit action sequence in ""Star Trek: Into Darkness."" I don't say that to disrespect it; these two are probably the best two action sequences in movies this summer.This is as much a samurai film as a superhero film, and that's pretty cool. Svetlana Khodchenkova has a lot of fun playing sexy villainess Viper, who likes to wear green, scaly tight-fitting things and kills people by kissing them with her acidic, forked tongue. She's not really given enough to do and her death is anticlimactic, but the Russian actress makes the most of what the script and the screen time give her.Also, she has the unexplained ability to take away Wolverine's healing factor, rendering him killable. The script makes the most of this, and Jackman's meets them halfway; the result is a protagonist who isn't invulnerable (like Superman and Thor,) but seems genuinely surprised by how much being hurt, well, hurts. Logan briefly contemplates letting himself be killed, so that he can join Jean Grey (and the countless other people he's watched die over his 200-year lifespan) in the afterlife. But there's the ing&eacute;nue to save from the bad guys. Sigh... seems like there's always an ing&eacute;nue to save from the bad guys. Superheroes never get a chance to spend quality time with their loved ones, dead or alive. It's a tough life.I wonder if, as an audience, we'll ever grow tired of Wolverine. 1974 was a long time ago, and it's been a while since we nearly impeached a president or lost a war. I suppose there's always plenty to be angry about, but successful, entertaining and even humorous movies featuring more brightly colored, optimistic superheroes - guys like Iron Man, Thor and Captain America - make me think the age of the dark, angsty protagonist may finally be coming to an end. There's another X-Men movie in the works (make sure to stick through the credits to see the teaser for ""Days of Future Past"") but maybe after that, Jackman can hang up the claws once and for all. I've enjoyed the Wolverine movies -- most of them -- but don't really feel like I need any more of them.",3,Here He Comes Again...,1376352000,"08 13, 2013",2013,5773,"['like', 'Wolverine',

I really enjoyed &#34;The Wolverine&#34; though, and if there's one real flaw to this movie, it's just that there wasn't a particular need to make it.  This is a great one-off story about The Wolverine.  It takes place after the events of the third X-Men movie (&#34;X-Men III:  The Last Stand&#34;) and in some ways this story attempts to address some of the issues with that movie, filling in bits that legitimize some of the unpleasant tragedies that for some fans really marred that film.The Wolverine has some really great moments.  It starts with an interesting backstory set during World War II and as it brings the story forward to modern day, Logan has a chance to explore his own needs.  He questions what it means to go on living, and he examines the things that have happened in the past.  I'm reluctant to spoil this story too much for you, so I'll focus on some of the basics:- it has some fantastic martial arts sequences- it has one of the best 'top of a train' fight scenes I've ever seen--a sequence that reminds me of the excitement of the highway battle in the second Matrix movie because it gives a couple of nods to that scene.- our hero has the proverbial rug pulled out from under him:  he isn't as strong as he usually is, there is a lot more real danger for him, and because the movie takes place almost entirely in Japan, he's in unfamiliar territory- Hugh Jackman pulled out all the stops in trying to give Logan emotional depth while still keeping his character the warrior that he is--we get some great acting in this film, particularly at the very beginning and very end.This review is for the 3D Blu-Ray though, so I have to take a moment to say that this is a pretty full package.  I like the fact that we get both the original and Extended editions.  The 3D aspect is a lot more mature:  the movie doesn't use 3D to see how many things it can throw at your eyes.  Instead it tries to paint a three-dimensional world.  I watched this on my Vizio 47&#34; 3D HDTV in 1080p and loved the feel of it:  the 3D look made my TV more like a window with the action inside of it.If you haven't seen this movie yet because one of the previous films disappointed you, I think you'll be pleased with the improvement here.  If I had to compare &#34;The Wolverine&#34; to &#34;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&#34;, I'd say I'm much happier to have this movie than that one, and glad I paid a bit extra for the Extended Edition.

1582338,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B0090SI56Y,Wuchak,"[0, 3]","""The Wolverine"" (2013) takes place after ""X-Men: The Last Stand (Widescreen Edition)"" (2006) and focuses on Logan in Japan. It's reminiscent of Chris Claremont & Frank Miller's original 1982 4-part Wolverine miniseries.Like that miniseries, the film is very atypical for comic book superheroes. It plays out more like a James Bond flick, sort of a modern version of ""You Only Live Twice"", than a conventional superhero flick. Logan (Hugh Jackman) never appears in an outlandish costume, nor do any other characters, except Viper, and hers isn't all that outlandish.The beginning is great -- the World War II prologue and the Yukon sequences. I also enjoyed the Japanese locations and culture, as well as the focus on drama mixed with stellar bouts of comic book action. Unfortunately, I found the story only moderately interesting, which is the main reason I rate the film as mediocre as I do. It just isn't all that captivating.I really liked the character of Yukio (Rila Fukushima), and Hiroyuki Sanada makes a quality antagonist, but I found Mariko (Tao Okamoto) and Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) rather bland. The Silver Samurai also appears in an armored suit a la Iron Man or War Machine and comes across as typical for this type of fare.In addition, Famke Janssen appears as Jean Grey. She's fine in the role, but she never tripped my trigger. The best lookin' woman in the entire film, believe it or not, is the cashier who talks to Logan briefly in Yukon.I'll be honest with you, I thought 2009's ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" was better than this one. Despite the cartoony opening, it had more depth and was way more compelling. Still, ""The Wolverine"" is a solid depiction of Wolverine's adventures in Japan.The film runs 2 hours and 6 minutes.GRADE: C+ or B-",3,Atypical superhero movie,1376092800,"08 10, 2013",2013,1766,"['Wolverine', '2013', 'place', 'X-Men', 'Last', 'Stand', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', '2006', 'Logan', 'Japan', 'reminiscent', 'Chris', 'Claremont', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'original', '1982', '4-part', 'Wolverine', 'miniseries.Like', 'film', 'very', 'atypical', 'comic', 'book', 'superheroes', 'out', 'more', 'James', 'Bond', 'flick', 'sort', 'modern', 'version', 'Only', 'Live', 'Twice', 'conventional', 'superhero', 'flick', 'Logan', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'never', 'outlandish', 'costume', 'do', 'other', 'characters', 'Viper', 'hers', ""n't"", 'outlandish.The', 'beginning', 'great', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'prologue', 'Yukon', 'sequences', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Japanese', 'locations', 'culture', 'as', 'well', 'focus', 'drama', 'mixed', 'stellar', 'bouts', 'comic', 'book', 'action', 'Unfortunately', 'found', 'story', 'only', 'moderately', 'interesting', 'main', 'reason', 'rate', 'film', 'as', 'mediocre', 'do', 'just', ""n't"", 'captivating.I', 'really', 'liked', 'character', 'Yukio', 'Rila', 'Fukushima', 'Hiroyuki', 'Sanada', 'quality', 'antagonist', 'found', 'Mariko', 'Tao', 'Okamoto', 'Viper', 'Svetlana', 'Khodchenkova', 'rather', 'bland', 'Silver', 'Samurai', 'also', 'armored', 'suit', 'la', 'Iron', 'Man', 'War', 'Machine', 'across', 'typical', 'type', 'fare.In', 'addition', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'fine', 'role', 'never', 'tripped', 'trigger', 'best', 'lookin', 'woman', 'entire', 'film', 'believe', 'not', 'cashier', 'who', 'Logan', 'briefly', 'Yukon.I', ""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'thought', '2009', 'X-Men', 'Origins', 'Wolverine', 'was', 'better', 'one', 'cartoony', 'opening', 'had', 'more', 'depth', 'was', 'way', 'more', 'compelling', 'Still', 'Wolverine', 'solid', 'depiction', 'Wolverine', 'adventures', 'Japan.The', 'film', '2', 'hours', '6', 'minutes.GRADE', 'C+', 'B-']",N/A

There are more than a few scenes in this movie that are worth rewinding and re-watching.  It's that well done.  This movie is more adult, as it should be; and puts Wolverine into quite a few bad places.  We get to see why he is a true hero.  It's not his healing factor.  It's not his claws.  Because Wolverine loses his powers for a while and still prevails through a series of suspenseful scenes that make you admire him for WHO he is, not for what his mutant abilities or adamantium upgrades are.The Silver Samurai is not like the comics version, but it is still pretty scary.  He's all adamantium!  You can guess how that makes things on Wolverine.The acting is perfect.  Jackman brings Wolverine to life.  The effects are stunning.

When I saw this movie in the theaters, I walked away a little disappointed.  It didn't live up to my expectations like I was hoping.  The bullet train scene was very cool, all scenes with Hugh shirtless, and the very memorable 'bathtub scene' made me smile, but there were a lot of scenes I was like, &#34;c'mon really?&#34; Or &#34;give me a break!&#34;  I wasn't really happy with the acting from the women.  To me, it seems a bit &#34;amateur-ish.&#34;  The scene with the &#34;silver samuri&#34; was really lame.  The very end during the credits got me looking forward to &#34;Days of Future Past!&#34;  Maybe because this was a &#34;Stand alone,&#34; movie that made me dislike it.  My nephew was with me when we saw it, and on our way home, he said he liked &#34;the one where he was a lumberjack (x-men Origins).&#34;  I did too!  Out of all of them, that was my favorite!  I bought this hoping if I saw it again, it would change my opinion.
