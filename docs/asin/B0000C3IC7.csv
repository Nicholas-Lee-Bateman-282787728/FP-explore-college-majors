It actually took me many months after buying to get around to seeing and it was way better than I thought. Avoid it if you're not at all into lower-budget 'B'-movies.But if you don't need absolute perfection and like a good who-was-framed-for-murder film noir whodunit, then this is pretty good! I thought Bret Michaels was excellent for a starring debut. Yes don't expect to see much of Martin Sheen and even less of Charlie, but don't worry. Problem is it may be a hard dvd to find. :(There's a surprise ending but I won't tell you or you'll start to expect it.

773461,A2KYQAKDQJSFIR,B0000C3IC7,EnchantedHeart,"[0, 2]","As a long time Poison fan, this two-star rating pains me. Especially since one of the stars is for the amount of time Bret spent with his shirt off. Very nice. Anyway, the other star is for the somewhat interesting story. With the amount of time it took Bret to finish this movie (I remember hearing about it back in the late 80's), you'd think he would have done a minimal amount of legal research? A lot of this is just poorly researched nonsense. Like a story written by a kid in junior high who has no access to books or the internet, and just imagines what it must be like to be on death row. The movie attempts a Big Twist! at the end, but really didn't make any sense. I managed to watch it all the way through, so I guess it wasn't that bad. Except for the Sheens, the acting is just as bad as you suspect.",2,God Bless Bret's Greedy Little Soul and Washboard Abs,1203724800,"02 23, 2008",2008,814,"['long', 'time', 'Poison', 'fan', 'two-star', 'rating', 'pains', 'Especially', 'one', 'stars', 'amount', 'time', 'Bret', 'spent', 'shirt', 'off', 'Very', 'nice', 'Anyway', 'other', 'star', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'story', 'amount', 'time', 'took', 'Bret', 'finish', 'movie', 'remember', 'hearing', 'back', 'late', '80', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'minimal', 'amount', 'legal', 'research', 'lot', 'just', 'poorly', 'researched', 'nonsense', 'story', 'written', 'kid', 'junior', 'high', 'who', 'access', 'books', 'internet', 'just', 'imagines', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'be', 'death', 'row', 'movie', 'Big', 'Twist', 'end', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'managed', 'watch', 'way', 'guess', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Sheens', 'acting', 'just', 'as', 'bad', 'suspect']",N/A
773462,A3PE884TA8529G,B0000C3IC7,J. E. Nelson,"[8, 9]","As a fan of Poison and Bret Michaels, I purchased a copy of this DVD, without knowing much about the movie.  I found the movie to be slow starting, but quite suspenseful as the movie progressed.  This movie is basically a one-man show.  Bret Michaels wrote the movie script, co-directed, wrote and performed the music, produced, edited, and starred in this movie.The movie is a suspense thriller about a convicted felon named Michael Raine, played by Bret Michaels.  Raine is accused and convicted of killing his ""exotic dancer"" girlfriend.  For his alleged actions, Raine is sentenced to death by electrocution.  Despite the alleged murder being video taped, throughout his trial and while in prison, Raine asserts his innocence, contending the tape was nothing more than promiscuous role-play.  A conspiracy begins to unravel as Raine finds out his girlfriend was actually ""friendly"" with some high ranking people, some of which would protect their names at all cost.The storyline in this movie is decent, yet slightly predictable.  For the people who like to try and guess how a suspense thriller will end, the opening line of the movie is vital.  The acting in the movie is a little weak.  Despite Martin Sheen and Charlie Sheen being listed on the front cover as actors, they probably only have 2 or 3 minutes of screen time between the two of them.  The filmography in the movie does appear to be ""cheap"" at times (the murder scene reminded me of a horrifically amateur adult film, but that is just my opinion) as well as the opening credits seem to look unnatural like something some students would put together for a high school film class.Putting the negative aspects aside, overall this was a great suspense thriller.  This is a movie that I would recommend renting if possible or buying it used.  I have not watched it twice, but I do not think it would be as good the second time.  Keep in mind, the movie seems to be a cheap production, so don't expect extravagant special effects or high quality acting, but all in all it was an enjoyable movie to watch.  I was impressed that a singer like Bret Michaels could cross over into film and put together a movie that was quite enjoyable.",4,"Decent Storyline, Lackluster Acting",1117152000,"05 27, 2005",2005,2196,"['fan', 'Poison', 'Bret', 'Michaels', 'purchased', 'copy', 'DVD', 'knowing', 'much', 'movie', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'slow', 'starting', 'quite', 'suspenseful', 'movie', 'progressed', 'movie', 'basically', 'one-man', 'show', 'Bret', 'Michaels', 'wrote', 'movie', 'script', 'co-directed', 'wrote', 'performed', 'music', 'produced', 'edited', 'starred', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'convicted', 'felon', 'named', 'Michael', 'Raine', 'played', 'Bret', 'Michaels', 'Raine', 'accused', 'convicted', 'killing', 'exotic', 'dancer', 'girlfriend', 'alleged', 'actions', 'Raine', 'sentenced', 'death', 'electrocution', 'alleged', 'murder', 'being', 'video', 'taped', 'trial', 'prison', 'Raine', 'innocence', 'contending', 'tape', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'promiscuous', 'role-play', 'conspiracy', 'unravel', 'Raine', 'out', 'girlfriend', 'was', 'actually', 'friendly', 'high', 'ranking', 'people', 'would', 'protect', 'names', 'cost.The', 'storyline', 'movie', 'decent', 'yet', 'slightly', 'predictable', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'try', 'guess', 'how', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'will', 'end', 'opening', 'line', 'movie', 'vital', 'acting', 'movie', 'little', 'weak', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'being', 'listed', 'front', 'cover', 'actors', 'probably', 'only', 'have', '2', '3', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'two', 'filmography', 'movie', 'appear', 'be', 'cheap', 'times', 'murder', 'scene', 'reminded', 'horrifically', 'amateur', 'adult', 'film', 'just', 'opinion', 'as', 'well', 'opening', 'credits', 'seem', 'look', 'unnatural', 'something', 'students', 'would', 'put', 'together', 'high', 'school', 'film', 'class.Putting', 'negative', 'aspects', 'aside', 'overall', 'was', 'great', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'renting', 'possible', 'buying', 'used', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'twice', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'second', 'time', 'Keep', 'mind', 'movie', 'be', 'cheap', 'production', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'extravagant', 'special', 'effects', 'high', 'quality', 'acting', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'watch', 'was', 'impressed', 'singer', 'Bret', 'Michaels', 'could', 'cross', 'over', 'film', 'put', 'together', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'enjoyable']",N/A
773463,A2EBLL2OYEQJN9,B0000C3IC7,Jessica Lux,"[2, 5]","This movie is universally mocked.  I own the soundtrack and it is pretty darn bad, but I had to see the movie for myself.  Other universally accepted facts are that Bret Michaels is hot, Poison made some great music in the 1980's, and their music videos were darn good and the DVD collection of them sells well to their fan base even a full two decades later.Bret should stick to his talents at over-the-top rock music and music videos.  This movie is shot like a music video, circa 1988, with weird effects and fades that are inappropriate for a drama.  As a rock star Bret is a good guy with a bad boy image, and he tries to pull that off with the main character in this movie as a petty criminal who is framed for murder.  It's laughable how he tries to tip toe the good guy/criminal line, and he fails at being either.  There's a massive conspiracy twist and Bret's character is not just fighting for his own life, but justice for the entire community at the hand of corrupt politicians.The acting is bad, the plot is predictably bad, the soundtrack is rotten, and Bret's own hero worship for himself is shameless.  You know what?  For any Poison fan, this crosses the line from bad to so-bad-its-good.  Don't waste your money on it, but rent it for a single viewing.",2,"Bad, but you might just find it so bad it is good",1153526400,"07 22, 2006",2006,1271,"['movie', 'universally', 'mocked', 'own', 'soundtrack', 'pretty', 'darn', 'bad', 'had', 'see', 'movie', 'Other', 'universally', 'accepted', 'facts', 'are', 'Bret', 'Michaels', 'hot', 'Poison', 'made', 'great', 'music', '1980', 'music', 'videos', 'were', 'darn', 'good', 'DVD', 'collection', 'well', 'fan', 'base', 'even', 'full', 'two', 'decades', 'later.Bret', 'should', 'stick', 'talents', 'over-the-top', 'rock', 'music', 'music', 'videos', 'movie', 'shot', 'music', 'video', 'circa', '1988', 'weird', 'effects', 'fades', 'are', 'inappropriate', 'drama', 'rock', 'star', 'Bret', 'good', 'guy', 'bad', 'boy', 'image', 'pull', 'off', 'main', 'character', 'movie', 'petty', 'criminal', 'who', 'framed', 'murder', 'laughable', 'how', 'tip', 'good', 'guy/criminal', 'line', 'being', 'massive', 'conspiracy', 'twist', 'Bret', 'character', 'not', 'just', 'fighting', 'own', 'life', 'justice', 'entire', 'community', 'hand', 'corrupt', 'politicians.The', 'acting', 'bad', 'plot', 'predictably', 'bad', 'soundtrack', 'rotten', 'Bret', 'own', 'hero', 'worship', 'shameless', 'know', 'what', 'Poison', 'fan', 'line', 'bad', 'so-bad-its-good', 'Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'rent', 'single', 'viewing']",N/A
