I had no idea what to expect from this movie. FAIR WARNING: the spoiler alert has been sounded. Read no further if you want to be surprised. Sex addiction is a byproduct of familial dysfunction (similar to substance abuse). For those who struggle with this addiction, they face daily challenges that many of us do not recognize. Kudos to the writers, director and actors in this film, who quite successfully raise awareness of what the struggle of sex addiction is for some. The behavior of the medical resident in the film (portrayed by Josh Gad), is true to life. I have personal experience in a biomedical setting in which a medical resident was apprehended in the library using a mirror to look-up female skirts. The addiction is real. The addiction crosses all social, ethnic, economic lines and boundaries. Does Mark Ruffalo ever turn-in a bad performance? Maybe. But I haven't seen one yet. The cast is so good and because of their talent, this addiction can come-out of the closet, into the light of day.  Dysfunction's products (various addictions) do not go away. There is no cure for any of the behaviors that are a result of this human condition. The best we have are strategies for providing daily comfort and solace which for some may require more than support or cognitive behavioral therapy, but with films like this one, perhaps the stigma of sex addiction will dissipate and folks can without shame, seek the help they desire.",4,"Seriously underrated subject, receives serious treatment!",1390521600,"01 24, 2014",2014,1586,"['have', 'not', 'read', 'reviews', 'movie', 'must', 'start', 'saying', ""'m"", 'going', 'mention', 'topic', 'was', 'bit', 'surprise', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'movie', 'FAIR', 'WARNING', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'been', 'sounded', 'Read', 'further', 'want', 'be', 'surprised', 'Sex', 'addiction', 'byproduct', 'familial', 'dysfunction', 'similar', 'substance', 'abuse', 'who', 'struggle', 'addiction', 'face', 'daily', 'challenges', 'many', 'do', 'not', 'recognize', 'Kudos', 'writers', 'director', 'actors', 'film', 'who', 'quite', 'successfully', 'raise', 'awareness', 'what', 'struggle', 'sex', 'addiction', 'behavior', 'medical', 'resident', 'film', 'portrayed', 'Josh', 'Gad', 'true', 'life', 'have', 'personal', 'experience', 'biomedical', 'setting', 'medical', 'resident', 'was', 'apprehended', 'library', 'using', 'mirror', 'look-up', 'female', 'skirts', 'addiction', 'real', 'addiction', 'social', 'ethnic', 'economic', 'lines', 'boundaries', 'Does', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'ever', 'bad', 'performance', 'Maybe', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'one', 'yet', 'cast', 'so', 'good', 'talent', 'addiction', 'can', 'come-out', 'closet', 'light', 'day', 'Dysfunction', 'products', 'various', 'addictions', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'away', 'cure', 'behaviors', 'are', 'result', 'human', 'condition', 'best', 'have', 'are', 'strategies', 'providing', 'daily', 'comfort', 'solace', 'may', 'require', 'more', 'support', 'cognitive', 'behavioral', 'therapy', 'films', 'one', 'perhaps', 'stigma', 'sex', 'addiction', 'will', 'dissipate', 'folks', 'can', 'shame', 'seek', 'help', 'desire']",N/A
1673683,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B00FXWAZW8,David A. Wend,"[15, 17]","My wife and I decided to see Thanks For Sharing having read a synopsis of the plot online. Although the film is listed as a comedy/drama (I have even see it called a romantic comedy) it is more serious drama.  (Spoilers follow) The subject of the film is sex addiction and the film's main focus is on three characters: Adam (Mark Ruffalo) who is a successful consultant, Mike (Tim Robbins) a small business owner who was addicted to alcohol and has a son who is addicted to pain killers and Neil (Josh Gad) who is a doctor.  Adam has been a sober sex addict for five years when he meets Phoebe (Gwyneth Paltrow) whom he falls in love with but can't find a way to tell her about his addiction. Mike's son Danny returns home having served time in jail and is welcomes by his mother (Joey Richardson) but not Mike who thinks his son weak in fighting his addiction. The comic relief in the film is provided by Neil who has some funny scenes pedaling around on a bike. Pink has an excellent supporting role as Dede, a hair stylist who needs help navigating from her sex addiction and finds a soul mate in Neil.  (end spoilers)The film follows the three main characters as they succeed in controlling their addiction, falter and struggle to pull their lives back together. The screen play by director Stuart Blumberg takes a hard look at addition and living with the disease daily and how it can destroy relationships. The film has wonderful performances by all of the actors involved. Mark Ruffalo and Tim Robbins are especially excellent in their roles appearing pillars of strength but maintaining vulnerability as they face their addiction and help other overcome theirs. You care about all of the characters in the film and become involved in their lives, successes and failures.

1673687,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00FXWAZW8,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","Stuart Blumberg is a director who takes chances (The Girl Next Door , The Kids Are All Right, Keeping the Faith). Using a screenplay he wrote in conjunction with actor Matt Winston he approaches a subject rarely touched upon (or even known about to the general public) - sex addiction - and with the very capable assistance of a superb cast of actors he brings it off. The film may disturb some, especially those easily offended by the degree of self indulgence that story addresses, but stay with this story to the end and be enlightened and touched by the triumph of the human spirit over seemingly insurmountable odds.The story centers around three sex addicts who must attend 12 step meetings, have a sponsor, and refrain from onanism or frottage or viewing pornography, sharing their shortcomings at eh meetings of fellow addicts. Adam (Mark Ruffalo) is an environmental consultant whose has been `sober' for five years and has as his sponsor Mike (Tim Robbins), a small business owner married to the supportive Katie (Jowly Richardson) with whom he has a disowned alcoholic son Danny (Patrick Fugit), and who is sponsor to the obese foolhardy voyeuristic frottage obsessed ER Doc Neil (Josh Gad) whose mother Roberta (Carol Kane) has no clue about her son's debilitating condition. The three men - Adam, Mike, and Neil - interact in needy ways and each faces a crisis he must address: Adam finally meets a girl to whom he can possibly relate, breast cancer survivor Phoebe (Gwyneth Paltrow); Mike must deal with his son Danny's return to the nest; Neil becomes tied to Dede (Pink) who is a sex addict of the first order and desperate to change. It all works in at times confusing ways, but always with a focus on the fragility of the addicted human being - no matter the source of dependency.The film has its light moments, but it is certainly more of a drama than a comedy - except for the fact that  `all of life in the human comedy.'

THANKS FOR SHARING is a dramedy about something that most people either take very seriously or don't believe is a real problem, which is sex addiction. We are introduced to three generations of men who are sex addicts who are in a support group together: The elder statesman and super-sponsor Mike (Tim Robbins) who has had his share of various addictions over the years; the up-and-comer and five years sober Adam (Mark Ruffalo), and the newbie Neil (Josh Gad) who is in a hell he can't get out of because he is refusing to do the work.All three of these men have trigger points to deal with throughout the film; Mike's addict son Danny (Patrick Fugit) has returned after a years-long absence claiming he's clean; Adam falls hard for the beautiful Phoebe (Gwyneth Paltrow), a breast cancer survivor and a very sexual woman who, after a long relationship with an alcoholic, has sworn off addicts for good; Neil is a doctor who is addicted to rubbing up against attractive women on the subway, and is actually court-ordered to be in this group. All of them struggle, but only one can really start to claim success when newcomer Dede (Alecia Moore aka pop star Pink) comes into the group. Mike can't trust his son, but also can't forgive himself for what his addiction has done to his wife Katie (Joely Richardson). Adam and Phoebe, despite being seemingly perfect together, have serious issues with one another as far as trust is concerned as their relationship deepens. Neil befriends the wild child that Dede is, and they both end up helping each other in starting to overcome their addictions.The film is a real step up from the &#34;affluent-white-people-with-problems&#34; that plagued THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT, although some of those do creep in. There is maybe once character of color in this whole film, and he's relegated to the sidelines. All of the characters are very well-to-do, which gives the film the opportunity to focus on their addictive tendencies, but still rings a little false that there is very little diversity in the cast and the characters. It's easier to overlook the flaws in this film, however, due to the super-strong performances given by Ruffalo, Robbins, Paltrow and particularly Gad and Moore, who really shine.The film's direction is subtle and the script is smart to never demonize nor revel in the addictions of its characters, allowing us to make our own judgments and relate to the characters on a human level. This isn't like Steve McQueen's brilliant SHAME, which is rightly so all about how awful and overwhelming it is, but rather a film about how there is a light at the end of the tunnel for these characters. Moments of dark and light populate this film which is probably its greatest strength. It never sways too far one way or the other.THANKS FOR SHARING is a film with some problems, but they are largely overcome by the strength of its cast and its characters.",4,"Honest, funny, biting, with some surprising performances.",1403136000,"06 19, 2014",2014,3101,"['Stuart', 'Blumberg', 'writer', 'incredibly', 'overrated', 'THE', 'KIDS', 'ARE', 'ALL', 'RIGHT', 'incredibly', 'underrated', 'THE', 'GIRL', 'NEXT', 'DOOR', 'directorial', 'debut', 'crafted', 'something', 'pretty', 'surprising', 'THANKS', 'FOR', 'SHARING', 'dramedy', 'something', 'most', 'people', 'take', 'very', 'seriously', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'real', 'problem', 'sex', 'addiction', 'are', 'introduced', 'three', 'generations', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'sex', 'addicts', 'who', 'are', 'support', 'group', 'together', 'elder', 'statesman', 'super-sponsor', 'Mike', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'who', 'had', 'share', 'various', 'addictions', 'years', 'up-and-comer', 'five', 'years', 'sober', 'Adam', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'newbie', 'Neil', 'Josh', 'Gad', 'who', 'hell', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'out', 'refusing', 'do', 'work.All', 'three', 'men', 'have', 'trigger', 'points', 'deal', 'film', 'Mike', 'addict', 'son', 'Danny', 'Patrick', 'Fugit', 'returned', 'years-long', 'absence', 'claiming', 'clean', 'Adam', 'hard', 'beautiful', 'Phoebe', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'breast', 'cancer', 'survivor', 'very', 'sexual', 'woman', 'who', 'long', 'relationship', 'alcoholic', 'sworn', 'off', 'addicts', 'good', 'Neil', 'doctor', 'who', 'addicted', 'rubbing', 'up', 'attractive', 'women', 'subway', 'actually', 'court-ordered', 'be', 'group', 'struggle', 'only', 'one', 'can', 'really', 'start', 'claim', 'success', 'when', 'newcomer', 'Dede', 'Alecia', 'Moore', 'aka', 'pop', 'star', 'Pink', 'group', 'Mike', 'ca', ""n't"", 'trust', 'son', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forgive', 'what', 'addiction', 'done', 'wife', 'Katie', 'Joely', 'Richardson', 'Adam', 'Phoebe', 'being', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'together', 'have', 'serious', 'issues', 'one', 'as', 'far', 'trust', 'concerned', 'relationship', 'deepens', 'Neil', 'wild', 'child', 'Dede', 'end', 'up', 'helping', 'other', 'starting', 'overcome', 'addictions.The', 'film', 'real', 'step', 'up', '34', 'affluent-white-people-with-problems', '34', 'plagued', 'KIDS', 'ARE', 'ALL', 'RIGHT', 'do', 'creep', 'maybe', 'once', 'character', 'color', 'whole', 'film', 'relegated', 'sidelines', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'well-to-do', 'film', 'opportunity', 'focus', 'addictive', 'tendencies', 'still', 'little', 'false', 'very', 'little', 'diversity', 'cast', 'characters', 'easier', 'overlook', 'flaws', 'film', 'however', 'due', 'super-strong', 'performances', 'given', 'Ruffalo', 'Robbins', 'Paltrow', 'particularly', 'Gad', 'Moore', 'who', 'really', 'shine.The', 'film', 'direction', 'subtle', 'script', 'smart', 'never', 'demonize', 'revel', 'addictions', 'characters', 'allowing', 'make', 'own', 'judgments', 'relate', 'characters', 'human', 'level', ""n't"", 'like', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'brilliant', 'SHAME', 'rightly', 'so', 'all', 'how', 'awful', 'overwhelming', 'rather', 'film', 'how', 'light', 'end', 'tunnel', 'characters', 'Moments', 'dark', 'light', 'populate', 'film', 'probably', 'greatest', 'strength', 'never', 'too', 'far', 'one', 'way', 'other.THANKS', 'FOR', 'SHARING', 'film', 'problems', 'are', 'largely', 'overcome', 'strength', 'cast', 'characters']",N/A

It sheds light on what is still a misunderstood addiction that is as potentially damaging to one's life and family, as drugs, alcohol, and other seemingly more serious addictions.This is a drama/comedy, but there's more drama than comedy. It centers around main characters; Adam (Mark Ruffalo), Mike (Tim Robbins), and Neil (Josh Gad) and their various stages of recovery from sexual addiction. It is a multilayered story as it also shows us how their addictions and attempts at recovery affect their personal lives and relationships. Adam's new girlfriend (Paltrow) shows us a very realistic portrayal of how a single woman would react when she discovers Adam's addiction. At one point when Adam confesses that he is a sexual addict, she says something like, &#34;Isn't that what men say they have who just want to sleep around with a lot of women?&#34; which unfortunately, IS how many view this very real and very damaging addiction. Joely Richardson, who plays Katie, Robbin's long-time (and long suffering and patient) wife, does a great job playing a woman who has been through the ropes throughout a long marriage with a spouse who has had his ups and downs - with both sexual and alcohol addiction.True to virtually all addictions; anyone can &#34;fall off the wagon&#34; at anytime no matter how long they've been &#34;clean&#34; or &#34;sober,&#34; and the movie does a good job of showing us this.This is certainly a unique story and well played out, and therefore interesting and entertaining but there are some gritty moments (scenes) that are true to the nature of an addiction of this sort so if you're looking for a light hearted comedy, this is not the movie for you. However, if you're interested in a multilayered story about how addiction affects people in the real world - and how they cope (or not), then you will not be disappointed.What I especially liked about this movie is that they also present a woman who is battling sex addiction (played quite well by singer, Pink) as many people assume that this is just a man's problem. Neil (Gad) gives a great performance as a young doctor who is just beginning to attempt recovery and yet at the same time, still holding on to  his self-destructive behaviors.",4,"Good story but don't expect a happy-go-lucky ""hollywood"" ending",1391731200,"02 7, 2014",2014,2300,"['good', 'story', 'people', 'battling', 'sex', 'other', 'addictions', 'light', 'what', 'still', 'misunderstood', 'addiction', 'potentially', 'damaging', 'one', 'life', 'family', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'other', 'seemingly', 'more', 'serious', 'addictions.This', 'drama/comedy', 'more', 'drama', 'comedy', 'around', 'main', 'characters', 'Adam', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Mike', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Neil', 'Josh', 'Gad', 'various', 'stages', 'recovery', 'sexual', 'addiction', 'multilayered', 'story', 'also', 'how', 'addictions', 'attempts', 'recovery', 'affect', 'personal', 'lives', 'relationships', 'Adam', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Paltrow', 'very', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'how', 'single', 'woman', 'would', 'react', 'when', 'Adam', 'addiction', 'one', 'point', 'when', 'Adam', 'sexual', 'addict', 'something', '34', ""n't"", 'what', 'men', 'say', 'have', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'sleep', 'around', 'lot', 'women', '34', 'unfortunately', 'IS', 'how', 'many', 'view', 'very', 'real', 'very', 'damaging', 'addiction', 'Joely', 'Richardson', 'who', 'Katie', 'Robbin', 'long-time', 'long', 'suffering', 'patient', 'wife', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'ropes', 'long', 'marriage', 'spouse', 'who', 'had', 'ups', 'downs', 'sexual', 'alcohol', 'addiction.True', 'virtually', 'addictions', 'anyone', 'can', '34', 'fall', 'off', 'wagon', '34', 'anytime', 'matter', 'how', 'long', ""'ve"", 'been', '34', 'clean', '34', '34', 'sober', '34', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'this.This', 'certainly', 'unique', 'story', 'well', 'played', 'out', 'therefore', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'are', 'gritty', 'moments', 'scenes', 'are', 'true', 'nature', 'addiction', 'sort', 'so', ""'re"", 'looking', 'light', 'hearted', 'comedy', 'not', 'movie', 'However', ""'re"", 'interested', 'multilayered', 'story', 'how', 'addiction', 'people', 'real', 'world', 'how', 'cope', 'not', 'then', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed.What', 'especially', 'liked', 'movie', 'also', 'present', 'woman', 'who', 'battling', 'sex', 'addiction', 'played', 'quite', 'well', 'singer', 'Pink', 'many', 'people', 'assume', 'just', 'man', 'problem', 'Neil', 'Gad', 'great', 'performance', 'young', 'doctor', 'who', 'just', 'beginning', 'attempt', 'recovery', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'still', 'holding', 'self-destructive', 'behaviors']",N/A

It features 4 AA types: the humourless long-timer, the super-serious mid-timer, the court-mandated unbeliever, and the raw newbie.  AA mantras are repeated by our characters, so if you have a low tolerance for those you may dislike this film.What I like about this film:It reacquaints you with just how many sexual images assault our public spaces thanks to advertising.When one of the addicts is about to lose it, he's standing at the counter of a convenience store with a fifth of bourbon, scratch-off tickets, a 3 Musketeers bar, all the while eyeing a woman in short-shorts in the aisle behind him.  The equal-opportunity-ness of it (sex, sugar, gambling, and alcohol) is just so horrifyingly true and hilarious.  And yet, a 3 Musketeers bar?  There's cheapness even in the excess.  Maybe that's what compulsion is, cheapness in the excess.The non-addict in one of the couples admits that their own issues may have kept them in a relationship with an addict-- not that this can ever be an excuse for the damage done to family members!One couple discusses their relationship.  The addict thinks if they ""do the work,"" the relationship will work.  The non-addict thinks they should still be in their honeymoon phase.  The addict asks them what book they read that in.  It's interesting to consider what informs our beliefs about the natural course of romantic relationships and how much work is required.  Nuclear family?  Regional culture?  Popular culture?  Film?  Let's say this film is informed by popular culture that's informed by films adapted from self-help books that says ""relationships require work.""  It's the circularity that makes it appear obvious.  Let's extend the idea that ""relationships require work"" to the idea that ""life requires work.""  That may be less obvious, especially to an addict whose addiction involves avoiding the work of going through moments of anxiety, discomfort or pain that make up life.",4,"Good, for the sort of film is it",1389398400,"01 11, 2014",2014,2033,"['Thanks', 'Sharing', 'bit', 'Public', 'Service', 'Announcement', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'bit', 'amusing.It', 'pro-AA', '4', 'AA', 'types', 'humourless', 'long-timer', 'super-serious', 'mid-timer', 'court-mandated', 'unbeliever', 'raw', 'newbie', 'AA', 'mantras', 'are', 'repeated', 'characters', 'so', 'have', 'low', 'tolerance', 'may', 'dislike', 'film.What', 'like', 'film', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'sexual', 'images', 'assault', 'public', 'spaces', 'thanks', 'advertising.When', 'one', 'addicts', 'lose', 'standing', 'counter', 'convenience', 'store', 'fifth', 'bourbon', 'scratch-off', 'tickets', '3', 'Musketeers', 'bar', 'while', 'eyeing', 'woman', 'short-shorts', 'aisle', 'equal-opportunity-ness', 'sex', 'sugar', 'gambling', 'alcohol', 'just', 'so', 'horrifyingly', 'true', 'hilarious', 'yet', '3', 'Musketeers', 'bar', 'cheapness', 'even', 'excess', 'what', 'compulsion', 'cheapness', 'excess.The', 'non-addict', 'one', 'couples', 'own', 'issues', 'may', 'have', 'kept', 'relationship', 'addict', 'not', 'can', 'ever', 'be', 'excuse', 'damage', 'done', 'family', 'members', 'One', 'couple', 'relationship', 'addict', 'thinks', 'do', 'work', 'relationship', 'will', 'work', 'non-addict', 'thinks', 'should', 'still', 'be', 'honeymoon', 'phase', 'addict', 'what', 'book', 'read', 'interesting', 'consider', 'what', 'beliefs', 'natural', 'course', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'how', 'much', 'work', 'required', 'Nuclear', 'family', 'Regional', 'culture', 'Popular', 'culture', 'Film', 'Let', 'say', 'film', 'informed', 'popular', 'culture', 'informed', 'films', 'adapted', 'self-help', 'books', 'relationships', 'require', 'work', 'circularity', 'appear', 'obvious', 'Let', 'extend', 'idea', 'relationships', 'require', 'work', 'idea', 'life', 'work', 'may', 'be', 'less', 'obvious', 'especially', 'addict', 'addiction', 'avoiding', 'work', 'going', 'moments', 'anxiety', 'discomfort', 'pain', 'make', 'up', 'life']",N/A

This is one of those movies. I had heard virtually nothing about this movie other than it was something Redbox chose to highlight as a pick of the week. If it played in theaters locally it wasn't for long. Too bad because even with the sensitive subject matter it deserved more viewers.The story revolves around three men all involved in various stages of sex addiction. I know, you're probably laughing at the topic but the truth is it's a very serious addiction that more people are falling prey to these days. The reason why becomes obvious as the film opens to find Mark Ruffalo as Adam making his way to work and confronted with various displays of women half clad in billboard and poster ads plastered everywhere on the streets of New York. Adam is a successful at work but struggles with the daily confrontations. In spite of those he is 5 years &#34;sober&#34; which he brings up at the SA meeting he goes to.We also meet Mike (Tim Robbins), a small business owner who remodels homes and who is also an addict. But Mike is more than just a sex addict, he's been through various other addictions as well like alcohol. The twelve step programs Mike has used to bring him back to reality have worked but also become his newest addiction. He is a support person for Adam as well as others in the group and more often than not lends his help to them more than he does his own family. The tension between Mike and his son Danny (Patrick Fugit) is palpable in part due to Danny's past problems with drugs and poor choices made when he was young. Where Mike might forgive his addictive friends he rarely thinks the best of Danny, now clean and sober and trying to make things right.The third member of the trio lends the comedic aspects of the movie in an attempt to lighten things up a bit. Neil (Josh Gad) is a doctor who's been ordered to go to SA meetings after some incidents involving inappropriate behavior. But Neil isn't taking things seriously enough as we witness when he presses his body up against a lady on the subway. Adam is his sponsor but isn't willing to help him since he doesn't take it seriously. Events happen that force Neil to confront the person he has become and Adam, along with fellow SA member DeDe (Alecia Moore aka Pink), might actually make it out of this alive.Along with these three characters and their stories we're introduced to a woman Adam meets and begins dating, Phoebe (Gwyneth Paltrow). Encouraged by Mike to start dating, he meets her at a party and they get along with ease. Once it looks like they might be doing well, she mentions to Adam that her last boyfriend was an alcoholic and her intentions of never being with another addict again. Rather than inform her then, Adam feels things are going so well he hides his problem only to be forced to confront this deception at a later date.While this may seem like more information than you need just to watch the movie, it does offer just a glimpse of what is to come. It sets the stage for the drama and comedy that unfolds as we watch these three separate people deal with varying stages of the addiction they all suffer with. And while most would joke about the term sexual addiction you have to admit that the influence of sex in our lives has gone to extremes from movies to pop stars to commercials for Victoria's Secret airing during prime time. How could there not be a problem arises from all of this?Each of the actors does a tremendous job of fleshing out their characters in the small amount of time they are given. While Ruffalo and Robbins might get the most attention it is Gad who does the best job of the three, showing that comedic side that attempts to disguise his addiction but eventually letting it all flow freely in his cry for help. While he offers the biggest surprise here Moore does a great job on her first outing in a major role as well.If you're afraid of the touchy subject matter, that's understandable. But don't let it prevent you from watching some great performances as well as getting to hear a story told well. It might be a movie too uncomfortable to watch over and over again but it is still one worth watching and perhaps revisiting now and again, especially if Gad becomes a force to be reckoned with down the road.",4,...AND I AM A SEX ADDICT,1393372800,"02 26, 2014",2014,4420,"['One', 'best', 'things', 'found', 'world', 'movie', 'lovers', 'film', 'expect', 'nothing', 'so', 'much', 'are', 'stunned', 'how', 'well', 'one', 'movies', 'had', 'heard', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'movie', 'other', 'was', 'something', 'Redbox', 'chose', 'highlight', 'pick', 'week', 'played', 'theaters', 'locally', 'was', ""n't"", 'long', 'Too', 'bad', 'even', 'sensitive', 'subject', 'matter', 'deserved', 'more', 'viewers.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'three', 'men', 'involved', 'various', 'stages', 'sex', 'addiction', 'know', ""'re"", 'probably', 'laughing', 'topic', 'truth', 'very', 'serious', 'addiction', 'more', 'people', 'are', 'falling', 'prey', 'days', 'reason', 'why', 'becomes', 'obvious', 'film', 'find', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Adam', 'making', 'way', 'work', 'confronted', 'various', 'displays', 'women', 'clad', 'billboard', 'poster', 'ads', 'plastered', 'everywhere', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'Adam', 'successful', 'work', 'daily', 'confrontations', 'spite', '5', 'years', '34', 'sober', '34', 'up', 'SA', 'meeting', 'to.We', 'also', 'meet', 'Mike', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'small', 'business', 'owner', 'who', 'homes', 'who', 'also', 'addict', 'Mike', 'more', 'just', 'sex', 'addict', 'been', 'various', 'other', 'addictions', 'well', 'alcohol', 'twelve', 'step', 'programs', 'Mike', 'used', 'bring', 'back', 'reality', 'have', 'worked', 'also', 'become', 'newest', 'addiction', 'support', 'person', 'Adam', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'group', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'help', 'more', 'own', 'family', 'tension', 'Mike', 'son', 'Danny', 'Patrick', 'Fugit', 'palpable', 'part', 'due', 'Danny', 'past', 'problems', 'drugs', 'poor', 'choices', 'made', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'Where', 'Mike', 'might', 'forgive', 'addictive', 'friends', 'rarely', 'best', 'Danny', 'now', 'clean', 'sober', 'trying', 'make', 'things', 'right.The', 'third', 'member', 'trio', 'comedic', 'aspects', 'movie', 'attempt', 'lighten', 'things', 'up', 'bit', 'Neil', 'Josh', 'Gad', 'doctor', 'who', 'been', 'ordered', 'go', 'SA', 'meetings', 'incidents', 'involving', 'inappropriate', 'behavior', 'Neil', ""n't"", 'taking', 'things', 'seriously', 'enough', 'witness', 'when', 'body', 'up', 'lady', 'subway', 'Adam', 'sponsor', ""n't"", 'willing', 'help', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'Events', 'happen', 'force', 'Neil', 'confront', 'person', 'become', 'Adam', 'fellow', 'SA', 'member', 'DeDe', 'Alecia', 'Moore', 'Pink', 'might', 'actually', 'make', 'alive.Along', 'three', 'characters', 'stories', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'woman', 'Adam', 'meets', 'dating', 'Phoebe', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Encouraged', 'Mike', 'start', 'dating', 'party', 'get', 'ease', 'might', 'be', 'doing', 'well', 'Adam', 'last', 'boyfriend', 'was', 'alcoholic', 'intentions', 'never', 'being', 'addict', 'again', 'Rather', 'inform', 'then', 'Adam', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'so', 'well', 'problem', 'only', 'be', 'forced', 'confront', 'deception', 'later', 'may', 'seem', 'more', 'information', 'need', 'just', 'watch', 'movie', 'offer', 'just', 'glimpse', 'what', 'come', 'stage', 'drama', 'comedy', 'watch', 'three', 'separate', 'people', 'deal', 'varying', 'stages', 'addiction', 'suffer', 'most', 'would', 'joke', 'term', 'sexual', 'addiction', 'have', 'admit', 'influence', 'sex', 'lives', 'gone', 'extremes', 'movies', 'pop', 'stars', 'commercials', 'Victoria', 'Secret', 'airing', 'prime', 'time', 'How', 'could', 'there', 'not', 'be', 'problem', 'actors', 'tremendous', 'job', 'fleshing', 'out', 'characters', 'small', 'amount', 'time', 'are', 'given', 'Ruffalo', 'Robbins', 'might', 'get', 'most', 'attention', 'Gad', 'who', 'best', 'job', 'three', 'showing', 'comedic', 'side', 'disguise', 'addiction', 'eventually', 'letting', 'flow', 'freely', 'cry', 'help', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'here', 'Moore', 'great', 'job', 'first', 'outing', 'major', 'role', 'well.If', ""'re"", 'afraid', 'touchy', 'subject', 'matter', 'understandable', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'prevent', 'watching', 'great', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'getting', 'hear', 'story', 'told', 'well', 'might', 'be', 'movie', 'too', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'still', 'one', 'worth', 'watching', 'perhaps', 'revisiting', 'now', 'again', 'especially', 'Gad', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'road']",N/A

Unfortunately the script is a bit suspect and the film moves back and forth between a serious drama about addiction and a romantic comedy.  Certainly, the movie was marketed as a romcom and even the jacket cover displays quotes like ""Laugh-Out-Loud-Funny"" and ""Romantic, Smart, Funny.""  And while there is romance and there is humor, for the most part, the film plays serious.While no one chuckles about alcohol or drug addiction and the efforts to treat as diseases, sexual addiction is, let's face it, a bit harder to accept.  With Josh Gad playing a medical doctor named Neil (funny to even think about) with a sex addiction you can perhaps understand the misclassification.  The story centers around Adam (Mark Ruffalo), a businessman who is  5 years clear of sex (of any kind).  He regularly attends an AA meeting geared toward those similarly afflicted.  His sponsor is Mike (Tim Robbins), a recovering alcoholic.  His wife Katie (Joely Richardson) isn't clearly addicted to anything, but does keep a bottle of Percocet handy.Adam has one of those cute meets-at-a-party involving Phoebe (Gwyneth Paltrow).  They end up going to lunch and get more and more serious.  Eventually Mike has to come clean on the sex addiction thing, although he doesn't spring it on her for some time in typical Hollywood fashion.  When these things happen in movies, we all know what the reaction will be.  Now while Phoebe isn't addicted to anything, she is compulsive about several things.  Her food for example.  No clashing colors touching.  Small portions.  Training for a triathlon.Patrick Fugit plays the son of Mike and Katie.  They haven't seen him in years and yep, you guessed it, he's a drug addict.  All of these characters intermingle and add to the drama.  It gets to be a bit much and occasionally swerves into melodrama.  The performances are all very good including one by Alecia Moore, aka Pink, who plays one of the few female sex addicts in the movie.  For those looking for a more tradition romantic comedy, look elsewhere.The Blu ray disc comes with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio and 1080p resolution and it looks very good.  While this digitally shot film isn't one of those eye-poppers we sometimes see, it is satisfying with good clarity and color accuracy.  The audio includes a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track which much like the video isn't awe inspiring but very consistent, clear and directionally interesting.  Some of the best displays using the surrounds are in the several scenes in Manhattan, especially with the traffic.  Extras include a commentary track featuring director, Stuart Blumberg, a gag reel, some deleted scenes and a making of featurette called ""One Step at a Time.""

1673701,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00FXWAZW8,Paul Allaer,"[39, 40]","""Thanks For Sharing"" (2012 release; 112 min.) is billed as a comedy-drama, but really is mostly a drama about three guys in a 12 step program to deal with their sex addiction. Mike (played by Tim Robbins) is the 'elder statesman' of the group, who seems to have everything completely under control. Adam (played by Mark Ruffalo) is the middle-aged guy who's been on the wagon for 5 years, and now meets and falls for Phoebe (played by Gwyneth Paltrow). Then there is Neil (played by Josh Gad), a twenty-some loveable slob who is desperately trying to get on the wagon. He befriends Dede (played by Alecia Moore, a/k/a P!ink). Last but certainly not least there is Danny (played by Patrick Fugit), the 30 yr. old son of Mike and his wife, returning home unexpectedly after years away. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie has gotten a lot of less than positive reviews by the so-called experts/film critics, and hence I went to see this with low expectations. As it turns out, this movie played out very nicely, in particular when staying away from the comedy aspects (which weren't all that funny), and instead focusing on the impact of addiction to lives and relationships. The performances were generally speaking pretty darn good, but for me the best work is done by P!nk, and even more so by Patrick Fugit, who you may remember as the wide-eyed teenager in Cameron Crowe's ""Almost Famous"" back in 2000. Fugit is now a man, and his role as the long-lost son is the most memorable in the movie for me. Please note that the movie has a great soundtrack, both as to the songs (featuring the Heavy, Elvis Costello, St. Vincent, and Family of the Year, just to name those) and the instrumental film score, and both of those are available here on Amazon.""Thanks for Sharing"" opened on just 2 screens for all of Greater Cincinnati last month. The screening I saw this at was not well attended, and I'm being mild (three people, including myself), which did not bode well for its success on the big screen (in fact the movie disappeared after just a couple of weeks). But I wouldn't be surprised if this is one of those movies that finds a second life when the DVD is released. All that aside, don't be spooked by the so-called experts/film critics.

1673703,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00FXWAZW8,RMurray847,"[17, 19]","THANKS FOR SHARING is another in a long line of movies about addicts and the effects of the addiction on family & friends.  However, because alcohol and drug addiction has been presented over and over and over&#8230;this film is about sex addiction.  That adds an element of titillation that is missing from movies about alcoholics!If my tone seems a bit dismissive, it&#8217;s because THANKS FOR SHARING is a very skin-deep movie that mostly pretends to have something deep or meaningful to say.  It&#8217;s a breezy drama/comedy about a serious and damaging topic.  The movie is not without value or interest&#8230;not at all.  But I want to get out of the way right at the beginning that for all it accomplishes, one thing it does NOT do is really make me understand much about sex addiction.  As one character in the movie says (and I&#8217;m paraphrasing): &#8220;Is sex addiction a real thing?  I thought it was what husbands used as an excuse when they get caught cheating.&#8221;  While I&#8217;d like to think my attitude was a bit more understanding, this is a subject that is a bit fuzzy to me.  Drugs/alcohol I can comprehend.  An alcoholic drinking a lot is bad because they damage their health and do dangerous things.  A sex addict does WHAT exactly?Anyway, THANKS FOR SHARING is more of a relationship movie.  We have our lead character, Mark Ruffalo, a recovering sex addict (5 years sober) who has spent a sexless existence with no home access to the internet, no TV and full of little tricks to help him focus on his &#8220;sobriety.&#8221;  Now he&#8217;s interested in venturing into the dating world again, and he meets Gwyneth Paltrow, a cancer survivor who has been burned by previous relationships with addicts.  The two spend a lot of time smiling at each other and laughing at each other&#8217;s bad jokes and terrible repartee.  They MUST be in love, because if not, they&#8217;d find each other insufferable.  Both actors can be VERY charming, but somehow they don&#8217;t work well together.  Ruffalo is much better in his NON Paltrow scenes, particularly towards the end, when his character takes a dramatic turn.Tim Robbins plays the nominal &#8220;leader&#8221; of the support group.  An addict himself, he appears to be addicted to providing support.  He is full of pithy sayings and knows just the right times to put arms around shoulders in an encouraging way.  In many ways, he is deeply unlikable because he never really shows his real self.  Yes, he helps the addicts and that&#8217;s a good thing.  But he is so smug and self-satisfied, with his self-loathing just beneath the surface.  He relates to the addicts because he is superior to them.  But his wife (Joely Richardson) is someone he can barely relate to because he carries the guilt over the horrible things he&#8217;s done to her during his time of no sobriety.  We never get any specifics, but he clearly resents HER for the things she knows about him.  This relationship and Robbins&#8217; character are far more interesting.  And when their adult son (Patrick Fugit) a drug addict and ex-con, comes home seemingly to make amends, some very difficult and bristly old business comes up.  It&#8217;s a bit clich&eacute;d, all of it&#8230;but this portion of the movie has the most oomph.For decent comic relief we&#8217;ve got Josh Gad (from Broadway&#8217;s BOOK OF MORMON) as a newly recovering addict and his growing friendship with fellow addict Alecia Moore (better known as the singer Pink).  They establish an easy rapport and Gad has nice comic timing and Moore is nearly his equal.  Their growing relationship, although a little hard to swallow, is also far more interesting than Ruffalo and Paltrow.The trailers for this movie (and the poster) make it seem like this is a comedy, with some dramatic undertones.  That is HUGELY misleading.  The laughs are mild and infrequent.  It&#8217;s more of a drama about some people who crack a lot of jokes.  It is never dull, even as most plot points play out so predictably.  Movies about addiction are a lot like sports movies&#8230;the path is well-worn and familiar.  Sure, they may occasionally drift off to look at something different, but they always return to the path.  THANKS FOR SHARING is very much like that.  It felt familiar and comfortable, but a bit threadbare and well-worn too.  If a comfort drama about sex addicts sounds good, by all means check out the film.",3,A skin-deep dramedy.

1673708,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B00FXWAZW8,Sheryl Fechter,"[1, 1]","I first read an overview of the film here on Amazon, then on the Blu-ray when at our neighborhood rental store.  Its description stated basically, 'Three obsessive people meeting within a support group to set into motion a life changing journey'.  With this write-up and an interesting cast; What's not to like?  Co-written and directed by Stuart Blumberg, I was a little surprised that the main focus of their obsession was sex, and they all were addicted to it in some fashion.  This is quite a serious problem for all involved in the person's life.  I may have thought more about it before renting, although I am glad that I did and watched this.  I found it very interesting and very well acted throughout, exploring a world that I didn't really know very much about. I also learned so much from Dede, (Alecia Moore or ""Pink""), being a lively, spirited, and much appreciated for her candor, part of the cast.  She seemed to portray things in the easiest way for me to understand, as in the what and whys.Their support group functions just as the well known twelve-step programs do.  The different participants have sponsors to aid them with working on their addictions, having similar issues to discuss.  Some have more than the one, including alcohol and narcotics, and the problem with sexual behaviors and exploits compounding their struggles.  There were also some women present and involved. I hadn't ever given much thought to this in my own naivete about the matter.  The head of the group is Mike (Tim Robbins), who has been in the group for a long time and also in a long term marriage.  His wife (Joely Richardson) and he have a son, Danny (Patrick Fugit, ""Almost Famous""), who really triggers his ire when he returns home after being gone for so long. I found that there would be a lot to focus on just in this family's dynamic alone.  At the meetings, Mike sponsors a couple of the men, but mainly Adam (Mark Ruffalo), who has been successful in abstaining from his personal addictive behaviors for five years now by taking it one day at a time intentionally.  He will go to any and all lengths, even having televisions removed from the hotel rooms he may be staying in. He most certainly takes his sobriety as his first priority.  The third man focused on has just begun coming to the group and is quite far from being on the wagon. A young emergency room doctor, and a likeable goofball named Neil (Josh Gad), who has now gotten himself fired from his position due to his behavior while at the hospital.  He is quite conflicted and seems unable to stick to any of the decisions he has made thus far.  At this point, his heart is not in it.As I mentioned before, Dede is part of the group while acting out in similar sexual and addictive ways.  She needs to, and certainly wants to, stop this part of her life.  She finds a blossoming kinship in her ""big man"" Neil, and they become good friends as time goes by.  It is with her personal help that he is able to get healthy and stronger with her sincere urging.  Even more, their strong friendship is what they love with each other.  This group is full of intense friendship and deep understanding.  When someone in the middle of the night needs one another, they will always come.  There are no situations that would leave one of the group alone or in dire need for help, it is always on the way, all they would have to do is call.There does come a time when Adam is advised by Mike to try dating again after such a long length of sobriety and sticking to the program.  With much trepidation, he meets Phoebe (Gwyneth Paltrow) who has had issues concerning her own physical health.  These two take a shot at a relationship, after telling a silent Adam that she will not get involved with an addict ever again.  Danny, who has been away for eight long years to clean up his own act, comes home like the prodigal son for his parents.  He didn't choose the twelve-step program as his father did and continues to go to groups. Danny white-knuckled it through his own withdrawal as an addict, and it really appears that Mike does not agree with anything Danny does.  Like most movies of this sort, there are some potboilers that do happen, setbacks, and decisions that change the courses of lifetimes.  The cover of the Blu-ray that I read said, ""Laugh Out Loud"" funny.  I didn't get that from this, although there were a couple of comedic moments.  I actually found the movie a drama, more cerebral than funny, giving me something to think about while opening the door to discuss addictions and what they truly mean.",4,"""At This Point In My Sobriety I Don't Even Notice The Externals Of A Woman"" - Adam",1394323200,"03 9, 2014",2014,4579,"['first', 'read', 'overview', 'film', 'here', 'Amazon', 'then', 'Blu-ray', 'when', 'neighborhood', 'rental', 'store', 'description', 'stated', 'basically', ""'Three"", 'obsessive', 'people', 'meeting', 'support', 'group', 'set', 'motion', 'life', 'changing', 'journey', 'write-up', 'interesting', 'cast', 'What', 'not', 'like', 'Co-written', 'directed', 'Stuart', 'Blumberg', 'was', 'little', 'surprised', 'main', 'focus', 'obsession', 'was', 'sex', 'were', 'addicted', 'fashion', 'quite', 'serious', 'problem', 'involved', 'person', 'life', 'may', 'have', 'thought', 'more', 'renting', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'watched', 'found', 'very', 'interesting', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'exploring', 'world', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'very', 'much', 'also', 'learned', 'so', 'much', 'Dede', 'Alecia', 'Moore', 'Pink', 'being', 'lively', 'spirited', 'much', 'appreciated', 'candor', 'part', 'cast', 'seemed', 'portray', 'things', 'easiest', 'way', 'understand', 'what', 'whys.Their', 'support', 'group', 'functions', 'just', 'well', 'known', 'twelve-step', 'programs', 'do', 'different', 'participants', 'have', 'sponsors', 'aid', 'working', 'addictions', 'having', 'similar', 'issues', 'discuss', 'have', 'more', 'one', 'including', 'alcohol', 'narcotics', 'problem', 'sexual', 'behaviors', 'exploits', 'compounding', 'struggles', 'were', 'also', 'women', 'present', 'involved', 'had', ""n't"", 'ever', 'given', 'much', 'thought', 'own', 'naivete', 'matter', 'head', 'group', 'Mike', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'who', 'been', 'group', 'long', 'time', 'also', 'long', 'term', 'marriage', 'wife', 'Joely', 'Richardson', 'have', 'son', 'Danny', 'Patrick', 'Fugit', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'who', 'really', 'ire', 'when', 'home', 'being', 'gone', 'so', 'long', 'found', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'focus', 'just', 'family', 'dynamic', 'alone', 'meetings', 'Mike', 'couple', 'men', 'mainly', 'Adam', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'who', 'been', 'successful', 'abstaining', 'personal', 'addictive', 'behaviors', 'five', 'years', 'now', 'taking', 'one', 'day', 'time', 'intentionally', 'will', 'go', 'lengths', 'even', 'having', 'televisions', 'removed', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'may', 'be', 'staying', 'most', 'certainly', 'sobriety', 'first', 'priority', 'third', 'man', 'focused', 'just', 'begun', 'coming', 'group', 'quite', 'far', 'being', 'wagon', 'young', 'emergency', 'room', 'doctor', 'likeable', 'goofball', 'named', 'Neil', 'Josh', 'Gad', 'who', 'now', 'gotten', 'fired', 'position', 'due', 'behavior', 'hospital', 'quite', 'conflicted', 'unable', 'stick', 'decisions', 'made', 'thus', 'far', 'point', 'heart', 'not', 'it.As', 'mentioned', 'Dede', 'part', 'group', 'acting', 'out', 'similar', 'sexual', 'addictive', 'ways', 'certainly', 'stop', 'part', 'life', 'blossoming', 'kinship', 'big', 'man', 'Neil', 'become', 'good', 'friends', 'time', 'personal', 'help', 'able', 'get', 'healthy', 'stronger', 'sincere', 'urging', 'Even', 'more', 'strong', 'friendship', 'what', 'love', 'other', 'group', 'full', 'intense', 'friendship', 'deep', 'understanding', 'When', 'someone', 'middle', 'night', 'one', 'will', 'always', 'come', 'are', 'situations', 'would', 'leave', 'one', 'group', 'alone', 'dire', 'need', 'help', 'always', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'do', 'call.There', 'come', 'time', 'when', 'Adam', 'advised', 'Mike', 'try', 'dating', 'again', 'such', 'long', 'length', 'sobriety', 'sticking', 'program', 'much', 'trepidation', 'Phoebe', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'who', 'had', 'issues', 'concerning', 'own', 'physical', 'health', 'two', 'take', 'shot', 'relationship', 'telling', 'silent', 'Adam', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'involved', 'addict', 'ever', 'again', 'Danny', 'who', 'been', 'away', 'eight', 'long', 'years', 'clean', 'up', 'own', 'act', 'home', 'prodigal', 'son', 'parents', 'did', ""n't"", 'choose', 'twelve-step', 'program', 'father', 'did', 'go', 'groups', 'Danny', 'white-knuckled', 'own', 'withdrawal', 'addict', 'really', 'Mike', 'not', 'agree', 'anything', 'Danny', 'most', 'movies', 'sort', 'are', 'potboilers', 'do', 'happen', 'setbacks', 'decisions', 'change', 'courses', 'lifetimes', 'cover', 'Blu-ray', 'read', 'said', 'Out', 'Loud', 'funny', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'were', 'couple', 'comedic', 'moments', 'actually', 'found', 'movie', 'drama', 'more', 'cerebral', 'funny', 'giving', 'something', 'think', 'opening', 'door', 'discuss', 'addictions', 'what', 'truly', 'mean']",N/A

Things are going good for Adam until he meets a woman who finds out his secret. Mike encounters problems when his son returns home and Neil's life is crumbling around him because of his problem. This is billed as a romantic comedy but do not be fooled. I would not call this a comedy at all. The movie deals with very serious issues but the acting is the thing that really makes you feel for the characters. Very early on you start to root for everyone in the movie and you live their ups and downs with them. You almost find yourself talking to the screen and yelling NO at certain temptations that face them. This isn't really a movie I can describe you really should see this one to understand. Overall, a very good movie that deserves to be seen but do not expect a comedy. This is a straight drama that leaves you with a feeling you can't describe. I liked it.

Gimmicky novel story. made for pervs or people who think pervs make an interesting gimmicky novel of a plot. It's Not a fun film, just boring, and not interesting it's just idiotic. It is Not a drama or comedy, it's self parody. This film Tries hard to be funny and melodramatic at the same time. Obsession with sex gets old quick. Pervs don't make good quirky indie (wannabe)characters. This film tries so hard to be quirky and witty it comes off annoying. This film wants to come off funny but can't because of the serious subject matter, if it were funny at many points it would be offensive. If it was just dramatic it wouldn't sell. But this film tries to be both and fails pretty badly. Interesting idea turned really bad. Mixing a serious and touchy and sensitive problem such as sex addiction, hurt, depression with comedy doesn't work well. This film tries so hard to sell to a sophisticated witty intellectual indie hipster audience. The elements of this film don't mix. What next?
