43818,A1J87C2DKBO441,078311589X,A. Evans,"[6, 7]",This is a wonderful DVD if you've ever felt cheated by documentaries on Ali where you don't really see the entire fight.  This DVD provides 3 of Ali's greatest fights from the very start of each fight to the post-fight  banter that he always engaged in.  What is particularly great about these 3  fights is that you see a slightly different phase of Ali's boxing style.  From his young days with Liston to one of the infamous slugfests with  Frazier to the incredible upset over Foreman.The thing that struck me  most was that by seeing the entire fight I ended up with a much different  vision of the fight than I had gleaned from documentaries.  His defeat of  Foreman I felt was much more overwhelming than the impression I got from  When We Were Kings for example.  I never felt he was in trouble in this  fight.  Magical stuff.There is also a nice 1 hr documentary that looks  80s-ish that follows him from his career start to his more dubious fights  towards the end.The quality is good visually given the limitations of  the camera back when the fights were fought.  I've seen clips that were in  a horrible state but these were very clean.  The audio is also bad at times  (again limitations on the technology) but you can switch on the subtitles  which help out.,5,Fantastic,962928000,"07 7, 2000",2000,1271,"['wonderful', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'felt', 'cheated', 'documentaries', 'Ali', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'entire', 'fight', 'DVD', '3', 'Ali', 'greatest', 'fights', 'very', 'start', 'fight', 'post-fight', 'banter', 'always', 'engaged', 'What', 'particularly', 'great', '3', 'fights', 'see', 'slightly', 'different', 'phase', 'Ali', 'boxing', 'style', 'young', 'days', 'Liston', 'one', 'infamous', 'slugfests', 'Frazier', 'incredible', 'upset', 'Foreman.The', 'thing', 'struck', 'most', 'was', 'seeing', 'entire', 'fight', 'ended', 'up', 'much', 'different', 'vision', 'fight', 'had', 'gleaned', 'documentaries', 'defeat', 'Foreman', 'felt', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'overwhelming', 'impression', 'got', 'When', 'Were', 'Kings', 'example', 'never', 'felt', 'was', 'trouble', 'fight', 'Magical', 'stuff.There', 'also', 'nice', '1', 'hr', 'documentary', '80s-ish', 'career', 'start', 'more', 'dubious', 'fights', 'end.The', 'quality', 'good', 'visually', 'given', 'limitations', 'camera', 'back', 'when', 'fights', 'were', 'fought', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'clips', 'were', 'horrible', 'state', 'were', 'very', 'clean', 'audio', 'also', 'bad', 'times', 'again', 'limitations', 'technology', 'can', 'switch', 'subtitles', 'help', 'out']",N/A
43819,A2L36PB05OIX3P,078311589X,"C. Barr ""Craig  Barr""","[0, 0]","I love reading about legendary fights but I find it intolerable not to see the fight I have read about, listened to experts explain the story and just get a few seconds of footage from other documentaries which this is not. This collection is brilliant. You get to see the post fight extensive interviews and that to me is priceless. The reason that I searched for this DVD is the Liston/Clay fight. I have read so much about this fight I was so upset to learn that FYE, Blockbuster and everywhere I looked did not have this entire fight until I learned of Amazon therefore I am writing this review after repeatedly watching the fight for the last 3 years almost daily.Round one Liston could not do much except for a shot to the chest-one punch for the entire round. Round 2 was the same but Liston could not land anything. Round 3 Ali (Clay at the time) hurt Liston and Ali was head hunting. O.K. In any clinch, Liston did what he could but he was just wasting energy. So for the 1st 3 rounds Ali was head hunting as he always did and Liston was going  for the body and hoping that the head would come down, he tried a few head shots but it was not effective. In round 4 Liston abandons his body attack and goes head hunting, but the punches were not normal, it was as if he were adamantly trying to simply touch Ali's face. Liston could not land any punishing blows to Ali's head the 3 previous rounds but if he could barley touch Ali's eyes his objective would be accomplished and he was not shy about blatantly trying. Round five-The so called bind round is the most awesome proof that Liston was trying to blind Ali mainly because he again abandoned his body attack believing he would knock out Muhammad Ali. During round 5 Ali's eyes cleared and if you slow down the disc, with 56 seconds left in the round Ali takes his left and as light as day smears his glove on Liston's bloated face for most of the rest of the round and you can see him telling Liston something while he is paying Liston back for the K.O solution which is slang for the anti cut cream that was soon afterwords banned. You have to give credit to Liston for coming out for the 6th round which was essentially a bruised and blinded Liston (from Ali's facial smearing the previous round)trying to retain some pride, but bullies get what they give in Ali's world. I have never read of the facial smearing that Muhammad Ali gave to Sonny Liston for the last 56 seconds of round 5 and I have researched this fight but it is here on this video with almost 15 minutes of post fight footage that is not in any documentary I have seen.The ""Rumble in the Jungle"" can be found on other video's. The two points I will make are that in George Foreman's auto biography ""By George"" he suggests that he was drugged and I believe him. I have never seen a fighter with such glassy eyes from just being tired. O.K.-He didn't train. He relaxed in air conditioning while Muhammad Ali acclimated himself to harsh heat but even in ""The Thriller in Manila"" both fighters were tired and the only time I have seen glassy eyes like Foreman had for over the last 3 rounds is when a knock out punch is administered. The second observation was that the commentary which was provided by David Frost, Jim Brown and Joe Frazier was interesting since Joe Frazier had just lost his title to Foreman and was verbally bitter towards Ali. Also David Frost was just stating the obvious while Jim Brown was right on the money telling his team mates that Muhammad Ali was smart to go to the ropes while Frazier couldn't make up his mind. The post fight interview contained footage that I have never seen and I have the fight from an E.S.P.N. release that does not contain Ali lecturing his fans never to bet against him. It is very interesting.I suggest this DVD but not more than the cost of any other fight film.",5,Just Try Finding this Footage!,1327276800,"01 23, 2012",2012,3849,"['love', 'reading', 'legendary', 'fights', 'find', 'intolerable', 'not', 'see', 'fight', 'have', 'read', 'listened', 'experts', 'explain', 'story', 'just', 'get', 'few', 'seconds', 'footage', 'other', 'documentaries', 'not', 'collection', 'brilliant', 'get', 'see', 'post', 'fight', 'extensive', 'interviews', 'priceless', 'reason', 'searched', 'DVD', 'Liston/Clay', 'fight', 'have', 'read', 'so', 'much', 'fight', 'was', 'so', 'upset', 'learn', 'FYE', 'Blockbuster', 'everywhere', 'looked', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'entire', 'fight', 'learned', 'Amazon', 'therefore', 'am', 'writing', 'review', 'repeatedly', 'watching', 'fight', 'last', '3', 'years', 'almost', 'one', 'Liston', 'could', 'not', 'do', 'much', 'shot', 'chest-one', 'punch', 'entire', 'round', '2', 'was', 'same', 'Liston', 'could', 'not', 'land', 'anything', '3', 'Ali', 'Clay', 'time', 'hurt', 'Liston', 'Ali', 'was', 'head', 'hunting', 'O.K', 'clinch', 'Liston', 'did', 'what', 'could', 'was', 'just', 'wasting', 'energy', 'So', '1st', '3', 'rounds', 'Ali', 'was', 'head', 'hunting', 'always', 'did', 'Liston', 'was', 'going', 'body', 'hoping', 'head', 'would', 'come', 'down', 'tried', 'few', 'head', 'shots', 'was', 'not', 'effective', 'round', '4', 'Liston', 'abandons', 'body', 'attack', 'head', 'hunting', 'punches', 'were', 'not', 'normal', 'was', 'were', 'adamantly', 'trying', 'simply', 'touch', 'Ali', 'face', 'Liston', 'could', 'not', 'land', 'punishing', 'blows', 'Ali', 'head', '3', 'previous', 'rounds', 'could', 'barley', 'touch', 'Ali', 'eyes', 'objective', 'would', 'be', 'accomplished', 'was', 'not', 'shy', 'blatantly', 'trying', 'Round', 'five-The', 'so', 'called', 'bind', 'round', 'most', 'awesome', 'proof', 'Liston', 'was', 'trying', 'blind', 'Ali', 'mainly', 'again', 'abandoned', 'body', 'attack', 'believing', 'would', 'knock', 'out', 'Muhammad', 'Ali', 'round', '5', 'Ali', 'eyes', 'cleared', 'slow', 'down', 'disc', '56', 'seconds', 'left', 'round', 'Ali', 'left', 'as', 'light', 'day', 'glove', 'Liston', 'bloated', 'face', 'most', 'rest', 'round', 'can', 'see', 'telling', 'Liston', 'something', 'paying', 'Liston', 'back', 'K.O', 'solution', 'slang', 'anti', 'cut', 'cream', 'was', 'soon', 'afterwords', 'banned', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'Liston', 'coming', 'out', '6th', 'round', 'was', 'essentially', 'bruised', 'blinded', 'Liston', 'Ali', 'facial', 'smearing', 'previous', 'round', 'trying', 'retain', 'pride', 'bullies', 'get', 'what', 'give', 'Ali', 'world', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'facial', 'smearing', 'Muhammad', 'Ali', 'gave', 'Sonny', 'Liston', 'last', '56', 'seconds', 'round', '5', 'have', 'researched', 'fight', 'here', 'video', 'almost', '15', 'minutes', 'post', 'fight', 'footage', 'not', 'documentary', 'have', 'seen.The', 'Rumble', 'Jungle', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'other', 'video', 'two', 'points', 'will', 'make', 'are', 'George', 'Foreman', 'auto', 'biography', 'George', 'was', 'drugged', 'believe', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'fighter', 'such', 'glassy', 'eyes', 'just', 'being', 'tired', 'O.K.-He', 'did', ""n't"", 'train', 'relaxed', 'air', 'conditioning', 'Muhammad', 'Ali', 'acclimated', 'harsh', 'heat', 'even', 'Thriller', 'Manila', 'fighters', 'were', 'tired', 'only', 'time', 'have', 'seen', 'glassy', 'eyes', 'Foreman', 'had', 'last', '3', 'rounds', 'when', 'knock', 'out', 'punch', 'administered', 'second', 'observation', 'was', 'commentary', 'was', 'provided', 'David', 'Frost', 'Jim', 'Brown', 'Joe', 'Frazier', 'was', 'interesting', 'Joe', 'Frazier', 'had', 'just', 'lost', 'title', 'Foreman', 'was', 'verbally', 'bitter', 'towards', 'Ali', 'Also', 'David', 'Frost', 'was', 'just', 'stating', 'obvious', 'Jim', 'Brown', 'was', 'right', 'money', 'telling', 'team', 'Muhammad', 'Ali', 'was', 'smart', 'go', 'ropes', 'Frazier', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'post', 'fight', 'interview', 'contained', 'footage', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'have', 'fight', 'E.S.P.N', 'release', 'not', 'contain', 'Ali', 'lecturing', 'fans', 'never', 'bet', 'very', 'interesting.I', 'suggest', 'DVD', 'not', 'more', 'cost', 'other', 'fight', 'film']",N/A

43824,A1EBJ93E1T50RT,078311589X,Jason A. Miller,"[49, 50]","This is the genuine Muhammad Ali.  I was hesitant to purchase this DVD at first, because with its flimsy cardboard box it seemed a quickie release.  What tipped the balance for me was the HBO logo on the box -- produced to their boxing division's highest quality, this is a real winner.The 1964 Liston-Clay fight in Miami has already become legend, even though the fight itself lasts just six rounds.  Here on disc, with every second preserved, is Clay's taunting the champ, then momentarily losing his vision (did Liston rub liniment on his gloves?).  Shockingly, Liston quits on his stool before Round 7, and Clay shouting into the camera, &quot;I'm a bad man!  I shook up the world!  I shook up the world!&quot;.  No actor sincehas been able to recreate the rawness of this moment.  Presented on DVD is the closed-circuit theater version of the fight, called by Steve Ellis, with color commentary by Joe Louis in between rounds.  This is, of course, not Louis's finest hour.Next is Foreman-Ali in Zaire in October, 1974.  Notable here are the color commentators:  Ali friend and former football star Jim Brown, and longtime Ali rival (and, they say, bitter enemy) Joe Frazier, along with the obnoxious David Frost.  The fight itself is also the stuff of legend (and an Oscar-winning documentary).  Ali invents the &quot;rope-a-dope&quot; seemingly on the fly, and wins the fight without ever seeming hurt by massive George Foreman's punches.  The fact that 20 years later, Foreman would be champ and Ali would be seriously impaired, adds only a bittersweet irony to the finale.The final fight is Ali-Frazier III in Manila, the Thrilla in its entirety.  Along for the commentary ride are entertainers Hugh &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; O'Brian, and Flip Wilson -- whose presence at ringside is revealed only by his repeated assertion that &quot;Frazier is starting to smoke now!&quot;.  Most interesting, former Ali rival Ken Norton delivers an excellent blow-by-blow analysis for lead man Don Dunphy.If you know Ali, you've seen these fights already, but the DVD presents a unique digital opportunity to examine them again, punch by punch, word by word, from ringside ceremonies to Ali's impromptu post-bout conferences (the world has missed his repeated use of the word &quot;Moose-lim&quot;).  I could question the decision to remove most of the original TV graphics and impose a running clock over every second of every round of every fight, but these digital additions help more than they harm.The menus are simple and easy to navigate.  The key extras here are the fighter biographies (of Ali, Foreman, Frazier, Liston, and also Archie Moore and Larry Holmes), and subtitles.  This latter addition makes it easier to make out what the analysts are shouting over the action, particularly Louis and Dunphy.The final feature is a 1981 documentary, produced by HBO in the days before they were famous for that sort of thing.  It's a walk through Louisville, Kentucky, illustrated by some footage, but mostly still photos of, Ali's matches from pro debut to brutal beating at the hands of Larry Holmes.  The hour seems more a space-filler on an already packed DVD, and predates both Ali's final defeat at the hands of Trevor Berbick, and ascendancy to global icon status in the '90s.  However, you'll enjoy the dated '81 graphics and soundtrack.",5,&quot;I must be the greatest!&quot;,1017014400,"03 25, 2002",2002,3341,"['genuine', 'Muhammad', 'Ali', 'was', 'hesitant', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'first', 'flimsy', 'cardboard', 'box', 'seemed', 'quickie', 'release', 'What', 'tipped', 'balance', 'was', 'HBO', 'logo', 'box', 'produced', 'boxing', 'division', 'highest', 'quality', 'real', 'winner.The', '1964', 'Liston-Clay', 'fight', 'Miami', 'already', 'become', 'legend', 'even', 'fight', 'just', 'six', 'rounds', 'Here', 'disc', 'second', 'preserved', 'Clay', 'taunting', 'champ', 'then', 'momentarily', 'losing', 'vision', 'did', 'Liston', 'rub', 'liniment', 'gloves', 'Shockingly', 'Liston', 'stool', 'Round', '7', 'Clay', 'shouting', 'camera', 'quot', ""'m"", 'bad', 'man', 'shook', 'up', 'world', 'shook', 'up', 'world', 'quot', 'actor', 'sincehas', 'been', 'able', 'recreate', 'rawness', 'moment', 'Presented', 'DVD', 'closed-circuit', 'theater', 'version', 'fight', 'called', 'Steve', 'Ellis', 'color', 'commentary', 'Joe', 'Louis', 'rounds', 'course', 'not', 'Louis', 'finest', 'hour.Next', 'Foreman-Ali', 'Zaire', 'October', '1974.', 'Notable', 'here', 'are', 'color', 'commentators', 'Ali', 'friend', 'former', 'football', 'star', 'Jim', 'Brown', 'longtime', 'Ali', 'rival', 'say', 'bitter', 'enemy', 'Joe', 'Frazier', 'obnoxious', 'David', 'Frost', 'fight', 'also', 'stuff', 'legend', 'Oscar-winning', 'documentary', 'quot', 'rope-a-dope', 'quot', 'seemingly', 'fly', 'fight', 'ever', 'seeming', 'hurt', 'massive', 'George', 'Foreman', 'punches', 'fact', '20', 'years', 'later', 'Foreman', 'would', 'be', 'champ', 'Ali', 'would', 'be', 'seriously', 'impaired', 'only', 'bittersweet', 'irony', 'finale.The', 'final', 'fight', 'Ali-Frazier', 'III', 'Manila', 'Thrilla', 'entirety', 'commentary', 'ride', 'are', 'entertainers', 'Hugh', 'quot', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'quot', ""O'Brian"", 'Flip', 'Wilson', 'presence', 'ringside', 'revealed', 'only', 'repeated', 'assertion', 'quot', 'Frazier', 'starting', 'smoke', 'now', 'quot', 'Most', 'interesting', 'former', 'Ali', 'rival', 'Ken', 'Norton', 'excellent', 'blow-by-blow', 'analysis', 'lead', 'man', 'Don', 'Dunphy.If', 'know', 'Ali', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'fights', 'already', 'DVD', 'unique', 'digital', 'opportunity', 'examine', 'again', 'punch', 'punch', 'word', 'word', 'ringside', 'ceremonies', 'Ali', 'impromptu', 'post-bout', 'conferences', 'world', 'missed', 'repeated', 'use', 'word', 'quot', 'Moose-lim', 'quot', 'could', 'question', 'decision', 'remove', 'most', 'original', 'TV', 'graphics', 'impose', 'running', 'clock', 'second', 'round', 'fight', 'digital', 'additions', 'help', 'more', 'harm.The', 'menus', 'are', 'simple', 'easy', 'navigate', 'key', 'extras', 'here', 'are', 'fighter', 'biographies', 'Ali', 'Foreman', 'Frazier', 'Liston', 'also', 'Archie', 'Moore', 'Larry', 'Holmes', 'subtitles', 'latter', 'addition', 'easier', 'make', 'out', 'what', 'analysts', 'are', 'shouting', 'action', 'particularly', 'Louis', 'Dunphy.The', 'final', 'feature', '1981', 'documentary', 'produced', 'HBO', 'days', 'were', 'famous', 'sort', 'thing', 'walk', 'Louisville', 'Kentucky', 'illustrated', 'footage', 'mostly', 'still', 'photos', 'Ali', 'matches', 'pro', 'debut', 'brutal', 'beating', 'hands', 'Larry', 'Holmes', 'hour', 'more', 'space-filler', 'already', 'packed', 'DVD', 'Ali', 'final', 'defeat', 'hands', 'Trevor', 'Berbick', 'ascendancy', 'global', 'icon', 'status', ""'90s"", 'However', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'dated', 'graphics', 'soundtrack']",N/A

You get Clay vs. Liston I , Ali vs. Foreman , and , what is considered one of the best and most grueling boxing matches ever , Ali vs. Frazier III ; The Thrilla in Manilla. You also get  the one hour tribute to Ali called &quot;Boxings Best:Muhammad Ali&quot;. Some other VHS copies of these fights only give you the rounds fought with limited pre and post fight footage. Here in this DVD you see all fights in their entirety from the pre-fight footage to ring walks to between round footage to post fight footage. Jim Lampley is your host but you only see him before and after all three of the classic programs , which is great , and its all courtesy of HBO Sports. It , also , comes with a CD-Rom called &quot;The Ali Influence&quot;.Each round is split up as chapters which allows you to go straight to a favorite round. You will get the inconsistencies and flaws unique to the original sources of footage , otherwise , you get top digital performance from this DVD. These are pretty clear copies of the fights. Now that these fights are on DVD a fan can now analize these fights further by freeze framing and slow motioning the fights to see fighting techniques , punches landed , etc.In Clay-Liston 1 you see at the end of the fight that Howard Cosell was the first announcer to get to Clay but the mother of all post fight interviews was saved for announcers Steve Ellis and Joe Louis when Clay shouts &quot;I Shook Up The Word!&quot; almost shouting Ellis through the ropes. Its so funny to see Ellis struggling to maintain decorum while bedlam broke out and Clay was shouting his famous words. You see the whole post fight segment up to Clay leaving the ring. Post fight interviews would never be the same after that. It was historical and funny.In Ali-Foreman you see the ring walk of Ali and the ring &quot;run&quot; of Foreman. Before buying this DVD I never knew when after Ali entered the ring that Foreman made him wait about 7 minutes in the ring. You see all 7 minutes here and the entire pre fight ceremony. After the fight you see the celebration not only in the ring but also in the dressing room. You see Ali pointing straight into the camera and shouting down the critics who picked him to lose. Remember that Ali's title was taken away from him for not fighting in Vietnam because of his religious beliefs. So after about a 3 year exile from boxing , his return to boxing , his struggle to regain the championship after losing to Frazier and Ken Norton(Norton breaking his jaw) , critics saying that he's old , washed up , and a joke , then beating Frazier and Norton in 2 long fights , and to finally win back the title he was stripped of in his prime 7 long years earlier , against a man who many people thought was going to destroy Ali was a monumental achievement for Ali. It was the epitome of perseverance. In this post fight interview you see all of the fustration and anger from those 7 years and happiness from finally getting his title back come out because he proved to the world that he was the true king of the heavyweights.  It is footage that is rarely shown completely and the interview is shown right up to Ali chanting &quot;Louisville is the greatest!&quot;.So if you have a DVD player and you are a Muhammad Ali fan then you must get this DVD. Clay-Liston I , The Rumble in the Jungle , The Thrilla in Manilla , a tribute to Ali , all on one DVD and an Ali CD-Rom.
