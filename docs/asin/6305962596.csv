This movie is an incredible feat of cinematography and likely the best horse riding scenes ever filmed.  However, the real travesty is that the U.S. release is not digitally remastered and the sound track is just 2.0.  The sequel is even worse, as it was not released in it's original aspect ratio of 2.35:1, rather it's pan and scanned to make it fit the standard TV ratio of 1.33:1.  Since I am a huge fan, I really wanted to see these movies the way they were meant to be.  And there is a solution out there, if you are like me.  There was a digitally remastered DVD of both Snowy River I and II with Dolby 5.1 and DTS 5.1 in their OAR released in Australia.

485156,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,6305962596,Andre Dursin,"[1, 1]","This enchanting western, an expansion of the A.B. (""Banjo"") Paterson poem from writers John Dixon and Fred Cul Cullen, was one of the most successful Australian productions of the `80s. Director George Miller (the ""other one"" of ""Neverending Story"" fame) fashioned a stirring adventure with Tom Burlinson as a young man from the Australian highlands who has to prove his mettle to rancher Kirk Douglas after the death of his father. Burlinson falls for Douglas' daughter (Sigrid Thornton) while trying to retrieve his steed, who joined the ""brumbies,"" a collection of stampeding horses who roam the countryside.Gorgeously shot, ""The Man From Snowy River"" is a romantic, old-fashioned film with a beautiful score by Bruce Rowland that supports every aspect of the picture. This is a decided throwback to the genre's early days - not a revisionist western - and on that level, nearly every aspect of the movie works. Burlinson and Thornton are likeable and generate sufficient chemistry, and even though Douglas and fellow top-billed cast member Jack Thompson were mostly added for name value, their performances are likewise amiable (Douglas in a dual role that was later recast - with Brian Dennehy - in the 1988 sequel ""Return to Snowy River"").Fox's 1080p AVC encoded Blu-Ray transfer is just spectacular as well: crisp, detailed, and perfectly rendered. In fact, I'd go so far to say this is one of the best catalog discs I've seen in the last couple of years. The 2.0 DTS MA soundtrack is a bit problematic with sound effects that frequently overwhelm the dialogue, but it's still acceptable. The original trailer is the sole extra.",5,Marvelous Western and a Spectacular Blu-Ray,1337212800,"05 17, 2012",2012,1635,"['enchanting', 'western', 'expansion', 'A.B', 'Banjo', 'Paterson', 'poem', 'writers', 'John', 'Dixon', 'Fred', 'Cul', 'Cullen', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'successful', 'Australian', 'productions', '80s', 'Director', 'George', 'Miller', 'other', 'one', 'Neverending', 'Story', 'fame', 'fashioned', 'stirring', 'adventure', 'Tom', 'Burlinson', 'young', 'man', 'Australian', 'highlands', 'who', 'prove', 'mettle', 'rancher', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'death', 'father', 'Burlinson', 'Douglas', 'daughter', 'Sigrid', 'Thornton', 'trying', 'retrieve', 'steed', 'who', 'joined', 'brumbies', 'collection', 'stampeding', 'horses', 'who', 'roam', 'countryside.Gorgeously', 'shot', 'Man', 'Snowy', 'River', 'romantic', 'old-fashioned', 'film', 'beautiful', 'score', 'Bruce', 'Rowland', 'aspect', 'picture', 'decided', 'throwback', 'genre', 'early', 'days', 'not', 'revisionist', 'western', 'level', 'nearly', 'aspect', 'movie', 'Burlinson', 'Thornton', 'are', 'likeable', 'generate', 'sufficient', 'chemistry', 'even', 'Douglas', 'fellow', 'top-billed', 'cast', 'member', 'Jack', 'Thompson', 'were', 'mostly', 'added', 'name', 'value', 'performances', 'are', 'likewise', 'amiable', 'Douglas', 'dual', 'role', 'was', 'later', 'recast', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', '1988', 'sequel', 'Return', 'Snowy', 'River', '.Fox', '1080p', 'AVC', 'encoded', 'Blu-Ray', 'transfer', 'just', 'spectacular', 'as', 'well', 'crisp', 'detailed', 'perfectly', 'rendered', 'fact', ""'d"", 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'one', 'best', 'catalog', 'discs', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'last', 'couple', 'years', '2.0', 'DTS', 'MA', 'soundtrack', 'bit', 'problematic', 'sound', 'effects', 'frequently', 'overwhelm', 'dialogue', 'still', 'acceptable', 'original', 'trailer', 'sole', 'extra']",The Man From Snowy River VHS

485165,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,6305962596,Bobby Underwood,"[4, 4]","This film is just as wonderful today as it was at the time of its release. A terrific story of an old romantic rivalry, a legendary wild horse, and a young man from the high country is played out against the rugged but gorgeous Australian landscape. It is cinematically beautiful, dark silhouettes of horses and two people falling in love captured in front of the orange and blue hues of the majestic plains.Tom Burlinson is great as the young man trying to earn his right to live in the high country after a legendary horse named Stallion causes his father's death in a stampede. Kirk Douglass has a dual role here as Tom's friend, a crusty but lovable miner who has been working the same claim for years, and his brother, a rich cattle rancher he goes to work for.Sigrid Thornton is beautiful as the daughter of the rancher, her dead mother being the key to the long years of hatred between he and his brother. Burlinson and Thornton begin an innocent but very real romance cemented when he saves her life in a storm. Her father, of course, is against it, but Tom's chance to prove himself comes when an expensive colt who may have ties to Stallion gets loose and starts running with the wild Brombies.This is a beautiful and romantic saga that has an ending full of hope, which is really only a beginning. It is grand adventure and sterling entertainment that everyone in the family can enjoy. The romance between Burlinson and Thornton is old-fashioned and charming. The action sequences, especially the chase of a wild herd through the high mountains and snow, are beautifully filmed. There are fine performances in this adventure and it will hold a special place in your heart once you see it.

Yes, I am Australian, and love my country, however this movie includes fantastic cinematography, beautiful scenery (which is just as it is in the movie!), great acting, and a clean, yet exciting storyline.The story comprises of a mountain man who is left with a challenge to leave his mountain hut, and work on the flats, in order to be able to keep his mountain place. Of course, there is great antagonism between flats and mountain country folk. Jim Craig (played by Tom Burlinson) ends up falling in love with his boss's daughter, so thereby  finds himself working for more than just the humble hut he wishes to keep in the mountain country! Great horsework, awesome action, stunning scenery, what more can I say except - see for yourself!

485177,A3UUGZRTBS81YN,6305962596,David W. Jones,"[3, 3]","The Man from Snowy River is one of my all-time favorite movies.  It has everything--an interesting story, a beautiful setting, colorful characters and a script where every line sparkles, either deepening the characters or else advancing the plot.  Set in rural Australia in the late 1800s, it tells the story of a young mountain man who must go down to the plains in order to make a living.  In the process, he makes the transition to full manhood.The blu-ray transfer is acceptable.  On the positive side, the level of detail is good--much sharper than a DVD--which is what you want with a movie that has spectacular cinematography like this one.  You can see individual strands of hair and blades of grass.  Blacks are deep, and blues stand out.  On the negative side, however, there is considerable film grain in lower light shots.  And some of the brighter day shots look a bit washed out; they would have benefitted from a bit more color saturation.  Nevertheless, this is still a considerable upgrade from the DVD version.  If you love this film, you will want this version of it.Parental Advisory: This film is quite tame by modern standards.  There is some mild language, a couple of accidents where people are hurt, and a minor plot element involving suspected adultery.  There is also a fist fight, and a couple of kissing scenes.  Most parents would find this movie acceptable for their school-aged children.Unfortunately, this edition contains no special features other than the original trailer.As mentioned above, The Man from Snowy River is one of my all-time favorite films.  It is a must-see, especially in this blu-ray edition.  Perhaps one day the studio will digitally remaster and restore it, giving us a pristine verison of the film.

485178,A27ZOCD5B63Y0P,6305962596,"D. Collier ""Shelf-Help""","[1, 1]","THE MAN FROM SNOWY RIVER has earned its place as a unique and inspiring Western.  It was the first Western I ever saw at the cinema (I was about 7 years old at the time), and I saw it at a time in my life when all I was interested in were spaceships and lightsabers.I recently watched it again for the first time in many, many years.  Once again, the mystically poetic music captured my attention as did the beautiful Australian scenery.  But also for the first time, I noticed one of the strong core themes of this movie: stay focused on the goal and keep going.  That's what the hero, Jim Craig, does all throughout the film.  Even in times of hardship, unfairness, and heartbreak, he always keeps his virtue and courage fully intact.  My favorite--and probably everyone else's favorite--scene is where he keeps chasing the horses (or ""Brumbies"") down the steep mountainside even after the older and more experiences horsemen gave up.  Given the kind of determination and rigid focus that Jim Craig had, I think he would have ridden down that mountain even if it were on fire!This is one of many things that make this film great.  And once again, I will add that the music is wonderful.  ""Jessica's Sonata"" has now become one of the most recognizable piano pieces, even though many people would not know where it originated from.  It's the kind of music that stays with you long after you've seen the movie.",5,One of those Give-it-all-you-got and Throw-caution-to-the-wind kind of stories,1259539200,"11 30, 2009",2009,1409,"['MAN', 'FROM', 'SNOWY', 'RIVER', 'earned', 'place', 'unique', 'inspiring', 'Western', 'was', 'first', 'Western', 'ever', 'saw', 'cinema', 'was', '7', 'years', 'old', 'time', 'saw', 'time', 'life', 'when', 'was', 'interested', 'were', 'spaceships', 'lightsabers.I', 'recently', 'watched', 'again', 'first', 'time', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'Once', 'again', 'mystically', 'poetic', 'music', 'captured', 'attention', 'did', 'beautiful', 'Australian', 'scenery', 'also', 'first', 'time', 'noticed', 'one', 'strong', 'core', 'themes', 'movie', 'stay', 'focused', 'goal', 'keep', 'going', 'what', 'hero', 'Jim', 'Craig', 'film', 'Even', 'times', 'hardship', 'unfairness', 'heartbreak', 'always', 'virtue', 'courage', 'fully', 'intact', 'favorite', 'probably', 'everyone', 'else', 'favorite', 'scene', 'where', 'chasing', 'horses', 'Brumbies', 'steep', 'mountainside', 'even', 'older', 'more', 'experiences', 'horsemen', 'gave', 'up', 'Given', 'kind', 'determination', 'rigid', 'focus', 'Jim', 'Craig', 'had', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'ridden', 'down', 'mountain', 'even', 'were', 'fire', 'one', 'many', 'things', 'make', 'film', 'great', 'once', 'again', 'will', 'add', 'music', 'wonderful', 'Jessica', 'Sonata', 'now', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'recognizable', 'piano', 'pieces', 'even', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'not', 'know', 'where', 'originated', 'kind', 'music', 'long', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie']",The Man From Snowy River VHS

For pure romance, feel... everything, it's one of my few favorite romantic movies and I don't watch a lot of them. It's beautiful to look at - the scenery is incredible, the characters are deep and well-developed. Horse people are the greatest people my brother used to say. You can see it in this movie, a tough, gentle, passionate feel. Jessica and her strong guardian, the tough feminist reformer that reminds me of old America (though it's Australian here), clashing with her strong-willed father over love. Jim is the young ranch hand who grew up in a rough mountain environment, grieving over his father's death, trying to earn his way, and is now working on her father's farm. He's also willful and tough and has big dreams. Their personalities are alike and they seem bound to clash or love each other. The people here are tough like the land and it all comes together in a grand, sweeping romance. The music is incredibly beautiful - I was inspired to learn the Snowy River theme on the piano and used to love to play bits of it. I still get a great feel from the scene where they train the stallion together as pictured on the cover. Strong, good people who love and endure. Everything about this movie reminds me of home and all I loved about it. If you grew up on a farm or ranch, around animals and prairies, this will ease your homesickness, or celebrate your love if you still live there.

Actor Tom Burlinson plays Jim Craig, a mountain boy from the Victorian Alps of Australia. Ever since his mother died he had been living with his father, Henry Craig (Terence Donovan). But when Henry is killed, Jim must go down to the flat lands to find a job so that he can keep up his place. Since Jim's horse, Bess, had joined the wild Brunby horses lead by the 'black stallion', a good friend Spur (Kirk Douglas) gives him a mountain horse, Denny. When he reaches the flat lands, he is hired by rich and powerful Mr. Harrison (also played by Kirk Douglas) as a stable hand. Though because he is a mountain boy and everyone says away from him, some even openingly making fun of him like Curly (Chris Haywood), Jim makes friends with the lovely daughter of Jessica Harrison (Sigrid Thornton). They begin to fall in love but when a dark and long kept secret involving the Harrisons is brought up, will they still be able to be together? And will Jim be able to prove himself not as a lad, but as a man... a man from Snowy River?As a Hollywood Reporter quoted, &quot;A movie for the eyes as well as the heart,&quot; I most certainly agree with him! The Australian mountains are beautiful and breath-taking. There is not one place that you would want to skip or fast forward. And besides that, you have action and adventure, romance, magnificent horses, and absolutely terrific acting. Though Tom Burlinson and Sigrid Thornton are perfect for the part of the two lovers, the person who really shone in his role was veteran actor Kirk Douglas. He was wonderful and it must have been fun for him to play two parts in the movie.There is also a sequel to this movie, &quot;Return to Snowy River&quot; in which Jim Craig returns to Snowy River after a few years. But many things have changed, but does that mean that Jessica's love for him has changed? Another marvelous movie though I was somewhat disappointed that instead of Kirk Douglad playing Harrison, they had Brian Dennehy play the part.

485244,A281NPSIMI1C2R,6305962596,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[54, 58]","The rural grazing life in the Snowy Mountains has hardly changed since Banjo Paterson traveled the high country and wrote his famous ""Man from Snowy River"" poem. His poetry is an authentic voice of a frontier society in which song and campfire recitation were much appreciated entertainment.""And the Snowy River riders on the mountains make their home,Where the river runs those giant hills between;I have seen full many horsemen since I first commenced to roam,But nowhere yet such horsemen have I seen.""Andrew Barton Paterson was born in New South Wales and was the son of a Scottish immigrant. Paterson was a poet, journalist, lawyer, jockey, soldier, farmer and one of the best-loved figures of Australian literature. His poem is the basis for this gorgeous movie about the treacherous terrain and bands of wild, stampeding horses. He also wrote Waltzing Matilda, which is lovingly woven into the soundtrack.The Man from Snowy River Movie tells a more in depth story of a cattle baron Mr. Harrison (Jessica's father) who has had a long quarrel with his brother Spur. Kirk Douglas plays both roles. When one brother finds his fortune, the second goes searching for gold. This is a story based on a time when families tended their sheep and cattle. Ghost towns from the gold rush still haunt the landscape.Set against the untamed Australian Outback, a love story unfolds between Jessica Harrison ( Sigrid Thornton) and Jim Craig (Tom Burlinson). Jim seems to have a way with horses and Jessica is a bit of a brash filly herself.She has her own ideas regarding a woman's choices in life and choosing the path she will take in her own career. She defies her father and runs off to find Jim. Her anger towards Jim over a horse riding accident is like a summer storm that quickly disappears once she experiences the excitement of forbidden love.Her father, Mr. Harrison, has not yet learned that there is a beautiful place inside each person where we are either nurtured or destroyed. He seems emotionally destructive and Jessica rebels because he won't let her follow any of her dreams. He seeks to trap her in his own wishes and thinks she should settle down into a domestic lifestyle.Jim and Jessica are soul mates with hearts as wild as the horses running free through the snow. While at first they fight their mutual attraction, Jessica seems clearer in her thinking after she almost dies and realizes there are just some things in life worth fighting for.Equestrian Heaven with an impressive conclusion! You must see this movie once in your life if you love horses.

Pair that with a unique, lilting soundtrack, and it's a picture that is surely qualified to take it's rightful place among the Classics; and while it is not about the American West, it is as wild and beautiful, possessing all the qualities of the best of the best Western movies.Like the ""Mountain Mahogany, a hardwood shrub that adapts to grow in the harsh environment of a high country, so are the characters of each of the prominent players in this film.  The story is about the complex relationships between strong people sharing same blood but possessing vastly different personalities, goals, values; and the destined entry of another, newer strain of blood, equally strong - as nature brings out her master plan for the family.  A successful Australian rancher and his crusty, rough and tumble gold miner brother, both up to their ears in what motivates them, more alike than not, yet poles apart due to the conceptions they have of each other's lives and what has transpired there.  A beautiful, willful and headstrong daughter of one brother, whose birthright is under a cloud of suspicion by her equally stubborn father, fired by unreasonable jealousy of his wife and his brother - Kirk Douglas takes on the dual role of both;  and a young mountain lad, played by Tom Burlinson, sharp, responsible, capable, coming into his own and ready to prove it to those who will respect him for what he is - a gem in the making and not necessarily all that rough around the edges, either.Supporting the superb entertainment value of this movie and it's human element, the photography is simply outstanding.  Shots of pale evening skies, silhouettes of the young lovers with the horses against the horizon, all are evidence of the director's high degree of talent;  vast 360 views of high mountain scenery  - all serve to add a surreal dimension to the tale, drawing the viewer in.  It even comes complete with one highly unlikely and even impossible action ride down a perpendicular mountain cliff.During this ""coming of age"" quest for acceptance into a family he wants to provide the next generation through - but on his own merit and not on the back of someone else - the ""boy from the mountain"" becomes ""The Man From Snowy River"".",5,"""Mountain Mahogany""",1326326400,"01 12, 2012",2012,2327,"['magnificent', 'artistry', 'filming', 'direction', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'Pair', 'unique', 'lilting', 'soundtrack', 'picture', 'surely', 'qualified', 'take', 'rightful', 'place', 'Classics', 'not', 'American', 'West', 'wild', 'beautiful', 'possessing', 'qualities', 'best', 'best', 'Western', 'Mountain', 'Mahogany', 'hardwood', 'shrub', 'grow', 'harsh', 'environment', 'high', 'country', 'so', 'are', 'characters', 'prominent', 'players', 'film', 'story', 'complex', 'relationships', 'strong', 'people', 'sharing', 'same', 'blood', 'possessing', 'vastly', 'different', 'personalities', 'goals', 'values', 'destined', 'entry', 'newer', 'strain', 'blood', 'equally', 'strong', 'nature', 'out', 'master', 'plan', 'family', 'successful', 'Australian', 'rancher', 'crusty', 'rough', 'tumble', 'gold', 'miner', 'brother', 'up', 'ears', 'what', 'more', 'alike', 'not', 'yet', 'apart', 'due', 'conceptions', 'have', 'other', 'lives', 'transpired', 'there', 'beautiful', 'willful', 'headstrong', 'daughter', 'one', 'brother', 'birthright', 'cloud', 'suspicion', 'equally', 'stubborn', 'father', 'fired', 'unreasonable', 'jealousy', 'wife', 'brother', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'dual', 'role', 'young', 'mountain', 'lad', 'played', 'Tom', 'Burlinson', 'sharp', 'responsible', 'capable', 'coming', 'own', 'ready', 'prove', 'who', 'will', 'respect', 'what', 'gem', 'making', 'not', 'necessarily', 'rough', 'edges', 'either.Supporting', 'superb', 'entertainment', 'value', 'movie', 'human', 'element', 'photography', 'simply', 'outstanding', 'Shots', 'pale', 'evening', 'skies', 'silhouettes', 'young', 'lovers', 'horses', 'horizon', 'are', 'evidence', 'director', 'high', 'degree', 'talent', 'vast', '360', 'views', 'high', 'mountain', 'scenery', 'serve', 'add', 'surreal', 'dimension', 'tale', 'drawing', 'viewer', 'even', 'complete', 'one', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'even', 'impossible', 'action', 'ride', 'perpendicular', 'mountain', 'cliff.During', 'coming', 'age', 'quest', 'acceptance', 'family', 'provide', 'next', 'generation', 'own', 'merit', 'not', 'back', 'someone', 'else', 'boy', 'mountain', 'Man', 'Snowy', 'River']",The Man From Snowy River VHS

The story is a simple one that is popular in all countries. Unspoiled lad from the country becomes an orphan due to an accident involving a horse. He is quickly made to realize by the mountain men that he will have to toughen up a bit and then come back to make his way. He goes to the low country and starts looking for work . He runs into a crowd surrounding a horse and it's handler and ""rescues"" the handler from being trampled by the stallion. The handler turns out to be the lil firecracker of a daughter (jessica) to the local rich land baron. The story of how he becomes a noted horse handler derives from his working on the barons lands and falling in love with said firecracker. She is willful beautiful and determined to make her own path as much as he is . Watch this breath taking spectacle of a movie and enjoy some of the best horseback riding and scenery you have ever seen . The actors take back seat to it all but manage to hold their own. Kirk Douglas is in a dual role in this one as the Father and the uncle of Jessica. Watch and judge for yourself. This one is completely clean and suitable for all ages.

Each character, man, woman or horse, display the same strength of will and personality.  An independent Australian film, &quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot; has the unmistakable mark of personal vision and integrity.The story and themes are typical of Westerns; a poor boy from the mountains courts a wealthy man's daughter, the same boy seeks to prove himself as a man by succeeding where his father failed, an older man mentors the boy and sets him on the right path.  However, atypical of American Western films is the strength of the female characters, and the somber mood of the film.The acting is top-notch.  Kirk Douglas does a suprisingly good turn in a dual-role, playing the brothers Spur and Harrison.  (when I first saw the film I didn't realize that they were the same actor.)  Each actor fits his/her role perfectly.Of special note is the score.  I dare you not to get goose bumps during the finally, when the orchestra plays.Not many extras on this DVD, but a film this good doesn't really need them.  &quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot; remains one of my all-time favorite movies.
