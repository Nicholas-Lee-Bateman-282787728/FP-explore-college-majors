But don't fret people City Hunter is a very visual anime with regards to plot and humour - even if you're slow at reading you'll keep up with this.  Previous dubs have all been terrible changing Ryo's name to Joe anyway...Second the boxset features an introduction to words or phrases used in the show before each episode which really helps.Thirdly the music in this show is great (the later boxsets of the series gets even better) and fourth this boxset is great value for money - it's half the price of a season of Tenchi or Trigun and less than Ranma or Slayers too.There's no reason not to go after this boxset of the Mokkori maniac City Hunter's exploits.",5,Hunt this out,1063584000,"09 15, 2003",2003,849,"['First', 'off', 'series', 'Japanese', 'English', 'subtitles', 'best', 'thing', 'ADV', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'dub', 'would', 'capture', 'frequent', 'changes', 'tone', 'characters', 'use', 'do', ""n't"", 'fret', 'people', 'City', 'Hunter', 'very', 'visual', 'anime', 'regards', 'plot', 'humour', 'even', ""'re"", 'slow', 'reading', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'up', 'Previous', 'dubs', 'have', 'been', 'terrible', 'changing', 'Ryo', 'name', 'Joe', 'anyway', 'Second', 'boxset', 'introduction', 'words', 'phrases', 'used', 'show', 'episode', 'really', 'music', 'show', 'great', 'later', 'boxsets', 'series', 'even', 'better', 'fourth', 'boxset', 'great', 'value', 'money', 'price', 'season', 'Tenchi', 'Trigun', 'less', 'Ranma', 'Slayers', 'reason', 'not', 'go', 'boxset', 'Mokkori', 'maniac', 'City', 'Hunter', 'exploits']",N/A

751456,A2TVEOIRFB2PBX,B000093NPX,Frank,"[0, 0]","I stumbled onto City Hunter thinking it would be a gritty thriller in the vein of &#34;The Chaser&#34; or &#34;Old Boy&#34; as I had just gotten into these Korean crime flicks and this was recommended. The first episode was promising, setting up an epic saga of power, corruption, betrayal, and revenge--but even in this one things turned pretty ridiculous fast. The setup: Lee Jin-pyo is the sole survivor of a botched attack on North Korea, but his colleagues weren't killed by the North, they were eliminated by the South who scuttled the mission midway. So what does Jin-pyo do? The logical thing of course: he kidnaps his fallen comrade's infant son (telling the widowed mother just to get on with her life), moves to Thailand, and becomes a drug kingin. He raises the boy, Lee Yun-seong, as his own, training him in martial arts, and sends him to Texas to get an advanced degree in technology. Then he unleashes this genius secret weapon to extract revenge on those who betrayed him so many years ago. Lee Yun-seong gets a job at a government security/technology firm (they seem to be a combination of the Secret Service and Microsoft) where he strikes up an antagonistic/romantic from afar with a young protection agent, Kim Nana. Meanwhile he reconnects with his mother, and plots revenge against the Korean power brokers who killed his real father with the help of Bae Man-duk, a man he saved his stepfather from executing back in Thailand.This sounds all very tense, but what this really is is a fantasy geared at teenage girls. The protagonist is almost prettier than the women in the show and completely implausible as a kickass secret agent (he sometimes wears a mask which is about as effective as the Lone Ranger mask or Clark Kent's glasses). The secret service agents, especially Kim Nana, look like they're just out of high school and they act, dress, and live like they are in junior high. The plots are driven by wild coinicidences (If Lee is innocently with another woman anywhere in the city of Seoul, you can bet that Kim Nana will be walking down the street at the same time, leading to a misunderstanding between two people who purport to not be able to stand each other anyway). And again, these are all supposed to be adults with high powered government security jobs, yet they argue and act like sixth graders who think the opposite sex is &#34;icky.&#34; Imagine if you will, Helen Mirren in Prime Suspect, with her hair in pigtails coming home to an apartment full of Hello Kitty paraphanalia. That's kind of the credibiltiy gap this show forces you to jump.So why four stars? Because everyone is very likeable, it is clean, silly fun, and I'm enjoying it as a guilty pleasure. To be sure, if this were  done with an American cast I'd probably hate it--but the Korean setting and culture differences make it interesting enough to enjoy. I'm abouto halfway through, I'll probably regret it when I'm done, but I'm enjoying spending time with this goofy, adolescent revenge tale.",4,"Crazy, preposterous, young adult fun",1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,3006,"['stumbled', 'City', 'Hunter', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'gritty', 'thriller', 'vein', '34', 'Chaser', '34', '34', 'Old', 'Boy', '34', 'had', 'just', 'gotten', 'Korean', 'crime', 'flicks', 'was', 'recommended', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'promising', 'setting', 'up', 'epic', 'saga', 'power', 'corruption', 'betrayal', 'revenge', 'even', 'one', 'things', 'turned', 'pretty', 'ridiculous', 'fast', 'setup', 'Lee', 'Jin-pyo', 'sole', 'survivor', 'botched', 'attack', 'North', 'Korea', 'colleagues', 'were', ""n't"", 'killed', 'North', 'were', 'eliminated', 'South', 'who', 'scuttled', 'mission', 'midway', 'So', 'what', 'Jin-pyo', 'do', 'logical', 'thing', 'course', 'fallen', 'comrade', 'infant', 'son', 'telling', 'widowed', 'mother', 'just', 'get', 'life', 'moves', 'Thailand', 'drug', 'kingin', 'boy', 'Lee', 'Yun-seong', 'own', 'training', 'martial', 'arts', 'Texas', 'get', 'advanced', 'degree', 'technology', 'Then', 'genius', 'weapon', 'extract', 'revenge', 'who', 'betrayed', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'Lee', 'Yun-seong', 'job', 'government', 'security/technology', 'firm', 'seem', 'be', 'combination', 'Secret', 'Service', 'Microsoft', 'where', 'up', 'antagonistic/romantic', 'afar', 'young', 'protection', 'agent', 'Kim', 'Nana', 'Meanwhile', 'mother', 'plots', 'revenge', 'Korean', 'power', 'brokers', 'who', 'killed', 'real', 'father', 'help', 'Bae', 'Man-duk', 'man', 'saved', 'stepfather', 'executing', 'back', 'Thailand.This', 'very', 'tense', 'what', 'really', 'fantasy', 'geared', 'teenage', 'girls', 'protagonist', 'almost', 'prettier', 'women', 'show', 'completely', 'implausible', 'kickass', 'secret', 'agent', 'sometimes', 'mask', 'as', 'effective', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'mask', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'glasses', 'secret', 'service', 'agents', 'especially', 'Kim', 'Nana', 'look', ""'re"", 'just', 'high', 'school', 'act', 'dress', 'live', 'are', 'junior', 'high', 'plots', 'are', 'driven', 'wild', 'coinicidences', 'Lee', 'innocently', 'woman', 'anywhere', 'city', 'Seoul', 'can', 'bet', 'Kim', 'Nana', 'will', 'be', 'walking', 'street', 'same', 'time', 'leading', 'misunderstanding', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'purport', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'stand', 'other', 'anyway', 'again', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'adults', 'high', 'powered', 'government', 'security', 'jobs', 'yet', 'argue', 'act', 'sixth', 'graders', 'who', 'think', 'opposite', 'sex', '34', 'icky.', '34', 'Imagine', 'will', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Prime', 'Suspect', 'hair', 'pigtails', 'coming', 'home', 'apartment', 'full', 'Hello', 'Kitty', 'paraphanalia', 'kind', 'credibiltiy', 'gap', 'show', 'jump.So', 'why', 'four', 'stars', 'everyone', 'very', 'likeable', 'clean', 'silly', 'fun', ""'m"", 'enjoying', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'be', 'sure', 'were', 'done', 'American', 'cast', ""'d"", 'probably', 'hate', 'Korean', 'setting', 'culture', 'differences', 'make', 'interesting', 'enough', 'enjoy', ""'m"", 'abouto', 'halfway', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'regret', 'when', ""'m"", 'done', ""'m"", 'enjoying', 'spending', 'time', 'goofy', 'adolescent', 'revenge', 'tale']",N/A

751460,A12CUOYPW2QM91,B000093NPX,"Omar Khan ""RW""","[13, 15]","Author's Note: This is the same review for the first box set.  but seeing as how this a review for the whole first season, it would be stupid of me to re-write a whole review for such a sake.Now, allow me just this little bit of time to open to flood gates of my ego, I promise you I won't be long. When it comes to anime, I tend to think of myself as more learned than the average otaku. I mean, I've been around this anime block several times over the course of several years and I've seen several titles come and go, sometimes for the best. Then there are the familiar faces, you know them all, the ones that have been here longer than most, they know the game better than any recent title. And you're glad that you know them. ""City Hunter"" falls into this category. In short; this is (say it with me class) classic anime.Created in 1985 by famous manga-ka Tsukasa Hojo, the story focuses on Ryo Saeba, a ""sweeper"" (sort of an urban mercenary, or a...city hunter! Aha!) who takes on all sorts of dangerous jobs. A cool-as-ice fighter with marksmanship skills that could rival Vash the Stampede. With his .357 Colt Python, mini cooper, and a host of partners in the business, he's the man you call when you are out of options and desperately need the job done. It would help a lot more if you were a pretty woman though. You see, Ryo is what we like to call a ""sex-fiend,"" very much in the same vein as Golden Boy or Lupin III. Although Ryo works hard to get his man, he works even harder to get his woman. Which is both his skill and his undoing.The series was one of the better action animes to grace the screen when it first arrived circa 1987-88. The series enjoyed mass appeal by the Japanese public. Hailed by many critics as ""The worthy succesor to Lupin III,"" the series went on to produce 100+ episodes, several movies, TV specials, and manga. The manga and the TV specials are available stateside and belong in any otakus collection. Right, now with that short history lesson over, let's move onto an actual review.""City Hunter"" is a fun series. However, like most series that go for 100 episodes, it doesn't follow one plot as it does several tiny stories. Most of these stories are great, some are good, and there's a small batch that is kinda boring. Luckily, since this DVD box features the first 26 episodes, repetition isn't given any time to settle in.The animation is a bit dated, but it really doesn't detract from the action or the story-telling of the series. The art is enjoybable because it manages to remain true to Hojo San's original drawings and maintains his style of story-telling. It might irk some newbie otakus, but that's how you seperate the ""men from the mice.""Speaking of action sequences, this anime has manged to combine all the best elements of some of the greatest action movies. From wild car chases to insane gun fights, every episode boasts its own thrill ride.The music is filled with an 80's kind of cool. Sort of ""Miami Vice"" but much better. This is 80's j-pop and j-rock, which is pretty much anykind of 80's music you can think of but with Japanese voices and lyrics.The characters are endearing and easily likable. Ryo and his cohorts in crime(?) all have this sense of sly coolness and unbridled siliness. A little bit of recognition has to go to Akira Kamiya, Ryo's voice actor. He has been hailed as one of the greatest male voice actors of any anime and his extensive list of characters include Piccolo in ""DragonBall,"" Kenshiro in ""Fist of the North Star,"" Shun in ""Maison Ikkoku,"" and Roy Fokker in ""Macross."" Just so you know.""City Hunter"" is a delight for any anime fan, old and new. It resonates with a timeless quality that few anime titles are imbued with today. And since ADV will be releasing future episodes of this classic series in similar box sets, you can tell it is a very good investment.In closing, spend a viewing with ""City Hunter"" and you will get way more bang for your buck.-RW",5,"Get Wild with ""City Hunter""",1059523200,"07 30, 2003",2003,3955,"['Author', 'Note', 'same', 'review', 'first', 'box', 'set', 'seeing', 'how', 'review', 'whole', 'first', 'season', 'would', 'be', 'stupid', 're-write', 'whole', 'review', 'such', 'sake.Now', 'allow', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'time', 'open', 'flood', 'gates', 'ego', 'promise', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'long', 'When', 'anime', 'tend', 'think', 'more', 'learned', 'average', 'otaku', 'mean', ""'ve"", 'been', 'anime', 'block', 'several', 'times', 'course', 'several', 'years', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'several', 'titles', 'come', 'go', 'sometimes', 'best', 'Then', 'are', 'familiar', 'know', 'ones', 'have', 'been', 'here', 'longer', 'most', 'know', 'game', 'better', 'recent', 'title', ""'re"", 'glad', 'know', 'City', 'Hunter', 'category', 'short', 'say', 'class', 'classic', 'anime.Created', '1985', 'famous', 'manga-ka', 'Tsukasa', 'Hojo', 'story', 'Ryo', 'Saeba', 'sweeper', 'sort', 'urban', 'mercenary', 'city', 'hunter', 'Aha', 'who', 'sorts', 'dangerous', 'jobs', 'cool-as-ice', 'fighter', 'marksmanship', 'skills', 'could', 'rival', 'Vash', 'Stampede', '.357', 'Colt', 'Python', 'mini', 'cooper', 'host', 'partners', 'business', 'man', 'call', 'when', 'are', 'options', 'desperately', 'need', 'job', 'done', 'would', 'help', 'lot', 'more', 'were', 'pretty', 'woman', 'see', 'Ryo', 'what', 'like', 'call', 'sex-fiend', 'very', 'much', 'same', 'vein', 'Golden', 'Boy', 'Lupin', 'III', 'Ryo', 'hard', 'get', 'man', 'even', 'harder', 'get', 'woman', 'Which', 'skill', 'undoing.The', 'series', 'was', 'one', 'better', 'action', 'animes', 'grace', 'screen', 'when', 'first', 'arrived', 'circa', '1987-88', 'series', 'enjoyed', 'mass', 'appeal', 'Japanese', 'public', 'Hailed', 'many', 'critics', 'worthy', 'succesor', 'Lupin', 'III', 'series', 'went', 'produce', '100+', 'episodes', 'several', 'movies', 'TV', 'specials', 'manga', 'manga', 'TV', 'specials', 'are', 'available', 'stateside', 'belong', 'otakus', 'collection', 'Right', 'now', 'short', 'history', 'lesson', 'let', 'move', 'actual', 'review', 'City', 'Hunter', 'fun', 'series', 'However', 'most', 'series', 'go', '100', 'episodes', ""n't"", 'follow', 'one', 'plot', 'several', 'tiny', 'stories', 'Most', 'stories', 'are', 'great', 'are', 'good', 'small', 'batch', 'kinda', 'boring', 'Luckily', 'DVD', 'box', 'first', '26', 'episodes', 'repetition', ""n't"", 'given', 'time', 'settle', 'in.The', 'animation', 'bit', 'dated', 'really', ""n't"", 'detract', 'action', 'story-telling', 'series', 'art', 'enjoybable', 'remain', 'true', 'Hojo', 'San', 'original', 'drawings', 'style', 'story-telling', 'might', 'irk', 'newbie', 'otakus', 'how', 'seperate', 'men', 'mice', 'Speaking', 'action', 'sequences', 'anime', 'manged', 'combine', 'best', 'elements', 'greatest', 'action', 'movies', 'wild', 'car', 'chases', 'insane', 'gun', 'fights', 'episode', 'own', 'thrill', 'ride.The', 'music', 'filled', '80', 'kind', 'cool', 'Sort', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'much', 'better', '80', 'j-pop', 'j-rock', 'pretty', 'much', '80', 'music', 'can', 'think', 'Japanese', 'voices', 'lyrics.The', 'characters', 'are', 'endearing', 'easily', 'likable', 'Ryo', 'cohorts', 'crime', 'have', 'sense', 'sly', 'coolness', 'unbridled', 'siliness', 'little', 'bit', 'recognition', 'go', 'Akira', 'Kamiya', 'Ryo', 'voice', 'actor', 'been', 'hailed', 'one', 'greatest', 'male', 'voice', 'actors', 'anime', 'extensive', 'list', 'characters', 'include', 'Piccolo', 'DragonBall', 'Kenshiro', 'Fist', 'North', 'Star', 'Shun', 'Maison', 'Ikkoku', 'Roy', 'Fokker', 'Macross', 'Just', 'so', 'know', 'City', 'Hunter', 'delight', 'anime', 'fan', 'old', 'new', 'timeless', 'quality', 'few', 'anime', 'titles', 'are', 'imbued', 'today', 'ADV', 'will', 'be', 'releasing', 'future', 'episodes', 'classic', 'series', 'similar', 'box', 'sets', 'can', 'tell', 'very', 'good', 'investment.In', 'closing', 'spend', 'viewing', 'City', 'Hunter', 'will', 'get', 'way', 'more', 'bang', 'buck.-RW']",N/A
