While this movie might not stand up to the comparisons, it's an enjoyable movie. It is not a deep movie full of drama and themes and full fledged life lessons. It is a nice enjoyable movie about camp and growing up and learning how to stand up and be counted when you need to be and that the Scout Oath means something.The scenes that you would expect to see in a movie about Scout camp are all there. The rifle master taking his job too seriously, the reverent flag ceremony, the fire building and so on. They were just enough over the top that anyone watching should be able to get the idea that while there might be some limited truth to the scenes- they are to be taken as a joke.This is an enjoyable movie. Funny at parts, poignent at times, but mostly just enjoyable.",5,Enjoyable.,1293753600,"12 31, 2010",2010,892,"['movie', 'drawn', 'critics', 'who', 'have', 'compared', 'previous', 'Scout', 'movies', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'past', 'movie', 'might', 'not', 'stand', 'up', 'comparisons', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'not', 'deep', 'movie', 'full', 'drama', 'themes', 'full', 'fledged', 'life', 'lessons', 'nice', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'camp', 'growing', 'up', 'learning', 'how', 'stand', 'up', 'be', 'counted', 'when', 'need', 'be', 'Scout', 'Oath', 'something.The', 'scenes', 'would', 'expect', 'see', 'movie', 'Scout', 'camp', 'are', 'there', 'rifle', 'master', 'taking', 'job', 'too', 'seriously', 'reverent', 'flag', 'ceremony', 'fire', 'building', 'so', 'were', 'just', 'enough', 'top', 'anyone', 'watching', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'idea', 'might', 'be', 'limited', 'truth', 'scenes-', 'are', 'be', 'taken', 'joke.This', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'Funny', 'parts', 'poignent', 'times', 'mostly', 'just', 'enjoyable']",Scout Camp

Do not buy this movie, even if it's on sale for 50 Cents with free shipping. That's not all, the package came in the mail late and destroyed. DVD case was smashed, not the postal service's fault. May as well have sent it with only postage for all the package was worth. Lucky the DVD was only scratched a little but still worked.

I have been involved with the Scout program for a number of years and I was surprised to see so many different personalities of Scouts represented in the film. And one scene hit a little close to home. I agree that a couple scenes could have been better acted, but overall I thought it was a fun family movie.",4,Fun movie about camp.,1262995200,"01 9, 2010",2010,407,"['enjoyed', 'Scout', 'Camp', 'Movie', 'Granted', 'not', 'big', 'budget', 'film', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'have', 'been', 'involved', 'Scout', 'program', 'number', 'years', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'personalities', 'Scouts', 'represented', 'film', 'one', 'scene', 'hit', 'little', 'close', 'home', 'agree', 'couple', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'acted', 'overall', 'thought', 'was', 'fun', 'family', 'movie']",Scout Camp
