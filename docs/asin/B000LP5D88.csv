On the other hand, I was expecting a lot less, and found myself entertained.  Yes, it's low-budget.  Yes, it's definately B-movie.  But if you're in the mood for such fare, then this will satisfy.Actually, I would give it 3.5 stars, but Joey - er JOSEPH Lawrence is awefully cute, so I'm rounding up.",4,Entertaining; on par with a Sci-fi Chanel original movie,1177632000,"04 27, 2007",2007,382,"['Look', 'ai', ""n't"", 'piece', 'art', 'big', 'budget', 'special', 'effects', 'feature', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'expecting', 'lot', 'less', 'found', 'entertained', 'Yes', 'low-budget', 'Yes', 'definately', 'B-movie', ""'re"", 'mood', 'such', 'fare', 'then', 'will', 'satisfy.Actually', 'would', 'give', '3.5', 'stars', 'Joey', 'er', 'JOSEPH', 'Lawrence', 'awefully', 'cute', ""'m"", 'rounding', 'up']",Android Apocalypse

The story itself seems to lack some continuity and flow, but overall it is very entertaining. Joseph Lawrence is extraordinarily believable as the android. I've always enjoyed his acting but he takes it to a new level here. A really solid cast keeps this from becoming predicable or boring.",4,unique story,1304467200,"05 4, 2011",2011,377,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'unique', 'storyline', 'casting', 'was', 'great', 'story', 'lack', 'continuity', 'flow', 'overall', 'very', 'entertaining', 'Joseph', 'Lawrence', 'extraordinarily', 'believable', 'android', ""'ve"", 'always', 'enjoyed', 'acting', 'new', 'level', 'here', 'A', 'really', 'solid', 'cast', 'keeps', 'becoming', 'predicable', 'boring']",Android Apocalypse

1039664,A28GCEHD00JFZG,B000LP5D88,Julian Kennedy,"[2, 3]","Android Apocalypse: 4 out of 10: Well it did not make me want to poke my eyes out with a dull fork... so it has that going in its favor.Dateline the future... Phoenix is a domed city surrounded by a horrifying wasteland. (Kind of like now) Humans are in short supply so androids that look exactly like humans do most of the work. Our mullet wearing racist (androidist?) hero loses his shoveling things job to an android. A few eighties flashback fistfights later and he finds himself on the run through the wasteland handcuffed to an android. (Joey Lawrence of Blossom of all people.)The leads are actually quite good and it is unusual for white trash to be a hero in these (or any) type of films. That is a nice change of pace. The story on the other hand is pretty awful. For example the ending is so truncated they either ran out of money or forgot the whole apocalypse promise of the title.While Lawrence does his best data impersonation, the other androids are all over the map. Many of them emote more than their human counterparts, while others are clearly the same five grips wearing facemasks.Set design also needs work. The prison is clearly a factory. The humans headquarters is a glorified office park complete with fernage. (I was having Overdrawn at the Memory Bank flashbacks) In addition, items such as blankets with do not remove tags and Jeep Cherokees litter the film.Overall a decent if slow Sci-fi time waster. Just do not get you hopes up for an apocalypse.",2,Android Apocalypse...

Then I found out Chris Jericho was in it and as he is one of my favorite wrestlers and I love his band Fozzy's music, I thought I give it a try. It's no Academy award winner, but I enjoyed it.

As with movies of science fiction one has to use his/her imagination which includes overlooking the overwhelming impossibilities of them (abilities, inventions, etc.).
