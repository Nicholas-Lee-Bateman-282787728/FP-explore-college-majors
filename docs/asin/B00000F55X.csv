The story is unsettling and problematic though.  In fairy tales or classic British novels, such as those by Jane Austen, a girl dreams of meeting and marrying her prince and finally does just that.  In this movie, Sybilla does meet her prince who falls in love with her, but she turns down ordinary human happiness to lead the life of an artist, whatever that may mean in her case.  She also turns down someone's true love - most people, unfortunately, can only wish they could find it and end up settling for a lot less.  I never actually read the book but, from watching a movie, I never got a sense that there was anything remotely brilliant about her career, or that she had talent that showed any promise.  Her personality is fun but not exactly appealing.  She is full of vitality yet excessively self-centered and, as she herself admits, egotistical.  She seems to have little or no consideration for others.  Harry Beacham, on the other hand, is very sympathetic.  He is an arrogant young man but that is expected of him - he is a prince-like figure.  He is still very likeable - aristocratic yet surprisingly understanding, given his sheltered existence, strong yet vulnerable.  He must have fallen for her because she was different from other girls he met.  She seems to have some feelings for him too, but she is too self-centered and preoccupied by self-introspection to actually love someone else.  In the end, she tells him that she ""almost"" loves him, or something like that, and that what she is really after is finding out who she is and what is wrong with the world.  Yeah, right.  I was somewhat like Sybilla when I was young (though I had a lot more concern and appreciation for people and things) and it took me many years to learn what is of true value in life.  The most profound and best line in the movie is ""loneliness is a high price to pay for independence"".  In the end, I felt sorry for Sybilla.  The decision not to marry Harry Beacham was something that she would probably regret later, as years would pass.  I could almost imagine Sybilla eventually turning into a lonely and bitter old hag, finding her only comfort in grumbling about everyone else being smug, stupid, bourgeois and conformist.",3,A Contrarian View,1133827200,"12 6, 2005",2005,2332,"['movie', 'exquisitely', 'styled', 'well-paced', 'filled', 'interesting', 'characters', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'story', 'unsettling', 'problematic', 'though', 'fairy', 'tales', 'classic', 'British', 'novels', 'such', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'girl', 'dreams', 'meeting', 'marrying', 'prince', 'finally', 'just', 'movie', 'Sybilla', 'meet', 'prince', 'who', 'love', 'down', 'ordinary', 'human', 'happiness', 'lead', 'life', 'artist', 'may', 'mean', 'case', 'also', 'down', 'someone', 'true', 'love', 'most', 'people', 'unfortunately', 'can', 'only', 'wish', 'could', 'find', 'end', 'up', 'settling', 'lot', 'less', 'never', 'actually', 'read', 'book', 'watching', 'movie', 'never', 'got', 'sense', 'was', 'anything', 'remotely', 'brilliant', 'career', 'had', 'talent', 'showed', 'promise', 'personality', 'fun', 'not', 'exactly', 'appealing', 'full', 'vitality', 'yet', 'excessively', 'self-centered', 'egotistical', 'have', 'little', 'consideration', 'others', 'Harry', 'Beacham', 'other', 'hand', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'arrogant', 'young', 'man', 'expected', 'prince-like', 'figure', 'still', 'very', 'likeable', 'aristocratic', 'yet', 'surprisingly', 'understanding', 'given', 'sheltered', 'existence', 'strong', 'yet', 'vulnerable', 'must', 'have', 'fallen', 'was', 'different', 'other', 'girls', 'met', 'have', 'feelings', 'too', 'too', 'self-centered', 'preoccupied', 'self-introspection', 'actually', 'love', 'someone', 'else', 'end', 'almost', 'something', 'what', 'really', 'finding', 'out', 'who', 'what', 'wrong', 'world', 'Yeah', 'right', 'was', 'somewhat', 'like', 'Sybilla', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'had', 'lot', 'more', 'concern', 'appreciation', 'people', 'things', 'took', 'many', 'years', 'learn', 'what', 'true', 'value', 'life', 'most', 'profound', 'best', 'line', 'movie', 'loneliness', 'high', 'price', 'pay', 'independence', 'end', 'felt', 'sorry', 'Sybilla', 'decision', 'not', 'marry', 'Harry', 'Beacham', 'was', 'something', 'would', 'probably', 'regret', 'later', 'years', 'would', 'pass', 'could', 'almost', 'imagine', 'Sybilla', 'eventually', 'turning', 'lonely', 'bitter', 'old', 'hag', 'finding', 'only', 'comfort', 'grumbling', 'everyone', 'else', 'being', 'smug', 'stupid', 'bourgeois', 'conformist']",My Brilliant Career VHS

I will say only that MY BRILLIANT CAREER is a beautifully written and photographed tale of a vivacious, independent young woman (Judy Davis) and the unrequited love of her suitor (Sam Neill). The characters are unforgettable and the love story complex. As a period piece, the film comes alive. New South Wales and other sites emerge through meticulous art direction, wonderful costumes and delicious cinematography.While the score hangs its hat on a single melody from Robert Schumann's ""Scenes of Childhood,"" the salon performances are captivating and the dance sequences lively and colorful.But this is Judy Davis's film by far. Her performance is funny, fiery and nuanced. She is also a natural beauty who speaks as clearly with her body and eyes as with her words.  She conveys the stubbornness with which many writers pursue their work, forsaking everything for the freedom and space they need to create.The extras here are generous, with the most valuable feature in this two-disk set ""The Miles Franklin Story""-- on which the film is ultimately based.I am grateful this film is accessible again, beauifully remastered in high definition, with a crisp, clear soundtrack.

498937,A3I7EHVQ4AAKFV,B00000F55X,"Christina ""Lisa""","[34, 37]","It only took a decade.  My Brilliant Career is FINALLY on DVD!!!  It is a quiet tour de force of good acting, beautiful art direction and cinematography, a wonderful story about a writer coming out of girlish egotism to join a larger world and form a vision, and an intriguing picture of Victorian Australia among the immigrant society.  Judy Davis is sparkle and tang playing the volatile Sybilla, very molten as she fires, cools and then erupts like any young adult.  Sam Neill, aside from being very effective eyedrops that reminds you of Gary Cooper or Alan Bates, swaggers and holds fast as her suitor, being a willing foil to unpredictability.  There are accomplished supporting performances that paint her story with pathos, a lot of humor with the steady understanding of the importance of family love.  In the spirit of a time when passions were to be restrained and redirected into more interesting pursuits, My Brilliant Career stays in character in this modern visual medium by presenting passion in the guise of mischievous boat rides and a pillow fight for the ages.  You'll feel the panic of dust blowing mercilessly through the windows, parental anxiety, teenage anxiety, affection in the muddiest and wealthier places, and the frustration of love.  It is edifying enough to glimpse into that time as a history or anthropology lesson, or you can just sit back and let it entertain.I first saw this movie on double bill following Night of the Shooting Stars (by the Taviani brothers) at a movie theater in Washington, D.C.  It was like eating really good lasagna with a really good apple pie.  You have to really focus on each film and not think about them together.  A better partner to My Brilliant Career would be Pricilla, Queen of the Desert, Man from Snowy River, or Lantana.  You could also have a Judy Davis film festival by watching it with Husbands and Wives, Impromptu, or that film she did about Judy Garland.  For a Sam Neill film fest, watch the Reilly Ace of Spies series, The Piano, Plenty, or Cry in the Dark.

498938,A28WJUJF6D2ULA,B00000F55X,Dai-keag-ity,"[6, 7]","In early twentieth century Australia a young woman, Sybylla Melvyn, played by the ever-capable Judy Davis, is determined to escape the mundane domestic existence she sees laid out before her, in order to seek her fortune, her ""brilliant career"" as a writer. She passes up a sound offer of marriage to a smitten, wealthy young man, played by none other than Sam Neill, and as a consequence makes due with residing in reduced circumstances as a governess: itself hardly the fulfillment of her egoistical dream. The statement here is more than just one of ideals before romance, it also says much about the reality of the limited choices open to women even as late as the nascence of the 1900's, and the at least short-term fate Sybylla (a stand-in for real life writer Miles Franklin) meets as a result of her choice was nicely depicted by director Gillian Armstrong. The sad fact was that when a woman in times past strayed from those narrow roles society dictated as available to her (wife and mother being by far the most obvious and approved one) she was seldom rewarded. Sure Sybylla is allowed to choose her path for herself and perhaps reaped some feeling of empowerment from that, but My Brilliant Career makes it plainly apparent what the probable outcome is to be. Undoubtedly things could be better for women (and everyone else) than they are today, but dare I point out that we've come a long way...""baby?""",4,Realism Heaped Upon Reality,1172620800,"02 28, 2007",2007,1416,"['early', 'twentieth', 'century', 'Australia', 'young', 'woman', 'Sybylla', 'Melvyn', 'played', 'ever-capable', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'determined', 'escape', 'mundane', 'domestic', 'existence', 'laid', 'out', 'order', 'seek', 'fortune', 'brilliant', 'career', 'writer', 'up', 'sound', 'offer', 'marriage', 'smitten', 'wealthy', 'young', 'man', 'played', 'none', 'other', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'consequence', 'due', 'residing', 'reduced', 'circumstances', 'governess', 'hardly', 'fulfillment', 'egoistical', 'dream', 'statement', 'here', 'more', 'just', 'one', 'ideals', 'romance', 'also', 'much', 'reality', 'limited', 'choices', 'open', 'women', 'even', 'as', 'late', 'nascence', '1900', 'least', 'short-term', 'fate', 'Sybylla', 'stand-in', 'real', 'life', 'writer', 'Miles', 'Franklin', 'result', 'choice', 'was', 'nicely', 'depicted', 'director', 'Gillian', 'Armstrong', 'sad', 'fact', 'was', 'when', 'woman', 'times', 'past', 'strayed', 'narrow', 'roles', 'society', 'dictated', 'available', 'wife', 'mother', 'being', 'far', 'most', 'obvious', 'approved', 'one', 'was', 'seldom', 'rewarded', 'Sure', 'Sybylla', 'allowed', 'choose', 'path', 'herself', 'perhaps', 'reaped', 'feeling', 'empowerment', 'My', 'Brilliant', 'Career', 'plainly', 'apparent', 'what', 'probable', 'outcome', 'be', 'Undoubtedly', 'things', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'women', 'everyone', 'else', 'are', 'today', 'dare', 'point', 'out', ""'ve"", 'come', 'long', 'way', 'baby']",My Brilliant Career VHS
498939,ADS5APY1NKTL4,B00000F55X,"D. Pawl ""Dani""","[10, 11]","This is really a treasure of a film.  It is definitely one of the best depictions of a young woman who breaks away from the norm to follow her own calling life.  The young woman who does this is Sybylla Melvyn (Judy Davis), a headstrong, self-possessed young Australian woman from the Bush, whose parents no longer have money to keep her and send her to live with her grandmother.  Sybylla, who comes from little money, previous charm school training or ""traditional refinement"" in her home is in for a culture shock when she meets her grandmother and aunt, who are both refined and quite traditional in their beliefs about what proper women ought to do.  Proper women should marry, abandon thoughts of independent living, and must remain at the beck and call of their husbands.  This is not the life Sybylla imagines for herself.  She is actually an outspoken, self-directed writer, with more than a glimmer of spunk and mischief in her eyes.  Sybylla also knows she isn't ""conventionally beautiful.""  This doesn't stop two suitors from trying their luck with the spunky young woman.  The first is Frank Hawdon (Robert Grubb), an upper-class, uptight and arrogant man who works for her grandmother and picks her up at the train station.  Sybylla lets him know in no uncertain terms that she doesn't return his affections.  The second suitor is Harry Beecham (Sam Neill), a young man who starts out as ""mates"" with her, participates in a good-natured pillow fight with ""Syb"" and ends up with feelings for her that run deeper than friendship.This is an excellent period piece, set around circa 1900 in Australia, at a time where the opinion of women and their place in society was undergoing serious ruptures and transitions.  Sybylla is a product and example of that rapture, and is truly an inspiration for any young woman who challenges convention.  Judy Davis is masterful in her role and the supporting cast is equally engaging.

Based on the actual life experiences of Miles Franklin, this is an adaptation of her autobiography.  In the story, her character is called Sybylla Melvyn.Sybylla is a rather plain, young woman with few options available to her but to marry.  Her outspoken and lively behavior makes her less than a prime candidate to marry a man of stature in the Victorian Era.  Having grown-up living on a lonely farm with few pleasures and few friends, her parents are rather poor farmers.  When her family makes arrangements for her to marry she refuses.  Due to her being ""past"" her prime (late teens?), she is sent away to live with her wealthy grandmother because her family can't maintain her basic needs (and she needs a stronger disciplinary force to make her presentable to ""society"").  Her desire to become a writer is strongly discouraged to the point that she might have well said she wanted to be a servant or worse.  Women were made to marry and have babies!Though she is considered unattractive, the man she rejected continues his pursuit (more out of outrage at her refusal?), meanwhile, she meets a handsome, successful man, whom all the women in the region lust.  Her playful, carefree nature makes her unique and piquant. They seek the each others' company.  Business takes him to other regions for a long while; then her parent's indenture her for a two year period working as a governess to the family from the backside of Hades educating seven (7) unruly, dirty and undisciplined young children.  As she copes and observes, her future becomes so much clearer to her.  Though these absences and other circumstances create confusion between the two and fear of love lost; eventually, they discover that their feelings remain.  When he proposes, things don't end as expected.The acting was superb and the storyline interesting.  The script was real and the dialogue honest.  There were more than a few chuckles along the way and it was inspirational particularly for the era.How refreshing to have a story sans blood, violence, perversion and lewd sex scenes.

Whileit's feminist ideals are inspiring and handled with complexity, there'sa certain lack of emotion to it. We don't really get the complex, deepbitter-sweetness of choosing loneliness over loss of self.Also, that the film forces that choice at all seems a bit disingenuous.Nothing about Sam Neil's character suggests he would repress ourheroine - indeed he clearly loves her for the free spirit she is. Toreally have her need to make an either/or decision 'work' we'd need togo further into their relationship and her psychology.Last, a number of the supporting roles tend towards clich&eacute;s about boththe upper and lower class.

I only add my comments here, to give prospective buyers a full range of opinions since there are so many raves.I watched this film for about forty-five minutes and like the other ""contrarian"" I really tried to like it.  From the get-go, the message was broadcast loud and clear---that the heroine was not about to settle for the type of life that was being offered to her.  She was different, spunky, full of life and energy and blessed with a full head of thick red hair and freckles to match. And she wants to be an Artist.  (Think ""Jo"" of Little Women, but Aussie stlye---a bit more rustic.)She is initially saved from a life of servitude by the generous offer of her very wealthy grandmother, who rescues her from the outback and brings her to the city her to live in her magnificent home with her family.  They freshen her up, give her beautiful clothes and introduce her to suitors who will give her a life of ease and luxury.  Sybilla turns up her nose at all of that, clinging to her dream of being an Artist. She hasn't decided yet what field of art she will pursue yet...music? writing? perhaps the theater?  This shows the level of realism where she lives.  A real artist would have been actively practicing her art form by the time she is S's age.  She does know one piece on the piano which she plays repeatedly with a dogged enthusiam if not with much talent.What Sybilla is very good at, though, is scorning everyone she feels is her inferior and that includes most everyone.  I could certainly sympathize with her objection to being married off to someone she doesn't love, but she does love one of the men, who is charming and sweet as well as well-off.  Judy Davis, whose performance I loved in Passage to India, was appropriately spunky here but the amount of smug smirking really turned me off. I think it would be possible to show energy and an independent spirit without being so snotty.  We're supposed to be rooting for this character but I found nothing to endear her to me.  After a while I really didn't care what happened to this ungrateful girl and I turned it off.Maybe it got better as S. met the bumps of life and matured.

Someone who didn't want to be pigeon-holed and would bravely pursue her own way on her own terms.  So I recently purchased the blu-ray based upon these fond memories and what do I think now?Well, Sybylla was not as likable.  Her behavior and methods didn't seem as high-minded as I had thought when I was younger.  Sybylla was still a sympathetic character, either to be trapped in the boondocks with little chance to break out of the rut of never-ending farm life, or be expected to make a good marriage.  No other 'acceptable-for-a-woman' choices were available.  Sybylla was a non-conformist, even a radical for the times, which was admirable.  She admits to her egotistical nature from the jump.  However, in my latest viewing her selfishness seemed more pronounced and damaging to even the most well-meaning of her circle.  I felt a wee bit more sympathy for her mother exasperated by a daughter who seemed to prefer to sit and dream of artistic greatness - in what field she didn't know really, although she did demonstrate talent - rather than help about the house. I thought her suitors (even the one who was a confirmed a$$) could be forgiven for believing their efforts were welcome.  One opinion didn't change - her choice in the end was the best one and made for the most authentic ending.  Oh, and the pillow fight was still hot.Sybylla remains interesting, and watching her slow maturation was better appreciated this time around.

I am not sure that I knew what I was getting ready to watch when I read the description and I am a bit torn over the heroine's decisions. Sybylla (Judy Davis) is hoydenish, wild, independent and free spirited in a time where the ideal woman was the complete opposite. And yet she is able to get wealthy, mannered men to fall in love with her. She grew up poor on a small farm in the Australian outback, but she had huge dreams of creating a brilliant career. With a father who spent more time drunk than sober and large family, Sybylla's mother was forced to break the news to her eldest daughter that they could not longer afford to feed her and that she needed to start working. As a servant. Sybylla is horrified and refuses to work as a servant, but has few options open to her. Then her grandmother miraculously offers to have Sybylla stay with her so that she has the opportunity to make a good match and secure a future for herself. Her grandmother is quite wealthy and has the reputation and the means to find Sybylla a good husband, but, of course, Sybylla is having nothing of it. Sybylla takes polish well and it was fun to see her transformation, but I could clearly see forks in the road of her life and I am not sure that she always took the right one.I rarely discuss the endings of movies I watch as I don't don't want to spoil the end of the movie for you if you don't want to know, but I am going to discuss it this time. Fair warning, stop reading now if you don't want to know. Still with me? Okay, here we go. I am in my early 30s and work full time and provide for myself. I have a career, not an illustrious career, not even a particularly well-paying career, but I am independent and provide for myself. I have never had a serious relationship and never had to decide whether to accept a marriage proposal so I am not sure what I would have done. I do feel that this character, Sybylla, made a wrong choice. She turned down 2 marriage proposals -- 1 that was a joke, really -- but 1 was serious and he did believe that he loved Sybylla. And Sybylla led him on. There is just no other way to put it. She asked Harry (Sam Neill) to wait for her for 2 years to give her a chance to live and when he returns for her, she feeds him some lame line about how they would make each other miserable and she has to write and so she has to make it on her own. Okay, so how are you making it on your own when you still live in your parents' home? Can you not be married to a wealthy man and continue your writing? Is this beneath you? I get frustrated with characters like hers, which is based on a true story because she thinks she is getting what she wants, but I don't think she knows. I think she will have regrets and it will be too late to do anything about it. And why do men always fall for women like this? I guess I just don't get it.I enjoyed this film for the historical feel, the beautiful costumes, the old-time manners in police society, the tough farm women who battled against the wilderness everyday and I particularly enjoyed the music and the scenery. The music ranges from beautiful orchestral arrangements to Australian ditties that would have been sung in bars and shanties -- songs women in polite society shouldn't know. And I always find Australian scenery beautiful. It is so varied and visually stunning that it makes the movie worth watching for the vistas alone. The movie is also well acted and thoughtfully presented.If you are a looking for a historical film that branches out from the typical British romances, give this one a try. Brace yourself for a few twists and turns along the way as Sybylla is anything but a typical romance heroine, but it is a refreshing change from more by-the-book formulaic period romance pieces.",3,"A Well-Made Historical Drama, But Not Really a Romance",1274745600,"05 25, 2010",2010,3827,"['Hmmm', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'want', 'say', 'film', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'getting', 'ready', 'watch', 'when', 'read', 'description', 'am', 'bit', 'torn', 'heroine', 'decisions', 'Sybylla', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'hoydenish', 'wild', 'independent', 'free', 'spirited', 'time', 'where', 'ideal', 'woman', 'was', 'complete', 'opposite', 'yet', 'able', 'get', 'wealthy', 'mannered', 'men', 'fall', 'love', 'grew', 'up', 'poor', 'small', 'farm', 'Australian', 'outback', 'had', 'huge', 'dreams', 'creating', 'brilliant', 'career', 'father', 'who', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'drunk', 'sober', 'large', 'family', 'Sybylla', 'mother', 'was', 'forced', 'break', 'news', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'could', 'not', 'longer', 'afford', 'feed', 'needed', 'start', 'working', 'servant', 'Sybylla', 'horrified', 'work', 'servant', 'few', 'options', 'open', 'Then', 'grandmother', 'miraculously', 'have', 'Sybylla', 'stay', 'so', 'opportunity', 'make', 'good', 'match', 'secure', 'future', 'herself', 'grandmother', 'quite', 'wealthy', 'reputation', 'means', 'find', 'Sybylla', 'good', 'husband', 'course', 'Sybylla', 'having', 'nothing', 'Sybylla', 'polish', 'well', 'was', 'fun', 'see', 'transformation', 'could', 'clearly', 'see', 'forks', 'road', 'life', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'always', 'took', 'right', 'one.I', 'rarely', 'endings', 'movies', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'end', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'am', 'going', 'discuss', 'time', 'Fair', 'warning', 'stop', 'reading', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'Still', 'Okay', 'here', 'go', 'am', 'early', '30s', 'work', 'full', 'time', 'provide', 'have', 'career', 'not', 'illustrious', 'career', 'not', 'even', 'particularly', 'well-paying', 'career', 'am', 'independent', 'provide', 'have', 'never', 'had', 'serious', 'relationship', 'never', 'had', 'decide', 'accept', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'do', 'feel', 'character', 'Sybylla', 'made', 'wrong', 'choice', 'turned', 'down', '2', 'marriage', 'proposals', '1', 'was', 'joke', 'really', '1', 'was', 'serious', 'did', 'believe', 'loved', 'Sybylla', 'Sybylla', 'led', 'just', 'other', 'way', 'put', 'asked', 'Harry', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'wait', '2', 'years', 'give', 'chance', 'live', 'when', 'lame', 'line', 'how', 'would', 'make', 'other', 'miserable', 'write', 'so', 'make', 'own', 'Okay', 'how', 'are', 'making', 'own', 'when', 'still', 'live', 'parents', 'home', 'Can', 'not', 'be', 'married', 'wealthy', 'man', 'continue', 'writing', 'beneath', 'get', 'frustrated', 'characters', 'hers', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'getting', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'think', 'will', 'have', 'regrets', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'late', 'do', 'anything', 'why', 'do', 'men', 'always', 'fall', 'women', 'guess', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'it.I', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'historical', 'feel', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'old-time', 'manners', 'police', 'society', 'tough', 'farm', 'women', 'who', 'battled', 'wilderness', 'everyday', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'music', 'scenery', 'music', 'beautiful', 'orchestral', 'arrangements', 'Australian', 'ditties', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'sung', 'bars', 'shanties', 'songs', 'women', 'polite', 'society', 'should', ""n't"", 'know', 'always', 'find', 'Australian', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'so', 'varied', 'visually', 'stunning', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'vistas', 'alone', 'movie', 'also', 'well', 'acted', 'thoughtfully', 'presented.If', 'are', 'looking', 'historical', 'film', 'out', 'typical', 'British', 'romances', 'give', 'one', 'try', 'Brace', 'few', 'twists', 'along', 'way', 'Sybylla', 'anything', 'typical', 'romance', 'heroine', 'refreshing', 'change', 'more', 'by-the-book', 'formulaic', 'period', 'romance', 'pieces']",My Brilliant Career VHS
498950,A18C1PCR8WUAST,B00000F55X,"Tracy Hodson ""Awi Usdi""","[69, 71]","Gillian Armstrong and Judy Davis (as the autobiographer, Sybilla Melvyn in the film, a woman named Miles Franklin in real life) made their stunning entrances into directing and acting stardom in this little gem of a film, stunningly photographed in the Outback of Australia by Donald McAlpine (whose genius would 20 yrs. later, be married to another Australian's genius, Baz Luhrmann, to bring us both ""Romeo + Juliet"" and the extraordinary ""Moulin Rouge""), and who here brought the stark beauty of the Bush to life in glorious tones of gold and rust. This was later contrasted with the unexpectedly green, white-linen-ed, lush environment of Sybilla's grandmother's home, where she meets up with the quickly love-struck Harry Beecham (Sam Neill). Utterly charmed by her wit, energy, freedom of spirit, he is quickly bowled over by how different this untamed woman of the Outback is from his genteel friends, all of whom seem to have moved to Australia in order to transform it into England, and themselves into a sort of less costly version of the ""aristocracy."" He's unprepared for a woman whose early morning greeting consists of a pillow thrown out of a window onto his head, leading to an all-out pillow fight, when most of the young eligible women he knows are too busy learning to sip tea properly to even have the time, let alone the inclination, to chase him into a nearby meadow with a pillow as a weapon. Rolling around in the grass isn't what young ladies do at the turn of the century, even in only relatively civilized Australia, and this rollicking scene sums up both the reasons they get on so well and are so very imcompatible. For Sybilla, her playfulness is that of a free, fun-loving tomboy, while for him, it's more a form of courtship foreplay. He wants to marry her, and spends the whole movie waiting to hear the one word, ""Yes.""But Sybilla is not to be pinned down. She feels a sense of her own destiny, and giving that over to a marriage before she's 20 is not even conceivable for her. She wants to write, and her passion to do so is motivated by the deep compassion and despair she feels for the strong, beautiful, loving and prickly but lovable people of her harsh country, whom she sees as wasting their lives in an endless toil of day-to-day labor that she finds both noble and pointless. Her mother's early fade to old age, in stark contrast to her sister, who, having stayed behind with their mother, is still gorgeous and healthy, much to Sybilla's surprise (the difference between the two is emphasized by some cross-cutting). We see how life as a farmer's wife in the harsh Outback, working round the clock, having (and burying) baby after baby, has stretched her mother to a thin, exhausted shell of her former self. This grieves Sybilla, though she also is filled with admiration for her. It's this duality of experience that is at the heart of the story.Sybilla's grandmother, elegantly played by Aileen Britton, is a gentle woman with a steel backbone, who has, in her own way, survived a challenging life despite the appearance of ease. She and her (other) daughter Helen, set out to transform Sybilla from wildcat to elegant young woman, combing out a mane of hair we would not see again until a few years later when Helena Bonham Carter showed up in ""A Room with a View,"" giving her facials, teaching her to walk and talk like a lady, and trying (mostly in vain) to make this transformation more than skin deep.As much as Sybilla enjoys the experiences of her new life, she doesn't lose any of the strength with which she was born and which was nurtured on the farm, and when she goes back to her family home she is as much at ease pulling a stuck cow out of the mud as she was in her grandmother's drawing room. Harry finds her here, watching in bewildered admiration from a distance in his perfect clothes and coiffed hair, and again their differences are underscored. It is nearly impossible to see them together, as one can't help but feel that to entirely give up this life would diminish her, yet neither do we want her to live alone and unloved. We are as conflicted as she is.After a long time in the idyllic home of her grandmother, and after asking for and receiving Harry's promise that he'll give her two years to figure out what she wants and who she is before marrying him, Sybilla is forced to leave in order to work as a governess to pay off her father's debt. She is at first discouraged and resentful (particularly as the family lives in filth and ignorance, yet represent a greater economic health than her own fathers's), then falls in love with the family and gives them everything she has. There's a wonderful scene where she reads to them a story, printed on the newspaper the family has papered the walls with (to keep out the nighttime cold); she runs from paper to paper in search of the next chapter, the whole family mesmerized by her energetic and theatrical reading of the story. There is a wonderful irony in this section, which I will not give away here, but she is sent home, and it's this which leads to her to her return to her father's farm, where Harry finds her, and asks her to marry him. But Sybilla still can't promise--she has decided to become a writer, and begs for Harry's understanding. It's a heartbreaking scene between a strong woman, capable of great love yet unable to yet give up her independence, and a warm, good man who neither wants to compromise the woman he loves, nor his own love for her.Throughout her adventures, she never loses sight of her goal, and by the end, her pencil-written, painstakingly produced manuscript (several inches high), is mailed off to a London publisher.Franklin's book was published, and though it was out of print for a long time, I was lucky enough to find a 2nd hand one in a used book store. But perhaps the release of the film onto DVD will stimulate a new printing of the book, too. I recommend it as well. Her writing is down-to-earth and compelling, and clearly fulfilled her goal--she brings to life the people of her country vividly and with great respect and admiration. Both Armstrong and Davis seem to understand and respect how deeply the character of Sybilla lives, and work hard to bring her fully to life. So successful are they that poor Harry Beecham seems really too anemic for her--she lives so deeply that Harry's sheltered life has not grown him up to be as strong and complex as she is. This connundrum haunts her throughout the story.""My Brilliant Career"" was the first film I saw when I moved to Berkeley in 1980 to become a filmmaker, and it was certainly an inspiration. To be able to bring such characters to life and, more importantly to the screen, gave me hope that the art of cinema was still alive and well, despite the massive changes brought about in this country by the new ""blockbuster"" phenomenon. It was a small film, seen by lovers of cinema first, then, after word of mouth, by everyone, including the Academy, who nominated it. Of course, it had won many Australian and European awards already.This little film launched three important careers, Judy Davis', Gillian Armstrong's, and Sam Neill's. For these careers, all brilliant, we should be grateful. That it's also a great work of cinematic art is a fabulous bonus, that now everyone will get to appreciate. It was a long wait, but worth it.",5,"Finally, finally, finally, this gorgeous film is on DVD!",1125360000,"08 30, 2005",2005,7366,"['Gillian', 'Armstrong', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'autobiographer',
