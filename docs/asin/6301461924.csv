Humphrey Bogart gets top-billing in ""The Desperate Hours"" as gangster on the lam Glenn Griffin, but this is really Frederic March's film.  March plays businessman Dan Hilliard, who discovers his home has been invaded and his family taken hostage by Griffin's little band of criminals, which includes his kid brother Hal (Dewey Martin) and the brutish Sam Kobish (Robert Middleton).  That morning Hilliard's biggest concerns had been Chuck Wright (Gig Young), the boyfriend of his daughter Cindy (Mary Murphy), the refusal of young son Ralphie (Richard Eyer) to kiss his old man goodbye, and what wife Eleanor (Martha Scott) is going to make for dinner.  Now he has to find a way to keep his family alive in a world where the police are perfectly willing to gun down unarmed criminals so their ability to protect an innocent family is certainly suspect.This is a taunt drama, carried mostly by the desperation of March's character, who fails every time he tries to prove himself the hero.  Bogart's performance is notable because it is a return to the tough guy role that made him a star, only this time showing more restraint than we had seen two decades earlier.  This 1955 film also stands as a testament to how much things have changed in Hollywood, because they would never allow for this clean of an ending to this situation, a point that would be obvious even without the horrible remake of this film with Mickey Rourke and Anthony Hopkins, which gives into the perceived need for sadistic violence.Ultimately what makes this film work is that the climax exceeds our expectations given the set-up.  You have to admire how a man can walk into a house with an unloaded gun and save the day.  The final confrontation between Hilliard and Griffin is powerful because it speaks to not only the fact that you can hurt somebody without killing them, but also that even when confronted with barbarians there is still virtue in being a civilized man.  I still watch the ending of this film every time I stumble across it on television.  In fact, I just did.",5,"""Get out . . . Get out of my house . . .

MINIVER, THE HEIRESS etc.). Photographed in gleaming deep-focus VistaVision by Lee Garmes (SCARFACE, THE PARADINE CASE), the movie wrings incredible tension from the claustrophobic settings and frequent stand-offs between staunch family man March and embittered con Bogart.

253796,A3L3OKIPMLGAUK,6301461924,Ricardo C.,"[1, 2]","In 1936 a then lesser known actor named Humphrey Bogart appeared as a gangster for the first time in the classic film The Petrified Forest which included screen legends Bette Davis and Leslie Howard. The plot was simple, a notorious gangster. Duke Mantee (Bogart), holds people hostage in a service station in the middle of nowhere awaiting his girlfriend. What made The Petrified Forest so great is it's handling of multiple ideas; Patriotism, freedom, art, philosophy, and the pursuit of your dreams no matter what they are. Most films can't handle more one or two ideas without falling apart and Forest managed to handle more than that and succeeds; Truly a timeless film.Fast forward to 1955 and Bogey, now a screen legend, stars in his penultimate film, The Desperate Hours. Basically, a rip-off of The Petrified Forest with some minor differences.  Instead of an assembly of interesting characters being held hostage, or ones with backgrounds contributing to a important themes, we get a standard suburban family. This was a strictly A-to-B plot, gangsters hold the family hostage, they sweat it out with some events occurring and all the bad guys are gunned down at the end. Fredrick March plays the father of the family being held hostage and though he gives a good preformance, you never feel much for him. I will admit there is some suspense and actually enough to sustain the film but it's ultimately formulaic; A shame since more could have been explored with this material. A couple of times Bogart exposes why he hates March so much: He hates the upper class, the ones on the parole board that said he can't live with ""decent folk"". If only the writers took advantage of this friction. Also another good idea that was wasted was Bogart's relationship towards his younger brother who looked up to him. I never read the play or book this film was based on but chances are it could have more psychological depth then the film. The trend in Hollywood by the 1950's was to make gangsters more one-dimensional then they used to be portrayed in the 1930's. Both Eddie G.

Hilliard,Arthur Kennedy as Deputy Sheriff Jesse Bard,Martha Scott as Eleanor Hilliard,Dewey Martin as Hal Griffin and Gig Young as Chuck Wright.Veteran director William Wyler is at the helm of this mid 50s thriller,with the pairing for the first and only time of thesps Bogie and Fredric March.It is the Petrified Forest meets suburbia.While Petrified had enough eccentricity in its characters and plot to keep you glued to your seat,this one doesn't have near the same dynamic at all.Wyler's direction is good and all actors apprise themselves with surprising hutzpah,but I was expecting a little more tension and twists.It's not bad,it's just could have been much better.The story finds Bogie as one half of the Griffin brothers,along with an overgrown child/convict as their tag along.They have just broken jail and are looking for some place to crash until they're able to get out of town and slip through a dragnet the police have thrown up in the area.The police know they're somewhere nearby but they don't,as the film opens,know exactly.We are introduced,next,to the Hilliard family,with March as the head of the household,who has a wife,a teenage daughter and a young son.It's Father Knows Best,typical suburbia of the 50s time.Bogie and his entourage of course pick the Hilliard home as their hide out when everyone but Mrs.Hilliard is out.One by one each member of the household make their way back home throughout the day the day to find their new guests.Bogie of course has to get tough not only with the Hilliards,but his accomplices also,who both balk at their having to stay so long.After a few confrontations and close calls,the family tries as they might to act normally to the outside world,but the longer it goes on the more""cracks"" appear in the veneer.Eventually Bogie gets in contact with his girlfriend,who agrees to come a fair distance to deliver some money.However she is caught by the cops for running a light in a small town and never makes it.No longer able to act normal,with things getting so desperate,Mr.Hilliard finally sends a note to the police.The police cotton on to his problems after a while and show up just as he is returning with the cash Griffin wanted;sent in the mail.The police at first refuse to let Mr Hilliard return home,but an FBI agent on scene over rules everyone and allows him to go back.Hilliard takes a revolver with him,but with no bullets.Griffin has threatened to kill family members if the police show up,and it is a tense moment for Mr.Hilliard as he re enters his home.Hilliard distracts/tricks one accomplice,who wanders outside only to be picked off by the police.Griffin hears the commotion and takes Hilliard's son as hostage.But Griffin has the gun without the bullets and Hilliard tells his son to run.He gets the drop on Griffin and Griffin is forced to go outside,where he too is gunned down.The film fades to black as the family finally reunite...all safe.I found there were a little too many moments where any one of the Hilliards could have blown the whistle during their normal routines.As it turns out in the end,Mr.Hilliard did just that and everything turned out all right anyways.Of course there wouldn't have been a movie would there?Then there is the teacher who comes a calling on her pupil to see if he is alright.Mr.Hilliard comes home with one of the accomplices who,when he sees the teacher,makes a sudden turn and walks back out.Then March pretends the man is someone whom he met at a bar.Then just as the teacher,uncomfortably,starts to leave with a notebook of Hilliard's son,Mr.Hilliard takes it from her.He reads inside the notebook only to discover a note his wife has scrawled to her asking for help.The teacher,now even more confused,leaves.It's a very awkwardly played scene and it didn't ring true.Then there is the continual coming in and out of the teenage Hilliard's boyfriend.He eventually becomes a real pest as far as the plot goes,which we could have done without.One moment I did find quite good,was the one where the trash collector is being taken for a ride out to the boonies.As they come down the final road where he knows certain death awaits,you can see the absolute terror,confusion and desperation in his face.By the way the teacher is none other than Beverley Garland,in an uncredited role.Watch for the man who Griffin's brother gets a ride with when he leaves.It is Joe Flynn,also in an uncredited role.You may better know him as Capt.Binghamton of McHales Navy.The Hilliard son is none other than Richard Eyer,who was quite the good little actor.You will better know him from the 7th Voyage of Sinbad as the Genie of the lamp.And oh yes,Alan Reed,the voice of the future Fred Flintstone,is one of the detectives...see if you can spot him.Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 2:35:1.This print does how some wear,especially in the first reel,but gets better as it goes along.Generally though it is clear and crisp.There are no extras in this B&W; film.All in all this is a film which should have been better than it was.The film relies too heavily on Bogie's menace of the Petrified Forest vein,but the plot holes work against much of the film and weaken it.As I said it is not a bad movie,just one that should have been better,considering the talent on hand. 3 1/2 stars.",4,Petrified Forest comes to suburbia-3 1/2 stars.,1375401600,"08

And that's unfortunate because he looks miscast in this home invasion feature drama.  After all, 56 year olds have usually been promoted to lead crime syndicates (if they're still alive) and leave climbing through kitchen windows to the young Turks.  Paul Newman on the other hand, was 30 when the picture was made and would have been the perfect fit.Bogart reprises the role of Duke Mantee he first conceived back in 1936 in The Petrified Forest; there is even a Bogart crack ""Duke Mantee grown up,""  and one can't help wondering why Bogie would want to hang around that kind of role considering what he achieved afterward.So it's really Frederic March's picture, his performance is taut and tight lipped - be secure in the knowledge you're getting a first rank effort from March, with Bogie of secondary interest leading a band of wastrels that include Robert Middleton giving a suitably greasy performance as a psychopathic marauder.  Martha Scott and Mary Murphy give convincing performances as wife and daughter to the Frederic March character conflicted in how to proceed when Bogart's band of conscripts hold him and his family hostage.

We know who will win but we don't know how. The excellent twists and turns keep us forever surprised. Spencer Tracy originally declined the role opposite Bogart because he refused second billing.All acting is superb, though a bit of overkill with the 2 hysterical women captors. The child actor is a marvelous spunky character who never rose to deserved fame as did other kid actors.As one reviewer wrote, What indeed would we do in this same situation, where Bogart & his 2 prison cronies hold a suburban family hostage. Fredric March, with his ""clickety-clickety"" mind, as Bogey calls it, is constantly trying to outwit the brutal escaped convicts once they escape from their jail like uncaged lions.This is actually a great family action film where true loyal family values dominate, unlke today, and the starring family actually sits down for meals together and lovingly communicate with one another.As a point of interest, the story is loosely based on the eponymous novel.
