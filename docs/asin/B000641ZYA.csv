Two of the DVDs has a lot of songs on them, as well as the history of Crosby, Stlls, Nash and Young, as well. I hope everyone enjoys them as much as we are enjoying them. A MUST buy.

However, if you don't have the other two, buy this! The third historical overview is very good and includes some footage of Moe, Larry & Curly playing with the Ontario Shemp on ""Down By The River"" that indicates they could on occasion produce music as a quartet. IThe historical footage traces the early days of the three of them well and helps bolster the notion that Nash at one point was really a major catalyst to the effort. Always though, Crosby is the one who rivets your attention. From the start, he was the creative genius, the one in the group who cast aside the ropes and flew far too close to the sun. Yet had he not, the power of his music and observations would not ring with the accuracy that they do today.What's really missing is Ol Shakey's JOURNEY THROUGH THE PAST. I have never figured out why he thinks he is exercising meticulous artistic integrity, but then I was born in Ottawa. They get loopier as you go West. JOURNEY would round out the nascent period in the lives of these four, at least up to the mid-70's.As a package, get it if you don't have the other 2. Otherwise wait, Rhino is sure to issue the third sooner or later.",4,Pity Rhino just doesn't offer the third as stand alone,1099526400,"11 4, 2004",2004,1328,"['ACCOUSTIC', 'DAYLIGHT', 'were', 'terrific', 'documents', 'so', 'agree', 'art', 'here', 'bit', 'redundant', 'offer', 'again', 'option', 'purchase', 'third', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'other', 'two', 'buy', 'third', 'historical', 'overview', 'very', 'good', 'footage', 'Moe', 'Larry', 'Curly', 'playing', 'Ontario', 'Shemp', 'Down', 'River', 'could', 'occasion', 'produce', 'music', 'quartet', 'IThe', 'historical', 'footage', 'early', 'days', 'three', 'well', 'bolster', 'notion', 'Nash', 'one', 'point', 'was', 'really', 'major', 'catalyst', 'effort', 'Always', 'Crosby', 'one', 'who', 'attention', 'start', 'was', 'creative', 'genius', 'one', 'group', 'who', 'cast', 'aside', 'ropes', 'flew', 'far', 'too', 'close', 'sun', 'had', 'not', 'power', 'music', 'observations', 'would', 'not', 'ring', 'accuracy', 'do', 'really', 'missing', 'Ol', 'Shakey', 'JOURNEY', 'THE', 'PAST', 'have', 'never', 'figured', 'out', 'why', 'exercising', 'meticulous', 'artistic', 'integrity', 'then', 'was', 'born', 'Ottawa', 'get', 'loopier', 'go', 'West', 'JOURNEY', 'would', 'round', 'nascent', 'period', 'lives', 'four', 'least', 'up', ""mid-70's.As"", 'package', 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'other', '2', 'Otherwise', 'wait', 'Rhino', 'sure', 'issue', 'third', 'sooner', 'later']",N/A
