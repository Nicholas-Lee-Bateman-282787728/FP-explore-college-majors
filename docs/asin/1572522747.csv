186915,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,1572522747,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Some films are so raw and so real that they tend to break your heart more so than others.  `Ponette' is one of those films.The film is pretty simple in scope.  Young Ponette is in a car accident with her mother.  She walks away with a broken arm, but her mother loses her life.  The film basically follows Ponette as she learns to grapple with the fact that she will never see her mother again.  She becomes rather reclusive and aggressive and defensive.  She fights her depression and her grief the only way she knows how.  She isn't yet old enough to learn balance and so she dwells in her pain and sorrow almost constantly.  Her young friends try to help her (sometimes) and the adults in her life try their best to console her, but in the end Ponette has to discover for herself just how to be happy.I want to say this up front.  Some have criticized the depiction of Ponette's father in the film, stating that he is cruel for the way he reacts to Ponette's longing for her mother.  I don't agree with this.  I don't feel he was a cruel man at all.  He was emotionally crushed by the loss of his wife and the realization that he was going to have to raise this little girl all on his own.  He was angry with his wife for leaving him alone.  He missed her, he longed for her, but he knew that he couldn't show that because he had to be strong for Ponette.  It's only natural for the man to feel as though he must hide his feelings in order to take care of those around him.  If he were to grieve, who would console his daughter?  Sure, he snaps at her and calls her crazy, but this is out of frustration and not something he is proud of.I completely understand that overwhelming feeling to `fix' everything.This film, while simple, becomes so much more thanks to a stunning performance given by 4-year-old Victoire Thivisol.  Yes, I said 4-years-old!  In fact, this performance is SO good that I'm tempted to call it the best of the 90's.  Everything feels nature coming from her.  Every tear, every outburst, every solemn stare; you can't help but feel it in your gut.  Having a 3-year-old at home, I can see so much of her in this performance and so it speaks to my heart.It's a performance you have to see to believe, honestly.In the end, this is a film I highly recommend.  It is a French film, so be forewarned that there are subtitles (something that has NEVER bothered me, but I understand that it deters some) but the language spoken by this young girl's face breaks all barriers.  This is a beautifully moving film about the bond formed between mother and daughter and the strength it takes to `learn to be happy'.",5,Learning to be happy...,1269561600,"03 26, 2010",2010,2626,"['films', 'are', 'so', 'raw', 'so', 'real', 'tend', 'break', 'heart', 'more', 'so', 'others', 'Ponette', 'one', 'films.The', 'film', 'pretty', 'simple', 'scope', 'Young', 'Ponette', 'car', 'accident', 'mother', 'away', 'broken', 'arm', 'mother', 'life', 'film', 'basically', 'Ponette', 'grapple', 'fact', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'mother', 'again', 'rather', 'reclusive', 'aggressive', 'defensive', 'depression', 'grief', 'only', 'way', 'how', ""n't"", 'yet', 'old', 'enough', 'learn', 'balance', 'so', 'pain', 'sorrow', 'almost', 'constantly', 'young', 'friends', 'try', 'help', 'sometimes', 'adults', 'life', 'try', 'best', 'console', 'end', 'Ponette', 'discover', 'just', 'how', 'be', 'happy.I', 'want', 'say', 'up', 'front', 'have', 'criticized', 'depiction', 'Ponette', 'father', 'film', 'stating', 'cruel', 'way', 'Ponette', 'longing', 'mother', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'cruel', 'man', 'was', 'emotionally', 'crushed', 'loss', 'wife', 'realization', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'raise', 'little', 'girl', 'own', 'was', 'angry', 'wife', 'leaving', 'alone', 'missed', 'longed', 'knew', 'could', ""n't"", 'show', 'had', 'be', 'strong', 'Ponette', 'only', 'natural', 'man', 'feel', 'must', 'hide', 'feelings', 'order', 'take', 'care', 'were', 'grieve', 'who', 'would', 'console', 'daughter', 'Sure', 'crazy', 'frustration', 'not', 'something', 'proud', 'of.I', 'completely', 'understand', 'overwhelming', 'feeling', 'fix', 'everything.This', 'film', 'simple', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'thanks', 'stunning', 'performance', 'given', '4-year-old', 'Victoire', 'Thivisol', 'Yes', 'said', '4-years-old', 'fact', 'performance', 'SO', 'good', ""'m"", 'tempted', 'call', 'best', '90', 'Everything', 'feels', 'nature', 'coming', 'tear', 'outburst', 'solemn', 'stare', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'gut', 'Having', '3-year-old', 'home', 'can', 'see', 'so', 'much', 'performance', 'heart.It', 'performance', 'have', 'see', 'believe', 'honestly.In', 'end', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'French', 'film', 'so', 'be', 'forewarned', 'are', 'subtitles', 'something', 'NEVER', 'bothered', 'understand', 'language', 'spoken', 'young', 'girl', 'face', 'barriers', 'beautifully', 'moving', 'film', 'bond', 'formed', 'mother', 'daughter', 'strength', 'learn', 'be', 'happy']",Ponette

While her Father is loving and sympathetic towards his daughter, he offers little solace or hope to help her come to grips with her immense loss. After the funeral Ponette is left at boarding school where she attempts to deal with her loneliness with other children her own age who soon begin to offer advise on how Ponette may be able to remain in contact with her dead Mother. Death, dreams, Heaven, Jesus, the All-Mighty are all discussed by this group of bright, young minds who try and help her make sense of it all. Even the use and benefit of magic Smarties is considered as a possible avenue to the realm of the dead. Through all the grief and sorrow Ponette eventually discovers the subtle truth about such adults concerns and finds the courage to move on and accept things for what they are. After all, ""Happy spirits like your Mommy never die.""Critique: `Ponette' is a thoroughly captivating French movie from '97 starring Victoire Thivisol, the most charming little four year old ever to appear on film. It's really quite disarming to witness such emotional angst portrayed so perfectly by a little child and it's all captured so intimately by the camera one almost feels as though you could reach out and comfort her.

While so many films turn kids into junior adults, Ponette is very  much a little girl with a kids gulibility.  And the actress playing Ponette  does not seem like she is acting at all.  She makes it seem as if this  really was happening and the filmmakers had hidden cameras filming her.  It  is a wonderful film, which I can't rave enough about.

186918,APXZRLC8LO165,1572522747,Carly,"[3, 3]","It seems nearly impossible to watch &quot;Ponette&quot; and not be completely spellbound at the conclusion of such an emotional roller coaster ride of a film. No other film that you see in your life will likely come even close to matching the uniqueness, emotion, strength, and amazing depth of this story. Before watching it, however, note that this is not merely a movie depicting natural human suffering; it is the heartbreaking plight of a child, a 4-year-old little girl whose situation may very well be something that few of us can claim to have actually experienced ourselves. Therefore, we are drawing ourselves in to this child's story and are learning an important lesson on human suffering from her. The emotions are formed beautifully and are strikingly accurate throughout the film, but be warned that you are not going to be able to look into this little girl's eyes without feeling your heart breaking and going completely out to her.I doubt that any of us could say anything other than &quot;amazing&quot; when describing the acting job of four-year-old Victoire Thivisol in this movie. For having to play a child who has just lost her mother and is having her emotions almost completely rejected and ignored by the other people in her life, Thivisol turns in a performance that makes you wonder what children know that we don't. After seeing this film a few times, I have started to examine Thivisol's intense crying scenes a little closer. This isn't a child who's just yukking it up for the camera; look into those big, heartbroken eyes and see a little girl who has become her character to the maximum full, both inside and out. While this was basically the only way to help us get the best possible vision of what the child in the title role was feeling inside, it is also disturbing to see that kind of thick emotion from such a young child actress in a movie This is the only reason that I refrained from giving the film a full five stars; Thivisol's acting seemed just a tad too real. Still, I give this amazing little girl big-time credit for taking on such a complex and emotionally demanding role in such a deeply rooted film.&quot;Ponette&quot; is certainly a heartbreaker, but it ends with a strong enough degree of hope to prevent it from being completely depressing and unbearable. Through the pain of watching this child go through such trauma, you are drawn by her courage and inspired by her eventual ability to cope in a way that can ONLY be done and taught by a child.Bottom line? It's emotionally pushing, but at the same time, you will not regret a single tear or grain of emotion that you have given to little Ponette.",4,Do yourself a favor and see this film....,1042243200,"01 11, 2003",2003,2657,"['nearly', 'impossible', 'watch', 'quot', 'Ponette', 'quot', 'not', 'be', 'completely', 'spellbound', 'conclusion', 'such', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'film', 'other', 'film', 'see', 'life', 'will', 'likely', 'come', 'even', 'close', 'matching', 'uniqueness', 'emotion', 'strength', 'amazing', 'depth', 'story', 'watching', 'however', 'note', 'not', 'merely', 'movie', 'depicting', 'natural', 'human', 'suffering', 'heartbreaking', 'plight', 'child', '4-year-old', 'little', 'girl', 'situation', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'something', 'few', 'can', 'claim', 'have', 'actually', 'experienced', 'Therefore', 'are', 'drawing', 'child', 'story', 'are', 'learning', 'important', 'lesson', 'human', 'suffering', 'emotions', 'are', 'formed', 'beautifully', 'are', 'strikingly', 'accurate', 'film', 'be', 'warned', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'look', 'little', 'girl', 'eyes', 'feeling', 'heart', 'breaking', 'going', 'completely', 'her.I', 'doubt', 'could', 'say', 'anything', 'other', 'quot', 'amazing', 'quot', 'when', 'describing', 'acting', 'job', 'four-year-old', 'Victoire', 'Thivisol', 'movie', 'having', 'play', 'child', 'who', 'just', 'lost', 'mother', 'having', 'emotions', 'almost', 'completely', 'rejected', 'ignored', 'other', 'people', 'life', 'Thivisol', 'performance', 'wonder', 'what', 'children', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'seeing', 'film', 'few', 'times', 'have', 'started', 'examine', 'Thivisol', 'intense', 'crying', 'scenes', 'little', 'closer', ""n't"", 'child', 'who', 'just', 'yukking', 'up', 'camera', 'big', 'heartbroken', 'eyes', 'see', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'become', 'character', 'maximum', 'full', 'inside', 'out', 'was', 'basically', 'only', 'way', 'help', 'get', 'best', 'possible', 'vision', 'what', 'child', 'title', 'role', 'was', 'feeling', 'inside', 'also', 'disturbing', 'see', 'kind', 'thick', 'emotion', 'young', 'child', 'actress', 'movie', 'only', 'reason', 'refrained', 'giving', 'film', 'full', 'five', 'stars', 'Thivisol', 'acting', 'seemed', 'just', 'tad', 'too', 'real', 'Still', 'give', 'amazing', 'little', 'girl', 'big-time', 'credit', 'taking', 'complex', 'emotionally', 'demanding', 'role', 'such', 'deeply', 'rooted', 'film.', 'quot', 'Ponette', 'quot', 'certainly', 'heartbreaker', 'strong', 'enough', 'degree', 'hope', 'prevent', 'being', 'completely', 'depressing', 'unbearable', 'pain', 'watching', 'child', 'go', 'such', 'trauma', 'are', 'drawn', 'courage', 'inspired', 'eventual', 'ability', 'cope', 'way', 'can', 'ONLY', 'be', 'done', 'taught', 'child.Bottom', 'line', 'emotionally', 'pushing', 'same', 'time', 'will', 'not', 'regret', 'single', 'tear', 'grain', 'emotion', 'have', 'given', 'little', 'Ponette']",Ponette

186921,A3RJWHFRUA8V9O,1572522747,D. Anderson,"[6, 15]","An avid viewer of foreign films, and a doting, sappy father of young daughters, I was expecting to love this movie, particularly in light of the stellar reviews it has garnered from others. Perhaps my expectations were  too high.Ponette is a well crafted little film that does, as others  point out, succeed in presenting the children it portrays as unaffected and  genuine.  It contains a few moments of genuine sadness and gentle humor.  The young protagonist and her cousins are charming, and present realistic  glimpses of children's views on life and death. They do not seem to be  acting -- and that is no mean feat.But technical prowess and loveable  cherubs do not a compelling movie make. The whole film -- up until the  penultimate scene in the graveyard -- is a series of vignettes that are  little more than observations.  We are allowed to act as unobtrusive  observers as Ponette mourns, her young friends dispense their varying forms  of childhood wisdom, and the children seek the talisman that will set their  world aright and reunite Ponette with her departed mother. Again, some of  these scenes are charming, but there is little in the way of narrative or  dramatic progression. By two thirds of the way through the film, the  dynamic is predictable and (dare I say) even a little boring. My wife (a  loving, tender-hearted mom herself) lost interest in the film well before  the end.And then there is that penultimate scene, where Ponette is  reunited temporarily with her mother. I do not have a problem with that  plot element in the abstract (as some reviewers have), and I appreciate the  final message from that meeting (&quot;She told me to learn to be  happy&quot;). But the portrayal of the mother by Marie Trintignant felt  very out of place -- coarse and even grating -- when compared with the feel  of the rest of the film. It's hard to express propositionally, but that  performance just did not fit.In sum, watching Ponette is a bit like  following around a group of 4-year-olds, listening to them grapple with the  meaning of life, death, and love for a couple hours. It was sporadically  charming, but lacked enough substance to sustain the entire film.  Perhaps  I would (and will) appreciate it more once my own young children have grown  out of their charming innocence, but I was surprised to find myself  disappointed by Ponette, and expecting more from such a lauded film.",3,"OK, but not great.",961459200,"06 20, 2000",2000,2414,"['avid', 'viewer', 'foreign', 'films', 'doting', 'sappy', 'father', 'young', 'daughters', 'was', 'expecting', 'love', 'movie', 'particularly', 'light', 'stellar', 'reviews', 'garnered', 'others', 'Perhaps', 'expectations', 'were', 'too', 'high.Ponette', 'well', 'crafted', 'little', 'film', 'others', 'point', 'out', 'succeed', 'presenting', 'children', 'unaffected', 'genuine', 'few', 'moments', 'genuine', 'sadness', 'gentle', 'humor', 'young', 'protagonist', 'cousins', 'are', 'charming', 'present', 'realistic', 'glimpses', 'children', 'views', 'life', 'death', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'acting', 'mean', 'feat.But', 'technical', 'prowess', 'loveable', 'cherubs', 'do', 'not', 'compelling', 'movie', 'make', 'whole', 'film', 'up', 'penultimate', 'scene', 'graveyard', 'series', 'vignettes', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'observations', 'are', 'allowed', 'act', 'unobtrusive', 'observers', 'Ponette', 'mourns', 'young', 'friends', 'dispense', 'varying', 'forms', 'childhood', 'wisdom', 'children', 'seek', 'talisman', 'will', 'set', 'world', 'aright', 'reunite', 'Ponette', 'departed', 'mother', 'Again', 'scenes', 'are', 'charming', 'little', 'way', 'narrative', 'dramatic', 'progression', 'two', 'thirds', 'way', 'film', 'dynamic', 'predictable', 'dare', 'say', 'even', 'little', 'boring', 'wife', 'loving', 'tender-hearted', 'mom', 'lost', 'interest', 'film', 'well', 'end.And', 'then', 'penultimate', 'scene', 'where', 'Ponette', 'reunited', 'temporarily', 'mother', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'problem', 'plot', 'element', 'abstract', 'reviewers', 'have', 'appreciate', 'final', 'message', 'meeting', 'quot', 'told', 'learn', 'be', 'happy', 'quot', 'portrayal', 'mother', 'Marie', 'Trintignant', 'felt', 'very', 'place', 'coarse', 'even', 'grating', 'when', 'compared', 'feel', 'rest', 'film', 'hard', 'express', 'propositionally', 'performance', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'fit.In', 'sum', 'watching', 'Ponette', 'bit', 'following', 'group', '4-year-olds', 'listening', 'grapple', 'meaning', 'life', 'death', 'love', 'couple', 'hours', 'was', 'sporadically', 'charming', 'lacked', 'enough', 'substance', 'sustain', 'entire', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'would', 'will', 'appreciate', 'more', 'once', 'own', 'young', 'children', 'have', 'grown', 'charming', 'innocence', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'disappointed', 'Ponette', 'expecting', 'more', 'such', 'lauded', 'film']",Ponette

I was impressed by all the actors and actresses in the recent movie release &quot;Chocolat&quot; staring Juliette Binoche, so I looked up their previous film history.  One of the impressive roles played in Chocolat was that of the young daughter, Anouk, played excellently by Victoire Thivisol.Due to her age I figured this was probably her first film.  But when I looked up her history, much to my surprise I see that she had already won Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival for her role as Ponette in this movie!I was impressed with the honesty of emotions between the children in this movie as Ponette slowly comes to terms with her mother's death.  The film follows Ponette through this painful process of loss, disbelief, belief, faith, and childhood perception of life, death, and the afterlife.The film portrayed this process from a child's eyes extremely well and gives the rest of us pause for thought and reflection at times as well.  There are a couple of well done twists in the movie that are very effective (can't say more without giving too much away).Though sad at times, the film ends on an upbeat note with a positive message.[Those who may find the film slightly slow at times will be repaid for their patience during the last third of the movie]Recommended!",4,"Very good film, story, plot twist, &amp; acting",981331200,"02 5, 2001",2001,1328,"['discovered', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'accident', 'was', 'impressed', 'actors', 'actresses', 'recent', 'movie', 'release', 'quot', 'Chocolat', 'quot', 'staring', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'looked', 'up', 'previous', 'film', 'history', 'One', 'impressive', 'roles', 'played', 'Chocolat', 'was', 'young', 'daughter', 'Anouk', 'played', 'excellently', 'Victoire', 'Thivisol.Due', 'age', 'figured', 'was', 'probably', 'first', 'film', 'when', 'looked', 'up', 'history', 'much', 'surprise', 'see', 'had', 'already', 'won', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Venice', 'Film', 'Festival', 'role', 'Ponette', 'movie', 'was', 'impressed', 'honesty', 'emotions', 'children', 'movie', 'Ponette', 'slowly', 'terms', 'mother', 'death', 'film', 'Ponette', 'painful', 'process', 'loss', 'disbelief', 'belief', 'faith', 'childhood', 'perception', 'life', 'death', 'afterlife.The', 'film', 'portrayed', 'process', 'child', 'eyes', 'extremely', 'well', 'rest', 'pause', 'thought', 'reflection', 'times', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'couple', 'well', 'done', 'twists', 'movie', 'are', 'very', 'effective', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'sad', 'times', 'film', 'upbeat', 'note', 'positive', 'message', 'who', 'may', 'find', 'film', 'slightly', 'slow', 'times', 'will', 'be', 'repaid', 'patience', 'last', 'third', 'movie', ']', 'Recommended']",Ponette
186923,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,1572522747,Dennis Littrell,"[4, 4]","Victoire Thivisol is very good, extraordinary really.  The breath and depth of the part she plays would challenge the greatest actresses.  She is also very beautiful.  She has beautiful eyes and thick, luxurious hair.  She was named best actress at the Venice Film Festival in 1996 for her work  in this film.  She was then four-years-old.  Amazing.But this is also a  tour de force for Director Jacques Doillon who, one can see, guided the  children to be actors, while they in turn taught him about their world.  The magic on the screen is the magic in the world of the children and what  they feel.  We see them cope with the existence they have been thrust into.  We watch as they struggle to make sense of it through experience, fantasy  and play.  We see how they learn to distinguish between what adults think  is real and what they themselves discover is real.  Her father is a  rationalist and feels that his daughter's prolonged sadness about her  mother's accidental death is ""crazy.""  He tells her he will not yell at her  if she stops acting crazy.  She wisely tells him she will.  Already she is  learning to placate the world and its madness; already we see that she is  working out what is ""crazy"" and what is not, and right now she is not sure  which is which.  Her father does not believe in a personal god, but the  women taking care of her do, and so do the other children.  She does not  know what to believe but she wants to believe in anything that will bring  her mother back or allow her to talk to her mother.One may wonder how  Doillon was able to get the children to be so good.  It's clear he had to  immerse himself in their world and win their respect.  He had to listen to  them and remember what it was like to be a child.  These children are  creating their world, as all children are, right before our eyes, and  usually we do not see because we are so filled with our own lives and with  our preconceptions.  The children must learn the world and experience it  all for themselves, regardless of what we think.  Doillon shows us that  process through the eyes of the children and especially through the  extraordinary eyes of Victoire Thivisol, who will steal your heart and  soul, I promise.There is something of the spirit of the lives of the  saints in this film of and about a child.  We see this in Ponette's  struggle to believe in a God who took her mother away and would not answer  her.  She is a saint as a little girl, and she is her very own doubting  Thomas.  But she does not give in to despair.  She talks to God and when  God does not answer, her rationalist streak takes hold and she demands to  know why He doesn't answer her.  When she is blamed by a mean little boy  for causing her mother's death, she doubts herself and wants to die.  Pretending is not enough for her.Unlike some others I thought the ending  was good.  I think the problem was the way the latter part of the scene in  the graveyard was filmed with the false color, too hurriedly, and  (especially) the unconvincing performance of Marie Trintignant who played  her mother.The final words of the film, ""She told me to learn to be  happy"" are at once great words of wisdom that we all might heed; but at the  same time these words are her first compromise with a profane world, in a  sense her first lie, her first ""sin.""  It is fitting that they were spoken  to her father with the underlying understanding that men will want you to  be happy and will be dissatisfied with you if you are not.  Her pleasing  little half smile from the car seat for him shows us that she has learned  she will have to put on a face for the world, and she will.  Nonetheless  one feels there will be a part of her that will remain hers alone.This  is a beautiful, touching, and spiritually moving film, an original work of  art.",5,A deeply spiritual film,960422400,"06 8, 2000",2000,3832,"['Victoire', 'Thivisol', 'very', 'good', 'extraordinary', 'really', 'breath', 'depth', 'part', 'would', 'challenge', 'greatest', 'actresses', 'also', 'very', 'beautiful', 'beautiful', 'eyes', 'thick', 'luxurious', 'hair', 'was', 'named', 'best', 'actress', 'Venice', 'Film', 'Festival', '1996', 'work', 'film', 'was', 'then', 'four-years-old', 'Amazing.But', 'also', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'Director', 'Jacques', 'Doillon', 'who', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'guided', 'children', 'be', 'actors', 'turn', 'taught', 'world', 'magic', 'screen', 'magic', 'world', 'children', 'what', 'feel', 'see', 'cope', 'existence', 'have', 'been', 'thrust', 'watch', 'struggle', 'make', 'sense', 'experience', 'fantasy', 'play', 'see', 'how', 'learn', 'distinguish', 'what', 'adults', 'think', 'real', 'what', 'discover', 'real', 'father', 'rationalist', 'feels', 'daughter', 'prolonged', 'sadness', 'mother', 'accidental', 'death', 'crazy', 'will', 'not', 'yell', 'acting', 'crazy', 'wisely', 'will', 'Already', 'learning', 'placate', 'world', 'madness', 'already', 'see', 'working', 'out', 'what', 'crazy', 'what', 'not', 'right', 'now', 'not', 'sure', 'father', 'not', 'believe', 'personal', 'god', 'women', 'taking', 'care', 'do', 'so', 'do', 'other', 'children', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'believe', 'believe', 'anything', 'will', 'bring', 'mother', 'back', 'allow', 'talk', 'mother.One', 'may', 'wonder', 'how', 'Doillon', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'children', 'be', 'so', 'good', 'clear', 'had', 'immerse', 'world', 'win', 'respect', 'had', 'listen', 'remember', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'child', 'children', 'are', 'creating', 'world', 'children', 'are', 'right', 'eyes', 'usually', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'are', 'so', 'filled', 'own', 'lives', 'preconceptions', 'children', 'must', 'learn', 'world', 'experience', 'regardless', 'what', 'think', 'Doillon', 'process', 'eyes', 'children', 'especially', 'extraordinary', 'eyes', 'Victoire', 'Thivisol', 'who', 'will', 'steal', 'heart', 'soul', 'promise.There', 'something', 'spirit', 'lives', 'saints', 'film', 'child', 'see', 'Ponette', 'struggle', 'believe', 'God', 'who', 'took', 'mother', 'away', 'would', 'not', 'answer', 'saint', 'little', 'girl', 'very', 'own', 'doubting', 'Thomas', 'not', 'give', 'despair', 'God', 'when', 'God', 'not', 'answer', 'rationalist', 'streak', 'hold', 'know', 'why', ""n't"", 'answer', 'When', 'blamed', 'mean', 'little', 'boy', 'causing', 'mother', 'death', 'die', 'Pretending', 'not', 'enough', 'her.Unlike', 'others', 'thought', 'ending', 'was', 'good', 'think', 'problem', 'was', 'way', 'latter', 'part', 'scene', 'graveyard', 'was', 'filmed', 'false', 'color', 'too', 'hurriedly', 'especially', 'unconvincing', 'performance', 'Marie', 'Trintignant', 'who', 'played', 'mother.The', 'final', 'words', 'film', 'told', 'learn', 'be', 'happy', 'are', 'once', 'great', 'words', 'wisdom', 'might', 'heed', 'same', 'time', 'words', 'are', 'first', 'compromise', 'profane', 'world', 'sense', 'first', 'lie', 'first', 'sin', 'fitting', 'were', 'spoken', 'father', 'underlying', 'understanding', 'men', 'will', 'want', 'be', 'happy', 'will', 'be', 'dissatisfied', 'are', 'not', 'pleasing', 'little', 'half', 'smile', 'car', 'seat', 'learned', 'will', 'have', 'put', 'face', 'world', 'will', 'Nonetheless', 'one', 'feels', 'will', 'be', 'part', 'will', 'remain', 'hers', 'alone.This', 'beautiful', 'touching', 'spiritually', 'moving', 'film', 'original', 'work', 'art']",Ponette
186924,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,1572522747,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[4, 5]","Victoire Thivisol is perhaps the youngest child ever to play the leading role in a film.  Sure, there are lots of films showing cute little babies  and children, but usually they have a walk on part. They are not the main  character. And, there are a number of wonderful child actors. But there has  never been a child who could act as well as this child.I was mesmerized  by this film. First, Ponette looks so much like my granddaugher who was  four at the time, I could not take my eyes off her face. Second, because my  granddaughter was four, I had a good basis of comparison for four-year old  behavior. Third, I am sad to say that my granddaughter's father had died  recently and I had a basis for observing a child's reaction to the loss of  a parent.I don't know why Victoire Thivisol didn't win every  conceivable award at the time &quot;Ponette&quot; was released. She is so  real, she is so loveable. You want to take her in your arms and hold her.  The interaction between Ponette and her father, Ponette and her Aunt,  Ponette and her cousins and school friends is truth itself.  At some  points, such as when the father stops the car on the road and lifts Ponette  onto the hood to talk to her face to face about her mother, I thought I was  watching reality.Ponette has to be one of the best films about children  using child actors ever made.

186925,A3EHIGO4FNILXP,1572522747,.fgd,"[2, 5]","After reading it took 2years to make I am uncomfortable with what amounts to child abuse from ambitious parents. The poor mite had to stay in character / keep returning to depressing ponnette for TWO years in order for us adults to be able to sit through the movie. Why? Because 5yr olds cannot act. Even 7 or 8yr oles are problematic. They can however play themselves and themes to do with childhood. See ""Lord of the Flies ""where the children fully understood the dynamics of bullying or they could choose a boy with an innate fascination for biology besides his film character. But 5yr old? Children are too ego-centric to get into another skin. No wonder she looks somber for real. This is the girl who grew up with a phobia for ponies? Did she smile when the directer said 'cut! ?Reaction to grief that age they cry and bury but it is surprising how elastic their minds are. With empathy from adults .Young kids live in the moment after all and death is not mental abuse. Show them a dead animal or story of a dead pet they can and do catch on. Why a film that dwells on possible immediate aftermath if father lacked empathy?But the dragged out maudelin process of this film is all about adults projecting their trips into small children. This is part of a new culture of child-rearing from mid 20th century where kids are babied and cossetted more and longer than they need be. Better for the kid? Not really but strangely cossetting for the parent. And so this infliction of grief on a ponette is absurdly self indulgent. At a pinch is it all about an adult softly chewing over the preciousness of their feelings than watching something in kid-land. Something the French at their worse may be more susceptible to do.Even the sound of spoken French lends itself to this indulgence. And somewhere in the extras of ""lord of the flies"" its noted the film never caught on in France because lack of cosseting and yet the children adapt without adults not sit on the beach bawling their eyes out till a rescue ship arrives.Ponette is both a baby and an adult. Too much of both qualities. Ditto oversentimental adults taking themselves far too seriously. Was it Oscar Wilde who said what kills art is over-earnestness?For example ,near start of film, seeing the same age little boy kiss and hug ponnette like a sexless teen Romeo or full fledged adult was the first sure bad omen and no I did not watch till the end.

After trying to order it twice and asking many times in the video store, I finally got it as a rental.How refreshing it is to see how far a child's perspective and emotions can carry a film.After seeing so many enormous reviews for this movie, I had huge expectations. I was not disappointed. It has an amazing way of taking a simple enough storyline, adding a whole lot of emotion and various characters with their own beliefs, and creating an incredible film that speaks directly where it needs to speak.&quot;Ponette&quot; has the immensely talented Victoire Thivisol carrying on the title role in the story of a four-year-old little girl. Traumatized after living through a car crash that killed her mother, Ponette is sadly forced to undergo more human pain and suffering than any child her age--or any grown human being, for that matter--normally should go through. Her emotions are thoroughly misunderstood by her estranged father and the other people in her life. While she is worlds apart from her cousins, her peers, and her entire family, she immediately clings to the idea that she can communicate with her mother and see her again. But with everyone around her giving her different viewpoints and various outlooks on God, it is often much more than this little girl can handle herself. Only through a very strong and important vision can Ponette finally discover a sense of peace and understanding and, most importantly, be able to go on living her young life.Victoire Thivisol.......WOW! what is there to say about this tremendous little actress that has not already been said? She is absolutely incredible. This is not just a young actress--this is a four-year-old child kicking off her acting career with an extremely complex, emotional, and STARRING role. To get a child this young to do the kind of things that the script called the character to do is just unbelievable. After pulling off this kind of challenging role with such a natural and passionate ability, I'd have a hard time believing that there's any type of acting that Thivisol can't handle. As stated in the film, she is a true &quot;child of God&quot; with tremendous potential in the acting business. I can't imagine anyone who wouldn't want to work with her after seeing her performance in such a hardcore, moving role.With this being said, I have to warn you that you need to watch this film with an open heart, and not a mind with such high expectations. After hearing such good reviews, I expected this film to be the absolute most incredible piece of moviemaking in the world. Literally. You need to let go of all that and just absorb yourself in little Ponette's world. Watch it another time if you need to; only through a wide-open heart can you truly get as much out of this movie as possible.The only part about the film that made me a little skeptical was the way Ponette's mother was presented. &quot;You are nutty but nice. Stop crying; stop complaining. I can't stand a crying child.&quot; Somehow, through these words, she is almost telling her little daughter that her emotions and her ways of expressing them are unnatural and unacceptable. What kind of parent would say this to their four-year-old child who is under such emotional distress and does not understand why she can't be with her mother? It seems like Ponette's superiors are all oblivious to her pain and do not know how to help her, let alone simply allow her to grieve. I mean, come on--she's not feeling sorry for herself; she's in PAIN--deeper pain than some people never know in their whole lives.Nonetheless, this is Ponette's story, and nobody else's. It allows her to share what SHE is going through and tell the story of how she, as a four-year-old child, is coping. It is an emotional headfirst plunge into her distraught life and her personal attempt to put her mother right in the center of a religion that will allow eternal interaction between her and the beloved parent she has lost. Maybe you'll cry, maybe you'll go and hug your mom, maybe you'll use what you learned to make your life better and more liveable. No matter how you react to this movie, however, you will most likely be genuinely touched and forever changed by Ponette's lesson.

186933,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,1572522747,Jeffrey Leach,"[14, 14]","I have agonized and agonized again over how to start a review of the French film ""Ponette."" Perhaps my difficulty stems from attempting to describe a film that falls outside my usual cinematic experiences. After all, a steady diet of slasher movies, out and out gorefests, and films dealing with the supernatural tend to erect certain barriers that can be daunting to circumnavigate. One should simply not look at ""Ponette"" in the same way one views ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Dead Alive,"" and any attempt to do so does a grave disservice to this magnificent experience. And it is an experience, a film unlike any I have ever seen in my long career of cinema watching. I can't even remember now how I came to see this movie, whether I saw a review somewhere and thought it worth watching or whether a friend recommended the movie to me with the hope that I would abandon the world of cheap and cheesy horror flicks. Well, I haven't given up watching bad movies; I don't think anything could make me give up my nasty little hobby, not even a film as sublime as ""Ponette."" But this movie certainly gave me a different perspective, that's for sure.When we first meet the adorable four year old Ponette (Victoire Thivisol), we quickly learn she has gone through a rough patch. She's in a car with her father, arm in a sling, heading out to her aunt's house for an indefinite stay. The conversation between Ponette her dad (Xavier Beauvois) is terse and upsetting: the girl's mother (Marie Trintignant) had an automobile accident with her daughter in the car. While Ponette escaped serious injury--aside from the broken arm--the prognosis for mom doesn't look so good. The accident is far more serious than we initially thought, so serious in fact that our young heroine soon learns her mother has died from her injuries. But what does death mean to a four year old girl? How does a child with absolutely no experience of the wider world cope with the loss of a parent? These are the questions director Jacques Doillon tries to answer in this film. Ponette cannot rely on her grief stricken father, whose devastation is so total that he leaves his daughter with relatives and flees. Her aunt and the adults at school cannot do much to help, either. Instead, Ponette must rely on the assistance of her two cousins, Matiaz (Matiaz Bureau Caton) and Delphine (Delphine Schiltz), and several kids at school to help her through her grief.What is amazing about ""Ponette"" is the performance of little Victoire Thivisol as the distraught child. This is not a case of an older, cynical child playing a younger youth. Thivisol really is roughly four years old in the movie. A question for the ages is how Jacques Doillon managed to get this sort of performance out of a kid. How do you explain a complex sensation like the loss of a parent to a child who has never experienced such pain? Moreover, how do you do this and then get them to mirror it back for the camera? Beats me, but Thivisol somehow manages to convince the viewer that she's going through one of life's worst experiences. I think you'd have to go back to Tatum O'Neal to find an actress with similar abilities. Most child actors simply can't emote the way Thivisol does in this film. We're too familiar with kids in pictures who laugh, act up, or mug for the camera. There is no mugging here unless you count the shenanigans we see from some of the other kids in the film. The emotions seem real, natural and deeply disturbing as only reality can make them. The only way Thivisol's performance won't affect you is if you absolutely despise children.After marveling at the profound range shown by Thivisol, I couldn't help but notice how the movie deals with loss and how human beings cope with such an emotion. The movie shows us scene after scene of Ponette seeking some truth that will explain what happened to her beloved mother and how she can bring her back to life. She goes to a young Jewish girl in her class, Ada (Leopoldine Serre), for help because someone told her Jews are closer to God. Aside from teaching Ponette how to talk to God--which involves serious tests on the playground that will likely make you smile--Ada's information doesn't really help. Information gleaned from adults about Christianity and its notions of the afterlife also provides Ponette with little in the way of concrete answers. Our heroine tries everything she knows, what she thinks of on her own and what others tell her, but nothing brings her mother back. Sadly, the movie sort of cops out at the end, but the journey to the conclusion is far more compelling. What the viewer quickly learns is that the questions asked by Ponette are questions adults ask in the same circumstances. We also question God's motivations and wish beyond hope that anything we do will bring our loved one back to life. There is almost no difference between what Ponette does and what adults do in similar situations.A final element of the film that really moved me concerned the claustrophobic atmosphere of the set pieces. Director Doillon really gives us a sense that we're in a young girl's world through the use of close-ups, lots of interior shots, and the general inaccessibility to adults. Think back to your own childhood, when your world seemed so large but was really constricted to your home and neighborhood. That's the sense we get from ""Ponette,"" that she inhabits a very small world made up of only a few other people and a few surroundings. Anyway, enough of that. You've got to watch ""Ponette"" if you get the chance. You'll never see anything quite like it, I assure you.",5,Magical,1119916800,"06 28, 2005",2005,5606,"['have', 'agonized', 'agonized', 'again', 'how', 'start', 'review', 'French', 'film', 'Ponette',

186935,A1WTYALNQNQG99,1572522747,Larry L. Looney,"[11, 11]","One of the guys who works at a local video store that I frequent, when I asked about this film, said `It's probably the saddest film ever made.'  Whoa.  That's a pretty strong statement, and it further tweaked my curiosity.  When I finally got around to watching it, I could see where he was coming from - but there's a lot more to this fine piece of filmmaking than that.  This is definitely one of the most moving films I've ever seen - and the performance by 4 year-old actress Victoire Thivisol (who portrayed Anouk in CHOCOLAT so well, `later in her career') is absolutely stunning.  I saw the blurb on the cover touting her `best actress' award at the Vienna Film Festival for her work in PONETTE - it's easy to see why.Written and directed by Jacques Doillon, PONETTE tells the story of a very young girl coming to terms with grief and death - hard enough for anyone, but her first experience centers on the death of her mother in a car accident.  Ponette was in the car as well - she wears a cast on her left arm for the entire film - so she has that trauma to deal with also.  Her father isn't around much - he leaves her in the care of her aunt Claire - and when he's with Ponette, he seems to have difficulty exercising empathy and understanding with her, which could easily be due to his own grief over the death of his wife.With the help of her cousins, her aunt, a few understanding schoolmates, a very sensitive and kind teacher, and the strength of her own spirit, Ponette makes the journey to healing.  Getting conflicting advice on death and religion from several quarters, she searches for the path that resonates with truth within her.  The performance Victoire Thivisol turns in here will astound you - I can't recall ever seeing a child this young in a role so demanding do such a fine job.The ending - to which some reviewers have taken exception - worked into the film nicely, I thought.  Much of an individual's objection to it (and I won't spoil it) has to do with his or her own beliefs and feelings - but I thought it fit the story here very well.A minor note -- the information on this product page is a little confusing.  It says 'color/widescreen/Dolby', and then in the 'further details' page says 'full-screen' under 'features'.  The film is in full-screen format on the DVD -- but this certainly doesn't detract from the enjoyment of it.All in all - I can recommend this film VERY highly, but as another reviewer wisely advised, have a box of tissues handy.",5,STUNNING AND CAPTIVATING,1062979200,"09 8, 2003",2003,2491,"['One', 'guys', 'who', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'frequent', 'when', 'asked', 'film', 'said', 'probably', 'saddest', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'Whoa', 'pretty', 'strong', 'statement', 'further', 'tweaked', 'curiosity', 'When', 'finally', 'got', 'watching', 'could', 'see', 'where', 'was', 'coming', 'lot', 'more', 'fine', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'definitely', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'performance', '4', 'year-old', 'actress', 'Victoire', 'Thivisol', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Anouk', 'CHOCOLAT', 'so', 'well', 'later', 'career', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'saw', 'blurb', 'cover', 'touting', 'best', 'actress', 'award', 'Vienna', 'Film', 'Festival', 'work', 'PONETTE', 'easy', 'see', 'why.Written', 'directed', 'Jacques', 'Doillon', 'PONETTE', 'story', 'very', 'young', 'girl', 'coming', 'terms', 'grief', 'death', 'hard', 'enough', 'anyone', 'first', 'experience', 'centers', 'death', 'mother', 'car', 'accident', 'Ponette', 'was', 'car', 'as', 'well', 'cast', 'left', 'arm', 'entire', 'film', 'so', 'trauma', 'deal', 'also', 'father', ""n't"", 'around', 'much', 'care', 'aunt', 'Claire', 'when', 'Ponette', 'have', 'difficulty', 'exercising', 'empathy', 'understanding', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'due', 'own', 'grief', 'death', 'wife.With', 'help', 'cousins', 'aunt', 'few', 'understanding', 'schoolmates', 'very', 'sensitive', 'kind', 'teacher', 'strength', 'own', 'spirit', 'Ponette', 'journey', 'healing', 'Getting', 'conflicting', 'advice', 'death', 'religion', 'several', 'quarters', 'path', 'truth', 'performance', 'Victoire', 'Thivisol', 'here', 'will', 'astound', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'ever', 'seeing', 'child', 'young', 'role', 'so', 'demanding', 'do', 'fine', 'job.The', 'ending', 'reviewers', 'have', 'taken', 'exception', 'worked', 'film', 'nicely', 'thought', 'Much', 'individual', 'objection', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'do', 'own', 'beliefs', 'feelings', 'thought', 'fit', 'story', 'here', 'very', 'well.A', 'minor', 'note', 'information', 'product', 'page', 'little', 'confusing', 'then', ""'further"", 'details', 'page', ""'full-screen"", ""'features"", 'film', 'full-screen', 'format', 'DVD', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'detract', 'enjoyment', 'it.All', 'can', 'recommend', 'film', 'VERY', 'highly', 'reviewer', 'wisely', 'advised', 'have', 'box', 'tissues', 'handy']",Ponette

Moore,"[9, 9]","Four-year-old Victoire Thivisol--who looks as if she could have been the model for Renoir's ""Girl With a Watering Can""--gave such a moving, luminous, unaffected performance in the 1996 film ""Ponette"" that some critics accused writer-drector Jacques Doillon of child abuse. Certainly it's agonizing to watch Thivisol's tearful spasms of grief as the eponymous Ponette, a French nursery-school girl whose mother is killed in a car accident. But Thivisol's performance goes beyond realistic crying; the quiet expression on her face as she visits a chapel, trying to make direct contact with Jesus, would do credit to any adult actress. It's difficult to think of any child actor--with the possible exception of Jackie Coogan in ""The Kid,"" a full three-quarters of a century before--giving such a masterful performance at such an extremely tender age. Even Mary Badham in ""To Kill a Mockingbird""--as good as she was, and as young as she was--didn't quite achieve the miraculous excellence that Thivisol does. (Haley Joel Osment in ""The Sixth Sense"" and Tina Majorino in ""When a Man Loves a Woman"" were as brilliant as Thivisol, but they were also considerably older.) In his screenplay, Doillon demonstrates almost preternatural insight into ""Kidworld""--how children interact with each other, and how they try, with limited experience of the world and contradictory advice from adults, to make sense of life's mysteries and tragedies. And while Ponette's father (Xavier Beauvois) comes across as a jerk, unfortunately it's easy to believe that he--angry, grieving, no longer believing that life has any point--would behave so rudely to his tiny daughter. The film's ending, depending on your viewpoint, is either mawkishly unrealistic or heartrending and deeply satisfying (I take the latter view).

When death or divorce shakes up the world of a child it can be so confusing for a child-like mind to make sense of what has happened.  It's almost like our minds are made up of a long row of coat hooks.  Each hook represents an experience you've had and what you've learned from it.Let's say you go the beach at noon in the summer without sunscreen.  You play in the sun for 2 hours. You're not surprised when you get sunburned.  When you start feeling your skin getting hot and painful you don't cry and wonder, ""what is happening to me?""  You already have a mental coat hook to hang that information on because it's probably happened to you before or to someone you know.When a child loses a parent, if nothing like that has ever happened before, there is no coat hook to hang the information on.  The information seems to float around until a new coat hook gets created in your mind.  Maybe that child finally meets another child who lost a parent.  New coat hook:  I am not alone.  Or maybe that child hears an adult say something nice about the parent they lost. New coat hook:  My parent was nice.  Eventually as time passes the growing child may have experiences where, during a grief-stricken prayer, they feel that the Lord understands their pain and comforts them.  New coat hook:  It helps to pray.  God can comfort me when I am hurt.I just watched this sweet movie, called Ponette, about a little girl who lost her mother.  It was comforting for me to watch this little girl's struggle to make sense of losing a parent.  I was her age when my father died, so her emotions, the off-handed comments and advice from her young peers (and the few adults in the film) was so familiar!  It made me realize how capable and determined children can be in making sense of their world, and how natural it can be for them to be drawn to God.Other family members who watched it with me had never lost a parent, so the film seemed sad to them.  It didn't seem sad at all to me.  It was so comforting, refreshing and healing to watch; even funny at times.

Other films of this type, and IMHO superior to this effort, are Jeux Interdit (Forbidden Games), Truffaut's L'Argent du Poche (Small Change), and of course, the same director's 400 Blows (interesting that these four are all French).  This is such a film. I can't call it a masterpiece, but it is certainly worth seeing, particularly by anyone who has a child.I don't know how they got the performance they did from Victoire Thivisol, who apparently has the ability to release the waterworks at any moment. She was astonishing. Children have qualities such as forgiveness and resiliency that too many adults have either lost or have forgotten about. This tiny actress exhibits these qualities and many more, in spades.I would recommend this film for families. Criticisms I would put forth are that there are far too many closeups--a tendency in today's cinema. Closeups once suggested powerful emotion, and were used sparingly; when they did appear, they had maximum impact. Now films are full of them, and to me, they are the sign of laziness on the part of the director.
