866993,A2RW9MR92QC63N,B0006GAO18,A Fan,"[0, 0]","I'm as much responsible for the untimely demise of this show as the next guy, but it was so under-promoted and jockeyed between time slots as to make viewing nearly impossible.  I am thankful that it has been resurrected in DVD form or we would all have been denied a wonderful (sorry) opportunity.  This show just oozes creativity, from its wacky (but not contrived) characters to its clever wordplay to the terrific camera work.  It's the anti-sitcom.  I have to confess that I was completely charmed by Caroline Dhavernas.  She is spot-on perfect.  At some point in the commentary she said she felt that Todd Holland's direction was half her performance.  It's a great character made mre so by little smirks and micro-expressions.  Speaking of which, Diana Scarwid does a hilarious turn as her overachieving mom and has a patrician manner and unflappable (I think she's actually portraying a frozen Botox expression) exterior.  In one particularly hilarious moment she's trapped with someone she recognizes to be insane and dangerous and she looks away for a moment with an expression of half-horror/half-frozen expression that's just side-splittingly funny.  The whole cast is really well-cast and the family's relationship seems painfully real. I could go on for several pages, but in the end, living well is the best revenge and hopefully enough people will buy and enjoy this set to make Fox regret its haste in dismissing this series.",5,Wonderfalls died for our sins.,1107820800,"02 8, 2005",2005,1442,"[""'m"", 'as', 'much', 'responsible', 'untimely', 'demise', 'show', 'next', 'guy', 'was', 'so', 'under-promoted', 'jockeyed', 'time', 'slots', 'make', 'viewing', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'am', 'thankful', 'been', 'resurrected', 'DVD', 'form', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'denied', 'wonderful', 'sorry', 'opportunity', 'show', 'just', 'oozes', 'creativity', 'wacky', 'not', 'contrived', 'characters', 'clever', 'wordplay', 'terrific', 'camera', 'work', 'anti-sitcom', 'have', 'confess', 'was', 'completely', 'charmed', 'Caroline', 'Dhavernas', 'spot-on', 'perfect', 'point', 'commentary', 'said', 'felt', 'Todd', 'Holland', 'direction', 'was', 'half', 'performance', 'great', 'character', 'made', 'mre', 'so', 'little', 'smirks', 'micro-expressions', 'Speaking', 'Diana', 'Scarwid', 'hilarious', 'turn', 'overachieving', 'mom', 'patrician', 'manner', 'unflappable', 'think', 'actually', 'portraying', 'frozen', 'Botox', 'expression', 'exterior', 'one', 'particularly', 'hilarious', 'moment', 'trapped', 'someone', 'be', 'insane', 'dangerous', 'away', 'moment', 'expression', 'half-horror/half-frozen', 'expression', 'just', 'side-splittingly', 'funny', 'whole', 'cast', 'really', 'well-cast', 'family', 'relationship', 'painfully', 'real', 'could', 'go', 'several', 'pages', 'end', 'living', 'well', 'best', 'revenge', 'hopefully', 'enough', 'people', 'will', 'buy', 'enjoy', 'set', 'make', 'Fox', 'regret', 'haste', 'dismissing', 'series']",N/A

866995,A23L2BR07AOBG1,B0006GAO18,alex bushman,"[9, 10]","One thing I have to note about the posting of this series on Amazon is that as of this date that I am typing this review there are 131 reviews of this product and all of them are positive.  That's quite an accomplishment.  Most shows like this don't get that many favorable reviews, let alone all of them when the review count goes over 50.  Good job, off then to why it has gotten those reviews.  This film has the same premise as another show that has come out on CBS, Joan of Arcadia.  An infinite power or being speaks to the main character, but instead of it being other human beings, it's inanimate animal objects.  They don't have conversations, the objects just tell her to do things.  Since there is no explanation of what she is told, sometimes it takes her awhile to figure out what she's exactly supposed to do.  What's interesting is that if during the show you imagine that this premise is too new age-y, or spiritual, or vague, the series addresses this topic in a few of its episodes and because it meets these criticisms head on, it headlights the fact that it's just a fictional show, lighten up.  One remarkable thing to me is the accomplishment of having a good core of characters in the show that aren't really that crucial in the episodes, but they remain completely real and feel necessary, whereas in a lesser show, they would feel like intrusions.  Even the guest characters were extremely well portrayed and that credit goes to everyone involved.  Interestingly, this series walks a fine line the entire list of episodes and that's between familiarity and strangeness.  Quite frequently, you might notice that a particular element of this show feels like another show that you had seen before,  some elements of this show are inevitable things that must be there, like the relationship between the lead and would be man in her life, Eric.  What allows this show to go over and beyond those other shows is the honest portrayals, and the ability to spring the revelations from the animals in an unexpected way, in unexpected times.  This shows catches you off guard and you don't mind (at least I didn't).  The show leaves you feeling like you're in good hands as an audience member.  Some people are very picky about what kind of entertainment they like to watch on TV.  They don't like just about everything because most TV is just too safe and familiar, whereas other shows are too strange, then there's the litany of reality shows.  What this show does well is that it doesn't settle in any one of those areas.  There are times that it feels safe and familiar in any given episode,  there are times it feels weird, and there are times where it feels truly inspired as well.  The best thing about this series is that it mixes up those elements so that the show never becomes monotonus.  Before I finish this review it would criminal of me not to mention the episode ""Lovesick Ass"" which is on the second disc of the DVD set.  It features the child actor Spencer Breslin in one of the funniest roles ever written for TV, in my opinion. The ending to that episode is just so twisted, but you don't feel that way when seeing it because of what happens before.  Also, in summation and to add a little bit before I go back to watching this show, this show strikes me as a satire of the prototypical, healthy American family, and it's smug in its depictions of the characters' in the show, but it was OK with me because although I could see how it was working, it wasn't as extreme as Happy Tree Friends and I could always relate to what was going on in the series.  By the way, I hope this isn't the last we in the States see of Caroline Dhaveras who is the star and a French Canadian actress/TV star in her own right.

The run of episodes completes a one-season story arc on a pitch perfect note that will leave all viewers satisfied.The acting in this show is almost uniformly wonderful, though made up largely of ""no name"" actors, from the unknown star Caroline Dhavernas down to some of the smaller parts such as the brother played by Lee Pace (who is excellent in a part far different from his amazing role in the film Soldier's Girl). The season arc about Jaye's flirtation with a jilted bartender is cute, but actually the least interesting thing about the show (due in a large part to the one poor casting choice, the rather boring Tyron Leitso). But the rest of the show is smart and funny and Jaye's character growth through both that relationship and especially her interactions with her parents, brother and sister manage to strike the perfect balance of sarcastic and funny, witty and weird.If you only caught the show on tv, pick it up for the wealth of unaired episodes and if you never saw it at all don't miss out on the opportunity to watch the series through.",4,hilarious show ends on a perfect note,1129680000,"10 19, 2005",2005,1176,"['sad', 'Wonderfalls', 'was', 'canceled', 'prematurely', 'should', 'not', 'stop', 'anyone', 'checking', 'out', 'series', 'run', 'episodes', 'one-season', 'story', 'arc', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'note', 'will', 'leave', 'viewers', 'satisfied.The', 'acting', 'show', 'almost', 'uniformly', 'wonderful', 'though', 'made', 'up', 'largely', 'name', 'actors', 'unknown', 'star', 'Caroline', 'Dhavernas', 'down', 'smaller', 'parts', 'such', 'brother', 'played', 'Lee', 'Pace', 'who', 'excellent', 'part', 'far', 'different', 'amazing', 'role', 'film', 'Soldier', 'Girl', 'season', 'arc', 'Jaye', 'flirtation', 'jilted', 'bartender', 'cute', 'actually', 'least', 'interesting', 'thing', 'show', 'due', 'large', 'part', 'one', 'poor', 'casting', 'choice', 'rather', 'boring', 'Tyron', 'Leitso', 'rest', 'show', 'smart', 'funny', 'Jaye', 'character', 'growth', 'relationship', 'especially', 'interactions', 'parents', 'brother', 'sister', 'manage', 'strike', 'perfect', 'balance', 'sarcastic', 'funny', 'witty', 'weird.If', 'only', 'caught', 'show', 'tv', 'pick', 'up', 'wealth', 'unaired', 'episodes', 'never', 'saw', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'out', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'series']",N/A

866999,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B0006GAO18,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[9, 9]","It's kind of strange, I remember about one year and six months ago (January 2004), I had just picked up my Firefly: The Complete Series boxed set, even though I had never seen an episode of the show.  I was perplexed as to why FOX released a cancelled show on DVD, but I found many positive reviews of the show online (even at Amazon), so I decided to check it out.  I was very lucky, as Firefly is now one of my favorite shows, and I am eagerly awaiting the complete version of Serenity, the movie spin-off (I've already seen an advance screening of a rough cut, and it was great, but I digress).Anyway, at about the same time, commercials started to appear on FOX about a new show called Wonderfalls, with Tim Minear as an executive producer (he also worked on Firefly).  I thought that it looked bizarre, but interesting.  Although, I never really got around to watching it because it had a really terrible timeslot (Fridays I believe).  Friday nights are known as the ""death slots"" because no new show can survive being on Friday nights, because no one watches TV on a Friday night.  Even shows with established audiences have trouble; Boston Public was a show on FOX that was very popular for a few years, but when it was moved to Friday nights, viewership completely evaporated.  So in a sense, FOX killed Wonderfalls before it even aired.  Only 4 of the 13 completed episodes ever made it to the airwaves, and it is truly sad.Wonderfalls tells the story of Jaye Tyler (Caroline Dhavernas), a textbook definition of a Gen-Y girl.  Despite the fact that she graduated from Brown with a philosophy degree, she has decided to live in a trailer and work at a Niagra Falls gift shop called Wonderfalls.  She does this because there is never any pressure to do anything greater than she already is.  This doesn't sit well with her family, all of whom are over-achievers, and all of whom have rhyming names.  There's her father Darrin (William Sadler), who is a doctor, mother Karen (Diana Scarwid), a famous author, sister Sharon (Katie Finneran), a lawyer, and brother Aaron (Lee Pace), who's getting his doctorate in comparative religions (yet his own faith will shock and surprise you).  Rounding out the cast is Jaye's friend Mahandra (Tracie Thoms), who is a cocktail waitress at The Barrel, a bar and restaurant, and tends to take free drinks from the bar.  Also, there is the love interest, Eric Gotts (Tyron Leitso), who came to Niagra on his honeymoon, only to find his wife Heidi (played in later episodes by the adorable Jewel Staite) giving her own kind of room service to a bellboy at their hotel.Anyway, things are going great for Jaye (by her standards anyway), until one day when a misformed wax lion statue opens its mouth and tells Jaye to do something.  Thinking that she's hearing things, Jaye obviously goes against the advice, but in doing so, it causes a woman to get mugged.  Soon after, more and more animal figurines begin talking to Jaye, telling her to do things.  Sometimes the messages are cryptic, sometimes they have double meanings, and sometimes, they are exactly what they seem.  But every time Jaye follows their advice, something good (eventually) happens to the people around her.This is, surprisingly, a very funny show.  The characters are all fairly witty, especially Jaye, who is sarcastic (yet never mean) and lazy.  Also, a lot of the situations are pretty funny themselves.  I mean, whoever thought that wanting a pancake could have such dramatic effects on the peole around you?  It's too bad that this show wasn't even given a chance.  Yes, it is quoirky and bizarre, but I like shows like that, and I don't think that enough people give these kinds of shows a chance.  As I said at the beginning of this review, FOX had its own hand in killing this show, but the level of quoirkiness in this show probably didn't sit well with mainstream audiences (and that is truly a shame).  Fortunately, the writers were aware of this, and they wrote a fairly contained first season (there aren't any major plot points that will never be resolved, such as in Firefly [although the new films will be answering some questions] or Tru Calling).  Although, that doesn't mean that they weren't ambititous; the writers had plot lines planned out seasons in advance.  On the DVD, they discuss some of them, and there are articles floating around on the internet discussing some of the future stories.Like with Firefly, I had never seen an episode of this show prior to buying the DVD set.  However, I'm very glad that I did.  This is a fun and interesting little show.  It is very funny, and also has its share of dramatic moments.  It definitely isn't for everyone, but there are many more people who have never seen it who would definitely enjoy it.",5,"Unfortunately, Wonder Fell",1117756800,"06 3, 2005",2005,4779,"['kind',

(Okay, I haven't got a Nielson box and so don't count ratingswise, but I still feel kinda bad.)I was mildly impressed when the show aired (in a dreadful timeslot, if I recall). Now having seen the whole series, I know what I missed, what with the FOX network's tinkering with plot and airing the episodes out of order. Wonderfalls is a truly unique and delightful show, with great plot and acting. I'm grateful to it for introducing Dhavernas to a US public that would otherwise likely remained unaware of her. She's phenomenal, (especially considering English is her second language, I believe. I'd never have known). She brings heart, vulnerability and real likeability to a character that is pretty unlikeable, at least to begin with. (Not to mention Katie Finneran, who plays her character hilariously and endearingly, and, most important, with the LEAST amount of stereotyping I've ever seen for a gay character ever.)Sadly, there was not room on the Friday night lineup for two young ladies hearing mystical voices from the universe, and Wonderfalls was trounced and destroyed by ""Joan of Arcadia"" (also a lovely show, except I resent it now, in retrospect. Not Joan's fault.) We like our fantasy in moderation in the US, it seems -- our loss.I like to think the cast and crew might have kept up this level of quality for several seasons. Poor Tim Minear -- Wonderfalls AND Firefly within a couple of years!(Great, now I feel worse -- I also ignored Firefly when it was on the air...)But at least we've got the full DVD set now. We as viewers can have closure (the DVDs end on a natural and pretty cheerful note considering it's a rather dark last episode, so you don't feel like it's a cliffhanger at all) and muse about what might have been (by all means, view the extras and listen to the commentary! I wish there had been more -- some of the extras kind of repeated info a bit too much -- but they do a decent job: a behind the scenes featurette, an odd little music video of the theme song, and charming commentary on about five of the episodes.

867006,AR37967IAR6ZT,B0006GAO18,Benjamin,"[14, 14]","""Wonderfalls,"" a terrific, innovative show that debuted on Fox in April of 2004, was unceremoniously canceled after four episodes. Despite massive amounts of critical acclaim, the show was coupled with a crappy reality game show on Friday nights. Then it was barely even given time enough to develop a giant cult following, which is a shame because ""Wonderfalls"" coulda and shoulda been a contender.Luckily for all of us, ""Wonderfalls"" has been granted a bit of a reprieve. All of the 14 completed episodes of the show, including the hilarious pilot and some fantastic episodes that never even aired, are now available in this DVD box set for a fairly reasonable price.The plot of the show is really trippy, but its execution works and is very, very amusing. Jaye Tyler is an ""overworked and unemployable"" graduate of Brown University with a philosophy degree. Because she saw that her entire family of overachievers is perpetually stressed out and annoyingly quirky, Jaye decided that she didn't want to get an actual job, so she works a dead-end retail job at a souvenir store in Niagara Falls - even though she hates dealing with people at all. Jaye also lives in a trailer park.In the first episode, after nearly choking to death on a peanut-butter sandwich, the souvenirs start speaking to her. Like, little wax lions or stuffed animals start to open their mouths and talking to her. They give her cryptic messages. They offer her advice. And they let her know that, if she doesn't do what they want, there will be wicked consequences.Things change for Jaye through this, and she's not able to continue being a do-nothing who's good for nothing. She actually starts, um, helping people and making the world a better place - even though she's still a bitter, angry cynic.Her family and friends, played by a great ensemble of actors (including the genius Katie Finneran as Jaye's tightly wound sister), are all baffled by this change in behavior. But it leads to some particularly funny, surprisingly twisted episodes.And the best part of this box set is that all of the episodes ever made lead up to an actually satisfying conclusion. I mean, you're not left hanging with some cliffhanger, wondering what happened between Jaye and bartender Eric ... or what the point of it all is. It's a great, great box set.So, if you are reading this, I suggest you buy ""Wonderfalls"" immediately. I mean, like, now. Put it in your shopping cart. Or on your wish list, at least. Go ahead. Please. Imagine that I'm a talking stuffed animal or a wax lion figurine, and imagine that I'm giving you advice.

867011,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B0006GAO18,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[6, 8]","If, in ten million years, aliens come to planet Earth and find a husk of humanity that used to live here and dig up a TV set and DVD player, I pray that Wonderfalls is inside it. Why? Because this story is as human as it gets.Similar to Dead Like Me (which at least aired two seasons on Showtime before being yanked), this story shows the human condition in a funny, touching, and dramatic fashion, but without getting hamfisted by dialogue and/or prankish material.The story revolves around Jaye Tyler (Caroline Dhavernas), a twentyish-year-old woman who's graduated from Brown University, and has an overachieving and overbearing family. Having such a wonderful education and incredible family, one would think that she'd be running a Fortune 500 company. But no. She works at a cheesy gift shop in Niagra Falls, New York and lives in a trailer park. She seems happy to let life slip on by and be the proverbial underachiever in a constant alter-ego fashion to her family's wishes. But life has other plans for Jaye. After suddenly losing out on a managerial position to a zit-faced coworker, Jaye suddenly begins to hear inanimate objects speak to her (a wax lion, pink lawn flamingos, a bronze monkey bookend, a stuffed lizard, etc.), and they tell her to do really bizarre things... like not giving someone a refund who obviously deserves it, or throwing wine on an old high school friend's dress during a reunion, or getting a disenfranchised nun back into her convent. The list goes on for thirteen amazingly brilliant episodes. And each event (whether Jaye likes it or not) pulls her closer and closer to being a more integrated member of the human race.Added to the story is a lot of nice little nooks and crannies known as side-stories. First, and foremost, is Jaye's family. Her author mother, Diane Scarwid, hits the perfect pitch, worried about her daughter, but also worried about her own writing career. Her physician father, William Sandler, is brilliantly portrayed as the head of the household, trying to save Jaye from herself and getting glimpses of his other daughter's (Kate Finneran) lesbian activities. Jaye's brother, Lee Pace, is a theology major and is the first to glimpse Jaye's strange conversations with coffee creamers and the like.Secondly, and thankfully, there's the love of Jaye's life - played perfectly by Tyron Leitso - waiting in the wings. They're both damaged people who just might make one whole person if they can ever get their lives together (the show weaves us in and out of their on-again off-again relationship and I, for one, cheered whenever they got close to one another).The fact that this beautifully done series got cancelled after only four episodes should be labeled as a crime.

I almost didn't make it all the way through the first DVD, with the first four episodes.  The problem was the character of Jaye, our protagonist.  She is a very difficult character to write, and act; she rides the thin line between being a charming free spirit and an annoying self-centered narcissist, between being likeable and unlikeable.  Jaye's character difficulty sprang not from any lack of skill on the part of the writers or the actress, but from the sheer complexity of the character and the fact that it takes some practice to get a unique character like that right.Once ""Wonderfalls"" gets over the speed bump that is the first 2-3 episodes, the show really hits its stride.  During a broadcast run, a show only has that many episodes to build an audience; hence, its failure on TV.  But we can enjoy the DVD knowing that it gets better.  Funny, creative, and well-written and performed, ""Wonderfalls"" deserved better than it got, but at least we get to see it on DVD.  ""Wonderfalls"" prefigures ""Pushing Daisies"" in tone.  Fans of that show will probably enjoy ""Wonderfalls"", and should feel comfortable renting this or buying it outright.  ""Wonderfalls"" is one of the rare television shows that can surprise you, which I like; it's not cookie-cutter at all.

""Wonderfalls"" is a quirky, cutsie show about a girl who works in a souvenir shop in Niagara Falls when the inanimate animals begin talking to her. It has a nice misanthropic streak, which I enjoyed, and a love of family values, which I did not enjoy. Unfortunately not enough people jumped on the bandwagon when it was originally aired as it only lasted one season. It's a shame too because I could see the show getting better as it went along.In the early part of the season the show is very episodic. Characters are introduced only when they are going to be used and then they disappear forever. Story arches are nonexistent. These episodes do have their charms. Jaye (Caroline Dhavernas) our main character has a girl show up who tries to take on her entire personality. It works on a Twilight Zone level. I also enjoyed the episode where a young boy orders a mail order bride and then turns to view Jaye and her friends as a blockade to his true love. Then, about two thirds of the way through, the show slightly changes tone. The talking toys play less of a role and we begin to dig deeper into Jay's personal life. The emergence of Heidi, the cheating wife of Jay's love interest, brings a dark edge that makes the show stronger. Suddenly plotlines continue from one episode to the next. We don't get a true ending, but it's no big loss. This show isn't about complex stories. It's about sitting still for an hour with the company of Jaye and having a fairly decent time.Dhavernas does make a loveable Jaye. She is at times too stiff (but that goes for the whole production) and too theatrical, but I still thought the casting was impeccable. There's probably a little too much acting going on with her mouth, but this is a minor complaint. It is interesting that a network would be so bold as to build a show around a retail worker (they prefer doctors), but they just can't help but to judge her. There are tons of people in this country who do work in retail and live in trailer parks, and they certainly don't need to be condescended to by a show that purports to be about them. For Jaye to move away from those traits would be to move towards her parents traits. But in my eyes being rich, Republican, and unlikable is no real prize. Besides isn't the theme of the show ""Surrender to Destiny""? Jaye listens to the animals, but they only talk to her because she listens. Point being that the number of things in this world that you actually have control over is so small there is no use is fighting for control of your destiny. Most things work out for us in the end anyways. And if you are in the retail industry just think of it as your destiny, and count your blessings that your destiny isn't digging coal in China.",3,Wonder Wonder Wonder Wonder Why,1164412800,"11 25, 2006",2006,2842,"['will', 'admit', 'had', 'idea', 'show', 'even', 'existed', 'friend', 'loaned', 'entire', 'series', 'few', 'weeks', 'back', 'Wonderfalls', 'quirky', 'cutsie', 'show', 'girl', 'who', 'souvenir', 'shop', 'Niagara', 'Falls', 'when', 'inanimate', 'animals', 'begin', 'talking', 'nice', 'misanthropic', 'streak', 'enjoyed', 'love', 'family', 'values', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'enough', 'people', 'jumped', 'bandwagon', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'aired', 'only', 'lasted', 'one', 'season', 'shame', 'too', 'could', 'see', 'show', 'getting', 'better', 'went', 'early', 'part', 'season', 'show', 'very', 'episodic', 'Characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'only', 'when', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'used', 'then', 'disappear', 'forever', 'Story', 'arches', 'are', 'nonexistent', 'episodes', 'do', 'have', 'charms', 'Jaye', 'Caroline', 'Dhavernas', 'main', 'character', 'girl', 'show', 'up', 'who', 'take', 'entire', 'personality', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'level', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'episode', 'where', 'young', 'boy', 'orders', 'mail', 'order', 'bride', 'then', 'view', 'Jaye', 'friends', 'blockade', 'true', 'love', 'Then', 'about', 'two', 'thirds', 'way', 'show', 'slightly', 'tone', 'talking', 'toys', 'play', 'less', 'role', 'begin', 'dig', 'deeper', 'Jay', 'personal', 'life', 'emergence', 'Heidi', 'cheating', 'wife', 'Jay', 'love', 'interest', 'dark', 'edge', 'show', 'stronger', 'Suddenly', 'plotlines', 'continue', 'one', 'episode', 'next', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'true', 'ending', 'big', 'loss', 'show', ""n't"", 'about', 'complex', 'stories', 'sitting', 'still', 'hour', 'company', 'Jaye', 'having', 'fairly', 'decent', 'time.Dhavernas', 'make', 'loveable', 'Jaye', 'times', 'too', 'stiff', 'whole', 'production', 'too', 'theatrical', 'still', 'thought', 'casting', 'was', 'impeccable', 'probably', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'acting', 'going', 'mouth', 'minor', 'complaint', 'interesting', 'network', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'bold', 'build', 'show', 'retail', 'worker', 'prefer', 'doctors', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'judge', 'are', 'tons', 'people', 'country', 'who', 'do', 'work', 'retail', 'live', 'trailer', 'parks', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'condescended', 'show', 'be', 'Jaye', 'move', 'away', 'traits', 'would', 'be', 'move', 'towards', 'parents', 'traits', 'eyes', 'being', 'rich', 'Republican', 'unlikable', 'real', 'prize', 'Besides', ""n't"", 'theme', 'show', 'Surrender', 'Destiny', 'Jaye', 'animals', 'only', 'talk', 'Point', 'being', 'number', 'things', 'world', 'actually', 'have', 'control', 'over', 'so', 'small', 'use', 'fighting', 'control', 'destiny', 'Most', 'things', 'work', 'out', 'end', 'are', 'retail', 'industry', 'just', 'think', 'destiny', 'count', 'blessings', 'destiny', ""n't"", 'digging', 'coal', 'China']",N/A

And if they didn't know what to do with you, like Firefly before it, you were shoved into Fridays because you were not called 24, American Idol or Paris Hilton. Wonderfalls died because it was brilliant, well crafted, wonderfully acted (Caroline Dhavernas is so dead on perfect) that Berman and her yes men did not know what to do with the show. It deserved a better timeslot (Sundays in the old The X Files timeslot seemed logical) and better promotion. I will treasure this show (along with ABC's short lived Miracles) because as much as American Idol and CSI bring in high ratings, at the end of the day you are left empty because they are equivalent to Easter peeps.

When I heard that Bryan Fuller had created a show called WONDERFALLS, I had my doubts that it could possibly be anywhere near as good as DEAD LIKE ME.Well, I was pleasantly surprised.WONDERFALLS shares a lot of similarities with DEAD LIKE ME -- slacker girl learning how to grow up and connect with those around her through some very strange things that happen to her.  Jaye Tyler and George Lass are very much the same character, and that is a wonderful thing for those of use who love that character.Few series can be both hilariously funny and heartbreakingly touching in the same episode, yet WONDERFALLS does it time after time.  There isn't much on television that makes me laugh out loud (especially more than once or twice in a show), but WONDERFALLS gets laughs out of me at least a dozen times in each show.  Yet I have to keep a box of tissues nearby, because the show can reach out and grab you by the emotions without warning.And while we were blessed with two seasons of DEAD LIKE ME, there were only 13 episodes of WONDERFALLS, so we don't get the opportunity to see the growth of the characters that we should have.So I'd recommend that everyone give this series a chance -- whether you have expectations for the show or not, you'll enjoy it.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[206, 226]","""Wonderfalls"" was one of those outstanding cult shows that burn bright and briefly -- it lasted only four episodes before being yanked, with nine more as yet unaired. Now fans of this cult show are rewarded with the full series, in all its witty, quirky glory.Twentysomething Jaye Tyler (Caroline Dhavernas) is an underachieving slacker. She has a philosophy degree from Brown University, but now works as a shopgirl at Niagara Falls and lives in a trailer. Needless to say, her ultra-successful family finds this galling and disturbing, even though they themselves are far from perfect -- her sister Sharon (Katie Finneran) is a lesbian, her parents are splitting, and her brother is just a weirdo.Then weirder things happen to Jaye. Suddenly toys are talking to her, and prompting her to help the people around her -- returning purses, dealing with ghosts, helping an old enemy from high school, and deal with a long-dead Indian girl. Following the instructions of her ""muses,"" Jaye begins to learn a few things about other people, and the quality of kindness.It's an unusual idea for a TV show -- an embittered young woman hears ""muses"" talking to her, including a stuffed lizard, lawn flamingos and a brass monkey. Most people would just check themselves into a padded cell, but that doesn't make for scintillating TV watching. So instead, it becomes a deeply warped inspirational series.What sets it apart from other series is the surreal touch and wicked sense of humor. It's never made clear why Jaye hears toys and bookends talking cryptically to her -- is it God? Aliens? Her own mind? Pantheistic souls in everything? Nothing is made specific, which makes it all the weirder and more intriguing -- especially since the toys give her advice even when she doesn't want it.And the humor can be beyond weird, but is always funny, such as Jaye arguing with a cow creamer (shades of P.G. Wodehouse?) that she doesn't want a pancake. Another example is a solemn, intense moment after she scatters a deceased person's ashes.... and promptly gets fined for littering. The dialogue is witty and well-written -- not in a laugh track way, but in a smile-and-chuckle-softly way.Caroline Dhavernas does a phenomenal job as Jaye. She narrowly avoids the sullen teen/twentysomething cliche, making Jaye's dissatisfaction with her family and life seem realistic. She can be nasty and incisive and angsty, but can also be sweet and even vulnerable. The supporting cast, such as nice-guy bartender Eric (Tyron Leitso) and Jaye's bizarro overachiever family, are surprisingly well-rounded for such quirky characters.""Wonderfalls"" is destined to remain a cult hit -- delicate, weird and thoroughly original.

Mostly I wanted to add my five stars to so many of the others.Rarely is any episodic TV show so consistently well-written. (Even Firefly had an embarrassingly poor episode about an interstellar whorehouse.) The writing would be for naught without great actors. I have some doubts about the African-American character -- I thought she tended to overplay her lines just a bit. But the rest were absolutely the best performances imaginable, making the absurd premise believable. The comedy does not strictly come from the dialogue itself. It comes from the fact that these lines perfectly fit the characters who speak them. The natural interaction between these well-drawn (if quirky) characters is the main source of the humor.I believe the Joan of Arcadia comparisons are apt. However, Joan was a dramatic program, and Wonderfalls is much more comedic, whimsical. They were both great shows, killed before their time by network stupidity.The Canadian woman who plays Jaye is impressive, and she would be a much better choice for many comedic roles than the famous American actresses who get those parts. It is just not fair that this talent is not a household name. She absolutely carried the show on her shoulders.

And I couldn't think of anything. What I liked about this show was the characters and the script. The instructions to Jaye from the animated creatures were almost always ambiguous yet somehow worked out for the best. Yet the situations never seemed forced or contrived.Jaye's family comes across as believable and endearing. They are well-played and provide support for Gen Y-er, Jaye. It is important for Jaye to have a supportive functional family so that it can be clear that the Gen Y anomie is a product of the times, a choice of the Gen Y-er, and not the social/family dysfunction.

That's nine that never aired on FOX in the United States. Now, you can find out just how the storylines that were set up were resolved (or partly resolved, anyway).For those that might not know, ""Wonderfalls"" is about a girl whose tried to almost completely cut herself off from her family and other social interaction by ignoring her psychology degree and taking a job as a retail clerk. But then, things with animal faces such as a wax lion or pink flamingoes start telling her to do things, such as to not give a customer her money back, or to help people with their problems. And often, these messages will turn out to have multiple meanings that may not be immediately evident. The program has some very offbeat humor and some it might be offensive to some, but much of it just downright hilarious. Though you might be taken aback at first, more than likely, it won't be long before you find yourself breathing ""I love this show!""Those who followed the show when it was on TV, but haven't yet seen all of it, will know all about Heidi. She was Eric's wife before she cheated on him with a bellman and he dumped her. Now, you'll finally get to see Heidi, as played Jewel Staite (who ""Firefly"" / Tim Minear followers will immediatley recognize.) Heidi is a quite a character and quite different from the engineer from ""Firefly.""You'll also watch the slow descent of Jaye as she continues to follow the muses' instructions, but pays a price when it comes to her sanity. If you only saw the first four episodes, you definitely haven't seen the best yet, and it's here for you. Without spoiling too much --- just try to imagine a Jaye who goes almost completely over the edge. You'll also witness great development for Eric, Jaye's friend Mahandra and Jaye's entire family.I can't complain about the DVD special features, really. While it might have been nice to have some deleted scenes, a lot of that stuff is available on the Internet anyway. The bonus features are really great. There's a documentary about the series, a short but sweet look at the visual effects and a music video of an extended version of the theme song. There's also six excellent commentaries. Unlike a lot of DVD commentaries, these aren't boring or stupid. You'll find about unfortunately unrealized plans for future seasons, editing that was done on the show, reasons for particular characterizations as well.If you haven't seen ""Wonderfalls,"" then get this for no other reason that it's a great show.

Jaye takes on some of the world's missteps and tries to right them with the cryptic advice of inanimate objects with faces.Now, although I loved this show, I typically love this kind of show, that is heavy on metaphor, and I love the reluctant hero, and frankly I like a complex romance, where love wins out. Also typically, my sweetheart hated this show for exactly the opposite reasons, so go figure. This is not a show for every one, but my guess is if you don't just hate it, then you will probably love it.About two thirds of the way through the discs, I thought that the show was losing it's way, but by the last episode, the story was neatly and satisfactorily tied up, giving a sense of completeness that many series lack by the time they are cancelled.

(I know she wasn't the main character on either show, but she was on both, and they were both MOST Excellent shows!) Either that, or FOX just doesn't know when they've got THE BEST tv show around! Those darn Nielsen ratings people aren't helping any, either. If they want to get a true sampling of what America watches, they need to follow what at LEAST half the country is watching, not just a miniscule fraction of it. Get with it, Nielsen! We're in the computer age! I am sure you could devise a way to put a website online and make it available to the WHOLE public, where they can register and tell you exactly what they watch. I remember being a kid, with my sister and I helping our mom fill out the ratings form in the tv guide and then mailing it in. Even when we didn't have a subscription to it, we would go out of our way to buy a tv guide when we heard it was ratings time! I'm sure plenty of people would spend five minutes or so logging onto your website and letting you know what they consider to be the cream of the crop. I'll even bet that you would get such a huge turnout that you wouldn't need your useless ratings boxes anymore, either!Firefly and Wonderfalls both had a truly excellent cast with magical chemistry abrewing, as well as awesome scriptwriters! I don't want to repeat what the other reviewers before me have said about the plot, but I really do have to give many kudos to everyone who worked on the show for making it immensely delightful to watch. I was always in suspense, trying to figure out what Jaye's goal was, and if she was finally going to get the guy or not. I taped all of the shows when they aired, and had to re-watch every single one of them over and over in order to keep from pulling my hair out while waiting for the next installment of the saga called Jaye. Although it ended up turning into a large mini-series with an ending (I thank the powers that be for the ending, or there would have been a massive let down after seeing the last show of the season and knowing there may never be one), there are still many possibilities for the show if another station ever decided to pick up where FOX left off.

867046,A3IVIS1OPYUU0X,B0006GAO18,Henry Perkins,"[60, 63]","[Summary: Too imaginative and quirky for FOX, but ""Wonderfalls"" is wonderful when you can view all 13 episodes.  Higly recommended.]""Wonderfalls"" is an episodic comedy, set in Niagara Falls, New York.  It's an ""hour"" (3/4 when subtracting commercial time) show, without a laugh track.  Highly innovative, it uses its setting to great effect, including using View-Master slides for act changes and tourist tchotchkies to inspire unexpected acts of compassion in a previously lackluster protagonist.OK, so you're a typical member of Generation Why Me, overeducated and undermotivated.  You've found the ideal job working in a Niagara Falls gift shop, where you figure if you show up for work you've accomplished enough for the day.  You just got passed over for Assistant Manager, losing out to a mouth breather who's still in high school.  And now the knick-knacks you're supposed to be selling are talking to you, telling you to do things.  You're not sure whether the voices are coming from God, Satan, or a tumor in your brain, but your biggest question is: ""Why me?"".That's Jaye Tyler, youngest and weirdest of a family living in Niagara Falls, New York.  Parents Darrin and Karen, sister Sharon and brother Aaron don't really understand Jaye.  And neither did the FOX Network, which jerked ""Wonderfalls"" around mercilessly in their schedule and then dropped it, airing only four episodes after paying for thirteen.  The people who buy new shows at FOX are a lot smarter than those (ir-)responsible for their schedules.  ""Wonderfalls"" fell victim to the FOX Friday Night Curse, joining ""M.A.N.T.I.S."", ""Firefly"", ""Space: Above and Beyond"", ""Strange Luck"", ""John Doe"", ""VR.5"", ""The Lone Gunmen"", ""Harsh Realm"", ""Sliders"", ""Brimstone"", ""Tru Calling"", ""The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr."", ""Alien Nation"", ""Roar"", ""Futurama"", ""Kindred: The Embraced"", ""Night Visions"", ""The Tick"", ""Werewolf"", and ""Wolf Lake"".  If you've got an idea for a strange new show, you might be able to sell it to FOX.  But expect to be pre-empted, moved to a different night, and have the episode order shuffled.  Bleah!Thank you for reading my rant about FOX, and now I promise to get back to reviewing the ""Wonderfalls"" DVD collection.  This includes three discs, with four episodes on Discs 1 and 2, and five on Disc 3.  If you managed to catch all four broadcast episodes you've still got nine more that will be new to you.  They include answers to questions like ""Will Jaye find true love?"", and yes, the all-important ""Why me?"".In addition to the full 13 episodes you'll get commentary on half of them from the same foursome: series star Caroline Dhavernas (""Jaye Tyler""), Katie Finneran (""Sharon Tyler""), and co-creators Todd Holland and Bryan Fuller.  Scotch Ellis Loring (""Dr. Ron Campbell"", plus the voice of various muses -- the talking animals) joins them on one commentary.  And there's even a music video, with Caroline and other cast members lip-synching their way through a rendition of the title song!I'm not going to spoil the actual 13 episodes for you, but I will note that in the commentaries you'll find out the plans for important elements of Season 2 (the lesbian pregnancy) & Season 3 (Jaye in the loony bin), plus character traits of the Tyler clan that never got to show up in Season 1.  Republican Party folk ballads, anyone?The video and audio are excellent.  While the broadcast episodes were cropped to fill the screen, they're presented in widescreen on DVD.The ""Wonderfalls"" cast is eclectic.  Caroline Dhavernas is a big star in her native Canada, but her repertoire pre-Wonderfalls is entirely dramatic.  Happily, she shows a real flair for comedy here.  Tyron Leitso (""Eric Gotts"") was the de facto hero (i.e. he survived) in ""House of the Dead"".  Katie Finneran mostly does stage work.  Lee Pace (""Aaron Tyler"") and Tracie Thoms (""Mahandra McGinty"") were Juilliard classmates.  William Sadler (""Darin Tyler"") was the bad guy in ""Die Hard 2"", the sheriff in ""Roswell"", and the mummy in ""Bordello of Blood"".  Diana Scarwid (""Karen Tyler"") has been acting professionally since 1977, but ""Wonderfalls"" is her only regular TV series.The locations are *almost* right.  Niagara Falls, Ontario substitutes for Niagara Falls, New York.  The interiors were shot in Toronto.  With environments this close to authentic the lighting and other aspects of exterior shots are wholly believable.If this spoiler-free review leaves you unsure whether to buy the ""Wonderfalls"" DVD collection, I apologize.  I recommend the show highly, and like it so much that I didn't want to detract from your enjoyment in the slightest.  It's hard to describe, but worthwhile to those who take a leap of faith.",5,"""Wonderfalls"" is wonderful!",1133654400,"12 4, 2005",2005,4691,"['[', 'Summary', 'Too', 'imaginative', 'quirky', 'FOX',

867048,A13DZQ0NPX855S,B0006GAO18,jancola,"[4, 4]","Why do great shows keep trying to survive on Fox?  Fox seems to have this idea that if a show doesn't succeed in its first four airings, two on Friday night and two against ""The Apprentice,"" that it is somehow unworthy?  They also seem to think that if a show can't survive despite little or no advertising that it isn't bankable.  If every network had this philosophy, neither ""Seinfeld"" nor ""Cheers"" would have made it past the first season!None of my friends ever even heard of this show.  I only knew about it because my boyfriend was working at MTV at the time; they were mailing out screeners and he snagged one.  After watching those four episodes, I knew the world had missed out, and I snatched up the DVD the instant it came out.The concept of this show is simple, and superficially sounds like ""Joan of Arcadia"": a higher power talks to Jaye Tyler through inanimate objects.  It is nothing like ""Joan of Arcadia,"" however.  Instead of being sentimental and obvious, the higher power of ""Wonderfalls"" is ambiguous and often rude.  Jaye is also a great character, a snarky slacker with a heart of gold, and some of the secondary characters are inspired, especially Jaye's family, although her friend's Mahandra and Eric are a little simplistic.Like ""Firefly"" before it, this was a brilliant, touching, original, and funny show written by talented people from team Angel that was cancelled before its time.  If you have ever seen ""Dead Like Me,"" this show is very similar in tone because it is also co-created by Bryan Fuller.  But unlike ""Dead Like Me"" and ""Angel,"" this show was easily accessible because it lacked the intense supernatural trappings and complex story arcs that make those shows hard for initiates to watch.This DVD collection is great.  I'm guessing it was put together by the same people as the ""Firefly"" discs, because it has the same slim packaging and the 5.1 mix was done by the same company (and it's a fun mix -- at times, voices in Jaye's head come from all over the room).  The unaired episodes are quite a bit better than the ones that were aired, as you will realize when you watch episode #6 (Lovesick Ass).  I haven't listened to the commentaries yet, but the fact that they exist is a big plus.All in all, this is a spectacular show, and I really don't understand why it was cancelled.  More than that, I don't understand why creators keep trying to sell their shows to FOX because if it isn't ""American Idol,"" they should know by now that's its going to be cancelled.",5,When will they learn...

It's a shame that off-beat shows that do something different get such a short time to develop. Firefly had the same fate, which is perhaps one of the best series ever brought to the small screen. Thank goodness for DVD that allows these series to exist beyond their original airings.What made this brief series so interesting is the fact that the lead character is cynical, somewhat selfish, and may be looking in all the wrong places for her place in life. She struggles with many of the same problems that haunt so many of us common folk. The quirky part of the show is the fact surrounding objects pressure her into doing the right things at the right time. Unlike Joan of Arcadia that is well intentioned but dull and dry, this series is unexpected and full of dry wit.People looking for a change of pace from the boring retred dramas on television will delight in this series.

867050,A9LHSB3NEXYBF,B0006GAO18,Jeannette,"[1, 3]","Having missed the series when it was broadcast on FOX network due to an evening work schedule, I recently purchased this DVD set because it is set in Niagara Falls, New York, where I lived for several years (in a trailer park, no less!) while just the same age as Jaye Tyler, the central character.  WONDERFALLS is exactly what many other reviewers have said it is: quirky, imaginative, funny, well-written, well-acted, etc.  It is also strictly ADULT fare, insofar as content goes, however, and NOT for family viewing.Now, having said all that positive stuff, here are some of the nit-picky details that only a [former] resident would notice:1.  Although the series is supposedly set in NF, NY, all of the locations seemed to be on the Canadian side of the border...which is just plain WRONG to anyone who has any idea of the geography involved.  So, when Jaye tosses a casket of ashes over the Falls in ""Barrel Bear,"" she's doing so on the wrong side of the Niagara River, and the Rainbow Bridge seen in the background is in the wrong place.  In ""Wound-Up Penguin,"" Jaye and Eric find themselves in a train station.  I muttered to myself, ""Niagara Falls has a train station THAT size?  Maybe in Buffalo!""  Or in Toronto, as it turns out.2.  Given the locations used for filming, and the fact that roughly half of the regular actors are Canadian, I wish the writers and producers would have just set the series in NF, ON, in the first place, and have done with it.  That way, they wouldn't have any grumpy Western New Yorkers complaining.  It's an old rivalry:Canadian:  ""WE have the better Falls!""  (Yes, they really CAN get pretty snotty about it!)American:  ""No, WE have the better Falls; you just have the better VIEW!""3.  None of the characters had the correct regional accent--flat and nasal, due to backed-up sinuses, no doubt--not even the one acted by the real, native Western New York actor, William Sadler.  Even the two characters who were supposed to be from New Jersey didn't sound right!4.  Jaye's old car--was it a Studebaker?--would not even EXIST, anymore, let alone still be on the road, especially without being washed frequently and housed nightly in a garage.  It would have rusted into powder decades ago, due to all the salt used on the roads in the winter.5.  Even Jaye's trailer park doesn't look right.  It looks more like an overnight RV park, given the haphazard way all the trailers are parked.  A real trailer park is divided into lots for efficient rental collection.  Furthermore, ""Muffin Buffalo"" features a trailer park resident who never bothered to level and block his trailer, so it rocks back and forth.  He tells Jaye it's got a broken axle, but I know what the real problem is--laziness, either his or the trailer's owner (if he happened to be a renter).6.  I never heard of Jaye and Mahandra's old high school, featured in ""Pink Flamingos,"" but they got the dynamics of interpersonal relations with old classmates down pretty well, nonetheless.  I guess that's not just a regional thing, though....  I did have a little chuckle in this episode--one of my old classmates did later do a turn as a city councilor, just as one of theirs did!7.  Only one street name mentioned in the series sounded familiar, Rainbow Boulevard.  The writers might have thrown a few more real street and place names into the scripts, just for the sake of atmosphere.  The Maid of the Mist doesn't count as a street or place name.8.  If you live or work anywhere within a mile of the Falls, their roar is a constant backdrop to your daily life, whether indoors or out, much like the sound of the subways/elevated trains are in New York City.  I never heard the Falls inside the Wonderfalls Gift Shop, or even immediately outside its door, which appeared to be only a matter of steps from the Falls.  (The gift shop's filming location was really in Toronto, as was The Barrel's.)In spite of all my trivial complaints, I still recommend this DVD set for adult viewers.

It caught the attention of many critics who praised everything dealing with the show. If only FOX would have put it in a proper timeslot so most people could catch it.Wonderfalls had some of the best writing I had seen in television in a while. Not because it was hard-hitting or even controversial, but because it was witty, fun, and entirely different. Jaye, one of the most independent people the world has probably known, begins to be pursued by inanimate objects (clay lions, stuffed animal donkeys, icons on t-shirts) to do their ""bidding."" And she has to either go insane or do what they say.Carolina Dhavernas is undeniably likeable as the lead. She has great comic timing. The first few episodes showed a lot of her sarcasm and reactions to the inanimate objects, but once a romantic storyline became involved, it literally surprised me to see her hit some of the emotional notes that she did. The rest of the supporting cast added MUCH more to the show. I would LOVE to go through and rave about each cast member, but I can just simply say that they all were amazing.I honestly cannot go into enough depth of how much I wish Wonderfalls could have continued. These 13 episodes set up so much depth and such interesting and different characters that when the last scene of the last episode was over, I was literally in tears.What could have been a whole new world much akin to the likes of Buffy and Charmed (but completely different) is now only confined into thirteen episodes. But thirteen episodes of amazing writing, great stories, unique characters, and true acting.""There's one thing really mystifying ... it's got me laughing and it's got my crying.""

I will admit that it was not exactly what I expected. I came across the show being a big fan of another wonderful but cancelled TV show created by Bryan Fuller, Pushing Daisies, and was looking for something similar to curb my TV on DVD addiction. Wonderfalls definitely did not disappoint. It wasn't quite what I expected, its a little more young adult oriented and isn't as family friendly as Pushing Daisies, but it was just as delightful in its own way as Pushing Daisies. The show features many scenes of fast-paced humorous dialogue, and each episode's individual plot was entertaining. I also was pleased to see that, just like Pushing Daisies, its takes a fantastical and somewhat magical concept, but doesn't push it into the territory of absurdity. Caroline Dhavernas did an excellent job playing the seemingly selfish and sarcastic, yet completely lovable, protagonist Jaye. And in addition, I also loved Lee Pace as Jaye's brother, Katie Finneran as Jaye's sister, and Diana Scarwid as the mother. The acting pretty much matched the superb script, and each episode left me wanting more. In the end, although the conclusion was satisfying, I can't help but wonder what might have happened if this show had stayed on the air for a couple more seasons.

But on Amazon.com discussion boards it got very high reviews, so I figured I would give it a shot. I am so glad that I did!  It was a very well written, extremely well acted show that was raved about by the critics that could not find a good time slot. It did not help matters at all that ""Joan of Arcadia,"" which has a similar premise, came out a week before this series aired; possibly stealing some of the potential audience for this series. ""Joan of Arkadia"" was also slightly more family oriented, and this series is definately for adults due to the language. In my opinion, the characters do take 3 or 4 episodes to grow on you (Jaye played by Caroline Dhavernas is particularly unlikeable in the first episode)  If you buy this, you will watch this several times, and laugh your head off.  It is worth your money.I will briefly list the episodes:Disk 1Wax Lion (episode 1, also has SF of commentary)Pink Flamingos (episode 2)Karma Chameleon (episode 3)Wound up Penguin (episode 4)Also, on Disk 1, there is a ""Greetings from Wonderfalls"" documentary.

Trust me, Wonderfalls was an amazing show that FOX just mishandled very badly: giving it a poor time slot on Fridays, little promotion, and yank it before it had time to really grow. But the fantastic creators and actors of this show were prepared for the worst and made sure to make the 13 episodes that FOX initially gave them a complete, wonderful story all on its own. Although if given a chance for more episodes this show could have really been a hit!! it really is such a shame.This show is hilarious and you can pop it into your dvd player anytime, to have you and your friends laughing your heads off. Plus, it is a show that you can quote all the time, much like Seinfield or Friends. Here are some examples of great lines in just the show's first episode:DR RON: Tell me about your family.JAYE: I really don't want to gossip.MAHANDRA, jaye's best friend, (to Jaye): You're spiteful in a way the definition of ""spiteful"" doesn't quite prepare you for.Mahandra: Why were you doing a good deed?Jaye: I wanted to see what it felt like.JAYE (about her family): Just look at them, they all work really hard and they're dissastified. -- I mean I can be dissastified without hardly working at all.Eric, love interest for Jaye: Well, for those of us not in cults, I think there's something to be said for surrendering to destiny. I mean if it's destiny there's probably a reason for it, right?Jaye: Okay.Eric: So why struggle with fate?

The concept is original and interesting - animal toys that reveal cryptic messages, and only one person hears them.  This was actually the best part of the show.  What do these messages really mean, and what will happen if Jaye follows or doesn't follow their instructions?  I especially liked the instances when Jaye thought she was following their instructions, only to find out after some mishap that her assumptions were wrong.  I think the show would have been better if this concept was developed further and given more airtime.  Instead, it seemed like the show devolved into too much petty bickering and Gilmore Girls-style rapid, witty dialogue.  I guess most viewers like this, but I found it to feel very fake.  The characters' actions and reactions seemed very unnatural, and I attribute this to both mediocre scripts and mediocre acting.

I ran across this one while serching shows similiar to my current favorite series Pushing DaisiesPushing Daisies - The Complete First SeasonSo I rented it, and now I must own it. Put it this way I watched all 13 episodes in like a day and a half, I was floored I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this show. Every episode is better then the last, and so funny I laughed until I was coughing many times. Wonderfalls is one of those rare shows that only come around once in a while, where everything just seems to fit, and there's absolutely nothing you would change about the series. I'm sort of relieved that I missed the show when it aired, it disgusts me when brilliant shows like this one are passed over in favor of um...lets say shows that are more flash and less brain. Also, I got to miss out on the frustration of an incomplete story. I never saw the few episodes that aired, So I got to experience the series as a whole the way it was meant to be seen. I worried slightly over there being only 13 episoeds, thinking that when the credits roled on the finale I would feel like nothing was resolved and that I had wasted my time and money. Happily though, this was not the case. At the emd I was very satisfied there was and end, but not an ending. As though the story would go on to what ever end a viewer choose, even if they wern't there to see it. I love shows that end this way. I really can't say enough good things about this series.

Since, it's smartly written, well-acted, the cancellation had to be a given.Simply put, Wonderfalls is the story of Jaye Tyler, her family, and friends. Jaye is 24. She graduated from Brown with a philosophy and now works at Wonderfalls, a souvenir store in Niagara Falls and lives in a trailer. Her parents, sister, and brother are all type-A personalities who see Jaye as a black sheep of sorts, but still love her. Her best friend Mahandra works at the local watering hole, The Barrel, where Jaye meets Eric who's taken up bar-tending after discovering his new wife giving a hotel bellhop ""service"". Jaye's life follows a predictable pattern of being dissatisfied with life while doing the least she can. The pattern ends when a Wax Lion speaks to her.This complete series DVD set tracks Jaye's journey of becoming more involved in the world through speaking inanimate object shaped like animals.Is the show a little odd? Definitely! But, that's a huge part of the show's charm and a reason to watch. Bryan Fuller is going to end up creating some massive hit show (which may occur with his newest Pushing Daisies) and all the cool, smart people,i.e. fans of Wonderfalls and Dead Like Me, are going to say that they've always known what a creative mind he is.DVD content, not including episodes, is ok. Commentaries are all good. It's the featurettes that leave a bit to be desired.

Grifka ""GMan""","[7, 24]","The show concept and description are so alluring and esoteric, and I love the idea of a rational, intelligent, university educated (but aimless) young adult who places great value in guidance provided by inanimate objects....but alas, the show's casting, writing, and acting all reflect the desire to capture that all too familiar male 16 to 30 audience.The episodes are simple and redundant. There is little character development. Most characters are reduced to cultural and family stereotypes through poor acting and even worse dialogue. Shallow does not begin to describe Wonderfalls.On paper, Wonderfalls had the potential to be another Northern Exposure. Admittedly, the cinematography and set design/location choice are superb. But eye candy will only take you so far, and in the case of Wonderfalls, it was 4 episodes broadcast, and a premature archive of 8 (or 9) more.I made it through the first four episodes before putting the disc back in the box and listing it on a well known auction site.In the end, I was hard pressed for an answer to this question: ""Why does a 24 year old Brown graduate act like a 17 year old high school student and engage her friends, family, and colleagues in vacuous, drivelling conversation?Supposedly, the anchor character Jaye has a degree in philosophy, but can't bother to wonder at the miracle that allows her to communicate with inanimate object. My final conclusion is that the show is inanimate, and the flamingos profiled in the 2nd episode (who repeat ad nauseum 'Get off your ass') exist to encourage the viewer to do just that and find better narrative driven TV. There surely isn't worse.The included documentary on Wonderfalls is nothing more that absolute auto-fellatio from the major actors, producers, etc....on what a great show Wonderfalls was.

Tim Minear worked closely with Joss Whedon, and was the executive producer of Wonderfalls, so it makes sense to be that this show would be must see -- and it was.Jaye is a morose slacker in her 20s and is the odd woman out in her family of high achievers. She hides her fear of failure by not attempting to succeed and with cutting quips. Jaye, slacker ambitions aside, is just as clever as the rest of her family, perhaps more so and smart women are always needed in the TV landscape.And then she gets konked on the head and inanimate objects in the shape of animals start talking to her. Wax Lions, Cow Creamers, Stuffed Fish, and even characters on TV all want to advise her using enigmatic and misleading phrases -- all bets are off. Brain damage? Demon possession? Insanity? G-O-D?There is a certain courage in making a female lead less than Mary Tyler-Moore lovable, allowing her to be multidimensional, flawed, and occasionally witchy. Jaye is a less driven version of Emily Deschanel's character, Temperance, on Bones; at first glance she has too many sharp edges until you get to know her and realize the defense mechanisms at work.A TV set that has room for Gregory House certainly can have a place for Jaye, and Temperance, and interestingly imperfect women.Of course this show is not for everyone, but all the friends I've lent it to have loved it, and some have borrowed it more than once.

A book or a show that really touched me, that I feel will touch many others, were they to read/watch it.  ""Wonderfalls"" is that show.Though the four episodes were well written, entertaining, and at times very funny, I wasn't completely convinced by this show until the second disc.  Everything we loved about Buffy and Veronica Mars is here; the snark, the attractive characters, the drama, the hilarious dialogue... everything.  To my surprise, I slowly became attached to the characters and their stories, wondering how each plot would play out long after I shut off the DVD for the night.  Jaye is a one-of-a-kind character, played wonderfully by Caroline Dhavernas who took a a character that could have easily been a stereotypical slacker and played her as a sympathetic yet joyfully sarcastic reluctant hero.  Her situation--inanimate objects (with faces) talk to her and tell her to do things--is captivating as the shows premise, but it takes a back seat to the subtle drama between the cast of characters that plays out over the season, coming to a head in the series finale, ""Caged Bird.""Like ""Firefly"" before it, ""Wonderfalls"" was cut short early by the ruthless company that aired it, just becoming another one of those glorious yet rare shows that was axed way before its time.  This series is entertaining enough that you can watch multiple episodes in one sitting without getting restless, and the rewatchable factor is also extremely high.I hope that, running with the ""Firefly"" comparison, the cast and crew of this show are one day brought together for a full length film continuation of this show.

Given time, it would have found its audience.  But it was not given that chance.  The plot is about Jaye Tyler, college graduate stuck working retail in the Niagra Falls gift shop.  Jaye is rather self absorbed, cynical, and not very close with her family.  Not the type of character you would expect as the heroine of the series, but that's what made her so appealing, she was unique and she was real.  Inanimate animals beginning with a wax lion start talking to her, telling her to do good deeds and the show is off and running.  The messages are often cryptic.  That's where more of the fun is, trying to figure out the mystery.  Caroline Dhavernas as Jaye is a treasure.  She has the talent and charisma to carry the show alone. But she doesn't have to, the entire cast is excellent, not one weak link among them. Why Fox chose to cancel this show after four episodes while letting the vastly inferior Tru Calling (another fantasy show with a female heroine and with similar ratings) go on for a full season, I will never understand.Now, does Wonderfalls have any kind of future?  The three executive producers appeared at the 2004 Comiccon and showed episodes 5 and 6(lucky ones there didn't have to wait for the DVD to see those two episodes).  They said they would like to see Wonderfalls continue on in some form, just as Firefly did.  Firefly is another short lived series that Wonderfalls executive producer Tim Minear worked on with Joss Whedon.  It was cancelled before a full season, released on DVD, and this summer a big screen Firefly movie will be coming to theaters.  I read one of the big factors in Firefly getting a movie was...the high DVD sales.  So if there is any hope for Wonderfalls to come back in some form, the DVD needs to succeed.  Buy the DVD, get your friends and family to buy it, buy another one and give it as a gift. Each DVD sold helps. I bought a second one yesterday to give to my best friend.If you've never heard of Wonderfalls before, get this DVD you won't be disappointed.  And after you watch it you will feel the pain all of us that watched it felt when it was cancelled.  And you will want more.  If this DVD succeeds, maybe Wonderfalls may come back some way, if nothing else it will send a message to Fox what a mistake it was to cancel it.  And maybe send a message to all the networks about what kind of shows we want, and what kind we don't.  Fight crappy tv!

867098,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0006GAO18,Robert Moore,"[550, 566]","Warning:  Many spoilers.The 2003-2004 television season was one in which critics and fans expressed their growing outrage at the decay of standards in commercial television.  On the one hand, the WB decided to cancel the critically acclaimed ANGEL despite an unprecedented fan effort to save the show.  A growing stream of increasingly offensive reality shows made many wonder if there was any future for scripted television, or whether we were doomed to see shows like the widely condemned THE SWAN.  But for many, the low point of the entire season was the cancellation by FOX of the extraordinary new show WONDERFALLS after only four episodes, despite a host of great reviews, many of them proclaiming it the finest new show of the year.  More than this, it was as if FOX were determined for the show to fail, first placing it on Friday evenings (the worst night of the week for attracting viewers) for three weeks, before putting it on Thursday night opposite a host of the most popular shows on TV, therefore dooming it to low ratings.  With the great reviews, one would have imagined that FOX would have found the show a new time slot and built an advertising and promotional campaign around the critics' ravings.Luckily, WONDERFALLS is being released with the four original episodes and nine more that were completed but not released.  The great news for those who saw those first four shows is that the next nine are even better.  Indeed, if you were angry at the cancellation of the show based solely on those four episodes, you will go ballistic when you see how good these others are.  The writers were obviously in defense mode from the first.  One of the executive producers, Tim Minear, had been victimized the previous year when he served as executive producer of FIREFLY, which FOX similarly killed prematurely.  This time, they assumed that the thirteen episodes might be all they got.  As a result, WONDERFALLS is essentially a single self-contained story in thirteen parts.  It could easily have led to a second season with new story lines, but the one season they did produce tells a single tale, with no major loose ends at all by the end of the final one.As most who have heard of the show know, WONDERFALLS is the story of Jaye, a slacker living in Niagara Falls, NY (though most of the footage at the Falls is from the Canadian side) and working in a menial job in a souvenir gift shop.  Her life is mundane and unpromising, when suddenly one day inanimate animals start talking to her.  A lot of people who hear this aspect of the show are turned off, but trust me, it really won't be an issue for long for anyone who gives the show a chance.  We never do learn why the animals talk to Jaye (though in one spectacular episode a bronze monkey, in response to her question of why they are all singling her out, tells her, ""Because you listen"").  In one episode near the end of the season there are hints that Jaye might actually be a spirit seer, and if so it is highly satirical that in American consumer society that she would be addressed by artificial, utterly fake animals instead of the real animals that Native American seers acknowledged as spirit guides.The animals don't really give Jaye much choice in the matter of whether she is going to heed their commands.  She learns very quickly that if she doesn't do their bidding, they will drive her crazy by such stratagems as singing endlessly ""One Hundred Bottles of Beer On the Wall.""  She also learns that if she refuses to do their bidding, things can go very bad very quickly, and that if she does things can go miraculously right.  For instance, she is commanded to do a number of things through consecutive episodes that apparently destroy a potential relationship with Eric, the young bartender who came to Niagara on his honeymoon, only to have his wife (played by FIREFLY alum Jewel Staite, as unlovable in this role as she was adorable as Kaylee in that show) cheat on him their first night there.  Eric seems perfect for the prickly Jaye, but the animals don't seem to want to cooperate.  I won't give away the end of the series, but I think the final episodes end about as perfectly as one could hope.  After thirteen episodes in which Jaye has functioned as a pawn of fate, seeing her finally a little happy and content is a wonderful moment.The cast is absolutely first rate, and by the end of the series all make a great contribution.  Caroline Dhavernas is really fine as Jaye.  She is not supposed to be a good or lovable or nice person.  She definitely isn't a saint.  As she puts it in one episode, in which she inadvertently saves a baby from injury, ""I'm not a baby saver!""  She ends up being a good person despite her own best efforts to the contrary.  Tyron Leitso is enormously likable as Eric, who seems to be way too nice of a guy to be involved with a brat like Jaye.  But the chemistry between Jaye and Eric is great, especially as their relationship gets enormously complicated by life (and inanimate animals) later in the season.  At first I was alarmed that Jaye's family was going to play such a prominent role in the series, but all the performers were so exceptional that it ended up being one of the show's greatest assets.  William Sandler as her doctor father, Diane Scarwid as her author mother, and Kate Finneran as her lawyer sister (all three highly successful in their jobs) were great and serve to emphasize how unsuccessful in life Jaye has been..  And I really liked Lee Pace as her brother Aaron, a doctoral student in religion who is the first to catch on that Jaye has an unusual relationship with the powers that be via fake animals (something he first suspects when he catches her talking to a cow coffee creamer).  And Tracie Thomas is quite cute as Mahandra, Jaye's best friend and the surreptitious lover of Aaron (a fact only revealed to the other characters only in the final episode).This is one of my favorite series of all time, and while I profoundly regret that FOX didn't give it a chance, I am grateful that the producers managed to tell a brilliant and compelling story.  And I loved the setting in Niagara Falls.  It was one of those rare shows where very nearly everything was perfect, except that it appeared on a network run by the mentally challenged.  See this!  I promise one of the most enchanting experiences of your viewing life.",5,One of my all time favorite TV series - gone before its time,1099353600,"11 2, 2004",2004,6383,"['Warning', 'Many',

867099,A30X7VQZILMFZT,B0006GAO18,Sertorius,"[3, 3]","Boomtown and Wonderfalls have only two things in common; they were both the victims of short-sighted networks, and they were both superbly well-crafted. It is depressing to see that quality does not always bring an audience, Wonderfalls was at least designed to work well as a 13 part mini-series, with a distinct beginning, middle and end.Wonderfalls is the story of Jaye, an alienated, and over-educated member of generation-Y, who only works hard to evade responsibility in any manifestation. She has the talent to be successful, but would rather not expend and the effort and possibly be disappointed. Certainly her successful family give her no reason to believe that happiness follows success. Her inertia is disturbed only when animal shaped objects begin speaking to her and directing her actions. Jaye suspects schizophrenia, but begins to follow orders when ignoring the commands leads to disaster, while obeying always leads to desirable (and completely unpredictable) outcomes. Naturally all of this leads to a great of angst, and it is all sometimes painfully funny. The concept of the show works on two levels; on one we there is Jaye's particular assignment for the episode, where she is frequently called upon to perform a series of fairly insane actions to create a chain of events that make the world a better place. These are always entertaining and meticulously crafted, but I actually enjoyed the other level, which is the ongoing story of Jaye; her best friend Mahandra; Eric, the vulnerable bar tender; and Jaye's peculiar family. These interactions grow and progress throughout the season, and it becomes clear that Jaye's vocal animal friends have a deeper agenda to make all of these disparate pieces fit together in the right way. A pretty major undertaking given how dysfunctional this crew is, but very, very entertaining to watch. The acting and writing is universally stellar and the episodes keep getting better as you watch. Oh...

I read about the show's history, that it was cancelled after only four episodes aired, but a strong fan following lobbied for the release of the DVD, which features all thirteen episodes that were made.  I bought the DVD and the fans were right: the show is wonderful!The show is basically a retelling of Joan of Arc, and is much more clever and inventive than the longer-running ""Joan of Arcadia.""  Jaye (Caroline Dhavernas), an underachieving young woman who chooses to be a retail clerk at a gift show next to Niagra Falls despite her university degree, hears voices that tell her to do various things which don't make much sense at first, but always end up helping the other characters in the story in some unexpected way.  The voices come from inanimate animals (a stuffed bear, a wax lion, a brass monkey, etc.) who talk to Jaye simply because she listens (this is according to the brass monkey).Caroline Dhavernas, already a star in Canada, creates a wonderfully cynical, yet empathic character in Jaye Tyler.  Her family, including her lesbian lawyer sister (Katie Finneran), and her atheist divinity student brother (Lee Pace), are also fascinating to watch.  William Sadler gives a masterful performance as Jaye's dad, and Diana Scarwid is brilliant as Jaye's mom.The thirteen episodes tell an ongoing story that climaxes in the last few episodes.  The first few episodes introduce the characters and situations, and then each episode builds the story and becomes more and more interesting.  My family and I were going to watch a couple of episodes one night, and we ended up watching all of them and stayed up all night to see what would happen next.  The story is full of twists and turns, and when you think you have it all figured out, it changes and goes in an unexpected direction.It is a real shame this show was not given a fair chance.

Before you order or watch it, be advised, this is NOT some sappy, feel-good comedy (or drama) suitable for the whole family.  It's an offbeat, different, quirky and sometimes a little strange adult dramedy.  That being said, I loved it!  I also loved Joan of Arcadia, but this is NOT to be compared with that show (or any other).  I think too many people who disliked this show were expecting something more Disney-like and... that it ain't!  Although it's a fantasy, the main character, Jaye Tyler, is at times a slacker, a pessimist, a born loser, and a general disappointment to her family. But that's what makes it so interesting that the messages from the talking objects should be directed at her. Unlike Joan of Arcadia, you're never quite sure if it's all in her head or some greater force is at work here. And, unlike Joan, Jaye's goal in life seems to be getting by by doing as little as required of her and being as unhelpful to those around her as possible.  Sound familiar?  We all know people like this.  Why is everyone who hated the show so surprised by a character like this?

Not that I had much chance to catch it when it was on TV - Fox only aired four episodes before canceling it.Fox: Where great shows (like this) go to die.Seems like the kind of thing Fox does best.  Think Firefly, one of the best sci-fi shows produced in modern times, another show they canceled before it had time to grow legs. And they wonder why - they show episodes out of order, against established shows, switch the times around so viewers can't follow, and then wonder why the ratings are low.  My advice to all those great writers and producers out there creating great programs like this for Fox: Make sure you secure the rights to have another network (with brains) pick up your series after Fox dumps you.But this is besides the point.  Let's just put it this way - this is yet another quirky, unusual, and stimulating program that you didn't get to watch because of the Fox boneheads (who need to be stopped before they kill again).Combine the oddball humor of Boston Legal and Northern Exposure, throw in a little magical realism and twenty-something angst, and you get something like Wonderfalls, a show about Jaye, a cynical under-achieving Brown University philosophy graduate who's been tasked by unknown powers (speaking through various animal figures and stuffed toys) to help people in sideways directions.  It is the latter - the sideways directions combined with the great acting of the major leads - that makes the show work.  The problems to be fixed and the paths to a solution are never obvious.  Instead, viewers watch as Jaye stumbles along trying to figure out what it is she's supposed to do and why.On the DVD extras the producers noted that they had storylines going all the way into three seasons. Apparently Jaye was going to end up in a mental institution.  A satirical modern odd-ball variation of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest comes to mind.

The main character (Jaye) really ruined the show for me.  She's annoying, tactless, and tries so hard to pass for cute it makes her scenes almost excruciating to watch.  The show's saving grace is it's supporting cast.Just to clarify- I did watch all of the episodes hoping it would get better and there were some entertaining moments, but not enough to warrant an above average rating.  I think this show had too many writing and production problems and tried to focus on too select of an audience. It also felt very dated at times (while watching I got the sense that it was a mid 90's show but was surprised to see that it was made in 2004).Overall, ""Wonderfalls"" lacks the charm and wit of Fuller's ""Pushing Daisies"".  I recommend purchasing the latter instead.",2,Very Disappointed.....,1233619200,"02 3, 2009",2009,878,"['enjoy', 'Bryan', 'Fuller', 'Pushing', 'Daisies', 'talented', 'Lee', 'Pace', 'Wonderfalls', 'was', 'big', 'disappointment', 'main', 'character', 'Jaye', 'really', 'ruined', 'show', 'annoying', 'tactless', 'tries', 'so', 'hard', 'pass', 'cute', 'scenes', 'almost', 'excruciating', 'watch', 'show', 'saving', 'grace', 'supporting', 'cast.Just', 'clarify-', 'did', 'watch', 'episodes', 'hoping', 'would', 'get', 'better', 'were', 'entertaining', 'moments', 'not', 'enough', 'warrant', 'above', 'average', 'rating', 'think', 'show', 'had', 'too', 'many', 'writing', 'production', 'problems', 'tried', 'focus', 'too', 'select', 'audience', 'also', 'felt', 'very', 'dated', 'times', 'watching', 'got', 'sense', 'was', 'mid', '90', 'show', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'was', 'made', '2004', '.Overall', 'Wonderfalls', 'charm', 'wit', 'Fuller', 'Pushing', 'Daisies', 'recommend', 'purchasing', 'latter', 'instead']",N/A
867109,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0006GAO18,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[7, 9]","Quirky, funny and unusual all perfectly describe this hour long Fox dramady that got the ax way too soon. It would have made a perfect companion piece to the dry ""Dead Like Me"" on Showtime. Jaye Tyler (Carlone Dhavernas)works in a deadend job as a retail clerk in a Niagara Falls shop. After a misdirected quarter grants her the ability to hear wax lions, stuffed toys, hairpins and lawn flamingos to talk to her. It seems they all represent some sort of spirit that wants her to do good for other people. The only problem is that their message is never exactly clear which means she does ultimately triumph but not without some comic consequences. Truly one of the best shows missed by the masses, ""Wonderfalls"" belongs in the same category as shows like ""Northern Exposure"" and features the same comic sensibility. With terrific performances by Kate Finneran as Jaye's sister, Diana Scarwid as her mother, Tyron Leitso as her potential boyfriend Eric and William Sadler as her high achieving supportive but mystified father and top notch direction from Todd Holland ""Wonderfalls"" didn't fail to deliver it just wasn't given the chance to succeed in rounding up viewers. Fox only aired 4 episodes before cancelling the series (although the other 9 produced for the first season are included).The DVD features the series in a widescreen presentation with exceptional clarity and color. The extra features are a bit meager but fans aren't picking up this three DVD set for the special features. There's a short featurette on the visual effects, a wonderful music video featuring Andy Partridge's (of the band XTC)odd but charming theme song (we get to hear the entire three minute song vs. the snippet used in the title sequence) and six commentary tracks featuring members of the cast, director/co-producer Holland and others. There's also a short documentary included on disc one entitled ""Greetings from Wonderfalls"". It features interviews with co-creators Holland & Fuller, cast members and we see snippets of the audition tape featuring Dhavernas. Partridge provides very brief comments on the song (he isn't seen)and it sounds like it was pulled from the introduction to his demo tape.My only complaint is the packaging. Like ""Tru Calling"", Fox has elected to put two discs in one container in this set. I'm just afraid that this economic move will cause damage to the discs due to wear and tear over time. There's no booklet although there's plenty of information on the individual episodes on the back of each DVD holder. The packaging is, for the most part, exceptionally good with great graphics and a nice cardboard case to store the individual DVD holders in.Well made, funny, tender and totally off the wall at times ""Wonderfalls"" burned brightly but too briefly. Just a warning to parents--there's a couple of minor bad words that appear in a new of episodes so it's best if they watch this after the toddlers are in bed otherwise they might hear a couple of nasty words the next day leaping out of their mouths.
