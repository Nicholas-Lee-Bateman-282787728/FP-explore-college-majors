Seeing Iron Man portrayed as a teenager (very Spider-man like) is a good idea.

1623485,ACWI476GB6NT3,B00B9LNPUQ,John S. Kjellman,"[0, 0]","Though short lived this series was a nice reboot to the Ironman story.  Basically Tony Stark is now a teenager using his Ironman technology to gain back control of Stark Industries.  I won't say much more so as not to spoil any plot lines but suffice it to say a few arch enemies are also now the children of some evil person.Nice touch as it probably relates to the kids better.  Definitely makes for an interesting Ironman based story line.Animation is a bit &#34;computer generated&#34; looking, switching from excessively detailed shots to some that are more akin to a modern video game.  This seems to be a common theme with many cartoons/anime lately, not bad but annoying to some.",5,It's Ironman,1376352000,"08 13, 2013",2013,687,"['short', 'lived', 'series', 'was', 'nice', 'reboot', 'Ironman', 'story', 'Basically', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'now', 'teenager', 'using', 'Ironman', 'technology', 'gain', 'back', 'control', 'Stark', 'Industries', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'not', 'spoil', 'plot', 'lines', 'suffice', 'say', 'few', 'arch', 'enemies', 'are', 'also', 'now', 'children', 'evil', 'person.Nice', 'touch', 'probably', 'kids', 'better', 'Definitely', 'interesting', 'Ironman', 'based', 'story', 'line.Animation', 'bit', '34', 'computer', 'generated', '34', 'looking', 'switching', 'excessively', 'detailed', 'shots', 'are', 'more', 'akin', 'modern', 'video', 'game', 'be', 'common', 'theme', 'many', 'cartoons/anime', 'lately', 'not', 'bad', 'annoying']","Iron Man: Armored Adventures, Complete Season 2"
1623486,A23LP9CTPKUDH5,B00B9LNPUQ,Marcus Smith,"[0, 0]",Season Two of Iron Man - Armored Adventures continues a few months after the end of the first. Tony Stark changes a lot by character but still leaves room for his wit and charm.  I would give away too much regarding appearances from select charactersand a few `What If' moments but very worthy of Iron Man atmosphere.  This will stay in my DVD collection and easily a `marathon'selection.,5,Iron Man - Part 2,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,388,"['Season', 'Two', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Armored', 'Adventures', 'few', 'months', 'end', 'first', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'lot', 'character', 'still', 'room', 'wit', 'charm', 'would', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'regarding', 'appearances', 'select', 'charactersand', 'few', 'What', 'moments', 'very', 'worthy', 'Iron', 'Man', 'atmosphere', 'will', 'stay', 'DVD', 'collection', 'easily', ""marathon'selection""]","Iron Man: Armored Adventures, Complete Season 2"

1623488,A20X74FQDOPRYM,B00B9LNPUQ,Shurron Farmer,"[2, 2]","In my opinion, over the past 10 years most action-oriented animated series can't seem to last ay most 2 seasons. To name a few: Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes, Spectacular Spider-Man, Thundercats (2011 Series), Young Justice, Green Lantern, Wolverine and the X-Men, Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes. He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (2002-03 Series), and the Super Hero Squad Show.I thought Iron Man: Armored Adventures was a great series, especially when I was initially reluctant to watch yet another show whose lead character had been made younger as part of the plot. Nevertheless, this made for great stories and for great appearances by other Marvel characters including Hawkeye, Black Widow, Black Panther, Dr.Doom, and the Hulk. I yearn for the time when an action-oriented animated series will last for more than 2 seasons again.",4,"Another good Marvel animated series falling victim to the ""Two Season Curse""",1369958400,"05 31, 2013",2013,855,"['opinion', 'past', '10', 'years', 'most', 'action-oriented', 'animated', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'last', 'ay', 'most', '2', 'seasons', 'name', 'few', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'World', 'Greatest', 'Heroes', 'Spectacular', 'Spider-Man', 'Thundercats', '2011', 'Series', 'Young', 'Justice', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Wolverine', 'X-Men', 'Avengers', 'Earth', 'Mightiest', 'Heroes', 'He-Man', 'Masters', 'Universe', '2002-03', 'Series', 'Super', 'Hero', 'Squad', 'Show.I', 'thought', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Armored', 'Adventures', 'was', 'great', 'series', 'especially', 'when', 'was', 'initially', 'reluctant', 'watch', 'yet', 'show', 'lead', 'character', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'younger', 'part', 'plot', 'Nevertheless', 'made', 'great', 'stories', 'great', 'appearances', 'other', 'Marvel', 'characters', 'including', 'Hawkeye', 'Black', 'Widow', 'Black', 'Panther', 'Dr.Doom', 'Hulk', 'yearn', 'time', 'when', 'action-oriented', 'animated', 'series', 'will', 'last', 'more', '2', 'seasons', 'again']","Iron Man: Armored Adventures, Complete Season 2"
