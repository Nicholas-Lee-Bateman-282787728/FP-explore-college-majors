1396542,A2BC9TW5GO4XJR,B004CZZZIQ,Celia DLF,"[0, 0]","I always liked this western film.  A group of civilians and soldiers are trapped by warring Apaches in a little cul-de-sac in a canyon.  The hero (Rory Calhoun) is competent and unafraid.  Everyone depends on him, even the inexperienced cavalry soldiers.  I especially liked the teenagers he rescues.  This Columbia Classics DVD-R release is not perfect but not bad.  I am glad they included the trailer.  The picture is not as sharp and clear as I remember TV showings of this film to be, but it is still very good.  I could be wrong but I think it is also edited by 2 to 3 minutes.  Otherwise I recommend this film and this release.  It may be the only release of this film ever available.",3,Apache Territory,1378857600,"09 11, 2013",2013,691,"['always', 'liked', 'western', 'film', 'group', 'civilians', 'soldiers', 'are', 'trapped', 'warring', 'Apaches', 'little', 'cul-de-sac', 'canyon', 'hero', 'Rory', 'Calhoun', 'competent', 'unafraid', 'Everyone', 'even', 'inexperienced', 'cavalry', 'soldiers', 'especially', 'liked', 'teenagers', 'Columbia', 'Classics', 'DVD-R', 'release', 'not', 'perfect', 'not', 'bad', 'am', 'glad', 'included', 'trailer', 'picture', 'not', 'sharp', 'clear', 'remember', 'TV', 'showings', 'film', 'be', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'think', 'also', 'edited', '2', '3', 'minutes', 'Otherwise', 'recommend', 'film', 'release', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'release', 'film', 'ever', 'available']",Apache Territory

1396545,A1ORZ2ZH5MIZCG,B004CZZZIQ,Kay's Husband,"[5, 5]","Taken from the Louis L'Amour 1957 novel, Last Stand At Papago Wells, this movie script is a western centered upon a small cavalry troop and a few civilians trying to hold out against odds of continual Apache attacks at a remote water hole.  This life giving water is situated with in a remote group of rocks, in the sun-blasted and forbidding desert land.  A natural ""fort"" as such, who holds this water, controls life in the surrounding area.Logan Cates is drifting to Yuma and this is the only way to get there.  As he says ""the price of vigilance is a way of life in Apache country"".The Arizona desert could easily kill a man, this Logan Cates knew well. He also knew the protection that this water hole in the desert could offer.  It was protected by rocks, a natural fort of sorts, and supplied with a few day's water.  All the travelers were headed for Yuma and Cates knew full well that the water was all that could guarantee any chance of their hope to outlast the Apache war party and live to get there. If they could only outlast the seiges from the Apaches.  And that big ""if"" rests on the weather as much as anything else.  Cates is hoping for a storm to interfere with the Apaches.Maybe the storm Logan Cates hoped for, a sand storm in the offering, could aid in their escape and survival to Yuma.Another interesting, psychological, and  somewhat formulaic western with Rory Calhoun well worth watching.",4,ALL DEPENDS ON LOGAN CATES,1353801600,"11 25, 2012",2012,1416,"['Taken', 'Louis', ""L'Amour"", '1957', 'novel', 'Last', 'Stand', 'Papago', 'Wells', 'movie', 'script', 'western', 'centered', 'small', 'cavalry', 'troop', 'few', 'civilians', 'trying', 'hold', 'out', 'odds', 'continual', 'Apache', 'attacks', 'remote', 'water', 'hole', 'life', 'giving', 'water', 'situated', 'remote', 'group', 'rocks', 'sun-blasted', 'forbidding', 'desert', 'land', 'natural', 'fort', 'such', 'who', 'water', 'life', 'surrounding', 'area.Logan', 'Cates', 'drifting', 'Yuma', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'there', 'price', 'vigilance', 'way', 'life', 'Apache', 'country', 'Arizona', 'desert', 'could', 'easily', 'kill', 'man', 'Logan', 'Cates', 'knew', 'well', 'also', 'knew', 'protection', 'water', 'hole', 'desert', 'could', 'offer', 'was', 'protected', 'rocks', 'natural', 'fort', 'sorts', 'supplied', 'few', 'day', 'water', 'travelers', 'were', 'headed', 'Yuma', 'Cates', 'knew', 'full', 'well', 'water', 'was', 'could', 'guarantee', 'chance', 'hope', 'outlast', 'Apache', 'war', 'party', 'live', 'get', 'there', 'could', 'only', 'outlast', 'seiges', 'Apaches', 'big', 'weather', 'as', 'much', 'anything', 'else', 'Cates', 'hoping', 'storm', 'interfere', 'Apaches.Maybe', 'storm', 'Logan', 'Cates', 'hoped', 'sand', 'storm', 'offering', 'could', 'aid', 'escape', 'survival', 'Yuma.Another', 'interesting', 'psychological', 'somewhat', 'formulaic', 'western', 'Rory', 'Calhoun', 'well', 'watching']",Apache Territory
