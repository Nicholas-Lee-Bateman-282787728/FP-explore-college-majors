Wilson ""Atheen""","[25, 25]","We got to discussing favorite movies at work recently, and Vicki, one of the nurses I work with in the recovery room, said she'd seen Saving Grace and had really loved it.  She gave me a short recap of the film, and I decided it was worth a couple of hours of time and bought it. Normally I'm the type of movie goer who labors ad infinitum over the implications of each character's actions, and certainly the underlying drug theme might well have brought out that tendency with a vengeance, but in viewing Saving Grace, I was so beguiled by the charm of the village and it's delightful residents that I was able to suspend criticality and just enjoy my ""visit.""The venue of the story is a colorful coastal village in England.  Though a little bleak, the surrounding country side is open and green, with wonderful vistas of the sea, and the village is a cluster of quaint, old, stone buildings along narrow, little streets.  The title character, Grace, is the lady of the local manor and presides graciously over the social activities of her neighborhood.  Her home is a gorgeous vine covered house in the midst of well kept grounds, a home she loves and which she is unknowingly about to lose due to the capricious financial habits of her philandering and recently deceased spouse.  The story turns on Grace's outrageous plans to save her home and the naivety with which she pursues them, assisted or at least abetted by an assortment of delightful neighbors including her gardener, her doctor and even her husband's former mistress.Grace is played with great skill by Brenda Blethyn.  She's pretty and perky and just at ""that age"" where a women who had been financially independent for most of her life might find it difficult to start anew.  Even as she starts on her ""life of crime""-""I'm going to be a drugs dealer!""--one can't help but cheer her on for her audacity, just as most of her neighbors come to do.  Beset by collection notices with every post, the intrusion of an assessor who arrives as her door to evaluate her house for auction, and phone calls from a persistent London creditor, Grace takes the bull by the horns and bursts-or more properly blunders--onto the drug scene.  Craig Ferguson as her Scottish gardener Matthew, is the perfect instigator, naive enough himself to be funny but opportunist enough to see their approach to saving the manor as viable.Even though my husband and I are frequently at odds with respect to our film preferences, we both enjoyed this movie.

We are both middle-aged women so we have become over time big Brenda Blethyn fans. We doubted that any American movie maker would have made this film with a middle-aged woman, Blethyn, as not only the leading character but also the lead ROMANTIC character. This film contains the ultimate dose of charm, humor and whimsy as only the British can show in their own unique fashion.  Admittedly, sometimes I &quot;get&quot; their funny movies and sometimes I don't.  This one we both &quot;got&quot; and were laughing uproariously throughout it as was our audience.  Yes, it goes a bit over the top at the end but it's a very &quot;feel good&quot; ending and this movie was a bit of a fairy tale anyway so it didn't bother us. The plot involves a newly widowed and thus impoverished Blethyn who is a top gardener in her village.  When her gardener brings her his marijuana stash for rejuvenation, they decide to grow more and sell a big crop of it to a drug dealer so as to solve her money problems. Seeing Blethyn trying to find a drug dealer in London on her own is worth the price of admission alone for outright hilarity. If the film maker had chosen heroin as the drug the movie obviously would not have worked.  However, the use of marijuana in this movie is about as &quot;serious&quot; as its use in the old Cheech and Chong movies.

Grace (Brenda Blethyn) has just discovered that her recently deceased husband has left her with an enormous debt.  While trying to manage her widowed life and her debt, she comes up with a scheme to make big money - with the help of her gardener Matthew (Craig Ferguson).

The fun comes in droves with the numerous facets of being virgin marijuana dealers; even the simple task of lighting the greenhouse to help grow the plants becomes a riotous joke... the intense light glows so bright, it can be seen for miles. Then there's the matter of finding drug dealers to buy and sell their product... Blethyn is superbly suited for the role of the innocent but not entirely naive widow trying to relate to street thugs and drug dealers. The laughs continue as the stash of her marijuana is discovered and has to be burned... inevitably getting everyone high, including the police.

I watched this in 2 sittings, and the first few minutes I found it to be a rather well done mystery/drama where the main character of Grace woke up one morning to find her husband dead, and the estate is in a shambles as her late husband didn't share with her what was going on, so while some might find this creative I found it to be rather stupid. I would have rather seen it kind of like a ""Mrs. Wiggs of The Cabbage Patch"" where her friends and neighbors secretly take care of her needs to get her back on her feet, but what do I get? she begins to grow marijuana in her greenhouse to sell to keep her house.

For Craig Ferguson fans, it's a must -own. Tcheky Karyo fans will chortle as he pops up yet again where least anticipated.Newly widowed Grace (pertly played by Brenda Blethyn) finds her dissolute husband has left her nothing but debt; creditors and re-possessors now besiege her lovely Cornish seaside home. As she seeks solace in tending her greenhouse orchids, she ponders how to get out of the financial quagmire.  For distraction she charitably tends to her feckless caretaker (Craig Ferguson)'s ailing personal-use cannabis plot, and a joint venture blooms.As Grace and Matthew modify the greenhouse, cultivate the crop, and go to market, hilarity, as they say, ensues. The villagers - all characters we wish were in our local pub - are perfection as they feign ignorance of the entire enterprise, while quietly lending unseen support to their beloved neighbor. No one is as he or she initially seems, and the various `reveals' in the subplots are charming and delightful. There is much 70's style stoner humor, but with an updated, wonderful, and uniquely British twist.Obligatory ""locals inadvertently get stoned"" sequences are not only original in their construction but, somehow, innocent and sweet. The ladies and the corn flakes scene is certainly one of the finest pieces of physical comedy ever put on film. And as the story progresses, it evolves from a tale of potentially puerile marijuana mishaps to, instead, one of the power of love and redemption as Grace and Matthew each find their salvation in the unfolding of a future neither of them foresaw.

Grace Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn) is widowed by her husband when he takes a flying leap out of an airplane without a parachute.  Upon putting their affairs in order, she discovers that he spent all their money and mortgaged the estate leaving her penniless and steeply in debt.  In a last ditch effort to save the estate, she hits upon the idea of using her hothouse and her considerable skills with plants to grow and sell high quality marijuana.  Thus, the formerly wealthy widow collaborates with her gardener to grow and process the weed and attempt to bring it to market.  The results are often hilarious, especially her negotiations with the drug kingpin and the reactions of the local residents.The film is well directed and written with numerous funny situations throughout.  Director Nigel Cole keeps the pace brisk and works well with the actors to produce a good deal of physical comedy laced with comical reaction scenes by various characters.  He also treats us to some terrific locations that show off the wonderful English countryside.  The acting is excellent, especially by Brenda Blethyn, who is quite humorous as the fish out of water determined to make her way in the drug culture.  She has a quality that makes her equally believable as a proper English aristocrat and a common conniver.  Craig Ferguson is also good as her partner in crime, a hapless fellow whose harebrained ideas are always getting him into trouble.The story is not very original, the film having thematic similarities to numerous British comedies of the recent past (""Waking Ned Devine"", ""The Full Monty""), however one can do worse than imitate the success of these films.

Naturally if you mix a quaint Cornish village - largely populated by retired genteel ladies - with a liberal dose of marijuana, a certain amount of silliness will ensue.  However, the last seven minutes of the film descend into the totally ludicrous and is not even redeemed by being particularly funny.  It is a real shame, because this comedy has the potential to be every bit as good as 1998's Waking Ned Devine, which also portrayed a picturesque small village and its oddball inhabitants trying to extract themselves from a tricky situation.The protagonist of Saving Grace is middle-aged, recently widowed Grace Trevethyn, whose husband's legacy of bad debts has forced her into an unconventional way of earning money.  Helped by her gardener, Matthew, she turns her horticultural expertise to the lucrative cultivation of marijuana.  Unfortunately, this leads her into confrontation with the local police, her husband's creditors and a French drug baron. . . . . . . . . . whom all turn up at her greenhouse simultaneously.  The relationship and rapport between Grace and Matthew is well-portrayed, and Brenda Blethyn gets the viewer emotionally involved with her likeable character - you can really feel what she is going through.The casting of the minor roles is excellent, even if some of them are rather outlandishly eccentric.  However, the transformation of Jacques the drug lord into Grace's romantic interest is highly implausible and does not fit the tone of the movie at all.  And surely hydroponics is not such a revolution in the world of cannabis growing?  Sadly the film swaps gentle humour for slapstick and ends up being as fake as the marijuana plants.",2,&quot;Have you tried plant food?&quot;,1076803200,"02 15, 2004",2004,1800,"['Saving', 'Grace', 'surely', 'one', 'leading', 'contenders', ""'How"", 'Ruin', 'Adequate', 'Film', 'Final', 'Few', 'Minutes', 'award', 'Naturally', 'mix', 'quaint', 'Cornish', 'village', 'largely', 'populated', 'retired', 'genteel', 'ladies', 'liberal', 'dose', 'marijuana', 'certain', 'amount', 'silliness', 'will', 'ensue', 'However', 'last', 'seven', 'minutes', 'film', 'descend', 'totally', 'ludicrous', 'not', 'even', 'redeemed', 'being', 'particularly', 'funny', 'real', 'shame', 'comedy', 'potential', 'be', 'bit', 'as', 'good', '1998', 'Waking', 'Ned', 'Devine', 'also', 'portrayed', 'picturesque', 'small', 'village', 'oddball', 'inhabitants', 'trying', 'extract', 'tricky', 'situation.The', 'protagonist', 'Saving', 'Grace', 'middle-aged', 'recently', 'widowed', 'Grace', 'Trevethyn', 'husband', 'legacy', 'bad', 'debts', 'forced', 'unconventional', 'way', 'earning', 'money', 'Helped', 'gardener', 'Matthew', 'horticultural', 'expertise', 'lucrative', 'cultivation', 'marijuana', 'Unfortunately', 'confrontation', 'local', 'police', 'husband', 'creditors', 'French', 'drug', 'baron', 'whom', 'turn', 'up', 'greenhouse', 'simultaneously', 'relationship', 'rapport', 'Grace', 'Matthew', 'well-portrayed', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'viewer', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'likeable', 'character', 'can', 'really', 'feel', 'what', 'going', 'through.The', 'casting', 'minor', 'roles', 'excellent', 'even', 'are', 'rather', 'outlandishly', 'eccentric', 'However', 'transformation', 'Jacques', 'drug', 'lord', 'Grace', 'romantic', 'interest', 'highly', 'implausible', 'not', 'fit', 'tone', 'movie', 'surely', 'hydroponics', 'not', 'such', 'revolution', 'world', 'cannabis', 'growing', 'Sadly', 'film', 'swaps', 'gentle', 'humour', 'slapstick', 'up', 'being', 'as', 'fake', 'marijuana', 'plants']",Saving Grace

529413,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXMY,Matthew Horner,"[2, 3]","Craig Ferguson, one of the stars and co-writers of Saving Grace, recently made some interesting comments about critics and comedies. He claimed that the most scathing reviews were reserved for comedies. His feeling was that, when a reviewer found a comedy to be particularly unfunny, he or she tended to write an opinion which implied that those who did find it amusing were intellectually inferior to the writer. I think his point is well taken, although his comments may have been directed as much towards the TV series The Drew Carey Show, on which he is a regular, as they were to Saving Grace. Whatever the case, the movie, while not breaking new ground, is a winner.Grace Trevethyn's [Brenda Blethyn] troubles are only just beginning when her husband falls to his death. It seems he has left her high and dry, with no money and a huge mortgage on their house. Grace has never paid attention to the business side of life, preferring to devote her time to the cultivating of orchids in her greenhouse. She has no idea what to do about her situation. It is her gardener, Matthew [Craig Ferguson], who inadvertently shows her a possible solution to her plight. He asks her to figure out what's wrong with some plants he is growing secretly behind the local vicar's house. She quickly recognized them as marijuana, but, seeing herself as a sort of plant doctor, she has Matthew bring them to her greenhouse, where they make a miraculous recovery. After Matthew tells her the street value of the pot, Grace decides they can make enough money for her to save her home. Naturally, such a plan is full of pitfalls.This is a typically British comedy. The setting is a quaint village in Cornwall. It's populated by delightful eccentrics who usually turn a blind eye to certain goings on that might just be a tad illegal. Cornwall, by the way, has a checkered past, having in the past been the smuggling capital of the British Isles. Looking the other way is a tradition there.Brenda Blethyn is a joy as Grace. Her matronly appearance is counterbalanced by a quick wit and a devilish glint in her eyes. Hers is a character many of us can relate to. Grace lives a peaceful, normal life, except when her back is against the wall. Then she does whatever must be done. Craig Ferguson plays Matthew as a man who is almost, but not quite, ready to become a responsible adult. His is another character many can feel at home with. Also notable are Jamie Foreman as Matthew's down to earth girlfriend, and Tceky Karyo as Jacques, the real drug dealer Grace finds in London.Saving Grace is actually a rather old-fashioned movie, which is the source of much of its charm. After all, the very public debate over marijuana usage has been going on and on and on for over thirty years now. The subject matter can hardly be considered shocking.",4,How to Save Your Home,1016409600,"03 18, 2002",2002,2822,"['Craig', 'Ferguson', 'one', 'stars', 'co-writers', 'Saving', 'Grace', 'recently', 'made', 'interesting', 'comments', 'critics', 'comedies', 'claimed', 'most', 'scathing', 'reviews', 'were', 'reserved', 'comedies', 'feeling', 'was', 'when', 'reviewer', 'found', 'comedy', 'be', 'particularly', 'unfunny', 'tended', 'write', 'opinion', 'implied', 'who', 'did', 'find', 'amusing', 'were', 'intellectually', 'inferior', 'writer', 'think', 'point', 'well', 'taken', 'comments', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'directed', 'much', 'TV', 'series', 'Drew', 'Carey', 'Show', 'regular', 'were', 'Saving', 'Grace', 'Whatever', 'case', 'movie', 'not', 'breaking', 'new', 'ground', 'winner.Grace', 'Trevethyn', '[', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', ']', 'troubles', 'are', 'only', 'just', 'beginning', 'when', 'husband', 'death', 'left', 'high', 'dry', 'money', 'huge', 'mortgage', 'house', 'Grace', 'never', 'paid', 'attention', 'business', 'side', 'life', 'preferring', 'devote', 'time', 'cultivating', 'orchids', 'greenhouse', 'idea', 'what', 'do', 'situation', 'gardener', 'Matthew', '[', 'Craig', 'Ferguson', ']', 'who', 'inadvertently', 'possible', 'solution', 'plight', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'wrong', 'plants', 'growing', 'secretly', 'local', 'vicar', 'house', 'quickly', 'recognized', 'marijuana', 'seeing', 'sort', 'plant', 'doctor', 'Matthew', 'bring', 'greenhouse', 'where', 'make', 'miraculous', 'recovery', 'Matthew', 'street', 'value', 'pot', 'Grace', 'can', 'make', 'enough', 'money', 'save', 'home', 'Naturally', 'plan', 'full', 'pitfalls.This', 'typically', 'British', 'comedy', 'setting', 'quaint', 'village', 'Cornwall', 'populated', 'delightful', 'eccentrics', 'who', 'usually', 'turn', 'blind', 'eye', 'certain', 'goings', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'tad', 'illegal', 'Cornwall', 'way', 'checkered', 'past', 'having', 'past', 'been', 'smuggling', 'capital', 'British', 'Isles', 'Looking', 'other', 'way', 'tradition', 'there.Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'joy', 'Grace', 'matronly', 'appearance', 'counterbalanced', 'quick', 'wit', 'devilish', 'glint', 'eyes', 'Hers', 'character', 'many', 'can', 'relate', 'Grace', 'peaceful', 'normal', 'life', 'when', 'back', 'wall', 'Then', 'must', 'be', 'done', 'Craig', 'Ferguson', 'Matthew', 'man', 'who', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'ready', 'become', 'responsible', 'adult', 'character', 'many', 'can', 'feel', 'home', 'Also', 'notable', 'are', 'Jamie', 'Foreman', 'Matthew', 'down', 'earth', 'girlfriend', 'Tceky', 'Karyo', 'Jacques', 'real', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Grace', 'London.Saving', 'Grace', 'actually', 'rather', 'old-fashioned', 'movie', 'source', 'much', 'charm', 'very', 'public', 'debate', 'marijuana', 'usage', 'been', 'going', 'thirty', 'years', 'now', 'subject', 'matter', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'considered', 'shocking']",Saving Grace

Grace's (Brenda Blethyn) husband has just died in an improbable manner and left her with some improbable problems, viz. a very large house with a very large mortgage and a very beautiful mistress. The very proper Grace has always tended to the house and in particular is known as a champion gardener. She has no idea what to do as she is slowly advised of the depth of her financial problems. But like a proper Brit she doesn't despair and before long her Scottish handyman turns to her for help in improving his meager home-use marijuana crop, and the plot is set.Grace takes a plant cutting home and soon has it looking green and bountifully budful. She inquires about the price one could get for such a plant and when she hears the answer it seems like gardening could, indeed, be her salvation. You can almost see the gears working in this wonderful actress' head! From initial dawning we go to full scale production while dodging the local constable, the bank owner, the vicar and yet the whole town knows what's going on. Then we move into the distribution phase complete with drug dealers in London, chase scenes and farce. And, should I say, amid much laughter. If you don't laugh at this movie, you best check your pulse. There is a romantic side plot having to do with the handyman's fisherman girlfriend who is pregnant as well as the mystery of the hidden life of the dead husband.The movie was filmed in the Cornwall area and has some beautiful shots of that part of the world as the land cavorts with the sea. The acting is flawless and rendered with both restraint and energy at the appropriate time. You probably wouldn't need language to ""get"" this movie as much of the humor is physical. However, the actors do all speak English, that language that keeps us separated, and after you get your American ear tuned in you can understand the dialogue without difficulty. There is, of course, a bit of a moral dilemma here, what they are doing is after-all against the law, but that tension is settled in a satisfactory manner leading to an acceptable end just when you though movies could no longer end acceptably.",5,"If you don&#65533;t laugh at this movie, you best check your pulse",979084800,"01 10, 2001",2001,2277,"['Saving', 'Grace', 'old', 'fashioned', 'British', 'romp', 'tradition', 'Faulty', 'Towers', 'other', 'great', 'British', 'TV', 'imported', 'years', 'PBS', 'Grace', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'husband', 'just', 'died', 'improbable', 'manner', 'left', 'improbable', 'problems', 'viz', 'very', 'large', 'house', 'very', 'large', 'mortgage', 'very', 'beautiful', 'mistress', 'very', 'proper', 'Grace', 'always', 'tended', 'house', 'particular', 'known', 'champion', 'gardener', 'idea', 'what', 'do', 'slowly', 'advised', 'depth', 'financial', 'problems', 'proper', 'Brit', ""n't"", 'despair', 'long', 'Scottish', 'handyman', 'help', 'improving', 'meager', 'home-use', 'marijuana', 'crop', 'plot', 'set.Grace', 'plant', 'cutting', 'home', 'soon', 'looking', 'green', 'bountifully', 'budful', 'price', 'one', 'could', 'get', 'such', 'plant', 'when', 'answer', 'gardening', 'could', 'indeed', 'be', 'salvation', 'can', 'almost', 'see', 'gears', 'working', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'head', 'initial', 'dawning', 'go', 'full', 'scale', 'production', 'dodging', 'local', 'constable', 'bank', 'owner', 'vicar', 'yet', 'whole', 'town', 'what', 'going', 'Then', 'move', 'distribution', 'phase', 'complete', 'drug', 'dealers', 'London', 'chase', 'scenes', 'farce', 'should', 'say', 'much', 'laughter', 'do', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'movie', 'best', 'check', 'pulse', 'romantic', 'side', 'plot', 'having', 'do', 'handyman', 'fisherman', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'pregnant', 'as', 'well', 'mystery', 'hidden', 'life', 'dead', 'husband.The', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'Cornwall', 'area', 'beautiful', 'shots', 'part', 'world', 'land', 'cavorts', 'sea', 'acting', 'flawless', 'rendered', 'restraint', 'energy', 'appropriate', 'time', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'need', 'language', 'get', 'movie', 'much', 'humor', 'physical', 'However', 'actors', 'do', 'speak', 'English', 'language', 'separated', 'get', 'American', 'ear', 'tuned', 'can', 'understand', 'dialogue', 'difficulty', 'course', 'bit', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'here', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'after-all', 'law', 'tension', 'settled', 'satisfactory', 'manner', 'leading', 'acceptable', 'end', 'just', 'when', 'movies', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'end', 'acceptably']",Saving Grace

The English like their humour either subtle, or over-the-top farcical, Americans prefer smutty or slapstick (hence the transatlantic popularity of Benny Hill & Fawlty Towers). ""Saving Grace"" has none of the above. Such humour as there is is purely situational, and consists largely of ordinary people doing completely ridiculous things due to the nature of Grace's cash crop. This is the kind of unfunny humour I associate with films from Down Under, where inane offerings like ""The Castle"" have huge success The plot thesis is thin, and its development is non-existent. The main characters are simply not credible, despite superb acting from just about everyone in the cast.
