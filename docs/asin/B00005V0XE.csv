It was supposed to make you laugh, but it makes you laugh because it's a dumb joke.Otherwise, most of the humor that is in it works really well, such as the Ice Breakers getting Viagra or how the Chiefs or ""Super Chiefs"" ended up with their new jobs.What really takes the subtstance out of this movie though is that they do not cover the breaching of contracts as if that's not important.  Rather than making something come of it, they just suddenly end the movie.  Granted, they did not want to extend the movie because there was so much humor to fill up almost two hours, and the majority of the audience for this movie won't be looking for serious matters.

Its a straight to video with Steven Baldwin get the drift.But now with that said let me give the basic describtion of the movie. It starts with the Chiefs playing agains Albany, of course there losing and the announcer say's the Chiefs haven't won a game in over 2 years. Then after the game, Coach (Baldwin) goes up to the owner of the team and talks to him, and he announces he has sold the team to a family corporation (Gary Busey), they later find out there having a name change (Super Chiefs) and being relocated to Omaha. Even to the players dismay, they are soon bought on the fact they will get a pay raise, in fact they will double there salary. At the press conference, Busey announces the Omaha Icebreakers (Globetrotters of the hockey world), and the Super Cheifs under new coach (some girl) will be there opponents. Its reveled the Super Chiefs will play 24 scripted games, of course they will lose, and 8 regular games.Also, there will be no FIGHTING!CURSING!TRIPPING!HIGHSTICKING! OR ANY VIOLENCE! Soon after, Baldwin finds out the real games wont happen. But even after learning his new ""girlfriend"" the new coach is only in this so she can show her real coaching skills and try to land a NHL job, he still takes Buseys money over friends.I wont tell anymore of the story, but it really gets slow in the middle of this film, and as all you Hanson fans see they are not a big part of the movie. Even though they are part of the funniest in which they are given new jerseys and get into a argument over there number, when each jersey has Hanson on the back. Of course, Baldwin soon comes to the rescue after he switches there jersey between themselves. The Hanson are in the first 20-25 mintues of the film, with a sceen here and there..then disapear for the next hour of so as they are booted off the team by the Icebreakers ""coach"", a former broadway dancer and director ...They than appear though for the last 10 mintues of the film and the last game, even though they dont play much in the last game. Its basically Baldwin and his ""NHL Prospect"" Miller.If this film was any other film but a Slap Shot production it would get a 2, but in honor of Slap Shot 1 it will get a extra star. Pretty good start, very very very slow Middle, and predictable and not so interesting ending.

Now that might explain why this went straight to DVD but I am glad it did . I wanted to see the Hanson Brothers again . Clearly this is NOT  Slap Shot with Paul Newman , I knew that going in . But there are enough moments and JUST enough story to enjoy watching this . Getting to see the 3 Hanson brothers again was the reason I watched this . They don't disappoint as that was a treat for me . Clearly, I would of loved a movie called THE HANSON BROTHERS GREATEST HITS but this will have to do. I enjoyed it for what it was. If you go into this expecting Slap Shot with Newman you will be disappointed. But if you like Hockey, a little story and some Hanson Brother humor this is pretty good. I am not Siskel or Ebert but I am glad I watched it .

But if you're a Real Hockey fan, you're gonna love this movie!  Put on your foil and be prepared to laugh till you cry. Not for the squeamish or faint of heart, this is a rousing, carousing, cursing and knuckle busting Real Man's hockey movie.  It does get a little soft in the middle, but the ending pays for all.  It's great to see the Hanson brothers again, just like Gordie Howe... GORDIE! (Get that elbow in the air!) Lots of fun and excitement.  Best of all the Hansons come out on top... WAY on top.

Anything with the Hanson brothers is worth the watch.  I had the good fortune to meet two of the three a few years ago and they are just as funny in person.  For me.....hockey humor never gets old and this movie is a good example of hockey humor with a little humanity mixed in.  A good watch at a good price.  I did make the mistake of getting it in VHS, but...that's okay.
