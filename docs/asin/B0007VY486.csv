891895,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B0007VY486,calvinnme,"[33, 35]","This collection is a reissue of six of the NFL's popular ""Follies"" films consisting of bloopers, the antics of both players and fans, and plays that have gone so very wrong dating back to 1959, as far as I can tell from watching the earliest video. There's a lot of entertainment per dollar on this DVD set, and I consider it a worthy purchase. Here's what you get:Disc 1The Football Follies (1968) 20 minutes.A documentary-style film typical of 1960's vintage NFL films. What seems odd is that nobody ever identifies the players involved.  They were just considered the workhorses of the league back then, not supermen with the rock star status they enjoy today.The Son of Football Follies (1976) 23 minutesA clip show with John Facenda narrating using his trademark NFL films broadcast voice and Mel Blanc narrating using the voices of Yosemite Sam, Bugs Bunny, and the other characters for which he is famous.NFL Follies Go Hollywood (1983) 25 minutesMade immediately after VCRs became so popular, this entry has a documentary structure. It contains trailers, a comedy short entitled ""Keystone Korterbacks"", and fake newsreels just like the movies of yesteryear.Disc 2NFL's 100 Greatest Follies (1994) 45 minutesStarting with this film, the Follies get much longer, and there is much overlap with the first three. The big difference is this time the players involved are named. We have now entered the age of the football player as rock star.Talkin' Follies (1997) 45 minutesConsists of voiceovers for the dialogue between players and coaches, coaches and officials, even some good shots of what a couple of owners could be saying. Thanks to wireless devices, we also have a good amount of actual on-field dialogue. Its style appears to be capitalizing on the popularity of Mystery Science 3000.21st Century Follies (2000) 45 minutesThe sixth and final Follies feature included is oddly named since the 21st century had just started. Like the 1997 film, there are more actual conversations due to wireless helmet devices, plus some interesting end-zone dances, out-takes from actual NFL Films interviews, a receiver running into a kicking net, and other such antics. The wireless devices are a double-edged sword here: You have a lot of humorous on-field spontaneity, but there is also quite a bit of bad language.There are no extras included. This is a great treat for any football fan, especially during this long off-season when we suffer through the rest of the NBA season, the beginning of baseball season, and wait for that first pre-season game. Highly recommended.",5,A good collection of bloopers from the past 40 years,1170028800,"01 29, 2007",2007,2575,"['collection', 'reissue', 'six', 'NFL', 'popular', 'Follies', 'films', 'consisting', 'bloopers', 'antics', 'players', 'fans', 'plays', 'have', 'gone', 'so', 'very', 'wrong', 'dating', 'back', '1959', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'watching', 'earliest', 'video', 'lot', 'entertainment', 'dollar', 'DVD', 'set', 'consider', 'worthy', 'purchase', 'Here', 'what', 'get', 'Disc', '1The', 'Football', 'Follies', '1968', '20', 'minutes.A', 'documentary-style', 'film', 'typical', '1960', 'vintage', 'NFL', 'films', 'What', 'odd', 'nobody', 'ever', 'players', 'involved', 'were', 'just', 'considered', 'workhorses', 'league', 'back', 'then', 'not', 'supermen', 'rock', 'star', 'status', 'enjoy', 'today.The', 'Son', 'Football', 'Follies', '1976', '23', 'minutesA', 'clip', 'show', 'John', 'Facenda', 'narrating', 'using', 'trademark', 'NFL', 'films', 'broadcast', 'voice', 'Mel', 'Blanc', 'narrating', 'using', 'voices', 'Yosemite', 'Sam', 'Bugs', 'Bunny', 'other', 'characters', 'famous.NFL', 'Follies', 'Go', 'Hollywood', '1983', '25', 'minutesMade', 'immediately', 'VCRs', 'became', 'so', 'popular', 'entry', 'documentary', 'structure', 'trailers', 'comedy', 'short', 'entitled', 'Keystone', 'Korterbacks', 'fake', 'newsreels', 'just', 'movies', '2NFL', '100', 'Greatest', 'Follies', '1994', '45', 'minutesStarting', 'film', 'Follies', 'get', 'much', 'longer', 'much', 'first', 'three', 'big', 'difference', 'time', 'players', 'involved', 'are', 'named', 'have', 'now', 'entered', 'age', 'football', 'player', 'rock', 'star.Talkin', 'Follies', '1997', '45', 'minutesConsists', 'voiceovers', 'dialogue', 'players', 'coaches', 'coaches', 'officials', 'even', 'good', 'shots', 'what', 'couple', 'owners', 'could', 'be', 'saying', 'Thanks', 'wireless', 'devices', 'also', 'have', 'good', 'amount', 'actual', 'on-field', 'dialogue', 'style', 'be', 'capitalizing', 'popularity', 'Mystery', 'Science', '3000.21st', 'Century', 'Follies', '2000', '45', 'minutesThe', 'sixth', 'final', 'Follies', 'feature', 'included', 'oddly', 'named', '21st', 'century', 'had', 'just', 'started', '1997', 'film', 'are', 'more', 'actual', 'conversations', 'due', 'wireless', 'helmet', 'devices', 'interesting', 'end-zone', 'dances', 'out-takes', 'actual', 'NFL', 'Films', 'interviews', 'receiver', 'running', 'kicking', 'net', 'other', 'such', 'antics', 'wireless', 'devices', 'are', 'double-edged', 'sword', 'here', 'have', 'lot', 'humorous', 'on-field', 'spontaneity', 'also', 'quite', 'bit', 'bad', 'are', 'extras', 'included', 'great', 'treat', 'football', 'fan', 'especially', 'long', 'off-season', 'when', 'suffer', 'rest', 'NBA', 'season', 'beginning', 'baseball', 'season', 'wait', 'first', 'pre-season', 'game', 'Highly', 'recommended']",NFL Greatest Follies Complete Collection

891898,A2R9NG5SF8MWQT,B0007VY486,Hephzibah,"[3, 3]","I have mixed feelings about this set.  The visuals of the follies, etc., are great:  funny, enjoyable, and even a few ""wows"".  The ""choreography"" to classic music such as excerpts of the Nutcracker Suite are really well done.However, I found the ""Talkin' Follies"" (voice-overs that put words in people's mouths other than what they truly said) so annoying that I quit watching it. Also, I do not find listening to ""Bugs Bunny"" et al either funny or helpful; to me such things are distracting and actually lessen the humor. Since that film also has one of the great ""ballet"" segments, I'm going to hit the mute button until I reach the ""ballet"" when I watch it in the future.  I also found the commentary on the first film lessened the humor of the activities caught on film, and will mute it in the future until I reach its ""ballet"" segment.The best of the films, in my opinion, is the ""100 Greatest Follies"".  All are numbered, though only the top 10 are in sequence. The commentary is better and doesn't distract or detract from the follies themselves. As a result, the humor of what I was watching actually got me laughing because there wasn't an undercurrent of frustration caused by the narrators. And the follies chosen are truly funny.I, as others reviewing here, was puzzled by the title of the last film, because it is not follies that occurred in the 21st century (so a misnomer, in my opinion), but a film released in the 21st century.I really enjoy football, and really enjoy classic football (say, pre-90's, roughly), so the visual portion is great and highly recommended.  The narration and ""Talkin' Follies"" aspects are what lowered my rating to 3 stars.",3,Mixed feelings,1315612800,"09 10, 2011",2011,1669,"['have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'set', 'visuals', 'follies', 'etc.', 'are', 'great', 'funny', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'few', 'wows', 'choreography', 'classic', 'music', 'such', 'excerpts', 'Nutcracker', 'Suite', 'are', 'really', 'well', 'done.However', 'found', 'Talkin', 'Follies', 'voice-overs', 'put', 'words', 'people', 'mouths', 'other', 'what', 'truly', 'said', 'so', 'annoying', 'quit', 'watching', 'Also', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'listening', 'Bugs', 'Bunny', 'et', 'al', 'funny', 'helpful', 'such', 'things', 'are', 'distracting', 'actually', 'lessen', 'humor', 'film', 'also', 'one', 'great', 'ballet', 'segments', ""'m"", 'going', 'hit', 'mute', 'button', 'reach', 'ballet', 'when', 'watch', 'future', 'also', 'found', 'commentary', 'first', 'film', 'lessened', 'humor', 'activities', 'caught', 'film', 'will', 'mute', 'future', 'reach', 'ballet', 'segment.The', 'best', 'films', 'opinion', '100', 'Greatest', 'Follies', 'are', 'numbered', 'only', 'top', '10', 'are', 'sequence', 'commentary', 'better', ""n't"", 'distract', 'detract', 'follies', 'result', 'humor', 'what', 'was', 'watching', 'actually', 'got', 'laughing', 'was', ""n't"", 'undercurrent', 'frustration', 'caused', 'narrators', 'follies', 'chosen', 'are', 'truly', 'funny.I', 'others', 'reviewing', 'here', 'was', 'puzzled', 'title', 'last', 'film', 'not', 'follies', 'occurred', '21st', 'century', 'misnomer', 'opinion', 'film', 'released', '21st', 'century.I', 'really', 'enjoy', 'football', 'really', 'enjoy', 'classic', 'football', 'say', 'pre-90', 'roughly', 'visual', 'portion', 'great', 'highly', 'recommended', 'narration', 'Talkin', 'Follies', 'aspects', 'are', 'what', 'lowered', 'rating', '3', 'stars']",NFL Greatest Follies Complete Collection
