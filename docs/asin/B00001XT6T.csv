I now have 15 months old twins and have just introduced them to the Wiggles.This is a great first/starter Wiggles DVD for children under 18 months. The songs and actions that go with them are the simplest of all the Wiggles DVD's. My kids can easily keep up with each number and all throughout the day, use the hand motions from the songs even when they aren't watching the DVD. The puppets towards the latter part of the DVD did frighten the boys at first, but after several plays and peeking over my shoulder until they became comfortable, now they love to &#34;Point their Finger & do the Twist&#34;. We have been playing this DVD nightly as part of their bedtime routine for the last 2 months. Amazingly, husband and I are not tired yet of the songs. We actually sing with the Wiggles when watching it with the boys. We picked this DVD first because of the past reviews and they are pretty accurate that this is a fantastic beginner Wiggles DVD. I also liked the fact that this DVD does not have any political undertones in it like other children's DVD's I have seen. Pure enjoyment for my kids and I.The production quality of the sets, dances, and acting are definitely cheesy, and the editing is really off, but kids are not going to notice it at all. In fact, we bought 3 more Wiggles DVD's where the Wiggles upgraded their special effects, backgrounds, and song complexities, yet by far, Yummy, Yummy is their favorite one. &#34;Wiggle Time&#34; would have to be their second favorite as it still sticks to a pretty easy formula of simplicity, color, and actions.",5,Fantastic first Wiggles DVD for 15-18 month olds,1395360000,"03 21, 2014",2014,1751,"['used', 'babysit', '3', 'year', 'old', 'nephew', 'early', '2000', 'Wiggles', 'were', 'TV', 'regularly', 'then', 'remembered', 'nephew', 'sitting', 'still', 'long', 'enough', 'watch', 'full', 'episode', 'now', 'have', '15', 'months', 'old', 'twins', 'have', 'just', 'introduced', 'Wiggles.This', 'great', 'first/starter', 'Wiggles', 'DVD', 'children', '18', 'months', 'songs', 'actions', 'go', 'are', 'simplest', 'Wiggles', 'DVD', 'kids', 'can', 'easily', 'keep', 'up', 'number', 'day', 'use', 'hand', 'motions', 'songs', 'even', 'when', 'are', ""n't"", 'watching', 'DVD', 'puppets', 'towards', 'latter', 'part', 'DVD', 'did', 'frighten', 'boys', 'first', 'several', 'plays', 'peeking', 'shoulder', 'became', 'comfortable', 'now', 'love', '34', 'Point', 'Finger', 'do', 'Twist', '34', 'have', 'been', 'playing', 'DVD', 'nightly', 'part', 'bedtime', 'routine', 'last', '2', 'months', 'Amazingly', 'husband', 'are', 'not', 'tired', 'yet', 'songs', 'actually', 'sing', 'Wiggles', 'when', 'watching', 'boys', 'picked', 'DVD', 'first', 'past', 'reviews', 'are', 'pretty', 'accurate', 'fantastic', 'beginner', 'Wiggles', 'DVD', 'also', 'liked', 'fact', 'DVD', 'not', 'have', 'political', 'undertones', 'other', 'children', 'DVD', 'have', 'seen', 'Pure', 'enjoyment', 'kids', 'I.The', 'production', 'quality', 'sets', 'dances', 'acting', 'are', 'definitely', 'cheesy', 'editing', 'really', 'off', 'kids', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'notice', 'fact', 'bought', '3', 'more', 'Wiggles', 'DVD', 'where', 'Wiggles', 'upgraded', 'special', 'effects', 'backgrounds', 'song', 'complexities', 'yet', 'far', 'Yummy', 'Yummy', 'favorite', 'one', '34', 'Wiggle', 'Time', '34', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'second', 'favorite', 'still', 'pretty', 'easy', 'formula', 'simplicity', 'color', 'actions']",N/A

So, I bought the Yummy Yummy video, and watched it with my daughter. Sher is 2, and I have not seen a child get so into a video.  She dances around and can even do some of the dances!  I have never seen her do this before to anything else.  As an early childhood educator, The Wiggles are a great asset for teachers and a great way for children to learn and have fun at the same time. First of all, each song is catchy, complete with an easy dance routine to go with it.  These Aussies take old songs as well as original songs that they wrote and put a new, interesting spin on it, complete with dinosaurs, pirates and dogs that dance around as well. Most of the songs do teach about something, whether it be about food, animals, numbers, or professions.  I use these videos and music when I'm working with students and they love it. The best part, is that they get exercise and not even realize it, because they are enjoying themselves so much. Although as a parent you may seem apprehensive about them at first, give them a chance.  They do grow on you, and you will see that your child will actually learn something while having fun at the same time!",5,As A Parent And Teacher The Wiggles Are AWESOME!,1023926400,"06 13, 2002",2002,1311,"['When', 'first', 'viewed', 'Wiggles', 'little', 'segments', 'daily', 'lineup', 'Playhouse', 'Disney', 'thought', 'were', 'so', 'annoying', 'daughter', 'loved', 'So', 'bought', 'Yummy', 'Yummy', 'video', 'watched', 'daughter', 'Sher', '2', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'child', 'get', 'so', 'video', 'around', 'can', 'even', 'do', 'dances', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'do', 'anything', 'else', 'early', 'childhood', 'educator', 'Wiggles', 'are', 'great', 'asset', 'teachers', 'great', 'way', 'children', 'learn', 'have', 'fun', 'same', 'time', 'First', 'all', 'song', 'catchy', 'complete', 'easy', 'dance', 'routine', 'go', 'Aussies', 'take', 'old', 'songs', 'as', 'well', 'original', 'songs', 'wrote', 'put', 'new', 'interesting', 'spin', 'complete', 'dinosaurs', 'pirates', 'dogs', 'dance', 'around', 'as', 'well', 'Most', 'songs', 'do', 'teach', 'something', 'be', 'food', 'animals', 'numbers', 'professions', 'use', 'videos', 'music', 'when', ""'m"", 'working', 'students', 'love', 'best', 'part', 'get', 'exercise', 'not', 'even', 'realize', 'are', 'enjoying', 'so', 'much', 'parent', 'may', 'seem', 'apprehensive', 'first', 'give', 'chance', 'do', 'grow', 'will', 'see', 'child', 'will', 'actually', 'learn', 'something', 'having', 'fun', 'same', 'time']",N/A
512334,AE5FSM8F6LD89,B00001XT6T,Spiny Norman,"[7, 7]","My wife and I first encountered The Wiggles in a short ad before a Barney video. They performed one song - &quot;The Monkey Dance&quot; - with a lot of kids dancing in front. It first attracted our interest because our nearly three-year-old daughter would leap to her feet and dance along, a marked contrast to her passive viewing of most other videos. We noticed that the song was pretty good too. My wife later saw the video in a store and bought it, and we are very glad she did. The songs are well done, catchy, varied, and singable. You WILL find the songs stuck in your head all day, but they are good enough so you shouldn't mind too much. The lead singer has a very nice voice and a friendly, warm, gentle charisma about him. The other three &quot;Wiggles&quot; and their supporting cast are good too. The dances have simple moves that appear to be inspired by aerobics, easy for kids to imitate.  Almost all the speaking is done directly into the camera, which really helps draw kids in and keep their attention. There is not much &quot;educational&quot; content as in some other children's videos, the songs are more-or-less nonsense, but the exercise factor more than compensates - our daughter stays on her feet for most of the show.A few warnings: - The first couple of times we watched it my wife and I were not enthusiastic. We could tell our daughter loved it, but we couldn't believe four grown men would do this stuff. (Of course, kids love to see grown-ups doing silly things.) But the more we watched it the more we appreciated it, until now we really enjoy watching it with her.- Two of the songs are done with puppets instead of the live performers. The puppets are somwhat macabre, with huge staring eyes. The audio is sped up for these songs to give an &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot; sound. One of the songs is done in front of a psychedelic background of colored lights. The overall effect is weird. Our daugter doesn't like the puppets much, one of the songs she just tolerates, the other she usually makes me fast forward through because the puppets are &quot;a little bit scary&quot;.- The performers are all Australians, with Australian accents. However they speak quite clearly and we all, including our daughter, can understand them without any trouble. We view this as an advantage, introducing the concept that not all people speak the same way.- The performances are all lip-synched with simulated playing of instruments. The sound is dubbed in later (by the same performers, as far as I know). I assume they did this because it is difficult to get clear sound while your are doing vigorous dance moves. This is mildly annoying to adults, probably unnoticable to kids.",5,Fascinates toddlers and shouldn't annoy adults,991699200,"06 5, 2001",2001,2707,"['wife', 'first', 'encountered', 'Wiggles', 'short', 'ad', 'Barney', 'video', 'performed', 'one', 'song', 'quot', 'Monkey', 'Dance', 'quot', 'lot', 'kids', 'dancing', 'front', 'first', 'attracted', 'interest', 'nearly', 'three-year-old', 'daughter', 'would', 'leap', 'feet', 'dance', 'along', 'marked', 'contrast', 'passive', 'viewing', 'most', 'other', 'videos', 'noticed', 'song', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'wife', 'later', 'saw', 'video', 'store', 'bought', 'are', 'very', 'glad', 'did', 'songs', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'catchy', 'varied', 'singable', 'WILL', 'find', 'songs', 'stuck', 'head', 'day', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'should', ""n't"", 'mind', 'too', 'much', 'lead', 'singer', 'very', 'nice', 'voice', 'friendly', 'warm', 'gentle', 'charisma', 'other', 'three', 'quot', 'Wiggles', 'quot', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'good', 'too', 'dances', 'have', 'simple', 'moves', 'appear', 'be', 'inspired', 'aerobics', 'easy', 'kids', 'imitate', 'Almost', 'speaking', 'done', 'directly', 'camera', 'really', 'draw', 'kids', 'keep', 'attention', 'not', 'much', 'quot', 'educational', 'quot', 'content', 'other', 'children', 'videos', 'songs', 'are', 'more-or-less', 'nonsense', 'exercise', 'factor', 'more', 'compensates', 'daughter', 'feet', 'most', 'show.A', 'few', 'warnings', 'first', 'couple', 'times', 'watched', 'wife', 'were', 'not', 'enthusiastic', 'could', 'tell', 'daughter', 'loved', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'four', 'grown', 'men', 'would', 'do', 'stuff', 'course', 'kids', 'love', 'see', 'grown-ups', 'doing', 'silly', 'things', 'more', 'watched', 'more', 'appreciated', 'now', 'really', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'her.-', 'Two', 'songs', 'are', 'done', 'puppets', 'instead', 'live', 'performers', 'puppets', 'are', 'somwhat', 'macabre', 'huge', 'staring', 'eyes', 'audio', 'sped', 'up', 'songs', 'give', 'quot', 'Alvin', 'Chipmunks', 'quot', 'sound', 'One', 'songs', 'done', 'front', 'psychedelic', 'background', 'colored', 'lights', 'overall', 'effect', 'weird', 'daugter', ""n't"", 'like', 'puppets', 'much', 'one', 'songs', 'just', 'tolerates', 'other', 'usually', 'fast', 'forward', 'puppets', 'are', 'quot', 'little', 'bit', 'scary', 'quot', 'performers', 'are', 'Australians', 'Australian', 'accents', 'However', 'speak', 'quite', 'clearly', 'including', 'daughter', 'can', 'understand', 'trouble', 'view', 'advantage', 'introducing', 'concept', 'not', 'people', 'speak', 'same', 'way.-', 'performances', 'are', 'lip-synched', 'simulated', 'playing', 'instruments', 'sound', 'dubbed', 'later', 'same', 'performers', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'assume', 'did', 'difficult', 'get', 'clear', 'sound', 'are', 'doing', 'vigorous', 'dance', 'moves', 'mildly', 'annoying', 'adults', 'probably', 'unnoticable', 'kids']",N/A
