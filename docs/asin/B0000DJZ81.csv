This doc gives you the story of Chester Arthur Burnett aka Howlin' Wolf as told through friends, former band members, family, and some guys that know the story well. You'll enjoy this well put together tribute to the Blues and one of it's finest, most unique interpreters. Famed record producer Sam Phillips discovered Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Ray Orbison, BB King, Jerry Lee Louis, Charlie Rich, and Howlin' Wolf. Phillips said Elvis was his *second* greatest discovery and Howlin' Wolf was his greatest. I love this quote: ""When I heard Howlin' Wolf, I said, 'This is for me.

779242,AGEIT17HENDIS,B0000DJZ81,Alfred Johnson,"[5, 5]","I have reviewed several of Howlin' Wolf's CDs in this space previously and had expected that this documentary about the life, the times and the influence of this incredible blues performer would merely be an appetizer for further reviews of his music. Not so. This well-done, lovingly put together and extremely informative documentary is a worthy viewing for the novice and old Wolf aficionados like me. Thus, rather than placing this commentary as a tail to some other Wolf entry it is worthy of separate entry here.In this presentation filled, as always in this kind of work, with the inevitable ""talking heads"" we go from Wolf`s roots down in the Mississippi Delta, cotton country and nothing else, in the 1920's and 1930's through to the first stop up the Mississippi at Memphis on to the Mecca Chicago in the post- World War II period and finally to international renown in the blues revival started by the likes of The Rolling Stones in the mid-1960s. In short we are treated to a view of the trajectory of Wolf's life; unlike let us say Son House with whom Wolf worked with in the old days who stuck with the country roots, from country blues of the back road jukes to the electricity of the urban ghetto that made those old blues jump for at first migratory urban blacks and then young whites like this reviewer. Along the way many of the musicians that worked with Wolf like Hubert Sumerlin, a blues guitarist legend in his own right, and Sam Lay as well as Wolf's daughters, the Chess Record producer Marshall Chess and others give some amusing stories and anecdotes on the life of the great bluesman. And seemingly as always when blues or rock and roll are mentioned  little segments with the ubiquitous Sam Phillips of the well-known Sun Recording studio in Memphis.I do not generally comment on (or for that matter look at) the special features sections of DVD. Not doing so here would be a mistake. There is some nice home movie footage, some interesting Wolf stories by his companions and rivals, a nice segment on the rivalry between Wolf and Muddy Waters to be ""King of The Chicago Blues"" and a recording of a radio broadcast of Wolf doing Little Red Rooster. Damn, I flipped out the first time I heard that song when it was covered by The Rolling Stones in the early 1960's. I also flipped out when I first heard a Wolf recording of it. I don't know what I would have done had I heard it on my radio then. Probably started hitchhiking for Chicago.All of this information is nice but I am sure the reader is just as interested to know about the music. Oh yes there is some great footage of classic Wolf efforts. Of course for this reviewer number one is always Wolf's Little Red Rooster. Christ, he is practically eating the harmonica by the end of the song. Lovin' Spoonful, Moaning at Midnight and a host of other songs get their usual Wolf professional treatment. That is a point to be underscored, he was a professional in his approach to the music, its presentation and the way that he could influence a genre that he practically build (along with his competitor Muddy Waters) from scratch. If you need an hour of the Wolf doin' his Midnight Creep then you really have to see this documentary.

Not only does this video provide an in-depth look at the Wolf, it also serves as a more than adequate overview of the blues scene in general during its heyday of the 30's, 40's and 50's...and 60's! Blues took a big backseat to the British Invasion and the blossoming folk scene in the 60's, but the Wolf was one of the very few bluesmen who managed to stay busy and in the limelight during that decade, what with his appearance on the Shindig! TV show at the insistence of the Rolling Stones. The Rolling Stones were already popular back then, but it's very poignant to see the Stones sitting with the rest of the audience during Howlin' Wolf's set, showing the audience hey, welcome to Rock and Roll 101...here's the real deal, one of the SOURCES of our music...WE learn from HIM! That's why we're sitting here in the audience with you!Great original music from the Wolf himself is featured throughout the film, in the form of both performances and background music. How many of us know that Howlin' Wolf was a very good slide guitarist? He exposes that secret in some classic footage of him performing in an informal setting with a drunk Son House getting a little too carried away as a spectator (he was only human), to the chagrin of the Wolf. :-)I had to rush out and purchase the Howlin' Wolf London Sessions album after hearing some tasty tidbits from those sessions in this film! Recent interviews with the living legend Hubert Sumlin are also included, and add plenty of insight into the story of his boss's life. Even the extra features are interesting! Some old home movies of the Wolf and other Chicago bluesmen (including a couple of seconds of the rarely filmed Little Walter) shot by Sam Lay comprise one of the bonus extras. Watch for part of those movies that show the Wolf standing next to Albert King--awesome! Lay's recount of how he was fired from Wolf's band and then hired back again is quite hilarious!For anyone interested in Howlin' Wolf's music, or blues music in general, this DVD is a MUST HAVE!!",5,A perfect bio-pic of a blues legend!,1283990400,"09 9, 2010",2010,2071,"['fine', 'story', 'late', 'great', 'Howlin', 'Wolf', 'Not', 'only', 'video', 'provide', 'in-depth', 'look', 'Wolf', 'also', 'more', 'adequate', 'overview', 'blues', 'scene', 'general', 'heyday', '30', '40', '50', '60', 'Blues', 'took', 'big', 'backseat', 'British', 'Invasion', 'blossoming', 'folk', 'scene', '60', 'Wolf', 'was', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'bluesmen', 'who', 'managed', 'stay', 'busy', 'limelight', 'decade', 'what', 'appearance', 'Shindig', 'TV', 'show', 'insistence', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'were', 'already', 'popular', 'back', 'then', 'very', 'poignant', 'see', 'Stones', 'sitting', 'rest', 'audience', 'Howlin', 'Wolf', 'set', 'showing', 'audience', 'hey', 'welcome', 'Rock', 'Roll', '101', 'here', 'real', 'deal', 'one', 'SOURCES', 'music', 'WE', 'learn', 'HIM', 'why', ""'re"", 'sitting', 'here', 'audience', 'Great', 'original', 'music', 'Wolf', 'featured', 'film', 'form', 'performances', 'background', 'music', 'How', 'many', 'know', 'Howlin', 'Wolf', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'slide', 'guitarist', 'secret', 'classic', 'footage', 'performing', 'informal', 'setting', 'drunk', 'Son', 'House', 'getting', 'little', 'too', 'carried', 'away', 'spectator', 'was', 'only', 'human', 'chagrin', 'Wolf', 'had', 'rush', 'out', 'purchase', 'Howlin', 'Wolf', 'London', 'Sessions', 'album', 'hearing', 'tasty', 'tidbits', 'sessions', 'film', 'Recent', 'interviews', 'living', 'legend', 'Hubert', 'Sumlin', 'are', 'also', 'included', 'add', 'plenty', 'insight', 'story', 'boss', 'life', 'Even', 'extra', 'features', 'are', 'interesting', 'old', 'home', 'movies', 'Wolf', 'other', 'Chicago', 'bluesmen', 'including', 'couple', 'seconds', 'rarely', 'filmed', 'Little', 'Walter', 'shot', 'Sam', 'Lay', 'comprise', 'one', 'bonus', 'extras', 'Watch', 'part', 'movies', 'show', 'Wolf', 'standing', 'next', 'Albert', 'King', 'awesome', 'Lay', 'recount', 'how', 'was', 'fired', 'Wolf', 'band', 'then', 'hired', 'back', 'again', 'quite', 'hilarious', 'anyone', 'interested', 'Howlin', 'Wolf', 'music', 'blues', 'music', 'general', 'DVD', 'MUST', 'HAVE']",N/A

I read about him being a great performer, but there's a difference when you actually see it. The movie starts with his only TV performance, when the Rolling Stones demanded it as a condition for their own participation. It has something to say about American society then, when a group of white British musicians who admittedly attempted to copy Wolf (and Muddy and others)had much more power in America than their black objects of admirations. It is interesting to see Wolf in that show, playing ""How many more years"". He starts quite reservedly, then starts to move like he would in a juke-joint. Except in a juke joint many would move like him and with him, and here on mainstream TV there are girls who clap their hands.There is a sort of confrontation between son House and Wolf, based on House's being drunk and interrupting Wolf's session. The things Wolf tells House are surprising, but I always felt that after the 40's House was a broken man, and sounded like it.A great moment to me is when Bukka White plays, and Wolf leans towards him and asks questions. Bukka answers the questions in singing, and it adds another dimension to the music. This reminds me of something I saw in African bars, when the singer responds to the crowd without stopping to sing, blending his responses with the music. A lost art.Well, see this movie for yourself !",5,Made me an even bigger fan,1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,1447,"['am', 'new', 'DVD', 'market', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'Wolf', 'film', 'thrill', 'read', 'being', 'great', 'performer', 'difference', 'when', 'actually', 'see', 'movie', 'only', 'TV', 'performance', 'when', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'demanded', 'condition', 'own', 'participation', 'something', 'say', 'American', 'society', 'then', 'when', 'group', 'white', 'British', 'musicians', 'who', 'admittedly', 'attempted', 'copy', 'Wolf', 'Muddy', 'others', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'power', 'America', 'black', 'objects', 'admirations', 'interesting', 'see', 'Wolf', 'show', 'playing', 'How', 'many', 'more', 'years', 'quite', 'reservedly', 'then', 'move', 'would', 'juke-joint', 'juke', 'joint', 'many', 'would', 'move', 'here', 'mainstream', 'TV', 'are', 'girls', 'who', 'clap', 'hands.There', 'sort', 'confrontation', 'son', 'House', 'Wolf', 'based', 'House', 'being', 'drunk', 'interrupting', 'Wolf', 'session', 'things', 'Wolf', 'tells', 'House', 'are', 'surprising', 'always', 'felt', '40', 'House', 'was', 'broken', 'man', 'sounded', 'it.A', 'great', 'moment', 'when', 'Bukka', 'White', 'plays', 'Wolf', 'leans', 'towards', 'asks', 'questions', 'Bukka', 'questions', 'singing', 'dimension', 'music', 'something', 'saw', 'African', 'bars', 'when', 'singer', 'crowd', 'stopping', 'sing', 'blending', 'responses', 'music', 'lost', 'art.Well', 'see', 'movie', 'yourself']",N/A
779248,A12S5XTMAHYYME,B0000DJZ81,Perry Celestino,"[71, 74]","Chester Burnett aka Howlin"" Wolf was one of the giants of Blues (Literally!). His music set the standard for the whole Blues genre and led the way vis-a-vis the British Invasion for the 1960s Blues Revival that led to Hendrix, Heavy Metal, Jazz-Fusion, Funk, Rap and so on. Wolf's music was interesting and more varied than any other Bluesman at the time (witness ""Evil"", ""Spoonful"", ""Back Door Man"" and ""Little Red Rooster"", all are different, unlike most of Muddy's tunes (except ones like ""Walking In The Park"").  The Wolf was an innovator and a good writer too. Willie Dixon actually wrote tunes for Wolf like he would have written for himself! Interesting!I had the pleasure of seeing Wolf live in New York in 1967 at the famous Cafe au Go Go's Blues Bag. I will never forget it. The band started playing ""Smokestack Lightning"" and Wolf came out with the spotlight BEHIND him looking like a mountain! He was the standard for all blues singers-rock not gospel like B.B. or soul, like Albert King. He was a great entertainer too.When the Wolf tribute band (Hubert Sumlin and Mojo Buford) came to Australia in 1991 I saw them. I got to meet Hubert, told him about my seeing Wolf in 1967 and he hugged me!! What a thrill!Well this DVD is fabulous and historical. It has a lot of extras and a good lenght (90 min). I have to give it four stars because as a 40 year Blues fan I would have expected more film clips of his performances and if you couldn't find anymore this DVD should have included more bits from his American Folk Blues appearances (there is only one on this DVD). In Scorsese's ""Blues""(Road To Memphis) he has a curious version of Wolf doing ""Evil"" which is not in this DVD!The main reason why I gave this four instead of five stars is that there is not any new or complete concert footage or new tunes. The tunes shown in Black and White have all been released on the Vestapol DVD:  ""Devil Got My Woman"" (This footage has already been used a lot e.g. ""Lightning in a Bottle"" and the ""Blues"" series by Scorsese) along with rare footage of the great Skip James (get this is it actually better than this DVD!)I was expecting some newly released footage of Wolf in color from some of his many appearances in the late 1960s and early seventies. Let's face it, like with the great Albert King-footage of these great Blues Innovators needs to be released in concert format- Like Albert's Ann Arbor Blues Festival set and Wolf's many Blues festival appearances like the Chicago Blues Festivals of the late 1960s.The rest of the film is superb. Sam Lay's home movies and getting to see where the club was that Muddy and Wolf had played at is great (today it's a vacant lot!!). The interviews with his daughter's are also interesting, it seems like Big Wolf was much more a family man than Muddy (see ""Can't be Satisfied"" DVD).

I hope there is more footage out there of the Wolf. This is a must have for any true lover of good old American roots music, you won't be sorry. There are interviews with his daughters also, it gives us more of an idea what he was like as a person, very cool!",5,THE GREAT HOWLIN' WOLF,1075334400,"01 29, 2004",2004,353,"['just', 'bought', 'DVD', 'what', 'treat', 'blew', 'away', 'way', 'better', 'expected', 'far', 'hope', 'more', 'footage', 'there', 'Wolf', 'must', 'have', 'true', 'lover', 'good', 'old', 'American', 'roots', 'music', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'sorry', 'are', 'interviews', 'daughters', 'also', 'more', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'person', 'very', 'cool']",N/A

His daughters, Hubert Sumlin, Marshall Chess, as well as notable blues historians, promoters, musicians, and writers, all add a human dimension to Wolf's mythical persona. Highlights include sublime historical footage of early-'60s Chicago blues clubs with Wolf and Muddy Waters in the house and onstage, as well as excerpts from concert and TV performances by Wolf and his house-rockin' band.",4,Wolf comes alive,1103846400,"12 24, 2004",2004,568,"['lovingly', 'produced', '90-minute', 'DVD', 'documentary', 'Chester', 'Burnett', 'inimitable', 'Howlin', 'Wolf', 'learn', 'man', 'music', 'who', 'knew', 'best', 'daughters', 'Hubert', 'Sumlin', 'Marshall', 'Chess', 'as', 'well', 'notable', 'blues', 'historians', 'promoters', 'musicians', 'writers', 'add', 'human', 'dimension', 'Wolf', 'mythical', 'persona', 'Highlights', 'include', 'sublime', 'historical', 'footage', ""early-'60s"", 'Chicago', 'blues', 'clubs', 'Wolf', 'Muddy', 'Waters', 'house', 'onstage', 'as', 'well', 'excerpts', 'concert', 'TV', 'performances', 'Wolf', 'house-rockin', 'band']",N/A
