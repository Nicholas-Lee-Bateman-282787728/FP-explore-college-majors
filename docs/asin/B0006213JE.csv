I do both Tae-bo tapes and Leslie Sansone walking tapes and I like them both equally. I just wanted someone who is considering buying this to know that if you have already been working out with Tae-bo ( specifically the Basic tape) then this will be less intense for you. Still fun, but less intense.I love Leslie. I think she is an excellent instructor. She will motivate you and you will be back for more! Guarantee it.

If you're already quite fit and looking for a challenging, back breaking cardio experience, these videos are probably not for you.  I use a heart rate monitor and was able to get my heart bpm up to 160 by putting extra effort in, so that's a decent cardio rate for fat burning.  I worked up a light sweat during this workout and felt like I had a decent work out as a result.The kickboxing moves were fairly limited and easily modifiable, so there's no reason for anyone to be intimidated by the addition of these moves to Leslie's usual routine.  The 'Walk Away the Pounds' video series can be fairly repetitive with the same moves repeated over and over in every single program, but that doesn't bother me since I enjoy Leslie's high energy and optimistic, encouraging personality.  The kickboxing does add some nice variety to the usual shtick, so I did appreciate the addition.Using only Leslie's videos, some strength training, and a more controlled diet, I've been able to lose over 10 pounds in a month and I feel like these videos are a big part of my success.  Obviously, what you eat is the most important aspect of weight loss, but these videos get me moving enough that I feel more energized afterwards as opposed to completely wringed out.  For people interested in other videos by Leslie, I recommendLeslie Sansone: Walk Away The Pounds: Express Super Challenge,Walk Away the Pounds the Morning Mile Plus AbsandWalk Away the Pounds with Leslie Sansone - The Evening Mile Plus Legs.

You still the enthusiasm that you get in all her videos.  You will do four stints of power walking and then slow it down for four kick boxing stints.

The first interval is a combination of mini squats, bobbing and weaving, and cross punches and uppercuts. The second interval is more focused on kicking - front kicks and back kicks. The third interval has you placing your hip towards the TV, shifting your weight back and forth while moving your hands like you were punching a feed bag.

Once we got back to walking, it picked right up again.That's not to say that I didn't like the DVD, though!  As usual, Leslie is her chipper self and keeps you motivated throughout.  I will definitely be popping this back in on the days when I really don't want to exercise, but need to since it's not quite as demanding as some of her others.

With the workout being shorter than the 3, 4, and 5 mile ones that I have been doing, I felt like it would really need to go at a fast pace to burn even a comparable amount of calories.  The intervals of kickboxing, however, slowed the pace to the point where I had to really exaggerate all my movements (much more than Leslie herself does) to even feel that my heartrate was elevated.  Another annoyance was the ""walk instructor"" to the right of the leader was continually marching on the opposite foot as well as overdoing everything that Leslie did.  The sets on her videos are usually pretty spare but that doesn't bother me, whereas this one was more elaborate but lit wierdly so you could see all the walkers shadows on the floor.  If you watch these videos every day or several times a week, little things stick out.

Since then, I've also done the 3 mile WATP and 2 of the WalkAerobics and feel this is definitely less intense than any of the others.  This is not to say it's not an enjoyable workout, but I didn't really work up a sweat, which I have with all the others - I'm an intermediate exerciser.The workout starts at a faster pace than any of the others I've done and she uses the same 4 steps found in her other workouts - side steps, front kick, knee lift and back kick (hamstring curl).She drops the pace for the 4 ""kickboxing"" segments.  If you're worried about the kickboxing element of this workout, I assure you that it is FAR less intense than anything seen in the Billy Blanks Tae Bo workouts.  Unless - or even if you're a beginner, I wouldn't think you'd find them exerting or strenuous, but they do add for a little variety.  These segments are fairly gentle and brief in duration.Leslie was pleasant and motivating.  She's stopped cueing ""left"" or ""right"" and now taps the side of the body she's going to move first and says ""this side"", which is better if she's not going to mirror her cues.  This would be helpful to those who want to exercise with no sound (or to your own music).  There is one section toward the end of the last kickboxing segment where the pace steps up and Leslie doesn't keep time with it and seems to get a bit mixed up as to what she should be doing, which was a little disconcerting the first time through, but less so the next times I've used it.  One of the instructors in blue (Mary Kay, I think) really gets into her moves, so it's visually distracting when she's out of step with the rest of them (she does the same thing in another workout).  That said, there are few, if any, workout videos that don't have someone who mis-steps and it adds a bit of reality to them, in my opinion.Overall, this was a nice workout, but not as intense as I expected given the Power Series designation and the addition of kickboxing moves.  I haven't been able to find any indication of the length of mileage covered in the packaging, nor do I recall Leslie saying anything about it, which is a first for any of her other workouts.  For the same amount of time, I'd rather do the 2 Mile Walkaerobics in the Deluxe Edition or the 30 Minute (2 mile) Walk for more intensity.

I wouldn't necessarily recommend this to WATP beginners, or those who are very inactive.  I didn't realize how out of shape I was until my first set by her started kicking(or walking really) me back into shape.  I bought this DVD looking for something a little more intense, a little more challenging, a little different, but also not as long as some of her more intense workouts.  I consider myself an intermediate walker.This workout is approximately 30 minutes long and consists of her four basic moves: walking, side steps, knee lifts, and kicks.  It also includes some kick backs (my favorite!  love that stretch), double side steps, mini squats, and her kicking intervals.  It begins with the warm-up, than goes smoothly into a very fast walk.  She has 4 other walkers with her, who she occasionally talks to but the only chatting in this video is from herself.  I enjoyed the music on this DVD especially; it is modern, with a kind of a techno-dance beat and really kept me going and involved in the walking intervals.  The kicking intervals are meant to simulate the basic movements of kickboxing.  I liked them as they kept the intensity up, used kickboxing moves, but without the complexity and impossible coordination typically involved in other workouts (like Tae Bo).  She goes through 4 kicking intervals and after a few times through it they really fly by, it was the more intense walking periods (especially the bit with the double knee lifts) that really got my heart pumping.I recommend this DVD to those who are already in fairly good shape and looking to get into one of Leslie's workouts, or those familiar with WATP and looking for a step up.

Now I am in much better shape and can do kickboxing easily.  I still come back to the DVD whenI need a light workout.

Leslie has been the only fitness instructor I have worked out with in the past four months and her programs are very, very effective!  I'm down 41 pounds (in a little over five months) by eating healthier and rotating her DVDs just about daily.  This DVD provides some easy kickboxing moves and is perfect for me at 52 years old!  If you're short on time, I highly recommend this DVD.  It is only about 30 minutes long and you do work up a sweat!",5,Nice Addition to My Collection of Leslie Workouts!,1220227200,"09 1, 2008",2008,518,"['am', 'glad', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'variety', 'workouts', 'Leslie', 'been', 'only', 'fitness', 'instructor', 'have', 'worked', 'out', 'past', 'four', 'months', 'programs', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'effective', ""'m"", 'down', '41', 'pounds', 'little', 'five', 'months', 'eating', 'healthier', 'rotating', 'DVDs', 'just', 'daily', 'DVD', 'easy', 'kickboxing', 'moves', 'perfect', '52', 'years', 'old', ""'re"", 'short', 'time', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'only', 'about', '30', 'minutes', 'long', 'do', 'work', 'up', 'sweat']",N/A
