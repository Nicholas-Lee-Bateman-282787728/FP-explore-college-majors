Combined with some, what seems to me unneeded and totally phony fantasy. Why did Rainey need to drive a car? But..... kids (10 and 6 yol) watched through it and had some laughs. Rating 3 stars because of that that. My 6 yol liked the scene where Rainey is shooting tennis balls at the bully.",3,mwa.... so-so,1295222400,"01 17, 2011",2011,402,"['Possible', 'spoiler', 'alert.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'particular', 'movie', 'Too', 'melodramatic', 'Where', 'fun', 'Combined', 'what', 'unneeded', 'totally', 'phony', 'fantasy', 'Why', 'did', 'Rainey', 'need', 'drive', 'car', '..', 'kids', '10', '6', 'yol', 'watched', 'had', 'laughs', 'Rating', '3', 'stars', '6', 'yol', 'liked', 'scene', 'where', 'Rainey', 'shooting', 'tennis', 'balls', 'bully']",Cool Dog

1384036,A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF,B004393V64,G. Teslovich,"[1, 5]","Add this up (or subtract it depending on point of view):1. 90% of the film credits for the lead actors consists of B movies no one has ever heard of, or TV spots. Hmmm, I wonder what that suggests?2. Storyline of dog as small town icon; is left behind by family that is moving far far away; is left in the care of a ne'er-do-well run animal hospice; takes off but only after creating a bit of havoc in letting animal captives in hospice loose; to find boy owner in far away place; performs acts that only humans can perform; finally receives award ceremony for catching bad people (usual parade, speeches, ribbons and mayor). Nothing creative, every scene ripped off from countless previous dog movies.3. Really bad human acting with wooden, read-the-teleprompter, scripts and emotionless acting to back it up. Except for the painfully obvious glycerine tears for actors incapable of eliciting real tears.4. The most fake animal scenes since the '50s. Dog running from point A to point B, treat, cut & edit, B to C, treat, cut & edit, etc; propped dog driving police car and tugboat with hands on steering wheels; dog playing piano except all you see are artificial dog limbs moving across a keyboard; dog and other animals dancing by reverse film editing of some simple movement -  many times, over and over. Boring. No wonder animals end up being so mistreated when children grow up thinking that this is what they're suppose to act like - only to be disappointed. And dog moves to rap music - must be marketing/persuading to a young audience.5. Dog dies but God is persuaded to spend time resurrecting the dog rather than let's say some lowly human child.Total:-5",1,"Just Bad, Really Bad",1307318400,"06 6, 2011",2011,1666,"['Add', 'up', 'subtract', 'depending', 'point', 'view', ':1', '90', '%', 'film', 'credits', 'lead', 'actors', 'B', 'movies', 'one', 'ever', 'heard', 'TV', 'spots', 'Hmmm', 'wonder', 'what', '2', 'Storyline', 'dog', 'small', 'town', 'icon', 'left', 'family', 'moving', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'left', 'care', ""ne'er-do-well"", 'run', 'animal', 'hospice', 'only', 'creating', 'bit', 'havoc', 'letting', 'animal', 'captives', 'hospice', 'loose', 'find', 'boy', 'owner', 'far', 'away', 'place', 'performs', 'only', 'humans', 'can', 'perform', 'finally', 'award', 'ceremony', 'catching', 'bad', 'people', 'usual', 'parade', 'speeches', 'ribbons', 'mayor', 'Nothing', 'creative', 'scene', 'ripped', 'off', 'countless', 'previous', 'dog', 'movies.3', 'Really', 'bad', 'human', 'acting', 'wooden', 'read-the-teleprompter', 'scripts', 'emotionless', 'acting', 'back', 'up', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'glycerine', 'tears', 'actors', 'incapable', 'eliciting', 'real', 'tears.4', 'most', 'fake', 'animal', 'scenes', ""'50s"", 'Dog', 'running', 'point', 'point', 'B', 'treat', 'cut', 'edit', 'B', 'C', 'treat', 'cut', 'edit', 'etc', 'propped', 'dog', 'driving', 'police', 'car', 'tugboat', 'hands', 'steering', 'wheels', 'dog', 'playing', 'piano', 'see', 'are', 'artificial', 'dog', 'limbs', 'moving', 'keyboard', 'dog', 'other', 'animals', 'dancing', 'reverse', 'film', 'editing', 'simple', 'movement', 'many', 'times', 'over', 'Boring', 'wonder', 'animals', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'so', 'mistreated', 'when', 'children', 'grow', 'up', 'thinking', 'what', ""'re"", 'suppose', 'act', 'only', 'be', 'disappointed', 'dog', 'moves', 'rap', 'music', 'must', 'be', 'marketing/persuading', 'young', 'audience.5', 'Dog', 'God', 'persuaded', 'spend', 'time', 'resurrecting', 'dog', 'rather', 'let', 'say', 'lowly', 'human', 'child.Total', '-5']",Cool Dog
