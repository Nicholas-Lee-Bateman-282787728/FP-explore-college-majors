One ordinary morning in an unnamed contemporary city, three people, all strangers to each other, go about their own lives. The story alternates among them, shows each encountering hardship of one kind or another....Thanks to the intervention of their guardian angels, they find themselves on their way to the same Mass at a beautiful local parish [The exterior of the church building seems strikingly like Florence's Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore.].  At Mass, the angels encourage the three characters, instructing them on such things as preparing oneself for Mass, the existence of Purgatory, and how to pray....The portrayal of Jesus, in particular, is refreshingly reverential. This movie deserves a wide audience.""While I share the Catholic League's enthusiams, I also agree with 12/9/11 cautions offered by in a review on Catholic Lane: ""the concept of using film to explore what is going on spiritually in Mass is a wonderful idea. There are some truly memorable scenes in this artful movie....But there are some real problems with the story, if you are hoping for something that is entirely true to the faith....this is one animated film about the Catholic faith that I would not recommend for young children.

1584431,A120V3RVSK1O1K,B00930LING,K. Ostrowski,"[7, 9]","This movie is a short, animated feature; just a little over an hour long, with 3d computer graphics to represent characters and such, and it's entirely faithful to the teachings of the Catholic Church.  Just wanted to say that right up front, since this alone accounts for 2 and a half of the stars I give to a film like this one.The premise is that a few people; a struggling single mother, a busdriver worried about his sick son, and an elderly, faithful Catholic woman are all drawn to a church by the same young man.  Once there, they begin to have visions; seeing what really goes on in that church.  They see demons, angels, saints, suffering souls and what part Jesus and the Blessed Mother play in it all.Some scenes (particularly the ones with the Blessed Mother and Jesus) are genuinely touching, and I almost wept at a few of them, which should give you some idea of just how well this film does its job.Nevertheless, if I could, I would give this film four and a half stars, and there are a few reasons why.The first is the animation.  While the character models are beautiful and extremely well-designed, the actual animation is rather lackluster when compared to the sort of thing produced by real movie studies.  I mention this first, because I found it just a bit distracting throughout the entire movie.Secondly, the movie is -immensely- stilted, and its aesthetic leaves much to be desired.  I know that may be an odd thing to say, right after remarking on how it made me almost weep, but it's always a problem whenever angels are made to look overtly-feminine, Jesus and Mary -act- like plaster statues, and the relationship with Jesus is painted as largely a matter of reflection, contemplation and emoting.  The film does attempt to establish that more is involved than mere feelings, but it also seems to imply that those who have ""the wrong motives"" for doing good are second-class citizens in God's eyes; an old notion, which I've attempted to refute in previous reviews.  It doesn't say this overtly, however, or I'd put more effort into refuting it here.The reason the church has lost members in recent years is that it has lost men, and like it or not; whether it makes us happy or not, most of the men who might be drawn to religion are not like the father in this film; they're not at the brink of despair over some personal tragedy and willing to listen to anybody who might give them hope.The way you draw men into a proper understanding of the faith is by -avoiding- the feminine elements.  Explain that angels are mighty warriors (they're called the heavenly hosts for a reason, you know,) that the Catholic life is a spiritual war, that the sacraments are a form of power, and that our relationship with Jesus need not be some touchy-feely-hippie garbage; that it can be like the relationship between a soldier and the general who commands him.  You draw men in by not trying to calm them down.  They just get bored by that.I still enjoyed this film, of course.  It's got a few other hiccups, apart from these two, but nothing significant.  As far as whether it's something to show to kids, there's no real cursing, bloodshed, sex or anything.  Characters shout at each other early on, and death is dealt with.  Also, the demons might be a little scary for young viewers, but my main worry with younger viewers would be the same as my worry with grown men; they might just get bored with all the angelic monologues and the slow pace of the movie, and decide not to watch anymore.I would recommend this movie, mainly, to those who are already serious about their faith and want to see it illustrated in a film.  It's short enough that you can watch it some afternoon after work, and you might get something out of it.  I know I did.  I just wouldn't use it as a convert wedge.  Strengthen your faith with this gem, and make the converts yourself instead.",5,"I wish I could give it a half star down, but absolutely no more than that",1355875200,"12 19, 2012",2012,3887,"['movie', 'short', 'animated', 'feature', 'just', 'little', 'hour', 'long', '3d', 'computer', 'graphics', 'represent', 'characters', 'such', 'entirely', 'faithful', 'teachings', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'Just', 'wanted', 'say', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'alone', 'accounts', '2', 'half', 'stars', 'give', 'film', 'one.The', 'premise', 'few', 'people', 'struggling', 'single', 'mother', 'busdriver', 'worried', 'sick', 'son', 'elderly', 'faithful', 'Catholic', 'woman', 'are', 'drawn', 'church', 'same', 'young', 'man', 'Once', 'there', 'begin', 'have', 'visions', 'seeing', 'what', 'really', 'church', 'see', 'demons', 'angels', 'saints', 'suffering', 'souls', 'what', 'part', 'Jesus', 'Blessed', 'Mother', 'play', 'all.Some', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'ones', 'Blessed', 'Mother', 'Jesus', 'are', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'almost', 'wept', 'few', 'should', 'give', 'idea', 'just', 'how', 'well', 'film', 'job.Nevertheless', 'could', 'would', 'give', 'film', 'four', 'half', 'stars', 'are', 'few', 'reasons', 'why.The', 'first', 'animation', 'character', 'models', 'are', 'beautiful', 'extremely', 'well-designed', 'actual', 'animation', 'rather', 'lackluster', 'when', 'compared', 'sort', 'thing', 'produced', 'real', 'movie', 'studies', 'mention', 'first', 'found', 'just', 'bit', 'distracting', 'entire', 'movie.Secondly', 'movie', '-immensely-', 'stilted', 'aesthetic', 'leaves', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'know', 'may', 'be', 'odd', 'thing', 'say', 'right', 'remarking', 'how', 'made', 'almost', 'weep', 'always', 'problem', 'whenever', 'angels', 'are', 'made', 'look', 'overtly-feminine', 'Jesus', 'Mary', '-act-', 'plaster', 'statues', 'relationship', 'Jesus', 'painted', 'largely', 'matter', 'reflection', 'contemplation', 'emoting', 'film', 'attempt', 'establish', 'more', 'involved', 'mere', 'feelings', 'also', 'imply', 'who', 'have', 'wrong', 'motives', 'doing', 'good', 'are', 'second-class', 'citizens', 'God', 'eyes', 'old', 'notion', ""'ve"", 'attempted', 'refute', 'previous', 'reviews', ""n't"", 'say', 'overtly', 'however', ""'d"", 'put', 'more', 'effort', 'refuting', 'here.The', 'reason', 'church', 'lost', 'members', 'recent', 'years', 'lost', 'men', 'not', 'happy', 'not', 'most', 'men', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'drawn', 'religion', 'are', 'not', 'father', 'film', ""'re"", 'not', 'brink', 'despair', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'willing', 'listen', 'anybody', 'who', 'might', 'give', 'hope.The', 'way', 'draw', 'men', 'proper', 'understanding', 'faith', '-avoiding-', 'feminine', 'elements', 'Explain', 'angels', 'are', 'mighty', 'warriors', ""'re"", 'called', 'heavenly', 'hosts', 'reason', 'know', 'Catholic', 'life', 'spiritual', 'war', 'sacraments', 'are', 'form', 'power', 'relationship', 'Jesus', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'touchy-feely-hippie', 'garbage', 'can', 'be', 'relationship', 'soldier', 'general', 'who', 'draw', 'men', 'not', 'trying', 'calm', 'down', 'just', 'get', 'bored', 'that.I', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'course', 'got', 'few', 'other', 'hiccups', 'apart', 'two', 'nothing', 'significant', 'As', 'far', 'something', 'show', 'kids', 'real', 'cursing', 'bloodshed', 'sex', 'anything', 'Characters', 'shout', 'other', 'early', 'death', 'dealt', 'Also', 'demons', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'scary', 'young', 'viewers', 'main', 'worry', 'younger', 'viewers', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'worry', 'grown', 'men', 'might', 'just', 'get', 'bored', 'angelic', 'monologues', 'slow', 'pace', 'movie', 'decide', 'not', 'watch', 'anymore.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'mainly', 'who', 'are', 'already', 'serious', 'faith', 'want', 'see', 'illustrated', 'film', 'short', 'enough', 'can', 'watch', 'afternoon', 'work', 'might', 'get', 'something', 'know', 'did', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'use', 'convert', 'wedge', 'Strengthen', 'faith', 'gem', 'make', 'converts', 'instead']",The Greatest Miracle

1584433,A18CAKNONUN3Q4,B00930LING,"LARS ""Capper""","[1, 2]","I loved this movie.  The message is wonderful.  The problem with the movie is the (slightly) awful animation of the characters, they move like blocks most of the time and the ""amatuerish-ness"" of the display of characters is a little distracting.  If you can get past that and listen to the dialogue, it's really thought-provoking.  I think if you are open to conversion, you will find this movie amazing.  The angels might not be what you think of them -- too much like birds? in the movie -- but if you listen to what they say, and what they do, it's very very comforting and hopeful.  The demons in the movie are a little scary, but it explains how they do try to distract you from Loving God.  The movie shows you the importance of loving our Merciful God deeper and being sincere in prayer.  I highly recommend this movie and do not mean to be too harsh on the delivery of the product.  The message is amazing and reminds us once again the Awesomeness and Sacredness that we should practice when attending Mass.",5,"Thought provoking, enlightening and very spiritual",1374710400,"07 25, 2013",2013,1016,"['loved', 'movie', 'message', 'wonderful', 'problem', 'movie', 'slightly', 'awful', 'animation', 'characters', 'move', 'blocks', 'most', 'time', 'amatuerish-ness', 'display', 'characters', 'little', 'distracting', 'can', 'get', 'past', 'listen', 'dialogue', 'really', 'thought-provoking', 'think', 'are', 'open', 'conversion', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'amazing', 'angels', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'think', 'too', 'much', 'birds', 'movie', 'listen', 'what', 'say', 'what', 'do', 'very', 'very', 'comforting', 'hopeful', 'demons', 'movie', 'are', 'little', 'scary', 'how', 'do', 'try', 'distract', 'Loving', 'God', 'movie', 'importance', 'loving', 'Merciful', 'God', 'deeper', 'being', 'sincere', 'prayer', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'mean', 'be', 'too', 'harsh', 'delivery', 'product', 'message', 'amazing', 'once', 'again', 'Awesomeness', 'Sacredness', 'should', 'practice', 'when', 'attending', 'Mass']",The Greatest Miracle

1584442,A3QUTLN2YLW30Z,B00930LING,Thomas Zabiega,"[11, 12]","This is an amazing animated movie about the Mass as well as Catholic teachings associated with it.  If someone, Catholic or not, wants to understand what Confession, Communion, Mass, Purgatory, the Blessed Virgin Mary, Angels and Intercessory Prayer are, this is the movie that will explain it to you. It is done within the context of three stories, that of a young widow with a teenage son, a man whose son is dying of cancer, and an elderly woman at the end of her life, which makes the movie more profound and will appeal to everyone.  My children (6 and 4) can never get enough of this animated movie, yet as an adult I find it to be one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen.  I gave it to someone to use it for RCIA (preparing adults to join the Catholic Church) and the people who saw this loved it, as there are few better resources in explaining the Catholic faith clearly and with such strength to adults and children.  In addition, the music is simply heavenly.  The score is all original by Mark McKenzie (who has written the score for several Hollywood movies) and is simply so beautiful you could close your eyes throughout the entire movie and simply enjoy that by itself, though obviously it is better while watching the movie.  There is a Spanish and English language version on this DVD, but there is a separate DVD with the Spanish title ""El Gran Milagro"" which is Spanish only.  The only difference is that in this version the priest in the movie is without glasses (looks younger) and the coins shown are American, while in the ""El Gran Milagro"" version the priest wears glasses (looks older) and the coins are Mexican.  And the texts in the movie are in Spanish vs. English in this movie.  So it really doesn't matter which version you will purchase if you want a Spanish version.  The experience of watching this movie will move you profoundly and may even rekindle your faith life.",5,Best Movie about the Mass ever for children and adults,1371945600,"06 23, 2013",2013,1911,"['amazing', 'animated', 'movie', 'Mass', 'as', 'well', 'Catholic', 'teachings', 'associated', 'someone', 'Catholic', 'not', 'understand', 'what', 'Confession', 'Communion', 'Mass', 'Purgatory', 'Blessed', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'Angels', 'Intercessory', 'Prayer', 'are', 'movie', 'will', 'explain', 'done', 'context', 'three', 'stories', 'young', 'widow', 'teenage', 'son', 'man', 'son', 'dying', 'cancer', 'elderly', 'woman', 'end', 'life', 'movie', 'more', 'profound', 'will', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'children', '6', '4', 'can', 'never', 'get', 'enough', 'animated', 'movie', 'yet', 'adult', 'find', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'amazing', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'gave', 'someone', 'use', 'RCIA', 'preparing', 'adults', 'join', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'people', 'who', 'saw', 'loved', 'are', 'few', 'better', 'resources', 'explaining', 'Catholic', 'faith', 'clearly', 'such', 'strength', 'adults', 'children', 'addition', 'music', 'simply', 'heavenly', 'score', 'original', 'Mark', 'McKenzie', 'who', 'written', 'score', 'several', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'simply', 'so', 'beautiful', 'could', 'close', 'eyes', 'entire', 'movie', 'simply', 'enjoy', 'though', 'obviously', 'better', 'watching', 'movie', 'Spanish', 'English', 'language', 'version', 'DVD', 'separate', 'DVD', 'Spanish', 'title', 'El', 'Gran', 'Milagro', 'Spanish', 'only', 'only', 'difference', 'version', 'priest', 'movie', 'glasses', 'younger', 'coins', 'shown', 'are', 'American', 'El', 'Gran', 'Milagro', 'version', 'priest', 'wears', 'glasses', 'older', 'coins', 'are', 'Mexican', 'texts', 'movie', 'are', 'Spanish', 'vs.', 'English', 'movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'version', 'will', 'purchase', 'want', 'Spanish', 'version', 'experience', 'watching', 'movie', 'will', 'move', 'profoundly', 'may', 'even', 'rekindle', 'faith', 'life']",The Greatest Miracle
