Keeps his interest, unlike the other ones (Elmosize, dance along and gegt up and groove).  He cannot get enough of Grover and Cookie Monster on this, lots of puppet action!!

She literally JUMPS all over the place to keep up with Elmo, Ernie, Big Bird, Cookie Monster, Zoe and all the Sesame gang as they sing and dance to silly songs.Excercise is so important for kids of any age, and this introduction to fitness is just what we were looking for.  It's downright FUN!  It's the first and only DVD that got our child OFF THE COUCH and kept her entertained while teaching something at the same time.It also goes over healthy eating habits, i.e., fruits, yogurt, cheese and vegetables, and our daughter loves to receit each food item as they appear on the screen.  There are fun songs about eating right too, and this adds to the fun of learning.Unlike some of the other Elmo's World and Sesame Street DVD's which our children will outgrow, this one is a definite keeper as they get older!",5,One of our faves...,1111104000,"03 18, 2005",2005,880,"['lively', 'DVD', 'just', 'what', 'needed', 'jump-start', 'toddler', 'literally', 'JUMPS', 'place', 'keep', 'up', 'Elmo', 'Ernie', 'Big', 'Bird', 'Cookie', 'Monster', 'Zoe', 'Sesame', 'gang', 'sing', 'dance', 'silly', 'songs.Excercise', 'so', 'important', 'kids', 'age', 'introduction', 'fitness', 'just', 'what', 'were', 'looking', 'downright', 'FUN', 'first', 'only', 'DVD', 'got', 'child', 'COUCH', 'kept', 'entertained', 'teaching', 'something', 'same', 'time.It', 'also', 'healthy', 'eating', 'habits', 'i.e.', 'fruits', 'yogurt', 'cheese', 'vegetables', 'daughter', 'receit', 'food', 'item', 'appear', 'screen', 'are', 'fun', 'songs', 'eating', 'right', 'too', 'fun', 'learning.Unlike', 'other', 'Elmo', 'World', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'DVD', 'children', 'will', 'outgrow', 'one', 'definite', 'keeper', 'get', 'older']",N/A
868622,A1IANEBSMVGHS9,B0006IIO36,"Manny Hernandez ""@askmanny""","[0, 0]","Ever since we got ""Happy Healthy Monsters"" for our son, he has become an advocate of jumping. He's ""jumping"" everywhere he goes and invites everyone around him  (""Come on Daddy, jump!"") to join in. I am happy to see this, because a few months ago he was a bit on the ""lazy"" side (perhaps his workaholic parents that stared for long periods at the computer screen were not the best example). So, though we now have a living spring bouncing around the house, that seems to be a good 'problem' to have in this world of sedentary and overweight kids.",5,A great way to make exercize fun for your kids,1159833600,"10 3, 2006",2006,546,"['Ever', 'got', 'Happy', 'Healthy', 'Monsters', 'son', 'become', 'advocate', 'jumping', 'jumping', 'everywhere', 'everyone', 'Come', 'Daddy', 'jump', 'join', 'am', 'happy', 'see', 'few', 'months', 'was', 'bit', 'lazy', 'side', 'perhaps', 'workaholic', 'parents', 'stared', 'long', 'periods', 'computer', 'screen', 'were', 'not', 'best', 'example', 'So', 'now', 'have', 'living', 'spring', 'bouncing', 'house', 'be', 'good', ""'problem"", 'have', 'world', 'sedentary', 'overweight', 'kids']",N/A
