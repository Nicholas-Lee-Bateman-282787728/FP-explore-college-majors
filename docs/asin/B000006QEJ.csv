494853,A3FWG7MQCLAQVG,B000006QEJ,D. Thomas,"[4, 4]","A good biography of Ted Bundy.  It's very scary that someone can look and act so normal and have this horrible, murderous, hidden other side. Not all serial killers look like monsters.  That's what's so scary.

494855,A3KWF0Z9R8TIHM,B000006QEJ,HoneyBadgerReviews,"[0, 0]","This Biography presentation of Ted Bundy provides a good overview of his early life, his crimes, and his ultimate conviction.  It has lots of still photos and interviews with people he knew.  There are also some re-enactments of various events that took place in the course of his crimes.One interviewee is Ann Rule, who did volunteer work alongside Ted Bundy in the 1970s, and later wrote the blockbuster true-crime book 'The Stranger Beside Me'.  They also interview others who knew Bundy and thought he was a promising and intelligent young man, but it was all a facade.On the downside the presentation glosses over his victims and does not mention even half of them.  There are some chilling details with some of these cases and those were barely mentioned.  Also, the re-enactments were mediocre at best.  While I recommend the DVD it could have provided more details instead  of the re-enactments which added little to the documentary.",3,"Good overview of Bundy, but lacks some details",1369699200,"05 28, 2013",2013,941,"['Biography', 'presentation', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'good', 'overview', 'early', 'life', 'crimes', 'ultimate', 'conviction', 'lots', 'still', 'photos', 'interviews', 'people', 'knew', 'are', 'also', 're-enactments', 'various', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'course', 'crimes.One', 'interviewee', 'Ann', 'Rule', 'who', 'did', 'volunteer', 'work', 'alongside', 'Ted', 'Bundy', '1970s', 'later', 'wrote', 'blockbuster', 'true-crime', 'book', 'Stranger', 'Beside', 'Me', 'also', 'interview', 'others', 'who', 'knew', 'Bundy', 'thought', 'was', 'promising', 'intelligent', 'young', 'man', 'was', 'facade.On', 'downside', 'presentation', 'victims', 'not', 'mention', 'even', 'half', 'are', 'chilling', 'details', 'cases', 'were', 'barely', 'mentioned', 'Also', 're-enactments', 'were', 'mediocre', 'best', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'could', 'have', 'provided', 'more', 'details', 'instead', 're-enactments', 'added', 'little', 'documentary']",Biography - Ted Bundy VHS

Page ""movie fan""","[8, 8]","Ted Bundy got what he wanted, everyone knows who he was and what he did and in some respects I know that I am one of many keeping this ""Things"" story still alive and I sometimes wonder if ""WE"" are his last victims. Even though this is an gripping bio on Ted and we see him as he really was, it shows the hold he has over us all. Ted's story is one of great sadness,loss, and missed chances. As one author has stated, ""In the end of Ted's story everyone loses, no one wins except Ted who got his wish to be remembered as a famous man"". Well he got it and we still know little about him because he was skilled at hiding, even from himself.",5,"A chilling look at the heart of a ""monster""",1185840000,"07 31, 2007",2007,637,"['Ted', 'Bundy', 'got', 'what', 'wanted', 'everyone', 'knows', 'who', 'was', 'what', 'did', 'respects', 'know', 'am', 'one', 'many', 'keeping', 'Things', 'story', 'still', 'alive', 'sometimes', 'wonder', 'WE', 'are', 'last', 'victims', 'Even', 'gripping', 'bio', 'Ted', 'see', 'really', 'was', 'hold', 'over', 'Ted', 'story', 'one', 'great', 'sadness', 'loss', 'missed', 'chances', 'one', 'author', 'stated', 'end', 'Ted', 'story', 'everyone', 'one', 'Ted', 'who', 'got', 'wish', 'be', 'remembered', 'famous', 'man', 'Well', 'got', 'still', 'know', 'little', 'was', 'skilled', 'hiding', 'even']",Biography - Ted Bundy VHS
