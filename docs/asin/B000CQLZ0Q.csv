960095,AX8UXTLF70B8Q,B000CQLZ0Q,3-006,"[13, 24]","This was one of the most disappointing movie-watching experiences I have ever had. I was totaly duped by the unreliable film critics not to mention the false advertising promoting the movie.After watching this you will not be at all surprised that it was based on a comic book, err...graphic novel. All the dialogue was absolutely atrocious. Some of the worst lines ever.  The sex scenes were goofy, a man and his wife having extremely awkward sex like they were first timers. One of which had the man raping his wife with her seemingly enjoying and welcoming it like in the infamous scene from Straw Dogs. Marie Bello's body looked like a dried up old woman and made me sick. And the cuffs did not quite match the collars.The initial scene is a rip-off of David Lynch with ominous bad guys acting mysterious, but then turns into typical Hollywood violence with just a couple of madmen on the loose apparently shooting everyone they come across.The pacing was slow with no reason for the viewer to think as there is nothing to think about or attempt to figure out. At the end when Viggo admits he is a gangster he suddenly adopts the most absurdly bad east coast gangster accent I have ever heard....that is until WIlliam Hurt started talking. Hurt gives one of the most ridiulous bad guy performances I've ever seen as a nerdy guy who is supposed to be some kind of bad dude but inspired no fear or forboding whatsoever. This was even worse then his Lost In Space atrocity. Of course in true Hollywood yahoo style Viggo kills everyone with extreme ease but nobody can kill him - like Die Hard except boring.The protagonist's kid gets bullied constantly in school and then all of a sudden morphs into a combination of Bruce Lee and Mike Tyson and kicks the living crap out of two tough guys which reminded me of Spiderman except at least that character had super powers which allowd him to turn into a one-man wrecking crew. Brutal. Total rip-off of Spiderman. I was expecting him to do a backflip or something.The whole Big Finale was a joke with Mafia guys with Irish names acting tough but looking stupid with unrealistic accents spewing silly dopey dialogue which sounded like it was written by junior high kids. The whole part when Hurt is telling Viggo why he never got married is an expmple of bad insipid writing. ""Because there's so many beautiful women out there why commit to just one? And cheating is too complicated, its not even worth it.""  !!! A gangster who can't handle the task of cheating on his wife. Like a gangster's wife would even care anyway. Really stupid and pathetic. Then they attempt to kill him with a garrot like this is some sneaky assassination scene. There are guys behind him, why not just shoot him? I was surprised that William Hurt didn't have a swimming pool with sharks with laser beams attached to their freaking heads. Then Hurt tries to shoot him from 8 feet away and can't get the job done. Tough guy! The whole Mansion/Finale scene may have been the worst five minutes in movie-making history. I would have laughed, but it was just so lame and boring...Lots more completely idiotic senseless things happen. At the end he leaves the mansion and washed the blood off in some muddy lake. Why not make use of one of the dozen bathrooms that must exist inside that castle and take a shower? When he returns home after driving both ways for 16 hours (!) and killing a bunch of guys between the two trips without eating sleeping or anything else he walks in the kitchen where his family is eating supper at this very small table and sits down. The young daughter (who provided the only decent acting in the whole flick) puts an empty plate down in front of him then the son (Peter parker) moves a plate of food from two inches in front of Viggo's plate to two inches beside his plate in an apparent symbolic gesture to show that the kids still loved their pops even though he is a murderous felon. They should have at least been at a bigger table because it looked dumb him moving the plate unnecessarily from two inches in front of him to two inches beside him. Nobody said anything at the table. Why didn't he just say hey or something? Then the  wife and him just stare at each with tears in their eyes. And that's it. There are no spoilers because there's nothing to spoil. Watch this movie if you like to be bored.It was the cheesiest flick ever, with the worst acting ever, the most terrible dialogue ever and extraordinarily amateurish storytelling. There was not a single interesting scene or conversation or worthwhile event or line or anything that would make this respectable. Bad acting, bad writing, bad directing, bad everything. This is the kind of movie that gives Hollywood a bad name. It even had the clueless local Sheriff!!Truly one of the worst movies I have ever watched. Everybody involved in this movie should commit suicide and film it as it would be more interesting and have a better storyline and probably better dialogue than this abortion.

960097,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000CQLZ0Q,A Customer,"[8, 11]","I'm the first to admit that I'm a huge David Cronenberg fan, but I was rather disappointed in A History of Violence. His most acclaimed movie so far, is also perhaps his most tepid. There's no doubt that A History of Violence is a great movie, for about an hour. After that, the movie falls apart due to a lack of drama, and suffers from a pointless and seemingly tacked-on ending.The director does a fabulous job of creating an eerily quiet tone where the audience is on edge waiting for something horrible to happen at any moment, and perfectly films the violent fight scenes so we can see exactly what is happening. He also coaches some astounding performances out of his leads and fills the movie with raw emotion that flies off the screen, whether it is passion, hate or anger. But even Cronenberg can't save the limp second act, and the movie tends to drag, often straining the realms of credibility.Viggo Mortensen stars as Tom Stall - a quiet man running a diner in the small town of Millbrook, Indiana. Tom leads a simple and fulfilling life of a man who is emblematic of the American dream, as he raises his family on a small farm and madly loves his wife, Edie (Maria Bello). But his serene life is shattered when two killers on a crime spree decide to rob Tom's diner late one evening. He shoots the men dead and overnight finds himself a small-town hero, as well as the focus of the national news media.It's this notoriety that attracts the attention of three seriously unsettling shady figures, a crew fronted by the scarred and scary Ed Harris. These new villains seem entirely convinced that they know Tom from the past ... and that ""Tom"" is not even remotely the guy's name. So now this unassuming husband, devoted father, and mild-mannered businessman finds himself swept up into the harsh world of secrets, betrayals, deceptions, and a whole lot of violence.It's a simple story that Cronenberg handles reasonably effectively but his mistake is that he ties up the enigma, the question of who Tom actually is, to early which leaves us wondering how he's going to pad out the rest of the film. Literally, we understand the last half hour, but artistically it is several steps below the wonderfully crafted first hour and it all feels quite anticlimactic and pedestrian.The movie is mostly saved by the performances. Mortensen is absolutely sensational as Tom, the small town, shy, quiet family man who gets caught up in a world of trouble he never could have imagined, but he's smart enough to keep the mystery alive as he plays with his voice and eyes to make us question his past.Maria Bello gives us one of her best performances to date as Edie, Tom's loving, devoted, and gradually desperate wife; she creates a character entirely real and sympathetic. She's gutsy and raw, but also remarkable sexual in nature. It's a brave, fearless performance that also includes, some full frontal nudity.Sadly, William Hurt comes into the movie much too late and in the portion of the film that just doesn't work that well. He's hammy and over the top in a role he never should have taken. The audience in the screening we were at started giggle as he chewed the scenery and displayed one of the worst accents ever on screen; he was suitably creepy but also kind of funny.The critics are, somewhat unjustifiably, having a love affair with A History of Violence, maybe because the simplistic nature of the subject matter makes it Cronenberg's most accessible film, and it deals fairly obviously with the hereditary nature of violence - treating it like a chronic disease; something that can be treated, delayed, and possibly even cured.But as a tale of haunted pasts and borrowed lives, A History of Violence is sadly, Cronenberg's least interesting, settling for some genre set pieces and a pair of eccentric performances by villains, Ed Harris and William Hurt. The director certainly remains a master of creating unease and postulating complicated thematic interests, but with all its violence, the movie is ultimately bloodless, without any real body to it at all.

960099,A34VV92TSLC37R,B000CQLZ0Q,Adam Craig,"[6, 9]","Viggo Mortensen stars as Tom Stall in this psychological thriller from David Cronenberg, the director who brought us the classic chiller Scanners.  Cronenberg has always been known as a ""weird"" filmmaker, but this film seems to levitate him to new levels of oddness.  Tom Stall own's Stall's Diner in Midbrook, Indiana, and he leads a life of peacefulness.  In fact, the only drama going on in the Stall family right now is the son, Jack, having bully problems at school.  That is, until Tom runs into some ""bad men"" one night at the diner, and quickly dispatches of them in a brutal, professional style.  After the unavoidable publicity following this event, Ed Harris rolls into town, saying Tom's real name is Joey Cusack, and harassing the entire Stall family.  Tom denies all links to organized crime back in Philly, but the viewer is left to wonder what is really going on here.I am still on the fence when it comes to Cronenberg's films.  Scanners was a little too odd for me, Rabid was a gruesome, yet interesting film, and The Fly/The Dead Zone seem altogether too normal to warrant any acclaim.  This film, however, seems to set Cronenberg apart from other directors.  You can tell that he completely controlled this movie from beginning to end.  Whether it is the steady, unmoving camera shots that add so much tension, the awkward yet realistic sexuality between Tom and his wife, Edie, or the brutal, unflinching, ultra-realistic violence that is, when inflicted on the viewer, unsettling to say the least.  Cronenberg totally mastered this film.  There is no visible flaw to this movie whatsoever.  The characters are all identifiable, and the dialogue is absolutely amazing.  Particularly the dialogue from Ed Harris and William Hurt.  William Hurt was robbed of an Oscar for this film.  He should have won Best Supporting Actor, no question, but that is another topic for another day.  Even though Harris and Hurt are only in the film for a limited amount of time, they carry the first and second halves of the film, respectively.  Their simple, uncaring attitude towards the vicious acts of violence they participate in creates a very cautionary appearance to the viewer.  The characters are funny, and in Hurt's case, even likable, but you still have to be scared of them because of their power and what they are willing to do with it.A History of Violence is one of my favorite films of 05, and wish it would have gotten a little more recognition at the Oscars, but hey, the Oscars aren't really there to award great movies or actors, they are there so the Hollywood ""insiders"" all have one night to get together and announce their opinions to the known world.If you want to see a well-made film, with a deep meaning that even I'm not sure I totally get, you need to see A History of Violence.

He constantly pushes the boundaries of his filmaking abilities and what he thinks an audience will find ""exceptable."" A History of Violence is an apt subject for him then, with scenes so gutwrenchingly real, in terms of peoples reactions to violence and what happens over the course of the incidents.It's also a study in the very real idea of violence begets more violence. This is never more aptly shown through Tom Stall's son. We see him confronted by a bully twice, both handled differently because of the violence he's witnessing because of his father.Viggo's face is a study of contradictions. We want to believe him, but we're not sure of what to believe. He handles it smoothly, as he does every other role he does, perfectly blending himself with the character. Maria Bello is perfect as his wife. Going, almost always, against what we think her character is going to do. The actor who plays his son is incredible with the role.

960101,AMP7TQRWAIE84,B000CQLZ0Q,"Adrian Cooper ""That Guy from Venus. :D""","[4, 5]","This movie was amazing: The back story, the outstanding characters and their acting, the violence. Nearly everything was gold.I can't fathom the reason why this rating is rather low. The movie had very few flaws if any.Things take place in a small, quiet town where you'd be a fool not to know everyone around you. Everyone's children grow up, and go to school with each other, and they press on as decent citizens just trying to make decent of themselves, settle down and have sex like rabbits do.David Cronenberg's character, Tom Stall is a decent man, making a decent living, running a coffee shop, down the road from his house. He's a great man with a extremely shady past; he used to kill people who didn't agree with him. Putting that in the past, he's made and raised outlandishly great children, and does right by them, up until he smacks his boy for talking back.The movie is NO stranger to violence either. Everyone seems to be after Tom, for his less-than-innocent past, and for good reason. He gives them what they want, WHEN he wants and that's that. Some mobsters come to his diner, scaring his wife s.h.i.t.l.e.s.s., trying to rape an innocent female worker, with nice breasts, and harasses the pants off of everyone. Tom demands that they come to terms, that they are all closed up and the dumbest of them all, says, ""COFFEE!!""If it were my diner, I'd call the cops, to escort this loser out of my diner, and back onto the streets, where they all belong! But no, Tom wimps out, caving in, and giving them what they want, to shut the the F up. I don't blame him personally, and would have handled it much differently, never giving in. But I digress...Tom ends up smashing a coffee pot, right into the guy with a bad, bad eye (Tom barb-wired him up in the past XD), and makes sure these royal asspains don't return.But they do. Once. And they go to his house to retrieve what they want; Tom. He ends up shooting two of the bastards, and his son shoots the one with 1 1/2 eyes. Like father, like son I suppose. Long ago though, Tom had another identity: the name escapes me momentarily, but like I've said, he's done some dark stuff in his yesteryears.The sex scene in this movie later on is super-hot and super-steamy. Tom removes his wife's black panties, and lifts up her black dress. As her thighs yearn for a man strong enough, to be inside of her, she grows anxious, and all the hornier. He finally pulls his faithful, tried-and-true blue jeans down, just below his nice arse, and humps the brains, right out of his attractive wife's head, like nobody's business. Had it lasted another 1 minute or so, I would have seriously had to play a more active role in the situation at hand. =^)Overall, I think this is worth a BUY not a RENT, and you'd be good to watch it as soon as you make this worthy purchase.

Besides, who wants to watch a movie that pretty much has zero surprises? There was NO DOUBT in my mind as to Mortensen's true self, or of what the movie's end result would be. I am sure that the graphic novel which inspired this movie was better as written, since it is hard to imagine a less ingenious plot for a film.Maria Bello was the only actor who delivered a somewhat good performance, although I felt that The director just schlocked together the sex scenes, which could have been made to show the viewer some real humanity. These scenes sort of just appear haphazardly in the movie, and are reduced to mere gratuitous sex / nude scenes by their lack of development - they just aren't credible.For those of you who insist on torturing yourselves with this film, I highly suggest continuing the self-deprecation by watching the 'bonus disc' which has all sorts of goodies. I, myself, laughed out loud at the special 'making of' short about this movie, since the actors and director so obviously think that this film is a 'masterpiece.' It is almost painful to watch this group in self-adoration at the Cannes Film Festival, and I am reminded of the childrens' story - ""The Emperor's New Clothes.""",1,No plot whatsoever! 1 star because I cannot give it a ZERO! *SPOILERS*,1153785600,"07 25, 2006",2006,1600,"['believe', 'everyone', 'entitled', 'own', 'opinion', 'have', 'several', 'thoughts', 'movie', 'would', 'like', 'share', 'fear', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'fall', 'victim', 'rampant', 'abundance', 'false', 'reviews', 'have', 'been', 'posted', 'film.A', 'wonderfully', 'selected', 'cast', 'truly', 'great', 'actors', 'deliver', 'extremely', 'flat', 'uninspired', 'performances', 'plot', 'lacking', 'many', 'areas', 'Besides', 'who', 'watch', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'zero', 'surprises', 'was', 'DOUBT', 'mind', 'Mortensen', 'true', 'self', 'what', 'movie', 'end', 'result', 'would', 'be', 'am', 'sure', 'graphic', 'novel', 'inspired', 'movie', 'was', 'better', 'written', 'hard', 'imagine', 'less', 'ingenious', 'plot', 'film.Maria', 'Bello', 'was', 'only', 'actor', 'who', 'delivered', 'somewhat', 'good', 'performance', 'felt', 'director', 'just', 'schlocked', 'together', 'sex', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'show', 'viewer', 'real', 'humanity', 'scenes', 'sort', 'just', 'appear', 'haphazardly', 'movie', 'are', 'reduced', 'mere', 'gratuitous', 'sex', '/', 'nude', 'scenes', 'lack', 'development', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'credible.For', 'who', 'insist', 'torturing', 'yourselves', 'film', 'highly', 'suggest', 'continuing', 'self-deprecation', 'watching', ""'bonus"", 'disc', 'sorts', 'goodies', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'special', ""'making"", 'short', 'movie', 'actors', 'director', 'so', 'obviously', 'think', 'film', ""'masterpiece"", 'almost', 'painful', 'watch', 'group', 'self-adoration', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'am', 'reminded', 'childrens', 'story', 'Emperor', 'New', 'Clothes']",N/A
960103,A3GI6DS6I474K8,B000CQLZ0Q,"Alan Draven ""Dark Fiction Author""","[2, 3]","Based on the John Wagner and Vince Locke graphic novel. At first glance, A History of Violence appears to be a mainstream action thriller, but if you pay attention, as in all Cronenberg films, it has a few layers underneath its skin.The movie opens with two thugs heading for the small town where Tom Stall (Mortensen) and his family live. The thugs stop by Tom's diner and threaten him and his employees at gunpoint. Tom fights back, killing them both. He becomes a local hero and gets much unwanted attention from the press and TV news crews. His newfound fame also attracts some mean looking men led by Ed Harris's character who believes Tom is somebody he once knew a long time ago. They began harrassing Tom and his family. Is Tom really who he appears to be? How come he's so good at killing people?When I saw this film in theatres, by the time the end credits rolled, I was so psyched that I wanted it to last for another half hour. The build-up to the final confrontation was well crafted.  Viggo Mortensen and Maria Bello had great chemistry on-screen and Mortensen's portrayal of Tom was right on the money. Ed Harris and William Hurt were amazing as usual. Cronenberg's vision made a world of difference in adapting a story that could've easily have left a lot to be desired and gone unnoticed in the hands of a less capable director. He gave it a lot of depth and took the revenge flick one step further, in my opinion.Check out the special features on the DVD for a look at Scene 44, a trademark scene of Croneneberg which he opted to leave out of the film. There's also a 60+ minute documentary plus a few interesting featurettes.

960104,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B000CQLZ0Q,Alex Udvary,"[2, 8]","Before watching this film I saw the recent film ""Capote"". In ""Capote"" he hear him say, when talking about his book, In Cold Blood, that there are two worlds; the quiet conservative one and the criminally violent. If In Cold Blood perfectly depicted those worlds clashing in literature, David Cronenberg's ""A History of Violence"" perfectly captures it in cinema.""A History of Violence"" is placed in a small Indiana town where Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) runs a diner. It's the kind of place where everyone knows your name. We are not in the land of Cronenberg's other films, we are in Leave it to Beaver land. This is one of those small towns where the local residents say, ""here we look out for our own.""One night as Tom is closing the diner two strangers walk into town. In an earlier scene we know they were part of a mass murder. Tom politely tells them it is closing time but the two men do not leave. They demand a cup of coffee. Later the scene turns violent when one of the men pulls out a gun and threatens to kill one of the workers. In that split second Tom acts, and his actions surprise everyone in the town. He kills the two men, making him a local hero.The next day Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris) shows up and claims Tom Stall is not Tom Stall at all. He is in fact Joey Cusack a mobster from back east, Philly to be exact. Tom explains to Carl he clearly has him mistaken for someone else but Carl starts to threaten Tom and his family. And so we are left with the question, who is right? Is Tom really Tom or is Tom really the person Carl claims he is?Cronenberg is exploring a lot in this film. First of all we have a depiction of the duality within ourselves. How seemingly kind gentle people are actually capable of violence. Next we have the small quiet town that isn't so quiet after all. And finally we have Cronenberg's message about how people seem to feel violence is the best way to solve a solution. And I've even heard some people get really politcal and say this movie is an examination of George Bush's foreign policy. I'm not going to touch that issue.One of the reasons I really enjoyed watching this film is because Cronenberg, in some bizarre way, makes the film seem somewhat believeable. The film is tightly crafted where it follows a path of logic and slowly build upon the lead character in a convincing and satisfing way. The big surprise in the film is not whether or not Tom is who he says he is or not, but the effect it has on his family and the way they come to conclude whether it is true or not.One of the most interesting relationships in the film is between father and son. Jack Stall (Ashton Holmes) is a passive kid. He is constantly getting bullied by Bobby Jackson (Kyle Schmid) and one day Jack fights back. Is violence hereditary? What about children from abusive households?Some people may complain the film is too violent. I wonder what planet they are from. Here we have a movie that is called ""A History of Violence"" and is directed by David Cronenberg. Did they honestly think this was going to be the sequel to ""Finding Nemo""? The film's depiction of violence did not bother me in the slightest. And I'd really be surprised if someone told me they found it too gruelsome.I also have to mention how impressed I was with Viggo Mortensen's acting. I didn't care much for him in the ""Lord of the Ring"" movies but here he displays a pretty wide range. It is a tough part to play and he pulls it off nicely. Why he didn't get nominated for an Oscar is beyond me, yet William Hurt did. Anyone else see something wrong with this picture? And Maria Bello as his wife Edie also does a nice job. She shows the conflict a wife must go through when she has doubts about the man she has married. In fact everyone in the picture never goes over the top. Given the setting we are in the film has a sure touch and Cronenberg plays his cards just right. Mortensen, Bello, Harris and the children are all right on. They are fully developed, intriging characters. They are multi-dimensional.One can argue this is Cronenberg's most mainstream effort and maybe it is. But don't look upon that as a fault. The film still retains Cronenberg's twisted and sordid view of life. And just as his other films, ""Spider"", ""Crash"", ""M.

Cronenberg is truly among the greatest directors working today, but AHOV reads like he took a long nap and woke up in the mood to give a lecture.  It would be hard to imagine what the world needs less than another ultra-violent gangster movie, that said, Cronenberg has provided something much more dense and interesting than that.  AHOV works well as a chilling suspense picture, with nice twists.  By today's standards there is not that much on-screen violence, what there is occurs quickly, and it is always essential to the plot - never gratuitous.But the problem with AHOV is the heavy-handed didactic nature; indeed one can picture Cronenberg standing in front of the class.  ""Today's theme is violence and we will be exploring it from the following viewpoints.  (1) What happens when a man's violent past catches up with him?  (2) Is mankind inherently violent?  Is this necessary and even desirable given a Darwinian paradigm?  (3) To what extent is a man's character defined by genetics and experience as opposed to being willed and self-determined?  (4) How many different types of violence can you define in this film? (5) Sarah had sexual encounters with both Tom and Joey, compare and contrast. (6) Tom's son Jack seems to undergo a radical transformation, from wimp to brute.  How does this dramatic duality reflect Tom's situation?""AHOV is exceptionally well made, the pacing is extraordinary, and the way we see Tom/Joey agonize as his personality morphs to and fro is terrific, Viggo Mortenson gives a marvelous performance, as does Heidi Hayes.  But AHOV would have been stronger had it not so obviously carried a tutorial agenda.  Ed Harris, who is always good, is exceptionally good while William Hurt, who is frequently very good, is awful. What others saw in this performance evaded me.  Hurt exudes not one shred of raw personal authority, sadism, or thuggish, lowbrow myopia; any South Philly deli counter man could have surpassed his torpid portrayal.  Overall, AHOV is an excellent film, had it been made by anyone else it would have gotten top rating.

960110,A1ZOF747O5EB6R,B000CQLZ0Q,Andrew Desmond,"[2, 6]","""A History of Violence"" is a thoroughly engrossing film.  The viewer is drawn into a web of intrigue like a moth to a flame.The essence of the story is that Tom Stall is a resident of a small US town called Millbrook in Indiana.  He has a beautiful wife, two kids and runs a small diner in the town.  He is well respected and regarded.  His world, however, is turned upside down when two low life criminals take it upon themselves to rob his business at gun point.  Tom seizes an opportunity and manages to unarm the pair and, in the process, kill them both.  He is hailed as a hero standing up for the small man against crime.It is also at this point that his world becomes even more complex.  Dark figures enter the town after having seen Tom on television.  These figures identify Tom as another man with a less than respectful past.  They know him to be a murderer from Philadelphia with a history of violence.  Tom tries to ignore the claims but is unable to avoid the consequences.  How he deals with this situation covers the balance of the film.The plot is tight and often violent.  The characters are totally believable.  Both Viggo Mortensen as Tom Stall and Maria Bello as his wife deserve accolades.  Ed Harris as the nemesis from Philly is truly unnerving.See this film!

960111,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000CQLZ0Q,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 3]","When I first saw `A History of Violence' it was being toted as one of the best studies of human behavior of the year, and so I was really anxious to experience it.  When the film ended I sat there in odd amazement.  The film opens and closes so spectacularly that I think I was struggling to really identify what my true feelings were on the film.Much like Haneke's `Cache', which was released the same year, `A History of Violence' is a study of how violence relates to human interaction, and how the very idea of the act infiltrates our every action to the point where the lines our blurred and the violence is a part of us.  As a study I find that `A History of Violence' only gets it half right.  In fact, on almost every level I find that this film is teetering on greatness, but never really falling completely over into something truly monumental.  `Cache' is undoubtedly the superior film (it truly manages to be about so much more than you think), but that doesn't mean that `A History of Violence' isn't profound in its own right.  I think that there could have been something truly remarkable here though, and so it irks me a little to know that this has been raved as one of the smartest social commentaries out there, yet it pales in comparison to a film that tackles similar themes that was released in the very same year.The film basically follows a mild mannered man named Tom who owns a diner.  When he foils a robbery and kills some men he gets all kinds of attention, some good and some bad.  The bad comes from a scared face named Carl who claims to know Tom, and his accusations paint Tom to be anything but mild mannered.  The question then arises; does anyone really know who Tom is?As I mentioned, the film opens and closes flawlessly.  The open and close remind me much of Anderson's '07 masterpiece `There Will Be Blood', just in reverse.  Here, the film opens with a sadistic and brutal act of violence and closes with a quiet and defining calm, and much like with `There Will Be Blood', the brutality carries with it a strange calm, while the quiet sequence offers the audience a dread and almost haunting presence.  To say that Cronenberg doesn't completely own this film would be a lie.  My issues with the film do not have anything to do with the open or the close, but with the interior.For me the biggest complaint I have is that the film is not as resounding or as memorable as some make it out to be.  I remember feeling a vague feeling of blandness as I was watching the film the first time, and while it has redeemed itself in some degrees upon recent viewings, the fact still remains that as a film it just doesn't hit as hard as it could.  I love Cronenberg's ability to layer this film with a haunting atmosphere, but that creepy air is really all we are left with when the credits start to roll.  There are also, in my opinion, some odd plot points that don't mesh well with the film and wind up feelings rather awkward.  The side-plot involving Jack, Tom's son, seems like a wasted opportunity to me.  Maybe it was Ashton Holmes' performance, but the whole idea and execution of that point took me out of the film, in a bad way.  I know that it built an important message that the film was trying to get across (about the inheritance of violence), but to me it comes across forced and out of place.I also found William Hurt's hamming it up to be more of a distraction than anything else (and the big reveal feels like a letdown to me).  That ending felt like it was a generic effort to express violence.  I think that is why I appreciated `Cache' so much, and find it to be so much more expressive and poignant, for it found a way to make the travesty of violence accessible and relatable (and all the more shocking and haunting because of it).I could just tell that this film was `trying'.I know it sounds like I'm ripping this apart, and I don't mean to.  There is a lot to really enjoy and or gain from this film too.  I actually found that when the film was concentrating on the relationship between Tom and his wife Edie, it was very powerful and poignant.  In that frame it shifts into a very complex examination of marriage and the tiny seeds of doubt and or concern that can eat at the fibers of that relationship.  I also found that the violence Cronenberg inserts into that marital arrangement (the love making on the stairs for one) were the best examples of violence making an impact in the way Cronenberg desired it to.  Those scenes, for me, say far more about that ambiguity of violence and the instinctual and almost sensual idea of violence than anything else within this film.A lot of people I know rave Mortensen's performance here, stating that he gave one of the best turns of the decade.  I actually found his Oscar nomination turn in `Eastern Promises' to be far better.  For me, Mortensen comes across almost too somber, too controlled, to the point where his character reveal makes little sense.  He handles some of his scenes with a great deal of effective emotional transcendence, but for the most part I found him teetering on bland.  Instead, it was Ed Harris and Maria Bello who completely stole this film for me.  Harris is not an actor I am very fond of.  I often find him to be, well, boring.  Here he really sunk his teeth into the intensity of his character's sinister edge, without every falling into that hammy caricature that Hurt gave us (Oscar nominated the wrong supporting player here).  Bello is a picture of brilliance here.  Her natural gut reaction to her surroundings and the unraveling of her marriage is flawless.  I love the hospital scene especially; the panicked reaction she gives, the vomiting that comes so instinctually and so suddenly.  She really understood how to develop this character, giving her a truly layered and realistic identity.In the end I find that `A History of Violence' is a good film.  I'm giving it a B-.  It definitely has something to offer, and Cronenberg's direction is so inspired and so layered that one has to stare in awe of how well he weaved this films inner dread (the film carries an air of anxiety even when it isn't really progressing).  I just don't think this film is as effective in its efforts as so many critics and fans have claimed it to be.",4,History in retrospect...,1263340800,"01 13, 2010",2010,6280,"['When', 'first', 'saw',

I saw the plethora of one-star reviews and thought ""oh, these are people who don't know Cronenberg and are turned off by the violence.""  To the contrary, most of them are Cronenberg fans who feel like he screwed this one up.  There's some very good criticism about the flatness of the dialog (Viggo Mortensen's Tom Stall is indeed fairly monosyllabic), the gratuitous nudity (I agree with that - the point where that occurred was fairly odd) and, in general, a healthy skepticism about whatever type of 'message' the four- and five-star reviewers see in this work.That aside, I liked - did not love - the film.  Honestly, we watched it as a trial run for the upcoming and very intriguing 'Eastern Promises,' which again features Cronenberg directing Mortensen.  We figured if we could stomach 'Violence,' we'll pay the $9.75 to catch 'Promises' on the big screen.I was happy to see that Maria Bello got a Golden Globe nomination + scooped up some Critic Circle awards.  That's justly deserved.  She's beautiful and spectacular here - she's got to sell the audience on the revulsion she feels when her husband turns out to be not who she thought.  And, wow, does she make that work.  She's the movie's standout.

960115,A2UKC6QFG9L5GV,B000CQLZ0Q,Anton Ilinski,"[7, 11]","First off I'd like to say this movie has little to do with previous Cronenberg's pictures. If you are a die-hard fan of Cronenberg, probably you will be disappointed. But if you try to watch this flick open-minded you'll like it for sure. The first twenty minutes show the idyll of a happy rural family's life. Parents and their two children are joyful, everybody loves each other, nobody yells like it usually happens in families... Everything seems so perfect and unnatural that you even feel the urge to throw up watching this. But then everything changes as Tom (Mortensen) kills two goons who try to rob his cafe. Later Tom appears on TV spoken as of a local hero. Soon he's visited by some don't-mess-with-us kind of guys who think he's a former gangster who once disappeared and have been hiding from them ever since. Who is Tom indeed? We see him as a loving and caring husband and father, perhaps an ideal one for every woman and child. On the other hand, when we see him kill, there's no doubts left that ordinary man is not capable of what Tom just did. Viggo Mortensen showed brilliantly the two sides of his character, I will not be exaggerating saying it's his best work to date.Don't let the title mislead you. It's not history in its general meaning as I first thought when I heard the name. It's history within a man. History of his relationship with violence, which is like a living creature, that can be born in us, can develop and grow up, it can sleep for some time, we may suppress it as well as unleash it. But the point is it exists in every person and we never can finally get rid of it or run away from it.The thing I liked in the film tremendously is that violence here is real violence. Cronenberg doesn't flirt with audience, but shows everything like it is in real life. And real violence is ugly, it doesn't choose whether it's for the right cause or not. Cronenberg's violence is extremely graphic and disturbing, I'm happy he's a man who doesn't care about ratings. And disturbing are not just the violent scenes. If we sum them up they will take only five minutes of the screen-time, I guess. The atmosphere in general is very uneasy, and you'll feel it with every fibre of your skin. And that's what Cronenberg does best - so I may be a little wrong about this picture standing far from his previous works.""History of Violence"" at first may seem a small film, but it's thoughtfull and thought-provoking and good-sized if you know what I mean. Besides it has an excellent cast: except above-mentioned Mortensen we meet Maria Bello, Ed Harris and William Hurt here.

Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[0, 2]","Hearing about this movie, I had thought it was one of the most most violent movies to come out in a long time, and though there are moments of blood and gore, none of them are particularly long or graphic. For me, at least in this movie's case, this was a plus. It added to the surprise of this movie; it's kind of like driving up a hill at a quick speed, cresting it, and driving down it just as quickly. You get that feeling in your stomach that your organs are rising to the top of the neck, and then falling slowly back down to where they are supposed to be. When the violence happens in this movie, you feel the sudden lurch.As for the story, that wasn't so bad, either, but very vague at times, as if it passed over quite a bit of what was in the graphic novel. And the ending cliffhanger wasn't appreciated, at least by me. It follows Tom Stall, a lucky man who has a small business, a beautiful wife, and two children who rely on him as their father. But when two thugs make their way into town and try robbing his diner, he finds himself thrust into the spotlight as a hero. That's when people begin to show up, people who say they know Tom and his history, and though Tom doesn't seem to have any idea what they are talking about, they continue to bother him. Slowly, as Tom and his family gets harassed, the mysteries behind A History of Violence unravels... This movie follows two sides of a plot, and that is Tom's family and his past life, and the two are so starkly different that they collide and little is left behind. It's that strange dynamic that drives this movie from start to finish.As for the DVD, it contains all the norm you would find on other DVDs nowadays. It has a commentary track with the director, a documentary, three short features about the making of the film and all its publicity, and deleted scenes. But to me, they weren't enough to add or take to away from this film, so I won't comment much on them.Still, I will recommend this movie to anyone who likes emotional stories with some surprising moments, such as Hostage or the classic Psycho. The story may be vague at times, but it's still very easy to understand.

960118,A3I389XOSTO0F9,B000CQLZ0Q,"Antonio Palacios ""Gimme music!""","[9, 15]","Tom Stall (Vigo Mortensen) is a family guy who lives an idilic life with his wife and children, you know, the ideal american family. All seems to go perfect. But the life is always far from being perfect. His life changed the day he met the two delincuents we saw in the initial sequence of the movie. He became an hero to the town when he killed the gansters. He tries to return to his normal life but this seems to be imposible when he is visited by two old friends who claim he is another guy who betrayed them in the past.Cronenberg takes the story and make it personal movie. The Tom/Joey duality is worked magistraly. Humans are anturally violent but we can control this violent thoughts and actions in order to life with other people. Stall has chosen to hide his identity and be another person. But the anger still inside. The incident with the gansters has awaken the other-Tom. He can slap his son in the face and almost rape his own wife (in a magistral erotic scene in the stairs) He want to kill his demons, bury the past, return to normal life. After the visit of his old friends to the house the conflict is even more evident. His wife is distant, his sons don't know what to think and the police suspect about his true identity. Tom is alone again.An unexpected call in the middle of the night is the excuse to leave the house and try to fix his life. The final sequences of the movie shows us a Tom determined to expell Joey from his life. After the chatarsis, Tom is a new man, he throws his gun (the sin), washes in the lake (a paralle with the baptism) and return home. His family will be there, waiting. Return to the normality now seems to be so simple: His daughter put his dish on the table, his son approaches him the food and his wife... well, we will never know. To me, this is one of the best scenes in movies and has a lot of meanings. Redemption of man will take place in his house. A simple gesture can fix his life and bring him back to normality.The violence presented in the film is necesary, it has a meaning. Yes, it's a hard movie if you're not accustomed to see the life as it is. There is no happy endings here, all is implicit and you have to think about it and enjoy the movie as it is, an approach to the complex human being.",5,Life is far from being perfect.,1136851200,"01 10, 2006",2006,2267,"['Tom', 'Stall', 'Vigo', 'Mortensen', 'family', 'guy', 'who', 'idilic', 'life', 'wife', 'children', 'know', 'ideal', 'american', 'family', 'go', 'perfect', 'life', 'always', 'far', 'being', 'perfect', 'life', 'changed', 'day', 'met', 'two', 'delincuents', 'saw', 'initial', 'sequence', 'movie', 'became', 'hero', 'town', 'when', 'killed', 'gansters', 'return', 'normal', 'life', 'be', 'imposible', 'when', 'visited', 'two', 'old', 'friends', 'who', 'claim', 'guy', 'who', 'betrayed', 'past.Cronenberg', 'story', 'make', 'personal', 'movie', 'Tom/Joey', 'duality', 'worked', 'magistraly', 'Humans', 'are', 'anturally', 'violent', 'can', 'control', 'violent', 'thoughts', 'actions', 'order', 'life', 'other', 'people', 'Stall', 'chosen', 'hide', 'identity', 'be', 'person', 'anger', 'still', 'inside', 'incident', 'gansters', 'awaken', 'other-Tom', 'can', 'slap', 'son', 'face', 'almost', 'rape', 'own', 'wife', 'magistral', 'erotic', 'scene', 'stairs', 'want', 'kill', 'demons', 'bury', 'past', 'return', 'normal', 'life', 'visit', 'old', 'friends', 'house', 'conflict', 'even', 'more', 'evident', 'wife', 'distant', 'sons', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'think', 'police', 'suspect', 'true', 'identity', 'Tom', 'alone', 'again.An', 'unexpected', 'call', 'middle', 'night', 'excuse', 'leave', 'house', 'try', 'fix', 'life', 'final', 'sequences', 'movie', 'Tom', 'determined', 'expell', 'Joey', 'life', 'chatarsis', 'Tom', 'new', 'man', 'gun', 'sin', 'washes', 'lake', 'paralle', 'baptism', 'return', 'home', 'family', 'will', 'be', 'there', 'waiting', 'Return', 'normality', 'now', 'be', 'so', 'simple', 'daughter', 'put', 'dish', 'table', 'son', 'food', 'wife', 'well', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'one', 'best', 'scenes', 'movies', 'lot', 'meanings', 'Redemption', 'man', 'will', 'take', 'place', 'house', 'simple', 'gesture', 'can', 'fix', 'life', 'bring', 'back', 'normality.The', 'violence', 'presented', 'film', 'necesary', 'meaning', 'Yes', 'hard', 'movie', ""'re"", 'not', 'accustomed', 'see', 'life', 'happy', 'endings', 'here', 'implicit', 'have', 'think', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'approach', 'complex', 'human', 'being']",N/A
960119,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,B000CQLZ0Q,"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[172, 232]","What can I say about David Cronenberg's latest work that hasn't already been said by film critics everywhere? My answer to that has to be: not much. A History of Violence will remind people that David Cronenberg is one of the more underappreciated film directors of the last 30 years and also one of its master craftsmen. Using a loose-adaptation (yet echoing some of the book's themes) of the John Wagner and Vince Locke graphic novel of the same name, Cronenberg creates a multi-layered film dissertation about the nature of violence. I will pause for a moment and say that the film also delivers as a taut, gripping, thriller that looks to ape the action-films of blockbusters past, but Cronenberg's skill as a director manages to keep the film above it's B-movie aspirations.More well-known as the creator of eccentric and unusual fare with legions of fans and admirers in the horror community, David Cronenberg may have his most mainstream and accessible film to date since his remake of The Fly. In A History of Violence Cronenberg's existentialism continues to show as he probes through the dark and shadowy corners of human behavior and instinct. He posits a question of whether people as a whole --- no matter how saintly, well-balanced, and civilized --- secretly revels in the violence they see around them even as they denounce and feel uncomfortable around it. Some have seen this film as something of a historical commentary of the American history and how the nation itself has been shaped by its acceptance of violence and its many repercussions. I would say that those people are not far off the mark, but to compartmentalize Cronenberg's film to such a narrow focus is not fair to the film. Cronenberg deftly shows the brutality of violence and how its effect can be far-reaching and intimite at the same time.As his past films dealt with the horror of the body politic (Shivers, Crash, The Brood, The Fly) and the nature of reality and existence (Videodrome, Dead Ringers, Naked Lunch, Spider, eXistenZ) Cronenberg continues these themes with this film. Despite the gore and viscera being small in comparison to his past works, History still show the carnage and horror that violent acts can perform on the frail human body. The film also points out that people as a whole deceive themselves of the true world around them in order to hold onto the ideal and the quaint. This is really put forward by the dynamic interaction between the character of Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) and his wife Edie (Maria Bello) from beginning to end. It is a testament to the excellent performances by both these actors that the audience truly believe and care for their characters on-screen. I'll have to say that this is Viggo Mortensen and Maria Bello's best work to date and it would be criminal of the industry not to reward them in some way come awards season. The chemistry between these two performers is genuine, searing and very intimate. The very last can be seen in graphic detail in the two scenes of sex between the characters. One in the beginning is naughtily playful and shows how much in love the two characters still are and the second being more brutal and primal as the hidden layers of each character is slowly peeled away to show whats been hidden all along.For an art-film masquerading as an action-thriller, A History of Violence is very deliberate in setting up each violent outburst. There's an underlying dread that permeates through each set-up. We know that something is about to happen, but its not rushed and gradually builds-up until something has to break. The violence is not your stereotypical action sequence that looks staged, but comes and goes quickly with the brutality and lethality of reality. In fact, the violence has the feel of being very intimate. Everything is up close and personal. Nothing is done from a distance and each strike and violent act painful to see, yet in all instances each scene also gets a rousing response from the audience. This is particularly evident in a scene concerning Tom Stall's teenage son dealing with a particular high school bully in brutal fashion. Everyone in this film is touched by violence in some way or another. From the very young to the very old. The final scene at the dinner table is both haunting and familiar. With all that has been going on through Tom's life and that of his family there's a sense of acceptance of the violent genie that was unleashed in the beginning and one of ""life must go on"" mentality.I must say that A History of Violence has to be one of the best films I've seen since I've been watching them. For a film that is really just a revenge-thriller similar to Chan-wook Park's Oldboy, Cronenberg's latest has so many layers and depth to it that anyone who sees it are going to be tempted to talk about its themes and subtext lon after they've left the theater. Where Oldboy is like a hard kick in the gut then a devastation stomp on the neck, A History of Violence is more insidious, intimate and subversive --- like a sharp papercut just beneath the fingernail that lingers and tells one that its going to be there for awhile and there to stay. Some may end up not liking the film due to its deliberate nature or not having enough people dying in elaborately staged action sequences, but that will only show exactly what Cronenberg has been trying to show. That people nowadays have been so inured and desensitized by violence that we've come to accept it as entertainment and actually have come to yearn and need it like a drug-addict looking for their next hit.

The former seems to be unrefined, poorly handled, and ludicrous while the latter is much better done, sharper, and more focused. While the story behind A History of Violence is reasonably good, the acting is quite unconvincing. Ed Harris probably stole the film because he helped to jump-start the momentum since most of A History of Violence is very slow, especially in the first fifteen minutes. Viggo Mortensen's acting looks improved, but he is simply not believable as Crazy Joey. Maria Bello seems to think that getting naked in full exposure is acting and playing the anguished wife is dramatic. There is nothing I see of her that meets the requirement of her character, but she could have easily replaced Sharon Stone in Casino. Ashton Holmes, who plays the teenage son, looks like that he doesn't belong in Stall's family, and Heidi Hayes, who plays the daughter, is the least developed character of the film. William Hurt is overrated for his performance (hell, how many scenes was he in anyway? For how long?); obviously, he did better work during the 80's. Since his remake of The Fly, David Cronenberg has never been the same again. The more recent his movie is, the less David Cronenberg it feels. The same thing goes for A History of Violence; it's just not the same anymore. What made him the best director is the creativity he put in the older psychological horror pictures. A History of Violence actually feels a lot like a remake of Videodrome. Viggo Mortensen is Debbie Harry, and Maria Bello is James Woods. The latter is a newbie while the former is the old-timer; all there to do is create a catalyst and establish a bridge to connect both polarizing opposites. The angry sex scene on stairs is pointless. The tension between Tom Stall and his wife is simply not believable. Do you want me to believe that Tom Stall ran from his town to his house that is probably ten miles away while wearing long sleeves, long pants, stabbed foot, and wrong shoes? And he comes home not really all that sweaty? Believe me, I've run a good deal of my time, and something like that is not remotely possible for a man who is totally out of shape by the looks of his body. There is plenty of violence onscreen, but so? The high school bullying scenes are so 80's.

It was everything an action/thriller is meant to be. The narrative is a sprint. David Cronenberg just straps you in and takes you for a spin through the beautiful roads of a small town in Indiana. There are no pit stops or rest areas. This is not a marathon but a sprint.One of the most beautiful aspects of this movie, is the characterization of the 'bad guys'. Ed Harris and William Hurt play these with an exquisite blend of coldness and creepiness, that has been very rarely been seen on film. Also the shorter length of the movie (96 min) was a refreshing change.Tom Stall is your ideal family man. Great father, great husband and a diner owner who is loved by the people of this small town. The family portrait is disturbed one day when two criminals on a murder spree turn up at Tom Stall's diner. He reacts with alacrity to save his female worker and send these criminals to their fate. With that comes the swarm of TV cameras. And that brings some visitors from out of town. What follows is a peek into Tom Stall's past.Is he the family man that his wife, kids, community and us believe him to be?Warning: It has some serious graphic violence. Not over drawn out gore but authentic depictions of violence which may make you squirm.I should also mention that this movie contains one of the most intense sex scenes seen on film in the recent past.

960127,AR37967IAR6ZT,B000CQLZ0Q,Benjamin,"[7, 12]","The opening minutes of David Cronenberg's film are horrifying, even though the viewer actually sees very little happen onscreen. Two dangerous looking men exit their hotel room, get into their vintage convertible and then creep in it very, very slowly toward the hotel's main office. One of them gets out of the car, goes inside to settle the account, and we wait with the driver outside the office as he gets anxious and a little panicked. Because we've seen the title and because we know what kind of movie to expect from Cronenberg, the whole scene carries an undercurrent of dread. We just wait for the moment of shock, the moment of blood, and Cronenberg relishes in the wait. The opening scene is indicative of the entire film. It builds up long moments of calm so well that viewers are on edge, waiting for the explosion. Everything about main character Tom Stall's life, even his family name, seems to suggest inertia and peace. He has a cozy, happy family. He runs a friendly hometown diner. When a moment of violence interrupts all that, though, Stall's entire history comes into doubt, and the film takes shape as a really bloody, adult drama. Even though the film has thrills, it's about the secret of Tom Stall and how his family comes to cope with that. Though the setting is intentionally idyllic, Viggo Mortensen and Maria Bello invest their scenes of marriage with depth and meaning, showing how a real couple might cope with such startling change.

Admittedly over time the films I one time thought were good -- like The Fly, Naked Lunch, Dead Ringers -- have gotten worse and worse until they are now unwatchable.  I still enjoy the really early films, but I now agree with Robin Wood that his stuff is contemptible and purposefully ugly.  Still, this has gotten good reviews, so I plunked down my money and sat in the theater and -- couldn't believe how bad it was.  From the ridiculously ugly opening sequence with the evil bad guys killing a child to the stupid ""you must be mistaken"" dialogue with Ed Harris to the high school kid suddenly turning into Superman, this was atrociously acted, horribly written, and meanspirited garbage for film buffs.  I swear, I never want to see another movie based on a comic book (graphic novel? give me a break).  This has a comic book mentality, which I guess is supposed to cover all the over the top lapses in intelligence that this film wallows in.  If it's a comic book, why does the violence have to be so bloody and graphic?  David Cronenberg has no respect at all for his audience.  He proudly proclaims he has no responsibility to the audience, but here he proves he has no respect.

Unfortunately, the distributors wish the fate for you. The trailers for the DVD reveled the same spoiler as did my friend and as does the synopsis the DVD packaging. I can't image Cronenberg is a party to this but whether he is or not, I won't be. There will be no spoilers in this review, unlike many others.So, I won't be talking about the plot but rather talk about this in terms of its director, the brilliant David Cronenberg. Cronenberg makes several genres of films, horror; Rabid, Scanners, The Dead Zone, Shivers, etc., metaphysical reality checks; Naked Lunch, The Brood, eXitenZ, Videodrome and the genre that The History of Violence fall into, the psychology of violence. His other efforts in this area are Crash, Spider, Dead Ringers to name a few but History of Violence is the best so far though Spider is my personal favorite.History of Violence is, as the title implies, violent as all get out, so be forewarned. It is emotionally charged, highly sexual and deals with family. Though it has humor to help you digest but at the same time it's a huge, sharp punch in the stomach. It's also flawlessly edited to the perfect length. It's short but epic.Casting, acting, scripting, screenplay, cinematography and direction are all superb. Special mention should be given for Ed Harris' performance and the choice of a slowly cruising black Chrysler 300 to epitomize evil.If you like Cronenberg (maybe you didn't know he made The Dead Zone or Scanners) or if violent, in-your-face movies is your bag or if you're a big Viggio Mortensen fan I would say this is a must-see.

There isn't a large amount of violence in the film, but when it is there, it is very graphic, enough that it shocks you when someone is killed (something most movies are not able to do).  The plot is fairly straight-forward and ""simple"".  But there are subtle meanings and nuances that give the movie more of a punch.

""A History of Violence,"" put mildly, blew me clear out of my chair! David Cronenberg has totally redefined the action genre and shaped it into something all his own.He casts Viggo Mortensen as Tom Stall, a quiet family man and small-town diner owner who quickly becomes a reluctant hero after decisively silencing two would-be thieves. This story soon draws the heated attention of mobster Carl Fogarty who, along with his loyal followers, seems to feel that Tom may somehow be linked to their organization's shady past. As these men begin to methodically encircle Tom's frightened family, tensions rise and personal suspicions skyrocket. Is Tom Stall really the loving, dedicated husband and father he so adamantly professes? Or has his forgotten and abandoned prior life come back to haunt him in ways he could never possibly imagine?Discovering the answers to those two questions are what ultimately makes experiencing this barn-burner of a motion picture so much unapologetic fun! I cannot truthfully remember the last time a movie like this generated so much adrenaline-fueled excitement. The principal performers, between Mortensen, the wonderful Ed Harris, and William Hurt, are all standouts. But the pacing is absolutely phenomenal. This is a movie that very literally flies off the screen. Cronenberg throws so much at you throughout the entire film's 96-minute running time, and yet you're still left hungering for more. The violence is straight-ahead and in-your-face. It more than earns its coveted ""R"" rating.As far as the DVD, itself....you couldn't ask for a better package.

Let me add shallow, jumbled and boring. It is hard, in my case it was impossible, to get involved or to connect with this movie. I'm sorry, but this movie is simply bad. I give it 2 stars because it had Ed Harris in it.  Some of the reviews here on Amazon.com hyping this movie, which seem like they were written by the studio, are pretty far off base in my opinion. I wonder if they watched the same movie I did.I had very high hopes for this movie, but the fact is this movie was simply a big letdown. I have read some who say Cronenberg offends some people, or that this movie is similar to Pulp Fiction and if you don't like that type of movie you will not like this movie either, etc... the fact is, however, I was so bored I would have welcomed the opportunity to be offended.The parts of the movie that feature Ed Harris are the only parts worth watching, but unfortunately, they do not save the movie. The sex and violence scenes are certainly graphic, but I am not sure what they are supposed to accomplish or how they help the movie.

For most, the movie is about the way violence is encoded in our lives and how we all have an underlying current running through us. I think the movie is really the study of the relationship between the two main characters--Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) and Edie (Maria Bello).These two actors are amazing the film, especially Bello, who deserves to become a household name. Their intereactions are always spot on as they drive the plot. The sideways glance, the tense look, the loving smile: every part means something.These two characters are madly in love after seventeen or such years of marriage, and we see it through different ways. The first half of the movie is there to set up their relationship and the love they feel. But then everything is turned upside down, and we realize that these two people who have shared everything and love one another dearly really know nothing about what lies beneath. It's as if they have only shared a part of themselves.It's this interaction and realization that makes the film so great. The plot almost seems beside the point; it's merely there to make use see the characters.I give the film four stars instead of five because of some of the scenes were out of place, almost as if Cronenberg couldn't decide what kind of film to make.

960144,AEVNUEDRGTC4P,B000CQLZ0Q,Charles J. Rector,"[9, 22]","A History of Violence is one of the worst movies of 2005. This is fitting because its director, David Cronenberg, is the single most overrated filmmaker of our times. Whenever an overrated filmmmaker is given a large budget to make a flick, train wrecks like A History of Violence are the logical result.This movie starts with peaceful scenes of a happy family that Cronenberg generally uses to introduce the future victims of the flick's violence to the audience. Of course, in a Cronenberg movie, these scenes are interspersed with other scenes of a nice, calm series of murders in which crooks on the lam kill folks at a motel while exhibiting zero emotion. Of course, the killers and the happy family are obviously on a collision course. If this sequence of scenes were not in this movie, then this would not be a David Cronenberg flick. Cronenberg is basically a hack aka Hollywood creature of habit who always has to make his movies the more or less same exact way.Viggo Mortensen stars as Tom Stall, a restauranteur in a small Indiana town. He is not a native of the town, nor has he been accepted as a fellow townsman by many of the inhabitants. Tom and his family, nevertheless, have managed to have a fairly normal lifestyle. Of course, the bad guys show up and in a predictable bloodbath, Tom vanquishes the evil duo. Tom becomes a local celebrity, but he is traumatized by the whole affair and desperately wishes that it never happened.At this point, A History of Violence was at a crossroads with one path going down the formulaic way of the quick and the easy and the other path pointing towards what for Cronenberg and most other Hollywood types is new, uncharted territory. Naturally, Cronenberg opted for the way of predictable formulas. Even more violence awaits poor Tom and his family.Predictably, the battle-scarred Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris) walks in with a couple of goons and things heats up. Especially after Fogarty asks Tom's wife Edie (Maria Bello) why her husband is so good at killing people. If you have seen previous Cronenberg productions, all this is quite predictable since you will have seen sequences like this time and time again.The remainder of this movie plays out like a standard David Cronenberg formula trash flick. It even features William Hurt as a mobster, even though he is unintentionally ridiculous in that role. Of course, there is a lot of over the top violence that results in collateral damage wrought on Tom's family. The result is just another stupid movie.",1,One of the Worst Movies of 2005,1154044800,"07 28, 2006",2006,2511,"['History', 'Violence', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', '2005', 'fitting', 'director', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'single', 'most', 'overrated', 'filmmaker', 'times', 'Whenever', 'overrated', 'filmmmaker', 'given', 'large', 'budget', 'make', 'flick', 'train', 'wrecks', 'History', 'Violence', 'are', 'logical', 'result.This', 'movie', 'peaceful', 'scenes', 'happy', 'family', 'Cronenberg', 'generally', 'introduce', 'future', 'victims', 'flick', 'violence', 'audience', 'course', 'Cronenberg', 'movie', 'scenes', 'are', 'interspersed', 'other', 'scenes', 'nice', 'calm', 'series', 'murders', 'crooks', 'lam', 'kill', 'folks', 'motel', 'exhibiting', 'zero', 'emotion', 'course', 'killers', 'happy', 'family', 'are', 'obviously', 'collision', 'course', 'sequence', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'movie', 'then', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'flick', 'Cronenberg', 'basically', 'hack', 'aka', 'Hollywood', 'creature', 'habit', 'who', 'always', 'make', 'movies', 'more', 'less', 'same', 'exact', 'way.Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'restauranteur', 'small', 'Indiana', 'town', 'not', 'native', 'town', 'been', 'accepted', 'fellow', 'townsman', 'many', 'inhabitants', 'Tom', 'family', 'nevertheless', 'have', 'managed', 'have', 'fairly', 'normal', 'lifestyle', 'course', 'bad', 'guys', 'show', 'up', 'predictable', 'bloodbath', 'Tom', 'evil', 'duo', 'Tom', 'local', 'celebrity', 'traumatized', 'whole', 'affair', 'desperately', 'never', 'happened.At', 'point', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'was', 'crossroads', 'one', 'path', 'going', 'down', 'formulaic', 'way', 'quick', 'easy', 'other', 'path', 'pointing', 'towards', 'what', 'Cronenberg', 'most', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'types', 'new', 'uncharted', 'territory', 'Naturally', 'Cronenberg', 'opted', 'way', 'predictable', 'formulas', 'Even', 'more', 'violence', 'awaits', 'poor', 'Tom', 'family.Predictably', 'battle-scarred', 'Carl', 'Fogarty', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'walks', 'couple', 'goons', 'things', 'up', 'Especially', 'Fogarty', 'Tom', 'wife', 'Edie', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'why', 'husband', 'so', 'good', 'killing', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'previous', 'Cronenberg', 'productions', 'quite', 'predictable', 'will', 'have', 'seen', 'sequences', 'time', 'time', 'again.The', 'remainder', 'movie', 'out', 'standard', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'formula', 'trash', 'flick', 'even', 'William', 'Hurt', 'mobster', 'even', 'unintentionally', 'ridiculous', 'role', 'course', 'lot', 'top', 'violence', 'results', 'collateral', 'damage', 'wrought', 'Tom', 'family', 'result', 'just', 'stupid', 'movie']",N/A

I guess I was looking for ACTION, but it was more of a DRAMA. I guess I was looking for incredible events, but it was more of a STORY.We've been bombarded with such over-the-top junk in hollywood movies, that when we are given something REAL and gifted with deep emotions, we don't know how to deal with it. My initial reaction was disappointment, but then I realized... how awesome the film really was.Two of the finest and most underrated actors in the world give HISTORY OF VIOLENCE life.Viggo Mortensen (the dudes awesome), plays Tom Stall, a normal, small-town Joe, just trying to trudge through life, provide for his family and forget. So when trouble comes to town and finds his resteraunt, he reacts with swift and violent force. Propelling him into the world of newscast hero, a role, he doesn't want. And soon, even more trouble comes to town, as his story begins to play on newscasts in bigger cities.To town comes Carl Fogarty, played by Ed Harris (my favorite actor, and I think the most underrated actor of all time, GIVE THIS MAN AN OSCAR ALREADY!), a bigtime criminal and he isn't in town for a bake sale.Maria Bello also stars as the wife of Tom, Edie Stall, the source of Tom's passion. The thing that he most cherishes and the thing that most forces his emotions to respond. His passion for her is his driving force and... a little tidbit from the filming process... had to use heavy makeup in their SECOND love scene to cover the BRUISES from their FIRST love scene.I'm not gonna give away the movie, but there are some amazing moments in this film, moments that are anti-hollywood, different, REAL, sudden, shocking, intense and UNFORGETTABLE.In my opinion, A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, is David Cronenberg's finest achievement. A director that is synonymous for giving us such other-worldly, trips into the unreal like THE FLY, eXISTEnZ and NAKED LUNCH, has achieved his best film by giving us something that is very REAL. With real emotions and real passion and real events.What will a man do to perserve his family? To hide his past? To protect the life that he's come to love? You have to see it to know.

960148,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000CQLZ0Q,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 13]","The idea that a movie with graphic depictions of murder could also be deep and incredibly interesting didn't cross my mind until I saw ""A History of Violence."" I understand now why David Cronenberg chose to direct it; his films are nothing if not bizarre and over the top, but they also have an underlying complexity that makes them fascinating to watch. Maybe that's because he chooses stories that focus primarily on the dark recesses of the human mind and the realities they create for the individual. In this sense, ""A History of Violence"" may be one of his darkest films yet, not only because it's disturbingly plausible, but also because it exposes the idea that a happy family life isn't necessarily without its secrets.This movie--based on the graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke--doesn't attempt to reveal violence so much as it proves that it's always existed. And Cronenberg is certainly not afraid to show it in all its quick, brutal, and unfeeling splendor. But I'm using the word ""splendor"" loosely here: despite the fact that violence is quite prominent, this isn't a movie that glorifies it at all. It's simply presented to us in moments of raw imagery, such as in the opening scene when two criminals rob an out-of-the-way motel. We don't see them actually kill (except for one), but we do see the aftermath. You can tell from that scene that it wasn't a case of showing gore just for the sake of being gory. It was dark, it was unnerving, and it was real.And it gets even more real when the setting shifts to a rural, close knit Indiana town. While the filmmakers chose not to delve too deep into the lives of the townsfolk, it's still quite apparent that this is one of those places where everyone knows everyone else's business (something we've seen before in plenty of other movies). That aspect made the film's underlying message more unsettling: however long you may have known your neighbor, friend, or spouse, you never completely know who he or she really is. This is especially true for Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen), who gains sudden notoriety when he saves his diner from being robbed by two desperate criminals. We don't initially analyze how out of place his actions seem because we feel the same way the townsfolk do: we're praising him for his bravery.But then reality starts to sink in. Tom is a mild mannered man living the typical middle class American life, complete with his wife, Edie (Maria Bello), his teenage son, Jack (Ashton Holmes), and his young daughter, Sarah (Heidi Hayes). Why would someone like that know how to kill someone, even in self-defense? This is a question posed by Carl Fogerty (Ed Harris), a mysterious and sinister figure who suddenly arrives with an equally mysterious and sinister group of men. They claim that ""Tom"" is actually a man named Joey Cusack who used to live in Philadelphia. Apparently, he tried to kill Fogerty many years ago. While the truth of that has yet to be revealed, there is evidence of an assault in the form of Fogerty's half blind eye, a grotesquely cloudy mass surrounded by scar tissue (supposedly the weapon of choice was barbed wire).From here on out, it becomes a quest for the truth. Is this just a case of mistaken identity, or is Tom not everything he appears to be? It eventually becomes crucial for an explanation to come forth, as things are starting to unravel. Fogerty won't leave Tom or his family alone, continuously arriving in a new yet menacing shiny black car. What's worse is they resort to threatening Jack, who is having problems of his own in school (there were some incidents with an unjustly hostile bully). Edie starts having doubts about Tom, the man she thought she knew, the man she's loved for many years. All the secrets surrounding her husband's life have turned everyone's lives upside down, and she's clearly struggling to cope with the situation. On top of all that, Tom is eventually forced to meet a ruthless kingpin (William Hurt in his Academy Award nominated cameo) who clearly has an agenda. That scene in particular has Cronenberg effectively showing how human beings react when thrust into extraordinary situations; who would know how to handle such uncertainty? The truth is that no one really knows how to, and that remains one of the film's greatest strengths.The film's ending is a testament to Cronenberg's ability to dissect and observe behaviors and emotions, and he does it with stunning insight. I obviously won't describe the scene, but I will say that it's an interesting unfolding of little moments. It's so interesting that you can't quite put your finger on why it works. It's not really an enlightening scene, but it is an incredibly appropriate one, and it leaves it up to the viewer's imagination as to how future events will unfold for the characters. In other words, it's not one of those endings that tie everything up in a neat little package. We've seen many endings like that, and generally they work. Still, it's refreshing to see a movie that leaves some mystery behind for us to savor, as if to say that sometimes, the answers we're looking for will not be given to us.That's why I think David Cronenberg was the perfect director for ""A History of Violence."" Not only has he been willing to use unconventional storytelling methods, he's also unafraid to tackle subject matter that some may find disturbing. He's certainly never been shy about portrayals of sexuality, which in this case are heavy handed and indelicate (I'm surprised that a couple of very distinct shots made it into an R rated film). Ultimately, the notion of buried truths in the midst of a family life made this a worthwhile experience. It raises important questions and shakes the very foundation of trust. I think we occasionally need to see films like this, if not to entertain us, then to reaffirm that even those we love have strengths and weaknesses.",4,Shoots the Competition Dead,1142985600,"03 22,

A good man living the American dream. One evening two criminals enter the diner to rob it and assault the waitress. Mortensen's mild mannered Tom Stall suddenly leaps into action, knocking one of the men out, grabbing his gun and eventually shooting both of them. Tom becomes a hero and attracts unwanted attention from the national media. Soon a man from the Philadelphia mob shows up claiming Tom is actually Joey, an ex-mobster from the old neighborhood. The rest of the movie explores the question, is Tom Tom or really Joey?A History of Violence is interesting but moves a little too slowly for my taste. It also doesn't delve deeply enough into the mind of a man with a past he's trying to forget. It's all glossed over with no real exploration of his life. There is also a subplot with his teenage son, trying to show that his son may have inherited his father's violent tendencies. However, it all seemed contrived to me and didn't work at all. I didn't believe anything that happened with the son and it all felt tacked on.The performances are good, but the script needed work.

960151,A3JM7ZRLXC18UC,B000CQLZ0Q,Church of The Flaming Sword,"[6, 10]","Before I get to the meat and potatoes of my review, let me make one thing perfectly clear.  I wrote a review for the graphic novel version of _A History of Violence_ last year, and I still find myself pleasantly surprised by all the positive feedback generated by that one review.  It may seem that since I gave the graphic novel a 5-star rating and the film a 4-star that I am picking apart the film for not living up to the graphic novel.  Not quite.  Granted, some comparisons are inevitible.  For instance, the names, places, and even some plot twists have been changed.  Adding to that, the graphic novel is FAR MORE violent than the film adaptation.  But whether you are talking about the film or graphic novel, it's the theme that's important here.  Both operate on the idea that one's actions will always produce consequences that will occur even if the initial actions have long been forgotten.  And when those initial actions are violent, violent consequences are to be expected.  So to make a long story short, I'm going to do the unthinkable.  I'm going to fly in the face of all those fanboys who expect 110% loyalty to the source material by judging the film solely on its own merits.I'm not going to elaborate too much about the plot since so many others before me already did that job, and I did it myself writing the review for the graphic novel - which to my knowledge is still a Spotlight Review for all to see.  At the expense of sounding redundant, we know that Viggo Mortensen (proving there is life after Aragorn) plays Tom Stall, a small town Indiana diner owner turned media sensation who is forced to kill two homicidal robbers who get just a little too familiar with his diner.  And we know that Ed Harris plays Carl Fogarty, a Philadelphia mobster who knows a lot more about Tom than Tom wants us to.  And we further know that Maria Bello plays Tom's wife, who is initially supportive of her husband but understandably cracks under the strain of discovering her marriage, and basically her whole life after she met him, is built up on lies.  There's not much more I can say other than these three do a fine job with these characters.Regarding the film itself, while I did say that I was not going to attack it for not being fully loyal to the graphic novel, I still have to throw in a comparison.  One thing the film actually surpasses the graphic novel in is dealing with the human equation.  We see the strain that Tom's deceit brings upon his family.  We see how his wife finds she can longer trust the man she married.  We see how Tom's son, who is strongly admonished for viciously beating up a bully, views him as a hypocrite.  And then we see the small daughter, who once lived a carefree childhood existence, suddenly thrust into a new arena of distrust and deceit within her family that no child should ever have to see.  These ideas weren't touched upon that much in the graphic novel.So now I'm going to answer the nagging question as to why I gave this film four stars.  For one thing, I did not like the sex scenes.  It is not based on moralism.  I just found the sex scenes overlong and boring.  The typical Spike-TV watching, Maxim-reading male often fast-forwards a film to get the sex scene(s).  Here, I fast-forwarded through them.  My second reason was William Hurt, an actor who is capable of great performances.  But not here.  He is hammier in _AHoV_ than the meat department at Kroger.  He must have been hanging around William Shatner or something.But other than these two flaws, I still recommend this movie.  I hate to keep harping on it, but it is one those rare films that at least stays consistent with, and sometimes even greatly improves upon, the spirit of its source material.  We see too much of how Hollywood Big Money takes a good idea made up by a writer and completely botches it up.  Here they left the central idea alone.

960155,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000CQLZ0Q,"Cloud ""...""","[15, 21]","David Cronenberg always does films that tend to look at human nature in a different way: sexuality in Crash and changes in personality in the Fly. With this film, he gets into what makes people violent and how far it can go, particularly when it comes to saving family members and loved ones. It's a nice exploration but as a film it really left me cold, with highlights being 2 sex scenes and a couple shots of big violence.Tom Stall is a family man with 2 kids leaving in a small town. He runs a local diner which one night attracts some criminal attention, which Tom ends up disposing of rather cleanly. It attracts some more attention, this time from local news and including a strange guy with an even stranger eye and tells him that Tom had a much different life than he does now.While David Lynch likes to make really weird surrealist films, David Cronenberg likes to do films that take a look at transformation and ways people react to things. These 2 will always make interesting movies but I kind of lean towards Cronenberg ones, even though I don't really watch many of them. To me it's a misstep though as the film after it ended didn't really last with me on any level.Casting is quite solid across the board, including William Hurt, who finally puts in some menace into his ""woke up too early"" voice. Viggo is always great although he does have this tendency to mumble sometimes and Maria Bello is always good. Ed Harris is effective as a villain, with a very uneasy feeling you get whenever he's around.As for the violence in the film, it's not incredibly violent. There's a couple of shots that are cringe-inducing such as what happens when you punch someone in the nose a bit too much but it's actually not as violent as you would think.

That is reason enough to see it.The storyline of this mob movie is definitely one that is hard to develop but they do what they can. There are all kinds of moral dilemmas in this show but they are generally exposed & then left unsettled or even ignored. That lowers the quality of the story. As a mob movie though, it is in unusual territory so I'll make allowances for that & get to what is right.Is there hard core violence? checkIs it fast & brutal? checkIs the home life entangled? checkAre the bad guys really bad? checkIs the good guy not very good? checkIs the wife put on the hot seat? checkHow about the kids? Are they confused & conflicted? checkDoes everything work out in the end? Well that's the question & the moviemakers leave it for you to decide but there's just too many things left unanswered by this film for it to get a high rating from me. Too many things that are passed over in the interest of moving the story forward.Yet I'm recommending a viewing because of the talent of the actors. It's seldom you get to see two male support roles filled by the quality of William Hurt & Ed Harris & they are stunning. Viggo Mortensen is way out of his league currently with these two but he puts in a marvelous performance as Tom Stall et al. Maria Bello is- all I can say is to paraphrase a line from Pretty Baby used by Brooke Shields & say, 'I can feel the steam rise up in her right through her dress.' God Bless the cheer leaders of America. Every guy that sees this show will want to be Tom Stall. Ashton Holmes plays Viggo's son, Jack, & should receive notice for the quality of his portrayals also.See it for the acting & see it for the moral ambiguity but I say rent don't buy.  3.5 stars.

But compared to the usual sequels and comic books we get these days its pretty interesting.The story line is nothing more than the ""guy who can't remember where he learned to do that"" used recently in Bourne Identity.  Then comes the innocent guy forced to defend his family which goes back at least as far as Straw Dogs.The problem?  First, Cronenberg just can't make a film about the Johnsons, living at 123 Main Street, Anyplace, USA.  The town looks right but sorry to say, hardly anybody in small town Indiana looks like Viggo Mortensen.  And Maria Bello looks like Kelly McGillis minus 20 pounds.  That's fine in Malibu but in Indiana....Problem #2 is that it isn't possible to accurately portray gun violence and still have an entertaining movie.  So there are brief glimpses of blood and guts but the survivors seem to return to normal functioning almost immediately.That said, the acting is just fabulous.  Everyone is right on the money, with this difficult material.  Think of Tom Cruise defending his family and then watch how Viggo Mortensen does it.  And of course you can't go wrong with Ed Harris and William Hurt.As for the sex scene I think guys will get it.

At the same time, both compelling and disturbing, the film shows the way that violence affects the residents of a small town in the Midwest. Utilizing his sense of irony, as well as his cinematic ability to create suspense, Cronenberg focuses on the characters, their motivations, their actions, and their regrets. He forces viewers to ask themselves what the consequences of violence are and whether or not killing can ever be justified?Tom Stall and his family seem like your typical church-going, honest American family, but all of that changes on one fateful night when two psychotic criminals threaten the patrons of Tom's diner and Tom shoots them both, in self-defense, and kills them. Suddenly Tom finds himself a quasi-celebrity and the dynamic of his family shifts. His wife Edie, his son Jack, and his daughter Sarah become aware that Tom is more than what they thought. Their lives are intruded upon when a group of hitmen from Philadelphia claim that Tom is really a killer named Joey Cusack. Lead by a man named Carl Fogarty, the hitmen target Tom's family and Tom begins to show a paranoid and aggressive dark side that scares his loved ones. After a final confrontation with Fogarty and his men, Tom and his wife's marriage is fractured and their lives are forever altered. Is Tom really Joey, a killer for the mob? And if so, can he find redemption or is he always going to be haunted by this history of violence?The film is certainly Cronenberg's most commercial endeavor and this is in part because of the brilliant cast featuring Viggo Mortensen as Tom Stall, Maria Bello as Edie Stall, Ed Harris as Carl Fogarty, and William Hurt as Richie Cusack.When New Line Cinema released A History of Violence, they advertised it as an action/thriller, which isn't entirely accurate. While the film contains action and is sure to thrill, it's really more of a character study showing the dualism of one man's identity and his attempts to forget his past. It's also a stark reminder of what desperation can drive us to do.Also recommended:Straw DogsDeath WishTaxi DriverThe Bourne Identity(1988 television version)The Films of Michael HanekeRansomMementoRoad to Perdition",4,A Past That's Best Forgotten,1225843200,"11 5, 2008",2008,2424,"['WARNING', 'film', 'strong', 'brutal', 'violence', 'graphic', 'sexuality/nudity', 'explicit', 'language', 'brief', 'drug', 'film', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'director', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'VideodromeandCrash', 'America', 'fascination', 'violence', 'same', 'time', 'compelling', 'disturbing', 'film', 'way', 'violence', 'residents', 'small', 'town', 'Midwest', 'Utilizing', 'sense', 'irony', 'as', 'well', 'cinematic', 'ability', 'create', 'suspense', 'Cronenberg', 'characters', 'motivations', 'actions', 'regrets', 'viewers', 'ask', 'what', 'consequences', 'violence', 'are', 'not', 'killing', 'can', 'ever', 'be', 'justified', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'family', 'seem', 'typical', 'church-going', 'honest', 'American', 'family', 'changes', 'one', 'fateful', 'night', 'when', 'two', 'psychotic', 'criminals', 'threaten', 'patrons', 'Tom', 'diner', 'Tom', 'shoots', 'self-defense', 'Suddenly', 'Tom', 'quasi-celebrity', 'dynamic', 'family', 'shifts', 'wife', 'Edie', 'son', 'Jack', 'daughter', 'Sarah', 'become', 'aware', 'Tom', 'more', 'what', 'thought', 'lives', 'are', 'intruded', 'when', 'group', 'hitmen', 'Philadelphia', 'claim', 'Tom', 'really', 'killer', 'named', 'Joey', 'Cusack', 'Lead', 'man', 'named', 'Carl', 'Fogarty', 'hitmen', 'target', 'Tom', 'family', 'Tom', 'show', 'paranoid', 'aggressive', 'dark', 'side', 'loved', 'ones', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Fogarty', 'men', 'Tom', 'wife', 'marriage', 'fractured', 'lives', 'are', 'forever', 'altered', 'Tom', 'really', 'Joey', 'killer', 'mob', 'so', 'can', 'find', 'redemption', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'haunted', 'history', 'violence', 'film', 'certainly', 'Cronenberg', 'most', 'commercial', 'endeavor', 'part', 'brilliant', 'cast', 'featuring', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'Edie', 'Stall', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Carl', 'Fogarty', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Richie', 'Cusack.When', 'New', 'Line', 'Cinema', 'released', 'History', 'Violence', 'advertised', 'action/thriller', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'accurate', 'film', 'action', 'sure', 'thrill', 'really', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'showing', 'dualism', 'one', 'man', 'identity', 'attempts', 'forget', 'past', 'also', 'stark', 'reminder', 'what', 'desperation', 'can', 'drive', 'do.Also', 'recommended', 'Straw', 'DogsDeath', 'WishTaxi', 'DriverThe', 'Bourne', 'Identity', '1988', 'television', 'version', 'Films', 'Michael', 'HanekeRansomMementoRoad', 'Perdition']",N/A

Is that a surprise?  'Cause, guess what kids: if that were REALLY true -- REALLY REALLY true -- as soon as the Ed Harris dude shows up (the one with the scratched-out eye & scar across his face, which ""reminds"" him of the main character), one wouldn't really get much time to hang around afterwards.  He could B.S. his way through the first convo -- sure, fine -- and then dash home to get his family out of town, go on the run, explain it to wifey & son later ...WAIT A MINUTE: That's NOT what he does, does he?NO!No, apparently, we -- the viewers -- are supposed to swallow that he'd just hang around -- new haircut, and all -- and figured ... like, what?  The mob guys would get so tired of his constant evasiveness (""No ... REALLY guys!  I'm REALLY someone else entirely!  Honest!""), that they'd lose interest, out of irritation, and drive ALL THE WAY BACK across the county to Pennsylvania with a ""Well, I guess that WASN'T him after all!"" sort-of attitude?Um ... nah.  Not so much.  There's, like, NO WAY that would've happened -- and there's NO WAY the Viggo Mortensen character couldn't have, uh, KNOWN that -- so ... what do we get, instead?A bit of ""narrative sleight-of-hand"" -- the hinge of the premise, the title, & the ""big truth"" of the film -- flying in the face of all ""traceable,"" outside-the-film logic.[SPOILER ALERT #2]:  Killing someone with a shotgun -- especially if you're a teenager (from a sheltered, suburban upbringing, no less) -- does NOT make you a ""samurai warrior,"" or even an ""angry, violent-type"" fighter: it's a TRAUMA!The kid would've needed COUNSELING -- or, more specifically, exhibited the sort of behavior that would lead people to recommend counseling -- because pulling the trigger and experiencing the viscera/energy-loss/psychic-""maxing out"" of taking a human life would leave him in NO OTHER state.(This, in a sense, gets at what I find most disingenuous about this film: the way it plays with genre conventions & art-film ""truths"" willy-nilly, whenever it feels like it.  Clearly, the teen son ""saves"" his father in a ""cliffhanger"" fashion -- we won't go into how his dad manages to overpower & outwit everyone but the mob boss character, since this is a Sylvester Stallone film, and we expect that ... er, wait ... WHAT was the premise of this film again?)Right.  ""Deep truths.""  Of course!SO: the kid goes to school, and ... overpowers two (2) jock ""bully"" types, because ... the diegesis (& David Cronenberg, the screenwriter) see fit to reveal this as a ""life truth""?Hmm ... no.No, because fighting's like anything else that requires experience: on top of the fact that the kid would likely be home from school that day, anyway -- suffering night tremors, horrific nightmares, vomiting, etc. (and, what: I'M being ""melodramatic""?) -- he's able to ""best"" two (2) opponents who -- jerks though they are, and limited though their ""arsenal"" of approaches may be -- pound other guys faces on a semi-regular basis?Right.  Sure.No problem ... for a ""Die Hard"" movie![SPOLIER ALERT #3]: Ultimately, this is point #1 ""brought home,"" to the denouement of the film: leaving aside the fact that no-one in the mob would, ludicrously, try to kill someone lured into a we-have-all-the-advantage trap with as outmoded and troublesome a method as strangulation with piano wire (???) -- allowing the Viggo Mortensen character to ""escape,"" while the audience rolls their eyes & the William Hurt character makes a weird, semi-ironic joke about ""f***[ing] that up,"" (which is sort of lost in the shuffle, given that, obviously, the screenwriter painted the characters into that particular corner; which are we supposed to ""believe""?) -- besting all the adversaries (again: ACTION MOVIE realism!) hardly means the father has ""escaped"" these folks ...

960163,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B000CQLZ0Q,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[3, 3]","This is not a pleasant film.  It is about the nature of violence and how humans are forced into violence and its consequences.  Master of visceral angst, David Cronenberg, tackles the subject of the present haunted by the past in small town America in A History of Violence.  Although its subject matter is disturbing and the visuals are unnerving, it boasts some of the best acting in any film this year and is the most accomplished of Cronenberg's cinematic canon.Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) is a family man who runs a quiet diner in a small town and has the idyllic life of husband to a beautiful, loving wife, Edie (Maria Bello), and father to an adolescent son, Jack (Ashton Holmes), and younger daughter, Sarah (Heidi Hayes).  One fateful day a pair of serial criminals barges into the diner looking for trouble in the worst way, and Tom must protect his patrons and staff.  What transpires is a remarkable display of self defense and marksmanship as Tom becomes a local hero for his bravery.  Soon after, a mysterious, black car begins to stalk Tom and his family at his diner and home.  A hardened looking man named Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris) approaches Tom.  It seems Tom's notoriety in the media has attracted Fogarty's attention leading him to believe Tom is not who he appears to be but rather a man named Joey with a very dark, violent past.  Years ago, this Joey had run from the mob after causing a lot of trouble and mutilating one of Fogarty's eyes.  The uneasy tension bubbles over when Fogarty and his men confront Tom at his home as his family watches in terror.  What happens then and afterwards leads to traumatic discovery and the reevaluation of relationships that culminates full circle at a mobster's mansion in Philadelphia.Adapted by Josh Olson from the graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke, director Cronenberg displays a sure hand in his scenes of conflict whether they are emotional or violent.  How ironic that the Canadian born director comments on the violence in the U.S.  He does a nice job of setting up the scenes and characters methodically as we first see a loving family amid an innocent town. Subsequently, an ominous atmosphere of foreboding hangs over the rest of the film.  There are some terrific set pieces that culminate in startling violence, and the confrontation at Tom's house is quite memorable and results in a moment of truth.  Let it be said that the violence is organic.  It grows out of necessity and is carried out brutally and swiftly.  The scenes have a lingering trauma on the characters and the audience.  The visuals are stark and powerful by cinematographer Peter Suschitzky with a brooding score by Howard Shore (ironically a veteran scorer of previous Cronenberg films and Mortensen's Lord of the Rings trilogy). In fact the film, with its small, peaceful town contrasted with an evil menace, feels like a David Lynch film, and is thematically very much akin to Blue Velvet or Twin Peaks.Ed Harris makes a grand entrance early on and he grabs this juicy role and never lets go.  It is certainly one of his finest performances.  William Hurt makes you realize just how talented an actor he is in the relatively short but brilliant turn as a mobster from the past with an agenda.  But it is lead actor Viggo Mortensen who shines as the reluctant hero.  He balances just the right amount of paradoxical innocence and cunning.  He is a man about to peer over the precipice and lose everything he has.  His brooding, quiet but strong avenger is constantly riveting.  Maria Bello is quite touching as the affected wife and mother who is confronted by fear and uncertainty.  Even Stephen McHattie registers strongly as one of the baddies (very reminiscent of the scum in Natural Born Killers) at the beginning.Some directors are accused of making movies of interminable length.  Not so with Cronenberg as he may be accused of being too economic and concise.  While the pacing is tightly edited for maximum impact, some relationships needed to be fleshed out more. During the course of the story, there are two graphic displays of sex between Tom and Edie (one playful and the other angry) which serve as emotional counterpoints to their relationship. We need to understand what is going on in Edie's mind and how she faces the future with her family.  While there is a promising development of the early bonding between Tom and his introverted son Jack, we want more exposition of Jack as he goes from harassed school kid to a coming of age.  We just needed a bit more character development, but what we do have is pretty thought provoking and unforgettable.  The final scene is memorable.A far cry from his notorious horror films, this film delves into the true nature of self and identity.  This is Cronenberg's most accessible film since The Fly and The Dead Zone.  While his early horror films like Scanners and Videodrome dealt with physical transformation, this film deals with metaphysical transformation.  He comes dangerously close to his earlier, notorious cult film, Crash (not to be confused with Paul Haggis' current film), another film about human behavior dealing with psychological change. His films often deal with ugly, sordid truths and secrets that lie beneath what is perceived superficially.  A fascinating study and exploration of human behavior under the most extreme duress, A History of Violence is an intelligent, brutal gem of a film not for all tastes, but for those willing to peer on the other side of sanity and complacency, it's a dark slice of unsavory life.",4,A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE Disturbs the Senses,1129075200,"10 12, 2005",2005,5558,"['not', 'pleasant', 'film', 'nature',

960166,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B000CQLZ0Q,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[0, 4]","David Cronenberg paints a dark and disturbing picture, a deep and meaningful look at human nature and the parts of us that we wish weren't there.  'A History of Violence' is the story of Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen), a laid back family man living a normal life working at his family run diner.  He has a loving wife Edie (Maria Bello in a brilliant oscar ROBBED role) and two kids.  He has a normal life, and he likes it that way.  His 'normal' life is disrupted when two thugs try and rob him.  When the robbery goes a bust and the thugs try and murder one of Tom's employees Tom, in an act of bravery (and instinct) kills the two men and becomes the town hero.  Hero has a nice ring to it, but when it brings with it unwanted attention, and not just media attention, then 'hero' is not what you want to be.  When a man by the name of Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris) shows up at Tom's diner and accuses him of being a man by the name of Joey Cusack things start to change for Tom.  You can sense some truth in Carl's voice and some terror in Tom's eyes.  (I just want to say now that Viggo Mortensen, while not one of my favorite actors, does a GREAT job of acting with his eyes throughout this film, subtly doing SO much with just his stare.)  Even though Tom denies everything questions are still raised as to the truth behind what Carl has said, and as Carl continues to harass the Stall family those questions eventually answer themselves and Edie begins to see the man that her husband really is, the man that her husband kept hidden for so long.  On surface level this film seems standard, seems 'been-there-done-that' but it's quite the opposite.  'A History of Violence' is more about our inner person and our inbred traits then about 'violence'.  It's about the inability to change who we are just because we want to and the fact that somethings we're born with (as is seen in the way Tom's son Jack decides to deal with the school bully).  The final confrontation between Tom and his brother, kingpin Richie Cusack (William Hurt in his brilliant oscar nominated role) explains the backstory for the viewer but also sheds some light on who Tom/Joey really is...what type of man he is, errr, was.  This film is a great charactor study and a movie that should be watched, and as some have suggested, studied.  What makes this movie by far is the acting, especially on the part of Maria Bello who blew me away with her brilliant performance.  Just watch the seen in the hospital when she finds out the truth about her husband.  Her movements, her words, everything is so sudden and tense you'd swear she wasn't acting.  This is by no mean the 'best' film of 2005 but it is worthy of all it's praise and is deffinitly top 10!",5,"""Tom is who he says he is.""",1147219200,"05 10, 2006",2006,2723,"['David', 'Cronenberg', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'picture', 'deep', 'meaningful', 'look', 'human', 'nature', 'parts', 'wish', 'were', ""n't"", 'there', 'History', 'Violence', 'story', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'laid', 'back', 'family', 'man', 'living', 'normal', 'life', 'working', 'family', 'run', 'diner', 'loving', 'wife', 'Edie', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'brilliant', 'oscar', 'ROBBED', 'role', 'two', 'kids', 'normal', 'life', 'way', ""'normal"", 'life', 'disrupted', 'when', 'two', 'thugs', 'try', 'rob', 'When', 'robbery', 'bust', 'thugs', 'try', 'murder', 'one', 'Tom', 'employees', 'Tom', 'act', 'bravery', 'instinct', 'two', 'men', 'town', 'hero', 'Hero', 'nice', 'ring', 'when', 'unwanted', 'attention', 'not', 'just', 'media', 'attention', 'then', 'not', 'what', 'want', 'be', 'When', 'man', 'name', 'Carl', 'Fogarty', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'up', 'Tom', 'diner', 'being', 'man', 'name', 'Joey', 'Cusack', 'things', 'start', 'change', 'Tom', 'can', 'sense', 'truth', 'Carl', 'voice', 'terror', 'Tom', 'eyes', 'just', 'want', 'say', 'now', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'not', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'GREAT', 'job', 'acting', 'eyes', 'film', 'subtly', 'doing', 'SO', 'much', 'just', 'stare', 'Even', 'Tom', 'everything', 'questions', 'are', 'still', 'raised', 'truth', 'what', 'Carl', 'said', 'Carl', 'harass', 'Stall', 'family', 'questions', 'eventually', 'answer', 'Edie', 'see', 'man', 'husband', 'really', 'man', 'husband', 'kept', 'hidden', 'so', 'long', 'surface', 'level', 'film', 'standard', ""'been-there-done-that"", 'quite', 'opposite', 'History', 'Violence', 'more', 'inner', 'person', 'inbred', 'traits', 'then', ""'violence"", 'inability', 'change', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'want', 'fact', ""'re"", 'born', 'seen', 'way', 'Tom', 'son', 'Jack', 'deal', 'school', 'bully', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Tom', 'brother', 'kingpin', 'Richie', 'Cusack', 'William', 'Hurt', 'brilliant', 'oscar', 'nominated', 'role', 'backstory', 'viewer', 'also', 'light', 'who', 'Tom/Joey', 'really', 'what', 'type', 'man', 'errr', 'was', 'film', 'great', 'charactor', 'study', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'have', 'suggested', 'studied', 'What', 'movie', 'far', 'acting', 'especially', 'part', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'who', 'blew', 'away', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Just', 'watch', 'seen', 'hospital', 'when', 'out', 'truth', 'husband', 'movements', 'words', 'everything', 'so', 'sudden', 'tense', ""'d"", 'swear', 'was', ""n't"", 'acting', 'mean', ""'best"", 'film', '2005', 'worthy', 'praise', 'deffinitly', 'top', '10']",N/A

Our myths, our religions, our fiction, and are non-fiction are paved with violence.  From a simple game of dodge ball the ongoing war in Iraq our lives are filled with violence.  David Cronenberg's A History of Violence is a tale of a simple act of heroic violence and how even if you don't plan on ""living by the sword"" sometimes the sword is thrown into your lap.Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) has a simple life.  He owns a diner in a tiny little Indiana town.  There he makes sandwiches, slings burgers, pours coffee, and make a darn fine piece of pie.  He has a beautiful family, his wife (Maria Bello) adores him, his son looks up to him, and his daughter is just so darn precocious.  His world is rocked when two men try to violently rob the diner.  Tom shoots to kill, setting up a series of events that will shake him and his families life forever.A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE is one of those movies that tries to turn  the familiar thriller on its head.  It succeeds sometimes and at other times it clunks along offering very few questions as to why things are happening.  When the film finally reveals itself, your left holding a bag of half thought out ideas, and performances that aren't quite believable enough to add up to a film worth spending your hard earned time and energy on.Mortensen and Bello carry the film.  It's a tough job and you can tell both actors are trying really hard to save it.  Unfortunately Mortensen is given a character that has no real life.  He just floats in and out of reality, and when all is said and done I wasn't sure if his Tom could be who he says he is.  The final act puts him in a house with John Hurt.  The scene is so stilted it's as of Cronenberg told Mortensen to back off.  It's Hurt's time to shine.  Hurt mugs to the camera creating a character who is all performance and no life.As for Bello she's asked to pull her character through some even bigger hurdles.  But again the material she's given leaves no room for subtlety.  So you watch as this character runs the gamut of emotions for what?  I'm not really sure.  One minute she's big and brash the next she's sullen.  Some better motivation would have lifted her performance out of the gutter.  But alas she's good, just not that good.A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE is another head scratching question asking ride that will have you leaving the theater ready for a night of discussion.  But at the end of the road you'll probably find that there was nothing profound to learn from it, and you won't really be entertained by it.

960170,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B000CQLZ0Q,David A. Wend,"[0, 0]","The story of ""A History of Violence"" is quite simple: a professional killer, fleeing his past, becomes a family man to have his identity discovered when he kills in self defense.  When we first meet him, Tom Stall is the owner of a diner in a small Indiana town carrying out a daily routine of work and family.  An interesting part of the story involves Tom's teenage son Jack who is being harassed by a bully at school.  Like Tom, he keeps a mind mannered demeanor until pushed too far when he puts the bully in the hospital.  Tom admonishes his son for what he has done but soon his own violent past (by all accounts a sadistic past) intrudes.Viggo Mortensen gives a measured performance as Tom Stall.  He is very ordinary as he pursues the routines of his life.  Maria Bello is very good as his wife Edie; they make a good couple, and are very much in love.  The children were well cast and played: Ashton Holmes is very good as the teenage Jack who looses the father that he knew and Heidi Hays is equally good as Tom and Edie's young daughter.  She has a pivotal role in the last scene of the film that indicates to us as to whether Tom will be able to resume his Ed Harris is excellent as usual and unforgettable as Carl Fogarty, disfigured by Tom Stall in his former life as Joey Cusack and looking for revenge.  He generates a feeling of menace just by being in a scene.  It was interesting to see William Hurt in his cameo as Tom/Joey's ruthless brother.  He has only one scene but that one is played beautifully as Hurt's Richie Cusack muses about how his brother could become such an unheard of think as a family man, going on to tell Joey how much he has cost him over the years.My wife thought that the film started a little on the slow side but I think it is important to establish Tom Stall's solid, if boring,  family life.  Once the violence begins - and it is a graphic film - the pace is unrelenting.  Beyond the violence, however, are the questions the film raises about the violence of our society and even though we know it is wrong people fall into it willingly and unwillingly.  For Tom Stall aka Joey, even though he has renounced his violent past it is so much a part of him that he acts from pure instinct.  I think that I will never forget the final scene in the film, set to wonderfully brooding music by Howard Shore, when Tom returns home and is reluctant to enter the kitchen where his family is having dinner.  You can read the uncertainty in all of the faces - Edie, Jack and Tom.  It is his young daughter who settles the issue of ""inviting""  Tom in, to be a family again. We all know that things will not be the same but all of them need each other.  So, David Chroenburg has given us a thought provoking story offering many perspectives on the workings of violence.",5,A Thought Provoking Film,1128902400,"10 10, 2005",2005,2802,"['story', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'quite', 'simple', 'professional', 'killer', 'fleeing', 'past', 'family', 'man', 'have', 'identity', 'discovered', 'when', 'self', 'defense', 'When', 'first', 'meet', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'owner', 'diner', 'small', 'Indiana', 'town', 'carrying', 'out', 'daily', 'routine', 'work', 'family', 'interesting', 'part', 'story', 'Tom', 'teenage', 'son', 'Jack', 'who', 'being', 'harassed', 'bully', 'school', 'Tom', 'mind', 'mannered', 'demeanor', 'pushed', 'too', 'far', 'when', 'bully', 'hospital', 'Tom', 'son', 'what', 'done', 'soon', 'own', 'violent', 'accounts', 'sadistic', 'past', 'intrudes.Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'measured', 'performance', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'very', 'ordinary', 'routines', 'life', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'very', 'good', 'wife', 'Edie', 'make', 'good', 'couple', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'children', 'were', 'well', 'cast', 'played', 'Ashton', 'Holmes', 'very', 'good', 'teenage', 'Jack', 'who', 'father', 'knew', 'Heidi', 'Hays', 'equally', 'good', 'Tom', 'Edie', 'young', 'daughter', 'pivotal', 'role', 'last', 'scene', 'film', 'Tom', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'resume', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'excellent', 'usual', 'unforgettable', 'Carl', 'Fogarty', 'disfigured', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'former', 'life', 'Joey', 'Cusack', 'looking', 'revenge', 'feeling', 'menace', 'just', 'being', 'scene', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'William', 'Hurt', 'cameo', 'Tom/Joey', 'ruthless', 'brother', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'one', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Hurt', 'Richie', 'Cusack', 'how', 'brother', 'could', 'become', 'such', 'unheard', 'think', 'family', 'man', 'going', 'tell', 'Joey', 'how', 'much', 'cost', 'years.My', 'wife', 'thought', 'film', 'started', 'little', 'slow', 'side', 'think', 'important', 'establish', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'solid', 'boring', 'family', 'life', 'violence', 'graphic', 'film', 'pace', 'unrelenting', 'violence', 'however', 'are', 'questions', 'film', 'violence', 'society', 'even', 'know', 'wrong', 'people', 'fall', 'willingly', 'unwillingly', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'aka', 'Joey', 'even', 'renounced', 'violent', 'so', 'much', 'part', 'pure', 'instinct', 'think', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'final', 'scene', 'film', 'set', 'wonderfully', 'brooding', 'music', 'Howard', 'Shore', 'when', 'Tom', 'home', 'reluctant', 'enter', 'kitchen', 'where', 'family', 'having', 'dinner', 'can', 'read', 'uncertainty', 'Edie', 'Jack', 'Tom', 'young', 'daughter', 'who', 'issue', 'inviting', 'Tom', 'be', 'family', 'again', 'know', 'things', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'same', 'need', 'other', 'So', 'David', 'Chroenburg', 'given', 'thought', 'provoking', 'story', 'offering', 'many', 'perspectives', 'workings', 'violence']",N/A

Tom Stall (Viggo Mortenson) is the owner of a small-town cafe who has a very dark and violent past that he has managed to bury deep inside himself.  The attempted robbery of his diner by a pair of sociopaths triggers a series of events that will force Tom and his family to come to grips with his past and his hidden nature.Cronenberg's specialty as a filmmaker is couching serious, fascinating questions about the nature of personality and perception within compelling, violent narratives, and he is in top form here.  How much control can we really exercise over our basic natures?  To what extent are we ruled by our genetic wiring and to what extent can we consciously choose the kind of person we want to be?  Did Tom earn his idyllic small town existence by having the strength to change, or is it just that he be punished with the consequences of his former life?

960174,A2Q42ON9CEHR4O,B000CQLZ0Q,David R. Eastwood,"[2, 5]","David-and-Goliath fantasies have been a part of many people's daydreams since, well, since at least the times of David and Goliath, and very long ago, authors of all sorts discovered there was an eager market for such stories. In our own times, in the early 1970s, David Carradine starred in a TV series called ""Kung Fu,"" playing the sort of quiet, unassuming, peace-loving fellow that bullies love to beat up. Week after week, viewers were treated to the spectacle of bullies (often criminal bullies) getting the crap kicked out of them when they foolishly tried to mess with THIS guy. It made no difference if they were armed with knives or guns and in groups of five or ten or even twenty--the bullies never had a chance. From the early1980s to the mid-'90s, a series of KARATE KID movies starring Pat Morita had similar fantasy plots: nobody, no group, regardless of their weapons or their skills, had better mess with elderly little Mr. Miyagi--or his pupils.A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE combines this sort of heroic fantasy with some erotic fantasies in a fairly satisfying way. Viggo Mortensen (best known as Strider/Aragorn in THE LORD OF THE RINGS) here plays a quiet fellow who runs a diner and who, to our delight, efficiently disposes of a series of tough guys who are trying to kill him. Elements of mystery are stirred in (who is he really? what sort of past has he had?), and depth is added by having his wife and son struggle to accept the hidden facets of him that suddenly appear.Ed Harris and William Hurt are excellent as the chief villains, and Maria Bello is wonderful as the hero's intelligent and sexy wife. The action scenes, both violent and erotic, are skillfully choreographed, including a fight that the hero's son has with bullies in high school.The special features on the DVD include some interesting commentary. There we can discover that the film's director, David Cronenberg, is at least partly sending a kind of message--which many viewers probably missed: he wished to make us a bit more aware of our divided feelings about using violence as a solution to our own problems, whether as individuals or as a nation. Just as Mortensen's character has ""a history of violence"" (as a prosecuter might say), many of us--including many of our leaders--have a long-term preference for the use of force rather than other solutions. My own impression is that this message was an afterthought and was not fully incorporated into the plot of the film.Considered chiefly as a fulfillment to our David-and-Goliath fantasy needs, this film has one major plot weakness that could easily have been corrected: we never learn how, when, where, or why Mortensen's character acquired his superior martial-arts skills. His ""moves"" are clearly not things that he would have been picked up in bar fights or street fights. Imagine the KILL BILL movies with such a plot-gap: the audience HAS to know where Uma Thurman, Daryl Hannah, David Carradine, and many of the rest learned to fight so well. Even in ""Kung Fu,"" we got many flashbacks to the Shaolin temple where Carradine's character got his training, and in the KARATE KID films we found out that Pat Morita's character was taught karate by his father on Okinawa.If you would like to watch a 5-star heroic underdog fantasy, buy, borrow, or rent BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK, a 1955 film in which Spencer Tracy plays a one-armed WWII veteran who ""takes out the trash""--um, single handedly.",4,HEROIC FANTASY WITH (PERHAPS) A HIDDEN MESSAGE,1146355200,"04 30, 2006",2006,3439,"['David-and-Goliath', 'fantasies', 'have', 'been', 'part', 'many', 'people', 'daydreams', 'well', 'least', 'times', 'David', 'Goliath', 'very', 'long', 'ago', 'authors', 'sorts', 'discovered', 'was', 'eager', 'market', 'such', 'stories', 'own', 'times', 'early', '1970s', 'David', 'Carradine', 'starred', 'TV', 'series', 'called', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'playing', 'sort', 'quiet', 'unassuming', 'peace-loving', 'fellow', 'love', 'beat', 'up', 'Week', 'week', 'viewers', 'were', 'treated', 'spectacle', 'bullies', 'often', 'criminal', 'bullies', 'getting', 'crap', 'kicked', 'when', 'foolishly', 'tried', 'mess', 'THIS', 'guy', 'made', 'difference', 'were', 'armed', 'knives', 'guns', 'groups', 'five', 'ten', 'even', 'twenty', 'bullies', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'early1980s', ""mid-'90s"", 'series', 'KARATE', 'KID', 'movies', 'starring', 'Pat', 'Morita', 'had', 'similar', 'fantasy', 'plots', 'nobody', 'group', 'regardless', 'weapons', 'skills', 'had', 'better', 'mess', 'elderly', 'little', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'pupils.A', 'HISTORY', 'OF', 'VIOLENCE', 'combines', 'sort', 'heroic', 'fantasy', 'erotic', 'fantasies', 'fairly', 'satisfying', 'way', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'best', 'known', 'Strider/Aragorn', 'THE', 'LORD', 'THE', 'RINGS', 'here', 'quiet', 'fellow', 'who', 'diner', 'who', 'delight', 'efficiently', 'series', 'tough', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'kill', 'Elements', 'mystery', 'are', 'stirred', 'who', 'really', 'what', 'sort', 'past', 'had', 'depth', 'added', 'having', 'wife', 'son', 'struggle', 'accept', 'hidden', 'facets', 'suddenly', 'Harris', 'William', 'Hurt', 'are', 'excellent', 'chief', 'villains', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'wonderful', 'hero', 'intelligent', 'sexy', 'wife', 'action', 'scenes', 'violent', 'erotic', 'are', 'skillfully', 'choreographed', 'including', 'fight', 'hero', 'son', 'bullies', 'high', 'school.The', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'include', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'can', 'discover', 'film', 'director', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'least', 'partly', 'sending', 'kind', 'message', 'many', 'viewers', 'probably', 'missed', 'wished', 'make', 'bit', 'more', 'aware', 'divided', 'feelings', 'using', 'violence', 'solution', 'own', 'problems', 'individuals', 'nation', 'Just', 'Mortensen', 'character', 'history', 'violence', 'prosecuter', 'might', 'say', 'many', 'including', 'many', 'leaders', 'have', 'long-term', 'preference', 'use', 'force', 'rather', 'other', 'solutions', 'own', 'impression', 'message', 'was', 'afterthought', 'was', 'not', 'fully', 'incorporated', 'plot', 'film.Considered', 'chiefly', 'fulfillment', 'David-and-Goliath', 'fantasy', 'needs', 'film', 'one', 'major', 'plot', 'weakness', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'corrected', 'never', 'learn', 'how', 'when', 'where', 'why', 'Mortensen', 'character', 'acquired', 'superior', 'martial-arts', 'skills', 'moves', 'are', 'clearly', 'not', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'picked', 'up', 'bar', 'fights', 'street', 'fights', 'Imagine', 'KILL', 'BILL', 'movies', 'such', 'plot-gap', 'audience', 'HAS', 'know', 'where', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'David', 'Carradine', 'many', 'rest', 'learned', 'fight', 'so', 'well', 'Even', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'got', 'many', 'flashbacks', 'Shaolin', 'temple', 'where', 'Carradine', 'character', 'got', 'training', 'KARATE', 'KID', 'found', 'out', 'Pat', 'Morita', 'character', 'was', 'taught', 'karate', 'father', 'Okinawa.If', 'would', 'like', 'watch', '5-star', 'heroic', 'underdog', 'fantasy', 'buy', 'borrow', 'rent', 'BAD', 'DAY', 'AT', 'BLACK', 'ROCK', '1955', 'film', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'one-armed', 'WWII', 'veteran', 'who', 'out', 'trash', 'um', 'single', 'handedly']",N/A

""A History Of Violence"" makes you believe something one minute, then completely mess's with your mind into making you think and believe in somthing else.

Interesting premise.(Possible spoilers to come, so proceed at your own risk.)There is one thing especially wrong with this movie and that is the adamant reaction of Tom Stall's family when they learn the truth.  I can't say more without revealing too much plot detail, but for those who have seen the movie, you may know what I am saying.  His family, regardless of what they learned, could not help but be one hundred percent on his side.  The most they should have said is, ""You should have told us"" and yet even that is too much.  They should come to the realization of what kind of man he is as the audience does, slowly and only after the final scenes.  This is the kind of cinematic mistake that directors sometimes make.  They are completely familiar with the material.  They know how it ends and so they sometimes put their characters in the frame of mind that their characters would have if their characters knew everything the director knew.  But Edie and the kids did not know who their father really was even after the scene when the black Cadillac Escalade pulls up into their yard.  I know if my spouse or father had been such a good man for so many years, I would not turn on him just because he kicked a bit too much tail a bit too successfully, especially when saving other people's lives.Otherwise this is a kind of brilliant movie.  The ending is perfect.  The psychology is straight out of evo psych; a kind of forbidden truth is told on several levels, and when all is said and done, the little girl goes and gets the plate and the silverware, and the son passes the roast to his father.  What else is there to be done?  One can imagine that this is how it is and has been for tens of thousands of years in the household of the warlord, the house of the man who managed to survive--never mind how.  Such is the nature of human beings.There are a couple of very true to life sex scenes in this movie that will be too much for people who have cliche ideas about sex or like to kid themselves a lot.  Again those of you who have seen the movie will know what I am talking about: well, the one in which Edie says we never experienced high school together is one of them.  The scene on the staircase is the other.  They are both well done.The redeeming factor for the hero is that we never see him do anything except in self-defense.  He has an amazing ability to protect himself and to put those who attack him out of their misery.  It's almost comic book, cowboy movie quality.  Yet I think Cronenberg made it so realistic that you almost believe it could happened.  Mortensen's character is part of the hero/superman/ninja/two-fisted/John Wayne type of guy who can win a barroom fight against a half dozen other men, a guy who can beat a trio of armed toughs, stripping them of their weapons and using them against them because he is quicker and more deadly.  A nice bit of supporting psychology is all of the business with the son and the school bully.  The way the son handles him actually supports the violent-hero mythology: like father, like son.  It's in the blood.The title of the film suggests a documentary.  But if you think instead about something that somebody would say about an individual's past you'll see that the title is apt.Nice supporting work by Ed Harris and William Hurt.  But let's face it, this is an R-rated movie without much in the way of redeeming social value, and is in fact a very nice seduction of its targeted audience, which is what one would expect from Cronenberg.",3,Beware of people in black Cadillac Escalades,1173052800,"03 5, 2007",2007,4800,"['Horror-meister', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'AKA', 'King', 'Venereal', 'Horror', 'Baron', 'Blood', 'began', 'directing', 'movies', 'sixties', 'mostly', 'made-for-TV', 'fare', 'then', 'moved', 'big', 'screen', 'seventies', 'forgettable', 'scifi/horror', 'flicks', 'then', 'eighties', 'perfected', 'art', 'can', 'call', 'prefer', 'call', 'cynical', 'seduction', 'audience', 'playing', 'worse', 'fears', 'hey', 'never', 'had', 'make', 'living', 'filmland', 'e.g.', 'Scanners', '1981', 'Fly', '1986', 'Dead', 'Ringers', '1988', 'etc', 'Here', 'plain', 'ordinary', 'two-fisted', 'psycho/mobster/killer-type', 'violence.Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'who', 'diner', 'small', 'midwestern', 'town', 'likeable', 'guy', 'wife', 'Edie', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'two', 'kids', 'just', 'average', 'joe', 'one', 'day', 'cold-blooded', 'killers', 'diner', 'decide', 'rape', 'pillage', 'Tom', 'take', 'guns', 'send', 'meet', 'maker', 'bit', 'surprising', 'heroics', 'draws', 'attention', 'mobsters', 'Philadelphia', 'apparently', 'think', 'Tom', 'onetime', 'mobster/hit', 'man', 'named', 'Joey', 'Cusack', 'who', 'had', 'done', 'grievous', 'harm', 'past', 'want', 'revenge', 'question', 'have', 'got', 'man', 'tragic', 'case', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'Interesting', 'premise', 'Possible', 'spoilers', 'come', 'so', 'proceed', 'own', 'risk', 'one', 'thing', 'especially', 'wrong', 'movie', 'adamant', 'reaction', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'family', 'when', 'learn', 'truth', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'detail', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'may', 'know', 'what', 'am', 'saying', 'family', 'regardless', 'what', 'learned', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'one', 'hundred', 'percent', 'side', 'most', 'should', 'have', 'said', 'should', 'have', 'told', 'yet', 'even', 'too', 'much', 'should', 'come', 'realization', 'what', 'kind', 'man', 'audience', 'slowly', 'only', 'final', 'scenes', 'kind', 'cinematic', 'mistake', 'directors', 'sometimes', 'make', 'are', 'completely', 'familiar', 'material', 'know', 'how', 'so', 'sometimes', 'put', 'characters', 'frame', 'mind', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'characters', 'knew', 'everything', 'director', 'knew', 'Edie', 'kids', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'who', 'father', 'really', 'was', 'even', 'scene', 'when', 'black', 'Cadillac', 'Escalade', 'up', 'yard', 'know', 'spouse', 'father', 'had', 'been', 'such', 'good', 'man', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'would', 'not', 'turn', 'just', 'kicked', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'tail', 'bit', 'too', 'successfully', 'especially', 'when', 'saving', 'other', 'people', 'lives.Otherwise', 'kind', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'ending', 'perfect', 'psychology', 'straight', 'evo', 'psych', 'kind', 'forbidden', 'truth', 'told', 'several', 'levels', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'little', 'girl', 'plate', 'silverware', 'son', 'roast', 'father', 'What', 'else', 'be', 'done', 'One', 'can', 'imagine', 'how', 'been', 'tens', 'thousands', 'years', 'household', 'warlord', 'house', 'man', 'who', 'managed', 'survive', 'never', 'mind', 'how', 'Such', 'nature', 'human', 'are', 'couple', 'very', 'true', 'life', 'sex', 'scenes', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'cliche', 'ideas', 'sex', 'kid', 'lot', 'Again', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'am', 'talking', 'well', 'one', 'Edie', 'never', 'experienced', 'high', 'school', 'together', 'one', 'scene', 'staircase', 'other', 'are', 'well', 'done.The', 'redeeming', 'factor', 'hero', 'never', 'see', 'do', 'anything', 'self-defense', 'amazing', 'ability', 'protect', 'put', 'who', 'attack', 'misery', 'almost', 'comic', 'book', 'cowboy', 'movie', 'quality', 'think', 'Cronenberg', 'made', 'so', 'realistic', 'almost', 'believe', 'could', 'happened', 'Mortensen', 'character', 'part', 'hero/superman/ninja/two-fisted/John', 'Wayne', 'type', 'guy', 'who', 'can', 'win', 'barroom', 'fight', 'half', 'dozen', 'other', 'men', 'guy', 'who', 'can', 'beat', 'trio', 'armed', 'toughs', 'stripping', 'weapons', 'using', 'quicker', 'more', 'deadly', 'nice', 'bit', 'supporting', 'psychology', 'business', 'son', 'school', 'bully', 'way', 'son', 'actually', 'violent-hero', 'mythology', 'father', 'son', 'blood.The', 'title', 'film', 'documentary', 'think', 'instead', 'something', 'somebody', 'would', 'say', 'individual', ""'ll"", 'see', 'title', 'apt.Nice', 'supporting', 'work', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'William', 'Hurt', 'let', 'face', 'R-rated', 'movie', 'much', 'way', 'redeeming', 'social', 'value', 'fact', 'very', 'nice', 'seduction', 'targeted', 'audience', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Cronenberg']",N/A

960178,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B000CQLZ0Q,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[9, 14]","In ""A History of Violence,"" director, David Cronenberg, creates a masterful study of the human psyche adapted from the graphic novel of the same name by John Wagner and Vince Locke.  Performances by Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello, Ashton Holmes, Ed Harris and a particularly enjoyable one by William Hurt intensify from one frame to the next, bringing to life the simple plot line that unfurls a deeper metaphor with as many tasty layers as an Outback Steakhouse Bloomin' Onion.Rather than reiterate the story once again, I will state only that when an unforeseen event catapults Tom Stall's other self back into action, he and his family must deal with not only the repercussions but with a new understanding of someone they thought they knew and trusted.Where many of the other reviewers focus on the film's violence that we, as 21st century denizens thoroughly familiarized with the Newtonian ideas of action versus reaction, experience on an almost quotidian basis and subsequently either absorb or repel, I suggest that this engrossing film flicks on an inner light that illumines and asks us to explore those hidden secret parts of ourselves.  Either through reinvention or suppression, we all decide to tuck away certain aspects of our true nature.  The legendary party-goer, for instance, once becoming a parent, may, out of a sense of responsibility or respectability dispense with the accoutrements of those wild Friday and Saturday nights.  In order to be eligible for that special promotion, one may opt to cut one's hair, have that tattoo lasered off the ankle and change one's vocabulary to reflect the individual worthy of earning more cash.  We take on different roles as we move forward (or backwards) in life; we become someone's spouse . . . someone's boss . . . someone's parent . . . someone's someone that infers evolving into a role model that knows all the right things to say and do that will keep us positioned and functioning as this archetype.Like Tom Stall, played to perfection by Viggo Mortensen in the film, we are subject to the events of the past.  Suggestive of the scorpion in the fable whose nature it is to sting the frog he is helping to cross the river and hence, destroy himself, we will find ourselves reverting back to that self---that real identifying ""me"" without any of the qualifying subtitles (wife, mother, father, sister, etc.)  that we either reengineered through self-reinvention or suppressed in order to forget or seemingly progress.Perhaps Cronenberg poses the question, ""Can one justly suppress one's true nature?""  Does he suggest in the form of this story that like others who at one time or another in their adulthood undergo what is commonly called a ""second childhood,"" that Stall like ourselves will mid-life-crisis out and struggle to regain that piece of himself that was his and only his from birth despite what other standards he has attributed to or acquired for himself?Bottom line?  See the film.  Yes, it has its moments of violence, but look beyond that and examine the theme of reinvention and self-identity that Cronenberg so wisely pushes up from the depths of the subconscious.  Check out the differences in the two sex scenes between Mortensen and Bello and revel in the last few minutes of the film where silence conveys a wealth of emotions which range from hopefulness to acceptance.  Recommended to all that are not thrown by a graphic novel's sense of violence.Diana F.

The viewer is cast into a small town in Indiana. David Cronenberg (Director) develops each character just enough to spoon feed the viewer into doubt.Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) is a small town diner owner. He is married to Edie (Maria Bello) and has two teenage kids. All seems normal until would be murders stop at his diner. He thwarts the murders but is cast as a hero in the national media.When Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris) a big time Philadelphia mobster stops by his diner for a conversation with Tom a shadow is cast. Is it a case of mistaken identity? Secrets will be revealed. William Hurt's performance of Richie Cusack is portrayed majestically.The action sequences are detailed and graphic. But violence is always graphic right? The relationship between Tom and Edie is a mystery but portrayed as layered. I really enjoyed this film because of the Director's filming techniques. (I.e.

The film takes it's time getting started, which is a good thing. It sets up the two criminals as violent, cruel and heartless men, as evidenced by the one guy shooting a small girl down in cold blood. Once the film moves to Tom Stall's town in Indiana, and the killers show up in his store, the story takes off and kept me fascinated till the end. The plot line certainly led me to completly believe it when the son in the family fought back against a bully who'd been harrassing him in and out of school. The violence, while vivid at times, was certainly justified by the story. The nude scene with Maria Bello could have been done without, but it didn't completely ruin the story. At the end of the film you're left with a family that is pretty much destroyed by the events of the film. I kept wondering what would happen to them and found the final scene particularly moving, with the parents both in tears for the ruin their happy lives have become and the teenage boy aware of the problems, their young daughter quite oblivious to it all in her innocence. The only thing that surprised me was William Hurt getting an oscar nomination for this film, since he's barely in it at all. I highly recommend this film for anyone who wants to see an intelligent and moving film of a family torn apart by violence, accusations and the recriminations of doubt that can happen to people who are accused of something that no one is completly sure that they're innocent of.",4,An amazing film,1148947200,"05 30, 2006",2006,1569,"['Contrary', 'many', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'here', 'thought', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'was', 'amazing', 'film', 'film', 'time', 'getting', 'started', 'good', 'thing', 'up', 'two', 'criminals', 'violent', 'cruel', 'heartless', 'men', 'evidenced', 'one', 'guy', 'shooting', 'small', 'girl', 'down', 'cold', 'blood', 'film', 'moves', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'town', 'Indiana', 'killers', 'show', 'up', 'store', 'story', 'kept', 'fascinated', 'end', 'plot', 'line', 'certainly', 'led', 'completly', 'believe', 'when', 'son', 'family', 'fought', 'back', 'bully', 'who', ""'d"", 'been', 'harrassing', 'school', 'violence', 'vivid', 'times', 'was', 'certainly', 'justified', 'story', 'nude', 'scene', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'did', ""n't"", 'completely', 'ruin', 'story', 'end', 'film', ""'re"", 'left', 'family', 'pretty', 'much', 'destroyed', 'events', 'film', 'kept', 'wondering', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'found', 'final', 'scene', 'particularly', 'moving', 'parents', 'tears', 'ruin', 'happy', 'lives', 'have', 'become', 'teenage', 'boy', 'aware', 'problems', 'young', 'daughter', 'quite', 'oblivious', 'innocence', 'only', 'thing', 'surprised', 'was', 'William', 'Hurt', 'getting', 'oscar', 'nomination', 'film', 'barely', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'see', 'intelligent', 'moving', 'film', 'family', 'torn', 'apart', 'violence', 'accusations', 'recriminations', 'doubt', 'can', 'happen', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'accused', 'something', 'one', 'completly', 'sure', ""'re"", 'innocent']",N/A

There is nothing salient or remarkable about Tom;  he lives a simple life, owns a coffee shop in a small town in Indiana and tries his best to be a good husband and family man.  Tom Stahl would be an excellent subject for a Norman Rockwell painting.However, Tom has a deep dark secret that is exposed via a random chance encounter with bad guys who wish to rob his coffee shop.  Tom was formerly Joey, and Joey was a hit-man for the Philadelphia mob.  After the incident, Tom's buried past is disinterred.Such is an outline of the plot line.  The movie is well worth seeing to see the psychological struggle between a man who almost has a sort of split-personality complex.  Both Tom & Joey would like nothing better than to live the  mundane, unglamorous life of Tom Stahl.  However, the abilities of Joey must be called upon to preserve that life of normalcy & protect his family.I very much enjoyed this film as it is something of a ""switch"" from what we're used to.  So many times, movies center around every-day characters who fantasize about being secret agents and such.  In this case, the main character is a highly trained killer who wants nothing more than  a life of peace, simplicity and obscurity.Even though I'm not huge on mob movies, I would highly recommend this one.

960191,A9CKMSQ6ZEWLB,B000CQLZ0Q,D. Rodgers,"[3, 9]","In director David Cronenberg's latest thriller A History of Violence we follow the story of Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen), the local town family man with a pretty wife and two kids. Tom owns a diner in the middle of the small town of Millbrook, Indiana, where life is simple and quiet. That is until two killers show up looking for trouble. One of the guys draws a gun and tells Tom to empty the cash register and threatens to kill the remaining customers. He responds by leaping over the counter, and gunning down the two men in an instant. Tom is considered to be a hero for taking down the two criminals, but he says it was just shear luck. Or was it? That's when Carl Fogarty (played perfectly by Ed Harris) shows up thinking that Tom is actually a man named Joey Cusack; a hit-man from Philadelphia, who nearly killed him many years ago. So who are we to believe? Is this all just a case of mistaken identity, or does Tom really have a dark past that he's tried so hard to keep a secret?A History of Violence is based on the graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke. The film is quite effective, especially in showcasing how fragile the human body really is. The brutal violence of the film is quick and sudden, and always justified. It's not shown in slow motion to ""milk"" or glamorize it, but to show it as Earth-shattering and vicious, which you hardly see in modern movies, because it's often stylized to look pretty and entertaining. But even as the violence is entirely justified in A History of Violence, it's also a startling reminder of just how ugly it can be.David Cronenberg's A History of Violence is not a film for everyone, some will really like it, and others will hate it. But whether you liked it or not, anyone who claims to know anything about films in general has to be able to admit that it is undeniably well made and acted, and at only 96 minutes long, doesn't waste any time doing anything other than storytelling that advances the plot and characters. That being said, A History of Violence isn't really about plot twists as much as it is about characters and character development. Only upon multiple viewings can you really appreciate the great performances from this cast. It's the small things, body language, gestures, eye movements; all of these things allow us to read what's going on in the character's mind at a given moment. And this is important for understanding A History of Violence, because this is an emotionally complex film, and sometimes it's the things that people don't say that speak the loudest.Cronenberg himself has said that he is a complete Darwinian, and the idea of survival of the fittest fits perfectly in context in A History of Violence, because deep down inside Tom is Joey, and Joey is the fittest to survive in a world of violence. But Tom is the person Joey wishes he was; an illusion of peace and happiness. It's not until Joey can finally come face to face with his own history of violence, that he's tried so hard to escape, and has successfully done so for quite some time (that is until he became a hero), that he'll be able to escape his past once and for all. That's why it's called A History of Violence, because it asks the question can someone change their own past history of violence and create a true, and authentic new life that's free of violence?",5,"Stunning and well executed, one of the best films of 2005",1143331200,"03 26, 2006",2006,3332,"['director', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'latest', 'thriller', 'History', 'Violence', 'follow', 'story', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'local', 'town', 'family', 'man', 'pretty', 'wife', 'two', 'kids', 'Tom', 'diner', 'middle', 'small', 'town', 'Millbrook', 'Indiana', 'where', 'life', 'simple', 'quiet', 'two', 'killers', 'show', 'up', 'looking', 'trouble', 'One', 'guys', 'gun', 'tells', 'Tom', 'empty', 'cash', 'register', 'kill', 'remaining', 'customers', 'leaping', 'counter', 'gunning', 'down', 'two', 'men', 'instant', 'Tom', 'considered', 'be', 'hero', 'taking', 'down', 'two', 'criminals', 'was', 'just', 'shear', 'luck', 'was', 'when', 'Carl', 'Fogarty', 'played', 'perfectly', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'up', 'thinking', 'Tom', 'actually', 'man', 'named', 'Joey', 'Cusack', 'hit-man', 'Philadelphia', 'who', 'nearly', 'killed', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'who', 'are', 'believe', 'just', 'case', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'Tom', 'really', 'have', 'dark', 'past', 'tried', 'so', 'hard', 'keep', 'secret', 'History', 'Violence', 'based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'John', 'Wagner', 'Vince', 'Locke', 'film', 'quite', 'effective', 'especially', 'showcasing', 'how', 'fragile', 'human', 'body', 'really', 'brutal', 'violence', 'film', 'quick', 'sudden', 'always', 'justified', 'not', 'shown', 'slow', 'motion', 'milk', 'glamorize', 'show', 'Earth-shattering', 'vicious', 'hardly', 'see', 'modern', 'movies', 'often', 'stylized', 'look', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'even', 'violence', 'entirely', 'justified', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'also', 'startling', 'reminder', 'just', 'how', 'ugly', 'can', 'be.David', 'Cronenberg', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'will', 'really', 'like', 'others', 'will', 'hate', 'liked', 'not', 'anyone', 'who', 'know', 'anything', 'films', 'general', 'be', 'able', 'admit', 'undeniably', 'well', 'made', 'acted', 'only', '96', 'minutes', 'long', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'doing', 'anything', 'other', 'storytelling', 'plot', 'characters', 'being', 'said', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', ""n't"", 'really', 'plot', 'twists', 'as', 'much', 'characters', 'character', 'development', 'Only', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'can', 'really', 'appreciate', 'great', 'performances', 'cast', 'small', 'things', 'body', 'language', 'gestures', 'eye', 'movements', 'things', 'allow', 'read', 'what', 'going', 'character', 'mind', 'given', 'moment', 'important', 'understanding', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'emotionally', 'complex', 'film', 'things', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'speak', 'loudest.Cronenberg', 'said', 'complete', 'Darwinian', 'idea', 'survival', 'fittest', 'fits', 'perfectly', 'context', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'deep', 'down', 'inside', 'Tom', 'Joey', 'Joey', 'fittest', 'survive', 'world', 'violence', 'Tom', 'person', 'Joey', 'was', 'illusion', 'peace', 'happiness', 'not', 'Joey', 'can', 'finally', 'come', 'face', 'face', 'own', 'history', 'violence', 'tried', 'so', 'hard', 'escape', 'successfully', 'done', 'so', 'quite', 'time', 'became', 'hero', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'escape', 'past', 'once', 'why', 'called', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'question', 'can', 'someone', 'change', 'own', 'past', 'history', 'violence', 'create', 'true', 'authentic', 'new', 'life', 'free', 'violence']",N/A

But basically we have the story of a man trying to escape his violent past, and doing a good job of it, until the past catches up with him because of a quirk of fate and his own heroic actions.  As the main character, Tom Stall, tries to deal with his past in the menacing form of Ed Harris, as a very convincing mobster, sub-plots are also playing out.  These include the relationship between Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) and his wife (Maria Bello), the relationship betwen Tom and his teenage son, and the tension between the son and the school jock/bully.  There are two very steamy sex scenes between Tom and his wife.  (I loved the cheerleader costume.)  The producer's commentary points out that these scenes are notable for two reasons: first it is rare to have sex scenes only between a man and his wife in a movie, and second, this is the first American film to show the sexual technique known as ""69"".  The movie is also unusual in that the two best known actors (Ed Harris and Wiliam Hurt) play relatively minor, though critical, roles.  The actor who plays the sheriff is also excellent, as he tries to balance his duty towards the law and his love for his friends. The editing is tight and the action fast-paced.

While laboriously meandering toward this task, the audience is treated to the sight of two dead people lying in pools of blood.

960195,AC1K4OQOZ90RS,B000CQLZ0Q,"E. Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[2, 3]","The hero of ""A History of Violence"" is Tom Stall, played with great sensitivity and strength by the virile Viggo Mortensen.  Tom owns a diner in Millbrook, a small Indiana town.  Millbrook is a warm and friendly place, and Tom is a popular businessman.  He is completely devoted to his beautiful wife, Edie, and their two children, Jack and Sarah.  When Jack retaliates after being mercilessly bullied and humiliated by a classmate, Tom feelingly tells his son that beating people up does not solve anything.Tom's life changes when two psychotic criminals come into his diner at closing time.  The thugs make no effort to hide their intentions.  When Tom manages to quickly and effortlessly disarm the intruders, he is hailed by his friends, neighbors, and the media.  He becomes a celebrity, with his name and photo splashed all over television and the newspapers.  Although his fame is good for business, Tom's notoriety has some unpleasant side effects.  Three tough guys from Tom's past spot his picture and decide to pay him a visit.Cronenberg elicits fine performances from an excellent cast.  Mortensen is a sympathetic and strong protagonist; the lovely Maria Bello plays Edie Stall, a woman who suddenly finds out that there is a hidden side to her husband.  Ed Harris, always an outstanding character actor, is terrific in the small role of Carl Fogarty, a sadistic brute with a long memory. Finally, William Hurt is delightfully over the top as Richie Cusack, a mobster with attitude.  He imbues his character with an offbeat combination of vicious humor and menace.  The movie is stark, spare, and well-edited.  The scenes of carnage are particularly shocking when viewed against the backdrop of everyday life in a small town where nothing much ever happens.  Cronenberg and the screenwriter wisely do not supply us with facile explanations, leaving the audience to ponder the issues raised themselves.""A History of Violence"" poses these thought-provoking questions: How well can an individual ever know the person he or she marries?  Can someone successfully reinvent himself?  Is it possible to continue living with a spouse who has lied for years? This movie is not meant to be realistic.  It is an allegory about an insane culture that celebrates selfishness, greed, and aggression.

960197,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000CQLZ0Q,Ed Uyeshima,"[0, 0]","For the melodramatic premise it looks like it's going to present, this movie shouldn't have worked. But leave it to veteran director David Cronenberg to defy expectations and capture lightning in a bottle with a searing exploration of violence and duplicity. The movie opens with a chilling scene of the aftermath of a harshly bloody act that leads inevitably to another shocking act, but then it shifts gears to a pastoral, Thornton Wilder-like town. The story then focuses on Tom Stall, an upstanding citizen and owner of the local diner. He's been happily married for twenty years to Edie, still a knockout and now a successful lawyer, and they have two children. An unexpected incident in the diner makes Tom a media hero much to his chagrin, and it also brings the attention of some obvious mobsters who think Tom is someone else.While the vigilante set-up sounds like a tribute to the Warner Brothers film noir crime drama of the 1940's, the 2005 film is surprisingly a thoughtful and downright chilling meditation on the causes of violence and the unexpected, almost inevitable ramifications. To say anything more would ruin the plot, but suffice it to say that the movie haunts and resonates with flashes of unflinching violence that only Cronenberg can do graphically without being gratuitous. The foreboding title signals the necessity of the violence, though the shots are relatively subdued from the man responsible for the memorable head explosions in 1981'sScannersand the gooey transformation in the 1986 update ofThe Fly.A gallery of superb performances brings out the wired intensity of the characters starting with the always underrated Viggo Mortenson who is ideally cast as Tom. Looking almost like Gary Cooper but with a dark edge, Mortenson powerfully plays the role right on the balance between decency and denial. Even more impressive is Maria Bello, who simply electrifies as Edie especially as the revelations transform her existence. The stairway scene with Mortenson and Bello elicits a visceral energy that scorches the screen. Ashton Holmes is terrific as their teenage son Jack, who unexpectedly taps into his own anger with a high school bully.In smaller parts that sometimes threaten to broaden toward stereotype, Ed Harris taps into the feral side of his screen persona as Carl Fogarty, a one-eyed mobster who is convinced he knows Tom, and a surprisingly ferocious William Hurt holds his ten minutes of screen time as Richie Cusack, as he provides the key to the unraveling plot. Based on a graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke, the film is ultimately a parable about violence as much as Paul Haggis'sCrash(not Cronenberg's film with the same title) is a parable about racism. However, the major difference is that Cronenberg and screenwriter Josh Olson do not layer contrivances to hammer down on obvious points in their story, and the ending is effectively and hauntingly open-ended. This is a gripping cinematic work strongly recommended.The DVD package is excellent with one of the best making-of documentaries I have seen for a major release, an hour-long feature called ""Acts of Violence"". It is divided effectively in eight acts with particularly thoughtful comments from Cronenberg, Mortenson and Bello. Cronenberg also provides terrific commentary on an alternate audio track, and there are actually two extras related to a deleted fantasy scene that reflects the more typically gory side of Cronenberg's style. The only feature of lesser interest is a featurette tracking the film to the Cannes Film Festival.",5,Gripping Meditation on Violence Superbly Rendered by Cronenberg and Stellar Cast,1142985600,"03 22, 2006",2006,3562,"['melodramatic', 'premise', 'going', 'present', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'worked', 'leave', 'veteran', 'director', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'defy', 'expectations', 'capture', 'lightning', 'bottle', 'searing', 'exploration', 'violence', 'duplicity', 'movie', 'chilling', 'scene', 'aftermath', 'harshly', 'bloody', 'act', 'inevitably', 'shocking', 'act', 'then', 'gears', 'pastoral', 'Thornton', 'Wilder-like', 'town', 'story', 'then', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'upstanding', 'citizen', 'owner', 'local', 'diner', 'been', 'happily', 'married', 'twenty', 'years', 'Edie', 'still', 'knockout', 'now', 'successful', 'lawyer', 'have', 'two', 'children', 'unexpected', 'incident', 'diner', 'Tom', 'media', 'hero', 'much', 'chagrin', 'also', 'attention', 'obvious', 'mobsters', 'who', 'think', 'Tom', 'someone', 'vigilante', 'set-up', 'sounds', 'tribute', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'film', 'noir', 'crime', 'drama', '1940', '2005', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'thoughtful', 'downright', 'chilling', 'meditation', 'causes', 'violence', 'unexpected', 'almost', 'inevitable', 'ramifications', 'say', 'anything', 'more', 'would', 'ruin', 'plot', 'say', 'movie', 'haunts', 'resonates', 'flashes', 'unflinching', 'violence', 'only', 'Cronenberg', 'can', 'do', 'graphically', 'being', 'gratuitous', 'foreboding', 'title', 'necessity', 'violence', 'shots', 'are', 'relatively', 'subdued', 'man', 'responsible', 'memorable', 'head', 'explosions', ""1981'sScannersand"", 'gooey', 'transformation', '1986', 'update', 'ofThe', 'Fly.A', 'gallery', 'superb', 'performances', 'out', 'wired', 'intensity', 'characters', 'starting', 'always', 'underrated', 'Viggo', 'Mortenson', 'who', 'ideally', 'cast', 'Tom', 'Looking', 'almost', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'dark', 'edge', 'Mortenson', 'powerfully', 'role', 'right', 'balance', 'decency', 'denial', 'Even', 'more', 'impressive', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'who', 'simply', 'Edie', 'especially', 'revelations', 'transform', 'existence', 'stairway', 'scene', 'Mortenson', 'Bello', 'visceral', 'energy', 'screen', 'Ashton', 'Holmes', 'terrific', 'teenage', 'son', 'Jack', 'who', 'unexpectedly', 'own', 'anger', 'high', 'school', 'bully.In', 'smaller', 'parts', 'sometimes', 'threaten', 'broaden', 'stereotype', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'feral', 'side', 'screen', 'persona', 'Carl', 'Fogarty', 'one-eyed', 'mobster', 'who', 'convinced', 'Tom', 'surprisingly', 'ferocious', 'William', 'Hurt', 'ten', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'Richie', 'Cusack', 'key', 'unraveling', 'plot', 'Based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'John', 'Wagner', 'Vince', 'Locke', 'film', 'ultimately', 'parable', 'about', 'violence', 'as', 'much', 'Paul', ""Haggis'sCrash"", 'not', 'Cronenberg', 'film', 'same', 'title', 'parable', 'racism', 'However', 'major', 'difference', 'Cronenberg', 'screenwriter', 'Josh', 'Olson', 'do', 'not', 'layer', 'contrivances', 'hammer', 'down', 'obvious', 'points', 'story', 'ending', 'effectively', 'hauntingly', 'open-ended', 'gripping', 'cinematic', 'work', 'strongly', 'DVD', 'package', 'excellent', 'one', 'best', 'making-of', 'documentaries', 'have', 'seen', 'major', 'release', 'hour-long', 'feature', 'called', 'Acts', 'Violence', 'divided', 'effectively', 'eight', 'acts', 'particularly', 'thoughtful', 'comments', 'Cronenberg', 'Mortenson', 'Bello', 'Cronenberg', 'also', 'terrific', 'commentary', 'alternate', 'audio', 'track', 'are', 'actually', 'two', 'extras', 'related', 'deleted', 'fantasy', 'scene', 'more', 'typically', 'gory', 'side', 'Cronenberg', 'style', 'only', 'feature', 'lesser', 'interest', 'featurette', 'tracking', 'film', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival']",N/A

The movie starts out with us witnessing without witnessing two shady men murder the staff of a roadside motel for no apparent reason.  Next scene, a young girl is screaming, awakened from her sleep by a nightmare.  She is soon comforted by her father, her older brother and her mother.  They seem to be the prefect small town family.Tom Stall, the father, runs a diner in their picture perfect Indiana town and it is within the next few moments of the movie that we are once again introduced to the shady men from the beginning, as they enter Tom's diner.  Not much time passes before we learn they are not in the diner as customers, and definitely mean to bring harm to the owner, his employees and the patrons.It is at this moment that we learn that Tom possesses very finely tuned self-defense skills, as he saves the day by expertly ""taking care"" of the bad guys.  Such skills as those are not common in ordinary, small town people.  The media, always loving a heroic story, flock around Tom and soon his story is broadcast far and wide on several news stations.  Tom, who isn't welcoming to the idea of being a national hero, comes off as being modest to his family and friends, but is quite obviously to us, the viewers, hiding something.The truth begins to unfold when Tom is visited by a couple of mobsters who believe he is actually Joey Cusack, a man who had violently crossed them years ago back in Philly, and caused one of the men to lose his eye.  Naturally, Tom denies this is true, but that doesn't last long and what follows is a short-lived stand-off between Tom and the two mobsters.There is another part to the back story, involving Tom/Joey's older brother Richie.  He's a successful, very wealthy mobster still living in Philly.  When Tom is summoned to pay his older brother a visit, you just know it isn't a request made out of brotherly love.  Richie is angry because Joey has made it difficult for him to reach the status he wishes to acquire within the mafia circle.  Another short-lived stand-off ensues, and what we are left with is just about the most boring and seemingly incomplete ending to a movie that I've ever seen!Overall, I think the movie was all right.  It had great potential, and I wished it had gone into more detail of Tom's past.  What I'm thinking is that this movie needed about another hour's worth of story explaining the details of Tom's past.  96 minutes is extremely short, especially by today's running time standards.  In any case, I feel that all of the actors did well with what they were given, and the general idea behind the story was very good.  I'd recommend this, sure.  But as a rental only - I don't think it holds much replay value.**Edited to include the the fact that I wasn't aware that this movie was taken from a book when I watched/reviewed it.

The worst and best of man are portrayed, needy depravity and sublime potential.  The movie exposes the futility of man's contrivances to both escape and avoid evil (pain, chaos, unhappiness).  In addition to plenty of violence, there are a few sex scenes showing both frontal and behind nudity as well as some violence, but the sex is between a married couple and integral to the story.  The portrayal of violence is raw, realistic, graphic and necessary, rather than the kind of overchoreographed thrill scenes from Mr. & Mrs. Smith or the dark, artistic hyperbole of Natural Born Killers.  'A History of Violence' has no tidy wrap-up ending, leaving the viewer to come to one's own conclusions; it is not an upper nor a downer, just a glimpse of an ugly part of reality worth contemplating.

Ok, so this movie is not bad, but its nothing fantastic either.  The acting is good, (when they actually act), and the story is decent, (when there is story).  The real problem is the bare-bone script, (even the actors and director admits that there isnt that much to the script calling is simple and slim).  Not a whole lot happens.  I mean sure, it is about human nature and blah blah blah but in all reality, i doubt any of these events would happen in the real world so it is just a fake study.

He acts one moment like he doesnt know what to do and the next like a super professional who has done it everyday of his life.  there are a few sex scenes that I guess are supposed to show something deep about the characters but I just think the director wanted to put some sex in just for thrills because its not like the made sense, especially the second one.  I mean would two people really have sex right then?  i think not...The movie moves slow, which i dont mind.  Also the action is borderline kill bill at times, which i can deal with.

960208,AS62A5MC52IEH,B000CQLZ0Q,Floyd the Barber,"[6, 12]","David Cronenberg is all about how bad people can be and in this movie he shows that ""family ties"" matter and don't matter a bit.Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) is a nice guy with a nice wife (Maria Bello) and two great kids lving in a little town in Indiana.  He owns a diner where comfortable folks come to eat and the town's the kind of place where people care about each other.  Tom and Edie are so much in love that they can act out their erotic fantasies in middle age as if they are for the first time.  (And of course Edie as a cheerleader is a really cute sexual fantasy.)  These are the middlest of middle Americans.  Or are they?Tom's living a double life and his cover is blown by, of all things, doing a good deed.  (Now there's irony for you.)  From that moment, the moment where he kills two intrusive animal types, all hell breaks loose, revealing by degrees Tom's not-so-middle American background.  (It also establishes Tom as the movie's good guy and mighty man.  And indeed, he pulls off some pretty impressive escape acts.)Turns out Tom is a bad guy from Philly who's been trying to conceal his background and lead a new, scrubbed clean life in Indiana with Edie and the kid.  The movie unfolds as Tom confronts and then tries literally to kill the vestiges of his past:  first, Carl Forgarty (Ed Harris) and then his own brother Richie (William Hurt).The movie is a kind of reverse ""Straw Dogs.""  An idyllic, apparently happy lifestyle is rent apart until the emergent alpha male can put Eden back together again.  Dustin Hoffman's bifurcate man becomes known to him and us only because of the violence that is thrust upon him.  Tom Stall/Joey Cusack's split personality is one that he wanted dead, never to return.  Once again, however, it is violence thrust upon him that he must deal with, first with someone who intrudes into his idyllic life and who threatens his wife and kids and then, journeying to gangster hell (Philadelphia, it seems), in the ""heart of darkness.""  (It's not coincidence that Joey must kill his own brother finally to be free of himself.  His brother is of course his bad man alter ego.)Mortensen and Bello render decent performances, although the latter's was rather over the top in some ways.  The true stars are Harris and Hurt, both of whom are aided however by playing bad guys. (This is easier to pull off than Mortensen's task.)  Of the two, by far the better acting job is Harris's, who is extremely convincing as Carl Fogarty.  Hurt relies on too much acting schtick and puts baffles between us, the audience, and his character.  Indeed, his ""Ritchie"" is a kind of caricature.Fans of Cronenberg will both rejoice in and despair of this movie.  On the one hand, Cronenberg brings violence to such a peak of shocking reality that it cannot fail to impress.  However, that he had to resort to formula here to do it suggests that his more artistic trajectory has been highjacked or at least waylaid.In sum, the movie offers too much that is reminiscent of other older movies (righteous man defends home and family)to rank it among great films.  True, Cronenberg alters the formula to some degree.  But the result is not satisfying as truly original ... or truly Cronenberg.",2,Rebuilt Straw Dogs/Cape Fear,1143590400,"03 29, 2006",2006,3222,"['David', 'Cronenberg', 'how', 'bad', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'movie', 'family', 'ties', 'matter', 'do', ""n't"", 'matter', 'bit.Tom', 'Stall', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'nice', 'guy', 'nice', 'wife', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'two', 'great', 'kids', 'lving', 'little', 'town', 'Indiana', 'diner', 'where', 'comfortable', 'folks', 'come', 'eat', 'town', 'kind', 'place', 'where', 'people', 'care', 'other', 'Tom', 'Edie', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'love', 'can', 'act', 'out', 'erotic', 'fantasies', 'middle', 'age', 'are', 'first', 'time', 'course', 'Edie', 'cheerleader', 'really', 'cute', 'sexual', 'fantasy', 'are', 'middlest', 'middle', 'Americans', 'are', 'Tom', 'living', 'double', 'life', 'cover', 'blown', 'things', 'doing', 'good', 'deed', 'Now', 'irony', 'moment', 'moment', 'where', 'two', 'intrusive', 'animal', 'types', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'revealing', 'degrees', 'Tom', 'not-so-middle', 'American', 'background', 'also', 'Tom', 'movie', 'good', 'guy', 'mighty', 'man', 'indeed', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'escape', 'acts', 'out', 'Tom', 'bad', 'guy', 'Philly', 'who', 'been', 'trying', 'conceal', 'background', 'lead', 'new', 'scrubbed', 'clean', 'life', 'Indiana', 'Edie', 'kid', 'movie', 'Tom', 'confronts', 'then', 'literally', 'kill', 'vestiges', 'past', 'first', 'Carl', 'Forgarty', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'then', 'own', 'brother', 'Richie', 'William', 'Hurt', '.The', 'movie', 'kind', 'reverse', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'idyllic', 'apparently', 'happy', 'lifestyle', 'rent', 'apart', 'emergent', 'alpha', 'male', 'can', 'put', 'Eden', 'back', 'together', 'again', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'bifurcate', 'man', 'known', 'only', 'violence', 'thrust', 'Tom', 'Stall/Joey', 'Cusack', 'split', 'personality', 'one', 'wanted', 'dead', 'never', 'return', 'Once', 'again', 'however', 'violence', 'thrust', 'must', 'deal', 'first', 'someone', 'who', 'idyllic', 'life', 'who', 'wife', 'kids', 'then', 'journeying', 'gangster', 'hell', 'Philadelphia', 'heart', 'darkness', 'not', 'coincidence', 'Joey', 'must', 'kill', 'own', 'brother', 'finally', 'be', 'free', 'brother', 'course', 'bad', 'man', 'alter', 'ego', 'Mortensen', 'Bello', 'render', 'decent', 'performances', 'latter', 'was', 'rather', 'top', 'ways', 'true', 'stars', 'are', 'Harris', 'Hurt', 'whom', 'are', 'aided', 'however', 'playing', 'bad', 'guys', 'easier', 'pull', 'off', 'Mortensen', 'task', 'two', 'far', 'better', 'acting', 'job', 'Harris', 'who', 'extremely', 'convincing', 'Carl', 'Fogarty', 'Hurt', 'too', 'much', 'acting', 'schtick', 'baffles', 'audience', 'character', 'Indeed', 'Ritchie', 'kind', 'caricature.Fans', 'Cronenberg', 'will', 'rejoice', 'despair', 'movie', 'one', 'hand', 'Cronenberg', 'violence', 'peak', 'shocking', 'reality', 'can', 'not', 'fail', 'impress', 'However', 'had', 'resort', 'formula', 'here', 'do', 'more', 'artistic', 'trajectory', 'been', 'highjacked', 'least', 'waylaid.In', 'sum', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'reminiscent', 'other', 'older', 'movies', 'righteous', 'man', 'home', 'family', 'rank', 'great', 'films', 'True', 'Cronenberg', 'formula', 'degree', 'result', 'not', 'satisfying', 'truly', 'original', 'truly', 'Cronenberg']",N/A

After about a third of the movie devoted to tensely examining the mob's questions, it turns out that he indeed was Joey. Confrontations follow along with a great deal of domestic unrest as this little secret was now out in the open. It was an interesting confrontation pitting family values against one another in a somewhat unusual way.The movie was well done. I noted a few lapses in the story, but they were minor. The acting was excellent. The characters were believable, for the most part. The photography and sound were good. The pace never allowed boredom to set in.

960214,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B000CQLZ0Q,General Zombie,"[4, 9]","`A History of Violence' appears to be fairly controversial, not from a censorial perspective but an artistic one.  This comes as no surprise really, as here they've taken a fairly conventional story and presented it in an unconventional manner.  Some people, I think, have overrated the innovation of this film in terms of theme.  It's not as if no one has ever looked at the implications of violence from a more psychological perspective, and notions of whether or not it can ever be left behind.  In many ways this is simply `Unforgiven' set in a modern age.  What really makes this film so intriguing is how it approaches the situation in such a calm, everyday fashion.  Though you can doubtless point out many implausibilities in this film, there's no denying that, for me, this film has a sense of reality to it which is far greater than I've felt in  any other thriller I've seen.  This is, no doubt, why so many people dislike the film, as it is has a strange, ambling rhythm to it, and at the end it'll probably seem like not all that much has actually happened in the film.  I think this method works however, and helps to create a rather unique film.  That, and it is all just exquisitely crafted and well-acted.  Definitely one of the best films of 2005.David Cronenberg has almost always worked with characters that were outsiders if not outright freaks, and as an extension of this I think his films have generally felt kind of cold and distant.  Of the films of his that I've seen I think `A History of Violence' has by far the strongest human element.  We don't get to know these characters entirely, indeed one major point of the film is that they don't really know themselves, but I felt for them in a way that I never did for any of his other characters.  Cronenberg's films usually had enough interesting ideas to make them worthwhile anyway, but the human element elevates `A History of Violence', and makes it his best film.  (I'd put it ahead of `Videodrome' followed by `The Dead Zone', if anyone cares.The film opens, after the violent prologue, with a look at the everyday life of one Tom Stall in a small Indiana town.  His life, and the life of his family, is so ordinary and average that it almost verges on parody:  He works in a small diner, picking up litter outside the front door just prior to opening it; he consoles his daughter after she has a nightmare; his son, Jack, has problems with bullies and just sits around main street, watching the cars cruise back and forth etc.  The calm is interrupted late one night when a couple of murderous thieves come into the dinner, clearly planning on robbing the place and killing everyone inside.  Tom acts quickly and dispatches the thieves, and becomes a media sensation.  Trouble is, this attracts the attention of some ominous easterners, mafia types who claim to know that Tom isn't who he says he is, and that they have unfinished business.  And then things get really bad.Again, the film is unusual because it doesn't have a traditional plot arc: After the first major encounter the film doesn't slowly build, but rather intermixes significant encounters with the everyday lives of the Stalls.  These characters do not seem to be in a movie; these things begin to happen to them, but their life doesn't just stop, they move on and on, at least until it becomes impossible to do so.  The film refuses to show it's cards:  One day Tom sees the gangsters car drive away from his diner, and alerts his wife rushes home to find that nothing has happened at all.  Conversely, the second major incident appears out of nowhere quite spontaneously, as does the final confrontation, Tom's apparently having decided that he simply can't run anymore, and must go face his past.The acting is uniformly excellent.  Viggo Mortensen is very good as Tom, exuding a small-town charm and simplicity that is utterly believable.  Maria Bello is even better as his wife, and should've been nominated for an Oscar.  She's got the most flashy role, as her performance is a veritable emotional roller coaster, but she makes it all fly.  I also particularly like Ed Harris as Fogarty, the scarred leader of the gangsters who come to town.  He's deliciously ominous and evil, yet you can't help but like him a little.  William Hurt is also good as the big boss behind it all, though I've gotta wonder about his Oscar nomination.  He definitely plays the role very nicely, but I'm not sure it's substantiative enough to even deserve nomination as a supporting role.  But whatever, he's certainly good which is all that really matter.Though this film isn't a conventional thriller it's still got quite a bit of killing which is nicely done.  The action scenes are sudden, both elegant and sloppy and really very gruesome much of the time.  I've seen plenty of horror films, I've seen a lotta gore, but this film allows a sort of intensity to the violence which is rarely matched else where, such as when we catch a glimpse of one thug whose face has been shredded by a bullet coming down through the back of his head, and another who has his nose shattered and driven up through his brain, limbs still trembling.  Needless to say, this film is not for the squeamish.The movie comes to a satisfyingly intense climax where all if finally revealed, but it ends on an ambiguous note.  This will doubtless disappoint some, and I've always felt that excess ambiguity is an easy way to appear provocative or intelligent, but I think it works here.  The film offers no cheap answers, and doesn't seem to be saying that 'You the audience must decide what happens next' but rather, 'I don't know where it goes from here.'  Besides, after all that has happened, what more is there to say?Grade: A",5,One of 05's Best,1143244800,"03 25, 2006",2006,5741,"['History', 'Violence', 'be', 'fairly', 'controversial', 'not',

Katsaros,"[106, 152]","David Cronenberg in his most mainstream film gives us the adaptation of the graphic novel of the same name.This film questions on the how far you will go to use violence to protect your family and how deep its connection with all of us.As we all know its human nature.The film is fairly close to the graphic novel with minor little differences like for example names have been changed,also the town's name plus there are a couple of sex scenes that are not in the book.As the film starts we meet two bad guys in the middle of nowhere that cause the whole plot to unravel for Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) and his lawyer wife (Maria Bello) and his two kids Jack (Ashton Holmes) and Sarah (Heidi Hayes).While the two men are on the way to the small Indiana town that Tom lives.We see how life is in a small town and for Stall family.Its quiet, no fuss and hassels.Everyone knows everyone its most of the time a nice and quiet to live.While Tom and Eddie are ending a night in their diner that they own the two bad guys we saw in the start arrive.As they attempt to rob the place and threaten the people inside Tom in self defense kills both of them and saves the day.Now the hero,the event is all over the news.This as a event brings attention to mobster Fogarty.He believes Tom is a guy called Joey that he new from Philadelphia.This endangers the whole family.As Fogarty kind of stalks the family for Tom to reveal truth of who he really is.Is he Joey with Mafia connections or really Tom and its just a minor misunderstanding.Every great film needs a great cast.Viggo Mortensen as Tom is one of his best roles yet.As a family man,husband and somewhat violent man Viggo is just great.Maria Bello in a great performance that will get her a Oscar nomination and already a Golden Globe nomination.Ed Harris is very good at playing the mean and stalking Fogarty.And last William Hurt.His part not that big,but its one of those performances that you just cant forget.He might get a nomination for a Oscar but its still not for sure.This film asks the questions of what kind of history of violence do we have or anybody else has.Do you really know a another person.What person he truly is.And where is the limit of using violence to survive.And to protect those closes to you.And you can go also to the Darwinian sense the survival of the fittest.Also I cant forget even though that this film is Cronenberg's most mainstream film this does have Cronenberg touches everywhere.From the blood that has his touches for being quick,unexpected and disgusting for some people but its needed.And how he deals with characters to the fullest so we can understand them and feel in danger with them.Also the sex scenes in the film are needed to show the connection between the character's and their love and trust that they have.On the DVD the film will be presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen,with both a English Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1 tracks.Extras will include a feature commentary by director David Cronenberg,a deleted scene with commentary by director David Cronenberg, a documentary called Acts of Violence and a Violence's History: United States Version vs. International Version featurette.Ending the special features will be an Unmaking of Scene 44 featurette, a Too Commercial for Cannes featurette, and a theatrical trailer for the film.This is one of the best films of 2005.Almost on every list of the top ten films of 2005 by critics and already nominated for many awards.This is one of Cronenberg's best films next to The Fly as his best in my opinion.Plus this a New Line Platinum Edition that tells you one thing that this DVD is going to be worth the buck.",5,Tom Stall had the perfect life... until he

There are a couple gruesome scenes accentuated by make-up and prosthetics, but they are quick and not enough to make you cringe or jump out of your seat. The DVD extras attempt to explain that the movie was trying to highlight how violence is reenforced and widely accepted in America, but there is no indication of this at all. This is purely a character drama with a few violent scenes.At it's basic core, this story is about a small town family who has to come to grips with a member's checkered past.  I give Viggo props for playing the part of a man who hid his past so well that even he believed in his new identity, but the gentle side of his character seemed a little too gentle.What had long been talked about in the media was the explicit and violent sex scene between Viggo and Maria Bello's character.

960220,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000CQLZ0Q,Grady Harp,"[4, 10]","David Cronenberg has a style with his films that is unmistakable: he is unafraid to address the darker aspects that lie within us all.  That he pushes this idea over the limits of viewable film is reflected in some of his popular films such as 'Dead Ringers', 'The Fly', 'Spider', 'eXistenZ', 'Naked Lunch' etc.  Yet despite his apparent love of gore he drives home a point that should be considered.  Most of the time he works with a good script.  For A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE he is hampered by one of the most pedestrian, hackneyed, adolescent scripts trying to pass as a big time movie - Josh Olson's adaptation of the grisly pulp novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke.Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) is introduced to us as the head of a Hallmark happy-wappy family in Indiana - with his wife Edie (Maria Bello), son Jack (Ashton Holmes) and daughter Sarah (Heidi Hayes).  Sure, Jack is harassed at school as a 'faggot' by a group of losers, but he takes it on the chin.  Tom owns a diner where everybody just loves him - until one day when a couple of thugs disturb the placid boredom of the place and end up dead at Tom's too facile hands.  Tom becomes a town hero, but the glow soon fades as big time crime enters in the guise of Fogarty (Ed Harris) plus thugs who enter the diner and confront Tom that he really is one Joey Cusack, a 'previous life' killer from Philadelphia.  Tension mounts and ultimately Tom kills the intruders only to come to grips with some realities that are threatening and unpleasant and turn his family 180 degrees against him (in one of the most absurdly written reversals of family commitment ever written) in a fraction of a second.  The rest is resolution of the Joey Cusack enigma and then the film just stops.The actors try to make this mess work but the lines they are required to murmur are just too bad to digest.  But if you like gore and battered bodies and spree killings and dark motives with secret agendas, then the film may please.  But how it got attention in the first place is a bit difficult to believe.  The accompanying featurettes on the DVD show all the secrets behind the gore and include scenes eventually deleted for good reason.

This time he chooses to makea violent, but powerful acted and character driven movie called ""A History of Violence"".""A History of Violence"" has a very familiar storyline that some ignorant audience members might use an excuse to not see the movie, but boy would they be missing out on a great movie!!!!Yes the story is nothing new in today's time, a guy living the normal life has a past that he doesn't want to reveal and has been hiding. Then during one instance, in a life or death situation, his identiy is revealed.The story then has Viggo Mortensen (in perhaps his best role since the Lord of the Ring movies) as Tom  Stall who is the owner of a small restaurant/coffee shop. He and his wife both work side by side. He has two great kids, one daughter and older son. He has everything a guy could want then one day, a group of lowlifes try to rape an employee and thus he springs to action. Like a hired killer, Tom disposes of these trash quite easily. He is labeled in the media as hero, and while Tom enjoys this and thinks none of it, an old friend is watching.Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris, who is equally great in this movie) comes looking for Tom. His wife Edie Stahl and Tom don't recognize him. Carl eventually tells us all about Tom's ratherelusive history. It seems that the guys Tom wasted are aligned to the mafia, and that Carl is their ""main"" guy.Carl thinks Tom is actually some guy named Joey from his crew. Of course Tom doesn't recall him or so we think.

960228,A3RFXU3P0XKKF4,B000CQLZ0Q,"Herbert L Calhoun ""paulocal""","[1, 4]","This movie as a metaphor of American society is to the art of cinema what a Miles Davis or John Coltrane composition is to music, or a Kaiga painting is to Japanese art, or an unexpected winning Bobby Fischer or Bent Larsen move is to chess. Its very power lies in the utter subtlety and understatement of its intrusive imaginative truths, and in the skill and necessity with which these truths are forced out into the open and acted out as an unerring narrative (or drama) about what lies underneath the human and the American condition. And what lies beneath it is the manifold terror of violence -- which is an enduring, ugly, almost inexorable existential subtext and leitmotif of the human - and especially of the American way of life.There is no longer a need to get excited about violence in the U.S., for in its many and various sublimated forms it is to be found everywhere. We are trained not to see it but it is always there: in our national bloodstream, in our collective DNA, in our fantasies, in our passive-aggressive natures. All of its multi-layered, multidimensional, and hydra-headed components emerge and intersect in subtle ways in this movie. It is in our past, in our present, and sure to be in our future. It is the grim reaper of American society. The movie shows how violence stalks us from every dark corner of our consciousness. First it is far away and buried deep in our past; then it is close up, intimate, and then from out of nowhere it is suddenly ""in our faces."" It is in our homes, our cities and on our farms. There is no way to insulate ourselves from it, or hide from it. Indeed it is within us; it oozes from our skins. It is in our children heads. As domestic terrorists and meth-amphetamine labs, it is in our pastoral rural communities too.With uncommon skill, depth and subtlety, this movie demonstrates that in the U.S., no one is ever far away from either the next ""staged"" or the next ""random act"" of violence. Our lives are centered on and shaped not by what we pretend is the main problem, ""violence in the streets"", but on how to avoid the structural violence implicit in the very American condition: The movie makes clear that the center of gravity of violence in our society is the passive aggressive violence closer to home in our own minds. Our conscious lives are no longer regulated by or animated by violent acts per se, but by how best to pretend there is no violence inherent in the American condition. And that, to the extent we are willing to admit to this at all, that we are animated by the lie that its cumulative historical impact on us, that is on who we are, and on our way of thinking and acting, and on our community as a whole, has nothing at all to do with how violent our society is, has become, and has always been. That is to say, it is about the continuing lie that past violence has no present day consequences.We keep telling ourselves in so many different ways that all of this homegrown American violence is external to the American condition: that it has nothing to do with America's ugly accumulated history of violence. All these images of America being a violent land, is just so much anti-American propaganda working overtime. This image of us as being a violent nation is a mirage, a figmentation of overly active and fertile imaginations, a pure anomaly, an aberration completely alien to, and having nothing to do with the American condition. Yet, each morning, we cannot trust our own neighbors enough not to walk our kids to the corner school bus stop. To do otherwise is to risk the chance that they will be abducted, raped and murdered by the nearest local sexual predator. And oddly enough, the statistics bare us out on taking this profoundly prudent defensive measure.As the movie underscores, every American instinct is an instinct whistling pass our own self-made graveyard, with one foot in a camp of colossal collective denial about how violence has not colonized our very existence; and the other attributing what violence there is to safe acceptable but far away targets -- ""distanced"" so that they do not contaminate our pristine thoughts of ourselves. It does not matter much that the character ""Joey"" or ""Tom Stall"" (superbly played by Viggo Mortensen), had a violent past, for as Americans, we all know that we too all also have a collective violent past, the one defined by the trail of violence left in the wake of our nation's violent history. To wit:There is the unspeakable and psychologically still unresolved genocide against Native Americans, slavery and the still unresolved century of violence against the Negro (a half century of Apartheid and segregation, Jim Crow and lynching, and now voluntary re-segregation) that still shapes and animates the social lives of all Americans; a Civil War that the South lost on the battlefield but actually won in the hearts and minds of most white Americans, and which is still being fought just beneath the American consciousness, labor and race riots from the early 1800s forwards; two world wars, and a series of lesser ones -- from Vietnam to Panama and Grenada, and now on to Afghanistan and Iraq -- and the wars within the organized crime underworld that have become a signature of the American way of life.Then there are the perpetual, unending wars: wars on drugs, on terror and on the poor, that is the class and culture wars; and of course within them, the war against abortions, the war between the rice and the poor, and always, the wars against the Jews and the Zionists. And then there is the war of the corporations against the rest of us - especially the oil and drug companies - not to mention just plain raw violence as in ""domestic in-the-home-violence,"" continued racial violence, prison violence, and an annual crop of serial killers; street crime -- dope, whores, drive-by shootings, gang revenge, 7/11 stick-ups, mob violence and cop killings - an epidemic of sexual predators, killers and abductors, school, job and restaurants mass killings, and political assassinations, to name just a few.America has not only been colonized by its own homegrown history of violence, but has been shocked into a perpetual fearful defensive state of existence. It has been defined and shaped by, then numbed by, and now collectively compartmentalized by, its casual ability to accept its own homegrown violence. Today, any political demagogue who can make 911 the predicate of a sentence, no matter how incompetent or illiterate, is surely to be elected U.S. President.But even knowing that this is our history, the movie demonstrates with disturbing skill that somehow we still have learned to live in a cocoon of self-imposed denial, a virtual mental Potemkin village. We have trained ourselves to compartmentalize as Edie (Maria Bello) who played the role of ""Joey's"" wife, was forced to do. And thus we have become numb to the pervasiveness of the violence that is an integral part of us, and our ethos. As a nation, we have crawled into the fetal position, waiting to be rescued from ourselves by some imaginary moral hero. It seems we have no choice but to endure, deny and accept our lot; and then try to live through the denial of the knowledge that we have created the very incubator for our own self-destructive and violent society.The great irony of U.S. society, which this movie draws out in the only way good art is supposed to do -- with great subtlety and understatement - is that we only become animated; act surprised; we only react when violence shows up uninvited (that is unforced from the subconscious) at the dinner table of a well-adjusted, white, suburban, middle-class, Middle American family. For instance, as the BTK killer did at the geographic center of America, Kansas, where not coincidentally the movie was situated. Or, as Ted Kaczynski did at the idyllic foothills of the Montana mountains. Or indeed as Timothy Mc Veigh did in the bombing of the Murrah Building ""in out-of-the-way"" Oklahoma City.) Otherwise ""the violence that we see and (that we are)"" ceases to be real to us.After this subtle, understated, David Cronenberg movie, ""The History of Violence,"" we no longer have the comfort zone of taking the national fetal position and waiting to be rescued. For those with the courage to see it, he has shaken and disturbed this nation's conscience to it very core. His art reverberated deep inside the brain. It is a scary truth that sticks there. It cannot be easily expelled, ejected or excommunicated.The very act of raising this hidden truth openly -- especially about the cumulative violence of the past - will undoubtedly be seen, by those willing to see, as an unpatriotic betrayal of the highest order. Put simply, to admit to ourselves that our society rests on an edifice of violence, structural and otherwise that is then covered up by denials and lies; is to admit that violence is the only true and enduring constant in the American way of life. This, in the end, is an intolerable truth and an almost unbearable betrayal of the deepest held national unconscious secret.  Yet it is a truth from which we can no longer recoil, shrink and then hide.  It takes, not just an extraordinary artist, but a great artist, to be able to drill this message back into the brain-dead and morally challenged American conscience as David Cronenberg has done. One does not get hit with the full force of the message until long after he has left the theater: and then boom, like a ton of bricks you are shaken forever!That important truths such as this, ""that the psychological impact accumulated violence has had on the American psyche"" can only be told through the most sophisticated and carefully coded art forms, shows in devastating relief how fragile the American way of life has become. Teetering as it does on a thin precipice of proto-Fascist political maneuverings and rumblings, self-styled hero worshipping, and on a thick veneer of pretend humanity, all of which is backup by state and societally-sanctioned violence or the threat of violence at every level, we are a nation rapidly spinning out of control and down into the vortex of full-scale Fascist-like tyranny.Fear, but especially the fear of violence, is forcing us to eat our young, and to consume our own democratic institutions. From the purse-snatching ghetto thugs, to organized crime, to intimidation by crooked street cops, their rent-a-cop auxiliaries and security mercenaries, to sexual predators, and inner city gang violence, to law enforcement officers that are supposed to defend us -- such as the IRS, CIA, DIA, FBI, Homeland Security, etc. -- by home-grown criminals and terrorists, and ultimately by the American military, we are slowly and almost imperceptively becoming the police state we keep telling ourselves we are not. Strangely all of these agencies mandated to defend us from violence against ourselves, are more and more beginning to look suspiciously like Nazis in Halloween masks, salivating while anxiously awaiting with their attack dogs, high voltage tasers, hollow-point bullets and automatic weapons for the last democratic restraints to be stripped away.This movie captures the full essence of the impact violence has had on contemporary American history both as it is played out ""one random act at a time,"" and as its accumulates, and is encapsulated as systemic and structural violence over an embarrassingly long period of time. And it does so in a way that is so subtle, so deep, so stunning, so honest, so original, so moving, and so economical that it staggers the imagination into silence.If there is a better American movie in history, I have not yet seen it.Fifty stars!",5,An artistic triumph of monumental proportions: An astounding work of Art rarely achieved in the American cinema.,1193875200,"11 1,

960229,A9I40WFF40R4,B000CQLZ0Q,"H. F. Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[2, 4]","Directed by David Cronenberg and starring Viggo Mortensen (Tom Stall), Maria Bello (Edie Stall), Ed Harris (Carl Forgerty) and a cameo performance by William Hurt (Richie Cusack), ""A History of Violence"" is as good as this kind of movie gets. Tom Stall, a mild-mannered family man with a wife and two children, runs a small diner in a small Midwestern town. His peaceful life is changed forever when he becomes a local and national hero after taking out two goons who try to rob him at gunpoint. Even if one had not seen the trailers for this movie previously, he would be suspicious of the shooting prowess of Stall. He and his family are soon visited by Carl Forgerty and company who accuse him of being someone else, Joey Cusack of Chicago. Much of the plot is predictable from this point forward as Stall has to deal with his past that he thought was buried forever. There is enough murder and gore to satisfy the most blood-thirsty of viewers. On the other hand, the film rises above the typical blood-and-guts crime movie as there are nice twists in the plot and the Stall family members to a person are real people that we care about, including the angelic daughter (Heidi Holmes) and her teenaged brother (Ashton Holmes) who has his own violent streak to contend with. The ending is really quite moving.There is some terrific acting here by Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello and Ed Harris and the small but dynamite performance by Willaim Hurt as Tom/Joey's brother Richie.

960230,A457S8SW690NM,B000CQLZ0Q,hi,"[1, 2]","I finally got to see this wonderful masterpiece and absolutely adored it. It blew away my already very high expectations. Yet even as I left the theater and thought about this wonderful movie, I heard people saying that it sucked horribly. I am afraid that a lot of people will feel that way. Why? Becauseit progresses very slowly and therefore is relaistic. The characters might stare at each other for 5 minutes straight because mr. Croenberg wanted to make a realistic movie. All of the violence is incredibly realistic and very gruesome.The movie is about family man Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen), a bartender in a small town in Indiana who has a beautiful wife (Maria Bello) and a little girl and an older boy. The movie at first shows how well this family gets along and how much they love each other. But, that quickly changes during one seemingly ordinary night at the bar. Two very aggressive men walk into the bar and threathen everyone in it with guns. When one of them is about to kill a waitress, Tom reacts with feline instincts, taking out the two men. He is pronounced a hero and is followed around by countless reporters. Yet, he is strangely weird about it. When a man comes into town addressing Tom by Joey and calling him someone he really isn't..right?What follows is a remarquable film with very sad moments but that also has very funny moments. I got attached to the characters and supported them. The cast is brilliant with Viggo Mortensen and Maria Bello great and with supporting actors Ed Harris and William Hurt FANTASTIC! These two actors add so much to the movie notably Hurt in the end who delivers great dark humor.The movie also has two sex scenes which are actually important to the movie. The first is sweet, lovable, and humorous but the second is brutal and savage showing an abrupt transformation in the relationship between the couple. Yet, I do have a regret that these scenes went on for that long. That was unnecessary and movies lately have been getting too sexual. And the one scene where Tom's wife comes out of the shower, full front naked, what was that about. Nevertheless, movies this good don't come along that often.A history of violence is probably the best movie that I have ever seen because it made me think, and allowed me to connect with characters and witness wonderful acting.

Sometimes his efforts are stupendously successful, and sometimes they fall flat.  This one is definitely in the ""successful"" end of the spectrum.  As much as a two-hour movie can, it addresses such questions as:*  Can you escape or change your nature?(Answer: yes, because Viggo Mortensen's Tom Stall's past and past nature would never have come to light but for coincidence.)*  What is the extent of forgiveness?(Answer: quite broad.)*  What would you do to protect your family?(Answer: anything.)*  How should we confront evil?(Answer: reluctantly but without hesitation, without mercy, and without a second thought.)I suppose I especially liked the film because by and large I agree with Mr. Cronenberg's answers.  I cannot condemn those who give the film only one or two stars however, because there is some merit to their complaints.  The movie is not without its flaws, foremost in my opinion being the cliched view of small-town life that Cronenberg imagines.My recommendation: buy or rent the DVD if you're interested in the questions Cronenberg answers, and you won't be disappointed.",4,Who are we?,1144454400,"04 8, 2006",2006,1259,"['David', 'Cronenberg', 'outer', 'edges', 'humanity', 'e.g.', 'Scanners', 'reality', 'e.g.', 'Naked', 'Lunch', 'Dead', 'Ringers', 'movies', 'practice', 'here', 'Sometimes', 'efforts', 'are', 'stupendously', 'successful', 'sometimes', 'fall', 'flat', 'one', 'definitely', 'successful', 'end', 'spectrum', 'As', 'much', 'two-hour', 'movie', 'can', 'such', 'questions', '*', 'Can', 'escape', 'change', 'nature', 'Answer', 'yes', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'past', 'past', 'nature', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'come', 'light', 'coincidence', '*', 'What', 'extent', 'forgiveness', 'Answer', 'quite', 'broad', '*', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'protect', 'family', 'Answer', 'anything', '*', 'How', 'should', 'confront', 'evil', 'Answer', 'reluctantly', 'hesitation', 'mercy', 'second', 'thought', 'suppose', 'especially', 'liked', 'film', 'large', 'agree', 'Mr.', 'Cronenberg', 'answers', 'can', 'not', 'condemn', 'who', 'give', 'film', 'only', 'one', 'two', 'stars', 'however', 'merit', 'complaints', 'movie', 'not', 'flaws', 'foremost', 'opinion', 'being', 'cliched', 'view', 'small-town', 'life', 'Cronenberg', 'imagines.My', 'recommendation', 'buy', 'rent', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'interested', 'questions', 'Cronenberg', 'answers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

An abnegate father of family will receive the unexpected visit of some guys of the underworld who identify with another name.The story is clearly exposed in three movements; in the first we will witnesses the existential parallelism between his violent response to the first sudden incursion in his grocery and the way his own son reacts against the violence of  a teenager who really disturbs him twice before the hidden rage; the second movement is the unmasking fact about his real identity before his wife and his son  and finally the conclusion, the final solution.The progressive psychological deconstruction and psychological reconstruction obeys to a necessity of self redemption.

Taking both men down makes him a hero to the small Indiana town in which he lives and to the news media nationwide.  Wounded in the action, he recovers by going back to his life and downplaying what he did.  But a history of violence can't be ignored forever.Carl Fogarty and two men arrive from Philadelphia accusing Tom of being Joey Cusack, the man who took Carl's eye over a decade before.  Tom denies it, but Carl will not be denied.  He threatens Tom's children and wife and this Tom cannot allow.  That situation dealt with, and before anything can even gain a semblance of the old normality, Joey's brother Richie calls from Philly, inviting Joey to come see him.  His motive isn't brotherly love.As things went from bad to worse, Tom's wife Maria Bello doubts him, his teenage son rebels, and the sheriff wants to know the truth.  Tom continues being his gentle self, telling Edie that Joey has been dead for a long time.SPOILER:  The remarkable thing about this story and Mortenson's performance is the fine but hard line drawn between Tom and Joey.  Try as Tom might to remain the small-town husband and father and businessman, when the need arrives to protect himself and his family, Joey Cusack is willing and able to do whatever is necessary.  Writing, direction, and performances are all topnotch and the personal agony of the Stalls family is there for all to see.

Don't worry about any spoilers in this review because you'll thank me for avoiding this pseudo intellectual, pompous, disjointed yarn of uninteresting fodder.Opening scene: boring. No, it doesn't build to anything accept a child being shot which you don't see. Two bad guys rob a motel and kill the desk clerks. No action, you don't see anything and there's no reason to fill in the blanks because even though you think this movie will be about Tom Stall defending the town against these bad guys, wrong, because they both die 10 minutes later. Switch to plot ""B""...Stall's Diner where the bad guys show up. Will our hero defend his store with a climactic shoot'em up in act three? No. Bang, bang, they're dead and it's over with deadly expertise. Is our central character a sympathetic secret agent trying to retire to a new life? A member of the witness protection program, hiding, trying to protect his wife and two lovely children? Someone we can at least like? Someone we can root for? No, no, no because he continues to lie about his true identity to the entire town including his wife and family, nice guy. Don't like him already. Switch to plot ""C""...So now the mob from Philadelphia shows up having seen Tom Stall on the news from his heroic actions and IDs him as a mob enforcer from Philly. Ed Harris as Carl Fogarty is lame as the bad guy with the bogus eye. So THIS is the new plot. Tom Stall battles these mob guys defending his wife and family to the bitter end in act three. No...10 minutes later Stall kills two of them, the third dieing at the hands of Stalls' son Jack played by Ashton Holmes. The same son who originally appeared so mild and meek, then just pounded the living crap out of a school bully like he just turned on the kill switch. Switch to plot ""C""...Ah ha, the REAL plot. Does the apple fall far from the tree? Even though Tom was and still is at heart an unapologetic mob enforcer, has he passed those traits reluctantly on to his unsuspecting son? Is there any hope to prevent the son from revisiting the sins of the father? He seemed like such a nice boy at the beginning of the film. Wait, before we deal with that, let's have a pointless sex scene on the steps between Tom and his wife Edie who has finally come to he realization that Tom isn't the man she married and her life's been a lie but what the heck, bang, bang, bang, let's do it on the stairs! This is of course after the pointless and boring sex scene in the beginning of the movie with Edie dressed up as a cheerleader. Whatever. Oh my God, a husband and wife having sex. Ah now I understand everything now. Bad guys kill people. Shocking. Whatever. Now let's get back to the son's issues... too late. Switch to plot ""D""...But Wait! It's Richie Cusack, Tom's brother who Tom screwed over in Philly calling inviting Tom back for a powwow and off Tom goes without concern his for family who he's been valiantly protecting throughout the movie or even a reason for his departure. At this point, why anyone would care remotely about Tom and what happens to him is simply beyond me. The guy has been lying to his family and delivering some serious pain, murder and mayhem though the last 70 minutes of the movie in little vignettes of stylized violence in a sea of disjointed crap.So we're getting close to the end now. Tom shows up at his brother's place, they talk and Richie tries to have his goons take out Tom(no surprise). Bad idea as Tom cleans up the place with the hired help then blows the back of his brother's head off. How William Hurt gets nominated for his performance for anything but a Golden Raspberry is beyond me. What an uneven, unbelievable, unspectacular performance in his 5-7 minutes of screen time. He would have made a better career move by appearing in ""Lost In Space II: Danger, Will Hurt! Danger!""So Tom, returns home to his family at the diner table, his life turned upside down, which you don't really care about the guy anyway. He sits down at the table and no one speaks to him. The End. And this is not a Dustin Hoffman/Katherine Ross in the back of the bus in 'The Graduate' ""What have we done"" end, no, just the end, whatever.I don't know what kind of political/moral agenda driven crap David Cronenberg and Viggo Mortensen had in mind here because this movie is simply uninteresting and doesn't really make any sense. And don't think for a second that you're not part of the intellectual entertainment illuminati and just missing the point. No, this movie is just crap.

There is a final phase of violence, like the showdown in Westerns, only a 21st century version. The film captures the principle that `less is more'.

Then enters Carl Fogerty (Harris); a mob guy who is convinced Tom Stall is in fact Joey from Philadelphia (an organized killer).

The rhythm is always extremely slow, nearly realistic, and accelerations are rare and always motivated by some moment of violent explosion. Violence itself is shown so coldly that it becomes some kind of simple and ordinary action hardly different from having cornflakes for breakfast. But the really original dimension of the film is the fact that Cronenberg is not telling us a story but is speaking of the History of violence in a family, in society. The two brothers share the great propensity to use violence. Normal, they are brothers. One tries to evade this violent History but he can't. Sooner or later he goes back to it. Violence is never forgotten, lost. Circumstances will take care of that. Worse, the son of one of these brothers is depicted as a non-violent person and yet one day he will know, without any initiation, how to beat up and defeat three bullies who are quite bigger than he is and a lot more trained in the field. He will naturally know how to do it... naturally, it will come from his History, his genes in other words. This is extremely pessimistic about humanity, and yet...

But I'm glad I picked it up.  Basically the plot revolves around Tom, a small town diner owner, who obviously cares about the appearance of his town (he picks up rubbish in the street) and the people who live there.  He's got a nice wife, a young daughter and a teenage son, a perfect family life if you will.  Then one day a couple of thugs walk into his diner when it is closing and demand service.  We viewers from a previous scene know these guys aren't there to eat and its not long before the other diners also work out theirs lives are probably going to end shortly.  But these violent killer thugs picked the wrong diner.  Now Tom's a reluctant celebrity, but his experience with violence doesn't look to be over when a disfigured man and his entourage enter the diner and insist his name is Joey.  Tom of course tells them their mistaken, but these mob guy's don't seem to think so.  Is this just a case of mistaken identity?  Was Tom someone else before he met his wife and had his kids?  What is a family to do when the mob guys just won't leave town and keep insisting Tom is Joey.This book is based on a graphic novel by John Wagner, I've never read that or any of his work but the storyline reminded me of a good Dave Zeltserman novel.  I quite liked the movie, of course you wonder why the mob guy doesn't just shoot him when he thinks he's Joey instead of playing the games he does, but we wouldn't have a movie then would we?  The DVD needed better artwork on the cover though to do this movie justice, it just looks amateur league to me that way it is.

960247,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B000CQLZ0Q,Jason,"[1, 2]","The legacy of vigilante justice movies like Death Wish lives on for one primary reason: we love to cheer for the everyman and we are sick of the scum never being visited by karma.  Nobody wants to see the captain of the football team bed the cheerleading captain in the back of his rich lawyer father's BMW.  Similarly, there is no desire to learn about a complete social leech preying on others and never receiving a comeuppance.  All of this is why History of Violence is so awesome.As a hard working, small business owner in Millbrook, IN, Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) is, outwardly at least, a humble American whose work ethic is the foundation on which the country succeeds and progresses.  He lives a quiet life with his wife Edie (Bello), his son Jack (Holmes), and his young daughter Sarah (Hayes).  When a few thugs with intentions of senseless violence walk into Stall's diner, the world of Millbrook changes.  Immediate media notoriety transforms Stall into an unwilling hero, putting his face on televisions nationwide, and unravels a mysterious past tied to Philadelphia organized crime.In this first pairing of director David Cronenberg and Viggo Mortensen, a combo that would later produce the awesomeEastern Promises, we are presented morality lessons in a seldom seen world that is teeming with ruthless killers.  A world where men like Carl Foggerty (Ed Harris), a scarred villain, ostensibly the scariest hitman that could be sent, are sent to tie up loose ends like those in Millbrook.  Little does anyone know, Foggerty isn't in town for revenge; he's in town for Stall...except he keeps calling Stall by the name Joey Cusack.The levels of violence in this film are deeply intertwined.  Not only is the aspect of revenge present, an idea that violence can and should be used to solve disputes (especially when confronted with a situation that restricts diplomatic approaches) but also the Darwinian ""survival of the fittest"" concept.  How violence begets violence, and lives are molded by the acting violently as well as being placed in a violent situation.  Mortensen is brutal as Stall, changing from mild-mannered to savage in an instant; although, the depiction of his transformation is spliced with reluctance.  With Stall's somber, conclusive act, Cronenberg gives resonance to the positive importance of family, and provides hope that a history of violence can be overcome by a recent history of love (and an entrancing bedroom scene between Viggo and Bello).This movie is critically acclaimed, full of tension, and highly recommended!Jason Elin",5,I KNEW I should have gone to Denny's!,1261958400,"12 28, 2009",2009,2572,"['legacy', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'movies', 'Death', 'Wish', 'one', 'primary', 'reason', 'love', 'cheer', 'everyman', 'are', 'sick', 'scum', 'never', 'being', 'visited', 'karma', 'Nobody', 'see', 'captain', 'football', 'team', 'bed', 'cheerleading', 'captain', 'back', 'rich', 'lawyer', 'father', 'BMW', 'Similarly', 'desire', 'learn', 'complete', 'social', 'leech', 'preying', 'others', 'never', 'receiving', 'comeuppance', 'why', 'History', 'Violence', 'so', 'awesome.As', 'hard', 'working', 'small', 'business', 'owner', 'Millbrook', 'IN', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'outwardly', 'least', 'humble', 'American', 'work', 'ethic', 'foundation', 'country', 'quiet', 'life', 'wife', 'Edie', 'Bello', 'son', 'Jack', 'Holmes', 'young', 'daughter', 'Sarah', 'Hayes', 'When', 'few', 'thugs', 'intentions', 'senseless', 'violence', 'walk', 'Stall', 'diner', 'world', 'Millbrook', 'changes', 'Immediate', 'media', 'notoriety', 'Stall', 'unwilling', 'hero', 'putting', 'face', 'televisions', 'nationwide', 'mysterious', 'past', 'tied', 'Philadelphia', 'organized', 'crime.In', 'first', 'pairing', 'director', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'combo', 'would', 'later', 'produce', 'awesomeEastern', 'Promises', 'are', 'presented', 'morality', 'lessons', 'seldom', 'seen', 'world', 'teeming', 'ruthless', 'killers', 'world', 'where', 'men', 'Carl', 'Foggerty', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'scarred', 'villain', 'ostensibly', 'scariest', 'hitman', 'could', 'be', 'sent', 'are', 'sent', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'Millbrook', 'Little', 'anyone', 'know', 'Foggerty', ""n't"", 'town', 'revenge', 'town', 'Stall', 'calling', 'Stall', 'name', 'Joey', 'Cusack.The', 'levels', 'violence', 'film', 'are', 'deeply', 'intertwined', 'Not', 'only', 'aspect', 'revenge', 'present', 'idea', 'violence', 'can', 'should', 'be', 'used', 'solve', 'disputes', 'especially', 'when', 'confronted', 'situation', 'diplomatic', 'approaches', 'also', 'Darwinian', 'survival', 'fittest', 'concept', 'How', 'violence', 'begets', 'violence', 'lives', 'are', 'molded', 'acting', 'violently', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'placed', 'violent', 'situation', 'Mortensen', 'brutal', 'Stall', 'changing', 'mild-mannered', 'savage', 'instant', 'depiction', 'transformation', 'spliced', 'reluctance', 'Stall', 'somber', 'conclusive', 'act', 'Cronenberg', 'resonance', 'positive', 'importance', 'family', 'hope', 'history', 'violence', 'can', 'be', 'overcome', 'recent', 'history', 'love', 'entrancing', 'bedroom', 'scene', 'Viggo', 'Bello', '.This', 'movie', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'full', 'tension', 'highly', 'recommended', 'Jason', 'Elin']",N/A

960249,A2PIX2K56IZZYX,B000CQLZ0Q,Jason W. Kaiser,"[0, 3]","David Cronenberg has made some very memorable movies, Scanners will always be one of my favorite horror movies, and he also did The Dead Zone, and The Fly 1 and 2, also very good. Even when he makes a below-average movie, such as Dead Ringers or Crash (not the 5-star Oscar winner from last year, the 1996 soft-core film) He still manages to get the actors and actresses to perform brilliantly. History of Violence is no different, although not his best work, it is so well acted, that it makes you forget about the plot holes and the silly un-necessary scenes. It's actually the supporting actors that really did it for me, Viggo Mortensen is rather bland in the lead role, I felt he should have played it with much more emotion considering the elements he was surrounded by.Let me get into the supporting cast, they are stellar, top-notch performances, with two, in my opinion, worthy of best supporting actor and actress nominations. The first is Ed Harris, this man is definitely one of the better actors in film today. and he is at his evil best here, playing Carl Fogarty, co-founder of a very evil crime family, who is trying to get to Viggo's character for some double-crossings from there past. Viggo has gone clean, playing the good hubby/dad role but when he is seen on TV after foiling an attempted robbery at his restuarant, Harris show's up wanting revenge. The chemistry and tension between Viggo and Harris is sensational. Harris has a contempt in his voice and personality that just totally made his character. I know he has played in a couple of duds, but even then, the man always delivers.The second performance that was brilliant was by Maria Bello, you talk about intensity personified, she was absolutely incredible. If you thought she was remarkable in 'The Cooler' wait 'till you see her here. She plays Viggo's wife, unaware of her husbands dark past, she desparately tries to keep her family together even though they are being pusued by Harris and his goons through many cat and mouse like games and confrontations. I really felt for her character, and the hell she endures for them is nothing short of amazing.Now, incredible acting aside, I did have a couple of issues that didn't set well with me. Although I said Viggo's acting was average, Maria Bello made me totally believe how much these two were in love, I didn't need the silly love scene with the cheerleading outfit. Don't get me wrong, Bello is hot, and kinky sex scenes are part of Cronenberg's forte', but not necessary here. Then later on in the film after she finds out Viggo was lying and they have an intense fight, the violent sex they have during this fight was not needed, in fact, it made me feel dirty, like I needed a shower or something. I have read that a few viewers had trouble with the violence saying it was too graphic and, get this, real. Huh? are you kidding me? I thought it was done very well and was valid in telling the evil nature of the business they were in.Two other strong performances are by William Hurt as Viggo's brother and head of the crime family, and surprise, surprise, he is awesome as usual. A big surprise was the acting of Ashton Holmes, who plays Viggo's son, very strong and emotional. The scenes with him laying into his dad were very heart-felt and real. So, in all a pretty good movie, but don't watch it thinking you are going to get your usual body-count hero saves the day movie. Although there are some good action scenes and some great fighting scenes, overall its very dark and disturbing.

No. Run of the Mill? No. It's funny but I really can't find that one true word that sums up A History of Violence. Cronenberg's A History of Violence is very much akin to David Lynch's The Straight Story. Much of the crucial conversation in the film is non-existent but simply relies on the intuition of the viewer to fill in the blanks. In terms of Cronenberg this is by far his most commercial piece to date, I mean this is the guy who made Scanners. In terms of violence, there is some but nothing that will stick with you.  Viggo Mortensen turns in a steller performance as Tom Stall, a small town diner owner who foils a robbery at his diner by killing the two gunmen. The film is an obvious study of violence and it's duel nature. Why is violence glorified in some situations and villified in others? The line between the two is a razor's edge and Tom Stall has walked it. Ed Harris and John Hurt turn in good but brief performances and essentially Mortensen is the whole story here. Overall, if your looking to be shocked, look elsewhere but for a good, psychological character study check out A History of Violence.

The bad news is that they're inside the hero.""History"" is the story of Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen), who lives in a small town that's probably a lot like yours -- it definitely reminded me of where I grew up in Vermont. He lives happily with his wife Edie (Maria Bello) and his children Jack (Ashton Holmes) and Sarah (Heidi Hayes). He runs a diner surrounded by old friends, and the only unusual things about his life are the sex games his wife initiates, and the level of bullying Jack has to endure at school.This all changes when a pair of killers hold up the restaurant late one night. Tom dispatches them handily -- and mortally. His grateful friends praise him to the local news, and Tom is hailed as a hero, who modestly tries to get past all of it as soon as possible. This even inspires Jack to stand up to his bully, though in a way no one quite expected.Word continues to spread, and soon more come to visit - a group led by a scarred thug, Carl (Ed Harris), who claims that Tom is in fact someone else entirely, someone who has other obligations. It is up to Edie and Jack to decide which of Tom's lives is the true one.Much of this is familiar territory, but Mr. Cronenberg casts a fine shadow on the proceedings, especially in the first hour. The performances and storytelling are strong, evoking memories of the original ""Cape Fear"", another story of a family threatened by a father's past. ""History"" goes a step further by insinuating that the future is tainted as well, possibly beyond repair or redemption.The last half hour is less compelling. The events make sense in the scheme of the story, but the execution seems abrupt and lacking character interplay. William Hurt is especially jarring as Tom's brother Richie - his accent erratic, he seemed a poor choice for a such a coarse antagonist.

If your goal is to be entertained and have a few puzzling moments--and if you don't mind some horrendous murders happening very quickly every now and then--give it a go.  Otherwise, director David Cronenberg (who is brilliant but never quite reached the level of David Lynch, who he imitates too much)hit a real low point with this.The performance by Viggo Mortensen is fantastic and chilling as hell.  You literally cannot get a grasp on the essence of this kind and when you do just want to back off.  IS he a reformed, average, timid man who has undergone some inexplicable kind of internal transformation of his own accord, or is he a mafia psychopath in raging denial just waiting to froth over?  He is both in a way.Unfortunately this can't save the rest of the film, with embarrassingly obvious symbolism and a kind of schizoid confusion that should have been restricted to the characterization of Tom/Joey, not the sequencing of scenes and dialogue.The surreality Cronenberg attempts right from the beginning is interrupted by Tom/Joey's relationship with his wife and family.  It isn't intriguingly confusing, just annoying.  The scenes in which we see ""what lies beneath"" with Tom/Joey are frightening indeed and well done, yet the whole gangster bit comes across with about as much as reality as a film with James Cagney.Cronenberg is trying to make some kind of commentary on Americans and their attraction/repulsion to violence but it doesn't succeed because it is too short and too mediocre.  This isn't ""Dead Ringers"" or even ""Mulholland Drive"" where you don't understand anything and then, day by day, you begin to understand it and watch it repeatedly.  It isn't that rich.

Shortly after he's all over the news, some mobsters come along saying he's not who he says he is. Ed Harris is creepy as the head of the mobsters who won't leave Tom and his family alone. He claims Tom is really a former mobster named Joey Cusack that took his eye with barbed wire. William Hurt who's usually sort of wooden gives his most lively performance in a supporting role as a mobster as well.Maria Bello is solid as Tom's wife who's trying to deal with the fact that her whole marriage could be a lie. I mean she thinks she married an innocent nice guy who wouldn't hurt a fly. Then finds out she may have married and had kids with a mobster who may have killed a lot people in the past. Ashton Holmes is also really good as Jack Satll, who's used to just letting the school bully pick on him and getting out of it by wussing out and telling jokes. When his dad becomes a local hero for the diner incident and showed his violent side Jack finds that he too has a violent side. By the end everyone is changed and everything is different for the Stall family than it was in the beginning. It's just a brilliant and gripping piece of work. I guess I shouldn't leave out that it's very bloody and violent as well.",5,Truly one of the best films of 2005,1142985600,"03 22, 2006",2006,1418,"['Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'dark', 'gripping', 'dramatic', 'film', 'family', 'man', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'who', 'life', 'worse', 'two', 'mad', 'men', 'defending', 'diner', 'Shortly', 'news', 'mobsters', 'come', 'along', 'saying', 'not', 'who', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'creepy', 'head', 'mobsters', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'Tom', 'family', 'alone', 'Tom', 'really', 'former', 'mobster', 'named', 'Joey', 'Cusack', 'took', 'eye', 'barbed', 'wire', 'William', 'Hurt', 'who', 'usually', 'sort', 'wooden', 'most', 'lively', 'performance', 'supporting', 'role', 'mobster', 'well.Maria', 'Bello', 'solid', 'Tom', 'wife', 'who', 'trying', 'deal', 'fact', 'whole', 'marriage', 'could', 'be', 'lie', 'mean', 'married', 'innocent', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'fly', 'Then', 'out', 'may', 'have', 'married', 'had', 'kids', 'mobster', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'killed', 'lot', 'people', 'past', 'Ashton', 'Holmes', 'also', 'really', 'good', 'Jack', 'Satll', 'who', 'used', 'just', 'letting', 'school', 'bully', 'pick', 'getting', 'wussing', 'out', 'telling', 'jokes', 'When', 'dad', 'local', 'hero', 'diner', 'incident', 'showed', 'violent', 'side', 'Jack', 'too', 'violent', 'side', 'end', 'everyone', 'changed', 'everything', 'different', 'Stall', 'family', 'was', 'beginning', 'just', 'brilliant', 'gripping', 'piece', 'work', 'guess', 'should', ""n't"", 'leave', 'out', 'very', 'bloody', 'violent', 'as', 'well']",N/A
960264,AOKKY21CAQVGM,B000CQLZ0Q,Jim&Yvonne,"[0, 9]","Poor Viggo.  There are actors that get huge breaks, like Viggo did with Lord of the Rings trilogy, but then flop (Hidalgo).  Then, he get's a role with a great concept with a director that has been in the business for a long time, but has not done any real work that would be considered great (most notably known for ""The Fly."").  Why did he (Viggo) get the role, he really isn't leading man quality-Probably  because of lower end salary and his ability to play a small town conservative good guy.  However, a gangster, no.  But when you think of it, who could of really played this role?  It is a very complex role, it would be tough for anyone to pull off.  This isn't a movie for ""A"" list stars, although I think Nicholas Cage has enough diversity to pull something like this off, so other than him, I really can not think of another person to do the film.  When you think of it, this movie was probably almost impossible to cast.  Maria Bella was excellent in the movie, Ed Harris and William Hurt were both very good, though their screen time was very limited.  Their accents?  I couldn't figure out what they were-They were supposed to be out of some crime family in Philadelphia.  Were they trying to be Italian, because that is just ridiculous or maybe they were trying for a New York accent-But why?.  I really am not sure about the mob deal.  I know you don't stereotype folks, but mobs are usually Italian, Russian or some Asian country and I am not sure what Mob ties they had.  Maybe I am just too big of a Sopranos fan.  At any rate, you can get a synopsis of the movie from Amazon.com.  I enjoyed it, Bella's performance was extremely good, Viggo's was sub-par.  The supporting cast was very good.  The movie is very violent (hence the name, History of Violence), so those that don't like violence, stay away.  When this movie was released, it was supposed to be an Oscar hopeful.  It was close, it had a great concept but just fell a bit flat with the leading man and some other casting issues and some holes in the script.  He (Viggo) could not pull off the duel personalities/hidden past part of his role-He just can not play a bad guy, although he did a good job pre-Lord of the Rings with G.I. Jane.  Summing up, it was an entertaining movie, it had many layers and the director really went out of mediocre past to direct probably the best film of his career, but it just did not have ""it.""  It was so close, maybe I am just not a Viggo fan, but Viggo, in my opinion was the ""it"" that kept this movie from reaching its full potential.  This movie has several sex scenes (nudity) and scenes of violence, therefore, keep the kiddies away and for those adults that don't dig the stuff above, keep away.  However, though, not the best, the movie was definitely not the worst due to a very slow year at the movies.  So, for 2005 movies, this movie still would fall in my top 10 of best movies despite all of its faults.",4,"So close, yet you lost me at the mob (3 1/2 stars)",1142467200,"03 16, 2006",2006,2934,"['Poor', 'Viggo', 'are', 'actors', 'get', 'huge', 'breaks', 'Viggo', 'did', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'then', 'flop', 'Hidalgo', 'Then', 'get', 'role', 'great', 'concept', 'director', 'been', 'business', 'long', 'time', 'not', 'done', 'real', 'work', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'great', 'most', 'notably', 'known', 'Fly.', 'Why', 'did', 'Viggo', 'get', 'role', 'really', ""n't"", 'leading', 'man', 'quality-Probably', 'lower', 'end', 'salary', 'ability', 'play', 'small', 'town', 'conservative', 'good', 'guy', 'However', 'gangster', 'when', 'think', 'who', 'could', 'really', 'played', 'role', 'very', 'complex', 'role', 'would', 'be', 'tough', 'anyone', 'pull', 'off', ""n't"", 'movie', 'A', 'list', 'stars', 'think', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'enough', 'diversity', 'pull', 'something', 'off', 'other', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'person', 'do', 'film', 'When', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'probably', 'almost', 'impossible', 'cast', 'Maria', 'Bella', 'was', 'excellent', 'movie', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'William', 'Hurt', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'screen', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'limited', 'accents', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'were-They', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'crime', 'family', 'Philadelphia', 'Were', 'trying', 'be', 'Italian', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'maybe', 'were', 'trying', 'New', 'York', 'accent-But', 'why', 'really', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'mob', 'deal', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'stereotype', 'folks', 'mobs', 'are', 'usually', 'Italian', 'Russian', 'Asian', 'country', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'Mob', 'had', 'Maybe', 'am', 'just', 'too', 'big', 'Sopranos', 'fan', 'rate', 'can', 'get', 'synopsis', 'movie', 'Amazon.com', 'enjoyed', 'Bella', 'performance', 'was', 'extremely', 'good', 'Viggo', 'was', 'sub-par', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'very', 'violent', 'hence', 'name', 'History', 'Violence', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'violence', 'stay', 'away', 'When', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'Oscar', 'hopeful', 'was', 'close', 'had', 'great', 'concept', 'just', 'fell', 'bit', 'flat', 'leading', 'man', 'other', 'casting', 'issues', 'holes', 'script', 'Viggo', 'could', 'not', 'pull', 'off', 'duel', 'personalities/hidden', 'part', 'role-He', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'play', 'bad', 'guy', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'pre-Lord', 'Rings', 'G.I', 'Jane', 'Summing', 'up', 'was', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'had', 'many', 'layers', 'director', 'really', 'went', 'mediocre', 'past', 'direct', 'probably', 'best', 'film', 'career', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'was', 'so', 'close', 'maybe', 'am', 'just', 'not', 'Viggo', 'fan', 'Viggo', 'opinion', 'was', 'kept', 'movie', 'reaching', 'full', 'potential', 'movie', 'several', 'sex', 'scenes', 'nudity', 'scenes', 'violence', 'therefore', 'keep', 'kiddies', 'away', 'adults', 'do', ""n't"", 'dig', 'stuff', 'keep', 'away', 'However', 'though', 'not', 'best', 'movie', 'was', 'definitely', 'not', 'worst', 'due', 'very', 'slow', 'year', 'movies', 'So', '2005', 'movies', 'movie', 'still', 'would', 'fall', 'top', '10', 'best', 'movies', 'faults']",N/A

In that sense, ""A History of Violence"" doesn't measure up. For all its harsh realistic depictions of violence, this story never seemed plausible as presented by the director, David Cronenberg.In piecing this film together, Cronenberg was often praised for his ""economy."" Not a wasted frame, more than one critic gushed.Excuse me, but add a few minutes to the runtime and plug some gaping holes in the plot. Like a previous Amazon reviewer, I can't believe Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensoe) would have been foolish enough, considering his history, to grant a single TV interview after his shoot-em-up in his little caf&eacute;. Then, supposedly the media sharks didn't come swimming back for more, in a far greater frenzy, after this ""quiet"" everyman has a second deadly gunfight - this time on his own front lawn with known gangsters. Hey, that's the kind of thing CNN, Fox, Inside Edition, Dateline, just might have noticed. And do you think the state police, FBI, someone beyond the local town sheriff might have, at that point in time, started taking a bigger interest in Tom, too?Secondly, the most intriguing aspect of the movie was the mystery surrounding Tom Stall's true identity. Once that mystery was revealed, far too swiftly, the movie loses steam - never mind what some might consider the steamy sex scene between Tom and wife Edie (Maria Bello) when she's apparently both repulsed and aroused by his history of violence.

""A History of Violence"" may be appropriately bloody and even messy, but for a movie striving for realism - to be more than a mindless action thriller that asks you to take leaps of faith and forgive plot twists that don't add up - it was absurdly illogical and, thus, terribly unsatisfying.",2,"More Plot Holes, Than Bullet Holes",1142553600,"03 17, 2006",2006,2225,"['measure', 'truly', 'great', 'movie', 'not', ""'d"", 'enjoy', 'watching', 'second', 'time', 'already', 'knowing', 'what', 'next', 'sense', 'History', 'Violence', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'harsh', 'realistic', 'depictions', 'violence', 'story', 'never', 'seemed', 'plausible', 'presented', 'director', 'David', 'Cronenberg.In', 'piecing', 'film', 'together', 'Cronenberg', 'was', 'often', 'praised', 'economy', 'Not', 'wasted', 'frame', 'more', 'one', 'critic', 'gushed.Excuse', 'add', 'few', 'minutes', 'runtime', 'plug', 'gaping', 'holes', 'plot', 'previous', 'Amazon', 'reviewer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'Viggo', 'Mortensoe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'foolish', 'enough', 'considering', 'history', 'grant', 'single', 'TV', 'interview', 'shoot-em-up', 'little', 'caf', 'eacute', 'Then', 'supposedly', 'media', 'sharks', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'swimming', 'back', 'more', 'far', 'greater', 'frenzy', 'quiet', 'everyman', 'second', 'deadly', 'gunfight', 'time', 'own', 'front', 'lawn', 'known', 'gangsters', 'Hey', 'kind', 'thing', 'CNN', 'Fox', 'Inside', 'Edition', 'Dateline', 'just', 'might', 'have', 'noticed', 'do', 'think', 'state', 'police', 'FBI', 'someone', 'local', 'town', 'sheriff', 'might', 'have', 'point', 'time', 'started', 'taking', 'bigger', 'interest', 'Tom', 'too', 'Secondly', 'most', 'intriguing', 'aspect', 'movie', 'was', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'true', 'identity', 'mystery', 'was', 'revealed', 'far', 'too', 'swiftly', 'movie', 'steam', 'never', 'mind', 'what', 'might', 'consider', 'steamy', 'sex', 'scene', 'Tom', 'wife', 'Edie', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'when', 'apparently', 'repulsed', 'aroused', 'history', 'violence', 'Personally', 'watched', 'on-the-stairs', 'mad', 'love', 'thing', 'happening', 'Tom', 'Edie', 'thinking', 'only', 'Hollywood', 'never', 'real', 'life', 'History', 'Violence', 'may', 'focus', 'man', 'primitive', 'side', 'inability', 'escape', 'truly', 'brutal', 'nature', 'lurking', 'civilized', 'facade', 'miserably', 'recognize', 'smart', 'audience', 'be', 'respected', 'being', 'logical', 'History', 'Violence', 'may', 'be', 'appropriately', 'bloody', 'even', 'messy', 'movie', 'striving', 'realism', 'be', 'more', 'mindless', 'action', 'thriller', 'take', 'leaps', 'faith', 'forgive', 'plot', 'twists', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'was', 'absurdly', 'illogical', 'thus', 'terribly', 'unsatisfying']",N/A
960273,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B000CQLZ0Q,Joseph Haschka,"[18, 20]","Not since STRAW DOGS (1971) have I seen a film that so strikingly makes the point that the capacity for violence is an inseparable part of the human condition. Even the meek inheriting the Earth have it - if pushed far enough.Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) and wife Edie (Maria Bello) live in a small mid-western town with teenage son Jack (Ashton Holmes) and young daughter Sarah (Heidi Hayes). The couple own, and Tom manages, a diner on Main Street. One night at closing, two psychopathic killers enter the eatery to rob the place and have some bloody fun. (We know they're psychopaths because the film's opening sequence shows them brutally murdering a family that owns a roadside motel.) As his waitress is about to be raped, Tom reacts in a way that would make Dirty Harry proud. The killers are rendered dead in pools of blood, coffee, and broken glass, and Tom, with his foot impaled by a knife, becomes a local hero that makes the national TV news. However, this notoriety draws out of the woodwork a scarred, Mafia hit man from Philadelphia, Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris), and a pair of associate thugs. Carl insists to Tom and Edie that the former is really Joey Cusack, a big city killer that tried to take out Carl's left eye with barbed wire. Tom, of course, denies that he's ever been to Philly. Edie believes her husband. At least she does until witnessing his reaction when Fogarty et al confront Tom on their front lawn after they kidnap Jack. Maybe Hubby has secrets, you think?At first, the audience believes that son Jack is a spineless wimp - until he's pushed too far in the hallway of his high school by a bully that's been tormenting him. (Is there an inheritable gene for mayhem, you might ask.) From all of us who've had sand kicked in our faces, way to go, kid! Even Edie isn't as turned off by violence as much as the thought that Tom has been lying to her all their married life. Indeed, an angry confrontation between the two escalates to a bout of consensual, frenzied sex that, while perhaps not ""rough"", was certainly uncomfortable and left bruises. (Is sex but low-level violence much as James Coburn's character in the 1967 comedy western WATERHOLE #3 called sex ""assault with a friendly weapon""?)Despite Tom's evident past, he's now a loving, committed father and husband and a solid, law abiding member of the community. OK, so he has a few lapses into old habits; they're all for good causes. As the very last scene infers, perhaps Edie can live with it. After all, she and her Hearth and Home are more stoutly defended by Tom's darker side than by some pacifist that wouldn't act until it's too late; other tribes should be so lucky.A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE is a gritty, well-acted, visual essay that neither condones nor condemns the potential for violence that exists in all of us. It's just there waiting in the tall grass to be called forth as needed, and there's no anguished, PC-inspired, hand-wringing about that fact. It's not the greatest film of 2005, but I liked it very much.",4,Bloodlust as part of the human condition,1130976000,"11 3, 2005",2005,3016,"['Not', 'STRAW', 'DOGS', '1971', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'so', 'strikingly', 'point', 'capacity', 'violence', 'inseparable', 'part', 'human', 'condition', 'Even', 'meek', 'inheriting', 'Earth', 'have', 'pushed', 'far', 'enough.Tom', 'Stall', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'wife', 'Edie', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'live', 'small', 'mid-western', 'town', 'teenage', 'son', 'Jack', 'Ashton', 'Holmes', 'young', 'daughter', 'Sarah', 'Heidi', 'Hayes', 'couple', 'own', 'Tom', 'manages', 'diner', 'Main', 'Street', 'One', 'night', 'closing', 'two', 'psychopathic', 'killers', 'enter', 'eatery', 'rob', 'place', 'have', 'bloody', 'fun', 'know', ""'re"", 'psychopaths', 'film', 'opening', 'sequence', 'brutally', 'murdering', 'family', 'roadside', 'motel', 'waitress', 'be', 'raped', 'Tom', 'way', 'would', 'make', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'proud', 'killers', 'are', 'rendered', 'dead', 'pools', 'blood', 'coffee', 'broken', 'glass', 'Tom', 'foot', 'impaled', 'knife', 'local', 'hero', 'national', 'TV', 'news', 'However', 'notoriety', 'woodwork', 'scarred', 'Mafia', 'hit', 'man', 'Philadelphia', 'Carl', 'Fogarty', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'pair', 'associate', 'thugs', 'Carl', 'Tom', 'Edie', 'former', 'really', 'Joey', 'Cusack', 'big', 'city', 'killer', 'tried', 'take', 'out', 'Carl', 'left', 'eye', 'barbed', 'wire', 'Tom', 'course', 'ever', 'been', 'Philly', 'Edie', 'husband', 'least', 'witnessing', 'reaction', 'when', 'Fogarty', 'al', 'confront', 'Tom', 'front', 'lawn', 'kidnap', 'Jack', 'Maybe', 'Hubby', 'secrets', 'think', 'first', 'audience', 'son', 'Jack', 'spineless', 'wimp', 'pushed', 'too', 'far', 'hallway', 'high', 'school', 'bully', 'been', 'tormenting', 'there', 'inheritable', 'gene', 'mayhem', 'might', 'ask', 'who', ""'ve"", 'had', 'sand', 'kicked', 'way', 'go', 'kid', 'Even', 'Edie', ""n't"", 'as', 'turned', 'off', 'violence', 'as', 'much', 'thought', 'Tom', 'been', 'lying', 'married', 'life', 'Indeed', 'angry', 'confrontation', 'two', 'escalates', 'bout', 'consensual', 'frenzied', 'sex', 'perhaps', 'not', 'rough', 'was', 'certainly', 'uncomfortable', 'left', 'bruises', 'Is', 'sex', 'low-level', 'violence', 'much', 'James', 'Coburn', 'character', '1967', 'comedy', 'western', 'WATERHOLE', '3', 'called', 'sex', 'assault', 'friendly', 'weapon', 'Tom', 'evident', 'past', 'now', 'loving', 'committed', 'father', 'husband', 'solid', 'law', 'abiding', 'member', 'community', 'OK', 'few', 'lapses', 'old', 'habits', ""'re"", 'good', 'causes', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'infers', 'perhaps', 'Edie', 'can', 'live', 'Hearth', 'Home', 'are', 'more', 'stoutly', 'defended', 'Tom', 'darker', 'side', 'pacifist', 'would', ""n't"", 'act', 'too', 'late', 'other', 'tribes', 'should', 'be', 'so', 'lucky.A', 'HISTORY', 'OF', 'VIOLENCE', 'gritty', 'well-acted', 'visual', 'essay', 'condones', 'condemns', 'potential', 'violence', 'just', 'there', 'waiting', 'tall', 'grass', 'be', 'called', 'forth', 'needed', 'anguished', 'PC-inspired', 'hand-wringing', 'fact', 'not', 'greatest', 'film', '2005', 'liked', 'very', 'much']",N/A

Truncale ""warriorwriter""","[0, 0]","I loved this movie when I first viewed it at a movie theater and I decided to purchase this DVD for my own private collection.  The appeal of this movie works for me on several levels.  The story is about a young couple with a teenage boy and they own a diner in a small town.  One evening while they were closing two thugs walk in and begin threatening everyone in the diner with their guns.  When they attempt to molest a woman the mild mannered owner of the diner, Viggo Mortensen, immediately goes into action throwing hot coffee in the face of one thug and takes the thug's gun killing him and the other armed thug.  These are two very bad career criminals and the news media jumps on the story in this quiet small town.This is really where the story begins to become a mystery and an action packed movie with various surprises. This is also a movie which shows how violence is committed and what it takes  to defeat a person who is determined to hurt you.  Watch closely the simple but highly effective techniques used in all these action scenes in order to appreciate the story.  I do not know if the writers and producers of this movie have ever heard of  a combative system called Target Focus Training, but the hero in this movie understands violence when dealing with these thugs and killers.If you are interested in a simple but also complex movie that has a little bit of everything in it, you may want to check this DVD out.Rating:  5 Stars.

960276,A1LVZOK9F7K4CN,B000CQLZ0Q,JR Pinto,"[6, 12]","I have mixed feelings about this film; I am a HUGE David Cronenberg fan and - while it does have echoes of his earlier work - it doesn't quite measure up to his past glory.  It bears several of the Cronenberg trademarks: a graphic and unromantic depiction of violence and in-your-face gore (literally, sometimes).  Also, even though there is only one scene of full-frontal nudity, there are a couple of graphic sex scenes.Viggo Mortensen plays Tom Stall - a family man who owns a diner somewhere in Middle America.  I understand that the movie is based on a graphic novel (unread by me) and that perhaps points to the weakness of the film.  In the beginning scenes, Stall and his family come across as caricatures of the All-American family - they are almost too good to be true.  His son, Jack, is a good boy who gets picked on at school because he won't fight back.  ""We don't solve our problems in this family by hitting,"" his father admonishes him.Everything changes when Stall's diner gets invaded by bad men who are obviously going to rob the place and kill everybody - or worse!  All of a sudden, pacifist Tom turns into a commando and neatly does away with them.  He becomes an instant hero/celebrity, but you can tell he doesn't like it.  The next day, a mysterious stranger played by Ed Harris shows up.  He claims that Tom is really a bad man named Joey Cusack.  Is he really? It isn't obvious.  If he is, will his family and town protect him?Some of the negative criticism of this movie that I have read asks, ""Is that all there is?""  There is a feeling of thinness to the movie once you reach the end.  We tend to expect more from Cronenberg.  It ends up being a re-tread of the themes of Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven.  Yet, it is violent enough and compelling enough to hold your attention and it is better than much of the studio fare currently available.",3,Good - Not Great - Cronenberg Film...,1128038400,"09 30, 2005",2005,1869,"['have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'film', 'am', 'HUGE', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'fan', 'have', 'echoes', 'earlier', 'work', ""n't"", 'quite', 'measure', 'up', 'past', 'glory', 'several', 'Cronenberg', 'trademarks', 'graphic', 'unromantic', 'depiction', 'violence', 'in-your-face', 'gore', 'literally', 'sometimes', 'Also', 'even', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'full-frontal', 'nudity', 'are', 'couple', 'graphic', 'sex', 'scenes.Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'diner', 'somewhere', 'Middle', 'America', 'understand', 'movie', 'based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'unread', 'perhaps', 'points', 'weakness', 'film', 'beginning', 'scenes', 'Stall', 'family', 'come', 'caricatures', 'All-American', 'family', 'are', 'almost', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'son', 'Jack', 'good', 'boy', 'who', 'picked', 'school', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fight', 'back', 'do', ""n't"", 'solve', 'problems', 'family', 'hitting', 'father', 'him.Everything', 'changes', 'when', 'Stall', 'diner', 'invaded', 'bad', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'obviously', 'going', 'rob', 'place', 'kill', 'everybody', 'worse', 'sudden', 'pacifist', 'Tom', 'commando', 'neatly', 'away', 'instant', 'hero/celebrity', 'can', 'tell', ""n't"", 'like', 'next', 'day', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'played', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'up', 'Tom', 'really', 'bad', 'man', 'named', 'Joey', 'Cusack', 'really', ""n't"", 'obvious', 'will', 'family', 'town', 'protect', 'negative', 'criticism', 'movie', 'have', 'read', 'asks', 'feeling', 'thinness', 'movie', 'once', 'reach', 'end', 'tend', 'expect', 'more', 'Cronenberg', 'up', 'being', 're-tread', 'themes', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Unforgiven', 'violent', 'enough', 'compelling', 'enough', 'hold', 'attention', 'better', 'much', 'studio', 'fare', 'currently', 'available']",N/A

For that I give it more than one star.Aside from that, though, the story as a whole wasn't nearly as thrilling as we were led to believe; the whole ""internal struggle"" that Tom Stall endured wasn't captured well: the main character is just some dumb ex mobster who doesn't know what to do, and actually, Viggo Mortenson captured that rather well: he never looks too sorry or self-conflicted: he just looks like a rat who wants out of a trap.  The way out is to go back to Philly and wipe out his brother and a few henchmen, which he does in rather unimaginative fashion.Overall, that's my main gripe: the story is just boring: nothing brilliant or original about it.  Toss in the bad acting (particularly during intimate family moments, which the cast simply wasn't capable of pulling off), and the lack of much action, I just can't give this more than two stars.

I haven't gotten the book yet so I can't make a comparison but the movie fell a bit short of my expectations...but is still worth seeing, if only because of the huanting performance of Viggo Mortensen and the questions the film raises about identity and the possibility of redemption after leading a violent life.I can't say too much about the film without spoiling the surprises in it but will say that the main character in this film seems to be an ""average Joe"" type of guy, living in a small town, running a cafe/diner, married, two kids, nothing unusual. He loves his wife, is kind to his neighbors and is liked by most people who know him.Then a tragic incident puts him in the limelight and his past and present collide, forcing him to reveal his past to his family and to make some terrible choices. This is when the film starts to go ""over the top"" and viewers may find their credibility stretched to the breaking point. However, Mortensen's acting was so superb that he carried me along with him and I was able to suspend my belief far longer than I might if a less capable actor was pulling off the role. Also, William Hurt has a small but crucial role in this film and, as he so often does, makes the most of it, portraying a wealth of emotions in a short amount of time.

She always looks as though she were too frazzled even to look in the mirror--puzzling in one who is treated throughout the movie as though she were made up and coiffed gorgeously as Grace Kelly in TO CATCH A THIEF.  It's an example of the subtle kind of disconnect that Cronenberg, and his wife the designer Denise Cronenberg, have made to throw uf off balance.  Later on in the movie there's a sequence where William Hurt is filmed with a green screen behind him so that it appears he is larger and taller than Viggo, and even embracing him he seems to lean down and tilt his forehead into Viggo's.  He's wearing the sort of lifts inside his shoes that Hollywood ordinarily reserves for Tom Cruise, all in the name of making him seem larger than life, like a cartoon character.Otherwise I enjoyed this story of two boys, one a gifted athlete, the other a timid, nervous nerd, at odds with each other over the attentions of a baseball coach.  The coach tries to develop the morale of the shy kid, congratulating him when he makes a perfectly ordinary catch in centerfield, and this simple gesture of approval earns the shy boy the lasting enmity of the good-looking popular boy, Bobby (played by Canadian boy idol Kyle Schmid, with big white teeth bigger than license plates).  Bobby is shown driving, nay brooding, around the streets of the little town after dark with a chummy sidekick, a Kenickie type jealous of the shy boy, for it is apparent that Bobby's hatred of Jack is based on either a sublimated locker room lust, or, more likely, a boyish affair between the two during pre-baseball season that Jack suddenly aborted without a word of explanation to jilted Bobby.  Jack, as it turns out, is capable of great acts of violence, though as played by Ashton Holmes (a 30ish teen played with insipid charm and a very loud voice), he is mousy, whiny and a loser by nature.  Does he have a history of violence?  Bobby can't take his eyes off of him.  A friend suggested to me that A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE is Cronenberg's systematic re-enactment of the Kennedy family curse, with the bootlegger grandfather, the warring brothers, the dramatic assassinations, the conflicts between Jack and Bobby.  Instead of the White House, we get a diner set, another of the Cronenbergs' tricks to confuse you, to throw you off the scent of the allegory.If you enjoyed JFK or PT-109, A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE will be right up your alley.Another discordant note comes with the weird overdubbing of Viggo's little daughter, Sarah Stall.  Every time she talks an adult actress seems to be saying her words from a distance behind her, it's creepy as anything you might see in INLAND EMPIRE or MULHOLLAND DRIVE.  They found a little girl who resembles the little POLTERGEIST girl and they use this disturbing reflection to make us reflect on our own addiction to TV.

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[2, 5]","Viggo Mortensen takes off his cowboy hat from ""Hidalgo,"" his sword from ""LOTR,"" and trades them in for a shotgun, a number of handguns, and a few swift punches to the throat to flesh out his role of Tom Stall in ""A History Of Violence.""  The flick starts off with a bit of a surprise, then uses the next twenty or so minutes to build up the monotony, simplicity, and happiness of Stall's life.  He has a perfect wife, Edie (Maria Bello), a good son (Ashton Holmes), and an innocent daughter (Heidi Hayes).  His quiet little diner doesn't draw a lot of business outside of the little town's citizens, but that doesn't bother Tom.One day two murderous thieves stroll into town and try to take the money from Tom's diner and the lives of everyone inside.  With swift and lethal accuracy, Tom takes out both men.  His actions garner the attention of the major news networks and his face is soon plastered all over the country.  This draws out some very seedy characters headed up by a grizzled and gamey Ed Harris, who thinks that Tom is actually Joey Cusack, a Mob hitman from Philadelphia.Threats and plenty of violence follow as the viewer has to decide whether or not Tom really is Joey Cusack.  Once the truth is revealed, another character (William Hurt) enters the fray.This is a very interesting flick to watch.  It is definitely a violent film and the ""R""-rating needs to be taken seriously.  There's a little nudity, some sexuality that includes violent sex, and some very crude language.  Blood splatters, globs, goos, and gushes from just about everyone in this flick, so be warned of that.The acting is stellar.  Mortensen does a wonderful job as Stall, and everyone in his family and in the small town are perfectly cast.  William Hurt has a brief but key role and does everything he can with it.  Ed Harris is perfect in his role of Fogarty, a tough, aging mobster who has a score to settle with Joey Cusack.  He's my personal favorite in this film.Overall, this is a definite purchase for fans of the director, David Cronenberg.  It's unlike any other flick he's put out, and his fans know what I mean.

In the great director's films, he would take the 'normal' man, James Stewart, Cary Grant, and immerse him into abnormal events. Here Mr. Cronenberg, in an excellent film with great supporting actors, does quite the opposite taking the anomolous man, certainly abnormal, and immersing him into normal circumstances. At least until two killers stop for coffee in this quiet midwestern town.You know, Roy Hobbs in ""The Natural"" says about his past life, 'some mistakes you never stop paying for.' And that's how late night eatery owner Tom Stall must feel when the scarred Tom Fogarty (Ed Harris; brilliant; what would you expect?) shows up wanting to bring Tom back to talk to his brother Richie, mobster William Hurt.

960295,A2T049UQONS0OY,B000CQLZ0Q,Larry VanDeSande,"[2, 5]","David Cronenberg is a master at involving viewers in aggressive and explicit behavior in films ranging from ""Scanners"" to ""Rabid"" to ""Videodrome"". He seemingly has a better script at his disposition in ""A History of Violence"" but the film falls prey to the typical Cronenberg shortcomings: superfluous plotline and inadequate ending.Make no mistake, this movie is full of good actors and has a great many compelling scenes. Its story can also be arresting, at least until the time the main character's identity is exposed. From that point forward, this movie is echt-Cronenberg with a lot of needless and explicit bloodletting, no seeming logic in the transposition of certain events, and a completely inadequate ending.Viggo Mortensen, one of the best actors appearing before the public today, combines with Maria Bello as a formidable married couple in this drama which critics mislabeled multilayered. The only thing multilayered in this flick is Bello's character, a loving wife and mother whose lfie changes and, with it, arrives her tangible sense of betrayal. This is acted out realistically and with conviction. Her later frontal nude scene is more of Cronenberg's needless leering into perversion.Mortensen, who is poorly directed by Cronenberg, is a cafe owner whose life turns around after he kills a couple guys that try to rob the place. He is, first, heroic, but this is thae point that his personal history of violence begins to come into focus. That focus is visually sharpened when some mobsters -- including Ed Harris in ludicrous makeup and using a paltry accent -- show up and tell the hero to come clean about his past life, over which they say he owes them much.The story begins to gain interest as the viewer is enveloped in doubt about his identity. However, the real Viggo is soon enough exposed in a group of scenes that are arbitrarily violent without meaning. He closes affairs with mob brother William Hurt -- playing a role even more cartoon characterish than Harris's -- after which he returns to the family he emotionally cheated on and the film ends silently, yet with a resounding thud.If this sounds like a curt and foolish way to end a movie, that's because it is. Cronenberg has never been able to close the deal in his movies and it's no different this time. Without disclosing the action for you, imagine the ending being this: he returns home, kills the family he loves, and the morality tale is resolute. Isn't that more satisfying than what happens here?I was very disappointed that Viggo wasn't better used in this film. To see what he had done before with a role like this, buy, rent or borrow ""The Indian Runner"", a 1991 movie where he plays a character very similar to this one. This may be the best work Bello has done on the screen but it isn't enough to lift this movie beyond the realm of average.For, even though it is full of explicit and graphic scenes of sex, violence and brutality, the visual exploitation is not enough to carry this story that loses momentum about two-thirds of the way through and becomes a cliche of gangster movies at the end.",3,Closer to average than exceptional Cronenberg,1161043200,"10 17, 2006",2006,3103,"['David', 'Cronenberg', 'master', 'involving', 'viewers', 'aggressive', 'explicit', 'behavior', 'films', 'ranging', 'Scanners', 'Rabid', 'Videodrome', 'seemingly', 'better', 'script', 'disposition', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'film', 'prey', 'typical', 'Cronenberg', 'shortcomings', 'superfluous', 'plotline', 'inadequate', 'ending.Make', 'mistake', 'movie', 'full', 'good', 'actors', 'great', 'many', 'compelling', 'scenes', 'story', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'arresting', 'least', 'time', 'main', 'character', 'identity', 'exposed', 'point', 'forward', 'movie', 'echt-Cronenberg', 'lot', 'needless', 'explicit', 'bloodletting', 'seeming', 'logic', 'transposition', 'certain', 'events', 'completely', 'inadequate', 'ending.Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'appearing', 'public', 'today', 'combines', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'formidable', 'married', 'couple', 'drama', 'critics', 'mislabeled', 'multilayered', 'only', 'thing', 'multilayered', 'flick', 'Bello', 'character', 'loving', 'wife', 'mother', 'lfie', 'changes', 'tangible', 'sense', 'betrayal', 'acted', 'out', 'realistically', 'conviction', 'later', 'frontal', 'nude', 'scene', 'more', 'Cronenberg', 'needless', 'leering', 'perversion.Mortensen', 'who', 'poorly', 'directed', 'Cronenberg', 'cafe', 'owner', 'life', 'around', 'couple', 'guys', 'try', 'rob', 'place', 'first', 'heroic', 'thae', 'point', 'personal', 'history', 'violence', 'begins', 'come', 'focus', 'focus', 'visually', 'sharpened', 'when', 'mobsters', 'including', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'ludicrous', 'makeup', 'using', 'paltry', 'accent', 'show', 'up', 'tell', 'hero', 'come', 'clean', 'past', 'life', 'say', 'much.The', 'story', 'gain', 'interest', 'viewer', 'enveloped', 'doubt', 'identity', 'However', 'real', 'Viggo', 'soon', 'enough', 'exposed', 'group', 'scenes', 'are', 'arbitrarily', 'violent', 'meaning', 'affairs', 'mob', 'brother', 'William', 'Hurt', 'playing', 'role', 'even', 'more', 'cartoon', 'characterish', 'Harris', 'family', 'emotionally', 'cheated', 'film', 'silently', 'yet', 'resounding', 'thud.If', 'curt', 'foolish', 'way', 'end', 'movie', 'Cronenberg', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'close', 'deal', 'movies', 'different', 'time', 'disclosing', 'action', 'imagine', 'ending', 'being', 'home', 'family', 'morality', 'tale', 'resolute', ""n't"", 'more', 'satisfying', 'what', 'here', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'Viggo', 'was', ""n't"", 'better', 'used', 'film', 'see', 'what', 'had', 'done', 'before', 'role', 'buy', 'rent', 'borrow', 'Indian', 'Runner', '1991', 'movie', 'where', 'character', 'very', 'similar', 'one', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'work', 'Bello', 'done', 'screen', ""n't"", 'enough', 'lift', 'movie', 'realm', 'average.For', 'even', 'full', 'explicit', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'sex', 'violence', 'brutality', 'visual', 'exploitation', 'not', 'enough', 'carry', 'story', 'momentum', 'two-thirds', 'way', 'cliche', 'gangster', 'movies', 'end']",N/A

Needless to say I was wrong about this movie.Yes, this movie has violence. More violence than I would normally enjoy watching, but it does have a good story line and the acting (especially by Viggo Mortensen) was good.In this movie we meet mild mannered family man, Tom Stall, played by Viggo Mortensen, who owns and runs his own diner in a small town where everyone knows everyone else. Life is good for Tom Stall and his family. Stall becomes a local hero who makes big media news when he defends/protects his small diner and its employees by killing two ruthless killers whom have come to rob the diner. Stall doesn't want the attention or even like the attention he receives from the media. The way he sees it is that he was only doing what any other normal citizen would do under those circumstances and wants nothing more than to return to the quiet lifestyle he once knew.Due to all of the media attention Stall receives, two men, whom are outsiders have come to town seeking out Stall and accusing him of being a ruthless killer named, Joey Cusack, from a mob/crime family in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to which Stall denies. These two men keep harassing Stall and his family. Along the way the violent behavior and fight moves on Stalls part escalate which alludes to him being Joey Cusack, from a mob/crime family in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

960297,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000CQLZ0Q,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 6]","I did not know that ""A History of Violence"" was based on a graphic novel, but it makes perfect sense that this is the case because an ordinary novel would not really work to tell this story.  Whether we are talking the 2005 movie or the original graphic novel, both the audience and the family of Tom Stall need to see the murder and mayhem.  Describing a head turned into a bloody pulp is not a real substitute for seeing it and it is the visceral reaction of Stall's family that matters most in this story, regardless of what response it engenders in the viewers.The story takes place in the small Indiana town of Mlllbrook that is on the way to other places where Tom (Viggo Mortensen) runs the local dinner.  He is married to Edie (Maria Bello), who is a lawyer, and they have two kids, Jack (Ashton Holmes), a teenager who uses his brains to defuse situations with the school bully, and young Sarah (Heidi Hayes), who symbolizes the innocence of the Stall family.  Then comes the day when a pair of brutal men walk into Tom's diner.  We have already been privy to exactly what these two are capable of, and as soon as they give and indication of their intentions in the diner, Tom kills them.  The fact that they are armed and he is not does not matter, and there is an incongruity between the elegance of his ballet of death and the bloody ruins that result.Tom becomes a hero and a television news crew is there to greet (read: ""hound"") him as soon as he comes home from the hospital.  Tom spurns the limelight, not because he is particularly shy or humble, but because seeing his face on television sets and the front page of newspapers is going to get him recognized.  That is because Tom has a secret, one which explains why he could kill those two men so effortlessly and why the scarred Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris) shows up in town calling Tom ""Joey"" and threatening his family.What makes ""A History of Violence"" different as a revenge drama is how what happens between the explosions of violence is way more important than the murder and mayhem.  We have seen this sort of story before, where somebody turns out to be someone else and their family has to deal with the revelation.  But Stall's family is confronted with an extreme level of violence from the man who is their husband and father.  It is clear that they are repulsed.  However, the key scenes in the film become those in which Jack and then Edie discover that violence is something with which they appear to be more comfortable than they would like to think.Killing everybody who comes from Philadelphia looking for him does not become a viable way of living the rest of his life, so the man whose name is not really Tom has to return to the City of Brotherly love for an ironic confrontation with Richie Cusack (William Hurt in his Oscar nominated supporting role).  Ultimately, ""A History of Violence"" is a film where actions speak louder than words and in the end words become an inadequate refutation of what has happened.Does the ending of director David Cronenberg's speak to some sort of acceptance of what has happened?  Sir Thomas More reminds us that silence assumes assent.  But when neither party is speaking silence becomes a cipher of indecision.  The most important thing about ""A History of Violence"" is that when the film is over, the story is not, and you are free to impose your own view of the future for the characters who are left alive in the wake of this violence.",4,David Cronenberg's take on living with violence,1142467200,"03 16, 2006",2006,3462,"['did', 'not', 'know', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'was', 'based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'perfect', 'sense', 'case', 'ordinary', 'novel', 'would', 'not', 'really', 'work', 'tell', 'story', 'are', 'talking', '2005', 'movie', 'original', 'graphic', 'novel', 'audience', 'family', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'need', 'see', 'murder', 'mayhem', 'Describing', 'head', 'turned', 'bloody', 'pulp', 'not', 'real', 'substitute', 'seeing', 'visceral', 'reaction', 'Stall', 'family', 'most', 'story', 'regardless', 'what', 'response', 'viewers.The', 'story', 'place', 'small', 'Indiana', 'town', 'Mlllbrook', 'way', 'other', 'places', 'where', 'Tom', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'local', 'dinner', 'married', 'Edie', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'who', 'lawyer', 'have', 'two', 'kids', 'Jack', 'Ashton', 'Holmes', 'teenager', 'who', 'brains', 'defuse', 'situations', 'school', 'bully', 'young', 'Sarah', 'Heidi', 'Hayes', 'who', 'innocence', 'Stall', 'family', 'Then', 'day', 'when', 'pair', 'brutal', 'men', 'walk', 'Tom', 'diner', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'privy', 'exactly', 'what', 'two', 'are', 'capable', 'as', 'soon', 'give', 'indication', 'intentions', 'diner', 'Tom', 'fact', 'are', 'armed', 'not', 'not', 'matter', 'incongruity', 'elegance', 'ballet', 'death', 'bloody', 'result.Tom', 'hero', 'television', 'news', 'crew', 'there', 'greet', 'read', 'hound', 'as', 'soon', 'home', 'hospital', 'Tom', 'limelight', 'not', 'particularly', 'shy', 'humble', 'seeing', 'face', 'television', 'sets', 'front', 'page', 'newspapers', 'going', 'get', 'recognized', 'Tom', 'secret', 'one', 'why', 'could', 'kill', 'two', 'men', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'why', 'scarred', 'Carl', 'Fogarty', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'up', 'town', 'calling', 'Tom', 'Joey', 'threatening', 'family.What', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'different', 'revenge', 'drama', 'how', 'what', 'explosions', 'violence', 'way', 'more', 'important', 'murder', 'mayhem', 'have', 'seen', 'sort', 'story', 'where', 'somebody', 'out', 'be', 'someone', 'else', 'family', 'deal', 'revelation', 'Stall', 'family', 'confronted', 'extreme', 'level', 'violence', 'man', 'who', 'husband', 'father', 'clear', 'are', 'repulsed', 'However', 'key', 'scenes', 'film', 'become', 'Jack', 'then', 'Edie', 'discover', 'violence', 'something', 'appear', 'be', 'more', 'comfortable', 'would', 'like', 'think.Killing', 'everybody', 'who', 'Philadelphia', 'looking', 'not', 'become', 'viable', 'way', 'living', 'rest', 'life', 'man', 'name', 'not', 'really', 'Tom', 'return', 'City', 'Brotherly', 'love', 'ironic', 'confrontation', 'Richie', 'Cusack', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'supporting', 'role', 'Ultimately', 'History', 'Violence', 'film', 'where', 'actions', 'speak', 'louder', 'words', 'end', 'words', 'become', 'inadequate', 'refutation', 'what', 'happened.Does', 'ending', 'director', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'speak', 'sort', 'acceptance', 'what', 'happened', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'More', 'silence', 'assent', 'when', 'party', 'speaking', 'silence', 'cipher', 'indecision', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'when', 'film', 'story', 'not', 'are', 'free', 'impose', 'own', 'view', 'future', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'left', 'alive', 'wake', 'violence']",N/A

But it moves so fast and is so engaging that I didn't get it until long after I had left the theater.  It opens with a scene of two bad guys who have just commited an act of violence.  It is clear that they will show no mercy as they approach a small town in Indiana with the intent of more mayhem.It's at this point that we are introduced to Viggo Mortensen, cast as a Tom Stall, who runs a small diner in town.  He and his wife, Maria Bello, have been married for twenty years, have a young daughter and a teenage son and are a happy couple.  We know that's about to change.  But at this point we have no idea how much. Soon, the bad guys come calling.  Tom Stall acts fast and saves innocent people.  Immediately, he's proclaimed a hero.But that's just the beginning of the story.  Soon Ed Harris visits the diner.  He's mob connected and bad.  He keeps calling the soft-spoken Tom Stall by another name.  All of a sudden, the whole family is in danger.  It seems that Tom has a secret, a big secret.  How this all plays out kept me on the edge of my seat.  The acting and directing were so good that it all became real.  There are changes in the relationship between Tom and his wife.  There is also a big change in the son.  The pace of the film gets faster and more complex until it finally reaches a very satisfying climax.It wasn't till later that I realized that his film was more than just an exciting suspense drama.

960302,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000CQLZ0Q,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[5, 9]","The situation here is very intriguing, if not new. Tom Stall is a typical small town man. He runs a diner, he has a loving wife and a typically Hollywood-style troubled teen. All seems well, until a pair of psychos roll into town. The psychos try to make trouble at the diner, and Tom easily takes them down. He's an instant hero, which draws in the mob, who believes he's in witness protection. Normally I am very careful to hide details of the ""ending"" of a movie in a review, but in this case it's revealed about halfway through and I need to discuss the situation in the review. So if you haven't seen this movie yet and want to watch it completely ""blind"", please stop reading here.Tom is, indeed, an assassin who is in fact the brother of the current crime boss. Repeated trips by mobsters to his quiet rural home make it clear that he can't just stay in hiding. He decides the only solution is to head home to ""talk"" to his brother - which ends up meaning he slays everyone in sight. Then he returns home, sits down with his wife and kid, and the movie ends.I really appreciate what was attempted here. Viggo is a great actor, and there are many interesting aspects of the transformation. For example, let's take his marriage. They start with the wife, to be ""racy"", dressing up as a sweet cheerleader from high school. Only a short while later, when she realizes he's an assassin, they have a brutally passionate sex scene on the stairs. Tom in fact tries to pull back, and she pulls him down to her again. She's discovering her own darker side.Tom tried to ""reform"" from his previous life. He says that he spent a few years in the desert, changing. His new name, ""Tom Stall"", was ""available"". Did he know someone who died? Was it someone he killed? I love the ambiguity. He even tries to tell his son to be peaceful with the school bullies. He's not grumpy with his small diner restaurant. He's honestly proud of it. He's happy with his life. He isn't ""making do"" - he is content. There are many small touches shown throughout the movie that reflects this.So now, the issues that I have. First, David Cronenberg is a horror movie director and it really shows. It turns the movie from a dark, psychological thriller to something that is more over-the-top. Some of the deleted things border on silly. I am all for violence in context. The violence was heavy handed here, so that it crossed from being realistic and into the realm of fantastic. It meant the movie became less ""real"". That's fine in a movie that is meant to be violent for violence sake, like say Predator. I love movies like that. However, this movie had amazing potential for being a *psychological* gripper. That means you really have to believe 100% in the characters and their personalities and motives, to be caught up in that. The movie was missing in that. There were also several plot holes which were too big for suspension of disbelief, which also made the connection to the characters falter.Here's one situation. Tom grew up with the mob. He was in fact an assassin for them. Yet when some mob guys show up, he thinks somehow they'll ""go away"". It's not like Tom is without people who can easily identify him. Surely his brother saw the news footage! Yet he leaves his entire family at risk by hanging around, waiting. The bad guys show up. He could go with them, to save his family. Nope, he doesn't do that either. Eventually he decides to go talk with his brother, and shoots up the entire place, leaving fingerprints all over. Then he walks out and tosses the gun in the pond. Nope, I bet the police will never spot it there. And then ... he drives home again?There was so much depth that could have been developed here. The relationship between Tom and his son, how both reacted to situations, how Tom dealt with the situations he faced. Besides the aforementioned sex duality, however, most of the rest was whitewashed. I would have loved to see more meaningful time between Tom and his son. I'd have loved to see Tom in more ""grey"" situations. Instead, it was all black and white.The ""meaning"" that did survive was pretty light. Sure, everyone can change. We see that every day, with people who are corrupted by wealth, and other people who turn their back on a life of crime to be peaceful. It's normal, it's not ""strange"". The mob wasn't ""evil"" any more than Tom was ""good"". They were all just men who had their personal drives. Many mobsters will tell you they were born into a family and raised to be loyal to that family. They don't kill innocent civilians, they kill ""soldiers"" who actively threaten them. That was Tom's life. Life is about shades of grey, about people sliding along the scale, making decisions, interacting with others. The movie went right past all of that into the blood and gore.As a final note, I pegged the landscape as Canadian as soon as it opened - that fall foliage was a pretty clear giveaway. While it was pretty, it also took away from the realism. Surely Canadian film costs can't be *so* low that they are incapable of filming a film about the midwest IN the midwest? It seemed like a shallow cheat to me. The midwest has such a rich history, a gorgeous landscape, and that ""safe quiet"" was such a critical component of the storyline that it was disappointing to me to be reminded constantly that they were lying about it.",3,Great Potential - But Lacking in Realism,1144627200,"04 10, 2006",2006,5352,"['situation', 'here', 'very', 'intriguing', 'not', 'new', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'typical', 'small',

Eskildson ""Pragmatist""","[1, 2]","A History of Violence is a film about Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen)l a loving husband and father to a family with two children in a small town in Indiana.  Corn fields surround his rural area home and he drives a pick-up truck.  Tom also owns a small diner in town and has been in this town and married,living a quiet idyllic existence for about twenty years.The movie slowly builds and develops complexity when Tom stops a vicious robbery in his diner.  He protects his innocent employees and customers in amazing defensive and offensive reflexes beyond what normal men can do.  Tom reminded me of a Clark Kent that can turn into his alter-ego Superman when needed.  (His son also shows Tom's quick reflexes and thinking when he is unfairly attacked by high school bullies.  By standing up to the bully and his friends he gains respect and the right to be left alone.)Unfortunately for Tom, he is featured as a hero on several news stations as well as the newspaper.  His life and face are in the spotlight, which immediately signals a threatening mobster from out of town (Ed Harris).  He arrives into town with two thugs with a story that Tom attacked him and ruined his face and eye with barbed wire.  Tom's past is unpeeled layer by layer as he struggles to protect his family from his violent past.After the two confrontations and killing out of town mobsters, Tom is ruinited with his ""good guy"" brother, Ritchie (William Hurt).

First of all, how does one comprehend the fact that David Cronenberg has directed such a mainstream movie?  This was a complete shocker to me.  I expected a movie like his previous ones (Spider, Crash [the 1997 version], or eXistenZ).  The main acting is very strong, not as strong as other films, but William Hurt should be able to contend with all of the other Oscar contenders for Supporting Actor, although I think Clooney or the surprise Giamatti have the best shot.  What is interesting is that, on the whole, this movie is better than any other film this year.  Brokeback Mountain relies on its acting to have the plot succeed, much like the acting in Capote.  Those two films could have easily failed, but because of the amazing acting they succeeded.  This film does not really need amazing acting because it is well written.  It does need above average acting, but the story was so well adapted from the graphic novel.

960308,AQCH8SYTDL23W,B000CQLZ0Q,Mark It Zero,"[2, 6]","I'll state it right away - Cronenberg is one of my favorite directors, living or dead, so it's more than likely that I'll at the very least ENJOY his work, let alone absolutely adore it.  A History of Violence is one of my favorite films of the last 10 years, and was the best film of 2005.  It's a film that, as stated before by other reviewers, raises far more questions than it answers but that's Cronenberg, a film maker who loves to make his audience think - and if they cringe in the process, all the better.Cronenberg began his carrer with more horror orientated films, They Came From Within (aka Shivers) and Rabid.  But even with these films the enemy, the monster, wasn't some other being, but the evil force bent on destruction was within the self, which is far more frightening than being chased by Frankenstein's monster of a werewolf, because no matter how far, how fast you run, you cannot escape yourself.  (I think the best example of this is either The Fly or Videodrome.)Back to the film at hand.  A History of Violence, based on the graphic novel by Locke and Wagner, shares very little with said GN, Cronenberg even states it himself.  They start off the same, somewhat, but the film eventually veers off into more philosophical territory than the comic.Violence is a horrible thing, no matter how seemingly tiny of an event, be it a school fight or the murder of a family member, it destroys lives, leaves scars, it is the ultimate horror.  The violence in the film isn't styilized (like Tarantino, who Cronenberg has spoken out against.), it's realistic and disturbing.  If you engage in an act of violence it will come back to you, perhaps ten-fold, and will destroy some aspect of your life.This is what I got out of the film.  I listened to bits and pieces of Cronenberg's commentary, and he said it's not an ironic film, and I agree, it's a cathartic study of what violence can do to a seemingly loving and intimate (this is the justification behind the accusedly ""graphic"" sex scenes.) couple, and their family.Maybe when I watch the film again I'll delve even deeper into the whole thing, but I'm tired.",5,"A past you cannot escape - a future you cannot foresee, best film of 2005",1149552000,"06 6, 2006",2006,2132,"[""'ll"", 'state', 'right', 'away', 'Cronenberg', 'one', 'favorite', 'directors', 'living', 'dead', 'more', 'likely', ""'ll"", 'very', 'least', 'ENJOY', 'work', 'let', 'alone', 'absolutely', 'History', 'Violence', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'last', '10', 'years', 'was', 'best', 'film', '2005', 'film', 'stated', 'other', 'reviewers', 'far', 'more', 'questions', 'Cronenberg', 'film', 'maker', 'who', 'make', 'audience', 'think', 'cringe', 'process', 'better.Cronenberg', 'began', 'carrer', 'more', 'horror', 'orientated', 'films', 'Came', 'Within', 'Shivers', 'Rabid', 'even', 'films', 'enemy', 'monster', 'was', ""n't"", 'other', 'being', 'evil', 'force', 'bent', 'destruction', 'was', 'self', 'far', 'more', 'frightening', 'being', 'chased', 'Frankenstein', 'monster', 'werewolf', 'matter', 'how', 'far', 'how', 'fast', 'run', 'can', 'not', 'escape', 'think', 'best', 'example', 'Fly', 'Videodrome', 'Back', 'film', 'hand', 'History', 'Violence', 'based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'Locke', 'Wagner', 'shares', 'very', 'little', 'said', 'GN', 'Cronenberg', 'even', 'start', 'same', 'somewhat', 'film', 'eventually', 'off', 'more', 'philosophical', 'territory', 'comic.Violence', 'horrible', 'thing', 'matter', 'how', 'seemingly', 'tiny', 'event', 'be', 'school', 'fight', 'murder', 'family', 'member', 'lives', 'scars', 'ultimate', 'horror', 'violence', 'film', ""n't"", 'styilized', 'Tarantino', 'who', 'Cronenberg', 'spoken', 'out', 'realistic', 'disturbing', 'engage', 'act', 'violence', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'perhaps', 'ten-fold', 'will', 'destroy', 'aspect', 'life.This', 'what', 'got', 'out', 'film', 'listened', 'bits', 'pieces', 'Cronenberg', 'commentary', 'said', 'not', 'ironic', 'film', 'agree', 'cathartic', 'study', 'what', 'violence', 'can', 'do', 'seemingly', 'loving', 'intimate', 'justification', 'accusedly', 'graphic', 'sex', 'scenes', 'couple', 'family.Maybe', 'when', 'watch', 'film', 'again', ""'ll"", 'delve', 'even', 'deeper', 'whole', 'thing', ""'m"", 'tired']",N/A

Viggo plays Tom Stall, a man who runs a Norman Rockwell type diner in a Midwestern town in Indiana.  He lives a simple life.  On a road to this town are some bad guys who decide one night to go to this diner.  What happens next sets into place not so much a chain reaction, but an opening of a door into Tom's past.  A History of Violence is thankfully not a ""thoughtful"" film about ""violence"" even though many may claim it to be.  It has that in it somewhat, but I don't know if that was so much the point.  The story is more centered on the character of Tom Stall and the life he has led.  Violence is not a trait as much as an action or tool that is applied in the film.  It is an old devil resurrected again to keep some kind of balance with things.  The balance soon shifts though, as Tom's son decides to start using this action of defense against the school bully.  The film does have its shooting scenes that will show you carnage with torn flesh and broken teeth.  Ed Harris is really, really good as an organized crime boss who thinks that Tom Stall is someone he used to know.  The ending was actually quite good, at least not the very end but the scene that showed a road trip that went back through the door into the past, which has a trail that shows us a history of violence.

Even upon seeing the first scene, I was under impression that this was going to be a movie in the vein of Natural Born Killers.  The scope of the movie I ended up seeing was far smaller than I was expecting, but that took nothing from its impact.This is a very different, very good movie.  It makes you remember that you can never truly KNOW someone.  You can know their personality, their quirks, etc... yet you can never get inside of that person's head and listen in on their thoughts and admissions made only to themselves about their past.  Vigo Mortensen plays that out wonderfully in this film.  He appears to be a good man - and virtuous man, who lives and earns for those he loves.  His family is cared for, it would seem, by the hand of a gentle and caring man.  You truly believe this until his past begins to stalk him down and truth begins to reveal itself.The supporting cast couldn't have been much stronger.  Maria Bello, Ed Harris and William Hurt all give stirring performances.  William Hurt's character is one that you will remember.

Cook,"[0, 0]","Beyond the controversy, beyond the hype, beyond all of the critical praise, ""A History of Violence"" is a slow-burn of a movie, demanding of repeated viewings. Much of the reviews on Amazon seem to have been in answer to all of the critical hype moreso than the film itself.David Cronenberg's films have always been challenging, to say the least, and that is precisely why he is one of my fave directors.The opening shot of the film is remarkable. I'm talking about the way Cronenburg frames the visual elements - doors, windows, wall panels... not too unlike comic book panels! He straight off the bat acknowledges the very inspiration for this film (being as it is based on the graphic novel by John Wagner & Vince Locke). But the violence of this film has no resemblance to the violence of the usual comic book. The opening scene also seems to play around with normal perceptions of time, where the younger man drives the car down to the office, which is only a few paces away(!) and then when his partner walks out of the office almost immediately, he is asked what took him so long(!). Just like in a comic, where panel-to-panel movement is meant to convey a sense of flow, which entails a sense of time. But, in a comic, how do you measure time? Maybe I'm reading too much into this; but this is the way that I interpreted this scene.Viggo Mortensen was great in the part of Tom Stall, as he always is! Most people only recognise him as ""that guy from Lord of the Rings"" which, while I don't deny that those films certainly made him a household name, to me, Viggo will always be Frank from ""The Indian Runner"". For those who haven't seen it, do yourselves a favour and check it out. If you like ""A History of Violence"" you'll love ""Indian Runner"". In it he plays another troubled soul locked in a cycle of violence against a brother who doesn't like the life he leads! Ah, I just love synchronicities... Oh, well, I'm done with this review, I'm going to watch ""Indian Runner""!",3,"If you like ""A History of Violence"" you'll love...",1142899200,"03 21, 2006",2006,1981,"['controversy', 'hype', 'critical', 'praise', 'History', 'Violence', 'slow-burn', 'movie', 'demanding', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'Much', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'answer', 'critical', 'hype', 'moreso', 'film', 'itself.David', 'Cronenberg', 'films', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'challenging', 'say', 'least', 'precisely', 'why', 'one', 'fave', 'directors.The', 'opening', 'shot', 'film', 'remarkable', ""'m"", 'talking', 'way', 'Cronenburg', 'visual', 'elements', 'doors', 'windows', 'wall', 'panels', 'not', 'too', 'comic', 'book', 'panels', 'straight', 'off', 'bat', 'very', 'inspiration', 'film', 'being', 'based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'John', 'Wagner', 'Vince', 'Locke', 'violence', 'film', 'resemblance', 'violence', 'usual', 'comic', 'book', 'opening', 'scene', 'also', 'play', 'around', 'normal', 'perceptions', 'time', 'where', 'younger', 'man', 'car', 'down', 'office', 'only', 'few', 'paces', 'away', 'then', 'when', 'partner', 'office', 'almost', 'immediately', 'asked', 'what', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'Just', 'comic', 'where', 'panel-to-panel', 'movement', 'meant', 'convey', 'sense', 'flow', 'sense', 'time', 'comic', 'how', 'do', 'measure', 'time', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'reading', 'too', 'much', 'way', 'interpreted', 'scene.Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'was', 'great', 'part', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'always', 'Most', 'people', 'only', 'recognise', 'guy', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'do', ""n't"", 'deny', 'films', 'certainly', 'made', 'household', 'name', 'Viggo', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'Frank', 'Indian', 'Runner', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'do', 'favour', 'check', 'out', 'like', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', ""'ll"", 'love', 'Indian', 'Runner', 'troubled', 'soul', 'locked', 'cycle', 'violence', 'brother', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'life', 'Ah', 'just', 'love', 'synchronicities', 'Oh', 'well', ""'m"", 'done', 'review', ""'m"", 'going', 'watch', 'Indian', 'Runner']",N/A

I don't remember reading a single review about it when it originally came out, maybe one, but that was about it. I knew nothing before my boyfriend suggested it to watch.Unlike many ""violent"" movies out there, this film gives so much more meaning to a violent film. It looks bloody realistic, with bits of brain being blown over someone else, and it's so realistic that you almost forget it's a film.The main character, Tom Stall, a seemingly ordinary family man, gets involved with a couple of would-be robbers. He shoots them dead, when they attack his staff, and later becomes a hero in his little town, where everyone knows everything.But is Tom hiding something? Because someone, played by a very scarred Ed Harris, sees Tom on the news, but only, he doesn't know him as Tom - he knows him as Joey. And he owes Joey a beating.After this, I lost track a bit. For me, I was never quite sure whether Tom was actually Joey or was Joey actually Tom. Viggo Mortensen played it so convincingly, that I actually believed he was Tom, and not Joey, but is there a hint of schizophrenia in there too?There's a great relationship between Tom & his wife, played by Maria Bello (Coyote Ugly). They have some extremely powerful scenes together, and two scenes show two very different sides to their physical relationship. The first scenes shows a happy loving couple, revisiting their love from a long time ago, by playing at teenagers again. Maria Bello in a cheerleader outfit? Yeah I think that'll do it for most guys. A later scene, where Tom is Joey, shows some very conflicting emotions while on the stairs, as it seems to be revealed that Edie knew all along that Tom was Joey, but is still happy to show a rougher side to their physical relationship. Looks painful!The ""monsters"" that Tom's daughter dreams about and is scared of at the start, gives a little preview to what is going to happen. The monsters are real.It's a very difficult movie to forget, but after reading that Thomas Jane turned down the role of Tom, I think I would have preferred to see him rather than Viggo Mortensen. I just don't like him personally as an actor. But altogether A History Of Violence is a lot better than many so called violent films out there, and is well worth seeing.",3,Not sure about this,1168128000,"01 7, 2007",2007,2342,"['came', 'watch', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'knowing', 'anything', 'previously', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'reading', 'single', 'review', 'when', 'originally', 'came', 'out', 'maybe', 'one', 'was', 'knew', 'nothing', 'boyfriend', 'suggested', 'watch.Unlike', 'many', 'violent', 'movies', 'there', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'meaning', 'violent', 'film', 'bloody', 'realistic', 'bits', 'brain', 'being', 'blown', 'someone', 'else', 'so', 'realistic', 'almost', 'forget', 'film.The', 'main', 'character', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'seemingly', 'ordinary', 'family', 'man', 'involved', 'couple', 'would-be', 'robbers', 'shoots', 'dead', 'when', 'attack', 'staff', 'later', 'hero', 'little', 'town', 'where', 'everyone', 'everything.But', 'Tom', 'hiding', 'something', 'someone', 'played', 'very', 'scarred', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Tom', 'news', 'only', ""n't"", 'know', 'Tom', 'Joey', 'Joey', 'beating.After', 'lost', 'track', 'bit', 'was', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'Tom', 'was', 'actually', 'Joey', 'was', 'Joey', 'actually', 'Tom', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'played', 'so', 'convincingly', 'actually', 'believed', 'was', 'Tom', 'not', 'Joey', 'there', 'hint', 'schizophrenia', 'too', 'great', 'relationship', 'Tom', 'wife', 'played', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'have', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'together', 'two', 'scenes', 'show', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'sides', 'physical', 'relationship', 'first', 'scenes', 'happy', 'loving', 'couple', 'revisiting', 'love', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'playing', 'teenagers', 'again', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'cheerleader', 'outfit', 'Yeah', 'think', ""'ll"", 'do', 'most', 'guys', 'later', 'scene', 'where', 'Tom', 'Joey', 'very', 'conflicting', 'emotions', 'stairs', 'be', 'revealed', 'Edie', 'knew', 'Tom', 'was', 'Joey', 'still', 'happy', 'show', 'rougher', 'side', 'physical', 'relationship', 'painful', 'monsters', 'Tom', 'daughter', 'scared', 'start', 'little', 'preview', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'monsters', 'are', 'real.It', 'very', 'difficult', 'movie', 'forget', 'reading', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'turned', 'down', 'role', 'Tom', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'see', 'rather', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'personally', 'actor', 'altogether', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'lot', 'better', 'many', 'so', 'called', 'violent', 'films', 'there', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

960319,A1TJPMB7N776WS,B000CQLZ0Q,MICHAEL ACUNA,"[59, 80]","Director David Cronenberg's movies glisten with a surface sheen that is always perfect. His mise en scene is often pathologically devoid of human connection or touch, though his films are always thought provoking and often scandalous in their grasp of the detritus of our lives. Is there any more beautiful movie than ""Dead Ringers?"" Any movie as scandalous, off-putting yet compelling as ""Crash?"" (the version with Rosanna Arquette and Holly Hunter).In his terrific new film, ""A History of Violence"" Cronenberg has it both ways: his film features a straight forward plot that he handles with just a slight out-of-kilter quality that adds crunch and bite to the story of a man, Tom Stall (the quintessential strong silent, Gary Cooper-type, Viggo Mortensen) who, when placed in a situation that requires swift and brutal force...vomits out the internal fortitude necessary from deep inside his psyche and bowels to come up with the goods to deal with the situation. ""AHOV"" then, is about violence, brutality and the far reaching and ever telescoping tentacles that both exhibit as they wreak havoc on Tom, his wife Edie (the luminous Maria Bello) and his family and friends.Cronenberg is dealing with some lofty and controversial ideas here: Kill someone and forever pay the price for that murder, whether or not the crime is justified or not. Commit violence and that violence colors everything that you are, everything that you do for the rest of your life. Once you take someone's life how much of you, the essence, the soul, the heart of you is gone also?Viggo Mortensen's Tom Stall is strong of mind and morals, tender, vulnerable, upstanding but ultimately conflicted. Mortensen turns in a shaded performance that not only shows up Tom's soft side but also his malevolent one as well. Maria Bello, usually miss-used in her previous films is a revelation here as Edie: intelligent, accomplished, dedicated and hopelessly in love with Tom but aware that many times being in love doesn't mean you know everything about the object of that love.""A History of Violence"" is Cronenberg's ""Vertigo"": his version of obsession, violence and retribution told the Cronenbergian way: slanted toward the perverse...bordering on the maniacal. Don't blame Cronenberg because he is not Hitchcock, for he has learned his lessons from the master well. Blame him because he has come up with a film that is provocative and multi-layered though: one as transparent as a silk screen, just slightly out of reach...beckoning us in for a closer, scalpel-like investigation of what makes us tick, the buttons to punch to make us react and the mechanics necessary to allow us to exist.",5,The Killings,1128038400,"09 30, 2005",2005,2662,"['Director', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'movies', 'glisten', 'surface', 'sheen', 'always', 'perfect', 'mise', 'en', 'scene', 'often', 'pathologically', 'devoid', 'human', 'connection', 'touch', 'films', 'are', 'always', 'thought', 'provoking', 'often', 'scandalous', 'grasp', 'detritus', 'lives', 'there', 'more', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'Dead', 'Ringers', 'movie', 'scandalous', 'off-putting', 'yet', 'compelling', 'Crash', 'version', 'Rosanna', 'Arquette', 'Holly', 'Hunter', '.In', 'terrific', 'new', 'film', 'History', 'Violence', 'Cronenberg', 'ways', 'film', 'straight', 'forward', 'plot', 'just', 'slight', 'out-of-kilter', 'quality', 'crunch', 'bite', 'story', 'man', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'quintessential', 'strong', 'silent', 'Gary', 'Cooper-type', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'who', 'when', 'placed', 'situation', 'swift', 'brutal', 'force', 'out', 'internal', 'fortitude', 'necessary', 'deep', 'psyche', 'bowels', 'come', 'up', 'goods', 'deal', 'situation', 'AHOV', 'then', 'violence', 'brutality', 'far', 'reaching', 'ever', 'telescoping', 'tentacles', 'exhibit', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'Tom', 'wife', 'Edie', 'luminous', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'family', 'friends.Cronenberg', 'dealing', 'lofty', 'controversial', 'ideas', 'here', 'Kill', 'someone', 'forever', 'pay', 'price', 'murder', 'not', 'crime', 'justified', 'not', 'Commit', 'violence', 'violence', 'colors', 'everything', 'are', 'everything', 'do', 'rest', 'life', 'take', 'someone', 'life', 'how', 'much', 'essence', 'soul', 'heart', 'gone', 'also', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'strong', 'mind', 'morals', 'tender', 'vulnerable', 'upstanding', 'ultimately', 'conflicted', 'Mortensen', 'shaded', 'performance', 'not', 'only', 'up', 'Tom', 'soft', 'side', 'also', 'malevolent', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'usually', 'miss-used', 'previous', 'films', 'revelation', 'here', 'Edie', 'intelligent', 'accomplished', 'dedicated', 'hopelessly', 'love', 'Tom', 'aware', 'many', 'times', 'being', 'love', ""n't"", 'mean', 'know', 'everything', 'object', 'love', 'History', 'Violence', 'Cronenberg', 'Vertigo', 'version', 'obsession', 'violence', 'retribution', 'told', 'Cronenbergian', 'way', 'slanted', 'perverse', 'bordering', 'maniacal', 'Do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Cronenberg', 'not', 'Hitchcock', 'learned', 'lessons', 'master', 'well', 'Blame', 'come', 'up', 'film', 'provocative', 'multi-layered', 'one', 'as', 'transparent', 'silk', 'screen', 'just', 'slightly', 'reach', 'beckoning', 'closer', 'scalpel-like', 'investigation', 'what', 'tick', 'buttons', 'punch', 'make', 'react', 'mechanics', 'necessary', 'allow', 'exist']",N/A

960322,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B000CQLZ0Q,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[0, 0]","David Cronenberg is not the first person I think of for an action film.  But then, despite the movie's name, this isn't an action film.  It's parable about all kinds of violence: violence between parent and child, between children, between husband and wife, between brothers, and of course, good old-fashioned violence against people who disagree with you.The Stalls are a perfect family.  There's hot lawyer wife Edie (Maria Bello), soft-spoken Tom (Viggo Mortensen), and their children: wisecracking teenage Jack (Ashton Holmes) and cute-as-a-button Sarah (Heidi Hayes). Into this perfect family portrait enters violence in the form of bullies at school and thugs who attempt to rob Tom's diner.It turns out that Tom has an ugly past he's been trying to keep secret.  But when Tom violently repels the robbers and becomes a minor celebrity, his past comes back in force.Carl Fogarty (a snarling Ed Harris), a mobster who wants Tom to ""go for a drive,"" shows up at Tom's doorstep, threatening his friends and family.  Things spiral downward from there.Tom's struggle isn't just about his criminal past. Cronenberg unspools on screen a litmus test of violent scenarios, and then asks the audience each time: Is this okay?  The questions start out easy to answer and become increasingly complex.  By the time Tom grabs his wife in a violent embrace that turns passionate, we suddenly understand that each person defines their own boundary of when violence is and isn't acceptable.  And the morality attached to each act of violence is a fluid thing indeed.All the actors pull their weight in History of Violence, except perhaps Hayes--she's no Dakota Fanning, but she acts suitably cute (a little too cute).  Everyone else is excellent, from Bello's desperate, hurt looks to Holmes terrified/thrilled rage, to the inimitable Harris as a very scary man.  And of course there's Mortensen, who infuses every character with a level of depth with a sad glance.By the time Richie Cusack (William Hurt) appears, the violence at home has come full circle.  I'm not particular fond of Hurt, but he does an excellent, frightening job here, as a mobster completely bereft of any moral compass.This movie poses important questions that challenge American assumptions about violence, similar to how American History X challenged our assumptions about racism.

As a standard thriller, AHV is pretty good. It can boast a good script and it is well directed by David Cronenberg. Thrillers must have one necessary element to succeed: good villains.

And AHV has some dandy villans: two of them played by Ed Harris and William Hurt, who give excellent performances as stone cold killers. Like many thrillers, AHV is the story of how one man deals with violence, alone and without help from the cops.

Fogaty is unwilling to accept Tom's casual dismissal, and begins to stalk Tom and his family.""Violence"" is an excellent movie.  From a solid story to solid acting, ""Violence"" is top notch on all levels.  The story is compelling.  The uncertainty of Tom's past keeps the viewer engaged in his plight.  The four main actors all give top notch performances.  Mortensen gives no clue as to his characters past, portraying Tom as a man living a quiet peaceful life until confronted with violence.  Maria Bello is excellent as Tom's wife, who loves and supports her husband.  Harris is pure evil and menace as Fogaty.  His character is not likeable in the least, and you know that he is not going to leave Tom to live his life peacefully.  Finally, William Hurt gives a memorable, and at times, funny performance.

When 2 men come in, they dont seem to want to leave and they want to do some damage to the customers, so Viggo takes matters in his own hands and kills the 2 men and winds up with a knife wound in his foot. This pins him as a Local Hero to the town and  attracts a few men, one with a wicked looking dead eye named  Carl Fogarty, played with sinister support by Ed Harris (The Human Stain, The Rock). Harris tells Mortensen that Tom isnt his real name and Joey Cusack is his real name, he lived in Philadelphia and he has a brother named Ritchie Cusack but Mortensen denies this, he denies that he's this Joey character that their talking about. So, Mortensen's Wife finds out the truth, and I am not going to tell you all what happens next. The result is a shocking and jaw dropping thriller with Mortensen in top form digging into one of the best performances of his career and we all know Mortensen was Aragorn, in which he was superb dont get he wrong, but this shows that he can go the distance.

960328,A1FG91CM8221X1,B000CQLZ0Q,Miles D. Moore,"[2, 3]","The setup of ""A History of Violence,"" David Cronenberg's provocative and profoundly disturbing new film, is simple: Tom Stall, a quiet, inarticulate diner owner in small-town Indiana, becomes a national hero when he blows away two psycho killers who threaten him and his patrons. Then three sinister mob goons show up in town, insisting that Tom is really Joey Cusack, a long-vanished Philadelphia mob hitman who once, shall we say, did them a disservice. The genius of ""A History of Violence"" is that the question of Tom's identity is what Hitchcock would have called the McGuffin; the real point of the film is a delirious meditation on the nature of violence, love, atonement and forgiveness. Because this is David Cronenberg, the moral lesson is illustrated with vats of blood; Cronenberg pulls no punches about the effects of a bullet from a .38 Magnum on a human face. But far more disturbing than the physical violence, as Cronenberg demonstrates, is the emotional violence that distrust and fear can wreak on even the most loving family relationships. Viggo Mortensen, in a role that affords him little dialogue, must tell his character's story with his face and body; the results are revelatory. Maria Bello is equally impressive as Edie, Tom's wife, who goes from loving support to fear, distrust and hatred as she learns increasingly unwelcome new secrets about the husband she thought she knew. As mobsters, Ed Harris is brilliantly menacing, William Hurt brilliantly wacked-out. There is also excellent work from Stephen McHattie as one of the diner psychos and young Ashton Holmes as Tom and Edie's teenage son. In his best work, Cronenberg is able to elicit abundant sympathy for his characters, even as he ties our minds and stomachs into knots.

960329,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000CQLZ0Q,mirasreviews,"[4, 7]","""A History of Violence"" is a allegory in the guise of a small-town drama, based on the graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke and adapted for the screen by John Olson. The film poses questions of violence in a personal and social context, such as: When is violence justified? What implication might it have for the perpetrator? Does violence simply beget more violence?  Or not? The best thing about the film is that it presents its questions without being dogmatic and within the context of a mystery surrounding the film's genial protagonist. Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) is a family man with a wife (Maria Bello) he adores, a young daughter, and a teenaged son, who lives a quiet life in a small town, where he owns a diner. When a couple of sadistic thugs try to rob his restaurant, Tom saves the day and becomes a local hero. Then an East Coast gangster with a grudge to settle, Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris), arrives in town claiming that Tom is his old enemy, ruthless enforcer Joey Cusack, who disappeared decades ago after robbing Fogarty of the use of one eye.Director David Cronenberg begins ""A History of Violence"" on just the right notes: ambiguity and curiosity. When I was watching it, I thought the beginning of the film might be too slow, but once the pace picked up, I appreciated the measured, almost studious start. Tom Stall seems like a great guy.  Just a glance from him elicits sympathy. But the fact that we don't know if Tom might be Joey builds real suspense. This film has an idyllic calm that is sporadically punctuated by extreme violence. But it's the mystery behind Tom, and Joey, and Fogarty that keeps the audience engrossed while a surprising allegory plays out. That is David Cronenberg at his best. I think the film falls down a little in how it handles Jack (Ashton Holmes), Tom's son, because I don't think that teenagers care who wins a baseball game in gym class, and I don't think they speak like that. Actually, no one does. But that is really a quibble. Viggo Mortensen is terrific here. I don't think that Tom was intended to be a realistic character, but rather a mythical one. ""A History of Violence"" ranks among the few films that have successfully explored extremes of duality in the human character.The DVD (New Line 2006): ""Acts of Violence"" (1 hour, 5 min) is a making-of documentary that divides the film into 8 acts, exploring each separately. It includes behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with the cast, with David Cronenberg, and with various crew who show us how scenes were created. ""Scene 44: Deleted Scenes"" (3 min), with optional director's commentary, is a dream sequence shown in its context that didn't make the final cut. ""The Unmaking of Scene 44"" (6 min) shows us how the scene was created and comments on why it was cut. ""Violence's History"" (1  min) compares the European version of the film to the US version, in which 2 scenes of violence were softened slightly. ""Too Commercial for Cannes"" (9 min) takes us tot the 2005 Cannes Film Festival, where we see preparation for the screening, a press conference, hectic interviews, and Cronenberg snapping away with his Nikon for a French film magazine.

The violence is brutally graphic, the sex kinky and the film thematically awards only those who observe the plight of Tom Stall (an excellent Viggo Mortensen) with a keen and searching eye.  But if you're willing to peer closely, ""A History of Violence"" proves itself to be one of the best films in recent memory, working on multiple levels as possible essays on the nature of violence, the innateness of brutally to the individual, the violent and sexual menace that lurks beneath small-town America or the danger of passing violent tendencies from generation to generation.  But, thankfully, it also works as a good old-fashioned wrong-man thriller, and it finds gifted director David Cronenberg (The Fly) firing on all cylinders.Tom Stall (Mortensen) is enjoying the quiet life in Millbrook, Indiana with his wife (a dynamite Maria Bello), with whom he still enjoys a pumped-up sex life, and his two children.  But his tranquility is shattered when two men who have been rampaging around rural towns come to his diner for a bit of robbery and rape.  Stall springs into action, dispelling the would-be robbers with ruthless efficiency, shocking everyone he knows, none moreso than his son (name) who has always been taught to avoid violence, even in the face of a local harasser.  For Stall, things reallys take a turn for the worse when a group of mobsters, led by the gleefully wicked Carl Fogerty (the reliably superb Ed Harris) and under the orders of mob kingpin Ritchie Cusack (a mesmerizing William Hurt), arrive and accuse Stall of really being named Joey Cusack, Ritchie's brother, a man they have been trying to track down for years.From there, Cronenberg and screenwriter Josh Olson keep the surprises coming at a furious pace, with Cronenberg indulging his usual penchant for gratuitous violence and sexuality.  But Cronenberg also brings out uniformly excellent performances from his gifted cast.  It's great to see ""Lord of the Rings"" alum Mortensen stretch himself and show how good of an actor he truly is.  Maria Bello makes a worthy sparing partner to Mortensen as both actors subtly show the ugly mutations their characters undergo.  And it's a kick to see great character actors like Ed Harris and William Hurt cut loose and become one-man-wrecking balls as whacked-out mobsters bent on revenge.  A film that both thrills and intellectually entices, ""A History of Violence"" is one of the best films in recent memory, and it demands to be seen and examined.",5,One of the Best in Recent Memory,1144800000,"04 12, 2006",2006,2543,"['History', 'Violence', 'definitely', 'not', 'movie', 'everyone', 'violence', 'brutally', 'graphic', 'sex', 'kinky', 'film', 'thematically', 'only', 'who', 'observe', 'plight', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'excellent', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'keen', 'searching', 'eye', ""'re"", 'willing', 'peer', 'closely', 'History', 'Violence', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'recent', 'memory', 'working', 'multiple', 'levels', 'possible', 'essays', 'nature', 'violence', 'innateness', 'brutally', 'individual', 'violent', 'sexual', 'menace', 'small-town', 'America', 'danger', 'passing', 'violent', 'tendencies', 'generation', 'generation', 'thankfully', 'also', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'wrong-man', 'thriller', 'gifted', 'director', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'Fly', 'firing', 'cylinders.Tom', 'Stall', 'Mortensen', 'enjoying', 'quiet', 'life', 'Millbrook', 'Indiana', 'wife', 'dynamite', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'whom', 'still', 'pumped-up', 'sex', 'life', 'two', 'children', 'tranquility', 'shattered', 'when', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'rampaging', 'around', 'rural', 'towns', 'come', 'diner', 'bit', 'robbery', 'rape', 'Stall', 'springs', 'action', 'dispelling', 'would-be', 'robbers', 'ruthless', 'efficiency', 'shocking', 'everyone', 'none', 'moreso', 'son', 'name', 'who', 'always', 'been', 'taught', 'avoid', 'violence', 'even', 'face', 'local', 'harasser', 'Stall', 'things', 'reallys', 'take', 'turn', 'worse', 'when', 'group', 'mobsters', 'led', 'gleefully', 'wicked', 'Carl', 'Fogerty', 'reliably', 'superb', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'orders', 'mob', 'kingpin', 'Ritchie', 'Cusack', 'mesmerizing', 'William', 'Hurt', 'arrive', 'accuse', 'Stall', 'really', 'being', 'named', 'Joey', 'Cusack', 'Ritchie', 'brother', 'man', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'track', 'down', 'years.From', 'there', 'Cronenberg', 'screenwriter', 'Josh', 'Olson', 'keep', 'surprises', 'coming', 'furious', 'pace', 'Cronenberg', 'indulging', 'usual', 'penchant', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'sexuality', 'Cronenberg', 'also', 'out', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'performances', 'gifted', 'cast', 'great', 'see', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'alum', 'Mortensen', 'stretch', 'show', 'how', 'good', 'actor', 'truly', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'worthy', 'sparing', 'partner', 'Mortensen', 'actors', 'subtly', 'show', 'ugly', 'mutations', 'characters', 'undergo', 'kick', 'see', 'great', 'character', 'actors', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'William', 'Hurt', 'cut', 'loose', 'become', 'one-man-wrecking', 'balls', 'whacked-out', 'mobsters', 'bent', 'revenge', 'film', 'thrills', 'intellectually', 'entices', 'History', 'Violence', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'recent', 'memory', 'be', 'seen', 'examined']",N/A

The movie also has some extremely good action scenes that remind me of the old ""Deathwish"" films, where the hero dramaticly evens the score with some disgusting criminals. The concept and general story line are interesting and relatively complex.  Still, this film ends up being closer to 2 stars than to 4 stars.What went wrong?  Well, for starters the relationships between family members seems contrived.  Stall's (Mortenson) relationship with his wife (Maria Bello) doesn't really have any chemistry.  Don't get me wrong, the director tries to gin something up with a couple of sex scenes that are over the top for this type of film.  While some won't mind the scenes, those clips would fit better in a ""9 1/2 weeks part IV"".  At any rate, the scenes fail to accomplish their mission, which should have been to show some sort of relationship between the characters.  The daughter is cute and that's about it.  The son isn't really likeable at all and his relationship to his father is just odd.Also, there isn't enough action or suspense in the film to compensate for a lack of chemistry between the people we're supposed to be cheering for.  The details of the story fall flat.In the end, you're left with a movie that has some good actors, 3 good action scenes, and a decent plot concept.

I'll pick 'rambo'. It's an overanalysis. All these philosophical issues raised are interpretations fathomed by observation. Such is philosophy. Does that make the movie great. The movie is about a person who changes his way but is forced to face his old self again. That sentence alone could summon infinite philosophical chit chat. Such is philosophy.Really this movie had the scope to be truly breathtaking. But instead, we are fed a simple story imploding under the guise of its own shadow. It is up to us to do all the thinking because the truth is, the writers themselves dont know how. I prefer 'Clockwork Orange'... truly exploring issues it presented.To describe this movie in the form of a violent confrontation... I'd call it a messy brawl that begins with a few shoves in an alley , and ends on top of a high rise building. Its all over the place.I mean it tries to do everything and turns out to be nothing. Other than what is proposed in commercials and previews, I dont think I got much more out of it. Its part action movie... part family drama... part romance... part thriller.. oh yeah and part darwin's theory. It swings every way... but never hits.It doesnt bother delving deep into the true consequenses of Tom's history. The family's ability to deal with the bombshell is brushed off. The emotional connections are severed, the drama ignored. The story merely transcends into a classic b-grade movie where the character is faced with a clear one dimensional objective (in this case, Tom to finish what he had started... Kill the baddies and be home in time for supper).I cant believe the ordeal ends with a family dinner. Iconic, but far from satisfying. This should have been the story.

Together, they've brought two kids into the world. Tom owns a small diner and Edie has a professional career going. The next question to ask, can you ever really change who you really are? Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) thought maybe he could.An unfortunate event occurs which raises both of these questions and reveals their obvious answers. The lives of this small mid-western couple come unraveled when a couple of small time scumbags try to rob Tom's little diner of whatever tiny bit of cash might be on-hand, but, being the scumbags that they are, figure raping the waitress would be in order as well. Their plans disintegrate when Tom commandeers a weapon and kills them both, but this casts Tom simple life into the world of instant media darling. Having his unwanted fifteen minutes of fame also draws the attention of Philadelphia connections Tom buried a lifetime ago.The movie has a good action theme behind it and some good casting. The usual suspects, Mortensen, Ed Harris and William Hurt, play their parts very well, but the casting goes downhill from there. Particularly poor is the casting of the Stall children, who fail to convincingly portray their roles. The ending of the movie is also rather abrupt, but beyond that, the movie does have a good flow of action and even of relatively steamy scenes between Mortensen and Bella.This is no Academy Award winner, but it is a good action film with a fine plot behind it.

I finally bought it off Amazon.com for like six bucks and just the other day got around to watching it.What had i been waiting for?  I don't know.  I hadn't ready the graphic novel and I hear very little about it from friends and coworkers so the buzz wasn't really there.  Well...I was pleasantly surprised, even though Cornenberg strains on a coulple of things.  Ed Harris and William Hurt's characters are so cliche and overplayed.  The sex scenes (the cheerleader outfit and the near-rape on the stairs) were so gratuitous it wasn't even funny.  It was like, hey, lets throw some porn in here.  I'm all for sex scenes, bot those didn't make much sense.  Overall, Viggo Mortensen was great as Tom Stall, the coffeeshop guy turned hero when a couple of freaky bad dudes show up to rob the joint and hurt people.  Scuffle.  Gun loose.  Tom Stall winds up blowing them both away.  (Here you get the first real glimpse that Cornenberg directed when the dying thug is laying on the floor shuddering with half his face blown off.)  Publicity brings in some new customers, of the hoodlum variety.  Carl Fogarty (ed Harris) a Philly wiseguy shows up and starts calling Tom ""Joey Cuzak "" in a sneering, irritating way.  Who is this Joey Cuzak?  A Philly mobster and brother of mob kingpin Ritchie Cuzak.  A really bad dude that killed a lot of people.  Well, Tom doesn't know what Fogarty is talking about.  Or does he?  Does he have A History Of Violence.Overall this was an entertaining flick.  Try not to dig too deep or you'll wind up picking it apart.  Just enjoy it for what it is.

960344,AYBL30P5NXNZ4,B000CQLZ0Q,"Mr. Stephen Kennedy ""skenn1701a""","[5, 10]","This is a gem of a movie.  It is one of those rare treats that you can enjoy on multiple levels - as a straight forward thriller, or as it is really intended, as something much more thought provoking.We start the movie with Tom Stall (Viggo Mortnesen) and his wife played by Mario Bello exhibit all the characteristics of a happy, safe, marriage.  Passionate, intimate, good kids etc... Then their world is disrupted, when two bad guys come into the diner where he works.  They set out to do nasty things, and Stall is propelled into a brief but highly effective eruption of violence.  He is feted as a hero, but we begin to see the changes in his relationship with his son in particular as a result.  As the town comes back to normal however, the ever brilliant Ed Harris comes into town.  He is convinced Tom Stall is actually someone else altogether, an explanation that fits with the violence we have seen.  To say more about the plot would be to deprive you of seeing how things unfold, so I will leave it at that.It is in the subtexts that the movie excels - not telling us what we should think, but questioning our own reactions.  Is his son right for using more violent means with bullies?  Was a little violence necessary to balance his pacifist ways?  Is the couples `violent' sex more real than the passion we see near the beginning of the movie?As stated by others, it is after the movie ends and you start talking about the movie.. and you WILL start talking about the movie, that you will realise how effective it actually was.  The performances are uniformly excellent - Mario Bello brings real credibility to a wife dealing with the changes in her husband, and Ashton Holmes as Tom Stall's son is brilliant.  William Hurt is almost unrecognisable in the role of a mob boss teetering on the edge of sanity.  And last but not least, Howard Shore gives a muted and perfectly sorrowful score, completely at odds with the violence in a way that helps the movie immensely.There is violence, and there is sex, but all tightly controlled and more tense than graphic, and all carefully crafted to service the story.  The ending will disappoint you if you tackle this as a mere action movie.. but if you want a real kick off into the whole subject of the influence and effects of violence, then this is a perfect place to start.",5,Multilayered and absorbing,1174694400,"03 24, 2007",2007,2334,"['gem', 'movie', 'one', 'rare', 'treats', 'can', 'enjoy', 'multiple', 'levels', 'straight', 'forward', 'thriller', 'really', 'intended', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'thought', 'provoking.We', 'start', 'movie', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'Viggo', 'Mortnesen', 'wife', 'played', 'Mario', 'Bello', 'exhibit', 'characteristics', 'happy', 'safe', 'marriage', 'Passionate', 'intimate', 'good', 'kids', 'etc', 'Then', 'world', 'disrupted', 'when', 'two', 'bad', 'guys', 'come', 'diner', 'where', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'nasty', 'things', 'Stall', 'propelled', 'brief', 'highly', 'effective', 'eruption', 'violence', 'feted', 'hero', 'begin', 'see', 'changes', 'relationship', 'son', 'particular', 'result', 'town', 'back', 'normal', 'however', 'ever', 'brilliant', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'town', 'convinced', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'actually', 'someone', 'else', 'altogether', 'explanation', 'violence', 'have', 'seen', 'say', 'more', 'plot', 'would', 'be', 'deprive', 'seeing', 'how', 'things', 'unfold', 'will', 'leave', 'that.It', 'subtexts', 'movie', 'excels', 'not', 'telling', 'what', 'should', 'think', 'questioning', 'own', 'reactions', 'son', 'right', 'using', 'more', 'violent', 'means', 'bullies', 'Was', 'little', 'violence', 'necessary', 'balance', 'pacifist', 'ways', 'couples', 'violent', 'sex', 'more', 'real', 'passion', 'see', 'beginning', 'movie', 'stated', 'others', 'movie', 'start', 'talking', 'movie..', 'WILL', 'start', 'talking', 'movie', 'will', 'realise', 'how', 'effective', 'actually', 'was', 'performances', 'are', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'Mario', 'Bello', 'real', 'credibility', 'wife', 'dealing', 'changes', 'husband', 'Ashton', 'Holmes', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'son', 'brilliant', 'William', 'Hurt', 'almost', 'unrecognisable', 'role', 'mob', 'boss', 'teetering', 'edge', 'sanity', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'Howard', 'Shore', 'muted', 'perfectly', 'sorrowful', 'score', 'completely', 'odds', 'violence', 'way', 'movie', 'immensely.There', 'violence', 'sex', 'tightly', 'controlled', 'more', 'tense', 'graphic', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'service', 'story', 'ending', 'will', 'disappoint', 'tackle', 'mere', 'action', 'movie..', 'want', 'real', 'kick', 'whole', 'subject', 'influence', 'effects', 'violence', 'then', 'perfect', 'place', 'start']",N/A

This film, ""A History of Violence,"" is a powerful little tale directed by David Cronenberg.  A powerful tale not because the film has a surprisingly overwhelming amount of violence (I was shocked that it didn't relatively have all that much violence).  It is a powerful tale because Cronenberg and scriptwriter Josh Olson take the time to build up strong individual characters and have a plot powerfully told.  This film works.As to the overall feel of the film, for some reason I was reminded of older Alfred Hitchcock movies where it seems like a normal tale on the surface but you get this sense that underneath it all something dark this way lies.  It will be difficult to write too much about the plot line without giving away any spoilers.  Besides the great directing and screen writing (and oh did I mention some pretty fine acting chops) the story twists is definitely a strong suite of ""A History of Violence.""  Concisely and vaguely, Viggo Mortensen plays Tom Stall.  One of those good stable guys everybody loves around a small town.  Maria Bello, who deserves a lot of attention for her strong performance in this film, plays his wife.  He has a son and daughter too.  The perfect American Dream little nuclear family.  Or is it?  There are also some chillingly wicked performances clocked in by Ed Harris, he of the milky eyed scar-faced demeanor.  The more suprising role is that played by William Hurt, whom I've never seen as a villain before.  He pulls it off deliciously.So yes there is some violence along the way.  If that turns you off, this probably isn't the best film for you.  But it does make one think about the role of violence in society and how that may be connected to something primal in us all.  The American culture has been accused of having a morbid unhealthy fascination towards violence as reflected by the fare put out by Hollywood and the media.  So there are some grains of truth in that, but in ""A History of Violence,"" the violence unexpectedly enough isn't front and center.  It is presented more as a by-product of human nature.  What is front and center are the strong characters played by Mortenson and Bello.  Oh...before I wrap up the staircase scene with those two actors is one for all times.  You will not want to miss one of the more unique sex scenes laid down on celluloid (and carpet).  This flick isn't a must see, I'd say...but you'll probably want the DVD if you are interested in what a person can do with filmmaking.  The extras are great in that department.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[1, 3]","Based on the Vertigo graphic novel, A History of Violence is transformed (in this case, for the better) by screen writer Josh Olson and master director David Cronenberg.  Viggo Mortensen stars as Tom Stall, a diner owner in rural Indiana who lives a happy life with his wife (Maria Bello), young daughter, and teenage son.  When two desperate crooks attempt to rob the diner and lay waste to the patrons, Tom springs into action and kills them both, rather easily.  From this point on Tom garners unwanted attention as he has become a local celebrity, and has also gained the attention of a disfigured mobster (Ed Harris, happily chewing his scenery) who claims to know him from years back and keeps calling him Joey.  Without giving too much away, as the film goes on Cronenberg briskly delves into the human psyche and examines the most basic instinct: survival.  The performances from Mortensen, Bello, Harris, and William Hurt in a brief, but unforgettable (and Oscar nominated) role are some of the best that Cronenberg has ever gotten from any actor in any film he's ever done.  The only downside to A History of Violence is that it's over too soon, and fans of Cronenberg may not appreciate it as much as his previous films.  That aside, A History of Violence is one of the better comic to film adaptations of late (and it doesn't feature spandex), and in the footsteps of Crash and Spider, it's another fine examination of human nature by David Cronenberg.",4,Another fine work from Cronenberg,1147132800,"05 9, 2006",2006,1464,"['Based', 'Vertigo', 'graphic', 'novel', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'transformed', 'case', 'better', 'screen', 'writer', 'Josh', 'Olson', 'master', 'director', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'diner', 'owner', 'rural', 'Indiana', 'who', 'happy', 'life', 'wife', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'young', 'daughter', 'teenage', 'son', 'When', 'two', 'desperate', 'crooks', 'attempt', 'rob', 'diner', 'lay', 'waste', 'patrons', 'Tom', 'action', 'rather', 'easily', 'point', 'Tom', 'garners', 'unwanted', 'attention', 'become', 'local', 'celebrity', 'also', 'gained', 'attention', 'disfigured', 'mobster', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'happily', 'chewing', 'scenery', 'who', 'know', 'years', 'back', 'calling', 'Joey', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'film', 'Cronenberg', 'briskly', 'human', 'psyche', 'most', 'basic', 'instinct', 'survival', 'performances', 'Mortensen', 'Bello', 'Harris', 'William', 'Hurt', 'brief', 'unforgettable', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'role', 'are', 'best', 'Cronenberg', 'ever', 'gotten', 'actor', 'film', 'ever', 'done', 'only', 'downside', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'over', 'too', 'soon', 'fans', 'Cronenberg', 'may', 'not', 'appreciate', 'as', 'much', 'previous', 'films', 'aside', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'one', 'better', 'comic', 'film', 'adaptations', 'late', ""n't"", 'feature', 'spandex', 'footsteps', 'Crash', 'Spider', 'fine', 'examination', 'human', 'nature', 'David', 'Cronenberg']",N/A

In fact, it is so predictable, and the ending is so stupid that I can't help but feel this movie has irrevocably cast Viggo Mortensen as the 21st Century Harrison Ford - that's not good. All od the acting is just a notch above high school drama class or bad regional theatre, but at least Viggo and Bello are attractive. Bello is trying desperately to be Kathleen Turner but lacks the wit and the chops. William Hurt must be desperate, as must Ed Harris - they turn in two of the worst performances of their careers, and if you have followed Hurt's recent oeuvre, you can imagine how bad that is. The kid actors stink, all of them. The sex is non-committal, the violence leers toward gratuitous, and that's quite something when you consider it's about violence.Harris, Hurt and a slew of stuffed actors take turns imitating Sylvester Stallone in order to give the film a ""Philly"" feel. Maybe someone forgot to tell them that Stallone is only marginally connected to Philly, having spent all of his formative years in north Jersey or Brooklyn, which is the actual accent Rocky has, not some meat packer's patter from Kensington. I don't what town substituted for Philadelphia - it is way too clean, tidy, and the streets are too wide. The ""mob bar"" where Viggo meets his brother's driver is way too upscale and clean for the neighborhood it's meant to inhabit, and Viggo orders a Genessee Cream Ale - now I don't know where in Pennsylvania, let alone Philadelphia, you can have an option of that brew on tap or bottle.The icing on the cake is Viggo's effort to mime everyone else's imitation of Stallone's accent when he switches over to his ""Joey"" (there's another name for a thug from Philly?) persona. In short, it is a contrived film that began with a sense of revulsion and horror and just caves in to the type of melodrama you'd see in  B movies of the past. Pulp cinema.And that ending!

However, this movie is an excellent thriller/drama of sorts, with a dark message about today's average family. Simply put, it's about the violent tendencies men have in today's society and how it can be hidden under the guise of being the hardworking American bread winner. In this case, its Viggo Mortgensen, the quiet father and loving husband who runs his own little diner in middle America.He has a vague past which is eventually worked out in the movie. One thing is for sure, he is no stranger to violence and becomes the unlikely town hero for his ""skills"", saving some lives in the process. But the irony here is that violence begets more violence, no matter how noble the motives might be. Moreover, violence is ingrained in our society and we can't run away from it, even in small town America.Cronenberg exhibits these themes successfully, without trying to indoctrinate. He simply gives some powerful images and scenes to work with. The ""action"" scenes are few but they pack a serious punch. I haven't seen too many movies with scenes this compact yet graphic. I suppose brevity is the soul of wit, especially in this case.I had a bit of a problem with William Hurts' character. I thought that there could have been a better fit of actor there.

I made a mistake with this movie. I went in, having had difficulty securing a Cronenberg movie before, waiting to get an introduction to his style. I went in expecting, based on what I've heard about Cronenberg, a stylized film. I came in expecting a theme.I was mostly disappointed on all three marks. What I ended up with was a fairly straight-forward identity thriller, and that surprised me.Viggo Mortensen plays Tom Stall, a docile man in a docile world. Viggo Mortensen's style of acting, judging by Lord of the Rings, Hidalgo, and this film, is to whisper when he's getting dramatic. This works well with the film in that everyone in it is either just as docile as Tom, or trying to be smooth and stoic, which involves an outward appearance of docility. Tom Stall owns a caf&eacute;, has a good family, has no worries but that he can't get his truck started. Then some violent criminals decide to mess with his coworkers during closing, and he shows a side of himself nobody (in the film) expected: the ability to kill with relative ease. So thus the audience is in the search for his identity, who he is, and where he came from.This film started many things and decided to give them up. At first it seems a film to look into the undercurrent of violence in even the most domestic of communities. Then it seems to be a film of mistaken identity and bad fate. Then it just decides to be another story of a man escaping a past he didn't like, and finding out that he can't... as in, what we've seen many many times before.But it's a Cronenberg film. This means that it's stylized, interesting, and special, right? Honestly, I saw nothing in this film that struck me particularly as ""something only Cronenberg could do."" Sure, there's some pretty detailed gore effects, but they're sporadic, random, and worst of all, not needed for anything. Sure, there's some strange sexual encounters, but they don't really seem as anything except for sex, they don't develop the characters, they don't add anything to the story, they just exist in a sort of acceptable state of ""Well, might as well find a way to show these characters having sex."" They do reveal that Viggo Mortensen doesn't have that great of a body, if anybody cares about that.Speaking of the writing, indeed, it doesn't seem real care or interest was put into the script. Nothing particularly new is given us, the dialog could have been cut and pasted in any other movie of this genre, and the character development was, again, straight-forward and unappealing.As I mentioned before, I thought a large part of the lethargy in this film had something to do with the theme of violence as an undercurrent, but my mistake was thinking there was a theme. Even during moments when the action starts to pick up, it feels like the actors are really just sleep-walking through their roles. Only Ed Harris seemed to have any fun at all, everything else about this movie seems as though Cronenberg forced the cast and crew to stay awake for 24 hours before filming began to make everything seem lazy. Even the cinematography seems lazy after the wonderful long take at the beginning. However, stuff like the close-ups never really added to drama but more made me frustratingly want to take the director's chair and say, ""All right, move back a couple of feet, give us some room!"" It's not a bad film. It's just that the ending credits came up after an exhaustingly long ending sequence of no importance and I couldn't help asking, ""Oh? So what?"" This film is a good film to have some fun over the weekend with, but it's not really anything that can stick with you.--PolarisDiB",3,Disappointingly straight-forward,1128297600,"10 3, 2005",2005,3731,"['review', 'may', 'have', 'few', 'spoilers.How', 'one', 'movie', 'often', 'one', 'approach', 'film', 'made', 'mistake', 'movie', 'went', 'having', 'had', 'difficulty', 'securing', 'Cronenberg', 'movie', 'waiting', 'get', 'introduction', 'style', 'went', 'expecting', 'based', 'what', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Cronenberg', 'stylized', 'film', 'came', 'expecting', 'theme.I', 'was', 'mostly', 'disappointed', 'three', 'marks', 'What', 'ended', 'up', 'was', 'fairly', 'straight-forward', 'identity', 'thriller', 'surprised', 'me.Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'docile', 'man', 'docile', 'world', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'style', 'acting', 'judging', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Hidalgo', 'film', 'whisper', 'when', 'getting', 'dramatic', 'well', 'film', 'everyone', 'either', 'just', 'as', 'docile', 'Tom', 'trying', 'be', 'smooth', 'stoic', 'outward', 'appearance', 'docility', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'caf', 'eacute', 'good', 'family', 'worries', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'truck', 'started', 'Then', 'violent', 'criminals', 'decide', 'mess', 'coworkers', 'closing', 'side', 'nobody', 'film', 'expected', 'ability', 'kill', 'relative', 'ease', 'So', 'thus', 'audience', 'search', 'identity', 'who', 'where', 'came', 'from.This', 'film', 'started', 'many', 'things', 'decided', 'give', 'up', 'first', 'film', 'look', 'undercurrent', 'violence', 'even', 'most', 'domestic', 'communities', 'Then', 'be', 'film', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'bad', 'fate', 'Then', 'just', 'be', 'story', 'man', 'escaping', 'past', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'finding', 'out', 'ca', ""n't"", 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'many', 'times', 'before.But', 'Cronenberg', 'film', 'stylized', 'interesting', 'special', 'right', 'Honestly', 'saw', 'nothing', 'film', 'struck', 'particularly', 'something', 'only', 'Cronenberg', 'could', 'do', 'Sure', 'pretty', 'detailed', 'gore', 'effects', ""'re"", 'sporadic', 'random', 'worst', 'not', 'needed', 'anything', 'Sure', 'strange', 'sexual', 'encounters', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'anything', 'sex', 'do', ""n't"", 'develop', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'story', 'just', 'exist', 'sort', 'acceptable', 'state', 'Well', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'find', 'way', 'show', 'characters', 'having', 'sex', 'do', 'reveal', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', ""n't"", 'have', 'great', 'body', 'anybody', 'that.Speaking', 'writing', 'indeed', ""n't"", 'seem', 'real', 'care', 'interest', 'was', 'put', 'script', 'Nothing', 'particularly', 'new', 'given', 'dialog', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'pasted', 'other', 'movie', 'genre', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'again', 'straight-forward', 'unappealing.As', 'mentioned', 'thought', 'large', 'part', 'lethargy', 'film', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'theme', 'violence', 'undercurrent', 'mistake', 'was', 'thinking', 'there', 'was', 'theme', 'Even', 'moments', 'when', 'action', 'pick', 'up', 'actors', 'are', 'really', 'just', 'sleep-walking', 'roles', 'Only', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'seemed', 'have', 'fun', 'everything', 'else', 'movie', 'Cronenberg', 'forced', 'cast', 'crew', 'stay', 'awake', '24', 'hours', 'filming', 'began', 'make', 'everything', 'seem', 'lazy', 'Even', 'cinematography', 'lazy', 'wonderful', 'long', 'take', 'beginning', 'However', 'stuff', 'close-ups', 'never', 'really', 'added', 'drama', 'more', 'made', 'frustratingly', 'want', 'take', 'director', 'chair', 'say', 'right', 'move', 'back', 'couple', 'feet', 'give', 'room', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'just', 'ending', 'credits', 'came', 'up', 'exhaustingly', 'long', 'ending', 'sequence', 'importance', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'asking', 'Oh', 'what', 'film', 'good', 'film', 'have', 'fun', 'weekend', 'not', 'really', 'anything', 'can', 'stick', 'you.', 'PolarisDiB']",N/A

960365,A260X99UW6HA9Z,B000CQLZ0Q,Prauge Traveler,"[0, 3]","""A History of Violence"" is a thoroughly entertaining film.  It is filled with tension, pregnant pauses in the dialogue, and unease from start to finish.  The movie also has some great moments of dark humor that break the tension from time to time, allowing it build again.  All in all, I think this is a great movie.  But, it is probably not everyone's style: if you are looking for the usual Hollywood ending with complete resolution, this is not the film for you.The film begins with the small town family of Tom Stall living the American dream in a small town somewhere in Indiana.  Stall is forced to defend himself and his patrons when some villains attempt to rob and murder at his small diner.  The celebrity that comes along with his daring rescue leads to unwanted attention that brings a cast of entirely un-Stall like characters crawling out of his past- a past that he denies existed.  This tension rises to the memorable climax in a movie that I think can be considered a modern classic of suspense and psychological thrill.David Cronenberg uses some fairly graphic violence to tell his story, and he manages it without going over the top; however, if you are turned off by violence don't watch this movie.  The actors are all well casted, and Vigo Mortensen sheds his stereotype and shines in this new role.  Ed Harris is at the peak of his form and William Hurt also does a great job with his small but important role.  I am not used to seeing Maria Bello, but she is obviously a great actor, and does a very nice job.  Ashton Holmes also brings a unique perspective and dimension to the movie that would have been lacking had he not used his talents so well.",5,Small town hero with a big city skeleton in the closet,1145664000,"04 22, 2006",2006,1674,"['History', 'Violence', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'filled', 'tension', 'pregnant', 'pauses', 'dialogue', 'unease', 'start', 'finish', 'movie', 'also', 'great', 'moments', 'dark', 'humor', 'tension', 'time', 'time', 'allowing', 'build', 'again', 'think', 'great', 'movie', 'probably', 'not', 'everyone', 'style', 'are', 'looking', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'complete', 'resolution', 'not', 'film', 'you.The', 'film', 'small', 'town', 'family', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'living', 'American', 'dream', 'small', 'town', 'somewhere', 'Indiana', 'Stall', 'forced', 'defend', 'patrons', 'when', 'villains', 'attempt', 'rob', 'murder', 'small', 'diner', 'celebrity', 'along', 'daring', 'rescue', 'leads', 'unwanted', 'attention', 'cast', 'entirely', 'un-Stall', 'characters', 'crawling', 'past-', 'past', 'existed', 'tension', 'memorable', 'climax', 'movie', 'think', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'modern', 'classic', 'suspense', 'psychological', 'thrill.David', 'Cronenberg', 'fairly', 'graphic', 'violence', 'tell', 'story', 'going', 'top', 'however', 'are', 'turned', 'off', 'violence', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'actors', 'are', 'well', 'casted', 'Vigo', 'Mortensen', 'stereotype', 'shines', 'new', 'role', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'peak', 'form', 'William', 'Hurt', 'also', 'great', 'job', 'small', 'important', 'role', 'am', 'not', 'used', 'seeing', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'obviously', 'great', 'actor', 'very', 'nice', 'job', 'Ashton', 'Holmes', 'also', 'unique', 'perspective', 'dimension', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lacking', 'had', 'not', 'used', 'talents', 'so', 'well']",N/A

960371,A2L7WYA5OENV03,B000CQLZ0Q,Reticuli,"[1, 2]","This film is extremely promising.  In spite of the seeming pretension of the long take opening scene, up until about the 60% mark, the film has a number of nice setups and pay offs.  While the characters seem very simplistically written, the fact remains it's how most people like these actually behave.  In spite of what happens later, I think the same holds true for William Hurt's character: that's actually how Philly gangsters talk and act.  I know people from that region who've been connected to the crime scene there, and Hurt simply plays it from a slightly classier standpoint...but we're talking Philly and crime, so it's not that classy.  The guy still probably never misses a NASCAR race in town, though he'd be in the premium seats with bodyguards.The sex scenes also appear very obvious and simplistic, but they're again totally realistic representations of how people (who aren't duds in the sack, that is) have sex and express those kinds of feelings.  The depictions of violence are fairly well done, and don't shy away in the least from showing what's happening, or what has happened to the dead or dying.  My primary problem with the film, however, is that if the rest of it was done as well as the sex and killing scenes, this would have been amazing.  That simplistic, obvious, and general lack of subtext to the dialog, actions, or character development just falls flat in too many places where it's needed.  There's a lot about this film I liked, but the script time and again felt like it was a first-time unpolished, underdeveloped draft by a recent film student who happened to have a bunch of really great ideas but simply couldn't fill in enough of the meat and potatoes that make up true cinema.In its totality, A History of Violence feels like it's being done to tell a moral or exercise a point.  I don't think any viewer who hasn't read reviews of the film or interviews with Cronenberg will have any idea as to what that is.  For these average viewers, the simplistic, obvious, bland quality that presents repeatedly in the film will simply fail to move them enough, especially in the second half.  And when you get to the end's kitchen table scene, the contrived avoided looks, the tear...that all sounds like it was a script that wasn't fully developed where it should have been, yet over directed and scripted out every single glance and emoting on the page when it shouldn't have, right down to that tear.  Scripts by fully developed screen writers are not like that.  It's too bad Cronenberg isn't a better writer himself, because higher-end writer/directors are able to take a script like this and either rewrite it or throw out the obvious and/or confining aspects, and that didn't happen here.I can certainly see why so many quality actors would have come on board, since so much of what they were supposed to feel and do would have been, again, obvious and spelled out, almost like a short novel.  If the ideas and character arcs are there, those qualities that would later harm the shot film if not taken out can actually make the ideas more accessible and appealing to those actors being exposed to them.  It's really too bad, because this had the makings of something special and important.  With some polishing by a better screenwriter and perhaps a quote by Richard Dawkins in the beginning to put the whole ""survival of the fittest"" theme Ebert points out on our brains for the duration, this could have been a five star work.Let me also add that Mark nnn below is totally wrong in saying the film needed more resolution and explanation of what will happen to the characters later.  That's the sort of crap Spielberg gets fixated on now...""and this character bought a condo, and these ones lived happily ever after, and blah, blah, blah.""  Part of the art form is knowing when to end it, even if that means losing a whole sequence that you've already shot, edited, and scored.  I feel bad not giving this film four stars, but there are four star films with less potential that are still executed in a better way that edge it out.  Certainly it does feel awkward giving a film like this the same grade as I gave Mission Impossible 2, but I don't see any other alternative.",3,Not enough,1129248000,"10 14, 2005",2005,4220,"['film', 'extremely', 'promising', 'spite', 'seeming', 'pretension', 'long', 'take', 'opening', 'scene', 'up', '60', '%', 'mark', 'film', 'number', 'nice', 'setups', 'pay', 'offs', 'characters', 'seem', 'very', 'simplistically', 'written', 'fact', 'how', 'most', 'people', 'actually', 'behave', 'spite', 'what', 'later', 'think', 'same', 'true', 'William', 'Hurt', 'character', 'actually', 'how', 'Philly', 'talk', 'act', 'know', 'people', 'region', 'who', ""'ve"", 'been', 'connected', 'crime', 'scene', 'there', 'Hurt', 'simply', 'slightly', 'classier', 'standpoint', ""'re"", 'talking', 'Philly', 'crime', 'not', 'classy', 'guy', 'still', 'probably', 'never', 'NASCAR', 'race', 'town', ""'d"", 'be', 'premium', 'seats', 'bodyguards.The', 'sex', 'scenes', 'also', 'appear', 'very', 'obvious', 'simplistic', ""'re"", 'again', 'totally', 'realistic', 'representations', 'how', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'duds', 'sack', 'have', 'sex', 'express', 'kinds', 'feelings', 'depictions', 'violence', 'are', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'least', 'showing', 'what', 'happening', 'happened', 'dead', 'dying', 'primary', 'problem', 'film', 'however', 'rest', 'was', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'sex', 'killing', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'amazing', 'simplistic', 'obvious', 'general', 'lack', 'subtext', 'dialog', 'actions', 'character', 'development', 'just', 'flat', 'too', 'many', 'places', 'where', 'needed', 'lot', 'film', 'liked', 'script', 'time', 'again', 'felt', 'was', 'first-time', 'unpolished', 'underdeveloped', 'draft', 'recent', 'film', 'student', 'who', 'happened', 'have', 'bunch', 'really', 'great', 'ideas', 'simply', 'could', ""n't"", 'fill', 'enough', 'meat', 'potatoes', 'make', 'up', 'true', 'cinema.In', 'totality', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'feels', 'being', 'done', 'tell', 'moral', 'exercise', 'point', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'viewer', 'who', ""n't"", 'read', 'reviews', 'film', 'interviews', 'Cronenberg', 'will', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'average', 'viewers', 'simplistic', 'obvious', 'bland', 'quality', 'repeatedly', 'film', 'will', 'simply', 'fail', 'move', 'enough', 'especially', 'second', 'half', 'when', 'get', 'end', 'kitchen', 'table', 'scene', 'contrived', 'avoided', 'looks', 'tear', 'sounds', 'was', 'script', 'was', ""n't"", 'fully', 'developed', 'where', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'yet', 'directed', 'scripted', 'out', 'single', 'glance', 'emoting', 'page', 'when', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'right', 'down', 'tear', 'Scripts', 'fully', 'developed', 'screen', 'writers', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'Cronenberg', ""n't"", 'better', 'writer', 'higher-end', 'writer/directors', 'are', 'able', 'take', 'script', 'rewrite', 'throw', 'out', 'obvious', 'and/or', 'confining', 'aspects', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'here.I', 'can', 'certainly', 'see', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'quality', 'actors', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'board', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'were', 'supposed', 'feel', 'do', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'again', 'obvious', 'spelled', 'out', 'almost', 'short', 'novel', 'ideas', 'character', 'arcs', 'are', 'there', 'qualities', 'would', 'later', 'harm', 'shot', 'film', 'not', 'taken', 'out', 'can', 'actually', 'make', 'ideas', 'more', 'accessible', 'appealing', 'actors', 'being', 'exposed', 'really', 'too', 'bad', 'had', 'makings', 'something', 'special', 'important', 'polishing', 'better', 'screenwriter', 'perhaps', 'quote', 'Richard', 'Dawkins', 'beginning', 'put', 'whole', 'survival', 'fittest', 'theme', 'Ebert', 'out', 'brains', 'duration', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'five', 'star', 'work.Let', 'also', 'add', 'Mark', 'nnn', 'below', 'totally', 'wrong', 'saying', 'film', 'needed', 'more', 'resolution', 'explanation', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'characters', 'later', 'sort', 'crap', 'Spielberg', 'fixated', 'now', 'character', 'bought', 'condo', 'ones', 'lived', 'happily', 'ever', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'Part', 'art', 'form', 'knowing', 'when', 'end', 'even', 'losing', 'whole', 'sequence', ""'ve"", 'already', 'shot', 'edited', 'scored', 'feel', 'bad', 'not', 'giving', 'film', 'four', 'stars', 'are', 'four', 'star', 'films', 'less', 'potential', 'are', 'still', 'executed', 'better', 'way', 'out', 'Certainly', 'feel', 'awkward', 'giving', 'film', 'same', 'grade', 'gave', 'Mission', 'Impossible', '2', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'other', 'alternative']",N/A

It serves as proof that Viggo Mortensen can act outside of Lord of the Rings, and features other great performances from a talented cast, including Maria Bello, Ed Harris, and William Hurt.Set in a small-town Midwest setting, the story starts with an attempted robbery in a diner (which most certainly would have ended with the death of the patrons and staff of the diner), and leads into the unraveling of main character Tom Stall's (VM) life, as big-city mobsters are drawn to the small town by the TV coverage, believing Stall to be a long-missing mobster. Tom's family structure is put under ever-increasing tension by the presence of the obsters, their allegations, and the growing suspicion within the family. Throughout, Stall fights for the family life he has built over the years.The movie is well-directed, with tension building and building, along with our sympathy for Stall. The violence shows up infrequently, but with a stacatto-like precision that does not relieve the tension, but rather adds to it. In the end, there may be hope for Stall, that his family may pull itself back together, and this is a fitting closing.Howard Shore did the soundtrack for the movie. It's a good soundtrack, but since I did know this going into the theatre, I found it a little distracting, as sometimes there are (perhaps imagined) echoes of the LOTR soundtrack.This is not a movie for young children. Once again, I was disturbed by how young children were in a movie with brutal violence.

960378,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000CQLZ0Q,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 7]","A History of Violence (David Cronenberg, 2005)The Oscars, this year as most years in the past quarter century, were widely considered a joke. One of the main reasons for this is that A History of Violence was overlooked-- robbed, many thought-- for a Best Picture nomination. I've now seen it, and I'll add my voice to those who believe it should not only have been nominated, but that it should have won.David Cronenberg's films are never less than excellent, and A History of Violence is a watershed for him in many ways-- ""his best film since"" is a phrase that was made for this film, and while every Cronenberg fan will probably give you a different movie to fill that blank, I'm going all the way back to Scanners-- and I say this as someone who has loved every movie Cronenberg has made between the two. This is not only because Cronenberg has recaptured the raw, ugly essence of his low-budget days, which had slid under the radar a tad, but because the adaptation takes a lot of risks-- and gets away with all of them.The first point is simply Cronenberg being Cronenberg; everything he touches turns to gold. The casting decisions are solid, if nothing surprising (Viggo Mortensen playing a taciturn good guy, Ed Harris playing a taciturn bad guy-- yeah, that's a real stretch), and the actors are top to bottom good performers. Cronenberg's sense of chiaroscuro is second nature by now, as is his ability to judge pace. When you see a movie directed by David Cronenberg, you're going to get your money's worth.This one is different thanks to Josh Olson. Yes, that Josh Olson. Watching this movie, you will find it very hard to believe that the man responsible for Infested came up with this adaptation (going from Infested to a Best Adapted Screenplay Academy Award nomination-- with nothing in between-- is an achievement that, I don't believe, has ever been seen in Hollywood; it would be like Traci Lords having picked up a Best Actress nom for the first role of her post-porn career). Granted, John Wagner's original graphic novel is a minor gem in its own right, but what makes the film so amazing-- to those of us who've read it, anyway-- is that Olson read the novel a few times, picked up his pen, and just went off on his own.Specifically, trying to do this without giving spoilers, there's a point about halfway through the novel/film that marks a turning point for the Stall family. At this point, the novel becomes a superhero comic, really, albeit a hugely satisfying one. Had Olson stayed true to the material, it would still have made a bang-up movie. (Truth be told, I was looking forward to seeing what Cronenberg did with the now-absent basement that forms the climax of the novel.) But at this point, Olson runs off with his own story, and the second half of the movie has not one jot to do with the second half of the novel, and it's still brilliant. Olson's screenplay gives us a darker, grimmer, and far more morally ambiguous storyline (and hero), and there's not a single place where Olson or Cronenberg bent that part of the script to cater to the original novel. This may not sound like much, but believe me, the rarity of such a thing in modern Hollywood cannot be overstated.David Cronenberg has made a truly fantastic movie here. That it got overlooked for a Best Picture nomination is, well, par for the course. **** ?",5,The REAL Best Picture of 2005,1145577600,"04 21, 2006",2006,3358,"['History', 'Violence', 'David', 'Cronenberg', '2005', 'Oscars', 'year', 'most', 'years', 'past', 'quarter', 'century', 'were', 'widely', 'considered', 'joke', 'One', 'main', 'reasons', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'was', 'overlooked', 'robbed', 'many', 'thought', 'Best', 'Picture', 'nomination', ""'ve"", 'now', 'seen', ""'ll"", 'add', 'voice', 'who', 'believe', 'should', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'should', 'have', 'won.David', 'Cronenberg', 'films', 'are', 'never', 'less', 'excellent', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'watershed', 'many', 'ways', 'best', 'film', 'phrase', 'was', 'made', 'film', 'Cronenberg', 'fan', 'will', 'probably', 'give', 'different', 'movie', 'fill', 'blank', ""'m"", 'going', 'way', 'back', 'Scanners', 'say', 'someone', 'who', 'loved', 'movie', 'Cronenberg', 'made', 'two', 'not', 'only', 'Cronenberg', 'recaptured', 'raw', 'ugly', 'essence', 'low-budget', 'days', 'had', 'slid', 'radar', 'tad', 'adaptation', 'lot', 'risks', 'away', 'them.The', 'first', 'point', 'simply', 'Cronenberg', 'being', 'Cronenberg', 'everything', 'gold', 'casting', 'decisions', 'are', 'solid', 'nothing', 'surprising', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'playing', 'taciturn', 'good', 'guy', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'playing', 'taciturn', 'bad', 'guy', 'yeah', 'real', 'stretch', 'actors', 'are', 'top', 'bottom', 'good', 'performers', 'Cronenberg', 'sense', 'chiaroscuro', 'second', 'nature', 'now', 'ability', 'judge', 'pace', 'When', 'see', 'movie', 'directed', 'David', 'Cronenberg', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'money', 'worth.This', 'one', 'different', 'thanks', 'Josh', 'Olson', 'Yes', 'Josh', 'Olson', 'Watching', 'movie', 'will', 'find', 'very', 'hard', 'believe', 'man', 'responsible', 'Infested', 'came', 'up', 'adaptation', 'going', 'Infested', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'nothing', 'achievement', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'ever', 'been', 'seen', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'be', 'Traci', 'Lords', 'having', 'picked', 'up', 'Best', 'Actress', 'nom', 'first', 'role', 'post-porn', 'career', 'Granted', 'John', 'Wagner', 'original', 'graphic', 'novel', 'minor', 'gem', 'own', 'right', 'film', 'so', 'amazing', 'who', ""'ve"", 'read', 'anyway', 'Olson', 'read', 'novel', 'few', 'times', 'picked', 'up', 'pen', 'just', 'went', 'off', 'own.Specifically', 'trying', 'do', 'giving', 'spoilers', 'point', 'halfway', 'novel/film', 'turning', 'point', 'Stall', 'family', 'point', 'novel', 'superhero', 'comic', 'really', 'hugely', 'satisfying', 'one', 'Had', 'Olson', 'stayed', 'true', 'material', 'would', 'still', 'have', 'made', 'bang-up', 'movie', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'what', 'Cronenberg', 'did', 'now-absent', 'basement', 'climax', 'novel', 'point', 'Olson', 'off', 'own', 'story', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'not', 'one', 'jot', 'do', 'second', 'half', 'novel', 'still', 'brilliant', 'Olson', 'screenplay', 'darker', 'grimmer', 'far', 'more', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'storyline', 'hero', 'not', 'single', 'place', 'where', 'Olson', 'Cronenberg', 'bent', 'part', 'script', 'cater', 'original', 'novel', 'may', 'not', 'sound', 'much', 'believe', 'rarity', 'such', 'thing', 'modern', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'overstated.David', 'Cronenberg', 'made', 'truly', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'here', 'got', 'overlooked', 'Best', 'Picture', 'nomination', 'well', 'par', 'course', '****']",N/A

960383,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000CQLZ0Q,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 2]","***1/2David Cronenberg's ""A History of Violence"" works pretty well for the first two-thirds of its running time, then slithers to pieces in a slew of implausibilities and mob-movie clich&eacute;s.Tom Stall is a genial man living an unobtrusive and generally happy life with his wife and two children in rural Indiana.  All that changes one night, however, when two armed men enter his diner, threatening to kill him, his customers and his employees.  When Tom turns the tables on the perpetrators, killing them instead, he is immediately acclaimed a hero by the townsfolk and the local media, until some mysterious men in suits arrive a few days later, implying that Tom may actually be an ex-mobster named Joey Cusack gone into hiding.  Even his wife and teenaged son begin to suspect that the man they know as husband and father may, in fact, be a complete stranger to them.In terms of its substance and style, this is one of Cronenberg's most straightforward, least esoteric works.  Derived from the graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke, the film asks the fascinating question of whether it is possible for a killer to ever truly find redemption and escape the sins of his past.  The movie is at its most compelling when concentrating on the effect the life-shattering realization has on the people closest to Tom, the almost ambivalent way in which his wife and son are both appalled and strangely titillated by discovering that the man they knew as a decent family man may instead be a cold-blooded killer.  For the most part, the film is thoughtful and well-paced, taking time to establish the details and rhythms of life in a rural setting before slowly laying out the complex melodrama that eventually ends up engulfing the characters.However, in the last half hour, the movie reveals some of the weaknesses inherent in movies derived from graphic novels.  When Tom/Joey heads back to Philadelphia for a confrontation with his mob boss brother (hammily overplayed by a balding William Hurt), the film devolves into a series of highly implausible fight scenes that look as if they have, indeed, been lifted straight off the pages of a comic book.  Thus, all the efforts to make the story ring true pretty much fly out the window at this point.  Moreover, the final scene of family reconciliation resembles one of those bad codas one finds in ""meaningful"" plays by first-year drama students.  It's too carefully worked out, too deliberately staged, and too cute by half to be truly effective.Viggo Mortensen underplays nicely in his role of a passive man who may be a powder keg of violence and emotion under his placid surface, and Maria Bello registers just the right amount of devotion and befuddlement in the part of his wife.  Ed Harris also scores as the scarred, half-blinded gangster who winds up shattering the family's idyllic life.All in all, ""A History of Violence"" is a fascinating, albeit deeply flawed, work that never lives up to its full potential.

960387,A387BD735MI50R,B000CQLZ0Q,R. Schultz,"[4, 8]","I don't know why this movie received such critical acclaim. The villains are completely improbable, comic-book characters whom the hero is forced to take on and try to defeat with stunning kung-fu action.The first scene is good. On the surface, everything in it looks casual, normal. But it has a nightmare quality. Every chair, every door seems to possess a strange, silent inner heat and heft, as if it had been forged in the hot coals of Hell and can incinerate anyone who comes too close.But when the film moves from this atmosphere pregnant with malign intent - and shifts to actual villainous confrontation - it completely loses its way and becomes simply ludicrous. There are phalanxes of avenging mobsters from Filly. There is one blood bath after another. The shoot-em-up cliche of old westerns seems to apply - all the hero's bullets hit their mark; all the villains' bullets miss or simply maim.Then the fact that this movie is largely a man's comic book fantasy is also betrayed in the relationship between husband and wife. The audience is presumably meant to be given a stake in the hero's success by virtue of his loving family life. We should root for him because he has something worthwhile to live for - the love of his wife and children. But again as has become cliche in so many movies, this love is demonstrated by the fact that his wife is drop-dead gorgeous and is given to treating her husband by acting out frolicking soft-core porn fantasies.No, the whole thing just doesn't wash. A love worth fighting for and living for to me would look more like an average couple digging up their septic drain and not hating it, because they are doing it together. Not so cinematic perhaps, but more indicative of an abiding love worth fighting for.So all we are left with here is a series of improbable events and improbable characters. There are lots of shotgun blasts and bangs, but the film's message is ultimately a whimper. If you want a movie that does the choreography of gore better - rent Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction. If you want a recent movie that gives a more realistic view of how violence is bred by subtle slights - rent Bubble.",2,Not  with a Bang,1144886400,"04 13, 2006",2006,2160,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'movie', 'received', 'such', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'villains', 'are', 'completely', 'improbable', 'comic-book', 'characters', 'whom', 'hero', 'forced', 'take', 'try', 'defeat', 'stunning', 'kung-fu', 'action.The', 'first', 'scene', 'good', 'surface', 'everything', 'casual', 'normal', 'nightmare', 'quality', 'Every', 'chair', 'door', 'possess', 'strange', 'silent', 'inner', 'heat', 'heft', 'had', 'been', 'forged', 'hot', 'coals', 'Hell', 'can', 'incinerate', 'anyone', 'who', 'too', 'close.But', 'when', 'film', 'moves', 'atmosphere', 'pregnant', 'malign', 'intent', 'shifts', 'actual', 'villainous', 'confrontation', 'completely', 'way', 'simply', 'ludicrous', 'are', 'phalanxes', 'avenging', 'mobsters', 'Filly', 'one', 'blood', 'bath', 'shoot-em-up', 'cliche', 'old', 'westerns', 'apply', 'hero', 'bullets', 'hit', 'mark', 'villains', 'bullets', 'miss', 'simply', 'maim.Then', 'fact', 'movie', 'largely', 'man', 'comic', 'book', 'fantasy', 'also', 'betrayed', 'relationship', 'husband', 'wife', 'audience', 'presumably', 'meant', 'be', 'given', 'stake', 'hero', 'success', 'virtue', 'loving', 'family', 'life', 'should', 'root', 'something', 'worthwhile', 'live', 'love', 'wife', 'children', 'again', 'become', 'cliche', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'love', 'demonstrated', 'fact', 'wife', 'drop-dead', 'gorgeous', 'given', 'treating', 'husband', 'acting', 'out', 'frolicking', 'soft-core', 'porn', 'fantasies.No', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', ""n't"", 'wash.', 'A', 'love', 'worth', 'fighting', 'living', 'would', 'look', 'more', 'average', 'couple', 'digging', 'up', 'septic', 'drain', 'not', 'hating', 'are', 'doing', 'together', 'Not', 'so', 'cinematic', 'perhaps', 'more', 'indicative', 'abiding', 'love', 'worth', 'fighting', 'for.So', 'are', 'left', 'here', 'series', 'improbable', 'events', 'improbable', 'characters', 'are', 'lots', 'shotgun', 'blasts', 'bangs', 'film', 'message', 'ultimately', 'whimper', 'want', 'movie', 'choreography', 'gore', 'better', 'rent', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'want', 'recent', 'movie', 'more', 'realistic', 'view', 'how', 'violence', 'bred', 'subtle', 'slights', 'rent', 'Bubble']",N/A

960391,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000CQLZ0Q,Samuel McKewon,"[1, 2]","David Cronenberg's ""A History of Violence"" is a watered-down version of ""Mystic River,"" with Viggo Mortensen pouring both the Tim Robbins and Sean Penn roles of that movie into one man. Mortensen does good work, and Cronenberg presents an interesting character study. But it is not the great film some critics suggest to be; the movie discards its plot to morph intoan explotation flick. Adapted from a comic book, ""A History of Violence"" does not, as ""Road To Perdition"" did, rise above the pulp. Its, blood and otherwise, are a turn off.The movie opens in Millbrook, Ind., and Tom Stall's (Mortensen) diner. Tom's a deliberate, shy man, edging toward courtly, with a supportive wife (Maria Bello), a sweet but angry son (Ashton Holmes) and a little daughter who exists mostly to be in danger. One night two mean-spirited crooks come through Tom's diner to rob the place, and probably kill the patrons. Tom rather efficiently kills them instead. He's a local hero and in the news. A few days later a black car comes around. Its occupants are gangsters from Philadelphia. Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris) is the leader of this crew, and he seems to know Tom. As a guy from Philly named Joey. Joey's the strongman who gouged Carl's left eye out, and half his face. Tom doesn't know who Joey is. Says Carl, ""I can still see out of this eye, but all I see is Joey.""Behind the mystery of Tom, Joey and Carl Fogarty is a mob boss named Richie Cusack, played by William Hurt with bemused menace. Shades of Jimmy Cagney, it's an excellent, over-the-top performance, and once we meet Richie we understand a lot more about Tom, and the final 15 minutes of ""A History of Violence"" are excellent. Visceral. Mean. Worthy of a good crime picture.The movie's weakness is its buildup, which to work requires Fogarty to hang around, a lot, when any competent gangster would have snatched Tom up in the back alley and went to work on him without announcing his intentions. The gang is a cipher, a possible reminder of Tom's past, but not able to function as mobsters would. We've seen too many ""Goodfellas"" to expect this elaborate stalking act. Cronenberg needs it to chart its effect on Tom's family, which undergoes quick changes, culminating in a scene between Mortensen and Bello that isn't enjoyable or likely.Cronenberg assembled some of these same ingredients in ""Crash,"" which skewed the world as a means of talking about theories of evil. ""A History of Violence"" is wrapped up in this argument of nature vs. nurture, of Tom and Joey. Mortensen delivers a strong two-sided performance - Tom is one innocent, convincing liar - and Bello continues solid supporting work - she'll have a shot at an Oscar nomination. But both actors are playing out theory than reality. The message is interesting.

Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) becomes the town hero after dispatching two would-be burglars with surprising ease.  His face is splashed all over the news, which brings a couple of Philadelphia mobsters into town thinking Tom is an old colleague of theirs.Viggo Mortensen does an excellent job playing the sweet family man, but there is something strange about his aloofness that makes you wonder if he is the Philly mob man Joey Cusack.  I think Viggo and Maria Bello did excellent jobs in this movie.  They played both sides of the coin - anger/love, passivity/violence, rejection/acceptance - extremely well.  It's like someone set the coin on its side and flicked it so it spun around so fast that it all blurs together.  I hadn't really heard of Maria Bello before, but this great performance (and realizing she was the alcohol advocate in Thank You for Smoking) will make me remember her name and seek out any forthcoming movies she is in.  A good role for Ed Harris.  The children was definitely not the best part of the movie and tended to overact.The plot of the movie wasn't that strong.  It was somewhat predictable and a little out there.  But it shows how strong the direction was because, in my opinion, the audience feels a very strong physical and emotional impact from the movie.

While there are two very exceptionally gross scenes, the violence unfortunately didn't fit it with the rest of the movie.  For the most part, 'A History Of Violence' is a rather boring movie that takes a long time to get going.Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) owns a diner in the quiet, rural town of Millbrook, IN, has a beautiful wife and two well-behaved children.  When two thugs enter his diner with intent to cause violence, Tom takes them out with skill and finesse (along with the first gruesome scene).  Now a local hero splashed across the news, the diner is running full speed when another thug named Fogarty (Ed Harris) shows up, acting strange and calling Tom by the name Joey Cusack.As Fogerty stalks Tom and his family, he reveals more and more about the Joey Cusack he is looking for, and Tom's claims that he is not Joey become weaker.  Also looking for Joey is Philly mob-boss Richie Cusack (John Hurt), Joey's brother, but why does Richie want to find Joey so badly?There are two love scenes in the film between Edie Stall (Mario Bello) and husband Tom that are awful.  The first during the long, boring stretch at the beginning of the film, attempting to indicate what a loving husband and father Tom is, was so silly and contrived that I didn't know whether to laugh or throw up.  The second, rougher scene on the steps only left me yawning and wondering why Edie didn't have more bruises on her back later that night.The overall feeling of the movie was that the entire film went overboard on both the calm and the cruelty in an effort to instill more shock value to Tom's flashes of brutality.  It failed, simply because it tried too hard.  A more balanced flow throughout the film would have made a better movie.  The ending to the film is flat and lifeless, horribly trite, cheesy, and abrupt.Still, 'A History Of Violence' manages to wring three stars from me for the efforts of Ed Harris, Maria Bello, John Hurt, and Viggo Mortensen for performing their roles well in spite of the script, and for the two gruesomely bloody scenes involving a jaw and a nose.

960396,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B000CQLZ0Q,Scott Schiefelbein,"[2, 9]","I have to admit that I find David Cronenberg's movies a little too ""juicy"" (not in the apple juice sense, either) to be truly enjoyable.  I like being unsettled as much as the next moviegoer, but too many of his past movies have left me a mite cold even as I admire his eccentric wit and craft.""A History of Violence"" changed much of my opinion of Mr. Cronenberg and his art.  This is an intelligent movie (no surprise there for Mr. Cronenberg, admittedly) that uses the director's trademark fixation on gore and the ""true grit"" of the human body as a stark, effective counterpoint.There are two worlds intertwined in ""A History of Violence.""  One world could have been lifted from the pages of Garrison Keillor or a family-friendly sitcom.  This the world of Tom Stall (Viggo Mortenson, looking very un-Aragornish), husband, father, and proprietor of the local diner in the middle of Everytown, Indiana.  Tom's corn-fed yet gorgeous wife Edie (Maria Bello) is a talented local lawyer, and her idea of a kinky Saturday night is to send the kids to the sitter and dress up in her old cheerleader outfit for some serious hanky-panky.The other world is the world of Joey Cusack.  Cusack was a brutal enforcer in the Philadelphia criminal underworld, but he hasn't been heard from in twenty years.That is, until two murderous thieves make the mistake of trying to knock over Tom Stall's diner one night.  Faced with murder and mayhem, Tom reacts instinctively, and unleashes murder and mayhem on his own in a way that doesn't seem quite right for the quiet family man who runs the local diner.From here, all bets are off as the link between Joey and Tom gets drawn in greater detail.  This is a first-class idea for a movie executed by first-class talent (Mortensen and Bello give excellent lead performances, and look for great ""supporting"" work by Ed Harris and William Hurt).  While there are several scenes of graphic sex and violence, this is first and foremost a movie about ideas.  And these ideas can lead you into some uncomfortable rooms.True to form, Cronenberg makes ""A History of Violence"" an unsettling experience.  Most directors are content to take the story of a child fighting off the local bully to its logical, positive conclusion that justifies your universal right to stand up for yourself.  But Cronenberg twists this slightly -- what if, by standing up for yourself, you take unfair advantage of the bully because, unknown to the bully, you have inherited a gift for causing pain and using your fists?  Is it right to beat up the guy who's bullying you if you can send him to the hospital?This is just one of the questions ""A History of Violence"" tosses at you -- and all of those questions are equally unanticipated and challenging.Cronenberg is a filmmaker uniquely capable of asking these questions and not giving you a clear answer.  In a maddening development, many loose ends are left unresolved at the end of the movie -- indeed, there are so many that I can't give the movie the five stars I want to bestow upon it.  Call me a simpleton, but I like resolution.  A few loose threads are fine, but give me something more than a family staring down at the dinner table, silently contemplating an ominous, unsettling future.",4,"Excellent, dark, disturbing ""little film"" raises questions of identity, love and nature",1143763200,"03 31, 2006",2006,3248,"['have', 'admit', 'find', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'movies', 'little', 'too', 'juicy', 'not', 'apple', 'juice', 'sense', 'either', 'be', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'being', 'unsettled', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'moviegoer', 'too', 'many', 'past', 'movies', 'have', 'left', 'mite', 'cold', 'even', 'admire', 'eccentric', 'wit', 'craft', 'History', 'Violence', 'changed', 'much', 'opinion', 'Mr.', 'Cronenberg', 'art', 'intelligent', 'movie', 'surprise', 'there', 'Mr.', 'Cronenberg', 'admittedly', 'director', 'trademark', 'fixation', 'gore', 'true', 'grit', 'human', 'body', 'stark', 'effective', 'are', 'two', 'worlds', 'intertwined', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'One', 'world', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lifted', 'pages', 'Garrison', 'Keillor', 'family-friendly', 'sitcom', 'world', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'Viggo', 'Mortenson', 'looking', 'very', 'un-Aragornish', 'husband', 'father', 'proprietor', 'local', 'diner', 'middle', 'Everytown', 'Indiana', 'Tom', 'corn-fed', 'yet', 'gorgeous', 'wife', 'Edie', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'talented', 'local', 'lawyer', 'idea', 'kinky', 'Saturday', 'night', 'send', 'kids', 'sitter', 'dress', 'up', 'old', 'cheerleader', 'outfit', 'serious', 'hanky-panky.The', 'other', 'world', 'world', 'Joey', 'Cusack', 'Cusack', 'was', 'brutal', 'enforcer', 'Philadelphia', 'criminal', 'underworld', ""n't"", 'been', 'heard', 'twenty', 'years.That', 'two', 'murderous', 'thieves', 'make', 'mistake', 'trying', 'knock', 'over', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'diner', 'one', 'night', 'Faced', 'murder', 'mayhem', 'Tom', 'instinctively', 'unleashes', 'murder', 'mayhem', 'own', 'way', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'right', 'quiet', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'local', 'diner.From', 'here', 'bets', 'are', 'link', 'Joey', 'Tom', 'drawn', 'greater', 'detail', 'first-class', 'idea', 'movie', 'executed', 'first-class', 'talent', 'Mortensen', 'Bello', 'give', 'excellent', 'lead', 'performances', 'look', 'great', 'supporting', 'work', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'William', 'Hurt', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'graphic', 'sex', 'violence', 'first', 'foremost', 'movie', 'ideas', 'ideas', 'can', 'lead', 'uncomfortable', 'rooms.True', 'form', 'Cronenberg', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'unsettling', 'experience', 'Most', 'directors', 'are', 'content', 'take', 'story', 'child', 'fighting', 'off', 'local', 'bully', 'logical', 'positive', 'conclusion', 'universal', 'right', 'stand', 'up', 'Cronenberg', 'slightly', 'what', 'standing', 'up', 'take', 'unfair', 'advantage', 'bully', 'unknown', 'bully', 'have', 'inherited', 'gift', 'causing', 'pain', 'using', 'fists', 'right', 'beat', 'up', 'guy', 'who', 'bullying', 'can', 'send', 'hospital', 'just', 'one', 'questions', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'questions', 'are', 'equally', 'unanticipated', 'challenging.Cronenberg', 'filmmaker', 'uniquely', 'capable', 'asking', 'questions', 'not', 'giving', 'clear', 'answer', 'maddening', 'development', 'many', 'loose', 'ends', 'are', 'left', 'unresolved', 'end', 'movie', 'indeed', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'want', 'bestow', 'Call', 'simpleton', 'like', 'resolution', 'few', 'loose', 'threads', 'are', 'fine', 'give', 'something', 'more', 'family', 'staring', 'down', 'dinner', 'table', 'silently', 'contemplating', 'ominous', 'unsettling', 'future']",N/A

960402,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,B000CQLZ0Q,Shashank Tripathi,"[3, 7]","Emily Dickinson once said ""Hope is that thing with feathers"". Woody Allen called his second book ""Without Feathers"" in clever disagreement. A History of Violence, I suppose, is a thing with feathers too because Cronenberg is as sharp and original as Allen, but he hasn't lost hope. This fine production is an ambient, thought-provoking, and often a downright chilling meditation on the causes of violence and its unexpected yet inevitable ramifications. At its heart, it's a story of faith and forgiveness, of the enduring ability of man to bury his past and start over.The film is studded with radiant performances. The always underrated Viggo Mortenson (because I have never once been bored by a film that had him in it) is ideally cast as Tom, a man with the gift of killing, trying to recreate his life as a simple pastoral family man. Looking almost like Gary Cooper but with a dark edge, Mortenson powerfully plays the role right on the balance between decency and denial. Even more impressive is Maria Bello, who simply electrifies as his wife Edie, especially as the revelations transform her existence. A certain stairway scene with Mortenson and Bello brings to life a visceral energy that scorches the screen. Ashton Holmes is terrific as their teenage son Jack, who must tap into his own reserves to tackle a high school bully. William Hurt is surprisingly ferocious and barely resembles the man who bumbled about as a philistine professor inOne True Thing. Ed Harris looks more feral than any other persona he has played on screen but is snug in the skin of his character.To tell too much more would be to ruin the plot, but suffice it to say that the movie echoes with flashes of unflinching violence that only Cronenberg can pull off without being gratuitous. Don't read too much into laments that it is all too brutal; it isn't. Whatever action there is, is so perfectly placed and shown with such hot-penny realism that the foreboding title falls short of what it promises. This is a distinctly subdued endeavor from the director behind the head explosions inScannersor the gooey transformations in the 1986 remake ofThe Fly.The screenplay and the pace are a throwback to Client Eastwood's Dirty Harry movies: tranquil, but with sensational interludes flowing naturally when action is necessary. Cronenberg and screenwriter Josh Olson do not slather contrivances to hit home obvious points in their story, and the ending is effectively, hauntingly open-ended. All said and done, it throws down a moral gauntlet about changing one's path in life. The manner in which each character copes with this possibility is richly presented.A word for the ""Platinum Series"" DVD package. It contains one of the best Making Of documentaries I have seen for a major release, an hour-long feature called ""Acts of Violence"". It is divided effectively into eight bits with particularly thoughtful comments from Cronenberg, Mortenson and Bello. Cronenberg also provides terrific commentary on an alternate audio track, and there are actually two extras related to a deleted fantasy scene that reflects the more typically gory side of Cronenberg's style. Having seen the end product, I must say the editing was spot-on.This one is a classic, with a message as hard-hitting, as compassionate asAmerican History Xor the Indian filmGardish.

960404,A1XEFHQZP8Y35W,B000CQLZ0Q,Silver Screen,"[9, 15]","I had heard nothing but kudos about ""A History of Violence"" and certain critics bemoaning the fact that this film did not make the Oscar cut, so I was ready to pop in the DVD and be amazed.Maybe I had my hopes just too high, but I was disappointed.The story centers on Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen), a small town family man who runs a local diner, his wife Edie (Maria Bello), and their two children, Jack (who is being bullied at school by the local high school sports hero-jackass) and Sarah (who suffers from nightmares). Basically, your average American family, at least on the surface.One day, two thugs from out of town stop in to the diner intending to rob it and kill everyone (Tom, his two employees and two teens on a date) present.  Tom ends up kicking some major butt and killing the two thugs in under thirty seconds.  The news media, in what is obviously a slow news week, descends on Tom's small town and makes him an overnight media hero.  This is where the real problems start for Tom.Before you know it, men from Philly show up (including Ed Harris, spectacular as always and in much too small of a role) claiming that Tom is really Joey Cusack from Philly, a bad guy/hitman type.Is Tom really Joey?  Did he run from the mob?  If he was Joey, is it possible that he left all that behind is now Tom?  How will his family react?The idea is a good one, with many possibilities but this is where the movie fell apart for me.  The film left a huge dramatic possibility in the scene where Jack ends up beating the tar out of the kid bullying him.  This certainly should have opened a well of conflicts in Tom - - did he pass this ""trait"" along to his son?  How could he tell him not to punch someone, given his violent background?  Did the film show Tom grappling with this conflict, maybe even a worry that Jack might end up just like Tom?  Nope.  Tom tells Jack that their family doesn't hit people, Jack makes a smart-alecked remark, Tom slaps Jack and that's the end of it.  Edie at least throws up upon learning of her husband's sordid background, and gets in a slapping, shoving and punching fight with him - - that ends up with the two of them having sex on the stairs.  Yes, that's right - - having violent sex on the stairs.  I had a hard time believing this - - not just because Edie had just seen her husband kill two men, but she had also found out about his past - - and let's not forget, that they have two children at home who could have walked in any moment.But even forgetting about those problems, the ending was a massive disappointment.  Tom returns from Philly, after having seen Richie Cusack, Joey's brother (a nice little cameo by William Hurt).  Edie, Jack and Sarah are having dinner and Tom walks in.  My first thought was that if I was Edie I would have changed the locks.  But that's just me - - Tom walks in, sits down at the dinner table, everyone looks at each other and the  movie fades out.  What??  What kind of sorry ending is THAT?  It tells us nothing - - had Edie just accepted her husband?  Are they just never going to mention this again?  Disappointing is an understatement, this ending was a complete let down and a complete sell out.Overall, other than Ed Harris, none of the acting performances jumped out at me and I really didn't understand what all the critics were doing putting this film on their Top Ten list for the year.  Definitely some better choices out there.Maybe the film might have done a little more for me had it just focused on Tom's family life and the effect this had on his family - - or maybe had Ed Harris played Tom the movie might have had a different flavor.But I'm giving it 2 stars, for Ed Harris' performance.",2,"Promising Start, Weak Finish",1142812800,"03 20, 2006",2006,3693,"['had', 'heard', 'nothing', 'kudos', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'certain', 'critics', 'bemoaning', 'fact', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'Oscar', 'cut', 'was', 'ready', 'pop', 'DVD', 'be', 'amazed.Maybe', 'had', 'hopes', 'just', 'too', 'high', 'was', 'disappointed.The', 'story', 'centers', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'small', 'town', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'local', 'diner', 'wife', 'Edie', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'two', 'children', 'Jack', 'who', 'being', 'bullied', 'school', 'local', 'high', 'school', 'sports', 'hero-jackass', 'Sarah', 'who', 'nightmares', 'Basically', 'average', 'American', 'family', 'least', 'surface.One', 'day', 'two', 'thugs', 'town', 'stop', 'diner', 'intending', 'rob', 'kill', 'everyone', 'Tom', 'two', 'employees', 'two', 'teens', 'date', 'present', 'Tom', 'up', 'kicking', 'major', 'butt', 'killing', 'two', 'thugs', 'thirty', 'seconds', 'news', 'media', 'what', 'obviously', 'slow', 'news', 'week', 'Tom', 'small', 'town', 'overnight', 'media', 'hero', 'where', 'real', 'problems', 'start', 'Tom.Before', 'know', 'men', 'Philly', 'show', 'up', 'including', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'spectacular', 'always', 'much', 'too', 'small', 'role', 'claiming', 'Tom', 'really', 'Joey', 'Cusack', 'Philly', 'bad', 'guy/hitman', 'type.Is', 'Tom', 'really', 'Joey', 'Did', 'run', 'mob', 'was', 'Joey', 'possible', 'left', 'behind', 'now', 'Tom', 'How', 'will', 'family', 'react', 'idea', 'good', 'one', 'many', 'possibilities', 'where', 'movie', 'fell', 'apart', 'film', 'left', 'huge', 'dramatic', 'possibility', 'scene', 'where', 'Jack', 'up', 'beating', 'tar', 'kid', 'bullying', 'certainly', 'should', 'have', 'opened', 'well', 'conflicts', 'Tom', 'did', 'pass', 'trait', 'son', 'How', 'could', 'tell', 'not', 'punch', 'someone', 'given', 'violent', 'background', 'Did', 'film', 'show', 'Tom', 'grappling', 'conflict', 'maybe', 'even', 'worry', 'Jack', 'might', 'end', 'up', 'just', 'Tom', 'Nope', 'Tom', 'Jack', 'family', ""n't"", 'hit', 'people', 'Jack', 'smart-alecked', 'remark', 'Tom', 'Jack', 'end', 'Edie', 'least', 'throws', 'up', 'learning', 'husband', 'sordid', 'background', 'slapping', 'shoving', 'punching', 'fight', 'up', 'two', 'having', 'sex', 'stairs', 'Yes', 'right', 'having', 'violent', 'sex', 'stairs', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'not', 'just', 'Edie', 'had', 'just', 'seen', 'husband', 'kill', 'two', 'men', 'had', 'also', 'found', 'out', 'past', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'have', 'two', 'children', 'home', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'walked', 'moment.But', 'even', 'forgetting', 'problems', 'ending', 'was', 'massive', 'disappointment', 'Tom', 'Philly', 'having', 'seen', 'Richie', 'Cusack', 'Joey', 'brother', 'nice', 'little', 'cameo', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Edie', 'Jack', 'Sarah', 'are', 'having', 'dinner', 'Tom', 'walks', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'was', 'Edie', 'would', 'have', 'changed', 'locks', 'just', 'Tom', 'walks', 'sits', 'down', 'dinner', 'table', 'everyone', 'other', 'movie', 'out', 'What', 'What', 'kind', 'sorry', 'ending', 'nothing', 'had', 'Edie', 'just', 'accepted', 'husband', 'Are', 'just', 'never', 'going', 'mention', 'again', 'Disappointing', 'understatement', 'ending', 'was', 'complete', 'let', 'down', 'complete', 'sell', 'out.Overall', 'other', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'none', 'acting', 'performances', 'jumped', 'out', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'critics', 'were', 'doing', 'putting', 'film', 'Top', 'Ten', 'list', 'year', 'Definitely', 'better', 'choices', 'out', 'there.Maybe', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'little', 'more', 'had', 'just', 'focused', 'Tom', 'family', 'life', 'effect', 'had', 'family', 'maybe', 'had', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'played', 'Tom', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'different', 'flavor.But', ""'m"", 'giving', '2', 'stars', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'performance']",N/A

And A History of Violence is definitely Cronenberg's best submission since Dead Ringers back in 1988.Viggo Mortenson (who plays Tom Stall...or is it really Joey Cusack???) is awesome, believable and keeps the audience glued to the screen on which he is in almost every scene. He's cleaned up and hardly even resembles his character from the Lord of the Rings Trilogy (he was the scraggly looking warrior Aragorn in Rings). He portrays his character flawlessly and makes the underlying plot seem very realistic.Basically the movie is about how mild mannered Tom Stall (Mortenson) thwarts a robbery by couple of thugs and disposes of them almost effortlessly, which gains national news headlines. A day later Tom gets a visit from a scary looking Ed Harris who accuses Tom of actually being a different person with A History of Violence that promises to bring Tom big trouble. And the rest of the movie is the suspenseful tale of how Tom deals with this new threat to his life.Overall, it's a good movie to rent. A Golden Globe nomination for Best Picture seems a bit excessive to me for such a simple story. Clearly there would have been no movie if the supposedly ""well organized"" bad guys just snuck into town and whacked Tom instead of announcing their arrival with pompous fanfare, and that's a pretty large hole that's hard to overlook.Otherwise, A History of Violence is a sure thing for suspense/thriller fans.

This film is almost a reverse of that, there is nobody more boring and down to earth as Viggo Mortenson's character and his familly. A quiet self-effacing man with an aggressively pacifist son and a devoted wife living in Suburbia. But this character is a [...], a re-invention of the old Joey who was a ruthless nihilistic killer. Throughout the movie the new Joey is presented with challenges to his new persona and these come from his past and while he meets each of them fully his new gentle persona slowly starts to erode a bit. Joey himself is like 'The Bride' from Kill Bill, only instead of seeking revenge he is protecting himself from it. When attacked he can certainly handle himself, and the violence is very strong. There is also a subplot involving two wandering killers, in the beginning when one of them shoots a little girl and then the camera changes to show Joey we see a great resemblance between the young killer and Joey - no doubt done deliberately it had me thinking the young killer WAS Joey in his youth, i think Cronenberg cast a young actor with a resemblance to Mortenson for this very purpose, it is perhaps the only really visceral image of Joey in his violent youth we are allowed to have (even if it is illusory). I do think the film was not fleshed out enough, not enough happens to keep the viewers' interest and Joey himself remains something of an enigma right up the end. I kind of like a 'Taxi driver' interpretation for the whole film, perhaps Joey is deluding himself about all these violent encounters with super villains? Perhaps he is an ordinary guy in an ordinary job with an ordinary familly and wishes he were someone else? Evidence for this includes the almost comic book nature of his martial prowess in fighting the villains - his 'history of violence' serving his fantasy as a badge of machismo and his good guy persona acting in self-defence killing bad guys all points to fantasy, the ending were he just walks in and sits down to his familly (who are giving him funny looks) slots in as well.

Tom Stall, played by Mortensen, the head of the household, owns a diner, and tries to keep his family out of trouble, at one point chastising his son Jack, played by newcomer Ashton Holmes, for beating up his bully. One night out of the blue, Tom and his workers at the diner are encountered with two vicious killers who intend to hold up the place and kill everyone inside, Tom reacts and ends up killing both men in cold blood. The town instantly revere Tom as a local hero. His 15 minutes of fame costs him his privacy and security when a mob led by Carl Fogarty, played by Harris, begin stalking Tom and his family assuming that he is a notorious ex-mobster from Philadelphia that he insists he isn't.The movie is engaging and will keep you wondering what will happen next. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film.

Don't expect any exploding heads or women giving birth to giant maggots this time around.  Now, Cronenberg's theme of the changing body is on the psychological level.  Personally what I really liked about this movie is how Cronenberg took a realistic approach to the subject matter.  I mean, this could have so easily become a cornball action film in the Bourne Identity mold, but thankfully that doesn't happen.  The situation and how the family handles it are very true to what would probably happen.  It's actually quite emotional at times, and considering the premise is a little far out, I'd say that's a good directing job.  Cronenberg does let a little of old self come through now and again, adding a just a touch of of an ""eeew"" factor to the violence.  Plus, it really isn't often in films nowdays to see a guy going down on a woman.  It's not really important to the film, just an observation.  It may not be Cronenberg's best film, but it's very well done, and the fact that Cronenberg scored a hit with this might show hope for the future of Hollywood films...but I doubt it.",4,"A Different Cronenberg, But He's Still Got It!",1145750400,"04 23, 2006",2006,1144,"['History', 'Violence', 'quite', 'different', 'Cronenberg', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'exploding', 'heads', 'women', 'giving', 'birth', 'giant', 'maggots', 'time', 'Now', 'Cronenberg', 'theme', 'changing', 'body', 'psychological', 'level', 'Personally', 'what', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'how', 'Cronenberg', 'took', 'realistic', 'approach', 'subject', 'matter', 'mean', 'could', 'have', 'so', 'easily', 'become', 'cornball', 'action', 'film', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'mold', 'thankfully', ""n't"", 'happen', 'situation', 'how', 'family', 'are', 'very', 'true', 'what', 'would', 'probably', 'happen', 'actually', 'quite', 'emotional', 'times', 'considering', 'premise', 'little', 'far', ""'d"", 'say', 'good', 'directing', 'job', 'Cronenberg', 'let', 'little', 'old', 'self', 'come', 'now', 'again', 'adding', 'just', 'touch', 'eeew', 'factor', 'violence', 'really', ""n't"", 'often', 'films', 'nowdays', 'see', 'guy', 'going', 'down', 'woman', 'not', 'really', 'important', 'film', 'just', 'observation', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Cronenberg', 'best', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'fact', 'Cronenberg', 'scored', 'hit', 'might', 'show', 'hope', 'future', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'doubt']",N/A

960416,A3O9S9HQMKCUJR,B000CQLZ0Q,"Stephen Broome ""Anti-Noodling Consortium""","[13, 19]","In A History of Violence, Viggo Mortensen stars as Tom Stall, an everyday hard working diner owner in a small town miles away from anything of significance. After a pair of traveling criminals attempt to rob his diner however, his life changes with the ensuing media coverage and celebration of his bravery.But was it bravery or a manifestation of the movie's title? How did a small town coffee jockey get the drop on two hardened, ruthless criminals, desperate for money? This question is asked by Carl Fogarty, who comes to town armed with two mafia musclemen and the idea that ""Tom"" is actually a former mob criminal from Philadelphia who owes a number of debts to the former partners he betrayed back home. The question of whether or not this past is real or imagined by the men is revealed later, but the film is about much more than that.As expected Cronenberg's directing is outstanding. During action his scenes are framed with a sort of odd devotion to centering and stillness followed by graphic imagery of the damage done. It's not gratuitous (that's not the point) it's simply honest and direct, a sort of cold impartial presentation of violence rarely seen in movies. Of more relevance, and the real focus of the story, is Cronenberg's interest in just what the title says. Are we repulsed equally by violence that protects us? That question is answered brilliantly in the movie's final scene, a microcosm of society's falsehoods as it relates to aggression and the double standard of public morality. As a method to this end, Cronenberg refuses to give approval to anything or anyone. Tacit consent is neither judged nor explained, it simply exists in the story as a way of life for those who accept the nature of things they don't participate in. As a result, violence and passivity are given the same platform. We also analyze the generational effect of violence, how it is passed from one party to another, whether it is learned or something people simply can or cannot perform, and if it is in fact the appropriate solution to certain problems with unreasonable people. When talking stops after all the merits of violence or lack thereof seem to be in the black and white terms of ""now"" and that is presented flawlessly here.The acting is outstanding throughout. Ed Harris as usual has the most magnetic presence and here is given an eye injury and an accent to draw on which is like giving Mickey Rourke his recent Sin City role. Mortensen and Maria Bello are dynamic and believable together even as their relationship undergoes transitions, and their early scenes of intimacy are not only great to watch but serve as a great foundation for the last two-thirds of the film. William Hurt appears with a performance that could've been in Miller's Crossing, a sort of fragmented mob boss that chews scenery in a very enjoyable way. Last but not least is Viddo's individual performance, a sort of blank, unreadable slate that belies a sort of honest dishonesty perfectly.It must be said of course that this film is based on the graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke. So when you are tempted to refer to comic books as a genre remember: this story, Ghost World, Road to Perdition and X-Men are all taken from the same source. It's a medium, not a genre.Original review here: [...]",5,I'm a big fan of this movie,1138147200,"01 25, 2006",2006,3301,"['A', 'History', 'Violence', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'everyday', 'hard', 'working', 'diner', 'owner', 'small', 'town', 'miles', 'away', 'anything', 'significance', 'pair', 'traveling', 'criminals', 'attempt', 'rob', 'diner', 'however', 'life', 'changes', 'ensuing', 'media', 'coverage', 'celebration', 'bravery.But', 'was', 'manifestation', 'movie', 'title', 'How', 'did', 'small', 'town', 'coffee', 'jockey', 'get', 'drop', 'two', 'hardened', 'ruthless', 'criminals', 'desperate', 'money', 'question', 'asked', 'Carl', 'Fogarty', 'who', 'town', 'armed', 'two', 'mafia', 'musclemen', 'idea', 'Tom', 'actually', 'former', 'mob', 'criminal', 'Philadelphia', 'who', 'number', 'debts', 'former', 'partners', 'betrayed', 'back', 'home', 'question', 'not', 'past', 'real', 'imagined', 'men', 'revealed', 'later', 'film', 'about', 'much', 'more', 'that.As', 'expected', 'Cronenberg', 'directing', 'outstanding', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'framed', 'sort', 'odd', 'devotion', 'centering', 'stillness', 'followed', 'graphic', 'imagery', 'damage', 'done', 'not', 'gratuitous', 'not', 'point', 'simply', 'honest', 'direct', 'sort', 'cold', 'impartial', 'presentation', 'violence', 'rarely', 'seen', 'movies', 'more', 'relevance', 'real', 'focus', 'story', 'Cronenberg', 'interest', 'just', 'what', 'title', 'Are', 'repulsed', 'equally', 'violence', 'question', 'answered', 'brilliantly', 'movie', 'final', 'scene', 'microcosm', 'society', 'falsehoods', 'aggression', 'double', 'standard', 'public', 'morality', 'method', 'end', 'Cronenberg', 'give', 'approval', 'anything', 'anyone', 'Tacit', 'consent', 'judged', 'explained', 'simply', 'story', 'way', 'life', 'who', 'accept', 'nature', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'participate', 'result', 'violence', 'passivity', 'are', 'given', 'same', 'platform', 'also', 'analyze', 'generational', 'effect', 'violence', 'how', 'passed', 'one', 'party', 'learned', 'something', 'people', 'simply', 'can', 'can', 'not', 'perform', 'fact', 'appropriate', 'solution', 'certain', 'problems', 'unreasonable', 'people', 'When', 'talking', 'stops', 'merits', 'violence', 'lack', 'thereof', 'seem', 'be', 'black', 'white', 'terms', 'now', 'presented', 'flawlessly', 'here.The', 'acting', 'outstanding', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'usual', 'most', 'magnetic', 'presence', 'here', 'given', 'eye', 'injury', 'accent', 'draw', 'giving', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'recent', 'Sin', 'City', 'role', 'Mortensen', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'are', 'dynamic', 'believable', 'together', 'even', 'relationship', 'undergoes', 'transitions', 'early', 'scenes', 'intimacy', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'watch', 'serve', 'great', 'foundation', 'last', 'two-thirds', 'film', 'William', 'Hurt', 'performance', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Miller', 'Crossing', 'sort', 'fragmented', 'mob', 'boss', 'scenery', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'Viddo', 'individual', 'performance', 'sort', 'blank', 'unreadable', 'slate', 'sort', 'honest', 'dishonesty', 'perfectly.It', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'course', 'film', 'based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'John', 'Wagner', 'Vince', 'Locke', 'So', 'when', 'are', 'tempted', 'refer', 'comic', 'books', 'genre', 'remember', 'story', 'Ghost', 'World', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'X-Men', 'are', 'taken', 'same', 'source', 'medium', 'not', 'genre.Original', 'review', 'here', '[', ']']",N/A

The main plot it seems is what most people are focusing on (because they are linear thinkers). It involves an ex-hitman character Tom Stall who is forced to confront his history with an act of violence (that he initiated in his past). However the sub plot is the most important and is pure Cronenberg. It deals with the fact that when two individuals commit to marriage, they are not only marrying the person that they think they know, but also that persons past. What that individual decides to share about their past with their new partner is truly up to them. The partner may never know the true person. This is the case with Tom and Edie's marriage. He never planned on telling her about his past until he was forced into a violent confrontation in his diner. That confrontation is the catalyst that resurrects his past life. I enjoyed Tom's references to being ""Born Again"" only when he married Edie (Maria Bello) and the obvious visual references to forgiveness of sins with the matching crucifixes they both wear around their necks is brilliant. Also, his selection of his new name was awesome, Tom Stall. Doesn't the word Stall mean to delay? I think that this sub plot is what audiences obviously missed. They are eithier to scared to face their own history or confront their partners about their past. Nothing destroys a relationship faster then a newly discovered secret. If I am right then Cronenberg has succeeded by forcing the audience to take a good look at their own history and their partners (or potential partners). The silence at the end of the film I felt was awesome. The characters close-up shots of their facial expressions leaves the audience with an uneasy feeling of what the kind of effect Tom's history has had on the family and if they will they ever be able to accept this person they do not know.",5,The Real Plot Of This Film,1131148800,"11 5, 2005",2005,1894,"['History', 'Violence', 'two', 'plots', 'main', 'plot', 'sub', 'plot', 'main', 'plot', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'focusing', 'are', 'linear', 'thinkers', 'ex-hitman', 'character', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'who', 'forced', 'confront', 'history', 'act', 'violence', 'initiated', 'past', 'However', 'sub', 'plot', 'most', 'important', 'pure', 'Cronenberg', 'fact', 'when', 'two', 'individuals', 'commit', 'marriage', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'marrying', 'person', 'think', 'know', 'also', 'persons', 'past', 'What', 'individual', 'decides', 'share', 'past', 'new', 'partner', 'truly', 'up', 'partner', 'may', 'never', 'know', 'true', 'person', 'case', 'Tom', 'Edie', 'marriage', 'never', 'planned', 'telling', 'past', 'was', 'forced', 'violent', 'confrontation', 'diner', 'confrontation', 'catalyst', 'past', 'life', 'enjoyed', 'Tom', 'references', 'being', 'Born', 'Again', 'only', 'when', 'married', 'Edie', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'obvious', 'visual', 'references', 'forgiveness', 'sins', 'matching', 'crucifixes', 'wear', 'necks', 'brilliant', 'Also', 'selection', 'new', 'name', 'was', 'awesome', 'Tom', 'Stall', ""n't"", 'word', 'Stall', 'mean', 'delay', 'think', 'sub', 'plot', 'what', 'obviously', 'missed', 'are', 'eithier', 'scared', 'face', 'own', 'history', 'confront', 'partners', 'past', 'Nothing', 'relationship', 'faster', 'then', 'newly', 'discovered', 'secret', 'am', 'right', 'then', 'Cronenberg', 'succeeded', 'forcing', 'audience', 'take', 'good', 'look', 'own', 'history', 'partners', 'potential', 'partners', 'silence', 'end', 'film', 'felt', 'was', 'awesome', 'characters', 'close-up', 'shots', 'facial', 'expressions', 'audience', 'uneasy', 'feeling', 'what', 'kind', 'effect', 'Tom', 'history', 'had', 'family', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'accept', 'person', 'do', 'not', 'know']",N/A
960419,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,B000CQLZ0Q,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[2, 4]","""A History of Violence"" is an odd duck, a kind of art house film dressed up as a gritty thriller.  While he never really establishes it as either, director David Cronenberg sometimes comes close in what often feels like a nod to both Sam Peckinpah and Ernest Hemingway.  The strengths of the film include abrupt scenes of violence, not quite as visceral as Peckinpah in  his heyday but certainly effective in a latex-y, shiny sort of way, and a scene where a picked-on teenager turns the tables on oppressors.  The first of two sex scenes is both goofy and touching and will no doubt shock a few viewers in flyover country; the second is in the vein of the infamous rape scene in ""Straw Dogs,"" though it doesn't leave us quite as shaken.  Much like the film itself.  The story concerns - shades of Hemingway's ""The Killers"" -- a small town diner counter man, here named Tom Stall (capable Viggo Mortensen, combining the dead eyes of Jon Voight and the reptilian charm of Bill Pullman), who becomes a hero after efficiently dispatching two psychopaths (including Lance Hendrickson clone Stephen McHattie) bent on robbery and worse.  Cascading events force Stall to confront a past that may or may not include his own evil ways.  Sexy Maria Bello is his conflicted wife, Ed Harris provides his usual steady menace as middle management, and William Hurt continues to try to reinvent himself, this time as a unredeemable monster with the funnier quips and a parody of an East Coast accent.  While the script often wanders into B-movie territory with predictable lines and setups and a too-fast climax, and actors occasionally seem to be phoning it in, ""A History of Violence"" should keep your attention, especially the first half, where Cronenberg allows things to simmer.

960420,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B000CQLZ0Q,Steve,"[3, 4]","I want to start off by saying that some of the one-star negative reviews are so over-the-top hateful and angry that I wonder if Cronenberg personally attacked these people. Some of the samplings include the oft-mentioned payola conspiracy, the one charming review that requested all participants in the movie commit suicide to pay for their sins, and the others who feel that they have been personally harmed via the ninety minutes of their life spent watching this movie. Beyond the obvious stupidity of such claims, they are also so full of self-righteousness that it enrages me. It's one thing to dislike a movie and give solid evidentiary reasons. It's another to insult those who disagree with you. Then again, welcome to the cultural climate that the Limbaugh generation has spawned. When someone disagrees, shout louder than they do and insult them. Hey, Fox News has built a media monster from such a philosophy.A History of Violence was a movie I enjoyed. It was recommended by a friend as we discussed movies we liked, and having enjoyed Eastern Promises and the work of Viggo Mortensen, I thought it would be good. I wasn't disappointed. One of the complaints about AHOV is that it lacks good dialogue or believable characters. I disagree. How can you even attempt to know what real mobsters are like, or what it would be like to be Joey/Tom? Personal experience? Aren't you basing your judgments on movie clich&eacute;s themselves? Do you compare the mobsters in this movie to Vito Corleone or Tony Soprano? I can't even begin to figure out how you judge what a person in Tom Stall's shoes would be like or do. Given that I have nothing that comes close to prior knowledge to build inferences upon, I found these characters to be as credible as I might imagine they could be. Furthermore, the starkness and lack of highly quotable or memorable lines is indicative of the reality of our lives which generally lack in quotable moments. How many times a day, month, or lifetime do you say profound things or act with the high integrity, moral strength, or rapier wit of movie heroes? Probably a lot less than you or I waffle with uncertainty, spout tired chestnuts, or rely on stolen lines from our favorite movies.  I find the torn and confused Edie to be more realistic than if she were the hackneyed Meryl Streep/Julia Roberts/et al Hollywood heroine who stands tall in the face of her problems. I found the frustrated and angry teen son to be plausible in his explosive payback to the punks who torment him. I found the small-town cop who is only trying to do his job and yet maintain his place in the community to be on target. And lastly, I found Mortensen's understated portrayal to be perfect for such a task. Quietly seething, fighting that part of him he wishes were dead, wanting nothing but a return to the life he had before the two thugs entered his diner, and treading fragilely on the brittle surface of a life now cracked and threatened by a past that has finally caught up to him; Viggo does as good a job as I can imagine any actor doing. He fails to overact, plays it true, and allows us to see the dynamic between the two lives that violently come together for him.AHOV is not the greatest movie I have ever seen, but it doesn't have to be. It is a solid piece of movie making that kept me riveted, had me questioning what was going to happen next, and gave me an ending that was satisfactory because it gave no specific answers.It is often wisely recommended that you borrow/rent a movie before buying and I agree with that. I liked this one and I think you will as well. If not, give it back and try something else.

Threatening to mete out extreme violence against the occupants of the diner the thugs don't realize who they've come up against for, as we, together with his wife and two kids, become gradually aware, Tom is not quite who he first appears to be.  Unsurprisingly, he's feted as a hero and garners, as a result of his exploits, unwanted media attention.  This brings him to the notice of decidedly shady characters from his past from whom he thought he'd escaped, who, ultimately, force him to do what a man's got to do.Within minutes of the film's opening we see Tom's daughter being comforted by her parents and older brother following a nightmare featuring `monsters'.  Naturally, her parents tell her that `there are no such things as monsters', a lie only too soon to be proven.  Cronenberg examines, in this film, to what extent we can be redeemed from the consequences of our past and the extent to which our behaviour is determined by the actions of others.  It's far from faultless and there are logical inconsistencies in the plot outlined elsewhere.

Then, the people who recommended it to me found out!  They sadly advised me I had not given it enough time, and since I'm always open to rethink an original impression, I looked at it again.  This is how I review it after the break point began to allow the concept of the story to come across:Viggo Mortensen does a credible job as the lead character of Tom Stahl - who is carrying a deep secret around with him, believing he has escaped the curse of his family ties to an unsavory association with a crime family.  He is suited to the life, all right, but has rejected it as something he wants to escape.  He has successfully suppressed and kept under control the demon within him, but that becomes no longer possible as his past catches up with him; sadly it catches up only because he has done a good samaritan act and his  picture makes the paper.  It isn't long before his new life begins to come apart at the seams when some old contacts come to town to take care of some unfinished business with the man we now suspect is a Joey, not a Tom.The heat is turned up and is relentless; his every waking moment is dogged with the knowledge that these two goons are capable of extreme danger to his family in their quest for him.  In that regard, Ed Harris carries his role well as the maimed gangster out to exact his revenge, and William Hurt comes in at the end to cap it off as Joey's nasty, sociopathic brother, who has been embarrassed by his little brother's defection.As his wife begins to tumble to the truth, she is repulsed; another sex scene of an entirely different variety takes place on a stairwell, sans the cheerleading outfit;  and the expression of Tom Stahl suddenly reverts to Joey The Bad Boy in one of the best moments of the film; Mortensen pulls it off extremely well there, it's a total transformation flashing openly upon his countenance as he abandons his charade; because all of it is out of control once more and ""everybody who matters KNOWS"".The curious connection between the son who suddenly breaks under the bullying and severely beats his tormenter past the point of normal self-defense suddenly becomes more viable in your take about the whole thing too.  Blood will tell.  ""We turn into our parents"", and the boy learns the truth about both his father and about himself simultaneously.The ending is ambiguous; nothing is solved, but nothing has been cut entirely off either.  There is a chance, however small, to cling to.It doesn't say, but I suspect that the cheerleading outfit has been relegated to the mothballs unit.",4,"""Pal Joey?""",1242777600,"05 20, 2009",2009,2979,"['movie', 'was', 'recommended', 'set', 'up', '15', 'minutes', 'only', 'thing', 'happened', 'was', 'naughty', 'sex', 'scene', 'lead', 'man', 'Tom', 'Stahl', 'wife', 'who', 'donned', 'cheerleader', 'outfit', 'bring', 'back', 'youthful', 'moment', 'did', ""n't"", 'share', 'together', 'then-difficult-to-connect', 'conflicts', 'wimpy', 'son', 'bullies', 'school', 'finally', 'gave', 'up', 'waste', 'time', 'Then', 'people', 'who', 'recommended', 'found', 'out', 'sadly', 'advised', 'had', 'not', 'given', 'enough', 'time', ""'m"", 'always', 'open', 'rethink', 'original', 'impression', 'looked', 'again', 'how', 'review', 'break', 'point', 'began', 'allow', 'concept', 'story', 'come', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'credible', 'job', 'lead', 'character', 'Tom', 'Stahl', 'who', 'carrying', 'deep', 'secret', 'believing', 'escaped', 'curse', 'family', 'ties', 'unsavory', 'association', 'crime', 'family', 'suited', 'life', 'right', 'rejected', 'something', 'escape', 'successfully', 'suppressed', 'kept', 'control', 'demon', 'no', 'longer', 'possible', 'past', 'up', 'sadly', 'up', 'only', 'done', 'good', 'samaritan', 'act', 'picture', 'paper', ""n't"", 'long', 'new', 'life', 'come', 'apart', 'seams', 'when', 'old', 'contacts', 'come', 'town', 'take', 'care', 'unfinished', 'business', 'man', 'now', 'suspect', 'Joey', 'not', 'Tom.The', 'heat', 'turned', 'up', 'relentless', 'waking', 'moment', 'dogged', 'knowledge', 'two', 'goons', 'are', 'capable', 'extreme', 'danger', 'family', 'quest', 'regard', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'role', 'well', 'maimed', 'gangster', 'exact', 'revenge', 'William', 'Hurt', 'end', 'cap', 'off', 'Joey', 'nasty', 'sociopathic', 'brother', 'who', 'been', 'embarrassed', 'little', 'brother', 'defection.As', 'wife', 'tumble', 'truth', 'repulsed', 'sex', 'scene', 'entirely', 'different', 'variety', 'place', 'stairwell', 'cheerleading', 'outfit', 'expression', 'Tom', 'Stahl', 'suddenly', 'Joey', 'Bad', 'Boy', 'one', 'best', 'moments', 'film', 'Mortensen', 'off', 'extremely', 'well', 'there', 'total', 'transformation', 'flashing', 'openly', 'countenance', 'charade', 'control', 'once', 'more', 'everybody', 'who', 'KNOWS', 'curious', 'connection', 'son', 'who', 'suddenly', 'bullying', 'severely', 'beats', 'tormenter', 'point', 'normal', 'self-defense', 'suddenly', 'more', 'viable', 'take', 'whole', 'thing', 'too', 'Blood', 'will', 'tell', 'turn', 'parents', 'boy', 'truth', 'father', 'simultaneously.The', 'ending', 'ambiguous', 'nothing', 'solved', 'nothing', 'been', 'cut', 'entirely', 'chance', 'however', 'small', 'cling', 'to.It', ""n't"", 'say', 'suspect', 'cheerleading', 'outfit', 'been', 'relegated', 'mothballs', 'unit']",N/A

The ones involving conflict or payback are top notch, as are some of the more 'human' ones; But for example, I found the 'bully' stuff kind of 'ABC Afterschool Special'-like, but found the end result of that storyline very satisfying; Also in the like, I found the confrontation between Viggo and Harris(w/goons by his side...)brilliant, but the other end w/Hurt not so much. It was almost like you wished the movie had ended with the more powerful scene, not that the other wasn't creative. It just had less of an impact.

I was sure that with William Hurt,  Ed Harris, Viggo Mortensen,  and Maria Bello,  this was going to live up to its hype and be,  as it was called,  ""The Best Film of 2005.""  Or at least one of the best,  but sadly enough,  I don't feel that was the case.  I shouldn't be surprised,  I have yet to like a thing directed by David Cronenberg,  who in my opinion is highly overrated and always has been.The first part of the movie was stunning,  with Mortensen as the pleasant,  soft-spoken family man.  Had the movie been a look at the horrible impact it can have on a family to experience violence and be forced to murder to save self and others,  it would have continued to be so.  But then it degenerated into a mobster movie (complete with stupid ""fuggitabowtit"" type accents),  with our decent hero so effortlessly becoming the vicious hood he supposedly left behind,  that it seemed like the first part of the movie had never taken place.  The violence ceased to be shocking and out of place,  and just became a cartoon,  as Tom/Joey killed bad guy after bad guy like someone in a cheap ninja movie.What I can't figure out is why so many incredibly talented people wasted their time in a movie that started off good and turned into complete dreck.  The performances were wonderful,  with the exception of the child who played the daughter.  She was plenty cute,  but such a rotten actor that she had to be related to somebody with bucks.  I don't think I'm being too hard on her,  we've all seen small children who can act circles around adults,  and this film could have used one.  The end was disappointing also,  with Tom/Joey just coming in and sitting down at the table without a word.  One thinks that now that he's gone down this road,  he can't go back again,  and that at least would have been a slightly profound note on which to wrap it all up,  but who knows,  maybe he'll go back to serving up coffee at the diner,  back to speaking Hoosier instead of Philly.

This is probably my favorite movie of 2005 and with good reason. It gets better every time I watch it. The acting on all counts is really, really good. The story is simple on the surface but thought provoking and incredibly multilayered underneath. The music by Howard Shore fits incredibly well and is worth owning the soundtrack for (well, I'm an unapologetic Howards Shore fan and just about anything he does is worth owning to me).  The cinematography is top notch and Cronenberg's direction is assured in his usual low key style. It's almost completely different from the original source material (which in itself is well worth a read) but the changes made are just right for the film.I'm a bit disappointed at the overall reaction to this film. I think this was one of the better releases to come out in recent times, yet many people scoffed at it's content. There's much to be said about this film but I think the best thing about it is like I said before, it gets better every time I watch it. Hopefully it will for you as well.NOTE: The DVD for this film has a great collection of extras. The picture and sound are well put together.

Ed Harris does a remarkable supporting job as Carl Fogarty - a villian from Stall's past.Enjoy!",5,More a commentary on violence,1144886400,"04 13, 2006",2006,972,"['history', 'violence', 'story', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'small-town', 'diner', 'owner', 'living', 'American', 'Dream', 'Boringsville', 'USA', 'too', 'perfect', 'hero', 'foiling', 'theft', 'could', ""'ve"", 'escalated', 'murder', 'killing', 'perpetrators', 'back', 'Tom', 'past', 'as', 'well', 'future', 'watching', 'violence', 'envelop', 'family', 'screenwriters', 'take', 'line', 'making', 'agree', 'violence', 'only', 'show', 'truism', 'violence', 'begets', 'violence', 'sense', 'more', 'explicit', 'Hollywoodized', 'telling', 'message', 'Beat', 'Kitano', 'Violent', 'Cop', 'CD', 'extras', 'help', 'message', 'interesting', 'annecdote', 'titled', 'Too', 'Commerical', 'Cannes', 'course', 'how', 'well', 'did', 'there', 'cast', 'point', 'view', 'Viggo', 'surprisingly', 'vestage', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'fully', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'remarkable', 'supporting', 'job', 'Carl', 'Fogarty', 'villian', 'Stall', 'past.Enjoy']",N/A
960441,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000CQLZ0Q,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[4, 6]","Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) lives with his wife Edie (Maria Bello) and their two children, Jack (Ashton Holmes) and Sarah (Heidi Hayes) in a small town in Indiana. Tom runs a diner, everyone in town knows him, he and Edie have the occasional date night and they live a very quiet life. One day, two killers on a spree, enter the diner and threaten customers and his waitress. Tom swiftly, and surprisingly, puts the two killers out of commission. Dubbed a local hero, every news channel runs a story on the heroic event, plastering Tom's picture all over the television. These stories attract the attention of Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris), a mobster from Philadelphia who insists Tom is Joey Cusack, a former hitman who worked for his brother Richie Cusack (William Hurt). Tom doesn't know what he is talking about. Carl hangs around and begins to make things uncomfortable for the Stall family.""A History of Violence"", directed by David Cronenberg, and based on a graphic novel, is a very good film, maybe one of the best I have seen so far this year.The best and most convincing thing about ""History"" is the acting. Mortensen, Bello and Ashton Holmes are all great. They are entirely convincing as the members of the Stall family, living in rural Indiana, enjoying their small town life. Viggo Mortenson (the ""Lord of the Ring"" series, but I didn't really need to tell you that, did I) is great as Tom. From the opening moments, when we first meet him and his wife drives him to work, we get the picture; small town guy, pleased with his small town life. Maria Bello (""Secret Window"", ""The Cooler"") is also very good as Edie, his wife. Edie is a modern woman; she works as a lawyer during the day, but, much like her husband, her family comes first. Ashton Holmes plays their teenage son, who has the typical problems any teenager has; because he isn't the greatest athlete, he is picked on by other guys. He can handle them with words, but that only makes them more determined to beat the living cr*p out of him. The Stall's also have a young daughter, Sarah.Life is good for them until a couple of guys arrive in town. Drifting from town to town, looking for small businesses to hold up, they are psychopaths who think nothing of killing people who get in their way. The film opens with an act of violence by these two, setting the tone for the rest of their rampage. Finally, they make it to the small Indiana town and stop in Tom's diner just as he is closing. He decides to serve them, to keep them calm but things quickly escalate and Tom becomes a hero, saving his waitress and the inevitable carnage that would result from these two monsters.As soon as this happens, the media swarms his home and he becomes uncomfortable, trying to avoid the media. This same attention attracts the eye of Carl Fogarty (Harris) and his two sidekicks. They insist Tom is an old ""friend"" Joey Cusack, the man who gave Fogarty the scaring around his lame eye. Fogarty listens with deaf ears as Tom protests that he is not this Joey person, Edie doesn't listen either.But, as the film progresses, and Carl becomes more insistent, and begins to take matters into his own hands, Edie and their son, Ashton, begin to have their doubts.The violence that becomes a part of their lives also changes them, making their transformation all the more interesting.As Tom's identity becomes questioned by more and more people, he starts to take matters into his own hands. He can't have Fogarty and his men harassing or threatening his family and they won't simply go away. He has to solve the problem. Richie Cusack (William Hurt) soon tracks Tom down and Tom realizes that he won't have a moment's peace until he solves the problem with Richie. These scenes are good. But the real bread and butter of the film, what makes it so powerful, is watching the violence transform the life of the Stall family.Cronenberg does such a great job of portraying this simple family that we readily notice when they start to transform, when they start to have doubts. Tom does everything in his power to make his wife and family continue to believe in him, even as they witness him using violence to protect them, that it is almost heart wrenching to watch their loss of faith in the man they love.Even more interesting is watching the effects of violence on Edie and Jack. Each is equally amazed at all of the events that transpire around them, but they react in slightly different ways. As you watch, the action is riveting because we have already invested in these characters and want to see how the action turns out.There are two scenes between Tom and Edie which are very erotic. The first happens early on, when Tom and Edie are still Tom and Edie. They come home and have a little role playing fantasy. At first, it seems silly but Cronenberg quickly amps up the eroticism and this scene adds to their portrayal of a modern American couple. Later, another scene, equally erotic, but very different, helps to define the change in their relationship.The film opens with the psychotic drifters checking out of a small motel. Of course, we don't immediately realize they are psychotic, but this bit of information quickly becomes clear. Initially, I thought this was a prologue because one of the characters bears a striking resemblance to a young Viggo Mortensen. I think Cronenberg wants the confusion to exist as a way of linking Tom's questionable past to the current day. When the scene quickly cuts to Viggo, as Tom, walking into his home, there is still a question about how that younger guy fits into the story. Was it a flashback to Tom's life as a young man? Only when the two guys enter Tom's diner and start threatening people do we realize that they are two separate people. But the question still remains that they may be linked in other less tangible ways.""A History of Violence"" is a great film, featuring outstanding performances, an interesting story, great direction and a riveting story.

960449,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000CQLZ0Q,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 3]","Some critics say `A History of Violence' is a thought-provoking drama about the relation between violence and humans. To me, just an avid moviegoer, the film is a well-made thriller ala David Cronenberg, Canadian unique talent who once made `The Dead Zone' years ago, an exciting Stephen King adaptation. This time, he chose a modern-day noir thriller about one normal American family `the Stalls,' and showed one violent incident changes their normal life into nightmare.'A History of Violence' does not have the most realistic story, but it is still safe to say that this story is very bloody and told in a compelling fashion. `Bloody' is nothing new to Cronenberg, but his newest film begins with understated but unnerving sequence, in which two guys exchange words very quietly in front of a motel. There is something wrong about them or the motel, but the director intentionally takes a long time to show the disturbing nature of their quiet attitudes.Then the story jumps to the quiet house of Tom Stall, good ordinary father (Viggo Mortensen) of two children, and husband to his loving wife Edie Stall (Maria Bello). But when Tom has to confront two robbers carrying gun, who hit the local restraint where he works, he shows unexpected skills to deal with them. (Here, Cronenberg does not forget to show graphic violence with blood-soaked face of the criminal).This incident naturally makes Tom a kind of local hero. But it also attracts several unwanted guests including one Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris), who calls Tom `Joey' as if trying to help Tom/Joey refresh his memories.[BASED ON GRAPHIC NOVEL] Like `Road to Perdition' starring Tom Hanks, Cronenberg's `A history of Violence' is based on the graphic novel. This means the story is practically that of film noir or old Western, something you will never experience in normal life (You wandered in Nevada desert for three days?) Cronenberg is successful in telling a riveting story about how violence begets violence, but this story and its violence is not necessarily about the violence in general. But of course, this fact doesn't lessen the emotional impact that the film brings to you.Though Viggo Mortensen gives one of his best performances in his career, it is Ed Harris and William Hurt (as cameo) who are more impressive. William Hurt's quiet mannerism is creepy, eccentric, threatening and darkly funny at the same time. Remember, we are not watching the real people; we are watching distorted images of humans or their traits just like in comic book villains.[ANTI-VIOLENCE?] If asked about the theme of the film, Cronenberg would say he is against violence. I do not doubt his words, but some people would find the film's graphic violence and the film itself in a different way than his. After all it is the robbers (and truly ruthless ones as you see in the opening) who get shot by Tom. Why not call him a hero? In spite of the director's words, the violence in `A History of Violence' is open to our interpretation, and that makes the film more intriguing to the viewers though I still don't know whether or not this openness is intentional.So we should see this film as first-rate thriller or modernized Western.

960450,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B000CQLZ0Q,Turfseer,"[1, 3]","***Warning: this review may contain spoilers ***At the beginning of 'History of Violence', we meet two vicious killers who murder three people in a motel including a young child. Director Cronenberg immediately cuts to his protagonists, the Stall family, so I thought this was going to end up as another 'Desperate Hours', home invasion type of flick, with the bad guys invading the family home and perhaps terrorizing them or taking somebody hostage. Refreshingly, for a few moments at least, Cronenberg goes in another direction. The bad guys are dispatched by the principal protagonist, Tom Stall, played by Viggo Mortensen. It turns out that Stall has tried to erase his past life as Joey Cusack, a Mafia hoodlum, and has assumed a new identity in an idyllic Indiana town. But at the critical moment, while working at his place of business, a family diner, he's able to use his past skills as a made man and blows away the killers. As a result, he becomes an instant celebrity and becomes the subject of media scrutiny.Unfortunately, beyond this point, not a lot makes sense in this film. For starters, Cronenberg admits that the media scrutiny is only a local phenomena. The truth of the matter is that such a story would not remain a local event but would be covered nationally as well as on the internet. After Mafia boss Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris) shows up on the scene, folksy Sheriff Sam Carney does some 'research' to try and find out whether Fogarty is telling the truth that Tom has been leading a double life. For some reason, he's only able to find out about Mafia boss 'Ritchie'--there's no mention of Joey anywhere. Now why is that? A Google search would have certainly brought up information on the brother of a well known mobster such as Joey who police are aware ripped Fogarty's eye out. Furthermore, once the media found out about Tom the hero, there would have been intense scrutiny about his background leading to the discovery that Tom is not who he says he is.Now what about the ridiculous scene where Tom ends up seeing Fogarty's car and assumes it's heading out of town to his house to do harm to his family? Why does he start running all the way home? If he believed that the mobsters were going to hurt his family, wouldn't he have 1) called Sheriff Sam immediately and 2) grabbed a car or got one of his employees or friends to drive him home right away? Why do the mobsters attempt to induce Tom to come with them? He's standing right out on the lawn when Fogarty or one of his two henchmen could have went right up to him and shot him in the head? For that matter, if they wanted to, they could have killed the whole family right then and there.What exactly happened to Fogarty and his henchmen after Tom and Jack blow them away? We never see the police arrive and the bodies being taken away. Wouldn't there have been even more media interest which certainly would have led to the discovery that Tom was connected to the mobsters in the past? All we see is the Sheriff come over and make some meek inquiries as to Tom's background.While we find out next to nothing about Ed Harris's Fogarty, the same goes for brother Ritchie. They are both stereotypes of the typical Mafiosi. Cronenberg resorts to making Ritchie into a buffoon and admits that he didn't use a soundtrack during the climactic scene where Tom dispatches his brother and his minions in order to play up the comedy. Another stereotype is the school bully who is constantly harassing son Jack. How many times have we seen this type of character in poorly written films? Even worse, the bullying isn't even convincing (would a bully pick a fight just because a guy catches a baseball and the game is over?) In order to 'humanize' his principals, Tom and Edie, Cronenberg pads his film with overlong sex scenes. Worse is his obsession with showing all the blood and guts that are spilled whenever someone is shot. There's even an absurd 'DVD extra' which shows contrasting American and International versions of a scene focusing on the amount of blood that spurts out of a victim's mouth.While technically Cronenberg is a highly competent director who is able to get decent performances out of his actors, the script he's working with is amateurish. Ironically, History of Violence has little 'history' in it at all. Instead, it's a sordid tale of redemption in which a reformed man must defend himself against one-dimensional straw men who we neither care or know next to nothing about.",2,Cheap Mafia stereotypes abound in this sordid tale of redemption,1261180800,"12 19, 2009",2009,4480,"['***Warning', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***At', 'beginning', ""'History"", 'Violence', 'meet', 'two', 'vicious', 'killers', 'who', 'murder', 'three', 'people', 'motel', 'including', 'young', 'child', 'Director', 'Cronenberg', 'immediately', 'protagonists', 'Stall', 'family', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'up', ""'Desperate"", 'Hours', 'home', 'invasion', 'type', 'flick', 'bad', 'guys', 'invading', 'family', 'home', 'perhaps', 'terrorizing', 'taking', 'somebody', 'hostage', 'Refreshingly', 'few', 'moments', 'least', 'Cronenberg', 'direction', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'dispatched', 'principal', 'protagonist', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'played', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'out', 'Stall', 'tried', 'erase', 'past', 'life', 'Joey', 'Cusack', 'Mafia', 'hoodlum', 'assumed', 'new', 'identity', 'idyllic', 'Indiana', 'town', 'critical', 'moment', 'working', 'place', 'business', 'family', 'diner', 'able', 'use', 'past', 'skills', 'made', 'man', 'away', 'killers', 'result', 'instant', 'celebrity', 'subject', 'media', 'scrutiny.Unfortunately', 'point', 'not', 'lot', 'sense', 'film', 'starters', 'Cronenberg', 'media', 'scrutiny', 'only', 'local', 'phenomena', 'truth', 'matter', 'story', 'would', 'not', 'remain', 'local', 'event', 'would', 'be', 'covered', 'nationally', 'as', 'well', 'internet', 'Mafia', 'boss', 'Carl', 'Fogarty', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'up', 'scene', 'folksy', 'Sheriff', 'Sam', 'Carney', ""'research"", 'try', 'find', 'out', 'Fogarty', 'telling', 'truth', 'Tom', 'been', 'leading', 'double', 'life', 'reason', 'only', 'able', 'find', 'out', 'Mafia', 'boss', ""'Ritchie"", 'mention', 'Joey', 'anywhere', 'Now', 'why', 'Google', 'search', 'would', 'have', 'certainly', 'brought', 'up', 'information', 'brother', 'well', 'known', 'mobster', 'such', 'Joey', 'who', 'police', 'are', 'aware', 'ripped', 'Fogarty', 'eye', 'out', 'Furthermore', 'once', 'media', 'found', 'out', 'Tom', 'hero', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'intense', 'scrutiny', 'background', 'leading', 'discovery', 'Tom', 'not', 'who', 'is.Now', 'what', 'ridiculous', 'scene', 'where', 'Tom', 'up', 'seeing', 'Fogarty', 'car', 'heading', 'town', 'house', 'do', 'harm', 'family', 'Why', 'start', 'running', 'way', 'home', 'believed', 'mobsters', 'were', 'going', 'hurt', 'family', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', '1', 'called', 'Sheriff', 'Sam', 'immediately', '2', 'grabbed', 'car', 'got', 'one', 'employees', 'friends', 'drive', 'home', 'right', 'away', 'Why', 'do', 'mobsters', 'attempt', 'induce', 'Tom', 'come', 'standing', 'right', 'out', 'lawn', 'when', 'Fogarty', 'one', 'two', 'henchmen', 'could', 'have', 'went', 'right', 'up', 'shot', 'head', 'matter', 'wanted', 'could', 'have', 'killed', 'whole', 'family', 'right', 'then', 'there.What', 'exactly', 'happened', 'Fogarty', 'henchmen', 'Tom', 'Jack', 'blow', 'away', 'never', 'see', 'police', 'arrive', 'bodies', 'being', 'taken', 'away', 'Would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'even', 'more', 'media', 'interest', 'certainly', 'would', 'have', 'led', 'discovery', 'Tom', 'was', 'connected', 'mobsters', 'past', 'see', 'Sheriff', 'come', 'make', 'meek', 'inquiries', 'Tom', 'background.While', 'find', 'out', 'next', 'nothing', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Fogarty', 'same', 'brother', 'Ritchie', 'are', 'stereotypes', 'typical', 'Mafiosi', 'Cronenberg', 'making', 'Ritchie', 'buffoon', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'soundtrack', 'climactic', 'scene', 'where', 'Tom', 'brother', 'minions', 'order', 'play', 'up', 'comedy', 'stereotype', 'school', 'bully', 'who', 'constantly', 'harassing', 'son', 'Jack', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'seen', 'type', 'character', 'poorly', 'written', 'films', 'Even', 'worse', 'bullying', ""n't"", 'even', 'convincing', 'would', 'bully', 'fight', 'just', 'guy', 'baseball', 'game', 'order', ""'humanize"", 'principals', 'Tom', 'Edie', 'Cronenberg', 'film', 'overlong', 'sex', 'scenes', 'Worse', 'obsession', 'showing', 'blood', 'guts', 'are', 'spilled', 'whenever', 'someone', 'shot', 'even', 'absurd', ""'DVD"", 'extra', 'contrasting', 'American', 'International', 'versions', 'scene', 'focusing', 'amount', 'blood', 'victim', 'mouth.While', 'technically', 'Cronenberg', 'highly', 'competent', 'director', 'who', 'able', 'get', 'decent', 'performances', 'actors', 'script', 'working', 'amateurish', 'Ironically', 'History', 'Violence', 'little', ""'history"", 'Instead', 'sordid', 'tale', 'redemption', 'reformed', 'man', 'must', 'defend', 'one-dimensional', 'straw', 'men', 'who', 'care', 'know', 'next', 'nothing', 'about']",N/A

960455,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B000CQLZ0Q,Wheelchair Assassin,"[0, 1]","At the risk of damning A History of Violence with faint praise, in a decidedly mixed year for movies it easily managed to stand out as one of the best.  Directed by David Cronenberg, it's a weird mix of psychological thriller, family drama, and action-oriented guy movie, concerning itself more with the implications of violence than with violence itself.  The movie's title ends up taking on more meaning than you might think, as it becomes clear that a history of violence can quickly become one's present as well.  Its shambolic, irregular pace and laconic dialogue only partly belie the internal and interpersonal conflicts roiling just beneath its surface.In this case, the history of violence belongs to one Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen), a friendly family man who shows a special aptitude for killing when two vicious murderers enter his Indiana diner and leave in body bags.  It's not long before a twisted, disfigured gangster named Carl Fogarty shows up at the diner with two lackeys in tow, calling Tom Joey and implying that they have some unfinished business to attend to.  Although the movie doesn't play its hand too early, it soon becomes evident that Tom isn't quite who his wife and kids think he is.  It turns out that in a past life, Tom was an Irish mobster from Philadelphia by the name of Joey Cusack, and his violent tendencies were too much for even his fellow gangsters to handle (when you hear what happened to Fogarty's face, you'll know precisely what I mean).  It's evident that Tom didn't outrun his past as thoroughly as he thought he had, and he's going to have to literally and figuratively confront some demons back in Philly if he's going to have even the slightest hope of recapturing his idyllic Midwestern existence.Tom/Joey isn't an easy role for Mortensen to play, as he has to be convincing as a mild-mannered family man, while at the same time being menacing enough for the audience to believe he was once a brutal killer and could become one again, but Mortenson's understated performance captures the character about as well as anyone could.  Ed Harris, as usual, is great as Fogarty, who barely conceals his anger beneath a detached demeanor and the sunglasses that cover his mangled eye, but clearly harbors a deep conviction that Joey's new life isn't going to allow him to avoid paying the price for his prior bad acts.  And in a role that could've brought little to the table, Maria Bello exemplifies the movie's deep emotional divisions as the wife whose loyalty steadily gives way to fear and anger as she realizes she might not have married such a nice guy after all.  Since it's so central to the plot, the violence itself is also noteworthy, as it's much more brutal than what you'd expect from a Hollywood movie.  Granted, there aren't rivers of blood as in Sin City or Kill Bill Vol. 1, but the violence takes on a more unsettling quality here because it's so jarring, blunt, and unstylized.  When Tom shoots a guy through the back of the head, and later smashes another guy's nose to pieces, there's a lifelike quality to it that makes it much more effective than the standard action fare.The movie ends on a suitably ambiguous note, and along the way it raises some difficult questions about identity and self-perception-if a killer changes his name and life, does he stop being a killer?-and examines how the past can intrude on the present in the most figuratively and literally violent of manners.  Ultimately, A History of Violence is about what happens when two worlds collide, when Bad Men come to a Nice Town and find an even badder man waiting for them.  Even more than that, though, it's about what happens when two sides of a single man clash, and it's no longer clear who he really is, or whether he every really ""was"" anybody to begin with.  A History of Violence is longer on questions than on answers, but I for one wouldn't have it any other way.",4,It's good,1144281600,"04 6, 2006",2006,3918,"['risk', 'damning', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'faint', 'praise', 'decidedly', 'mixed', 'year', 'movies', 'easily', 'managed', 'stand', 'out', 'one', 'best', 'Directed', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'weird', 'mix', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'family', 'drama', 'action-oriented', 'guy', 'movie', 'concerning', 'more', 'implications', 'violence', 'violence', 'movie', 'title', 'up', 'taking', 'more', 'meaning', 'might', 'think', 'clear', 'history', 'violence', 'can', 'quickly', 'become', 'one', 'present', 'as', 'well', 'shambolic', 'irregular', 'pace', 'laconic', 'dialogue', 'only', 'partly', 'internal', 'interpersonal', 'conflicts', 'roiling', 'just', 'beneath', 'surface.In', 'case', 'history', 'violence', 'belongs', 'one', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'friendly', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'special', 'aptitude', 'killing', 'when', 'two', 'vicious', 'murderers', 'enter', 'Indiana', 'diner', 'leave', 'body', 'bags', 'not', 'long', 'twisted', 'disfigured', 'gangster', 'named', 'Carl', 'Fogarty', 'up', 'diner', 'two', 'lackeys', 'tow', 'calling', 'Tom', 'Joey', 'implying', 'have', 'unfinished', 'business', 'attend', 'movie', ""n't"", 'play', 'hand', 'too', 'early', 'soon', 'evident', 'Tom', ""n't"", 'quite', 'who', 'wife', 'kids', 'think', 'out', 'past', 'life', 'Tom', 'was', 'Irish', 'mobster', 'Philadelphia', 'name', 'Joey', 'Cusack', 'violent', 'tendencies', 'were', 'too', 'much', 'even', 'fellow', 'gangsters', 'handle', 'when', 'hear', 'what', 'happened', 'Fogarty', 'face', ""'ll"", 'know', 'precisely', 'what', 'mean', 'evident', 'Tom', 'did', ""n't"", 'outrun', 'past', 'as', 'thoroughly', 'thought', 'had', 'going', 'have', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'confront', 'demons', 'back', 'Philly', 'going', 'have', 'even', 'slightest', 'hope', 'recapturing', 'idyllic', 'Midwestern', 'existence.Tom/Joey', ""n't"", 'easy', 'role', 'Mortensen', 'play', 'be', 'convincing', 'mild-mannered', 'family', 'man', 'same', 'time', 'being', 'menacing', 'enough', 'audience', 'believe', 'was', 'once', 'brutal', 'killer', 'could', 'become', 'one', 'again', 'Mortenson', 'understated', 'performance', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'anyone', 'could', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'usual', 'great', 'Fogarty', 'who', 'barely', 'anger', 'beneath', 'detached', 'demeanor', 'sunglasses', 'cover', 'mangled', 'eye', 'clearly', 'harbors', 'deep', 'conviction', 'Joey', 'new', 'life', ""n't"", 'going', 'allow', 'avoid', 'paying', 'price', 'prior', 'bad', 'acts', 'role', 'could', ""'ve"", 'brought', 'little', 'table', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'movie', 'deep', 'emotional', 'divisions', 'wife', 'loyalty', 'steadily', 'way', 'fear', 'anger', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'married', 'nice', 'guy', 'so', 'central', 'plot', 'violence', 'also', 'noteworthy', 'much', 'more', 'brutal', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'Granted', 'are', ""n't"", 'rivers', 'blood', 'Sin', 'City', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'Vol', '1', 'violence', 'more', 'unsettling', 'quality', 'here', 'so', 'jarring', 'blunt', 'unstylized', 'When', 'Tom', 'guy', 'back', 'head', 'later', 'smashes', 'guy', 'nose', 'pieces', 'lifelike', 'quality', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'standard', 'action', 'fare.The', 'movie', 'suitably', 'ambiguous', 'note', 'way', 'difficult', 'questions', 'identity', 'self-perception-if', 'killer', 'name', 'life', 'stop', 'being', 'killer', '-and', 'how', 'past', 'can', 'intrude', 'present', 'most', 'figuratively', 'literally', 'violent', 'manners', 'Ultimately', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'what', 'when', 'two', 'worlds', 'collide', 'when', 'Bad', 'Men', 'come', 'Nice', 'Town', 'find', 'even', 'badder', 'man', 'waiting', 'Even', 'more', 'though', 'what', 'when', 'two', 'sides', 'single', 'man', 'clash', 'no', 'longer', 'clear', 'who', 'really', 'really', 'was', 'anybody', 'begin', 'History', 'Violence', 'longer', 'questions', 'answers', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'other', 'way']",N/A

It's amazing to chart his progress from that early work to this subtle and complex movie.  The story surprised me (the expected climax came about an hour in, and everything after that was new territory) and it got me thinking about how an act of violence can change a family.  In that respect it has some parallels to Road to Perdition, although that is a superior movie.  Still, I was impressed by many of the acting performances in History, especially from Maria Bello, the great Ed Harris, and the young guy who played the teenage son.  It stops short of being a ""masterpiece"" -- the plot was a bit too chopped-up for that, and it fell into a lull at odd times -- but it was still an entertaining and worthwhile movie-going experience.",4,Several strong performances,1128124800,"10 1, 2005",2005,900,"['someone', 'who', 'followed', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'career', 'Scanners', 'new', 'film', 'latest', 'step', 'evolution', 'mature', 'skilled', 'filmmaker', 'amazing', 'chart', 'progress', 'early', 'work', 'subtle', 'complex', 'movie', 'story', 'surprised', 'expected', 'climax', 'came', 'hour', 'everything', 'was', 'new', 'territory', 'got', 'thinking', 'how', 'act', 'violence', 'can', 'change', 'family', 'respect', 'parallels', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'superior', 'movie', 'Still', 'was', 'impressed', 'many', 'acting', 'performances', 'History', 'especially', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'great', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'young', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'teenage', 'son', 'short', 'being', 'masterpiece', 'plot', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'chopped-up', 'fell', 'lull', 'odd', 'times', 'was', 'still', 'entertaining', 'worthwhile', 'movie-going', 'experience']",N/A
960458,ARFCORBCTKX1J,B000CQLZ0Q,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[1, 4]","I watched these films one right after the other (""Promises"", first). As they're thematically almost identical, and have the same male lead, it made sense to write a single review covering both.In ""History"", I'm not giving away any great secret when I reveal that Tom Stall really is a gangster trying to escape his past and lead a decent life. He's ""outed"" when obliged to kill the men robbing his diner, and the TV stories of his heroism come to the attention of those he thought would never be able to locate him. The rest of the film is basically a revenge tale in which Stall is obliged to kill every last one of them, including his brother (an almost-unrecognizable William Hurt, in a performance that sidesteps most of the ""standard-gangster"" clich&eacute;s).The problem is that there's not much else to the story. It's little more than a revenge tale that has no moral force, because Stall truly needs to protect himself and his family. There is no drama without choice. (Roger Ebert's argument that had Joey /truly/ become Tom, he would have died in the diner robbery, is absurd. Tom throws hot coffee at one of the robbers, which /any/ desperate person would have done if they were worried about the lives of those around them. Tom is virtually certain that the younger of the robbers /will/ kill one of his employees, even before he hands over the cash register's contents. This renders pointless any ambiguity about ""who"" Tom really is -- if you know you're going to die, you'll take any chance.)Despite Cronenberg's averral that he wants the audience to identify with Stall's killings (rather than be revulsed by them), so that we have to consider their morality, the /fact/ is that Stall's need to violently defend himself is at least /legally/ justifiable, and the audience is completely on the side of a genuinely reformed gangster from the start. I greatly enjoyed the vicarious pleasure of seeing him off every one of his enemies, and most viewers are likely to cheer rather than turn away.Another problem with ""History"" is the way Stall's wife is so quick to reject him when she learns the truth. We see, in an early sex scene, how much they genuinely care for each other, but even Tom's post-revelation rape (yes), which she thoroughly enjoys, is not enough to bring her to her senses. If Cronenberg is making the trite observation that we never /really/ know the people we live with, it would have been more effective if Stall's wife, though understandably frightened and anguished, were also at least /somewhat/ ambivalent about the situation. How can a woman who says ""You're the best man I've ever known"" be so quick to think the man she's spent almost 20 years with is a monster in disguise? But, no, she firmly rejects him until the final scene (which Cronenberg directs with beautiful restraint). I would have kicked her out and found a more-loyal mate.There's no restraint in Cronenberg's continuing love for explicit gore. In both films people are brutally killed, and Cronenberg doesn't hesitate to show us -- in close-up -- such things as a slit throat pumping blood, or the nearly blown-off jaw of a still-living person. (If you think this is bad, take a look at the deleted scenes from ""The Fly"", some of which would likely have gotten that film an X rating.)If ""A History of Violence"" is about character, rather than plot (as Roger Ebert suggests it is), you coulda fooled /me/. Its ending is largely determined by its beginning, and that is not the substance of character-driven stories. There is one genuinely clever and witty scene in which Stall's son, Jack, verbally humiliates the school bully. But Jack is later obliged to beat up the guy, and Stall is worried about being sued by the kid's parents (!!!).""Eastern Promises"" is about Russian gangsters in London. It, too, is a revenge story, but one of more complexity and subtlety. It has an audience-pleasing twist ending that is at least plausible, if not wholly likely.Morton Vigoro -- I mean, Viggo Mortensen -- is a Russian criminal (Nikolai) who's the ""driver"" for a Russian gangster (Semyon -- Armand Mueller-Stahl) who runs a fine restaurant. Nikolai's tattoos reveal his criminal life; without these tattoos, he wouldn't be trusted, or for that matter, even be considered a criminal at all. When Semyon has had enough of his feckless son Kirill (Vincent Cassell), he agrees to have the kid offed, with Nikolai moving into Kirill's position -- which is what Nikolai has wanted all along. More I cannot say -- other than to be patient with the first few minutes of the film, which at first seem incomprehensible.Unlike ""History"", ""Promises"" /is/ about character, and we're not sure how we're supposed to take Nikolai -- he seems to be a villain with just the faintest trace of a conscience. Kirill is particularly interesting, as his homophobia clearly covers his own sexual confusion. He's obviously in love with Nikolai. Nikolai's feelings about Kirill are not so clear. Is he just using Kirill -- or is he also attracted to him?""Eastern Promises"" is a legitimate drama, and if you can get past Cronenberg's horrifying neck slashings, you'll probably enjoy it.",2,DON'T
