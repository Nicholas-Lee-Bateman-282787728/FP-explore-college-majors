Broke a sweat but was able to modify the exercises based on my energy level/abilities.  Looking forward to using this video for a while!Update 2 years later...I let myself get out of shape since my initial review, then 8 mo ago got back into the exercise groove. I started by using this DVD in addition to some Jillian Michael and Jackie Warner workouts and within 6 months I was, to be blunt, kicking booty. By rotating workouts using DVDs like this one, and changing my eating habits, I've shed over 40 lbs and am getting into great shape.  **IF** you are able to do lunges (good knees) and situps (good back), then this workout is AWESOME. You get what you put into this, and by listening to the instructor's advice (""SQUEEZE!"") and pushing yourself, you too can lose your fear of lunges! Not to mention gain some very nice butt muscle...  My goal back in Jan was to be able to do this entire DVD using perfect form. Now that I've happily met that goal, I've rotated different workouts into my repertoire but still use this one occasionally.A few more notes... this workout can be ""adjusted"" to use minimal space and it requires NO equipment, so it's a great travel workout. I love the instructor, Teri Ann Krefting...so much so that I bought another workout she was in just because of her (hated the DVD, unfortunately, but that's not her fault, she was just doing it, not leading it).

There aren't any ultra dancy moves so if you aren't co-ordinated you'll get this down.  All the moves (aerobic and toning) are done with a base move that you can stay with or move with the transitions into more intense moves.

I don't want a fitness video that is shot outside, or on a set that looks like a living room. I like when there are a number of people behind the instructor, so it is like a class. Having just the instructor talking to the camera is too much like a trainer, which is a concept I find really offensive. I am not a puppy! Crunch videos provide fairly rigorous workouts that are not too repetitive, in a class format, with instructors that are not too cheery or robotic. This video goes through aerobics and toning moves for the lower body, the pace is good, and the choreography is interesting. The whistle around the instructor's neck at the beginning of the video is the only part that is like a bootcamp, so if you are looking for that style of workout, this is not it. The big problem with this, and all the Crunch videos is that they are not long enough. I work out for 60-90 minutes. Most of the Crunch videos are 30-40 minute.

I worked up a sweat and actually enjoyed the work out a lot.As somone else mentioned, there was a lot of hootin' and hollerin', but I didn't feel like that detracted from the work out. The parts where she tried to act like a boot camp trainer were a little silly, but overall I thought the instructor was good. She was motivating without being annoying.I personally didn't feel like the ab sections were all that great; I didn't find them very challenging. But I thought the cardio aspects outweighed the less than great ab portions, so overall I really enjoyed this video.

1084999,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B000S1MM8E,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[1, 1]","When you think of ""Bootcamp"" you probably imagine you are going to get yelled at. This workout is however much more playful. The exercises definitely work you out but there are different levels so you can feel comfortable. Whether you want to push your limits or just casually exercise there is something for everyone. Most of the high impact moves are optional and I avoided them. I still felt I got a good workout even when I modified some of the moves. I felt this workout mostly in my thighs and abs. This is over forty minutes but it felt like ten. That is how quickly it went.~The Rebecca Review",4,Playful,1390435200,"01 23, 2014",2014,601,"['When', 'think', 'Bootcamp', 'probably', 'imagine', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'yelled', 'workout', 'however', 'much', 'more', 'playful', 'exercises', 'definitely', 'work', 'out', 'are', 'different', 'levels', 'can', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'want', 'push', 'limits', 'just', 'casually', 'exercise', 'something', 'everyone', 'Most', 'high', 'impact', 'moves', 'are', 'optional', 'avoided', 'still', 'felt', 'got', 'good', 'workout', 'even', 'when', 'modified', 'moves', 'felt', 'workout', 'mostly', 'thighs', 'abs', 'forty', 'minutes', 'felt', 'like', 'ten', 'how', 'quickly', 'Rebecca', 'Review']","Crunch: Belly,butt,thghs Btcmp"
1085000,ADLN37B0153N,B000S1MM8E,Silmarwen,"[1, 1]","This is a fast-paced, relatively fun cardio and toning workout for beginner & intermediate exercisers.  It is 41 minutes long so it is pretty easy to squeeze into your schedule.  The instructor gives good cues and it is easy to follow her instructions.  The moves are not challenging in that they are easy to follow, but they really get your heart rate pumping.  It was also nice to see several different body types doing the workout and they have one exerciser doing the beginner options for moves that are more advanced.  I liked this DVD because I felt that slight soreness in my muscles the next day that let me know that I worked out, which I really like.  I found that I mainly felt this workout in my butt, then my thighs and lastly my abs.  I also liked the instructor.  She gave good cues and was upbeat and encouraging without being obnoxious.  The music is the fairly typical techno, forgettable soundtrack and did not really add to the workout or detract from it in any way.The DVD starts with a warm up section that is short - mainly marching, step touching and a few stretches.  Next phase is a cardio burst, which is 4 different moves that are linked together.  They are referred to as ""stages"" in that you can pick the stage that is best for you.  You can do all 4 of them or you can still with stage 1 or stage 2 for a lower impact, easier workout.  The higher stages typically involve jumping and/or knee lifts or something like that so they can really amp up your heart rate in no time.  Then you switch to a toning section.  The toning sections are mainly lunges, squats and other fairly normal exercises.  The nice part is that you work your abs in every section, but most of the abs sections are standing with upright crunches or other variations.  There are a total of 3 cardio bursts & 3 toning sections, ending on the floor with mat work for your abs.  Then there is a cool down and stretch section at the end.My main complaint with the workout is the very short transition between the cardio bursts & toning sections.  I am not in very good shape right now, but I could keep up with all 4 stages of the cardio burst.  However, if I did all 4, then my heart rate was up in the higher section of my target heart rate range and I felt like I needed more time to bring it down before I stopped to do the toning sections.  I just paused the DVD and did some marching in place and then was able to resume.  The only part that I really disliked in the workout was the cooldown stretching section.  I am very inflexible and it was not enough stretching for me and I could not do many of the stretches the way that they were shown on the DVD.  I did my own stretches at the end while the credits were running and that seemed to do the trick.",4,Good Workout for Beginner & Intermediate Exercisers,1239321600,"04 10, 2009",2009,2758,"['fast-paced', 'relatively', 'fun', 'cardio', 'toning', 'workout', 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'exercisers', '41', 'minutes', 'long', 'pretty', 'easy', 'squeeze', 'schedule', 'instructor', 'good', 'cues', 'easy', 'follow', 'instructions', 'moves', 'are', 'not', 'challenging', 'are', 'easy', 'follow', 'really', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'pumping', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'several', 'different', 'body', 'types', 'doing', 'workout', 'have', 'one', 'exerciser', 'doing', 'beginner', 'options', 'moves', 'are', 'more', 'advanced', 'liked', 'DVD', 'felt', 'slight', 'soreness', 'muscles', 'next', 'day', 'let', 'know', 'worked', 'out', 'really', 'found', 'mainly', 'felt', 'workout', 'butt', 'then', 'thighs', 'lastly', 'abs', 'also', 'liked', 'instructor', 'gave', 'good', 'cues', 'was', 'upbeat', 'encouraging', 'being', 'obnoxious', 'music', 'fairly', 'typical', 'techno', 'forgettable', 'soundtrack', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'add', 'workout', 'detract', 'way.The', 'DVD', 'warm', 'up', 'section', 'short', 'mainly', 'marching', 'step', 'touching', 'few', 'stretches', 'Next', 'phase', 'cardio', 'burst', '4', 'different', 'moves', 'are', 'linked', 'together', 'are', 'referred', 'stages', 'can', 'pick', 'stage', 'best', 'can', 'do', '4', 'can', 'still', 'stage', '1', 'stage', '2', 'lower', 'impact', 'easier', 'workout', 'higher', 'stages', 'typically', 'involve', 'jumping', 'and/or', 'knee', 'lifts', 'something', 'can', 'really', 'amp', 'up', 'heart', 'rate', 'time', 'Then', 'switch', 'toning', 'section', 'toning', 'sections', 'are', 'mainly', 'lunges', 'squats', 'other', 'fairly', 'normal', 'exercises', 'nice', 'part', 'work', 'abs', 'section', 'most', 'abs', 'sections', 'are', 'standing', 'upright', 'crunches', 'other', 'variations', 'are', 'total', '3', 'cardio', 'bursts', '3', 'toning', 'sections', 'ending', 'floor', 'mat', 'work', 'abs', 'Then', 'cool', 'down', 'stretch', 'section', 'end.My', 'main', 'complaint', 'workout', 'very', 'short', 'transition', 'cardio', 'toning', 'sections', 'am', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'shape', 'right', 'now', 'could', 'keep', 'up', '4', 'stages', 'cardio', 'burst', 'However', 'did', '4', 'then', 'heart', 'rate', 'was', 'up', 'higher', 'section', 'target', 'heart', 'rate', 'range', 'felt', 'needed', 'more', 'time', 'bring', 'down', 'stopped', 'do', 'toning', 'sections', 'just', 'paused', 'DVD', 'did', 'marching', 'place', 'then', 'was', 'able', 'resume', 'only', 'part', 'really', 'disliked', 'workout', 'was', 'cooldown', 'stretching', 'section', 'am', 'very', 'inflexible', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'stretching', 'could', 'not', 'do', 'many', 'stretches', 'way', 'were', 'shown', 'DVD', 'did', 'own', 'stretches', 'end', 'credits', 'were', 'running', 'seemed', 'do', 'trick']","Crunch: Belly,butt,thghs Btcmp"
