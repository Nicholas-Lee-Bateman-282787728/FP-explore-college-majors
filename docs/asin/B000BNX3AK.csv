945639,A3PLN4YGJ58NX0,B000BNX3AK,"Robert A. Bowers ""Bowers""","[3, 3]","Let me tell you what I liked about this movie first of all:  1st,  it has a bilingual soundtrack and options for subtitles in English if you choose the Spanish language track.  2nd, it has some good voice actors and animation  better than many cartoons I have seen. 3rd, it is about the only kid's movie to address the Jan. 5th holiday I know of, which really is a BIG deal in other parts of the world, and in more places in the USA than you might imagine!  I think it's a wonderful tradition and should be encouraged.  The downside? 1st, this movie  certainly doesn't maintain the Biblical story,(who knew the Wise Men got so much help from a hunky soldier and warrior babe?) 2nd, another viewer was correct; Jesus is often lost in the action of the story; most of the plot has to do with getting magical gifts to take to Jesus.  3rd,  and most importantly,  it substitutes magic and monsters for the very real dangers the Magi probably had to overcome; it's a shame the makers of this film didn't trust the power of the story they had all along. My recommendation?  Watch it with your kids and discuss it with them, both for it's fun points and to make sure they understand the story it is based on (not just the dragon and evil wizard).",2,"Nice to finally get a movie for 3 Kings, but wish it was better",1294185600,"01 5, 2011",2011,1239,"['Let', 'tell', 'what', 'liked', 'movie', 'first', '1st', 'bilingual', 'soundtrack', 'options', 'subtitles', 'English', 'choose', 'Spanish', 'language', 'track', '2nd', 'good', 'voice', 'actors', 'animation', 'better', 'many', 'cartoons', 'have', 'seen', '3rd', 'only', 'kid', 'movie', 'address', 'Jan.', '5th', 'holiday', 'know', 'really', 'BIG', 'deal', 'other', 'parts', 'world', 'more', 'places', 'USA', 'might', 'imagine', 'think', 'wonderful', 'tradition', 'should', 'be', 'encouraged', 'downside', '1st', 'movie', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'maintain', 'Biblical', 'story', 'who', 'knew', 'Wise', 'Men', 'got', 'so', 'much', 'help', 'hunky', 'soldier', 'warrior', 'babe', '2nd', 'viewer', 'was', 'correct', 'Jesus', 'often', 'lost', 'action', 'story', 'most', 'plot', 'do', 'getting', 'magical', 'gifts', 'take', 'Jesus', '3rd', 'most', 'importantly', 'magic', 'monsters', 'very', 'real', 'dangers', 'Magi', 'probably', 'had', 'overcome', 'shame', 'makers', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'trust', 'power', 'story', 'had', 'along', 'recommendation', 'Watch', 'kids', 'discuss', 'fun', 'points', 'make', 'sure', 'understand', 'story', 'based', 'not', 'just', 'dragon', 'evil', 'wizard']",The 3 Wise Men
945640,A3ICVJQMZAGQV5,B000BNX3AK,wisdomstar,"[11, 11]","How bad can an animated movie be? Let me count the ways. First of all, the best art work in the movie is on the cover of the box. It's all downhill inside. Secondly, the story is a hash of magicians, wolves, dragon, scorpion, slaves, etc., and 'let's all be friends and play nice' morality. Whoever produced, directed, and wrote this mess needs to 'examine their priorities', as Ron Weasley would tell them. Baby Jesus turns out to be a bright light, the angel is a poor rip-off of the genie from Aladdin, David's slingshot kills the dragon (oops! spoiler! but you aren't really going to watch this, are you?) and Herod (who probably was a monster in his own right with no help from sorcery whatsoever)is a spoiled brat. Do not e-mail me for a free copy. For the first time I have thrown away a movie that I paid full price for. I think it might actually be bad for children to watch so I won't pass it on.",1,a waste of money and time,1196121600,"11 27, 2007",2007,906,"['How', 'bad', 'can', 'animated', 'movie', 'be', 'Let', 'count', 'ways', 'First', 'all', 'best', 'art', 'work', 'movie', 'cover', 'box', 'downhill', 'inside', 'Secondly', 'story', 'hash', 'magicians', 'wolves', 'dragon', 'scorpion', 'slaves', 'etc.', 'be', 'friends', 'play', 'nice', 'morality', 'Whoever', 'produced', 'directed', 'wrote', 'mess', ""'examine"", 'priorities', 'Ron', 'Weasley', 'would', 'tell', 'Baby', 'Jesus', 'out', 'be', 'bright', 'light', 'angel', 'poor', 'rip-off', 'genie', 'Aladdin', 'David', 'slingshot', 'dragon', 'oops', 'spoiler', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'going', 'watch', 'are', 'Herod', 'who', 'probably', 'was', 'monster', 'own', 'right', 'help', 'sorcery', 'whatsoever', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'Do', 'not', 'e-mail', 'free', 'copy', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'thrown', 'away', 'movie', 'paid', 'full', 'price', 'think', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'bad', 'children', 'watch', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'pass']",The 3 Wise Men
