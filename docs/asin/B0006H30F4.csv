867696,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B0006H30F4,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[0, 0]","This 2003 film, Seducing Dr. Lewis,  is a fun and quirky French film about a small Canadian village of about 120 people in St.-Marie-La-Mauderne where fishing isn't good, and the folks line up to receive their welfare checks where the money lasts 2 weeks and the shame lasts a month.A company wants to build a factory here, and a requirement is the town must have 200 people and a doctor, which they don't have either.  So, in order to lure a doctor with a committment to sign and stay on, the townspeople band together to play along with the deceptive schemes, including tapping his phone to find out as much as possible.  The doctor arrives to discover some oddball things going on.  One deception is that the town has a cricket team; and they know absolutely nothing about cricket, but it is hilarious as they attempt to construct a game in view of the arriving doctor.  Since the fishing is poor, they place frozen fish in the sea so the doctor can catch something.This is a fun and a feel-good comedy, it is not stupid, but clever writing, crazy plot, memorable characters and overall a quirky storyline.  There are beautiful views of the sea, the sky and the quaint village itself.  This is a clean movie with no offensive language, nor situations.  Director Jean-Francois Pouliot has been a successful director of film and television commercials.

Walter ""awalter""","[0, 0]","""Seducing Doctor Lewis"" (or ""La grande seduction"") is the story of a remote Canadian community, an old fishing town, hoping to seduce a big-city doctor to move there so that a factory will open and take the town's population of 125 people off of public welfare.  Following the precedent of ""Doc Hollywood"" and ""Northern Exposure,"" the film highlights the attractive simplicity of small town life and makes it almost as irresistible to the audience as it supposed to be to Doctor Lewis.  The film has a couple small, but glaring, conceptual similarities to its predecessors: 1) as in ""Doc Hollywood,"" the doctor is a plastic surgeon--i.e. just the sort of person who needs an adorable small town to straighten out his priorities, and 2) as in ""Northern Exposure"" the doctor is looking at a limited, 5-year stint in the town, something that seems more plausible than seeing a young doctor dedicating his entire future career to a town of just over 100 people.  All in all, ""Seducing Doctor Lewis"" is the seductive little film it sets out to be, nearly mustering a charm equal to ""Waking Ned Divine.""  And one has to admire the filmmakers for sidestepping the potential cliches that the film's ending could have stooped to.  David Boutin, also, plays a very likable doctor, while looking strangely like a Dominique Pinon whose body has been stretched to leading-man proportions.",4,sweet and familiar,1117238400,"05 28, 2005",2005,1375,"['Seducing', 'Doctor', 'Lewis', 'La', 'grande', 'seduction', 'story', 'remote', 'Canadian', 'community', 'old', 'fishing', 'town', 'hoping', 'seduce', 'big-city', 'doctor', 'move', 'there', 'so', 'factory', 'will', 'open', 'take', 'town', 'population', '125', 'people', 'public', 'welfare', 'Following', 'precedent', 'Doc', 'Hollywood', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'film', 'highlights', 'attractive', 'simplicity', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'almost', 'irresistible', 'audience', 'supposed', 'be', 'Doctor', 'Lewis', 'film', 'couple', 'small', 'glaring', 'conceptual', 'similarities', 'predecessors', '1', 'Doc', 'Hollywood', 'doctor', 'plastic', 'surgeon', 'i.e', 'just', 'sort', 'person', 'who', 'adorable', 'small', 'town', 'straighten', 'out', 'priorities', '2', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'doctor', 'looking', 'limited', '5-year', 'stint', 'town', 'something', 'more', 'plausible', 'seeing', 'young', 'doctor', 'dedicating', 'entire', 'future', 'career', 'town', 'just', '100', 'people', 'Seducing', 'Doctor', 'Lewis', 'seductive', 'little', 'film', 'out', 'be', 'nearly', 'mustering', 'charm', 'equal', 'Waking', 'Ned', 'Divine', 'one', 'admire', 'filmmakers', 'sidestepping', 'potential', 'cliches', 'film', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'stooped', 'David', 'Boutin', 'also', 'very', 'likable', 'doctor', 'looking', 'strangely', 'Dominique', 'Pinon', 'body', 'been', 'stretched', 'leading-man', 'proportions']",Seducing Dr. Lewis

Erland,"[0, 0]","Note: French with English subtitles.Synopsis: With the departure of the once plentiful fishing livelihood the quaint island township of St-Marie-La Mauderne is now on the verge of extinction. Their only chance for survival is to convince a plastic company to build a factory on their island that would provide jobs and self-esteem to a community on welfare. However there are two major obstacles they must first overcome if they have any hope of attracting big business;1- They must have a population of at least 210 residents and2- The must have a full-time Doctor living and practicing on the island.Those are definitely problems since they have a population of only 110 people. Now attracting a doctor, that's a problem they might be able to do something about. This film tells the story about how they went about saving their way of life.Critique: Released in '02 the lighthearted film `Seducing Dr. Lewis' (La Grande Seduction) is what I like to think of as Quebec's answer to `Waking Ned Devine'.

These movies typically emphasize the beauty of the area and the shrewdness of the villagers, and this movie is no exception.  The villagers have been living on welfare for 8 years (the fish are gone) and desperately want the respectability of paychecks -- and there's hope of attracting a factory to the town -- but they would need a doctor in the town to get a factory.  So -- they set about to attract a doctor.  They manage to get a doctor to spend a month there (not willingly -- he's forced to live there for a month to avoid a DUI conviction) and from the beginning, are determined to make him love the village so much that he'll stay.  They'll do anything to land this big fish, and that's where the comedy comes in.  This big-city surgeon is no match for the machinations of these conspiring fishermen.This film is predictable but charming.

The locals, including Germaine (Raymond Bouchard) collect their welfare checks from the post office and promptly cash them at the bank every month, proceeding from one to the other like prisoners going to the exercise yard. A company is considering the small town for a new factory, which would give the town an enormous boost, both morally and financially. The one catch is that there is no full-time doctor in residence; the company's insurance policy requires this. Germaine and his friends go about recruiting a doctor. Soon, Dr. Christopher Lewis (David Boutin) arrives, for a month trial. The townsfolk tap his phone and try to make sure that he has everything he could ever want. During the month, he also eyes the only single woman in the entire town, the post mistress. Will he be convinced to stay in the town?""Seducing Dr. Lewis"", a French Canadian film, is a charming little film, much like ""Waking Ned Devine"" or ""Local Hero"". The film depicts the lives of the people in this small town, making them believable and eccentric.""Seducing"" doesn't break any new ground, what it does is provide a sweet, sometimes funny little slice of life. As we are introduced to the characters and the town, we learn what life in St. Marie-La-Mauderne was like in the good old days, when fishing was lucrative. This is a funny segment and easily sets the tone for the remainder of the film. In present day, the town has fallen on hard times. Many of the people stay because this is what their entire lives have been. When things become so bad, some people start to move or threaten to move. The offer of a new factory is made and the town works towards that.The arrival of Dr. Lewis isn't an entirely voluntary one. Many doctors receive the notices from the town and laughingly throw them away. Dr. Lewis is ""encouraged"" to visit the town and initially scoffs at the small town. As he learns that the restaurant serves Beef Bourguignon and the town plays Cricket, two of his favorite things, he starts to warm to them. Of course, both of these things are lies and the townspeople are merely putting on a show.The film throws in a couple of complications along the way, to keep things interesting. The company building the town needs a certain number of people living in the vicinity, to adequately staff the facility. When company officials visit, Germain gives them a tour, following the townspeople from one location to the other, giving the appearance of a lot more people.The outcome of the film is predictable, perhaps, but it is also good-natured.

867708,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0006H30F4,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","'Seducing Dr. Lewis' is a quirky little film from Canada, the country which have produced many quirky little films.  But the film is a comedy, enjoyable if predictable and overlong, and should be recommended to those who love the films like 'Waking Ned Devine.'Like 'Ned,' the film is about a small community, fictional St.-Marie-La-Mauderne in Quebec Canada, and the residents who must keep on lying to 'seduce Dr. Lewis.'  This small island has only 125 people, and is seeing a gradual but steady economic depression.  In short, they need more jobs.Fortunately, there is a plan of building a new factory in this village.  Unfortunately, however, they need a doctor as full-time resident for the plan to materialize.  So what should they do?The answer is 'Seducing Dr. Lewis.'  When young doctor Christopher Lewis arrives from the mainland, the villagers join forces to provide whatever he likes without his knowing.  If they know -- in fact they spy -- that Lewis loves cricket, they not only form cricket teams of their own, but fakes a 'the final' of 'the annual competition' to show how the villagers love this sport.  Even if they don't know even how to play.[CHARMING CHARACTERS] Honestly, Dr. Lewis (David Boutin) is not as charming as the lovely villagers.  Actually, all the funny part comes from these charming people all played by Canadian actors especially Raymond Bouchard who outshines everyone else as the stubborn leader of the 'seduction' plan.  Like his character, the film is full of good-natured feelings.However, for all the praises (at Sundance, for instance), I for one didn't like some part of it.  The predictable nature of the film can be easily ignored, but as I said before, the young doctor is a rather dull character.  And if the villagers are so nice people -- and actually they all are -- you just don't need this contrived plan to convince the doctor that it's nice to live in this beautiful island.Another regrettable thing is that some characters are clearly wasted.  When you see beautiful Lucie Laurier as Eve, who distances herself from the fuss and watches Dr. Lewis with doubtful eyes, you expect something might happen between them.  Sorry, but not much.  Some may call it subdued direction.  I wanted to think so, but after seeing the film spend too much time in showing unnecessary elements like Dr. Lewis's girlfriend, I think that's only a flaw and the first-time director Jean-Franois Pouliot is to be blamed.For all its flaws, 'Seducing Dr. Lewis' is a charming comedy.  And the charms are mainly from the charming villagers played by talented Canadian actors.  And the landscape of the village.",3,"Slow-Moving and Uneven, But Charming Canadian Comedy",1125014400,"08 26, 2005",2005,2643,"[""'Seducing"", 'Dr.', 'Lewis', 'quirky', 'little', 'film', 'Canada', 'country', 'have', 'produced', 'many', 'quirky', 'little', 'films', 'film', 'comedy', 'enjoyable', 'predictable', 'overlong', 'should', 'be', 'recommended', 'who', 'love', 'films', ""'Waking"", 'Ned', 'Devine', ""'Like"", ""'Ned"", 'film', 'small', 'community', 'fictional', 'St.-Marie-La-Mauderne', 'Quebec', 'Canada', 'residents', 'who', 'must', 'keep', 'lying', ""'seduce"", 'Dr', 'Lewis', 'small', 'island', 'only', '125', 'people', 'seeing', 'gradual', 'steady', 'economic', 'depression', 'short', 'need', 'more', 'jobs.Fortunately', 'plan', 'building', 'new', 'factory', 'village', 'Unfortunately', 'however', 'need', 'doctor', 'full-time', 'resident', 'plan', 'materialize', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'answer', ""'Seducing"", 'Dr', 'Lewis', 'When', 'young', 'doctor', 'Christopher', 'Lewis', 'mainland', 'villagers', 'join', 'forces', 'provide', 'knowing', 'know', 'fact', 'spy', 'Lewis', 'cricket', 'not', 'only', 'form', 'cricket', 'teams', 'own', ""'the"", 'final', ""'"", ""'the"", 'annual', 'competition', 'show', 'how', 'villagers', 'love', 'sport', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'even', 'how', 'play', '[', 'CHARMING', 'CHARACTERS', ']', 'Honestly', 'Dr.', 'Lewis', 'David', 'Boutin', 'not', 'as', 'charming', 'lovely', 'villagers', 'Actually', 'funny', 'part', 'charming', 'people', 'played', 'Canadian', 'actors', 'especially', 'Raymond', 'Bouchard', 'who', 'everyone', 'else', 'stubborn', 'leader', ""'seduction"", 'plan', 'character', 'film', 'full', 'good-natured', 'feelings.However', 'praises', 'Sundance', 'instance', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'part', 'predictable', 'nature', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'ignored', 'said', 'young', 'doctor', 'rather', 'dull', 'character', 'villagers', 'are', 'so', 'nice', 'people', 'actually', 'are', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'contrived', 'plan', 'convince', 'doctor', 'nice', 'live', 'beautiful', 'island.Another', 'regrettable', 'thing', 'characters', 'are', 'clearly', 'wasted', 'When', 'see', 'beautiful', 'Lucie', 'Laurier', 'Eve', 'who', 'fuss', 'watches', 'Dr.', 'Lewis', 'doubtful', 'eyes', 'expect', 'something', 'might', 'happen', 'Sorry', 'not', 'much', 'may', 'call', 'subdued', 'direction', 'wanted', 'think', 'so', 'seeing', 'film', 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'showing', 'unnecessary', 'elements', 'Dr.', 'Lewis', 'girlfriend', 'think', 'only', 'flaw', 'first-time', 'director', 'Jean-Franois', 'Pouliot', 'be', 'blamed.For', 'flaws', ""'Seducing"", 'Dr.', 'Lewis', 'charming', 'comedy', 'charms', 'are', 'mainly', 'charming', 'villagers', 'played', 'talented', 'Canadian', 'actors', 'landscape', 'village']",Seducing Dr. Lewis
