842561,A3C54XWT93R2WY,B0002OXVB4,"Been around this block, several times over","[0, 1]","Good title.  Throughout I felt like I was watching a dog of a movie.  Instead of good writing and subtle acting for character development, we get sledgehammer stereotypes.  The script had all the finesse of a gumshoe story found in the sleeziest of porno mags.  Even the walking of the actors seemed a gorilla-like off-balanced hyper-macho strutting.  EVERYTHING was repeatedly over the top!!!  One reviwer gave it 4 stars and called it a sleeper.  Well, the only sleeper in the room was me, trying to stay awake to watch this flick.  The music was too loud and 1940-ish sax to hear the actors, whose enacted states of mind seldom be discerned from their statements and voice intonations.  UInteraction effects were grossly absent.  The actors seemed like robots that took a moment to scan their hard drives after the other guy did or said something i order for them to determine what they had to do next-- as if each actor knew only his/her own lines, and each seemed constantly caught by surprise that the previous speaker had finished speaking.  Overacting was abundant.  This film seemed to have been made as a drama school exercise.  And the Mike Hammer type music playing off on its own kept grating on my nerves.  It was almost as if each element and part had been recoreded independently in a booth somewhere and then put together after-the-fact.  Handgun shots sounded like Howitzers.  Breathing was also loud as hell.  What a mess.  Sorry to say all this, but it seemed to have been done by these actors just so as to pick up a couple of bucks and then get the hell out of there as fast as they could.  I hate talking this way about someone's work, but the filmmakers seemed to have no concern for the viewer-- or the poor fool who actually went out of his way to purchase this disaster.",1,"Watching a dog is ""Dog Watch""!!!",1345334400,"08 19, 2012",2012,1797,"['Good', 'title', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'dog', 'movie', 'Instead', 'good', 'writing', 'subtle', 'acting', 'character', 'development', 'get', 'sledgehammer', 'stereotypes', 'script', 'had', 'finesse', 'gumshoe', 'story', 'found', 'sleeziest', 'porno', 'mags', 'Even', 'walking', 'actors', 'seemed', 'gorilla-like', 'off-balanced', 'hyper-macho', 'strutting', 'EVERYTHING', 'was', 'repeatedly', 'top', 'One', 'reviwer', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'called', 'sleeper', 'Well', 'only', 'sleeper', 'room', 'was', 'trying', 'stay', 'awake', 'watch', 'flick', 'music', 'was', 'too', 'loud', '1940-ish', 'sax', 'hear', 'actors', 'enacted', 'states', 'mind', 'seldom', 'be', 'discerned', 'statements', 'voice', 'intonations', 'UInteraction', 'effects', 'were', 'grossly', 'absent', 'actors', 'seemed', 'robots', 'took', 'moment', 'scan', 'hard', 'drives', 'other', 'guy', 'did', 'said', 'something', 'i', 'order', 'determine', 'what', 'had', 'do', 'next', 'actor', 'knew', 'only', 'his/her', 'own', 'lines', 'seemed', 'constantly', 'caught', 'surprise', 'previous', 'speaker', 'had', 'finished', 'speaking', 'Overacting', 'was', 'abundant', 'film', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'drama', 'school', 'exercise', 'Mike', 'Hammer', 'type', 'music', 'playing', 'off', 'own', 'kept', 'grating', 'nerves', 'was', 'almost', 'element', 'part', 'had', 'been', 'recoreded', 'independently', 'booth', 'somewhere', 'then', 'put', 'together', 'after-the-fact', 'Handgun', 'shots', 'sounded', 'Howitzers', 'Breathing', 'was', 'also', 'loud', 'hell', 'What', 'mess', 'Sorry', 'say', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'actors', 'just', 'so', 'pick', 'up', 'couple', 'bucks', 'then', 'get', 'hell', 'as', 'fast', 'could', 'hate', 'talking', 'way', 'someone', 'work', 'filmmakers', 'seemed', 'have', 'concern', 'viewer', 'poor', 'fool', 'who', 'actually', 'went', 'way', 'purchase', 'disaster']",Dog Watch
