I received what I wanted.  The reinactment by the very able David Straitharn as Edward R. Murrow is noble and absorbing.  It is also a great touch that we see the actual hearings by Senator Eugene McCarthy.  It makes the movie part documentary and part reinactment, and both aspects are done admirably.  George Clooney has helped create as part director, writer, and actor a fine movie.  The behind the scenes drama where he acts as one of the key players at CBS give us a ""you-are-there"" immediacy.  And the cinematography in black and white is not only effective but beautiful.  The splendor almost gives us a fresh glossy, like from 'Life' magazine, certainly a nice touch.  Additionally, the scenes where the crew enter the nightclub transport us to this place and time.  'Good Night, and Good Luck' transports us like 'Quiz Show,' only Redford did so stunningly in color.Anyway, this is a tangible film.  They present the threat and show us how it was overcome.  Sometimes it seems so brief that we don't get all the ramifications of the McCarthy menace.  However, if even stalwart capitalist and Soviet emigre' Ann Rand disapproved of McCarthy's tactics, something must have been seriously wrong.

641593,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B00005JOKM,A Customer,"[7, 12]","Good Night and Good Luck has finally come to DVD. One of the 2005's critical darlings, with it's six Oscar nominations and heralded for it's civic-minded look at one of the great showdowns in American journalistic history, Good Night and Good Luck is supposed to be a revelation, but I found the movie to be a rather talky, dramatically antiseptic, and crushingly insular affair.Good Night and Good Luck certainly isn't a bad film, but it lacks serious oomph and impetus that should make it more watchable, and it seriously deflates in due to an over reliance on archival footage - mostly of the McCarthy hearings - and a fondness for self important and ponderous speechmaking.The See It Now crew at Columbia Broadcasting is committed to serving the public interest. They decide to air a series of reports questioning the ethics of McCarthy's headline-grabbing witch-hunt. To do so, Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) depends on the support of the show's producer, Fred Friendly (George Clooney), who joins him in kicking in personal funds to help the CBS network offset the risk of offending sponsor Alcoa. Their boss, the legendary William Paley (Frank Langella), stands behind them, but only to a point that doesn't drastically compromise his commercial interests.Splicing together the events with archival footage of McCarthy, the air - and the airwaves - gradually becomes tension-fuelled and clouded with cigarette smoke - not just because Murrow chain smokes like there's no tomorrow, but as a reminder of the corruption director George Clooney wants us to see that was part of TV from the very start.Good Night, and Good Luck is a perfectly competent terminally docudrama but it's just so dialogue driven - perhaps because the script comes from transcripts - that it ends up being decidedly un-cinematic, dry, and emotionally stunted. Also, at less than ninety minutes, the picture strangely ends before it has seemingly begun, yes - there's a kind of unofficial denouement for McCarthy, but the movie itself kind of ends in a giant anti-climactic thud.The film does, however, say a lot about the undercooked, abridged state of television news. One only has to look at an episode of 20/20 or Primetime, or even The World New Tonight to understand why Murrow spent most of his life lamenting the standards of Network journalism.Ultimately, though Good Night and Good Luck serves more as a Cliff Notes addition to the events that unfolded during McCarthy years. And although interesting, the movie would certainly have benefited with a much fuller depth. The story could have been much more developed and insightful. Good Night and Good Luck is a serious effort that makes no bones about its intention to follow the facts, even at the risk of neglectfully realizing the characters and lacking a cinematic three-act structure. But the definitive verdict - over-rated.

641594,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00005JOKM,Acute Observer,"[0, 1]","The film begins in a restaurant or night club where no one is heard. There is an award for Edward R. Murrow (who smokes like in an advertisement). Murrow talks about the use of TV to delude its viewer. The introduction is false. Senator Joseph McCarthy was not the prime mover in the Anti-Communist movement, he was at the tail-end. President Truman began his Loyalty Oath program around 1946, and there were others in Congress. This film starts in October 1953. An Air Force Lieutenant is in trouble because his father read an uncensored newspaper. Can the TV network put on this show when the sponsor has military contracts? Can someone be found guilty because of rumors? The sponsor is ""the thinking man's cigarette""!Murrow's next project will be Senator Joe McCarthy, but his staff must be above suspicion. They use the filmed speeches of McCarthy, then provide a ""truth squad"" to correct McCarthy's statements. Murrow's team wonders what the reaction would be. Then Senator McCarthy gives his response: he attacks Murrow with name calling! Murrow points out McCarthy's lack of facts. Next we learn the Senate will investigate McCarthy for using undue influence on the Army. [In 1960 a presidential candidate had a problem when his TV persona didn't match the newspaper reports.]There is a problem with this TV business. The sponsor has pulled out. News shows are more costly than game shows, and less popular. Murrow's show will be relocated to Sunday afternoon. Murrow argues for educating people about what is happening, not mindless entertaining. So what has happened since the 1950s? How educational is TV news today? Can they replace the daily newspapers? [TV is best for entertaining, newspapers for news; it's the nature of the thing.]Tabloid newspapers sell by promising to reveal unknown facts about famous persons. Are the facts true? The people who read them don't know, it occupies their minds and amuses them. TV shows (like ""Jerry Springer"" or ""Judge Judy"") display the facts about strangers to entertain viewers, all in fun. TV allowed people to see McCarthy in the flesh rather than second hand opinion in print. Live views affected the opinions of many to discredit McCarthy. TV triumphed here and went on to snatch advertising dollars from weekly national magazines and local newspapers. Perhaps a book would provide a more rounded view of the 1950s.PS The critics of this film have some unrecognized problems. People were being punished for doing something years ago that was not illegal (signing petitions!). They were punished by anonymous rumors (Amendment VI). Most of all, people who had been undercover agents could be punished for their past actions. Anyone working for the Pentagon who joined a political faction was an obvious double agent.",3,A Snapshot of Broadcasting History,1198886400,"12 29, 2007",2007,2773,"['film', 'restaurant', 'night', 'club', 'where', 'one', 'heard', 'award', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'who', 'smokes', 'advertisement', 'Murrow', 'talks', 'use', 'TV', 'delude', 'viewer', 'introduction', 'false', 'Senator', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'was', 'not', 'prime', 'mover', 'Anti-Communist', 'movement', 'was', 'tail-end', 'President', 'Truman', 'began', 'Loyalty', 'Oath', 'program', '1946', 'were', 'others', 'Congress', 'film', 'October', '1953', 'Air', 'Force', 'Lieutenant', 'trouble', 'father', 'read', 'uncensored', 'newspaper', 'Can', 'TV', 'network', 'put', 'show', 'when', 'sponsor', 'military', 'contracts', 'Can', 'someone', 'be', 'found', 'guilty', 'rumors', 'sponsor', 'thinking', 'man', 'cigarette', 'Murrow', 'next', 'project', 'will', 'be', 'Senator', 'Joe', 'McCarthy', 'staff', 'must', 'be', 'suspicion', 'use', 'filmed', 'speeches', 'McCarthy', 'then', 'provide', 'truth', 'squad', 'correct', 'McCarthy', 'statements', 'Murrow', 'team', 'what', 'reaction', 'would', 'be', 'Then', 'Senator', 'McCarthy', 'response', 'Murrow', 'name', 'calling', 'Murrow', 'out', 'McCarthy', 'lack', 'facts', 'learn', 'Senate', 'will', 'investigate', 'McCarthy', 'using', 'undue', 'influence', 'Army', '[', '1960', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'had', 'problem', 'when', 'TV', 'persona', 'did', ""n't"", 'match', 'newspaper', 'reports', ']', 'problem', 'TV', 'business', 'sponsor', 'pulled', 'out', 'News', 'shows', 'are', 'more', 'costly', 'game', 'shows', 'less', 'popular', 'Murrow', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'relocated', 'Sunday', 'afternoon', 'Murrow', 'educating', 'people', 'what', 'happening', 'not', 'mindless', 'entertaining', 'So', 'what', 'happened', '1950s', 'How', 'educational', 'TV', 'news', 'today', 'Can', 'replace', 'daily', 'newspapers', '[', 'TV', 'best', 'entertaining', 'newspapers', 'news', 'nature', 'thing', 'Tabloid', 'newspapers', 'sell', 'promising', 'reveal', 'unknown', 'facts', 'famous', 'persons', 'Are', 'facts', 'true', 'people', 'who', 'read', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'minds', 'TV', 'shows', 'Jerry', 'Springer', 'Judge', 'Judy', 'display', 'facts', 'strangers', 'entertain', 'viewers', 'fun', 'TV', 'allowed', 'people', 'see', 'McCarthy', 'flesh', 'rather', 'second', 'hand', 'opinion', 'print', 'Live', 'views', 'affected', 'opinions', 'many', 'discredit', 'McCarthy', 'TV', 'triumphed', 'here', 'went', 'snatch', 'advertising', 'dollars', 'weekly', 'national', 'magazines', 'local', 'newspapers', 'Perhaps', 'book', 'would', 'provide', 'more', 'rounded', 'view', '1950s.PS', 'critics', 'film', 'have', 'unrecognized', 'problems', 'People', 'were', 'being', 'punished', 'doing', 'something', 'years', 'was', 'not', 'illegal', 'signing', 'petitions', 'were', 'punished', 'anonymous', 'rumors', 'Amendment', 'VI', 'Most', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'undercover', 'agents', 'could', 'be', 'punished', 'past', 'actions', 'Anyone', 'working', 'Pentagon', 'who', 'joined', 'political', 'faction', 'was', 'obvious', 'double', 'agent']",N/A
641595,A3JXOXKWOIETIY,B00005JOKM,"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse""","[3, 7]","George Clooney's film concentrates on recreating the early 1950s to a tee, with black-and-white photography and scenes set up from unusual angles, punctuating the darkness of a world under threat from McCarthy.  David Strathairn, an excellent actor usually in minor roles, portrays Murrow with a believable intensity, and the GNAGL show ender grows on you.  The content on one level is kind of obscure, but concerned with historical accuracy, achieving a quiet dark and haunting intensity that makes a lasting impression.  Kind of an other-worldly realism to it.It's hard today to understand the threat posed by McCarthy's spurious accusations.  If someone called you a Communist, you'd just laugh, but back then it was a life ruiner, or percieved as such.  The clips of archive McCarthy footage interspersed with recreation was effective, and some test audiences said McCarthy's portrayal was too over-acted (not realizing it was actual McCarthy footage).  Murrow was the hero who risked standing up to the fanatical anti-Communist and took the fall for it.  And his co-worker trashed by O'brien...effectively shows the impact on McCarthyism on an individual level.I didn't quite get the significance of the secretly married couple (Robert Downey Jr.).  Anyway, the vignettes, give kind of a disjointed feel, but again the thing that makes this one worth watching is the early '50s feel...the dark ages, as well as Strathairn.

641596,A288BMI28PLPL1,B00005JOKM,"Adam L. Coleman ""Just a guy who likes movies.""","[8, 10]","There were lots of reasons why I though I wouldn't like George Clooney's little vanity project that could. For one, I am fairly conservative, and find some of the alleged excesses of the McCarthy era difficult to believe, with more the character of American national mythology than genuine veracity, and likely the result of exaggeration for the sake of agendas based very much in the here and now. For two, I generally don't like films where very little actually happens, television films belong on television. For three, I am not a big Clooney fan: basically, he acts like a scenery-chewing TV heart-throb in every film he does, probably because, at the end of the day, that is what he is - remember ER? How the man ever became a towering pillar of the Hollywood establishment is beyond me. He's alright to look at, though.Anyway, Clooney doesn't star here, that is left to David Strathairn, whose remarkable performance is at the centre of the film's success. And the plot and script, whilst they have scant serious story events to chronicle, does a pretty decent job of keeping the tension up and the banter crisp. But, undoubtedly, the greatest achievement of the film is its evocation of time and place. The sets, costumes and ubiquity of tobacco gave the undertaking a tone of extraordinary fifties authenticity.In fact, I even thought I detected an undercurrent of social criticism in the film, not the obvious one, but one that likens the paranoid crusade against communists in the fifties, to the puritanical persecution of smokers since the eighties. There were some terrific retro touches like these laced through proceedings.Bottom line: do not expect real excitement here. This is, as I mentioned above, basically a television film project, no more than a nice morsel of PC confectionary, which, with Clooney's wonder-boy touch and big-star box-office credibility, ballooned into an indie behemoth.And it utterly blew me away.P.S: This film even has something for the enlightened conservative.

Those who have opposite views of each movie may in fact find both to the yet another example of Liberal Hollywood. But I don't think of either movie has a political film. I think of both films as journalism movies and ""Good Night, And Good Luck"" is the greatest movie made about journalism since ""All the President's Men"".I've never thought much of George Clooney as an actor. I didn't like ""Batman & Robin"" I suppose ""One Fine Day"" was a cute date movie but not exactly what I would call a great movie. And I still have yet to see ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" his directorial debut but with ""Good Night, And Good Luck"" Clooney really impressed me. The strongest compliment I can give the film is that it simply rings true. The film captures the intensity that surrounds the news room and the touch choices journalist must make.Today though journalist are facing lots of pressure from the public. Many people, myself included, feel journalist are letting us down. They are not providing us with hard hitting news and when you watch many of these cable news shows and listen to what's on the radio you can see and hear the desperate trouble we are in. These people all have a political agenda, from both sides, and because of that you simply can not trust them. Today people yearn for an Edward R. Murrow to come along. Someone who will tell it to us straight.Clooney makes a lot of interesting decisions as director of this film. He sets his camera up in ways I never would have thought of but they are effective. Long shots of characters and pan overs all really caught my eye and established so much about these characters and their surroundings. But again, Clooney's biggest accomplishment is the authentic feeling he gives the film. Clooney has admitted the movie is very personal to him. His father, Nick, was a journalist, so George felt a certain obligation to make sure he got his facts rights. And I love his decision to film in black and white. To film this movie in color would have been a big mistake. It would have given the movie a much too contemporary feel. In black and white the movie now almost takes on a historical purpose. It is like a time capsule. It transports us to another time in history. A time when everyone had a cigarette in their hand and didn't have to stand outside to smoke it.I said I think of this movie as a journalism movie not political, although one could agrue the movie does have a political bent. The film and Murrow himself are presented as fighting against a government that was undermining our constitution at home while talking about freedom abroad. If you can't see the connections to today's society you have bigger problems than not being able to understand my review.David Strathairn plays Murrow picture perfect. He looks just like him and almost sounds like him. He captures the essence of the man down to the tee. An Oscar nomination would be nice. Clooney and Strathairn make Murrow out to be a man who believed television and journalist had to live up to a high level. Television Murrow thought should be used for more than just entertainment. It was and still is a tool that should be able to inform people as well. But Murrow had his faults too, though the movie does not linger on them. There were moments when Murrow was silent when he shouldn't have been. During the movie Alger Hiss is mention and Murrow's reaction to that case.But Strathairn is not the only one who delivers a wonderful performance. Robert Downey Jr., Patricia Clarkson, Jeff Daniels and Frank Langella are all believeable in their roles, especially Langella who plays the head of CBS and decides to stand by Murrow and his attacks on Sen Joseph McCarthy (who by the way plays himself). These scenes are almost too realistic in the way journalist talk and the behind the scene decisions that are made.""Good Night, And Good Luck"" is one of the year's best films.

641599,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00005JOKM,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","For those who lived in that death red scare cold war 1950s night, or who came of television age then the events depicted in this very well-done black and white documentary-like film, ""Good Night, And Good Luck"" (the signature sign-off line of Edward R. Murrow on his radio and television shows), should be very familiar. And a cause for reflection for those who howled with the wolves (the McCarthy, Nixon, Robert Welch wolves) calling for the blood of every, well, every speaker against that death night. For those who came after this should be a cautionary tale very appropriate for addressing the madnesses of the political and media howling wolves today.The story line here is pretty straight-forward, the 1953-54 struggle of Edward R. Murrow, a well-respected and honest radio and television journalist, and the rabid anti-communist monger, the junior Senator from Wisconsin, Joseph McCarthy, including actual footage of  his speeches and remarks. In that red scare cold war night few reporters, fewer liberals, and even fewer average American citizens were ready to take on the howling beasts  who, mainly for their own political  purposes, were ready to destroy infinite numbers of lives in order to ""stop the red menace"" from creeping through the door. As it turned out there were a handful of actual reds (or past reds, mainly) who may have been in the government. For that few these wolves were ready to bring the whole frail democratic experience on the American continent (what Lincoln called ""the last, best hope"") toppling down.Some guys, too few guys (or gals), like Murrow (and Fred Friendly played by George Clooney) stood up in their funny way (their cloud puff dreams of an informed, educated citizenry plugged into the world via technological promise of the global village of television seem rather ironic now) to their day's monsters.  And while we, Brother Murrow and I, may have been a million miles away from each other in age, in political and cultural sensibilities, and lifestyle I am always happy to salute a kindred spirit, an honest man seeking the truth.

641600,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B00005JOKM,Alistair McHarg,"[4, 5]","George Clooney would have done well to heed Mr. Goldwyn's famous advice before embarking on this project.  Film is an entertainment medium, not an educational one; those keen to promote an agenda are advised to provide some thrills along the way.  This said, propaganda, by definition, can never be art, and vice versa.  Add the other caveat that books should not be about writing and films should not be about film-making (TV in this case) and you've got some major Romper Room No-No's gumming up the works.There's a crawl at the beginning of Good Night, and Good Luck that briefly explains the intense paranoia clouding America in the 1950's; from coast to coast suburban housewives were discovering Communists in their underwear drawers, schoolchildren practiced surviving imaginary nuclear bombings by hiding beneath wooden desks, while enterprising dads sporting shovels and canned food built subterranean fallout shelters in their back yards.  Senator McCarthy, the very embodiment of human cowardice and demagoguery, grew organically from this atmosphere, reflecting the national malaise.  His demise is an inspiring story of decency prevailing.Unfortunately, the crawl omits its final, payoff paragraph, where Clooney points out that in today's political arena - (where the Right has become the center, the lunatic Extreme Right has become the Right, and the Left has been quietly hustled away into the witness protection program) - being a dissenter might be just as dangerous as it was in the days of the balding junior Senator from Wisconsin.  Clooney might have paraphrased Machiavelli who helpfully pointed out that if you want to control and exploit the huddled masses all you need to do is convince them there's an enemy at the gate.  Had Mr. Clooney included this paragraph in the crawl he would, of course, have been right.  He would also have spared us the pensum of watching this movie.Good Night and Good Luck is well made but painfully slow.  It is talky and ponderous; the inherent drama of the situation seems totally absent.  The best thing about it is that everyone smokes.  David Strathairn is perfect as Murrow, which is both good and bad; in addition to being a great journalist Murrow was also a stiff.  No other performances are worth mentioning except Frank Langella who is impeccable as William Paley, the man courageous enough to take on McCarthy.  Good production values, excellent B&W; cinematography, wonderful period sets - interspersing actual newsreel footage of McCarthy was a terrific idea - he hangs himself.  Perhaps most troubling of all, though, is that GNAGL will provide ammunition to those who would claim that Hollywood is an enclave of crackpot anti-American Liberal elitism - hey, didn't that happen once before?",3,"""If You Want To Send A Message, Call Western Union"" - Samuel Goldwyn",1151539200,"06 29, 2006",2006,2763,"['George', 'Clooney', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'well', 'heed', 'Mr.', 'Goldwyn', 'famous', 'advice', 'embarking', 'project', 'Film', 'entertainment', 'medium', 'not', 'educational', 'one', 'keen', 'promote', 'agenda', 'are', 'advised', 'provide', 'thrills', 'way', 'said', 'propaganda', 'definition', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'art', 'vice', 'versa', 'Add', 'other', 'caveat', 'books', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'writing', 'films', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'film-making', 'TV', 'case', ""'ve"", 'got', 'major', 'Romper', 'Room', 'No-No', 'gumming', 'up', 'works.There', 'crawl', 'beginning', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'briefly', 'intense', 'paranoia', 'clouding', 'America', '1950', 'coast', 'coast', 'suburban', 'housewives', 'were', 'discovering', 'Communists', 'underwear', 'drawers', 'schoolchildren', 'practiced', 'surviving', 'imaginary', 'nuclear', 'bombings', 'hiding', 'beneath', 'wooden', 'desks', 'enterprising', 'dads', 'sporting', 'shovels', 'canned', 'food', 'built', 'subterranean', 'fallout', 'shelters', 'back', 'yards', 'Senator', 'McCarthy', 'very', 'embodiment', 'human', 'cowardice', 'demagoguery', 'grew', 'organically', 'atmosphere', 'reflecting', 'national', 'malaise', 'demise', 'inspiring', 'story', 'decency', 'prevailing.Unfortunately', 'crawl', 'final', 'payoff', 'paragraph', 'where', 'Clooney', 'out', 'today', 'political', 'arena', 'where', 'Right', 'become', 'center', 'lunatic', 'Extreme', 'Right', 'become', 'Right', 'Left', 'been', 'quietly', 'hustled', 'away', 'witness', 'protection', 'program', 'being', 'dissenter', 'might', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'dangerous', 'was', 'days', 'balding', 'junior', 'Senator', 'Wisconsin', 'Clooney', 'might', 'have', 'paraphrased', 'Machiavelli', 'who', 'helpfully', 'pointed', 'out', 'want', 'control', 'exploit', 'huddled', 'masses', 'need', 'do', 'convince', 'enemy', 'gate', 'Had', 'Mr.', 'Clooney', 'included', 'paragraph', 'crawl', 'would', 'course', 'have', 'been', 'right', 'would', 'also', 'have', 'spared', 'pensum', 'watching', 'movie.Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'well', 'made', 'painfully', 'slow', 'talky', 'ponderous', 'inherent', 'drama', 'situation', 'totally', 'absent', 'best', 'thing', 'everyone', 'smokes', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'perfect', 'Murrow', 'good', 'bad', 'addition', 'being', 'great', 'journalist', 'Murrow', 'was', 'also', 'stiff', 'other', 'performances', 'are', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'who', 'impeccable', 'William', 'Paley', 'man', 'courageous', 'enough', 'take', 'McCarthy', 'Good', 'production', 'values', 'excellent', 'B', 'W', 'cinematography', 'wonderful', 'period', 'sets', 'interspersing', 'actual', 'newsreel', 'footage', 'McCarthy', 'was', 'terrific', 'idea', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'troubling', 'GNAGL', 'will', 'provide', 'ammunition', 'who', 'would', 'claim', 'Hollywood', 'enclave', 'crackpot', 'anti-American', 'Liberal', 'elitism', 'hey', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'once']",N/A
641601,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B00005JOKM,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[2, 3]","**WARNING** This review is full of plot spoilers!GOODNIGHT AND GOOD LUCK follows veteran CBS-TV journalist Edward R. Murrow from 1953, when he took the Air Force to task for denying a soldier a security clearance based on secret evidence and no counsel; to 1958 when he left CBS.  Along the way Murrow and staff go after Joseph McCarthy and his accusations, but allow McCarthy time to respond on the air.  McCarthy sent a letter which in no way denied anything CBS-TV or Murrow had reported, but laid on more and more name-calling.  Murrow suffered this with grace and soon therafter, Congress investigated Senator McCarthy.But there was a price to pay.  Bill Paley, head of the network (the whole corporation, in fact), advised against airing the McCarthy episode, and the show's sponsor, ALCOA, dropped the show after the McCarthy episode aired.  The vehicle for such investigation, Murrow's show SEE IT NOW, wound up in the Sunday cellar of broadcasting and increasingly Murrow had to deal with trivialities like interviewing Liberace.  About the same time in 1958 that Murray was receiving professional accolades on his career, Mr. Paley let him go, or did not stop his trying to go, ostensibly for budgetary concerns.This is a low-key but high-impact behind-the-scenes drama that plays out in semi-documentary style, using black and white and incorporating some  of the actual shows and government hearings, which of course are digitally scrubbed copies of the original film or kinescope.  Nice comedic relief is supplied by Dianne Reeves' jazz singing, which ironically comments on the action, and by the very real-feeling camaraderie among the actors playing CBS staffers.George Clooney, director, gave himself a nice subordinate role as Fred Friendly, who was often stuck in the middle between Murrow's desires as a seeker of accurate news and Bill Paley's as a businessman.  David Straithairn is wonderful as Murrow and looks a great deal like him.  Frank Langela's take on Bill Paley is especially praiseworthy. We come to understand how Paley sympathized with Murrow but ultimately had to give in to real-life concerns, like finding advertisers.  In other words this film is careful to present nuance and not tar all the journalists or all the capitalists with the same brush, quite unlike Joseph McCarthy's overheated and usually false accusations.This is just one man's opinion, but IMHO this film would be a great thing to show in high school or college as part of a U.S. History, media history or even current-events class.  The notions of secret judgments made by accuations in sealed envelopes and no resort to counsel is, sadly, still with us, as is a tendency on the part of some powerful people to impugn a citizen's patriotism rather than answer substantive questions.As of this writing, the widescreen (recommended) DVD is quite cheap:  under eight dollars.

641602,A3PPHU0A4WRODE,B00005JOKM,"allismile0 ""allismile0""","[13, 17]","So I may be black listed for giving a film that has had such accolades this year only three stars but hear me out...George Clooney directed, co-wrote, and co-starred in ""Good Evening & Good Luck"" that centers on the brave moves by Edward R. Murrow and the staff members of his show standing up to Senator McCarthy during the communist scare of the late 1940's early 50's.  The film makes it very clear that there were innocent people victimized during the senate investigations from the House of Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), and that Murrow and his staff spearheaded the ""voice of reason"" to McCarthy's sometimes brutal attacks on citizen's rights.  Unfortunately the film ignores the fact that McCarthy was not entirely wrong, and it was later uncovered that Communism was infiltrating our government in some sectors during that difficult time.  But my review is not about which way the director or producers (or myself, for that matter) lean politically, it is about the movie itself.Good Night and Good Luck has all the makings of a great movie.  Great actors and one of the best cinematographers of the day , Robert Elswit.  My main gripe with this film is that it was boring and really too broad in it's interpretation to what happened during that time to give an overall accurate sense.  If I had not known anything about the cold war and how it effected this country I would not have had any point of departure to understanding what was going on in this film.  The film jumps almost immediately into the early stages of the communist scare without giving any kind of background on how or why it started.  I never felt connected to any of the characters because there is so little detail of what drove them to ask why this was happening in the first place.Also, tension was never properly built up- things just sort of happened.  It seems to me that Clooney sacrificed tension in order to keep the pace of the film to a pleasing esthetic.  When there was supposed to be tension the only thing that kept my interest was the fact that this had really happened.In summation, I think this film lacked a strong vision and as much as I respect Clooney as an actor, and appreciate his off kilter choices in the films, I don't think he has proven himself a great directer yet.  He knows who to hire in terms of actors and off screen talent but he hasn't realized that his ability to create atmosphere as a directer is not as strong in his ability to convince the audience of his character as an actor.  While this is not a poor film, in my view, it just doesn't deserve the attention it has gotten.There are some excellent films about the cold war that are much more provacative including: Guilt By Suspicion (starring Robert DeNiro), Cradle Will Rock (directed/written by Tim Robbins) The Front (s/Woody Allen) Reds (directed/written and starring Warren Beaty).

Like most of Clooney's projects these days, it has something to say and says it very well.  The film's focal point is Edward R.

It is provocative enough to keep my attention despite it's slower pacing and the fact that it is in black and white.

It was a time when careers and lives could be ruined by innuendo.  It was a time when the process of law was strained to breaking point.  America, however, is a stronger country for having ultimately withstood this era of witch hunts.""Good Night and Good Luck"" covers the work of Edmund R Murrow and Fred Friendly as they bravely stood up against Joseph McCarthy.  They both believed in the rule of law rather than trial by media and hearsay.  Both these gentlemen are true American heroes.  In contrast, McCarthy was little more than a muckraker who, in the fullness of time, was shown as little more than a bigot.Shot entirely in black and white with George Clooney playing Friendly and David Strathairn playing Murrow, ""Good Night and Good Luck"" shows that Hollywood can still create significant films without having to resort to special effects.  The film is languid in its style and covers the flavour of the 1950s with great realism.  If colour had been used, I'm sure that the film would have had less impact.  Yet, for all its simplicity of style, the film is clever in that it uses Senator McCarthy playing himself by interspersing archival footage within the film.  This happens in a seamless manner and the film loses nothing from it.  In fact, the film gains credibility.""Good Night and Good Luck"" is probably best enjoyed by students of American history.

641607,A29X0YEL6O4KZI,B00005JOKM,"Andrew J. Dobrow ""Career Writer""","[1, 3]","Before there was Bill O'Reilly, Larry King, and Rush Limbaugh...there was Edward R. Murrow. Good Night, And Good Luck (which was Murrow's Trademark sign-off phrase) delves into the period of time where Joe McCarthy was full-steam ahead on his paranoid conquest against communism. With the help of co-workers at CBS, Murrow took on a quest of his own. To make a change. To take down Joe McCarthy for his ruthless treatment of innocent people and to clue the American people into the absurdity of McCarthy's accusations.Good Night. And Good Luck is filmed totally in black and white. Though, don't think that makes the movie any less vivid! The black and white actually gives the film a very crisp feel. It also enables director George Clooney to experiment with the lighting. The lighting was very well done and exceeds in giving the movie the claustrophobic feel that it was meant to have. Clooney also seemed to focus a lot of his attention on the actors faces. The film consists of many close up shots, which at some points was a blessing, and other times was a curse. The close-ups on Jeff Daniels worked very well since he has such good facial control and a natural talent to forget about the camera. On some of the close ups of David Stratharin, especially the portions of the film where the character of Murrow is broadcasting his show, an aura of overacting hangs over his head. It's not that he did a bad role, it's just that he was trying to hard to catch the dead-eye intensity of Edward G. Murrow. But in his defense, there are other times where the close ups look totally natural for him.David Strathairn does an overall good performance of Murrow. With the exception of the few scenes I mentioned above, the performance was a natural fit for Strathairn. The supporting acting, with the exception of Jeff Daniels was just...I guess the nice way to put it is plain. I expected a much better performance out of Robert Downey Jr. who usually rarely disappoints. George Clooney himself does a somewhat believable job as Fred Friendly, but just like Strathairn, at times the role was overplayed.The plot is based on historical fact. The footage of Joe McCarthy is the actual archival film from the 50's. Interesting fact I picked up while researching the film; When the movie was first screened, people complained that the actor that played Joe McCarthy was overacting. The funny thing is that it was in fact actual film of McCarthy's speeches. Though one thing that puzzled me about the film is the additional under plot of Robert Downey Jr. and his wife trying to hide their marriage because of company policy. It just didn't seem to serve any purpose to the meaning of the film.In a perfect world, Jeff Daniels would of at least of been nominated for a supporting acting Oscar, George Clooney would of won the award for achievmant in direction, and Robert Elswit would of won for cinematography. But in our world full of political driven descions and biased personal views, Good Luck, and Good Night had a snow balls chance in hell of winning any awards while dealing with such films as Brokeback Mountain and Crash. Maybe on a different year or era, this film would have been offered more of a chance to Academy consideration. But in this world of paranoia and terror, a movie so honest about the fears and compulsions that live in us all. The overall theme of the movie is what is important, which is said best by Ed Murrow himself: ""We can not defend freedom abroad if we defeat it at home"".4/5",4,"Kiss Off, Ya Commie!",1143244800,"03 25, 2006",2006,3507,"['was', 'Bill', ""O'Reilly"", 'Larry', 'King', 'Rush', 'Limbaugh', 'was', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'was', 'Murrow', 'Trademark', 'sign-off', 'phrase', 'period', 'time', 'where', 'Joe', 'McCarthy', 'was', 'full-steam', 'ahead', 'paranoid', 'conquest', 'communism', 'help', 'co-workers', 'CBS', 'Murrow', 'took', 'quest', 'own', 'make', 'change', 'take', 'down', 'Joe', 'McCarthy', 'ruthless', 'treatment', 'innocent', 'people', 'clue', 'American', 'people', 'absurdity', 'McCarthy', 'accusations.Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'filmed', 'totally', 'black', 'white', 'Though', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'less', 'vivid', 'black', 'white', 'actually', 'film', 'very', 'crisp', 'feel', 'also', 'director', 'George', 'Clooney', 'experiment', 'lighting', 'lighting', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'exceeds', 'giving', 'movie', 'claustrophobic', 'feel', 'was', 'meant', 'have', 'Clooney', 'also', 'seemed', 'focus', 'lot', 'attention', 'actors', 'film', 'many', 'close', 'up', 'shots', 'points', 'was', 'blessing', 'other', 'times', 'was', 'curse', 'close-ups', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'worked', 'very', 'well', 'such', 'good', 'facial', 'control', 'natural', 'talent', 'forget', 'camera', 'close', 'ups', 'David', 'Stratharin', 'especially', 'portions', 'film', 'where', 'character', 'Murrow', 'broadcasting', 'show', 'aura', 'overacting', 'hangs', 'head', 'not', 'did', 'bad', 'role', 'just', 'was', 'trying', 'hard', 'catch', 'dead-eye', 'intensity', 'Edward', 'G.', 'Murrow', 'defense', 'are', 'other', 'times', 'where', 'close', 'ups', 'look', 'totally', 'natural', 'him.David', 'Strathairn', 'overall', 'good', 'performance', 'Murrow', 'exception', 'few', 'scenes', 'mentioned', 'performance', 'was', 'natural', 'fit', 'Strathairn', 'supporting', 'acting', 'exception', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'was', 'just', 'guess', 'nice', 'way', 'put', 'plain', 'expected', 'much', 'better', 'performance', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'who', 'usually', 'rarely', 'disappoints', 'George', 'Clooney', 'somewhat', 'believable', 'job', 'Fred', 'Friendly', 'just', 'Strathairn', 'times', 'role', 'was', 'overplayed.The', 'plot', 'based', 'historical', 'fact', 'footage', 'Joe', 'McCarthy', 'actual', 'archival', 'film', '50', 'Interesting', 'fact', 'picked', 'up', 'researching', 'film', 'When', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'screened', 'people', 'complained', 'actor', 'played', 'Joe', 'McCarthy', 'was', 'overacting', 'funny', 'thing', 'was', 'fact', 'actual', 'film', 'McCarthy', 'speeches', 'one', 'thing', 'puzzled', 'film', 'additional', 'plot', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'wife', 'trying', 'hide', 'marriage', 'company', 'policy', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'serve', 'purpose', 'meaning', 'film.In', 'perfect', 'world', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'would', 'least', 'been', 'nominated', 'supporting', 'acting', 'Oscar', 'George', 'Clooney', 'would', 'won', 'award', 'achievmant', 'direction', 'Robert', 'Elswit', 'would', 'won', 'cinematography', 'world', 'full', 'political', 'driven', 'descions', 'biased', 'personal', 'views', 'Good', 'Luck', 'Good', 'Night', 'had', 'snow', 'balls', 'chance', 'hell', 'winning', 'awards', 'dealing', 'such', 'films', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'Crash', 'Maybe', 'different', 'year', 'era', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'offered', 'more', 'chance', 'Academy', 'consideration', 'world', 'paranoia', 'terror', 'movie', 'so', 'honest', 'fears', 'compulsions', 'live', 'overall', 'theme', 'movie', 'what', 'important', 'said', 'best', 'Ed', 'Murrow', 'can', 'not', 'defend', 'freedom', 'abroad', 'defeat', 'home', '.4/5']",N/A

This sobriquet is debatable, depending on where one stands on the issue of the senator's anti-Communist activities. The program was the culmination of a series of Murrow studies of what some called the Red Scare. There's no question its carefully selected film clips of McCarthy in action were destructive to the senator's reputation and cause, and yet, the words, tactics and demeanor were his. The American people needed to see this program, for the Army/McCarthy hearings upon which it greatly drew were daytime broadcasts unavailable to most working folks.SYNOPSIS--In GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK, CBS news pioneer Edward R. Murrow takes on Wisconsin's junior senator, Joseph McCarthy, who in 1954 fights for his political life while looking for Reds in government, the military and within the ranks of Murrow's own employer. Both McCarthy and Murrow eventually end up as losers.David Strathairn handles well Murrow's vocal style and tone. The recreation of a bygone era by a first-rate cast is ably executed, yet there's some vital thing absent the film, perhaps post-broadcast details or a well-defined outcome, that leaves a viewer uneasy.

Murrow's words, heard again 50 years later in Good Night, and Good Luck. If indeed George Clooney and Company set out to make a contemporary political point, then they have succeeded in a remarkable and entertaining film.Like Murrow's treatment of McCarthy, Clooney & Co. let the material speak for itself to voice their dissent. It is refreshing (and rare) to see Hollywood people score an intelligent political point.Many people are familiar with the See It Now broadcasts about Air Force Reserve Lt. Milo Radulovich, Senator McCarthy and McCarthy's rebuttal. Kinescope films of the broadcasts are shown in journalism classes. Good Night, and Good Luck is so true to the material that it will likely replace those kines in classrooms.David Straithairn is fabulous as Murrow, his voice and physical demeanor--especially while ""on the air""--are perfect. Clooney is much better looking than Fred Friendly but he carries off the role just fine.As an entirely separate matter, the film does cause one to reflect upon television news today. In 2005 it is a promise betrayed best described as an abuse of technology with the motto, ""if it bleeds, it leads"" and driven by the ethic, ""fake it until you make it"".Contrasting what we see today on every channel with the CBS News that we see in this movie is a painful reminder of television's broken promise.The networks were privately owned when See It Now was broadcast and while people like CBS's Bill Paley and RCA's David Sarnoff were business giants, they didn't put profit over everything: news divisions were allowed to lose money in exchange for the respectability they bestowed on the network (or TV station). Then a consultant invented the Eyewitness News format and profit from news was discovered. The result exchanged Murrow's seriousness-of-purpose for pompous self-importance while retaining not a bit of his integrity.",5,It is refreshing (and rare) to see Hollywood people make an intelligent political point,1129248000,"10 14, 2005",2005,1982,"['can', 'not', 'defend', 'freedom', 'abroad', 'deserting', 'home.This', 'often', 'said', 'today', 'are', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'words', 'heard', 'again', '50', 'years', 'later', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'indeed', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Company', 'set', 'out', 'make', 'contemporary', 'political', 'point', 'then', 'have', 'succeeded', 'remarkable', 'entertaining', 'film.Like', 'Murrow', 'treatment', 'McCarthy', 'Clooney', 'Co.', 'let', 'material', 'speak', 'voice', 'dissent', 'refreshing', 'rare', 'see', 'Hollywood', 'people', 'score', 'intelligent', 'political', 'point.Many', 'people', 'are', 'familiar', 'See', 'Now', 'Air', 'Force', 'Reserve', 'Lt.', 'Milo', 'Radulovich', 'Senator', 'McCarthy', 'McCarthy', 'rebuttal', 'Kinescope', 'films', 'broadcasts', 'are', 'shown', 'journalism', 'classes', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'so', 'true', 'material', 'will', 'likely', 'replace', 'kines', 'classrooms.David', 'Straithairn', 'fabulous', 'Murrow', 'voice', 'physical', 'demeanor', 'especially', 'air', 'are', 'perfect', 'Clooney', 'much', 'better', 'looking', 'Fred', 'Friendly', 'role', 'just', 'fine.As', 'entirely', 'separate', 'matter', 'film', 'cause', 'one', 'reflect', 'television', 'news', 'today', '2005', 'promise', 'betrayed', 'best', 'described', 'abuse', 'technology', 'motto', 'driven', 'ethic', 'fake', 'make', '.Contrasting', 'what', 'see', 'today', 'channel', 'CBS', 'News', 'see', 'movie', 'painful', 'reminder', 'television', 'broken', 'promise.The', 'networks', 'were', 'privately', 'owned', 'when', 'See', 'Now', 'was', 'broadcast', 'people', 'CBS', 'Bill', 'Paley', 'RCA', 'David', 'Sarnoff', 'were', 'business', 'giants', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'profit', 'everything', 'news', 'divisions', 'were', 'allowed', 'lose', 'money', 'exchange', 'respectability', 'bestowed', 'network', 'TV', 'station', 'Then', 'consultant', 'invented', 'Eyewitness', 'News', 'format', 'profit', 'news', 'was', 'discovered', 'result', 'exchanged', 'Murrow', 'seriousness-of-purpose', 'pompous', 'self-importance', 'retaining', 'not', 'bit', 'integrity']",N/A

It is a very understated movie, but if you let it reveal itself to you, it is excellent, and in my opinion, one of the best films of the new century.I noticed that some reviewers feel that the movie lacked some emotion.

Downey Jr., as always, does a fantastic job, and any potential faults of the other performances seem to disappear thanks to Clooney's direction.As for the DVD, the extras are a bit skimpy. There is a nice commentary by Clooney and co-screenwriter Heslov, as well as a ""companion piece"" about the making of the film, in context of the guidance of relatives of those involved in the Murrow/McCarthy feud. I think that there could certainly be more stuff to throw out there, from archival footage not used in the film and perhaps the rise of McCarthyism.Otherwise, this movie is great. Strathairn gives an awesome performance as Murrow, and the movie manages to flesh out the personalities, the triumphs, and the tragedies surrounding this time in US history within 90 minutes.",5,Maybe 4.5 stars...,1186790400,"08 11, 2007",2007,1638,"['still', '*true*', 'winner', 'Best', 'Picture', '2006', 'think', 'GNGL', 'something', 'revelation', 'create', 'inspired', 'iconography', 'smacking', 'viewer', 'head', 'Clooney', 'direction', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'display', 'excellent', 'use', 'B', 'W', 'then', 'almost', 'eavesdropping-like', 'quality', 'shots', 'least', 'entertaining', 'hell', 'very', 'understated', 'movie', 'let', 'reveal', 'excellent', 'opinion', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'new', 'century.I', 'noticed', 'reviewers', 'feel', 'movie', 'lacked', 'emotion', 'can', 'understand', 'certain', 'degree', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'script', 'did', 'become', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'too', 'verbose', 'characters', 'who', 'probably', 'did', 'not', 'talk', 'certainly', 'not', 'reflective', 'actors', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'always', 'fantastic', 'job', 'potential', 'faults', 'other', 'performances', 'seem', 'disappear', 'thanks', 'Clooney', 'direction.As', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'bit', 'skimpy', 'nice', 'commentary', 'Clooney', 'co-screenwriter', 'Heslov', 'as', 'well', 'companion', 'piece', 'making', 'film', 'context', 'guidance', 'relatives', 'involved', 'Murrow/McCarthy', 'feud', 'think', 'could', 'certainly', 'be', 'more', 'stuff', 'throw', 'out', 'there', 'archival', 'footage', 'not', 'used', 'film', 'perhaps', 'rise', 'McCarthyism.Otherwise', 'movie', 'great', 'Strathairn', 'awesome', 'performance', 'Murrow', 'movie', 'flesh', 'out', 'personalities', 'triumphs', 'tragedies', 'surrounding', 'time', 'US', 'history', '90', 'minutes']",N/A

Other films capture the process better, perhaps -- Ron Howard's somewhat overlooked film, The Paper, gets to the heart of that wonderfully -- but the black humor, the second-guessing, the shaking leg hidden beneath the desk even as one shows a steely resolve to the world, it's all here, it's all right and it's all terrifically communicated.A sensational film and unreservedly recommended.",5,"A great look at journalism, as well as a reminder for journalists of their mission.",1142467200,"03 16, 2006",2006,1161,"['Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'seen', 'commentary', 'today', 'political', 'climate', 'lot', 'viewers', 'certainly', 'easy', 'do', 'McCarthyism', 'more', 'ongoing', 'current', 'American', 'political', 'life', 'many', 'might', 'want', 'admit', 'rather', 'something', 'ugly', 'head', 'murk', 'periodically.But', 'film', 'less', 'today', 'political', 'climate', 'giving', 'contemporary', 'journalists', 'hard', 'shake', 'so', 'many', 'have', 'forgotten', 'questioning', 'authority', 'whoever', 'might', 'be', 'given', 'moment', 'reason', ""'ve"", 'been', 'given', 'legal', 'social', 'protections', 'have.As', 'working', 'journalist', 'also', 'find', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'accurate', 'portrayals', 'journalists', 'film', 'Other', 'films', 'capture', 'process', 'better', 'perhaps', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'somewhat', 'overlooked', 'film', 'Paper', 'heart', 'wonderfully', 'black', 'humor', 'second-guessing', 'shaking', 'leg', 'hidden', 'desk', 'even', 'one', 'steely', 'resolve', 'world', 'here', 'right', 'terrifically', 'communicated.A', 'sensational', 'film', 'unreservedly', 'recommended']",N/A
641615,A1MR1VMK999I6O,B00005JOKM,"Beth DeRoos ""Beth DeRoos from the California ...","[2, 3]","It's hard to know where to begin, since this is one film that is so excellent, that one is actually left in awe.  Maybe one had to have been alive, even as a child in the early fifties to appreciate this film, but I hope that isn't the case.The actors/actressess are perfect for the characters they played, and I appreciated the way the doubting or worried aspects of what Edward R. Murrow wanted to do was felt by the higher ups at CBS and even ALCOA.  Since I think many people who see the movie for the first time will not know that even into the sixties, certain shows on television were underwritten by one company via their ads.  So it wasn't as if Murrow/CBS could look for new advertisers since ALCOA was the advertiser for the show.George Clooney is good as Fred W. Friendly, whom I enjoyed when he hosted PBS shows on free speech and the constitution. David Strathairn is so on target as Edward R. Murrow  I had to remind myself this was a movie and he was an actor playing the part.  Murrows specials on television had a profound effect on me as a child and probably played a bigger role in me developing a deep empathy for those less fortunate than I was/am and becoming a walk the talk person that I am today.Frank Langella, plays CBS head William Paley so well and allows the viewer a wee glimpse into the roller coaster ride of emotions internally and externally Paley must have been enduring. Again one needs reminders that this was the fifties decades before 24hr news and instant responding to news stories.Patricia Clarkson and Robert Downey Jr. are excellent as the secretly married couple  Shirley and Joe Wershba  working in the Murrow group at a time when CBS like many companies didn't allow in house dating or married couples.  I liked their characters because its nice to be reminded of what it was like in the 50's for couples who fell in love at CBS and other top corporations.And I appreciated the newsman that Ray Wise played  Don Hollenbeck because it reminded me of news stories I read in the newspaper as a child, where I would have to stop reading and ask my parents what words meant. Thankfully they never discouraged me from hearing or reading the truth, so I knew of people who had 'died' or had been black listed due to rumors that destroyed their lives.  Don Hollenbeck's wife left and his life was in a mess, because of rumors. Like those spread when the Robert Downing Jr. character Joe Wershba was handed a plain manilla envelope outside the Senate office by one of Senator Joseph McCarthy's errand men.  The purpose was to try and frighten CBS and Murrow into silence by concocting a story that Murrow and others at CBS had been either red or pink, and thus were doing the enemies work.The cinematography in black and white and how realistic it is in allowing the story to flow seamless with never heavy dead zones that allow the viewers mind to wander.  Then there are the real news reel pieces of Senator Joseph McCarthy and how it was his own words that brought him down, but also his own words and actions that struck fear and loathing into so many Americans.  This is the part of the movie with Murrows comments and questions along with the real Senator Joseph McCarthy words and news reels that cause one pause in 2006.  A real wake up call for those willing to shut up and listen.By using real news footage of Senator Joseph McCarthy rather than an actor, the producers and director allowed the viewer to see and hear firsthand what the Senator was saying and doing, whereas using an actor and putting words into his mouth would or could have resulted in criticism that the movie makers were making things up to make either Senator Joseph McCarthy or some present day politicians look or sound bad.  By using real news footage of Senator Joseph McCarthy one saw and heard the real deal.An added treat is Diane Reeves singing 50's jazz favorites whose words match so well to the dialogue that preceded her singing. That's a sign of a well thought out and planned movie to me.  Its these small elements that when blended with the bigger elements make for a movie that makes many peoples top favorite movies.Equally interesting and on par with President Dwight D. Eisenhower's warnings about the United States becoming an industrial military complex, were the musings of Murrow and even Paley about what viewers would sit still for.  The concern was that viewers wanted more entertainment, but Murrow insisted that an occasional reminder of civics and constitutional issues would be welcomed.Thus the movie again reminds me of some of my favorite Murrow quotes. 'We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. When the loyal opposition dies, I think the soul of America dies with it', 'We cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home', 'Seldom, if ever, has a war ended leaving the victors with such a sense of uncertainty and fear -- with such a realization that the future is obscure and that survival is not assured' and  'Just once in a while let us exalt the importance of ideas and information'

However, my favorite movies were in Technicolor.There was no excitement in the CBS studios, and it took a multitude of people to get that show 'on the air.'  Even the behind-the-scenes ""action,"" accusations, etc. didn't get a stir from Murrow.  And George Clooney as Friendly wasn't very ... friendly.  His inherited good looks (Hi, Nick!) couldn't carry this dull story.  He wasn't  his usual suave, debonair presence.I felt cheated to have to pay full price to see B&W; when I grew up loving the vividness of Technicolor.  Back then, in the movies, everything was bigger than life.  In this feature movie, nothing was life; it was all downplaying important people as if they were ordinary.His interview with Liberace was 'informative' but average; I guess folks of that decade would not have caught the innuendo.  His show was nothing compared to 'This Is Your Life.'  I wasn't old enough to appreciate a smoking dragon of a newsman.  He went too far with his ego-forced antagonism against McCarthy.  None of us liked what he was doing, but we didn't pay $3,000 to get our point of view on television.  I'm surprised he was allowed to get away with it, as newscasters are supposed to be imparital, or at least portray imparitality.Their realities of life in New York were not our realities in the smaller towns.  Granted, McCarthy ruined many lives including his own, but that smoking and advertising Kent cigarettes also killed people with its own poison.I was expecting too much from George Clooney, as I do admire his dad; they are both incredibly talented.

This film, if my memory serves me correctly, is an accurate retelling of the events as they unfolded.  David Strathairn is excellent as Edward R. Murrow.  To me he actually channeled Murrow.  His characterization is spot on and it felt as if I was actually watching Murrow.  McCarthy is played by himself through the use of news footage.

This is film-making and tension at its best. Although there's no bloodshed or external battles, the strain of what was going on during the McCarthy hearings in the 50's is palpable in George Clooney's excellent script.Not having been born until years later, I only remember my parents commenting on how disgraceful the nation felt for letting a bully push around individuals and companies without due process here in the U.S. (where we pride ourselves on a system of justice!)The film is taut with dangerous choices that could have very well ended the careers of thousands of people at CBS. Edward R. Murrow (played beautifully by David Strathairn) pulls off the performance of a lifetime by using every mannerism ever noted in Murrow's early television career. The close-up facial shots were excellent and added tension to the film without any musical score (music is only used as a kind of introduction to different segments of the story but sung in low jazz tones by legendary singer Dianne Reeves). The use of black and white film adds an extra sense of the time period and allowed George Clooney and company to meld together stock footage of McCarthy and other Senators in a very seamless fashion.It is noteworthy to point out that fear was the prime method that allowed McCarthy to continue his ridiculous claims of communist infiltration into the United States (people feared the communists because of the nuclear threat and because they felt that the communists would overrun our beloved country ....boy, does this sound familiar. Are we still in the 1950s? Hmm. Is George Bush and company allowed to get away with lots of things because of the fear of bombings, religious fundamentalists, and those who disagree with America?)The ""you're either with us or against us"" mentality is easily focused on in the film by allowing Senator McCarthy to play and hang himself. If you were against McCarthy, you were a communist or, at the very least, a communist sympathizer (watching him attack Murrow as a communist was ridiculous).It's funny to read the mind-numbing reviews of individuals here at Amazon.com who think that there WERE communists in high places within our government.

641623,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B00005JOKM,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[4, 5]","Joseph McCarthy was an unusual character in American politics and the events surrounding him and his paranoia scare regarding supposed Communists are legendary. This movie brings some of the hysteria of that era to the big screen, delivered from the perspective of one courageous broadcast journalist who had the guts to challenge McCarthy on live television. Ed Murrow was that man, and he rose to the challenge because he knew McCarthy had overstepped the boundaries of decency and constitutional law. He felt it was time that someone take a stand and expose all of this nonsense once and for all.This movie takes an interesting angle in the McCarthy saga and it isn't quite the angle I expected. I assumed this would be a movie that was basically a biography about McCarthy with an actor playing the role of McCarthy, allowing the viewer to see the Wisconsin Senator up close and perhaps get a better understanding of the motives that led McCarthy to behave the way he did. But this movie isn't like that. Instead, it presents McCarthy from the perspective of a broadcast journalist, with most of the footage in the movie taken from inside a broadcasting office. Actual scenes from the past are shown in this movie, with McCarthy interrogating suspected Communists during official government hearings. While these scenes are running in the background, the actors and actresses in the movie respond to what they see and calculate their next move.This movie takes its name from Murrow's signature close to his television and radio shows. He would always end the broadcast by saying ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" and it became the phrase everyone associated with this respected newsman. The film begins and ends with Murrow talking to the viewer and these segments are taken from a 1959 speech where he discussed the merits of television as a communication medium. Murrow felt that television had much to offer and was an excellent means for staying informed about the world but only if viewers pay close attention to what is said and only if they think about the pros and cons of the information fed to them from the people on the screen.Clooney decided to film this movie in black and white, which adds to its appeal. You feel like you are observing an actual moment of history. The black and white scenes combined with real footage of McCarthy makes this move seem realistic- like a hidden camera was placed in the back rooms at CBS News in the early 1950's and it has now resurfaced for everyone to enjoy for the first time.One other thing about this movie that I liked (but others may not) is the general chaos that is felt from time to time. Like I said before, most of the scenes in this movie take place right in the offices at CBS. There is a scene in a restaurant, one in a bar, and one in the Wershba's home but other than that, all of the scenes are from the offices. When the guys and gals in the offices talk, they tend to talk all at once so you have to decide whom to focus your attention. Some people might criticize this and other scenes like it because it's difficult to know what is going on and it seems a tad sloppy. But I liked it because it adds to the movie's realism. Journalists, when they are deciding what to report and how to report it, tend to be outspoken and like to get their points across. They talk all at once with little regard for order.The cinematography in this movie is interesting and besides the black and white, you get to witness plenty of indoor scenery courtesy of the early 1950's. Most of the people depicted in this movie are smokers and the sight of the toxic fumes billowing up from a lighted Kent or expelling from the mouth or nostrils of one of the characters catches your attention. Even if you're the anti- smoking type and don't like to see smoking on the big screen, this is one instance where you will probably be able to forgive the movie makers. Smoking was common during this time, and the sight of smoke actually adds to the cinematography of the movie.With the performances, let's just say that most all of them are top notch and well deserving of recognition. David Strathairn is the most memorable and he really has the persona and speaking style of Edward Murrow down pat. Clooney and his comrades are also very good. With the outspokenness, the clapping, the cheering each other on, etc, they portray the attitudes and mannerisms of journalists quite well.Overall, ""Good Night and Good Luck"" is a very good movie that shows how one man was able to make a difference by helping to bring an end to the McCarthy ""witch hunts"" of the early 1950's. It isn't a biography, so don't go into this expecting to learn a great deal about McCarthy as a person. What you will learn is how important it is to take these anti- democratic actions, like those of McCarthy and other politicians, more seriously than before. McCarthy may be gone, but his tactics and paranoia are likely to surface again in one form or another. Like Ed Murrow himself would warn, we need to take these threats seriously to ensure they don't go too far and to make sure that Constitutional protections remain intact.",4,Very Good Historical Film

641627,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B00005JOKM,C. B Collins Jr.,"[1, 2]","""Good Night and Good Luck"" is a gem of a film. It is designed for thoughtful and sophisticated viewers and it certainly hits the spot. Going back to the 1950s when Senator Joe McCarthy was terrorizing government employees and the entertainment industry with his communism witch hunt, the film focuses on the heroic response of Edward R. Murrow and his willingness to confront McCarthy in the public arena where he might be truly defeated and made accountable for his actions. ""Good Night and Good Luck"" was the sign-off slogan of early television pioneer, Edward R. Murrow. The film is so cleverly made that a viewer does not really need to know the history of Joe McCarthy and Edward R. Murrow, the senator and the celebrated World War II broadcaster, to fully appreciate the struggle. Imagine what it must have been like to have this clash of the titans on national public television. One force preying on human fear and ignorance and the other appealing to man's better nature. When was the last time the media and the policy makers relied on man's better nature?  It is a rare occurrence.In this day and time it is difficult to imagine the fear of Communism that drove the McCarthy hearings and his efforts to destroy the lives and career of anyone remotely connected to socialism. There is an amazing part of this film where a cafeteria worker who has been promoted to send coded messages is grilled by the Senator and his aid Roy Cohn, when the poor woman is obviously not a member of the Communist party.Filming in black and white evoked the 1950s and the quick breakaway shots captured the fast tempo of newsrooms that broadcast live to the nation every night. Director George Clooney made wise decisions to keep the film in the vernacular of the 1950s to help give it a time and place in the mind of the viewers. The integration of actual news footage, particularly of McCarthy, were integrated perfectly into the film.Actor David Strathairn is superb as Murrow, a man of considerable bravery and control, who seems to be ever supported by his faith in his fellow man to think through the issues, to deliberate with caution and wisdom, and to make the best decisions. Wow, does any of us have such faith in their fellow man as Murrow seemed to have for his viewers during the McCarthy reign of terror.Frank Langella as Bill Paley and Clooney as Fred Friendly offered the opportunities for dialogue and to penetrate the personal philosophy behind Murrow's public actions. They demonstrate that often great actions require great coverage which Paley, President of CBS, offered to Murrow.  Furthermore, Murrow was the voice that brought the struggle of London during World War II and he dare not waste his public trust capital with the American public. He used his public trust well in the service of the American system and the American people.""Good Night and Good Luck"" is a sophisticated film that holds its audience in the highest regard, much in line with the political social philosophy of Murrow. The film opens however with a warning that television could become only a tool of entertainment and not for public education and information.The supporting cast was superb, including Robert Downey Jr., Patricia Clarkson, Matt Ross, Reed Diamond, and Jeff Daniels.  The relationship between CBS' CEO, William Paley (Frank Langella in) and Murrow is supportive, professional, and full of integrity on the part of both parties.

CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[2, 3]","Cassius was right, the fault dear Brutus is not in our stars, but in ourselves""Good Night, and Good Luck."" is about broadcaster Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) and the role he played in bringing down Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself, in archival footage). Senator McCarthy exploited the atmosphere of fear during 1950's America, the height of the cold war with Russia, then called the Soviet Union, claiming to have lists of Communist spies in government, and later, claiming that the Army was infested with Communist spies. If anyone questioned him, he would attack them as being a Communist, a Communist Sympathizer, or a Fellow Traveler. Murrow was not a Communist, a sympathizer, or a fellow traveler, but he did oppose the methods and tactics used by McCarthy.---------Edward R. Murrow: We cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home.=====================Though there was groundswell of opposition to McCarthy among print journalists, no one on Television news was bold enough to take him on until Edward R. Murrow. Television proved an effective weapon against the Senator. After the program challenging him aired, he demanded equal time. He spoke for 28 minutes, but the longer he spoke, the more he seemed unhinged, and the less people thought of him. When ABC aired the McCarthy/Army hearings (Murrow was on CBS) that finished him. He had really gone too far, accusing the Army of harboring numerous Communists. As President Eisenhower quipped, McCarthyism became McCarthywasm. The Senate voted to censure him, one of the few times in history that has happened. Though he was not thrown out of office, he was stripped of his committee chair, and yielded little influence thereafter. He died still in office a few years later. Some say the illness was brought on by acute alcoholism.""Good Night, and Good Luck."" is not so much about McCarthy, but about Murrow, and the pressures brought to bear on him, by CBS, and also by McCarthy. It is not a biopic of Murrow, but focuses on the period when McCarthyism was in full flower, and also, as bookends at the beginning and end of the film, it has Murrow railing against using the medium of television merely to entertain, distract, or to insulate the viewer from reality:--------------Edward R. Murrow: We have currently a built-in allergy to unpleasant or disturbing information. Our mass media reflect this. But unless we get up off our fat surpluses and recognize that television in the main is being used to distract, delude, amuse, and insulate us, then television and those who finance it, those who look at it, and those who work at it, may see a totally different picture too late.=========================It is a period piece, and everyone smokes like a chimney, especially Murrow.  Tobacco companies sponsor the show, and good use is made of a period commercial, with the irony of one cigarette company claiming to be the ""thinking man's cigarette."" Murrow smoked a different brand, but he would put it in his sponsor's box.""Good Night, and Good Luck."" was a successful film, in oh-so-many ways. You could say that it didn't make much money, but it was made for only seven million. It made $54,641,191 in combined foreign and domestic box office returns, according to boxofficemojo dot com. It returned the initial investment more than sevenfold. George Clooney believed in this project so much that he only paid himself a dollar, as writer, director, and actor. He also mortgaged his own home to get it made. I think one of the reasons the picture appealed to him was because his own father was a news anchor.Though GNAGL didn't win an Oscar, it did get nominated for six, including best picture. It was one of the best reviewed films of the year, for independent films in limited theatrical release. It was the first film released entirely in black & white since The Elephant Man. Director George Clooney artfully combined archival footage with newly shot film. The film is a master class in how to make a great looking film on a low budget. There are so many clever technical feats, but they are pulled off flawlessly. Clooney makes it all look so easy.There is also some great acting by George Clooney, Patricia Clarkson, Robert Downey Jr., Frank Langella, Ray Wise, Jeff Daniels -- and Dianne Reeves fronts a jazz group that acts as a kind-of Greek chorus, commenting on the action -- but the performance by David Strathairn is stunning, and the film's centerpiece. The fact that he nailed most of his scenes on the first take also helped bring this film in under budget. Straithairn is one of Hollywood's best kept secrets, but his relative anonymity allowed him to inhabit the role, without the distraction of seeing some celebrity up on screen pretending to be someone.Clooney has really achieved something here, as he has made a film made up mostly of talking heads, but managed to make it entertaining as a movie. It actually has quite a bit of substance, and yet it is still watch-able. If it were a cigarette, it would be the thinking man's cigarette.-----------Edward R.

Murrow: To those who say people wouldn't look; they wouldn't be interested; they're too complacent, indifferent and insulated, I can only reply: There is, in one reporter's opinion, considerable evidence against that contention. But even if they are right, what have they got to lose? Because if they are right, and this instrument is good for nothing but to entertain, amuse and insulate, then the tube is flickering now and we will soon see that the whole struggle is lost. This instrument can teach, it can illuminate; yes, and it can even inspire. But it can do so only to the extent that humans are determined to use it to those ends. Otherwise it is merely wires and lights in a box.

Murrow and George Clooney as his producer and ally Fred Friendly. Murrow, like many Americans of the era, was fed up with Joseph McCarthy's witch hunt of alleged Communists and decided to take a stand against him on his popular ""See It Now"" program on CBS. Murrow wasn't the first journalist to go after McCarthy. But, since Murrow was held in such high esteem by the American people, he was apparently able to play a significant role in McCarthy's eventual downfall.There is plenty to like about this well-made film. The B&W; cinematography, full of cigarette smoke and guys in suits, lends a certain authenticity and style to the movie. Strathairn comes across as highly believable in his depiction of Murrow and the fact that George Clooney's father was a Cincinnati newsman leads me to think this was a heart felt project.But, ultimately, I must say that I have more respect than real affection for this movie. The story itself is quite straight forward and without much psychological insight into why either Murrow or McCarthy chose to act as they did. Of course, how much you like this movie will depend alot on your political leanings. Obviously, liberals, like me, will enjoy it more than conservatives.

The film tells the story of Murrow's move from radio to the new medium of television and how he used his program to report on controversial subjects. The biggest story going at the time was Senator Joseph McCarthy's overheated hunt for communists under every rock. Murrow and his producer decided to go after McCarthy on their program, often using the Senator's own words or actions against him. This caused headaches for those in charge at CBS but because of Murrow's reputation, they gave him a lot of leeway, although Murrow and his team were worried at every turn that they would lose their jobs. Eventually CBS did change Murrow's program so it was on less often as the ratings were higher for entertainment programs. This caused Murrow to make a speech years later that heavily criticized television and the direction its programmers were taking.This is a masterful movie. Well written, acted and directed.

Joseph McCarthy, and the political and corporate friction that followed.As he did with ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,"" co-writer and director George Clooney offers another wry look into the wiring of modern media.  Politics may be the main item on the agenda, but Clooney clearly relishes a chance to dig into the world of broadcasters and journalists during a goldern era of television.And a lot of the film's moves come from live television (elevator sets that rotate rather than rise and other visual slight-of-hand gags), and indeed the primary inspiration seems to consist of equal parts Sidney Lumet (both his TV work and, in the surroundings and some of the compositions, ""Network"") and the gorgeous black-and-white photography of Francis Wolff.  Clooney uses both influences to his advantage. Completely apart from the issues at hand, this is one sturdily composed, good looking film.But the main virtue of ""Good Night"" is in transmitting the spirit of Murrow, who faced down a snowballing form of bad juju with reason and clear-headed common sense.  This is a good point in time for a film that reminds viewers not to mistake dissent for disloyalty.This story could've been an epic.  Clooney could've gone into the private lives of the characters, amped up the drama and stretched the running time to two hours and change.  But instead, ""Good Night"" is a short, stark, undemanding movie that, much like Murrow, simply steps in and says what it feels it should say, then gets out of the way.",4,"""Let us not mistake dissent for disloyalty....""",1131148800,"11 5, 2005",2005,1641,"['Almost', 'novella', 'movie', 'quick', 'crisp', 'solidly', 'built', 'well-timed', 'look', 'public', 'feud', 'newsman', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'Sen.', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'political', 'corporate', 'friction', 'did', 'Confessions', 'Dangerous', 'Mind', 'co-writer', 'director', 'George', 'Clooney', 'wry', 'look', 'wiring', 'modern', 'media', 'Politics', 'may', 'be', 'main', 'item', 'agenda', 'Clooney', 'clearly', 'chance', 'dig', 'world', 'broadcasters', 'journalists', 'goldern', 'era', 'television.And', 'lot', 'film', 'moves', 'come', 'live', 'television', 'elevator', 'sets', 'rotate', 'rather', 'rise', 'other', 'visual', 'slight-of-hand', 'gags', 'indeed', 'primary', 'inspiration', 'consist', 'equal', 'parts', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'TV', 'work', 'surroundings', 'compositions', 'Network', 'gorgeous', 'black-and-white', 'photography', 'Francis', 'Wolff', 'Clooney', 'influences', 'advantage', 'Completely', 'apart', 'issues', 'hand', 'one', 'sturdily', 'composed', 'good', 'looking', 'main', 'virtue', 'Good', 'Night', 'transmitting', 'spirit', 'Murrow', 'who', 'faced', 'down', 'snowballing', 'form', 'bad', 'juju', 'reason', 'clear-headed', 'common', 'sense', 'good', 'point', 'time', 'film', 'viewers', 'not', 'mistake', 'dissent', 'disloyalty.This', 'story', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'epic', 'Clooney', 'could', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'private', 'lives', 'characters', 'amped', 'up', 'drama', 'stretched', 'running', 'time', 'two', 'hours', 'change', 'instead', 'Good', 'Night', 'short', 'stark', 'undemanding', 'movie', 'much', 'Murrow', 'simply', 'steps', 'what', 'should', 'say', 'then', 'way']",N/A

George Clooney and co. masterfully recreate the atmosphere of the McCarthy era; there is a palpable fear throughout.  He never ""dumbs down"" this important piece of history for the sake of more box office. The weaving together of archival footage with scripted drama is also tremendous. The pace does crawl at times, yet that doesn't detract from the story. Strathairn's Murrow shines brightly through the ever-present cigarette smoke, and I also enjoyed Langella's William Paley immensely. Seeing him here after recently viewing Frost/Nixon reinforces that my appreciation of his talent. I love Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson; I'd liked to have seen more of them in this movie. The Liberace footage had me laughing out loud. Its an excellent addition, and it cleverly illustrates what Murrow had to endure in order to keep his job.In the same vein with All The President's Men, this movie reminds us of the proper role journalism plays with government. Investigatory journalists, like Murrow, must ask the tough questions, even with the threat of retaliation and smear tactics. The people deserve nothing less than the light of truth.  It is no coincidence that an anti-McCarthy movie was produced by the Hollywood left in light of their disgust with or loathing of the Bush administration's tactics in the war on terror.

One called me too opinionated, saying I shouldn't talk about those things and that it was wrong to judge others. True it is wrong but then again a guy who sleeps with women purely for sex or a mother who spends her weekends drinking rather than looking after her newborn child seem like I should mention it. Good Night, and Good Luck delves into bigger issues but they're all still the same: there's wrongs in the world and we're too worried about what'll happen if we raise our voice.Back in the 50's, Senator Joe McCarthy got very anti-Communist, even going after an Air Force soldier without any evidence. A group of broadcasters with its center being Edward R. Murrow, went after McCarthy and his methods. This of course brought the retaliation that Murrow was a Communist and they're ending up being a battle of words on television over censorship and the misuse of power of those with it.In one scene, someone comes up to one of the CBS employees and provides evidence that Murrow might've been a red sympathizer at one point. It goes to show that whatever side you're on, you try to gather evidence to support it, even unjustified ones. Reminds me of the current war in Iraq where it seemed like we were given several reasons for why America was there. Clearly people in power have bigger voices rather than millions to the contrary. In my college debate class about the treatment of aboriginal peoples, one classmate said ""if we yell at the Canadian government long enough, they're bound to hear us"" to which I kind of responded to a friend ""but they have the ability to turn deaf on command"".Acting-wise there is extremely little to be upset about. George Clooney is great as Fred Friendly(I still laugh at that name) with other performances by Robert Downey Jr, Frank Langella and the under utilized Alex ""Lois Griffin"" Borstein. But special attention should be paid to David Straitharn who to me seems like a vastly underrated talent. Few actors can pull off long dialogues without being too wordy and boring and he pulls it off here.Double dips are unfortunately common lately and this film seems a given it'll be re-released with a fuller release.

641640,A10XZH78SDOI5M,B00005JOKM,C. Matthew Curtin,"[2, 7]","At the conclusion of World War II, allied leaders from the United States, Great Briton, and the Soviet Union made an agreement on how Europe would be divided up following the collapse of the axis powers. As the Soviet Union violated its agreements in refusing to withdraw from territories such as Poland, concern began to mount that the Soviet Union had ambitions to expand its influence and that it would be willing to do so by placing operatives in various positions throughout the government of the United States. This led to the Second Red Scare and an aggressive effort led by Senator Joseph McCarthy to expose Communists and their sympathizers. Good Night and Good  Luck is a period film that tells the story of famed broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow and his expos&eacute; of McCarthy's witch hunt.This is a film of both substance and style. I'll talk about the latter first. A period film works best when the story unfolds on the screen in such a way that the audience feels drawn into not just the story, but the environment, everything that makes the period what it is. An excellent design decision was made to present the film in black and white. Since this was largely a story that unfolded on the small and colorless television sets of 1950s America, what people know of the story probably is in the form of television footage. Much of the story is presented inside of the offices and studios of the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), which included not only television and radio holdings, but also recording studios, affording some wonderful mid-century Jazz to be presented by letting us peer into a recording session. The lack of color, the music, styles of dress, mannerisms, and the ever-present smoke all work together to ensure that we're drawn into the period.Casting was also quite good, with a fantastic performance from David Strathairn as Edward R. Murrow. When Strathairn delivered newscasts, we were able to see on-screen what we remember of Murrow, everything from his tone of voice to the way he held his head. When the lights dimmed and the newscast ended, we were able to see the quiet and principled determination of the man who dared to subject a powerful Senator on a mission to the scrutiny of those for whom he claimed to represent. Robert Downey Jr played Joe Wershba, Patricia Clarkson played Shirley Wershba. Murrow's friend and colleague Fred Friendly was played by George Clooney (who also directed the film, and co-wrote it with Grant Heslov). These performances were all thoroughly believable, not just as plausible characters, but as real people living and working fifty years ago.The most interesting casting choice was for the role of Joseph McCarthy. Rather than finding an actor to make a portrayal, the only visual that we had was through television, which would show actual historical footage of the Senator. One of the most powerful moments in the film is actual footage (shown live on ABC in 1954) where Joseph Welch, the U.S. Army's attorney general, rebukes McCarthy during a hearing in his famous questions, ""Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?""That the media loves this film comes as no surprise. Virtually everyone I know in broadcasting regards Murrow as a hero. Thus, I cannot help but reflect upon certain rich ironies, both in the career progression of Murrow himself and some recent actions of the media.The makings of the first critical irony can be seen in the film. It begins at a 1958 speech he made to the Radio and Television News Directors Association (RTNDA) wherein he told them that ""we are fat, comfortable, and complacent"" and that television was ""being used to detract, delude, amuse and insulate us."" That speech allows for a flashback to the events that lead up to the fateful decision to produce the ""Report on Joseph R. McCarthy"" and to cover its aftermath.By 1958, Murrow's lectures that he delivered about the demise of the industry's morals had become tiresome to those involved in the business of television and his priorities differed from those trying to win viewers. As the business of television and television news matured, no place could be found for the man that led the maturation of the profession of broadcast journalism.The second irony is in what CBS decided to air not long before the presidential election of 2004. Dan Rather (who talks of Murrow and his influence at CBS in his autobiography, The Camera Never Blinks) and his producer Mary Mapes ran a piece highly critical of President Bush and his military service. Believing the story to be true and wanting desperately to unseat the man that many on America's Left love to hate led to the airing of a story that was ultimately without foundation, based on unsubstantiated reports and false documents. Thus, under the guidance of Rather and his team that idolized Murrow, CBS had gone from helping to put an end to witch-hunts based on questionable or inconclusive evidence to doing the very same thing themselves, only to be exposed by amateurs who bothered to check facts.Good Night and Good Luck is an excellent film, demonstrating Clooney's prowess as not only an actor but as a director. Not only is the experience itself a pleasure, but it leaves viewers with plenty to consider and to discuss. I could hardly ask for more.",4,"An excellent historical film, but not documentary.",1138752000,"02 1, 2006",2006,5333,"['conclusion', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'allied', 'leaders', 'United', 'States',

It's an inside look at the decision Edward R. Murrow made to expose Senator Joseph McCarthy on Murrow's news show, See It Now. Clooney uses a black-and-white documentary style, showing what McCarthy was doing with his accusations of Communist infiltration into the government and the Army, how Murrow and his team put the factual case together against McCarthy, and what the the pressures were on Murrow by CBS, which was worried about advertisers and viewer reaction.McCarthy is shown in actual footage while Murrow is played by David Straithairn, and what a performance it is. Straithairn doesn't look a lot like Murrow, but he has the mannerisms and the voice down cold. He's such a good actor that it only takes minutes before you accept him. Most of the actors are not household names. They work exceptionally well together. In an era when ensemble acting may mean nothing more than Matt Damon, Julia Roberts and George Clooney talking over each other's lines, Clooney has in this movie shown what the term can mean. Frank Langella plays William Paley, boss of CBS, in a particularly nuanced performance. Paley's not a bad guy, but he is very aware of what causing waves can mean to CBS politically and in terms of revenue and audience. The two or three times that Murrow and Paley politely but tensely confront each other is first-rate acting by Langella and StraithairnClooney is using this disgraceful period in American history as a cautionary tale. You can either accept this or not. Much of the caution, however, seems to me to be a warning of what can happen when news morphs into entertainment and we have no more Murrows, when we can't tell a newsperson from a game show host or a hyperventilating head on cable. The movie itself, however, holds up as a tense drama of Murrow and his news team putting their reputations on the line (they know how McCarthy will attack them with public innuendo).If you go to the movie, just bear in mind that the reality of the era was far worse than what you'll be seeing.",4,We'd Better Be Careful When Journalism Just Means Entertainment,1132617600,"11 22, 2005",2005,2203,"['film', 'conservatives', 'may', 'find', 'little', 'good', 'liberals', 'may', 'find', 'nothing', 'bad', 'think', 'George', 'Clooney', 'come', 'up', 'movie', 'surprisingly', 'engrossing', 'inside', 'look', 'decision', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'made', 'expose', 'Senator', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'Murrow', 'news', 'show', 'See', 'Now', 'Clooney', 'black-and-white', 'documentary', 'style', 'showing', 'what', 'McCarthy', 'was', 'doing', 'accusations', 'Communist', 'infiltration', 'government', 'Army', 'how', 'Murrow', 'team', 'put', 'factual', 'case', 'together', 'McCarthy', 'what', 'pressures', 'were', 'Murrow', 'CBS', 'was', 'worried', 'advertisers', 'viewer', 'reaction.McCarthy', 'shown', 'actual', 'footage', 'Murrow', 'played', 'David', 'Straithairn', 'what', 'performance', 'Straithairn', ""n't"", 'look', 'lot', 'Murrow', 'mannerisms', 'voice', 'down', 'cold', 'such', 'good', 'actor', 'only', 'minutes', 'accept', 'Most', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'household', 'names', 'work', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'together', 'era', 'when', 'ensemble', 'acting', 'may', 'mean', 'nothing', 'more', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'George', 'Clooney', 'talking', 'other', 'lines', 'Clooney', 'movie', 'shown', 'what', 'term', 'can', 'mean', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'William', 'Paley', 'boss', 'CBS', 'particularly', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'Paley', 'not', 'bad', 'guy', 'very', 'aware', 'what', 'causing', 'waves', 'can', 'mean', 'CBS', 'politically', 'terms', 'revenue', 'audience', 'two', 'three', 'times', 'Murrow', 'Paley', 'politely', 'tensely', 'confront', 'other', 'first-rate', 'acting', 'Langella', 'StraithairnClooney', 'using', 'disgraceful', 'period', 'American', 'history', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'can', 'either', 'accept', 'not', 'Much', 'caution', 'however', 'be', 'warning', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'when', 'news', 'morphs', 'entertainment', 'have', 'more', 'Murrows', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'newsperson', 'game', 'show', 'host', 'hyperventilating', 'head', 'cable', 'movie', 'however', 'up', 'tense', 'drama', 'Murrow', 'news', 'team', 'putting', 'reputations', 'line', 'know', 'how', 'McCarthy', 'will', 'attack', 'public', 'innuendo', '.If', 'go', 'movie', 'just', 'bear', 'mind', 'reality', 'era', 'was', 'far', 'worse', 'what', ""'ll"", 'be', 'seeing']",N/A

His second film as director is even better than his first, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind--which was a very good debut. Everything is right about this film: the acting, direction, sets, and mood are dead on. David Strathairn gives a dynamite performance as Murrow. Too bad he had to run against Hoffman's Capote. Both of them deserved to win. Strathairn has always had the look of a 1940s-1950s straigh-arrow, and here he gets the best written role of his career. The black and white photography was a chance move for Clooney; it almost assured the movie limited box office. But it was the only real move artistically, and it enables the real footage of McCarthy to blend in seamlessly.

Murrow and his famous (or infamous) confrontation with Sen. Joseph McCarthy and his red-hunting crusade in the 1950s.  Edward R. Murrow, a CBS newsman already famous at the time for his radio broadcasts in World War II, has a weekly documentary series on television and uses that forum to examine the tactics of Joseph McCarthy.  The plot is completely predictable to anyone familiar with the events of the time, but it was still a pleasure to see it dramatized so effectively.I enjoyed the movie very much for both its story and the dramatic tension evoked in a plot I was familiar with, but even more so for its wonderful re-creation of a different time, when a married couple was forbidden to work together and everyone smoked all the time, and the clothing was fabulous.  The use of black and white photography necessitated by the incorporation of archival footage added to the atmosphere (especially with all that cigarette smoke swirling through every frame).  And in a time when movies like Old School celebrate adults acting like children, it's nice to see a movie that focuses on the pleasures and problems of being a grown up and being responsible not only for one's own actions but for how one acts in the world.And of course, it's impossible not to see the movie through the lens of current day affairs and feel the lack, which appears to be George Clooney's main goal in making this movie at this time.  He accomplishes this quite well by the simple contrast of a journalist who took his profession seriously rather than acting merely as a mouthpiece for powers that be.  It's difficult to turn on any news program from the local news to CNN immediately after watching this movie and not feel a sense of anger and frustration at what a powerful medium has been reduced to.I wonder, would I have liked this movie so much if it wasn't for the current day context?  We have a similar situation of a fear-driven government running roughshod over the Constitution and people's rights in the name of fighting an abstract ideology, and a different one of a spineless media sucking up to the powers that be rather than confronting them.  It's impossible to separate the movie from the context I viewed it in, but at this time the craft and ability of Edward R. Murrow is something worth remembering and commemorating.",5,A Re-Creation of Another Time and a Comment on Our Own Time,1152057600,"07 5, 2006",2006,2376,"['Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'story', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'famous', 'infamous', 'confrontation', 'Sen.', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'red-hunting', 'crusade', '1950s', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'CBS', 'newsman', 'already', 'famous', 'time', 'radio', 'broadcasts', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'weekly', 'documentary', 'series', 'television', 'forum', 'examine', 'tactics', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'plot', 'completely', 'predictable', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'events', 'time', 'was', 'still', 'pleasure', 'see', 'dramatized', 'so', 'effectively.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'story', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'evoked', 'plot', 'was', 'familiar', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'wonderful', 're-creation', 'different', 'time', 'when', 'married', 'couple', 'was', 'forbidden', 'work', 'together', 'everyone', 'smoked', 'time', 'clothing', 'was', 'fabulous', 'use', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'necessitated', 'incorporation', 'archival', 'footage', 'added', 'atmosphere', 'especially', 'cigarette', 'smoke', 'swirling', 'frame', 'time', 'when', 'movies', 'Old', 'School', 'celebrate', 'adults', 'acting', 'children', 'nice', 'see', 'movie', 'pleasures', 'problems', 'being', 'grown', 'up', 'being', 'responsible', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'own', 'actions', 'how', 'one', 'world.And', 'course', 'impossible', 'not', 'see', 'movie', 'lens', 'current', 'day', 'affairs', 'feel', 'lack', 'be', 'George', 'Clooney', 'main', 'goal', 'making', 'movie', 'time', 'quite', 'well', 'simple', 'contrast', 'journalist', 'who', 'took', 'profession', 'seriously', 'rather', 'acting', 'merely', 'mouthpiece', 'powers', 'be', 'difficult', 'turn', 'news', 'program', 'local', 'news', 'CNN', 'immediately', 'watching', 'movie', 'not', 'feel', 'sense', 'anger', 'frustration', 'what', 'powerful', 'medium', 'been', 'reduced', 'to.I', 'wonder', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'was', ""n't"", 'current', 'day', 'context', 'have', 'similar', 'situation', 'fear-driven', 'government', 'running', 'roughshod', 'Constitution', 'people', 'rights', 'name', 'fighting', 'abstract', 'ideology', 'different', 'one', 'spineless', 'media', 'sucking', 'up', 'powers', 'be', 'rather', 'confronting', 'impossible', 'separate', 'movie', 'context', 'viewed', 'time', 'craft', 'ability', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'something', 'worth', 'remembering', 'commemorating']",N/A

641646,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B00005JOKM,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[1, 2]","George Clooney has to be, if not the most talented guy in Hollywood, certainly the luckiest. A former Sexiest Man Alive, according to People magazine, scion of a wealthy show business clan, a tv star, a movie star, and now a successful director. His first film, Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind, on wacky tv game show host Chuck Barris's fantasies, was a sober look at a mentally disturbed man, much better than highly lauded screenwriter and director Paul Schrader's similar Auto Focus, on tv star Bob Crane's descent into pornography. But, we've all seen this before- a big star thinks he can make films, makes a first film that is lauded- think Kevin Costner, Mel Gibson, Clint Eastwood, and on and on, and then starts pumping out sheer dreck.Well, scratch that with Clooney, who also wrote the film with his producer Grant Heslov. His latest film, Good Night, And Good Luck, which tracked CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow's 1953-1954 battle with Senator Joseph McCarthy, whom he belittles backhandedly as `the Junior Senator from Wisconsin', and his own network, deserved all the accolades it got in its Academy Award nomination. Of course, its nomination was for its political stance, and the relevance to the civil and human rights abuses going on today, in the failed War On Terror, but just because it got recognized for the wrong reasons does not mean it's not a worthy film.What separates Clooney, in his first two films, from the above named actors, is that he is simply not content to tell a straightforward story. In both films he uses different filmic techniques, frames scenes in different ways- in this film letting the camera be a static fly on the wall, and generally shows that he knows what to do behind a camera, as well as in front of one. Several things show why this works. First off, Clooney and his cinematographer Robert Elswit (Magnolia) shoot the film in black and white, which always lends an `old', historic feel to a film. Secondly, he makes the audacious choice to use footage of the real Senator McCarthy and his victims, rather than using actors. In doing so, we see how truly deranged and maniacal McCarthy was. Latter day apologists try to insist he wasn't as bad as all that, and that there were real communists in the government.This is all true, but they were never a threat, merely a convenient scapegoat, and McCarthy's many false accusations and smears allowed the handful of real threats to later get off by claiming McCarthyist tactics were used against them. McCarthy falsified records, lied, claimed he had proof he never revealed, harassed people, never produced their accusers, practiced cowardice in the name of patriotism, and tried to suspend the writ of habeas corpus (ala Guantanamo Bay). The Left, especially in Academia, has much to answer for in its support of Stalin and Mao, and their regimes which murdered manifold more people than the Nazis, but the average laborer/fellow traveler merely saw The Party as a refuge from the vile practices of Big Capitalism at its worst. To equate a few rabble rousers with a plot to enslave the nation is to blur all colors between black and white, and like trying to make the case that David Duke was as great a threat to world peace as Hitler. This was why a Communist sympathizer like Alger Hiss was found guilty and sent to jail on a technical perjury, barely related to the treasonous crimes Richard Nixon accused him of, and which history has exculpated him for, yet is viewed as if he passed on atomic secrets like Julius Rosenberg. And it was in this gross conflation and addle-minded simplification that we see that the true threat to freedom was in the lying, manipulating, and fulminating madness of McCarthy, amply captured on film, and nicely left undiluted by Clooney, so that `selective editing' charges are baseless.... The film just misses greatness because Clooney makes a few errors. First, he has a pointless side story about a married couple (Robert Downey, Jr. and Patricia Clarkson) at CBS that violate the company rule against married employees, then he has a subplot about a man, Don Hollenbeck (Ray Wise), McCarthy drives to suicide (done in Martin Ritt's Woody Allen starring film The Front, with Zero Mostel's character), and finally the film's soundtrack is a bit weak, with a jazz score that seems inapt to the gravity of the situation. But, these are all minor demerits. The use of classic 1950s commercials and footage more than makes up for those weaknesses, and really gives a claustrophobic feel, at times, that only heightens the drama, the outcome of which, is known. Yet, this fact does not lessen the intensity because Clooney gives a great performance, and Strathairn, as Murrow, is simply brilliant. It is a testament to his brilliance (mostly unseen in small, independent films, such as those by John Sayles) that this great performance is almost routine in his canon.",4,Clooney has

Or, rewritten in a more obvious form, ""We had to destroy your freedom in order to preserve it"".  This is the essence of the various House and Senate witch-hunts for communists in the 1950s.  One has to wonder why the politicians were so afraid unless they really thought that Communism was a stronger government system than a constitutional republic, but perhaps that's a debate for another place.  This film is more about journalism, and the duty of the media in times of national crisis.Edward R. Murrow was one of the old-school journalists we see very little of these days.  An news anchor at CBS in the 1950s and 60s, and before that a reporter in London during the Blitz, he believed that the person reporting the news had a solemn duty to his audience.  That duty was to report facts accurately, and to protect the constitution and its emphasis on freedom, including freedom of the press.  When he attacked certain people, he would be accused of having an agenda (political, social), but the attackers invariably missed the point - his choice of targets were those who would (often illegally) abuse their power to advance their own agendas.  Thus, William Randolf Hurst was a target, but this film is about Murrow calling out Senator Joseph P. McCarthy and his Senate Committee investigating Communists in the government.MacCarthy was the (Republican) Junior Senator for Wisconsin, not a position that would put him high in the hierarchy of the Senate, or in a position of influence with the Democratic president Truman.  However, he carved himself out an empire in the Cold War hysteria of the 50s trying to root out anyone with any connection, however peripheral, to a Communist (whether home-grown or associated with the Soviet Union or China didn't matter).  This activity was largely unquestioned by most people, until it became clear that the political views of an ex-wife, or a father or sibling, could destroy your own career and livelihood just as surely as if you were accused of being at a meeting yourself.  In the height of the hysteria, any accusation of impropriety would destroy your career, and McCarthy would wave around papers and envelopes without any content and try to scare confessions out of people with no proof, and no opportunity to answer the charges.  Even if the goal was noble (about which Murrow ventures no opinion), it was the trampling of the constitutional rights that evoked his crusade against McCarthy.Ultimately, this is a back-room film, where we see the full hierarchy of CBS news in action, putting together stories for Murrow's weekly programs (one a hard-news magazine, the other his Person-to-Person show where he interviews celebrities like Liberace).  The Senate Hearings hang over the newsroom like a pall of smoke (as opposed to the actual pall of smoke from the cigarettes the Murrow and others smoked constantly).  Filmed in black-and-white, with ample use of archival footage (mostly of McCarthy but also Democrats like RFK, at the Senate hearings and elsewhere), the film charts the contest of wills between the ranting, self-important McCarthy and the cool fact-dispensing Murrow.  George Clooney directs and also plays producer Fred Friendly, and he brings an authenticity to the proceedings that only first-hand knowledge can provide: his father was a news-show producer, and young George spent lots of time down at the station.It may seem strange that a newsroom duel can be riveting entertainment, and indeed there is far more ""plot"" here than in an average movie.  While too complex a topic to fully explain all that is going on, it really isn't necessary to understand it all, since the main conflict is crystal clear.  It's a fascinating account and if it has a modern-day resonance, well so much the better (I am reminded of Fox's cowardly decision to fire Bill Maher after the 9/11 attacks, a decision that the braver 1950s CBS did not make with Murrow).  I think Clooney (a well-known Democrat and social activist) has made as balanced a film as it is possible to make, but undoubtedly people are going to bring their own politics to the film.  I would hope that each viewer would keep the following in mind: Murrow never attacked McCarthy's politics, nor the witch-hunt in general, instead he simply exposed the anti-constitutional tactics that the witch-hunters used.",4,the witch-hunter hunters,1348444800,"09 24, 2012",2012,4503,"['treatment', 'was', 'success', 'patient', 'died', 'ironic', 'expression', 'ran', 'head', 'couple', 'times', 'when', 'watching', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'rewritten', 'more', 'obvious', 'form', 'had', 'destroy', 'freedom', 'order', 'preserve', 'essence', 'various', 'House', 'Senate', 'witch-hunts', 'communists', '1950s', 'One', 'wonder', 'why', 'politicians', 'were', 'so', 'afraid', 'really', 'thought', 'Communism', 'was', 'stronger', 'government', 'system', 'constitutional', 'republic', 'perhaps', 'debate', 'place', 'film', 'more', 'journalism', 'duty', 'media', 'times', 'national', 'crisis.Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'was', 'one', 'old-school', 'journalists', 'see', 'very', 'little', 'days', 'news', 'anchor', 'CBS', '1950s', '60s', 'reporter', 'London', 'Blitz', 'believed', 'person', 'reporting', 'news', 'had', 'solemn', 'duty', 'audience', 'duty', 'was', 'report', 'facts', 'accurately', 'protect', 'constitution', 'emphasis', 'freedom', 'including', 'freedom', 'press', 'When', 'attacked', 'certain', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'accused', 'having', 'agenda', 'political', 'social', 'attackers', 'invariably', 'missed', 'point', 'choice', 'targets', 'were', 'who', 'would', 'often', 'illegally', 'abuse', 'power', 'advance', 'own', 'agendas', 'Thus', 'William', 'Randolf', 'Hurst', 'was', 'target', 'film', 'Murrow', 'calling', 'out', 'Senator', 'Joseph', 'P.', 'McCarthy', 'Senate', 'Committee', 'investigating', 'Communists', 'government.MacCarthy', 'was', 'Republican', 'Junior', 'Senator', 'Wisconsin', 'not', 'position', 'would', 'put', 'high', 'hierarchy', 'Senate', 'position', 'influence', 'Democratic', 'president', 'Truman', 'However', 'carved', 'out', 'empire', 'Cold', 'War', 'hysteria', '50s', 'trying', 'root', 'out', 'anyone', 'connection', 'however', 'peripheral', 'Communist', 'home-grown', 'associated', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'China', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'activity', 'was', 'largely', 'unquestioned', 'most', 'people', 'became', 'clear', 'political', 'views', 'ex-wife', 'father', 'sibling', 'could', 'destroy', 'own', 'career', 'livelihood', 'just', 'as', 'surely', 'were', 'accused', 'being', 'meeting', 'height', 'hysteria', 'accusation', 'impropriety', 'would', 'destroy', 'career', 'McCarthy', 'would', 'wave', 'papers', 'envelopes', 'content', 'try', 'scare', 'confessions', 'people', 'proof', 'opportunity', 'answer', 'charges', 'Even', 'goal', 'was', 'noble', 'Murrow', 'ventures', 'opinion', 'was', 'trampling', 'constitutional', 'rights', 'evoked', 'crusade', 'McCarthy.Ultimately', 'back-room', 'film', 'where', 'see', 'full', 'hierarchy', 'CBS', 'news', 'action', 'putting', 'together', 'stories', 'Murrow', 'weekly', 'programs', 'one', 'hard-news', 'magazine', 'other', 'Person-to-Person', 'show', 'where', 'celebrities', 'Liberace', 'Senate', 'Hearings', 'hang', 'newsroom', 'pall', 'smoke', 'opposed', 'actual', 'pall', 'smoke', 'cigarettes', 'Murrow', 'others', 'smoked', 'constantly', 'Filmed', 'black-and-white', 'ample', 'use', 'archival', 'footage', 'mostly', 'McCarthy', 'also', 'Democrats', 'RFK', 'Senate', 'hearings', 'elsewhere', 'film', 'contest', 'wills', 'ranting', 'self-important', 'McCarthy', 'cool', 'fact-dispensing', 'Murrow', 'George', 'Clooney', 'directs', 'also', 'producer', 'Fred', 'Friendly', 'authenticity', 'proceedings', 'only', 'first-hand', 'knowledge', 'can', 'provide', 'father', 'was', 'news-show', 'producer', 'young', 'George', 'spent', 'lots', 'time', 'down', 'station.It', 'may', 'seem', 'strange', 'newsroom', 'duel', 'can', 'be', 'riveting', 'entertainment', 'indeed', 'far', 'more', 'plot', 'here', 'average', 'movie', 'too', 'complex', 'topic', 'fully', 'explain', 'going', 'really', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'understand', 'main', 'conflict', 'crystal', 'clear', 'fascinating', 'account', 'modern-day', 'resonance', 'well', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'am', 'reminded', 'Fox', 'cowardly', 'decision', 'fire', 'Bill', 'Maher', '9/11', 'attacks', 'decision', 'braver', '1950s', 'CBS', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'Murrow', 'think', 'Clooney', 'well-known', 'Democrat', 'social', 'activist', 'made', 'balanced', 'film', 'possible', 'make', 'undoubtedly', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'bring', 'own', 'politics', 'film', 'would', 'hope', 'viewer', 'would', 'keep', 'following', 'mind', 'Murrow', 'never', 'attacked', 'McCarthy', 'politics', 'witch-hunt', 'general', 'instead', 'simply', 'exposed', 'anti-constitutional', 'tactics', 'witch-hunters', 'used']",N/A
641648,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B00005JOKM,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[4, 8]","Actor/Director George Clooney pays tribute to truth and decency amid distrust and uncertainty in the Communist witchhunts with his recreation of its greatest hero, the newsman of newsmen, Edward R. Murrow, in Good Night, and Good Luck.In the early 1950's, the Communist scare and the subsequent subversion of citizens' rights was at its apex with blacklists and rampant accusations resulting in ruined lives and careers.  Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) was the grand master of the news airwaves in the infantile medium of television.  With his show's director, Fred Friendly (George Clooney) and his production team, he picks one obscure news item regarding an Air Force serviceman who is dismissed due to unspecified charges.  Murrow and CBS essentially take on the US Air Force amid this climate of suspicion and presumed guilt.  Later, Murrow's team takes on Senator Joseph McCarthy by making critical comments of the senator's own words and contradictions.  McCarthy retaliates with accusations of Murrow's supposed association with un-American groups just as the parent network, CBS, reels under sponsorship pressure and the unpredictable whims of network president William Paley (Frank Langella).  As Murrow and his own staff come under tense scrutiny by McCarthy and even CBS, public reaction and the response of the print media come to the forefront.Nothing can compare to the words that were written and spoken with such conviction and honesty as those uttered by Murrow.  The title of the movie is a direct quote that Murrow employed to sign off each week at the close of his interview shows.  The filmmakers (including director Clooney and writers Clooney and Grant Heslov) were wise to let the text stand on its own.  They also benefit from good performances from a cast headed by Strathairn (L.A. Confidential, A League of Their Own), a journeyman actor who has finally found a core role to call his own, and he makes the most of it.  He gets the mannerisms and cadence down quite convincingly, and while Strathairn may not look exactly like Murrow, he has the persona nailed.  Frank Langella (Dave) is excellent as the mercurial Paley whose support of Murrow was tenuous at best.  Ray Wise (Twin Peaks) registers in what could have been a more defined role as a doomed newsman whose guilt by association triggers some life changing events. Patricia Clarkson (The Station Agent) and Robert Downey Jr. (Chaplin) as secretly married staffers, Joe and Shirley, round out the cast.  Ironically, perhaps the best performance can be attributed to McCarthy himself as newsreels offer a fascinating, perverse glance at the infamous politician whose flamboyance and dogged theatrics doomed the careers of many government officials and film or television actors.  The duel between Murrow and McCarthy seems like two heavyweights going at it verbally in the public arena.The cinematography by Robert Elswit (Magnolia) is crisp and starkly lit in black and white to evoke the past.  The production design and costumes are consistent with the period.  Just the sight of newsmen typing on old style typewriters or production assistants carrying around film reels instead of videotape or discs is amusing.  The editing by Stephen Mirrione (Traffic, 21 Grams) is tight and well paced.  At times the studio broadcasts of a female blues singer bridges various sequences in theme and mood. The broadcast of a live network news program is staged with realism and with the frenzy and excitement that only live television could bring.  One wonders what TV veterans like Sidney Lumet or Robert Altman could have brought to the table.Murrow's show was kind of a precursor to the current granddaddy of all prime time news shows, 60 Minutes.  It was interesting to see that his was not a perfect career having to mix fluffy showbiz interviews with such personalities as Liberace on his Person-to-Person show with legitimate news reports.  At 93 minutes, the film surprisingly seems a bit short.  You almost feel like this is a big budget episode of the famous You Are There reenactment shows.  The story ends almost abruptly as it begins being bookended by a formal event honoring Murrow in 1958.A couple of things don't quite work in the film.  The characters of Joe and Shirley must come to terms with the network's policy forbidding marriage among its coworkers, but this subplot doesn't significantly serve to move the story forward.  Clooney shows a workman-like approach to directing the film but it just doesn't grab you as emotionally as you would like.  You sit there entranced by the history but are never fully given to the pathos of its characters.  Instead, the film becomes almost a quasi-documentary bereft of much feeling.As previous films have dealt with the Red Scare and blacklists, this film compares favorably with The Front and the great television movie Fear on Trial.  Although the Soviet Union was a major threat to the United States during the Cold War, the accusatory enemy from within was perhaps as great a menace.  The implications and parallels to today's political climate and the role television has in shaping perception are clearly the point Clooney and gang are trying to make.  Murrow's formal speech, which begins and ends the film's story, is itself a prophetic and sobering commentary and indictment of the possibilities of television and foreshadows the future with amazing prescience.  It shows that one man made a difference.  Such is the testament to a heroic reporter whose integrity this film manages to capture, albeit in a brief history lesson.",4,"America on Trial in GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK",1129248000,"10 14,

The last film marked George Clooney's sophomore directorial effort (the first being Confessions of a Dangerous Mind) and chronicled legendary newsman Edward R. Murrow's (played in the film by Strathairn) public battle against Senator Joseph McCarthy who was waging his own war on what he perceived as a Communist threat in the United States during the 1950s. His tactics were highly suspect and a lot of innocent people lost their jobs and, in some cases, their lives because of McCarthy's actions.Clooney and Grant Heslov's screenplay is trimmed of any narrative fat and makes clear and concise points. They may be accused of lionizing Murrow but so what? In this day and age when Ryan Seacrest is given as much attention as any of the major network newscasters something is definitely wrong. If anything, Good Night is a lament for the lack of journalists with integrity.Clooney's film recalls the heady days when television journalists, like Murrow, were highly regarded as objective investigators of the truth and known for their unimpeachable integrity. Murrow was considered by many to be the epitome of this ideal. David Strathairn turns in another solid performance, portraying the journalist as a brave man not afraid to stand up for his beliefs. For those of us who have been watching Strathairn in his early days, appearing in John Sayles films, this is nothing new but his turn in Good Night and his subsequent Academy Award nomination gives this great character actor much deserved wider exposure.Good Night, and Good Luck is relevant to our current political climate as President Bush and his cronies, like McCarthy, trample over our civil liberties and exert pressure on the mainstream American press (who roll over and take it), creating a climate of fear. Now, more than ever, we need someone like Murrow who is willing to stand up to these bullies. If this film tells us anything it is that our media must be ever vigilant and be willing to criticize our government when it is wrong.There is audio commentary with George Clooney and his screenwriting partner (and the film's producer) Grant Heslov. Interspersed between factoids is their dry, self-deprecating humour that makes this relaxed track quite an entertaining listen. These guys clearly did their homework as they speak very knowledgeably about Murrow and the times he lived in. They also are able discuss various filmmaking techniques they employed and what other films and filmmakers that influenced them.""Good Night, and Good Luck Companion Piece"" examines how Clooney and Heslov consulted with Friendly and Murrow's families to make sure that they got the facts right and portrayed them accurately.

Harkening back to an age when those who delivered the evening news were true reporters instead of image-obsessed actors reading mindlessly off a screen, this film tells in shades of metaphor the events behind the courageous crusade of CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow to expose the cruel campaign of ruinous muckraking and induced paranoia then Senator Joseph McCarthy, Republican, Wisconsin, was waging beneath the guise of keeping America safe from covert Communist intrusion. Murrow risked everything, his reputation, livelihood, his very liberty, to reveal the actions of the man who unwillingly gave his name to a form of witch hunt: ""McCarthyism."" Murrow was a true hero of freedom and a journalistic icon. His dedication to the craft of investigative journalism was rare for his time and is sadly all-but unknown in this day and age. His was an era when television news was listened to instead of watched, and his insights into the drear possibility of the future of television and society, spoken right at the start of the picture, have come grimly true in the 2000's.

Joseph McCarthy abused his position of power when he claimed many U.S. citizens were Communist Party members. By instilling fear he was able to cripple people's lives with uncorroborated hearsay evidence. Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) decided to report the known facts of McCarthy's tactics on his show with the assistance of his right-hand man, Fred Friendly (George Clooney). With Murrow's strong following he was able change the course of history.The film was produced in black and white and with impeccable acting and props I felt I was living through the events and they unfolded. Of course it must have been much more extraordinary back then; but, having not grown up in that time this is the closest I will ever come to understanding the impact of those events.You do not need to be a history buff to enjoy this movie. A little light reading would not hurt though if you are not familiar with Murrow and McCarthy; I found it useful to have my computer at hand to lookup up some lesser known people I was curios about (but didn't need to know to have the film make sense).David Strathairn did an excellent job portraying Murrow right down to the infamous Camel cigarette always in hand. The additional cast of George Clooney, Patricia Clarkson, Jeff Daniels, Robert Downey Jr., and Frank Langella all showed their talent on the screen. I was particularly impressed with Ray Wise who played Don Hollenbeck - his superb (although small) role with stay with me for a long time.9 out of 10 - Rated PG - Watch this one for the historical importance and amazing film making.Dain BinderDain's Movie Reviews",5,Good Night And Good Luck Movie Review,1252713600,"09 12, 2009",2009,2022,"['Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'early', 'years', 'television', 'journalism', 'principles', 'specifically', 'on-air', 'clash', '1950', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'CBS', 'Senator', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'Wisconsin', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'including', 'McCarthy', 'archival', 'footage', 'film', 'alive', 'intense', 'emotion', 'depicting', 'historical', 'See', 'Now', 'journalism', 'integrity.Sen', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'abused', 'position', 'power', 'when', 'claimed', 'many', 'U.S.', 'citizens', 'were', 'Communist', 'Party', 'members', 'instilling', 'fear', 'was', 'able', 'cripple', 'people', 'lives', 'uncorroborated', 'hearsay', 'evidence', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'decided', 'report', 'known', 'facts', 'McCarthy', 'tactics', 'show', 'assistance', 'right-hand', 'man', 'Fred', 'Friendly', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Murrow', 'strong', 'following', 'was', 'able', 'change', 'course', 'history.The', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'black', 'white', 'impeccable', 'acting', 'props', 'felt', 'was', 'living', 'events', 'unfolded', 'course', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'extraordinary', 'back', 'then', 'having', 'not', 'grown', 'up', 'time', 'closest', 'will', 'ever', 'come', 'understanding', 'impact', 'events.You', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'history', 'buff', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'little', 'light', 'reading', 'would', 'not', 'hurt', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'Murrow', 'McCarthy', 'found', 'useful', 'have', 'computer', 'hand', 'lookup', 'up', 'lesser', 'known', 'people', 'was', 'curios', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'know', 'have', 'film', 'make', 'sense', '.David', 'Strathairn', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'Murrow', 'right', 'down', 'infamous', 'Camel', 'cigarette', 'always', 'hand', 'additional', 'cast', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'showed', 'talent', 'screen', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'who', 'played', 'Don', 'Hollenbeck', 'superb', 'small', 'role', 'stay', 'long', 'time.9', '10', 'Rated', 'PG', 'Watch', 'one', 'historical', 'importance', 'amazing', 'film', 'making.Dain', 'BinderDain', 'Movie', 'Reviews']",N/A

Clendenin,"[5, 6]","George Clooney wrote, directed, and starred in this historical docudrama about the 1953 hostilities between television commentator Edward Murrow of CBS and ""the junior senator from Wisconsin,"" Joseph McCarthy. The latter, of course, accused Murrow and many others of communism. Murrow, for his part, stood up to McCarthy's muckraking. More broadly, even at its dawn Murrow openly worried that television would become a medium that would ""distract, delude, amuse, and insulate us,"" rather than teach, illuminate or inspire. He also decried the conflicts of interest between television's corporate advertisers, the government's efforts to spin propaganda, the military, journalistic independence, and the viewing public. We must never ""confuse dissent with disloyalty,"" Murrow insisted. Can news ever be neutral? Should it even try to be? Does not most every perspective ""censor"" the news with its own commitments and predispositions? Given the radical polarizations of our contemporary political context, due in part to the role of media, this is a film that deserves viewing and discussion of the many questions it raises. At several junctures in the film Murrow insists that television viewers and the body politic get what they deserve: ""our history will be what we make it.""

A dying World War Two soldier grabs a young person and commands, ""Earn this."" All those heroic World War Two era American soldiers who died defeating fascism and making our lives possible -- we owe it to them, ""Saving Private Ryan"" insists, to appreciate their sacrifice, and make the most of our lives.I left ""Good Night and Good Luck"" feeling chastised. George Clooney took actual film footage and transcripts from another era and made them speak directly to us today. ""Habeus corpus."" ""National security."" ""Civil Liberties."" ""Terror."" All these words ring with great resonance today.Clooney draws obvious parallels between the 1950s Cold War on Communism and the current War on Terror.US Senator Joe McCarthy plays himself, in old film footage. He comes across as so deeply sleazy, oily, and unhinged that the viewer feels superior -- how could those simple-minded folk from the 1950s have taken this character seriously? His protege, a sort of ""Mini Me,"" Roy Cohn, also shows up in film footage, and is as grotesque as and even more patently evil than McCarthy.One pauses and considers how film clips of George Bush will look to future audiences.David Strathairn plays journalist Edward R. Murrow, as he, anchoring ""See It Now,"" his show on CBS-TV, takes time out from smirky and sexually suggestive questions aimed at celebrity interviews with the likes of Liberace, to expose Joe McCarthy for what he is -- a lying demagogue and fear monger.Strathairn gives one of the single most powerful performances I've ever seen in a movie. I surrendered all my attention and heeded Straithairn / Murrow's every word and gesture.Strathairn achieves great stature here. He is in the same class as Gary Cooper in ""High Noon"" and Gregory Peck in ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" His performance is Oscar-worthy, even in a year of fine performances.Director Clooney films in black and white, to mirror the televised images he interweaves with his dramatizations. Clooney's black and white is elegant as an Ansel Adams' photo. If you like gazing at classy vintage clothing and suave behavior photographed in beautiful images, this film can satisfy you on that level alone.The film's lead characters smoke almost all the time (except George Clooney as Fred Friendly; how did Friendly, a non-smoker in real life, ever survive in that atmosphere? Viewers might nearly become ill just staring at all that smoking). The smoke is beautifully photographed; efforts to deglamorize smoking take several steps backward in this movie.It's ironic; Murrow crusaded for worthy causes, but by promoting smoking through his own example (studies show that children, exposed to screen images of smoking, are more likely to adopt the habit), Murrow did terrible harm.Reactions to this film often split between two extremes. One extreme insists that Communism was not a threat to America, and that McCarthy was the greatest threat imaginable.Another extreme insists, just as shrilly, that Communism was a terrible threat, and McCarthy was not such a bad guy.Both extremes are wrong, of course. Communists Stalin and Mao murdered many more people than the fascists, Hitler and Mussolini. The souls of the victims of Kolyma and Tuol Sleng weigh as much as the souls of the victims of Auschwitz and Dachau, though, of course, for a variety of reasons, many people who are hyper-aware of Auschwitz and Dachau have never heard of Kolyma and Tuol Sleng, or would as soon deny their horror.And Communism was a threat to America, and Communist spies were, as well. As was McCarthyism.Extremists on both sides did not do the search for truth any good.These extreme reactions are mirrored today. Some insist that Jihad is no threat to America, and that George Bush and the War on Terror are frauds.Others insist that George Bush must not be questioned, and that Jihad is a threat.Of course, again, both extremes are wrong. Jihad is a threat, and George Bush must be questioned.",5,Our Heroic Ancestors Adjure Us to Live Up to Their Example,1142380800,"03 15, 2006",2006,3992,"['great', 'scene', 'end', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'dying', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'soldier', 'grabs', 'young', 'person', 'commands', 'Earn', 'heroic', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'era', 'American', 'soldiers', 'who', 'died', 'defeating', 'fascism', 'making', 'lives', 'possible', 'owe', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'appreciate', 'sacrifice', 'make', 'most', 'lives.I', 'left', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'feeling', 'chastised', 'George', 'Clooney', 'took', 'actual', 'film', 'footage', 'transcripts', 'era', 'made', 'speak', 'directly', 'today', 'Habeus', 'corpus', 'National', 'security', 'Civil', 'Liberties', 'Terror', 'words', 'ring', 'great', 'resonance', 'today.Clooney', 'obvious', 'parallels', '1950s', 'Cold', 'War', 'Communism', 'current', 'War', 'Terror.US', 'Senator', 'Joe', 'McCarthy', 'old', 'film', 'footage', 'across', 'so', 'deeply', 'sleazy', 'oily', 'unhinged', 'viewer', 'superior', 'how', 'could', 'simple-minded', 'folk', '1950s', 'have', 'taken', 'character', 'seriously', 'protege', 'sort', 'Mini', 'Me', 'Roy', 'Cohn', 'also', 'up', 'film', 'footage', 'as', 'grotesque', 'even', 'more', 'patently', 'evil', 'McCarthy.One', 'pauses', 'considers', 'how', 'film', 'clips', 'George', 'Bush', 'will', 'look', 'future', 'audiences.David', 'Strathairn', 'plays', 'journalist', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'anchoring', 'See', 'Now', 'show', 'CBS-TV', 'time', 'out', 'smirky', 'sexually', 'suggestive', 'questions', 'aimed', 'celebrity', 'interviews', 'likes', 'Liberace', 'expose', 'Joe', 'McCarthy', 'what', 'lying', 'demagogue', 'fear', 'monger.Strathairn', 'one', 'single', 'most', 'powerful', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'surrendered', 'attention', 'heeded', 'Straithairn', '/', 'Murrow', 'word', 'gesture.Strathairn', 'achieves', 'great', 'stature', 'here', 'same', 'class', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'High', 'Noon', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'performance', 'Oscar-worthy', 'even', 'year', 'fine', 'performances.Director', 'Clooney', 'films', 'black', 'white', 'mirror', 'televised', 'images', 'dramatizations', 'Clooney', 'black', 'white', 'elegant', 'Ansel', 'Adams', 'photo', 'like', 'gazing', 'classy', 'vintage', 'clothing', 'suave', 'behavior', 'photographed', 'beautiful', 'images', 'film', 'can', 'satisfy', 'level', 'alone.The', 'film', 'lead', 'characters', 'smoke', 'almost', 'time', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Fred', 'Friendly', 'how', 'did', 'Friendly', 'non-smoker', 'real', 'life', 'ever', 'survive', 'atmosphere', 'Viewers', 'might', 'nearly', 'become', 'ill', 'just', 'staring', 'smoking', 'smoke', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'efforts', 'deglamorize', 'smoking', 'take', 'several', 'steps', 'backward', 'movie.It', 'ironic', 'Murrow', 'crusaded', 'worthy', 'causes', 'promoting', 'smoking', 'own', 'example', 'studies', 'show', 'children', 'exposed', 'screen', 'images', 'smoking', 'are', 'more', 'likely', 'adopt', 'habit', 'Murrow', 'did', 'terrible', 'harm.Reactions', 'film', 'often', 'two', 'extremes', 'One', 'extreme', 'Communism', 'was', 'not', 'threat', 'America', 'McCarthy', 'was', 'greatest', 'threat', 'imaginable.Another', 'extreme', 'just', 'shrilly', 'Communism', 'was', 'terrible', 'threat', 'McCarthy', 'was', 'not', 'such', 'bad', 'guy.Both', 'extremes', 'are', 'wrong', 'course', 'Communists', 'Stalin', 'Mao', 'murdered', 'many', 'more', 'people', 'fascists', 'Hitler', 'Mussolini', 'souls', 'victims', 'Kolyma', 'Tuol', 'Sleng', 'weigh', 'as', 'much', 'souls', 'victims', 'Auschwitz', 'Dachau', 'course', 'variety', 'reasons', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'hyper-aware', 'Auschwitz', 'Dachau', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'Kolyma', 'Tuol', 'Sleng', 'would', 'as', 'soon', 'deny', 'horror.And', 'Communism', 'was', 'threat', 'America', 'Communist', 'spies', 'were', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'McCarthyism.Extremists', 'sides', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'search', 'truth', 'good.These', 'extreme', 'reactions', 'are', 'mirrored', 'today', 'insist', 'Jihad', 'threat', 'America', 'George', 'Bush', 'War', 'Terror', 'are', 'frauds.Others', 'insist', 'George', 'Bush', 'must', 'not', 'be', 'questioned', 'Jihad', 'threat.Of', 'course', 'again', 'extremes', 'are', 'wrong', 'Jihad', 'threat', 'George', 'Bush', 'must', 'be', 'questioned']",N/A

A lot of award nominations and it was actually rated PG (doesn't happen very often!).  However, this movie doesn't have a lot of thrills or moments of suspense and it doesn't have much of a climax either.  In fact, there seems to be little conflict as well.  I felt like I learned some things about Sen. McCarthy and the fear he put in Americans with targeting people unjustly as Communists.  However, I didn't seem to learn anything on Edward Murrow.  David Strathairn, who I loved in Dolores Claiborne, doesn't seem believable to me.  He has moments where he seems angry at McCarthy and what is going on, but for the most part, he kind of feels indifferent to it all.  Like, ho hum, I guess I'll take on McCarthy, might lose my job, whatever.  It didn't feel like the David versus Goliath like it could have been.  Many characters seemed kind of useless to the story as well.  I didn't really understand why the black woman jazz singer was shown over and over.  There just wasn't enough cohesiveness to the story and I felt like a lot of things were glossed over and too much attention was spent on small, insignificant details.  On the positive note, I felt like the film was shot very well.  The black and white went really well with the whole era and it made me feel like I was back in that time.  The problem still is that the movie had trouble holding my attention as it went through its sluggish pace (my wife fell asleep 20 minutes in).  I expected more, but I should know better - if it was nominated for an Oscar, then it probably is not worth seeing.  But hey, it was free.  No harm, no foul.

This is certainly a well made film though the best parts are probably the use of archival footage.  Maybe Clooney should have made a documentary instead.  That said, there's something a little disingenuous about this exercise.  I can understand Clooney's desire to condemn McCarthyism but does he have to elevate Murrow to martyr status, which in this case being relegated to a Sunday afternoon chat show instead of weekly primetime status?

Granted, there is no context for McCarthy's (and many others') fear of communism during the middle of the Twentieth Century.  Communism was born in Russia in 1917, but did not expand much until near the middle of the century.  Then at the end of WWII, the Soviets took over eastern Europe, and in 1949, the communists took over China.  Next came Korea, where we had just been involved in a bloody war, costing 53,000 American lives, to save part of the Korean Peninsula from communism.  By 1953, any reasonable person who did not wish to live under the slavery of totalitarianism had good reason to fear the lightning-fast expansion of communism.Senator McCarthy went overboard in his anti-communist zeal, accusing people without sufficient proof, but it is hard to not to sympathize with his general attitude.  Frankly, McCarthy does not come across in this film as being any worse than many of today's politician/demogogues.Edward R. Murrow and CBS did not jump on McCarthy until public opinion was already starting to turn against him.

George Clooney is a talented director and David Strathairn brilliantly portrays the morally flawed Joe McCarty.  Yes, there were actual Communists and Communist sympathizers in our government.  This is beyond debate.  Alger Hiss was a Communist spy along with Harry Dexter White.  Franklin D. Roosevelt even felt compelled to drop his own vice-president, Henry Wallace, from the ticket in 1944 because of the latter's infatuation with Communism.  Joe McCarty was mostly right about the problem.  Something had to be done.  Still, this did not justify his slanderous behavior and bullying.  The man was a political thug who threatened our civil liberties.  He is directly responsible for creating a climate of fear.  While watching ""Good Night, and Good Luck,"" I kept thinking how much good McCarthy could have accomplished had he been meticulously careful with his accusations.  In many respects, the Wisconsin senator inadvertently became one of the best friends the Communists ever had.I normally do not share the political views of Director Clooney.

How are you today?""","[1, 1]","George Clooney's nifty dissection of TV journalism in the McCarthy era works on a number of levels, and almost every one of them is a success.  There's the workplace comedy, complete with office politics and the cool couple everyone loves (with Patricia Clarkson and Robert Downey Jr. playing them, who wouldn't?).  There's the political bite of the McCarthy era and the peril for those who worked in television and the entertainment era during the blacklist. (No ""Way We Were"" soft-peddling here, folks.) There's the built-in nostalgia of the silky black-and-white cinematography, rooms filled with cigarette smoke, and men in suits and hats.  There's even a musical flow to the film that also works comedically, with the luscious Diane Reeves in an adjacent studio purring her way through a variety of jazz standards that comment on the film's action in satirical ways. (""TV Is The Thing This Year"" is a complete gas.) The crispness of the writing, the spot-on casting (including an amazing turn by David Straithairn as the film's anchor, but lots of juicy bits by Clooney himself, Jeff Daniels, and an especially haunting cameo by Ray Wise as a man who goes down smiling) and the pleasure the film evokes in a viewer may even lull one into not really noticing how incisive and brilliant Clooney's analysis of politics, entertainment and news really is.  But watch out for those moments where Straithairn looks right at the camera and delivers some of his monologues--they're tiny masterpieces of intensity.  One could argue that the film is a little claustrophobic (there are almost no scenes outside), and some may find the film's restraint (compared to the go-for-broke satire of ""Network"") too tidy.  Others will say what the critics and others did: in the early part of this century, when the country marched lock-step into an ill-advised war without bothering to question its leaders and their manipulations, this film is a chilling reminder of how much we can lose if we're not vigilant.  This one is right behind ""Brokeback Mountain"" on most year-end lists (including my own) for the best film of 2005; it may very well wind up like ""Brokeback"" as one of the best of the decade.--certainly one of the most important and emblematic films of its time.",4,So enjoyable you might not even notice its brilliance,1206316800,"03 24, 2008",2008,2259,"['George', 'Clooney', 'nifty', 'dissection', 'TV', 'journalism', 'McCarthy', 'era', 'number', 'levels', 'almost', 'one', 'success', 'workplace', 'comedy', 'complete', 'office', 'politics', 'cool', 'couple', 'everyone', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'playing', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'political', 'bite', 'McCarthy', 'era', 'peril', 'who', 'worked', 'television', 'entertainment', 'era', 'blacklist', 'No', 'Were', 'soft-peddling', 'here', 'folks', 'built-in', 'nostalgia', 'silky', 'black-and-white', 'cinematography', 'rooms', 'filled', 'cigarette', 'smoke', 'men', 'suits', 'hats', 'even', 'musical', 'flow', 'film', 'also', 'comedically', 'luscious', 'Diane', 'Reeves', 'adjacent', 'studio', 'purring', 'way', 'variety', 'jazz', 'standards', 'comment', 'film', 'action', 'satirical', 'ways', 'TV', 'Thing', 'Year', 'complete', 'gas', 'crispness', 'writing', 'spot-on', 'casting', 'including', 'amazing', 'turn', 'David', 'Straithairn', 'film', 'anchor', 'lots', 'juicy', 'bits', 'Clooney', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'especially', 'haunting', 'cameo', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'man', 'who', 'down', 'smiling', 'pleasure', 'film', 'evokes', 'viewer', 'may', 'even', 'lull', 'one', 'not', 'really', 'noticing', 'how', 'incisive', 'brilliant', 'Clooney', 'analysis', 'politics', 'entertainment', 'news', 'really', 'watch', 'out', 'moments', 'where', 'Straithairn', 'right', 'camera', 'monologues', ""'re"", 'tiny', 'masterpieces', 'intensity', 'One', 'could', 'argue', 'film', 'little', 'claustrophobic', 'are', 'almost', 'scenes', 'outside', 'may', 'find', 'film', 'restraint', 'compared', 'go-for-broke', 'satire', 'Network', 'too', 'tidy', 'Others', 'will', 'say', 'what', 'critics', 'others', 'did', 'early', 'part', 'century', 'when', 'country', 'marched', 'lock-step', 'ill-advised', 'war', 'bothering', 'question', 'leaders', 'manipulations', 'film', 'chilling', 'reminder', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'lose', ""'re"", 'not', 'vigilant', 'one', 'right', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'most', 'year-end', 'lists', 'including', 'own', 'best', 'film', '2005', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'wind', 'up', 'Brokeback', 'one', 'best', 'decade.', 'certainly', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'emblematic', 'films', 'time']",N/A

641663,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00005JOKM,Dennis Littrell,"[1, 1]","I won't join the chorus of accolades for George Clooney for his direction of this movie, but I will give him credit for making it.  The way the press has been pushed around (and especially let itself be pushed around) during the George W. Bush years is a disgrace, and it is good that Clooney is here to remind us of a journalist who had the guts to go after a power-hungry demagog whose agenda included finding traitors among those who disagreed with him.  Sound familiar?So, just as Arthur Miller's celebrated play The Crucible was timely in that it symbolically chastised those who would conduct witch hunts in the name of patriotism, Clooney's film is timely in that it reminds the Fourth Estate of its responsibility, a responsibility sorely neglected in the buildup to the war in Iraq.As far as the film itself goes, a black and white fusion of documentary footage and an acted-out story line, it was good, but not great.  David Strathairn, playing Edward R. Murrow, certainly had Murrow's voice, cadences and mannerisms down pat.  However, because there would be a viewer's eye conflict with the actor's appearance and the way the real Edward R. Murrow looked, we were unfortunately not shown footage of Murrow himself.  Which is a shame.  Even though I was a child at the time, seeing Murrow's dark, penetrating presence on the old Muntz TV was indelible.  He had a way of talking straight to the viewer and doing so in a manner that was clear, fair and to the point.  Strathairn does a good job of reenacting that presence.And it was good to see some footage of the demagoging junior Republican senator from Minnesota, Joseph McCarthy, in all his drunken, bullying vainglory.  And I was fascinated to see President Eisenhower giving a spirited speech.  Indeed the film managed to atmospherically recall the era of the early fifties when TV was all in black and white and everybody smoked to excess, especially Murrow.  (But softening accusations of receiving Big Tobacco money, Clooney was wise to include an old TV commercial for Kent cigarettes in which the hyping of their new ""safe"" filters sounds cruelly ironic today.)Frank Langella was excellent as Murrow's careful, yet supportive boss, media legend William Paley.  And Clooney himself played a nicely understated Fred Friendly.  I have to say however that the film lacked a certain tension and that the focus was not as clearly defined as it might have been.  A film without much tension and with a fuzzy focus can be boring (as some viewers have had the temerity to point out).  Yet would it have been better to have simplified the issues for the sake of an easier understanding and accessibility for the average viewer?  I don't know, but if I had been Clooney I would have more directly tied the issue of the responsibility and independence of a free press (the central issue in the film) in with what is happening today and what has happened in recent years.Almost stopping the show by herself was jazz vocalist Dianne Reeves singing some of the standards of the era, including ""How High the Moon,"" ""One for My Baby,"" etc., and the very catchy and ironic, ""TV is the Thing This Year.""  Her easy but intense concentration, her beautiful voice, and her exquisite timing were for me one of the highlights of the movie.Bottom line: After seeing this on a return flight from Hawaii I can now say that not EVERY film that I have seen on an airline has been unwatchable.  However flawed, Good Night, and Good Luck is definitely worth the time and effort, especially for those who care about the history of broadcast journalism and governmental attempts to control the media.",4,"Lacks somewhat in focus and tension, but still worthwhile",1139443200,"02 9, 2006",2006,3639,"['wo', ""n't"", 'join', 'chorus', 'accolades', 'George', 'Clooney', 'direction', 'movie', 'will', 'give', 'credit', 'making', 'way', 'press', 'been', 'pushed', 'especially', 'let', 'be', 'pushed', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'years', 'disgrace', 'good', 'Clooney', 'here', 'remind', 'journalist', 'who', 'had', 'guts', 'go', 'power-hungry', 'demagog', 'agenda', 'included', 'finding', 'traitors', 'who', 'disagreed', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'So', 'just', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'celebrated', 'play', 'Crucible', 'was', 'timely', 'symbolically', 'chastised', 'who', 'would', 'conduct', 'witch', 'hunts', 'name', 'patriotism', 'Clooney', 'film', 'timely', 'Fourth', 'Estate', 'responsibility', 'responsibility', 'sorely', 'neglected', 'buildup', 'war', 'Iraq.As', 'far', 'film', 'black', 'white', 'fusion', 'documentary', 'footage', 'acted-out', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'playing', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'certainly', 'had', 'Murrow', 'voice', 'cadences', 'mannerisms', 'down', 'pat', 'However', 'would', 'be', 'viewer', 'eye', 'conflict', 'actor', 'appearance', 'way', 'real', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'looked', 'were', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'shown', 'footage', 'Murrow', 'Which', 'shame', 'Even', 'was', 'child', 'time', 'seeing', 'Murrow', 'dark', 'penetrating', 'presence', 'old', 'Muntz', 'TV', 'was', 'indelible', 'had', 'way', 'talking', 'straight', 'viewer', 'doing', 'so', 'manner', 'was', 'clear', 'fair', 'point', 'Strathairn', 'good', 'job', 'reenacting', 'presence.And', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'footage', 'demagoging', 'junior', 'Republican', 'senator', 'Minnesota', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'drunken', 'bullying', 'vainglory', 'was', 'fascinated', 'see', 'President', 'Eisenhower', 'giving', 'spirited', 'speech', 'Indeed', 'film', 'managed', 'atmospherically', 'recall', 'era', 'early', 'fifties', 'when', 'TV', 'was', 'black', 'white', 'everybody', 'smoked', 'excess', 'especially', 'Murrow', 'softening', 'accusations', 'receiving', 'Big', 'Tobacco', 'money', 'Clooney', 'was', 'wise', 'include', 'old', 'TV', 'commercial', 'Kent', 'cigarettes', 'hyping', 'new', 'safe', 'filters', 'cruelly', 'ironic', 'today', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'was', 'excellent', 'Murrow', 'careful', 'yet', 'supportive', 'boss', 'media', 'legend', 'William', 'Paley', 'Clooney', 'played', 'nicely', 'understated', 'Fred', 'Friendly', 'have', 'say', 'however', 'film', 'lacked', 'certain', 'tension', 'focus', 'was', 'not', 'clearly', 'defined', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'much', 'tension', 'fuzzy', 'focus', 'can', 'be', 'boring', 'viewers', 'have', 'had', 'temerity', 'point', 'out', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'have', 'simplified', 'issues', 'sake', 'easier', 'understanding', 'accessibility', 'average', 'viewer', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'had', 'been', 'Clooney', 'would', 'have', 'more', 'directly', 'tied', 'issue', 'responsibility', 'independence', 'free', 'press', 'central', 'issue', 'film', 'what', 'happening', 'today', 'happened', 'recent', 'years.Almost', 'stopping', 'show', 'herself', 'was', 'jazz', 'vocalist', 'Dianne', 'Reeves', 'singing', 'standards', 'era', 'including', 'How', 'High', 'Moon', 'One', 'My', 'Baby', 'etc.', 'very', 'catchy', 'ironic', 'TV', 'Thing', 'Year', 'easy', 'intense', 'concentration', 'beautiful', 'voice', 'exquisite', 'timing', 'were', 'one', 'highlights', 'movie.Bottom', 'line', 'seeing', 'return', 'flight', 'Hawaii', 'can', 'now', 'say', 'not', 'EVERY', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'airline', 'been', 'unwatchable', 'However', 'flawed', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'definitely', 'time', 'effort', 'especially', 'who', 'care', 'history', 'broadcast', 'journalism', 'governmental', 'attempts', 'control', 'media']",N/A

But the portrayal of murrow was barely two dimensional - I saw an actor playing a part (doing it well, I must say), but Strathairn's Murrow didn't seem like a real person. Lots of far-away looks, sitting and smoking, lost in thought - I asked myself if Murrow was that stiff?I think Clooney's Fred Friendly was more alive and animated and showed me that he is more than a ""movie star"" - he may yet become a well-respected actor (and director).The dialogue was sharp, well written and delivered with perfect timing. And that's a good thing because there are no car chases, explosions and sex scenes to hold the average movie-goers' attention (no offense).All in all, this is decent film and one that deserves praise for the courage it took to make it.

McCarthyism is one of those topics that no one can go wrong with... right?Right. Or, probably not, but this film does a fine job. It tells a fascinating story of newsmen behind the scenes, risking everything (or at least a lot) to speak their minds about the popular but wholly awful Sen. Joseph McCarthy. The only problem I really have here is that I was expecting something a whole lot more than ""a fine job.""Good Night and Good Luck presents its story faithfully. It's about newsmen from the 50s, and so we have (black and white) footage of newsmen. Newsmen talking before going on the air, about what they're going to report on. Newsmen on the air. Newsmen after going on the air, discussing what they had been discussing. Reading their newspaper reviews. That sort of thing. It all feels appropriate--this is the story, after all--but after awhile, I started to ask myself: why a movie? Movies are storytelling devices, sure, but one of the things that really differentiates movies is their... well... cinematic quality. They excel at showing interesting things visually.... And, there's just not a whole lot to see in Good Night and Good Luck.Yes, the acting is wonderful, but this could be a fixed camera affair, like an old teleplay when they didn't know yet that not being on stage gave one a world of options. I'm not saying this is a bad movie. It's really good. But I think that this story doesn't make for the most engaging of cinematic experiences, because in the end it comes across as a story of a bunch of newsmen, sitting around talking about (and delivering) the news. Because that is what it is.In the end, you'll probably really enjoy this movie.

There are even some real TV commercials from the 1950sin the movie.What an amazing history lesson.It talks so much about basic American Rights and Freedoms. The right to a fair trial.

641670,A9CKMSQ6ZEWLB,B00005JOKM,D. Rodgers,"[0, 0]","Good Night, and Good Luck is an honest and upright look at broadcast politics during the 40's and 50's, when Senator Joseph McCarthy was on a witch hunt to uncover Communist sympathizers living in the U.S. The film, which was directed, co-written and starring George Clooney, is a nice look back at old school filmmaking, from decades long since past, and is shot in gorgeous black and white looks great. I think more films these days should be made in black and white, because they force you to concentrate on the story and characters, and allow you to not get distracted from anything else.What I meant by ""old school filmmaking"" was that Good Night, and Good Luck isn't buried beneath a lot of modern day filmmaking techniques; including overindulgent and quick paced editing, or fast, sudden camera movements, or a heavy handed booming musical score. Every thing in Good Night, and Good Luck is underplayed, and aimed at accomplishing a sense of realism, without having to ""amp"" anything up, or going dramatically over-the-top. That's what I what I meant by old school filmmaking, and this is a nice change of pace from the norm, because it's rare to find a film with a relaxed pace, and requires you to think for yourself, and at the same time the film isn't overly long, finishing up in about 90 minutes.At the heart of the picture is Edward R. Murrow, a CBS news journalist, played to perfection by David Strathairn. Murrow standed up to Sen. McCarthy (which is shown using entirely old film stock footage) and his tactics when no body else would, for fear that they too would be seen as a Communist. Murrow is represented as a noble hero, seeking out the truth, and not gossip or rumors; a reporter who believes in integrity and honesty; a real American.This is George Clooney's second film to direct, but he easily convinced me that he'd been directing movies for far longer. He's a man that can not only act, but write, produce and direct as well, now that takes talent. Good Night, and Good Luck was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Director, Actor, Screenplay, Cinematography and Art Direction. Which is pretty much saying that Good Night, and Good Luck is well made, well directed, acted, written and also looks mighty fine as well, and that pretty much sums it up for me.However, the film certainly isn't perfect, and in fact does suffer from a few things. First, the subplot of the married couple, played by Robert Downey, Jr. and Patricia Clarkson felt pointless and tagged on, just some extra ""padding"" to increase the already too short running time. The film also lacks strong character development, or arch; the characters never go through any change from the very beginning to the very end. And the film may have also been too fact driven, as if Clooney didn't want to ""Hollywoodize"" any part of the film, even if it means creating a more interesting, or riveting plot, or characters. I found these few things to weaken the overall feel of the film, but not enough to really discourage me from recommending it, but I must say that out of all the films I saw last year I could name at least five other films I saw that could have and probably should have been nominated for Best Picture over this one. Good Night and Good Luck succeeds in the really important areas; it has a really good message that's backed up by some solid performances and is presented with strict attention to the facts.",3,"""If we're gonna go down, we might as well go down swinging.""",1143331200,"03 26, 2006",2006,3436,"['Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'honest', 'upright', 'look', 'broadcast', 'politics', '40', '50', 'when', 'Senator', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'was', 'witch', 'hunt', 'uncover', 'Communist', 'sympathizers', 'living', 'U.S', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'co-written', 'starring', 'George', 'Clooney', 'nice', 'look', 'back', 'old', 'school', 'filmmaking', 'decades', 'long', 'past', 'shot', 'gorgeous', 'black', 'white', 'looks', 'great', 'think', 'more', 'films', 'days', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'black', 'white', 'force', 'concentrate', 'story', 'characters', 'allow', 'not', 'get', 'distracted', 'anything', 'meant', 'old', 'school', 'filmmaking', 'was', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', ""n't"", 'buried', 'beneath', 'lot', 'modern', 'day', 'filmmaking', 'techniques', 'including', 'overindulgent', 'quick', 'paced', 'editing', 'fast', 'sudden', 'camera', 'movements', 'heavy', 'handed', 'booming', 'musical', 'score', 'Every', 'thing', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'underplayed', 'aimed', 'accomplishing', 'sense', 'realism', 'having', 'amp', 'anything', 'up', 'going', 'dramatically', 'over-the-top', 'what', 'what', 'meant', 'old', 'school', 'filmmaking', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'norm', 'rare', 'find', 'film', 'relaxed', 'pace', 'think', 'same', 'time', 'film', ""n't"", 'overly', 'long', 'finishing', 'up', 'about', '90', 'minutes.At', 'heart', 'picture', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'CBS', 'news', 'journalist', 'played', 'perfection', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'Murrow', 'standed', 'up', 'Sen.', 'McCarthy', 'shown', 'using', 'entirely', 'old', 'film', 'stock', 'footage', 'tactics', 'when', 'body', 'else', 'would', 'fear', 'too', 'would', 'be', 'seen', 'Communist', 'Murrow', 'represented', 'noble', 'hero', 'seeking', 'out', 'truth', 'not', 'gossip', 'rumors', 'reporter', 'who', 'integrity', 'honesty', 'real', 'American.This', 'George', 'Clooney', 'second', 'film', 'direct', 'easily', 'convinced', ""'d"", 'been', 'directing', 'movies', 'far', 'longer', 'man', 'can', 'not', 'only', 'act', 'write', 'produce', 'direct', 'as', 'well', 'now', 'talent', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'was', 'nominated', 'six', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Director', 'Actor', 'Screenplay', 'Cinematography', 'Art', 'Direction', 'Which', 'pretty', 'much', 'saying', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'well', 'made', 'well', 'directed', 'acted', 'written', 'also', 'mighty', 'fine', 'well', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'up', 'me.However', 'film', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'fact', 'suffer', 'few', 'things', 'First', 'subplot', 'married', 'couple', 'played', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'felt', 'pointless', 'tagged', 'just', 'extra', 'padding', 'increase', 'already', 'too', 'short', 'running', 'time', 'film', 'also', 'strong', 'character', 'development', 'arch', 'characters', 'never', 'go', 'change', 'very', 'beginning', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'too', 'fact', 'driven', 'Clooney', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'Hollywoodize', 'part', 'film', 'even', 'creating', 'more', 'interesting', 'riveting', 'plot', 'characters', 'found', 'few', 'things', 'weaken', 'overall', 'feel', 'film', 'not', 'enough', 'really', 'discourage', 'recommending', 'must', 'say', 'films', 'saw', 'last', 'year', 'could', 'name', 'least', 'five', 'other', 'films', 'saw', 'could', 'have', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'one', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'really', 'important', 'areas', 'really', 'good', 'message', 'backed', 'up', 'solid', 'performances', 'presented', 'strict', 'attention', 'facts']",N/A

I am not the kind of person who demands explosions or screaming fits or hot onscreen sex every ten minutes, but dramatic tension, competent storytelling and film editing is essential in any film of any genre --- and as much as I whole-heartedly agree with what George Clooney is trying to do here, his movie is, sad to say, sorely lacking in those 3 critical areas.This movie is hopelessly monochromatic, both literally and figuratively. Way too many closeups of the eternally dour-faced David Straitharn who plays Edward Murrow, that now-extinct breed of journalist with testicles intact who faces down and speaks truth to power. Way too many pointless cutaways to some random anonymous female jazz singer. About the only attractive and humorous scenes are those with Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson who play a clandestinely married couple working at CBS...otherwise everyone else onscreen looks like they haven't had a decent bowel movement in years.It's really a shame, because the sociopolitical climate portrayed in this film bears many striking similarities to our own, making it an extremely timely and relevant film with tremendous educational potential.

641674,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JOKM,Ed Uyeshima,"[0, 3]","David Strathairn's uncanny impersonation of legendary journalist Edward R. Murrow is the centerpiece of George Clooney's sophomore venture as a feature film director. Granted it comes across a bit like a stylized civics lesson on free speech and responsible journalism, the movie is also sharply focused and extremely evocative in recreating the claustrophobic atmosphere of TV journalism in the 1950's. It's obvious that Clooney did his homework as you see all the details of the production from the smoke-filled sets to the extensive use of historic video from that period, whether it's Murrow's ""Face to Face"" program or the Congressional hearings identifying possible Communists.Shot in crisp black and white by Robert Elswit, the story co-written by Clooney and Grant Heslov is driven by the infamous Senator Joseph McCarthy's anti-Communist witch-hunts when in 1953, McCarthy bullies the US Air Force into discharging one of its young officers based on a vague allegation that the man's father was a leftist. This outrages the otherwise reserved Murrow who, with the assistance of producer Fred Friendly, uses their CBS News program ""See It Now"" to expose McCarthy's egregious act. Of course, this brings down the heat of the brass at the network, in particular, president William Paley, but Murrow and Friendly are allowed to continue, even allowing McCarthy to respond to the allegations.Clooney smartly uses archived footage of McCarthy rather than cast an actor to play the ruthless senator, but he has assembled a top-notch cast to fill out the remaining roles. Frank Langella brings his trademark authoritative malevolence to the intimidating Paley but with hints of humanity that make him seem more vulnerable. Clooney himself takes on the rather pedestrian role of Friendly with his usual panache. Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson easily play secretly married CBS News co-workers, but their subplot is dispensable. Jeff Daniels makes a welcome return as a mid-level CBS executive trying to convince Murrow to pursue the relatively safe target of Joe Kennedy.There are in-studio performances by jazz singer Dianne Reeves that act like a chorus to the story, but as expert as her singing is, these are the only false steps the film makes. The film's most intriguing performance actually comes from Ray Wise as CBS anchor Don Hollenbeck, displaying a frozen smile and fragile psyche as a powerful New York Post columnist regularly accuses him of being a Communist sympathizer. The movie, however, belongs to Straithairn in an elliptical performance that shows Murrow's evolving position between drags of his constant cigarettes and to Clooney who has directed a piercing history lesson that does not ambitiously portend any present-day relevance. Yet, the message that we should not confuse dissent with disloyalty rings just as true today.",4,Clooney Proves to Be an Observant and Urgent Filmmaker Recreating Murrow-McCarthy Showdown,1131840000,"11 13, 2005",2005,2858,"['David', 'Strathairn', 'uncanny', 'impersonation', 'legendary', 'journalist', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'centerpiece', 'George', 'Clooney', 'sophomore', 'venture', 'feature', 'film', 'director', 'Granted', 'bit', 'stylized', 'civics', 'lesson', 'free', 'speech', 'responsible', 'journalism', 'movie', 'also', 'sharply', 'focused', 'extremely', 'evocative', 'recreating', 'claustrophobic', 'atmosphere', 'TV', 'journalism', '1950', 'obvious', 'Clooney', 'did', 'homework', 'see', 'details', 'production', 'smoke-filled', 'sets', 'extensive', 'use', 'historic', 'video', 'period', 'Murrow', 'Face', 'Face', 'program', 'Congressional', 'hearings', 'identifying', 'possible', 'Communists.Shot', 'crisp', 'black', 'white', 'Robert', 'Elswit', 'story', 'co-written', 'Clooney', 'Grant', 'Heslov', 'driven', 'infamous', 'Senator', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'anti-Communist', 'witch-hunts', 'when', '1953', 'McCarthy', 'US', 'Air', 'Force', 'discharging', 'one', 'young', 'officers', 'based', 'vague', 'allegation', 'man', 'father', 'was', 'leftist', 'otherwise', 'reserved', 'Murrow', 'who', 'assistance', 'producer', 'Fred', 'Friendly', 'CBS', 'News', 'program', 'See', 'Now', 'expose', 'McCarthy', 'egregious', 'act', 'course', 'down', 'heat', 'brass', 'network', 'particular', 'president', 'William', 'Paley', 'Murrow', 'Friendly', 'are', 'allowed', 'continue', 'even', 'allowing', 'McCarthy', 'respond', 'allegations.Clooney', 'smartly', 'archived', 'footage', 'McCarthy', 'rather', 'cast', 'actor', 'play', 'ruthless', 'senator', 'assembled', 'top-notch', 'cast', 'fill', 'out', 'remaining', 'roles', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'trademark', 'authoritative', 'malevolence', 'intimidating', 'Paley', 'hints', 'humanity', 'make', 'seem', 'more', 'vulnerable', 'Clooney', 'rather', 'pedestrian', 'role', 'Friendly', 'usual', 'panache', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'easily', 'play', 'secretly', 'married', 'CBS', 'News', 'co-workers', 'subplot', 'dispensable', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'welcome', 'return', 'mid-level', 'CBS', 'executive', 'trying', 'convince', 'Murrow', 'pursue', 'relatively', 'safe', 'target', 'Joe', 'Kennedy.There', 'are', 'in-studio', 'performances', 'jazz', 'singer', 'Dianne', 'act', 'chorus', 'story', 'as', 'expert', 'singing', 'are', 'only', 'false', 'steps', 'film', 'film', 'most', 'intriguing', 'performance', 'actually', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'CBS', 'anchor', 'Don', 'Hollenbeck', 'displaying', 'frozen', 'smile', 'fragile', 'psyche', 'powerful', 'New', 'York', 'Post', 'columnist', 'regularly', 'being', 'Communist', 'sympathizer', 'movie', 'however', 'Straithairn', 'elliptical', 'performance', 'Murrow', 'evolving', 'position', 'drags', 'constant', 'cigarettes', 'Clooney', 'who', 'directed', 'piercing', 'history', 'lesson', 'not', 'ambitiously', 'portend', 'present-day', 'relevance', 'message', 'should', 'not', 'confuse', 'dissent', 'disloyalty', 'rings', 'just', 'true', 'today']",N/A

Nilges ""Author, 'Build Your Own .Ne...","[0, 2]","This well-crafted black and white look at McCarthyism and Ed Murrow uses blocks of silence, and of velvet black, to set the scene, and from this emerges once again a voice I heard as a kid, which even as a kid I knew was the voice of a crazy man.This was McCarthy's self-indulgent Irish baritone, speaking with false horror of things about which the junior Senator knew nothing, jumping from one keyword, one sound byte, to another in a free association that eventually overreached...but left a permanent mark on the sloppy, Chomsky type 0 way in which real Americans think.The lowest level of language (Chomsky 0 in that political figure's technical work in linguistics) is one of nouns only and permits a dreamlike free association. In Ed Murrow's time, service in the ""Lincoln Brigade"" triggers ""must be a Soviet spy"" in a series of transitions.Of course, as is shown in this movie, real men (and, following some droll remarks by big George Clooney, I will go ahead and frigging reclaim the language that was high-jacked by *haute* bourgeois feminism in the 1980s) think, and in Murrow's case spoke on the air in a moral grammar, with actual subordinate clauses. This allowed them to actually REMEMBER that the ACLU was never on any list, and to realize what was being done to a code clerk at State because she was black, and because the Department of State was pre-trashed by Nixon (as it continues to be the whipping boy of the chicken hawks today).George Clooney, who is almost as good looking as me, is a great American because he injects this movie into an America that has been moronized back to McCarthyism by 20 years of false promises and true miseries.

641676,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00005JOKM,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 1]","Always nice to be so late to a party...one can be so lazy and free. Really, GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK can only be reviewed in such a fashion as this. Since I loved watching Murrow as a kid when it was all new, I absolutely loved this pioneering you-are-there film.The cast is well explained, and I like most of the reviews here. So I will make like I mostly make:1. This film has some groundbreaking cinematography, though at times I felt like I was watching the alien autopsy. Clooney should have done better than that overall, because he does better than that in the film itself. The camera moves as if it were a nervous observer, but I think Clooney did a little too much moving, less stillness than this topic deserves.2. The little office romance is a bit of a stupid distraction; too much was going on for this film to zero in and out of that relationship. I recall my father, at the time of McCarthy's insanity, was so scared. He thought the kids would start getting the 3rd degree next; I was always waiting for McCarthy's men to come to our house. That is the reality for at least some of us, and we were Republicans! And Clooney decides to waste the audience's time with Robert Downey's gosh darned romance? THEY TURN OUT TO BE LONG MARRIED ANYWAY!!3. It is this unwise move that detracts from Strathairn's performance. Jeez, this is THE BIGGEST THING for poor David Strathairn, character-actor-extraordinaire...and like the witch hunt, he nearly got back-seated by the damned romance.4. Everything else in this film is really flawless, blameless. The detail, the sets, everything truly brought back childhood memories because what child doesn't imagine what goes on behind the scenes?Last but not least in details: I don't generally find fault with black and white movies that are very new. That's how they are made, period. However, GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK really should have been done in color. I think Murrow would have liked that. Show the film-in-film as black and white...show the action in color.Let me phrase the B&W; argument as carefully as possible: such films are always beautiful. I could never argue that. What I do argue is a B&W; film is NOT going to add nostalgia or genuineness. I was there, watching Murrow with my parents...we HATED B&W.; No one wanted to be seeing it forever: we awaited the day when all would be color.I do not remember anything in B&W.; Do you? Why then should we insist on it for movies of this kind? Woody Allen was right to do ZELIG that way; it was a mockumentary/Movie Tone News type piece. When ""we are there"", it should be in color, as it of course really was. Then if you have a TV going or something, let THAT be B&W.;There. My eloquent argument to Follywood and its weird ideology.The rampant cigarette smoking here also brings back a strong memory and message: FREEDOM. I recall when it was easy to smoke anywhere, as long as one was not rude. You didn't blow smoke where it wasn't appreciated. You stubbed out your ciggie for more important things. In fact, it is interesting to note that Murrow didn't make that hot an impression early on, because I recall my parents saying a man like that shouldn't address an audience and smoke simultaneously. I think they were right. Later, Murrow was hallmarked as The Man With the Cigarette and the Attitude.This film is NOT leftist politprop. Anyone who says so has not really seen this film. Hell, Murrow stole his trademark sign-off line, which is the title of this film, from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, who signed off with those words the first time she addressed her people by radio.GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK is a very good depiction of what really happened. I wish there were more of it; it isn't all here and it's far too short (89 minutes running time, read 80 minutes plus credits). Too much office romance about characters who ultimately mean nothing. On any road, Murrow would've been proud as hell with this offering, and so was I.This film may bore a bit after a few watchings, so think twice about collecting it. It will be in my collection. Definitely watch and appreciate it--in fifty years' time, this will be one of the all-time great 100 films.",3,"Yellow is Better Than Red, So Keep Looking at My Cigarette, Keep Looking at My Cigarette",1273363200,"05 9, 2010",2010,4171,"['Always', 'nice', 'be', 'so', 'late', 'party', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'lazy', 'free', 'Really', 'GOOD', 'NIGHT', 'AND', 'GOOD', 'LUCK', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'reviewed', 'such', 'fashion', 'loved', 'watching', 'Murrow', 'kid', 'when', 'was', 'new', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'pioneering', 'you-are-there', 'film.The', 'cast', 'well', 'explained', 'like', 'most', 'reviews', 'here', 'will', 'make', 'mostly', 'make:1', 'film', 'groundbreaking', 'cinematography', 'though', 'times', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'alien', 'autopsy', 'Clooney', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'overall', 'better', 'film', 'camera', 'were', 'nervous', 'observer', 'think', 'Clooney', 'did', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'moving', 'less', 'stillness', 'topic', 'deserves.2', 'little', 'office', 'romance', 'bit', 'stupid', 'distraction', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'going', 'film', 'zero', 'relationship', 'recall', 'father', 'time', 'McCarthy', 'insanity', 'was', 'so', 'scared', 'thought', 'kids', 'would', 'start', 'getting', '3rd', 'degree', 'next', 'was', 'always', 'waiting', 'McCarthy', 'men', 'come', 'house', 'reality', 'least', 'were', 'Republicans', 'Clooney', 'waste', 'audience', 'time', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'gosh', 'darned', 'romance', 'THEY', 'TURN', 'OUT', 'TO', 'BE', 'LONG', 'MARRIED', 'ANYWAY', '3', 'unwise', 'move', 'Strathairn', 'performance', 'Jeez', 'BIGGEST', 'THING', 'poor', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'character-actor-extraordinaire', 'witch', 'hunt', 'nearly', 'got', 'back-seated', 'damned', 'romance.4', 'Everything', 'else', 'film', 'really', 'flawless', 'blameless', 'detail', 'sets', 'everything', 'truly', 'brought', 'back', 'childhood', 'memories', 'what', 'child', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'what', 'scenes', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'details', 'do', ""n't"", 'generally', 'find', 'fault', 'black', 'white', 'movies', 'are', 'very', 'new', 'how', 'are', 'made', 'period', 'However', 'GOOD', 'NIGHT', 'AND', 'GOOD', 'LUCK', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'color', 'think', 'Murrow', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'Show', 'film-in-film', 'black', 'white', 'show', 'action', 'color.Let', 'B', 'W', 'argument', 'as', 'carefully', 'possible', 'such', 'films', 'are', 'always', 'beautiful', 'could', 'never', 'argue', 'What', 'do', 'B', 'W', 'film', 'NOT', 'going', 'add', 'nostalgia', 'genuineness', 'was', 'there', 'watching', 'Murrow', 'parents', 'HATED', 'B', 'W', 'one', 'wanted', 'be', 'seeing', 'forever', 'awaited', 'day', 'when', 'would', 'be', 'color.I', 'do', 'not', 'remember', 'anything', 'B', 'W', 'Do', 'Why', 'then', 'should', 'insist', 'movies', 'kind', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'was', 'right', 'do', 'ZELIG', 'way', 'was', 'mockumentary/Movie', 'Tone', 'News', 'type', 'piece', 'When', 'are', 'there', 'should', 'be', 'color', 'course', 'really', 'was', 'Then', 'have', 'TV', 'going', 'something', 'let', 'THAT', 'be', 'B', 'W.', 'eloquent', 'argument', 'Follywood', 'weird', 'ideology.The', 'rampant', 'cigarette', 'smoking', 'here', 'also', 'back', 'strong', 'memory', 'message', 'FREEDOM', 'recall', 'when', 'was', 'easy', 'smoke', 'anywhere', 'as', 'long', 'one', 'was', 'not', 'rude', 'did', ""n't"", 'blow', 'smoke', 'where', 'was', ""n't"", 'appreciated', 'stubbed', 'out', 'ciggie', 'more', 'important', 'things', 'fact', 'interesting', 'note', 'Murrow', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'impression', 'early', 'recall', 'parents', 'saying', 'man', 'should', ""n't"", 'address', 'audience', 'smoke', 'simultaneously', 'think', 'were', 'right', 'Later', 'Murrow', 'was', 'hallmarked', 'Man', 'Cigarette', 'Attitude.This', 'film', 'NOT', 'leftist', 'politprop', 'Anyone', 'who', 'so', 'not', 'really', 'seen', 'film', 'Hell', 'Murrow', 'stole', 'trademark', 'sign-off', 'line', 'title', 'film', 'Majesty', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'who', 'signed', 'off', 'words', 'first', 'time', 'addressed', 'people', 'radio.GOOD', 'NIGHT', 'AND', 'GOOD', 'LUCK', 'very', 'good', 'depiction', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'wish', 'were', 'more', ""n't"", 'here', 'far', 'too', 'short', '89', 'minutes', 'running', 'time', 'read', '80', 'minutes', 'credits', 'Too', 'much', 'office', 'romance', 'characters', 'who', 'ultimately', 'mean', 'nothing', 'road', 'Murrow', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'proud', 'hell', 'offering', 'so', 'was', 'I.This', 'film', 'may', 'bore', 'bit', 'few', 'watchings', 'so', 'think', 'twice', 'collecting', 'will', 'be', 'collection', 'Definitely', 'watch', 'appreciate', 'fifty', 'years', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'all-time', 'great', '100', 'films']",N/A

641678,A1655SGPPUUCRP,B00005JOKM,Emily Todd,"[2, 4]","With ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" George Clooney (yes, you read that correctly, GEORGE CLOONEY is the writer and director of this overwhelmingly-positively-reviewed film) delivers a riveting account of a crucial chapter in 20th Century American history and, in the process, firmly establishes himself as a major force behind the camera as well. The crisply paced, tautly scripted docudrama recounts the events of the mid-1950s leading up to acclaimed CBS journalist Edward R. Murrow's (David Strathairn) decision to stand up against fiery Senator Joseph McCarthy, who was out to rid the country of communism. McCarthy's seemingly reckless behavior, in which he condemned individuals without giving them a fair trial, angered Murrow and his producer Fried Friendly (Clooney) into action. The resulting few episodes of Murrow's show, ""See it Now,"" found Murrow on a personal, patriotic crusade to challenge McCarthy and rid America of his callous persecution.Set almost entirely inside the smoke-filled, pressurized newsrooms at CBS, Clooney's assured picture moves at a breakneck pace. Cinematographer Robert Elswit miraculously recreates the black-and-white look of that era, giving the film an added air of legitimacy. And while Clooney and co-screenwriter/producer Grant Heslov wisely chose to use stock footage of McCarthy instead of finding an actor to fill his shoes, they couldn't have found a better Murrow than in Strathairn, who delivers his lines with heroic conviction. Clooney's stellar ensemble cast also includes Ray Wise, Patricia Clarkson, Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Daniels, and Frank Langella.As his live television production of ""Fail-Safe"" showed, George Clooney has an interest in recreating drama with a sharp, fifties/sixties-style sensibility. He also has a desire to express his very distinct--and markedly liberal--political views. This revisiting of the 1954 television confrontation between CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow, still venerated as an icon of activist journalism, and Red-baiting Senator Joe McCarthy gives him the opportunity to fulfill both ambitions simultaneously. Happily, ""Good Night, and Good Luck""--the title repeats Murrow's signature sign-off--isn't just a stirring paean to courageous reporting that challenges the powerful when they mangle the truth or abuse their position (the message that Clooney certainly intends to communicate to the contemporary media); it's also a crackling good story, told with style and economy.The approach that the director and co-writer and producer Grant Heslov bring to the tale is tight and focused; not much happens beyond the confines of the CBS broadcasting studio and a bar where the newsmen hang out. (The rare exceptions are the office of William S. Paley, the head of the network; the halls of Congress; and the apartment of two staffers who are secretly married--against company policy.) The portrayal of Murrow is equally limited; we learn nothing of his personal life. It's his dedication to getting out the truth at all cost--he knows full well that McCarthy will use his customary tactics of personal vilification through allegation of communist sympathies against him--that dominates. The script, drawn largely from the record in recreating the broadcasts but naturally more speculative when it comes to off-record conversation, portrays him as a man of unquestioned anti-communist attitudes whose opposition to McCarthy involved disagreement not with his goals but with his methods. (It precedes the assault on McCarthy himself with a treatment of Murrow's investigation of the case of Milo Radulovich, who was dismissed from the Air Force because of his family's supposed communist ties--a program that symbolized the effects of the senator's tactics on innocent individuals.) It also shows him as a strategist aware that he had to choose his battles carefully (thus his refusal to be more open in his support of anchorman Don Hollenback, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of his who was attacked by McCarthy partisans in the media) and circumspect in his dealings with Paley. Murrow doesn't come across as a plaster saint here; his uncertainty and concern for the safety of himself and those who work with him is subtly demonstrated as well as his passion for honesty and principles. And the pain he feels at having to compromise himself by doing entertainment programming like ""Person to Person"" to insure continuing network support for his serious ""See It Now"" program, even when its controversial character threatened to sour advertisers, is also shown (sometimes in humorouds tones, as when he has to conduct an interview with Liberace).In painting this portrait of Murrow Clooney is fortunate in having David Strathairn on board. A journeyman actor whose excellence has often graced good films in supporting roles, he here embraces the limelight with a performance of great restraint and power, conveying both the man's courage and his self-doubt with the most modest of gestures. It's not mimicry but a performance that effortlessly holds your attention, while never turning showy. Clooney himself does a nicely self-effacing turn as Murrow's ever-supportive producer Fred Friendly, and Frank Langella cuts a figure of imposing strength (and no little duplicity) as Paley. The rest of the cast pales by comparison, but Ray Wise has a few moments as the nervous Hollenback, as does Jeff Daniels as a network exec who's often delegated to do Paley's less savory tasks. Among the staffers, Reed Diamond, Tate Donovan and Robert John Burke stand out. One must also note the elegant black-and-white cinematography of Robert Elswit, which suits the period timeframe perfectly, as well as allowing Senator McCarthy to portray himself in television footage from the fifties--a device that will wisely deflect the charge that his character has been misrepresented by any actor's portrayal of him, as well as allowing him to convict himself in the film just as he did in real life. (Period footage is also employed in the ""Person to Person"" sequences, to fine effect.)All this praise shouldn't be taken to mean that ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is without flaws. A subplot involving those two newsroom employees, Shirley and Joe Wershba, who keep their marriage secret because of company regulations is given entirely too much time, even though the characters are played well enough by Patricia Clarkson and Robert Downey, Jr. (and are designed to act to a certain extent as audience surrogates). A linking mechanism involving cutaways to a singer crooning songs into a microphone in an adjacent studio is simply intrusive, though the songs are obviously designed to comment on the action as well as providing period flavor. And on the broader canvas, complaint could certainly be raised about a general slimming down of the record--a lack of full historical context, a simplification of events involving not only Murrow's personality but the whole anti-communist movement of the period (not all of which, after all, was unjustified).But to dismiss the picture on those grounds would be to condemn the ""Good"" as the enemy of the perfect. (The same criticism of failing to tell ""the whole truth"" could be leveled at ""All the President's Men,"" too.) This is a stylish, absorbing account of an episode in American journalistic history that has as much to teach us today as it did Murrow's audience half a century ago.",5,"""We will not walk in fear of

641680,A2BQBLCKJHP65G,B00005JOKM,"Eric Ericson ""RedSabbath""","[1, 3]","George Clooney's second attempt at the triple threat of filmmaking (actor/writer/director) that in 2005 got him and the film Oscar nominated 6 times (and winning none) sorta to me after five years didn't seem all that impressive. The true story of 1950's CBS journalist Edward R. Murrow's battle against the mass accusation of communism brought by then Senator Joseph McCarthy should have been alot more enthralling than this. Clooney definitely has the power to bring in some great A-List actors (Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Daniels, Patricia Clarkson, Frank Langella), but the story as a whole seems bogged down by pacing and too much stock footage used of the actual broadcasted interviews and original people involved. Murrow here is portrayed by character actor David Strathairn, who no doubt is very well at his craft, but lacks any real punch or drive like the real Murrow showed over fifty years ago. As a history lesson, it does educate the viewer in the now-absurd public witchhunt of the 1950's, but at times tends to entertain more like a school lesson than a motion picture.

Clooney definately has an appreciation for history in black and white.  Remember his CBS tv version of FAIL SAFE?It's a return to classic black and white filmaking, a return to a movie about GROWNUPS and a return to authentic historical storytelling.  As you watch this film and study the cinematography and camera angles, you can't help but feel remeniscent of watching the immortal classic, CITIZEN KANE.Despite the fact that it's a story of CBS's Edward R.

641682,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B00005JOKM,Erik North,"[5, 7]","Of all the embarrassments in our nation's history, the blatantly fanatical anti-Communist witchhunt of the 1950s conducted within the halls of Congress by Joseph McCarthy, the junior senator from Wisconsin, must rank as by far one of the worst.  But there was one man, legendary CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow, who dared to call the senator on it.  It is this clash of titans that is richly detailed in glorious black-and-white by director, co-writer, and co-star George Clooney in GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK (named for Murrow's trademark sign-off phrase on his nightly news broadcast).David Strathairn portrays Murrow down to almost the exact physical appearance and speech clip of the legendary newsman, as he and CBS news director Fred Friendly (Clooney) make the momentous decision to put the reputations of both themselves as journalists and human beings and the reputation of the CBS television network on the line, and confront the senator and his high-handed brand of demagoguery (utilizing authentic film footage of McCarthy from that turbulent time).  As Clooney and producer/co-writer Grant Heslov show, Murrow managed to undercut McCarthy's fanaticism and credibility by using the senator's own words and his lack of proof against the vast majority of Americans he accused of having ties to the Communists.  The film also showed how this was perhaps the very first example of television, which was largely still in its infancy, displaying the ability to shape the minds and opinions of people.  Frank Langella does an extremely good job of portraying CBS chief executive Bill Paley; and the excellent ensemble cast of Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Daniels, and Patricia Clarkson compliments this superb movie.Even though GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK is set in a time more than half a century in our past, it still feels shockingly relevant, which is almost certainly why Clooney decided to take this subject matter--this, and the fact that his father was himself a prominent newsman in Cincinnati.  We see the conflicts between reporting the truth on the news and concern for a network's profits and concerns over being the target of political investigations, and we realize that what was true back in the early 1950s still remains true in our present day with respect to dissension to an increasingly unpopular and deadly Iraq escapade.  This is, by any definition, the mark of politically liberal filmmaking, but so be it.  It is the right kind of film in the right place at the right time, just as Edward R. Murrow and his team were the right people in their time.  This kind of bravura filmmaking is the kind that Hollywood did so well throughout the 1960s and 1970s, and what it should begin to do again today.",5,Murrow Vs.

The Cold War had begun, spurring backyard bomb shelters and nuclear disaster preparation films. People lived in constant terror of ""The Big One"". ""Communism"", already on the list of ""evil"" words since the 1930s, became a downright threat. In the midst of this, Senator Joseph McCarthy (R - WI) claimed that communists had infiltrated various levels of American government. On various occassions he brandished lists of suspected individuals which varied in number from 57 to 205. These accusations, never accompanied by proof, nonetheless led to resignantions and firings and the fear that America lay vulnerable. Somehow McCarthy managed to put himself above criticism; even President Eisenhower never disparaged him publicly. Many of McCarthy's accusatory hearings were broadcast on the very new medium of television. Millions viewed them.Enter journalist Edward R. Murrow, one of the unsung pioneers of early television. Murrow had garnered a squeaky clean reputation following his coverage of the World War II London blitzkrieg bombings. His opening line ""This... is London"" crystallized the horror of the destruction. Murrow went on to work for CBS doing news and special interest stories. He set the standard for journalistic integrity as well as for celebrity interviews. But, most famously, he outright challenged Senator Joseph McCarthy. This film celebrates the stand that CBS and the staff of ""See It Now"" took against the ""Second Red Scare"".The film's black and white tone and the realistic settings place the viewer squarely in the 1950s. An ""as it happened"" feeling pervades the movie's 93 minutes as antiquated television technology comes to life in the studio sequences. Even social details, such as how CBS employees address their boss and the status of women in the workplace, receive subtle but detailed attention. The pacing remains deliberately slow. Most of the tension and drama gets revealed in intense facial expressions and ""come to my office"" episodes. This likely matches the historical reality. Filming sequences emphasize the nature of what Murrow and staff probably went through emotionally. They threw out a challenge and then tensely waited as if ""The Big One"" could drop right on their studio at any moment after sign off. This movie aims for ultra-realism in every respect. It wouldn't have worked in color.Murrow's first scene shows silhouetted smoke streaming out of his mouth and nose. Apparently he always had a cigarette (which unfortunately led to his death by lung cancer in 1965). Then he delivers a speech to a Broadcasting Convention that condemns the use of television to entertain and insulate the public. The speech doesn't conclude until the end of the film, when Murrow walks off screen accompanied by silence, a symbol that he remains unappreciated for his efforts. The challenge to McCarthyism begins as Murrow questions the discharge of Milo Radulovich from the Air Force on grounds of communism. Producer Fred Friendly, played by George Clooney - who also directed - receives a stern warning from two colonels. Scared but not deterred the crew broadcasts the controversial piece anyway. Then Murrow directly attacks McCarthy which leads to McCarthy's rebuttal and Murrow's final response to the Senator. These programs are historically credited with hastening the downfall of McCarthy, at least in the eyes of the public. Many thought McCarthy's attack on Murrow, reproduced with original footage, damaged the Senator more than the Newsman. Unfortunately, Murrow and Friendly pay the price for thier integrity in the end. The film's main narrative ends on this relatively sour note.David Strathairn's portrayal of Murrow is mesmerizing. Though we never really see anything of Murrow's private life, Strathairn's performance nonetheless conveys a strong sense of a deep and a complex individual. His inner intensity bellows.In the end, ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" comes off as a movie about journalistic integrity and the courage to stand up to authority gone wrong. It does not stray from politics, and some may not agree with its message. Regardless, it definitely gives a taste of the values of traditional journalism and broadcasting as it highights one of the greatest moments in television history. Viewers can absorb this depiction and use it as a benchmark for today's journalistic standards.",5,The alleviation of fear through media...,1149292800,"06 3, 2006",2006,4456,"['Fear', 'gripped', 'America', '1950s', 'time', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'had', 'turned', 'solidly', 'ally', 'enemy', 'Cold', 'War', 'had', 'begun', 'spurring', 'backyard', 'bomb', 'shelters', 'nuclear', 'disaster', 'preparation', 'films', 'People', 'lived', 'constant', 'terror', 'Big', 'One', 'Communism', 'already', 'list', 'evil', 'words', '1930s', 'became', 'downright', 'threat', 'midst', 'Senator', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'R', 'WI', 'claimed', 'communists', 'had', 'infiltrated', 'various', 'levels', 'American', 'government', 'various', 'occassions', 'brandished', 'lists', 'suspected', 'individuals', 'varied', 'number', '57', '205', 'accusations', 'never', 'accompanied', 'proof', 'nonetheless', 'led', 'resignantions', 'firings', 'fear', 'America', 'lay', 'vulnerable', 'Somehow', 'McCarthy', 'managed', 'put', 'criticism', 'even', 'President', 'Eisenhower', 'never', 'disparaged', 'publicly', 'Many', 'McCarthy', 'accusatory', 'hearings', 'were', 'broadcast', 'very', 'new', 'medium', 'television', 'Millions', 'viewed', 'them.Enter', 'journalist', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'one', 'unsung', 'pioneers', 'early', 'television', 'Murrow', 'had', 'garnered', 'squeaky', 'clean', 'reputation', 'following', 'coverage', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'London', 'blitzkrieg', 'bombings', 'opening', 'line', 'London', 'crystallized', 'horror', 'destruction', 'Murrow', 'went', 'work', 'CBS', 'doing', 'news', 'special', 'interest', 'stories', 'set', 'standard', 'journalistic', 'integrity', 'as', 'well', 'celebrity', 'interviews', 'most', 'famously', 'outright', 'challenged', 'Senator', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'film', 'stand', 'CBS', 'staff', 'See', 'Now', 'took', 'Second', 'Red', 'Scare', '.The', 'film', 'black', 'white', 'tone', 'realistic', 'settings', 'place', 'viewer', 'squarely', '1950s', 'happened', 'feeling', 'movie', '93', 'minutes', 'antiquated', 'television', 'technology', 'life', 'studio', 'sequences', 'Even', 'social', 'details', 'such', 'how', 'CBS', 'employees', 'address', 'boss', 'status', 'women', 'workplace', 'receive', 'subtle', 'detailed', 'attention', 'pacing', 'deliberately', 'slow', 'Most', 'tension', 'drama', 'revealed', 'intense', 'facial', 'expressions', 'come', 'office', 'episodes', 'likely', 'historical', 'reality', 'Filming', 'sequences', 'emphasize', 'nature', 'what', 'Murrow', 'staff', 'probably', 'went', 'emotionally', 'threw', 'out', 'challenge', 'then', 'tensely', 'waited', 'Big', 'One', 'could', 'drop', 'right', 'studio', 'moment', 'sign', 'off', 'movie', 'ultra-realism', 'respect', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'worked', 'color.Murrow', 'first', 'scene', 'shows', 'silhouetted', 'smoke', 'streaming', 'mouth', 'nose', 'Apparently', 'always', 'had', 'cigarette', 'unfortunately', 'led', 'death', 'lung', 'cancer', '1965', 'Then', 'speech', 'Broadcasting', 'Convention', 'use', 'television', 'entertain', 'insulate', 'public', 'speech', ""n't"", 'conclude', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'Murrow', 'walks', 'off', 'screen', 'accompanied', 'silence', 'symbol', 'unappreciated', 'efforts', 'challenge', 'McCarthyism', 'Murrow', 'questions', 'discharge', 'Milo', 'Radulovich', 'Air', 'Force', 'grounds', 'communism', 'Producer', 'Fred', 'Friendly', 'played', 'George', 'Clooney', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'stern', 'warning', 'two', 'colonels', 'Scared', 'not', 'deterred', 'crew', 'controversial', 'piece', 'anyway', 'Then', 'Murrow', 'directly', 'McCarthy', 'McCarthy', 'rebuttal', 'Murrow', 'final', 'response', 'Senator', 'programs', 'are', 'historically', 'credited', 'hastening', 'downfall', 'McCarthy', 'least', 'eyes', 'public', 'Many', 'thought', 'McCarthy', 'attack', 'Murrow', 'reproduced', 'original', 'footage', 'damaged', 'Senator', 'more', 'Newsman', 'Unfortunately', 'Murrow', 'Friendly', 'pay', 'price', 'thier', 'integrity', 'end', 'film', 'main', 'narrative', 'ends', 'relatively', 'sour', 'note.David', 'Strathairn', 'portrayal', 'Murrow', 'mesmerizing', 'never', 'really', 'see', 'anything', 'Murrow', 'private', 'life', 'Strathairn', 'performance', 'nonetheless', 'conveys', 'strong', 'sense', 'deep', 'complex', 'individual', 'inner', 'intensity', 'end', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'off', 'movie', 'journalistic', 'integrity', 'courage', 'stand', 'up', 'authority', 'gone', 'wrong', 'not', 'stray', 'politics', 'may', 'not', 'agree', 'message', 'Regardless', 'definitely', 'taste', 'values', 'traditional', 'journalism', 'broadcasting', 'one', 'greatest', 'moments', 'television', 'history', 'Viewers', 'can', 'absorb', 'depiction', 'use', 'benchmark', 'today', 'journalistic', 'standards']",N/A

Taylor ""GFT""","[2, 4]","During the early 1950s the United States of America valued conformity over honesty and integrity--a social lockstep driven by fears that the Soviet Union had infiltrated American government and society and sought to bring our society crashing into chaos. As the decade progressed, a number of politicians played upon those fears to their own greater glory, and few played harder than Senator Joseph McCarthy, who shocked the nation when he claimed to have factual evidence that numerous branches of the government were overrun by communists and communist sympathizers.Over the past decade or so a number of historians and critics, Anne Coulter among the latter, have attempted to rehabilitate Senator McCarthy's reputation by noting that there were indeed communist infiltrators at work in the United States government. This was doubtlessly true, but there are several problems with this pro-McCarthy argument. Chief among them is McCarthy himself. His accusations were not based on fact and were strewn with misinformation, and he showed a marked tendency to level them against two types of people: those who could not fight back and those who dared to criticize him. If McCarthy ever did manage to expose a communist it was by dumb luck only, and by 1954 even the members of his own party--including President Dwight Eisenhower--were openly disgusted by his behavior.GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK is the story of how Edward R. Murrow, possibly the single most respected reporter of his era, exposed McCarthy for what he was via a meticulously prepared news program. In the wake of this broadcast an outraged public turned against McCarthy and thus gave the Senate the public support required to end his reign of terror.  At the same time, it is also the story of television's role as entertainer ultimately undercut its role as news medium--and laid the destructive seeds of the ""news as entertainment"" format that today typically overpowers serious journalism.It is in many respects a fascinating film, its script drawn from the actual words of the actual people involved in the Murrow telecast.  It is memorably directed by George Clooney and remarkably performed by an ensemble cast that includes David Staitham, Robert Downey Jr., Frank Langella, and Clooney himself.  The black and white art direction and cinematography is brilliant, truly capturing the look and feel of the era; the pace is rapid fire; and it offers a series of pointed warnings about political bankruptcy and public expectations of television that ring true in no uncertain terms.Unfortunately, it also manages to ever so slightly miss the mark.  This is partly due to the film's divided intent: by refusing to focus specifically on either McCarthy or the issue of broadcast news it manages shortchange both.  It also errs in its use of considerable archival footage, which leaves us to wonder if we might be better off watching a documentary on McCarthy and Murrow instead of GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.  But the ultimate problem with the film is that gives zero context.  We are told nothing of the tenor of times, given no clear idea of what made McCarthy's claims seem initially viable, and indeed given no clear idea of what those claims actually were. We are simply given to understand that he is a danger to democracy and shown actual film footage of McCarthy to prove what we are assumed to already know.In the end, I have to say that it is always a good thing to be reminded of McCarthy. He stands as a warning to us against those who would play upon our fears for the sake of their own power.  It is also always a good thing to be reminded that ""finest hour"" events in television news tend to be few and far between largely because of the commercial, entertainment-oriented nature of the medium.  But GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LOOK isn't entirely successful in making its points in either direction.  The DVD includes a making-of documentary that is reasonably interesting and an audio commentary that is largely spurious.  Recommended, but primarily for those who already have enough historical knowledge to fill in the gaps.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",4,"""We Cannot Defend Freedom Abroad By Deserting It At Home""",1201996800,"02 3, 2008",2008,4123,"['early', '1950s', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'valued', 'conformity', 'honesty', 'integrity', 'social', 'lockstep', 'driven', 'fears', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'had', 'infiltrated', 'American', 'government', 'society', 'sought', 'bring', 'society', 'crashing', 'chaos', 'decade', 'progressed', 'number', 'politicians', 'played', 'fears', 'own', 'greater', 'glory', 'few', 'played', 'harder', 'Senator', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'who', 'shocked', 'nation', 'when', 'claimed', 'have', 'factual', 'evidence', 'numerous', 'branches', 'government', 'were', 'overrun', 'communists', 'communist', 'sympathizers.Over', 'past', 'decade', 'so', 'number', 'historians', 'critics', 'Anne', 'Coulter', 'latter', 'have', 'attempted', 'rehabilitate', 'Senator', 'McCarthy', 'reputation', 'noting', 'were', 'indeed', 'communist', 'infiltrators', 'work', 'United', 'States', 'government', 'was', 'doubtlessly', 'true', 'are', 'several', 'problems', 'pro-McCarthy', 'argument', 'Chief', 'McCarthy', 'accusations', 'were', 'not', 'based', 'fact', 'were', 'strewn', 'misinformation', 'showed', 'marked', 'tendency', 'level', 'two', 'types', 'people', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'fight', 'back', 'who', 'dared', 'criticize', 'McCarthy', 'ever', 'did', 'manage', 'expose', 'communist', 'was', 'dumb', 'luck', 'only', '1954', 'even', 'members', 'own', 'party', 'including', 'President', 'Dwight', 'Eisenhower', 'were', 'openly', 'disgusted', 'behavior.GOOD', 'NIGHT', 'AND', 'GOOD', 'LUCK', 'story', 'how', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'possibly', 'single', 'most', 'respected', 'reporter', 'era', 'exposed', 'McCarthy', 'what', 'was', 'meticulously', 'prepared', 'news', 'program', 'wake', 'broadcast', 'outraged', 'public', 'turned', 'McCarthy', 'thus', 'gave', 'Senate', 'public', 'support', 'required', 'end', 'reign', 'terror', 'same', 'time', 'also', 'story', 'television', 'role', 'entertainer', 'ultimately', 'undercut', 'role', 'news', 'medium', 'laid', 'destructive', 'seeds', 'news', 'entertainment', 'format', 'today', 'typically', 'serious', 'journalism.It', 'many', 'respects', 'fascinating', 'film', 'script', 'drawn', 'actual', 'words', 'actual', 'people', 'involved', 'Murrow', 'telecast', 'memorably', 'directed', 'George', 'Clooney', 'remarkably', 'performed', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'David', 'Staitham', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'Clooney', 'black', 'white', 'art', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'brilliant', 'truly', 'capturing', 'look', 'feel', 'era', 'pace', 'rapid', 'fire', 'series', 'pointed', 'warnings', 'political', 'bankruptcy', 'public', 'expectations', 'television', 'ring', 'true', 'uncertain', 'terms.Unfortunately', 'also', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'miss', 'mark', 'partly', 'due', 'film', 'divided', 'intent', 'refusing', 'focus', 'specifically', 'McCarthy', 'issue', 'broadcast', 'news', 'shortchange', 'also', 'use', 'considerable', 'archival', 'footage', 'wonder', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'watching', 'documentary', 'McCarthy', 'Murrow', 'instead', 'GOOD', 'NIGHT', 'AND', 'GOOD', 'LUCK', 'ultimate', 'problem', 'film', 'zero', 'context', 'are', 'told', 'nothing', 'tenor', 'times', 'given', 'clear', 'idea', 'what', 'made', 'McCarthy', 'claims', 'seem', 'initially', 'viable', 'indeed', 'given', 'clear', 'idea', 'what', 'claims', 'actually', 'were', 'are', 'simply', 'given', 'understand', 'danger', 'democracy', 'shown', 'actual', 'film', 'footage', 'McCarthy', 'prove', 'what', 'are', 'assumed', 'already', 'know.In', 'end', 'have', 'say', 'always', 'good', 'thing', 'be', 'reminded', 'McCarthy', 'warning', 'who', 'would', 'play', 'fears', 'sake', 'own', 'power', 'also', 'always', 'good', 'thing', 'be', 'reminded', 'finest', 'hour', 'events', 'television', 'news', 'tend', 'be', 'few', 'far', 'largely', 'commercial', 'entertainment-oriented', 'nature', 'medium', 'GOOD', 'NIGHT', 'AND', 'GOOD', 'LOOK', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'successful', 'making', 'points', 'direction', 'DVD', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'reasonably', 'interesting', 'audio', 'commentary', 'largely', 'spurious', 'Recommended', 'primarily', 'who', 'already', 'have', 'enough', 'historical', 'knowledge', 'fill', 'gaps.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

During the early 1950's the airwaves were filled with Senate hearings on Communist espionage activities in the US and those who were working as believers of communism or its agents.Senator Joseph Raymond McCarthy of Wisconsin began a televised investigation into the Soviet threat on American soil.  Unfortunately, noble pursuit of truth can become sidetracked.  Perhaps, Senator McCarthy allowed the fame of his crusade to override his reasoning.  Of course, his tendency to hard drinking was also a factor in his eventual fall from popularity and senatorial standing.This excellent film tells the story of Edward Roscoe Murrow, the CBS newscaster, who decided to take on the most powerful political figure of the day.  Clash of the Titans-indeed!Television, the strange box in the living room of American homes with its flickering black and white images, became the battleground for these titans.  Those who had these boxes watched the saga unfold.George Clooney brings vibrant life to this American story as its writer and director.  He tells it in a compelling manner which grabs your attention and holds it for the next ninety-three minutes in its black and white format.David Strathaim as Murrow is one fine piece of casting.  He is a fine actor with an impressive resume.This film was nominated for 6 Academy Awards, 4 Golden Globes, and won the National Board of Review Best Picture Award.  It is a remarkable film.If you want to read an excellent novel about Senator McCarthy, then check out--The Redhunter by William F. Buckley.  It is also available in audio format from Amazon.Below is the last statement from the famous March 9, 1954, SEE IT NOW broadcast:""The actions of the junior Senator from Wisconsin have caused alarm and dismay amongst our allies abroad, and given considerable comfort to our enemies. And whose fault is that? Not really his. He didn't create this situation of fear; he merely exploited it -- and rather successfully. Cassius was right.

That's the movie's main positive point. On the other hand, Clooney is as Irish as paddy's Pig, and Fred Friendly was as Jewish looking as they get. They should have cast a real Jew in that part for realism (maybe Ed Herrmann). Also, Frank Langella did a decent job as CBS Head William Paley, but looked NOTHING like him. These criticisms aside, the movie perfectly caught the tenor of the times, and using the female singer in a studio setting to bridge the scenes was brilliant. If you were alive in 1954, it takes you back. If not, it shows you what the world was like then. Beautifully acted by all (even those who were, in my opinion, miscast).

I fail to see why Senator McCarthy should receive such bad press because of his position with one such Communist-type: Edward R. Murrow himself.The crime here is that this movie will do very well based upon its soundtrack, special effects, and cinematography (including top-quality black and white.) All will no doubt say, ""It is a fantastic film; you simply must see it. It is probably the best film I've seen in years."" And after reading the other reviews, I can see that it is no doubt, a box office smash.What the average movie goer does not grasp however, is the brainwashing and propaganda that is spewed from the capital of American Communism: Hollywood, USA. As long as one can get the public eye to focus, there is nothing that one cannot accomplish.Someone wanted to finish Senator McCarthy off, once and for good, and this film will do just that. Hopefully, the folks in California will find reason for another successful director/producer to create a film that not only counters the present one, but seeks to convey the truth about what really happened.This movie will certainly entertain the movie goer, but I cannot see any edification in the process since the average American is incapable of thinking for him/herself.",1,"""Right On"" ""Wrong On""",1130371200,"10 27, 2005",2005,1619,"['have', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'only', 'reception', 'four-and-one-half', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'doubt', 'acting', 'effects', 'direction', 'else', 'yeild', 'top-quality', 'entertainment', 'material.Here', 'again', 'one', 'can', 'witness', 'yet', 'successful', 'attempt', 'Hollywood', 'sway', 'American', 'public', 'Boobus', 'Northamericanus', 'anyone', 'anything', 'might', 'discredit', 'same', 'fail', 'see', 'why', 'Senator', 'McCarthy', 'should', 'receive', 'such', 'bad', 'press', 'position', 'one', 'such', 'Communist-type', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'himself.The', 'crime', 'here', 'movie', 'will', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'based', 'soundtrack', 'special', 'effects', 'cinematography', 'including', 'top-quality', 'black', 'white', 'will', 'doubt', 'say', 'fantastic', 'film', 'simply', 'must', 'see', 'probably', 'best', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'can', 'see', 'doubt', 'box', 'office', 'smash.What', 'average', 'movie', 'goer', 'not', 'grasp', 'however', 'brainwashing', 'propaganda', 'spewed', 'capital', 'American', 'Communism', 'Hollywood', 'USA', 'As', 'long', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'public', 'eye', 'focus', 'nothing', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'accomplish.Someone', 'wanted', 'finish', 'Senator', 'McCarthy', 'once', 'good', 'film', 'will', 'do', 'just', 'Hopefully', 'folks', 'California', 'will', 'find', 'reason', 'successful', 'director/producer', 'create', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'present', 'one', 'convey', 'truth', 'what', 'really', 'happened.This', 'movie', 'will', 'certainly', 'entertain', 'movie', 'goer', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'edification', 'process', 'average', 'American', 'incapable', 'thinking', 'him/herself']",N/A

Not unlike now!  And that is one reason this film carries so much resonance: the story of the bravery of popular news reporter Edward R. Morrow (David Strathairn) and his associates Fred Friendly (George Clooney), Joe and Shirley Wershba (Robert Downey, Jr. and Patricia Clarkson), William Paley (Frank Langella) and the crew at CBS is one that begs for re-creation in the way the news is reported, analyzed, and serves the rights of the public to be truly informed.The story is the 1950s McCarthyism Communist Hunting that terrified the country unchecked until Morrow et al challenged the Senator's accusations and methodology by simply quoting the statements McCarthy made in the television series See It Now.  Morrow and his associates did not elect to smear McCarthy: they instead elected to bring to the public's quivering attention just what the sick mind of McCarthy was doing to innocent people. It was an act of bravery on Morrow's part and on the part of everyone connected with See It Now.George Clooney continues to impress as a quiet, subtle voice who doesn't seek the limelight for his brilliant mind, but rather uses it to enter the arena of emerging patriots - the good kind.  He wrote the script with Grant Heslov after much research and investigation and then gathered a gifted crew of actors (including himself) and directed the film using the atmosphere of black and white photography (credit cinematographer Robert Elswit) in the almost exclusively interior claustrophobic set of the television station to give the ring of honesty that pulsates this story to its powerful end.  Strathairn is brilliant as Morrow, but then so are all the cast members in this ensemble effort.GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK is an immensely entertaining film  on every level, but the fact that it is released in such a realistic fashion at this particular time in  the nation's precarious history makes it a film that should be seen by everyone.

Murrow stands in stark relief as the only brave man willing to stand up to McCarthy, juxtaposed with a couple and a fellow journalist who stand in for ""ordinary people"" (fearful, unable to cope with the pressure).If you are looking for a civics lesson and a morality tale of the bravery of the lone hero, you'll like this movie.

That's bad, no matter what party you belong to.  For me, choosing Edward R. Murrow to put a microscope on that time, and show the financial and political forces behind every message put out via American media (even today), was a brilliant choice.  Not only because Murrow had the spine to speak out on behalf of average Joes, but also because he was a victim of slur attempts himself.Of course, this movie is as much about today as the 1950s.  The environment of fear propagated by Senator McCarthy's anti-communist excesses back then is a fair analogy to those who today bring up 9/11 anytime they have a chance to heighten fears, which they then claim to protect against.  Although events have since proven them to be incompetent and deceitful as protectors, they have again demonstrated how easy it is to use such fear-mongering to turn people against each other for the gain of a powerful few.  To its credit, this movie captures that, as well.The acting here is good across the board, but David Strathairn, as Murrow, and Frank Langella, as CBS head Bill Paley, are far better than anyone else in this film.  Clooney gets very good marks as the Director (and creator), but his acting here is nothing special, and Robert Downey, Jr. is wrong for his part.  Downey is good in many roles, but they would have been better off casting a lesser-known character actor in his role.  All in all, though, it's very well done -- and every actor in it should get a medal just for the all-too-real smoking scenes.  A young person today might think the film exagerates the smoking, but I'm just old enough to have witnessed similar work environments in my youth.As for the DVD, I was very disappointed that it has no actual footage of Murrow.  The ""Making of..."" Special Feature is pretty funny, and it is interesting to hear from Murrow's son and some of Murrow's actual staff.  Still, Strathairn does such a spot-on job of portraying Murrow that I went directly to the Special Features after watching the film, certain that they would show the real guy...but, no.  Thus, to make it more fun, I recommend that when you get this movie you also try to get another DVD showing the real Murrow -- just so you can watch Strathairn, then watch Murrow, and see how perfectly he (Strathairn) captured the journalist.",4,"Great Movie, But The DVD Is Just OK",1147132800,"05 9, 2006",2006,2602,"['are', 'politically', 'liberal', 'conservative', 'somewhere', 'in-between', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'great', 'job', 'capturing', 'period', '1950s', 'when', 'took', 'was', 'accusation', 'substantiated', 'not', 'throw', 'American', 'life', 'family', 'downward', 'spiral', 'bad', 'matter', 'what', 'party', 'belong', 'choosing', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'put', 'microscope', 'time', 'show', 'financial', 'political', 'forces', 'message', 'put', 'out', 'American', 'media', 'even', 'today', 'was', 'brilliant', 'choice', 'Not', 'only', 'Murrow', 'had', 'spine', 'speak', 'out', 'behalf', 'average', 'Joes', 'also', 'was', 'victim', 'slur', 'attempts', 'himself.Of', 'course', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'today', '1950s', 'environment', 'fear', 'propagated', 'Senator', 'McCarthy', 'anti-communist', 'excesses', 'back', 'then', 'fair', 'analogy', 'who', 'today', 'bring', 'up', '9/11', 'anytime', 'have', 'chance', 'heighten', 'fears', 'then', 'claim', 'protect', 'events', 'have', 'proven', 'be', 'incompetent', 'deceitful', 'protectors', 'have', 'again', 'demonstrated', 'how', 'easy', 'use', 'such', 'fear-mongering', 'turn', 'people', 'other', 'gain', 'powerful', 'few', 'credit', 'movie', 'well.The', 'acting', 'here', 'good', 'board', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'Murrow', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'CBS', 'head', 'Bill', 'Paley', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'anyone', 'else', 'film', 'Clooney', 'very', 'good', 'marks', 'Director', 'creator', 'acting', 'here', 'nothing', 'special', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'wrong', 'part', 'Downey', 'good', 'many', 'roles', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'off', 'casting', 'lesser-known', 'character', 'actor', 'role', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'actor', 'should', 'get', 'medal', 'just', 'all-too-real', 'smoking', 'scenes', 'young', 'person', 'today', 'might', 'think', 'film', 'smoking', ""'m"", 'just', 'old', 'enough', 'have', 'witnessed', 'similar', 'work', 'environments', 'youth.As', 'DVD', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'actual', 'footage', 'Murrow', 'Making', 'Special', 'Feature', 'pretty', 'funny', 'interesting', 'hear', 'Murrow', 'son', 'Murrow', 'actual', 'staff', 'Still', 'Strathairn', 'spot-on', 'job', 'portraying', 'Murrow', 'went', 'directly', 'Special', 'Features', 'watching', 'film', 'certain', 'would', 'show', 'real', 'guy', 'Thus', 'make', 'more', 'fun', 'recommend', 'when', 'get', 'movie', 'also', 'try', 'get', 'DVD', 'showing', 'real', 'Murrow', 'just', 'can', 'watch', 'Strathairn', 'then', 'watch', 'Murrow', 'see', 'how', 'perfectly', 'Strathairn', 'captured', 'journalist']",N/A

Much of it is mock cinema verite, which works because of the right-on cinematography, the terrific art direction, and the clipped, no-nonsense dialogue.  The B&W; effect works great,setting not only the historical dimension of the story, but metaphorically as well:  Murrow is able to beat his rival with the black and white facts: something nearly impossible to do today owing to the spin masters and myrmidons that head mainstream news media. Even the length of the film, less than 90 minutes contributes to the straightforward, sub-plotless story: a film that can be viewed like a news report.  The props, sets, costuming, haircuts are hyperealistically accurate and Frank Langella does an excellent turn as William Paley.  Seeing both the simulated footage and recreated footage of some of the 'hearings,' it is interesting to note how politicians seemed to have a candid, truthful manner in front of the TV camera, perhaps because they hadn't yet mastered the medium, or that there was even a medium that needed to be mastered.Today, a McCarthy-type would need only lose about twenty pounds, get better tailored suits, firm up his sagging chin, and take some voice lessons, and voila, people would never suspect he was a foolish, lying bum.

But this one is different. Different because it is in black and white and it is a real smoking factory : politically correctness is forbidden. Different because it is not about the cinema but essentially about television, CBS. The real fourth power of the media : the power of journalism reinforced by the power of images. This television produces news programs that become the 21st century gospels. This power is absolutely enormous. And yet it is not CBS that brings McCarthy down, nor Murrow. It is McCarthy himself who brings himself down when he decides to react to Murrow on television and rebut him. In other words he falls in the trap laid in front of him and is unable to cope with this medium : he appears like what he is, a bigot, and he attacks someone who is beyond doubt in the wide public, a gospel writer as I have already said. Then McCarthy is doomed. This film hence shows something most people ignore on the old continent as well as on the new continent. The USA, like any human society, contains both good and evil because good cannot exist without evil and vice versa. But the USA, like any human society founded on the belief that individuals have rights and are fundamentally free as individuals and as citizens, will contain evil by its own efforts because good is necessarily stronger, even if at times it takes a few years to get around an obstacle and get into a dominant position. It is true some damage may have been caused during the period when evil had the upper hand, but good will push that evil down and aside sooner or later. Unluckily in such a society evil will find its way back up one day and will have to be pushed down again. But that is democracy and to believe that good, provided we all agree on what good is, can triumph once and for all is just as narrow-minded as the belief that communism had triumphed in 1917 once and for all.

641708,A1EBJ93E1T50RT,B00005JOKM,Jason A. Miller,"[6, 9]","""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is a brilliant period piece and re-enactment of a series of history-changing events.  George Clooney's direction is wise beyond his years, and the the cast is brilliant.  For all that intensity, however, the movie has just a little too much of Edward R. Murrow's famous ice-water in its veins, and when the last 10 minutes lag behind the setup of the first 80, there's an audible let-down.  While the movie is a can't miss in terms of films you ought to see, it manages to just miss film immortality by a narrow margin.The ensemble cast is led by David Straithairn, who's been turning in quietly great performances for years as less-than-noble characters in places like ""Dolores Claiborne"" and ""Eight Men Out"" and ""The Sopranos"".  His Murrow here is most assuredly not an imitation, not a case of an actor just reading somebody else's lines.  His job is to inflate Murrow's original words into something suitable for the big screen, without crossing the line over into melodrama or sounding like an actor playing the governor at Colonial Williamsburgh.  His ""off"" moments, when the TV cameras stop transmitting but director Clooney continues to show us Murrow in the darkened studio, are similarly filled with Strathairn's audible thoughts.The use of archival footage to portray McCarthy and Roy Cohn, juxtaposed against Strathairn's red-hot chilliness, keeps the events firmly grounded in reality, without a hammy actor playing McCarthy as a black hat, or some Harrison Ford type playing Murrow as the Patron Saint of Journalists.  Indeed, Murrow's lack of superpowers is shown when he's unable to save his doomed broadcaster friend, Don Hollenbeck, from the rantings of a right-wing media watchdog.Comedy is provided in a post-modern way, as Strathairn silently conveys Murrow's frustrations at having to ask Liberace, during the TV interview program ""Person to Person"", about why he's not yet taken a wife.  I saw this movie in a sold-out theater, and the laughter in this scene nearly drowned out the dialgoue.  Also funny is the presentation of an authentic '50s cigarette commercial -- indeed the whole movie is wreathed in smoke so thick that you'd think the visual effects team should get a Best Supporting Actor nod for outstanding portrayal of cigarette fumes.The rest of the cast is full of distinguished actors from film and TV... Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Daniels, Reed Diamond (late of ""Homicide""), Frank Langella (evidently playing Christopher Plummer), and even Alex Borstein of ""Family Guy"" (you can almost hear her whining ""Peeeter"" in her early scenes).  If there's a problem to the story, it's that the secondary characters, with the exception of Langella as a tormented William Paley, never generate much spark beyond the face- or name-recognition.  When the main story ends, the movie drags on for another 10 minutes wrapping up loose ends among the guest cast.  The end of the movie can't sustain the intensity of the first 80 minutes.The McCarthy/Murrow story remains an important one in today's world, in the same way that the retelling of the Salem witch trials echoed so meaningfully at the time of the original McCarthy hearings.  ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is something more than just a History Channel documentary about old-time events, but at the same time it is on some level done in by its own narrative, as the story by definition cannot have a happy ending or a dramatic grand finale.

In the 1950's when the country was riding the high road of prosperity, Americans were enjoying the benefits of the second world war. With little to fear, it was left to the government to create one. It was called the ""Red scare"" or Communism. Most Americans were too complacent to worry about it. Thus it was left to one man to not only terrorize us with that fear, but to cultivate it. That individual was Joseph MaCarthy who hitched his star to a threat not of his creation, but his decision to feed, nurture and manipulate it to destroy the lives, careers and dreams of many citizens. In this remarkable film, audiences are given the rare opportunity to witness the classic confrontation between the Junior senator from Wisconsin and the controversial, chain-smoking hero of CBS, one Edward R. Murrow (superbly play by David Strathairn.) The film is in Black and white as were the issues of the day. Noted for it's caricatures of the CBS news staff, the film pointedly reveals the uncertainties, triumphs and tragedies of the times.

The project quickly became a vast success. Feeling threatened by the advance of the CIA, J. Edgar Hoover, director of the FBI, began to spy on CIA agents and their affiliates digging deep into their past. Hoover soon uncovered details linking high profile figures of state to the Communist party. Hoover passed these details onto Sen. Joseph McCarthy. Edward R. Murrow was on the direct payroll of the CIA at the time and excepted large sums of cash during the ""Project Mockingbird"" days. Murrow along with CBS and several newspapers were ordered to go after Joseph McCarthy by The Washington Post, when McCarthy dug too close to the CIA's domestic interests. The Washington Post held a key role in this propaganda network as it was the duty of the Post to keep an eye over the industry.  On the request of Hoover, McCarthy erroneously went after CIA agent Cord Meyer. Meyer may have held some Communist ties but was heavily protected by his friends at the CIA, which included Allen W. Dulles and Frank Wisner.Wisner, outraged by McCarthy's actions, unleashed ""Mockingbird"" on Sen. McCarthy. Soon the CIA was paying bribes to correspondents at: NBC, The New York Herald Tribune, CBS, and dozens of affiliates to portray McCarthy in an intensely negative light.Alfred Friendly (played by George Clooney) was a former intelligence man during World War II, who later became an IC (Independent Contractor) for the CIA while working at the Washington Post.

DeMeo ""naturalenergyworks""","[4, 31]","The Communist Parties globally killed over 100 million people in the 20th Century (seeThe Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression), the larger percentage of which occurred before or during the years when the House UnAmerican Activities Committee and its related hearings in the US Senate (under Joseph McCarthy and others) were making extended documentation of those genocidal crimes, as well as trying to root out Communist apologists for such genocide within the US government.  While it may be true that McCarthy ""gave anti-communism a bad name"", in fact history increasingly shows he was correct about the persons being exposed in his hearings.  The black woman, for example, Annie Lee Moss, was employed in high-security code-room work, and had access to secret cables going around the world -- in fact she was a member of the CP USA, and the glorified Edward R. Murrow was in fact a former member of the IWW -- a communist outfit.  One could go down the list of American communist operatives who, in the 1950s were defended with great passion by members of the American left media, but who were later fingered as authentic Soviet spys by the Venona Transcripts (seeVenona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America) or by defecting Soviet spys.The fact is the Western media was slowly infiltrated by various brands of Marxist and socialist radicals, starting during the WW-2 period when we made an unfortunate alliance of convenience with the Soviet monster, to help defeat the Nazi monster, and the situation has only gotten worse.  The fact also is, that nearly ALL of the committees in Congress and the Justice Department, which once investigated foreign conspirators using American social institutions to help destroy America, are today shut down. So they have ascended to many positions of power and influence, without any official efforts to expose them, or root them out.  Conservative historians and websites repeatedly expose them, but nothing is done about it, except for the left-media and Hollywood to make revisionist hit-pieces against anyone who dares to raise a voice against them.  This film makes such a revisionist history, in keeping with communist agendas.  It is both overt and covert CP activists working with a larger number of what we might call, the ""characterological communists"" of the left, to present yet another hit-piece targeting American conservative voices who sought to oppose such Soviet-style (and now Islamofascist-style) atrocity around the world.  None of that history is mentioned in the film, as a background to the motivations of American conservatives such as McCarthy -- the over 100 million massacre victims of Marxist utopianism and plunder.  For a corrective, I recommendThe Soviet StoryDVD, to give you a quick overview of what ""journalists"" like Murrow were deliberately covering up.  One might ask, just how many people would the International Communists have to murder before the American Left would undertake a re-think, and start to study the authentic history of the 20th Century, something other than the usual list of leftist revisionist authors, who are no better than the neo-Nazi revisionist authors.If George Clooney had dared to include the facts about Communist genocides into his film, exposing what we today know about Hiss, the Rosenburgs, and even Annie Moss, it would have made it far more intensive, showing McCarthy as someone who was more than the usual misrepresented cartoon personality, and Murrow being a self-righteous, compromised and even pathetic character (his constant nervous chewing on cigarettes); that would have more than compensated for the slow plodding course of the plot, building towards a greater emotion and substance, to make a really great film.  He didn't, however, because he is one of those ""characterological communists"" whose ignorance of world history is staggering. So instead, we are treated, once more, to yet another a Hollywood film whose goal appears to be little more than rubbing merde into the face of mainstream American conservatism, while ignoring or excusing multiple liberal treasons and apologetics for Marxist mass-murder.",1,"A total white-wash of communist crimes, and slander against anti-communism",1296518400,"02 1, 2011",2011,4153,"['Communist', 'Parties', 'globally', 'killed', '100', 'million', 'people', '20th', 'Century', 'seeThe', 'Black', 'Book', 'Communism', 'Crimes', 'Terror', 'Repression', 'larger', 'percentage', 'occurred', 'years', 'when', 'House', 'UnAmerican', 'Activities', 'Committee', 'related', 'hearings', 'US', 'Senate', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'others', 'were', 'making', 'extended', 'documentation', 'genocidal', 'crimes', 'as', 'well', 'trying', 'root', 'out', 'Communist', 'apologists', 'such', 'genocide', 'US', 'government', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'McCarthy', 'gave', 'anti-communism', 'bad', 'name', 'fact', 'history', 'increasingly', 'was', 'correct', 'persons', 'being', 'exposed', 'hearings', 'black', 'woman', 'example', 'Annie', 'Lee', 'Moss', 'was', 'employed', 'high-security', 'code-room', 'work', 'had', 'access', 'secret', 'cables', 'going', 'world', 'fact', 'was', 'member', 'CP', 'USA', 'glorified', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'was', 'fact', 'former', 'member', 'IWW', 'communist', 'outfit', 'One', 'could', 'go', 'down', 'list', 'American', 'communist', 'operatives', 'who', '1950s', 'were', 'defended', 'great', 'passion', 'members', 'American', 'left', 'media', 'who', 'were', 'later', 'fingered', 'authentic', 'Soviet', 'spys', 'Venona', 'Transcripts', 'seeVenona', 'Decoding', 'Soviet', 'Espionage', 'America', 'defecting', 'Soviet', 'spys.The', 'fact', 'Western', 'media', 'was', 'slowly', 'infiltrated', 'various', 'brands', 'Marxist', 'socialist', 'radicals', 'starting', 'WW-2', 'period', 'when', 'made', 'unfortunate', 'alliance', 'convenience', 'Soviet', 'monster', 'help', 'defeat', 'Nazi', 'monster', 'situation', 'only', 'gotten', 'worse', 'fact', 'also', 'nearly', 'committees', 'Congress', 'Justice', 'Department', 'once', 'investigated', 'foreign', 'conspirators', 'using', 'American', 'social', 'institutions', 'help', 'destroy', 'America', 'are', 'today', 'shut', 'down', 'have', 'ascended', 'many', 'positions', 'power', 'influence', 'official', 'efforts', 'expose', 'root', 'out', 'Conservative', 'historians', 'websites', 'repeatedly', 'expose', 'nothing', 'done', 'left-media', 'Hollywood', 'make', 'revisionist', 'hit-pieces', 'anyone', 'who', 'raise', 'voice', 'film', 'revisionist', 'history', 'keeping', 'communist', 'agendas', 'overt', 'covert', 'CP', 'activists', 'working', 'larger', 'number', 'what', 'might', 'call', 'characterological', 'communists', 'left', 'present', 'yet', 'hit-piece', 'targeting', 'American', 'conservative', 'voices', 'who', 'sought', 'oppose', 'such', 'Soviet-style', 'now', 'Islamofascist-style', 'atrocity', 'world', 'None', 'history', 'mentioned', 'film', 'background', 'motivations', 'American', 'conservatives', 'such', 'McCarthy', '100', 'million', 'massacre', 'victims', 'Marxist', 'utopianism', 'plunder', 'corrective', 'recommendThe', 'Soviet', 'StoryDVD', 'give', 'quick', 'overview', 'what', 'journalists', 'Murrow', 'were', 'deliberately', 'covering', 'up', 'One', 'might', 'ask', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'International', 'Communists', 'have', 'murder', 'American', 'Left', 'would', 'undertake', 're-think', 'start', 'study', 'authentic', 'history', '20th', 'Century', 'something', 'other', 'usual', 'list', 'leftist', 'revisionist', 'authors', 'who', 'are', 'better', 'neo-Nazi', 'revisionist', 'authors.If', 'George', 'Clooney', 'had', 'dared', 'include', 'facts', 'Communist', 'genocides', 'film', 'exposing', 'what', 'today', 'know', 'Hiss', 'Rosenburgs', 'even', 'Annie', 'Moss', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'far', 'more', 'intensive', 'showing', 'McCarthy', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'more', 'usual', 'misrepresented', 'cartoon', 'personality', 'Murrow', 'being', 'self-righteous', 'compromised', 'even', 'pathetic', 'character', 'constant', 'nervous', 'chewing', 'cigarettes', 'would', 'have', 'more', 'compensated', 'slow', 'plodding', 'course', 'plot', 'building', 'towards', 'greater', 'emotion', 'substance', 'make', 'really', 'great', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'however', 'one', 'characterological', 'communists', 'ignorance', 'world', 'history', 'staggering', 'So', 'instead', 'are', 'treated', 'once', 'more', 'yet', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'goal', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'rubbing', 'merde', 'face', 'mainstream', 'American', 'conservatism', 'ignoring', 'excusing', 'multiple', 'liberal', 'treasons', 'apologetics', 'Marxist', 'mass-murder']",N/A

Murrow is absolutely incredible -- indistinguishable in look, temperament and mannerism from actual footage of Murrow from the 1950s. Murrow comes across as dark, brooding and intense - an image not lightened by TV's harsh lighting and black-and-white spectrum. That verisimilitude carries throughout the film as well, as it captures the fashions, habits and psychological realities of the Cold War era.""Good Night and Good Luck"" is a political film in the best sense. Like Arthur Miller's ""The Crucible,"" this film depicts one era in order to shed light on contemporary issues. In the 1950s, the issue was Senator Joe McCarthy's self-serving persecution of supposed communists in the American government and arts establishment. The American institutions that might have corralled McCarthy were mostly silent, cowed by the Senator's bully-boy tactics, lies and smears. The media, concerned about losing corporate sponsorship, opted for safe fare like quiz shows and Uncle Miltie. That is, until CBS newsman and TV host Edgar Murrow decided to confront McCarthy head-on.Of course, the impact of the film's political message depends on whether one sees similarities to the situation today. Director George Clooney, for one, clearly is using the film to criticize both the current government and the mainstream media. One's view of the film is bound to be colored by one's personal opinions on the matter.Murrow's 1958 speech to his CBS peers - a device that frames the film - is a challenge to use television as something more than a mere box of wires and lights. In Murrow's opinion, using a powerful medium to amuse and distract without educating and broadening is not just a wasted opportunity but a sign of America's imminent demise.The ensemble cast (incuding Clooney, Mort Downey, Jr. and Jeff Bridges) functioned impressively to give the impression of real working entity. The film's use of actual archival footage of Senator McCarthy was inspired -- having an actor play the man would have played into the charge that Clooney was exagerrating him. For all the seriousness of the film, Clooney is not above having a little fun: inserting actual commercials for Alcoa and Kent cigarettes were fun as period anchors as well as underscoring the issue of product sponsorship that continues to bedevil the media.Thankfully, Clooney lets the facts speak for themselves and does not sermonize. I found the film to be even-handed and inspiring. Murrow's brand of truth-telling does not go down smoothly, but is absolutely essential for the proper functioning of a democracy. ""Good Night, And Good Luck"" presents the Murrow story effectively and engagingly -- and none too soon.",5,"""We cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home.""",1131235200,"11 6, 2005",2005,2798,"['Politics', 'aside', 'moment', 'let', 'get', 'one', 'thing', 'way', 'right', 'off', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'impersonation', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'absolutely', 'incredible', 'indistinguishable', 'look', 'temperament', 'mannerism', 'actual', 'footage', 'Murrow', '1950s', 'Murrow', 'dark', 'brooding', 'intense', 'image', 'not', 'lightened', 'TV', 'harsh', 'lighting', 'black-and-white', 'spectrum', 'verisimilitude', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'fashions', 'habits', 'psychological', 'realities', 'Cold', 'War', 'era', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'political', 'film', 'best', 'sense', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'Crucible', 'film', 'one', 'era', 'order', 'shed', 'light', 'contemporary', 'issues', '1950s', 'issue', 'was', 'Senator', 'Joe', 'McCarthy', 'self-serving', 'persecution', 'supposed', 'communists', 'American', 'government', 'arts', 'establishment', 'American', 'institutions', 'might', 'have', 'corralled', 'McCarthy', 'were', 'mostly', 'silent', 'cowed', 'Senator', 'bully-boy', 'tactics', 'lies', 'smears', 'media', 'concerned', 'losing', 'corporate', 'sponsorship', 'opted', 'safe', 'fare', 'quiz', 'shows', 'Uncle', 'Miltie', 'CBS', 'newsman', 'TV', 'host', 'Edgar', 'Murrow', 'decided', 'confront', 'McCarthy', 'head-on.Of', 'course', 'impact', 'film', 'political', 'message', 'one', 'similarities', 'situation', 'today', 'Director', 'George', 'Clooney', 'one', 'clearly', 'using', 'film', 'criticize', 'current', 'government', 'mainstream', 'media', 'One', 'view', 'film', 'bound', 'be', 'colored', 'one', 'personal', 'opinions', 'matter.Murrow', '1958', 'speech', 'CBS', 'peers', 'device', 'film', 'challenge', 'use', 'television', 'something', 'more', 'mere', 'box', 'wires', 'lights', 'Murrow', 'opinion', 'using', 'powerful', 'medium', 'amuse', 'distract', 'educating', 'broadening', 'not', 'just', 'wasted', 'opportunity', 'sign', 'America', 'imminent', 'demise.The', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'incuding', 'Clooney', 'Mort', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'functioned', 'impressively', 'give', 'impression', 'real', 'working', 'entity', 'film', 'use', 'actual', 'archival', 'footage', 'Senator', 'McCarthy', 'was', 'inspired', 'having', 'actor', 'play', 'man', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'charge', 'Clooney', 'was', 'exagerrating', 'seriousness', 'film', 'Clooney', 'not', 'having', 'little', 'fun', 'inserting', 'actual', 'commercials', 'Alcoa', 'Kent', 'cigarettes', 'were', 'fun', 'period', 'anchors', 'as', 'well', 'underscoring', 'issue', 'product', 'sponsorship', 'bedevil', 'media.Thankfully', 'Clooney', 'facts', 'speak', 'not', 'sermonize', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'even-handed', 'inspiring', 'Murrow', 'brand', 'truth-telling', 'not', 'go', 'down', 'smoothly', 'absolutely', 'essential', 'proper', 'functioning', 'democracy', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'Murrow', 'story', 'effectively', 'engagingly', 'none', 'too', 'soon']",N/A

One review actually seems to be complaining because it wasn't enough like Clooney's ""Batman"" performances.  All and all this was an incredible film about an important subject, like any Hollywood depiction of an actual time or place there were some factual inaccuracies, but ""Good Night and Good Luck"" can hardly be faulted because it didn't go into depth about communist activities or about other newsmen attacking McCarthy.  That being said the film is in black and white and is about politics in the 50's, if those are things that you can't get passed just don't watch it, don't take home a black and white ""Documentary"" styled film then spend the next week ranting online about how ""I didn't like learning when I was in school and I don't like it now"" (paraphrasing a real review on Amazon).  Also it is low on action so if the topic itself doesn't interest you the film won't; far and away the most animated character is found in the real life clips of Senator McCarthy carrying out his witch hunts.  It is hard not to draw parallels between McCarthyism and the current administration as many other reviewers have pointed out but the film is best watched for what it is, the retelling of one of the most important battles in American history, not the fight between Murrow and McCarthy but the struggle between our civil liberties and out desire for security.

The second best part was the background jazz music. The acting and casting were outstanding. The movie evoked the era very well: the smoking, the drinking, and the language. Clooney wisely had several of Murrow's editorials read on the air in the movie. Murrow's strong prose in his editorials carried the movie.I did not give the movie five stars for little reasons. Strathairn, although he duplicated the speech patterns of Murrow, he did not evoke Murrow for me. Furthermore, there were some loose ends in the movie. People were called to talk to the CBS's lawyers, but that was all you heard about it. The movie did not evoke the fear of the communist threat very well. The movie made McCarthy out to be a complete idiot. What the movie audience might not now understand was that Communism infiltration was a palpable threat. McCarthy could not gain the power he did without a legimate threat. You could taste it back then. The majority of the threats were imagined, but a few were real. McCarthy's evil was that he went about addressing the threat in the worst way possible. If a democratic government can not stand public scrutiny of its actions or enforce the writ of habeas corpus, how good is that government? We need to balance carefully our need for security and our freedoms. McCarthy obviously crossed the line, but the movie did not explain the context of how he came into power. The movie did not evoke the cold war atmosphere that well.Again, I strongly recommend the movie. The movie tells an important story and tells it in a very entertaining manner.

One of the problems faced when a movie is made concerning recent events and characters is that the public can still remember the originals.  This was very skillfully addressed in this movie by interlacing the actors with historical footage that made sense--as opposed to trying to electronically weave them together.This movie is too confined to be considered a history lesson in the period of McCarthy/Kefauver paranoia.  However, it is probably wise in narrowing the scope of coverage.  It would not be possible to encompass all this area meant, including the shocking lack of leadership by President Eisenhower in denouncing the hysteria until it was winding down.I wish I'd purchased the 2-DVD set simply to see the production details.  I am curious regarding which scenes were shot on a location vs. created sets.  Geography was limited to what appears to be a couple of buildings.Black-and-white movies, like black-and-white photos, have a certain artistry because they can only speak in a limited vocabulary.  Unlike the old classic b/w films of the last century, its use here is intentional and sometimes obtrusive.  What with the constant smoking and the haze floating through so many scenes one wonders how people found their way around!  It was fun to watch, but overdone.  Unlike the best b/w films of the distant past, this movie doesn't let you forget its technique; it wants you to notice it.  I was alive then and it never was that dark!All the actors were good, the filming was sufficiently gray and dark that it took a while to recognize Mr. Clooney.  I suppose Frank Langella did a decent portrayal of Mr. Paley, but perhaps I've read too much on Mr. Paley to buy into it.  Ed Murrow was a womanizer and party animal, but we certainly saw none of that in this movie.I purchased this movie and saw it within a couple of days of buying and watching ""Walk the Line"".

He feels the pressure of Murrow's broadcasts & the fear of sponsors deserting CBS. He wavers but ultimately does the right thing & supports Murrow. In Senator McCarthy's mind either you were with him or a communist. He accuses Murrow of being a red which was a lie. But by that time ""tail gunner Joe"" was finished. Murrow's broadcasts were merely the final push. This movie is not your typical entertainment per se but it is gripping, serious. drama. If I say the word history, many will scurry away.

It is disheartening that he chooses to finish this otherwise inspirational story with a reflection that, even in 1954, broadcast journalism was not ""what it used to be,"" and that cynics will ultimately be proven correct.You see, the movie also makes us reflect (almost unconsciously) about how many things are better now that they were fifty years ago...1.  Nowhere near as many people smoke as did then - and Murrow himself died of lung cancer.2.  The internet has become our great democratizer.  Paley's character is an autocrat - someone who OWNS the media and who thus decides what people will and won't see.  Today the relative power of centralized media - TV and newspapers - might be concentrated in fewer hands, but it is ever so much more balanced through blogs, listservs and other democratizing forces.3.  Anybody can produce a documentary.  There's one circulating now about 9/11, for example.

It presents in a very short hour and a half a very compelling picture of a very dark time in the history of the U.S. I won't bore you with a long diatribe, so suffice it to say that Murrow (and Fred Friendly, et. al) was a beacon of sanity and reason at a time when paranoid delusions were becoming the national religion. (Any resemblance to the world today is purely coincidental............Yeah, right. Didn't Santayana remind us about those who fail to remember the past.....?)The film is not preachy or pushy, it lets the quiet determination of Murrow speak for itself. His name should be far better known than it is, and this film will help remedy that sorry situation. This is one of those films that remind us that it is not just soldiers who fight to defend our ideal of democracy - it is up to all of us to uphold that ideal in our everyday life. (And that is seldom easy.)Apart from the content, I also enjoyed the way the film was done. I grew up on black and white TV, and this film captures the feel of that, at least to some degree. The more I see of George Clooney's work, the more impressed I am. David Strathairn also did a remarkable job as Murrow. The stark shots, high contrast, and so on, were very effective, IMHO,  and the jazz breaks were great (including a nice, mellow cover of one of my favorite Les Paul and Mary Ford tunes, How High The Moon).The featurette on the making of the film was also very welcome. I like to have a ""behind the scenes"" view of the production, but with a film like this it becomes almost a necessity. The historical importance of the content alone merits that. It is billed as a docudrama, meaning that it is about historical incidents, but some of it is treated with a certain creative license, although not as much as usual in a Hollywood feature film. They made a point of trying very hard to stay factual. I intend to watch it again with the audio commentary turned on. That should also be interesting.If you are up for looking at, or thinking about, a very difficult period in our history, or if you are interested in seeing a small time capsule from the 50s (amazing how much people smoked),  or are interested in the role of media in democracy, I highly recommend you at least rent this, if not buy it, and support good film.",5,great film,1161129600,"10 18, 2006",2006,2432,"['Good', 'night', 'good', 'luckA', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'who', 'remember', 'McCarthy', 'days', 'more', 'importantly', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'must-see', 'very', 'short', 'hour', 'half', 'very', 'compelling', 'picture', 'very', 'dark', 'time', 'history', 'U.S', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bore', 'long', 'diatribe', 'suffice', 'say', 'Murrow', 'Fred', 'Friendly', 'et', 'al', 'was', 'beacon', 'sanity', 'reason', 'time', 'when', 'paranoid', 'delusions', 'were', 'becoming', 'national', 'religion', 'resemblance', 'world', 'today', 'purely', 'coincidental', 'Yeah', 'right', 'Did', ""n't"", 'Santayana', 'remind', 'who', 'fail', 'remember', 'past', '..', 'film', 'not', 'preachy', 'pushy', 'quiet', 'determination', 'Murrow', 'speak', 'name', 'should', 'be', 'far', 'better', 'known', 'film', 'will', 'help', 'remedy', 'sorry', 'situation', 'one', 'films', 'remind', 'not', 'just', 'soldiers', 'who', 'fight', 'defend', 'ideal', 'democracy', 'uphold', 'ideal', 'everyday', 'life', 'seldom', 'easy', 'Apart', 'content', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'done', 'grew', 'up', 'black', 'white', 'TV', 'film', 'feel', 'least', 'degree', 'more', 'see', 'George', 'Clooney', 'work', 'more', 'impressed', 'am', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'also', 'did', 'remarkable', 'job', 'Murrow', 'stark', 'shots', 'high', 'contrast', 'so', 'were', 'very', 'effective', 'IMHO', 'jazz', 'breaks', 'were', 'great', 'including', 'nice', 'mellow', 'cover', 'one', 'favorite', 'Les', 'Paul', 'Mary', 'Ford', 'How', 'High', 'Moon', '.The', 'featurette', 'making', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'welcome', 'like', 'have', 'scenes', 'view', 'production', 'film', 'almost', 'necessity', 'historical', 'importance', 'content', 'alone', 'billed', 'docudrama', 'meaning', 'about', 'historical', 'incidents', 'treated', 'certain', 'creative', 'license', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'feature', 'film', 'made', 'point', 'trying', 'very', 'hard', 'stay', 'factual', 'intend', 'watch', 'again', 'audio', 'commentary', 'turned', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'interesting.If', 'are', 'up', 'looking', 'thinking', 'about', 'very', 'difficult', 'period', 'history', 'are', 'interested', 'seeing', 'small', 'time', 'capsule', '50s', 'amazing', 'how', 'much', 'people', 'smoked', 'are', 'interested', 'role', 'media', 'democracy', 'highly', 'recommend', 'least', 'rent', 'not', 'buy', 'support', 'good', 'film']",N/A

Murrow.  He and his producer, Fred Friendly, played by George Clooney, take on a formidable foe when they attempt to uncover the unfair tactics used by Joseph McCarthy, the ""junior Senator from Wisconsin"", as Murrow calls him.  Looking back, people now say that the McCarthy Senate hearings were a ""witch hunt"" against anyone who had ever been allied with the Communist Party in any way.  At the time, the Senator struck fear and trembling into the hearts of many Hollywood movie actors, as well as everyday citizens who were called to defend themselves against the Senate Un-American Activities Committee.  Murrow and Friendly proceed with their journalistic truth-finding campaign, despite serious opposition from critics, viewers, and some higher-ups in CBS.  William Paley, network head, supports them as long as he can, but eventually capitulates from pressure put on him by sponsors and other foes of Murrow.  This is an interesting and important movie which perhaps could have been made clearer with a written statement at the end to tell what eventually happened to McCarthy and Murrow.",4,Learning from history,1144454400,"04 8, 2006",2006,1288,"['film', 'beautifully', 'atmosphere', '50', 'stark', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'smoke', 'constantly', 'swirls', 'head', 'shoulders', 'CBS', 'newsman', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'producer', 'Fred', 'Friendly', 'played', 'George', 'Clooney', 'take', 'formidable', 'foe', 'when', 'attempt', 'uncover', 'unfair', 'tactics', 'used', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'junior', 'Senator', 'Wisconsin', 'Murrow', 'Looking', 'back', 'people', 'now', 'say', 'McCarthy', 'Senate', 'hearings', 'were', 'witch', 'hunt', 'anyone', 'who', 'had', 'ever', 'been', 'allied', 'Communist', 'Party', 'way', 'time', 'Senator', 'struck', 'fear', 'trembling', 'hearts', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'everyday', 'citizens', 'who', 'were', 'called', 'defend', 'Senate', 'Un-American', 'Activities', 'Committee', 'Murrow', 'Friendly', 'proceed', 'journalistic', 'truth-finding', 'campaign', 'serious', 'opposition', 'critics', 'viewers', 'higher-ups', 'CBS', 'William', 'Paley', 'network', 'head', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'eventually', 'pressure', 'put', 'sponsors', 'other', 'foes', 'Murrow', 'interesting', 'important', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'clearer', 'written', 'statement', 'end', 'tell', 'what', 'eventually', 'happened', 'McCarthy', 'Murrow']",N/A

The film is a decent one, it tackles the whole event of senator Joe McCarthy's attack at communism. He basically turned and attacked everyone who opposed him and accused them of being communists.  Edward R. Murrow of CBS was the first person to attempt to oppose McCarthy. The film is basically an inside look at broadcast journalism in the 1950's.  This is where the film limits itself, and the result is that the film turns out to be very slow despite only being a little over than 90 minutes in running time.  I actually found myself admiring the interior design of the theater at Bethesda Row, because some scenes were just too boring.  The movie takes place entirely in the news studio, and is just the series of broadcasts that Murrow put on the air.  To put it simple, the film is something that the history channel might do.  You have zero character development, it's all happening in the moment, and it just never connects with the audience.  Sure there is witty dialogue now and then, but it really can't add anything to make the film interesting.  The b&w; style doesn't help either, I mean the plot is very basic and you have no depth in the characters and you go and shoot the film in black and white.  So, now the characters can't drive the plot and you can't make the film visually stimulating.  The film does hit hard with topics in broadcast journalism, and does relate to our media today.  It also suggest that the media is biased, which it is.  You'll get a different view watching FOX news versus NBC news.  The film only stands out with the actingACTING: David Strathairn steals the show as Murrow.  He is the focal point of the movie, and he does a great job with the character.  The film relys alot on facial expression, and a lot on the eyes of the actors.  There is a sense of anxiety and tension right before they go on the air with the famous report that exposed McCarthy.  The rest of the cast however is not that memorable, not even George could save his own film.  Strathairn will be nominated for this role come Golden Globes and Oscar, but this is not an award winning performance and he will not win.BOTTOM LINE: The film is a historical fluff piece that is pretty much a ""what you see is what you get"".  There is no depth to the film, nothing interesting for the audience to dig their teeth into.  You pretty much sit back and it's hand fed to you.  The film boasts a good leading performance, and nothing else.  They could have benefited from a musical score I can tell you that, you have no idea what a difference it would have made.",3,"Great Acting, But The Script Is A Little Dry",1133481600,"12 2, 2005",2005,2682,"['MOVIE', 'George', 'Clooney', 'sophmore', 'directoral', 'attempt', 'not', 'bad', 'one', 'really', 'much', 'great', 'one', 'film', 'decent', 'one', 'whole', 'event', 'senator', 'Joe', 'McCarthy', 'attack', 'communism', 'basically', 'turned', 'attacked', 'everyone', 'who', 'opposed', 'accused', 'being', 'communists', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'CBS', 'was', 'first', 'person', 'attempt', 'oppose', 'McCarthy', 'film', 'basically', 'inside', 'look', 'broadcast', 'journalism', '1950', 'where', 'film', 'result', 'film', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'slow', 'only', 'being', 'little', '90', 'minutes', 'running', 'time', 'actually', 'found', 'admiring', 'interior', 'design', 'theater', 'Bethesda', 'Row', 'scenes', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'boring', 'movie', 'place', 'entirely', 'news', 'studio', 'just', 'series', 'broadcasts', 'Murrow', 'put', 'air', 'put', 'simple', 'film', 'something', 'history', 'channel', 'might', 'do', 'have', 'zero', 'character', 'development', 'happening', 'moment', 'just', 'never', 'audience', 'Sure', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'now', 'then', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'make', 'film', 'interesting', 'b', 'w', 'style', ""n't"", 'help', 'either', 'mean', 'plot', 'very', 'basic', 'have', 'depth', 'characters', 'go', 'shoot', 'film', 'black', 'white', 'So', 'now', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'drive', 'plot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'visually', 'stimulating', 'film', 'hit', 'hard', 'topics', 'broadcast', 'journalism', 'relate', 'media', 'today', 'also', 'suggest', 'media', 'biased', ""'ll"", 'get', 'different', 'view', 'watching', 'FOX', 'news', 'versus', 'NBC', 'news', 'film', 'only', 'out', 'actingACTING', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'show', 'Murrow', 'focal', 'point', 'movie', 'great', 'job', 'character', 'film', 'relys', 'alot', 'facial', 'expression', 'lot', 'eyes', 'actors', 'sense', 'anxiety', 'tension', 'right', 'go', 'air', 'famous', 'report', 'exposed', 'McCarthy', 'rest', 'cast', 'however', 'not', 'memorable', 'not', 'even', 'George', 'could', 'save', 'own', 'film', 'Strathairn', 'will', 'be', 'nominated', 'role', 'come', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'Oscar', 'not', 'award', 'winning', 'performance', 'will', 'not', 'win.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'film', 'historical', 'fluff', 'piece', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'see', 'what', 'get', 'depth', 'film', 'nothing', 'interesting', 'audience', 'dig', 'teeth', 'pretty', 'much', 'sit', 'back', 'hand', 'fed', 'film', 'good', 'leading', 'performance', 'nothing', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'benefited', 'musical', 'score', 'can', 'tell', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'difference', 'would', 'have', 'made']",N/A

Hopefully, those who see this movie will see how easily attempts to make the world safer can be distorted and turned into witch hunts which target even the innocent, forcing friends to betray each other in an attempt to save themselves and  making the truth hard to decipher.What is fact? What is lie? How far will McCarthy go and what is his actual agenda? Does he care if the people he targets are truly guilty? These are questions at the heart of this movie.To Clooney's credit, he doesn't hammer home any parallels to the events in the movie and current day happenings. He allows viewers to make their own comparisons - or to interpret the movie as they will.Taken simply as a recap of a very critical moment in U.S. history, this movie stands on its own, allowing the very talented (but often underated) actor, David Straithairn, to shine in one of the best roles of his career, taking on none other than Joseph McCarthy. Straithairn's performance is worthy of an Academy nomination, as is this entire film.McCarthy, of course, had few limits on who he'd go after in his attempts to root out ""communists"" and was singlehandedly responsible for getting many talented people blacklisted, even if they were innocent of any wrongdoing.The film is shot in black and white, which lends a very believable historical tone to the movie. Because the hearings WERE shot in black and white, it echoes the reality of the time and doesn't come across as a gimmick.Clooney took care not to water down the details of history and to be as accurate as possible in recreating the actual events portrayed here. He has admitted that it was a labor of love and partially made as an homage to his father,( Nick Clooney)who was a radio journalist and often spoke to his son of the McCarthy trials. Luckily, the son paid attention to his father's message and took care to portray both Edward R. Murrow and Joseph MsCarthy with painstaking accuracy.",5,Not only timely but an amazingly accurate recreation of a critical event,1130544000,"10 29, 2005",2005,2012,"['arguably', 'very', 'timely', 'movie', 'considering', 'events', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'Hopefully', 'who', 'see', 'movie', 'will', 'see', 'how', 'easily', 'make', 'world', 'safer', 'can', 'be', 'distorted', 'turned', 'witch', 'hunts', 'target', 'even', 'innocent', 'forcing', 'friends', 'betray', 'other', 'attempt', 'save', 'making', 'truth', 'hard', 'decipher.What', 'fact', 'What', 'lie', 'How', 'far', 'will', 'McCarthy', 'go', 'what', 'actual', 'agenda', 'care', 'people', 'targets', 'are', 'truly', 'guilty', 'are', 'questions', 'heart', 'movie.To', 'Clooney', 'credit', ""n't"", 'hammer', 'home', 'parallels', 'events', 'movie', 'current', 'day', 'happenings', 'viewers', 'make', 'own', 'comparisons', 'interpret', 'movie', 'will.Taken', 'simply', 'recap', 'very', 'critical', 'moment', 'U.S.', 'history', 'movie', 'own', 'allowing', 'very', 'talented', 'often', 'underated', 'actor', 'David', 'Straithairn', 'shine', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'career', 'taking', 'none', 'other', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'Straithairn', 'performance', 'worthy', 'Academy', 'nomination', 'entire', 'film.McCarthy', 'course', 'had', 'few', 'limits', 'who', ""'d"", 'go', 'attempts', 'root', 'out', 'communists', 'was', 'singlehandedly', 'responsible', 'getting', 'many', 'talented', 'people', 'blacklisted', 'even', 'were', 'innocent', 'wrongdoing.The', 'film', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'very', 'believable', 'historical', 'tone', 'movie', 'hearings', 'WERE', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'reality', 'time', ""n't"", 'come', 'gimmick.Clooney', 'took', 'care', 'not', 'water', 'down', 'details', 'history', 'be', 'as', 'accurate', 'possible', 'recreating', 'actual', 'events', 'portrayed', 'here', 'admitted', 'was', 'labor', 'love', 'partially', 'made', 'homage', 'father', 'Nick', 'Clooney', 'who', 'was', 'radio', 'journalist', 'often', 'spoke', 'son', 'McCarthy', 'trials', 'Luckily', 'son', 'paid', 'attention', 'father', 'message', 'took', 'care', 'portray', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'Joseph', 'MsCarthy', 'painstaking', 'accuracy']",N/A
641736,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00005JOKM,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[4, 5]","Good Night, and Good Luck is a extraordinarily atmospheric and complex story of Edward R. Murrow's (David Strathairn) attempts to deliver the truth about Senator McCarthy.  It captures the time of the 1950s with meticulous detail through its superb mise-en-scene and scene framing.  However, it is essential for the film's success that director George Clooney captures the atmosphere of the 1950s in order to bring out the fear, escapism, and the need for happiness.  Some of this is also brought out through a poignant side story between actors Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson.  The black and white photography enhances the feeling that television brought the audience at the time.  The film is also well paced and chaptered by Dianne Reeves' singing performances, which allows the audience to reflect over the previous scenes.  In addition, the Oscar nominated script by Clooney and Grant Heslov provides the terrific cast with strong material to work with.  Clooney succeeds in bringing together all of these aspects of filmmaking into a truly brilliant cinematic experience.The American people have undergone their own times of Dark Ages, and the beginning of the 1950s is one such example when the republican U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy from Wisconsin led a witch-hunt on suspected Communists.  It led to a widespread fear that echoed throughout the United States that placed the very American idea of freedom under arrest.  Freedoms such as thinking, expressing oneself, and having opposing ideas came under strong scrutiny and assault, if they did not coincide with Senator McCarthy's view of what was American.  The fear caused a strong current of hysterical prejudice and moral panic to spread towards people with different ideas than Senator McCarthy.  Eventually, very few dared to say what was on his or her mind, as it could ultimately destroy their lives.The portion of society that bears the function of analyzing politicians, and sees to it that they do not step across the boundaries and break the laws is journalism.  The journalists report to the society about the political progress of the society, and they must have the freedom to freely expressing themselves.  Yet, Clooney makes it clear in Good Night, and Good Luck that this is not the case, as the opening crawling text enlightens the audience about the fear of retribution during the McCarthy years.  Instead many reporters were extremely cautious about what they reported to the public.  Naturally, it skewed the reporters' and publics' objectivity, as fear entered the very spirit of the American people.The opening montage of Good Night, and Good Luck displays a number of characters attending a formal banquet, as expensive jewelry and lavish outfits portray that these characters belong to one of society's successful groups.  They are laughing, drinking, and conversing freely without thought of who might be listening to their chatter.  Symbolically, the scene might display a notion of what the American Dream might look like through success.  In addition, it does provide an illustrious example of the American Dream, as it is a gathering to honor broadcast journalist Murrow in October 25, 1958.  However, his speech opens with words of warning of the escapism and societal decadence that emerge through widespread audience efforts to insulate themselves against uncomfortable information, as the people seek a pleasant existence while pursuing the American Dream.The forewarning by Murrow at the banquet offers an opportunity for audience to ponder about how history tends to repeat itself, if lessons from the past were not learned.  A fade out brings the speech to an abrupt end, as a flashback moves the story to October 14, 1953.  It is the final stages of Senator McCarthy's witch-hunt on Communists.  Meanwhile, in New York, Murrow and his producer Fred Friendly (George Clooney) approach a sensitive topic about a man fired from the Air Force for his father having read the wrong newspaper.  The Air Force also insisted that the man should denounce his father and sister, which the man refused.  At first, Fred is hesitant, as Senator McCarthy is not the one behind the Air Force decision.  However, they come to the understanding that the reverberation of McCarthyism seems to have caused the intimidating situation between the Air Force and the man.Unavoidably, Murrow and Fred eventually seek to tell the truth about the Wisconsin republican despite the possible the dangers of Senator McCarthy attacking them and CBS.  Yet, they intend to stay objective and keep it from personal attacks, as objectivity is essential to point out the shortcomings of Senator McCarthy.  Despite the objective truth, Murrow cannot help that his feelings of vulnerability and the obvious political bullying that McCarthy exercised affected his judgment.  In other words, to be objective with facts is next to impossible as there is a motivating factor to why people report news.  However, Clooney also extends this notion that it is the readers' responsibility to seek multiple sources for their information, as each source has some degree of distortion.  In the film, Murrow and his colleagues show this by reading multiple new paper reviews of their most recent production, as they report on McCarthyism and the red scare that flared up in the early 1950s.  In the end, Murrow's boss Mr.Paley (Frank Langella) even expresses to him that the most admirable and considerate of intentions have bias, as it wants to change something for the better.  Thus, they seek the public's approval of what they have accomplished through their criticism of Senator McCarthy.In Murrow's attempt to pursue the objective truth, the importance of financial and ideological backing emerge, as his boss Mr. Paley is concerned with CBS's future and its employees.  Mr. Paley must also take into account the vital importance of profiting in order to remain competitive.  CBS gets the competitive edge from revenues gathered from companies trying to sell the American Dream through commercials.  In the light of journalism, the audience gets to experience the difficult period that the people faced while trying to achieve the American Dream.  Meanwhile, Murrow's ideas often collide with those of the advertisers, which threaten the profit of the show . Simultaneously, other less meaningful shows make more profit while allowing the audience to escape the difficult times of the society.  (It is understandable why the people want to escape a society that constantly brings out bad news.)  Despite our differences, he learns that we all must live in symbiosis where freedom will prevail.  It is a message that suggests that differences of opinions never can be completely erased due to society's intricate web of different people.  It is something our forefathers are very well aware of, as they drafted and signed the living document Declaration of Independence.  Thus, the people must be aware of the political progress of the nation, as it concerns us all when our liberties are removed.Ultimately, it provides the audience with a remarkable cinematic experience that allows for a portrayal of some real life heroes that stood up and spoke against what was wrong within the society.  Much like Martin Luther King opposed laws that were unjust and created preferential treatment of the citizens within the nation, Murrow stood up and said his piece to help society better itself.  Good Night, and Good Luck provides a detailed look on heroes that stood up against what brought darkness on the American people, which offers both amusement and contemplation.",5,Extraordinarily

The movie is idealistic portrayal of what America is and stands for. It's all about that fundamental belief we have in doing the RIGHT thing in times that are difficult and hard... Murrow going head to head with McCarthy makes the movie enjoyable and appeal to everyone.The movie is nicely done the smoke and black & white effect give that true era feeling. Murrow is portrayed accurately and nicely not heroicially but as an average man trying to use his popular news show to do the right thing-in an era when the news was frequentally censored.Murrow's actions are viewed as a drop in the bucket...rather than, the changing point that it was in the McCarthy Era. The movie made me wish we had theose heroic human beings whose simple actions challenged the whole political system of America- especially in this day and age when so much of our country is being censored and where everyone is so scared to stand up to political giants- the movie in a sense comes along at the perfect time.Clooney has written a powerfully simply story, well-researchered, and brillantly directed. The movie is powerful in the simple American ideals we have that EVERYONE in someway can make a differance for that ""Good Night And Good Luck"" will not be forgotten.The editorials that Murrow gives are the most powerful part of the movie and made me personally reflect on current politics-foreign and domestic as it will you if you watch the movie...

Then finally as some kind of blessing my local Mr. Movies ran out of X-Men 3 and I found myself without a movie.  I browsed the aisles, but didn't find anything........then I saw it!  Good Night, and Good Luck.The reason I put off seeing it was because I was thinking, ""Hmmmmm.  Yeah.  Black and White.  Newsroom.  Exciting.  Nah.""  Surprisingly it was exciting, wonderfully acted, and well directed.  It was after all nominated for Best Picture(I still say Kong was screwed).  David Straithern is amazing as Edward R. Murrow.  I could go on and on about his performance, but you really have to watch him to really get it.  The rest of the cast is great too.  Clooney, Downey Jr., Langella, and all the others contribute a lot to its realism.  I also loved the fact that they used archivial footage for Senator Mcarthy.The scenes look great.  I mean for some of the shots I forgot this was made in 05'.  It sounded and looked like a 50s or 60s TV show(I love The Twilight Zone so I have some expierience in TV back then).Another surprise is Clooney's direction.  Its great.  I look forward to more movie by him.  Overall this is a great movie with noir, suspense, drama, and best of all passion.

641742,A2T049UQONS0OY,B00005JOKM,Larry VanDeSande,"[0, 2]","""Good Night and Good Luck"" was the tagline for CBS radio and, later, television journalist Edward R. Murrow, one of the pioneers of television journalism in the new medium of the post-World War II era. This film cleverly intersects reality and fantasy to portray a somewhat liberal Hollywood interpretation of events from 1953, a time when U.S. Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy from Wisconsin was being a demagogue, red-baiting and suggesting the American armed forces were full of communists. If you are too young to understand what the threat of being a communist was in 1953 America, think of it as being in league with Osama bin Laden and terrorism today.Using re-enactments and archival film footage, ""Good Night and Good Luck"" outlines Murrow's decision to take on McCarthy on ""See It Now,"" a CBS weeknight program of the era. This happened in real life, of course, when Murrow used the imagery of people's reputations being ruined by association with communism by third parties including McCarthy, who was also portrayed in caricature in the original 1962 film treatment ofThe Manchurian Candidate.While this film was given a boatload of Academy Award nominations, I can't say it is a great film. It is hardly even a fine one, in fact, for it takes itself too seriously and the direction by George Clooney -- who also plays Murrow's producer, the real-life Fred Friendly -- is deadly dull. The film moves at a steady snail's pace from beginning to end with little or no variance in texture or style. It is a monochromatic episode of American history that, under the hands of a more skillful exploiter such as Oliver Stone, could have been a riveting portrayal of the period.David Strathairn looks the part and is fine in the leading role of Murrow. He is supported by Clooney as his producer and Frank Langella as CBS chairman William Paley. The cast includes veteran actors Jeff Daniels, Patricia Clarkson and Robert Downey Jr. All are about about the same in this film -- undercharacterized, unchallenged and pretty much left to their own devices. Clooney, who loves to create films about the past, does not show himself a very good director here, by my reckoning.Still, there is value -- entertainment and historical -- in this movie. It portrays a time in American society somewhat similar to our own time when conformity was a requirement and it indicates the way politicians and political machinery exploit that conformity. It also shows the way the American news media once took on the establishment when it was depriving American citizens of due process and constitutional rights. It also tells you a little about the news and television business even if that window is superficial. The main point is to know and understand this battle of good vs. evil was once played out and good won -- to some extent. Murrow won the battle of hearts and minds over McCarthy, but his program was cancelled.",3,A little too serious and kind of a drag,1252108800,"09 5, 2009",2009,2898,"['Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'was', 'tagline', 'CBS', 'radio', 'later', 'television', 'journalist', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'one', 'pioneers', 'television', 'journalism', 'new', 'medium', 'post-World', 'War', 'II', 'era', 'film', 'cleverly', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'portray', 'somewhat', 'liberal', 'Hollywood', 'interpretation', 'events', '1953', 'time', 'when', 'U.S.', 'Sen.', 'Joseph', 'R.', 'McCarthy', 'Wisconsin', 'was', 'being', 'demagogue', 'red-baiting', 'suggesting', 'American', 'armed', 'forces', 'were', 'full', 'communists', 'are', 'too', 'young', 'understand', 'what', 'threat', 'being', 'communist', 'was', '1953', 'America', 'think', 'being', 'league', 'Osama', 'bin', 'Laden', 'terrorism', 'today.Using', 're-enactments', 'archival', 'film', 'footage', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'Murrow', 'decision', 'take', 'McCarthy', 'See', 'Now', 'CBS', 'weeknight', 'program', 'era', 'happened', 'real', 'life', 'course', 'when', 'Murrow', 'used', 'imagery', 'people', 'reputations', 'being', 'ruined', 'association', 'communism', 'third', 'parties', 'including', 'McCarthy', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'portrayed', 'caricature', 'original', '1962', 'film', 'treatment', 'ofThe', 'Manchurian', 'Candidate.While', 'film', 'was', 'given', 'boatload', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'great', 'film', 'hardly', 'even', 'fine', 'one', 'fact', 'too', 'seriously', 'direction', 'George', 'Clooney', 'who', 'also', 'Murrow', 'producer', 'real-life', 'Fred', 'Friendly', 'deadly', 'dull', 'film', 'moves', 'steady', 'snail', 'pace', 'beginning', 'end', 'little', 'variance', 'texture', 'style', 'monochromatic', 'episode', 'American', 'history', 'hands', 'more', 'skillful', 'exploiter', 'such', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'riveting', 'portrayal', 'period.David', 'Strathairn', 'part', 'fine', 'leading', 'role', 'Murrow', 'supported', 'Clooney', 'producer', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'CBS', 'chairman', 'William', 'Paley', 'cast', 'veteran', 'actors', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'All', 'are', 'same', 'film', 'undercharacterized', 'unchallenged', 'pretty', 'much', 'left', 'own', 'devices', 'Clooney', 'who', 'create', 'films', 'past', 'not', 'show', 'very', 'good', 'director', 'here', 'reckoning.Still', 'value', 'entertainment', 'historical', 'movie', 'time', 'American', 'society', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'own', 'time', 'when', 'conformity', 'was', 'requirement', 'way', 'politicians', 'political', 'machinery', 'exploit', 'conformity', 'also', 'way', 'American', 'news', 'media', 'once', 'took', 'establishment', 'when', 'was', 'depriving', 'American', 'citizens', 'due', 'process', 'constitutional', 'rights', 'also', 'little', 'news', 'television', 'business', 'even', 'window', 'superficial', 'main', 'point', 'know', 'understand', 'battle', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'was', 'once', 'played', 'out', 'good', 'won', 'extent', 'Murrow', 'won', 'battle', 'hearts', 'minds', 'McCarthy', 'program', 'was', 'cancelled']",N/A
641743,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JOKM,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 3]","Part of me is surprised that ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" was a theatrical film, because it struck me as being the sort of thing I would expect to see on HBO.  The 2005 Oscar nominated film only runs 93 minutes and most of the scenes take place in the intimacy of a television studio, so it would seem much better suited for the tube rather than the screen (my understanding is that George Clooney originally conceived of it as a live broadcast special on CBS).  Consequently I think it is probably more effective seeing it on DVD than in the movie theater.This is not a bio-pic, but a morality play.  So do not expect any scrawl at the end explaining what happened to Murrow, McCarthy and the rest of the characters (the film implicitly says ""shame on you"" if you do not know already).  It is about the events leading up to and the aftermath of the March 9, 1954 broadcast of a ""See It Now"" special entitled ""A Report on Senator Joseph McCarthy,"" put together by Murrow (David Strathairn) and producer Fred Friendly (Clooney).  Three weeks later McCarthy was given an opportunity to refute the charges on the show, but instead resorted to his standard practice of denouncing anybody who dared to attack him, essentially completing the job that Murrow had begun.  However, the victory Murrow and Friendly won did not come without a cost, as see in the tragic story of Don Hollenbeck (Ray Wise) and the decisions CBS chairman William S. Paley (Frank Langella) made regarding the future of Murrow on television based on economic considerations.""Good Night, and Good Lucky"" makes a series of strategic stories to tell the story.  First, because all of the appearances of Murrow and McCarthy on television were in black & white, the entire film ends up being done that way.  There are several points where Clooney plays wih cuts and changing the rack focus to shift from seeing Murrow directly and on television, and that works better when everything is in black & white.  Second, instead of an actor playing Senator McCarthy, Clooney uses actual footage.  After all, that was what Murrow did on his broadcast, letting McCarthy speak for himself.  But this also has an advantage because anyone playing the junior Senator from Wisconsin trying to do for him what Strathairn is doing for Murrow is going to look like a clown.Third, obviously McCarthy is saying what McCarthy really said, but as when Murrow is on camera the script sticks to what he really said as well.  Some of the key things Murrow said off camera are considered to be authentic as well, and most viewers will be able to appreciate that simply because they will have a real sense of Murrow's use of language and the rhythm of his speech.  There are liberties taken with chronology, collapsing the time frame as to when things happened without changing the order (as near as I can tell), but avoiding subtitles constantly telling us the date is fine with me.  Also, Clooney softens the direct and rather documentary-like approach by bridging the major acts of the film with songs sung in the studio next door by jazz singer Dianne Reeves.  The songs do not offer any sort of musical counterpoint to the narrative, but beyond being a homage to Clooney's aunt they also give a sense of the time and give the director an opportunity to be artistic and justify his Oscar nomination in that category.Of course, the release of this film at this time makes it political, because we are again living in a time when there are elements of the government justifying their actions in the name of national security.  The film explicitly condemns McCarthy, but then it implicitly attacks not only Bush, but Reagan and Nixon (It is not that the film is inherently anti-Republican, but rather than only Republicans get to cloak their actions in the blanket of national security; Democrats on soft on things like defense).  Getting the communists is not that different from getting the terrorists or considering all dissent to be by definition un-American.  Once again, the more things change the more they remain the same.However, ultimately the main indictment of ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is not of politicians, who we know full well will lie to us in the name of self-interest and maintaining power.  Rather the harshest critique is for the television news of today, where the vast majority of reporters are unwilling to stand up to power and, even more damningly, unwilling to tell the truth.  The framing device for the film is Murrow's keynote address to the 1958 convention of the Radio-Television News Directors Association, and his withering critique of the medium that he used so well.  If Murrow were alive today and not constantly spinning in his grave, I have no doubt that he would be saving his most withering comments for his fellow journalists, not that any of them today are really in his class.Here is a really scary thought.  Look at the talking heads on television today who are most famous and ask yourself: do they remind you more of Edward R. Murrow or of Senator Joseph McCarthy?",5,Edward R.

Murrow and his crusade against the ravings of Senator Joe McCarthy has the look and feel of one of those creepy film noirs of the the era. Filmed in lush black and white, and with a sassy jazz score (chanteuse Dianne Reeves is featured), the cigarette-smoke-filled movie works like a ""making of"" documentary--but one filmed more than 50 years after the fact, and with 20-20 hindsight--of Murrow's weekly ""See It Now"" programs, beginning in the fall of 1953, when Murrow decided to go after the Junior Senator from Wisconsin.Clooney has cast the film brilliantly: he himself plays Morrow's producer, Fred Friendly; Frank Langella suavely plays Bill Paley, CEO of CBS; and Robert Downey is fine as a member of Murrow's staff, secretly married to another staff member, Patricia Clarkson, in a rather unnecessary subplot that nevertheless allows Downey to provide some spark.And then there's Murrow, played magnificiently by David Strathairn. Lean and vulpine faced, he seems to have let Murrow's ghost inhabit him.And then there's McCarthy. In a brilliant move by Clooney (and maybe it would have been impossible to find a suitable impersonator) he is seen only in old tapes. You'll watch fascinated at the charlatan self-described exposer of communists in government, as he huffs and puffs, blusters and bullies, with a maniacal glint in his eye--until he's brought down.The film isn't without irony: in the end McCarthy's day was done, thanks in great part to Murrow--although McCarthy himself aided in his own downfall by overreaching, famously falling into a trap set for him by attorney Joe (""At Last Sir Have You No Decency?"") Welsh. He was censured but he remained in the Senate. Murrow, however, also overreached--Paley had enough of his hectoring and stubbornness and cancelled ""See It Now,"" banishing Murrow to five Sunday-afternoon documentaries per year. When in the film Murrow objects, claiming his show was cheap to produce even though he had lost his sponsor, an aluminum company, Paley informs him that ""The $64,000 Question,"" which would soon meet its own demise during the quiz show scandal era, costs less, and is sponsored.The film ends, as it begins, with the concluding remarks of Murrow's hectoring speech complaining of the banality of TV at a testimonial dinner to him in 1958. By then McCarthy was dead, Murrow a historical footnote. Clooney (and Strathairn) deserve our thanks for bringing him back to life.",4,History Noir,1148774400,"05 28, 2006",2006,2488,"['George', 'Clooney', 'biopic', 'tribute', 'newscaster', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'crusade', 'ravings', 'Senator', 'Joe', 'McCarthy', 'look', 'feel', 'one', 'creepy', 'film', 'noirs', 'era', 'Filmed', 'lush', 'black', 'white', 'sassy', 'jazz', 'score', 'chanteuse', 'Dianne', 'Reeves', 'featured', 'cigarette-smoke-filled', 'movie', 'making', 'documentary', 'one', 'filmed', 'more', '50', 'years', 'fact', '20-20', 'hindsight', 'Murrow', 'weekly', 'See', 'Now', 'programs', 'beginning', 'fall', '1953', 'when', 'Murrow', 'decided', 'go', 'Junior', 'Senator', 'Wisconsin.Clooney', 'cast', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'Morrow', 'producer', 'Fred', 'Friendly', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'suavely', 'Bill', 'Paley', 'CEO', 'CBS', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'fine', 'member', 'Murrow', 'staff', 'secretly', 'married', 'staff', 'member', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'rather', 'unnecessary', 'subplot', 'nevertheless', 'allows', 'Downey', 'provide', 'spark.And', 'then', 'Murrow', 'played', 'magnificiently', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'Lean', 'vulpine', 'faced', 'have', 'let', 'Murrow', 'ghost', 'inhabit', 'him.And', 'then', 'McCarthy', 'brilliant', 'move', 'Clooney', 'maybe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'impossible', 'find', 'suitable', 'impersonator', 'seen', 'only', 'old', 'tapes', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'fascinated', 'charlatan', 'self-described', 'exposer', 'communists', 'government', 'puffs', 'blusters', 'bullies', 'maniacal', 'glint', 'eye', 'brought', 'down.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'irony', 'end', 'McCarthy', 'day', 'was', 'done', 'thanks', 'great', 'part', 'Murrow', 'McCarthy', 'aided', 'own', 'downfall', 'overreaching', 'famously', 'falling', 'trap', 'set', 'attorney', 'Joe', 'Last', 'Sir', 'Have', 'No', 'Decency', 'Welsh', 'was', 'censured', 'remained', 'Senate', 'Murrow', 'however', 'also', 'overreached', 'Paley', 'had', 'enough', 'hectoring', 'stubbornness', 'cancelled', 'See', 'Now', 'banishing', 'Murrow', 'five', 'Sunday-afternoon', 'documentaries', 'year', 'When', 'film', 'Murrow', 'claiming', 'show', 'was', 'cheap', 'produce', 'even', 'had', 'lost', 'sponsor', 'aluminum', 'company', 'Paley', '64,000', 'Question', 'would', 'soon', 'meet', 'own', 'demise', 'quiz', 'show', 'scandal', 'era', 'costs', 'sponsored.The', 'film', 'ends', 'concluding', 'remarks', 'Murrow', 'hectoring', 'speech', 'complaining', 'banality', 'TV', 'testimonial', 'dinner', '1958', 'then', 'McCarthy', 'was', 'dead', 'Murrow', 'historical', 'footnote', 'Clooney', 'Strathairn', 'deserve', 'thanks', 'bringing', 'back', 'life']",N/A

And I can also understand why it didn't win.Good Night, and Good Luck is what is referred to as a ""docu-drama"".  Most of it is true, based on newscasts and other history.  It is set in the 1950s, during the era of Communist witch-hunting by Joseph E McCarthy.  Edward R. Murrow, a well known news anchor at the time for CBS was instrumental in bringing McCarthy down.  And the theme of the film is how the determination of one man to tell the truth can make a major difference in history.  This is a lesson that is as true today as it ever was.  And George Clooney, who was instrumental in bringing this film to the screen can be thanked for it.Edward R. Murrow is played by David Strathairn.  He plays this role with a great deal of understatement and intelligence.  Even though he doesn't quite look like Edward R. Morrow, he absolutely captures his spirit.  Hats off to him for doing so.  George Clooney wrote, directed and also acted in the film in the part of Fred Friendly, a producer at CBS.  His acting is fine as well, but it is in his directing that he shines.  First of all, he chose to shoot the whole film in black and white.  This really gives it the film of old-time television.  Also, in order to bring the times to life, he has all of his characters smoking cigarettes, all the time.  And there just is just the right amount of irony in the fact that the CBS people were courageous in combating McCarthy, but probably never realized how they were being manipulated by the cigarette industry.This is a good film.  It has a lot to say.  But I couldn't help it; it put me to sleep.  Too much talk, very subtle action, if any, and it took a lot of concentration to follow it all.The DVD has some extras with interviews of some of the people who were involved in CBS in the 1950s.

The movie reflects more on the character issue of Murrow and his reaction to McCarthy's antics and actions which he believes to be bad for our nation. Historically speaking, Murrow entered the fray against McCarthy late in the game but his intervention proves to be highly effective in the domino effects that led to the downfall of Joseph McCarthy.The movie proves to be well acted, directed and written. Shot in black and white, it captured the period era perfectly. David Strathairn who played Edward R. Murrow captured his character perfectly and the entire movie centered around him as Joseph McCarthy was only shown in real life tape. George Clooney who co-wrote, directed and acted in this movie does his job superbly well and the movie proves to be well supported by excellent supporting actors/actresses like Frank Lanagella, Robert Downy, Patricia Clarkson and Ray Wise.The movie however, may not be for everyone. The pacing is bit slow and very deliberate. No one get killed, no sex or does anything get blown up. The movie reflects on the lead character, Edward R. Murrow as he dwelled on the consequences of his actions as he decides to take on Joseph McCarthy, who at that time was America's most feared man.Some people have regarded this movie as stand against the current Patriot Acts in trying to connect McCarthyism to the Patriot Acts. However, any well educated individual on American history knows that comparing the two would be like comparing apple with a pineapple.There is awful lot of smoking in this movie which reflects the time period.

Quido ""quidrock""","[124, 155]","Black and white, and set in 50's America, ""Good Night and Good Luck"" is the sign off slogan of one of America's greatest journalists and early television pioneers, Edward R. Murrow.  Murrow made his bones in WWII as a correspondent, and continued with a distinguished career as a journalist and radio/television newsman at CBS in the 50's and early 60's.""Good Night and Good Luck"" is a jewel of a film for the history buff who still shakes their head at the paranoia and all encompassing aspects of the McCarthy witch hunt in the 50's.  I think you just had to be alive then, and feeling the fear we all felt of the Cold War and the specter of Communism, to understand how this land could have been misled and led by the nose thanks to the ""junior Senator from Wisconsin"".Some reviewers say that the clash between Murrow and McCarthy, between a free television press and television that is simply an entertainment venue, is as engrossing for those who aren't fully aware of that era of our history, as it is for those of us who lived then.  Perhaps, but I think not.  Part of what makes the film a success is the director's infallible instinct in recreating the 50's...from the prevalence of smoking to the clothes, sets and dialogue of those who lived through the era.What a marvelous piece of imagery it was to utilize only filmclips of McCarthy in the movie, instead of getting an actor's portrayal.  With this film, Geoge Clooney fully establishes himself as a force to be reckoned with, in filmmaking.  Directing, assisting with the script, and acting the part of Edward R. Murrow's boss, Fred Friendly.  The film is terse and pointed, perhaps more suited to a venue like HBO than it is to the movie house, and while it boasts a strong message in today's media bashing climate, and some incredibly strong performances, it still lacks that indefinable something that makes a fine film a great one.Perhaps it is the lack of the human spark in the characters.  The romance of two of CBS' staffers, the Wershbas (Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson) is little more than a sidebar.  And while the faceoff between CBS' owner, William Paley (Frank Langella in a dynamic return to drama) and Murrow is not for the faint of heart, it is still cold and calculated.  Some of the emotion is missing.  Thus, the suicide role for television announcer Don Hollenbeck (Ray Wise) is more matter of fact than heartbreaking.Clooney is fine in his role and the supporting cast, including television actors Tate Donovan and Reed Diamond, do excellent work.  But any review of this film pales without the mention of David Strathairn as Edward R. Murrow.  Deciding, at the risk of his own career, to take McCarthy on, Murrow was a quiet symbol of what is great in America.  As Murrow, Strathairn is eerily a recreation of the man himself, with the quiet, convincing style that belies a man of impeccable reputation.  Strathairn is a bit of a journeyman, with a long history of memorable small parts.  You may not even remember him in L.A. Confidential, in The Firm, in The River Wild, or over the course of a 25 year film career.  You remember you've seen him before, but you can't remember where.  Less easy to forget is his memorable turn as Robert ""Bob"" Wegler, A.J.'s guidance counselor in the 2004 run of ""The Sopranos"".  As Bob, Strathairn was far less interested in helping A.J. than he was in bedding Carmela, which he did in a delicious turn of events on the show.As Murrow, Strathairn has come into his own as an actor; he is a quiet force on the screen, the reincarnation of the newsman.  Affable and steely, he makes you believe in his cause, which is not bringing down Joe McCarthy, but rather bringing up the quality of the television industry, to make it more than just another entertainment venue.  Clooney chose well when he chose Strathairn, and the actor's passion and intensity shines through in the role.  I suppose there may be a better turn in a leading actor's role in film this year, but at this point, I have not seen any.For the serious film buff, ""Good Night and Good Luck"" is being shown in limited release around the country, and will not win the hearts and minds of many who go to films to be strictly entertained.  The message is too intense, the film too understated for most.  However, it is among the very best in films released this year, and while somewhat emotionless for the audience, one can tell that it was a labor of love for the filmmakers.In a sidebar, the clips of songstress Diane Reeves singing 50's jazz between interludes was incredibly enjoyable!If only they could have found a way to include my favorite Murrow quote about television:""If we were to do the Second Coming of Christ in color for a full hour, there would be a considerable number of stations which would decline to carry it on the grounds that a Western or a quiz show would be more profitable.""",4,Bodes well for Clooney's future behind the camera!,1131235200,"11 6, 2005",2005,4896,"['Black', 'white', 'set', '50', 'America', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'sign', 'slogan',

This film chronicles the short period of time where Edward R. Murrow attacked Senator Joseph McCarthy. During this same period the junior Senator was using unwarranted tactics to ferret out communist in America. The movie makes it look like Mr. Murrow was responsible for the Senate investigation of Senator McCarthy and that is not true. President Eisenhower and the U.S. Army have that honor.Edward R. Murrow was one of American television's most famous journalists and worked for CBS Television. The movie shows how the social contract that the broadcasting companies had with America started to change. Mr. Murrow, who was a great journalist, decided to use his show for his chosen agenda and began to editorialize instead of report the news. Yet Mr. Murrow was always careful with his facts and performed his due diligence, which was part of his past journalist training.But the movie does not point out the facts that there are numerous records of communist spies in America at the time and attempts the point that McCarthy was wrong at all points and the attempt to divulge communist activity in America was useless and wrong for civil liberties. Though everyone does have the right to face his or her accuser, history proved McCarthy correct about his assertion of communist infiltration into our very government.We should all demand that our journalist should have the integrity, zeal for truth and refusal top pander to the all mighty dollar. This is the era where the mainstream media started its long decline to where it is today. Hopefully this film will open debate today on journalistic integrity. Mr. Murrow had it, even when editorializing. Integrity in reporting is something that seems to be missing from the network news today. And I use the term news lightly, for they seem more interested in ratings and the mighty dollar then in objective reporting.

(And, for that matter, Frank Langella and Robert Downey Jr.) But this movie didn't live up to my expectations. The acting was good, not great; so too the writing.  It demonized Joe McCarthy, but not to the degree I expected--no more so than our generation's take on the Red-baiting/blacklisting of the 1950's.The producers, after all, are products of the mindset that anyone in McCarthy's crosshairs was, indeed, a victim. Yes, McCarthy was dumb to go after little fish that may or may not have attended suspect meetings...but McCarthy's concern about Communists was right on the money. We tend to think of card-carrying Communists as members of a benign, slightly kooky social club. Actually, hard-core Communists were dedicated to replacing our form of government with a Soviet model, and we all know how well that worked out. These guys were serious. Murrow deserves credit for insisting on accountability, and proof, before accusations are made and careers ruined. But a lot of people who were blacklisted have admitted to participating in activities that would have had them shipped to a gulag under different circumstances.The only real dramatic tension this movie ever sustained was the issue of Hollenbeck.  This isn't really a PLOT SPOILER, because this guy, from the moment he appears on screen, might just as well have been wearing a sign that said, ""SUICIDE COMING UP SOON."" You just KNOW he's going to off himself, and when he shows up in subsequent scenes it's kind of a relief....but then the tension builds again. Until finally, his colleagues receive the news that SHOCKS them.  (""Oh my God, how horrible! I mean, he told us his wife left him and he had nothing to live for, but...!"")The black-and-white format was, I guess, indicated for this movie's ""mood.""

641763,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00005JOKM,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 2]","Good Night, and Good Luck tells us the gripping true story of how famed television journalist Edward R. Murrow (played so well by David Strathairn) dared to speak against the over-zealous and ferocious anti-Communist Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy (seen here in black and white newsreel clips to make this film feel all the more real). The cinematography is excellent and David Strathairn does a superlative job of portraying the nervous yet very brave Murrow; and the plot moves along at a very good pace. Look also for a strong performance by Ray Wise as Don Hollenbeck; and Frank Langella is completely convincing as CBS top man Bill Paley.When the action starts, we see a banquet to honor Edward R. Murrow in 1958; and when Murrow begins to speak the story begins in flashback form. We see the tensions of a bustling, mightily busy newsroom at CBS; and it's not long before we see Edward Murrow and his ""partner"" Fred Friendly (George Clooney). Fred produces Murrow's TV shows; and Murrow often confides in Fred as well. Murrow begins to be appalled at the actions of Senator McCarthy and wants to expose him as a master of manipulation and terror who wants to expose ""Communists"" even if the person never was a Communist.It isn't easy. You probably know how the story goes and what the ending will be; but that doesn't keep you from being rivted to your seat in anticipation of the next twist and turn in the story. Eventually McCarthy comes on Murrow's show to offer his rebuttal--but the outcome of that is clear especially in hindsight.The film is shot in black and white which heightens its artistic qualities; the choice of black and white also highlights the darkness of McCarthy's soul and the nervous tension and paranoia McCarthyism caused. Black and white was a brilliant choice for this picture. The close-ups of David Strathairn as Edward R. Murrow do a marvelous job of showing just how much anxiety Murrow had--but Murrow goes through with it all anyway because he believed in what he was doing and he believed that he was right. Fortunately, Murrow had his producer/friend Fred Friendly on his side; although there are some unpleasant encounters with Bill Paley who must manage profitability.Look also for the great Dianne Reeves to sing a number of stellar ballads throughout this movie. The sound track should be available on CD if you're interested. In addition, the DVD comes with a ""companion piece"" which is essentially a short ""making of"" featurette; and we get an optional running commentary by Director/Writer George Clooney and Co-Writer/Producer Grant Heslov as well. Excellent!I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in this movie; and students of 20th century American history will find this to be a fascinating film.

That period was covered in a class on documentary film that I took many years ago as an undergraduate. So, I've seen the full episodes of Murrow's challenge, McCarthy's attack on Murrow, and Murrow's response.McCarthy overreached when he went after the Army. And Murrow, I have learned from other sources, waited until McCarthy was politically wounded before challenging him. These elements are missing from the film. My guess is they were omitted to avoid boring the audience.For those with no experience with McCarthyism, the film may be boring anyway as some have already commented.However, like Arthur Miller's play, The Crucible, which set McCarthyism in the time frame of the Salem witch trial hysteria, this film does a decent job of portraying the atmosphere of fear engendered by continual hysterical threats to the personal safety of the American people from within or from without.

Murrow (David Strathairn) and his team to expose the irregular methods senator Joseph McCarthy used to fight communism. That took courage, specially in the 50's, a time when the fear of Communism was pervasive and McCarthy had helped to create a climate of paranoia in which disagreeing with him immediately led to accusations of being a Communist.Murrow and his producer and partner, Fred Friendly (George Clooney) decided to take this matter in their hands when faced with a case that, even though not involving McCarthy directly, was an excellent example of the climate of fear the nation was living in. The following step was to attack McCarthy's methods, using the senator`s own words and footage of audiences of the Committee McCarthy presided. Murrow pointed truths that many had forgotten, that is, that accusation is not proof, and that ""We cannot defend freedom abroad by disserting it at home"". He also made his viewers remember that ""We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. When the loyal opposition dies, I think the soul of America dies with it"".""Good night and good luck"" was directed by George Clooney, and based on a script he cowrote with Grant Heslov. In my opinion, it is a truly outstanding film. Of course, it is entertaining, and has a superb cast. But the real reason why you really should watch this movie is that it brings home some important lessons about responsibility, the responsibility of journalists but also that of citizens.

Clooney, Robert Downey Jr., Patricia Clarkson, Frank Lagella, and Jeff Daniels are excellent in their supporting roles, but this movie belongs to David Strathairn.

The movie was the brainchild of George Clooney (who was a journalism major in college) and Grant Heslov.  They wrote the screenplay together, using much of the stock footage from the confrontation in the news archives, then Clooney acted and directed.  The story starts at a dinner honoring Murrow, then segues into the fight with McCarthy.  Murrow argues with CBS executive to cover a story about Milo Radulovic, a United States Air Force officer who was thrown out of the service after McCarthy accused Radulovic's father of being a spy.  The events, and the movie, escalate from there.  They also include the secret marriage of two CBS employees and a news anchorman driven to take his own life.George Clooney is one of the top-grossing leading men in the film industry today.  After starting out on a television sit-com, he moved into ER, then took off in the movies.  Edward R. Murrow was a reknowned journalist who first caught the public's attention while doing World War II broadcasts from London during the air raid days.GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK is a thoroughly gripping tale that doesn't miss a beat.  Even though Murrow's personal life isn't explored, the black-and-white imagery is evocative of the times (much of it shopped in later through computer graphics).  I'd expected an easy walkthrough, something that would occupy time but not necessarily my attention.  I was surprised.  Even though I knew how everything turned out from journalism classes of my own, I was still gripped by the stories spinning out.  The black-and-white release was absolutely stunning.  Cigarette smoke seemed to hang in every scene.Looking back on the film now, I wish it had broadened the scope a little and shown what the Red Scare truly did to so many people.  McCarthy didn't create the paranoia, but he certainly wielded it like a blunt instrument.Future journalism students will probably what the film in class after class, just as they do CITIZEN KANE.  But Clooney and Heslov scripted a masterpiece that rightfully earned six Academy Award nominations, including best picture.

641770,AWOSS0OBKHTJC,B00005JOKM,"Michael F. Hopkins ""A Deeper Groove""","[2, 3]","(from an earlier article, copyright 2005 Michael F. Hopkins)Anyone who still holds that GeorgeClooney is a pretty boy celebritylacking artistic talent or aestheticvirtue will find their opinionslacking merit once they've seenthis film.With GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK,Clooney steps up the challenge,delivering one of the greatmotion pictures of this era,or any other.As director, co-writer, and castmember, Clooney stakes hiscredentials as a majorindependent filmmaker, choosingto make a Black and White filmon one of the most pivotalmoments in the history ofthis nation, a major milestonein the annals of Journalismas a whole.In this current era, where civilliberties are too often takenfor granted, callously discarded,or ruthlessly violated, a filmabout television commentatorEdward R. Murrow's battleagainst the fascist demagogueryof McCarthyism could not be moretimely, or more appropriate.A lifetime of covering an arrayof topics taught Ed Murrow thevalue of responsibility inreporting news, and makingjournalistic evaluations  -notbiased opinionations-  whenthe need arose. Fallacies ofobjectivity and subjectivityfaded before the centralfocus and professional callof fair play.The need for such intelligencein a medium already known formass idiocy was the point ofMurrow's famous October 1958speech in Chicago, before aconvention of television andradio broadcasters.It remains one of the mostpowerful and propheticstatements ever made onthe potential of televison,and the decay of mediocritythat it would fall into notlong after.Excerpts from that speechare concisely edited byco-scripters Clooney andproducer Grant Heslov,and are soberly enactedto form the memorablebookends of this film.Immediately, one sensesthe exacting skill by whichClooney, cast and crew haveconceived this film.You're summarily whiskedinto a different world,as the Black and Whiteimagery of cinematographerRobert Elswit conveys acomplex mastery of depthand dimension which beliesthe flat illusions of lifeand community that the boxinsistently churns out.Within a sea of manneredprogramming conveyinglittle or less of anygenuine manners whatsoever,the film takes you intothe day-by-day of a smallEditorial team co-led byCBS producer Fred Friendly(a splendidly understatedClooney) and commentatorMurrow (David Strathairn.The story which ensues isnicely sequenced by thetwilight moods of a Jazzensemble jamming cool,and on the One.Featuring noted vocalistDianne Reeves marvelouslysinging the most authenticJazz of her illustriouscareer, the ensemble actsas a latter-day GreekChorus, its songs astutelyunderlying the inevitabilityof all that goes down; attimes reflecting ironicallyupon the prices to be paidfor what is to come.A pair is seen talkingabout oaths of loyalty andthe intimidation it couldrepresent, even as thispair (played handsomelyby Patricia Clarkson andRobert Downey Jr.) holdsa secret representing anequally absurd socialmandate of the day.We will see a localcommentator (exceptionallyrendered by Ray Wise)whose personal strife andprofessional choices arebeing targeted by viciouscolumnists bearingprejudiced viewpointsfueled by vestedinterests.We note Sig Mickelson(chumminess and apprehensionblended well by Jeff Daniels),who balanced Editorial writand Corporate whim on thehead of a pin. We encounterCBS Chairman William S. Paley(brooding and imperious assuperbly conveyed by FrankLangella), whose legacy wouldcontain some of Television'shighest glories, as well asmany of the medium's basestbetrayals.Against this tapestry oflivelihoods and pursuits, thespecter of finger-pointingparanoia looms like a distantnightmare, creeping ever closerwith each moment.It takes the editorial perspectivewhich Murrow delivers, in questioningthe persecution of a soldier overimagined Communist associations,to drive home the totalitarianpractices running rampant asgovernmental policy for ademocratic society.Slowly, methodically, carefully,lines are decisively drawn.Not enough superlatives canbe utilized to describe themagnificent performance ofDavid Strathairn as thelegendary Dean of BroadcastJournalism. The acclaimedcharacter actor is cunningin capturing Murrow's mix ofcalmly-toned, straight-shootinghonor, campfire wisdom andsharp-eyed wiliness whichmade his broadcastingstand out above the packof hard-bitten, carny-barking,sound-chomping Walter Winchellacolytes.Not only does Strathairn conveythe dignity of Murrow's linguisticdynamics with formidable precision;he hits the commentator's strongethical beliefs  -and vulnerabilities,as well-  with a quiet fire whichbuilds from smouldering ember toignite and illuminate the entirescreen. A performance for the ages.With such performances andcraftsmanship marking thiscompelling  drama, GOOD NIGHT,AND GOOD LUCK is furtherdistinguished by thedocumentary atmosphereinfused within its subtlely-placed, expressly thespiandemeanor.The SECTION EIGHT production'susage of actual McCarthy footage,interposed within the expertlyenacted tableau, brings thereality of its deadly subjectdead-on home.As the Warner Bros. DVD aptlyreflects, Clooney and Heslovdrew input from very reliablesources; two of whom are enactedin the film, while another isshown in actual 1953 news footage.All, with the children of Murrowand Friendly, offer incisiveperspectives in the CompanionPiece, the DVD's invaluable insidelook at the film.Time has certainly verified thedire predictions made by Murrowconcerning the bottomless pitthat Television could  -and has-become. The overall decline ofbroadcast journalism, too oftenoverrun by gossip column punditsand ambulance chasers today, isa stark contrast to the perceptivecommentary of Ed Murrow, ChetHuntley, Walter Cronkite, PeterJennings, Jane Pauley and otherpioneers who reported with thoroughdeliberation, human consideration,and a rounded insight which broughtit all together.Nor has its print counterpart faredany better. Too many newspapers andnews periodicals find their Editorialpolicies dictated by their Addepartments.At its absolute worst, such a lackwitabsence of principle is reflected intoday's proliferation of blurb-happycheat sheets which grudgingly allowan infrequent paragraph or two tojustify its status as a journalisticforum.Yet, if this has done incalculable harmto the practice of authentic journalismregarding issues and policies, the harminflicted upon authentic coverage of Arts,Music, and Culture has proven far worse.In most cases, expect Arts Journalism tobe relegated to the print ghetto of theweekend entertainment section for majorpapers; meager lip service in the majorityof glossed-over magazines and ego-happytabloids purporting to represent the voiceof the Arts, let alone the will of thepeople.Far too often, raging stereotypes of thebuffoon-acting fop, the edge-crazednihilist, the bored easygoer and thesneering revisionist find easy accessto podiums of aesthetic reporting;positions of responsibility that fewin play  -today-  have earned, and evenfewer deserve.Were noted critics and civic spokesmenNat Hentoff, Ralph Wiley or Thulani Davisto start their world-renowned careerstoday, each might be judged toolong-winded by the interests who findthe over-abbreviated nature of manyWeb critics to be the model exampleof how to ""sell a subject"".Langston Hughes or Ralph J. Gleasonwould doubtlessly be told that theirprecedent-setting forms of analyticaladvocacy are far too ""esoteric"" to beconsidered applicable in a professionalmarket which largely considers the Artsa barely tolerable curiosity... or adecadent luxury.Clearly, the points raised by GOOD NIGHT,AND GOOD LUCK address every facet ofJournalism, what it's supposed to standfor, and what it sorely lacks in much ofAmerica today. It's an unmistakablegauntlet to every citizen, from all walksof life, to stand firm and be counted forwhat's ethical and best.For each and every person purporting tobe a journalist, the mandate is to bringa balanced, fair, informed perspectiveto bear upon these turbulent, uninformedtimes. Now, as if was in the 1950s, themessage is clear. The choice awaits.Even the title of one game show calledit straight.Shall it be Truth?Or Consequences...",5,The Value Of The Town Crier.,1142726400,"03 19, 2006",2006,8141,"['earlier', 'article',

641771,AL4MKKO24563R,B00005JOKM,Michael K. Beusch,"[15, 20]","An Amazon reviewer recently wrote a review claiming that everyone investigated by Joseph McCarthy was a bona fide communist spy. Another brought up the Alger Hiss case as if finding one communist spy justified the wholesale trashing of civil rights and privacy. Such ignorance of the truth shows just why we need a film like George Clooney's Good Night, and Good Luck now more than ever. Joe McCarthy was a demagogue who exploited hysteria over communism to crush civil liberties, spread ridiculous lies and destroy lives. Anyone who even offered support to an American suspected of communist ties often lost their jobs and were shunned by their friends and family. McCarthy played fast and loose with the facts as evidenced by his list of alleged communists in the State Department -- the number of names changing from speech to speech. That the right wing still clings to the ridiculous myth that McCarthy was some kind of hero shows what a hypocritical lot they are. It's interesting that those who yell about what constitutes a ""Good American"" the most are those who are willing to violate every Constitutional right to forward their beliefs. Blind, stupid, obedient defenses of McCarthy and those like him isn't American, it's facist.George Clooney makes the very wise decision to use the actual tapes of McCarthy's appearance on Edward R. Murrow's See It Now in 1954 rather than use an actor to play his part. As he did on that program, McCarthy hangs himself with his vile rants against Murrow and his ""jackal pack."" It's chilling to realize how much power McCarthy wielded and how much damage he was able to inflict.In contrast, Clooney presents Edward R. Murrow as a reluctant hero. The great journalist who so vividly broadcast the Nazi bombing of London and who kept America informed during World War II must defend his loyalty to the United States when he dares to challenge the credibility of Senator McCarthy. David Strathairn does a wonderful job of bringing Murrow to life. There isn't a false move, gesture, speech pattern or facial expression by Strathairn in the entire film. Strathairn doesn't try to make Murrow more than what he was. Indeed, Clooney, very wisely and unselfishly, chose to mute his portrayal of Murrow's friend and producer Fred Friendly so that he wouldn't upstage Strathairn's Murrow.What emerges is a down-to-earth, decidedly unflashy, black-and-white portrayal of the events that makes the audience realize both what a danger to democracy McCarthyism was and how much integrity and courage it took for Murrow to challenge it. McCarthy was a crude bully who most likely would have been toppled eventually. But who knows how far his destructive influence might have gone were it not for Murrow? How many more lives would have been ruined and how many more Constitutional rights would have been trampled on? We can only guess, but it's certain that Murrow was instrumental in cutting McCarthy's reign of terror short.However, Clooney's film is more than just a history lesson -- it's a parable to today's America where President Bush's ""you're either with us or against us"" and the right wing's denegration of liberals and opponents of the Iraq War as ""un-Amerian"" brings uncomfortable reminders of the McCarthy era. When an American exercises his or her right to free speech, that person is very often branded as a traitor to their country. A recent letter to the editor in the San Francisco Chronicle even accused anti-war protestors of providing comfort and aid to the enemy. That such attitudes can not only exist today but thrive and flourish and become mainstream within the Republican Party shows that the lessons of the McCarthy era need to be hammered home again and again. Using 9/11 as an excuse to subvert civil rights and civil liberties and crush opposition is more ""un-American"" than all the protest marches put together. George Clooney's Good Night, and Good Luck recognizes that American values of freedom and democracy must always prevail, especially in times of crisis. Otherwise we become no different from the enemies whose values we claim to despise.",5,A Great and Timely Film,1137715200,"01 20, 2006",2006,4111,"['Amazon', 'reviewer', 'recently', 'wrote', 'review', 'claiming', 'everyone', 'investigated', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'was', 'bona', 'fide', 'communist', 'spy', 'brought', 'up', 'Alger', 'Hiss', 'case', 'finding', 'one', 'communist', 'spy', 'justified', 'wholesale', 'trashing', 'civil', 'rights', 'privacy', 'Such', 'ignorance', 'truth', 'just', 'why', 'need', 'film', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'now', 'more', 'ever', 'Joe', 'McCarthy', 'was', 'demagogue', 'who', 'exploited', 'hysteria', 'communism', 'crush', 'civil', 'liberties', 'spread', 'ridiculous', 'lies', 'destroy', 'lives', 'Anyone', 'who', 'even', 'offered', 'support', 'American', 'suspected', 'communist', 'ties', 'often', 'lost', 'jobs', 'were', 'shunned', 'friends', 'family', 'McCarthy', 'played', 'fast', 'loose', 'facts', 'evidenced', 'list', 'alleged', 'communists', 'State', 'Department', 'number', 'names', 'changing', 'speech', 'speech', 'right', 'wing', 'still', 'ridiculous', 'myth', 'McCarthy', 'was', 'kind', 'hero', 'shows', 'what', 'hypocritical', 'lot', 'are', 'interesting', 'who', 'yell', 'what', 'Good', 'American', 'most', 'are', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'violate', 'Constitutional', 'right', 'forward', 'beliefs', 'Blind', 'stupid', 'obedient', 'defenses', 'McCarthy', ""n't"", 'American', 'facist.George', 'Clooney', 'very', 'wise', 'decision', 'use', 'actual', 'tapes', 'McCarthy', 'appearance', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'See', 'Now', '1954', 'rather', 'use', 'actor', 'play', 'part', 'did', 'program', 'McCarthy', 'vile', 'rants', 'Murrow', 'jackal', 'pack', 'chilling', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'power', 'McCarthy', 'wielded', 'how', 'much', 'damage', 'was', 'able', 'inflict.In', 'contrast', 'Clooney', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'great', 'journalist', 'who', 'so', 'vividly', 'Nazi', 'bombing', 'London', 'who', 'kept', 'America', 'informed', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'must', 'defend', 'loyalty', 'United', 'States', 'when', 'challenge', 'credibility', 'Senator', 'McCarthy', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'wonderful', 'job', 'bringing', 'Murrow', 'life', ""n't"", 'false', 'move', 'gesture', 'speech', 'pattern', 'facial', 'expression', 'Strathairn', 'entire', 'film', 'Strathairn', ""n't"", 'try', 'make', 'Murrow', 'more', 'what', 'was', 'Indeed', 'Clooney', 'very', 'wisely', 'unselfishly', 'chose', 'mute', 'portrayal', 'Murrow', 'friend', 'producer', 'Fred', 'Friendly', 'would', ""n't"", 'upstage', 'Strathairn', 'Murrow.What', 'down-to-earth', 'decidedly', 'unflashy', 'black-and-white', 'portrayal', 'events', 'audience', 'realize', 'what', 'danger', 'democracy', 'McCarthyism', 'was', 'how', 'much', 'integrity', 'courage', 'took', 'Murrow', 'challenge', 'McCarthy', 'was', 'crude', 'bully', 'who', 'most', 'likely', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'toppled', 'eventually', 'who', 'how', 'far', 'destructive', 'influence', 'might', 'have', 'gone', 'were', 'not', 'Murrow', 'How', 'many', 'more', 'lives', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'ruined', 'how', 'many', 'more', 'Constitutional', 'rights', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'trampled', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'certain', 'Murrow', 'was', 'instrumental', 'cutting', 'McCarthy', 'reign', 'terror', 'short.However', 'Clooney', 'film', 'more', 'just', 'history', 'lesson', 'parable', 'today', 'America', 'where', 'President', 'Bush', ""'re"", 'right', 'wing', 'denegration', 'liberals', 'opponents', 'Iraq', 'War', 'un-Amerian', 'uncomfortable', 'reminders', 'McCarthy', 'era', 'When', 'American', 'right', 'free', 'speech', 'person', 'very', 'often', 'branded', 'traitor', 'country', 'recent', 'letter', 'editor', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Chronicle', 'even', 'accused', 'anti-war', 'protestors', 'providing', 'comfort', 'aid', 'enemy', 'such', 'attitudes', 'can', 'not', 'only', 'exist', 'today', 'thrive', 'flourish', 'become', 'mainstream', 'Republican', 'Party', 'lessons', 'McCarthy', 'era', 'need', 'be', 'hammered', 'home', 'again', 'again', 'Using', '9/11', 'excuse', 'subvert', 'civil', 'rights', 'civil', 'liberties', 'crush', 'opposition', 'more', 'un-American', 'protest', 'marches', 'put', 'together', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'American', 'values', 'freedom', 'democracy', 'must', 'always', 'prevail', 'especially', 'times', 'crisis', 'become', 'different', 'enemies', 'values', 'claim', 'despise']",N/A

When McCarthy turned on him, Murrow was able to disprove the allegations, and soon the Senate would choose to investigate McCarthy, ending his hunt.""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is a solid movie with a solid cast.  Strathairn is impressive as Murrow, portraying him as a man of integrity and a desire to expose the truth.

641774,A2ZX5079G6KROH,B00005JOKM,"Mike J. Rice ""'Mike Rice, Cultural Historian""","[1, 4]","Ed Murrow Comes From 'Out of the Past'*** This comment may contain spoilers ***At the 1960 conventions on CBS, Murrow, Erik Sevaraid, Charles Collingwood and others would gather in a dark room off the convention floor and analyze events. Wreaths of smoke curled overhead, half blinding the audience. Everyone smoked during those post-convention sessions.Good Night and Good Luck has Ed Murrow smoking during the famous Joe McCarthy documentary on See It Now. The real Ed may have used a cigarette as a prop interviewing Marilyn Monroe but never on See It Now, his serious show.George Clooney co-wrote, directed and appears as Murrow's producer Fred Friendly. I've read twelve books about Murrow, McCarthy and McCarthy Counsel Roy Cohn, but I thought Jeff Daniels was playing CBS President Frank Stanton, not CBS News President Sig Mickelson, until the credits rolled.Straithern must have dieted seriously for Good Night and Good Luck. He is seriously thin in the movie. Murrow's gauntness emphasizes the stress he endures and foreshadows the cancer he will die of eleven years later. David Strathairn has never looked as old and frail in a film as he does here.Strathairn's performance is difficult to accept for those of us who remember Murrow. Strathairn doesn't want to do a straight imitation, he wants to act the part. When he says good night and good luck he turns away as he says good luck. Ed would never have done that. Strathairn is being pinched by the many constraints of the role.In the film Murrow smokes incessantly. Murrow to Fred Friendly: ""Freddie, every time you light my cigarette, I know you're lying to me.""The movie opens with the Murrow staff at CBS in Manhattan preparing to canonize an Air Force Sergeant who has been tossed out of the Service because his father reads subversive magazines.Already CBS Chairman Bill Paley is feeling stomach pains and Friendly and Murrow haven't mentioned the McCarthy show.The audience needs to stretch its legs in this one, but Clooney keeps the action mostly confined to the studio.Robert Downey Junior has little to do here as a member of the Murrow Documentary team. Patricia Clarkson plays his wife and colleague at CBS. Clarkson registers as a bright spot among the shadowy, Noirish filmmakers. She lifts the energy of Murrow's Raiders each time she appears. The film brightens too.Jeff Daniels is cynical as Mickelson the news chief, Paley's henchman overseeing the Murrow crew. But Frank Langella's CBS Chairman Bill Paley is more chilling than the Dracula Langella played twenty years ago.Clooney is average as Murrow Producer Fred Friendly, though he must have put on 60 pounds to play the part.Clarkson, Daniels and Langella have to make way for Ray Wise, who plays WCBS anchorman Don Hollenbeck. Hollenbeck comes under siege from newspaper columnist Jack O'Brien. Wise, who has mostly played showy characters in low budget films, manages a brilliant performance with little screen time.There are fabulous ironies buried in the film. Murrow is smoking himself to death while one of his sponsors shows a spot on his program saying Kent cigarettes have filters on them that make them safe. I saw that commercial when I was an impressionable nine. I finally was able to stop nine years ago.Alcoa sponsors See It Now. Its cornball commercials run unremarked upon by Murrow and his men. Liberace is interviewed on the popular but lightweight Person to Person Ed hosts to balance the books at CBS for losses on See It Now. He asks a youngish Liberace when he is likely to get married, another irony since everyone knows now the flamboyant piano player was gay.The film uses the real McCarthy from film clips, and the real Liberace. Only once did I hear the real Ed's voice on the track. Assistant Defense Counsel Bobby Kennedy could be seen in clips along with Arkansas Senator John McClellan and Missouri Senator Stuart Symington. Archive film integrates smoothly with acted material.Murrow colleague Eric Sevaraid said that Ed was late going after McCarthy. Clooney uses a less dramatic part of Army Counsel Joseph Welch's attack on McCarthy to make it appear it was Murrow who slew Joe and not Welch at the McCarthy Hearings.But it was neither Murrow nor Welch who finished Joe. McCarthy Committee Chief Counsel Roy Cohn and Private David Schine earlier toured Embassies and US Information Agency stations in Europe with the press in tow. The two censored and replaced books like a couple of disciples of Joseph Goebbels. The Press had a field day mocking them. McCarthy backed up Schine and Cohn with an investigation of the Army after it balked at letting Schine be relieved from duty to serve on Joe's staff. It would have been the moral equivalent of the Army assigning PFC Elvis Presley to serve as assistant to Sun Records Producer Sam Phillips.One day during the three months of the McCarthy hearing Welch needled Cohn and McCarthy with an absurd conversation about 'pixies,' a sly attempt at unmasking Cohn's homosexuality to hip viewers, while subtly informing McCarthy that Welch had sharks teeth too.Welch's dramatic condemnation of Joe for revealing Welch colleague Fred Fisher as a member of a Communist Party Front was left on Clooney's cutting room floor. That missing footage was powerful enough to get Welch a role as Judge in the film Anatomy of a Murder.McCarthy was censured by the Senate and died three years later of acute cirrhosis. A decade later Poet Alan Ginsberg came to Appleton, Wisconsin for a poetry reading and afterward danced on Joe's grave.Good Night and Good Luck is a movie for cynics. A film for people who lived during the era and cracked wise. Even the New York Times couldn't resist a wise guy tout for the film: ""SEE IT NOW!""",3,Ed Murrow Comes 'Out of the Past',1134345600,"12 12, 2005",2005,5735,"['Ed', 'Murrow', 'Comes', 'From',

641775,A1FG91CM8221X1,B00005JOKM,Miles D. Moore,"[10, 16]","George Clooney's ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is a tight, enthralling, intensely concentrated film that takes us back to the Scoundrel Time of Sen. Joseph McCarthy's Communist witch hunt, and relates how a courageous band of reporters at CBS News, led by Edward R. Murrow, helped alert America to McCarthy's demagoguery. Of course it's now well-known that there were indeed Communists in high places in the federal government in the early 1950s; it cannot be stressed too strongly, however, that the presence of Stalinists in the government didn't justify McCarthy acting like Stalin. (His blunderbuss techniques ruined many innocent lives while missing some genuinely dangerous individuals; it wasn't McCarthy, for example, who caught Alger Hiss.) McCarthy tap-danced in football cleats on the rights of due process, and Murrow's 1954 ""See It Now"" reports on McCarthy were magnificent and courageous acts of public service. Viewers may differ on how closely the events of 1954 parallel our own day; but the film's quiet insistence on the value of serious journalism, and its condemnation of trivial, celebrity-obsessed TV news, is right on the money, particularly in the age of Bill O'Reilly and Paris Hilton. A 1958 speech by Murrow, warning of precisely such trivialization, bookends the movie, and it could not be more pertinent. (Murrow knew the drill all too well; the studio brass continually trimmed back ""See It Now"" while forcing him to do more and more ""Person to Person"" celebrity interviews, which were mostly canned and which he found onerous.) Clooney, the son of a newsman, obviously knows the world of TV journalism well, and he and producer Grant Heslov have fashioned a cogent, breathlessly entertaining screenplay. The story pretty much stays zeroed in on the McCarthy reports, except for a subplot about Joe and Shirley Wershba, whose secret marriage went against the strict policy of CBS News. (The Wershba plot feels somewhat extraneous, though as performed by the master actors Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson, it goes down easy.) As director, Clooney makes some gutsy moves that pay off big. For one thing, he and cinematographer Robert Elswit film in black and white, giving ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" an impeccable 1950s feel; for another, he didn't hire an actor to play McCarthy, but depicts the senator only by dint of archival film, once again allowing that scoundrel to hang himself all over again. But the main glory of ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is in the casting; besides Downey and Clarkson, there is an impeccable ensemble cast including Clooney himself (as CBS News President Fred Friendly), Frank Langella (as network head William Paley), Jeff Daniels, Ray Wise and Reed Diamond. The biggest acting kudos, however, go to David Strathairn as Murrow. In a 30-year film acting career, Strathairn has always been quietly, unobtrusively excellent, as a member of the John Sayles Stock Company (""Return of the Secaucus Seven,"" ""Matewan,"" ""Passion Fish"") and in such projects as ""The River Wild"" and ""The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd."" ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is virtually his first opportunity to be the star, and he dominates the movie in a performance that captures Murrow's charisma, wry wit and leonine moral seriousness. It is a joy to see such a great but underrated actor be given such a golden chance at the limelight, and Strathairn has to be considered among the front runners for this year's Best Actor Oscar.",5,See it now.

641776,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00005JOKM,mirasreviews,"[4, 7]","In ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" , the Fourth Estate gets a good cinematic scolding in the form of a stylish black-and-white dramatization of the 1953-1954 battle between journalist Edward R. Murrow and Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy, waged over the airwaves on Murrow's television news magazine ""See It Now"". The stated intention of director and co-writer George Clooney is to give the news media a lesson in civic responsibility, picking up Edward R. Murrow's banner in chiding television networks for providing nothing but ""decadence, escapism, and insulation from the realities of the world in which we live"". Now that we have a startling array of choices in news and entertainment on broadcast and pay television, it seems clear that the market for penetrating commentary and dissent is small. But viewers may the appreciate the similarities between the actions of House Un-American Activities Committee and more recent trampling of civil liberties in efforts to combat terrorism.In October 1953 at CBS Studios, popular television journalist Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) and producer Fred Friendly (George Clooney) decide to take on the communist witchhunt that is sweeping the nation in the early years of the cold war. ""See It Now"" runs a story about Air Force Lieutenant Milo Radulovich, who has been dismissed from the armed forces on account of his father's and sister's alleged left-wing politics. Radulovich never knew the charges against him, as they were sealed from even his lawyer. That was the beginning of a battle of words between Senator Joseph McCarthy and Edward R. Murrow that culminated in April 1954 when McCarthy took to the airwaves himself with an impassioned, rambling response to Murrow's accusations that HUAC displayed a ""hysterical disregard for decency...and the rights preserved by the Constitution"" in condemning Americans as communist subversives based on hearsay. Milo Radulovich was reinstated, demonstrating the power of television and encouraging the coterie of liberal journalists on staff at ""See It Now"", as CBS mogul William Paley (Frank Langhella) tried to balance ideals with the realities of commercial television.""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is a polemic in conversations and vignettes more than a traditional narrative. It's an interesting look behind the scenes of television news in the 1950s, where we see everything from Murrow interviewing Liberace for his celebrity show ""Person to Person"", to Joe and Shirley Wershba (Robert Downey, Jr. & Patricia Clarkson) hiding their marriage, to journalists forced to sign statements denying any communist connections. It's part documentary: Joseph McCarthy is represented by himself using old HUAC and ""See It Now"" footage. Dianne Reeves sung the jazz soundtrack live. Good writing by George Clooney and Grant Heslov and fantastic editing by Stephen Mirrione keep it all from seeming disjointed. Unaffected performances by a magnificent cast keep the audience connected to the people, not just the politics. I'm very fond of black-and-white film, and ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" does not disappoint. It's relatively low budget and shows no shortage of low-key b&w; cliches. But the rich, sensual shadows and occasional new lighting trick won me over. It's beautiful. Between this and ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"", George Clooney impresses me as a director capable of using non-traditional narrative and visual styles with great success. Edward R. Murrow was a confirmed self-righteous crusader for many a cause. ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" doesn't deny that. It does explore the power of the media and the excesses of ""national security"".The DVD (Warner Brothers 2006): Bonus features include one featurette, an audio commentary, and a theatrical trailer (2 min). ""Good Night and Good Luck Companion Piece"" features interviews with the cast and writers, as well as with people who knew and worked with Edward R. Murrrow, including Murrow's son and Milo Radulovich. They discuss the political atmosphere of the time, television news then and now, and the goals of the film. The audio commentary by George Clooney and Grant Heslov is frustratingly casual at times. It's spotty and includes some technical details, some additional history, and some discussion of themes.

The movie faithfully depicts, through faithful reproduction of his monologues as well as actual footage, the sequence of programmes Ed Murrow made exposing McCarthy and ulimtately playing a part in bringing about his downfall.  This is  mixed with the drama of what was going on behind the scenes and the real cost of telling it like it was at a time when fear was king, and telling the truth had real consequences.This is a talking heads movie - there is no flash bang effects, or tense scenes.  It's all about what was being said, and why it was being said.  Even then, you have to listen pretty hard because Clooney has used a verite style of people talking as they do in real life, overlapping and not always talking in neat sentences.. except for those masterful monologues.  The movie is in black and white, which does not detract but rather accentuates the drama both by making it feel authentically of its time, and bringing out rich detail of the characters expressions and nuances.. and as a sidenote, cigarette smoke has never looked more beautiful, almost a character in itself at times - how jarring it is to see one of the most respected newscasters, with cigarette in hand while addressing the nation!The acting is simply perfect - Strathairn is knockout as Murrow, and must have spent ages poring over his newsacst to so faithfully recreate him, and do so with so much heart.For me the movie had two messages - one, the obvious political one, and the other - the state of television today.  There is nothing on TV now that comes close to the intelligence and impact of Murrow's pieces.Watch this if you want something to spark debate and conversation - don't watch this for a popcorn movie or if you want something exciting or tense.

641780,A1S5B32WYMEE44,B00005JOKM,"M. Swinney ""Marc My Words""","[7, 9]","Edward R. Murrow, it seems, was a very brave soul in a time that needed brave souls.  Also, Murrow added his journalistic integrity and simple courage to a cause in a time where it seemed difficult, if not suicidal, to be brave and take a stand against elements of the United States Government.  For the artistic telling of a period in Murrow's life, an artistic rendering of a conflict of ideas, a paralleled parable to our current 'culture of fear' times, Clooney and Grant Heslov deserved the 78th Academy Awards Best Motion Picture of the Year Award for films made in 2005.  And that is my stated opinion considering 2005 was a strong year for finely made films with one of the stronger batch of contenders, historically.There is so much to talk about that works strongly in Clooney and Heslov's, ""Good Night and Good Luck,"" that for one, I'm not sure where to begin, and two, I struggle to reach conciseness.  The musical score is brilliantly done to flavor the film with rich jazz belaying a time in the mid to late 1950's in which the film covers.  Hats off to Dianne Reeves, who you may learn from the audio commentary, plays most of the music live on set.  Let's talk a little about lead actor, David Strathairn's performance.  Clooney has said that Strathairn is an actor's actor but before I viewed, ""Good Night and Good Luck,"" I'd have to say that portrayal may be accurate.  I say this because it seems to the viewing public, Strathairn's body of work just isn't that well known.  However, after ""Good Night and Good Luck,"" I think Strathairn will be drawing in a more popularized audience of folks who follow his work.  It seems he was born to play this part of Murrow, he does it that well.  I, for one, will be looking at DVD rentals with Strathairn in them in a different intrigued ""rent me"" sort of light.OK, now to get at the meat and potatoes of the movie and why I think it deserves to be on a top 20 films in the last say...three decades sort of list.  First and foremost, ""Good Night and Good Luck,"" seems to draw from history a period of intense national public debate and thread it through to relevance on what the Viet Nam war meant and what the current Global War on Terrorism means.  I'm not sure if this was Clooney or Heslov's intention but it's the effect it had on me and I'm sure isn't lost on others.  **Side note here...I keep saying Clooney and Heslov in one breath because you will learn from the audio commentary that this dynamic duo have been working together in Hollywood for quite some time and each share the responsibilities in this film for writing the screenplay, believing in the film, and ultimately (though it's not billed this way) sharing co-director roles.**So Edward R. Murrow's personal bravery and courage was just a very visible part of the bravery and courage exhibited by the people of tje Columbia Broadcast System (CBS) company from it's news team all the way up to President, William S. Paley.  When Senator Joseph McCarthy (incredulously played in this film by himself) fueled the pink scare through the House Committee Hearing on Un-American Activities, he not only unduly sent the majority of the American Public into a culture of fear, but effectively ruined a good number of personal lives and professional careers.  CBS had a great role in putting a stop to that.  This, I believe, is faithfully told in Clooney and Heslov's film without too much subversion of the historical truth to garner a ticket-selling dramatic flair.The real reason the film is so important is that the modern media, in a time where bravery for standing up for principles and journalistic integrity may be a difficult prospect; is so needed in our current climate of national and international fear during this Global War on Terrorism.  Bravery is needed today now more than ever.  The principles that Murrow and the CBS team stood ground on during the communist witch trials of the 50's, and again stood ground on during the Viet Nam conflict, seems sadly and sorely missed today.  Where are those Murrow's, Friendly's, and Paley's of yesteryear? Who is going to fill those shoes today?  We need you again, CBS, CNN or whomever is willing to step up to the plate to ensure the truth be told, and that the truth drives national debate, which in turn fuels national and international policy.  Only if this bravery is present today, will it allow national and international leadership to avoid decision point mistakes like those made in waging war against Iraq.Clooney, Heslov, thank you for giving us the best film of 2005 even though the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences didn't see it that way.

The main storyline in GNAGL is just like that turkey: a little too dry, uncomplicated, safe. A good chunk of the film incorporates actual McCarthy footage, which is great, but at the same time contributes to the film feeling very much like a documentary. It also stifles the film from building in intensity. Perhaps, that was Clooney's intention. Other reviewers have gushed over Clooney and Heslov's writing, but when stripped of the aforementioned footage, there's just not enough there to merit the gradiose accolades they have garnered.The stuffing of this film, however, is first-rate: the smokey black and white cinematography captures the essence of an enviable era where men looked sharp and women were elegant; the interspersed jazz numbers of songstress Dianne Reeves are sensational; the Kent cigarette ad and Liberace interview are funny, indeed.David Strathairn (excellent as the alcoholic husband in Dolores Claiborne) turns in a great performance as Edward R. Murrow, and a best actor nomination seems likely. Frank Langella is likewise very good. Jeff Daniels, although a small part, manages quite well with his role and demonstrates his versatility as a first-rate actor.Overall, recommended.",3,"Not that this film is a turkey, but . . .",1131753600,"11 12, 2005",2005,1375,"['Not', 'film', 'turkey', 'remind', 'Thanksgiving', 'dinners', 'where', 'stuffing', 'excellent', 'turkey', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'dry', 'main', 'storyline', 'GNAGL', 'just', 'turkey', 'little', 'too', 'dry', 'uncomplicated', 'safe', 'good', 'chunk', 'film', 'actual', 'McCarthy', 'footage', 'great', 'same', 'time', 'contributes', 'film', 'feeling', 'very', 'much', 'documentary', 'also', 'film', 'building', 'intensity', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'Clooney', 'intention', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'gushed', 'Clooney', 'Heslov', 'writing', 'when', 'stripped', 'aforementioned', 'footage', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'there', 'merit', 'gradiose', 'have', 'garnered.The', 'stuffing', 'film', 'however', 'first-rate', 'smokey', 'black', 'white', 'cinematography', 'essence', 'enviable', 'era', 'where', 'men', 'looked', 'sharp', 'women', 'were', 'elegant', 'interspersed', 'jazz', 'numbers', 'songstress', 'Dianne', 'Reeves', 'are', 'sensational', 'Kent', 'cigarette', 'ad', 'Liberace', 'interview', 'are', 'funny', 'indeed.David', 'Strathairn', 'excellent', 'alcoholic', 'husband', 'Dolores', 'Claiborne', 'great', 'performance', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'best', 'actor', 'nomination', 'likely', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'likewise', 'very', 'good', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'small', 'part', 'quite', 'well', 'role', 'versatility', 'first-rate', 'actor.Overall', 'recommended']",N/A

Was this really Meryl Streep's estranged husband in ""The River Wild'?  Director George Clooney shows great promise behind and in front of the camera.  Clooney portrays producer Fred Friendly to Straitharn's Edmund Murrow.  Others you have seen before play other actual charecters from the 'McCarthy' era, including Robert Downey and Frank Langella.  It is a very good cast in what is mostly ensemble acting.  Don't expect deep portrayls of each charecter, it doesn't exist here.Essentially, this movie is about the confrontation of Murrow and Friendly and McCarthy, and how Murrow felt that McCarthy's tactics need to be exposed.  However, you don't really need to know anything about McCarthy or Murrow to understand and enjoy this movie.  Great acting and a great story provide intellectual excitement.  The fircrackers are really about the debate itself rather than what you see onscreen.  There isn't screaming and yelling to abound - but rather confrontations about ideas.Clooney filmed this movie in black and white - which is a nice move because it allows the use of actual footage from hearings, it gives a crisp noirish feel to the movie, and somehow it evokes the era, and gives added depth to the actors faces.Essentially, the story is a study in the human drama unfolding between a crusading journalist, the owner of CBS - William Paley, and the interests each thinks it serves.  The speech which bookends the movie seems timely, because in many ways the premise of the film is that television - according to Murrow - should serve a higher purpose, and yet the realities of business always nip at the public interest's heels.I find that the movie doesn't really speak to the current time as much as many wish it did - the reality is that the movie could have aired in any number of decades of American history and still be relevant.  The fact is that the movie is about the reality of journalism and economics.  Such is the tension of a free press.Thus, anyone expecting to see a damnation of the current administration in thinly veiled history is deluding themselves - it really doesn't apply here as it could to any other administration.  The tension between being able to speak truth to power is always with us, fortunately, and of course filled with great tension.A 'small' movie about an important premise, part civics lesson, and definitely entertaining, it is a movie worth seeing.  Leave political beliefs at the theatre door and become immersed in a battle that should always be waged in a vigorous democracy.",4,Interesting and worthwhile movie.,1144022400,"04 3, 2006",2006,2871,"['Here', 'skinny', 'movie', 'black', 'white', 'movie', 'interesection', 'politics', 'journalism', 'freedom', 'press', 'serve', 'twin', 'masters', ""'the"", 'public', 'interest', 'business', 'needs.Edmund', 'Murrow', 'portrayed', 'David', 'Straitharn', 'so', 'immersed', 'charecter', 'forgot', 'guy', 'so', 'many', ""'those"", 'movies', 'Was', 'really', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'estranged', 'husband', 'River', 'Wild', 'Director', 'George', 'Clooney', 'great', 'promise', 'behind', 'front', 'camera', 'Clooney', 'producer', 'Fred', 'Friendly', 'Straitharn', 'Edmund', 'Murrow', 'Others', 'have', 'seen', 'play', 'other', 'actual', 'charecters', ""'McCarthy"", 'era', 'including', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'very', 'good', 'cast', 'what', 'mostly', 'ensemble', 'acting', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'deep', 'portrayls', 'charecter', ""n't"", 'exist', 'here.Essentially', 'movie', 'confrontation', 'Murrow', 'Friendly', 'McCarthy', 'how', 'Murrow', 'felt', 'McCarthy', 'tactics', 'need', 'be', 'exposed', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'know', 'anything', 'McCarthy', 'Murrow', 'understand', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'Great', 'acting', 'great', 'story', 'provide', 'intellectual', 'excitement', 'fircrackers', 'are', 'really', 'debate', 'rather', 'what', 'see', 'onscreen', ""n't"", 'screaming', 'yelling', 'abound', 'rather', 'confrontations', 'ideas.Clooney', 'filmed', 'movie', 'black', 'white', 'nice', 'move', 'use', 'actual', 'footage', 'hearings', 'crisp', 'noirish', 'feel', 'movie', 'somehow', 'era', 'added', 'depth', 'actors', 'faces.Essentially', 'story', 'study', 'human', 'drama', 'unfolding', 'crusading', 'journalist', 'owner', 'CBS', 'William', 'Paley', 'interests', 'speech', 'movie', 'timely', 'many', 'ways', 'premise', 'film', 'television', 'according', 'Murrow', 'should', 'serve', 'higher', 'purpose', 'yet', 'realities', 'business', 'always', 'nip', 'public', 'interest', 'heels.I', 'find', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'speak', 'current', 'time', 'as', 'much', 'many', 'wish', 'did', 'reality', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'aired', 'number', 'decades', 'American', 'history', 'still', 'be', 'relevant', 'fact', 'movie', 'reality', 'journalism', 'economics', 'Such', 'tension', 'free', 'press.Thus', 'anyone', 'expecting', 'see', 'damnation', 'current', 'administration', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'history', 'deluding', 'really', ""n't"", 'apply', 'here', 'could', 'other', 'administration', 'tension', 'being', 'able', 'speak', 'truth', 'power', 'always', 'fortunately', 'course', 'filled', 'great', 'tension.A', 'movie', 'important', 'premise', 'part', 'civics', 'lesson', 'definitely', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'seeing', 'Leave', 'political', 'beliefs', 'theatre', 'door', 'become', 'immersed', 'battle', 'should', 'always', 'be', 'waged', 'vigorous', 'democracy']",N/A
641784,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B00005JOKM,Newton Ooi,"[0, 0]","Good Night, and Good Luck was the famous television sign-off by one of American television's most famous journalists; Edward R. Morrow of CBS.  Jumping into the national spotlight with his work during WWII, Morrow became a mainstay of American TV during the 1950s.  This show expands on one of the most important chapters of his career, his initial and public questioning of Senator McCarthy's tactics on his news show.  This questioning would be the beginning of the end for McCarthy, as it led others to oppose the red-baiting senator, and eventually to his censure by the US Senate.The entire movie is shown in black and white to parallel television of that time.  The primary setting is the studios and offices of CBS, and occasionally the homes and restaurants frequented by the employees of CBS at that time.  George Clooney is not the star of this movie, but certainly deserved the Supporting Actor Academy Award nomination.  No, the star is David Straithairn, who plays Edward R. Morrow.  The face and voice are spot on.  Outside of the central confrontation between McCarthy and Morrow, the movie subtly highlights many other features of life in the 1950s.  One for example is the marriage between two of the CBS employees.  Many US corporations at that time banned employees from marrying each other, but if you were high enough in the chain of command, you could probably get by with a wink of the eye and purposeful ignorance of your co-workers.  Another example is the prevalence of smoking in the workplace, something that essentially disappeared in corporate America by the 1980s.The movie and its central conflict are bookended by a speech Morrow gives at an awards function in which he attacks the transformation of television from a medium of inspiration and education to a medium of entertainment.  All in all, a great movie.  It comes in at 1.5 hours, and so flows quite quickly.

Kennedy's 15th reunion of his class at Harvard College, got up to toast Harvard for never having produced an Alger Hiss or a Joe McCarthy, John F. Kennedy stood up and walked out, roaring, ""How dare you couple the name of a great American patriot with that of a traitor.""  What would today's domestic communists, oppps.. 'radical leftists', have to say about JFK's comment?The Hollywood limousine liberal promoters of this movie are the same appeasing 'America-is-always-wrong' crowd presently demanding Washington surrender to Tehran's Islamic guarantors of jihadic related terrorism, as well as their world-wide communist loyalists.

Ther had been political precedents for the action: England starving the Gaelic Irish in the middle of the 19th Century, Nazi Germany ethnically cleansing its Aryan race in the 30's and 40's, still there was room to refine the tactic. Enter a neo-con from the great state of Minnesota, dabble in draconian fear mongering with the homo-erotic fanatacism of an FBI director whose tastes were kept secret and would today be the envy of Michael Jackson, target a group who simplistically embraced a totalitarian principle out of intellectual naivete (almost as pernicious a disease as fanatical obedience), and you begin to ride the slippery slope toward an Orwellian nightmare. Lives were ruined, careers dashed, suicides ensued in order to keep the red threat at bay. Of course, today, the Red Threat has more to do with a neo-christian fascism with a particular red state and texas twang.It's no accident that George Clooney had the courage to make and then release this film. It should have been awarded Best Picture, but, you see, Hollywood still hasn't recovered from the first purge, and what there is there in the likes of Spielberg, Lucas and so many others is a buy into the whole capitalist machine. They dislike what the neo-cons stand for, but not that much. At least not until they are ordered back into the boxcars.This is the engaging story of a man who essentially was an ardent patriot and had little intellectual sympathy for the naivete mentioned above. At the same time, he had not lost his moral compass and knew right from wrong, good from evil. Steeling his nerve he dared take on the black knight of American paranoia and his own boss, another one whose ethnic background should have taught him the dangers inherent in molly-coddling with a capitalist hegemony that would grind him and his tribe under the wheel, and were in fact in the process of doing so, but Paley is another story.David Straitharn and George Clloney and the entire cast give performances for the ages. Every word rings true. The portrait of Murrow here is a portrait in courage that few have ever embraced. Like those kids in front of the Chinese tanks in Tianemin Square, Murrow stood up to a fascist machine and refused to capitulate for the sake of his own safety.Are there any such men today? Joe Wilson, perhaps. Not many more. Cindy Sheehan, the Zappala family, a handful of others. Why?In the 19th Century, German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Hegel lamented that his fellow German countrymen were all to willing to surrender their freedoms in return for a pittance in tax relief.Has anything changed?

Only the Democrats will participate because the Republican party is so corrupt. You have Quakers who have been infiltrated by government spies and put on the terror watch list. The only difference between the 1950's and today is there are no journalists who have the guts to stand up for what is right and report on this. I see major news taking place on C-SPAN that the networks completely ignore. The United States is ranked at the bottom of the list when it comes to a free press in the world. What we are fed is corporate propaganda just like Edward R. Murrow feared. The sad part about this movie is that Murrow was 100% correct in the direction he saw the news media heading in. If you want real news about this country you have to travel outside of it and that's pathetic seeing how we claim to be the best country in the world because we have so many freedoms.

Murrow was not a particularly handsome man nor did he possess the charisma that seems to be a prerequisite to be a television anchor in our day.  Rather,  Murrow was  a dedicated journalist who cared deeply about his country and who would ultimately risk his career in the pursuit of a story.  ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is George Clooney's outstanding 2005 film recalling Murrow's relentless investigation into the motivation behind and the conduct of the House Un-American Activities Committee (or HUAC) hearings of the early 1950s led by Wisconsin's Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy.  It was McCarthy and the Committee's chief counsel Roy Cohn who sought to prove their claim that hundreds of avowed Communists were working covertly as Soviet spies in the U.S. government.  Filmed in black and white and sprinkled with actual footage of these historic hearings ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" recalls those days marked by fear and paramoia and proves once again that sometimes the best strategy is to let people keep talking and allow them to discredit themselves.  It is a compelling story!""Good Night, and Good Luck"" features a fine ensemble cast led by David Strathaim who shines in the role of Ed Murrow and Clooney himself who plays Murrow's producer Fred Friendly.  Other notable performances include Robert Downey Jr. in the role of CBS News correspondent Joseph Wershba and Frank Langella who portrays the conflicted chief executive of CBS William Paley.  Clearly, Ed Murrow and CBS News stuck their neck out in an effort to expose the draconian tactics being employed by Senator McCarthy and his followers.  One wishes that news organizations these days had the guts to do the same.  Clooney chose to punctuate his film with a number of clips featuring jazz singer Dianne Reeves.  I thought this tactic was extremely effective in giving the audience a sense of just what was going on in America back in the early 1950's.""Good Night, and Good Luck"" reminds us what the goals of an individual reporter and a news organization really should be. Broadcast journalists should report the news not comment on it.  Meanwhile, if a network feels compelled to editorialize that is fine but the commentary should be clearly labelled as such.  It is sad to see what network and cable news programs have become.  Seeing ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" reminded me of the outstanding network news organizations at both CBS and NBC when I was growing up.  I hope that I live to see the day when that kind of quality reporting is once again the rule rather than the exception.

You think it is Murrow even if you are very familiar with Murrow's face, voice, and mannerisms.  The film shows the conflicts and risks early TV journalists experienced to confront an evil at which many others cowered.

Henry,"[5, 7]","Good Night and Good Luck: Reviewed by Philip HenryI am fortunate to be old enough to remember watching the Army-McCarthy Hearings on television. I recall Boston Attorney Joseph Welch,  after having his client subjected to McCarthy's sleazy innuendo, demanding: ""Sir, Have you no Decency?""We are all fortunate that CBS, then America's preeminent network, had journalists of the caliber of Edward R. Murrow and Fred Friendly to call McCarthy on the tactics in a courageous series of broadcasts.It wasn't too long after the Hollywood 10 Witchhunt that ended or clouded the career of a dozen writers and directors. It took creative energy from Arthur Miller (The Crucible) and others to point to the parallels between the Salem Witch Trials and the McCarthy Era.  It's difficult today to remember the fear and paranoia that McCarthy engendered, but watching George Clooney's ""Good Night and Good Luck"" brings it all back. The Question ""Are you now, or have you ever been, a Member of the Communist Party"" was everywhere.When a young Lieutenant was drummed out of the Air Force as a Security Risk because his father was a European Immigrant with tenuous connections to socialism, Murrow and Friendly acted.  Working with strict professionalism and understatement,they excoriated McCarthy and portrayed him as the  sputtering, devious political hack that he was.The casting is superb, with David Strathairn  as Murrow, Clooney as Friendly, Robert Downey Jr. and Frank Langella as CBS Chairman William Paley.The editing is remarkable, intercutting 1950's footage of McCarthy as himself with contemporary interviews.  The mood and feel of the film is great: black and white cinematography; starched white shirts, gray flannel suits and the ever-present cigarette for the men; and wonderful music.In the defining moment of the film(the live broadcast in which Murrow directly takes on McCarthy)the tension is palpable.  The Control Room was a scene of controlled chaos with producers, directors and technicians scrambling to get the show on the air. Paley comes into the control room in a show of support, despite the danger to his Network.As Murrow says during the show's preparation,""The Fear is in this room.""*****  An intense and remarkably well done testament to the courage of three men.Too bad that it couldn't be done today: too many squeamish Corporate ""suits"" with no understanding of Journalism control the Media.",5,"""Sir, Have You No Decency?""",1170028800,"01 29, 2007",2007,2415,"['Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'Reviewed', 'Philip', 'HenryI', 'am', 'fortunate', 'be', 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'watching', 'Army-McCarthy', 'Hearings', 'television', 'recall', 'Boston', 'Attorney', 'Joseph', 'Welch', 'having', 'client', 'subjected', 'McCarthy', 'sleazy', 'innuendo', 'demanding', 'Sir', 'Have', 'Decency', 'are', 'fortunate', 'CBS', 'then', 'America', 'preeminent', 'network', 'had', 'journalists', 'caliber', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'Fred', 'Friendly', 'call', 'McCarthy', 'tactics', 'courageous', 'series', 'broadcasts.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'long', 'Hollywood', '10', 'Witchhunt', 'ended', 'clouded', 'career', 'dozen', 'writers', 'directors', 'took', 'creative', 'energy', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'Crucible', 'others', 'point', 'parallels', 'Salem', 'Witch', 'Trials', 'McCarthy', 'Era', 'difficult', 'today', 'remember', 'fear', 'paranoia', 'McCarthy', 'engendered', 'watching', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'back', 'Question', 'now', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'Member', 'Communist', 'Party', 'was', 'everywhere.When', 'young', 'Lieutenant', 'was', 'drummed', 'Air', 'Force', 'Security', 'Risk', 'father', 'was', 'European', 'Immigrant', 'tenuous', 'connections', 'socialism', 'Murrow', 'Friendly', 'acted', 'Working', 'strict', 'professionalism', 'understatement', 'excoriated', 'McCarthy', 'portrayed', 'sputtering', 'devious', 'political', 'hack', 'was.The', 'casting', 'superb', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'Murrow', 'Clooney', 'Friendly', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'CBS', 'Chairman', 'William', 'Paley.The', 'editing', 'remarkable', 'intercutting', '1950', 'footage', 'McCarthy', 'contemporary', 'interviews', 'mood', 'feel', 'film', 'great', 'black', 'white', 'cinematography', 'starched', 'white', 'shirts', 'gray', 'flannel', 'suits', 'ever-present', 'cigarette', 'men', 'wonderful', 'music.In', 'defining', 'moment', 'film', 'live', 'broadcast', 'Murrow', 'directly', 'McCarthy', 'tension', 'palpable', 'Control', 'Room', 'was', 'scene', 'controlled', 'chaos', 'producers', 'directors', 'technicians', 'scrambling', 'get', 'show', 'air', 'Paley', 'control', 'room', 'show', 'support', 'danger', 'Network.As', 'Murrow', 'show', 'preparation', 'Fear', 'room', 'intense', 'remarkably', 'well', 'done', 'testament', 'courage', 'three', 'men.Too', 'bad', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'done', 'today', 'too', 'many', 'squeamish', 'Corporate', 'suits', 'understanding', 'Journalism', 'control', 'Media']",N/A

641803,A292YWWNFVSIWY,B00005JOKM,Publius,"[4, 6]","The sad part about this movie is that it is a self-fulfilling prophecy in and of itself.  The movie is bookended by a speech by Murrow about the potential that television can have for the enlightenment of humanity.  In the speech, Murrow correctly predicted that television would instead appeal to the lowest common denominator.  Thus, instead of education, we got stupidity.  Instead of ""See It Now"" we got ""Temptation Island.""  Thus, a movie about serious issues has the unfortunate fate of having a short run in the major metropolitan areas, and having an even shorter one in the secondary markets.  The real crux of the movie is about the Red Scare of the 1950's and how Murrow and McCarthy faced off.  Murrow of course won and McCarthy was defeated.  The screenwriter would have us believe that Murrow and CBS single-handedly brought down McCarthyism.  The truth of the matter is that McCarthy had not only reached the point of self-destruction, he had also reached the tipping point of angering friends and associates in higher places.  I give credit to Clooney for giving us the extended footage of Welch's rebuke of McCarthy ending in ""Have you no sense of decency sir, at long last?""  Although directed by well entrenched Hollywood figure George Clooney, the movie has been basically ignored by mainstream media, and as said before, has had a very short run in the secondary markets.In a time when opposition to war is spun as unpatriotic, it is refreshing to hear that we should not confuse dissent with disloyalty.  When we live in a culture of media scare tactics, we should hear: ""we will not walk in fear of one another.""  ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" besides being beautifully filmed, should be shown to the younger generation who have no idea who Joe McCarthy is, besides a fleeting reference to McCarthyism in their High School reading of ""The Crucible.""  Although the movie focuses on the downfall of McCarthy, the real horror story is how fast the contagion of McCarthyism spread through the country.  In the end, this film is really about bravery and practicing what you preach.  But, did Murrow win?  Yes, he and others besides him beat back McCarthy, but the war for television, I believe, was lost the moment television executives realized that TV is so good at its worst, why even try for its best.

Senator Joseph McCarthy demonstrated one of the greatest abuses of political power based upon the social fear of communism following WWII.  For over four years beginning in early 1950 he trampled upon the US Constitution with his allegations of communist infiltrations in the government and society.  In 1953, in conjunction with McCarthy's ill-fated investigation of an alledged spy ring in the the US Army, Edward R. Murrow's program about the unsubstantiated dismissal of a loyal USAF officer played a pivotal role turning the tide of public opinion against a seemingly invincible government official. Murrow's program helped focus the brightest of lights on McCarthy under which his paranoia-fed falsehoods eventualy wilted.  ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" details the backstory of Murrow's effort.The movie was filmed in color and digitized later to B&W.;  B&W; movies have a way of intensifying the drama of a scene when the lighting and shadows are perfect.  Although there are many brilliant B&W; scenes in the film there are also several scenes that appear flat, muting the drama.  That is my only criticism of the film.  Overall though the B&W; is effectual, adding a period anchor to the early 50's when all TV was B&W.;Every actor in the cast rose to a level of their art that is impressive so it would be foolish to list them all here.  I will say David Strathairn's performance of Murrow truly deserved the Best Actor Oscar nomination he received.Finally, the quality of the DVD transfer.  I picked up a used copy of the movie here on Amazon for 1 cent plus shipping, a price that's tough to beat.

It about a period of American history that is so embarrassing and, yet, so fascinating. A documentary from the 60's, ""Point of Order"", was all about the Army vs McCarthy hearings. This film is compelling from beginning to end. George Clooney definitely had an idea, and ran with it. His best choice was David Strathairn as Edward R. Murrow. He was certainly an excellent choice, and is excellent with everything the script asked him to do. Unfortunatey, aside from his blatant integrity, we end up knowing nothing about Murrow, as the man. Apparently, he's a family man, but no mention of the family seems to be important. Then, there's a big deal made about Robert Downey, Jr., and Patricia Clarkson being married. I wasn't sure why that was important, other than to suggest that married peope couldn't work at the station; also, they were the best at their jobs. Another thing that bothered me was that Mr.Clooney seemed to expect the general audience to already have some background before they come in. I had this background, but wonder if those going without this knowledge would understand how brutal and devastating this actually was. McCarthy was an egomaniac, and it's impossible to understand where he was coming from. Clooney handled this the only way possible, by using actual footage. Roy Cohn, ""Angels in America"" aside, was also shown for his true colors. David Strathairn gives a totally complete performance, given his script limitations. He gives Murrow the dignity and strength of purpose that were so much his trademark. If supporting kudos should go out, they should go to Frank Langella as Paley, the real reason Murrow was allowed to continue his assault on McCarthy. As I said, once McCarthy was unglued, Murrow's family faced lots of potential turmoil as a result. Regardless, Clooney opened the gates to see a slice of American life, shameful as it was, in the glorious black & white glory that we all experienced back when. This is a fine achievement, and worthy of your consideration.  UPDATE: I tried to discuss this film with my young co-workers, and they didn't know anything abot it, nor did they care..

Folks have to watch what they say, are nervous about vague associations they may have had 20 years previously, and have to hide relationships they should be proud of.

But its snappy and good to look at, powering with the speed of news itself through its 90 minutes. Munrow stands statuesque in face of the screen images of McCarthy's self-righteous claims against people of alledged communist persuasion. Without knowledge of Munrow I can't assess the accuracy of this portrayal, but it works in the film. The stoic crusader gets a nuanced treatment by the superb acting of Strathain. The 50s are equally evinced; the baggy duds,the lunatic advertising, the offices, a smog of cigarettes, the infant medium's techniques, by our current standards, crazily over-staffed. The film's black and white, rather like the Cohen's,'Man Who Wasn't There', helps not only the mood of the 50s, but more easily facilitates coherent dialogue with archival footage of court proceedings. If you're hungering for a complete bite into the life of Murrow or McCarthy you've come to the wrong place. The intention of the film is surely to pluck appropriate material for our times, and in this Clooney is right on target.

For the knowledgeable viewer however, no case is really made against McCarthy. The rating submitted is for the technical aspects of the movie.Certainly, George Clooney, as writer and director could not make the case honestly. Surely with all the (supposedly) thousands of victims we are told about is it really necessary to work the bogus cases discussed below into the screenplay?Milo Radulovich, discharged from the Air Force, is presented at length as a victim of McCarthy, but of course, McCarthy had nothing to do with his case. This was a security issue that was handled by the Air Force itself.Annie Lee Moss is presented as a victim of McCarthy in her appearance before the committee. Ms Moss was being questioned as a witness in trying to determine who had promoted Ms Moss, who worked in the cafeteria, to a position as a code clerk handling classified messages in the Pentagon. In McCarthy's questioning, he asks her if she's ever been a dues paying member of the Communist Party (no), whether she subscribes to the Daily Worker newspaper (no), has attended Communist party meetings (no), and so on (no,no,no). She's not very convincing in the film clips when giving her testimony, and the folks at CBS try to convince themselves that maybe one of the other Mosses in the phone book is the party in question (false). She is patronisingly presented as someone so simple as to have difficulty reading, but reading her job description reveals that she would have to be very much on the ball to fulfill the duties assigned. Four years later, of course, all the testimony she has given under oath is shown to be false (but not in the movie), and one wonders indeed who did promote Ms Moss, and why.The case of Lawrence Duggan, journalistic mentor of Murrow runs through the film, with Duggan always looking worried and nervous, until he finally commits suicide.No wonder: he was a Soviet spy, as revealed later (but not in the movie).Edward Murrow seems to look very worried a lot of the time, too. What is the meaning of the furtive glances exchanged between Murrow and Duggan? Is Clooney trying to tell us something? Did Murrow know his friend was a Soviet spy?The release of the Verona transcripts of intercepted Soviet code in 1995 provided the evidence that most all of what McCarthy said was true, and most all of what his detractors said was not.With this knowledge, it would have been more prudent for Mr Clooney to tell the story in a more ironic tone, and not retell the same old legends for the benefit of those who like to hear them.Trivia: Check the background in the original film clips of the hearings for Robert Kennedy (yes, that Robert Kennedy) - he was the junior counsel on McCarthy's committee.Addendum: After reading the meticulously documented book 'Blacklisted by History', it is patently obvious that McCarthy was destroyed by the Administration for 'outing' the practice of giving security clearances to the most egregious spies who then permeated the government and who were permitted to continue in their positions for years or allowed to resign and transfer to another government agency, or perhaps the World Bank or International Monetary Fund or the UN. Even the FBI was helpless; all their warnings and investigative reports were largely ignored or covered up.Rule #1: do not be a whistleblower: you will be destroyed.How about a movie that catches up with the now-known facts?

641817,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JOKM,Robert Moore,"[2, 5]","GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK is not the first movie to attack the George Bush era in politics by indirect means.  In 2004 M. Night Shyamalan attacked the paranoia and fear of the outside world found in Bushism in his underrated film THE VILLAGE (which modeled itself on Arthur Miller's THE CRUCIBLE).  Couching criticism of current political regimes in historical dress has a long and celebrated history.As much as I root for any film that attacks a mindset that I find reprehensible--the idea that anyone who criticizes an administration is somehow less of an American or hurting the country--I was not as impressed with this film as many of its viewers.  I very much liked the message in attacking McCarthyism-Bushism (anyone doubting that Bush was the primary target needs to hear any interview with George Clooney on the subject).  I loved the look of the film, the black and white showing to maximum effect the host of cigarettes lit in the course of the film.  I enjoyed the rich and talented ensemble cast and especially loved the main performance by the enormously talented David Strathairn.  But in the end the script did not seem to me to be especially strong.  I felt little of the dramatic tension that I had hoped and expected to experience.  I felt that the script in the end lacked focus and sufficient tension.  It was nonetheless a very good film; I was hoping for a great one.I have been a huge fan of David Strathairn for years, even since I first noticed him in John Sayles's great film MATEWAN and in subsequent films by Sayles.  Few filmmakers other than Sayles seems to have appreciated his gifts and until this film few have given him the kind of role his talent would seem to command.  He neither looks very much like Murrow nor does he sound very much like him (unlike, say, Philip Seymour Hoffman who doesn't so much imitate Truman Capote as incarnate him, albeit in a much taller version), but he does summon the spirit of the man.  He has the same kind of moral seriousness Murrow always managed.  I also like the idea of summoning the ghost of Murrow, easily the most respected journalist in the history of TV, to confront the spirit of the times.  Murrow would not only have detested the Bush administration with every ounce of his being, he would have been outraged by the utter decay of journalistic integrity and a world in which FOX News was not an automatic joke.A minor point of personal pride:  I grew up in Arkansas and attended the John L. McClellan High School in Little Rock.  One of the few people with sufficient nerve to stand up to McCarthy was John L. McClellan.  The film features an extensive archival footage featuring a long interchange between McCarthy and McClellan, the latter obviously outraged by McCarthy's excesses.  If one looks carefully, one will see a very young John F. Kennedy sitting beside McClellan.",4,An excellent piece of political filmmaking,1133395200,"12 1, 2005",2005,2862,"['GOOD', 'NIGHT', 'AND', 'GOOD', 'LUCK', 'not', 'first', 'movie', 'attack', 'George', 'Bush', 'era', 'politics', 'indirect', 'means', '2004', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'attacked', 'paranoia', 'fear', 'outside', 'world', 'found', 'Bushism', 'underrated', 'film', 'THE', 'VILLAGE', 'modeled', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'THE', 'CRUCIBLE', 'Couching', 'criticism', 'current', 'political', 'regimes', 'historical', 'dress', 'long', 'celebrated', 'history.As', 'much', 'root', 'film', 'mindset', 'find', 'reprehensible', 'idea', 'anyone', 'who', 'administration', 'somehow', 'less', 'American', 'hurting', 'country', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'film', 'many', 'viewers', 'very', 'much', 'liked', 'message', 'attacking', 'McCarthyism-Bushism', 'anyone', 'doubting', 'Bush', 'was', 'primary', 'target', 'needs', 'hear', 'interview', 'George', 'Clooney', 'subject', 'loved', 'look', 'film', 'black', 'white', 'showing', 'maximum', 'effect', 'host', 'cigarettes', 'lit', 'course', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'rich', 'talented', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'especially', 'loved', 'main', 'performance', 'enormously', 'talented', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'end', 'script', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'especially', 'strong', 'felt', 'little', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'had', 'hoped', 'expected', 'experience', 'felt', 'script', 'end', 'lacked', 'focus', 'sufficient', 'tension', 'was', 'nonetheless', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'was', 'hoping', 'great', 'one.I', 'have', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'years', 'even', 'first', 'noticed', 'John', 'Sayles', 'great', 'film', 'MATEWAN', 'subsequent', 'films', 'Sayles', 'Few', 'filmmakers', 'other', 'Sayles', 'have', 'appreciated', 'gifts', 'film', 'few', 'have', 'given', 'kind', 'role', 'talent', 'would', 'seem', 'command', 'very', 'much', 'Murrow', 'sound', 'very', 'much', 'say', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'who', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'imitate', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'incarnate', 'albeit', 'much', 'taller', 'version', 'summon', 'spirit', 'man', 'same', 'kind', 'moral', 'seriousness', 'Murrow', 'always', 'managed', 'also', 'like', 'idea', 'summoning', 'ghost', 'Murrow', 'easily', 'most', 'respected', 'journalist', 'history', 'TV', 'confront', 'spirit', 'times', 'Murrow', 'would', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'detested', 'Bush', 'administration', 'ounce', 'being', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'outraged', 'utter', 'decay', 'journalistic', 'integrity', 'world', 'FOX', 'News', 'was', 'not', 'automatic', 'joke.A', 'minor', 'point', 'personal', 'pride', 'grew', 'up', 'Arkansas', 'attended', 'John', 'L.', 'McClellan', 'High', 'School', 'Little', 'Rock', 'One', 'few', 'people', 'sufficient', 'nerve', 'stand', 'up', 'McCarthy', 'was', 'John', 'L.', 'McClellan', 'film', 'extensive', 'archival', 'footage', 'featuring', 'long', 'interchange', 'McCarthy', 'McClellan', 'latter', 'obviously', 'outraged', 'McCarthy', 'excesses', 'one', 'carefully', 'one', 'will', 'see', 'very', 'young', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'sitting', 'beside', 'McClellan']",N/A
641818,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B00005JOKM,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[7, 14]","Using black-white film, director-actor George Clooney (who makes an appearance as `Fred Friendly') has audiences consider the dangers of an unrestrained government---and the important role truly independent journalists play in protecting democracies.After World War II, the 'red menace' was considered the next great threat to American democracy. During the 1950's, very few people wanted to appear as being for communism; subsequently it was thought that no measure was too extreme to end communism.Enter a politically calculating young Senator from Wisconsin-Joseph McCarthy. McCarthy quickly makes a national name for himself by announcing that he has lists of communists who are in government, and the nation needs to follow him if they want to stop 'them'.  Among them is Milo Radulovich, an Air Force officer who, after secret accusations about his patriotism were made and he refused to denounce his father and sister, was drummed out of the service.Because no actor was cast to play McCarthy's thankless role, the film reacts to woven-in vintage clips of McCarthy himself. This also saves Clooney and the rest of the cast on the off chance that McCarthy's few remaining admirers want to charge Hollywood with 'twisting' his words.Against McCarthy's witchunt, Edward R. Murrow had the conviction to publicly call the Senator on his actions during an episode of his talk show ""See it Now"". In 1954 the veteran news journalist openly challenged McCarthy's allegations of communism being entrenched throughout United States society, the Radulovich allegations had offended him because a servicemember was asked to attack his own family.  Effectively ending McCarthy's reign of terror upon the American people, that investigation also championed the constitutional rights of all citizens.Foreshadowing Watergate, Murrow also proved that dedicated and professional journalists act as a much-needed fourth check on government actions and power.He receives critical backup from CBS News producer Fred Friendly (George Clooney doing double duty) and executive William Paley (Frank Langella). These are moves which I honestly believe would not be duplicated in today's TV newsrooms even with everything that goes on during our own time. Despite public criticism about the `liberal media' these journalists are trained to avoid offending their corporate owners and caretakers. People of all political ideologies will continue finding Murrow's professional integrity refreshing because he was only committed to delivering the facts of a story.Clooney and the rest of the crew/cast did an excellent job with period clothing, music, and mannerisms (Robert Downey Jr and Patricia Clarkson are a married couple in an era when workplace marriages are formally prohibited `just because') but the film's powerful message easily resonates with the current issues in our modern society. I am really impressed with the time and care George Clooney gave to this film.",5,Special news report: Murrow takes on McCarthy in this fall's must see film,1129334400,"10 15, 2005",2005,2952,"['Using', 'black-white', 'film', 'director-actor', 'George', 'Clooney', 'who', 'appearance', 'Fred', 'Friendly', 'audiences', 'consider', 'dangers', 'unrestrained', 'government', '-and', 'important', 'role', 'truly', 'independent', 'journalists', 'play', 'protecting', 'democracies.After', 'World', 'War', 'II', ""'red"", 'menace', 'was', 'considered', 'next', 'great', 'threat', 'American', 'democracy', '1950', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'wanted', 'appear', 'being', 'communism', 'subsequently', 'was', 'thought', 'measure', 'was', 'too', 'extreme', 'end', 'communism.Enter', 'politically', 'calculating', 'young', 'Senator', 'Wisconsin-Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'McCarthy', 'quickly', 'national', 'name', 'announcing', 'lists', 'communists', 'who', 'are', 'government', 'nation', 'follow', 'want', 'stop', ""'them"", 'Milo', 'Radulovich', 'Air', 'Force', 'officer', 'who', 'secret', 'accusations', 'patriotism', 'were', 'made', 'refused', 'denounce', 'father', 'sister', 'was', 'drummed', 'service.Because', 'actor', 'was', 'cast', 'play', 'McCarthy', 'thankless', 'role', 'film', 'woven-in', 'vintage', 'clips', 'McCarthy', 'also', 'Clooney', 'rest', 'cast', 'off', 'chance', 'McCarthy', 'few', 'remaining', 'admirers', 'want', 'charge', 'Hollywood', ""'twisting"", 'words.Against', 'McCarthy', 'witchunt', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'had', 'conviction', 'publicly', 'call', 'Senator', 'actions', 'episode', 'talk', 'show', 'See', 'Now', '1954', 'veteran', 'news', 'journalist', 'openly', 'challenged', 'McCarthy', 'allegations', 'communism', 'being', 'entrenched', 'United', 'States', 'society', 'Radulovich', 'allegations', 'had', 'offended', 'servicemember', 'was', 'asked', 'attack', 'own', 'family', 'Effectively', 'ending', 'McCarthy', 'reign', 'terror', 'American', 'people', 'investigation', 'also', 'championed', 'constitutional', 'rights', 'citizens.Foreshadowing', 'Watergate', 'Murrow', 'also', 'proved', 'dedicated', 'professional', 'journalists', 'act', 'much-needed', 'fourth', 'check', 'government', 'actions', 'power.He', 'receives', 'critical', 'backup', 'CBS', 'News', 'producer', 'Fred', 'Friendly', 'George', 'Clooney', 'doing', 'double', 'duty', 'executive', 'William', 'Paley', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'are', 'moves', 'honestly', 'believe', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'duplicated', 'today', 'TV', 'newsrooms', 'even', 'everything', 'own', 'time', 'public', 'criticism', 'liberal', 'media', 'journalists', 'are', 'trained', 'avoid', 'offending', 'corporate', 'owners', 'caretakers', 'People', 'political', 'ideologies', 'will', 'continue', 'finding', 'Murrow', 'professional', 'integrity', 'refreshing', 'was', 'only', 'committed', 'delivering', 'facts', 'story.Clooney', 'rest', 'crew/cast', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'period', 'clothing', 'music', 'mannerisms', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'are', 'married', 'couple', 'era', 'when', 'workplace', 'marriages', 'are', 'formally', 'prohibited', 'just', 'film', 'powerful', 'message', 'easily', 'current', 'issues', 'modern', 'society', 'am', 'really', 'impressed', 'time', 'care', 'George', 'Clooney', 'gave', 'film']",N/A

It will be attacked for being filmed in black and white and entirely indoors. But these complaints should not make the potential viewer think that this movie is not worth the watching. That is incredibly wrong.GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK captures a piece of time which is rapidly moving from current events to history. This is sad. The great Edward R. Murrow's meritorious dedication to the integrity of journalism is fast fading from the American memory. And while GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK only examines one aspect of his long career, what an aspect it is! Murrow's pit-bull grip to bring down the infamous Joseph McCarthy was probably the highlight of his career. (Unfortunately, it also relegated both men to the ""back row"" of their professions, in the long run.) Some people have read about how political cartoonist, Thomas Nast, brought down Boss Tweed in the 19th Century. Some people remember how Woodward and Bernstein were an integral part of forcing Nixon out of office. But this journalist's contribution to restoring sanity to America during the 1950s is hardly remembered, and not at all talked about in schools (unless you take a journalism class--and that's maybe!)The performances are wonderful. Strathairn IS Edward R. Murrows: remarkably understated and still very intense. George Clooney, as Fred Friendly, is his perfect foil--very extroverted and constantly joking. It was good to see Robert Downey Jr. take such a serious role, again. His portrayal of Chaplin is the last serious thing I think he did. Jeff Daniels was perfectly cast as the tooth grinding stuffed shirt, and Frank Langella was on-the-money as the powerful William Paley, owner of CBS.My only negative comment concerns the amount of time spent on the love affair between Downey and Patricia Clarkson. It really leads to an anticlimactic conclusion. The time would've been better spent helping younger viewers with some more exposition and gathering more sympathy for Ray Wise's Dan Hollenbeck, who was as much a target of the McCarthy sycophants as anyone else. (I would have also enjoyed more time watching McCarthy being brought down.) Still, this should BY NO MEANS prevent from watching this important film.

Zwick,"[2, 4]","***1/2Although set in the past - at the height of the Army-McCarthy hearings of the 1950's - ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" has a great deal of relevance to the world of today. For in an era in which civil liberties are again under attack due to a perceived threat to national security, and political opponents are labeled as ""unpatriotic"" and ""soft on terror"" merely for disagreeing with the powers-that-be in the government, this film reminds us of just how precious and vital disagreement and dissent are to the health of a democracy. The modern-day parallels are never far from the mind of director and co-writer George Clooney as he tells the true-life story of famed CBS reporter Edward R. Murrow's courageous attacks on Senator Joseph McCarthy during the politically charged era known as the Red Scare.This film is reminiscent of ""All the President's Men"" in its austerity and lack of narrative adornment. Filmed in period-appropriate black-and-white, ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" spends virtually no time on exploring the personal lives of the characters, choosing instead to stay entirely focused on the drama at hand. This has both a positive and a negative effect on the film. On the plus side, the film doesn't become distracted by secondary issues or wander off into irrelevant narrative by-paths. Yet, the film has an almost hermetically sealed quality to it in that we rarely leave the highly insulated world of the CBS studios. As a result, the movie sometimes feels as it it's choking on its own lack of oxygen, not providing sufficient room for the characters themselves to breathe and grow. Morrow, the host of ""See it Now"" whose signature sign-off becomes the basis for the film's title, delivers his pointed speeches and the men and women around him debate the issues of the day, but we really don't get to know any of them as people in the way we would like (compare it to a film such as ""Quiz Show"" which did manage to bring a three-dimensional quality to its characters).What the film does do very well is to point out the hypocrisy at work in McCarthy's witch hunt tactics, for apparently he couldn't see - or perhaps chose not to see - that, in his squelching of dissent and his terrorizing of those with political views opposite to his own, he was aping the very Communists he claimed to be reviling, becoming an even greater threat to true American values than those he despised.The performances - particularly by David Straitharn as Morrow - are good, but the overall lack of characterization makes ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" more interesting as a history lesson and an allegory for today than as a full-fledged drama.",3,historically interesting but a bit stiff and airless,1153180800,"07 18, 2006",2006,2644,"['***1/2Although', 'set', 'past', 'height', 'Army-McCarthy', 'hearings', '1950', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'great', 'deal', 'relevance', 'world', 'today', 'era', 'civil', 'liberties', 'are', 'again', 'attack', 'due', 'perceived', 'threat', 'national', 'security', 'political', 'opponents', 'are', 'labeled', 'unpatriotic', 'soft', 'terror', 'merely', 'disagreeing', 'powers-that-be', 'government', 'film', 'just', 'how', 'precious', 'vital', 'disagreement', 'dissent', 'are', 'health', 'democracy', 'modern-day', 'parallels', 'are', 'never', 'far', 'mind', 'director', 'co-writer', 'George', 'Clooney', 'true-life', 'story', 'famed', 'CBS', 'reporter', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'courageous', 'attacks', 'Senator', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'politically', 'charged', 'era', 'known', 'Red', 'Scare.This', 'film', 'reminiscent', 'President', 'Men', 'austerity', 'lack', 'narrative', 'adornment', 'Filmed', 'period-appropriate', 'black-and-white', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'virtually', 'time', 'exploring', 'personal', 'lives', 'characters', 'choosing', 'instead', 'stay', 'entirely', 'focused', 'drama', 'hand', 'positive', 'negative', 'effect', 'film', 'plus', 'side', 'film', ""n't"", 'become', 'distracted', 'secondary', 'issues', 'wander', 'off', 'irrelevant', 'narrative', 'by-paths', 'film', 'almost', 'hermetically', 'sealed', 'quality', 'rarely', 'leave', 'highly', 'insulated', 'world', 'CBS', 'studios', 'result', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'choking', 'own', 'lack', 'oxygen', 'not', 'providing', 'sufficient', 'room', 'characters', 'breathe', 'grow', 'Morrow', 'host', 'See', 'Now', 'signature', 'sign-off', 'basis', 'film', 'title', 'pointed', 'speeches', 'men', 'women', 'debate', 'issues', 'day', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'people', 'way', 'would', 'like', 'compare', 'film', 'such', 'Quiz', 'Show', 'did', 'manage', 'bring', 'three-dimensional', 'quality', 'characters', '.What', 'film', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'point', 'out', 'hypocrisy', 'work', 'McCarthy', 'witch', 'hunt', 'tactics', 'apparently', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'perhaps', 'chose', 'not', 'see', 'squelching', 'dissent', 'terrorizing', 'political', 'views', 'opposite', 'own', 'was', 'aping', 'very', 'claimed', 'be', 'reviling', 'becoming', 'even', 'greater', 'threat', 'true', 'American', 'values', 'despised.The', 'performances', 'particularly', 'David', 'Straitharn', 'Morrow', 'are', 'good', 'overall', 'lack', 'characterization', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'more', 'interesting', 'history', 'lesson', 'allegory', 'today', 'full-fledged', 'drama']",N/A

And ""Good Night"" got such good reviews. But the movie just didn't come to life for me.David Strathairn portrays not so much a serious Edward R. Murrow, as a ponderous, leaden one - weighted with a sense of unrelieved doom. He speaks in deep overcast. He walks stiffly down corridors as if walking his last mile.The best performance is turned in by Ray Wise as Don Hollenbeck, a member of Murrow's broadcast team who in fact was doomed, but who fought to put on a brave front. As he stands there, trying to be one of the boys, you can see how essentially isolated he is by his private demons.George Clooney directs some scenes in imitation of Altman technique. For swatches, the actors talk in rapid, overlapping dialogue. But it doesn't work here as it did for Altman. Instead of adding energy and layering to these scenes, the technique only needlessly drowns what's being said.Clooney made an uneasy mix of this film in general. It's part documentary, relying heavily on actual footage of McCarthy. And it's part drama. But the result is not a happy hybrid docudrama. The result is a fractured mirror.When I looked to Clooney's DVD commentary to perhaps polish down some of the sharp edges, I found only a distracting goofiness. The first couple of times Clooney interjects, ""Look, there's the sexiest man alive,"" as he comes on the screen in the role of Fred Friendly, it may be sort of amusing. But his repeated self-mocking quickly gets old.My father bought our first TV set so that he could watch the Army-McCarthy hearings. I was too young to really understand what was going on, but I remember sitting mesmerized in front of the screen. Joseph Welch, Attorney for the Army, became my hero as he countered McCarthy's increasingly scatter-gun ravings with calm reproof. And I later had a sense of Murrow as a Lincolnesque figure, delivering plainly reasoned eloquence in the face of what could have been the madness of crowds.If you want to know about Murrow and his colleagues and their bravery, if you want to know what the McCarthy hearings were all about - go to the several excellent straight documentaries that are available. Go to videos of the original broadcasts. In this case, the documentary can stand on its own.

641829,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B00005JOKM,Samuel McKewon,"[1, 4]","""Good Night, And Good Luck"" is George Clooney's love letter to the America of his 1950s childhood as much as it is an anthem to the journalism of that era and its figurehead, Edward R. Murrow. The opening sequence, at an evening gala of wine, smoke, women of a sophisticated age and men of a professional dignity, reveals as much.Did adults enjoy themselves more in those days? Maybe, to the  neglect of their children, who became our Angriest Generation a decade later. Is this a shamelessly romantic picture? Absolutely. Does it immerse itself the complexities of Murrow's 1954 takedown of Sen. Joe McCarthy and his Communist investigations? Not really. But I enjoyed it as I would enjoy a well-made film that appreciated the sunny idealism Ronald Reagan in the face of his rotten politics. There are far worse things than a picture about serious people considering serious things seriously.Consider how Clooney and actor David Strathairn - excellent here - portray Murrow, host of the CBS news program ""See It Now,"" as a man who reveres words so much - and trusts his audience to understand - he dignifies them. He tells his audience, in one episode of his news program of ""See It Now,""that he will read from a paper so as not to be mistaken. Before technology ever overwhelmed viewers with visual clutter - we're to the point where Bill O'Reilly uses a graphic summarize his key points - content and image were married in a way that required clarity and eloquence. Murrow delivered commentary without putting quotation marks around it.While we get the gist of the McCarthy hearings, ""Good Night, And Good Luck"" does not have the budget or epic goals of ""All The President's Men,"" ""The Insider"" to relive the experience. For 45 years McCarthy - shown in the movie through real footage as a sweaty, furious troll of a man, a squinty-eyed balloon about to pop - was remembered as a zealot bent destroying ordinary Americans (and a lot of people in Hollywood) for minor or nonexistent connections to the Communist Party. Then conversative author Ann Coulter, among others, launched a vigorous defense of his hearings. The footage Clooney uses doesn't leave much doubt to me that McCarthy was about ready to start carving numbers in his wrist like John Forbes Nash, but then it's selective footage. Books - including Coulter's - offer better examinations, as do the movies ""Guilty by Suspicion"" and ""Citizen Cohn.""Clooney is after the essence of living in slight paranoia. One CBS news anchor, Don Hollenbeck (Ray Wise) commits suicide, partially for the relentless criticism he gets for being a ""Communist sympathizer"" on TV. One of the men who is part of the ""See It Now"" team has to remove himself from the McCarthy project because his ex-wife attended meetings long ago. ""We have to do this,"" Murrow says in reference to McCarthy stories, ""because it cuts to right here in this room.""A classy supporting cast (including Clooney, Robert Downey, Jeff Daniels, Frank Langella and Tate Donovan) portray a bright, committed news team, aware of Murrow's talent, command, and reserved leadership. Strathairn makes several acting choices in the way he smokes cigarettes - a manner of expression back then. And Clooney, as he showed in ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,"" is a talented filmmaker in basic ways - camera placement, lighting, composition, creativity. He integrates footage from ""See It Now,"" ""Person To Person,"" old commericials and the hearing themselves. He also recreates the old Columbia music recording studios that were once next door to the news floor. He inserts a few 50s standards from these  sessions as scene transitions. The effect is poignant and elegant. So is his movie.",4,A warm flood of American idealism,1131753600,"11 12, 2005",2005,3693,"['Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'George', 'Clooney', 'love', 'letter', 'America', '1950s', 'childhood', 'as', 'much', 'anthem', 'journalism', 'era', 'figurehead', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'opening', 'sequence', 'evening', 'gala', 'wine', 'smoke', 'women', 'sophisticated', 'age', 'men', 'professional', 'dignity', 'reveals', 'much.Did', 'adults', 'enjoy', 'more', 'days', 'Maybe', 'neglect', 'children', 'who', 'became', 'Angriest', 'Generation', 'decade', 'later', 'shamelessly', 'romantic', 'picture', 'Absolutely', 'immerse', 'complexities', 'Murrow', '1954', 'takedown', 'Sen.', 'Joe', 'McCarthy', 'Communist', 'investigations', 'Not', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'would', 'enjoy', 'well-made', 'film', 'appreciated', 'sunny', 'idealism', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'face', 'rotten', 'politics', 'are', 'far', 'worse', 'things', 'picture', 'serious', 'people', 'considering', 'serious', 'things', 'seriously.Consider', 'how', 'Clooney', 'actor', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'excellent', 'here', 'portray', 'Murrow', 'host', 'CBS', 'news', 'program', 'See', 'Now', 'man', 'who', 'words', 'so', 'much', 'audience', 'understand', 'audience', 'one', 'episode', 'news', 'program', 'See', 'Now', 'will', 'read', 'paper', 'so', 'not', 'be', 'mistaken', 'technology', 'ever', 'overwhelmed', 'viewers', 'visual', 'clutter', ""'re"", 'point', 'where', 'Bill', ""O'Reilly"", 'graphic', 'summarize', 'key', 'points', 'content', 'image', 'were', 'married', 'way', 'required', 'clarity', 'eloquence', 'Murrow', 'delivered', 'commentary', 'putting', 'quotation', 'marks', 'get', 'gist', 'McCarthy', 'hearings', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'not', 'have', 'budget', 'epic', 'goals', 'President', 'Men', 'Insider', 'relive', 'experience', '45', 'years', 'McCarthy', 'shown', 'movie', 'real', 'footage', 'sweaty', 'furious', 'troll', 'man', 'squinty-eyed', 'balloon', 'pop', 'was', 'remembered', 'zealot', 'bent', 'destroying', 'ordinary', 'Americans', 'lot', 'people', 'Hollywood', 'minor', 'nonexistent', 'connections', 'Communist', 'Party', 'Then', 'conversative', 'author', 'Ann', 'Coulter', 'others', 'launched', 'vigorous', 'defense', 'hearings', 'footage', 'Clooney', ""n't"", 'leave', 'much', 'doubt', 'McCarthy', 'was', 'about', 'ready', 'start', 'carving', 'numbers', 'wrist', 'John', 'Forbes', 'Nash', 'then', 'selective', 'footage', 'Books', 'including', 'Coulter', 'offer', 'better', 'examinations', 'do', 'movies', 'Guilty', 'Suspicion', 'Citizen', 'Cohn', 'Clooney', 'essence', 'living', 'slight', 'paranoia', 'One', 'CBS', 'news', 'anchor', 'Don', 'Hollenbeck', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'suicide', 'partially', 'relentless', 'criticism', 'being', 'Communist', 'sympathizer', 'TV', 'One', 'men', 'who', 'part', 'See', 'Now', 'team', 'remove', 'McCarthy', 'project', 'ex-wife', 'attended', 'meetings', 'long', 'ago', 'have', 'do', 'Murrow', 'reference', 'McCarthy', 'stories', 'right', 'here', 'room', 'classy', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Clooney', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'Tate', 'Donovan', 'portray', 'bright', 'committed', 'news', 'team', 'aware', 'Murrow', 'talent', 'command', 'reserved', 'leadership', 'Strathairn', 'several', 'acting', 'choices', 'way', 'cigarettes', 'manner', 'expression', 'back', 'then', 'Clooney', 'showed', 'Confessions', 'Dangerous', 'Mind', 'talented', 'filmmaker', 'basic', 'ways', 'camera', 'placement', 'lighting', 'composition', 'creativity', 'footage', 'See', 'Now', 'Person', 'Person', 'old', 'commericials', 'hearing', 'also', 'old', 'Columbia', 'music', 'recording', 'studios', 'were', 'once', 'next', 'door', 'news', 'floor', 'few', '50s', 'standards', 'sessions', 'scene', 'transitions', 'effect', 'poignant', 'elegant', 'movie']",N/A

I thought it would be boring but I actually found it quite fascinating and would rate it my favorite of the group.The story concerns Edward R. Murrow and his epic battle against the communist witch hunts of Senator Joseph McCarthy. It takes place in the fifties, during the heart of the cold war, when fear of communism was at its greatest. Nobody was better than McCarthy at inflaming this fear and it is scary to think about how much power he was able to accumulate in the process. Putting an end to the hysteria required someone of unshakable courage and principal. Fortunately for us, Edward R. Murrow was such a man. He had become a national hero during World War II by reporting from London while [...] bombs burst all around him. Risking his career and reputation, by potentially being labeled a communist sympathizer, Murrow used his weekly television show to bring McCarthy's unjustified attacks into America's living rooms. It is a classic example of why we need a free press. Anyone wondering why we put up with a sensationalist, sometimes annoying media should see this film. The movie ends with a warning, with Murrow telling us that the press must never forget its primary role as informer rather than entertainer. This is a sobering observation, given how entertainment oriented and slanted much of the media has become.Murrow is played perfectly by David Strathairn, who deftly exudes Murrow's laser like attack on McCarthy. Strathairn looks like Murrow, he talks like him and he even smokes like him. Murrow was known to smoke on the air while he broadcasted to America. This film was directed by George Clooney and if it is any indication, I will look forward to his next project with great anticipation. Clooney, who up until now I have associated with shallow popcorn movies, has created something of great intelligence and maturity with this film. It not only addresses serious social issues but he gives us a taste of what life was like in our past. The music, clothing and old news footage make this as much a period piece as anything else. Like many actor-directors, such as Woody Allen and Clint Eastwood, Clooney puts himself into the film but unlike his colleagues he doesn't make himself the star. Clooney plays a nicely understated Fred Friendly, Murrow's producer and close friend. Clooney acts well, and so do Robert Downey Junior, Jeff Daniels and many others but in my opinion this was Strathairn's movie.",5,Gave me a whole new respect for the press and George Clooney,1147737600,"05 16, 2006",2006,2533,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'slowly', 'working', 'way', 'Oscar', 'class', '2005', 'saved', 'one', 'last', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'boring', 'actually', 'found', 'quite', 'fascinating', 'would', 'rate', 'favorite', 'group.The', 'story', 'concerns', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'epic', 'battle', 'communist', 'witch', 'hunts', 'Senator', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'place', 'fifties', 'heart', 'cold', 'war', 'when', 'fear', 'communism', 'was', 'greatest', 'Nobody', 'was', 'better', 'McCarthy', 'inflaming', 'fear', 'scary', 'think', 'how', 'much', 'power', 'was', 'able', 'accumulate', 'process', 'Putting', 'end', 'hysteria', 'required', 'someone', 'unshakable', 'courage', 'principal', 'Fortunately', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'was', 'such', 'man', 'had', 'become', 'national', 'hero', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'reporting', 'London', '[', ']', 'bombs', 'burst', 'Risking', 'career', 'reputation', 'potentially', 'being', 'labeled', 'communist', 'sympathizer', 'Murrow', 'used', 'weekly', 'television', 'show', 'bring', 'McCarthy', 'unjustified', 'attacks', 'America', 'living', 'rooms', 'classic', 'example', 'why', 'need', 'free', 'press', 'Anyone', 'wondering', 'why', 'put', 'up', 'sensationalist', 'sometimes', 'annoying', 'media', 'should', 'see', 'film', 'movie', 'warning', 'Murrow', 'telling', 'press', 'must', 'never', 'forget', 'primary', 'role', 'informer', 'rather', 'entertainer', 'sobering', 'observation', 'given', 'how', 'entertainment', 'oriented', 'slanted', 'much', 'media', 'become.Murrow', 'played', 'perfectly', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'who', 'deftly', 'Murrow', 'laser', 'attack', 'McCarthy', 'Strathairn', 'Murrow', 'even', 'Murrow', 'was', 'known', 'smoke', 'air', 'broadcasted', 'America', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'George', 'Clooney', 'indication', 'will', 'look', 'forward', 'next', 'project', 'great', 'anticipation', 'Clooney', 'who', 'now', 'have', 'associated', 'shallow', 'popcorn', 'movies', 'created', 'something', 'great', 'intelligence', 'maturity', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'serious', 'social', 'issues', 'taste', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'past', 'music', 'clothing', 'old', 'news', 'footage', 'make', 'much', 'period', 'piece', 'anything', 'else', 'many', 'actor-directors', 'such', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Clooney', 'film', 'colleagues', ""n't"", 'make', 'star', 'Clooney', 'nicely', 'understated', 'Fred', 'Friendly', 'Murrow', 'producer', 'close', 'friend', 'Clooney', 'well', 'so', 'do', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Junior', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'many', 'others', 'opinion', 'was', 'Strathairn', 'movie']",N/A
641835,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B00005JOKM,Scott Schiefelbein,"[0, 0]","George Clooney's ""Good Night and Good Luck"" gets high marks almost entirely across the board - the movie looks and sounds great, reeks of authenticity, and has more affection for the newsroom than any movie since ""All the President's Men.""  But the movie lacks that head-to-head showdown that makes for truly great drama.I won't reiterate the hundreds of reviews that comment on the movie's stellar cast, cinematography, or timeliness - if you aren't familiar with those aspects of ""Good Night and Good Luck,"" I'd probably also have to tell you who Harry Potter is. I will focus on the movie's main calculated risk - using actual archival footage of Joe McCarthy rather than an actor.  This choice gets high marks for originality and veracity, but it comes at the expense of drama.The Joe McCarthy of the old celluloids just isn't a quality foil for Edward R. Murrow, as played by David Strathairn.  The movie depicts Murrow lovingly, zooming in for dramatic close-ups and generally lionizing the man as the epitome of the good citizen-journalist.  Conversely, McCarthy comes across as flat, stilted, and a completely unworthy opponent.  While the name ""McCarthy"" is invoked several times in the movie with paranoia and revulsion, the archival footage of the man doesn't back it up.  It would have been a better choice to have an actor equivalent to Strathairn get an equally ominous cinematic treatment.This is in contrast to the decision in ""All the President's Men"" to have Nixon and his cronies virtually completely off-screen.  Nixon was an invisible presence in that movie, and was genuinely creepy.  It's also like the movie ""Jaws.""  There are a couple of flash-scenes at the end where Spielberg includes actual footage of a great white shark, and it's obviously smaller than the monster depicted in the movie.  Spielberg included it to show the shark turning quickly, which his big terrifying model could not do.  This shot, while accurate, isn't nearly as terrifying as the mechanical shark's other appearances.Accordingly, we are denied a great pay-off scene in ""Good Night and Good Luck"" where McCarthy's fortunes crumble around him.  Instead, we get the archival footage of the ""have you no shame, Senator"" moment, and it just seems a bit flat.Despite this quibble, ""Good Night and Good Luck"" is a fine movie of ambition and art, and deserves to be seen.

Had the film been in the theaters a few years back it would've seem to be about mistakes past. In  the present day however there are a lot of analogs with how the Bush administration handles the war on terror and the atmosphere it created in society.The McCarthy era with and the House Un-American Activities Committee were a period in time of extreme polarization in the US. Prior to the fifties there had been a lively debate in America about the place of socialism in American society. Where in Europe this debate resulted in a strong welfare state the US took another direction. Under pressure of the cold war and a much stronger belief in capitalism everything slightly associated with communism became suspect. Socialism was seen as a threat to the American way of life and had to be fought on all grounds. All though it was never illegal in America to be a socialist or communist, the McCarthy hearings made one an outlaw none the less. People in public life who were suspected of ""red"" sympathies found their lives destroyed when branded a commie. This happened not just to those in public life. While ""commie"" actors were vicariously hunted regular people suffered as well. Being suspected of communism meant the loss of work and becoming a social outcast.The analogs to this day and age are clear. With the strong line on terror and military action as an answer to that the Bush administration once again managed to create a big cleavage in American society. With his ""you're either with u or against us"" dogma the Bush administration has once again made everyone disagreeing suspect. In this day and age the government has anti-terror laws to back them up and create an atmosphere of paranoia. Although supposedly meant to protect American citizens already the anti-terror laws made it possible to incarcerate people without due trial on suspecting of terrorist activities or sympathies to them. Especially Arab-Americans have become victims to these laws but other American citizens as well. Peace movement have been infiltrated by intelligent services and authors or journalist have found it difficult to get their books and articles published out of fear of retaliation.In a clever move George Clooney steered clear of present day McCarthy-ism by making a film of a victim of the McCarthy-era. This allows him to hold a mirror to the face of America. Clooney shows us an era we've all begun to see as un-American. It's up to the audience to find the analogs with today. However in showing the paranoia of the McCarthy era the film only mildly succeeds. In the movie he chooses to show us someone who managed to stand up to McCarthy in a time the hearings were already heavily debated. Although the story is beautifully told and powerfully filmed Clooney could have made a stronger point by showing us how at the beginning of the era careers and lives were torn down.

However, the film takes an entirely too simplistic moral view of its subject, it fails to acknowledge the paranoia of the period and has the benefit of hindsight. Additionally, the film makes CBS and Murrow's efforts more heroic then they actually were, Senator McCarthy certainly didn't have as much power as the entire CBS Corporation, and the journalists who brought him down weren't really risking as much as the film implies.

641847,A1LTJCQGRPTOTD,B00005JOKM,STEPHEN T. McCARTHY,"[31, 92]","George Clooney's GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK is a beautifully looking movie.  It employs sharp, aesthetically appropriate black and white photography in order to capture the 1950s black and white television era, and to imaginatively incorporate period footage of Senator Joseph McCarthy and people related to the events for which he was famous.  The cinematography and editing is first-rate, a real feast for the eyes, and I enjoyed the Ella-esque mid-century Jazz score.  Clooney's movie is essentially a hagiography of the nearly humorless newsman, EDWARD R. MURROW, played so woodenly by David Strathairn as to make Pinocchio seem like Gumby by comparison.  (It may have been an accurate portrayal of his personality, but it doesn't exactly make for captivating viewing.)  There were a couple of nice performances in the movie, most notable is Frank Langella in the role of William Paley; he had some real charisma.Speaking strictly visually, the movie's a winner, but GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK opens in 1958 at a banquet given to honor the television news commentator, MURROW.  (It's one of those types of affairs that my dear departed friend, Marty, once referred to as ""a bunch of ###holes patting themselves on the back."")  Of the many singularly wondrous works of Murrow that we're informed of, one is that ""He threw stones at giants ... not the least of which, his historical fight with Senator McCarthy.""  So, Murrow was David versus Goliath, eh?  As McCarthy's chief counsel, Roy Cohn, wrote in his great book, McCARTHY: ""All we had against us was the White House, the administration, the Democratic party, and the Republican party.""  Wanna talk David and Goliath?  So, enough about the movie's artistic attributes, let's talk FACTS since this is a one-sided demagogic attack on the dead Senator who was himself often labeled a demagogue by the print and broadcast media:Our 1958 honoree tells his audience we need to get off our collective rear end and ""recognize that television in the main is being used to distract, delude, amuse and insulate us.""  Well, guess what.  It was, and still is!  And so are magazines and movies ... just like THIS one.  GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK (GN&GL;) is simply more of Hollywood's Socialistic brainwashing of Americonned citizens.  (We are told in this movie that in the 1950s, Kent cigarettes filtered best; Liberace was giving thought to marriage; and McCarthy was slandering completely innocent people and ruining their reputations and their lives.  Each one of those statements is only as true as the next.)GN&GL; touches on the most famous moments in the McCarthy ""Communist Hunt.""  (He was looking for Communists who had infiltrated sensitive departments of our government and who were being protected from exposure and removal by highly-placed government officials.  Contrary to popular belief, he was NOT hunting witches.)  But unless the viewer is familiar with the history, he or she will not likely grasp the relevance of certain details.Murrow insists that ""ninety-nine percent of the time"", McCarthy is wrong about the people he names as being security risks.  Do you know what became of the 110 people in the State Department who McCarthy named before the Tydings Committee (but did not name publicly) as possible security risks?  (Pardon me, I forgot that you're an Americonned citizen.  Here's an easer question for you:  Who got kicked off SURVIVOR last week?)  Well, 81 of those people were eventually dismissed or resigned from government service due to their Communist affiliations.  Mr. Murrow, that's nearly 74% proven right, not 99% wrong!  (And here I thought I was bad at math.)Watching GN&GL;, the Americonned viewer will come away with the idea that the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) was falsely accused by McCarthy of being a subversive Communist front organization.  Yes, the same ACLU founded by Roger Baldwin, who served as its executive director for 30 years, and who wrote 12 years after founding the organization: ""I seek the social ownership of property, the abolition of the propertied class and sole control of those who produce wealth.  Communism is the goal.""  (Book: THE ACLU VS. AMERICA)  You may not have known this fact, but I'll bet you know who won the last American Idol competition.In one scene, we see McCarthy's Investigating Committee questioning the poor, old Black woman, ANNIE LEE MOSS, who was employed in the Pentagon's Code Room.  She denies ever having been a dues-paying Communist party member.  The Great Murrow makes a heroine of the poor beleaguered woman, insisting that it's a case of mistaken identity and irresponsible McCarthy charges.  What you WON'T learn in GN&GL; is that it was later proven using the Communist party's own records that THIS ""persecuted"" woman (who lived on R Street in Washington D.C.) had indeed been a dues-paying Communist.  Yes!  Watch GN&GL;, watch her lie, and watch Team Murrow defend her!The scene that nearly made me laugh out loud has Team Murrow fretting, anxiously awaiting with bated breath the morning edition of the New York Times to see whether or not their television attack on McCarthy the night before will meet with the approval of the ultraliberal but influential newspaper.  Yes, the stridently anti-McCarthy New York Times - THAT newspaper.  That's fairly analogous to tossing a bag of T-bone steaks into a kennel and then worrying that the dogs might resent it!But what of EDWARD R. MURROW?  Along with William Paley, he was a member of the COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS (CFR), an organization whose principal founder, Edward Mandell House, wrote that he essentially favored ""Socialism as dreamed of by Karl Marx.""  House further wrote, ""For a long time it had seemed to me that our government was too complicated in its machinery and that we had outgrown our Constitution.""  (Book: PHILIP DRU: ADMINISTRATOR)  According to 16-year CFR member, U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Chester Ward, the primary goal of the CFR is ""to bring about the surrender of the sovereignty and national independence of the United States ... to a one-world all-powerful global government.""  This will be global, totalitarian Socialism.  (Book: KISSINGER ON THE COUCH)  Today, the CFR even offers an ""Edward R. Murrow Fellowship Award"" and the Time-Warner company, distributor of GN&GL;, happens to be a CFR corporate member.What did MURROW do besides fight McCarthy's attempts to expose Socialists hidden in our government?  He defended J. Robert Oppenheimer who was fired as a security risk after it was shown that he had lied about his significant monetary donations to the Communist party.  MURROW produced a highly complimentary ""documentary"" on Fidel Castro which aided the Communist dictator in his coming to power in Cuba.  MURROW was an ardent defender of convicted Soviet agent Alger Hiss, and of Owen Lattimore, determined by the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee to have been ""a conscious articulate agent of the Soviet conspiracy.""  MURROW also was a board member of the Institute of International Education, which encouraged young American school teachers to train at the University of Moscow.  (Book: NONE DARE CALL IT TREASON: 25 YEARS LATER)  Of course, you Americonned citizens wouldn't know any of this because you've been busy watching C.S.I. Miami.Shakespeare's Juliet said, ""What's in a name?  That which we call a rose, by any other name, would smell as sweet.""  Well, if it looks like a pink rose, smells like a pink rose, and is growing amongst pink roses, I don't care if it's called a ""courageous newsman"" or a David who ""threw stones at giants"", I say it's a pink rose.  (And I gotta wonder if GN&GL;'s writer/director is planted in that same garden!)  I've seen raw meat less ""pink"" than Edward R. Murrow was.If you wish to wake up and throw off the shackles that have brainwashed you, go to the home page (titled, ""In The News"") of thenewamerican I-net site, click on the word ""Profiles"" (near the bottom of the left-hand column) and read ""The Real McCarthy Record"" by James J. Drummey.

Unable to sit idly by while Senator McCarthy publicly crucifies a soldier and his family for allegedly having shadowy connections to Communism, Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn), his producer Fred Friendly (George Clooney) and the rest of their CBS crew decide to take on McCarthy by questioning his motives and methods on air... You'd hope such a story wouldn't be so novel today. After all, the events the film narrates occurred fifty years ago. But with media increasingly controlled by large corporate interests, it's refreshing to see a film like Clooney's which shows what can happen when people have the balls to ask the questions everyone else is too terrified to ask. Beyond the thematic, this film is technically brilliant. The most impressive things about Clooney's writing and direction here are how efficient and thoughtful they are: the use of jazz from the next studio is not only historically accurate, but perfectly establishes the time, place and mood; the use of real footage, especially of McCarthy himself, is more powerful and more credible than any performance could have been. This isn't a long film. It isn't self-indulgent. It's short, quiet and contained. Given the subject matter it could so easily have been bombastic, didactic, even melodramatic. It isn't, and it doesn't need to be. Clooney grounds it in the personal lives and interactions of the news crew, making it less abstract and more human and thereby more moving. His case is perfectly clear: rather than trusting those who wrap themselves in the flag, stir up fear, and point the finger without evidence - things we've seen a lot of lately - we must demand such actions be defended and explained. Ultimately, Clooney's argument is about the power of television to be instrumental in doing just that.

641849,AYKM1B74OLEVC,B00005JOKM,Story Charts,"[0, 0]","Good Night and Good Luck uses two plots to try to prove the idea that civil liberties must be defended at all cost. One plot is a reporter's external quest to defeat Mccarthyism: the violation of civil liberties in the name of national security. This plot succeeds: Mccarthyism is defeated. The second plot is the external quest representing the reporter's career and well being. This plot ends in a failure. So the movie tries to demonstrate the idea that civil liberties must be defended at all cost by showing that the successful defense of civil liberties cost our heroes their jobs, careers, and even their lives.This idea is a timely one for us: today the world is captivated by the tales of Edward Snowden: an ex-CIA worker who has given up his career and possibly his life to reveal massive violations of the civil liberties of all Americans by their government. As of now, we don't know how this story ends. We don't know if the cost of his sacrifice was enough to earn a ""success"" of protecting our civil liberties. What we do know is that the US government, and much of the public, believe that it is necessary to give up certain civil liberties in the name of national security. What this movie tries to demonstrate is that the US Constitution is built upon the idea that basic freedoms cannot be compromised at all, and that they must be defended to the death. As our hero says:""We can deny our heritage and our history but we cannot escape responsibility for the result. We proclaim ourselves as indeed we are, the defenders of freedom wherever it continues to exist in the world. But we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home. The actions of the Junior Senator from Wisconsin have caused alarm and dismay amongst our allies abroad and given considerable comfort to our enemies. And whose fault is that? Not really his, he didn't create this situation of fear, he merely exploited it, and rather successfully. Cassius was right, the fault dear Brutus is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Good night, and good luck.""So the movie picked a very important idea to prove. Unfortunately, it doesn't do a very good job of proving it.The plot depicting the cost of our heroes is bland. There are no uplifting turning points on this plot. The heroes lose money, security, their jobs, the lives and their careers in a steady drumbeat of bad news. Because there are no twists and turns along the ride of this plot, the costs seem episodic and didactic. This makes the heroes seem flat and unreasonably ""good"" as they continue their march against the villains irregardless of casualties and consequence. Basically there aren't enough twists here to keep the story interesting. None of the heroes undergo internal arcs (they are all conscientious from start to end) and none of them undergo relationship arcs (they are all in it together from beginning to end, even a married couple who were forced to split up).This make the film seem didactic: it is a series of self righteous speeches by our heroes against the villains and we are asked to watch the movie with the hindsight of history to see their actions in the proper moral light.Ironically, the Snowden story playing out today has more interesting twists and drama than Good Night and Good Luck:- we don't yet know if Snowden will be successful in convincing the American people to defend their own freedoms.- Snowden has obviously acknowledged and accepted the costs to his career and possibly his life.- Snowden's internal ideals are tested enormously now: he has ironically sought political asylum from countries that have horrendous human rights track records as compared to the USA. This has already compromised his public reputation and may affect the outcome of his external quest as he could become an international political pawn.President Obama has even acknowledged in a condescending manner that the Snowden story might make a ""TV movie"" someday as he tries to convince the American people that civil liberties must be ""balanced"" with national security. Depending on how Snowden's internal struggles and his external quest turn out, his story just might prove the idea that civil liberties cannot be compromised at all and must be defended to the death.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca",3,Civil liberties must be defended at all cost,1374364800,"07 21, 2013",2013,4287,"['Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'two', 'plots', 'try', 'prove', 'idea', 'civil', 'liberties', 'must', 'be', 'defended', 'cost', 'One', 'plot', 'reporter', 'external', 'quest', 'defeat', 'Mccarthyism', 'violation', 'civil', 'liberties', 'name', 'national', 'security', 'plot', 'Mccarthyism', 'defeated', 'second', 'plot', 'external', 'quest', 'representing', 'reporter', 'career', 'well', 'being', 'plot', 'failure', 'movie', 'demonstrate', 'idea', 'civil', 'liberties', 'must', 'be', 'defended', 'cost', 'showing', 'successful', 'defense', 'civil', 'liberties', 'cost', 'heroes', 'jobs', 'careers', 'even', 'lives.This', 'idea', 'timely', 'one', 'today', 'world', 'captivated', 'tales', 'Edward', 'Snowden', 'ex-CIA', 'worker', 'who', 'given', 'up', 'career', 'possibly', 'life', 'reveal', 'massive', 'violations', 'civil', 'liberties', 'Americans', 'government', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'cost', 'sacrifice', 'was', 'enough', 'earn', 'success', 'protecting', 'civil', 'liberties', 'What', 'do', 'know', 'US', 'government', 'much', 'public', 'believe', 'necessary', 'give', 'up', 'certain', 'civil', 'liberties', 'name', 'national', 'security', 'What', 'movie', 'demonstrate', 'US', 'Constitution', 'built', 'idea', 'basic', 'freedoms', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'compromised', 'must', 'be', 'defended', 'death', 'hero', 'can', 'deny', 'heritage', 'history', 'can', 'not', 'escape', 'responsibility', 'result', 'proclaim', 'indeed', 'are', 'defenders', 'freedom', 'exist', 'world', 'can', 'not', 'defend', 'freedom', 'abroad', 'deserting', 'home', 'actions', 'Junior', 'Senator', 'Wisconsin', 'have', 'caused', 'alarm', 'dismay', 'amongst', 'allies', 'abroad', 'given', 'considerable', 'comfort', 'enemies', 'fault', 'Not', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'create', 'situation', 'fear', 'merely', 'exploited', 'rather', 'successfully', 'Cassius', 'was', 'right', 'fault', 'dear', 'Brutus', 'not', 'stars', 'Good', 'night', 'good', 'luck', 'movie', 'picked', 'very', 'important', 'idea', 'prove', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'do', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'proving', 'it.The', 'plot', 'depicting', 'cost', 'heroes', 'bland', 'are', 'uplifting', 'turning', 'points', 'plot', 'heroes', 'lose', 'money', 'security', 'jobs', 'lives', 'careers', 'steady', 'drumbeat', 'bad', 'news', 'are', 'twists', 'along', 'ride', 'plot', 'costs', 'seem', 'episodic', 'didactic', 'heroes', 'seem', 'flat', 'unreasonably', 'good', 'continue', 'march', 'villains', 'irregardless', 'casualties', 'consequence', 'Basically', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'twists', 'here', 'keep', 'story', 'interesting', 'None', 'heroes', 'undergo', 'internal', 'arcs', 'are', 'conscientious', 'start', 'end', 'none', 'undergo', 'relationship', 'arcs', 'are', 'together', 'beginning', 'end', 'even', 'married', 'couple', 'who', 'were', 'forced', 'split', 'up', 'make', 'film', 'seem', 'didactic', 'series', 'self', 'righteous', 'speeches', 'heroes', 'villains', 'are', 'asked', 'watch', 'movie', 'hindsight', 'history', 'see', 'actions', 'proper', 'moral', 'light.Ironically', 'Snowden', 'story', 'playing', 'out', 'today', 'more', 'interesting', 'twists', 'drama', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'do', ""n't"", 'yet', 'know', 'Snowden', 'will', 'be', 'successful', 'convincing', 'American', 'people', 'defend', 'own', 'freedoms.-', 'Snowden', 'obviously', 'acknowledged', 'accepted', 'costs', 'career', 'possibly', 'life.-', 'Snowden', 'internal', 'ideals', 'are', 'tested', 'enormously', 'now', 'ironically', 'sought', 'political', 'asylum', 'countries', 'have', 'horrendous', 'human', 'rights', 'track', 'records', 'compared', 'USA', 'already', 'compromised', 'public', 'reputation', 'may', 'affect', 'outcome', 'external', 'quest', 'could', 'become', 'international', 'political', 'pawn.President', 'Obama', 'even', 'acknowledged', 'condescending', 'manner', 'Snowden', 'story', 'might', 'make', 'TV', 'movie', 'someday', 'convince', 'American', 'people', 'civil', 'liberties', 'must', 'be', 'balanced', 'national', 'security', 'Depending', 'how', 'Snowden', 'internal', 'struggles', 'external', 'quest', 'turn', 'out', 'story', 'just', 'might', 'prove', 'idea', 'civil', 'liberties', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'compromised', 'must', 'be', 'defended', 'death.My', 'Story', 'Chart', 'movie', 'storycharts.ca']",N/A

Yes, indeed, character assassination is bad, and witch hunts are bad, and McCarthy serves as a well-known and convenient target for that message.The black and white style is very effective, and it was a perfect move having footage of McCarthy himself rather than a stand-in. And one can't help but notice the ever-present cigarettes. No wonder Murrow died of lung cancer.My problem is that not much happens, even when padded with the unnecessary scenes with the jazz singer (very pleasant, of course, but adding nothing to the story) and the couple married despite the rules at CBS (a little note on the life and times in the early days at CBS, but so what?). I would have been more interested in how the news room actually operated. Is  it true that hardly anybody there actually reported, and that, even then, they were basically news readers gathering up information from the real workforce? Why didn't Murrow get out and interview some of the protagonists? Or the ones under attack? At least for the guy cut from the military, a unit was sent out for some footage. Did CBS really takes its lead on story ideas from the print media?I wouldn't expect the movie to be completely impartial, such as getting beyond the throwaway remark about Alger Hiss or mentioning someone who might actually have been doing subversive activities. That wasn't its point, and I don't really care. I think viewers of the movie can and do expect Clooney's spin on the subject, along with the self-congratulatory tone, almost as if the movie makers themselves were somehow sticking their necks out.

In the early 1950s, Wisconsin, a state famous for two reasons only, dairy products and the Green Bay Packers, acquired a dubious third, a junior Senator called Joseph McCarthy, who sought to make a name for himself by finding Reds under nearly every bed. It was an era when people could lose jobs because they were risks to national security, based on evidence they weren't allowed to see and when the media were relatively subdued for fear of being labelled as ""unpatriotic"" or even ""treasonous"". Sound familiar?The story is of the confrontation between McCarthy and the distinguished CBS newsman Ed Murrow, famous for his broadcasts from London during the Blitz (""Goodnight, and good luck"" was his London sign-off - after all, nobody knew whether there was a Luftwaffe bomb with your name on it - which he kept). On his CBS news show, Murrow calmly and methodically exposed McCarthy for the humbug that he was, and when McCarthy tried to smear him, equally calmly and methodically took him apart. It was the end of the road for McCarthyism (although the whole travesty of un-American activities, blacklisted Hollywood writers, etc., was to continue for some years).The film is in black and white and features director George Clooney in a secondary role. Murrow is played by David Strathairn, who looks passably like Murrow, and he does a splendid job as the determined journalist. No actor plays McCarthy, he being played by himself, on old TV recordings. Another good role is CBS's long-suffering boss, forever on the verge of becoming a nervous wreck because of the fear of Murrow's crusading scaring away the sponsors. In the end, he tells Murrow that his type of reporting is no longer required and changes the nature of his show.Which brings us to the beginning and the end of the film. The story is bookended by a speech that Murrow gave to a radio and TV association meeting, which was a litany of complaint of how television, a powerful force for enlightenment, was becoming a trivial medium, lacking serious meaning and squandering its potential.

641859,A2CCMDEZSWKMGQ,B00005JOKM,The Judge of the Value of all Entertainment & Art,"[3, 8]","""Good Night and Good Luck"" is an entertaining 90-minute movie that, in a fitting congruence with its black-and-white color scheme, is presented as a battle between the noble newsmen of CBS and the evil Senator who is trying to destroy the American way of life. Overall, I like it.Yes, it is certainly possible to have an objection to the over-simplified portrayal of the situation in the 1950s. Was McCarthy wrong? Of course he was. This isn't even debatable. However, perhaps the climate of fear of Communism could have been captured better. Maybe the film could have induced the kind of emotions that many Americans were feeling at the time that allowed so many to capitulate to the man's shameful agenda.That said, just because a movie is about a serious issue does not mean it has to be an even-handed debate, especially in an age where dissenters once again might feel like they are not getting a fair shake.  It should certainly be a good feeling for anyone who has been called un-American in recent years for oppostion to the secretive and repressive policies of the current administration to be able to have a rush of patriotism at the actions of this heroic broadcaster who is engaging in the most American activity of all: free speech.For the most part, it is a fun and easy ride as we revile the political and economic forces in Murrow's way, laugh at the shallow celebrity interviews he has to endure, and cheer his courage in the face of impossible odds until he finally triumphs and his tyrannical nemisis is tarred and feathered for his evil deeds.The only part of this movie that seems like total dead-weight is the subplot in which a married couple at CBS has to hide their relationship because it is against company policy. Is this supposed to be a parallel to the situation that suspected communists found themselves in? Not only does it seem completely out of place, but is boring even when taken on its own merits.The movie is very fast-paced, dropping the viewer in after about five seconds of title cards barely explaining its historical context. From there, it is expected that the audience is going to be able to follow the lightning-fast decision making and news broadcasts because it is familiar with the era. Since most people probably know something about the Red Scare and have made up their minds about McCarthy, this is not much of a drawback, and in fact it may be relieving not to have to sit through a miniature history lesson.However, the story also skips over a few things. McCarthy was wrong in his approach and wrong to abridge the rights of his fellow Americans. He was certainly wrong to label such Patriotic groups as the ACLU as arms of the Communists. But America was engaged in a war with a frightening enemy, and there were, in fact, Communists infiltrating the government. The very fact that this was the case, that there was some merit to the fear McCarthy was using to squash Americans' freedom-loving instincts, is what seduced so many into falling in line with him. It is also what neccessitated that anyone standing up to him have real and substantial courage. And the need for that kind of courage in the face of real, oppressive fear is a lesson that still resonates today.That said, it is not George Clooney's responsibility to have a nuanced political discussion. He has every right to decide to make a movie whose purpose is to help the audience feel good. And the reason for the overwhelmingly positive critical response to this film is that he offers a welcome respite for the tired American who has been told for too long that he does not belong unless he willingly collapses under the weight of the fear of today.",4,A Rah-Rah Movie For Dissenters,1129248000,"10 14, 2005",2005,3674,"['Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'entertaining', '90-minute', 'movie', 'fitting', 'congruence', 'black-and-white', 'color', 'scheme', 'presented', 'battle', 'noble', 'newsmen', 'CBS', 'evil', 'Senator', 'who', 'trying', 'destroy', 'American', 'way', 'life', 'Overall', 'like', 'it.Yes', 'certainly', 'possible', 'have', 'objection', 'over-simplified', 'portrayal', 'situation', '1950s', 'Was', 'McCarthy', 'wrong', 'course', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'debatable', 'However', 'perhaps', 'climate', 'fear', 'Communism', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'captured', 'better', 'Maybe', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'induced', 'kind', 'emotions', 'many', 'Americans', 'were', 'feeling', 'time', 'allowed', 'so', 'many', 'capitulate', 'man', 'shameful', 'agenda.That', 'said', 'just', 'movie', 'serious', 'issue', 'not', 'mean', 'be', 'even-handed', 'debate', 'especially', 'age', 'where', 'dissenters', 'once', 'again', 'might', 'feel', 'are', 'not', 'getting', 'fair', 'shake', 'should', 'certainly', 'be', 'good', 'feeling', 'anyone', 'who', 'been', 'called', 'un-American', 'recent', 'years', 'oppostion', 'secretive', 'repressive', 'policies', 'current', 'administration', 'be', 'able', 'have', 'rush', 'patriotism', 'actions', 'heroic', 'broadcaster', 'who', 'engaging', 'most', 'American', 'activity', 'free', 'speech.For', 'most', 'part', 'fun', 'easy', 'ride', 'revile', 'political', 'economic', 'forces', 'Murrow', 'way', 'laugh', 'shallow', 'celebrity', 'interviews', 'endure', 'cheer', 'courage', 'face', 'impossible', 'odds', 'finally', 'triumphs', 'tyrannical', 'nemisis', 'tarred', 'feathered', 'evil', 'deeds.The', 'only', 'part', 'movie', 'total', 'dead-weight', 'subplot', 'married', 'couple', 'CBS', 'hide', 'relationship', 'company', 'policy', 'supposed', 'be', 'parallel', 'situation', 'suspected', 'communists', 'found', 'Not', 'only', 'seem', 'completely', 'place', 'boring', 'even', 'when', 'taken', 'own', 'merits.The', 'movie', 'very', 'fast-paced', 'dropping', 'viewer', 'five', 'seconds', 'title', 'cards', 'barely', 'explaining', 'historical', 'context', 'there', 'expected', 'audience', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'follow', 'lightning-fast', 'decision', 'making', 'news', 'broadcasts', 'familiar', 'era', 'most', 'people', 'probably', 'know', 'something', 'Red', 'Scare', 'have', 'made', 'up', 'minds', 'McCarthy', 'not', 'much', 'drawback', 'fact', 'may', 'be', 'relieving', 'not', 'have', 'sit', 'miniature', 'history', 'lesson.However', 'story', 'also', 'few', 'things', 'McCarthy', 'was', 'wrong', 'approach', 'wrong', 'abridge', 'rights', 'fellow', 'Americans', 'was', 'certainly', 'wrong', 'label', 'such', 'Patriotic', 'groups', 'ACLU', 'arms', 'Communists', 'America', 'was', 'engaged', 'war', 'frightening', 'enemy', 'were', 'fact', 'Communists', 'infiltrating', 'government', 'very', 'fact', 'was', 'case', 'was', 'merit', 'fear', 'McCarthy', 'was', 'using', 'squash', 'Americans', 'freedom-loving', 'instincts', 'what', 'seduced', 'so', 'many', 'falling', 'line', 'also', 'what', 'neccessitated', 'anyone', 'standing', 'up', 'have', 'real', 'substantial', 'courage', 'need', 'kind', 'courage', 'face', 'real', 'oppressive', 'fear', 'lesson', 'still', 'today.That', 'said', 'not', 'George', 'Clooney', 'responsibility', 'have', 'nuanced', 'political', 'discussion', 'right', 'decide', 'make', 'movie', 'purpose', 'help', 'audience', 'feel', 'good', 'reason', 'overwhelmingly', 'positive', 'critical', 'response', 'film', 'welcome', 'respite', 'tired', 'American', 'who', 'been', 'told', 'too', 'long', 'not', 'belong', 'willingly', 'weight', 'fear', 'today']",N/A

Murrow, a CBS newscaster, who took on a senator by the name of Joseph McCarthy back in the mid 1950's by verbally attacking him on his newscast.Joseph McCarthy had been attacking hundreds of people for being [allegedly] part of the communist party. Back then America itself was under paranoid fear that the communist party would overthrow the American government, and Edward R. Murrow was one of the few newscasters to stand up to McCarthy.Directed by George Clooney, who also stars and won an oscar for his best supporting actor role, Good Night and Good Luck is entirely in black and white, a great touch to make it look even more authentic that the audience has been taken back to 1954. Murrow is portrayed by David Strathairn, and is the sole purpose why you should see this movie. [My opinion]Murrow always went on his TV show and made a speech near the end to show what he felt about topics such as McCarthyism and others and became famous for attacking McCarthy. Not many newscasters would attack McCarthy for fear that they themselves would be attacked as well, but that did not stop Murrow. Strathairn did a great job acting and deserved a spot in being nominated for best actor.The movie is also great seeing real footage of McCarthy hearings and seeing real people back then who were accused of communism argue for their innocence. The characters play off the real footage really well and they also show real developement as the show nears cancellation because of Murrow's attacks on McCarhty.There are some scenes that might stretch a little too long for some people, but that depends on who watches the movie. However Murrow's performance and his speeches he gives several times in the movies makes you want to see more, and that is what really highlights this movie.It really is something to see when Murrow is talking. I could go on about how greatly detailed this movie is, but you need to see this for yourself.

The audience is presumed to understand the overall context of the movie and in general the McCarthy hysteria that was in place as the movie begins. The movie is filmed in black and white (a bit too bright and sharp) in order to use original clips of Mr McCarthy and the hearings within the context of the movie. The story encompasses Mr Murrow and Mr Friendly and their staff, their decision to expose Mr McCarthy and the effect that it had on their lives, the lifes of those around them and on the network. It is almost trite to add that the movie is also a commentary on current political events, as well as an out-and-out denoument of current television fare.The movie is shot in a lot of tight close-ups and is mostly dialog.

641863,A3CW4EZUTEV0VC,B00005JOKM,The Rocketman,"[2, 4]","GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK is a dramatization of a very brief period of time (about 2 months) when Edward R. Murrow's news team decided to do a news story on Joe McCarthy as a means of showing the true rhetorical and baiting tactics of the Senator.  This story is framed by a speech that Murrow gave in 1958 to the Radio and Television News Directors Association (RTNDA) where he prophetically warns against TV news becoming simply entertainment, doing more harm than good.The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous - made all the beautiful by the fact that everyone in the 1950's seemed to chain smoke.The acting is superb and in some ways mirrors some of the newsroom scenes in ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN.  Don't expect lots of action in this movie, but do expect to be entertained.  The movie does an excellent job of not falling into the trap of presenting Murrow as a saint - he is very real here.  We see, for example, that he isn't a crusader by nature (when he refuses to go after a colleague's red-baiting newspaper commentator) and that he finds his celebrity interviews as a tedious, but necessary, exercise to work on the stories he finds important.  Murrow comes off as a pragmatist and very shrewd - right down to criticizing his colleagues at the RTNDA dinner.  McCarthy is similarly treated fairly objectively - especially since he appears as himself in old footage.The film does a clever job of using this existing footage to provide a real sense of reality as Murrow does his interviews remotely anyway.  There is a particularly entertaining exchange with Liberace who carefully hides his gay nature when asked about finding a partner in the future.  It accurately reflects just how much TV in the 50's was restrained and how many topics were utterly taboo.The story is so tightly focused on the single Murrow/McCarthy exchange that it is quite short and hence it is padded out with jazz interludes (which comment on the action in the story) and a subplot involving a couple that can't risk exposing their marriage lest they be fired by CBS.  It would have been nice to have this subplot more integrated into the storyline.  While the prime story is exquisite as told, there was definitely available time for additional background that would have been helpful for anyone not already knowing the sequence of events.  For example, the world of America in the 50's isn't really developed outside of the newsroom.  Even in the newsroom, there is little feel for how primitive the technology was, how this was truly a media in its infancy.There are two extras which this DVD unfortunately doesn't have:  the actual broadcasts that Murrow did and McCarthy's reply.  Perhaps Clooney didn't want to invite comparisons - or perhaps he wanted this to be a cinematic rather than a documentary experience.For those of you that enjoyed this movie, you should check out (a) the biopic on Roy Cohn (CITIZEN COHN), which has an extraordinary performance of James Woods as the title character - who was Joe McCarthy's right-hand man, and, (b) most especially, the superb documentary POINT OF ORDER which is a phenomenal condensation of the live footage of the Army-McCarthy Hearings, where McCarthy really did destroy himself on television.",5,Black and White movie -- with shades of gray,1143936000,"04 2, 2006",2006,3235,"['GOOD', 'NIGHT', 'AND', 'GOOD', 'LUCK', 'dramatization', 'very', 'brief', 'period', 'time', '2', 'months', 'when', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'news', 'team', 'decided', 'do', 'news', 'story', 'Joe', 'McCarthy', 'means', 'showing', 'true', 'rhetorical', 'baiting', 'tactics', 'Senator', 'story', 'framed', 'speech', 'Murrow', 'gave', '1958', 'Radio', 'Television', 'News', 'Directors', 'Association', 'RTNDA', 'where', 'prophetically', 'TV', 'news', 'becoming', 'simply', 'entertainment', 'doing', 'more', 'harm', 'good.The', 'cinematography', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'made', 'beautiful', 'fact', 'everyone', '1950', 'seemed', 'chain', 'smoke.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'ways', 'mirrors', 'newsroom', 'scenes', 'THE', 'PRESIDENT', 'MEN', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'lots', 'action', 'movie', 'do', 'expect', 'be', 'entertained', 'movie', 'excellent', 'job', 'not', 'falling', 'trap', 'presenting', 'Murrow', 'saint', 'very', 'real', 'here', 'see', 'example', ""n't"", 'crusader', 'nature', 'when', 'go', 'colleague', 'red-baiting', 'newspaper', 'commentator', 'celebrity', 'interviews', 'tedious', 'necessary', 'exercise', 'work', 'stories', 'important', 'Murrow', 'off', 'pragmatist', 'very', 'shrewd', 'right', 'criticizing', 'colleagues', 'RTNDA', 'dinner', 'McCarthy', 'similarly', 'treated', 'fairly', 'objectively', 'especially', 'old', 'footage.The', 'film', 'clever', 'job', 'using', 'existing', 'footage', 'provide', 'real', 'sense', 'reality', 'Murrow', 'interviews', 'remotely', 'anyway', 'particularly', 'entertaining', 'exchange', 'Liberace', 'who', 'carefully', 'gay', 'nature', 'when', 'asked', 'finding', 'partner', 'future', 'accurately', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'TV', '50', 'was', 'restrained', 'how', 'many', 'topics', 'were', 'utterly', 'taboo.The', 'story', 'so', 'tightly', 'focused', 'single', 'Murrow/McCarthy', 'exchange', 'quite', 'short', 'hence', 'padded', 'out', 'jazz', 'interludes', 'comment', 'action', 'story', 'subplot', 'involving', 'couple', 'ca', ""n't"", 'risk', 'exposing', 'marriage', 'lest', 'be', 'fired', 'CBS', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'subplot', 'more', 'integrated', 'storyline', 'prime', 'story', 'exquisite', 'told', 'was', 'definitely', 'available', 'time', 'additional', 'background', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'helpful', 'anyone', 'not', 'already', 'knowing', 'sequence', 'events', 'example', 'world', 'America', '50', ""n't"", 'really', 'developed', 'newsroom', 'Even', 'newsroom', 'little', 'feel', 'how', 'primitive', 'technology', 'was', 'how', 'was', 'truly', 'media', 'are', 'two', 'extras', 'DVD', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'have', 'actual', 'broadcasts', 'Murrow', 'did', 'McCarthy', 'reply', 'Perhaps', 'Clooney', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'invite', 'comparisons', 'perhaps', 'wanted', 'be', 'cinematic', 'rather', 'documentary', 'experience.For', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'biopic', 'Roy', 'Cohn', 'CITIZEN', 'COHN', 'extraordinary', 'performance', 'James', 'Woods', 'title', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'Joe', 'McCarthy', 'right-hand', 'man', 'b', 'most', 'especially', 'superb', 'documentary', 'POINT', 'OF', 'ORDER', 'phenomenal', 'condensation', 'live', 'footage', 'Army-McCarthy', 'Hearings', 'where', 'McCarthy', 'really', 'did', 'destroy', 'television']",N/A
641864,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JOKM,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[8, 13]","There is a reason why Edward R. Murrow is so revered by journalists the world over.In ""Good Night, and Good Luck"", George Clooney explores perhaps the most politically volatile period in the newsman's career. In the early 50s, Murrow (David Strathairn, in a great performance) went after Senator Joe McCarthy, devoting a number of his broadcasts to exposing the activities of the ""Junior Senator from Wisconsin"", the man behind HUAC, the House Un-American Activities Committee.If you know anything about this period in history, it is probably that a number of people in the entertainment community were called to testify before the committee. If they testified, they continued to work. If they didn't, they were blacklisted. Many of the biggest stars didn't testify and continued to work; if the studios blacklisted them, their revenues would have dropped. The period of the ""Blacklist"" is perhaps one of the most reprehensible periods in the history of our country.What many probably don't realize is that McCarthy started with regular people. Initially, he went after people like a middle-aged black woman who worked in the codes department of the FBI. She worked for a number of decades in the dining room of the large government agency, then received a promotion. Because there may have been a vague link to a ""communist"" publication many years earlier, she was brought before the committee and lost her job. Another of McCarthy's early targets was Milo Radulovich, a Greek-American who joined the Air Force. McCarthy learned that his father and sister may have been communist supporters and insisted that Radulovich denounce them. When he wouldn't, he was kicked out of the Air Force. The film also reminds us that people like McCarthy viewed the ACLU as a communist organization.Murrow and his producer, Fred Friendly (Clooney), decide to report the story of Milo Radulovich during one of their broadcasts. Naturally, the government is none too pleased, concerned about the security of the Air Force. McCarthy later takes them up on their offer to address the topic. Using his opportunity on Murrow's broadcast, McCarthy denounces the newsman's accusations. Sound familiar?If for no other reason, ""Goodnight"" should make you mad because we are watching a JOURNALIST at work. Murrow used his broadcasts to report issues and explore them, in depth, for 30 minutes. What a difference from the claptrap we experience today as ""television news"". The local news programs spend more time running stories about cute pets (from other cities) and trying to fit world issues and crises into a sixty second window than actually reporting the news. How can anyone learn all of the complexities of any national or world issue in 60 seconds? This is one of the reasons I listen to NPR on a daily basis. ""Goodnight"" is a portrait of a man at the height of his powers, trying to inform the public about a terrible wrong.Murrow, Friendly and their team broadcast an interview with Radulovich and then broadcast the HUAC Committee hearings about the woman who worked in the code office. Both events draw the ire of the government and McCarthy, costing Murrow his sponsor. Murrow and Friendly agree to pay for the commercials that won't air because they believe in the story so much. Bill Paley (Frank Langella), the head of CBS, supports them, to an extent, giving them the leeway to run the stories they want to run, as long as they are accurate. But when the sponsors start to pull the ads, Paley became more watchful of the newsman. Paley uses this as leverage to get Murrow to interview a series of celebrities, in exchange for giving him the go ahead to run the more hard hitting stories. Even then, the networks realized the economics of fluff. It is interesting to watch Murrow interview Liberace, from his home, about his marriage plans. Liberace states that he is going to wait for the ""right partner"" to come along before taking the plunge.David Strathairn does a great job of portraying Morrow. What I think makes the performance so indelible is that every time we see Morrow, we see the fear he is living with; the fear that McCarthy will continue with his witch-hunt and how it might change America, the fear that his voice will be silenced by a network that needs revenue to stay afloat, the fear that the public will not want to hear his voice. Strathairn portrays Murrow as a strong man, the head of a gang of reporters who are devoted to him, and he must remain strong in their presence. Yet, the fear comes through making his character seem all the more real.Clooney does a good job as Friendly, Murrow's devoted producer. It is a smaller role and provides less impact than Strathairn's performance, but it does provide a great amount of insight into the support team behind Murrow.Langella is also very good as Paley. For his few moments of screen time, he manages to portray the complexity of a man with morals running a large broadcast network. He wants to support Murrow, but he also has hundreds of employees to think of. Any decision he makes will affect the lives of all of those people.Clooney, the director, is less interested in making all of the other people in the team stand out. It is difficult to tell who the other people are, or what their function in the team is. Robert Downey, Jr., Tate Donovan, Reed Diamond and Patricia Clarkson are members of Murrow's team, yet we only get a vague idea of who they are and what they do. Downey, Jr. and Clarkson are married, yet hiding the marriage from the rest of the team. I must have missed the reason behind this. For any other film, this would be a more compelling criticism. In the case of ""Goodnight"", the film is, ostensibly, about Murrow and therefore should focus on him. It seems less important that the other characters are mere shadows. Clearly, the talent involved wanted to help bring this story to life and didn't care about the size of the role.Clooney does a fantastic job of recreating the time and space of the CBS Network offices in the early 50s. The film, shot in black and white, has a slightly grainy look, coupled with the constant cigarette smoke swirling throughout the air, gives everything the look of an old television newscast. All of the sets are drenched in shades of black and white, further adding to the period feel. The look really reminded me of one of Woody Allen's good black and white films, like ""Broadway Danny Rose"". The look is created with such skill that it really enhances the film.""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is a film recreating a specific event. It delves, almost minutely, into the detail of this event giving the viewer a great, uncompromising look at an important moment in our history.",4,Clooney Brings the Celebrated Newsman to

641865,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B00005JOKM,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[3, 5]","In an amazingly poignant allegory to our modern world, George Clooney has made a movie the old fashioned way: tell a story with moral point of view without making you gag from the plunger being rammed down your throat. ""Good Night And Good Luck"" spools out like a stage play, in sharp contrasting Black and White, with the feel of a documentary. As I am sure most already know, the Murrow V. McCarthy battle that played out live in the 50's Televisions essentially put a chink in the stampeding MaCarthy witch hunts before McCarthy's own hubris (and closet-case denial issues) finally crashed him for good.But when David Strathairn intones that he can no longer allow a two-sided argument to take place when the opposite side is so obviously evil, it makes you cringe at the current state of political journalism. Frankly, Strathairn is so good and completely absorbed in his role as William Murrow that you could almost allow yourself to believe you're viewing a documentary, and the B&W; camera work plays right into that illusion. When listening to Strathairn so eloquently offer his discourses on American Government (often direct transcripts of Murrow's own reports), it all but broke my heart that broadcasting has lost its brains and guts. To hear these loquacious men deliver the news with intelligence and an expectation that people would WANT to know (as opposed to the current state of newsbite-dumbed-down-don't-offend-no-word-greater-than-two-syllables-and-celebrity-movie-hype-clip-after-this-commercial swill that passes for cowardly journalism these days) and a desire to have it expressed without collapsing before the Lowest Common Denominator.As a former broadcaster, seeing the aftermath as William Paley basically sells everyone involved with ""See It Now"" down the river for game shows was gut-wrenching. But for a reminder that a good man can still do great things, George Clooney's firm handed ""Good Night And Good Luck"" will give you hope that movies and broadcasting could one day reclaim a moral ground and a national responsibility when the next necessary ""protective war"" comes along.",4,"""He didn't create the situation of fear, he merely exploited it...""",1143763200,"03 31, 2006",2006,2112,"['amazingly', 'poignant', 'allegory', 'modern', 'world', 'George', 'Clooney', 'made', 'movie', 'old', 'fashioned', 'way', 'tell', 'story', 'moral', 'point', 'view', 'making', 'gag', 'plunger', 'being', 'rammed', 'throat', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'out', 'stage', 'play', 'sharp', 'contrasting', 'Black', 'White', 'feel', 'documentary', 'am', 'sure', 'most', 'already', 'know', 'Murrow', 'V.', 'McCarthy', 'battle', 'played', 'out', 'live', '50', 'Televisions', 'essentially', 'put', 'chink', 'stampeding', 'MaCarthy', 'witch', 'hunts', 'McCarthy', 'own', 'hubris', 'closet-case', 'denial', 'issues', 'finally', 'crashed', 'good.But', 'when', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'allow', 'two-sided', 'argument', 'take', 'place', 'when', 'opposite', 'side', 'so', 'obviously', 'evil', 'cringe', 'current', 'state', 'political', 'journalism', 'Frankly', 'Strathairn', 'so', 'good', 'completely', 'absorbed', 'role', 'William', 'Murrow', 'could', 'almost', 'allow', 'believe', ""'re"", 'viewing', 'documentary', 'B', 'W', 'camera', 'work', 'plays', 'right', 'illusion', 'When', 'listening', 'Strathairn', 'so', 'eloquently', 'offer', 'discourses', 'American', 'Government', 'often', 'direct', 'transcripts', 'Murrow', 'own', 'reports', 'broke', 'heart', 'broadcasting', 'lost', 'brains', 'guts', 'hear', 'loquacious', 'men', 'deliver', 'news', 'intelligence', 'expectation', 'people', 'would', 'WANT', 'know', 'opposed', 'current', 'state', ""newsbite-dumbed-down-don't-offend-no-word-greater-than-two-syllables-and-celebrity-movie-hype-clip-after-this-commercial"", 'swill', 'cowardly', 'journalism', 'days', 'desire', 'have', 'expressed', 'collapsing', 'Lowest', 'Common', 'Denominator.As', 'former', 'broadcaster', 'seeing', 'aftermath', 'William', 'Paley', 'basically', 'everyone', 'involved', 'See', 'Now', 'river', 'game', 'shows', 'was', 'gut-wrenching', 'reminder', 'good', 'man', 'can', 'still', 'do', 'great', 'things', 'George', 'Clooney', 'firm', 'handed', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'will', 'give', 'hope', 'movies', 'broadcasting', 'could', 'one', 'day', 'reclaim', 'moral', 'ground', 'national', 'responsibility', 'when', 'next', 'necessary', 'protective', 'war', 'along']",N/A

Showing footage of McCarthy with the actors was a good choice. The Edward R. Murrow actor is a great imitator. I like most of the acting and there's a certain elegance to the way people smoke. But this movie is about a battle that's been fought and won with only the Ann Coulters of the world acting like the winners were on the wrong side. It was a scary time, I suppose, but it's over.Watching these people go through the motions of fighting the battle is about as exciting as watching a baseball game where you already know the outcome and the plays (although I find baseball boring either way).

641867,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B00005JOKM,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[1, 7]","A colleague of mine who, incidentally, is the only person I know on earth who admires Joe McCarthy, dreaded the release of this film. So I was incited to see it.In addition, in 1976, I was reading a book either by or about Murrow in which I learned for the first time that, as is stated in the film script, Joe McCarthy didn't create the anti-commie hysteria, he just ""exploited"" it.Next, I know some elderly activists who were accused of being in the Communist Party during the McCarthy era. The subject came up after the release of a Robert DeNiro film about that era at least a decade ago. Those activists left the DeNiro film in tears, recalling the fear that overwhelmed them in the early 1950s.Anyway, this film is well timed. We have an administration who, not unlike McCarthy, tries to accuse critics of treason, or crimes approaching treason. There are also books and documents that are doing their best to free McCarthy of the reputation that has infected him since his death: an oppressive opportunist who cared little about the effects of his accusations on those he accused. Revisionist indeed.But also a theme that pervades the film is the low quality of television in general. The story starts in 1958, after the McCarthy business, at a gathering of television journalists (if I recall correctly). It reverts to early in the 1950s through Murrow's challenges of McCarthy and all that entailed, then ends in 1958 again with Murrow--played in Oscar-quality by David Strathairn--suggesting that if we're not conscientious, the television will (as it has!) become a pretty useless box of wires.In the meantime, while CBS chief Bill Paley stood by Murrow, he was far more concerned with the bottom line. Murrow had the guts to challenge McCarthy. McCarthy retorted with more lies, allegations of Murrow, for example, having been a member of the IWW. (Indeed, if you read critiques of Tail Gunner Joe, that was his most effective tool: to aim allegations at anyone with such rapidity and absurdity that it was hard to respond that they were still MORE lies. Well, Murrow did so. In the meantime, one--probably more in real life--of Murrow's colleagues, Don Hollenbeck, played mastersfully in Oscar-winning quality by Ray Wise, who'd been accused of affiliation with the commies committed suicide. (Just from the looks on his face, you knew from the beginning what would eventually happen!)After several episodes of Murrow's show, Paley decided that ratings indicated that the show should be moved to a time on the schedule where no one would watch it. After all, there was a quiz show people would be more inclined to watch and increase advertising revenue.Then, history shows more than the film, McCarthy accused the Army of being commie infiltrated, and he started falling.It's important that this film be seen, to reminisce that repressive period that was McCarthyism and to counter the revisionism that makes it look like that period--and its later manifestations--was justifiable.By the way, I have a relative buried in the same cemetery in which McCarthy is fertilizer. After the relative's funeral, someone asked my grandfather if he's like to check out the McCarthy grave. He responded, ""I didn't like the SOB when he was alive.

Kudos to George Clooney for his outstanding job in co-writing and directing this (as well as acting in it). The movie is incredibly tight, in its scope (it distills the gist of the Murrow vs McCarthy story into a few episodes, further distilled into just 93 minutes of film), in its shots (much of the camera work is very close up, and nearly all of the scenes are in the newsroom), and in its texture (done in black-and-white, with no musical score behind most of the scenes, but perfectly punctuated with Diana Reeves singing jazz numbers). At one point, Murrow delivers the news of a colleague's death, and ends it saying ""that's not much of an obit, but it's just the facts, it was brief, and that's how he would have wanted it.""  This film was delivered with that same just-the-facts newsy efficiency that typified Murrow himself. Clooney does no preaching with the script, nor dramatization with the camerawork; rather, he lets the plain story speak for itself, knowing that the material itself will give a more powerful impact of itself than any cinematic contrivance could add to. In fact, the script in many places is drawn straight from actual historical transcript, and the film is seamlessly interwoven with period news footage. (McCarthy himself is not enacted, but is drawn entirely from period footage.) David Strathairn positively channels Edward R. Murrow (more Oscar material), and the rest of the cast, including Ray Wise, Frank Langella, Robert Downey Jr., Patricia Clarkson, Jeff Daniels, and Clooney were all flawless as Murrow's newsroom colleagues.I've heard a couple of reviewers use the word ""caustrophobic"" in describing the texture of this film, because of the tight shots and keeping the scenes nearly all in the newsroom. I think those techniques effectively heightened the palpable fear and pressure the characters felt, but I did not find it suffocating (in the way that other biopics can be -- Oliver Stone's Nixon or Bob Fosse's psuedo-autobiography All That Jazz come to mind). The style was spare, which I think actually gave the story room to breathe. The film was no more claustrophobic than is a newspaper story for being confined to the printed page.

But the early '50s was also a time of great paranoia and fear in the United States, when Sen. Joe McCarthy led a witch hunt for Communist sympathizers on American soil.More than 50 years later, McCarthy to me was little more than a symbol of government gone astray. Edward R. Murrow, the newsman who brought McCarthy down, was just a name.Now, ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" has made me feel like I lived through it all, and I can imagine what it must have been like in those early days of television when two giants contended over issues of human rights, dignity and freedom.Artfully using archival footage of McCarthy and others from the era, this black-and-white film directed by George Clooney is like a breath of fresh air ... particularly in a day when movies are judged by the number of special effects they employ. As Murrow, David Strathairn is amazing, cool under pressure and diligent in upholding his beliefs. Other cast members, including Clooney, Frank Langella, Robert Downey Jr., Patricia Clarkson and Jeff Daniels, help bring the turbulent time to life.The political message as it relates to today is certainly relevant, but the subtext is never overt.

641873,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JOKM,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 5]","Beautifully shot in black and white (with lots of the 50s archive footages), `Good Night, and Good Luck' bring us back to the days of Senator Joseph McCarthy. Its downbeat pace and nearly confined location in TV broadcasting studios are not for everyone's taste, and any people who would be interested in this subject matter have already known the consequences of the battle between the journalism represented by CBS and Edward Murrow, and the political power.Still, George Clooney-directed `Good Night, and Good Luck' has one merit; it has authentic feel of the time and place -- a close look at the earlier days of hectic TV broadcasting system, for example - and riveting acting from David Strathairn as Murrow. Look carefully at his performance, and you will notice that he expresses, under the dead serious face of Murrow sitting calmly before the TV camera with a cigarette, another Murrow, nervous and vulnerable.But we are not allowed to know much about Murrow and his life. The film is more about the still on-going relations between the media and the politics, and it poses several thought-provoking questions as to the functions of television in our society. Edward Murrow refuses to be content with his `victory' as the initial scene of the film suggests, but as the film goes on, what he aims for begins to look, to most of us I think, unattainable. Suppose you choose a show to watch, which do you prefer, Ed Sullivan or Ed Murrow? But who decides what to watch? The brief confrontation between Morrow and the CBS boss Bill Paley (Frank Langella, very good) provides insightful view that could have been more powerful with a more emotionally approach.[REFUSES TO SHOW CERTAIN THINGS] The film provides lighter moments with a love affair episode of the characters played by Patricia Clarkson and Robert Downey Jr. Another memorable (and more serious and tragic) episodes are about Don Hollenbeck superbly played by Ray Wise. In both cases, what those characters feel is only suggested by the actors' face and gestures. The inner side of Edward Murrow remains enigmatic. As Joseph McCarthy here is stuck in the archive footages, the camera that shoots Edward Murrow and his colleges to lesser degree refuses to go down to the deeper places of their heart.For me, the best film that deals with this stormy age is much underrated `The Front' starring Woody Allen and after watching `Good Night, and Good Luck' my opinion doesn't change. And I don't share the political ideas that Clooney must have, but still it is true that George Clooney proved his talent as director by re-introducing a page of American history in his original fashion without being preachy.",4,Excellent Acting and Well-Observed Details Make Up for the Lack of Emotion,1149120000,"06 1, 2006",2006,2671,"['Beautifully', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'lots', '50s', 'archive', 'footages', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'bring', 'back', 'days', 'Senator', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'downbeat', 'pace', 'nearly', 'confined', 'location', 'TV', 'broadcasting', 'studios', 'are', 'not', 'everyone', 'taste', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'subject', 'matter', 'have', 'already', 'known', 'consequences', 'battle', 'journalism', 'represented', 'CBS', 'Edward', 'Murrow', 'political', 'power.Still', 'George', 'Clooney-directed', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'one', 'merit', 'authentic', 'feel', 'time', 'place', 'close', 'look', 'earlier', 'days', 'hectic', 'TV', 'broadcasting', 'system', 'example', 'riveting', 'acting', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'Murrow', 'Look', 'carefully', 'performance', 'will', 'notice', 'dead', 'serious', 'face', 'Murrow', 'sitting', 'calmly', 'TV', 'camera', 'cigarette', 'Murrow', 'nervous', 'vulnerable.But', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'know', 'much', 'Murrow', 'life', 'film', 'more', 'still', 'on-going', 'relations', 'media', 'politics', 'several', 'thought-provoking', 'questions', 'functions', 'television', 'society', 'Edward', 'Murrow', 'be', 'content', 'victory', 'initial', 'scene', 'film', 'film', 'what', 'begins', 'look', 'most', 'think', 'unattainable', 'Suppose', 'choose', 'show', 'watch', 'do', 'prefer', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'Ed', 'Murrow', 'who', 'what', 'watch', 'brief', 'confrontation', 'Morrow', 'CBS', 'boss', 'Bill', 'Paley', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'very', 'good', 'insightful', 'view', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'powerful', 'more', 'emotionally', 'approach', '[', 'REFUSES', 'TO', 'SHOW', 'CERTAIN', 'THINGS', ']', 'film', 'lighter', 'moments', 'love', 'affair', 'episode', 'characters', 'played', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'memorable', 'more', 'serious', 'tragic', 'episodes', 'are', 'Don', 'Hollenbeck', 'superbly', 'played', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'cases', 'what', 'characters', 'feel', 'only', 'suggested', 'actors', 'face', 'gestures', 'inner', 'side', 'Edward', 'Murrow', 'enigmatic', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'here', 'stuck', 'archive', 'footages', 'camera', 'Edward', 'Murrow', 'colleges', 'lesser', 'degree', 'refuses', 'go', 'down', 'deeper', 'places', 'heart.For', 'best', 'film', 'stormy', 'age', 'much', 'underrated', 'Front', 'starring', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'watching', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'opinion', ""n't"", 'change', 'do', ""n't"", 'share', 'political', 'ideas', 'Clooney', 'must', 'have', 'still', 'true', 'George', 'Clooney', 'proved', 'talent', 'director', 're-introducing', 'page', 'American', 'history', 'original', 'fashion', 'being', 'preachy']",N/A

641877,A6S8DJ4TOM2BF,B00005JOKM,Wade Tomlin,"[1, 1]","Good Night and Good Luck is the exact antidote to the current entertainment reporting we often confuse as news and the current big budget pictures we often accept as important.George Clooney reveals Edward R. Murrow's true grit in his challenging of Joseph McCarthy's hunt for communists in mid-1950's America. Instead of seeming to be on an agenda or over stepping his bounds, David Strathairn's Murrow comes across as a journalist who allowed the facts to lead him to an unavoidable conclusion about McCarthy's activities.Murrow used his show 'See It Now' to dissect the horrible tactics that lied at the heart of the blacklist practice and as a result truly added to the debate in his country, while testing the patience of the company who paid his cheque. Strathairn plays Murrow completely believably as a normal guy who was able to be conduct himself always as a professional while working for CBS, while still being dogged in his committment to the importance of honest discussion about political events, even to the point of annoyance of his CBS co-workers and bosses.The true genius of the movie is the way the script, directed by Clooney, a confirmed Liberal, is able to allow the full debate of the mix between the public's need to know and their desire to be entertained to be aired. This movie actually does a wonderful job presenting the counter arguement to Murrow's activities as a journalist in some beautifully illuminated scenes vocalized in a great performance by Frank Langella as Murrow's boss.As director Clooney keeps everything tight and claustrophobic, ratcheting up the tension as all the scenes take place in small quarters, which is further aided by the black and white photography leaving a very small film dominated by huge issues. This small feel makes Good Night and Good Luck the exact opposite of what is presented in most films and many news broadcasts. The end result is a film that presents issues that regardless of the time-period have an importance in our current world.",5,A Needed Historical Film,1181347200,"06 9, 2007",2007,2011,"['Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'exact', 'antidote', 'current', 'entertainment', 'reporting', 'often', 'confuse', 'news', 'current', 'big', 'budget', 'often', 'accept', 'important.George', 'Clooney', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'true', 'grit', 'challenging', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'hunt', 'communists', 'mid-1950', 'America', 'Instead', 'seeming', 'be', 'agenda', 'stepping', 'bounds', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'Murrow', 'across', 'journalist', 'who', 'allowed', 'facts', 'lead', 'unavoidable', 'conclusion', 'McCarthy', 'activities.Murrow', 'used', 'show', 'Now', 'dissect', 'horrible', 'tactics', 'lied', 'heart', 'blacklist', 'practice', 'result', 'truly', 'added', 'debate', 'country', 'testing', 'patience', 'company', 'who', 'paid', 'cheque', 'Strathairn', 'Murrow', 'completely', 'believably', 'normal', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'able', 'be', 'conduct', 'always', 'professional', 'while', 'working', 'CBS', 'still', 'being', 'dogged', 'committment', 'importance', 'honest', 'discussion', 'political', 'events', 'even', 'point', 'annoyance', 'CBS', 'co-workers', 'bosses.The', 'true', 'genius', 'movie', 'way', 'script', 'directed', 'Clooney', 'confirmed', 'Liberal', 'able', 'allow', 'full', 'debate', 'mix', 'public', 'need', 'know', 'desire', 'be', 'entertained', 'be', 'aired', 'movie', 'actually', 'wonderful', 'job', 'presenting', 'counter', 'arguement', 'Murrow', 'activities', 'journalist', 'beautifully', 'illuminated', 'scenes', 'vocalized', 'great', 'performance', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'Murrow', 'boss.As', 'director', 'Clooney', 'everything', 'tight', 'claustrophobic', 'ratcheting', 'up', 'tension', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'small', 'quarters', 'further', 'aided', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'leaving', 'very', 'small', 'film', 'dominated', 'huge', 'issues', 'small', 'feel', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'exact', 'opposite', 'what', 'presented', 'most', 'films', 'many', 'news', 'broadcasts', 'end', 'result', 'film', 'issues', 'regardless', 'time-period', 'have', 'importance', 'current', 'world']",N/A

Red,"[10, 12]","Unlike many films that build off biography and the events of the past (e.g., ""The Aviator""), ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" tries scrupulously to reproduce the events it protrays, down to using many of Edward R. Murrow's exact words and cutting in real footage of Senator Joseph McCarthy and his Senate hearings. This approach moves it far closer to a documentary than other Hollywood productions. The long-lens black and white photography, which brings the foreground into exquisite relief while blurring the distance, also helps to create an atmosphere of grainy verisimilitude. True to history, the newsmen all smoke, creating a swirling haze that contributes to the photographic effect. Really dazzling.The meticulous acting of David Strathairn, a brilliant casting choice for Murrow, and George Clooney's restrained and ironic presentation -- both as co-director and in his part as Murrow's producer Fred Friendly -- give this film emotional subtlety and intellectual power. I'm so pleased to see Strathairn in a part really deserving of his considerable talent. And I have to say that the mobile face in black and white of Robert Downey, Jr., as Joe Wershba (one of Murrow's colleagues), is a feast for the eyes. McCarthy, of course, plays himself in newsreel footage, which is also an intelligent decision, explained in the commentary on the film, because it keeps his character from toppling over into caricature and allows the film to explore journalistic ethics without being too heavy-handed about its moral position. Of course, that position is there, but as Murrow advocated that journalism has a role in public argument, it's only right that this film take a position too.Because the film so scrupulously reflects history, the storytelling is not as tight as it might be. The romantic ""subplot"" between Wershba and his wife - the commentary says the backers told Clooney and his co-director Grant Heslov that they needed a woman in the newsroom -  feels like a distraction, and since no ""actor"" is playing McCarthy, there is a lot that cannot be done in the way of direct confrontation between the principal characters. Suspense is a little lacking also, chiefly because any educated person knows what really happened. But Clooney and Heslov do a good job of working around these limitations.In addition to directors' commentary, the DVD also includes an excellent companion piece, which interviews Murrow's and Friendly's children, as well as surviving Murrow colleagues.  Dianne Reeves' singing (the film imagines her as a kind of Greek chorus) is also highly enjoyable -- I'm planning on buying this film's soundtrack too; can't remember the last time I wanted to do that!",4,"Brilliant Performance by Strathairn, Smart Directing by Clooney et al.",1147996800,"05 19, 2006",2006,2686,"['many', 'films', 'build', 'biography', 'events', 'past', 'e.g.', 'Aviator', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'scrupulously', 'reproduce', 'events', 'down', 'using', 'many', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'exact', 'words', 'cutting', 'real', 'footage', 'Senator', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'Senate', 'hearings', 'approach', 'far', 'closer', 'documentary', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'productions', 'long-lens', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'foreground', 'exquisite', 'relief', 'blurring', 'distance', 'also', 'create', 'atmosphere', 'grainy', 'verisimilitude', 'True', 'history', 'newsmen', 'smoke', 'creating', 'swirling', 'haze', 'photographic', 'effect', 'Really', 'dazzling.The', 'meticulous', 'acting', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'brilliant', 'casting', 'choice', 'Murrow', 'George', 'Clooney', 'restrained', 'ironic', 'presentation', 'co-director', 'part', 'Murrow', 'producer', 'Fred', 'Friendly', 'give', 'film', 'emotional', 'subtlety', 'intellectual', 'power', ""'m"", 'so', 'pleased', 'see', 'Strathairn', 'part', 'really', 'deserving', 'considerable', 'talent', 'have', 'say', 'mobile', 'face', 'black', 'white', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Joe', 'Wershba', 'one', 'Murrow', 'colleagues', 'feast', 'eyes', 'McCarthy', 'course', 'newsreel', 'footage', 'also', 'intelligent', 'decision', 'explained', 'commentary', 'film', 'character', 'toppling', 'over', 'caricature', 'film', 'explore', 'journalistic', 'ethics', 'being', 'too', 'heavy-handed', 'moral', 'position', 'course', 'position', 'there', 'Murrow', 'advocated', 'journalism', 'role', 'public', 'argument', 'only', 'right', 'film', 'take', 'position', 'film', 'so', 'scrupulously', 'history', 'storytelling', 'not', 'as', 'tight', 'might', 'be', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'Wershba', 'wife', 'commentary', 'backers', 'told', 'Clooney', 'co-director', 'Grant', 'Heslov', 'needed', 'woman', 'newsroom', 'feels', 'distraction', 'actor', 'playing', 'McCarthy', 'lot', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'done', 'way', 'direct', 'confrontation', 'principal', 'characters', 'Suspense', 'little', 'lacking', 'also', 'chiefly', 'educated', 'person', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'Clooney', 'Heslov', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'working', 'limitations.In', 'addition', 'directors', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'also', 'excellent', 'companion', 'piece', 'Murrow', 'Friendly', 'children', 'as', 'well', 'surviving', 'Murrow', 'colleagues', 'Dianne', 'Reeves', 'singing', 'film', 'kind', 'Greek', 'chorus', 'also', 'highly', 'enjoyable', ""'m"", 'planning', 'buying', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'too', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'last', 'time', 'wanted', 'do']",N/A
