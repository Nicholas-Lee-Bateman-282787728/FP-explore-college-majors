Mitchell ""Jet Jock""","[1, 1]","Laugher is healthful and relieves stress, not to mention making you feel good.Eddie Izzard is witty, intelligent, and just downright funny. He is unlike any other person I have heard called a ""Stand Up Comic"". I would call him more of a social satirist. He touches on history, culture, philosphy, religion, politics,----nothing is off limits. You HAVE to hear him doing the voices of God and Jesus. Normally I am touchy about people using Christianity for jokes but this is not only not offensive it is HILARIOUS.I have everything available of his, on DVD. ""Dressed to Kill"" is the one that I have watched 12 times now. It is my ""go to"" DVD when the whole week has stunk and I need a litle escape.Of course the British accent lends itself to additional laughter in the way he uses it. If you have any trouble with British accents put the closed captioning on---it will greatly improve your enjoyment.I LOVE EDDIE-----makes me laugh just thinking of some of the things he says.
