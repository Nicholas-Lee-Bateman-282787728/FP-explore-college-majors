100140,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0790732262,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","My wife and I were rather excited to watch this film, beings that it stars some of our favorite actors.  Jack Nicholson has always been one of my favorites, for he is always entertaining and genuinely talented.  Susan Sarandon is a goddess as far as I'm concerned, and my wife just about adores everything Michelle Pfeiffer has lent her name to.  Cher is a recent crush for the both of us.  We have become entranced by the actress just this year, watching her waltz into our hearts with memorable and charming performances in films like `Mermaids', `Moonstruck' and `Mask'.With an all-star cast like this one it is bound to succeed, right?Wrong.I wish I could say that I enjoyed this film entirely, but the most I can say is that in parts it works fine.  As a whole the film falls apart, and even when it is funny and or engaging it is a short-lived excitement that gives way to meandering monotony.My wife and I deemed this the poor man's `Death Becomes Her'.Both films have a similar vibe, but only `Death Becomes Her' actually matches its stars with worthy comedic material.  The material here is sparse at best, and it actually allows itself to fall completely to pieces towards the end.Three friends, Alex, Jane and Sukie, conjure up the perfect man one evening over wine and candlelight, unaware that they have magical powers making this `perfect man' come to life.  When Daryl Van Horne appears in the town of Eastwick they are immediately repulsed then strangely drawn in by his seductive powers and soon become pawns in his dastardly plan that only one woman seems to be privy to.  That one woman is Felicia Alden, Sukie's old boss who happens to become somewhat clairvoyant after an accident.The script is shaky at best and really gives the actors little to work with, but they all try really hard, some succeeding far greater than others.  Jack Nicholson is hammy as ever, but he does hammy so well, so why fault him.  It is not as effective as his work in, say, `The Shining', but it is equal parts creepy and funny.  Cher is at the bottom of her performances with this one, as is Michelle Pfeiffer.  Neither actress is given much of an arc or a reason to care about them.  Cher has her feisty moments, but they are not enough to garner her much attention.  Susan Sarandon is delightful here, proving to be a shining star in a vast sea of mediocrity.  It doesn't hurt that her character is the only one slightly interesting, and it is the showiest of the bunch, but she wears it well (when doesn't she) and so she gets major points for that.  Still, the only reason to watch this movie is for Veronica Cartwright who just devours her character (Felicia) with every ounce of vivacious personality needed to sell her and the movie.  She's only in about half the film, so once she leaves I advise giving up on the film all together (the ending is particularly preposterous) but if you're anything like me you'll have to finish it for the mere fact that you can never watch just `half a movie'.I wish I could say stay far, far away, but Cartwright deserves at least one viewing.",2,This one isn't running on all cylinders...,1244505600,"06 9, 2009",2009,3086,"['wife', 'were', 'rather', 'excited', 'watch', 'film', 'beings', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorites', 'always', 'entertaining', 'genuinely', 'talented', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'goddess', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'wife', 'just', 'adores', 'everything', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'lent', 'name', 'Cher', 'recent', 'crush', 'have', 'become', 'entranced', 'actress', 'just', 'year', 'watching', 'waltz', 'hearts', 'memorable', 'charming', 'performances', 'films', 'Mermaids', 'Moonstruck', ""Mask'.With"", 'all-star', 'cast', 'one', 'bound', 'succeed', 'right', 'Wrong.I', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'entirely', 'most', 'can', 'say', 'parts', 'fine', 'whole', 'film', 'apart', 'even', 'when', 'funny', 'engaging', 'short-lived', 'excitement', 'way', 'meandering', 'monotony.My', 'wife', 'deemed', 'poor', 'man', 'Death', 'Becomes', ""Her'.Both"", 'films', 'have', 'similar', 'vibe', 'only', 'Death', 'Becomes', 'Her', 'actually', 'stars', 'worthy', 'comedic', 'material', 'material', 'here', 'sparse', 'best', 'actually', 'fall', 'completely', 'pieces', 'end.Three', 'friends', 'Alex', 'Jane', 'Sukie', 'conjure', 'up', 'perfect', 'man', 'one', 'evening', 'wine', 'candlelight', 'unaware', 'have', 'magical', 'powers', 'making', 'perfect', 'man', 'come', 'life', 'When', 'Daryl', 'Van', 'Horne', 'town', 'Eastwick', 'are', 'immediately', 'repulsed', 'then', 'strangely', 'drawn', 'seductive', 'powers', 'soon', 'become', 'pawns', 'dastardly', 'plan', 'only', 'one', 'woman', 'be', 'privy', 'one', 'woman', 'Felicia', 'Alden', 'Sukie', 'old', 'boss', 'who', 'become', 'somewhat', 'clairvoyant', 'accident.The', 'script', 'shaky', 'best', 'really', 'actors', 'little', 'work', 'try', 'really', 'hard', 'succeeding', 'far', 'greater', 'others', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'hammy', 'ever', 'hammy', 'so', 'well', 'so', 'why', 'fault', 'not', 'as', 'effective', 'work', 'say', 'Shining', 'equal', 'parts', 'creepy', 'funny', 'Cher', 'bottom', 'performances', 'one', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'actress', 'given', 'much', 'arc', 'reason', 'care', 'Cher', 'feisty', 'moments', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'garner', 'much', 'attention', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'delightful', 'here', 'proving', 'be', 'shining', 'star', 'vast', 'sea', 'mediocrity', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'character', 'only', 'one', 'slightly', 'interesting', 'showiest', 'bunch', 'well', 'when', ""n't"", 'so', 'major', 'points', 'Still', 'only', 'reason', 'watch', 'movie', 'Veronica', 'Cartwright', 'who', 'just', 'character', 'Felicia', 'ounce', 'vivacious', 'personality', 'needed', 'sell', 'movie', 'only', 'about', 'film', 'so', 'once', 'advise', 'giving', 'up', 'film', 'together', 'ending', 'particularly', 'preposterous', ""'re"", 'anything', ""'ll"", 'have', 'finish', 'mere', 'fact', 'can', 'never', 'watch', 'just', ""movie'.I"", 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'stay', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'Cartwright', 'least', 'one', 'viewing']",N/A

100142,A1534MBU6VJXYN,0790732262,"Anthony Nasti ""Tony""","[5, 8]","Jank Nicholson seems born to play the most of the roles he plays, whether it's Melvin Udall, the Joker, or Randall P. McMurphy. Another he always seemed tailor made for was the devil. His dark demeanor, his black sense of humor and even his look made him an ideal choice for Old Scratch. Well, in 1987, Nicholson got a chance to play the role of a lifetime in the adaptation of John Updike's classic novel ""The Witches Of Eastwick"". Nicholson chews the scenery and steals the show.Alex Medford (Cher), Jane Spofford (Susan Sarandon) and Sukie Ridgemont (Michelle Pfeiffer) are three lonely, upset woman. They have either been widowed (Alex), divorced (Jane), or deserted (Sukie). One night, as they gather for a weekly night of card playing and conversation, they wish for the perfect man.Enter Daryl Van Horne (Nicholson), a brooding, sinister man who has (literally) cast a spell on the small New England town, but still claims to be ""your average horny little devil"". One by one, he seduces the three girls until they give themselves to sins of the flesh. Daryl showers the women with gifts and brings a sense of la dolce vita to the lives of these girls. But as Daryl's presence of the girls becomes more prominent, so do strange occurences in the small town of Eastwick. People start dying, Sukie winds up in the hospital, and the three girls are despised by the town. To make matters worse, all three girls are pregnant. As Daryl begins to show his true identity, the girls are thrust into a game of cat and mouse to stop further tragedy from occuring in Eastwick.This film is absolutely amazing. Nicholson is everything you expect him to be: crude, intimidating and slightly insane. From his outrageous conversation with Alex over lunch to his speech about how women were a mistake at the church near the end, every scene is pure Nicholson. Of course, credit must go to the three women as well. Cher gives one of her best performances ever. 1987 proved to be a big year for Cher, starring in three critically acclaimed films: this, ""Suspect"" and her Oscar winning performance in ""Moonstruck"". Susan Sarandon finally gets a chance to rise above her cult status as Janet Weiss from ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" and gives a memorable performance as Jane. Indeed, when you think about it, Janet and Jane can both be seen as similar characters, as both go from nerdy all Americans to carefree women giving themselves over to absolute pleasure (no pun intended), no matter what the consequence. And then there's Michelle Pfeiffer. Well, she puts on one of her all time greatest performances here, exuding a high amount of sex appeal (which she would use to full force when she played Catwoman in ""Batman Returns"" five years later) as well as proving that even at a young stage in her career, she can hold her own against Jack Nicholson (she already had proved herself worthy to go up against Pacino for years earlier in ""Scarface"").This is definitely a must see movie. It is one of the best horror-comedies ever, and the outstanding cast gives you enough reason to watch this movie.",5,Breathtakingly Scary And Outrageously Funny,1120435200,"07 4, 2005",2005,3086,"['Jank', 'Nicholson', 'born', 'play', 'most', 'roles', 'Melvin', 'Udall', 'Joker', 'Randall', 'P.', 'McMurphy', 'always', 'seemed', 'tailor', 'made', 'was', 'devil', 'dark', 'demeanor', 'black', 'sense', 'humor', 'even', 'look', 'made', 'ideal', 'choice', 'Old', 'Scratch', 'Well', '1987', 'Nicholson', 'got', 'chance', 'play', 'role', 'lifetime', 'adaptation', 'John', 'Updike', 'classic', 'novel', 'Witches', 'Eastwick', 'Nicholson', 'scenery', 'show.Alex', 'Medford', 'Cher', 'Jane', 'Spofford', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Sukie', 'Ridgemont', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'are', 'three', 'lonely', 'upset', 'woman', 'have', 'been', 'widowed', 'Alex', 'divorced', 'Jane', 'deserted', 'Sukie', 'One', 'night', 'gather', 'weekly', 'night', 'card', 'playing', 'conversation', 'wish', 'perfect', 'man.Enter', 'Daryl', 'Van', 'Horne', 'Nicholson', 'brooding', 'sinister', 'man', 'who', 'literally', 'cast', 'spell', 'small', 'New', 'England', 'town', 'still', 'claims', 'be', 'average', 'horny', 'little', 'devil', 'One', 'one', 'three', 'girls', 'give', 'sins', 'flesh', 'Daryl', 'women', 'gifts', 'sense', 'la', 'dolce', 'vita', 'lives', 'girls', 'Daryl', 'presence', 'girls', 'more', 'prominent', 'so', 'do', 'strange', 'occurences', 'small', 'town', 'Eastwick', 'People', 'start', 'dying', 'Sukie', 'up', 'hospital', 'three', 'girls', 'are', 'despised', 'town', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'three', 'girls', 'are', 'pregnant', 'Daryl', 'show', 'true', 'identity', 'girls', 'are', 'thrust', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'stop', 'further', 'tragedy', 'occuring', 'Eastwick.This', 'film', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'Nicholson', 'everything', 'expect', 'be', 'crude', 'intimidating', 'slightly', 'insane', 'outrageous', 'conversation', 'Alex', 'lunch', 'speech', 'how', 'women', 'were', 'mistake', 'church', 'end', 'scene', 'pure', 'Nicholson', 'course', 'credit', 'must', 'go', 'three', 'women', 'as', 'well', 'Cher', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'ever', '1987', 'proved', 'be', 'big', 'year', 'Cher', 'starring', 'three', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'films', 'Suspect', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'performance', 'Moonstruck', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'finally', 'chance', 'rise', 'cult', 'status', 'Janet', 'Weiss', 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'Picture', 'Show', 'memorable', 'performance', 'Jane', 'Indeed', 'when', 'think', 'Janet', 'Jane', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'similar', 'characters', 'go', 'nerdy', 'Americans', 'carefree', 'women', 'giving', 'absolute', 'pleasure', 'pun', 'intended', 'matter', 'what', 'consequence', 'then', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Well', 'one', 'time', 'greatest', 'performances', 'here', 'exuding', 'high', 'amount', 'sex', 'appeal', 'would', 'use', 'full', 'force', 'when', 'played', 'Catwoman', 'Batman', 'Returns', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'as', 'well', 'proving', 'even', 'young', 'stage', 'career', 'can', 'hold', 'own', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'already', 'had', 'proved', 'worthy', 'go', 'up', 'Pacino', 'years', 'earlier', 'Scarface', '.This', 'definitely', 'must', 'see', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'horror-comedies', 'ever', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'enough', 'reason', 'watch', 'movie']",N/A

I wondered why, so I decided to view the movie again. Now, I can plainly see what was so bad about it. Of any, the script was the worst feature of the film. It's all mumbo jumbo with no connection to reality. Because of that, it made The Witches of Eastwick unbearable to watch. Watching Jack Nicholson to play this sex-crazed character, which he is exactly that in real life, was nauseating for me to watch. Then, adding the three annoying actresses (Cher, Susan Sarandon, and Michelle Pfeiffer) into the mix was like adding more salt to the wound. Finally, the inexplicable idea of allowing this crazy bug-eyed female character so she can curse everybody out and throw up incessantly all over the room was the final nail of the coffin. Obviously, there was zero interaction between the main characters and the folks of the town, so it became a very unrealistic movie to watch, considering the circumstances. Check out the ending: it pretty much meant that these three kids are actually spawns of a devil.

She has released a few albums in the 80s, which were 'I Paralyze' in 1982, 'Cher' in 1987 (her second album that was self-titled), and 'Heart Of Stone' in 1989. In 1987, Cher has starred in three movies back to back, which were 'Suspect', where she played Kathleen Riley, 'Moonstruck', where she played Loretta Castorini, and 'The Witches Of Eastwick', where she played Alexandra Medford. The Witches Of Eastwick is a comedy-thriller, containing elements of comedy, fantasy, love, desire, and a little touch of horror.Taking place in the small town of Eastwick, where nothing really exciting happens, three girlfriends Alexandra 'Alex' Medford (played by Cher), Jane Spfford (played by Susan Sarandon), and Sukie Ridgemont (played by Michelle Pfeiffer) are in desperate need of men who will give them the love they are longing for. All three were married, but they each suffered the three D's: Death, Desertion, Divorce. Alex's husband has passed on: Death. Sukie's husband has left her: Desertion. And Jane's husband had divorced her: Divorce. On a rainy Thursday night, Sukie and Jane drive up to Alex's house to have a girls night out. While drinking martini's and discussing how much they need men in their lives, they start describing what they really want in a man. That literally draws a stranger to Eastwick. He has just bought the Lenox mansion, an old mansion that was owned by Mr. Lenox before he died. Jane is a cello player, and while giving a performance, with all of Eastwick watching, they all meet the stranger. Everyone is interested him, but they all do not know his name. Sukie works for the Eastwick paper and has been asked to interview the stranger, but cannot remember his name.. Alex and Sukie see Jane holding a boque of flowers. Jane says they are from the stranger, but on the card is just the initial D. Sukie suddenly remembers that his name started with a D, and then remembers that there is also an R in the name, as well as an L. She finally remembers his full name: Daryl Van Horne (played by Jack Nicholson). Daryl meets the three women individually, starting with Alex. He invites her to lunch and shows the personalities that Alex has hated in every man she has ever met, but as much as she wants to hate him for his personalities, she can't help but want him in every sexual way. And that, Daryl proves when the two spend the night together. He then meets Jane. He is enthused by Jane's cellist playing. But tells her that her bowing sucks. As he teaches her to let the passion out, Jane becomes more than turned on and spends the night with Daryl. Alex and Sukie go on up to the mansion, where the find Jane there as well. Alex and Jane, still very much turned on, and somewhat in love, find Daryl turning on the charm when he finally meets Sukie. The four go for a tennis match, leading them to take a swim in Daryl's in-door pool, where Sukie and Daryl spend the night together. Three become Daryl's latest flames. But as they continue to have a good time with Daryl, evil things around Eastwick begin happening, such as the death of Felicia Alden (played by Veronica Cartwright), the annoying wife of Sukie's boss, Clyde Alden (played by Richard Jenkins). The three of them decide to cut off Daryl, for they realize that Daryl is not a man, but the Devil Himself...literally. How can they send Daryl howling back to Hell?

The entire cast is very good, with Jack Nicholson being an especially inspired choice as the satanic Daryl Van Horn.  Veronica Cartwright also stands out as the town busybody.  The film is most interesting in the beginning, as it appears that we will be watching a sly criticism of conventional morality, but the script quickly goes astray.  It appears as though Cartwright is intended to be an intolerant Phyllis Schlafly type, but that doesn't really work since she becomes the victim of magical forces from the instant Daryl enters town, making her a very sympathetic figure instead.  We should have been given an opportunity to revel along with the three friends in the break from conformism that their unconventional relationship with Van Horn provides, but since we viewers are aware that Van Horn is actually persecuting Cartwright's character without provocation, they merely come off as ignorant dupes of a duplicitous male instead of examples of female empowerment.  By the end of the movie, we are watching a very conventional (though not scary) horror film as the three women try to send the devil back where he came from.

100173,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,0790732262,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 2]","This film has to be compared with Stephen King's book  Needful Things . The devil is called into a middle-sized town by three women who are free of any husband. When they think the same thing together it happens. So they dream of their ideal man and here he is. They get mesmerized by the man and they build with him a little family. Three plus one is four. It would be perfect if they did not change. But they do change. They start giving free reein to their creativity and thus they become disturbing for the town. Some old puritan women become very suspiciouos and then hostile. But Mister Devil decides to destroy this opposition and he kills the main inspiratress of this opposition. The three women then wake up and find out that they all are pregnant, and that they do not want any harm to be done to other people. So they first send him to hell, which, being the devil,he does not like and he tries to get his revenge onto them by making them suffer. So they decide to send him back to where he came from with his own devices, that is to say some kind of black magic and voodoo. And they succeed. His only way to come back is through television waves. But you can easily switch it off. So he is trapped overthere and he has become harmless.The main difference with  Needful Things  is that the devil does not, here, buys everyone in the village using their deep desires for some objects and then trading those for some misdeeds committed against other members of the village. He just captures three women and makes them his objects. He only becomes bad when the town decides to turn against him, and the women in their wake. So it is fundamentally a comedy , not a horror story. The second element is that the devil is not trying to destroy, to spread evil acts surging from evil desires in men and women, but only to get his pleasure out of the three women he has captured. The film reveals the puritan reactions of a wide section of the older population of the town. The next difference is that the three women get to some kind of unity against him through their desire to protect the other inhabitants of the city. King shows that the unity can only be achieved if one brings together all the others, or at least all the survivors by exposing the devil in his deeds. This unifying member of the community is the sheriff, which is typical of King, but in many ways very standard in the American culture : the sheriff is the natural protector of the community. In the film, the protection comes from women, showing how wrong the devil is when he preaches, in the church, mind you, the evil nature of women. He preaches that when he is confronted to the hostility of the three rebellious  witches . This is a very modern element in American culture:  women, and what's more witches, are the natural protection of a community against evil and the devil. This is set in perspective when we remember (and the film gives us that element) that witches started being exposed and burnt when what they were up to the XVth century, that is to say midwives, became a competition to doctors and doctors had to get rid of them to clear their profesional field. So this film is very progressive on the subject : witches are not the devil's weapons, but the best protection a community can have against the devil because they know his tools and weapons and can clearly keep him away.Jack Nicholson is an admirable  and marvellous devil. A masterpiece in acting, even if it is a role that he plays too often, the role of a deranged person, of an abnormal person, of a person who is standing beyond the limits of normality.

100182,A9TG2NFA614S9,0790732262,John F. Rooney,"[1, 1]","In ""The Witches of Eastwick"" (1987) Jack Nicholson proves he is the tantrum king, the enfant terrible of films. In the ironing scene he goes ballistic as only he can. And later in the church scene he proves how over the wall and out of the ballpark he can get when he is teed off. In his overly enthusiastic endorsement of the concert, he has the concert audience aghast. His eyes roll, his whole cookie dough face contorts, his brow crinkles, and his wild hair adds to the manic behavior.Nicholson always stakes out his space and never gives an inch as the super star. He mesmerizes us, fascinates us, and does not loosen his hold on our attention. In this flick he's a funny, charming, overgrown kid who has to have his devilish way. We hear criticism that he's always playing Jack Nicholson. Well, of course, who else would we want him to be?We go to a Nicholson film to watch him disintegrate before our very eyes. In this flick his wardrobe is completely outlandish because we are, after all, dealing with the devil. Even in this early movie his body was starting to go to pot, becoming lumpy and sodden.After seeing this film, you won't want to eat fresh cherries for a while. Don't mess with the devil.His co-stars Cher, Susan Sarandon and Michele Pfeiffer, the witches of the title, do an excellent job of almost upstaging him.

It had a lot going for it -- based on a best seller by one of America's most distinguished writers, a stellar cast, slick photography, and beautiful locations. But they blew it. One big problem is that you're continually aware of the finicky balancing act the film has to do to give the three female stars exactly equal exposure -- I felt I was watching something put together by agents and lawyers rather than actors and film makers. And (though I haven't read it) the film apparently bears only a vague resemblance to the book. Also, some of the gross scenes (if you've seen it you know what I mean) seem just disgusting rather than scary, and in general the film seems like it can't decide whether to be a charming fantasy or a frightening horror movie, so it opts for being the former with a few horror-type scenes thrown in. And there are the really cheesy special effects that fill up the final scenes. Finally, though Jack Nicholson gives a memorable performance, I thought he often went over the top even considering who he was playing. I found myself yearning for the beautifully understated Walter Huston performance as Old Nick in The Devil and Daniel Webster, which I still think is the best portrayal of the personage in question that I've seen. Interesting that both Huston and Nicholson in these respective films play the violin. Is the devil always a fiddler?

100210,A3V2THQU2RQ1AG,0790732262,Molly C.,"[3, 4]","This is a genre blending film I found at Fry's Horror section for only $2.49 retail. It can be described as a supernatural Battle of the Sexes with horrific, comedic, and dramatic elements with a bizarre love story/ orgy at the center of it. The 3 ""witches"" (Cher, Susan Sarandon, and Michelle Pfeiffer) make a request for the perfect man who is delivered to them in the form of Daryl Van Horne (Jack Nicholson) aka the Devil.According to Daryl, when a man is encountered by a strong woman, his manhood goes limp. The woman is called a ""witch"" and set on fire. This is used to make women scared of men and scared of themselves. Daryl's attention allows the 3 women to embrace their sexuality, fertility, passion, and ambition. Eventually, they realize they no longer need men for anything, including Daryl. This culminates in the ultimate showdown with man vs. women.The SFX quality was good enough to win the BAFTA Award in 1987. The music by John Williams earned him an Oscar and Grammy nomination. Nicholson gives an incredibly over the top performance that was good enough to win both the NY & LA Critics Choice Awards.There is a lot of back story to this as well. Bill Murray was originally set to play Darryl and Cher and Sarandon switched roles once they walked onto the set. The studio execs hassled the director so much that Miller halted production. When they threatened to replace him with another director, Nicholson said he would walk away from the production. This ended the feuding.Favorite Quote: Almost all the dialogue. Cher asks Nicholson's character if he is married. To which he responds, "" I don't believe in it. Good for the man, bad for the woman. She dies, she suffocates. Then the Husband complains that he is f*cking a dead woman and he is the one that killed her. Where is your Husband?"" Cher replies, ""Dead.""DVD Extras: Full Cast & Crew Bios, a set design feature entitled "" Conjuring Eastwick"", a ""Bewitching Look Back"" at the history, Awards, Commentary, Interviews, and a Trailer (which indicates there are deleted scenes missing from the DVD.

This is one such movie.  It's about three love-lost women (Cher, Pfeiffer and Sarandon) who, bored with small town life, shack up with The Devil (Nicholson) who offers them a world of sex, magic and enjoyment.  However, things soon begin to start spiralling out of control, and by that I mean the movie as well as the three girls' situation.It's not that the acting is bad.  Far from it, each member of the cast is perfect, especially Sarandon in an unusually sexy role.  The problem is that the movie can't balance its menacing elements with its funnier ones.  Much of this problem lies with Nicholson, who constantly is forced to move from scary to fun-loving.  Whilst the four leads are floating above a swimming pool or playing a magical game of tennis it skips along quite nicely.

That being said, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed seeing it again, indeed it is one of the funniest, wittiest, and most trenchant comedies I have ever seen.  FOr starters, you have not just 3 first rate actresses, but there is a chemistry between them that is a perfect balance:  Sarandon, passionate yet repressed; Cher, tough yet needy; and Pfeiffer, a protean doll.  They start out as friends in a dull community - not unlike one I lived in nearby - who meet to talk and always wind up talking about men.Underneath their frivolity, there is a mysterious power in which they share, something that only dawns on them slowly when they conjure up a man, Jack Nicholson in his beefy and best prime; his character is a great creation of many layers of mystery, of fun and cruelty.  He seduces each one in turn, drawing them into a life of pleasure and wonderful abandon after a long dry spell in all of their lives.  There is an unforgettable scene where they play tennis as foreplay, controlling the motion of the ball with their powers, which seem to grow in the man's presence but are not dependent on him.  As a scifi afficionado, I must say that the development and elaboration of their powers is handled with great finesse and subtlety, even though they are magical.  That being said, they simply take their power in stride, after a bit of surprise as if it were natural - I believed it completely when I saw it.At this point, the town itself becomes a principal character in a deliciously satirical twist.  One resident in particular, the fabulous Veronika Cartwright, senses that something is wrong, that evil is being born in the community; at great personal cost, she seeks to counter it, angering Nicholson into the only kind of action he knows.  It begins to dawn on the women what his true nature is and they become frightened of the havoc he can wreak.  The story then becomes a fight, which in its own way is both terrifying and hilarious.This is one of my favorite films from the 80s and I would recommend this for all film libraries.

And, there's always the guarantee that Daryl Van Horne will be complaining how many mistakes god makes with women. Such as saying that it's called stuff like ""evil"" and ""religion.""

100230,A1NDYXBX0IAUAY,0790732262,Ronald L. Russell,"[11, 23]","The film ""The Witches of Eastwick"" attempts to answer two questions which have troubled humanity for thousands of years. The first question is ""What is the nature of evil?"" and the second is ""Can human beings triumph over evil, whatever it is?"" While there are flaws and inconsistensies, I enjoyed watching the film as it explored these issues.In this film, three friends (Cher, Susan Sarandon, and Michelle Pfeiffer) are ""without men"" for various reasons (death, desertion, and divorce), and hang out together to entertain themselves. It is shown that when they all wish for the same thing, their wishes reinforce one another and come true (although they are not aware of this). The film generally takes a traditional, and somewhat patriarchal view, that magic generally attracts evil. During one particular evening, they discuss what qualities they would like their ""dream man"" to have, and the next day, he appears in town, in the form of Jack Nicholson, aka Daryl Van Horn, who says he was ""drawn"" to Eastwick. Once one has, for the purpose of being entertained, suspended disbelief in such a being of pure evil who leads people into ""sin"", it seems reasonable that, if such a being did manifest themselves, they might actually be something like Daryl Van Horn, who manifests all of the traditional ""seven deadly sins"" i.e. lust, gluttony, sloth, envy, etc.The town of Eastwick, as depicted in the film, is very idyllic, almost a ""Garden of Eden"", that is, until Daryl shows up. He soon seduces the three friends, somehow knowing exactly the right things to say to them. Suddenly, the good people of the town become gossips, involving themselves in the lives of the three friends, porn magazines begin showing up on the shelves at the newstand, and the relationship of the three friends to Daryl becomes common knowledge. The most striking change takes place in the character of one of the towns leading citizens, Felicity Alden (played by Veronica Cartwright). As soon as she learns of Daryls presence in town, she begins to experience uneasyness, which progresses to broken bones, screaming fits, drooling food from her mouth, slanderous accusations against the three friends, an extremely bi-polar personality, and other unpleasant side effects, including her eventual demise at the hands of her long-suffering husband.The three friends realize what is happening and resolve to not only resist Daryl, but to defeat him. First they shut him out of their lives, with discouraging results, as he knows their deepest fears, and uses these against the friends. However, they then use his own desires to work their way back into his good graces, using their own powers to degrade and ultimately defeat him, in a very humorous manner.I would expect that anyone who sincerely believes in the existence of an actual devil would enjoy seeing him so resoundingly whipped.The two questions are answered as the film unfolds. The nature of evil is identified when, at one point during the film, Daryl asks the townspeople if God made a mistake in creating women (patriarchal attitude showing through here). He then explicity defines ""evil"" for everyone as ""when people make mistakes"", and contrasts that to Gods mistakes, which he defines as ""nature"". So, the nature of evil is essentially defined in the film, not as a corporeal devil, but as people making mistakes, or incorrect choices. Daryl is here essentially admitting that he is nothing more than a personification of the sum total of all the improper choices which people sometimes make. Evil exists because people sometimes choose wrongly.The second question is answered as the viewer is shown that people can CHOOSE to turn away from evil (whatever one believes evil to be) and ultimately succeed, although not neccessarily without effort. In other words, correct choices can be made, rather than incorrect choices. So the final message of the film is an encouraging one, namely that evil CAN be conquered.""The Witches of Eastwick"", and other movies about witches, such as ""Practical Magic"" and ""The Craft"", require one to suspend belief in natural laws, and accept the premise that, ok, some people are special and DO have certain powers. Once this premise is accepted, anything is possible, and the films can be quite entertaining.In this film, Daryl has supernatural abilities, but only up to a certain degree, and this is the first clue that he isn't an actual being, but representative of something else. He can harm others at a distance, can magically control the flight of a tennis ball, and can even levitate people. However, when the girls want bagels and ice cream, he cannot produce them magically, but must drive into town to go shopping. He apparantly cannot magically teleport himself from downtown Eastwick back to his residence, but must drive his car. He is also not immune to the magical efforts of the three friends, who can also make things happen through simultaneous application of their willpower (similar to the ""power of three"" frequently shown on the television show ""Charmed""). Daryl himself admits that he ""only wants peoples attention and respect"", thus revealing the true source of his influence and power, and explaining why his powers are so limited. If he were meant to be understood as a real being, his powers would be much greater. But because he is an representation for the mistakes which people make, his powers do have definite limits, and they become weaker as people learn to make fewer mistakes.The films answer regarding the nature of evil highlights the primary failing of the alternative, traditional answer. Namely, if an actual supernatural entity were responsible for the existence of evil, then humans are not reasonably accountable for their evil actions. The films answer to the second question shows that the contemporary view is the correct one, i.e. rather than blaming evil on ""the devil"", humans are shown to be free moral agents with the ability to choose their course, which places blame where it belongs, on the person performing the ""evil"" action, rather than on an invisible ""devil"".The word ""witch"" is a charged word in western culture, and centuries of misinformation have led people to have certain expectations. As a result, any movie about witches has a daunting task: In order to prevent viewers from being disappointed, the film must provide viewers with what they expect, regardless of how far from the truth it may stray.The unfortunate people who were actually charged with being ""witches"" in the medievel period were accused of, and confessed to, amazing things which defy common sense, let alone scientific and physical laws. Of course, most people WOULD confess to just about anything if, for example, a red hot piece of iron were being held against their body, over and over again. It is safe to say that no one ever really flew on a broom, or turned anyone into a toad, or had sex with Satan. Ever. The people who were accused of such things were usually women, usually older and without a husband, and often had some property which automatically defaulted to the Church upon their death. Often, they were ""healers"" who used their knowledge of herbs to cure sickness and ease discomforts, or midwives who helped deliver children at a time when there were few doctors available.Taken as a whole, ""The Witches of Eastwick"" is entertaining and to a great degree, an accurate reflection of human nature. Some other reviewers have claimed that the acting was poor, but I believe that they are confusing their own dislike of the content with poor acting. I found that the acting was completely believeable, and have in fact known many people who behaved exactly like some of the characters in the film. How much more realistic can acting be? And some of the poor reviews are a result of the viewer either not understanding exactly what they were seeing, or understanding, but refusing to accept the films message. This is a film, not to be viewed as a literal historical event, but at another level, with understanding that what one sees on screen is actually representative of something deeper. Those who enjoyed other movies with supernatural themes such as ""Practical Magic"" would probably enjoy ""The Witches of Eastwick"".",4,An entertaining exploration into the true nature of

However, it is a film that will probably appeal to worshipers of Cher or Nicholson, or some obscure Hollywood mutual admiration society.At this point, a used VHS edition of ""The Witches of Eastwick"" is selling for about $1.00 on amazon, but even that's too much to pay for this dog.",1,One of the Fifty Worst Films of All Time!,1102118400,"12 4, 2004",2004,1198,"['Utterly', 'unwatchable', 'nonsense.This', 'film', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'Bizzaro', 'world', 'split-level', 'home', 'built', 'clapboard', 'milk', 'cartons', 'used', 'furniture', 'crates', 'Nicholson', 'role', 'Shining', 'portraying', 'basket', 'case', 'routine', 'about', '99', '%', 'roles', 'Witches', 'Eastwick', 'based', 'book', 'John', 'Updike', 'Updike', 'originally', 'wanted', 'say', 'differences', 'sexes', 'upstaged', 'hammy', 'Nicholson', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'relegated', 'being', 'caterer', 'shooting', 'location.It', 'also', 'difficult', 'believe', 'talented', 'Cher', 'same', 'person', 'who', 'made', 'Moonstruck', 'such', 'great', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'anything', 'do', 'mess', 'Witches', 'Eastwick', 'bombed', 'box', 'office', 'word', 'mouth', 'killed', 'not', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'dredged', 'up', 'time', 'time', 'was', 'once', 'popular', 'was', ""n't"", 'However', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'appeal', 'worshipers', 'Cher', 'Nicholson', 'obscure', 'Hollywood', 'mutual', 'admiration', 'society.At', 'point', 'used', 'VHS', 'edition', 'Witches', 'Eastwick', 'selling', '1.00', 'amazon', 'even', 'too', 'much', 'pay', 'dog']",N/A

100245,A3IP0R4JOD4R5G,0790732262,the masked reviewer,"[10, 12]","That old Jack magic has us in his spell in the ultimate Nicholson part -- old Scratch himself. He is undisputably the star of ""The Witches of Eastwick,"" despite formidable competition from his unlikely coven of modern day Rhode Island witches played delightfully by Cher, Michelle Pfeiffer and Susan Sarandon.One dark night over Cheez Whiz and martinis, the three women lament the lack of good men, wishing idly for the ideal lover -- ""a dark prince, traveling under a curse, on a dark charger.""  They clink a toast to a thunderclap. And suddenly out of the wet New England woods, something wicked their way comes -- in a speeding black Mercedes with extra running lights and the power to leap potholes. Daryl Van Horne, cloven hoofs hidden under his Lakers high-tops, makes his entrance into quaint, colonial Eastwick. He's a supernatural cutup, equal parts blasphemy, brimstone and catnip.When John Updike wrote his risque' 1984 best seller, he was definetely dancing on the edge of antihereo in Van Horne. Screen writer Michael Cristofer compounds the chaos with a beguiling brew of satanic spoof, sexual bickering, monster mash and Gothic slapstick comedy. If Hawthorne were alive and well in the '80s and inclined to caffeine abuse, he might have penned this frantic genre-bender, with its uninhibited exploration of repression's fruits -- political and physical -- with Daryl as devil's advocate to the women's movement. The sly chauvinist is against liberation, unless it's sexual. But he is not above using feminist propaganda to flatter and seduce the trio who inadvertently summoned him. Naturally, they find him irresistible. (Each of them manless and sorely oppressed in Eastwick.)With its white steepled church and lawns more pristine than AstroTurf, it makes the perfect Puritan theme park. We fly down into this manicured doll town with its Halloween orange trees, aboard a cinematic broomstick, swept up in the fractured fantasy by director George Miller who directs this eccentric fairy tale with his customary flair and adolescent gusto. His proportions are outsized and the mood is demonic Disney. With a sky full of chubby, children's-book clouds and a dance number in an explosion of pink balloons, you think this is how the Devil would romance Mary Poppins -- provided Poppins would not be put off by cherry vomit.Nicholson hasn't frothed like this since he cut loose in ""The Shining."" His Daryl, unlike Devils of yore, arrives in sartorial disarray. He's a reactionary womanizer who makes man's men like Bruce Willis come off like closet quiche-eaters. Curiously, the allegedly independent women Daryl woos are easy catches, more willing even than Stepford Wives.Cher, is first to succumb, as widowed sculptor Alexandra Medford. All it takes, in fact, is a little empathy. Daryl, wriggling like a kitty, invites Alexandra to join him in his king-size bed in a manner that may not be repeated here. ""I appreciate your directness,"" says Alexandra. ""But I am sure you are the most unattractive man I've ever met ... You're not even interesting enough to make me sick."" ""So which do you want, the bottom or the top?"" asks the unflappable Daryl, who immediately mesmerizes her with a speech about macrame' and coffee makers.Pfeiffer, as a small-town journalist with a half-dozen kids and a husband who deserted her, can't wait to join the magical me'nage. ""I'd love to be a woman,"" whispers Daryl. ""Look what you can do with your bodies ... make babies, make milk to feed the babies."" We might gag at this ourselves, but Pfeiffer's Sukie Ridgemont is taken in, being inordinately proud of her fecundity. Sukie was the beginning of more substantial parts for Pfeiffer, who is exquisite and sweetly intent.But it's Sarandon who makes the greatest impression in her transition from retiring wallflower to ravishing vixen. As recently divorced cellist Jane Spofford, she fleshes out the cartoon role as a repressed redhead who gives herself to the Devil in a smoking, bow-stroking musical interlude. After a duet, the sheet music bursts into flames, the cello burns and the lovers are equally consumed. From then on, Jane gives up her glasses and takes to wearing little girls' socks with her high heels. And we all know what that signifies.But almost all are upstaged by the insanely underrated Veronica Cartwright, a former child star who plays the thirty-ish Felicia Gabriel, a prophetic pillar of the community who senses the Devil's presence, becoming ever more paranoid as the merriment progresses. It's a prissy part that's even harder to play sympathetically than Nicholson's, but Cartwright does so handily. She's terrific. Richard Jenkins is also a small marvel as her long-suffering husband.The battle between the sexes escalates and the fantasies get nasty as we near the frenzied finale that finds Van Horne, covered in chicken feathers and pink slime, demanding of a congregation of Eastwick Christians if ""God knew what he was doing when he created woman? You don't think God makes mistakes?""Some purists will say that the film has very little to do with Updike's original novel, and they would be right. (The script was rewritten by award-winning playwright Cristopher on a daily basis.) But all that is small potatos when one views the final product. With outstanding performances, amazing art direction and cinematography, the film holds up as fun, diverting entertainment with a standout over-the-top Nicholson (in a role he was born to play!) There is also a lush score by John WIlliams that captures with amazing dexterity, both the witchy playfulness of it's subject and just the right feel of a small New England town.This film was a big hit in theaters during the summer of 1987 and deserves to be seen again and again. One can only hope that Warner Brothers has plans to honor THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK with a well deserved 2 disc special edition with a magnificent pristine print and enough bonus extras to equal the pull-out-all-the-stops finale of the film.An amazing movie.",5,A CAULDRON FULL OF FUN,1115337600,"05 6, 2005",2005,6014,"['old', 'Jack', 'magic', 'spell', 'ultimate', 'Nicholson', 'part', 'old',
