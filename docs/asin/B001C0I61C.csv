1173587,A3M4C2VDWYJSSA,B001C0I61C,Compusurge,"[8, 8]","Talk about tween TV, my daughter is going to be thrilled when I tell her this series, one of her absolute favorites, is coming to DVD. For a long time she was unaware of this show, but about 3 months ago she came home from school chattering about it. As a parent I needed to watch through an episode or two first. Finding it totally ok for her, she began watching it as regularly as she has watched any of the shows for her age group (turning 9 shortly). I guess it's goodbye iCarly and hello Derek in this here household.Blended family (sort of a modern twist on my generation's Brady Bunch), the story is really not about Derek, but about his sister and the entire family who has to live 'life with Derek'.Good family fun. It's already on ""the list"" as a holiday gift. And, when I found it it comes with a poster, I intellegently  left that out of our conversation. She's going to be totally surprised by that little 'extra' indeed.",5,my daughter will be thrilled,1217808000,"08 4, 2008",2008,934,"['Talk', 'tween', 'TV', 'daughter', 'going', 'be', 'thrilled', 'when', 'tell', 'series', 'one', 'absolute', 'favorites', 'coming', 'DVD', 'long', 'time', 'was', 'unaware', 'show', '3', 'months', 'came', 'home', 'school', 'chattering', 'parent', 'needed', 'watch', 'episode', 'two', 'first', 'Finding', 'totally', 'ok', 'began', 'watching', 'as', 'regularly', 'watched', 'shows', 'age', 'group', 'turning', '9', 'shortly', 'guess', 'goodbye', 'iCarly', 'hello', 'Derek', 'here', 'household.Blended', 'family', 'sort', 'modern', 'twist', 'generation', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'story', 'really', 'not', 'Derek', 'sister', 'entire', 'family', 'who', 'live', ""'life"", ""Derek'.Good"", 'family', 'fun', 'already', 'list', 'holiday', 'gift', 'when', 'found', 'poster', 'intellegently', 'left', 'conversation', 'going', 'be', 'totally', 'surprised', 'little', ""'extra"", 'indeed']",Life with Derek: Season 1
1173588,A1RHXIZOOR6922,B001C0I61C,"David Lam ""Dark Shadow""","[0, 1]","Life with Derek is about two families, the Venturi's & the McDonald's, living together by parental marriage in the same house & accepting each other for who they are. The Alpha dogs of the household are Derek Venturi & Casey McDonald. The Omega dogs of the household are Edwin Venturi & Lizzie McDonald. The little princess is Marti Venturi. The parents of the pack are George Venturi & Nora McDonald. This is one of the better reality shows on Family Channel. This reality show actually mirrors the daily lifestyles & hardships that joined families face & overcome in North America. What makes this TV series so great is how they portray the power of family unity & defending each other from external tensions despite their inter-personal annoyances between family members.The acting & performance of the actors & actresses is top notch. Storyline centres around the daily lifestyles of the characters from the household setting to a high school setting. The plot is well paced & well directed with very little dull moments. The dialogue of this reality series is well done since it mirrors your typical family sibling to family sibling, friend to friend, & boyfriend to girlfriend conversations. The genre is comedy but drama can also be tied into this popular TV series.I recommend this TV series.Thanks.",5,One of Family Channel's better reality TV shows!,1287100800,"10 15, 2010",2010,1307,"['Life', 'Derek', 'two', 'families', 'Venturi', 'McDonald', 'living', 'together', 'parental', 'marriage', 'same', 'house', 'accepting', 'other', 'who', 'are', 'Alpha', 'dogs', 'household', 'are', 'Derek', 'Venturi', 'Casey', 'McDonald', 'Omega', 'dogs', 'household', 'are', 'Edwin', 'Venturi', 'Lizzie', 'McDonald', 'little', 'princess', 'Marti', 'Venturi', 'parents', 'pack', 'are', 'George', 'Venturi', 'Nora', 'McDonald', 'one', 'better', 'reality', 'shows', 'Family', 'Channel', 'reality', 'show', 'actually', 'mirrors', 'daily', 'lifestyles', 'hardships', 'joined', 'families', 'face', 'overcome', 'North', 'America', 'What', 'TV', 'series', 'so', 'great', 'how', 'portray', 'power', 'family', 'unity', 'defending', 'other', 'external', 'tensions', 'inter-personal', 'annoyances', 'family', 'members.The', 'acting', 'performance', 'actors', 'actresses', 'top', 'notch', 'Storyline', 'centres', 'daily', 'lifestyles', 'characters', 'household', 'setting', 'high', 'school', 'setting', 'plot', 'well', 'paced', 'well', 'directed', 'very', 'little', 'dull', 'moments', 'dialogue', 'reality', 'series', 'well', 'done', 'typical', 'family', 'sibling', 'family', 'sibling', 'friend', 'friend', 'boyfriend', 'girlfriend', 'conversations', 'genre', 'comedy', 'drama', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'tied', 'popular', 'TV', 'series.I', 'recommend', 'TV', 'series.Thanks']",Life with Derek: Season 1
1173589,A21Z2EC8Y2GO65,B001C0I61C,D. Johnson,"[7, 7]",I watched this first last summer because my 13-year-old sister liked it. I immediatley was hooked on the show. I'm 21 and I thought it was great. It reminds me a lot of when I was in high school. The show to me is kind of like Lizzie McGuire meets the Brady Bunch.  The cut-aways in the show are a lot like in Lizzie McGuire but the story of the family is a lot like Brady Bunch. I thought it'd be about Derek but it's more about Cassie's life (with Derek). It's for a little more mature children because of some of the things in the show. It's very funny and Ashley Leggat is really hot!,5,Great show not just for teens.,1229731200,"12 20, 2008",2008,588,"['watched', 'first', 'last', 'summer', '13-year-old', 'sister', 'liked', 'immediatley', 'was', 'hooked', 'show', ""'m"", '21', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'lot', 'when', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'show', 'kind', 'Lizzie', 'McGuire', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'cut-aways', 'show', 'are', 'lot', 'Lizzie', 'McGuire', 'story', 'family', 'lot', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'thought', ""'d"", 'be', 'Derek', 'more', 'Cassie', 'life', 'Derek', 'little', 'more', 'mature', 'children', 'things', 'show', 'very', 'funny', 'Ashley', 'Leggat', 'really', 'hot']",Life with Derek: Season 1
