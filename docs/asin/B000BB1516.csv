It's not the same, is it.), so my wife and I came into the Tomorrow People with low expectations. A lot of the acting is weak, many scenes have obvious fluffed dialog, the effects are very British (Dr. Who), and the stories seem to have an overly simplified conclusion. Despite all of this it has been enjoyable, and for us has faired better than other shows we've tried to watch. Some of the stories were fairly complex for a kids show (far more so than any US shows), especially in later seasons when the stories get heavier and darker.I don't know how one would feel watching this for the first time, but then again I don't know why someone would seek this out except from a nostalgic stand point.Expect nothing and you'll never be disappointed.",4,Going home again.,1212624000,"06 5, 2008",2008,884,"['Wanting', 'watch', 'show', 'enjoyed', 'childhood', 'adult', 'can', 'often', 'lead', 'great', 'disappointment', 'try', 'watching', 'evening', 'news', 'not', 'same', 'wife', 'came', 'Tomorrow', 'People', 'low', 'expectations', 'lot', 'acting', 'weak', 'many', 'scenes', 'have', 'obvious', 'fluffed', 'dialog', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'British', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'stories', 'seem', 'have', 'overly', 'simplified', 'conclusion', 'been', 'enjoyable', 'faired', 'better', 'other', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'watch', 'stories', 'were', 'fairly', 'complex', 'kids', 'show', 'far', 'more', 'so', 'US', 'shows', 'especially', 'later', 'seasons', 'when', 'stories', 'get', 'heavier', 'darker.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'one', 'would', 'feel', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'then', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'someone', 'would', 'seek', 'out', 'nostalgic', 'stand', 'point.Expect', 'nothing', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'disappointed']",The Tomorrow People: Set 2
