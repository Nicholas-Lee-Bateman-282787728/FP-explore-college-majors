967793,A60C7WQTG5R52,B000E4I2BQ,a viewpoint,"[5, 5]","This is the greatest animal documentary movie since Born Free.  March of the Penguins was a huge hit, but this deserves more acclaim.  While the penguin documentary was truly amazing and enlightening, this is equally so, with the added advantage of being about wolves, which most of us who love dogs can more easily relate to.  This is a very well told story of how a man got very close to the wolves was practically accepted as a member of the pack.  There is a bit of a love story element in how a man who lives in the wild studying wolves met and fell in love with a woman who was happy to meet him on his terms and became a part of his dream.This documentary reveals some very interesting aspects of wolf behavior.  For instance, when new young wolves are introduced to a small pack of older, larger adults, you might expect the youngsters to be accepted only after they're intimidated and put in their place in the pecking order.  And yet, one of the youngsters is accepted as the alpha wolf (the leader of the pack) without a fight or even any growling, etc.  It's a mystery what cues the wolves picked up on and how the larger, older alpha male  peacefully accepted that he had met his younger smaller superior.Join the Dutchers as they lead you on a heartwarming adventure that you'll never forget.",5,A Spectacular Documentary,1165449600,"12 7, 2006",2006,1306,"['greatest', 'animal', 'documentary', 'movie', 'Born', 'Free', 'March', 'Penguins', 'was', 'huge', 'hit', 'more', 'acclaim', 'penguin', 'documentary', 'was', 'truly', 'amazing', 'enlightening', 'equally', 'so', 'added', 'advantage', 'being', 'wolves', 'most', 'who', 'love', 'dogs', 'can', 'more', 'easily', 'relate', 'very', 'well', 'told', 'story', 'how', 'man', 'got', 'very', 'close', 'wolves', 'was', 'practically', 'accepted', 'member', 'pack', 'bit', 'love', 'story', 'element', 'how', 'man', 'who', 'wild', 'studying', 'wolves', 'met', 'fell', 'love', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'happy', 'meet', 'terms', 'became', 'part', 'dream.This', 'documentary', 'reveals', 'very', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'wolf', 'behavior', 'instance', 'when', 'new', 'young', 'wolves', 'are', 'introduced', 'small', 'pack', 'older', 'larger', 'adults', 'might', 'expect', 'youngsters', 'be', 'accepted', 'only', ""'re"", 'intimidated', 'put', 'place', 'pecking', 'order', 'yet', 'one', 'youngsters', 'accepted', 'alpha', 'wolf', 'leader', 'pack', 'fight', 'even', 'growling', 'etc', 'mystery', 'wolves', 'picked', 'up', 'how', 'larger', 'older', 'alpha', 'male', 'peacefully', 'accepted', 'had', 'met', 'younger', 'smaller', 'superior.Join', 'Dutchers', 'lead', 'heartwarming', 'adventure', ""'ll"", 'never', 'forget']",N/A

I am sending it to my granddaughter for Christmas, as she is a  protector of Wildlife, and wants to be a biologist, or a veterinarian.  She already has many animals, and even though the wolf is a  predator, he has his own habitat and life that God ordained.  In this video it shows the love and care of the alpha wolf parents they have for the pups.  Actually the pups are cared for and loved by all the pack. They are a family that sticks together.  Each has his place to make up the pack.  And to see the Dutcher's living with the wolves, even though they are not wild, as they raise them from pups, it is wonderful to see the interaction of the wolves with them.  A wonderful movie, one I like to look at often.  I hope the wolves and their habitat are protected for years to come. But today,  It makes me sad to see the lawful killing of wolves now, as wolves only kill for food.  Man is a much great predator than the wolf as he kills not only for food but for sport.  He is certainly cruel.  I believe everyone will benefit by watching this film,, and respect the wolf as God as created him.",5,An absolutely wonderful movie.,1386115200,"12 4, 2013",2013,1126,"['wonderful', 'video', 'am', 'sending', 'granddaughter', 'Christmas', 'protector', 'Wildlife', 'be', 'biologist', 'veterinarian', 'already', 'many', 'animals', 'even', 'wolf', 'predator', 'own', 'habitat', 'life', 'God', 'ordained', 'video', 'love', 'care', 'alpha', 'wolf', 'parents', 'have', 'pups', 'Actually', 'pups', 'are', 'cared', 'loved', 'pack', 'are', 'family', 'together', 'place', 'make', 'up', 'pack', 'see', 'Dutcher', 'living', 'wolves', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'wild', 'raise', 'pups', 'wonderful', 'see', 'interaction', 'wolves', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'one', 'like', 'look', 'often', 'hope', 'wolves', 'habitat', 'are', 'protected', 'years', 'come', 'today', 'sad', 'see', 'lawful', 'killing', 'wolves', 'now', 'wolves', 'only', 'kill', 'food', 'Man', 'much', 'great', 'predator', 'wolf', 'not', 'only', 'food', 'sport', 'certainly', 'cruel', 'believe', 'everyone', 'will', 'benefit', 'watching', 'film', 'respect', 'wolf', 'as', 'God', 'created']",N/A

967796,A2KKQ2K4O2GY2Y,B000E4I2BQ,Sonja,"[12, 15]","From reading the product description and the other reviews, I thought this was a documentary about wild wolves and that it gave insight into the behavior and lives of wild wolves.  But it's really not that.  Dutcher starts with two wild wolves that he takes from Canada to his... sanctuary?  study space?  big backyard?  But soon decides that these wolves will not work for his purposes, of which I'm not really sure what they are.  He wants to have a significant relationship with the wolves, I guess, and truly wild wolves aren't interested in that.  So he adopts infant wolf pups and raises them himself by bottle feeding them.  When they are about 16 weeks old, he put them in his... backyard?  And then he films them a lot?So let's be clear:  all the wolves in this documentary (with the exception of the first two from Canada, which he gets rid of) have been raised by Dutcher.  They are in some sort of fenced in enclosure (it's a very large area - but still fenced in).  They never have to hunt for food, as the Dutchers provide them with carcasses.  There are no competing wolf packs.These wolves are not wild, in the true sense of the word.  I have very little doubt that if that fence wasn't keeping them in contact with the Dutchers that they would have high tailed it out of there.  But they couldn't, so the Dutchers got to film them a lot and develop a relationship with them.All that being said, it's an interesting documentary, and I enjoyed it, which is why I'm giving it three stars.  Just know what you're getting yourself into.  If you want to see a documentary about wild wolves, there are at least two about the wolves at Yellowstone (""Wolves: A Legend Returns to Yellowstone"" and ""Wolves: IMAX"").",3,not about wild/independent wolves,1294099200,"01 4, 2011",2011,1720,"['reading', 'product', 'description', 'other', 'reviews', 'thought', 'was', 'documentary', 'wild', 'wolves', 'gave', 'insight', 'behavior', 'lives', 'wild', 'wolves', 'really', 'not', 'Dutcher', 'two', 'wild', 'wolves', 'Canada', 'sanctuary', 'study', 'space', 'big', 'backyard', 'soon', 'decides', 'wolves', 'will', 'not', 'work', 'purposes', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'are', 'have', 'significant', 'relationship', 'wolves', 'guess', 'truly', 'wild', 'wolves', 'are', ""n't"", 'interested', 'So', 'infant', 'wolf', 'pups', 'bottle', 'feeding', 'When', 'are', '16', 'weeks', 'old', 'put', 'backyard', 'then', 'lot', 'So', 'let', 'be', 'clear', 'wolves', 'documentary', 'exception', 'first', 'two', 'Canada', 'rid', 'have', 'been', 'raised', 'Dutcher', 'are', 'sort', 'fenced', 'enclosure', 'very', 'large', 'area', 'still', 'fenced', 'never', 'have', 'hunt', 'food', 'Dutchers', 'provide', 'carcasses', 'are', 'competing', 'wolf', 'packs.These', 'wolves', 'are', 'not', 'wild', 'true', 'sense', 'word', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'doubt', 'fence', 'was', ""n't"", 'keeping', 'contact', 'Dutchers', 'would', 'have', 'high', 'tailed', 'could', ""n't"", 'Dutchers', 'got', 'film', 'lot', 'develop', 'relationship', 'them.All', 'being', 'said', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'enjoyed', 'why', ""'m"", 'giving', 'three', 'stars', 'Just', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'want', 'see', 'documentary', 'wild', 'wolves', 'are', 'least', 'two', 'wolves', 'Yellowstone', 'Legend', 'Returns', 'Yellowstone', 'Wolves', 'IMAX']",N/A
