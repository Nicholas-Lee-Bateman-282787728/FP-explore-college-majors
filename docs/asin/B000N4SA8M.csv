1053427,A1Y9V2TACK0BTL,B000N4SA8M,B. Browne,"[0, 0]","I have run into few people who are familiar with this vastly under-appreciated television series, but clearly those who have seen it have recognized its unique genius. Once the viewer gets accustomed to actors wearing dinosaur costumes, the facial movements of which are operated remotely by skilled puppeteers, it becomes apparent that this is a brilliant version of a standard sit-com format: somewhat buffoonish, long-suffering everyman father (Earl), somewhat more astute wife/mother (Fran), rebellious teenage Son (Robbie),clueless, materialistic daughter (Charlene) and somewhat malevolent but entertaining Baby. The stunning originality of this series rests on three very strong foundations: the writers, who have built in some of the wittiest social, cultural and political satire ever seen in a TV series; the puppeteers (Volume I includes an excellent feature explaining how it's all done), whose astounding abilities are evident in the astonishing variety of facial expressions they are able to give the dino-characters; and the actors who have to navigate the sets in cumbersome costumes, often without being able to see what they are doing. The astounding synchronization of movement, expression and dialogue make this an unforgettable viewing experience. I have watched few television shows that caused me to laugh aloud regularly - this one never fails. There are numerous priceless moments, as in Season  3's disc two episode ""Dirty Dancin', wherein at one point Earl brags to Fran about his mating abilities - the look on Fran's face is worth the price of the whole series - I have watched it again and again. It is a testament to the high art of the puppeteers. My only regret about this series is that it ran only four seasons.

Bragg ""--Braggeroni""","[0, 0]","I bought this pack along with the Season 1 and 2 pack, so I was able to compare each season and each DVD back-to-back.The case is different in that this one does not have the outer cardboard case.  However, the menu inside is the same, and the disc storing is the same.  As I said in my other review, my only issue here was with how the discs were secured in the case.  They tend to not stay put much; this isn't an issue for me as I put my DVDs in soft-shell cases and store the original casing in a big box, but it was a concern during the shipment.The discs still arrived in perfect condition, and the migration from TV to DVD format was perfect.The content itself is great.  Dinosaurs continues to address some major, real problems (and occassionally non-existent ones) with good delivery.  These season also contain the faux documentary episodes, which I loathed to no end, but did help to fill in the blank spots in the writers' heads.The series finale is effective in drawing-in even the adult viewers with the final moments of the episode, and teach us about the dilemma of short-sighted society:""Everyone's buying...

1053437,A3JY82VJGNUIKE,B000N4SA8M,"Garan Grey ""Garan Grey""","[8, 8]","In all the product info for Season 3/4 of DINOSAURS, including Disney's press releases and their own website, the music video ""I'm the Baby Gotta Love Me"" is listed as a special added feature... Try to find it. On the actual packaging for the disc, it refers to a featurette called ""I'm the Baby, Gotta Love Me"" which is a nice bit about the Baby character, but the music video is not included...I made a call to Disney's DVD department. I was put on hold for a while and then told: ""the music video was announced in early publicity as being under consideration as a possible extra, but it was decided to include the featurette instead of the music video."" I pointed out that the music video is clearly mentioned on Disney's own website. Their response: ""If you'd like a refund or exchange....""Put on Disc 1 and play an episode called ""Little Boy Boo."" At the end of the episode is... the music video of Baby Sinclair singing ""I'm the Baby."" It's a catchy song and the visuals are a lot of fun. This is up to the Henson creative team's usual high standards. However, you can't say the same for the Disney DVD division. There is no chapter stop for the musc video. You have to scan back from the end credits to find it ..So obviously, there is confusion and miscommunication within Disney's DVD marketing department. They announced the Baby's Music Video as a feature but were quite confused about where it was... or whether it was there at all.I think the Jim Henson Company's work on DINOSAURS is absolutely brilliant. Smart. clever, thoughtful, great looking and hilarious. Incredibly rich with layers of clever details, DINOSAURS is entertaining on more than one level. The more you watch it, the more you discover. I highly recommend the series itself as top-notch entertainment. I still howl with laughter at the hysterical EXORCIST parody (""The Power of Rice Compels You!"") Robby's dalliance in an alternate lifestyle, (to Earl's chagrin - a Vegetarian ""Give Peas A Chance"") Charlene's falsie tail, The miniseries parody ""Nuts To War,"" TV Commentator Howard Handupme, taking on their own critics in a self-referential bit about a TV show they see, (about which Earl says it's clever and Mom says ""it's just puppets!"") and the episode about inappropriate language learned on TV, where the baby says ""Smoo!""  Rarely do you get this much Smart and Funny in the same place with great production values.Like the Walt Disney company used to, The Jim Henson Company has a reputation for thoughtful attention to detail. The Henson creations deserve better handling than Disney is giving, but then the same could be said of the vintage Disney movie catalog. Disney doesn't do the work justice. I can only hope Disney gets its ""smoo"" together before they ""flark"" up another good creation. ; )Update: interestingly, since I posted this, (like a couple years later) the product description here on Amazon has now been reworked to tell where the Baby's music video is.

Anyway, it seems ""Changing Nature"" was clearly meant to be a SERIES finale. It is one of the most touching you will see, and truly a revelation (I didn't catch it upon it's initial airing).We also have a few episodes that were never aired by ABC (as a special treat), one of them a funny parody of Barney the Dinosaur.

1053445,A10G4BPT5MGBHY,B000N4SA8M,Julie Neal,"[12, 17]","Like stuffing spinach in a candy bar, ""Dinosaurs"" sneaks political and social issues into a kid-friendly sitcom. Though its characters are cartoonish dinosaurs who dress, act and speak just like typical early-'90s sitcom stars, the show often focuses on social issues like the environment, race, religion, television and the role of women. The stories center on the Sinclair family -- blue-collar dad Earl, sensible mom Fran, rebellious son Robbie, shopoholic daughter Charlene, smart-aleck infant Baby and dimwitted neighbor Roy. Set 60 million years ago, ""Dinosaurs"" has lots of good gags. The calendars run backward, though no one questions what they are counting down to. When humans appear, the dinosaurs can never tell the males from the females.But it's not for everyone. The pacing can drag, not everyone will agree with the show's progressive point of view and, unlike the puppet faces in other Henson Co. projects, these hard-plastic versions make it tough to care about the characters. Still, many kids will love the kooky vibe, and the show does have its moments. When Earl gets into a fist-fight with kid's TV character Georgie the Hippo (a veil-thin version of Barney the Dinosaur), Roy entertains the stunned onlookers -- all children -- with an impromptu version of the 1970s Commodores hit, ""Brick House.""If you buy this set, the easiest way to enjoy it is to cherry-pick the episodes you watch. The better ones include:""BABY TALK"" (about profanity)""NETWORK GENIUS"" (TV programming)""THE SON ALSO RISES"" (role reversal)""THE GREATEST STORY EVER SOLD"" (religion)""GETTING TO KNOW YOU"" (cultural diversity)""HONEY I MISS THE KIDS"" (working moms)""EARL DON'T BE A HERO"" (commercialism)""VARIATIONS ON A THEME PARK"" (Disney theme parks)""GEORGIE MUST DIE"" (Barney the dinosaur)""CHANGING NATURE"" (extinction)Bonus features include an insightful audio commentary (for the episode ""Nature Calls""); a 9-minute discussion of the show's political messages and a 6-minute short on the design and personality of Baby (Kevin Clash, who also portrays Elmo on ""Sesame Street"").By the way, if you're headed to Walt Disney World you can see some of the show's props in person. They're in the walk-through Prop Storage Room of the Backlot Tour at Disney's Hollywood Studios.

The family of five combines reality and fantasy, cutting through false assumptions and pitting reality against stupidity.  It deals with everything from anti-union employers to Robby's fling with steroids and teenage insecurity about 'size' issues reduced to a discussion of the daughter's tail. Most episodes have several plot lines working together.
