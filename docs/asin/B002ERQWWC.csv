The great thing about it was that it came with a paper fold out map, which went along with the DVD, so in that way, it was interactive, she could follow what the dog (and other) animals were doing, and what letter they were searching for. This set does not contain the maps, but at this low price for all of them, they will still teach your kids / toddlers some great lessons.",4,Learning DVD,1255478400,"10 14, 2009",2009,480,"['purchased', 'one', 'store', 'daughter', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'great', 'thing', 'was', 'came', 'paper', 'fold', 'out', 'map', 'went', 'DVD', 'so', 'way', 'was', 'interactive', 'could', 'follow', 'what', 'dog', 'other', 'animals', 'were', 'doing', 'what', 'letter', 'were', 'searching', 'set', 'not', 'contain', 'maps', 'low', 'price', 'will', 'still', 'teach', 'kids', '/', 'toddlers', 'great', 'lessons']",WordWorld: Lots of Letters
