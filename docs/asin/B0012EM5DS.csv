Though this was more of a drama, nobody seemed to realize that Ted Danson is the one who made that popular, way back in 1998 as Dr. John Becker.""Becker"" is one of the funniest shows ever to hit TV, but sadly some casting changes and other behind-the-scenes squabbling brought the show to a slow demise after about six seasons. Ted Danson gives some of his best work here. If you think the rants of Dr. Cox on ""Scrubs"" are funny, just wait until Becker storms into his office ranting about the bums on the street, the city health department, the justice system, humanity in general or any one the upteen-million things that seem to make him angry.The true heart of this show is it's sheer originality and unique characters - Becker's dim-witted female assistant, Linda, could have been a walking cliche were she portrayed by a busty blond, instead she's portrayed by the raven-haired Shawnee Smith (of ""Saw"" fame) with perfect comedic timing; Margaret is Dr. Becker's nurse, a heavy-set Bible-thumping black woman who is the perfect opposite of Becker's in-your-face sarcasm, anger and rants against God and religion; then there's Jake, Becker's blind best friend who, although he becomes the butt of many jokes, holds his own as one of the show's leading men; there's Reggie, the middle-aged ex-model turned diner owner who can't get a date despite her drop-dead gorgeous looks; and Bob, the fast talking nitwit who annoys everyone yet manages to remain an appealing part of the show. Other characters constantly move in and out of the show with many famous stars making guest appearances.Naturally ""Becker"" falls prey to many common sitcom gags and it's formula never really changes, which makes it a bit redundant after a while.

But why did they have to screw up for the first season?This DVD disables the instant replay button on my player. If I miss a line, it's a pain to rewind to play over again.

Becker's character of someone who's heavily opinionated & isn't afraid to say what's on his mind is just gold. Eventhough that's the side that's present more than any other, you see other sides of him as well throughout the series as well showing that he does care about the people around him & his heart is in the right place where it matters (Pilot episode).  With other characters like Becker's best friend & blind newsstand owner Jake, supermodel to crappy cafe owner Reggie, more beauty than brains Linda, and Margret being the only one who's somewhat normal...just the right formula.
