The documentary shows true to life struggles of a young farm family trying to make it through rough times.  The first time I watched this was on PBS when I was first married.  I just purchased the dvd after something made me remember how much the story touched me.  Watching it as a wife with plenty of life/marriage experiences I felt that I viewed the story from a different perspective.

Telling the story of a financially and maritally struggling Midwestern farm couple and their three young daughters, The Farmer's Wife begins as an exploration of the uphill battle America's farmers are facing in today's world, but it progressively, to the surprise of viewers and filmmakers alike, becomes much more. The Farmer's Wife is the story of good, hard-working people, of a marriage in crisis, of endurance, of hardships faced, and of the emotional highs and lows of some remarkable human beings living through changes to all they've previously known and held dear. It is an intimate portrait of Midwestern family farmers whose continued presence in the United States is endangered by our modern economy. It is a gripping insight into the private side of other peoples' existence that most of us never see. The Buschkoetter family were brave for having done this project a decade ago, and while I know in hindsight ""what came next"" the portion of their lives during the two years captured on film remains a touching testament to an admirable and extraordinary couple.",5,"A Pioneer Of  ""Reality Broadcasting"" And The Telling Of A Remarkable Story",1158364800,"09 16, 2006",2006,1297,"['first', 'saw', 'film', 'PBS', 'back', 'late-1990', 'current', 'onslaught', 'reality', 'TV', 'had', 'begun', 'recall', 'made', 'profoundly', 'interested', 'lives', 'family', 'five', 'endured', 'Telling', 'story', 'financially', 'maritally', 'struggling', 'Midwestern', 'farm', 'couple', 'three', 'young', 'daughters', 'Farmer', 'Wife', 'exploration', 'uphill', 'battle', 'America', 'farmers', 'are', 'facing', 'today', 'world', 'progressively', 'surprise', 'viewers', 'filmmakers', 'alike', 'becomes', 'much', 'more', 'Farmer', 'Wife', 'story', 'good', 'hard-working', 'people', 'marriage', 'crisis', 'endurance', 'hardships', 'faced', 'emotional', 'highs', 'lows', 'remarkable', 'human', 'beings', 'living', 'changes', ""'ve"", 'previously', 'known', 'held', 'dear', 'intimate', 'portrait', 'Midwestern', 'family', 'farmers', 'continued', 'presence', 'United', 'States', 'endangered', 'modern', 'economy', 'gripping', 'insight', 'private', 'side', 'other', 'peoples', 'existence', 'most', 'never', 'see', 'Buschkoetter', 'family', 'were', 'brave', 'having', 'done', 'project', 'decade', 'ago', 'know', 'hindsight', 'what', 'came', 'next', 'portion', 'lives', 'two', 'years', 'captured', 'film', 'touching', 'testament', 'admirable', 'extraordinary', 'couple']",N/A

959880,A1VOPP2OFITP7D,B000CPHABK,June Bug,"[0, 0]","The Buschkoetter family allowed a documentary crew into their home to follow them day and night for 3 years.  Their struggles, transparency and moral codes are openly revealed in this dramatic documentary.  One can only feel compassion, as they face the challenges of the elements, their equipment, their interfering family and commodity prices to keep their small farm going.Juanita Buschkoetter must wrest the reins of the financial morass that her husband doesn't have the time or depth of knowledge to fix.  This creates insecurity and rivalry initially between the couple as well as increased pressure from their extended family and their community.Juanita's family doesn't think she should stay.  They think Darryl is not worthy of her (at times the audience sees their point) and that she has talents beyond cleaning houses and being a farmer's wife.  Juanita manages to work, be a mother of three young girls (3-8 y.o.), take care of their complicated finances and get an AA degree with honors during this period.  Darryl evolves as well and his changes are increasing positive.One can only admire this couple for facing so many obstacles with the tenacity and courage they display and their unwillingness not to throw in the towel; when nothing seems to be improving after they restructure their debt.Having lived all over the country, I can say that they embody the strength of spirit common in the mid-western community better than many today.  Their courage to share their story is quite unusual as most farmers are very independent, stoic individuals, who think that admitting any struggle is a sign of weak moral character.One realizes that family farmer's still remain the unsung heroes of America.I hope that one day there will be a follow-up to their story.",5,"Where there is life, there is hope!",1384560000,"11 16, 2013",2013,1774,"['Buschkoetter', 'family', 'allowed', 'documentary', 'crew', 'home', 'follow', 'day', 'night', '3', 'years', 'struggles', 'transparency', 'moral', 'codes', 'are', 'openly', 'revealed', 'dramatic', 'documentary', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'feel', 'compassion', 'face', 'challenges', 'elements', 'equipment', 'interfering', 'family', 'commodity', 'prices', 'keep', 'small', 'farm', 'going.Juanita', 'Buschkoetter', 'must', 'wrest', 'reins', 'financial', 'morass', 'husband', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'depth', 'knowledge', 'fix', 'insecurity', 'rivalry', 'initially', 'couple', 'as', 'well', 'increased', 'pressure', 'extended', 'family', 'community.Juanita', 'family', ""n't"", 'think', 'should', 'stay', 'think', 'Darryl', 'not', 'worthy', 'times', 'audience', 'point', 'talents', 'cleaning', 'houses', 'being', 'farmer', 'wife', 'Juanita', 'work', 'be', 'mother', 'three', 'young', 'girls', '3-8', 'y.o', 'take', 'care', 'complicated', 'finances', 'get', 'AA', 'degree', 'honors', 'period', 'Darryl', 'as', 'well', 'changes', 'are', 'increasing', 'positive.One', 'can', 'only', 'admire', 'couple', 'facing', 'so', 'many', 'obstacles', 'tenacity', 'courage', 'display', 'unwillingness', 'not', 'throw', 'towel', 'when', 'nothing', 'be', 'improving', 'restructure', 'debt.Having', 'lived', 'country', 'can', 'say', 'embody', 'strength', 'spirit', 'common', 'mid-western', 'community', 'better', 'many', 'today', 'courage', 'share', 'story', 'quite', 'unusual', 'most', 'farmers', 'are', 'very', 'independent', 'stoic', 'individuals', 'who', 'think', 'admitting', 'struggle', 'sign', 'weak', 'moral', 'character.One', 'family', 'farmer', 'still', 'remain', 'unsung', 'heroes', 'America.I', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'will', 'be', 'follow-up', 'story']",N/A

Corn ""reviewer""","[25, 27]","If anyone ever wondered what the farming life is like, this documentary reveals how very difficult it can be to survive on a relatively small farm - in today's modern world of high tech farming. It is a gritty, backbreakingly hard life much of the time, waking up at dawn and falling into bed exhausted when all the chores are finally done and dinner has been eaten.The couple shown in this documentary hold very little back as their marriage is pushed to the brink by the stress of making ends meet, raise a family and just get by. I first saw it back in 1996 and am delighted to be able to purchase it (finally) on DVD.But be forewarned- this is not an easy film to watch, although it is an honest one. In unflinching detail, the grim reality of trying to ""make it"" as a farmer is portrayed. There isn't an ounce of romanticism here, no attempt to portray farm life as an idyllic retreat from city life, especially given the ending of this film.What DOES come across is the commitment to the land that those on family farms struggle to maintain, doggedly determined to try and hang on to their legacy.I wonder what happened to the couple in this film and hope the DVD provides some extra detail about that. Even if it does not, the film is worth watching because we should ALL be asking ourselves why small farms are being nearly impossible to find these days. This film answers some of those questions.",5,Incredible and heartbreaking!,1136505600,"01 6, 2006",2006,1405,"['anyone', 'ever', 'wondered', 'what', 'farming', 'life', 'documentary', 'how', 'very', 'difficult', 'can', 'be', 'survive', 'relatively', 'small', 'farm', 'today', 'modern', 'world', 'high', 'tech', 'farming', 'gritty', 'backbreakingly', 'hard', 'life', 'much', 'time', 'waking', 'up', 'dawn', 'falling', 'bed', 'exhausted', 'when', 'chores', 'are', 'finally', 'done', 'dinner', 'been', 'eaten.The', 'couple', 'shown', 'documentary', 'hold', 'very', 'little', 'back', 'marriage', 'pushed', 'brink', 'stress', 'making', 'ends', 'meet', 'raise', 'family', 'just', 'get', 'first', 'saw', 'back', '1996', 'am', 'delighted', 'be', 'able', 'purchase', 'finally', 'DVD.But', 'be', 'forewarned-', 'not', 'easy', 'film', 'watch', 'honest', 'one', 'unflinching', 'detail', 'grim', 'reality', 'trying', 'make', 'farmer', 'portrayed', ""n't"", 'ounce', 'romanticism', 'here', 'attempt', 'portray', 'farm', 'life', 'idyllic', 'retreat', 'city', 'life', 'especially', 'given', 'ending', 'film.What', 'come', 'across', 'commitment', 'land', 'family', 'farms', 'struggle', 'maintain', 'doggedly', 'determined', 'try', 'hang', 'legacy.I', 'wonder', 'what', 'happened', 'couple', 'film', 'hope', 'DVD', 'extra', 'detail', 'Even', 'not', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'should', 'ALL', 'be', 'asking', 'why', 'small', 'farms', 'are', 'being', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'find', 'days', 'film', 'questions']",N/A

For instance: her father asks ""what does a 16yo have in common with a 22yo""? I believe that Juanita was looking for a father figure in Darrell; her parents divorced and subconsciously I think she was looking for a 'replacement father' in him, ( ""when we were first married I did everything for her"" quotes Darrell). My 12 yo daughter watched this in shock when she heard Darrell wanted Juanita to drop out of HIGH SCHOOL, give up vet school and quit college because of jealousy.I think this is a strong feminist film of a women who finds her voice and threatens the male authority figures in her life ( her husband and father in law).
