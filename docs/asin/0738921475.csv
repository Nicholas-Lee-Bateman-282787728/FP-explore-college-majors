1981,A3S3R88HA0HZG3,0738921475,PT Cruiser,"[0, 0]","This movie is another great addition to the collection of Elmo DVD's I've purchased for my two parrots.  They love to watch movies and seem to like Sesame Street and especially like Elmo.  They actually talk back to him when he says, ""Hello"".  I find his voice a little annoying after a time, but I guess it's the animated voice with lots of different tones that they like.  He's also a very lively character along with Grover, Kermit, Cookie Monster, Bert, and Ernie, the rest of the Sesame Street cast.  The songs, as always in Sesame Street, are fun and entertaining.The movie is 50 minutes long which is nice because many of the other Sesame Street movies are only half an hour.  And as soon as the movie ends and the titles start to roll, the parrots start screaming for me to come and put on another movie.  So longer is better.  This is a particularly cute story based on Cinderella with lots of liberties taken with the story.  The ""people"" actors, Keri Russell, Kathy Najimy, Caroll Spinney, French Stewart, Oliver Platt do a good acting job and make the movie entertaining even for adults.  They interact well with the puppets making the whole thing sort of believable.  It seems like the sort of movie that children without feathers (as in human children) would enjoy too.  It's colorful, has lots of movement and characters with cute voices who talk to the kids (or parrots) and get them involved in the story.  I think that is one of the reasons the birds stay interested in Sesame Street, whereas they often ignore cartoons after a while and go off to some other area of their room and play with toys.  With this movie they sit on the perches closest to the screen and actually watch for a long time.I'm sure this will become one of the favorites in the Sesame Street collection and Elmo is endearing, as always.
