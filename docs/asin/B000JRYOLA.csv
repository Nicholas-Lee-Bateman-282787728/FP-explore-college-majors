You need the 1.5 firmware if you have a Toshiba HD-XA2 player.  Sound is OK nothing over the top.  Crowe's voice comes through very clean through the center channel.  A little long, but still very interesting title.",5,Awesome Discovery Atlas HD title,1179100800,"05 14, 2007",2007,352,"['excellent', 'example', 'HD', 'video', 'Crowe', 'great', 'job', 'narration', 'Very', 'informative', 'interesting', 'HD', 'DVD', 'Austrailia', 'need', '1.5', 'firmware', 'have', 'Toshiba', 'HD-XA2', 'player', 'Sound', 'OK', 'nothing', 'top', 'Crowe', 'voice', 'very', 'clean', 'center', 'channel', 'little', 'long', 'still', 'very', 'interesting', 'title']",N/A
1029102,A1CQXPD3D20ZID,B000JRYOLA,"D. Casey ""fastmover""","[2, 3]","Australia has always been of interest to me.  I have known some Aussies and they've always struck me as being laid back and eager to have fun.  This travel documentary narrated by Russell Crowe takes you into areas of Australia you didn't know existed and explores the land and its diversity of people. I was disappointed in this presentation in that it was heavy on the people, especially those Aborigines in the Outback and the rural sheep and cattle ranchers, and light on things I expected to see but didn't.  I wanted to see more of the South Coast, the Mountains, and Tasmania. Too much time was spent on a Vietnamese commedian who immigrated after Saigon fell, and a young woman swimmer in an iron woman competition, and a young female rancher in the Outback. Even though the photography and editing were superb, the content was lacking and I was disappointed. This could have been a lot better.",3,A So So Doc on Australia,1208390400,"04 17, 2008",2008,902,"['Australia', 'always', 'been', 'interest', 'have', 'known', 'Aussies', ""'ve"", 'always', 'struck', 'being', 'laid', 'back', 'eager', 'have', 'fun', 'travel', 'documentary', 'narrated', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'areas', 'Australia', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'existed', 'land', 'diversity', 'people', 'was', 'disappointed', 'presentation', 'was', 'heavy', 'people', 'especially', 'Aborigines', 'Outback', 'rural', 'sheep', 'cattle', 'ranchers', 'light', 'things', 'expected', 'see', 'did', ""n't"", 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'South', 'Coast', 'Mountains', 'Tasmania', 'Too', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'spent', 'Vietnamese', 'commedian', 'who', 'immigrated', 'Saigon', 'fell', 'young', 'woman', 'swimmer', 'iron', 'woman', 'competition', 'young', 'female', 'rancher', 'Outback', 'Even', 'photography', 'editing', 'were', 'superb', 'content', 'was', 'lacking', 'was', 'disappointed', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better']",N/A
1029103,A3CW94YYFXEBSI,B000JRYOLA,"Exercisemaniac ""bascelflt""","[6, 7]",A different viewpoint from the touristy travelogs on the country.  These Atlas Discovery DVD's are such high quality.  Russell Crowe's voice is a bit on the low side and my husband had trouble hearing all of the commentary but otherwise it was a really interesting visit.  Just by watching one feels they are meeting the people in the DVD personally and experiencing the culture.  We hope to visit Australia someday but in the meantime this is the next best thing we can do.  We highly recommend this DVD.,5,I can't wait to travel to Australia!,1240185600,"04 20, 2009",2009,505,"['different', 'viewpoint', 'touristy', 'travelogs', 'country', 'Atlas', 'Discovery', 'DVD', 'are', 'such', 'high', 'quality', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'voice', 'bit', 'low', 'side', 'husband', 'had', 'trouble', 'hearing', 'commentary', 'otherwise', 'was', 'really', 'interesting', 'visit', 'Just', 'watching', 'one', 'feels', 'are', 'meeting', 'people', 'DVD', 'personally', 'experiencing', 'culture', 'hope', 'visit', 'Australia', 'someday', 'meantime', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'do', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD']",N/A

I really enjoy this wonderful documentary. The PQ is great except a few scenes particulary the lifeguard competition which has grainy scenes. Overall the PQ looks stunning.The only small problem is some of the extra features can't play properly with occasional freezing. If you're not into the extras then this will be a great disc.
