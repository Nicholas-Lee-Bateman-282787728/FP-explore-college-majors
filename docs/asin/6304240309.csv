409467,A2UXROWP3KNUBB,6304240309,D. Andr,"[0, 0]","Made in 1943, this film from the collaboration between director Vittorio de Sica, Italian actor movie star of the '30s and the screenwriter Cesare Zavattini, is undoubtedly the first masterpiece signed De Sica (still require revision the few films he made before and Madeleine Zero in Conduct is not far from the claim). In all cases, it is a key work between cinema of the 30s, inherited from fascism and neo-realism that would follow. It can therefore be placed on the same plane as OBSESSIONE Visconti. Like the latter, THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING mark a break with the cinema of the 30s, referring to some previously taboo themes (adultery, unhappy childhood, critical view of society and the petty bourgeoisie, generally pampered by the regime).

Okay, so the war hadn't turned disastrous for Italy yet, But Mussolini was in power, censorship of the film industry was overwhelming even without Fascism, and the cinema industry had never yet failed to cater to the socially conservative taste of Italian audiences. Vittorio de Sica had starred in dozens of sappily sentimental romances. Yet this film was in effect the first expression of 'neorealism' in European cinema. With its scathing portrayal of shallow bourgeoise society, its subtle suggestion of class conflict, its scenes of adultery and its uncompromisingly tragic ending, surely ""The Children Are Watching Us"" would have shocked Italian audiences out of their theater seats. But it was barely finished by the time the war went wildly against Italy, and it was seen by few, nearly lost in the mayhem. De Sica went much farther in the direction of 'neorealism' in the aftermath of the war, with his ""Shoeshine"" in 1946 and his classic ""Bicycle Thieves"" in 1948.""The Children Are Watching Us"" is appropriately named. The film is subtly structured from the viewpoint of a little boy whose mother deserts him and his meticulous but unromantic father for a slick lover-boy. There's not a flicker of war or politics in the boy's perceptions, nor thus in the film, and that of course is amazing in itself, given when and where the film was made. The purity of the film's focus on the boy and the boy's perceptions is as clear as the black-and-white cinematography. For a film produced, perhaps with some secrecy, in a studio, the vividness of its images of Italy makes ""The Children"" a travelogue in time. One could turn off the sound and subtitles and still be entranced by the photography. Luckily for us, this film has been stunningly restored; the film and sound quality are better than most of the prints of Italian classics two decades newer. And, for those who want to relish the script in its proper language, the subtitles can be turned off. There are subtleties of dialect and characterization in the dialogue that are lost in translation.From de Sica and Lucchino Visconti to Federico Fellini, for the decade beginning in the middle of World War 2, the Italian cinema industry led the world in creativity, honesty, and artistry.

409470,A1W62UQWNZMM55,6304240309,"""infinitemovies""","[32, 34]","THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US was my official introduction to neo-realistic filmmaking and to Vittorio De Sica. After having seen this film i just could not get over how tragic and realistic it was. The story is about a couple and their little boy who seem to live a peaceful existence but the boy knows that his mother is having an affair. Soon after she abandons the family. This causes the father and especially the boy much grief. The father is unable to care for the boy so he sends him to other family members. The boy begins to suffer internally until finally his mother decides to come back and the father reluctantly decides to accept her. The boy is happy once again but the mother's ex lover will not leave her alone and once again tries to make her leave her family for him. Soon after sad consequences follow and an ending which will make you cry enough to supply water for the world population. It is very well directed, acted, and written but it is also at times hard to take because it is so painfully realistic and also because all these tragic things are happening to an innocent child. The black and white color and photography give it in some parts a semi-documentery feel and authentic locations are used in this movie. Most of the story is seen from the child's point of view so it will affect anyone who has gone through similar situations. I could understand the child's grief so it was especially moving for me. The movie is undeniably well made but is not really the kind of movie where you plan to have repeat viewings.",5,' Children' is heart breaking and realistic.,997574400,"08 12, 2001",2001,1545,"['CHILDREN', 'ARE', 'WATCHING', 'US', 'was', 'official', 'introduction', 'neo-realistic', 'filmmaking', 'Vittorio', 'De', 'Sica', 'having', 'seen', 'film', 'i', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'how', 'tragic', 'realistic', 'was', 'story', 'couple', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'seem', 'live', 'peaceful', 'existence', 'boy', 'mother', 'having', 'affair', 'Soon', 'family', 'father', 'especially', 'boy', 'much', 'grief', 'father', 'unable', 'care', 'boy', 'so', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'boy', 'suffer', 'internally', 'finally', 'mother', 'come', 'back', 'father', 'reluctantly', 'accept', 'boy', 'happy', 'once', 'again', 'mother', 'ex', 'lover', 'will', 'not', 'leave', 'alone', 'once', 'again', 'tries', 'make', 'leave', 'family', 'Soon', 'sad', 'consequences', 'follow', 'ending', 'will', 'make', 'cry', 'enough', 'supply', 'water', 'world', 'population', 'very', 'well', 'directed', 'acted', 'written', 'also', 'times', 'hard', 'take', 'so', 'painfully', 'realistic', 'also', 'tragic', 'things', 'are', 'happening', 'innocent', 'child', 'black', 'white', 'color', 'photography', 'give', 'parts', 'semi-documentery', 'feel', 'authentic', 'locations', 'are', 'used', 'movie', 'Most', 'story', 'seen', 'child', 'point', 'view', 'will', 'affect', 'anyone', 'who', 'gone', 'similar', 'situations', 'could', 'understand', 'child', 'grief', 'was', 'especially', 'moving', 'movie', 'undeniably', 'well', 'made', 'not', 'really', 'kind', 'movie', 'where', 'plan', 'have', 'repeat', 'viewings']",The Children Are Watching Us VHS

Set in the last great summer of Fascist Italy, much of it intriguingly takes place in a Rome and a coastal resort that don't even notice there's a war going on: no shortages, no bomb damage, not even a single army uniform in sight, which in a way gives it a more timeless quality - even the apartment blocks its middle class characters live in can still be found all over Italy. The story is a simple one, with a child caught in the middle of his parents dissolving marriage and finding his loyalties torn as his weak-willed mother constantly returns to her lover, but it's told with a surprising degree of naturalism. It also takes on an extra dimension with the knowledge that De Sica was himself having an affair when he was making it.
