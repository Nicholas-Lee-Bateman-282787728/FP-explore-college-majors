It's a great story, and it's creatively written.The movie on the other hand is incredibly disappointing. The acting is on par with your local community theater; most of the actors sound like they're reciting lines from a script, and give no personality to the characters. There was a tremendous lack of character development, including Rudy, one of the key characters in the book. Rudy and Liesel's relationship is never quite developed, and is mostly implied, until the end. Rudy's body is pulled from the rubble, and he's alive (...and he wasn't in the book.) long enough to tell Liesel that he l-l-l-loves her (...which he never did in the book.).Death, the narrator of the book, sounds like a pretentious Englishman in the movie, reciting lines from a book.All movies change various aspects of the book so that it all fits within a 2 hour movie. What was changed was needlessly changed. A remarkable book was adapted into a sub-par movie. My lasting impression was that the director didn't care about the book, and was just doing a job. He didn't take care to, or was not skilled enough to translate an incredible book into an incredible movie.If you read the book and you feel like you have to watch the movie, trust me, you don't.

1675651,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00G15MDI0,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","This may make me sound really stupid, but it always takes me aback when I realize that the atrocities of the Holocaust and Hitler&#8217;s regime took place during the 1900&#8217;s.  Seeing dates that took place in the late 30&#8217;s and early 40&#8217;s splash onto the screen while watching this film made my stomach curl a little more because it made these events feel so recent, and in my mind they aren&#8217;t.  I guess that is the horror of real life, the realization that these things do happen and happen in the lifetimes of those we know, love and hold dear.  It isn&#8217;t that I didn&#8217;t know they took place so recently, because I did, but it isn&#8217;t a reality that I acknowledge enough for it to not be shocking.Am I making sense?Anyways, that was the first thing that struck me about &#8216;The Book Thief&#8217;.  These events, while harrowing in their historical relevance, are still relevant today because they are much closer to home than we often realize.Sadly, the second thing I noticed was not as endearing.For me, &#8216;The Book Thief&#8217; works so well except for one central element that took away from and actually worked against the film in some very key areas.  I mean, did anyone else know that this movie was narrated by death?  Can anyone explain to me WHY this movie is narrated by death?  I can&#8217;t be the only one who found it unnecessary and gimmicky and completely disjointed from the film, and in the film&#8217;s heartbreaking climax it actually became a major emotional deterrent.  I hate that it is the one element of the film I remember most.  I sticks out like such a sore thumb that it literally ruins some of the key parts of the film and lessens the impact the story would have had.I understand wanted something to make your film standout from the rest, but usually you want that &#8216;something&#8217; to be something&#8230;good.The story told is that of young Liesel.  In the beginning of the story we meet her on a train with her mother and sickly brother, who within seconds dies, leaving Liesel alone in the world.  The reason for this is that Liesel and her brother were on their way to being placed in foster care.  Their mother was a communist fleeing the country for her life.  Liesel winds up in the care of the Hubermanns.  Hans is a kind man, lazy and childish and endearing.  Rosa, his wife, is hardened.  She is stern and blunt and instantly looks at Liesel as a burden.  Hitler&#8217;s rule is becoming very prominent, and war is eminent, and the small street that Liesel becomes a part of is drastically altered due to this fact, especially when a Jew named Max shows up on the Hubermann doorstep.Weaving the political aspects of the story with the universal concept of childhood and the love of literature (and the ability to make a difference through your &#8216;words&#8217;) takes a little getting used to, especially since it doesn&#8217;t all seem to gel as fluidly (or as relatively) as they would want it to.  Still, it does make an impact, and the actors do everything they can to sell this film to us.  Young Sophie Nelisse is a real find, but the film belongs to both Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson, who display such organic emotions throughout the course of the film.I wish that the film had stripped itself of the narration altogether.

Liesel must grow up and adapt to the changing social atmosphere. During this time she acquires the nasty habit of reading.

1675677,A1Q6PG0Y3XZL7M,B00G15MDI0,"Book & Music thief, from HI","[9, 13]","A few critics have expressed the view, that this film should have reflected a 'darker' realism and maintained a more intense tone throughought (as in many other works, taking place during the Holocaust era).  But in fairness, it is important to take into account the specific context of the original source book, and the youthful viewpoint of the story's main protagonist - geared somewhat towards younger audiences, probably for good reason = the possible hope that younger generations not forget this dark period in history (and continue to learn from it), by also prompting further discussions and readings in schools, and other venues (always a good idea). But this outstanding production, has more than enough 'gems' for adults to discover, and be enlightened by, as well!With that preface, I personally think 'The Book Thief' is a truly excellent and important film, that succeeds in the difficult task of 'bringing to Life' Markus Zusak's inspiring and thoroughly thought provoking book, set in Germany, roughly during the Holocaust period (and even filmed largely at the famed Babelsberg Studio*), shedding light on certain aspects of daily life, not commonly focused upon in most popular fiction dealing with that very dark/ bleak period in history.  In fact, what makes the original novel, and this film quite unique, is the roller-coaster like shifting from 'darkness to light' (and back again, sometimes unexpectedly) that makes this story, and film quite different from other significant Holocaust period Works (or many of the other films relating the horrors of Nazism).  'Schindler's List' (the finest, and most important), and also the 'Pianist' rightfully concentrate on fully reflecting the 'inhumanity' and the calculated base cruelty of the Nazi regime - and any lightness, or sustained optimism exhibited by the lead characters would have seemed out-of-place, and might have even risked a loss of focus, or diversion from their consistently 'intense' narratives.  But by contrast, the character focus of the Book Thief essentially centers around Liesel Meminger's youthful view of Life, and her burgeoning (but by no means comprehensive) 'awareness' of the evils really transpiring in the larger society around her (the surrounding characters representing very 'ordinary' German citizens - a few, even living on the outer rungs of German society, both politically and economically).  Through Papa Hans' overtly (and Rosa's covertly) caring natures, and of course Liesel's own initial fascination with, growing appreciation of/ dedication to, and eventual actual love of Words/ Literature = her inner capacity for empathy/ compassion seems to grow exponentially (and far beyond her years) - this process is especially true, and beautifully portrayed in both original book, and film through Liesel's seeming ability to bring Max Vandenburg (the hidden Jew) literally back to Life, through her tireless efforts, reading all those stolen books to the barely conscious Max (he being in the throes of serious malady, akin to pneumonia, from frozen basement life).But this is meant as a recommendation for this specific and outstanding filmed version, and not another book/story review (although couldn't quite resist).  Therefore, in a nutshell:  Brian Percival's direction is 'spot on' in terms of getting all the characters right, and they all seem very much alive and 'spontaneous' none of their actions (or acting) seems in any way forced, or unnatural, and there is an abundance of 'chemistry' between all actors involved.  Actress Sophie Nelisse really stands-out, her portrayal of Liesel is full of requisite (initial) diffidence with growing wonderment as she discovers her 'new eyes' ultimately becoming a wellspring of compassion & courage (but always with a spontaneous, playful glint in those 'new' eyes, ever open to, and ready to 'take in' new discoveries/ insights).  Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson are brilliant, as usual (I think 'Shine' has one of the most impressive, and heartfelt performances of any actor, in the last twenty years or so, and the 'Luzhin Defense' is a truly marvelously acted 'gem' that deserves to be seen by millions - Look for the DVD now!).  All other acting is also exceptionally fine (the young actor playing Rudy is also spot on, and the Max Vandenburg character, although not given that much screen time - makes a very deep, indelible impact - and remains pivotal to Liesel's ultimate growth/ development, and the interaction between these two characters is, at times, indeed wondrously done, the brevity of these scenes perhaps making them even more vital and memorable).  If I were to mention one minor critique (which I hate to have to do - because it is probably an impossible task to get this aspect really right, in the medium of film), it is that the character/ narrator 'death' is not nearly as interesting, as in Markus Zusak's original novel.  In the book, you hear a lot more from Mr. Death, and I think most readers begin to believe, as the book progresses, that 'death' is actually developing a marked 'conscience' (though it would never admit to such a transgression) -  adding a truly fascinating layer to the novel, but this does not really come across in the movie.  I would still give this film a TOP review/ rating - but more importantly, I think this film will eventually be widely seen (Worldwide in 2014 - and on DVD and in schools, for many years to come), which will promote much valuable discussion of both these very dark historical times, but also of the human spirit's uncanny ability to resist/ survive tremendous adversity during exceedingly dark times, particularly when we are able to find the keys to unlock/ fully access the 'humanity' within (thanks largely, to our inner 'book thief')!  Major Kudos to all involved with making this truly important movie (and of course, to the writer of the highly acclaimed, and immensely popular source book) - not to be missed, in either form!!  Also, must mention that the authentic Living Legend John Williams, provides one of his best film scores (this Music being both heartfelt, and intimate) = a worthy companion piece to Williams' immortal Schindler's List score (some of the absolute finest Music ever to grace movie screens)!note*  Fritz Lang's groundbreaking ""Metropolis"" was filmed at Babelsberg - being the first authentic feature length Science Fiction film, and still one of the most impressive (even in the age of CGI effects).",5,"The Book Thief, a film truly ""Full of Wonders""",1387843200,"12 24, 2013",2013,6475,"['few',

The narrative structure begins rather surprisingly, with Death as the deep-voiced, but mellow, narrator.  In 1938 in Nazi Germany, an orphan named Liesel is adopted by a bristly new mother and much gentler new father.  Emily Watson plays the mother and Geoffrey Rush the father.  Liesel gets to know a blonde-haired, pleasant, free-spirited boy in the town, Rudy, and also must face the daily struggle of hiding a Jewish refugee named Max for over 2 years, after Kristallnacht.  She also secretly raids the Burgermeister's personal library because she wants to read, which becomes another major subplot.The story is original and has some moments of deep suspense, but since it strives for realism, also has tragedy; that's the way life goes in war.  (My own personal reaction to its theme about the fragility of life:  Stories like this are strong reminders to me of how unbearable life can be when you don't have a basis for confidence about life after death.  Too bad that in her love of literature, the character Liesel didn't discover the Bible and the hope it offers of that!)I found it worth seeing, though it is deeply sad in ways.  There are enjoyable sentimental and suspenseful moments in it, though. The actors all do very well, including the Liesel actress, Sophie N&eacute;lisse, and Nico Liersch, who plays her boyfriend Rudy.  The quality acting helps the movie feel like an authentic rendition of life under the Nazi regime.  I most of all like Geoffrey Rush's characterization of the adopted father, Hans Hubermann.  He ought to get an Academy Award for his great performance.  Additionally, John Williams wrote the music to this, his first non-Spielberg collaboration in a long while.",4,What life was like growing up in Nazi Germany,1386288000,"12 6, 2013",2013,1787,"['am', 'unfamiliar', 'book', 'review', 'will', 'take', 'movie', 'own', 'terms', 'narrative', 'structure', 'rather', 'surprisingly', 'Death', 'deep-voiced', 'mellow', 'narrator', '1938', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'orphan', 'named', 'Liesel', 'adopted', 'bristly', 'new', 'mother', 'much', 'gentler', 'new', 'father', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'mother', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'father', 'Liesel', 'know', 'blonde-haired', 'pleasant', 'free-spirited', 'boy', 'town', 'Rudy', 'also', 'must', 'face', 'daily', 'struggle', 'hiding', 'Jewish', 'refugee', 'named', 'Max', '2', 'years', 'Kristallnacht', 'also', 'secretly', 'Burgermeister', 'personal', 'library', 'read', 'major', 'subplot.The', 'story', 'original', 'moments', 'deep', 'suspense', 'realism', 'also', 'tragedy', 'way', 'life', 'war', 'own', 'personal', 'reaction', 'theme', 'fragility', 'life', 'Stories', 'are', 'strong', 'reminders', 'how', 'unbearable', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'basis', 'confidence', 'life', 'death', 'Too', 'bad', 'love', 'literature', 'character', 'Liesel', 'did', ""n't"", 'discover', 'Bible', 'hope', 'found', 'worth', 'seeing', 'deeply', 'sad', 'ways', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'sentimental', 'suspenseful', 'moments', 'though', 'actors', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'including', 'Liesel', 'actress', 'Sophie', 'N', 'eacute', 'Nico', 'Liersch', 'who', 'boyfriend', 'Rudy', 'quality', 'acting', 'movie', 'feel', 'authentic', 'rendition', 'life', 'Nazi', 'regime', 'most', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'characterization', 'adopted', 'father', 'Hans', 'Hubermann', 'ought', 'get', 'Academy', 'Award', 'great', 'performance', 'Additionally', 'John', 'Williams', 'wrote', 'music', 'first', 'non-Spielberg', 'collaboration', 'long', 'while']",N/A

The adoptive mother is initially portrayed as a very selfish, cold woman, who only cared about getting money from the government for the children they were adopting.

Almost seventy years since the end of World War II witnesses to the atrocities of the Germans are dwindling to a few.  The makers of &#34;The Book Thief&#34; have an interesting take on what occurred at that time.  Seen through the eyes of a young girl, Liesel (Sophie Nelisse), the film begins prior to the invasion of Poland and ends when hostilities between the superpowers ends.  Liesel begins the film as a fragile and frightened illiterate young girl taken from a mother with Communist sympathies to a young woman wizened to the horrors humanity is capable of but assured of her own moral compass.  The setting of the film is the picaresque village Liesel goes to live with her adoptive parents, Hans (Geoffrey Rush) and Rosa (Emily Watson), and it serves as a microcosm of the cancer that infected the Fatherland.  Liesel sees with eyes agape everything from a book burning to commemorate Der Fuhrer's birthday to Jews being marched though her town to their ultimate fate in the concentration camps.  Nelisse  giving a sterling performance anchors the film quite nicely.  The supporting cast is uniformly excellent with a special shout out to young Nico Liersch who plays Liesel's friend, Rudy, a boy who emulates the African-American track star Jesse Owens.  The beauty of the film is it works on an adult level but should be accessible to older adolescents and teenagers.

I am about the same age as the children in the story but had the good fortune to be born in the United States. The story tells us of a young girl who has to leave all she has known and live with foster parents in Germany at the time Hitler was gaining control over that nation.The young girl, Liesel Meminger, played with charming innocence by Sophie N&eacute;lisse, must adjust to her new life and the changes Hitler was bringing to Germany. The movie tells that story with great skill and immerses the viewer in a world that is both fearful and fascinating. Liesel's foster parents, Hans and Rosa Huberman, played by Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson, are doing their best to cope with all of the changes that are taking place and provide a much needed refuge for Liesel.One of the interesting twists of the story is the off-screen narration by a voice representing death. Needless to say death is very busy at this point in history.Other supporting parts are all convincingly played and the total impact of the movie is one that will not be easily forgotten. The overall impact for me was to again be reminded of the foolish horror of war; living in the United States, I only heard reports of what was happening long after the events had taken place.This is a serious and stirring movie; certainly not light entertainment.

1675752,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00G15MDI0,Doug Park,"[1, 1]","{4.5 stars}THE BOOK THIEF is the most poignant and haunting film that I have seen in some time, one that will stay with me for years. Sophie N&eacute;lisse gives an outstanding performance as Liesel Meminger, an initially illiterate but incredibly imaginative and independent girl who's full of splendid metaphors and similes --e.g., ""The sun looks like a silver oyster""--and, with the help of various diverse people, discovers the power of books and the written word while living with foster parents in Hitler's Germany. Virtually every other player in this film gives a fine performance, and the very special narrator, Roger Allam as the somber yet strangely unforbidding voice of Death, adds a distinct touch, coming in at just the right crucial moments.I have never seen anything remotely like THE BOOK THIEF and can only say that I wish there were more like it. The best way I can describe it is like a dark yet ultimately heartwarming Disney film for adults. It is, of course, a Fox 2000 production expertly directed by Englishman Brian Percival, spoken mostly in English--albeit, with some speeches in German w/English subtitles--with a cast of various nationalities. Still, the characters are all most convincingly German. It captures the lives of ordinary German citizens during WWII in a way I've never seen done in any non-German film. The accents and various mannerism are very, very real and immediate. The cinematography is also excellent, with stunning views of the town and countryside and, even when viewed from approaching Allied bombers, the sky above them. THE BOOK THIEF is driven mostly by its characters, themes, and atmosphere. Nevertheless, even if it takes a while to find itself, the plot also makes perfect sense (allowing for the various elements of magical realism), moves at a natural pace, and is ultimately quite gripping.Though I loved every second of this film, a common criticism seems to be that it simply does not do justice to Markus Zusak's original novel,The Book Thief. Film adaptations, of course, often make serious departures from the books that spawned them, and it's fairly impossible to completely capture a really great novel on screen. Though I have not yet read the novel, I could tell that the directors and writers had a lot to pick and choose regarding what/whatnot to show. There are a few patchy spots: In particular, I wanted a little better sense of Liesel's origins. In this respect, I can only say that this film should prove an excellent illuminator for the book, which I am now eager to read.",5,"""She was one of the few souls that made me wonder what it was to live""",1393200000,"02 24, 2014",2014,2554,"['4.5', 'stars', 'THE', 'BOOK', 'THIEF', 'most', 'poignant', 'haunting', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'time', 'one', 'will', 'stay', 'years', 'Sophie', 'N', 'eacute', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Liesel', 'Meminger', 'initially', 'illiterate', 'incredibly', 'imaginative', 'independent', 'girl', 'who', 'full', 'splendid', 'metaphors', 'similes', 'e.g.', 'sun', 'silver', 'oyster', 'help', 'various', 'diverse', 'people', 'power', 'books', 'written', 'word', 'living', 'foster', 'parents', 'Hitler', 'Germany', 'Virtually', 'other', 'player', 'film', 'fine', 'performance', 'very', 'special', 'narrator', 'Roger', 'Allam', 'somber', 'yet', 'strangely', 'unforbidding', 'voice', 'Death', 'distinct', 'touch', 'coming', 'just', 'right', 'crucial', 'moments.I', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'remotely', 'THE', 'BOOK', 'THIEF', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'best', 'way', 'can', 'describe', 'dark', 'yet', 'ultimately', 'heartwarming', 'Disney', 'film', 'adults', 'course', 'Fox', '2000', 'production', 'expertly', 'directed', 'Englishman', 'Brian', 'Percival', 'spoken', 'mostly', 'English', 'albeit', 'speeches', 'German', 'w/English', 'subtitles', 'cast', 'various', 'nationalities', 'Still', 'characters', 'are', 'most', 'convincingly', 'German', 'lives', 'ordinary', 'German', 'citizens', 'WWII', 'way', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'done', 'non-German', 'film', 'accents', 'various', 'mannerism', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'real', 'immediate', 'cinematography', 'also', 'excellent', 'stunning', 'views', 'town', 'countryside', 'even', 'when', 'viewed', 'approaching', 'Allied', 'bombers', 'sky', 'BOOK', 'THIEF', 'driven', 'mostly', 'characters', 'themes', 'atmosphere', 'Nevertheless', 'even', 'while', 'find', 'plot', 'also', 'perfect', 'sense', 'allowing', 'various', 'elements', 'magical', 'realism', 'moves', 'natural', 'pace', 'ultimately', 'quite', 'gripping.Though', 'loved', 'second', 'film', 'common', 'criticism', 'be', 'simply', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'Markus', 'Zusak', 'original', 'novel', 'Book', 'Thief', 'Film', 'adaptations', 'course', 'often', 'make', 'serious', 'departures', 'books', 'spawned', 'fairly', 'impossible', 'completely', 'capture', 'really', 'great', 'novel', 'screen', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'read', 'novel', 'could', 'tell', 'directors', 'writers', 'had', 'lot', 'pick', 'choose', 'regarding', 'what/whatnot', 'show', 'are', 'few', 'patchy', 'spots', 'particular', 'wanted', 'little', 'better', 'sense', 'Liesel', 'origins', 'respect', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'film', 'should', 'prove', 'excellent', 'illuminator', 'book', 'am', 'now', 'eager', 'read']",N/A
1675753,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B00G15MDI0,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[3, 4]","Brian Percival's film of the Markus Zuzak novel contains two stand-out performances from Sophie Nelisse and Nico Liersch as the two children Liesel and Rudi.  Caught in a complex world they understand little about, they try to pursue their day-to-day lives under the most trying curcumstances.  Liesel, transplanted to a German town and billeted with a new family, has to cope with a domineering foster-mother (Emily Watson) while trying to manage at a new school where she is taunted for her inability to read.  Rudi, the perfect example of a blnd-haired Aryan, ends up rebelling against his prescribed destiny, which is to be sent away for &#34;special training&#34; in the Nazi army.  Apart from these performances, however, the film is a disappointment.  The narrative unfolds at a sluggish pace, with treacly music by John Williams lending a sentimental edge to a profoundly unsentimental story.  There is also the question of accents: one wonders why the main characters have to speak in the faux-German English accents punctuated with occasional German words &#34;Ja&#34; or &#34;Nein&#34; or &#34;und,&#34; reminiscent of the British sitcom 'ALLO 'ALLO.  This seems all the more incongruous when the script is peppered with American English neologisms.  Why the characters couldn't have spoken in their normal voices seems a mystery to me.  Thematically speaking, the film has a lot to say about the power of writing - even in a repressive regime such as Naz&#305; Germany, Liesel and her Jewish friend Max Vandenburg (Ben Schnezter) understand how important it is to read and write.  Liesel's adoptive father Hans Huberman (Geoffrey Rush) thinks much the same way - despite limited reading skills, he encourages Liesel to write all her new words on a board to compile her own dictionary.  At the end of the film Liesel emerges as a powerful figure, one who can even cheat Death (Roger Allam) in the sense that her words - and her thoughts - live on through her books.

1675768,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00G15MDI0,FNDNreview,"[4, 8]","It has been a busy 2013 for novel-to-film adaptations. Clearly, the biggest and most outstanding film in that club has been The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, with The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug and World War Z also being noteworthy examples of prosperous films. But, one of the more underrated adaptions, taking place in the unimaginable setting of Nazi Germany, is Australian author Markus Zusak's story, The Book Thief.British director Brian Percival takes on Michael Petroni's screenplay in the film imagining of The Book Thief, a story taking place during World War II &#8211; a time that was full of discrimination, war, and the major purge of society. The main character is Liesel Meminger (Sophie N&eacute;lisse), a young girl that is adopted by two loving German's, Hans Hubermann (Geoffrey Rush) and his wife, Rosa (Emily Watson). For sure, Liesel finds the transition period to be rough with getting to know her new parents, dealing with bullies at school, and attempting to find her place in a fascist nation. Fortunately, a young boy and also her next door neighbor, Rudy Steiner (Nico Liersch), quickly befriends her. After a short amount of time, the two are basically inseparable &#8211; but, a secret stands between them.One day, a young man knocks on the front door of the Hubermann household. His name is Max (Ben Schnetzer) and he is the son of a man that saved Hans' life during World War I. Hans vowed that if there was anything he or his family could do to repay the sacrifice, he would not hesitate. Unfortunately, Max is a Jewish man living in a country where he's surrounded by hatred and a government that is maliciously unrelenting towards the individuals of his ethnicity. With nowhere else to go, Max asks for a place to hide &#8211; thus putting the family in a difficult position, but a position they will not ignore.At the same time, Liesel has grown fond of learning to read, which her new adoptive father was more than happy to teach her. Even since she finished her first book, she has been willing to read anything and everything. One day, she takes a basket of laundry to the house of Ilsa Hermann, the wife of a well-off German official (Liesel's adoptive mother has been doing Ilsa's husband's laundry for years). The Hermann estate happens to house a vast library of which Liesel is instantly infatuated with and is allowed to visit often to read. Eventually, the business relationship comes to an end, which prompts Liesel to begin sneaking into the Hermann's house to borrow books to read (that she does return when she's finished).As you might expect, the complications arise from Max living in the household, along with the growing unrest from the events of World War II. Random bombings become a regular occurrence, throwing the entire area into panic and disarray. To make matters worse, basically any able-bodied male is called to defend their country, including those closest to Liesel. Emotions run high as she is forced to contend with more emotion in a short amount of time than most people experience in a lifetime.If you've read the novel prior to seeing the film, you'll obviously notice several different nuances &#8211; but nothing that's detrimental to the original plot. For the most part, the sentiment of this story is in the right spot, yet one of the factors that should have played a heavier role in the film is the impact Nazi Germany had on society. This was a place in time where the smallest indiscretion could easily lead to being shot in the street or put on a train to an interment camp. Still, the Nazi's are not depicted in the fearful manner that they could have been. However, keep in mind The Book Thief is a story written for young adults and with that in mind, this story may be a bit overwhelming for the same target audience in which the book was originally written. For someone who's unfamiliar with the novel, it might be hard to interpret the message of this story: a message that shows the importance of family, generosity, and survival.For me (someone that absolutely loves history), this film was everything I could have imagined and more. The story is certainly unique, but it's the cast that does a tremendous job of bringing these characters from the page to the screen. Sophie N&eacute;lisse is quite impressive in the lead as Liesel. It's a rarity for someone so young to provide such mastery in a role that has layers upon layers of depth. For such a young girl, her journey throughout this small German community is quite extraordinary. Initially, she's just a curious, vulnerable girl &#8211; but one act of bravery (or stupidity if she would have been caught) defines who she is: a thief. In fact, she might be the most honorable, noble thief in the history of storytelling.The supporting cast surrounding N&eacute;lisse couldn't have been any better, and that includes the performance given by her onscreen neighbor and cohort, portrayed by young Nico Liersch. He just seems to mesh with N&eacute;lisse perfectly, as he humorously courts her and values their friendship from the very beginning. Just as important as Liersch's performance is that of the Liesel's adoptive parents, portrayed flawlessly by both Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson. Although Watson stands out a bit more (because of her strict nature) than Rush, they both prove to be the most loving parents a seemingly lost girl could ask for &#8211; and are absolutely vital to the development of Liesel into young womanhood.Surprisingly (especially for the non-readers), the revelation of the mysterious voice that narrates various portions of the film will have more of an impact than you'd expect. He pops in from time to time, but viewers would normally be safe to assume that it's someone that Liesel or perhaps the family will encounter somewhere along the line in the future. That statement couldn't be any further from the truth. Still, this unforgiving narrator leaves his mark in the final moments &#8211; which progress rather quickly after a lengthy war that's hardly described in much detail. To be honest, unless you're loosely familiar with certain dates or events in German history, a few events in this film will be lost on you (such as the reason the Nazi regime burns books in the first place or the seemingly random emphasis on the 1936 Olympic games). Have no fear, this small inconvenience doesn't weigh the film down in any manner.Overall, The Book Thief adaptation to film is an adequate rendition of Markus Zusak's young adult novel. It might not be everything you'd hope and dream of as a history buff, but the sentiment is there and it tells a moving story &#8211; not to mention John Williams composing (Star Wars, Jurassic Park). The ending turns out to be quite the handful and sadly, it won't send you home with a resounding smile on your face. On the other hand, the significant elements, like the cinematography, costuming, and poverty stricken settings all sell this as a film straight out of the early 1940s in Nazi occupied Germany. Even to this day, it's hard to believe how such a period in human history could even take place, and this movie serves as a brief, demoralizing glimmer of what innocent people were forced to endure. At the end of the day, all are encouraged to give this film a chance even though most will find the historical backdrop to be a bit of a bore.GRADE:  BFNDNreview.com",4,Sophie N&eacute;lisse brings

It failed. But here it is now in DVD format and in many ways this may be the best way to absorb this compelling story.THE BOOK THIEF, based on the beloved bestselling World War II-era novel by Markus Zusak and adapted for the screen by Michael Petroni, tells the story of Liesel Meminger (Sophie N&eacute;lisse),a spirited and courageous young girl who transforms the lives of everyone around her when she is sent to live with a foster family, Hans Hubermann (Geoffrey Rush) and his caustic wife Rosa (Emily Watson) in World War II Germany. Her brother has died and her mother is selling Liesel for cash. She arrives having just stolen her first book, ""The Gravediggers Handbook"" - it will be the beginning of a love affair with books. Her new Papa teaches her to read and bestows love and affection while Mama remains businesslike and cold. Liesel's only friend is Rudy (Nico Liersch), a spicy little neighbor boy with whom she becomes close. The Hubermann's agree to hide a young Jewish lad Max Vandenburg (Ben Schnetzer), the son of a close family friend, who is ill. The Hubermanns and Liesel nurse him back to health but as the war progresses Max must leave to prevent the Hubermanns from being discovered as harboring a Jew. Papa is conscripted but returns and eventually the village is bombed at the peak of the war. How Liesel deals with all of these changes makes for a fascinating, emotionally gripping story.The aspects of the film are so beautifully wrought - acting, cinematography (Florian Ballhaus), musical score (John Williams), screenplay, story - that this is a film that likely will become part of movie lovers' libraries. The fact that it is narrated by Death (Roger Allam) may have put off many people in the theater. At home, it is simply another haunting element Highly Recommended.

1675808,A3IXZJ1L73DYTA,B00G15MDI0,Jack E. Levic,"[0, 0]","I'm a history buff so I eagerly anticipated THE BOOK THIEF knowing it was set in WWII Germany. There have been countless movies set in this period telling the countless story of a terrible time. We see life during war through the eyes of a young German girl. It seemed like there was a chance to tell a different story but all the potential is lost in a rather listless story.First, the good points of this film that make the film worth watching. There is a phenomenal cast headed by a lovely and talented young actress Sophie Nelisse. Her large inquisitive eyes tell a story in themselves. She shines in the film and watching her is the true gem of this film. Starring as her adoptive parents are Emily Watson and Geoffrey Rush--two fine actors who we just don't see enough of on film. Also, the authentic setting and clothing add a realistic tone to this period piece. We seem to be off to a good start..well, if only...Young Liesel and her brother are being taken on a train trip by their mother. We soon learn the pair are being taken for adoption but tragedy strikes will on the train. It's never really clear why the mother is giving up her beloved children other than a vague reference to her being a communist. Was she about to be arrested by the Gestapo or was she trying to escape? We never know.Liesel is adopted by a kindly Hans (Geoffrey Rush) and his bitter shrew of a wife Rosa (Emily Watson). Again, it's not clear why a poor and struggling middle-aged couple adopt Liesel. Rosa's bitterness is never explained nor do we know why the couple is childless--was it by choice or did they lose a child or more through the eyes.Some background would help us better understand and relate to the characters.From here the movie drags on and Liesel tries to adapt to her new life and the attentions of her neighbor Rudy.We learn that Liesel's obsession with books is clouded by the fact that she cannot read. And she is not really a book thief but rather someon who finds lost books and later &#34;borrows&#34; books she returns, so why is she the &#34;book thief?&#34;. Enter Max, the young Jewish man that Hans and Rose hide and you have a rather typical WWII film but without the details.The story meanders and we only get glimpses of the hardship of German citizens in World War II. The scenes of Jewish people being dragged away are minimal so we really have a story of people who are struggling but maybe not suffering all that much--until the allied bombing begins.As an odd story plot, death narrates the film. For the longest time, I thought it was HANS telling the story but towards the end of the film, it is clear Death comes calling as he tells the story. The Death character voiceover seemed like a disappointing way to tie up the film and provide an ending. It also takes away from the authenticity of the story.

1675814,AIO247KHD2O40,B00G15MDI0,James N Simpson,"[1, 1]","The Book Thief is a watchable contribution to the already very heavily saturated life of those living in Europe while World War II happened around them genre.  For me though this was sort of like a children's film, I'm not sure it's supposed to be in fact I thought it was an adult market film, there's no blood there's not really any violence, and yet we had scenes where there should have been a lot of injuries and blood.  Also tension wise is never very high, never at any time does the viewer feel that Liesel (the main character, a young girl) is in danger of anything bad happening to her let alone death, when of course their should have been a constant feeling of fear of the consequences for her if her neighbours or the soldiers discovered her actions and those of her family.  The Liesel character is a likeable one which is always good when a film revolves mostly around one character, and played well by Sophie Nelisse.  If anything though Liesel is a little too nice, she's never gets up to anything mischief or misbehaves which is not that plausible for any kid.  I would have liked to have seen when under stress swear at someone or something like that.  Again that's why this sort of has the impression of being a Disney style kid's movie.  For much of the film Liesel and her adoptive family are supposed to be eating very little and struggling financially but they all always look well fed and well off.  Again this gives the feeling of a kids film where we want to tell the story but not make it too real.A hint of spoilers in the next sentences if you continue to read on.  At one point the bully kid and obvious town snitch eager to pass on anything that can score him points, especially if it brings misery to others, is discovered in the vicinity of Liesel stupidly confessing to her stalker/friend that her adoptive family is hiding someone in their basement.  Now this should have made the film a lot better, at this point in the film the plot had pretty much just been treading water, and going around in circles, it wasn't going anywhere and this would have been a great direction for the film to follow, with the fear of what does he know, will he tell, should we maybe cross a moral line ourselves to prevent an innocent man and ourselves probably as well being killed?  The threat isn't really dwelled on let alone dealt with, in fact I don't remember ever seeing that bully character again.  The film also could have gone down the stalker neighbour kid angle of blackmailing the obviously not interested in him in that way Liesel, to give into his constant demands of kissing him, in return for his silence.  Then we could have seen what Liesel could come up with to outwit or get out of that situation.  But again the film simply forgets about that, with just a one line in the basement by Liesel, ""oh by the way I told whatever his name was.""Speaking of lines, why if everyone is speaking in fluent English did the makers decide to substitute the odd word such as no for nein?  This was very noticeable and not in a good way and didn't come across as natural speaking but instead was rather comical, like an old Maxwell Smart episode or something.  Also what was the point of death's narration? The novel this is based on is famous for having the angle of telling the story through Death's eyes, but the occasional voiceover just seemed to be in the movie simply because of that and didn't really work.  In fact if you weren't familiar with the novel's hype you probably wouldn't even know it was supposed to be Death.  I actually thought it was Geoffrey Rush's voice so assumed his character was somehow either Death at the time or like many a kids' Christmas movie, he takes over the job at some point in the film and was wondering when exactly this was going to happen as the movie went on or be explained.  They should really have gone with a more distinctive, maybe deeper voice to play Death and probably given him a lot more lines if they were going to include him.The movie was fairly predictable (obviously we know how World War II ends but beyond that).  Again more spoilers - after the bombing it was pretty obvious everyone in her adoptive family was going to be dead, probably wasn't so obvious they would just have the actor's lie there on top of rubble with a bit of dust painted on them rather than have parts of them crushed, bloodied or missing all together (hence explaining how they died). It was also obvious the cheesy scene with the stalker friend finally getting his kiss was going to happen.  Although I didn't predict the German townsfolk would cheer when the American troops rolled into town, but that's just because that was so ridiculous.  Did the makers forget this was a German and not an occupied by German soldiers somewhere else in Europe town?  You're hardly going to be cheering on the enemy who would have just killed some of your family and friends, maybe just a couple of days ago or earlier in the war, especially when they would have heard the rumours or what was happening to Germans, especially women when the allied troops took other towns before them.  Perhaps they were cheering to try and lessen the chances of this happening to them but there really needed to be a scene explaining this.  How had Liesel survived up to their arrival in the period between their arrival and her foster parents being killed as well as her shelter being destroyed?  Did she live on the streets?  Someone else take her in?  I get she would have been looked after by the man she helped nurse in the basement when he returned but that would have been quite some time down the track.  Plus a little bit creepy of him to end up in a relationship with a child who was sort of like his sister and who he would have raised during the rest of her childhood.The Book Thief is a watchable film though, but it's no standout of the genre.  It just never seemed too real, lacked the tension a storyline like this should have had and just had the overwhelming feeling of dumbing it all down to be kid friendly.",3,"A Film For Little Kids, Set

1675850,A1L5WAZAL5H1SA,B00G15MDI0,Jon (Scott Reads It!),"[151, 168]","Note: I saw an advanced screening of The Book Thief.The Book Thief is a book that has stuck with me for so many years, there is just something so powerful and raw about Zusak's novel. The Book Thief has to be one of the trickiest books to adapt because it's far from a simple story. The novel is nearly 600 pages and it's main narrator is Death himself commenting on the events of World War II. How could Brian Percival (Downton Abbey) direct such a movie without doing the novel injustice?The Book Thief is true to it's source material, even though it doesn't maintain all of the major plot events in the novel. The filmmakers rarely utilized Death's narration, so the few times they did use it, it felt a bit awkward and out of place. I didn't get quite the chills from hearing his narration like I did when I had read the book. Despite the unevenness of the narration, The Book Thief really captures the essence of Liesel's story. All of the characters were truly perfectly cast, the dialogue is well done and the film truly captures all of the emotion from Zusak's novel.Sophie Nelisse is essentially a newcomer to Hollywood and this is her first major role in a movie. I really hope Nelisse wins an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance because it's absolutely unbelieveable. Nelisse's performance is absolutely unbelievable and it's clear to me that Nelisse is an extremely talented actress. Even though Nelisse shares screentime with veterans like Watson and Rush, Nelisse truly steals the show and easily makes viewers fall in love with Liesel.Both Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson did wonders in The Book Thief, they truly translated the characters from the book into their performances in a flawless manner. Rush and Watson became Rosa and Hans as if it was natural to them, like these parts were made for them.Rush and Nelisse are a duo that demands the viewers' attention and they truly make this a poignant movie. Their performances carry the film and bring The Book Thief to the next level. If neither Rush nor Nelisse receive Academy Award nominations for their performances, I'll truly be disappointed because their performances are something brilliant. I don't want to discredit Nico Liersch (Rudy) and Ben Schnetzer (Max) because their performances were also unbelieveable. I was just completely caught off guard by Rush, Nelisse, and Watson's extremely memorable acting.I'm not an extremely emotional movie viewer by any standard, I rarely am moved by movies. The Book Thief really captured me emotionally despite the fact that I knew what would happen next because I had read the book. Despite my knowledge of the plot, the actors fooled me into thinking that maybe it would end differently, maybe my heart wouldn't be stomped on. I was wrong, by the end of The Book Thief I was driven to tears by the movie's incredibly heartbreaking conclusion. I can't remember the last time I had cried this much during a movie, my head ached from crying so much over Zusak's characters.The Book Thief may not live up to Zusak's novel, but it is one of the best movies I have seen in years. The Book Thief provides an incredible, unique perspective of World War II from a whole new angle. This is the type of movie that will truly stay with viewers long after the credits roll, absolutely unforgettable.

1675854,A2RYXCJ91AQPS9,B00G15MDI0,judy,"[0, 0]","As I read the novel by author 'Markus Zusak' I was thrusted into the world of Liesel Meminger. A emotional connecting, solidly characterized, and powerfully written book. And right after finishing the book, I read that the film adaption had begun production. I was overjoyed to see an excellent tale of courage and friendship would come to life on the big screen. Unfortunately the film never showed at my Cinema when November 27th clocked in. So here I am, April 13th watching 'The Book Thief'. Was it all that I had hoped and prayed for, or what I have come to expect from film adaptions of my beloved books? I'd take the later, for this tale. My review of 'The Book Thief'.'The Book Thief' follows Liesel Meminger, a poor unfortunate girl who is thrusted into the hands of foster parents Hans and Rosa Hubermann (Played by Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson), after her mother was forced to abandon her and her late brother (who died on the way there), as she was a communist. Taking place from the beginning to the end of Hitler's rain, the film (Narrated by Death) tells Liesel's story of hope, courage, and her love for books.It's a very intriguing story, having it narrated by death. It doesn't take very long to realize this as the film's first line is 'You're all going to die.&#34; The narrating works to set up the characters and get you invested more as the film's opening is rather dull without the narration. The narration comes in short snippets throughout the film, until its closing monologue at the end, summing everything up. It's somewhat chilling and creepy, which is effective in a good way. But seems rather un-necessary altogether and is access weight to the film that already stretches past a bearable runtime, and instead leap farther into a slow 2 hours plus film.The film on a technical stand point is very strong. The visual effects are both beautiful and show loads of craftsmanship, what with the detail of everything imaginable, the snow and houses, it's all beautifully rendered with care.The film looks like a newly designed fabric. It's soft and pleasing to touch and hear and feel, and that's good and all, but it makes for a more comfy experience when the film tries to become serious, it just can't be taken that way. It try's dramatically to succeed but it doesn't, it's just too puppy like.The script has too much on its mind as well. It slacks often. When it's trying to be serious, it's not, and when it's trying to be funny, it's not. The script's dialogue is uninspired and cringworthy beyond be leaf for a film like this. The script winds up just slopping about, jumping us into random places, without any explanation.The film tries often, way too hard to be good, and instead falls on its head from exhaustion. Dramatically the film holds well, but it wears itself out from so much trying, it doesn't let itself just go with it. It follows the book well enough, but never adds what would be useful to successfully adapt the book to a feature length film.This may have been made up by the performances, and should have but it wasn't. The cast is fine, but wasn't enough to save the story from being a hopeless mess. 'Geoffrey Rush' shines as the lovably soft, foster father of Liesel, and so does 'Emily Watson' as the bittersweet, no-nonsense foster mother, with a heart hidden underneath all the sternness. Newcomer 'Sophie Nelisse' was brilliantly cast as our heroine, Liesel Meminger a brave and strong young girl.The score from 'John Williams' and the cinematography from 'Florian Ballhaus' both succeed to dramatically tone the film beautifully.All and all, 'The Book Thief' is visually beautiful, dramatically successful due to the strong score and cinematography, but the uninspired script pulls the film down from truly being good. C- 4/13/14'The Book Thief' is rated PG-13 for some intense violence. It's appropriate for children 12 and up.",2,Tries.... but fails.

First off, you have Geoffrey Rush, (the guy that did such a wonderful job portraying ""Wasingham"" in the ""Elizabeth"" movies, & the lead role in the ""King's Speech"") doing another superb character in this touching, compassionate, and revealing story of a European family during the 1930's/40's. If you like shows that have adolescent issues, adoption scenarios, or warm family situations, then this is a show you will want to own for repeated viewings.But this film also happens to be set with the world of Nazi-dominated Germany with all it's associated trappings.  It is not necessary to know everything about the period to enjoy this wonderful movie because the script is marvelously written, and has great narration to keep a non-history oriented viewer interested.  But for folks like me, that are well-read on the period, it is just flat-out GREAT!  I loved seeing the truth brought out this way.  This stuff really happened the way the Director plotted it out.Truth is, the girl in the lead role steals the show.  Sophie Nelisse is her name I think.  She is as talented as Elizabeth Taylor was.  Each facial expression, every moment she makes is just perfect as she ""ages"" in this tale that replicates the lives of so many good people that were caught in this maelstrom of evil that was the third Reich.  I had never heard of her before, but she must have done a lot of acting somewhere to be this good!The ""Mother"" role is that charming lady that played Rocky's new love interest in ""Rocky Balboa"", which I also liked much.  It is amazing how Emily Watson is able to alter the nature of her role in this show from a tough survivor true to the Germanic culture of the time, and yet be so very warm and likeable as she was in that good Stallone movie.I will watch this multiple times I am sure.  The music of the movie is as good as the sound track of ""Dr. Zhivago."" It just takes you back to this period of time when the world was so different than it is now, (well everywhere except in the Ukraine nation where history seems to be repeating itself currently.)This show has that ""magical"" feel about it, kinda like ""Gravity"" does by making the viewer feel that he is actually there with the actors.  Yet, it is not stark, or one dimensional ever.

1675937,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00G15MDI0,M. Oleson,"[2, 2]","Director Brian Percival brings Markus Zusak's novel to the big screen in a delicate and artful way.  The film is seen from the eyes of young Liesel (Sophie Neilsse in big blue-eyed performance) although ""Death"" (Roger Allam) is the occasional narrator.  That fact alone suggests that there will be an ominous tone to the story.  That and the setting is 1938 Nazi Germany.In a beautiful opening shot we see a speeding train negotiating the winter snowy countryside.  ""Death"" is guiding us to Liesel, her brother and her mother.  But on this day he is coming for the little boy.  After a hastily dug grave is dug alongside the tracks, a small book drops from the grave digger's pocket.  Liesel quickly scoops it up.  We learn later that Liesel's mother (Heike Makatsch) was taking the children to live with foster parents (and strangers) in a small village near Munich.  The mother is a Communist sympathizer and is therefore protecting her children by giving them away.Hans Hubermann (Jeffrey Rush) and his wife Rosa (Emily Watson) are the childless couple that adopt the young girl, essentially to collect a stipend from the government.  Both are self-employed.  Hans, a painter and Rosa does laundry.  Hans quickly warms up to the girl, grumpy Rosa not so much at first.  She's upset in that she was expecting 2 children.  Hans's retorts something to the effect that it's not Liesel's fault her brother died.Liesel catches the eye of another 12 year old, a boy named Rudy (Nico Liersch) who lives next door.  At school on her first day, we learn Liesel is illiterate.  Rudy and Liesel become best friends and defend each other throughout the movie, both verbally and physically.  With the Nazi purge underway, the Hubermann's reluctantly take in a young man of about 19 or 20.  He's Max Vandenburg, the son of a Jewish soldier who saved Hans's life in World War I.  Hans had promised him as he died, he would look after his son if and when the time came.  It did and he did.Hans, recognizing Liesel's reading shortcomings teaches her and she quickly learns.  Her hunger to read is so profound, she ""borrows"" books from the burgermeister's wife.  Max creates a dictionary of sorts on the walls of the basement.  She adds new words in chalk as she learns them.  Max, being hidden in the basement, becomes a great friend and inspiration of Liesel's, teaching her how to describe in detail what she sees.  These are some great scenes.I've seen some criticisms of the film that it doesn't graphically depict the horrors of the Nazi's.  I would argue that it is indeed shown, but that every movie about this period doesn't have to be ""Schindler's List.""  And not every German agreed with Hitler.  I would agree that the ""Death"" narration gives the film a sense of fantasy and perhaps a less serious tone.  But ""Death"" does show up in full catch-up mode in the film's final act.  I found it to be a poignant, touching ending that at first will have you pushing away a tear but ultimately is one of profound joy.When a few years pass and Liesel reunites with Max, we're are left to guess what happens to him, but I've written my own ending which is what I expect the writers wanted.  This is an excellent film, perhaps a bit slow at times and a little long.  But it is beautifully shot, well directed and includes some superior acting from Watson, Rush and young Sophie Nelisse.  You'll be hearing more from her.  John Williams provides a gorgeous score.  Highly recommended.The Blu ray transfer comes with a 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  It is just about as good as it gets.  There is a wide range of dimensions in the film that going from the opening snowy scene to the drab and dingy Hubermann basement.  It comes across perfectly with excellent contrast and detail.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is equally excellent.  Like the video, the audio components range from relative quiet village streets to massive bombing attacks by the Allies.  It is all properly rendered throughout the soundfield as is the excellent Williams score.  Subtitles are numerous including English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Arabic, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Estonian, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Icelandic, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, Romanian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Turkish, Ukrainian.  Extras include: Deleted Scenes (1080p; 6:34) and A Hidden Truth: Bringing The Book Thief to Life (1080p; 31:05) and a trailer.",4,(BLU RAY REVIEW) 4 1/2 stars for an excellent adaptation and a star-making performance,1404000000,"06 29, 2014",2014,4429,"['Director', 'Brian', 'Percival', 'Markus', 'Zusak', 'novel', 'big', 'screen', 'delicate', 'artful', 'way', 'film', 'seen', 'eyes', 'young', 'Liesel', 'Sophie', 'Neilsse', 'big', 'blue-eyed', 'performance', 'Death', 'Roger', 'Allam', 'occasional', 'narrator', 'fact', 'alone', 'will', 'be', 'ominous', 'tone', 'story', 'setting', '1938', 'Nazi', 'Germany.In', 'beautiful', 'opening', 'shot', 'see', 'speeding', 'train', 'negotiating', 'winter', 'snowy', 'countryside', 'Death', 'guiding', 'Liesel', 'brother', 'mother', 'day', 'coming', 'little', 'boy', 'hastily', 'dug', 'grave', 'dug', 'tracks', 'small', 'book', 'drops', 'grave', 'digger', 'pocket', 'Liesel', 'quickly', 'up', 'learn', 'later', 'Liesel', 'mother', 'Heike', 'Makatsch', 'was', 'taking', 'children', 'live', 'foster', 'parents', 'strangers', 'small', 'village', 'Munich', 'mother', 'Communist', 'sympathizer', 'therefore', 'protecting', 'children', 'giving', 'away.Hans', 'Hubermann', 'Jeffrey', 'Rush', 'wife', 'Rosa', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'are', 'childless', 'couple', 'young', 'girl', 'essentially', 'collect', 'stipend', 'government', 'are', 'self-employed', 'Hans', 'painter', 'Rosa', 'laundry', 'Hans', 'quickly', 'up', 'girl', 'grumpy', 'Rosa', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'first', 'upset', 'was', 'expecting', '2', 'children', 'Hans', 'retorts', 'something', 'effect', 'not', 'Liesel', 'fault', 'brother', 'died.Liesel', 'eye', '12', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'named', 'Rudy', 'Nico', 'Liersch', 'who', 'next', 'door', 'school', 'first', 'day', 'learn', 'Liesel', 'illiterate', 'Rudy', 'Liesel', 'become', 'best', 'friends', 'defend', 'other', 'movie', 'verbally', 'physically', 'Nazi', 'purge', 'underway', 'Hubermann', 'reluctantly', 'take', 'young', 'man', '19', '20', 'Max', 'Vandenburg', 'son', 'Jewish', 'soldier', 'who', 'saved', 'Hans', 'life', 'World', 'War', 'I.', 'Hans', 'had', 'promised', 'died', 'would', 'look', 'son', 'when', 'time', 'came', 'did', 'recognizing', 'Liesel', 'reading', 'shortcomings', 'quickly', 'hunger', 'read', 'so', 'profound', 'borrows', 'books', 'burgermeister', 'wife', 'Max', 'dictionary', 'sorts', 'walls', 'basement', 'new', 'words', 'chalk', 'Max', 'being', 'hidden', 'basement', 'great', 'friend', 'inspiration', 'Liesel', 'teaching', 'how', 'describe', 'detail', 'what', 'are', 'great', 'scenes.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'criticisms', 'film', ""n't"", 'graphically', 'depict', 'horrors', 'Nazi', 'would', 'argue', 'indeed', 'shown', 'movie', 'period', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'Schindler', 'List', 'not', 'German', 'agreed', 'Hitler', 'would', 'agree', 'Death', 'narration', 'film', 'sense', 'fantasy', 'perhaps', 'less', 'serious', 'tone', 'Death', 'show', 'up', 'full', 'catch-up', 'mode', 'film', 'final', 'act', 'found', 'be', 'poignant', 'touching', 'ending', 'first', 'will', 'have', 'pushing', 'away', 'tear', 'ultimately', 'one', 'profound', 'joy.When', 'few', 'years', 'pass', 'Liesel', 'Max', ""'re"", 'are', 'left', 'guess', 'what', ""'ve"", 'written', 'own', 'ending', 'what', 'expect', 'writers', 'wanted', 'excellent', 'film', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'slow', 'times', 'little', 'long', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'well', 'directed', 'superior', 'acting', 'Watson', 'Rush', 'young', 'Sophie', 'Nelisse', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hearing', 'more', 'John', 'Williams', 'gorgeous', 'score', 'Highly', 'recommended.The', 'Blu', 'ray', 'transfer', '1080p', 'resolution', '2.40:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'just', 'about', 'as', 'good', 'wide', 'range', 'dimensions', 'film', 'going', 'opening', 'snowy', 'scene', 'drab', 'dingy', 'Hubermann', 'basement', 'perfectly', 'excellent', 'contrast', 'detail', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'track', 'equally', 'excellent', 'video', 'audio', 'components', 'range', 'relative', 'quiet', 'village', 'streets', 'massive', 'bombing', 'attacks', 'Allies', 'properly', 'rendered', 'soundfield', 'excellent', 'Williams', 'score', 'Subtitles', 'are', 'numerous', 'including', 'English', 'SDH', 'French', 'Spanish', 'Portuguese', 'German', 'Arabic', 'Bulgarian', 'Croatian', 'Czech', 'Estonian', 'Greek', 'Hebrew', 'Hungarian', 'Icelandic', 'Latvian', 'Lithuanian', 'Polish', 'Romanian', 'Serbian', 'Slovak', 'Slovenian', 'Turkish', 'Ukrainian', 'Extras', 'include', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', '1080p', '6:34', 'A', 'Hidden', 'Truth', 'Bringing', 'Book', 'Thief', 'Life', '1080p', '31:05', 'trailer']",N/A

1675960,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B00G15MDI0,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[3, 9]","There is a moving, beautifully-filmed story about a handsome young German girl struggling for her life, and to come of age, through an unlikely bond with a young Jewish refugee during the death throes of the Third Reich. This isn&#8217;t it.That film is Cate Shortland&#8217;s remarkable Lore (2012), and if you haven&#8217;t seen it, you should.About this film, which also concerns an orphaned German girl coming of age through a relationship with a young Jewish refugee in the dying days of the Reich, I&#8217;m not so sure. Director Brian Percival &#8211; he of Downton Abbey &#8211; paints by numbers, and his scriptwriter Michael Petroni has a tin ear for dialogue.The opening aerial shot, swooping in over a layer of cloud, is trite enough to be a studio logo animation. As we dive through the cloud to track a steam train puffing excitedly through snow-bound countryside, one could be forgiven for deducing a Harry Potter instalment. But no: Roger Allam&#8217;s mellifluous baritone fills the soundstage and we are underway. Allam is the unseen voice of Death, and he intercedes periodically through the two and a quarter hours of this film to tell slow witted viewers what is going on.Yet Allam&#8217;s dialogue is aspirationally coherent and not actually meaningful. If you let his velvet gravel, John Williams&#8217; lachrymose music and Florian Ballhaus&#8217; luscious images do their work, you may switch off altogether and still get the gist.The gist comes through loud and clear elsewhere: 10 year-old Liesl, (Sophie N&eacute;lisse) has been orphaned and comes to live with Hans (Geoffrey Rush) and Rosa (Emily Watson), of whom Hans is warm and kind, and Rosa cold, practical, and interested only in the money she will earn from fostering. They wind up sheltering handsome young Jewish refugee Max (Ben Schnetzer), and everything else proceeds exactly as you would expect had you any experience with this sort of story (The Diary of Anne Frank, Schindler&#8217;s List, and so on), only without any edge or challenge to expectations. Petroni&#8217;s awful dialogue affords the cast no scope to practice their craft and the viewer no need to practice inference. Instead, through wholly artificial dialogue delivered in cod German accents, which lapse for easy words into actual German (nein, ich bin nacht kidding) the screenplay beats us over the head with every plot development.The actors, accordingly, flounder. Rush is as good a character actor as you&#8217;ll find these days, and he works a small miracle breathing life into Hans. Watson singularly fails to animate Rosa, and with their tender years the two child leads, N&eacute;lisse, and Rudi (the exceedingly Aryan-looking Nico Liersch) have no chance. N&eacute;lisse is an engaging personality, and may go far, but at 11 she was a few years young for this to generate the sort of vertiginous pubescent tension of Lore: Hannelore (15, but played by 18 year-old Saskia Rosendahl) is truculent, nuanced, vulnerable and organic. Liesl is (by necessity) wide-eyed and saccharine, though she does give one of her classmates a good kicking early on.(Contains spoilers)Thereafter the screenplay pulls punches it should have thrown heartily: despite being threatened, Liesl&#8217;s basement secret is never discovered. Nor is her book-thievery. Max is not captured. Despite being selected and threatening to run away, Rudy never gets sent to military training, and while Hans does get conscripted, before long he&#8217;s home again nursing nothing more than a limp and percussion deafness in one ear. A book burning is portrayed rather like a glum Guy Fawkes&#8217; night. Even Kristallnacht is sanitised. Max reaches death&#8217;s door from fever a couple of times but, after some mawkish scenes, is turned away each time.(End of spoilers).Thus the long middle of the film stumbles around like a blind man in a dark room who keeps walking into cupboards. Eventually he finds his way out, courtesy of a ten-ton weight unprompted by any of the dramatic devices or character arcs that have been carefully established, but by this stage &#8211; over two hours in &#8211; this reviewer's patience had long since been exhausted.Olly Buxton",2,Not a patch on Cate Shortland's Lore,1393977600,"03 5, 2014",2014,4200,"['moving', 'beautifully-filmed', 'story', 'handsome', 'young', 'German', 'girl', 'struggling', 'life', 'come', 'age', 'unlikely', 'bond', 'young', 'Jewish', 'refugee', 'death', 'throes', 'Third', 'Reich', 'isn', '8217', 'film', 'Cate', 'Shortland', '8217', 'remarkable', 'Lore', '2012', 'haven', '8217', 'seen', 'should.About', 'film', 'also', 'orphaned', 'German', 'girl', 'coming', 'age', 'relationship', 'young', 'Jewish', 'refugee', 'dying', 'days', 'Reich', '8217', 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'Director', 'Brian', 'Percival', '8211', 'Downton', 'Abbey', '8211', 'paints', 'numbers', 'scriptwriter', 'Michael', 'Petroni', 'tin', 'ear', 'dialogue.The', 'opening', 'aerial', 'shot', 'swooping', 'layer', 'cloud', 'trite', 'enough', 'be', 'studio', 'logo', 'animation', 'dive', 'cloud', 'track', 'steam', 'train', 'puffing', 'excitedly', 'snow-bound', 'countryside', 'one', 'could', 'be', 'forgiven', 'deducing', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'instalment', 'Roger', 'Allam', '8217', 'mellifluous', 'baritone', 'soundstage', 'are', 'underway', 'Allam', 'unseen', 'voice', 'Death', 'periodically', 'two', 'quarter', 'hours', 'film', 'tell', 'slow', 'witted', 'viewers', 'what', 'going', 'on.Yet', 'Allam', '8217', 'dialogue', 'aspirationally', 'coherent', 'not', 'actually', 'meaningful', 'let', 'velvet', 'gravel', 'John', 'Williams', '8217', 'lachrymose', 'music', 'Florian', 'Ballhaus', '8217', 'luscious', 'images', 'do', 'work', 'may', 'switch', 'off', 'still', 'get', 'gist.The', 'gist', 'loud', 'clear', 'elsewhere', '10', 'year-old', 'Liesl', 'Sophie', 'N', 'eacute', 'lisse', 'been', 'orphaned', 'live', 'Hans', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Rosa', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'whom', 'Hans', 'warm', 'kind', 'Rosa', 'cold', 'practical', 'interested', 'only', 'money', 'will', 'earn', 'fostering', 'wind', 'up', 'sheltering', 'handsome', 'young', 'Jewish', 'refugee', 'Max', 'Ben', 'Schnetzer', 'everything', 'else', 'exactly', 'would', 'expect', 'had', 'experience', 'sort', 'story', 'Diary', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'Schindler', '8217', 's', 'List', 'so', 'only', 'edge', 'challenge', 'expectations', 'Petroni', '8217', 'awful', 'dialogue', 'cast', 'scope', 'practice', 'craft', 'viewer', 'need', 'practice', 'inference', 'Instead', 'wholly', 'artificial', 'dialogue', 'delivered', 'cod', 'German', 'accents', 'lapse', 'easy', 'words', 'actual', 'German', 'nein', 'ich', 'bin', 'kidding', 'screenplay', 'head', 'plot', 'development.The', 'actors', 'accordingly', 'flounder', 'Rush', 'as', 'good', 'character', 'actor', '8217', 'find', 'days', 'small', 'miracle', 'breathing', 'life', 'Hans', 'Watson', 'singularly', 'animate', 'Rosa', 'tender', 'years', 'two', 'child', 'leads', 'N', 'eacute', 'Rudi', 'exceedingly', 'Aryan-looking', 'Nico', 'Liersch', 'have', 'chance', 'N', 'eacute', 'engaging', 'personality', 'may', 'go', 'far', '11', 'was', 'few', 'years', 'young', 'generate', 'sort', 'vertiginous', 'pubescent', 'tension', 'Lore', 'Hannelore', '15', 'played', '18', 'year-old', 'Saskia', 'Rosendahl', 'truculent', 'nuanced', 'vulnerable', 'organic', 'Liesl', 'necessity', 'wide-eyed', 'saccharine', 'give', 'one', 'classmates', 'good', 'kicking', 'early', 'Contains', 'spoilers', 'Thereafter', 'screenplay', 'punches', 'should', 'have', 'thrown', 'heartily', 'being', 'threatened', 'Liesl', '8217', 'basement', 'secret', 'never', 'discovered', 'book-thievery', 'Max', 'not', 'captured', 'being', 'selected', 'threatening', 'run', 'away', 'Rudy', 'never', 'sent', 'military', 'training', 'Hans', 'get', 'conscripted', 'long', '8217', 'home', 'again', 'nursing', 'nothing', 'more', 'limp', 'percussion', 'deafness', 'one', 'ear', 'book', 'burning', 'portrayed', 'rather', 'glum', 'Guy', 'Fawkes', '8217', 'night', 'Even', 'Kristallnacht', 'sanitised', 'Max', 'death', '8217', 's', 'door', 'fever', 'couple', 'times', 'mawkish', 'scenes', 'turned', 'away', 'time', 'End', 'spoilers', '.Thus', 'long', 'middle', 'film', 'blind', 'man', 'dark', 'room', 'who', 'walking', 'cupboards', 'Eventually', 'way', 'courtesy', 'ten-ton', 'weight', 'unprompted', 'dramatic', 'devices', 'character', 'arcs', 'have', 'been', 'carefully', 'established', 'stage', '8211', 'two', 'hours', '8211', 'reviewer', 'patience', 'had', 'long', 'been', 'exhausted.Olly', 'Buxton']",N/A
1675961,A2T0VGJ374LUZ0,B00G15MDI0,"Ornery, Swaggering, Piece of work","[0, 0]","I loved The Book Thief.  Here's some reasons why:Casting is VERY good.  In particular, Sophie N&eacute;lisse and Nico Liersch, who play Liesel and Rudy.  Both have excellent acting skills, especially for being so young.  They are perfect.  Of course, the rest of the cast is good as well, with Geoffrey Rush as Hans, Emily Watson as Rosa, and some others whose names I forget.  The only actor I slightly objected to was Ben Schnetzer, who played Max.  I think they could have done a little better. Still, not too far off.I really enjoy the subtlety of the acting.  Nothing is more distracting than having even just one actor over-acting.  I didn't feel that way about any of the characters, which was great.  Not that they were boring or unemotional; they are anything but boring, and show emotion where they should.Of course, the story is wonderfull.  Here the credit goes to both Marcus Zusak for writing the book, and whoever translated it into movie form.  It came off as true the original book, with a few minor alterations.  Alterations include changing who says what line, or the title of a book Liesel read.I only have two small complaints.  First, I didn't like the narrator's (death's) voice.  It sounds too much like the usual creepy voice that we attribute to death.  It goes against the different character that Zusak gave to Death.  Second, I wish they had included more Liesel and Rudy's stealing trips.  But that's it!The Book Thief is really, really good.

As the movie opens, Death (in a voice over) cautions the audience &#34;one small fact: you are going to die&#34;, and with that we are filled with a pending doom and gloom about what is to happen. The stage is Nazi-Germany, February 1938, and we are introduced to Liesel, a young girl (9 or 10 yrs. old) who has just lost her younger brother to (unspecified) sickness as they are being transported to their new foster family. Liesel's foster mom Rosa is as tough a cookie as her foster dad Hans is as sweet a man you'll ever meet (he calls Liesel &#34;your majesty&#34; to make her feel welcome). Liesel befriends Rudi, a boy on her street, and soon they become best friends. Foster dad Hans teaches Liesel to read, which opens a new world for Liesel and she eagerly snaps up the opportunity to explore new books. Then Kristallnacht (&#34;night of the broker glass&#34;) takes place and Max, a Jewish young man whose dad once saved Hans' life, takes refuge in the home of Hans, Rosa and Liesel. At this point we are about 40 min. into the movie. Will Liesel ever see her real mom again? Will Max survive the years of hiding? What becomes of Liesel and Rudi? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this is a very careful/faithful adaptation of the novel, as directed by pretty much unknown UK director Brian Percival. If there is one complaint that I may have about the movie, it is that pretty much every scene feels very much staged (which of course they are), almost like we're watching a theatre production and not a movie. Second, the acting performances are top-notch, with Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson as the loving foster parents, but the real revelation is the young Canadian actress Sophie N&eacute;lisse, in the role of Liesel. N&eacute;lisse had previously appeared in last year's excellent (and Oscar-nominated) Canadian film &#34;Monsieur Lazhar&#34;. In this movie she radiates such presence on the big screen that she almost blows everyone else away. Third, the movie features an excellent soundtrack, by none other than the legendary John Williams, in one of his rare non-Steven Spielberg movie efforts (I couldn't help but think that in fact &#34;The Book Thief&#34; feels like it could've been made by Spielberg). Last, be sure to bring a Kleenex tissue with you, as chances are that you will need it.I had seen the trailer of this a few times in recent weeks and was looking forward to seeing this. The movie opened this weekend at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati. When I went to see it last night (a weekday night), I was pleasantly surprised how well attended it was.

1675981,A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q,B00G15MDI0,Ranny Levy,"[4, 5]","This is an incredible film based on the book by the same name. It follows the life of a young girl who is abandoned by her mother and placed in foster care with a couple who also take in a young Jewish man who puts the entire family at risk. It give us a glimpse of what life might have been like for children similar to this during the time the Nazi party controlled Germany. At times terrifying, at times humorous, it will surely give you a full range of emotions. The production is simply stunning from the first rate performances to the sets that portray a very realistic image of this small German town. Young Sophie Nelisse plays a very believable character as the young girl, Liesel and Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson, the adoptive parents, are equally believable.I know that this book is required reading for many middle schoolers and would highly recommend that they watch this film as well. It portrays so well life in 1938 Germany from the Hitler youth groups to the book burning, the anti-Jewish propaganda, and the brainwashing that ordinary people endured.  It certainly opens up for discussion why all of these people bought into the Nazi regime.Youth comments: Out of all the movies I've ever seen, this one is the saddest. &#34;The Book Thief&#34; is a fantastic film that would make everyone who sees it cry, laugh, enjoy and be at the edge of their seats.  This movie has so much to watch - a tiny bit of comedy, sadness, history, suspense, thrilling scenes, intense, a bit of violence and, of course, theft.The story begins when a young girl is on her way with her sick brother to live with a new family. Sadly, the brother dies along the way. The girl is left alone with a new mother, a new father and stuck in Germany during World War II. Her family does a lot of scary things and it's a very sad story as well.The movie has so much history. I am Jewish so I cried quite a lot when I watched it. The facts are very accurate and very well done. The actors are stupendous. They are sad, happy, scared, brave and a lot more. The special affects and the thrilling way this film is done is amazing. This film is one of those films that made me cry. I wanted to go back in time so I could change Hitler's childhood to convince him to be nicer, kinder and not kill people. This movie is definitely big, intense and memorable.My favorite scene is a happy one. The family is hiding a Jew in their basement. The father (Geoffrey Rush) is a bit of a goof so he gets a lot of snow and they start a snow fight in the basement. For once, the mother plays along, and the girl builds a snow man. There they are huddled against each other, listening to the father play an accordion and feeling happy despite what is happening in the outside world. Because the movie is so intense, I recommend it for ages 11 to 18. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and would recommend that everyone watch this film and think about what happened in the past.

1676009,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B00G15MDI0,Sean Pasek,"[3, 4]","""The Book Thief"" is one of the most powerfully heartfelt films to come down the pike in recent years.  There are some films that stay with you long after the credits have run their course.  For hours, and perhaps even days, you find that you can't think of much else.  These are the movies that stay with you forever.  I have literally seen several thousand movies in my 42 years of life, but I can only think of a handful that I would consider memorable enough to stay permanently etched upon my heart.  This is one of those films.The story takes place during World War II, and interestingly enough, it is narrated by Death.  Death observes the strange behavior of humans and observes that the only certainty in life is that everyone dies.  No one can avoid it, and yet some people spend a lifetime dwelling upon it. War affects everyone.  It doesn't matter which ""side"" you're on.  The reality of war is no one is left untouched by it.  Death, of course, does not discriminate.""The Book Thief"" tells the story of Liesel, a precociously beautiful girl who finds herself being left by her mother with a couple in a small German town.  She doesn't understand why her mother gave her up, and she finds her new mother to be like a ""thunderstorm,"" and a father who has a warm and gentle heart.We find that Liesel has no formal education, and she is laughed at by her peers at school for being unable to read or write.  Her only book in her possession is about grave-digging.  However, she quickly finds solace and a joy in words.  Her father encourages her to develop a love for reading and writing.  A large wall in the basement with the letters of the alphabet are designed for her to write any new words she finds in books which she has developed a voracious appetite for.As Nazi Germany quickly takes control of the town, a young Jewish man, named Max, hides with the family.  Liesel is quickly fascinated by the newcomer, and she develops a loving friendship with him.  Upon learning of Liesel's love for books, Max explains to her that words are life.Liesel also develops a friendship with Rudy, the first person to truly welcome Liesel to her new home and her new town.  It's obvious that Rudy has quickly fallen in love with Liesel, and the budding friendship is truly beautiful to behold.Liesel lives in a world dominated by a political machine that encourages book-burning, hatred toward ""inferior"" people, and oppression by the military.  She doesn't understand it, and she quickly finds a growing distaste and bitterness toward it.  Her greatest fear is that she may one day lose all of those whom she loves.  Sometimes we forget that not everyone in Germany supported Nazism and that there were plenty of people who tried their best to help those who were oppressed and abused.Geoffrey Rush is fantastic as Hans.  He is one my favorite actors, and he never disappoints.  He plays Hans with such warmth and depth.  It becomes quickly clear that he adores Liesel, and he showers her with that love.Emily Watson is equally good as Rosa.  She's a hard woman who seems exactly as Liesel describes her: a thunderstorm, but we also quickly realize that Rosa has a heart of gold, despite her complaints and the constant berating of Hans and Liesel.  Rosa is trying to keep some organization of her home, and it's obvious that she fears what may eventually happen to them all.However, this film really belongs to Sophie Nelisse.  This young girl has a bright future ahead of her.  I've always observed that the finest actors can act without saying a word, and Sophie does this remarkably well.  She is able to capture Liesel's innocence, a sense of naivety, and intelligence with a simple look.  Those blue eyes seem able to light up a room as well as everyone around her.  Sophie gives us that type of character in Liesel.  Death states that he is ""haunted by humans,"" and the irony is that it is obvious that he is haunted by Liesel and her purity of heart and timeless grace.  After watching this film, the audience can't help but share in that feeling.The story and the cast are first-rate.  I really don't know how anyone can watch this film and not be moved by it as well as being completely captivated by Liesel.  I am certainly captivated by her; so much so that I am already more than eager for another viewing!Movies like this one are rare, and I am always so appreciative that films like this one are being made.  Indeed, I find myself haunted by them.",5,"""The Book Thief"" (And Sophie Nelisse!)

1676014,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B00G15MDI0,Sheryl Fechter,"[3, 4]","The story of 'The Book Thief' begins on a train, steaming its way through the snow laden countryside, just after an eyeopening monologue from the narrator, 'Death' (voice of Roger Allam). He so carefully reminds us that we are all going to die then proceeds to take young Liesel's (Sophie Nelisse) brother away.  Her mother sits crying while holding his lifeless form until the train makes a stop to bury the boy alongside the tracks. After her brother passes on, Liesel takes a book that fell from him at the burial site. This will be the first of many that Liesel will take, borrow, steal, and do just about anything for.  Due to the unknown reason that her mother cannot take care of her any longer, and her brother is now gone, Liesel is all alone. She does safely arrive at the home of her new parents, Hans (Geoffrey Rush) and Rosa (Emily Watson) Hubermann, during the winter of 1938. The director (Brian Percival) weaves a multilayered, character driven, tapestry of loss, life, and love in Germany during wartime.  It is easy to see in several places how this tale is told through the child's eyes.  Add to this wide-eyed precious daughter, a gentle and loving father who is devoted to her, and there is a richer depth which is all the more unique for the telling.Hans is immediately smitten with his new daughter upon her arrival, calling her ""Your Majesty"" to coax her out of the car and later adding ""Princess"" to her pet names.  Rosa, being the stricter of the couple, sets the rules quickly on how they are to be addressed; Mama and Papa, to use proper manners, and how long she can be running around playing with her friend Rudy Steiner (Nico Liersch). Some crucial stabile, however never smooth, time goes by as the small family settles in.  Some extremely harrowing situations take their turn at bat too.  Liesel wears a uniform like all of the other children, including the swastikas.  They look almost like a military youth brigade as they stand and sing Germany's song in Germanic, with the words on the bottom of the screen for the full affect.  I had neither heard nor read those lyrics before viewing the film; they sickened me as much as the hanging swastikas plastered on flags that they were in front of.  Then the family had to attend a book-burning type of gathering, the sight of this alone was horrific.Once again, the book thief struck, and Liesel gains another work for her interesting collection from this cruel conjuncture.  She saves a smoldering textbook left from the fire while Max (Ben Schnetzer), a young Jewish family friend, moves into the Hubermann's basement from his hiding place.  Liesel and Max have wonderful conversations about what their individual lives have been like.  Max teaches Liesel that her words mean everything, and they can take her anywhere while things just get worse surrounding everyone.  This family has to try to make anything pleasing or there would be nothing whatsoever left.  They spent one particular Christmas making it completely special, being cheerful and happy.  They all try to make something out of very little.  When they can get Rosa involved, well, I guess they are really doing well.  Like Liesel says about her mother, ""She is like a thunderstorm because she rumbles all of the time"".There are several times Death makes comments about what is happening, or what he is doing in the story at that point. I thought the way they represented him in this film was extremely original.  He doesn't take on a necessarily ominous tone or otherworldly countenance, only a talking presence while his words can teach at the same time.  He speaks his own truths and is another character in the movie, not fully fleshed out although. I thought for Death to be out in his full invisible form, nondimensional, and with a personality was brilliant in the script. I certainly found this movie's heart was in its relationships, one character to another.  Hans explaining to Liesel that he has trouble reading too therefore they could learn together.  A point where Rosa and Hans' accordion were inseparable. ""The Book Thief"" is scored beautifully (John Williams).  It swells and fills in any spaces that need something lovely.  The cinematography (Florian Ballhaus) is breathtaking; The opening scene with the train going across a snow mantled countryside is a beautiful example of the photography.  An all around wonderful movie that takes you through every emotion and leaves without a dry eye in the house.",5,"""I Don't Know What It Was About Liesel Meminger, But She Caught Me,  And I Cared"" - Death",1396137600,"03 30, 2014",2014,4473,"['story', ""'The"", 'Book', 'Thief', 'begins', 'train', 'steaming', 'way', 'snow', 'laden', 'countryside', 'just', 'eyeopening', 'monologue', 'narrator', 'voice', 'Roger', 'Allam', 'so', 'carefully', 'are', 'going', 'die', 'then', 'proceeds', 'take', 'young', 'Liesel', 'Sophie', 'Nelisse', 'away', 'mother', 'sits', 'crying', 'holding', 'lifeless', 'form', 'train', 'stop', 'bury', 'boy', 'tracks', 'brother', 'passes', 'Liesel', 'book', 'fell', 'burial', 'site', 'will', 'be', 'first', 'many', 'Liesel', 'will', 'take', 'borrow', 'steal', 'do', 'just', 'anything', 'Due', 'unknown', 'reason', 'mother', 'can', 'not', 'take', 'care', 'longer', 'brother', 'now', 'gone', 'Liesel', 'alone', 'safely', 'arrive', 'home', 'new', 'parents', 'Hans', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Rosa', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'Hubermann', 'winter', '1938', 'director', 'Brian', 'Percival', 'multilayered', 'character', 'driven', 'tapestry', 'loss', 'life', 'love', 'Germany', 'wartime', 'easy', 'see', 'several', 'places', 'how', 'tale', 'told', 'child', 'eyes', 'Add', 'wide-eyed', 'precious', 'daughter', 'gentle', 'loving', 'father', 'who', 'devoted', 'richer', 'depth', 'more', 'unique', 'telling.Hans', 'immediately', 'smitten', 'new', 'daughter', 'arrival', 'calling', 'Majesty', 'coax', 'car', 'later', 'adding', 'Princess', 'pet', 'names', 'Rosa', 'being', 'stricter', 'couple', 'rules', 'quickly', 'how', 'are', 'be', 'addressed', 'Mama', 'Papa', 'use', 'proper', 'manners', 'how', 'long', 'can', 'be', 'running', 'playing', 'friend', 'Rudy', 'Steiner', 'Nico', 'Liersch', 'crucial', 'stabile', 'however', 'never', 'smooth', 'time', 'small', 'family', 'settles', 'extremely', 'harrowing', 'situations', 'take', 'turn', 'bat', 'too', 'Liesel', 'uniform', 'other', 'children', 'including', 'swastikas', 'look', 'almost', 'military', 'youth', 'brigade', 'stand', 'sing', 'Germany', 'song', 'Germanic', 'words', 'bottom', 'screen', 'full', 'affect', 'had', 'heard', 'read', 'lyrics', 'viewing', 'film', 'sickened', 'as', 'much', 'hanging', 'swastikas', 'plastered', 'flags', 'were', 'front', 'Then', 'family', 'had', 'attend', 'book-burning', 'type', 'gathering', 'sight', 'alone', 'was', 'horrific.Once', 'again', 'book', 'thief', 'struck', 'Liesel', 'gains', 'work', 'interesting', 'collection', 'cruel', 'conjuncture', 'smoldering', 'textbook', 'left', 'fire', 'Max', 'Ben', 'Schnetzer', 'young', 'Jewish', 'family', 'friend', 'moves', 'Hubermann', 'basement', 'hiding', 'place', 'Liesel', 'Max', 'have', 'wonderful', 'conversations', 'what', 'individual', 'lives', 'have', 'been', 'Max', 'Liesel', 'words', 'mean', 'everything', 'can', 'take', 'anywhere', 'things', 'just', 'get', 'worse', 'surrounding', 'everyone', 'family', 'try', 'make', 'anything', 'pleasing', 'would', 'be', 'nothing', 'whatsoever', 'left', 'spent', 'one', 'particular', 'Christmas', 'making', 'completely', 'special', 'being', 'cheerful', 'happy', 'try', 'make', 'something', 'very', 'little', 'When', 'can', 'get', 'Rosa', 'involved', 'well', 'guess', 'are', 'really', 'doing', 'well', 'Liesel', 'mother', 'thunderstorm', 'time', 'are', 'several', 'times', 'Death', 'comments', 'what', 'happening', 'what', 'doing', 'story', 'point', 'thought', 'way', 'represented', 'film', 'was', 'extremely', 'original', ""n't"", 'take', 'necessarily', 'ominous', 'tone', 'otherworldly', 'countenance', 'only', 'talking', 'presence', 'words', 'can', 'teach', 'same', 'time', 'own', 'truths', 'character', 'movie', 'not', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'thought', 'Death', 'be', 'out', 'full', 'invisible', 'form', 'nondimensional', 'personality', 'was', 'brilliant', 'script', 'certainly', 'found', 'movie', 'heart', 'was', 'relationships', 'one', 'character', 'Hans', 'explaining', 'Liesel', 'trouble', 'reading', 'too', 'therefore', 'could', 'learn', 'together', 'point', 'where', 'Rosa', 'Hans', 'accordion', 'were', 'inseparable', 'Book', 'Thief', 'scored', 'beautifully', 'John', 'Williams', 'fills', 'spaces', 'need', 'something', 'lovely', 'cinematography', 'Florian', 'Ballhaus', 'breathtaking', 'opening', 'scene', 'train', 'going', 'snow', 'mantled', 'countryside', 'beautiful', 'example', 'photography', 'around', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'emotion', 'dry', 'eye', 'house']",N/A

I'm reminded of anne of green gables in that anne was of similar age, temperament and position in life to this heroine, but anne was much more clearly developed than the character here. part of the problem I think is that she just appears on the train, not enough information about her, her family or her life before she reaches her foster parents. she is a pleasant character but is always abit distant; we're not really attached to her. apparently the screenwriter didn't know he/she needed to do that. when we first met her there is the death voice over, which is not a strong attaching feature, and then she's screaming at the discovery of her little brother's death. I think the story needed a better, and different, introduction to her for us to get a sense of who she is as a person.overall, okay story. best elements are the german couple's characterizations, though not really believable that the Frau would go to the school to inform the heroine that Max was recovering - previous characterization of the Frau didn't support her effusiveness up to that point, so screenwriter needed to fix that. acting by Emma and Jeffery was great as usual",3,world war II from an adolescent perspective (SPOILERS)...,1398816000,"04 30, 2014",2014,2290,"['war', 'loss', 'friendship', 'love', 'ethical', 'choices', 'witnessing', 'antisemitism', 'costs', 'loved', 'ones', 'are', 'experiences', 'pre-teen', 'heroine', 'story', 'girl', 'who', 'fostered', 'ethical', 'german', 'couple', 'who', 'grow', 'love', 'who', 'love', 'kindness', 'midst', 'tragedy', 'nicely', 'acted.did', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'death', 'voice', 'over.school', 'experiences', 'pretty', 'standard', 'i.e', 'ubiquitous', 'bully', 'written/directed', 'pedestrian', 'uninteresting', 'way', 'liked', 'seeing', 'girl', 'capable', 'defending', 'herself.it', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'seeing', 'holocaust', 'film', 'where', 'ordinary', 'german', 'citizens', 'tried', 'help', 'being', 'murdered', 'story', 'believably', 'explained', 'why', 'risked', 'lives.I', 'think', 'film', 'captured', 'well', 'time', 'girl', 'lives', 'becomes', 'young', 'ladies', 'when', 'are', 'competitive', 'feisty', 'tomboys', 'was', 'fun', 'see', 'believable.Cried', 'alot', 'film', 'especially', 'scenes', 'horrific', 'Kristallnacht', 'bombing', 'deaths', 'foster', 'family', 'friends', 'music', 'especially', 'effecting', 'sequences.probably', 'biggest', 'weakness', 'not', 'really', 'showing', 'who', 'girl', ""'m"", 'reminded', 'anne', 'green', 'gables', 'anne', 'was', 'similar', 'age', 'temperament', 'position', 'life', 'heroine', 'anne', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'clearly', 'developed', 'character', 'here', 'part', 'problem', 'think', 'just', 'train', 'not', 'enough', 'information', 'her', 'family', 'life', 'foster', 'parents', 'pleasant', 'character', 'always', 'abit', 'distant', ""'re"", 'not', 'really', 'attached', 'apparently', 'screenwriter', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'he/she', 'needed', 'do', 'when', 'first', 'met', 'death', 'voice', 'not', 'strong', 'attaching', 'feature', 'then', 'screaming', 'discovery', 'little', 'brother', 'death', 'think', 'story', 'needed', 'better', 'different', 'introduction', 'get', 'sense', 'who', 'person.overall', 'okay', 'story', 'best', 'elements', 'are', 'german', 'couple', 'characterizations', 'not', 'really', 'believable', 'Frau', 'would', 'go', 'school', 'inform', 'heroine', 'Max', 'was', 'recovering', 'previous', 'characterization', 'Frau', 'did', ""n't"", 'support', 'effusiveness', 'up', 'point', 'screenwriter', 'needed', 'fix', 'acting', 'Emma', 'Jeffery', 'was', 'great', 'usual']",N/A

My advice is when the time comes, don't panic. It doesn't seem to help.&#8221;  Wisdom according to Death.Film can be many things.  It can document an event, it can imagine a far away world, it can tell a story with an alternate ending, it can be a visual symphony and in the case of &#8220;The Book Thief&#8221; it can be allegorical poetry.  And with a John Williams score it can be sublime allegorical poetry.In every sense of the word Brian Percival directs this production not as a WW2 period piece although the period of Hitler&#8217;s Germany is everywhere.  We are used to such pieces being told from the point of view of victim, heroes, escapees or the Allied liberation.  We are not used to sympathizing with Nazis and here we are forced to.  But we are never often offered the point of view of Death as a character but if Death is a protagonist this is the film he was meant to star in.  Inded, Percival gives us Death as both narrator and subject of this ode to life.Meet Liesl.  Her new adoptive parents Hans and Rosa.  Hans has a musical soul and Rosa is cloaked in thunder.  We meet Rudy and Franz, classmates of Liesl in her new school.  Rudy would have been her prom date in several years but Franz was just a schoolyard bully.  And we meet Ilsa, wife of the Burgermeister and caretaker of her dead son&#8217;s library where books can be conviently stolen by Liesl, our book stealer.  And then there&#8217;s Max.  The sun of a Jew who saved Hans&#8217; life in WW1 by sacrificing his own.  They are hiding Max in their basement.  Max nearly dies but lives and leaves sacrificing his own safety so Liesl and her new family can live.And because every symphonic allegorical poem, even of the sublime type, needs a climax Death does not hold back even as Death nonchalantly describes their last evening together:&#8220;No one intended to destroy a street named after Heaven that evening.  It was a misread on a map.  No sirens that evening.  First were Rudy&#8217;s brothers.  I wrapped their simple dreams.  Then I kissed his mother.  And stole the meanness from Franz Deutcher&#8217;s heart.  Rosa I caught mid snore&#8230;&#8230;and I felt her regrets for not sharing more of her very big heart.  As for Hans his soul was lighter than a child&#8217;s &#8230;..and I heard his final thought&#8230;..Liesl.&#8221;Death continues, &#8220;Rudy-  his soul just rolled into my arms.&#8221;As the rescue effort is underway we learn that Liesl lives and so does Max.  And again Death speaks:  &#8220;Humans.  I see their ugliness and their beauty and I wonder how the same can be both.  All I know is that I&#8217;m haunted by humans.&#8221;This film has entirely satisfying ending and is hauntingly beautiful.",5,We all Die.,1400371200,"05 18, 2014",2014,2849,"['Book', 'Thief', '8220', 'One', 'small', 'fact', 'are', 'going', 'die', 'effort', 'one', 'forever', 'Sorry', 'be', 'such', 'spoiler', 'advice', 'when', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'panic', ""n't"", 'seem', 'help.', '8221', 'Wisdom', 'according', 'Death.Film', 'can', 'be', 'many', 'things', 'can', 'document', 'event', 'can', 'imagine', 'far', 'away', 'world', 'can', 'tell', 'story', 'alternate', 'ending', 'can', 'be', 'visual', 'symphony', 'case', '8220', 'Book', 'Thief', '8221', 'can', 'be', 'allegorical', 'poetry', 'John', 'Williams', 'score', 'can', 'be', 'sublime', 'allegorical', 'poetry.In', 'sense', 'word', 'Brian', 'Percival', 'production', 'not', 'WW2', 'period', 'piece', 'period', 'Hitler', '8217', 's', 'Germany', 'everywhere', 'are', 'used', 'such', 'pieces', 'being', 'told', 'point', 'view', 'victim', 'heroes', 'escapees', 'Allied', 'liberation', 'are', 'not', 'used', 'sympathizing', 'Nazis', 'here', 'are', 'forced', 'are', 'never', 'often', 'offered', 'point', 'view', 'Death', 'character', 'Death', 'protagonist', 'film', 'was', 'meant', 'star', 'Inded', 'Percival', 'Death', 'narrator', 'subject', 'ode', 'life.Meet', 'Liesl', 'new', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'Hans', 'Rosa', 'Hans', 'musical', 'soul', 'Rosa', 'cloaked', 'thunder', 'meet', 'Rudy', 'Franz', 'classmates', 'Liesl', 'new', 'school', 'Rudy', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'prom', 'date', 'several', 'years', 'Franz', 'was', 'just', 'schoolyard', 'bully', 'meet', 'Ilsa', 'wife', 'Burgermeister', 'caretaker', 'dead', 'son', '8217', 'library', 'where', 'books', 'can', 'be', 'conviently', 'stolen', 'Liesl', 'book', 'stealer', 'then', '8217', 'Max', 'sun', 'Jew', 'who', 'saved', 'Hans', '8217', 'life', 'WW1', 'sacrificing', 'own', 'are', 'hiding', 'Max', 'basement', 'Max', 'nearly', 'lives', 'sacrificing', 'own', 'safety', 'so', 'Liesl', 'new', 'family', 'can', 'live.And', 'because', 'symphonic', 'allegorical', 'poem', 'even', 'sublime', 'type', 'climax', 'Death', 'not', 'hold', 'back', 'even', 'Death', 'nonchalantly', 'last', 'evening', 'together', '8220', 'one', 'intended', 'destroy', 'street', 'named', 'Heaven', 'evening', 'was', 'misread', 'map', 'No', 'sirens', 'evening', 'First', 'were', 'Rudy', '8217', 's', 'brothers', 'wrapped', 'simple', 'dreams', 'Then', 'kissed', 'mother', 'stole', 'meanness', 'Franz', 'Deutcher', '8217', 's', 'heart', 'Rosa', 'caught', 'snore', '8230', '8230', 'felt', 'regrets', 'not', 'sharing', 'more', 'very', 'big', 'heart', 'Hans', 'soul', 'was', 'lighter', 'child', '8217', '8230', 'heard', 'final', 'thought', '8230', '..Liesl.', '8221', 'Death', '8220', 'Rudy-', 'soul', 'just', 'rolled', 'arms.', '8221', 'rescue', 'effort', 'underway', 'learn', 'Liesl', 'so', 'Max', 'again', 'Death', 'speaks', '8220', 'Humans', 'see', 'ugliness', 'beauty', 'wonder', 'how', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'know', '8217', 'haunted', 'humans.', '8221', 'film', 'entirely', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful']",N/A

Her brother dies, her mother must put her up for adoption, her foster mother (Watson) is terribly cruel, and her classmates call her ""dummkopf"" because she cannot read. But Liesel's a fighter. With the help of her kindly foster father (Rush), she learns to read. A young neighbor boy (Nico Liersch) admires Liesel's spunk and the two become fast friends. But Liesel's growing love of books and reading puts her at risk in an increasingly authoritative Germany. When her family gives refuge to a Jew, Max (Ben Schnetzer), he encourages Liesel to think about becoming a writer.The events of the war lead to catastrophe but Liesel ultimately finds redemption in her writing.I enjoyed this tear jerker very much. The story and cast are simply superb. The only element of the film I object to is the part of the urbane Grim Reaper narrator who judges souls according to their goodness. But who is good?  God's Word says none are righteous.""There is none righteous, not even one."" Romans 3:10""For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."" Romans 3:23Yes, death and judgement certainly come to us all but God's Word says those who have faith in Jesus Christ will be saved.""For the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."" Romans 6:23""For there is one God and one mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus."" 1 Timothy 2:5""Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved."" Romans 10:13The notion of a mythological grim reaper who collects souls and weighs and judges them according to the good and evil they have done is quite popular but is contrary to New Testament Christianity. Jesus came to save sinners, not the self-righteous (Luke 5:32).

The mother is upset that she only got one child while the father (Rush) falls instantly in love with Liesel. When he finds out she in unable to read he begins to teach her. This simple act of kindness changes the lives of everyone. This is a very hard movie to review. The subject matter is powerful and anything set in Germany during WWII comes with a certain aura itself. This movie however was just so slow moving and at times so boring I found it hard to stay focused on. The innocence of the little girl set against the backdrop of Nazi Germany is a great contrast and a good idea but the execution was lacking. I wasn't expecting an action movie or anything but it was just so slow that I really couldn't get into it. Also this is one of the most depressing things I have ever seen so the fact that it was very slow and depressing makes it hard for me to recommend. Overall, sad and slow.

The Book Thief is one of those movies.  Directed by Brian Percival (Downton Abbey, North & South) from a screenplay by Michael Petroni (The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys) adapted from the novel of the same name by Marcus Zusak, The Book Thief does not lend itself to easy categorization.  On the surface, you'd think from the trailers that it's an Anne Frank sort of film, a young girl's POV about life under the Nazis and about a family hiding a young Jewish man in their house.  But it's more than that, a lot more.You know you're in for something different when the film begins with the narrated line ""Here's a small fact:  you're going to die.""  You know you're in for something really different when you realize that the narrator is Death.  And it is Death who introduces us to Liesel (marvelously played by Sophie N&eacute;lisse) a young German girl riding on a train with her very ill younger brother, being taken to a place she does not know to live with people she's never met.  Her brother does not make it, dying before they reach their destination, resulting in the train stopping for an impromptu burial service. As they are departing the grave, Sophie notices a book that fell out of the makeshift shroud her brother had been buried in and on an impulse she steals it, wanting to have something to remember him by.  Her first stolen book, but as it turns out, far from her last.When Liesel reaches her destination, she is taken to meet the couple who are to become her foster parents, Hans (Geoffrey Rush) and Rosa (Emily Watson) Hubermann. Hans, who makes his living as a house painter and sometime accordionist, is genial and welcoming. Rosa, who takes in laundry for some of the town's more prosperous citizens, is stern and no nonsense. Witnessing Liesel's arrival is a neighbor boy, Rudy Steiner (Nico Liersch) whose curiosity about her quickly evolves into a hopelessly sweet crush, prompting him to ask to walk her to school on her first day. Things however get off to a rocky start when the teacher directs Liesel to write her name on the blackboard and, after awkward hesitation, she can only write a couple of X's, revealing that she can neither read nor write. The other children taunt her, particularly one boy, a bully named Franz (Levin Liam) who follows her into the schoolyard, daring her to read a single word. Liesel finally retaliates by attacking Franz and beating him up in front of the other kids, which earns her definite points in Rudy's estimation.When he hears of the incident, Hans gently sits down with Liesel and informs her that he's not such a good reader himself and suggests that perhaps they can learn to read together, which prompts Liesel to bring out the book she took from her brother's grave, saying this is what she wants to learn to read, and so the book thief learns to read from the first book she stole. To help her, Hans turns the basement into a kind of makeshift schoolroom, painting the letters of the alphabet on various walls and columns and giving Liesel chalk to write each new word she learns under the letter it starts with.The cast are excellent, particularly Sophie N&eacute;lisse (Monsieur Lazhar) as Liesel, a young girl coming of age under circumstances few children should ever have to experience but all too many did.  Veteran actor Geoffrey Rush (The King's Speech, Shakespeare in Love) is perfect as Hans Hubermann, the amiably gentle man who becomes Liesel's adoptive father, as is Emily Watson (Anna Karenina, Angela's Ashes) as Rosa, Hans' brusque, hard-nosed wife who becomes Liesel's adoptive mother and who later surprises Liesel by showing that you truly cannot judge a book by its cover.  Nico Liersch does an excellent job as Rudy, the boy who becomes Liesel's best friend and who has a sweet but seemingly hopeless crush on her, forever begging her for a kiss.  Ben Schnetzer (Happy Town) is quietly effective as Max, the young Jewish man who prompts Liesel's initial forays into story-telling by having her describe to him what goes on in the world outside the Hubermann basement, the world where he does not dare venture. And Roger Allam (V for Vendetta, Inkheart) is outstanding as the unseen but ever felt narrating Death, adding a subtle dimension to events as viewed from his unique perspective.I have not read the book, but from what I gather the film had to reduce the number of characters somewhat in order to give more focus to the main characters in the more limited amount of time available to a film version. But from what other reviewers who have read the book have said, this does not seem to get in the way in their enjoyment of the film.In addition to all of the things that make The Book Thief work is John Williams' sweetly haunting score that enhances the lyrical quality of the film, giving it the feel of almost being a fairy tale in spite of the stressful time and circumstances, which is in a way fitting when you think about the nature of many fairy tales that deal with the darker elements of childhood.  I personally think this score is the best work Williams has done in years and may end up getting a nod at Oscar time.Highly recommended.",5,"A strangely lyrical young girl's coming of age tale, set in

Like peppering the English dialog with German expletives and calling children by abusive names. Like showing a red mailbox when that color would have been a real exception from the universal yellow for mailboxes and postal trucks. You have to suspend disbelief when a ten year old in the German school system is depicted as unable to write her own name. Or showing a book that sinks like a stone in icy water. And the child characters don't grow and mature during the seven years of the film's duration.

1676070,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00G15MDI0,Z Hayes,"[126, 135]","Those who love Markus Zusak's The Book Thief as I do will know that it is an incredibly complex novel - the way the main characters intersect each other's lives and the themes that are developed throughout the novel are deep and layered and would make for a daunting on-screen translation. Yet director Brian Percival manages to make the movie accessible to viewers whilst staying true to the source material. This may not be a blow-by-blow, faithful to each and every word adaptation, but to me at least, it is a true adaptation in portraying the essence of the story. I love the book but I also loved the movie, for similar and different reasons.The story of The Book Thief begins with the narrator, Death (Roger Allam), providing a sort of overview/introduction. Fortunately, the narrator's voice is not dominant throughout the story as it would (to me) have been a rather distracting voice, but the narrator's presence is felt nevertheless. The protagonist in this film is Liesel (Sophie Nelisse in a ground-breaking performance), a young teenager who comes to live with her foster parents, Hans Hubermann (Geoffrey Rush) and his wife, the acid- tongued Rosa (Emily Watson). The setting at the beginning of the story is Germany in 1938 and the story goes on till the end of WW II. Liesel's mother is a Communist and has been packed off somewhere, presumably a camp, for this is after all Nazi Germany.The story focuses on Liesel's relationship with her foster parents, her best friend, Rudy (Nico Liersch), and her life-defining friendship with Max (Ben Schnetzer), the young Jewish man hiding in her parents' basement. At the beginning of the story Liesl is unable to read but this slowly changes as first her foster father Hans and later Max help her see beyond the words to the very notions underlying those words. Soon Liesel is reading voraciously and also developing a keen sense of what it means to live in such troubled times, and who by the end of the story, has come to truly understand the power of words and what defines moral courage.The themes in the book are manifold and I felt these themes were beautifully portrayed in the film. The ideas of friendship, paternal and maternal love, loyalty, and courage, not to mention of course, Death, are credibly-woven together in such a way that these themes flow throughout the film as a whole instead of distinct parts. The cast, especially Nelisse as Liesel, delivers a finely-nuanced performance, every emotion captured by those beautiful, wide, expressive eyes, and Rush as her foster father Hans portrays the very symbol of paternal love and moral courage (especially in the scene where he stands up to a Gestapo officer in defense of a friend).The film is rated PG-13, but I watched this with my husband and 9-year-old (who has read The Diary of Anne Frank and is somewhat familiar with the history of the Holocaust), and she was absolutely captivated by this film. There are no scenes of extreme or prolonged violence - some scenes of kids fighting, Nazis dragging people off, Nazis burning books, children chanting pro-Nazi slogans (which is disturbing to me but of course given the context of the film, it cannot be helped), Nazis and collaborators destroying Jewish property during Kristallnacht, but nothing like the scenes one sees in movies like Schindler's List. It made for an interesting family discussion after we finished viewing it.The film's ultimate message is positive and there are certainly many interesting issues that come up for discussion - moral courage being one that I felt was significant. Do we stand by and watch atrocities and injustice perpetrated without voicing against it, and if we do, are we prepared for the repercussions? These and more are satisfactorily addressed in this film, and I count this as one of the more memorable films of 2013.",5,"""I am haunted by humans""",1385596800,"11 28, 2013",2013,3844,"['who', 'love', 'Markus', 'Zusak', 'Book', 'Thief', 'do', 'will', 'know', 'incredibly', 'complex', 'novel', 'way', 'main', 'characters', 'intersect', 'other', 'lives', 'themes', 'are', 'developed', 'novel', 'are', 'deep', 'layered', 'would', 'make', 'daunting', 'on-screen', 'translation', 'director', 'Brian', 'Percival', 'make', 'movie', 'accessible', 'viewers', 'whilst', 'staying', 'true', 'source', 'material', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'blow-by-blow', 'faithful', 'word', 'adaptation', 'least', 'true', 'adaptation', 'portraying', 'essence', 'story', 'love', 'book', 'also', 'loved', 'movie', 'similar', 'different', 'reasons.The', 'story', 'Book', 'Thief', 'narrator', 'Death', 'Roger', 'Allam', 'providing', 'sort', 'overview/introduction', 'Fortunately', 'narrator', 'voice', 'not', 'dominant', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'rather', 'distracting', 'voice', 'narrator', 'presence', 'felt', 'nevertheless', 'protagonist', 'film', 'Liesel', 'Sophie', 'Nelisse', 'ground-breaking', 'performance', 'young', 'teenager', 'who', 'live', 'foster', 'parents', 'Hans', 'Hubermann', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'wife', 'acid-', 'tongued', 'Rosa', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'setting', 'beginning', 'story', 'Germany', '1938', 'story', 'end', 'WW', 'II', 'Liesel', 'mother', 'Communist', 'been', 'packed', 'off', 'somewhere', 'presumably', 'camp', 'Nazi', 'Germany.The', 'story', 'Liesel', 'relationship', 'foster', 'parents', 'best', 'friend', 'Rudy', 'Nico', 'Liersch', 'life-defining', 'friendship', 'Max', 'Ben', 'Schnetzer', 'young', 'Jewish', 'man', 'hiding', 'parents', 'basement', 'beginning', 'story', 'Liesl', 'unable', 'read', 'slowly', 'first', 'foster', 'father', 'Hans', 'later', 'Max', 'help', 'see', 'words', 'very', 'notions', 'underlying', 'words', 'Soon', 'Liesel', 'reading', 'voraciously', 'also', 'developing', 'keen', 'sense', 'what', 'live', 'such', 'troubled', 'times', 'who', 'end', 'story', 'come', 'truly', 'understand', 'power', 'words', 'what', 'moral', 'courage.The', 'themes', 'book', 'are', 'manifold', 'felt', 'themes', 'were', 'beautifully', 'portrayed', 'film', 'ideas', 'friendship', 'paternal', 'maternal', 'love', 'loyalty', 'courage', 'not', 'mention', 'course', 'Death', 'are', 'credibly-woven', 'together', 'such', 'way', 'themes', 'flow', 'film', 'whole', 'instead', 'distinct', 'parts', 'cast', 'especially', 'Nelisse', 'Liesel', 'finely-nuanced', 'performance', 'emotion', 'captured', 'beautiful', 'wide', 'expressive', 'eyes', 'Rush', 'foster', 'father', 'Hans', 'very', 'symbol', 'paternal', 'love', 'moral', 'courage', 'especially', 'scene', 'where', 'up', 'Gestapo', 'officer', 'defense', 'friend', '.The', 'film', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'watched', 'husband', '9-year-old', 'who', 'read', 'Diary', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'somewhat', 'familiar', 'history', 'Holocaust', 'was', 'absolutely', 'captivated', 'film', 'are', 'scenes', 'extreme', 'prolonged', 'violence', 'scenes', 'kids', 'fighting', 'Nazis', 'dragging', 'people', 'Nazis', 'burning', 'books', 'children', 'chanting', 'pro-Nazi', 'slogans', 'disturbing', 'course', 'given', 'context', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'helped', 'Nazis', 'collaborators', 'destroying', 'Jewish', 'property', 'Kristallnacht', 'nothing', 'scenes', 'one', 'sees', 'movies', 'Schindler', 'List', 'made', 'interesting', 'family', 'discussion', 'finished', 'viewing', 'it.The', 'film', 'ultimate', 'message', 'positive', 'are', 'certainly', 'many', 'interesting', 'issues', 'come', 'up', 'discussion', 'moral', 'courage', 'being', 'one', 'felt', 'was', 'significant', 'Do', 'stand', 'watch', 'atrocities', 'injustice', 'perpetrated', 'voicing', 'do', 'are', 'prepared', 'repercussions', 'more', 'are', 'satisfactorily', 'addressed', 'film', 'count', 'one', 'more', 'memorable', 'films', '2013']",N/A
