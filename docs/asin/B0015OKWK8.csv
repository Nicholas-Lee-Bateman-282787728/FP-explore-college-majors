I think I would've REALLY liked it if they didn't stick with the ending that they did.We have Tara whose mother just ups and goes away leaving her with her Uncle James.  James, while a ""good"" guy, can't seem to get his act together and ends up getting fired from his job.  James is then deemed unfit to care for Tara and she ends up in an orphange.  After staying there for a time, James takes her out for her birthday and he never returns her.  They end up taking a road trip to the farm where James and Tara's mother grew up, only to find his father to be a ruthless... well, whatever explative you want to use here.This is where I became somewhat removed from the movie.  There is a scene where the father (played by Dennis Hopper) starts physically beating on Tara after having beat James for a bit.  James, finally standing up to his dad and standing up for himself, takes a shovel to his father, thus rescuing Tara.  I have no problem with James' decision to hit his father to prevent harm from coming to Tara, but what he did next is where I start to disconnect with the movie.I think I would've enjoyed the movie much more if the ending had dealt with the complex emotions and decisions Tara would've been faced with of having to return to the mother who abandonded her versus wanting to stay with James who took care of her, and loved her, in a way her mother never did.Yet another good movie spoiled by unnecessary violence and the consequences of said violence.",3,3.5 stars - unnecessary ending (spoiler),1229644800,"12 19, 2008",2008,1492,"['like', 'movie', 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'REALLY', 'liked', 'did', ""n't"", 'stick', 'ending', 'did.We', 'have', 'Tara', 'mother', 'just', 'ups', 'away', 'leaving', 'Uncle', 'James', 'James', 'good', 'guy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'act', 'together', 'up', 'getting', 'fired', 'job', 'James', 'then', 'deemed', 'unfit', 'care', 'Tara', 'up', 'orphange', 'staying', 'there', 'time', 'James', 'out', 'birthday', 'never', 'end', 'up', 'taking', 'road', 'trip', 'farm', 'where', 'James', 'Tara', 'mother', 'grew', 'up', 'only', 'find', 'father', 'be', 'ruthless', 'well', 'explative', 'want', 'use', 'here.This', 'where', 'became', 'somewhat', 'removed', 'movie', 'scene', 'where', 'father', 'played', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'physically', 'beating', 'Tara', 'having', 'beat', 'James', 'bit', 'James', 'finally', 'standing', 'up', 'dad', 'standing', 'up', 'shovel', 'father', 'thus', 'rescuing', 'Tara', 'have', 'problem', 'James', 'decision', 'hit', 'father', 'prevent', 'harm', 'coming', 'Tara', 'what', 'did', 'next', 'where', 'start', 'disconnect', 'movie.I', 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'ending', 'had', 'dealt', 'complex', 'emotions', 'decisions', 'Tara', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'faced', 'having', 'return', 'mother', 'who', 'abandonded', 'versus', 'wanting', 'stay', 'James', 'who', 'took', 'care', 'her', 'loved', 'way', 'mother', 'never', 'good', 'movie', 'spoiled', 'unnecessary', 'violence', 'consequences', 'said', 'violence']",Sleepwalking

1150056,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0015OKWK8,Grady Harp,"[14, 17]","New director William Maher and writer Zac Stanford previously worked together in THE CHUMSCRUBBER and the similarity of vision is apparent in SLEEPWALKING: both films deal with the empty shells of hollow people aimlessly seeking connection in a world that has become foreign territory. It is a dark, cold, brooding film that somehow manages to maintain our attention with the hope that the gloomy tunnel though which the characters are passing will have a semblance of light at the end.Joleen (Charlize Theron) is the inadequate, loving-but-inconstant mother of twelve-year-old Tara (AnnaSophia Robb) whose reckless an aimless life leads to constant moving and lack of roots.  Evicted form her latest residence Joleen and Tara move in with Joleen's younger brother  James (Nick Stahl) whose similarly aimless life is defined by a trashy apartment and a mindless construction work job. Tara is sullen, disappointed in her mother's erratic, irresponsible behavior, and when Joleen once again takes off 'on a new idea', Tara is left with James - trying to figure out an existence for survival.  James loses his job due to absenteeism, takes up residence in the filthy basement of his nerdy co-worker Randall (Woody Harelson), while the town cop (Mathew St. Patrick) reluctantly places Tara in a foster home to await the return of Joleen. Tara prefers life with James to her 'imprisonment' and the two take off on a road trip, seeking some degree of happiness and love in a world gone berserk. When James runs out of money, he heads to his old home farm for refuge, an unlikely endpoint as his and Joleen's  childhood was warped by their abusive farmer father (Dennis Hopper).  The return to the farm, James hopes, will provide connection to Tara's past, but instead it results in a tragedy that ultimately moves Tara back to her 'home' and to Joleen, while James drives off into the unknown future, finally awakened from his sleepwalking through life.The film is as bleak as the flat and snowy countryside (the film was shot in Canada's winter) and that countryside reflects the desperate loneliness of the characters.  The small cast offers solid portrayals with the work of Nick Stahl being the standout performance.  Theron, Robb, Harelson, Hopper, and Deborra-Lee Furness (in a small but poignant role) make the best of a shaky script.  This is a mood piece and can become depressing if the viewer expects resolution of the sad and empty lives the characters lead. But there is a haunting quality to the look of the film that stays with the viewer, especially in the mystery in the eyes of the character James as he drives into an unknown but awakened future.

She seemingly loves her daughter Tara (AnnaSophia Robb), but lacks the capacity to care for her appropriately.  Instead, she's more concerned with dressing up, going out whoring, and finding the next one-night stand.  Essentially, she's an unfinanced prostitute.  When she runs on hard times, she turns to her kind-hearted brother James (Nick Stahl).  Despite his meager living conditions, he has a good heart and takes his relatives in as guests.Unexpectedly, Jolene cowardly and irresponsibly abandons her daughter and brother with a letter and a few dollars.  The letter states that she'll soon be back, but neither her brother nor her daughter have much faith.  When they both shirk their responsibilities - Nick misses work and Tara misses school - to search for Jolene, their lack of luck leads to a change in life.James loses his job due to his constant tardiness, and the already difficult situation with his niece becomes even more unsteady.  Soon thereafter, Tara is taken to social services, James sells all his possessions and gets evicted from his apartment, and both feel that their lives are spiraling out of control.  Luckily for James, he has a loser friend Randall (Woody Harrelson) with a basement and an air mattress.  With a shared desire to find something better, James leaves the dark basement and gets Tara - freshly rescued from social services.  At first the trip is a mystery to Tara, but she soom learns that the two are venturing towards refuge with the abusive, estranged father (Dennis Hopper) James and Jolene left behind.  Things haven't changed on their childhood farm, and the abuse continues anew.  Quite often an abused child returns with not only issues, but also a score to settle.  The drama, battle of wills, and tension boils over, as a potentially explosive relatioship comes to fruition.In the end a strong cast is somewhat ruined by a slow pace and weak performances and a lack of resolution.

1150064,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B0015OKWK8,Only-A-Child,"[0, 1]","You hate to take shots at a film like ""Sleepwalking"", which was obviously a labor of love for producer Charlize Theron, who called in a lot of favors and assembled a first-rate cast and crew to make this film.  But as Yogi Berra once said: ""If you don't know where you are going, you'll probably end up someplace else"".  Apparently there was so much self-delusion going into the project that no one grasped the slow motion train wreck that this film would become after a very promising first 30 minutes.If nothing else ""Sleepwalking"" illustrates that the constraining factor limiting the supply of ""good"" films is in the pre-production area, where producers must grasp at straws in a field of totally lame scripts in the hope that a lot of hard work in the production and post-production phases can make something out of nothing.""Sleepwalking"" could be described as a sanitized version of Terry Gilliam's ""Tideland"" (2005).  Both films are about a young person dealing with an especially traumatic childhood environment and there are a lot of production design similarities.  But ""Sleepwalking"" trades ""Tideland's"" American Gothic ""Alice in Wonderland"" quality for a somewhat muddled but very sincere and gritty redemption theme.This effectively eliminates ""Tideland's"" off-kilter fans as likely viewers and leaves one wondering who might find the last hour of the film worthwhile viewing.  Maybe longtime fans of Joni Mtichell's ""Blue"" album could tap into it during periods of sedation. Mitchell's comments about her album fit quite nicely into a discussion of  ""Sleepwalking"":  ""The Blue album, there's hardly a dishonest note in the vocals. At that period of my life, I had no personal defenses. I felt like a cellophane wrapper on a pack of cigarettes. I felt like I had absolutely no secrets from the world and I couldn't pretend in my life to be strong. Or to be happy. But the advantage of it in the music was that there were no defenses there either.""Then again, what do I know?

1150067,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0015OKWK8,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 1]","""Sleepwalking"" starts off a bit like ""Frozen River,"" focused on a single mother struggling to make ends meet in rural America (though it was actually filmed in Saskatchewan).  But the movie quickly veers off in another direction, shifting that focus onto her 13-year-old daughter, Tara, and her younger brother, James (the girl's uncle), who are suddenly forced  to rely on one another for comfort and support when Joleen temporarily bows out of the picture.When her boyfriend is arrested for growing marijuana, Jolene (Carlize Theron) and Tara (AnnaSophia Robb) are forced to move in with James (Nick Stahl), a soft-spoken, good-hearted fellow in his 20s who is two months behind in his rent and who barely scrapes by on what he makes at his low-paying construction job.  Soon, Joleen has split the scene, James has lost his job, and social services has taken Tara to live in a foster-care facility.  So James and Tara decide to head out onto the open highway, stopping off at roadside diners and motels, and staying one step ahead of the authorities who are in pursuit of them.""Sleepwalking"" is one of those gritty, slice-of-life dramas that sympathetically and accurately depicts what life is like for the working poor.  It is rife with authentic details and rich in small town atmosphere.  Director William Mahr and cinematographer Juan Ruiz Anchia really know how to extract the essence of a locale for mood and effect, making the bleak landscape and stark setting integral elements in the drama - an effect greatly enhanced by Christopher Young`s rich and evocative acoustic-flavored score.  Superb, naturalistic performances by the three lead actors make us truly care about the people they are portraying and the things that are happening to them.""Sleepwalking"" is not without its flaws, however.  For one thing, the movie undercuts some of its carefully crafted verisimilitude with its casting of ""name"" actors in a few of the key secondary roles - primarily, Woody Harrelson as James' friend and work buddy, and an over-reaching Dennis Hopper as Joleen and James' abusive dad.  These parts would have been more effective had they been played by less-familiar actors (though I do realize that, without such star power attached to the project, a movie like ""Sleepwalking"" might never have gotten made in the first place).  More seriously, the otherwise excellent screenplay by Zac Stanford falls apart a bit in the final third, resorting to stereotyping and hokey melodrama when it most needs to stay true to its characters and their situations.Still, despite the patness, ""Sleepwalking"" is a quietly powerful, richly atmospheric tale of a group of troubled but essentially decent people struggling, despite their all-too-human weaknesses, to make their way in the world.",4,moving and atmospheric indie drama,1250985600,"08 23, 2009",2009,2779,"['Sleepwalking', 'bit', 'Frozen', 'River', 'focused', 'single', 'mother', 'struggling', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'rural', 'America', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed', 'Saskatchewan', 'movie', 'quickly', 'veers', 'off', 'direction', 'shifting', 'focus', '13-year-old', 'daughter', 'Tara', 'younger', 'brother', 'James', 'girl', 'uncle', 'who', 'are', 'suddenly', 'forced', 'rely', 'one', 'comfort', 'support', 'when', 'Joleen', 'temporarily', 'picture.When', 'boyfriend', 'arrested', 'growing', 'marijuana', 'Jolene', 'Carlize', 'Theron', 'Tara', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'are', 'forced', 'move', 'James', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'soft-spoken', 'good-hearted', 'fellow', '20s', 'who', 'two', 'months', 'rent', 'who', 'barely', 'scrapes', 'what', 'low-paying', 'construction', 'job', 'Soon', 'Joleen', 'split', 'scene', 'James', 'lost', 'job', 'social', 'services', 'taken', 'Tara', 'live', 'foster-care', 'facility', 'So', 'James', 'Tara', 'decide', 'head', 'out', 'open', 'highway', 'stopping', 'off', 'roadside', 'diners', 'motels', 'staying', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'authorities', 'who', 'are', 'pursuit', 'Sleepwalking', 'one', 'gritty', 'slice-of-life', 'dramas', 'sympathetically', 'accurately', 'what', 'life', 'working', 'poor', 'rife', 'authentic', 'details', 'rich', 'small', 'town', 'atmosphere', 'Director', 'William', 'Mahr', 'cinematographer', 'Juan', 'Ruiz', 'Anchia', 'really', 'know', 'how', 'extract', 'essence', 'locale', 'mood', 'effect', 'making', 'bleak', 'landscape', 'stark', 'setting', 'integral', 'elements', 'drama', 'effect', 'greatly', 'enhanced', 'Christopher', 'Young', 's', 'rich', 'evocative', 'acoustic-flavored', 'score', 'Superb', 'naturalistic', 'performances', 'three', 'lead', 'actors', 'make', 'truly', 'care', 'people', 'are', 'portraying', 'things', 'are', 'happening', 'Sleepwalking', 'not', 'flaws', 'however', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'verisimilitude', 'casting', 'name', 'actors', 'few', 'key', 'secondary', 'roles', 'primarily', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'James', 'friend', 'work', 'buddy', 'over-reaching', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'Joleen', 'James', 'abusive', 'dad', 'parts', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'effective', 'had', 'been', 'played', 'less-familiar', 'actors', 'do', 'realize', 'such', 'star', 'power', 'attached', 'project', 'movie', 'Sleepwalking', 'might', 'never', 'have', 'gotten', 'made', 'first', 'place', 'More', 'seriously', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'screenplay', 'Zac', 'Stanford', 'apart', 'bit', 'final', 'third', 'resorting', 'stereotyping', 'hokey', 'melodrama', 'when', 'most', 'stay', 'true', 'characters', 'situations.Still', 'patness', 'Sleepwalking', 'quietly', 'powerful', 'richly', 'atmospheric', 'tale', 'group', 'troubled', 'essentially', 'decent', 'people', 'struggling', 'all-too-human', 'weaknesses', 'make', 'way', 'world']",Sleepwalking

But we also have a script and overall disgust of mutual gratification (the DVD docu is filled with so many accolades about how ""everyone is God"" complex it was sickening) that no one felt they had to act.The story revolves around a mother who abandons her child onto her brother - who in turn decide to visit the ignored patriarch of their family. In this process we see a blend of horrible filming (the continuous pan wide to close shots made it feel like a Lifetime movie), and a script that got so irritating that you felt uncomfortable watching. At 34:20 into the film the characters had become so drab that Woody's entrance as his Kingpin character felt like a breath of relief. Once Dennis Hopper was introduced - their was another feeling of hope - but that was killed immediately by the need to make him unlikeable and unbelievable. Emotional impact moments felt contrived, and when the music started feeling like a Disney channel special, I was frustrated beyond belief.Matthew St Patrick from Six Feet Under (who was excellent in that HBO series) gave the only believable performance in this film and he is not even credited. One artistic bonus I will give this film is the scene with Anna wearing roller skates, a pink fur coat, and Paris Hilton sunglasses  dancing in swimming pool...sounds confusing but I think that is where the filmmakers were. This story was supposed to be in California - but it was snowing in Canada while they were filming so they incorporated that, which was even more confusing.It will be a film forgotten in short order - and I hold nothing against Charlize as she is incredible.
