Lets start from producers--they clearly have no clue what they doing as nobody teach them. Acting--not connected to anything in particular specifically this flick. Connection to reality--zero-I guess nobody from crew ever visited jail or took time to ask how jail operates. Chicks looks pretty but never show any goodies.And in general movie perfectly reflect US as a country and how we rapidly descend into unknown wasteland.

While Alice in Wasteland is not as good as PTU, I really admired how pretty the two lead actresses (Roxanne Sondrup and Michelle Beisner) were.  They'd make nice wives for ANY man.  I'd have a lot trouble trying to pick one of the two.  Michelle is listed as 5'9"" in the movie.  So, in the pair of high heels that she is wearing, she's about 6' tall.
