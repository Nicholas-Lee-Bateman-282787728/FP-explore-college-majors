The cast is the same but Anna Chlumsky is all grown-up and looking like a beautiful young woman, she wants to learn more about her deceased mother so she heads to California to dig up information about her talented mom. While she is in California, she falls for her uncle's girlfriend's son, Nick. The two embark to find who exactly was Vada's mom, was she loving? flighty? did she want to have a family? all these questions are answered and we learn a wonderful fact about her mother. Sequels can be very disappointing most of the time but My Girl 2 is a sweet and charming film about self-discovery.

359897,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6303148255,Byron Kolln,"[0, 0]","Picking up the story several years after the events of the first ""My Girl"" (a surprise worldwide sleeper hit in 1991), 1994's MY GIRL 2 reunites us once again with the irrepressible Vada Sultenfuss and her wacky family.With new stepmother Shelley (Jamie Lee Curtis) heavily pregnant and the entire Sultenfuss household overtaken with baby plans, a pensive Vada (Anna Chlumsky) decides to investigate her own mother, who died during childbirth.  Shelley arranges for Vada to spend a vacation in Los Angeles with Uncle Phil (Richard Masur) and his new ""family"": Rose (Christine Ebersole) and her adolescent son Nick (Austin O'Brien).  It's a summer of discovery, soul-searching and heartache, as Vada uncovers her mother's past and the events which led to her own birth...Anna Chlumsky again delivers a solid turn as Vada, settling the character nicely into the awkward teen years with great skill.  Jamie Lee Curtis and Dan Aykroyd (as Vada's parents) don't really figure into the plot this time but it's nice having them ""around"" anyway.  Austin O'Brien provides strong support as Vada's verbal sparring partner (much the same as Macaulay Culkin's Thomas J. from the first film); Masur and Ebersole undercut the possible sentimentality, always a problem in this sort of story.Providing a fitting finale for Vada and the events of the first movie, MY GIRL 2 is that rare sequel which can stand proud against it's predecessor.TECHNICAL DETAILS:Widescreen 1:85 (16.9 enhanced)soundtracks: English, French, German, Italian, Spanishsubtitles: English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutchclosed-captionedextra features: trailerDisc format: DVD-5 (single-sided, single-layer)",4,"""Why is it boys talk so much, when they have nothing to say?

The plot is also intriguing and original.  I thought it was fascinating how we  get a better look at Vada's mother's life, especially around the time when  she gives birth to her child.  While I have a feeling that Vada is going a  little too overboard on just a school project by flying to the other side  of the country to research (I hate research, the most I'll ever do is look  up a couple sites on the 'net!  Travel to another part of the world?  BLECH!) for her assignment, but it all turns out well and those just happen  to be 'very, very, special circumstances.'

359901,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,6303148255,General Breadbasket,"[0, 0]","""My Girl 2"" continues the story of Vada Sultenfuss and her family, set two or so years on from the original. It's a pretty good sequel, I thought.Vada (Anna Chlumsky) is a little older and a little more sophisticated these days, it seems. She's not just writing poetry, she's reading it, her favorite poet being a certain Alfred Biedermeier. Her father's (Dan Aykroyd's) new wife (Jamie Lee Curtis) is due to have a baby, and soon Vada will be a big sister. In between school and home, she's trying to figure out boys, but hasn't quite got there yet.At school, Vada is given an assignment. She has to write an essay on someone who she admires and has never met. She decides to write it on her mother, who died while Vada was still a baby. Vada knows virtually nothing about her mother, and decides to travel to California, where her mother went to school. She stays with her uncle, and with the help of a certain young man (Austin O' Brian) tracks down her mother's old friends. What Vada discovers shocks her, some of it disgusts and confuses her. Still, there are other discoveries that fill her with pride.""My Girl 2"" is a little different to the first. In terms of the style of the film, it looks a little fresher, a little less dusty. Perhaps it's the California scenery, I don't know. It still has that retro feel, which is good (the film is set in the 1970s). Also, it feels a little more subdued. Vada/Anna isn't quite as hyper as she was in the first film, if that makes sense. She's still a great actress, and a shame she hasn't really been in anything lately.Rather than being in a set few places, like the first film was, ""My Girl 2"" goes from one place to another, which kind of alters the way the film flows. I wouldn't say there is a lot of chemistry between Anna Chlumsky's ""love interest"" Austin O'Brien, but considering they're almost cousins-in-law that's probably not such a bad thing.If you enjoyed the first film, ""My Girl 2"" is definitely worth picking up. A nice continuation of the story.

With rumours of a My Girl 3, to possibly bring Anna Chlumsky back into showbusiness, it's always best to review these movies the way they were meant to be: good!The thing that really gets me about this movie is Austin O'Brien. He's just not the kinda guy that I would be swooning over. Earrings are a barbaric custom?! Excuse me?! Why on earth did they include THAT line. The guy needed a serious hair cut before any sort of swooning should be done. I definitely reckon they should have brought back Thomas J (Macaulay Culkin). I don't care if he died in the first movie, movies do anything these days.To me, the first one was always the best, although the second one has a lot more depth to it. Vada's first love will probably always be Thomas J, and lets face it, no one forgets their first love.This sequel can stand well on its own, without the need of having to have seen the first to understand. Sure, there are some references to Thomas J. It's still as sad as the first one, with Vada 'seeing' her mother, and you feel like crying at that point. Feel like being the appropriate words - I cry at the first one every time I watch it, and get teary at the second.If you're wondering about the song that Vada's mother sings, it's called ""Smile (Though Your Heart Is Breaking)"", and there are a few versions out there by Lyle Lovett & Natalie Cole. The full lyrics go like this:Smile, though your heart is breakingSmile, even though it's achingWhen there are clouds in the sky you'll get byIf you smile through your pain and sorrowSmile, and maybe tomorrowYou'll find the sun come shining through for youLight up your face with gladnessHIde every trace of sadnessAlthough a tear maybe ever so nearThat's the time you must keep on tryingSmile, what's the use in cryingYou'll find that life is still worthwhileIf you'll just smileThat's the time you must keep on tryingSmile, what's the use in cryingYou'll find that life is still worthwhileIf you'll just smileLovely song and a lovely film.

359905,A1P4RH7KMJ1SV2,6303148255,Molly P.,"[7, 7]","Pixie-ish spitfire Vada Sultenfuss has grown up quite a bit since the first film.  She's now thirteen years old, is no longer obsessed with death, and seems to have fully come to terms with the deaths of her mother  and best friend.  In the last film, Vada's father, Harry, got engaged to  Shelly.  In this one, they're married and Shelly is about eight months  pregnant with Harry Jr., and Vada seems okay with it.  Vada's a little  miffed that her father still doesn't seem to understand her passion for  writing, and she's worried that Shelly might die in childbirth like her own  mother did.  She also wants to know more about her mother.  &quot;I wish I  could see her just once, even if it were only in a dream,&quot; says Vada.  A school assignment to write about a person who's achieved something great,  who she's never met, prompts Vada to research her mother.  Her father,  unfortunately, had such a &quot;whirlwind courtship&quot; with the late  Maggie Muldovan-Sultenfuss that he can't tell Vada very much about her  mother.  &quot;Everything I know about her fits into one little box,&quot;  Vada sadly tells Shelly, showing her stepmother a blank passport, some play  programs, and Vada's almost-empty baby book.  Shelly eagerly suggests that  Vada go to California to find out more about her mom--after all, that's  where Maggie grew up, and Vada's Uncle Phil lives there now.  Harry, after  a lot of arm-twisting, allows Vada to go, and she sets off on what becomes  a crazy one-week adventure.  Her uncle has a live-in relationship with his  boss, Rose, who has a son just Vada's age, Nick.  Nick is forced (bribed)  into being Vada's tour guide during her stay.  Together, they locate some  of Maggie's old classmates and teachers, many of whom remember Maggie  fondly and tell Vada she looks just like her mother did.  However, one of  the classmates reveals some disturbing information about Maggie's past,  which eventually leads Vada to someone who can actually show Vada her  mother--in the form of old films.  Vada is mesmerized by these films, and  she realizes that her mother's greatest achievment . . . was Vada.  This is  a sweet, bright, funny, and romantic film.  It's not as sad as the first  film, but it doesn't lack in the emotional department.  Anna Chlumsky  (Vada) delivers quite a different performance than she did in the first  one, and Austin O'Brien (Nick) is a fine Macaulay Culkin replacement.  (Culkin's character, Thomas J., is remembered in this film briefly, proving  that he is still a part of Vada's memory, but that she's moved on.)  Vada,  like in the first film, learns a lot about herself, and the ending leaves  the viewer with a sense that Vada's future looks bright.  Quite a change  from the Vada at the beginning of the first film, who was convinced she had  a chicken bone stuck in her throat. :)",5,"Put on your mood rings, this film's groovy",958694400,"05 19, 2000",2000,2858,"['Pixie-ish', 'spitfire', 'Vada', 'Sultenfuss', 'grown', 'up', 'quite', 'bit', 'first', 'film', 'now', 'thirteen', 'years', 'old', 'no', 'longer', 'obsessed', 'death', 'have', 'fully', 'come', 'terms', 'deaths', 'mother', 'best', 'friend', 'last', 'film', 'Vada', 'father', 'Harry', 'got', 'engaged', 'Shelly', 'one', ""'re"", 'married', 'Shelly', 'eight', 'months', 'pregnant', 'Harry', 'Jr.', 'Vada', 'okay', 'Vada', 'little', 'miffed', 'father', 'still', ""n't"", 'seem', 'understand', 'passion', 'writing', 'worried', 'Shelly', 'might', 'die', 'childbirth', 'own', 'mother', 'did', 'also', 'know', 'more', 'mother', 'quot', 'wish', 'could', 'see', 'just', 'once', 'even', 'were', 'only', 'dream', 'quot', 'Vada', 'A', 'school', 'assignment', 'write', 'person', 'who', 'achieved', 'something', 'great', 'who', 'never', 'met', 'Vada', 'research', 'mother', 'father', 'unfortunately', 'had', 'quot', 'courtship', 'quot', 'late', 'Maggie', 'Muldovan-Sultenfuss', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Vada', 'very', 'much', 'mother', 'quot', 'Everything', 'know', 'fits', 'one', 'little', 'box', 'quot', 'Vada', 'sadly', 'Shelly', 'showing', 'stepmother', 'blank', 'passport', 'play', 'programs', 'Vada', 'almost-empty', 'baby', 'book', 'Shelly', 'eagerly', 'suggests', 'Vada', 'go', 'California', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'mom', 'where', 'Maggie', 'grew', 'up', 'Vada', 'Uncle', 'Phil', 'there', 'now', 'Harry', 'lot', 'arm-twisting', 'Vada', 'go', 'off', 'what', 'crazy', 'one-week', 'adventure', 'uncle', 'live-in', 'relationship', 'boss', 'Rose', 'who', 'son', 'just', 'Vada', 'age', 'Nick', 'Nick', 'forced', 'bribed', 'being', 'Vada', 'tour', 'guide', 'stay', 'Together', 'locate', 'Maggie', 'old', 'classmates', 'teachers', 'many', 'whom', 'remember', 'Maggie', 'fondly', 'tell', 'Vada', 'just', 'mother', 'did', 'However', 'one', 'classmates', 'reveals', 'disturbing', 'information', 'Maggie', 'past', 'eventually', 'Vada', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'actually', 'show', 'Vada', 'mother', 'form', 'old', 'films', 'Vada', 'mesmerized', 'films', 'mother', 'greatest', 'achievment', 'was', 'Vada', 'sweet', 'bright', 'funny', 'romantic', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'sad', 'first', 'film', ""n't"", 'lack', 'emotional', 'department', 'Anna', 'Chlumsky', 'Vada', 'quite', 'different', 'performance', 'did', 'first', 'one', 'Austin', ""O'Brien"", 'Nick', 'fine', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'replacement', 'Culkin', 'character', 'Thomas', 'J.', 'remembered', 'film', 'briefly', 'proving', 'still', 'part', 'Vada', 'memory', 'moved', 'Vada', 'first', 'film', 'lot', 'herself', 'ending', 'viewer', 'sense', 'Vada', 'future', 'bright', 'change', 'Vada', 'beginning', 'first', 'film', 'who', 'was', 'convinced', 'had', 'chicken', 'bone', 'stuck', 'throat']",My Girl 2 VHS

Vada is now 13, tackling a school assignment in which she decides to write about her mother's life. A trip to California to visit her uncle aids in her quest to track down her mother's high school classmates and friends. With each person she interviews, Vada makes some unexpected discoveries about her mother. Her search culminates in a touching, sadly sweet moment when she is able to &quot;meet&quot; her mother. Along the way, Vada finds love from Nick, (played by Austin O'Brien), her somewhat reluctant escort who was paid by Vada's uncle to accompany her around town. I love the fact that all of the primary actors were retained for the sequel (except for Macauley Culkin, whose character died in the first film). Jamie Lee Curtis and Dan Akroyd give fine performances as the happily married Mr. &amp; Mrs. Sultenfuss expecting their first child. While &quot;My Girl&quot; was sad and depressing, &quot;My Girl 2&quot; is positive, upbeat, and great fun. Don't let that surly old curmudgeon, Leonard Maltin, influence you with his review.

In MY GIRL 2, Vada (Anna Chlumsky) is now 13 years old. Her father Harry (Dan Aykroyd) married Shelly (Jamie Lee Curtis), and Shelly is preganent with their first child together. Vada is trying to get through with the problems and confusions of being older, and soon be an older sister. She is also starting to learn about the relationships guys and girls have when they get older. She thinks a boy at her school likes her, but then it turns out he actually likes her friend, Judy. When Vada's English class gets an assignment to write a paper on somebody they admire - and it has to be somebody they never met - Vada decides to write about her mother, since she never knew her. Then Shelly gets the idea of having Vada fly off to Los Angeles, California to visit her Uncle Phil because her mother grew up in LA and Shelly thought she could learn more about her mother if she went down to LA. When Harry reclently lets her go on the trip, Vada meets Rose, Uncle Phil's girlfriend, and Rose's 13-year-old son, Nick (cutie, Austin O'Brien). Nick accompanies Vada on her search to find friends of her mother and other clues who could help her find out more about her mother, because Uncle Phil had paid Nick to help Vada out. But as their adventure goes on, Nick and Vada find a sweet romance where they never expected it in the least. Heartwarming, moving, and very excellent. I really do think this was better than MY GIRL because MY GIRL 2 was more fast-paste and much more energetic.
