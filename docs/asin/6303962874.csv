392996,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,6303962874,Craig Connell,"[0, 1]","""Kill The Umpire"" is a really a funny movie, something Director Lloyd Bacon produced by the carload back in ""the classic era."" Bacon's movies were fast-moving and entertaining, and this was no exception. If you liked William Bendix in his mid-1950s TV show, ""Life Of Riley,"" you'll like this film. He plays the same type of guy.Whether you enjoy baseball or, you'll get a lot of laughs out of it, too. It's just simply a goofy and likable comedy, filled with the kind of characters you'd see in a late '40s/early '50s comedy. What's nice about the older films, too, is that you actually see whole families: dad, mom and a couple of kids.Actually, you more you know about baseball, the more you'll just shake your in disbelief at some of the things you'll see in this story because they could never happen today, or even back in 1950. (i.e. a fan coming out of the stands and punching an umpire several times over the course of a minute, and then ump slugging him....and nobody arrested?)Anyway, Bendix is very good and the supporting case, led by underrated actor Tom D'Andrea, is fun to watch, too.This film also will remind older film buffs of silent movie comedies with a wild scene at the end you have to see to believe. (Hint: Bendix winds up ""water skiing down city streets, being pulled by an ambulance).The second half of this twin-bill DVD, ""Safe At Home,"" is so bad it's not even worth discussing.
