186122,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,1572521945,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[0, 0]","""Nico Icon"" is a fascinating documentary about Andy Warhol's Factory Girl icon-- the mononomous Nico. A cold,Teutonic diva, she had grown up in harrowing times in the waning days of WWII. She came to New York City, fearful of her own beauty. Andy Warhol found her presence magnetic, and had her sing with his startup band the Velvet Underground. She was on the forefront of experimental rock. She clashed stylistically with Lou Reed and John Cale, but she made their album one of the most notable ever made.Nico eventually struck out on her own. Lou Reed was her paramour for awhile, then Jackson Browne who was her collaborator for ""Chelsea Girl."" Ironically, while Nico was one of the first fashion icons, she was also one of the first fangirls. After meeting Jim Morrison at a party,she built a shrine to him, lighting votive candles--WHILE HE WAS STILL ALIVE. They were briefly lovers--but it's understandable the Lizard King had such a powerful pull on women.Nico's solo career was a long spiral of self-destruction. She was proud of her ravaged skin, the needle marks on her arms, her deteriorating teeth. She brought tons of heroin on her tours.""Nico Icon"" is a tragic documentary. It's compelling, melancholy viewing.",5,Factory Girl,1254614400,"10 4, 2009",2009,1225,"['Nico', 'Icon', 'fascinating', 'documentary', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'Factory', 'Girl', 'icon', 'mononomous', 'Nico', 'A', 'cold', 'Teutonic', 'diva', 'had', 'grown', 'up', 'harrowing', 'times', 'waning', 'days', 'WWII', 'came', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'fearful', 'own', 'beauty', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'found', 'presence', 'magnetic', 'had', 'sing', 'startup', 'band', 'Velvet', 'Underground', 'was', 'forefront', 'experimental', 'rock', 'clashed', 'stylistically', 'Lou', 'Reed', 'John', 'Cale', 'made', 'album', 'one', 'most', 'notable', 'ever', 'made.Nico', 'eventually', 'struck', 'out', 'own', 'Lou', 'Reed', 'was', 'paramour', 'awhile', 'then', 'Jackson', 'Browne', 'who', 'was', 'collaborator', 'Chelsea', 'Girl', 'Ironically', 'Nico', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'fashion', 'icons', 'was', 'also', 'one', 'first', 'fangirls', 'meeting', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'party', 'built', 'shrine', 'lighting', 'votive', 'candles', 'HE', 'WAS', 'STILL', 'ALIVE', 'were', 'briefly', 'lovers', 'understandable', 'Lizard', 'King', 'had', 'such', 'powerful', 'pull', 'women.Nico', 'solo', 'career', 'was', 'long', 'spiral', 'self-destruction', 'was', 'proud', 'ravaged', 'skin', 'needle', 'marks', 'arms', 'deteriorating', 'teeth', 'brought', 'tons', 'heroin', 'tours', 'Nico', 'Icon', 'tragic', 'documentary', 'compelling', 'melancholy', 'viewing']",N/A

As a biography, the  film is weak, short on information, with a limited and jaded  perspective.As a tribute, it fails miserably. I'm still uncertain where  ICON fits in the whole picture aside from looking good in the title. There  is little substance in the film  to suggest she `earned' any sort of  recognition, stature, or approval from anyone but miscreants and lost  souls. From my vantagepoint her life seems little different than many  misguided college youth who gave up their lives to confusion and drugs, far  too early. It's a tragic tale, I guess, but far from distinctive.The  whole deal is some sort of inside joke and I sit outside,  unfortunately--maybe it all got lost in the translation.",1,Don&#65533;t waste your time.,953856000,"03 24, 2000",2000,980,"['Came', 'film', 'few', 'good', 'recommendations', 'knowledge', 'woman', 'Christa', 'Paffgen', 'NICO', 'whom', 'documentary', 'based.NICO', 'young', 'German', 'woman', 'model', 'created', 'image', 'conjunction', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'group', 'asexual', 'junkie', 'biography', 'film', 'weak', 'short', 'information', 'limited', 'jaded', 'perspective.As', 'tribute', 'miserably', ""'m"", 'still', 'uncertain', 'where', 'ICON', 'whole', 'picture', 'aside', 'looking', 'good', 'title', 'little', 'substance', 'film', 'suggest', 'earned', 'sort', 'recognition', 'stature', 'approval', 'anyone', 'miscreants', 'lost', 'souls', 'vantagepoint', 'life', 'little', 'different', 'many', 'misguided', 'college', 'youth', 'who', 'gave', 'up', 'lives', 'confusion', 'drugs', 'far', 'too', 'early', 'tragic', 'tale', 'guess', 'far', 'distinctive.The', 'whole', 'deal', 'sort', 'inside', 'joke', 'sit', 'outside', 'unfortunately', 'maybe', 'got', 'lost', 'translation']",N/A
186124,A2HIWDD2TDXS19,1572521945,F. Gentile,"[17, 20]","I first heard of Nico many years ago. I vaguely remember her as the epitome of Nordic beauty, who sang with The Velvet Underground and consequently was associated with Andy Warhol. Knowing alot about Warhol history, I was aware that Nico was mostly remembered for her appearance and her non-communicative ways. In Underground recordings featuring Nico, I would have to agree with Warhol's appraisal of her vocal skills as the ""voice of a beautiful cow."" She seemed to be just another  of the many tragic, lost beauties, like Edie Sedgwick, who almost made it, but, not quite. In this interesting documentary, one gets to know Nico somewhat better. One of the main thoughts I came away with upon viewing this film is the sad feeling of wasted beauty. Though that commodity's value is questionable, and certainly fades with time, Nico's beauty, as viewed here in early stills and films, was shocking. It was not just the knowledge of what was to come that made me feel sadness at seeing this girls exquisite, flawless beauty. She was obviously too deep a person to just settle for being viewed as merely gorgeous. She was also a talented poet/songwriter, and I was very impressed with her ethereal later recordings seen and heard here. I certainly can't argue with her statement also heard here that her only regret was that she hadn't been born a man. No, beauty was not enough for her. What is sad to reflect upon is her deterioration into heroin addiction. She became what a bandmate here refers to as a ""middle aged junkie"", and the film seen here of Nico toward the end of her life is of a person that has become unrecognizable compared to the blonde ice goddess of not too many years before.  The fact that she also had a very young son, to whom she apparently provided a steady diet of potato chips, and basically abandoned to the kindly mother of the child's father, actor Alain Delon, and whose very presence obviously interfered with her wanderlust, makes any empathy with her hard to conjure up. Also hearing from her ex-lover that Nico got same son addicted to heroin is an extremely distasteful and unsympathetic thought. Yes, she had some talent. But, was she a troubled human being, whom we should pity, or simply selfish from birth? It is hard to say why she was the way she was. She died what appears to be a sad end in her 40's. In our culture there seems to be as much appeal for sad endings as there is for success stories. But, as I myself get older, and having had two close, smart, devestatingly gorgeous glamour girls of my own who met tragic ends through drugs and alcohol, I see nothing but sadness in loss of this kind, there is no glamour in it. Unlike Marilyn Monroe, who arguably was touched by God, the likes of Nico, Edie, Gia, and many before and after them, will more than likely  only be remembered by their families and those that knew their names , all of whom are diminishing with time. However, this film is of interest not only because it's the story of beauty lost, but it is well crafted and scored. All said, the overwhelming feeling of a life squandered and burned out too soon will probably prevent me from viewing it again.",4,Unknown Icon.,1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,3167,"['first', 'heard', 'Nico', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'vaguely', 'remember', 'epitome', 'Nordic', 'beauty', 'who', 'sang', 'Velvet', 'Underground', 'consequently', 'was', 'associated', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'Knowing', 'alot', 'Warhol', 'history', 'was', 'aware', 'Nico', 'was', 'mostly', 'remembered', 'appearance', 'non-communicative', 'ways', 'Underground', 'recordings', 'featuring', 'Nico', 'would', 'have', 'agree', 'Warhol', 'appraisal', 'vocal', 'skills', 'voice', 'beautiful', 'cow', 'seemed', 'be', 'just', 'many', 'tragic', 'lost', 'beauties', 'Edie', 'Sedgwick', 'who', 'almost', 'made', 'not', 'quite', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'one', 'know', 'Nico', 'somewhat', 'better', 'One', 'main', 'thoughts', 'came', 'away', 'upon', 'viewing', 'film', 'sad', 'feeling', 'wasted', 'beauty', 'commodity', 'value', 'questionable', 'certainly', 'fades', 'time', 'Nico', 'beauty', 'viewed', 'here', 'early', 'stills', 'films', 'was', 'shocking', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'knowledge', 'what', 'was', 'come', 'made', 'feel', 'sadness', 'seeing', 'girls', 'exquisite', 'flawless', 'beauty', 'was', 'obviously', 'too', 'deep', 'person', 'just', 'settle', 'being', 'viewed', 'merely', 'gorgeous', 'was', 'also', 'talented', 'poet/songwriter', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'ethereal', 'later', 'recordings', 'seen', 'heard', 'here', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'argue', 'statement', 'also', 'heard', 'here', 'only', 'regret', 'was', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'born', 'man', 'No', 'beauty', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'What', 'sad', 'reflect', 'upon', 'deterioration', 'heroin', 'addiction', 'became', 'what', 'bandmate', 'here', 'middle', 'aged', 'junkie', 'film', 'seen', 'here', 'Nico', 'end', 'life', 'person', 'become', 'unrecognizable', 'compared', 'blonde', 'ice', 'goddess', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'years', 'fact', 'also', 'had', 'very', 'young', 'son', 'whom', 'apparently', 'provided', 'steady', 'diet', 'potato', 'chips', 'basically', 'abandoned', 'kindly', 'mother', 'child', 'father', 'actor', 'Alain', 'Delon', 'very', 'presence', 'obviously', 'interfered', 'wanderlust', 'empathy', 'hard', 'conjure', 'up', 'Also', 'hearing', 'ex-lover', 'Nico', 'got', 'same', 'son', 'addicted', 'heroin', 'extremely', 'distasteful', 'unsympathetic', 'thought', 'Yes', 'had', 'talent', 'was', 'troubled', 'human', 'being', 'whom', 'should', 'pity', 'simply', 'selfish', 'birth', 'hard', 'say', 'why', 'was', 'way', 'was', 'died', 'what', 'be', 'sad', 'end', '40', 'culture', 'there', 'be', 'as', 'much', 'appeal', 'sad', 'endings', 'success', 'stories', 'myself', 'get', 'older', 'having', 'had', 'two', 'close', 'smart', 'devestatingly', 'gorgeous', 'glamour', 'girls', 'own', 'who', 'met', 'tragic', 'ends', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'see', 'nothing', 'sadness', 'loss', 'kind', 'glamour', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'who', 'arguably', 'was', 'touched', 'God', 'likes', 'Nico', 'Edie', 'Gia', 'many', 'before', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'only', 'be', 'remembered', 'families', 'knew', 'names', 'whom', 'are', 'diminishing', 'time', 'However', 'film', 'interest', 'not', 'only', 'story', 'beauty', 'lost', 'well', 'crafted', 'scored', 'said', 'overwhelming', 'feeling', 'life', 'squandered', 'burned', 'out', 'too', 'soon', 'will', 'probably', 'prevent', 'viewing', 'again']",N/A

186126,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,1572521945,Gregor von Kallahann,"[30, 35]","About midway through this documentary, former Warhol superstar Viva! makes the assertion that Nico had no inner life.  Then she quickly amends the statement and says that Nico had no inner life that anyone else could know.  Well, there is a vast difference there.  To imply that the woman who composed such unearthly song-poems as &quot;Frozen Warnings,&quot; &quot;Evening of Light,&quot;  and &quot;Julius Caesar (Memento Hodie)&quot; had no inner life is beyond preposterous.  Tell you what, Veev, get back to us with your insights once you've written anything half as good.As much as I respect this film (Susanne Ofteringer has unearthed a great deal of rare footage and assembled her documentary skillfully), I have my doubts that it will change many people's minds about Nico as an artist.  Too many still see her as some sort of top-flight groupie who recorded a few Jackson Browne and Lou Reed songs.  The cliches still abound, &quot;couldn't sing,&quot;  &quot;Warhol hanger-on,&quot;  &quot;Velvet Underground hanger-on.&quot;  Not that many really understand what she was about, and it's a shame.  At some point in the film, John Cale asserts that his work with Nico has yet to be seen for what it is--a genuine contribution to European classical music.Ofteringer does what she can to correct some of the misapprehensions about her subject.  But what many will come away with is the tragic story of a talented, beautiful woman who threw it all away.  That's part of Nico's story,of course.  But while I understand the impulse to refer to Nico as a &quot;failure&quot; (in commercial terms and in her personal life, she certainly was), it is a disservice to imply that she failed artistically.

This is not a film that will inspire gladness or even much admiration in the viewer, instead it is a dark meditation on how boredom and drugs destroyed one of the great visual icons of the late 1960s. It should be praised for capturing both a haunting portrait of a doomed artist and for diving deep into the darker side of the flower power era. The Beatles, hippies, even Vietnam, never make cameos in this film, and they shouldn't.""Nico Icon"" chronicles Nico's rise and fall beginning during her young years as a modeling phenomenon, gracing covers and ads with her tall, captivating presence. Director Susanne Oftenringer unearths some rare, priceless photos and film clips of the pre-Velvet Underground Nico where she looks like a gorgeous German precursor of the kind of glamourous starlets promoting perfume we see today at the local mall. But there was already a kind of depression inside of Nico the film tells us, she was very much alone with herself and confided in few people.Then comes New York and the Velvet Underground, the film gives us a fascinating look inside the world of Andy Warhol, The Factory and the birth of new forms of music which continue to influence the sounds of today. We hear and see rare clips of Nico singing, although her voice wasn't pitch perfect, she had a knack for good 60s pop. With the Underground she dived into darker, heavier territory, the usual classics are here including ""All Tomorrow's Parties"" and ""Venus In Furs."" Figures like John Cale and Danny Fields share their observations of Nico as a captivating figure who neverthless kept to herself. There are some especially fascinating moments where we learn about her affair with Doors frontman Jim Morrison, apparently Nico believed Morrison was the only person who truly understood her. Fields describes Morrison and Nico's first night together, including hair pulling and naked tip-toeing.It is after the 1960s that ""Nico Icon"" then turns really ugly as we see the fast crash and burn of our muse. Frightening interview clips show the toll drugs and booze took on Nico's beauty, by the 1980s she strolled around with rotten teeth and damaged skin, looking more like Linda Blair in ""The Exorcist"" than the Nordic beauty that seduced Lou Reed and Bob Dylan. We meet Nico's grown son Ari, who's life was poisoned from the beginning by his mother, she even turned him on to heroin, the vice that eventually consumed her. All this is captured with a haunting tone in the editing and music, with a lot of organ music framing the final sections of this harrowing movie.""Nico Icon"" is a rarity in films about the 60s. A lot has been said about the kind of youthful energy and hope of the times, or the revolutionary movements that enflamed the world, but here is one film that ignores the cliche 60s talking points and yet captures the history of the era so well. Nico in a sense WAS the 60s, a beautiful beginning with talent and promise, followed by a tragic downfall. This is more than anything however, the portrait of one person and her life. It is a life I doubt many of us would want to live, Nico comes across as a nice person who hated the world, people, and was bored with life itself, finding escape in drugs and hopelessness.

The film is spliced with interviews with legends like John Cale and Andy Warhol talking about one of their peers.  Peppered with pictures of one of the most beautiful singers ever, the film is also one of the seamiest this side of ""Bad Lieutenant"" or ""Requiem For A Dream.""  Vicious in her editing, filmmaker Susan Ofteringer quickly jumps from scenes of the beautiful Nico in the late 60s and early 70s, wooing Jim Morrison and Jackson Browne, to the decayed Nico of the mid-80s when she was shooting junk in tour vans and pulling knives on band members.  The film sets up those crazy days of youth when everyone was beautiful and indestructible and could live on rumour and reputation and even keep a small child in tow.  The interviews with John Cale, who sings a song (for Nico?) are just as haunting as the images of the woman, with her unearthly speaking and singing voice.  Also interviews with those no longer with us, like Andy Warhol or Sterling Morrison, are fantastic, as are select cuts from the Warhol films that feature the Velvet Underground and Nico.  One blip is the interview with Carlos de Maldonado-Bostock, a bohemian in Paris, whose credentials and connection to Nico are a bit mysterious.
