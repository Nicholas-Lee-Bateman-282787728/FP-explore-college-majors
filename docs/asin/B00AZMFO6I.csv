I would give it five stars if it weren't about performers.  I am very tired of performers--not while they are acting--but when they are consumed with telling their own stories.  They are, by and large, very tiresome people, often thinking they are important people just because they once played one, or received a standing ovation.  You know the type, they play Julius Cesar in High School, get a standing ovation, and then forever assume they are as important as old Julius.  Ultimately, this story is about tiresome people, being tiresome.But rather shortly after the movie started, I started to like some very briefly displayed characteristic of one of the very tiresome characters.  A mystery unfolded.  Would the spark catch?  Would the likable characteristic fade or blossom?  Would other blooms appear?  Would love triumph over tiresomeness?The movie is much like an old, barely attended garden in a languishing mansion's side yard.  It is near enough to the house that the very elderly widow who lives there steps out daily to sit on her wrought-iron throne.  From where she sits, there is still order and if not beauty, calming green, but from every other angle it is jungle.  One fine spring day, daffodils spring to bloom.  Long sleeping tulips peek toward the sky and offer surprising refinement.  A cherry tree breaks forth in song.  Old roses, long suffering, come into cascades of harmony.  The widow is provided with one last overwhelmingly beautiful view of glory before the garden succumbs to the jungle.",4,"Like an unusual chocolate bar, you don't know how much you will appreciate it 'till after it is eaten.",1376179200,"08 11, 2013",2013,1649,"['Very', 'few', 'movies', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'conceived', 'acted', 'directed', 'filmed', 'edited', ""n't"", 'just', 'gem', 'Faberge', 'Egg', 'would', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'were', ""n't"", 'performers', 'am', 'very', 'tired', 'performers', 'not', 'are', 'acting', 'when', 'are', 'consumed', 'telling', 'own', 'stories', 'are', 'large', 'very', 'tiresome', 'people', 'often', 'thinking', 'are', 'important', 'people', 'just', 'once', 'played', 'one', 'received', 'standing', 'ovation', 'know', 'type', 'play', 'Julius', 'Cesar', 'High', 'School', 'get', 'standing', 'ovation', 'then', 'forever', 'are', 'as', 'important', 'old', 'Julius', 'Ultimately', 'story', 'tiresome', 'people', 'being', 'tiresome.But', 'rather', 'shortly', 'movie', 'started', 'started', 'like', 'very', 'briefly', 'displayed', 'characteristic', 'one', 'very', 'tiresome', 'characters', 'mystery', 'unfolded', 'Would', 'spark', 'catch', 'Would', 'likable', 'characteristic', 'fade', 'blossom', 'Would', 'other', 'blooms', 'Would', 'love', 'triumph', 'tiresomeness', 'movie', 'much', 'old', 'barely', 'attended', 'garden', 'languishing', 'mansion', 'side', 'yard', 'near', 'enough', 'house', 'very', 'elderly', 'widow', 'who', 'steps', 'out', 'daily', 'sit', 'wrought-iron', 'throne', 'where', 'still', 'order', 'not', 'beauty', 'calming', 'green', 'other', 'angle', 'jungle', 'One', 'fine', 'spring', 'day', 'spring', 'bloom', 'Long', 'sleeping', 'tulips', 'peek', 'sky', 'offer', 'surprising', 'refinement', 'cherry', 'tree', 'breaks', 'forth', 'song', 'Old', 'long', 'suffering', 'come', 'cascades', 'harmony', 'widow', 'provided', 'one', 'last', 'overwhelmingly', 'beautiful', 'view', 'glory', 'garden', 'succumbs', 'jungle']",N/A
1619134,A39H1GO9E3YQIB,B00AZMFO6I,a,"[0, 0]","Director Dustin Hoffman plus an outstanding cast of talented British actors equals a warm, gentle film that's full of life and humor.  Taking place entirely at a nursing home for elderly musicians and opera stars, ""Quartet"" uses planning and rehearsals for an upcoming gala concert as the backdrop for an exploration of growing old, revisiting past mistakes and decisions, and coming to terms with one's strengths and abilities. Maggie Smith, Tom Courtenay, Pauline Collins, and the marvelous Billy Connolly are the leads in both the gala concert and the film itself.  All four are real characters, believably portrayed as fading opera talent. In particular, Connolly shines, while seemingly channeling John Cleese, as a likeable ""dirty old man,"" full of the randy sort of British humor I enjoyed growing up watching British comedies on PBS.  Michael Gambon briefly turns up, terrific as always, despite a minor one-dimensional role as the gala's overbearing and self-absorbed director.  And it's always wonderful to see the gracefully aging Andrew Sachs, perhaps best known as the waiter Manuel from ""Fawlty Towers.""  All in all, this is an ideal cast for a strong storyline about aging, full of crisp and witty dialogue and just enough sentimental poignancy to not appear cloying.  It avoids some of the more obvious cliches.  I was waiting, around the sixty-minute mark, for one of the minor characters to die simply to reinforce the theme of mortality and move the narrative along. Although we eventually got a little something similar, it was deftly handled, and I was pleasantly surprised by the film's originality in tackling issues that have been played onscreen time and again.I will, however, agree with those critics who say that ""Quartet"" presents too idyllic an environment to be totally convincing.  As one reviewer pointed out, there are no oxygen tanks at Beecham House. Indeed, most of these elderly musicians seem quite happy and content unless the plot demands that they spend a few moments staring pensively into the distance. We certainly see how mental decline among the elderly is a serious issue, but it is treated so gently and occasionally with light comedy that it's hard to think of any of these characters as truly suffering from dementia or similar.  Their home and grounds are beautifully picturesque and staffed by amazing young people who seem to understand and appreciate the elderly - circumstances that are pretty outrageous for anyone who has ever spent any length of time in a real nursing home among often frustrated staff members.  But in the end, who cares about all that?  That's not the point of this film, and its occasional lack of realism did not take away from the performances nor my appreciation of the film.  My spouse was a bit harsher, finding the conclusion a bit rushed and troubled by some of the character development - how quickly characters changed their minds about circumstances and things of that nature.  We both agreed, however, that it was still an excellent film and one that can easily be recommended to the old and the young.",4,"A gentle film, full of life and humor",1372118400,"06 25, 2013",2013,3092,"['Director', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'talented', 'British', 'actors', 'equals', 'warm', 'gentle', 'film', 'full', 'life', 'humor', 'Taking', 'place', 'entirely', 'nursing', 'home', 'elderly', 'musicians', 'opera', 'stars', 'Quartet', 'planning', 'rehearsals', 'upcoming', 'gala', 'concert', 'backdrop', 'exploration', 'growing', 'old', 'revisiting', 'past', 'mistakes', 'decisions', 'coming', 'terms', 'one', 'strengths', 'abilities', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Tom', 'Courtenay', 'Pauline', 'Collins', 'marvelous', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'are', 'leads', 'gala', 'concert', 'film', 'four', 'are', 'real', 'characters', 'believably', 'portrayed', 'fading', 'opera', 'talent', 'particular', 'Connolly', 'shines', 'seemingly', 'channeling', 'John', 'Cleese', 'likeable', 'dirty', 'old', 'man', 'full', 'randy', 'sort', 'British', 'humor', 'enjoyed', 'growing', 'up', 'watching', 'British', 'comedies', 'PBS', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'briefly', 'up', 'terrific', 'always', 'minor', 'one-dimensional', 'role', 'gala', 'overbearing', 'self-absorbed', 'director', 'always', 'wonderful', 'see', 'gracefully', 'aging', 'Andrew', 'Sachs', 'perhaps', 'best', 'known', 'waiter', 'Manuel', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'ideal', 'cast', 'strong', 'storyline', 'aging', 'full', 'crisp', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'just', 'enough', 'sentimental', 'poignancy', 'not', 'appear', 'cloying', 'more', 'obvious', 'cliches', 'was', 'waiting', 'sixty-minute', 'mark', 'one', 'minor', 'characters', 'die', 'simply', 'reinforce', 'theme', 'mortality', 'move', 'narrative', 'along', 'eventually', 'got', 'little', 'something', 'similar', 'was', 'deftly', 'handled', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'film', 'originality', 'tackling', 'issues', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'onscreen', 'time', 'again.I', 'will', 'however', 'agree', 'critics', 'who', 'say', 'Quartet', 'presents', 'too', 'idyllic', 'environment', 'be', 'totally', 'convincing', 'one', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'are', 'oxygen', 'tanks', 'Beecham', 'House', 'Indeed', 'most', 'elderly', 'musicians', 'seem', 'quite', 'happy', 'content', 'plot', 'spend', 'few', 'moments', 'staring', 'pensively', 'distance', 'certainly', 'see', 'how', 'mental', 'decline', 'elderly', 'serious', 'issue', 'treated', 'so', 'gently', 'occasionally', 'light', 'comedy', 'hard', 'think', 'characters', 'truly', 'suffering', 'dementia', 'similar', 'home', 'grounds', 'are', 'beautifully', 'picturesque', 'staffed', 'amazing', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'seem', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'elderly', 'circumstances', 'are', 'pretty', 'outrageous', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'spent', 'length', 'time', 'real', 'nursing', 'home', 'often', 'frustrated', 'staff', 'members', 'end', 'who', 'not', 'point', 'film', 'occasional', 'lack', 'realism', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'performances', 'appreciation', 'film', 'spouse', 'was', 'bit', 'harsher', 'finding', 'conclusion', 'bit', 'rushed', 'troubled', 'character', 'development', 'how', 'quickly', 'characters', 'changed', 'minds', 'circumstances', 'things', 'nature', 'agreed', 'however', 'was', 'still', 'excellent', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'recommended', 'old', 'young']",N/A

My main problem with the movie: how to get past the implausibility that Maggie Smith - whose well-known voice seems bereft of any oomph and power - is somehow one of the world's best singers (albeit one past her prime)?  I wondered how Hoffman would finesse that at the film's payoff moment, when the four protagonists meet on stage: lip syncing? Smith's character turning tail? Ultimately, the director takes another path, but it's one that pays heed to this reality.On the other hand, the supporting players require no such artful dodging.  Hoffman filled out his cast from the UK's finest actors, singers and musicians from the 50s, 60s and 70s.  As he stated in any interview, these are people ""whose phones stopped ringing years ago for no good reason.""  In that same interview, he noted their collective gratitude and willingness to work hard, age no matter.  That comes through on the screen.  Ultimately, what sticks with you is not the four main characters, but rather the small, sublime performances that the director lays in from these pros who still have their chops.  Of special note: ""Are You Havin' Any Fun?"" performed by David Ryall, Ronnie Fox and Trevor Peacock. It's a ditty that has stuck in my head since I saw it.And, it almost goes without saying that Michael Gambon's usual scene-stealing shtick is set on full power here and is well-worth the ride as always.",3,"Slight, but enjoyable - supporting cast makes it worth your time",1377907200,"08 31, 2013",2013,1453,"['directorial', 'debut', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'slight', 'enjoyable', 'main', 'problem', 'movie', 'how', 'get', 'implausibility', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'well-known', 'voice', 'bereft', 'oomph', 'power', 'somehow', 'one', 'world', 'best', 'singers', 'one', 'past', 'prime', 'wondered', 'how', 'Hoffman', 'would', 'finesse', 'film', 'payoff', 'moment', 'when', 'four', 'protagonists', 'meet', 'stage', 'lip', 'syncing', 'Smith', 'character', 'turning', 'tail', 'Ultimately', 'director', 'path', 'one', 'heed', 'reality.On', 'other', 'hand', 'supporting', 'players', 'require', 'such', 'artful', 'dodging', 'Hoffman', 'filled', 'out', 'cast', 'UK', 'finest', 'actors', 'singers', 'musicians', '50s', '60s', '70s', 'stated', 'interview', 'are', 'people', 'phones', 'stopped', 'ringing', 'years', 'ago', 'good', 'reason', 'same', 'interview', 'noted', 'collective', 'gratitude', 'willingness', 'work', 'hard', 'age', 'matter', 'through', 'screen', 'Ultimately', 'what', 'not', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'rather', 'small', 'sublime', 'performances', 'director', 'pros', 'who', 'still', 'have', 'chops', 'special', 'note', 'Are', 'Havin', 'Any', 'Fun', 'performed', 'David', 'Ryall', 'Ronnie', 'Fox', 'Trevor', 'Peacock', 'ditty', 'stuck', 'head', 'saw', 'it.And', 'almost', 'saying', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'usual', 'scene-stealing', 'shtick', 'set', 'full', 'power', 'here', 'well-worth', 'ride', 'always']",N/A

Anyone familiar with assisted living facilities know what a fantasy this movie is. This one saving grace for the film, is that  it may well serve to underscore how poor many such ""homes"" are. This ""Beecham House"" is grand and opulent alright...it's what we all wish for. Sadly few of us will ever experience anything close to this . We should. My loved one works in just these environments. It is not uncommon for a ""participant"" to have to be shown where the bathroom is every day-although one such woman could still play the piano beautifully! Couching octegenarians in visual comfort and beauty to me would be a noble thing for any civilized society to think about seriously. So the concept is a good one, and we thank Dustin for his foray into producing and directing.My objection has to do with movie houses in general, and in particular the sound, the voices, the dialogue. You've experienced, those of you over 60,...loss of some eyesight and hearing...and straining to hear what is being said! I am not the only person to complain bitterly about the abominable work by so called sound technicians. It's likely they have ""golden ears""...meaning they can have background noises or music at 86  decibels, and the voices, the speech at 77 decibels...and hear it all just fine. Not the rest of us! a 9 decibel spread means you ""halve"" the loudness, halve it again, and halve that again...and there you have the speech, burried under a mound of pillows. Add to that, the deplorable trend in all movies today of mumbling...lips not moving at alll, all speech gargled in the back of the throat. If the sound technician rather knows that people over 60 will be coming to the theater...to overlook the fact that they can't hear well borders on cruelty. I heard, perhaps, one tenth of the dialogues! That left me with one thing only...read body language, and just enjoy the  scenery..and short snippets of music. Building ever more clsoely to the grand quartet finale, alas, we discover our fabulous actors can't sing!...We are treated to the gloriously beautiful quartet during during the titles ONLY at the end of the movie ! !...some professionals singing it. This all by itself is anticlimactic. So we feel cheated a bit, misled, but worst of all...cheated out of hearing what they were all saying!Now of course all the bombastic pre-movie ads, and stunning graphics...is accompanied by THUNDEROUS sound...up there with a NASCAR race track...then the movie begins, and the sound pressure level drops by a good 80%. And you sit there thinking...oh hell! Why do they do that? I'm sure producers have steered movies toward everyone under 25...thinking, oh old people don't matter, and don't care about movies. Yes we do! The movie industry doesn't care enough to make certain actors speak clearly and distinctly. Remember Humphry Bogart? John Wayne? I can think of dozens more...all of whom spoke clearly. But not these sorry excuses for actors today, and their sorry excuses for sound technicians. This oversight makes this movie one soon to be forgotten. Think about this....there were about 6 people in the movie house!  And still the movie industry doesn't understand why? I'm telling them why. Those of us who can afford to go to the movies can't hear what is being said! And a young people are just 'downloading' movies, ...which is NOT going to the movies! This is the hand writing on the wall for the end of movie houses. Six people! Sheesh. That is a wretched failure on the part of everyone involved.

Alas, this movie takes some elegant actors, incredible cinematography, great saturation of colors and makes the script appear more as a stage production than what real people would say in actual situations. Yes, I know it's adapted from a stage production, but it shouldn't be so obvious. Where the actors stood, the way they interacted, I never lost sight of the fact that the people were actors.

This film has all of those expected elements, yet somehow manages to be thoroughly watchable if sometimes maudlin. The acting is wonderful, and might also be expected from a batch of old pros like Dame Maggie, Pauline Collins, Billy Connolly (who just gets more and more delightful with every film) and Tom Courtenay, who I haven't seen in a film in ages, but who provides a needed gravitas to the formula. Michael Gambon plays an egoistic divo with aplomb. What lends extra charm is the musical performances, and don't miss the final credits, which show the actors/musicians (including Gwyneth Jones, who can still knock out a nice ""Visi D'arte"") as they were in their salad days.

The annual feconcert fundraiser is being planned to coincide with Verdi's birthday and heading the committee is Cedric Livingston, played by Michael Gambon.  Also on the committee is Cissy Robson, beautifully performed by Pauline Collins, who is ""getting forgetful""  and her old stage buddy, Wilf Bond raucously played by Billy Connolly who delights in flirting with all the women and makes a hobby of needling Cedric.  Another resident, Reggie Paget, an outstanding performance by Tom Courtenay, who came to the home to check on his old buddy Wilf who had been admitted after a slight stroke.  Reg never left and found his niche in caring for his friends and holding classes for young people.  The scene in the classroom where he makes the comparison between rap and opera is delightful!Into the idealic setting comes the grouchy diva, a noted opera singer, Jean Horton, played by Maggie Smith.  Her arrival shakes up Reg who she was very briefly married to years ago, and turns his world upside down.  She also brings out the evil eye in an old rival, Anne Langley (Gwyneth Jones).I love Maggie Smith, a great actress, but couldn't get used to her childish behavior in this role, too much Downton I guess. The entire cast from the colorful main characters to the extras and minor bits are all exquisite.  Beautiful, touching performances by all.

Also in the film are several ""ringers,"" real-life members of British royal orchestras and opera companies who play residents of the home, and who perform throughout the film. Hoffman's film explores issues of aging -- of lives piled high with lost loves, failing health and former glories -- but does so without belittling or trivializing the characters.  It's also a sweet celebration of art and creativity, and the kind of buoyant, intelligent personalities that make great art. The script and direction share a light, subtle touch, and the magnificent cast hit exactly the right tone, making this one of the most enjoyable, intelligent, mature films I've seen in a long time.

Billy Connolly's Wilf is an incorrigible flirt, with a penchant for finding alcohol stashed away in a greenhouse.  Tom Courtenay's Reggie, a retired opera singer, tries to come to terms with his past; especially when he encounters his ex-wife Jean (Maggie Smith), a proud operatic diva forced to live at the home because she has no money.  The two of them begin by not speaking to each other, but their relationship softens in the end.

Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[1, 1]","It might be tempting to dismiss Dustin Hoffman's ""Quartet"" as a conventional film about the indignities of old age if not for its clever and humorous screenplay, sublime music, and magnificent performances.  Adapted for the screen by Ronald Harwood from his 1999 stage play, ""Quartet"" is set on the beautiful grounds of the Beecham House for Retired Musicians, where elderly performers happily interact, sing, and play their instruments. Every year, these talented men and women put on a gala concert.  This year, the event has special significance, since Beecham needs a substantial infusion of money if it is to remain open.The residents of Beecham are shocked and excited by the arrival of Jean Horton, portrayed by the incomparable Maggie Smith, who has made a career out of playing imperious, disdainful, and lonely women.  Horton, a former opera singer, sacrificed her personal life for professional success. Reginald Paget (the brilliant Tom Courtenay) is appalled that he will be forced to face Jean, his former wife whom he adored--until she broke his heart.  Another source of dramatic conflict is whether or not Jean will join Reggie, the randy and wisecracking Wilf Bond (Billy Connolly is a standout, thanks to his impeccable comic timing), and the increasingly forgetful Cissy Robson (Pauline Collins), in a quartet from Rigoletto that the four once sang together to great acclaim.Although the ending is a bit pat and predictable, ""Quartet"" is still a delight--droll, touching, and an affirmation of the power of music to unite, inspire, and enrich our lives, no matter how old or young we happen to be. Be sure to watch the terrific bonus features in which the actors pay homage to their director, Dustin Hoffman.  His empathy, good judgment, knowledge, and skill impressed even Maggie Smith (who, it has been said, is not easily impressed).",5,"""You must understand.

If it is intended for the over-sixties, its gratuitous coarseness may put many of that audience off. If it is intended for lovers of classical music, the chopped-up snippets of opera, interspersed with Bach & Zumba, certainly will do so (I couldn't believe the sloppy job of sound editing, which removed a couple of bars from a splendid 'cello rendition of Saint-Saens' ""Dying Swan"": absolutely unforgivable!). I was especially cross that the promised quartet never materialised, except as a 'voiceover' with the end credits. I realise that neither Smith or the others are real singers, and that dubbing believable ageing voices would have been unthinkable, but the rehearsals of the eponymous quartet--drowned out by a Bach fugue--and then the story coming to an abrupt end--with Pavarotti and the rest singing the real quartet from ""Rigoletto"" as the credits rolled--seemed a bit of a cheat.I adore both Maggie Smith and Michael Gambon, who bring a touch of class to anything they do. Of the other actors, Tom Courteney, as Maggie's former husband and singing partner, was likeable, but for some reason I did not believe that the members of the once-and-future quartet had ever been opera singers. I found Billy Connolly just plain annoying, and I thought the comely blond Doctor totally implausible as the director of a care home, whether for retired singers or not. The group of elderly actors, including Andrew Sachs (Manuel in ""Fawlty Towers"") and Dame Gwyneth Jones, are wonderful old troupers, and the film is a splendid stage for them to shine their brightest.I think that Dustin Hoffman's heart is in the right place and that the film was well intended (The end credits, which feature pictures of the musician-actors as they are in the movie and as they were during their real careers, are both moving and splendid!), but I simply was not convinced by his handling of the actors.A quartet is an ensemble, and unfortunately I never felt that the characters ever quite came together; whether the fault is with the director or the writer I am uncertain.

The concept of a sound one - what happens to retired musicians who can no longer care for themselves after years of glory before the public has accompanied them to the station of being elderly and in need of assistance? Turning this situation into a comedy takes taste and restraint and Harwood delivers both - as does Hoffman.In Beecham House, a home for retired musicians Cecily (Pauline Collins), Reggie (Tom Courtenay), Wilfred (Billy Connolly) and Cedric (Michael Gambon) are preparing plans for the annual October 10 concert to celebrate Verdi's birthday - and to raise funds so that Beecham House can survive. They are tended by Dr. Lucy Cogan (Sheridan Smith) who manages to fend off sexual advances from Wilfred while assisting the entire ensemble in their participation. All goes relatively smoothly until the arrival of the newest tenant, MegaDiva Jean Horton (Maggie Smith) arrives on the scene (Jean is Reggie's ex-wife, a divorce that didn't end amicably). When informed that she must participate in the Verdi gala, Jean refuses and the rest of the film is the interaction of the other residents with Jean and how Jean manages to change her attitude - and heart.The film gently shows the comical aspects of approaching senility in some and the personality quirks in others. The story is slight but does carry a warm message. It is not until the end of the film that we discover that the majority of `actors' who appear as residents in Beecham House are in truth retire and aging stars of yesteryear. They deserve mention here: Andrew Sachs, Dame Gwyneth Jones, Trevor Peacock, David Ryall, Michael Byrne, Ronnie Fox, Aleksandra Duczmal, Denis Khoroshko, Sarah Crowden, Colin Bradbury, Patricia Varley, Ronnie Hughes, Jack Honeyborne, John Rawnsley, Nuala Willis, Melodie Waddingham, Cynthia Morey, John Heley, Graeme Scott, John Georgiadis, Ita Herbert and Ania Duczmal.The quartet members and Gambon do a fine job and the audience is left with an appreciation for the path down which we all are eventually headed.

1619275,A13TO5TU4A68LD,B00AZMFO6I,Gryphonisle,"[9, 20]","If you're going to make a movie about opera singers, the first rule is to cast someone who is at least plausible in the role.  Maggie Smith is one of my favorite actresses, and I'd go see a door open if she was in it, but, despite all her formidable talents, nothing about her suggests that she's got the ability to loft an aria.  She doesn't open her mouth wide enough to to get much more than an acidic remark through, and with a voice somewhere between sand paper and a cat's purr.  Meryl Streep would have been a much better choice.  Fortunately, Dustin Hoffman spares us the embarrassment of having to listen to her try, but with what amounts to a swindle;  we know that we've just been robbed, but of something we were so nervous about being caught with that it's something of a relief.  Still...This should not be interpreted as a slur against the talent in this movie.  The Quartet of actors at the center, while not from the Opera, are a diverse bunch of experienced actors that are a pleasure to watch, and the cast in the background is largely composed of former opera divas, cast members, and symphony orchestra members.  Something like ""Sunset Boulevard"" although as noted, Maggie Smith is not to Opera, what Gloria Swanson was to the Silent Screen.And, it's something of a relief that the trailer doesn't give everything away.  It turns out that, even with the ""F""bomb, it's Maggie Smith's character who's to blame, not the gentleman.  It seems that Tom Courtenay and Smith's characters were very briefly married until someone went astray and an attempt at honesty misfired and, well time passes very quickly...  In any case, the love story is one of two plots that intertwine within the main story, that being the need to have a concert to raise funds such that the grand old English country home can be preserved as a home for aged Musicians.  The old hams have to sing for their bread.  Why not, the Girl Scouts have to do it.  Thus, when Smith lands at the coop, the Quartet is once again together, so logically it would seem they should be the top bill of the night.  Maggie Smith's  Jean, disagrees, and that's the movie, well, getting past that...About that ""F"" Bomb.  Apparently Ms. Smith swears like a sailor off stage, and while I have no problem with that, I wouldn't have minded if she played a character more like herself, off stage (whatever that may be), where such language might be more integral to the story.  Having a woman of such dignity suddenly spout vulgarisms is a bit tacky.  What next?  Nudity?  Diane Keaton did it.  Must we see them all naked?Maggie Smith is big these days.  Movies about and for an older audience are big money makers.  It's a bit much to expect everything she's in to be like ""A Room With A View"" or ""Downton Abbey"".  I don't think this will be listed among her best movies.  If you wait until it's available to be streamed, then you'll save a quite a bit of money and may well find this movie to be more to your liking.  I went out to the theater, which I rarely do these days, sat through the commercials and spent over $30. for two people with a popcorn and diet coke, and it's not worth nearly that much effort and money.

Maggie Smith shines in any film she graces. Add in Tom Courtney, Billy Connolly, Pauline Collins and Michael Gambon, and we have a dream cast. Unfortunately, the film is uninspired and rather sad. Beecham House is a retirement home for singers and musicians and it is about to have a glorious new resident in opera sensation Jean Horton (Maggie Smith). It's not clear how this cast ended up in what seems more like an assisted living facility than a retirement home. Most residents seem to be in reasonable good health. Are there destitute and needing to live in a group home for the elderly? It seems like these acclaimed singers and musicians are now alone in the world with only each other.Horton arrives just in time for rehearsals for a gala event to keep their home open. Does Beecham House run on charity? Again, it is unclear as to why Beecham House is short on funds. Horton is asked to join a quartet that includes her very bitter ex-husband. Old wounds have festered through the decades. This is not a happy group of people except for eternally cheerful and confused Cecily Robson (Pauline Collins).Although Tom Courtenay and Billy Connolly have aged well, time does not seem to have been good to the residents. Rather than being an inspirational film about enjoy life in later years, QUARTET seems to be the story of once famous people fading into oblivion looking for one last hurrah. Ironically, in a bonus feature, someone mentions the film as a ""comedy."" It seemed rather sad to me. Hopefully, others see it differently. I was disappointed in a film that has such a marvelous cast and director.Be sure to watch the credits. There are some bittersweet pictures of the cast members as they are in the film and as they were in their prime. Most of the cast worked in theater and were once well-known stage actors and musicians. Opera and classic music are the keys here. Beecham House is actually full of aging opera singers s there are no 70-year-old rock stars living in residence. Mick Jagger won't be moving in any time soon. I wondered how these people had fallen so far that they were now in Beecham House. Was it health or financial issues or just a chance to live with old friends in their twilight years? They do live in a lovely home on a stately English estate but had they forsaken families and friends for their careers? The setting is delightful. The residents seem happy and they do band together for the annual gala but what about the rest of the year?

1619287,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00AZMFO6I,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[4, 4]","Only the BBC and Great Britain could produce such a film on retired musical artists, mostly musicians and opera singers. They are not guaranteed a long, slow and inactive aging period leading to their eventual dismissal but they are expected to go on practicing their arts, singing and playing, together if possible? and performing a few times a year to remain active and hence not simply survive but still create, produce, and enrich their collective lot, not out of pity or from charity from the public but because they provide that public with all kinds of real services, classes, lectures, concerts, etc.This film is exceptional since the average age of the actors is 178 or is it 198 years, so says one of them, but they are escaping depression and self-abandonment because they perform together for themselves and for a public that they invite, that come to learn from them. That film is a beautiful gospel of hope for the aging population in our countries. They must not be dependent, even and especially on the state, but they must keep the control of their life and their economic resources. A man can only be a man if he produces added value and that does not stop when you retire. Retiring is a humane solution for those who don't have their physical and mental health or enough of these physical and mental means to still be able to create, to teach, to bring something to other people, younger people or not so young people. In international humanitarian NGOs one can volunteer up to the age of NINETY-NINE years.So this film, produced and directed by the aging Dustin Hoffman (he is seventy-five years old, since he was a child of the New Deal), is the proof that life and the show must go on, no matter what. The film is full of empathy, humor, living power and force, constant and permanent energy: what am I going to do today? Of course I am going to play some music, do some singing, read a book, but also meet the others here and do these things with them, with passion, with emotion, with sympathy and at times compassion. I will share my emotions and passions with the others who will share their passions and emotions with me. I may take a walk and sit in the garden, go down town and enjoy looking at the cars going by, the children getting out of school, the salespeople in the stores where I will buy a trinket or a ballpoint pen just to be able to speak to the salesperson there. I may flirt or simply be nice and friendly with the unknown people I meet at the bus stop or in the streetcar, on the train, or anywhere indeed. Most of them will either shrug me off silently or just answer nicely: I have the age that brings respect and even help if I need some, and a few words often are all the help I need.People around me are just like elephants in the jungle. If I don't block the way, they may go by without noticing me, or smile at me for no reason whatsoever except that I am old enough to be smiled at, or even provided with a few words and a hand to hold a door, to help me up or down some stairs.This film is just showing this macrocosmic reality of aging in a society that does not seem to age at all, along with the microcosmic reality of everyday tensions, emotions, feelings, happiness or satisfaction. And the film shows how you must not overdo it. That's when you really get senile: you don't see others at all and you escape into an invisible reality that is only material in your mind, or you invade the people around you with your own sentiments, feelings and obsessions without seeing that it is not an exchange but a drone from your mind onto the people around you.And when that balance is kept, between these two extremes, you can have some very pleasant moments of real sharing that will enlighten your life, and their life, till the end of the trip. Yes indeed the objective is to get married again with the people of your generation, and also with people from younger generations, and marriage is sharing and doing together. That's what marriage for all means for me.A very sensitive and endearing film about an essential stake of the present and the coming decades.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,Aging can be the most beautiful experience in life,1365206400,"04 6, 2013",2013,4136,"['Only', 'BBC', 'Great', 'Britain', 'could', 'produce', 'film', 'retired', 'musical', 'artists', 'mostly', 'musicians', 'opera', 'singers', 'are', 'not', 'guaranteed', 'long', 'slow', 'inactive', 'aging', 'period', 'leading', 'eventual', 'dismissal', 'are', 'expected', 'go', 'practicing', 'arts', 'singing', 'playing', 'together', 'possible', 'performing', 'few', 'times', 'year', 'remain', 'active', 'hence', 'not', 'simply', 'survive', 'still', 'create', 'produce', 'enrich', 'collective', 'lot', 'not', 'pity', 'charity', 'public', 'provide', 'public', 'kinds', 'real', 'services', 'classes', 'lectures', 'concerts', 'etc.This', 'film', 'exceptional', 'average', 'age', 'actors', '178', '198', 'years', 'so', 'one', 'are', 'escaping', 'depression', 'self-abandonment', 'perform', 'together', 'public', 'invite', 'come', 'learn', 'film', 'beautiful', 'gospel', 'hope', 'aging', 'population', 'countries', 'must', 'not', 'be', 'dependent', 'even', 'especially', 'state', 'must', 'keep', 'control', 'life', 'economic', 'resources', 'man', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'man', 'added', 'value', 'not', 'stop', 'when', 'retire', 'Retiring', 'humane', 'solution', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'physical', 'mental', 'health', 'enough', 'physical', 'mental', 'means', 'still', 'be', 'able', 'create', 'teach', 'bring', 'something', 'other', 'people', 'younger', 'people', 'not', 'so', 'young', 'people', 'international', 'humanitarian', 'NGOs', 'one', 'can', 'volunteer', 'up', 'age', 'NINETY-NINE', 'years.So', 'film', 'produced', 'directed', 'aging', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'seventy-five', 'years', 'old', 'was', 'child', 'New', 'Deal', 'proof', 'life', 'show', 'must', 'go', 'matter', 'what', 'film', 'full', 'empathy', 'humor', 'living', 'power', 'force', 'constant', 'permanent', 'energy', 'what', 'am', 'going', 'do', 'today', 'course', 'am', 'going', 'play', 'music', 'do', 'singing', 'read', 'book', 'also', 'meet', 'others', 'here', 'do', 'things', 'passion', 'emotion', 'sympathy', 'times', 'compassion', 'will', 'share', 'emotions', 'passions', 'others', 'who', 'will', 'share', 'passions', 'emotions', 'may', 'take', 'walk', 'sit', 'garden', 'go', 'down', 'town', 'enjoy', 'looking', 'cars', 'going', 'children', 'getting', 'school', 'salespeople', 'stores', 'where', 'will', 'buy', 'trinket', 'ballpoint', 'pen', 'just', 'be', 'able', 'speak', 'salesperson', 'there', 'may', 'flirt', 'simply', 'be', 'nice', 'friendly', 'unknown', 'people', 'meet', 'bus', 'stop', 'streetcar', 'train', 'anywhere', 'indeed', 'Most', 'will', 'shrug', 'off', 'silently', 'just', 'answer', 'nicely', 'have', 'age', 'respect', 'even', 'help', 'need', 'few', 'words', 'often', 'are', 'help', 'need.People', 'are', 'just', 'elephants', 'jungle', 'do', ""n't"", 'block', 'way', 'may', 'go', 'noticing', 'smile', 'reason', 'whatsoever', 'am', 'old', 'enough', 'be', 'smiled', 'even', 'provided', 'few', 'words', 'hand', 'hold', 'door', 'help', 'up', 'stairs.This', 'film', 'just', 'showing', 'macrocosmic', 'reality', 'aging', 'society', 'not', 'seem', 'age', 'microcosmic', 'reality', 'everyday', 'tensions', 'emotions', 'feelings', 'happiness', 'satisfaction', 'film', 'how', 'must', 'not', 'overdo', 'when', 'really', 'get', 'senile', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'others', 'escape', 'invisible', 'reality', 'only', 'material', 'mind', 'invade', 'people', 'own', 'sentiments', 'feelings', 'obsessions', 'seeing', 'not', 'exchange', 'drone', 'mind', 'people', 'you.And', 'when', 'balance', 'kept', 'two', 'extremes', 'can', 'have', 'very', 'pleasant', 'moments', 'real', 'sharing', 'will', 'enlighten', 'life', 'life', 'till', 'end', 'trip', 'Yes', 'indeed', 'objective', 'get', 'married', 'again', 'people', 'generation', 'also', 'people', 'younger', 'generations', 'marriage', 'sharing', 'doing', 'together', 'what', 'marriage', 'means', 'me.A', 'very', 'sensitive', 'endearing', 'film', 'essential', 'stake', 'present', 'coming', 'decades.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

Opera singer Reggie, portrayed by Tom Courtenay, was deeply hurt many years ago when his wife, portrayed by Maggie Smith, also an opera singer, confessed she'd had an affair.  They were barely newlyweds at the time.  Unable to forgive her, they broke up.  Now, many, many years later, Reggie is living in a home for retired musicians when he discovers his ex-wife is its newest resident.  Oh, the unfairness of it all!  He was doing quite well in his golden years until SHE showed up.  I loved this delightful film.  Billy Connolly was so funny as Wilfred Bond.  He'd suffered a stroke and apparently had no control over certain impulses, especially the flirting impulse.

But there is a ""spanner (wrench) in the works"" when a former diva arrives, in the person of Maggie Smith. Based on the play by Ronald Harwood and directed by first-timer Dustin Hoffman, this delicious PG-13 comedy bathes us in classical music, witty dialogue and a lovely setting. In fact the opening credits include some of the finest editing I've had the pleasure to enjoy in recent years. Kudos to Barney Pilling for the film editing; Ben Smith for the art direction; and Dustin Hoffman for respecting the music.The world of opera is a relatively small one, so it is no surprise that a few of these divas and divos have a shared ""history,"" and therein lies our tale.Let's look at some of this wonderful cast:* Maggie Smith (""Downton Abbey"") is Jean, who always had at least 12 curtain calls but hasn't been in the spotlight for far too long!* Michael Gambon (""Harry Potter"") is Cedric, in charge of the star-studded gala, with a towering ego of his own.* Billy Connolly (""Brave"") is Wilf, proof positive that an old horn dog never quits sniffing around.* Tom Courtenay (""Gambit"") is Reggie, a kind, considerate fellow who is still nursing a broken heart.* Pauline Collins (""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"") is Cissy, the sweet busybody who can't think of one bad thing to say about anyone.Just a couple of important tips: 1) If you have any hearing problems, either see this in a theater that features closed captions, or wait for the DVD with Amazon.com so you can turn on the subtitles. 2) Be sure to stay through the final credits because Mr Hoffman generously included the faces of many of the performers, along with a head shot of that same performer during his or her heyday.

There is plenty of drama as they, and other musicians and singers, prepare for an annual concert fundraiser that will literally save their home. Old flames face off over decades-old affairs, prima donnas have not grown mellower with age, and sickness threatens to derail everyone's plans. It was wonderful that so many actual opera and music stars of past years participated in the film.Now, the downside.It was more than a little unbelievable that elderly singers were able to belt out arias as well as they could in their prime. Overdubbing was rampant. Decades-long doubts and animosities were vanquished in a trice. Debilitating sicknesses disappeared miraculously just in the time for the big show. ""Quartet"" is the kind of film that gets it laughs from seeing old folks drop F-bombs and from elderly men urinating in public and acting like horny teenagers. Not much effort went into trying to make the situations believable. The able actors, notably Maggie Smith, mostly mug their way through their scenes. Michael Gambon, dressed in Oriental gown jacket and cap, seems to reprise his role as Aldus Dumbledore, sans the beard and glasses. Thumbs down to Dustin Hoffman as the film's director.Still, the audience, made up of mostly of the elderly, loved the movie and gave it an ovation at the end.

Of the 4 main characters, the only one who didn't come across as a complete fool was Tom Courtenay, who plays her ex-husband.  Billy Connelly, as the randy stoke survivor, and obvious comic relief, even started to get obnoxious after a while.Sadly, I blame this on Dustin Hoffman, who was a first time director of the film.

1619353,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00AZMFO6I,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","For its impressive cast alone, it is hard not to give the amiable comedy/drama ""Quartet"" passing marks.  Actor Dustin Hoffman directed this genteel British chamber piece, and he serves a perfectly pleasant (if entirely predictable) story about aging, about music, and about reconnecting with what is important in your life before it's too late.  Although charming enough, the film is also relatively by-the-numbers.  The screenplay (by Ronald Harwood, based on his original play) follows an exact formula, hits all of the expected beats, and bows out quickly while it is still warming your heart.  While this makes for a pleasurable evening's entertainment, however, it never makes for a particularly memorable cinematic experience.  So lightweight, ultimately I found ""Quartet"" instantly forgettable.  Luckily for Hoffman and the audience, the formidable cast saves the day.  Headliners Maggie Smith, Tom Courtenay, Billy Connolly, Pauline Collins, and Michael Gambon are always worth a look individually.  Together, they make movie magic.The story is set in an esteemed retirement home for aging musicians.  The inhabitants (many played by real musical stars) are preparing for an annual recital.  This one is quite important, though, it must be spectacular to raise the funding necessary to keep the institution open.  We first meet Courtenay, Collins, and Connolly.  Billy Connolly has, perhaps, the showiest role as a dirty old man with little in the way of manners or filter.  Pauline Collins is dotty and forgetful, but charming and amusing as well.  They provide most of the overt laughs in ""Quartet,"" as does Gambon as the dictatorial director of the variety performance.  Tom Courtenay plays the level headed compatriot who holds them all together.  Enter Dame Maggie Smith.  A true diva, in both life and in this film, Smith becomes the centerpiece of the action.  Once married to Courtenay, they (with Collins and Connolly) once made a renowned operatic performance as the titular quartet.  Can Smith and Courtenay iron out their difficult past?  Might they all be coerced into reviving their magnificent performance?  And if so, can it save the home from financial ruin?I suspect you might already be able to guess the answers to these plot points.  But in many ways, this is more about the journey than its destination.  Frankly, I'd watch Maggie Smith in anything.  For my money, she is one of the greatest living actresses working today (The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie still ranks as one of my two favorite performances of all time).  Her scenes with Courtenay have a real delicacy and subtlety that connects us to the emotional heart of this rather slight tale.  They are the meat, everything else is the gravy.  But, as I mentioned, Connolly and Collins are both terrifically funny.  Nothing surprised me about ""Quartet,"" except perhaps for a rather abrupt ending, but I still enjoyed its modest charms.  Any time you get a handful of acting legends together, you can count me in!  And it's nice to see Smith back in a leading role!  About 3 1/2 stars, I'll round up for the actors.

If you are a baby boomer, or a musician, or both, as I am, or if you merely want to see a good movie with the marvelous Maggie Smith, this is for you.Set in a retirement home for retired and aging professional musicians, the ladies and gentlemen of the Thomas Beecham Home are getting ready for their annual fundraising gala honoring  the great composer Verdi. Three members of a renowned operatic quartet reside at the home, and the sparks begin to fly when Maggie Smith, as Jean Horton, the fourth and grand diva member of the quartet, arrives to live at Thomas Beecham. She had previously been married to one of the quartet, Reg, and their meeting is bittersweet. Faced with dwindling finances, Jean is forced to give up a spacious home to move to Thomas Beecham. It is not an easy pill to swallow. However, she is welcomed with an ovation from the other residents who remember and esteem her voice and musicianship. The quartet were renowned for their rendition of Verdi's Rigoletto, and the remaining members want to sing the quartet from Rigoletto for the gala. Jean, however, is broken in spirit and body, and not confident that her once golden voice will only embarrass her further.I will not divulge the remainder of the plot, suffice to say that this little gem of a movie, one of the best movies I have ever seen. This movie is heartwarming in its portrayal of our senior citizens, especially musicians, as the joints ache and bones creak, the reed players air support is not there, the singers' voices not as fluidly beautiful as in their heyday. But they are making do, as their life long love of music and their determination to present the show keeps them going.Especially heartwarming is that the members of Thomas Beecham all truly care for each other, and the ""youngsters"", the doctors and workers at the home, play second fiddle to this remarkable group, but one senses that the workers adore them. Billy Connolly is hysterically funny, a standout, as a member of the quartet who is the resident ""dirty old man"" and witty raconteur, keeping up the morale of the members of Thomas Beecham Home. The finale, as the members are set to perform, and come alive at the sound of the applause of the audience, will move you to tears.In all, a truly wonderful movie that casts a spell of warmth, humor and charm.

The residents are preparing for their annual gala, and this year the event is particularly important because, if it is not a success, the retirement home might be forced to close.Into this aged disorder comes a new resident (Smith), once an internationally renowned opera star, but now virtually broke and in need of a new hip.  She is also the former singing partner of Collins, Connolly and Courtenay, her former husband who has never forgiven her for her infidelity.Can past transgressions be forgiven?  If so, then perhaps the revered opera quartet can stage a special reunion for the gala and thereby save Beecham House.Ronald Harwood adapted his witty, quite touching stage play to the screen, and Hoffman has done a masterful job directing.

1619405,A1FG91CM8221X1,B00AZMFO6I,Miles D. Moore,"[26, 28]","Dustin Hoffman's ""Quartet,"" from Ronald Harwood's screenplay, takes the middle ground between ""Amour"" and ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel."" Like ""Amour,"" it depicts the infirmities of old age honestly. But like ""Marigold Hotel,"" it takes an upbeat view of its elderly characters, portraying their lives as triumphant rather than tragic.There isn't much to the story, which takes place in Beecham House, an elegant but financially troubled home for retired musicians. The residents are planning their annual gala on Oct. 10, Verdi's birthday, the revenues from which comprise a good portion of Beecham House's operating funds. Cedric (Michael Gambon), the imperious director of the annual gala, has commanded Reggie (Tom Courtenay), Wilf (Billy Connolly) and Cissy (Pauline Collins) to persuade Jean (Maggie Smith), a famous diva newly arrived at Beecham House, to sing at the gala. Jean, Reggie, Wilf and Cissy made a legendary recording of ""Rigoletto"" many years before, and their singing the quartet from ""Rigoletto"" at the gala would guarantee a big enough attendance to keep the home open indefinitely. However, Jean is painfully conscious that her voice is no longer what it was, and angrily rejects her friends' entreaties.There are further complications, the biggest is which is Jean and Reggie's painful romantic and marital history. Also, Wilf and Cissy are not well: Wilf has had a series of strokes, and Alzheimer's disease is tightening its grip on Cissy.Despite the sorrows, however, the overall mood of ""Quartet"" is genial and celebratory. Michael Powell once said that the only important things in life are love and art, and both are worth dying for. Hoffman and Harwood show us characters for whom art--specifically, the art of music--has been their entire way of life. Between that art and the love they bear for each other, they can go, if not gently, at least with equanimity into that good night.The final scenes of ""Quartet"" will leave you smiling through tears, but the final credits--which shows pictures of the various cast members in their prime--will have you bawling and applauding simultaneously.

And from the look and feel of this, his first attempt, he should have some success.  The film centers on a retirement home in pastoral England, established for aging musicians, classical musicians specifically.  Four residents in particular drive the story.Reggie (Tom Courtenay) and Wilf (Billy Connolly) and Cissy (Pauline Collins) are soon joined by a true opera star, Jean Horton (Maggie Smith) who was once part of their quartet and had a brief marriage to Reggie.  Years earlier with her career about to take off, she left the group and her husband and never looked back.  Reggie in particular isn't about to reconcile.  Michael Gambon also stars as Cedric who fancies himself as a producer/director and is putting together a live performance with the residents.  You know, to make money and save the home from possibly closing.Like this plot gimmick, ""Quartet"" doesn't break any new ground and is predictable to a fault.  At the same time the film is light hearted, funny and contains some spirited dialog, most of which belongs to Wilf.  There's also a nice scene when Reggie has a group of teens over for a lecture of sorts.  He gets into an exchange with a young man about the differences between opera and rap music.

This movie brings the story of Beecham House, a place in England that is ""Home for Retired Musicians"", but more accuratly very gifted musicians. All is well at Beecham House until the arrival of a new retiree, Jean Horton (played by Maggie Smith), once a very famous operetta singer. On top of that, also living at Beecham House is her ex-husband of many years ago, Reginald ""Reg"" Paget (played by Tom Courtenay). The annual gala (providing much needing funds for the continuing existance of Beecham House) is coming up, and the question is whether Jean and Reg, along with Wilf (played by Billy Connolly) and Cissy (played by Pauline Collins) will reunite as a quartet from many years ago to bring Verdi's Rigoletto.Several comments: noteworthy, this is the debut of Dustin Hoffman as a director. Why it has taken him this long to go beyond the camera I don't know, but better late than never (hey, he's a spring chicken at a mere mid-70s!). The acting performances are a delight pretty much from start to finish, even with Maggie Smith playing a mostly unlikable character (Jean is a ""prima donna"" for most of the movie, pining for her golden years of success and asking herself ""why do we have to get old?""). The movie is correctly billed as a comedy-drama. When it stays light-hearted, the movie plays great, but when it goes for the drama angle, the movie falters badly, and the end of the movie is utterly predictable. (But stay for the end credits! We get to see who among those at Beecham House in the movie were real-life musicians and what they did back then. One of the best surprises of the movie.)The proof is in the pudding: when I saw it in the theatre here in Cincinnati last weekend, the audience (of mostly seniors, I might add) lapped it up with chuckles and all-out laughter during the lighter moments of the movie (typical example: Reg reminisces to Jean 'I took 12 curtain calls' to which Jean immediately replies 'no you didn't, you took 9 and I took 12'). In the end, the movie was fine but it doesn't make a lasting impression.

Several of the movie haters speak of technical problems with the DVD and perhaps should not be counted. You should be aware that some folks have had technical issues. Others who speak against the movie seem to be upset that the language is not uniformly dignified. I'm not sure what to say to that. The language seemed very authentic. One soul felt that the movie was to geriatric. I'm guessing they missed all of the advertisements and did not pay attention to the picture on the cover. One negative person sniffed that this movie did not deal authentically with aging issues. This is not an issues movie; Quartet is if anything a slice of life -it is just happens that the slice of life under discussion is very close to the end-of-life.Director Dustin Hoffman has assembled one of those classic casts of British performers who are as at ease in supporting roles as in leading roles and know how to impart a quality depth to every performance. The philosophy on display here is that there are no small roles and small actors need not apply. While the performances and the script tends to favor classifying this is a comedy, the underlining theme is that these are people serious as death.Quartet takes place in a retirement home for British musicians. Overall these are plush quarters but  clearly assignments are made based on the reputation and status of the now retired artists. The story arc revolves around the long ago failed marriage between newly arriving Opera diva Jean Horton (Dame Maggie Smith) and equally diva -ish longer retired Reginald Pajet ( Tom Courtenay). Between them must be resolved first the issues that ended their marriage issues he has never gotten over. And second her loss of confidence in her singing ability so that she can participate in an upcoming fundraiser needed to keep the retirement home open. We can be almost confident how the story lines will be resolved but the brilliance in the writing is to keep us just enough unsure such that the dramatic tension holds through to the end.The real story line in quartet and the reason why I will not shrugged it off as a light comedy is in the nature of the personalities involved. The most immediate fact is that these are old people very aware that they are losing all of their individual capabilities due to their advancing age. These people are very aware that death awaits them impatiently. Secondly these people are all artists used to performing at very high levels. All have had to make sacrifices in the name of their artistic skills and now they are facing the fact that they must now sacrifice their standings as artists. There is an old expression ""nothing quite focuses the mind like the certainty that one is to die in the morning"". A premise of quartet is that to the degree that these minds can focus; they are aware that time is against them. Consequently decisions that have been delayed for years have to be attended to rapidly and in such a manner as to leave them neither compromised nor dissatisfied with their decisions. Ultimately these are people who choose to enjoy the time that is left to them.Besides a very well written story, a first class team of actors and one of those classic British Manor home film sets; Quartet is graced with the plethora of enjoyable small things. There is a 2 to 3 second image of a young girl in a white summer pinafore running across a green grass trailing a red shawl. It is visually breathtaking. There is a similar visual of Dame Maggie Smith in a simple, regal turquoise dress suit striding into the dining room which again speaks to what superb cameramen can achieve. Dir. Hoffman has filled the retirement home with real musicians. They are honored in the closing credits and they honor us with beautiful musical interludes throughout the movie.Something else Dustin Hoffman gets correct is that faces do not have to be conventionally beautiful to be beautiful. If there is one thing that American movies tend to render boring it's conventionally beautiful faces. From beginning to end quartet is filled with faces that are not normally allowed in close-ups and the movie is better for this decision.I am a huge fan of small-scale movies that do not require lots of flashing lights or loud noises or huge scale issues. Quartet is homage to art, to artistry and a movie that respects and therefore honors the elderly. This movie could have become maudlin or morose. It has more than a few cliches except that they are all used in creative and original ways. If you haven't figured it out yet I like this movie and I recommend it without hesitation.",5,Suddenly 5 stars are not enough.,1374537600,"07 23, 2013",2013,4884,"['What', 'will', 'follow', 'will',

That may be, but what makes this film wonderful is not the message but the cast. Maggie Smith is, as always, magnificent as the diva who no longer sings because she realizes that her best days are behind her but who listens to her own recordings (but denies doing so). Michael Gambon (the second Dumbledore in the Harry Potter films) shines as the director of the annual show to fund the home for retired musicians. Trevor Peacock (whom many will remember as the ""No, no, no, no, no, yes"" man fromThe Vicar of Dibleyis always a welcome treat.But the star of the show, at least in my eyes, is Billy Connolly, the forever flirtatious would-be lothario. In the commentary, Hoffman notes that Connolly was hesitant to take the role since he thought he would not be in the same class as the other cast members. Hoffman notes that Connolly underestimated his talents. I would add ""seriously"" before ""underestimated.""The plot itself is not exactly new, and there are few twists here. But the magnificent cast makes the plot almost secondary. Finally, one touching note is that over the closing credits, pictures of many of the cast members appear, both as they are in the film and as they were during their heyday.

I wish the whole movie could have made those simple emotional connections the same way the eloquent final gesture did. The premise of the film was uttered by a character who, at one point, said something like, ""Take part! Before you're the guest of honor at the crematorium."" And that really sums up what QUARTET was about--that the promise of life, happiness, and love do not end simply because we grow older and our physical beings fade.It's a lovely message. Yet the film seemed to be trying so hard to be serious, to be about big themes, that, at times, it was painfully slow. It could have used a bit more humor and a little less pretense. Its characters could have benefitted from being a bit more zany, so we would like and care about them more. Although I enjoyed the movie for the most part and would recommend it to others, I simply didn't think it had the spark of, say, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, another film with similar characters and themes.

My son is a huge fan of Opera as am I but even if you are not, you will be drawn into this film by the story and the brilliant acting of this fine cast.  Dustin Hoffman makes his directorial debut and I can only say I certainly hope he continues, because this was a sweet, funny film about older ones that manages to bring out the frustration of getting older without wallowing in bitterness.  You will be drawn in immediately to this story of Jean, the prima donna descending upon this lovely home for older artists and the havoc she creates with her presence.  I love the line, ""I had 12 curtain calls.""  To which Jean replies, ""No my dear, you had nine.  I had twelve."" They try to persuade her to be part of the quartet and sing a piece but she is such a perfectionist she is loath to sing and accept her voice as she has aged.  These lovely people manage finally to get her to agree to be part of their gala but it is quite an interesting journey.

1619460,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00AZMFO6I,RMurray847,"[0, 0]","QUARTET is set entirely at a ""Home for Retired Musicians"" in Britain.  It's a gorgeous old manor (think DOWNTON ABBEY) converted into a charitable home for classical musicians, opera singers, etc.  For not one moment does it seem plausible that this place would really exist...it's so beautiful and spacious and grand.  There are servants everywhere, even though the head of the establishment proclaims the recent ""staff reductions"" have really cut back on services.  And the place is full of lovely music all the time, because these retirees just can't stop performing and delighting each other.  It's a nice fantasy world, populated by several well-known (and well-worn) luminaries of the British screen.  I was willing to accept this fanciful setting, but this meant I was immediately set up to see the whole film as a trifle.And it is a trifle.  A gentle, amusing, twinkling and only modestly moving one.  The movie revolves around the annual gala held at the house, geared towards raising enough money to keep the place running one more year.  These old performers dust off their costumes (and their vocal chords), performing to a few wealthy individuals who apparently keep funding this place out of both charity and nostalgia.  Not for one minute is it believable that this one night event, in front of less than 100 people, could for year after year raise enough funding to keep this enormous place going.Anyway, into this friendly atmosphere comes new arrival Maggie Smith, a former MAJOR opera star.  She disrupts those around her, because she brings such a sour mood with her (as only Smith can do).  She meets up with the rest of her former quartet, Pauline Collins (ditsy, forgetful and forgiving), Billy Connelly (a sparkplug who steals all his scenes) and most importantly Tom Courtney, her former husband, who is still nursing some VERY deep resentments.  Courtney is a bundle of hurt, and if this group is to gel again (and headline the gala)...Smith and her ex must come to terms.Virtually none of the film is surprising.  You can predict so much of what will happen that it's as though you've seen it before.  In such a case, the film relies heavily on the charms of its stars.  And they do come through.  Connelly, as I said, is terrific.  He flirts continuously with EVERY woman he sees and is just generally the clown of the film, in the best way.  Courtney is tight and reserved and proper.  His performance is a bit one-note...but he's written that way a bit.  Collins is fun and zany.  Michael Gambon makes a puzzling turn as the director of the gala...a thoroughly disagreeable man who dresses just a bit like Dumbledore.  Did Gambon have to bring his old costumes to the filming?Smith, of course, is the main reason to see the movie, and she does a fine job.  She is never less than interesting.  But this role is nearly as fun as what she's done lately in DOWNTON or even in BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL.  She is sad and moody rather than acerbic and funny.  It makes sense that her character would be this way, considering how far she has fallen...but it's not as much fun.  Thus, Smith feels reigned in from the zing we have lately grown accustomed to from her.QUARTET is a perfectly pleasant movie and worth a look, particularly if you like those very gentle British comedies featuring these old stars.  But it travels no new ground and offers no revelations.  The music is GREAT though.",3,3.5 stars.

1619464,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00AZMFO6I,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","***1/2Neatly tucked away in the bucolic English countryside, Beecham House is a retirement home for aged singers and musicians who still perform for one another - and for the occasional outsider - on a regular basis. It is with the arrival of a newcomer - starchily played by the always-starchy Maggie Smith - that the tranquility of the place is suddenly threatened. For, you see, Jean Horton, a former opera diva, world-renowned for both her talent and her temper, was once briefly and unhappily married to one of the residents there, Reggie (Tom Courtenay), who had hoped to live out what is left of his life in peace, never having to see or interact with Jean ever again. Jean and Reggie once comprised one-half of a singing quartet that also included two other residents, Wilf (Billy Connelly) and Cissy (Pauline Collins), and the hope is that the four can be convinced to reunite for a performance that will bring in some much needed revenue for the home which otherwise might have to close its doors due to insufficient funds.Adapted by Ronald Harwood from his 1999 play, ""Quartet"" is a sweet and poignant comedy/drama that acknowledges the sadness and difficulties of growing old without unnecessarily dwelling on them. Long past their primes, these talented, life-affirming individuals know full well what the years have robbed them of, but they are also, to varying degrees, making the best of the time that is still left to them, though of the four, Jean is clearly having the greatest trouble adjusting to the realities of aging. The movie shows that it often takes as much courage for an artist to exercise his talents at the end of his life as it does at the beginning.In helming the project, Dustin Hoffman joins his colleagues Paul Newman (""Rachel, Rachel""), Robert Redford (""Ordinary People""), Warren Beatty (""Heaven Can Wait""), and Denzel Washington (""Antwone Fisher"") in proving, in his first time in the director`s chair, that he is as adept behind the camera as he is in front of it. ""Quartet"" is clearly an actors' picture, and Hoffman, respecting both the material and the talents he has on hand, wisely pulls back and lets these great seasoned performers do what it is they do best. The plotting may be a bit pat and predictable at times, but you can't go wrong with an acting quartet like the one here.",3,worth seeing for the performances alone,1372118400,"06 25, 2013",2013,2327,"['***1/2Neatly', 'tucked', 'away', 'bucolic', 'English', 'countryside', 'Beecham', 'House', 'retirement', 'home', 'aged', 'singers', 'musicians', 'who', 'still', 'perform', 'one', 'occasional', 'outsider', 'regular', 'basis', 'arrival', 'newcomer', 'starchily', 'played', 'always-starchy', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'tranquility', 'place', 'suddenly', 'threatened', 'see', 'Jean', 'Horton', 'former', 'opera', 'diva', 'world-renowned', 'talent', 'temper', 'was', 'once', 'briefly', 'unhappily', 'married', 'one', 'residents', 'there', 'Reggie', 'Tom', 'Courtenay', 'who', 'had', 'hoped', 'live', 'out', 'what', 'left', 'life', 'peace', 'never', 'having', 'see', 'interact', 'Jean', 'ever', 'again', 'Jean', 'Reggie', 'once', 'comprised', 'one-half', 'singing', 'quartet', 'also', 'included', 'two', 'other', 'residents', 'Wilf', 'Billy', 'Connelly', 'Cissy', 'Pauline', 'Collins', 'hope', 'four', 'can', 'be', 'convinced', 'reunite', 'performance', 'will', 'bring', 'much', 'needed', 'revenue', 'home', 'otherwise', 'might', 'have', 'close', 'doors', 'due', 'insufficient', 'funds.Adapted', 'Ronald', 'Harwood', '1999', 'play', 'Quartet', 'sweet', 'poignant', 'comedy/drama', 'sadness', 'difficulties', 'growing', 'old', 'unnecessarily', 'dwelling', 'Long', 'primes', 'talented', 'life-affirming', 'individuals', 'know', 'full', 'well', 'what', 'years', 'have', 'robbed', 'are', 'also', 'varying', 'degrees', 'making', 'best', 'time', 'still', 'left', 'four', 'Jean', 'clearly', 'having', 'greatest', 'trouble', 'adjusting', 'realities', 'aging', 'movie', 'often', 'as', 'much', 'courage', 'artist', 'exercise', 'talents', 'end', 'life', 'beginning.In', 'helming', 'project', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'colleagues', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Rachel', 'Rachel', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'Heaven', 'Can', 'Wait', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'proving', 'first', 'time', 'director', 's', 'chair', 'adept', 'camera', 'front', 'Quartet', 'clearly', 'actors', 'picture', 'Hoffman', 'respecting', 'material', 'talents', 'hand', 'wisely', 'back', 'great', 'seasoned', 'performers', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'best', 'plotting', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'pat', 'predictable', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'acting', 'quartet', 'one', 'here']",N/A

His main direction: don't act, just be yourself. The vicious verbal backstabbing and forgotten lines are hilarious and retained in this courageous independent film. Listen to his voice over commentary after you see the movie once.The UK quartet are visually intriguing, carrying on their faces lines carved by experience and reflection, with natural smiles lending character to comedic delivery (vs flattened expressionless ASIN:B00AYRIUOC Parental Guidance and ASIN:B003E7PZCO It's Complicated).The portrayal of aging with waxing and waning symptoms both physical and cognitive, is refreshing. The four principals were a quartet of opera singers who broke up after two of them married (for 9 hours) then divorced. 40 years later they find themselves all in the same assisted living facility for retired musicians and confront their past jealousies in an attempt to save the facility by performing at a fundraising gala.Seeing a romance between two 70 somethings, with a love that lasted through a lifelong separation is a joyous delight. This is a 5 star presentation for those at a phase of their lives when how you look to others doesn't matter as much as real friendship and keeping one another from wandering away.Other movies and books about mature caring:King George VI: The Man Behind the King's Speechdocumentary of a hero who sacrificed his life for his countrymen, and the grief of The Queen Mother, his wife, who asked that the movie not be released until after her death because the loss of the King was still so painful.

O. Scott's middling  New York Times review and its online reader responses, which seem to be either total disdain or absolute delight and nothing in between.It probably helps to have a lifelong love of classical music, especially opera, with just a smidgen of Gilbert & Sullivan & vaudeville mixed in.While, as expected, Maggie Smith, Pauline Collins, Tom Courtenay, Billy Connolly and Michael Gambon are superb in the leading roles,  the supporting player-musicians, who also inhabit the beautiful, scenic Beecham House, some of whom are familiar faces but most of whom I'd  never heard of, are a  joy to behold as well.  Please be sure to stay for the closing credits where you'll see headshots of each of them  as they are now and as they were in a key role from  their heydays.No one sums it up better than  Ann Hornaday in her rave review in the January 24, 2013 Washington Post: ""Smoothly navigating the perilous line between insufferably twee and heartbreakingly grim, ""Quartet"" is a subtle, sure-footed delight -- made all the more enjoyable by the fact that it was directed by a 75-year-old first-timer named Dustin Hoffman.  Judging from this debut, the kid's got a future.""RE THE DVD EXTRAS: There's a batch of short clips of the leading actors talking about the movie and what it was like to work with Hoffman.  But my fave is Hoffman's commentary track.  You get the impression of an old friend sitting alongside you with his feet up, filling you in on the story behind the creation of these scenes, how they found all those wonderful old musicians for the supporting roles, sharing anecdotes about the actors and production challenges, pointing out  how much of what's on screen was in the script and how much (quite a lot) was improvised. (Example: Pauline Collins's request--which was granted--that she adapt and play her character as being in the early stages of  dementia, modeled on her own real-life mother.) It's great fun to go back to the movie for another look with DH's  insights and anecdotes and backgrounders in mind.I'm thinking this DVD might make just the right double feature for ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.""",5,Will you love it?

It is a superb cast; many of those men and women actually lived that role in their daily life. Personally, Iwanted to be able to walk through space and time, and be a character in that movie.

The truth is... this movie does begin a bit slowly... much like the characters it depicts.  And that would not necessarily be a criticism--I love character-built films and books--except that while we are strolling our way through the exposition on this fabulous ensemble cast, the tone is just a tad on the dark side.  And it's not the dark comical sort of gallows humor such as we see in films like Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (suggested if you need a bit of a lift after this one); it truly is an ""old age isn't for sissies"" themed piece, with very little comic relief to make us believe there will be hand-holding and tenderness throughout.Still... I didn't think I could love Dame Maggie Smith any more than I already do from her impressive career, but I found even deeper levels of her talent here.  In fact, there are splendid performances here by Pauline Collins (pitch perfect in her role, really), Tom Courtenay, and I would be remiss if I didn't confess I've never been able to help being a little in love with Billy Connolly, no matter what role he plays.  Michael Gambon is great as well, although his role doesn't ask much of him.I think if one understands that this film was first a stage play, one has a better appreciation of what Dustin Hoffman was trying to do.  Moving a drama from a live theater audience to a movie-going public audience is nearly always problematic.  For some reason we expect to find cynicism in the theater but happily-ever-after in the movies.  Or at least, I do.All things considered, this film touches on several issues dear to my heart, not the least of which is recognition of what our seniors have to offer if we will but listen.  My favorite part had to be when ""Reg"" explains to a young man the difference between opera and rap.

In fact there are many memorable Operatic and instrumental performances including a 76 year old lady who incredibly sings like a 26 year old. I'm really not into Opera music but this deeply heartfelt movie was a very pleasant exception.

So it's always advisable to sort reviews by date and note which version is being reviewed. THIS review is of the DVD.I saw this wonderful film last year at the Philadelphia Film Festival and immediately told all my friends to catch it when it hit national release. As you can see by the reviews posted here already, those who have seen and loved it have sometimes seen it more than once. If you have only seen it once, I urge you to get the DVD when it is released later this month. Not only will you get to savor some of the wonderful dialogue and acting again but the bonuses will make your experience even better.Both the DVD and BD contain two ""bonuses"". The first is a series of ""making of"" featurettes covering the directing, casting, music and script. There are seven of them that can be played separately or as ""all"". They are really short and total just 14 minutes, but worth watching. The other bonus is the full length commentary track by Director Dustin Hoffman.  I don't always have time to listen to these but, in this case, I'm glad I did. It is probably one of the best commentaries I've heard. Hoffman provides insight into many scenes and lets us know the many times the ""dream cast"" of actors for this ""independent"" film (thankfully picked up by the Weinstein brothers) are adlibbing their lines. There is just enough dialogue included to blend in with Hoffman's discussions to job your memory but not fill it with too much. The 98 minutes went by quickly and I felt I knew the film better after hearing Hoffman explain the casting and the need to some scenes.I'll leave it to others to tell you about the plot - though I think you'll do best to discover it yourself.With the great lines - and the great music - all filmed ""live""!;no lipsynching here -by real musicians and singers - this is a film you can watch again and find something new each time.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,"Review of DVD version - Even if you saw the film in the theater, you'll want the DVD or BD",1370649600,"06 8, 2013",2013,2095,"['Note', 'Amazon', 'ALL', 'reviews', 'film', 'together', 'be', 'theatrical', 'version', 'streaming', 'version', 'DVD', 'BD', 'always', 'advisable', 'sort', 'reviews', 'date', 'note', 'version', 'being', 'reviewed', 'THIS', 'review', 'DVD.I', 'saw', 'wonderful', 'film', 'last', 'year', 'Philadelphia', 'Film', 'Festival', 'immediately', 'told', 'friends', 'catch', 'when', 'hit', 'national', 'release', 'can', 'see', 'reviews', 'posted', 'here', 'already', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'loved', 'have', 'sometimes', 'seen', 'more', 'once', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'once', 'urge', 'get', 'DVD', 'when', 'released', 'later', 'month', 'Not', 'only', 'will', 'get', 'savor', 'wonderful', 'dialogue', 'acting', 'again', 'bonuses', 'will', 'make', 'experience', 'even', 'better.Both', 'DVD', 'BD', 'contain', 'two', 'bonuses', 'first', 'series', 'making', 'featurettes', 'covering', 'directing', 'casting', 'music', 'script', 'are', 'seven', 'can', 'be', 'played', 'separately', 'are', 'really', 'short', 'total', 'just', '14', 'minutes', 'worth', 'watching', 'other', 'bonus', 'full', 'length', 'commentary', 'track', 'Director', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'have', 'time', 'listen', 'case', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'commentaries', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Hoffman', 'insight', 'many', 'scenes', 'know', 'many', 'times', 'dream', 'cast', 'actors', 'independent', 'film', 'thankfully', 'picked', 'up', 'Weinstein', 'brothers', 'are', 'adlibbing', 'lines', 'just', 'enough', 'dialogue', 'included', 'blend', 'Hoffman', 'discussions', 'job', 'memory', 'not', 'fill', 'too', 'much', '98', 'minutes', 'went', 'quickly', 'felt', 'knew', 'film', 'better', 'hearing', 'Hoffman', 'explain', 'casting', 'need', 'scenes.I', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'others', 'tell', 'plot', 'think', ""'ll"", 'do', 'best', 'discover', 'great', 'lines', 'great', 'music', 'filmed', 'live', 'lipsynching', 'here', '-by', 'real', 'musicians', 'singers', 'film', 'can', 'watch', 'again', 'find', 'something', 'new', 'time.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A

Everyone is a former star (or likes to think they were). At the start of the movie the residents are involved in practicing for their annual benefit performance - especially important this year as they hope to raise enough money to keep it running for the rest of the year.  The frenzy is racheted up a notch when a new resident arrives, played by Maggie Smith.

This year, however, tickets are not selling well, when a new guest Jean Horton (Maggie Smith) arrives. This should be perfect, for she once collaborated with Reg (Tom Courtenay), Wilf (Billy Connolly), and Cissy (Pauline Collins), to perform Verdi's ""Rigoletto,"" but Jean - Reg's former wife - refuses to sing.The screenplay is written by Ronald Harwood, based on his own play. The veteran writer is known as screenwriter for such wonderful works as ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,"" ""The Pianist,"" and ""The Dresser"" (the last starring Tom Courtenay). With a rather conventional storyline, ""Quartet"" may not be among his best, but it is still enjoyable with likeable characters.Jumayn Hunter (""Attack the Block"") briefly appears as an avid hip-hop fan, engaging in a debate with Reg teaching opera over similarities of two music styles.

Perhaps my expectations were too high going into another British movie, but unfortunately it didn't move me as much as I had hoped. In fact, I fast-forwarded the ending just to get through it.  I so hate giving a two-star review to great artists.  But just because they are, it doesn't make the work itself a great picture.It's a story about a retirement home where aging musicians go to live out the remainder of their lives.  Many of them know each other from the early days when they were at the highlight of their careers.  They have now congregated in one place to continue dabbling in the art of music while they wait for the undertaker to take them away in a body bag.Maggie Smith plays Jean Horton, a once famous and highly sought after opera singer who is now old, broke, and alone.  (Of course they say she's broke, but I'm not sure how she affords the swanky retirement home.)  Like most elderly, her baggage upon arrival is filled with bitterness over life. To make matters worse, she discovers that her ex-husband is living out his days at the retirement home as well.  He's not much better when it comes to forgiveness for Jean's early days of adultery, so most of the movie he has a chip on his shoulder along with the air of being a former star himself.The storyline is weak, superficial, and frankly uninteresting.  I will say this, that it would be a great place to retire! The movie is set in an converted English manor, with gorgeous countryside, comfortable and beautiful interior, kind staff, and an eclectic mix of eccentric elderly. You can sing your days away, rumba to music, croquet to your heart's content, and walk the grounds with a dirty old man, if you'd like. However, the story, at least for me, started with a great premise, but moved at a snail's pace.If the movie accomplishes anything, it does give a poignant view of aging and how one's youth and glory fades. We all know it's coming; perhaps we just don't wish to acknowledge it.Excuse me, while I search the Internet to find a retirement home in the UK that fits the description for retired authors.  I would love to pack my bags and take my own bitterness over life to a swanky retirement home in the English countryside to live out my days.

My wife and I are old (65 and 68) so we could identify with the characters, even though they were retired opera singers and orchestra members. We saw it via our cable company's ""on demand HD"" movie rental option. (We just purchased our first flat-screen set a couple of weeks ago.) The acting is fine, the music is glorious. My father-in-law, age 91, a WW II vet who earned a Silver Star for saving the life of a fellow sailor on a burning ship, just moved in to a fancy retirement palace much like the one depicted here. So we had plenty to recognize and with which to identify.

The principals are all great actors and much has already been said about them in other reviews, all praise deserved. Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, and Tom Courtenay - we have come to expect amazing performances from them. But the best of them as far as I am concerned was Billy Connolly. His humor and wit not only keep the movie light and enjoyable, but cheer and comfort those around him. He is a true spirit of growing old gracefully, a true morality tale of choosing to enjoy life rather than let it get you down. Another plus in this movie is that most of the musicians in this ensemble are real musicians who have had music careers in their lifetime and are still amazing. The music is fantastic and mixes up all sorts of styles with even an appreciation of 'rap'. Another actor who must be mentioned is Pauline Collins and her portrayal of a woman who is 'losing it'. Here was another example of growing old with dignity and grace, loved by everyone around her. I am sorry that Dustin Hoffman has waited so long to direct a film. He is certainly gifted as a director and I hope he will consider other projects.

To have it happen in a retirement center for has-been musicians was the icing on the cake.  I told my friends watching it, ""If I get like Maggie Smith's character in my old age, just put me out of my misery as quickly as possible.""  In the end, of course, Maggie Smith comes through.

While I enjoy the occasional drama/comedy of manners, this movie's plot of the reunion of four aging opera singers in a home is not what I usually buy or rent for myself.This movie greatly exceeded my expectations. It was warm, humorous, and even romantic. Even my mother-in-law, who doesn't like opera, really enjoyed it.Adapted from a stage play there are few alterations to the movie format leaving some puzzles: time seems to move with varying degrees, there are no apparent elevators in the retirement home as the residents seem to use the stairs.  The staff is small and relatives of the residents are not seen.  Beecham House is in danger of going under, but this point is quickly forgotten with more attention given to the characters than the plot. You will want to keep your finger on the volume control of your remote while watching this, as parts are hard to hear/understand--or turn on the subtitles.If you are not a fan of opera, you can still overlook it for an enjoyable movie.  The terrific cast and first-time direction by Dustin Hoffman(at age 75) are worth seeing. In sum, this is a great for the adult members of your family. The movie is funny and well done.  (There is nothing objectionable for kids outside of a little strong language, but they'd be bored.)
