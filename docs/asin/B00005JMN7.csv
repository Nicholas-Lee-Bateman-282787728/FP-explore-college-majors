It captured the affection of growing up so precisely and it never shied away from the truth behind reality. Neal Marlens and Carol Black weren't just geniuses, but earnest writers who knew what it felt like to grow up during a time when the world was under significant change. ""The Wonder Years"" holds a piece of truth with any generation growing up with the show.

When Wonder Years did arrive I could relate to the show very well, reason I beleive it was close to home with the story lines. Back in the 1960's our fathers were more distant, the concerns back than was being a good provider for the family, and working out the problems around the discipline required for the children.  Feelings towards the wife was alittle more secret and kept away from the children alot more than now, and yes the children knew just what was expected from them.  During the show's running it covers the Vietnam War, they were real bad heart breaking times, loosing so many of our wonderful loyal men, who fought in this cruel war, the show covers this, and you really do feel the loss, in this show.  The mums in the 60's were busy keeping the husband happy and children, a hard role to have to keep a balance on, again this show picks up on that very well.

The-now adult Kevin Arnold (whom I am supposed to believe is roughly around the same age as my parents) voices the introduction to each episode.  The series is a flashback to his childhood.Yet, because the lessons learned are timeless---this tequnique is not sanctimonious or preachy.Viewers cannot help but like Kevin's boy-next-door charm and the enduring friendship of Winnie (Danica McKellar) and Paul Pffeifer (Josh Saviano). Even before Kevin experiences generational tragedies (Vietnam...etc) he deals with a horrible older brother named Wayne (Jason Hervey) who will not stop pestering him and a dad (Dan Lauria) who rules the roost.Kevin also has an older hippie sister named Karen (whose bohemian ways befuddle the suburbanite and conservative Arnolds) but her character is underdeveloped. Because the theme of this series is that some things really are timeless, the conflict is primarily on Kevin and Wayne.

Shortly after it began to air regularly I began to tell people that this was the best written, best acted, and overall best TV show ever produced in America (Kung Fu, Brooklyn Bridge, and even M*A*S*H notwithstanding).  I got few arguments.  Being a student of film and music, I believe my statement will stand scrutiny.  What Black & Marlens, and later Bob Brush,  produced were five years of short films, some of which were two or three part-ers, each of which could stand alone.  I encourage those in charge to work diligently at securing the music copy rights (I know that foreign broadcasts of the show featured alternate music), because as a musician I KNEW why certain pieces were put in where.  A classic example is Kevin being dumped at the museum by Winnie, then sitting alone as the rain trickles down the bus window, and the buses pulling apart as the Beach Boys' Carl Wilson sings ""God Only Knows"".  It was killer.  ""Why Don't You Stay"" by Bob Seger, as we see Kevin longing for the battered Winnie after a car accident, is another example.  So get the music rights, and PLEASE prepare this series for release.  I would recommend not just individual season boxes, but also a full series box.  And if you can include the Biography special from 2003, many of the show's fans will find completion in their TV-watching lives (and growing-up years).  You can also hire me as a production consultant, if you want....",5,"MESSAGE TO THE POWERS THAT BE, REGARDING A DVD RELEASE OF THIS SERIES",1180569600,"05 31, 2007",2007,1567,"['caught', 'first', 'second', 'show', 'series', 'accident', 'back', 'early', '1988', 'was', 'dedicated', 'viewer', 'whole', 'series', 'then', 'Shortly', 'began', 'air', 'regularly', 'began', 'tell', 'people', 'was', 'best', 'written', 'best', 'acted', 'overall', 'best', 'TV', 'show', 'ever', 'produced', 'America', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Brooklyn', 'Bridge', 'even', 'M*A*S*H', 'notwithstanding', 'got', 'few', 'arguments', 'Being', 'student', 'film', 'music', 'believe', 'statement', 'will', 'stand', 'scrutiny', 'What', 'Black', 'Marlens', 'later', 'Bob', 'Brush', 'produced', 'were', 'five', 'years', 'short', 'films', 'were', 'two', 'three', 'part-ers', 'could', 'stand', 'alone', 'encourage', 'charge', 'work', 'diligently', 'securing', 'music', 'copy', 'rights', 'know', 'foreign', 'broadcasts', 'show', 'featured', 'alternate', 'music', 'musician', 'KNEW', 'why', 'certain', 'pieces', 'were', 'put', 'where', 'classic', 'example', 'Kevin', 'being', 'dumped', 'museum', 'Winnie', 'then', 'sitting', 'alone', 'rain', 'down', 'bus', 'window', 'buses', 'pulling', 'apart', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'Carl', 'Wilson', 'God', 'Only', 'was', 'killer', 'Why', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Stay', 'Bob', 'Seger', 'see', 'Kevin', 'longing', 'battered', 'Winnie', 'car', 'accident', 'example', 'So', 'get', 'music', 'rights', 'PLEASE', 'prepare', 'series', 'release', 'would', 'recommend', 'not', 'just', 'individual', 'season', 'boxes', 'also', 'full', 'series', 'box', 'can', 'include', 'Biography', 'special', '2003', 'many', 'show', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'completion', 'TV-watching', 'lives', 'growing-up', 'years', 'can', 'also', 'hire', 'production', 'consultant', 'want']",The Wonder Years: The Complete Series Set

620536,AP3B615GM191G,B00005JMN7,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","In 1988, &#34;The Wonder Years&#34; hit the airwaves as a mid-season replacement show.  In the span of just six short episodes, however, it captured the imagination of baby boomers everywhere.Basically, &#34;The Wonder Years&#34; is the story of Kevin Arnold (Fred Savage), a kid starting junior high in 1968.  The show touches on all aspects of his life, including best friend Paul Pffiefer (Josh Saviano), crush Winnie Cooper (Danica McKellar), father Jack (Dan Lauria), mother Norma (Alley Mills), and siblings Karen (Olivia d'Abo) & Wayne (Jason Hervey).The primary reason this show became so popular is because it played to the nostalgia of the baby boomers.  For example, my father (whose own junior/high school experiences were set exactly in the same time frame as Kevin) considers this to be one of the greatest shows of all-time.  The show creators were really able to capture the essence of 1960s life from a child's perspective.  It was also the first show to have a narrator voicing the inner thoughts of the main character.  The show was initially mocked for this, but without that innovative strategy &#34;The Wonder Years&#34; would have been a complete failure (as it is the &#34;narrator thoughts&#34;) that provide the bulk of the really funny humor.At the same time, the show (though slowed by legal wrangling over music rights, thus delaying any sort of release for decades) manages to remain relevant because it also portrays the junior high and high school experience.  I first was introduced to the show when I was roughly 10-12 years old, and I could instantly relate to the characters even though the show was based in the 1960s.  Again, the writers/creators expertly captured what life is like at that confusing, yet wonderful age.In this first season, specifically, the groundwork is laid for what is to come.  All the main characters are introduced (if somewhat briefly), and the viewer gets a feel for the show's unique blend of comedy and drama (much like &#34;All In The Family&#34;, but just with a different sort of vibe).  Besides maybe &#34;The Phone Call&#34;, I can't really say that any of the other five episodes in this super-short &#34;season&#34; are incredible (granted, I've seen most of the episodes already so I know what is to come), thus the four-stars instead of five.For an interesting parallel to today's television, I consider &#34;The Wonder Years&#34; to be something like a &#34;Mad Men&#34;.  Both shows are set in the 1960s are are incredibly detailed and careful about portraying those times accurately.  The only different is that whereas &#34;Mad Men&#34; focuses on adults in business (and then branches out into family/relationships), &#34;Wonder Years&#34; begins with the family/school and branches out from their.Overall, this six-episode introduction to &#34;The Wonder Years&#34; will leave you wanting more.",4,The Start Of Something Special,1391817600,"02 8, 2014",2014,2876,"['1988', '34', 'Wonder', 'Years', '34', 'hit', 'airwaves', 'mid-season', 'replacement', 'show', 'span', 'just', 'six', 'short', 'episodes', 'however', 'captured', 'imagination', 'baby', 'boomers', 'everywhere.Basically', '34', 'Wonder', 'Years', '34', 'story', 'Kevin', 'Arnold', 'Fred', 'Savage', 'kid', 'starting', 'junior', 'high', '1968', 'show', 'aspects', 'life', 'including', 'best', 'friend', 'Paul', 'Pffiefer', 'Josh', 'Saviano', 'crush', 'Winnie', 'Cooper', 'Danica', 'McKellar', 'father', 'Jack', 'Dan', 'Lauria', 'mother', 'Norma', 'Alley', 'Mills', 'siblings', 'Karen', 'Olivia', ""d'Abo"", 'Wayne', 'Jason', 'Hervey', '.The', 'primary', 'reason', 'show', 'became', 'so', 'popular', 'played', 'nostalgia', 'baby', 'boomers', 'example', 'father', 'own', 'junior/high', 'school', 'experiences', 'were', 'set', 'exactly', 'same', 'time', 'frame', 'Kevin', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'shows', 'all-time', 'show', 'creators', 'were', 'really', 'able', 'capture', 'essence', '1960s', 'life', 'child', 'perspective', 'was', 'also', 'first', 'show', 'have', 'narrator', 'voicing', 'inner', 'thoughts', 'main', 'character', 'show', 'was', 'initially', 'mocked', 'innovative', 'strategy', '34', 'Wonder', 'Years', '34', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'complete', 'failure', '34', 'narrator', 'thoughts', '34', 'provide', 'bulk', 'really', 'funny', 'humor.At', 'same', 'time', 'show', 'slowed', 'legal', 'wrangling', 'music', 'rights', 'thus', 'delaying', 'sort', 'release', 'decades', 'remain', 'relevant', 'also', 'junior', 'high', 'high', 'school', 'experience', 'first', 'was', 'introduced', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'roughly', '10-12', 'years', 'old', 'could', 'instantly', 'relate', 'characters', 'even', 'show', 'was', 'based', '1960s', 'Again', 'writers/creators', 'expertly', 'captured', 'what', 'life', 'confusing', 'yet', 'wonderful', 'age.In', 'first', 'season', 'specifically', 'groundwork', 'laid', 'what', 'come', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'somewhat', 'briefly', 'viewer', 'feel', 'show', 'unique', 'blend', 'comedy', 'drama', 'much', '34', 'Family', '34', 'just', 'different', 'sort', 'vibe', 'maybe', '34', 'Phone', 'Call', '34', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'other', 'five', 'episodes', 'super-short', '34', 'season', '34', 'are', 'incredible', 'granted', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'episodes', 'already', 'so', 'know', 'what', 'come', 'thus', 'four-stars', 'instead', 'five.For', 'interesting', 'parallel', 'today', 'television', 'consider', '34', 'Wonder', 'Years', '34', 'be', 'something', '34', 'Mad', 'Men', '34', 'shows', 'are', 'set', '1960s', 'are', 'are', 'incredibly', 'detailed', 'careful', 'portraying', 'times', 'accurately', 'only', 'different', 'whereas', '34', 'Mad', 'Men', '34', 'focuses', 'adults', 'business', 'then', 'branches', 'out', 'family/relationships', '34', 'Wonder', 'Years', '34', 'begins', 'family/school', 'branches', 'out', 'their.Overall', 'six-episode', 'introduction', '34', 'Wonder', 'Years', '34', 'will', 'leave', 'wanting', 'more']",The Wonder Years: The Complete Series Set

Please!""",5,"One of the best shows on television, ever!",1178150400,"05 3, 2007",2007,873,"['was', 'teenager', 'when', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'aired', 'TV', 'remember', 'watching', 'episode', 'family', 'discussing', 'situations', 'were', 'so', 'familiar', 'reflective', 'real', 'life', 'have', 'loved', 'show', 'then', 'opinion', 'one', 'rare', 'shows', 'withstood', 'test', 'time', 'characters', 'Kevin', 'Paul', 'Winnie', 'Cooper', 'Arnold', 'family', 'were', 'reminders', 'parts', 'ourselves', 'situations', 'were', 'so', 'true', 'real-life', 'always', 'element', 'humor', 'poignancy', 'ran', 'episode', 'made', 'more', 'unforgettable', 'great', 'music', 'evocative', 'era', 'was', 'set', 'too', 'am', 'hopeful', 'excellent', 'family', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'available', 'entirety', 'DVD', 'ION', 'channel', 'showing', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'order', ""'m"", 'sure', 'speak', 'fans', 'when', 'say', 'Bring', 'out', 'DVD', 'soon', 'Please']",The Wonder Years: The Complete Series Set
