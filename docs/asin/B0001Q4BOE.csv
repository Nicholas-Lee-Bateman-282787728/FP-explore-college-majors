Guess which decision he makes.It does has some funny moments, but they are mixed in with several plot lines that don't really relate to the movie - a love-hate romance with two of the younger barbers, Cedric the Entertainer reminiscing about his past (We never did find out why his girl left) and the white guy barber's pompous attitude.Overall, I finished watching that movie and thought.

It may not have had the originality that the first one had, but it took the characters from the original and expanded their roles and history. The characters were believable and none went over to the realm of the stock, stereotypical black character seen in most black-themed films.Again, the stand out performances are made by Cedric the Entertainer's Eddie and Ice Cube's Calvin. Where Eddie is the comedy and conscience of the film, Cube's Calvin is the soul and center of the film. It is hard to believe that this is the same person who started the &quot;gangsta rap&quot; trend of the early 90's and also starred mostly in roles as a gang-member. Cube has shown that he can take a serious role and make it his own.The end of the film came too soon. I wanted to see more about these characters and see how the rest of their lives unfolded.

This one showcases Calvin's personal life and delves into his past.  And his fathers relationship with Cedric's role.  One such thing is you find out how Cedric got hired and you find out he had a love!  You also see how competition gets in the way of the Barbershop.  This show introduced us to Queen and her upcoming role in The Beautyshop.Over-all this movie is good because it held its ground compared to most sequels.

812668,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B0001Q4BOE,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[3, 4]","""Barbershop 2"" is a good movie, but no it does not live up to the standard set by ""Barbershop."" Unfortunately, the film is filled with problems.  First and foremost we realize that these characters are really only interesting within the context of the first film. This film gets too ambitious and lets us see the characters as they travel through time and the city.  I understand that it is to underline the point of this film (and the first one) that small business has more heart and soul than corporations (and I agree...duh). However, Cedric the Entertainer's love life and radicalism of 30 years ago didn't really strike a chord with me.  Also, they take a cheap shot at uptight white men that would've been funny if not completely unoriginal.  But with those problems out of the way, the only thing left to talk about is the good stuff. Here we have a film that resists temptation on more than one occasion.  To the surprise of me an exotic looking fish tank is left unscathed and the ending is not sappy for the sake of being sappy.  I also like the performances by Eve and Cedric the Entertainer.  The scene in which Cedric goes at it with Queen Latifah at a picnic is probably my personal favorite.  I also enjoy movies that deal with topical conversations.  All these are the reasons why I am recommending this film.  Of course while bashing the corporations this film played at multiplexes across the country, ironic? I would say it falls victim to the ""It's a Wonderful Life"" syndrome where people think that if they watch films like this then they are magically George Bailey and not Mr. Potter.  I also wish that they could have hit a little harder on the idea of why Nappy Cuts needed all of the flashy gimmicks. I would say that corporations use things like basketball courts inside a hair cut place because they know that they can never emulate the sincere community feeling that you get by going to a small business. And they also know that when it comes down to money or community the people will always pick money. Oh well. This film is pretty much a commercial version of the HBO film ""Everyday People.""

Sure the plot is just about the same as the first, but the movie still entertains and the cast is even better since we have a few new characters, suchas Queen Latifah who plays Gina, the owner of another barbershopnear Calvin's.Ice Cube returns as Calvin Palmer, the owner of a very popular barbershop on the Chicago Southside.  The entire cast does return, and offers something a little new to the film, surely Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer) for in this film he rambles about the Kobe Bryant trial, R. Kelly and Michael Jackson as well as a few others.  Eve returns as Teri, Sean Patrick Thomas, Michael Ealy, Troy Garity and more.  I should also point out that this installment is directed by a different director, Kevin Rodney Sullivan who made his debut with this film and he keeps the franchise going more than well.Barbershop 2: Back In Business is rated PG-13 for Language, Sexual Material and Brief Drug References.  The language is a bit bawdy and rough, there's also sexual innuendo nothing explicit though.

812672,A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR,B0001Q4BOE,David E. Levine,"[1, 2]","This was an enjoyable comedy, largely due to Cedric the Entertainer protraying Eddie, a barber who has been with the shop for generations, originally, having worked for the owner's father. Ice Cube plays ther likable but intense barbershop owner Calvin Palmer. After saving the barbershop in the original movie, there is a new crisis in this sequel as a super fancy mega hairstyling shop which is part of a chain is opening across the street. Of course, there are the usual villains, as local politicians on the take promote the new shop. The result is predictable; the shop was saved in the original and, I don't think I'm giving anything away by revealing that, ultimately, the villains are exposed and it survives here too. In short, the plot is entertaining but pretty much set to a formula.What makes the movie is the interplay and conversation among the employees of the shop and the regulars who hang out there. The plot is really secondary. The character development is surprisingly good and the viewer almost feels at home, as though we could go through the screen and become part of the interplay. However, in this aspect, the original was even better. Eddie actually created quite a stir by making irreverent comments about both Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King in that movie. That type of interplay lent realism to the movie since, in barbershops, there are always opinionated characters saying outrageous things.

The first Barbershop film really is a breakthrough to me when it comes to actually be interested in black cinema.  Most black films I've seen in my time before that movie came are either depressing(Losing Isaiah) or dull for the developing mind(How High).  Barbershop didn't make me feel either one of these emotions; that movie has made my day a good one, because it's not only hilarious, but it show deep values of appreciating running a barber shop business and the hard work and effort the place has been put on for years without change its true nature, plus the thoughtfulness on the characters that work in it.  I admit there were past black movies that were better than that, but still, Barbershop holds a special place in my heart.  It didn't really surprise me to see that, due to popular demand, that a sequel was in the mix, Barbershop 2: Back in Business, and not surprising to me after watching it, it's more of the same thing.After the over-the-top, high budget intro with the people getting their haircuts while showing slides of revolutionary and current well-known black people in a low opacity at quickspeed interpreting the development of black history from then 'till now, the story begins with a flashback of Cedric's character, in the 1967 era, going to the barbershop for the first time and how he got involved with the shop, though I wouldn't use the word ""involved"" from Cedric's situation. From then on, it showed the present-day barber shop running well until a successful conglomerate moves into the neighborhood to construct a high-budget barber shop for friendly competition; in other words, taking down a small shop.  As he is one of many power-hungry businessmen trying to buy run-down stores and nip-and-tuck the inner-beauty of the neighborhood in Chicago as a means of some land reconstruction law, the barber shop crew and the community experienced some ups-and-downs in these current events, but hey, it's all going to be work out in the end.The story's plot construction is like connect-the-dots, but that's alright, 'cause the movie is laugh-out-loud funny.  All of the cast from the first movie are back in this sequel, including some newcomers, Queen Latifah and Kenan Thompson(Ah yeah! The original ""All That"" star is on Barbershop 2. He-hey!) Some of these original characters also have went through a life-changing experience:  Ice Cube's character, Calvin, is more serious in keeping his business alive and supporting his family; Eve's character, Terri, tries  to get away from her typical [expletive deleted] self, and reach into her ""peaceful, spiritual"" self towards people she abhors; and Michael Ealy's Ricky Nash is less of a criminal and more laid-back, but was actually trying to do something important to his life that nobody wants to know.  Even if the characters changed themselves of their expressive appearances, it's good to know that they're the same people I've laughed at from the first film.  What got me curiously interested about this movie is Cedric's character and his back stories.  His character, Eddie, is more focused and explanatory in this sequel, and that left me with mixed feelings.  The b-stories do explain how he got to the barber shop, how he sees the shop as his second home, and how he respect Calvin's father as a barber enough to turn his life around.  However, thought touching, these b-stories left a little inconclusive.  The same goes for the b-story on Eddie's relationship with some girl he seen on a subway, which I find also rushed and lenient.These back stories point out on the movie's downsides: the big one, lack of artistic direction.  I figured this sequel was directed by a different person, but the movie could've done so much with ideas that could've made this made this movie very different from the original.  The first movie was fresh in interventions on discussive issues on black historians and celebrities, and people act how they feel without anything extreme; the second film was more along of the same interventions and I don't see how this was heading to a different route, so it felt more refurbushed than something fresh out of the box.  On a personal note, I was beefed with Queen Latifah's character as a spunky, hair-stylish next door.  She appear in this movie as a special appearance, but there was a lot of scenes on her, but yet, nothing deep came from her character.  More of her character without focus on the depth makes her a liability, and that sets me off.I don't want to open up and say this is superior to the original, 'cause honestly, it ain't.  It isn't as thought-provoking as the first film, but in all respects, the things that I like from the first Barbershop came in this sequel, but more refined with a few surprises(Come on, now!  Kenan Thompson is in this movie!).  Barbershop 2 is still a worthy sequel, and I'm lovin' this.",4,Da Barbershop is Back in Business.,1076457600,"02 11, 2004",2004,4927,"['business', 'running', 'smoothly', 'routine', 'schedule',

Don't get me wrong, I like the first one better now, but ""Barbershop 2"" is one of those rare sequals where it's better than the first, and it's a brand new idea with fresh new humor. ""Barbershop 2"" is a movie about change. Throughout the entire movie, everything that happens around the barbershop is changing. The neighborhood, some of the buildings and stores, and people's minds. In the first film, everybody in the stores around the shop are standing firm and not worrying about being taken over by money. In the second film, everybody wants to change because of money, except for the barbershop. There is a huge difference in characters from the first movie to the second.In ""Barbershop 2"" Calvin Palmer is a new father, who owns his fathers barbershop from 1958. The many people who work in his shop begin with Issac, the only white barber, who claims that he is the best in the shop. There is the african Dinka, who has a crush on the only women barber Terri. But Terri seems to have feelings with ex-thug Ricky, who is trying to get his life back on track, but also shares the same feelings for Terri. Calvin's cousin Kernard is coming right out of barber school, and Calvin gives him a job in the shop. The former barber of the shop Jimmy, is working for politician Alderman Brown, but he is still a regular customer. Calvin's ex-girlfriend Gina owns the beauty shop next door. As Calvin tries to get through his day with the bickering and loud conversation, he is facing his own problems. A vacent lot across the street turns out to be a new hair salon called Nappy Cutz. Calvin decides that he can't have the shop shut down, as it is a neighborhood landmark, so he decides to style up the place. We also hear the story of old barber Eddie, who does not have to pay rent for his chair at the shop because of a story where he stands up to the rioters after the Martin Luther King Jr. assassination. But as the days go on, Calvin does not know what to do to be able to keep his customers who have been coming for years and years.""Barbershop 2"" really has better humor than the first. My favorite scene is where Gina and Eddie are having an arguement during a BBQ. Just listening to how well their comments play off on each other just adds to the fun that the orignal ""Barbershop"" movie created for us. Throughout both of these films, you could like the characters, and because of ""Barbershop 2"" you could just grow to liking them even more. The sequal could be seen without having seen the first, but the first one makes the second one great.

812680,A1HFVQZIDK7UUD,B0001Q4BOE,E.J. Rupert,"[4, 5]","""Barbershop 2: Back in Business"" (2004)This is a great movie, even funnier than the first at times. Kenan Thompson's role as Calvin's cousin was HILARIOUS (check him out on ""Saturday Night Live""). We get to learn more about the characters, especially Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer). His jokes are less cruel than in the first movie, but he is still the show-stealer. We also learn how he got his start in the barbershop and even how he fell in love with his wife (Garcelle Beauvais).What I don't understand, though, was Gina's (Queen Latifah) role in this film. Yeah, she used to date Calvin and her ribbing face-off with Eddie was funny, but she's not essential to the story. In fact, if you were to remove her and her beauty shop from the script, the story would still flow perfectly well. It seems as though the writers put Latifah in the script  to reassure the fans that this movie won't be another disappointing sequel. (Another reason may be to push her spinoff film, ""Beauty Salon"".)If you see this movie before the first Barbershop, you may be a little disappointed because this movie is character-driven (whereas the first one was plot-driven); so much of the characters' actions are based on what happened in the last movie (i.e., the communication between Ricky, Terri and Dinka). This makes it a good reason to see both movies.

The second part makes the first seems simple and weak.

Here in this movie, the conflicts centers around the ever changing problems that has plagued cities over the last decade--urban renewal. Not only are the characters are dealing with big companies posing as afro-sheeps but their very own enemies with a lot of cash at hand like nappycuts.com ,the website used in the movie, ready to undo what the owner and workers of the barbershop has been doing for a long time in just weeks what took them years to perfect and gain respect for.

""A New Yorker""","[1, 1]","I loved the first ""Barbershop"" but to me the sequel has a lot more in depth with its characters and we learn a little more about each one and how they have improved since the first film. If ""Back in Business"" has any flaws, it's that there is not enough action inside the barbershop, where most of the action took place in the first film. The movie is a bit of a repeat of the first movie (the barbershop is threatened by closure, this time by competition).  There is a little more drama with ""Back in Business"" that never slows the film down; a little drama never hurt anyone, did it? Either way, I did thoroughly enjoy it because it sprinkles some soul-pleasing themes about community, loyalty, and ethnic harmony.Queen Latifah makes a great addition to the cast, as the sharp-tongued proprietor of a beauty salon next door. Ice Cube, who I think has come along way, portrayed his character realistically and likeable but sometimes appear wooden at times. There is also a hilarious scene where the Alderman tries to have a photo opportunity in the barbershop and everything goes wrong. What's New to Barbershop 2 is the back story telling how Cedric The Entertainer's character came to be at the barbershop and the experiences of the barbershop back in the 50s and 60s (reminded me of an old ""Good Times"" episode). These scenes are well done and tells us whey Cedric The Entertainer's character is allowed to do virtually nothing at the barbershop.There are so many other good characters: Isaac (Troy Garity), Terri (Eve), Jimmy (Sean Patrick Thomas)... Too bad so many of the supporting characters rely on stereotypes. For instance, we know that the Alderman is corrupt and a pervert within seconds of seeing him, and that the ridiculously uptight-looking white man sitting next to Eddie on the train is going to say something stupid and ignorant. During that part I just shook my head, for some reason we are unable to stay away from those predicament.Barbershop 2: Back in Business' doesn't offer us anything new as far as content but I will recommend it because the shop scenes are just plain funny and sweet just like the first film.",3,[3.5]--Barbershop 2 Cuts a little bit deeper towards your scalp.,1159401600,"09 28, 2006",2006,2140,"['loved', 'first', 'Barbershop', 'sequel', 'lot', 'more', 'depth', 'characters', 'learn', 'little', 'more', 'one', 'how', 'have', 'improved', 'first', 'film', 'Back', 'Business', 'flaws', 'not', 'enough', 'action', 'barbershop', 'where', 'most', 'action', 'took', 'place', 'first', 'film', 'movie', 'bit', 'repeat', 'first', 'movie', 'barbershop', 'threatened', 'closure', 'time', 'competition', 'little', 'more', 'drama', 'Back', 'Business', 'never', 'film', 'down', 'little', 'drama', 'never', 'hurt', 'anyone', 'did', 'way', 'did', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'soul-pleasing', 'themes', 'community', 'loyalty', 'ethnic', 'harmony.Queen', 'Latifah', 'great', 'addition', 'cast', 'sharp-tongued', 'proprietor', 'beauty', 'salon', 'next', 'door', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'who', 'think', 'come', 'way', 'portrayed', 'character', 'realistically', 'likeable', 'sometimes', 'appear', 'wooden', 'times', 'also', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'where', 'Alderman', 'have', 'photo', 'opportunity', 'barbershop', 'everything', 'wrong', 'What', 'New', 'Barbershop', '2', 'back', 'story', 'telling', 'how', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'character', 'came', 'be', 'barbershop', 'experiences', 'barbershop', 'back', '50s', '60s', 'reminded', 'old', 'Good', 'Times', 'episode', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'character', 'allowed', 'do', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'good', 'characters', 'Isaac', 'Troy', 'Garity', 'Terri', 'Eve', 'Jimmy', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Thomas', 'Too', 'bad', 'so', 'many', 'supporting', 'characters', 'rely', 'stereotypes', 'instance', 'know', 'Alderman', 'corrupt', 'pervert', 'seconds', 'seeing', 'ridiculously', 'uptight-looking', 'white', 'man', 'sitting', 'next', 'Eddie', 'train', 'going', 'say', 'something', 'stupid', 'ignorant', 'part', 'just', 'shook', 'head', 'reason', 'are', 'unable', 'stay', 'away', 'predicament.Barbershop', '2', 'Back', 'Business', ""n't"", 'offer', 'anything', 'new', 'as', 'far', 'content', 'will', 'recommend', 'shop', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'funny', 'sweet', 'just', 'first', 'film']",Barbershop 2: Back in Business

812689,A1V8GY9ERC5T70,B0001Q4BOE,Kyle R. Pierson,"[0, 0]","One of the best segments from the Eddie Murphy/Arsenio Hall picture, COMING TO AMERICA, centered around each actor playing multiple characters at a barbershop.  Every character was unique, and every character had his own take on life.  When the original BARBERSHOP was released, I looked forward to much of that same banter.  Once the box office took off like a shot and word of mouth spread, it upset me that of all the movies I see in a year, I actually missed this one.  So, one night, I rented the video, popped some corn, and spent the night wondering why I wasn't seeing more of the barbershop.  I can't remember much of what went on, other than it seemed like the filmmakers spent way too much time on the subplot and too little time in the actual barbershop.  Whether or not that is completely accurate doesn't much matter, since I was bored to tears and don't care to revisit it.  However, with that said, I am very pleased to report that BARBERSHOP 2 manages to do everything right that, in my opinion, went wrong with our first visit.  Not only do we hear more from Cedric the Entertainer, we also visit his past which at times is comical, but at other times deeply moving.  This film has a message, but it doesn't shove it down your throat.  It has a series of subplots, but they all add to the flow of the movie, instead of distracting you from why you bought the ticket in the first place.  All of the performers have their moment in the spotlight and now the idea of the forthcoming BEAUTY SHOP doesn't seem like such a bad idea afterall.  Congratulations BARBERSHOP 2!

812693,APOUYO1BEPK22,B0001Q4BOE,"M. B Cole ""Kegrun""","[0, 0]","Calvin (Ice Cube) inherited his fathers Barbershop a few years back. At first he wasn't to happy with having the shop, but now the shop is a part of him. Calvin is now a rear part of the community, a corner stone of it. But change is coming into the neighborhood. Old shops, homes, and buildings are being bought out by a bigger corporation and replacing them with chains of restaurants, coffee houses, and even barbershops. And one of the barbershops, Nappy Cuts, is moving in right across from Calvin's shop. They offer nice chairs, better pampering, basketball courts, big screen TV's, and even fish in the floor you can pick out and get them cooked anyway you want it. Change is coming, and it isn't going to be pretty. To hopefully keep his shop as well as other peoples shops open, Calvin and the gang try their best to bring the community together to fight what some would consider the inevitable.I'm sure I'll be in the minority here, but I liked part 2 a lot more than part 1. I laughed more, the characters weren't as cookie cutter as in part 1 (but they still are somewhat), and the story was more enjoyable this time through... for me at least. I liked that it dealt with major corporations coming in and trying to undercut the competition to run them out of business. It felt a little more real than, the first movie where Calvin is being a little emo about inheriting a barbershop from his father, selling it, then trying to get it back. And the cast, well, I liked that they were a little less involved, but still there. You really don't pay attention to the fact that `everyone thinks the bad boy is just clubbin and having sex all the time at night, but what they don't know is that he's studying and trying to get an education', you know... things like that. And I really think the movie was a lot funnier than the first one. I laughed pretty hard at some things this time through. Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer) at one point is cooking some free burgers, and a little girl said hers was burnt. They argue about it and Eddie snatches it and throws it away. She goes and tell on him while Eddie is saying ""Go on! Go tell! I aint scurred of nuthin!"" Then Gina (Latifah) comes storming out the other shop yelling at Eddie. All Eddie says is ""OH SHOOT!"" (but cusses) and the look on his face is just priceless. So predictable, but so funny.I said barbershop 1 was a definite rent, and I would say the same with this. I'm glad I own them both, because even though they are very by the book, they are still some light hearted fun.P.S. - Kenan Thompson (Calvin's cousin)...is not funny. I have never laughed when that kid is trying to be funny. He's horrible on SNL also and just about anything he's been on. Even when he was on Nickelodeon. That guy just bugs me.

Rios,"[1, 1]","i saw and loved Barbershop, so when Barbershop 2 came out i was pretty excited, but man, what a let down.Barbershop 2 had some good stuff, real good stuff and hit more on the social life surrounding the Barbershop and the times of life between the late 60s, 70s, and the new hip hop urban wear era.movie centers around the area where the barbershop is located, and a group of investors want to come in and buy out the property cause they want to re-develop the area, and to top that off, a new more urban upscale barbershop that has a glass bottom with fish and a baseketball court opens up next to Calvin's barbershop driving away their customers forcing Calvin (Ice Cube) to compete and transform his shop also to an upscale more fashionable store.to top that off, all the characters have now gone under big changes, which is what i didn't like. Ricky is all of a sudden a school boy who falls in love with Eve, Dinka now has a girlfriend and no longer loves Terri (Eve), Jimmy (Sean Patrick Thomas) now works for the Mayor, Issac is now top dog of the barbershop, and Eddie now has more background story to tell. he isn't as funny as he was in part 1, but some of the parts he comes out in are nice, like the Kennedy-King TV scene where he defends the shop against a mob, or where he first becomes friends with Calvin's dad, and how Cavlin's dad treated him so well, which is why he loves the Barbershop so much. It puts the first Barbershop into better perspective.my favorite part in the movie was when they Calvin's dad and Eddie were watching the tv and Bobby Kennedy was giving his speech on the assassination of Martin Luther King to a crowd that had no idea he had been shot and killed. it's a touching realistic scene that puts that moment in perfect perspective.overall, Barbershop 2 is good, it's a nice movie, but if you're a big fan of the first, then part two might disappoint you. i was kind of disappointed. i still like the movie, but it was a let down from the first.",4,"some good stuff, but a let down from the first",1136678400,"01 8, 2006",2006,1987,"['i', 'saw', 'loved', 'Barbershop', 'so', 'when', 'Barbershop', '2', 'came', 'i', 'was', 'pretty', 'excited', 'man', 'what', 'let', 'down.Barbershop', '2', 'had', 'good', 'stuff', 'real', 'good', 'stuff', 'hit', 'more', 'social', 'life', 'surrounding', 'Barbershop', 'times', 'life', 'late', '60s', '70s', 'new', 'hip', 'hop', 'urban', 'wear', 'era.movie', 'centers', 'area', 'where', 'barbershop', 'located', 'group', 'investors', 'want', 'come', 'buy', 'out', 'property', 'cause', 'want', 're-develop', 'area', 'top', 'off', 'new', 'more', 'urban', 'upscale', 'barbershop', 'glass', 'bottom', 'fish', 'baseketball', 'court', 'up', 'next', 'Calvin', 'barbershop', 'driving', 'away', 'customers', 'forcing', 'Calvin', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'compete', 'transform', 'shop', 'also', 'upscale', 'more', 'fashionable', 'store.to', 'top', 'off', 'characters', 'have', 'now', 'gone', 'big', 'changes', 'what', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Ricky', 'sudden', 'school', 'boy', 'who', 'love', 'Eve', 'Dinka', 'now', 'girlfriend', 'longer', 'Terri', 'Eve', 'Jimmy', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Thomas', 'now', 'Mayor', 'Issac', 'now', 'top', 'dog', 'barbershop', 'Eddie', 'now', 'more', 'background', 'story', 'tell', ""n't"", 'as', 'funny', 'was', 'part', '1', 'parts', 'out', 'are', 'nice', 'Kennedy-King', 'TV', 'scene', 'where', 'shop', 'mob', 'where', 'first', 'friends', 'Calvin', 'dad', 'how', 'Cavlin', 'dad', 'treated', 'so', 'well', 'why', 'Barbershop', 'so', 'much', 'first', 'Barbershop', 'better', 'perspective.my', 'favorite', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'Calvin', 'dad', 'Eddie', 'were', 'watching', 'tv', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'giving', 'speech', 'assassination', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'crowd', 'had', 'idea', 'had', 'been', 'shot', 'killed', 'touching', 'realistic', 'scene', 'moment', 'perfect', 'perspective.overall', 'Barbershop', '2', 'good', 'nice', 'movie', ""'re"", 'big', 'fan', 'first', 'then', 'part', 'two', 'might', 'disappoint', 'i', 'was', 'kind', 'disappointed', 'i', 'still', 'movie', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'first']",Barbershop 2: Back in Business

Generally sequals pale in comparison to the original and just as generally, the public expects less.Hats off to the sequel to Barbershop which I found to be quite pleasing and enjoyable. The sequel is not ambitious and plot-wise is rather formulaic. What makes this work however, is the history, both of the characters as well as of African-Americans, that is seamlessly woven into the story to flesh out the characters and give the viewer a chance to understand the motivations behind their actions.A very interesting example is the way Isaac, the only white barber, is treated in the sequel. I submit that Ice-Cube is trying to give the audience a glimpse of what it must be like to be the minority in a given work situation. Instead of not balancing the opinion by only showing the effects this would have on a minority, he made a white man the minority and showed how exasperating and ultimately demeaning this kind of behavior can have on the oppressor as well as the one being oppressed.There were good jokes all around but somehow I found myself less interested in the laughs and more interested in the presentation of the message. Some may feel it descended into schmaltz, i.e., let's live together in peace, love and respect for the differences of your fellow man, etc. Conceding that these messages tend to be sentimental, when we look at what is happening today, this is infinitely more important a message than reinforcing the same old sterotypes.It is also wonderful to see the incomparable (and fine!) Harry J. Lennix. Even though he played the protagonist, he nonetheless elevated the production with his sterling portrayal of the businessman whose main concern is making money at the expense of the rich historic tradition of the neighbborhood.Worthy outing indeed!",3,Surprsingly Good!!!!!!!!!!!,1111536000,"03 23, 2005",2005,1859,"['do', 'not', 'mean', 'imply', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'sequel', 'came', 'off', 'Generally', 'sequals', 'pale', 'comparison', 'original', 'just', 'generally', 'public', 'less.Hats', 'sequel', 'Barbershop', 'found', 'be', 'quite', 'pleasing', 'enjoyable', 'sequel', 'not', 'ambitious', 'plot-wise', 'rather', 'formulaic', 'What', 'work', 'however', 'history', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'African-Americans', 'seamlessly', 'woven', 'story', 'flesh', 'out', 'characters', 'give', 'viewer', 'chance', 'understand', 'motivations', 'actions.A', 'very', 'interesting', 'example', 'way', 'Isaac', 'only', 'white', 'barber', 'treated', 'sequel', 'submit', 'Ice-Cube', 'trying', 'give', 'audience', 'glimpse', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'be', 'minority', 'given', 'work', 'situation', 'Instead', 'not', 'balancing', 'opinion', 'only', 'showing', 'effects', 'would', 'have', 'minority', 'made', 'white', 'man', 'minority', 'showed', 'how', 'exasperating', 'ultimately', 'demeaning', 'kind', 'behavior', 'can', 'have', 'oppressor', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'being', 'were', 'good', 'jokes', 'around', 'somehow', 'found', 'less', 'interested', 'laughs', 'more', 'interested', 'presentation', 'message', 'may', 'feel', 'descended', 'schmaltz', 'i.e.', 'let', 'live', 'together', 'peace', 'love', 'respect', 'differences', 'fellow', 'man', 'etc', 'Conceding', 'messages', 'tend', 'be', 'sentimental', 'when', 'look', 'what', 'happening', 'today', 'infinitely', 'more', 'important', 'message', 'reinforcing', 'same', 'old', 'sterotypes.It', 'also', 'wonderful', 'see', 'incomparable', 'fine', 'Harry', 'J.', 'Lennix', 'Even', 'played', 'protagonist', 'nonetheless', 'elevated', 'production', 'sterling', 'portrayal', 'businessman', 'main', 'concern', 'making', 'money', 'expense', 'rich', 'historic', 'tradition', 'neighbborhood.Worthy', 'outing', 'indeed']",Barbershop 2: Back in Business

In the first one, the comedy was so off the top the characters became almost became cartoon like.  I liked the fact that the director got a chance to actually expand the depth of the characters (Eddie, Calvin, Terry, Yinka, Ricky, and Jimmy) and give the audience a chance to see their actual personal lives away from the barbershop so to speak.  It's usually hard to do that when you have so many characters jumbled up into one movie, but Kevin Rodney Sullivan was able to pull it off with the sequel.  Showing the secret behind Eddie's love of the barbershop and why he and Calvin's father were so close gave me a better understanding of his character and why he is so outspoken with his young counterparts.  Seeing Ricky's character put aside all the street b.s. to try and better himself and get his G.E.D. was a plus, and I felt him when he said once he got it, he really doesn't know what it all means.  We've all been there at that age.  Eventhough near the end of the movie when Calvin was offered the $200,000 to convince folks to sell the properties and accept change, it shows in our &quot;bling bling&quot; materialistic &amp; capitalistic society, a thing such as principal, and the right thing to do does still exist, even if it's only on the big screen.

Zwick,"[1, 1]","""Barbershop 2: Back in Business"" isn't quite as funny as the first ""Barbershop,"" but it still has that same freeform looseness that made the original such a crossover hit.  As with the earlier film, ""Back in Business"" is little more than a string of conversations held together by the barest minimum of a storyline.  Calvin's shop is a neighborhood institution steeped in tradition, with a long and honorable history of providing conversation and companionship along with its services.  In this installment, the shop faces a threat from a posh new haircutting franchise that is opening up across the street as part of a local redevelopment plan.  It's a classic case of David vs. Goliath, with Calvin (Ice Cube) and his cohorts taking on the two-headed giant of corrupt politicians and corporate greed.The plot is always the least of the matters in the ""Barbershop"" films; what counts is the playful interaction amongst the various characters, as well as the shrewd, sharp-eyed and often acerbic observations made by the resident jokester, Eddie, marvelously played by Cedric the Entertainer.  Eddie is not afraid to take on any number of ""sacred cows"" in the black community even if it means offending certain members of the audience. The only complaint I have about Cedric is that he mumbles so much that it is often hard to understand what it is he`s saying.  Still, the scene in which he goes toe-to-toe and mano-a-mano with Queen Latifah is alone worth the price of admission.  As Calvin, Ice Cube once again provides the solid center of sanity and rationality around which all the craziness can swirl.The material isn't as fresh the second time around, but ""Barbershop 2"" provides a few good laughs, some decent sentiment and a chance to spend some additional time with a group of characters who know how to have a little fun with life even when life itself doesn`t always make that so easy to do.",3,passable sequel,1096156800,"09 26, 2004",2004,1903,"['2', 'Back', 'Business', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'funny', 'first', 'Barbershop', 'still', 'same', 'freeform', 'looseness', 'made', 'original', 'such', 'crossover', 'hit', 'earlier', 'film', 'Back', 'Business', 'little', 'more', 'string', 'conversations', 'held', 'together', 'barest', 'minimum', 'storyline', 'Calvin', 'shop', 'neighborhood', 'institution', 'steeped', 'tradition', 'long', 'honorable', 'history', 'providing', 'conversation', 'companionship', 'services', 'installment', 'shop', 'threat', 'posh', 'new', 'haircutting', 'franchise', 'opening', 'up', 'street', 'part', 'local', 'redevelopment', 'plan', 'classic', 'case', 'David', 'vs.', 'Goliath', 'Calvin', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'cohorts', 'taking', 'two-headed', 'giant', 'corrupt', 'politicians', 'corporate', 'greed.The', 'plot', 'always', 'least', 'matters', 'Barbershop', 'films', 'what', 'playful', 'interaction', 'various', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'shrewd', 'sharp-eyed', 'often', 'acerbic', 'observations', 'made', 'resident', 'jokester', 'Eddie', 'marvelously', 'played', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'Eddie', 'not', 'afraid', 'take', 'number', 'sacred', 'cows', 'black', 'community', 'even', 'offending', 'certain', 'members', 'audience', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'Cedric', 'so', 'much', 'often', 'hard', 'understand', 'what', 's', 'saying', 'Still', 'scene', 'toe-to-toe', 'mano-a-mano', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'alone', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'Calvin', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'once', 'again', 'solid', 'center', 'sanity', 'rationality', 'craziness', 'can', 'swirl.The', 'material', ""n't"", 'fresh', 'second', 'time', 'Barbershop', '2', 'few', 'good', 'laughs', 'decent', 'sentiment', 'chance', 'spend', 'additional', 'time', 'group', 'characters', 'who', 'know', 'how', 'have', 'little', 'fun', 'life', 'even', 'when', 'life', 'doesn', 't', 'always', 'make', 'so', 'easy', 'do']",Barbershop 2: Back in Business

812715,A3PJXZOYC8026Z,B0001Q4BOE,Simon Crowe,"[2, 2]","This is the sequel to the popular comedy of 2 years ago. Almost the entire cast is back, and the sequel feels tighter and stronger.The populist, pro-small business, message is carried over from the first film. Calvin (Ice Cube) is running the barbershop started by his late father. When a chain hair cutting place opens across the street and the neighborhood begins to gentrify, Calvin must decide whether to sell out or rally the neighborhood to his cause. The role of the barbershop in the community is celebrated, particularly in a subplot involving Eddie (the excellent Cedric the Entertainer, whose role is greatly expanded) saving the shop from being destroyed by rioters in the '60s. Cedric provides most of the laughs, and handles the serious scenes well too, this is a breakout performance.The ending of the film is entirely predictable, yet throughly enjoyable, so let's just mention that the cast is uniformly good, especially Troy Garity as the lone white barber, Kenan Thompson as Calvin's inept cousin, Robert Wisdom as a crooked politician, and Queen Latifah, who brings an anarchic energy to her small role as the owner of the neighboring beauty shop.BARBERSHOP 2 celebrates the importance of neighborhood and community in an era of increasing homogenization.

812720,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B0001Q4BOE,Tucker Andersen,"[2, 2]","This is a wonderful sequel to BARBERSHOP; one of the factors that makes it so enjoyable is that the director and producers chose to build on the strengths of that film rather than attempt to duplicate it. Calvin (Ice Cube) and Eddie (Cedric The Entertainer) head the ensemble cast that we got to know in the first film, and Queen Latifah once again exhibits her charm on the screen. The main storyline is very straightforward and reflects a conflict that takes place in countless cities across the country: the effect of change on the neighborhood. What appears as progress to the agents of change may in fact pose a threat to the established order of things. But the attraction of this film is clearly not due to a unique or suspenseful storyline, but rather to the interaction of the characters and the questions which the film raises and the history which the story reveals. We met everyone in the debut film and got acquainted with their home turf - Calvin's BARBERSHOP on the South Side of Chicago. Now we feel like we get to know them and understand them, see their progress and learn how they have coped with life.The film opens with an historical flashback, and this technique is employed repeatedly and effectively throughout the film. Much of Eddie's past is introduced in this way, and we develop a real understanding of the life experiences which inform his homespun observations. We also learn that his help for Calvin's father in protecting the barbershop from harm during the riots and looting of the sixties is the genesis of his lifetime ""free chair"" at the shop. The plot is nominally about a next generation upscale Nappy Cutz salon preparing to open across the street as part of a major neighborhood redevelopment plan. Of course, the threat to Calvin and his employees is obvious, and as is usually the case in such situations, there are neighborhood divisions about the political deals which are being made and concern about the disruption of lives which may result.This is in many ways a much more subtle film than the original.  The most explosive racial situations which are portrayed took place in the past, which makes them a lot less threatening. Cedric's rhetoric in this film is certainly unlikely to create the loud (and mostly ignored) protests which the first film evoked from the professional arbiters of political correctness and those complainers constantly aggrieved by every imagined slight. The offensive language has also been considerably toned down and the sexual innuendos are infrequent and low key.  So this is as much fun as the original BARBERSHOP but without the shock value. However, serious questions about how people achieve their goals in life, the obstacles to be overcome, and the question of identity (individual as well as neighborhood) are all seriously examined in a very enjoyable film. So while this is not a masterpiece it definitely is a very worthwhile hour and a half and a chance to catch up with some friends from the last film. One caution is necessary in that regard, however. THIS IS A SEQUEL THAT WILL BE MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE AND MEANINGFUL IF YOU FIRST WATCH THE ORIGINAL (as long as the language is not too offensive). The relationships developed among the characters in the first movie are often built upon in this one, and that background and feeling of familiarity was an integral part of my enjoyment of this film.Tucker Andersen",4,An Entertaining Sequel That Also Provides Some History,1076371200,"02 10, 2004",2004,3404,"['wonderful', 'sequel', 'BARBERSHOP', 'one', 'factors', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'director', 'producers', 'chose', 'build', 'strengths', 'film', 'rather', 'attempt', 'duplicate', 'Calvin', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'Eddie', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'head', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'got', 'know', 'first', 'film', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'once', 'again', 'charm', 'screen', 'main', 'storyline', 'very', 'straightforward', 'conflict', 'place', 'countless', 'cities', 'country', 'effect', 'change', 'neighborhood', 'What', 'as', 'progress', 'agents', 'change', 'may', 'fact', 'pose', 'threat', 'established', 'order', 'things', 'attraction', 'film', 'clearly', 'not', 'due', 'unique', 'suspenseful', 'storyline', 'rather', 'interaction', 'characters', 'questions', 'film', 'history', 'story', 'reveals', 'met', 'everyone', 'debut', 'film', 'got', 'acquainted', 'home', 'turf', 'Calvin', 'BARBERSHOP', 'South', 'Side', 'Chicago', 'Now', 'feel', 'get', 'know', 'understand', 'see', 'progress', 'learn', 'how', 'have', 'coped', 'life.The', 'film', 'historical', 'flashback', 'technique', 'employed', 'repeatedly', 'effectively', 'film', 'Much', 'Eddie', 'past', 'introduced', 'way', 'develop', 'real', 'understanding', 'life', 'experiences', 'inform', 'homespun', 'observations', 'also', 'learn', 'help', 'Calvin', 'father', 'protecting', 'barbershop', 'harm', 'riots', 'looting', 'sixties', 'genesis', 'lifetime', 'free', 'chair', 'shop', 'plot', 'nominally', 'next', 'generation', 'upscale', 'Nappy', 'Cutz', 'salon', 'preparing', 'open', 'street', 'part', 'major', 'neighborhood', 'redevelopment', 'plan', 'course', 'threat', 'Calvin', 'employees', 'obvious', 'usually', 'case', 'such', 'situations', 'are', 'neighborhood', 'divisions', 'political', 'deals', 'are', 'being', 'made', 'concern', 'disruption', 'lives', 'may', 'result.This', 'many', 'ways', 'much', 'more', 'subtle', 'film', 'original', 'most', 'explosive', 'racial', 'situations', 'are', 'portrayed', 'took', 'place', 'past', 'lot', 'less', 'threatening', 'Cedric', 'rhetoric', 'film', 'certainly', 'unlikely', 'create', 'loud', 'mostly', 'ignored', 'protests', 'first', 'film', 'evoked', 'professional', 'arbiters', 'political', 'correctness', 'complainers', 'constantly', 'aggrieved', 'imagined', 'slight', 'offensive', 'language', 'also', 'been', 'considerably', 'toned', 'down', 'sexual', 'innuendos', 'are', 'infrequent', 'low', 'key', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'original', 'BARBERSHOP', 'shock', 'value', 'However', 'serious', 'questions', 'how', 'people', 'achieve', 'goals', 'life', 'obstacles', 'be', 'overcome', 'question', 'identity', 'individual', 'as', 'well', 'neighborhood', 'are', 'seriously', 'examined', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'So', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'definitely', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'hour', 'half', 'chance', 'catch', 'up', 'friends', 'last', 'film', 'One', 'caution', 'necessary', 'regard', 'however', 'THIS', 'SEQUEL', 'THAT', 'WILL', 'BE', 'MUCH', 'MORE', 'ENJOYABLE', 'AND', 'MEANINGFUL', 'IF', 'YOU', 'FIRST', 'WATCH', 'THE', 'ORIGINAL', 'as', 'long', 'language', 'not', 'too', 'offensive', 'relationships', 'developed', 'characters', 'first', 'movie', 'are', 'often', 'built', 'one', 'background', 'feeling', 'familiarity', 'was', 'integral', 'part', 'enjoyment', 'film.Tucker', 'Andersen']",Barbershop 2: Back in Business
