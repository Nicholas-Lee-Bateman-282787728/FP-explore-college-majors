I love Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix so when I saw both of these together for such a low price ($4.99 when I bought it) I couldn't say, no. The package came on time with no damage.

Signs is scary in parts, its a fingernail biter.  The village is a great story of escaping the problems of today and going to a simpler time.  Some people hate this movie, because I feel they just don't get it.  I actually appreciate the story line and the choice of actors in it.  Great movies for a dark, dreary day or Halloween night.",5,Signs/The Village,1237939200,"03 25, 2009",2009,441,"['Arrived', 'quickly', 'package', 'perfect', 'love', 'two', 'movies', 'kept', 'edge', 'seat', 'Signs', 'scary', 'parts', 'fingernail', 'biter', 'village', 'great', 'story', 'escaping', 'problems', 'today', 'going', 'simpler', 'time', 'people', 'hate', 'movie', 'feel', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'actually', 'appreciate', 'story', 'line', 'choice', 'actors', 'Great', 'movies', 'dark', 'dreary', 'day', 'Halloween', 'night']",N/A
