I distinctly remember that Stella's breasts were exposed in that scene. This dvd doesn't have that shot.  I googled for VHS screen caps and sure enough, my memory was correct. It's been cut from the dvd.  That's just one shot of course and might not bother anyone in the least, but it makes me wonder if there are any other scenes that are missing. So I'm going ahead and purchasing the VHS as well.  The dvd is still a great buy for the special features which includes an interview with Perry King, the writer and producer.If I DO see any additional scenes on the VHS, I'll be sure to add the information here.12/9/11 UPDATE: Unfortunately the VHS is edited as well. I've done some research and from the looks of it, HBO was the only place to see it in it's entirety.  Here's to hoping a full version is released eventually (along with a cleaner print).",5,Edited dvd,1322524800,"11 29, 2011",2011,975,"['5', 'star', 'movie', 'dvd', 'edited', 'noticed', 'very', 'first', 'love', 'scene', 'where', 'are', 'eating', 'cake', 'distinctly', 'remember', 'Stella', 'breasts', 'were', 'exposed', 'scene', 'dvd', ""n't"", 'have', 'shot', 'googled', 'VHS', 'screen', 'caps', 'sure', 'enough', 'memory', 'was', 'correct', 'been', 'cut', 'dvd', 'just', 'one', 'shot', 'course', 'might', 'not', 'bother', 'anyone', 'least', 'wonder', 'are', 'other', 'scenes', 'are', 'missing', ""'m"", 'going', 'ahead', 'purchasing', 'VHS', 'as', 'well', 'dvd', 'still', 'great', 'buy', 'special', 'features', 'interview', 'Perry', 'King', 'writer', 'producer.If', 'DO', 'see', 'additional', 'scenes', 'VHS', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sure', 'add', 'information', 'here.12/9/11', 'UPDATE', 'Unfortunately', 'VHS', 'edited', 'as', 'well', ""'ve"", 'done', 'research', 'looks', 'HBO', 'was', 'only', 'place', 'see', 'entirety', 'Here', 'hoping', 'full', 'version', 'released', 'eventually', 'cleaner', 'print']",N/A

992838,A1XHZGO4JZTZNJ,B000FNNHZ2,Lucas_M.,"[10, 14]","One will no doubt read many venomous reviews of this film. Most were written by offended homosexuals. Ignore them. This film seems more keen to explore gender roles rather than just being another gay platform. Personally, sexuality has never simplified anything, in my opinion. So I don't want a predictable plotline from a film that deals with this subject matter. You won't find that sort of predictabitlity here.This is a brave cinematic work for its time and seems even more courageous today. The basic plot: an illegal, gay immigrant is befriended by a gay real estate agent. One drunken evening, the consumate their friendship, which results in a pregnancy. The become a couple, get married and begin dealing with day to day struggles.Honest, complex, and engaging, I highly recommend viewing this film. Again, it is my belief that it was intended to tackle gender assigment, and it does so. There are rather harrowing consequences for the two characters, but I won't ruin it for anyone.",5,"""Yes, I have.

992840,A16J5IIA94TJOB,B000FNNHZ2,Scott Dorn,"[0, 0]","This is possibly the first mainstream film to treat Gay characters with compassion and understanding! In other words, no one dies a horrible death in this or is self loathing and suicidal! Perry King plays a Gay man who is comfortable with his own sexuality and Meg Foster plays a Gay woman, who likewise is comfortable with herself.....fate throws the two of them together as Perry's character fears being deported. The two of them get married to solve that problem but plan to live their lives separately as they had before. However, a night of drinking finds them in bed together resulting in a pregnancy. Instead of driving them apart, this brings them closer together and eventually, to the surprise of both, they fall in love. Some may have a problem with how this film plays out, (It's not quite what you might expect), and this is why this is a different story!King and Foster have a lot of chemistry together and are so likeable that you can't help but root for them!If you want to see a truly ""different"" romantic film then you might want to check this one out.",4,"Definitely ""A Different Story""!",1338163200,"05 28, 2012",2012,1071,"['possibly', 'first', 'mainstream', 'film', 'treat', 'Gay', 'characters', 'compassion', 'understanding', 'other', 'words', 'one', 'horrible', 'death', 'self', 'loathing', 'suicidal', 'Perry', 'King', 'Gay', 'man', 'who', 'comfortable', 'own', 'sexuality', 'Meg', 'Foster', 'Gay', 'woman', 'who', 'likewise', 'comfortable', '..fate', 'two', 'together', 'Perry', 'character', 'fears', 'being', 'deported', 'two', 'get', 'married', 'solve', 'problem', 'plan', 'live', 'lives', 'separately', 'had', 'However', 'night', 'drinking', 'finds', 'bed', 'together', 'resulting', 'pregnancy', 'Instead', 'driving', 'apart', 'closer', 'together', 'eventually', 'surprise', 'fall', 'love', 'may', 'have', 'problem', 'how', 'film', 'out', 'not', 'quite', 'what', 'might', 'expect', 'why', 'different', 'story', 'King', 'Foster', 'have', 'lot', 'chemistry', 'together', 'are', 'so', 'likeable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'root', 'want', 'see', 'truly', 'different', 'romantic', 'film', 'then', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'one', 'out']",N/A
