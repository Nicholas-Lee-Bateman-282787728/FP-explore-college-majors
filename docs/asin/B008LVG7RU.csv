1570146,A23FJSE5AMGISF,B008LVG7RU,Charles Hall,"[1, 1]","As the other reviewers have said this is a well made documentary about some important science that was done at this observatory (which I never heard of before). It profiles a couple of the most famous astronomers in more depth, and covers some general history as well. Documentaries like this make the 19th century sound so exciting! Some nice bonus features tie in to current activity at the observatory.I only have two gripes. The minor gripe is that the story is a little disrupted and hard to follow. One minute it is chronological order and in the next scene they've backed up to follow a different thread. I suppose there are limitations on what you can do in a certain amount of time.My second gripe is that they waste a significant amount of that precious time attempting to rehabilitate Samuel Langley's place in the history of aviation. As you may know, he was a contemporary of the Wright brothers but his ""aerodrome"" instead of flying slipped into the Potomac like a ""handful of concrete"" as one reporter put it. And many thousands of your tax dollars went with it. Many other inventors got that far (think Maxim's steam powered airplane which also never flew). In no way should his accomplishments in aviation be compared to the Wright brothers, but they try as hard as they can to imply that without actually lying (as the Smithsonian did for 40 years). His role as an astronomer is fascinating, his career as an airplane designer was a total failure and I don't know why they mention it at all.",4,"Very good, but with minor flaws",1362873600,"03 10, 2013",2013,1509,"['other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'well', 'made', 'documentary', 'important', 'science', 'was', 'done', 'observatory', 'never', 'heard', 'before', 'couple', 'most', 'famous', 'astronomers', 'more', 'depth', 'general', 'history', 'as', 'well', 'Documentaries', 'make', '19th', 'century', 'sound', 'exciting', 'nice', 'bonus', 'features', 'tie', 'current', 'activity', 'observatory.I', 'only', 'have', 'two', 'gripes', 'minor', 'gripe', 'story', 'little', 'disrupted', 'hard', 'follow', 'One', 'minute', 'chronological', 'order', 'next', 'scene', ""'ve"", 'backed', 'up', 'follow', 'different', 'thread', 'suppose', 'are', 'limitations', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'certain', 'amount', 'time.My', 'second', 'gripe', 'waste', 'significant', 'amount', 'precious', 'time', 'attempting', 'rehabilitate', 'Samuel', 'Langley', 'place', 'history', 'aviation', 'may', 'know', 'was', 'contemporary', 'Wright', 'brothers', 'aerodrome', 'instead', 'flying', 'slipped', 'Potomac', 'handful', 'concrete', 'one', 'reporter', 'put', 'many', 'thousands', 'tax', 'dollars', 'went', 'Many', 'other', 'inventors', 'got', 'far', 'think', 'Maxim', 'steam', 'powered', 'airplane', 'also', 'never', 'flew', 'way', 'should', 'accomplishments', 'aviation', 'be', 'compared', 'Wright', 'brothers', 'try', 'as', 'hard', 'can', 'imply', 'actually', 'lying', 'Smithsonian', 'did', '40', 'years', 'role', 'astronomer', 'fascinating', 'career', 'airplane', 'designer', 'was', 'total', 'failure', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'mention']",N/A
