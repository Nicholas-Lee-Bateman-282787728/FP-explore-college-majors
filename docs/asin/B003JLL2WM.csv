I love watching Dog the Bounty Hunter and enjoyed each episode  in this collection.I just wished it was at least a two-disc set with more episodes and maybe some deleted scenes. BTW, it was funny seeing Dog and his son walking through the airport all serious with cameramen trailing them(episode ""No Fly Zone"").

1347578,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B003JLL2WM,Haunted Flower,"[4, 6]","8 Episodes on 1 Disc, 176 Minutes, released July 27, 2010""Dog the Bounty Hunter"" on DVD is a collection of eight ""top-rated"" episodes previously unreleased on DVD from the 2009-2010 season featuring Dog, the Bounty Hunter and his family bounty hunting team in Denver, Colorado hunting down fugitives who have jumped bail.The Dog, Beth, Baby Lyssa, Duane Lee, and Leland are all characters to say the least. They dress less than conspicuously mostly in biker apparel with the ladies having heavy eye makeup and the Dog always in a button down shirt unbuttoned pretty far to show his star badge necklace and chest. All of the bounty hunters are intense and pretty committed to their jobs and always ready for the worst even though they luckily rarely face anything worth being mildly concerned over. Playing up the drama and remembering to summarize for the cameras is a mastered talent.Every episode describes someone who has jumped bail as they put up all the big facts on their white board and talk about why this person in particular is ESPECIALLY likely to run. Funny thing is...none of them ever do. They usually seem mildly surprised, confused by the cameras, and are in handcuffs before they have a chance to protest. What's even more amusing is how many people are willing to snitch about their family, friends, or neighbors! They see the ""Dog"" and try to give a straight-faced interview but the corners of their mouths are always creeping towards a smile because they love the thrill of being on TV.The stakeouts are hilarious because the whole group will be in tough, black leather clothes standing around the entrance to a place WITH a camera crew radioing each other to get into place. If I were a fugitive, I could spot that situation a mile away and just leave! But once again, they catch almost every one eventually and nobody really runs.One great example was the team thought this lady was ""on the run"" and had informants calling them constantly about where her Honda was and that it left the house so obviously someone had tipped her off that they were coming! Then it turns out she was headed to a laundromat to meet her daughter. When she didn't show, again the group thought that this meant she was running. Eventually it came out that she was lazy and decided to eat under a pavilion at a scenic rest spot rather than help her daughter with laundry and got caught with picnicware in her hand that she had to drop immediately when they all barged in shouting at her.They also get to throw in the softer side with some family moments with the kids welcoming new pets, taking Baby Lyssa in for an ultra sound of her baby, and before every hunt the family gets in a circle and says a quick prayer for their safety and then jump into a ""Let's kick some *ss!"" mentality. At the end of each episode, the Dog and Beth usually try to give words of parting wisdom to the offenders so that they might turn their life around which they promise to do on camera.Merits or not, this series is still really amusing for a ""reality"" TV show and I almost wish it was a scripted drama with a bigger budget because then the criminals they went after could be more interesting. The hunters have character by the bucket loads, but the people they hunt in this set are pretty tame and don't create much in the way of drama. It makes the team's exuberant attitude seem a little silly and like overkill at times.The BEST thing about this series is the opening theme ""Dog the Bounty Hunter"" by Ozzy Osbourne. It is AWESOME and will get stuck in your head forever. If you haven't already, look for this song on iTunes and then also look for the episode of ""South Park"" where Cartman is made Hall Monitor and becomes Dog the Bounty Hunter and sings his own version of the theme song. I posted two clips from that episode from Season 10 of ""South Park"" below so check them out, they are HILARIOUS!Bonus Features: There are none but at Amazon's cheap price of $10.99, it seems pretty fair.",4,"Dog, the Bounty Hunter hunts in Denver",1283817600,"09 7, 2010",2010,3979,"['8', 'Episodes', '1', 'Disc', '176', 'Minutes', 'released', 'July', '27', '2010', 'Bounty', 'Hunter', 'DVD', 'collection', 'eight', 'top-rated', 'previously', 'unreleased', 'DVD', '2009-2010', 'season', 'featuring', 'Dog', 'Bounty', 'Hunter', 'family', 'bounty', 'hunting', 'team', 'Denver', 'Colorado', 'hunting', 'down', 'fugitives', 'who', 'have', 'jumped', 'bail.The', 'Dog', 'Beth', 'Baby', 'Lyssa', 'Duane', 'Lee', 'Leland', 'are', 'characters', 'say', 'least', 'dress', 'less', 'conspicuously', 'mostly', 'biker', 'apparel', 'ladies', 'having', 'heavy', 'eye', 'makeup', 'Dog', 'always', 'button', 'down', 'shirt', 'unbuttoned', 'pretty', 'far', 'show', 'star', 'badge', 'necklace', 'chest', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'are', 'intense', 'pretty', 'committed', 'jobs', 'always', 'ready', 'worst', 'even', 'luckily', 'rarely', 'face', 'anything', 'worth', 'being', 'mildly', 'concerned', 'Playing', 'up', 'drama', 'remembering', 'summarize', 'cameras', 'mastered', 'talent.Every', 'episode', 'someone', 'who', 'jumped', 'bail', 'put', 'up', 'big', 'facts', 'white', 'board', 'talk', 'why', 'person', 'particular', 'ESPECIALLY', 'likely', 'run', 'Funny', 'thing', 'none', 'ever', 'do', 'usually', 'seem', 'mildly', 'surprised', 'confused', 'cameras', 'are', 'handcuffs', 'have', 'chance', 'protest', 'What', 'even', 'more', 'amusing', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'willing', 'snitch', 'family', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'see', 'Dog', 'try', 'give', 'straight-faced', 'interview', 'corners', 'mouths', 'are', 'always', 'creeping', 'smile', 'love', 'thrill', 'being', 'TV.The', 'stakeouts', 'are', 'hilarious', 'whole', 'group', 'will', 'be', 'tough', 'black', 'leather', 'clothes', 'standing', 'entrance', 'place', 'WITH', 'camera', 'crew', 'radioing', 'other', 'get', 'place', 'were', 'fugitive', 'could', 'spot', 'situation', 'mile', 'away', 'just', 'leave', 'once', 'again', 'catch', 'almost', 'one', 'eventually', 'nobody', 'really', 'great', 'example', 'was', 'team', 'thought', 'lady', 'was', 'run', 'had', 'informants', 'calling', 'constantly', 'where', 'Honda', 'was', 'left', 'house', 'so', 'obviously', 'someone', 'had', 'tipped', 'off', 'were', 'coming', 'Then', 'out', 'was', 'headed', 'laundromat', 'meet', 'daughter', 'When', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'again', 'group', 'thought', 'meant', 'was', 'running', 'Eventually', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'lazy', 'decided', 'eat', 'pavilion', 'scenic', 'rest', 'spot', 'rather', 'help', 'daughter', 'laundry', 'got', 'caught', 'picnicware', 'hand', 'had', 'drop', 'immediately', 'when', 'barged', 'shouting', 'her.They', 'also', 'get', 'throw', 'softer', 'side', 'family', 'moments', 'kids', 'welcoming', 'new', 'pets', 'taking', 'Baby', 'Lyssa', 'ultra', 'sound', 'baby', 'hunt', 'family', 'circle', 'quick', 'prayer', 'safety', 'then', 'jump', 'Let', 'kick', '*ss', 'mentality', 'end', 'episode', 'Dog', 'Beth', 'usually', 'try', 'give', 'words', 'parting', 'wisdom', 'offenders', 'might', 'turn', 'life', 'promise', 'do', 'camera.Merits', 'not', 'series', 'still', 'really', 'amusing', 'reality', 'TV', 'show', 'almost', 'wish', 'was', 'scripted', 'drama', 'bigger', 'budget', 'then', 'criminals', 'went', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'hunters', 'have', 'character', 'bucket', 'people', 'hunt', 'set', 'are', 'pretty', 'tame', 'do', ""n't"", 'create', 'much', 'way', 'drama', 'team', 'exuberant', 'attitude', 'seem', 'little', 'silly', 'like', 'overkill', 'times.The', 'BEST', 'thing', 'series', 'opening', 'theme', 'Dog', 'Bounty', 'Hunter', 'Ozzy', 'Osbourne', 'AWESOME', 'will', 'get', 'stuck', 'head', 'forever', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'look', 'song', 'iTunes', 'then', 'also', 'look', 'episode', 'South', 'Park', 'where', 'Cartman', 'made', 'Hall', 'Monitor', 'Dog', 'Bounty', 'Hunter', 'sings', 'own', 'version', 'theme', 'song', 'posted', 'two', 'clips', 'episode', 'Season', '10', 'South', 'Park', 'so', 'check', 'out', 'are', 'HILARIOUS', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'are', 'none', 'Amazon', 'cheap', 'price', '10.99', 'pretty', 'fair']",N/A

1347583,ABBBP0HLLXJZ9,B003JLL2WM,"Rhonda Poynter ""gannon'smom""","[10, 11]","Everyone knows by now that Dog has got a mullet that actually kind of looks cool on him, Beth could bitch-slap that Dolly Parton everyone compares her to all the way back to Tennessee, and various family members, friends and old 'brahs' that owe one another back up and favors will jam-pack an episode of any Dog The Bounty Hunter.If you have seen the show, this DVD being made up of eight previously unseen eps (at the time of release, I believe this may have come out around the time Dog's mouth got him yanked from the airwaves for awhile) will really hold nothing new...it is actually easier not to critique the episodes themselves, believe it or not, and note, instead, the heart of the DVD. Yep, gonna get cosmic. I have a few of Dog's DVDs, and it becomes endless how many junkies, boosters, drug dealers, on and on, he and his group go after and round up like a  neo-noir Roy Rogers and Dale Evans trying to lasso the Apocalypse. What actually sticks in the viewer's head more than the names and the charges is that Dog, Beth and the rest really seem to believe what they are preaching - they don't want to have to bust their fellow human beings, they've both been busted themselves and they know it ain't no way to spend a summer evening -, but they'll take the man or woman in question down in the hope that it might be the turning point in the bad guy's life. Dog especially comes across as The Voice Of Experience, and when he sends one of those knowing looks toward the camera, you can literally feel his pain, and only imagine what he's seen and gone through. I'm a Sure-they-do Sally sometimes, when it comes to listening to somebody preach that they just want to help people turn around before it's too late, etc., but Dog and Beth truly and consistently come across as sincere in what these DVDS film them trying to do...when Dog starts talking about what he crawled out of, you know he knows he's one of the lucky few, and you're actually glad to be spending the money to hear his message.
