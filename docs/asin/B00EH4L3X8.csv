I'm going to miss Trevor Eve and his team, but they go out with some explosive episodes. I'm not sure they would have topped them had the series continued, but I would have loved to see them try.Harbinger, Care, and Waterloo are very dark and definitely not for the squeamish. In Solidarity, we get a look into Grace's younger, more radical days. And in Conviction, the team encounters superstitions and misunderstandings that lead to tragic consequences.Waking the Dead definitely exits on a very high note. I just wish there were more seasons to come. If you follow this series, don't miss season 9; and if you don't, I envy you having all 9 seasons ahead of you.",5,Leaves me wanting more,1403913600,"06 28, 2014",2014,741,"['Season', '9', 'Waking', 'Dead', 'amazing', 'finale', 'wonderful', 'series', ""'m"", 'going', 'miss', 'Trevor', 'Eve', 'team', 'go', 'out', 'explosive', 'episodes', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'topped', 'had', 'series', 'continued', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'try.Harbinger', 'Care', 'Waterloo', 'are', 'very', 'dark', 'definitely', 'not', 'squeamish', 'Solidarity', 'get', 'look', 'Grace', 'younger', 'more', 'radical', 'days', 'Conviction', 'team', 'encounters', 'superstitions', 'misunderstandings', 'lead', 'tragic', 'consequences.Waking', 'Dead', 'definitely', 'very', 'high', 'note', 'just', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'seasons', 'come', 'follow', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'season', '9', 'do', ""n't"", 'envy', 'having', '9', 'seasons', 'ahead']",N/A

I enjoy the idea of using modern technology to solve old crimes that have sat unsolved because that very technology wasn't available. I also like how there is a theme present in the unsolved murder that relates back to issues in the lives of the team. It is dark, and it's filmed in low light in an office that feels like it's underground. Many of the episodes uncover some devious acts committed by now high-ranking police officials who create road blocks to prevent the team from being successful and taking them down. There's always a psychological aspect and a picture of the perpetrator comes to light. It's highly enjoyable if a little gruesome too.",5,"Modern forensics, old crimes",1401753600,"06 3, 2014",2014,753,"['love', 'waking', 'dead', 'series', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'miss', 'old', 'characters', 'Frankie', 'enjoy', 'idea', 'using', 'modern', 'technology', 'solve', 'old', 'crimes', 'have', 'sat', 'unsolved', 'very', 'technology', 'was', ""n't"", 'available', 'also', 'how', 'theme', 'present', 'unsolved', 'murder', 'back', 'issues', 'lives', 'team', 'dark', 'filmed', 'low', 'light', 'office', 'underground', 'Many', 'episodes', 'devious', 'acts', 'committed', 'now', 'high-ranking', 'police', 'officials', 'who', 'create', 'road', 'blocks', 'prevent', 'team', 'being', 'successful', 'taking', 'down', 'always', 'psychological', 'aspect', 'picture', 'perpetrator', 'light', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'little', 'gruesome', 'too']",N/A

I would recommend that you start with Season 1 so you can see the characters grow - several have left and been replaced with new ones but on occasion there are still references to them. This is a British show so the actors may not be familiar to you but they are excellent and it doesn't take long for you to feel like you know them. The writing is quick and sharp. The episodes start like Cold Case you see the crime and then go to the present and the squad starts to investigate. Give it a try - if you like British tv drama you will certainly enjoy this one.
