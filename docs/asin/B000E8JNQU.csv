For me, this one is the shining star and deserved the big budget film treatment given to ""Travels,"" which did not go over with me.  Both were ""knock yourself out"" parts with an over-the-top type of woman.  Again, there is such a notable difference in Ms. Smith's portrayals.  In this one, she definitely exhibits the energy, but successfully I thought.  In ""Travels,"" the aplomb was a bomb.  I was actually embarrassed for her.  It was an era of wacky and outlandish characters and doings with, again, at least one high energy character.  For me, this production carried it off without chewing up the scenery.  Definitely interested in revisits here, but nevermore for the annoying ""Travels,"" Ms. Smith's painful parts included.  However, that one is a rare exception for the wonderfully versatile and capable star performer.  [Note: ""Millionairess"" is worth it just for the dual fur flaps in the face at the beginning.

George Bernard Shaw.  This movie was done (poorly) with Sophia Loren andPeter Sellers...but I adored the play with Maggie Smith.  Oh...how she dominates her role.  At once, we understand how magnificent a star she is.  She plays the richest woman in England who is obsessed with getting what she wants, and having the cash to do it.  She is beautiful and arrogant yet brilliant in the ways of capitalism.  When she is given the challenge ofgetting a job and supporting herself without her wealth, well,she can do it because she understands money.  Indeed she walks into businesses and transforms them into profitable enterprises. Whether the impact of her changes hurts the poor or middle class is of no concern to her...profitability is the key.
