468860,AP2KQMSDOISO8,6305538395,highway_star,"[6, 7]","This is one of those werewolf films that's more comedy than anything else. Leslie, (Susan Blakley) gets bitten by pet store owner Harry (John Saxon) who is in need of a wife to keep the werewolf legacy alive. Leslie's daughter Jennifer (Katrina Caspary) follows her mother to the pet store (thinking she's having an affair with another man) and watches thru a backdoor window as Harry seduces and bites her mother. Jennifer then turns to her best friend Stacey (who's a monster comic fanatic) and Madame Gypsy (Ruth Buzzi)to help rid her mother of this curse. Leslie begins to grow fangs and sees more hair than usual on her arms and legs and things get pretty &quot;hairy&quot; after awhile. Jennifer's Halloween party is a riot with Leslie covered in long hair, fangs, etc. while all along the party goers think she's made up for Halloween. Finally, seeing as though holy water, crosses and garlic don't work on the werewolf, a knife made of silver does the trick in an all out fight between daughter, mother and werewolf in the bedroom. Saxon is stabbed by the silver knife and Leslie is rid of the curse. Again, this is a funny movie and even kids will enjoy it.",4,A Werewolf Movie That Will Have You Laughing!,1040860800,"12 26, 2002",2002,1166,"['one', 'werewolf', 'films', 'more', 'comedy', 'anything', 'else', 'Leslie', 'Susan', 'Blakley', 'bitten', 'pet', 'store', 'owner', 'Harry', 'John', 'Saxon', 'who', 'need', 'wife', 'keep', 'werewolf', 'legacy', 'alive', 'Leslie', 'daughter', 'Jennifer', 'Katrina', 'Caspary', 'mother', 'pet', 'store', 'thinking', 'having', 'affair', 'man', 'thru', 'backdoor', 'window', 'Harry', 'seduces', 'mother', 'Jennifer', 'then', 'best', 'friend', 'Stacey', 'who', 'monster', 'comic', 'fanatic', 'Madame', 'Gypsy', 'Ruth', 'Buzzi', 'help', 'rid', 'mother', 'curse', 'Leslie', 'grow', 'fangs', 'more', 'hair', 'usual', 'arms', 'legs', 'things', 'get', 'pretty', 'quot', 'hairy', 'quot', 'awhile', 'Jennifer', 'Halloween', 'party', 'riot', 'Leslie', 'covered', 'long', 'hair', 'fangs', 'etc', 'party', 'goers', 'think', 'made', 'up', 'Halloween', 'Finally', 'seeing', 'holy', 'water', 'crosses', 'garlic', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'werewolf', 'knife', 'made', 'silver', 'trick', 'out', 'fight', 'daughter', 'mother', 'werewolf', 'bedroom', 'Saxon', 'stabbed', 'silver', 'knife', 'Leslie', 'rid', 'curse', 'Again', 'funny', 'movie', 'even', 'kids', 'will', 'enjoy']",My Mom's a Werewolf
468861,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6305538395,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 1]","&quot;My Mom's a Werewolf&quot; is one of those films where you think somebody came up with the title and they were into production before there was actually a script.  The 1989 film is not an offensive horror comedy, but it is not especially good.  Susan Blakely, thirteen years after she was the female lead on &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man,&quot; plays Leslie Shaber, a typical suburban houseful who is pretty much ignored by her less than loving family.  Then one day she goes out to buy a new collar for the family dog but ends up in bed with Harry Thropen (John Saxon), a weird guy (I mentioned John Saxon played him, right?) who owns a pet shop.  During their little romp Harry bits Leslie on the toe...Now, stop for a moment and try to anticipate where this story is going.  If you are thinking anything along the lines of &quot;Teen Wolf,&quot; or a comparable horror comedy where being a monster turns out to be a good thing, this is not what writer Mark Pirro and director Michael Fischa come up with for their little film.  Leslie's daughter Jennifer (Katrina Caspary), finds out mom's little secret when the hair, the fangs, and the craving for raw meat becomes rather obvious.  But it turns out the transformation is not yet complete and Jennifer tries to save her mom from having to go live happily ever after with good old Harry (Harry, get it?  The werewolf's name is &quot;Harry&quot;).At least &quot;My Mom's a Werewolf&quot; acknowledges that it is going for the yucks.  All of the characters are overblown stereotypes and at one point it dawned on me that if this film had been made a decade later it might have been a direct to MST3K film.  In addition to Blakely the cast as John Schuck (&quot;MacMillan and Wife&quot;) as the husband, Ruth Buzzi (&quot;Laugh-In&quot;) as Madame Gypsy, and Marcia Wallace (&quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;) as Peggy, all of whom are other former familiar faces from television who have to be wondering what happened to their careers.  Actually, Blakely's performance is the best of the bunch and there is something rather sad that this particular injury is added to the insult of her home life.",3,Poor neglected housewife Susan Blakely becomes a werewolf,1067558400,"10 31, 2003",2003,2146,"['quot', 'My', 'Mom', 'Werewolf', 'quot', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'think', 'somebody', 'came', 'up', 'title', 'were', 'production', 'was', 'actually', 'script', '1989', 'film', 'not', 'offensive', 'horror', 'comedy', 'not', 'especially', 'good', 'Susan', 'Blakely', 'thirteen', 'years', 'was', 'female', 'lead', 'quot', 'Rich', 'Man', 'Poor', 'Man', 'quot', 'Leslie', 'Shaber', 'typical', 'suburban', 'houseful', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'ignored', 'less', 'loving', 'family', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'buy', 'new', 'collar', 'family', 'dog', 'up', 'bed', 'Harry', 'Thropen', 'John', 'Saxon', 'weird', 'guy', 'mentioned', 'John', 'Saxon', 'played', 'right', 'who', 'pet', 'shop', 'little', 'romp', 'Harry', 'Leslie', 'toe', 'Now', 'stop', 'moment', 'try', 'anticipate', 'where', 'story', 'going', 'are', 'thinking', 'anything', 'lines', 'quot', 'Teen', 'Wolf', 'quot', 'comparable', 'horror', 'comedy', 'where', 'being', 'monster', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'not', 'what', 'writer', 'Mark', 'Pirro', 'director', 'Michael', 'Fischa', 'come', 'up', 'little', 'film', 'Leslie', 'daughter', 'Jennifer', 'Katrina', 'Caspary', 'out', 'mom', 'little', 'secret', 'when', 'hair', 'fangs', 'craving', 'raw', 'meat', 'rather', 'obvious', 'out', 'transformation', 'not', 'yet', 'complete', 'Jennifer', 'save', 'mom', 'having', 'go', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'good', 'old', 'Harry', 'Harry', 'get', 'werewolf', 'name', 'quot', 'Harry', 'quot', 'least', 'quot', 'My', 'Mom', 'Werewolf', 'quot', 'going', 'yucks', 'characters', 'are', 'overblown', 'stereotypes', 'one', 'point', 'dawned', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'decade', 'later', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'direct', 'MST3K', 'film', 'addition', 'Blakely', 'cast', 'John', 'Schuck', 'quot', 'MacMillan', 'Wife', 'quot', 'husband', 'Ruth', 'Buzzi', 'quot', 'Laugh-In', 'quot', 'Madame', 'Gypsy', 'Marcia', 'Wallace', 'quot', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'Show', 'quot', 'Peggy', 'whom', 'are', 'other', 'former', 'familiar', 'television', 'who', 'have', 'be', 'wondering', 'what', 'happened', 'careers', 'Actually', 'Blakely', 'performance', 'best', 'bunch', 'something', 'rather', 'sad', 'particular', 'injury', 'added', 'insult', 'home', 'life']",My Mom's a Werewolf
