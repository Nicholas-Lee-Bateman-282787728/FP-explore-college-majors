Silent Night, Deadly Night 3 I actually really enjoyed, a blind girl is being stalked by a lobotomized killer she was psychically linked to while he was in a coma, file under trashy fun. I haven't watched Repossessed yet, having caught some of it on cable in the past I'm in no rush, but the other 3 are worthwhile flicks and make a nice addition to my collection.",4,Great Set,1304380800,"05 3, 2011",2011,774,"['love', 'getting', '4', 'movies', 'price', '1', 'especially', 'set', 'movies', 'would', 'have', 'bought', 'separately', 'anyway', 'one', 'sets', 'Slaughter', 'High', 'classic', '80', 'revenge', 'slasher', 'My', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Vampire', 'really', 'fun', '80', 'fish', 'water', 'flick', 'teenager', 'who', 'adjust', 'learn', 'ways', 'modern', 'Vampire', 'being', 'bitten', 'one', 'help', '300', 'year', 'old', 'mentor', 'Silent', 'Night', 'Deadly', 'Night', '3', 'actually', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'blind', 'girl', 'being', 'stalked', 'lobotomized', 'killer', 'was', 'psychically', 'linked', 'was', 'coma', 'file', 'trashy', 'fun', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'Repossessed', 'yet', 'having', 'caught', 'cable', 'past', ""'m"", 'rush', 'other', '3', 'are', 'worthwhile', 'flicks', 'make', 'nice', 'addition', 'collection']",N/A

I LOVE the first, My Best Friend Is a Vampire.  Very reminiscent of ALL of those teen horror/comedy films.  Repossessed is okay, I gave it a three because of many talents in it -- Though it clarified why Linda Blair hasn't been in many successful films.  It's a rip at Exorcist, and I might add a sad one at that.  Slaughter High was a film I hadn't seen before.  I liked it, but, that is about all.  Caution though, it has both male and female (FF) nudity.  I kept waiting for it to surprises me and the surprise was IONO what happened.  LOL  All of them but Silent Night, Deadly Night 3 has subtitles in English for the deaf.  I don't know why one isn't or at least captioned but it is annoying at least.",4,A Vampire Walks Into A Bar...,1389139200,"01 8, 2014",2014,796,"['Well', 'got', 'attention', 'did', ""n't"", 'are', 'fun', 'mostly', 'semi-spook-silly', 'LOVE', 'first', 'My', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Vampire', 'Very', 'reminiscent', 'ALL', 'teen', 'horror/comedy', 'films', 'Repossessed', 'okay', 'gave', 'three', 'many', 'talents', 'clarified', 'why', 'Linda', 'Blair', ""n't"", 'been', 'many', 'successful', 'films', 'rip', 'Exorcist', 'might', 'add', 'sad', 'one', 'Slaughter', 'High', 'was', 'film', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'liked', 'Caution', 'male', 'female', 'FF', 'nudity', 'kept', 'waiting', 'surprises', 'surprise', 'was', 'IONO', 'what', 'happened', 'LOL', 'All', 'Silent', 'Night', 'Deadly', 'Night', '3', 'subtitles', 'English', 'deaf', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'one', ""n't"", 'least', 'captioned', 'annoying', 'least']",N/A
