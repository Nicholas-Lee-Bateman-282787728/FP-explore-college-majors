Stunning as monster movie adventure, the film is mostly a campy and satirical trek through a biological disaster of epic proportions.  Drawing from the recent SARS scare, the film reflects on the repercussions of the clampdown taken to eradicate the disease while keeping the victims under a martial law type quarantine.It all begins in a lab where a young subordinate is working with his older superior.  Noting the bottles of toxins are gathering dust, the elder orders the young man to empty the contents of the lethal substances down the drain.  While many of us would at least try to go over his head, we're not supposed to take it that far as the younger scientist objects to the procedural effects on the Han River.  The narrative then turns to a snack shop owner, Park Hee-bong (Byun Hee bong),  whose daughter, Nam-joo, is an archery champion and a son who is asleep at the counter during his absence.The events that transpire are a real awakening.  Down at the Han River, a mutant cocoon figure hangs by a bridge. People by the riverbank watch in horror as the mass comes to life.  Amphibious by nature (although most descriptions favor a scaly reptilian presence) the monster comes to shore and wreaks havoc throughout the land.  Panic ensues, and the monster either devours or captures its victims.  Tragically, it takes the snack bar owner's granddaughter to a sewer and keeps her captive in its lair.  The fast motion of film skillfully captures the victims in view of the monster as he hunts them down, but the silky smooth slow motion shots also resonate the key moments when the innocent are in peril.From here the narrative lightens up.  We have loopy scenes where those tainted by the monster have acquired a mysterious disease are treated like villains rather than victims.  Newsclips show how the South Korean and American governments clamp down on the affliction like a military conquest.  Becoming fugitives in exile, the family tries to escape quarantine and rescue the girl from the monster's clutches.Distinctive and unique, 'The Host' is thoroughly thought-provoking entertainment, even if it sometimes hits its satiric notes too long and too often.",4,Infectious Satirical Spoof,1185753600,"07 30, 2007",2007,2266,"['3', '1/2', '*', 'South', 'Korea', 'Host', 'long', 'way', 'old', 'Godzilla', 'pictures', 'Stunning', 'monster', 'movie', 'adventure', 'film', 'mostly', 'campy', 'satirical', 'trek', 'biological', 'disaster', 'epic', 'proportions', 'Drawing', 'recent', 'SARS', 'scare', 'film', 'repercussions', 'clampdown', 'taken', 'eradicate', 'disease', 'keeping', 'victims', 'martial', 'law', 'type', 'quarantine.It', 'begins', 'lab', 'where', 'young', 'subordinate', 'working', 'older', 'superior', 'Noting', 'bottles', 'toxins', 'are', 'gathering', 'dust', 'elder', 'orders', 'young', 'man', 'empty', 'contents', 'lethal', 'down', 'drain', 'many', 'would', 'least', 'try', 'go', 'over', 'head', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'take', 'far', 'younger', 'scientist', 'objects', 'procedural', 'effects', 'Han', 'River', 'narrative', 'then', 'snack', 'shop', 'owner', 'Park', 'Hee-bong', 'Byun', 'Hee', 'bong', 'daughter', 'Nam-joo', 'archery', 'champion', 'son', 'who', 'asleep', 'counter', 'absence.The', 'events', 'transpire', 'are', 'real', 'awakening', 'Down', 'Han', 'River', 'mutant', 'cocoon', 'figure', 'hangs', 'bridge', 'People', 'riverbank', 'watch', 'horror', 'mass', 'life', 'Amphibious', 'nature', 'most', 'descriptions', 'favor', 'scaly', 'reptilian', 'presence', 'monster', 'shore', 'wreaks', 'havoc', 'land', 'Panic', 'ensues', 'monster', 'devours', 'victims', 'Tragically', 'snack', 'bar', 'owner', 'granddaughter', 'sewer', 'captive', 'lair', 'fast', 'motion', 'film', 'skillfully', 'victims', 'view', 'monster', 'down', 'silky', 'smooth', 'slow', 'motion', 'shots', 'also', 'resonate', 'key', 'moments', 'when', 'innocent', 'are', 'peril.From', 'here', 'narrative', 'up', 'have', 'loopy', 'scenes', 'where', 'tainted', 'monster', 'have', 'acquired', 'mysterious', 'disease', 'are', 'treated', 'villains', 'rather', 'victims', 'Newsclips', 'show', 'how', 'South', 'Korean', 'American', 'governments', 'clamp', 'down', 'affliction', 'military', 'conquest', 'Becoming', 'fugitives', 'exile', 'family', 'escape', 'quarantine', 'rescue', 'girl', 'monster', 'clutches.Distinctive', 'unique', 'Host', 'thoroughly', 'thought-provoking', 'entertainment', 'even', 'satiric', 'notes', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'often']",N/A

Unfortunately I'd have to disagree with some of the critical acclaim on the box because this film is not at par with Jaws, and it certainly isn't scary. It is worth a look, but don't expect the greatest monster movie you'll ever see.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The story begins in a morgue where two morticians are getting rid of dangerous chemicals by pouring them down the sink, where the contents went into the Han River. It takes the B-movie approach by having a dangerous creature morph into an abomination because of these chemicals. Then one day onlookers stare at a strange creature that is holding onto the bridge. It then jumps into the river, swims to shore, and then begins attacking people on the shore and eating them. When a girl gets taken by the monster, her family is determined to find her and kill the creature that the government claims the host of some kind of mysterious virus.MUSIC: The score is excellent and superbly crafted, one of the best parts of the movie.STORY: The story is uneven and riddled with holes and displays an overall sloppy presentation (Not to mention the awful ending). The lowest point of the entire film. Plus, there are some parts you can't take seriously because they are cheesy. This film's comedic humor manages to save some parts of the story but feel out of place.ENTERTAINMENT: It all depends on how much like monster movies, you can like and you can hate it. It all depends on your preferences of films. I found it to be good, but flawed because of the storyline. This film will not scare you.OVERALL: It's good, but flawed because of a sloppy story. But the great music, atmosphere, certain creature scenes, and a few extras keep things moving.THE GOOD: Cool monster, great music, cool scenes, funny humor.THE BAD: Sloppy story, some cheesy scenes, don't ever watch this in the English language; it's painful put on Korean and insert English subtitles.",4,"GOOD OVERALL, BUT THE STORY IS FULL OF HOLES  8 OUT OF 10",1215907200,"07 13, 2008",2008,2005,"['Host', 'not', 'best', 'monster', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'good', 'times', 'really', 'mixed', 'bag', 'film', 'Unfortunately', ""'d"", 'have', 'disagree', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'box', 'film', 'not', 'par', 'Jaws', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'scary', 'look', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'greatest', 'monster', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see.WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'story', 'morgue', 'where', 'two', 'morticians', 'are', 'getting', 'rid', 'dangerous', 'chemicals', 'pouring', 'down', 'sink', 'where', 'contents', 'went', 'Han', 'River', 'B-movie', 'approach', 'having', 'dangerous', 'creature', 'morph', 'abomination', 'chemicals', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'onlookers', 'stare', 'strange', 'creature', 'holding', 'bridge', 'then', 'river', 'shore', 'then', 'attacking', 'people', 'shore', 'eating', 'When', 'girl', 'taken', 'monster', 'family', 'determined', 'find', 'kill', 'creature', 'government', 'host', 'kind', 'mysterious', 'virus.MUSIC', 'score', 'excellent', 'superbly', 'crafted', 'one', 'best', 'parts', 'movie.STORY', 'story', 'uneven', 'riddled', 'holes', 'displays', 'overall', 'sloppy', 'presentation', 'Not', 'mention', 'awful', 'ending', 'lowest', 'point', 'entire', 'film', 'are', 'parts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'are', 'cheesy', 'film', 'comedic', 'humor', 'manages', 'save', 'parts', 'story', 'feel', 'place.ENTERTAINMENT', 'how', 'much', 'monster', 'movies', 'can', 'like', 'can', 'hate', 'preferences', 'films', 'found', 'be', 'good', 'flawed', 'storyline', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'scare', 'you.OVERALL', 'good', 'flawed', 'sloppy', 'story', 'great', 'music', 'atmosphere', 'certain', 'creature', 'scenes', 'few', 'extras', 'keep', 'things', 'moving.THE', 'GOOD', 'Cool', 'monster', 'great', 'music', 'cool', 'scenes', 'funny', 'humor.THE', 'BAD', 'Sloppy', 'story', 'cheesy', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'watch', 'English', 'language', 'painful', 'put', 'Korean', 'insert', 'English', 'subtitles']",N/A

Therefore, we can provide the following tips to those who aspire to make a critically-acclaimed monster movie:1. Sideline the actual monster, which incidentally looks pretty good in Host (at least from a distance) in favour of a nasty, paranoid government-is-after-us thriller plot.2. Have as central protagonists a bizarre and unsympathetically idiotic family who are poorly characterised and resemble hackneyed archetypes.3. Make sure everybody other than the protagonists is either actively despicable or callously uncaring.4.  Include an excessive amount of, often embarrassingly unsuccessful, slapstick comedy sequences.5. Lace the film with absurd anti-American themes and subplots.It's also probably better that you don't have too much in the way of narrative structure or suspense--that would be all too ""Hollywood"".For those who prefer their monster films a little more engaging and a little less aggressively middle-brow, I would recommend steering clear of this entirely.

1071938,A1PY6SJT8UHL92,B000PKG8SS,Amazon Customer,"[4, 8]","This is a good ""monster"" movie, among the best in the genre, and quite different from, say, both Jaws or Alien. The former was much more ""serious"" and way less humorous, while the latter was immensely darker and scarier. The monster, here, is some sort of mutated amphibian who finds out that feeding on men is relatively easy and convenient.The movie centers around the story of a family who defies the immense stupidity and obtuseness of government, public health and military to do what they can to free a young daughter from the monster den. I ended up caring a lot for all members of this family, which is something that virtually never happens in this kind of movie.The Host is, mostly, NOT very scary at all, but in a way that makes it more ""credible"" and more interesting. The acting is good (once you take into account that people in Korea, as in Japan, in real life, do not express emotion as we do), and if you have the good sense of turning off the horrible dubbing and listen to the original Korean version of the movie. I found the special effects quite convincing, ESPECIALLY because the monster appears to be in some way clumsy and confused itself, which is a nice change with respect to most movies where the monster is a perfect killing machine. What is indeed interesting is that the monster itself seems to be on a learning curve throughout the movie. At the beginning, it just happen to reach the section of the Han River running through the city, and it just hangs below a bridge. His first attack is in daylight, and the monster seems at times as confused as the bystanders when he starts his feeding frenzy. The people's reactions too are fairly credible, with lots of people simply running away, and a few more courageous individuals trying to attack the thing with what they can. My guess is that if this sort of monster appeared in the Hudson river, this is how people would react in NY. Someone at first taking pictures with their cell phones, some other then realizing there's something wrong, with chaos ensuing and then some folks reacting. The movie is also often purposely comical, and I personally would have been happier without that, because then the mood would have been darker, and maybe more appropriate.

(E.g., evil American coroner forces protesting Korean assistant to dump numerous bottles of formaldehyde down drain and into river because bottles are covered with dust. This causes a really ugly mutation of some innocent salamander or some such. No kidding, that's how it starts.) This has always been amazing to me given that the U.S. is the only thing that has kept the over-armed nut who runs their northern neighbor from making South Korea a nice little add-on and its citizens a whole lot less happy than they are now.Nevertheless, it is a darned good special effects monster movie, easilly the equal in cgi of the last Godzilla movie. Beyond the special effects, which are displayed early in the film and fequently, the story line of a quite disfunctional family who's little girl is taken by the monster is sometimes funny, often hard to comprehend, and really drags at times. there is a goodly amount of bad acting by the secondary players combined with bad writing. I cut the main Korean characters some slack in this regard as I am not sure that what I'd consider occasional over-acting on their parts is not just how people under stress behave in S.

All these elements were successfully incorporated in the film and that was what made it interesting to me.The buildup is slow but then you have the finest destruction scene in recent years. I gave this scene a high mark because the monster does not get to topple any famous landmarks instead it rushes after people and you get to observe the emotions which are a combination of fear and helplessness on their faces in this chaos.  The news breaks to the media and the military is called to help provide medical care and then quarantine the citizens. You have the introduction to the characters who will be protagonists, a child like adult (Song Kang Ho ) his sister who is a archer, and brother who is educated but unemployed.

The cinematography is amazing, especially those crystal clear close ups that feel so glossed yet so dirty at the same time.  The score is marvelous, and really finds so much color and texture in so many different moments of the film.  The plot and actual pacing and the way that themes are presented with semi-originality is also a blessing.  But then there are let downs.  The acting as a whole is over the top, and not in a good way.  The film also suffers from lack of true focus in the thematic elements, getting serious then campy then serious and failing to blend the two in a way that feels complete.  I also found the graphics to be somewhat cheap and on the verge of `Sci-Fi Network' feeling, until the end where they miraculously felt more grounded and lived in.  That said, for what it promises to be (a monster movie), `The Host' delivers for the most part.  It is fun and it has so many rich elements at play here.  I wish it had been better, and it is nowhere near the creative splendor of some films it is attempting to compare itself to (seriously, `Jaws'...like, you're kidding right?) but it does offer something.

I realize you can find anyone to hype even the worst of movies, but this is borderline libel in my opinion.I have learned that some of the movies that you never hear of until you see them on DVD, that have rave reviews on the case, are actually pretty good, often much better than the box office hits. I repeat, ""some"" of the movies.The plot was fine, the visual effects were very good, some of the scenes were pretty intense and dramatic, but the movie still flops badly in my opinion because of plain stupidity. And no, I do not mean the absurdity of a monster living in the river that eats people, it is a monster movie after all so I have no problem with that, rather I mean the goofiness of some of the characters, and the absolutely mind-numbing dialogue.Obviously the dialogue had to be dubbed in, and I understand that presents many problems, unfortunately they were either unable to overcome these problems, or the writing was juvenile.I suppose that ""campy"" is how the fans of this movie want to describe it, but I don't agree. The stupidity in this movie is so strong it destroys what could have been a decent movie, and at times it is actually hard to watch. Some of the attempts at humor were unbelievably pathetic. They were either poorly timed, poorly executed, or again, just stupid.The ""dad"" (or ""blondie"") annoyed me from the moment the movie started. Weird. My biggest disappointment was that ""dad"" was not attacked and killed by the monster at a very early point in the movie. I am perfectly sincere when I say that this would have made this a much better movie. My 2nd biggest disappointment was that he was not attacked and killed by the monster late in the movie, which would at least have given this movie a happy ending.2 stars because of plot, some good scenes, and visual effects.

On the one hand, it's the story of a giant, lightning-quick, intelligent, and ferocious sea monster, and the idea of puny humans waging war against it is like imagining my hamsters ganging up and challenging me through use of superior technology.  On the other hand, there are moments of realism portrayed like no horror movie I've seen before: the characters are quite well developed (no bubble-headed damsels in distress here- people react to the creature antagonist in a panicked, realistic way); there are many dramatic moments where the action sequences are wisely held in abeyance; emotional pain is both generously doled out and tenderly communicated; and the ending doesn't tie things up neatly in a rosy package.  There is a lot of surprising humor, too; I laughed out loud during The Host more than I have for most comedies lately.It's a busy little picture, to be sure, and I'm afraid it bit off more than it could chew.  There are conspiracies afoot aplenty.  All kinds of nefarious characters surface to thwart protagonist Gang-du's efforts, whose identities, backers, and motives are never revealed.  City-wide protests serve as a confusing backdrop, and aren't well explained or supported.  I recognize they're symbolic (as are many of The Host's more extraneous elements), but couldn't' really be bothered expending much grey matter deciphering the metaphors.I read an astute summation of this movie as ""the weak protecting the weaker.""  Gang-du is an unwilling player in this survival game, and springs into action only upon realization that he's among the last few people capable of rescuing his loved ones and other innocents.

When the monster strikes the Wonhyogyo riverbank and captures a young girl, it is up to her family to band together and come to her rescue. While it appears to be a monster movie on the surface, THE HOST is a touching family drama at heart that is filled with plenty of fun characters and light humor. The Park family is by no means perfect, but they must each put their differences aside in order to save their courageous daughter Hyun-Seo. Director Bong Joon-Ho takes a far different approach to the monster movie and opens with an incredible attack sequence that is beautifully shot and choreographed, revealing the monster to the audience very early on. From here, the beast becomes a background player that is simply a catalyst for the family's struggle. Also unlike most traditional Japanese monster movies, the slimy creature is rendered entirely by computer, but its sleek design and interactions with the surrounding environments give it a life of its own. Bong infuses the plot with a strong sense of satire and biting social commentary as well, but in a way that is both relevant and entertaining at the same time.

It depicts the strong bond between family members. It's so powerful that everybody was willing to sacrifice himself/herself  to save the other. In the film, you can see the grandfather, the aunt and other people did everything they could, including risking their lives to save the young girl from the monster. You will also see the father asking other members to love his brother who was intellectually underdeveloped. He said something approximately like this ""Love him for who he is. Do not make fun of him"".If your family already had a member with terminal disease or disabilities of any kind, you'll feel related to this movie. It will reminds you how heart-wrenching it was to watch your loved one dying even though everybody had tried everything.

It was a box office smash in its home country of South Korea and is doing great business here in the states in its limited release so it has obviously struck something of a chord. The cynic in me says that it has everything to do with its close proximity, style wise, to Hollywood. It looks and acts like a run of the mill ""War of the Worlds"" wannabe. So now Koreans can see a special effects bonanza made specifically for them and the art house snobs here can sneak away to their independent cinemas and enjoy a guilt free B movie. Not that this is a bad movie, don't misunderstand me. There is a ton to love here.  It is just that the truly awesome scenes that live within this picture are scattered widely throughout the two hours, and the downtime between them really sucks the life out of you. The absolute best scene happens early on and it involves our first glimpse at this toxic created monster who emerges from the sea. It wreaks havoc all through the surrounding area with special effects that look so good they would even impress my dad. The scene is refreshingly light on its feet and focused on fun. But for every perfectly executed scene like that there are three to four that feel off and unnecessary. Plus, at least for me, once the CGI contact high wears off your interest will begin to wean.Not content to just proclaim this monsters existence, Bong Joon-ho points his blame right here at us Americans. The dirty deed involves one of those useless meatheaded military types, American of course, forcing a man to pour dirty chemicals down the drain. Later, when those dirty chemicals are all grown up and living in the form of a giant reptilian beast (I will leave the description of its mouth to the grad students) the US is there to spread lies, paranoia, and martial law. Then, finally, when all is said and done our government, which we are so loyal to, blames the Koreans for the whole thing. The plot centers around a misfit family group who are looking for their 7th grade relative who was snatched up by the monster and placed in a sewer somewhere. Her dad is overtly incompetent, falling asleep on the job, allowing her to get abducted, turning the family in to the virus phobic government. Will dear old bum of a dad be redeemed by slaying something evil? Take your best guess. Lots of the film takes place in the sewers of Korea as they hunt for the little girl, and quite honestly this is some pretty ho hum stuff. Joon-ho seems much more adept at filming American style spectacles as opposed to the more domestic family situations. Not that I can complain, there is probably enough visceral monster mayhem here to keep all you philistines happy. Plus there is oodles of humor that can best be described as physical irony that takes place in the theater of the absurd. Just that it goes on for way too long and by the end starts to feel. . .Asian. How you make a horror movie that starts off this enjoyable fall asleep is beyond me but somehow here it has been pulled off. ***",3,Creature Feature From The Far East,1180742400,"06 2, 2007",2007,3218,"['having', 'one', 'best', 'looking', 'movie', 'monsters', 'ever', 'found', 'Hollywood', 'having', 'strong', 'political', 'message', 'something', 'missing', 'Host', 'being', 'wholly', 'worthwhile', 'was', 'box', 'office', 'smash', 'home', 'country', 'South', 'Korea', 'doing', 'great', 'business', 'here', 'states', 'limited', 'release', 'obviously', 'struck', 'something', 'chord', 'cynic', 'everything', 'do', 'close', 'proximity', 'style', 'wise', 'Hollywood', 'run', 'mill', 'War', 'Worlds', 'wannabe', 'So', 'now', 'Koreans', 'can', 'see', 'special', 'effects', 'bonanza', 'made', 'specifically', 'art', 'house', 'snobs', 'here', 'can', 'sneak', 'away', 'independent', 'cinemas', 'enjoy', 'guilt', 'free', 'B', 'movie', 'Not', 'bad', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'misunderstand', 'ton', 'love', 'here', 'just', 'truly', 'awesome', 'scenes', 'live', 'picture', 'are', 'scattered', 'widely', 'two', 'hours', 'downtime', 'really', 'life', 'absolute', 'best', 'scene', 'early', 'first', 'glimpse', 'toxic', 'created', 'monster', 'who', 'sea', 'havoc', 'surrounding', 'area', 'special', 'effects', 'look', 'so', 'good', 'would', 'even', 'impress', 'dad', 'scene', 'refreshingly', 'light', 'feet', 'focused', 'fun', 'perfectly', 'executed', 'scene', 'are', 'three', 'four', 'feel', 'off', 'unnecessary', 'least', 'once', 'CGI', 'contact', 'high', 'wears', 'interest', 'will', 'begin', 'wean.Not', 'content', 'just', 'proclaim', 'monsters', 'existence', 'Bong', 'Joon-ho', 'points', 'blame', 'right', 'here', 'Americans', 'dirty', 'deed', 'one', 'useless', 'meatheaded', 'military', 'types', 'American', 'course', 'forcing', 'man', 'pour', 'dirty', 'chemicals', 'down', 'drain', 'Later', 'when', 'dirty', 'chemicals', 'are', 'grown', 'up', 'living', 'form', 'giant', 'reptilian', 'beast', 'will', 'leave', 'description', 'mouth', 'grad', 'students', 'US', 'there', 'spread', 'lies', 'paranoia', 'martial', 'law', 'Then', 'finally', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'government', 'are', 'so', 'loyal', 'Koreans', 'whole', 'thing', 'plot', 'centers', 'misfit', 'family', 'group', 'who', 'are', 'looking', '7th', 'grade', 'relative', 'who', 'was', 'snatched', 'up', 'monster', 'placed', 'sewer', 'somewhere', 'dad', 'overtly', 'incompetent', 'falling', 'asleep', 'job', 'allowing', 'get', 'abducted', 'turning', 'family', 'virus', 'phobic', 'government', 'Will', 'dear', 'old', 'bum', 'dad', 'be', 'redeemed', 'slaying', 'something', 'evil', 'Take', 'best', 'guess', 'Lots', 'film', 'place', 'sewers', 'Korea', 'hunt', 'little', 'girl', 'quite', 'honestly', 'pretty', 'ho', 'hum', 'stuff', 'Joon-ho', 'much', 'more', 'adept', 'filming', 'American', 'style', 'spectacles', 'opposed', 'more', 'domestic', 'family', 'situations', 'Not', 'can', 'complain', 'probably', 'enough', 'visceral', 'monster', 'mayhem', 'here', 'keep', 'philistines', 'happy', 'oodles', 'humor', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'physical', 'irony', 'place', 'theater', 'absurd', 'Just', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'end', 'feel', '.Asian', 'How', 'make', 'horror', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'fall', 'asleep', 'somehow', 'here', 'been', 'pulled', 'off', '***']",N/A

A Korean flick about a monster that lives in a river and feasts on an unsuspecting Korean city? Sounds kind of cliched, right? Well, right in that sense but wrong in the sense that I underestimated this film.While the story-line and plot falter at times, I still found this to be a very entertaining and arousing film to my senses. If you can get over the cheesy American voice-overs for the Korean characters(and they are pretty lame at times), then you've pretty much gotten over the only true flaw of ""The Host"". The other flaw being the uninspired plot of an over-sized and ugly fish-like creature carrying off a family member to sea(or river, in this case), while the other family members take up a personnal vendetta against the creature and go searching for it with hardly enough weapons to last albeit one minute.Where the plot fails, the viuals and sound more than make up for it. The monster looks and sounds amazing! It is simply unreal what computers can do this day in age for movies. Very creepy and life-like looking creature. It really makes your skin crawl at times just imagining what you'd do if face to face with this monstrocity.While the films drags on at times, mainly in the middle of the film, it isn't all that bad. Just when you think you are about to lose interest, the monster comes right back into the picture and captivates you once again! And I also found that if you speak Korean, you will probably take this movie a little more seriously. I turned on the Korean language option for about five minutes and found that I could take this film and the characters alot more serious. The American voice-overs are laughable and rediculous compared to hearing this movie the way it was originally intended to be heard. In Korean!Overall, if you are into chilling monster flicks, ala King Kong, Jaws, Godzilla etc., this movie is definetly for you. Brilliantly directed and very solid performances from the cast make this a must-see film for fans who are itching for a decent horror movie. Where the story lacks, the creature and the suspense more than make up for it and will have you on the edge of your seat. Don't take this movie too serious though, as you could be disappointed.

Sure the idea of a mutated creature running rampant has been done before (The Relic, Mimic), the political messages and a more family-oriented tone rather than just out-and-out carnage but somehow the film successfully brings all of these together with a film that, yes, while being not completely original and it does have a few minor flaws, it still manages to entertain.Park Gang-Hu is a concession stand worker living near the Han River. There with his dad Hie-Bong and daughter Hyun-Seo, he gets quite the surprise one day when a mutated creature from the river arrives and rampages through the park, eating and kidnapping some of the people including Hyun-Seo. But misinformation and an overbearing government declares the creature biologically contagious and can infect others, including Gang-Hu, Hie-Bong, university student and Hyun-Seo's uncle Nam-Il and her auntie, archer Nam-Joo. They 4 of them have to try and escape the authorities and save Hyun-Seo who's being kept alive by the creature for a future meal.The film starts out with an incredibly memorable attack as the creature first makes its appearance. And like one reviewer said, you're sort of taken aback by just how quick it's seen onscreen. None of that Jaws or Alien stuff where it takes so long to see the creature, it just shows it in full-view dropping into the river then as its running towards camera. Also I find the creature to be well-animated and doesn't look like a hideous blob like the crocodile in Primeval. One complaint is that it does look a bit too texture-y and very noticeable but as a whole, the creature is well done.As for the rest of the film after the attack, it's also just as good although some might feel it doesn't have that pull the opening did. You get quite sympathetic for the family and hope that somehow, this odd-yet-functioning family finds the daughter but you almost wish the creature would pop up more since we can go literally 20 minutes without even seeing anything and you kind of wonder where it went and why it's not doing anything. It's fine to slow the pace down and chat but it's not as tension-filled as it should've been. But the tone is quite well done such as the humor that comes in or the handling of the governments and isn't as bothersome as one might think.Whether or not it's on par with Jaws or Alien shouldn't even be an issue since all 3 films succeed on different merits.

The tone is pitch-perfect, and surprisingly endearing...it is truly the family that makes this film shine; despite, yes, the best -classic, already- movie monster chaos since the original JPark came out.  It was certainly the best audience reaction I have seen at an event movie since JPark - people were cheering for the family, and going nuts at the scary parts.  And it IS scary - quite a bit.  Better than most, by a long shot.  Now...I am not one for humor in horror films...and going in knowing that the advertising campaign for this hit was aiming a bit for the comedy angle - the comedy in this film is fantastic.  It's a bit over the top - but not TOO, like some trailers suggest.  It's in small doses, is well done, and mainly it's to keep the focus and involvement with the family - and once you see the film, and are part of the charm of the actors for two hours, you understand the hype over the appeal of the characters.  They ARE us.  For a slacker who came out of the Grunge scene - I felt the lead actor was dead-on, and you connect with his despair.  As a matter of fact, all the actors are just perfect for their parts in The Host.  The warm moments are very genuine.  A very pleasant surprise - and just as important a reason to see this movie as The Host itself..!!  Everything you've heard is true - the monster is terrific.  The fact that the director had the monster show up in the first 15 minutes in broad daylight sets the bar for the rest of the film's manic action.  The beast is a mean one - and the monster itself just absolutely ROCKS.  I loved watching this scary creature!  The pure excitement that The Host infuses is remarkable.  These scenes are the best in the business, hands down.  Excitement, and adventure.  This is a 5 Star movie.  It is smart, honest and extremely well realized - it is not merely up to par with Hollywood movies...it surpasses Hollywood movies.  This one will be around for a long time.

This is a remarkably stylistic drama, which just happens to have a creature instead of a person as the antagonist.  I agree with a reviewer who warns not to watch the dubbed version... it takes a great deal of the quality away from the film. If you want to see this movie, get the subtitled original.  The basic story is about a creature that suddenly emerges from a river and terrorizes a town. But, the heart of the story is really about the people, and how they deal with this tragedy in their lives.  There is an intense scene at the beginning, even before the monster arrives, where a man stands on the bridge, overlooking the river, and upon seeing a dark patch in the water, he commits suicide, as if he knows what's coming... he even remarks to other men standing nearing him ""You don't see it?  You don't know?"" or something like that. The monster itself is very realistic, very high tech (cinematicly), and quite scary.  The heroes of the story turn out to be a father trying to save his daughter and a young girl who is a champion archer. The creature lives in the sewer drain of the river, and takes its victims there to feed... it captures people alive with its tail. There are two children who somehow got trapped down there with the creature, but manage to hide in smaller spaces where the creature can't go. The suspense and horror is well formatted in the scenes of the creature's lair, the reactions of the people, and the drama going on with the father who - along with others - is trying to destroy the creature and save his daughter, who has recently been taken by the creature.  The sequences with the creature are intense, but the real story is the people and their drama/tragedy. If you're expecting a monster movie, like Godzilla... this is not for you. It's more like a Shakespearean tragedy, but with a big lizard.

Here you are introduced to a small family with diverse personalities who have to come together and do whatever it takes to rescue their youngest when she's abducted by The Host.  Joon-Ho Bong shows his obvious directing chops and films the monster incredibly well with a sense of curiousity and awe rather than just sheer horror.

The family as I mentioned before, are all memorable and acted to perfection by a great cast (lead son Gang-Du is like a Korean Homer Simpson!).

It's a great monster.I've watched this film in both the English dub and the original Korean version with the English subtitles.  And while I agree that it makes all the difference hearing the actor's voice as opposed to mismatched English replacements, the subtitles are almost unreadable.  Unless they appear against a dark background, they cannot be seen to be read.The story moves quickly, it deals with a family's unshakable faith that their youngest member, taken by the creature, is still alive.  They set out against overwhelming odds to rescue her.  This oddball family is both humorous and heartrending in their devotion.  In addition to this, there's also some political observations included (based on real events involving a Korean mortician who dumped large quantities of formaldehyde down a drain).  In this film, Americans are not portrayed with any great affection.  Director Bong Joon-ho stated, ""It's a stretch to simplify The Host as an anti-American film, but there is certainly a metaphor and political commentary about the U.S.""  Regardless of whatever grudge the filmmakers have against America, this is still a good film worth watching (and having in one's collection).Supposedly, there is a prequel in the works and an American remake.",5,"""How many tails does that thing have?""",1391731200,"02 7, 2014",2014,1345,"['fabulous', 'looking', 'creature', ""n't"", 'appear', 'nearly', 'enough', 'scenes', 'suit', 'great', 'monster.I', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'film', 'English', 'dub', 'original', 'Korean', 'version', 'English', 'subtitles', 'agree', 'difference', 'hearing', 'actor', 'voice', 'opposed', 'mismatched', 'English', 'replacements', 'subtitles', 'are', 'almost', 'unreadable', 'appear', 'dark', 'background', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'read.The', 'story', 'moves', 'quickly', 'family', 'unshakable', 'faith', 'youngest', 'member', 'taken', 'creature', 'still', 'alive', 'set', 'out', 'overwhelming', 'odds', 'rescue', 'oddball', 'family', 'humorous', 'heartrending', 'devotion', 'addition', 'also', 'political', 'observations', 'included', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'involving', 'Korean', 'mortician', 'who', 'dumped', 'large', 'quantities', 'formaldehyde', 'down', 'drain', 'film', 'Americans', 'are', 'not', 'portrayed', 'great', 'affection', 'Director', 'Bong', 'Joon-ho', 'stated', 'stretch', 'simplify', 'Host', 'anti-American', 'film', 'certainly', 'metaphor', 'political', 'commentary', 'U.S.', 'Regardless', 'grudge', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'America', 'still', 'good', 'film', 'watching', 'having', 'one', 'collection', '.Supposedly', 'prequel', 'works', 'American', 'remake']",N/A

If you've already seen this film, you probably were nodding your head when you read my title (with a little luck, you giggled or snickered).  If you have not viewed this film before then you probably thought I was trying to be sublime.  Sorry about that.  I suppose the polite thing to do would be to explain;-COOL MONSTERThe monster is very interesting and well executed.  It is seamlessly integrated into the live action and very convincing visually.  Unlike many monster films, ""The Host"" does not have a monster theme song or warning; it usually appears when things are quiet.  In fact, the director did a good job of ""zoning-out"" the viewer when the monster appears.  Like in real life, when in a state of astonished shock, time slows down and everything gets numbingly quiet until we zone-in again.  On the downside, I thought that an aquatic mutation would not be quite as intelligent as this beast and it was just a little too indestructible for most of the film.  However, the overall execution was very effective.-SILLY PEOPLE.First of all, let me state that I am an American.  I've never been to Korea nor am I an expert on Korean culture (I know very little).  So I can't really judge how typical these characters were.  That said, most of them were just a little overblown and hammy.  There was no attempt at camp, its all played pretty straight so this was a problem.  Good performances to lookout for are the little school girl whom I enjoyed quite a bit, and her Grandfather who at least seamed genuine.  Most of the other main subjects were sort of caricatures rather than characters.  The American characters were scripted and acted just horribly and the obvious villains (even more so than the monster who is played as more of a consequence of the evil Americans than an evil unto itself).  There is one American hero type but he's not very effective.  I must admit enjoying the family dynamics of the featured characters even if I didn't like them and despite a little too much of them.-BRIDGES AND TRAILERSAgain, I know nothing of life around Seoul, Korea.  I have to assume there are lots of bridges and trailers based on this film.  It was definitely an interesting backdrop for a monster movie; particularly the bridges.  The bridges were used mostly as artistic graphic elements; employing triangulation, perspective and geometry to create visually stunning imagery.  I have to give credit for top notch cinematography in this film.  It was a visual treat and actually above the story and characters deployed.  The trailers were effective in that they provided very little sense of security, being what they are.  The bridges get 5 starts, the trailers 3.THE DVD-I bought the 2 disc set.  I have yet to watch disc 2.  However, disc one had quite a few extras itself including a bunch of deleted scenes.  The picture and sound were good So this is a pretty good value.-ADD IT ALL UP...... and you have a strange mix of brilliant visual FX, beautiful cinematography, uneven acting and a slightly bloated story.  The idea of formaldehyde mutating aquatic life to such a degree is something you will need to overlook to enjoy this film(I did immediately) .  You also better be ready to see Americans stereotyped as despicable opportunists without a thought for the consequences of their actions.  I thought it was more comical than offensive.  I never found this film too scary or gory; it's more of a drama. It has some seriously slow spots and somewhat unnecessary character development and a rather heavy handed political statement (I think it was the Directors attempt at being sublime). I found the monster scenes to be enthralling and entertaining and the overall visuals worthy of a better script.  I thought it was ok.

Some believe it to be one of the greatest foreign films in recent years, while others see it as one of the most influential monster movies of all time. I'm sorry, but I found this movie to be very mediocre. I didn't find the politics in the film distracting (the satire is pretty sharp here), but I did find the tone of the film very confusing. It tries to be a monster movie, a political thriller, a comedy, a family sitcom, and a drama all at the same time. It doesn't work here: these genres are all over the place, and it's a very unbalanced result. I did care about the characters, because they are really ordinary people like us. They act like how would really act when we come face to face with a dangerous beast. But the big problem here is when the young girl is kidnapped by the monster, and that was not a good idea. This plot thread has been recycled so many times in thrillers, action adventures, and horror flicks. And when it's used here, it feels very tired and uninteresting. The CGI effects of the monster itself look very realistic, and the monster itself looks really unique and threatening at times. It's proof that not ever monster has to be very gigantic like Godzilla. The best parts of the film occur in both the beginning and ending. Both are intense and dramatically powerful. Overall, I would like to have given this film at least four stars, but seeing how the story is a bit pretentious (and the tone of the film being unbalanced) it leaves me no choice but to bring it down a notch. I honestly didn't like the film very much, but it still kept my interest until the end.Grade: C-",3,Pretty much a hit and a miss,1267401600,"03 1, 2010",2010,1682,"['Host', 'been', 'given', 'lot', 'praise', 'critics', 'audiences', 'alike', 'believe', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'foreign', 'films', 'recent', 'years', 'others', 'see', 'one', 'most', 'influential', 'monster', 'movies', 'time', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'very', 'mediocre', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'politics', 'film', 'distracting', 'satire', 'pretty', 'sharp', 'here', 'did', 'find', 'tone', 'film', 'very', 'confusing', 'be', 'monster', 'movie', 'political', 'thriller', 'comedy', 'family', 'sitcom', 'drama', 'same', 'time', ""n't"", 'work', 'here', 'genres', 'are', 'place', 'very', 'unbalanced', 'result', 'did', 'care', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'ordinary', 'people', 'act', 'how', 'would', 'really', 'act', 'when', 'come', 'face', 'face', 'dangerous', 'beast', 'big', 'problem', 'here', 'when', 'young', 'girl', 'kidnapped', 'monster', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'idea', 'plot', 'thread', 'been', 'recycled', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'thrillers', 'action', 'adventures', 'horror', 'flicks', 'when', 'used', 'here', 'very', 'tired', 'uninteresting', 'CGI', 'effects', 'monster', 'look', 'very', 'realistic', 'monster', 'really', 'unique', 'threatening', 'times', 'proof', 'not', 'ever', 'monster', 'be', 'very', 'gigantic', 'Godzilla', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'occur', 'beginning', 'ending', 'are', 'intense', 'dramatically', 'powerful', 'Overall', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'given', 'film', 'least', 'four', 'stars', 'seeing', 'how', 'story', 'bit', 'pretentious', 'tone', 'film', 'being', 'unbalanced', 'choice', 'bring', 'down', 'notch', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'film', 'very', 'much', 'still', 'kept', 'interest', 'end.Grade', 'C-']",N/A

Anyway, the movie starts off great, but then by the time you get midway though, it gets way too overly clever and starts to use redundant plot characterizations over and over again. So in the end the beginning is great, then doesn't give a pay off until the end which is a novel twist at best for the sake of some sobering ""realism"" within the giant monster genre.I just ordered and watched a ton of Godzilla, Gamera movies prior to this, and they are stupid, yet typically much more enjoyable than this movie since your suspension of disbelief is non existent regarding those types of fun movies. The problem i found with this movie was that it TRIED to be more serious and most of the character actions were plain stupid. If you know you're dealing with this type of creature why act so stupid? And they showed almost next to no action taken by the military or local police in trying to strategize and capture, analyze of kill the creature at all.If you haven't seen this film, i'd suggest renting it or watching at a friends house before buying to own it. I was really excited to check it out but it comes up far short of what i was anticipating overall. Perhaps in time i'll find this fits a certain mood and i'll enjoy it more? doubt it, i'll just pop in King Kong Escapes and have a real good time laughing instead.Update: this movie grows on you, it's more moody and less predictable than most giant monster films... basically it's a more artistic approach to the genre.

However, even though this incident was inspired by a real event, when it's done by a country we saved from that nut up north, it just doesn't ring right. I can't say the America-bashing is really mean spirited, but it just seems wrong and out of place. It gives me the impression most Koreans don't think too highly of us which may or may not be true. After all, this is just a movie and not an official statement from the people of Korea. That was the minor reason for the three stars.The major reason for the three stars was the ending. I won't give it away, but I was not at all happy with who did or didn't make it.Still, despite its flaws, The Host is the best icky bug to come out in a while.

The Movie I would classify it as a action comedy. Think of the US version of Godzilla with the type of humor you would see in Shaolin Soccer/Kung Fu Hustle. The Plot is simple: Humans damage nature, nature creates anomaly, anomaly attacks humans (by taking child amongst others), humans attack each other and monster, humans kill monster. The Monster is actually very cool and the effects are decent. The movie does have its funny parts but I would not buy this movie as part of my repertoire.I have to admit that three things from the HD DVD version really kind of ruined the movie for me. 1st of the sound is not great. The movie hardly ever used the rear speakers. The other thing that really irked me off is that the movie is dubbed into English from Korean and there are no English subtitles (Only Spanish). I am a firm believer that movies should be watched in the language it was made to able too see intonation and the voice of the actor. Third as mentioned in the other reviews, the movie also froze in the last third of the movie twice, which I could get by using the fast forward button despite me having downloaded the latest firmware updates as of 8/4/07.

1071992,A20FK68BUB1IVA,B000PKG8SS,Happy Reader,"[1, 1]","In the morgue at an American base in South Korea, an American doctor orders his Korean assistant to dump a massive amount of cloudy (infected?) formaldehyde, even though it will go directly into the great Han river. The guilt-ridden assistant later commits suicide by jumping off a bridge into the river, but not before he sees something huge swimming in the water.This ""something"" makes itself known one sunny day when it rampages through the crowd picnicing on the river frontage. This is an awesome monster! It doesn't stand still long enough for me to get a good count of it's limbs, but there's story references to a squid having nine legs before we see the monster. And it has a long prehensile tail with the diamond shape tip of a squid tail. So I think I'm safe in saying that the creature is a monsterized squid.The plot references to the long sucker-""legs"" of a squid come from the Park family, operating a snack bar on the river. This is a quirky family, with great characterizations. Grandfather Hie-bong is in charge. One son, Nam-il, in his suit and tie, is a college graduate in need of a job. The daughter, Nam-ju, is participating in the Olympics when the monster makes itself known. And the eldest son, Kang-Du, has a good heart, but he can't seem to do anything right. That is, except for having a daughter, Hyun-seo.  She comes home from her day in junior high just in time for the monster to wrap its tail around her and cart her off into the river.Her aunt, Nam-ju, returns home with a bronze medal in archery, but all celebration is forgotten in the grief over the death of beloved Hyun-seo.  Then, wait for it, Kang-Du gets a call from his daughter!  Her battery is dying, but she has time to plead with her father to find her in the sewers. The monster has placed her, one alive amongst several bodies, in its larder.""The Host"" is old-fashioned in that, like an old Godzilla movie, it is the fault of man that there is a monster at all. And there is no blood and gore - but this is still a really cool monster and it does enjoy eating people. The government response is typically incompetent. Everyone is quarantined - an American soldier who came in contact with the monster exhibits a virus. The Korean police won't believe that Kang-Du received a call (and refuse to check his phone records). The Americans over-react by spraying everyone with a toxic chemical Agent Yellow.What's a family to do?  Put aside internal bickering, escape from the quarantine and go find their little girl, of course! And in the meantime, little Hyun-seo is showing her own mettle, doing what she can to outsmart the monster and protect an orphan boy added to the larder after her.There's a lot of humor, much of it stemming from Kang-Du's goofiness. The action sequences are really great, and the monster, have I mentioned this yet, is really GREAT! Unfortunately, the movie does have a sad ending, which is not old-fashioned (and which I won't give away).""The Host"" was South Korea's top-grossing film of all time when it came out in 2006. It deserves its accolades. A scary, intelligently written and beautifully filmed movie. And I usually don't appreciate horror/monster movies. I recommend watching it in Korean with English subtitles.

1071994,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000PKG8SS,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[6, 6]","THE HOST (original Korean title GWOEMUL) is a sneakily good film which was a hit in Cannes. Be aware that it contains an environmental message that isn't exactly subliminal and that, also, it shows the U.S. in a very dim light. Nevertheless, I easily got past all that and was soon very immersed in the movie. I really don't know how this film got past my movie radar, but thank goodness it did. I went into this not knowing much about it other than it was ostensibly a creature feature. But it's much more than that. THE HOST manages to integrate a strong family theme, an off the wall sense of fun, and an unpredictable, heartbreaking storyline which kept me on the edge of my seat. I truly did not know what would happen next, and that's a very good thing. As a bonus, this movie is also pretty funny.Some plot SPOILERS.It starts out in a U.S. Army Base morgue in Korea when an American lab technician has his lackey dump formaldehyde down the laboratory drains even though he knows that the toxic stuff will eventually flow into the Han River. Some years later, frequenters on the banks of the Han River witness a grotesque monstrosity shockingly emerge from the river and begin an all out rampage. Survivors of the attack are summarily rounded up by the government which, fearing a creature-initiated virus, then institutes a quarantine and hastily begins conducting tests on the parties involved.One particularly contentious family is very much involved in the doings. Held under quarantine, they are grieving the death of a 13-year-old girl named Hyum-seo, who was seen being carried away by the monster. Her father, the dim-witted Gang-du, receives a call on a cell from someone claiming to be Hyum-seo and that she's alive but being held captive in a hole under a bridge. Gang-du and his kin break away from quarantine and flee into the sewer system and begin their search for Hyum-seo.Meanwhile, time is running out for Hyum-seo. Lacking food and drink and imprisoned in a deep chasm, she knows that her chances are bleak as she now awaits her turn to become crunchy snacks for the creature. A further burden is laid on her shoulders when another survivor, this time a little boy, appears. At last, with hope dwindling faster and faster, she seizes one opportunity for escape.End SPOILERS.Absolutely, the film's star attraction is the beastie itself. But THE HOST focuses more on the quarrelling family members than on the monster, and this works to the film's advantage as we get the chance to know the characters and invest in what happens to them. The dysfunction in this family is never more strongly portrayed than in an early scene where they remain hilariously combative even as they mourn the supposed death of young Hyum-seo. Not to get all On-A-Very-Special-Blossom, but this film goes on to underline the power of kinship and how familial loyalties can overcome personal differences.The monster is part squid, part tadpole, and part Whatdaf--k!!. The thing shows up only sporadically, which serves to heighten the suspense and enhance its effectiveness. Its debut appearance is a freakin' doozy and quite surreal, done in broad daylight with its mangling and ravaging taking place out in the open. Usually, the monster is so huge that there's a sort of disconnect, what with the size differential between monster and man rendering man insignificant and ant-tiny. But this creature is only several sizes larger than a person, and so somehow there's more punch to its attacks and we get unobstructed views of various victims getting, well, pretty effed up. The creature, when it does get screen time, gallumps prodigiously, lending a convincing weight and presence. There's a fluid grace and ease in how it navigates the various bridge undercarriages. There's a sleek dexterity in how it scales walls. Me, I'm rendered pretty darn impressed. So, a well done to the CG work.THE HOST sows a lot of seeds: it subverts the monster horror genre and remains mostly unpredictable. Every so often it'll unleash moments of wicked slapstick humor and, later on, sober us up with scenes of poignancy. Oh, yes, it also calls out the U.S. military (Agent Yellow? I could see it). The scenes with the monster are spectacular. When watching THE HOST, prep yourself to be unsettled but then perhaps invigorated. You may even end up feeling sad.

1071995,A2ICW5OUWX2A2V,B000PKG8SS,Ian,"[2, 9]","A good way to judge a movie is to watch it far away from all the hype surrounding it at the time of it's release, especially when its being called just as good as Jaws or Alien (if the hype is that big, you had BETTER be good, or you are doomed).  Getting some distance away from it allows you to see the movie as it is, strengths and flaws, without the cloud of hype settling in over you.  With that in mind, I sat down to watch ""The Host"", knowing next to nothing about it, save that lots and lots of people were hyping it as the next great monster movie.  When the film faded to black and the credits began to roll, the first thing on my mind was, ""That's it?  This is supposed to be as good as Jaws?""Not by a long shot.  Not even close.""The Host"" tells the story of a South Korean family who are trying to rescue the youngest member of their family from a giant, mutated monster who has kidnapped and taken the girl to its lair.  With the government scrambling to contain and eliminate the creature, as well as a deadly virus it's carrying, it's up to the family to save the girl themselves.  In the right hands, it's a story that could have been incredibly powerful emotionally, yet falls flat on it's face, turning the film into yet another monster movie with great visual effects, but a dull plot and unlikeable characters.The family, the focus of the film, is a group of misfits, chief among them lazy and overweight dad Gang-du, who spends most of his time yelling, ""Hyun-seo!"" and running around.  His fellow family members poke fun at him for being an idiot, and he is.  When he's infected with a virus and told not to eat anything, he goes ahead and secretly scarfs down what looks like snail guts.  He breaks out of quarantine with the rest of his family, threatening to spread the infection to the entire city, threatening the lives of millions of people.  And at one point, his idiocy has disastrous consequences for someone else, and that point I just lost interest in him.  I don't care if his daughter is in mortal danger, this man is a complete idiot whom I wanted to die.  I didn't feel any sympathy for him in the slightest.  The rest of his family is a little better.  His older brother, who thinks going around monster hunting as a bad idea, at least has some common sense.  Gang-du's father just wants to get his granddaughter back, which I can understand.  Best of all is Gang's sister, Nam-joo, a national archer who is the most likable character due to the fact that she really doesn't do anything idiotic to begin with.The biggest flaw of the film is that it just feels very loose, and in need of tightening and focusing.  The tone bounces all over the place from horror to surprise to some weird comedy moments.  At times, it just seems to go on for too long and would benefit from editing and shortening the script, as well as cutting out a few characters (like the homeless boys, who's introduction into the story feels jarring and out of place).  The political subplots just don't work at all...the government seems well meaning and trying to take care of things, yet the film has a grudge against the united states.  Not knowing the inspiration behind the jabs at the united states, I found it even more bizarre when a government agent reveals a secret about the virus that left me scratching my head...even more so when a character undergoes completely unnecessary brain surgery that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  Ditto for the scene of the armed forces having a barbecue.  I think the film is trying to poke fun at bumbling governments, but I never got the feeling while watching the film.The best thing that can be said about ""The Host"" is that the creature itself is very cool.  The visual effects are fantastic throughout, and the monster does feel like a creature that could really happen.  The filmmakers also deserve credit for having the monster appear so early and in broad daylight throughout many frequent scenes, and even more credit for making the beast look realistic.  I especially liked seeing a touch of personality in it during a scene in the sewers when Hyun-seo tries to escape.But despite the excellent visual effects, ""The Host"" fails to impress.  I was never scared or amused when I watched the film, instead feeling only disbelief and anger at how stupid the characters were.  ""The Host"" ultimitly ends up as yet another monster movie with great visuals but unlikable characters and a dull plot, joining countless other monster movies in the same boat.  The thought of this movie joining ranks with ""Jaws"" and ""Alien"" is highly amusing...those two movies have stood the test of time because of having tight, focused stories, and memorable characters who do logical things, both good and bad, in the face of monsters.  While the rubber shark and the rubber suited alien will continue to thrill and enjoy audiences for decades to come, this overgrown tadpole will best be remembered as another example of how a loose and unfocused plot with unlikable characters will kill a movie, no matter how impressive the visual effects may be.",2,Has a good monster...and not much else,1257120000,"11 2, 2009",2009,5097,"['good',

1071996,A1E8RJN1L9UMHX,B000PKG8SS,IKCWMBFD,"[1, 5]","This is not a completely straightforward monster movie and will probably disappoint a lot of people expecting the wrong thing.  The director of this film did Memories of Murder, a very dark and excellent Seven-ish movie about one of the first serial killers in South Korea (see it; much better than this); people were quite surprised by this choice of a follow-up project, I gather.  I could see that some of the black humor here might be lost on viewers unfamiliar with his other work or just not paying attention.  For example, the mourning scene is quite genuinely sad but also quite comical at the very same time, and this sort of mix in the same scene isn't your typical Hollywood approach.  The reveal of the monster is another case in point where expectations are purposefully confounded (small spoiler alert).  I thought it was one of the funniest sequences I had seen in a genre picture in ages, and it is precisely the beauty of it that the monster does not have a slow steady unveiling throughout the movie, as some people have criticized the movie for.  The very brief shot of this wacky fish monster rampaging (lumbering) across the field in broad daylight from the woman's p.o.v. in the bus traveling overhead is absolutely priceless.Unfortunately, though I wanted to like this, I have to be honest about several things.  The script is a bit workmanlike and, after the first third or so, starts to feel more and more routine.  It almost feels like a first draft: things could have been much more interesting or compelling or different, but as it is the plot turns just kind of meander to the conclusion.  The movie's main characters don't quite have enough room to develop independently in my opinion, so, despite the heavy emphasis on their interaction and emotions, the movie doesn't really succeed for me as a family drama.  Also, while I am all for pointed critiques of American adventurism abroad (okay, hegemony, sorry to use the word), the film's politics, for which it has gotten some praise in some lefty-leaning media outlets, are simplistic and caricatured in the exact same way as the average Hollywood genre picture, it's just that the villains here are Americans and the obedient South Korean state.  Frankly, caricaturing your villains no matter what the politics of your movie is has rather limited rewards.  Also, people who enjoy nitpicking or attacking plausibility would have a field day with this, as many plot developments or actions are rather random, puzzling, or farfetched but really, it's a movie about a big walking man-eating amphibious creature, so that's probably a waste of your time.  On the whole, I was entertained and I am glad to have seen it but, after a great opening stretch, the movie for me lost some momentum and became less and less successful.  Better to go in with lowered expectations, but still, this is much better than the average.Don't watch the dubbed version; the dub is terrible, as bad as they usually are, and listening to mediocre poorly paid voice actors is pretty much a surefire way to ruin any possible appreciation for the positive features of this film (or others).

The main character is a slobbish layabout, employed by his father at the older man's food stand, which is on the banks of the Han river.  His brother is a drunken jobless college grad and their sister is a champion archer.  When the creature shows up and takes the main character's daughter, he and his quarrelsome family are forced to team up to rescue her, as none of the authorities believe she is still alive.  Along the way, they have dealings with the mob and have to continue to elude the authorities.  Meanwhile, the daughter has to struggle to stay alive in the creature's sewer lair.The acting in this movie is excellent overall and the events swing from comedic to moments of genuine pathos.  The monster is excellently rendered by the folks at WETA, looking very realistic and creepy.  The movie does tend to drag in a few spots, which is why I rated it four of five stars.

1071998,A1RMWCN45F0PF9,B000PKG8SS,"J. A. Eyon ""Little Raven""","[1, 1]","Seriously... this is one of the most fun scifi monster films I've ever seen. And an example of just how sophisticated Korean films are.Except for a brief bit of heroism, there is quite a bit of anti-American sentiment, however the protagonist is such an irresponsible dunderhead and the the Korean bureaucracy he must overcome is so thick headed that it all evens out (this has a very paranoidal conspiracy theory premise where even the World Health Organization plays a part in the villainy).The anti-Americanism begins at the start of the movie when an American officer orders a Korean subordinate to empty all the toxic chemicals down the drain (it used to be radioactivity, remember?). A few years later, a huge fish with long legs and a big appetite rises out of Seoul's Han River and rampages among picnickers. Among the casualities is the daughter of this ne'er-do-well man -- who soon discovers via cell phone that she's still alive deep in the sewers. So the father and his dysfunctional family (his father, brother and sister) set out to rescue her.The funny, quirky outlook moderates the horror (and political) aspects  and that's why I enjoyed this film. The story moves quickly. The special effects of the fish monster are top notch and with his dog-level cleverness he is a one of the show's interesting characters.The other characterizations are a little weak, especially the brother and sister. And the bad guys are comic stereotypes.

What can I say? Tastes differ...WILDLY.I enjoyed every minute of The Host, even (I might say, ""especially"") the parts without the monster. I loved the characters and the mixture of humor and horror. It was right up my alley!I agree with the sentiment to skip the overdubbing and go with the subtitled version. But then, that's almost always my recommendation with foreign films, so there's another bias for you.The opening sequence seems grafted on, as if someone somewhere along the line thought it essential to insert an American character into a film that doesn't need one, like they did with Raymond Burr in the original Godzilla. But that's a minor quibble that doesn't cost The Host a single star in my opinion.If you're looking for a gorefest, The Host isn't it. But it also isn't a kids' film! It's too intense, especially in regards to the trauma suffered by youngest member of the family. (No spoilers...enough said about that.)

1072000,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,B000PKG8SS,J. B. Hoyos,"[0, 1]","""The Host"" reminded me of those Godzilla movies I enjoyed watching as a child.  Godzilla began his long, illustrious career as a bad lizard but later became a good guy when he battled giant, grotesque creatures, such as the Smog Monster, that were the products of man's pollution.  The special effects have improved since the sixties and seventies, but we still know the voices are dubbed.  The plot for ""The Host"" is just as comical and unrealistic as the Godzilla movies, but the heart pounding excitement during the creature attacks remains the same.Most of the excitement, unfortunately, takes place near the beginning of the movie.  Once in a while we are treated with a creature attack but they are few and far between.  Family loss keeps the action moving.  A family's loss over their daughter/niece/granddaughter who was snatched by the creature and taken beneath the water.  However, there is light at the end of the tunnel (or sewer in this case) when the father receives a cell phone message from his daughter and the search begins.  The family must battle military police and doctors as they escape a quarantine and race for the sewers beneath a bridge where the creature was last seen.  There are moments of humor throughout the movie to prevent it from becoming too dark and depressing.It is interesting to watch a foreign film, especially a horror one involving a monster.  However, the closed captions for the DVD did not match what the actors were speaking in English.  Neither did the English subtitles which, I assumed, were a more precise translation for the Korean language.I would have given this movie four stars if there had been other creature attacks on large groups of people, such as a bus or a small cruise boat on the Han River.  The ending was disappointing.  Don't expect one that will shock and horrify you.  It ended on a rather dull, mundane note.  However, I do recommend watching this movie if you a fan of the nostalgic Godzilla movies, creature features, or ""nature gone wild."" genre.",3,"""Godzilla"" Enters The 21st Century",1206489600,"03 26, 2008",2008,2023,"['Host', 'reminded', 'Godzilla', 'movies', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'child', 'Godzilla', 'began', 'long', 'illustrious', 'career', 'bad', 'lizard', 'later', 'became', 'good', 'guy', 'when', 'battled', 'giant', 'grotesque', 'creatures', 'such', 'Smog', 'Monster', 'were', 'products', 'man', 'pollution', 'special', 'effects', 'have', 'improved', 'sixties', 'seventies', 'still', 'know', 'voices', 'are', 'dubbed', 'plot', 'Host', 'just', 'as', 'comical', 'unrealistic', 'Godzilla', 'movies', 'heart', 'pounding', 'excitement', 'creature', 'same.Most', 'excitement', 'unfortunately', 'place', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Once', 'while', 'are', 'treated', 'creature', 'attack', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'Family', 'loss', 'action', 'moving', 'family', 'loss', 'daughter/niece/granddaughter', 'who', 'was', 'snatched', 'creature', 'taken', 'beneath', 'water', 'However', 'light', 'end', 'tunnel', 'sewer', 'case', 'when', 'father', 'cell', 'phone', 'message', 'daughter', 'search', 'family', 'must', 'battle', 'military', 'police', 'doctors', 'escape', 'quarantine', 'race', 'sewers', 'beneath', 'bridge', 'where', 'creature', 'was', 'last', 'seen', 'are', 'moments', 'humor', 'movie', 'prevent', 'becoming', 'too', 'dark', 'depressing.It', 'interesting', 'watch', 'foreign', 'film', 'especially', 'horror', 'one', 'involving', 'monster', 'However', 'closed', 'captions', 'DVD', 'did', 'not', 'match', 'what', 'actors', 'were', 'speaking', 'English', 'did', 'English', 'subtitles', 'assumed', 'were', 'more', 'precise', 'translation', 'Korean', 'language.I', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'movie', 'four', 'stars', 'had', 'been', 'other', 'creature', 'attacks', 'large', 'groups', 'people', 'such', 'bus', 'small', 'cruise', 'boat', 'Han', 'River', 'ending', 'was', 'disappointing', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'one', 'will', 'shock', 'horrify', 'ended', 'rather', 'dull', 'mundane', 'note', 'However', 'do', 'recommend', 'watching', 'movie', 'fan', 'nostalgic', 'Godzilla', 'movies', 'creature', 'features', 'nature', 'gone', 'wild', 'genre']",N/A
1072001,A9LSLYQW28X6H,B000PKG8SS,Jeff Van Gastel,"[3, 4]","Like a couple of other reviewers here, I was excited by the reviews and buzz on this movie!  I love monster movies, and thought this would be a cool movie to watch.  Well....It is the year 2000, on an American military post in Seoul, South Korea.  An American and Korean doctor are pouring old Formaldehyde down the drain, which flows into the Han River.Forward 6 years later to the Han River.  A Grandfather, Park Hee-bong, and his son, Gang-du, run a food stand by the river.  Gang-du's daughter, Hyun-Seo, comes home, and they both watch Nam-Joo(Gang-du's sister) in the Seoul Olympics participating in archery.  A few minutes later, a large, moving mass is observed hanging from the local bridge.  It drops to the water and swims over to the shore, which now has a crowd watching the swimming mass.  It swims past them, and then in a few moments, appears down the water's edge charging towards them knocking people over.  In the next scenes, the director does an interesting job of using present motion and slow motion scenes to show the monster on the rampage.  The music is also very good as the monster chases and runs people over.  Gang-du, along with an American, attempt to combat the monster, which only provokes it more.  In the ensuing chaos, the monster snatches Hyun-Seo, and jumps back into the river.  It takes Hyun back to its lair, which becomes a dumping ground for all of its caught prey.  The government claims the creature carries a deadly virus that will infect everyone!  Gang-du is taken to a hospital, but later escapes with his family, when he receives a phone call from his daughter, who he thought was dead.  The rest of the movie is the attempted rescue of Hyun-Seo by the Grandfather and his 3 children.The monster (to me) is an amphibious mutant tadpole.  It is interesting how the director starts the monster acting rather tamely.  It basically just runs over people or knocks them into the water.  However, the more it chases, the more vicious it becomes, especially when it becomes entrapped with people inside a truck.  And definitely as the movie progresses, the more hungry and ferocious it becomes.  I liked the look of the monster, and the CGI department did a good job of its movement and speed.As already mentioned, there are definite scenes of humor in the film.  I thought some worked, but most of the time it took away from the building tension in the film.  That was my major problem with the film, is it could not decide whether to be a serious movie along the lines of Jaws, or a horror-comedy along the lines of Lake Placid.  That is just my take!The film really treats the Korean and American military as sneaky, untrustworthy, uncaring folk; and I would throw in the hospital staff also under that category.  The military just does not seem interested in ever catching or destroying this monster on the loose, until the very end.  And then they do not care if they get rid of the monster, or anyone else standing around for that matter.The DVD does come with a few extras:* There is commentary during the film with Director Bong Joon-HO* Deleted Scenes (most did not add to the movie)* Deleted News Clips (which did add more background to the movie)* Director Bong Joon-Ho's Reflections : where he basically apologizes to everyone who worked on the movie, was in the movie, or was around the filming of the movie.  This part is actually pretty humorous.I did enjoy the movie overall, but definite parts of the movie were too slow, and I felt it never could decide what it really wanted to be: a serious monster film or a horror-comedy!",3,Mutant Tadpole Attacking Clueless Civilians and Military!,1187049600,"08 14, 2007",2007,3587,"['couple', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'was', 'excited', 'reviews', 'buzz', 'movie', 'love', 'monster', 'movies', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'cool', 'movie', 'watch', 'Well', '.It', 'year', '2000', 'American', 'military', 'post', 'Seoul', 'South', 'Korea', 'American', 'Korean', 'doctor', 'are', 'pouring', 'old', 'Formaldehyde', 'down', 'drain', 'Han', 'River.Forward', '6', 'years', 'later', 'Han', 'River', 'Grandfather', 'Park', 'Hee-bong', 'son', 'Gang-du', 'run', 'food', 'stand', 'river', 'Gang-du', 'daughter', 'Hyun-Seo', 'home', 'watch', 'Nam-Joo', 'Gang-du', 'sister', 'Seoul', 'Olympics', 'participating', 'archery', 'few', 'minutes', 'later', 'large', 'moving', 'mass', 'observed', 'hanging', 'local', 'bridge', 'water', 'shore', 'now', 'crowd', 'watching', 'swimming', 'mass', 'then', 'few', 'moments', 'down', 'water', 'edge', 'charging', 'towards', 'knocking', 'people', 'next', 'scenes', 'director', 'interesting', 'job', 'using', 'present', 'motion', 'slow', 'motion', 'scenes', 'show', 'monster', 'rampage', 'music', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'monster', 'chases', 'people', 'Gang-du', 'American', 'attempt', 'combat', 'monster', 'only', 'more', 'ensuing', 'chaos', 'monster', 'Hyun-Seo', 'back', 'river', 'Hyun', 'back', 'lair', 'dumping', 'ground', 'caught', 'prey', 'government', 'creature', 'deadly', 'virus', 'will', 'infect', 'everyone', 'Gang-du', 'taken', 'hospital', 'later', 'escapes', 'family', 'when', 'phone', 'call', 'daughter', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'dead', 'rest', 'movie', 'attempted', 'rescue', 'Hyun-Seo', 'Grandfather', '3', 'children.The', 'monster', 'amphibious', 'mutant', 'tadpole', 'interesting', 'how', 'director', 'monster', 'acting', 'rather', 'tamely', 'basically', 'just', 'over', 'people', 'knocks', 'water', 'However', 'more', 'more', 'vicious', 'especially', 'when', 'entrapped', 'people', 'truck', 'definitely', 'movie', 'more', 'hungry', 'ferocious', 'liked', 'look', 'monster', 'CGI', 'department', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'movement', 'speed.As', 'already', 'mentioned', 'are', 'definite', 'scenes', 'humor', 'film', 'thought', 'worked', 'most', 'time', 'took', 'away', 'building', 'tension', 'film', 'was', 'major', 'problem', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'decide', 'be', 'serious', 'movie', 'lines', 'Jaws', 'horror-comedy', 'lines', 'Lake', 'Placid', 'just', 'take', 'film', 'really', 'Korean', 'American', 'military', 'sneaky', 'untrustworthy', 'uncaring', 'folk', 'would', 'throw', 'hospital', 'staff', 'also', 'category', 'military', 'just', 'not', 'seem', 'interested', 'ever', 'catching', 'destroying', 'monster', 'loose', 'very', 'end', 'then', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'get', 'rid', 'monster', 'anyone', 'else', 'standing', 'around', 'matter.The', 'DVD', 'come', 'few', 'extras', '*', 'commentary', 'film', 'Director', 'Bong', 'Joon-HO*', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'most', 'did', 'not', 'add', 'movie', '*', 'Deleted', 'News', 'Clips', 'did', 'add', 'more', 'background', 'movie', '*', 'Director', 'Bong', 'Joon-Ho', 'Reflections', 'where', 'basically', 'everyone', 'who', 'worked', 'movie', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'filming', 'movie', 'part', 'actually', 'pretty', 'humorous.I', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'overall', 'definite', 'parts', 'movie', 'were', 'too', 'slow', 'felt', 'never', 'could', 'decide', 'what', 'really', 'wanted', 'be', 'serious', 'monster', 'film', 'horror-comedy']",N/A

To do that, and still be able to make an emotionally sad movie is not something I have seen before. After watching this I thought it was a good genre-blending movie. Director Joon-ho BongMemories of Murder-(great film by the way) goes for a very character centric feel, using the Park family as the nucleus of the movie and not as you would expect the creature itself. In many ways the Host is more a natural disaster movie than a creature feature at times. Though like Godzilla, the creature is the result of man's disregard for the environment, that is really where a lot of the comparisons end. With this film being quite different from Toho's legendary suitmation icon's outings, which where all about the big G himself and humans merely incidental. Though you might be able to compare this a little more to the American Godzilla remake, if only to see how a CGI monster movie should be done and to remind yourself just how lame Roland Emmerich's movie really was. How ever when the creature does turn up in Bongs movie it does have a really good impact with several instances making me jump a bit, after being lulled into a false sense of security by the stretches of monster free screen time.The initial appearance of the creature under the bridge and the chaos that ensues is some of the best creature action put on film in a long, long time. The creature is well designed and for the most part the CGI is very good. The way it moves is great and very original. I think they might have gone a bit overboard on the mouth design as this is a mutant of some kind and not an alien, but really that's being picky about a great design. Personally I would have liked just a bit more creature action in the rest of the film, I appreciate the director's idea to give it a sense of the dramatic and the real, but I didn't care that much about some of the character interplay and subplots. That said all the cast where pretty good in their roles with Kang-ho Song holding his own well in the starring role and Hie-bong Byeon excellent as his father. Newcomer Ah-sung Ko as the young Hyun-seo does an amazing job in her scenes around the creature considering its all CGI. She has some really convincing facial expressions and manages to give a really natural performance a million miles removed from that horrible precious trained acting kid stuff we put up with from many western movies.""The Host"" for the most part manages to be pretty successful at avoiding being as one dimensional as it so easily could have been (though that's not such a bad thing with creature features). Bong manages to balance comedy, terror, sadness and action well and create a believable human tale in amongst the unbelievable nature of the films theme. The film has a slightly, I won't say anti American, because that's not true, its more a slightly condemning look at the America's environmental polices or lack of them. One thing the story does present well is the way authorities so concerned with the big picture, will often ignore the individual. In this case leaving Kang du with only his family to turn to and the way the seemingly dysfunctional family without question band together to save Hyun-seo is great. The films finish is not anywhere near as strong as its start and though still good is a bit weak in my opinion, although it does manage to surprise in some ways. I'm sure this flick will be remade by Hollywood soon, though they may slightly alter the premise.

When I finally got around to watching it, I was greatly pleased... at first.  Once the perfunctory main character introductions were taken care of in the opening of the film, the action explodes into delightfully wicked beast-fueled mayhem, well shot and hard to look away from.  Instead of keeping the WETA-designed creature partially hidden or somehow vague, it suddenly and violently reveals itself in its full multi-fish-tailed glory, in broad daylight and the camera doesn't miss an inch of it.  Its a pretty bold idea, especially since the slow reveal and intentional obscuring of monsters is one of the many rules that monster/horror movies live by.  Not to mention that the full reveal wouldn't have worked had the special effects not been carefully handled.  And for the most part the creature design and the CGI that gives it life are well done, about as top as broad daylight CGI movie monsters can be.  What cheesiness there is in the monster scenes, I was willing to forgive given that this is a smaller-than Hollywood budgeted South Korean film.  Unfortunately, after the initial portion of the movie, the characters do fall into predictable roles and tend to get mired in nonsensical, or at least nonessential sub-plots.  By the end the whole story becomes quite muddled, and the parts that get the most attention (the Virus sub-plot and the Agent Yellow controversy) don't really make sense.  Not in a confusing way, it's just that the mishmash of ideas interjected at various points along the way is much too convoluted for it's own good.  The pacing becomes very rushed towards the end, naturally, but because of awkward storytelling, important events happen much too abruptly and inexplicably, like the bit with the hobo.  Whatever.  Point is: when the movie ended I felt very dissatisfied.  Oddly enough had the film ended right after the very first monster attack, I probably would given it five stars.  My advice to Americans looking for exciting South Korean film: Skip this in favor of ""Oldboy.""",3,Killed by the Hype-Machine,1185321600,"07 25, 2007",2007,2130,"['many', 'went', 'movie', 'having', 'read', 'great', 'number', 'reviews', 'praising', 'quality', 'originality', 'When', 'finally', 'got', 'watching', 'was', 'greatly', 'pleased', 'first', 'Once', 'perfunctory', 'main', 'character', 'introductions', 'were', 'taken', 'care', 'opening', 'film', 'action', 'delightfully', 'wicked', 'beast-fueled', 'mayhem', 'well', 'shot', 'hard', 'look', 'away', 'Instead', 'keeping', 'WETA-designed', 'creature', 'partially', 'somehow', 'vague', 'suddenly', 'violently', 'reveals', 'full', 'multi-fish-tailed', 'glory', 'broad', 'daylight', 'camera', ""n't"", 'miss', 'inch', 'pretty', 'bold', 'idea', 'especially', 'slow', 'reveal', 'intentional', 'obscuring', 'monsters', 'one', 'many', 'rules', 'monster/horror', 'movies', 'live', 'Not', 'mention', 'full', 'reveal', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'worked', 'had', 'special', 'effects', 'not', 'been', 'carefully', 'handled', 'most', 'part', 'creature', 'design', 'CGI', 'life', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'about', 'as', 'top', 'broad', 'daylight', 'CGI', 'movie', 'monsters', 'can', 'be', 'What', 'cheesiness', 'monster', 'scenes', 'was', 'willing', 'forgive', 'given', 'smaller-than', 'Hollywood', 'budgeted', 'South', 'Korean', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'initial', 'portion', 'movie', 'characters', 'do', 'fall', 'predictable', 'roles', 'tend', 'get', 'mired', 'nonsensical', 'least', 'nonessential', 'sub-plots', 'end', 'whole', 'story', 'quite', 'muddled', 'parts', 'get', 'most', 'attention', 'Virus', 'sub-plot', 'Agent', 'Yellow', 'controversy', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'Not', 'confusing', 'way', 'just', 'mishmash', 'ideas', 'interjected', 'various', 'points', 'way', 'much', 'too', 'convoluted', 'own', 'good', 'pacing', 'becomes', 'very', 'rushed', 'end', 'naturally', 'awkward', 'storytelling', 'important', 'events', 'happen', 'much', 'too', 'abruptly', 'inexplicably', 'bit', 'hobo', 'Point', 'when', 'movie', 'ended', 'felt', 'very', 'dissatisfied', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'had', 'film', 'ended', 'right', 'very', 'first', 'monster', 'attack', 'probably', 'would', 'given', 'five', 'stars', 'advice', 'Americans', 'looking', 'exciting', 'South', 'Korean', 'film', 'Skip', 'favor', 'Oldboy']",N/A
1072008,A3N0LBOUQAD1BG,B000PKG8SS,"Jonnathan Ritland ""Hank Peters, Italian Grocer""","[0, 0]","(Possible Spoilers)There's some illegal dumping going on, a little amphibious creature falls into a body of water and swim off, then a few years later on the shores of the Han River in South Korea, some onlookers see a strange creature hanging from a bridge, it drops into the river and soon after comes to the shore. This creature proceeds to wreak havoc, by knocking around the nearby tents and food stands, stomping and knocking people out of the way, killing a few and in this whole melee it takes the daughter of a young man named Park Gang-Doo (Kang-ho Song, ""Thirst"") and jumps back into the Han River.The remainder of the movie involves Gang-Doo and his extended family trying to find his daughter and kill this creature. There's equal parts comedy, drama and some good scares from the monster attacks on the locals, the dialogue which is mainly subtitled outside of a few american actors is pretty good and witty. The opening monster attack is probably one of the best sequences ever in these type of movies, it stays at a great pace and the creature is fairly unique looking (not an easy thing to do since most everything has been done to death when it comes to monster design).Loved the scenes too with the daughter and another captured boy as they were pretty much how any kid would try to deal with the horror that surrounds them. There's the underlying story in the movie about whether the government is lying about this monster carrying a deadly virus and that it needs to be avoided (cause the first thing any rational person would do is approach a deadly creature like that, right?).What makes ""The Host"", way, way better than most any monster flick is how layered it is, director Bong Joon-Ho keeps it balanced, the horror appears in good spots, the comedy is good and refreshing and the acting actually is pretty good, with most of the actors appearing quite believable. I highly recommend ""The Host"" to anyone that enjoys monster films, you just have to be prepared to read (if you watch the subtitled version that is, which is the best way in my opinion).The extras include: Deleted scenes, commentary from Bong Joon-Ho, making of ""The Host"", special effects featurette, cast interviews, a gag reel and much more.",5,The Korean Monster Mash.....,1345680000,"08 23, 2012",2012,2234,"['Possible', 'Spoilers', 'illegal', 'dumping', 'going', 'little', 'amphibious', 'creature', 'body', 'water', 'swim', 'off', 'then', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'shores', 'Han', 'River', 'South', 'Korea', 'onlookers', 'see', 'strange', 'creature', 'hanging', 'bridge', 'river', 'soon', 'shore', 'creature', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'knocking', 'nearby', 'tents', 'food', 'stands', 'stomping', 'knocking', 'people', 'way', 'killing', 'few', 'whole', 'melee', 'daughter', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Park', 'Gang-Doo', 'Kang-ho', 'Song', 'Thirst', 'back', 'Han', 'River.The', 'remainder', 'movie', 'Gang-Doo', 'extended', 'family', 'trying', 'find', 'daughter', 'kill', 'creature', 'equal', 'parts', 'comedy', 'drama', 'good', 'scares', 'monster', 'attacks', 'locals', 'dialogue', 'mainly', 'subtitled', 'outside', 'few', 'american', 'actors', 'pretty', 'good', 'witty', 'opening', 'monster', 'attack', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'sequences', 'ever', 'type', 'movies', 'great', 'pace', 'creature', 'fairly', 'unique', 'looking', 'not', 'easy', 'thing', 'do', 'most', 'everything', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'when', 'monster', 'design', '.Loved', 'scenes', 'too', 'daughter', 'captured', 'boy', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'how', 'kid', 'would', 'try', 'deal', 'horror', 'underlying', 'story', 'movie', 'government', 'lying', 'monster', 'carrying', 'deadly', 'virus', 'be', 'avoided', 'cause', 'first', 'thing', 'rational', 'person', 'would', 'do', 'approach', 'deadly', 'creature', 'right', 'Host', 'way', 'way', 'better', 'most', 'monster', 'flick', 'how', 'layered', 'director', 'Bong', 'Joon-Ho', 'balanced', 'horror', 'good', 'spots', 'comedy', 'good', 'refreshing', 'acting', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'most', 'actors', 'appearing', 'quite', 'believable', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Host', 'anyone', 'monster', 'films', 'just', 'have', 'be', 'prepared', 'read', 'watch', 'subtitled', 'version', 'best', 'way', 'opinion', 'extras', 'include', 'Deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'Bong', 'Joon-Ho', 'making', 'Host', 'special', 'effects', 'featurette', 'cast', 'interviews', 'gag', 'reel', 'much', 'more']",N/A

The rollercoaster ride basically is peak-dip-peak, yet the dip has a few jolting bumps in it as well. Overall the film is enjoyable.So many funny moments, from the family reunion to the cross-eyed doctor! The bronze medalist daughter is cool, too. A great varietal mix overall.The monster is flat-out awesome...very acrobatic, too.As for the disc, the menu screen is a bit cheesy, but nothing that should influence a purchase either way. However, during the feature you'll probably notice a lockup [on the copy I rented as well as those of many whose reviews I've read] both as the authorities place a sack over Park Gang-du's head, as well as after the screen fades out from the final action sequence (there's still alittle bit of movie left after that point). I was able to fiddle around with rewinding it and fast forwarding it to just after the lockup and got things moving again, but how lame it is to have to do that.I don't really recommend ""buying"" this disc to own, but I do feel it is a must see - either rent it or if you can handle the quirks go ahead and buy it...it is a cool movie.

Everyone is standing around looking at this thing on a bridge... and it was pretty freaky. The monster looked great from far away as it dangled off the bridge and the next scene when we actually see the monster attack was awesome! After that it was pretty much downhill. It turned into a movie about the family, all of who were annoying except for the main character who was looking for his daughter. I liked him, but the rest of the family were lame. This movie tried too hard to be funny and to make a social commentary, but it didn't try hard enough to be scary. It wasn't scary at all after the first 30 minutes. The special effects seemed to get worse as the minutes ticked away and there were a few scenes of the monster where it looked so silly and fake that it was disappointing. However there were other scenes of the monster where it looked very cool and ultra creepy. This movie suffers from being uneven and scattered. I can't figure out in my head how to classify this movie... Was it a monster movie? Was it an action movie? Was it a black comedy? Was it a pandemic movie?

The creature is totally believable and it has a personality that shines thru the FX --- that creature OWNS the ground it walks on.  The characters are wonderfully developed and I like that the story is told thru the viewpoint of the family -- not of the authorities as most monster movies are.  The mayhem is rendered realistically -- but no emphasis is put on blood and gore.There are a couple places where the sub-titling is very hard to read against the background color ........ but not many.Overall I say this is a delightful film and a great addition to anyone's collection.,5,Top-Notch Monster pic,1349827200,"10 10, 2012",2012,683,"['Aside', 'fact', 'uncaring', 'American', 'cause', 'trouble', 'movie', 'GEM', 'creature', 'totally', 'believable', 'personality', 'FX', 'creature', 'OWNS', 'ground', 'characters', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'developed', 'like', 'story', 'told', 'viewpoint', 'family', 'not', 'authorities', 'most', 'monster', 'movies', 'are', 'mayhem', 'rendered', 'realistically', 'emphasis', 'put', 'blood', 'are', 'couple', 'places', 'where', 'sub-titling', 'very', 'hard', 'read', 'background', 'color', '..', 'not', 'many.Overall', 'say', 'delightful', 'film', 'great', 'addition', 'anyone', 'collection']",N/A

Ultimately though, The Host will be quickly recognized as one of the most effective monster movies in decades.  I'm not exaggerating; it is a shining example of a film that makes me wonder over and over again while watching it, why doesn't anyone make movies like this anymore?  Evidently, South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho (Memories of Murder) does, and The Host quickly became the highest grossing South Korean film ever made.The Host opens with an American ordering the removal of many gallons of formaldehyde.  He orders his assistant to pour the toxic chemical into the drain, which will ultimately place it into the Han River.  We are then introduced to the protagonists of the film, a South Korean family, two of which run a snack bar in front of the Han River.  A giant creature comes out of the river and snatches up a little girl who is part of this family.  The family grieves her loss while the government converges onto the scene and begins to indicate that the monster may be the cause of a new virus and that anyone who had contact with it should be quarantined.  The family receives some indication that the little girl is alive and so they opt to make an effort to save her.  Many scenes with the monster follow and it doesn't disappoint.Monster movies of old invoke feelings of fear, excitement, action, and suspense; but have traditionally required more imagination than other genres.  If there is mystery about the monster or we don't see it as much we quickly creep into the horror genre, but The Host does not do this.  If there is no mystery we run the risk of seeing something we don't believe and that is when our imaginations must take over.  The Host doesn't need its audience to do that either.  It is shear madness and we are compelled to believe this is real.  The drama assists tremendously and the comedic aspects serve to make the characters even more enjoyable while placing the film into a fairly convincing frame.  The first time we see the monster is in broad daylight and it attacks crowds of people along the shore, only to submerge again.  There is a moment in Jurassic Park where I felt an amazing sense of hope in great filmmaking combined with great technology.  It is the first time we see the dinosaurs.  Since that time I've grown a bit cynical toward technology's role in film, but The Host reinvigorates that hope.  It is great action, great drama, great comedy, and great horror all mixed together.The front of the box on the DVD indicates that The Host is on par with Jaws.  As someone who believes Jaws to be among the greatest films ever made it would take time to concur with such a statement, but The Host is definitely worth viewing.",5,Incredibly Entertaining Modernized Monster Movie,1185840000,"07 31, 2007",2007,2823,"['Host', 'South', 'Korean', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'strong', 'sense', 'character', 'development', 'even', 'emphasis', 'humor', 'Ultimately', 'Host', 'will', 'be', 'quickly', 'recognized', 'one', 'most', 'effective', 'monster', 'movies', 'decades', ""'m"", 'not', 'exaggerating', 'shining', 'example', 'film', 'wonder', 'over', 'again', 'watching', 'why', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'make', 'movies', 'anymore', 'Evidently', 'South', 'Korean', 'filmmaker', 'Bong', 'Joon-ho', 'Memories', 'Murder', 'Host', 'quickly', 'became', 'highest', 'grossing', 'South', 'Korean', 'film', 'ever', 'Host', 'American', 'ordering', 'removal', 'many', 'gallons', 'formaldehyde', 'orders', 'assistant', 'pour', 'toxic', 'chemical', 'drain', 'will', 'ultimately', 'place', 'Han', 'River', 'are', 'then', 'introduced', 'protagonists', 'film', 'South', 'Korean', 'family', 'two', 'run', 'snack', 'bar', 'front', 'Han', 'River', 'giant', 'creature', 'river', 'up', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'part', 'family', 'family', 'loss', 'government', 'scene', 'indicate', 'monster', 'may', 'be', 'cause', 'new', 'virus', 'anyone', 'who', 'had', 'contact', 'should', 'be', 'quarantined', 'family', 'indication', 'little', 'girl', 'alive', 'so', 'opt', 'make', 'effort', 'save', 'Many', 'scenes', 'monster', 'follow', ""n't"", 'disappoint.Monster', 'movies', 'old', 'invoke', 'feelings', 'fear', 'excitement', 'action', 'suspense', 'have', 'traditionally', 'required', 'more', 'imagination', 'other', 'genres', 'mystery', 'monster', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'as', 'much', 'quickly', 'creep', 'horror', 'genre', 'Host', 'not', 'do', 'mystery', 'run', 'risk', 'seeing', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'when', 'imaginations', 'must', 'take', 'over', 'Host', ""n't"", 'need', 'audience', 'do', 'shear', 'madness', 'are', 'compelled', 'believe', 'real', 'drama', 'tremendously', 'comedic', 'aspects', 'serve', 'make', 'characters', 'even', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'placing', 'film', 'fairly', 'convincing', 'frame', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'monster', 'broad', 'daylight', 'crowds', 'people', 'shore', 'only', 'submerge', 'again', 'moment', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'where', 'felt', 'amazing', 'sense', 'hope', 'great', 'filmmaking', 'combined', 'great', 'technology', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'dinosaurs', 'time', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'bit', 'cynical', 'technology', 'role', 'film', 'Host', 'reinvigorates', 'hope', 'great', 'action', 'great', 'drama', 'great', 'comedy', 'great', 'horror', 'mixed', 'together.The', 'front', 'box', 'DVD', 'Host', 'par', 'Jaws', 'someone', 'who', 'Jaws', 'be', 'greatest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'would', 'take', 'time', 'concur', 'such', 'statement', 'Host', 'definitely', 'worth', 'viewing']",N/A

1072016,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000PKG8SS,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[67, 78]","I felt a bit of skepticism when I heard that the top-grossing film in Korean history was headed to a big screen near me--and (gulp!) it was a ""Godzilla"" type monster movie. And then the critical reviews started pouring in--let's just say, they're pretty impressive! So intrigued, but still very wary, I headed out to Bong Joon-ho's ""The Host."" After a brief setup and a quick introduction to an impossibly dysfunctional family, a creature emerges from the Han River and starts to terrorize the citizens of Seoul. And I was hooked! Frightening and funny, the emergence of this indescribable creature (part fish, part ""Alien,"" part unmentionable) is so well staged--I was alternately shocked and amused. From that moment on, ""The Host"" never let go and became a wildly entertaining ride.The film introduces us to an unlikely group of protagonists--an inept and childlike man (played by Song Kang-ho), his put-upon father, and his school aged daughter. When the creature first attacks the city, the daughter is carried away. Grieving for her, father and son are reunited with Kang-ho's other siblings--a sister who is a competitive archer and a brother, college educated but unemployed. This quartet clearly has issues, and Kang-ho feels guilty for what has happened. After being isolated by the military for having been exposed to the creature (now being reported as the host of an unknown virus), Kang-ho becomes convinced his daughter is still alive. The family bands together and decides to break out and track down the creature's movements in an effort to locate the girl. Equal parts believable family interplay, genuine horror, slapstick, and harrowing moments with surprisingly real consequences--""The Host"" is a multilayered film that works on many levels.One of the more questionable critiques that I've encountered about ""The Host"" is that its anti-American posturing is offensive. This being, first and foremost, a creature feature--I find this a tad oversensitive. The overt acts of villainy perpetuated by the Americans in question (such as the careless dumping of formaldehyde into the environment) are done with such a gleeful, over-the-top tone--it has more of a comedic effect than anything. In cartoons, these scientific or military ""villains"" would be twirling their mustaches and cackling at an evil plot. And, in fact, the first real ""hero"" of the piece is an American soldier who stands up to the creature to save others. It's a bit of a double standard, as well. How many times do American films cast another country in the same light (or much worse)? It strikes me as the ""you can dish it out, but you can't take it"" syndrome if Americans aren't able to take a bit of satiric poking every once in a while from someone else. However, in the main scheme of things--the characters within ""The Host"" couldn't care less about the political climate. Much of the international relations information is provided as background via TV reports that are generally being ignored!Now that I've made this film sound political, let me just reiterate--it's not. It's wild, it's fun, it's scary, it's unexpected--but most surprisingly, it's also genuinely moving. I actually cared about the central family in ""The Host."" Ordinary citizens, they are thrust into the role of heroes. They put aside their differences, come together as a family, and sacrifice everything they have for one another. Comedically complicated, they still convey real familial devotion. The forward momentum of the film is provided by love and a commitment to endure any hardship for those close to you. So this B-movie monster flick is grounded by, of all things, heart. I can understand someone not liking ""The Host."" A monster running amok in a scary movie is not for everyone (and, although, I mention comedic elements a lot--this is a scary movie). But adding the wackiness, the slapstick, and (most especially, for some) the subtitles--you're bound to have your share of detractors. But I found ""The Host"" great fun. The creature looks awesome and the action scenes, in particular, are riveting. Do yourself a favor, if you're into this type of film--check out ""The Host.""

Olsen-Keyser ""BookChick""","[1, 4]","Gwoemul is a cautionary, political tale of environmental awareness (ultimately caused by the stupidity of an American) in the vane of Gojira. Above all, it's a story about four family members banding together for a common cause. Park Hie-bong (Hie-bong Byeon) and his son Gang-Du (Kang-ho Song) run a small food stand near the Wonyho Bridge along the Han River. Gang-Du, a somewhat dim witted man, has one daughter, school girl Hyun-seo (Ah-sung Ko). He also has a brother, Nam-il (Hae-il Park) and a sister Nam-joo (Du-na Bae). Nam-il,a college graduate with a somewhat questionable past, hasn't done much with his life except drink. Nam-joo is a national medalist in archery who can never seem to get more than a bronze. When a creature emerges from the Han River and captures Hyun-seo, the somewhat dysfunctional family has to overcome their differences to get her back. Taking on red tape, American interference, the threat of a virus and Korean politics, they stand together in their conviction that she is still alive and set out to find her on their own. Watching them overcome their general distaste for one another lead by their venerable father is entertaining, comical and at times very touching.The story and special effects are phenomenal. The acting is fantastic as long as you stay away from the English dubbed version. Do yourself a favor and listen to the Korean acting and take the time to read the subtitles. In addition, most of the humor is completely lost in the English dubbing and there are quite of few moments of brevity in this film.

1072019,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000PKG8SS,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 4]","The obvious frame of reference is to say that ""Gwoemul"" (""The Host"") is in the grand tradition of Japanese monster movies such as the original ""Gojira"" from 1954.  But while the monster is indeed a mutant it is not in a rubber suit, this 2006 film comes from South Korea rather than Japan, and the climax does not involve a showdown between the monster and the army.  That being said, director Bong Joon-ho (""Memories of Murder"") has put together the best good old fashioned monster movie that I have seen in a long time, and one that is certainly going to erase the bad memories we have of the lamentable remake of ""Godzilla.""  The result is not perfect, but this one certainly has its moments.Supposedly because his bottles are dusty, the pathologist at a U.S. military base makes his assistant toss cases of formaldehyde down the drain and into the Han River.  A short while latter a monstrous creature emerges in broad daylight and starts scattering spectators right and left.  Our unlikely hero is Park Gang-du (Song Kang-ho), a Seoul snack vendor with a tendency towards narcolepsy, who likes with his daughter Hyun-seo (Ko Ah-sung), and his father, Hie-bong (Byeon Hie-bong).  When the monster starts attacking Gang-du and an off-duty American serviceman (David Joseph Anselmo) try to do something about it, without much success.  Then Hyun-seo walks out of the shop and into the madness and in a harrowing scene her father is unable to save her.  Mourning the loss of Hyun-seo are not only her father and grandfather, but Gang-du's brother Nam-il (Park Hae-il), an alcoholic, and his sister Nam-joo (Bae Du-na), an archery medallist.  But then two things happen: the family is quarantined by the government, who are worried that the monster has contaminated people who come into contact with it, and Gang-du gets a cell phone call from Hyun-seo, who says she is somewhere in the Seoul sewar system, apparently being kept as a snack for the beastie.It seems strange to say that ""The Host"" will remind you as much of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" as it will ""Godzilla,"" but when you have a dysfunctional family in a van trying to band together for the sake of a young girl the comparison strikes me as inevitable.  The obvious thing to complain about here is the length because you have to think that less would be more with this film running 1:59, but it seems that in South Korea audiences expect their movies to run two hours long and that is what this one does (it is the biggest blockbuster in South Korean movie history).  But on the plus side the computer generated monster is pretty impressive, and that is half the battle in a monster movie like this one.  Still, regardless of length there is something of disconnect between the set up and the pay off in this film, which, despite the predictability what with an archer running around an all, will surprise you.  This is a film that wants to work comedy in the mix, and while it often works in the end I am not sure if it was appropriate.  However, all things considered ""The Host"" is definitely worth seeing for fans of monster movies and may well become a personal favorite in that particular genre.",4,One of the better giant mutant monster movies in some time,1185321600,"07 25, 2007",2007,3160,"['obvious', 'frame', 'reference', 'say', 'Gwoemul', 'Host', 'grand', 'tradition', 'Japanese', 'monster', 'movies', 'such', 'original', 'Gojira', '1954', 'monster', 'indeed', 'mutant', 'not', 'rubber', 'suit', '2006', 'film', 'South', 'Korea', 'rather', 'Japan', 'climax', 'not', 'involve', 'showdown', 'monster', 'army', 'being', 'said', 'director', 'Bong', 'Joon-ho', 'Memories', 'Murder', 'put', 'together', 'best', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'monster', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'one', 'certainly', 'going', 'erase', 'bad', 'memories', 'have', 'lamentable', 'remake', 'Godzilla', 'result', 'not', 'perfect', 'one', 'certainly', 'moments.Supposedly', 'bottles', 'are', 'dusty', 'pathologist', 'U.S.', 'military', 'base', 'assistant', 'toss', 'cases', 'formaldehyde', 'drain', 'Han', 'River', 'short', 'while', 'latter', 'monstrous', 'creature', 'broad', 'daylight', 'scattering', 'spectators', 'right', 'left', 'unlikely', 'hero', 'Park', 'Gang-du', 'Song', 'Kang-ho', 'Seoul', 'snack', 'vendor', 'tendency', 'narcolepsy', 'who', 'daughter', 'Hyun-seo', 'Ko', 'Ah-sung', 'father', 'Hie-bong', 'Byeon', 'Hie-bong', 'When', 'monster', 'attacking', 'Gang-du', 'off-duty', 'American', 'serviceman', 'David', 'Joseph', 'Anselmo', 'try', 'do', 'something', 'much', 'success', 'Then', 'Hyun-seo', 'walks', 'shop', 'madness', 'harrowing', 'scene', 'father', 'unable', 'save', 'Mourning', 'loss', 'Hyun-seo', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'father', 'grandfather', 'Gang-du', 'brother', 'Nam-il', 'Park', 'Hae-il', 'alcoholic', 'sister', 'Nam-joo', 'Bae', 'Du-na', 'archery', 'medallist', 'then', 'two', 'things', 'happen', 'family', 'quarantined', 'government', 'who', 'are', 'worried', 'monster', 'contaminated', 'people', 'who', 'come', 'contact', 'Gang-du', 'cell', 'phone', 'call', 'Hyun-seo', 'who', 'somewhere', 'Seoul', 'sewar', 'system', 'apparently', 'being', 'kept', 'snack', 'beastie.It', 'strange', 'say', 'Host', 'will', 'remind', 'much', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'will', 'Godzilla', 'when', 'have', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'van', 'trying', 'band', 'together', 'sake', 'young', 'girl', 'comparison', 'inevitable', 'obvious', 'thing', 'complain', 'here', 'length', 'have', 'think', 'less', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'film', 'running', '1:59', 'South', 'Korea', 'audiences', 'expect', 'movies', 'run', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'what', 'one', 'biggest', 'blockbuster', 'South', 'Korean', 'movie', 'history', 'plus', 'side', 'computer', 'generated', 'monster', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'battle', 'monster', 'movie', 'one', 'Still', 'regardless', 'length', 'something', 'disconnect', 'set', 'up', 'pay', 'off', 'film', 'predictability', 'what', 'archer', 'running', 'will', 'surprise', 'film', 'work', 'comedy', 'mix', 'often', 'end', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'appropriate', 'However', 'things', 'considered', 'Host', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'fans', 'monster', 'movies', 'may', 'well', 'become', 'personal', 'favorite', 'particular', 'genre']",N/A

At the core of the film's untenable nightmare is a lone grieving family's defiance to seek and exact revenge on the monster, a seemingly indestructible, made-made mollusk-like giant creature borne of genetic (and perhaps viral) mutations that begins to terrorize revelers at a park on the steps of the ubiquitous Han River. But beyond the film's less than subtle jab at the (pointedly American) arrogance and abuse of authority that lead to the environmental disaster, the film is also a wry commentary on the culture of conformity and unquestioning deference to authority, as the survivors and first-hand witnesses to the monster's rampage are relegated to the role of quarantined victims, forcibly isolated from the general population for decontamination, subjected to inhuman diagnostic experimental procedures in the name of exploratory science, and systematically deprived of civil liberties and basic human rights under the amorphous rubric of national security. Deploying convenient, unsubstantiated (and insubstantiable) quack theories and misinformation through the media in order to exploit the victims' disorientation and cultural submissiveness to obfuscate the true nature of the threat, and in the process, transforming the monster's already real menace into an almost mythical bogeyman responsible for all of the indefinable plagues that afflict contemporary society, The Host serves as a trenchant and provocative satire on the dysfunctional geopolitics of anti-terrorism.",5,Smater than your average monster movie,1262736000,"01 6, 2010",2010,1878,"['Screened', 'slightly', 'more', 'halfway', 'mark', 'festival', 'Bong', 'Joon-ho', 'Host', 'particularly', 'refreshing', 'pause', 'mind', 'bending', 'aftermath', 'Inland', 'Empire', 'smart', 'offbeat', 'competent', 'horror', 'film', 'effortlessly', 'ingredients', 'well-crafted', 'monster', 'thriller', 'incisive', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'environmental', 'responsibility', 'cultural', 'arrogance', 'core', 'film', 'untenable', 'nightmare', 'lone', 'grieving', 'family', 'defiance', 'seek', 'exact', 'revenge', 'monster', 'seemingly', 'indestructible', 'made-made', 'mollusk-like', 'giant', 'creature', 'borne', 'genetic', 'perhaps', 'viral', 'mutations', 'terrorize', 'revelers', 'park', 'steps', 'ubiquitous', 'Han', 'River', 'film', 'less', 'subtle', 'jab', 'pointedly', 'American', 'arrogance', 'abuse', 'authority', 'lead', 'environmental', 'disaster', 'film', 'also', 'wry', 'commentary', 'culture', 'conformity', 'unquestioning', 'deference', 'authority', 'survivors', 'first-hand', 'witnesses', 'monster', 'rampage', 'are', 'relegated', 'role', 'quarantined', 'victims', 'forcibly', 'isolated', 'general', 'population', 'decontamination', 'subjected', 'inhuman', 'diagnostic', 'experimental', 'procedures', 'name', 'exploratory', 'science', 'systematically', 'deprived', 'civil', 'liberties', 'basic', 'human', 'rights', 'amorphous', 'rubric', 'national', 'security', 'Deploying', 'convenient', 'unsubstantiated', 'insubstantiable', 'quack', 'theories', 'misinformation', 'media', 'order', 'exploit', 'victims', 'disorientation', 'cultural', 'submissiveness', 'obfuscate', 'true', 'nature', 'threat', 'process', 'transforming', 'monster', 'already', 'real', 'menace', 'almost', 'mythical', 'bogeyman', 'responsible', 'indefinable', 'plagues', 'afflict', 'contemporary', 'society', 'Host', 'serves', 'trenchant', 'provocative', 'satire', 'dysfunctional', 'geopolitics', 'anti-terrorism']",N/A

1072023,ALND45MWBGUQS,B000PKG8SS,Lunar Boulevard,"[2, 2]","The Host is so fascinating to me because I'm typically not a big fan of monster and/or horror films. Too often I find them to be formulaic, overly graphic, weak on story, or simply ridiculous. This film curves everything you may expect from these types of flicks and the end result is absolutely thrilling.The story itself is one we've all all seen before: a mutated creature emerges from the depths and terrorizes a local community. That in and of itself is formulaic but the rest of the film is a completely different ride. The creature itself appears ten minutes into the film and appears in public in broad daylight. Right away you realize that this movie will take everything you know and expect about horror films and will twist them into something so much better. The next two hours are a fun ride, complete with drama, surprises, and plenty of humor (something I wasn't expecting but it works brilliantly and keeps the tone from becoming oppressively dark). Perhaps what makes this movie so engrossing are the family members themselves. Each one has their own unique personality and struggles; watching them come together is truly touching and you find yourself caring for these characters and rooting for them every step of the way. As the film progresses it becomes as much about the characters as it does the creature, something that I appreciate from films of this nature. The look of the film is gorgeous and the locations are simple yet memorable and the pacing is solid, moving at a swift pace while slowing down in the right places to allow you to catch your breath and learn more about the individual characters.It reminds me of a cross between Alien, Jaws, and District 9.

Who are these people who were enthralled with the film from the very beginning?  There were so many irritating points in the first 10 minutes that I wanted to turn the movie off but my husband convinced me to give it a chance.  I waited another 15 minutes before I decided enough was enough and went on to another dvd.  The audience  is immediately assaulted with a pompous old american bossing his asian underling around, ordering him to drain toxic chemicals down the sink because the bottles were covered in dust and he HATES dust.  The earnest young man questions the ethics of this directive and is taken to task by the stupid American.  Okay, obviously this movie is a modern take on Godzilla etal.  Americans are to blame for the pollution and resulting genetic deformity of this monster just like the atom bomb created Godzilla.  I can appreciate that being a huge fan of the original monster versions.  But this movie just couldn't carry it off.  Has no one learned from the 1998 remake of Godzilla?  Nothing can duplicate the genius of those old monster movies of the 50s (or was it 60s?) so please stop trying.We are introduced to a young girl in the schoolgirl uniform as the heroine (as with the original) but the father-daughter relationship kinda gave me the creeps.  The characters dubbed voices was for what purpose?  They did not dub badly enough for it to be a spoof.  From what I can gather, in the time I spent watching it, this film was a real monster movie with spoofing of the genre?  Great concept but poor execution (Scream is a better example).

It starts out being about a monster but it turns into a deeper message with the actions of mankind being the bigger monster. Watching ""The Host"" I felt like I was sitting there seeing something that was more than just a monster flick and probably because I was.The host is about a family that is torn apart by the events that a rampaging monster brings down on them but, the real story is about what they go through to stick together. The monster in this movie is just a side attraction. I enjoyed the mixture of comedy,drama,suspense,thrills, and chills the movie had. It played everything off extremely well. It has a nice balance with the Comedy moments and the Drama which made you laugh and then cry in the next scene.The one thing about this movie that made it work so well is that there's not really a solo character that your routing for to win. Your actually just rooting for the entire family and your hoping they get through everything okay.The only thing I disliked about the movie is that it had too many political undertones. U.S. and Korean relations are very heavy in this film as well as their own internal political struggles. Which is something that seems apparent in most Korean films. They always sneak in a political message but this one makes sure you get it. These parts of the movie are what take away from the ""Monster"" being the true nemesis.  This movie works though because you usually wouldn't expect to see this type of context in a monster film so it's surprising.Overall this is a good 4/5 movie.

Its not bad at all; at least it has something original to say instead of the usual horror crap Hollywood puts out lately.Very atmospheric and comical at times, the films deals with a monstrous mutant creature that appears out of nowhere, goes on a rampage on the small populace in a park somewhere in South Korea, and snatches a young girl to be devoured later in his lair. Her family, which includes her well meaning but slow-witted narcoleptic father, her champion archer aunt, her businessman uncle with a quick temper, and the grandfather who tries to hold the family unit together in this ordeal, search for her. They make up the heart of the film, and this element elevates ""The Host"" from other movies. Like ""Alien"", ""The Descent"", ""Jaws"" and other films, it allows you to get to know and care for these desperate people and build some sort of sympathy for them in the middle of the creature's chaos.The creature's appearance, which the local government may've had a hand in creating unknowingly, leads the country to declare a quarantine, believing it carries some sort of virus. This gets into SARS - type territory. The government and scientific officials are all yes-men, corrupt and simple-minded to the last.The beast, which looks like some type of lizard/shark abomination, doesnt look all that terrifying in my opinion but it is fun to watch regardless, and its movements do look a bit realistic.

1072029,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B000PKG8SS,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[2, 2]","I've been eyeing ""The Host"" for years, having heard it was the inspiration for several other ""kaiju""-style monster films since, most notably ""Cloverfield,"" but it took me years before I was finally able to make the comparison myself.  Although the two have some similarities - undersea creature mutated by modern living returns to ravage modern civilization - you could say the same thing about Godzilla. Fortunately ""The Host"" stands quite well on its own.It all begins with an urban myth.  An American military pathologist (Scott Wilson) supposedly dumped 480 bottles of dusty formaldehyde down the drain into the Han River. The facts behind this case have been monstrously distorted, just like the twisted beast in ""The Host,"" but that doesn't stop the movie from telling a great tale.  The film implies that ""the host"" country (South Korea) is being taken advantage of the United States.But ""The Host"" is as much a film about (Korean) family values as it is about monsters.  The family in question is led by patriarch Hee-Bong (Byeon Hee-bong), his three children: national medalist archer Nam-joo (Bae Doona), former activist Nami-il (Park Hae-il), dim-witted snack-bar assistant Park Gang-du (Song Kang-ho); and Park's daughter and Hyun-seo (Ko Ah-seong).To American audiences Park, who is comically narcoleptic, appears as a washed-up man-child dependent on his father's income.  But Park is also a member of a tightly meshed family unit and therefore the closest to his father despite his economic woes.  When Hyun-seo is kidnapped by the creature as a future meal, they band together to do what the government won't.Making matters worse is the suspicion that the beast is infectious and therefore Park, who came into contact with the creature, is a vector (another ""host""), evoking SARS, avian flu, and ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms."" Intercut between government suppression and the family's grief are scenes of suspicion among the civilian populace.  Masks are worn.  People who appear sick are shunned. And the media feasts on their fear.American audiences are likely to be turned off by the broad caricatures of incompetence and grief.  Park in particular is difficult to like. THE SPOILER: This is the kind of movie where a horrific lobotomy scene is played for laughs.Director Bong Joon-ho is familiar with all the typical movie tropes and tweaks them.  He introduces several Chekov Guns - Will Nam-joo finally make a critical bow shot after freezing up at the Olympics?  Will Nami-il use his guerilla tactics for good?  Will Park save the last bullet for the monster? - and then promptly teases the audience by having each character utterly fail, at first, to do what we expect.Like the other tropes that are averted in ""The Host,"" the creature is hidden for a few minutes and then come barreling onto screen, in full daylight, amidst a crowd. This fact becomes a sore point with the military--the creature does nothing to hide and yet the government can't, or won't, find it.  The beast itself is a water pollution nightmare, part-tadpole, part-deep sea fish.  Milky white orbs serve as eyes, vestigial limbs jut at odd angles, and the monster lopes painfully on the land.  It is the sum of all our fears: our civilized world is so corrupt that even something as natural as sharing a drink at a watering hole has been violated.""The Host"" has its flaws, but like the titular monster, it is far more powerful as a symbol of our worst fears than as a mere monster movie.",5,The Perfect Host,1344729600,"08 12, 2012",2012,3484,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'eyeing', 'Host', 'years', 'having', 'heard', 'was', 'inspiration', 'several', 'other', 'kaiju', '-style', 'monster', 'films', 'most', 'notably', 'Cloverfield', 'took', 'years', 'was', 'finally', 'able', 'make', 'comparison', 'two', 'have', 'similarities', 'undersea', 'creature', 'mutated', 'modern', 'living', 'returns', 'ravage', 'modern', 'civilization', 'could', 'say', 'same', 'thing', 'Godzilla', 'Fortunately', 'Host', 'quite', 'well', 'own.It', 'urban', 'myth', 'American', 'military', 'pathologist', 'Scott', 'Wilson', 'supposedly', 'dumped', '480', 'bottles', 'dusty', 'formaldehyde', 'down', 'drain', 'Han', 'River', 'facts', 'case', 'have', 'been', 'monstrously', 'distorted', 'just', 'twisted', 'beast', 'Host', ""n't"", 'stop', 'movie', 'telling', 'great', 'tale', 'film', 'host', 'country', 'South', 'Korea', 'being', 'taken', 'advantage', 'United', 'States.But', 'Host', 'as', 'much', 'film', 'Korean', 'family', 'values', 'monsters', 'family', 'question', 'led', 'patriarch', 'Hee-Bong', 'Byeon', 'Hee-bong', 'three', 'children', 'national', 'medalist', 'Nam-joo', 'Bae', 'Doona', 'former', 'activist', 'Nami-il', 'Park', 'Hae-il', 'dim-witted', 'snack-bar', 'assistant', 'Park', 'Gang-du', 'Song', 'Kang-ho', 'Park', 'daughter', 'Hyun-seo', 'Ko', 'Ah-seong', '.To', 'American', 'audiences', 'Park', 'who', 'comically', 'narcoleptic', 'washed-up', 'man-child', 'dependent', 'father', 'income', 'Park', 'also', 'member', 'tightly', 'meshed', 'family', 'unit', 'therefore', 'closest', 'father', 'economic', 'woes', 'When', 'Hyun-seo', 'kidnapped', 'creature', 'future', 'meal', 'band', 'together', 'do', 'what', 'government', ""won't.Making"", 'matters', 'worse', 'suspicion', 'beast', 'infectious', 'therefore', 'Park', 'who', 'came', 'contact', 'creature', 'vector', 'host', 'evoking', 'SARS', 'avian', 'flu', 'Beast', '20,000', 'Fathoms', 'Intercut', 'government', 'suppression', 'family', 'grief', 'are', 'scenes', 'suspicion', 'civilian', 'populace', 'Masks', 'are', 'worn', 'People', 'who', 'appear', 'sick', 'are', 'shunned', 'media', 'feasts', 'fear.American', 'audiences', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'broad', 'caricatures', 'incompetence', 'grief', 'Park', 'particular', 'difficult', 'like', 'SPOILER', 'kind', 'movie', 'where', 'horrific', 'lobotomy', 'scene', 'played', 'laughs.Director', 'Bong', 'Joon-ho', 'familiar', 'typical', 'movie', 'tropes', 'tweaks', 'several', 'Chekov', 'Guns', 'Will', 'Nam-joo', 'finally', 'make', 'critical', 'bow', 'shot', 'freezing', 'up', 'Olympics', 'Will', 'Nami-il', 'guerilla', 'tactics', 'good', 'Will', 'Park', 'save', 'last', 'bullet', 'monster', 'then', 'promptly', 'audience', 'having', 'character', 'utterly', 'fail', 'first', 'do', 'what', 'expect.Like', 'other', 'tropes', 'are', 'averted', 'Host', 'creature', 'hidden', 'few', 'minutes', 'then', 'come', 'barreling', 'screen', 'full', 'daylight', 'crowd', 'fact', 'sore', 'point', 'military', 'creature', 'nothing', 'hide', 'yet', 'government', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'beast', 'water', 'pollution', 'nightmare', 'part-tadpole', 'part-deep', 'sea', 'fish', 'Milky', 'white', 'orbs', 'serve', 'eyes', 'vestigial', 'limbs', 'jut', 'odd', 'angles', 'monster', 'painfully', 'land', 'sum', 'fears', 'civilized', 'world', 'so', 'corrupt', 'even', 'something', 'as', 'natural', 'sharing', 'drink', 'watering', 'hole', 'been', 'violated', 'Host', 'flaws', 'titular', 'monster', 'far', 'more', 'powerful', 'symbol', 'worst', 'fears', 'mere', 'monster', 'movie']",N/A

1072032,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000PKG8SS,mirasreviews,"[2, 4]","""The Host"" is an unusual, farcical monster movie that became the highest-grossing South Korean film ever. Inspired by the recent SARS panic and an incident of improper disposal of chemicals on a U.S. military base in South Korea, director and co-writer Joon-ho Bong has created an anti-authoritarian polemic exploring the implications of paranoia and regimentation in a free society, with a lovable dysfunctional family at its heart. ""The Host"" doesn't confine its parody to the bad guys. It skewers every stereotype it introduces, most obviously action movie heroes and the Korean model of order and efficiency.Unbeknownst to the citizens of Seoul, toxic chemicals dumped by an American scientist has spawned a strange creature in the Han River. It emerges from the water one day to terrorize and consume picnickers on the river bank. Gang-du Park (Kang-ho Song), the slacker, narcoleptic son of a snack food vendor, loses track of his daughter Hyun-seo (Ah-sung Ko) in the hysteria, and she is carried off by the monster. Grieving families of victims are quarantined for fear they have acquired some contagion from the monster. After a phone call from Hyun-soe claims that she is trapped in a sewer, Gang-du, grandpa Hie-bong (Hie-bong Byeon), disillusioned drunkard uncle Nam-il (Hae-il Park), and archery medalist aunt Nam-joo (Du-na Bae) break out of quarantine and to rescue Hyun-soe.Unlike most monster movies, ""The Host"" shows us the monster up front. It's an ugly beast, but its grace and acrobatics make it very watchable. ""The Host"" doesn't try to be menacing or suspenseful, and it rejects many predictable monster movie cliches. It tends more toward allegorical farce than action. The family is searching for Hyun-seo; the authorities are looking for the fugitive family; and everyone is hunting the monster. Yet the bigger menace is misinformation wielded by fear-mongering bureaucrats to restrict the lives of the citizenry. Some scenes overstay their welcome, and ""The Host"" runs too long, but its funny and entertaining if you like farce and don't mind camp. In Korean with optional subtitles.The DVD (Magnolia 2007 single disc): Bonus features are deleted scenes, deleted news clips, one featurette and an audio commentary. ""Director Bong Joon-Ho's Reflections"" (5 1/2 min) is, oddly, a series of apologies by the director to the actors whose scenes were cut, who were unrecognizable, who suffered discomfort, etc. There is an audio commentary by writer-director Joon-ho Bong and English friend Tony Raines. The commentary is in English, in interview format, with Raines asking Bong questions about the film. This works well and produces a constant commentary. They discuss actors, settings, characters, themes, the monster, plot points, and more. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish.

1072037,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B000PKG8SS,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[10, 13]","In January of 2005, an American civilian employee at the mortuary of a U.S. military base in Seoul, South Korea, was sentenced to a six-month prison sentence for ordering subordinates to dump 227 liters of contaminated formaldehyde into a sewage drain, that flowed directly the Han River, the prime source of drinking water for the city's twelve million inhabitants. While the US military insisted there was no threat to public health, environmentalists worried that the toxic chemical would be deadly to marine life and could lead to increased incidences of cancer among humans. The case generated a great deal of local outrage including anti-American protests calling for the withdrawal of American troops.Bong Joon-ho's critically acclaimed international hit film ""The Host"" begins by recreating this scene almost word for word based on news reports. While the monstrous consequences he draws from this event are straight out of the pages of comic books and science fiction films, this film is really about the true victims of such environmental carelessness: the locals, who live close to the river, and who are powerless to protect themselves and their families in the face of nameless threats they are exposed to as a result of the carelessness, shortsightedness, ineptitude and even deception of the government, military, and industry.The film works on a number of levels, both as a family comedy and drama, a really scary freakout film and a conspiracy thriller, a showcase for ingenious use of animation, and even, I think, a serious meditation on the nature of families and especially on the role of fatherhood, but I want to focus briefly on the fact it belongs to a venerable (well, that's not exactly the right word), .... a fairly long and choppy tradition of ""toxic monster"" movies whose most iconic exemplar is Godzilla. The basic premise of such films is that a monster is created or awoken by human carelessness or greed manifested in the form of toxic dumping, nuclear testing, and other arrogant forms of intervention into the course of nature - and this monster goes on to terrorize the locals. The implication is, of course, that the monster is us: that human beings bring upon themselves their own destruction.Early in the film, in response to dubious military claims regarding a new and unseen threat that compounds the danger that had emerged from the toxic depths of the Han River, the elderly Hie-bong shrugs and states that ""if the government says so, we have to accept it."" In the end, and after an intelligently plotted and very funny and thrilling ride, it is this complacent and passive attitude that is most challenged by this film. The filmmakers suggest that such people (i.e. all of us) are at bottom mostly concerned not about big issues but about our families, our friends, and our way of life. ""The Host"" is a hopeful and deeply humanistic film in its portrayal of a few people who out of love are willing to face up to environmental terrors they did not have a hand in creating. Even where we do not care for or have the capacity to understand the issues related to the ""environment"" in the abstract, this film suggests, it is enough that we care about each other and about the places we call home, and if enough of us care enough to refuse to be complacent with the voices telling us there is nothing to be done, we can individually and collectively make some kind of difference.",5,An excellent Korean thriller about a toxic monster created by carelessness,1187395200,"08 18, 2007",2007,3420,"['January', '2005', 'American', 'civilian', 'employee', 'mortuary', 'U.S.', 'military', 'base', 'Seoul', 'South', 'Korea', 'was', 'sentenced', 'six-month', 'prison', 'sentence', 'ordering', 'subordinates', 'dump', '227', 'liters', 'contaminated', 'formaldehyde', 'sewage', 'drain', 'flowed', 'directly', 'Han', 'River', 'prime', 'source', 'drinking', 'water', 'city', 'twelve', 'million', 'inhabitants', 'US', 'military', 'insisted', 'was', 'threat', 'public', 'health', 'environmentalists', 'worried', 'toxic', 'chemical', 'would', 'be', 'deadly', 'marine', 'life', 'could', 'lead', 'increased', 'incidences', 'cancer', 'humans', 'case', 'generated', 'great', 'deal', 'local', 'outrage', 'including', 'anti-American', 'protests', 'calling', 'withdrawal', 'American', 'Joon-ho', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'international', 'hit', 'film', 'Host', 'recreating', 'scene', 'almost', 'word', 'word', 'based', 'news', 'reports', 'monstrous', 'consequences', 'event', 'are', 'straight', 'pages', 'comic', 'books', 'science', 'fiction', 'films', 'film', 'really', 'true', 'victims', 'such', 'environmental', 'carelessness', 'locals', 'who', 'live', 'close', 'river', 'who', 'are', 'powerless', 'protect', 'families', 'face', 'nameless', 'threats', 'are', 'exposed', 'result', 'carelessness', 'shortsightedness', 'ineptitude', 'even', 'deception', 'government', 'military', 'industry.The', 'film', 'number', 'levels', 'family', 'comedy', 'drama', 'really', 'scary', 'freakout', 'film', 'conspiracy', 'thriller', 'showcase', 'ingenious', 'use', 'animation', 'even', 'think', 'serious', 'meditation', 'nature', 'families', 'especially', 'role', 'fatherhood', 'want', 'focus', 'briefly', 'fact', 'venerable', 'well', 'not', 'exactly', 'right', 'word', 'fairly', 'long', 'choppy', 'tradition', 'toxic', 'monster', 'movies', 'most', 'iconic', 'exemplar', 'Godzilla', 'basic', 'premise', 'such', 'films', 'monster', 'created', 'awoken', 'human', 'carelessness', 'greed', 'manifested', 'form', 'toxic', 'dumping', 'nuclear', 'testing', 'other', 'arrogant', 'forms', 'intervention', 'course', 'nature', 'monster', 'terrorize', 'locals', 'implication', 'course', 'monster', 'human', 'beings', 'bring', 'own', 'destruction.Early', 'film', 'response', 'dubious', 'military', 'claims', 'regarding', 'new', 'unseen', 'threat', 'danger', 'had', 'emerged', 'toxic', 'depths', 'Han', 'River', 'elderly', 'Hie-bong', 'shrugs', 'states', 'government', 'so', 'have', 'accept', 'end', 'intelligently', 'plotted', 'very', 'funny', 'thrilling', 'ride', 'complacent', 'passive', 'attitude', 'most', 'challenged', 'film', 'filmmakers', 'suggest', 'such', 'people', 'i.e', 'are', 'bottom', 'mostly', 'concerned', 'not', 'big', 'issues', 'families', 'friends', 'way', 'life', 'Host', 'hopeful', 'deeply', 'humanistic', 'film', 'portrayal', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'are', 'willing', 'face', 'up', 'environmental', 'terrors', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'hand', 'creating', 'Even', 'where', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'have', 'capacity', 'understand', 'issues', 'related', 'environment', 'abstract', 'film', 'enough', 'care', 'other', 'places', 'call', 'home', 'enough', 'care', 'enough', 'refuse', 'be', 'complacent', 'voices', 'telling', 'nothing', 'be', 'done', 'can', 'individually', 'collectively', 'make', 'kind', 'difference']",N/A

In between all of the slight cracks towards governments and frantic monster mayhem, The Host is a smart and frequently entertaining blast that surprisingly manages to deliver like no monster movie has before in years.  The CGI effects are mostly great, and the slight moments of humor offer a nice change of pace as well.  The only real flaw of The Host is that the film is too long for its own good.

It's critically acclaimed and also well received by audience world-wide.  The local newspaper stressed us to watch the movie before it's butchered by Hollywood.  So, I did just that.  Perhaps, I went to the cinema with over the top expectation and reality never managed to match that.  Yes, I gave credit to where it's due.  This movie came about because of one actual incident that happened in South Korea where poisonous pollutants were dumped into the Han River.  In other words, The Host was actually not an entertainment movie per say but a protest movie.  Surprise, surprise, the media & the Americans were branded as ""villains"" of the movie for building up a paranoia akin to the SARS virus that broke up in Asia few years ago and also of the Americans endeavouring to cover up the ""problem"" that it triggered at the first place, which was rather similar to Hollywood version of Godzilla storyline.  The Host was patchy at best and there were funny moments too.  Having said that, the focal point of the movie was a simple Korean Park family that simply went around living their own lives until they were interrupted by this monster that was a metaphor for the intervening factor in Korea.  Nobody would take heed of the ordeal & believed what they had to say about their missing family member until they had to resort to one another for support.  Don't expect a linear progression of storyline where the monster would be slain and everybody would live happily ever after.

While those may be a fun diversion (I never really got into them, personally), it's a little hard to take them seriously. The Host makes the genre more accessible to a wide audience, beginning with the titular monster.As opposed to a city-smashing giant, the monster in The Host is about the size of an elephant (maybe a little bigger). And it looks like a giant mutated fish, not a person in a suit. The result is a monster that is more believable, and therefore one you can actually take seriously. The special effects used to bring the creature to life are clever and remarkably convincing.Along with a scaled-down monster, the story is also smaller than most monster movies. The film focuses on a single family trying to rescue a young girl from the moster's lair. Without giving away much of the story, I will say that The Host is a wild ride, both a fun piece of entertainment and a compelling family drama.The blu-ray is fairly packed with bonus material, including a lot of making-of features showing the design and creation of the monster. One that I found particularly interesting shows scenes from the movie at various stages of completion. In one run-through there is no creature at all, just actors running along the river's edge. In the next, a wireframe monster crudely lumbers after them. Then textures are added, and so on, until you finally see the finished scene. There is also a very funny retrospective on shooting in the sewers.

I can understand including a dubbed version for 1) the educationally-challenged who can't stand to (or are unable to) read subtitles, 2) the culturally-challenged who can't stand listening to foreign languages, or 3) the artistically-challenged who don't understand how much is lost when the voices of the real actors are replaced by Grade-F ""voice talents"" with no acting ability.What I can't understand is why they would arbitrarily delete the English subtitles from this version.

I probably lost that idea in the many, many comparisons that have been made to Jaws (which make no sense at all to me). All the hyperbole (""one of the greatest monster movies ever made!"") aside, however, The Host is an amusing little flick, certainly capable of holding a viewer's attention for a couple of hours.The plot: after a number of toxic chemicals were ordered dumped into the Han River by a neglectful army higher-up (this part of the story, by the way, actually happened, though no giant monsters have yet cropped up), something very large and very hungry started growing in the Han River. One day, it wakes up and decides it's hungry-- and my, don't those folks on the shore look appetizing? So it goes to have itself a meal, and takes a snack for later-- Hyun-seo (Ah-sung Il in her first screen role). Her father, Gang-du (Lady Vengenace's Kang-ho Song), pursues the monster to no avail. Later, at the memorial service for the monster's victims, Gang-Du, his siblings Nam-joo (Linda Linda Linda's Du-na Bae, who's rapidly becoming Korea's It Girl) and Nam-il (Hae-il Park, recently of Memories of Murder), and his father Hie-bong (The Scent of Chrysanthemums' Hie-bong Byeon), into custody... after which they get a frantic call from Hyun-seo, who's still alive and hiding in the creature's lair. The family must escape custody and find Hyun-seo, helped and hindered by any number of odd characters. And, of course, the monster itself.Forget Juno-- The Host is the little movie that could. Nominated for seven Grand Bells (the Korean Oscars, essentially) including Best Film, it won two (Best Director and Best Editing), and estimates say that almost 20% of South Korea's entire population went to see the movie in theaters. Once it got out, it went on a festival rampage, taking awards at the Saturns, the Asia-Pacific Film Festival, the Asian Awards, and Fantasporto, among others. Needless to say, it also shattered South Korean box office records, taking in over ten billion (yes, with a B) won during its theatrical run. (To put it in perspective, that's about ten and a half million bucks... on six hundred seventeen screens.) But you have to ask yourself, given that the unbearably awful Titanic is still the top-grossing movie in American history, whether it's any good.And it is. The script is sharp, the acting is dynamic (and very tight; many of these performers have worked together on multiple movies in the past), the creature effects are some of the best I've seen in recent years. It's not a great film, by any means; it's a simple, straightforward monster movie that's got some added depth with the family angle-- but it's a lot of fun, and it's a movie that does stand up very well to rewatching, mostly because it's predictable without being boring and/or stupid.

All horror films work within a framework and the most successful of them are original within that framework, not by busting it up.  It is like a competitor in a high diving contest.  If you completely alter form you will get a damning grade.One reviewer described this as a satire.  I think he is mistaking comical elements for satire; the overall form of this film is definitely not satirical.  It is definitely trying to stay within the bounds of the horror film while trying to stretch some of its limits.  For instance, one of the rules in monster movies is that you don't show the monster too soon or too well.  But here the monster is shown only a few minutes into the film and then with great clarity.  You see exactly what it looks like almost as soon as you see it for the first time.  I wasn't too troubled by this because the monster was interestingly and uniquely portrayed.  I was a bit more bothered by the frequent injection of farce (which is what I think the reviewer I mentioned before mistook for satire).  I think comedy properly timed can do a great deal to ease tension and make for a better film, but at times this film almost degenerated into slapstick.  Another traditional element -- and one with which it clashes because of the farce, which almost seems to promise a happy ending -- is the idea of winning.  Every monster movie has to end with a sense of a win.  Few really great monster movies end with all the principle characters dead.  Here most of the characters survive, but the two we care most for in the course of the narrative do not.  At the end of the film it didn't, to me, feel like a ""win.""  I felt that the monster won.Still, there were a lot of riveting moments in the film.  The locale in Seoul was truly creepy and eerie.  The camera work was simply breathtaking and was as important in establishing the mood of the film as the locale or the special effects (it was shot in high def video instead of film, a practice embraced not only by a number of television series like BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, but more and more movies).  The monster itself was simply amazing.  I wasn't completely thrilled with its appearance, but there is no questioning how convincing it looked.  It was perhaps the most impressive large monster (except perhaps for Peter Jackson's Kong) that I've seen in a movie.Still, despite the good things, the persistent farcical elements and the ""feel bad"" ending kept me from liking this as much as I would have liked.  With some tweaking, it could have become a classic.",3,"Extremely interesting horror film, though perhaps a bit too original for its own good",1187568000,"08 20, 2007",2007,2653,"['were', 'lot', 'things', 'really', 'loved', 'movie', 'fair', 'number', 'did', 'not', 'horror', 'films', 'work', 'framework', 'most', 'successful', 'are', 'original', 'framework', 'not', 'busting', 'up', 'competitor', 'high', 'diving', 'contest', 'completely', 'alter', 'form', 'will', 'get', 'damning', 'grade.One', 'reviewer', 'described', 'satire', 'think', 'mistaking', 'comical', 'elements', 'satire', 'overall', 'form', 'film', 'definitely', 'not', 'satirical', 'definitely', 'trying', 'stay', 'bounds', 'horror', 'film', 'trying', 'stretch', 'limits', 'instance', 'one', 'rules', 'monster', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'monster', 'too', 'soon', 'too', 'well', 'here', 'monster', 'shown', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'then', 'great', 'clarity', 'see', 'exactly', 'what', 'like', 'almost', 'as', 'soon', 'see', 'first', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'troubled', 'monster', 'was', 'interestingly', 'uniquely', 'portrayed', 'was', 'bit', 'more', 'bothered', 'frequent', 'injection', 'farce', 'what', 'think', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'mistook', 'satire', 'think', 'comedy', 'properly', 'timed', 'can', 'do', 'great', 'deal', 'ease', 'tension', 'make', 'better', 'film', 'times', 'film', 'almost', 'degenerated', 'slapstick', 'traditional', 'element', 'one', 'farce', 'almost', 'promise', 'happy', 'ending', 'idea', 'winning', 'monster', 'movie', 'end', 'sense', 'win', 'Few', 'really', 'great', 'monster', 'movies', 'end', 'principle', 'characters', 'dead', 'Here', 'most', 'characters', 'survive', 'two', 'care', 'most', 'course', 'narrative', 'do', 'not', 'end', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'win', 'felt', 'monster', 'won.Still', 'were', 'lot', 'riveting', 'moments', 'film', 'locale', 'Seoul', 'was', 'truly', 'creepy', 'eerie', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'simply', 'breathtaking', 'was', 'important', 'establishing', 'mood', 'film', 'locale', 'special', 'effects', 'was', 'shot', 'high', 'def', 'video', 'instead', 'film', 'practice', 'embraced', 'not', 'only', 'number', 'television', 'series', 'BATTLESTAR', 'GALACTICA', 'FRIDAY', 'NIGHT', 'LIGHTS', 'more', 'more', 'movies', 'monster', 'was', 'simply', 'amazing', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'thrilled', 'appearance', 'questioning', 'how', 'convincing', 'looked', 'was', 'perhaps', 'most', 'impressive', 'large', 'monster', 'perhaps', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'Kong', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie.Still', 'good', 'things', 'persistent', 'farcical', 'elements', 'feel', 'bad', 'ending', 'kept', 'liking', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'tweaking', 'could', 'have', 'become', 'classic']",N/A

1072064,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000PKG8SS,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 3]","***1/2Reportedly the biggest box office hit in South Korean movie history, ""The Host"" is a fun monster-movie parody that is also a touching family drama and an indictment of the evils of modern science at one and the same time.The trouble begins when a U.S. Army mortician orders his reluctant lab assistant to pour mass quantities of spoiled formaldehyde down the drain directly into Seoul's Han River.  In no time flat, the toxic waste has mutated into a massive sea creature that can live both on land and in water and which devours any hapless human unfortunate enough to wander onto its path.  It also captures certain individuals and drags them to a sewer where he keeps them for later feeding.  One such victim is a young girl named Hyun-seo, whose family members - a kindly grandfather, an aunt and an uncle, and her own childlike father - after receiving no assistance from the governmental authorities, are forced to make a desperate attempt on their own to rescue her.Directed by ""Memories of Murder""'s Bong Joon-ho, ""The Host"" is not a laugh-a-minute parody in the scattershot mold of the ""Airplane,"" ""Naked Gun,"" ""Scary Movie"" franchises.  Instead, it mocks the conventions of its genre while at the same time treating those conventions with seriousness and respect.  The characters may act in ways that are silly and goofy, but the threat posed by the creature is always real, so that we laugh at the same time we are awaiting the next suspense-filled jolt to come our way.The movie, in many ways, is really more about the dynamics of this one family than it is about a city coping with a man-eating monster.  Of particular interest is Hyun-seo's father, Gang-du, a kindhearted man who lives with his dad, sleeps most of the day at the store they run, and seems never to have fully grown into adulthood.  His idea of good parenting skills is playing video games with his daughter while handing her a freshly opened can of beer.  This puts him in direct conflict with his younger brother and sister, who continually berate Gang-du for being an irresponsible parent.  It is only in the midst of an intense crisis such as the one the family is facing that Gang-du finds the fortitude, courage and maturity he needs to be a true father to his daughter.As in most films of this nature, the scientists and governmental authorities in ""The Host"" are viewed with suspicion, if not downright hostility.  They spend most of their time lying to the general public in an attempt to hide their own inadequacies and incompetence.  The Americans come in for a particular black eye in this film, which prompts one to wonder just how favorably the United States government is viewed by the people (or at least the filmmakers) of South Korea.The performances are good, though ""The Host"" might have been a better film with a few minutes shaved off its running time. As it is, it runs a little long for a movie of this type, with most of the best laughs occurring in the front portion of the film.  It also has a tendency to take itself just a bit too seriously in its final half hour, blunting its satiric edge somewhat as a consequence.Still, this is a clever, entertaining film with cool special effects and an appealingly self-mocking tone.",3,a cult movie in the making,1189900800,"09 16, 2007",2007,3238,"['***1/2Reportedly', 'biggest', 'box', 'office', 'hit', 'South', 'Korean', 'movie', 'history', 'Host', 'fun', 'monster-movie', 'parody', 'also', 'touching', 'family', 'drama', 'indictment', 'evils', 'modern', 'science', 'one', 'same', 'time.The', 'trouble', 'when', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'mortician', 'orders', 'reluctant', 'lab', 'assistant', 'pour', 'mass', 'quantities', 'spoiled', 'formaldehyde', 'down', 'drain', 'directly', 'Seoul', 'Han', 'River', 'time', 'flat', 'toxic', 'waste', 'mutated', 'massive', 'sea', 'creature', 'can', 'live', 'land', 'water', 'hapless', 'human', 'unfortunate', 'enough', 'wander', 'path', 'also', 'certain', 'individuals', 'drags', 'sewer', 'where', 'later', 'feeding', 'One', 'such', 'victim', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Hyun-seo', 'family', 'members', 'kindly', 'grandfather', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'own', 'childlike', 'father', 'receiving', 'assistance', 'governmental', 'authorities', 'are', 'forced', 'make', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'own', 'rescue', 'her.Directed', 'Memories', 'Murder', 'Bong', 'Joon-ho', 'Host', 'not', 'laugh-a-minute', 'parody', 'scattershot', 'mold', 'Airplane', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'Instead', 'conventions', 'genre', 'same', 'time', 'treating', 'conventions', 'seriousness', 'respect', 'characters', 'may', 'act', 'ways', 'are', 'silly', 'goofy', 'threat', 'posed', 'creature', 'always', 'real', 'so', 'laugh', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'awaiting', 'next', 'suspense-filled', 'jolt', 'come', 'way.The', 'movie', 'many', 'ways', 'really', 'more', 'dynamics', 'one', 'family', 'city', 'coping', 'man-eating', 'monster', 'particular', 'interest', 'Hyun-seo', 'father', 'Gang-du', 'kindhearted', 'man', 'who', 'dad', 'most', 'day', 'store', 'run', 'never', 'have', 'fully', 'grown', 'adulthood', 'idea', 'good', 'parenting', 'skills', 'playing', 'video', 'games', 'daughter', 'handing', 'freshly', 'opened', 'can', 'beer', 'direct', 'conflict', 'younger', 'brother', 'sister', 'who', 'continually', 'berate', 'Gang-du', 'being', 'irresponsible', 'parent', 'only', 'midst', 'intense', 'crisis', 'such', 'one', 'family', 'facing', 'Gang-du', 'fortitude', 'courage', 'maturity', 'be', 'true', 'father', 'daughter.As', 'most', 'films', 'nature', 'scientists', 'governmental', 'authorities', 'Host', 'are', 'viewed', 'suspicion', 'not', 'downright', 'hostility', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'lying', 'general', 'public', 'attempt', 'hide', 'own', 'inadequacies', 'incompetence', 'Americans', 'come', 'particular', 'black', 'eye', 'film', 'one', 'wonder', 'just', 'how', 'favorably', 'United', 'States', 'government', 'viewed', 'people', 'least', 'filmmakers', 'South', 'Korea.The', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'Host', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'film', 'few', 'minutes', 'shaved', 'off', 'running', 'time', 'little', 'long', 'movie', 'type', 'most', 'best', 'laughs', 'occurring', 'front', 'portion', 'film', 'also', 'tendency', 'take', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'seriously', 'final', 'half', 'hour', 'blunting', 'satiric', 'edge', 'somewhat', 'consequence.Still', 'clever', 'entertaining', 'film', 'cool', 'special', 'effects', 'appealingly', 'self-mocking', 'tone']",N/A

It skipped from here to there with little connection between scenes.  It was hard to follow and dubbed poorly.  The only positive note to it was that the monster was done with some very decent FX, looking like a carp with legs or some kind of mudskipper gone wrong.The film starts with the dumping of some very old formaldehyde down the drain and into the river.  What happens from this is our large and unfriendly mutated carp monster.  One sunny day, the monster jumps out of the river and wreaks havoc on the people enjoying a day by the water.  Some he eats and some he takes back to his ""den"" for later consumption.  Among those taken to the den is a young girl whose family won't give up on her.  (although there is a hilarious mourning scene where they all thrash around on the floor in front of her picture tacked up among the dead from the grisly attack)There's also a virus associated with the monster, and the government starts to spray people and takes one member of the girl's family into isolation to attempt to figure out the virus, since he seems to have no effect from it.  Meanwhile, the creature roams the sewers, and renegade bands descend into the sewers in an attempt to catch it, including the little girls aunt with her bow and arrow (she's recently been in an archery contest where she froze up at the critical moment).Though the monster is good, the movie makes little sense and there's a lot of scenes that ""stretch"" out a little too long.  I watched the movie with six other people and none of us could quite figure out what was going on.  It's an entirely different mindset from American movies.  It's a movie that will have to be watched more than once to figure it all out, if you have the inclination to watch it again.  I don't.  I just didn't think it was good enough for a second viewing.  My advice is to rent, not buy, and if you are really into Japanese films you will most likely love this movie more than I did.",2,Japanese horror film falls short,1196035200,"11 26, 2007",2007,2067,"[""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'many', 'fans', 'Japanese', 'film', 'art', 'will', 'disagree', 'film', 'made', 'little', 'sense', 'skipped', 'here', 'little', 'connection', 'scenes', 'was', 'hard', 'follow', 'dubbed', 'poorly', 'only', 'positive', 'note', 'was', 'monster', 'was', 'done', 'very', 'decent', 'FX', 'looking', 'carp', 'legs', 'kind', 'mudskipper', 'gone', 'wrong.The', 'film', 'dumping', 'very', 'old', 'formaldehyde', 'down', 'drain', 'river', 'What', 'large', 'unfriendly', 'mutated', 'carp', 'monster', 'One', 'sunny', 'day', 'monster', 'river', 'wreaks', 'havoc', 'people', 'enjoying', 'day', 'water', 'back', 'den', 'later', 'consumption', 'taken', 'den', 'young', 'girl', 'family', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'hilarious', 'mourning', 'scene', 'where', 'thrash', 'floor', 'front', 'picture', 'tacked', 'up', 'dead', 'grisly', 'attack', 'also', 'virus', 'associated', 'monster', 'government', 'spray', 'people', 'one', 'member', 'girl', 'family', 'isolation', 'attempt', 'figure', 'out', 'virus', 'have', 'effect', 'Meanwhile', 'creature', 'sewers', 'renegade', 'bands', 'descend', 'sewers', 'attempt', 'catch', 'including', 'little', 'girls', 'aunt', 'bow', 'arrow', 'recently', 'been', 'archery', 'contest', 'where', 'froze', 'up', 'critical', 'moment', 'monster', 'good', 'movie', 'little', 'sense', 'lot', 'scenes', 'stretch', 'out', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'watched', 'movie', 'six', 'other', 'people', 'none', 'could', 'quite', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'entirely', 'different', 'mindset', 'American', 'movies', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'be', 'watched', 'more', 'once', 'figure', 'out', 'have', 'inclination', 'watch', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'second', 'viewing', 'advice', 'rent', 'not', 'buy', 'are', 'really', 'Japanese', 'films', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'love', 'movie', 'more', 'did']",N/A

1072072,A2TCHXH4SIN2OF,B000PKG8SS,"Severian ""Severian""","[3, 5]","*** Spoilers Below!!!***""The Host"" begins briskly enough with a great looking monster wreaking havoc in a public park in Seoul. The creature kidnaps a schoolgirl and the girl's oddball dysfunctional family is eventually forced to resort to self help to attempt to rescue the girl because the authorities are uninterested, incompetent, and / or malevolent. This is the plot in a nutshell, and some of it works and some of it fails, while some is just boring.What doesn't work? The most obvious failure is the ham-handed anti-American perspective of the director. I don't expect most foreigners to love us at this particular point in global history, and anti-American sentiment in foreign films is an old and honorable aesthetic tradition. That said, the blatant and clumsy political critique in this film is ugly to see, adds nothing to the plot, and gets in the way of both the story and the flow of the action. This is like watching a cruddy low budget American action flick from the 80s where the villains were usually greasy stereotypes of Arabs or psychopathic cardboard Russians; neither the stereotyped ethnicity nor the discerning viewer appreciated such nonsense, and seeing the same mono-dimensional caricatures applied to Americans 20 years later is hardly what might be called cinematic progress.American arrogance, wastefulness, and contempt for the environment is what causes the origin of the monster. America then pressures the South Korean govt because they are not taking a ""hard-line"" position in dealing with the menace. America then mistakenly identifies the presence of a creature-related virus which causes a panic, and then covers up the mistake to avoid taking responsibility for it. Then America forces South Korea to let the US deploy ""Agent Yellow"" an ""anti-virus"" gas which is presented as causing as many problems as it claims to solve. The deployment of the dangerous ""Agent Yellow"" is announced amid footage of American forces in Iraq, and when the gas is actually used, it does not affect the monster but instead makes many innocent bystanders ill. How clever and subtle! Why not just have the US nuke Seoul while interspersing footage of Bush and Cheney laughing?The history of the US and the South and North Koreas is a complex and rocky one, but whatever one's take on this subject, this movie adds little to political understanding, and the many logical problems in the plot caused by the anti-American polemics of the director slows things down and makes for some stupid moments, complete with a ""unusual"" crane based gas delivery system spraying noxious yellow gas all over the harbor. The South Korean government's prostration before US stupidity and bad intentions is also both blunt tiresome satire, and poses another set of logical problems for the film. Does South Korea have no independent medical or scientific community that could assess the presence (or absence) of a deadly virus in a given population?Again, I am not opposed to political perspectives in films, even horror and sf films, and I am not automatically opposed to any criticism of US policies or mindset. However, the childish, incoherent, and tedious ideas presented here are un-enjoyable to anyone except Noam Chomsky or perhaps the most nave and jingoistic of Korean audiences who see the US as the Great Satan. More importantly, the plot is destabilized and flawed by all the excess political junk; the political content in this case detracts from the film rather than enhancing it like in other better horror flicks (cf the original uncut ""Godzilla"" for instance; a far more subtle, nuanced, and thought-provoking critique of the US in Asia, and also a far superior monster movie, in which the political perspective of the director helped rather than hindered the central theme and action of the film...)Speaking of ""Godzilla"", the earlier film highlights another issue with ""The Host"" - mainly the lack of a traditional big budget monster movie feel. The creature is quite real looking and the numerous close-ups just make it seem more authentic and well-conceived. However, the money spent on a real looking monster evidently consumed most of the budget, so the scenes of monster havoc are pretty brief as are the scenes of the authorities searching for or fighting with the monster. The military response to the creature seems absurdly sparse, and the monster keeps a generally low profile. If you don't like monster movie tropes, this minimalist approach will not disturb you, but if you like the whole ""Godzilla"" feel to your monster flicks, you will feel a bit high and dry here.Finally, the ending is a downer, and quite a surprise considering the general tone and theme of the film. Most viewers will not be happy with the ending, and I think the megadose of pathos is stuck in there to both keep domestic Korean audiences weeping (always a box office boost in Seoul!) and to suggest that this is more of a ""serious"" film that it actually is.On the bright side, the cast is uniformly excellent and the way the quirky group of dispossessed and eccentric souls come together to defeat the monster is inventive and unexpected. If you know a lot about Korean culture, there are lots of interesting sub-texts on display about class and economic divides in Korean culture. The general theme throughout is distrust and criticism of authority and conformity, two of the oldest pillars of Asian society, but this is balanced by the bonds of family as the basic safety net, which is an even older pillar of Asian culture.The movie is not uninteresting, the cast is great, and the monster looks fine. The political stuff is a wrong step, and the monster movie buff may wish to see more monster at large action, but all in all this is an idiosyncratic and entertaining film. Those who are thin-skinned about anti-American diatribes (especially clumsy mono-dimensional ones) may not care for this, and horror purists may not enjoy the absence of traditional tropes and the budgetary limits, but most other viewers will find something to enjoy here.This would be a perfect 3.5 star film, but I have to round up or down, so I am rounding down because the rather lengthy runtime of the film strikes me as excessive, given the amount of agitprop poli sci stuff inserted for no legitimate aesthetic reason, so three stars it is.",3,"Political Tail Wags Monster Movie Dog,

1072074,A3BBGMBPON4X6T,B000PKG8SS,Shaun Sjolin,"[2, 4]","This little gem comes to us from South Korea, which has been putting out a lot of great genre titles lately.  It is a monster movie that mixes horror, drama, and comedy.  The film begins with a reckless American scientist ordering some chemicals dumped down the drain.  We then cut ahead to meet the family at the center of the film, the Parks.The family fits the definition of dysfunctional, with Gang-du, a dead beat son working in his father's food stand, his alcoholic brother that cannot get a job, in spite of being college educated, the sister with Olympic-level skill in archery, but is always to slow to win, and the Hyun-seo, the daughter of Gang-du.It doesn't take long for the real star of the film to show up, however.  The monster appears underneath a bridge on the Han River and soon swims over to the populated beach, causing panic as it runs through the crowd, randomly crushing and eating people.Hyun-seo gets grabbed by the monster and then it dives back into the river.  Everyone at the beach is quarantined to check for a virus, but the Parks soon receive a phone call from Hyun-seo, whom they thought was dead.  They decide to break out of quarantine and find her.The promotional material for the film regarded it as ""The greatest monster movie ever!"" and ""On par with Jaws!""  I would hesitate to put those kinds of accolades on the film, but I thought it was a really good movie.  There is a bit of anti-American sentiment in the movie, as the only Americans that are in the movie are bad guys, but it is my understanding that that is quite common in Korean cinema right now.The special effects in this film where really great.

O'Blenis,"[2, 5]","One of the best monster movies ever made - up there with the likes ofKing Kong - Extended Cut (Three-Disc Deluxe Edition)- ""The Host"" is the kind of movie that reminds you why you love movies so much in the first place.  Successfully combining so many of the elements that make filmdom great - an engaging story, tremendous visuals, memorable characters, great thrills and horror, even a surprisingly large dose of humor - this is one for the ages, one that's still going to be vital viewing twenty or fifty years from now.In Seoul, South Korea, the careless disposal of chemicals from a military base years ago - allegedy harmful-but-common substances like formeldahyde, but you have to wonder if that's really all it was - ends up creating catastrophic consequences in the modern day.  At a busy stretch of coast along the Han River, populated by picnic spots, bustling foodstands and the like, a crowd gathers, abuzz over a strange sight before them: something black, suspended from a large bridge, something that looks alive.  It's not really a good place to gather though, for the strange thing doesn't plan on staying immobile in its nook in the bridge's understructure.What starts out seeming like a very charming, slice-of-life/comedy movie, takes on a much more serious tone with the monster's first strike.  The main (human) characters of the movie are all of one family.  A 13 year-old girl is one of the first victims in the attack - seemingly.  But when her devastated father receives a cellphone call from his still-alive child, nobody in authority believes his theory: that the monster - which seemingly ate the girl - swallows its 'prey' into some kind of non-digestive department, then returns home and deposits them in its lair.  The little girl is really the one link holding her family together; some of the family members are estranged from one another, but they all love the child, and all make the bold move of attempting to track her down as a group, themselves becoming fugitives from the authorities in the process.  Meanwhile, there are different groups of authorities - both Korean and international - with their own ideas on how to handle the situation, and there are some possible implications in there, not limited to the idea that some parties are more interested in hiding their own negligence than anything else.Electrifying, heart-stirring and plausibly done, ""The Host"" succeeds on all counts.  If you haven't yet come into the world of Asian movies, this is a great place to start (and if this Is your first one, you've got a lot of other treats waitin for you!)  I'd recommend viewing this in the subtitled format, the way I saw it.  There's also an English-dubbed option on the disc, but I've heard that it's not a very good dub job.

This ambitious work misses its mark by a few yards rather than a mile.I had read many glowing reviews for this film and I sincerely wanted to like it, but this film is such a diverse mixed bag that it just doesn't work for me.  While the comedic elements are hysterically funny, they seems far too slapstick and way out of place in this kind of film and it doesn't matter if the film is meant to be campy or not.  The satirical components of the film are just too strong when subtly would have had more of an impact.  The dramatic scenes lose their potency amid the humor and satire.  There are times when this kind of juxapositioning can work well, but this film's writer and director just aren't that polished to pull off this complex and ambitious goal of making us laugh and feel a sense of tragedy at the same time.The film's actors are okay, but nothing really memorable except the elder father who is completely likable in his role.  The effects are above average, but the creature is a bit funny looking.  I mean, I actually giggled at it.  It looked something like what would occur if a giant squid got it on with a steroid infected piranha somehow.  Needless to say it never came close to scaring me as much as the shark inJawsdid in which this picture claims to be on par.  That was a poor marketing stragedy as very very few ""us against it"" films ever reach the ""Jaws"" level of filmmaking.Overall, this film was interesting if for no other reason than it tries to be different and attempts to include more and not less and that is a worthy goal; however, ""more"" should be attempted by those with more skill and finesse than those who made this effort.",2,"2.5 Stars: ""The Host"" offers a mixed bag to its guests.",1186963200,"08 13, 2007",2007,1748,"['Films', 'try', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'hit', 'nail', 'head', 'miss', 'mile', 'ambitious', 'work', 'mark', 'few', 'yards', 'rather', 'mile.I', 'had', 'read', 'many', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'film', 'sincerely', 'wanted', 'like', 'film', 'diverse', 'mixed', 'bag', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'comedic', 'elements', 'are', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'far', 'too', 'slapstick', 'way', 'place', 'kind', 'film', ""n't"", 'matter', 'film', 'meant', 'be', 'campy', 'not', 'satirical', 'components', 'film', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'strong', 'when', 'subtly', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'impact', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'lose', 'potency', 'humor', 'satire', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'kind', 'juxapositioning', 'can', 'work', 'well', 'film', 'writer', 'director', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'that', 'polished', 'pull', 'off', 'complex', 'ambitious', 'goal', 'making', 'laugh', 'feel', 'sense', 'tragedy', 'same', 'time.The', 'film', 'actors', 'are', 'okay', 'nothing', 'really', 'memorable', 'elder', 'father', 'who', 'completely', 'likable', 'role', 'effects', 'are', 'above', 'average', 'creature', 'bit', 'funny', 'looking', 'mean', 'actually', 'giggled', 'looked', 'something', 'what', 'would', 'occur', 'giant', 'squid', 'got', 'steroid', 'infected', 'piranha', 'somehow', 'Needless', 'say', 'never', 'came', 'close', 'scaring', 'as', 'much', 'shark', 'inJawsdid', 'picture', 'be', 'par', 'was', 'poor', 'marketing', 'stragedy', 'very', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'ever', 'reach', 'Jaws', 'level', 'filmmaking.Overall', 'film', 'was', 'interesting', 'other', 'reason', 'be', 'different', 'attempts', 'include', 'more', 'not', 'less', 'worthy', 'goal', 'however', 'more', 'should', 'be', 'attempted', 'more', 'skill', 'finesse', 'who', 'made', 'effort']",N/A

""...no longer Maria!""","[2, 2]","It's very challenging these days to combine dark humor, extreme mutant creatures and dysfunctional family drama in one entertaining and complex feature. Some of the great issues and concerns of humanity these days are portrayed in this thrilling, action packed, gruesome monster tale: Of course we have our giant amphibious rampaging beast, snatching people out of the Han river park in Seoul, But we also got a very interesting portrayal of the international concern about the irresponsability and arrogance of the military, along with a very detailed illustration of the toxic pollution of the planet.Like godzilla was the hiddeous product of the hydrogen bomb, this hughe deform mutant monster is a product of the intentional massive spread of formaldehyde in a river. And the most funny and original concept in this movie, was that the monster actually wasn't afraid of showing itself from the first minute. Why any mutant creature of god should be hidden, restraining itself untill the very end like in previous standard monster films? Going even further, the creature decides to hunt for humans in any sunny afternoon, creating chaos and breaking havoc in a public plaza, right after the character presentation in the early minutes! Wow! That i wasn't expecting, at all.The Family drama part was the least funny or entertaining part of the film. Maybe i didn't catch the humor or cultural comments, but these characters were actually annoying. Working on a food service stand, they had to look for the younger member, who was snatched and abducted by the beast. The bumbling man-child, the actual father of the kidnapped daughter, was really getting on my nerves despite his heroism and good intentions. Every member of the family was, in a way, socially retarded, and their quest and struggle between the panic and the virus quarantine in the city, just got me bored. Untill the final comfrontation of course.Anyway, the action, the thriller and the suspense concerning the monster were great. Not even that band of misfits could possibly make me overlook so much tension and dark atmosphere. Director Bong Joon-Ho created a drastic tour de force in the new monster genre, no doubt about it.If i could only understand better his intentions over family drama, i would have give it 5 stars. But sorry, just 4 for an incredible experience you just can't pass by if you're a horror and action fan.Great DVD edition, the 2 disc is the most recomended, i assure you.

1072081,A22I206NOGTSUJ,B000PKG8SS,tetsuojin,"[11, 35]","Whenever I watch a Godzilla or a Kaiju (""monster"" in Japanese) movie, I know exactly what to expect: frantic rubber suit monster wrestling amongst clever but cheesy special effects; miniature cities getting blown up, crushed, stomped and obliterated under the sweat and dust of those rubber suited Japanese actors; and silly dialogue recited stiffly by over the top colorful, but goofy characters. But that's the fun factor and the nostalgia about it. Put your mind in neutral and enjoy the campiness.With Korea's ""the Host"", I don't know what exactly to expect. I don't know what this movie wants to be. A parody? A thriller? A horror story? A comedy? At first, it starts off as a serious monster movie, with an absolutely horrifying chase sequence of a Polliwog-like beast rampaging and devouring people in it's mad run to the Han river. It's frightening, intense and very realistic, adding a new dimension to the kaiju drama. Then the movie veers into an emotional story of a family torn apart by this monster, and for their search for an abducted family member. At the same time, the family goes through a comedic keystone kops chase with authorities after being suspected for contracting a virus through contact with the creature. Add the element of destroying a monster by using lethal doses of ""Agent Yellow"" for the environmental angle. Throw in side stories of a gang helping a food stand vendor and the failure of a Olympic hopeful in archery for good measure into this mess of a movie. But what finally does the movie in is it's serious lack of logic, plausibility and believability, and a massive smothering of melodramatics and overwrought sentimentality (like most Koreans movies have). There are major plot holes and lapses in plausibility in this movie. Why are the Korean authorities spending all their man power and wasting all of their time hunting down a family suspected of having a virus, while doing nothing to fight or chase down the monster that created a bloody massacre and is accused of causing the virus? After the terrifying first scene, why is the Han River (where the monster dwells at) left barren and quiet instead of being saturated with boats, police and scanners, searching for the monster? Why aren't full artillery armored units, soldiers with weapons, tanks and air to land missiles/warheads being used first to fight the creature, instead of opting to use a deadly chemical that can potentially poison (and kill) the population itself? After seeing how simple and easily the monster is killed by a handful of people at the end of the movie, it makes you wonder (apologies for this non-PC sentence): how many Korean officials does it takes to screw a light bulb? It's a frustrating, aggravating viewing of a movie, with some parts bordering on brilliant, and some parts just plain awful and ridiculous. With so much potential at the beginning of the movie, the director does a disservice to Koreans (for making them look bad), and most of all, to the audience with this disappointing mess of a movie. It's like preparing a gourmet dinner, served with fine china and classic silverware, and then showering the plates with Fruit Loops, gummi bears and Captain Crunch. Encapsulated, this is like the Korean version of Independence Day.If you choose to watch the movie, catch the first half hour for the monster chase, which is brilliant. Then turn it off and tune into an old 1970's Godzilla flick.

If you are familiar with the old Godzilla and Rodan movies, then simply imagine what they would be like if brought up to modern technical standards, but with the same lack of continuity; convoluted, ridiculous plot; lousy dubbing; and laughable over-acting. The monster is excellent. His appearance and motion are really scary and believable, but the entire human part of the movie is not nearly as believable. There are some laugh-out-loud moments, both intentional and inadvertent, but the ranting histrionics get a little old. Why is it that ""actors"" in Asian monster movies never simply talk to each other? Instead they shriek, threaten, moan, and wail. Indeed, their histrionics often put the monster to shame.Enough analysis. If you want a detailed retelling of the silly ""plot"" then read some other reviews, but be advised that the plot is of little consequence. What you will be watching is a cinematic mess that is made a little more tolerable every time the monster makes an appearance and demonstrates his lousy table manners, acrobatic prowess, and olympic-grade diving skills.

1072085,A238M34Z3X2IBD,B000PKG8SS,Thomas E. O'Sullivan,"[7, 14]","THE HOST has one thing going for it, an agile, almost logical, monster... and that's it.When it's on screen, when it's moving, when it's putting the bite on people or snatching the same people up and storing them in its own version of a CRISPER drawer, there is a lot to admire in this import.  The monster's first full on screen appearence is a marvel to behold, not only because it takes place during daylight hours (very rare for these types of films), not only because it takes place within a large crowd of people, but everyone and everything involved moves in a logical fashion.  From the frist sighting to final snatch and splash, it all looks like something that could very well happen.  Wonderfully done.As for the rest... get a pen, get a pad of paper and be prepared to take notes because little next to nothing makes any kind of sense.  The central players in THE HOST is a family seemingly put together from a series of other unproduced films.  There's the father who looks like a grandfather, two sons - one, a pudgy, bulky, slow witted father himself, the other a miracle of the Korean education and political system.  He's a lawyer in training, a corporate raider, a student, a eco/bio protester who's sister just happens to be a Olympic level athelete in the field of archery (taking the Bronze at the beginning of the film).  It's almost like a skewed version of the FANTASTIC FOUR, everyone seems to have some kind odd ""gift"" that sets them apart from the rest.There is also the daughter of the pudgy, bulky slow witted father who seemes to have gotten all her looks and good sense from her mother - which, for a film like this is a good thing.  It's her smarts that help her to survive and a mother's strength that allows her to make the ultimate sacrifice.  There's an unhappy ending here in THE HOST, but you'll have a hard time either understanding it, or feeling bad about it, because the rest of the film is mired in protest... against the government, against corporations, against posions, against any and everything it can lay its hands on.THE HOST is one busy film.  Actually, it's more like six films running at once and that's its main flaw, it doesn't know what it wants to say and instead of putting its focus squarely on a family in peril and a monster on the loose, it tries too hard to sum up Korea's political, social and corporate strife.  It's just too much of everything... and because of that THE HOST will go down as a missed oppurtunity to redefine the genre.  But, for the short time the monster is the star of the picture, it works... but not enough to earn a place on your shelf.",2,ONLY HAPPY WHEN IT RAINS,1191715200,"10 7, 2007",2007,2624,"['HOST', 'one', 'thing', 'going', 'agile', 'almost', 'logical', 'monster', 'it.When', 'screen', 'when', 'moving', 'when', 'putting', 'bite', 'people', 'snatching', 'same', 'people', 'storing', 'own', 'version', 'CRISPER', 'drawer', 'lot', 'admire', 'import', 'monster', 'first', 'full', 'screen', 'appearence', 'marvel', 'behold', 'not', 'only', 'place', 'daylight', 'hours', 'very', 'rare', 'types', 'films', 'not', 'only', 'place', 'large', 'crowd', 'people', 'everyone', 'everything', 'involved', 'moves', 'logical', 'fashion', 'frist', 'sighting', 'final', 'snatch', 'splash', 'something', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'happen', 'Wonderfully', 'done.As', 'rest', 'get', 'pen', 'get', 'pad', 'paper', 'be', 'prepared', 'take', 'notes', 'little', 'next', 'nothing', 'kind', 'sense', 'central', 'players', 'HOST', 'family', 'seemingly', 'put', 'together', 'series', 'other', 'unproduced', 'films', 'father', 'who', 'grandfather', 'two', 'sons', 'one', 'pudgy', 'bulky', 'slow', 'witted', 'father', 'other', 'miracle', 'Korean', 'education', 'political', 'system', 'lawyer', 'training', 'corporate', 'raider', 'student', 'eco/bio', 'protester', 'who', 'sister', 'just', 'be', 'Olympic', 'level', 'athelete', 'field', 'archery', 'taking', 'Bronze', 'beginning', 'film', 'almost', 'skewed', 'version', 'FANTASTIC', 'FOUR', 'everyone', 'have', 'kind', 'odd', 'gift', 'apart', 'rest.There', 'also', 'daughter', 'pudgy', 'bulky', 'slow', 'witted', 'father', 'who', 'have', 'gotten', 'looks', 'good', 'sense', 'mother', 'film', 'good', 'thing', 'help', 'survive', 'mother', 'strength', 'make', 'ultimate', 'sacrifice', 'unhappy', 'ending', 'here', 'THE', 'HOST', ""'ll"", 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'understanding', 'feeling', 'bad', 'rest', 'film', 'mired', 'protest', 'government', 'corporations', 'posions', 'everything', 'can', 'lay', 'hands', 'on.THE', 'HOST', 'one', 'busy', 'film', 'Actually', 'more', 'six', 'films', 'running', 'once', 'main', 'flaw', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'say', 'instead', 'putting', 'focus', 'squarely', 'family', 'peril', 'monster', 'loose', 'too', 'hard', 'sum', 'up', 'Korea', 'political', 'social', 'corporate', 'strife', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'everything', 'THE', 'HOST', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'missed', 'oppurtunity', 'redefine', 'genre', 'short', 'time', 'monster', 'star', 'picture', 'not', 'enough', 'earn', 'place', 'shelf']",N/A
1072086,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000PKG8SS,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[11, 18]","***1/2South Korea's highest grossing film of all time ""The Host"", a new monster film, takes this genre to levels unknown previously with films like ""Godzilla"" and ""The Blob"". It represents a significant advancement in the technology and a lesser advancement in narrative.Seoul, 2000. An American army doctor (Scott Wilson) orders his assistant, a native South Korean, to dump bottles and bottles of formaldehyde into the drain, a drain running into the Han River, the major river running through the middle of Seoul. The reason? The bottles are covered with a layer of dust and the army doctor really dislikes dust. The assistant protests, but soon relents. Six years later, a food cart operator, Gang-Du (Kang-ho Song) falls asleep every time his dad, Hie-bong (Hie-Bong Byeon) is away from the stand for more than a few minutes. Soon, his daughter, Hyun-Seo (Ah-sung Ko) returns from school and they watch his sister compete in an archery tournament on television. Father and daughter are more like friends; Gang-du even seems to be a bit mentally challenged, like he is at the same level of maturity as his daughter. Then a monster appears in the river and starts to attack the people lounging by the side of the river. Gang-du and Hyun-Seo are chased by the beast and Dad tries valiantly to save his daughter, but the beast soon captures her and drags her away. Nam-Joo (Du-na Bae), the sister, returns from the tournament and they are joined by their brother, Nam-il (Hae-il Park), a young businessman annoyed at the distraction. They receive a call from the daughter's cell phone and try to rescue her, fighting the local authorities, the police, the US Army (?) and ultimately, against the large monster.Directed by Joon-ho Bong, the rights to ""The Host"" have already been purchased for an American remake, and it is easy to see why. The film's monster elements are well-done, interesting and exciting. But the film suffers from a few uneven performances and some heavy handed political statements which ultimately slow down the proceedings.From what I understand, the initial event is based on an actual event. The Korean government attempted to prosecute the guilty American, but the US wouldn't hand over the man in question. According to IMDB, he was finally convicted in 2005, but didn't serve a prison term. I always believe that a fantasy, science fiction, horror film, anything that is not normally something we would experience is more believable, has roots in reality. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a great recent example of this; the fantasy world was rooted in the very real world of Spain during the last days of the Civil War. These elements of reality help us associate the more fantastical elements of these stories, making us more willing to accept them. While watching the film, I didn't know that something like this actually happened, but I believed it, because it was convincingly done and seemed like something that could happen.The monster, created by a special effects studio in San Francisco, is a very unusual thing. Part fish, part eel, part guppy and part frog, multiplied by a thousand (the suckers big and looks like a large ""Alien""), the Monster initially appears hanging from underneath a bridge. People notice the thing and, curious, move closer to get a look. Then it drops into the water and swims towards the people. Moments later, attack.The first time the Monster runs rampant is exciting and fun to watch. The beast moves fast and wreaks havoc on a small leisure area, where people are lounging in the sun next to the river. Naturally, Gang-du and his family will be in the center of the action, they are our entry into this world. The monster chases people back and forth, takes a few, but Gang-du tries to elude the beast, tries to keep his daughter safe.The monster is fearsome, and dangerous, making it a little scary. Because it is fast, this adds to the suspense. You never know when or where it will pop up. It also appears to be smart and has a voracious appetite, adding to the scariness of the beast. When it grabs Hyun-Seo, the drama increases because Gang-du naturally fears his daughter is dead, then they receive a cryptic phone message indicating she might still be alive. The family bands together and starts to hunt for her. This leads the individual characters on `hero's journeys' of their own, until they have to come together and work together to fight the beast.As the family comes together, and gets separated, during their battle with the monster, they face various obstacles. Many of these are also presented in a fairly realistic fashion, adding to the heightened level of suspense. Each is tested, some with frightening results.The film is less successful as a political statement against the involvement of the US Government in this country and in this incident. As soon as the animal runs rampant, it attacks a US Citizen who is vacationing. Then the news is filled with stories of a virus the man contracted through the monster. Soon, the US Army has quarantined people, hunting for others who have come into contact with the beast, closing off entire areas and plans to use a chemical called ""Agent Yellow"", not a very thinly veiled attempt to make a statement against Agent Orange. This is done in a rather sloppy fashion, and not fully integrated into the rest of the story. This brings the rest of the film down. In the big confrontation between the beast and `Agent Yellow', the Army intends to dispense the chemical using a large yellow plastic ball on the end of a crane, which shoots the chemical in a large plume. Hopefully, their targeting system is much more accurate than the contraption looks, it resembles a large tinker toy. Of course, the chemical doesn't have the intended effect and there are many shots of indigenous South Koreans suffering at the hands of the nasty American chemical.These scenes are really more of a distraction, not necessary and detract from the overall quality of the rest of the film. The monster is a neat, unique creation which is scary, threatening and fun to watch. But when the film gets bogged down with all of the politics, it loses focus.I didn't really get what Kang-ho Song was trying to do as Gang-du. Initially, we see he is lazy and more interested in cutting corners than helping to make a success out of the family's food van, very antithetical to the South Korean way of life. But when his daughter shows up, I initially thought he was an older, less intelligent brother. He seems to want to have this type of relationship with his daughter, but he really seems more mentally challenged than anything else. This is clearly done to make his actions throughout the rest of the film appear all the more heroic, but his portrayal is initially inconsistent.During the last act, when the family has to come together again to defeat the creature, the film shifts again, delivering on the premise of the earlier story.""The Host"" is a good film, which benefits greatly from advanced special effects and suspenseful storytelling, but it suffers from an almost sophomoric attempt to make a political statement, slowing down the pace of the story, and interrupting the flow of horror, suspense and excitement.I wonder if the American remake will have some sort of reference to terrorists trying to take over the water supply of St. Louis and they inadvertently create this beast who roams through the upper Mississippi river.",4,"3 1/2 - Monster is Interesting, but ""Host"" Gets Bogged Down with America Bashing",1177891200,"04 30, 2007",2007,7438,"['***1/2South', 'Korea', 'highest', 'grossing',

Everything from a three-eyed fish in The Simpsons introductions to a lovely little superstar named Godzilla taught me that as a kid, and the somewhat different style of The Host helped to reinforce that in a way that safety videos never do. Add in a family that doesn't quite get along, a government that doesn't really know what to make of something thrashing around in their rivers, men in bright colors, enough bones to make a fantastic roadkill mixed-media sculpture, and slap on a coat of comedy and you have a pretty little playpen that translates to The Host.While many people don't like to see The Host compared to Godzilla films, it really does have the feel of the late 90s Godzilla with a better budget, a REALLY nice monster, and something that might be pieced together better than some of those movies. The family REALLY evoked the comparisons, especially in the case of the son and the things that happen to him, and the point to the movie was similar to the core of the Godzilla theme. There were a lot more components than the monster in this as well, and the way they to fit into the fold actually surprised me because those things seemed like they would be secondary when I saw the previews and not such good primary focuses.If I had to complain about one thing, it would be that the monster made its guest appearance really suddenly, managed to get me really excited as it did what it did for about twenty minutes or more, and then became a pawn in a game much larger than the beast itself. I guess that was a misgiving of mine while going into the film - still, the way the film was marketed made me think an elderly man with a shotgun and a younger lady with a bow would be throwing down with a beast.That KINDA happened, with a heavy KINDA rolling off my tongue, but not really.In this case, the previews realllly stretch the ""what is what.""When you see this movie, keep that in mind and don't go into it with the expectation of a monstercentric core. Don't get overly excited when you see the monster, either, and remember that this is Korean Cinema and that it follows some of the same formulas - and flaws - that Korean films normally follow. Korean film reminds me of Hong Kong film a few years ago, when it was still finding strong legs to walk on, in the respect that they are a bit choppy sometimes but that they still haven't found a specific flow. That's good, too, because you don't want a centralized theme in all your movies you want things like The Host to be made. Also bear in mind that it IS also like a Godzilla film in the aspects mentioned earlier, and that those pieces genius when you have a director that knows how to make something great. Combine this with the monster, the mayhem, and a really nice twist and you have a movie that shouldn't be overlooked because it's slinky, sexy, and good.O, and don't watch the dubbing no matter the temptation.

1072089,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B000PKG8SS,trashcanman,"[122, 140]","Pay no mind to the countless comparisons to ""Jaws"", ""Alien"", and the rest of the monster classics that a quality film like this always draws. This one stands on its own as an original mix of harsh political commentary, family drama, black comedy, and horror. The metaphor for the hysteria over the asian SARS epidemic is thick and the accusatory tone towards America's interventionist ways and the alarmist media's sensationalism is thicker. But don't think this is some heavy-handed self-serving political film that wallows in its own symbolism; this film is about the importance of family pulling together and taking care of each other when noone else will. Oh yes, and there's a monster in there somewhere too.I'm going to drop a few minor spoilers now so if you want to go in completely cold and experience the full thrill I received viewing this movie you might want to go watch the film now. Alright, on with the content review. Let me put it this way, I got my money's worth in the first 20 minutes of the film. The sudden appearance of the beast breaks the most entrenched of monster movie standards: the slow reveal. The almost complete lack of buildup shocked me as the monster came charging out of the background in its high-velocity and unsettlingly awkward gait with ferocious momentum sending humanity flying left and right. What follows is one of the greatest rampage sequences ever seen by human eyes. I was absolutely thrilled by it and only the most jaded of film fans could feel otherwise. In fact, aside from a few gaping plot holes, my only real complaint about this movie is that it climaxes so soon. That's not to say the rest of the film isn't good, but it never reaches that fever pitch again.As the trigger-happy government declares quarantine and almost immediately begins asserting it's will on the victims -even as they still mourn their lost family members- the media spreads word of a deadly and highly contagious virus that the creature is carrying (hence, ""the host""). But as the film progresses, we don't see the evidence of any abnormal sickness, just the paranoia of the people in reaction to the media's hysterics and government's jumping to conclusions. As our protagonists, the Park family, search for their little girl (Hyun-seo, taken to the monster's den for later consumption) we come to see that when the government is incompetent and overbearing and the general populace is collectively terrified of the guy standing next to them the only things you can rely on are your own family and what you can see and do for yourself.The ne'er-do-well Park family consists of Hyun-seo's father, a slow-witted narcoleptic, her aunt who's a professional archer with a tendency to freeze under pressure, a college-educated alcoholic of an uncle with a hot temper who can't find a job, and a caring grandfather who holds them all together. The dysfunction of the family is humorous to watch, but the devotion they all share in the search for their little girl is touching; and that's the real heart and soul of this film. The monster is menacing, the government is corrupt, the Americans are comically over-the-top self-serving jerks, the populace at large are terrified for all the wrong reasons, and the real disease is the paranoia spread by the media but the Park family's struggle is the real story here and it's a great one.",4,Wonderfully original monster flick.,1179187200,"05 15, 2007",2007,3360,"['Pay', 'mind', 'countless', 'comparisons', 'Jaws', 'Alien', 'rest', 'monster', 'classics', 'quality', 'film', 'always', 'one', 'own', 'original', 'mix', 'harsh', 'political', 'commentary', 'family', 'drama', 'black', 'comedy', 'horror', 'metaphor', 'hysteria', 'asian', 'SARS', 'epidemic', 'thick', 'accusatory', 'tone', 'towards', 'America', 'interventionist', 'ways', 'alarmist', 'media', 'sensationalism', 'thicker', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'heavy-handed', 'self-serving', 'political', 'film', 'own', 'symbolism', 'film', 'importance', 'family', 'pulling', 'together', 'taking', 'care', 'other', 'when', 'noone', 'else', 'will', 'Oh', 'yes', 'monster', 'somewhere', 'too.I', ""'m"", 'going', 'drop', 'few', 'minor', 'spoilers', 'now', 'so', 'want', 'go', 'completely', 'cold', 'experience', 'full', 'thrill', 'received', 'viewing', 'movie', 'might', 'want', 'go', 'watch', 'film', 'now', 'Alright', 'content', 'review', 'Let', 'put', 'way', 'got', 'money', 'worth', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'film', 'sudden', 'appearance', 'beast', 'most', 'entrenched', 'monster', 'movie', 'standards', 'slow', 'reveal', 'almost', 'complete', 'lack', 'buildup', 'shocked', 'monster', 'came', 'charging', 'background', 'high-velocity', 'unsettlingly', 'awkward', 'gait', 'ferocious', 'momentum', 'sending', 'humanity', 'flying', 'left', 'right', 'What', 'one', 'greatest', 'rampage', 'sequences', 'ever', 'seen', 'human', 'eyes', 'was', 'absolutely', 'thrilled', 'only', 'most', 'jaded', 'film', 'fans', 'could', 'feel', 'otherwise', 'fact', 'aside', 'few', 'gaping', 'plot', 'holes', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'movie', 'so', 'soon', 'not', 'say', 'rest', 'film', ""n't"", 'good', 'never', 'fever', 'pitch', 'trigger-happy', 'government', 'quarantine', 'almost', 'immediately', 'asserting', 'will', 'victims', '-even', 'still', 'mourn', 'lost', 'family', 'members-', 'media', 'word', 'deadly', 'highly', 'contagious', 'virus', 'creature', 'carrying', 'hence', 'host', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'evidence', 'abnormal', 'sickness', 'just', 'paranoia', 'people', 'reaction', 'media', 'hysterics', 'government', 'jumping', 'conclusions', 'protagonists', 'Park', 'family', 'search', 'little', 'girl', 'Hyun-seo', 'taken', 'monster', 'den', 'later', 'consumption', 'come', 'see', 'when', 'government', 'incompetent', 'overbearing', 'general', 'populace', 'collectively', 'terrified', 'guy', 'standing', 'next', 'only', 'things', 'can', 'rely', 'are', 'own', 'family', 'what', 'can', 'see', 'do', 'yourself.The', ""ne'er-do-well"", 'Park', 'family', 'Hyun-seo', 'father', 'slow-witted', 'narcoleptic', 'aunt', 'who', 'professional', 'archer', 'tendency', 'freeze', 'pressure', 'college-educated', 'alcoholic', 'uncle', 'hot', 'temper', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'job', 'caring', 'grandfather', 'who', 'together', 'dysfunction', 'family', 'humorous', 'watch', 'devotion', 'share', 'search', 'little', 'girl', 'touching', 'real', 'heart', 'soul', 'film', 'monster', 'menacing', 'government', 'corrupt', 'Americans', 'are', 'comically', 'over-the-top', 'self-serving', 'jerks', 'populace', 'large', 'are', 'terrified', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'real', 'disease', 'paranoia', 'spread', 'media', 'Park', 'family', 'struggle', 'real', 'story', 'here', 'great', 'one']",N/A

Sometimes it is sort of humorous in a stranegly inappropriate way.  I suspect that there may be jokes and references that require a better knowledge of Korean culture.  I got the feeling there were jokes that I was missing as an American.  The director seems to have a prejudice toward Americans, though I guess it may not be politically correct to even notice that kind of thing. If you're hoping for a scary asian monster flick don't watch The Host. There are some very very creative and scary asian movies.  This movie really, really is terrible.  Asian movies tend to twist all the standard predictable formulas and create unpredictable scenes.  This movie is not one of those.  You know what is going to happen.  You know that bow and arrow is going to play a role in the demise of the creature, but they make you wait for it.  I read a lot of reviews that praised it, and well, felt pretty strongly like somebody just had to warn you.  Some people who enjoy really bad movies in the way MST3K used to satire bad movies might find some entertainment value here.  It is on par with some of those featured films, but without the humorous laugh track or the cute bots, or the one liners.  Luckily I had a friend watching this disastrous flick with me who was able to provide some of those one-liners, though not with a fast enough pace to truly keep me entertained.

Especially when that drain runs into Seoul's Han River. And especially when said formaldehyde mixes with an existing creature in the river and mutates into a giant blood-thirsty crocodile-squid-alien that immediately begins to ravage the city. A young scientist learns this lesson within the first ten minutes of the pulse-pounding horror-comedy The Host.Unwilling to stick to the typical monster movie layout, The Host is two hours of almost constant, frenetic action sequences following the quest of one family to reclaim their youngest member from the mutant beast's lair deep in the sewer. After a brutal attack on a lakeside park, the government and U.S. armed forces descend on the city and quarantine everyone who was near the location, claiming that the creature is a host of a terrible virus that must be contained. But with young Hyun-seo still alive and trapped in the monster's hiding place, one family can't let government policy stand in their way, as they set out to find and free the young girl.The Host is an intriguing mix of strange comedy and frightfully scary horror sequences. With more shots of the creature than any similar movie to date, The Host gives audiences what they came to see: an expertly crafted and showcased horror monster running amok on the shore and then diving back into its home in the water. The gaping maw filled with razor-sharp teeth is reminiscent of Alien, while its size and swimming ability are like bringing Jaws onto the land.Sometimes the story gets a little confusing, but Eastern films have a tendency to do that to our Western minds, especially horror films that are based around scaring you silly rather than maintaining a solid through-line. Made in Korea, The Host manages better than Japanese films such as Ju-On and Ringu to follow a legitimate story through to its thrilling end. It's difficult to classify The Host as just one type of movie, considering it has sequences of action, adventure, horror, comedy, drama, fantasy, sci-fi, and the good old fashioned thriller mixed together into its own new breed of film (perhaps there's some formaldehyde thrown in there for good measure).Horror fans will find that there's more than enough to keep them interested and constantly impressed, while movie-goers who appreciate solid acting will also be able to enjoy the film. Overall, The Host is a solid recreation and rebirth of the creature-feature for the 21st century. With a bigger monster, more realistic story, and intense and lingering shots of the ferocious beast, The Host is sure to be an instant horror classic.",4,Solid mix of horror-comedy-thriller,1184457600,"07 15, 2007",2007,2669,"['First', 'pouring', 'countless', 'bottles', 'formaldehyde', 'down', 'sink', 'drain', 'bad', 'idea', 'Especially', 'when', 'drain', 'Seoul', 'Han', 'River', 'especially', 'when', 'said', 'formaldehyde', 'mixes', 'existing', 'creature', 'river', 'giant', 'blood-thirsty', 'crocodile-squid-alien', 'immediately', 'ravage', 'city', 'young', 'scientist', 'lesson', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'pulse-pounding', 'horror-comedy', 'Host.Unwilling', 'stick', 'typical', 'monster', 'movie', 'layout', 'Host', 'two', 'hours', 'almost', 'constant', 'frenetic', 'action', 'sequences', 'following', 'quest', 'one', 'family', 'reclaim', 'youngest', 'member', 'mutant', 'beast', 'lair', 'deep', 'sewer', 'brutal', 'attack', 'lakeside', 'park', 'government', 'U.S.', 'armed', 'forces', 'descend', 'city', 'quarantine', 'everyone', 'who', 'was', 'location', 'claiming', 'creature', 'host', 'terrible', 'virus', 'must', 'be', 'contained', 'young', 'Hyun-seo', 'still', 'alive', 'trapped', 'monster', 'hiding', 'place', 'one', 'family', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'government', 'policy', 'stand', 'way', 'set', 'out', 'find', 'free', 'young', 'girl.The', 'Host', 'intriguing', 'mix', 'strange', 'comedy', 'frightfully', 'scary', 'horror', 'sequences', 'more', 'shots', 'creature', 'similar', 'movie', 'date', 'Host', 'audiences', 'what', 'came', 'see', 'expertly', 'crafted', 'showcased', 'horror', 'monster', 'running', 'amok', 'shore', 'then', 'diving', 'back', 'home', 'water', 'gaping', 'maw', 'filled', 'razor-sharp', 'teeth', 'reminiscent', 'Alien', 'size', 'swimming', 'ability', 'are', 'bringing', 'Jaws', 'land.Sometimes', 'story', 'little', 'confusing', 'Eastern', 'films', 'have', 'tendency', 'do', 'Western', 'minds', 'especially', 'horror', 'films', 'are', 'based', 'scaring', 'silly', 'rather', 'maintaining', 'solid', 'through-line', 'Made', 'Korea', 'Host', 'better', 'Japanese', 'films', 'such', 'Ju-On', 'Ringu', 'follow', 'legitimate', 'story', 'thrilling', 'end', 'difficult', 'classify', 'Host', 'just', 'one', 'type', 'movie', 'considering', 'sequences', 'action', 'adventure', 'horror', 'comedy', 'drama', 'fantasy', 'sci-fi', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'thriller', 'mixed', 'together', 'own', 'new', 'breed', 'film', 'perhaps', 'formaldehyde', 'thrown', 'there', 'good', 'measure', '.Horror', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'more', 'enough', 'keep', 'interested', 'constantly', 'impressed', 'movie-goers', 'who', 'appreciate', 'solid', 'acting', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Overall', 'Host', 'solid', 'recreation', 'rebirth', 'creature-feature', '21st', 'century', 'bigger', 'monster', 'more', 'realistic', 'story', 'intense', 'lingering', 'shots', 'ferocious', 'beast', 'Host', 'sure', 'be', 'instant', 'horror', 'classic']",N/A
