But while 'Others' goes for the brass ring of being The Big Picture that depicts the sordid truth that propped up the DDR, Barbara tells the story on a smaller, more subtle scale.This is Barbara: one woman's story.  It's her quiet desperation and struggle to get out of what is now clearly a failing state.  She's put the wheels in motion and now has to oh-so-cautiously carefully execute her plan.  There are eyes everywhere.  Standing in the way: her own conscience.  Not about turning on the state mind you.  Zero remorse there. Rather, it's about her commitment to two new people in her life: her new patient, clearly distressed and suicidal; and, her new boss, Andr&eacute;, someone whose tender heart is revealed throughout the movie.  How this all plays out makes for some stirring story-telling.IMDB tells me that if I likedRust And Bone(which I did in spades - thank you, Jacques Audiard), then I'll like 'Barbara.'  Couldn't agree more.  If you're in the same camp, by all means watch this great little movie.",5,"If you loved 'The Lives Of Others,' then 'Barbara' is your cup of tea",1392249600,"02 13, 2014",2014,1162,"[""'re"", 'someone', 'who', 'enjoyedThe', 'Lives', 'Others-', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'thrilled', ""'Barbara"", ""'Others"", 'brass', 'ring', 'being', 'Big', 'Picture', 'sordid', 'truth', 'propped', 'up', 'DDR', 'Barbara', 'story', 'smaller', 'more', 'subtle', 'scale.This', 'Barbara', 'one', 'woman', 'story', 'quiet', 'desperation', 'struggle', 'get', 'what', 'now', 'clearly', 'failing', 'state', 'put', 'wheels', 'motion', 'now', 'oh-so-cautiously', 'carefully', 'execute', 'plan', 'are', 'eyes', 'everywhere', 'Standing', 'way', 'own', 'conscience', 'Not', 'turning', 'state', 'mind', 'Zero', 'remorse', 'there', 'commitment', 'two', 'new', 'people', 'life', 'new', 'patient', 'clearly', 'distressed', 'suicidal', 'new', 'boss', 'Andr', 'eacute', 'someone', 'tender', 'heart', 'revealed', 'movie', 'How', 'out', 'stirring', 'story-telling.IMDB', 'tells', 'likedRust', 'Bone', 'did', 'spades', 'thank', 'Jacques', 'Audiard', 'then', ""'ll"", 'like', ""'Barbara"", 'Could', ""n't"", 'agree', 'more', ""'re"", 'same', 'camp', 'means', 'watch', 'great', 'little', 'movie']","Barbara (2012) [ NON-USA FORMAT, Blu-Ray, Reg.B Import - Germany ]"

Unlike ""The Lives of Others"", it does so most tediously. Barbara is a doctor who hates the Communist regime: she is transferred from Berlin to a clinic in a remote town on the Baltic coast after she requests permission to leave the country. She has a West German lover who is keen to arrange her escape and have her come live with him. Barbara is regularly harassed by the local police and is sure the other male doctor in the clinic is spying on her. So we plod on and we see Barbara being bothered by the police and taking care of various teenagers from the miserable local work camp. She slowly develops feelings for the male doctor and her quandary (escape or not escape) only increases when - clumsy writing alert - she is with her lover and he tells her that when she gets to the West she won't have to work because he earns so much money. The pacing throughout is dreadfully slow and there is no suspense, even right up to the end. I kept trying to turn it off and my wife resisted, at one point saying ""I'm waiting for a surprise ending"". My response was ""Oh, you think it will get interesting?"" The end does come and thank goodness, although of course it's a cliche.

BARBARA affords an acute look at the inside of a totalitarian state. While it doesn't show a whole lot in this regard, what it does is shown most effectively.

1606868,A3TXY9E0HDWMXK,B00A8PPL9M,Howard Schumann,"[1, 1]","Set in Communist East Germany in the early 1980s, cold war paranoia is in full view in Christian Petzold's Barbara, winner of the Silver Berlin Bear for Best Director at the Berlinale. In Barbara, Petzold has fashioned not only a superb character study but a film that illuminates the effects of oppression on the human psyche, an oppression that ended in Germany only with the dismantling of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of East and West many years later. The film shows the East German security apparatus' (Stasi) use of intimidation and disorientation as tools in operating a system of control and surveillance directed at those suspected of opposing the GDR.Portrayed by Nina Hoss in a performance of remarkable nuance and authenticity, Barbara, an East Berlin doctor, has been exiled to a small clinic in the provinces after applying for an exit visa to visit her boyfriend in the West. She is a tall, stately, and attractive woman, yet taciturn and distant, her face filled with an indescribable sadness. Trying to serve her patients as best she can, she knows that she is under surveillance by the Stasi, particularly by Officer Klaus Schutz (Rainer Bock), who does not hesitate to conduct unannounced searches of Barbara's apartment, even her person, and whose presence in her life is all too visible.Not knowing whom to trust, thinking (perhaps rightly so) that her friends and colleagues may be police informants, Barbara's aloofness leads her colleagues to give her the nickname of ""Berlin"" to describe what they think is her big-city attitude. On the job, however, she does not allow her fears to get in the way of her professional responsibilities and her relationship with her patients shows her hidden warmth. Dr. Andr&eacute; Reiser (Ronald Zehrfeld), a soft-looking, slightly heavy-set doctor, solicits her friendship and offers repeatedly to drive her home but she keeps him at arms length, suspicious of his possible connections.In spite of this tense atmosphere, Barbara manages to befriend Stella (Jasna Fritzi Bauer), a young patient who escaped from a work camp at Torgau. Correctly diagnosing her with Meningitis, a diagnosis that the other doctors had overlooked, she reads The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn to her in the evening, a story of two people on the run. More tension is added when we see Barbara's surreptitious exchange of black market cigarettes and packets of money with people unknown. In a rapturous meeting with her West German lover Jorg (Mark Waschke) in a secluded forest area, she is given the choice of leaving the country with him, reassured that, because of his circumstances, she would no longer have to work.Barbara and her friend make plans, but her growing relationship with Andr&eacute; and ties to young Stella become complicating factors. Andr&eacute;'s own story of how he ended up in the village only adds to her confusion and uncertainty. Barbara is an understated gem that never hits us over the head with its message but leaves no doubt about its implications. While the film depicts the circumstances in a particular country, it transcends its limitations to become a universal experience. A compelling and riveting film, it begins in resignation and ends in transformation.",5,A compelling and riveting film,1370044800,"06 1, 2013",2013,3246,"['Set', 'Communist', 'East', 'Germany', 'early', '1980s', 'cold', 'war', 'paranoia', 'full', 'view', 'Christian', 'Petzold', 'Barbara', 'winner', 'Silver', 'Berlin', 'Bear', 'Best', 'Director', 'Berlinale', 'Barbara', 'Petzold', 'fashioned', 'not', 'only', 'superb', 'character', 'study', 'film', 'effects', 'oppression', 'human', 'psyche', 'oppression', 'ended', 'Germany', 'only', 'dismantling', 'Berlin', 'Wall', 'reunification', 'East', 'West', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'film', 'East', 'German', 'security', 'apparatus', 'Stasi', 'use', 'intimidation', 'disorientation', 'tools', 'operating', 'system', 'control', 'surveillance', 'directed', 'suspected', 'opposing', 'GDR.Portrayed', 'Nina', 'Hoss', 'performance', 'remarkable', 'nuance', 'authenticity', 'Barbara', 'East', 'Berlin', 'doctor', 'been', 'exiled', 'small', 'clinic', 'provinces', 'applying', 'exit', 'visa', 'visit', 'boyfriend', 'West', 'tall', 'stately', 'attractive', 'woman', 'taciturn', 'distant', 'face', 'filled', 'indescribable', 'sadness', 'Trying', 'serve', 'patients', 'best', 'can', 'surveillance', 'Stasi', 'particularly', 'Officer', 'Klaus', 'Schutz', 'Rainer', 'Bock', 'who', 'not', 'hesitate', 'conduct', 'unannounced', 'searches', 'Barbara', 'apartment', 'even', 'person', 'presence', 'life', 'too', 'visible.Not', 'knowing', 'whom', 'trust', 'thinking', 'perhaps', 'rightly', 'so', 'friends', 'colleagues', 'may', 'be', 'police', 'informants', 'Barbara', 'aloofness', 'colleagues', 'give', 'nickname', 'Berlin', 'describe', 'what', 'think', 'big-city', 'attitude', 'job', 'however', 'not', 'allow', 'fears', 'get', 'way', 'professional', 'responsibilities', 'relationship', 'patients', 'hidden', 'warmth', 'Dr.', 'Andr', 'eacute', 'Reiser', 'Ronald', 'Zehrfeld', 'soft-looking', 'slightly', 'heavy-set', 'doctor', 'friendship', 'repeatedly', 'drive', 'home', 'arms', 'length', 'suspicious', 'possible', 'connections.In', 'spite', 'tense', 'atmosphere', 'Barbara', 'befriend', 'Stella', 'Jasna', 'Fritzi', 'Bauer', 'young', 'patient', 'who', 'escaped', 'work', 'camp', 'Torgau', 'Correctly', 'diagnosing', 'Meningitis', 'diagnosis', 'other', 'doctors', 'had', 'overlooked', 'Adventures', 'Huckleberry', 'Finn', 'evening', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'run', 'More', 'tension', 'added', 'when', 'see', 'Barbara', 'surreptitious', 'exchange', 'black', 'market', 'cigarettes', 'packets', 'money', 'people', 'unknown', 'rapturous', 'meeting', 'West', 'German', 'lover', 'Jorg', 'Mark', 'Waschke', 'secluded', 'forest', 'area', 'given', 'choice', 'leaving', 'country', 'reassured', 'circumstances', 'would', 'no', 'longer', 'have', 'work.Barbara', 'friend', 'make', 'plans', 'growing', 'relationship', 'Andr', 'eacute', 'ties', 'young', 'Stella', 'become', 'complicating', 'factors', 'Andr', 'eacute', 'own', 'story', 'how', 'ended', 'up', 'village', 'only', 'confusion', 'uncertainty', 'Barbara', 'understated', 'gem', 'never', 'head', 'message', 'doubt', 'implications', 'film', 'circumstances', 'particular', 'country', 'limitations', 'become', 'universal', 'experience', 'compelling', 'riveting', 'film', 'resignation', 'transformation']","Barbara (2012) [ NON-USA FORMAT, Blu-Ray, Reg.B Import - Germany ]"
1606869,A11W5PP5FM494X,B00A8PPL9M,Jake H. -- Chicago,"[3, 3]","For Barbara, that's the West.  She longs to escape oppressive East Germany, where she is a known malcontent and the object of Stasi surveillance and oppression.  A doctor from East Berlin, her punishment inlcudes banishment to the sticks, far away from even East German sophistication.  She has a lover from the West who makes secret visits and helps plan her escape.  Meanwhile, she becomes involved in the treatment, and lives, of her adolescent patients and slowly becomes drawn to her boss, a fellow doctor tasked with making reports on Barbara to the Stasi.  His motives are ambiguous to start with -- he seems sensitive and intelligent, but we, as Barbara, don't know initially to what extent it's an act, or to what extent he supports the regime that Barbara so despises.  I can't give away the end, but suffice it to say that it carries a major turn, and that turn makes perfect sense of all that has come before.The story unfolds at a gradual pace.  Some may think it's too slow.  To me, it felt natural, and it carried plenty of suspense.  Its naturalism is unforced, unaffected, unlike films that convey realism with a nausea-inducing hand-held camera or tediously long shots of nothing much.  Here, you disappear into the world of the movie without noticing how the trick is done.Nina Hoss's performance, like those of others in the film, is beautifully subtle -- so subtle that you become attuned to even the slightest adjustments in her outward attitude.

1606872,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00A8PPL9M,Paul Allaer,"[19, 20]","""Barbara"" (2012 release from Germany; 105 min.) brings the story of a female doctor, Barbara (played by Nina Hoss), in a provincial town in East Germany in 1980. It appears Barbara had applied for an exit visa so as to leave the country, and as a result was demoted from a prestigious hospital in Berlin to now work in the country side. Barbara has a lover, some well to-do guy in West Germany who sends her money so as to prepare things for her to escape East Germany illegally. All the while, Barbara gets to know Andre (played by Ronald Zehrfeld), a colleague doctor who also has been sidetracked (but for different reasons we later learn) in the country side. Right away from the very start Andre has a crush on Barbara, and he is trying to charm her non-stop. As all of this is happening, Barbara takes a special interest in Stella, a teenage girl who has escaped from a nearby youth labor camp and suffers from various ailments. To tell you more about the plot would ruin your viewing experience. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out. I will say that I did not see the end coming at all, so you are in for a surprise!Several comments: the movie does a great job depicting life in East Germany in the early 80s. Pay close attention to the scenery in the small town where Barbara is working, and notice how stark everything is. Cars are far and few between, and the living conditions are pretty dull, if not grim. In between we also notice the never-ending political pressure that existed in East Germany, where everyone and anyone could be spying on you on behalf of the Stasi (the East German state security agency). More importantly, the movie brings a nuanced and rich character study of the various roles, none more so than the lead character, as we see her struggle between charging forward and preparing for her planned escape to the West, while caring for the people around her. Nina Hoss brings nothing short of a brilliant performance.I read that Germany is submitting this movie as its official entry for Best Foreign Movie for the next Oscars (early, 2013) and that seems fully deserved. As it happened, I saw this movie during a recent home visit to Belgium.

being off balance,unexpected camera angles,languid long shots and sudden close-ups.Nina Hoss is his regular lead actress(cf.Yella,a woman in Germany's depressed East who seeks Western success but maybe only dreaming her escape from the lake into which her stalker ex-husband has plunged her).In Barbara she's a doctor seeking to flee provincial East Germany where she's been sent for wanting to

looks and gazes.Peltzoid fleshes out the idea of DDR with colour,the wind, green woodland,cawing gulls,the sea, the night lights.Having Barbara making trips on her cycle opens this up,with over-the-shoulder-glances.We are in a world of mood-music,despite the fact Barbara is called on by the Stasi a couple of times,her pokey rooms searched and her body(by a female),for incriminating evidence about her desire to escape.Cold and aloof from hercolleagues, a caring co-worker Andre(Zehrfeld) who maybe monitoring her,attempts to make her feel wellcome.A coded communication

local socialist work camp,and makes a crucial discovery about another patient,Mario,who she and Andre will have to perform emergency surgery on when from a kiss,the doctors are getting closer.There is

Here the suspense is not about what happens to her; it is about the decision she makes in a society pervaded by suspicion and mistrust. To call it a thriller may be misleading as the film is more about the central character and the changes she undergoes against the background of the Cold War.Germany's official submission to the Best Foreign Language Film category the Oscars 2013, &#8220;Barbara&#8221; is an engrossing portrayal of credible characters and their relationship.

1606880,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B00A8PPL9M,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[6, 9]","Barbara is a German period drama, set in 1980 when there was still an East Germany under a repressive Communist government.  It won a number of awards in Germany including the Silver Bear award for Best Director (Christian Petzold) and was Germany's official submission to the Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film though it failed to make the final shortlist.The film centers around a German doctor named Barbara (Nina Hoss), beginning with her arrival at a small country hospital in an obscure rural town on the Baltic Sea coast.  We learn that she has been transferred there from her former position at the prestigious Charit&eacute; hospital in East Berlin as punishment for having dared to file an ""Ausreiseantrag"" (an official request to leave the German Democratic Republic) so that she could join her lover J&ouml;rg (Mark Waschke), a doctor living in West Germany.  At her new post, Barbara works as a pediatric surgeon under the department's chief physician, Andr&eacute; (Ronald Zehrfeld).  Although Andr&eacute; makes an attempt to be sociable, Barbara maintains a cool distance (from him and everyone else) telling him directly that she knows the local Stasi (the East German secret police), headed by a man named Sch&uuml;tz (Rainer Bock) has ordered him to spy on her.  The shamed expression on his face at her accusation confirms that it is so.  This is life in East Germany of the period:  the Stasi are watching you and they want you to know that they're watching you.While keeping an emotional distance from everyone around her, Barbara does however openly care about her patients.  She is also an excellent doctor, a point which is made when a young girl named Stella (Jasna Fritzi Bauer), a runaway from the local youth detention center for juvenile offenders, is brought in for treatment.  Andr&eacute; initially thinks she is faking being ill, but Barbara quickly contradicts him, diagnosing the girl as suffering from meningitis.  A caring and compassionate doctor himself, Andr&eacute; is not only impressed by her skill but also by the way Barbara attends to the girl during treatment.  During treatment though he determines that Stella is pregnant, which makes returning her to the detention center all that much harder for Barbara.In spite of the scrutiny with which she is being watched, Barbara has not given up on leaving East Germany.  She is working on a plan for escape with the assistance of J&ouml;rg, whom she slips away to meet in secret at an Interhotel  (special East German hotels for visiting foreigners).  The ultimate plan involves getting money to Barbara which she will use to pay her passage to be picked up at a secluded beach location one night and smuggled out to a boat which will take her across the Baltic to Denmark where J&ouml;rg will be waiting for her.  But as the appointed night approaches, complications ensue, and Barbara finds herself being pulled between her desire to escape and her role as a doctor when Andr&eacute; says he needs her to assist in an operation on a patient that night.  And her feelings for Andr&eacute; himself, whose compassionate nature and commitment as a doctor has softened her initial attitude towards him.  But when Stella suddenly appears at her door, injured from another escape attempt and in need of her help, Barbara faces an even more difficult set of choices.The movie is best at depicting how restrictive, repressive and just plain depressing life was under the old East German regime, and at showing the stresses that come from being constantly under surveillance by a government that made a point of showing that they had myriad ways of making your life difficult, as Barbara's experiences exemplify:  loss of job, being sent to a place where you know no one, living in drab conditions with no comforts or amenities and worst of all, no real hope for the future.  And of course the prospect of having the Stasi suddenly show up to search your living quarters, not because they expect to find anything but simply to remind you that they can whenever they feel like it.  And for any transgression - like not being where they can find you, as Barbara commits when she slips away to meet J&ouml;rg at the Interhotel for a few hours - they up the repressive measures, subjecting her to humiliating cavity searches the next time they show up to search her apartment.  The film emphasizes the grimness of life in that time by the muted colors and overall greyness of the setting, and by lacking a musical score for most of the film, which makes the scenes pass in the midst of a subduing stillness, heightening the effect of watching Barbara's growing tension and anxiety as the repressiveness of her life threatens to overwhelm her.Most of the performances are quite good, with a couple of exceptions.  Nina Hoss does an excellent job of bringing out Barbara's intense self-enclosure, the way she shuts herself off from the people around her as a survival measure, only occasionally letting her guard down with people like the girl Stella, her lover J&ouml;rg, and ultimately with Andr&eacute;.  Rosa Enskat does very well in a smaller but important role as Hausmeisterin (house-mistress) Bungert, the eyes and ears of the Stasi in the building where Barbara lives, always reporting on Barbara's comings and goings and always reminding her that she's being watched.  Unlike Rainer Bock's Stasi officer Sch&uuml;tz, the film makes no attempt to soften or sympathize with Enskat's Bungert, which makes her all the more effective.  Less effective is Ronald Zerhfeld's Andr&eacute;, who starts out well but increasingly comes across as being too noble and high-minded to be believed as the film goes on.  This is not however so much a fault of the actor as it is a fault of the screenplay.  I also found that Barbara's suddenly having feelings for him as the critical night approaches - to the point that it complicates her plans to escape - also a bit hard to believe, but the fault for that too lies within the script and not the actors.All that said, however, the film suffers from two big weaknesses.  The first is one of pacing.  Things move very slowly for most of the film, which, combined with the lack of a musical score, can sometimes make things drag to the point that some people may actually fall asleep.  The other, and far bigger problem, is the way in which the film ends.  I won't spoil the film for any potential viewers by revealing it, but I will say that I found it unrealistic to the point of being unbelievable, completely undermining everything that led up to it.  My wife, who actually comes from a Communist country (Vietnam), found it particularly so.  She thought the film did an excellent job of portraying what life was actually like in those days under a Communist government, where you had to be extremely careful what you said or did because the government always had people reporting on you.  But she found the ending not remotely believable, saying that no one - and especially not a professional person like a doctor - would do the things that Barbara ultimately does.Recommended for anyone interested in what life in East Germany was like for most people back then, with the caution that they may find the ending more than a little hard to believe.",3,Bleakly atmospheric period drama
