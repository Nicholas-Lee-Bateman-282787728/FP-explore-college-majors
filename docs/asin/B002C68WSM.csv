1262053,A3FJSHVW02YAK3,B002C68WSM,Michael S.,"[0, 0]","Know Your Mushrooms is a quirky documentary that mixes informational interviews, psychedelic imagery, vintage commercials, and high school-style pop quizzes and animations to provide a rather interesting overview of a segment of biology most often overshadowed by the plant and animal kingdoms. Upon first viewing, you aren't really sure what to make of the documentary as it begins with a radio broadcast and odd visual imagery that seems to have been created by somebody who might have actually been tripping on psychedelic mushrooms at the time. Despite its odd nature, the film is actually quite interesting and very informative. It certainly holds your attention, and because of these qualities would definitely be a good film for high school and/or college biology courses to use. Although the film does look into the psychedelic qualities of certain mushrooms, it isn't a documentary about drugs. Much more time is spent on mushrooms as a food source, as a medicine, and as an important part of the ecosystem. It pulls from the great knowledge of noted mycologist Gary Lincoff, but mushroom hunter Larry Evans is certainly the stand-out because of his hippy-like appearance and fun personality.",4,"Quirky, fun and informative documentary",1358208000,"01 15, 2013",2013,1201,"['Know', 'Mushrooms', 'quirky', 'documentary', 'mixes', 'informational', 'interviews', 'psychedelic', 'imagery', 'vintage', 'commercials', 'high', 'school-style', 'pop', 'quizzes', 'animations', 'provide', 'rather', 'interesting', 'overview', 'segment', 'biology', 'most', 'often', 'overshadowed', 'plant', 'animal', 'kingdoms', 'first', 'viewing', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'make', 'documentary', 'radio', 'broadcast', 'odd', 'visual', 'imagery', 'have', 'been', 'created', 'somebody', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'actually', 'been', 'tripping', 'psychedelic', 'mushrooms', 'time', 'odd', 'nature', 'film', 'actually', 'quite', 'interesting', 'very', 'informative', 'certainly', 'attention', 'qualities', 'would', 'definitely', 'be', 'good', 'film', 'high', 'school', 'and/or', 'college', 'biology', 'courses', 'use', 'film', 'look', 'psychedelic', 'qualities', 'certain', 'mushrooms', ""n't"", 'documentary', 'drugs', 'Much', 'more', 'time', 'spent', 'mushrooms', 'food', 'source', 'medicine', 'important', 'part', 'ecosystem', 'great', 'knowledge', 'noted', 'mycologist', 'Gary', 'Lincoff', 'mushroom', 'hunter', 'Larry', 'Evans', 'certainly', 'stand-out', 'hippy-like', 'appearance', 'fun', 'personality']",Know Your Mushrooms

This is a well-made, entertaining documentary that provides a good introduction to mushrooms and the people who are fascinated by them. The film is whimsical with some fun graphics that were a lot more sophisticated than I had expected from I thought would be a really rough, low-budget affair. This is a polished piece of work.

1262055,A3GIESLBKUBGZQ,B002C68WSM,Richard R. Powell,"[3, 3]","The first 5 minutes of the movie promise much. ""Wow,"" I was thinking, ""this is cheesy, but not too cheesy -- reasonably good 'special effects' and a quality documentary feel.""The film moves along nicely from there, following the various mushroom gurus and fugiphiles as they go on forays, identify mushrooms in the field, speak at festival events, cook up mushrooms, and talk about mushroom induced hallucinations.If you like colourful characters and getting to know enthusiasts with their blushingly wonky theories about the role of mushrooms in the evolution of our species, you will like the film. It has an almost tongue in cheek feel to it, a sort of halfhearted attempt to present what is clearly an eccentric subculture as objectively as possible.So, for what it is, it is entertaining and even educational with animated interludes reminiscent of Bill Nye or the Nature Nut showing a little mushroom coming out and quizzing us on our mushroom knowledge. These have a nice ""don't take this too seriously"" feel to them too.So, why not a higher rating? Frankly, this film doesn't do anything really well. It is not a straight forward documentary like a NOVA or National Geographic episode delving into the science of the mushrooms and their effects on the body, it is not a big-business-bashing muckraking expose showing the mushroom industries efforts to keep people from finding free mushrooms all on their own, and it is not a ""how-to"" video on finding, cooking, and enjoying mushrooms. It touches on all these things, but feels like the film maker never really made up his mind on what the film would be.Now I actually am fine with the ""skipping stone"" approach to documentaries, giving a general overview of the subject as a sort of aperitif to deeper investigation. Trouble is, this film skips onto some rather odd folks. The experts don't come across as either reputable or credible, except for the enthusiastic Larry Evans, who we see in the field teaching the newbies. Gary Lincoff is underwhelming and the absence of fugi superstar Paul Stamets leaves me wondering if Mr. Stamets would not have anything to do with the project, and if that is true, I wonder why?If you are curious about mushroom hunting, this film is enjoyable enough and reasonably well filmed, but if you are seriously interested in mushroom hunting, you will probably already know everything in this film, and enjoy it only as a sort of ""hmmmm, I guess I better be careful who I associate with in this subculture"" kind of way. Which is to say, I think this gives a distorted view of people interested in mushrooms.I suppose what I was hoping for was an ""All In This Tea"" and what I got was something closer to ""Religulous.""",3,"A Peek at a Subculture, and I'm not talking about the Mushrooms",1289606400,"11 13, 2010",2010,2707,"['first', '5', 'minutes', 'movie', 'promise', 'much', 'Wow', 'was', 'thinking', 'cheesy', 'not', 'too', 'cheesy', 'reasonably', 'good', ""'special"", 'effects', 'quality', 'documentary', 'feel', 'film', 'moves', 'along', 'nicely', 'there', 'following', 'various', 'mushroom', 'gurus', 'fugiphiles', 'go', 'forays', 'identify', 'mushrooms', 'field', 'speak', 'festival', 'events', 'cook', 'up', 'mushrooms', 'talk', 'mushroom', 'induced', 'hallucinations.If', 'colourful', 'characters', 'getting', 'know', 'enthusiasts', 'blushingly', 'theories', 'role', 'mushrooms', 'evolution', 'species', 'will', 'like', 'film', 'almost', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'feel', 'sort', 'halfhearted', 'attempt', 'present', 'what', 'clearly', 'eccentric', 'subculture', 'as', 'objectively', 'possible.So', 'what', 'entertaining', 'even', 'educational', 'animated', 'interludes', 'reminiscent', 'Bill', 'Nye', 'Nature', 'Nut', 'showing', 'little', 'mushroom', 'coming', 'out', 'quizzing', 'mushroom', 'knowledge', 'have', 'nice', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'feel', 'too.So', 'why', 'not', 'higher', 'rating', 'Frankly', 'film', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'really', 'well', 'not', 'straight', 'forward', 'documentary', 'NOVA', 'National', 'Geographic', 'episode', 'delving', 'science', 'mushrooms', 'effects', 'body', 'not', 'big-business-bashing', 'muckraking', 'expose', 'showing', 'mushroom', 'industries', 'efforts', 'keep', 'people', 'finding', 'free', 'mushrooms', 'own', 'not', 'how-to', 'video', 'finding', 'cooking', 'enjoying', 'mushrooms', 'things', 'feels', 'film', 'maker', 'never', 'really', 'made', 'up', 'mind', 'what', 'film', 'would', 'be.Now', 'actually', 'am', 'fine', 'skipping', 'stone', 'approach', 'documentaries', 'giving', 'general', 'overview', 'subject', 'sort', 'aperitif', 'deeper', 'investigation', 'Trouble', 'film', 'rather', 'odd', 'folks', 'experts', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'reputable', 'credible', 'enthusiastic', 'Larry', 'Evans', 'who', 'see', 'field', 'teaching', 'newbies', 'Gary', 'Lincoff', 'underwhelming', 'absence', 'fugi', 'superstar', 'Paul', 'Stamets', 'wondering', 'Mr.', 'Stamets', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'project', 'true', 'wonder', 'why', 'are', 'curious', 'mushroom', 'hunting', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'reasonably', 'well', 'filmed', 'are', 'seriously', 'interested', 'mushroom', 'hunting', 'will', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'everything', 'film', 'enjoy', 'only', 'sort', 'hmmmm', 'guess', 'better', 'be', 'careful', 'who', 'associate', 'subculture', 'kind', 'way', 'say', 'think', 'distorted', 'view', 'people', 'interested', 'mushrooms.I', 'suppose', 'what', 'was', 'hoping', 'was', 'Tea', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'something', 'closer', 'Religulous']",Know Your Mushrooms
