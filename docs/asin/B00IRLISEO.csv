1694784,A3AV1LQH5E9R4H,B00IRLISEO,"Cheryl Gress ""ChristCenteredGamer""","[2, 2]","Ragamuffin is based off the life of Rich Mullins, who was a very talented Christian singer and song writer.  Although the title is unusual, it symbolizes &#8220;the burdened, the wobbly and weak-kneed, the inconsistent, unsteady disciples... the smart people who know they are stupid... the honest disciples who admit they are scalawags&#8221;*.  Rich Mullins was a little rough around the edges but he was clearly gifted, humble and on fire for God.  This movie depicts him in an honest light and shows him struggling with loving his father, drinking and cussing.  Because of this portrayal, I don&#8217;t recommend this movie for young children.The visuals are definitely low budget; they were going for the indie/ragamuffin look. (They succeeded.)  The story however is great and the musical talent of Michael Koch who portrays Rich is top notch.  If you&#8217;re a fan of Rich Mullins and his music (Awesome God, Creed, Elijah) I highly recommend checking this movie out.",4,Great movie for the ragamuffins out there,1403913600,"06 28, 2014",2014,975,"['Ragamuffin', 'based', 'off', 'life', 'Rich', 'Mullins', 'who', 'was', 'very', 'talented', 'Christian', 'singer', 'song', 'writer', 'title', 'unusual', '8220', 'burdened', 'wobbly', 'weak-kneed', 'inconsistent', 'unsteady', 'disciples', 'smart', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'are', 'stupid', 'honest', 'disciples', 'who', 'admit', 'are', 'scalawags', '8221', '*', 'Rich', 'Mullins', 'was', 'little', 'rough', 'edges', 'was', 'clearly', 'gifted', 'humble', 'fire', 'God', 'movie', 'honest', 'light', 'struggling', 'loving', 'father', 'drinking', 'cussing', 'portrayal', 'don', '8217', 'recommend', 'movie', 'young', 'children.The', 'visuals', 'are', 'definitely', 'low', 'budget', 'were', 'going', 'indie/ragamuffin', 'look', 'succeeded', 'story', 'however', 'great', 'musical', 'talent', 'Michael', 'Koch', 'who', 'Rich', 'top', 'notch', '8217', 're', 'fan', 'Rich', 'Mullins', 'music', 'Awesome', 'God', 'Creed', 'Elijah', 'highly', 'recommend', 'checking', 'movie', 'out']",N/A
1694785,A385SBEEJ15HHJ,B00IRLISEO,Cindy Navarro,"[0, 1]","I am familiar with Rich Mullins music, but did not know as much about the person. The film portrays a man who struggled with many issues, including tobacco, alcohol, depression, and his poor relationship with his father (excellently portrayed by Mel Fair). Although the movie does seem to be a bit darker than I would like since I have heard that he had a more whimsical side, and it is obvious that he cared greatly for others, especially troubled youth, but it did help me to understand him. His music shows a man who loves God whole-heartedly, but struggles with both the church and the trappings of fame. Yet, I also found myself able to empathize with some of the personal demons Rich faced as he pursued peace with himself and with God.There were a few technical issues now and then (that I lack the knowledge to fully explain) and sometimes the time frame did not seem quite in accordance with reality of the age of the character, but it was a good overall look at Rich Mullins. The commentary tract (which gives the dvd Bonus Points from me, and added ones for the Closed Captioning!) with director David Shultz and Rich's brother, Dave (who plays a DJ interviewing Rich), explained that the story was meant to be of more how Rich would have viewed events in his life, plus some characters and stories were put in different sequence or a character would be the compilation of more than one of the people in Rich's life. Understandable. Loved the music, but I was a little surprised to learn that the singing in the film was actually done by lead actor, Michael Kohl, instead of using Rich's voice. However, it works.&#34;Disclosure (in accordance with the FTC&#8217;s 16 CFR, Part 255: &#8220;Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising&#8221;): Many thanks to Propeller Consulting, LLC for providing this.

I had no idea that Rich Mullins had so many demons in his closet and that it took most of his life to find peace and to begin conquering his addiction.  My one regret in the movie is that the actor did not have the same countenance as the real man; Rich Mullins always seemed to have such a peace to him, in everything I have seen him in.  That being said, I still feel that Michael Koch did an excellent job and performed Rich's music beautifully.  I recommend this movie to anyone who wishes to have a deeper level of faith and to walk through Rich's struggles as best as we can understand them.

1694787,A15P6JXOSIN2TG,B00IRLISEO,"Jalynn Patterson ""pattersonmom24""","[0, 0]","About the DVD:'Ragamuffin' is based on the life of Rich Mullins, a musical prodigy who rose to Christian music fame and fortune only to walk away and live on a Navajo reservation. An artistic genius, raised on a tree farm in Indiana by a callous father, Rich wrestled all of his life with the brokenness and crippling insecurity born of his childhood. A lover of Jesus and a rebel in the church, Rich refused to let his struggles with his own darkness tear him away from a God he was determined to love. As he struggled with success in Nashville and depression in Wichita, Rich desired most of all to live a life of honest and reckless faith amidst a culture of religion and conformity.About Rich Mullins:Singer and songwriter Richard Wayne &#8220;Rich&#8221; Mullins was best known for his worship song &#8220;Awesome God&#8221; which has been embraced as a modern classic by many Christians. His music has been covered by many artists, including Caedmon&#8217;s Call, Amy Grant, Jars of Clay, Michael W. Smith, Third Day, John Tesh, and Hillsong United. Mullins&#8217; musical career formally began with Zion Ministries in the late 1970&#8242;s, where he wrote music and performed with a band called Zion.  Mullins first solo hit, &#8220;Awesome God,&#8221; appeared on his third album and brought his music to a wider audience. Rich Mullins was inducted into the Hall of Fame by the Gospel Music Association (GMA) on April 29, 2014.My Review:Rich Mullins is a world renowned contemporary music artist that has shown us through his loving words how awesome our God is. With his sheer will, determination and God's almighty power he has been catapulted to where he stands today. With the odds stacked against him God was able to help Him reach his destiny. Ragamuffin, is a film based on his life and his miraculous turn around when it came to going along with God instead of against Him. A very powerful message!Being the broken man he was, he still moved on to reach greatness in the eyes of many. As a result of a rocky childhood and relationship with his father he struggled within himself to find love in his heart for Rich. And that is what this story is all about, that in spite of the uncertainties he still kept clinging to God. A film that can change lives is what this film has become and I can definitely see why. Too many times we listen to Satan's lies about ourselves and we must never forget that we are children of God and we need to always stay close by his side. Because if we do, we will reach heights way beyond our wildest dreams.Running time is 96 minutes and the suggested retail price is $19.99.

1694788,A3S71WW0FEU9DR,B00IRLISEO,Jonathan M. Davis,"[1, 2]","I didn't really start listening to Rich Mullins until The World as Best as I Remember It. Then suddenly I discovered I had a strange addiction to replaying these two albums (Vol. 1 and Vol. 2). I found myself lost in both his musical nuances as well as his lyrical poetry. And of particular note his delight in God's glory showing itself in Earth's simple yet beautiful nature rang both simplistic and delightful. As Rich released more albums I took note that he was really quite distracted by the blessedness of being broken man before a loving Abba father. The whole &#34;ragamuffin&#34; theme that showed up multiple albums strong with him and his &#34;ragamuffin band&#34; had me scratching my head, but eventually I studied the CD inserts and the lyrics and made some limited sense of it. This movie apparently aims to clarify. Rich was apparently a profoundly broken individual. And it's in that brokenness that God's love is found to be so profound.What did I think of the movie? For the most part, it was what I expected it to be, based on the trailers and the other comments. I say &#34;for the most part&#34; because there were some surprises, most of which were a little disappointing. First of all I felt that the story was just painfully depressing. It was as if Rich had no sense of Spirit-given joy in his life whatsoever. But I know that's not true. I think this movie represented only one side of Rich that honestly paints an incomplete picture of how a real &#34;hero&#34;--a broken Christian--comes to fully discover and know and richly understand the wonder of God's love. For being about 30 minutes too long I felt, it seemed disappointing that Rich's problems and emotional pain took 90% of the movie.I also had some frustrations with some of the technical issues. Being an amateur/hobbyist video editor, I noticed some bizarre warp stabilizer warping going on as soon as the movie began. There were also some darkly lit scenes that frankly should have been fully lit and made darker in post, or else use some other cameras. As characters moved around the screen in these dark scenes they'd leave a ghost trail almost like 80s VHS and CRT. This had me really surprised when I saw the &#34;making of&#34; video show them using Red cameras.The acting was good, though. Not amazing. This is not a Hollylwood blockbuster movie with Hollywood greats on the set. But for a budget film, the acting was solid.And for the most part, the story was solid, too. It made its point(s) well enough. There were a couple deleted scenes I'm not sure should have been deleted, but if you do buy this DVD you should watch the deleted scenes, that's all I can say. Overall, this is a very good story with a very good message that imperfect, broken people can relate to. And for once, this movie shows hope for the brokenness. Death in the end comes across like triumph. But then again, that's only because I know the backstory, and listened to the whole &#34;When I go I want to go out like Elijah&#34; song. Those who don't know, might miss it, and grieve in the end instead of celebrate.",4,"Not without its flaws, but a very good movie",1402876800,"06 16, 2014",2014,3090,"['did', ""n't"", 'really', 'start', 'listening', 'Rich', 'Mullins', 'World', 'as', 'Best', 'Remember', 'Then', 'suddenly', 'discovered', 'had', 'strange', 'addiction', 'replaying', 'two', 'albums', 'Vol', '1', 'Vol', '2', 'found', 'lost', 'musical', 'nuances', 'as', 'well', 'lyrical', 'poetry', 'particular', 'note', 'delight', 'God', 'glory', 'showing', 'Earth', 'simple', 'yet', 'beautiful', 'nature', 'rang', 'simplistic', 'delightful', 'Rich', 'released', 'more', 'albums', 'took', 'note', 'was', 'really', 'quite', 'distracted', 'blessedness', 'being', 'broken', 'man', 'loving', 'Abba', 'father', 'whole', '34', 'ragamuffin', '34', 'theme', 'showed', 'up', 'multiple', 'albums', 'strong', '34', 'ragamuffin', 'band', '34', 'had', 'scratching', 'head', 'eventually', 'studied', 'CD', 'inserts', 'lyrics', 'made', 'limited', 'sense', 'movie', 'apparently', 'clarify', 'Rich', 'was', 'apparently', 'profoundly', 'broken', 'individual', 'brokenness', 'God', 'love', 'found', 'be', 'so', 'profound.What', 'did', 'think', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'what', 'expected', 'be', 'based', 'trailers', 'other', 'comments', 'say', '34', 'most', 'part', '34', 'were', 'surprises', 'most', 'were', 'little', 'disappointing', 'First', 'felt', 'story', 'was', 'just', 'painfully', 'depressing', 'was', 'Rich', 'had', 'sense', 'Spirit-given', 'joy', 'life', 'whatsoever', 'know', 'not', 'true', 'think', 'movie', 'represented', 'only', 'one', 'side', 'Rich', 'honestly', 'incomplete', 'picture', 'how', 'real', '34', 'hero', '34', 'broken', 'Christian', 'fully', 'discover', 'know', 'richly', 'understand', 'wonder', 'God', 'love', 'being', '30', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'felt', 'seemed', 'disappointing', 'Rich', 'problems', 'emotional', 'pain', 'took', '90', '%', 'movie.I', 'also', 'had', 'frustrations', 'technical', 'issues', 'Being', 'amateur/hobbyist', 'video', 'editor', 'noticed', 'bizarre', 'warp', 'stabilizer', 'warping', 'going', 'as', 'soon', 'movie', 'began', 'were', 'also', 'darkly', 'lit', 'scenes', 'frankly', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'fully', 'lit', 'made', 'darker', 'post', 'else', 'use', 'other', 'cameras', 'characters', 'moved', 'screen', 'dark', 'scenes', ""'d"", 'leave', 'ghost', 'trail', 'almost', '80s', 'VHS', 'CRT', 'had', 'really', 'surprised', 'when', 'saw', '34', 'making', '34', 'video', 'show', 'using', 'Red', 'cameras.The', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'though', 'Not', 'amazing', 'not', 'Hollylwood', 'blockbuster', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'greats', 'set', 'budget', 'film', 'acting', 'was', 'solid.And', 'most', 'part', 'story', 'was', 'solid', 'too', 'made', 'point', 's', 'well', 'enough', 'were', 'couple', 'deleted', 'scenes', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'deleted', 'do', 'buy', 'DVD', 'should', 'watch', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'can', 'say', 'Overall', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'very', 'good', 'message', 'imperfect', 'broken', 'people', 'can', 'relate', 'once', 'movie', 'hope', 'brokenness', 'Death', 'end', 'triumph', 'then', 'again', 'only', 'know', 'backstory', 'listened', 'whole', '34', 'When', 'go', 'want', 'go', 'out', 'Elijah', '34', 'song', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'might', 'miss', 'grieve', 'end', 'instead', 'celebrate']",N/A

Our Abba Father. Philippians 1:6-8, For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus. For it is only right for me to feel this way about you all, because I have you in my heart, since both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of grace with me. For God is my witness, how I long for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus.&#8220;I hope that I would leave a legacy of joy. A legacy of real compassion. Because I think there is great joy in real compassion. I don&#8217;t think that you can know joy apart from caring deeply about people &#8211; caring enough about people that you actually do something.&#8221;&#8212;Rich Mullins, 1994Based on the life of the late singer-songwriter Rich Mullins, the story is told as a radio interview, from Rich at a young age to his death, according to the remembrances of his family and friends. A real person, not glossed over, Rich talked about pursuing God not religion nor expectations of man. The one question becomes, &#34;Do you believe that I loved you?&#34; The movie portrayal conflicts with the words of his music, highlighting his character flaws. Quotations by Rich Mullins point to examination of where we place our focus ~ on God or man. His joy is not shown, nor a deeper acceptance he received being loved in brokenness. I liked the connection with Brennan Manning in the film, as a mentor with Rich. The lead actor does the singing and Rich's recordings are not used. Good visual clips of Rich interwoven with the credits.The movie back cover does not contain a rating. There is cursing, smoking, and drinking portrayed in the film. Drama/biography, 137 minutes, co-produced by Rich Mullins' younger brother, Dave Mullins. DVD release date: July 8, 2014. The film seemed overly long in spots.

1694791,A6D07P6DHMXIP,B00IRLISEO,"L. Courtney ""Book Mom""","[2, 2]","I'm a child of the 80s. I know I've just revealed at least my approximate age. And as a fan of contemporary Christian music, I remember well when Rich Mullins' song Awesome God first came out. I remember the wild popularity. I loved the song just as everyone else did. And I loved Rich Mullins' other music. There was something real and authentic, something that made you feel as if he could really relate what you were thinking. His music made me think about Who God was to me.I didn't know much about Rich Mullins himself. I do remember hearing that he lived his life very simply, not in the extravagant way he could have given his popularity. And I remember feeling sadness when I heard about the end of his life in a car crash.I was grateful to have the opportunity to review the new DVD Ragamuffin: Based on the Life of Rich Mullins. The DVD is a cross between an interview and a drama. Throughout the DVD, &#34;Rich&#34; is talking about various times in his life. As he talks the DVD also portrays the story of his life. Beginning in Rich's childhood and continuing on until the very end of his life, the DVD gives a first hand look at the life of this man who wanted to serve God with all his heart but who was the first to admit that he wasn't perfect, wasn't holy.There were many things I didn't know about Rich's life. The DVD definitely has a sad tone throughout, I thought. Rich Mullins led an often difficult life. Despite his popularity, he was often haunted by the difficult things from his past. The tone made this difficult to watch at times. At the same time, I was very touched by Rich's life and testimony.I think that watching the story of his life gave me the same feeling that listening to his music always has- the feeling that I'm not perfect but that God loves me and that I'm on a journey to serve God in the best way that I know how. It was edifying to watch even if it wasn't always easy.It's a pretty long DVD- almost 2 1/2 hours. I don't think my kids would really &#34;get&#34; it because they haven't had the history of Rich Mullins' music. But all of us who are old enough to remember his touching and inspiring music can appreciate this picture of his life.",4,Touching DVD About the Life of Rich Mullins,1404432000,"07 4, 2014",2014,2193,"[""'m"", 'child', '80s', 'know', ""'ve"", 'just', 'revealed', 'least', 'approximate', 'age', 'fan', 'contemporary', 'Christian', 'music', 'remember', 'well', 'when', 'Rich', 'Mullins', 'song', 'Awesome', 'God', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'remember', 'wild', 'popularity', 'loved', 'song', 'just', 'everyone', 'else', 'did', 'loved', 'Rich', 'Mullins', 'other', 'music', 'was', 'something', 'real', 'authentic', 'something', 'made', 'feel', 'could', 'really', 'relate', 'what', 'were', 'thinking', 'music', 'made', 'think', 'Who', 'God', 'was', 'me.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'Rich', 'Mullins', 'do', 'remember', 'hearing', 'lived', 'life', 'very', 'simply', 'not', 'extravagant', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'popularity', 'remember', 'feeling', 'sadness', 'when', 'heard', 'end', 'life', 'car', 'crash.I', 'was', 'grateful', 'have', 'opportunity', 'review', 'new', 'DVD', 'Ragamuffin', 'Based', 'Life', 'Rich', 'Mullins', 'DVD', 'cross', 'interview', 'drama', 'DVD', '34', 'Rich', '34', 'talking', 'various', 'times', 'life', 'DVD', 'also', 'story', 'life', 'Beginning', 'Rich', 'childhood', 'continuing', 'very', 'end', 'life', 'DVD', 'first', 'hand', 'look', 'life', 'man', 'who', 'wanted', 'serve', 'God', 'heart', 'who', 'was', 'first', 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'was', ""n't"", 'holy.There', 'were', 'many', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Rich', 'life', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'sad', 'tone', 'thought', 'Rich', 'Mullins', 'led', 'often', 'difficult', 'life', 'popularity', 'was', 'often', 'haunted', 'difficult', 'things', 'past', 'tone', 'made', 'difficult', 'watch', 'times', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'touched', 'Rich', 'life', 'testimony.I', 'think', 'watching', 'story', 'life', 'gave', 'same', 'feeling', 'listening', 'music', 'always', 'has-', 'feeling', ""'m"", 'not', 'perfect', 'God', ""'m"", 'journey', 'serve', 'God', 'best', 'way', 'know', 'how', 'was', 'edifying', 'watch', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'easy.It', 'pretty', 'long', 'DVD-', 'almost', '2', '1/2', 'hours', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'kids', 'would', 'really', '34', 'get', '34', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'history', 'Rich', 'Mullins', 'music', 'who', 'are', 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'touching', 'inspiring', 'music', 'can', 'appreciate', 'picture', 'life']",N/A

However the trailer was so enticing I felt a pull and enlisted hubby's help (he first came to this country carrying a guitar on his back).Based on the life of Rich Mullins, this is one of the most arresting movies of faith, love and charity I have seen to date.Rich Mullins was a successful Contemporary Christian musician, known to Christians as the writer/singer of the worship anthem &#8220;Awesome God&#34;.Influenced by St Francis of Assisi, Rich Mullins was a speaker on the power of God's love and the need for redemption, lived his faith every day of his life whilst facing his many demons.Rising to the top of his profession, he eventually walked away from the pressures and lived on a Navajo reservation until his death in 1997.I was however more interested in the actual person than the depressing portrayal presented by Michael Koch in RAGAMUFFIN.Despite his struggles with substances and his bouts with despondency, Rich Mullins appeared to be someone you could not ignore. His vibrant personality made you think of your own faith and reminds us that we all come to God as ragamuffins.This is one time where I would like to urge readers not to miss the special features, a must to understand the message. And speaking about the message behind the movie, Ragamuffin is certain to appeal to youths.An excellent conversation opener, the movie of one man's struggle to live an honest faith in a materialist's society is well worth 4 stars!Disclaimer:  I received a copy of this DVD from FLYBY Promotions.

The people who exist when all the lights and cameras are gone home for the night. When they are simply all alone with their thoughts. We don't always see the real people, the brutally honest insight into what goes on and what they are really feeling on the inside.In the DVD Ragamuffin, which chronicles the life of Rich Mullins, you get to see past all the glitz and publicity to watch the rise of what it took back in the late 70s to gain the notoriety we see in our music artists today. Yet the one thing that sticks with you is the honesty in his life. Raised as a farmer who didn't quite possess the skills necessary to gain success in the eyes of his father, Rich gravitated to music in which he excelled naturally. Unfortunately he was seen as less than worthy in the eyes of his own father, which made understanding the love of God difficult. If God loves you, you should believe it. When Rich looked at that model in his own life no matter how many people told him that his real dad loved him, he found that faith hard to swallow.Throughout the movie, however, Rich never losses his honest faith with connecting with the God of the Bible. His faith is genuine and the messages he shared when playing his music in churches connected with people on a level I don't think many can achieve even now. He wasn't looking for fame, wealthy or success. He simply was looking for a place to call home. He found it briefly when he met a girl named Jess, who provided him that unconditional love, we all need to feel a part of something bigger. But when Nashville called wanting to record his songs for artists like Amy Grant, Jess gracefully bowed out, even though Rich declined to go. She knew he was destined for more and the struggles he makes to find his way in the world, I think everyone can relate to.I received Ragamuffin compliments of Millennium Entertainment and Flyby Promotions for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review and the opinions expressed in this review are strictly my own. There are simply too many good things to say about this movie but most of all is that God is genuine and He is real. The story of Rich's life shows how desperately he wanted that connection he had with God to be manifested in human form. He shares how difficult and lonely life can be at times, and I think that hits home with so many. Our lives at times have their moments when we can simply feel all alone and wondering if our one life makes any difference at all. This story of Rich's showcases just how one life can impact and cause the ripples that span long after they begin and I believe that is the message behind it all. I easily give this one a 5 out of 5 stars in my opinion.",5,An exceptional movie about finding unconditional love!,1404777600,"07 8, 2014",2014,2878,"['world', 'rising', 'music', 'stars', 'American', 'Idols', 'believe', 'fail', 'see', 'real', 'people', 'hidden', 'record', 'labels', 'recording', 'studios', 'people', 'who', 'exist', 'when', 'lights', 'cameras', 'are', 'gone', 'home', 'night', 'When', 'are', 'simply', 'alone', 'thoughts', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'see', 'real', 'people', 'brutally', 'honest', 'insight', 'what', 'what', 'are', 'really', 'feeling', 'inside.In', 'DVD', 'Ragamuffin', 'life', 'Rich', 'Mullins', 'get', 'see', 'glitz', 'publicity', 'watch', 'rise', 'what', 'took', 'back', 'late', '70s', 'gain', 'notoriety', 'see', 'music', 'today', 'one', 'thing', 'honesty', 'life', 'Raised', 'farmer', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'possess', 'skills', 'necessary', 'gain', 'success', 'eyes', 'father', 'Rich', 'gravitated', 'music', 'excelled', 'naturally', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'seen', 'less', 'worthy', 'eyes', 'own', 'father', 'made', 'understanding', 'love', 'God', 'difficult', 'God', 'should', 'believe', 'When', 'Rich', 'looked', 'model', 'own', 'life', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'told', 'real', 'dad', 'loved', 'found', 'faith', 'hard', 'swallow.Throughout', 'movie', 'however', 'Rich', 'never', 'losses', 'honest', 'faith', 'connecting', 'God', 'Bible', 'faith', 'genuine', 'messages', 'shared', 'when', 'playing', 'music', 'churches', 'connected', 'people', 'level', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'many', 'can', 'achieve', 'even', 'now', 'was', ""n't"", 'looking', 'fame', 'wealthy', 'success', 'simply', 'was', 'looking', 'place', 'call', 'home', 'found', 'briefly', 'when', 'met', 'girl', 'named', 'Jess', 'who', 'provided', 'unconditional', 'love', 'need', 'feel', 'part', 'something', 'bigger', 'when', 'Nashville', 'called', 'wanting', 'record', 'songs', 'artists', 'Amy', 'Grant', 'Jess', 'gracefully', 'bowed', 'out', 'even', 'Rich', 'declined', 'go', 'knew', 'was', 'destined', 'more', 'struggles', 'find', 'way', 'world', 'think', 'everyone', 'can', 'relate', 'to.I', 'received', 'Ragamuffin', 'compliments', 'Millennium', 'Entertainment', 'Flyby', 'Promotions', 'honest', 'review', 'did', 'not', 'receive', 'monetary', 'compensation', 'favorable', 'review', 'opinions', 'expressed', 'review', 'are', 'strictly', 'own', 'are', 'simply', 'too', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'say', 'movie', 'most', 'God', 'genuine', 'real', 'story', 'Rich', 'life', 'how', 'desperately', 'wanted', 'connection', 'had', 'God', 'be', 'manifested', 'human', 'form', 'shares', 'how', 'difficult', 'lonely', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'times', 'think', 'home', 'so', 'many', 'lives', 'times', 'have', 'moments', 'when', 'can', 'simply', 'feel', 'alone', 'wondering', 'one', 'life', 'difference', 'story', 'Rich', 'showcases', 'just', 'how', 'one', 'life', 'can', 'impact', 'cause', 'ripples', 'span', 'long', 'begin', 'believe', 'message', 'easily', 'give', 'one', '5', '5', 'stars', 'opinion']",N/A

I love how this movie depicted how he got the words to some of his more popular songs.  It makes his songs even more meaningful.  I wasn't aware of most of his dark and troubled past so this movie was very enlightening on why he seemed controversial and rebellious to some.  This is an excellent movie to see if you want to understand what withholding a father's love will do to a person.  I can only imagine what kind of man Rich would have been if his dad hadn't been so critical and unloving.  Made me want to rush home and hug and tell my kids how much I love them!

His most famous in my eyes is his song Awesome God.This story is very, very interesting and at the same time very sad. He loved the Lord, but also fought against things that brought him down. He didn&#8217;t feel loved and his Dad said things to him that really upset and hurt him throughout his life.I like how he never put people down, because he knew that God loves you even when you do something wrong. He also knew that God doesn&#8217;t care if you don&#8217;t wear a certain kind of clothes or your hair and bread weren&#8217;t always in place.This DVD is 2  hours long and I just loved it all. It kept my interest all of the way through and made me realize even though people may be in music or singing and praising the Lord they may not always be happy or have a happy life.Very good, interesting DVD that I highly recommend.
