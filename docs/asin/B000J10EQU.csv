1023259,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000J10EQU,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[1, 2]","It is inevitable that 'Superman Returns' will be compared to the series of 'Superman' movies starring Christopher Reeves that came out in the eighties, but it is best to judge this movie on its own terms.  'Superman Returns' is a fitting return for the caped crusader with advantages and disadvantages from its predecessors.  The technology and grandeur are stunning enough, and the situations he's placed into are dire enough to keep our interest for long stretches throughout.  The acting is a mixed bag, and the side melodrama, while not as compelling as 'Spiderman 2,' is interesting enough to garner its place in the movie.Superman returns after a voyage from the his home planet, Krypton, leaving a void that was filled by Lois Lane with a lover and a boy--and a world returning to injustice.  She is resentful, and he has much explaining to do, but his return is timely enough to coincide with a wrinkle in the justice system:  Lex Luther has found a loop-hole, upon which he may return to the civilized world and wreak havoc.  The causality of his criminal mayhem should raise eyebrows by motive and method:  He wishes to control the world by creating new land via small samples of crystals obtained from Superman's arctic lair.  He will lay waste with his new land creation and implement an environmental terrorism meant to wipe out billions of people and near continents, both submerged under water.  Next, he will be in charge of the new real estate.  The execution of the plot certainly creates substantial tension where the unintentional silliness fails to make us believe...It is Kevin Spacey's portrayal as Lex Luther, however, that bridges much of the credibility gap.  While Gene Hackman's portrayal was thoroughly entertaining as Luther, Spacey's is creepy and menacing.  And the directing has made all the difference.  While madcap director Richard Lester ('A Hard Day's Night', et al) made the 'Superman' series into a glorious cartoon, Bryan Singer turns 'Superman' into a foreboding spectacle.  This is not to say there aren't funny moments, but the general campiness of the Lester fare has been abandoned for a more taut adventure.  The other performances aren't as worthwhile, but they do provide a different venue.  Brandon Routh's Superman provides quiet strength, but little of Reeve's charisma.  He does the duo identities decently, but not spectacularly.  He is nerdy enough as Kent, but only exhudes the strong silent type to sustain his stature.  Similarly, Kate Bosworth's Lois Lane is attractive enough in looks and personality, but there are a few missing nuances as well. Comparisons to Margot Kidder aren't fair because she did well for Lester's carnival atmosphere.  Bosworth gives us an immediate emotional anchor for the film's plots, though. Also, sometimes the plot is fragmented, which can only be justified as a series of warm-ups for the main plot.In sum, 'Superman Returns' does to Superman what 'Batman Begins' does to Batman.  It removes the campiness, returns to basics, and starts to thrill us with ominous adventure.  Only in 'Superman Returns' it doesn't do it as well.",4,"'Superman Returns' Spectacularly, but not Flawlessly",1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,3120,"['inevitable', ""'Superman"", 'Returns', 'will', 'be', 'compared', 'series', ""'Superman"", 'movies', 'starring', 'Christopher', 'Reeves', 'came', 'out', 'eighties', 'best', 'judge', 'movie', 'own', 'terms', 'Returns', 'fitting', 'return', 'caped', 'crusader', 'advantages', 'disadvantages', 'predecessors', 'technology', 'grandeur', 'are', 'stunning', 'enough', 'situations', 'placed', 'are', 'dire', 'enough', 'keep', 'interest', 'long', 'stretches', 'acting', 'mixed', 'bag', 'side', 'melodrama', 'not', 'as', 'compelling', ""'Spiderman"", '2', 'interesting', 'enough', 'garner', 'place', 'movie.Superman', 'voyage', 'home', 'planet', 'Krypton', 'leaving', 'void', 'was', 'filled', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'lover', 'boy', 'world', 'returning', 'injustice', 'resentful', 'much', 'explaining', 'do', 'return', 'timely', 'enough', 'coincide', 'wrinkle', 'justice', 'system', 'Lex', 'Luther', 'found', 'loop-hole', 'may', 'return', 'civilized', 'world', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'causality', 'criminal', 'mayhem', 'should', 'raise', 'eyebrows', 'motive', 'method', 'control', 'world', 'creating', 'new', 'land', 'small', 'samples', 'crystals', 'obtained', 'Superman', 'arctic', 'lair', 'will', 'lay', 'waste', 'new', 'land', 'creation', 'implement', 'environmental', 'terrorism', 'meant', 'wipe', 'out', 'billions', 'people', 'near', 'continents', 'submerged', 'water', 'Next', 'will', 'be', 'charge', 'new', 'real', 'estate', 'execution', 'plot', 'certainly', 'substantial', 'tension', 'where', 'unintentional', 'silliness', 'make', 'believe', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'portrayal', 'Lex', 'Luther', 'however', 'much', 'credibility', 'gap', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'portrayal', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'Luther', 'Spacey', 'creepy', 'menacing', 'directing', 'made', 'difference', 'madcap', 'director', 'Richard', 'Lester', 'Hard', 'Day', 'Night', 'et', 'al', 'made', ""'Superman"", 'series', 'glorious', 'cartoon', 'Bryan', 'Singer', ""'Superman"", 'foreboding', 'spectacle', 'not', 'say', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny', 'moments', 'general', 'campiness', 'Lester', 'fare', 'been', 'abandoned', 'more', 'taut', 'adventure', 'other', 'performances', 'are', ""n't"", 'worthwhile', 'do', 'provide', 'different', 'venue', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'Superman', 'quiet', 'strength', 'little', 'Reeve', 'charisma', 'duo', 'identities', 'decently', 'not', 'spectacularly', 'nerdy', 'enough', 'Kent', 'only', 'strong', 'silent', 'type', 'sustain', 'stature', 'Similarly', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'attractive', 'enough', 'looks', 'personality', 'are', 'few', 'missing', 'nuances', 'as', 'well', 'Comparisons', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'are', ""n't"", 'fair', 'did', 'well', 'Lester', 'carnival', 'atmosphere', 'Bosworth', 'immediate', 'emotional', 'anchor', 'film', 'plots', 'though', 'Also', 'sometimes', 'plot', 'fragmented', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'justified', 'series', 'warm-ups', 'main', 'plot.In', 'sum', 'Returns', 'Superman', 'what', ""'Batman"", 'Batman', 'campiness', 'returns', 'basics', 'thrill', 'ominous', 'adventure', 'Only', ""'Superman"", 'Returns', ""n't"", 'do', 'as', 'well']",N/A

I'm sick of seeing the words ""lack-luster"" when people describe this movie.  It is by far full of luster and imagination.  Dedicated to Christopher and Diane Reeves and also blessed by Richard Donner, this movie brings back Superman to us when we fully need him.  An true hero to me and many others.  I understand why plenty of people like Spiderman or Batman better, because they are able to cross the line now and again and say it was for the right reason.  Superman never crosses that line and will always be the true hero to do the right thing, even if the jaded world doesn't agree.  We can look to him and be inspired to be better human beings.  Brandon Routh is a excellent Superman.  Strong and tough, but also shows his emotional hurt when he finds out that Lois has moved on with her life.  An epic story, much better seen on the big screen, but the DVD will also make you believe once more that a man can fly.

1023261,A90OOWQZR6QIP,B000J10EQU,Aaron R. Headley,"[0, 0]","Before I get started with my review i must say one thing. Im not just a mindless hater, trying to bash a fanatical fanbase of the legendary superman franchise. I liked the original movies, with the real superman christopher reeves and the real lex luthor gene hackman. with that being said here is why i really didn't like this movie.i felt it was too long and drawn out. Too much time was spent on Lousi lane crying and complaining about superman not saying goodbye before he left. she whined to her reporter friend, she whined to her husband, she whined to clark kent, she whined to her boss, and finally she whined to superman in another overly long melopdramitic flying scene. essentially making this movie a quasi chick flick/comic flick. and although the soundtrack was stunning at times, too much time was past just showing different scenery and background environments while letting the music play. yes atmoshere is great in movies but enough is enough.  basically im saying this movie was 90% melodrama and atmoshperic mumbo and 10% action.and although the action scenes where pretty cool, it is nothing we haven't seen before in a superman flick, or any other super hero flick.acting wise, i think the guy playing superman did a pretty good job, nothing compaired to reeves, but im not going to complain about that too much, he was servicable. and noone can complain about kevin spacey, he is just awesome, although i dont think he had the charisma that hackman has as lex. did not like louis lane. too whiney.story wise, this movie didnt really make much sense. it was way too out there. i mean yeah its a fantasy story and you have to use your imagination but i mean come on. lex luthor is going to basically destroy over half of the worlds population by creating the new continent and people are just going to go ""yeah lets move there"" and lex is going to make lots of money. not likely. i mean it would take years among years to make that crytallic and dark damp place to be somewhat livable. i dont think that lex would really be the type to want to put years of planning and prep to make this work. i mean most criminals want their power NOW, instant gratification. maybe im being overly harsh on a fantasy storyline, i just think they could have thought of something better, and more feasable.this movie was alright, it would have been helped a lot if they trimed about 30 minutes of melodrama away. and no i am not saying more action and less character development in movies, cause character developement is one of the most important aspects in the success of a truly great movie. however whiny crying does not constitute as strong character development in my book.",2,more like 2 and a half stars,1175904000,"04 7, 2007",2007,2683,"['get',

1023263,A1VQBHHXIKHIGS,B000J10EQU,A Customer,"[0, 2]","I thought the original Christopher Reeve movie had its moments, but reversing time was just too stupid for me to take it seriously. I didn't watch the Salkinds finish killing the franchise, although I did read about the destruction on the Agony Booth website, where they treat me like kryptonite. And as a child, I thought the comics were just stupid. Thus, I was hesitant to see this. But one of my Chinese students, whose English name is Bruce Wayne, said he preferred it to BATMAN BEGINS. I love BATMAN BEGINS. So even though Bruce Wayne's loose lips gave me one of the big plot spoilers, I decided I oughta watch it anyway. Then, in Thailand, Jan gave my DVD to a student before I had the chance. No matter. I found another last week.Superman has always required a willing suspension of disbelief that's been difficult for me to pull off. The flaws in his secret identity really come to light when Superman and Clark Kent both return from five-year absences, and look much alike, and nobody notices.His supersuit is never harmed by the stresses of his lifestyle but yields to Martha Kent's scissors, needle and thread. It's creepy watching him spy on people with super-hearing and X-ray vision, not for some ""greater good"" that he has no right to judge, but rather to sort out his love life. Being invincible is boring, kryptonite is contrived, and why were doctors giving him oxygen when he flies through space and apparently doesn't need to breathe?But Lex Luthor finally makes sense to me. I love his boat.On the whole, a fresh approach, a good reimagining of the Superman concept, and a watchable movie.

1023264,AF342RETPCOK7,B000J10EQU,Adam Lambert,"[1, 1]",This movie is Bryan Singer's third comic book adaption movie. His first two were x-men and x-men 2 which were awesome films. Now he takes a spin on Superman which does not dissapoint. He does well with the story and the action scenes and special effects were fantastic. All though the movie did have a slow start it was still a great movie.But that was kind of important to have a slow beginning because there was a lot to tell story wize like why Superman was gone for so long and how the world changed with out him. In this film you will actualy feel bad for superman there are some parts where you will be like poor Superman.  Brandon Routh makes a excellent Superman and Clark Kent. His Clark Kent though isn't as dorky as the Christopher Reeves Clark Kent.But he still pulls it off well.Lex Luther isn't as goofy as he was in the other films he is a lot more serious and sinister. but if you were a fan of the other Superman films you won't be dissapointed.

1023265,A1KSO56UWS2R7I,B000J10EQU,"Adam L. Safianow ""Kiddo""","[3, 4]","PREFACE: Another chapter in the Superman series. This latest one takes plays a few years after Clark's mysterious disappearance. It is revealed that he left to find out more about himself, and when he returned, he really found more out about everyone else, and what they have been doing while he was away.CAST/CHARACTERS:Clark Kent (Superman) - Superman Returns has a huge budget cast to go along with its huge budget visuals. Newcomer Brandon Routh is the exception. This 6'4"" actor is new to the bizz, and was mostly chosen based on his similar appearance to the original Superman actor, Christopher Reeve. His performace was surprisingly good, and don't be surprised if you start seeing him in more movies. He was successfully able to show the depths of Clark and Superman's double-life, as well as the complexity of choosing to save life.Lex Luthor - In the movie, Lex Luthor, played by Kevin Spacey, is the nemesis. With his God-complex, brilliant mind, scrude languange, and access to valuable resources, he is a very formidable adversary. Spacey does a brilliant job at playing the madman, and is probably the best acted in the film.Lois Lane - Kate Bosworth as a brunette? Yes, that's right! Bosworth plays the family-oriented Lois in this Superman. Having now popped out a pup, she has more to risk in this film. Having a previous love interest with Superman, this creates more tension between Lois, Clark, and Lois' new man, Richard. She is probably the most complex character because she has to deal with being the family-mom, the working-mom, and the clever journalist which won her a Pulitzer. Bosworth's acting was fair, but considering the difficulty of her character, I was impressed to that degree.Richard White - He creates a lot of friction. He is severly in love with Lois, who he's engaged to and doesn't seem thrilled, has to compete with Superman for the love of his life, and is trying to play father, unsuccessfully to Lois' child. He often gives Lois ultimatums, to which she does not appreciate, and he's really not that appealing of a character. Personally, I think he should've just kept doing X-Men 3, and not have been killed off; Cyclops suits him much better.All the other characters were minor with no real complexities or explination, and really won't be discussed. There are other great actors in this film though, including: Eva Marie Saint, Kal Penn, and a man that's no stranger to Superman films and shows, Jack Larson.SYNOPSIS: Superman returns after finding nothing from the remains of his Planet Krypton. When he gets there, he finds his whole world turned upside down. All the people he cared about had moved on, and one of his greatest foes was released from prison because of Superman's absence in trial. Luthor marries a terminally ill woman to get her fortune after her passing, and succeed in gaining wealth. He also went on a quest to find Superman's ""Fortress of Solitude."" When he got there, he discovered crystals that could create land mass. Because of his God-complex, he wanted to be able to do just that. The only thing that can stop him is Superman, but after stealing a large Kryptonite rock from a museum, Superman might not be a problem after all.SCRIPT/DIRECTING: The film was very well executed. For an high-budget action flick, the script was very well put together, as well as very well executed. Bryan Singer, famous for the first two X-Men movies and The Usual Suspects, used his 2nd largest movie budget of all time to his advantage, creating breathtaking cinematics, and huge sets. The movie builds up and has a great climax, as well as amazing fight scenes. He makes Superman's flying look realistic and fluid, and uses many great camera views and filters to make a very beautiful film. Not up to par with The Usual Suspects, but for the type of movie it is, Superman Returns was a great addition to his resume.DVD: I have seen the actual DVD version of the film on 720P resolution, but have not been given a chance to see the extras.

Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull has helped me put things in perspective: either you grew up with the original movies and you dig old-timey nostalgia, or you don't.The intolerable thing about Superman Returns, however, is its unjustified praise. Optimistic it may be, but that's a far cry from ""inspirational"". Superman saving a jumbo jet and then touching down in a BASEBALL FIELD? That's desperation, my friend. Talk about unadulterated Americana. Superman has always been representative of the United States and its ideals, but what I'm getting from this film is like high-fructose syrup.As a standalone movie, its still not very good. I blame Margot Kidder for her abrasive, unattractive take on Lois Lane, because now there's nowhere else to go but up. And Kate Bosworth is definitely more attractive. Sadly, she looks barely twenty five and definitely miscast in the role of a sassy reporter. Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor is passable. I would prefer a bit more depth to his character, but who am I to fight city hall? In the silver age comics, Lex was always a nutty villain and his schemes made absolutely no sense. I guess I've been spoiled by the Smallville TV series and its unique portrayal of a dark genius.I was hoping for a bit more of Singer's trademark ""realism"" (like in the X-Men movies), but there's none to be had here. I can't blame him though; few would be brave enough to smash apart the continuity from an age-old, beloved movie. Still, he could have afforded to take a few more risks here. Superman baely has any lines in the movie; he just parrots Christopher Reeves and Brando's lines from the original film! I kept waiting in vain for him to develop some kind of personality.

1023267,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B000J10EQU,A. Estes,"[7, 10]","The ""Superman"" movie franchise got off to a great start in 1978, with Richard Donner's original, starring Christopher Reeve in the title role, and co-starring Gene Hackman, Marlon Brando, and Margot Kidder. When ""Superman II"" rolled around, it hit rough waters. Production problems, combined with an end result that felt a little mixed, made for a good sequel, but trouble was apparently on the way. Following it up, were two films that put the nail in the coffin of the franchise for two decades, ""Superman III"" and ""Superman IV: The Quest For Peace."" These films are best forgotten, and such is the premise of ""Superman Returns.""Taking flight as a direct sequel to the original, with very loose ties to the second movie, ""Superman Returns"" is basically an attempt to make up for lost time and to finally show the world that Superman is truly an icon, not just some guy in a spandex costume, floating behind a blue-screen. Newcomer Brandon Routh replaces the late-Christopher Reeve, and does a splendid job. Routh is dead on in his portrayal as both Superman and Clark Kent (my only regret is that there wasn't much Kent to be found in this movie). The brilliant Kevin Spacey does Lex Luthor sweet, sweet justice, and not to do degrade Hackman's prior performances, but Spacey serves up the most threatening and diabolical version of the character. Behind the direction of Bryan Singer, who helped bring the ""X-Men"" franchise to the surface, ""Superman Returns"" is a success by nearly all accounts. Despite it's flaws, such as a mis-cast Lois Lane in Kate Bosworth, and a somewhat predictable plot, this film is easily the most action packed and enjoyable blockbuster of the year, and truly revitalizes Superman.It's sad that it took the success of another Warner property, the outstanding ""Batman Begins,"" last year to get this movie, (which had spent years in development Hell), up and off the ground, but alas, Superman has been reintroduced into the public eye, and in a big way. The best part about this movie is that not only is it true to the source material, and to the film(s) that precede it, but it's also a film that wasn't tailor made just to please the Superman faithful.

The entire movie is more serious.  Okay, Lois isn't nutty as she was with Margot Kidder, but she is facing different things.  Noel Neill, the Lois of the TV series, makes a wonderful cameo in this movie, dying in scene one.  But she was on the train in Superman, the Movie, too.  Jack Larsen, the bartender, was, for those who don't remember, Jimmy Olsen in the TV series of the 50s.  It was a nice gesture (and not an empty one either) to include them in this movie.  There is obviously room for sequels, but that's fine, because this movie lives up to the series of the past.  Singer gets sensitive performances from everyone, particularly Routh who is not just a pretty face (although he is) but also a very good actor.

Eventually,  even they'd had to admit it wasn't a first-class product for the franchise. If you like action films, this film is a two hit wonder because there's only two action sequences through out the whole movie period! The first one is Superman rescuing a a falling jet plane, the second one is him going up against a crazed gatling machine gun wielding mad man on the roof of a building, and that's about it! On the flip side let's say you like those to action scenes well, you can go on YouTube and watch them all day long over and over again, and that would be all your getting from this movie. Furthermore, if you like your Superman to fly around on screen for about an hour and a half doing absolutely nothing this films for you. As I've mentioned above my title 1978's version was a truly a classic, God bless the late actor Christopher Reeve for making Superman honorable, and not just a joke on the big screen. Alas, also in 1978 there was a much better Lex Luthor played by the brilliant actor Gene Hackman I think he got an Acad emy Award nomination for his role. Now I do not mean to sound harsh on the cast of Superman Return Brandon Routh, Kate Bosworth and Kevin Spacey which is a outstanding actor by far deserved better than this. They all did commendable jobs with what they had, which wasn't much. The plot line is dumb Superman get's a wild hair in his ass and decides to go back to his home planet of Krypton for what!?...  I have know idea? No, problem  it just takes five years to get there and back. He finds out there's nothing left of the place it's all destroyed and in ruins much like our own planet. Any way once he gets back he falls head over heels  in love again  with Lois Lane aka Kate Bosworth, on top of that they have this weird love child together. However, she's engaged to be married or already married I forgot its been along time since I've seen this movie. Superman spends most of the movie ogling and gawking at her and thinking about her basically being sprung on her the whole duration of the film. They made it into some dumb love story great! And, what is with this love child subplot it's just a waste of time. Superman should be doing what he does the best saving peoples lives and taking down the bad guys. This is what you get when you have a studio and a director that doesn't know there source material from a hole in the wall, this movie ended up being flatlined before it ever came alive.",2,I miss 1978,1372032000,"06 24, 2013",2013,2550,"['Were', 'do', 'start', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'was', 'dissapointment', 'fans', 'as', 'well', 'big', 'studio', 'honchos', 'Eventually', 'even', ""'d"", 'had', 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'first-class', 'product', 'franchise', 'like', 'action', 'films', 'film', 'two', 'hit', 'wonder', 'only', 'two', 'action', 'sequences', 'whole', 'movie', 'period', 'first', 'one', 'Superman', 'rescuing', 'falling', 'jet', 'plane', 'second', 'one', 'going', 'up', 'crazed', 'gatling', 'machine', 'gun', 'wielding', 'mad', 'man', 'roof', 'building', 'flip', 'side', 'let', 'say', 'like', 'action', 'scenes', 'well', 'can', 'go', 'YouTube', 'watch', 'day', 'long', 'over', 'over', 'again', 'would', 'be', 'getting', 'movie', 'Furthermore', 'like', 'Superman', 'fly', 'around', 'screen', 'hour', 'half', 'doing', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'films', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'title', '1978', 'version', 'was', 'truly', 'classic', 'God', 'bless', 'late', 'actor', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'making', 'Superman', 'honorable', 'not', 'just', 'joke', 'big', 'screen', 'Alas', 'also', '1978', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'played', 'brilliant', 'actor', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'think', 'got', 'Acad', 'emy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'role', 'Now', 'do', 'not', 'mean', 'sound', 'harsh', 'cast', 'Superman', 'Return', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'outstanding', 'actor', 'far', 'deserved', 'better', 'did', 'commendable', 'jobs', 'what', 'had', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'plot', 'line', 'dumb', 'Superman', 'get', 'wild', 'hair', 'ass', 'decides', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'planet', 'Krypton', 'what', 'have', 'know', 'idea', 'No', 'problem', 'just', 'five', 'years', 'get', 'there', 'back', 'out', 'nothing', 'left', 'place', 'destroyed', 'ruins', 'much', 'own', 'planet', 'way', 'back', 'head', 'heels', 'love', 'again', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'aka', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'top', 'have', 'weird', 'love', 'child', 'together', 'However', 'engaged', 'be', 'married', 'already', 'married', 'forgot', 'been', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'Superman', 'most', 'movie', 'ogling', 'gawking', 'thinking', 'basically', 'being', 'sprung', 'whole', 'duration', 'film', 'made', 'dumb', 'love', 'story', 'great', 'what', 'love', 'child', 'subplot', 'just', 'waste', 'time', 'Superman', 'should', 'be', 'doing', 'what', 'best', 'saving', 'peoples', 'lives', 'taking', 'down', 'bad', 'guys', 'what', 'get', 'when', 'have', 'studio', 'director', ""n't"", 'know', 'there', 'source', 'material', 'hole', 'wall', 'movie', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'flatlined', 'ever', 'came', 'alive']",N/A

1023280,ABRKIJ6D4V42O,B000J10EQU,"Amazon Customer ""space_hamster""","[9, 13]","Superman Returns is  a great film that won't be to everyone's tastes. Instead of focusing on Superman's fight with world-conquering Super villains, Bryan Singer has chosen to contemplate Superman's changing relationships with the woman he loves, and how it alienates him from his adopted home. Considering how bland the character has been in the past, is this theme enough to occupy two-and-a-half hours of screentime? Almost.Individually certain scenes make a strong impression - anything with Martha Kent, Lex and Kitty, Clark's return to the Daily Planet. But when I string them together in my head, they seem to slow the pace down. One minute I'm punching the air when Superman stages his return in that Baseball Stadium. The next minute I'm growing restless when I see Lois brush off her near-death experience in front of her new boyfriend.And that's my biggest growing annoyance - the way Lois is written and portrayed in this film. The Lois in the comics (and to an extent in the Animated Series), is an ambitious reporter who has a great nose for fantastic news stories. The impression I get now is a slightly harried and selfish yuppy mum trying to juggle a great career and a five-year old kid. And I know that's really really unfair on my part. Lois's life now revolves around her little boy - her friendship with Clark (not to mention everyone else) comes a very distant second. It's so very different from the relaxed patter I've come to expect from the Daily Planet staff, and I find it really really off-putting.There's enough there to enjoy that'd make me happily watch it all over again - Brandon Routh's performance as Superman, which (to me) reflects Christopher Reeve's portrayal but also brings his own sadness and pathos to the role. Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor - who I come to like more and more. And James Marsden's understated performance as Richard White, which really surprised me. The major action sequence in the film - Superman saving Air Force One, and even lifting that large island into orbit. Looking back on it, it's the fantastic opening sequence that saves it for me, because it sets the tone for the rest of the film. I also like bits and pieces of John Ottman's score. I like his ""villain theme"" much more than John Williams one. There's also one terrific use of the Superman cue when he's in the Baseball Stadium that I wish they'd included on the original soundtrack. And his new 'Love Theme' isn't too bad either - you can hear it at the very end of the film when Superman is saying goodnight to Lois.I don't think it's as good as Batman Begins - but at some points it comes pretty damn close. I feel about Superman Returns the way I do about the first X-Men. It's an above-average Superhero film which can be used as a launching platform for bigger and better things.

1023284,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B000J10EQU,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[5, 7]","Two things to start off: First, I think this film deserves three and a half stars as opposed to 3, but Amazon doesn't allow half-star ratings, and I feel that it is closer to a three than a four.  Second, this is the only Superman movie that I have seen the complete film the whole way through.  I have seen the beginning and ending of Superman II as well as a scene from the original Superman, but that is it.Anyway, Superman Returns serves as a sequel to the first two Superman films, effectively erasing the canonicity of the third and fourth films (which is probably a good thing).  After astronomers claimed that they found the location of Krypton, Superman (Brandon Routh) felt that he needed to see the remains of his home for himself and left Earth for 5 years.  In that time, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) has been released from jail, Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) has found a new lover, won a Pulitzer for an article called ""Why the World Doesn't Need Superman"", and even had a son.Upon his return to Earth, Superman finds that he has been missed by the public as well as by Lois, despite what she has said.  Immediately he is off saving people again, while his alter ego Clark Kent gets his job back at the Daily Planet.  He is upset that Lois is now engaged to Richard White (James Mardsen), the nephew of the Planet's editor Perry White (Frank Langella), but he that pales in comparison to the revelation that Lois is now a mother.  The kid, Jason (Tristan Lake Leabu), is one of the film's low points, as his point in the plot is only to cause Clark angst and then (mild spoiler warning) help Lois out of some trouble.Luthor's overall scheme once again has to do with real estate, but it doesn't seem as maniacal as the one he used in the first film (despite not seeing it, I know what his plan was).  It's true that he would once again cause numerous deaths and would amass a lot of power, I just couldn't buy into it.Overall, the movie had some very strong points and some very weak points.  Some of the strong points included the effects as well as some of the scenes of Superman's exploits that didn't have to do with Luthor's plot.  However, some of the dialogue is cringe-worthy (""I forgot how warm you are!""), Routh lacks the charisma to effectively portray Superman, Bosworth doesn't appear to have any chemistry with any of the men in her life (that includes Supes, Richard, and Jason), and, as earlier stated, the threat just doesn't seem to be as menacing as Luthor makes it out to be.  Furthermore, I found a few inconsistencies towards the end that have to do with Superman's reaction to kryptonite, but I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't say what they are.Maybe I just set myself up too much for this film.  I am a fan of Bryan Singer's work, and not just his work on his other superhero films.  While his two X-Men films are good (X2 is superb in my opinion), The Usual Suspects (also starring Kevin Spacey) is cinematic bliss, and House, which he executive produces, is a great medical drama.  Yet I was underwhelmed by this film, and I feel part of the reason is that Singer tried so hard to call back to the previous Superman films that he didn't infuse enough his his own vision into this one.It's too bad; this was shaping up to be the must-see film of the summer, but I (along with a sizable number of critics) left the theater feeling that that title will now go to the Pirates of the Caribbean sequel.",3,Superman's Return Isn't As Super As One Might Expect,1152230400,"07 7, 2006",2006,3438,"['Two', 'things', 'start', 'off', 'First', 'think', 'film', 'three', 'half', 'stars', 'opposed', '3', 'Amazon', ""n't"", 'allow', 'half-star', 'ratings', 'feel', 'closer', 'three', 'four', 'Second', 'only', 'Superman', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'complete', 'film', 'whole', 'way', 'have', 'seen', 'beginning', 'ending', 'Superman', 'II', 'as', 'well', 'scene', 'original', 'Superman', 'it.Anyway', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'sequel', 'first', 'two', 'Superman', 'films', 'effectively', 'erasing', 'canonicity', 'third', 'fourth', 'films', 'probably', 'good', 'thing', 'astronomers', 'claimed', 'found', 'location', 'Krypton', 'Superman', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'felt', 'needed', 'see', 'remains', 'home', 'left', 'Earth', '5', 'years', 'time', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'been', 'released', 'jail', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'found', 'new', 'lover', 'won', 'Pulitzer', 'article', 'called', 'Why', 'World', 'Does', ""n't"", 'Need', 'Superman', 'even', 'had', 'son.Upon', 'return', 'Earth', 'Superman', 'been', 'missed', 'public', 'as', 'well', 'Lois', 'what', 'said', 'Immediately', 'saving', 'people', 'again', 'alter', 'ego', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'job', 'back', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'upset', 'Lois', 'now', 'engaged', 'Richard', 'White', 'James', 'Mardsen', 'nephew', 'Planet', 'editor', 'Perry', 'White', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'comparison', 'revelation', 'Lois', 'now', 'mother', 'kid', 'Jason', 'Tristan', 'Lake', 'Leabu', 'one', 'film', 'low', 'points', 'point', 'plot', 'only', 'cause', 'Clark', 'angst', 'then', 'mild', 'spoiler', 'warning', 'help', 'Lois', 'trouble.Luthor', 'overall', 'scheme', 'once', 'again', 'do', 'real', 'estate', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'maniacal', 'one', 'used', 'first', 'film', 'not', 'seeing', 'know', 'what', 'plan', 'was', 'true', 'would', 'once', 'again', 'cause', 'numerous', 'deaths', 'would', 'amass', 'lot', 'power', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'buy', 'it.Overall', 'movie', 'had', 'very', 'strong', 'points', 'very', 'weak', 'points', 'strong', 'points', 'included', 'effects', 'as', 'well', 'scenes', 'Superman', 'exploits', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'Luthor', 'plot', 'However', 'dialogue', 'cringe-worthy', 'forgot', 'how', 'warm', 'are', 'Routh', 'charisma', 'effectively', 'portray', 'Superman', 'Bosworth', ""n't"", 'appear', 'have', 'chemistry', 'men', 'life', 'Supes', 'Richard', 'Jason', 'earlier', 'stated', 'threat', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'as', 'menacing', 'Luthor', 'out', 'be', 'Furthermore', 'found', 'few', 'inconsistencies', 'end', 'have', 'do', 'Superman', 'reaction', 'kryptonite', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'anything', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'what', 'are.Maybe', 'just', 'set', 'up', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'am', 'fan', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'work', 'not', 'just', 'work', 'other', 'superhero', 'films', 'two', 'X-Men', 'films', 'are', 'good', 'X2', 'superb', 'opinion', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'also', 'starring', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'cinematic', 'bliss', 'House', 'executive', 'great', 'medical', 'drama', 'was', 'underwhelmed', 'film', 'feel', 'part', 'reason', 'Singer', 'tried', 'so', 'hard', 'call', 'back', 'previous', 'Superman', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'infuse', 'enough', 'own', 'vision', 'one.It', 'too', 'bad', 'was', 'shaping', 'up', 'be', 'must-see', 'film', 'summer', 'sizable', 'number', 'critics', 'left', 'theater', 'feeling', 'title', 'will', 'now', 'go', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'sequel']",N/A

The first and greatest superhero ever.He's faster then a speeding bullet, he's more powerful than a locomotive, and can leap over tall buildings in a single bound!It's a bird! It's a plane! No! It's Superman!That's right, it's Superman, portrayed by a dozen actors in a score of films, TV Series, and too many comics to count. Superman - the superhero that will never go out of fashion, the campy, all-American, big blue boy scout.This time it's Brandon Routh portraying the Man of Steel in Superman Returns - directed by Bryan Singer. Superman Returns received a decent critical response - a 76% critical approval on Rotten Tomatoes. But it didn't make that much of a splash with audiences.But I am here to show you why Superman Returns is a great film filled with humour, emotion, awesome special effects, stunning action, first-rate acting, and a respectful attitude towards the classics. I will also take a look at the upcoming film Man of Steel, directed by Zack Snyder and compare it to the source material. Shall we begin the review?1. GREAT CAST AND CREWSuperman Returns is excellently cast, and the talent in front of and behind the camera is undeniable. The obvious place to start is with Brandon Routh - the actor who plays Superman, but I'll leave him for last.Instead, I'll start with Bryan Singer.Singer broke out on the big screen in 1995's with his second filmThe Usual Suspects- a twisty, complicated, darkly comic neo-noir starring Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, and Kevin Spacey. But Singer is known best today for his X-Men Trilogy, the first two installments of which (X-MenandX2) he directed. The X-Men trilogy starred huge casts of talented actors as Marvel's mutants, including Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, and Patrick Stewart. The 5 X-Men films to date have all been huge successes, with many regarding X2 as one of the greatest superhero films ever made. They certainly showed Singers uncanny ability to handle huge casts of characters in a single film, something shared by all great directors (think Peter Jackson).In addition to Suspects and X-Men, Singer has also directed Apt Pupil, Valkyrie, and Jack the Giant Slayer (due in theatres soon). He will direct X-Men: Days of Future Past in 2014.The rest of the great crew is rounded off by regular Singer collaborators screenwriters Michael Doherty and Dan Harris (X2), composer John Ottman (The Usual Suspects), and Newton Thomas Siegel.But the real star of the film (no pun intended) is the cast.Full review coming soon!",5,"Please Consider THIS Review, Super fans!",1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,2544,"['Kal-El', 'a.k.a', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'a.k.a', 'Superman', 'first', 'greatest', 'superhero', 'ever.He', 'faster', 'then', 'speeding', 'bullet', 'more', 'powerful', 'locomotive', 'can', 'leap', 'tall', 'buildings', 'single', 'bound', 'bird', 'plane', 'No', 'Superman', 'right', 'Superman', 'portrayed', 'dozen', 'actors', 'score', 'films', 'TV', 'Series', 'too', 'many', 'comics', 'count', 'Superman', 'superhero', 'will', 'never', 'go', 'fashion', 'campy', 'all-American', 'big', 'blue', 'scout.This', 'time', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'portraying', 'Man', 'Steel', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'directed', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'received', 'decent', 'critical', 'response', '76', '%', 'critical', 'approval', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'splash', 'audiences.But', 'am', 'here', 'show', 'why', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'great', 'film', 'filled', 'humour', 'emotion', 'awesome', 'special', 'effects', 'stunning', 'action', 'first-rate', 'acting', 'respectful', 'attitude', 'classics', 'will', 'also', 'take', 'look', 'upcoming', 'film', 'Man', 'Steel', 'directed', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'compare', 'source', 'material', 'Shall', 'begin', 'review', '1', 'GREAT', 'CAST', 'AND', 'CREWSuperman', 'Returns', 'excellently', 'cast', 'talent', 'front', 'camera', 'undeniable', 'obvious', 'place', 'start', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'actor', 'who', 'Superman', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'last.Instead', ""'ll"", 'start', 'Bryan', 'Singer.Singer', 'broke', 'out', 'big', 'screen', '1995', 'second', 'filmThe', 'Usual', 'Suspects-', 'twisty', 'complicated', 'darkly', 'comic', 'neo-noir', 'starring', 'Stephen', 'Baldwin', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Singer', 'known', 'best', 'today', 'X-Men', 'Trilogy', 'first', 'two', 'installments', 'X-MenandX2', 'directed', 'X-Men', 'trilogy', 'starred', 'huge', 'casts', 'talented', 'actors', 'Marvel', 'mutants', 'including', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', '5', 'X-Men', 'films', 'date', 'have', 'been', 'huge', 'successes', 'many', 'regarding', 'X2', 'one', 'greatest', 'superhero', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'certainly', 'showed', 'Singers', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'handle', 'huge', 'casts', 'characters', 'single', 'film', 'something', 'shared', 'great', 'directors', 'think', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'addition', 'Suspects', 'X-Men', 'Singer', 'also', 'directed', 'Apt', 'Pupil', 'Valkyrie', 'Jack', 'Giant', 'Slayer', 'due', 'theatres', 'soon', 'will', 'direct', 'X-Men', 'Days', 'Future', 'Past', '2014.The', 'rest', 'great', 'crew', 'rounded', 'off', 'regular', 'Singer', 'collaborators', 'screenwriters', 'Michael', 'Doherty', 'Dan', 'Harris', 'X2', 'composer', 'John', 'Ottman', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'Newton', 'Thomas', 'Siegel.But', 'real', 'star', 'film', 'pun', 'intended', 'cast.Full', 'review', 'coming', 'soon']",N/A

1023291,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,B000J10EQU,"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[35, 47]","I'm fortunate enough to have seen the original Superman and Superman II in the theaters when they were first released. Those two films introduced me to the fantasy world of comics and I haven't left since. Those first two films were followed up by two more inferior sequels that I don't even want to acknowledge. Since then the franchise has languished in development hell for almost two decades. Even with the early success of Tim Burton's two Batman films (again I shan't acknowledge the three inferior sequels afterwards) the Superman franchise still couldn't get back onto the silver screen. With comic book film adaptations all the rage and Batman even getting its best and truest film adaptation from 2005's Batman Begins, Superman finally gets back into the theaters within the capable hands of Bryan Singer (director of the first two X-men films).Bryan Singer must've felt like the rest of the Superman's fans since he clearly establishes the timeline of Superman Returns after Superman II. Nowhere to be found were any hints or talk of Richard Pryor's character and the evil-inducing kryptonite or any mention of Nuclear Man. No, Superman Returns follows-up Superman's climactic fight against General Zod and his followers with a sudden jaunt out into the deepest reaches of space to find his home planet of Krypton. He leaves Earth and its people without a hint of goodbye and most of all leaves the woman he loves without any warning. Lois Lane wasn't very happy about that turn of events and she tries to move on with her life partly by writing a Pulitzer Prize winning editorial proclaiming the reasons ""Why the World Doesn't Need Superman"". The film doesn't dwell too much on Superman's trip back to Earth after discovering that Krypton's not much more than a cosmic graveyard and that he truly was the Last Son of Krypton. The rest of the film was pretty much Superman trying to reintegrate himself both as Superman and as Clark Kent within Earth's society. The film does show that the world may have changed since he left for Krypton five years prior, but in the end the world truly does still need Superman.Bryan Singer tried to balance continuing the franchise as a direct sequel thus minimizing exposition and sequences introducing the origins of Superman. When he does fall back on origin themes he does so through flashback and dialogue that seemlessly blends in with the rest of the story. He also uses to great effect the late Marlon Brando's speech to his son Kal-El about his purpose and destiny. If there's a flaw to be seen in the overall product it would be the plot concocted by --- the recently released from prison --- Lex Luthor to use Superman's Kryptonian legacy to make himself ruler of the world. It's not a small feat, but the overall feel of this part of the story seems abit too much of a rehash of the original plot Luthor came-up with in the first film. This time Luthor doesn't just go for just one coastline of the Continental US, but the whole world. One would think that Luthor would've come up with something abit more creative while he was in prison. I can't fault that part of the storyline too much since it had one of the awe-inspiring sequences showing Superman's true power levels. I won't spoil the sequence, but that scene Superman showed that Superman really has earned the label he's been given since the first two films: Superman as godlike.Really, Superman Returns shows less of Superman's human side, though it shows through when he's Clark Kent, and more of his alien legacy as an outsider whose abilities and unflinching principles makes him out to be some sort of alien Messiah. This was clearly evident in Brando's speech as Jor-El in how Kal-el (Superman) was his only son and his gift to humanity who has in them the capacity to do greater good if only shown the light. I'm sure I won't be the only one to pick up on this. But it's not a wrong conclusion to arrive at. Superman's always been seen throughout his history as some sort of Christ figure. There's a scene in the film where he flies out of Earth's gravity and just floats in space looking down on Earth. It's a scene that evokes a god looking down on his charges. This has always made Superman even more of an outsider than Batman. Batman has his humanity to keep him grounded. Superman doesn't play on being human, but he knows that he'll never truly be one with the people of Earth yet he still protects them as if he is one. If there's a sequel to this film, I would dearly like to see how they take this messianic complexity of Superman and continue exploring it.But enough with the serious part of the film. Despite the flaw in parts of the film's plot, the audience reaction to the film was definitely positive. We cheered and laughed and clapped throughout the film. The action sequences didn't overwhelm the picture, but when they were there it seemed seamless. I didn't nitpick once about how Singer and crew portrayed Superman's abilities. Two action sequences --- one in the first half and the other close to the end --- had me cheering and speechless at the same time. Whatever amount of money they spent creating those scenes were money well-spent. In the end I wished that they'd added a few more action-oriented scenes, but I was glad they pulled off the ones they did have with aplomb.The performances by the two leads, Brandon Routh as Superman and Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, were more than adequate. One could see that Routh tried channeling Christopher Reeve as Superman and Clark Kent and to some success. But at times it showed too much like mimicking and less a creative impulse. I'm sure if the franchise gets a go ahead ofr a sequel Routh will get a chance to make the character his own. But his performance was well done in any case and he showed a presence that befit a Superman. Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor would've been brilliant if he'd decided upon one look for Luthor. At times he looked like an extension of Gene Hackman's diabolical car-salesman performance. Then there'd be times he resembled something close to the characterization similar in theme to Lex Luthor as savior of mankind against a godlike alien being whose mere presence hinders humanity from reaching beyond its mortal ken. In the end, Spacey's performance was great for pulling off Luthor as Superman's greatest arch-nemesis, but it would've been even greater if he had settled on which Luthor-persona to portray. Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane was serviceable. Again she didn't perform badly, but she didn't put a stamp on the character to make it her own. I think that was one thing I noticed in all the performances. They were well done, but in the end they seemed to honor the past performances of the cast from the first two films abit much instead of taking their roles and running with it. Hopefully this will change with any subsequent sequels.Even with these flaws in the film I cannot give Superman Returns a grade less than great. For even with the flaws, Superman Returns didn't disappoint and followed through on the hype surrounding it. It might not have reached the pinnacle and bar set by Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins, but it does reintroduces with a bang an iconic figure in pop-culture history back into the limelight. Superman the film franchise might have been gone from Earth far longer than the character was in the film, but he was welcome back with cheering applause from an audience both young and old. Despite the current generations ambivalence towards straight-laced heros and types, Superman Returns showed that the world truly does need Superman.",5,Bryan Singer's Superman returns with a

1023292,A2WX1UESDOLXRE,B000J10EQU,"Ashley Quinn ""Ash""","[2, 3]","I knew nothing of Superman when I went to see this. Well, I knew he wore red and blue tights and could fly. I knew he loved Lois Lane. But I've never read the comics, never seen the old movies, never watched Lois and Clark or Smallville... my life was devoid of the man of steel. Now that I've been exposed to his world, I'm addicted. I thought nothing could be better than Spider-man and Batman, what other superheroes do you need when you have Spidey and the caped crusader?? I had no idea how complex the character of Superman actually was, and I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I could, indeed, become crazily obsessed with another superhero.Superman Returns stars the amazing Brandon Routh as Superman/Clark Kent. Superman is back after having been gone for five years. He's lucky to get his old job at the Daily Planet back, where Jimmy happily greets him and gets him up to speed on everything he's missed, particularly the life of Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth)-- Superman's man squeeze who has since moved on. She even has a son and a permanent fiancee to prove it. But she really hasn't moved on; she's completely hung up on Superman, of course! Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is planning to use crystals and kryptonite in his next scheme, hoping to kill Superman and create a new continent that will belong solely to, who else, himself.There's lots going on in this movie, as if the filmmakers were trying to make up for lost time in the Superman franchise. It loses points there. And the mis-use of Lane's child also loses points. The kid could've been an excellent plot device, as well as an engaging character, but he does little but sit and stare and look kinda creepy. But it's still a great movie. Full of action and romance and tortured souls.Routh is practically the poster boy of All-American goodness-- his bright smile and eyes, that perfectly coifed hair, that manly physique. He plays the role of Superman with just enough torture, just enough charisma, just enough cheesiness, that it works to perfection. Bosworth should've played the role of Lois with a bit more spunk. I love Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor. He's menacing and cold, but idiotic and funny. And Lex's girl Kitty (Parker Posey) is just plain hilarious, delivering the movies more lighter and funnier moments just when you need them.Awesome summer fare. Awesome anytime fare.

1023293,A3FVAWZNKW9GX,B000J10EQU,"A.Trendl HungarianBookstore.com ""What should ...","[3, 7]","Everyone and the guy next to them at the bar has an opinion about this one. I liked it, hope you see it, and let it be what is. It is not everything I want in a Superman movie, but it was plenty of fun to see.""Superman Returns"" has been packed with pre-release hype. How can a Superman movie ever meet its hype? The hype for each movie has been building ever since Kal El first walked the Smallville cornfields in a comic book.The trouble with older viewers, like myself (near 40) is we grew up on the Christopher Reeve/Gene Hackman version, and watched reruns of George Reeves' TV version. Add that to years of comic book reading, cartoons and wondering what it would be like to fly, and our expectations are tough to meet.The Plot, in Short:Superman comes back to Earth after five years of soul-searching, looking for the remains of Krypton. Lois is living with a guy, Perry's nephew, and has a young son. Lex is released from prison, and is out to get his life back as top bad guy with a plan to build a new continent. Clark Kent returns to his job at the Daily Planet.Lex's experiments cause a huge blackout, endangering, among other things, Lois who is on a plane that will launch a space shuttle. Superman saves the day, and the world applauds his glorious return.Lex coordinates a heist of Kryptonite, steals some crystals from the Fortress of Solitude and begins on his new continent campaign.Can Superman stop the destruction of most of the modern world? Can he save the lives of billions of people? Will Lois survive Lex's efforts to kill her? Will Lex succeed in killing Superman with Kryptonite?""Superman Returns"" has the makings of beginning a great new franchise, but not because it is a great movie. It is good. Very good. Fun, active, occasionally funny, and usually interesting. It follows the strong themes: Patriotism, good is good, bad is bad, and crime is a world problem that needs a hero. It is replete with Christian and mythical symbols, from Jesus Christ, to Atlas, to Loki. It is filled with heroics we expect from the man dressed in red, white and blue tights.However, it comes off as a different vision than what I hoped. Superman isn't as masculine, Clark isn't as awkward, Lex isn't as ""love to hate."" It seems as if the softer characters are segued from the TV series ""Smallville,"" and not the traditional Superman I remember.Lex is still the bad guy. He still wants to rule the world. He still has a devious plan to pull it off, and is still surrounded by less than bright lackeys. Kevin Spacey's Lex isn't bad enough to convince me he is so terrible. I like him too much.Lois is still love-torn about Superman, and still disregards affection for Clark, but Kate Bosworth does not seem enough like a journalist who could win a Pulitzer Prize for ""Why the World No Longer Needs Superman."" She lacks that spark of brilliant hard-work.Perry Mason isn't edgy enough. J. Jonah Jameson of Peter Parker's Daily Bugle comes off far better as that guy in charge persona. Mason is too easily pushed-off.A few twists are worked in that reduced my view of the perfectly wholesome Superman. I need to leave off why, but as the writers and directors of the movie built in Christian imagery (Superman is a world savior, he lives his life as a sacrifice for the world there's a second coming, some Trinitarian concepts, I could on), they hurt the image. Maybe this is an attempt to create a more human character. Spiderman's movies have done amazingly well humanizing his persona.I have no doubt we will see more of this Superman. Whether Lex returns in the next movie I suppose depends on finding a believable bad guy. Lex is a good model to start from, but our man in tights has a long history to draw from. There is more story in the canon, and I hope to be there in the seats.I fully recommend ""Superman Returns.""Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com",4,"Supe's On: Superman is Very Good, Not Great",1152316800,"07 8, 2006",2006,3878,"['Everyone', 'guy', 'next', 'bar', 'opinion', 'one', 'liked', 'hope', 'see', 'let', 'be', 'what', 'not', 'everything', 'want', 'Superman', 'movie', 'was', 'plenty', 'fun', 'see', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'been', 'packed', 'pre-release', 'hype', 'How', 'can', 'Superman', 'movie', 'ever', 'meet', 'hype', 'hype', 'movie', 'been', 'building', 'ever', 'Kal', 'El', 'first', 'walked', 'Smallville', 'cornfields', 'comic', 'book.The', 'trouble', 'older', 'viewers', '40', 'grew', 'up', 'Christopher', 'Reeve/Gene', 'Hackman', 'version', 'watched', 'reruns', 'George', 'Reeves', 'TV', 'version', 'Add', 'years', 'comic', 'book', 'reading', 'cartoons', 'wondering', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'fly', 'expectations', 'are', 'tough', 'meet.The', 'Plot', 'Short', 'Superman', 'back', 'Earth', 'five', 'years', 'soul-searching', 'looking', 'remains', 'Krypton', 'Lois', 'living', 'guy', 'Perry', 'nephew', 'young', 'son', 'Lex', 'released', 'prison', 'out', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'top', 'bad', 'guy', 'plan', 'build', 'new', 'continent', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'job', 'Daily', 'Planet.Lex', 'experiments', 'cause', 'huge', 'blackout', 'endangering', 'other', 'things', 'Lois', 'who', 'plane', 'will', 'launch', 'space', 'shuttle', 'Superman', 'day', 'world', 'glorious', 'return.Lex', 'heist', 'Kryptonite', 'crystals', 'Fortress', 'Solitude', 'new', 'continent', 'campaign.Can', 'Superman', 'stop', 'destruction', 'most', 'modern', 'world', 'Can', 'save', 'lives', 'billions', 'people', 'Will', 'Lois', 'survive', 'Lex', 'efforts', 'kill', 'Will', 'Lex', 'succeed', 'killing', 'Superman', 'Kryptonite', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'makings', 'beginning', 'great', 'new', 'franchise', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'good', 'Very', 'good', 'Fun', 'active', 'occasionally', 'funny', 'usually', 'interesting', 'strong', 'themes', 'Patriotism', 'good', 'good', 'bad', 'bad', 'crime', 'world', 'problem', 'hero', 'replete', 'Christian', 'mythical', 'symbols', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Atlas', 'Loki', 'filled', 'heroics', 'expect', 'man', 'dressed', 'red', 'white', 'blue', 'tights.However', 'off', 'different', 'vision', 'what', 'hoped', 'Superman', ""n't"", 'as', 'masculine', 'Clark', ""n't"", 'as', 'awkward', 'Lex', ""n't"", 'love', 'hate', 'softer', 'characters', 'are', 'segued', 'TV', 'series', 'Smallville', 'not', 'traditional', 'Superman', 'remember.Lex', 'still', 'bad', 'guy', 'still', 'rule', 'world', 'still', 'devious', 'plan', 'pull', 'off', 'still', 'surrounded', 'less', 'bright', 'lackeys', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Lex', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'convince', 'so', 'terrible', 'too', 'much.Lois', 'still', 'love-torn', 'Superman', 'still', 'disregards', 'affection', 'Clark', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'not', 'seem', 'enough', 'journalist', 'who', 'could', 'win', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'Why', 'World', 'No', 'Longer', 'Needs', 'Superman', 'spark', 'brilliant', 'hard-work.Perry', 'Mason', ""n't"", 'edgy', 'enough', 'J.', 'Jonah', 'Jameson', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Daily', 'Bugle', 'off', 'far', 'better', 'guy', 'charge', 'persona', 'Mason', 'too', 'easily', 'pushed-off.A', 'few', 'twists', 'are', 'worked', 'reduced', 'view', 'perfectly', 'wholesome', 'Superman', 'need', 'leave', 'off', 'why', 'writers', 'directors', 'movie', 'built', 'Christian', 'imagery', 'Superman', 'world', 'savior', 'life', 'sacrifice', 'world', 'second', 'coming', 'Trinitarian', 'concepts', 'could', 'hurt', 'image', 'Maybe', 'attempt', 'create', 'more', 'human', 'character', 'Spiderman', 'movies', 'have', 'done', 'amazingly', 'well', 'humanizing', 'persona.I', 'have', 'doubt', 'will', 'see', 'more', 'Superman', 'Whether', 'Lex', 'next', 'movie', 'suppose', 'depends', 'finding', 'believable', 'bad', 'guy', 'Lex', 'good', 'model', 'start', 'man', 'tights', 'long', 'history', 'draw', 'more', 'story', 'canon', 'hope', 'be', 'there', 'seats.I', 'fully', 'recommend', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'Anthony', 'Trendleditor', 'HungarianBookstore.com']",N/A

The special effects, especially on HD DVD, are spectacular. One scene showing a crashing plane wherein Kal El attempts to stop the crash in mid-air, you can see the rippling of aluminum on the wings as Superman slows the plane's decent. This along with mind blowing audio on your 5.1 (or more) stereo system brings it right into your living room in a way that brings you into the movie unlike ever before. This is one of many such scenes where the latest tech in movieland is making the unbelievable seemingly realistic--or at least you want it to be real after watching it. The character portrayals by the ""new"" Superman actor and the rest of the cast were well chosen, and giving Brandon Routh a chance to show his stuff was a match made in heaven when it came to giving him the role. Remember, there was another actor who came out of no where to play the Man of Steel years ago who most of us had never heard of then, and from that point on we were convinced that a ""man could fly"".

1023301,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B000J10EQU,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[5, 7]","Let me start off by saying that the first two Chris Reeve films were the first movies I ever saw as a little boy. They changed me. Superman and the films sculpted my entire childhood. 19 years later, we get to witness his return. And what a wonderful return. By now, you probably already know the details of the film. Superman comes back after 5 years, Lois Lane has moved on and has a kid and a fiancee, and Lex Luthor is plotting a new real estate scheme involving Superman. But really, how is the film itself?. Folks, I had a great time with this movie. It's big, it's breathtaking, and makes you happy. Superman is back, and we couldn't be happier. Brandon Routh is wonderful. I saw Chris Reeve in him early on, but it doesn't last long. He becomes Clark/Superman and makes it his own. Spacey is wonderful as Luthor. There is some humor there, but this is not Gene Hackman or Michael Rosenbaum. This Lex is nastier and deadlier. Bosworth does well, is beautiful, but doesn't have much beyond being hurt over Superman's disappearance and being the damsel in distress. Story wise, it's out there(at least the Lex part, but does one come to these films for intricate plots?. John Williams' theme and other familiar Superman scores pop up, and they really take you back and make this film soar. The effects are not only astonishing and visually stunning, but some are just breathtaking. The look of the film is beautiful and so well detailed and planned out. The movie is just superb looking. Some complain the film is too long, light on action, and moves slow. The movie is long, but this shouldn't be a problem to anyone. Light on action?. If you call the chilling and mesmerizing airplane sequence, roof top gun fire, earthquake, water rescue, and more and more light on action. Folks, this movie isn't light on anything. There are a number of homages to Richard Donner's film, and they will bring smiles to any true Superman fan. How about Lois' kid?. The boy is great. Just a normal boy who isn't forced to be cute or whatnot. A great kid and a great kid actor. There are a number of memorable moments here that aren't soon to be forgotten. The airplane sequence is incredible and the best sequence in any Superman movie. I could go on. Do I have complaints?. Very, very minor ones. I would've liked more scenes that were cut in Smallville(James Karen must be ticked)back in, and the last half seemed kind of dark. Like it was a ""Batman"" film or something. Basically, my gripes are meaningless to the greatness of the film. The movie is dedicated to the memory of Chris and Dana Reeve. Sadly, this comes after the end credits when it should of come before, when more people would see it. Noel Neill and Jack Larson are along for the ride as well. And what a ride. Superman Returns is filled with wonderful humor, real, genuine heart and emotion, wonderful set pieces and score and imagery. This is one summer blockbuster that justifies the term.

1023303,A1NSMQIF1C2VCE,B000J10EQU,Beau Yarbrough,"[152, 204]","I went into the movie with a lot of skepticism. Star Wars fans all seemed to hypnotize themselves into liking Revenge of the Sith, and I was concerned that so many comic fans liking the new Superman movie was something similar. In this case, I needn't have worried.In the end, I only have minor quibbles. Everything I was worried about (the kid, Lois being engaged) worked out great, the Super stuff was beyond awesome and the visceral impact of seeing Superman ""return"" five years after 9/11 was weirdly cathartic: I haven't been to a superhero movie where a lot of people in the audience were crying before, but people were absolutely bawling when Superman was re-revealed to the world after the first big rescue of the movie.Brandon Routh isn't the world's greatest actor, but neither was Christopher Reeve. But both had the decency that Superman (especially the Cary Bates-drawn Superman of the 1970s radiated) requires. Worst haircut ever, though.Kate Bosworth, while not my first choice for Lois, made the character semi-appealing to me for the first time ever (Action Comics was my very first comic book and I subscribed to Superman with my allowance money through the 1970s), although at the end of the day, she's still kind of a bitch. But Singer clearly saw Lois Lane as Katherine Hepburn in Bringing Up Baby, and Bosworth was even dressed the part. That sort of manic, well-meaning but steam-rolling character actually could make Lois charming, if the writing ever fully catches up to the interpretation (it never has in the comics -- there Lana Lang was always clearly the better love interest, Betty to Lois' Veronica).Kevin Spacey split the difference with Gene Hackman's over the top version of Lex Luthor (did I mention that this film is an explicit sequel to the Christopher Reeve movies?) and a more realistic Luthor for an audience that has seen Oz and the Sopranos. His comments about prison were a great grounding in reality and his personal attack on Superman at the edge of the cliff (you'll know it when you see it) is one of the great iconic images that I suspect will be recycled in the comic books for years to come.The rest of the cast was fine, although I think Frank Langella was badly miscast -- sorry, Frank, but you're a bad guy, not a generic cipher but generally friendly editor type. But boy, has Parker Posey fallen from her indie film queen days.Spider-Man's Daily Bugle was always more realistic as a newspaper (even if that newspaper was the New York Post) than Superman's Daily Planet, and this movie was the first time the Planet seemed like an actual newspaper (the LA Times, in point of fact, down to a lot of the decorations in the Planet building), although Lois asking questions that were answered in the press packet about the shuttle was annoying. (Although maybe only to me.)I think the twist everyone saw coming was handled very well, and Lois' fiance, rather than being an anchor around the neck of this film, actually added a lot to the proceedings from where I'm sitting, because it definitely gave the feeling that life had moved on and here was a guy that the audience couldn't really dislike and who fills the roles that Clark left empty in both of his personas when he left Earth. (It also proves that he annoyed me as Cyclops in the X-Men movies because Cyclops is annoying, not because the actor is. Cyclops has always sucked.)Without question, though, this is Superman at his most Super in any film or television show.

1023305,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B000J10EQU,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[7, 11]","""Superman Returns"", the long-awaited NEW chapter of the Superman Saga, rewrites Superman's cinema history, occurring after the events of ""Superman II"" (III and IV have been thankfully discarded), and a 5-year absence of the Man of Steel, as he explored the remains of Krypton, searching for something tangible from his past. The film introduces Brandon Routh (1979- ) as the latest incarnation of Krypton's Last Son, bearing an uncanny resemblance to Christopher Reeve while in the Kent identity, and an aloof, almost Christ-like benevolence as Superman.Director Bryan Singer and writers Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris (""X-Men"" I and II) wanted to create not only an original new chapter in the Saga, but a sincere homage to Richard Donner's definitive first ""Superman"", as well, digitally inserting clips of Marlon Brando as Jor-El, utilizing John Williams' famous theme (for the fifth time in the franchise), showing pictures of 'Pa Kent' Glenn Ford on the the Kent Farm's mantle, and repeating key dialog from the first film (Superman's well-known advice about flying brought laughter and applause from theater audiences). While ""Superman II"" and ""Superman III"" composer Ken Thorne, and ""Superman IV"" composer Alexander Courage (who wrote the original ""Star Trek"" TV theme), had been hamstrung, creatively, by being forced to simply 'adapt' John Williams' soaring music into the sequels' storylines (with decreasing success, in each film), frequent Singer composer John Ottman actually expanded upon Williams' vision, adding his own themes and motifs, creating a score even more vaulting, heroic, and spiritual.To those critics who would claim ""Superman Returns"" followed the first Superman film too slavishly, there was a major change, barely noticed when the film debuted; the 'take' on the Man of Steel's superpowers came from the mid-eighties' comic book revamp of the character...No longer did Kal-El come to Earth already possessing ""Powers and Abilities Far Beyond Mortal Men""; he, instead, was a Kryptonian solar ""battery"", powered by Earth's yellow sun, who would not manifest his abilities until sufficiently 'charged' (which was why young Clark would be seen in the film wearing glasses; he actually needed them, as he was quite frail...as would any child be, of Kryptonian heritage...baby Kal-El could never have lifted Pa Kent's truck, saving his life, in this version!)Superman would soon find that things had changed dramatically in his absence. Lois Lane (portrayed by Kate Bosworth as much calmer and more level-headed than Margot Kidder, though incongruously younger-looking), feeling betrayed by his never having said goodbye, has won a Pulitzer Prize for her editorial ""Why the World Doesn't Need Superman"", now shares her life with Perry White's nephew, Richard (""X-Men"" star James Marsden), and has a frail five-year-old son (portrayed by young Tristan Lake Leabu, who is a pivotal character in the plotline). Lex Luthor (a very engaging if sinister Kevin Spacey), long released from custody (since key witness Superman never appeared at his trial to testify), bilks an aged millionairess (legendary 'Lois Lane' Noel Neill) on her deathbed, and uses his new fortune to return to the Fortress of Solitude and steal the Krypton crystals in the 'ultimate' land scheme. The only friendly faces around are his stepmother, Martha Kent (the always wonderful Eva Marie Saint), Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington), who, in a nostalgic scene, takes Clark to a bar run by Jack (TV's original 'Jimmy Olsen') Larson, and Perry White (played with rumpled charm and a twinkle in his eye, by Frank Langella).After a truly spectacular rescue sequence, involving a space shuttle, a disintegrating airplane, and a stadium full of people, Superman regains the public's confidence (another scene that brought cheers from the theater audience, the night I viewed the film)...but Lois would require far more time...and Luthor plans to kill billions, beginning with Superman.""Superman Returns"" is a stunning, brilliantly conceived achievement, offering not only the expected (and superbly created) 'super heroics', but a deeply satisfying, uplifting 'morality tale', of life, death, and redemption, as well. Brandon Routh, while not as charismatic as Christopher Reeve, proves himself more than capable as the Man of Steel (although I DO prefer the old Superman uniform over the Speedo-inspired new look!)While I believe the first Christopher Reeve ""Superman"" movie is still the best film of the series, thus far, this newest production runs a very close second, in my opinion...With generally enthusiastic reviews, and a world-wide box office gross well over $350,000,000, there is definitely life in the Superman franchise, yet!",5,Bryan Singer's Soaring Vision of the Man of

Superman would never leave earth without telling Lois, Two. If this movie really took place after the Richard Lester Superman II, he broke his promise. Because before he flew off the roof of the white house, he informed the president he wouldn't let us down again. But yet in this movie, he just leaves, and appearently leaves Lois with a kid, which is his. OOps did I spoil anything, I agree with some of the other reviews, this movies acts like it's ashamed to be a Comic book movie, and tries to be serious. While Bryan Singer did an excellent job with the X-Men movies, he clearly shows he has no idea how to handle Superman, it was a rehash of the first Christopher Reeve Superman movie. And for those who just let this movie get by with a pass, shame on you, This movie's idiocy was shoved into one scene. The infamous krypton island scene, now people have tried to explain it away, but you can't really fix bad scriptwriting, particularly when you establish rules in a movie. You can't just abandon them five minutes later in the movie, now when Superman lands on the island. He immediately loses his powers, gets beat up by Luthor's henchmen, then gets shived, but after Lois rescues him. He flies into the sun, recharges. And flies back to the island, but flies under it. Now here's where the problem arrives, Superman is protected from Kryptonite by wearing LEAD. NOT MUD, and he still has his powers, even after he's flying the island into space and his protection is falling away leaving him exposed to the Kryptonite, is he effected, Naw. Now once he tosses it into space, we get a drama scene, by the way. This movie is full of them, anyway he falls back to earth.

Unfortunately I wasn't able to get to the theatre in time (my local Imax is two hours away).I thought I was just going to have to suffer and watch it in regular 2-D until I found out there is a new type of 3-D glasses that work on regular movies. I was amazed!TV Eyes 3-D Glasses: Watch any movie in 3-DIt didn't look like the old red/green 3-D, for one it didn't mess up the colors, but it did make the picture look clearer and deeper and the people looked more solid. It didn't jump out of the screen at me like it would have at Imax, but then I don't have a thirty foot television either.What was really great about Superman Returns was that parts of the movie had been deliberately made for 3-D, so the effect looked especially good on those parts.  But I also got to watch the rest of the movie in 3-D too, which I wouldn't have got to do at Imax.The scene where Superman is catching the airplane looked great. In fact, all the flying scenes looked better. I've watched the movie in regular 2-D (it's just a regular dvd after all) and somehow when you watch it in 3-D it looks more like he's really up there in the sky, it seems like he has more weight and could really fall.  When you see it in 2-D he's just sort of stuck in the picture, like he's pasted onto the sky.Considering they had a new actor playing Superman I thought he did a really wonderful job. Not only was he trying to portray and upbeat, modern version of Superman, but he was also trying to be Christopher Reeves at the same time. He did a superb job.  I always hated in the old movies how they had Clark Kent being a dork, and Lex Luthor wasn't much better, but in this new version they're more believable.  Still a bit over the top at times, but then they are based on comic book characters.  And at least Luthor is bald.  Actually the actor they got to play him was perfect for the part, he even looked like the Luthor I remember from the old 80's comics, a bit stocky and bald as an egg, but carrying it offwith power and style.I really loved all the sly references to the movie they put in there. I didn't even notice a lot of them the first time because they were done so smooth, they didn't feel out of context at all.And you can really tell that the director was a comic book fan, there are several scenes in the movie taken directly from the comics. The scene where Superman stops the womans car, and has to put it down gently, front end first, is right off the cover of the very first Superman Action comic book.  And the scene where Superman is flying down into his Fortress of Solitude, one leg sort of drawn up, and most of him in shadow, is almost exactly a rendition of one of the more modern Superman iconic posters.They did a far better job on this movie than I expected.  There's more human warmth and struggle to it than you'd expect from a superhero movie.

Lynch ""the_onewhoknows""","[1, 4]","""It's better to burn out,'cause rust never sleeps.""- Neil YoungHere's one case where too much rust makes me hopeful that something can finally be put to sleep.  It's time to euthanize Superman and spare the audiences all the misery.The special effects and technical aspects of this movie are excellent. But over-reliance on computer generated imagery makes the movie as flat and lifeless as a video game or a soap advertisement.  Movies are about stories, action, characters, conflict and resolution.  Those elements are all missing on-screen.Among the cast of characters, this movie's focus is not on 'Superman', it's on 'Lois Lane' (Kate Bosworth).The dialogue between the characters is completely moronic -- most comic books and 'graphic novels' contain better stuff.  The ONLY good line of dialogue in the entire 154 minutes is Lois Lane's  double entendre ""... I've done Superman ..."". Unfortunately, even that line is wasted and all potential for sparks of life on screen are completely dissipated. The rest of the dialogue is totally forgettable tripe.To succeed, a super-hero movie needs a super-villain. As 'Lex Luthor', Kevin Spacey is laughably bad. He's not villainous at all; 'Lex Luthor' here is just a disturbed con artist who can't even figure out how to enjoy a swindled fortune. Mike Meyers was a more convincing villain as ""Dr. Evil"" in the Austin Powers movies -- and those were intentional farces.The most revealing scene in the movie comes toward the end, when Lois Lane sits down to write ""Why The World Still Needs Superman"", and can't think of anything to type. It definitely sums up this film's central problem.The Superman actor's performance in this film is a complete failure.  He's no 'All American' super-hero' just a West Hollywood or Greenwich Village hero, at best. Forget 'truth, justice & The American Way' here; Brandon Routh's portrayal of Superman is the kind that draws comments like ""... by the way, he's never had a real girlfriend ..."".If there is a sequel, the producers need to get a real director, find some convincing actors, and hire a screenplay writer whose literary breadth & depth doesn't require Computer-Generated-Imagery to distract everyone's attentions from the lack of content elsewhere.",2,SUPERMAN - Man Of Steel rusts out,1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,2245,"['better', 'burn', 'out', 'rust', 'never', 'sleeps', 'Neil', 'YoungHere', 'one', 'case', 'where', 'too', 'much', 'rust', 'hopeful', 'something', 'can', 'finally', 'be', 'put', 'sleep', 'time', 'euthanize', 'Superman', 'spare', 'audiences', 'misery.The', 'special', 'effects', 'technical', 'aspects', 'movie', 'are', 'excellent', 'over-reliance', 'computer', 'generated', 'imagery', 'movie', 'flat', 'lifeless', 'video', 'game', 'soap', 'advertisement', 'Movies', 'are', 'stories', 'action', 'characters', 'conflict', 'resolution', 'elements', 'are', 'missing', 'on-screen.Among', 'cast', 'characters', 'movie', 'focus', 'not', ""'Superman"", ""'Lois"", 'Lane', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', '.The', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'completely', 'moronic', 'most', 'comic', 'books', ""'graphic"", 'novels', 'contain', 'better', 'stuff', 'ONLY', 'good', 'line', 'dialogue', 'entire', '154', 'minutes', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'double', 'entendre', ""'ve"", 'done', 'Superman', 'Unfortunately', 'even', 'line', 'wasted', 'potential', 'sparks', 'life', 'screen', 'are', 'completely', 'dissipated', 'rest', 'dialogue', 'totally', 'forgettable', 'tripe.To', 'succeed', 'super-hero', 'movie', 'super-villain', ""'Lex"", 'Luthor', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'laughably', 'bad', 'not', 'villainous', 'Luthor', 'here', 'just', 'disturbed', 'con', 'artist', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'enjoy', 'swindled', 'fortune', 'Mike', 'Meyers', 'was', 'more', 'convincing', 'villain', 'Dr', 'Evil', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'movies', 'were', 'intentional', 'farces.The', 'most', 'revealing', 'scene', 'movie', 'end', 'when', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'down', 'write', 'Why', 'World', 'Still', 'Superman', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'type', 'definitely', 'sums', 'up', 'film', 'central', 'problem.The', 'Superman', 'actor', 'performance', 'film', 'complete', 'failure', ""'All"", 'American', 'super-hero', 'just', 'West', 'Hollywood', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'hero', 'best', 'Forget', ""'truth"", 'justice', 'American', 'Way', 'here', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'portrayal', 'Superman', 'kind', 'comments', 'way', 'never', 'had', 'real', 'girlfriend', '.If', 'sequel', 'producers', 'need', 'get', 'real', 'director', 'find', 'convincing', 'actors', 'hire', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'literary', 'breadth', 'depth', ""n't"", 'require', 'Computer-Generated-Imagery', 'distract', 'everyone', 'attentions', 'lack', 'content', 'elsewhere']",N/A
1023312,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000J10EQU,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[4, 7]","SUPERMAN RETURNS is a good/bad film. What this means is that there are good things within the film that outweigh the bad.Because positive reviews should end on an upbeat, this review will cover the negatives first then delve into the brighter side of the movie.But first, a little history...Superman (Brandon Routh) has returned to Earth after a five year absence. He traveled to Krypton to see if it was really gone and if he was truly alone as a species. Rest assured, he is. Nothing of Krypton -- save himself and a few asteroids -- remains. Returning to Earth isn't easy, either. Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth, BEYOND THE SEA) feels jilted because he'd left without saying goodbye. And she has a new beau ...and child! Jason (Tristan Lake Leabu) is this unique young boy and if you're observant you can figure out a few things rather quickly (for instance, add up the child's age and pay attention to a few subtle clues). Also, due to Superman's abrupt disappearance five years ago, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey, THE USUAL SUSPECTS) got a lesser sentence because the Man of Steel wasn't around to corroborate evidence against him. And now Lex is on the loose, trying once again to wrangle some illegal and deadly real estate dealings against the people of America.The bad: This story has been done. If you've seen the original Superman film (Christopher Reeves, 1978) you know the story all too well: Lex Luthor, Gene Hackman, wants to shove California into the sea so that he can be a land tycoon but first he has to get rid of Superman, yada, yada, yada... I'm sure some of this may have been done intentionally, as a sort of homage to that first film (more on that in a minute, too), but here it just felt very unoriginal.Casting. I can see why they picked Brandon Routh as Superman. He's good-looking, has a sort of chiseled quality to him, and he's got that boyish charm. The boyish charm is the biggest problem. Since he's now five years older, and perhaps paternally bound, a fatherish figure would seem more appropriate. Mr. Routh looks younger than Chris Reeves did during the first Superman film. That's a problem. In fact, everyone looks younger, not older. Even Frank Langella's character looks younger than Jackie Cooper (the original Mr. White).The Script. It's corny. Sorry but had to say it. The dialogue is often stilted (""All I hear are people crying out for a savior."") Barrrrrf!Okay, now that we've dissected the innards, let's get into what's good.Director Byran Singer does his best with this tough script and pulls the film up by its sagging bootstraps. The visuals are absolutely stunning. The outerspace shots (from the opening credits) are, to use my son's expression, ""Wicked!"" This makes it a must see on the big screen.The costumes. Loved the fact that Superman's outfit is a bit darker. The cape isn't blood red anymore but is purplish. The ""S"" on his chest is also darker, indicating Superman has faults. He's a shadowy man now. He has jealousies (towards Lois Lane's fiancee) and feels out of touch with humanity.I mentioned a bit of homage going on and Mr. Singer puts some of it to good use. Most notably a kind of tribute to the late, great Chris Reeves, whom many of us movie-goers consider the ultimate Superguy. The smug super-smiles (especially at the end of the flick), some similar dialogue (""Statistically speaking, flying is still the safest way to travel""), and the emotional weight hefted upon Superman by all the women who faun over him are all there and done exceptionally well. Many may feel a closeness with Mr. Singer's approach for including these items in the film. I know I did.So there you have it, a mixed bag. Not great but not horrible either.

(despite being recast entirely) the tone is consistent with the Donner films, being both silly and self deprecating. while at the same time telling a deeply human story. the focus is on spectacle (of an often ridiculous nature) instead of action or combat.So my conclusion,if watched by itself...

1023316,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B000J10EQU,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[0, 0]","Giving you a brief rundown of where I stand, I thought the 1st ""Superman"" was ok. I actually enjoyed Part 2 better; part 3 was my favorite; and even though part 4 got a lot of harsh criticism, I didn't think it was so bad. I kind of liked it.Onto the subject at hand. I understand that this movie was an uphill battle at best and a doomed failure at worst. I understand that most people already had the irrevocable image of Christopher Reeve as Superman. But this already difficult battle was not handled well.For one thing, this movie tries to be consistent with Part 1 and 2. (It shows images of Marlon Brando from Part 1, and having Lex Luthor know about Superman's base from Part 2.) BUT, this movie seems to forget that the death of Superman's 'earth' mother was mentioned in Part 3, and that Superman made arrangements to sell the family farm in Part 4.The main problem here is that the movie does NOT remain consistent with the 1st 4; NOR DOES IT MAKE A CLEAN BREAK AND START FRESH. (Making a clean break and starting fresh was probably the best bet for this difficult uphill battle.)Moving on, it almost gets annoying when it at least seems that Rooth is imitating Christopher Reeve. He may have been better off just bringing his own style to the role. Something like this happened recently.After 2 Harry Potter movies, Richard Harris (who did Dumbledore) died. He was beloved in this final role. Now when Sir Michael Gambon took the role from part 3, he was smart enough not to imitate Richard Harris. He knew this was a difficult spot. So he just did Dumbledore with his own style. (Probably Sir Michael Gambon's smartest move under the circumstances.)Well, back to Superman. His jealousy over Lois Lane having moved on with her life seems a bit unfair. (He did after all leave for some years.) Lois Lane did the healthy thing. She moved on with her life. (She also has a son now.)What saves this movie from being a complete and utter disaster is Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor. He has gotten out of jail and now has the family fortune to start new with. He is very bad. But like many of Charles Dickens's villains, he carries a charm that makes him likable in a way. His big plan is to use Kryptonic elements to create a new world, and take over.There is an interesting climactic moment where Lex Luthor leads Superman into a trap, and it's hard not to enjoy seeing Lex Luthor finally get his chance to punch out Superman.Another character worth mentioning is Frank Langella as Mr. White. In his minor (but still significant) role, he adds a bit of charm. Lois is starting to feel bad about her book: ""Why the World Does Not Need Superman."" And with some charm, Frank Langella says: ""Don't worry Lois. People won't remember what you got the Pulitzer Prize for. They will just remember that you got it.""Believe me, I TRIED to be open to this film. I TRIED to give it a fair chance. I TRIED to understand that Brandon Routh had a very difficult if not impossible task. But it just didn't work. I give the movie 1 star for Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, and 1 star for Frank Langella. Another annoying element is that if the movie takes place some years after Part 2, why do the characters look younger than they did in Part 2?SUMMED UP: They had a choice. They could have either remained consistent with the 4 Christopher Reeve movies, or they could have made a clean break and started fresh. AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY DID NEITHER.Being perfectly honest, if you have not seen the 4 Christopher Reeve movies, you may be more able to accept this and enjoy it on its own.

Or a recape? And a reboot - with that new costume. Or a rape? But even worse, Big Bird's half a remake. And every stolen take is half-baked. The copycakes.It got embaressing when they start to duplicate a scene, and you think well at least they don't do that completely - and then they do later, like with the music.Oh yeh, and the music not by John Williams stands out like a - another person! It falls flat like Supe without his powers. Why didn't they at least get him? Who shot JW? And then when William's music comes in again it sticks out like a soar-ing man!It makes me sore they can't find an original script writer.At a million a minute, it amazed me what they film.Doing a sequal 25 years later is bad enough and doesn't work, but make it half the same makes less sense!25 years later the new Bluebird has to be as better as the first was then to what was before. But one can achieve only one's goal.I usually hate costume dramas, but usually love this one with one, but the whole film becomes a piece of cape, to boot. In fact, more: it's a cape caper to two boots. But that is entirely inconsequal, like half the film.____________________________________________________________________________________________________________2 MAJOR FLAWSAnd yes, it's insane to have Lex Luther AGAIN. (Imagine if the Batman movies only had the joker.)But more insane is his scheme - in the wrong way. And it all amounts to a huge piece Kraptonite. And as bland as big.I return to The Bird with the Primary Plumage's absence for it must have affected his judgement. In the jet save (yes, not the bat cave), he ignored the most urgent situation to keep on with a finished task. Bizarre. That was doubly odd because he didn't need to do that for the plot, as normally happens.Yet to mention the horrendous injuries the people would have from G-forces all the way in that jet scene, even just the bit viewed in the preview.To say again what I haven't said: This film needs to be remade. Now! Or at least unmade.____________________________________________________________________________________________________________TO REPEAT...There were a few fleeting times when Supe-baby was magic - such as in silent unexpected flight. But not only does the film seem the hotch potch result of all the past troubles, doubts, and revisions in getting it done, but mainly amounts to consistant pale, weak reminders of the first successful film where they did the work - properly! And if you think it's annoying how often I'm repeating that, you get the picture of the film.To reiterate, I regurgitate again what I repeated before on this floor____________________________________________________________________________________________________________SMALLBITSVILLEOne small note. I'd like to know where Superman got the plastic for his insigna. Was it part of the spaceship, or did he get it from a plastics shop? I like it though.And, did S have brown eyes in the beginning, but in every other scene his eyes are blue?And why is his cape and boots mauve? Mauve (n): A moderate grayish violet to moderate reddish purple.Finally, firstly, I want to see a SuperMAN like the comics - with the build of Mr UNIVERSE.THEN he'd look right, instead of annorexic or mere mortal.God knows what the sequal to this one will be - a remake of this one?

1023318,ABM71MMZAD3DP,B000J10EQU,Branko Vekic,"[2, 7]","(SPOILERS!!!) Imagine a guy, lying comatose in a hospital bed, patterned pyamas and all, being visited by the son he doesn't know he has... one of the rare things differing this movie from the Mexican soaps is the absence of Spanish language (I know a lot of people likes this genre, but it doesn't have anything to do with Superman). It was trumpeted for it's faithfulness to Richard Donner's movie, but, in the light of this situation, any refference to it and a quotation feels more like sacriledgeous blow than a nod. Mr. Donner knew and felt what Superman IS all about, and what we get here instead is pathetic soap, interspersed with overblown action scenes. To discuss the fact that any logic is surgically operated out of this movie (eg, Superman stops the plane from crashing in the last moment, becouse of it's weight, and then, afterwards, hurtles the whole mountain consisting partly of KRYPTONITE into space, almost effortlessly) would be beside the point. The music, when it is not any of majestic John William's themes, is simply put awfull, especially contrasted to aforementioned themes, which are very well performed, orchestrated, recorded, and engineered this time, making the situation enven more painful. Well, Bryan Singer never had good music in his movies anyway, but he had good movies so far, so he could get away with that. Also, the logic of casting a cute, but ultimately charisma-and-character-less actress in the role of Lois Lane will forever elude me. Saying all this, I have to point out that I respect Mr. Singer and his work very much, and congratulate him for discovering Brandon Routh (if only he had restrained his emoting a bit, it would not look that he is going to throw up one too many times - otherwise he was great as Superman).

Indeed, the theme music is the same; Brando's footage and voice as Superman's father are repurposed; this movie clearly acknowledges that the first Superman movie happened and is meant to be placed in the same universe.  Brandon Routh does a credible Christopher Reeve; Kevin Spacey maintains the same tone as Hackman did in the original; and indeed the tone of the picture is very much that of the original ""Superman.""So why three stars?  First, there just isn't much of a story in this movie.  The first one wasn't a masterpiece of storytelling, but it had plot aplenty compared to this.  Second, ""Superman Returns"" lacks the iconic moments of the first movie that you remember even years after seeing the film.  Third, this movie isn't so much about Superman as it is about Lois Lane.  My wife pointed this out, and she's right.  Not that Lois Lane isn't an interesting or worthwhile character, but we want to see a movie about Superman when we are watching ""Superman Returns.""

The film itself was well casted, some were better than previous ones i thought. Kevin Spacey i thought played a more serious and ruthless lex luthor than Gene Hackman did. Kate Bosworth herself played a better lois lane who seemed more serious at her job and smarter aswell as beautiful. Frank Langella played a good perry white as Jason Marsden played his nephew. though Marc Mcclure i liked better, Sam Huntington did a decent job. Now for the things i didnt much like in this installment. I didnt care much for the new superman costume design. If this film is to take place after the first two christopher reeve films, why change the design? the colors and material didnt bother me that much, but i thought it would be better if they stuck with the previous design, having the bigger chest S symbol aswell as the yellow S symbol on the cape. Keeping the cape little shorter and not change the belt buckle or boots. i asked numberous of people what they thought and they agreed to keep the color and material but not use the new design. I mean come on, no-one in their right mind is gonna think of superman being a real person. Bryan Singer did a good job though on this movie still as he did with the first two x-men films,theplot was decent for a larger scale plan thats been already done. superman having a kid i thought wasnt too bad, would make sense after what he and lois did in superman 2. but overall i give this a five star sense it earned its place in the franchise. thats all i gotta comment. and id like to think i speak for everyone, but we miss you Christopher Reeve as the world needs and still wants a real-life superman. god bless ya and your wife.",5,The Man Of Steel Is Back!,1165276800,"12 5, 2006",2006,1798,"['first', 'i', 'was', 'doubtful', 'newcomer', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'being', 'superman', 'i', 'must', 'say', 'proved', 'worthy', 'put', 'cape', 'film', 'was', 'well', 'casted', 'were', 'better', 'previous', 'ones', 'i', 'thought', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'i', 'thought', 'played', 'more', 'serious', 'ruthless', 'lex', 'luthor', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'did', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'played', 'better', 'lois', 'lane', 'who', 'seemed', 'more', 'serious', 'job', 'smarter', 'aswell', 'beautiful', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'played', 'good', 'perry', 'white', 'Jason', 'Marsden', 'played', 'nephew', 'Marc', 'Mcclure', 'i', 'liked', 'better', 'Sam', 'Huntington', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'Now', 'things', 'i', 'didnt', 'much', 'installment', 'didnt', 'care', 'much', 'new', 'superman', 'costume', 'design', 'film', 'take', 'place', 'first', 'two', 'christopher', 'reeve', 'films', 'why', 'change', 'design', 'colors', 'material', 'didnt', 'much', 'i', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'stuck', 'previous', 'design', 'having', 'bigger', 'chest', 'S', 'symbol', 'aswell', 'yellow', 'S', 'symbol', 'cape', 'Keeping', 'cape', 'little', 'shorter', 'not', 'change', 'belt', 'buckle', 'boots', 'i', 'asked', 'numberous', 'people', 'what', 'thought', 'agreed', 'keep', 'color', 'material', 'not', 'use', 'new', 'design', 'mean', 'come', 'no-one', 'right', 'mind', 'gon', 'think', 'superman', 'being', 'real', 'person', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'movie', 'still', 'did', 'first', 'two', 'x-men', 'films', 'theplot', 'was', 'decent', 'larger', 'scale', 'plan', 'been', 'already', 'done', 'superman', 'having', 'kid', 'i', 'thought', 'wasnt', 'too', 'bad', 'would', 'make', 'sense', 'what', 'lois', 'did', 'superman', '2.', 'overall', 'i', 'give', 'five', 'star', 'sense', 'earned', 'place', 'franchise', 'i', 'got', 'ta', 'comment', 'id', 'think', 'i', 'speak', 'everyone', 'miss', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'world', 'still', 'real-life', 'superman', 'god', 'bless', 'ya', 'wife']",N/A

That film represented my first real exposure to that legendary DC Comics superhero. It, along with Richard Lester's equally memorable ""Superman II,"" has forever shaped my worldview of what Superman, the actual character, is all about.And then along came Bryan Singer, the one man brave enough to breathe new life into the Man of Steel after films III and IV very nearly destroyed his cinematic aura forever. A great many of us appear to harbor the impression that Mr. Singer had dropped the ball in a rather obtuse manner when he decided to helm this feature over ""X-Men 3.""Clearly, I must digress.Having experienced ""Superman Returns"" once in the theater, I can now say in all honesty that I will never again listen to cynics or couch-critics. This was an affectionate and extremely well-crafted two and a half hour diversion from reality. We all seem to feel obligated to compare new films such as this to the older releases that inspired them. Why can't we just enjoy a film like this on its own merits? It isn't entirely outside the realm of reason, especially when you take into account that it's only a movie we're talking about in the first place. I saw quite a bit of the late Christopher Reeve within Brandon Routh's portrayal, and the casting of Kevin Spacey was nothing short of brilliant. His Lex Luthor, for me, was just as memorable as Gene Hackman's. I have to be honest and admit that watching this film was tantamount to reliving the one part of my childhood that I never really abandoned. That would more accurately entail my sense of enthrallment, the pure and innocent wonder I felt as a boy while watching Superman save the day.I really tend to believe that most of those people who, for whatever reason, did not enjoy this film are picking it apart for all the wrong reasons. Nothing Bryan Singer brings to this movie is any less difficult to accept than the plot structure employed by Donner or Lester.

The story of Superman's return to Earth, why he was gone for so long, as well as the twist at the end of the movie, were all well done. I also like that this movie didn't go the obvious route of yet another version of the love story between Superman and Lois. There was so much more to this movie that their relationship barely factored into it. Lois had moved on to someone else and was still completely oblivious to the fact that Clark is Superman.

If you can, watch the extended versions of each one. (The extended version of Superman 1 includes Kirk Alyn and Noel Neill playing little Lois Lane's parents. Kirk and Noel played Superman and Lois Lane in the 1940's Superman Serial.)In the second Reeve Superman movie, Superman voluntarily gave up his powers, temporarily, and while powerless, had sex with Lois Lane. Then after gaining his powers back, he hypnotized Lois into forgetting the entire incident.In Superman Returns, Kal-El returns to Earth after spending five years journeying in a rocket to Krypton space and back, looking to see if anyone survived. (The fact that he found an intact piece of Argo City implies we might see a Supergirl Movie someday.)Superman Returns to discover that Lois has a son. During the length of this movie, he learns more and more about little Jason, and obviously realizes that Jason must be his son. He doesn't see, but we do see Jason surprising himself with sudden bursts of superpowers, like pushing the piano over onto the thug that was threatening his mother.Unfortunately, the novelization of Superman Returns leaves out the details about Jason's superpowers. I had so hoped to see more about Jason's powers in the book.So, if the matter of Jason's powers didn't make sense to you, be sure to go back and watch Superman 1 and 2. I also enjoyed the fact that the producers put details in, to honor the memory of Chris Reeve, like letting Superman remind us of scenes from the CR movies. When Superman told the people on the plane that he hoped the experience didn't put them off flying, and how flying was still the safest form of travel (not an exact quote), he was, in my mind, telling Lois, ""Yes, I remember the first time we met, it had to do with flying.""I hope you enjoyed this movie as much as I did, and I hope you go back and watch the earlier movies.

1023329,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B000J10EQU,Caleb Williams,"[8, 14]","I have to say first, I'm not a comic book fan. I've never read, nor will I ever read any sort of comic book. I am, however, a movie fan. I loved the first two Chris Reeve Superman Movies, (3 and 4 were just dreadful) and I was hoping that with this reincarnation it would bring back the awesomeness of the first two. It seems that with Superman Returns for whatever reason it decided to become a sequel, but not a proper sequel, just a sequel where they change things that happened in the past which we know didn't happen because we watched the first four movies. (The last two, yes unfortunately)I'm going to touch on quite a few things that I noticed in this movie where I raised one eyebrow and thought, WTF? The first one is the main one that I think most people will have noticed and genuinely asked the question. What were they thinking? OK, Superman had left Metropolis to find the remains of his home planet which had apparently been discovered by astronomers. This was something that had happened after Superman 4, and now he returns to jump back into the job he abandoned and make friends with the bitter Lois Lane. This is what annoyed me. Lois Lane, for whatever reason had suddenly forgotten that Clark Kent was Superman? Forgive me if I'm wrong here but didn't she find out his real identity in the first Superman Movie? I know this film wasn't billed as an actual sequel, but if you're going to name a movie Superman Returns, and it's released 28 years after the original Superman movie then you have to at least keep it consistent because you have a lot of people at least expecting a bit of a sequel feel to it.The other thing I wanted to poke at was something another reviewer has also mentioned. This is a comic book movie, correct? This is a movie based on a man from another planet who's pretty much invincible, correct? Then why is it that with this sequel they had the beauty of CGI and the ability to bring a crazy villain (rather than Luthor) to go against Superman. Why don't we get some real comic book action in this film? Spiderman did it, The Incredible Hulk has done it, hell even the Dark Knight has done it. So why did Superman not bother? Why did Singer, Harris & Dougherty decide to give us a soap operatic movie that simply, Superman fans weren't after. Sure the Lois reunion would have been cool and to see her moved on would have been interesting, but this was the whole damn movie. Superman returns to Earth to find that a bitter Lois had written a Pulitzer prize winning article on ""Why the Earth doesn't need Superman."" Lois has moved on and she's now in a new relationship with the unlikeable Richard played by James Marsden and has a child to him. Sure a new relationship storyline is fun and all but this consumed the entire movie and the Lex Luthor's insane plot was overshadowed by that.That's not the icing on the cake, you're going to love this ridiculousness. The kid, while on a boat being kidnapped by Luthor, along with Lois by the way. Lois is being approached by one of the henchmen who's ready to beat the crap out of her, then BAM!!! out of nowhere a piano flies into the face of the henchman. So the child is the child of Superman, remember Lois can't remember who Superman really is, she's forgotten. Nothings confirmed though, you see it could have been just one of those crazy feats of strength that you hear people have on the news.I've got nothing else to say, apart from this is THE worst superhero movie EVER. I know that may be a bit of an exaggeration, but I can assure you I'm not. This is even worse than the Batman & Robin movie from 1997 because at least that had more fighting and action. In Superman Returns we were presented with about three major action scenes and they were literally no longer than 5 minutes. Brandon Routh can make a good Superman and Spacey a good Luthor. Bosworth needs to be dropped as she's just terrible as Lois Lane. I'm only hoping that in the sequel entitled Man of Steel (the DC movies are creating a theme with comic book movies now, just look at The Dark Knight, sequel to Batman Begins) the cast have another bout of amnesia and the child and the poor relationship are forgotten about and we can be given a real comic book movie from the new Superman.

Is it fair to compare them? Of course, because growing up with Christopher Reeve as ""the"" only superman makes me an expert skeptic, and with all the remakes and rip offs out there now, if you choose to make one you must be open to comparison. Superman is a seminal character in comic book, pop culture and movie history, essentially an alien story he has become the ultimate earth champion. I was afraid that making a new superman movie would pull him out of his gentleman old fashioned movie star ways, and recast him as some idiotic CGI modern superstar. Thank God they got it right!From the opening scene, with Brando's voice I just knew they were going to honor what came before. Brandon Routh is eerily similar to Reeves, both in looks and mannerisms. I am not sure how much of that is planned, or if Routh just carries himself the same way. Kevin Spacey as Lex is also like looking at Gene Hackman they both can carry off the ""sneering, comical criminal mastermind"", and look darn good bald. In the original movies I personally couldn't stand Margot Kidder as Lois Lane. Kidder never embodied Lane the way the comics fleshed her out to be, a strong reporter headstrong woman but feminine and just a bit nave, She was to abrasive and manly and quite frankly not all that attractive. So I hoped they would cast a better Lois, and that is the only thing they failed in. Kate Bosworth? Who's range of acting roles at this point have been to play surfers and horse lovers and Sandra Dee (who she also messed up). She is really a blonde, and the wig they used for her was awful, too high on her forehead. She is also too skinny and angular and just has one face for every single emotion. Routh deserved a better Lois just as Reeves did. As for the character of Kitty, played by the marvelous genius Parker Posey (who should have been Lane instead) she almost stole that movie altogether.As for the content of this movie, the plot, it was acceptable.

I never cared for the ditzy Lois Lane of Margot Kidder, so Kate Bosworth's moody one is more effective and sexier (at least for me).

First of all, you would think Warner Brothers would learn from the reinvention of the Batman franchise they nearly killed. I always thought the target audience should be adults, and then would eventually make it down to kids. This kind of campy storytelling will not be tolerated by the public at large anymore.Secondly, I felt there was some sentimental value attached to this film due to the passing of Christopher and Dana Reeve to not allow a more objective critique of the film. I'm not coming down on Brandon Routh at all. I think he did a wonderful job taking the Superman mantle. Aside from a few poor casting choices (Bossworth and Posey). The cast carries out very good performances. Not surprising was Kevin Spacey's marvelous performance as Lex Luthor. While clearly differing from Hackman's performance. Spacey offers a more jubulent take which adds more depth to the character.And third, what made this film lose its cohesiveness was the direction of the story. Bryan Singer did a great job of re introducing the characters. But after that failed to take the movie in a clear direction. So in truth, you only need to see the first half of the film. After the second half you might end up scratching your head.A shout to the people at Warner Brothers. You boys clearly don't have a clue wether you have a good thing or a bad thing so I'll make this real simple. Either hire a competent writer to tell a good story or sell the rights to make these movies. Superman is a good character with a wealth of material in the mythos to use.

The disappointment was that huge.The acting was atrocious and all over the map. The set design was grand but seemed more like the landscapes of Terry Gilliam's Brazil, rather than the Richard Donner feel of the first two installments in the series.There were plot inconsistencies all over the place and things that just didn't make any sense (example: where did Superman get the spaceship to travel back to earth from if his home planet had been destroyed years ago? Also, why is Superman in such agony when he returns to earth since the film makes it clear that he is always enjoying some R and R in outer space before returning to earth).There was zero spark between Clark and Lois this time around, which compared to Reeve and Kidder, shows just how much the filmmakers missed the mark.And Superman would never have that much trouble stopping a plane from crashing. I mean look at the ease he caught the falling helicopter in the first film. He's Superman, not Bruce Wayne or Peter Paker (actual humans).

He certainly had the look and after watching it, he nailed Christopher Reeve's performance well enough, but he brought nothing else other than cribbing/paying homage to Reeve.The Lois Lane actress was absolutely awful.  Even the Smallville Lois Lane actress got the role right in comparison.  Spacey was great as Lex Luthor: a sophisticated, diabolical genius.  Classic Lex and not nearly as campy as Gene Hackman was.Now to the point of my title: Superman spent the entire movie stalking Lois Lane.  He did not feel majestic, or inspiring, but yet creepy and a tad perverted.  By the end of the movie it becomes obvious, to some extent, why he was stalking Lois, but just because they had a love child does not mean it makes it right.  Supes could have just done an X-Ray vision check and discovered the boy shared similar DNA, but instead Superman just stalks Lois.  Heck, to top it off  Superman is a dead-beat-dad!  What, leaving for 5 years and only coming back because his check of Krypton went poorly, and then discovering he bailed on Lois when she was with child.  Another case of: check that Lois isn't pregnant after their rendezvous by using X-Ray vision on her.  All these facts aside, I also imagined that Superman would have married Lois if he was going to become intimate with her, but no, true to popular cultures view of men, he bails after he has his fun.  He sure is swell!  This point and Kevin Spacey are the two things I remember most strongly about this film and thus ruined the experience for me (Spacey's performance being the only true saving grace).  My point is that this is not Superman by any means.  A womanizer, a dead-beat-dad, and a stalker aren't Superman!  Why doesn't anyone see this?  I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!There were other problems with the film as well, but I could care less.  I am thankful they canned this part of the Superman mythos and are starting again (although I have severe reservations on this as well).In the end this movie is incredibly forgetable and disappointing.  As others have said in other reviews, this was just a homage to the Christopher Reeve Superman's and really just tried to capture the feel of the originals, but failed.  If there hadn't been the Dark Knight Trilogy I would suggest that Warner Bros give up on creating super hero films and just leave it to Marvel to do it right.",2,How do you spell Superman?

While the film is visually stunning (and for that, it's certainly at least worth a rental), it lacks a lot in plot and follow through.QUICK SYNOPSIS: Superman returns after having been gone for 5 years(once again, crashing into his mother's farm fields in a meteorite, only this time he's a full grown man instead of a baby). The world has moved on without him. Even the love of his life, Lois Lane, has moved on with someone else. However, it is soon obvious to Superman that the world is in desperate need of a hero, especially after the power hungry lunatic Lex Luther is released from prison and takes up his old ""world domination"" driven ways.I had many issues with this film, even though I desperately wanted to love it. SPOILER ALERT:One of my main concerns was with one of the major plotlines of the story, and that was the relationship between Superman and Lois Lane. The director of ""Superman Returns"" explained that he didn't want to diminish anything that the past Superman films have accomplished. He wanted the memory of the past films to be alive and well, so he decided to tell a return story. Superman left...and then came back. However, if that was the case...how come Lois Lane has no idea that Superman is really Clark Kent? Lois was well aware of this fact in the past films...so why not in this one? She has a child with Superman, how can she not know that the man in glasses she sees everyday at work, and treats with a casual indifference, is the father of her child?There was also a lot to be desired in the Lex Luthor plotline. He is supposed to be a supervillian, but the ending of this film is a little lame and disappointing. I was also disappointed that Superman never actually fights anyone! He's Superman, for goodness sake, can't he throw a punch at *someone*! A bad guy, perhaps?And finally, (and this is a very *minor* thing, but me being the animal lover I am, it was very disturbing), there is a small scene in the movie in which Lex Luthor returns home after a long journey to discover that one of his Chihuahuas (which he inherited from a rich old lady on her death bed) has eaten the other Chihuahua. It lay on the floor and chewed on a rib bone amid a pile of dog fur. It was a disturbing visual on so many levels, and it immediately turned me off of the movie. I realize that it was meant to illustrate what a cold-hearted villian Lex Luthor is, but I just don't feel it was necessary.Having said all that, I still think the movie is worth seeing at least once. There are a lot of cool action sequences, and setting and cinematography are incredible. Kate Bosworth was a bit of a poor fit for Lois Lane. Her character came off as a super-bitch to Superman. The rest of the cast were well suited to their characters.If you want to see any kind of cool special features, then you'll need to purchase the 2 disc special edition of this film. The single disc edition has NO special features on it at all. Just the film and a scene selection option.All in all, it's worth a rental at least. I'd rent it first to see if you like it before you decide to purchase it.",3,Entertaining...but also a Little Disappointing,1164585600,"11 27, 2006",2006,3168,"['Superman', 'returned', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'here', 'save', 'day', 'film', 'visually', 'stunning', 'certainly', 'least', 'rental', 'lot', 'plot', 'follow', 'through.QUICK', 'SYNOPSIS', 'Superman', 'having', 'been', 'gone', '5', 'years', 'once', 'again', 'crashing', 'mother', 'farm', 'fields', 'meteorite', 'only', 'time', 'full', 'grown', 'man', 'instead', 'baby', 'world', 'moved', 'Even', 'love', 'life', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'moved', 'someone', 'else', 'However', 'soon', 'obvious', 'Superman', 'world', 'desperate', 'need', 'hero', 'especially', 'power', 'hungry', 'lunatic', 'Lex', 'Luther', 'released', 'prison', 'up', 'old', 'world', 'domination', 'driven', 'had', 'many', 'issues', 'film', 'even', 'desperately', 'wanted', 'love', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'One', 'main', 'concerns', 'was', 'one', 'major', 'plotlines', 'story', 'was', 'relationship', 'Superman', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'director', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'explained', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'diminish', 'anything', 'past', 'Superman', 'films', 'have', 'accomplished', 'wanted', 'memory', 'past', 'films', 'be', 'alive', 'well', 'decided', 'tell', 'return', 'story', 'Superman', 'left', 'then', 'came', 'back', 'However', 'was', 'case', 'how', 'come', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'idea', 'Superman', 'really', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Lois', 'was', 'well', 'aware', 'fact', 'past', 'films', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'one', 'child', 'Superman', 'how', 'can', 'not', 'know', 'man', 'glasses', 'everyday', 'work', 'treats', 'casual', 'indifference', 'father', 'child', 'was', 'also', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'plotline', 'supposed', 'be', 'supervillian', 'ending', 'film', 'little', 'lame', 'disappointing', 'was', 'also', 'disappointed', 'Superman', 'never', 'actually', 'anyone', 'Superman', 'goodness', 'sake', 'ca', ""n't"", 'throw', 'punch', '*someone*', 'bad', 'guy', 'perhaps', 'finally', 'very', '*minor*', 'thing', 'being', 'animal', 'lover', 'am', 'was', 'very', 'disturbing', 'small', 'scene', 'movie', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'home', 'long', 'journey', 'discover', 'one', 'Chihuahuas', 'inherited', 'rich', 'old', 'lady', 'death', 'bed', 'eaten', 'other', 'Chihuahua', 'lay', 'floor', 'chewed', 'rib', 'bone', 'pile', 'dog', 'fur', 'was', 'disturbing', 'visual', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'immediately', 'turned', 'movie', 'realize', 'was', 'meant', 'illustrate', 'what', 'cold-hearted', 'villian', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'necessary.Having', 'said', 'still', 'think', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'least', 'once', 'are', 'lot', 'cool', 'action', 'sequences', 'setting', 'cinematography', 'are', 'incredible', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'was', 'bit', 'poor', 'fit', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'character', 'came', 'off', 'super-bitch', 'Superman', 'rest', 'cast', 'were', 'well', 'suited', 'characters.If', 'want', 'see', 'kind', 'cool', 'special', 'features', 'then', ""'ll"", 'need', 'purchase', '2', 'disc', 'special', 'edition', 'film', 'single', 'disc', 'edition', 'NO', 'special', 'features', 'Just', 'film', 'scene', 'selection', 'option.All', 'rental', 'least', ""'d"", 'rent', 'first', 'see', 'like', 'decide', 'purchase']",N/A

The ""hook"" of this film is very appealing: Superman has been gone for nearly five years, and has to remind the woman he loves, and the world, that he still matters.This is a daunting task that weighs heavily upon our hero.  With almost every frame, we are reminded of how ironic Superman's existence is: the world loves him, looks up to him, yet he is totally disconnected from it.Now here's what I didn't like.  This film pretty much sticks to the same formula as the 1978 film.  Lex Luthor, Superman's arch enemy, is just a wealthy thug.  In the more modern comic, he actually becomes president of the United States.  He's still evil, but he manages to fool the masses into thinking that he's good.  The Lex of the present- day comic book is smarter, more manipulative, and less comical than the Lex of yesteryear.  Lex's ""respectability"" and greater aptitude for deception makes him a more formidable opponent in today's Superman Comic.This could have been an interesting scenario for this series, but seems unlikely given the ending of this film.But we'll see...EXCUSE ME WHILE I RANTCountless people keep comparing Routh to Reeve, Spacey to Hackman, etc.  This is  absurd! The first Reeve film is now 18 years old!  People should respect the fact that this is a very different vision for a different generation.

Hm, kinda like some synchronicities it seem. And yep, got eyed by a real pretty american chick as well along the way...Now, before I talk about the whole IMAX thing, first about the movie itself: not to put a level of high expectation, I was ready to say that it's a good rendition of revamping the SUPERMAN mythos, and the IMAX effects gave it a spectacular touch -- but eventually with the SUPES plotline having been rebuffed quite one too many times now to the point of overkill mainly with the romantic innuendo's done about between LOIS LANE and CLARK KENT, one can't help but cite a lot of predictability going on with the storyline's twist and turns, and thus its not a-web swingin'.And also along the lines with this- the ghost from the SALKIND production movie series have haunted this one at the most, which not only have the score of John Williams from the previous movies re-used within the movie itself (in spite that its musical score provided by John Ottman are on level as some splendid successor to soar in this Superman flick) - it also used segments of Marlon Brando from the first SALKIND production flick (which featured SUPERTRAMP's song ""Give A Little Bit"" playing on the car of Lois Lane at one scene) wherein he plays Supes' dad Jor-El, and a lot of plot elements from the previous films as well, that thus makes the movie a sequel that's not really necessarily a sequel of sorts to the SALKIND Superman flicks, and it also includes a plotline that had a lot to deal with the second installment from those movies, the sequel SUPERMAN II - which in the result cracks a very big whole in its plot - being that Supes is taken away of his Superbeing (ie. Powers) when he cracked the arse of Lois Lane at that time (you'd get the idea about this matter once you've seen the flick, no pun intended) - which in that respect only characterizes the kind of a typical american fictionary stuff, whenever.AS FOR the IMAX treatment = it actually only go for four scenes within the flick, being that the movie is not really intendedly made for an IMAX movie fare, they've only enhanced selected parts of the flick for the 3D enhanced segment portions.That to speak of, the whole innovation from the traditional 3D effect that IMAX came up with is nothing new - 'twas innovated at first with the View Master toyline of disc reels implemented by the company called GAF back in the late 60's and the 70's -- and then tis made possible with movies, by the likes of JAWS 3D, wherein glasses for the 3D movie don't have to be consistedly required of a half red lense while the other lense's green, but a grey one that gives a sturdy condition for the 3D moving pictures' quality in comprising the 3D movie as a whole.But being that the company who came up with the 3Dimentional movie effect is a small one, they gladly sold the rights as incorporated upon syndication to IMAX - who added the touch of an 8-story screen, plus surround sound enhancements, and now they bill it with bigger packaging if not the budget for selling it to the masses. However, the trailers shown for those that are made by the IMAX movie group are quite pretty neat - they are impressive. Most impressively the one titled TYRANOUSSOROUS REX -- ooh, i'd like ta give her a grab a-hold.Anyhow, for the cast and crew: director Bryan Singer did the story for the flick, along with Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris, who both did the screenplay. This time executively produced by a certain Chris Lee among others - it featured Frank Langella as Perry White (who coincidentally just lately starred on the flick called 10.5 APOCALYPSE that was featured on the boob tube, with the shape of America in its storyline turned much too peculiarly similar with the way Lex Luthor in this flick (which is here portrayed by Kevin Spacey, who did a na-bad performance of the character/arch-nemesis of Supes, next to his predecessor Gene Hackman) envisioned it to become), and a host of others that are none-too notable at all.Another glitch in the storyline that makes this movie hard to squeeze in as a real part of the previous Superman flicks, is that Clark's mom Martha is still living, when she's reportedly already gone dead in SUPERMAN 3!And in closing as for the guy who played the red-caped crime fighter this time, Brandon Routh- nyeah, he may have the affiliation to cut himself as a real ticket for being the next dip hearthrob, but in this flick he is more often unnatural to fit the bill of the main Supes-character, that with computer jitz-effects paving the way to enhance him itself - it's all so well forced. It looks so artificial so much so with the flying effects, that it depended not to use strings that much for the effects' sequences but on inanely boring computer fx which only makes it lose its magic even more.I say, given under that projection, might as well watch the classic Supes cartoon of Max & David Fleischer, who's series about are conveniently now available on video or DVD.For the role of the superduper caped crusader, nobody else tops the bill quite obviously as in the case of Robert Powell playing the role of Christ on Franco Zeffirelli's JESUS OF NAZARETH flick - that for this case no ones fits perfectly to play Superman but no other than the late actor himself, Mr. Christopher Reeve.crutchead's ratings =IMAX enhancements: 7 out of 10Movie: 2 1/2 out of 5 notchessound effects: 3. 10 on the Richter scaleoverall rating: 6 burritoes + one onionmusic's not bad, though really.THIS IS review #123 btw, for these here your friendly online convenient store AMAZON.Com, -- oops!

1023349,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B000J10EQU,Chris Kennison,"[0, 4]","Okay, I'm a pretty jaded person when it comes to movies. There is a lot of junk out there. More than ever before. Tired of the same ol' same ol. Tired of the excessive ratio of 5-to-1 horror movies shot by your neighbor on the video shelves. Tired of talentless people getting GOLDEN opportunities to star in films and less then average screenplays getting green lit.That being said... I'm not NEAR as jaded as some of these SUPERMAN geeks who are whining about the costume (ENOUGH ALREADY). They've read so many comic books so many times that they can't bare to see ANYTHING altered.That being said. SUPERMAN turns out being what going to the movies is all about. An adventure. Escapism. If you're going into this movie LOOKING for things to complain about, I feel sorry for you. ME, I found myself wrapped up in a film more than I've been in a long time. I felt the dread. I felt the emotional moments. I laughed and I cried (well... I didn't cry, but I welled up once... I'm a new Dad... give me a break).Superman has it all. Most importantly, Bryan Singer (the director), did what a lot of these superhero films are forgetting to do (i.e. see fantastic 4... er, don't), that is, get the audience EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED.SUPERMAN's opening sequence sets the stage wonderfully. As his ship crash lands once again in the Kent family farm in Smallville, Kansas, you wonder briefly if we're looking back in time, rehashing, and then his earthbound mother finds him in the wreckage, cradles him and says, ""Clark. My son.""Many things have changed. Most noteably, Lois Lane is now married with son. Lex Luther is free from prison and SUPERMAN wastes no time realizing that the world was missing him.I won't give away things, because SUPERMAN has surprises. But, I will say that KEVIN SPACEY brings Lex Luther to life. He is phenominal, kooky, funny, insane and dangerous. You feel the dread. You feel the danger in the plan he is concocting.

1023351,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000J10EQU,Chris Pandolfi,"[8, 10]","I'm incredibly torn over how I feel about Bryan Singer's ""Superman Returns."" On the one hand, it has enough heart to render anyone within a five-mile radius deeply moved. It's not just a meaningless gathering of action, mayhem, and special effects; it actually goes deeper by presenting a story filled with complexity and emotion, all in the face of stylized danger. I'm afraid I can't describe that aspect any further because doing so would give away some really important plot points. Let's just say that Superman's return enables a wealth of repressed feelings to resurface, some of which have been kept secret for a long time. This alone is enough for a recommendation.However, I had some major problems with the film as a whole, and that brings me to the other hand. As classic and well loved as Superman is, this new story doesn't do much to enhance his reputation. Nor does it make it worse; what it does do is prevent him from transcending his well-established image. It's so well established that he practically vanishes behind a gigantic cliche. As I watched ""Superman Returns,"" I came to the realization that he's really not that interesting a character anymore. We live in an age when heroes like Spider-Man, Batman, and the X-Men rake in the big bucks at the box office. True, they were all created in comic book stories many, many years ago. But through the talents of screenwriters and directors, they've been able to stay fresh, energetic, and edgy on the big screen. Superman, however, is exactly the same as he was when he started out back in the late 1930s. Even today, he can dodge bullets and lift heavy objects. He still has x-ray vision, and he can still shoot lasers from his eyes and blow frost onto a fire. And he still believes in truth, justice, and the American Way.I suppose now you can see why I'm so torn over this film. I loved its humanity but was disappointed by its lack of originality. I was also disappointed by Superman's overall look. Replacing Christopher Reeve is Brandon Routh, a young man whose role called for him to be dressed in a rubberized suit and for his hair to be overly slick and shiny. I thought he looked more like a plastic Ken doll than a real person. Looking so fake and pristine doesn't exactly add to his credibility as a character. However, it does help that his physique and facial expressions bear a striking resemblance to Reeve's. Somehow, I found that it gave the entire project legitimacy; Routh recaptures a wonderful performance as established in Richard Donner's original 1978 film.One of the best things about that film was the opening sequence. It showed the credits flying towards the camera amid shots of outer space, all the while playing John William's triumphant main theme. ""Superman Returns"" opens in much the same way, and it includes William's theme (interwoven throughout the film with John Ottman's original score). But this time, the credits move so quickly that you barely have time to notice any of the names. Luckily, few people care about reading names at the beginning of a movie; all they're really interested in is getting lost in the story, which in this case is incredibly interesting. Superman returns to Earth after an intergalactic journey to the remains of Krypton, his former home planet. Apparently, pieces of it had recently been discovered, and it forced him to wonder whether or not the planet was, in fact, completely destroyed. Of course, we all remember the destruction scene from the first movie (if you don't, this new movie takes a couple of seconds to remind you).After reuniting with his widowed mother, Martha (Eva Marie Saint, whose character is barely developed), he returns to Metropolis as the clumsy Clark Kent and gets his old job back at the Daily Planet. All the important characters are still there. First, there's Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington), the good-natured but undeniably geeky photographer. Then there's the head honcho, Perry White (Frank Langella), a man that's always ready for the next big scoop. Finally, there's Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), the headstrong reporter. Upon his return, Clark is surprised to learn that Lois has since gotten involved in a relationship and has had a child. He also learns that she had written an article entitled ""Why the World Doesn't Need Superman"" (which, interestingly, earned her a Pulitzer Prize). He realizes then that his untimely disappearance turned her bitter and resentful. She even seems to behave strangely towards the Clark Kent alter ego, never really interested in giving him the time of day despite not seeing him in many years. (Why no one could see the coincidence there is beyond me; I think it's gotten to the point where not realizing Clark Kent and Superman are one and the same is implausible.)Superman first reappears in public after he prevents a jet plane from crash landing. It was a plane that just happened to have Lois as a passenger (covering a story, no less). This heroic stunt is the first of many encounters that forces her to reassess her feelings. Yes, she does love her boyfriend, Richard (James Marsden), and rightfully so; he's a good-natured, friendly man, and he cares deeply for Lois and their son, Jason (Tristan Lake Leabu). But Superman was always the one she truly loved, and that brings on a multitude of conflicting emotions. It gets even more intense when she begins to notice the way Superman and her son have formed a subtle yet significant connection.Of course, no ""Superman"" story would be complete without the inclusion of Lex Luthor, the evil criminal mastermind whose hatred of the flying goody-two-shoes is only surpassed by his lust for world domination. Taking the reigns from Gene Hackman is Kevin Spacey, who gives Luthor a diabolical edge that served the film well. This is not just in terms of the story; it's also in terms of the genre. Only a comic book villain could think up grandiose schemes that could never be accomplished in real life. Most of the time, they involve large gadgets, unheard of technologies, and the proposed death of millions.Luthor adheres strictly to that mindset, always being able to conjure up delightfully over the top ideas. In the original film he attempted to sink the entire California coast by launching a missile into the San Andreas Fault. Now he intends to literally create his own continent in the middle of the ocean, a feat that can only be accomplished with special crystals. Specifically, he needs the self-generating crystals that make up the structure of Superman's Fortress of Solitude. Naturally, he has the power and resources to collect everything he needs. The most unnecessary resource was his Pomeranian-loving female companion, Kitty (Parker Posey). Her semi ditzy behavior is not at all compatible to his sophisticated demeanor, and I just couldn't believe he actually wanted to be around her.His careful scheming sets into motion the comic book side of the story, the side that doesn't focus on complexity or meaning so much as it focuses on special effects and entertainment. It would be hypocritical of me to say that I didn't have fun watching those scenes. Let's face it; eye candy is great in a comic book adventure film. But they didn't enliven the experience for me, either. If anything, I felt like I was watching an undeveloped idea, one that never really took off because it was bogged down by unoriginal qualities (such as the fact that ""Metropolis"" is really Manhattan). But as I said before, the humanity it presents is so touching that it outweighs all the other flaws. It's that aspect of ""Superman Returns"" I want everyone to see, the one that delves into genuine emotion without getting overly sappy. So am I recommending this movie? Yeah, I guess I am, but just barely (if I could, I'd give it three and a half stars). It's a recommendation made in the hope that the emotional experience will be enough to satisfy you. If it isn't, then don't say I didn't warn you.",4,"Up, Up, and Away",1151452800,"06 28, 2006",2006,7964,"[""'m"", 'incredibly', 'torn', 'how', 'feel', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'one',

I sort of ignored that aspect of the character although it was expressed in the Christopher Reeve films.  I was never crazy about the character as a hero but I realize now that it sucks to be Kal-El.  His world is irreversibly gone.  The new story is also a bad one for the hero.  This movie is much better than I expected.  I didn't like the casting from photographs but in moving pictures, both Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth look and express themselves beautifully.  It also helps to cast overqualified character actors Kevin Spacey and Parker Posey.  And Brandon Routh can pull off the same thing that Christopher Reeve did - be beautiful by gazing kindly i.e. evoke being beautiful from within despite whatever either one of them looks like.  Well done!  Someone else trying to do that would most likely look manipulative or drippy.  I absolutely loved how I felt assured listening to Brandon Routh use Jor El's words at the end of the movie.  It sucks to lose your entire world and way of life because of evil.

And so of course, Superman has to contend with not only Luthor but a woman who doesn't love him anymore and a responsibility that he abandoned.It's slightly eerie at how Superman's career has always been in direct competition or level as DC Comics' other hero, Batman. They both had an excellent first film, a pretty good second film with the next 2 being absolute duds, the worst being the 4th. Superman Returns is like the Batman Begins of the series, only it doesn't restart the series so much as it puts it back on track. Ignoring part III and IV, the film is essentially the ""real"" Superman III, taking place after II. Is this better than the first one? Relatively speaking I like it better but only by a bit. Newcomer Brandon Routh, while looking a bit too similar to Christopher Reeve, is perfect as bumbling nervous Clark and hero of the Earth, Superman. I never liked Gene Hackman's wisecracking portrayal of Luthor and Spacey manages to have that menace he needed while also providing some humor.(Some of it unintentional: ""wrong!"") While the rest of the cast is fine, the one misfire is Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane. She doesn't give a bad performance really, it's just Lois is supposed to be a feisty gal born out of woman's liberation movement while she plays it as a soft-spoken damsel in distress at times.Well it's a Superman movie so do we get to see superhero stuff? Naturally. Probably the best action scene of the year, Superman has to save a maiden voyage of an airplane attached to a space shuttle has they careen towards space and Earth. It's exciting, energetic and just plain awesome. The rest of the stuff he does is not as ambitious but it's certainly no less cool, bringing out the geek in us that loves to see guys lift up 10 tonne globes. The one thing though is that the effects at times look slightly obvious. The flying though has never been better(except for a really bad digital double shot at the end), with the cape finally have some wind in it, unlike 1978's cape where it just flopped down his legs. Shot on the Genesis HD camera, the film looked sharp in theatre and most likely will on next-gen players but on DVD they look slightly too obvious or grainy. Is the film too long? At times, but it gives the film much needed character moments without being a teenybopper superhero movie for the masses(such as Fantastic Four).Batman Begins to me at times didn't feel exciting, as if it looked exciting but it didn't keep me enthralled. Superman Returns did, only the length and ANOTHER Luthor land mass scheme made it knock down a point or 2 but this is another one on the list for best comic book hero films, and it's about time too.",4,A welcome return for the Man of Steel,1164672000,"11 28, 2006",2006,3799,"['Even', 'review', 'might', 'say', 'otherwise', 'original', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'film', 'was', 'merely', 'good', 'superhero', 'movie', 'one', 'better', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'However', 'were', 'just', 'things', 'were', 'merely', 'uninteresting', 'slightly', 'long', 'just', 'unnecessary', 'Part', 'II', 'was', 'actually', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'less', 'said', 'III', 'IV', 'everyone', 'benefit', 'Stuck', 'development', 'hell', 'better', 'part', 'decade', 'film', 'finally', 'got', 'lifted', 'off', 'ground', 'when', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'director', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'first', '2', 'X-Men', 'films', 'came', 'onboard', 'Thankfully', 'ideas', 'Doomsday', 'riding', 'mechanical', 'spider', 'have', 'been', 'exorcised', 'have', 'solid', 'entry', 'series', 'will', 'probably', 'disappoint', 'some.It', 'been', '5', 'years', 'Superman', 'disappeared', 'searching', 'remains', 'home', 'planet', 'Krypton', 'Returning', 'world', 'still', 'trouble', 'moreso', 'love', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'moved', 'evidence', 'Pulitzer', 'winning', 'article', 'Why', 'World', 'Does', ""n't"", 'Need', 'Superman', 'Not', 'only', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'jail', 'got', 'mind', 'land', 'deal', 'course', 'entire', 'United', 'States', 'risk', 'so', 'course', 'Superman', 'contend', 'not', 'only', 'Luthor', 'woman', 'who', ""n't"", 'love', 'anymore', 'responsibility', 'slightly', 'how', 'Superman', 'career', 'always', 'been', 'direct', 'competition', 'level', 'DC', 'Comics', 'other', 'hero', 'Batman', 'had', 'excellent', 'first', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'second', 'film', 'next', '2', 'being', 'absolute', 'duds', 'worst', 'being', '4th', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'series', 'only', ""n't"", 'restart', 'series', 'so', 'much', 'back', 'track', 'Ignoring', 'part', 'III', 'IV', 'film', 'essentially', 'real', 'Superman', 'III', 'taking', 'place', 'II', 'better', 'first', 'one', 'Relatively', 'speaking', 'better', 'only', 'bit', 'Newcomer', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'looking', 'bit', 'too', 'similar', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'perfect', 'bumbling', 'nervous', 'Clark', 'hero', 'Earth', 'Superman', 'never', 'liked', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'wisecracking', 'portrayal', 'Luthor', 'Spacey', 'manages', 'have', 'menace', 'needed', 'while', 'also', 'providing', 'humor', 'unintentional', 'wrong', 'rest', 'cast', 'fine', 'one', 'misfire', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'Lois', 'Lane', ""n't"", 'give', 'bad', 'performance', 'really', 'just', 'Lois', 'supposed', 'be', 'feisty', 'gal', 'born', 'woman', 'liberation', 'movement', 'soft-spoken', 'damsel', 'distress', 'times.Well', 'Superman', 'movie', 'so', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'superhero', 'stuff', 'Naturally', 'Probably', 'best', 'action', 'scene', 'year', 'Superman', 'save', 'maiden', 'voyage', 'airplane', 'attached', 'space', 'shuttle', 'careen', 'towards', 'space', 'Earth', 'exciting', 'energetic', 'just', 'plain', 'awesome', 'rest', 'stuff', 'not', 'ambitious', 'certainly', 'no', 'less', 'cool', 'bringing', 'out', 'geek', 'see', 'guys', 'lift', 'up', '10', 'tonne', 'globes', 'one', 'thing', 'though', 'effects', 'times', 'look', 'slightly', 'obvious', 'flying', 'though', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'really', 'bad', 'digital', 'double', 'shot', 'end', 'cape', 'finally', 'have', 'wind', '1978', 'cape', 'where', 'just', 'flopped', 'down', 'legs', 'Shot', 'Genesis', 'HD', 'camera', 'film', 'looked', 'sharp', 'theatre', 'most', 'likely', 'will', 'next-gen', 'players', 'DVD', 'look', 'slightly', 'too', 'obvious', 'grainy', 'film', 'too', 'long', 'times', 'film', 'much', 'needed', 'character', 'moments', 'being', 'teenybopper', 'superhero', 'movie', 'masses', 'such', 'Fantastic', 'Four', '.Batman', 'times', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'exciting', 'looked', 'exciting', 'did', ""n't"", 'keep', 'enthralled', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'did', 'only', 'length', 'ANOTHER', 'Luthor', 'land', 'mass', 'scheme', 'made', 'knock', 'down', 'point', '2', 'one', 'list', 'best', 'comic', 'book', 'hero', 'films', 'time', 'too']",N/A
1023356,A3JNICYJRSVGA9,B000J10EQU,Comic Online,"[6, 9]","Let's start with the positives:1.) Brandon Routh does a good Chrisopher Reeve impersonation.2.) Kevin Spacey & Parker Posey were pretty good as Luther and Kitty.  I think they captured much of what Hackman and that chick had in the original Reeve movies.3.) The retention of John Williams' Superman theme.4.) Luther's yacht was pretty cool.5.) Luther was bald. I was always disappointed that Hackman wasn't (except at the very end).6.) It was widescreen.7.) It was in color.Ok, i'm grasping at straws now.Now on to the negatives:1.) Brandon Routh was too young to play Superman ...especially a Superman that's supposed to be 5 years older than Reeve in Superman 2.  He looks like he's in transition from SuperBOY to SuperMAN.2.) Kate Bosworth was TOTALLY miscast as Lois.  She was waaaay too young.  She didn't have the right look either.  She had NO personality.  She was boring to watch, and brought nothing compelling to the character.3.) The story. Do i really need to tread this again?  It was tired.  Although it technically hadn't been done already, it sure felt like it had. Lex luther trying to take over the world...AGAIN. In fact, isn't it kinda the same as Superman: The Movie? How about bringing in some of Superman's famous super-villians from the comic books?  In 50 years of live-action Superman offerings, that has almost NEVER been done.  And we have the effects technology to do it very well.  Hey, how about doing an adaptation of the HUGELY successful comic ""The Death of Superman?""4.) In addition to this feeling like a re-tread of an old story, i thought the special effects kind of got in the way. To some degree, the effects almost had another-worldly aspect to them, and i felt as though i was in some far-off land, as opposed to a big American city.  Someone compared this to Terry Gilliam's Brazil.  Some of the imagery i found a bit pretentious, as well.  It seems like the filmakers really enjoyed showcasing the effects, without working on the story enough.  When they did break from the effects to talk about plot, i didn't care, as the writing was dull, and subplots were uninteresting.5.) Plot holes...for one, if this kid can hurl a piano across a room, why can't he punch out two henchmen?  And frankly, i'm sick of this notion that because Superman loses his super powers, he suddenly becomes a total wimp, who can be taken down by street toughs and old truckers in diners (Superman II).  I mean he IS afterall still a muscular 30 year-old with years of fighting experience behind him.  Uggghh.6.) Ned Beatty.  Luther needed a dumb hechman like Otis.I wish Bryan Singer (the director) had finished the X-Men trilogy and directed the last film. His first 2 were great.  Yet he threw it all away to do this. And now because of his decision, TWO movies have suffered.  I'm sure i'll get reamed for writing this, but how about Spielberg?  He offered to direct the Star Wars prequels, but Lucas turned him down.  Think of how much better THOSE would have been with Spielberg at the helm.  Lucas makes FANTASTIC epic pictures when he lets someone else direct (Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, all 3 Indiana Jones films).  Not that Lucas was involved with Superman, but...well, anyway.  I would love to hear other people's suggestions for who would have done a better job with this movie.All that having been said, was it worth seeing?  Of course it was.  Any Superman is worth seeing, especially in the theater.  To be able to see that red cape flapping in the breeze, and John Williams' theme music is worth the price of admission...particularly in the theater.  But to OWN?  Go rent it.  It's worth a rental.

In fact, Superman Returns is plagued with bad acting and bad character development. Even the music is old. We've seen and heard everything before. Kate Bosworth makes a dreadful Lois Lane. She neither looks nor acts like a pushy female reporter and was not terribly bright. (Superman and Clark Kent coming back at the same time? Du-uuuuh!)Arguably the best CG in the movie was the scene where Superman saves the plummeting plane from disaster and brings it to rest in the Metropolis Stadium. The scene could have been far more memorable had it been accompanied by great music. Bryan Singer should have recalled the crash landing in the beginning of the last Star Wars movie. That's how a scene like that should be handled.Every modern movie has a chase scene and Superman Returns serves us the same trash that every other action film serves. This time Luthor's girl friend is in a car with no brakes and yet which amazingly remains at 60 mph no matter how many cars and fire hydrants she hits.Superman lowering planes, raising land masses and doing other physically impossible feats works in comics, perhaps, but not in modern movies where audiences are more sophisticated. The movie wastes too much time on contrived action scenes and never develops anyone's character, except possibly Luthor's, and that's primarily because of Kevin Spacey's irrepressible acting ability.Finally, I suspected the true heritage of Lois Lane's son about two seconds after he was introduced. So much for surprises.This film shows why Marvel Comics has the superhero genre wrapped up. Even a bad Marvel film is better than the best DC superhero film, though Batman's return movie was undoubtedly the best of all DC fare.Hopefully, one day the right director will come along and give us a Superman and a Dracula that will knock our socks off. But that day is still a way's off. As for now, both characters must wait for a future ""return"" of merit.

This series needs a spark that Spacey's ""Luthor"" didn't deliver. Add more humor, too. The other films had some laugh- out-loud scenes. Give Olsen and Perry some personality. Jack Larson's ""Olsen"" back on the TV series provided a lot of humor to the show. Get Perry White stirred up. Loosen up Brandon Routh (Superman) and make his character a little more fun, too. This movie would have been so much better with a lot more humor.Kate Bosworth not only is, by far, the prettiest Lois Lane ever, but portrays Lois in a likable fashion. That was nice to see. As for  Routh being the new Superman, I have no complaints. He reminded me a lot of a young Christopher Reeve. I liked the fact that although they played up Superman's feelings toward Lois, they didn't overdo it. They didn't have stupid lines like in 1978 with Superman proving his x-ray vision by telling Lois what color her panties were.

You know, the way the Peter Sellers ""Casino Royale"" isn't really a Bond Film.  Of course, I didn't like Superman III with Reeve and never bothered to see Superman IV.What is good about the film?  Well, it has the comic book silliness.  You know, the space shuttle launching from the back of a 747 because it would get more of a boost from them than two solid rocket boosters, and the familiar engines of the shuttle fire powerfully without any observable place for the fuel.  Almost every scene is full of the same kind of nonsense, but it is this daffy disregard for reality is part and parcel of comic books.  I also liked the fact that Superman more or less levitates in this film rather than ""flying"" like a jet.  Since he has no ""thrusters"", levitating makes more sense.I hated what they did to his outfit.  The cape and boots are too dark and the ""S"" signature on his chest is too small and too high.  However, since they were turning the ""Man of Steel"" into some kind of metrosexual, using the ""S"" as a bodice rather than a shield or breastplate might make some sort of perverse sense.And the inversion of sexual mores is complete in this film with Lois Lane becoming a single mom, the details of which you will have to learn for yourself by seeing the film.  However, if such a plot point had been used in the original superman, well, one would not have required super hearing to notice the instantaneous outcry from the public.My advice is to treat this film the way the middle ""Highlander"" films were treated when they decided to get back to the original.

1023361,A1Z54EM24Y40LL,B000J10EQU,csm,"[5, 7]","Well, here's a little surprise for the ladies out there.  This movie is a great, great romance movie!  Didn't really expect that one but the chemistry that goes on between Superman and Lois is just incredible.  Basically, Superman is getting lonely, especially after finding out there really isn't anything left of Krypton after five years of searching.  That is the focus of this movie and not necessarily the high-action plot that many were looking for in this movie.  Instead, the writers took a closer look at the relationship between our hero and the ever strong Miss Lane and it really, really works.  They're crying together in the end, if that gives you any idea of what to expect - it's just a really strong love story between two soul mates that was acted out just beautifully.Next, I must say that this is probably one of the BEST movies I've ever seen in a long, long time (I've already seen it twice - you really need to because, although it's almost 3 hours long, it flies by pretty fast and there's a bunch of stuff you miss)! There's something for everyone in this film. As I said, it is a  GREAT romance, hands down. But that said, I think the men out there were expecting more of a ""boy movie"" with this film which it does deliver in some respects, but Bryan Singer does spend some time on the relationship between Lois and Superman. Something for the ""girls"" out there! It is extremely well written. As a writer myself, that just amazed me. Brandon Routh is absolutely awesome in the role of Superman and makes everything look so very easy (it's cool watching him fly - he just zips in and out almost completely unnoticed at times). This one is quite emotional and amazing with the tribute to the 911 tragedy in the first rescue scene when Superman appears to save the shuttle/airplane launch. Hearing and seeing the tears in the audience after that one was amazing. It was pretty funny seeing Lois faint afterwards too! Lots of different emotions going on in that scene! Plus, it was shot in Dodger Stadium so that's really awesome!Regarding the children - it is okay I think to take a child (not younger than five though - it gets pretty intense during the action portions plus, it's hard for them to follow) to this one (and I'm VERY picky about that). The PG13 rating is for some raucous language and one shot that could have been easily, easily left out - they have Clark Kent drinking a beer with Jimmie. Not much of a role model for young boys, huh? Other than that, this thing was incredible. Oh, another part in the movie that children might find upsetting is when Lex Luthor is trying to stab Superman with Kryptonite. Had to cover the eyes during that scene. It got pretty hard to take in some places.Otherwise, great, great stuff - a definite improvement over the previous episodes of the 80s. Routh's Superman definitely stands alone and one that just will be horrifically difficult to surpass. You definitely get goosebumps too when that rewritten theme comes on too. Golly! Highly, highly recommend this movie - can't wait to go out and see it again and get the dvd when it comes out as well! And, just for the record, I NEVER see movies twice. It's expensive enough the first time but when they're worth it, they're worth it and this one definitely is in my book. Thanks for a great film and in particular, one that is crafted and written very well.

Stoneham,"[5, 8]","I really would give this movie 3 1/2 stars, but I figure what they hey, round up :)It's simple for me: when Superman was on the screen, it was awesome!  When it was Clark Kent?  Yawn.  The Clark kent scenes didn't have anywhere near the whimsical fun of the older movies.  Routh is a good actor, but he's no Christopher Reeve when it comes to playing the alter ego.  I would have graded the movie much lower if it hadn't been all Superman in the last 30 minutes.I enjoyed the tie-ins to the original movie, including lines spoken by Marlon Brando pulled straight from the first.  There were multiple ""duplicate scenes"" from the original that I enjoyed as well.  I just wish Routh had pulled Clark kent off better...As for Superman...  OH. MY. GOD.  The BEST thing they did was handle how Superman flies.  It was ALWAYS fast.  I mean FAST.  I mean ""Faster than a speeding bullet"" fast. ;)  I LOVED sitting there and feeling like I was being pushed back in my seat whenever we had an over-the-shoulder shot of Supes flying.  Excellent.  And the use of his powers always had what I would expect in a real superhero: routine for them but absolutely awe-inspiring for the common person.  They REALLY did a good job with the FX on this one.  Best Superman yet.So, I guess my title sums up my feelings.  When Superman was on the screen, I couldn't get enough.  When Clark Kent was on the screen, I'd had enough within 30 seconds.  That, and the ""Savior"" imagery was a bit much.

So now I will state the obvious question: Why don't the bigwigs over at Warner Bros. dispense with bringing in overrated big name directors such as Singer and give the reins to guys who know the material inside and out, such as animated series gurus Paul Dini and Bruce Timm?  Pick basically any individual episode of the Superman cartoon; it was better than Superman Returns.  I credit that with the knowledge of the characters.

1023367,A239PPUVV8O0U0,B000J10EQU,D. A. Reed,"[3, 4]","To me, what truly bogs this film down is bad casting, particularly Lois Lane, the pacing and the lack of originality. While Brandon Routh (who is a dead ringer for Christopher Reeve) acts very well for his role, he doesn't seem to command screen presence like Reeve (ironically the first Superman being his first big feature). Kevin Spacey uses more dry humor and has a lethal threat to him when compared to Gene Hackman. My only wish for these Superman films is STOP USING LEX LUTHOR! It's not like he's got plenty of other villains to go up against (Brainiac, Bizarro, Toyman, Silver Banshee, Mongul, Doomsday, etc.) And since they did use Luthor, again, couldn't they've turned him into the twisted business man instead of him just going after land? Again. Frank Langella does a good job with Perry White, even throwing a reference to the old TV series. Sam Huntington is bland as Jimmy Olsen (a character I don't really like anyway, he gets on my nerves too easily). James Marsden's character was a nice twist so that way Lois isn't always pining after Superman, but the guy must not be very confident in Lois' affections towards him as every time the hero's name is mentioned, he gets into some whiney attitude. Eva Marie-Saint, Jack Larson and Noel Neil (Jimmy and Lois, respectively, from the original series) cameo as well. Bosworth was a complete mistake as a Lois. I don't know if its the way they chose to go with the character or not, but she HATES Superman, almost downright dispises him. I know the guy left without saying goodbye and that can feel hurtful but to go on and write an aricle about how the world doesn't need Superman when, before he left anyway, he was always constantly saving her skin, doesn't put her in a good light. And she looks way too young for the role. When I saw Margot Kidder, I didn't see an actor, I saw Lois Lane. The other aspect I hated was the allusion that Jason is Superman's son (alluding to Supes and Lois' one night stand back in Superman II). It seems too contrived and it feels like a forced plot point. The pacing is slow, especially once Luthor's Kryptonite landmass is formed. For an action movie, the third act, which is supposed to be the climax, just feels like an extension of the second act. The effects are good but the heat vision you can just barely see and some shots of Routh flying (I suppose when its actually him) looks like he's CGI. The story feels unoriginal. I know Singer meant it as a tribute to the first two (more so the first) but Superman reiterating the line about airplanes, using Marlon Brando, Luthor's obsession with land and the romantic flying sequence just feel like they were ripping those moments off. Now, subtle references/moments which work better for me are Kitty asking if Luthor's been in the Fortress before, saving a plane and Lois' first interview with Superman. John Ottman does a fine job adapting Williams' classic themes while doing a great job with his own material (and editing the movie as well).",4,At Least It Erased The Bad Taste of 3 (and 4) Away,1257724800,"11 9, 2009",2009,3002,"['what', 'truly', 'film', 'down', 'bad', 'casting', 'particularly', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'pacing', 'lack', 'originality', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'who', 'dead', 'ringer', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'very', 'well', 'role', ""n't"", 'seem', 'command', 'screen', 'presence', 'Reeve', 'ironically', 'first', 'Superman', 'being', 'first', 'big', 'feature', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'more', 'dry', 'humor', 'lethal', 'threat', 'when', 'compared', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'only', 'wish', 'Superman', 'films', 'STOP', 'USING', 'LEX', 'LUTHOR', 'not', 'got', 'plenty', 'other', 'villains', 'go', 'up', 'Brainiac', 'Bizarro', 'Toyman', 'Silver', 'Banshee', 'Mongul', 'Doomsday', 'etc', 'did', 'use', 'Luthor', 'again', 'could', ""n't"", ""'ve"", 'turned', 'twisted', 'business', 'man', 'instead', 'just', 'going', 'land', 'Again', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'good', 'job', 'Perry', 'White', 'even', 'throwing', 'reference', 'old', 'TV', 'series', 'Sam', 'Huntington', 'bland', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'anyway', 'nerves', 'too', 'easily', 'James', 'Marsden', 'character', 'was', 'nice', 'twist', 'way', 'Lois', ""n't"", 'always', 'pining', 'Superman', 'guy', 'must', 'not', 'be', 'very', 'confident', 'Lois', 'affections', 'towards', 'time', 'hero', 'name', 'mentioned', 'whiney', 'attitude', 'Eva', 'Marie-Saint', 'Jack', 'Larson', 'Noel', 'Neil', 'Jimmy', 'Lois', 'respectively', 'original', 'series', 'cameo', 'as', 'well', 'Bosworth', 'was', 'complete', 'mistake', 'Lois', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'way', 'chose', 'go', 'character', 'not', 'HATES', 'Superman', 'almost', 'downright', 'dispises', 'know', 'guy', 'left', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'can', 'feel', 'hurtful', 'go', 'write', 'aricle', 'how', 'world', ""n't"", 'need', 'Superman', 'when', 'left', 'anyway', 'was', 'always', 'constantly', 'saving', 'skin', ""n't"", 'put', 'good', 'light', 'way', 'too', 'young', 'role', 'When', 'saw', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'actor', 'saw', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'other', 'aspect', 'hated', 'was', 'allusion', 'Jason', 'Superman', 'son', 'alluding', 'Supes', 'Lois', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'back', 'Superman', 'II', 'too', 'contrived', 'forced', 'plot', 'point', 'pacing', 'slow', 'especially', 'once', 'Luthor', 'Kryptonite', 'landmass', 'formed', 'action', 'movie', 'third', 'act', 'supposed', 'be', 'climax', 'just', 'feels', 'extension', 'second', 'act', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'heat', 'vision', 'can', 'just', 'barely', 'see', 'shots', 'Routh', 'flying', 'suppose', 'when', 'actually', 'CGI', 'story', 'feels', 'unoriginal', 'know', 'Singer', 'meant', 'tribute', 'first', 'two', 'more', 'so', 'first', 'Superman', 'reiterating', 'line', 'airplanes', 'using', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Luthor', 'obsession', 'land', 'romantic', 'flying', 'sequence', 'just', 'feel', 'were', 'ripping', 'moments', 'off', 'Now', 'subtle', 'references/moments', 'work', 'better', 'are', 'Kitty', 'asking', 'Luthor', 'been', 'Fortress', 'saving', 'plane', 'Lois', 'first', 'interview', 'Superman', 'John', 'Ottman', 'fine', 'job', 'adapting', 'Williams', 'classic', 'themes', 'doing', 'great', 'job', 'own', 'material', 'editing', 'movie', 'as', 'well']",N/A

1023369,A27FR2C67JPDRS,B000J10EQU,Daryl B,"[1, 1]","The Man of Steel has made a welcome return after years absent from the big screen and two dreadful sequels that most superhero fans want to forget.  Bryan Singer, best known for his direction of the box office hits, X-Men 1 & 2, gives the viewers a movie that honors the beloved American icon and wisely ignores the two sequels that pretty much killed off the Superman franchise.The plot begins 5 years after the ending of the second Superman  movie.  Superman, having gone off to find his home world, Krypton and finding nothing, returns to Earth to find Lois moving on with her life, now a mother and a Putlizer prize winner, not to mention the fiancee of Richard White, nephew of Daily Globe editor, Perry White.  While gone, Lex Luthor, Superman's nemesis has been released from prison, bamboozled a rich old lady out of her money and set into action a wicked plan that will doom billions of people.  The storyline places Superman face to face with Luthor as well as placing him as the guardian of Metropolis and the world.Brandon Routh is a perfect selection for Clark Kent/Superman.  With his clean cut good looks and charming smile, he easily fills the red boots vacated by Christopher Reeve, to whom along with his wife, Dana, the movie is dedicated.  There are times when Routh looks uncannily like his predecessor.  He is perfect for the role and I look forward to seeing him in the inevitable sequels.  Kate Bosworth is also good as Lois Lane.  I wasn't impressed with the casting of Ms. Bosworth as Lois when I first heard, but I think she gave a nice performance.  My biggest disappointment, is with the casting that I most looked forward to-----Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor.  I guess I just expected more.  He didn't seem to fully throw himself into the role and Parker Posey as his moll, Kitty, stole all of her scenes with him.  And one other trivial comment---someone give Lois' son, Jason, a haircut, please!  He looks like they pulled him out of a cave, where he was raised by wolves!!The special effects are impressive.  The whole sequence with the airplane is worth the ticket price alone but there are other great action sequences in the film.  The flying effects are so much more advanced from the other films and it really looks so much more convincing.  One of my favorite scenes, which I think is quite romantic, is when Superman first confronts Lois about his disappearance, taking her for a ride above the clouds where he offers a simple but heart-felt apology.  Bryan Singer apparently loves these type of films and puts a lot of heart and effort into them.  I hope that he will direct the sequel before he flies off to another project!This movie has a lot to live up to and must certainly justify its pricey film budget.  While it wasn't as perfect as Spiderman 2, this is a great superhero film and a must see on the silver screen.  I gave the film 5 stars because of Brandon Routh, the special effects and the direction of Bryan Singer.  If I could have, I would have taken a half a star for Spacey's lack luster performance.  Otherwise, this is a near perfect superhero movie.If you are looking for action-packed summer entertainment, this is it.

Kevin Spacey to Gene Hackman, Kevin lacked the personality and flair of Gene, but he was more evil as he and his cohorts kicked Superman when he was down (A brutal image).  Kate to Margot, sorry, no comparison here, Margot was Lois (intelligent, sophisticated yet crass, sexy (and not a mom), assertive that characterized the traits of a real go-getting journalist).  So what we have is the constant comparison of a lesser movie to the pinnacle of all Super Hero movies.  It can't be helped as the Original Superman topped all accounts of previous Supermen, and it appears future Supermen.  Now, how does Superman Returns fare on its own?  We have some rehashing and incorporated bits of the best movie into this one to help it along (Jor-El sequences, etc.).  There are a couple of great action sequences with Superman's actual return, and the Climax, but the rest of the movie is pretty dull.  Characters are not developed, there is little story, and the Man of Steel does a lot of soul searching.  And, when Superman gets ill from Kryptonite poisoning, I was having flashbacks to Superman IV and the Radiation poisoning until miraculous recovery (very similar poisonings).

When Superman returns he finds that Lois Lane is in a long-term relationship, and that she and her not-quite-husband have a son. The film teases us a bit about the paternity of the child, but the ending makes it probable that Superman at least thinks the boy is his, and the long-term-committed partner of Lois obviously owed him a few favours. I would never have believed it all the same - I just didn't think Superman or Clark Kent went in for that sort of thing at all. Another idol shattered I suppose.When I had a few hours to kill waiting for a flight, the obvious and natural thing to do was surely to go and view a film whose opening sequence is a spectacular episode featuring a plane engulfed in fire in mid-air. My own journey seemed the last word in tame predictability after that. In fact I thought that the 777-ablaze was probably the best thing in the movie. It's not a bad effort in general when one has nothing better to do. Spacey is quality, whatever he does, and the rest of the cast acquit themselves quite creditably too. For some reason they have shaved Spacey's head, making him look rather like Patrick Stewart, Brandon Routh as Superman/Kent has obviously been chosen for his resemblance to our lamented Christopher Reeve, but I'm not sure whether anyone really intended Parker Posey in a hat to look quite as much like Ruby Wax as she contrives to do. Lois herself (Kate Bosworth) doesn't have a lot to do except look ornamental, which of course she does very well, and I suppose that this film is more about how it looks than about any acting it might be said to call for. We are rather spoiled these days when it comes to cinematographic effects. They're certainly good in this film, but I'd say only fair-to-middling compared with some others. I'm sure a bit more effort and imagination could have gone into the Krypton/crystal scenes for instance - I almost felt that this civilisation might have died out from the sheer dullness of their environment rather than from supposedly more catastrophic causes.Now that there is a new Superman who looks the part I imagine we can look forward to more in the series.

That seemed all a bit pat. However, it's a very small point that not everyone will agree with. This movie is the best one since the first one with Christopher Reeve. It's excellent entertainment and sets the scene for possible follow-ups.

I would say that it is up there with Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"" and George Lucas's ""Star Wars: Episode 3"".The only flaw that I really noticed from this film was the acting - not that it was bad but I thought that lacked a certian Chistopher Reeve. It's not that Brandon Routh was a ""Bad"" Superman, but I thought that he lacked the heart and overall emotion that Christopher Reeve brought the charactor. I thought that they might have brought in a more experienced actor to play such an important role, but I have to admit that he sure did LOOK like Superman. I think that I am just such a Reeve fan that I would be saying this about anyone who played the part. I just think that it was a hard path for Routh to follow after Reeve had the uniform on for so long. Other than that the acting by everyone else was by far up to par,Kate Bosworth played a very good Lois Lane, Parker Posey was absolutly flawless in playing Kitty and of corse Kevin Spacey as Lex Luther was a perfect fit. Even the smaller roles were very well played. Overall though I do believe that this last installment of the Superman film series does lack the heart that it showed in the first couple of films.Overall the story was just like any Super Hero movie should be, you know how they go. Villian wants to destroy the world, good guy fights bad guy to SAVE the world, good guy wins. So I just told you the VERY short version, the actual version is about two hours and thirty minutes long. Every Minute is worth watching.This very well could be the Biggest Blockbuster film of the summer. You dont want to miss ""Returns"" it is alot of fun to watch on the big screen.P.S This movie, though PG-13 is not rough what so ever and it is most definatly appropriate for Children of about 6 or 7 and above.

Of course!  Superman was absent during 9-11!  This well-done action sequence is a poignant wish that Superman could have helped us on that day.  Where was he when we needed him?Two Jews invented Superman in the 1930's to fight the Nazi menace.  The new Superman is clearly a Christian product.  Superman dies; a Kryptonite blade stabbed into his side helps to finish him off.  He is resurrected to fight- but to fight what?  Perhaps for our souls.  This Superman is no super hero- he is a super savior.  Villain Lex Luthor calls himself Prometheus, the human savior in Greek myth.  So, this film is in the tradition of Godzilla versus King Kong: now, it is Prometheus versus Jesus.I saw the film in IMAX 3-D, and there is much to enjoy to see.  However, the 3-D sequences often look cheesy, and the action grinds on.  There are many fine details to savor, to enjoy, and to discuss, nevertheless.There is terrible news for sophisticated Superman lovers, however.  Superman is resurrected, but Clark Kent is dead.  In Superman II, Superman gave up his powers so that Lois Lane could love him as Clark Kent.  The point was: anyone can love Superman, but who can love Clark Kent?  Superman realized in that great film that his human love could not be, and he accepted his isolated fate.In 'Returns', Superman himself becomes vulnerable.  Lois Lane rescues him, and resurrects him with a kiss.  Superman thus becomes indistinguishable from Neo, the  hero in the Matrix.  Superman loses his true identity- which is as Clark Kent.Clark plays almost no role in this well done, but emotionally routine action flick.  The unique Clark-Supie tension is absent.  Now that Superman is 'vulnerable', and wishes only to be a family man, there is no need for Clark to represent what Superman can never be.The passengers in the jet plane that Superman saved gave him a fascist salute in thanks.  Astounding!  They were correct, however.

The problem is Superman has been reborn multiple times in both Comics and TV shows animated and live action since the decades old Christopher Reeves movies.  Another actor, another director/writer's take on ""what it means to be Superman"" has become a laborious mash up of winks, nods and shout outs to the various eras.Bosworth as Lane is a giant mis-step in casting, almost as bad as Holmes in Batman Begins.  Studios continue to copy each other's most banal and aimless production techniques focusing on big budget, and big name producers/directors hoping for box office return.  Batman Begins proved this approach moderately successful, unfortunately on the artistic side the audience is presented with a polished turd.  The effects look great in Superman returns, the costumes are decent, even Routh as Superman is passable.Sadly, that is where the quality ends.  Kevin Spacey turns in a predictable hammy reincarnation of Gene Hackman's over the top Luthor.  Without a doubt this flamboyant Luthor was trumped in comics and the much loved Superman WB Animated series by a more series and sinister take.  Even the lackluster Smallville had a compelling hard edged, dark and twisted take on the iconic Lex character.Spacey adds nothing to the character we have not seen before, and his performance feels mailed in as the script gives him no highlights, just poorly placed one liners, and cheeky monkey moments with Bosworth.Fans have already had the cheesy, feel good Reeves Superman of the late 70s, early 80s.  Doing almost the exact same thing with modern mainstream actors, a few unknowns, and millions of dollars of special effects produces exactly what you'd expect.  Visually stimulating, mentally draining, forgettable nonsense.There have been many volumes of compelling Superman stories in the recent animated and live action series.

Yes, the Superman of this movie seems less manly than last generation's Superman. But when you figure that by the filming of the next movie he will be older and probably bulkier, the casting seems, surprisingly, almost perfect.Yes, Superman wears his underwear on the outside and looks almost like he's draped with the American flag. But superheroes are loved more by children and most would not want their super hero to look like the average joe. The world in which Superman lives is a simpler one in which good is good, bad is bad, and there isn't much in between. And it seems appropriate that the costumes are simpler also. Superman may not look as intimidating as someone like Wolverine from the Marvel universe but he is probably a better role model for children.And yes, no one is completely sure what makes DC villains tick. It is something along the lines of: they are insane and want to cause as much death and destruction as possible. But the same can be said of many Marvel villains.And sure, Superman is not as easy to relate to as a hero like Spiderman but many fans are content simply to admire and envy the powers of their hero even if they do not relate very much.The major flaw in the movie is the plot. The formula of Lex Luther + green meteoric rock = a suitable antagonist for Superman can never be a foundation for an interesting movie. The plot needs much more tension to create interest. Superman kicking Lex Luther's tail in the end doesn't cause goose pimples any more than someone who squashes an ant with his little finger. What if Superman were to discover that some diabolical cosmic god, refusing to reveal its motivations, was rushing toward Earth to destroy it in his anger?

He finds the world worse off, Lois engaged to Richard White with a son and Lex Luthor loose upon the world because Superman missed a court date.Brandon Routh does an admiral job of trying to fill the red boots, giving a performance reminscent of Christopher Reeve's. The problem is the world has changed since the original Reeve vehicle was released in 1978.  Superman has changed in some formats, for instance Lois and Clark and Smallville.  Routh's version has not changed. He is still the boyscout from the stars.The effects are amazing, and the flight scenes are breath taking.  Kevin Spacey turns in an admirable but not all that original performance as Lex Luthor.Bryan Singer's direction, is as always with him, amazing, concentrating on the people and characters and not the stunts and effects.The problem in the direction lies in the fact Superman does not have a true dark side, even his emotional struggles seem to me to be surface only. Singer needs that darkness to tell his tales properly.  It is sad to say that X3 suffered on account of this.Also the ""surprise"" twist is clear the first time the character around which is revolves is introduced.

1023395,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000J10EQU,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 2]","There's a lot that is supremely well done about this expensive-looking 2006 revival of the long dormant blockbuster franchise, and having the talented Bryan Singer (""X-Men"", ""The Usual Suspects"") helm it was a smart decision since he has proven abilities in creating a singular cinematic vision without compromising the integrity of the story at its core. However, the overriding challenge centers more on the somber, almost reverential tone that Singer has felt a need to imbue the film. That's not to say there are not thrilling moments or even some comic ones, but the most pervasive sense in the epic-length movie is the priority placed in sustaining the mythic stature of Superman and reusing familiar elements from the previous films to ensure we are not disappointed with any possible discontinuity with the legend. I just wish Singer and screenwriters Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris could have looked a little deeper into the irony of a superhero now that we are dealing with a greater sense of ambiguity between good and evil.The film picks up the story about five years after the end of 1980's ""Superman II"" as the superhero returns to Earth after a lengthy sabbatical in which he was futilely trying to find survivors of his home planet Krypton. The world has fallen into inevitable chaos in the interim, but more pertinent, his longtime love Lois Lane has moved on with her life. Still a star reporter at the Daily Planet with a Pulitzer Prize in hand, she now lives with fellow reporter Richard White, the nephew of editor Perry White, and has a young sickly son. Meanwhile, arch-nemesis Lex Luthor, released from prison, embarks on a diabolical plan to create a new continent and destroy North America using the Kryptonian crystals he steals from the Fortress of Solitude. From this elaborate set-up, the plot covers pretty familiar ground for most of the duration, but it is punctuated by some amazing sequences like the young hero's discovery of his powers over gravity in a cornfield, the derring-do rescue of a 737 with Lois aboard, and Superman's misty-eyed airborne seduction of Lois. The story takes an intriguing turn when things look the bleakest for our hero in the last third, but it all ends with the door unsurprisingly wide open for a sequel.Although he has a tendency to look a bit glassy-eyed, Brandon Routh turns out to be an ideal choice for a sincere and somewhat melancholy take on the icon. When he reverts to alter-ego Clark Kent, he seems to be channeling his predecessor Christopher Reeve's bumbling charm, which makes these gratefully brief scenes feel a bit derivative. Given Kevin Spacey's innate tendency toward hamminess, I am surprised that he doesn't seem more inspired by Luthor's utter villainy and satirical sense of cruelty. It's as if the fun has been exhumed out of his performance. Following in Valerie Perrine's footsteps, Parker Posey plays Luthor's moll with air-headed assurance, though the actress' idiosyncratic persona is not fully utilized here. The most problematic casting, however, comes with Kate Bosworth as Lois. Sincere and as committed as she seems to be in the role, she lacks the gravitas and maturity to be remotely convincing as such an accomplished woman. Eva Marie Saint barely has any screen time as Martha Kent, and outtakes of Marlon Brando as Jor-El, Superman's deceased father, are used rather cryptically near the beginning.Not too surprisingly, the film is much more visually lustrous than its inspiration thanks to Newton Thomas Sigel's cinematography, Guy Dyas' production design (especially of Metropolis) and the truly superb special effects. The two-disc 2006 DVD set has the 154-minute movie on the first disc though unfortunately without a commentary track from Singer, the screenwriters or the principals. The second disc offers extras that would be of interest to fanatics, specifically a five-part documentary that lasts nearly three hours and should have been really edited down for the general audience.

Most of them are very valid (even with wildly diverse ratings).  I gave it 3 stars because I was entertained.  I noticed many of the story flaws and raised many of the same questions in my mind that many reviewers noted.  Usually planet sized story/plot holes bug the crap out of me.  But for some reason, I still enjoyed ""Superman Returns"".The one thing that really distracted me as the film went along, was the blatant, obvious rehashing of the story of Christ.  Why this was a point of interest of the film makers I don't know.  I could have done without it.  I'm not against the teachings of Christ (anti-Christ?), but does it really belong in a Superman film?I'm sure many (most) of the people who saw this film noticed the Christ parody. If you're not sure you've noticed them all, here's a list of stuff that I noticed that might help:-Supermans dad, (Jorell/God?) says (I paraphrase) ""Humans are basically good so should be protected (saved)from evil(sin).  So I give them my Son.""-Bitter Lois says the world does not need a savior (Superman).  Superman says he can here everything, the cries for help.  ""Sounds to me like they need a Savior"".-Superman on a couple of occasions says ""I'm everywhere, I'll always be around"".  May the Lord Superman be with you.-Superman gets Lois pregnant without actually doing the deed. (that whole ""spin the world backward to reverse time"" trick in Superman 2}.  A fairly immaculate conception.-Superman sacrifices himself to save the ""good"" humans for the ""sinful bad"" humans.  He died to save humans from human sin (a bit stretchy, but not too much)-Superman is reserected from the dead.  (happy Easter Superman!)-Superman flys to the outer reaches of Earths atmosphere and creates a cross by extending his arms out to the side and pointing his legs straight down.  (Not well disguised BTW).I'm probably missing something, but that's a pretty long list of coincidences.  As much as I enjoyed the movie with it's stupid story/plot holes, great special effect, fun acting and cameos, I really could have done without the Idea that our God(s) are actually Kryptonians and Superman is our savior.  That is enough to lose a star in my rating.  In a nutshell, this film, though not great, is entertaining.  There are some slow spots, and it ends with a fizzle.

1023405,AVQJD41PLPOOQ,B000J10EQU,Eric F.,"[1, 3]","The long-awaited SUPERMAN RETURNS is a good movie, but not a great one.To its credit, I can deeply appreciated keeping the homage to Richard Donner's original 1978 SUPERMAN, with John Williams' score, the soaring opening credits, Marlon Brando footage and Brandon Routh's similarities to the late Christopher Reeve, intact.  Hell, if you look carefully, you can even spot a picture of legendary actor Glenn Ford, who played Jonathon Kent in the original SUPERMAN.  The performances by all involved are more than fair, especially from Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor.Where SUPERMAN RETURNS fails, in my opinion, is the severe lack of action.  Except for the rescue of a jet airliner and bullets violently bouncing off of Superman's chest, the movie is filled with mostly visual wonderment and natural disaster (both of which we had plenty of in the original SUPERMAN).  I should also point out that the outcome of Lex Luthor (he ends up stranded on a deserted island with Parker Posey; who by the way, absolutely ruins the whole movie!  Who told her she could act???) is incredibly stupid.  Sorry for giving that one away.  Tough.So, all in all, Bryan Singer has nothing really new to offer his audience except for brand new actors.If you read up on the history of this project, you'll know that there was a time the studio was considering a script based on the 1992 comic book DEATH OF SUPERMAN.  Action-wise, that would have been much more spectacular!  Perhaps they'll consider it for the sequel.  He can die in that one and be resurrected for the third film.

Unfortunately, ""Superman Returns"" falls short of this IMO. I've seen it 3 times and just can't help feeling that there was wasted potential with virtually every aspect of it, but of course, mainly with the story.I'll echo what many other reviewers have pointed out about the plot-it just feels hollow, contrived and disjointed. I could never get attached to any of the characters enough to really care about what happened to them. I don't blame the actors, I blame the script. There are some scenes that just flat-out bothered me, for example, the lack of true terror on behalf of the airplane passengers after Superman saves them and goes inside the plane to check on them. They just plummeted from the sky in an aircraft and they're only a little shaken up? Come on. Instead of looking like real-life people horrified at having narrowly escaped death, they look like a bunch of actors doing an awful job of pretending to be horrified at having narrowly escaped death, at the command of Bryan Singer. It's poorly executed scenes like this that cause the audience to become ambivalent to what's going on. And why couldn't Superman's son have played a bigger part or have more done with his character? Why was he even in this movie?In terms of performances, I actually think Brandon Routh does a fine job as Clark Kent/Superman. I had no issues with him in the title role, even if he's a little young. Nobody could have filled Christopher Reeve's shoes, so Routh shouldn't be expected to either. To me Kevin Spacey was merely adequate as Lex Luthor. The only issue I have is with Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane. Sorry, just can't buy her in that role. I could easily picture Courtney Cox as Lois...she does have some resemblance to Margot Kidder, and would be a more appropriate age for that role.But on to the good points. The special effects are excellent, even if the CGI isn't realistic-looking in some scenes. The main action sequences are highly entertaining, certainly a lot more thrilling than the previous ""Superman"" films, using the modern-day technology. And just the overall look of the film is impressive. So yeah, I suppose I'm saying that this movie's strongest point is with its visuals.If this were just another summer blockbuster movie I'd probably give it a better review, but this is Superman we're talking about. It could have (and SHOULD have) been a superbly-made spectacle that pays homage to the originals. Instead, it's ""just another action flick."" So for that it gets a 3 from me. I got my money's worth, but failed to walk out of the theater with a revived admiration for the legacy of Superman.And for those of you who own the DVD, here's how to access the Easter Egg on the second disc. Go to Special Features, then go to Deleted Scenes. Put the cursor on ""Features"" at the bottom of the screen and press Down once. A red Superman logo will appear directly underneath ""Features"" and ""Menu.""

1023407,A1E0APHODMK896,B000J10EQU,"Eric Hildebrand ""Flapdoodle""","[2, 7]","I really wanted to like this movie, and, admittedly, there are some good moments.  But seeing as the studio gave Bryan Singer all the money in the world, plenty of time, and quite a bit of creative control and artistic license (I cannot imagine that DC comics was eager to have Superman portrayed as a deadbeat dad!), there should be more than just a few good moments.  Here are the main problems, in no particular order:1) Brandon Routh is not a good Superman.  When he is Clark Kent, he mostly closely resembles Max Fisher from `Rushmore.'  But Max Fisher would have been a better actor.  The worst thing is, and I don't know this was Routh's idea or Singer's, but he does a note-for-note impersonation of Christopher Reeves.  IMO this is just plain ghoulish, considering that the beloved Reeves died just 2 years before this movie.  The various James Bond actors have all played the character with at least slight differences.  Each actor playing Superman has, up to this point, played the character very differently: Kirk Allyn, George Reeves, Christopher Reeve, and Dean Caine each brought a different interpretation of the character.  Why in heaven's name Singer had Routh simply ape Reeves is beyond all comprehension, unless Routh is simply so horrible an actor that he could not be allowed to make the role his own.  On the plus side, Brandon Routh has caused me to give greater respect to Kirk Allyn, and to put George Reeves and Christopher Reeve upon even higher pedestals.2) Kate Bosworth is simply the weakest, blandest, most boring Lois Lane ever.  Not only is there no chemistry with Routh, she has no chemistry with anyone.  She appears simply to have been cast for physical attractiveness and demographic appeal.  But on the upside, she enhances my already great appreciation of Noel Niell, Phyllis Coates, and Margot Kidder.3) Kevin Spacey is usually a good actor, and I guess you could say he gives a good performance here, but ultimately I think he is not quite what Lex Luthor should be.  But maybe if he'd had a decent script.  I don't object to Luthor being played as a closeted gay, Lyle Talbot played Luthor that way in the 1950 movie serial.  But ultimately Spacey is a little camp in the role, even more camp than Gene Hackman in 1978.4) Ultimately, the script is bad.  [SPOILER ALERT:] As much as it must have simply reeked with dramatic temptations, the idea that shortly after bedding Lois, Superman would just fly off into space for 5 years is absurd and offensive.  The real Superman, being raised on Kansas farm, would have too much Midwestern sexual guilt to permit him to just desert Lois for 5 years while she incubates his baby and marries someone else.  This is creepy.  Also, there is a scene in which Superman uses his X-ray vision to spy at Lois, her husband and baby in their home.  I'm sorry, but Superman should not be a Superstalker.5) Speaking of the script, there is a lack of internal logic regarding kryptonite.  [SPOILER ALERT:] Supposedly the kryptonite in Luthor's artificial island makes Superman as weak as drugged kitten.  Yet 15 minutes later, Superman is supposedly able to lift the whole daggum island up and carry it into outer space.6) There is the reuse of Marlon Brando's voice and John Williams' musical score from the 1978 Superman movie.  While these things were good in the original context, in this film they, along with his star's attempt to channel Christopher Reeve serve to create the impression that Bryan Singer really has nothing new to add to the Superman mythos, that he is flailing blindly here, creating sound and fury, but signifying nothing.And that is the thing.  Nothing that is new in this film is any good, and all the good things were already done in various, earlier celluloid incarnations.  And so, the upside is that this DVD has sent me happily back the `Adventures of Superman' TV show.  You are far better off viewing those concise and charming episodes than in owning this pretentious piece of grave robbery.",2,"Ghoulish imitation of the late, great Christopher Reeve...",1199059200,"12 31, 2007",2007,4001,"['really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'admittedly', 'are', 'good', 'moments', 'seeing', 'studio', 'gave', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'money', 'world', 'plenty', 'time', 'quite', 'bit', 'creative', 'control', 'artistic', 'license', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'DC', 'comics', 'was', 'eager', 'have', 'Superman', 'portrayed', 'deadbeat', 'dad', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'just', 'few', 'good', 'moments', 'Here', 'are', 'main', 'problems', 'particular', 'order:1', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'not', 'good', 'Superman', 'When', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'mostly', 'closely', 'Max', 'Fisher', 'Rushmore', 'Max', 'Fisher', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'actor', 'worst', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'Routh', 'idea', 'Singer', 'note-for-note', 'impersonation', 'Christopher', 'Reeves', 'IMO', 'just', 'plain', 'ghoulish', 'considering', 'beloved', 'Reeves', 'died', 'just', '2', 'years', 'movie', 'various', 'James', 'Bond', 'actors', 'have', 'played', 'character', 'least', 'slight', 'differences', 'actor', 'playing', 'Superman', 'up', 'point', 'played', 'character', 'very', 'differently', 'Kirk', 'Allyn', 'George', 'Reeves', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'Dean', 'Caine', 'brought', 'different', 'interpretation', 'character', 'Why', 'heaven', 'name', 'Singer', 'had', 'Routh', 'simply', 'ape', 'Reeves', 'comprehension', 'Routh', 'simply', 'so', 'horrible', 'actor', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'allowed', 'make', 'role', 'own', 'plus', 'side', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'caused', 'give', 'greater', 'respect', 'Kirk', 'Allyn', 'put', 'George', 'Reeves', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'even', 'higher', 'pedestals.2', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'simply', 'weakest', 'blandest', 'most', 'boring', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'ever', 'Not', 'only', 'there', 'chemistry', 'Routh', 'chemistry', 'anyone', 'simply', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'physical', 'attractiveness', 'demographic', 'appeal', 'upside', 'already', 'great', 'appreciation', 'Noel', 'Niell', 'Phyllis', 'Coates', 'Margot', 'Kidder.3', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'usually', 'good', 'actor', 'guess', 'could', 'say', 'good', 'performance', 'here', 'ultimately', 'think', 'not', 'quite', 'what', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'should', 'be', 'maybe', ""'d"", 'had', 'decent', 'script', 'do', ""n't"", 'object', 'Luthor', 'being', 'played', 'closeted', 'gay', 'Lyle', 'Talbot', 'played', 'Luthor', 'way', '1950', 'movie', 'serial', 'ultimately', 'Spacey', 'little', 'camp', 'role', 'even', 'more', 'camp', 'Gene', 'Hackman', '1978.4', 'Ultimately', 'script', 'bad', '[', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', ']', 'As', 'much', 'must', 'have', 'simply', 'reeked', 'dramatic', 'temptations', 'idea', 'shortly', 'bedding', 'Lois', 'Superman', 'would', 'just', 'fly', 'off', 'space', '5', 'years', 'absurd', 'offensive', 'real', 'Superman', 'being', 'raised', 'Kansas', 'farm', 'would', 'have', 'too', 'much', 'Midwestern', 'sexual', 'guilt', 'permit', 'just', 'desert', 'Lois', '5', 'years', 'baby', 'marries', 'someone', 'else', 'creepy', 'Also', 'scene', 'Superman', 'X-ray', 'vision', 'spy', 'Lois', 'husband', 'baby', 'home', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'Superman', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'Superstalker.5', 'Speaking', 'script', 'lack', 'internal', 'logic', 'regarding', 'kryptonite', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', ']', 'Supposedly', 'kryptonite', 'Luthor', 'artificial', 'island', 'Superman', 'as', 'weak', 'drugged', 'kitten', '15', 'minutes', 'later', 'Superman', 'supposedly', 'able', 'lift', 'whole', 'daggum', 'island', 'up', 'carry', 'outer', 'space.6', 'reuse', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'voice', 'John', 'Williams', 'musical', 'score', '1978', 'Superman', 'movie', 'things', 'were', 'good', 'original', 'context', 'film', 'star', 'attempt', 'channel', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'serve', 'create', 'impression', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'really', 'nothing', 'new', 'add', 'Superman', 'mythos', 'flailing', 'blindly', 'here', 'creating', 'sound', 'fury', 'signifying', 'nothing.And', 'thing', 'Nothing', 'new', 'film', 'good', 'good', 'things', 'were', 'already', 'done', 'various', 'earlier', 'celluloid', 'incarnations', 'so', 'upside', 'DVD', 'sent', 'happily', 'back', 'Adventures', 'Superman', 'TV', 'show', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'off', 'viewing', 'concise', 'charming', 'episodes', 'owning', 'pretentious', 'piece', 'grave', 'robbery']",N/A

But Bryan Singer heavily declared that reintroducing The Superman story has always been one of his lifelong dreams. (Just like Peter Jackson did with King Kong.)And his dedication in this film truly shows. Right from the getgo we are introduced to superman's nemesis Lex Luthor who is slowly plotting a plot to destroy superman and have his taste of victory once and for all. Follwoing that, Superman makes his entrance. But It's not your normal entrance. This Superhero's been gone for several years. And leaving Metropolis has taken it's toll on the citizen's. They now have learned to completely forget about superman and move on with there lives.(Just like in real life, audiences were secretly craving another superman movie but slowly moved on and thought that it wouldn't happen.)This time around, Lois lane has adapted her life completely Superman-free. That is, until, you know who starts flying around the town doing good deeds. You begin to realize that Superman is slowly rebuilding his status in Society and returning to what he does best.Replacing Gene hackman is Kevin Spacey, a perfect casting decision of course.Replacing Christopher Reeve is Brandon Routh, a newcomer to the series and this is his debut film.Throughout the filme, you will notice that the special effects have been improved on massively compared to the 1978 version of the classic Superman. But Brandon routh doesn't feel like a simple replacment in my eyes. He looks and sounds just like christopher reeve which only brings more of a joy to the superman legacy of fans. Well done in casting, Bryan Singer.In this movie you'll find Drama, comedy, romance, thrills, chills, and shocks beyond compare.What I really, really, loved about this movie is it's close relationship to the fans and it's Christianized aspect.Not only is superman back and better than ever but the fans are overjoyed by the positive response.

There is no replacing the original.  But, he was probably the best that they could have done.  Lois Lane?  No way.  She was totally unbelievable as a replacement for Margot Kidder.  She was just a totally different character.  That's not saying that she was bad or anything.  But, I just didn't get the connection to the original.  Lex Luthor?  Spot on!!  He made the movie for me.  He was the perfect LL.The idea that Superman has a son with Lois Lane is kind of hard to imagine.  But, it makes the possibilities for a sequel wide open. Ooh! And the son is not affected by kryptonite?  What's a superman with no weakness going to be like?  I guess they'll have to find something else.  I'm sure they will.Then, the other major plot device that I had a problem with was:  ""Why didn't superman just fly so fast that time reversed itself, to solve the problem of the Kryptonite island?""

1023417,A2MRZPTMYFADUV,B000J10EQU,Frodo,"[1, 2]","I actually hadn't planned on seeing this film these holidays. After being bored throughout the ""Spiderman"" movies and disappointed in the latest ""X-men"" I wasn't confident that ""Superman Returns"" could break the ice. But how very wrong I turned out to be. On a spur of the moment, I decided to see it, and it was certainly the highlight of my day.After five long years, Superman, played by newcomer Brandon Routh, returns to Earth. But during his absence, the private life he once knew and led has changed for the worst. His lady love, Lois Lane, played by a brunette Kate Bosworth, appears to have moved on with a job promotion, a new man... and a son. On top of all that, she is an Anti-Superman activist, whose claim to fame was brought on by her negative article that slammed the man of steel's mission to save. As it happens however, old flames never truly die, and as nemisis Lex Lurther attempts to destroy him and all the world, Lois and Superman's poignant love affair survives.To me, ""Superman Returns"" had everything it needed to make it a great superhero film - a great cast, believable chemistry between the two love interests, detestable and comical enemies, a slightly dodgy and predictable script, and, most importantly, fantastic special effects.I thought Brandon Routh's casting as Superman was spot-on. Like Tobey McGuire was to Spiderman, Routh's relitive unknown name meant we had no prejudices going into the film. I think he played Superman's calm, yet alert and deeply engaged character beautifully. Kate Bosworth was charming as the stubborn, yet fragile Lois, and the relationship between the two characters was very touching. Their iconic flight over New York City, I thought, was particularly lovely. I also loved how their love was portrayed only subtely in the physical sense, making their emotional connection that much stronger and believable.Kevin Spacey's portrayal as ravenous Lex Luther was good, if not a little stationary. I think he was the weakest in this film, along with his lady assistant Kitty, played by Parker Posey, who I must admit, just annoyed me! But these flaws did little to supress my enjoyment of the film.The special effects in this film were fabulous, though not quite ""Lord of the Rings."" With the film's somewhat ordinary and predictable script, the special effects were the essential ingredient that ensured the success of this movie. In particular I want to mention the simply exhilerating scene with the aeroplane. I shaln't delve too deeply into details, but it was quite honestly the best part of the film, and had me utterly rivetted! Come Oscar time, I should definately look for ""Superman"" to have gongs in this field.All in all, I entered the cinema expecting an average flick and came out with a grin on my face. With enough action packed in and the right dosage of emotion, ""Superman Retuns"" was a thrill ride adventure that I enjoyed from explosive beginning to heartwarming end.

1023418,A26OGVO2LETH8W,B000J10EQU,Gabe,"[10, 17]","I'm in a minority here, but in my opinion ""Superman Returns"" was a disappointment. The producers should have asked the TV ""Smallville""  writing & acting team to do the movie.While the special effects in ""Superman Returns"" are stunning, the plot is cartoonish and manipulative. It is manipulative in the coy manner (""does he or does he not have super-powers?"") the movie sets up the son of Lois Lane to be Superboy, thereby preparing us for a sequel. It is cartoonish because to have us think that NO ONE sees that Clark Kent is Superman is simply absurd. (1) They look exactly alike, except for Clark's glasses; (2) Both Clark & Superman had been gone for 5 years; (3) Whenever Clark disappears, Superman appears. Come on!!! And to think that Lois, who is so smart she won the Pulitzer, can't see this? What a joke.In having Lois winning a Pulitzer, the movie commits an all too common ""sin"" in contemporary Hollywood movie-making. She looks at most 25 years old, but she has already won a Pulitzer prize!!! In today's movies, women not only are beautiful and accomplished, they are also ""enfant terrible"" geniuses. In so doing, not only is Hollywood divorced from the real world, it is also setting an impossibly high bar for REAL women. Lois also is entirely without personality and charm, which leaves me wondering just exactly why Superman remains smitten with her.I was especially disappointed by Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor. His performance was one-dimensional, shallow, and cartoonish--in the mold of old movie villains who cackle with glee at doing evil. Most unconvincing and tiresome. I can't believe this is the same actor who once won an Oscar for acting.Finally, while Brandon Routh did a respectable job as Kent/Superman, I wonder why both he and the director saw fit to have him mimic Christopher Reeve's rendition of Superman.

The standard definition that Warner Brother's released first, was a jaw-dropping disaster (even as regular dvd goes).  The compression problems, the color reproduction, the banding and aliasing...ugh.  I had been bummed out by this having seen it in IMAX 3D where it looked positivelt luminous.  It was a flagship release for HD DVD, and the problems continued there and with it's first Bluray release in 2006.  The picture and sound were enormously problematic.  WB wisely kept track of the complaints much like Sony did on the first release of The Fifth Element. This release looks and sounds terrific.  It's not perfect, but it's not perfect in a way most people will notice.  There still is evidence of digital noise reduction (DNR), which is a fancy way of saying the picture has been smoothed out to remove compression noise and film grain.  I'm fine with the absence of compression noise, which is a technical flaw, but I love film grain because it is what lets me know it has been sourced from the original print, and it renders detail second to none.  This print still looks gorgeous for the most part.  Color and black levels are generally excellent, albeit muted, which is more to do with Bryan Singer's vision of the film.  X-Men has a similar look.  The horrible technical flaws which were so disappointing in the standard definition DVD version are gone, and this is an exciting, often beautiful print.  Some of the murkier scenes really are more to do with Singer's muted pallette.  The sound has been upgraded as well with Dolby TrueHD and LPCM.  It is an exhilarating and pulverizing soundtrack.  The jetliner rescue is just awesome.  Ambient surrounds, music and dialogue are all supber.  I loved the iconic flight between Supe and Lois.

To a degree it has.Warner Brothers took a major gamble with this film.  Unfortunately, it did not pay off for the studio and especially for the fans since they would have to wait until the Summer 2013 for a new film which may or may not be a hit.Overall, it's a nice production, costumes, sets, and music.  The story attempted to recapture the glory of the first two Superman movies (1978 and 1980).Sadly, the glory faded faster than the red sun of Krypton. Perhaps the most interesting parts of the film were the outtakes.It was a hard sell to see Lois Lane with another guy even if he was Perry White's nephew.  To top it off with a son was a bit too much.  Tristan Lake Leabu, as the young son, was the best cast in this film.Sorry, but Kevin Spacey never fully captured the essence of Lex Luthor.  There were moments, but moments are fleeting glimpses which do not satisfy. I have a high regard for Spacey as an actor.Brandon Roth was too perfect in the role--too pristine, too melancholy.  Of course, this has to do with the director who set the tone.Kate Bosworth's Lois Lane was low-keyed and bitter.  She never captured the fiery spirit of the previous versions of Lois or the suspicious gaze pondering how much Clark and Superman were alike.Special effects were decent.  The scene with the air force plane left much to be desired.  If Superman could pick up a mountain range loaded with kryptonite at the end of the film, he certainly could have handled the plane much better.  It was not a real challenge for Superman.Another villain like Doomsday, Brainiac, Ultraman or Darkseid would have been exciting.  A $209 million budget in 2006 could have made a great film.I give the film three stars because it is a Superman film.  Let's hope the Man of Steel is up to the challenge of propelling the DC Universe into the mainstream which Marvel is dominating.  However, General Zod has had his time in the yellow sun of earth--they could not have come up with a more exciting foe for Superman.

Superman returns to Metropolis after 5 years from Klingon. Clark Kent resumes a job at the Daily Planet. He finds out Louis Lane (Kate Bogsworth) is involved with someone else but he is still in love with her and Louis Lane is still in love with Superman. Then there are some scenes were Superman has to defend the planet and you get to see how much power he has - he can move airplanes, get shot numerous times and have no effect, fly, etc. Then there is a simple plot with Lex Luther (Kevin Spacey).  Interestingly, the movie was 2 and a 1/2 hours long but I felt like I was watching one episode of Superman, not a movie.Kate Bogsworth does not seem like a Louis Lane at all. First, she looks like a girl, not a woman. Second, she has this bad attitude from beginnging to end.  The actors who plays superman/Clark Kent (I read that they were actually two people)do a good job.  Kevin Spacey does fair. There was not much he could do with the script and plot.

But then I discovered the multi-disc boxed set with all four Christopher Reeve movies, director's cuts, a load of extra features, and this movie.  I thought ""what the heck, I'll see how it goes.""  Well, I'm glad I did.  It was a wonderful story, and I thought the sets and special effects were fantastic.  I also loved the warm tones and the art deco that is the Daily Planet.I was familiar with Brandon Routh from his season on ""Chuck,"" although I was not a fan until this movie.  I think his real-life love of Superman really comes out in his acting.  I'm ho-hum on Kate Bosworth's Lois Lane (didn't hate it...didn't love it either) and while I love Frank Langella, I think his Perry White is practically invisible.Kevin Spacey, on the other hand, completely steals the show with his portrayal of Lex Luthor.  He's the perfect comic book villain.  First, I love that he isn't afraid to be bald, unlike Gene Hackman back in the day.  Thank heaven for the ""bald is sexy"" campaign that's been in place for quite some time.  There are two scenes that really stuck with me.  The comical line ""Lois Lane?"" that he sputters while brushing his teeth (it had a certain Scooby-esque quality) and the even more comical physical acting he does a little later where he keeps prompting Lois to say a certain name so he can unleash the hounds at her.  He's so amused at his own cleverness and it's very contagious.*********SPOILER ALERT*********I do agree with others' assessments that Kate Bosworth perhaps wasn't the right person to play Lois Lane.  There really wasn't a lot of chemistry.  On the other hand, given the outcome (the correct outcome, I believe), I recognize there may have been a very good reason for that.

The director and the writers have to set the stage for the characters which have been living in comics for decades. There had never been an XMen movie until Singer directed the first one. There have been four Superman movies before this one.My filmgoing companion loved the film. I was sorely disappointed with Superman Returns. Actors aside, the script is just not enough different from the original Superman film. So what's the point of recreating it? There's all sorts of ""big"" action (he stops a plane from crashing - the best action in the film - and other ""big"" stuff) but it ends up being non action, because it's all just too big and outlandish. And isn't anyone else out there getting more than a little bored with Lex Luthor - a mere mortal, albeit a megalomaniacal one - being the be all, end all nemesis for the Man of Steel? For Pete's sake there are many other villains that they could bring to the forefront. Let's see Superman fight for crying out loud! I'm sick to death of seeing him (on the big screen) stop trains, planes, buildings, signs, etc. It's all too big, too predictable. He can't fight Lex Luthor because Luthor will drop dead with one punch. After all Superman is SUPER! Give Superman someone SUPER to fight! What about Brainiac? What about dozens of other villains he's fought over the years? Geezaloo, are the writers/producers that narrow minded?Now, to the CGI (special effects)...didn't anyone else find Superman's look to be more than a little ""plastic"" looking? I was jarred out of my suspension of disbelief repeatedly by the smooth appearance of Superman's face and tights etc. He looked like a computer generated character rather than a living breathing actor (the handsome but stiff Brandon Routh).All in all, the best Superman storyline and proper updating of Superman has been getting done in the television series ""Smallville"" which has breathed far more life into the character and the stale storylines than Singer's blockbuster budgeted film ever could. In the television series Clark Kent isn't a complete bumbling dolt and as such he is fresh and believable.Unless Superman (read: producers, director, and studio) can come up with some better storylines and fresh villains, I'm afraid any future outings will just be further dull, listless outings. Give me the XMen, Smallville, Spiderman, HellBoy, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and such as my super heros any day over the stiff and repetitive Superman Returns. The super heros in those films are hands on and the action is more ""real"".

Now this is not me wishing it was Reeve playing Superman (or looking to far into things), Singer is the one who said himself that Brandon reminded him the most of Reeve and this is the main reason Routh was cast for the roll, as this movie was to be a sequel to the 1980 movie Superman 2. BIG MISTAKE!The thing with Brandon that killed it for me was his lack of emotion and carisma as Superman (as Roger Ebert states from the Chicago Suntimes). Many say that it was the script and his lines which made him boring in the film, but even in the love scenes with Lois he was missing that connection and emotion for me.With this said, Routh came off as a wanna-be, not nearly as good version of Chris Reeve, but it's not all his fault.This was a huge mistake on Brian Singers part (Director) to cast an actor to play the roll of another actors interpretation of the Superman character. Basically Routh was acting to be Christopher Reeve, not Superman.Spoiler ALERT!Another huge problem for the movie is the fact that Superman leaves for 5 years, comes back to earth, only to find out that he has gotten Lois Pregnant before he left, and then ends up finding out he has a kid!  This goes against everything Superman stands for morally!!!So basically, The son (Superman) becomes a father and the father becomes a dead beat dad who owes 5 years of back child support!Another problem, Superman becomes a stalker!  When he finds out Lois has a boyfriend, he Fly's over to Lois house and uses his X-Ray vision to see through her house and spy on her! WTF!!!!  Creepy indeed!  The character of Superman would NEVER do such a thing, this is bad writing from 2 guys who did not understand the character.Combine all this with lack of action, a bad story, and a wanna-be Chris Reeve, and what do you have...

Admittedly, when the familiar theme song and familiar opening credits to Superman Returns began, my heart fell a little to see the names Christopher Reeves, Margot kidder and Gene Hackman replaced by Brandon Routh, Kate Bosworth and Kevin Spacey.  But it's time to let go.  The torch has been passed.Superman comes back after spending five years in Space looking for remnants of his home planet Krypton.  He returns to Earth after finding nothing and also discovers that life on Earth has gotten along without him.  Lois lane has a five-year-old boy and practically engaged.From this point, the movie jumps right into the plot without explaining too much of Clark Kent's absence and presses forward.  Really no need to do a re-hash of Superman's background.  Bryan Singer takes this story on a more emotional journey that surprisingly both Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth do pretty well.  On top of that, Bryan Singer refines in outstanding special effects what Richard Donner started in  1978.  Expect more graceful, vertical shots of Superman flying as well as beautiful twilight cinematography.  Witness a sonic boom when he shoots up into the air or creating ripples as he darts across the water's surface.As the movie goes along and we've become used to seeing Superman's familiar life-saving strokes, the story becomes more interesting...in fact, very interesting.  I never thought I'd say this, but there is a scene towards the end of the movie that is somewhat of a tearjerker.  Bryan Singer shows his ability to tug at heartstrings as well as put out some great action.  Last time I saw that was X-men 2.Without a doubt, this film was made with a sense of grace and reverence for the world's oldest superhero.

1023434,A21M6XJHHBQSEC,B000J10EQU,G. Kroener,"[8, 23]","Before I even start this review, let me say that I was greatly excited about a new Superman movie, mainly because I've never seen one on the big screen and rumors have been around for years.And what can I say? You won't believe a man can fly.You won't even believe this man is indeed Superman. Why oh why do some many superhero flicks these days have to take itself so freaking serious? Some superhero characters do have the substance to carry a more dark, personal and down- to- earth movie because they were also intended to have some serious conflicts.Bryan Singer and his criminally poor script however burden Superman with problems he was never intended to have.You take away the campyness, the fun, the somewhat emotional distance and the over- the- top characters from Superman, and you carry your film to the grave before it's even out.This isn't Superman, it's some gal's boyfriend who left her for some time and is shocked to find out she doesn't dig him anymore.You put Superman into the 21st century, and you lose another bit of atmosphere. Superman is the epitome of entertainment; you go to the movies to be entertained, not to watch other people having the same problems as you. If I want that, I'll just talk to friends or relatives.All of this renders this film, in a word, pretentious. Even the dumbest audience member can see that Singer stuck Superman in a place he doesn't belong.To bring this pretentiousness to a mindboggling climax, this movie even implies a philosophical subplot of Superman being Prometheus.Seriously, where's the adrenaline, where's the confrontation, where's the fun? And most important: where is the story hiding?It's all incoherent to the extreme.The characters move from place to place without any motivation.About the confrontation: what's the point in having Clark revisit Kansas and Martha when the character doesn't learn anything there (on a side note: why did Superman need a spaceship to get to Krypton? More important, where did he get it? And why did he have to go at all? Doesn't the 1978 movie make it pretty clear to Superman that Krypton is gone?)?What's the point in having James Mardsen as Lois' Joe Everyday when there's no conflict between them?And where's the actual threat for Superman? You would think that after zillions of rejected scripts, they could have come up with something more special than revamping the Methusalem-old ""Luthor gets Kryptonite"" scheme. Even the 1978 original used it as the B- or even C- storyline.The essential difference between Lex Luthor's evil schemes 1978 and 2006 is that the original was tongue in cheek and therefor believable. By making that (essentially same) plan seriously threatening, the writers have rendered the whole movie breathtakingly cringe- worthy.And to top it all off, Lex Luthor's storyline isn't even properly wrapped. This silly ""morooned on an island without gasoline"" is almost too stupid to be true. When Luthor takes off his wig at the end on ""Superman"", at least that was camp and truly humorous. But Supes doesn't even have a final confrontation with him.Then the actors: do they have ANY fun? Clearly not. Brandon Routh is so shockingly stale as Superman, he isn't the charismatic, yet strong hero Christopher Reeve was. Now, one might say this is a new Superman; that point would be valid if this was actually a reboot, but it isn't. It's a sequel.But there's nothing in his character, or any other, that indicates that this is the Superman from 1978.And while watching the film, it seems like Singer didn't know whether he was doing a sequel or a reboot. I believe there are more lines and nods to the first movie than there's original stuff. Couldn't he at least get his continuity right?The audience isn't even given a chance to get familiar with the characters again, simply because their age is wrong. I understand that producers want young, attractive actors for their films, but in this case it means compromising the believability of the storyline. The characters are supposed to be older. Alright, you don't want to do this, at least pick someone who is at the same age, but not 10 years YOUNGER for heaven's sake! Or are we supposed to believe that Superman accidently made earth rotate slower at the end of the original?But the main problem is the peformance. Good god, give at least ONE smile, Routh!Kate Bosworth is in absolutely NO way the character Margot Kidder was, but instead a mother who has to balance job, kid and (pretentious) family turmoils (hooray for another boring and stereotypical modernisation!).Kevin Spacey's Luthor also has not one tiny little shred of his 1978 alter ego. He tries to be serious, but he isn't. He tries to be witty, but he isn't. He tried to deliver one- liners, but he fails. It's all the worse because the movie isn't conscious of its cheesyness, unlike Fantastic Four for instance. Something similar ruinous I have indeed only seen in the Star Wars prequels.And of course the movie is full of CGI. And I don't mean this in the ""action scenes full of CGI"" sense; actually, the lack of real action is pretty refreshing (which would be good, but the acting and no plot makes this action- free time just boring).I mean that CGI is used because it's easier than building and lighting sets/ models. But it doesn't look better. On the contrary, it gives the film a sterile look and feeling that is so typical for this kind of movie nowadays.I've rewatched the original film last night, and the scene in which bullets hit Superman looks so much better than that awful Matrix- like scene in Returns (you know, when in a moment of sheer badness a bullet hits Supes' eye).This is hardly unusual for today's ""Blockbusters"", but it's always worth mentioning.In short, I have never seen a superhero film that resembles its origins less.",2,Why the world doesn't need *this* Superman,1154736000,"08 5, 2006",2006,5806,"['even',

I know that is ""normal"" morality in 2008, but it is still offensive to some of us.Superman always had high ethics, and consideration for Lois, as well as all of humanity - but in this era, he would sleep with her, get her pregnant, and not marry her? What happened to the sense of responsibility and the x-ray-eyes?? I couldn't believe he would not have known before flying off to Krypton.Is that how his foster mom and daddy Jor-El would have raised him?Worse, the 5 y/o boy is sickly, a little diva of asthma medicine, health drinks, and overprotective mothering - though he does once show super strength as he is having an asthma attack! This just seemed ""wrong"". Why wouldn't Superman and an ordinary, healthy woman, have a healthy, half human, stable child? What are the writers trying to tell us?That line ""truth, justice, and the American way"" got changed. It is now ""and all that stuff."" Doesn't he support traditional American values anymore?This also degrades the original Superman. The point is that he embodies all those values we wish we had,in one ""super-man"". He SHOULD be idealized. He should NOT be ""politically correct"" and like average guys with lots of personal faults. HEROES are different.Another twist: his mortality got emphasized. A blade of broken Kryptonite got inside him...The film was very dramatic. Luthor was more cruel than in previous films. I would not let young kids see Superman beaten and bloody, about to die in the ocean. It's not family-friendly OR inspirational to have the hero brutalized this much.We did see the Man of Steel rally to save us from Luthor's plan, at even greater peril to his life, despite the pain of losing Lois to a regular man. Is he feeling suicidal in this movie?I was very uncomfortable with his continued affections towards Lois. It was as if he wanted to lure her away. Like he wanted her to cheat on her husband. This is not how a hero should act. Superman is supposed to be ""above"" regular humanity, remember? Setting a good example, making us admire him.So, a toss-up. I'm glad I didn't buy it, and I was sad to see Superman not be so super anymore.

Quite simply Superman Returns is just about perfect.  It has nearly everything one could want in a 21st Century incarnation for the Man of Steel and the physical production is visually as eye-poppingly glorious as anyone could hope for.  The flying scenes (especially the Superman in space scenes) have a breadth and beauty around them that almost stops one's breath - absolutely stunning.As we've come to expect, there is great humor throughout with winks to the comic books and previous Superman flicks and director Singer doesn't shrink from paying obvious homage to the Reeve flicks - a very nice touch, indeed.  Singer doesn't shrink, either, from going for broke in the second half of the film's more emotional content and the balance between action, love story, and pseudo-religious, philosophical storyline is just about perfect.For all the pre-opening hype criticisms centering around an unknown actor portraying comic's most beloved hero, Brandon Routh proves the naysayers pretty much wrong.  He's got the look, the moves and the feel of the character down.  If his Clark Kent doesn't quite have the presence Reeve brought to the role - (this Clark isn't quite as endearingly bumbling or nerdy) he makes Clark likeable and believable - and makes fully plausible why Lois finds him slightly forgettable.  As The Man of Steel, however, Routh takes the challenge straight on and does not once disappoint his audience.The opening sequences setting up the story have a classic old movie feel, a bit of exposition for history, hilarious snips of Lex Luthor beginning his bid for world domination, Lois and the rest of the world moving on in the years since Superman (and Clark's) leave of absence, all culminating in a breathtaking action sequence wherein our hero saves the lives of those aboard the space shuttle - and ties it all in with America's favorite pastime - Baseball!Kate Bosworth's Lois is a bit bristley (Lois always was) but she always let's the vulnerable quality of her character crack through the tough-as-nails exterior.Kevin Spacey's Lex starts off with a bang, but it isn't until the sequence with Lois aboard his yacht - the turning point of the film - that he gets to fully charm us with his evil craziness.  If up til then I thought Spacey hadn't quite captured the role (as I envisioned anyway), from this point on he OWNED Lex.Parker Posey is an entirely different creature than was Valerie Perrine.  Where Perrine was all curves and opinions, Posey is all angles and dim.  A different spin on the character, but a worthy one.It was terrific to see Eva Marie Saint - now in her 60th year of films, in the small role of Martha Kent.  Even washing dishes or driving her truck, Saint exudes movie star quality that proves the old adage ""there are no small roles.""The movie's more than two and a half hours fly by and everyone - at least at the screening I attended - is left feeling like a kid again.This is probably going to be the hit of the summer and well it should.  It has just about everything one could want in a first ""return"" feature for this superhero and I'm already excited for 2009's sequel!  See it on a big screen.

1023439,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000J10EQU,Grady Harp,"[2, 5]","SUPERMAN RETURNS is actually closer to the original intention of comic books for kids than most of the other incarnations.  Kids bought comic books for the color, the action, the hero who represents the guy who can set a ditzy world straight, and a bunch of feel good sidebars that pay homage to mothers, other kids, bad guys defeated, and the open end for yet another installment.Bryan Singer directs this outing with a degree of simple distinction that holds the piece together.  The story is Superman's return from a five year hiatus in Krypton to bring meaning to the lives of the planet earth.  His mother (Eva Marie Saint) has grown old but still believes in her absentee son, a young hunk Brandon Roth who has little more to do in this film but cast his innocent blue eyes in the direction of evil and be supported by all the CGI props that allow him to fly around the world saving things (Routh may be able to act but he is not given enough lines to let us know this time around).  Lo and behold Lois Lane (a fine Kate Bosworth) is still around but now a mother to the next Superman and living with the nice guy co-editor Richard (the fine James Marsden), the editor being Perry White (Frank Langella).  Once Superman returns to earth he is challenged by the evil Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey embodying evil) with his loopy girlfriend Kitty (the scene stealing, very fine Parker Posey!).The rest of the film is primarily special effects: Lex discovers a crystal form Krypton that can grow into a whole evil world if not checked.  But of course good wins out over evil and it all comes to a slightly teary and funny conclusion.The thing about this version is that it doesn't take itself seriously.  This is an escapist film just as comic books were escapist items for kids.  And it works.

1023440,ACKDSX71VI5HY,B000J10EQU,"Gregory N. Perkins ""wide reader""","[3, 5]","SPOILERS FOLLOWChristopher Reeve casts an immense shadow over the entire ""Superman"" legend.  His well-chronicled brilliance in the role even somewhat bossed parts of this movie into being a pale copy of some lines and scenes from mostly the original Richard Donner ""Superman"" film.  The problem is, I shouldn't begin a review of ""Superman Returns"" by mentioning Christopher Reeve at all.  In short, this movie, directed by Bryan Singer, has a serious identity problem.Here, Brandon Routh steps into the roles of Clark Kent and Superman, becoming the first actor since Mr. Reeve to play the dual role on the big screen.  Routh is merely passable in each role, but doesn't possess the unique charisma required to completely earn either role.  There is a rote sense of being told that it's Clark Kent and Superman and the viewer takes it as a passive fact rather than investing emotionally in a legendary fictional American hero.  That is almost a fatal flaw in itself, but the movie also squanders a fine Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor by foisting recycled bits of Gene Hackman's storyline on him.  Kate Bosworth gives one of the best performances of the movie as Lois Lane.  I love Bosworth's Lois Lane, in part because it was one of the only characterizations that didn't strain to capture some sort of irretrievable original ideal.  Frank Langella as Perry White and Sam Huntington as Jimmy Olsen are both also marvelous because they are allowed to be authentic to this film.  Eva Marie Saint is excellent as Martha Kent but underutilized.  I wish Anthony Hopkins had been Jor-El for this, as rumored.  As much as I love Marlon Brando's interpretation, the late actor's presence in this movie was an odd reminder of its inferiority to the original ""Superman"" movie.  Mr. Hopkins' talent and gravitas would have given this movie its own heft.  John Williams' awesome score is always fun to hear, but is another unneeded anchor on this movie.  Noel Neill and Jack Larson, co-stars on the 1950's TV show ""The Adventures of Superman,"" have good cameos in this movie.This is a ""Superman"" movie that does achieve a unique look.  Metropolis looks extraordinarily modern but in certain artistic ways the movie nods to the 1930's, the decade which produced the first ""Superman"" comic book.  The Superman suit itself looks like somewhat of a stylistic throwback to that era.  A Superman who struggles with the affects of the immense tasks he undertakes references the Fleischer Brothers' cartoons of the 1940's as well as ""Superman: The Animated Series.""  There is even a re-creation of the cover art of ""Action Comics #1.""This is a moderately good ""Superman"" movie which could have been great if it had mustered the courage to break away from its classic predecessor, and find its own voice.",3,"I wish a firmer unique touch had been applied, but ""Superman Returns"" is not as bad as some say",1288569600,"11 1, 2010",2010,2779,"['SPOILERS', 'FOLLOWChristopher', 'Reeve', 'immense', 'shadow', 'entire', 'Superman', 'legend', 'well-chronicled', 'brilliance', 'role', 'even', 'somewhat', 'bossed', 'parts', 'movie', 'being', 'pale', 'copy', 'lines', 'scenes', 'mostly', 'original', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'Superman', 'film', 'problem', 'should', ""n't"", 'begin', 'review', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'mentioning', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'short', 'movie', 'directed', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'serious', 'identity', 'problem.Here', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'roles', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Superman', 'becoming', 'first', 'actor', 'Mr.', 'Reeve', 'play', 'dual', 'role', 'big', 'screen', 'Routh', 'merely', 'passable', 'role', ""n't"", 'possess', 'unique', 'charisma', 'required', 'completely', 'earn', 'role', 'rote', 'sense', 'being', 'told', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Superman', 'viewer', 'passive', 'fact', 'rather', 'investing', 'emotionally', 'legendary', 'fictional', 'American', 'hero', 'almost', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'movie', 'also', 'fine', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'foisting', 'recycled', 'bits', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'storyline', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'movie', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'love', 'Bosworth', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'part', 'was', 'one', 'only', 'characterizations', 'did', ""n't"", 'strain', 'capture', 'sort', 'irretrievable', 'original', 'ideal', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'Perry', 'White', 'Sam', 'Huntington', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'are', 'also', 'marvelous', 'are', 'allowed', 'be', 'authentic', 'film', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'excellent', 'Martha', 'Kent', 'underutilized', 'wish', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'had', 'been', 'Jor-El', 'rumored', 'As', 'much', 'love', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'interpretation', 'late', 'actor', 'presence', 'movie', 'was', 'odd', 'reminder', 'inferiority', 'original', 'Superman', 'movie', 'Mr.', 'Hopkins', 'talent', 'gravitas', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'movie', 'own', 'heft', 'John', 'Williams', 'awesome', 'score', 'always', 'fun', 'hear', 'unneeded', 'anchor', 'movie', 'Noel', 'Neill', 'Jack', 'Larson', 'co-stars', '1950', 'TV', 'show', 'Adventures', 'Superman', 'have', 'good', 'cameos', 'movie.This', 'Superman', 'movie', 'achieve', 'unique', 'look', 'Metropolis', 'extraordinarily', 'modern', 'certain', 'artistic', 'ways', 'movie', 'nods', '1930', 'decade', 'produced', 'first', 'Superman', 'comic', 'book', 'Superman', 'suit', 'somewhat', 'stylistic', 'throwback', 'era', 'Superman', 'who', 'affects', 'immense', 'tasks', 'Fleischer', 'Brothers', 'cartoons', '1940', 'as', 'well', 'Superman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'even', 're-creation', 'cover', 'art', 'Action', 'Comics', '1', 'moderately', 'good', 'Superman', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'had', 'mustered', 'courage', 'break', 'away', 'classic', 'predecessor', 'find', 'own', 'voice']",N/A

Everything about the movie worked, and so when I went to see SUPERMAN RETURNS, it was up against my memories of that previous classic. I hated the movie - I even fell asleep during it in the theater. Forward to the following year, and I bought the Ultimate Superman Collection, which included this movie. I eagerly watched all the other movies and material in the collection, but left SUPERMAN RETURNS in the box. A few years later, I took it out to give it a second chance. I still didn't like it. Just recently however, in June 2013, I had a friend over to my house for a full day of Superman TV shows and movies, in preparation to go see MAN OF STEEL. She told me she never saw SUPERMAN RETURNS, so, I reluctantly took it out of the set and put it on for her. This time, some six years after the fact, I really enjoyed this movie. It was like I saw it for the first time. I can now appreciate what director Bryan Singer was up against at the time. SUPERMAN RETURNS Takes place five years after the events of SUPERMAN 1978, Although in reality, this movie came out 28 years later after the fact. Times have changed, as well as filmmaking technology, and so the movie has a much darker look than the original. The characters are much more serious, and there's just not that sense of fun that was in that original Superman movie. Get over that, and you have a very good, well - enacted story, with superb production values.

Since the first comic was published, the heroes of the books have been handled with different authors, different artists, different styles for different times. A Superman comic from the 50's looks quite different than one from the 70's, and again different from today. Just as no one artist ""owns"" the Superman storytelling style, no one actor should ""own"" the role -- or the franchise. Superheroes deserve the ongoing life their comic book counterparts enjoy, always being reinvigorated for new times by new artists and new storytellers with fresh approaches to the material.That said, ""Superman Returns"" is the ideal theatrical acknowledgement of this process. It's a shot of adrenaline to the legend of Superman by a storyteller (Singer) whose take on the canon is at once new and reverently faithful.""Superman Returns"" is a square-jawed superhero movie with breathtaking action sequences, romance and a moral core that makes good vs. evil seem relevant rather than dated. And yet, it's nothing more radical than was being done in the 50's.As a guy who grew up with Christopher Reeve's version of Superman, who spent hours outside theaters in lines for the first three Superman movies of Reeve's series, I was touched to hear the rousing John Williams score and to see Marlon Brando back as Jor-El. The story is rock solid. Sorry to the filmmakers of Superman III, but this is what Superman III should have been.I loved all the actors, including Brandon Routh, who does Superman justice in all the right ways and who I sincerely hope will be back for the role in the next outing.

Lois Lane has a child (by Superman) and a relationship with another man, but still kinda has a crush on Superman.  Great.  I guess this paves the way for them to have an affair in Superman Returns Again.  Being a Superman fan, this really pretty much ruined the movie for me.  Grade: 'F'Brandon Routh--Did a good Superman.  I think he upheld the Chris Reeve tradition.  He didn't have a clue about Clark Kent, though, while Chris nailed them both.

A one-dimensional Lois Lane from Hell.  She was basically a bitter witch from beginning to end.  There were no redeeming qualities in her.  She was miserable and unlikeable and her lines were delivered without much real feeling.  I'll give part of the blame to the scripting on that.  Grade: 'F'Kevin Spacey as Lex.

1023450,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000J10EQU,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[9, 9]","Continuity-wise, Superman Returns takes place 5 years after the events of Superman II (1981). Superman has just returned after years of searching deep space for remnants of his native planet Krypton. But, while he was gone, the world had shrugged and continued to spin without him. As Clark Kent, he gets his old job back as mild-mannered reporter for the Daily Planet. But things are definitely not back to normal. Lois Lane, to his dismay, has moved on. She's now the mother of a young, asthmatic boy and is engaged to Perry White's nephew Richard. She's even won the Pulitzer Prize for her article ""Why the World Doesn't Need Superman"" (ouch!). Lex Luthor, too, is up and about, released from prison due to a technicality: Superman didn't make his court date to testify against him. Lex's new master plan is to use Kryptonian technology to raise a land mass while simultaneously sinking much of the U.S. of A. After all, real estate is where it's at. He also has an ace up his sleeve with regards to the Big Red ""S"".So I went to see this movie in deep, hopeful anticipation. I wanted to be able to tell people that it did justice to the Christopher Reeve classics. Afterwards, I walked away somewhat with mixed feelings but, overall, leaning towards the positive. Superman Returns was certainly entertaining and filled with great f/x, but, no, I don't feel it lived up to all the hoop-la (but, then again, it would have to have been just about the perfect film to be worthy of all the monster pre-screening pub it got). While Superman Returns truly is an epic effort, it falls short of Superman I & II. Yes, it has its moments of sheer majesty and scope, but it lacks enough of those quiet, little personal touches that allow the audience to fully connect with the movie. Scenes with Lois and Clark, which, to me, were some of the hallmark moments in Superman I & II, are too few in Superman Returns. Routh should've been given more scenes as Clark Kent as he's the one that grounds Superman to reality and the one whom we usually identify with the most in the film. Also, one of the challenges in doing a Superman flick is ensuring that the Man of Steel has a worthy adversary. This time out, Lex Luthor proves to be a subpar opponent. And how many times can one introduce kryptonite as a weapon?Brandon Routh does a very good job. Yes, it helps that there's a vague resemblance between him and Christopher Reeve. And, yes, Routh channels Reeve in much the same way Ewan McGregor channels Alec Guinness in Star Wars. Routh ably captures Clark Kent's personal quirks and mannerisms, and even sounds eerily like Reeve at times. But Brandon Routh is no Christopher Reeve. Here's the difference: Reeve's Superman had an almost self-deprecating, straight-faced-but-with-a-wink attitude about him. We felt that, while Supes does have abilities beyond those of mortal men, there was still a humanizing element about him that enabled us to put ourselves in his place. But Routh's Superman is so aware of the all-encompassing mission his father had given him that he comes off as somewhat aloof and detached. Oh, he smiles and waves but there isn't that same warmth we felt exuding from Reeve. In Superman I and II, it was Clark Kent who was playing Superman. In Superman Returns, Clark Kent seems to be the disguise.Director Bryan Singer goes to great extent in showing the audience what it feels like for Kal-El to co-exist with beings infinitely more fragile than him, and the isolation and loneliness of his unending burden. Singer employs recurring shots of Superman hovering in space, gazing watchfully down on his adopted planet (or sometimes with his eyes close, so as to better focus his superhearing for any plea for aid). Superman's own personal life, in his own mind, must ever take a backseat to his ongoing pursuit of truth, justice and cheesecake.Kate Bosworth is not as good as Margot Kidder or Teri Hatcher here, but she has room to grow. She lacks that certain sassiness that is a hallmark of Lois Lane. Given, Lois now has a child and is engaged, and is probably thrown off-keeled by Superman's return. But, still, I longed for that smart-alecky gleam in her eyes. Ah, well. Maybe, next time...Frank Langella is not crusty enough as Perry White, while Sam Huntington as Jimmy Olsen is forgettable. Eva Marie Saint, whom I loved in North by Northwest, didn't have enough screen time as Martha Kent. Kevin Spacey is on and off as Supe's arch nemesis Lex Luthor. There is one standout scene, though, which takes place on Lex's cruiseship, in which Lex, in traditional villainous, braggadocious fashion, unveils his mad scheme to Lois and then taunts her about Superman's guaranteed inability to foil his plan - this time. Parker Posey as Lex's sidekick chick Kitty is very funny and steals some scenes.So, I do recommend this film: for its sheer grandeur, the sense of nostalgia it invokes, and its sincere striving to be great. The production values are excellent and will make you believe that a Superman can fly at supersonic speeds, wrestle down a space shuttle, and stop a bullet with his eyeball. And this is only Brandon Routh's first try as the Man of Steel and there are sequels undoubtedly planned, so I expect him to grow into this role. Welcome back, Superman.

Singer's adaptation is very true to the late 70ies/80ies films featuring Christopher Reeve. One might even say it's yet another part of the series. The titles are very much like the classic films, even John Williams's famous Superman theme is featured prominently throughout the film and Brandon Routh could be some secret offspring of Christopher Reeve. Kate Bosworth makes a wonderful Lois Lane and best of all Kevin Spacey absolutely rules as Lex Luthor.In the film Superman returns to Earth after a five year quest through space to learn the world has moved on: Lois Lane has won the Pulitzer Prize for an article entitled ""Why The World Doesn't Need Superman"" and has pretty much forgotten all about her savior. In his Clark Kent guise Superman gets his job back at the daily planet, but he struggles to overcome the obstacles he faces in Lois Lane's life: Aside from her anger for leaving without a word she now has a son and a fiance. Superman's arch rival Lex Luthor has successfully conned himself out of his double life sentence and is plotting once again sinister schemes to rule the planet. Only in time does Lois Lane realize that the world does indeed need Superman and so does she....The entire film has been shot digitally using Sony's/Panavision's new Genesis camera; the first camera that features a 35mm sized chip for image capturing. Keeping the chip film-sized enables filmmakers to use the wide variety of lenses out there for tradititonal 35mm film cameras and guarantees the same depth of field as we know it from film. Visual effects have increased by leaps and bounds since Richard Donner's 1978 installment yet they also command respect for their efforts back in the day.All in all Superman Returns is an honest, solid, very well done Superman film, that truth to tell might have benefitted from a little more action here and there, but other than that a valiant effort, a definite DVD to buy!",4,Superman Returns digitally,1161129600,"10 18, 2006",2006,2106,"['Director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'X-men', '1', '2', 'Superman', 'silver', 'screen', '19', 'years', 'utilizing', 'latest', 'technology', 'revive', 'now', '73', 'year', 'old', 'legend', 'today', 'audiences', 'Singer', 'adaptation', 'very', 'true', 'late', '70ies/80ies', 'films', 'featuring', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'One', 'might', 'even', 'say', 'yet', 'part', 'series', 'titles', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'classic', 'films', 'even', 'John', 'Williams', 'famous', 'Superman', 'theme', 'featured', 'prominently', 'film', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'could', 'be', 'secret', 'offspring', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'wonderful', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'best', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'absolutely', 'rules', 'Lex', 'Luthor.In', 'film', 'Superman', 'Earth', 'five', 'year', 'quest', 'space', 'learn', 'world', 'moved', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'won', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'article', 'entitled', 'Why', 'World', 'Does', ""n't"", 'Need', 'Superman', 'pretty', 'much', 'forgotten', 'savior', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'guise', 'Superman', 'job', 'back', 'daily', 'planet', 'overcome', 'obstacles', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'life', 'Aside', 'anger', 'leaving', 'word', 'now', 'son', 'fiance', 'Superman', 'arch', 'rival', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'successfully', 'conned', 'double', 'life', 'sentence', 'plotting', 'once', 'again', 'sinister', 'schemes', 'rule', 'planet', 'Only', 'time', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'realize', 'world', 'indeed', 'need', 'Superman', 'so', '.The', 'entire', 'film', 'been', 'shot', 'digitally', 'using', ""Sony's/Panavision"", 'new', 'Genesis', 'camera', 'first', 'camera', '35mm', 'sized', 'chip', 'image', 'capturing', 'Keeping', 'chip', 'film-sized', 'filmmakers', 'use', 'wide', 'variety', 'lenses', 'there', 'tradititonal', '35mm', 'film', 'cameras', 'same', 'depth', 'field', 'know', 'film', 'Visual', 'effects', 'have', 'increased', 'leaps', 'bounds', 'Richard', 'Donner', '1978', 'installment', 'yet', 'also', 'command', 'respect', 'efforts', 'back', 'day.All', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'honest', 'solid', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Superman', 'film', 'tell', 'might', 'have', 'benefitted', 'little', 'more', 'action', 'here', 'there', 'other', 'valiant', 'effort', 'definite', 'DVD', 'buy']",N/A

When I saw all of the marketing and posters for the movie I thought Brandon Routh was going to be an absolute disaster. Boy, was I wrong. I didn't see it in the theaters for several weeks after release because I was so adamant about not liking it. But I eventually came around to seeing it and was pleasantly surprised. I thought Routh and director Bryan Singer did a good job with this. I found myself really liking the movie. I didn't think anyone could follow the iconic Christopher Reeve in this role. And I was kind of sad that studio executives thought that he could be replaced so easily, that people were just going to forget about him and embrace whatever they threw up on the screen. It's only been two years since his death, so I though it was somewhat insulating to even consider bringing this movie back without him. But Routh did an admirable job. He was convincing. But I think a lot will hinge on the movies that follow as to whether or not this new remake franchise sinks or swims. I thought the beginning of the film was somewhat confusing, but once it got going it was very good. I thought Kevin Spacey was a good choice as Lex Luthor and Parker Posey is always great. So it will be interesting to see the film that follows. The real question is whether Singer can really build and expand upon this one and get those that were on the fringe before into the theater? I would encourage people that were hesitant to see this in the theater to at least give it a chance. This was challenging from the beginning with the soaring production costs and just dealing with the whole legacy that Reeve left behind. It was brave to remake this series so soon and some would probably argue somewhat foolish. But in all, this was a very enjoyable movie.

Paul,"[2, 3]","First off, if you have not seen the original movies make sure to watch at least Superman and Superman 2 if at all possible before watching this movie. The story draws heavily from some pinnacle events that occured in these 2 movies. If you have never seen these 2 movies the first hour or so of this movie might leave you scratching your head about what is going on.So first of all I want to say Bryan Singer is THE MAN! He has a passion for what he does and it really shows in his work. He has gone to great lengths to create a stellar movie and yet remain loyal to the fan base of the previous movies and the TV series that my mom watched when she was a kid.I think Brandon and Kate do a marvelous job, but they are not Christopher and Margot. It was hard for me to set that aside and try to watch the movie without bias at first. My only gripe about Brandon is his Clark Kent is really weak. Christopher Reeve had this part DOWN. He hunched as Clark and stammered and tripped and was basically the polar opposite of Superman. Brandon's Clark was just a little too confident I thought. He seemed like Superman in a suit with glasses.... Trying to play Lois Lane in this movie would be difficult to accomplish. There would be a lot of emotion and inner conflict involved. I don't think Kate pulled this off well enough, but for a first attempt I will cut everyone some slack.I was VERY skeptical about this movie and I had not planned to watch it at first because of the love I held for the originals and especially Christopher Reeve.

1023458,A3AB2C5MSGFI2T,B000J10EQU,"Hitesh ""Acehit""","[12, 25]","I have just watched this movie for the first time, and I have to say I am very dissapointed. To be honest I had no intention of really watching this movie, being a die hard fan of the originals I was displeased right from the word go when I saw Brandon in what appeared to be an innapriopriate dark suite.I am a huge Superman fan, and I don't have any problems with a remake as long as it's done right, but on this occasion it was all wrong.This film is almost a recycled version of the original Superman movie, there is no freshness to it or originality.1. The movie begins, and we see the opening credits in a fashion that resembled that of the original films, ok I didnt have any real problems with this as its a continuation, but I would've preffered a fresh new approach to this. Plus if Singer was going to do it this way, it doesn't make sense hiring a young guy like Routh to play a character that by the time his back would've aged a little.2. Superman returns to Earth from trying to discover Krypton, but this in itself just doesn't work because anybody with even half a brain would realise that is Superman is back, what a coincidence that Clarke is back too. Surely there would be someone smart enough to figure that one out.3. Supermans first rescue is to help a plane, with Lois in it. Once again we here the same dialogue that was in the original film 'Statistically speaking its still the safest way to travel.' Lois gets rescued from air and than faints when the plane is landed, a not too different scenario from the first movie again.4. Superman flies to Lois's and we hear the same dialogue 'you really shouldnt smoke' borrowed from the first film. Than they go for a flight before he drops her off to her appartment. Just a recycled scene from superman 1.4. The soundtrack again was just a recycled version of the original movies, why not create something new here instead of borrowing the same cues as Williams, there were some different tunes at different stages of the film but there were more problems here. The Superman theme was played at innappropriate times, when it didn't really fit in with the scenes. Also it was the same recognisable tune repeating all throughout the movie.5. Another recycled scene from the first movie is when Superman is affected by Kryptonite whilst in Water.  This happened in the original movie, and we get a recycled version of the scene in this new movie too.6. There weren't really any exciting transformations from clarke to superman, we probably only saw him change about twice in the film, but to see the transition from clarke to superman is supposed to the highlight of these movies. It's what Donnor and Lester knew, and they did it right in their films.7. Now for the biggest problem of all, the Suite! This was far from perfect. If they can't even get Superman's colours right, than it just goes to show how much the producers were passionate about the character. His colours are red, blue and yellow, not plum, beige and darke blue! The suite was ridiculously dark, and not only that the material wasn't right. His suite is not supposed to be rubber or leather, this isn't batman! the cape itself is supposed to drape over the shoulders, it just didn't look right the way it was.Now do you see my point. Why didn't Singer just start a fresh, it would've been so much better. This way there were too many inconsistences, and to be honest I thought it stole too many elements from the original movies. The special affects were all fine, I didnt really have any problems with the flying scenes, I actually quite liked the x-ray vision.This is what I think, maybe I'm just a purist but I guess everyone is entitled to their own view but if you watch Superman returns and the 1978 Superman side by side you'll know what I mean.peace",1,A film that does no justice to the greatest superhero!,1166313600,"12 17, 2006",2006,3797,"['have', 'just', 'watched', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'very', 'dissapointed', 'be', 'honest', 'had', 'intention', 'really', 'watching', 'movie', 'being', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'originals', 'was', 'displeased', 'right', 'word', 'go', 'when', 'saw', 'Brandon', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'innapriopriate', 'dark', 'suite.I', 'am', 'huge', 'Superman', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problems', 'remake', 'as', 'long', 'done', 'right', 'occasion', 'was', 'wrong.This', 'film', 'almost', 'recycled', 'version', 'original', 'Superman', 'movie', 'freshness', 'originality.1', 'movie', 'see', 'opening', 'credits', 'fashion', 'resembled', 'original', 'films', 'ok', 'didnt', 'have', 'real', 'problems', 'continuation', 'would', ""'ve"", 'preffered', 'fresh', 'new', 'approach', 'Singer', 'was', 'going', 'do', 'way', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'hiring', 'young', 'guy', 'Routh', 'play', 'character', 'time', 'back', 'would', ""'ve"", 'aged', 'little.2', 'Superman', 'Earth', 'trying', 'discover', 'Krypton', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'anybody', 'even', 'brain', 'would', 'realise', 'Superman', 'back', 'what', 'coincidence', 'Clarke', 'back', 'too', 'Surely', 'would', 'be', 'someone', 'smart', 'enough', 'figure', 'one', 'out.3', 'Supermans', 'first', 'rescue', 'help', 'plane', 'Lois', 'Once', 'again', 'here', 'same', 'dialogue', 'was', 'original', 'film', ""'Statistically"", 'speaking', 'still', 'safest', 'way', 'travel', 'Lois', 'rescued', 'air', 'faints', 'when', 'plane', 'landed', 'not', 'too', 'different', 'scenario', 'first', 'movie', 'again.4', 'Superman', 'Lois', 'hear', 'same', 'dialogue', 'really', 'shouldnt', 'smoke', 'borrowed', 'first', 'film', 'go', 'flight', 'off', 'appartment', 'Just', 'recycled', 'scene', 'superman', '1.4', 'soundtrack', 'again', 'was', 'just', 'recycled', 'version', 'original', 'movies', 'why', 'not', 'create', 'something', 'new', 'here', 'instead', 'borrowing', 'same', 'cues', 'Williams', 'were', 'different', 'tunes', 'different', 'stages', 'film', 'were', 'more', 'problems', 'here', 'Superman', 'theme', 'was', 'played', 'innappropriate', 'times', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit', 'scenes', 'Also', 'was', 'same', 'recognisable', 'tune', 'repeating', 'movie.5', 'recycled', 'scene', 'first', 'movie', 'when', 'Superman', 'affected', 'Kryptonite', 'whilst', 'Water', 'happened', 'original', 'movie', 'get', 'recycled', 'version', 'scene', 'new', 'movie', 'too.6', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'exciting', 'transformations', 'clarke', 'superman', 'probably', 'only', 'saw', 'change', 'twice', 'film', 'see', 'transition', 'clarke', 'superman', 'supposed', 'highlight', 'movies', 'what', 'Donnor', 'Lester', 'knew', 'did', 'right', 'films.7', 'Now', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Suite', 'was', 'far', 'perfect', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'Superman', 'colours', 'right', 'just', 'show', 'how', 'much', 'producers', 'were', 'passionate', 'character', 'colours', 'are', 'red', 'blue', 'yellow', 'not', 'plum', 'beige', 'darke', 'blue', 'suite', 'was', 'ridiculously', 'dark', 'not', 'only', 'material', 'was', ""n't"", 'right', 'suite', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'rubber', 'leather', ""n't"", 'batman', 'cape', 'supposed', 'drape', 'shoulders', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'right', 'way', 'do', 'see', 'point', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Singer', 'just', 'start', 'fresh', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'way', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'inconsistences', 'be', 'honest', 'thought', 'stole', 'too', 'many', 'elements', 'original', 'movies', 'special', 'affects', 'were', 'fine', 'didnt', 'really', 'have', 'problems', 'flying', 'scenes', 'actually', 'quite', 'liked', 'x-ray', 'vision.This', 'what', 'think', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'purist', 'guess', 'everyone', 'entitled', 'own', 'view', 'watch', 'Superman', 'returns', '1978', 'Superman', 'side', 'side', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean.peace']",N/A

The plot twists and turns are quite well-done, and Bryan Singer knows how to direct a superhero movie, as evidenced by the original ""X-Men"" and ""X-Men 2"", but he goes beyond that; he gives us characters we can care about and sympathize with. Having Lois engaged to another man after Superman has been gone five years is a wonderful twist to the plot, and even more so her having a son (which I think everyone can figure out the child's parentage by the end of the movie). Brandon Routh is a worthy successor to the late Christopher Reeve, as is Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane a worthy successor to Margot Kidder. Frank Langella is terrific as Perry White, and James Marsden (Cyclops from the ""X-Men"" movies). The young actor who played young Jason, Lois' son, was great too.

1023461,A3N0AXNEZVE686,B000J10EQU,Hound Dog,"[2, 2]","In the Summer of 2006, nearly twenty years after Superman last soared across movie screens, the much-delayed, much hyped ""Superman Returns"" premiered to mostly positive feedback from moviegoers and better-than-average acclaim from film critics.  Yet, despite racking up an astronomical total of nearly $400 million dollars worldwide in box office receipts, the movie was still deemed a relative failure, and, as of this date, shockingly enough, a sequel isn't even on the horizon yet.  Why, one wonders?  The pieces for a successful update of the beloved Superman film franchise were seemingly all there: a relatively solid cast (including Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor); a virtually limitless special effects budget; the classic score by John Williams; and, most importantly, a truly sincere appreciation for Richard Donner's original films starring Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman from 1978 and 1981.  Yet, like some puzzles, this film's pieces simply didn't all fit because they were put in the wrong order.  For that very reason, ""Superman Returns"" could have and should have been better than the finished product.In terms of the storyline, director Bryan Singer and his co-screenwriters lovingly reference the original Donner films repeatedly, including never-before-seen footage of the late Marlon Brando as Jor-El.  As much as I enjoyed these generous helpings of nostalgia, the recurring problem is that this film completely lacks the romantic exuberance and playful charm that Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder had previously embued.  Instead, good-natured charm is replaced here by some surprisingly dark scenes of violence (inappropriate for young viewers, I might add).  Considering that ""Superman Returns"" clocks in at roughly two and a half hours, the absence of any tongue-in-cheek comic relief is mind-boggling, and, as a result, the film really sags at times.  Further, Kevin Spacey's Lex Luthor needs to take an originality pill, as his latest land grab scheme seems nothing more than a more intense reworking of Gene Hackman's original Luthor.  Aside from Luthor, a new villain like Brainiac or even Doomsday would have made more sense to avoid criticism that this film borrows too often from the Donner films.Second, while Kevin Spacey is no doubt a perfect choice as Lex Luthor, he isn't able to carry this movie alone.  Romantic leads Brandon Routh (as Superman/Clark Kent) and Kate Bosworth (as Lois Lane) aren't able to muster any magical chemistry together despite their best efforts.  Routh is passable as the Man of Steel, and, if a sequel is ever made, he deserves another chance to improve upon his performance, which simply lacks the timeless charisma and depth Reeve had brought to the role.  As for Bosworth, she is a solid actress, but she is completely miscast here.  Singer's miscalculation casting Bosworth isn't nearly as bad as hapless Denise Richards playing a nuclear scientist next to Pierce Brosnan's 007 ten years ago, but it still ranks about the same as Katie Holmes' forgettable performance as an assistant DA in ""Batman Begins,"" in 2005.  In other words, Mia Kirshner and Megan Fox should be front runners for the next incarnation of Lois Lane.However, ""Superman Returns"" has a strong supporting cast of James Marsden, Frank Langella, Parker Posey, Eva Marie Saint, and Sam Huntington, in addition to cameos from Jack Larson, Noel Neill, and, of course, Marlon Brando.  Also, the young actor playing Lois' young son does an excellent job, although his character's presence is rather unsettling when one considers who his father turns out to be (a subtle hint about ""Superman II."")  Speaking of which, I'll give Bryan Singer credit for coming up with at least one original plot twist, but the romantic love triangle between Routh, Bosworth, and Marsden should have been permanently resolved by the film's end.  Instead, the film's conclusion, unfortunately, is rather unsatisfying after well over two hours building up to it.Third and lastly, the film's production design and special effects are, no question, simply awesome (countless millions of dollars will do that).  However, Singer, I think, again miscalculated by relying far too much on computer-generated effects (sometimes, they are incredibly obvious), because it feels often like one is watching a video game's graphics.  Further, Routh often seems indistinguishable from his CGI counterpart, and I'm afraid that's not a compliment because his expressionless face doesn't convey that it's really him flying.  Make no mistake: Christopher Reeve made his flying sequences exhilarating fun because you could actually see his facial expressions clearly enough to make one believe in the fantasy that he really is flying.  Routh, in comparison, instead looks more like another special effect.Despite all of the nostalgic joy I felt hearing John Williams' familiar score (not to mention, the ghostly echoes of Marlon Brando's distinctive voice) once more, I think ""Superman Returns"" ultimately missed a wonderful opportunity to send the Man of Steel soaring into the 21st Century.  This movie simply forgot to borrow the one vital element the 1978 Donner film possessed more than anything else: charming, adventurous fun with a classy sense of humor.  Nonetheless, despite its flaws, ""Superman Returns"" is still well worth seeing for the loving homage to Christopher Reeve's memory, and to ours of him as the timeless Man of Steel.Rating: a strong 3/5. (Please think twice before letting pre-teenagers watch this movie).",3,Superman Returns: Enjoy the Homage for What It's Worth,1252022400,"09 4, 2009",2009,5524,"['Summer', '2006', 'nearly', 'twenty',

1023464,A192KEPM0HW6AC,B000J10EQU,"Interplanetary Funksmanship ""Swift lippin', e...","[5, 6]","After a nearly two-decades-long absence, the Man of Steel returns to the big screen in this superb fifth installment in the Superman series. But this belated movie is actually more of a sequel to the first two Superman films, the second released a quarter century ago in 1981.Director Richard Donner, novelist Mario Puzo, and uncredited screenwriter Tom Manckiewicz (listed as ""creative consultant"" in credits) conceived the initial outing, Superman: The Movie (1978), as a legendary epic of almost Shakespearian dimensions, a saga pitting good versus evil. Unfortunately, their lofty vision was not shared by producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind. Uncomfortable with a serious treatment of the Superman story, they brought in the husband/wife screenwriting team David and Leslie Newman to make the script more ""campy,"" &agrave; la the 1960s ""Batman"" TV series.As a result of creative differences, and the Salkinds' refusal to pay Marlon Brando's steep royalties, Donner was replaced with director Richard Lester on the next installment, Superman II, and much of Donner's original footage was left on the proverbial cutting room floor. Fortunately, cinematic history has been kind to Richard Donner. On November 28, Warner Home Video finally releases his authorized version of Superman II, not only restoring scenes with Brando back into the film, but also restoring Donner to his rightful place as director.To understand the downward spiral of the Superman franchise, consider 1983's Superman III, written solely by the Newmans and directed by Lester. An appalling collection of poorly timed slapstick gags, it has earned the dubious distinction of being the only movie in which comedian Richard Pryor can't buy a laugh. Superman IV in 1987 was even more unwatchable, suffering from bargain-basement production values and a PC script that reduced Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's classic superhero to a ""No Nukes,"" Bleeding-Heart of Steel.Now, years after lesser filmmakers left the Man of Steel in rust, director Bryan Singer finally restores the untarnished, larger-than-life superhero to his pedestal.Comparisons between Superman Returns and Superman: The Movie are inevitable, especially because Singer and screenwriters Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris consciously planned this film to have the same look, feel, and sound of the original. The most obvious similarity is in casting relative newcomer Brandon Routh in the role of Superman/Kal-El/Clark Kent. Routh bears an uncanny resemblance to the young Christopher Reeve; indeed, he looks as though he could be Reeve's younger brother.Superman Returns builds upon the plot of the first Reeve movie, and part of the second. To explain Superman's absence from the screen during the past nineteen years, Singer brings him back to Earth after a five-year self-imposed exile, during which time he trekked among the stars searching for the remains of his home planet, Krypton.The movie opens with an amazing special-effects sequence as Superman's spaceborne ship hurtles through the galaxies back to Earth, returning to his family farm outside Smallville, USA. Voiceover monologue from his father, Jor-El--taken from Marlon Brando's unused footage for Superman II--sets the tone for the drama that follows. ""Because of their [Earthlings'] capacity for good, I send them you, my only son."" Using Christ-like visual imagery, Superman is cast as Earth's savior, rescuing the planet time and again from those who wield the capacity for evil.After a brief reunion with earthly mother Martha Kent, played by Eva Marie Saint, Superman reclaims his alter ego, Clark Kent, and his job in Metropolis as reporter for the Daily Planet. Things haven't changed much at the paper, except that cell phones have replaced desk sets and typewriters have been retired in favor of personal computers. Otherwise, editor Perry White (Frank Langella) is just as gruff as ever. Shutterbug Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) is still the same earnest greenhorn, and the only reporter in the MSM, aside from Tucker Carlson, still sporting a tacky bow tie.But one important thing has changed. When Superman left on his intergalactic quest for his roots, former lover Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), the Planet's ace reporter, believed she'd been ditched. Feeling betrayed, Lois won a Pulitzer Prize for an article, ""Why the World Doesn't Need Superman."" ""The world doesn't need a savior,"" she tells Clark, ""and neither do I."" He is devastated to learn that, on the rebound, she has given her heart to Richard White (James Marsden), the boss's nephew. What's worse, Lois and Richard now have a son, Jason.Meanwhile, having discovered Superman's secret hideaway, the Fortress of Solitude, arch-enemy Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) launches a diabolical scheme using crystals laced with Kryptonite--the radioactive remains of Superman's planet that render him powerless. Placed in the Atlantic Ocean, the crystals multiply, creating a huge, artificial island that displaces enough ocean water to threaten much of North America with flooding. It's an ecological disaster right out of Al Gore's most fanciful nightmares, one that will force millions to turn to Luthor if they want to stay dry. Cha-ching!Brandon Routh more than fills Chris Reeve's boots, and also those of George Reeves, the square-jawed actor who portrayed Superman in serial movies and on television during the 1950s. Like Reeve, Routh convincingly projects the superheroic qualities of Herculean strength and speed, as well as honor, chivalry, and courage. However, this loner-hero is cast in a more human, vulnerable light, though without ever mocking his dignity and heroic stature. This is a nobler Superman: all the annoying touches that in previous movies were meant to undermine the character are absent here.Every superhero needs a supervillain in order to bring out his best virtues, and the movie delivers by casting Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor. Although Gene Hackman is a great actor, he underplayed in the Luthor role a generation ago, almost to the point of nonchalance. Part of his failure to portray a true supervillain was due to his goofy wardrobe and even goofier sidekick (Ned Beatty). The sheer silliness undercut his credibility as a viable threat to Superman.By contrast, Spacey's Luthor is a plausible adversary for the Man of Steel. ""Gods are selfish beings who fly around in little red capes and don't share their powers with anyone else,"" Luthor snarls. Spacey's characterization conveys that, for little men with big ambitions, envy of the good can be the most corrupting motive. When I first saw Spacey in American Beauty (1999), his smarminess as anti-hero Lester Burnham really rubbed me the wrong way. But after seeing him as Jack Lemmon's duplicitous boss in Glengarry Glen Ross and as the deliciously sociopathic Luthor here, I find him uniquely suited to playing cads and villains--not unlike George Sanders (Rebecca, All About Eve) a couple generations ago.Kate Bosworth is somewhat less successful as Lois Lane. Undoubtedly a better actress than the previous Lois (Margot Kidder), Bosworth's waifish looks and spiral curls aren't what come to mind when you think of the spunky journalist from the DC comic books. A stronger, more alluring actress, such as Hilary Swank, would have been perfect to play the female lead in Superman's life.All in all, however, Superman Returns is a widescreen extravaganza with something for everyone.For the guys, it has street cred as an action flick, with its shoot-'em-up pyrotechnics and computer-generated images. These are truly spectacular, because they don't look so much like special effects as like natural camerawork. In fact, this film comes off as even more realistic than another visually impressive superhero flick, Spiderman II.For the women in the audience, the movie offers a heart-rending story of unrequited love, though hinting at the possible reconciliation of the (literally) star-crossed lovers in the next film in the franchise, planned for release in 2009.For fans of John Williams's soaring score in the 1978 film, there is composer John Ottman's skillful weaving of Williams's brassy fanfare into the new soundtrack, and conductor Damon Intrabartolo's lush interpretation.For older movie buffs, Superman Returns also boasts the first reunion (in dialogue, thanks to the sound editors) of the late Marlon Brando and actress Eva Marie Saint since they appeared as working-class lovers in Elia Kazan's 1954 classic, On the Waterfront.And for the kids, the picture provides not just grand entertainment but also some wonderful lessons. Its themes of gallantry, honor, and bravery will cause even many adults to revert to the child's uncorrupted and innocent point of view. In fact, when we saw this movie at an advance critics' screening--in midtown Manhattan, no less--that was exactly how that normally blas&eacute; audience reacted.If a bunch of aging, cynical critics can ""Wow!"" aloud at the implausible actions of their childhood hero, boo and jeer at the soulless villain, and rise to a raucous standing ovation at the end, then Superman Returns may just be the savior that Hollywood has needed during all the years that he's been gone.",4,Untarnished,1179619200,"05 20, 2007",2007,9201,"['nearly', 'two-decades-long', 'absence', 'Man', 'Steel', 'returns',

1023465,A278ABYYACM3Y7,B000J10EQU,"Ivan Ramirez V ""Kal-El from Krypton""","[2, 5]","Much discuss has raised around whether or not this is the movie we've have been waiting for. Bryan Singer is an amazing director, no question about that and his approach to the Man of Steel is very good, putting it ''back on track'' as the writers stated. Brandon Routh although not as charismatic as Chris Reeve, does the job and he is actually cool, thou the cape is still too big for him. Very cool special effects but...not outstanding!The movie did not live up to the studio's expectations so what went wrong? The problem is very simple: The difference between Singer's style and Michael Bay's for example is obvious: Singer shows slow paced action and Bay shows super high speed paced action. When we see Superman in action in the animated series and Justice League fighting and providing excitement you get entertainment. This movie fails to provide exactly that: action!!! That cheap talk about the sequel being that fast paced is just an excuse to say: ''sorry! We missed that here''. Being that we already had Superman-Doomsday where we see kicking butts this movie is all but disappointing. There is too much romance, cheesy, boring, and swamping. A boy who distracts Superman for what he really is: Earth's greatest hero. !! Oh and by the way: Is there another movie where the super hero had a son taking into account Supergirl, Reeve's Superman saga, X-Men, Dare Devil, Hulk, Electra, Wonder Woman, Flash or any other? No!!!! Simply no! That is nothing but stupid. Superman is defeated TWICE by Lex and by the huge landmass. He was treated by doctors in a hospital. I mean, give me a break! If this happened to him in this movie, Darkseid or Brainiac would simply clean the floor with him.They tried to humanize the hero, which is ok but too much melodrama and not action which leads to this: annoying. Actors playing fools like Kitty (in resemblance to miss Teschmacher) and betraying Lex...c'mon...the Lex from Smallville simply wipes them out of Earth but here this one just plays funny. A criminal mastermind playing funny! That is but absurd. There are many elements (like Cyclops) that are annoying, distracting and boring, just because they are friends with Singer. Singer owns to the fans, not to his friends. So my Superman fans, kudos to Bryan Singer for his interpretation but we demand ACTION, FAST SECUENCES! That is why it failed with the studio. If you see X-MEN III although not the best of the trilogy it has action and fights. Because a super hero movie in a drama format simply does not work. So if you are a Superman fan as well as I am go and get it, it has some entertainment and good subjects but if you are waiting for THE MOVIE, that it still has to come. They thought they got the movie but did not take into account how much the animated movies have developed the character, not to mention Smallville too. Hopefully they will exploit what this is really about in the sequel; otherwise the Superman character will be, as in the movie, defeated. Even worse the heroe, for the fans and generations to come, might be forgotten due to a boring ultra romantic stupid movie.",2,Superman Returns for a Small-ville of romantic boys and not action fans,1206921600,"03 31, 2008",2008,3107,"['Much', 'discuss', 'raised', 'not', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'amazing', 'director', 'question', 'approach', 'Man', 'Steel', 'very', 'good', 'putting', 'back', 'track', 'writers', 'stated', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'not', 'as', 'charismatic', 'Chris', 'Reeve', 'job', 'actually', 'cool', 'thou', 'cape', 'still', 'too', 'big', 'Very', 'cool', 'special', 'effects', 'not', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'studio', 'expectations', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'problem', 'very', 'simple', 'difference', 'Singer', 'style', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'example', 'obvious', 'Singer', 'slow', 'paced', 'action', 'Bay', 'super', 'high', 'speed', 'paced', 'action', 'When', 'see', 'Superman', 'action', 'animated', 'series', 'Justice', 'League', 'fighting', 'providing', 'excitement', 'get', 'entertainment', 'movie', 'provide', 'exactly', 'action', 'cheap', 'talk', 'sequel', 'being', 'fast', 'paced', 'just', 'excuse', 'say', 'sorry', 'missed', 'here', 'Being', 'already', 'had', 'Superman-Doomsday', 'where', 'see', 'kicking', 'butts', 'movie', 'disappointing', 'too', 'much', 'romance', 'cheesy', 'boring', 'swamping', 'boy', 'who', 'Superman', 'what', 'really', 'Earth', 'greatest', 'hero', 'Oh', 'way', 'movie', 'where', 'super', 'hero', 'had', 'son', 'taking', 'account', 'Supergirl', 'Reeve', 'Superman', 'saga', 'X-Men', 'Dare', 'Devil', 'Hulk', 'Electra', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Flash', 'other', 'No', 'Simply', 'nothing', 'stupid', 'Superman', 'defeated', 'TWICE', 'Lex', 'huge', 'landmass', 'was', 'treated', 'doctors', 'hospital', 'mean', 'give', 'break', 'happened', 'movie', 'Darkseid', 'Brainiac', 'would', 'simply', 'clean', 'floor', 'him.They', 'tried', 'humanize', 'hero', 'ok', 'too', 'much', 'melodrama', 'not', 'action', 'annoying', 'Actors', 'playing', 'fools', 'Kitty', 'resemblance', 'miss', 'Teschmacher', 'betraying', 'Lex', ""c'mon"", 'Lex', 'Smallville', 'simply', 'Earth', 'here', 'one', 'just', 'funny', 'criminal', 'mastermind', 'playing', 'funny', 'absurd', 'are', 'many', 'elements', 'Cyclops', 'are', 'annoying', 'distracting', 'boring', 'just', 'are', 'friends', 'Singer', 'Singer', 'fans', 'not', 'friends', 'Superman', 'fans', 'kudos', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'interpretation', 'demand', 'ACTION', 'FAST', 'SECUENCES', 'why', 'failed', 'studio', 'see', 'X-MEN', 'III', 'not', 'best', 'trilogy', 'action', 'fights', 'super', 'hero', 'movie', 'drama', 'format', 'simply', 'not', 'work', 'So', 'are', 'Superman', 'fan', 'as', 'well', 'am', 'go', 'get', 'entertainment', 'good', 'subjects', 'are', 'waiting', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'still', 'come', 'thought', 'got', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'account', 'how', 'much', 'animated', 'movies', 'have', 'developed', 'character', 'not', 'mention', 'Smallville', 'too', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'exploit', 'what', 'really', 'about', 'sequel', 'otherwise', 'Superman', 'character', 'will', 'be', 'movie', 'defeated', 'Even', 'worse', 'heroe', 'fans', 'generations', 'come', 'might', 'be', 'forgotten', 'due', 'boring', 'ultra', 'romantic', 'stupid', 'movie']",N/A

The story is absolutely dreadful. It's miscast from the get go. The entire cast was horrid, not just Routh. That costume was just sickening. Brown cape, trunks, and boots? No one ever thought Superman in blue and red was a bad idea. Not in the 1950s tv series, not in the comic books, not in the cartoons, not in any of the Christopher Reeve movies, not by the fans, not anywhere for the last 45 years of my 49 year life have I ever heard ""You know, that Superman is alright but he'd be a lot better if his cape, trunks, and boots were brown."" Give me a break! But nooooo! that dumbass punk Bryan Singer thinks messing &lt; (I really wanted to use the F word) with americana was a good thing. I even hate his X-men movies. Black jump suits with zippers. That's real heroic looking. This is one Superman I would not want to rescue me for fear of what he'll do to me for payment. And my exit door is an exit only door, if you know what I mean. So if you really want to know how this movie is: Read some of the other 1 star reviews. Or just blow a 5 second rasberry. And THAT'S how this movie is. I never thought it would be possible to make  Superman IV: The Quest For Peace seem so endearing and a joy to watch afterall. But this movie does just that. MY Superman wears Red and Blue not brown and turqoise. And My Superman fights a never ending battle for truth, justice, and the AMERICAN way. The fact they left ""American way"" out of this movie and no one protested really shows the cowardice and lack of pride we've had for this nation. Proud to be an American.

Certainly not but it is a good entertainment, even if the editing could have been slightly more dynamic at times. They have dared ressuscitate him, like the simple comic strip character he used to be. They suddenly remembered that he would not be the first one. Sherlock Holmes was ressuscitated by Conan Doyle. Aliens were ressuscitated for a fourth episode. Even Harry Potter will be ressuscitated in a few years by Ms Rowling after she has has him killed in billions of various sufferings and ordeals. They also say that Jesus started in a way the literary trick for the second episode of the Bible, the New Testament, which became a real bestseller since then. What's more, they're even preparing the next episode by grooming the next generation. Yes, indeed, Superman had left a child, a son, behind him when he left last time he was around. And the son promises : he kills a gangster by knocking him down with a grand, a very grand piano. The bad man, Luthor, is back too, just out of prison, not the man in black like with Stephen King, but a man in white to cultivate differences in a way. And he even finishes his carrier the same way as in `The Stand', though in this case there is no savage he can start preaching and manipulating on this desert island. It is really funny at times, and very emotional when our Superman manages to save a whole family in one single flight. Of course you may wonder if the world really needs a saviour, a new Jesus. Even if you are a Christian Born Again you may have doubts about it, especially if you see the mess some of them Christians Born Again create as soon as they open their mouths. Note the only emergency number they do not dial in this film is 911. We understand why since they try to destroy the whole city in one single attack. That would have been a little bit too simple. A good summer film for this hot season when we can go around without any shirt nor any pants on, at times even without any shoes.

This movie is yet an another example where superior special effects do not make up for inferior character development.What makes Superman super?Is he super because he can bend steel, fly faster than a plane, and run through walls? Would Superman be super if he had used his powers only for his personal gain?Superman, as the 1977 version so beautifully conveyed, brought hopes and dreams to youngsters during the Great Depression. Despite his powers, he is very human inside. He is capable of insecurity, anxiety, jealousy, love, and even hate. What sets him apart, however, is his willingness to do the right thing even when the tempation to do otherwise is great. He chooses to hide his powers and not use it for his personal gain. He chooses to sacrifice himself for humanity who often rejects him as an outcast. What makes Superman super is his unyielding moral character against all tribulations and temptations.The movie casts aside character development and relationships that make Superman story so compelling. Smallville, the TV version of Superman, is popular because it focuses on the trials and tribulations of becoming Superman. It also focuses on Superman's relationsips with his earth parents, his high school sweetheart and best friend, and his alien father Jarrell. This movie mostly fails to capture that magic.Lois Lane's character in this movie is too simple. This movie could have expounded the reasons why she loves Superman. Is it because he is such a good news story? Or is it because he has superpowers?Overall, this is a decent movie worth seeing.

1023470,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B000J10EQU,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[4, 7]","... which is very much how I feel about people who went to see this film expecting something straight out of the regular comics continuity(something more akin to BATMAN BEGINS), but unfortunately for them, this is in fact a continuation of the original Salkind/Spengler-produced series that, if we are to accept (and I happily do) to ignore the awful 3rd and 4th SUPERMAN films, and believe that the saga left off at the end of SUPERMAN II, the last film of that series that was truly a good film. This film pays homage, more than anything, to the work done by Richard Donner in the first two SUPERMAN films (That's right, I said the first TWO... because Donner was cut loose after filming approximately 70% of part 2) and the mythology of all of the screen incarnations, with Jack Larson (The old TV series' Jimmy Olsen) and Noel Neill (the serial's Lois Lane). That being said, this film is a joy to behold. It has heart and soul, some fantastic set pieces, and some of the most iconic imagery ever presented in a superhero film. Brandon Routh, coming in to fill the extremely large-sized boots of the late Christopher Reeve (who admittedly by pretty much everyone who ever either made or saw the previous films was born to play the dual role of Superman/Clark Kent) and he does an admirable job. He may look a little younger and a little slighter, but he does more in this film than just a Christopher Reeve impersonation (as he was essentially was accused of, which is a crock... the personae of Clark Kent/Superman was not created by Reeve, but merely perfected by him) and he does quite well. Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor... I was very excited by this prospect since Spacey is one of the great working actors in film and stage now, and seeing him in this film, it only made the film stronger. His Lex is a little darker, and not quite as tongue-in-cheek as Gene Hackman's portrayal in the previous films, and he works the role to Spacey-esque proportions. The only real failing of casting in this film is Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane, and it has nothing to do with her level of talent since she is quite a talented actress. It does really have to do with her age... she seems impossibly young to play the grizzled, world-renowned, Pulitzer-winning intrepid reporter and mother. Erica Durance, who plays a much younger Lois Lane on the television show ""Smallville"" seems older than Bosworth and more than anything, Bosworth's young looks are more distracting as to take her out of the role. A misfire of casting though hardly diminishes the narrative and emotion of the scenes she plays with Routh, Spacey and the EXTREMELY underrated James Marsden as her fiance. The real star of this film though is its director, Bryan Singer, who helped Marvel prove that Superhero films could not only make money but be good as well with his work on the first two X-MEN films, and now has proved to DC that he can make Superman work again. The film takes well-paced breaks from the action that instead of hurting the flow, assist in the emotional investment. Singer is a director who is not afraid to take his time when dealing with characters. This was the only ""blockbuster"" film of the last summer that really gave you something worth your money, including a last moment homage to Reeve's portrayal that tugs heavily at the heartstrings and really does make you believe that a man can fly.",5,"""They only lack the light to show the way.""",1160784000,"10 14, 2006",2006,3380,"['very', 'much', 'how', 'feel', 'people', 'who', 'went', 'see', 'film', 'expecting', 'something', 'straight', 'regular', 'comics', 'continuity', 'something', 'more', 'akin', 'BATMAN', 'BEGINS', 'unfortunately', 'fact', 'continuation', 'original', 'Salkind/Spengler-produced', 'series', 'are', 'accept', 'happily', 'do', 'ignore', 'awful', '3rd', '4th', 'SUPERMAN', 'films', 'believe', 'saga', 'left', 'off', 'end', 'SUPERMAN', 'II', 'last', 'film', 'series', 'was', 'truly', 'good', 'film', 'film', 'homage', 'more', 'anything', 'work', 'done', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'first', 'two', 'SUPERMAN', 'films', 'right', 'said', 'first', 'TWO', 'Donner', 'was', 'cut', 'loose', 'filming', 'approximately', '70', '%', 'part', '2', 'mythology', 'screen', 'incarnations', 'Jack', 'Larson', 'old', 'TV', 'series', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'Noel', 'Neill', 'serial', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'being', 'said', 'film', 'joy', 'behold', 'heart', 'soul', 'fantastic', 'set', 'pieces', 'most', 'iconic', 'imagery', 'ever', 'presented', 'superhero', 'film', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'coming', 'fill', 'extremely', 'large-sized', 'boots', 'late', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'who', 'admittedly', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'who', 'ever', 'either', 'made', 'saw', 'previous', 'films', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'dual', 'role', 'Superman/Clark', 'Kent', 'admirable', 'job', 'may', 'look', 'little', 'younger', 'little', 'slighter', 'more', 'film', 'just', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'impersonation', 'was', 'essentially', 'was', 'accused', 'crock', 'personae', 'Clark', 'Kent/Superman', 'was', 'not', 'created', 'Reeve', 'merely', 'perfected', 'quite', 'well', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'prospect', 'Spacey', 'one', 'great', 'working', 'actors', 'film', 'stage', 'now', 'seeing', 'film', 'only', 'made', 'film', 'stronger', 'Lex', 'little', 'darker', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'portrayal', 'previous', 'films', 'role', 'Spacey-esque', 'proportions', 'only', 'real', 'failing', 'casting', 'film', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'nothing', 'do', 'level', 'talent', 'quite', 'talented', 'actress', 'really', 'have', 'do', 'age', 'impossibly', 'young', 'play', 'grizzled', 'world-renowned', 'Pulitzer-winning', 'intrepid', 'reporter', 'mother', 'Erica', 'Durance', 'who', 'much', 'younger', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'television', 'show', 'Smallville', 'older', 'Bosworth', 'more', 'anything', 'Bosworth', 'young', 'looks', 'are', 'more', 'distracting', 'take', 'out', 'role', 'misfire', 'casting', 'hardly', 'narrative', 'emotion', 'scenes', 'Routh', 'Spacey', 'EXTREMELY', 'underrated', 'James', 'Marsden', 'fiance', 'real', 'star', 'film', 'though', 'director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'who', 'helped', 'Marvel', 'prove', 'Superhero', 'films', 'could', 'not', 'only', 'make', 'money', 'be', 'good', 'well', 'work', 'first', 'two', 'X-MEN', 'films', 'now', 'proved', 'DC', 'can', 'make', 'Superman', 'work', 'again', 'film', 'well-paced', 'breaks', 'action', 'instead', 'hurting', 'flow', 'assist', 'emotional', 'investment', 'Singer', 'director', 'who', 'not', 'afraid', 'take', 'time', 'when', 'dealing', 'characters', 'was', 'only', 'blockbuster', 'film', 'last', 'summer', 'really', 'gave', 'something', 'money', 'including', 'last', 'moment', 'homage', 'Reeve', 'portrayal', 'heavily', 'heartstrings', 'really', 'make', 'believe', 'man', 'can', 'fly']",N/A
1023471,ADVRSHBI35H97,B000J10EQU,"James Donovan ""movie lover""","[0, 0]","Enthralling and heartfelt, Superman Returns is possibly the first comic book superhero film where I actually cared about what happens to the characters. The film is full of razzle dazzle special effects and action sequences, to be sure, but it's rooted in old-fashioned morals and ideas that for a while didn't seem to be hip or relevant in today's film world.As much as I love the Batman and X-Men films, the heroes in those films tended to be angst-ridden and self-piteous.(The woe-is-me syndrome) It was a conceit that was wearing very thin, especially when carried over into other superhero films like Spiderman and the inexcusable Fantastic Four. The difference here is that while the Man Of Steel is all too aware of his being an outsider, he puts it aside to do a greater good. In other words, he gets over himself for the sake of what he loves and holds dear and has sworn to protect. Yes, he does feel put-upon at times, but his belief in the goodness of others overshadows any doubts he has about his place in the world.Now, on to the good stuff. The acting is first-rate. Brandon Routh, a virtual unknown, does the impossible and makes the character of Superman his own. The inevitable comparisons to Christopher Reeve aside, Routh makes you believe he IS Superman and his Clark Kent, while sadly underutilized, is warmly endearing. I was very impressed by him altogether. When I heard that Kate Bosworth was going to play Lois Lane, I was nervous. Not because of her acting abilities, but because of her extreme youth. On a normal day she could probably pass for a high-schooler. So I was very surprised by the depth and emotion she brought to the role, and was equally surprised that I completely bought it. She was terrific and had wonderful chemistry with Routh. James Marden is good if a bit bland, but Frank Langella as Perry White was amazing. It was also a treat to see the legendary Eva Marie Saint onscreen as Clark Kent's mother, although her sceen time was severly limited, a likely causalty of trimming the film down.On the villain side, Kevin Spacey brought a fun balance of camp and menace to Lex Luthor, but was overshadowed ever so slightly by the scene-stealing Parker Posey, as Lex's moll. She had some of the film's best lines and brought much humor to the sometimes dark proceedings.On that note, a word of warning to parents who might want to bring very young children to this. There a few scenes that might be too disturbing for kids, one during the early plane scene where passengers are literally being thrown around, and the other one towards the end where Superman is being beaten up by a bunch of Lex's thugs. It's not particularly violent, but it does come as a bit of a shock and there were many gasps from the audience when I went to see it. That's really the only complaint I can think of. I absolutely loved the film and highly recommend it, not just for the thrills but for the heart that was brought to a genre that too often forgets to include it.",5,Long Live The Man Of Steel!!,1152835200,"07 14, 2006",2006,2994,"['Enthralling', 'heartfelt', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'possibly', 'first', 'comic', 'book', 'superhero', 'film', 'where', 'actually', 'cared', 'what', 'characters', 'film', 'full', 'razzle', 'dazzle', 'special', 'effects', 'action', 'sequences', 'be', 'sure', 'rooted', 'old-fashioned', 'morals', 'ideas', 'while', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'hip', 'relevant', 'today', 'film', 'world.As', 'much', 'love', 'Batman', 'X-Men', 'films', 'heroes', 'films', 'tended', 'be', 'angst-ridden', 'self-piteous', 'woe-is-me', 'syndrome', 'was', 'conceit', 'was', 'wearing', 'very', 'thin', 'especially', 'when', 'carried', 'other', 'superhero', 'films', 'Spiderman', 'inexcusable', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'difference', 'here', 'Man', 'Steel', 'too', 'aware', 'being', 'outsider', 'aside', 'do', 'greater', 'good', 'other', 'words', 'over', 'sake', 'what', 'dear', 'sworn', 'protect', 'Yes', 'feel', 'put-upon', 'times', 'belief', 'goodness', 'others', 'overshadows', 'doubts', 'place', 'world.Now', 'good', 'stuff', 'acting', 'first-rate', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'virtual', 'unknown', 'impossible', 'character', 'Superman', 'own', 'inevitable', 'comparisons', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'aside', 'Routh', 'believe', 'Superman', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'sadly', 'underutilized', 'warmly', 'endearing', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'altogether', 'When', 'heard', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'was', 'going', 'play', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'was', 'nervous', 'Not', 'acting', 'abilities', 'extreme', 'youth', 'normal', 'day', 'could', 'probably', 'pass', 'high-schooler', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'depth', 'emotion', 'brought', 'role', 'was', 'equally', 'surprised', 'completely', 'bought', 'was', 'terrific', 'had', 'wonderful', 'chemistry', 'Routh', 'James', 'Marden', 'good', 'bit', 'bland', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'Perry', 'White', 'was', 'amazing', 'was', 'also', 'treat', 'see', 'legendary', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'onscreen', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'mother', 'sceen', 'time', 'was', 'severly', 'limited', 'likely', 'causalty', 'trimming', 'film', 'villain', 'side', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'brought', 'fun', 'balance', 'camp', 'menace', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'was', 'overshadowed', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'scene-stealing', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'Lex', 'moll', 'had', 'film', 'best', 'lines', 'brought', 'much', 'humor', 'sometimes', 'dark', 'proceedings.On', 'note', 'word', 'warning', 'parents', 'who', 'might', 'want', 'bring', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'few', 'scenes', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'disturbing', 'kids', 'one', 'early', 'plane', 'scene', 'where', 'passengers', 'are', 'literally', 'being', 'thrown', 'other', 'one', 'end', 'where', 'Superman', 'being', 'beaten', 'up', 'bunch', 'Lex', 'thugs', 'not', 'particularly', 'violent', 'come', 'bit', 'shock', 'were', 'many', 'gasps', 'audience', 'when', 'went', 'see', 'really', 'only', 'complaint', 'can', 'think', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'not', 'just', 'thrills', 'heart', 'was', 'brought', 'genre', 'too', 'often', 'include']",N/A

It was funny, the visual effects have been much improved since the last Superman releases, the acting was very impressive, and the story has been moved forward in a way that fans have been begging for a very long time.But for a Superman movie there was a lot of talk, talk, talk, talk, talk... while leaving everybody waiting for the next bit of action.  The action does come, but in small little pieces that leave you wishing for more.  This movie does not give Superman the screentime to really show off his powers.I was also irked by some of the changes.  For instance, the phrase, ""life, liberty, and all that stuff?""  What, is the American Way not good enough anymore?  And some of the comparisons between Superman and Jesus Christ were a little unsettling.  Christ is the founder of one of the largest religions on this planet, DC shouldn't be getting such an ego comparing their comic book character to him.I got the High Definition edition of Superman and was very disappointed.

1023473,A2HRT3AZA2YCDP,B000J10EQU,James E Geoffrey II,"[16, 20]","The Man of Steel was gone for over twenty years and he came back a grown-up.  That is the genius of Bryan Singer's Superman Returns, a film that both stands on its own merits and still manages to evoke the splendor of the Superman movies of the late 1970's.  The heart pounding special effects and super heroics are all here, but now they come packaged in a story replete with symbolism and a level of emotional depth that is not normally to be found in a summer blockbuster super hero movie.Make no mistake, this is not your father's Superman.  The Man of Steel, played by the able newcomer Bandon Routh, returns to Earth after having spent five years exploring the remnants of his dead home planet, Krypton.  Things have changed in the last five years though. The old crew is still there, with Ma Kent (Eva Marie Saint) looking after the farm in Smallville, Perry White (Frank Langella) editing the Daily Planet and Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) snapping photos of Metropolis' favorite hero.However, you can never go home again, and the Last Son of Kyrpton is shaken to find that the love of his life, Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), is an unwed mother of son, Jason, (Tristan Lake Leabu) with a live in boyfriend, Perry White's nephew, Richard (James Marsden).  Perhaps the only thing that has remained totally consistent is Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) who, having stolen Kryptonian technology from Superman's Fortress of Solitude, is planning to use it to create a whole new continent on Earth and sink the United States beneath the waves.The action scenes in Superman Returns are suitably impressive.  If the tag line to the original 1978 movie was ""You'll believe that a man can fly,"" the 2006 version should be, ""Now you'll really believe that a man can fly!""  The sequences are memorable, and one in particular, where Superman saves an airliner that is about to crash, will almost certainly have the audience out of their seats and cheering.However, the action is almost secondary.  Superman Returns is really noteworthy for its surprisingly complex emotions and symbolism.  Superman is still the square jawed hero, almost impossibly noble and virtuous.  However, he is also a deeply sad figure, lonely and denied his heart's desire by the call of duty to a world whose agony he can literally hear. He is, as his Kryptonian father Jor-El (Marlon Brando) tells him, ""Raised among them but not one of them,"" and for all his mighty powers Superman is denied the simple pleasures of wife, family and ordinary human companionship.In this, by the way, Superman compares more than favorably to his Marvel Comics hero counterpart, Spiderman, who whines incessantly about the burdens of his powers and who does not hesitate to steel the girl from an honorable man. Superman bears his pain quietly and, though tempted, does not use his powers to take from ordinary men whom he could easily brush aside.  That nobility, with its overtones of Christian sacrifice, the screenwriters and Singer brilliantly capture in both dialogue and in splendid visual symbols.The acting in Superman Returns has not been compared favorably to the original Christopher Reeve movies, but this is mistaken.  Unlike the legendary Reeve, whose Superman was 100% the square jawed hero with a touch of irony, Brandon Routh plays Superman with far greater emotional depth.  This is the man behind the hero, powerful and noble, but also emotionally vulnerable, lonely, and even at times a bit frightened.  Similarly, kudos go to Routh for his portrayal of Clark Kent.  Somehow, in the 1978 movie, ""mild-mannered reporter"" got translated into ""three-footed dufus."" This was a ridiculous approach, and Routh here rights that imbalance, giving the viewer a much more believable Kent.Kate Bosworth's Lois Lane also surpasses Margot Kidder's shrill characterization.  Bosworth portrays Lois by turns as a loving mother and a tough career woman who, just beneath the surface, carries a bitter but conflicted resentment toward the hero who left her behind without saying good-bye.  Bosworth plays this shrewdly.  The anger and resentment are not just dumped out on the screen for the viewer to see, but rather seeps out in bits and pieces here and there.  Moreover, like the man that she truly still loves, she does not forsake another good man just to have the hero.  These are adults, they have made choices, and they live with the consequences.The other actors handle their parts with equal effectiveness and commendable skill.  Spacey's Luthor is not the clownish figure of Gene Hackman's 1978 portrayal, but is a genius with an almost frightening sadistic streak.  He was imprisoned for five years and he wants revenge.  There is humor, but there is also a chilling streak of pure evil. Langella's Perry White is not some boor bellowing in a newsroom, but is a cool professional who takes care of his people and his paper.  Sam Huntington's Jimmy Olsen is a likeable and very human person whose friendship for Clark is both boyishly endearing and deeply genuine.  Parker Posey is properly entertaining, and the presence of Noel Neill and Jack Larson is a nice touch.James Marsden also deserves special credit.  The character of Richard White is an especially tough one because it is easy to dislike him for standing in the way of the Lois - Superman relationship.  Yet Marsden shines in the part.  His Richard White is haunted by the possibility that the family he truly and deeply loves will be carried off by a god-like guy in a cape.  Yet he perseveres and becomes in a way the unsung hero of the film. He risks more than Superman because he has more to lose. Yet he saves Superman even when he knows that doing so may cost him what he loves most.Superman Returns is a surprisingly rich and complex movie, yet it manages to retain all the excitement of the typical summer blockbuster.  Superman's returned, and it's good to have him back.",5,A Grown-up Man of Steel,1156896000,"08 30, 2006",2006,5902,"['Man', 'Steel', 'was', 'gone', 'twenty', 'years', 'came', 'back', 'grown-up',

He was heard on radio and seen in comic books.  In 1941, a brief cartoon of Superman was shown in the movie theaters with the voice of Bud Collyer as ""Superman"".Kirk Alyn made his appearance as ""Superman"" in 1948 with Noel Neill as ""Lois Lane"".Superman returned again in the form of George Reeves as Clark Kent/Superman in ""Adventures of Superman"" (1952-58).  Noel Neill returned as ""Lois Lane"" and Jack Larson began as ""Jimmy Olsen"".  George Reeves was growing tired of playing ""Superman"" and was upset that he would be typecast.  He committed suicide, June 16 1959.  This was dramatized in the motion picture, Hollywoodland (2006).The most poignant motion picture of ""Superman"" came in 1978 with Christopher Reeve (no relation to George) in the title role.  He had been an actor on the soap opera ""Love of Life"".Superman was a super-hit with Christopher Reeve and three more movies were made, Superman II (1980), Superman III (1983), Superman IV: The Quest For Peace (1987).  Supergirl was made in 1984.In 1995, Christopher Reeve was in a debilitating horse-riding accident that left him paralyzed from the neck-down. He needed the assistance of a breathing-machine so he could breathe.  With improvement, he was able to act again wheel-chair bound and even appeared in a couple ""Smallville"" tv-episodes.  Reeve died October 10, 2004.On August 14, 2004, Brandon Routh was told he was the new ""Superman"". He used to appear on soap operas, One Life To Live (2001-02), Port Charles (2001-02), General Hospital (2002-03).Superman has been away for 5 years to find out the truth about his birth planet, Krypton.He arrives back to Earth in the same way he arrived as a toddler.  His Earth-mother, Martha (Eva Marie Saint) comforts him on his return.  With his old job back as ""Clark Kent"" at the Daily Planet, he discovers that Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) was freed from prison because Superman wasn't around to testify.  Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) is now married to ""Richard White"" (James Marsden), her boss Perry White's (Frank Langella) nephew.  They have a young son.Also in the cast: Sam Huntington, Kal Penn, Kitty Kowalski.Noel Neill makes an appearance as Lex Luthor's mother.  Jack Larson appears as a bartender.The late Marlon Brando (Superman, Superman II) appears by the use of unseen archive footage.Note: Brandon Routh actually has brown eyes.

ROUTH is very appealing and has the look of our hero.  all the others:  LANGELLA, BOSWORTH and SPACEY are well cast.  story: new continent made from crystals and kryptonite with LUTHOR owning the new land and SUPERMAN returns from searching for planet KRYPTON.  STARTLING state of the art special effects(basically the plane sequence)--the rest are ok and you can tell the minatures in many of the scenes.  ROUTH showed his emotions well with likeable subtle nuances.  the length of the movie is a whopping 2hrs and 34 mins.  I love getting more bang/movie for the dollar but longer is not always better--they could have shaved a few mins here and there.  really nice interplay between lois and clark/SUPERMAN and it does make you like them even more.  LANGELLA and SPACEY do their best(SPACEY alittle more) in roles but I would have liked LUTHOR be aweebit more evil.  for some reason I really enjoyed SAM HUNTINGTON as JIMMY OLSON(his giddy innocence) and EVA MARIE SAINT as MARTHA KENT(his caring mum)---their roles were not significant, however-memorable at least to me.  you could tell alot from their role playing that they captured the essence of who they were.  lois has a child?-----is it with her husband or with SUPERMAN the twist is nice and you do wonder at times.  so, with all things said:  GOOD SHOW - go see it at IMAX theatre in your area.  this was a very good movie and all fans should go right out and see it.

1023478,A31IFLAAZO672R,B000J10EQU,Jay J. Banks,"[10, 14]","It has been a long time since I've posted a film review online. I consider myself to be a film connoisseur even if my experience is limited to genre type pictures. The purpose of this review is to persuade you all to go see Superman Returns. It is one of the best films ever made (do not chew me out yet because this is only my personal opinion.) It was directed by Mr. Bryan Singer and stars Kevin Spacey, Kate Bosworth, James Marsden and newcomer Brandon Routh as the Man of Steel. It is as faithful to both the comics and Richard Donner's interpretation as you can get. It feels like a remake but it never manages to insult our intelligence and say it is, which is what I believe is the problem with other remakes of today.Routh as Superman. It was almost as if someone had reincarnated the late great Christopher Reeve. Routh had every little nuance, gesture, facial tic down to a tee. Also, the resemblance is uncanny. But resemblance is not enough; he brings to mind Reeve's iconic portrayal and also manages to make the role his own with small subtleties. Just like Christian Bale reinvented the Batman, Routh has brought us back the Last Son of Krypton while paying homage to the man who we all remember as the definitive version of the same role. I do not know if homage is a strong enough word for how Routh and Singer have honored Christopher and Dana Reeve. I know wherever they are, they are smiling.Superman in a new contemporary society. The world does not seem to have moved on much since his departure. There is still crime, despair, and poverty, so the world still needs a Superman. The only little inconsistency with this world is that Donner's original film takes place in the 70s and this film is obviously set in the 21st century. So that means either Donner's films will have to be retconned to have taken place in the not too distant future or, you know what? It really doesn't matter.Superman and Lois Lane's relationship. This is what carries the film and it does so effectively without being cheesy or contrived. It is an age old dilemma. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, boy disappears, girl moves on with her life but boy is still in love with her. Also, there is a unique plot twist that will totally blow you away and if you listen to internet spoilers, it may sound lame and campy. But Singer's direction and the way it is presented are so effective, you come out of the theatre satisfied.Spacey as Luthor. Now this performance seemed scary at first in the context that it looked as if Spacey was trying to copy Gene Hackman but he does not. This is Lex Luthor with the volume turned way up and it does not come off as over the top or campy. You really hate this guy and you wait in desperation for Superman to get his hands on him. His nefarious plot, while reminiscent of the 1978 original, is one of which only a Lex Luthor can think of.Ebert and the Hollywood System. Roger Ebert didn't like it. You know what? Screw Roger Ebert. For over 30 years the world has had this man's biased opinion shoved down our throats and I am sick to my stomach of it. How is he an authority on movies and has never made one? How can he tell Russell Crowe or Sharon Stone how to act when he has never been behind a camera? What makes his opinion the only one that matters? Jesus Christ! They act like he's God Almighty or something. See this film for what it is and not because of no talent hacks like Ebert telling you otherwise.Superman has had a rough road trying to get back on the silver screen since that 1987 flop, The Quest For Peace. It seems everyone that was attached to the project at one point or another wanted to reinvent Superman as a martial arts action hero weirdo like Van Damme or Seagal. You should read online some of the crappy ideas they had for a potential Superman film, everything from Matrix rip off fights to battles with giant spiders. Finally, here comes Singer who recognizes that such changes are unwarranted and that you have to keep the character true to the original stories and not some contemporary merchandise-sales-only-matter pop culture MTV machine (remember Batman & Robin).Singer's direction and the Musical Score. From the moment the Warner Brothers shield appeared to the end credits, I knew I was watching a Superman film. Aesthetically and artistically, the film seemed like Donner and Reeve were back together again in an all new completely original Superman story. Singer seems to have found his niche with this particular type of genre. I know in Hollywood, these type of movies do not get much respect because they are looked upon as too commercial and that they are for kids, but they are wrong. If they would look past the secret identities and corny getups, they would see the depth that pictures bring to the American cultural landscape. It is not about having super powers and saving the world, it is about holding true to your own personal principles and using supernatural means, even if they do not exist, to do so. Men like Sam Raimi, Christopher Nolan, and Bryan Singer seem to understand this and I hope they continue to put these masterpieces on the screen in the years to come.The main themes are borrowed from the great John Williams but the original themes make it seem like Williams was right there with John Ottman, who has composed a score that makes us once again believe a man can fly.The Final analysis. Along with X-Men: The Last Stand, this one of the few movies worth watching this year. Not because of the special effects but because of the depth of the characterizations and the lengths to which the filmmakers have gone to present us not only a great comic book adaptation, but also a great film. So I highly recommend Superman Returns to both the fanboys and the general move going audience. If Batman Begins is the best superhero adaptation to date, then Superman Returns is the second best. Side note: I know this may sound like an attempt for both franchises to be more pop friendly and fanboy pleasing, but I think Christopher Nolan and Bryan Singer need to start talking with one another. I know I don't have to say about what.",5,A Review of Superman Returns,1151539200,"06 29, 2006",2006,6132,"['been', 'long', 'time', ""'ve"", 'posted', 'film', 'review', 'online', 'consider', 'be',

When I heard they were going to make another one, I was excited but at the same time, I could not imagine anyone else but Christopher Reeves playing the title role.  Yet, I was curious and my friends wanted to see it was well, so we all went ahead and saw it.  I want my money back!This movie is a joke.  The plot is weak and the role of Superman is out of character.  There are siuations that Superman is in which he, the actor, acts and does things totally out of the character of Superman.Lex Luther, played by Kevin Spacey, is a joke as well.  The simple truth is he simply is not believeable.  He does not act ruthless, nor does he seem to have a true hated for Superman.  He shows he would like to destroy him, but not with the zest that Gene Hackman showed.  In the original, it was clear that Lex Luther wanted to kill SupermanIn the final analysis, it's obvious that this plot really does not make much sense at all.  A lot of things are not explained and there is no real climax.  If you are a Superman fan, I'd strongly recommend seeing the first two installments made back in 1978 and 1980.  And for you die hard Superman fans, you may be interested to know that Warner brothers is going to release a special edition of the fist 4 film when this one is released.  They are also going to release Richard Donner's version of Superman 2 which never has been released.  Donner was fired when the film was almost complete and the producers hired Richard Lester to take over and basically remake the movie.  It is rumoured that Donner's version of Superman 2 is far better than the one released.

1023485,A2BC978GQQEA2A,B000J10EQU,Jeffrey Pidgeon,"[2, 8]","""Superman Returns"", written by Michael Dougherty & Dan Harris; directed by Bryan Singer.A long time ago, two Jewish boys from New York created an immortal figure in pop mythology, who has come to define the genre - the very state - of being a superhero.  But maybe that's a little too far back.About thirty years ago, a team of filmmakers decided once again to tell that story - the tale of Superman, ""strange visitor from another planet, with powers far beyond that of mortal men"".  I saw ""Superman - The Movie"" when I was thirteen, and was delighted.  Like many of my favorite movies, ""Superman"" was everything I wanted it to be, and some things that I didn't even know I wanted yet.""Superman"" was also one of the first superhero comics that I read, and I responded strongly to the story's iconic qualities.  The first film (not counting the movie serials) preserved and expanded on those  elements.  In the forty years since his creation, Superman had gone from being an American icon to a world citizen, the 1978 movie ending with him soaring high above the earth.Which brings me to last Friday,  when I saw the latest version of the orphan son from the planet Krypton.Here, Superman's role has expanded yet again, this time to the scale of a Christ figure.  I suppose the parallels could always have been made, and here Mr. Singer and his writers don't hold back.  When his spacecraft again plummets down to the Kent family farm, Martha draws Kal-El from the wreck in a tableau meant to evoke Michelangelo's Pieta.  The film is rife with comments and images meant to evoke a divine quality - Luthor calls Superman a selfish god and later stabs him in the side; some of the flying stances mimic the crucifixion; and so on.It's a natural connection to make - a powerful son from the heavens is sent to lead, rescue and inspire us - but even taking Superman's considerable iconography into account, it's a rather outsized and unwieldly one.  I'm assuming that Mr. Singer intended it to give shading and dimension to the story, but instead it cloaks the proceedings in a veil of gloom.Superman represents something very specific to me, and while Mr. Donner's film captured it, I think Mr. Singer's misses the mark.  Superman is a product of the '30s - a figure of unabashed optimism emerging from the shadow of the Great Depression; the friendly, dependable policeman on everybody's block.  While I'm sure there was corruption then as now, Superman at that time represented the best that Americans could hope to be - powerful and just.  He was the other, the immigrant, but he was a part of us, too.  Christopher Reeve's goofy charm managed to make that very squareness sincerely work through its own merits.  In the current version, we're treated to the type of grey brooding, weighty symbolism, and life trade-offs better suited for Spider-Man or Batman.  But for me, Superman's never been that sort of hero.It's difficult for me to believe that he'd be so fixated on his past that he'd so thoroughly neglect his present as he does in this film, abandoning his adopted world and his true love to discover what we knew all along - Krypton was destroyed and he is the only survivor.  There's not much to motivate this, except that his home planet's former location was determined.Naturally, Lois (Kate Bosworth) is heartbroken, and while he's gone (it takes five years to get there and back, though it's not clear to me why Superman needs a spaceship at all) she moves on, marrying a clear surrogate (he's even a pilot, for goodness' sake).  She's written her article on ""Why We Don't Need Superman"", winning a Pulitzer in the process, and had a child.  This is what Superman (Brandon Routh, an eerie echo of Reeve's performance) returns to - while most of the world gleefully rejoices, Lois wants little to do with him.So mighty Kal-El, for all his fame and power, becomes a mopey ex-boyfriend.  When he's not involved in heroics, he's hovering over Lois' home, peering inside with his X-ray vision.  It's sympathetic for an ordinary guy, but it's more than a little creepy coming from an omnipotent super-being.Fortunately, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is at large, and once again up to mischief.  This is all Superman's fault, since he didn't show up to a hearing (again, why not hold off the Krypton trip until the guy who tried to detonate two nuclear warheads and drop California into the ocean is behind bars?).  Luthor high-tails it back to the Fortress of Solitude and steals all of the crystals that educated Superman on his maiden voyage to Earth.  It turns out that they're capable of far more than we realized (but, assuming that Superman knew that, left them unprotected for quite a while), and Luthor builds a far larger version of his previous plan.These parallel threads weave on throughout the story, but not before one more big surprise is unveiled.  The origin of this twist is extremely murky, and its emotional payoff somewhat limited, raising more questions than anything else.The Christ parable abruptly stops when the story requires a larger sacrifice to be made.  Superman has already lost Lois with no way to truly reunite with her; and the hero of the biggest tentpole picture of the summer can hardly be killed.  Lois changes her tune and decides 'we' need him after all, but since there's so little chemistry between them, it hardly means much.  The plot, Luthor notwithstanding, basically ends in a romantic stalemate.This is not to say that the film doesn't have its pleasures.  Most of the cast is fine, with Routh and Bozworth at least dispelling my concerns about baby-faced reporters.  The only true squandering is Parker Posey's moll - she's neither daffy sex-doll nor snappy spitfire, so it's hard to see why Luthor keeps her around.  The special effects are naturally on a grand scale, the technical portrayal of Superman is especially vivid, convincing and impressive.The Richard Donner ""Superman"" was a huge inspiration for the director, and it clearly shows.  Much of the film - from the acting styles of the cast, the faux-slit-scan credit sequence, the savvy blending of the retro-Daily Planet/Smallville/Americana/Clark Kent garb in a contemporary setting, the return of the John Williams score, right down to the labeling of a Kryptonite meteor - labors mightily to revive the feelings that many of us had in 1978.  Yet as a whole, the grafts don't take, not really. Mainly because, at its heart, it's not much like that film at all.""Superman - The Movie"" made me wish I was Superman.

1023486,ATS1HA5M3EPZ4,B000J10EQU,"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile""","[6, 8]","Being shelved, fought over, re-written and passed on by three CEOs, over 20 producers and countless writers, the wait was finally over when Brian Singer decided to take the reins on rebooting the Superman franchise.  The only person to survive the whole process was Jon `former hairstylist to Barbara Streisand-the movie must have a giant spider' Peters, whose heavy handed and outlandish approach to the character was probably one of the main reasons the movie never got made in the 90s.  Look him up, check out Kevin Smith's `An Evening With...' and you'll understand what I mean.  He represents the worst of Hollywood's worst producers who think they know what people want in doing massive re-imaging of classic characters.  He would make remake John Wayne into a Lawyer and Marilyn Monroe into `Barb Wire' if he had his way.But I digress.  His name is most likely on this movie simply because he has been involved from the beginning.  Thankfully Brian Singer, who proved his worth with the first two X-Men films, brings high end quality to the film and the story.Five years have past since the story of Superman 2 (Superman 3 & 4 thankfully have been graciously and shamelessly ignored/forgotten) and the Man of Steel returns to Earth after searching for remains of his home world.  At his return he find things have moved forward without him.  Not all in a good way either.  He finds the world has changed quite a bit, most due to 9/11 as he flips through channels and sees the news reports.  He also finds that Lois has moved on, having a child and a fianc&eacute;.  This lends to a great human element of Superman; did he ever think about how the people of Earth would move on while he was gone?  Did it occur to him that Lois wouldn't wait forever?  The humanistic aspect of this discovery lends to good dramatic elements.  Superman doesn't give up so easily on Lois and she obviously still harbors feelings for him.  Although she's deeply ticked at him for leaving without saying goodbye, so she keeps her distance.On the other side of the coin, Lex Luthor is released from prison, ironically because of Superman not showing up for the Appeals hearing.  He immediately begins planning his next scheme.  Kevin Spacey is on the money as Lex, giving an efficient performance.  Lex is determined to be the mastermind he is and he doesn't waste time talking about out loud or gloating when he could be furthering his goals.  He is intelligent, vicious and surprisingly likable.To further comment on the casting, I have to say I have mixed feeling about Brandon Routh.  Generally I think he's excellent.  He plays both sides of the character as well as Christopher Reeve did.  As Clark Kent his goofy antics to cover suspicion are actually even more subtle and more endearing.  As Superman, he's a little less convincing.  He doesn't have the presence that Christopher Reeve did, but you want so much to believe he is Superman that any doubts you have are just washed away with his likeability.  His Midwestern values ooze from his persona, just like Reeve.  The few doubts I have may be there only because that was the Superman I grew up with.  Newcomers won't make those comparisons.  Even so, no one can deny that Reeve had a greater physical presence and his eyes had a piercing quality that just can't be duplicated.  I was more impressed with Kate Bosworth.  Going in, I knew nothing about her, but once I first saw her on the screen I wasn't impressed.  But as the movie went on, I realized she had the grit and venom spitting down.  She was a tough woman reporter who had been scorned, and despite her finding love again with someone else, the moment Superman shows up, she kicks up the venom spewing a notch.  By the end, you're opinions of her have changed, but she really hasn't.  She (Lois) is still a bit bitchy and not totally over the whole being scorned thing.  However, Kate is a bit young to have gone through everything they talked about AND have a kid AND be as world weary as she is.  These are all just nit picks though, I still enjoyed watching them both.  Routh and Bosworth have good chemistry, which is important considering the chemistry between Reeve and Margot Kidder was so great.The plot line is not too far off from the first, but still original.  There is no doubt that so many aspects of the movie are an homage to the Richard Donner/Christopher Reeve films made over twenty five years ago.  Singer throws in just enough of the back story of those films to continue on here.  Composer John Ottman certainly ignores his own pride and integrates the popular John Williams theme into his own score, stitching together the past movies with this one even more.The action scenes are great in this one although I would have loved to have seen more super-feats (rescues, stopping criminals, etc.), there was an entire montage of those in the first movie and with so many similarities why not do that too.  There is a great shot that is a tribute to Action Comics #1 where he is putting the car on the ground.  Fans will see it.  Overall it was an incredible movie with great heart and soul being used to revive one of the worlds greatest heroes.

1023488,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000J10EQU,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[4, 7]","I was able to see this film over the holiday weekend. I've noticed a lot of people were hungry for this film to come out and ended up somewhat satisfied with the product.  ""Superman Returns"" is a competent movie, generally very well produced, directed and cast. But it didn't quite gel for me. I thought it dragged at points, as Superman got bogged down with pining over Lois Lane instead of saving the day. I thought the dialogue just wasn't sharp enough to sustain these heavy-handed emotional scenes; what sort of catchphrase is ""I'm always around,"" anyway?Here's what I did enjoy. The flight scenes were beautiful; Superman cut a very majestic figure as he soared across skylines and stars capes. The set design was great, too, creating a modern feel with hints of the Art Deco style I associate with Superman. And I appreciated the performances of Spacey, Bosworth and Langella. Routh had a curiously small role, especially as Clark Kent, so I had trouble judging whether he was wooden or actually good at playing a modest hero.Here's what I enjoyed less. Luthor's plan simply didn't interest me. I found the whole notion of growing a giant crystal island very surreal and not too threatening. Also, he poses a fairly boring threat to Superman. If Luthor's got Kryptonite, Superman is helpless; if he hasn't got Kryptonite, he's helpless. These two legendary antagonists can never really meet on equal terms. Thus, most confrontations between them must inevitably be one-sided.I also had a mixed reaction to the CGI effects. Some were wonderful, and others looked artificial despite being very detailed. I so very much wanted to love this film but sometime Hollywood studios have a way of systematically destroying every decent franchise they get their hands on. In spite of my mix emotions of the movie, it's far from being horrible.

Brandon Routh is under appreciated in my opinion, both as Clark Kent and as Superman.

1023490,A3EAI032S3EBBK,B000J10EQU,"Jerry Parks ""USAToday All-American Teacher; N...","[4, 7]","Since others can do a much better job relating the story, I will give my take on the film only from a singular perspective--the Christian messianic take on Superman as 'savior'.First off, I enjoyed the movie. As one who remembers the original Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen from the TV series, it was nice to see them again in cameo roles.The special effects rock--literally. The quakes, shakes, (near) crashes will pound you, and these were well-done. I will not discuss the plot involving Lois, Clark, Lois's husband and son, etc. Other reviewers can do that. But suffice it to say, this is a great story.The film--over 2.5 hours long--is two movies. The first half is the typical (and nicely done) Superman fare. Unlike many, I did not feel the opening sequences lagged. They tied up loose ends, provided retrospection and the acting (all the way through) was great.My only disappointment was the made-to-happen `bonding' between Lois's husband and Clark Kent. Not disappointing because it happened, but because it didn't. It came close at times, but never really materialized. What a shame.The second half of the film was Messianic--to the point of going `over the top' in some instances. This is not a complaint. It would be hard to believe however, that all of this was unintentional. Even the names of the main characters contain the moniker 'El', which is a Hebraism for 'God'. Initially, like Christ, Superman comes to the world unrecognized, unappreciated, and rejected (Lois's ""Why the World Doesn't Need Superman"" wins a Pulitzer Prize).In short, there are crystals (belonging to the destroyed world of Superman's father), which are stolen by the villain Lex Luther. He seeks to create his own 'world' by propagating these crystals in the sea, but he underestimates the proclivity with which the crystals grow. These ever-growing masses even fuse with the kryptonite Luther uses to encase them as they are 'planted'.Superman must save the world from the rapidly growing crystals. But to do so, he must succumb to the power of the deadly kryptonite. He must face the enemy in order to defeat it. In short, we see the hero suffering, dying, departing to the 'underworld', rising from the dead in glory, and finally ascending into the heavens. The messianic overtones (or undertones) are as obvious as the twice-repeated ""...the father becomes the son; the son becomes the father"", and the father's words ""They (humanity) only need the light to guide them. I sent you, my only son."". Christ, of course, is the 'Light of the world'. One can hardly miss the father to son: ""...you will never be alone"", much as Christ claimed co-eternity with His Father.For those seeking theology in the film, it is not easy to miss the crystals as 'sin'. As Satan perverted that which was meant for good from the Father's world, so Luther steals the crystals. Both the crystals and Satan's deception in Eden involve that which was to make one 'wise'. Too, as evil lurked in that first garden with Adam and Eve, and confronted Christ in Gethsemane, His garden place of solitude, so the evil Lex Luther stole the crystals from Superman's place of solitude.The prevalence and permeation of sin in the world is the pictured in the crystals' growth which becomes virtually out of control. And embedded within is the deadly kryptonite--the sting of sin--death. Superman, in seeking to be the savior, is seemingly defeated by Luther (Satan) and the cruel mistreatment at the villain's hand is reminiscent of Christ's torture by the Romans, and in a similar vein, the torture of Aslan by the White Witch in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.At last, Superman is stabbed by Luther with one of the deadly crystals, and, like Christ, ""tastes the sting of death and sin"", though He is innocent. There is a descent into the deep 'abyss' of the sea, (although this is not the final death scene) reminding one of Christ's descent into the belly of the earth. But Superman will eventually return and rid the planet of this evil by lifting the entire thorny-appearing, dark  crystal 'world' skyward (Christ being `lifted up' and bearing the sin of the world), and separating it forever from the earth he loves.In the end, the empty hospital room where Superman dies screams 'empty tomb!'. Like Christ, even his clothing lies neatly folded beside him. But the hero gloriously ascends from death into the clouds after reminding those who would miss him: ""I'm always around"", much as Christ's ""I am with you always"".I won't give away the scenes and plot twists that made this film enjoyable, but it's impossible to miss the messianic overtones.",4,"""Superman: A Messianic, Christian Perspective""",1151452800,"06 28, 2006",2006,4615,"['others', 'can', 'do', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'relating', 'story', 'will', 'give', 'take', 'film', 'only', 'singular', 'perspective', 'Christian', 'messianic', 'take', 'Superman', ""'savior'.First"", 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'one', 'who', 'original', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'again', 'cameo', 'roles.The', 'special', 'effects', 'rock', 'literally', 'quakes', 'shakes', 'crashes', 'will', 'pound', 'were', 'well-done', 'will', 'not', 'discuss', 'plot', 'involving', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'Lois', 'husband', 'son', 'etc', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'can', 'do', 'say', 'great', 'story.The', 'film', '2.5', 'hours', 'long', 'two', 'movies', 'first', 'half', 'typical', 'nicely', 'done', 'Superman', 'fare', 'many', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'opening', 'sequences', 'lagged', 'tied', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'provided', 'retrospection', 'acting', 'way', 'was', 'great.My', 'only', 'disappointment', 'was', 'made-to-happen', 'bonding', 'Lois', 'husband', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Not', 'disappointing', 'happened', 'did', ""n't"", 'came', 'close', 'times', 'never', 'really', 'materialized', 'What', 'shame.The', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'was', 'Messianic', 'point', 'going', 'top', ""'"", 'instances', 'not', 'complaint', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'believe', 'however', 'was', 'unintentional', 'Even', 'names', 'main', 'characters', 'contain', 'moniker', ""'El"", 'Hebraism', ""'God"", 'Initially', 'Christ', 'Superman', 'world', 'unrecognized', 'unappreciated', 'rejected', 'Lois', 'Why', 'World', 'Does', ""n't"", 'Need', 'Superman', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', '.In', 'short', 'are', 'crystals', 'belonging', 'destroyed', 'world', 'Superman', 'father', 'are', 'stolen', 'villain', 'Lex', 'Luther', 'create', 'own', ""'world"", 'propagating', 'crystals', 'sea', 'proclivity', 'crystals', 'grow', 'ever-growing', 'masses', 'even', 'fuse', 'kryptonite', 'Luther', 'encase', 'are', ""'planted'.Superman"", 'must', 'save', 'world', 'rapidly', 'growing', 'crystals', 'do', 'so', 'must', 'succumb', 'power', 'deadly', 'kryptonite', 'must', 'face', 'enemy', 'order', 'defeat', 'short', 'see', 'hero', 'suffering', 'dying', 'departing', ""'underworld"", 'rising', 'dead', 'glory', 'finally', 'ascending', 'heavens', 'messianic', 'overtones', 'undertones', 'are', 'as', 'obvious', 'twice-repeated', 'father', 'son', 'son', 'father', 'father', 'words', 'humanity', 'only', 'need', 'light', 'guide', 'sent', 'only', 'son.', 'Christ', 'course', ""'Light"", 'world', 'One', 'can', 'hardly', 'miss', 'father', 'son', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'alone', 'much', 'Christ', 'claimed', 'co-eternity', 'Father.For', 'seeking', 'theology', 'film', 'not', 'easy', 'miss', 'crystals', ""'sin"", 'Satan', 'perverted', 'was', 'meant', 'good', 'Father', 'world', 'Luther', 'crystals', 'crystals', 'Satan', 'deception', 'Eden', 'involve', 'was', 'make', 'one', ""'wise"", 'Too', 'evil', 'lurked', 'first', 'garden', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'confronted', 'Christ', 'Gethsemane', 'garden', 'place', 'solitude', 'evil', 'Lex', 'Luther', 'stole', 'crystals', 'Superman', 'place', 'solitude.The', 'prevalence', 'permeation', 'sin', 'world', 'pictured', 'crystals', 'growth', 'virtually', 'control', 'embedded', 'deadly', 'kryptonite', 'sting', 'sin', 'death', 'Superman', 'seeking', 'be', 'savior', 'seemingly', 'defeated', 'Luther', 'Satan', 'cruel', 'mistreatment', 'villain', 'hand', 'reminiscent', 'Christ', 'torture', 'Romans', 'similar', 'vein', 'torture', 'Aslan', 'White', 'Witch', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe.At', 'last', 'Superman', 'stabbed', 'Luther', 'one', 'deadly', 'crystals', 'Christ', 'sting', 'death', 'sin', 'innocent', 'descent', 'deep', ""'abyss"", 'sea', 'not', 'final', 'death', 'scene', 'reminding', 'one', 'Christ', 'descent', 'belly', 'earth', 'Superman', 'will', 'eventually', 'return', 'rid', 'planet', 'evil', 'lifting', 'entire', 'thorny-appearing', 'dark', 'crystal', 'skyward', 'Christ', 'being', 'lifted', 'up', 'bearing', 'sin', 'world', 'separating', 'forever', 'earth', 'end', 'empty', 'hospital', 'room', 'where', 'Superman', 'screams', 'tomb', 'Christ', 'even', 'clothing', 'neatly', 'folded', 'beside', 'hero', 'gloriously', 'death', 'clouds', 'reminding', 'who', 'would', 'miss', ""'m"", 'always', 'around', 'much', 'Christ', 'am', 'always', '.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'scenes', 'plot', 'twists', 'made', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'impossible', 'miss', 'messianic', 'overtones']",N/A

It's a great ride and it brings back the kid in you just in the opening credits and hearing the John Williams classic musical score. Superman returns after 5 years of looking for any piece of Krypton that he can find. He returns to find Lois engaged to Perry White's son played by James Marsden (X-Men) and with a kid as well. He finds himself needed again just when he's settiling in. Lex Luther has an evil plan to basically turn Earth into Krypton in a world where he'd be the leader.This movie is 10 times better than Superman 3 and 4. It's not better than part 1 or 2 but it's right up there with them at least. Brandon Routh may not be as good as Christopher Reeves as playing Clark Kent or Superman. However he is the best Superman next to Reeves. Routh's Superman looks like he popped right out of the comic book. He may not have Reeves' charm but he still makes a very heroic Superman. As for playing a bumbling reporter, he needs to work on that a lot before the next movies. Ebert was way off though when he said he barely had any lines because they probably dind't know if he could act. Routh has a good part at the end where he delivers the lines that were once said to him by his father. He does it well too.Kate Bosworth's Lois is more vulnerable than the kind of Lois we're used to. I mean she gets knocked around violently by one of Lex's bodyguards. You know the Erica Durance Lois in Smallville wouldn't take that [...]. Erica Durance is a very good Lois and it's sad that Smallville is only interested in pushing Lana in our face constantly and they don't  know how to use Lois. Anyway Bosworth still looks the part at least and does give us a different Lois even if it's not a better Lois.Kevin Spacey is excellent as Lex Luther, he basically gives us an older version of Michael Rosenbaum's Lex in Smallville. Gene Hackman was a great Lex Luther too but his was a little too whacky. Spacey makes a great ruthless and scary Luther and it's one of his best performances in awhile. Parker Posey is also excellent as his partner Kitty. She livened up movies that weren't that good, like Scream 3 and Blade Trinity. Here she's finally in a good a movie and has really good chemestry with Spacey. Hell they have better chemestry than Routh and Bosworth who don't have Reeves and Margot Kidder chemestry.One problem with the film is that....Lois Lane and Clark never work together. She never even wonders why Clark isn't around when Superman is around. It is funny though when Lois and her fiance joke about how Clark and Superman have the same height and built. Plus although Spacey is a great Lex Luther, I am sort of Lex Luthered out. I know part 3 sucked when it tried to have someone other than Luther as the villian. But I'd love to see Darkseid in a Superman movie for once . They need someone evil with powers like part 2 had Zod. I'd like something like that instead of just Luther as the villian again.

1023493,A4GPHAI2LRIQI,B000J10EQU,"JJD ""John""","[15, 46]","Let me begin by stating that the original Superman film with Chris Reeve is one on my dearest memories from childhood. From the majestic opening credits to the uncanny way they made his flying believable (the pre-CGI days..remember those?). Verisimilitude is what Donner called it..making the unbelievable seem totally grounded in reality. Seeing that film with my Dad in the Christmas of 78 will be etched in my memory for a long time. Why, you ask? Not because I was 9 and the world seemed innocent and fresh and not because every kid loves a superhero flick. It was because Donner completely NAILED that character. He took what would seem to be a sappy, boy scout, goodie-goodie character seem respectable and completely admirable. This during the jaded and disillusioned 70's. We rooted not only for Reeve, the wide eyed young actor in his first major film role, but for Superman and all his ""truth, justice, and the American way"" idealism. Even during the post-Vietnam skepticism that the country was still tasting.That said...enter Bryan Singer. Here's a guy that made one of the best crime dramas ever put on celluloid (The Usual Suspects) as well as taking an obscure, although having a rabid fan following, comic book and making two films that not only NAILED the nature and spirit of the source material, but made it accessible for even the most clueless of film-goers. I'm talking, of course, about X-Men.If ever I had faith in a director to bring back the Man-Of-Steel to a new generation of movie watchers and possibly recapture the magic of the original Donner film, he was just the guy to do it. This is what makes this review all the more painful because he did just the opposite. Not only did I find this film to be a complete insult to the Superman mythos new and old, but I found it to be melodramatic dribble.Singer manages to suck you in at the opening credits with Brando's voice overlooking the planet Krypton as we know it to be in the original film. Then the planet explodes in a way far more dramatic than the original and it is stunning to watch. The credits roll over John Williams' rousing anthem and the audience is entranced. I almost had tears as I watched with my 11 year-old son as it reminded me so much of my experience with my father. After that..it's all downhill.Superman is poorly written as a bit of a creep. Part voyeur (he uses his x-ray vision to spy on Lois at her boyfriend's home), part narcissist in the prideful way he tells Lois the world needs him, and worst of all..part deadbeat dad. If this is a spoiler to you, then you have shown no interest in the film to begin with. Yes, Superman had fathered a child with Lois (see Superman II) and then just took off for 5 years when he discovers that scientists believe Krypton still may exist. This after apologizing to the president for being away for so long at the end of Superman II. This is supposed to be a direct sequel?? Man..Singer and his boys failed to do their research.Another thing that got on my nerves was the way Singer injected Superman with a Christ complex. Okay Brian..He's the only son of Jor-El and was sent to Earth to save us from ourselves..We get it!!! Having him fall to the Earth in a crucifixion-like way was a bit over the top. One more example of Hollywood's disdain for Christians. I'm sure I'm also not the only one who noticed Perry White's inability to say ""..and the American way"". It just come out as ""Does he still stand for truth, justice, and all that other stuff..?"". One more example of Hollywood's hatred for American pride and values.Some of you may be wondering..""Why so upset over a stupid comic book movie?"". I'll tell you why. Superman is the icon and the standard by which all superheroes that have followed him owe a tremendous debt to. He got us through the darkest days of the depression and World War II. We flew with him during the cynicism of the Vietnam era and the trashed sensibilities brought forth by the ""flower power"" generation. Even through highs and lows in popularity, he has always been someone to look up to in a metaphoric way. Someone good, honest, and unwavering in his morals and standards. Now in an age of conflict and uncertainty, when this country could use Superman the most, Singer belittles him and turns him into a man more damaged than anyone we could possibly know.Apart from Routh and Spacey, the film was poorly cast as well. Lois looks like she's fresh out of college, much less the mother of a five-year-old boy. That after having been around the block a time or two. Bosworth is still in her mid to late 20's and simply can't pull off that character. Langella was a dull Perry White. There was no fire to that character whatsoever. Worst of all...Parker Posey. The mighty indie queen has fallen.In a nutshell..if you're reading this Mr. Singer. You should simply walk away from Superman all together before you do any more damage than you already have.",1,Superman The Soap Opera,1158278400,"09 15, 2006",2006,4936,"['Let', 'begin', 'stating',

It was the perfect sequel to Superman and Superman II, starring Christopher Reeve, and I grew up watching those movies. It had to be just right, done perfectly, or I would have despised it.Brandon Routh played Superman the way Christopher Reeve did, and did so well that at times it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up, because he portrayed the character to such a tee. With Christopher Reeve unfortunately out of the running to play the role, *I think Routh was the only one who could fill his shoes. He paid tribute to Reeve very well.Lex Luthor's character was a little edgier and angrier than in the original movies, but that is doubtless explained by 5 years' imprisonment, and he wasn't so over the top that it completely distorted the original character. Lois Lane's character was well-portrayed by Kate Bosworth. Although she seemed a little malnourished, she had spunk and I actually liked her in the role better than Margot Kidder.As a film-score fan, and one who grew up humming John Williams' original Superman theme, the score also had to be perfect, and John Ottman not only retained the theme, but also worked himself to death to ensure that the entire film, from beginning to end, had an A1 score. I hope that John Williams was proud of Ottman's work, because he should have been.Word has it that the Superman franchise is on indefinite hold because of legal battles over rights and royalties. It is also rumored that WB was so unpleased with the film's nearly $400 million gross (?!) that they might take the franchise in an edgier direction in the future. That would be a horrible mistake... Superman is not, and never has been, dark or frightening. It is not Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, or anything even remotely like it, and it never should be. This film was the only way it could have been done, and kudos to Brian Singer for reviving a legend.",5,The Only Way It Could Have Been Done...

1023495,A8F2AZWB20X1H,B000J10EQU,JLind555,"[2, 5]","Never mind the plot rehash, it's been rehashed through 150 reviews already, and the ""Superman"" genre was never about plot anyway.  The Man of Steel has been around saving the planet since 1939 and he's back, after a five-year hiatus, to do more of the same.  Nothing much new there.  But there have been some interesting character changes and two of them are noteworthy.First of all is Brandon Routh as Superman.  Even before Christopher Reeve's tragic accident, he had run his course in this role; the films had gone downhill after the second movie and hit rock bottom in ""Superman IV"".  But Reeve was so perfect in the part; he looked exactly how everyone ever imagined Superman must look like, and one could only wonder if anyone could ever fill Reeves boots in this sequel.  But just as Richard Donner used a then-unknown Reeve in ""Superman"", Brian Singer wisely cast another unknown in this film, and Brandon Routh is a very good Superman indeed.  He looks every bit as much the character as Reeves did and his acting in the part is just as good.  He doesn't need to fill Reeve's boots; he wears his own Superman boots very well.The second important character change is Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor.  I thought Spacey was great in this role, much better than Gene Hackman.  Hackman played Luthor for laughs; Spacey plays the part for pure evil menace, much as Superman's creator intended.  Spacey plays Luthor to the hilt, gleefully pulling every trick in the book to destroy his nemesis and almost succeeding.  He and Routh are two great reasons to go see this film.The other actors give creditable performances, especially Frank Langella as the editor of the Daily Planet; I liked him better in that role than Jackie Cooper.  The plot is predictable; we know Superman will save the day, so what else is new?  What blows us out of our shoes in this production is the jaw-dropping, eye-popping experience of watching it in IMAX-3D.  The special effects are so incredible in IMAX that you feel like you're literally falling out of your seat right into the screen.  There's almost no way to describe it; it has to be experienced to believe it.  I'm still wondering, though, why Singer chose to shoot some, but not all scenes in 3D, which means you have to keep putting on and taking off your 3D glasses as the scene changes demand, but maybe watching the whole film in 3D might be too much of a sensory overload.  All I can tell you is that once you've seen this movie in IMAX, you'll never want to see it in any other format.  No, I'm not waiting for the DVD.  A DVD would be a flat letdown after seeing this movie in an IMAX theater.What ""Superman Returns"" adds up to is a fun movie.  There's been a lot of serious analysis of Superman as some kind of Messiah figure in this film, saving the world and mankind from the evil machinations of Lex Luthor and his dastardly henchmen.  Please.  Superman has never been other than a comic book figure and he still isn't.  But he's great fun to watch, and the IMAX production is a mind-blowing experience you won't forget in a hurry.  Make tracks to the nearest IMAX theater and prepare for the ride of your life.Judy Lind",4,"It absolutely, positively, MUST be seen in IMAX!",1152144000,"07 6, 2006",2006,3167,"['Never', 'mind', 'plot', 'rehash', 'been', 'rehashed', '150', 'reviews', 'already', 'Superman', 'genre', 'was', 'never', 'plot', 'anyway', 'Man', 'Steel', 'been', 'saving', 'planet', '1939', 'back', 'five-year', 'hiatus', 'do', 'more', 'same', 'Nothing', 'much', 'new', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'character', 'changes', 'two', 'are', 'noteworthy.First', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'Superman', 'Even', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'tragic', 'accident', 'had', 'run', 'course', 'role', 'films', 'had', 'gone', 'downhill', 'second', 'movie', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'Superman', 'IV', 'Reeve', 'was', 'so', 'perfect', 'part', 'looked', 'exactly', 'how', 'everyone', 'ever', 'imagined', 'Superman', 'must', 'look', 'one', 'could', 'only', 'wonder', 'anyone', 'could', 'ever', 'fill', 'Reeves', 'boots', 'sequel', 'just', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'used', 'then-unknown', 'Reeve', 'Superman', 'Brian', 'Singer', 'wisely', 'cast', 'unknown', 'film', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'very', 'good', 'Superman', 'indeed', 'bit', 'much', 'character', 'Reeves', 'did', 'acting', 'part', 'just', 'as', 'good', ""n't"", 'need', 'fill', 'Reeve', 'boots', 'own', 'Superman', 'boots', 'very', 'well.The', 'second', 'important', 'character', 'change', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'thought', 'Spacey', 'was', 'great', 'role', 'much', 'better', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Hackman', 'played', 'Luthor', 'laughs', 'Spacey', 'part', 'pure', 'evil', 'menace', 'much', 'Superman', 'creator', 'intended', 'Spacey', 'Luthor', 'hilt', 'gleefully', 'pulling', 'trick', 'book', 'destroy', 'nemesis', 'almost', 'succeeding', 'Routh', 'are', 'two', 'great', 'reasons', 'go', 'see', 'film.The', 'other', 'actors', 'give', 'creditable', 'performances', 'especially', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'editor', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'liked', 'better', 'role', 'Jackie', 'Cooper', 'plot', 'predictable', 'know', 'Superman', 'will', 'save', 'day', 'what', 'else', 'new', 'What', 'shoes', 'production', 'jaw-dropping', 'eye-popping', 'experience', 'watching', 'IMAX-3D', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'so', 'incredible', 'IMAX', 'feel', ""'re"", 'literally', 'falling', 'seat', 'right', 'screen', 'almost', 'way', 'describe', 'be', 'experienced', 'believe', ""'m"", 'still', 'wondering', 'though', 'why', 'Singer', 'chose', 'shoot', 'not', 'scenes', '3D', 'have', 'keep', 'putting', 'taking', 'off', '3D', 'glasses', 'scene', 'changes', 'demand', 'maybe', 'watching', 'whole', 'film', '3D', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'sensory', 'overload', 'can', 'tell', 'once', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'IMAX', ""'ll"", 'never', 'want', 'see', 'other', 'format', 'No', ""'m"", 'not', 'waiting', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'flat', 'letdown', 'seeing', 'movie', 'IMAX', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'up', 'fun', 'movie', 'been', 'lot', 'serious', 'analysis', 'Superman', 'kind', 'Messiah', 'figure', 'film', 'saving', 'world', 'mankind', 'evil', 'machinations', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'dastardly', 'henchmen', 'Please', 'Superman', 'never', 'been', 'other', 'comic', 'book', 'figure', 'still', ""n't"", 'great', 'fun', 'watch', 'IMAX', 'production', 'mind-blowing', 'experience', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget', 'hurry', 'Make', 'tracks', 'nearest', 'IMAX', 'theater', 'prepare', 'ride', 'life.Judy']",N/A
1023496,A3OFB18116P6RM,B000J10EQU,J. L. Reimer,"[0, 3]","Where to start? It is simply speaking phenomenal. Bryan Singer was already at the top of my list for director/producers that I admire. He's stepped it up here.If you didn't already know, the movie assumes Superman: The Movie and Superman II occurred. Superman III and Superman IV did not. It is not a reinvention of the character or story. It's a continuation. If it has been a while since you've seen the first two movies, you'll benefit by re watching before you see Superman Returns. You won't miss anything if you don't have time though. It simply adds to the experience.John Williams' Superman theme music remains the Superman theme. I'm pleased they didn't try to create a new theme for Superman, because Williams' theme is iconic. While creating a new score for the Superman Returns, the composer, John Ottman draws inspiration from Williams' original score and you'll catch reflections of that throughout the film. It's nicely done and I'll be purchasing the CD as soon as possible.All the effects are wonderful. The special effects in the action sequences are breathtaking. They kept me on the edge of my seat. But I was also impressed by the less noticeable special effects such as the city of Metropolis. It looks like a real city. It's big. It's sprawling. It's old and new. Unlike previous movies, Metropolis is more than the gritty bustle surrounding the Daily Planet. It has added depth and dimension to the character of the city.Brandon Routh is the new Superman. He draws inspiration from Christopher Reeve's performance as both Superman and Clark Kent (more noticeably Clark) but he isn't simply mimicking Chris Reeve. He makes it his own. (The film is dedicated to Chris and Dana Reeve toward the beginning of the end credits.) I was overwhelmed when he first appears in The Suit as Superman. And charmed by his bumbling Clark Kent. The physical change he makes between the two is amazing, with little more than a change of posture and removal of the glasses. You can believe people would look past Clark if they speculated on Superman's alternate identity.I initially wasn't sure of Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane but she works in the role. It didn't help that I kept seeing pictures of her as a blonde and while the trailers showed her in character and brunette, it wasn't enough to gauge her character. But I actually believe in her Lois Lane more than I could in the original movies, both as an investigative reporter and romantic interest. The chemistry between this Lois and Superman is strong and the chemistry between Lois and her fiance is also good which strengthens the emotional conflict of the film.Kevin Spacey is perfect as Lex Luther. In the earlier films, I felt the comedy aspect overshadowed Lex's power and potential menace. Kevin Spacey gives that to Lex. Like his role in Usual Suspects, he disappears in to the character and despite being easily recognisable you don't see Kevin Spacey as Lex...you see Lex. He is powerful. He is menacing. He is a threat. There are comic touches to him. You can't have Lex Luther on the screen without those touches, but the balance is different. Instead of slapstick, it is ironic humor borne out of the truth of his intent...a much darker comic element.To touch on a few of the other characters: Sam Huntington is exactly right as Jimmy. He's geeky and charming in a funny sort of way. His Jimmy fits well in the history of his character. It was wonderful to see him get to have a small scene played against the original Jimmy, Jack Larson. Unless familiar with the George Reeves' Adventures of Superman series and what Jack Larson looks like today versus then, you wouldn't realise the underlying significance of the scene so it mainly adds another element for the hardcore Superman fan. The same can be said of Noel Neill, the original Lois Lane in another small part. Frank Langella is a fantastic actor and does Perry White proud. I would like for him to have had more time onscreen but there was so much going on it would have been difficult to make the film longer just to do that. And since all of the actors are committed to two more Superman movies, I'm sure we'll see more of him. (I just hope Bryan Singer agrees to do the next two films as well.) Another significant character in the form of Jor-El also returns and I'll just say I am happy with the way they did this. I also liked Eva Marie Saint as Martha and look forward to some expansion of her role in the next film. Despite her limited time onscreen, she gave an honest performance that added layers to the time she did have.Superman Returns is a fantastic movie.While I doubt it will become a classic in the way of the original movie, it honors, enhances and expands it and the second film. It deserves to be part of the Superman mythology, as I have no doubt it will, and I'm looking forward to the sequels.Superman is back!

When Superman got there, all that remained was a graveyard.  He came to the final conclusion that HE is all that was left from his civilization.  With this is mind, he had no where to go but back to Earth.Unfortunately, in the mean time, the sinister Lex Luthor discovered the strange, almost magical crystals that came from Superman's planet.  He leaned how to harness them for his own evil ends.  He also commandeers the recordings that Superman's deceased father had created, and listens to them in order to understand the extent of his new found powers.  He creates a continent, a continent that will cause global flooding and kill billions.  He steals kryptonite and makes it a fundamental piece of the new continent so that Superman cannot interfere!Meanwhile, in Superman's personal life, the lovely Lois Lane is engaged to marry and now has a son.  Superman now has a forminable enemy and a larger void in his personal life.  The movie shows how Superman uses his wit and attempts to get around the problem of a Kryptonite laced continent and still defeat Lex Luthor.Aside from the main plot that involves an evil new continent and love for Lois Lane, Superman also goes back to his old ways of saving lives and fighitng crime.  There are several scenes that show him dominate and subdue common criminals.  He defeats things such as machineguns and catches falling innocents.  There is also a somewhat-related scene, when he tries to save a spaceship and and airplane.  In this particular scene, there are great special effects.If you are somewhat attached to the original Superman, you will be pleased, as those who did the casting did a pretty good job in selecting characters to this sequel.

(This is unlike Batman Begins which completely rebooted the Batman series.) There are good and bad parts about this movie.The Good:For one I think Brandon Routh did a great job playing Superman. He sounded and looked like Reeves. Parker Posey was very funny as Lex Luthor's sidekick. The cinematography and effects were decent.  The movie paid homage to the original movie like the beginning credits. The original John Williams Superman theme song was used throughout the movie. Overall, the movie was entertaining enough to recommend.The Bad:Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane. She just didn't impress me. Margot Kidder was a lot better and more likable.

I thought that they have done enough and just leave the series alone.When I went to see this one, I was happily suprised to find that they used the music from the original sagas and that they didn't try to outdo the original series but pay homage to them and tell a different account of Superman.  Brandon Routh is a great Superman (unfortunately it will leave him typecast for the rest of his career), Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane is excellent (and she is so SEXY!), and Kevin Spacey as Lex Luther was great (wouldn't it been fun to see Gene Hackman as Lex Luther Sr.?)

1023508,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B000J10EQU,John Kwok,"[1, 2]","Along with fellow director Sam Raimi, Bryan Singer ought to be regarded now as the best American director of films based on comic book heroes. Having enjoyed his two fine filmed adaptations of the ""X-Men"" comic books, I had little reason to expect anything worse than yet another decent film adaptation from Singer. With ""Superman Returns"", Bryan Singer pays ample homage to Richard Donner's great 1978 ""Superman"" film and offers a superb cinematic epic in what promises to be a successful re-launch of a ""Superman"" film series. Much to my surprise, Singer's riveting new film isn't nearly as dark as his two ""X-Men"" films, but instead, remains true to the optimism and light comedy which Donner conveyed successfully on screen. Indeed, ""Superman Returns"" should be regarded as the immediate sequel to the first two ""Superman"" films starring the late Christopher Reeve, since it is set approximately five years after the second (1980) film, relying once more on John Williams' memorable ""Superman"" theme (courtesy of young film composer John Ottman, a frequent collaborator of Singer's) and a brief, digitally-realized cameo appearance of Marlon Brando as Superman/Clark Kent's father.Much of ""Superman Returns"" success is due to a fine script written by Bryan Singer's ""X-Men"" collaborators, Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris, and excellent acting from a truly memorable cast featuring distinguished veterans like Eva Marie Saint (""Martha Kent"") and Frank Langella (""Perry White""). Although others have unfairly compared Brandon Routh's portrayal of Superman/Clark Kent to the late Christopher Reeve's, I found his portrayal quite credible, without trying too much to be quite evocative of his famous predecessor's brilliant portrayal. Without question, the best acting honors goes to actor Kevin Spacey, who brings a disarmingly devilish twist to Lex Luthor, transforming him into a more malevolent villain than Gene Hackman's splendid portrayal. Parker Posey is almost as fine too as Lex's femme fatale companion Kitty Kowalski. Actor Kevin Huntington steals nearly every scene he appears as the earnest, if naive, photojournalist Jimmy Olsen. I also enjoyed Kate Bosworth's portrayal of Lois Lane, but I will concede that hers isn't nearly as romantic as Margot Kidder's. And I didn't see nearly as much of a romantic chemistry between her and Routh (or with James Marsden, who portrays her fiance, Richard White, Perry White's nephew) as I recall seeing between Kidder and Reeve in the first two ""Superman"" films.Bryan Singer's direction is superb, though ""Superman Returns"" isn't as visually exciting as his two ""X-Men"" films. Still there are plenty of superb action sequences, beginning with Superman's breath-taking rescue of an out-of-control U. S. Air Force Boeing 777. All of these action sequences had the audience's rapt attention during a screening I saw yesterday afternoon. Singer's splendid ""Superman Returns""  is undoubtedly a vivid, well-executed re-launch of the Man of the Steel as a potential cinematic franchise along the lines of the James Bond and ""Star Wars"" films. Having enjoyed Singer's ""Superman Returns"", I look forward to the prospect of a possible revival of the ""Star Trek"" movie franchise, which Singer may be at work on soon.",5,"Fine, Rather Memorable ""Superman Returns""",1152057600,"07 5, 2006",2006,3260,"['fellow', 'director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'ought', 'be', 'regarded', 'now', 'best', 'American', 'director', 'films', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'heroes', 'Having', 'enjoyed', 'two', 'fine', 'filmed', 'adaptations', 'X-Men', 'comic', 'books', 'had', 'little', 'reason', 'expect', 'anything', 'worse', 'yet', 'decent', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Singer', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'ample', 'homage', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'great', '1978', 'Superman', 'film', 'superb', 'cinematic', 'epic', 'what', 'be', 'successful', 're-launch', 'Superman', 'film', 'series', 'Much', 'surprise', 'Singer', 'riveting', 'new', 'film', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'dark', 'two', 'X-Men', 'films', 'instead', 'true', 'optimism', 'light', 'comedy', 'Donner', 'conveyed', 'successfully', 'screen', 'Indeed', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'should', 'be', 'regarded', 'immediate', 'sequel', 'first', 'two', 'Superman', 'films', 'starring', 'late', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'set', 'approximately', 'five', 'years', 'second', '1980', 'film', 'relying', 'once', 'more', 'John', 'Williams', 'memorable', 'Superman', 'theme', 'courtesy', 'young', 'film', 'composer', 'John', 'Ottman', 'frequent', 'collaborator', 'Singer', 'brief', 'digitally-realized', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Superman/Clark', 'Kent', 'father.Much', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'success', 'due', 'fine', 'script', 'written', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'X-Men', 'collaborators', 'Michael', 'Dougherty', 'Dan', 'Harris', 'excellent', 'acting', 'truly', 'memorable', 'cast', 'featuring', 'distinguished', 'veterans', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'Martha', 'Kent', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'Perry', 'White', 'others', 'have', 'unfairly', 'compared', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'portrayal', 'Superman/Clark', 'Kent', 'late', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'found', 'portrayal', 'quite', 'credible', 'trying', 'too', 'much', 'be', 'quite', 'evocative', 'famous', 'predecessor', 'brilliant', 'portrayal', 'question', 'best', 'acting', 'honors', 'actor', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'who', 'disarmingly', 'devilish', 'twist', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'transforming', 'more', 'malevolent', 'villain', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'splendid', 'portrayal', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'almost', 'fine', 'too', 'Lex', 'femme', 'fatale', 'companion', 'Kitty', 'Kowalski', 'Actor', 'Kevin', 'Huntington', 'steals', 'nearly', 'scene', 'earnest', 'naive', 'photojournalist', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'portrayal', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'will', 'concede', 'hers', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'romantic', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'romantic', 'chemistry', 'Routh', 'James', 'Marsden', 'who', 'fiance', 'Richard', 'White', 'Perry', 'White', 'nephew', 'recall', 'seeing', 'Kidder', 'Reeve', 'first', 'two', 'Superman', 'films.Bryan', 'Singer', 'direction', 'superb', 'Superman', 'Returns', ""n't"", 'visually', 'exciting', 'two', 'X-Men', 'films', 'Still', 'are', 'plenty', 'superb', 'action', 'sequences', 'beginning', 'Superman', 'breath-taking', 'rescue', 'out-of-control', 'U.', 'S.', 'Air', 'Force', 'Boeing', '777', 'action', 'sequences', 'had', 'audience', 'rapt', 'attention', 'screening', 'saw', 'yesterday', 'afternoon', 'Singer', 'splendid', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'undoubtedly', 'vivid', 'well-executed', 're-launch', 'Man', 'Steel', 'potential', 'cinematic', 'franchise', 'lines', 'James', 'Bond', 'Star', 'Wars', 'films', 'Having', 'enjoyed', 'Singer', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'look', 'forward', 'prospect', 'possible', 'revival', 'Star', 'Trek', 'movie', 'franchise', 'Singer', 'may', 'be', 'work', 'soon']",N/A

I just want to give a few thoughts on this movie...Superman Returns (2006) is a solid Superman movie sequel.  I saw it in the theater when it came out.  The original Superman movies with Christopher Reeve were good (at least the first two were).  While I don't think Superman Returns has quite the depth of these movies as far as story, plot, and characters, I consider it a pretty good movie.  Kevin Spacey was good as Lex Luthor.  I thought Brandon Routh did very well as Clark Kent/Superman.  He looks so much like Reeve in this movie.  Some people say he gave too many nods to Christopher Reeve, but whatever.  I didn't care for Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane.It was great to see Eva Marie Saint in this movie.  It was also great seeing Frank Langella.I've never been a big fan of Superman in general (comic books, movies, etc.).  To me, Superman is just some immortal guy who has super powers.  He's a character that's harder for people to relate to compared to, say, Batman.  Batman is mortal and he trained to learn his fighting techniques.  He's easier to relate to.I recommend seeing Superman Returns.",4,Solid and underrated,1355788800,"12 18, 2012",2012,1164,"['description', 'plot', 'etc.', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'just', 'want', 'give', 'few', 'thoughts', 'movie', 'Superman', 'Returns', '2006', 'solid', 'Superman', 'movie', 'sequel', 'saw', 'theater', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'original', 'Superman', 'movies', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'were', 'good', 'least', 'first', 'two', 'were', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'quite', 'depth', 'movies', 'as', 'far', 'story', 'plot', 'characters', 'consider', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'was', 'good', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'thought', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'Clark', 'Kent/Superman', 'so', 'much', 'Reeve', 'movie', 'people', 'say', 'gave', 'too', 'many', 'nods', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'Lois', 'Lane.It', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'seeing', 'Frank', 'Langella.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Superman', 'general', 'comic', 'books', 'movies', 'etc.', 'Superman', 'just', 'immortal', 'guy', 'who', 'super', 'powers', 'character', 'harder', 'people', 'relate', 'compared', 'say', 'Batman', 'Batman', 'mortal', 'trained', 'learn', 'fighting', 'techniques', 'easier', 'relate', 'to.I', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'Superman', 'Returns']",N/A
1023514,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B000J10EQU,Jonathan Appleseed,"[2, 7]","In a movie overpopulated with miscasts, Brandon Routh was a delight as Superman. Sadly, he wasn't given much to work with. The movie itself was anything but a delight, as it didn't pass my ""must make sense"" meter.I like to watch films that would be classified as fantasy (and this would) with people who don't intrinsically understand fantasy. What I mean is that if a little green man pops up behind a tree and does something magical, the person I'm watching the film with should understand what the little green man's purpose is at some point prior to the conclusion of the film. If they don't, then I think the movie or story failed to establish itself appropriately. One friend of mine, who is a scientist, reads the books that win Pulitzers, yet loved the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings films. To me, his assessment of whether the filmmakers did what they needed to do to make fantasy reality is a good one. That said, I've disagreed with him more than once, and the word idiot has surfaced. When it did, that never went well with us. &lt;grin>That said, I believe that fantasy needs to make sense. But, you say, it's fantasy! It doesn't need to make sense!Not so.More than any other genre, fantasy has to make sense, because it has more to prove. You question this? Think on Gollum.Here we have Lex Luthor, taking a crystal from the Fortress of Solitude and encasing it a hand-made cylinder of Kryptonite (what a guess!), and launching it into the ocean, using it to try to create a continent that somehow - magically perhaps? - creates a habitable continent that will not only destroy all of the United States with the exception of the western states (YIKES...is Bryan Singer really a friend of Ann Coulter?) but will have its own mapped states - for indeed, the continent as Lex showed it looked a bit like Australia, chopped up into ""regions"".Sigh.As to the miscasts, Lois Lane looked more like a porcelain doll, and her son - and I feel horrible for saying this - just couldn't be a product of his parents, regardless of what angle they're playing. Lex Luthor was a brainless wimp who resorted to stupid bully tactics when faced with a ""kryptonited"" Superman. For someone smart enough to encase a crystal in kryptonite, he certainly showed himself for a fool. His thugs - well, some of his thugs didn't even have muscles. One appeared in a movie that served as a White Castle commercial.My guess is that since Gene Hackman played Lex Luthor in the 70s, they wanted another good actor to play Lex Luthor. The problem with that line of thinking is that when they tried to pick a good actor in the 21st century, they settled on an average actor: Kevin Spacey.One who wasn't miscast, but also wasn't given much material: Parker Posey. She's always a delight in whatever she does. I just saw her in ""For Your Consideration"", and she took what she was given and did a terrific job with it. Here, she did the same. Again - she wasn't given much.Even though I felt this was a disaster of a film, I'd like to see another. Certainly not from the same production team or screenwriters, but there is something in Superman's ""mythology"" to mine: ""The Death of Superman"". In the early 1990s, Superman faced a foe capable of astonishing destruction, and that series of comics sold more for DC than any other. The sequence needs to be brought to the screen, and I believe Brandon Routh is the right Superman to play the part. With CGI where it is (again, think Gollum or anything from The Lord of the Rings that wasn't human), the timing is right.Let's see it.And let's have the studios give Brandon Routh another chance with better material.

And yes, the movie had some entertaining areas, but really I think it fell short of what it could've been.  A few weak spots:- Too many scenes of flying around.  Yes, we get it: it's cool if you can fly and look at the pretty scenery.  But honestly, by this point I think the novelty of Superman simply flying Lois around has worn off to the point where it doesn't merit a 5 minute flight scene with no dialogue.- Characters seem a bit wooden.  Routh and Holmes as Clark and Lois: well, they weren't bad, but really there was no fire in their relationship.- As many have pointed out, Superman picking up an island made out of kryptonite really doesn't make sense.  Sure, you could say ""But he's Superman! He can do anything!"", but you have to stick to the rules of the movie.  If simply being near kryptonite makes Superman double over in pain, there is no way he could pull off the island-lifting scene, regardless of how long a sun-bath he had.- Lex Luthor: eh...  I like Kevin Spacey and all, but he just wasn't diabolical / genius enough.  Really, he should've been more competent an adversary for Superman.- And lastly, one must question the morality involved in Superman attempting to break up Lois's happy marriage.

But, like the earlier film, those traits are more than enough to recommend it. In many ways, in fact, this film feels more like a remake of that first Christopher Reeve film than a quasi-continuation of the Reeve series.For example, ""Superman"" featured a plot centering around Lex Luthor's scheme to create a new West Coast of the United States. ""Superman Returns"" features a plot centering around Lex Luthor's scheme to create a new continent. ""Superman"" featured a sequence showing Superman being dumped into a swimming pool with a hunk of kryptonite chained around his neck, with him luckily being rescued by a woman who jumps into the water and removes the kryptonite from his person. ""Superman Returns"" features a sequence showing Superman being dumped into the ocean with a hunk of kryptonite jammed into his side, with him luckily being rescued by a woman who jumps into the water and removes the kryptonite from his person. The former film shows Supes rescuing Lois from a helicopter mishap. The new film shows Supes rescuing Lois from a jetliner mishap. In other words, in classic remake fashion, the new film just upped the ante and created fancier versions of those earlier scenes. So, if you don't mind that approach (and especially if you liked the earlier film), you shouldn't have much of a problem here.Of course, ""Superman Returns"" doesn't completely take the remake approach. It also functions as sort of quasi-sequel, making it clear that to some extent the events of the earlier films happened to this new Superman we're seeing. I say ""quasi-sequel"" because director Brian Singer seems to pick and choose among the details of the earlier mythology, keeping some and discarding others. For example, it's acknowledged in the new film that Superman and Lois did indeed have a previous relationship, but it's pretty clear that it likely didn't happen exactly as depicted in the Donner/Lester films. If it DID happen pretty much the way we remember way back when (especially in ""Superman II""), the NEXT Singer/Routh film will need a scene like this to smooth over all the plot contortions:Supes: I'm sorry for everything. You must have been pretty confused when you found yourself... expecting. I, uh, made you sort of forget that we ever... became close.Lois: Yes... I remembered the feelings, the emotions, the fact that we had a connection... but, yeah... I didn't remember that we, uh... you know.Supes: So, what did you think when...?Lois: Actually, I guess I have you to thank for me not going crazy wondering what happened to me. Now that I know the truth about Jason, as far as I can guess... your, uh, alien DNA or whatever- mixing with my human DNA- resulted in a pregnancy that took well over a year to come to term. And I didn't show for the longest time. Another side effect of our... ""hybrid union"", I guess. So, by the time it WAS clear I was pregnant, I had long since been dating Richard and just thought the baby was his. Honestly, I wasn't trying to hide anything from you.Supes: I know. But what do we do now?But we'll let the film writers finish up the above scenario if they choose to do so in the next ""Superman"" installment... ""Superman Returns Again"", perhaps? My point is, even though I hope the next chapter is more of a fun roller coaster ride where Superman really lets loose, the quirky remake/sequel nature- and ultimately ""tribute"" nature- of ""Superman Returns"" does result in a movie that is never less than interesting. And, yes, the movie does have its exciting sequences, too, even if some of those sequences are laced with those same pesky illogical quirks that plagued the exciting moments from the first film. But those are a whole other set of quibbles.So, just get the DVD (the two-disc version with all the extra features is quite well done) and sit back and enjoy the movie. Just do yourself a favor and leave your keen sense of scrutiny off to the side for later, like for when you're doing your tax returns or editing your Master's Thesis. Because, if you just try to relax and have fun with ""Superman Returns"", chances are you'll do just that.",3,"Maybe not a superlative ""Superman"" but definitely a worthy effort",1166054400,"12 14, 2006",2006,4221,"['1978', 'Superman', '2006', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'more', 'stately', 'grand', 'admirable', 'truly', 'exciting', 'fun', 'earlier', 'film', 'traits', 'are', 'more', 'enough', 'recommend', 'many', 'ways', 'fact', 'film', 'more', 'remake', 'first', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'film', 'quasi-continuation', 'Reeve', 'series.For', 'example', 'Superman', 'featured', 'plot', 'centering', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'scheme', 'create', 'new', 'West', 'Coast', 'United', 'States', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'plot', 'centering', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'scheme', 'create', 'new', 'continent', 'Superman', 'featured', 'sequence', 'showing', 'Superman', 'being', 'dumped', 'swimming', 'pool', 'hunk', 'kryptonite', 'chained', 'neck', 'luckily', 'being', 'rescued', 'woman', 'who', 'water', 'kryptonite', 'person', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'sequence', 'showing', 'Superman', 'being', 'dumped', 'ocean', 'hunk', 'kryptonite', 'jammed', 'side', 'luckily', 'being', 'rescued', 'woman', 'who', 'water', 'kryptonite', 'person', 'former', 'film', 'shows', 'Supes', 'rescuing', 'Lois', 'helicopter', 'mishap', 'new', 'film', 'shows', 'Supes', 'rescuing', 'Lois', 'jetliner', 'mishap', 'other', 'words', 'classic', 'remake', 'fashion', 'new', 'film', 'just', 'upped', 'ante', 'created', 'fancier', 'versions', 'earlier', 'scenes', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'approach', 'especially', 'liked', 'earlier', 'film', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'problem', 'here.Of', 'course', 'Superman', 'Returns', ""n't"", 'completely', 'take', 'remake', 'approach', 'also', 'sort', 'quasi-sequel', 'making', 'clear', 'extent', 'events', 'earlier', 'films', 'happened', 'new', 'Superman', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'say', 'quasi-sequel', 'director', 'Brian', 'Singer', 'pick', 'choose', 'details', 'earlier', 'mythology', 'keeping', 'discarding', 'others', 'example', 'acknowledged', 'new', 'film', 'Superman', 'Lois', 'did', 'indeed', 'have', 'previous', 'relationship', 'pretty', 'clear', 'likely', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'exactly', 'depicted', 'Donner/Lester', 'films', 'DID', 'happen', 'pretty', 'much', 'way', 'remember', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'especially', 'Superman', 'II', 'NEXT', 'Singer/Routh', 'film', 'will', 'need', 'scene', 'smooth', 'plot', 'contortions', 'Supes', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'everything', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'confused', 'when', 'found', 'expecting', 'uh', 'made', 'sort', 'forget', 'ever', 'became', 'close.Lois', 'Yes', 'remembered', 'feelings', 'emotions', 'fact', 'had', 'connection', 'yeah', 'did', ""n't"", 'remember', 'know.Supes', 'So', 'what', 'did', 'think', 'when', 'Lois', 'Actually', 'guess', 'have', 'thank', 'not', 'going', 'crazy', 'wondering', 'what', 'happened', 'Now', 'know', 'truth', 'Jason', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'guess', 'uh', 'alien', 'DNA', 'whatever-', 'mixing', 'human', 'DNA-', 'resulted', 'pregnancy', 'took', 'well', 'year', 'come', 'term', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'longest', 'time', 'side', 'effect', 'hybrid', 'union', 'guess', 'So', 'time', 'WAS', 'clear', 'was', 'pregnant', 'had', 'long', 'been', 'dating', 'Richard', 'just', 'thought', 'baby', 'was', 'Honestly', 'was', ""n't"", 'trying', 'hide', 'anything', 'you.Supes', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'now', ""'ll"", 'let', 'film', 'writers', 'finish', 'up', 'scenario', 'choose', 'do', 'so', 'next', 'Superman', 'installment', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'Again', 'perhaps', 'point', 'even', 'hope', 'next', 'chapter', 'more', 'fun', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'where', 'Superman', 'really', 'loose', 'quirky', 'remake/sequel', 'nature-', 'ultimately', 'tribute', 'nature-', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'result', 'movie', 'never', 'less', 'interesting', 'yes', 'movie', 'have', 'exciting', 'sequences', 'too', 'even', 'sequences', 'are', 'laced', 'same', 'pesky', 'illogical', 'quirks', 'plagued', 'exciting', 'moments', 'first', 'film', 'are', 'whole', 'other', 'set', 'quibbles.So', 'just', 'get', 'DVD', 'two-disc', 'version', 'extra', 'features', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'Just', 'do', 'favor', 'leave', 'keen', 'sense', 'scrutiny', 'side', 'later', 'when', ""'re"", 'doing', 'tax', 'returns', 'editing', 'Master', 'Thesis', 'just', 'try', 'relax', 'have', 'fun', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'chances', 'are', ""'ll"", 'do', 'just']",N/A
1023523,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000J10EQU,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 3]","I've never been a real big fan of comic books and have never seen a single Superman movie (although I did see that series with Dean Cain a couple times). I am familiar with Superman and, from what I can tell, this film is pretty good. It's not perfect (it's definitely way too long), but it's good, entertaining, and has some great special effects. The film is directed by Bryan Singer, who left the ""X-Men"" series to do this film and stars newcomer Brandon Routh as Superman. The movie opens with a title card that tells us that Superman disappeared for five years to explore his extinct planet Krypton. When he returns, he resumes his job at The Daily Planet under the alias Clark Kent but finds that things have changed. His love Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth, 'Beyond the Sea') has a young son, Jason, and is engaged to the editor Richard (James Marsden, 'X-Men: The Last Stand'). Meanwhile, the evil and bald Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey, 'American Beauty') has come up with a money-hungry plan for world domination...As Clark adjusts to his new life and returns to his role as Superman, Luthor discovers a way of getting lots of money AND killing Superman. Now, here are a couple problems with the movie. First, Lex Luthor's plan is idiotic...Although, that's usually the case with movie villains whether they're in a Superman movie or a James Bond movie. It's way too long...It's never dull and my favorite movie of all time has the same running time as this film, but it could've been trimmed. Bosworth's Lois Lane isn't incredibly likeable and Bosworth isn't really credible as a mother. But with the cons come the pros. Routh makes a credible Superman and the fact that he's an unknown makes it a lot more believable, because you're not thinking to yourself the entire time ""That's Brandon Routh!"" People have complained about Kevin Spacey's performance as Lex Luthor, because it's campy. And, yes, it is campy...But I think it works better this way. If he had played it straight, there would be no fun in it and with the plan Luthor has in the movie, campiness is the best choice. The movie co-starsFrank Langella, Eva Marie Saint (as Clark's mother), Parker Posey (as Kitty, Luthor's girlfriend),and Marlon Brando as Jor-El, Superman's dad. There's a fascinating Bonus Feature on the 2nd disc, detailing how they digitally recreated Brando's role from the original and placed it in this film.Posey is wonderful as Luthor's girlfriend, camping it up herself yet holding her ground against Spacey. Whenever there's a movie based on a comic book, people tend to lash out at the director.Bryan Singer has taken a lot of heat, from the beginning of the ""X-Men"" trilogy to this film. I got to say, the dude is doing a pretty good job. Could someone better have directed this movie? Probably, but I wouldn't know who. ""Superman Returns"" should please fans of the comic book or just the casual viewer, despite its shortcomings. It's worth watching, at least once.GRADE: B",4,Superman Returns,1168214400,"01 8, 2007",2007,2966,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'real', 'big', 'fan', 'comic', 'books', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'single', 'Superman', 'movie', 'did', 'see', 'series', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'couple', 'times', 'am', 'familiar', 'Superman', 'what', 'can', 'tell', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'perfect', 'definitely', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'good', 'entertaining', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'directed', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'who', 'left', 'X-Men', 'series', 'do', 'film', 'stars', 'newcomer', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'Superman', 'movie', 'title', 'card', 'Superman', 'disappeared', 'five', 'years', 'explore', 'extinct', 'planet', 'Krypton', 'When', 'job', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'alias', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'love', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'Sea', 'young', 'son', 'Jason', 'engaged', 'editor', 'Richard', 'James', 'Marsden', 'X-Men', 'Last', 'Stand', 'Meanwhile', 'evil', 'bald', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', ""'American"", 'Beauty', 'come', 'up', 'money-hungry', 'plan', 'world', 'domination', 'Clark', 'new', 'life', 'returns', 'role', 'Superman', 'Luthor', 'way', 'getting', 'lots', 'money', 'killing', 'Superman', 'Now', 'here', 'are', 'couple', 'problems', 'movie', 'First', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'plan', 'idiotic', 'usually', 'case', 'movie', 'villains', ""'re"", 'Superman', 'movie', 'James', 'Bond', 'movie', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'never', 'dull', 'favorite', 'movie', 'time', 'same', 'running', 'time', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'trimmed', 'Bosworth', 'Lois', 'Lane', ""n't"", 'incredibly', 'likeable', 'Bosworth', ""n't"", 'really', 'credible', 'mother', 'cons', 'come', 'pros', 'Routh', 'credible', 'Superman', 'fact', 'unknown', 'lot', 'more', 'believable', ""'re"", 'not', 'thinking', 'yourself', 'entire', 'time', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'People', 'have', 'complained', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'performance', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'campy', 'yes', 'campy', 'think', 'better', 'way', 'had', 'played', 'straight', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'plan', 'Luthor', 'movie', 'campiness', 'best', 'choice', 'movie', 'co-starsFrank', 'Langella', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'Clark', 'mother', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'Kitty', 'Luthor', 'girlfriend', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Jor-El', 'Superman', 'dad', 'fascinating', 'Bonus', 'Feature', '2nd', 'disc', 'detailing', 'how', 'digitally', 'recreated', 'Brando', 'role', 'original', 'placed', 'film.Posey', 'wonderful', 'Luthor', 'girlfriend', 'camping', 'up', 'yet', 'holding', 'ground', 'Spacey', 'Whenever', 'movie', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'people', 'tend', 'lash', 'out', 'director.Bryan', 'Singer', 'taken', 'lot', 'heat', 'beginning', 'X-Men', 'trilogy', 'film', 'got', 'say', 'dude', 'doing', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'Could', 'someone', 'better', 'have', 'directed', 'movie', 'Probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'should', 'please', 'fans', 'comic', 'book', 'just', 'casual', 'viewer', 'shortcomings', 'worth', 'watching', 'least', 'once.GRADE', 'B']",N/A

1023526,A28GCEHD00JFZG,B000J10EQU,Julian Kennedy,"[4, 8]","Superman Returns: 4 out of 10: This movie is definitely missing the spark that made the first two Supermans fun. (Superman 3 was pretty awful and Superman 4 is one of the worst films of all time). Superman comes across as a bit of a jerk and a bully in this film and the franchise is not all that better for it.Superman has gone away for five years in a plot contrivance that threatens to sink the film before it can begin. The claim is that he is seeking the remains of his home world (Not to sound like a comic book geek, but he if gets his powers from our yellow sun one would think he shouldn't be flying past Pluto let alone halfway across the galaxy.) He comes back, sort of says hi to mom, tortures his poor loyal dog with a tennis ball and heads to the big city where he stalks his ex-girlfriend Lois whom he did not even tell he was leaving and who has clearly gone on with her life.I'm not exaggerating the stalking. Superman hangs outsider her house using superpowers to snoop like some DC comics version of a cautionary Lifetime movie.Lex Luthor is also back with another stupid plan though Kevin Spacey does play the character well and a talented Parker Posey fills both the Otis and Mrs. Teschmacher shoes.Both leads (Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth) have zero chemistry with each other and considering they were passionate lovers, their conversations are pretty stunted and mundane.The action sequences are decent but the whole film seems to drag at two and a half hours and there is a distinct lack of joy. (You know something fun like everyone putting his or her Kryptonite up on E-bay, or Superman dating a supermodel to make Lois jealous that kind of thing, everyone seems so damn melancholy.) Speaking of melancholy, I noticed that Superman never asked about any disasters he didn't prevent while he was on his so-called vacation.

As most people have no doubt heard, this year was the year that the hero who sets the standard for other heroes, the man known as 'The Last Son of Krypton', returned to theaters after an almost 20 year absence.  After allowing the franchise to die at the hands of ""Superman 4: The Quest For Peace"" (a movie that has long been rumored to have suffered due to too much studio tampering), Warner Brothers decided the moment was finally right to bring the Man of Steel back from his Hollywood grave.  For almost a decade the WB tried very hard to get a new Superman movie off the ground, using various writers, directors, and actors, ranging from Tim Burton and Brett Ratner as directors to Nicolas Cage and Brendan Fraser as stars, and even Kevin Smith as a writer at one point.  Finally, Warner Brothers enticed director Bryan Singer (director of ""X-Men"" and ""X2: X-Men United"") to leave the series he started at Fox only months before preparing to work on the final chapter in his 'X-Men' trilogy, and join them on bringing Superman back to the big screen in a way befitting the greatest superhero of all time.""Superman Returns"" begins with a recently parolled Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) swindling a rich, old woman out of her fortune just before she dies, in hopes of using her money and resources to accomplish his greatest scheme ever, to use Kryptonian technology to take over the world, reshaping it any way he pleases.  How does Lex plan on succeeding with his mission of world domination with Superman being able to stop him.  Well, Superman (Brandon Routh) has been on a self-imposed exile to discover if Krypton may still exist somewhere in space, but after 5 years of searching he finally returns to Earth with the knowledge that he is indeed the last surviving member of the long dead planet.  However, upon Superman's return to Earth, he finds that his adopted planet has moved on, and figured out how to survive without him, including Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth).  Now Superman must come to grips with the fact that the people he cared about have moved on, and hope that he can be welcomed back into their lives as both Clark Kent and Superman.  Of course, if he is to be accepted on Earth again, there has to be an Earth to live on, so now Superman must find a way to stop Lex and advanced technology from his own world, before all hope is lost.After a nearly 20 year absence from the movie screen, was Bryan Singer's epic adventure worth the wait?  In a word, absolutely!  Bryan Singer and his writers Mike Daugherty and Dan Harris (writers of ""X2: X-Men United"") have brilliantly captured the spirit of Superman and continued on with the stories started in the previous 4 movies.  Although, if viewed in the proper context as intended by Singer, ""Superman Returns"" actually falls after ""Superman 2"", which is why many references are made to events from the first 2 movies via Jor-El (using Marlon Brando footage shot for ""Superman"" and ""Superman 2"") voiceovers.  In my opinion you can view this new installment after the fourth film that way you can fully enjoy the entire 'Superman' saga as originally intended.  The casting for ""Superman Returns"" is excellent all across the board.  Relative newcomer Brandon Routh does an excellent job of bringing Superman/Clark Kent to life, evoking the many emotions our hero goes through as he tries to redefine his place in our world.  The supporting actors each make their characters their own by taking what had previously been done with the characters throughout all their different incarnations and tweaking them for the modern day.  Kevin Spacey truly shines as Lex Luthor, though I enjoyed Gene Hackman's Lex, I feel that Kevin did a much better job of bringing the evil and duplicitous nature of Lex to life, while still holding on to some of his dark wit.  Kevin's wit actually resembles Michael Rosenbaum's portrayal on the hit TV show, ""Smallville"".  Kate Bosworth is perfect as Lois Lane, providing a much better interpretation of the character than Margot Kidder did in the Christopher Reeve movies, plus Kate is much easier on the eyes than Kidder ever was.  The rest of the cast with lesser parts were equally impressive from James Marsden's portrayal of Richard White, to Sam Huntington's Jimmy Olsen, and Frank Langella as Perry White, every actor truly shines in this movie.  The special effects for this movie are truly top-notch, the scenes with Superman flying are so incredible and awe-inspiring that you truly, honestly believe that you are actually witnessing a man flying.  The excellence that this movie achieves is so vast, that I truly could go on and on about what I think of this film, but I'll spare you having to sit here reading that, so bear with me for just one more moment as I sum up this movie.""Superman Returns"" brings the Man of Steel back to life in such a magnificent way that you leave the theater wishing there were truly heroes like him in this world and wanting to see more of Earth's greatest protector in action.  If you haven't seen this movie, then I strongly recommend that you rush out and rent it the moment it hits DVD shelves.  Before viewing this movie you may want to give yourself a refresher course on what has occurred in the previous 4 movies, or at least the first 2.  So, with all that being said, sit back, relax, and remember what it's like to believe that a man can fly.""Superman Returns"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",5,The Man of Steel's Triumphant

Brandon Routh may look too young for the role, but he portrayed Superman with integrity while remaining true to the character we all knew and loved from the original movie. He even had some of the same facial expressions, both as Supes and Clark Kent, that Chris Reeve had. I really felt like I just picked up where the ""Superman II"" movie had left off. Kevin SPacey's ""Lex Luthor"" was much more believable than Gene Hackmans, and much less campy. Yet, he looked so much like Gene that (again) I felt like they were the same person. All the cast did superb performances, and the fact that they focused a little more on establishing relationships made it perfect even for someone who never saw ""Superman the Movie"". The tag line ""You'll believe a man can fly... again"" should have been on every poster.

1023531,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000J10EQU,Kaya Savas,"[2, 3]","MOVIE: Instead of giving us X-Men: The Last Stand, Bryan Singer decided to take a grander project first. The new Superman sequel has been anticipated for quite some time now, and it truly does live up to the hype. Superman Returns basically is set after Superman II, because I think everyone can agree that we may as well just pretend that numbers III and IV don't exist. Here we see Superman returning back to Earth to find that Lois Lane is now engaged as well as being a new mother. He comes back and also finds that planet Earth is still in chaos with crime and danger around every corner. Lex Luthor is Superman's villain in this sequel once again. Kevin Spacey steals the show as the eccentric pioneer, and suprisingly looks very much like Gene Hackman. Superman Returns is a good movie, it really is. However, I think what I found subpar about it was that it tried to make the man of steel this vulnerable and emotional character. The original films made this character an icon, a character with no weaknesses that could overcome anything. I mean sure, in the hero's journey there must always be some adversity that the main character needs to overcome in order for the plot to work, but for some reason I just never saw Superman as this complex character. I'm not saying that it was bad to make Superman more complex, in fact if I saw a replica of the original with nothing new to offer then I'd be trashing the movie. I really liked Superman Returns, but I just wasn't blown away by it like we were all expecting. The movie doesn't really offer us anything we haven't seen before in other superhero movies. I still think that Spider-Man is the film franchise to beat in this genre. On the technical side I can honestly say I was blown away. The CGI work was breathtaking and very detailed. I heard a lot of people complain about the length of the movie, but I never found it to drag at all. It is a great summer blockbuster, but it wasn't great enough to make me anticpate the next installment in the franchise.ACTING: Newcomer Brandon Routh is a perfect fit for the character. His acting was not stilted or dull, and he really added great depth to the character. He had lots of great stuff to work with though, and that definately helped. Kate Bosworth did a fine job but she felt incredibly cold as a character. It seems like she was mad at Superman and that in turn made her mad at everyone else, even her son and fiance. There was no warmth from Lois Lane, and that made the romance of it all feel very dull. Kevin Spacey steals the show and does an amazing job as the power hungry Lex Luthor who plans to grow his own continent. Kevin Spacey was so good that at times I thought he overpowered the Superman character, which I thought hurt the film a little as well.BOTTOM LINE: Bryan Singer definately crafted a well made superhero movie, but when there is a superhero movie in the theater almost every few months sometimes ""well made"" is not enough. The only problem with Superman Returns is that it played it safe and didn't change that much. For example, Batman Begins completely reinvented the franchise and gave us a completely fresh new movie to enjoy. Superman Returns is great, but we've seen it all before.",4,A Great Film That Lives In The Spirit Of The Original But It Never Rises Above & Beyond,1152316800,"07 8, 2006",2006,3228,"['MOVIE', 'Instead', 'giving', 'X-Men', 'Last', 'Stand', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'decided', 'take', 'grander', 'project', 'first', 'new', 'Superman', 'sequel', 'been', 'anticipated', 'quite', 'time', 'now', 'truly', 'live', 'hype', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'basically', 'set', 'Superman', 'II', 'think', 'everyone', 'can', 'agree', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'pretend', 'numbers', 'III', 'IV', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'Here', 'see', 'Superman', 'returning', 'back', 'Earth', 'find', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'now', 'engaged', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'new', 'mother', 'back', 'also', 'planet', 'Earth', 'still', 'chaos', 'crime', 'danger', 'around', 'corner', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Superman', 'villain', 'sequel', 'once', 'again', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'show', 'eccentric', 'pioneer', 'suprisingly', 'very', 'much', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'good', 'movie', 'really', 'However', 'think', 'what', 'found', 'subpar', 'was', 'tried', 'make', 'man', 'steel', 'vulnerable', 'emotional', 'character', 'original', 'films', 'made', 'character', 'icon', 'character', 'weaknesses', 'could', 'overcome', 'anything', 'mean', 'sure', 'hero', 'journey', 'there', 'must', 'always', 'be', 'adversity', 'main', 'character', 'needs', 'overcome', 'order', 'plot', 'work', 'reason', 'just', 'never', 'saw', 'Superman', 'complex', 'character', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'was', 'bad', 'make', 'Superman', 'more', 'complex', 'fact', 'saw', 'replica', 'original', 'nothing', 'new', 'offer', 'then', ""'d"", 'be', 'trashing', 'movie', 'really', 'liked', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'blown', 'away', 'were', 'expecting', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'offer', 'anything', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'other', 'superhero', 'movies', 'still', 'think', 'Spider-Man', 'film', 'franchise', 'beat', 'genre', 'technical', 'side', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'CGI', 'work', 'was', 'breathtaking', 'very', 'detailed', 'heard', 'lot', 'people', 'complain', 'length', 'movie', 'never', 'found', 'drag', 'great', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'enough', 'make', 'anticpate', 'next', 'installment', 'franchise.ACTING', 'Newcomer', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'perfect', 'fit', 'character', 'acting', 'was', 'not', 'stilted', 'dull', 'really', 'added', 'great', 'depth', 'character', 'had', 'lots', 'great', 'stuff', 'work', 'though', 'definately', 'helped', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'felt', 'incredibly', 'cold', 'character', 'was', 'mad', 'Superman', 'turn', 'made', 'mad', 'everyone', 'else', 'even', 'son', 'fiance', 'was', 'warmth', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'made', 'romance', 'feel', 'very', 'dull', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'show', 'amazing', 'job', 'power', 'hungry', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'who', 'grow', 'own', 'continent', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'times', 'thought', 'overpowered', 'Superman', 'character', 'thought', 'film', 'little', 'well.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'definately', 'crafted', 'well', 'made', 'superhero', 'movie', 'when', 'superhero', 'movie', 'theater', 'almost', 'few', 'months', 'sometimes', 'well', 'made', 'not', 'enough', 'only', 'problem', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'played', 'safe', 'did', ""n't"", 'change', 'that', 'much', 'example', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'completely', 'reinvented', 'franchise', 'gave', 'completely', 'fresh', 'new', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'great', ""'ve"", 'seen']",N/A

I'd been reluctant to see it because despite how old they are, I'm a big fan of the original Chrstopher Reeve movies not to mention I'd heard they paired Lois off with somebody else and hated the very idea. Still, the rest of my family was going. So, reluctantly, I went, thinking that they probably had messed the movie mythology up beyond repair. Surprise! Wrong. First a link to the old movies, then...""Hey! Isn't that music kind of familiar?"" I was grinning before the first actor ever came on screen. And I'd seen Kevin Spacey on other movies; he never suggested to me the Lex Luthor type. Guess what? He did even better than Gene Hackman (if THAT is possible)! Luthor has a feel of realism that makes you see how dangerous he really is. Kate Bosworth, probably not the Mommy type, plays the transformed Lois Lane with understated skill(c'mon folks, cut her some slack). And last but definitely not least, when I got my first good look at Superman, I was stunned enough to wonder whether Christopher Reeve had a son, younger brother, or even a cousin who was in acting! Then I wondered if maybe they made Brandon Routh up to look like Reeve so old-time fans would take the change well, but not so. And I think it was a smart move to take up where the second Reeve movie left off(though I'm one of the few who actually liked the other two also). It opened the door to a lot of potentially juicy developments.The mood of the movie manages to be kind of tragic, bittersweet and optimistic at the same time which actually fits the story of Superman to a tee. And in direct contradiction to many reviewers' opinions, I think that a young cast is a good thing. To me it means SEQUELS(how bad can that be if Bryan Singer stays on as director?)! It means that the actors will have a chance to continue to make the characters their own.Still I guess it's only fair to also note any shortcomings. I hated the new suit; they should have stuck with the one Chris Reeve wore or at least something similar. The cape looks plastic! You know, like rain slicker material. And the imfamous symbol on his chest? Also plastic. Plus the colors were all off; so dark that the red looks maroon. If the bright colors didn't look stupid before, why should they now? It's not out of style to learn from the past. Oh, and it's pretty pathetic the way they keep comparing Superman to Jesus Christ as Savior. There is just no contest between saving someone's earthly life and saving their eternal, everlasting soul.So anyway, pet peeves stated.

And it looks like we can blame Marlon Brando for being stupid enough to ask for $100 million to make a 2-minute cameo the first time around, radiating enough star power to have that bid accepted and then dying, and Christopher Reeve for doing so well in tryouts, then turning himself into a real-life hero and subsequently dying.

The whole theater was filled with the sounds of the audience screaming and crying and gasping and applauding, the way very few movie experiences inspire one to do.  Afterwards we just lay there flattened out as though run over by a bulldozer or after the pleasures of orgasm.  Of the 3-D sequences, the last is disappointing after the second and third, which are visceral, passionate, full-bodied film-making.  The first one is just Superboy learning to fly, and then Clark of the present remembering himself as a boy on Jonathan and Martha's farm way back when.Kevin Spacey, who I don't llike in general, was great in this and well worth every penny, but Parker Posey, who must have been somewhat cheaper, was just as good, making you wonder if stars are really needed in these big ticket blockbuster.  If you ask me, Kate Bosworth wasn't old enough to play Lois properly, or to play anyone with a child, her anorexic body doesn't seem developed enough to have given birth in the past, especially to a little boy who might actually be a super-baby.  Bosworth tries hard, but she's simply miscast, they might have found someone 25 or 30 to play the part.  She's got something, and the more I got into the picture I found her screen chemistry with Brandon Rotuh fairly overpowering, but at the end of the day she just was too young.  Maybe in the sequel, if they maake a sequel.What about it, Warner Brothers?  You might be disappointed with the box office returns, but millions of fans have seen the film and most of us have loved it!  We'd see another if you let Bryan Singer do it again.  Okay, maybe the little boy was kind of an ugly tyke, with that messy hair he didn't look like the little rich boy he was supposed to be playing, but some kind of savage from Appalachia or somewhere where they don't have hair scissors.

1023536,AATS9Q7VJ4PFI,B000J10EQU,Kevin R. Austra,"[2, 4]","Great special effects herald the return of Krypton's sole surviving son.Superman returns, thus the title, to Earth after a five-year sabatical in search for the remnants of his homeworld.  Despite his absence mankind survives and is still in need of his unique skills.  Lois Lane however, moved on with her life.  Unfortunately Superman's intergalactic search for his roots and inadvertant failure to show up in court provided Lex Luther a legal loophole to exit prison.  Thus we have our two stories with Superman coming to grips with Lois' new relationship and Lex Luther's plot to finally do away with Superman.One of the best things about SUPERMAN RETURNS is that there are very blatant nods to SUPERMAN and SUPERMAN II numerous times during the film.  However, the references to the earlier stories are done in a manner that would easily be recognized by fans of the Christopher Reeve films, but not make a new audience feel as if something was missed in not seeing the first two movies.  A few examples: Superman's Fortress of Solitude is similar to the sets we came to know in 1978 and 1981.  A reference is also made by Lex Luther's tag-along that it appeared that Luther had been to Superman's retreat before.  We have Marlon Brando's dialogue from the first film.  The meteorite from Addis Ababa.  Throughout the picture we also find numerous line-by-line reiterations of dialogue from 1978's SUPERMAN.  Finally, if you recall in SUPERMAN II Lois and Superman's relationship reached its apex and they were officially a couple, that is, until Clark Kent erased Lois' memory of the affair.Kevin Spacey's Lex Luther is a much better villain than Gene Hagman's earlier character.  Though RETURNS' Luther has the same fondness for real estate as his predecessor, this Luther is just plain mean.  With Luther, as with most super villains, the question always presents itself as to why a person who has everything he could possibly insist on having more.Brandon Routh is good as Superman, though he does appear a tad young for this film's scenario whereby Superman has already spent several prior years in Metropolis as Clark Kent.  Routh benefits in the fact that he could easily double as Christopher Reeve's younger brother.Gone are Frank Langella's days as dark-haired Dracula.  He is not quite the Perry White with whom we have grown accustomed, but he does a commendable job.Also, look for television's original Jimmy Olsen, Jack Larson, as the bartender.SUPERMAN RETURNS is superior to the original 1970s and 1980s films in terms of special effects, story continuity, and above all else the fact that RETURNS portrays the comic book super hero in a serious light.  Earlier directors Richard Donner and Richard Lester (more so with Lester) treated the movies as a light comedy.  Though Christopher Reeve was perfect as Superman, the supporting characters and screenplay were too silly.  Unlike televison ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN George Reeves' portrayal of Clark Kent as a tough as nails reporter, Christopher Reeve's Kent was an exaggerated bumbling nerd.  Worse yet was that in the original films, much like the BATMAN sequels, there were so many things going on that that the story was lost.  Scenes jumped from one to another without explanation or any logical transition.  The only constant was that the conclusion of the movie would find Superman soaring over the earth and smiling at the camera.SUPERMAN RETURNS' only shortcoming is that the end of the film drones on for want of something to happen.  Some of the storyline smacks of the 1990s DC Comics about the death of Superman.  In fact, so much attention is devoted to the question as to whether Superman lives or dies that the original story is almost forgotten.Still, this is hopefully the beginning of a new Superman franchise.  By the way, Superman again soars over the Earth and smiles at the camera.",4,Overdue Continuation of the Man of Steel Franchise,1173052800,"03 5, 2007",2007,3875,"['Great', 'special', 'effects', 'herald', 'return', 'Krypton', 'sole', 'surviving', 'son.Superman', 'returns', 'thus', 'title', 'Earth', 'five-year', 'sabatical', 'search', 'remnants', 'homeworld', 'absence', 'mankind', 'survives', 'still', 'need', 'unique', 'skills', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'however', 'moved', 'life', 'Unfortunately', 'Superman', 'intergalactic', 'search', 'roots', 'inadvertant', 'failure', 'show', 'up', 'court', 'provided', 'Lex', 'Luther', 'legal', 'loophole', 'exit', 'prison', 'Thus', 'have', 'two', 'stories', 'Superman', 'coming', 'grips', 'Lois', 'new', 'relationship', 'Lex', 'Luther', 'plot', 'finally', 'do', 'away', 'Superman.One', 'best', 'things', 'SUPERMAN', 'RETURNS', 'are', 'very', 'blatant', 'nods', 'SUPERMAN', 'SUPERMAN', 'II', 'numerous', 'times', 'film', 'However', 'references', 'earlier', 'stories', 'are', 'done', 'manner', 'would', 'easily', 'be', 'recognized', 'fans', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'films', 'not', 'make', 'new', 'audience', 'feel', 'something', 'was', 'missed', 'not', 'seeing', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'few', 'examples', 'Superman', 'Fortress', 'Solitude', 'similar', 'sets', 'came', 'know', '1978', '1981', 'reference', 'also', 'made', 'Lex', 'Luther', 'tag-along', 'appeared', 'Luther', 'had', 'been', 'Superman', 'retreat', 'before', 'have', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'dialogue', 'first', 'film', 'meteorite', 'Addis', 'Ababa', 'picture', 'also', 'find', 'numerous', 'line-by-line', 'reiterations', 'dialogue', '1978', 'SUPERMAN', 'Finally', 'recall', 'SUPERMAN', 'II', 'Lois', 'Superman', 'relationship', 'reached', 'apex', 'were', 'officially', 'couple', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'erased', 'Lois', 'memory', 'affair.Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Lex', 'Luther', 'much', 'better', 'villain', 'Gene', 'Hagman', 'earlier', 'character', 'RETURNS', 'Luther', 'same', 'fondness', 'real', 'estate', 'predecessor', 'Luther', 'just', 'plain', 'mean', 'Luther', 'most', 'super', 'villains', 'question', 'always', 'why', 'person', 'who', 'everything', 'could', 'possibly', 'insist', 'having', 'more.Brandon', 'Routh', 'good', 'Superman', 'appear', 'tad', 'young', 'film', 'scenario', 'whereby', 'Superman', 'already', 'spent', 'several', 'prior', 'years', 'Metropolis', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Routh', 'benefits', 'fact', 'could', 'easily', 'double', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'younger', 'brother.Gone', 'are', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'days', 'dark-haired', 'Dracula', 'not', 'quite', 'Perry', 'White', 'whom', 'have', 'grown', 'accustomed', 'commendable', 'job.Also', 'look', 'television', 'original', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'Jack', 'Larson', 'bartender.SUPERMAN', 'RETURNS', 'superior', 'original', '1970s', '1980s', 'films', 'terms', 'special', 'effects', 'story', 'continuity', 'else', 'fact', 'RETURNS', 'comic', 'book', 'super', 'hero', 'serious', 'light', 'Earlier', 'directors', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'Richard', 'Lester', 'more', 'so', 'Lester', 'treated', 'movies', 'light', 'comedy', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'was', 'perfect', 'Superman', 'supporting', 'characters', 'screenplay', 'were', 'too', 'silly', 'televison', 'ADVENTURES', 'OF', 'SUPERMAN', 'George', 'Reeves', 'portrayal', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'tough', 'nails', 'reporter', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'Kent', 'was', 'exaggerated', 'bumbling', 'nerd', 'Worse', 'yet', 'was', 'original', 'films', 'much', 'BATMAN', 'sequels', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'going', 'story', 'was', 'lost', 'Scenes', 'jumped', 'one', 'explanation', 'logical', 'transition', 'only', 'constant', 'was', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'would', 'find', 'Superman', 'soaring', 'earth', 'smiling', 'camera.SUPERMAN', 'RETURNS', 'only', 'shortcoming', 'end', 'film', 'drones', 'want', 'something', 'happen', 'storyline', 'smacks', '1990s', 'DC', 'Comics', 'death', 'Superman', 'fact', 'so', 'much', 'attention', 'devoted', 'question', 'Superman', 'original', 'story', 'almost', 'forgotten.Still', 'hopefully', 'beginning', 'new', 'Superman', 'franchise', 'way', 'Superman', 'again', 'Earth', 'smiles', 'camera']",N/A
1023537,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000J10EQU,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[3, 5]","When I first saw the previews for ""Superman Returns,"" I got really nostalgic for the ""Superman"" I remember seeing while I grew up, Christopher Reeve.  I even went out and bought first the Reeve flick just so I could refresh myself on that movie and introduce my daughter to Reeve's version of the hero.  I knew that director Bryan Singer and his crew would have a tough row to hoe considering how loved Reeve has been since donning the red cape and blue tights.  I was even hoping at one point to be let down by this new vision of one of the world's most famous superheroes.Instead, I saw a film that pays homage not only to Christopher Reeve's ""Superman,"" but also to the old serial starring George Reeves that most of my generation and definitely these young kids today haven't seen or heard of.  Singer takes great care of forming newcomer Brandon Routh's version of Superman into a completely new being with a consistent nostalgic nod to those in the role before him.  Granted, some liberties are taken with the character, but they don't take away from the mythos of the original comic hero.The story goes like this:  Superman, after finding out that astronomers think they have located his home planet of Kryptonite, heads off to see it for himself.  He returns five years later and empty-handed, not finding what he is looking for.  Almost immediately, he begins doing what he always did:  fight for truth, justice, and the American way.  Some quibble over a line delivered in the film that refers to ""truth, justice, and all that stuff"" as being unpatriotic, but I felt that the line was rendered in a fashion that didn't take away from the ""American way.""  Besides, real fans of Superman know that he is definitely for the American way, no matter who tries to make him politically correct.  Anyway, while saving the planet as usual, Supe's old foe, Lex Luthor, is once again planning to take over the world, Lois Lane is engaged and has a young son, and Jimmy Olsen is still full of giddy, childlike innocence and ignorance.Routh was perfectly cast as the Man of Steel.  He has a look that harkens back to Christopher Reeve, but manages to make the character his own.  Kate Bosworth has received a lot of flack for being cast as Lois Lane, but she, much like everyone else in this flick, had some very big shoes to fill.  I miss Margot Kidder's raspy, sassy Lois, but Bosworth does a wonderful job no less.  I also longed to see Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor, but Kevin Spacey is sinisterly devious in his execution of the role.  Much like in the older ""Superman"" flicks, Luthor delivers some of the funniest lines and relishes in his wickedness.  Sam Huntington is game as Jimmy Olsen, though his role is considerably smaller than everybody else's in this flick.  Frank Langella and James Marsden play father and son, Perry and Richard White.  Richard is engaged to Lois, and although Superman is a little miffed about this, he doesn't linger on it long once he realizes that Richard is a decent and caring man.  Parker Posey plays Kitty Kowalski.  She's no Valerie Perrine, but she has enough goofy charm to steal plenty of thunder from Spacey's Luthor during the film.  There will never be another Otis, performed originally by Ned Beatty, but Kal Penn (Harold and Kumar Go To Whitecastle) is the only recognizable member of a gaggle of thugs that Luthor keeps with him.  Few words are spoken amongst the group, but they have a very intense sequence in the film when they meet up with Superman.Singer was careful not to offend fans of the older versions of ""Superman,"" maintaining the goofy charm of Clark Kent and the ""big boy scout"" quips by Superman such as nagging Lois about smoking.  He spent a lot of time allowing us to see Superman in flight, giving the audience a healthy dose of trips into outerspace, skimming the ocean with Lois, and catching falling victims in mid-air.  He also pumped up Supe's eye beams, putting them to frequent, and visually fun, use.  We get to check out the X-ray vision, outrunning speeding bullets, stopping speeding bullets, and even a cool flight through fire.Much like Sam Raimi with the ""Spiderman"" films, I feel that Bryan Singer was truly the best choice for taking command of a project like ""Superman Returns.""  He obviously loves the character, and respects the old TV shows, movies, and the comics.  This movie was much better than I ever expected and looks to be a very solid beginning to a new series of ""Superman"" flicks.  Hopefully Singer will be able to make more of these films and give them the treatment they deserve.  He managed to make a superhero flick with heart, and that's a hard thing to do these days considering the ease of CGI use.  Most directors, as did Brett Ratner with the latest ""X-Men"" installment, dump storyline for action sequences.  Singer serves up plenty of both in this latest entry into the comic movie world.I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a great story, light humor, and plenty of action.  Also, for all of you Christopher Reeve fans out there who think you shouldn't tamper with perfection, just know that ""Superman Returns"" realizes where it came from and does justice to the past.",4,A

1023539,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000J10EQU,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[5, 5]","I came into ""Superman Returns"" with moderate expectations.  I'm not one of those people who have been yearning for the revitalization of the franchise.  The original ""Superman"" with Christopher Reeves was a good movie all but destroyed by one of the biggest ""cheat"" endings in film history.  I hated it when I was a kid, and I still hate that ending--heck, if you can turn back time, it really negates all drama.  ""Superman 2,"" however, was more to my liking--good villains and a nice mix of romance and comedy.  And the less said about the other films in the series, the better.So, ""Superman Returns"" was a very pleasant surprise.  While still retaining the innocence and cheesiness of tone, the tale has been updated with modern day sensibilities.  Starting five years after ""Superman 2""--everyone has moved on in Superman's absence.  Most notably, Lois has a new man and a child.  But not to dwell on the plot, let's just say that it's brisk and amusing.  There are some nice action set pieces--the most memorable being Superman saving a doomed airliner.  I saw this film on the IMAX screen and this was most definitely a highlight in 3D.  And I really enjoyed the way elements of the original film (Brando, anyone?) are incorporated into the film's framework.Brandon Routh does a fine job filling the shoes of steel.  Kate Bosworth is surprisingly effective--oh, but why does she have to be so neglectful of Clark?  James Marsden actually has a much better role here than in the final ""X-Men""--what a disappointing send off he got there.  As Lois's other man, he is a credible alternative to Superman as a romantic lead.  One of the pleasures of the film is that he's a fully fleshed out and worthy rival--not a boob or a villain!  And Kevin Spacey and Parker Posey have a grand time overplaying the villains--it's especially good to see Posey in a major film.The success of ""Superman Returns"" is that it honestly develops the relationships--there is a real emotional resonance, real longing, real passion.

Compared to Batman Begins, Spiderman and even the first X-Men, this film's narrative is shy of the new standard and even less than Superman the Movie (Donner, 1978), but his message of hope, salvation, and redemption is more developed and prevalent.The movie's technical accomplishments are great.  Unlike the other Superman movies, in this one you really will believe a man can fly.  Singer, produces a messianic  film where Superman resembles Jesus (There has always been a strong Superman Moses theme, but Singer goes even further).  This helps us to see an internal struggle that Superman faces: His love for humankind and in both his super (divine form) and in his life in relationships (human form).  This is a nice and wanted experiment; but, the movie does not quite get there.Why? The story at times falters.  Its long enough to flesh out the material, but the script could have been stronger.  Further, Routh (Superman), Bosworth (Lois), and Spacey (Luther) all fall short in tehir performances.  For Routh and Spacey, part of the problem is that they are compared to the spectacular performances of Reeve and Hackmen from Donner's Superman.  Bosworth just does not pull Lois off at all.  Kidder did a fine job as Lois, compare to Bosworth, it deserves an academy award.  When she tries to appear ""spunky"", she instead appears obstinate.Overall, the movie deserves four stars, although I wanted to give it five.

I thought that Bryan Singer did a great job in his attempt to be true to the first 2 original Superman films, as well as to the Superman mythology.  I've heard several complaint about the romantic aspects of the film, but I've seen it a couple times and I wouldn't cut any of it.  It's important to reastablish the Superman/Lois Lane relationship.  THe actors all do a fine job in their roles, Routh does a great job as both the man of steel and as Clark Kent, and Kevin Spacy is malevolent as Lex Luther, but he can't seem to find the right balance between Hackman's more campy version and the malevolence that Singer looked for.  Kate Bosworth has great chemistry with Routh for the whole Lois Lane, but she doesn't seem as confortable in the role as the other actors do in theirs.  Marsden is great as Richard White, while the other characters for the most part have bit parts.  Parker Posey as Kitty is entertaining.  Now the not so good.  1) Both Routh and Bosworth are too young to be the ages they're supposed to be.  Both of them appear to be more in their early to mid twenties as opposed to late 20's early 30's.  2) In order for Lois Lane and Superman to have a child and for Lois to know Jason's paternity, she would have to remember all the events of Superman II which Superman wiped out with his super-memory powers at the end of that movie.  3) Once again the whole Lois and Clark dynamic is missed.  Clark Kent and Lois Lane are supposed to be friends as well as reporting partners and none of the movies can capture that dynamic.  At one point Clark says to Lois ""I don't want this to damage out relationship."" and Lois quizically looks at him and says ""Relationship?"".  In the comics and the Superman mythology, Clark and Lois have a dynamic, I hope by the next movie, that dynamic is found because it makes Clark Kent a very one-dimensional character.

1023546,A242H31I2UZ2QX,B000J10EQU,"K ""K""","[19, 57]","In the new Bryan Singer movie, Superman returns after a five-year absence and discovers a world that's changed -- symbolized perhaps most powerfully by a Pulitzer Prize-winning article written by Lois Lane and sporting the title ""Why the World Doesn't Need a Superman.""And, boy, has she hit the nail on the head.While the film could have taken a look at the things Superman is powerless to stop, from global warming to civil wars, government corruption to battles for oil and weapons of mass destruction, it instead focuses solely on the Last Son of Krypton's personal pain dealing with a world in which a drab and uninteresting Lois Lane--Kate Bosworth--has a new fiance, a son born out of wedlock, and a pal named Jimmy Olsen who is so useless, he can't even take a good picture.You will believe a man can fly...and that he can break the sound barrier and do battle with the laws of physics in ways never anticipated or considered in previous superhero flicks.  He WILL amaze you.Watching Superman fly into space to listen for trouble is a wondrous moment.  You'll be astounded watching him save both a space shuttle and an airplane. You'll smile gleefully when he takes Lois on her first flight in at least five years as Brandon Routh fills the boots and cape of Christopher Reeve admirably.  As a new, young actor he doesn't have the chops Reeve had, but he may get there by the time a sequel comes around.Lois's incessant whininess and bitterness may not solely be the fault of Bosworth, as this is not your mother's Lois Lane -- Margot Kidder's Lois took on armed purse snatchers, punched-out super villainesses from Krypton and was able to leap underneath an elevator in the Eiffel Tower in a single bound.  While today's Lois takes a load of beatings without even smudging her lipstick (perhaps she's got a little Superman in her), she's not the plucky independent woman of yore -- she can't even hail a taxicab on her own.  What kind of city girl is THAT?!Kevin Spacey's fun Hackmanesque performance as the treacherous Lex Luthor is a clear homage to the 1978 Richard Donner film, and it's not the only one: from static on a radio signaling Superman's return (reminiscent of the static caused by a magical green crystal in ""Superman: The Movie"") to a shot of three people trapped behind a glass door (think of the three Kryptonian villains and their oddly shaped prison flying through space); from lines and music cues lifted from that first movie to a small I.D. tag reading ""Addis Ababa"" (where Lex first discovered Kryptronite) to the dedication to Christopher and Dana Reeve at the end.  But while homage is great, there is one very important thing this film missed: the joy of Superman.This joy is something not overlooked by the people who had brought us ""Lois & Clark: The Nrew Adventures of Superman,"" ""Smallville,""--the story of a teenage Clark Kent--and even the syndicated ""Superboy""--the less-sophisticated tights-'n'-cape version of ""Smallville.""Those other incarnations of Superman have their faults, but the success of each shows what a powerful force Superman is in popular culture.  We have all seen a lot of big blockbuster movies -- terminators and spider-men, guys in bat outfits and stories of famous ships, historical figures, fictional gods, and well-known battles of this world's past -- but none of them, in my experience, elicited the complete and total silence, the utter anticipation, this movie did when the credits began.The audience was as silent as if they were in prayer.And they were silent when the movie let out -- wondering why they hadn't prayed for a better script.I'm going to pinpoint the moment this film loses it's way (don't worry, no spoilers):  Superman performs a host of heroics throughout the city of Metropolis that will leave you breathless and then, just as the movie gets going (despite some hauntingly disturbing moments that will have New Yorkers remembering 9/11), Superman leaves Metropolis to go tackle Lex.Both Superman and the movie go out to sea. Until this turn of events, the movie was bordering on Magical.When all is said and done, you don't even get The Moment -- that big moment when you want to cheer as Superman defeats the bad guy. It simply isn't there, because he never does.The film merely gets dark and it gets mean. It becomes grim and perilous, and all for no reason, with no real consequence. As, if you're going to venture into true anger and hatred and death and darkness...in the end, someone had better have learned something about themselves and/or the world.And nobody does.The needless grim and peril is in part accomplished by putting the life of a young child in danger.  Sure, some fantastic contemporary films have put children in peril, but they've succeeded because of their ability to do so with a sense of fun (""Spy Kids"") or a sense of realism (""Stand By Me""); when it's done wrong, it's unforgivable (""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" [which, personally, I loved]; ""Dennis the Menace"").  There is nothing ""super"" about a child almost dying just minutes after watching his mom barely escape from a beating that put her in mortal danger -- even when there is a ""Super"" payoff.And Superman the new movie never quite crawls out of the mire after that.Our hero performs one more super-feat once the boy doesn't quite die, but there are no stand-up-and-cheer moments like those that Richard Donner gave us.  Where was the ""You've got me?  Who's got you?"" as Reeve's Superman saves both Lois Lane and a crowd on the street from a falling helicopter?  You'll find no shock and awe as when the '70s Superman burrows to the Earth's core and fixes the California fault line, and then turns the world back to save Lois Lane (whether you bought it or not). And you don't get to enjoy any real sense that Luthor's received his comeuppance (his punishment is not brought about by the Man of Steel, and is paltry at best).And then the movie ends, after a long and dreary denouement where characters go back to their lives and nothing terribly new or interesting happens -- although you think it's going to.While there are questions, such as why it took Lois five bitter years to write her Pulitzer Prize-winning article, or what Clark Kent's excuse is for being gone for so long from The Daily Planet--of which its office and characters are relegated to virtual non-entities--the biggest one remains unanswered by Lois Lane as she tries to come to terms with a world where Superman has returned.  Her new article puts forth the question of ""Why the World Still Needs Superman""...but she lacks inspiration and produces nothing but a tear and a blank page.Perhaps she can be inspired to work on the next script -- no one seemed terribly inspired to work on this one.  The ""complex"" problems of Superman come off like teenagers trying really hard to be ""deep.""  If you see it, leave just after Superman saves The Daily Planet globe from a fall and save yourself from the depressing ending.",1,"Why The World, Lois, and Moviegoers Don't Need a

1023547,AGKJF15QQNVX6,B000J10EQU,"klownboy ""klownboy""","[5, 8]","What else can you say about a franchise ""restart"" that feels, plays, and ends like a drawn out coda instead of a jubilant new beginning.  Helmer Brian Singer is handed the keys to the character that can do anything, along with 60+ years of stories to draw from, but what does he do with it?  An Oxygen network movie of the week, with almost perfunctory nods to what the character is really about.  Singer attempts to pull drama and tension from the romance of the 80's movies, but since the actual parting between the leads is never adequately explained, there is no real tension in it, nor any real drama to be had in its resolution, only the ill-defined squirming sensation that relationship sitcoms get in season 2.This genre and this character each have clich&eacute;s of their own.  Those clich&eacute;s are fundamental to making the character who he needs to be, and the stories true to that character.  The question has to be: Why do a Superman movie if you don't really want to tell a Superman story?  I am at a total loss for some the new direction taken by this movie.  A new character is introduced that has nothing to do with the established mythos, a character that will gobble plot space in any subsequent in-continuity stories.  Without giving anything away, imagine if you went into a Bond movie, and they had replaced ""M"" with a pair of CGI wisecracking dogs voiced by Robin Williams and Larry the cable guy.  It might be funny, and it might make a few bucks, but it wouldn't be a Bond movie anymore.  That's what we have here:  a story line that drifts cheaply and unnecessarily so far away from the source that it's no longer Superman.Routh and Spacey do serviceable jobs, respecting and building on the previous actors' styles while adding the touches needed for the new project, but Kate Bosworth is a total disaster.  Staggering from scene to scene with a freshly tasered junior high vibe that conveys nothing of what her character is supposed to be.  Lane, the reporter, is 30-ish, sharp, refined, sexy, accomplished, and world weary but still energetic and positive.  Bosworth comes across as 19, slow, dull, suburban, mousey, coddled, and resigned.  (Better casting would have been to put the underutilized Parker Posey in this role, but she's wasted providing paint-by-numbers comic relief.)Even the iconic outfit, a 100% no-brainer, is just wrong.  The color scheme was so bad that I had originally thought it was deliberate disinformation to throw off merchandise counterfeiters.  No such luck.  Baby blue and dark brick red:  The man of steel rendered as your grandma's basement laundry room.Off the reservation on the major plot points, tone deaf on the female lead, wrong on some obvious details, and silent on the continuity problems.  Just two or three action pieces, and a final climax that never climbs above ""OK, I pushed hard once, but now I'm REALLY pushing hard"".Worth a watch just to say you've seen it, but it's a let-down to anyone expecting a Superman movie to tell a Superman story.",2,Super Disappointing.,1182211200,"06 19, 2007",2007,3026,"['What', 'else', 'can', 'say', 'franchise', 'restart', 'plays', 'drawn', 'out', 'coda', 'instead', 'jubilant', 'new', 'beginning', 'Helmer', 'Brian', 'Singer', 'handed', 'keys', 'character', 'can', 'do', 'anything', '60+', 'years', 'stories', 'draw', 'what', 'do', 'Oxygen', 'network', 'movie', 'week', 'almost', 'perfunctory', 'nods', 'what', 'character', 'really', 'about', 'Singer', 'pull', 'drama', 'tension', 'romance', '80', 'movies', 'actual', 'parting', 'leads', 'never', 'adequately', 'explained', 'real', 'tension', 'real', 'drama', 'be', 'had', 'resolution', 'only', 'ill-defined', 'squirming', 'sensation', 'relationship', 'sitcoms', 'get', 'season', '2.This', 'genre', 'character', 'have', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'own', 'clich', 'eacute', 'are', 'fundamental', 'making', 'character', 'who', 'be', 'stories', 'true', 'character', 'question', 'be', 'Why', 'do', 'Superman', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'tell', 'Superman', 'story', 'am', 'total', 'loss', 'new', 'direction', 'taken', 'movie', 'new', 'character', 'introduced', 'nothing', 'do', 'established', 'mythos', 'character', 'will', 'gobble', 'plot', 'space', 'subsequent', 'in-continuity', 'stories', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'imagine', 'went', 'Bond', 'movie', 'had', 'replaced', 'M', 'pair', 'CGI', 'wisecracking', 'dogs', 'voiced', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Larry', 'cable', 'guy', 'might', 'be', 'funny', 'might', 'make', 'few', 'bucks', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'Bond', 'movie', 'anymore', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'story', 'line', 'drifts', 'cheaply', 'unnecessarily', 'so', 'far', 'away', 'source', 'no', 'longer', 'Superman.Routh', 'Spacey', 'do', 'serviceable', 'jobs', 'respecting', 'building', 'previous', 'actors', 'styles', 'adding', 'touches', 'needed', 'new', 'project', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'total', 'disaster', 'Staggering', 'scene', 'scene', 'freshly', 'tasered', 'junior', 'high', 'vibe', 'nothing', 'what', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'Lane', 'reporter', '30-ish', 'sharp', 'refined', 'sexy', 'accomplished', 'world', 'weary', 'still', 'energetic', 'positive', 'Bosworth', '19', 'slow', 'dull', 'suburban', 'mousey', 'coddled', 'resigned', 'Better', 'casting', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'underutilized', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'role', 'wasted', 'providing', 'paint-by-numbers', 'comic', 'relief', 'Even', 'iconic', 'outfit', '100', '%', 'no-brainer', 'just', 'wrong', 'color', 'scheme', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'had', 'originally', 'thought', 'was', 'deliberate', 'disinformation', 'throw', 'off', 'merchandise', 'counterfeiters', 'such', 'luck', 'Baby', 'blue', 'dark', 'brick', 'red', 'man', 'steel', 'rendered', 'grandma', 'basement', 'laundry', 'reservation', 'major', 'plot', 'points', 'tone', 'deaf', 'female', 'lead', 'wrong', 'obvious', 'details', 'silent', 'continuity', 'problems', 'Just', 'two', 'three', 'action', 'pieces', 'final', 'climax', 'never', 'climbs', 'OK', 'pushed', 'hard', 'once', 'now', ""'m"", 'REALLY', 'pushing', 'hard', 'watch', 'just', 'say', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'let-down', 'anyone', 'expecting', 'Superman', 'movie', 'tell', 'Superman', 'story']",N/A

Lex wants own the world and starts creating a new continent; Lois is on his trail, and Superman is after her.Brandon Routh is very good as Superman, mainly because he looks a lot like Christopher Reeve.  He's a beautiful man and does a fine job, especially as Clark Kent.  Unfortunately, he's given little dialogue.  I thought Bosworth and Spacey were both miscast.  His gloomy Luthor is also a man of (too) few words, and he's lethargic and boring to boot.  Bosworth looks like a glamorous 20-year old model and lacks the wonderful awkwardness that made Margot Kidder's Lois so endearing.  Even boy photographer Jimmy Olson and editor Perry White look wrong.  They should provide a little humor, but are bland and forgettable instead.  The film has so much computer-animation that nothing feels real.  There is no romance or sense of danger.

1023550,AR3HV5WH2I4B2,B000J10EQU,"Kristopher KR ""Um, yeah.""","[2, 4]","In a word: Awesome.Maybe it's corny or cheesy that as a 30 year old father that I still get a kick out of Superman.  I don't care.  Superman is the ultimate outcast, so anyone can relate with him.Superman Returns is a labor of love for the director, Bryan Singer (X-Men, The Usual Suspects), and you can tell. First off, from the beginning, the movie begins with the same classic see-thru blue font that comes towards you with a sweeping woosh sound.  Secondly, the newest Superman takes place as if Superman III (with the late Richard Pryor) and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (with...huge superstar Mark Pillow) never happened.Superman decides to leave Earth behind after astronomers thought they discovered remnants of his former home planet Krypton.  He felt the need for closure and self discovery.After a five year hiatus, Superman/Clark Kent return to Smallville and Metropolis, reuniting with his old friends and bosses like Jimmy Olsen and Perry White. Jimmy is the same scrawny pipsqueak that has more naievety than guston.  Perry White is all business, all the time.Then there's the lovely Lois Lane.  Clark/Superman's former love has since moved on with her life, now dating her bosses nephew with a young boy in tow.  Lois is bitter that Superman left, so much so she's written an entire article of denial for the Daily Planet that wins a Pulitzer Prize.However, once Superman shows his face again, all the weakness of the knees come flowing back and she must make a choice between White's nephew and Superman.All the while, Lex Luthor (played by Kevin Spacey), has gotten out of jail legally and weaseled his way into money.  He quickly hatches a plan to create an entire continet so that he can not only make billions of dollars, but seemingly take over the world.Let me just say that this movie is awesome for so many reasons.  The music is classic, and the music is always an essential part of a good film.  The effects, both sound and visual were nothing short of impressive.  Throughout the experience, I felt the need to inch towards the edge of my seat and clench my fists in excitement.  Everyone knows Superman will get things done, but the ride that ensues on the way to victory is the roller coaster you come to watch.The acting could not have been better.  Newcomer Brandon Routh plays Clark Kent and Superman as if he's the second coming of the late Christopher Reeve.  He's bold, strong, clumsy, funny, and everything Superman portrays.Kate Bosworth portrays Lois Lane with a lot more spunk than Margot Kidder of the original movies.  Lois Lane, due to the disappearance of Superman, has had to become a stronger woman not only for herself, but for her son and, in my opinion, felt the world needed her to be.Kevin Spacey's Lex Luthor is a hard, cold, very mean version of Gene Hackman's version.  While Hackman's role allowed him to be comically evil with Ned Beatty at his side as his slapstick right hand man. Spacey's Luthor shows off the true spirit of jealousy and greed that drive Lex to attempt taking over the world, desperately searching for the weakness of the one man that can stop him.Overall, needless to say, I loved Superman Returns.  It brought back memories of me running around with a cape and pretending I could fly while darting up and down the hallway.Now, with the return of Superman and the welcoming of my little buddy, whose official theme song is ""Superman Theme"" by John Williams, a whole new generation can get excited about Comic Book/Superhero movies.Watch, and enjoy!",5,Superman Returns,1166313600,"12 17, 2006",2006,3529,"['word', 'Awesome.Maybe', 'corny', 'cheesy', '30', 'year', 'old', 'father', 'still', 'get', 'kick', 'Superman', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Superman', 'ultimate', 'outcast', 'anyone', 'can', 'relate', 'him.Superman', 'Returns', 'labor', 'love', 'director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'X-Men', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'can', 'tell', 'First', 'off', 'beginning', 'movie', 'same', 'classic', 'see-thru', 'blue', 'font', 'towards', 'sweeping', 'woosh', 'sound', 'Secondly', 'newest', 'Superman', 'place', 'Superman', 'III', 'late', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'Superman', 'IV', 'Quest', 'Peace', 'huge', 'superstar', 'Mark', 'Pillow', 'never', 'happened.Superman', 'decides', 'leave', 'Earth', 'astronomers', 'thought', 'discovered', 'remnants', 'former', 'home', 'planet', 'Krypton', 'felt', 'need', 'closure', 'self', 'discovery.After', 'five', 'year', 'hiatus', 'Superman/Clark', 'Kent', 'return', 'Smallville', 'Metropolis', 'reuniting', 'old', 'friends', 'bosses', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'Perry', 'White', 'Jimmy', 'same', 'scrawny', 'pipsqueak', 'more', 'naievety', 'guston', 'Perry', 'White', 'business', 'time.Then', 'lovely', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Clark/Superman', 'former', 'love', 'moved', 'life', 'now', 'dating', 'bosses', 'nephew', 'young', 'boy', 'tow', 'Lois', 'bitter', 'Superman', 'left', 'so', 'much', 'written', 'entire', 'article', 'denial', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize.However', 'once', 'Superman', 'face', 'again', 'weakness', 'knees', 'come', 'flowing', 'back', 'must', 'make', 'choice', 'White', 'nephew', 'Superman.All', 'while', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'gotten', 'jail', 'legally', 'weaseled', 'way', 'money', 'quickly', 'plan', 'create', 'entire', 'continet', 'so', 'can', 'not', 'only', 'make', 'billions', 'dollars', 'seemingly', 'take', 'over', 'world.Let', 'just', 'say', 'movie', 'awesome', 'so', 'many', 'reasons', 'music', 'classic', 'music', 'always', 'essential', 'part', 'good', 'film', 'effects', 'sound', 'visual', 'were', 'nothing', 'short', 'impressive', 'experience', 'felt', 'need', 'inch', 'edge', 'seat', 'clench', 'fists', 'excitement', 'Everyone', 'Superman', 'will', 'get', 'things', 'done', 'ride', 'way', 'victory', 'roller', 'coaster', 'come', 'watch.The', 'acting', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Newcomer', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Superman', 'second', 'coming', 'late', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'bold', 'strong', 'clumsy', 'funny', 'everything', 'Superman', 'portrays.Kate', 'Bosworth', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'lot', 'more', 'spunk', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'original', 'movies', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'due', 'disappearance', 'Superman', 'had', 'become', 'stronger', 'woman', 'not', 'only', 'son', 'opinion', 'felt', 'world', 'needed', 'be.Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'hard', 'cold', 'very', 'mean', 'version', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'version', 'Hackman', 'role', 'allowed', 'be', 'comically', 'evil', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'side', 'slapstick', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'Spacey', 'Luthor', 'true', 'spirit', 'jealousy', 'greed', 'drive', 'Lex', 'attempt', 'taking', 'world', 'desperately', 'searching', 'weakness', 'one', 'man', 'can', 'stop', 'him.Overall', 'needless', 'say', 'loved', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'brought', 'back', 'memories', 'running', 'around', 'cape', 'pretending', 'could', 'fly', 'darting', 'up', 'hallway.Now', 'return', 'Superman', 'welcoming', 'little', 'buddy', 'official', 'theme', 'song', 'Superman', 'Theme', 'John', 'Williams', 'whole', 'new', 'generation', 'can', 'get', 'excited', 'Comic', 'Book/Superhero', 'movies.Watch', 'enjoy']",N/A
1023551,A1DWUPXRD1HN1B,B000J10EQU,Kurt Russell,"[0, 2]","There have been many atrocious films made throughout time, but none have squandered so much talent, history and money like this movie. Imagine the shock and dismay associated with watching Michael Jordan lose a one-on-one basketball game to a small child, or ordering the $100 steak at a fancy restaurant and being given a microwaved sausage patty. Because of the rich source material and squandered potential, this film is an absolute travesty. It's not just bad; it's insultingly blasphemous.The villain's plan would've been ridiculously stupid for a children's cartoon, but then it completely defies and ignores its own logic anyways (SPOILER: Make a Kryptonite island to keep Superman away... but then he lifts the whole thing up into space? But it's Kryptonite.)Superman is not a virtuous, noble hero, but rather a self-absorbed jerk/weirdo who uses his spare time and super-powers to stalk his ex-girlfriend and new family, spending the whole movie &#34;romantically&#34; being a homewrecker. So you can add &#34;offensive misogyny&#34; to the long list of vile things wrong with this film. Rarely does one ever encounter any movie that is so ethically and morally off-base, let alone one starring such an iconic hero.Then there's a kid in it. You know the kind, one that's cloying, uninteresting, whiney and flat-out annoying, the kind who is the hallmark of so-many atrocious big-budget films aping to connect with the children and shoehorned into the plot by out-of-touch executives (Phantom Menace, Iron Man 3, Last Action Hero, etc.)The action is bad, the effects are weak, the jokes are mean and unfunny, the chemistry is nonexistent, the acting flat, the length is interminable...

1023554,A2ICI500LRO01K,B000J10EQU,Kyle Wells,"[5, 9]","The Movie Making Machine that is Hollywood has always been, and will forever be, fueled artistically by the tinder of formula. Year after year, especially, although not exclusively, in the summer, audiences are subjected to the same array of remakes, sequels, prequels, literary adaptations, television spin-offs, etc. that provide safe and simple movies for audiences, and assured box-office hits for the studios. Genre lines especially dictate these formulas, and recently the fixation of Hollywood has been predominantly either cheap horror films, or big-budget superhero movies. Every year since the successes of ""X-Men"" and ""Spiderman"" Hollywood has turned out a new must-see-movie-of-the-summer superhero extravaganza. This year's offering is a (gasp) sequel to the Superman series of movies, which was last seen in 1987 with the fourth installment. ""Superman Returns"" revives the series and is reportedly one of the most expensive movies made to date, which makes one wonder why perhaps they could not have afforded some half-decent actors, a script that makes sense, and a director who knows how to make an entertaining movie.One of the first problems with the film is that the story seems almost painfully forced and, at times, even incoherent. Once past the surprisingly good opening title sequence, we learn that Superman has returned after a five year search for his home planet. What Superman found or learned on this little hiatus is never made especially clear, but what is clear is that now that he has returned, the situation and setting familiar to all Superman fans will be immediately restored. To further tie this movie to the originals, Marlon Brando's speech from the first film is resurrected here and replayed ad nauseam as a reminder of the previously established roots and morals that drive Superman. With all this character development now out of the way, thanks to one broken-record speech from twenty-five years ago, Bryan Singer can now focus on the ludicrous contemporary plot of Lex Luthor using crystals from Superman's Fortress of Solitude to create new land. How these crystals do this is unknown to me, as is how Luther was aware that they do this, but one thing is for sure, the megalomaniacal insanity of Luthor seems somewhat diminished when his evil plans for world domination come in the form of real estate development schemes. In the post-9/11, terrorism filled world we live in you would think the writers could find a perhaps more relevant and contemporary (if only by implication) scheme, but this, sadly, was not attempted. Throw in a terribly dry, does-she-love-him-or-not subplot with Lois Lane that we have seen multiple times before, and you've got the Superman of today.The only problem is that it is not a Superman for today at all. The film is nostalgia of the worst kind and offers nothing more, and perhaps considerably less, than we have seen dragged out of the Superman story time and time again. Superman is not one of the most interesting superheroes to begin with, so when an uninspired movie like this takes the story and does no more than rehash it, the result is tedium. Sure there are some exciting sequences and some impressive special effects, but these can do little for a film with characters so dry and a plot so plain that little, if any, interest can be vested in them. Singer tries to add depth through a Christ-like reading of Superman, achieved through some hit-over-the-head religious imagery, but given all the ingredients of the film this seems forced at best. Singer would do better to concentrate on entertainment first and stimulating metaphor second with a film such as this.One of the main things I took away from ""Superman Returns"" was a realization of how little interested I am in most of the young actors of Hollywood these days. Five to ten years ago the possibilities seemed fantastic as actors such as Edward Norton, Giovanni Ribisi, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and, yes, even Kevin Spacey were taking over the screens and forcing audiences to take notice of their intense, exhilarating performances. Some great actors start out hot, only to fizzle out later in their careers (Robert DeNiro anyone?), but actors now seem to start out dull from the go. As unimpressive a crew of actors I have seen stroll through the reels of ""Superman Returns"" and bring absolutely nothing to the admittedly poor material they are given. Brandon Routh may be physically impressive and easily likened to Reeves but it must be remembered here that a two-inch chin does not an actor make. Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane seemed to in fact be present and delivering her lines, but beyond that her presence is barely notable. Even Kevin Spacey, who was so brilliantly villainous in Singer's own ""The Usual Suspects"", is shockingly dull as the possibly exuberant and entertaining Luthor. Spacey could have easily stolen the movie, but apart from one playful moment (""Say it just once for me please..."") does nothing but stare blankly and occasionally role his eyes, perhaps at his own dialogue. The story is poor, but whereas some actors may have brought some life to it, this troupe sucks away any that may have remained out.Formula rules Hollywood and right now the superhero movie dominates. Like all repeatable genres, its popularity comes from some truly great films such as ""Spiderman 2"" and ""Batman Begins"" (movies I hate to love, see first paragraph), but ""Superman Returns"" is far from the cream of the crop. Watch it for Routh doing his best Reeves impression, watch it for the opening titles, watch it for the special effects, or don't watch it for all the other reasons I have given. It is one of those summer movies that could so easily have been good but instead falls flat. In fact, the more I write about it the more my disdain for it grows. It is losing stars by the sentence, so I'll quit and save what little is salvageable.",2,Formula rules in surprisingly dull film,1152835200,"07 14, 2006",2006,5902,"['Movie', 'Making', 'Machine',

1023559,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000J10EQU,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[17, 19]","First of all, if you want to do any prep work for watching ""Superman Returns,"" all you really need to see from the Christopher Reeve series is the 1978 ""Superman"" film.  All that matters from the second one is that Lex Luthor has been to Superman's Fortress of Solitude, and the third and fourth films are thankfully flushed from our cinematic memories of the Man of Steel.  However, you have another option in that director Bryan Singer, who came up with the story for the film along with screenwriters Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris, also came up with stories for four ""Returns Prequel"" comic books, entitled ""Krypton to Earth,"" ""Ma Kent,"" Lex Luthor,"" and ""Lois Lane.""  They work in most of the key elements from the ""Superman"" film that matter here.  I have seen several similar comic book prequels, but these are by far the best, reminding us of why Jor-el sent his only son to Earth, and showing us that the world misses Superman but Martha Kent misses her son, how Lex hooked up with Kitty, and why Lois Lane wrote her editorial ""Why the World Doesn't Need Superman.""Still, even if you have not seen that ""Superman"" recently you will probably recognize a lot of the elements from that film that have made their way in this summer's big blockbuster.  In fact there are so many that there are points where you wonder if ""Superman Returns"" is more of a remake than it is a sequel. Lois still cannot spell and still tries to sneak a cigarette, while Superman still saves her, still takes her flying, and is even telling the same jokes as before.  They are still using John Williams' theme music, but that would be a good thing to keep from the first movie.  Fortunately, there are some significant new things to go with the borrowed and the blue (suit).What happened was that when astronomers discovered a planet that could be Krypton, Superman decided he had to travel there to see what happened to his home world.  Five years have passed and before Superman returns it is Clark Kent (Brandon Routh) who comes back to the Daily Planet to find things are different.  Mainly, that Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) has two new men in her life, Richard White (James Marsden), the nephew of Perry White (Frank Langella) and an associate editor at the Daily Planet, and their son, Jason (Tristan Lake Leabu), who is, interestingly enough, about five years old.  Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey), is out of prison, thanks in part to the absence of Superman, and with help from Kitty Kowalski (Parker Posey), gets his hands on some items from Krypton that will make him rich and help him kill Superman.The bottom line is that ""Superman Returns"" is better than we expected, which is impressive given how high our expectations where for this film.  I was rather surprised how easily I was willing to accept that Routh was Superman, but he has the attitude down pat.  He tones down both parts from what we saw with Christopher Reeve, but that makes sense given what he spent the last five years doing, even if he does not look like he is five years older.  Bosworth is a much more solid Lois Lane and they really should have ditched the spelling and smoking bits.  Spacey picks up where he left off the last time he played a bald character (i.e., ""Seven""), and makes Lex lethal this time around (plus props for having his credit last so the name of the guy who plays Superman comes first).  But for me the standout character in the movie is Marsden's Richard White, because this guy is good enough for Lois and a hero in his own right in this movie.  This was rather surprising, but a key reason why the movie works.  The character they needed to ditch or rewrite was Posey's Kitty, who is a rehashed Miss Teschmacher, which is not what these movie needed (any more than bringing back Otis).  There is enough comedy that works in this film without needing anybody other than Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) as the comic relief.There are several treats for fans of Superman in all of his myriad incarnations.  Noel Neill, who was Lois Lane on television's ""The Adventures of Superman"" and Young Lois Lane's mother (on the train) in the 1978 movie, plays Gertrude Vanderworth, Lex Luther's benefactress, while Jack Larson, who played Jimmy Olson on the series, is Bo the Bartender.  The end credits mention the memories of Christopher Reeve and Dana Reeve, but the best homage to his memory (and there are a lot in this film) is when Singer repeats the bit where Superman is flying in space and right before he flies out of the frame he looks into the camera and smiles at us.  That was the quintessential shot of Reeve as Superman.  Just like Jor-el, Marlon Brandon proves that death is not a deterrent and I have to add that while there are some pretty emotional scenes at the end of this one, I flashed on what could have been a fantastic scene between Lois and Martha Kent (Eva Marie Saint) in the last act that would have blown everybody completely away.  But, hey, boys and girls, that is why they make sequels and as long as they ink Singer and this cast and stick to the archetypal vision of Superman, Warner Bros. could have a franchise that will rival Spider-Man (bet they air the trailer for ""Spider-Man III"" everywhere they show ""Superman Returns"").",5,"Superman returns.

I was wrong.Brendan Routh flows into the title role as close as possible to Christopher Reeve, to maintain continuity, and not introduce a delay in our reconnecting with the movie Superman.Two shots in one scene recreate and pay homage to the Joe Shuster illustration, the most famous Superman drawing, from the cover of Action Comics #1.On the radio Superman of 1940-1950, Bud Collyer, lacking the benefit of images, played Clark in a higher voice and Superman in a lower, as in ""this looks like a job--FOR SUPERMAN!"" So did this movie, but more subtly.The artists behind this movie made a creative decision about the cape: It was less red overall, dark red on the outside, brighter on the inside, presumably so it would not dominate action visuals.Another creative decision involves the little boy, but I won 't give that away. It does point the way to some new directions in this obvious Part I of the New Superman Cinema Serials.We know how Kal-El landed on Earth. This movie gives us Clark's return as a rebirth paralleling his original arrival here.Superman doesn't always fly/float in the movie. Sometimes his knee is bent as in the fly/leap drawings that went from inception through the eighties. Another homage.And this one too: In the best Luthor stories of the early forties, when he was an ""evil scientist,"" Luthor wore a long robe, as drawn brilliantly by John SIkela. In this movie he wore a long overcoat which I take as another parallel.So there were respect and tradition, as well as new ideas. The story? Well, not so much a story as a coillection of little episodes.Superman worked as both a romantic hero, in the romance sense; and as a ""romantic"" hero, in the wouldn't-it-be-great-if... sense. And as to romance, give or take the actress playing Lois, who was adequate I guess--it was a very good job.For Superman.",5,Homage to the legend of Superman,1151712000,"07 1, 2006",2006,1906,"['Started', 'reading', 'Superman', '1940', 'so', 'had', 'low', 'expectations', 'was', 'wrong.Brendan', 'Routh', 'title', 'role', 'as', 'close', 'possible', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'maintain', 'continuity', 'not', 'introduce', 'delay', 'reconnecting', 'movie', 'Superman.Two', 'shots', 'one', 'scene', 'recreate', 'pay', 'homage', 'Joe', 'Shuster', 'illustration', 'most', 'famous', 'Superman', 'drawing', 'cover', 'Action', 'Comics', '1.On', 'radio', 'Superman', '1940-1950', 'Bud', 'Collyer', 'lacking', 'benefit', 'images', 'played', 'Clark', 'higher', 'voice', 'Superman', 'lower', 'job', 'FOR', 'SUPERMAN', 'So', 'did', 'movie', 'more', 'subtly.The', 'artists', 'movie', 'made', 'creative', 'decision', 'cape', 'was', 'less', 'red', 'overall', 'dark', 'red', 'outside', 'brighter', 'inside', 'presumably', 'would', 'not', 'dominate', 'action', 'visuals.Another', 'creative', 'decision', 'little', 'boy', 'won', 'give', 'away', 'point', 'way', 'new', 'directions', 'obvious', 'Part', 'New', 'Superman', 'Cinema', 'Serials.We', 'know', 'how', 'Kal-El', 'landed', 'Earth', 'movie', 'Clark', 'return', 'rebirth', 'paralleling', 'original', 'arrival', 'here.Superman', ""n't"", 'always', 'fly/float', 'movie', 'Sometimes', 'knee', 'bent', 'fly/leap', 'drawings', 'went', 'inception', 'eighties', 'homage.And', 'one', 'too', 'best', 'Luthor', 'stories', 'early', 'forties', 'when', 'was', 'evil', 'scientist', 'Luthor', 'wore', 'long', 'robe', 'drawn', 'brilliantly', 'John', 'SIkela', 'movie', 'wore', 'long', 'overcoat', 'take', 'parallel.So', 'were', 'respect', 'tradition', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'ideas', 'story', 'Well', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'coillection', 'little', 'episodes.Superman', 'worked', 'romantic', 'hero', 'romance', 'sense', 'romantic', 'hero', ""wouldn't-it-be-great-if"", 'sense', 'romance', 'give', 'take', 'actress', 'playing', 'Lois', 'who', 'was', 'adequate', 'guess', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'job.For', 'Superman']",N/A

Said to be a sequel to SUPERMAN & SUPERMAN II, it lacks the feel of the Donner film and not even the Donner/Lester amalgamation that is the 2nd film.  I like Brandon Routh as Kent/Superman.  He isn't Christopher Reeve but he does a pretty decent job.  Kevin Spacey is a truly vile and vicious Lex Luthor, Parker Posey a trip as his girlfriend Kitty.

As the acting goes, the weak link is Kate Bosworth.  She is such a lousy Lois Lane.

Cameos by Noel Neil and Jack Larson. About 30 minutes of really good film.The cons (Warning: spoilers ahead):It was about an hour too long. I can't begin to count the number of scenes during which I thought ""Oh please, get on with it"" because they were dragging on so long. Too many scenes with people just standing around as if they wanted to make sure you got a good look at them. It just dragged, unless you needed to visit the restroom frequently, in which case you didn't have to miss much. This movie would have been much better with some good editing to take it down to an hour and a half.The beginning seemed odd to me. Why all that footage of a young Clark? This was Superman Returns, not Superman Begins. None of that footage had any connection to the rest of the film.Whose bright idea was it to replace the red in Superman's costume with the color of dried blood? After almost 60 years they think they need to change the colors? And why no S on the cape?Kate Bosworth made a lousy Lois Lane. I can't say if it was Kate or if they just didn't give her much to work with. Teri Hatcher did a much better job in Lois and Clark. Maybe it was because I went to see a movie about Superman, not emotional angst between Lois and Superman. Lois has always been driven as a reporter, but hardly see that side of her at all in this movie. She's too consumed by taking care of her son, dealing with her honey, and her resentment for Superman because he left without saying goodbye. In short, she's not Lois Lane, she's just a single mom with relationship issues.Too little Superman. You'd think that in a 2 hour 34 minute film about the return of Superman you'd see more of him.How do they explain the fact that at one point Superman can barely stand up on the big rock thing, and then a few minutes later he can lift it out of Earth's orbit?I won't go on.

1023564,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B000J10EQU,Linda Linguvic,"[3, 7]","I am probably giving away my age but, as a child, I used to enjoy Superman on the radio.  I also read all of the comics.  By the time the television series began however, I considered Superman ""kid stuff"" and, for this reason, never saw any of the film versions of the Superman saga on the big screen either.  However, I'm now a grandma.  So watching ""Superman Returns"" with my 5- and 6-year old grandchildren was an interesting experience.When the film opens, Superman, played by newcomer Brandon Routh, is returning as Clark Kent to his mother, an elderly Eva Marie Saint.  He's been traveling in outer space for five years, trying to discover if the planet he originally came from, Krypton, still exists.  It doesn't.  And so he is thrust back into his life as both Superman and the quiet reporter, Clark Kent.  Naturally, he wants to see Lois Lane again, who just happens to have a 5-year old son and a boyfriend.  Of course there is also a bad guy.  That's Kevin Spacy, and he is introduced in a scene with an elderly woman which was extremely confusing.  This bad guy has a girlfriend, played by Parker Posey, who adds a bit of life into the rest of the film which seems a bit tired.Much to the delight of my grandchildren and the rest of the audience, there were great special effects.  However, I spent a lot of time explaining superman facts to them, like where Superman came from, and that the bad guy can hurt Superman by using Kryptonite. There is one part where the bad guy is beating up a weak superman which upset the children, but I was sure to tell them that in a movie like this Superman will ALWAYS win out in the end.  All of this explanation caused my grandson to as me, ""How do YOU know so much about Superman, Grandma?""Yes.  I did enjoy the film.  But I don't think it had anything to do with its quality.  ""Superman Returns"" would have bored me completely if I didn't have my fresh-faced grandchildren to play mentor to.

1023566,A2W7C0V4G36EB9,B000J10EQU,LK,"[0, 4]","I remember seeing Superman, The Movie several times in the movie theatre.  A wee bit too young to have a crush on the hero (I was 12), I enjoyed watching it for it's fabulous special effects (I believed a man could fly).I really enjoyed Superman II, this time with a bit more appreciation for the man in tights, being about 15.  My main crush in the world was Han Solo, but a super strong hero with such a gentle heart was a huge romantic draw.What I always loathed was the fact that Clark kissed Lois and made her forget their whole affair.  Even back in the day, even in my young and innocent state of mind and body, I was affronted by the idea of someone doing that to someone. It seemed a violation even then, and now, with all the date rape drugs out there - it seems even more of a violation to this 40 year old woman.I don't like my hero to have feet so heavily laden with clay that he can't take off.  Not Superman.I won't even discuss III and IV.  IV may have had some amount of redeeming qualities (sans the Nuk-u-lar man garbage) but from what I understand, the best parts of the movie were left on the cutting room floor.This new take on my old favorite intrigued me.  I enjoyed Brandon as Superman and was touched by how he uttered lines from the originals - 'Statistically speaking, it's still the safest way to travel' - even if it was banal and hokey.I enjoyed Bosworth as Lois, although she isn't Margot Kidder. Few people are.Spacey as Luthor and Posey as his henchwoman were brilliant.What wasn't brilliant was the implications behind the parentage of Lois's son.  If this truly takes off from Superman II, Lois should have no idea how she managed to end up pregnant with Superman's child - a concern I had back in 1981 - what if she ended up pregnant?I'm thinking most women would be horrified and angry at the idea of having no memory of being intimate with someone -even someone like him.  In fact, one might suspect that it was a Kryptonian thing - sleep with women and make them forget about it.  Yet no implication of menace-felt was made.  Lois was angry that he left, but that's about it.So I'm hoping that there is a slight retconning here of the story. Lois and Superman had a fling, but all he made her forget was the part where he's Clark Kent.Again, I'm just not sure.

1023568,A2LPIJ9DMMXFM4,B000J10EQU,Lou Pavone,"[3, 5]","When you are a big fan of the Superman character, you want `them' to get it right, especially knowing the new movie has been in infamous development hell for 19 years. You want to get excited while you're watching it and have your expectations met and be surprised by some new, interesting `2006' interpretation on it. You want to give it 5 stars.Whilst the film had some scenes were you felt you were getting a cinematic rush, aided by the repeat of the emotive, classic music score, I came out of the film with mixed feelings...just another Hollywood `3 star' blockbuster with a lot of attention to detail, a lot of money thrown at it for CGI effects but for all the time and money spent on development, the golden rule should still be that you're only as good as your script/storyline. The scriptwriters, Dan Harris (27) and Michael Dougherty (??) are very young and perhaps lack life experience when writing about matters of the heart. Perhaps Bryan Singer lacks Richard Donner's life experience when directing actors to emote. The script lacked smart, original, inspired dialogue and reeked of being worked over and over, conscious not to offend, conscious to get a PG rating (it got an `M' here anyway), conscious of marketing tie ins, conscious of it's global success potential (`truth, justice and all that stuff'). You could feel the interference from Warner Bros executives trying to justify their salaries as you were watching it. ""You can't have a boy or his mother (Lois) or her defacto screaming as they are potentially about to drown"". ""You can't have people on a plane about to go down, scream or look terrified. It might offend or scare children. ""Keep it PG."" When you find yourself mentally rewriting the dialogue from your cinema seat, wishing that the Aussie extras in the crowd scenes were not mute and yelled out more...""go Superman! We love you!"" then it becomes frustrating to watch. Not sure if the budget was too tight to get the extras to speak or emote or if there was an actors equity problem, but the strange silence in crowd scenes (& in the Daily Planet news room) zapped the energy from the film when it should have been more exciting. Especially a film that professes to be so character driven and emotive. For this reason, shooting in Australia (in spite of the dollar stretching the effects budget further), worked against it for the feel of the film...it needed a New York/Metropolis sensibility if it was truly trying to tie in and be a sequel to parts 1 and 2. It needed American extras. It needed to be made there.Brandon Routh's stoic, cinematic performance as Superman is the best thing about the movie. That he could say so little and hold so much emotion in his eyes, you actually care that he feels alone in the world. It was a performance like a throw back to the old era of charismatic actors. Facial expressions and the eyes speak louder than words (especially when the words the actors have to speak aren't that interesting). He's a worthy successor to Chris Reeve's portrayal.Except for Routh, the performances were generally flat and lacklustre - lacking enthusiasm and energy. Kate Bosworth, who admitted to consciously not studying Kidder and previous actresses who have played Lois Lane, gave such an un-Lois like performance. Gone was the feistiness and steely resolve. She said she studied Kate Hepburn instead but I couldn't see that either. She played it too nice and victimy. Lois is nobody's victim. Perhaps it is hard to get great performances with actors concerned with hitting their marks with blue screens in backgrounds and CGI to worry about, but the responsibility lies with Bryan Singer who should have extracted more animated and `alive' performances (from Spacey as well). Casting too young (obviously, knowing the actors will get older with sequels in mind), didn't help to believe the love story or triangle or that 5 years could have elapsed since his return - I didn't buy it that this version Lois & Superman had history or were still in love, I didn't buy Kitty's tears (Parker Posey) when Superman was being tortured by Luthor and his henchmen. I didn't care that Luthor's motivation was that he was angry having done another jail term and wanting more real estate (again) like in Parts 1 & 2. There are so many villains in Superman mythology to choose from, give Lex a rest, surely it's been done as has weakening Superman's strength with Kryptonite. This is where Batman (& now Spiderman) has always done it better: new film = new villain, keep it fresh and don't repeat yourself. If General Zod was to reappear in the next sequel, then we know there's a nervous`ideas' block with the creators to think of something fresh, nervous to do something untried and unfortunately revert to something already done because it has worked before (Part 2).These kinds of films with these kinds of budgets seem to be created and approved by committee and not a visionary creative with the license to create the film he/she wants. For this reason, these types of films are sometimes good but rarely great because they are devoid of taking risks. Everything is so researched to death, everything created with marketing in mind to make as much money as possible. I understand it's a business, but don't try to be a great film (the visual & mystical comparisons to Jesus Christ were a bit `try hard'). If the same team is entrusted again on the next sequel, lighten up on the next one, don't over labour it, have more fun with it and make the actors work for their money. The actors looked startled at times (especially the child playing Lois's son).The noticeably smaller `s' shield on the suit was just another distraction while trying to enjoy the movie - more Superboy-ish in proportion than Superman-ish (not helped that Routh is only 26). The shield could do with a tweak on the next instalment to scale it back up a notch.The film felt like it was afraid to take off for fear of all the boxes not being ticked to please everyone which is a shame because it couldn't have been so much more had all the actors (& extras) fired up.",3,Superman Returns: half a really good film,1153526400,"07 22, 2006",2006,6098,"['When', 'are', 'big',

1023569,A3F2JUHM6C9RZ9,B000J10EQU,"LP Quagmire ""The prison has not been built th...","[8, 16]","Last summer, director Christopher Nolan reinvigorated the BATMAN legend with a character-driven thrill-ride chock full of surprises and endless invention, but the same can't be said of Bryan Singer's SUPERMAN RETURNS, which feels like a retread for much of its lethargic and bloated running-time. I can't say this was a major disappointment since my expectations going in were modest at best, but this thing was sooo shockingly mundane; nothing in this movie stirs up much excitement or comes close to matching the awe and wonder Richard Donner's film fashioned so exhuberantly.With few exceptions, the casting is disastrous: Bosworth takes the plucky Lois Lane and imbues her with the sum energy derived from digesting a handful of sleeping pills; Spacey's Luthor, while more faithful to the source material than previous screen versions, isn't half as memorable as Gene Hackman's playful take on the character, and Frank Langella is sooo lackluster a Perry White I'm not even sure he was awake when his scenes were shot. As for Routh, he improved as the film progressed, but he still looks more like Superboy (or, more precisely, RUSHMORE's Max Fischer) than the Man of Steel. (His adolescent looks and awkward first attempts to mimic Christopher Reeve's Clark Kent are painful to watch)The missteps in casting could have been glossed over if the film delivered some truly jaw-dropping scenes of Super-derring-do, but there's little suspense or excitement to the action set-pieces that seem regurgitated from previous films, and the special-effects -- the one area it was reasonable to expect improvement in leaps and bounds -- are competent but unambitious and not that big an upgrade from what Donner achieved in 1978. In fact, director Bryan Singer, who did such a fine job with the first two X-MEN films, seems so intent on capturing the style of the Donner classic that he leaves little of his own imprint on SUPERMAN RETURNS.  SUPERMAN RETURNS most reminds me of Tim Burton's ""re-imagining"" of PLANET OF THE APES; each had heaps of money lavished on them, but both are completely lifeless. And since when did Clark Kent wear glasses as a young boy??Ultimately, this new SUPERMAN may appeal more to those who didn't grow up with the Christopher Reeve movies, but at 2 1/2 hours, it may be too slow to become the smash Warner was hoping for; it certainly won't rule the box-office for 13 consecutive weeks as the 1978 original did.  In the end, it's ironic the filmmakers chose to feature the song ""Heart and Soul"" when SUPERMAN RETURNS had neither.",2,SUPER MUNDANE!,1153872000,"07 26, 2006",2006,2555,"['Last', 'summer', 'director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'reinvigorated', 'BATMAN', 'legend', 'character-driven', 'thrill-ride', 'chock', 'full', 'surprises', 'endless', 'invention', 'same', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'SUPERMAN', 'RETURNS', 'retread', 'much', 'lethargic', 'bloated', 'running-time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'major', 'disappointment', 'expectations', 'going', 'were', 'modest', 'best', 'thing', 'was', 'sooo', 'shockingly', 'mundane', 'nothing', 'movie', 'up', 'much', 'excitement', 'close', 'matching', 'awe', 'wonder', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'film', 'fashioned', 'so', 'exhuberantly.With', 'few', 'exceptions', 'casting', 'disastrous', 'Bosworth', 'plucky', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'sum', 'energy', 'derived', 'digesting', 'handful', 'sleeping', 'pills', 'Spacey', 'Luthor', 'more', 'faithful', 'source', 'material', 'previous', 'screen', 'versions', ""n't"", 'half', 'as', 'memorable', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'playful', 'take', 'character', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'sooo', 'lackluster', 'Perry', 'White', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'was', 'awake', 'when', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'Routh', 'improved', 'film', 'progressed', 'still', 'more', 'Superboy', 'more', 'precisely', 'RUSHMORE', 'Max', 'Fischer', 'Man', 'Steel', 'adolescent', 'looks', 'awkward', 'first', 'mimic', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'are', 'painful', 'watch', 'missteps', 'casting', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'glossed', 'film', 'delivered', 'truly', 'jaw-dropping', 'scenes', 'Super-derring-do', 'little', 'suspense', 'excitement', 'action', 'set-pieces', 'seem', 'regurgitated', 'previous', 'films', 'special-effects', 'one', 'area', 'was', 'reasonable', 'expect', 'improvement', 'leaps', 'bounds', 'are', 'competent', 'unambitious', 'not', 'big', 'upgrade', 'what', 'Donner', 'achieved', '1978', 'fact', 'director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'who', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'first', 'two', 'X-MEN', 'films', 'so', 'intent', 'capturing', 'style', 'Donner', 'classic', 'little', 'own', 'imprint', 'SUPERMAN', 'RETURNS', 'SUPERMAN', 'RETURNS', 'most', 'reminds', 'Tim', 'Burton', 're-imagining', 'PLANET', 'THE', 'APES', 'had', 'heaps', 'money', 'lavished', 'are', 'completely', 'lifeless', 'when', 'did', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'wear', 'glasses', 'young', 'boy', 'Ultimately', 'new', 'SUPERMAN', 'may', 'appeal', 'more', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'grow', 'up', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'movies', '2', '1/2', 'hours', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'slow', 'become', 'smash', 'Warner', 'was', 'hoping', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'rule', 'box-office', '13', 'consecutive', 'weeks', '1978', 'original', 'did', 'end', 'ironic', 'filmmakers', 'chose', 'feature', 'song', 'Heart', 'Soul', 'when', 'SUPERMAN', 'RETURNS', 'had']",N/A

Some of the relationship dynamics falls flat (there was no chemistry between Superman and Lois, for one thing). Routh does look a bit like Reeve, and both he and Spacey are excellent in the lead roles, and the supporting cast is good, too, with Parker Posey getting many of the funniest lines.

But I really wanted to like this movie. The trailers were intriguing. Stopping a bullet with your eye? How cool is that?  It suggested a spark of originality, of pushing the envelope. But when the movie starts sluggishly and gives us our first glimpse of the young Superman running and leaping a la the first Spiderman movie--so patent was the rip-off, it made me shake my head in disbelief--it becomes apparent that there's little hope.Brandon Routh brings a naive charm to the role of Superman. No great shakes, but he's the best of the bunch. Kevin Spacey? Wasted -- plus he doesn't bring the sick fun to the role that I expected. Granted, with those ridiculous lines, he started at a great disadvantage. Kate Bosworth is pretty enough, but most of her tears -- and there are too many -- seem eyedropped in.  James Marsden? Eh. Parker Posey? A low-rent Valerie Perrine. The kid? He looks like a young, anemic McCauley Culkin, and that about sums up his performance.And as this Mulligan Stew of a movie plods on and on, this way and that, we do get some impressive special effects. The flying is very realistic and thrilling. But for every impressive effect, there are bad ones, too.  In a number of scenes, Superman looks fake -- the helicopters look fake -- the buildings look fake. If this is what you get for effects in a $225 million film, someone ought to sue the special effects company for overbilling.It's worth mentioning, too, the overbearing analogies to the story of Jesus. Yeah, yeah. We know Jor-El sent his only begotten son, blah, blah, blah, but the scene in the hospital, when we see the bed empty ... too much.Watch box office plummet as word of this weary -- and stupefying  -- movie spreads.The trailer for Spider-man 3 was the best part of this film.

Still, I know who all the characters are and was quite anxious to see this movie.  While that means I missed out of some cool cameos, I still enjoyed it.For five years, the world has been without Superman (Brandon Routh).  Now, he's come back to Earth and is ready to pick up where he left off.Fortunately, his alter ego, Clark Kent, is able to get his old job back at The Daily Planet.  While Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) is thrilled to see him back, his reunion with Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) is very chilly.  During the last five years, she's moved on with her life.  She has a son (Tristan Lake Leabu) and is engaged to Richard White (James Marsden).  Seeing Superman again stirs up old feelings within her, so she's not exactly thrilled to be assigned to cover him again.Meanwhile, old nemesis Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) has just been released from prison.  He's already planning his next bid for world domination.  It involves crystals, kryptonite, and creating land.  Will Superman figure out what he's up to in time to stop him?The movie is two and a half hours long, and unfortunately it feels it.  The first part of the movie is very slow with back story even this newbie didn't need.  Once the story got going, it was interesting and held my interest through the end, which again dragged on for a scene or two more then necessary.Much has been made of casting an unknown in the roll.  I liked Brandon Routh in the lead.  He has a commanding presence as Superman.  Kevin Spacey was great as well.  His Luthor was equal parts fun and menace.  The only real problem was Kate Bosworth.  She did a great job, but she looked too young for the part.  For this story to work, the actress playing Lois needed to be at least thirty, and Kate isn't.And, of course, there are the special effects, which are incredible and flawlessly fit into the film.Overall, this is a good movie, but not the great movie I had hoped it would be.",4,Superman Needed a Little Less to His Return,1165190400,"12 4, 2006",2006,2049,"['must', 'admit', 'only', 'have', 'working', 'knowledge', 'Superman', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'previous', 'movies', 'various', 'TV', 'shows', 'Still', 'know', 'who', 'characters', 'are', 'was', 'quite', 'anxious', 'see', 'movie', 'missed', 'cool', 'cameos', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'it.For', 'five', 'years', 'world', 'been', 'Superman', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'Now', 'come', 'back', 'Earth', 'ready', 'pick', 'up', 'where', 'left', 'off.Fortunately', 'alter', 'ego', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'able', 'get', 'old', 'job', 'back', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'Sam', 'Huntington', 'thrilled', 'see', 'back', 'reunion', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'very', 'chilly', 'last', 'five', 'years', 'moved', 'life', 'son', 'Tristan', 'Lake', 'Leabu', 'engaged', 'Richard', 'White', 'James', 'Marsden', 'Seeing', 'Superman', 'again', 'up', 'old', 'feelings', 'not', 'exactly', 'thrilled', 'be', 'assigned', 'cover', 'again.Meanwhile', 'old', 'nemesis', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'prison', 'already', 'planning', 'next', 'bid', 'world', 'domination', 'crystals', 'kryptonite', 'creating', 'land', 'Will', 'Superman', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'up', 'time', 'stop', 'movie', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'long', 'unfortunately', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'very', 'slow', 'back', 'story', 'even', 'newbie', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'Once', 'story', 'got', 'going', 'was', 'interesting', 'held', 'interest', 'end', 'again', 'dragged', 'scene', 'two', 'more', 'then', 'necessary.Much', 'been', 'made', 'casting', 'unknown', 'roll', 'liked', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'lead', 'commanding', 'presence', 'Superman', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'was', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'Luthor', 'was', 'equal', 'parts', 'fun', 'menace', 'only', 'real', 'problem', 'was', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'looked', 'too', 'young', 'part', 'story', 'work', 'actress', 'playing', 'Lois', 'needed', 'be', 'least', 'thirty', 'Kate', ""isn't.And"", 'course', 'are', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'incredible', 'flawlessly', 'fit', 'film.Overall', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'had', 'hoped', 'would', 'be']",N/A

1023583,ARIO0LYVA1J8,B000J10EQU,Mark L.,"[7, 14]","Bryan Singer was supposed to be such a great fan of Superman that he gave up being the kingpin of the X-Men series for the chance to direct a  Superman movie.  Maybe his abilities didn't match his enthusiasm.It's true that Christopher Reeve can never be replaced.  But was Brandon Routh really the best actor Singer could find for the title character?  Routh is a decent enough actor, I suppose, and he handled the physical stunt part of the role pretty well.  But I never felt he was SUPERMAN.  Christopher Reeve had the look, the intensity, the attitude, the PRESENCE, and the CHARISMA to burst off the screen and make you BELIEVE in Superman.  Routh's face rarely changes expression.  He's so quiet, gloomy, and flat that he makes Superman seem like a secondary character in his own movie.Singer didn't serve Routh very well with that re-designed costume.  I don't mind the muted colors; they make the suit seem a little less comic-booky.  But those low-rise tiny red ""briefs"" and the high, tight collar make the proportions of the costume look weird and unbalanced.A few random thoughts, and sorry if I repeat anything in the 430+ reviews that came before this one, since I could only read the last few.  In the farm flashback, why is the young Clark Kent wearing glasses?  The first movie showed that he was super the first moment he reached earth.  How did Supie stretch out the trip to Krypton to **5 YEARS**???  (Of course, it had to be 5 years for the kid to be the right age when he got back.)  What did he expect to find?  It's a given in Superman lore that Krypton exploded into pieces.  What was there? Where did he find the Kryptonian ship he returned to earth in--and why did he need it?  If he had found the remains of Krypton, wouldn't it all be Kryptonite now, and do him in?  And HOW could Superman abandon earth and his ""never-ending battle"" without a word to anyone except his mother to go off on some ridiculous personal quest for 5 years?The explanation that Luthor got out of prison because Superman didn't show up to be a witness when his case was appealed is silly.  Appellate courts only review the records of lower courts for legal errors; they don't hear witnesses or take testimony.The flying and rescue effects are great, as you expect in 2006.  But guess what--after almost 30 years, the special effects in Superman 1 hold up surprisingly well.Finally, Singer said that he intended this movie to be a sequel to Superman 2.  But the presence of the kid (a monumental change in the Superman world) makes that hard to see.  In the original release of Superman 2 (the Lester version), Superman gave up his powers before he and Lois made love.  So why is the boy showing signs of becoming super?  And then later in the Lester version, Clark/Superman gave Lois the ""amnesia kiss,"" so she'd forget about their brief affair.  I'll bet she was surprised when she discovered she was pregnant!  She must have spent a lot of time wondering how it happened!  So in ""Superman Returns,"" how does she know Supie is the father??  And if she knows THAT, why doesn't she also remember the other thing she learned in Superman 2--that Superman is Clark Kent?  Pretty selective, Singer!On the other hand, if you consider the just-released Richard Donner Director's cut of Superman 2 (which, to be fair, we can't expect Singer to have conformed to), Superman turned back time, as he did in Superman 1, so that the whole movie never happened.  That means Supie and Lois never made love.  So where did the kid come from?These problems make ""Superman Returns"" a poor sequel to Superman 2, and a much weaker film than it could have been.

First, one realizes that one would like to pay a little homage to the Chris Reeve Superman. But when one lifts entire pages of dialogue from the 1978 film, it comes closer to plagerism.Kevin Spacey does not play a convincing super villan. He terribly underplays Lex Luthor until the moment that Superman is in his power, and then he lets his inner rage loose to great effect. The evil plot seemed derivitive and trite to this reviewer.Finally, would it have hurt to have said, ""Truth, justice, and the American Way?"" Superman is an iconic American hero, an immigrant glad of the refuge America has given him and wanting veru much to give back.

Things that don't make any sense, but the writers and directors were too dumb or lazy to know it: Young Clark wearing glasses (which were a disguise for Superman, who didn't exist yet); the weightless scene when the plane goes into a dive also inexplicably causing silence in the cabin; the electro-magnetic pulse turning off all power in the area except for the baseball stadium; pilots continuing to try to fly the plane as it nosed straight down with NO WINGS; etc.3.

After going on an exploratory mission of his home planet Krypton after hearing it still existed Superman, (Brandon Routh)after discovering Krypton is an icy graveyard, returns to Earth to continue on with his life as Superman as well as his alter ego Clark Kent.  The trouble is, he's been gone for 5 years and the world has moved on without him.  Specifically, Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), who is now engaged to Richard White (James Marsden) and now has a son.  To make things worse, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) has devised a devious plan to basically have the world at his feet by creating a new island from Kryptonite crystals.  Will Superman save the day and recapture Lois's heart?  Those are pretty much the two main questions in this outstanding motion picture from director Bryan Singer (X-Men, X-Men 2, The Usual Suspects).  Singer definitely taps into several aspects from the original Superman film from 1978 in this film but make no mistake, this movie stands on its own two feet and is without question its own movie.  Great writing, great script, great special effects, and great acting make this the majestic, incredible epic film that it is.  From the start of this movie, it grabs you and doesn't let go.  From the incredible airplane sequence at the beginning of the film to its final moving moments, this movie makes all the right moves.  Right from the getgo, it looks and feels like an instant classic and it follows through for the entire film.  Brandon Routh makes the role of Superman/Clark Kent his own with a brilliant performance that comes excruciatingly close to that of Christopher Reeve.  Kate Bosworth holds her own in most scenes as Lois Lane but if there was one weak link in this movie, it is her.  She just does not have it the way Margot Kidder did.  Kevin Spacey completely immerses himself in the role of the angry, bitter Lex Luthor, and some nice work from Parker Posey as well as Kitty Kowalski, Lex's female acquaintance.  Frank Langella is good enough as Perry White, and James Marsden is interesting as Richard White, Perry's nephew.  For their supporting roles, Sam Huntington is fine as Jimmy Olsen and Eva Marie Saint is a convincing Martha Kent.  Kudos to director Bryan Singer as well for the archive footage of Marlon Brando as Jor-El, and the unique way he incorporated that into the movie.  Superman Returns takes itself very seriously and is meant to be taken as such.  It is not a campy, silly movie that I think some people were expecting.  It is an epic in every sense of the word and is the better for it.  Without question one of the best superhero movies ever made, it is better than both Spiderman movies and bests most of the Batman films.  Though the story is obviously unrealistic the whole point of a movie of this nature is to provide complete escapism entertainment, which it does remarkably.  The movie is put together in such a way that it gives the viewer every reason to think that there will be a sequel and hopefully there will be one and hopefully Bryan Singer will be back to direct it.  Superman Returns has a runtime of 2 hours, 30 minutes and it is worth every second of it.  A hell of a movie no matter how you slice it.  After viewing this film for myself though, I can't help but wonder about some of the negative reviews of this film to include the Amazon reader reviews.  I don't see how a person could find nothing to like about Superman Returns.  It is unfortunate that some people's tastes are so shallow that unless something is being blown up every five minutes or if there isn't blood on the screen in every scene or an ""action"" scene every minute that it is a bad or ""boring"" movie.  This is an intelligent, smart movie made for smart people with depth and taste.  How refreshing it is to see a movie with a plot and an actual story instead of throwing a bunch of cheesy special effects in and hoping for the best.  One of the best movies of the year, Superman Returns is a memorable classic.",5,UP UP AND AWAY,1153440000,"07 21, 2006",2006,4038,"['been', '19', 'years', 'Man', 'Steel', 'finally', 'back', 'going', 'exploratory', 'mission', 'home', 'planet', 'Krypton', 'hearing', 'still', 'existed', 'Superman', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'discovering', 'Krypton', 'icy', 'graveyard', 'returns', 'Earth', 'continue', 'life', 'as', 'Superman', 'as', 'well', 'alter', 'ego', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'trouble', 'been', 'gone', '5', 'years', 'world', 'moved', 'Specifically', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'who', 'now', 'engaged', 'Richard', 'White', 'James', 'Marsden', 'now', 'son', 'make', 'things', 'worse', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'devised', 'devious', 'plan', 'basically', 'have', 'world', 'feet', 'creating', 'new', 'island', 'Kryptonite', 'crystals', 'Will', 'Superman', 'save', 'day', 'recapture', 'Lois', 'heart', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'two', 'main', 'questions', 'outstanding', 'motion', 'picture', 'director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'X-Men', 'X-Men', '2', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'Singer', 'definitely', 'several', 'aspects', 'original', 'Superman', 'film', '1978', 'film', 'make', 'mistake', 'movie', 'own', 'two', 'feet', 'question', 'own', 'movie', 'Great', 'writing', 'great', 'script', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'great', 'acting', 'make', 'majestic', 'incredible', 'epic', 'film', 'start', 'movie', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'incredible', 'airplane', 'sequence', 'beginning', 'film', 'final', 'moving', 'moments', 'movie', 'right', 'moves', 'Right', 'getgo', 'feels', 'instant', 'classic', 'entire', 'film', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'role', 'Superman/Clark', 'Kent', 'own', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'excruciatingly', 'close', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'own', 'most', 'scenes', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'was', 'one', 'weak', 'link', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'have', 'way', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'did', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'completely', 'role', 'angry', 'bitter', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'nice', 'work', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'as', 'well', 'Kitty', 'Kowalski', 'Lex', 'female', 'acquaintance', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'good', 'enough', 'Perry', 'White', 'James', 'Marsden', 'interesting', 'Richard', 'White', 'Perry', 'nephew', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Sam', 'Huntington', 'fine', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'convincing', 'Martha', 'Kent', 'Kudos', 'director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'as', 'well', 'archive', 'footage', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Jor-El', 'unique', 'way', 'incorporated', 'movie', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'very', 'seriously', 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'such', 'not', 'campy', 'silly', 'movie', 'think', 'people', 'were', 'expecting', 'epic', 'sense', 'word', 'better', 'question', 'one', 'best', 'superhero', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'better', 'Spiderman', 'movies', 'most', 'Batman', 'films', 'story', 'obviously', 'unrealistic', 'whole', 'point', 'movie', 'nature', 'provide', 'complete', 'escapism', 'entertainment', 'remarkably', 'movie', 'put', 'together', 'such', 'way', 'viewer', 'reason', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'sequel', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'hopefully', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'will', 'be', 'back', 'direct', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'runtime', '2', 'hours', '30', 'minutes', 'worth', 'second', 'hell', 'movie', 'matter', 'how', 'slice', 'viewing', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'negative', 'reviews', 'film', 'include', 'Amazon', 'reader', 'reviews', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'person', 'could', 'find', 'nothing', 'like', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'unfortunate', 'people', 'tastes', 'are', 'so', 'shallow', 'something', 'being', 'blown', 'up', 'five', 'minutes', ""n't"", 'blood', 'screen', 'scene', 'action', 'scene', 'minute', 'bad', 'boring', 'movie', 'intelligent', 'smart', 'movie', 'made', 'smart', 'people', 'depth', 'taste', 'How', 'refreshing', 'see', 'movie', 'plot', 'actual', 'story', 'instead', 'throwing', 'bunch', 'cheesy', 'special', 'effects', 'hoping', 'best', 'One', 'best', 'movies', 'year', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'memorable', 'classic']",N/A
1023590,A13TO1ZFAH9SVN,B000J10EQU,Matthew Edmundson,"[2, 3]","There hasn't been a great Superman movie made in my 22 years of living. I'm a huge fan of the man of steel though and this was one of my most antcipated movies of 06. It's Directed by Bryan Singer(X-Men, X-2} who left that franchise to come Superman. All Superman movies are graded upon the first made by Richard Donner and the numerous great tv shows based on the character. Superman Returns jumpstarts the movie franchise and gives us something Superman 3 and 4 lacked being a good movie.Superman(Brandon Routh) has returned to earth from his five year exodus to the planet Krypton. He found the planet in ruins and returns to earth almost in a mid-life crisis. Earth has gone on without him. Lois Lane(Bosworth) has moved on being engaged and having a five year old son. Lex Luthor(Spacey)has gotten out of jail because Superman missed his courtdate. Once again he is launching a sinister plot to make himself alot of money and kill some people in the process. Superman must rebound and stop Lex and get life back to normal.I liked Brandon Routh as Superman. I hate the little curl they had him wearing when he was the man of steel and not Clark Kent. He is a Christopher Reeve clone and that has to be how he got the nod over Tom Welling from Smallville. He fits the part great though. He's a physical presence on the screen and like Reeve he just embodies Superman. You look at him and say, ""Yeah, this is Superman."" It's a huge role for a non-known actor to take on.Kevin Spacey is on the greatest actors of my generation and plays ""The Worlds Greatest Criminal Mind"" to perfection. Where Hackman was over the top Spacey is funny. He is intense at times and just a touch sarcastic. I wish he had more screen time, but oh well.Kate Bosworth is ok as Lois. She stops the movie from being five stars. It's not that she does a bad job, it's the things she can't do. Kate is 23 years old and Lois has to be in her early 30's. She is one of the most established reporters in the world and this movie has a five year old son. She looks to fresh out of college. She has good chemistry with Routh and could have played a younger Lois fine, but just doesn't fit the movie.The special effects are fantastic. The flying looks very real and is so smooth. It doesn't look computerized like lets say Neo in the Matrix series. He has all his abilities in the movie and uses them and they look the best they ever have.The specials on the two disc are alright.

1023591,A2MHDZXWWF0VIN,B000J10EQU,Matthew Kresal,"[2, 2]","After missing from film screens for nearly twenty years and nearly twenty eight years since the first Christopher Reeve film, the question everyone was undoubtedly was if the franchise could be resurrected and as this film proves the answer is a most definite ""yes"" with this film which may actually be better then the 1978 film that started it all.A film is about as good as its leading actor and without the right actor playing Superman the film could easily have failed. But with newcomer Brandon Routh in the role many fears were laid to rest. Routh, like Reeve before him, slips into the role so well that within moments of his appearance as the Man of Steel he BECOMES Superman. Physically he is a perfect fit for Superman with his black hair, blue eyes, height, build and everything in between. But it just isn't the physical nature that Routh fits into the role, it's also in his acting ability. Drawing inspiration from Reeve's performances in Superman and Superman II in order to perfectly fit into the roles of both Superman and Clark Kent, Routh is successful in marinating the strong masculine side of Superman and the clumsy, almost geeky, nature of Clark Kent. In short, Routh is Superman.The rest of the cast draws no complaints either. Kate Bosworth, despite being only 23, fits into the role of Lois Lane just as well as Routh as Superman. While she does lack some of the spunk of Margot Kidder's Lois Lane, she does play the sensitive side of Lois very well and her scenes with Superman are a highlight of the film as are her humorous exchanges with Perry White. Frank Langella slips well into the role of Perry White with comfortable ease as he is a foil for Lois and personifies the public's excitement about Superman's return. James Marsden does well in the role of Richard Perry, though his character does at time become a little annoying. Sam Huntington brings a lot of comic relief to the movie in the role of Jimmy Olson. Eva Marie Saint makes a welcomed appearance as Martha Kent and does very well in her few scenes in the film.And there is of course Kevin Spacey. If there was anyone out there who could possibly pull off the role of Lex Luthor besides Gene Hackman, it would be Spacey. And Spacey does it well. Spacey makes the role his own in more ways then one, brining a more humorous touch to the role. But while he brings more humor to Luthor, he also brings menace. When he has to be, Spacey can be more menacing then Hackman's Luthor ever was as demonstrated on the Krypton Island during one of the film's most shocking scenes. If there's a sequel (which is almost assured) I hope that Spacey, along with the rest of the cast, returns because you can't imagine a Superman movie without them now.Behind the camera, there is also a lot of talent at work also. Bryan Singer takes the realism and emotion from his X-Men movies and brings it to the film with great results. With a script by the two X-Men writers that they cooked up with Singer, the film's storyline is for the most part inspired. The idea of using Superman's disappearance as a catalyst for a story is inspired to say the least and the films' action sequences share the originality that the first two Christopher Reeve's film had in them. But it's the films plot that brings about the film's only major flaw. Luthor's plot seems to be a bit outlandish (even more so then say sinking California into the ocean) and the various schemes that he goes trough to get to that point serve to slow down the pace of the film considerably and create the only boring parts of the film.But what sets this film apart from other comic book movies / sequels is that there is an obvious love for the Christopher Reeve films present throughout the movie. From the film's opening credits, done in the style of the first movies legendary credits, to Marlon Brando's narration and brief appearance during the film, it is obvious that the film is both a sequel and homage.This is evident in two areas specifically: the production design and the music. John Barry's designs for the Fortress of Solitude in particular shines right trough onto the screen in all of its original glory along side with new designs for the Daily Planet and in many respects Metropolis itself, representing the infusing of the new with the old to create something better.But it is in the music that the greatest homage can be found. The opening frame of the film treats us to a new version of one of the greatest film scores of all time: John Williams score to Superman The Movie. The film opens with the Krypton theme and then goes into a full out rendition of the classic theme and it does so to the point that one is left in awe at the end of the opening credits as the theme not heard in full force since 1978 marks the return just as much as anything else in the film. The classic love theme also makes itself heard in the film and it adds to the majesty and wonder of the film. But composer John Ottman also brings out new material to accompany the classic Williams pieces and the music stands up next to the Williams score and holds it own.For the sum of its parts, Superman Returns is the resurrection of one of the greatest characters of all time. Not only does it resurrect him, it also brings the character soaring back to new heights in surpassing the films that made this film pays homage to so much.. Superman Returns indeed and we can only hope he's here to stay.",4,The Title Says It All,1225238400,"10 29, 2008",2008,5432,"['missing', 'film', 'screens', 'nearly', 'twenty', 'years', 'nearly',

The first films had actors cast by how they portrayed the characters and interacted with each other, not whether thier name looked good on the Marquee. The exception being Brando, cast then and returning here from the dead, to put a famous name on the poster.The failing of this film lies greatly in Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) who desperately needs to be the sharp, quick, sarcastic, and always seeing around Clarks corners. This Lois is bland, boring, and just not alive on the screen. She doesn't spar with Clark, she doesn't swoon for Superman. She's not strong or quirky, she's just plain, boring, there because she has to be, Lois. Compared to Margot Kidder or Teri Hatcher, she's just the quiet girl in the corner.

1023602,AWOSS0OBKHTJC,B000J10EQU,"Michael F. Hopkins ""A Deeper Groove""","[8, 11]","(from a more extensive feature, copyright 2006 Michael F. Hopkins)Filmmaker Bryan Singer continues to deliver the cinematicgoods with his exceptional work on SUPERMAN RETURNS. Theman who broke stunning dramatic ground with THE USUALSUSPECTS, and resurrected Marvel's overrated X-MENfranchise with two sharp motion pictures which shedthe comic series' overripe melodrama, brings us theheroic saga that audiences worldwide have been waitingfor since Richard Donner's 1st SUPERMAN film.More than a follow-up to that 1978 extravaganza, SUPERMANRETURNS is an epic feature which showcases the quality oftheme and character which Donner and the much-beloved actorChristopher Reeve were denied in their tireless efforts toportray the Man of Tomorrow as a straightforward saga.Where the 1978 feature (and Reeve's live-action series, inturn) was stymied by narrow-minded producers, the ham-handedbuffoonery of misapplied Broadway musical writers, along withthe genre snobbery and bastardized Gilbert & Sullivan stereotypesencouraged by Lorenzo Semple's condescending BATMAN debacle ofthe mid-1960s, Singer's 2006 feature strides the crest of alegion of films depicting a more authentic approach to theSequential genre.Singer's work on the X-MEN films, in fact, helped pioneer anapproach to such movies which emphasize the folkloric, theliterate, and compassionate in tales of heroism and wrongdoing;shunning the aimless loopiness and pathetic campiness of an AdamWest...  or latter-day mindless throwbacks such as LOIS & CLARK.Singer takes a daring chance, however, in that he presentsSUPERMAN RETURNS as a follow-up  -and partial homage- tothe Donner picture. That's especially risky if nemesis LexLuthor is to be played as a cheap carny barker the way hewas portrayed by the woefully misused acting legend GeneHackman in the 1978 feature. Fortunately, Kevin Spaceydeftly dances out of that trap; the master actor tippinghis hat to Hackman's audacity, while bringing home the icymenace of an uncaring manipulator who thinks nothing aboutmass murder, or bringing down a champion of good frombehind.Little about this Luthor to laugh about.In Brandon Routh, Singer makes quite a find. Many fanaticaltypes have decried the lead actor's lack of body mass, orhis visual and vocal similarity to Reeve. The key to portrayingSUPERMAN well, however, in in the balancing of subtlety tobring home the derring-do, whoever plays the part. A quickperusal of the animated SUPERMAN  of the 1990s will show adeeper, more consistently effective drama than most otheronscreen depictions of the saga combined for this veryreason. Likewise for the conviction of the series SMALLVILLE,or the integrity of the portrayal by George Reeves. Powersmay emphasize the scope of the tale. Characterization andinterplay form the tale.Where Donner and Reeve take charge in the 1978 film, that'swhat compels us to watch that film  -flaws and all- over andover again.For Singer, Routh delivers a SUPERMAN of great conviction, conflictedpassions and, in the end, the most heroic sense of responsibilitythat this age could portray. His every move, from striding througha hail of bullets to humbly coming clean on abandoning Earth for 5years, is the motion of a towering figure and a simple soul rolledup in one dynamic person. With just the one film, his adeptemulations of the wide-eyed Reeve portrayal have already blossomedinto a depiction of tortured innocence and deepening concern whichis all his own.That he could easily overpower an equally conflicted Lois Lane(played beautifully by Kate Bosworth), but chooses not to, is asuperb depiction of the Siegel & Schuster creation's most shiningattributes. This is no heartless ubermensch who takes what hewants. This is a being of respect and resolve.In consequence  and conscience, to the best of his ability inthe finest sense of the word, this is a man.There's much to admire about SUPERMAN RETURNS; among themthe sharp character play offered by Frank Langella's Perry White, thewry pivotal performance of James Marsden (Cyclops from the X-MENfilms), and touching scenes featuring SUPERMAN veterans Noel Neilland Jack Larson. Composer John Ottman treats the acclaimed JohnWilliams theme from 1978 with true respect and expertise, whilebringing in some musical higlights of his own which accentuatethe film's drama and pathos.Eva Marie Saint is marvelous as Martha Kent, a point furtheraccented by deleted scenes  -one in the documentary-  whichunderscore the film's drama with a keen, understanding wit. Watch,too, Parker Posey's cunning portrayal as Luthor's flip-talkingmoll. Not quite a departure from Valerie Perrine's dopeybombshell of the 1978 film, Posey's sidekick has a bit moredimension as a character, and plays the dopiness with a curtpurpose.Warner Home Video's 2-DVD set features a sweeping documentaryon the film's creation, and deleted scenes which show the hardchoices made by the film's editors. The deleted scenes alsofeature some wise editing choices in the removal of sceneswhich ape the 1978 film's corniest moments a bit too well...particularly where Luthor's villainy is concerned.The challenge for Singer, Routh, and company, is where thenext film(s) must go. Having paid homage to Richard Donnerand Christopher Reeve, one hopes that subsequent SUPERMANfilms will elaborate on the themes of the comic saga'smost effective writers, from Roger Stern and LouiseSimonson to Mark Waid and Jeph Loeb. After all, animatorsPaul Dini and Bruce Timm pivoted off these sources andmore, creating a provocative SUPERMAN storyline which helpedpave the way for the SMALLVILLE series and, to an extent,this very movie.SUPERMAN RETURNS is a fine motion picture, and a granddepiction of a great American folk hero. Let's hopethat studio bureaucracy doesn't curtail further activityin this area, as it has before.Time to fly.",5,A Superman For The Ages.,1164758400,"11 29, 2006",2006,5840,"['more', 'extensive',

1023604,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B000J10EQU,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[15, 19]","In an era of Batman Begins, Sin City, Spiderman, and 300, it's easy to forget that there was a time when a movie based on a comic book wasn't a sure thing.  For an example of a spectacular misfire, Spawn comes to mind; the movie was so obsessed with making the film look like a comic book that it actually FELT like you were watching a comic book, complete with isolated panels, minimal movement, and jarring transitions between scenes.  One moment Spawn's threatening some guy and the next he's standing on some building with his really fabulous cloak whipping in the wind.Similarly, Superman is a visually beautiful movie that has nowhere to go.  The iconic scenes of Superman basking in the sun's rays, or hovering about the Earth listening for crime, or when he's actually doing something heroic (which happens far too infrequently) fail to cover up the complete lack of a coherent plot.  For example:Superman's been gone for years...one assumes that whatever he discovered on his long journey would have something to do with the plot.  Nope.Lex Luthor has discovered Superman's Fortress of Solitude and plans to create an entire continent out of a hybridized Kryptonite.  Surely that means Superman won't even be able to get NEAR the place, right?  Nope.Once said ""continent"" shows up, it's clear that the whole thing is patently uninhabitable.  This is Lex's big plan, to create a rock formation and play cards while he waits for...people to call him and offer him money or something?  Surely he must have more up his sleeve? Nope.Heck, the world's changed a lot since Superman's been gone, right?  Wouldn't it make sense to really pound home how different Earth is, with it's global warming, crazy politics, and pop starlets?  Nope.  Instead, the crazy new world is supposed to be summed up with a kid taking a picture of Superman with his cell phone--that's right, the kid scooped the Daily Planet with just his camera phone! ISN'T THAT WACKY?Superman Returns is very much a movie in love with the original and, while visually faithful, it's a very poor imitation.  Yes, Brandon Routh looks like a spitting image of Christopher Reeves, but he has no real acting chops to display since he barely speaks.  Kate Bosworth is far too young and whiny as Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) still wears a bowtie for some reason, and the rest of the cast is too caught up in being iconic comic book characters to be memorable.  Even the amazing Kevin Spacey can only be a marginally cartoonish Lex Luthor, jarringly transforming into a murderous thug at the movie's climax.The pacing is all wrong.  Superman saving Lois from a plane crash is great.  Superman fighting criminals with belt-fed chain guns is excellent.  Superman drowning, Superman moping, Superman frustrated over Lois Lane, Superman convalescing in a friggin' hospital?  NOT GREAT.Superman Returns has its moments, and if you squint your eyes it almost feels like the magic from the first movie has been captured.  But then it's gone and the movie drags, and drags, and drags.

Okay, Superman leaves Earth for 5 years searching for Krypton...hold on...why would he be searching for Krypton in the first place?  He KNOWS it was destroyed thus this aspect of the plot makes zero sense.  Next, Lois Lane has a child that is seemingly his yet she doesn't seem to know that Superman is Clark Kent. This totally destroys Superman's character as the all american boy scout and once again leaves me scratching my head wondering why. Next, Lex has a plot to make himself rich that sounds suprizingly like what happened in the first Superman movie when Luthor caused half of California to drop into the ocean.Now, on to the cast.  Who are these people? They cast not one role correctly in this entire movie.  I'm sure Tom Welling and the rest of the Smallville cast had contractual obligations that prevented them from starring in this movie but that doesn't excuse the poor choices made for all these iconic characters.  Where is Christopher Reeve, may he rest in peace, when you need him? Or Tom Welling for that matter.

Lois has a son and a significant other, the people of Metropolis have largely forgotten him, and Lex Luthor has been released from prison because Superman couldn't appear at his appeal hearing.Alrighty then!  Let's just add legal/judicial cluelessness to the scientific cluelessness that so often drives a movie.  I can forgive either one, IF the plot keeps me from noticing the anamolies.  But in this case, it's just too much of a rehash of old story elements.  Now Lex is parlaying an ill-gotten inheritance into his quest for total domination of the world.Brandon Routh does a fine job of mimicking Christopher Reeve in the role, but let's face it, Reeve's Superman should really be a footnote (albeit a very bankable one) in his otherwise stellar career.  Kate Bostwick looks appropriately conflicted as Lois, pining for her superhero boyfriend of old and tending to her son and boyfriend (James Marsden).The only reasons worth watching are the villains, in the person of Lex Luthor (played by Kevin Spacey) and his moll played by Parker Posey.  Spacey actually makes a much better Luthor than did Gene Hackman back in the original series.  Note to Ms. Posey, if you really prefer evil geniuses... well...

1023607,ATNX84AGYIN39,B000J10EQU,"Michael Roffman ""pinball wizard""","[77, 95]","After nearly twenty years, Superman returns triumphantly to the screen to save the day of both the moviegoer and the theater owners looking for golden entertainment. It might not hurt the studio producers too, but let's keep them out of this. Supes is back and there is popcorn to be made.Director Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects, X-Men) takes a dusty, beat up franchise and literally sinks his teeth into it. This has class written all over it and much like the director's previous work, this is really no surprise. It's a blessing in disguise.After last year's schizophrenic Batman Begins and this year's laughable at most X-Men 3: The Last Stand, Superman Returns fails to follow suit. This is a film that takes all that was great in comic book filmmaking and just stains the screen with it. This is a film that knows what it wants to do and simply does it.More than anything, this is a film.Brandon Routh deliciously portrays Clark Kent/Superman as he awkwardly returns to his second home, planet Earth. There he finds that the world is in turmoil yet `getting by' without him. His greatest friends have long forgotten him while the love of his intergalactic life has moved on, now with a child and a husband to boot. Technically speaking, his return is without merit.However, things seem to change for the worst when Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) also has his share in the homecoming. After evading a double life sentence, Luthor has plans for global domination--literally. He visits Superman's fortress, steals the invaluable alien crystals, and discovers a magnificent hidden truth inside that is damaging to both Superman and the world.So in the end, yeah, the world starts the Superman hype again.Taking on the heroic role of revitalizing the series, director Singer picks up the franchise where Richard Donner and Richard Lester's previous work respectively left off. This means ignoring the ill fortuned Superman III and IV, both films becoming too reliant on the gimmick rather than the story.Everything here is back to the basics plus one.Returns sports the same original theme conceived by John Williams, this time Singer's favorite composer John Ottman takes the reigns. By the time the theme picks up pace and the blue retro-terrific titles fly past the screen, you might want to pinch your arm and remind yourself that this is still 2006 and not 1978.Effects aside, the film retains the magic and aura of the original entry with newcomer Brandon Routh filling in and gracefully replacing the late Christopher Reeve's tights and boots. He is enigmatic, spunky, and fortunately for the role of Clark Kent he is unbearably clumsy. Routh is Superman, delivering lines like ""Good night, Lois"" as if they're straight from the audio files that have collected dust for over twenty years now.Supporting Routh at his side are Kate Bosworth as the ill-tempered journalist Lois Lane and the energetic and screen stealing Kevin Spacey who looks to be having just the right amount of fun as the arch nemesis Luthor. For Bosworth, this role is a long stretch from the surfer hey-day she came from nearly four years ago but she nails it with the right expressions and a perfect pitch.Even Margot Kidder should be proud...Spacey, on the other hand, portrays Lex Luthor as he should be. This is of course the same role originally staged by Gene Hackman. Yet instead of the forcibly awkward casting of Hackman, Spacey takes the character and soars to heights that might rival that of the caped crusader.Gene Hackman might bite his lip at this one.The film clocks in at two and a half hours which might welcome or daunt the audiences for the next coming month. Considering modern epics of the likes of King Kong or The Lord of the Rings series sport running times of three to four hours, it might be safe to say that moviegoers should be more than happy.A longer running time allows the film to stretch, to explore, and to expand the storyline that might otherwise be constricted in anything shorter. Singer even takes a cue from director Peter Jackson's work by upping the characterization and organizing outlandish, superior action sequences over breathtaking settings.It's times when the almighty caped one struggles that the film really shines. Never once do the action sequences seem overly done or outwardly jutting from the storyline. The thing works and blends so smoothly that there's no fruit to be left at the bottom.The dialogue is snappy, the chemistry is modern science, and the effects succeed on a level of believability and boyhood wonder. This is a film for everyone that wants a film for themselves. For those looking for a hero that they'd rather look up to than relate to, Superman Returns delivers the package right on time.It just might have taken twenty years and counting in the process.",5,"""Why The Cinema Needs Superman""",1151452800,"06 28, 2006",2006,4806,"['nearly', 'twenty', 'years', 'Superman', 'triumphantly', 'screen', 'save', 'day', 'moviegoer', 'theater', 'owners', 'looking', 'golden', 'entertainment', 'might', 'not', 'hurt', 'studio', 'producers', 'too', 'let', 'keep', 'Supes', 'back', 'popcorn', 'be', 'made.Director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'X-Men', 'dusty', 'beat', 'up', 'franchise', 'literally', 'sinks', 'teeth', 'class', 'written', 'much', 'director', 'previous', 'work', 'really', 'surprise', 'blessing', 'disguise.After', 'last', 'year', 'schizophrenic', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'year', 'laughable', 'most', 'X-Men', '3', 'Last', 'Stand', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'follow', 'suit', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'comic', 'book', 'filmmaking', 'just', 'screen', 'film', 'what', 'do', 'simply', 'it.More', 'anything', 'film.Brandon', 'Routh', 'deliciously', 'Clark', 'Kent/Superman', 'awkwardly', 'second', 'home', 'planet', 'Earth', 'world', 'turmoil', 'yet', 'getting', 'greatest', 'friends', 'have', 'long', 'forgotten', 'love', 'intergalactic', 'life', 'moved', 'now', 'child', 'husband', 'boot', 'Technically', 'speaking', 'return', 'merit.However', 'things', 'seem', 'change', 'worst', 'when', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'also', 'share', 'homecoming', 'evading', 'double', 'life', 'sentence', 'Luthor', 'plans', 'global', 'domination', 'literally', 'Superman', 'fortress', 'invaluable', 'alien', 'crystals', 'magnificent', 'hidden', 'truth', 'damaging', 'Superman', 'world.So', 'end', 'yeah', 'world', 'Superman', 'hype', 'again.Taking', 'heroic', 'role', 'revitalizing', 'series', 'director', 'Singer', 'up', 'franchise', 'where', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'Richard', 'Lester', 'previous', 'work', 'respectively', 'left', 'off', 'ignoring', 'ill', 'fortuned', 'Superman', 'III', 'IV', 'films', 'becoming', 'too', 'reliant', 'gimmick', 'rather', 'story.Everything', 'here', 'back', 'basics', 'one.Returns', 'sports', 'same', 'original', 'theme', 'conceived', 'John', 'Williams', 'time', 'Singer', 'favorite', 'composer', 'John', 'Ottman', 'reigns', 'time', 'theme', 'up', 'pace', 'blue', 'retro-terrific', 'titles', 'fly', 'screen', 'might', 'want', 'pinch', 'arm', 'remind', 'still', '2006', 'not', '1978.Effects', 'aside', 'film', 'magic', 'aura', 'original', 'entry', 'newcomer', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'filling', 'gracefully', 'replacing', 'late', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'tights', 'boots', 'enigmatic', 'spunky', 'fortunately', 'role', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'unbearably', 'clumsy', 'Routh', 'Superman', 'delivering', 'lines', 'Good', 'night', 'Lois', ""'re"", 'straight', 'audio', 'have', 'collected', 'dust', 'twenty', 'years', 'now.Supporting', 'Routh', 'side', 'are', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'ill-tempered', 'journalist', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'energetic', 'screen', 'stealing', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'who', 'be', 'having', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'fun', 'arch', 'nemesis', 'Luthor', 'Bosworth', 'role', 'long', 'stretch', 'surfer', 'hey-day', 'came', 'nearly', 'four', 'years', 'ago', 'right', 'expressions', 'perfect', 'pitch.Even', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'should', 'be', 'proud', 'Spacey', 'other', 'hand', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'should', 'be', 'course', 'same', 'role', 'originally', 'staged', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'instead', 'forcibly', 'awkward', 'casting', 'Hackman', 'Spacey', 'character', 'soars', 'heights', 'might', 'rival', 'caped', 'crusader.Gene', 'Hackman', 'might', 'bite', 'lip', 'one.The', 'film', 'clocks', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'might', 'welcome', 'daunt', 'audiences', 'next', 'coming', 'month', 'Considering', 'modern', 'epics', 'likes', 'King', 'Kong', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'series', 'sport', 'running', 'times', 'three', 'four', 'hours', 'might', 'be', 'safe', 'say', 'moviegoers', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'happy.A', 'longer', 'running', 'time', 'film', 'stretch', 'explore', 'expand', 'storyline', 'might', 'otherwise', 'be', 'constricted', 'anything', 'shorter', 'Singer', 'even', 'cue', 'director', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'work', 'upping', 'characterization', 'organizing', 'outlandish', 'superior', 'action', 'sequences', 'breathtaking', 'settings.It', 'times', 'when', 'almighty', 'caped', 'one', 'film', 'really', 'shines', 'Never', 'once', 'do', 'action', 'seem', 'overly', 'done', 'outwardly', 'jutting', 'storyline', 'thing', 'works', 'blends', 'so', 'smoothly', 'fruit', 'be', 'left', 'bottom.The', 'dialogue', 'snappy', 'chemistry', 'modern', 'science', 'effects', 'succeed', 'level', 'believability', 'boyhood', 'wonder', 'film', 'everyone', 'film', 'looking', 'hero', ""'d"", 'rather', 'look', 'up', 'relate', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'package', 'right', 'time.It', 'just', 'might', 'have', 'taken', 'twenty', 'years', 'counting', 'process']",N/A

This movie had it's strong points and it's weak points. One of the movie's strong points is Brandon Routh's performance as Superman. Routh portrays the character very well. The character truly feels like Superman and is very convincing in his role as hero. I especially liked the scenes where Superman saves the airplane and lands it in the baseball stadium and when the bullet bounces off of Superman's eye. You see the Superman character with all the powers and abilities you'd expect. Kevin Spacey's performance as Lex Luther was also fantastic. Luther is a convincing villain who feels like a real threat. And of course John Williams Superman score is fantastic. But there are also some noticeable negatives. 1 of the worst negatives about Superman Returns is that it's WAY too romance/love story centric. (The almost complete lack of romance is 1 of the many things I really appreciate about Man of Steel.) This weakness is actually overstated by some of the 1 star reviews. It's not as though the movie is just romance/love story and there's nothing more to it than that,as some 1 star reviews seem to suggest. But there is way too much of this and the high amount of it causes this to not be a great movie. Another weakness is the lack of action. While the action that is in the movie is exciting and well done,there just isn't enough of it. (Man of Steel has a much more satisfying level of action.) The story/plot is so-so. Not the greatest,not the worst. At the end of the day this movie is a very mixed bag. The cast,music,and special effects are great. But the lack of action and the romance/love story heaviness of this movie make it unsatisfying. Superman Returns is worth seeing but is not a film that can be watched over and over again. 3 out of 5 stars.",3,A mixed bag,1372636800,"07 1, 2013",2013,1874,"['loved', 'Man', 'Steel', 'gave', 'well', 'deserved', '5', 'stars', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'much', 'more', 'mixed', 'bag', 'movie', 'had', 'strong', 'points', 'weak', 'points', 'One', 'movie', 'strong', 'points', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'performance', 'Superman', 'Routh', 'character', 'very', 'well', 'character', 'truly', 'feels', 'Superman', 'very', 'convincing', 'role', 'hero', 'especially', 'liked', 'scenes', 'where', 'Superman', 'airplane', 'baseball', 'stadium', 'when', 'bullet', 'Superman', 'eye', 'see', 'Superman', 'character', 'powers', 'abilities', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'performance', 'Lex', 'Luther', 'was', 'also', 'fantastic', 'Luther', 'convincing', 'villain', 'who', 'real', 'threat', 'course', 'John', 'Williams', 'Superman', 'score', 'fantastic', 'are', 'also', 'noticeable', 'negatives', '1', 'worst', 'negatives', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'WAY', 'too', 'romance/love', 'story', 'centric', 'almost', 'complete', 'lack', 'romance', '1', 'many', 'things', 'really', 'appreciate', 'Man', 'Steel', 'weakness', 'actually', 'overstated', '1', 'star', 'reviews', 'not', 'movie', 'just', 'romance/love', 'story', 'nothing', 'more', '1', 'star', 'reviews', 'seem', 'suggest', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'high', 'amount', 'not', 'be', 'great', 'movie', 'weakness', 'lack', 'action', 'action', 'movie', 'exciting', 'well', 'done', 'just', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Man', 'Steel', 'much', 'more', 'satisfying', 'level', 'action', 'story/plot', 'so-so', 'Not', 'greatest', 'not', 'worst', 'end', 'day', 'movie', 'very', 'mixed', 'bag', 'cast', 'music', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'lack', 'action', 'romance/love', 'story', 'heaviness', 'movie', 'make', 'unsatisfying', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'worth', 'seeing', 'not', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'over', 'again', '3', '5', 'stars']",N/A
1023609,AW99SBGWEXP0J,B000J10EQU,Michael Zuffa,"[2, 3]","Superman (Routh) is back, five years after where ""Superman II"" left off.  He returned to Krypton, hoping to find some life still there, but when he found nothing, he returned to Earth.  As Clark Kent, he gets his job back at the Daily Planet, and is reunited with Lois Lane (Bosworth).  But, people have moved on.  Lois has a five year old son, and a boyfriend (Marsden).  She has also won a Pulitzer for an article about how the world does not need Superman.  Elsewhere, Lex Luthor (Spacey) is free from prison, and up to no good.  It seems that he has found Superman's Fortress of Solitude, and has devised a plan with what he found there that will wipe out most of the United States.  Once again, Superman must try to stop Luthor's evil scheme, and try to win the girl in the process.  But things will be a little more difficult this time.After almost two decades, Superman is finally back.  Bryan Singer takes the helm as director after bowing out of the X-Men franchise.  Not the wisest move, but it is the opportunity of a lifetime to bring back the Man of Steel.  He does a few things right.  First, he uses the backstory established in ""Superman"" and ""Superman II"", wisely ignoring ""III"" and ""IV"", and not having to do a complete reboot.  He attempts to have a look of continuity and even uses John Williams' famous themes from those films.  This IS the Superman we grew up with, he has just been away for a while.  Kevin Spacey is great as Luthor, bring menace and some humor to the role.  He even manages to inflict some pain on the hero.  On the weak side, Lex's plan is dumb.  For as smart as he is supposed to be, he has not really thought things through.  Kate Bosworth is weak as Lois, and James Marsden has the unenviable role of being the other man.  Brandon Routh does not bring much to the table as Superman/Clark Kent except a resemblance to Christopher Reeve.  Finally, the running time is way too long to support the story.  Some trimming could have improved the story's flow.Yet, for the most part, it works.  It is good to see Superman back after all these years.  The effects are top notch, and the movie is mostly fun.  I do recommend this movie, but I hope that the filmmakers are able to tighten things up the next time around.  A sequel is planned (duh), and could be better than this restart.

1023610,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B000J10EQU,Micheal Hunt,"[5, 6]","I thought this sequel could've been a lot better then what it is, like many of today's sequels & remakes of classics, they put all there time and effort into the effects they can do now that they couldn't do back when the originals where made and after that they decided to try & write a script around it.PLOT: Superman has left the planet and hasn't been seen for years since the last movie, apparently he left the planet because astrologers thought they had found his planet of Krypton, so he went to see for himself only to return to say it wasn't there to his Earth mother who they may as well have not included in the movie as she plays in scenes that aren't relevant to the story and she has nothing to do with anything in this movie.So Superman's back, he discovers Lois Lane had moved on with her life and settled down, gotten married and had a kid. Lex Luther managed to get out of his life sentence and has managed to steal the crystals of Superman's arctic home and use them for world domination. So Superman has to come back and save the day while feeling unloved.... boo-hoo.I didn't enjoy the storyline to this one, I think they tried to show Superman's heartbreak over discovering Louis was married and had a kid, but quite frankly i never felt for him at all, nor did I feel one bit sad for him at the end of this movie with what happens or feel touched by his words to his so...mthing ... and I think they where trying to show that Superman excepted the husband, but man, that needed a huge re-write to tell it better along with so much else that you can pick up on and say ""I get it"" but I doubt anyone could say they felt it.The whole thing doesn't have the feel of the 70's/80's versions that this is a sequel to. There is just way too many visual effects, too much sickening CGI that is not needed to tell a story, I couldn't adjust to the characters not even resembling the original actors, and I suppose they did some ground breaking CGI effects and showed things that wasn't possible in the other movies, but again, use them to a well written plot instead of making a movie around the CGI.For the first half of the movie I was a bit confused not being able to work out what the hell was happening, I guess it all kind of made sense by the end, and speaking of the end, as I predicted, leave it as a set-up for a sequel.I didn't like the way the movie started, it was slow, confusing and boring, the middle kind of picked up a bit and became a little bit better, then the ending just had no satisfaction at all, an end to a superman movie should be climactic, not just be over and done with then fly around for 5 minutes.And another thing about the CGI, what is with this greyish looking fog thing all over these days' movies? War Of The Worlds did the same thing, have producers and moviemakers in Hollyweed got something against using more then 5 colours these days? Why can't they add some bright colours? Why cant trees be green and oceans be blue? Why do they almost have to be grey and dark all the time with fake fog and mist all over the place? It might be a work of art to those developing it, but give us a break and try and do something that looks real and doesn't make you nauseous for crying out loud.Bottom line is, this film was made simply by going to Warner and someone saying, ""hey we can do more visually now then what we could back then with Superman, here is an hours worth of CGI, what do you say we cash in and make some money out of it? Don't worry about the plot or acting or a good script, you know the title alone will be gold""",2,Not a super movie,1167264000,"12 28, 2006",2006,3577,"['thought', 'sequel', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'then', 'what', 'many', 'today', 'sequels', 'remakes', 'classics', 'put', 'time', 'effort', 'effects', 'can', 'do', 'now', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'back', 'when', 'originals', 'where', 'made', 'decided', 'try', 'write', 'script', 'it.PLOT', 'Superman', 'left', 'planet', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'years', 'last', 'movie', 'apparently', 'left', 'planet', 'astrologers', 'thought', 'had', 'found', 'planet', 'Krypton', 'went', 'see', 'only', 'return', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'Earth', 'mother', 'who', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'not', 'included', 'movie', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'relevant', 'story', 'nothing', 'do', 'anything', 'movie.So', 'Superman', 'back', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'had', 'moved', 'life', 'settled', 'down', 'gotten', 'married', 'had', 'kid', 'Lex', 'Luther', 'managed', 'get', 'life', 'sentence', 'managed', 'steal', 'crystals', 'Superman', 'arctic', 'home', 'use', 'world', 'domination', 'So', 'Superman', 'come', 'back', 'save', 'day', 'feeling', 'unloved', 'boo-hoo.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'storyline', 'one', 'think', 'tried', 'show', 'Superman', 'heartbreak', 'discovering', 'Louis', 'was', 'married', 'had', 'kid', 'quite', 'frankly', 'i', 'never', 'felt', 'did', 'feel', 'one', 'bit', 'sad', 'end', 'movie', 'what', 'feel', 'touched', 'words', 'so', 'mthing', 'think', 'where', 'trying', 'show', 'Superman', 'excepted', 'husband', 'man', 'needed', 'huge', 're-write', 'tell', 'better', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'say', 'get', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'could', 'say', 'felt', 'it.The', 'whole', 'thing', ""n't"", 'have', 'feel', ""70's/80"", 'versions', 'sequel', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'visual', 'effects', 'too', 'much', 'sickening', 'CGI', 'not', 'needed', 'tell', 'story', 'could', ""n't"", 'adjust', 'characters', 'not', 'even', 'resembling', 'original', 'actors', 'suppose', 'did', 'ground', 'breaking', 'CGI', 'effects', 'showed', 'things', 'was', ""n't"", 'possible', 'other', 'movies', 'again', 'use', 'well', 'written', 'plot', 'instead', 'making', 'movie', 'CGI.For', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'was', 'bit', 'confused', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'work', 'out', 'what', 'hell', 'was', 'happening', 'guess', 'kind', 'made', 'sense', 'end', 'speaking', 'end', 'predicted', 'leave', 'set-up', 'sequel.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'way', 'movie', 'started', 'was', 'slow', 'confusing', 'boring', 'middle', 'kind', 'picked', 'up', 'bit', 'became', 'little', 'bit', 'better', 'then', 'ending', 'just', 'had', 'satisfaction', 'end', 'superman', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'climactic', 'not', 'just', 'be', 'over', 'done', 'then', 'fly', '5', 'minutes.And', 'thing', 'CGI', 'what', 'greyish', 'looking', 'fog', 'thing', 'days', 'movies', 'War', 'Worlds', 'did', 'same', 'thing', 'have', 'producers', 'moviemakers', 'Hollyweed', 'got', 'something', 'using', 'more', 'then', '5', 'colours', 'days', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'add', 'bright', 'colours', 'Why', 'cant', 'trees', 'be', 'green', 'oceans', 'be', 'blue', 'Why', 'do', 'almost', 'have', 'be', 'grey', 'dark', 'time', 'fake', 'fog', 'mist', 'place', 'might', 'be', 'work', 'art', 'developing', 'give', 'break', 'try', 'do', 'something', 'real', ""n't"", 'make', 'nauseous', 'crying', 'out', 'loud.Bottom', 'line', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'simply', 'going', 'Warner', 'someone', 'saying', 'hey', 'can', 'do', 'more', 'visually', 'now', 'then', 'what', 'could', 'back', 'then', 'Superman', 'here', 'hours', 'worth', 'CGI', 'what', 'do', 'say', 'cash', 'make', 'money', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'plot', 'acting', 'good', 'script', 'know', 'title', 'alone', 'will', 'be', 'gold']",N/A
1023611,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B000J10EQU,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[0, 3]","Does the world need a Superman? That is precisely the very question executives at Warner Brothers studios and X-Men director Bryan Singer are trying to answer this summer with the release of the highly-anticipated Superman Returns which they hope will be received with a resounding `Yes' from the American public. Fans of the `Man of Steel' have for years clamored for the world's greatest superhero to make a triumphant return to the silver screen in light of the shameful Superman IV: The Quest for Peace which was both a critical as well as a public failure for Warner Brothers. And although producer Alexander Salkind diligently tried in vain to resurrect the film franchise with Superman: The New Movie, using the Superboy television series to get the proposal off the ground, nothing came to fruition. Warner Brothers spent fifty-million dollars in pre-production alone and went through as many as three directors including Batman director Tim Burton, Charlie's Angels director McG and Rush Hour director Brett Ratner. Ironically enough it was Ratner who departed the Superman Returns project to take up X-Men: The Last Stand, a sequel to the successful X-Men film franchise Bryan Singer abandoned for Superman Returns. Among the nine writers tapped to pen the screenplay for the fifth installment in the Superman series, Clerks director Kevin Smith who used `The Death and Life of Superman' storyline for his screenplay and Alias and Lost creator/producer J.J. Abrams who despite a preemptive drubbing of his screenplay by Ain't Cool News' a movie gossip website, is responsible for suggesting that critical elements of the Superman mythology be reintroduced to a new generation, not to mention whose screenplay cancelled out the disastrous Batman v. Superman project, are the better known ones. With an astronomical production budget of over two-hundred million dollars (this figure has since been greatly disputed by numerous sources and more likely the actual figure stands at an estimated one-hundred and fifty million dollars), a lot of pressure has been placed on the shoulders of Bryan Singer, more even then what was placed on him for the X-Men franchise, to make Superman Returns a success.The story for Superman Returns is unequivocally the most intricate aspect of this movie to pinpoint and thoroughly analyze. First off, it is far from what some, namely aging movie critic Roger Ebert, would describe as being a complete and utter disaster. At the same time however the script does fail to invoke the sense of enthusiasm and grandeur seventeen years of bent up fan anticipation and/or frustration, not to mention the prodigious marketing force behind the project, would lead us to believe. It may be that it relies too heavily on the principal elements of the original Superman movie. This is not however necessarily a bad thing as it was writer/producer J.J. Abrams who intended to revisit these exact components in his draft of the Superman screenplay so that they might be reintroduced to a new generation unfamiliar with the entire Superman mythology. Warner Brothers' marketing team did too good of a job promoting Superman Returns, creating exorbitant expectations that could never realistically be met, at least as far as the first film is concerned. Superman Returns, in the same vein as the original Spider-Man and X-Men films, is merely the stepping stone which sets the stage for its characters and future storylines they'll follow. At the very least it can be described as disappointing.It is unfair to compare Brandon Routh's performance as the `Man of Steel' to the late-actor Christopher Reeve. Even before his untimely death due to a heart attack his performance as Superman in the 1978 original was viewed as iconic in cinematic history, a far cry to be sure from the Batman franchise with the sole exception being Michael Keaton which would still be a matter of some debate. Routh succeeds in making the role his own and not relying too heavily on Reeve's example to affect his performance onscreen. Routh has charm and charisma that's for sure but it felt as though the audience was left a little short changed when it came to Superman himself.Kate Bosworth is easily the greatest miscast of the film in the role of Superman's love interest Lois Lane. The astringent lack of credentials in her relatively short filmmaking career work against her in this pivotal role. The sole exception of course being Beyond the Sea directed by co-star Kevin Spacey who recommended the young actress to director Bryan Singer when he was cast as Lex Luthor. It is difficult to put a finger on the problem precisely but there is just something about her that doesn't quite feel right. In addition to her hair color, her whole performance comes off as artificial.Kevin Spacey is exquisitely sadistic yet still charming as Superman's arch-nemesis Lex Luthor. He truly appears as though he had a lot of fun in this role. This works to both the benefit of Spacey's overall performance and the audience's viewing experience. For example, when Lois Lane argues with Lex Luthor that his plan to use the crystals from Superman's lair to create an entirely new continent and in the process destroy all of North America will kill millions of people, Luthor callously interjects, ""Billions! Once again, the press underestimates me"". This is one of the rare instances in which Superman Returns surpasses the expectations laid down by the original Superman movie. Spacey brings to the role of Lex Luthor a level of enthusiasm that vastly exceeds Gene Hackman's performance thirty years ago.Kal Penn, best remembered for his comedic performances in National Lampoon's Van Wilder and Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, is highly underutilized in this film as Stanford, one of Lex Luthor's goons. He's easily recognizable among teenagers and young adults so his one-line performance which is said off-screen seems a tad off.Overall, Superman Returns, while not the movie of the year, let alone of the summer season, as all the fan boy hype and studio marketing power made it out to be, marks a brilliant and long overdue reemergence for this once faltering franchise. If nothing else director Bryan Singer should be credited for that. That said however it does have its shortcomings. There are lapses in conventional logic as with any comic book movie but nothing to be finicky about. What is rather difficult for anyone, let alone a hardcore comic book `geek', to swallow is the idea of Superman leaving Earth for five years, saying goodbye to Lois Lane or not, and all because some group of scientists claimed they found remnants of a planet called Krypton, the Man of Steel's home planet. If Superman knows that his planet was destroyed, why investigate? And why did it take him five years? It has been seventeen years since the last Superman movie. Furthermore, considering Alias creator/producer J.J. Abrams original draft for the fifth Superman project was rejected by Bryan Singer on the basis that it was too controversial among fans of the comic book series, it is therefore a bit perplexing to say the least that there has been so little fan uproar over the concept of Superman and Lois Lane having a son. With Superman seen as a Christ-like figure it is essentially sacrilege (a page taken from The Da Vinci Code controversy) for him to have a child. Even if this is the extreme in describing the scenario it at least shouldn't sit right with fans. And while the flashback of a young Clark Kent discovering his abnormal abilities (lightening fast speed, flying, etc.) is a joy to behold, it does nothing to advance the plot and would have been better spent left on the cutting room floor. One-hundred and fifty-four minutes is to say the least a tad excessive even when resurrecting a superhero franchise but according to sources (a current roommate who is friends with the Man of Steel Brandon Routh) a lot was cut from the film so it could have been a lot longer. Regardless, there is very little to complain about. The computer-generated special effects are simply astonishing, most of all the remarkable Boeing 747 sequence, with none of them feeling out of place or incomplete. While Metropolis may be a fictional place set within the confines of the DC comic book universe, director Bryan Singer successfully brings it to life, projecting a sense of realism onto the audience and yet still keeping it staunchly within the realm of romanticism and grandeur. But most importantly of all the sequences of dialogue, manipulated by computer-effects wizards behind the scenes, with the late-actor Marlon Brando, scenes that were shot originally for Superman II, are what make this movie great. As you are watching the movie you begin to ask yourself, with Superman as Earth's disposal so to speak, why do we still have to worry about Osama Bin Laden, North Korea, or Iran? As Jor-El explains as we see Superman hovering above the Earth, floating in space, Kal-El (Superman) can be a savior for man kind but he can't do everything. There are issues such as Islamic terrorism, international conflicts, geopolitical disasters etc. that humanity itself has to deal with on its own. While it would be easier for a Superman to resolve it for us, we as a collective would not gain anything from that. At the core of humanity there is the capacity to do good, we only lack the light now and then to show us the way. That is Superman's true purpose. On the surface Superman Returns is an often long-winded, heavily character driven superhero drama, but given time beyond the first film, remember - Spider-Man and X-Men were the same when they first started out, it can be capable of great things.",4,The Moose Hole - Superman: Resurrection,1152835200,"07 14, 2006",2006,9704,"['world', 'need', 'Superman', 'precisely', 'very', 'question',

1023615,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000J10EQU,mirasreviews,"[1, 2]","""Superman Returns"" picks up the cinematic tradition of Superman after ""Superman: The Movie"" (1978) and ""Superman II"" (1980), ignoring the ill-conceived, campy Superman III & IV movies. We have a new Superman (Brandon Routh), who abandoned his love affair with Lois Lane and his adopted planet to search for his history in the ruins of Krypton. Returning after a 5-year absence, he resumes his reporting  job at Metropolis' ""Daily Planet"", disguised as mild-mannered Clark Kent. Still pining for star reporter Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), Clark finds that she has taken up with the boss' nephew Richard White (James Marsden), with whom she has a young son. Lex Luther (Kevin Spacey), however, has not abandoned his old ways. Out of prison once again, he plans to become the ultimate real estate mogul by replacing North America with his own brand new continent, aided by crystals he has stolen from Superman's Fortress of Solitude.I think fans will rank ""Superman Returns"" lower than Superman I & II but higher than the other sequels. The story is fine. Kevin Spacey and Parker Posey, as Lex Luther and his bubble-headed mistress, are sufficiently heavyweight thespians to inject some laughs into the adventure without undermining it. Brandon Routh makes a beautiful superhero, and I think that returning to a young image was probably smart. This is an entertaining movie with a few conspicuous flaws: The action sequences are the least satisfying aspect of the film. They seem compulsory and flat. Lois Lane is bland. She doesn't have enough personality to keep our interest, much less Superman's. Kate Bosworth is clearly too young for the role -though I suspect that is to avoid having Lois look older than the new, youthful Superman. And, at 2 hours 34 minutes, this movie is too long. More interesting action and a more forceful Lois Lane would have saved ""Superman Returns"" from mediocrity. As it is, a marginal 3  stars.The DVD (Warner 2006 single disc): No bonus features.

The story, the acting, and the characters all fall very flat.  It has some good effects and action scenes, but not enough to make-up for a poor story, or lack-there-of.The characters do not work at all for me.  Brandon Routh is just a poor imitation of Christopher Reeve.  He definitely looks the part, which is why the studios hired him.  I also like the Superman costume in this movie.  However, Routh does not have any of the charm and charisma that Reeve had.  I do not care for this Superman either.  He is very stoic and broody and is not very proactive.Kate Bosworth does a horrible job as Lois Lane.  She does not look the part, nor does she have any of the spunkiness that Margot Kidder had.  Kevin Spacey does a decent job as Lex.  Lex does come off as more of a threat in this movie, which is nice.  However, he is still mostly played-up for laughs like the famous WRONG scene.  He also makes some of the same mistakes he did in the previous movies.  James Marsden has really a nothing role in this.  I do not understand why he left X-Men 3 for this.  The rest of the cast is alright but nothing great.The story is the biggest gripe for me.  The story is very drawn-out and boring.  Superman returns to Earth then really not much happens for a while.  It took a very long time for things to get off the ground.  The film throws in some action scenes (though good action scenes) to distract the audience from the fact that they do not have story to tell.  The ending is a lot like the ending of the first Superman movie.  The big threat is kind of underwhelming.  Here is no big super villain to fight but Lex Luthor again.The effects are very good.  This movie has some of my favorite action scenes of all the live action movies like the plane scene which everyone remembers.  The action is easily the best aspect of the picture.Overall I like that they tried to bring back Superman to the big screen after twenty years.  However, good intentions do not trump execution.  I hope the new film The Man of Steel is better than this.

Comic book hits like ""Spiderman,"" ""Batman Begins"" and Bryan Singer's ""X-Men"" films thrived and fostered on the darker, deformed sides of their eponymous superpowered warriors and the weighty themes of their stories.  And usually, the films were tremendous, as superhero, comic book flicks grew and matured beyond the juvenile stereotypes that the general public had for them.  But, for a while, it seemed we would no longer buy into heroes who were earnestly virtuous, and who did righteous deeds because they felt they had a responsibility to a higher cause.But then, ""Superman Returns"" rolled around.  And even though it bears a couple nagging flaws, the most glaring of which is a somewhat sluggish pace, ""Superman Returns"" is by far one of the most ravishing, bustling and joyous films in years.  Its' by equal turns exciting and romantic, and in a refreshing change of pace, director Bryan Singer does not drive his film with angst, but with sincerity.  Not only will you believe again that a man can fly (the special effects and set pieces are spectacular), but that a man can be unambiguously moral.  The biggest triumph of this new ""Superman"" is it reminds all of us that it just might be possible to be Supermen on our own.The film opens with the return of Superman (Brandon Routh, ably filling the shoes of the late Christopher Reeves) after a five year search to find the devastated remains of his homeworld.  Back in Metropolis, the Man of Steel, tries to reconnect with Lois Lane (a superb Kate Bosworth), only to find she has moved on to a new man (James Marsden) with whom she has sired a child.  But in the background, the malevolent Lex Luthor (a smarmy, gleefully vicious Kevin Spacey) has bought his way out of prison to fashion a new scheme to kill Superman and conquer the world.Singer, and his writers Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris, work hard, and succeed, to reestablish Superman for a new generation by first and foremost breathing new life into the romance between Supes and Lois Lane.  Routh and Bosworth are dynamic as two star-crossed lovers learning to how to relate to one another again and their performances yield emotional, heartfelt dividends.  Meanwhile, Spacey, a Singer Veteran from ""The Usual Suspects,"" has a ball as Lex Luthor, happily chewing scenery with the efficiency of a born baddie.

I enjoyed this film, not as much as I had hoped for but still as superhero movies go it's up there, nowhere close to the spiderman franchise, maybe right next door to the Fantastic 4, entertaining, fluffy but not very filling. Personally i think Brandon Routh did his best to portray a character that diehard and may I say fanatical people will always associate with Christopher Reeve, Reeve did his version I say give Routh the chance to step up to the challenge and not be forever in Reeve's shadow.As for Lois Lane, horrible the casting was bad , enough said.  Kevin Spacey is a great actor , no denying that, but Luthor needs a little more than being dark and sarcastic, he needs that kind of presence that makes you believe this guy would smile in your face as he chokes the life out of you, like Hackman did so well. Obviously the flying scenes were pretty good, with the help of CGI you could believe this guy was flying around Metropolis.

This did not reak of the political message and weakness of the ill fated Superman IV, and it did not have the camp comedy of Superman III.  With that being said, this was a truly wonderful movie for children as well as adults.  Why didn't it make such an impact?  There were a couple of reasons maybe.Forgoing Superman III and IV, this movie continued where Superman II left off.  Superman left the earth in a futile search.  Scientists thought that they had found his long lost home planet of Krypton, and he has, like the title says, returned after a five year absence.  Assuming his alter ego of Clark Kent, he returns to his old job at the Daily Planet to find that the world has moved on.  Lois Lane, his love, has moved on.  She is engaged to be married to Perry White's son Richard and they have a young son.  She even won a Pulitzer Prize for her piece, ""Why the World Doesn't Need Superman"", much to his chagrin.  And yes, there was a HUGE hole in this.  If we were to forget Superman III and IV, we were also to forget the fact that at the end of Superman II he gave her that magic kiss where she forgot that she knew his true identity, but she left her pregnant with his child.  And - SPOILER ALERT - when this movie begins, she knows that her son is actually Superman's but still doesn't know that Superman is actually Clark Kent.  And it just so happens that Lex Luthor (played with all the panache of a wonderful, delightful Kevin Spacey - who brings the right amount of evil and humor to this role) has also returned with one of his infamous plots to overtake the world.Why didn't this movie fly?  The obvious references to Superman being a Jesus figure are there, but then again it is a metaphor for the Holy Trinity - Jor-El is the father, Clark Kent is the son, Superman is the Holy Spirit who protects us.  It was ALWAYS like that, it was not created just for this movie.  Kate Botsworth as Lois Lane looks a bit too young to have had such a history with Superman nor anyone else.  And Brandon Routh?  Many said he was lousy, but he was a wonderful Superman.  Was he too stiff?  Not really, he was just right.  Not perfect, but he was wonderful as Superman, having to once again rescue all of us from all the horrible things that we can and can't do to each other.  Because the world needs a savior, and he is our savior.  Superman is the best of who we are, who shows us that we are all heroes, all a great people who can make the world a better place.

These doubts were only reinforced by some fairly negative responses in this part of the world. Not to mention the fact that the movie had some big shoes to fill following on from the movies with Christopher Reeve.As already mentioned, some of the events are borrowed heavily from the previous Superman movies. Of particular note is the scene where Lane and Superman fly together, the crashing of Superman to earth at the beginning and a few other points. However, enough was original to keep it from being purely a re-run. Luthor getting out of prison because the prosecution's prime witness had legged it, (or rather flew the coop), was a nice touch.The computer graphics are probably what stands out, and their quality is fairly good. The special effects are excellent, though you can still tell the CGI when you see it. It is detailed and very well done. Superman's flight sequences are particularly good.The movie has a good pace to it, and it will not leave you looking at the watch. It has a good story line, with Luthor finding out about Krypton and all their technology. I have to admit, Kevin Spacey makes a good Lex Luthor.Overall, I liked this movie. I would not say that it left me breathless, but there is something about Superman that always wins the day. It was a good reprise of the character and a good night's entertainment.

I'm going to review the picture quality and the overall presentation of the disc...But if I had to review the movie, I would give it a 6/10.  The movie was ok, but for a fan like me whose been obsessed with this film for years, checking updates on the movie, watching the videos of Bryan Singer during production, posting on BlueTights.net forums, I WAS SEVERLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE FILM.  But, like I said, I'm not going to review the movie.  Anywayz, I had to get the movie on HD because I am a Superman fan.  I have a PS3, and it was my first HD movie.  I don't see why everybody here is giving such praise on the quailty of the video.  The video wasn't top notch and I would not use this as a demo to show off.I'm using a HDMI cable, so I'm getting 1080p.  The video is very soft and doesn't look HighDef to me.  The film crew used HD cameras to film the movie, but I don't see that result in this transfer.  I'm very sure if I pop in the DVD version, I will get the same detail (this is an assumption).  When I watch HighDef, I want to say ""WOW"" sometimes, and that is how I know this is HighDef (ex. Spider-Man 3 or Planet Earth).  I did not get that with Superman Returns.  I mean, it is a clean transfer, but what exactly is so highdef about it?  One scene that I can maybe show you an example is the time we see Lex's yacht in the ocean during the storm in the beginning of movie when they are searching for the Fortress of Solitude, right after the scene where we see Superman fainting in Martha Kent's arms and we get that wide shot of the ship in Smallville.  The scene of the yacht in the ocean was sooooooo soft and there was no HighDef detail whatsoever.  I want to see the wrinkles, and amount of craters on everybody's faces for me say ""Wow, now this is High Definition"".I can't review the audio since I don't have a sound system.I love the extras, and I love the fact that it's on the same disc as the movie.  It's a BluRay, it has the capacity..... why not?  Some movies don't do that for some reason, and if they don't, than why do they even mention the amount of capacity.  Anywayz, the extras are great, they go into great detail about the preproduction, post production, and casting.  I wish they included the Bryan Singer's blogs, but hey, no complaint here on extras.Conclusion, an ok transfer of the film which I don't see me using as a demo for HIGHDEF.  But, is it a must buy, for a Superman fan.... yes, but for a non fan or somebody that greatly hated the film....... I still say buy because it's SUPERMAN.",2,Superman Returns (BluRay) Review.....

Clocking in at 2hrs and 40 minutes, you might think this was 'The Godfather'! This movie has two serious flaws....it's not much fun and it's very boring at times. They don't even have the excuse of getting the origin out of the way. This is supposed to be a sequel....right? Why do Lois and Clark look younger now than they did 20 years ago in the first two movies? I know it is only 5 years time in movieland, but they look like they are ten years younger not 5 years older. Jimmy Olson still looks like a high school kid though.Brandon Routh had some big shoes to fill and the truth is, the kid does a pretty good job imatating Reeves....maybe too good, it only made me miss him all the more. Kate Bosworth's Lois is flat and without the quirky charm of Margot Kidder. There are several silly action scenes too....Superman gets blasted with a gigantic gun that could blow holes in a battleship and when there is no effect on him, the thug pulls out a hand gun and shoots him with that too!(OK the bullit in the eye was pretty cool!) The action scenes are very well done, but the scenes with Superman and Lois floating around are not romantic, but yawn inducing! I also found it ridiculous that Lois's body would stay perfectly and effortlessly straight horizonally while flying with Superman, just by having his arm loosely around her waist.I know this is a comic book movie, but if you are trying to make the characters realistic, then I'm going to question these types of things. Some good news is the new Superman costume is cool. With some serious editing this could have been a great film as there are some good ideas in this uneven comic film.

1023630,A3GFP6QUQH8DRN,B000J10EQU,"Mr. Loco ""follow me at twitter @locdasmoke""","[1, 1]","A lot of people have been bashing this movie, but me personally as a long time Superman fan since before I could walk, this movie was great! Brandon Routh reminded me so much of Christopher Reeve in so many ways and I really liked how this movie kept the original sound track and connected to Superman 2. Now yeah I know there's a 3 and 4, but this movie feels like the real Superman 3. I also liked Kevin Spacey's take on Lex Luthor, he did a really good job, he felt evil and I think if anybody was to take Gene Hackman's role, Spacey was the right pick. I don't get why the studios ditched a sequel for this movie and I think that Bryan Singer did a great job making his movie as a nod to Richard Donner's original vision! This is a great Superman movie for those who loved the Christopher Reeve movies and those who like the 80's feel of superhero movie. This is not a movie for those who are looking for a Dark Knight or Iron Man type of movie, so if you're looking for one of those kind of movies, skip it and also I recommend watching Superman 1 and 2 before watching this movie as well! It makes a lot more sense when you do it that way. If you don't like this movie and don't agree with my views on it, don't mind commenting, because I already know there's quite a lot of people who didn't care for this movie, but there are those who did and I am one of them! I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars and the only reason I'm not giving it a 5 is because I would've liked to see a little bit more action, but really I'm not trippin about that at all.",4,I grew up with the Christopher Reeve Superman movies and this movie feels just like one of the classics,1360713600,"02 13, 2013",2013,1553,"['lot', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'bashing', 'movie', 'personally', 'long', 'time', 'Superman', 'fan', 'could', 'walk', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'reminded', 'so', 'much', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'really', 'liked', 'how', 'movie', 'kept', 'original', 'sound', 'track', 'connected', 'Superman', '2', 'Now', 'know', '3', '4', 'movie', 'real', 'Superman', '3', 'also', 'liked', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'take', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'did', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'felt', 'evil', 'think', 'anybody', 'was', 'take', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'role', 'Spacey', 'was', 'right', 'pick', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', 'studios', 'ditched', 'sequel', 'movie', 'think', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'movie', 'nod', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'original', 'vision', 'great', 'Superman', 'movie', 'who', 'loved', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'movies', 'who', 'like', '80', 'feel', 'superhero', 'movie', 'not', 'movie', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Iron', 'Man', 'type', 'movie', 'so', ""'re"", 'looking', 'one', 'kind', 'movies', 'skip', 'also', 'recommend', 'watching', 'Superman', '1', '2', 'watching', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'lot', 'more', 'sense', 'when', 'do', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'views', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'commenting', 'already', 'know', 'quite', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'movie', 'are', 'who', 'did', 'am', 'one', 'give', 'movie', '4', '5', 'stars', 'only', 'reason', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', '5', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'see', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'action', 'really', ""'m"", 'not', 'trippin']",N/A
1023631,A2UD8A6JDZ8L4M,B000J10EQU,"Mr. Mike ""Sci Fi Guy""","[1, 1]","I am a huge fan of the original Superman movies and obviously like any real fan I ignored the existence of Superman 3 & 4 since they were despicable garbage.  So, when this came out I figured OK, this is what Superman 3 should have / could have been. I went into it with the right mindset and realized that with all new actors and actresses that things were gonna be a little different.  I was actually OK with the casting changes for the most part.So, where to begin?  The storyline and ""plot"" were fairly cool with the crystals at the center of Luthers ploy. I enjoyed the scenes where Luther experiments with the power of the crystals.  These objects have been at the centerpiece of the film since the beginning so it was great seeing them being an integral part of this movie....NICE!  Speaking of Luther, Kevin Spacey did a pretty good job with the character.  This version of Luther was a little more sinister and not quite as ""witty"" as the Hackman versions but this was an acceptable change. Luther in this film was more of a real villian so to speak since he was a ""darker"" character.Kate Bosworth tried but just didnt cut it as Lois Lane.  That charcater has Margot Kidder written all over it and its not really Ms Bosworths fault... she just couldnt ""revive"" the Lois character for me. She was not as silly, loveable, or as interesting as the orginal.  What else can I say?  It just didnt work.  Brandon Routh was also a little out of place here. He was off just enough to make me miss Chris Reeve (RIP) and at times he appeared bored with the whole thing.  They could have worked with him more on playing the characters of Clark and Superman as they were quite different and this was missing somewhat in this film.  Routh wasnt awful by any means and he does look a lot like Reeve, it just missed the mark by enough to be noticed.  The rest of the cast was OK, nothing great but nothing terrible either.The CGI and effects were a mixed bag as usual with movies these days.  Some of the CGI worked well and sometimes it just looked like a video game. The problem with CGI is that its just soooooo obvious when its being used that it takes away from the realism of a scene because you KNOW that its totally computerized.  In the old days, we didnt know exactly how things were done so we were able to just watch the special effects and the mystery of how they ""did that"" kept us guessing.  Now, just about every shot with any kind of effects is CGI and it has that 2-dimensional, lifeless look to it that I have trouble with.  Oh well....There are a few surprises but most you could see coming a mile away. Still though, it did add some intrigue to the Superman saga and how his future may unfold. Plus, the ending is open enough that a lot more could happen and we may even see another film in this series someday.Overall, Brian Singer did a solid job with this film and thats saying a lot since things like this usually never get off the ground and are pretty awful.  Not so, its definitely worth a watch and after seeing it you can decide if its worth adding to your collection.  I might get it just to add it to my Superman 1 & 2 collection.",3,"Not bad, not great either but at least worth a watch for fans....",1172534400,"02 27, 2007",2007,3155,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'original', 'Superman', 'movies', 'obviously', 'real', 'fan', 'ignored', 'existence', 'Superman', '3', '4', 'were', 'despicable', 'garbage', 'So', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'figured', 'OK', 'what', 'Superman', '3', 'should', 'have', '/', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'went', 'right', 'mindset', 'realized', 'new', 'actors', 'things', 'were', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'little', 'different', 'was', 'actually', 'OK', 'casting', 'changes', 'most', 'part.So', 'where', 'begin', 'storyline', 'plot', 'were', 'fairly', 'cool', 'crystals', 'center', 'Luthers', 'ploy', 'enjoyed', 'scenes', 'where', 'Luther', 'power', 'crystals', 'objects', 'have', 'been', 'centerpiece', 'film', 'beginning', 'was', 'great', 'seeing', 'being', 'integral', 'part', 'movie', '.NICE', 'Speaking', 'Luther', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'character', 'version', 'Luther', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'sinister', 'not', 'quite', 'witty', 'Hackman', 'versions', 'was', 'acceptable', 'change', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'real', 'villian', 'so', 'speak', 'was', 'darker', 'character.Kate', 'Bosworth', 'tried', 'just', 'didnt', 'cut', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'charcater', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'written', 'not', 'really', 'Ms', 'Bosworths', 'fault', 'just', 'couldnt', 'revive', 'Lois', 'character', 'was', 'not', 'silly', 'loveable', 'as', 'interesting', 'orginal', 'What', 'else', 'can', 'say', 'just', 'didnt', 'work', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'was', 'also', 'little', 'place', 'here', 'was', 'off', 'just', 'enough', 'make', 'miss', 'Chris', 'Reeve', 'RIP', 'times', 'appeared', 'bored', 'whole', 'thing', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'more', 'playing', 'characters', 'Clark', 'Superman', 'were', 'quite', 'different', 'was', 'missing', 'somewhat', 'film', 'Routh', 'wasnt', 'awful', 'means', 'look', 'lot', 'Reeve', 'just', 'missed', 'mark', 'enough', 'be', 'noticed', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'OK', 'nothing', 'great', 'nothing', 'terrible', 'either.The', 'CGI', 'effects', 'were', 'mixed', 'bag', 'usual', 'movies', 'days', 'CGI', 'worked', 'well', 'just', 'looked', 'video', 'game', 'problem', 'CGI', 'just', 'soooooo', 'obvious', 'when', 'being', 'used', 'away', 'realism', 'scene', 'KNOW', 'totally', 'computerized', 'old', 'days', 'didnt', 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'things', 'were', 'done', 'so', 'were', 'able', 'just', 'watch', 'special', 'effects', 'mystery', 'how', 'did', 'kept', 'guessing', 'Now', 'just', 'shot', 'kind', 'effects', 'CGI', '2-dimensional', 'lifeless', 'look', 'have', 'trouble', 'Oh', 'well', 'are', 'few', 'surprises', 'most', 'could', 'see', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'Still', 'did', 'add', 'intrigue', 'Superman', 'saga', 'how', 'future', 'may', 'unfold', 'ending', 'open', 'enough', 'lot', 'more', 'could', 'happen', 'may', 'even', 'see', 'film', 'series', 'someday.Overall', 'Brian', 'Singer', 'did', 'solid', 'job', 'film', 'thats', 'saying', 'lot', 'things', 'usually', 'never', 'get', 'off', 'ground', 'are', 'pretty', 'awful', 'Not', 'so', 'definitely', 'watch', 'seeing', 'can', 'decide', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection', 'might', 'get', 'just', 'add', 'Superman', '1', '2', 'collection']",N/A

Being a fan of his work on the first two X-Men films, Bryan Singer is an excellent choice to helm the silver screen return of the classic super hero, but sadly, the film never reaches the lofty heights that it sets out to attain.  Newcomer Brandon Routh is a great choice as the Man of Steel, who returns to Earth after a five year absence to find that Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) has moved on, as has the rest of the world.  The one person who hasn't truly moved on however, is Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) who has his own diabolical plans, including one that Superman might not be able to stop.  Routh is good, Spacey is a hoot, Bosworth is a bit miscast, and the rest of the cast, including James Marsden, Frank Langella, Parker Posey, Kal Penn, and Sam Huntington, are quite good.  The story, crafted by Singer and his X2: X-Men United cohorts Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris, is a bit predictable but offers some nice surprises while paying homage to Richard Donner's 1978 original film, and unlike many comic book films, has actual heart to it.  The special effects are spectacular, and as a whole the film is better than I had anticipated.

There's no excuse for me to be able to say that about a movie like this.Why didn't they go more in depth with the characters? It's not as if the screen time was used up by action scenes, since that was nonexistent. They could've had some interesting subplots with Lois' husband, as well as the son. The ingredients were all there. There could've been some interesting conflict between the husband and Superman, but they didn't explore that one bit.Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane. Yeah that works. I haven't done all the research, so I'll gladly be corrected if I'm wrong, but I believe that it is impossible for a human being to possess less charisma than she did in this movie. What a dreary, dead-eyed, lifeless dry rag she was. An open can of ravioli by Chef Boyardee has more charisma than she did, empty or not.

1023638,A1UGBHFRUDNYD1,B000J10EQU,"Nenah Sylver ""Nenah Sylver, PhD, author""","[14, 27]","Superman has a rich history. From the Silver Age comics and George Reeves TV shows, to Christopher Reeve films and the more recent Lois & Clark TV series, there's a high caliber of talent, story lines, and photography to strive for. Unfortunately, Superman Returns contains none of these.Here is the simple plot, other than the ending which out of courtesy I won't spoil for you. Superman left earth for 5 years to visit what was left of his destroyed planet Krypton, and has now suddenly returned. Lois is mad at him, barely remembers Clark Kent, and has a boyfriend and a son. Lex Luthor, who was broken out of prison, has stolen a crystal from Superman's fortress (whose whereabouts he knew from a 1980s Chris Reeve film). The crystal can build massive dark towers rising from the sea, which will ultimately threaten the entire planet, including Metropolis, with earthquakes and total destruction. Lex's goal is to build himself a new island with these land masses, and of course kill Superman.Viewers are asked to accept that Superman didn't say goodbye to Lois first before leaving earth. Superman would never not say goodbye to Lois, given their relationship; but the writers needed this to happen so she would be angry at him and find a new lover, which is intrinsic to the plot. We are asked to accept that Superman is still in love with Lois. Yet his actions don't support this. We are asked to accept that Lois hardly remembers Clark Kent, Superman's other identity. But this completely ignores 60+ years of the Superman mythos. The writer appears to have used Superman as a vehicle to advance his own story, which essentially has nothing to do with Superman.Kate Bosworth is miscast as Lois Lane. Often wimpy, she lacks the fire and verve that made this character a great reporter. Bosworth is much better suited to the role of mother. Brandon Routh is adequate, given the few lines he has to work with; there are even moments when he shines. A sensitive chap, he nicely imitates Chris Reeve's Clark Kent. But he doesn't exhibit enough mental and emotional strength we have come to expect from Superman; and his physique and looks simply aren't Superman material. The best acting job is from Kevin Spacey, who plays Lex Luthor. Parker Posey, who does a great job as Luthor's girl friend, would have made a good Lois.The camera moves much too quickly at times, making one dizzy. The sets are dark and dismal and uninviting. The considerable footage of noisy destruction is s-o-o-o boring. Some heavy editing, to whittle down the mayhem by a good 30 minutes, would have served the film greatly.The ending is unrealistic and untrue to who the characters were supposed to be. Despite the use of Jor-El's voice from a previous Chris Reeve movie, there was little continuity in the Superman story line. The one excellent feature is the well done, realistic flying scenes. You feel as though you're right there in the sky with Superman.This was a most disappointing experience. Even for a Superman fan like myself, there was little to redeem this film.",1,"Implausible plot, mediocre acting and script.

1023643,A1129LM24YWSZV,B000J10EQU,"Nicole Bradshaw ""Nicole Bradshaw""","[3, 4]","Superman Returns was cast pretty well. Newcomer Brandon Routh was very convincing as the Man of Steel. He certainly looks the part, and I thought he was as believable as a caped, flying, invincible man could be. Kate Bosworth was inoffensive but unremarkable as Lois Lane. Kevin Spacey and Parker Posey turned in solid performances as Lex Luthor and Kitty Kowalski. James Marsden again plays ""the man the leading lady doesn't love"" as Richard White. (It's getting to be a habit with him - The Notebook, X-Men - he plays the nice, cute guy that doesn't really get the girl. Will somebody please stop typecasting this dude? James Marsden deserves love, too!! I'm tired of seeing him disappointed on the big screen!) The CGI effects were great, with scenes of Superman in space, saving airplanes, etc., being particularly visually arresting.I think that I had a few problems with the script, though. First of all, the movie is VERY slow to start. The first twenty minutes are awfully choppy, with WAY too much exposition. Basically, I wanted to get to the part where we see Brandon Routh in the Superman suit, to see if this new guy was going to give us a Superman we could believe. Well, I did, and he is, but the movie took far too long to get us there.Secondly, I think that Superman did a few things in this movie that are very contrary to the general public's idea of what Superman should be doing. First of all, it behooves me to set this up: In Superman Returns, Lois Lane is engaged to another man, and she has a son. Superman, under the cover of night, flies to her house (which she shares with her little family) and uses his X-ray vision and super-hearing to spy on a private conversation she's having in the kitchen. WHAT? Superman is NOT a peeping tom, for crying out loud! According to the iconography of the Superman myth, the story we've been telling and listening to about Superman for 50 years, this is really incompatible. Also, later, Superman visits Lois Lane on the roof of the Daily Planet building. Even though he knows she's engaged to someone else, he moves to kiss her, and she stops him. I don't think the Superman I know would be kissing on someone who is already engaged to another man. I don't know, I just felt that, in many ways, this movie tried to dismantle parts of the shiny clean image of Superman. It was incongruent, and I'm not sure I liked it.I think the whole point of these scenes may have been to make Superman look more human, more falliable. For example, in a scene where Superman has been weakened by Kryptonite, we see him get worked over by a few worthless henchmen. And not just a few jabs to the stomach. I mean, we see Superman crawling through dirty water, running away from these two-bit thugs. It was a very disturbing image, because the American public doesn't think of Superman that way. Director Bryan Singer really took some chances, playing with such an iconic brand like this.Anyway, I definitely think the movie is worth seeing, although not a slam dunk. I will bar any final judgements about this new endeavor to resurrect the Superman franchise until I see how future movies play out.",4,Still Super after all these years . . . ?,1169942400,"01 28, 2007",2007,3146,"['Superman', 'Returns', 'was', 'cast', 'pretty', 'well', 'Newcomer', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'was', 'very', 'convincing', 'Man', 'Steel', 'certainly', 'part', 'thought', 'was', 'as', 'believable', 'caped', 'flying', 'invincible', 'man', 'could', 'be', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'was', 'inoffensive', 'unremarkable', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'turned', 'solid', 'performances', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Kitty', 'Kowalski', 'James', 'Marsden', 'again', 'man', 'leading', 'lady', ""n't"", 'love', 'Richard', 'White', 'getting', 'be', 'habit', 'Notebook', 'X-Men', 'nice', 'cute', 'guy', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'girl', 'Will', 'somebody', 'please', 'stop', 'typecasting', 'dude', 'James', 'Marsden', 'love', 'too', ""'m"", 'tired', 'seeing', 'disappointed', 'big', 'screen', 'CGI', 'effects', 'were', 'great', 'scenes', 'Superman', 'space', 'saving', 'airplanes', 'etc.', 'being', 'particularly', 'visually', 'arresting.I', 'think', 'had', 'few', 'problems', 'script', 'though', 'First', 'all', 'movie', 'VERY', 'slow', 'start', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'are', 'awfully', 'choppy', 'WAY', 'too', 'much', 'exposition', 'Basically', 'wanted', 'get', 'part', 'where', 'see', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'Superman', 'suit', 'see', 'new', 'guy', 'was', 'going', 'give', 'Superman', 'could', 'believe', 'Well', 'did', 'movie', 'took', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'get', 'there.Secondly', 'think', 'Superman', 'did', 'few', 'things', 'movie', 'are', 'very', 'contrary', 'general', 'public', 'idea', 'what', 'Superman', 'should', 'be', 'doing', 'First', 'all', 'set', 'up', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'engaged', 'man', 'son', 'Superman', 'cover', 'night', 'flies', 'house', 'shares', 'little', 'family', 'X-ray', 'vision', 'super-hearing', 'spy', 'private', 'conversation', 'having', 'kitchen', 'WHAT', 'Superman', 'NOT', 'peeping', 'tom', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'According', 'iconography', 'Superman', 'myth', 'story', ""'ve"", 'been', 'telling', 'listening', 'Superman', '50', 'years', 'really', 'incompatible', 'Also', 'later', 'Superman', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'roof', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'building', 'Even', 'engaged', 'someone', 'else', 'kiss', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Superman', 'know', 'would', 'be', 'kissing', 'someone', 'who', 'already', 'engaged', 'man', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'just', 'felt', 'many', 'ways', 'movie', 'tried', 'dismantle', 'parts', 'shiny', 'clean', 'image', 'Superman', 'was', 'incongruent', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'liked', 'it.I', 'think', 'whole', 'point', 'scenes', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'make', 'Superman', 'look', 'more', 'human', 'more', 'falliable', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'Superman', 'been', 'weakened', 'Kryptonite', 'see', 'get', 'worked', 'over', 'few', 'worthless', 'henchmen', 'not', 'just', 'few', 'jabs', 'stomach', 'mean', 'see', 'Superman', 'crawling', 'dirty', 'water', 'running', 'away', 'two-bit', 'thugs', 'was', 'very', 'disturbing', 'image', 'American', 'public', ""n't"", 'think', 'Superman', 'way', 'Director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'really', 'took', 'chances', 'playing', 'iconic', 'brand', 'this.Anyway', 'definitely', 'think', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'not', 'slam', 'dunk', 'will', 'bar', 'final', 'judgements', 'new', 'endeavor', 'resurrect', 'Superman', 'franchise', 'see', 'how', 'future', 'movies', 'play', 'out']",N/A

I thought he did a good job as Kent/Superman-mainly because he was seriously channeling Reeve's performance.  As far as Lois, Bosworth was a little on the young side and she didn't bring anything unique to her character, but her performance didn't turn me off either.  The film did bite off a little too much from the first Superman and when it did it one too many times I was irritated.  The Plot...well, all right I didn't understand the master plot.  But Lex Luther and his henchmen obviously were the inspiration to such cartoons like Pinky and the Brain.  What are we going to do tomorrow?  Take over the world.  Speaking of not bringing anything new to the table what happened to Spacey?  He used to bring such chrisma and presence to the screen.

I went to see this movie simply because I wanted to see if today's technology/CGI/special effects could add a better/different dimension to the Superman films of the past.  I think the answer is easily yes.  Though some of the special effects are far from flawless, most of it is pretty darn good.The movie itself is an entirely different story.  What trips this movie up time after time is its reliance on the old Superman movies that starred Christopher Reeves.  I have to agree with the reviewer that said:""The young actor playing Superman? He's not bad at all, really. But he doesn't play Superman; he does an impression of Christopher Reeve doing Superman.""I couldn't put it any better myself.  There were plenty of moments in the movie that made me roll my eyes, but none were as bad as when Brandon Routh (Superman) stops a plane from crashing and then quoting a line from the original movie word for word about ""flying being the safest way to travel.....statistcally speaking.""  Kate Bosworth mails in a pretty hollow rendition of Lois Lane and her ""husband"" (what part of the storyline is that?), played by X Men star James Marsden (Cyclops), is equally as cardboard as Bosworth is.There are great moments all throughout the movie that do manage to overshadow the points stated above.  Great special effects, a pretty good job by Kevin Spacey, and Superman having a son (thus leaving room for a sequel) are probably the most intruiging aspects of the movie.  The action is pretty good, but don't expect a two and a half hour thrill ride; it simply will not happen.  I think the most excited I got was when the trailer for Spider Man 3 came on.  Superman was done well, but it did leave a lot of room for improvement.  As far as religious conotaions, only if you were reading too far into the movie would you find those kinds of things.  The characters were way too lifeless for it to be deliberate.  As far as special effects go, I believe you will get your money's worth.Bottom line: Superman Returns had potential to be great.

I loved Superman and Superman II but the series went downhill with Superman III and IV: The Quest For Peace putting the nail in the coffin. But even though Superman 3 and 4  were awful they were more entertaining in their badness than this movie. Bryan Singer made X-Men and X2-X-Men United sizzle on the big screen. But where he succeeded in X-Men he fell on his face here. The whole plot is that Superman(played by Brandon Routh) returns after searching for some so-called remains of his home planet. He comes back a bitter Lois Lane(played by Kate Bosworth)who is upset that he left without saying goodbye. In the meanwhile Lex Luthor(played by Kevin Spacey) finds Superman's hideout and steals his crystals with a peculiar scheme in mind: use the crystals to create a land mass that is practically inhabitable(as you find out later in the movie).Opinion: I dont know where to start when criticizing this movie but here goes nothing. Brandon Routh is bland as Superman/Clark Kent. Christopher Reeve brought some type of charm to his role as Superman while Brandon Routh is just there. Another mistake is Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane. She's bland and doesnt have the spunk that Lois Lane is known for. On a positive side Kevin Spacey is perfect as Lex Luthor(he's no Gene Hackman but he'll do).  Parkey Posey's brainless character ""Kitty"" provides some laughs which break the moments of boredom this movie causes. When they're not on the screen, the movie just drags on and on which brings me to my next point: Superman Returns moves at a really slowwwwwwwwww pace. There's hardly any action and even though the special effects are good and Metropolis is nice to look at the movie still feels longer than it has to be. Another complaint is the movie insults the intelligence of its viewers and leaves them with a lot of questions to ask like: If Lois Lane's son was strong enough to kill one of Luthor's goons with a piano than why couldnt he get himself and his mother out of the pantry? How can Superman lift a whole island made up of kryptonite(his Archilles heel)when he had trouble handling Luthor's henchmen on this same island? Why would Lex Luthor, Superman's clever foe come up with such an idiotic idea such as making an island no one can live on? Why would Superman leave withou saying goodbye to Lois Lane? Wasnt he the same one who was willing to give away his powers to be with Lois Lane? Who's bright idea was it to cast Harold of Harold & Kumar fame as one of Luthor's henchmen. You get the drift.

After watching it myself I have to say that I am left feeling disappointed at what could have been a terrific film. The sound and special effects are first class as would be expected. However, the plot and the characters are poorly conceived. My biggest complaint is that the characters are all two dimensional. Superman struts his stuff as the ultimate alpha male, exuding confidence and calm, physically and emotionally impermeable. In other words there is very little about him with which mere mortals can identify.I like to see at least a little vulnerability in my heroes. And I am not talking about the inevitable kryptonite scene which leaves Superman on death's door. I am talking about struggles such as Spiderman's soul searching quest to discover whether he even wants to don his spider suit again. I understand that Superman is supposed to be the epitome of perfection. However, surely after the gripping and engaging characters in X-Men and Spiderman the writers could have done a better job with this one.The ultimate test is to gauge audience reaction as Superman is about to die. Sadly, the scene does not engage me at any emotional level. Prior to this, the film does very little to foster emotional attachment to its main protagonist. I have read stories about people crying but I think this is more due to their attachment to Superman as a great American icon, rather than any particular connection with Superman as depicted in this film.

But it really missed the mark in several areas.  The first is that it was a little too true to the original Christopher Reeve movies.  That was 20+ years ago and most people probably don't remember those movies or what happened in them.  Even if they did, it's okay to re-imagine the mythology of Superman (like Batman Begins, which did an excellent job of creating an origin for the Dark Knight).  Another thing is that they kept the campiness of the original movies.  Making Luthor some clownish villain detracts from his ability to be a real threat to Supes.  The Luthor on the Smallville TV show is actually a more interesting, layered character.Second thing...to put it as kindly as possible, the actors sucked.  Kate Bosworth looks like she's acting in a high school play.  Terrible miss-casting.  She doesn't look like she's old enough to drive let alone have a 5 year old son.  Routh does a great Christopher Reeve impersonation...if only that were the goal.  He brings nothing new to the role.  Superman could be one of the most interesting dramatic characters of the comic world.  A being raised in a humble family, with the powers of a god.  Think about the conflict that he could be feeling with simple morality... lots of dramatic meat for future stories, maybe...Last complaint - the film has no sense of where it lies in time.  Jimmy is still wearing his bow tie, the fashion and some of the set pieces seem like they're pulled out of the 20's, but they have shuttles and computers.Okay, so the good things... great special effects, good action, good potential for sequels.

Screenplays where rejected and revised more than you or I have had hot dinners. Nicolas Cage was touted to play the man in red underwear. Then everything went flat. Spiderman came out and ruled. So naturally we waited for Hollywood to pump out the one that started it all. Summer 2006, Superman is here, and starts with an introduction where we get the same title effects of the 70s version with some CGI planets thrown in. All is looking good until Kevin Spacey stands around for minutes on end, looking old & bald, and saying ""Wait for it"" while nothing much impressive happens. The Marlin Brando scenes we all heard about do not exist except for a brief 5 second screen image that is superimposed on a crystal... and that is it. Superman returns from his debacle across the cosmos because he heard his planet had been spotted. Lois Lane has a kid. Kent goes to work in the Daily Planet. There is a power cut and Superman saves a plane from crashing, the best special effect in the movie is 20 min into the film! Between the twiddling-of-your-fingers, Kevin Spacey saying ""Wait"", and Superman sulking about Lois having a kid, you want something to happen and it does... Superman flies with Lois around the world to violin music. At the point you know something has gone terribly wrong and you know the direction that Singer is taking you. You will not be wasting your time getting up and going to watch X3 instead in the other screen. Secretly I just wanted Superman to let Lois fall. Heck, anything to just keep us awake. After the violin-playing flying around, Lois meets Lex Luther and he tells her that is going to take over the world by creating a super sized country in the ocean. There is then a terrible plot twist involving children that will make you balk, scenes with a plane flying around and a shipwreck just to have Superman pull people out of a sinking vessel (what was that all about???) and then a Superman Lex fight sequence involving kryptonite that begs to ask why Superman didn't detect something sooner. And it is not as if the Superman Returns makers thought much out either... this is a thorough no-brainer with many ""what"" questions asked, between Spacey's ""wait"" from start to finish. Even fans of Superman I, II and III will be scratching their heads. Not since Ang Lee's The Hulk has there been such a mess of the Superhero franchise. Thank God for Sam Raimi and Spiderman. Even Batman Begins got the emotional balance right. Sadly Singer's Superman Returns is a terrible, terrible, terrible untidiness, a wasted Kevin Spacey and asks us to just eat up whatever is slapped onto the canvas. And 3 hours of it. Give me a break. I want Superman, not Supersulk! This isn't what we waited 20-30 years for! I feel like Kathy Bates in Mysery and want to stand up and shout at the screen! Very Sadly, instead of preventing the trainwreck, Superman just became one.",1,"It is a bird? Is it a plane?

It's pretty obvious that Brandon Routh can't act. Bryan Singer barely gave him any lines at all and when he did speak, it was wooden. Brandon most likely got the part because he looked the part. But it probably would have been wiser to go with someone who can act. The storyline is just terrible. If and when there is a next one, it should start out with Superman waking up and everything that happened in this movie was all just a dream. He should not have a son. People don't want to see Superman as a daddy. And the kid has absolutely no purpose in this film. Other than throwing a piano. And Lois Lane's boyfriend is a drag. Lex Luthor is handled very poorly. He somehow figures out a way to raise an island from out of the ocean which will then flood much of the world and kill ""billions."" Well...the island does come up out of the water but nobody is flooded at all. There's one little wave and that's it.

1023659,A3SH2OT200EUO6,B000J10EQU,"Paul G. Bens, Jr.","[2, 3]","There was a good idea lurking in Superman Returns, unfortunately it is saddled with bad casting, mediocre acting and a pace that is deadlier than Kryptonite.Director Bryan Singer truly was doing an homage to the original Christopher Reeve Superman films (the first two...he, like the rest of us just want to forget Superman 3 & 4) and his love for those films permeates this new incarnation. He reuses the original theme, the Lois/Superman love theme and raises Jor-El from the dead by using footage of Brando from the first film. There are also winking nods to the original films in the dialog (""""I hope this hasn't put anyone off flying. Statistically speaking, it's still the safest way to travel."") and Superman's first arrival is once again saving a plane. Unfortunately, what Singer's homage does is remind you how excellent the originals were and keeps you wishing that you were watching them instead.Mostly, the problem with Superman Returns is the casting. Brandon Routh as Clark/Superman is adequate at best. He has neither the charm nor the self effacing humor of Reeve in the role. And Kate Bosworth as Lois has absolutely no personality, let alone the spunk and drive that made Margot Kidder's Lois such a great portrayal (and, indirectly, led to Demi Moore becoming a star when General Hospital put out a casting call for a ""Lois Lane/Margot Kidder"" type for their soap, and Moore was their answer to the call.) The overrated Parker Posey stands in for Valerie Perrine in the Miss Teschmacher role (renamed but not retooled for the newest film), and she has none of the natural comic ability that Perrine had. But worst of all is Kevin Spacey yawning his way through Lex Luthor, the ""greatest criminal mind of our time."" Now Lex Luthor is a brilliant character...too brilliant for his own good; yet Spacey has no wit, no charm, no overwhelming sense of hubris that should define the role and which Gene Hackman had skads of in the original pictures. The result...a lackluster performance leading to a lackluster plot.What I liked about the piece is (1) it truly is a sequel (not a ""reinvention"") to the original pictures, (2) it doesn't spoon feed us the stuff that happened in the first 2 movies and (3) the twist with the origin of Lois' son--while not a surprise--had the potential to create some interesting emotional tweaks.The emotional through line is Clark's struggle to know who he is and find family. This is evident by the set up of Brando's dialog lifted from the first movie. Unfortunately, Routh doesn't have the acting chops to carry that through line to the place it needs to go. It is a good attempt by the screenwriters, but Mario Puzo's screenplay for the first film does it so much better (and, honestly, how do you beat Mario Puzo?)I would love to have seen this film made 20 years ago with the original cast, as I think it would have been a nice addition to the legacy with some script and pace tweaking In lieu of that, major casting changes in this version would have helped: Gene Hackman could have reprized his role and raised this to a whole other level. I don't know who I would have chosen for Superman, but Demi Moore would have been an excellent choice for Lois.All in all...not a bad film, but not a particularly good one. It did have potential and if you watch it as an homage to the Reeve films, you'll likely enjoy it more...and then you'll want to watch those films.",3,Watch it as homage to the Reeve films,1249084800,"08 1, 2009",2009,3416,"['was', 'good', 'idea', 'lurking', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'unfortunately', 'saddled', 'bad', 'casting', 'mediocre', 'acting', 'pace', 'deadlier', 'Kryptonite.Director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'truly', 'was', 'doing', 'homage', 'original', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'Superman', 'films', 'first', 'two', 'rest', 'just', 'want', 'forget', 'Superman', '3', '4', 'love', 'films', 'new', 'incarnation', 'original', 'theme', 'Lois/Superman', 'love', 'theme', 'Jor-El', 'dead', 'using', 'footage', 'Brando', 'first', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'winking', 'nods', 'original', 'films', 'dialog', 'hope', ""n't"", 'put', 'anyone', 'flying', 'Statistically', 'speaking', 'still', 'safest', 'way', 'travel', 'Superman', 'first', 'arrival', 'once', 'again', 'saving', 'plane', 'Unfortunately', 'what', 'Singer', 'homage', 'remind', 'how', 'excellent', 'originals', 'were', 'keeps', 'wishing', 'were', 'watching', 'instead.Mostly', 'problem', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'casting', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'Clark/Superman', 'adequate', 'best', 'charm', 'self', 'effacing', 'humor', 'Reeve', 'role', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'Lois', 'absolutely', 'personality', 'let', 'alone', 'spunk', 'drive', 'made', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'Lois', 'great', 'portrayal', 'indirectly', 'led', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'becoming', 'star', 'when', 'General', 'Hospital', 'put', 'out', 'casting', 'call', 'Lois', 'Lane/Margot', 'Kidder', 'type', 'soap', 'Moore', 'was', 'answer', 'call', 'overrated', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'Valerie', 'Perrine', 'Miss', 'Teschmacher', 'role', 'renamed', 'not', 'retooled', 'newest', 'film', 'none', 'natural', 'comic', 'ability', 'Perrine', 'had', 'worst', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'yawning', 'way', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'greatest', 'criminal', 'mind', 'time', 'Now', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'brilliant', 'character', 'too', 'brilliant', 'own', 'good', 'Spacey', 'wit', 'charm', 'overwhelming', 'sense', 'hubris', 'should', 'define', 'role', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'had', 'skads', 'original', 'pictures', 'result', 'lackluster', 'performance', 'leading', 'lackluster', 'plot.What', 'liked', 'piece', '1', 'truly', 'sequel', 'not', 'reinvention', 'original', 'pictures', '2', ""n't"", 'spoon', 'feed', 'stuff', 'happened', 'first', '2', 'movies', '3', 'twist', 'origin', 'Lois', 'son', 'not', 'surprise', 'had', 'potential', 'create', 'interesting', 'emotional', 'tweaks.The', 'emotional', 'line', 'Clark', 'struggle', 'know', 'who', 'find', 'family', 'evident', 'set', 'Brando', 'dialog', 'lifted', 'first', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'Routh', ""n't"", 'have', 'acting', 'chops', 'carry', 'line', 'place', 'go', 'good', 'attempt', 'screenwriters', 'Mario', 'Puzo', 'screenplay', 'first', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'honestly', 'how', 'do', 'beat', 'Mario', 'Puzo', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'made', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'original', 'cast', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'addition', 'legacy', 'script', 'pace', 'tweaking', 'lieu', 'major', 'casting', 'changes', 'version', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'could', 'have', 'reprized', 'role', 'raised', 'whole', 'other', 'level', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'chosen', 'Superman', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'choice', 'Lois.All', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'not', 'particularly', 'good', 'one', 'did', 'have', 'potential', 'watch', 'homage', 'Reeve', 'films', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'enjoy', 'more', 'then', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'films']",N/A

Upon his return he finds his old flame, Lois Lane, now has a fianc&eacute;e and a son to boot. Meanwhile, Lex Luther is at it again with plans to build his own continent out of crystals stolen from the Fortress of Solitude. The ritualistic battle between good and evil ensues with Superman eventually coming out on top.This is not a bad movie as some would indicate, but is by no means a great one. There are many pluses and minuses throughout the film. First of all, this, less even than the other films, is not true to the DC comic's character at all. It is a world that the scriptwriter made, not DC comics. Second, the film covered old ground of Kent growing up and confuses us somewhat. Is this supposed to be a sequel or a remake of the original 1978 film? Third, Lex Luther is again portrayed but does not act as the comic version did - besides, why all the infatuation with Luther? The comics Superman had other villains such as Brainiac. I, for one, would like to see some variety here. Fourth, same old tired sequences of Lois and Superman flying together. C'mon screen writers ... the comics Superman had three (count `em, three) girlfriends and was not this hung up on Lois Lane.And by the way, Let's get the Fortress of Solitude right. In the Superman dogma it is a mountain cavern in the far north with a huge key disguised as an airline marker. No crystalline structure at all. It was more like the Batcave in that it housed Superman's trophies, momento's and the shrunken city of Kandor. I hate the bastardization of the comics I loved as a kid. With today's CGI effects, we can duplicate anything we saw in the comics. The phantom zone for instance (it did not look like someone trapped in a plate of glass .. convicts lived in the real world but as an invisable ghost who could not touch or influence it).Yes, there is some positive here. The film is dark - much darker than any of the other previous chapters. The photography is more compelling thanks to advances in technology. Brandon as a choice for casting is a good one in that we don't have to get used to a different looking Superman/Clark Kent - but he's a little more wooden than Chris Reeves was. Kevin Spacey is good as Lex, but as I said, it's time for a new villain.Technically speaking, there is nothing to find fault with the dvd. The visual is crisp and clear, the audio track superb. Lots of extras on the disk itself.&lt;Sigh>  This should have been a better film, but is tired because of all the ground it is retreading. It is confusing in spots and really stretches believability (Superman and Clark disappear for five years, return at the same time and no one makes the connection? Duh!). Same villain. Same plot. Same action. 32 available as new/used by third party vendors in so short a time after the dvd release should give an indicationBuy it and enjoy, but don't expect anything really great.~pjm~",3,What can be said?

Did I mention the Kryponite was like IN HIS FACE. I'm sorry but no, you can't set up that Kryptonite made his sooo weak and then suddenly change your mind out of convience. I know they tried to make up for it by putting him in the hospital and I respect them for that. They gained an extra star for effot but that's about it. If your someone who just like Superman.

1023662,A1D3XQC2DIT,B000J10EQU,Peter Shermeta,"[8, 12]","Adrenaline. If I had to pick a one-word theme for the movie, that would be it. Edge or your seat, heart-pounding adrenaline. If you have watched the preview for the movie, you may be familiar with a scene involving Superman and an airplane. It is maybe 30 minutes into the movie and I kid you not, they could have ended it right there and I would have paid to see it a second time. That is not to say the movie was downhill from that point on, but it was worth the price of admission, even in the days of increased movie ticket prices.I had heard reports that Superman Returns was too much of a love story and not enough of what we should expect from a Superman movie: Superman fighting crime and saving the day. The (awkward) love story rekindled between our caped hero and Lois Lane was obvious, but not overbearing. There were scenes devoted to it entirely, but this was not the first Superman movie to do it. Let's not forget the rest of the movie, however. Bryan Singer did a great job of incorporating all of Superman's powers over the course of the film. We see plenty of flying, impenetrable skin, super-human strength, heat vision and super breath. But don't leave out the tights and the cape; Superman was well represented throughout the film.I liked how well Brandon Routh maintained the dichotomy of the character he played, selling the Clark Kent secret identity. He stayed clumsy as Clark and was, for the most part, strong and confident as Superman. I was among those in the camp who thought Tom Welling probably should have gotten the part when ""Mr. Unknown"" Brandon Routh was announced. Sorry Tom, but Brandon ended up being a good casting choice. Tom Welling may have been a little too ""teen drama"" and not enough ""comic-book superhero"" for the part.Kevin Spacey is no Gene Hackman, but he did well as Lex Luthor. Watching Lex in action I did have the realization that though I typically prefer Marvel books, I like DC villains much better. My favorites are The Joker (big surprise), The Riddler and Lex Luthor. DC villains, to me, seem much more... complex. Lex Luthor is a bit over the top and he does require some over-acting and forced lines as well as some just-right facial expressions to fully portray his quirks. Spacey kept his composure and I really think he nailed the part.So I really did like the movie, but I did have a few small gripes. You probably would not believe I wrote this if there wasn't a flaw or two pointed out..._Did they make Kate Bosworth look like Natalie Portman on purpose? Or did it just happen naturally? Don't get me wrong, she looked better as Lois Lane than she has in any other role I have seen her in. All I am saying is that after Natalie does a movie or two with a shaved head, maybe Hollywood is trying to snatch her look back from her before she has a chance to make another movie with hair.I love that James Marsden continues to get roles in comic book films as the guy who has the girl who is at least arguably in love with someone else (think Cyclops). I understand he followed Writer/Producer/Director Bryan Singer from the X-Men series to Superman, but he is now sufficiently typecast.Was Brandon Routh's ""Clark Kent"" hair a tribute to Jason Schwartzman?Kal Penn goes from a late night craving for White Castle burgers to playing Lex Luthor's goon? Really? It does not seem like the most natural transition to me. At least I am pretty sure he did not have a single speaking part._Petty criticisms aside, I really liked Superman Returns. The movie had a few slow scenes, primarily right at the beginning, but they served well enough to build up to the climax. The casting was great, even down to Sam Huntington as Jimmy Olsen. I hope I can find time to see it again...in IMAX this time.",4,Ummm....Super!,1153785600,"07 25, 2006",2006,3752,"['Adrenaline', 'had', 'pick', 'one-word', 'theme', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'Edge', 'seat', 'heart-pounding', 'adrenaline', 'have', 'watched', 'preview', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'familiar', 'scene', 'involving', 'Superman', 'airplane', 'maybe', '30', 'minutes', 'movie', 'kid', 'not', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'right', 'would', 'have', 'paid', 'see', 'second', 'time', 'not', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'downhill', 'point', 'was', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'even', 'days', 'increased', 'movie', 'ticket', 'prices.I', 'had', 'heard', 'reports', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'love', 'story', 'not', 'enough', 'what', 'should', 'expect', 'Superman', 'movie', 'Superman', 'fighting', 'crime', 'saving', 'day', 'awkward', 'love', 'story', 'rekindled', 'caped', 'hero', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'was', 'obvious', 'not', 'overbearing', 'were', 'scenes', 'devoted', 'entirely', 'was', 'not', 'first', 'Superman', 'movie', 'do', 'Let', 'not', 'forget', 'rest', 'movie', 'however', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'incorporating', 'Superman', 'powers', 'course', 'film', 'see', 'plenty', 'flying', 'impenetrable', 'skin', 'super-human', 'strength', 'heat', 'vision', 'super', 'breath', 'do', ""n't"", 'leave', 'out', 'tights', 'cape', 'Superman', 'was', 'well', 'represented', 'film.I', 'liked', 'how', 'well', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'maintained', 'dichotomy', 'character', 'played', 'selling', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'secret', 'identity', 'stayed', 'clumsy', 'Clark', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'strong', 'confident', 'Superman', 'was', 'camp', 'who', 'thought', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'part', 'when', 'Mr', 'Unknown', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'was', 'announced', 'Sorry', 'Tom', 'Brandon', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'good', 'casting', 'choice', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'too', 'teen', 'drama', 'not', 'enough', 'comic-book', 'superhero', 'part.Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'did', 'well', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Watching', 'Lex', 'action', 'did', 'have', 'realization', 'typically', 'prefer', 'Marvel', 'books', 'like', 'DC', 'villains', 'much', 'better', 'favorites', 'are', 'Joker', 'big', 'surprise', 'Riddler', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'DC', 'villains', 'seem', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'bit', 'top', 'require', 'over-acting', 'forced', 'lines', 'as', 'well', 'just-right', 'facial', 'expressions', 'fully', 'portray', 'quirks', 'Spacey', 'kept', 'composure', 'really', 'think', 'nailed', 'part.So', 'really', 'did', 'movie', 'did', 'have', 'few', 'small', 'gripes', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'believe', 'wrote', 'was', ""n't"", 'flaw', 'two', 'pointed', '_Did', 'make', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'look', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'purpose', 'did', 'just', 'happen', 'naturally', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'looked', 'better', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'other', 'role', 'have', 'seen', 'am', 'saying', 'Natalie', 'movie', 'two', 'shaved', 'head', 'maybe', 'Hollywood', 'trying', 'snatch', 'look', 'back', 'chance', 'make', 'movie', 'hair.I', 'love', 'James', 'Marsden', 'get', 'roles', 'comic', 'book', 'films', 'guy', 'who', 'girl', 'who', 'least', 'arguably', 'love', 'someone', 'else', 'think', 'Cyclops', 'understand', 'followed', 'Writer/Producer/Director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'X-Men', 'series', 'Superman', 'now', 'sufficiently', 'typecast.Was', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'hair', 'tribute', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'Kal', 'Penn', 'late', 'night', 'craving', 'White', 'Castle', 'burgers', 'playing', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'goon', 'Really', 'not', 'seem', 'most', 'natural', 'transition', 'least', 'am', 'pretty', 'sure', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'single', 'speaking', 'part._Petty', 'criticisms', 'aside', 'really', 'liked', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'movie', 'had', 'few', 'slow', 'scenes', 'primarily', 'right', 'beginning', 'served', 'well', 'enough', 'build', 'up', 'climax', 'casting', 'was', 'great', 'even', 'down', 'Sam', 'Huntington', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'hope', 'can', 'find', 'time', 'see', 'again', 'IMAX', 'time']",N/A

1023665,A3V61K0EF38GP4,B000J10EQU,Philip Scholz,"[1, 1]","The only thing that could have made this film better was if there had been a scene where Christopher Reeve bestowed the Superman suit on Brandon Routh, symbolizing this transition to a new Superman.  Mr. Routh retained so much of Mr. Reeve's iconic portrayal while bringing something new and fresh to the Man of Steel that his work must be applauded.  Same goes for Kevin Spacey as a wonderfully creepy Lex Luthor, though some, like myself, might consider this criminal ""mastermind"" for admission in Arkham Asylum.  Also, Mr. Spacey has this problem that, while being a decent actor, he can never quite leave himself.  No matter what he's doing, you are always aware that it is Kevin Spacey playing the role.  I'm sure there are exceptions to this, but I haven't found them yet.  I had a similar awareness when Gene Hackman was in the role, though this was to a lesser extent with Mr. Hackman.  His girlfriend/henchwoman, Kitty Kowalski, played by Parker Posey, was bland and sometimes stupid to the point where it wasn't even funny.  Frank Langella, playing Daily Planet editor Perry White, gave himself a presence and sense of authority that is needed to make the character work.  I would have liked to see Hugh Laurie play the role as was originally planned, but Mr. Langella's performance was great in its own right.  I wasn't quite thrilled with the storyline involving Lois Lane's fianc&eacute;e and son, but James Marsden and Tristan Lake Leabu made it work.  As for Lois Lane herself, Kate Bosworth picked up the role where Margot Kidder left off with it.  Unlike Brandon Routh, Ms. Bosworth unfortunately did not add anything dramatically new to the role and instead retained Lois Lane's more memorable quirks, such as her bad spelling.  While my feelings about the cast and certain subplots are mixed, the main plot and Lex Luthor's schemes were quite intriguing.  And this film had a certain sense of foreboding that the previous films lacked.  Having Marlon Brando back as Jor-El despite his death two years earlier was also a nice nostalgic touch...it just goes to show you that Hollywood can do just about anything.  Finally, the fact that this film eclipses the plots of Superman III and IV is fine with me, despite the praise I gave to Superman III.  Overall, a fine installment in the saga of Superman...too bad there won't be a sequel.

1023666,ALWB64XOXNMDP,B000J10EQU,Picardfan007,"[2, 5]","Super Spoiler Ahead for those who didn't see the film.  Don't read this if you didn't see the film!Superman Returns was better than the original.  In this version Superman leaves earth for five years to explore the remains of Krypton.  In that time 9/11 occurs.  Lois writes a Pulitzer Prize winning article ""Why We don't need a Superman.""  She eventually develops a relationship with Perry White's son.  We get the impression the offspring is from her bond with her new man.  Although after the first hour we get to see who the son's father really is.There are scenes that make this movie better than the first version.  We don't have Superman changing the course of time to save Lois Lane.  Kevin Spacy plays a much darker and sinister Luther.  Frank Langella portrays the newpaper mogul in a less cartoony fashion that Jackie Cooper did in 78'.  I have to credit the director Bryan Singer for casting a better Lois Lane.  At least this one bears a resemblance to the one in the comics.  Unlike the Lois in Superman: The Movie with Christopher Reeve.There was a controversy behind the 78' version.  The original creators, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster were living in poverty with little or no money to live.  It would have been an embarrassment to Warner Brothers and DC comics if there wasn't a settlement to resolve the matter.DC artist, Neal Adams helped Siegel and Shuster obtain a legal defense to fight the case. Until recently the son of one of the creators passed away.  There is a documentary being produced about how the characters were taken away from the creators.  Back in the 1930s there was little known about copyright law.  Siegel and Shuster sold the rights only to regret that for the rest of their lives.  The recent article about the creators was a sad one.  The family has little or no financial benefit from an icon in American Comics.  Till this day the family is still struggling against DC Comics and Warner Brothers to get some sort of financial restitution after over 60 years.There are those who could say that the family is being greedy in asking for some type of financial gain.  I'd like to see the new documentary reveal the fact that the creators had been robbed of recognition and financial security.I don't know if the same is true in Canada and other countries marketing the new Superman movie; but look at all the merchandise!  I remember long ago when the first film appeared there was no where near the amount of cups, T-shirts and anything that could fit the Super logo on it.I do remember purchasing a $2.25 novel written by E. Nelson Bridewell (from DC Comics). It was an unrelated story that took place in the Superman universe. I never got the chance to read it. From what I've read the novel was one of the better ones.  I was surprised there weren't more.  At the time Marvel was releasing their own versions of prose novels.  The books were written by the popular names of the era; Marv Wolfman, Len (Wolverine CO-creator) Wein, and a few others.One of the commercial tie-in products I purchased were the Justice League Unlimited DVDs.  I wondered why the cartoons were played so late in the evening.  Well, the content is adult and is for older kids.  In one of the episodes Superman is under the influence of a flower alien parasite that controls his mind.  The first scene in his dream state shows his bedroom; with wife Lois Lane. Nothing inappropriate in the way of dialogue, but something I didn't expect to see in what is supposedly a kid cartoon. In the story by comics legend Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons of ""Watchmen"" fame""; Superman sees what his life might have been.  The parasite also gets a chance at Wonder Woman and Batman, but the parasite ends up on the black hat of this episode.  Seeing the villain looked so much like Darkside, I couldn't remember his name. Perhaps it was Mongul or Mogul.The other episodes featured Booster Gold.  Booster is a man who traveled in the past with current inventions and posed them as his own.  To tell you the truth, I stopped reading the comics so long ago, I haven't kept up with the characters anymore.  I just don't have the time.  I do see that the books are oriented to specific age groups more than my generation.  Back in the seventies you'd be lucky if you saw at least three titles with the same hero.  Today there are four, five and even more with the X-Men and Superman.There was a special features section that featured the actors.  The actor who portrayed the Green Lantern, John Stewart was from MAD TV.  It was hard to believe that this fellow had such a deep voice.  And here I thought the actor who played the part was a large guy.  There were other mini features that showed the physics behind Superman's powers.  Superman supposedly flies faster than the speed of sound.  That means video cameras couldn't catch him.  The whole idea of Superman changing in a phone booth is out of date today.  Not in the cell phone era at least.Superman is not the wimpy type that the comics often portrayed him as.  That is one of the aspects the new film touched upon.  Superman was modernized a bit so new audiences could appreciate him.  You could argue that he didn't fight enough for Lois Lane.  However in this film he stood his ground and wasn't a sap in front of Lois.  I did notice how the other actor who portrayed Lois's new beau was Cyclops of X-Men fame.  It looks like he was a contender for the Superman role.The days of skilled pen and ink rendering is gone.  It's created in a computer.  Comics have lost a lot of the nickel, dime charm and technology has taken over.  I like new things, but comics have lost their innocence.  Especially when the books are $2.99 apiece.  It looks like the video games are replacing the regular comics story.  That is why I have purchased the DVD collections of some of the old Marvel Comics.  So far I purchased the first 500 issues of the FF and Spidey and Mad on DVD and CD ROM.  That's enough reading for me for the next 10 years.  I do hope this catches on because I don't have the room to store all those in hard copy.If you like the Super hero cartoons your in for a treat this month.  I just picked up Superman the Animated Series Season 3.  It has 18 episodes with three accompanying directors commentaries.  Bruce Timm has a lot to say about the creation of each show and why decisions were made to streamline them for audiences.  I'd like to see more comics related animation from him.  Each project he's associated with has respect for it's source material.  When Batman: The animated series premiered all those years ago I was expecting a big letdown. I was glad to be wrong.  Comics were part of my childhood long ago and it's good to see that the classic ones are still around.  Although comics are no where near as popular as they used to be, they still have an audience.",5,Superman Returns Better than Ever!!,1152316800,"07 8, 2006",2006,6851,"['Super', 'Spoiler', 'Ahead',

1023667,A1NU6H938LR7I3,B000J10EQU,Pieter Dams,"[2, 4]","Being an 80s kid, I grew up watching the Christopher Reeve Superman movies, so I was a little skeptic about a new film, that obviously couldn't star the late actor. After all, how could anyone else play Superman than him?I have to say, Brandon Routh did a decent job. If we couldn't get Christopher Reeve, he probably was the second best choice. You can tell he was very much influenced by the first 4 Superman movies, either when wearing cape or glasses.Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of Kate Bosworth, who I believe was a very poor choice to play Lois Lane. A 23 year old mother who is the Daily Planet's star reporter? Since Superman has been in outer space for 5 years, that means she was 18 when they were romantically involved. So she would technically still have been in journalism school then...Kevin Spacey on the other hand does an excellent job playing Lex Luther. I was relieved to see the makers have opted to keep the Gene Hackman version and not replace him by some larger than life supervillian.As for the story, this movie is somewhat of a sequel to the 4 Christopher Reeve films. Superman has been away for 5 years, looking for the remains of his home planet Krypton. During that time, Lex Luther has been released from jail, since the Man of Steel neglected to show up in court and Lois Lane has gotten romantically involved with another man and given birth to a son.Luther has once again found his way to Superman's Fortress of Solitude and has stolen one of its crystals in order to wipe the United States out of existence and create a new continent that he can sell to the highest bidder. Sound familiar? In fact, the whole movie is full of references to the first film. It starts off with the exact same opening credits and score and Marlon Brando makes a few appearances from beyond the grave.As for the look, the actors dress like in the 1930s, which, I guess, creates a nice journalistic feel, the Daily Planet's employees being the main protagonists in the movie after all. It also makes for a kind of classic, timeless atmosphere. One thing it does not do, however, is recreate the magic of the first 2 Superman movies, which were set in the glitter and glamour world of the late 70s - early 80s. Lois Lane does not wear shiny evening gowns or live in a Metropolis penthouse, but looks like a (very young) house wife and lives in Wayne Manor. Granted, she's upset with Superman for having left her for five years without even saying goodbye, but there simply is no magic between Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth in the way that there was between Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder. This is clearly visible in the pretty lame flying sequence. Remember ""Can You Read My Mind""? Well, not anymore, I guess. What happened to the lovely night time shots of Metropolis (Manhattan) or the beautiful wide open landscapes of the American West? I'd have thought that in these warlike days, it would have been nice to add a little patriotism to a Superman movie. After all, isn't he supposed to fight for truth and justice in the American way?The special effects aren't all that great either, actually. Superman: The Movie may have been made almost 30 years ago but its flying sequences were a lot more credible than the flashes of red and blue or lame CGI effects that were used in Superman Returns. Christopher Reeve may have ""only"" lifted a helicopter to save Lois Lane in his first public appearance, it still had a much more heroic feel to it than when he threw a rocket into space and landed a plane in a baseball stadium this time around. I can't speak for all Superman fans out there but I did not go: ""Yeah, he's back!"" during the 2 seconds it took him to intercept the plane or his subsequent computerized hovering before the plane's entrance after having saved his favorite journalist.One good aspect, though, is the slow pace, the sets and the music. The Fortress of Solitude and the farm where Clark grew up look and sound exactly the same as in the first 4 films.All in all, I guess you could say the actors, composer and even the director did their best and if we couldn't get another Christopher Reeve movie, I guess this still is a decent effort. Trouble is, the first films were just so magical every other take is bound to leave you feeling a little disappointed.",2,Has he really?,1189555200,"09 12, 2007",2007,4306,"['Being', '80s', 'kid', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'Superman', 'movies', 'was', 'little', 'skeptic', 'new', 'film', 'obviously', 'could', ""n't"", 'star', 'late', 'actor', 'how', 'could', 'anyone', 'else', 'Superman', 'have', 'say', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'probably', 'was', 'second', 'best', 'choice', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'influenced', 'first', '4', 'Superman', 'movies', 'either', 'when', 'wearing', 'cape', 'glasses.Unfortunately', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'who', 'believe', 'was', 'very', 'poor', 'choice', 'play', 'Lois', 'Lane', '23', 'year', 'old', 'mother', 'who', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'star', 'reporter', 'Superman', 'been', 'outer', 'space', '5', 'years', 'was', '18', 'when', 'were', 'romantically', 'involved', 'would', 'technically', 'still', 'have', 'been', 'journalism', 'school', 'then', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'other', 'hand', 'excellent', 'job', 'playing', 'Lex', 'Luther', 'was', 'relieved', 'see', 'makers', 'have', 'opted', 'keep', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'version', 'not', 'replace', 'larger', 'life', 'supervillian.As', 'story', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'sequel', '4', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'films', 'Superman', 'been', 'away', '5', 'years', 'looking', 'remains', 'home', 'planet', 'Krypton', 'time', 'Lex', 'Luther', 'been', 'released', 'jail', 'Man', 'Steel', 'neglected', 'show', 'up', 'court', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'gotten', 'romantically', 'involved', 'man', 'given', 'birth', 'son.Luther', 'once', 'again', 'found', 'way', 'Superman', 'Fortress', 'Solitude', 'stolen', 'one', 'crystals', 'order', 'wipe', 'United', 'States', 'existence', 'create', 'new', 'continent', 'can', 'sell', 'highest', 'bidder', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'fact', 'whole', 'movie', 'full', 'references', 'first', 'film', 'exact', 'same', 'opening', 'credits', 'score', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'few', 'appearances', 'grave.As', 'look', 'actors', 'dress', '1930s', 'guess', 'nice', 'journalistic', 'feel', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'employees', 'being', 'main', 'protagonists', 'movie', 'also', 'kind', 'classic', 'timeless', 'atmosphere', 'One', 'thing', 'not', 'do', 'however', 'recreate', 'magic', 'first', '2', 'Superman', 'movies', 'were', 'set', 'glitter', 'glamour', 'world', 'late', '70s', 'early', '80s', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'not', 'wear', 'shiny', 'evening', 'gowns', 'live', 'Metropolis', 'penthouse', 'very', 'young', 'house', 'wife', 'lives', 'Wayne', 'Manor', 'Granted', 'upset', 'Superman', 'having', 'left', 'five', 'years', 'even', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'there', 'simply', 'magic', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'way', 'was', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'clearly', 'visible', 'pretty', 'lame', 'flying', 'sequence', 'Remember', 'Can', 'Read', 'Mind', 'Well', 'not', 'anymore', 'guess', 'What', 'happened', 'lovely', 'night', 'time', 'shots', 'Metropolis', 'Manhattan', 'beautiful', 'wide', 'open', 'landscapes', 'American', 'West', ""'d"", 'have', 'thought', 'warlike', 'days', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'add', 'little', 'patriotism', 'Superman', 'movie', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'fight', 'truth', 'justice', 'American', 'way', 'special', 'effects', 'are', ""n't"", 'all', 'great', 'actually', 'Superman', 'Movie', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'flying', 'sequences', 'were', 'lot', 'more', 'credible', 'flashes', 'red', 'blue', 'lame', 'CGI', 'effects', 'were', 'used', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'may', 'have', 'only', 'lifted', 'helicopter', 'save', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'first', 'public', 'appearance', 'still', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'heroic', 'feel', 'when', 'threw', 'rocket', 'space', 'landed', 'plane', 'baseball', 'stadium', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'Superman', 'fans', 'out', 'there', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'Yeah', 'back', '2', 'seconds', 'took', 'intercept', 'plane', 'subsequent', 'computerized', 'hovering', 'plane', 'entrance', 'having', 'saved', 'favorite', 'journalist.One', 'good', 'aspect', 'slow', 'pace', 'sets', 'music', 'Fortress', 'Solitude', 'farm', 'where', 'Clark', 'grew', 'up', 'look', 'sound', 'exactly', 'same', 'first', '4', 'films.All', 'guess', 'could', 'say', 'actors', 'composer', 'even', 'director', 'did', 'best', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'movie', 'guess', 'still', 'decent', 'effort', 'Trouble', 'first', 'films', 'were', 'just', 'so', 'magical', 'other', 'take', 'bound', 'leave', 'feeling', 'little', 'disappointed']",N/A

Not at all.  But it is a boringone.  And that's a special kind of sin when it comes to superheromovies.That being said, it's the sheer number of duplication from the 1978 Superman movie, annoyances all, that take you `out' of the movie experience.  Here are the Grand Annoyances that make up this film...At 2 hours and 34 minutes, it is way, way too long.  To say you could cut an hour out of this movie would be generous.  With the amount of ""plot"" involved, this could easily have been a 1-hour TV show.Seriously.While it's not exactly a remake of the 1978 Christopher Reeve movie,it's about as close as you can get sometimes.  While one line is veryclose to a line in that film, two others are repeated verbatim.  LexLuthor, and his gal pal (who doesn't like him, and longs for/is sorryfor Superman) plan to kill millions of people and then make millions inreal estate.  A piece of Kryptonite from Addis Ababa plays a key role.Which film?  Both !!The young actor playing Superman?  He's not bad at all, really.  But hedoesn't play Superman; he does an impression of Christopher Reeve doingSuperman.  Don't get me wrong, he does it well.  But did we need that?Speaking of which, did we need Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane?  About asintegral as Katie Holmes or whoever it was in latest Batman movie, this'sleepwalk' role of a nothing character could have been played by anyone.  Even that Marsden guy (who sleepwalked through 3 X-Men movies, turning team leader Cyclops into a nothing character), could've played Lois Lane.  Oh, but wait.  He was busy sleepwalking through the role of Lois Lane's husband !Frank Langella, who hasn't been good since he played Dracula 30 years ago, is equally useless.Daily Planet boy scout in residence, Jimmy Olsen, however, manages todrink a beer and say ""pissed.""

Maybe it's his unknown status, maybe it's his lookalike affinity with Christopher Reeves, but he fits and plays the iconic character pretty much to the T.The other characters, not so much, but that doesn't necessarily mean they were bad.  Kevin Spacey was a brilliant Lex Luthor, but Spacey's bad misfortune is to have a very recognizable face.  He's... Kevin Spacey.  However, the baldness suited him and he really did seem to move around comfortably in Luthor's shoes, so to speak... sometimes acting very chillingly.  Kate Bosworth did a good Lois Lane, but I must say that this movie really made me dislike the character.I don't remember Kitty from anywhere, but that is one great character, especially as a foil to Luthor.  Her ditziness can get annoying, but the way it helps one underestimate her character is actually one of the better parts of the movie.  I can say that Kitty stole the show with this one, though nobody else ever mentions her.Many people told me this movie was too long before I went to see it, but it's really not.  I hardly noticed the playlength.  That, to me, is a sign of a good, well-paced movie.  I didn't really get too much into story as a whole or even the action, it was mostly the characters and especially the exploration of the very iconography that interested me.

1023671,AXV9GS0TMSVW,B000J10EQU,Poor Napoleon,"[2, 5]","Anyone who has seen the first two X-men movies was probably excited to hear Bryan Singer was directing Superman Returns.  In those movies he balanced the human (mutant?) element of the characters with a fair amount of external conflict with Magento and co.  One would think that he could take that formula over to the Man of Steel and make an equally good movie.  Not so.  The result presents Superman at his most vulnerable - which is not a bad thing - but Singer gives us a bit too much of it.Superman returns takes place after the events of Superman II.  Superman returns to earth after taking a 5 year hiatus to go visit Krypton.  What happened during those 5 years is never explained clearly in the film.  This causes it to be more than mildly frustrating when we hear that this is the reason that Lex Luthor got off the hook because Supes couldn't make his court date and that we see a confounded Lois Lane, played by a horribly miscast Kate Bosworth, who has moved on from Superman.  Throughout the film, Superman is trying patch up this relationship.  Singer spends a good amount of the movie showing that Superman is not very good at this.Oh yeah, there is some action in it.  Superman's first act of goodwill on his return involves stopping an air plane from crash landing.  Then there is a good montage of Superman going around helping people and then there is a finale with Luthor which kind of ends with a wimper.  The Luthor/Superman conflict is handled very poorly.  Though props to Kevin Spacey who has the part down really well.In defense of Singer, his biggest crime is not giving a good balance of the human/vulnerable Superman and the Superman who is the greatest superhero in the world.  Singer may have felt that viewers had enough of that and gave more attention to the humanity of Superman. That we see that side of Superman is not a bad thing.

1023672,A2J04ZS8TD8OGR,B000J10EQU,"P. Soares ""Darkknightman""","[6, 12]",Superman Returns completely betrays the character as he is portrayed in Donner's films.  This was intended as a sequel but fails to capture the spirit of the originals.  Superman the movie was essentially the story of an immigrant coming to a new land and embracing it as his new home.  He falls in love with Lois and spends much of the film swooning over her.  Superman two essentially tells the story of Superman giving up his responsibility as Earth's protector to be with Lois.  He learns that his responsibility supercedes his own personal needs.So what happens in Superman Returns?  HE LEAVES FOR FIVE YEARS WITHOUT TELLING LOIS!  Apparently he learned nothing in Superman 2.  He abandons the place he swore to protect and the ones he loves to search for remnants of Krypton.  How stupid.  He comes back and wonders why Lois is upset and has moved on without him?  He's left for five years without telling her he was leaving.  Then he spends time stalking her and even attempts to get Lois to cheat on her fiance.  How heroic.  And I suppose he is never going to tell his son who he is either.And Lex Luthor's plan is nothing more than a retread of the first film.

1023673,ACQLZ27XTNPKC,B000J10EQU,"Rain ""Araina""","[0, 11]","I went into this movie knowing that it wouldn't be as good as the original.  I knew that the actors (besides Spacey) couldn't pull off the amazing chemistry that the original cast had.  However, this terrible sloppy, disappointing, boring attempt at a film was by all standards terrible.  The plot line is underdeveloped, the impact of Superman's character slight, and Kate Bonsworth did such a horrible and dreary job of playing Lois you would swear that they picked the worst actress they could find.  I was appalled whenever I heard the original music from Superman being played in this hideous unrecognizable rip off of a genius film we grew to love.First of all, why would Lois purposely take her son to Lex's layer, where she knows danger could be?  Second, what happened to the great flood that was supposed to cover the US?  Third, who in the world would want to live on that island which was no more than a giant rocky mountain with no vegetation to support life?  Senseless faulty plotline with too many holes.  There was no chemistry between any of the characters.  I am mystified at the fact that some people actually liked this film; it was terrible in everyway!The storyline, acting, and dialog was weak in every way possible.  I could not believe my eyes as the credits rolled that this film made it to the big screen.  At the least I was expecting some good action scenes and amazing effects but there was barely even any of those.  This was the worst super hero movie since the Hulk, and honestly, I think it comes close to being even worse than that.

1023674,AZ9JWGE1UGKZA,B000J10EQU,R.A. McKenzie,"[6, 15]","A title card displays telling us that Superman came to Earth to protect the world and serve justice, but then inexplicably left us.  We are then given the famous John Williams score from 1978 and even the cool blue credits (if you've never seen them, you are missing history, people!).  And then the movie begins with a bizarre scene where Lex Luthor steals a dying widow's fortune, Luthor then returns to the Fortress of Solitude (Superman's hideout in the Arctic), and then Superman crash-lands in a spaceship to Smallville outisde of Martha Kent's home.  What in the blue hell (forgive the pun) is going on here?  Fortune-stealing, hideout invasion, an invincible hero with flying powers crashing in a spacecraft?  Such events are not the traditional ""Superman"" happenings.  The movie goes downfill from there.We learn that Superman left Earth to visit Krypton and...um, visit Krypton to...oh wait, he left Earth simply because the plot demanded some character developments that wouldn't have happened otherwise.  Okay, let me get to the bottom of this.  Lex Luthor, Superman's most notorious adversary, is trying to kill Superman basically to kill Superman.  No surprise there, however there is a logical if laughable reason that Luthor still roams the Earth freely - Superman missed his court appearance!  Lois Lane, the feisty hard-edged reporter of the Daily Planet and closest correspondent to the Man of Steel, has a son and is engaged to the editor's nephew.  Interesting idea, and a few good scenes, but what ultimately develops out of that idea is a melodramatic love triangle that goes on and on and begs for our sympathy and our tears as if we were watching ""The Notebook"" or ""Before Sunset"".  What about Superman, or his alter ego Clark Kent?  Again, why did he leave Earth for five years?  What compelled him to return?  Why was he in a spacecraft?  Clark Kent is still that charming goof who conveniently shows up when Superman does.  Do people STILL NOT see behind the glasses or notice the coincidenes?  As for Superman, he's one cool-looking hero who returns in awesome fashion, but then just does his usual thing.  More on the Man of Steel, later.The key to a great superhero film, in most cases, is a great villain.  Kevin Spacey portrays Lex Luthor as a greedy intellect who has no problem with destroying parts of the world so that his real estate value will begin and grow into a fortune.  Sound like a good idea?  It does, but it also did so back in 1978 when Lex Luthor had the same exact idea - cause destruction so that real estate empire begins.  But I really am too harsh, because in 1978 it was nuclear missiles that would do the damage, whereas in 2006 it's Kryptonian crystals from the Fortress of Solitude.  What's equally disappointing is that Luthor and Superman barely share any screen time together (I counted two very short scenes).Okay, so the character developemtns and romantic interest and villain conflict are all out.  But every superhero movie has some exciting action, right?  This ""Superman Returns"" does very well.  There is an exciting plane-crash save, some Superman errands (stop robbers, prevent civilian harm), and a bizarre land-mass removal (don't ask).  But there is very little Superman action, so the main appeal of watching most superhero movies is totally thrown out the window.Part of a superhero film is showing the splendor and imagination of using one's powers for good, or the struggle to remain selfless when using them, or the loss of will to use them at all.  There are an infinite number of themes that can be used to portray a superhero.  What ""Superman Returns"" chose to do with the Man of Steel is vaguely explain why he quit, show briefly why the world is in awe of his return, and then let him do a couple of neat tricks.  Throw in the aforementioned love triangle into the mix, plus that sweet-faced kid who carries unbelieveable secrets I dare not reveal, and we have one hell of a mess here.I've come to believe that making a good ""Superman"" movie is one tough task.  Think about it: he's an invincible hero with a weakness for radioactive pieces that only the most knowledgable villain could even have a chance of finding.  Because he has few physical weaknesses, then the only way to show depth is explore his emotional levels.  Because this movie doesn't show much heart through its characters, then we basically have a slow-paced action flick with some good-looking scenes.The first movie from 1978 was the setup for the Man of Steel.  The second film showed Superman's toughest challenge yet - three Krypton villains.  ""Lois and Clark"" addressed the romantic complications of Superman and the woman he loves most.  ""Smallville"" is showing Clark Kent's growth from a teenager into a young man, learning to embrace his identity.  All of those movies/shows are terrific!  It saddens me to say this, but maybe the character of Superman has been completely exhausted.",2,"""Superman Returns!""...What Else, Exactly?",1151539200,"06 29, 2006",2006,4946,"['title', 'card',

1023677,A31U2QT7SAL7K,B000J10EQU,"Reginald D. Garrard ""the G-man""","[4, 9]","Last summer director Christopher Nolan boldly (and wisely) chose to revamp the Batman saga with the box office smash, ""Batman Begins."" The producers of television's ""Smallville"" took ""creative license"" with the Superman legend, producing a show faithful to the mythology yet unique in its own right.Now comes, ""Superman Returns,"" which pays homage to the previous film and television adaptations, while maintaining the ""comic book daring-do"" and peril. Director Bryan Singer has a genuine respect for the character and does little to alter the viewer's preconceived notions of ""The Man of Steel.""And that's the film's biggest weakness: there's very little that is fresh and exciting about this interpretation of the myth.Of course, the special effects are state-of-the-art and one can see the producers' investments were well spent. However, the story itself is rather basic: Superman returns from a self-imposed exile, Lois has gone on with her life and had a child, Lex Luthor is still up to no good, and Superman eventually saves the world.But, even in the scene where an incapacitated Superman is roughed up by Luthor and his lackeys, one never feels that the ""man in blue"" is ever in any danger.And the fact the Lois Lane survives not one but two life-ENDING situations stretch the imagination even for a science fiction/fantasy film of this type.As far as the performances go, Brandon Routh does a reasonably good job as Kal-el/Clark Kent/Superman, even though he had some huge shoes to fill, following Christopher Reeve who put his signature on the role. The producers of ""Smallville,"" as well as Tom Welling, were wise enough to not have the Clark Kent character interpreted as did Reeve.Kate Bosworth makes a worthy ""Lois Lane"" and James Marsden is very good as Lane's suitor who must come to grips that his main competition is a guy ""faster than a speeding bullet."" Frank Langella does an adequate ""Perry White,"" while Sam Huntingdon does a good job of ""channeling"" Marc McClure from the first two Reeve's films.Oscar-winner Eva Marie Saint is appropriately sincere as ""Martha Kent""; however, ""Smallville's"" Annette O'Toole is a more dynamic interpretation and more of a contemporary version of Superman's ""mom.""Parker Posey's ""Kitty Kowalski"" is a bit too dense and doesn't compare to Valerie Perrine's ""Miss Teschmacher"" from the 70's films.Unfortunately, Kevin Spacey, though probably due to the script, makes ""Lex Luthor"" nothing more than a ""thug with money."" In both the earlier films, and both the animated and live action versions, Lex Luthor is calculating, ruthless, but possessing of an air of class about him. Michael Rosenbaum, Gene Hackman, and Clancy Brown have assayed the role, respectively, and have emboldened the character with traits the Spacey's version lacked.On another front, composer John Ottman borrowed familiar themes by John Williams for the original films. However, Ottman's ""original"" music sounds so similar to Williams's arrangements that the producers might as well have paid Williams' asking price.It is hoped that the next go-around will be a ""return"" that's a tad ""fresher.""3.5 stars, rounded off to 4",4,New film draws inevitable comparisons,1152576000,"07 11, 2006",2006,3149,"['Last', 'summer', 'director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'boldly', 'wisely', 'chose', 'revamp', 'Batman', 'saga', 'box', 'office', 'smash', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'producers', 'television', 'Smallville', 'took', 'creative', 'license', 'Superman', 'legend', 'producing', 'show', 'faithful', 'mythology', 'yet', 'unique', 'own', 'right.Now', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'homage', 'previous', 'film', 'television', 'adaptations', 'maintaining', 'comic', 'book', 'daring-do', 'peril', 'Director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'genuine', 'respect', 'character', 'little', 'alter', 'viewer', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'Man', 'Steel', 'film', 'biggest', 'weakness', 'very', 'little', 'fresh', 'exciting', 'interpretation', 'myth.Of', 'course', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'state-of-the-art', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'producers', 'investments', 'were', 'well', 'spent', 'However', 'story', 'rather', 'basic', 'Superman', 'returns', 'self-imposed', 'exile', 'Lois', 'gone', 'life', 'had', 'child', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'still', 'up', 'good', 'Superman', 'eventually', 'world.But', 'even', 'scene', 'where', 'incapacitated', 'Superman', 'roughed', 'up', 'Luthor', 'lackeys', 'one', 'never', 'man', 'blue', 'ever', 'danger.And', 'fact', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'life-ENDING', 'situations', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'even', 'science', 'fiction/fantasy', 'film', 'type.As', 'far', 'performances', 'go', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'reasonably', 'good', 'job', 'Kal-el/Clark', 'Kent/Superman', 'even', 'had', 'huge', 'shoes', 'fill', 'following', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'who', 'put', 'signature', 'role', 'producers', 'Smallville', 'as', 'well', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'were', 'wise', 'enough', 'not', 'have', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'character', 'interpreted', 'did', 'Reeve.Kate', 'Bosworth', 'worthy', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'James', 'Marsden', 'very', 'good', 'Lane', 'suitor', 'who', 'must', 'come', 'grips', 'main', 'competition', 'guy', 'faster', 'speeding', 'bullet', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'adequate', 'Perry', 'White', 'Sam', 'Huntingdon', 'good', 'job', 'channeling', 'Marc', 'McClure', 'first', 'two', 'Reeve', 'films.Oscar-winner', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'appropriately', 'sincere', 'Martha', 'Kent', 'however', 'Smallville', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'more', 'dynamic', 'interpretation', 'more', 'contemporary', 'version', 'Superman', 'mom', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'Kitty', 'Kowalski', 'bit', 'too', 'dense', ""n't"", 'compare', 'Valerie', 'Perrine', 'Miss', 'Teschmacher', '70', 'films.Unfortunately', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'probably', 'due', 'script', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'nothing', 'more', 'thug', 'money', 'earlier', 'films', 'animated', 'live', 'action', 'versions', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'calculating', 'ruthless', 'possessing', 'air', 'class', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'have', 'assayed', 'role', 'respectively', 'have', 'emboldened', 'character', 'traits', 'Spacey', 'version', 'front', 'composer', 'John', 'Ottman', 'borrowed', 'familiar', 'themes', 'John', 'Williams', 'original', 'films', 'However', 'Ottman', 'original', 'music', 'so', 'similar', 'Williams', 'arrangements', 'producers', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'paid', 'Williams', 'asking', 'price.It', 'hoped', 'next', 'go-around', 'will', 'be', 'return', 'tad', 'fresher', '3.5', 'stars', 'rounded', '4']",N/A

The humor was always prevalent, and I will always like the first 2 of that original series. Fortunately, for the movie-going public at large, the very smart, very brilliant Bryan Singer came up with a new, darker take on the series...though a very indvidual accomplishment. The 2-disc version is quite fine, with great insights on the casting, and various other elements that went into this filmmaking endeavor. Mr. Singer is ever-present in these many extras, providing humorous and fun stuff. The film, itself, is quite fine. I saw it in a theatre before I bought this set. Brandon Routh is certainly the best looking, most handsome Superman ever on film. It's unfortunate that Mr. Singer kept him brooding and serious most of the time; that smile could melt anyone. Kate Bosworth was a terrific Lois, and I  may be the first to say the Sam Huntington as Jimmy Olson was great! Indeed, he made Clark's return seem exciting and interesting. James Marsden also was fine in what must have been a difficult role. Then there's Mr. Routh, never missing a trick, always in command. The absolute best thing about this film, in my opinion, is that there's the nastiest of Lex Luthor portrayals by Kevin Spacey, truly the way it should be. The meanness was uncompromised, and it was the most powerful performance in the film. Also, I've also been a fan of Parker Posey, especially in  Christopher Guest's improvisational films. She is very fine here, too, being the foil to Spacey's maniac tirades. I also very much liked the reference to John Williams' original score, and the love theme, ""Can You Read My Mind"" (which was NOT nominated for an Oscar in '78, but is one of the most remembered themes in film).

1023689,A1TG06H9ZC0THR,B000J10EQU,Robert Gillis,"[3, 6]","Nana: My grandmother, Anne GillisIn mid 2004, acclaimed director Bryan Singer was offered the chance to direct the new Superman film. Singer jumped at the chance and signed on to direct Superman Returns for Warner Brothers.Although his influences for the character run the gamut, Singer has a special love for the first Superman movie, starring Christopher Reeve and directed by Richard Donner (STM). Singer even asked for and received Donner's blessing before signing on.May I say that Bryan Singer has created a masterpiece.I don't want to give anything away, so let me say that Brandon Routh IS Superman. Kate Bosworth IS Lois Lane. And Kevin Spacey's Lex Luthor is pure evil and perfect. The rest of the cast - Frank Langella as Perry white, Sam Huntington and Jimmy Olsen, James Marsden as Richard White, and Eva Marie Saint as Ma Kent - they're all perfect. And five year old Tristan Lake Leabu as the little boy who may or may not be Superman's son - is adorable but never annoying.Since April 2005 I have been following the production of this movie almost daily. I didn't want to get my hopes too high; Superman has disappointed me before.But I could not have asked for better. I never expected the film to be this big, this good. There was NOTHING I didn't like and dozens of scenes that impressed the hell out of me. I LOVED IT. I will see this film many times - something I haven't done for a film for many years.Some reviews of this film have commented that the best scenes have already been shown in the 20 TV spots or three trailers. This isn't true. While many terrific scenes have been shown (and you have to LOVE the bullet bouncing off Superman's eyeball shot), you simply can't get an accurate understanding of the movie from minutes of clips. Even if you've read the novel, even if you seen the movie guides, you don't know this film.There are twists and turns, there are nuances, subtleties, and subtext. The actors bring these characters to vivid life and make us care about the story. The sets and ""look"" of the film transport us easily to Metropolis, Smallville, the ruins of Krypton, and to many other places.Visually, the production design of the film is very impressive. While the Donner film was clearly set in 1978, this film has more of timeless feel, due to the deco style throughout, particularly in the Daily Planet sets, which appear to be a pleasing combination of modern technology with Art Deco facades. This blending of old and new gives the film a timeless feeling. There are deco fixtures next to plasma screens. And everything looks lived in, not shiny like it was just created. And the details, the details, the details... from the framed newspapers on the walls to the unusual facade at the entrance, everything on this set are in the details.The special effects are simply phenomenal. Finally, we have the technology to show Superman as he was meant to be seen. Many of the shots in this film use advances in movie making magic and computer technology undreamed of just a few years ago. The CGI and other effects are organic to the film, never intrusive, but simply spectacular.I don't have an adequate superlative to describe the flying sequences. Special effect technology has come so far, even in these last few years. These days, it's not ""You'll believe a man can fly,"" because everyone flies around in movies these days -- even Keanu Reeves flew in the Matrix films (and did so realistically; I remember seeing ""Matrix: Reloaded"" and musing that if a new Superman film were ever made, I hoped that the flying would be that good). These days, the question is, ""Is the flying believable? Does the flying seem organic to the story or does it look like a special effect? The flying throughout the film is incredible and believable.The surprises - some telegraphed, some out of nowhere, are brilliant. The look of the picture is stunning. And of course, there's always that wonderful feeling of a summer film - spending two hours in a theater with popcorn and soda, being taken away to another world and enjoying the ride.Fans will probably be divided over whether the film is too derivative or not derivative enough of other Superman movies/shows, but I think one particular decision will be embraced by all -- the film is dedicated to the memory of Dana and Christopher Reeve.Acknowledging my lifelong love of the character, I have never been obsessed to the point where I will accept anything. Some interpretations of Superman have been tolerable (the third movie, some of the cartoons), some have been unforgivable (the 1974 musical, the fourth movie) and some have produced outrage and confusion (the comics, ""Birthright."") So I say with no hyperbole whatsoever that the movie is perfect. It was completely worth the wait. I absolutely could not have asked for more. I never expected it to be this good, this perfect.I loved the story. I loved the nods to the comics and the movies that were everywhere, the cameos, making this universe both new and familiar. I loved that the characters are handled with reverence and respect that the story is meaningful, and the action is intense. The performances are dead on, they are brilliant. The casting is perfect. The film has heart.Thank you, Bryan Singer. Thank you, Brandon Routh. Thank you to everyone who made this movie a reality.Superman Returns. Better than ever. The legend intact.

1023691,A2TYJ5W3TLWK96,B000J10EQU,Robert S. Moyer,"[6, 9]","Bryan Singer + iconic superhero = money in the bank?  Not quite.Pacing: Richard Donner's 1978 Superman movie had three distinct sections, each with its own pacing.  Donner took us from the cold technology of Krypton, to the wide-open sky and fields of Kansas, to the claustrophobic hustle bustle of Metropolis.  With a couple of short exceptions, Singer's movie had the same, ponderous pacing and claustrophobic feel throughout.  And speaking of claustrophobic, if any movie has too many close-ups, this is it.Script:  In an interview, the screenwriters said that they made a point to make Superman a citizen of the world, not just the US.  They even went so far as to delete the line ""...and the American Way"" from Superman's slogan (which was there since the 50's).  So through news clips they show Superman saving people falling off buildings the world over.  To think he would have the time or awareness to be Johnny-on-the-spot all over the world stretches the credibility of even a super-hero movie.  And to believe that he could have been the same character if he was raised anywhere other than the heartland of America is ridiculous.  If you don't understand or respect Superman's ""fly-over states"" roots, you shouldn't be writing his script.Acting: Kevin Spacey was stuck on ""smug"", Brandon Routh is bland as both Superman and Clark Kent, and Kate Bosworth portrayed Lois Lane like a cub reporter, not a Pulizer Prize winner. Hurray for Parker Posey who actually did something fun with the material.Atmosphere:  The environments do not feel fleshed out.  Judging by this movie, three people live in Kansas (and one of them is an alien), Metropolis doesn't have police/news copters or Coast Guard support, and there is no sense of urgency at the Daily Planet.  Deadlines?  What deadlines?  It all felt superficial.  These weren't living, breathing environments, these were cardboard set pieces for Superman to fly around and through.Add it together and you get a missed opportunity.  There are some nice touches here and there but not enough to give it more than three stars.

In that era, the Internet still was confined to government agencies, cell phones were extremely bulky contraptions only for the `super' wealthy alone, and the Cold War still existed.This screenplay attempted a tremendous feat of going back in time to an era, essentially before the last two movies were even made.Unfortunately doing this made Clark Kent into a very inept `nerd'. Because he is now effectively established in pop culture as `good looking' in his own right, Singer really should not have tampered with `Clark Kent'----instead leaving him as Dean Cain and Tom Welling  effectively reconfigured this part of the legend in public consciousness.Since Brandon Routh is a pretty decent looking guy himself, better `Clark' character development easily could have highlighted his own sex appeal throughout this entire film ultimately without alienating audiences. Even the earlier Christopher Reeves and George Reeves interpretations wanted their audiences to come away liking `Clark' as much as 'Superman'; Clark isn't supposed to be the buffoon leaving viewers wondering how he even got the Daily Planet's attention. .Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) having a kid is admittedly off cannon, but I've seen deeper goofs on television. It's an interesting proposition though: can Clark now be a parent to the same kid that he briefly fathered while a non-kryptonian but then never met until just now? Because he gets presented as the 'good guy' this technical revelation of Superman/Clark Kent as 'the absentee father' is a novel plot twist!Less convincing is Lois's relationship with Perry White's nephew, I've never ever heard of him until now! Plus, the idea that she would just happen to fall in love with the boss's relative is too coincidental for my tastes. Not to mention Lois herself--who does not either look or act like the big city investigative reporter whom I attempted to emulate with some success in a college newsroom!Singer obviously took advantage of the advanced special effects capabilities and set designs since the 1980's, so having 'Clark' and other characters walk around in (what I presume is an attempt at) 'classic' wear just makes them look like they are obvious actors on an obvious movie set. I understand that both this screenplay's writer and director wanted to pay tribute to Christopher Reeve and his time in the title role, but they also needed to have decided what era they were setting this movie in, and then STICK WITH IT!There is a reason why Routh looks much better--not to mention more comfortable--decked out in the 'Superman' outfit as opposed to his 'Clark' clothes. If he himself appears so uncomfortable in the latter character, why should audiences ourselves be comfortable with that role--who ultimately is the real person while Superman is the powers according to this script?Sure, there are highlights in this film--Kevin Spacey plays a delicious 'Lex Luthor' and  archive footage of  Marlon Brando as 'Jor-El' reminds audiences of the additional reasons why the first 'Superman' movies WERE awesome blockbusters.  However, this particular screenplay itself is obviously a case of not having completely thought through how to implement a `great idea'. Thinking projects completely through is always essential to ensuring they are a `super' success.",2,`Superman' doesn't leap over its own self-constructed tall buildings,1151625600,"06 30, 2006",2006,3546,"['Batman', 'revived', 'success', 'ongoing', 'small-screen', 'success', 'Smallville', 'producers', 'movie', 'must', 'have', 'thought', 'now', 'was', 'opportune', 'time', 'revive', 'Superman', 'movie', 'franchise.The', 'last', 'Superman', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1980', 'era', 'Internet', 'still', 'was', 'confined', 'government', 'agencies', 'cell', 'phones', 'were', 'extremely', 'bulky', 'contraptions', 'only', 'super', 'wealthy', 'alone', 'Cold', 'War', 'still', 'screenplay', 'attempted', 'tremendous', 'feat', 'going', 'back', 'time', 'era', 'essentially', 'last', 'two', 'movies', 'were', 'even', 'made.Unfortunately', 'doing', 'made', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'very', 'inept', 'nerd', 'now', 'effectively', 'established', 'pop', 'culture', 'good', 'looking', 'own', 'right', 'Singer', 'really', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'tampered', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'instead', 'leaving', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'effectively', 'reconfigured', 'part', 'legend', 'public', 'consciousness.Since', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'pretty', 'decent', 'looking', 'guy', 'better', 'Clark', 'character', 'development', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'highlighted', 'own', 'sex', 'appeal', 'entire', 'film', 'ultimately', 'alienating', 'audiences', 'Even', 'earlier', 'Christopher', 'Reeves', 'George', 'Reeves', 'interpretations', 'wanted', 'audiences', 'come', 'away', 'liking', 'Clark', 'as', 'much', ""'Superman"", 'Clark', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'buffoon', 'leaving', 'viewers', 'wondering', 'how', 'even', 'got', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'attention', '.Lois', 'Lane', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'having', 'kid', 'admittedly', 'cannon', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'deeper', 'goofs', 'television', 'interesting', 'proposition', 'can', 'Clark', 'now', 'be', 'parent', 'same', 'kid', 'fathered', 'non-kryptonian', 'then', 'never', 'met', 'just', 'now', 'presented', ""'good"", 'guy', 'technical', 'revelation', 'Superman/Clark', 'Kent', ""'the"", 'absentee', 'father', 'novel', 'plot', 'twist', 'Less', 'convincing', 'Lois', 'relationship', 'Perry', 'White', 'nephew', ""'ve"", 'never', 'ever', 'heard', 'now', 'idea', 'would', 'just', 'happen', 'fall', 'love', 'boss', 'relative', 'too', 'coincidental', 'tastes', 'Not', 'mention', 'Lois', 'who', 'not', 'either', 'look', 'act', 'big', 'city', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'whom', 'attempted', 'emulate', 'success', 'college', 'newsroom', 'Singer', 'obviously', 'took', 'advantage', 'advanced', 'special', 'effects', 'capabilities', 'set', 'designs', '1980', 'so', 'having', ""'Clark"", 'other', 'characters', 'walk', 'what', 'presume', 'attempt', 'wear', 'just', 'look', 'are', 'obvious', 'actors', 'obvious', 'movie', 'set', 'understand', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'director', 'wanted', 'pay', 'tribute', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'time', 'title', 'role', 'also', 'needed', 'have', 'decided', 'what', 'era', 'were', 'setting', 'movie', 'then', 'STICK', 'WITH', 'IT', 'reason', 'why', 'Routh', 'much', 'better', 'not', 'mention', 'more', 'comfortable', 'decked', 'out', ""'Superman"", 'outfit', 'opposed', ""'Clark"", 'clothes', 'so', 'uncomfortable', 'latter', 'character', 'why', 'should', 'audiences', 'be', 'comfortable', 'role', 'who', 'ultimately', 'real', 'person', 'Superman', 'powers', 'according', 'script', 'Sure', 'are', 'highlights', 'film', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'delicious', 'Luthor', 'archive', 'footage', 'Marlon', 'Brando', ""'Jor-El"", 'reminds', 'audiences', 'additional', 'reasons', 'why', 'first', ""'Superman"", 'movies', 'WERE', 'awesome', 'blockbusters', 'However', 'particular', 'screenplay', 'obviously', 'case', 'not', 'having', 'completely', 'thought', 'how', 'implement', 'great', 'idea', 'Thinking', 'projects', 'completely', 'always', 'essential', 'ensuring', 'are', 'super', 'success']",N/A

1023696,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000J10EQU,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 1]","***1/2There seems to be a feeling afoot that The Man of Steel may just possibly have outlived his usefulness - that after a 19-year-long hiatus from the big screen, Superman might be a tad too much of a straight-arrow boy scout to compete with all those morally confused, angst-ridden comic book heroes that have come our way in the past several years.  This is certainly the criticism I've heard most frequently leveled against ""Superman Returns"" - that the movie simply isn't sophisticated enough to have any relevance in our cynical, post-modern 21st Century age - but, frankly, I find the movie's simplicity, straightforwardness and actual LACK of sophistication to be rather refreshing for a change.  Not all comic book heroes need to be deeply conflicted to be interesting.  Some times it's nice just to believe in a super human savior who's ready to swoop down from the skies and rescue us from a fate-worse-than-death at a moment's notice, no questions asked.  Who's really going to be fussing about the do-gooder's moral and psychological ambiguity at a time like that anyway?As ""Superman Returns"" begins, we learn that the Man of Steel has been absent from the earth for five years, having gone back to his original planet, Krypton, after some astronomers located its whereabouts.  Having found little there but a desolate cinder, Superman returns to earth to re-kindle his love interest with Lois Lane and to resume his fight for truth, justice and...well, you fill in the rest for yourself, the filmmakers having cagily opted to de-emphasize the character's nationalism in an effort to boost the film's revenue potential overseas.As stated previously, ""Superman Returns"" is a relatively straightforward tale of good versus evil done in broad strokes with only a minimum of psychological shading.  Superman may have problems in the romance department, but he seems otherwise well adjusted to his role of the world`s sole functioning superhero.  Crippling self-analysis has really never been Superman's ""thing"" anyway so there wouldn't be much point in his suddenly becoming unduly brooding and introspective here.  Luckily, the film makes up in warmth and charm what it lacks in sophistication.  Director Bryan Singer wisely chooses to emphasize the romance over the storyline which is little more than the usual generic silliness about Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) inventing a machine that will allow him to take over the world (ho hum).  The real conflict comes with Superman discovering that Lois has moved on to a new love interest and has a five-year-old son.  Superman's attempts to woo her back provide some of the most lyrical, touching moments of the film.  In fact, Singer, who has directed the film with both energy and style, is at his best in the subtler moments when he's showing us Superman flying across the city and around the world, backed by some of John Williams' most subtle musical passages since ""E.T.""  The Lex Luthor stuff, with all its attendant, high-tech special effects and eye-popping action sequences, just feels like the icing on the multi-million dollar cake.""Superman Returns"" is far from a perfect film.  It runs way too long at 155 minutes and we still can't understand why nobody is able to put two and two together and figure out that Clark Kent and Superman are really one and the same person - especially when they both disappear for five years, then make a surprise return to town at exactly the same moment.  Oh well, some things one just has to accept on faith when it comes to movies of this type, I suppose, and this is clearly one of them.  Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth lack the spunk and charisma that Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder brought to the roles, but they have a chemistry that works well on screen anyway.At least ""Superman Returns"" has a bit of a heart and soul to it, which is more than can be said for other recent blockbusters like the ""Mission Impossible"" or ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies.  And even though I appreciate a layered, psychologically conflicted comic book figure as much as the next guy, it's nice to have the real thing back for a change as well.",3,a welcome return to simplicity,1172966400,"03 4, 2007",2007,4141,"['***1/2There', 'be', 'feeling', 'afoot', 'Man', 'Steel', 'may', 'just', 'possibly', 'have', 'outlived', 'usefulness', '19-year-long', 'hiatus', 'big', 'screen', 'Superman', 'might', 'be', 'tad', 'too', 'much', 'straight-arrow', 'boy', 'scout', 'compete', 'morally', 'confused', 'angst-ridden', 'comic', 'book', 'heroes', 'have', 'come', 'way', 'past', 'several', 'years', 'certainly', 'criticism', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'most', 'frequently', 'leveled', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'movie', 'simply', ""n't"", 'sophisticated', 'enough', 'have', 'relevance', 'cynical', 'post-modern', '21st', 'Century', 'age', 'frankly', 'find', 'movie', 'simplicity', 'straightforwardness', 'actual', 'LACK', 'sophistication', 'be', 'rather', 'refreshing', 'change', 'Not', 'comic', 'book', 'heroes', 'need', 'be', 'deeply', 'conflicted', 'be', 'interesting', 'times', 'nice', 'just', 'believe', 'super', 'human', 'savior', 'who', 'ready', 'swoop', 'down', 'skies', 'rescue', 'fate-worse-than-death', 'moment', 'notice', 'questions', 'asked', 'Who', 'really', 'going', 'be', 'fussing', 'do-gooder', 'moral', 'psychological', 'ambiguity', 'time', 'anyway', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'learn', 'Man', 'Steel', 'been', 'absent', 'earth', 'five', 'years', 'having', 'gone', 'back', 'original', 'planet', 'Krypton', 'astronomers', 'located', 'whereabouts', 'Having', 'found', 'little', 'there', 'desolate', 'cinder', 'Superman', 'earth', 're-kindle', 'love', 'interest', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'resume', 'fight', 'truth', 'justice', 'well', 'fill', 'rest', 'filmmakers', 'having', 'cagily', 'opted', 'de-emphasize', 'character', 'nationalism', 'effort', 'boost', 'film', 'revenue', 'potential', 'overseas.As', 'stated', 'previously', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'relatively', 'straightforward', 'tale', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'done', 'broad', 'strokes', 'only', 'minimum', 'psychological', 'shading', 'Superman', 'may', 'have', 'problems', 'romance', 'department', 'otherwise', 'well', 'adjusted', 'role', 'world', 's', 'sole', 'functioning', 'superhero', 'Crippling', 'self-analysis', 'really', 'never', 'been', 'Superman', 'thing', 'anyway', 'there', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'point', 'suddenly', 'becoming', 'unduly', 'brooding', 'introspective', 'here', 'Luckily', 'film', 'up', 'warmth', 'charm', 'what', 'sophistication', 'Director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'wisely', 'emphasize', 'romance', 'storyline', 'little', 'more', 'usual', 'generic', 'silliness', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'inventing', 'machine', 'will', 'allow', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'ho', 'hum', 'real', 'conflict', 'Superman', 'discovering', 'Lois', 'moved', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'five-year-old', 'son', 'Superman', 'attempts', 'woo', 'back', 'provide', 'most', 'lyrical', 'touching', 'moments', 'film', 'fact', 'Singer', 'who', 'directed', 'film', 'energy', 'style', 'best', 'subtler', 'moments', 'when', 'showing', 'Superman', 'flying', 'city', 'world', 'backed', 'John', 'Williams', 'most', 'subtle', 'musical', 'passages', 'E.T', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'stuff', 'attendant', 'high-tech', 'special', 'effects', 'eye-popping', 'action', 'sequences', 'just', 'feels', 'icing', 'multi-million', 'dollar', 'cake', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'far', 'perfect', 'film', 'way', 'too', 'long', '155', 'minutes', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'nobody', 'able', 'put', 'two', 'two', 'together', 'figure', 'out', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Superman', 'are', 'really', 'one', 'same', 'person', 'especially', 'when', 'disappear', 'five', 'years', 'then', 'make', 'surprise', 'return', 'town', 'exactly', 'same', 'moment', 'Oh', 'well', 'things', 'one', 'just', 'accept', 'faith', 'when', 'movies', 'type', 'suppose', 'clearly', 'one', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'lack', 'spunk', 'charisma', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'brought', 'roles', 'have', 'chemistry', 'well', 'screen', 'anyway.At', 'least', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'bit', 'heart', 'soul', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'other', 'recent', 'blockbusters', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'movies', 'even', 'appreciate', 'layered', 'psychologically', 'conflicted', 'comic', 'book', 'figure', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'guy', 'nice', 'have', 'real', 'thing', 'back', 'change', 'as', 'well']",N/A

You see a few hints in the movie.It's interesting to see how three people handle a present and past relationship. I was rather pleased to see Lois apparently sticking with her fiance. It was also good to see Lois & her fiance take an active part in helping to save Superman from near certain death.That was another good aspect of this movie. We get to see the power of Superman, along with his vulnerability. Indeed, he almost dies at least twice.I liked the choice of Kevin Spacey for Luthor..

1023706,A1BOG5B6Z1H8ZZ,B000J10EQU,"Russell T. Burlingame ""Comics Journalist""","[5, 7]","I was not a huge fan of Spider-Man or its sequel. Well, those films are looking like cinematic gems in hindsight....As a longtime Superman reader (like many people my age, I started in 1992 with the rumors of his ""death"" and carried on reading through Doomsday!, Funeral For a Friend, The Reign of the Supermen and a dozen other half-baked stories (remember when his skin turned blue and he had electric powers? When he split in half into ""Superman Red and Superman Blue?"" When Jimmy was attacked by a vampire and saved by a stage magician? I do!). But NONE of them included a......well, these Amazon reviews have to be spoiler-free. Let's just say there's a ""plot device"" created about an hour and a half into this picture, that completely ruins the remaining hour for me. The first chunk of the film was fun, and reusing the imagery and music from the old films really captured the majesty that a Superman movie should have...but by the end, I was waiting for a Yellow Cosmic Fear Bug to pop out of the background someplace and complete the ridiculous picture.(For you non-comic people out there, the Yellow Cosmic Fear Bug is a reference to a particularly preposterous plot device used by current Superman and Action Comics co-plotter Geoff Johns to explain away the ten-year period during which Green Lantern became a maniacal and exceptionally powerful villain named Parallax. Turns out that yellow being the color of fear ISN'T totally random, but instead has some kind of historical basis in this cosmic, insectoid monster called The Parallax. It took the guy over--it completely wasn't his fault when he lost it and killed all his friends and supporting cast members!)Back to Superman--the first half or so of the film was terrific. It was cinematically a wonder--so many of the shots were terrific, the performances were pitch-perfect (except the irritating guy who played Jimmy Olsen--played him WAY geekier than needed). The DP on this film should get a medal. Same for the music folks, who made the important and emotionally-impactful decision to stick almost exclusively to the original John Williams score from 1978's Superman: The Movie or at least to pieces that evoked that score.But the focus on Superman as Savior (there's even a shot of him literally looking like he's being crucified) doesn't work at all in light of certain moral ambiguities introduced to Kal-El's character in this film--while Jor-El (Marlon Brando, from beyond the grave) extols the virtues of being a shining beacon, and an example by which mankind might grow better, his son has done some seriously questionable things leading up to this film, not the least of which is the very premise of the movie--that he left one day, never told anyone why, and never had a satisfactory answer throughout the picture for why he might have done it. The closest anyone comes is when Clark offers that maybe Superman had never said goodbye to Lois ""because it would have been too painful for him."" This seems to be not to be a particularly worthy savior. Singer's example to all humanity cops out on one of the most important things he may ever do--saying a potentially final goodbye to the one person he loves more than anything--because he's worried about what? Crying a little bit? Running off to Krypton and staying there for years because he wanted to seems like an extraordinarily self-centered move, and this is reinforced when, immediately on his return to Earth, he watches a news report full of terrible things that it's implied he could have stopped, had he stayed.A profound disappointment, this one.

I enjoyed this movie when I realized this was a new Superman and a new take on Superman. It's kind of the same mentality with ""Batman"" -vs- ""Batman Begins"" Same characters, but a whole different movie and a different concept. You can't put them together and expect to be satisfied.With Superman Returns, you can't put it into the lineup of the original Superman films of the '80's. Instead, this new Superman deserves a whole new fan base purely based on its own merit as a truly enjoyable film. They did a good job on this movie, and it shouldn't be marred by the expectations of us old Superman fans.Superman Returns really evokes emotion out of you and I found that the characters were a bit more true to who they really are. Lex Luther was played very well by Kevin Spacey, and I found that I didn't love and laugh at Lex Luther, which is the way it should be. He's a villain, you can't like the villain (i.e.- I always found Gene Hackmans Lex Luther to be hilarious and funny) Superman Returns has a very real dark element to it, it seems more realistic. Superman himself was played very well and instead of being a campy ""Can Do!"" superhero, he came across to us as a real guy, and I liked that. Lois Lane as played by Kate Bosworth is pretty ho-hum, as I think they could've done a better job on the casting. A 98 pound 22 year old isn't a very convincing choice for the part of the strong minded and strong person that Lois Lane is supposed to be.Otherwise, it's a great film, but take it for what it is and enjoy it as a whole new Superman film rather than a sequel in a series.",5,Take it for what it is and enjoy!,1164326400,"11 24, 2006",2006,1729,"['was', 'very', 'hesitant', 'see', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'was', 'raised', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'Superman', 'was', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'when', 'realized', 'was', 'new', 'Superman', 'new', 'take', 'Superman', 'kind', 'same', 'mentality', 'Batman', '-vs-', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Same', 'characters', 'whole', 'different', 'movie', 'different', 'concept', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'together', 'expect', 'be', 'satisfied.With', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'lineup', 'original', 'Superman', 'films', ""'80"", 'Instead', 'new', 'Superman', 'whole', 'new', 'fan', 'base', 'purely', 'based', 'own', 'merit', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'marred', 'expectations', 'old', 'Superman', 'fans.Superman', 'Returns', 'really', 'emotion', 'found', 'characters', 'were', 'bit', 'more', 'true', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'Lex', 'Luther', 'was', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'found', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'laugh', 'Lex', 'Luther', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'villain', 'ca', ""n't"", 'like', 'villain', 'i.e.-', 'always', 'found', 'Gene', 'Hackmans', 'Lex', 'Luther', 'be', 'hilarious', 'funny', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'very', 'real', 'dark', 'element', 'more', 'realistic', 'Superman', 'was', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'instead', 'being', 'campy', 'Can', 'Do', 'superhero', 'came', 'real', 'guy', 'liked', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'played', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'pretty', 'ho-hum', 'think', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'better', 'job', 'casting', '98', 'pound', '22', 'year', 'old', ""n't"", 'very', 'convincing', 'choice', 'part', 'strong', 'minded', 'strong', 'person', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'supposed', 'be.Otherwise', 'great', 'film', 'take', 'what', 'enjoy', 'whole', 'new', 'Superman', 'film', 'rather', 'sequel', 'series']",N/A

1023713,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000J10EQU,Samuel McKewon,"[3, 8]","Roaring, triumphant, stirring visual poetry - this is ""Superman Returns,"" a stunning piece of pop art celebrating a comic book superhero as more than a psychological headcase - although there's some of that in Bryan Singer's film - but as an icon that bridges the gap between, yes, Earth and the universe - the mystery that surrounds its vastness and God. Yes, it's underwritten - loose ends dangle about. And it's not very funny. And it's not ""action-packed."" And aside from Kevin Spacey's work as Lex Luthor, the performances are more about the look of the actor than the acting itself.But so were many of Stanley Kubrick's later films, when the director communicated a narrative beyond the script, marrying film, sound, music and editing into mesmerizing sequences that simply held you, alert and aware of the scene's resonance and singularity - it was like so much, and yet nothing like those things. It's exuberant and risky to compare Singer to that standard - his ""X-Men"" pictures were competent, nothing more - but the last hour of this film reaches for that titanic light and grasps it with a somber, beautiful tone that seeks to comment on nothing less than the fate of our souls.Using same credit titles from the original ""Superman"" and ""Superman II,"" ""Superman Returns"" begins with the destruction of the planet Krypton, which Superman (Brandon Routh) despite knowing its fate, seeks out anyway, leaving Earth for five years to find it ""a graveyard"" and returning to more or less resume duties - and a relationship with Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth). But Lois has moved on to a decent boyfriend (James Marsden, again the other man) and a son (Tristan Lake Leabu), of whom, it is now known, is the son of Superman.The early acts of the screenplay by Dan Harris and Michael Dougherty concern themselves more with Luthor's plan to reconfigure Earth with Krypton crystals, which he finds can create new (if pretty uninhabitable) landmasses for his control. Spacey has reworked Luthor as a soulless, humorless but convincing demon who picks at the flaws of Superman while erecting a hell on Earth over which he can reign. His moll, Kitty (Parker Posey) is a mouthy dim bulb and his collected henchmen are, thankfully, more fearsome than idiotic. One experiment with the crystals causes an accident aboard an Airbus jet that Lois is on, and Superman's ""return"" is to save it and, in the process see Lois again.Routh is no Olivier, or even Christopher Reeve, but then Singer's doesn't require it; in fact, needs Routh to be just what he is. Superman is upright and quiet, burdened by human psychosis but not racked with it himself, content to let his deeds and warmth speak on their own. He makes an effort to woo to Lois away from her boyfriend, but it is not a fierce one. Bosworth makes a cute, likable Lois, smart and insecure, a trembler who marches forth anyway, and is drawn to Superman's certitude. She won a Pulitzer for writing an editorial about ""Why The World Doesn't Need Superman,"" which of course is a substitute for a father, or God, or absolute authority. Superman really stands in as an angel sent by father Jor-El (Marlon Brando, in voiceovers from the original ""Superman"") to save ""a good people, who wish to do well."" An angel who complicates his existence by loving one of them.And we are them. Through Lois, and her boyfriend, Singer charts our relationship with the myth. Through Luthor, he presents an eloquent, brutal argument - just look what ""goodness"" Superman's home material will bring us. ""God is a selfish being who share his powers,"" he says, prior to harnessing some of that power. Superman's rebuttal is a straight shot beyond Earth, to lend an ear to all the aggrieved who cry out, or to draw radiance from a blazing sun above the clouds. Singer presents these uncomplicated, pristine, wonderfully framed scenes at the right moments, capturing, in a blink, the relationship of a blessed son with his father, that son with the world, the son with himself. Better, at this stage in our cinematic capabilities, that the film doesn't bog itself down in the lengthy discourse required to explain Superman's pose to the world. More pointed and visually impacting to simply show it. Recalling ""Batman Begins,"" the most memorable shot is that of Christian Bale, perched on a skyscraper at dusk, a sentry over the city. ""Superman Returns"" is full of that wonder, culminating in an extraordinary sequence that finds the Man of Steel saving the planet and falling back to it at an incalculable speed, rustling the trees of their mist upon his landing.Singer and cinematographer Thomas Newton Sigel wisely forge these visuals with a darker palette borne out of the deep blues and pitch blacks of outer space. The final act of ""Superman Returns"" is set against an ocean storm and gray, monolithic structure that recalls the undersea Manhattan of Steven Spielberg's ""Artificial Intelligence."" Otherwise, Metropolis glistens, and the Daily Planet seems to exist in a perpetual golden dust, Singer borrowing Kubrick's technique to airbrush the light into a furry haze, especially around Bosworth. The production and costume design is classic, snazzy and retro. The movie resonates with the mood of an earlier, innocent era, despite the stakes at hand. The look is warm and rapturous.It cuts a path that will stupefy some moviegoers, who will find it dry, save Spacey's performance as Luthor. A hardening of the culture, and a lack of intangible curiosity, will bring them to their boredom, so accustomed they've become to the overliterate and brainy scripts of recent superhero movies. ""Superman Returns"" has a deep subtext - spiritual, in fact - but it's a visual one; the screenplay is enough of a foundation to support the images, but Singer does not endeavor to mire his picture down in a pop culture sludge that makes it tastier.The result is action cinema of high order. It can be chilling - a piano duet between the boy and one of Luthor's henchmen. Or tragic - a severe beating of Superman on the krypton island. Or, in the climax, extraordinary. But so many of the scenes have the whisper of deep care behind them, of exquisite construction, of the hush of a late evening across the world. ""Superman Returns"" is a mournful, moody, wonderful thing. Its calm is rousing, and its universal perspective wise. Some myth all right.",5,"Echoes of Kubrick.

1023716,A26WVK274IA7DN,B000J10EQU,Sarah Bellum,"[4, 7]","Do people want a savior? Do we deserve one? Or, should we resign ourselves to the fact that things happen for a reason and we should accept them as our fates? As he hovers in the atmosphere with his arms out, so as to form a cross, Superman says he believes we want a savior because he constantly hears people pleading for one. (In this sense, his Superhearing permits him to be omniscient) The film seems to conflate ""redeemer"" with ""rescuer."" Whereas a redeemer would save one's soul from an eternity of damnation, a rescuer would merely remove one from harm's way; these are hardly comparable. Having written that, however, I do appreciate the effort the filmmakers have put forth to bring a deeper, more meaningful aspect to the Superman mythos (even if it IS a distinctly Christian one). Jor-El, Superman's father, says he has sent his only son (Kal-El) to earth in an effort to affect positive change, clearly mirroring the way the Christian Bible indicates God sent his son, Jesus Christ. What to make of Lois Lane, along with her son and her man, rescuing Superman from almost certain death after he is stabbed with Kryptonite and plunges into deep water? It certainly deflates his importance and makes him more vulnerable. It is hardly coincidental that Jesus of Nazarene was also stabbed in the side and left for dead. Having someone or something in which to believe can make a positive difference for an individual because it provides hope when we need it most. Not many people actually believe Superman exists, no matter how good the special effects are. Logic does not permit it. For many people, however, Jesus Christ is very much a real person. Yet, no matter how much logic does not permit it, people still believe in Christ the Redeemer: believe in this person and ye shall have life ever after in the Kingdom of Heaven. Are the makers of ""Superman Returns"" trivializing the Christian religion, or overemphasizing the importance of the Superman character? I suppose the box office intake is one barometer for the legitimacy of this comparison. (Would it be fair to compare the two, given the vastly different age demographics? Considering the age of the average moviegoer, Superman would win every time.) Much like the Bible, both ""Superman Returns"" and the Superman legend make for nice stories, but what we glean from them is what is important. Are we going to rely on someone else for our happiness and, ultimately, our eternity? Or, will we wisely seek to shape our own fates, without reward in mind? The point is that people do indeed look for a savior because we all need help at one point or another. The irony is that each of us can be a hero, a savior or at least someone to help when needed. All it takes is being able to recognize the signals and the willingness to help. Does the world need Superman? Yes, it needs supermen (and women) to become involved and make a difference in our everyday lives. Holding truth and justice as ideal values is half the battle; we need only work for these daily in order to achieve them. Messianic parables aside, I find Brandon Routh to be a little too young to be believable as either Clark Kent or as Superman. He certainly has the body for it and he looks and sounds very similar to Christopher Reeve, yet he seems more boyish than mannish. Perhaps next time around he'll get more lines of dialogue to flesh out the character. The remainder of the cast is terrific, especially Kevin Spacey as Lex Luther.

Brandon Routh did a great job as Superman and Clark Kent, and I was able to buy Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane, but Kevin Spacey was a little too over the top as Lex Luthor.  He came off too much as a ""bumbling genius"" and the film never really portrayed him as much of a real threat.  In fact, the entire Lex Luthor plot could have been removed from the film entirely and it would not have made too much of a difference.This film is mainly about Superman's five year absence from Earth and his relationship with Lois Lane and her son.  There are a lot of scenes of Superman defeating various crimes and people cheering, all of which has been done before in the previous films.  The only new take on this we have are better special effects.  Now I know you have to show this in a Superman movie, but there was nothing that jumped out at me to give me that inner excitement and say to myself ""wow, awesome!.""While not a bad movie, ""Superman Returns"" just doesn't live up to the hype of 10 years of production and a huge budget.  There are too many plot holes, too much camp (Lois Lane's son kissing superman on the forehead when he's sick...), and not enough of a villain.  This movie really could have done better if Bryan Singer had demonstrated more weakness in Superman.  Where's the suspense if Superman is never really shown in danger?Ultimately, most general audiences will enjoy this film and I am glad I saw it, but I don't have any interest in sitting through it again or owning it on DVD.

1023723,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B000J10EQU,Sean Pasek,"[7, 12]","There is a reason that the 1978 version of Superman is a classic.  It stands against the test of time.  Christopher Reeve definitely made you think that he could fly.  Subtle body movements were more than enough to make you feel Superman in flight.  He also captured both Clark Kent and Superman, giving each of them defining characteristics that made you like and care about them, even though they were, technically, the same person.  Back in 1983, they tried to re-make Casablanca.  It isn't hard to understand why it failed.  When a movie is deemed a classic, it's virtually impossible to make it again.  Like a work of art, it can't be duplicated.And that was the first and biggest mistake of the writers and filmmakers on Superman Returns.  They simply should have made a Superman of their own rather than try to copy and extend the storyline from the original films made over 20 years ago.  Christopher Nolan understood this when he decided to finally make a good Batman film (Batman Begins).The writers probably thought they were paying tribute to the 1978 classic when they borrowed similar plot lines and even used the same dialogue in several places in this film.  You'll recognize many lines and parallel plots to easily make the connections between the '78 version and this film.In the 1978 version, Lex tries to sink part of California to increase the value of the desert land he bought.  In this version, he attempts to create his own land, using stolen Kryptonite technology and wiping out the eastern half of the United States.  You can't help but say, ""haven't we already seen something like this before?""To be fair to Brandon Routh, you simply can't fill the shoes of Christopher Reeve.  However, Routh makes Superman much too wooden.  He doesn't give much indication of anything.  He lacks the charisma that's needed to play both Superman and Clark Kent.  His facial expressions are nearly void of emotion or feeling.  Christopher Reeve was a Juliard trained actor.  He literally immersed himself in his roles, including Superman.  Routh also doesn't disguise his voice as Clark Kent.  And no one can make the connection?!?  Reeve gave Kent the charm of a bumbling Cary Grant reminicent of the Grant's film ""Bringing Up Baby.""  Supposedly, Superman Returns is a continuation from the original Superman films.  If so, why does Clark Kent no longer disguise his voice?  Also, you just don't get the sensation that he's flying.  Part of the problem with this is that there aren't enough close-up scenes of him when he's flying.  The writers and director also never devoted enough time to the characters of Clark and Superman to where we feel a connection with them.Kate Bosworth is simply awful as Lois Lane.  In fact, I don't think anyone has portrayed her worse.  Bosworth seems almost lost in how to portray the ""tough"" reporter of Lois Lane.  Even Margot Kidder furnished Lois with a ""go get'em"" attitude.  Bosworth plays Lois like a wallflower.  Plus, there is no chemistry between Routh and Bosworth which is the pinnacle of this story!  The love connection has always been about Superman and Lois Lane.  Again, they attempted to copy the romantic Superman/Lois flight as Superman takes Lois for quick ride into the night.  It doesn't work.Kevin Spacey has his moments as Lex Luthor when he's almost good as Lex Luthor.  He attempted to stick with Gene Hackman's performance.  The scene with him beating on Superman when he's being affected by kryptonite is good.  Lex is supposed to have a savage side to him.SPOILER ALERT BELOW!The back story is also not convincing enough.  Superman travels back to Krypton to find out if it is, in fact, destroyed?!?  After Jor-el tells him during his training that Krypton is gone, it's hard to believe that he would need confirmation, even if astronomers claimed to have seen it.  If Superman remembered Einstein, as Jor-el taught him about Einstein's theories of relativity in the '78 version, Superman would have realized that light from ""Krypton"" would only now be seen from Earth, and therefore, Krypton is not really there anymore.Also, the part with Superman having a son just doesn't fit at all.  When and where was this to have supposedly happen?  Again, if this is supposed to be a continuation of the original Superman films, the only time ""Superman"" slept with Lois Lane was in Superman II, and even then he was mortal.  Plus, the timing doesn't figure into it.  The writers tried to sell this ""bit"" but instead of trying to make it somewhat credible, it ends up being ludicrous.The kryptonite is also handled poorly.  Superman's powers are literally drained from him, making him even weaker than a normal person.  If you recall in the 1978 version, he couldn't even take the chain off from around his neck when Lex put the kryptonite on him.  And suddenly, in this film, with a fragment of kryptonite stuck in him, he's able to lift a land mass the size of a small country out of the ocean and into space?!?  It isn't likely or believeable, nor are we given a plausible explanation about how he could do this. Even in ""Smallville"" when Clark is exposed to kryptonite, he can barely move.Many of these problems could have been fixed simply by making a new and different Superman, rather than continuing where the previous films left off.  It would have been that simple.  I mean, they did manage to give Superman a totally different costume (the worst Superman costume ever designed).The special effects were first-rate, but this day and age, special effects aren't enough anymore.  We want a good story with good, believeable characters, and this film simply doesn't have either one.",2,Re-hash of Similar Plot Simply Doesn't Fly,1170460800,"02 3, 2007",2007,5656,"['reason',

1023725,A2IKDJBPGCY19V,B000J10EQU,seraphcelene,"[3, 6]","No offense to Brian Singer because I really did enjoy the X-Men movies, but I still don't understand who decided that re-making Superman was a good idea. Even more obvious in my head then Micheal Keaton is Batman, Christopher Reeve *is* Superman. It took the phenomenal talent of Christian Bale to shift the idea of who The Batman could be and make me believe it. How could any less be expected of the next actor to fill Reeve's blue tights.What Christopher Reeve did was to create two separate and individual characters who just happened to be played by the same actor, and although we occasionally see them merge together for a moment or two, brief reminders that Clark Kent is Superman in disguise, it's that dedication to playing them as total polar opposites that makes Reeve's Superman iconic.Unfortunately, as hot as he is, all Brandon Routh did was to remind me that he isn't Christopher Reeve. He looked the part well enough and mimicked Reeve's performance close enough that I didn't throw popcorn at the screen, but there was nothing that made me think, oh, yes, he is Superman. I was entertained, but mostly I just thought of how much better Christopher Reeve was in the part.Kate Bosworth never even came close to Margot Kidder's Lois Lane, but then I never expected her to and so there was no real disappointment. It looked like they tried to age Bosworth into the part, which only made her look like a teenager playing dress-up. I didn't believe her as a mother for one minute, but doesn't necessarily require age to make believable. Acting chops, however, would have helped.The rest of the cast was mostly negligible. I didn't care for the attempt at externalizing the love triangle between Kent, Lois and Superman by introducing James Marsden as Lois's capable, hunky Superman-esque fiance. He was, I think, meant to represent a melding of the two characters and I found that extraneous. Because of the type of film it was, I wasn't expecting Lois to leave her fianc&eacute; for the Man of Steel and without at least the hint of that possibility, we loose a lot of narrative tension.Gene Hackman continues to reign supreme as Lex Luthor. Kevin Spacey did nothing to convince me of otherwise. I did, however, adore Parker Posey as Luthor's Pomeranian carrying girlfriend, Kitty. I was initially reminded of Miss Tesmacher in the original Superman, but that didn't last for long. Parker's ditzy, emaciated brunette was just screwball enough to make me forget (or forgive) her similarities to Miss Tesmacher.Overall, I was surprised that I didn't hate Superman Returns, that I was just entertained enough to watch it til the end and was even invested in him recovering, like we knew he would, from the Kryptonite poisoning (How he managed to lift that giant coral reef of Kryptonite and hurl it into space, I will never understand, especially considering how it was COVERED with Kryptonite AND he had Kryptonite fragments still in his body -- but oh well, handwave, as they say).Maybe if there hadn't been so many successful re-inventions of the Superman mythology then I would have been more satisfied with the movie. I don't, for example, ever compare Smallville with the Superman movie franchise, or Tom Welling with Christopher Reeve. In my mind they are two different things. Same goes for differences between the films and the cartoons (Animated Series and Justice League). I can only lay blame at the feet of a movie that invoked a superior film without successfully reimagining it into something new and fresh.",3,How many f's in catastrophe?,1222214400,"09 24, 2008",2008,3532,"['offense', 'Brian', 'Singer', 'really', 'did', 'enjoy', 'X-Men', 'movies', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'who', 'decided', 're-making', 'Superman', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'Even', 'more', 'obvious', 'head', 'then', 'Micheal', 'Keaton', 'Batman', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', '*is*', 'Superman', 'took', 'phenomenal', 'talent', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'shift', 'idea', 'who', 'Batman', 'could', 'be', 'make', 'believe', 'How', 'could', 'less', 'be', 'expected', 'next', 'actor', 'fill', 'Reeve', 'blue', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'did', 'was', 'create', 'two', 'separate', 'individual', 'characters', 'who', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'played', 'same', 'actor', 'occasionally', 'see', 'merge', 'together', 'moment', 'two', 'brief', 'reminders', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Superman', 'disguise', 'dedication', 'playing', 'total', 'polar', 'opposites', 'Reeve', 'Superman', 'iconic.Unfortunately', 'as', 'hot', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'did', 'was', 'remind', ""n't"", 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'looked', 'part', 'well', 'enough', 'mimicked', 'Reeve', 'performance', 'close', 'did', ""n't"", 'throw', 'popcorn', 'screen', 'was', 'nothing', 'made', 'think', 'oh', 'yes', 'Superman', 'was', 'entertained', 'mostly', 'just', 'thought', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'was', 'part.Kate', 'Bosworth', 'never', 'even', 'came', 'close', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'then', 'never', 'expected', 'so', 'was', 'real', 'disappointment', 'looked', 'tried', 'age', 'Bosworth', 'part', 'only', 'made', 'look', 'teenager', 'playing', 'dress-up', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'mother', 'one', 'minute', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'require', 'age', 'make', 'believable', 'Acting', 'chops', 'however', 'would', 'have', 'helped.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'mostly', 'negligible', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'attempt', 'externalizing', 'love', 'triangle', 'Kent', 'Lois', 'Superman', 'introducing', 'James', 'Marsden', 'Lois', 'capable', 'hunky', 'Superman-esque', 'fiance', 'was', 'think', 'meant', 'represent', 'melding', 'two', 'characters', 'found', 'extraneous', 'type', 'film', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'Lois', 'leave', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Man', 'Steel', 'least', 'hint', 'possibility', 'loose', 'lot', 'narrative', 'tension.Gene', 'Hackman', 'reign', 'supreme', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'did', 'nothing', 'convince', 'otherwise', 'did', 'however', 'adore', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'Luthor', 'Pomeranian', 'carrying', 'girlfriend', 'Kitty', 'was', 'initially', 'reminded', 'Miss', 'Tesmacher', 'original', 'Superman', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'Parker', 'ditzy', 'emaciated', 'brunette', 'was', 'just', 'screwball', 'enough', 'make', 'forget', 'forgive', 'similarities', 'Miss', 'Tesmacher.Overall', 'was', 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'was', 'just', 'entertained', 'enough', 'watch', 'til', 'end', 'was', 'even', 'invested', 'recovering', 'knew', 'would', 'Kryptonite', 'poisoning', 'How', 'managed', 'lift', 'giant', 'coral', 'reef', 'Kryptonite', 'hurl', 'space', 'will', 'never', 'understand', 'especially', 'considering', 'how', 'was', 'COVERED', 'Kryptonite', 'had', 'Kryptonite', 'fragments', 'still', 'body', 'oh', 'well', 'handwave', 'say', '.Maybe', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'so', 'many', 'successful', 're-inventions', 'Superman', 'mythology', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'satisfied', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'example', 'ever', 'compare', 'Smallville', 'Superman', 'movie', 'franchise', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'mind', 'are', 'two', 'different', 'things', 'Same', 'differences', 'films', 'cartoons', 'Animated', 'Series', 'Justice', 'League', 'can', 'only', 'lay', 'blame', 'feet', 'movie', 'invoked', 'superior', 'film', 'successfully', 'reimagining', 'something', 'new', 'fresh']",N/A
1023726,ANEDXRFDZDL18,B000J10EQU,Serene Night,"[3, 6]","I was worried about Superman Returns when after 20 minutes it failed to excite me. Then after Superman decides to rescue Lois on the plane things really become hot. The new actor who plays superman really has both Clark/Superman down. He really managed to portray the angst and sadness of the alien being which is superman without being a self-pitying sad sack.Lois was another matter. At first, I found the new actress for Lois a little annoying. She was fairly plain and her hair was always flying everywhere. It was difficult for me to believe she was a star reporter. She just didn't have any 'presence' or 'poise' when giving her interviews. I am glad she was less abrasive than her predecessors, but would've liked to see her look a bit more believable. She looked like an extra from Charmed, rather than poised confidant reporter. Perhaps this could be fixed with a better wardrobe, stylist, etc. Oddly enough though, the actress grew on me. While I don't think I could ever see the comic book Lois as a ""Mommy"" I ended up liking this Lois more than the previous one. Go figure.Jason was adorable, and I'm not a big fan of little kids in movies. They kept his lines to a minimum and he was perfect.Lois new beau was great. I'm a HUGE fan of Marsden, so I was pleased to see the actor introduced as the 'third' corner of the love triangle. I was glad he had a larger role, and that the character was not minimized to make Supes look good. He shown particularly in the plane scenes and the scene on the boat towards the end.The only downside of this film, I think was Lex. He was just too goofy. His sidekicks weren't serious. I'd like to have seen a more diabolical and calculating Lex, rather than the cartoon ""I'm so evil"" villain we were treated to. I guess I liked the Lex from Smallville so much, its hard to go back to the over-the-top version. Perhaps Lex was done this way to add some comic relief, but it seemed a bit flat considering the serious undertones to the film.There were a few false notes. I didn't care for the humor involving the Pomeranians...And Lois rebounding in the plane and walking around afterward was a little too much.5 Stars. A compelling, intriguing film.

But Superman didn't need to return with this film. Before you buy or rent this film, you must know it is one of the weakest comic book based film I have seen. It is not as bad as Fantastic Four, and it doesn't even come close, but it does not give superman justice.Superman fans were excited when they heard the director's name: Bryan Singer, the one who spawned the first two X-Men films. This film bombed based on expectations. With a budget of around $215,000,000, it only grossed $200,000,000. It lacked the $15,000,000, which dropped the budget for the follow-up to $175,000,000. You might ask, why did it kind of bomb?The storyline is spectacular. Superman returns after five years to see Lois Lane with a child and engaged, writing articles for The Daily Planet, bashing Superman. It also involves Lex Luthor trying to take over the world once again, only this time he is trying to wipe out the United States to make a new continent. The film starts off very slow, and the first seven minutes is just credits alone. Then it becomes cliched in superhero films. The film only has three major action scenes: the plane crash, the bank robery/car antics, and the world taker over, the last thirty some odd minutes of the film.The film is gorgeous, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't have the heart that Superman has. Brandon Routh is an excellent Superman, yet Kate Bosworth is a heartless, boring Lois Lane. Kevin Spacey is a fun, just fun, Lex Luthor, but he is not that evil. Parker Posey plays Lex Luthor's femal sidekick, adding humor that was actually funny.The film is promising during the action sequences, but it becomes boring when Superman and Lois Lane are having their ""Why did you leave"" romantic moments. THe only shocking thing about Superman Returns's plot is (SPOILER WARNING---SKIP THE REST OF THE PARAGRAPH IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO FIND OUT!!!) Superman has a son, Lois Lane's son, which it is obvious from the second time you meet the child.I thought Superman Returns was going to be a fun superhero adventure, like Spider-Man 2, yet it falls short to be a mediocre cry for a return of Superman. The film didn't have the heart it needed to succeed. It is gorgeous, and if it were a film about nothing, it would deserve an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture, but it is a film about Superman, a boring film at that.",2,Superman Didn't Need to Return with This Film,1165017600,"12 2, 2006",2006,2442,"['Superman', 'one', 'best', 'superheroes', 'time', 'So', 'most', 'fans', 'were', 'awaiting', 'return', 'right', 'Yes', 'Superman', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'return', 'film', 'buy', 'rent', 'film', 'must', 'know', 'one', 'weakest', 'comic', 'book', 'based', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'Fantastic', 'Four', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'not', 'give', 'superman', 'justice.Superman', 'fans', 'were', 'excited', 'when', 'heard', 'director', 'name', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'one', 'who', 'spawned', 'first', 'two', 'X-Men', 'films', 'film', 'bombed', 'based', 'expectations', 'budget', '215,000,000', 'only', 'grossed', '200,000,000', 'lacked', '15,000,000', 'dropped', 'budget', 'follow-up', '175,000,000', 'might', 'ask', 'why', 'did', 'kind', 'bomb', 'storyline', 'spectacular', 'Superman', 'five', 'years', 'see', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'child', 'engaged', 'writing', 'articles', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'bashing', 'Superman', 'also', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'trying', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'once', 'again', 'only', 'time', 'trying', 'wipe', 'out', 'United', 'States', 'make', 'new', 'continent', 'film', 'off', 'very', 'slow', 'first', 'seven', 'minutes', 'just', 'credits', 'alone', 'Then', 'cliched', 'superhero', 'films', 'film', 'only', 'three', 'major', 'action', 'scenes', 'plane', 'crash', 'bank', 'robery/car', 'antics', 'world', 'taker', 'last', 'thirty', 'odd', 'minutes', 'film.The', 'film', 'gorgeous', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""n't"", 'have', 'heart', 'Superman', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'excellent', 'Superman', 'yet', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'heartless', 'boring', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'fun', 'just', 'fun', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'not', 'evil', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'femal', 'sidekick', 'adding', 'humor', 'was', 'actually', 'funny.The', 'film', 'promising', 'action', 'sequences', 'boring', 'when', 'Superman', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'are', 'having', 'Why', 'did', 'leave', 'romantic', 'moments', 'THe', 'only', 'shocking', 'thing', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'plot', 'SPOILER', 'WARNING', '-SKIP', 'REST', 'THE', 'PARAGRAPH', 'IF', 'YOU', 'DO', 'NOT', 'WANT', 'TO', 'FIND', 'OUT', 'Superman', 'son', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'son', 'obvious', 'second', 'time', 'meet', 'child.I', 'thought', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'fun', 'superhero', 'adventure', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'short', 'be', 'mediocre', 'cry', 'return', 'Superman', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'heart', 'needed', 'succeed', 'gorgeous', 'were', 'film', 'nothing', 'would', 'deserve', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Picture', 'film', 'Superman', 'boring', 'film']",N/A

No,not Underdog The Movie,but the LONG awaited return of the Man of Steel,Superman!Bryan Singer has created in Superman Returns a masterpiece thatfans and moviegoers won't forget anytime soon.Taking place afterSuperman II,Superman Returns gets the series back on track and makes us remember why we love the Man of Steel in the first place.Here is my review of this wonderful film.(includes minor spoilers)Scientists have found the remains of the remains of Krypton,soKal-El,aka Clark Kent/Superman(Brandon Routh),makes a journey tothe remnats in the Kryptonian spaceship he arrived in from thefirst film.He is disappointed that what he finds nothing of anyvital significance and flies back to Earth.When he returns,theworld has changed:five years have passed and the world has learned to move on without Superman.The girl he loves,Lois Lane(Kate Bosworth),is now a mother,is engaged to be married to theeditor of the Daily Planet's nephew(James Marsden,""The X-Men Trilogy),and has written a award-winning article called ""Why theworld doesn't need Superman.""After visiting his mother(Eva Marie Saint in a wonderful performance),Clark returns to Metropolis in order to get his job back at the Daily Planet.Nobody knew he was gone,except Jimmy Olsen(Sam Huntington,who gives the film's best performance),who is overjoyed to see his friend return.While the two are taking a lunch break,Lois is on a plane where she is taking part in aspace shuttle launch when all the technology fails.Clark watchesthis on the television and knows it's time to return as Superman.After stopping the plane(the film's most amazing scene),Lois is reunited with the man she loves and is reunion of mixed emotions.Meanwhile,the technology has failed because of a certain bald villian.That's right,Lex Luthor(Kevin Spacey)has been released from prison and is launching another scheme asonly Lex can.Now,Superman,who is slowly winning back the respect of the people of the world,including Lois,must stop Lex before Lex achieves world domination.To sum it up,this is the most fun,you will have at the movies this year!The acting is wonderful.Kevin Spacey chews up the screen as Lex Luthor.He is like Gene Hackman in the sense that he is funny,but he is also very driven in this movie to destroy Superman and to fulfill his plan of world domination.Parker Posey is Kitty,his female accomplice and she has several good moments in the film.James Marsden is also very good as Lois finace,Richard.Eva Marie Saint is not in the film very much,neither is Frank Langella as Perry White,but are both very good.No need to worry about Sam Huntington as Jimmy;he is the best actor in the movie.And now the two leads:Kate Bosworth is a very good Lois.Not only is she really attractive(sorry,had to put that down),but also acts like Lois would today.She is very good in this role and I hope she continues the role in the next couple of movies.And finally,Brandon Routh.Brandon Routh is a very good Superman and I think he is an absolutley wonderful Clark Kent.He picks the mannerisms of Christopher Reeve(Rest in Peace),but he adds something to the roles,especially as Superman.He WILL win over fans and I hope to see him in this film's sequel.Other positive aspects of the film are the action pieces,the visual effects,and the score.The action is the best there has ever been in a Superman film.Superman stopping the plane,saving the city,and all the other action scenes are wonderful as well.The visual effects are great.Superman finally flies the way he always should have.You will be very impressed as he see not only Superman using his flying abilities,but also his heat vision,super breath,and his many other abilites as well.The score is great as well.Wisely using the classic John Williams score,the film also uses new music from John Ottman(X2:X-Men United)and it goes very well with the original score.Two thumbs up with the above mentioned.As good as the film was,it's not perfect.It does have faults,but they are minor.The first problem was at first some of the scenes felt out of order near the beginning of the movie.However,it was important to the plot and once I thought about it,the movie began to flow much better.Second,Brandon Routh,Kate Bosworth,and Kevin Spacey are great,but Christopher,Margot Kidder,and Gene Hackman are the ones I grew up with,so it felt weird seeing these great actors in these roles.But they are so great that they eventually win you over with their performances.And third and finally,the movie is similar to the first film,but to me,this is a much better movie than the first because the characters are better and the plots  for Lex's plan and the Superman/Lois Lane scenes are far better here as well.So overall,Bryan Singer has created another comic book movie masterpiece that will join with Batman Begins,the Spider-Man Movies,the X-men Movies,the first two Supermans,the Blade movies,Batman:Mask of the Phantasm,and the Crow as one of the best comic book movies ever made.Bryan Singer truly made a film for the fans and you can tell he is a fan himself just from watching the opening credits.You will love this film.I am a even bigger Superman fan now after seeing this film and hopefully everyone else who sees the film will feel the same way.Superman is back!

He proved that with the first two X-Men films.  He definitely does NOT disappoint with his Superman debut.  Singer wanted an ""unknown"" to play the lead, in much the same way Reeves was chosen years ago to play the caped crusader.  Brandon Routh is perfect.  He is respectable to what we, the audience, expect from Superman, a bit of a tribute to Reeves in his looks and demeanor, but he also applies something new to the role as if we are seeing Superman for the first time ever.The special effect scenes are not too over the top, so this doesn't become an action-packed thriller that leaves you stunned but bored.  The first real big scene involving the airplane will have you hooked. The story line is solid and it is what it is, picking up right where the last Superman movie left off practically.  Clark comes back and is trying to gel back into the scene at the paper.  Lane has a kid and a steady boyfriend.  And boom...Superman is back to save the country from Lex, played by Kevin Spacey.  There is nothing ""too new"" about the story, except for the actors themselves, so SM fanatics can definitely appreciate it.  Clips of Marlon Brando as SM's father are even used as a tribute to the early films.With as many over-the-top, action packed, cheap thrills, bad acting, and poor story lines for movies that are cluttering up the big screens these days, Superman Returns definitely saves the day for us moviegoers.  You have to appreciate this film for its new edge on the comicbook take, but also for the good old true fashion values it brings to the overall theme of Superman the character that we've come to appreciate throughout the years.Christopher Reeves would be proud!

1023732,A1FCWRSICTO2AH,B000J10EQU,S. Harris,"[3, 5]","Superman Returns is a strange movie to watch.  Gone is the square jawed linebacker sized hero.  Instead, newcomer Brandon Routh gives you a Superman that is more like Michelangelo's David: an almost sylph-like figure, that floats beautifully above us all, watching, protecting.  In doing so, the movie conveys, intentional or not, a great loneliness and vulnerability in the Man of Steel, but also, always, the sense of Duty.  Essentially, I liked Routh's version of the great hero.  But the rest of the casting is not very good.  Spacey and Langella, two really fine actors, are miscast.  They never seem to capture the elusive ""whatever"" that director Bryan Singer was able to capture with Routh.  Spacey is viscious at Lex Luthor, but he has no style.  Luthor has to have style, but Spacey gives us a villain that is just a dead eyed figure belonging to another genre: noir. Langella seems like he's on medication, and not the hyper editor we should expect.  Only Parker Posey, as Luthor's associate and babe Kitty, seems to remember that this is a story based upon a comic book.  Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane is also miscast.  There were times I felt most of the supporting actors were sleepwalking through their roles. The story itself is somewhat incoherent, but I chalk that up to the film being something of an intended re-introduction (and grab bag) to the characters and elements of the Superman story.  However, despite all of these missteps, weirdly, the film works.  I guess, perhaps, because we all want a Superman up there, watching, protecting us all. And Superman Returns does remember that One Essential part of the story, and returns to it, smartly, again and again.",3,Mystic Superman,1165104000,"12 3, 2006",2006,1683,"['Superman', 'Returns', 'strange', 'movie', 'watch', 'Gone', 'square', 'jawed', 'linebacker', 'sized', 'hero', 'Instead', 'newcomer', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'Superman', 'more', 'Michelangelo', 'David', 'almost', 'sylph-like', 'figure', 'floats', 'beautifully', 'watching', 'protecting', 'doing', 'so', 'movie', 'conveys', 'intentional', 'not', 'great', 'loneliness', 'vulnerability', 'Man', 'Steel', 'also', 'always', 'sense', 'Duty', 'Essentially', 'liked', 'Routh', 'version', 'great', 'hero', 'rest', 'casting', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'Spacey', 'Langella', 'two', 'really', 'fine', 'actors', 'are', 'miscast', 'never', 'seem', 'capture', 'elusive', 'director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'was', 'able', 'capture', 'Routh', 'Spacey', 'viscious', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'style', 'Luthor', 'have', 'style', 'Spacey', 'villain', 'just', 'dead', 'eyed', 'figure', 'belonging', 'genre', 'noir', 'Langella', 'medication', 'not', 'hyper', 'editor', 'should', 'expect', 'Only', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'Luthor', 'associate', 'babe', 'Kitty', 'remember', 'story', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'also', 'miscast', 'were', 'times', 'felt', 'most', 'supporting', 'actors', 'were', 'sleepwalking', 'roles', 'story', 'somewhat', 'incoherent', 'chalk', 'film', 'being', 'something', 'intended', 're-introduction', 'grab', 'bag', 'characters', 'elements', 'Superman', 'story', 'However', 'missteps', 'weirdly', 'film', 'guess', 'perhaps', 'want', 'Superman', 'there', 'watching', 'protecting', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'remember', 'One', 'Essential', 'part', 'story', 'returns', 'smartly', 'again', 'again']",N/A

Clearly it was a shoddy movie, but to a kid you just can't buy that kind of palpable movie madness.Now I'm as old as my parents were when they saw the very first Superman, and I've got to say this must be what it felt like. I think Bryan Singer is fast becoming one of the most respectable directors in Hollywood, and what he did with this movie--on a far, far grander scale than either of his X-Men movies--merits SOME kind of award come Oscar time.We all know the story--Kryptonian boy comes to Earth, saves man from the foibles of archnemesis Lex Luthor, woos Lois Lane. Singer and Co. decided to have this movie pick up after Superman II (wise move) but you never really get a jarring sense of chronology--no General Zod references here. Instead, Supe has just returned from a nearly five-year journey to see if anything remains of his homeworld; alas, the answer is no.What's strange is that him being gone is such a small deal when it comes to the overall movie. But that's okay; there's plenty more fantastic things to keep the average moviegoer and Superman afficionado happy. What I love most about this sequel is that so much of it feels like home--Brandon Routh has moments where he looks exactly like the dearly departed Christopher Reeve, and his voice is dead-on most of the time. He quotes several lines from the first movie to great effect. Kate Bosworth as Lois isn't as quirky as Margot Kidder but she still can't spell, and she does the best job I've seen in a long time of playing the ""strong female"" role without ever drawing your attention to it.The plot also feels familiar--Superman spends a night righting wrongs across the world; Luthor AGAIN gets hold of that Adis Ababa kryptonite, and Supe AGAIN falls prey to it; but there are intriguing elements dealing with Fortress crystals that take Luthor into land-grabbing madness like we've never seen.The special effects are superb, of course; you can't spend almost $300 million and get it wrong! Here is where I thought Singer might overdo things, but his restraint is commendable. He allows Routh to do all the old Superman things and yet they don't feel aged at all. Singer was concerned with how to entertain a generation where flying is no longer the spectacle it once was, and yet, watching the movie, it's hard to believe that any kid, no matter how jaded, could scoff at what's on screen. The movie is that well done.Don't let detractors fool you.

All that stuff? All that stuff? What kind of anti-American person wrote this movie? Look, if you hate America that's your business, but don't corrupt Superman!Second, Superman has an out-of-wedlock child with Lois Lane! Then when he finds out about this child, he doesn't even *attempt* to talk her into making things right by getting married. What sort of morals are you trying to teach our young people in this country with this horrific example of making babies with no thought of marriage? Technically, Superman and Lois Lane never actually did the big nasty because of time travel. Did the director even watch the previous movies?Supposedly, Superman went on a five year trip to the destroyed planet Krypton, just because he ""had to see it."" Had to see it? Who goes on a five year trip solo just to see something that isn't there anymore? Been to Mount Saint Helens lately? What did he eat? Drink? Did he share this miraculous new interspace travel with the rest of the world so they could explore the galaxy? Oh, he was too busy sightseeing to consider that.There are just too many holes and inconsistencies with the story here, and Superman, greatest of all heroes and role models, has been corrupted.

The special effects are great (which is expected) and the storyline invokes a sense of empathy to the main character. This makes the portrayal of superman more ""human"" with feelings and emotions that are common to the rest of humanity.The acting of Brandon Routh as Superman is great but not outstanding. Nevertheless, the casting of this actor as Superman is most appropriate. It makes the audience feel that they are being transported back in time to 1978 when the first Superman movie came out and Reeves was the lead actor at that time. I most definitely felt a sense of nostalgia when I compared this movie to the first two movies of the last century.The casting of Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor was also an excellent choice. He portrays the character forcefully and his performance certainly elevates this film to a higher level.However, I must add that the performance of Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane is much to be desired for. Her portrayal seems a bit rigid and I have always felt that something was missing in her character. But her acting was not too bad.In conclusion, if you are a fan of Superman, this is a must see movie. This movie, with its outstanding special effects certainly brings the whole superman franchise to a new level.

1023739,A1VABWDOUQLULZ,B000J10EQU,S. K. Harrell,"[2, 3]","I didn't go into this film with any expectations, and ultimately I thought it carried the torch fairly well, in spirit.  There was enough overlap from the original film to fill in the storyline without clinging unnecessarily to its coattails.  Whether the story progression in this film would align with the comic universe itself...  I have my doubts.  If you are a stickler for the die hard comic characters, this film will not live up to your expectations.I did not find Brandon Routh to be a particularly stand out talent. I've never seen him in anything else.  He seemed to be moving along the plot without making any real contribution.  Spacey and Parker were quite the caricatures of their roles, all but stealing the film for their villainous depictions. Even with them, though, I felt like they were doing the best they could with a weak script.  Bosworth played a fairly subdued Lane, but in the end she came across more one-dimensional to me than just hyper focused on her work ethic while trying to hide a fiery passion for blue tights.  In fact,  she came off flat out cold in her interactions with her son, the enigma of which is deciphering who his real father is. With that interjection of doubt shadowing the little one you would think that with all this overwhelming love we are supposed to believe that she feels, that she would show a little more compassion to her son.  The majority of the characters were so bland that in the end I found myself not really caring if some of the principals didn't make it.  In fact, it would have been more in keeping with the canon storyline if...  well.  You just have to see it.The plot moved somewhat slowly in the middle, with quite a few leaps in logic (or flat out misinterpretations of the original Superman mythos) conveying it through its shallow and open climax.  There were no particularly dazzling special effects but the CGI maintained the comic vividness rather well.  Honestly I spent most of this film working out contradictions in my mind regarding collective consciousness, archetypes and which came first--the broken planet or the displaced hero, but I wouldn't expect those to convey well in a film review.  =)",3,Green bad,1199923200,"01 10, 2008",2008,2184,"['did', ""n't"", 'go', 'film', 'expectations', 'ultimately', 'thought', 'carried', 'torch', 'fairly', 'well', 'spirit', 'was', 'enough', 'overlap', 'original', 'film', 'fill', 'storyline', 'clinging', 'unnecessarily', 'coattails', 'story', 'progression', 'film', 'would', 'align', 'comic', 'universe', 'have', 'doubts', 'are', 'stickler', 'die', 'hard', 'comic', 'characters', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'expectations.I', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'be', 'particularly', 'stand', 'out', 'talent', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'else', 'seemed', 'be', 'moving', 'plot', 'making', 'real', 'contribution', 'Spacey', 'Parker', 'were', 'quite', 'caricatures', 'roles', 'stealing', 'film', 'villainous', 'depictions', 'Even', 'felt', 'were', 'doing', 'best', 'could', 'weak', 'script', 'Bosworth', 'played', 'fairly', 'subdued', 'Lane', 'end', 'came', 'more', 'one-dimensional', 'just', 'hyper', 'focused', 'work', 'ethic', 'trying', 'hide', 'fiery', 'passion', 'blue', 'tights', 'fact', 'came', 'off', 'flat', 'out', 'cold', 'interactions', 'son', 'enigma', 'deciphering', 'who', 'real', 'father', 'interjection', 'doubt', 'shadowing', 'little', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'overwhelming', 'love', 'are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'would', 'show', 'little', 'more', 'compassion', 'son', 'majority', 'characters', 'were', 'so', 'bland', 'end', 'found', 'not', 'really', 'caring', 'principals', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'fact', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'keeping', 'canon', 'storyline', 'well', 'just', 'have', 'see', 'it.The', 'plot', 'moved', 'somewhat', 'slowly', 'middle', 'few', 'leaps', 'logic', 'flat', 'out', 'misinterpretations', 'original', 'Superman', 'mythos', 'conveying', 'shallow', 'open', 'climax', 'were', 'particularly', 'dazzling', 'special', 'effects', 'CGI', 'maintained', 'comic', 'vividness', 'rather', 'well', 'Honestly', 'spent', 'most', 'film', 'working', 'out', 'contradictions', 'mind', 'regarding', 'collective', 'consciousness', 'archetypes', 'came', 'first', 'broken', 'planet', 'displaced', 'hero', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'convey', 'well', 'film', 'review', '=']",N/A

Singer lead Marvel's X Men and X2...ummm...marvelously. So turning the helm over to Singer for DC Comic's Superman Returns was a big buzz.Perhaps Singer has been watching too much Smallville? Don't get me wrong, I think that Smallville is excellent. However, with Superman Returns my expectations were not set for a slow moving love story between Superman and Lois Lane...which is what 50% of the movie is; I would expect that kind of filler from Clark and Lana in the TV series Smallville...lot's of episodes to fill.Plus based on how action-oriented Singer's two X Men entries were, I had very high expectations for Superman Returns. The action was indeed good in Superman Returns, but it was predictable. There were no surprises. The special effects were good; the flying looked better than any Superman movie ever. But nothing that made me say out loud, ""Oh, cooool"" or ""That is awesome!""And the story really fell flat. In fact, it was almost a re-do of Lex Luthor's quest for real estate in Superman 1. I've seen much better stories in the Justice League animated series than Superman Returns. Much better.Some of the situations in Superman Returns were very far fetched, i.e. (without revealing any spoiling details): Superman crashing via meteor back to earth with no public fanfare; Richard White rescuing Lois in a sea plane; Luthor Waltzing right into the Fortress of Solitude. I'd have liked to have seen more realistic scenarios like the excellent job David Goyer and Chris Nolan did with Batman Begins...just...more realistic.So perhaps Singer should have stuck with X Men 3 and let someone else have Superman Returns...but that is not the way the cookie crumbled. In fact, Singer has signed on for Superman: The Man of Steel scheduled for release in 2009.Brandon Routh was a pretty good Superman preserving the Christopher Reeve portrayal almost mirror image. Kevin Spacey was a good Lex. And Kate Bosworth was a bit young looking for Lois.After saying all this, I didn't think it was a bad movie. It just fell far short of what I expected.

(RE: X-Men 1 & 2) Really, this is the most serious Superman film to date. The thing, I think, and the reason that this was not a totally huge hit, and that WB is rebooting the franchise, is that this did not capture the hopeful, uplifting rush that we generally expect from Superman. The story and the visual look are both kind of muted and thoughtful, which is not a bad thing taken alone, but it is a little short on the ""primary colors"" that put stars in your eyes and a smile on your face.I would like to have seen more from Brandon Routh, certainly more dialogue. I don't have a problem with him. However, both he and Kate Bosworth seem young for the roles when you consider this film as a ""sequel"" to the first two Christopher Reeve films. Kevin Spacey is a good actor, yes, but I just don't see him as Lex Luthor. Also, the plot is very similar to Superman I.I think that Superman Returns coulda/shoulda taken a cue from Smallville, which for its occasional silliness *really* captures the essence of what makes Superman great, in addition to updating the cultural aesthetic to present day. Superman Returns seems to be paying homage, visually, to early incarnations (architecture, costumes, etc.) which, again, is classy but the nostalgia can be unnecessarily limiting.

I wonder if he really studied the Superman movies of the 70s and 80s.  He really did the part justice.  As for Kate Bosworth as Lois, she did a fair job, but Margot Kidder made a better Lois.

This kid has heart, potential and I don't have to worry about him being typecast as Superman. Brandon Routh sounds like Robert F. Kennedy. Brandon Routh was more like Spider-Man and Peter Parker than Clark Kent and Superman.  I would have think would have been like if he played Spider-Man instead of Tobey Maguire, I think he would've done it better.  In Superman Returns, he looks like more like a child than an adult, he looks like he was eighteen.  Just like when Dean Cain was playing Lois & Clark, he looks more like a child than an adult.  Brandon was playing Superman Returns, he was different like all the other Superman's who played, here he shows that he has problems, feelings and a nice nerdy guy image than I seen.  When I seen Lois and Clark had a kid in the end of Lois & Clark series finale, I keep what this kid would be.  Here's the answers in Superman Returns, the kid just turned out to be just fine.  Jason is kind of like Clark himself back then, that has problems, notting fitting it and feeling like his dad. Jason looks at Clark and Superman, they felt really close, and realize he's not the only one knows what's it like being a nerd. Jason likes Clark and Superman and become best pals.  In the movie, Jason whose Clark's biological son and Lois's mom is dating somebody else.  The next sequel, I think her fiancee Richard White is not going to take it really well that Jason is not his son and he's Clark's kid.  Brandon has a long way to go, if he was ever in Buffy, I think he would have played Xander Harris really well.  I always compare him to Xander Harris, Peter Parker, Jim Levenstien and Kevin Myers in American Pie that's how Brandon brings in Superman everyday when he's compared to these guys.

Sarhan ""matured reviewer""","[6, 9]","Once John William's extraordinary score comes blasting out with the title Superman Returns popping up on the screen, and the credits flying across the screen (a nod to the original Superman film), I felt like jumping and cheering. Unfortunately, that was to be the most excitement I would get throughout the 150 minutes I spent watching the most disappointing sequel of the year so far.You can't help but watch Superman Returns and think about Christopher Reeve, Jackie Cooper, Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman, Marc Maclure, and Marlon Brando (the only actor from the original that we actually see and hear in Returns). The reason why you can't stop thinking about those actors and hope you can see them onscreen instead of the actual actors who are in the film is because none of the actual stars, excluding Brandon Routh, convinces you that they are Perry White, Lois Lane, Lex Luthor, and Jimmy Olsen.Kate Bosworth is just too young (merely 23 years of age) and not vibrant enough to play Lois. Besides, there is no chemistry between her and Routh, who plays Clark Kent and Superman pretty swell! Kal Penn, who played Kumar in Harold And Kumar Go To White Castle, plays one of Luthor's thugs, but his character doesn't speak throughout the film (what a waste of comedic talent), the kid who plays Jimmy Olsen is not funny, and annoys you everytime he appears onscreen. Finally, there's Frank Langella (the man who played Skeletor opposite Dolph Lundgren's He-Man in Masters Of The Universe) who doesn't have the natural charm that Cooper brought to the Perry White character.Now let's talk about the script: horrendous. The plot and the plot twists are just one big mess aside from some unnecessary special effects and action sequences (the airplane crashing scene where Lois tumbles from one end of the airplane to another), and Clark Kent drinking beer (didn't Superman confess that he never drinks nor lies in his interview with Lois Lane in the original film? It seems Supe is a liar after all!). Warner seems to have rushed through pre-production picking one of the worse drafts of the scripts for production, but why? I'm not going to go into the details, but what were they thinking with the last 30 minutes of the film? Have they lost their minds? This is a Superman movie...not a Lois Lane movie (I hope those of you who saw it understand what I mean?).The only two good things about the movie are Brandon Routh and the opening credits and musical score.

1023750,AGMW3I34INNYG,B000J10EQU,Stephen Cannon,"[7, 10]","Bryan Singer has undertaken a potentially nightmarish gig for a director in taking on the film that is Superman Returns.  The production had a long and very well-documented road to seeing the light of day, having gone through the Tim Burton/Nicolas Cage proposal, signing and losing Brett Ratner and McG as directors, and commissioning scripts or treatments from the likes of Kevin Smith and JJ Abrams.  Singer, along with scribes Dan Harris and Michael Dougherty, goes the route of paying homage to the 1978 blockbuster that launched the career of Christopher Reeve.  ""Returns"" takes place five years after the events of Superman II (1980), but is set in the present.  Why? My theory is because Superman, like most of his superhero compatriots, works best when we can relate to him.  Superman (Brandon Routh, bearibng a striking resemblance to Reeve) has been gone for over five years, investigating the possibility that his homeworld of Krypton did not explode, only to return to a world that has mostly forgotten him.  Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth)is partially to blame for that, having won a Pulitzer for her editorial ""Why the World Doesn't Need Superman.""  She's engaged to a sort of human version of Superman, Richard White (James Marsden, who gives a nice, subtle performance), and has a 5 year old son, Jason(Tristan Lake Leabu).  Gruff Daily Planet Editor-In Chief Perry White (Frank Langella, a nice bit of casting) is glad to see one of his top reporters return, as is Clark's (and Superman's) pal, Jimmy Olsen(Sam Huntington, who is very fun to watch).  Not everyone is happy about the return of Supes, particularly Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey, unbelievably joyful to watch), who is hatching yet another scheme.  Lex's brilliance is hampered slightly by a new bumbling gang of idiots, headed by Parker Posey as Kitty Kowalski.The real treat is that Superman Returns maintains a lighthearted quality while embracing a slightly darker world.  Superman/Clark and Lois have more to contend with emotionally, and the world does seem a bit more cynical.  In the face of all this, there's a certain whimsy to it all, helped by the recycling of John Williams' themes in a new score by John Ottman.  This Superman is more drama, and a bit less action, but the action is quite a sight.  Singer clearly has great affection for Richard Donner's vision of the Man of Steel, but while he does capture some of the qualities of the character's 1978 incarnation, there's more exploration here of the internal troubles that our hero might be dealing with, namely isolation and the need to belong.  Only at teh end of the film do we feel like these issues are resolved for Superman, in a touching twist that may leave purists in an uproar.  With the exception of Kate Bosworth, all of the actors are brilliantly cast and shine in their roles.  Brandon Routh carries some of Christopher Reeve's mannerisms into Clark and Superman, but imbues the character with a deeper sense of personal anguish when it comes to his apparently failed relationship with Lois and his undying love for her.  He is clearly a star in the making.  Kevin Spacey was an obvious choice as Lex, and he brings both humor and menace to the classic villian, conveying a wonderfully nuanced and individual riff on Superman's most iconic nemesis.The reviews of this film have been widely divided: some love, some hate, some are indifferent.  As a kid who first saw the 1978 film, my first,  at a drive-in wearing Superman Pjs and a tie on cape at the age of 3 and a half and is a lifelong DC comics geek, I can't help but love this movie.  There are some bits that don't work, but they are brief.  The film does not achieve perfection, and it is not the definitive Superman film.  With the large mythology that has been built around the character, I doubt that such a thing could be made.  But it is to me a different version of what the Donner Superman is: a fantastical tale that breathes life into my first hero.  In my mind, it is a wirthy sequel to the first two films.  I would say it is a much better film than number two, which delved into more outright campiness and lost its hero (maybe the Richard Donner cut of film 2 will rectify that).  This is one of the better Superhero films to have been made, and is worth your money if you love the characters and are willing to allow them to mature.

1023751,A3BF406QD641VI,B000J10EQU,"Stephen Spotswood ""Star Gazing""","[11, 24]","I was generally disappointed in the movie Superman Returns.  It seemed like the ingredients were there, they just never jelled.  Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth both seemed way too young to have a backstory, and literally zero chemistry together.  There were serious lapses in the logic of the script as well.  Superman and Clark Kent both disappeared five years ago, and they both show up again on the same day with no one noticing?  And not only that, but after this long absence, Clark seems to just waltz into his old job at they Daily Planet as if nothing had happened?  I did like the rescue scene with the jet, however, in both these and other FX scenes, Superman's physique seemed to change to one much bigger.  In the scene in the hospital, where they took off Superman's shirt, his chest didn't look all that big.  This was as disconcerting as the animated flying sequences in the original Kirk Alyn serials.  Routh's costume had a strange rubbery look to it, and it was obvious they were aping the more beleagured Spiderman. I constantly felt like I wasn't watching a new Superman movie as much as a remake of a Christopher Reeve one.  Surely Superman has more villains than just Lex Luthor and his grand real estate schemes!  They even had the same John Williams score, and Marlon Brando's droning monotone.  I always thought that the first Reeve's movie toed the line of bad taste with that Marlon Brandon bit of monologue about giving us his only son in pseudo-Biblical language.  Superman Returns didn't just toe the line but stomped all over it.On the plus side I did like the Art Deco look, and the casting of both Perry White (Frank Langella) and Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington).  Although I would have prefered Brendon Frasier as Superman, he probably couldn't make as many sequels as Routh.  Like Batman Returns, I'm looking foreward to the sequel to see how they do without having to reintroduce the characters all over again.Whatever happened to super heroes with that certain joie de vivre?",2,Enough With The Hamlet Wannabes,1164585600,"11 27, 2006",2006,2010,"['was', 'generally', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'seemed', 'ingredients', 'were', 'there', 'just', 'never', 'jelled', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'seemed', 'way', 'too', 'young', 'have', 'backstory', 'literally', 'zero', 'chemistry', 'together', 'were', 'serious', 'lapses', 'logic', 'script', 'as', 'well', 'Superman', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'disappeared', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'show', 'up', 'again', 'same', 'day', 'one', 'noticing', 'not', 'only', 'long', 'absence', 'Clark', 'just', 'waltz', 'old', 'job', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'nothing', 'had', 'happened', 'did', 'rescue', 'scene', 'jet', 'however', 'other', 'FX', 'scenes', 'Superman', 'physique', 'seemed', 'change', 'one', 'much', 'bigger', 'scene', 'hospital', 'where', 'took', 'off', 'Superman', 'shirt', 'chest', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'big', 'was', 'as', 'disconcerting', 'animated', 'flying', 'sequences', 'original', 'Kirk', 'Alyn', 'serials', 'Routh', 'costume', 'had', 'strange', 'rubbery', 'look', 'was', 'obvious', 'were', 'aping', 'more', 'beleagured', 'Spiderman', 'constantly', 'felt', 'was', ""n't"", 'watching', 'new', 'Superman', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'remake', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'one', 'Surely', 'Superman', 'more', 'villains', 'just', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'grand', 'real', 'estate', 'schemes', 'even', 'had', 'same', 'John', 'Williams', 'score', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'droning', 'monotone', 'always', 'thought', 'first', 'Reeve', 'movie', 'toed', 'line', 'bad', 'taste', 'Marlon', 'Brandon', 'bit', 'monologue', 'giving', 'only', 'son', 'pseudo-Biblical', 'language', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'toe', 'line', 'stomped', 'it.On', 'plus', 'side', 'did', 'Art', 'Deco', 'look', 'casting', 'Perry', 'White', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'Sam', 'Huntington', 'would', 'have', 'prefered', 'Brendon', 'Frasier', 'Superman', 'probably', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'many', 'sequels', 'Routh', 'Batman', 'Returns', ""'m"", 'looking', 'foreward', 'sequel', 'see', 'how', 'do', 'having', 'reintroduce', 'characters', 'again.Whatever', 'happened', 'super', 'heroes', 'certain', 'joie', 'vivre']",N/A
1023752,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B000J10EQU,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[0, 6]","Superman Returns shows us just how much we have all missed Superman and still need him.  Of course, comparisons to Christopher Reeve are inevitable as he made the role his own, but Routh makes it his own as well.  Although he looks and sounds just like Reeve, intended by the studio no doubt, he is a good actor who brings depth to the role.  Okay, now for the specifics on the film:Plot: Well-conceived improvement over similar ideas presented in Superman I and II (slicing off California to enhance property value at the fault line and monkeying around with the Fortress of Solitude).  I also think it was a terrific idea to have this film pick up after Superman II where Lois and Superman, while reduce to a normal guy, get together.  This allows us to forget the dreaded sequels that followed and breathes life into the franchise with perhaps a ""superboy"" down the road.  In addition, this element in the story reminds us how Superman takes the high moral ground.  In Superman II he selfishly gave up his powers to sleep with Lois Lane and after realizing this error he sacrifices a normal life for the lonely hero life as the world still needs him.  To invade Lois's and his son's life at this point would be morally wrong and as equally selfish as when he gave up his powers in Superman II for a chance at a regular life and he knows it and, therefore, decides to step back from Lois and his own son's life (although we see he obviously cares when he observes them without them knowing it).  That's one big sacrifice and NOT a shirking of his duties as one reviewer here suggested.Character Development/Acting: Much time is devoted to character development than in most superhero films of the past (excluding X-Men and Spider-Man), especially regarding James Marsden of X-Men fame who is now Lois Lane's husband to be.  He has to struggle with the memory and return of the Man of Steel, and trying to be the best man for Lois and hero to his own son (who is really Superman's son).  He is very believable in this role.  Frank Langella is perfect as newspaper head and Lois Lane is wonderfully played by Kate Bosworth even to the point where you wish she was the original Lois Lane.  I never cared for Margot Kidder much in that role so I'm a bit bias here.  Of course, a superhero film isn't complete without the villain and Lex Luther as played by Kevin Spacey is perfect casting.  We never really feared Gene Hackman's Lex as he was a bit too cartoonish even though he damn near stole the second movie right out from under Superman.  Kevin is funny where he needs to be and punishingly ruthless where he has to be.Last, but not least is Brandon Routh, AKA Superman.  He knows he has big shoes to fill not just in Reeve's command of the role before him, but also in that many learned to love Reeve during his tragic post-Superman life wherein he really proved he was Superman with the courage he faced everyday while being a paraplegic.  I am one of those who grew to love and appreciate Christopher Reeve and I cried at his passing as did my children.  Someone new taking over this role established so well by a beloved actor has it's challenges and just as many are leary of Daniel Craig as the new Bond, some may be just as suspicious of Routh's Superman.  No need to be.  He pulls off the role with great skill and respect.  You can see the sadness in his eyes when he learns that Lois has moved on without him, had a son, is about to get married, and no longer believes the world needs Superman.  He is perfect for the role in spite of the studio's wish to simply find someone to mimic the looks of Reeve.  Routh is an acting find for this role and I look forward to seeing him in other roles as well.Director:  Who best to work behind the camera on this than veteran action TV series and X-Men movie director Bryan Singer.  He continues to prove his metal, forgive the pun, while working on the Man of Steel.  The story is well-paced between action sequences that are truly breathtaking and the plot and character development sequences.  He did a bang up job with this film.Special Effects:  Well, what is a superhero movie without them?  Those in this film are mind-boggling, especially the plane sequence in the early part of the film.  In fact, that sequence is probably the best in the film, but that doesn't mean the rest are poor, just not as good.""Superman Returns"" is fun for the whole family except those really young ones who might get a bit upset over the punishing beating Superman gets when he temporarily loses his powers late in the film.  That beating is rather graphic, hence the PG-13 rating.",5,Superman Returns . . .

The special effects were excellent  - there's now virtually nothing they can't do, and everyone on the cast were talented and likable.But I have to subtract two stars because..this felt like the imitation of a great movie, rather than a great original work of Film.  I've seen so many Supermans that this one felt like a retread when it needed something vibrant and alive and new.They borrowed the Marlon Brando bit..virtually every word of dialog here sounded canned and predictable.  This is a kids movie..while the first two Superman films written by Mario Puzo (the Godfather series) really built a whole new legend and franchise. Brandon Routh's superman seems shallower .. He's likable, but he just doesn't have enough to say..probably because this is supposed to be a sequel to Superman II from 1981, so the whole stage has been set already.. But it's been 23 years and this is a new work, and as such it lacked personality.It's had a good opening weekend and generally good press, but I predict it won't have much staying power.

Superman fans couldn't have got it better.The fact that the replacement for the new Superman, Brandon Routh, being modelled after the late Christopher Reeve and his legacy is something to be lauded. The drop-dead handsome Brandon Routh excels on all fronts,  performance, style and looks. Kate Bosworth plays an adorable Louis and you couldn't ask for a better villian to replace Gene Hackman than the talented Kevin Spacey.With almost two decades of growth in special effects from the last Superman that we saw in the 80's, it was only anybody's guess that the special effects of Superman Returns had to be better. Superman Returns certainly doesn't disappoint those who came to watch this film for the effects alone. Amazing stuff.The plot and story aren't bad either. The nice twist in the end about Louis's son was the icing on the cake. The movie is engaging and never with a dull moment except for some of the concluding scenes.The only blooper of course is one that runs from the very first Superman movie.

His angst over Lois, his battles agains Lex are all very genuine performances.  I think he fit the part of superman perfectly.The person whose role I was let down the most with is Lex Luther.

I also like the CW's hit show Smallville which focuses on the early years of Clark Kent before he became Superman.This movie was really awesome. The special effects were amazing and breath-taking. Newcomer Brandon Routh made the legendary role of Clark Kent/Superman, (living two lives of a reporter and a superhero) his. No other actor could have done a better job. The story plot follows when Superman takes a bad fall and decides to take an absence of fighting crime. He doesnt even say good-bye. Meanwhile Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) manages to come up with a plan to destroy the world ( as usual). Superman must stop him or the whole world will be destroyed.Kate Bosworth ( Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!) did an excellent job as reporter Lois Lane, both Clark Kent and Superman's love interest. Lois mainly is infatuated with Superman and they share so much of chemical romance together. When he leaves, she is upset which causes her to write an article for The Daily Planet titled ""Why the World Doesn't need Superman"" which causes her to win The Pulitzer prize for best journalism. When Superman does return she falls in love with him all over again-but since he had taken an absense for many years Lois has had a son and a fiance named Richard (James Marsden). There is a bit of a love triangle in the movie.Each role has their own depth to it and the movie gets into their roles a lot. Obviously Superman does defeat Lex Luthor and his side-kicks. As well as his girlfriend Kitty ( Parker Posey).I really enjoyed watching this movie. Director Bryan Singer did a good job with the choice of actors for each role. There is some mystery about the child Lois has-could be Clarks. And also the sad thing is Superman doesnt end up with Lois. It may be possible to make a sequel but it wont be out for awhile is what I've heard. It also is kind of hard with the plot to make a sequel-if they want it to be better than the first. The sequel probably wont be out for 2 and a half-3 years. Brandon Routh, Kate Bosworth, and Kevin Spacey should be back for the sequel. This movie gave breakthrough roles for Both Routh and Bosworth they probably have been offered many roles.We hope to see Superman soon!",5,Best Movie Of The Summer!,1153180800,"07 18, 2006",2006,2301,"['really', 'liked', 'movie', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'super-hero', 'movies', 'X-Men', 'Superman', 'Batman', 'mostly', 'also', 'CW', 'hit', 'show', 'Smallville', 'early', 'years', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'became', 'Superman.This', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'awesome', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'amazing', 'breath-taking', 'Newcomer', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'made', 'legendary', 'role', 'Clark', 'Kent/Superman', 'living', 'two', 'lives', 'reporter', 'superhero', 'other', 'actor', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'story', 'plot', 'when', 'Superman', 'bad', 'fall', 'take', 'absence', 'fighting', 'crime', 'doesnt', 'even', 'say', 'good-bye', 'Meanwhile', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'come', 'up', 'plan', 'destroy', 'world', 'usual', 'Superman', 'must', 'stop', 'whole', 'world', 'will', 'be', 'destroyed.Kate', 'Bosworth', 'Win', 'Date', 'Tad', 'Hamilton', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'reporter', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Superman', 'love', 'interest', 'Lois', 'mainly', 'infatuated', 'Superman', 'share', 'so', 'much', 'chemical', 'romance', 'together', 'When', 'upset', 'write', 'article', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'titled', 'Why', 'World', 'Does', ""n't"", 'need', 'Superman', 'win', 'Pulitzer', 'prize', 'best', 'journalism', 'When', 'Superman', 'return', 'love', 'again-but', 'had', 'taken', 'absense', 'many', 'years', 'Lois', 'had', 'son', 'fiance', 'named', 'Richard', 'James', 'Marsden', 'bit', 'love', 'triangle', 'movie.Each', 'role', 'own', 'depth', 'movie', 'roles', 'lot', 'Obviously', 'Superman', 'defeat', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'side-kicks', 'As', 'well', 'girlfriend', 'Kitty', 'Parker', 'Posey', '.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'movie', 'Director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'choice', 'actors', 'role', 'mystery', 'child', 'Lois', 'has-could', 'be', 'Clarks', 'also', 'sad', 'thing', 'Superman', 'doesnt', 'end', 'up', 'Lois', 'may', 'be', 'possible', 'make', 'sequel', 'wont', 'be', 'out', 'awhile', 'what', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'also', 'kind', 'hard', 'plot', 'make', 'sequel-if', 'want', 'be', 'better', 'first', 'sequel', 'probably', 'wont', 'be', 'out', '2', 'half-3', 'years', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'should', 'be', 'back', 'sequel', 'movie', 'gave', 'breakthrough', 'roles', 'Routh', 'Bosworth', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'offered', 'many', 'roles.We', 'hope', 'see', 'Superman', 'soon']",N/A

This movie is seeing the character on the big screen afetr a long time, but doesn;t reflect the complete character and his world.  Bryan Singer and his team seemed to have seen the first movie of Superman and that is it.  Watch the making of documentary and you will see one of his crew members reading ""The Making Of Superman: The Movie"" instead of a Superman comic book. This made me feel bad especially with my favorite superhero.  Why is it that the animated features and shows go full out with the enemies and stories until we hit film and there is this tied down feeling with only one villian, Lex Luthor...as if Braniac, Metallo, Darkseid, Toyman, Parasite, Titano, Lobo, Gog, Bloodsport, Atlas, Doomsday, and others would never be seen in Superman film universe (makes us feel lucky they used Zod for 1.2 films).  Also, switching the romance and add the child of _______ into the story makes no sense and illustrates no one did their homework.  Imagine if Peter Jackson made Lord of The Rings with only seeing the animated TV special Return Of The King in the 80s without reading any of the books, the trilogy would be a one movie deal and a musical.They did put a lot of hard work into the movie to make it look good, but I wish they tried more with the characters and the story.  That's difference with Batman Begins and Superman Returns...Christopher Nolan being more of a fan of the superhero's mythology rather than liking a few films of done in the past.The story is written from the outside looking into the character at a distance.  The movie is enjoyable to see Superman on the big screen but fails to give Superman the credit he has in the comic books.  It fails to take him to the next level of where he is now.  Smallville is doing a better job at the mythology.  Minus 2 stars for story and lack of work, but the movie is made well and may please anyone who doesn't know much about Superman but the basics to pass a Trivial Persuit game.  One golden rule is that Kryptonians cannot impregnate humans, this is not a hay wire sci fi world where different species genes can magically mix up.  This rule is broken.  Also Clark doesn't drink alcohol and Superman does appear in court...we even saw this in the Justice League animated series.I got this movie to support the Man Of Steel and the middle part is fun especially the airplane save & bullet eye shot.  Hang in there for the future for Superman and I highly recommend Superman: Doomsday and Superman/Batman: Public Enemies for those are way closer to the character and those great books.

Since comics is a industry where the core demographic is men, why on Earth would Singer think fans would want to see Superman:The Love Story? Honestly there is a part of the movie that involves a hospital and Lois and I thought the theme to ""Love Story"" would start playing. I think hearing the fans talking about the lack of action Singer said a sequel would be his ""wrath of khan"" movie, with mucho action, if your a Star Trek fan, you would think that analogy is that Superman Returns is like Star Trek:The Motion Picture, very long, boring and just a showcase for improved special effects, where Wrath of Khan brought Star Trek back to where it should be, I would think you would want your first movie to be that kind of good, not boring and way to long.The roles were badly miscast, Bosworths portrayal of Lois Lane was about as wooden as you can get, not to mention way to young looking for a veteran journalist, and Superman is missing for 5 years and nobody, even his love Lois is worried, maybe he was kidnapped, killed..she writes ""why the world doesn't need Superman"" and wins a pulitzer, I would think it would be ""Where is Superman?"" and the chemistry between Routh and Bosworth well there was none, and Routh hardly said anything so who knows about his acting ablities.Singer not understanding the Superman character, after coming back from a 5 year abstence, finding out Lois is engaged and has a child, takes her on romantic flights, and seems to try and win her back,not very Superman like, oh and Superman drinks now,and uses his xray vision to spy on Lois, I don't think he smokes but who knows from Singers ""loose sequel"" ""vague history"" whatever it is, he might lie pretty good to as well.Singer and the writers can't figure out how Kryptonite works, or just didn't bother to research it, along with Superman himself that goes away from the love story,who cares about actually staying true to the character,it's the directors VISION that counts.Plotholes to many to even list..way to many.All in all, some nice effects, but very weak story, doesn't know if it's a remake or a sequel, the romance shouldn't be the main part of superhero movie, Luthor is good and all but in every Superman film as the villian? c'mon he has other villians, Brainiac or Parasite anyone,like having the Green Goblin as the villian in every Spidey movie.

1023765,A1B9ISLYYCHIVE,B000J10EQU,"The Curmudgeon ""Your life lacks purpose - my ...","[11, 16]","You gotta wonder what went through director Bryan Singer's head. After pretty much re-inventing the comic book movie wheel with the first two X-Men movies, he wisely stepped away from the franchise (resulting in the bloated dross that was X-Men: Last Stand), deciding to concentrate on a new superhero film, starring the world's best known hero.And guess what? It's even WORSE than the film he walked away from.For starters, Singer (along with seemingly the rest of the world) seems to think that the 1970s Superman movie, and in particular Christopher Reeve, are the only representations of the DC comic book. What's the first thing you read about new Supes Brandon Routh, what's the first thing people had to say about him? ""Oh, he looks JUST like Christopher Reeve!"" SO WHAT? Why is it so essential to stay fixated on those movies? Why do we never hear references made to the Kirk Alyn Superman? Or George Reeves, who (arguably) made an even bigger impact in the tights than his similarly named counterpart?But I digress. So, Superman Returns, then. Taken five years after Superman II (with Superman 3 and 4 being nixed from continuity - hmmm, messing around with continuity and carelessly discarding what's come before it? Yup, it's based on a DC comic, alright), we find that, for no real reason, Superman flew away for five years and let Lois Lane grow both more attractive and several years younger. That was nice of him. And wouldn't you know it, he's not back five minutes and already Lois is in dire peril - how did she survive all this time without him?While we're on the subject of Superman III and IV being wiped out because they were, well, crap, let's get one thing straight; the entire Superman FRANCHISE, including those holier than thou first two movies, aren't exactly perfect either. There are dozens of howlers in those movies, from Superman flying around the world so fast he turns back time (um, why not just do that for EVERYTHING bad that happens?), to Superman kissing Lois and WIPING HER MEMORY (it's Rohypnol Man!). Are we to pretend those things didn't happen as well?Anyway, in this one, what follows is a plot so ludicrous and half-baked you often wonder whether you should laugh or feel insulted. True, Superman is the most boring, two-dimensional character in comics, but even he deserves a better story than this. Spacey, a great actor, thinks hamming it up and yelling is all you need to be a great villain (if we're going to be obsessed with the 70s films, Gene Hackman was a much, much better Luthor), the chemistry between Lois and Clark is non-existent, and let's get to the REAL one-fingered salute to the fans, the franchise and the comic books themselves. If you want to avoid spoilers, look away now..Lois has a son from ""another guy."" Who, after playing piano with the nicest kidnapper in the world, suddenly reveals he has SUPER POWERS TOO. That's right - it's actually Superman's son! Not only would this be a biological impossibility, (wouldn't Clark's Super Sperm, just, you know, blast right through Lois?) but it also kills the entire series STONE DEAD. So, what, are we going to have SuperBoy in the next film (and make no mistake about it, Superman Returns is an obvious attempt at a franchise starter)? So we're basically going to ignore decades of continuity and just make stuff up for no reason?And then there's the fact that Superman isn't exactly, well, Super in this film to begin with. Yeah, he does some (nice looking) stuff like catching airplanes and having bullets bounce off his eyeballs, but when it really comes down to it, all he does it sulk, pick things up, and then get the snot beaten out of him by Luthor.

The results are mixed (I actually give the film ***1/2 stars).After the events of ""Superman II"", ""Superman Returns"" starts off with the Man Of Steel returning to Earth after a five year absence. It looked like astronmers had found the remains of what looked to be the burnt out planet of Krypton, Supes' his homeworld & Kal-El had to find out if anyone was home. Finding out that he truly is the last of his people, Superman returns to his real home, Earth.As for Superman's arch-nemesis Lex Luthor, he's free after Superman fails to show up for his parole hearing.""How much do you think that pisses off Superman?"", asks Jimmy Olsen.""A lot."", replies an unamused Clark Kent, stunned by the news.Lex is also back in the green after swindling an inheritance from a millionairess, early on in the film.In the wake of Superman's mysterious dissapearance, the people of Metropolis realize that maybe they don't need a Superman afterall. That's the big question that Big Blue has to face. Will people accept his return? Do they really need him?Things don't actually look up for Clark Kent on his return to ""The Daily Planet"". Sure, he got his old job back, but, it's a one two punch that sends him to the local bar, in search of a drink, after finding out that Lois Lane has written a Pulitzer Prize winning essay on why the world doesn't need Superman, has moved on with her life with her five year old son & is engaged to Richard White, Perry's nephew, associate editor to ""The Daily Planet"", & father (?) to Lois' son.It's at the local sports bar, having a beer with Jimmy Olsen (the only one that seems happy to see him back), & a dangerous mishap with a NASA space shuttle, that Clark Kent makes up his mind to bring Superman back into the public eye.While most of the people of Earth embrace the return of Superman, two people aren't happy to see his arrival.Lois Lane, originally, heartbroken & now, angry has quite a few questions for her former boyfriend.As for Lex Luthor, he's making a huge land grab that will sink most of America underwater, thanks to some Kryptonian crystals pilfered from Superman's Fortress Of Solitude & Kryptonite stolen from a local museum.Of course, it's not a Superman film without Lois getting into trouble & all hell breaking loose thereafter. After some snooping around, trying to find out the cause of a mysterious citywide blackout, Lois, with her son in tow, accidently lands on a yacht that belongs to a freshly showered millonaire.""Lex Luthor.""""Lois Lane?!""""Your bald.""It's up to Superman to save Lois, her son (who may or might not have the White family blood running through him), & the U.S. of A from Lex Luthor's ""Century 21"" making disaster.""Superman Returns"" is one of those films that should be epic & fun, but, comes off big & by the numbers. I expected a lot more from director, Bryan Singer. There are quite a few loopholes to the film. ""Returns"" can't hold a match to the first two ""Superman"" films (those are still tops).""Superman Returns""' main & ultimately crippling problem is that it lacks the charm, warmth, & humor of ""Superman: The Movie"" & ""Superman II"" & this problem spreads throughout the film's lead charcter's. The chemistry between Lois & Superman is practically non-existent (they don't even kiss for God's sake!), & the big battle between Lex & Supes is lame & could be akin to a New York gang mugging.Brandon Routh does a passable job in the title role, but, in some scenes it seems as if Routh is doing an empty impression of Reeve. The classic Superman flyby that ends each ""Super"" film is mechanically done here. Oddly, of all the character's in the film Superman gets the least lines. The scenes where Superman secretly looks in on Lois & her family, & the scene where he watches, what might be his own son, sleeping are actually, & I hate to say it, a bit creepy.Kate Bosworth is too young to be playing Lois Lane. Her Lane is more of a smoking, soccer mom than a hard-nosed reporter. The thin plotline of Lois' son possibly being Superman's is just ludicrous. Remember, Superman gave up his powers in ""II"" in order to be with Lois. Only after learning about the Phantom Zone criminals taking over the world, did Supes go back & retrieve his super powers.Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor is one of the saving graces of ""Superman Returns"" (the action scenes are the other saving grace). His Luthor is more inline with Gene Hackman's portrayal than Spacey admits. However, Spacey doesn't bring that sense of menace that both Hackman & Michael Rosenbaum (Luthor in ""Smallville"") to their roles.  The scene where Luthor discovers Lois & her son aboard his yacht & the scene on the island near film's end are priceless. Parker Posey is dissmissable as Kitty (Posey was better as Gail Weathers in ""Scream 3""). Valerie Perrine's, Miss Teschmacher & Ned Beatty's, bumbling Otis are sorely missed.The action scenes are pretty much what makes ""Superman Returns"" worth watching, especially the shuttle/airplane sequence.Superman's return is a welcome one but it's not an epic one.""Superman Returns"" flies home on DVD on November 28, 2006. Two editions will be available both in the 2.40:1 film aspect ratio. The first is either wide or full screen & contains just the film.

1023767,A20TJ5P97W5MS1,B000J10EQU,The Inquisitor,"[0, 1]",Who is the Man of Steel? This is an interesting take on the Superman series. Due to the classic nature of the first couple Superman films there was high expectations set for Superman Returns. An important note about this installment is that it is actually the fifth and final installment in the original Superman film series and serves as a sequel to Superman and Superman II. This film ignores the events of Superman III and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. The basic premise is that Superman (Brandon Routh)  was gone for 5 years of soul searching and now he is back. At the same time the evil mastermind Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is also back and plotting to take over the entire world. All the rest of the key characters are here as well and the film actually makes a successful transition from the original second installment of the series. Overall it is a great action packed return to form for the Man of Steel. A new character is also introduced in Superman Returns. As you watch the film you will find out who it this individual is and you may find the connection quite interesting.,5,The Empire 5 Star 500 - #60,1310515200,"07 13, 2011",2011,1092,"['Who', 'Man', 'Steel', 'interesting', 'take', 'Superman', 'series', 'Due', 'classic', 'nature', 'first', 'couple', 'Superman', 'films', 'was', 'high', 'expectations', 'set', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'important', 'note', 'installment', 'actually', 'fifth', 'final', 'installment', 'original', 'Superman', 'film', 'series', 'sequel', 'Superman', 'Superman', 'II', 'film', 'events', 'Superman', 'III', 'Superman', 'IV', 'Quest', 'Peace', 'basic', 'premise', 'Superman', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'was', 'gone', '5', 'years', 'soul', 'searching', 'now', 'back', 'same', 'time', 'evil', 'mastermind', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'also', 'back', 'plotting', 'take', 'over', 'entire', 'world', 'rest', 'key', 'characters', 'are', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'actually', 'successful', 'transition', 'original', 'second', 'installment', 'series', 'Overall', 'great', 'action', 'packed', 'return', 'form', 'Man', 'Steel', 'new', 'character', 'also', 'introduced', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'watch', 'film', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'individual', 'may', 'find', 'connection', 'quite', 'interesting']",N/A
1023768,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B000J10EQU,The Mysterious Traveler,"[3, 4]","SUPERMAN RETURNS(2006) Directed and Written by Bryan Singer.Starring Brandon Routh, Kate Bosworth, Frank Langella, Eva Marie Saint, James Marsden, Parker Posey and Keven Spacey.One cannot say that Singer did a terribly brilliant job and he brought very little to the table that was of any worth and more than a bit that was unnessarary but Superman is such a powerful character that all one has to do is not screw it up and you have a passable film. Singer did not screw it up so it is passable..but I hope he does not stay for the next film.The film is well directed visually and in terms of pacing. The film's use of color is generally very poor. Superman's cape does not appear to be red nor do his boots. Even when the sun is shining, the film appears to be taking place at night. I thought most of the cast were underplaying something fierce and consequently very few registered. Routh is okay as Superman but is basically doing a Christopher Reeve impersonation but that is fine. One can live with him. It is hoped that the next film allows him to have more dialogue. It seems to me that everyone is babbling away around him while he does monosyllables. Spacey is a very slight improvement over Hackman PLAYING Lex Luther leaning more towards Lyle Talbot's take on the character but he still comes across as a mere evil real estate salesman. Everyone else is disposable with the odd exception of James Marsden as Lois Lane's unmarried spouse. One was more interested in his character emotionally than anyone else save Superman...which is probably a flaw rather than a good thing.The film's problems are as follows. Singer does not seem to like Superman over much. He is constantly being told off or mocked by characters either indirectly or to his face. The costume is very dark and looks dirty. Everyone has already heard that the Truth, Justice and the American Way line is tossed off with contempt. Lois Lane is, if possible, even more unlikable than in her 30s/40s period and Bosworth's vapid empty performance does not help.. While Luthor is slightly more serious this time out, he is also unaccountably more stupid. He is constantly taking actions that, for a criminal genius, are moronic. He is going to create a new continent using kryptonian technology. Yet when asked how he will fend off other nations attempting to claim the land for their own, he says he will fight them off using that same tech--yet all we see him with are a couple of laptops and a few suitcases. WHAT offensive Kryptonian technology does he have? Apparently none. He is on a private yacht when the continent begins to form--which he promptly abandons for no good reason with a helicopter that it turns out does NOT have enough fuel to reach the mainland. How was Luthor going to return to shore? Why abandon the yacht rather than chug out of harm's way for awhile. We later learn that Luthor has no food supplies yet we see him and his gang happily sitting in a cave on the new continent. The new continent is a barren rock. There is no food. The Chopper does not have enough fuel. He has no offensive weaponry. Just WHAT was Luthor thinking of doing???Another Luthor related problem that is a holdover from the original series is that the character here--rather than being a brilliant super scientist--is really more of a parasite unable to accomplish anything without stealing and/or making use of other people's creations. In the first film, it was US tech. The second Kryptonian. Here the same. Only in the fourth film did we ever see Luthor actually BE a brilliant Super scientist..and that film is unjustly derided.Another odd problem is also conversely the film's strength. To wit: the film is practically a shot for shot remake of the first film. Luthor's plot is much the same as before only bigger and with more cgi. His moll goes through the same story arc as the Valerie Perrine character in the first film. We get much the same dialogue and situations only tweaked. Luthor traps Supes with kryptonite and tosses him in water to drown where he is saved by a woman. Only here it is Lois and not Miss Tessmacher. Luthor explains his plans in his abode only here it is to Lois and not to Supes. A Kryptonian space ship crashes lands on the Kent farm where Mrs Kent finds her son. Supes save Lois from a crashing aircraft and then lecturers on the safety of flying. An averted plane crash by the way is directly swiped from the animated film SUPERMAN: THE LAST SON OF KRYPTON. Marlon Brando is trotted out to speak the same dialogue as he did in the first film. A major earthquake hits a major port city. Superman puts a stop to things by lifting a large rock.On the other hand, since much of the above worked in the first film, it is still exciting here..just very familiar. The question is why watch THIS film when one has the original???What Singer brings to the proceedings besides his unoriginality and distaste for the character is a Jimmy Olsen who is coded as being gay without ever coming out and saying it. A silly subplot about how Luthor got out of jail that was overly complex, added nothing to the proceedings and was not required. Luthor could have just broken out of jail. An anti-marriage agenda that is understandable coming from Gay Agenda Singer but not required in a Superman film. The whole thing of having Superman return from what was basically a great big silly and irresponsible wild goose chase also seemed unnecessary. Just have another adventure of Superman! The bastard son of Superman plotline which can be nothing but a problem for future installments of the series and is only there so Singer can have sooner or later another of his ""Dad. I am different and not like other men"" Gay Agenda moments. Superman dies not ONCE but TWICE in the film to diminishing returns. The thundering and repeated(5 times) antismoking propaganda barrage is so blatant that the last scene of the film is where Lois decides to stop smoking. THAT is the main message of the film. Don't smoke. And there is a nasty dog joke(and the film is generally unpleasant to canines in every scene in which they appear) that was not appreciated by me and very alien to the material. This is a Superman film Singer not a Monty Python sketch.The film is also decided claustrophobic. Where the earlier films felt as if they were part of the planet with American Presidents, the Arms race etc all being involved, this film feels cut off from all that. I don't even think there is a shot of the American flag anywhere.Still the film is an entertaining installment that should hopefully jump-start the series again. It is not as good as the first two and the fourth but is better than the third. Which is about as much as can be expected. The film suffers from that somnabulic acting and generally dreariness that seems to inflict many modern hero franchises from the dead on arrival BATMAN BEGINS to the disaster CASINO ROYALE. It is not as fatal here but the film IS generally dark, unlovable, uninspiring and suffers from the blahs. One cannot imagine ever watching it again.Still if they dump Singer, kill Superman Jr, use a villain other than Luthor, maybe we will start getting somewhere.",2,A Political Hack is Kryptonite for

1023773,A3M7RECGYLXOPA,B000J10EQU,The Wickerman,"[2, 3]","Well, it's been a long time since the last Superman movie, and there's been a lot of buzz going around about this long-awaited sequel, as well as a lot of mixed reviews.  And, although my expectations weren't especially high (I loved the first two movies, but the last two were pretty awful), I have to say that I really enjoyed it.There was much speculation about how newcomer Brandon Routh would fare as the Man of Steel, but I would say he was more than adequate.  I do think he was trying a bit too hard to emulate Christopher Reeve, but he did a great job nonetheless.  But the real star here is Kevin Spacey, who did an amazing job as Lex Luthor.  His was a completely different take from the comedic arrogance of Gene Hackman's Lex, and much more along the lines of Michael Rosenbaum's Lex on ""Smallville"": more dark and intense, with a slight hint of insanity.  Parker Posey is also memorable as his ditzy sidekick, Kitty.If there's one thing this movie had on the old ones, it's the special effects.  ""Smallville"" was the first incarnation of ""Superman"" to really up the ante in the special effects department, so it was really cool to see that caliber applied to the big screen.  If nothing else, this movie is great as just pure eye candy, as the effects are really great.  The airplane scene is particularly exhilirating, and it's cool that, as with ""Smallville"", they made his heat vision look like actual heat waves, instead of just the cheesy red laserbeams of old.However, as great as this movie is, I do have a few small complaints.  First of all, as much as I like Kate Bosworth, I have to say that I was really disappointed with her performance as Lois Lane.  To me, she just really didn't seem like Lois at all, and although she's supposed to be older, and have a family and everything, it just really seemed like a completely different character, with none of Lois' trademark personality.  Maybe it's the sceenwriter's fault, and not hers, but I just don't think she brought any kind of familiarity to the character at all.Another small problem I had was the kryptonite thing.  The effects that the kryptonite had on Superman just seemed way too mild.  It's supposed to make him really weak, and be really painful, but in most of the scenes, it barely seems to bother him at all.  Like, there's one part where he lifts a giant piece of rock, filled with kryptonite, into space, while he's got a piece of it stuck in his side.  Under those circumstances, he shouldn't have even been able to get off the ground.  Now, it was supposed to be a sort of synthetic kryptonite, and maybe the effects just weren't supposed to be quite as severe, but that was never really made clear in the movie.  Also, the conflict with Lex seemed a bit too similar to that of the first movie, with him creating a huge natural disaster to make money off rebuilding (he even gives the exact same explanation, with his father telling him about land being a precious resource).But I realize I'm just being way too picky there.  As I said, this is a great movie, and definitely worth seeing at least once if you're into Superman at all.  Also, I thought the ending was really cool, and possibly left the door open for more sequels.  All in all, I'd say it's not quite up there with the first two movies, but definitely way better than the third and fourth.",4,You'll believe a man can fly...again.,1152057600,"07 5, 2006",2006,3349,"['Well', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'last', 'Superman', 'movie', 'been', 'lot', 'buzz', 'going', 'around', 'long-awaited', 'sequel', 'as', 'well', 'lot', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'expectations', 'were', ""n't"", 'especially', 'high', 'loved', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'last', 'two', 'were', 'pretty', 'awful', 'have', 'say', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'it.There', 'was', 'much', 'speculation', 'how', 'newcomer', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'would', 'fare', 'Man', 'Steel', 'would', 'say', 'was', 'more', 'adequate', 'do', 'think', 'was', 'trying', 'bit', 'too', 'hard', 'emulate', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'nonetheless', 'real', 'star', 'here', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'who', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'was', 'completely', 'different', 'take', 'comedic', 'arrogance', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Lex', 'much', 'more', 'lines', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'Lex', 'Smallville', 'more', 'dark', 'intense', 'slight', 'hint', 'insanity', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'also', 'memorable', 'ditzy', 'sidekick', 'Kitty.If', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'had', 'old', 'ones', 'special', 'effects', 'Smallville', 'was', 'first', 'incarnation', 'Superman', 'really', 'up', 'ante', 'special', 'effects', 'department', 'was', 'really', 'cool', 'see', 'caliber', 'applied', 'big', 'screen', 'nothing', 'else', 'movie', 'great', 'just', 'pure', 'eye', 'candy', 'effects', 'are', 'really', 'great', 'airplane', 'scene', 'particularly', 'exhilirating', 'cool', 'that', 'Smallville', 'made', 'heat', 'vision', 'look', 'actual', 'heat', 'waves', 'instead', 'just', 'cheesy', 'red', 'laserbeams', 'old.However', 'as', 'great', 'movie', 'do', 'have', 'few', 'small', 'complaints', 'First', 'all', 'as', 'much', 'like', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'really', 'disappointed', 'performance', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'just', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'Lois', 'supposed', 'be', 'older', 'have', 'family', 'everything', 'just', 'really', 'seemed', 'completely', 'different', 'character', 'none', 'Lois', 'trademark', 'personality', 'sceenwriter', 'fault', 'not', 'hers', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'brought', 'kind', 'familiarity', 'character', 'all.Another', 'small', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'kryptonite', 'thing', 'effects', 'kryptonite', 'had', 'Superman', 'just', 'seemed', 'way', 'too', 'mild', 'supposed', 'make', 'really', 'weak', 'be', 'really', 'painful', 'most', 'scenes', 'barely', 'bother', 'one', 'part', 'where', 'giant', 'piece', 'rock', 'filled', 'kryptonite', 'space', 'got', 'piece', 'stuck', 'side', 'circumstances', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'even', 'been', 'able', 'get', 'off', 'ground', 'Now', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'sort', 'synthetic', 'kryptonite', 'maybe', 'effects', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'quite', 'severe', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'made', 'clear', 'movie', 'Also', 'conflict', 'Lex', 'seemed', 'bit', 'too', 'similar', 'first', 'movie', 'creating', 'huge', 'natural', 'disaster', 'make', 'money', 'rebuilding', 'even', 'exact', 'same', 'explanation', 'father', 'telling', 'land', 'being', 'precious', 'resource', '.But', 'realize', ""'m"", 'just', 'being', 'way', 'too', 'picky', 'there', 'said', 'great', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'least', 'once', ""'re"", 'Superman', 'Also', 'thought', 'ending', 'was', 'really', 'cool', 'possibly', 'left', 'door', 'open', 'more', 'sequels', ""'d"", 'say', 'not', 'quite', 'there', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'definitely', 'way', 'better', 'third', 'fourth']",N/A

1023775,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000J10EQU,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 6]","There is a lot familiar, good and well executed in ""Superman Returns"". But in some ways, this works against the film, adding to its many faults.Superman (Brandon Routh) returns to Earth after a five year journey to an asteroid containing the remnants of his planet, Krypton. Crash landing on the Kent farm, his mom (Eva Marie Saint) welcomes him back with open arms. Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) has also been busy during the last five years; romancing the rich elderly woman who helped him get out of prison, he gets her to sign over her fortune, just as she dies, despite the loud protests of her family. Using the old woman's yacht, Lex, Kitty (Parker Posey) and his henchmen travel to the Fortress of Solitude where Lex wants to learn more about crystals. Returning to Metropolis, ready to save the planet, Clark Kent learns a lot has changed at the Daily Planet as well. Perry White (Frank Langella) has brought in his nephew Richard (James Marsden) to help run the paper. Lois and Richard have been seeing each other and have a small son, Jason (Tristan Lake Lebeau). Clark learns Lois has been awarded the Pulitzer Prize for an article entitled ""Why The World Doesn't Need Superman?"" But where is Lois (Kate Bosworth)? She is covering a new shuttle launch, riding the 747 which will launch the spacecraft. At that moment, Lex decides to experiment with a small shaving from one of the crystals he brought back from the Fortress of Solitude, releasing a burst of power and providing Superman with the perfect opportunity to reenter the public eye.Directed by Bryan Singer (""The Usual Suspects"", ""X-Men""), ""Superman Returns"" is a well-produced film with a lot of baggage.Frankly, I was expecting a better film from the director who brought us two great movies. This appears to be an example of a director who finally has the opportunity to direct his dream project and becomes so wrapped up in the details, they throw story and character development out the window, everything that made their previous films so good. No one even seems to think to ask where Kent/ Superman has been during the last five years, everyone just seems to except it. There are brief allusions to the reason for the trip during his reunion with his mom, but these scenes only make him seem a little heartless. How could he leave his mom, an elderly widow, alone for five years? She seems to accept this, so we go along with it. Really, the only person who seems to have taken the absence poorly is Lois Lane. Her relationship with Richard is more of a convenience. She was suddenly left alone and needed someone to confide in, so she started dating Richard. Yet, in five years, they have never married so where does their relationship stand? She doesn't seem to be in love with Richard, but because she has a son, she sticks with him. It is up to Singer to answer these questions and make these relationships interesting and believable, but he doesn't do that. Surely, they could have spent another couple of million to polish the screenplay a little more before going into production? With a reported budget of $200 million, what's another $2 million?A side note: the addition of Richard (James Marsden) is a blatant attempt to help this role skew younger. In the sequels (Provided there are any. I don't see this film generating a lot of profit.) I'm sure Perry (Frank Langella) will be retired, vacationing or deceased and his younger, more attractive nephew will take over. But the character is so bland; it won't add anything except a pretty face. Richard needs a dark side, an alter ego, along the lines of James Franco's character in the ""Spiderman"" series.Brandon Routh is the spitting image of Superman. But he is the spitting image of our recollection of Christopher Reeve's portrayal of the character. The two actors bear a remarkable resemblance. And that isn't a good thing, because it points to many deficiencies in the portrayal. Reeve had a goofy, sort of everyman quality which made the role of Clark Kent live. As Superman, he had the physique and good looks to pull that off as well. Routh certainly has all of that, but his remarkable resemblance to Reeve causes us to make comparisons we shouldn't have to make. Routh looks like a younger version of the deceased Reeve and his presence reminds us of the other actor's passing.Pushing that aside for the moment, is Routh any good? Because of the remarkable resemblance, it is all but impossible not to compare them. He has a certain goofy quality which works well as Kent. But it doesn't seem as natural as his predecessor. At one point, his glasses slip down his nose, threatening to reveal his identity as Superman. He quickly pushes them back. Reeve did the exact same thing, but he seemed more flustered, more concerned and more real in a comic book, goofy kind of way.As Superman, Routh certainly has the looks and physique to make him a super hero, but he doesn't do much with the character. As the Man of Steel, he almost never speaks and very little seems to cause him any significant problems.Kate Bosworth is a complete void in the role of Lois Lane. She never seems able to build any chemistry with Kent, Superman or Richard. In her one extended sequence with the little boy playing her son, she seems to regard him as an obligation and little else.When Kent returns to the Daily Planet, Bosworth's Lane seems to regard him as more of nuisance. Yes, Margot Kidder did the same thing, but she also managed to convey that there was the hint of a romantic interest there. Bosworth never seems to be even remotely interested in Richard (Marsden). It's maddening to see a performance like this. Didn't the director notice that Bosworth was unable to create any chemistry with either of her leading men? I would think it would be unavoidable, but perhaps he felt this was the best he was going to get.Perhaps the only actress who could've done a worse job is Kate Beckinsale. Bosworth seems to be a living computer generated image, all looks and no feeling, merely going through the motions in service of the story. Character? What character?Spacey owes a lot to the work of Gene Hackman, who played the role in the first series of films. As Lex Luthor, he has the swagger, the confidence and the mad scheme, but the scheme doesn't appear to have been fully plotted, Luthor doesn't actually know what the extent of his plan will be. This is not a good development, because it makes him seem less threatening. Even with all of the comical moments, the interactions with the Otis (Ned Beatty) and Miss Teschmacher (Valerie Perrine), Hackman's Luthor always seemed threatening. He knew the warhead would destroy the West Coast and give him control of a large piece of `beachfront property'. Because he didn't care where the second warhead landed, his Luthor became even more diabolical. Spacey's Luthor doesn't know the full extent of what he is doing and too much of it takes him by surprise. Therefore, he seems more like comic relief. The one moment of threat comes late in the film, when Superman and Luthor finally meet on the little continent the villain has just created. Spacey's Luthor simply doesn't show both traits well; he has some amusing moments, but he never really appears threatening.It also doesn't help that he is surrounded by the most forgettable crew of henchmen to appear in a film in some time. Honestly, I can't remember anyone's name except for Parker Posey's character and that is because I recognize the actress. As Kitty, Posey does an OK job of demonstrating her continued dismay with Lex, but she never fully develops as a character. Why is she with Luthor? Why does she start to cry when she learns of Luthor's plan? It is maddening that these questions arise. All of this should have been answered. Singer has let us down.So what's good about ""Superman Returns""? They use the familiar ""Superman"" theme composed by John Williams during the familiar credits sequence.Okay. There is more. That's giving the film too little credit.The film is well-designed and executed. Every frame of the film looks like it exists in the real world, even when Superman is trying to save a 747 plummeting to earth or when Lex and his henchman are cavorting over a new landmass. The technicians on the film went to great pains to make the Kent Farm look realistic, to recreate the Daily Planet building, to invest the old woman's home with a creepy opulence and to build a yacht fit for a lunatic. All of these beautifully designed locations help to make the world of Superman more believable. But without believable characters, it merely seems like window dressing.There are also a few great action sequences. The first is the scene with the 747. As soon as we see Lois Lane among the press corps riding the 747, we know something bad will happen. Then, when they reveal a Space Shuttle will be launched from the top of the jet, we begin to get the idea. Luthor's experiments cause a power failure and threaten everyone on the plane. The sequence is terrific. From the moment, the shuttle ignites while malfunctioning and still attached to the plane and the press corps on the plane begin to travel at supersonic speed, to the moment Superman helps the plane come to a safe landing in the middle of a baseball diamond, everything looks real and scary and life threatening.Unfortunately, this is the moment we are reintroduced to Lois Lane. And as she gets tossed around the cabin of the 747, we are there with her, but we don't really care about the threat to her life. Why? Because we don't care for this character yet. We haven't been with her long enough or learned anything new to make us care. This robs the sequence of a significant amount of suspense. Because one of the main characters is involved in the scene isn't enough, we have to know about that person, care about them, worry about their safety.The other interesting scene involves Luthor's new continent. Watching the land mass grow, many of the consequences of this action pose a threat to innocent people in Metropolis and Superman has to rush off and correct a number of life threatening problems. It is a fun sequence, simply because we watch the Man of Steel solving many problems, quickly, neatly. These two sequences come the closest to creating the roller coaster type moments you would expect many times in a film running 2 hours and 40 minutes.I do recommend ""Superman Returns"", but just barely. All of the great production design makes the film a feast for the eyes, too bad the actors are almost universally wrong, bad or uninteresting.",3,"Something Old, Something New, Something Tired

1023776,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B000J10EQU,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[5, 6]","...I'm still waiting for Superman. Bryan Singer brings his gee-wizardry to the mothballed Superman series and then utterly fails to add anything new. In fact, he barely can disguise the fact that he has - in essence - remade the first Christopher Reeves' ""Superman"" with a time-line update or two. Brandon Routh (who seemed to get the part because of his uncanny resemblance to Reeves) returns to Earth after a futile five year search for the remnants of Krypton. He discovers that Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth, looking far too young for the part) has moved on, got a fiance and had a son. She even kissed Superman off with a Pulitzer Prize editorial called ""Why The World Doesn't Need Superman.""And then there's Lex Luthor. Using the five years that Superman has vanished to bilk an aging billionairess of all her money, he is back to plotting Lutherland again. I was all but waiting for the terrific Parker Posey to blubber ""But Lex, my mother lives in Hackensack"" as Luther (a malevolent and humorless Kevin Spacey) describes how millions, no, BILLIONS will die as he floods the continent.It's all pretty obvious where this is headed, no? If you're old enough to remember seeing the first Christopher Reeves version, then little of this will surprise you. Everyone plays their parts well (with the exception of Bosworth as Lane) and some of the minor casting is excellent (Frank Langella and Eva Marie Saint in particular). The crashing jet is a great opening for the film and does get ""Superman Returns"" off to a flying start, but there is just too much retread here to raise this above average. Here's hoping Singer, who has proven himself to be a far better movie-maker than this, gets a crack at the sequel. Should he manage that, I am hoping he can move past the cliches and deliver a Superman that is as original and as vibrant as the 70's movies he so obviously admires.Another nice touch - the dedication to Christopher and Dana Reeves.Incidentally, this DVD has NO extras. Not even a trailer or previews. Nada, nutting.

1023778,A3P1A63Q8L32C5,B000J10EQU,T. Lobascio,"[2, 6]","Does Superman Returns Soar?Sort Of...Superman-The Movie was the first feature film to treat a comic book super-hero seriously, while still managing to be lots of fun in the process. It's stayed with me since the first time I saw it at the age of 10.When director Bryan Singer announced that SR would use elements from the first 2 Superman features as a springboard for the new movie, I was both excited and intrigued at the same time...Following a 5 year absence in search of his home world of Krypton, the Man of Steel (Brandon Routh) comes back to Earth. While arch-enemy Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) plots to create a new continent for the ultimate land grab, vowing to render our hero powerless once and for all. Superman also faces the heartbreaking realization that the woman he loves, Lois Lane, (Kate Bosworth) has moved on with her life. Superman's return means that he must somehow come to grips with that reality, while finding his place in the world that has learned to live without him.For all intents and purposes, the film is as much a remake of the '78 film, as it is a sequel. Singer pays homage and then some---Some tips of the hat are obvious, like the flying credit sequence that opens the movie, while others only true devotees of the Donner flick would appreciate. WARNING GEEK-OUT ALERT The Daily Planet background employees, for instance, share the same names as their 1978 counterpartsSinger has made an epic film for sure, and it has lots of stuff that works--The shuttle rescue is a breathtaking sequence of film making. It was at that moment that Routh made me believe that he could do a solid job as the super blue boy scout. Having said that, I still got the impression that he is more comfortable as alter ego Clark Kent, than supes. I have no problem with Bosworth as an actress here but she still looks a bit too young for the role She also lacks Lois's trademark sass making it difficult to believe her as the star reporter. Spacey as Luthor is a hybrid of the Gene Hackman version who had an ""affinity for beach front property"" and the darker Lex from the modern day comics...Poor James Karen and Kal Penn. They are totally wasted here, with probably one line of dialogue each, in the movie... Parker Posey as Luthor's gal Kitty fares slightly better--but not by much. I loved the psuedo- recreation of the cover from Action Comics #1. Sooo cool!!! Seeing Jack Larson and Noel Neill from TV's The Adventures of Superman series in cameo roles is also a real kick of nostalgia.The major issues I have with the movie start and end with the bloated screenplay by Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris. They try to cram so much into the story that the climax seemed like it was rushed while the mid section lumbered along. Even at 2 hours and 23 minutes the original never plodded like this one does at times. Big mistake; a comic book film should never feel like its ""plodding"" along.If we are to believe that the events of SR follow those depicted in Superman II than Superman's line to the President, in that film--""I'll never let you down again"" is meaningless--Because he lets everyone down by leaving without an explanation. I find it hard to belive he would do that...And there's more... The Kid--The fact that Supes was a mortal when he slept with Lois in II, means any offspring would be human, no?...and the famous memory wipe smooch means Lois would have had no knowledge of having slept with our hero in the first place. The end of the movie hints otherwise... Those aspects are forgotten by Singer and Co. entirely and left dangling--waiting to be answered. As disciples to Donner's vision--I expected those plot points to be adressed here and now and not for the sequel... All glossed over in favor of seeing our hero eavesdrop on Lois and new beau Richard White (James Marsden, who finally has a decent part in a comic book flick) more than once.

1023781,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B000J10EQU,Tom Benton,"[4, 7]","In the realm of superhero films, Richard Donner's SUPERMAN is legendary.  As far as general filmmaking goes, it's a classic.  It is single-handedly responsible for the superhero film.  To this day, it ranks as one of the very finest superhero films ever made, by which all others shall be measured.  Wisely, director Bryan Singer opted not to remake Donner's epic masterpiece.  Instead, he set writers Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris to work crafting a sort of sequel to SUPERMAN II, ignoring the last two sequels (which had never been too popular with audiences or fans).  The result is SUPERMAN RETURNS.At the start of the film, a brief blip explains that a group of scientists discovered the remains of the destroyed planet Krypton - which is, of course, Superman's homeworld.  The Man of Steel left his adopted planet behind and set out to investigate these remains, hoping to find one of his own kind.  Five years later, Superman - played by Brandon Routh - returns.  To his shock, things have changed - a lot.  For one thing, his nemesis Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) has been released from prison.  Also, without Superman, the world's crime rate has gone way up.  The biggest shock of all - Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) is married, and has a young son!I remember that back when McG was helming this film, I was certain that it would fail.  McG, the man who brought us CHARLIE'S ANGELS and CHARLIE'S ANGELS: FULL THROTTLE, directing a Superman movie?  Please, no!  Though I felt a little better when McG left and Brett Ratner signed on, I was still nervous.  Then, thank the Gods, Bryan Singer - the man behind THE USUAL SUSPECTS and the comic book masterpieces X-MEN and X2 - signed on.  I breathed a long, heavy sigh of relief.  The project, I felt, was in good hands.Was I wrong?  No.  Not at all.Singer knows what to do and when to do it.  He has an eye for spectacular, thrilling visuals, but can also get great performances from his cast.  The action sequences in SUPERMAN RETURNS are some of the most exciting ever filmed.  That's not to say that this is some cheap action flick.  Hardly!  This film is just as moving and emotional as it is thrilling.  The real story of the Superman comics is the love triangle between Superman, Lois Lane, and Clark Kent.  Bryan Singer realizes this, and makes use of it.  Singer, however, sets Clark off to the side and focuses more on the relationship between Lois and Superman - which has become far more complicated now that Lois is married, and, as Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) points out, ""a mommy.""One of the big worries of every Superman fan was the casting of Superman himself.  Christopher Reeve, whose portrayal of the Man of Steel is now legendary, was perfect; to countless people, he WAS Superman.  How could anyone hope to fill his shoes?  Wisely, Bryan Singer decided to cast an unknown, just as Richard Donner had done when he made SUPERMAN.  That unknown was Brandon Routh.  And Brandon Routh is amazing.  He is very nearly, maybe even as good as the dear Mr. Reeve.  His performance resembles Reeve's, and yet Routh manages to bring his own touch to the character.  He is truly to be commended for his portrayal of the Man of Steel.  Wonderful.Then there's Lex Luthor.Possibly the most famous comic book villain, and undoubtedly one of the most popular villains in history, Lex Luthor is Superman's scheming, brilliant nemesis.  In the 1978-1987 series, he was portrayed by Gene Hackman.  Hackman's portrayal was good, very good, but he seemed a little too jokey and cowardly to me.  Where was the sinister, evil Lex Luthor of the Superman comics?  As I had suspected he would, the magnificent Kevin Spacey brings to life the maniacal, spiteful Lex Luthor of the comic books.  This Lex does not hide beneath the ground, plotting Superman's defeat while suffering his bumbling sidekicks.  Spacey's Lex DOES plot Superman's demise, but he does so with pure hatred, off to the side, surrounded by violent thugs, and when Luthor finally confronts Superman, he stands there and stares the Man of Steel right in the eye.  You can feel the hatred seeping from Lex Luthor, and from Mr. Spacey.I feel that Ms. Bosworth is getting some harsh and undeserved criticism from people.  Her Lois Lane is angrier than Margot Kidder's, but she has reason to be.  How could Superman, Earth's savior, just take off and leave Earth's people for five years?  I think that Bosworth is a terrific Lois, and she performs very well with Routh.The supporting cast includes James Marsden, who also appeared in Singer's X-MEN movies, as Richard White, Lois' fiance.  Marsden's character clearly feels that he is standing in Superman's shadow, but he never comes across as being stuck-up or a jerk; rather, we sympathize with him.  Frank Langella plays Perry White, the clever editor-in-chief of the Daily Planet.  Langella is great, better than Jackie Cooper was in the original Superman movies.  The lovely Parker Posey provides much of the comic relief, replacing Valerie Perrine as Lex Luthor's female accomplice.  Sam Huntington is very funny as young photographer Jimmy Olsen.  Eva Marie Saint appears in the film briefly as Clark's mother.  Interestingly, Saint made her big-screen debut in 1954's ON THE WATERFRONT, opposite Marlon Brando.  Through footage from Richard Donner's SUPERMAN, and unused footage from that film and SUPERMAN II, Brando returns as Jor-El.  It is wonderful to hear his soothing voice again as Superman's wise father.  Also, Jack Larson and Noel Neill, who portrayed Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane in the 1950s SUPERMAN TV series, have fun cameos.One of the things which troubled me during the making of the movie was the music.  John Williams' music for the original series was absolutely flawless, perfect, stupendous, magnificent - one of the greatest film scores of all time.  I was familiar with John Ottman's work through THE USUAL SUSPECTS and the X-MEN movies, but that didn't really give me much of an idea what his music for SUPERMAN RETURNS would be like.  I needn't have worried - as Ottman himself says in the liner notes for the soundtrack CD, he was a big fan of Williams' score.  What Ottman has composed is a score that is at once majestic, powerful, heart-pounding, and beautiful.  At the same time, he lets Williams' themes soar when they should.  It's truly a delight.  Should Mr. Williams ever listen to it, I'm sure he would be proud.Though the plot of SUPERMAN RETURNS is not the most brilliant ever conceived, the rest of the film more than makes up for it.  It is, quite simply, one of the finest superhero movies ever made.  It's a delightful, soaring, romantic adventure that is as charming as any film I've ever seen.  The cast, the script, the directing, the effects, it's all wonderful.The tagline for the 1978 epic famously proclaimed ""You'll Believe A Man Can Fly!"".  After seeing SUPERMAN RETURNS, I believe once more that a man can fly, and I believe that under the control of Bryan Singer, this new series will soar as well.  I am proud to proclaim that Superman, the Man of Steel, Krypton's last son and Earth's saviour, has most certainly returned.",5,Superman returns,1152144000,"07 6, 2006",2006,7144,"['realm',

1023782,A2YKADCJME4FSW,B000J10EQU,Tom Birkenstock,"[0, 0]","At long last it's here.  After a decade of studio development through flightless incarnations, Superman wrasslin' polar bears, and a black suit, the Last Son of Krypton has finally made it into theaters. Of course, nothing could have stopped The Man of Steel. I'm sure that after this long of a wait most people expect nothing less than the second coming from Superman Returns. With all of the Christ imagery in the new film, it seems that the filmmakers were more than happy to oblige.However, while there are more than a few allusions to Christ in Superman Returns, I believe the film is actually dealing with the broader theme of Joseph Campbell's A Hero with a Thousand Faces. Much of Campbell's book deals with what he calls the ""monomyth,"" which is a single mythic structure that can be juxtaposed on just about any myth from any culture. This monomyth is supposed to be hardwired into us through Jungian psychology.Campbell then goes on to analyze the themes found in the monomyth. One of the reoccurring themes of the monomyth is the return home. A hero must venture into an outer mystical world (ex: Luke Skywalker leaving Tatooine and Frodo leaving The Shire) on some kind of journey. However, eventually the hero will return to his home with the skills he has learned abroad and give his homeland a ""boon"" (ex: Luke Skywalker returning to Tatooine and destroying Jabba the Hut and Frodo and his friends saving The Shire during the Battle of Bywater [not shown in the movie]). This boon is supposed to reinvigorate the once decaying society.Predictably, Superman Returns deals heavily with the idea of Campbell's return. One of the revelations of A Hero with a Thousand Faces is that although the mythic hero is spoken of in terms of the ideal man, the mythic hero is really just a representation of each person's true potential. The hero is really just a stand in for all of us at our greatest. This is what Superman Returns understands. There's a great bit of dialogue from Marlon Brando where he says something to the affect: ""They can be a great people Jor-El. They wish to be. They only need someone to show them the way."" (Warning: superspoilers below). Furthermore, Superman is not the only hero in this film. Lois Lane's fianc&eacute;, Richard White, rushes to the aid of his love interest and their son (?).  (On a side note, it's nice to have a film that makes the other guy a decent human being. It seems like every film makes the ""other guy"" out to be some jerk. This puzzles me, because who has sympathy for a girl who's going to marry a jerk?) Superman himself needs heroes to come to his own rescue. They come in the form of Lois herself and, later, the police officers and doctors who bring him to the hospital and help him recover. The hospital part in the movie is genius because it expands the idea of a hero beyond the guy in tights to every one of us. The ""boon"" in Superman Returns ends up being an example that's not beyond the stars, but firmly within our reach.There are other themes in the film that bear discussion (the new family dynamics for example). There are also little ways I could nitpick the film (the Christ imagery is a little heavy handed, and weren't Siegel and Shuster Jewish anyways?), but that's not a whole lot of fun. While not perfect, Superman Returns delivers some great action, drama, and a pinch of intellectual ideas, but, most importantly, it also leaves the viewer anticipating a sequel.

This year's remake was a dull remake that brought no new ideas.Now look at Bryan Singer's revival of Superman.  It's supposed to pick up five years after Superman II, which by the way, much of it was shot by Donner until the film's producers clashed with him, and hired Richard Lester to finish the rest.But Singer simply doesn't catch the joy, wonderment and innocence of the first two movies.Brandon Routh is well cast as Superman, and Parker Posey steals her scenes as Lex Luthor's sidekick, but Kate Bosworth and Kevin Spacey really bring this movie down. Bosworth is just sour as Lois Lane, bringing none of the humour or sexiness that Margot Kidder did.  Perhaps Rachel McAdams would have been a better choice.  And then there's Kevin Spacey.  I have to say he is one of the most overrated actors in Hollywood.  He's too over the top, snarky, and as Lex Luthor, he's really dull.  It doesn't help that the story is uninteresting and nonsensical - something about Lex trying to create a new world or some such nonsense.Then there's the subplot of Superman supposedly having taken off for five years to find traces of his home plot.  But it's hard to believe that Superman would leave in the first place, so we never buy the story in the first place.Singer simply doesn't pull these unbelievable stories together, and his miscasting seriously hurts the film.

One day last year i saw part of this movie on FX in standard definition, and it was quite well done, enthralling to say the least. So when i was going through the list of HD DVDs for sale (for dirt cheap), i noticed this jewel of a bargain. HD DVD format combo with a DVD on the flip side is great if u don't have the super rare optical drive or Toshiba player, and if u have the HD DVD player like me then prepared to be wowed with 1080p Full HD picture, 5.1 dolby TRUE HD surround sound, 10 deleted scenes, featurettes and joke takes. This is one of the best examples of HD DVD i've seen since King Kong!Visual effects are state of the art, beginning with the supernova of Krypton's sun, and later with the Superman hero effects. By far the best superhero movie i have ever seen, and i don't even care.

1023792,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000J10EQU,Trevor Willsmer,"[3, 3]","It would be tempting to dismiss Superman Returns with a cursory he shouldn't have bothered. Certainly for all the noble intentions it's the most misconceived blockbuster in years, at times misjudging its audience more than any mega-budget film since Speed 2. On paper it sounds so promising - ignoring the last two Superman films and following on from Superman II as if they never happened, throwing Marlon Brando back in the mix via archive footage and bringing the Man of Steel back to Earth after an absence of several years during which people have begun to question whether they even need him anymore. And after Bryan Singer's success with the first two X-Men films, he'd seem the perfect director. Yet the end result is one of the most disappointingly dull and relentlessly glum movies of the century, and certainly one of the grottiest looking major studio films ever. It's at once one of those films that manages to look both expensive and cheap. You can see where money has been spent, but it never really counts. If anything it looks like a busted, bloated miniseries, all buildup but precious little payoff. What we get instead is endless brooding.Yet the relentlessly oppressive look of the film is merely a symptom of a far greater malaise. Where Donner mixed sorrow with joy and exuberance, Singer just gives us naval gazing as his Superman spends far more of the movie brooding, brooding and then brooding some more, not even finding any satisfaction in the few feats of heroism he performs. Indeed, they should have changed the tagline to 'You'll believe a man can brood' as he mopes his way through much of the agonisingly long 154 very long minutes. He hardly even flies - he just hovers around wallowing in wistful self-pity forever before we finally get half an hour of decent action before its back to the misery (albeit somewhat more effective than the dreary first half).The film is often genuinely monotonous in the dictionary sense of the word. There's no sense of pace or narrative economy, no joy of discovery, no eagerness to see what happens next, just an unexciting trudge through the superhero's angst as he endlessly hovers around. Worse, this is a film with no sense of wonder at all.Where the Donner films worked was their ability to juggle loss, emotion, a sense of wonder and joy and exuberance - with Reeve you got the impression that Superman enjoyed using his powers to do good, but here it's nothing but a cross to bear in a series of even-more-bleedin'-obvious-than-The-Passion-of-the-Christ metaphors. Look, there's Supes being crucified; look, there's Supes being scourged; and look - on the Third day the tomb is empty and he has risen!Yet for all the time spent on would-be character building scenes, even by the half hour point we know surprisingly little and care less about the characters, so that when Superman finally goes into action in a well-conceived but strangely unexciting shuttle rescue it carries no real weight. Only Kevin Spacey seems to be bringing anything to the party, his Lex Luthor dominating the film far more than should be good for it as he sets about his latest real estate scam at great length. On the side of good, Brandon Routh fares better as Clark Kent than as Superman, his weak voice combining with a poor sound mix to make the Man of Steel sound distinctly wimpier than the mild-mannered reporter. Kate Bosworth does her best with Lois Lane, but the character goes through the film with such a huge chip on her shoulder it's impossible to warm to her despite her best efforts. Hell, you know a film's in trouble when James Marsden makes the most impression!And it all looks so grotty all the time, with the limitations of the video photography robbing even close-ups of detail (some shots of Superman's face look more like a Final Fantasy computer simulation than a real person), limiting the color scheme (Superman's costume usually looks turquoise or green here) and seemingly limiting the action to clumsy tight shots that limit the film's scale. Even basic no-brainer shots are simply botched - hard to believe but even the would-be iconic shot of Clark ripping off his shirt to reveal - well, just a little bit of blue vest actually - flops because the shot misses the iconic `S' logo entirely as if the film was framed for fullframe TV instead of widescreen.Nor are the well-intentioned nods to the Donner films successful. The Brando footage, after the first scene, seem more gimmick than anything else, with lines thrown in almost at random to no effect whatsoever. It even rehashes huge chunks of other characters' dialogue from the first film, showing up just how short some of the players fall (Routh seems almost apologetic when delivering the `flying is still statistically speaking the safest way to travel' bit while Parker Posey does her best with Valerie Perrine's cast-off wisecracks).Although they're talking about adding more action for the proposed sequel, that's really not the solution - the 1978 film probably had less action than this, but it counted because we were involved with and liked the characters: you wanted him to rescue Lois from the helicopter, whereas this time round you couldn't care less if the surly cow burned up in the shuttle scene or not (as an introduction to her as well it's incredibly poor). What this needs is characters we like and can root for, not bigger set pieces. As it stands, Hell, even Fantastic Four was a more successful superhero flick than this. It's as if someone decided to film Lois Lane's editorial `Why the World Doesn't Need Superman.' Looks like Supe's fatal flaw isn't Kryptonite, it's Bryan Singer. Still, it could have been worse: it could have been Brett Ratner...The extras on the 2-disc set are good and at least highlight the sincere intentions behind this misfire but it's hard to muster up the enthusiasm to watch them throughout after seeing the film, especially since the expensive Krypton prolog is NOT included in the deleted scenes, being held back for a future special edition in what seems a particularly cynically commercial move. The transfer of the feature is okay, but the limitations of the original digital photography are often very apparent, meaning that it frequently looks worse than the first two films made more than a quarter of a century ago!",2,You'll believe a man can brood,1174348800,"03 20, 2007",2007,6323,"['would', 'be', 'tempting', 'dismiss', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'cursory', 'should', ""n't"", 'have',

1023793,A1FO24PIXHM3SG,B000J10EQU,T. RHEAULT,"[3, 3]","Oh my goodness, I cannot believe how this movie gets a bad rap despite the fact that it is, in my humble opinion, a quality action/superhero movie.  Obviously if you dislike Superman movies or action/superhero movies in general, you are probably not going to be reading this review anyway.  I am aiming this review towards people who like this genre but have been deterred from renting/buying this movie because- allegedly- this movie is a travesty of epic proportions.I will try to avoid spoilers whenever possible, but in short this movie is essentially a sequel toSuperman: The MovieandSuperman II; Superman has returned to Earth after being gone for 5 years searching for the remains of his home planet.  Lois Lane has moved on with her life and has a boyfriend and a son, and meanwhile Lex Luthor has been released from prison and has a new scheme to make a fortune on real estate.Director Bryan Singer is clearly in love with the style and presentation that Richard Donner originated in Superman 1 and Superman 2 (at least before Donner was fired by the producers on the second film).  We get the classic John Williams soundtrack, an outstanding opening credits sequence that pays homage to the credits sequences of the first two movies, as well as nods to memorable scenes and lines of dialogues from the first two films.  The movie features excellent effects (you will believe again that a man can fly!), a decent story that builds upon the themes of the first two movies, some genuine tension and jeopardy for our hero at the end, and an uplifting ending that opened the door for future sequels.So far, so good, right?  Well, let's go over the chief complaints that have been leveled against the film:1. *The movie has no action*  This is a curious criticism to make for a movie that features the following (minor spoilers): Superman saving a jetliner (and Lois Lane) from crashing, Superman stopping an armed robber armed with a machine gun, Superman saving Metropolis from natural disasters while using many of his superpowers (heat vision, super strength, freeze breath, and super speed/flying), Superman lifting an ocean liner to save Lois/her boyfriend/her son, Superman lifting an entire continent - a continent containing Kryptonite no less!- to save billions of lives.Oh wait, I forgot.  Superman doesn't fight anyone or trade punches with a supervillain.  Please.  Does this really constitute a valid complaint against the movie?  Does every superhero movie we make have to pander to the 10-18 year old male demographic?The original Superman movie is widely accepted as a classic, and Superman does not fight anyone in that movie.  Watching a superhero overcome over obstacles should be as entertaining as watching him punch out a supervillain.2. *The movie has bad acting*  Substantial criticism has been directed towards Brandon Routh as Superman and Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane.  First, Routh makes an excellent Superman.  His resemblance to the late, great Christopher Reeve is well documented, but Routh gives a complicated performance as both Superman and Clark Kent that comes across as much more than a Reeve caricature.The Bosworth criticisms have some merit to them.  Bosworth is an attractive, talented young actress, but it is a bit of a stretch to accept her as a spunky go-get-`em reporter.  To be sure, the script could have given Bosworth more to work with, but I think the main problem is that she simply looks too young (especially since this movie is supposed to come afterSuperman II, which featured a Lois Lane that looked to be in her early 30s).  Bosworth's age could have been a potential asset if the movie had led to more sequels, but that ended up being a nonissue with a reboot due to come out next year from Director Zack Snyder.A special note of praise must be directed to the always-excellent Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor.  Spacey's performance is clearly inspired by Gene Hackman's classic portrayal of Luthor, but Spacey makes the role as his own, mixing Hackman's comedic take with a sinister edge that is delicious to watch.3. *The movie's plot was too derivative of the original Superman movie*  Some have criticized the movies storyline- particularly Lex Luthor's villainous scheme- as being too similar to the original Superman movie.  While this movie is indeed quite similar to the first one (which I am certain was entirely intentional on Bryan Singer's part), it is hardly the remake that some have made it out to be.In particular, Lex Luthor's scheme makes perfect sense.  Again, this movie is a sequel to Superman 2, and in Superman 2 Lex discovers the Fortress of Solitude and the Kryptonian crystals contained within.  Once he is released from prison, does it not make complete sense that he would travel back to the Fortress to exploit the advanced technology contained there?(Minor spoiler) One can criticize that the landmass that Luthor creates with the Kryptonian crystal would be uninhabitable and therefore useless for him to sell, but any supervillain scheme in a movie like this one is going to have holes and flaws.4. *Gasp! Superman has an illegitimate child!  Heresy!*  Some have been offended by the idea of Superman having a son with Lois Lane (which apparently was a result of their intimate encounter in Superman 2), with the son being born while Superman was away from Earth.Haven't we accepted the idea of other iconic heroes having children while unmarried- for example, Captain/Admiral Kirk in Star Trek II, and Indiana Jones in ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"".Now, I think one can certainly criticize the timing of giving Superman a child.  ""Superman Returns"" was designed to re-introduce the character after nearly 20 years of not being on movie screens.  It would have made more sense to have Superman and Lois get married in a future sequel (an idea that has already happened in the comics, the ""Lois and Clark"" t.v. series, and even the recent ""Smallville"" series), and then have a son.  Alan Moore's excellentSuperman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?story - which ended the Silver Age Superman stories- featured a poignant scene at the end involving Superman's son that would have played well in a ""final"" Superman movie (had Bryan Singer been allowed to direct a series of Superman movies).In summary, Bryan Singer gave us a good- but not quite great- Superman movie.  It is a real shame that he was not allowed to make a sequel.  In 2002 Director Sam Raimi gave us a good but not quite greatSpider-Manmovie, and then followed up in 2004 with one of the greatest (and I would argue *the* greatest) superhero movies inSpider-Man 2.  I think a Singer Superman sequel could have followed that pattern and given us a truly epic Superman movie on par with the first two films.  Singer had stated that he planned to go in the direction of ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"" with a second movie, so it likely would have been a movie that featured Superman going toe-to-toe with a supervillain, a la Superman 2.  (Hopefully Singer will give us some details on what he intended to do with his Superman sequel while promoting the new X-Men film.)Instead, we will be getting a reboot next year from Zack Snyder that will feature General Zod as the main villain, and is rumored to have Clark Kent traveling the world before deciding to don the Superman costume.  At least ""Superman Returns"" had Superman already *being* Superman right from the start, but hey, even if the Snyder film spends 3/4 of the movie with Clark debating whether to actually be Superman, all will be forgiven if the last 1/4 of the movie features a Superman-Zod slugfest with Snyder's trademark slo-mo action and plenty of gore/blood, right?If that happens, Bryan Singer's intelligent, emotional film may finally get some well-deserved respect after all.",4,"Underrated, Quality Superman Epic",1306627200,"05 29, 2011",2011,7811,"['Oh', 'goodness', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'how',

In the film, Superman (Brandon Routh) left Earth five years ago when astronomers discovered the remains of his home planet of Krypton.  Having to be certain that there was nothing left there, Superman left on an odyssey across the universe.  In the meantime, life on Earth went on.  Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) was tired of waiting and became disillusioned and wrote an editorial entitled ""Why the World Doesn't Need Superman"" which finally netted her a Pulitzer.  She also birthed a son and became engaged to Perry White's nephew (James Marsden).  Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) went to jail and after years of good behavior was released early and immediately began planning his next diabolical plan.  All the while, Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) kept taking pictures.  As for the rest of the planet, the Average Joes struggled to live in a world that increasingly became more violent, turbulent, and destructive.Having been released from prison, Lex Luthor befriends an extremely wealthy heiress and on her deathbed has her sign a will that leaves her entire fortune to him.  Using his newly acquired wealth, Luthor travels with his new squeeze, Kitty Kowalski (Parker Posey), to Superman's hideout, The Fortress of Solitude.  Once there, he ease drops on some of the boy in blue's personal tapes from his Dad and steals some of the crystals.  Later he breaks into a museum and steals some kryptonite.  Meanwhile, Lois is having an emotional breakdown as she tries to figure out her life now that Superman has returned.  As for Clark Kent, he's busy trying to fit back into work at the Planet after having been gone for a five-year world tour and Superman is out saving the world: everything from stopping a space shuttle from crashing to rescuing a stray animal from a tree.  Everything seems to go according to Lex Luthor's plans.Superman has always been one of my favorite superheroes and there's not a whole lot that one can complain about in SUPERMAN RETURNS.  It is true that in style and structure, SUPERMAN RETURNS closely follows in the footsteps of SUPERMAN and SUPERMAN II while completely ignoring SUPERMAN III and SUPERMAN IV.  There are scenes in the movie that are very similar to scenes in SUPERMAN, several lines are copied directly from that movie, and Luthor's motivation is the same as the first film, too.  Nevertheless, with some solid acting from most of the cast (Routh doesn't get an opportunity to do much of his own acting--most of the time he's re-enacting Reeve's performance), state of the art special effects, and a great story, director Bryan Singer does an excellent job of keeping the golden boy tied to his roots, but allowing him to enter the 21st Century.

First of all, I am old enough that I watched the original Superman TV series with George Reeve and used to collect the comic books!  I loved the first two Superman movies with Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder.  He was just terrific as Superman and she did well with what she was given for Lois Lane.Brandon Routh seems to be doing a Christopher Reeve impersonation especially when he is in his Clark Kent persona.  However, as Superman -- not super at all.  And by the way, what were the director/producer thinking having that dangling curl over his forehead as Superman?  Sheesh, it looks stupid!!  I agree also with other reviewers that his costume was too burgundy instead of red (check the comic books, guys) and the small ""S"" up too high on his chest looked ridiculous!!  I liked much of the plot and acting but really felt that Brandon Routh should have put his OWN imprint on Superman and having Lois Lane a single mom, engaged and still acting loopy about Superman was just not believable.While Smallville has taken many, many liberties with the Superman as a teen and now college man, at least when you watch Tom Welling as Clark Kent/Superman he is very believable.  Michael Rosenbaum as Lex Luthor with John Glover as his dad, Lionel Luthor, are also incredible actors.Not sure why (maybe he is under contract to Warner Bros.) Tom Welling wasn't given a chance at Superman Returns but maybe next time they should try him!!  He is only 1 year older than Brandon Routh and appears from other movies (Cheaper by the Dozen 1 & 2) in good shape.Kate Bostwick did a nice job with a very unhelpful script.  I think much of her dialogue was not very realistic for an ace reporter!All in all, fun to watch but not a thrill and much lacking.  Rent it don't buy it.",3,and maybe a half for effort!

There appear to have been good intentions, but they remained only intentions.This review contains only mild spoilers.  If you don't want spoilers, probably you should not worry, as much of the plot is completely predictable.  Superman Returns starts promisingly but soon degenerates into lost opportunities.Superman has been gone for five years because he thought Krypton might have survived.  It did not.  Why it took him five years to return to earth is never explained.  When he returns, he finds Lois has a young child and is living with someone else.  Supes never said goodbye to her--again, why is never explained.Meanwhile, Lex Luthor is up to the same loony and silly tricks that were evidence in the original Chris Reeve film with Gene Hackman.  If Lex had been played for laughs, it might have worked.  But his idea is played relatively seriously, and is in the end not much of a rip-off of Hackman's Lex's idea from the first Reeve film.There could have been a great storyline in Superman being jealous that Lois Lane is now involved with someone else.  The plot line is raised and then dropped like a hot lump of Kryptonite.Taken as it is, the film is a series of missed opportunities that grows weaker and weaker.  Increasingly it makes less and less sense.  Lex plans to create a new continent, conveniently taking out much of the US in the process.  Of course, he has maybe a total of five henchmen--how he plans to run things is anyone's guess.The film even recycles the girlfriend of Lex who has a heart of gold, the Valerie Perinne role from the first film.  There is a potential plot line with Lois' son, but it too goes nowhere.The fault lies not with the actors, who do their best.  It is the weak script that is the problem.Of course, it does not help that Brandon Routh simply recycles Christopher Reeve, in particular Reeve's 'Clark Kent' impersonation.  Something new might have been nice.  That Lois is a complete idiot who can not figure out who Supes really is...well, enough.You can buy it for the special effects, but you may wanna just wait for it to come on tv for free.

1023809,A115UP9LB30D8Z,B000J10EQU,Walter C. Broughton Jr.,"[6, 9]","When this movie was released theatrically, I was extremely excited.  I've seen all of the previous Superman movies and grew up watching Christopher Reeve as Superman during the late 70's and 80's.  I remember catching Superman & Superman II when they were released to cable and home video.  I also remember going to see Superman III & IV at the movies and later on cable.  So, I have knowledge on the movies.Superman Returns pays homage, not only to the Richard Donner's Superman and Superman II (cruelly credited to Rick Lester), but, also to Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder.  I found it quite easy to believe Brandon Routh as Superman because he looks so much like Christopher Reeve and his acting was actually pretty good.  I also accepted the fact that it was not Reeve I was watching, but, another actor picking up where Reeve left off (hint, hint).  It was also easy to figure out where Superman Returns actually take place.  I must admit that I first thought that it took place after Superman IV.  But, I remembered that in Superman IV, Clark Kent's mother had passed away.  So, I had to go back and realize that it took place right between II and III.  Having accepted that knowledge, I began to appreciate the film a lot more than I already did.The visuals are stunning.  The plot is fantastic.  The casting is great.  The only problem I have with the film is Superman's costume.  I wish the costume was brighter.  However, that's bearable because there's more to movies than special effects and costumes.  The acting, the visuals, the plot, etc. are fantastic and I can't wait to see what Bryan Singer and Brandon have to offer in the next Superman movies.Buy this film.  It is, indeed a classic and a respectable homage to Richard Donner and Christopher Reeve.

1023810,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000J10EQU,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[13, 22]","First a confession--I really liked Richard Donner's first film. If you didn't like Donner's treatment of the subject you're not going to like this film and you're probably not going to like my review. Then you'll give me a ""not helpful vote"" and move on to express your opinion. For those who enjoyed Donner's film read on for those that didn't skip this film and go see ""The Devil Wears Prada"" or ""X3"" again.The film is certainly flawed. 1) It's too long at 2 hours and 40 minutes. It could easily have been cut by 40 minutes without damaging the story. 2) The pacing is off (which probably has a lot to do with the running time). The film builds to a climax and has to rebuild again when its defused. 3)The ""Messiah"" imagery is overused. Richard Donner's original film was flawed as well (it was too long and the whole sequence with Superman and Lois Lane flying could have been cut to a minute)so, in that respect, ""Superman Returns"" has a lot in common with Richard Donner's film and ""Superman II"" (the film to which this is a sequel). It's still darn good entertainment.Like ""Superman"" ""Superman Returns"" is fun populist entertainment. ""Superman Returns"" doesn't have the dark edge (nor despite what's been written a gay subtext) like ""X-Men"" or ""X2"" the two other superhero films that director Bryan Singer has made. It's pure, sweet and comic with some interesting themes and conflict. Sure it isn't the Superman of the comics nor of the TV series or cartoons but I didn't care then nor do I care now about that. The late Christopher Reeve was perfectly cast as Superman and even Margot Kidder worked well as the scattered Lois Lane. Donner's job was to reinvent Superman for a new audience.Bryan Singer's film captures the same qualities that made Donner's film so fun to begin with and he's stayed true (for the most part) to the 1978 film's mythology. The film isn't perfect (how could it be? It's a sequel to a film made nearly 30 years ago!)but it's darn good.**There are some minor spoilers ahead so you may want to skip this paragraph if you haven't seen the film.**Superman (newcomer Brandon Routh in a marvelous performance that captures elements of Reeve's while establishing the role as his own)has been absent for 5 years. When the location of Krypton was identified he decided to return and see if anything remained of his home world. Exposure to Kryptonite in space weakened him but he manages to return to the Kent farm after his absence and recovers with the help of his mother Martha (the great Eva Marie Saint). He also briefly recalls his youth when he first discovered his superpowers.He returns as Clark Kent to Metropolis and is rehired by Perry White (Frank Langella)only to discover that Lois (Kate Bosworth)has moved on with her life and has a five year boy and has won the Pulitzer Prizer for an editorial entitled ""Why The World Doesn't Need Superman"". Clearly she has issues with Supes. She's also taken up with Perry's nephew and the paper's associate editor Richard White (James Marsden from ""X-Men"" and ""X-Men 2"")living with him. The only one who seems to have missed him is Jimmy (Sam Huntington).Lex Luther (Kevin Spacey who fills Gene Hackman's shoes nicely bringing a deliciously evil edge to Lex)is free as Superman never showed during the parole hearings to argue for his incarceration. He has a plan and it involves in a perfect quotation from the original film, ""land"" and the death of billions. Lex returns to the Fortress of Solitude and learns everything he can about Superman and his lost world before stealing important artifacts.**End of Spoilers**Singer recreates the feel of the original film while bringing a look that is uniquely his own to the film with its marvelous art deco production design. The story written in collaboration with ""X2"" writers Michael Dougherty & Dan Harris (who also co-wrote the forthcoming remake of ""Logan's Run"")quotes liberally from both Donner's ""Superman"" (even using footage and recordings of Marlon Brando as Jor-El)and the George Reeves TV series (with cameos by Noel Neill and Jack Larson). Heck, Singer even throws in the iconic final shot from ""Superman"" and ""Superman II"" with Supes circling the Earth for good measure. It's clear that this film was a labor of love but also an attempt to examine a lot of themes that are essential to the Superman mythos including the Messiah myth as well as the unresolved love affair with Lois. Singer's direction of the actors is top notch. If the film is flawed its due to its running time--""Superman Returns"" probably could have been trimmed by a good 20 minutes (much like Donner's ""Superman"")and worked just as well. Still all that screen time allows Singer to maximize the action set pieces (including a stunning robbery where Superman proves that bullets do indeed bounce off of him) without sacrificing the chararcter development.Routh manages to channel Reeve's winning performance as Superman/Clark Kent staying true to Reeve and Donner's(and writer Tom Mankiewicz's) interpretation of the character. Routh manages to inject enough of his own personality and make the character his own while still touching on Reeve's interpretation. Although Kate Kosworth's Lois might be a bit less kooky than Margot Kidder's take on the role she's as hard nosed a reporter and a bit more believable when it comes to helping Superman. James Marsden works well as the third part of this romantic love triangle as the new man in Lois' life. Kevin Spacey is brilliant as Lex much like Routh touching on Gene Hackman's performance but adding an edgy dangerous edge missing from Hackman's. Spacey's Lex is someone that you could believe would kill billions just to make a ""killing"" on a land deal.The visual effects are truly stunning and state of the art. The sequence involving the launch of the new space shuttle and its mishap is brilliantly realized. Much the same can be said for some of the other sequences involving the foiled robbery and the unexpectedly moving conclusion which refers to the Messiah myth and a recent Superman comic book.""Superman Returns"" is a loving valentine to a film that Singer clearly respected and loved (heck he even uses John Williams ""Superman"" theme and the same opening title design as in the first film). I'd highly recommend ""Superman Returns"" for fans of the first two Chris Reeve films. It's populist filmmaking at its best tackling a number of challenging themes within the entertaining package of a superhero fantasy. The bottom line go see it for yourself don't read all these reviews and if you don't like it leave midway through the movie and ask for your money back. Vote with your money not based on someone else's opinion.",5,"Solid ""sequel"" to ""Superman II"" has heart in the right place 4 stars",1151625600,"06 30, 2006",2006,6694,"['First', 'confession',

1023812,A20WKQ948WZOQJ,B000J10EQU,Wes Saylors Jr.,"[3, 5]","Superman is the Grand Old Man of superheroes, and so a movie dusting the character off after an almost twenty year absence needs to walk a fine line between reverance and pure high adventure.  Bryan Singer's Superman Returns does just that ... at once a loving homage to the great work Richard Donner did in 1978 with Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman and an elegant re-imagining of a hero we all know by heart, even if we think we don't.  What Bryan Singer delivers is a smart, action-packed and heartfelt movie, bringing Superman to us after a fruitless 5 year search for his home planet, Krypton.  His return to earth as Clark Kent coincides with Lex Luthor's newest real estate scheme, this one involving Kryptonite and a place to detonate it.  (It's funny that the Lex Luthor of the Superman movie universe is so brilliant but only obsessed with real estate.  And Kevin Spacey does the arch-nemesis complete justice ... making him both funny and very terrifying.)  Our first real encounter with Brandon Routh's Superman (an excellent Brandon Routh) is a set-piece involving a fiery airplane and an endangered Lois Lane.  This first glimpse of him is as satisfying as when Christopher Reeve snagged a falling Margot Kidder from the Daily Planet building and she screeched ""You've got me?  Who's got you?""  And statistically, flying is still the safest way to travel. -- Brandon Routh's Superman already has an old soul and he wins our hearts from the beginning.  He is an alien on an alien world and his outsider status never fails to touch us.  This is not a question of Superman Returns being the best movie since Reeves' first two outings.  Superman Returns belongs on the same shelf with these two.  It is, simply, the most satisfying super hero movie to come along in a long while.  Epic and intimate, spectacular and touchingly ordinary, Superman Returns does proper tribute to the first (and best) superhero flying around out there.

1023815,A3HP9JNRHOA5CW,B000J10EQU,William James Taylor IV,"[15, 44]","This could have been a great film, it wished to be. It only lacked the light to show the way. It also lacked an actor strong enough to anchor it.The Plot: Pitching itself as ""the Superman 3 that should have been"", scientists have spotted what appeared to be the remnants of his home world Krypton, prompting Superman (exit tall, dark, effortlessly heroic Christopher Reeve, enter tall, dark, metro sexual newcomer Brandon Routh) to leave Earth, without bothering to tell anyone, not even his would be lover and co-worker Lois Lane (exit Margot Kidder, enter Kate Bosworth), to see for himself what was floating around out there. Now he has returned to Earth after his 5 year space odyssey to learn more about Krypton has failed. The world has moved on, Lois has moved on, now a mother(!) with a nice guy fianc&eacute;, Richard White (James Marsden), nephew of their boss Perry (Frank Langella), and having written a Pulitzer prize winning article ""Why the World Does't Need Superman"", a thinly veiled rant of hell-hath-no-fury-like-a-woman-scorned. As Clark Kent, our protagonist gets his job back at the Daily Planet and then makes his grand return as Superman, triumphantly saving a jet to the hearty welcome of a grateful baseball stadium. But Lex Luthor (exit Gene Hackman, enter Kevin Spacey) is on the loose, and he's got revenge on his mind as well as a plan to create a new continent with the crystal technology he stole from Superman's Fortress of Solitude. Will Superman be able to thwart him?The story of how the first round of Superman films were eventually destroyed by off screen mishandling, proving that even Superman cannot overpower Hollywood stupidity, is now the stuff of legend, as is the story of Warner Brothers quest to bring Superman back into movie theaters, a quest that spanned almost 20 years and countless writers, directors, and actors. It's an evil story my friends, and the fact that WB still relies on Superman and Batman to bring in the audiences, for no better reason than the fact that they are Superman and Batman, when DC Comics is loaded with other deep, richly intriguing heroes, ranging from Wonder Woman to Aquaman, from Green Lantern to Flash, from Captain Marvel to the Martian Manhunter, is mind-boggling as well as disheartening. After goth-master Tim Burton, TV maestro JJ Abrams, fan boy champion Kevin Smith, and the much maligned Brett Ratner among others all tried and failed to bring about a story based upon the Death of Superman storyline from the early 90s, Bryan Singer, director of X-Men 1 and 2, came along, and pitched the idea to Warner Brothers of a kind of semi-sequel to the first two Superman films directed by Richard Donner and R. Lester, including the use of archive footage of Marlon Brando as Jor-El, the crystallized look of Krypton and the Fortress of Solitude, and using John Williams Superman score, as opposed to starting over with a new continuity like ""Batman Begins"".It was a bold, ambitious idea, and the final result is a valiant effort by a man who claims to have always loved, admired and identified with Superman, based more on his love for the TV series that starred George Reeves and the original Donner film than on the actual comics. But it just doesn't work. For starters, the demographic friendly leads, 26 year old Brandon Routh and 23 year old Kate Bosworth, are too young to believably pass themselves off as a Superman who has been missing for 5 years and a Lois Lane who is supposed to be an accomplished reporter turned single mother. Apparently Singer became so fixated on the idea of casting an unknown in the role of Superman, one of many moves that mimicked the approach of Donner all those years ago, that if Superman were to have been missing for any length of time, he should look old enough to have been missing and also look old enough to have the experience of a great hero under his belt. Jim Caviezel, at the ripe old age of 37, would have fit these requirements perfectly - already tall, dark and heroically handsome while also experienced enough as both an actor and as a human being to dig deep into the conflicting feelings within Superman. But Singer, blinded by hubris from his success with the X-Men films, and succumbing to the idea of actors young to enough to have multiple sequels belted out of them, decided to have his cake and eat it too by casting some young guy no one had ever heard of, and matching him with an equally young leading lady. Adding insult to injury, Singer and his idiot costume designer Louise Migenbach, butchered Superman's costume, darkening the red parts to maroon/burgundy shrinking and raising the ""S"" insignia and giving the costume an overall rubbery look. After all Migenbach's rantings of what a brilliant job she did updating the costume and bitching about how she always hated the suit's classic color scheme and all those speeches about how Superman should look as though he stepped right out of our collective conscience, Singer's Superman looks more like a high school jock in a bad Halloween costume. Donner's film didn't have nearly as big a budget as Singer's, and Donner didn't have nearly as advanced technology as Singer has, and Donner's people were still able to turn out a suit that looked exactly like the one in the comics, and it looked damn good too (the same can also be said of the Dean Cain TV series).Another problem is the very idea of clinging to the continuity of the earlier films. Let me just say right now that I know the Donner films were not perfect - they tended to suffer from unnecessary camp humor, best personified by Hackman's slumming stand up comedian approach to Lex Luthor, the slow-witted portrayal of Lois Lane, and the fumbling bumbling Clark Kent who wouldn't last five minutes at a burger joint, let alone a metropolitan newspaper. Also, the idea, while interesting, doesn't work because these earlier films are almost 30 years old, making them a bit outdated and probably don't rank as high with the modern audience as they do with Singer. I enjoy those films as much as anyone else, but if you're going to do new Superman films, you might as well give them their own continuity, their own sense of history away from their predecessors. Christopher Nolan recognized that what had worked for Batman during the Burton era no longer worked, and took the necessary steps to breathe life back into the franchise by creating a new continuity with its own sensibilities reflecting changes in both modern cinema and the modern comics. To squander all the potential that could be found and used from the comics in favor of using the old films, a sequel to another man's interpretation, is very misguided, not to mention lazy and uncreative, right down to virtually recreating the same sequences from the Donner film with a little tweaking, like the romantic flight between Superman and Lois, minus the voice over narration, add in Lois taking off her high heels as a symbolism for taking off her clothes for a lovemaking session. While the film never sinks to the painful depths of banality that the Star Wars prequels, Matrix sequels, King Arthur, and all the non-X-Men/Spider-Man films sank too, there's an overall feeling of been there, done that, and Singer's slick, sleek style isn't enough to cover for it. Good intentions he may have had, but this time Singer bit off more than he could chew; perhaps it's time he abandoned the world of pop spectacle film-making and went back to directing films grounded in reality like ""The Usual Suspects"".Adding insult to injury, the very idea of seeing what happens when a hero as important as Superman disappears and then returns could have made for a fascinating film (the idea was also explored in the ""Kingdom Come"" miniseries), or chronicling Superman's years in space examining the remnants of Krypton, just as ""Superman 3"" could have given serious exploration to what would happen if Superman went evil or how ""Superman 4"" could have explored what happens when a hero tackles a political issue of global importance (nuclear warfare). But the film never bothers to give much examination to its own idea - Superman saves the jet and the world falls in love with him all over again as he goes back to doing good deeds, with only Lois clinging to her burning resentment for Superman leaving in the first place and Luthor plotting to get even, never mind the fact that Superman leaving without telling anyone goes against his character. No real examination is given to the individual reactions of the other citizens in the world; they just go on about life as if Superman had never left in the first place. The introduction of Lois's kid and fianc&eacute; was also pretty tacky, and Superman, though clearly annoyed, did not display much bitterness or resentment towards his newfound rival (but then again, Superman always did handle his angst better than Spider-Man); very little examination is given to our title character's inner turmoil, his guilt over realizing his own mistakes, etc. We can only imagine how he would respond to the negative reactions of characters who are not Lois or Luthor. Or how he would have responded to coming back to the world and finding that another hero, say Wonder Woman or Captain Marvel, had replaced him as the Guardian of the Earth, the responses of others from this.Given the thankless task of being the new screen embodiment of the world's most famous hero, Brandon Routh, chosen for no better reason than the fact that he's young, unknown, inexpensive and in the eyes of some vaguely resembles Chris Reeve (he's actually two years younger than Tom Welling, who plays the teenager Clark on ""Smallville""), gives an admirable effort, but despite all his sincerity, he never inhabits the role the same way Reeve did and lacks the heroic aura of Reeve(though Routh's never quite as annoying as Hayden Christensen was as Anakin in the SW prequels). After a while you desperately want to like him, but Routh's clearly in over his head, most notably in his scenes with Ma Kent (Eva Marie Saint) where he tells her that what he found out there was ""a graveyard... I'm all that's left"", and at the end when he tells Lois's kid, who turns out to be Superman's illegitimate son, the same speech that Jor-El gave to the infant Superman in the first film. As stated above, Routh's boyish youth prevents us from really believing that he was missing for five years and had prior experience as Superman. Reeve was also young, but damn it, Reeve looked like a man, whereas Routh is bound to the uber-boyish looks that so many young actors are punished with these days; perhaps if he were 5 or 10 years older, or maybe if the film wasn't mindlessly lashed to the earlier films, Routh's efforts would not appear to be in vain. It's so easy to imagine the aforementioned Jim Caviezel in the same role and bringing in the necessary depth and gravitas to Superman's plights. The washed out costume doesn't do Routh any favors either.But if Routh comes up short in some areas, he's not nearly as bad in his role as Kate Bosworth is in hers. As stated above, Bosworth is simply too young to be the veteran reporter Lois Lane, or the mother of a five year old boy for that matter (unless we assume she had the kid when she was 17 or 18), and she's such a lightweight that everyone overshadows her.As the fianc&eacute; Richard White, James Marsden, so woefully underused as Cyclops in the X-Men trilogy, displays a gallant, heroic charm that makes it easier to root for him than the title character. Frank Langella and Sam Huntingten are good as Perry White and Jimmy Olsen respectively, and Kevin Spacey, as expected, is an improvement over the Lex given to us by Gene Hackman (himself a fine actor who simply chose the wrong approach), but suffers from a few instances where he is forced to resurrect the campy approach. Luthor's henchman are an embarrassment though - Kitty Kowalski is even more pointless than Eve Teschmacher of the earlier film, and that's saying something, especially considering how bad they made Parker Posey look (she probably would have made a better Lois Lane than Bosworth at any rate).Superman deserved better. If this film is remembered as a flop in light of the more popular response to ""Batman Begins""- but will probably be remembered more as a lukewarm/modest success - people will say it's because Batman's a better character than Superman or that people identify more with Batman than with Superman, but that's not the real problem. ""Batman Begins"" had a better idea, better writing, better directing, better casting and it shows.But if it's of any consolation, this film is still better than Catwoman.",1,Whatever Happened To The

1023818,ARFCORBCTKX1J,B000J10EQU,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[4, 5]","""Superman Returns"" is -- overall -- a terrific film. It has one of the most thrilling action sequences I've seen in a long time. It has a clean, spare script and Kevin Spacey's tightly wound, near-psychotic Lex Luthor. The story line not only connects logically with the first two films, but builds on the ""Superman as Christ-figure"" theme and brings it to a logical conclusion. Several scenes reference ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", a film with similar thematic elements. * Not to mention the outstanding cinematography and magnificent production design. And it has Bryan Singer's nearly perfect direction, reminding us that he also directed ""The Usual Suspects"", which the X films did not.So why haven't I given it five stars? Brandon Routh.George Reeves and Christopher Reeve truly inhabited the role. The brought to it an earnest intensity, acting as if they really believed they were this preposterous super-being. Note particularly the scene in the Donner version of ""Superman II"" where Reeve removes his glasses and stares at Lois, and he _is_ Superman, though in Clark Kent's clothes.Routh largely wanders through the film, an actor in a costume. We never believe he's Superman because _he_ never seems to believe it. When Luthor's goons beat him to a pulp, and Luthor pierces him with a kryptonite shiv, our reaction is more one of embarrassment than sympathy or pity. My attention was drawn to Superman's cape, which looks like a cheap vinyl shower curtain.This failing can be laid at Bryan Singer's feet, who cast and directed Routh. An actor playing Superman needs, more than anything else, ""screen presence"". Reeves and Reeve had it. Routh does not.Unless Routh dramatically improves, or someone finds a better actor, the future does not look bright for the Superman franchise.* After 28 years, I finally noticed that the three final notes of the opening section of John Williams' main theme (dah dah-da-da-dah, dum, dum, dum) are the Zarathustra ""World Riddle"" theme in reverse.",4,"Excellent, but a few notches below super...",1165190400,"12 4, 2006",2006,1987,"['Superman', 'Returns', 'overall', 'terrific', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'thrilling', 'action', 'sequences', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'clean', 'spare', 'script', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'tightly', 'wound', 'near-psychotic', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'story', 'line', 'not', 'only', 'logically', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'builds', 'Superman', 'Christ-figure', 'theme', 'logical', 'conclusion', 'Several', 'scenes', 'reference', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'film', 'similar', 'thematic', 'elements', '*', 'Not', 'mention', 'outstanding', 'cinematography', 'magnificent', 'production', 'design', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'direction', 'reminding', 'also', 'directed', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'X', 'films', 'did', 'not.So', 'why', 'have', ""n't"", 'given', 'five', 'stars', 'Brandon', 'Routh.George', 'Reeves', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'truly', 'inhabited', 'role', 'brought', 'earnest', 'intensity', 'acting', 'really', 'believed', 'were', 'preposterous', 'super-being', 'particularly', 'scene', 'Donner', 'version', 'Superman', 'II', 'where', 'Reeve', 'glasses', 'stares', 'Lois', 'Superman', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'clothes.Routh', 'largely', 'film', 'actor', 'costume', 'never', 'believe', 'Superman', '_he_', 'never', 'believe', 'When', 'Luthor', 'goons', 'beat', 'pulp', 'Luthor', 'kryptonite', 'shiv', 'reaction', 'more', 'one', 'embarrassment', 'sympathy', 'pity', 'attention', 'was', 'drawn', 'Superman', 'cape', 'cheap', 'vinyl', 'shower', 'curtain.This', 'failing', 'can', 'be', 'laid', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'feet', 'who', 'cast', 'directed', 'Routh', 'actor', 'playing', 'Superman', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'screen', 'presence', 'Reeves', 'Reeve', 'had', 'Routh', 'not.Unless', 'Routh', 'dramatically', 'someone', 'better', 'actor', 'future', 'not', 'look', 'bright', 'Superman', 'franchise', '*', '28', 'years', 'finally', 'noticed', 'three', 'final', 'notes', 'opening', 'section', 'John', 'Williams', 'main', 'theme', 'dah', 'dah-da-da-dah', 'dum', 'dum', 'dum', 'are', 'Zarathustra', 'World', 'Riddle', 'theme', 'reverse']",N/A

Like how Lex Luthor ""just knew"" that the seed crystal would incorporate other material into whatever grew from it - but not the skin cells left from handling it or the bugs in the water around it. Like why Lois Lane kept dragging her son into insanely dangerous situations.And why we're supposed to cheer for a guy who uses his super-powers to peek into bedroom windows of a former girlfriend and sneak in on her sleeping child.

There is almost no apparent dithering (little black dots from bad transfers and compression) on the image, and the color depth is amazing.  The 5.1 audio is taken advantage of fully, with certain parts of the movie so well mixed that even an audiophile finds themself looking over their shoulder for unusual sounds.The only major challenge with this movie is understanding WHEN this movie fits into the entire Superman life-line. There is a super brief explanation at the beginning of the film explaining that Superman has been away for five (5) years.  But if you were not a comic book reader, you may very well find yourself confused at the beginning. Not to worry, since you will see that it bears very little impact on the movie's storyline.The screenwriting and editing are very well done. The movie is action packed, but suffers from a very weak love story.  The writing is designed to allow you to enter the Superman world directly from this movie, without a major need to watch the original Superman movies to learn the lingo and learn a backstory.  The writers even take some liberties with the Superman/Lois relationship that have no real link to the previous movies.  This movie SHOULD be compared to the original Superman Movies, it's only fair, and as such is lackluster.  However, it is scary how much of Christopher Reeves you can actually see in this new actors performance, but in some respects, he is trying so hard, that it comes across as robotic, with very little evidence of the real emotion that Reeves protrayed.  On the other hand, this movie should also be respected for it's own unique high paced action/adventure style.

But as I am speaking Warner Bros. has decided as of May 31st. 2008 to stop all HD-DVD production so if you have to decide watch HD Format to back the industry has already done it for you.

Even hardcore Superman fans have voiced their displeasure of this film.  I, on the other hand really enjoyed this film.  Brandon Routh really embodies the dual role of Superman and Clark Kent.  He really reminds me of Christopher Reeve in a lot of ways.  If you listen he changes his octave of his voice when he is speaking as Superman similar to Reeve in Superman The Movie.  Kate Bosworth got so much crap for her protrayal of Lois Lane.  She is not as over the top as Margot Kidder but she still has that sex appeal and the same steely delivery that has made Lois Lane such an attractive character.

1023824,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B000J10EQU,Wuchak,"[4, 4]","Release date: June 28, 2006Director: Bryan SingerRuntime: 2 hours, 34 minutesLocations: New South Wales, Australia, and New York CityCast: Brandon Routh (Superman), Kate Bosworth (Lois), Kevin Spacey (Luthor), James Marsden (Richard White), Parker Posey (Kitty), Frank Langella (Perry White), Eve Marie Saint (Clark's mom) and Marlon Brando (Jor-el).STORY: Superman returns to Earth after five years trying to find out what happened to his homeworld. As Clark Kent he gets his job back at the Daily Planet newspaper, but finds out Lois Lane has moved on without him -- having a live-in fiance (Marsden) and a five-year-old child, not to mention winning a Pulitzer for her article ""Why the World Doesn't Need Superman."" Meanwhile Lex Luthor and his henchmen discover Superman's Fortress of Solitude and steal some of the alien crystals. Luthor's mad scheme is to create a new continent, killing billions of people in the process.Before seeing this film I scanned many of the Amazon reviews to see if it was worthwhile and the first thing I noticed was that most of the people wrote very long, detailed reviews. I thought, ""Wow, these Superman fans really take ol' Supes seriously."" I also noticed that people either seemed to love the film or hate it.Count me as one who loved it. I'm not the biggest Superman fan but I used to collect many of the comics and I loved the first two movies. I only had a half hour to kill last Saturday night but the movie was so good I watched well over an hour without really realizing it and finished it the next night. In other words, the film successfully pulled me into the story and I lost track of time. This is a good sign (especially when the film has so many dramatic parts).The story is an obvious retelling of the Christ story:--  Jor-el gives his son to protect (save) humankind.-- Superman repeatedly states that he's everywhere and will always be around (i.e. omnipresent).-- Luthor and his henchmen's beating of Supes is reminiscent of Christ's beating before his crucifixion.-- Superman sacrifices himself to save humanity from Luthor's new continent.-- When superman ""dies"" above the atmosphere of Earth he is shown in a cross posture.In adition to this, Lois Lane is an obvious type of atheism. Although she once believed in and even loved Superman, she's now convinced the world doesn't really need him. She's obviously unhappy and bitter; she lacks the pizzazz she had when she once believed.Of course, all this heavy symbolism is useless if the story itself fails to capture the viewer's attention. This is especially vital when the picture is two and a half hours long. But it succeeds!The film definitely has an epic vibe to it, even more so than the first in the series. It seems more serious, i.e. less campy, especially where Luthor and his team are concerned. The film also possesses an imperceptible reverent quality. Even though the whole Superman mythos is totally absurd, the film somehow enables the viewer to accept it as real. On top of all this there are numerous humorous parts, which are truly laugh-out-loud funny (watch out for the hilarious ""It's a bird,"" ""It's a plane"" piece).Other things worth commenting on:-- Some complain that Kate Bosworth lacks charisma as Lois Lane, but this all fits into the bitter ""I no longer believe"" subplot. Bosworth is fine in the role.-- Some complain about Superman's 5-year visit to Krypton. What's the problem? Part of my youth was spent in Minneapolis and I've gone back there numerous times to quell my curiosity. Why wouldn't Superman feel the same way? Why was he gone so long and why did he need a crystalized craft? Because he was potentially exposing himself to large amounts of Kryptonite (radioactive pieces of his homeworld) which would severely weaken him, not to mention he gets his powers from the Earth's sun.-- Some complain about Lois' fiance and her son, who may or may not be the offspring of Supes. Wouldn't it be natural for Lois to move on after about two years waiting? Her ""shacking up"" before marriage can be attributed to her new ""I no longer believe"" mentality.-- Love is a strong theme here as is fitting for any retelling of the Christ story. Superman loves Lois and vice versa, even though Lois is initially in denial. Love gives life and saves from death.-- I liked the fact that Lois' fiance (Marsden) isn't made out to be a villain. Interestingly, Lois picked a man who, as a pilot, could fly her around like Supes, albeit less spectacularly. I also like the fact that the film shows Lois being faithful to Marsden even though she discovers she still loves Superman. The human heart is capable of loving more than one person, but can only be faithful or committed to one, if you know what I mean.-- Frank Langella is his usual charismatic self as Perry White.-- Kevin Spacey is excellent as Luthor, much better than Hackman; this is especially evident as the story progresses. His larger-than-life lunatic scheme is truly fitting for Supe's main foe.-- There are numerous dramatic parts where the film takes its time to tell the story; there's obviously no rush to get to the next cgi action scene. Those with ADD beware. Needless to say, this is a film for adults even though kids will enjoy many aspects.-- ""Superman Returns"" was one of the most expensive films ever made at $209 million but made most of it back in North America ($200 million) while almost doubling it worldwide ($391 million). What's strange is studio heads were disappointed with these numbers (!), claiming it should have made $500 million.BOTTOM LINE: I was truly surprised to discover how good ""Superman Returns"" is. This is an epic and moving superhero film -- sci-fi/fantasy at it's best, in fact. Is it as good or better than the best superhero films? Not only is it as good or better, it's deeper.",5,"The Passion of the Christ, I mean Superman",1234310400,"02 11, 2009",2009,5818,"['Release', 'date', 'June', '28', '2006Director', 'Bryan',

Lex Luthor is still out to own the world and destroy Superman.Quick ThoughtsAn excellent tribute to the original Superman movie. Superman Returns is a great movie definitely worth seeing on the big screen. It has something for everyone, romance, drama, and action ... and oh yeah ... Superman! The movie was made keeping most of the story from the original movie, along with some light hearted scenes and some great one-liners with references from the original that were good for some laughs. For additional insight into the movie, go to your local comic shop and pick up ""Superman Returns Prequel"", a four part series setting up some storyline to the beginning of the movie.Now for some highlights, so if you have not seen the movie and plan on going, do not read any further. The story is that astronomers have discovered the remains of Krypton, so Superman travels to Krypton in hopes of finding survivors or at least something of his home planet, but only finds a barren waste land. He returns to Earth via crashing in Smallville, again, and reunites with his mother before heading off to Metropolis to reclaim his job at the Daily Planet.After returning to the Daily Planet, Clark is given back his job by Perry White (because another reporter has recently died), and Clark is also reunited with Jimmy Olsen who informs Clark that Lois is practically married to Richard White (Perry Whites nephew), and that Lois has a child.Meanwhile Lex Luthor is out of prison, because Superman did not appear in court to testify against Luthor for trying to send half of California into the sea. Now Luthor has found Supermans Fortress of Solitude and taken the crystals from within along with the Kryptonian knowledge of how they work. His plan is to use the crystals to create a new continent that will wipe out most of the United States. These events cause some catastrophes which give Clark the need to bring his Superman back into action.Now for the part that will shake the comic world up, during Lex's plans it becomes apparent that Lois' son, Grant, is extraordinary and after Superman foils Lex's plans once again, we find out that Grant is actually Superman's own son! (Which is probably referencing the love scene from Superman II, so the people that will be yelling at Bryan Singer about the ""Superboy"", well as I see it he was just expanding on what had already happened in an earlier movie.)All-in-all I thought Superman Returns was as good as the original Superman movie and is a great movie with superb acting and special effects. Brandon Routh does a great job of taking on the roles of Clark Kent and Superman (a tribute to the late Christopher Reeves). Kevin Spacey is one of my favorite actors and as expected does a great job to bringing life of Lex Luthor (once again a great tribute to Gene Hackman). There were some ""liberties"" taken with the storyline that may or may not determine how much a true Superman fan will like the movie, or not and as with most movies there a some predictable scenes. As for me, being a huge Superman (and Batman) fan, I loved the movie and anxiously await some sequels to further develop this new storyline of Superman/Clark Kent, Lois Lane, Richard White, and Grant, the son of Superman and Lois.[...]",4,A great tribute to the original Superman movies,1151452800,"06 28, 2006",2006,3727,"['Superman', 'Returns', 'PG-13', 'Theaters', '6/28/06Noteable', 'CastBrandon', 'Routh', 'Superman/Clark', 'Kent', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'James', 'Marsden', 'Richard', 'White', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'Kitty', 'Kowalski', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'Perry', 'White', 'Sam', 'Huntington', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'Martha', 'KentQuick', 'SynopsisAfter', 'spending', 'five', 'years', 'space', 'visit', 'remains', 'birthplace', 'Krypton', 'Superman', 'Earth', 'find', 'many', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'one', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'still', 'out', 'own', 'world', 'destroy', 'Superman.Quick', 'ThoughtsAn', 'excellent', 'tribute', 'original', 'Superman', 'movie', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'great', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'big', 'screen', 'something', 'everyone', 'romance', 'drama', 'action', 'oh', 'yeah', 'Superman', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'keeping', 'most', 'story', 'original', 'movie', 'light', 'hearted', 'scenes', 'great', 'one-liners', 'references', 'original', 'were', 'good', 'laughs', 'additional', 'insight', 'movie', 'go', 'local', 'comic', 'shop', 'pick', 'up', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'Prequel', 'four', 'part', 'series', 'setting', 'up', 'storyline', 'beginning', 'movie.Now', 'highlights', 'so', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'plan', 'going', 'do', 'not', 'read', 'further', 'story', 'astronomers', 'have', 'discovered', 'remains', 'Krypton', 'so', 'Superman', 'travels', 'Krypton', 'hopes', 'finding', 'survivors', 'least', 'something', 'home', 'planet', 'only', 'barren', 'waste', 'land', 'Earth', 'crashing', 'Smallville', 'again', 'mother', 'heading', 'off', 'Metropolis', 'reclaim', 'job', 'Daily', 'Planet.After', 'returning', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'Clark', 'given', 'back', 'job', 'Perry', 'White', 'reporter', 'recently', 'died', 'Clark', 'also', 'reunited', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'who', 'Clark', 'Lois', 'practically', 'married', 'Richard', 'White', 'Perry', 'Whites', 'nephew', 'Lois', 'child.Meanwhile', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'prison', 'Superman', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'court', 'testify', 'Luthor', 'trying', 'send', 'half', 'California', 'sea', 'Now', 'Luthor', 'found', 'Supermans', 'Fortress', 'Solitude', 'taken', 'crystals', 'Kryptonian', 'knowledge', 'how', 'work', 'plan', 'use', 'crystals', 'create', 'new', 'continent', 'will', 'wipe', 'out', 'most', 'United', 'States', 'events', 'cause', 'catastrophes', 'give', 'Clark', 'need', 'bring', 'Superman', 'back', 'action.Now', 'part', 'will', 'shake', 'comic', 'world', 'up', 'Lex', 'plans', 'apparent', 'Lois', 'son', 'Grant', 'extraordinary', 'Superman', 'foils', 'Lex', 'plans', 'once', 'again', 'find', 'out', 'Grant', 'actually', 'Superman', 'own', 'son', 'Which', 'probably', 'referencing', 'love', 'scene', 'Superman', 'II', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'yelling', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'Superboy', 'well', 'see', 'was', 'just', 'expanding', 'had', 'already', 'happened', 'earlier', 'movie', 'All-in-all', 'thought', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'Superman', 'movie', 'great', 'movie', 'superb', 'acting', 'special', 'effects', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'great', 'job', 'taking', 'roles', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Superman', 'tribute', 'late', 'Christopher', 'Reeves', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'expected', 'great', 'job', 'bringing', 'life', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'once', 'again', 'great', 'tribute', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'were', 'liberties', 'taken', 'storyline', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'determine', 'how', 'much', 'true', 'Superman', 'fan', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'not', 'most', 'movies', 'predictable', 'scenes', 'being', 'huge', 'Superman', 'Batman', 'fan', 'loved', 'movie', 'anxiously', 'await', 'sequels', 'further', 'develop', 'new', 'storyline', 'Superman/Clark', 'Kent', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Richard', 'White', 'Grant', 'son', 'Superman', 'Lois.', '[', ']']",N/A

1023827,AP3B615GM191G,B000J10EQU,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[2, 5]","I really want to embrace this film with open arms.  From the time that I was a child, I sat captivated by various Superman incarnations (most notably the first two Christopher Reeve movies), then got into the ""Supes"" spirit again when Smallville hit the airwaves on television.  When I saw this movie in the theater on its premiere night in 2006, I thought it was absolutely incredible.  With a bit of reflection, however, it is clear that ""Superman Returns"" is little more than wasted potential.For a basic plot summary, ""Superman Returns"" sees the Man of Steel (Brandon Routh) returning to Earth from a long hiatus of searching for the remains of his home planet Krypton.  Upon his return to Earth and re-entry into the Clark Kent persona, he notices some major changes afoot.  Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) is now married (husband played by James Marsden) and has a son (Tristan LeBeau), as well as a Pulitzer Prize for the article ""Why the World Doesn't Need Superman"".  One thing that hasn't changed, however, is Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) being up to his old nefarious deeds.I could prattle on and on about why this is a sub-par movie, but that dialogue can be summed up in two key bullet points:-First, is the utterly inconsistent plot/storyline.  Though director Bryan Singer wants us (the viewers) to believe that the world has ""moved on"" from Superman, it is as if nothing has changed whatsoever.  Clark still gets a job at the Daily Planet, all the characters act/look the same, and even the typical ""Supes vs. Lex"" rivalry is renewed with little to nothing new interjected.  The only addition?  A potential child figure in the life of the returning hero.  Without giving away any major spoilers, this is a TERRIBLE addition to the movie and only serves to complicated things more (as opposed to adding any real emotion).-Secondly, the writing/dialogue is atrocious.  Spacey is not a good Lex Luthor (though whether by casting or given dialogue I am not entirely sure), Bosworth is a middling Lois, and Routh can only channel Reeve (again, a failure to ""move on"" in the storyline).  The two actors who really stand out are Frank Langella (playing Perry White) and Sam Huntington (Jimmy Olsen), and even they are not on screen all that much.Simply put, ""Superman Returns"" is a movie for its time...and nothing more.  It was made to capitalize on the burgeoning success of Smallville, which had thrust ""Superman mania"" back into popular culture once again.  Singer does an okay job of playing to those who just wanted to see the suit, cape, Reeve impersonation, and flying scenes, but other than that he turns in an utter stinker.Ironically, while the cannon established in this effort wipes the events of Superman III & IV off the map, ""Superman Returns"" will likely not ever be considered cannon in its own right.  For rabid Superman fans, this is frustrating considering the massive potential that could have evolved from a truly great film at that time.The final verdict: Unless you care about nothing else but the visuals, this will be a severe disappointment.  You'll want to love it, but it doesn't ever give you a chance.",2,Left Me Feeling Sad & Angry,1333756800,"04 7, 2012",2012,3133,"['really', 'want', 'embrace', 'film', 'open', 'arms', 'time', 'was', 'child', 'sat', 'captivated', 'various', 'Superman', 'incarnations', 'most', 'notably', 'first', 'two', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'movies', 'then', 'got', 'Supes', 'spirit', 'again', 'when', 'Smallville', 'hit', 'airwaves', 'television', 'When', 'saw', 'movie', 'theater', 'premiere', 'night', '2006', 'thought', 'was', 'absolutely', 'incredible', 'bit', 'reflection', 'however', 'clear', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'little', 'more', 'wasted', 'potential.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'Man', 'Steel', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'returning', 'Earth', 'long', 'hiatus', 'searching', 'remains', 'home', 'planet', 'Krypton', 'return', 'Earth', 're-entry', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'persona', 'major', 'changes', 'afoot', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'now', 'married', 'husband', 'played', 'James', 'Marsden', 'son', 'Tristan', 'LeBeau', 'as', 'well', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'article', 'Why', 'World', 'Does', ""n't"", 'Need', 'Superman', 'One', 'thing', ""n't"", 'changed', 'however', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'being', 'up', 'old', 'nefarious', 'deeds.I', 'could', 'prattle', 'about', 'why', 'sub-par', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'two', 'key', 'bullet', 'points', '-First', 'utterly', 'inconsistent', 'plot/storyline', 'Though', 'director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'viewers', 'believe', 'world', 'moved', 'Superman', 'nothing', 'changed', 'whatsoever', 'Clark', 'still', 'job', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'characters', 'act/look', 'same', 'even', 'typical', 'Supes', 'vs.', 'Lex', 'rivalry', 'renewed', 'little', 'nothing', 'new', 'interjected', 'only', 'addition', 'potential', 'child', 'figure', 'life', 'returning', 'hero', 'giving', 'away', 'major', 'spoilers', 'TERRIBLE', 'addition', 'movie', 'only', 'complicated', 'things', 'more', 'opposed', 'adding', 'real', 'emotion', '.-Secondly', 'writing/dialogue', 'atrocious', 'Spacey', 'not', 'good', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'casting', 'given', 'dialogue', 'am', 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'Bosworth', 'middling', 'Lois', 'Routh', 'can', 'only', 'channel', 'Reeve', 'again', 'failure', 'move', 'storyline', 'two', 'actors', 'who', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'are', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'playing', 'Perry', 'White', 'Sam', 'Huntington', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'screen', 'much.Simply', 'put', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'movie', 'time', 'nothing', 'more', 'was', 'made', 'capitalize', 'burgeoning', 'success', 'Smallville', 'had', 'thrust', 'Superman', 'mania', 'back', 'popular', 'culture', 'once', 'again', 'Singer', 'okay', 'job', 'playing', 'who', 'just', 'wanted', 'see', 'suit', 'cape', 'Reeve', 'impersonation', 'flying', 'scenes', 'other', 'utter', 'stinker.Ironically', 'cannon', 'established', 'effort', 'events', 'Superman', 'III', 'IV', 'map', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'will', 'likely', 'not', 'ever', 'be', 'considered', 'cannon', 'own', 'right', 'rabid', 'Superman', 'fans', 'frustrating', 'considering', 'massive', 'potential', 'could', 'have', 'evolved', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'time.The', 'final', 'verdict', 'Unless', 'care', 'nothing', 'else', 'visuals', 'will', 'be', 'severe', 'disappointment', ""'ll"", 'want', 'love', ""n't"", 'ever', 'give', 'chance']",N/A
