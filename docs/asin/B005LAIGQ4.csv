Instead it's a well-told reinacted story:  not over or under done, touching our heart strings with every individual and party having their own side to tell.  At first, the centerpiece is the plight of three whales stuck in the ice with the temperature and their life chances dropping by the hour.  In the details are the improbable true-life deliberations of saving those whales.  But the heart of the matter are people with their own agendas, feelings, and motivations.  The movie does a smart job of focusing on each of them and what they each do, say, and feel.It is a true story, of course, and it all starts when an Anchorage reporter and anchorman (Krasinski) spends some time doing a human interest segment in Barrow for his local TV station.  It is by accident while shooting a young Inuit's friend doing snowmobile stunts that he discovers a displaced whale surfacing in what looks like an ice fishing hole.  As true-to-life coincidences go, his ex-girlfriend (Barrymore) works for GreenPeace, the environmental civilian force who police alleged wrong-doers on many fronts, and she becomes the prime mover for saving these whales.As you might expect, the story goes from the Local Hero to a hot national and then international news item.  The ramifications are also national and international as it involves an oil executive (Danson), the military (headed by a colonel [Mulroney]), and The President and Vice President (who are doing everything to shore up the latter's election).  Among the center of the ice storm is the Inuit (Eskimo) community who simply preserving their traditions and their livelihood.What I liked about the film is how well they pace their story, while they briskly take any and all the story components without confusing a family audience.  The actual news footage (done since the likes of 'Forrest Gump') is enriching, and their portrayals are wonderfully solid.  No one is close to being an Oscar contender, but the energy, personality, and the genre of this movie make you glad this is the case.  Rachel, the environmentalist, may have us on her side with her cause, but not always on the side of her character.  The oil executive may be in it for the PR, but Danson and the script keep it honest without having him twirl his moustache like a cardboard villain.At times funny, but nearly always engaging and fair-minded, 'Big Miracle' is a fine family movie that takes an interest in human hearts and achievement as much as it does with its environmental message.",4,"Fair-Minded, Fun, Family Film",1346630400,"09 3, 2012",2012,2595,"['Right', 'bat', 'Miracle', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'ham-fisted', 'environmental', 'propaganda', 'piece', 'Instead', 'well-told', 'reinacted', 'story', 'not', 'done', 'touching', 'heart', 'strings', 'individual', 'party', 'having', 'own', 'side', 'tell', 'first', 'centerpiece', 'plight', 'three', 'whales', 'stuck', 'ice', 'temperature', 'life', 'chances', 'dropping', 'hour', 'details', 'are', 'improbable', 'true-life', 'deliberations', 'saving', 'whales', 'heart', 'matter', 'are', 'people', 'own', 'agendas', 'feelings', 'motivations', 'movie', 'smart', 'job', 'focusing', 'what', 'do', 'say', 'feel.It', 'true', 'story', 'course', 'when', 'Anchorage', 'reporter', 'anchorman', 'Krasinski', 'time', 'doing', 'human', 'interest', 'segment', 'Barrow', 'local', 'TV', 'station', 'accident', 'shooting', 'young', 'Inuit', 'friend', 'doing', 'snowmobile', 'stunts', 'displaced', 'whale', 'surfacing', 'what', 'ice', 'fishing', 'hole', 'true-to-life', 'coincidences', 'go', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Barrymore', 'GreenPeace', 'environmental', 'civilian', 'force', 'who', 'alleged', 'wrong-doers', 'many', 'fronts', 'prime', 'mover', 'saving', 'whales.As', 'might', 'expect', 'story', 'Local', 'Hero', 'hot', 'national', 'then', 'international', 'news', 'item', 'ramifications', 'are', 'also', 'national', 'international', 'oil', 'executive', 'Danson', 'military', 'headed', 'colonel', '[', 'Mulroney', ']', 'President', 'Vice', 'President', 'who', 'are', 'doing', 'everything', 'shore', 'up', 'latter', 'election', 'center', 'ice', 'storm', 'Inuit', 'Eskimo', 'community', 'who', 'simply', 'preserving', 'traditions', 'livelihood.What', 'liked', 'film', 'how', 'well', 'pace', 'story', 'briskly', 'take', 'story', 'components', 'confusing', 'family', 'audience', 'actual', 'news', 'footage', 'done', 'likes', ""'Forrest"", 'Gump', 'enriching', 'portrayals', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'solid', 'one', 'close', 'being', 'Oscar', 'contender', 'energy', 'personality', 'genre', 'movie', 'make', 'glad', 'case', 'Rachel', 'environmentalist', 'may', 'have', 'side', 'cause', 'not', 'always', 'side', 'character', 'oil', 'executive', 'may', 'be', 'PR', 'Danson', 'script', 'keep', 'honest', 'having', 'twirl', 'moustache', 'cardboard', 'villain.At', 'times', 'funny', 'nearly', 'always', 'engaging', 'fair-minded', ""'Big"", 'Miracle', 'fine', 'family', 'movie', 'interest', 'human', 'hearts', 'achievement', 'as', 'much', 'environmental', 'message']",N/A

1465174,A1GVKGSN6V1VTX,B005LAIGQ4,Arctic Voice Earl,"[69, 70]","My wife and I were living in Barrow back in 1988 when the three California Gray Whales got stuck in the ice near Point Barrow. It was an exciting time and we were eagerly waiting to see the movie --how Hollywood would tell the story.  When the whales were first discovered, I had just started working as the newsperson for local radio station KBRW. Got busy very quickly!It was great to see some places there again, like the Mexican Restaurant ---really named Pepes.And young Ahmaogak Sweeney in the role of Nathan, who learns about the Inupiat Eskimos and their relationships with whales from his Appa, or Grandfather. Nathan also figures out a way to supplement his allowance when some 200 outside Media folks arrived in Barrow and wanted to get out to the Arctic Ocean ice where the whales were trapped.He gathers up some cardboard and sells it to the reporters so their feet won't get cold standing on the ice.I was out there on the ice and don't remember such a thing, but it might have been a good idea.The movie is listed as ""Inspired by a True Story.""  So we were prepared for Hollywood to stretch and substitute.Two major ones:  It was an Inupiat Eskimo hunter, Roy Ahmaogak, who first discovered the stranded whales, not a  newsman.And second ---the Barrow whalers do not hunt the California Gray Whales. They hunt the larger Bowhead whales.The movie includes arguments that a quick rescue was needed so the Native crews would not hunt them.The Whaling captains held their meeting early on, before most media arrived, and said they would do all they could to rescue the whales.One of the movie's strong points is recreating the whales, barnacles and all. And correctly showing how local people and visitors wanted to touch the whales, and sometimes encourage them to hang on.As two of my friends who were wildlife biologists said, it provided a rare opportunity to see such whales close up.The movie also shows how the key to the apparent rescue was low-tech ----the Natives cutting out a series of breathing holes with chain saws and then the water circulators from two caring men from Minnesota which kept the beathing holes open.  And finally the Russian Icebreaker which breaks through a pressure ridge standing between the whales and open water in leads.Did the whales actually make it out and all the way down to their feeding areas off of California and Mexico?The Federal official in charge declared that the survivors did. But they were not fitted with little transmitters. I'd like to think that they did.

1465204,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B005LAIGQ4,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 4]","BIG MIRACLE (2012, 95 minutes) is a hilarious, touching and gently biting satire of a true story. Well, it is based upon a true story and is chockablock full of original footage and TV casts to prove it.This is the true story of the family of whales caught in Barrow, Alaska in 1988. Suddenly cut off from their usual migration path toward the open ocean, the whale family took turns breathing through a hole in the ice. While a bored local reporter dreaming of a place on ABC or NBC originally breaks the whale story, his bonkers Greenpeace pal (Drew Barrymore) is already hollering about how to ""save the whales"".The film shows what must be the actual birth of the ""save-the-whales"" movement, which quickly became one hell of a joke as I recall. It is too bad, because we are seeing more species pushed toward extinction and the Inuits who eat whale are getting pushed that way also. This film does not shy away from the West's ignorance of these Natives, but instead confronts it with gleeful cheer.BIG MIRACLE also addresses the Alaskan oil rush of the 1980s, which somehow reminds me of the hydraulic fracturing craze happening now. One thing I definitely do not recall which this film showcases without satire or even comment is then-President Ronald Reagan's personal interest in the fate of the whales.In addition there are two wonderful fellows from Minnesota who suddenly appear in Barrow with their ice-melting machine when the whales' breathing hole begins to ice over - and if that machine is true to life, they must be gazillionaires by now!You can't miss owning and enjoying this film. It is in a sense a national treasure of entertaining documentation, the story of at least one prominent incident in which Greenpeace actually did something useful, tells us how we began to care about whales and try to save them, addresses the Alaskan oil craze and the natives from the region who suffer from our brute insensitivity to them.One thing I must caution viewers about: Drew Barrymore looks rather the worse for wear. I absolutely love her, and this appearance tore me to bits. She truly looks like she is recovering from a stroke or something, and I will tell you frankly I don't have the heart to research her health.For any Drew fans out there, be warned. In several scenes, she appears to be at least marginally paralyzed and is speaking out of one side of her mouth, speech slurred. What is worse is she doesn't appear to be that bad in her early scenes.In any case this thing is fun and hilarious - it is also as compelling as any political tale, and reminded me of the excellent HBO Films'Recount(see my review). Watch the end credits for the real people appearing alongside the scenes in which they appeared in the film, especially the Greenpeace lady.

This is a gently made film that gets its point across in a warmly entertaining way - and it is a true story!Thomas Rose' book FREEING THE WHALES forms the basis for this story, adapted for the screen by Jack Amiel and Michael Begler.  Ken Kwapis directs. In brief summery (everyone knows this story by now), an animal-loving volunteer and a small-town news reporter are joined by a native Alaskan boy to rally an entire community - and eventually rival world superpowers - to save a family of majestic gray whales trapped by rapidly forming ice in the Arctic Circle.'The cast is a large one with some actors only appearing briefly but in roles that show their professional an also their emotional support for placing this subject before the public. In the lead roles are John Krasinski, Drew Barrymore, Ted Danson and Tim Blake Nelson, but the remainder of the cast includes Dermot Mulroney, Kathy Baker, Kristin Bell, James LeGros and a fine supporting cast of Inuit actors and others.The special effects are credible and deeply moving as the whales are released form their frozen captivity.

1465211,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B005LAIGQ4,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 2]","Some years ago the tiny town of Barrow, Alaska got kicked around when vampires chose it for their latest hunting ground. There may even have been a movie about it. From a more heartwarming front, Barrow, Alaska was also the site of a bunch of disparate people and corporations that came together for a wonderful cause. Were you around back in October, 1988, when rose that furor over them three California grey whales what got trapped in the ice off Barrow? The media, on a global scale, ate this story up.Encircled by solid ice and stranded five miles away to open water. Five miles is too long for the whales to swim AND breathe underwater. Several of the Alaskan whalers favored putting them out of their misery and using them as food. Local television reporter Adam Carlson (John Krasinski), who dreams of going national, lands the story that promptly ignites a massive groundswell of support. Soon Adam and his wilful ex, passionate Greenpeace activist Rachel Kramer (Drew Barrymore), are in the middle of an epic rescue operation. Because who doesn't love whales? To quote one of the officials of the Alaska National Guard, ""It's like going out and freeing Bambi."" If it were a family of platypuses caught in ice, I wonder, would they have warmed up the Soviet icebreaker?Back in 1988, for a brief period of time, the media descended on a tiny town three hundred miles north of the Arctic Circle (and boasting the northernmost Mexican restaurant on the planet). It's a feel-good story. I remember flashing a huge, happy grin when the whales were freed. Recall that this was when the two global superpowers, the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., were constantly at loggerheads. Excepting that one brief interlude of detente during the whale-saving campaign. In a remarkable effort, Eskimo whalers, Federal and state officials, the National Guard, the oil people, and environmentalists, and, yes, the Soviets all shelved agendas and got together in the freezing cold. That's a lot of hot coffee.BIG MIRACLE chronicles the daunting challenges that faced the would-be rescuers and how these challenges were overcome. One example: The battered, exhausted whales only had an open pool of water from which they could draw in oxygen. Alaskan whalers applied chain saws to chop off blocks of ice to expand the pool, except that the ice reformed in such alarming pace that they were hard pressed to keep up. One solution: two oddball characters from Minnesota with an unorthodox invention.It's a good cast that toes the line between groundedness and rampant sentimentality. Drew Barrymore and John Krasinski anchor the film, but Kristen Bell (as an ambitious reporter) and Ted Danson (as an, um, oily oil baron) provide good support. Dermot Mulroney's character doesn't get as much screen time, but his is a pretty interesting story in real life. He plays a brusque military pilot tasked with hauling a Veco barge to Point Barrow (the barge will hopefully punch thru the ice barrier). He ends up engaged in several tense phone conversations with a pretty liaison from the White House. This really isn't a romantic comedy picture, but you get the gist. And again, unlike Barrow's vampire invasion, this is a true story.The DVD's bonus stuff:- Audio Commentary by director Ken Kwapis- ""Truth is Stranger than Fiction"" - the behind-the-scenes featurette, with interviews with Cindy Lowry, the real life activist on whom Rachel is based (00:12:10 minutes)-  4 Deleted Scenes (each with the director's intro), including the hilarious ""The Prince of Whales"" segment (00:06:52 minutes)",4,"""I think Barrow might have one great story left...""",1356739200,"12 29, 2012",2012,3563,"['years', 'tiny', 'town', 'Barrow', 'Alaska', 'got', 'kicked', 'when', 'vampires', 'chose', 'latest', 'hunting', 'ground', 'may', 'even', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'more', 'heartwarming', 'front', 'Barrow', 'Alaska', 'was', 'also', 'site', 'bunch', 'disparate', 'people', 'corporations', 'came', 'together', 'wonderful', 'cause', 'Were', 'around', 'back', 'October', '1988', 'when', 'rose', 'furor', 'three', 'California', 'grey', 'what', 'got', 'trapped', 'ice', 'Barrow', 'media', 'global', 'scale', 'ate', 'story', 'up.Encircled', 'solid', 'ice', 'stranded', 'five', 'miles', 'away', 'open', 'water', 'Five', 'miles', 'too', 'long', 'whales', 'swim', 'AND', 'breathe', 'underwater', 'Several', 'Alaskan', 'whalers', 'favored', 'putting', 'misery', 'using', 'food', 'Local', 'television', 'reporter', 'Adam', 'Carlson', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'who', 'going', 'national', 'story', 'promptly', 'massive', 'groundswell', 'support', 'Soon', 'Adam', 'wilful', 'ex', 'passionate', 'Greenpeace', 'activist', 'Rachel', 'Kramer', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'are', 'middle', 'epic', 'rescue', 'operation', 'who', ""n't"", 'love', 'whales', 'quote', 'one', 'officials', 'Alaska', 'National', 'Guard', 'going', 'out', 'freeing', 'Bambi', 'were', 'family', 'platypuses', 'caught', 'ice', 'wonder', 'would', 'have', 'warmed', 'up', 'Soviet', 'icebreaker', 'Back', '1988', 'brief', 'period', 'time', 'media', 'descended', 'tiny', 'town', 'three', 'hundred', 'miles', 'north', 'Arctic', 'Circle', 'boasting', 'northernmost', 'Mexican', 'restaurant', 'planet', 'feel-good', 'story', 'remember', 'flashing', 'huge', 'happy', 'grin', 'when', 'whales', 'were', 'freed', 'Recall', 'was', 'when', 'two', 'global', 'superpowers', 'U.S.', 'U.S.S.R.', 'were', 'constantly', 'loggerheads', 'Excepting', 'one', 'brief', 'interlude', 'detente', 'whale-saving', 'campaign', 'remarkable', 'effort', 'Eskimo', 'whalers', 'Federal', 'state', 'officials', 'National', 'Guard', 'oil', 'people', 'environmentalists', 'yes', 'Soviets', 'shelved', 'agendas', 'got', 'together', 'freezing', 'cold', 'lot', 'hot', 'coffee.BIG', 'MIRACLE', 'daunting', 'faced', 'would-be', 'rescuers', 'how', 'challenges', 'were', 'overcome', 'One', 'example', 'battered', 'exhausted', 'whales', 'only', 'had', 'open', 'pool', 'water', 'could', 'draw', 'oxygen', 'Alaskan', 'whalers', 'applied', 'chain', 'saws', 'chop', 'off', 'blocks', 'ice', 'expand', 'pool', 'ice', 'reformed', 'such', 'alarming', 'pace', 'were', 'hard', 'pressed', 'keep', 'up', 'One', 'solution', 'two', 'oddball', 'characters', 'Minnesota', 'unorthodox', 'invention.It', 'good', 'cast', 'line', 'groundedness', 'rampant', 'sentimentality', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'film', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'ambitious', 'reporter', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'um', 'oily', 'oil', 'baron', 'provide', 'good', 'support', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'character', ""n't"", 'get', 'as', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'story', 'real', 'life', 'brusque', 'military', 'pilot', 'tasked', 'hauling', 'Veco', 'barge', 'Point', 'Barrow', 'barge', 'will', 'hopefully', 'punch', 'ice', 'barrier', 'up', 'engaged', 'several', 'tense', 'phone', 'conversations', 'pretty', 'liaison', 'White', 'House', 'really', ""n't"", 'romantic', 'comedy', 'picture', 'get', 'gist', 'again', 'Barrow', 'vampire', 'invasion', 'true', 'story.The', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'stuff', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'director', 'Ken', 'Kwapis-', 'Truth', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'interviews', 'Cindy', 'Lowry', 'real', 'life', 'activist', 'whom', 'Rachel', 'based', '00:12:10', 'minutes', '4', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'director', 'intro', 'including', 'hilarious', 'Prince', 'Whales', 'segment', '00:06:52', 'minutes']",N/A

Now with the help of his Greenpeace girlfriend Rachel (Barrymore) and a few others the race is on to save the whales.

Not knowing what happened made the movie seem more tense to me and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.

Based on a book ""Freeing the Whales: How the Media Created the World's Greatest Non-Event"" written by Tom Rose, ""Big Miracle"" follows how the stranding of three whales leads to the ""big miracle"" involving environmentalists, oil companies, the Inuit, the governor and finally, two superpowers, through the pre-internet media.There are several narrative threads woven together. John Krasinski plays a local reporter Adam Carlson. Drew Barrymore is a Greenpeace activist Rachel Kramer. It is suggested that they were once dating but then split up. The stranded whales bring them back together. The two have nice chemistry, but more interesting is the real-life based story of Colonel Scott Boyer (Dermot Mulroney), a National Guard pilot and Kelly Meyers (Vinessa Shaw), an executive assistant for Cabinet affairs at White House. Also, two Alaskan actors John Pingayak as Inupiat whaler Malik and Ahmaogak Sweeney as his grandson Nathan steal every scene they are in.""Big Miracle"" is a family picture, but not all happy moments. While the film has a positive message, it also does not forget the self-interested agendas of some people for saving the whales. The media extravaganza is depicted with humor and cynicism. Director Ken Kwapis (""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"") keeps the action moving with credible characters and locations (filmed in Alaska).
