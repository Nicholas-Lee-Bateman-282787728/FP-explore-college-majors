How truly does that come to roost in the life of the title character, Dave Spritz(er)(Nicolas Cage) in Gore Verbinski's 'The Weather Man'.  All the mundane chaos of an alienated man come to sit on Dave as he endures the aftermath of divorce and the thrown food and drink from what could be the modern equivalent of the cheaper seats in Shakespeare's time.  Yes, he's Chicago's weatherman, with all the screen charm, but none of the meterological credentials to be a highly paid man at the helm of one of life's easiest jobs.  Besides being pelted by fast food and convenience store fare, he is trying to engage his two teenage children during his visitations.  His daughter is overweight and wears suggestive clothing that get her labelled a ""camel-toe"" by her insensitive peers.  Which brings us to his father (Michael Caine), whom Dave wishes to impress, a pulitzer-prize winning author who is dying of cancer.  He finds out about the tauntings and seems to be one step ahead of his son in every aspect.  (Dave is even trying to write a novel to earn his father's admiration.)  Dave seems oblivious and incompetent in his bid to get any respect.  He is a chief candidate to replace the weather man for a national morning show, 'Hello, America' with Bryant Gumbel.  This is merely a make-over, a veneer to true happiness, and Dave knows it.  He merely wants to put his life back together, to get his wife back and show his father that he's not just letting everything slip through his fingers.  It is an exercise in futility.  To add to his chaos, he tries to endear himself to his daughter by taking her to archery lessons and a Winterfest.  Her overweight, underdog condition only make these outings a disaster.  Worse yet, his son is becoming prey to a drug counselor who is really a pedophile.  Some of the creepiest scenes show us how the predator tries to win him over.  All of Dave's overtures to his father, his ex-wife, and his children show ineptitude and anguish that is clearly tangible.  Some of the best scenes demonstrate Dave taking the helm and doing something credible to help his struggling children and his dying father.So what's the point?  Accuracy in relationships, as well as in weather forecasts, is keynote to success?  I wager the movie really tells us that there is more to happiness than the consumerism of fast-food life and fast-food relationships.  Nicholas Cage brings all the pathos home to us with his manic-depressive character and the narration of his innermost thoughts.  Verbinski's direction is perfection.  The way every scene is brought to a slow-motion standstill or every bow and arrow sequence is 'Matrix' perfect.  There is a mundaneness about 'The Weather Man,' but its artistic treatment is certainly transcending enough.  We can't reach the conclusion without coming to some sense that there really is more to life than what the modern world seems to offer.  The weather man knows that life isn't predictable, but living up to the demands of the weathering changes isn't easy, either.  He also learns that, as in archery and in relationships, you must take your time, develop your skills, and choose your targets to earn bullseyes in life.

962666,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000CSUNQQ,Alistair McHarg,"[2, 4]","The Weather Man is a very unusual movie - it's a big buck Hollywood vehicle with the vibe and sensibility of an angst-besotted love song to existentialism - the sort of thing one usually encounters only in art houses.  Critics and audiences will most likely have difficulty pigeonholing it, which is one of its greatest strengths - though certainly a box-office liability.  Director Gore Verbinski took a leave of absence from his ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" blockbustering, and Nicholas Cage apparently regained his sense of why he became an actor.  Armed with a superb script by Steve Conrad, and equally impressive score, Verbinski demonstrates what confident direction looks like.  He has complete faith in his actors - Michael Cane is amazing - his script - and the cinematography.  Everything comes together so neatly you never notice - the timing and pacing in this film are flawless.Conrad wrote the screenplay for Wrestling Ernest Hemingway, an overlooked gem that, despite being somewhat sentimental, really delivers.  Surprisingly he was also behind Happyness - which leads me to believe that directorial ineptitude and Will Smith weight-throwing were responsible for turning thought provoking drama into twaddle so saccharine it would cause Disney to blush.  The chirpiness of Happyness is almost antithetical to the weary, gray, dread of The Weather Man.  Those who do comment on this film will probably call it a black comedy, although it is more properly a tragedy with some scattered comic moments.  The ""random showers"" of Big Gulps and Milkshakes are funny in their way, but tragic also, as when weather man David Spritz, Cage, is splattered en route to the ""living funeral"" of his father.  These bombings remind us that rain falls on the just and unjust equally, usually when it's least convenient.This film deliberately avoids high drama and focuses instead on the excruciating pain of small dramas.  The life of David Spritz is hardly remarkable.  His marriage is on the rocks, he has no real connection with his children, his job offers him no personal satisfaction or sense of meaning and value, and his father looks on him with exhausted and gentle disappointment.  Though financially successful, he seems to instinctively get everything wrong - as when, in an attempt to be playful, he throws a snowball at his estranged wife and accidentally hits her in the face, thus breaking her glasses.  Spritz is not bad, he's just empty - a prototypical 21-st Century man.  There is no ending to give away, there is barely a plot - but director Verbinski masterfully lures us into Dave's world, and we do feel for him.  This is really an exceptional movie.As an aside, Bryant Gumbel appears at several points in the film, convincingly playing himself.  I found it gratifying to see Mr. Gumbel.  For many years the sartorial talking head has provided a positive role model for white people across America, whether in the inner city or on the golf courses of suburbia.",4,"Now The Weather: Fair Today, Unfair Tomorrow",1191369600,"10 3, 2007",2007,2981,"['Weather', 'Man', 'very', 'unusual', 'movie', 'big', 'buck', 'Hollywood', 'vehicle', 'vibe', 'sensibility', 'angst-besotted', 'love', 'song', 'existentialism', 'sort', 'thing', 'one', 'usually', 'only', 'art', 'houses', 'Critics', 'audiences', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'have', 'difficulty', 'pigeonholing', 'one', 'greatest', 'strengths', 'certainly', 'box-office', 'liability', 'Director', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'took', 'leave', 'absence', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'blockbustering', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'apparently', 'regained', 'sense', 'why', 'became', 'actor', 'Armed', 'superb', 'script', 'Steve', 'Conrad', 'equally', 'impressive', 'score', 'Verbinski', 'what', 'confident', 'direction', 'complete', 'faith', 'actors', 'Michael', 'Cane', 'amazing', 'script', 'cinematography', 'Everything', 'together', 'so', 'neatly', 'never', 'notice', 'timing', 'pacing', 'film', 'are', 'flawless.Conrad', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'Wrestling', 'Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'overlooked', 'gem', 'being', 'somewhat', 'sentimental', 'really', 'delivers', 'Surprisingly', 'was', 'also', 'Happyness', 'believe', 'directorial', 'ineptitude', 'Will', 'Smith', 'weight-throwing', 'were', 'responsible', 'turning', 'thought', 'provoking', 'drama', 'twaddle', 'so', 'saccharine', 'would', 'cause', 'Disney', 'blush', 'chirpiness', 'Happyness', 'almost', 'antithetical', 'weary', 'gray', 'dread', 'Weather', 'Man', 'who', 'do', 'comment', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'call', 'black', 'comedy', 'more', 'properly', 'tragedy', 'scattered', 'comic', 'moments', 'random', 'showers', 'Big', 'Gulps', 'Milkshakes', 'are', 'funny', 'way', 'tragic', 'also', 'when', 'weather', 'man', 'David', 'Spritz', 'Cage', 'splattered', 'route', 'living', 'funeral', 'father', 'bombings', 'remind', 'rain', 'falls', 'just', 'unjust', 'equally', 'usually', 'when', 'least', 'convenient.This', 'film', 'deliberately', 'avoids', 'high', 'drama', 'focuses', 'instead', 'excruciating', 'pain', 'small', 'dramas', 'life', 'David', 'Spritz', 'hardly', 'remarkable', 'marriage', 'rocks', 'real', 'connection', 'children', 'job', 'personal', 'satisfaction', 'sense', 'meaning', 'value', 'father', 'exhausted', 'gentle', 'disappointment', 'financially', 'successful', 'instinctively', 'get', 'everything', 'wrong', 'when', 'attempt', 'be', 'playful', 'snowball', 'estranged', 'wife', 'accidentally', 'face', 'thus', 'breaking', 'glasses', 'Spritz', 'not', 'bad', 'just', 'empty', 'prototypical', '21-st', 'Century', 'man', 'ending', 'give', 'away', 'barely', 'plot', 'director', 'Verbinski', 'masterfully', 'Dave', 'world', 'do', 'feel', 'really', 'exceptional', 'movie.As', 'aside', 'Bryant', 'Gumbel', 'several', 'points', 'film', 'convincingly', 'playing', 'found', 'gratifying', 'see', 'Mr.', 'Gumbel', 'many', 'years', 'sartorial', 'talking', 'head', 'provided', 'positive', 'role', 'model', 'white', 'people', 'America', 'inner', 'city', 'golf', 'courses', 'suburbia']",N/A
962667,AD5OF4QIP4EJ4,B000CSUNQQ,"Amazon Customer ""Sam""","[3, 4]","Gore Verbinski who directed 'The Ring', 'Pirates of Caribbean' does a daring movie to cast a big star to take on realistic theme. He artistically makes us travel into psyche of protagonist creating both comedy and drama with absorbing storytelling.This movie really is a classic character study of suburban man David spritz (Nicholas cage) who works as weather reporter for local TV. We see him with low self-esteem, bit selfish like everyone, anxious, going through mid-life crisis (compare American Beauty) which is brilliantly acted by Nicholas cage. He is successful in career but failing in personal life and desperately tries to fix. The character can be easily identified with many smiling faces in shiny careers with empty lives.Nicholas Cage again proves what a great actor he can be, by taking us into the psyche of realistic characters with great method acting.He probably comes next to Jack Nicholson and Sean Penn in this regard. With his average life skills,he is trying so hard to save his marriage and be a good father of two children. But everything goes against him not only because of his inability but also due to bad luck and timing. We see him as bit perfectionistic who thinks that life is fairy tale.Still we find him very charming,sincere and lovable.We really sympathize with him because he tries his best with no payoff. He is frequently hit with milkshakes and fudges by public on the streets for his erratic prediction of weather in Chicago. His wife is not that bad but just fed up with him and seeking divorce. He tries to build relationship with 12yr dull obese daughter. He also has to deal the crisis with his 15yr son, who is sexually abused by by pedophile rehab counselor. He has ignored his children being workaholic and suddenly tries to fix things by jumping in and showing genuine affection. But alas it doesn't work that way. His father is  award winning novelist appears ""tough yet loving inside' (Michael Caine) is dying with cancer and sees his son's agony all the way. The son is trying hard to live up to father's expectations and approval. His Father is successful novelist with an award but his son is failing miserably. He finally gives advice to him which transforms his outlook of life. ""Easy doesn't enter into grown up life. Learn to chuck in life. There is always looking after"" .Weather man realises that he is playing life just hard. He learns to accept things and finds peace and learns to stand up for himself. He transforms from inside which makes the movie complete. We feel relieved ! In the end, we don't get annoyed with any of the characters. We find them very human, not that bad, yet precariously failing as fate takes over.This movie appears to be a comedy but it has subtle drama for major part. The movie is a honest and brave look into materialistic American culture, involving broken family relationships in funny yet realistic way. The protagonist neglected his family and tries to jump in to fix things and it just doesn't work that way.  ""It may be too late if one doesn't work on relationships from the beginning"" is the message. However the brilliance of the movie is showing how to cope in spite of damage.The movie is shot both mostly in Chicago and New York in breathtaking outdoors involving downtown, lakes and archery spots in snowing winter. We don't see any studio back lots. The Cinematography is great. The music is atmospheric with terrific beats capturing the swinging moods of sincere man. Several motifs - Bow archery symbolic of man trying to focus and get his life right.

He is good at what he does, which is standing in front of a green screen, waving his hands around, and reading what the staff meteoroligist tells him to read, yet he knows nothing more about the weather then what the variable is each day. Meaning how much he can possibly be off the mark. As time goes on, and he progresses further into the depths of middle age, he becomes more consumed in his own thoughts. His family life is a mess ever since his divorce and his father has just been diagnosed with lymphoma with a dire prognosis. Through out the movie he becomes more and more confused about what he is doing with his life and what he wants to do with his job, while also trying to manage his personal affairs.  Being an adult is really not working out for David Spritz.The Weather Man is a very witty and comedic gesture made by director Gore Verbinski. There are times in the film that truly made me laugh more then I have for any other movie in years and truly is a film that makes you laugh out loud. The characther of Dave Spritz plays out like a John Everyman character. Such an average guy, with an average life, and average kids, plays out to be a sort of anti-hero. Not because he's a villan (he is actually quite a decent man), but because of the fact that we can all relate to him. He is insecure and blends in with the crowd just as much as anyone. He never does anything truly heroic, yet you are on his side the whole time because it seems that if he was given a shot, that he could be a hero.Nicolas Cage is perfectly cast as Dave Spritz, as is his father, played by Michael Caine. The relationship between the two seems authentically paternal, with the same awkward affection that all sons encounter with their fathers. One truly special fact about this movie is how family life is portrayed. The interactions and dialouge between Spritz and his family is written very naturally and also delivered well. It is hilarious to watch how Nicolas Cage gives Dave Spritz a sort of awkwardness to everything he says. He is so accustomed to getting everything wrong that he convinces himself he will never get anything right.The Weather Man is a delightful gem of a film that was rather unexpected for me. My expectations for this movie when I first saw the trailers were high, and then dipped down again after hearing some comments about it, and then stabilized. The film itself though is very enjoyable and a true comedy. People love laughing at other peoples flaws, and Dave Spritz is full of them. But you know what they say, it can't be sunny everyday.4/5",4,Bullseye,1143244800,"03 25, 2006",2006,3334,"['Starring', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Dave', 'Spritz', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Robert', 'Spritzel', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'Noreen', 'Director', 'Gore', 'VerbinskiWeather', 'conditions', 'play', 'important', 'role', 'lives', 'daily', 'events', 'occasions', 'revolve', 'ever', 'changing', 'patterns', 'sky', 'TV', 'radio', 'whom', 'tell', 'what', 'expect', 'how', 'prepare', 'weather', 'become', 'staple', 'everyday', 'use', 'have', 'ask', 'do', 'even', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'predicting', 'What', 'happened', 'day', 'could', 'led', 'choose', 'darker', 'lighter', 'attitude', 'forecast', 'Do', 'people', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'talking', 'David', 'Spritz', 'one', 'weather', 'men', 'who', 'rarely', 'have', 'idea', 'where', 'are', 'where', ""'ve"", 'been', 'where', 'are', 'going', 'good', 'what', 'standing', 'front', 'green', 'screen', 'waving', 'hands', 'reading', 'what', 'staff', 'meteoroligist', 'read', 'yet', 'nothing', 'more', 'weather', 'then', 'what', 'variable', 'day', 'Meaning', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'possibly', 'be', 'off', 'mark', 'time', 'further', 'depths', 'middle', 'age', 'more', 'consumed', 'own', 'thoughts', 'family', 'life', 'mess', 'ever', 'divorce', 'father', 'just', 'been', 'diagnosed', 'lymphoma', 'dire', 'prognosis', 'movie', 'more', 'more', 'confused', 'what', 'doing', 'life', 'what', 'do', 'job', 'also', 'trying', 'manage', 'personal', 'affairs', 'Being', 'adult', 'really', 'not', 'working', 'out', 'David', 'Spritz.The', 'Weather', 'Man', 'very', 'witty', 'comedic', 'gesture', 'made', 'director', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'are', 'times', 'film', 'truly', 'made', 'more', 'then', 'have', 'other', 'movie', 'years', 'truly', 'film', 'out', 'loud', 'characther', 'Dave', 'Spritz', 'out', 'John', 'Everyman', 'character', 'average', 'guy', 'average', 'life', 'average', 'kids', 'out', 'be', 'sort', 'anti-hero', 'Not', 'villan', 'actually', 'quite', 'decent', 'man', 'fact', 'can', 'relate', 'insecure', 'blends', 'crowd', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'anyone', 'never', 'anything', 'truly', 'heroic', 'yet', 'are', 'side', 'whole', 'time', 'was', 'given', 'shot', 'could', 'be', 'hero.Nicolas', 'Cage', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Dave', 'Spritz', 'father', 'played', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'relationship', 'two', 'authentically', 'paternal', 'same', 'awkward', 'affection', 'sons', 'encounter', 'fathers', 'One', 'truly', 'special', 'fact', 'movie', 'how', 'family', 'life', 'portrayed', 'interactions', 'dialouge', 'Spritz', 'family', 'written', 'very', 'naturally', 'also', 'delivered', 'well', 'hilarious', 'watch', 'how', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Dave', 'Spritz', 'sort', 'awkwardness', 'everything', 'so', 'accustomed', 'getting', 'everything', 'wrong', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'anything', 'right.The', 'Weather', 'Man', 'delightful', 'gem', 'film', 'was', 'rather', 'unexpected', 'expectations', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'trailers', 'were', 'high', 'then', 'dipped', 'down', 'again', 'hearing', 'comments', 'then', 'stabilized', 'film', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'true', 'comedy', 'People', 'love', 'laughing', 'other', 'peoples', 'flaws', 'Dave', 'Spritz', 'full', 'know', 'what', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'sunny', 'everyday.4/5']",N/A

With The Lord of War, he here adds The Weatherman who, for a good portion of the movie, is a total jerk.  An overpaid weather ""reader"" (he wouldn't know an isobar from a chocolate bar), estranged from his wife and detached and totally at a loss as to what to do with his troubled kids, he has a father who is a famous and accomplished writer(nicely played by Michael Caine, as always)who also happens to be a fine, ethical man, husband and father...something Cage feels he can never equal.  And he is probably right, and the weight of this knowledge has led him to cause all the aforementioned estrangements in his life.How Cage works his way through all of this and comes to a better understanding of his father, his wife, his children and the gist and meaning of his own life is the subject of this film.  It is played with some deft humor, although I would never call this a comedy.A character study, this film benefits greatly by Nicholas Cage's great charm and deadpan delivery.  I can't imagine too many other actors that could engage me playing a guilt-ridden and miserable individual that cannot accept his ""American accomplishment"" while being stubbornly obtuse and inappropriate.

He's the primary reason that I rented this Dvd, maybe the only reason.  Even so, I had high hopes that my little personal rule of thumb (Nick without a gun = good, Nick with a gun = bad) would prove correct with the Weatherman as it had with Adaptation and National Treasure.  His last two roles however, seem to have proven my rule to be unreliable as, well...a weather report.The plot of the Weatherman follows that all-too-familiar structure of Dante's Inferno as our protagonist David Spritz navigates his way through the many circles of hell that we think of as modern life:  ex wife, teenage children, disenchantment with job, discomfort with being a recognizable television personality, general purposeless, the illness of his father.  He confronts and of course eventually learns to overcome the various sins of these other people as well as his personal demons, Wrath and Profanity.  His father serves as the Virgil-like character who guides him though his troubles with a gentlemanly reserve that translates as otherworldly in contrast to the baseness of all the other players in this drama.In general, I liked the performances in Weatherman and I do enjoy the Inferno analogy, BUT....this film was nearly unwatchable.  I do not say that lightly or often.  The plot meandered and seemed to lead nowhere in its own merit; this was almost like a series of random events in the life of one guy with a narration that skipped around just as pointlessly.  When Spritz does eventually resolve his problems, one is left wondering what the fuss was about in the first place.  Furthermore, despite having a certain personal charisma, Nicolas Cage was unable to lend his Spritz character any sort of simpatico; I just couldn't connect with this guy emotionally or intellectually.  I found myself not caring about his annoying, petty troubles with his wife and still not understanding why he hated his easy, high-paying job with such intensity.  So what?

I feel obligated to finish what I start, not to mention losing the hard-earned money I spent on renting a movie or going to the theater and paying up. But I didn't have to turn off THE WEATHER MAN. It was a close call, though. My finger hovered over my remote's ""stop"" button several times.For me, a film has to have some sort of message (be it of happiness, despair, anguish, social/political, family value ...something), but THE WEATHER MAN appears to have none. For those of you who love pessimism, you might find some enjoyment in this flick. But not me. I have a bit more upbeat look on life.I'm actually a fan of Nicholas Cage (loved him in LEAVING LAS VEGAS and LORD OF WAR), but in this film Cage and director Gore Verbinski go over the edge and over the top.Nick Cage plays David Spritz, a weather man for a local Chicago TV station. Living in Chicago and having this kind of a job is not what it's cracked up to be. Illinois' weather is some of the most unpredictable in the nation, going from below freezing one day to 80-plus the next. So David gets picked on regularly by citizens of the windy city (mostly they throw things at him ...like sodas, shakes, hot apple pies, etc.). To add to his sour life, he's in the process of a divorce with his wife Noreen (Hope Davis) and having to deal with his two children who are rushing into adulthood - his 12-year-old daughter smokes and his 15-year-old son just came out of drug rehab. And now, to put icing on the icing, his father (played by the estimable Michael Caine) is dying of lymphoma.All of these terrible things swirl around David Spritz, similar to the unpredictable weather. But all doesn't seem hopeless. He's gotten a job offer on a national TV show (think Good Morning America) but he can't see the good in it. With life in Chicago falling apart, David is ready to shoot somebody. Anybody. Oh yes, did I mention that he's been practicing archery and carries around a bow and arrow now? Don't mess with the weather man.Labeled as a ""comedy/drama,"" the focus is definitely more on the drama than the comedy. Black comedies do appeal to me (I gushed over THE MATADOR), but they need a pretty defined center that an audience can identify with. You're not going to find that here. And it's really a shame, because I felt THE WEATHER MAN could've been an excellent film, but as it stands now it's just a mesh of depressing scenes with no focal point.",1,THE WEATHER MAN IS TOO SOGGY,1142208000,"03 13, 2006",2006,2458,"['lot', 'turn', 'film', 'feel', 'obligated', 'finish', 'what', 'start', 'not', 'mention', 'losing', 'hard-earned', 'money', 'spent', 'renting', 'movie', 'going', 'theater', 'paying', 'up', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'turn', 'off', 'WEATHER', 'MAN', 'was', 'close', 'call', 'though', 'My', 'finger', 'hovered', 'remote', 'stop', 'several', 'times.For', 'film', 'have', 'sort', 'message', 'be', 'happiness', 'despair', 'anguish', 'social/political', 'family', 'value', 'something', 'THE', 'WEATHER', 'MAN', 'have', 'none', 'who', 'love', 'pessimism', 'might', 'find', 'enjoyment', 'flick', 'not', 'have', 'bit', 'more', 'upbeat', 'look', 'life.I', ""'m"", 'actually', 'fan', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'loved', 'LEAVING', 'LAS', 'VEGAS', 'LORD', 'OF', 'WAR', 'film', 'Cage', 'director', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'go', 'edge', 'top.Nick', 'Cage', 'David', 'Spritz', 'weather', 'man', 'local', 'Chicago', 'TV', 'station', 'Living', 'Chicago', 'having', 'kind', 'job', 'not', 'what', 'cracked', 'up', 'be', 'Illinois', 'weather', 'most', 'unpredictable', 'nation', 'going', 'freezing', 'one', 'day', '80-plus', 'next', 'So', 'David', 'picked', 'regularly', 'citizens', 'windy', 'city', 'mostly', 'throw', 'things', 'sodas', 'shakes', 'hot', 'apple', 'pies', 'etc.', 'add', 'sour', 'life', 'process', 'divorce', 'wife', 'Noreen', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'having', 'deal', 'two', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'rushing', 'adulthood', '12-year-old', 'daughter', 'smokes', '15-year-old', 'son', 'just', 'came', 'drug', 'rehab', 'now', 'put', 'icing', 'icing', 'father', 'played', 'estimable', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'dying', 'lymphoma.All', 'terrible', 'things', 'swirl', 'around', 'David', 'Spritz', 'similar', 'unpredictable', 'weather', ""n't"", 'seem', 'hopeless', 'gotten', 'job', 'offer', 'national', 'TV', 'show', 'think', 'Good', 'Morning', 'America', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'good', 'life', 'Chicago', 'falling', 'apart', 'David', 'ready', 'shoot', 'somebody', 'Anybody', 'Oh', 'yes', 'did', 'mention', 'been', 'practicing', 'archery', 'around', 'bow', 'arrow', 'now', 'Do', ""n't"", 'mess', 'weather', 'man.Labeled', 'comedy/drama', 'focus', 'definitely', 'more', 'drama', 'comedy', 'Black', 'comedies', 'do', 'appeal', 'gushed', 'THE', 'MATADOR', 'need', 'pretty', 'defined', 'center', 'audience', 'can', 'identify', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'find', 'here', 'really', 'shame', 'felt', 'THE', 'WEATHER', 'MAN', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'excellent', 'film', 'now', 'just', 'mesh', 'depressing', 'scenes', 'focal', 'point']",N/A

Erland,"[0, 3]","'The Weather Man' is a somewhat slow, often times uneven, totally off-the-wall black comedy that you will either grow to love by the end, or turn off in disgust about forty-five minutes into viewing. There simply is no middle ground with this film.Dave Spritz (Nicolas Cage) is a successful television weather man in Chicago. It is the only thing in his life that is going well. He is separated from his wife (Hope Davis), has two troubled teenage children and a terminally ill Father (Michael Caine) who is still waiting for Dave to act like an adult and straighten out his life.'The Weather Man' is an outrageous tale about one man's search for identity and meaning in 21st century urban America. Dave has lost his way in life, becoming nothing more than the one-dimensional persona seen on the daily weather reports. When Dave finally awakens to the folly of his existence and realizes he has become nothing more than a clown without the costume and make-up he goes on a personal crusade to become the person he once thought he would become. He ultimately discovers how difficult and painful change can be.There is quite a bit of foul language and some really crude comments and situations, but there are also moments of great clarity and insight thanks to the Chayefsky-like screenplay by Steven Conrad. These great moments center around weather man Dave's time alone when he is either walking the streets of Chicago or practicing archery in the park. This on-going interior personal analysis of his failures in life, what he must do to improve his situation and the final acceptance of who and what he is makes this film worth the watch.Definitely not for everyone so be forewarned.",4,"""It's Just Wind, It Blows All Over The Place""",1142121600,"03 12, 2006",2006,1687,"[""'The"", 'Weather', 'Man', 'somewhat', 'slow', 'often', 'uneven', 'totally', 'off-the-wall', 'black', 'comedy', 'will', 'either', 'grow', 'love', 'end', 'turn', 'off', 'disgust', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'viewing', 'simply', 'middle', 'ground', 'film.Dave', 'Spritz', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'successful', 'television', 'weather', 'man', 'Chicago', 'only', 'thing', 'life', 'going', 'well', 'separated', 'wife', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'two', 'troubled', 'teenage', 'children', 'terminally', 'ill', 'Father', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'who', 'still', 'waiting', 'Dave', 'act', 'adult', 'straighten', 'out', 'life', 'Weather', 'Man', 'outrageous', 'tale', 'one', 'man', 'search', 'identity', 'meaning', '21st', 'century', 'urban', 'America', 'Dave', 'lost', 'way', 'life', 'becoming', 'nothing', 'more', 'one-dimensional', 'persona', 'seen', 'daily', 'weather', 'reports', 'When', 'Dave', 'finally', 'folly', 'existence', 'become', 'nothing', 'more', 'clown', 'costume', 'make-up', 'personal', 'crusade', 'become', 'person', 'once', 'thought', 'would', 'become', 'ultimately', 'how', 'difficult', 'painful', 'change', 'can', 'be.There', 'quite', 'bit', 'foul', 'language', 'really', 'crude', 'comments', 'situations', 'are', 'also', 'moments', 'great', 'clarity', 'insight', 'thanks', 'Chayefsky-like', 'screenplay', 'Steven', 'Conrad', 'great', 'moments', 'center', 'weather', 'man', 'Dave', 'time', 'alone', 'when', 'walking', 'streets', 'Chicago', 'practicing', 'archery', 'park', 'on-going', 'interior', 'personal', 'analysis', 'failures', 'life', 'what', 'must', 'do', 'improve', 'situation', 'final', 'acceptance', 'who', 'what', 'film', 'watch.Definitely', 'not', 'everyone', 'so', 'be', 'forewarned']",N/A
962682,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B000CSUNQQ,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[1, 2]","Ignored by the Academy Awards, The Weather Man struck a chord with certain critics and audience members. Pirates Of The Caribbean director Gore Verbinski took the reins of this film which attempts to imitate American Beauty (1999) in its probing dissection of the emptiness of the American pop culture and its emphasis on materialism, fame, and artificially constructed measures of ""success"". Writer Steve Conrad creates a world in which the title character lives in utter emotional depression despite having all the outward ""success indicators"" society craves. Oftentimes funny, The Weather Man is nevertheless a disappointment. The dialogue is often strained, and one leaves with the impression that the film tried too hard to exhibit the symbolism and depth of an American classic. It's ironic, because the very societal acclaim it seems to condemn leads to its own downfall when the film tries to create memorable one-liners and symbolism that just don't work...The Weather Man follows the life of local Chicago weather man Dave Spritz (Nicolas Cage) who lives an ideal life by traditional American standards of success. His salary is in the mid-six figures. He only works two hours a day, and his job requires no thought. He can be right; he can be wrong. It doesn't really matter. Meanwhile, he's been short-listed as a prime candidate for the most desirable weather man job in the world, lead weather guy for Hello America, a nationally syndicated mourning show on one of the major networks. By most people's standard, Dave has it made. But reality is a totally different picture.In Dave's world, he's constantly haunted by his own father's success and his desire to live up to expectations and gain fatherly approval. Robert Spritzel (Michael Caine) is a celebrated American author who won the Pulitzer Prize at age 33, a man respected by almost everyone in the world. But Dave's inability to meet his father's high expectations strains their relationship. In the meantime, Dave and his wife Noreen (Hope Davis) have recently divorced, his daughter Shelly (Gemmenne de la Pena) has taken up smoking and is enduring the pains of teenage adolescence, and his son Michael is the target of a child-molesting counselor. Throw in a bout of a depression due to lack of a substantive life purpose and Dave is really living the American nightmare. But the Hello America job gives Dave a reason for pause as he debates what course his life should take...Snubbed by critics, I'll have to agree that The Weather Man is not the film it held the promise of being. It simply tries too hard to provide deep meaning where a little less flair will do the job. The dialogue is a perfect example. It oftentimes seems that the writers were trying to reverse engineer a sort of memorable dialogue situation similar to the famous ""quarter-pounder with cheese"" exchange from Pulp Fiction. The result is an awkward and tiresome display of such lines as What is that?... It's a frosty... What's a frosty? Why would they hit you with a frosty? The audience is left with the feeling that it's supposed to be captivated by such linguistics, but the result is the exact opposite. Nevertheless, the film is saved by a number of hilarious scenes such as Dave's pathetic attempt at a spontaneous moment when he pelts his ex-wife with a snowball, the innumerable moments when Dave is bludgeoned with fast food, and one exchange of dialogue which does work when Robert defines the term ""camel toe"" for his son. Overall, The Weather Man is a decent night's entertainment, and the film is not completely without value despite its feeble attempt to follow in the footsteps of American Beauty. One just expects more from veteran actors like Cage and Caine...",2,"2.5 stars for this funny, yet disappointing film...",1146182400,"04 28, 2006",2006,3727,"['Ignored', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Weather', 'Man', 'struck', 'chord', 'certain', 'critics', 'audience', 'members', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'director', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'took', 'reins', 'film', 'imitate', 'American', 'Beauty', '1999', 'probing', 'dissection', 'emptiness', 'American', 'pop', 'culture', 'emphasis', 'materialism', 'fame', 'artificially', 'constructed', 'measures', 'success', 'Writer', 'Steve', 'Conrad', 'world', 'title', 'character', 'utter', 'emotional', 'depression', 'having', 'outward', 'success', 'indicators', 'society', 'craves', 'Oftentimes', 'funny', 'Weather', 'Man', 'nevertheless', 'disappointment', 'dialogue', 'often', 'strained', 'one', 'impression', 'film', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'exhibit', 'symbolism', 'depth', 'American', 'classic', 'ironic', 'very', 'societal', 'acclaim', 'condemn', 'leads', 'own', 'downfall', 'when', 'film', 'tries', 'create', 'memorable', 'one-liners', 'symbolism', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'Weather', 'Man', 'life', 'local', 'Chicago', 'weather', 'man', 'Dave', 'Spritz', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'who', 'ideal', 'life', 'traditional', 'American', 'standards', 'success', 'salary', 'mid-six', 'figures', 'only', 'two', 'hours', 'day', 'job', 'thought', 'can', 'be', 'right', 'can', 'be', 'wrong', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'Meanwhile', 'been', 'short-listed', 'prime', 'candidate', 'most', 'desirable', 'weather', 'man', 'job', 'world', 'lead', 'weather', 'guy', 'Hello', 'America', 'nationally', 'syndicated', 'mourning', 'show', 'one', 'major', 'networks', 'most', 'people', 'standard', 'Dave', 'made', 'reality', 'totally', 'different', 'picture.In', 'Dave', 'world', 'constantly', 'haunted', 'own', 'father', 'success', 'desire', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'gain', 'fatherly', 'approval', 'Robert', 'Spritzel', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'celebrated', 'American', 'author', 'who', 'won', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'age', '33', 'man', 'respected', 'almost', 'everyone', 'world', 'Dave', 'inability', 'meet', 'father', 'high', 'expectations', 'strains', 'relationship', 'meantime', 'Dave', 'wife', 'Noreen', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'have', 'recently', 'divorced', 'daughter', 'Shelly', 'Gemmenne', 'de', 'la', 'Pena', 'taken', 'up', 'smoking', 'enduring', 'pains', 'teenage', 'adolescence', 'son', 'Michael', 'target', 'child-molesting', 'counselor', 'Throw', 'bout', 'depression', 'due', 'lack', 'substantive', 'life', 'purpose', 'Dave', 'really', 'living', 'American', 'nightmare', 'Hello', 'America', 'job', 'Dave', 'reason', 'pause', 'what', 'course', 'life', 'should', 'take', 'Snubbed', 'critics', ""'ll"", 'have', 'agree', 'Weather', 'Man', 'not', 'film', 'held', 'promise', 'being', 'simply', 'too', 'hard', 'provide', 'deep', 'meaning', 'where', 'little', 'less', 'flair', 'will', 'do', 'job', 'dialogue', 'perfect', 'example', 'writers', 'were', 'trying', 'reverse', 'engineer', 'sort', 'memorable', 'dialogue', 'situation', 'similar', 'famous', 'quarter-pounder', 'cheese', 'exchange', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'result', 'awkward', 'tiresome', 'display', 'such', 'lines', 'What', 'frosty', 'What', 'frosty', 'Why', 'would', 'hit', 'frosty', 'audience', 'left', 'feeling', 'supposed', 'be', 'captivated', 'such', 'linguistics', 'result', 'exact', 'opposite', 'Nevertheless', 'film', 'saved', 'number', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'such', 'Dave', 'pathetic', 'attempt', 'spontaneous', 'moment', 'when', 'pelts', 'ex-wife', 'snowball', 'innumerable', 'moments', 'when', 'Dave', 'bludgeoned', 'fast', 'food', 'one', 'exchange', 'dialogue', 'work', 'when', 'Robert', 'term', 'camel', 'toe', 'son', 'Overall', 'Weather', 'Man', 'decent', 'night', 'entertainment', 'film', 'not', 'completely', 'value', 'feeble', 'attempt', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'American', 'Beauty', 'One', 'just', 'more', 'veteran', 'actors', 'Cage', 'Caine']",N/A

It sure wasn't for ""Next"" or ""Ghost Rider""!)In this smallish, low key movie, directed by Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean), Cage plays David Spritz, the titular Weatherman. David wears well tailored clothes, drives nice cars, lives in a very nice apartment and has a great job most people would kill for. He also feels miserable most of the time.He is separated from his wife and he can't communicate with his kids, no matter how hard he tries. He dislikes what he does for a living and feels it's a sham.On top of that, the one person he would most like to impress, his father (played by Michael Caine), clearly acts like he believes his son will never grow up or ever amount to anything.In fact, David's life is so off track that when random strangers throw food at him in the street(!) it doesn't seem bother him that much.From what you have read so far, you might have the impression that this is supposed to be some kind of comedy... it isn't. But it's no tragedy either.So if it's neither funny nor tragic, what is it supposed to be?  The only word I can think of to describe it is ... poignantFor example, there is a moment in the movie when his daughter tells him how she got her nickname which I found very touching. Being a father myself it reminded me how heartbreaking it is to not be able to protect your kids against life, but at the same time how easy it is to forget how resilient they actually are. In fact something I loved about the movie is how it portrays peoples' ability to surprise each other when least expected - and even surprise themselves every once in a while!There are quite a few other things I could talk about, but I don't think they will help me convey just how good this movie is.

The Weather Man seems to have come and gone at the box office very quickly. Too quickly. Although it's not a great movie, it is a very good one. Nicholas Cage is fun to watch, and as messed up as his character is, he is likable. Not everyone in the movie thinks so. His ex-wife hates him, his kids and father are baffled by his behavior, and much of his viewing audience disrespects him. Cage's Spritz is a good weather man, but his fellow Chicagoans want to kill the messenger. Rather than actually kill him, though, they take away his dignity in small pieces by throwing fast food at him--tacos, milk shakes, apple pies, whatever. Cage carries a bow and arrow on the cover, because in the film, he uses archery as a way of releiving stress. It seems to help him, though he almost kills his ex-wife's boyfriend at one point with his bow. His archery lessons are a way to defend himself and fight back. The Weather Man, sadly, is not the type of movie to be number one at the box office, because it has no special effects, explosions, car crashes, or super happy ending. It's about real people with real problems. Things are not wrapped up in a nice sitcom bow at the end. Yet, it is often very funny. More of a comedy than a drama. And in the end, the characters, apart for Michael Caine, make out about as happily as could be expected. Cage embraces a slightly warped version of the American Dream. He thinks that success and/or happiness are right around the corner. He is a guy constantly in search of a fresh start. Tomorrow will be the day he gets it together. If he can just get a better job. If he can just find his daughter the right clothes. if he can just buy his dad a cup of coffee, he'll redeem himself a little. The harder Spritz tries, though, the harder he makes things for everybody. He's a human wrecking ball. But by the movie's end, he is perhaps on his way to contentedness, if not happiness.

962690,A2Z0WWM1SNGGCN,B000CSUNQQ,Dana A. Hess,"[5, 9]","""The Weather Man"" is too long, too gray, too depressing for words.  Almost all the ""action"" takes place during a forbiddingly frigid Chicago winter.  There are endless shots of snow and slush and an icy Lake Michigan.  By the end credits I'd lost feeling in most of my extremities.  Nic Cage's character was impossible to sympathize with, and therefore, hard to care about.  All his problems were of his own making, and one couldn't help but wonder how he and Noreen had stayed together long enough to produce their two children.  And, for cryin' out loud, how many divorced couples attend ""trust"" seminars?  Michael Caine is excellent as the over-achieving father figure that the weather man tries to live up to.  Hope Davis is appealing as the exasperated ex who puts up with this whiner for the sake of the kids.  Gil Bellows has a cameo as the counselor who takes pictures of shirtless young boys.  I bet he's glad he ditched that whole Ally McBeal thing for roles like this.  My biggest gripe would have to be the way this movie was presented in the trailer.  It looked almost like a slapstick comedy.  Believe me, it's anything but!

962691,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000CSUNQQ,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[5, 8]","I've never been much of a Nicholas Cage fan, but his performance in The Weather Man has finally put him over the top with me.  From now on, I actually am a Nicholas Cage fan.  I think he turns in a marvelous, make-it-or-break-it performance in this film.  Only a handful of actors could have made The Weather Man work.  It's an unusual film that doesn't really fit into any genre out there - I certainly wouldn't think of it in terms of a comedy.  There's a real indie, certainly dramatic, feel to this whole production; depressing and unsettling, it affects the viewer in an odd, unique way.  I doubt anyone walked out of a theater screening of the film laughing or even talking very much - except for those complaining about how boring the whole thing was.  In all truth, this is a film that will disappoint a significant minority of viewers.  On the other hand, I think many will agree with me that The Weather Man achieves a really weird level of brilliance.This is a hard film to describe.  None of the official or editorial plot summaries come close to capturing the atmosphere and emotional resonance of what takes place.  Dave Spritz (Nicolas Cage) is the very epitome of the angst-ridden adult, a man simply writing in quiet desperation.  None of his dreams have come true, he feels like a total disappointment to his famous author of a father (Michael Caine), he's estranged from his ex-wife (Hope Davis) and increasingly out of touch with his two children, and he just can't seem to get himself together, no matter how hard he tries.  All he has right now (besides an extremely good salary for a weatherman who never studied meteorology) is a long shot chance to turn things around - he's being considered for the job of weather man on the nationally syndicated morning show Hello, America.You have to commiserate with this guy.  Life throws a lot of things at us, but it literally throws things at Dave - soft drinks, food, etc.  (Of course, if he hadn't been driving around freezing Chicago with his window down, he never would have been hit by that Big Gulp drink.)  On top of that, he just can't connect with his kids.  His son has just gotten out of rehab and ends up getting himself into a rather disgusting predicament with one of his counselors (Ally McBeal's Gil Bellows).  His daughter is a twelve-year-old, overweight smoker dealing with a mean nickname she earned by the way she wears her clothes (and it's something I could have done without seeing, let me tell you).  His ex-wife basically hates him, while his Pulitzer Prize-winning father discovers he has cancer.  It is his dad's illness that really galvanizes Dave to try and put things right again - reconciling with his wife, being there for his vulnerable children, getting that big job in New York, and finally doing something to make his father proud of him.  Real life just doesn't work like that, however - and Dave has a hard time dealing with all the burdens that keep falling down upon his shoulders.  Sometimes, he's all but paralyzed with angst, but all of those pent-up emotions can come hurtling out at times, even over one of the little things in life.  He can really be quite emotionally unbalanced, but he never stops trying to change things.  Don't expect a ""they all lived happily ever after"" ending to this story; to its credit, The Weather Man doesn't abandon realism in the film's final moments.What makes The Weather Man a great movie, though, is Michael Caine's remarkable performance as Dave's Dad.  Best supporting actor awards were created for exactly this kind of performance.  Without Caine, The Weather Man is just dark, unusual, and fascinating; with him, it's a surprisingly emotional experience.

He also knows he doesn't measure up and is continually making half hearted attempts at reform that if anything make things worse. Still his heart is in the right place and you empathise with him. By accident he takes up archery and perhaps driven by his father's death does make progress. Some of the best scenes in the movie are shots of the weather and the seasons as they advance on the Great Lakes.

What some viewers did not expect to see - a somber, dreary and grey looking film and the characters that match the film visual palette perfectly. We will follow David Sprith on the streets of Windy City of Chicago during one never-ending rainy and showy winter while he tries to reconnect with his estranged wife, to understand better his 12-years-old daughter and a teenager son and to get closer to his Pulitzer Prize winner father (Michael Caine), ""the national treasure"" by the words of President Carter who is dying from lymphoma. The film explores aging, loneliness, longing, emotional crises, and self doubt and more than once brings to mind John Cheever's observation: ""The main emotion of the adult American who has had all the advantages of wealth, education, and culture is disappointment."" There are a lot of disappointments, regrets and unhappiness in the characters of ""The Weather Man"", especially its main character, David Spritz but the film is not depressing or hopeless thanks to the finesse and artistry of Cage's performance and to his very unique low key dry humor with which he provides the insights in his character's inner world. ""The Weather Man"" is one of the movies that use voiceover effectively and along with Cage, the writer Steve Conrad should be credited for providing the hilarious stream of thought. One of the David's silent monologues, ""Tartar sauce"", is so incredibly funny and masterful that James Joyce himself would've rejoiced had he heard it. Michael Caine deserves equal praise for depth, irony, and a lot of heart that he brings in the role of David's father whose approval David always craved. The last scene between Caine and Cage reminded me of the similar scene between Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in ""The Godfather"" - not because the characters were similar but by its emotional impact and perfect chemistry between two actors.3.5/5 or 7/10",3,"""Easy"" doesn't enter into grown-up life.",1185235200,"07 24, 2007",2007,2738,"['other', 'working', 'actor', 'who', 'would', 'better', 'convince', 'guy', 'lucrative', 'job', 'only', '2', 'hours', 'day', '240K', 'year', 'sort', 'local', 'celebrity', 'quite', 'big', 'considering', 'locale', 'Chicago', 'IL', 'prospect', 'even', 'more', 'spectacular', 'job', 'morning', 'show', 'Hello', 'America', 'NYC', 'may', 'be', 'depressed', 'self-loathing', 'confused', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'role', 'David', 'Spritz', 'TV', 'Weather', 'Man', 'main', 'character', 'Gore', 'Verbinsky', '2005', 'often', 'sad', 'dark', 'frank', 'insightful', 'ultimately', 'funny', 'comedy.I', 'believe', 'movie', 'was', 'grossly', 'mis-advertised', 'trailer', 'pulled', 'clips', 'content', 'give', 'potential', 'viewer', 'idea', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'many', 'laughs', 'come', 'Cage', 'been', 'thrown', 'kinds', 'fast', 'food', 'anti-fans', 'What', 'viewers', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'see', 'somber', 'dreary', 'grey', 'looking', 'film', 'characters', 'match', 'film', 'visual', 'palette', 'perfectly', 'will', 'follow', 'David', 'Sprith', 'streets', 'Windy', 'City', 'Chicago', 'one', 'never-ending', 'rainy', 'showy', 'winter', 'reconnect', 'estranged', 'wife', 'understand', 'better', '12-years-old', 'daughter', 'teenager', 'son', 'get', 'closer', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winner', 'father', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'national', 'treasure', 'words', 'President', 'Carter', 'who', 'dying', 'lymphoma', 'film', 'aging', 'loneliness', 'longing', 'emotional', 'crises', 'doubt', 'more', 'once', 'brings', 'mind', 'John', 'Cheever', 'observation', 'main', 'emotion', 'adult', 'American', 'who', 'had', 'advantages', 'wealth', 'education', 'culture', 'disappointment', 'are', 'lot', 'disappointments', 'regrets', 'unhappiness', 'characters', 'Weather', 'Man', 'especially', 'main', 'character', 'David', 'Spritz', 'film', 'not', 'depressing', 'hopeless', 'thanks', 'finesse', 'artistry', 'Cage', 'performance', 'very', 'unique', 'low', 'key', 'dry', 'humor', 'insights', 'character', 'inner', 'world', 'Weather', 'Man', 'one', 'movies', 'use', 'voiceover', 'effectively', 'Cage', 'writer', 'Steve', 'Conrad', 'should', 'be', 'credited', 'providing', 'hilarious', 'stream', 'thought', 'One', 'David', 'silent', 'monologues', 'Tartar', 'sauce', 'so', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'masterful', 'James', 'Joyce', 'would', ""'ve"", 'rejoiced', 'had', 'heard', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'equal', 'praise', 'depth', 'irony', 'lot', 'heart', 'role', 'David', 'father', 'approval', 'David', 'always', 'craved', 'last', 'scene', 'Caine', 'Cage', 'reminded', 'similar', 'scene', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Godfather', 'not', 'characters', 'were', 'similar', 'emotional', 'impact', 'perfect', 'chemistry', 'two', 'actors.3.5/5', '7/10']",N/A

962700,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B000CSUNQQ,General Zombie,"[8, 11]","'The Weather Man' is a consistently interesting, often rather funny but still bleak and low-key comedy.  Some reviewers have said that this feels more like an independent comedy than a major one, and I see there point, as it is slow and deliberate and often has rather humdrum and realistic tone.  (The characters in the film never realize that this is a comedy, and there really isn't much reason why they would.)  Frankly, I don't think that there are many people out there who are gonna think this is riotously funny, and it is mostly a, well, quiet kind of funny.  (Though this makes the sporadic moments were 'The Weather Man' really goes for the laugh, usually in an offensive or shocking way, all the more effective.)  And, again, it is very morose as far as comedies are concerned.  Still, in the end it is not an overly depressing film and manages to be somewhat life affirming with out leaping to cheap conclusions and easy platitudes.Nicolas Cage is Dave Spritz, the titular weather man.  He's a major figure in Chicago, but he's depressed because he's alienated from his family, thinks that he's a disappointment to his famed Pulitzer prize winning father and just generally feels like something of a phony, being paid so much to do a job so simple, shallow and generally worthless.  The film doesn't have much of a plot arc, the two central concerns being his father's fatal illness and Spritz's audition for a spot on 'Hello, America', a national show which he hopes will save his marriage and give some sort of meaning ot his life.  This kind of naturalistic shapelessness is pretty par the course for this kind of comedy, but it's perhaps taken a bit further than usual here.This is a role we've seen a lot of from Cage in recent memory, a depressed, contemplative man a la his roles in  'Adaptation' or 'Lord of War'.  Fortunately, this is the kinda role that Cage was born to play, and I feel that he's pretty much with out peer when it comes to this sort of thing. (Let's all pray that he never stars in an action movie again.  Who the hell got the idea that Nicolas Cage was an action star, anyway?)  He's a bit more contained here, less quirky and more of a regular guy, but he's still a little weird, definitely .  He's excellent in the film, as usual, and the entire cast is strong.  The film is essentially shown from Dave's perspective, so we never really get to see inside any of the other characters.  He's hopelessly distant from his children; they don't seem to dislike him or anything, they just don't have much to talk about.  Same thing goes for his marriage, and we really don't know why it fell apart.  (This is appropriate enough, as Dave doesn't seem to know why his marriage ended either.  It just did.)  The most significant role in the film other than Cage's is Michael Caine's turn as his father.  He's a little odd as he seems a bit cold and distant initially, but he proves to be a good, honorable man.'The Weather Man' was directed by Gore Verbinski, and this film does little to clarify just what sort of films he has a particular affinity for, if any.  (Previously he's directed 'Mouse Hunt', 'The Mexican', 'The Ring', and 'Pirates of the Caribbean'.) He's already proven he's got great talent for horror and silly summer action-adventure films, and 'The Weather Man' shows that he can handle dark, low-key comedy as well.  The film is never shot in a perfunctory manner, with a very deliberate monochrome color palette, lotsa dull grey, green and blue in the cold Chicago winter.  The film is generally very elegant looking, with a lot of great use of the impressive Chicago architecture and some frozen landscapes.  It's also got a gentle, sorrowful electronic-rock soundtrack.  Very effective.Certainly, this film isn't going to be to everyone's taste.  Not everyone may identify particularly well with Dave because he's something of a jerk much of the time, and I doubt too many people are gonna like this movie if they can't like Spritz.  (But I liked him.)  And it does go long periods of time without any real overt jokes feeding on slight, quirky humor.  Still, it is extremely funny at a number of moments, particularly the aftermath of Dave attempt to mend his marriage by attending a couples counseling retreat plus the repeated motif of him being pelted with fast food and his reflections on just why this happens.  The film generally moves into more serious realms at the end, but it avoids becoming too sappy and doesn't offer cheap solutions.  I think it's believable enough and fairly poignant, allowing Dave to be somewhat more content by the end of the film despite the fact that nothing much has changed.  Many will doubtless find the ending anticlimactic, but that's appropriate enough, I think.Grade: B",4,"Interesting, poignant at times",1140566400,"02 22, 2006",2006,4769,"[""'The"", 'Weather', 'Man', 'consistently', 'interesting', 'often', 'rather', 'funny', 'still', 'bleak', 'low-key', 'comedy', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'more', 'independent', 'comedy', 'major', 'one', 'see', 'there', 'point', 'slow', 'deliberate', 'often', 'rather', 'humdrum', 'realistic', 'tone', 'characters', 'film', 'never', 'realize', 'comedy', 'there', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'reason', 'why', 'would', 'Frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'are', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'gon', 'think', 'riotously', 'funny', 'mostly', 'well', 'quiet', 'kind', 'funny', 'sporadic', 'moments', 'were', ""'The"", 'Weather', 'Man', 'really', 'laugh', 'usually', 'offensive', 'shocking', 'way', 'more', 'effective', 'again', 'very', 'morose', 'far', 'comedies', 'are', 'concerned', 'Still', 'end', 'not', 'overly', 'depressing', 'film', 'manages', 'be', 'somewhat', 'life', 'affirming', 'out', 'leaping', 'cheap', 'conclusions', 'easy', 'platitudes.Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Dave', 'Spritz', 'titular', 'weather', 'man', 'major', 'figure', 'Chicago', 'depressed', 'alienated', 'family', 'disappointment', 'famed', 'Pulitzer', 'prize', 'winning', 'father', 'just', 'generally', 'feels', 'something', 'phony', 'being', 'paid', 'so', 'much', 'do', 'job', 'so', 'simple', 'shallow', 'generally', 'worthless', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'plot', 'arc', 'two', 'central', 'concerns', 'being', 'father', 'fatal', 'illness', 'Spritz', 'audition', 'spot', ""'Hello"", 'America', 'national', 'show', 'will', 'save', 'marriage', 'give', 'sort', 'meaning', 'life', 'kind', 'naturalistic', 'shapelessness', 'pretty', 'course', 'kind', 'comedy', 'perhaps', 'taken', 'bit', 'further', 'usual', 'here.This', 'role', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'Cage', 'recent', 'memory', 'depressed', 'contemplative', 'man', 'la', 'roles', ""'Adaptation"", ""'Lord"", 'War', 'Fortunately', 'kinda', 'role', 'Cage', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'feel', 'pretty', 'much', 'out', 'peer', 'when', 'sort', 'thing', 'Let', 'pray', 'never', 'action', 'movie', 'again', 'Who', 'hell', 'got', 'idea', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'was', 'action', 'star', 'anyway', 'bit', 'more', 'contained', 'here', 'less', 'quirky', 'more', 'regular', 'guy', 'still', 'little', 'weird', 'definitely', 'excellent', 'film', 'usual', 'entire', 'cast', 'strong', 'film', 'essentially', 'shown', 'Dave', 'perspective', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'see', 'other', 'characters', 'hopelessly', 'distant', 'children', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'dislike', 'anything', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'talk', 'Same', 'thing', 'marriage', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'fell', 'apart', 'appropriate', 'enough', 'Dave', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'why', 'marriage', 'ended', 'either', 'just', 'did', 'most', 'significant', 'role', 'film', 'other', 'Cage', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'turn', 'father', 'little', 'odd', 'bit', 'cold', 'distant', 'initially', 'be', 'good', 'honorable', 'man', 'Weather', 'Man', 'was', 'directed', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'film', 'little', 'clarify', 'just', 'what', 'sort', 'films', 'particular', 'affinity', 'Previously', 'directed', ""'Mouse"", 'Hunt', 'Mexican', 'Ring', ""'Pirates"", 'Caribbean', 'already', 'proven', 'got', 'great', 'talent', 'horror', 'silly', 'summer', 'action-adventure', 'films', 'Weather', 'Man', 'shows', 'can', 'handle', 'dark', 'low-key', 'comedy', 'well', 'film', 'never', 'shot', 'perfunctory', 'manner', 'very', 'deliberate', 'monochrome', 'color', 'palette', 'dull', 'grey', 'green', 'blue', 'cold', 'Chicago', 'winter', 'film', 'generally', 'very', 'elegant', 'looking', 'lot', 'great', 'use', 'impressive', 'Chicago', 'architecture', 'frozen', 'landscapes', 'also', 'got', 'gentle', 'sorrowful', 'electronic-rock', 'soundtrack', 'Very', 'effective.Certainly', 'film', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'everyone', 'taste', 'Not', 'everyone', 'may', 'identify', 'particularly', 'well', 'Dave', 'something', 'jerk', 'much', 'time', 'doubt', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'gon', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'like', 'Spritz', 'liked', 'go', 'long', 'periods', 'time', 'real', 'overt', 'jokes', 'feeding', 'slight', 'quirky', 'humor', 'Still', 'extremely', 'funny', 'number', 'moments', 'particularly', 'aftermath', 'Dave', 'attempt', 'mend', 'marriage', 'attending', 'couples', 'counseling', 'retreat', 'repeated', 'motif', 'being', 'pelted', 'fast', 'food', 'reflections', 'just', 'why', 'film', 'generally', 'more', 'serious', 'realms', 'end', 'becoming', 'too', 'sappy', ""n't"", 'offer', 'cheap', 'solutions', 'think', 'believable', 'enough', 'fairly', 'poignant', 'allowing', 'Dave', 'be', 'somewhat', 'more', 'content', 'end', 'film', 'fact', 'nothing', 'much', 'changed', 'Many', 'will', 'doubtless', 'find', 'ending', 'anticlimactic', 'appropriate', 'enough', 'think.Grade', 'B']",N/A

Spritz (Nicolas Cage) and trying reconfigure his life.He try's not to lose control of his life and reconnect with his wife Noreen (Hope Davis) and try to connect and bond with his children and impress his father.Its a touching story of man whose flawed as we are all and that makes mistakes but means well.Its story that really feels real to how sometimes relationships between people go and are.Also the ending of the film ends with a real ending instead of classic Hollywood happy ending.Not that the ending is sad but its realistic.The film directed by Gore Verbinski.The film shows how diverse and quite talented he is as a directed.He has directed a horror film The Ring,a semi comedy The Mexican,an adventure Pirates Of The Caribbean and now The Weather Man.This film felt more like The Ring.Now you will be asking yourself what in common did this have to The Ring.Well ill tell you its not on the topic of the film.Its not horror element.But the look of the film.Both films are dark and grainy with rainy and cloudy days that create a great atmosphere for the characters.Also the second in common is that turns back to little bit more small budget films then the big extravaganza of Pirates Of The Caribbean.All his films have been successful and loved by critics and audiences so his career for now looks its like going to be on the up and up with Pirates Of The Caribbean 2 coming up for him.Also the second good part about this film is Nicolas Cage.When you need a great actor to play a weird character with flaws to add depth to it Nicolas is always the right choice.People have been saying its Terrence Howard's year with Hustle and Flow and Crash.But I also think its Nicolas Cage year as well.With Weather Man and Lord Of War he shows us that he is one of the best acting talents in cinema for me.And in my opinion he doesn't get enough credit sometimes.The DVD will include an English Dolby Digital 5.1 track with a Relative Humidity: The Characters feature, a Trade Winds: The Collaboration feature, an Atmospheric Pressure: The Style feature and a theatrical trailer.From all the extras this film deserves at least a commentary by Gore Verbinski that were not going to get.Probably he is too busy with Pirates Of The Caribbean 2 to do a commentary.I enjoyed this film.This was one of the nice surprises of the year well worth a look.Nicolas Cage and Gore Verbinkski

THE WEATHER MAN was so poorly promoted when it hit the theaters that it seemed like it was going to be one of those asinine food throwing slapstick comedies instead of the very serious examination of contemporary life in the big cities, or even more about the struggle of a disillusioned man who cannot find a balance between business success and family/marital failure, it is. This viewer almost ignored it completely - until the DVD.David Spritz (Nicholas Cage) is a TV pawn the station uses as a weatherman: he is untrained as a meteorologist, skilled only be his TV persona success dependent on a created gag/tag line - the Nipper (the peak worst day in the forecast).  His personal life is a mess, separated from a disconsolate wife Noreen (Hope Davis), distanced from his successful writer father Robert (Michael Caine) and on shaky territory with his two children - fat and sad Sully (Gemmenne de la Pe&ntilde;a) and sweet but troubled pothead Mike (Nicholas Hoult).  To make life worse his TV persona follows him into the streets of blustery Chicago where his viewers either seek autographs invading his privacy or throw food at him as the progenitor of the lousy cold weather.  This polarized existence is invaded by an offer to become weatherman on Bryan Gumbel's Hello America show in New York (a career jump for which he longs for many reasons), serial confrontations with his father whom he emulates but always feels a failure, the finding that his father has lymphoma, the ridicule of fat Shelly at school, Mike's edgy involvement with his drug counselor Don (Gil Bellows), and Noreen's new live-in  Russ (Michael Rispoli).  How David meanders through this quagmire of dilemmas is the story and while it is not pretty, it is pungent.Cage inhabits the strange role of David finding a way to make this loser with a short temper someone about whom we care.  It is a tough assignment but Cage meets it on every level.  Michael Caine provides some of the more eloquent moments in the film: his words of wisdom and view of life are the only grounded elements of the story. Likewise Hope Davis is fine as are the cameo roles of the children as sensitively played by de la Pe&ntilde;a and Hoult.  The subject of the film is tough and the excessive use of potty mouth language is overbearing and at times one wishes Verbinski would have edited some of the gross food slinging scenes.But as an overall message movie there is much here to admire.

Domestic storm clouds hover over David Spritz, (Nicholas Cage), just as he is about to join Bryant Gumbel in New York for a cushy weather position; his overweight daughter is becomiong more distant, (honestly, it was refreshing to see a movie kid, who wasn't a Life Cereal role model), his ex-wife is completely uninvolved in his efforts to reconcile, his son is being seduced by a male teacher, and his famous writer father, (Michael Caine), is dying of cancer. And he's thinking of chucking the whole business aside, and writing dime novels, which apparently he isn't very good at. As he leans toward a higher income bracket, with New York beckoning like an emerald city, he attempts to gather his dependent flock through the stormy weather, all the while questiioning his pursuit of a job he perceives as insignificant and threatening to his life's calling.Like an inaccurate weather forecast, The Weather Man tries to cover too much atmosphere, the amusing domestic traumas don't always collide well with the meandering life philosophies. A one-nighter with a sex bomb seems an afterthought to there not being any sex in the movie, and the son's pedophilic teacher seems offhand and unnecessary melodrama. But it's still a great, fun movie you can't help but become involved in. The daughter's indifferent archery endeavor,(she chooses it as a hobby as if pulling a number out of a hat), is very funny, and the overflow of product endorsement, fast food chains, for instance, all get equal time product displacement, is a subtle and amusing comment forecasting a time when Burger King will be able to place it's logo on the face of the moon.",4,STORMY WEATHER THEN CLEARING,1147564800,"05 14, 2006",2006,1907,"['reach', 'heights', 'cinematic', 'atmosphere', 'deep', 'personal', 'human', 'questions', 'effectively', 'only', 'localized', 'dilemmas', 'comedic', 'pain', 'successful', 'bored', 'Chicago', 'weatherman', 'verge', 'scoring', 'big', 'network', 'TV', 'job', 'Domestic', 'storm', 'clouds', 'hover', 'David', 'Spritz', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'just', 'join', 'Bryant', 'Gumbel', 'New', 'York', 'cushy', 'weather', 'position', 'overweight', 'daughter', 'becomiong', 'more', 'distant', 'honestly', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'movie', 'kid', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'Life', 'Cereal', 'role', 'model', 'ex-wife', 'completely', 'uninvolved', 'efforts', 'reconcile', 'son', 'being', 'seduced', 'male', 'teacher', 'famous', 'writer', 'father', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'dying', 'cancer', 'thinking', 'chucking', 'whole', 'business', 'aside', 'writing', 'dime', 'novels', 'apparently', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'higher', 'income', 'bracket', 'New', 'York', 'beckoning', 'emerald', 'city', 'gather', 'dependent', 'flock', 'stormy', 'weather', 'while', 'questiioning', 'pursuit', 'job', 'insignificant', 'threatening', 'life', 'calling.Like', 'inaccurate', 'weather', 'forecast', 'Weather', 'Man', 'cover', 'too', 'much', 'atmosphere', 'amusing', 'domestic', 'traumas', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'collide', 'well', 'meandering', 'life', 'philosophies', 'one-nighter', 'sex', 'bomb', 'afterthought', 'there', 'not', 'being', 'sex', 'movie', 'son', 'pedophilic', 'teacher', 'offhand', 'unnecessary', 'melodrama', 'still', 'great', 'fun', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'become', 'involved', 'daughter', 'indifferent', 'archery', 'endeavor', 'hobby', 'pulling', 'number', 'hat', 'very', 'funny', 'overflow', 'product', 'endorsement', 'fast', 'food', 'chains', 'instance', 'get', 'equal', 'time', 'product', 'displacement', 'subtle', 'amusing', 'comment', 'forecasting', 'time', 'when', 'Burger', 'King', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'place', 'logo', 'face', 'moon']",N/A

It's refreshing to see Nicholas Cage in the element that he excels best in - serious drama, and with a different hairdo at last.  Armed with a terrific script that goes against the Hollywood grain, this is undoubtedly of Cage's finest performances ever, and one that should have put him up for an award.Cage is David Spritz - the lost Weatherman who has to endure a downturn in life and face his biggest enemy: Himself.  What drives the movie is a powerful script, strong direction, divine cinematography and great acting from all.  Michael Caine is solid as Spritz's strong father, and Hope Davis as the estranged wife mans the dysfunctional family.  Gemmenne de la Pe&ntilde;a plays Shelly, the daughter that Spritz must learn to love.The Weather Man is gripping stuff and not for casual viewers expecting a light film.  Director Gore Verbinski does a great job in making a film about one man's disillusionment quirky yet real.

962707,A2YM2NM7YZA24Q,B000CSUNQQ,Haseeb,"[1, 2]","Very good film.  Funny, poignant and filled with things most of us can relate to.Everything seems to be going so well with Nicolas Cage's character on the surface but in reality, nothing could be further from the truth.  He has a good job but he's going through a divorce and is having problems with his son and daughter.  Also, he has an ailing father.  His father on the other hand, seemed to do so well in life... he's won a pulitzer prize and has stayed married for a very long time.  His main problem is his son (Nicolas Cage) who seems to be so much of a mess up in life (with the exception of his career).So many of us can relate to Nicolas's character Micheal Spritz as a weatherman, if not to him than certainly to his children, wife or father.  Many of the things that happen in this film is mere child's play compared to what people go through every day.  Micheal Spritz did not have a family as dysfunctional as I've seen and experienced but the affects of failing at something in life can be devastating and take years to recover.  We can easily sympathize with Micheal's character and feel some of his pain, but the film was so well made that we didn't feel all that bad because generally after every downer there was an upper.  I liked the dialogue between him and his father and I liked how Nicholas Cage's character delt with adversity (with a few exceptions).  He handled things a lot better than most who are confronted with the same issues.Having a big job with a high income can facilitate certain things in life but it in no way is the key to happiness.

962709,A2HFL26OQJ2T9X,B000CSUNQQ,H. Jin,"[1, 1]","Writing my review of 'Unbreakable' got me thinking about other movies that were butchered by poor marketing. 'The Weather Man' is another good example; the trailers made it out to be a slightly screwball feel-good comedy (with Nicolas Cage getting hit with food and throwing snowballs in his ex-wife's face and such), whereas in fact it is quite a downbeat and serious film. I suppose you could call it a ""black comedy"" or ""dramedy"", but it's certainly not the laugh-fest it was made out to be. It's easy to see why it didn't do well at the box office, which is a pity as I feel this is an excellent and quite distinctive film.At its heart, 'Weather Man' is a midlife crisis put to film. Local weather man David Spritz (Cage) is unhappy with where he is in his life; he is estranged from his wife, feels his career has stagnated, lives in the shadow of his successful father, has difficulties with his children, and his ""fans"" periodically throw food and drinks at him. His attempts to resolve these issues are at different times hilarious, tragic, or both. We cringe at some of his cack-handed efforts (such as betraying his wife's ""trust""), but at other times you cannot help but cheer him on (such as when he deals with his son's counselor). Some might regard Spritz as an unsympathetic protagonist, since alot of his troubles are his own fault, but in reality he is simply human. He makes terrible mistakes and doesn't always learn from them, but his heart is in the right place, and his determination never sags despite a series of setbacks.Nicolas Cage has played these sorts of driven and obsessive characters several times before, and really nails it as Spritz. Cage's lost, hangdog, ""Why Me?"" expression perfectly suits a character who is trying to put something right without fully understanding where it's gone wrong. And Michael Caine has a dignified presence about him as David's dying father, Robert. Despite their attempts to connect, father and son are just not on the same page, and the interactions between them provide some of the films black comedy highlights. Hope Davis also turns in a good performance, getting the right balance of affection, revulsion, and frustration as Spritz's estranged wife.'The Weather Man' is not for everybody, and some may find the blackness of the comedy and the frankness of the navel-gazing a turn off. But if you liked Cage in movies such as 'Adaptation' I think you'll really enjoy this. A different kind of comedy, I would recommend this film for those who like a dark, dramatic, and awkward take on their humour.Four stars.",4,Another very good movie that was sunk by poor marketing.,1275696000,"06 5, 2010",2010,2580,"['Writing', 'review', ""'Unbreakable"", 'got', 'thinking', 'other', 'movies', 'were', 'butchered', 'poor', 'marketing', 'Weather', 'Man', 'good', 'example', 'trailers', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'slightly', 'screwball', 'feel-good', 'comedy', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'getting', 'hit', 'food', 'throwing', 'snowballs', 'ex-wife', 'face', 'such', 'whereas', 'fact', 'quite', 'downbeat', 'serious', 'film', 'suppose', 'could', 'call', 'black', 'comedy', 'dramedy', 'certainly', 'not', 'laugh-fest', 'was', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'pity', 'feel', 'excellent', 'quite', 'distinctive', 'film.At', 'heart', 'Man', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'put', 'film', 'Local', 'weather', 'man', 'David', 'Spritz', 'Cage', 'unhappy', 'where', 'life', 'estranged', 'wife', 'feels', 'career', 'stagnated', 'shadow', 'successful', 'father', 'difficulties', 'children', 'fans', 'periodically', 'throw', 'food', 'drinks', 'attempts', 'resolve', 'issues', 'are', 'different', 'times', 'hilarious', 'tragic', 'cringe', 'cack-handed', 'efforts', 'such', 'betraying', 'wife', 'trust', 'other', 'times', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'cheer', 'such', 'when', 'son', 'counselor', 'might', 'regard', 'Spritz', 'unsympathetic', 'protagonist', 'alot', 'troubles', 'are', 'own', 'fault', 'reality', 'simply', 'human', 'terrible', 'mistakes', ""n't"", 'always', 'learn', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'determination', 'never', 'series', 'setbacks.Nicolas', 'Cage', 'played', 'sorts', 'driven', 'obsessive', 'characters', 'several', 'times', 'really', 'Spritz', 'Cage', 'lost', 'hangdog', 'Why', 'Me', 'expression', 'perfectly', 'suits', 'character', 'who', 'trying', 'put', 'something', 'right', 'fully', 'understanding', 'where', 'gone', 'wrong', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'dignified', 'presence', 'about', 'David', 'dying', 'father', 'Robert', 'attempts', 'connect', 'father', 'son', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'same', 'page', 'interactions', 'provide', 'films', 'black', 'comedy', 'highlights', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'also', 'good', 'performance', 'getting', 'right', 'balance', 'affection', 'revulsion', 'frustration', 'Spritz', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Weather', 'Man', 'not', 'everybody', 'may', 'find', 'blackness', 'comedy', 'frankness', 'navel-gazing', 'turn', 'off', 'liked', 'Cage', 'movies', 'such', ""'Adaptation"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'different', 'kind', 'comedy', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'who', 'like', 'dark', 'dramatic', 'awkward', 'take', 'humour.Four', 'stars']",N/A

Needless to say, I receive a great deal of pleasure reading the reviews of those who vehemently dislike a movie like ""The Weatherman"".One of the great tests I have while watching a movie is when I can completely forget who's playing the lead and become completely absorbed in the character.  Nicholas Cage, as unlikely a weatherman there will ever be, is convincing as a guy who honestly just wants to do the right thing. The fact that this man is living in the shadow of his award winning father makes it difficult for him to see the successes he has already accomplished.

962730,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000CSUNQQ,Kaya Savas,"[3, 7]","MOVIE: The Weatherman is a different type of comedy, it's different because it's a pretty damn depressing film. Our main character, Nicolas Cage, is going through a mid-life crisis and is basically trying to get his life back on track. He has all the money in the world, but just can't seem to function as a person.  He wants to work things out with his wife which whom he is seperated with, and he wants to gain the approval of his father who is an accomplished writer.  He also wants to help his kids be the best they can while trying to be there for them. Nicolas Cage carries the film extremely well, and does an amazing job with the acting.  He plays a weatherman, whose job is to predict the weather, but he can't even predict is own life. It makes sense when we learn later that he doesn't even predict the weather, someone else actually does the work for him and he just reads it from a prompter in front of the camera.  The film is also hilarious in many respects, even though a discussion about his 11-year old daughter's camel toe with his father seemed out of place. While it may have been out of place, it was done in such a way that made me laugh out loud.  The film has excellent pacing, and Gore Verbinski gives us a visual tone to match the emotions of the charatcers.  The film has a very blue color tone to it, it felt like they tinted the film blue just slightly throughout the entire movie.  The cinematography was also top notch.  Hans Zimmer's score also set the perfect tone and feeling for Cage's character. It was a very unique score, consisting of a lot of ticks and tacks to get that nervous twitch feel. When the film becomes sad and depressing he forays into the string instruments, and near the end it remined me very much of his score to The Thin Red Line.  Although our character never really solves his conflict in the end, we do get a sense of closure for him with his past and a door of new opportunity for his future.ACTING: Nicolas Cage does a fantastic job with this role. He also works extremely well with Michael Caine.

962733,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000CSUNQQ,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 4]","I want to observe that Nicholas Cage often plays flawed human beings, but then I thought about it for a second and realized that all actors played flawed human beings.  But with Cage, who even played a flawed character when he literally played an angel, there is always a certain nuance so that we feel the flaws in his characters usually have a sense of tragedy.  Consequently, you find yourself rooting for a character like David Spritz, but you have your doubts.  After all, for every Jack Campbell who manages to salvage his life at the last minute, there is a Roy Waller or Yuri Orlov who might be lucky to break even at best, and of course a Ben Sanderson who goes all the way down to the ground.Dave Spritz is the weather man for a Chicago television station, which means he is already in trouble because Chicago weather is, as a rule, pretty bad, and it changes fast enough that when you get bad weather all of the sudden it is adding insult to injury.  So people throw drinks and food at him, like the weatherman is some sort of communal scapegoat for inclement weather walking down the street.  One of the network morning shows (the one with Bryant Gumble), is sending out feelers and Dave is interested in the gig, but mostly he meditates on the problems in his life.  He is separated from his wife, Noreen (Hope Davis), and seems unable to connect with his children, Shelly (Gemmenne de la Pena) and Mike (Nicholas Hoult).  On camera he smiles, but away from the studio he just wants to be left alone.Dave curses almost as much as if he were being played by Samuel L. Jackson (the acknowledged cinematic king of the cursers).  He does it without thinking, and this is but one of several points on which he is clearly a disappointment to his father, Robert Spritz (Michael Caine, in a wonderfully measured performance), a Pulitzer Prize winning author who uses the elegance of the English language to suggest that whatever his son is doing at any given moment could be done a better way. Even if the words are not precisely ""Son, what are you doing?"" that is invariably the meaning.  Robert is never mean spirited and he obviously cares about his family, but even his gentle words must hurt because they are always of reproach.  However, there is a moment when father and son connect at the last moment, as they are finally able to speak each other's language, as it were.It becomes clear to us that Dave is not going to end up totally happy at the end of this 2005 film from director Gore Verbinski (""The Ring,"" ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl""), but there is reason to hope that he can at least climb out of the rut in which he finds himself.  Granted, walking along the streets with a bow and arrow can make a big difference in a world where people make their displeasure with the weather known by throwing Frosties and Big Gulps at you.  David Spring might not be a rock, but by taking his daughter shopping for some new clothes and laying down the law to the guy who messes with his son, he proves to be much more than shifting sand.",4,The Weather Man learns that easy doesn't enter into grownup life,1140912000,"02 26, 2006",2006,3073,"['want', 'observe', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'often', 'flawed', 'human', 'beings', 'then', 'thought', 'second', 'realized', 'actors', 'played', 'flawed', 'human', 'beings', 'Cage', 'who', 'even', 'played', 'flawed', 'character', 'when', 'literally', 'played', 'angel', 'always', 'certain', 'nuance', 'feel', 'flaws', 'characters', 'usually', 'have', 'sense', 'tragedy', 'Consequently', 'find', 'rooting', 'character', 'David', 'Spritz', 'have', 'doubts', 'Jack', 'Campbell', 'who', 'salvage', 'life', 'last', 'minute', 'Roy', 'Waller', 'Yuri', 'Orlov', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'lucky', 'break', 'even', 'best', 'course', 'Ben', 'Sanderson', 'who', 'way', 'ground.Dave', 'Spritz', 'weather', 'man', 'Chicago', 'television', 'station', 'already', 'trouble', 'Chicago', 'weather', 'rule', 'pretty', 'bad', 'fast', 'enough', 'when', 'get', 'bad', 'sudden', 'adding', 'insult', 'injury', 'So', 'people', 'throw', 'drinks', 'food', 'weatherman', 'sort', 'communal', 'scapegoat', 'inclement', 'weather', 'walking', 'down', 'street', 'One', 'network', 'morning', 'shows', 'one', 'Bryant', 'Gumble', 'sending', 'out', 'feelers', 'Dave', 'interested', 'gig', 'mostly', 'problems', 'life', 'separated', 'wife', 'Noreen', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'unable', 'connect', 'children', 'Shelly', 'Gemmenne', 'de', 'la', 'Pena', 'Mike', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'camera', 'away', 'studio', 'just', 'be', 'left', 'alone.Dave', 'curses', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'were', 'being', 'played', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'acknowledged', 'cinematic', 'king', 'cursers', 'thinking', 'one', 'several', 'points', 'clearly', 'disappointment', 'father', 'Robert', 'Spritz', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'wonderfully', 'measured', 'performance', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winning', 'author', 'who', 'elegance', 'English', 'language', 'suggest', 'son', 'doing', 'given', 'moment', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'better', 'way', 'Even', 'words', 'are', 'not', 'precisely', 'Son', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'invariably', 'meaning', 'Robert', 'never', 'mean', 'spirited', 'obviously', 'family', 'even', 'gentle', 'words', 'must', 'hurt', 'are', 'always', 'reproach', 'However', 'moment', 'when', 'father', 'son', 'connect', 'last', 'moment', 'are', 'finally', 'able', 'speak', 'other', 'language', 'becomes', 'clear', 'Dave', 'not', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'totally', 'happy', 'end', '2005', 'film', 'director', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'Ring', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Curse', 'Black', 'Pearl', 'reason', 'hope', 'can', 'least', 'climb', 'rut', 'Granted', 'walking', 'streets', 'bow', 'arrow', 'can', 'make', 'big', 'difference', 'world', 'where', 'people', 'make', 'displeasure', 'weather', 'known', 'throwing', 'Frosties', 'Big', 'Gulps', 'David', 'Spring', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'rock', 'taking', 'daughter', 'shopping', 'new', 'clothes', 'laying', 'down', 'law', 'guy', 'who', 'son', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'shifting', 'sand']",N/A

First, I thought any film starring Michael Caine and Nicholas Cage was bound to have some good acting, and the trailer strongly reinforced that impression. Second, the trailer also made me think it was a gentle comedy.The first assumption was absolutely right. The second was way out. There are quite a few moments in it which would be funny in isolation, and were funny in the trailer, but in the context of the central character's life I couldn't laugh at them.The film is about Dave Spritz (Nicholas Cage), a weatherman who is the son of a pulitzer prize-winning journalist (Michael Caine) and the divorced father of two teenage children. During the course of the story, he has to come to terms with the death of someone very close to him, the challenges of being a parent, and the aftereffects of divorce.Meanwhile, a steady thread through the story is Dave's bid for a much more prestigious job, while he is regularly brought down to earth with a bump, or distracted from his family duties, when some cretin in the street who didn't like one of his weather forecasts throws fast food at him.In isolation, this may make you laugh. But if you identify with the central character, which Cage's excellent portrayal makes it easy to do, it is no longer funny if someone throws a drink at you and gets a mess all over your coat while you're on the way to collect someone you love from hospital where they are having tests to see whether their cancer is terminal.Michael Caine's character, Robert Spritzel, is a very wise man, who gets some of the best lines in the film, and Caine delivers them superbly. Cage and the supporting cast also act very well indeed. It is a moving film, and a very well made film. But one thing it is not is funny.The only point where I laughed at the trailer, and still laughed in the film, is the vignette which shows Dave walking to work with a five foot longbow and arrows on his shoulder, and you hear his voice saying ""people don't throw things at me anymore - maybe because I carry a bow around."" I think it's a little unfortunate that the trailer and the publicity shots homed in on some of the things which make it look like a funny film because most of it is not, and indeed at points the film threatens to become quite depressing.If you want to watch the kind of film which illustrates one of Caine's great lines in the film - ""Easy doesn't enter into grown-up life"" - go ahead and watch this, and you won't be disappointed.

962739,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B000CSUNQQ,Melissa Niksic,"[19, 26]","""The Weather Man"" is a refreshing film that is emotionally mature and drastically different from the crap Hollywood usually throws at us, but it doesn't develop as much as it could have, which pretty much defeats its purpose.Nicholas Cage plays Dave Spritz, a Chicago weather man who shines in front of the camera but is unable to function in everyday life. His ex-wife doesn't share his desire for reconciliation, his relationship with his kids is shaky at best, and the father he's never been able to please (Michael Caine) has just been diagnosed with a terminal illness. There are moments of humor in this film, but most of it is very depressing. Both of Dave's children are having problems: his daughter is overweight and unhappy and his son is trying to kick a drug habit while falling victim to sexual advances from his counselor. The only thing Dave has going for him is his career: he's up for a national gig doing the weather on Bryant Gumbel's morning news show.

962741,AW99SBGWEXP0J,B000CSUNQQ,Michael Zuffa,"[3, 8]","David Spritz (Cage) is the weathereman on Channel 6 in Chicago.  Well, he reads the weather, someone else does all the predicting for him.  As luck would have it, a national morning show is looking for a new weather man, and he is one of the candidates.  Unfortunately, that is just about the only good thing going on in his life.His marriage to Noreen (Davis) is over, and his inability to trust her is not helping his desire to reconcile with her.  His son Mike (Hoult) is just out of rehab for drugs.  His daughter (de la Pena) has no self-esteem.  Finally, his famous author father, Robert (Caine), is dying of lymphoma, and has always been disappointed in him.  Nothing is going right for David, but maybe getting that national weather man position could turn things around.  Of course, getting that job would mean giving up on his family.  That is a lot for one man to weather.Nicholas Cage is excellent as the poor schlub who has nothing going for him.  His wry narration and embodyment of David show that Cage is at the top of his game here.  Caine is great as the disappointed father that just does not understand his son.  In between filming ""Pirates of the Carribbean"" movies, director Gore Verbinski has churned out a serious look at someone who just cannot get things right.  ""The Weather Man"" is not a happy movie, but it is a good one.  I have a feeling that it will either be loved or hated.

Michael Cain drew me to the movie as he seldomly disappoints - and he did not again even though his role was important rather than all dominant.Nicolas Cage plays a faily succesfull Weather Man on TV where as Cain is his acclaimed Pulitzer Prize winning father. Cage is about to land his big break and possibly be picked as Weatherman on a national TV channel - the pinnacle of what his profession can offer him - with substantial salary and national 'fame' coming with it - but yet he is not feeling a success. He is yearning for his fathers approval but feels he is not accomplishing enough - far from it.As he is moreover separated with two rather disfunctional children the movie follows him struggle to regain his selfworth in a very touching and at times humerous fashion. Cage fits the role brilliantly as did he a drunk in Leaving Las Vegas.... and it seems he should return to these type of roles more frequently. Cage is not typical Hollywood lead, he does not have the looks, the charm or the 'likebility' - what he does have is the anti hero gene, the well intended loser, the nerd etc. all roles he plays naturally with conviction.This movie is more of an art film than a blockbuster and I guess the low ratings mostly come from those among Cage fans who actually like what the rest of us dont i.e. mindless action hero stuff without any cinematic substance or real life people.

He's always very subtle in the dark humor he conveys throughout his characters, and I especially liked him in ""Lord of War"" with his underlying cynicism.This film is a typical Nicolas Cage trademark.  This time he plays a weatherman, divorced, with a son just out of rehab, an overweight daugther, a dying father, and no one seems to really like him.  The movie is basically him trying to turn his life and that of his family around to make his father proud.Cage hits the mark perfectly, as usual.  If you like subtle dark humor, then you'll love this movie...I know I was amused.The only thing is that at times it does tend to run a little slow, and all you want is to turn it off and switch to something with a little more pace.  It also seemed like there was an element missing, the magic that makes movies tic, then I realized it was just that there was no love story, and that's what I loved about the movie...It's real life at it's worst.  There is no happy fairy tale ending, it's just a guy trying to get his life together with his kids and ex-wife, it's not sugar-coated, it's raw...it's life.

He plays a well paid, well sexed and rather boring (and bored)weatherman, going through a mid-life crisis. As the separated father of two children, he has to make do with splitting time with his embittered wife, as well as trying to get along with the kids. It isn't an easy task, and at times it's rather funny. The film does a good job of finding the middle ground between the humor and seriousness of raising two teens in difficult world.What the movie kind of lacks is, ironically, focus. In between all the funny little vignettes and the solid acting, the meaning of the movie either gets lost, or is missing all together. The depiction of the loser, yet successful weatherman as the everyday American is great and poignant. Yet, the movie needs more of an underlying theme. It's one thing to paint a picture of existential crisis. It's another thing to provide an answer or counterpoint to it.Even with this thematic weakness intact, the movie could have been paired down a little more. The archery metaphor was a little stilted and artificial. And it could have focused in on Cage's relationship with his father and maybe one more character. Instead, the movie crams in more like five relationships at once.Other than this, the performances were professional and there is humor to be found for any Cage fan.

962755,A1D3XQC2DIT,B000CSUNQQ,Peter Shermeta,"[0, 2]","Initially I was afraid that The Weather Man would be just like The Family Man, and not just in title. In the former, Nic Cage plays a man with a successful career and an unsuccessful family life. In the latter, Nic Cage plays a man with a successful career and no family life to speak of. The Family Man is about that successful business man realizing there is more to life than his career. And I was afraid I would get that same plot line here, but I didn't. Frankly, the story in The Weather Man was almost the exact opposite.Nic Cage's character is a very good weatherman, but he feels that he doesn't make the people around him happy by being a weatherman, so he overcompensates until he alienates everyone in his life. He hardly knows his two children and struggles to find ways to relate to them. He tries to get back into his ex-wife's good graces, but always seems to screw things up. That made the movie frustrating to watch, but the part played to Cage's personality very well.I read some reviews that praised Cage, but while I thought it was a good part for him, I was not blown away. The movie got progressively better and I think it ended very well and saved what could have been a trainwreck of a movie.As it started out, the movie seemed to struggle within itself. Was it a light-hearted family story as the simplistic writing and short scenes suggested? Or was it a very perverse coming-of-age story with an older-than-usual protagonist where the only thing more prevalent than inappropriate adult situations were f-bombs? These were the two phases to the movie, essentially early and late. Once it moved away from that early phase, The Weather Man was easier to watch. It got better over time, but suffice to say that it isn't a movie I would recommend anyone take a family to see.The Weather Man was a bizarre film, but that ended up being part of the attraction for me. I really liked analysis Cage's character did on himself and there were maybe a small handful of scenes where the writing and direction teetered near genius (primarily the whole inclusion of archery). The movie was flawed -- I won't try to deny that -- but all in all I found it a positive viewing experience. However, I have a hard time seeing anyone liking this movie except 20- 30-something males who are looking for a change-of-pace movie.",3,"It has its merits, but seemed targeted for a small, niche viewer.",1185753600,"07 30, 2007",2007,2331,"['Initially', 'was', 'afraid', 'Weather', 'Man', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'Family', 'Man', 'not', 'just', 'title', 'former', 'Nic', 'Cage', 'man', 'successful', 'career', 'unsuccessful', 'family', 'life', 'latter', 'Nic', 'Cage', 'man', 'successful', 'career', 'family', 'life', 'speak', 'Family', 'Man', 'successful', 'business', 'man', 'realizing', 'more', 'life', 'career', 'was', 'afraid', 'would', 'get', 'same', 'plot', 'line', 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'Frankly', 'story', 'Weather', 'Man', 'was', 'almost', 'exact', 'opposite.Nic', 'Cage', 'character', 'very', 'good', 'weatherman', ""n't"", 'make', 'people', 'happy', 'being', 'weatherman', 'everyone', 'life', 'hardly', 'two', 'children', 'struggles', 'find', 'ways', 'relate', 'get', 'back', 'ex-wife', 'good', 'graces', 'always', 'screw', 'things', 'up', 'made', 'movie', 'frustrating', 'watch', 'part', 'played', 'Cage', 'personality', 'very', 'well.I', 'read', 'reviews', 'praised', 'Cage', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'part', 'was', 'not', 'blown', 'away', 'movie', 'got', 'progressively', 'better', 'think', 'ended', 'very', 'well', 'saved', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'trainwreck', 'movie.As', 'started', 'out', 'movie', 'seemed', 'struggle', 'Was', 'light-hearted', 'family', 'story', 'simplistic', 'writing', 'short', 'scenes', 'suggested', 'was', 'very', 'perverse', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'older-than-usual', 'protagonist', 'where', 'only', 'thing', 'more', 'prevalent', 'inappropriate', 'adult', 'situations', 'were', 'f-bombs', 'were', 'two', 'phases', 'movie', 'essentially', 'early', 'late', 'moved', 'away', 'early', 'phase', 'Weather', 'Man', 'was', 'easier', 'watch', 'got', 'better', 'time', 'suffice', 'say', ""n't"", 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'take', 'family', 'see.The', 'Weather', 'Man', 'was', 'bizarre', 'film', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'part', 'attraction', 'really', 'liked', 'analysis', 'Cage', 'character', 'did', 'were', 'maybe', 'small', 'handful', 'scenes', 'where', 'writing', 'direction', 'teetered', 'genius', 'primarily', 'whole', 'inclusion', 'archery', 'movie', 'was', 'flawed', 'wo', ""n't"", 'try', 'deny', 'found', 'positive', 'viewing', 'experience', 'However', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'seeing', 'anyone', 'liking', 'movie', '20-', '30-something', 'males', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'change-of-pace', 'movie']",N/A
962756,AXV9GS0TMSVW,B000CSUNQQ,Poor Napoleon,"[3, 5]","The Weather Man is not a movie in the traditional sense.  David Spritz is not a traidtional protagonist, pitted against some struggle that he will eventually overcome.  Rather, from the beginning, we see that his life is a never ending struggle.  His marriage has failed.  He lives in the shadow of his much more successful father and his children are growing distant, as they deal with their own troubles.The makers of this film could have easily made this somewhat formulaic, with Cage's character learning from his mistakes and becoming a better human being because of that.  Ultimately, at the end, he may have learned something.  That is for the viewer to decide.  Along the way though, we clearly see through Cage's sparse narrations and his interactions with the people around him that he lives in an illusion, cotinually making vain attempts to please his father and win over his ex-wife and children.The Weather Man does not follow a typical film narrative.  Rather, we follow Cage's Spritz through as he stumbles, rises a bit, and falls much more.  Writer Steven Conrad and director Gore Verbinski are interested in how Spritz fails and why he thinks the way he does.  That the film follows Spritz so closely causes us to root for him in spite of his failures.This is a beautiful, overlooked character study that many people turned their back on during its initial release.  It's Cage at his best.  It's Cage doing low self esteem as he did so well in Adaptation.  The character is very human, and while the situations in the film may not ring true with every viewer, there's a part of Spritz that all of us grapple with at one time or another.",4,Like watching a train wreck,1140566400,"02 22, 2006",2006,1654,"['Weather', 'Man', 'not', 'movie', 'traditional', 'sense', 'David', 'Spritz', 'not', 'traidtional', 'protagonist', 'pitted', 'struggle', 'will', 'eventually', 'overcome', 'Rather', 'beginning', 'see', 'life', 'never', 'ending', 'struggle', 'marriage', 'failed', 'shadow', 'much', 'more', 'successful', 'father', 'children', 'are', 'growing', 'distant', 'deal', 'own', 'troubles.The', 'makers', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'made', 'somewhat', 'formulaic', 'Cage', 'character', 'learning', 'mistakes', 'becoming', 'better', 'human', 'being', 'Ultimately', 'end', 'may', 'have', 'learned', 'something', 'viewer', 'decide', 'way', 'clearly', 'see', 'Cage', 'sparse', 'narrations', 'interactions', 'people', 'illusion', 'cotinually', 'making', 'vain', 'attempts', 'please', 'father', 'win', 'ex-wife', 'children.The', 'Weather', 'Man', 'not', 'follow', 'typical', 'film', 'narrative', 'Rather', 'follow', 'Cage', 'Spritz', 'bit', 'much', 'more', 'Writer', 'Steven', 'Conrad', 'director', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'are', 'interested', 'how', 'Spritz', 'why', 'way', 'film', 'Spritz', 'so', 'closely', 'root', 'spite', 'failures.This', 'beautiful', 'overlooked', 'character', 'study', 'many', 'people', 'turned', 'back', 'initial', 'release', 'Cage', 'best', 'Cage', 'doing', 'low', 'self', 'esteem', 'did', 'so', 'well', 'Adaptation', 'character', 'very', 'human', 'situations', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'ring', 'true', 'viewer', 'part', 'Spritz', 'grapple', 'one', 'time']",N/A

962761,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B000CSUNQQ,RMurray847,"[5, 9]","This is one of those movies that was pretty much doomed from the start.  Everyone works really hard, and the actors all do nice work...but whoever agreed that this script would make a good movie made a huge mistake.  And director Gore Verbinski (who has done good work in THE RING and PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN) should NOT have allowed himself to take this on.It follows the story of a successful TV Weatherman (Nicholas Cage) and his incredible ineptness at all other aspects of his life.  He was a lousy husband, a loving but ineffective father, a disappointing son, a lousy writer and in general an all around loser.  The movie is about, not his slow journey to redemption, but his eventual acceptance of the poor person he is.  I suppose the idea of coming to accept ones considerable shortcomings might be a worthwhile thing in ""real"" life, but it does not make for a satisfying movie.I've read this before about THE WEATHER MAN, but it seems apt.  The movie's themes are those you might see in a small, indie film.  Something like THE SECRET LIVES OF DENTISTS or BROKEN FLOWERS.  A movie about tone and mood.  A movie about ""real"" people who accomplish small things, celebrate tiny victories and are defeated by mundane occurrences.  THE WEATHER MAN shows how a typical, glossy Hollywood treatment of truly mundane subjects somehow creates a disconnect.  Our very movie-going systems are primed expect something more, something grander when we see a big budget splashed on the screen.  It's ridiculous, I know.  In some ways, that isn't the fault of the movie-makers.  But it is a real phenomenon.  How can great actors and stars like Nicholas Cage and Michael Caine, surrounded by lush cinematography, crisp images, slick editing and all the trappings of ""big budget"" manage to accomplish so little in the way of satisfying storytelling?I don't mind movies with bleak endings, or even with no real endings at all (again, I point to BROKEN FLOWERS).  But what does bother me is that the movie also doesn't seem to know its point.  Cage's character is clearly very successful at his chosen career.  He is even offered the equivalent of Al Roker's job...that's pretty much the pinnacle for a weather man, isn't it.  Yet Cage takes no pride in his position.  Nor does anyone else.  His father, a successful and well-loved author (Caine) seems mostly perplexed by television.  His ex-wife (the excellent Hope Davis), who tries to remain his sympathetic friend, doesn't give him much more than a ""that's nice,"" even though he's about to pull down over $1,000,000 a year, plus endorsements.  Is the movie saying we shouldn't take pride in material successes?  Maybe that would be valid, except we are forced to watch Cage trying to a) connect with his ex, b) connect with his overweight daughter, c) connect with his drug-using teenage son, d) connect with his father and e) connect with himself.  He appears to be a failure as a human.  Is that because he's so successful?  Or is he so empty as a real person that the ""plastic"" smile of the meteorologist comes so naturally to him that he MUST succeed at this?As I mentioned, the acting is generally good...although Cage does have that nasally voice and drooping demeanor that sometimes I swear his character seems mentally challenged.  And sometimes the script turns him into such a loser, you almost feel bad for the actor.  Can't the poor man be allowed to excel at anything?  And at other times, he's so self-defeating, you just want to smack him!  Caine is very good, but his character isn't terribly likeable.  He berates his son constantly, but where's the love?  The young actors playing the kids are fine as well...it's nice to see Nicholas Hoult (from ABOUT A BOY)...doing an American, no less.  Gil Gerard has a small, but effectively creepy role.  Hope Davis is always good.But it all amounts to almost nothing.  I'm not sure the writer and director quite knew what they were trying to say...so they threw all sorts of stuff in as though they hoped something would stick.  Things stuck, alright, but it was mostly yucky.I can't recommend this movie.

Zwick,"[1, 3]","***1/2David Spritz is a Chicago TV weatherman whose life has become as imprecise and unpredictable as the forecasts he delivers to the often skeptical masses who watch his show (he is quick to point out that he is no certified meteorologist).  And if his life could be summed up in one of those forecasts, it would be ""Mostly cloudy with a chance of heavy showers.""When he was younger, Dave had visions of how his life would turn out, but somehow those visions never managed to materialize.  A failure as both a husband and a father, he is currently divorced from his ex-wife, Noreen, and has a teenage son in rehab and an overweight daughter with a poor self image both of whom Dave is trying desperately to make a connection with.  He also has on overly critical father (Michael Caine) who has recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer.  As a weather forecaster, Dave also has to suffer the recurrent indignity of being a second tier ""celebrity,"" which manifests itself in total strangers throwing fast food products at him whenever he is out walking the streets - an obvious metaphor for his life.Written by Steve Conrad and directed by Gore Verbinski, ""The Weather Man"" is not for all tastes and audiences, but those with an appreciation for subtle black humor may find themselves drawn to its themes.  It provides a subdued portrait of a man who seems unable to take control of the elements of his life and, thus, finds his world splintering apart in many different directions.  Part of the problem comes from the feeling of inadequacy instilled in him by his father, an inadequacy that prevents Dave from assuming the responsibilities that an adult must in order to fulfill his role as a productive member of society.  For Dave is the first to admit that his job is a mere sinecure and that he's made a genuine mess of his marriage and family life through his lack of focus and tendency towards fear and inaction.  The sullen mood, reflected in the stark wintry chill of the Chicago setting, lends a gravity to the film's wry, offbeat humor.Although we've seen Cage in this sad sack, victim-of-circumstances role before, he does a nice job here making Dave empathetic without turning him into a sap.  There are fine turns too from Hope Davis as Noreen, Gemmenne de la Pena as his daughter, Nicholas Hoult (the ""boy"" in ""About a Boy"") as his son and Caine as the father who can still make David's self image wither under his pointed but ever-so-subtle criticism.  The movie doesn't go in for grand speechifying or neatly tied-up resolutions, preferring instead to see life for the absurdly unpredictable and jumbled mess it truly is.The one genuinely sour note in the film is struck by the presence of a rehab counselor who attempts to seduce Dave's 15-year-old son into having sex with him.

962768,ACTYP447JCDX0,B000CSUNQQ,Scott Bresinger,"[1, 2]","""The Weather Man"" was probably aiming to be a prototypical fall-released ""prestige"" picture and hopeful Oscar-bait.  This tale of a professionally successful weatherman (Nicolas Cage) at a Chicago TV station whose personal life is in shambles has a quirky, tragicomic feel and a supporting cast (including Michael Caine and Hope Davis) that screams ""Quality production.""  It never once veers into cheap sentimentality (though Steven Conrad's script presents plenty of opportunities), and it almost always holds your attention.  It's also one of the best films of director Gore Verbinski's career, although a career that includes ""The Ring"" and ""Pirates of the Carribean"" doesn't really suggest High Art (I did actually like ""The Mexican"" with Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts, though).  Unfortanately, it also tries very hard to be in the same league with ""American Beauty"" and ""About Schmidt"" and comes up way shortNicolas Cage does a fine, understated job and Michael Caine is, as usual, spectacular.  Problem is, while the script wants us to see Cage's Dave Spritz as a man in existential turmoil, it's really just a midlife crisis, and not a particularly original one at that.  Yeah, his wife has left him and resists any attempt at a reconciliation.  He can't connect with his two children.  He learns his father, an acclaimed and legendary novelist, is dying.  His job,which gives him a huge financial reward for very little effort, leaves him feeling empty--not to mention the fact that peeved viewers constantly throw fast food at him.  Basically, he's a guy who feels he can never do anything right and won't really amount to anything in the long run.  Well, get in line, Dave!  It's hard to feel much sympathy for the guy, even if many people can empathize.  Although the film resists most temptation to make a grand and obvious statement, it's loaded down with symbolism that is very obvious.  Can Dave's sudden interest in archery be anything other than an attempt to control his destiny and finally hit the mark?While I definitely applaud the effort--it's way better than most of the monochromatic sludge vomited forth from mainstream Hollywood--I just can't help but feel underwhelmed.  So the outlook for ""The Weather Man"" is partly uplifting, with clouds of mediocrity creeping in.  Sorry, I just couldn't resist a silly weather metaphor.

Nicholas Cage plays a character that is supposed to be a weather man, but more enough this movie should have been called the problem man, in fact we are supposed to believe that he works 2 hours a day. This movie seems to be more about his personal problems then a weather man, people throw fast food at him, he is dirvoced from his wife, his kids are supposed to be hating him, and well one is fat, and that is his 12 year old daugther, well his 15 year old son sees a counselor, and how must he feel. The few stations scenes that we do see in this movie was filmed at WGN TV, and thier chief Meterologist Tom Skilling served as techonial advisor, and I have a warning for Tom Skilling fans, don't get this movie thinking that you are going to see him in this movie, bveause you are not, if what ever scene(s) he filmed for this movie was cut, and in less he is a really good disquise. Dave Spritz (Nicolas Cage) works as a weather man in the city of Chicago, and works a 2 hour day, but sceens that we do see, he narrates over the secens he is seen working. But his ""personal"" life is more of a mess, to start with he is dirvoced from his wife (Hope Davis). His daughter (Gemmenne de la Pe&ntilde;a) is not only overweight, but also depressed, and his 15 year old son (Nicholas Hoult) spends his time seeing a counselor (Gil Bellows) for rehab. And his dad Robert Spritzel (Michael Caine), is a Pulitzer-winning writer, who early in the movie gets cancer, and we see then spendtying time in the lobby of a doctor's office. And Dave is up on a list for a national show as a weather man that is hosted by Bryant Gumbel, and Anne Marie Howard serves as his co-anchor. One thing that they could have done, is cut out some of his perssonal problems, that should remain that way, and show him more during the weather, even through he stands in front of a green weather, but because of the magic of the news, people don't see that, instead they see weather maps behind him, but he sees them in montors. There are even secenes that we see him spednting time with his daughter by during archry, which is totally of the subject of this movie, and maybe a few other parts that could have been cut to make it better, but this is just what we will have to get.",4,More like the problem man,1149638400,"06 7, 2006",2006,2544,"['Here', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'city', 'Chicago', 'might', 'like', 'say', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'more', 'filmed', 'Chicago', 'well', 'lot', 'where', 'back', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'now', 'Chicago', 'list', 'movie', 'making', 'are', 'few', 'problems', 'are', 'do', 'have', 'movie', 'Cage', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'weather', 'man', 'more', 'enough', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'problem', 'man', 'fact', 'are', 'supposed', 'believe', '2', 'hours', 'day', 'movie', 'be', 'more', 'personal', 'problems', 'then', 'weather', 'man', 'people', 'throw', 'fast', 'food', 'dirvoced', 'wife', 'kids', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'hating', 'well', 'one', 'fat', '12', 'year', 'old', 'daugther', 'well', '15', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'counselor', 'how', 'must', 'feel', 'few', 'stations', 'scenes', 'do', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'WGN', 'TV', 'thier', 'chief', 'Meterologist', 'Tom', 'Skilling', 'served', 'techonial', 'advisor', 'have', 'warning', 'Tom', 'Skilling', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'movie', 'thinking', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'ever', 'scene', 's', 'filmed', 'movie', 'was', 'cut', 'less', 'really', 'good', 'disquise', 'Dave', 'Spritz', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'weather', 'man', 'city', 'Chicago', '2', 'hour', 'day', 'do', 'see', 'secens', 'seen', 'working', 'personal', 'life', 'more', 'mess', 'start', 'dirvoced', 'wife', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'daughter', 'Gemmenne', 'de', 'la', 'Pe', 'ntilde', 'not', 'only', 'overweight', 'also', 'depressed', '15', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'time', 'seeing', 'counselor', 'Gil', 'Bellows', 'rehab', 'dad', 'Robert', 'Spritzel', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Pulitzer-winning', 'writer', 'who', 'early', 'movie', 'cancer', 'see', 'then', 'spendtying', 'time', 'lobby', 'doctor', 'office', 'Dave', 'up', 'list', 'national', 'show', 'weather', 'man', 'hosted', 'Bryant', 'Gumbel', 'Anne', 'Marie', 'Howard', 'co-anchor', 'One', 'thing', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'cut', 'out', 'perssonal', 'problems', 'should', 'remain', 'way', 'show', 'more', 'weather', 'even', 'front', 'green', 'weather', 'magic', 'news', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'instead', 'see', 'weather', 'maps', 'montors', 'are', 'even', 'secenes', 'see', 'spednting', 'time', 'daughter', 'archry', 'totally', 'subject', 'movie', 'maybe', 'few', 'other', 'parts', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'make', 'better', 'just', 'what', 'will', 'have', 'get']",N/A

His job is a sham and he knows it. Weather prediction is, at best, a crap shoot and he never even studied meteorology; thus he is an unqualified, overpaid ""guesser"" who is frequently wrong.Formerly married, he took his wife and family for granted, forgot the tartar sauce (watch it and see), and now deeply regrets their loss. His naive, pathetic attempts to regain the respect of his wife and family have the opposite effect. His own children find his constant lame attempts at fatherhood to be a bit annoying. His father, a hugely successful author, is continuously but politely disappointed in his son.He has no self respect, and consequently receives no respect; indeed, viewers frequently pelt him with fast food, so appropriate for its total lack of substance. In short, he is the sad sack, self-loathing loser that Nicholas Cage frequently portrays.So why would anyone want to spend time watching this depressing scenario?1) Although not a comedy, there are intensely comedic moments throughout, made even more humorous by contrast with the pathos.2) Wonderful, well-presented dialog. Each word is carefully chosen and excellent, thoughtful points are often made.3) Who among us has not experienced some, if not all, of these feelings? Are you thrilled with your job? Have you ever been a less than perfect spouse or parent? Do (or did) you enjoy the full respect of your father? Is your life a little less than you had hoped for?For those who have lived an imperfect life, this movie will hit a lot of nails on the head, and for that reason I recommend it. It is not a comedy.

It's nice to know big screen actors such as Nicholas have the time and heart to think of the not-so-big-screen presenters.And what sort of movie is 'The Weatherman' anyway? Sure, it's a run-of-the-mill family drama, the usual fluff about 'changing my life', with the fat daughter who smokes, the vulnerable teenage son and an ex-wife who hates him no matter what. As you do. Or, as one wise viewer noted; 'Why is Nicholas Cage SO DESPERATE to make you believe weather reporters have such terrible lives?' Yet, no matter how many times you see taco's and milkshakes thrown at him from cars, you just don't feel sorry for him. In fact, the more whiny his voice-overs become, the more you want to see him get hit with those milshakes. But Chicago must be a cool place - 'poor' people throw stuff out of car windows at weather reporters; anywhere else in the world that's against the law. Or, more importantly, they wouldn't even recognise 'the weatherman'.But then there's the OTHER side to 'The Weatherman' - what with all those slow-motion scenes of him wandering throught the streets of New York with a bow and arrow, a world where Spongebob is some sort of admired hero, forever having parades given in his honour, and, if that wasn't enough, having Cages' characters dad played by Michael Caine, British accent fully in tact. Maybe this is some late-60's-inspired psychedelic gem.So how come it's worth as much as 5 / 10? Well, if it isn't kind of interesting, it sure tries hard to pretend it is - those parental chats, the well-adjusted son who deals with adversity much better than his father deals with minor inconveniences. Then there's Nicholas Cage, who is ever-earnest as always, truly the doting dad, and truly seems to love his ex-wife, despite some cheating in fancy-dress.Ah well, get it if you must, though sometimes you get the feeling the people who made this movie wanted to make a real stinker -a movie so bad and rediculous, just so they could laugh at how bad it was; you know, people with lots of money and lots of time on their hands (and, apparently, a lack of creativity and good ideas).

962779,A2NVQZ4Y7Y0J1R,B000CSUNQQ,Traveler,"[7, 10]","The number one problem with ""The Weather Man"" isn't the movie, it's the marketing.  Everyone who saw the previews thought they were going to see a comedy.  I'm not sure what this means - are the studios skeptical that people will go to a drame/dark comedy that talks about the meaning of life?  Or were they too stupid to know what they had?The reviewers arguing against the movie because it's not a comedy are making a reductionist argument.  So it's not x, it's y.  If you're open to what ""The Weather Man"" really is you'll find something true and meaningful.Nicolas Cage plays a man, David Spritz, who thinks he's nothing and the world treats him that way.  His ex-wife, his father, his viewers who throw various food items at his head.There are so many scenes that have huge meaning beyond the obvious.  My favorite was when Spritz is discussing the forecast with a real meteorologist (Spritz is really just a high paid weather report reader) who's trying to explain a huge variance in the likely temperature.  Spritz argues that he can't go on TV and  give a report that's so vague.  The meteorologist explains that that's way things are sometimes and you don't know what's going to happen.  This point isn't driven home to the viewer, but it slowly settles in.  Part of Spritz's problem is his desire to try to control what he cannot control and accept this as life.Other viewers will undoubtedly have their own favorite scenes.  Michael Caine, who plays Cage's father, has several lines that are equally profound.As I was watching this movie I did have a growing dread that the director was just going to humiliate Spritz in every way and leave us with a totally crushed man at the end.  I even had to turn away from the screen a few times as I antipcated more and more blows to his ego.  But that's not how the movie ends.  Spritz doesn't get nearly everything he wants.  But he does learn to appreciate what he has.

Off-beat and existential. Or instead of existential, you may say thought-provoking, spiritual or philosophical if you like. So many monologues done by the protagonist tells you about his life or his own views on life, which looks sometimes contradictory to what is really happening around him. But you know, he is a weather man; he may be just reading what is on the prompter. He just does not know what he is saying. Or maybe I am wrong.On the surface of it `The Weather Man' is a film about a Chicago weather man David Spritz (Nicholas Cage) whose real personality and best intentions are all ignored or worse, misunderstood by his separated wife Noreen (Hope Davis), his daughter, his father (Michael Caine), and some of the passers-by who throw a piece of pie, or cup full of juice and shake at him in the street. And there must be some meanings behind them, right? But again, maybe I am wrong.To follow the story is probably meaningless. The film is all about David, or the weather man. For a film from a major studio, it is a brave decision. And the protagonist is not always a likable person. David sometimes makes a fool of himself, and that happens not in the way that would make all of you laugh. Some of the embarrassing situations he experiences are surely realistic, like when you try to impress someone, and end up with making him/her angry. David does that several times, and yes, the results are pretty funny, but like a bad weather, this happens to anyone. They're well-crafted vignettes, and nothing more.His ailing father, respected prize-winning writer played effectively by Michael Caine, does not look ill, and keeps calm attitudes throughout. He even doesn't look suffering anything - he is much calmer than his son David, to whom he says: 'Easy' doesn't enter into grown-up life."" In fact, David's life is full of `easy' - except his family life - and he kind of accepts his `easy' after all like the Sponge Bob balloon floating in the air, but I for one could not find anything substantial or meaningful in the portrait of David or Bob.The film reminded me of `American Beauty' slightly overrated film about a middle-aged person's life in America, which is much darker than this one. Frankly I hated that film, but at least Kevin Spacey's character made a point in showing the utter bleakness of what he attempts to do. `The Weather Man' is a bit lighter in tone, and I like that part. But I still could not see the point of the film except that it is about life's unbearable lightness and the ridiculousness of our existence.Or if the film wants to say you cannot predict your life, it has made the point. To most of the viewers watching the film, however, this is no news. We need more original ways of presenting this old news, and more insightful episodes than the ones about archery, child abuse, an estranged wife and a daughter, and a morose weather man.Some other director might have done that, but not Gore Verbinski, who does not have his own voice. In such films as `Pirates of the Caribbean,' `The Ring' `The Mexican' and `Mousehunt,' it was still OK. The fine stars did the job. In the film like this, where the filmmaker's views on life are presented and examined, he shows nothing but his desperate will to make the film quirky and unconventional. Sad thing is, he is also good at that.",2,Pretentious Film To Be Admired with Some Message: And What Is the Message Anyway?,1166659200,"12 21, 2006",2006,3495,"['call', 'off-beat', 'comedy', 'existentialist', 'drama', 'may', 'be', 'easy', 'choice', 'words', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'ones', 'think', 'watching', 'Weather', 'Man', 'Off-beat', 'existential', 'instead', 'existential', 'may', 'say', 'thought-provoking', 'spiritual', 'philosophical', 'like', 'So', 'many', 'monologues', 'done', 'protagonist', 'life', 'own', 'views', 'life', 'sometimes', 'contradictory', 'what', 'really', 'happening', 'know', 'weather', 'man', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'reading', 'what', 'prompter', 'just', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'saying', 'maybe', 'am', 'surface', 'Weather', 'Man', 'film', 'Chicago', 'weather', 'man', 'David', 'Spritz', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'real', 'personality', 'best', 'intentions', 'are', 'ignored', 'worse', 'misunderstood', 'separated', 'wife', 'Noreen', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'daughter', 'father', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'passers-by', 'who', 'piece', 'pie', 'cup', 'full', 'juice', 'shake', 'street', 'must', 'be', 'meanings', 'right', 'again', 'maybe', 'am', 'wrong.To', 'follow', 'story', 'probably', 'meaningless', 'film', 'David', 'weather', 'man', 'film', 'major', 'studio', 'brave', 'decision', 'protagonist', 'not', 'always', 'likable', 'person', 'David', 'sometimes', 'fool', 'not', 'way', 'would', 'make', 'laugh', 'embarrassing', 'situations', 'are', 'surely', 'realistic', 'when', 'try', 'impress', 'someone', 'end', 'up', 'making', 'angry', 'David', 'several', 'times', 'yes', 'results', 'are', 'pretty', 'funny', 'bad', 'weather', 'anyone', ""'re"", 'well-crafted', 'vignettes', 'nothing', 'more.His', 'ailing', 'father', 'respected', 'prize-winning', 'writer', 'played', 'effectively', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'not', 'look', 'ill', 'calm', 'attitudes', 'even', ""n't"", 'look', 'suffering', 'anything', 'much', 'calmer', 'son', 'David', 'whom', ""n't"", 'enter', 'grown-up', 'life', 'fact', 'David', 'life', 'full', 'easy', 'family', 'life', 'kind', 'accepts', 'easy', 'Sponge', 'Bob', 'balloon', 'floating', 'air', 'one', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'anything', 'substantial', 'meaningful', 'portrait', 'David', 'Bob.The', 'film', 'reminded', 'American', 'Beauty', 'slightly', 'overrated', 'film', 'middle-aged', 'person', 'life', 'America', 'much', 'darker', 'one', 'Frankly', 'hated', 'film', 'least', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'character', 'made', 'point', 'showing', 'utter', 'bleakness', 'what', 'do', 'Weather', 'Man', 'bit', 'lighter', 'tone', 'like', 'part', 'still', 'could', 'not', 'see', 'point', 'film', 'life', 'unbearable', 'lightness', 'ridiculousness', 'existence.Or', 'film', 'say', 'can', 'not', 'predict', 'life', 'made', 'point', 'most', 'viewers', 'watching', 'film', 'however', 'news', 'need', 'more', 'original', 'ways', 'presenting', 'old', 'news', 'more', 'insightful', 'episodes', 'ones', 'archery', 'child', 'abuse', 'estranged', 'wife', 'daughter', 'morose', 'weather', 'man.Some', 'other', 'director', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'not', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'who', 'not', 'have', 'own', 'voice', 'such', 'films', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Ring', 'Mexican', 'Mousehunt', 'was', 'still', 'OK', 'fine', 'stars', 'did', 'job', 'film', 'where', 'filmmaker', 'views', 'life', 'are', 'presented', 'examined', 'nothing', 'desperate', 'will', 'make', 'film', 'quirky', 'unconventional', 'Sad', 'thing', 'also', 'good']",N/A
962781,AGLL9FGGXRSH7,B000CSUNQQ,"T. Williams ""world traveller""","[0, 1]","How does one begin to describe this movie? The very elements that are the most distracting and disturbing are ultimately the things that make it interesting. Plus, it never hurts to have Michael Caine in the movie.Not necessarily a fan of Nicholas Cage's work, I could not help but give him grudging admiration for his work in this film. For all his past excesses and over-the-top histrionics, Cage has gradually toned it down in the last decade and has discovered that ""less is more.""This has never been more true than in his portrayal of weather man David Spritz. Cage somehow ""sad sacks"" his way into the heart of the viewer, despite the fact that his character is unburdened by many redeemable qualities. (Let's face it, no one expects a weather man to be Albert Schweitzer.) While it is difficult to empathize with the whining of a guy who receives a huge salary - and a few other perks - for no other discernable skills other than being able to read a teleprompter, Cage somehow manages to play this guy as an ""everyman.""(I never believed Cage as a TV personality - he didn't have the hair for the local weather gig - though given the bald pates of both Al Roker and Willard Scott, I guess the ""anchor hair"" is not necessarily a requirement for a network job.)It is however Michael Caine who comes packing ""gravitas"" in this movie He imbues this film with a depth that would otherwise be lacking. Playing against type, his portrayal of a reserved, emotionally unavailable father is a masterwork. I was riveted every time his character came on the screen. Although one could see how his emotionally utilitarian demeanor might have affected his son, he somehow remains sympathetic, which I credit to Caine's skills as an actor. Casting Caine in this film was a coup for the director, as he brings the good will of the audience to any role he tackles.Hope Davis has never been more attractive, even while her character plays a little shrill. Gemmene De La Pena offers a respite from the cookie cutter moppets that usually pop up in Hollywood movies. (Hopefully the storyline of her subplot doesn't dog her the rest of her life.) Nicholas Hoult gives an adult performance in another role that breaks the mold for acceptable storylines for kids in movies. Gil Bellows is appropriately slimy from the get go, signaling ahead where that story strand is headed.Although the humor is crass and sophomoric, by the end of the film I found myself moved by the foibles of the all-too-human characters. The script is all over the place with several little stories competing for our attention, but perhaps that is the way life is. (Don't ask me about the bow and arrow bit - I am still not sure about that.) Screenwriter Steve Conrad has lavished so much love into the layering of the story and the crafting of the film's characters that I was sure that it had to be an adaptation of a favorite novel.""The Weather Man"" is a movie that kept me interested despite its many shortcomings. It will never be considered a great movie, but is one well-worth renting on a rainy afternoon.",3,3.5 Stars on the strength of Michael Caine's performance,1144627200,"04 10, 2006",2006,3070,"['How', 'one', 'begin', 'describe', 'movie', 'very', 'are', 'most', 'distracting', 'disturbing', 'are', 'ultimately', 'things', 'make', 'interesting', 'never', 'have', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'movie.Not', 'necessarily', 'fan', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'work', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'give', 'grudging', 'admiration', 'work', 'film', 'past', 'excesses', 'over-the-top', 'histrionics', 'Cage', 'gradually', 'toned', 'down', 'last', 'decade', 'discovered', 'less', 'more', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'true', 'portrayal', 'weather', 'man', 'David', 'Spritz', 'Cage', 'somehow', 'sad', 'sacks', 'way', 'heart', 'viewer', 'fact', 'character', 'unburdened', 'many', 'redeemable', 'qualities', 'Let', 'face', 'one', 'weather', 'man', 'be', 'Albert', 'Schweitzer', 'difficult', 'empathize', 'whining', 'guy', 'who', 'huge', 'salary', 'few', 'other', 'perks', 'other', 'discernable', 'skills', 'other', 'being', 'able', 'read', 'teleprompter', 'Cage', 'somehow', 'play', 'guy', 'everyman', 'never', 'believed', 'Cage', 'TV', 'personality', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'hair', 'local', 'weather', 'gig', 'given', 'bald', 'pates', 'Al', 'Roker', 'Willard', 'Scott', 'guess', 'anchor', 'hair', 'not', 'necessarily', 'requirement', 'network', 'job', 'however', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'who', 'packing', 'gravitas', 'movie', 'film', 'depth', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'lacking', 'Playing', 'type', 'portrayal', 'reserved', 'emotionally', 'unavailable', 'father', 'masterwork', 'was', 'riveted', 'time', 'character', 'came', 'screen', 'one', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'emotionally', 'utilitarian', 'demeanor', 'might', 'have', 'affected', 'son', 'somehow', 'sympathetic', 'credit', 'Caine', 'skills', 'actor', 'Casting', 'Caine', 'film', 'was', 'coup', 'director', 'good', 'will', 'audience', 'role', 'Davis', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'attractive', 'even', 'character', 'little', 'shrill', 'Gemmene', 'De', 'La', 'Pena', 'respite', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'moppets', 'usually', 'pop', 'up', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'Hopefully', 'storyline', 'subplot', ""n't"", 'dog', 'rest', 'life', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'adult', 'performance', 'role', 'mold', 'acceptable', 'storylines', 'kids', 'movies', 'Gil', 'Bellows', 'appropriately', 'slimy', 'get', 'go', 'signaling', 'ahead', 'where', 'story', 'strand', 'humor', 'crass', 'sophomoric', 'end', 'film', 'found', 'moved', 'foibles', 'all-too-human', 'characters', 'script', 'place', 'several', 'little', 'stories', 'competing', 'attention', 'perhaps', 'way', 'life', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'bow', 'arrow', 'bit', 'am', 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'Screenwriter', 'Steve', 'Conrad', 'lavished', 'so', 'much', 'love', 'layering', 'story', 'crafting', 'film', 'characters', 'was', 'sure', 'had', 'be', 'adaptation', 'favorite', 'novel', 'Weather', 'Man', 'movie', 'kept', 'interested', 'many', 'shortcomings', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'considered', 'great', 'movie', 'one', 'well-worth', 'renting', 'rainy', 'afternoon']",N/A

I felt that Dave Spritz (Nicolas Cage) is kind of a loser. Basically a good man who wants to do the right thing. But he compares himself with his larger-than-life father. An award winning writer. Cage's character is an average man. Someone who if he didn't grow up in a upper-middle class home more than likely wouldn't have even become The Weather Man. He's not even a meteorologist. He's more of an personality.  It seems the local weatherman is about being likable and good with kids judging from what I see on the news.At first, I didn't like Nicolas character. He's making $240,000 a year just working a few hours a day! Then you realize he has to put up with a lot of crap. People wanting his autograph (I think he's puzzled by that). Having food thrown at him (junk food like Big Gulps and McDonald's hot apple pie). Having to make appearances at odd events and appear to be happy no matter how he feels.Yet he wants to be a good father. His daughter is made fun of at school and called a cruel nickname because of her weight and clothes she wears. Dave could have handled the matter better.What concerns me a little is about the young lady who played this part.

962784,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B000CSUNQQ,Wheelchair Assassin,"[4, 10]","Having watched The Weather Man twice this past week, I can see why so many people have criticized this movie in such a vitriolic fashion: there's little plot to speak of, and the protagonist is rarely likeable, and the tone is frequently dreary and depressing even during the comedic moments.  But, in the end, this movie really isn't about being light or pleasant, or even about plot development; if you want an unchallenging comedy with a clearly delineated plot, watch Wedding Crashers.  What the Weather Man is is a contemplative, stylishly-shot deadpan comedy that portrays upper-middle class alienation at its most quietly stultifying.  Even as I laughed at it, I found a certain undercurrent of desperation and depression in this movie, sort of like a darker, more angst-ridden version of Office Space.  Nicolas Cage is, well, Nicolas Cage, playing the sort of role he was born to play as Dave Spritz, a Chicago weather man (not to be confused with a meteorologist) whose job has made him rich but who seemingly can't overcome his various hangups and neuroses.Conveying the same sort of moral weakness and social anxiety he made so memorable in Adaptation and Lord of War, Cage manages to make Dave somewhat sympathetic in spite of the glaring flaws in his character.  Dave's actually got a lot going on in his mind, but it doesn't translate into an ability to express himself clearly or relate to other people in any sort of meaningful way.  His efforts to connect with his overweight daughter are noble but frequently misguided; he botches a shot at a reconciliation with his ex-wife when he violates her trust; and he can't even insult his ex's white-collar shlub of a boyfriend without sounding like an idiot in the process.  Basically, he's a phony, and he knows it, and knows other people know it: he gets paid a six-figure salary for an easy job that contributes little to society, but at the same time he's had to trade in his self-respect.  He's in the uncomfortable situation of being a public figure who can't relate to the public, as we see in his highly unpleasant interactions with viewers, and (in a hilarious running joke) the vacuity of his job has made him a citywide target for fast food-tossing passersby.  Throughout the movie, little indignities pile up, only adding to Dave's increasing frustration with his emotionally stunted existence.As the movie opens, Dave's relationships with his whole family--his self-rightheous ex-wife, his overweight daughter, his mildly troubled son, and his prize-winning novelist of a father-are strained to varying degrees, while Dave tries to get a national-level job that he thinks will solve all his family problems but which probably won't.  Some of the scenes involving Dave's family life feel rushed and half-developed, but his complicated bond with his dying father, Robert King Spritzel (Michael Caine) is more than strong enough to carry the movie,  as the script manages to wring a lot of offbeat humor and a few affecting moments from the interactions of a father and son who don't seem to have anything in common apart from genes.  Caine has been underused in some mediocre and downright weak movies these past few years--The Cider House Rules, Miss Congeniality, and the dreadful Batman Begins come to mind--but here his cool demeanor makes him the perfect straight man for the movie's unlikely comic duo.  Dave's father is everything Dave hoped to be but isn't--self-assured, dignified, respected--and he inhabits a completely different moral and intellectual plane that Dave clearly aspires to but will probably never reach.  Robert doesn't regard Dave with anger or contempt so much as befuddlement, as though he doesn't quite understand how his son ended up turning into this guy.While the movie may be somewhat aimless and meandering, its fairly short running time, dry sense of humor, and Gore Verbinski's directorial flair are more than enough to keep it from ever getting truly boring.  Verbinski has an interesting visual style, embellishing the cinematography with lots of nice, expansive shots of Chicago in winter.  The movie also occasionally cuts away from the narrative for snapshots ranging from a random guy expressing his hatred for Dave as he watches the weather forecast, to Dave enjoying some meaningless sex with a beer girl, to a hilariously vivid illustration of where Dave's daughter's nickname (which I probably can't repeat here) comes from.  These little asides certainly don't add much to the plot, but it's these little things that let us know what kind of world Dave lives in and really add to the whole atmosphere of cynicism that pervades the movie.We do see Dave gaining some measure of redemption and contentment at the end, although there's no telling how long that will last.  Still, watching the evolution of his character over the course of the movie as he confronts himself and the life he's lived helps The Weather Man become more than just another deadpan comedy.  I'm not going to say this is the best movie ever, or even of last year, because it definitely isn't.  It is, however, an intriguing departure from the increasingly mediocre norm for Hollywood movies.  Definitely worth a watch or two.",4,Better than you might think,1149897600,"06 10, 2006",2006,5216,"['Having', 'watched', 'Weather', 'Man', 'twice', 'past', 'week', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'so', 'many',

Even beyond the insistence that we care about a shallow guy who is just unlikable in every way, the movie's need for sophomorish, locker room language and references is ridiculous.  From explaining 'camel toe' to a the constant f-bombs, and Cage's sexual fantasies, I get a since I am at a 10th grade slumber party, not watching what is supposed to be some deep movie.Cage can act but he couldn't save it.
