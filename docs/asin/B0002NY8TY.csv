It's  not unlike car drivers slowing down on a road orhighway,  hoping to get a better look at cars involved in anaccident for example, meaning there's an undeniable fascinationin the unusual.Here, Jerry Lewis (who was 31 at the time) plays Sidney - ahandyman and superintendent of a large 12 floor apartmentbuilding. Lewis's character is struggles in handling customersatisfaction of the tenants, namely, in completing all sorts ofrepairs, electrical, plumbing, etc.The comical aspect, obviously, is not lost, in the juxtapositionof the ultra-responsible, hard-working, model and upstandingcitizens in all walks of life with Lewis's character -  who is aparadox of a human being, with a still-developing perception ofreality, and less-than apprentice-level skills in  completing theoddjobs, in interacting socially. etc.For example, there's an intentional awkwardness in interactingwith gangs, taking lightly  tenant complaints, ineffectiveness inbody-to-body combats, or in public relations with the public as apolice officer, etc.Darren McGavin, as ""Mike"" plays a mixture of regular citizen,(yet company man in the police corps), and model citizen eager tolend a hand to a fellow human being struggling with variouschallenges and adaptations. He's mystified of Lewis's clumsiness- obviously contrived by the talented actor to reap the mostlaughs and sympathy possible.Next, Martha Hyer, using her own name, has a remarkable presenceas a clean-cut woman with a strong character and keenintelligence, intent in being successful in her social workerrole and mission. In this particular case, she's charged  ofrescuing juvenile delinquents from a destiny of futile behaviorand misery -  that person being, of course, Lewis.At the same time, the reason for Hyer's character is to perhapspull a few jabs and get some laughs from the too-good-to-be-trueimage presented, as well as overdone spotless vanity, andsuperficiality of some women, too often, in the 20th century, aswell as the ""social work"" or ""charity volunteerism"" used as alitmus test in some classes, in evaluating one's worthiness, thathas to be demonstrably proven.The work isn't dated too much, even in 2009, but is actuallyamplified by the excess quantity and generic quality of too manymovies these days.Society's hierarchical nature is acknowledged, which has beenmitigated since the end of military conscription and thedisappearance of rigid social customs in the mass media andbetween various professions.Jerry Lewis's acting clearly shows a natural affinity to film andcomedy, proving that self-deprecating humor is commerciallysuccessful in entertainment.",3,Self-deprecating humor is commercially successful in entertainment,1260230400,"12 8, 2009",2009,2758,"['Delicate', 'Delinquent', '1957', 'will', 'particularly', 'interest', 'theyouth', 'segment', 'general', 'audience', 'enjoying', 'comedy', 'uniquestyle', 'not', 'car', 'drivers', 'slowing', 'down', 'road', 'orhighway', 'hoping', 'get', 'better', 'look', 'cars', 'involved', 'anaccident', 'example', 'meaning', 'undeniable', 'fascinationin', 'unusual.Here', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'who', 'was', '31', 'time', 'Sidney', 'ahandyman', 'superintendent', 'large', '12', 'floor', 'apartmentbuilding', 'Lewis', 'character', 'struggles', 'handling', 'customersatisfaction', 'tenants', 'namely', 'completing', 'sorts', 'ofrepairs', 'electrical', 'plumbing', 'etc.The', 'comical', 'aspect', 'obviously', 'not', 'lost', 'juxtapositionof', 'ultra-responsible', 'hard-working', 'model', 'upstandingcitizens', 'walks', 'life', 'Lewis', 'character', 'who', 'aparadox', 'human', 'being', 'still-developing', 'perception', 'ofreality', 'less-than', 'apprentice-level', 'skills', 'completing', 'theoddjobs', 'interacting', 'socially', 'etc.For', 'example', 'intentional', 'awkwardness', 'interactingwith', 'gangs', 'taking', 'lightly', 'tenant', 'complaints', 'ineffectiveness', 'inbody-to-body', 'combats', 'public', 'relations', 'public', 'apolice', 'officer', 'etc.Darren', 'McGavin', 'Mike', 'mixture', 'regular', 'citizen', 'yet', 'company', 'man', 'police', 'corps', 'model', 'citizen', 'eager', 'tolend', 'hand', 'fellow', 'human', 'being', 'struggling', 'variouschallenges', 'adaptations', 'mystified', 'Lewis', 'clumsiness-', 'obviously', 'contrived', 'talented', 'actor', 'reap', 'mostlaughs', 'sympathy', 'possible.Next', 'Martha', 'Hyer', 'using', 'own', 'name', 'remarkable', 'presenceas', 'clean-cut', 'woman', 'strong', 'character', 'keenintelligence', 'intent', 'being', 'successful', 'social', 'workerrole', 'mission', 'particular', 'case', 'charged', 'ofrescuing', 'juvenile', 'delinquents', 'destiny', 'futile', 'behaviorand', 'misery', 'person', 'being', 'course', 'Lewis.At', 'same', 'time', 'reason', 'Hyer', 'character', 'perhapspull', 'few', 'jabs', 'get', 'laughs', 'too-good-to-be-trueimage', 'presented', 'as', 'well', 'overdone', 'spotless', 'vanity', 'andsuperficiality', 'women', 'too', 'often', '20th', 'century', 'aswell', 'social', 'work', 'charity', 'volunteerism', 'used', 'alitmus', 'test', 'classes', 'evaluating', 'one', 'worthiness', 'thathas', 'be', 'demonstrably', 'proven.The', 'work', ""n't"", 'dated', 'too', 'much', 'even', '2009', 'actuallyamplified', 'excess', 'quantity', 'generic', 'quality', 'too', 'manymovies', 'days.Society', 'hierarchical', 'nature', 'acknowledged', 'beenmitigated', 'end', 'military', 'conscription', 'thedisappearance', 'rigid', 'social', 'customs', 'mass', 'media', 'andbetween', 'various', 'professions.Jerry', 'Lewis', 'acting', 'clearly', 'natural', 'affinity', 'film', 'andcomedy', 'proving', 'self-deprecating', 'humor', 'commerciallysuccessful', 'entertainment']",N/A
842107,A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI,B0002NY8TY,"Randy E. Halford ""Comedy Fan""","[0, 0]","After his highly-publicized split from partner Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis wasted no time getting out his first solo effort, ""The Delicate Delinquent"". And it kicks off appropriately with what would become a surefire Lewis shtick---two gangs of punks are about to rumble in an alleyway, via ""West Side Story"". Suddenly the tension is disrupted by Jerry bursting from a door into the middle of the rumble & stumbling into garbage cans. From there, Lewis plays a well-meaning schnook-like janitor mistaken for a juvenile but still sorely needing guidance & structure in his life. Enter Darren McGavin (deftly playing the cop ""mentor"" role which Martin previously turned down) who begins steering Lewis on the straight & narrow through some amusing Police Academy training. The script seems more like a serious drama gagged up, Jerry Lewis-style. It even calls on Lewis to deliver some serious acting, which he handles very well. This would set the tone for many future Lewis comedies as a schnook faced with problems both comic & serious.Probably not Lewis' best comedy, but it certainly has its moments. And...surprise! A Lewis film that doesn't end with a broad gag but an earnest dramatic speech?
