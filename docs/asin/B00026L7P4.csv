825109,AVOCNUFOXUCA6,B00026L7P4,Brian A. Schar,"[0, 0]","If anyone wondered why the movie musical died in the early 80s until Disney resurrected it with ""Beauty and the Beast,"" just watch 1980's ""The Apple"", ""Xanadu"" and ""Can't Stop the Music,"" and you will understand.  ""The Apple"" is truly something special.  The debut film of Catherine Mary Stewart, the bad movie queen of the 80s and 90s, this is also one of the first Cannon pictures, and it almost sank Cannon before it even got off the ground.  The restored DVD is pristine, and shows that very little expense was spared in making this perplexing, baffling mess - hundreds of extras, elaborate sets, bizarre costumes, and other trappings that show this was no ordinary B-movie.  The songs are bad, the acting is horrible, the writing and direction are worse.  But, ""The Apple"" maintains a high level of energy, as well as such amazing levels of badness that the movie is more entertaining than many ""good"" movies.  And, I won't give a spoiler, but, hippies?  Really?  Like Cartman, I refuse to place my faith in hippies.If you love bad movies, you will enjoy ""The Apple"".  It's at least worth a rent to see how Catherine Mary Stewart got started, and why she eventually ended up in ""World Gone Wild"" (another can't-miss feature for bad movie fans).",5,An amazing bad movie,1262044800,"12 29, 2009",2009,1249,"['anyone', 'wondered', 'why', 'movie', 'musical', 'died', 'early', '80s', 'Disney', 'resurrected', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'just', 'watch', '1980', 'Apple', 'Xanadu', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Stop', 'Music', 'will', 'understand', 'Apple', 'truly', 'something', 'special', 'debut', 'film', 'Catherine', 'Mary', 'Stewart', 'bad', 'movie', 'queen', '80s', '90s', 'also', 'one', 'first', 'Cannon', 'pictures', 'almost', 'sank', 'Cannon', 'even', 'got', 'off', 'ground', 'restored', 'DVD', 'pristine', 'very', 'little', 'expense', 'was', 'spared', 'making', 'perplexing', 'baffling', 'mess', 'hundreds', 'extras', 'elaborate', 'sets', 'bizarre', 'costumes', 'other', 'trappings', 'show', 'was', 'ordinary', 'B-movie', 'songs', 'are', 'bad', 'acting', 'horrible', 'writing', 'direction', 'are', 'worse', 'Apple', 'high', 'level', 'energy', 'as', 'well', 'such', 'amazing', 'levels', 'badness', 'movie', 'more', 'entertaining', 'many', 'good', 'movies', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'spoiler', 'hippies', 'Really', 'Cartman', 'refuse', 'place', 'faith', 'hippies.If', 'love', 'bad', 'movies', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Apple', 'least', 'rent', 'see', 'how', 'Catherine', 'Mary', 'Stewart', 'got', 'started', 'why', 'eventually', 'ended', 'up', 'World', 'Gone', 'Wild', ""can't-miss"", 'feature', 'bad', 'movie', 'fans']",The Apple

This one was just the fact that we had pay TV, and it's 11:00 at night, so the parents want the cable disconnected from the bedroom(Boo-Hiss). This movie is set in 1998, and NYC is under the grips of a movement called ""The Apple"". The Apple has NYC in it's clutches, and everyday certain songs are played, and everyone is to participate in the dance. Well one day a singing couple named Adam and Eve start playing thier brand of music. Folk romantic type music that is pure, and of heart. Unfortunately for The Apple the music is catching on, so a plan is devised to turn them over to thier side. Adam and Eve are invited to a party in which the hope will be that they can be persuaded to play Apple music instead of thier mush. Eve becomes converted to the Apple, but Adam stands his ground. He leaves Eve with the Apple in the hopes that she'll come home. That's where I left off. It's kind of what would've happened had the real Adam not taken the fruit from the real Eve. That in Genesis Adam turned Eve over to God, and told God that she tried to make him sin instead of what really happened.

Well I can say without a doubt this is the strangest film I've seen in awhile and I've seen FORBIDDEN ZONE, XANADU and THE PIRATE MOVIE all within the last two weeks.Sometime in the future, 1994 to be exact, the world is controlled by an evil music agent, Mr. Boogalow, who somehow has Big Brother-like control over the police and society in general.  Everyday at a designated time everyone, and I mean everyone, must dance for 60 minutes to his BIM music.  Also all people must wear a reflective triangle sticker on their face.Folksy singers Bibi & Alphie don't belong in the BIM-tastic world so Boogalow buys off Bibi and turns her into a BIM superstar.  Alphie rejects Boogalow's offer and fights to free Bibi and get her to join a hippy cult with him.  She does and just when Boogalow and the evil police are taking them away God, I mean, Mr. Topps rides out of the clouds in his flying Rolls Royce and whisks them away to Heaven.The one thing I forgot to mention is about every 5 minutes there's a massive overcrowded musical number that makes you cry out ""What the Hell is going on!?  My brain hurts!""  Needless to say I quite enjoyed this movie.  It's gonna be a few years before I could sit through it again though.The DVD has a good picture and sound, but where are the extras?  A trailer? That's it?  What makes it even more insulting is the trailer had multiple scenes that weren't in the movie.Catherine Mary Stewart later played Alex Rogan's girlfriend in THE LAST STARFIGHTER.  And writer/director/producer Menaham Golan later went on to work on OVER THE TOP, THE DELTA FORCE, AMERICAN NINJA, MISSING IN ACTION, INVASION U.S.A. and tons of movies that molded my young mind.",4,"""...meet an actual, actual, actual vampire!

Wierdest story you want hear, and how I was able to find this signal.Anyway, THE APPLE .. true about it having some large problems in tackiness and some bad acting in a couple spots (which is forgivable except the line or two given was SO bad). Besides that I just loved 80% of the music; I was in love with Catherine Mary Stewart (a Canadian from Edmonton).  The cast was actually excellent and they were good. I was crazy about the storyline and message (hope) etc. and the supremacy of good.  But then again, maybe I'm a bit of a refuge from the 60s as the movie says (or a wanna be).HEY FELLOW WITH THE MP3 .. I looked and looked and looked for the soundtrack. Give me your email so we can connect.  Oh and widescreen, hurray; no more long scenes with a -talking lamp- with no people.There are a ton of talented young people in this.  One of the dancers was from General Hospital at the time (Anna from GH; I'm talking 1987, she also had a short lived series with the fellow from Soap).  Anyway you see these people all over the place. And the people who played Andy and Pandy ... if that was their voices, wow!Some REALLY, really good songs, and a couple really poorly done, I suspect poorly recorded mostly.  The company I believed turned into Cannon Pictures.You have to be in a certain mindset to catch onto this movie, but it has lots of amazing things.Anyway, it has been a movie that I have constantly comeback to thinking about, and you cannot say that about many movies.

Dudley,"[4, 5]","The best way I can describe this musical that came out originally in 1980 is Rocky Horror Picture Show meets Xanadu meets Logan's Run with a little dash of the bible thrown in for good measure.This is one of the craziest movies that I've ever seen. And as a fan of all things cinematically cheesy, that's saying quite a lot. Mere words can't really describe The Apple. Like Showgirls, it is a movie that every mortal on this earth should be forced to watch at least once.the movie is set in the far flung future of 1994(!) and finds an evil and scheming music executive Mr. Boogalow trying to take of the world with the power of crass and poorly written pop music. His business is called Boogalow International Music or B.I.M. for short.  Mr. Boogalow is supposed to be the devil.  He finds an aspiring folk singer/songwriter duo who represent Adam & Eve. They are offered an oppurtuniaty to sign a contract with B.I.M. though Bibi (the female) is for doing that but her male companion in the folk duo Alphi is against it. She signs and he doesn't.  Next thing she's working for B.I.M. while Alphi is floudering trying to get his folk/hippie music across to a nation that has been brainwashed by B.I.M.  I should also mention that Mr. Boogalow has a son named Dandi who sometimes likes to run around in a tack gold thong.That's about the best I can do with a plot synopsis.I swear that practically every man in this movie comes across as either gay or homoerotic to the extreme.  All of the women act like they were acting in smut films on the side.The outfits are gawdy.The musical numbers are very frequent. In fact, I would say that out of the movie's short 86 minute running time, that over half of it is taken up with musical numbers.

825117,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00026L7P4,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","One of the greatest aspects of the DVD format is that it has brought underground cult films to a mass audience. No longer do you have to wonder about the oddball titles you've only heard about or that you've always wanted to see. These films might have been screened in large cities, but soon disappeared only to be whispered about nostalgically or forgotten completely. In my collection, I have two such films--musicals with rabidly supportive fan bases. And while I admire elements of both films, viewed with modern eyes--they are largely notable for their historic curiosity factor only.""The First Nudie Musical,"" from 1975, is a slight and amusing romp about a filmmaker trying to save his studio by making a porno musical. A spoof of conventional ""let's put on a show!"" type movie musicals--the film's humor is sweeter than you might imagine from it's title. In fact, most of the supposed outrageousness is saved for the actual production numbers. With corny costumes, mildly titillating lyrics, and nice sight gags--these songs can be fun if inconsequential. Taken out of it's time period, however, there is nothing particularly shocking about this picture. There is plenty of non-sexual nudity, if you didn't guess that from the title. It is interesting to see Cindy Williams and Diana Canova before they went on to become sitcom stars. Everyone is game and the mood is light. You might chuckle a few times, but it's a low budget affair that's just isn't as funny as you would hope.""The Apple,"" from 1980, has different aspirations--but elicits some of the same emotions. This is a rock opera spoof set to a sci-fi beat. With campy costumes, bad power ballads, and a classic struggle between good and evil--this film assaults your senses. It bludgeons you with it's very nature. When a young innocent singer is seduced by fame and fortune and the devilish Mr. Boogalow--it's up to her folksinging partner to save her soul and all of humanity. Designed to be outrageous, it was likely a spectacle when it premiered. Time, however, has dulled some of its glitter--and again, you might be wishing the film were a bit funnier than it actually is.I think both of these musicals have intrinsic historical value. I love things that try to push the boundaries of mainstream film. For film lovers or curiosity seekers, I recommend you check out either or both films--if they sound interesting. My lower ratings are more for the casual viewer. As satire, spoof or camp--in their day--these films were noteworthy. To a modern audience, they might just seem bad. But if they were meant to be bad, does that make them good? That's a conundrum I leave at your feet.

825118,A2RHV42BTJSVON,B00026L7P4,"Liolania ""In2Jesus""","[1, 1]","Oddly enough, this was a recommendation for me on Netflix, okay, its not all that odd since I love campy movies, but I hadn't watched any campy films of late.  Either way, after reading the polarizing reviews on Netflix, I decided to come read the reviews here at Amazon.com and after reading many many reviews and hearing just how deliciously bad this film was, I had to watch it!!!The movie does not seem to be quite as over the top in some of the areas that people stated, based on the descriptions of the shoulder pads, I thought I was going to see mile high shoulder pads along the lines of what Lady Gaga has (recently) worn, though I get the feeling Gaga was inspired by this film (especially the musical number ""Coming"" which seems to have very much inspired the bed dancing sequences in the ""Alejandro"" video).  Even if this movie was a source of her inspiration, I doubt she would admit to it, due to it definitely being low on the cool factor, compared to her normal ""inspirations ie. Freddie Mercury, Andy Warhol, David Bowie, ect.The costumes that were the most over the top, oddly enough, was the men's under wear, once you see it, you'll know what I mean!  It is just so over the top, and horrifyingly gaudy! Since this was made at the end of the disco-era, the clothing is supposed to exemplify all that was bad about the music industry and the consumerism of the time, and most likely if grunge didn't come along in 1994, Ithe clothing who's to say the clothing wouldn't have been that gaudy by 1994 (look at all the god aweful spandex, sequins, metalics, leg warmers, and shoulder pads of the 80's).The acting while not all bad, is certainly extremely over the top, and the award for the most campy and over the top must go to Ray Shell's portrayal of the character ""Shake"" and, wow, this character really reminds me of Chris Tucker's portrayal of the character Ruby Rhod from The Fifth Element, and due to the similarities, it is doubtful this is a coincidence.  Other over the top performances such as Vladek Sheybal's (whom is a seasoned performer) performance is extremely hammy and fun to watch!  With all the over-the-top acting, one really has to wonder if it was the intention to make a bad movie, I am hedging my bets on yet that is the point, at the only people who play their roles without a wink are the leads Catherine Mary Stewart George Gilmour just were not clued in on the joke (or were to oblivious).The story is actually fairly intriguing and for what this is, a campy schlock fest, its actually done quite well.  The main thing that keeps this film from being a good movie or a much bigger cult hit is that it is probably too chessy and silly for its own good. It is a good-intentioned message film with tongue planted firmly in cheek, and this is probably what keeps it from being a huge cult classic like ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"", it is so bizarre and over the top yet contains a very in-your-face message about the evils of the recording industry.Since I am a devout Bible-believing Christian, and I study the Bible daily, it was easy to see the biblical allusions, and the the main ones are taken from First and Last Book of the Bible and in a way, combines the two central and most pivotal events of those books and combines them together (the fall of man and the rapture). There is also a very STRONG reference to the illuminati here.  For those of you who may not know, there is a certain sect of people (some Christian, some just conspiracy theorist) who believe the world is going being taken over via the entertainment industry, especially music, and are trying to subvert the masses in to becoming Satan Worshippers with their knowledge of even doing so (though for the non-Christian people who buy in to the Illuminati conspiracy, they aren't worried about that, just mind control).  The film portrays exactly this (the oppression of the masses via entertainment and subliminal messages) and the strong use of the triangle and triangles within a triangle only punctuates the central idea of mind control and the illuminati and its roots from the Catholic church (through the biblical allusion).  As conspiracy theorist say, basically, the triangle is the Illuminati's symbol, and apparently they are obsessed with geometric shapes.With those things in mind, it was interesting how they used a symbol synonymous with illuminati, for the mark of the beast, for those unfamiliar with biblical prophecy, Satan will come to earth incarnate and force everyone to have a visible mark on their hand or forehead (though in the film it can be any wear and it is never called the mark of the beast).  That was a very clever, if not subtle biblical reference, and with the ending being representative of the rapture, it becomes even more apparent that this is what the mark was meant to represent (also note that the hippie cult appears to have marks on them as well, though not the triangle). Here the hippie counterculture is representative of a life style that is the antithesis of what is the cultural norm and this is exactly what Christianity is (though its a lot more than that, the basic idea is, ""Be in the world, not of the world."").This might seem like a lot of over thought, but once you study the Bible for a while, you begin to notice these things in films a lot, I have studied theology for the last 10yrs (in Bible college as well as at home), and also researched people's belief's on the illuminati (I don't personally believe they exist except in people's minds) and when I come across a film that makes no attempts to veil its jabs at ""modern"" society via biblical allusions, and conspiracy theories, it is impossible to not dissect it.If you can enjoy the hammy and campy qualities of the movie, you will find its message to be very relevant even today, look at how much music is controlling people these days (how they think, what they wear, ect), and as ridiculous as the random and unlikely one hour a day work out seems, there is some truth to this, music is a means to control, and even though I do not believe in the illuminati, as a musician I know just how controlling those music executives can be.So, bottom line if you love over the top spectacles that are campy and ridiculous and movies that take are campy and over the top, but still try to be a serious film, then you will definitely enjoy ""The Apple"".  The dancing (worst choreography in some sequences I have ever seen!), acting, costumes, script, music/lyrics are all terrible (though I should note that by the end of the movie the music seemed to get better, I actually have some of the songs in my head! I am not completely sure if this is cause the music improved or just got used to it!!!God Bless ~AmyPS:  Just wanted to note, while there is no nudity, there are some scenes with men wearing thongs...

825121,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B00026L7P4,Robert I. Hedges,"[1, 2]","This film, released in 1980 and prognosticating all the way to 1994 is a Golan-Globus production, and is essentially a reworking of the Faust legend. (After viewing it I have to wonder if Menahem Golan made a horrible pact with the devil.) I have seen an enormous number of terrible movies in my life, but this is right at the top of the heap for unadulterated camp. I will note now that the four star rating is obviously due to the ""so bad it's good quality"" of the film rather than any intrinsic redeeming qualities the film actually has.The film opens at a wretched music contest where the awful band promoted by ""Mr. Boogalow"" (Vladek Sheybal) is neck in neck with a small-time duo from Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, the cloying Bibi and Alphie. Boogalow resorts to devious means to win, but feels threatened enough to attempt to sign them to contracts. Boogalow give them little time to read the contracts and since they don't have legal representation, Alphie refuses to sign, while Bibi signs her soul away. If all this symbolism wasn't clear enough, there is a musical field trip to the lake of fire proving Boogalow's real identity; as a further confirmation Bibi is presented with an apple (not golden or delicious) that she is pressured into biting.After the premise that music agents are analogous to the devil (not far from the truth in some instances) is firmly established, we learn that in the future cars feature completely ridiculous profiles, that triangles are the only shape sanctioned by B.I.M. (Boogalow's agency), and that B.I.M. and the government are essentially one organization. I was especially amused by the concept of the ""National Fitness Program"" (a government program sponsored by our favorite Faustian NGO, B.I.M.), though less amused by the dancing involved. On the other end of the spectrum, I was completely unamused by Vladek Sheybal's singing voice when he solos in ""The Master,"" perhaps the worst vocal performance since the day of Florence Foster Jenkins.Bibi gets a makeover and becomes wildly successful, while Alphie continues to write horrid folk songs and live in a dump. Eventually Alphie decides living in a cave under a bridge is better than his apartment, so he moves in with a commune of hippies with names like ""Lotus Blossom."" Bibi escapes the clutches of Boogalow and company and joins Alphie, only to have the entire commune arrested for harboring a fugitive. Yes, Bibi is wanted for breach of contract and Boogalow and his team of lawyers and police show up for a final confrontation of Lawyers versus Hippies. This posed a conundrum: which group is less appealing? No, I jest: the movie makes it clear that it is a battle of good and evil on a titanic scale. When our heroes have seemingly no options left, the film takes a spiritual turn and presents some theology decidedly not found in the Bible. The alleged deity, ""Mr. Topps,"" shows up in a golden Rolls-Royce in the sky, turns the hippies to angels, and utterly defeats Boogalow in a scene that must be seen to be believed. I am sure this must have had something to do with the fact that the film was way over budget due to the cost of the insane costumes and musical numbers; well, that and the production team had absolutely no idea how to wrap up this mess.The film is low on dialogue, but high on musical numbers. It's kind of like a steam roller: once you are relieved that a musical number is over (and you will be), another one starts. The costumes and makeup are delightfully kitsch (I especially like the silver lipstick and the triangular face stickers) and leave no doubt as to when this was made. This film is truly jaw-dropping. I am not especially fond of musicals, but love cheesy movies of all varieties. This is an especially runny, excrementally smelly Camembert, putting it near the top of the bad movie menu of fine cheeses.""The Apple"" is highly recommended for anyone who believes they have seen a film so bad that there is not one worse.Come on...take the dare...bite ""The Apple.""",4,"If You Crossed ""Can't Stop The Music"" And ""1984""...",1217721600,"08 3, 2008",2008,4011,"['film', 'released', '1980', 'prognosticating', 'way', '1994', 'Golan-Globus', 'production', 'essentially', 'reworking', 'Faust', 'legend', 'viewing', 'have', 'wonder', 'Menahem', 'Golan', 'made', 'horrible', 'pact', 'devil', 'have', 'seen', 'enormous', 'number', 'terrible', 'movies', 'life', 'right', 'top', 'heap', 'unadulterated', 'camp', 'will', 'note', 'now', 'four', 'star', 'rating', 'obviously', 'due', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'quality', 'film', 'rather', 'intrinsic', 'redeeming', 'film', 'actually', 'film', 'opens', 'wretched', 'music', 'contest', 'where', 'awful', 'band', 'promoted', 'Mr.', 'Boogalow', 'Vladek', 'Sheybal', 'neck', 'neck', 'small-time', 'duo', 'Moose', 'Jaw', 'Saskatchewan', 'cloying', 'Bibi', 'Alphie', 'Boogalow', 'devious', 'means', 'win', 'feels', 'threatened', 'enough', 'attempt', 'sign', 'contracts', 'Boogalow', 'give', 'little', 'time', 'read', 'contracts', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'legal', 'representation', 'Alphie', 'sign', 'Bibi', 'signs', 'soul', 'away', 'symbolism', 'was', ""n't"", 'clear', 'enough', 'musical', 'field', 'trip', 'lake', 'fire', 'proving', 'Boogalow', 'real', 'identity', 'further', 'confirmation', 'Bibi', 'presented', 'apple', 'not', 'golden', 'delicious', 'pressured', 'biting.After', 'premise', 'music', 'agents', 'are', 'analogous', 'devil', 'not', 'far', 'truth', 'instances', 'firmly', 'established', 'learn', 'future', 'cars', 'feature', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'profiles', 'triangles', 'are', 'only', 'shape', 'sanctioned', 'B.I.M', 'Boogalow', 'agency', 'B.I.M', 'government', 'are', 'essentially', 'one', 'organization', 'was', 'especially', 'amused', 'concept', 'National', 'Fitness', 'Program', 'government', 'program', 'sponsored', 'favorite', 'Faustian', 'NGO', 'B.I.M', 'though', 'less', 'amused', 'dancing', 'involved', 'other', 'end', 'spectrum', 'was', 'completely', 'unamused', 'Vladek', 'Sheybal', 'singing', 'voice', 'when', 'Master', 'perhaps', 'worst', 'vocal', 'performance', 'day', 'Florence', 'Foster', 'Jenkins.Bibi', 'makeover', 'wildly', 'successful', 'Alphie', 'write', 'horrid', 'folk', 'songs', 'live', 'dump', 'Eventually', 'Alphie', 'living', 'cave', 'bridge', 'better', 'apartment', 'commune', 'hippies', 'names', 'Lotus', 'Blossom', 'Bibi', 'clutches', 'Boogalow', 'company', 'Alphie', 'only', 'have', 'entire', 'commune', 'arrested', 'harboring', 'fugitive', 'Yes', 'Bibi', 'wanted', 'breach', 'contract', 'Boogalow', 'team', 'lawyers', 'police', 'show', 'up', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Lawyers', 'versus', 'Hippies', 'posed', 'conundrum', 'group', 'less', 'appealing', 'No', 'jest', 'movie', 'clear', 'battle', 'good', 'evil', 'titanic', 'scale', 'When', 'heroes', 'have', 'seemingly', 'options', 'left', 'film', 'spiritual', 'turn', 'theology', 'decidedly', 'not', 'found', 'Bible', 'alleged', 'deity', 'Mr.', 'Topps', 'up', 'golden', 'Rolls-Royce', 'sky', 'hippies', 'angels', 'utterly', 'defeats', 'Boogalow', 'scene', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'am', 'sure', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'fact', 'film', 'was', 'way', 'budget', 'due', 'cost', 'insane', 'costumes', 'musical', 'numbers', 'well', 'production', 'team', 'had', 'absolutely', 'idea', 'how', 'wrap', 'up', 'mess.The', 'film', 'low', 'dialogue', 'high', 'musical', 'numbers', 'kind', 'steam', 'roller', 'once', 'are', 'relieved', 'musical', 'number', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'starts', 'costumes', 'makeup', 'are', 'delightfully', 'kitsch', 'especially', 'silver', 'lipstick', 'triangular', 'face', 'stickers', 'leave', 'doubt', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'film', 'truly', 'jaw-dropping', 'am', 'not', 'especially', 'fond', 'musicals', 'love', 'cheesy', 'movies', 'varieties', 'especially', 'runny', 'excrementally', 'smelly', 'Camembert', 'putting', 'top', 'bad', 'movie', 'menu', 'fine', 'cheeses', 'Apple', 'highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'so', 'bad', 'not', 'one', 'worse.Come', 'take', 'dare', 'bite', 'Apple']",The Apple

God comes in a gold Cadillac.  Yes, its bad.I don't think this movie intended to be horrible, but it is, and there lies the beauty of this film.

825125,AT7W1EXT0PF2Y,B00026L7P4,The Patriarch,"[5, 5]","The lie that all apples are healthful and beneficial to the human body is ultimately exposed in this nightmare. No apple has done more to harm mankind since Adam and Eve.B! (I. M.!)B! (I. M.!)It is with these opening words...errr...letters, that we are introduced to to the B.I.M. An evil American music corporation. As we watch these glitter-covered fools in space-suits dancing and singing this musical monstrosity, the scene cuts to Mr. Boogalew, CEO of the corp. as well as  his flaming underling, Shake. We are also introduced to the concept that we are watching an 'American Idol' show where the audience votes for the winner, by a reading of their vital signs.When the songs over, (thank God!) we learn that this takes place in the future! 1994 to be specific. The next song happens to be performed by our heroes, Alphie and Bebe, singing the saccharine song, ""Love: the universal melody."" It will make you puke.""We belong to one another/we share each other's destiny./United by our love, we're all children of/the universal family./And we are everybody's brother/we share the birthright to be free./And deep within our heart/there beats the song of the ages/Love: the universal melody!""Do the BIM!"" some moronic make-up wearing teen shouts. I can't imagine the complete lack of intellect a person must possess in order to request the song you just heard performed by a completely different group that has already left the stage. The only thing that got me through this song was the thought of bending BeBe over the hood of my Jeep. As a matter of fact, this was all that got me through this whole movie, as you will find should you read on.Now we're at a BIM celebration party. They have apparently invited Alphie and Bebe because their song did very well. We're also introduced to Ashley, Mr. Boogalow's flaming head of marketing. He makes up this horrible idea that everyone has to wear a plastic triangle on their foreheads yclept a BIM mark. From this point forward, everyone, including the extras will be wearing one of these.Dandi, male part of BIM's leading music duo decides to make his moves on Bebe even though she's Alphie's girl. Yep, there's gonna be a song.""You're made for meeeeee!/Created for meeeeee!/And I am your kiiiiiiiiiing!/You're made for meeeeeeee!/It's fated to beeeee./And you'll be my queeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen!/ You're made for meeeeeeeeeee!""And that's about all there is to that song. It is at this point,however, appropriate to bring up the choreography that these people dance to. The choreographer was either a total genius, a Steve Reich of the dance-world, or an inebriated shut-in that wasn't so much showing them how to dance as he was having violent epileptic seizures.The costumes? It looks like every costume from every broadway musical ever created was vomited, violently, onto the cast members. It is not unusual to see one man running around in a Techno-colour dreamcoat, being chased by the Phantom of the Opera, being chased by the entire cast of Godspell. As a matter of fact, by the end of this movie, sights like this will pass by you unnoticed. You could get into your bed only to find your wife is there with a midget circus-clown dressed up as a pig in a pilgrim costume and you won't bat an eyelash. ""Night, Hon.""Had enough? Too bad, because here comes another song! That's right, this movie will NOT give you a chance to take a breather and rejoin the land of the living after each song. There will be very few gaps as you are assaulted with a Tyson-like series of one-two punches that will leave you begging to stay down on the mat.Like a puppet on a string/Like a monkey on a swing(?)/Man is clinging to the ropes of his fantasies and hopes/We are dangling.(Clown: MR. Boogalow!)There's not too much to say about this one. I will say that if you are not scarred for life after watching grown men dancing around with boas then I worry about you. Anyway, we now have 4 minutes of dialog nobody cares about before we have another SONG!You thought the last song was bad? Your naivete charms me. Alphie and Bebe are now in HeIl. It may worry you that the women in this scene are fully clothed while the men are wearing practically nothing. As a matter of fact you should be worried, because I sure as heIl am. This song gets off to a terrifying start as vampires and a hoard of ghastly ghouls darts around like they've just took a shot of jenkem. You'll know you have because that's what this movie is.Long story short, Bebe signs the contact and Alphie doesn't. Now, Alphie storms out leaving Bebe alone with the BIM. And you know what, you got another friggin song coming. Choke on it. At least they finally show their straight viewers some service and have Bebe scantily clad in workout clothes. About friggin time.Just because you made it through that song with wrists intact, don't think you can tell your family to un-hide the silverware, because after a few short lines of dialog you've got another song. Things are looking up though, she's clad in Power-ranger gear and does some boxer-cising dance moves.[...].I hope you're still reading this, having survived this little soul-tourniquet, and are ready for more. Because you're gonna get more. After Alphie gropes his jewish landlord(he really does this) He sings her a song. The lyrics aren't worth typing.I would hate for my review to contain spoilers concerning the end of this film so I will write no more. Who am I trying to kid, there just isn't anything left worth writing about. Should I tell you that in the end God comes to Earth in a flying Rolls Royce and saves Alphie and Bebe by taking them to Heaven in his sweet ride? Because that's what friggin happens, that's how this movie ends.

825126,A1O4TMKKT0XZTJ,B00026L7P4,"Tim Edstrom ""Tim""","[6, 15]","The Apple is a merciless depiction of neo-Eden, flawless in its presentation. Brilliant Israeli director Menahem Golan is the master of his craft. When Copernicus first asserted that the sun, not Earth, was the center of the universe, he attained immediate pariah-status. Yet time proved that he was correct and a brilliant visionary. Those who disparage this starkly beautiful film are those who disparaged Copernicus so many years ago, witness and myopic in their world view. Golan has created a world that is uncanny in its resonance to today's post-Clintonian United States, where corporations choose what music Americans will enjoy and where police officers ""break into dance,"" a subversive symbol of the racial injustice that is today's police force. Dancing nuns? Nostradamus would be proud that Golan could foresee, way back in 1980, the ""dance"" around the facts of child molestation within the Catholic church. This is truly a tour de force of film verite. In its own brilliant, pitiless way, The Apple evokes our own age in its quest for glitter and success. The Apple doesn't moralize over the fate of the beautiful Mr. Boogelow, who loved so unwisely, although his last song is a thoroughly chilling comment on his life and the world in which he lived (1980).Catherine Mary Stewart, starlet of The Apple, is a poet and with The Apple as her canvass, this film is as great a cycle of poems as has been written in this century by any poet. This film is so rich and varied that it is difficult to convey how much there is to it. Cleverly constructed, there are hints and cross-references to hidden (and obvious) meanings throughout. Truth and falsity, reality and illusion are constant throughout, side by side, often difficult to differentiate. The Apple is a highly literate, ingenious and intelligent theatrical entertainment, probably cinema's most accomplished screenplay. But while one must respect the screenwriter's wit and erudition, it strikes me as the work of a brilliant impersonator rather than a dramatist with his own authentic voice. The film smells more of the lamp than of the musk of human experience.",5,The Apple: A Desparaged Yet Brilliant Masterpiece.,1100563200,"11 16, 2004",2004,2130,"['Apple', 'merciless', 'depiction', 'neo-Eden', 'flawless', 'presentation', 'Brilliant', 'Israeli', 'director', 'Menahem', 'Golan', 'master', 'craft', 'When', 'Copernicus', 'first', 'asserted', 'sun', 'not', 'Earth', 'was', 'center', 'universe', 'attained', 'immediate', 'pariah-status', 'time', 'proved', 'was', 'correct', 'brilliant', 'visionary', 'who', 'disparage', 'starkly', 'beautiful', 'film', 'are', 'who', 'disparaged', 'Copernicus', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'witness', 'myopic', 'world', 'view', 'Golan', 'created', 'world', 'uncanny', 'resonance', 'today', 'post-Clintonian', 'United', 'States', 'where', 'corporations', 'choose', 'what', 'music', 'Americans', 'will', 'enjoy', 'where', 'police', 'officers', 'break', 'dance', 'subversive', 'symbol', 'racial', 'injustice', 'today', 'police', 'force', 'Dancing', 'nuns', 'Nostradamus', 'would', 'be', 'proud', 'Golan', 'could', 'foresee', 'way', 'back', '1980', 'dance', 'facts', 'child', 'molestation', 'Catholic', 'church', 'truly', 'tour', 'force', 'film', 'verite', 'own', 'brilliant', 'pitiless', 'way', 'Apple', 'own', 'age', 'quest', 'glitter', 'success', 'Apple', ""n't"", 'moralize', 'fate', 'beautiful', 'Mr.', 'Boogelow', 'who', 'loved', 'so', 'unwisely', 'last', 'song', 'thoroughly', 'chilling', 'comment', 'life', 'world', 'lived', '1980', '.Catherine', 'Mary', 'Stewart', 'starlet', 'Apple', 'poet', 'Apple', 'canvass', 'film', 'as', 'great', 'cycle', 'poems', 'been', 'written', 'century', 'poet', 'film', 'so', 'rich', 'varied', 'difficult', 'convey', 'how', 'much', 'Cleverly', 'constructed', 'are', 'hints', 'cross-references', 'hidden', 'obvious', 'meanings', 'Truth', 'falsity', 'reality', 'illusion', 'are', 'constant', 'side', 'side', 'often', 'difficult', 'differentiate', 'Apple', 'highly', 'literate', 'ingenious', 'intelligent', 'theatrical', 'entertainment', 'probably', 'cinema', 'most', 'accomplished', 'screenplay', 'one', 'must', 'respect', 'screenwriter', 'wit', 'erudition', 'work', 'brilliant', 'impersonator', 'rather', 'dramatist', 'own', 'authentic', 'voice', 'film', 'more', 'lamp', 'musk', 'human', 'experience']",The Apple
825127,A1YQGWM6I2E5H8,B00026L7P4,XNS,"[0, 0]","In the canon of so-bad-they're-amazing movies, ""The Apple"" ranks somewhere in the vicinity of ""Howard the Duck"" and ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians."" The story is somewhat an amalgam of ""Phantom of the Paradise"" (its Faustian elements and music-industry satire), ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" (ditto, and ""The Apple"" is much better), ""Xanadu"" (pop cheese circa 1980), ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" (the camp, the glam, and the tight shiny underwear), ""Hair"" (the hippies) and John Huston's ""The Bible"" (seems to be inspired by the Adam/Eve story as interpreted by Huston). It's 86 minutes long, which is about the proper duration for a movie like this. The costumes are so mind-bogglingly over-the-top, as both the elaborate and the underwear seem to have cost about the same. The performances and writing are horrendous, but kudos to Vladek Sheybal and Ray Shell for acknowledging they're in a movie that's supposed to be trashy. Miriam Margolyes also has a hilarious (if stereotypical) supporting role as a landlady. This is the kind of movie that begs to be watched and simultaneously mocked and celebrated. You must watch it in widescreen format, for the full effect of the money that was spent on it (no B-level schlock is this!) One quibble: the trailer features material not in the actual movie. ""The Apple"" has everything: the good, the bad... and the gaudy.",5,Too Awful To Miss!,1282867200,"08 27, 2010",2010,1381,"['canon', ""so-bad-they're-amazing"", 'movies', 'Apple', 'ranks', 'somewhere', 'vicinity', 'Howard', 'Duck', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Conquers', 'Martians', 'story', 'somewhat', 'amalgam', 'Phantom', 'Paradise', 'Faustian', 'elements', 'music-industry', 'satire', 'Sgt', 'Pepper', 'Lonely', 'Hearts', 'Club', 'Band', 'ditto', 'Apple', 'much', 'better', 'Xanadu', 'cheese', 'circa', '1980', 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'Picture', 'Show', 'camp', 'glam', 'tight', 'shiny', 'underwear', 'Hair', 'hippies', 'John', 'Huston', 'Bible', 'be', 'inspired', 'Adam/Eve', 'story', 'interpreted', 'Huston', '86', 'minutes', 'long', 'proper', 'duration', 'movie', 'costumes', 'are', 'so', 'mind-bogglingly', 'over-the-top', 'elaborate', 'underwear', 'seem', 'have', 'cost', 'same', 'performances', 'writing', 'are', 'horrendous', 'Vladek', 'Sheybal', 'Ray', 'Shell', 'acknowledging', ""'re"", 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'trashy', 'Miriam', 'Margolyes', 'also', 'hilarious', 'stereotypical', 'supporting', 'role', 'landlady', 'kind', 'movie', 'be', 'watched', 'simultaneously', 'mocked', 'celebrated', 'must', 'watch', 'widescreen', 'format', 'full', 'effect', 'money', 'was', 'spent', 'B-level', 'schlock', 'One', 'quibble', 'trailer', 'material', 'not', 'actual', 'movie', 'Apple', 'everything', 'good', 'bad', 'gaudy']",The Apple
