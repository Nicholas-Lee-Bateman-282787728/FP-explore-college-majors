191064,AH93HX89KVQG2,1574922688,"Amy Green ""Amy Green""","[3, 3]","I have seen 3 film adaptations of The Secret Garden and this one is the most enjoyable while still being faithful to the book. The 1975 version was faithful but so slow it was like watching a faucet drip and completely boring; I couldn't get past the first hour. The 1993 version was entertaining but took such liberal departures from the book that I felt it did not capture the message or spirit of the book.I do think the ""adult Mary"" scenes at the beginning and end of this one were completely unnecessary and detracted from the story (they aren't in the book), and if I watch it again I'll skip those scenes.By the way, if you're bothered by the ""cousins marrying"" thing, that's not at issue here for two reasons: 1) In this adaptation, Colin is not Mary's cousin; their fathers were best friends. 2) Even if they were cousins, it used to be normal, and often expected, for cousins to marry, and in many places it still is. The U.S. has the only bans on cousins marrying in the Western world. But even in the U.S. prior to the Civil War, it was legal, accepted and sometimes encouraged, to keep money or bloodlines in the family. (Remember Ashley and Melanie in Gone with the Wind? They were cousins.) When I read the novel, I assumed that Colin and Mary would end up marrying. Mary would almost definitely not have considered Dickon because he was from a lower class. (For a short overview of why Americans think cousins marrying is taboo and the rest of the world doesn't, go to straightdope and search for ""What's Wrong with Cousins Marrying."" It's pretty interesting.)",4,This is the best adaptation of the book!,1273536000,"05 11, 2010",2010,1576,"['have', 'seen', '3', 'film', 'adaptations', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'while', 'still', 'being', 'faithful', 'book', '1975', 'version', 'was', 'faithful', 'so', 'slow', 'was', 'watching', 'faucet', 'drip', 'completely', 'boring', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'first', 'hour', '1993', 'version', 'was', 'entertaining', 'took', 'such', 'liberal', 'departures', 'book', 'felt', 'did', 'not', 'capture', 'message', 'spirit', 'book.I', 'do', 'think', 'adult', 'Mary', 'scenes', 'beginning', 'end', 'one', 'were', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'detracted', 'story', 'are', ""n't"", 'book', 'watch', 'again', ""'ll"", 'skip', 'scenes.By', 'way', ""'re"", 'bothered', 'cousins', 'marrying', 'thing', 'not', 'issue', 'here', 'two', 'reasons', '1', 'adaptation', 'Colin', 'not', 'Mary', 'cousin', 'fathers', 'were', 'best', 'friends', '2', 'Even', 'were', 'cousins', 'used', 'be', 'normal', 'often', 'expected', 'cousins', 'marry', 'many', 'places', 'still', 'U.S.', 'only', 'bans', 'cousins', 'marrying', 'Western', 'world', 'even', 'U.S.', 'prior', 'Civil', 'War', 'was', 'legal', 'accepted', 'sometimes', 'encouraged', 'keep', 'money', 'bloodlines', 'family', 'Remember', 'Ashley', 'Melanie', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'were', 'cousins', 'When', 'read', 'novel', 'assumed', 'Colin', 'Mary', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'marrying', 'Mary', 'would', 'almost', 'definitely', 'not', 'have', 'considered', 'Dickon', 'was', 'lower', 'class', 'short', 'overview', 'why', 'Americans', 'think', 'cousins', 'marrying', 'taboo', 'rest', 'world', ""n't"", 'go', 'straightdope', 'search', 'What', 'Wrong', 'Cousins', 'Marrying', 'pretty', 'interesting']",N/A
191065,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,1574922688,Andrew Raker,"[6, 7]","Below I compare and contrast the three color adaptations.1. The 1975 adaptation BBCThis adaptation is very low budgeted, and it shows in the picture quality, which is painful even if you are used to BBC 4.3 aspect ratio films. This said, the film is quite good in every other way if loyalty in plot is important to you. For example, Mr. Archibald Craven is given a larger role in this adaptation than in the 1987 and 1993 adaptations. Furthermore, a considerably amount of the dialogue is taken directly from the novel. Therefore, this adaptation is much less 'sound bites' and allows for the development of Mary, Dickon, and Collin's characters.The acting is also considerably better than the 1987 and 1993 adaptations. Unfortunately, with child actors of probably 10 or 11 years of age who have memorize a large amount of script, errors will be evident.Yet, the 1975 adaptation is the best adaptation. It is neither too mystical (1993) nor too gothic (1987).2. The 1987 adaptation HallmarkAlthough I know many individuals despise this adaptation, I enjoyed it for a change. Yes, the acting is not perfect and the accents are horrible. Yes, the ending is pathetic and quite changed from the novel. Yes, Dickon (as an adult) dies in World War I. Yet, when one considers what the film was trying to achieve (i.e. change the theme from a children's story to a social critique of problems in society), it does an effective job. The film is a little too gothic (in the Victorian literature definition -i.e. 'ghosts' and long, dark corridors), yet I did not think the gothic harmed the story but rather created a sense of anticipation.Again, if you want a loyal adaptation, I would urge the the 1975 adaptation. However, if you are tired of watching the 1975 adaptation and want to see a change, in my opinion, this 1987 adaptation is a better choice than the 1993 adaptation.(However, I am not certain I would pay more than $15.00 for the 1987 adaptation. Therefore, I do not own it on DVD - just VHS taped off the television when it aired sometime in the 1990s.)3. The 1993 adaptation Time WarnerI really hated this adaptation - saw it once years ago and really have no desire to see it again, except maybe to improve my review at some later date. My first problem was that Mary's parents were killed in an earthquake rather than a plague. (I am not certain what this proved?). Secondly, the mystical music was annoying as were the inappropriate accents - although of the two, I could tolerate the poor accents much more than the poor music.Additionally, other scenes were also altered. For example, Mary finds the key to the garden in her deceased aunt's bedroom in the shut up wing of the Manor. In the 1975 adaptation (and I think the 1987 adaptation also), Mary finds the key buried with some help from a robin. However, the robin does show Mary where the door to the garden is located.Unfortunately, the other problem I have with this film is that it is centered almost exclusively on Mary's character. Where the 1975 adaptation provides other characters (ex: Martha, Dr. Craven, Sir Archibald Craven, and Martha's mother have with numerous scenes in which Mary does not appear.) In the Warner adaptation, Mary is the focus of nearly every scene.Also, Collin's character was considerably altered into less dictatorial that in the novel the other film adaptations. In fact, at times, Collin appears very childish and timid - terrified of dying and of Mrs. Medlock (rather than bossing Mrs. Medlock, his nurse, and everyone else around).Of course, I could add other details. I will not because I do not remember everything about the 1993 adaptation. Sufficient to say, I do not recommend it.",4,Not bad for a change....,1259280000,"11 27, 2009",2009,3691,"['compare', 'contrast', 'three', 'color', 'adaptations.1', '1975', 'adaptation', 'BBCThis', 'adaptation', 'very', 'low', 'budgeted', 'picture', 'quality', 'painful', 'even', 'are', 'used', 'BBC', '4.3', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'films', 'said', 'film', 'quite', 'good', 'other', 'way', 'loyalty', 'plot', 'important', 'example', 'Mr.', 'Archibald', 'Craven', 'given', 'larger', 'role', 'adaptation', '1987', '1993', 'adaptations', 'Furthermore', 'considerably', 'amount', 'dialogue', 'taken', 'directly', 'novel', 'Therefore', 'adaptation', 'much', 'less', ""'sound"", 'bites', 'allows', 'development', 'Mary', 'Dickon', 'Collin', 'characters.The', 'acting', 'also', 'considerably', 'better', '1987', '1993', 'adaptations', 'Unfortunately', 'child', 'actors', 'probably', '10', '11', 'years', 'age', 'who', 'have', 'memorize', 'large', 'amount', 'script', 'errors', 'will', 'be', 'evident.Yet', '1975', 'adaptation', 'best', 'adaptation', 'too', 'mystical', '1993', 'too', 'gothic', '1987', '.2', '1987', 'adaptation', 'HallmarkAlthough', 'know', 'many', 'individuals', 'despise', 'adaptation', 'enjoyed', 'change', 'Yes', 'acting', 'not', 'perfect', 'accents', 'are', 'horrible', 'Yes', 'ending', 'pathetic', 'quite', 'changed', 'novel', 'Yes', 'Dickon', 'adult', 'World', 'War', 'when', 'one', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'trying', 'achieve', 'i.e', 'change', 'theme', 'children', 'story', 'social', 'critique', 'problems', 'society', 'effective', 'job', 'film', 'little', 'too', 'gothic', 'Victorian', 'literature', 'definition', '-i.e', ""'ghosts"", 'long', 'dark', 'corridors', 'yet', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'gothic', 'harmed', 'story', 'rather', 'created', 'sense', 'anticipation.Again', 'want', 'loyal', 'adaptation', 'would', 'urge', '1975', 'adaptation', 'However', 'are', 'tired', 'watching', '1975', 'adaptation', 'want', 'see', 'change', 'opinion', '1987', 'adaptation', 'better', 'choice', '1993', 'adaptation', 'However', 'am', 'not', 'certain', 'would', 'pay', 'more', '15.00', '1987', 'adaptation', 'Therefore', 'do', 'not', 'own', 'DVD', 'just', 'VHS', 'taped', 'off', 'television', 'when', 'aired', 'sometime', '1990s.', '3', '1993', 'adaptation', 'Time', 'WarnerI', 'really', 'hated', 'adaptation', 'saw', 'once', 'years', 'ago', 'really', 'have', 'desire', 'see', 'again', 'maybe', 'improve', 'review', 'later', 'date', 'first', 'problem', 'was', 'Mary', 'parents', 'were', 'killed', 'earthquake', 'rather', 'plague', 'am', 'not', 'certain', 'what', 'proved', 'Secondly', 'mystical', 'music', 'was', 'annoying', 'were', 'inappropriate', 'accents', 'two', 'could', 'tolerate', 'poor', 'accents', 'much', 'more', 'poor', 'music.Additionally', 'other', 'scenes', 'were', 'also', 'altered', 'example', 'Mary', 'key', 'garden', 'deceased', 'aunt', 'bedroom', 'shut', 'up', 'wing', 'Manor', '1975', 'adaptation', 'think', '1987', 'adaptation', 'also', 'Mary', 'key', 'buried', 'help', 'robin', 'However', 'robin', 'show', 'Mary', 'where', 'door', 'garden', 'located.Unfortunately', 'other', 'problem', 'have', 'film', 'centered', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'Mary', 'character', 'Where', '1975', 'adaptation', 'other', 'characters', 'ex', 'Martha', 'Dr.', 'Craven', 'Sir', 'Archibald', 'Craven', 'Martha', 'mother', 'have', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'Mary', 'not', 'appear', 'Warner', 'adaptation', 'Mary', 'focus', 'nearly', 'scene.Also', 'Collin', 'character', 'was', 'considerably', 'altered', 'less', 'dictatorial', 'novel', 'other', 'film', 'adaptations', 'fact', 'times', 'Collin', 'very', 'childish', 'timid', 'terrified', 'dying', 'Mrs.', 'Medlock', 'rather', 'bossing', 'Mrs.', 'Medlock', 'nurse', 'everyone', 'else', '.Of', 'course', 'could', 'add', 'other', 'details', 'will', 'not', 'do', 'not', 'remember', 'everything', '1993', 'adaptation', 'Sufficient', 'say', 'do', 'not', 'recommend']",N/A

While the girl that they hired to play the grown up Mary doesn't look much like the child, look for Colin Firth in a small but wonderful role as the grown up Colin.

191076,A97Q71MM5N4NW,1574922688,"Everett ""Future Raptured""","[9, 11]","I have to say that besides the acting on the kids part in this version of the secret garden, everything was great. The children could've done better in expression, but they were still good. The scenes were beautiful, and vibrant, just as they should have been. The music, Nocturne by Chopin, was beautiful, just wonderful for the movie. It gave it that dramatic feeling.Mary Lennox (Gennie James) is a spoiled brat who lives in India with her neglectful parents. When they die in a sudden plague, Mary is sent to live with a distant family friend by the name of Mr. Archibald Craven (Derek Jacobi) in a huge mansion he owns called Misselthwait Manor. It's mysterious enough place considering that there's a garden that's been locked up ever since Mr. Cravens wife died, but Mary keeps hearing someone crying at all hours at night in despair. Mary, soon after coming to the Manor, finds the key to the garden and see's that it is in need of desperate help of coming back to life. It also turns out the voice in peril is Colin (Jadrien Steele), the bedridden son of Mr. Craven. With a little help from Mary, and a boy named Dickon (Barret Oliver), they can bring the life back to the garden and the spirit within Colin all by themselves.The acting on the adults part was excellent. Especially Mrs. Medlock, who was played by Billie Whitelaw. In most other versions, they overdo Mrs. Medlocks mean side, but in this version, it shows she has a good side too. Dickon wasn't nearly as good a character in this version as he should've been. They turned him into a wise old man instead of a likeable animal charmer, not even following the book. Be that as it may, this movie is still probably the most acurate one following the book and my favorite version. I have to say it is probably the most dramatic out of all of the versions.

Unlike other versions, this movie includes an epilogue that reveals what happened to them - always a dangerous decision when one doesn't have the last words from the author herself, but here disasterous.Years later, we meet up with an engaged-to-be-married Mary and Colin.  To deal with the somewhat reasonable notion that this might be a bit unlikely with Dickon around, our Yorkshire Angel has been killed off in World War Two.  Anyone who knows the story and what Dickon represents understands how outrageous this is.

I also didn't like what they did with the Dickon character in this &quot;future&quot; scene.  I think most of us always imagined that Dickon &amp; Mary would get together eventually based on the words that Burnett wrote.  Dickon &amp; Mary were kindred spirits, but Colin &amp; Mary were like siblings in the real story.

191085,A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT,1574922688,"Linda R. Hendrex ""Rubicon""","[0, 0]","This is a sweet movie adaptation to my favorite children's book.  Overall, I enjoyed it but there were a few things that distracted.  The main problem with this movie is that it unnecessarily downplays some of the book's more dramatic moments - especially the climactic scene where Colin and his father meet in the garden.  I won't spoil it by telling all, but I will say that this scene in the book was highly dramatic and satisfying, while the movie makes it boring.  If you have read the book, you will know what I mean when you watch the movie.The little girl who plays Mary is far too nice to pull off the nasty little brat that Mary was when she first came to live with Lord Craven, however as the story progresses and Mary grows into a healthy child and learns to love, her performance is really very fetching.  Her American accent was an especially problematic part of the film but after awhile, I got used to it and so didn't mind so much.  I did like that some of the creepier aspects of the story are toned down so that the overall feel of this production is wholesome, with a touch of mystery.I would have rated this movie 2 stars for being not-so-great, except for the few plusses I noted above and the brief appearance of a very young Colin Firth in the role of the adult Colin Craven.  I usually don't like movie makers to take liberties with a beloved novel, but seeing Mary and Colin as adults gave some closure that the book lacked.  Because of the artistic way the screenwriters ended this movie in a way that felt satisfying while still respecting the intent of the original story, I feel it rates 3 stars - maybe 3.5 stars.  Other than this final small deviation, this film was mostly true to the general story and didn't throw in plot deviations that often would have ruined it for me.I have only seen two other versions of The Secret Garden - the 1993 version starring Kate Maberly and Heydon Prowse and the 1978 BBC production.  The 1993 version was actually really wonderful in many ways - more sumptuous and even better acted than this movie.  However, it took a lot of unnecessary liberties with the plot and sensationalized some of the spookier aspects of the story to an unnecessary extreme.  I didn't like that they villianized Mrs. Medlock and Dr. Craven in a way that wasn't supported by the original story.  So for those reasons, this Hallmark Hall of Fame version is the better one to watch if you like more faithfulness to the actual book.  And if you have children who are sensitive and given to nightmares, you might like this version a WHOLE LOT more than the 1993 movie.In my opinion, the only definitive version currently in existence is the 1978 BBC production.  If you can get past the dated technology and the low budget (even for it's time, it was low budget), then the script, the casting and the acting are the very best and most true to both the original book and the feel of the original story.  I would really LOVE to see the 1978 version re-done with modern technology and a budget the does justice to this classic story.This Hallmark movie was good for mild entertainment but only so-so.",3,Enjoyable Version of A Beloved Children's Classic Story,1403913600,"06 28, 2014",2014,3138,"['sweet', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'favorite', 'children', 'book', 'Overall', 'enjoyed', 'were', 'few', 'things', 'distracted', 'main', 'problem', 'movie', 'unnecessarily', 'book', 'more', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'especially', 'climactic', 'scene', 'where', 'Colin', 'father', 'meet', 'garden', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'telling', 'will', 'say', 'scene', 'book', 'was', 'highly', 'dramatic', 'satisfying', 'movie', 'boring', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'when', 'watch', 'movie.The', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'Mary', 'far', 'too', 'nice', 'pull', 'off', 'nasty', 'little', 'brat', 'Mary', 'was', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'live', 'Lord', 'Craven', 'however', 'story', 'progresses', 'Mary', 'healthy', 'child', 'love', 'performance', 'really', 'very', 'fetching', 'American', 'accent', 'was', 'especially', 'problematic', 'part', 'film', 'awhile', 'got', 'used', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'so', 'much', 'did', 'like', 'creepier', 'aspects', 'story', 'are', 'toned', 'down', 'so', 'overall', 'feel', 'production', 'wholesome', 'touch', 'mystery.I', 'would', 'have', 'rated', 'movie', '2', 'stars', 'being', 'not-so-great', 'few', 'plusses', 'noted', 'brief', 'appearance', 'very', 'young', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'role', 'adult', 'Colin', 'Craven', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'makers', 'take', 'liberties', 'beloved', 'novel', 'seeing', 'Mary', 'Colin', 'adults', 'gave', 'closure', 'book', 'lacked', 'artistic', 'way', 'screenwriters', 'ended', 'movie', 'way', 'felt', 'satisfying', 'still', 'respecting', 'intent', 'original', 'story', 'feel', 'rates', '3', 'stars', 'maybe', '3.5', 'stars', 'Other', 'final', 'small', 'deviation', 'film', 'was', 'mostly', 'true', 'general', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'throw', 'plot', 'deviations', 'often', 'would', 'have', 'ruined', 'me.I', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'two', 'other', 'versions', 'Secret', 'Garden', '1993', 'version', 'starring', 'Kate', 'Maberly', 'Heydon', 'Prowse', '1978', 'BBC', 'production', '1993', 'version', 'was', 'actually', 'really', 'wonderful', 'many', 'ways', 'more', 'sumptuous', 'even', 'better', 'acted', 'movie', 'However', 'took', 'lot', 'unnecessary', 'liberties', 'plot', 'sensationalized', 'spookier', 'aspects', 'story', 'unnecessary', 'extreme', 'did', ""n't"", 'villianized', 'Mrs.', 'Medlock', 'Dr.', 'Craven', 'way', 'was', ""n't"", 'supported', 'original', 'story', 'So', 'reasons', 'Hallmark', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'version', 'better', 'one', 'watch', 'like', 'more', 'faithfulness', 'actual', 'book', 'have', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'sensitive', 'given', 'nightmares', 'might', 'like', 'version', 'WHOLE', 'LOT', 'more', '1993', 'movie.In', 'opinion', 'only', 'definitive', 'version', 'currently', 'existence', '1978', 'BBC', 'production', 'can', 'get', 'dated', 'technology', 'low', 'budget', 'even', 'time', 'was', 'low', 'budget', 'then', 'script', 'casting', 'acting', 'are', 'very', 'best', 'most', 'true', 'original', 'book', 'feel', 'original', 'story', 'would', 'really', 'LOVE', 'see', '1978', 'version', 're-done', 'modern', 'technology', 'budget', 'justice', 'classic', 'story.This', 'Hallmark', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'mild', 'entertainment', 'only', 'so-so']",N/A

I have never read the book, and was not aware that they changed the plot just a bit, until I read the other reviewers comments.  I have never seen any of the other film versions and don't plan on it, since this one is perfect.The story is about a spoiled yet negelected girl named Mary who goes to live with her father's old aquaintance in England after her folks die in a flu epidemic in India.  She at first hates her new home because it is so huge and dark. Also it is filled with sounds of moaning, which at first she thinks is a ghost.  She finally begins to take an interest in life after meeting her sweet maid Martha.  Martha introduces her to her brother Dicken and they eventually find a secret garden. Dicken teaches her how to love people and God's creation, and she becomes likable.  She eventually meets Colin, the invalid boy who stays in his room who has also dealt with loneliness and neglect like Mary.  They become friends with Dicken who continues to teach them about hope.  For fans of Colin Firth, you will be thrilled to know he plays the grown up Colin at the end of the film.  He is young and HOT!I challenge those of you who have not seen this film to try to get through it with atleast shedding one tear.

Taken from her home to live with a guardian in England after her  parents death. &quot;Dickon&quot;, Mesterious boy who communes with nature.  &quot;Colin,&quot; son of Mary's guardian, is hidden from society.In  the movie Mray sets out to find and unlock the secrets to the mesterious  garden, making friends along the way.The scenery in this movie is  breath taking at times.

In theater and film you are bound by constraints. Are you going to make the film or wait for some future incarnation of the child lead who would appear to be the same as an adult? Nope.Gennie James came across as a spoiled and petulant child. Her performance made me look away at times and grind my teeth. Barret Oliver was magical. As a charming and sad child he gave the strong impression of being prescient. This sets things up for the inevitable longing and sorrow that follows.We dismiss the emotions of childhood because we believe that they cannot compare to our own vast warehouse of sadness and dreams lost. This film perhaps can correct this misperception.",4,A better release,1167696000,"01 2, 2007",2007,862,"['Having', 'read', 'slim', 'story', 'seeing', 'film', 'versions', 'am', 'inclined', 'think', 'best.It', 'not', 'least', 'important', 'how', 'childhood', 'characters', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'adult', 'characters', 'theater', 'film', 'are', 'bound', 'constraints', 'Are', 'going', 'make', 'film', 'wait', 'future', 'incarnation', 'child', 'lead', 'who', 'would', 'appear', 'be', 'same', 'adult', 'Nope.Gennie', 'James', 'came', 'spoiled', 'petulant', 'child', 'performance', 'made', 'look', 'away', 'times', 'grind', 'teeth', 'Barret', 'Oliver', 'was', 'magical', 'charming', 'sad', 'child', 'gave', 'strong', 'impression', 'being', 'prescient', 'things', 'up', 'inevitable', 'longing', 'sorrow', 'dismiss', 'emotions', 'childhood', 'believe', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'own', 'vast', 'warehouse', 'sadness', 'lost', 'film', 'perhaps', 'can', 'correct', 'misperception']",N/A
