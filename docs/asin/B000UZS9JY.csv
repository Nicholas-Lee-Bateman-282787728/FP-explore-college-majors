1098078,A3H7NPNDMGLOU4,B000UZS9JY,"Amazon Enthusiast ""The Lucky One""","[1, 1]","This is a wonderfully appealing DVD that is sure to be a hit with your canine companion.I ordered it for my 14 year old Pomeranian and I was shocked when he didn't show any interest in it whatsoever (my friend and I were both entranced by the animal sounds and squeaks and the interesting visuals of animals).  I just COULD NOT figure out why my dog wasn't interested; I'd pop in the DVD and he'd leave the room.  Go figure!My husband and I had recently noticed he wasn't very responsive to our commands, but put that off to his independent (i.e. bossy) Pomeranian nature.  After the DVD incident, we started noticing that he would mind us when he could see us, but if his back was turned, he'd do what he wanted.I took him to the vet & sure enough, he's gradually lost 100% of his hearing. He's stone cold deaf (age, says the vet). Thanks to this DVD, we know we've got a deaf dog, not a [totally] spoiled brat.  So now Norman goes for real walks instead of virtual ones.If your canine companion can still hear, I'm sure this will be a huge hit, just as other reviewers have mentioned.  The visuals are wonderfully engaging and the sounds will perk up their ears and their interest.  And if you happen to be wondering if your dog can still hear, this surely proved itself a great diagnostic tool for us!",5,Helped Me Realize My Dog Had Lost His Hearing,1243382400,"05 27, 2009",2009,1304,"['wonderfully', 'appealing', 'DVD', 'sure', 'be', 'hit', 'canine', 'companion.I', 'ordered', '14', 'year', 'old', 'Pomeranian', 'was', 'shocked', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'interest', 'friend', 'were', 'entranced', 'animal', 'sounds', 'squeaks', 'interesting', 'visuals', 'animals', 'just', 'COULD', 'NOT', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'dog', 'was', ""n't"", 'interested', ""'d"", 'pop', 'DVD', ""'d"", 'leave', 'room', 'Go', 'figure', 'husband', 'had', 'recently', 'noticed', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'responsive', 'commands', 'put', 'off', 'independent', 'i.e', 'bossy', 'Pomeranian', 'nature', 'DVD', 'incident', 'started', 'noticing', 'would', 'mind', 'when', 'could', 'see', 'back', 'was', 'turned', ""'d"", 'do', 'what', 'wanted.I', 'took', 'vet', 'sure', 'enough', 'gradually', 'lost', '100', '%', 'hearing', 'stone', 'cold', 'deaf', 'age', 'vet', 'Thanks', 'DVD', 'know', ""'ve"", 'got', 'deaf', 'dog', 'not', '[', 'totally', ']', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'So', 'now', 'Norman', 'real', 'walks', 'instead', 'virtual', 'canine', 'companion', 'can', 'still', 'hear', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'huge', 'hit', 'just', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'visuals', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'engaging', 'sounds', 'will', 'perk', 'up', 'ears', 'interest', 'happen', 'be', 'wondering', 'dog', 'can', 'still', 'hear', 'surely', 'proved', 'great', 'diagnostic', 'tool']",N/A

1098082,A1EF2SZYO9U2XB,B000UZS9JY,D.L.,"[54, 57]","I put this video in when my rather large pooch was being especially hyper and decided to sit and watch to see how he reacted.  At first he kind of freaked out, placing his nose directly up against the TV screen, wondering what and where those noises were coming from.  After a few minutes, he stepped away a little but eyes still fixed on the screen and ears straight up listening intently.  After another few minutes, he decided to lie down -- but still completely attentive - listening to the sounds and watching the imagery.  He didn't make it all the way through the video before he fell asleep, but I was amazed.  Not only have I never seen a dog watch television before, this video completely held his attention and calmed him down.  Heck, I enjoyed watching it with him myself.

1098083,A2V1J3JT5OOZFO,B000UZS9JY,Dragonwort Castle,"[1, 1]","Way too-long scenes with groundhogs (with added random birds chirping, and a poodle barking indoors that is not seen), ducks preening, flamingos eating, geese swimming (wierd and strange bird sounds, that sound like the African jungle type), 2 horses standing together swatting at flys with their tails for a long time, chickens scratching randomly for bugs, inside a barn goat scenes (goats peeing), and very random sounds that do not attract my dog, like, a dog barking in-doors but with outside bird chirping sounds, random cat growling noises, and the occasional dog in the video is not making any of the sounds or reacting to them, unnecessarily long scenes of a small dog chasing a ball but with strange sounds added, a scene of a fat cat with toys waved at it, long underwater scenes with wolves howling. Not that it needs to make sense to people, but my dog just ignored it all and seemed totally uninterested. There are random dog barking sounds that not only seem out of place to me but my dog does not respond (random sounds like a poodle yapping indoors, and is unseen). It is very much like someone set a camera up at a zoo in different places for some scenes, then added random sounds later. No deer at all. The piano is nice but not appropriate or made any difference to my dog. The 'loop' (auto replay) idea is the only good thing, but this DVD content could be annoying to dogs. It was annoying to us and I feel sorry for any animal stuck with this playing for hours. I do not think he could relate to any of these animals or the sounds. I do not recommend this video and suggest just leaving the radio or TV on and save money. Maybe if there were more dogs seen and kids playing, as my dog responds to those things.  Good idea but overall bad video. My dog likes to see other dogs on the TV and responds to their added noises (in commercials and movies) but this video did not attract his attention and was not interesting to watch or listen too.

Plus I enjoy the nature sounds that it adds to our home, esp. during the winter months when can't open up the windows.  The dvd is wonderful relaxing to play on cold winter day, to bring the feeling of those wonderful summer relaxing days by the pond or out in nature, at a park. relaxing, rejuvenating for all of us. Hidden bonus, did not expect to enjoy it myself.  Realized that it calms my dog through hearing the calming nature sounds. Brings calming life in the home.

1098085,A1CT3VC2YHL2NC,B000UZS9JY,John J. Schauer,"[11, 15]","I bought this DVD to help when I am dogsitting for my sister's two Italian grayhounds, but it certainly didn't attract--much less hold--their attention. It's an oddly edited mish-mash. First off, the various segments are connected with New-Age-style piano music. Is there any evidence anywhere that dogs especially enjoy New Age piano music? There are, at several totally arbitrary points, brief voice-overs of pet owners reciting short testimonials to their own pets. Perhaps a voice track saying ""good dog!"" or some such thing would register with a pet, but not the Hallmark sentiments included on this disc. The editing is far too jumpy for dogs--a continuous shot from a single camera might have worked, but animals don't understand changing camera angles and jump cuts, so as the camera leaps about during individual segments, it must be totally disorienting to them. My own experience with this, as well as other DVDs for dogs, is that they tend to become much more engaged when there are shots of other dogs, along with dog noises, and this DVD has only minimal dog footage. How can a dog possibly identify with shots of, say, flamingos if they have never seen one in real life? All in all it's an interesting and potentially effective concept, but the execution is only so-so at best.",2,NOT FOR ALL DOGS,1208736000,"04 21, 2008",2008,1292,"['bought', 'DVD', 'help', 'when', 'am', 'dogsitting', 'sister', 'two', 'Italian', 'grayhounds', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'attract', 'much', 'less', 'hold', 'attention', 'oddly', 'edited', 'mish-mash', 'First', 'various', 'segments', 'are', 'connected', 'New-Age-style', 'piano', 'music', 'evidence', 'anywhere', 'dogs', 'especially', 'enjoy', 'New', 'Age', 'piano', 'music', 'are', 'several', 'totally', 'arbitrary', 'points', 'brief', 'voice-overs', 'pet', 'owners', 'reciting', 'short', 'testimonials', 'own', 'pets', 'Perhaps', 'voice', 'track', 'saying', 'good', 'dog', 'such', 'thing', 'would', 'register', 'pet', 'not', 'Hallmark', 'sentiments', 'included', 'disc', 'editing', 'far', 'too', 'jumpy', 'dogs', 'continuous', 'shot', 'single', 'camera', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'animals', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'changing', 'camera', 'angles', 'jump', 'cuts', 'so', 'camera', 'individual', 'segments', 'must', 'be', 'totally', 'disorienting', 'own', 'experience', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'DVDs', 'dogs', 'tend', 'become', 'much', 'more', 'engaged', 'when', 'are', 'shots', 'other', 'dogs', 'dog', 'noises', 'DVD', 'only', 'minimal', 'dog', 'footage', 'How', 'can', 'dog', 'possibly', 'identify', 'shots', 'say', 'flamingos', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'one', 'real', 'life', 'interesting', 'potentially', 'effective', 'concept', 'execution', 'only', 'so-so', 'best']",N/A
