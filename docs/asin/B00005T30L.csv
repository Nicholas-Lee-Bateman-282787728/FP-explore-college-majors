681263,A204X1OJ3UOHZ,B00005T30L,"Aaron Richards ""azza_r13""","[0, 1]","For those that have read Daniel Clowes' graphic novel about the trials and tribulations of Enid and Rebecca in the post highschool graduation world, you could not ask for a better visual interpretation! Terry Zwigoff had proven his fanscination with cartoonists on the fringe with his doco 'Crumb' about Robert Crumb(the often maligned creator of Fritz the Cat amongst others).This is a great film and all the better being able to watch at home, a perfect DVD for a night in with your intelligent friends. It is always refreshing to have a good selection of special features on a disc including deleted scenes which I'm sure you have your favourite, though tell me any of these scenes would have made the film better, no way!The casting is brilliant. Thora Birch is 'Enid'up and down, forget all of these character actors like De Niro and Palcino because no actor has ever identified with their character like this. Thora plays 'Enid' as the perfect anti-hero. Steve Buscemi is inspired casting, as his face looks like it came straight out of the pages of the original comic. 'Seymour' is the ultimate loser and Steve walks and talks it well. Scarlett Johansson is great in the support as 'Rebecca',the ying to Enid's yang, perfect together and devastating apart. Each character is never at their best without the other. This film has absolutely no faults to be found with a top notch cast and great directing.This film quickly went into my all time top ten films with the recent 'Donnie Darko', also a beautiful portrayal of the teenage psyche.

Enid (more than Rebecca) is a counter-culture rebel who hates this world of frauds and losers, and she subsequently has trouble getting and keeping a job.  One day the girls decide to play a prank on a lonely middle-aged loser named Seymour.  Their plan backfires, though, and Enid becomes a little obsessed with the man.  First she feels sorry for Seymour, then he becomes something of a hero to her, and she resolves to help him at least find a girlfriend.  &quot;Maybe I just cant stand the thought of a world where a guy like you can't get a date,&quot; she tells him. Meanwhile, Enid seems to be avoiding the challenge of getting her own life started.Terry Zwigoff (&quot;Crumb&quot;) directs this film based on a script by Dan Clowes, who also created the original comic book.  &quot;Ghost World&quot; attempts to be a kitsch-free, counter-culture coming of age film, and for the most part it succeeds.  The characters are very believable, honest, and engaging.  The downbeat Seymour is wonderfully played by Steve Buscemi, and Thora Birch in her striking performance as Enid follows up her &quot;American Beauty&quot; role with another discontent, misfit teen character.  Perhaps the greatest disappointment in the film, however, is that Scarlett Johansson as Rebecca is marginalized midway through the film.  Regarding the story: It is debatable whether the film is entirely free of kitsch.  As with &quot;American Beauty,&quot; Seymour's sudden romantic options smell of middle-aged wish fulfillment.  Also, one might ask for a slightly tighter ending, as the film finishes without much resolution--except for one rather simple but touching scene between Enid and Seymour.  On the whole, however, the film is a delight, producing some very memorable characters to whom, in the end, the audience will be sorry to say goodbye.",4,Join the human race... or not.,992736000,"06 17, 2001",2001,1942,"['Best', 'friends', 'Enid', 'Rebecca', 'graduate', 'high', 'school', 'find', 'forced', 'enter', 'real', 'world', 'Enid', 'more', 'Rebecca', 'counter-culture', 'rebel', 'who', 'world', 'frauds', 'losers', 'subsequently', 'trouble', 'getting', 'keeping', 'job', 'One', 'day', 'girls', 'decide', 'play', 'prank', 'lonely', 'middle-aged', 'loser', 'named', 'Seymour', 'plan', 'though', 'Enid', 'little', 'obsessed', 'man', 'First', 'sorry', 'Seymour', 'then', 'something', 'hero', 'help', 'least', 'find', 'girlfriend', 'quot', 'Maybe', 'just', 'cant', 'stand', 'thought', 'world', 'where', 'guy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'date', 'quot', 'Meanwhile', 'Enid', 'be', 'avoiding', 'challenge', 'getting', 'own', 'life', 'started.Terry', 'Zwigoff', 'quot', 'Crumb', 'quot', 'film', 'based', 'script', 'Dan', 'Clowes', 'who', 'also', 'created', 'original', 'comic', 'book', 'quot', 'Ghost', 'World', 'quot', 'attempts', 'be', 'kitsch-free', 'counter-culture', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'believable', 'honest', 'engaging', 'downbeat', 'Seymour', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'striking', 'performance', 'Enid', 'up', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'role', 'discontent', 'misfit', 'teen', 'character', 'Perhaps', 'greatest', 'disappointment', 'film', 'however', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Rebecca', 'marginalized', 'midway', 'film', 'Regarding', 'story', 'debatable', 'film', 'entirely', 'free', 'kitsch', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'Seymour', 'sudden', 'romantic', 'options', 'smell', 'middle-aged', 'wish', 'fulfillment', 'Also', 'one', 'might', 'ask', 'slightly', 'tighter', 'ending', 'film', 'finishes', 'much', 'resolution', 'one', 'rather', 'simple', 'touching', 'scene', 'Enid', 'Seymour', 'whole', 'however', 'film', 'delight', 'producing', 'very', 'memorable', 'characters', 'whom', 'end', 'audience', 'will', 'be', 'sorry', 'say', 'goodbye']",N/A
681265,A3IAP2JMTP5YBN,B00005T30L,"adriana ""alisa""","[4, 4]","There are great films. And then there are those that touch you on a genuinely personal level.Ghost World is that film. It's a small film that won't mean as much to many people. But those that do &quot;get it&quot; will find it endlessly touching and filled with magical moments.There is no major plot, or big climax in Ghost World.It feels more like an emotional vignette of what it feels to be lost and lonely.And it captures that feeling so perfectly,with such feeling, that you'll get shivers down your spine.Perhaps this film feels so real thanks to the amazing acting and writing.Thora Birch captured her lead role absolutely perfectly.Her character doesn't really give you any reasons to sympathize with her, and at first glance, there don't seem to be many redeeming qualities about her. But she is so refreshingly human, and realistically flawed, that you can't help but feel for her.Thora Birch gives Enid dimension and range, sculpting something so much more true to life than your typical &quot;angst ridden teen&quot;.Scarlett Johansson nails her part as the more &quot;normal&quot; best friend. It's very rare than an actor with such minimal screen time is able to flesh so much dimension into her character.But that is just what she does, making every single moment of screentime with her priceless.Everything from her mannerisms, to the inflections in her voice make her a pleasure to watch.But it is Steve Buscemi,who is at the emotional core of this film, who creates one of the most real,and wonderful, and sympathetic on screen characters that I've ever seen.His performance in the film rendered me speechless-it was heartbraking and humorous at the same time.Lets not forget the superb collection of eclectic rock,jazz and blues tunes to be found in the film.And the film's score,the theme song for Ghost World was just extraordinary and added such emotion to the film. The script is abolsutely brilliant without sounding over the top.It still sounds like things people would actually say, and the fact that it manages to be so infinitely striking is a testemanet to its brilliance.The sets and costumes were also simply delightful and added a vigorous and zestful feel to the movie.The sets and costumes, and the overall appearance of the movie is simply unforgettable.And the film is endlessly witty,offering you an internal chuckle every step of the way.But perhaps what touched me about this movie the most was that it allowed itself to be so real and vulnerable.It never tried to glamorize, or make being an outcast or a lonely person seem cool like so many other brainless movies catered to a young audience have.It wasn't afarid of being emotional,and striking a chord with the viewer. And believe what you like, but this movie is by no means a &quot;teen&quot; movie.It is a deeply intelligent, and profoundly moving film that most teens wouldn't take the time to understand.The film may mislead you into thinking of it as a teen movie because it stars two teenage girls in the leads, but don't for one second assume that this is the case.Ghost World is a movie that is undefinable.You cant't recommend it to a certain age group,or a certain film preference.This film is catered to your emotions.You either feel it or you don't.Subtle,touching,full of dry wit,and deep beyond explanation Ghost World is a film that can be watched and watched and watched and watched...",5,"Poignant,Unafraid of Simplicity and Intelligence",1080259200,"03 26, 2004",2004,3396,"['are', 'great', 'films', 'then', 'are', 'touch', 'genuinely', 'personal', 'level.Ghost', 'World', 'film', 'small', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mean', 'as', 'much', 'many', 'people', 'do', 'quot', 'get', 'quot', 'will', 'find', 'endlessly', 'touching', 'filled', 'magical', 'major', 'plot', 'big', 'climax', 'Ghost', 'World.It', 'more', 'emotional', 'vignette', 'what', 'be', 'lost', 'feeling', 'so', 'perfectly', 'such', 'feeling', ""'ll"", 'get', 'shivers', 'down', 'spine.Perhaps', 'film', 'feels', 'so', 'real', 'thanks', 'amazing', 'acting', 'writing.Thora', 'Birch', 'captured', 'lead', 'role', 'absolutely', 'perfectly.Her', 'character', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'reasons', 'sympathize', 'first', 'glance', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'many', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'so', 'refreshingly', 'human', 'realistically', 'flawed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'her.Thora', 'Birch', 'Enid', 'dimension', 'range', 'sculpting', 'something', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'true', 'life', 'typical', 'quot', 'ridden', 'teen', 'quot', '.Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'part', 'more', 'quot', 'normal', 'quot', 'best', 'friend', 'very', 'rare', 'actor', 'such', 'minimal', 'screen', 'time', 'able', 'flesh', 'so', 'much', 'dimension', 'character.But', 'just', 'what', 'making', 'single', 'moment', 'screentime', 'priceless.Everything', 'mannerisms', 'inflections', 'voice', 'make', 'pleasure', 'watch.But', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'who', 'emotional', 'core', 'film', 'who', 'one', 'most', 'real', 'wonderful', 'sympathetic', 'screen', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.His', 'performance', 'film', 'rendered', 'speechless-it', 'was', 'heartbraking', 'humorous', 'same', 'time.Lets', 'not', 'forget', 'superb', 'collection', 'eclectic', 'rock', 'jazz', 'blues', 'tunes', 'be', 'found', 'film.And', 'film', 'score', 'theme', 'song', 'Ghost', 'World', 'was', 'just', 'extraordinary', 'added', 'such', 'emotion', 'film', 'script', 'abolsutely', 'brilliant', 'sounding', 'top.It', 'still', 'like', 'things', 'people', 'would', 'actually', 'say', 'fact', 'be', 'so', 'infinitely', 'striking', 'testemanet', 'brilliance.The', 'sets', 'costumes', 'were', 'also', 'simply', 'delightful', 'added', 'vigorous', 'zestful', 'feel', 'movie.The', 'sets', 'costumes', 'overall', 'appearance', 'movie', 'simply', 'unforgettable.And', 'film', 'endlessly', 'witty', 'offering', 'internal', 'chuckle', 'step', 'way.But', 'perhaps', 'what', 'touched', 'movie', 'most', 'was', 'allowed', 'be', 'so', 'real', 'vulnerable.It', 'never', 'tried', 'glamorize', 'make', 'being', 'outcast', 'lonely', 'person', 'seem', 'cool', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'brainless', 'movies', 'catered', 'young', 'audience', 'have.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'afarid', 'being', 'emotional', 'striking', 'chord', 'viewer', 'believe', 'what', 'like', 'movie', 'quot', 'quot', 'movie.It', 'deeply', 'intelligent', 'profoundly', 'moving', 'film', 'most', 'teens', 'would', ""n't"", 'take', 'time', 'understand.The', 'film', 'may', 'mislead', 'thinking', 'teen', 'movie', 'two', 'teenage', 'girls', 'leads', 'do', ""n't"", 'one', 'second', 'assume', 'case.Ghost', 'World', 'movie', 'undefinable.You', ""cant't"", 'recommend', 'certain', 'age', 'group', 'certain', 'film', 'preference.This', 'film', 'catered', 'emotions.You', 'feel', ""don't.Subtle"", 'touching', 'full', 'dry', 'wit', 'deep', 'explanation', 'Ghost', 'World', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'watched', 'watched', 'watched']",N/A

Not only they are pretty, but also they are very talented, and they usually choose to appear in independent movies rather than appear in summer Blockbusters. That generation includes interesting actresses like Sarah Polley, Christina Ricci, Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson, to name a few. Luckily in &quot;Ghost World&quot; appear Thora and Scarlett.When &quot;Ghost World&quot; was released, a lot of people, included myself, were impressed with Thora Birch, a young actress with a unique beauty and talent. So after I saw her in &quot;American Beauty&quot;, I couldn't wait to see her in another movie, and that film is &quot;Ghost World&quot;, an independent movie that explores in an unique way the complex transition of the teenage days to the &quot;real world&quot;.&quot;Ghost World&quot; has a very talented cast, in addition to Thora, we can find Scarlett Johansson and Steve Buscemi. Scarlett steals the show in &quot;Ghost World&quot;, obviously it was expected to be Thora's movie, but Scarlett is very solid in this movie and she got the attention of other independent filmmakers like Sofia Coppola, two years later, Sofia Coppola cast Scarlett to appear in &quot;Lost In Translation&quot;, so &quot;Ghost World&quot; was the &quot;commercial&quot; breakthrough of Scarlett. Plus, she is gorgeous.Steve Buscemi, another independent spirit, also steals a lot of scenes in &quot;Ghost World&quot;, we know him very well from other films like &quot;Fargo&quot; or &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;. With such acting talent, &quot;Ghost World&quot; is a must-see.

While the film focuses heavily on Enid and Seymour, the graphic novel does feature the 50's diner scene where they set up Seymour, but that's his only appearance.  Instead, it is rather more about Enid and Rebecca.

Thora Birch is amazing.  She looks like she stepped right out of the graphic novel, they are so alike in appearance.  Steve Buscemi gives off what must be the finest role he has done yet.  Brad Renfro is great as the unfortunate target of Enid and Rebecca, Josh, and Scarlett Johansson is superb as Enid's best friend, Rebecca.When it comes to DVD extras, unfortunately, this disc lacks in them.

The movie unfortunately is made to be a realistic look of a time that I would rather forget, and people that you don't always want to know.Enid is a classically angst ridden girl.  She is smart enough to know how illusion ridden the world is around her, but not smart enough to know what her part in this is.  So she and her friend are the definition of defeatist youth.  They have little ambition, like to play cruel jokes, and everything seems to exist for them to criticize.  Due to their temperment they aren't good at keeping jobs, so spend a lot of time with their artwork and practical jokes.  School wasn't over long ago, but they have few friends from the experience and it is quickly turning into faded memories.This turns around when they are looking through the I saw you ads of their local paper and find one of a lonely man who felt that something had passed between him and a girl he met at an airport.  So they make a response to the ad and arrange a meeting to see what will happen when the man shows up finds no one is coming to meet him.  This is where they meet Steve Buscemi's nerdy character, working at an office for a fried chicken company, and a vinyl junkie.They watch him and for some reason Enid becomes fascinated with him and starts befriending him and learning about his life.  Trying to break him out of his dull day by day existence.Then the film seems to take a down turn.  Enid starts to see her world quickly crumbling around her.  Her father has a new girlfriend and thinks she should move out.  Her best friend is getting frustrated with the fact that Enid isn't going anywhere and giving up on their plans.  Her attempts at holding a job with her tendency to make jokes at everything around her and temper fail miserably.I think that this movie is well made, but I just didn't like it.  The characters were realistic, the situations familar, the filming and casting had a gritty and realistic quality, but it seemed shallow in a lot of ways.  A lot of the characters just are, there is little to no background on them.Plus the main character, Enid, is extremely difficult to like.  She is too defeatist and depressing to really get into.  Her character goes from one self initiated disaster to another, her wit seeming less and less endearing, and her character seeming less and less intelligent.  There are some times when the feelings of lonlieness and confusion hit her character and you feel a spark for her.  But her tendency to take others with her when she falls ruins it.  Enid attacks people for fun or lashes out at others for her emotional problems.  You never really see why she is so hostile to everybody in her life, and this is a big part of her character. Or why she is so intersted in Steve Buschemi's character.  I also found her best friend a mystery, a girl thats just there.Though I think that the film was wonderfully made, I just didn't like it.  The characters were too defeatist and their rapid spiral downward too frustrating to want to watch twice.  As well as the many unanswered questions about the characters.I hope that the director and actress do something else that is in similar caliber, but with different material, because it shows a lot of potential.",3,Accurate about a time no one wants to remember,1091664000,"08 5, 2004",2004,3335,"['do', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'so', 'far', 'Enid', 'bitter', 'Daria', 'outsider', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'made', 'be', 'realistic', 'look', 'time', 'would', 'rather', 'forget', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'want', 'know.Enid', 'classically', 'angst', 'ridden', 'girl', 'smart', 'enough', 'know', 'how', 'illusion', 'ridden', 'world', 'not', 'smart', 'enough', 'know', 'what', 'part', 'friend', 'are', 'definition', 'defeatist', 'youth', 'have', 'little', 'ambition', 'play', 'cruel', 'jokes', 'everything', 'exist', 'criticize', 'Due', 'temperment', 'are', ""n't"", 'good', 'keeping', 'jobs', 'so', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'artwork', 'practical', 'jokes', 'School', 'was', ""n't"", 'long', 'ago', 'have', 'few', 'friends', 'experience', 'quickly', 'turning', 'faded', 'memories.This', 'around', 'when', 'are', 'looking', 'saw', 'ads', 'local', 'paper', 'find', 'one', 'lonely', 'man', 'who', 'felt', 'something', 'had', 'passed', 'girl', 'met', 'airport', 'make', 'response', 'ad', 'arrange', 'meeting', 'see', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'when', 'man', 'up', 'one', 'coming', 'meet', 'where', 'meet', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'nerdy', 'character', 'working', 'office', 'fried', 'chicken', 'company', 'vinyl', 'junkie.They', 'watch', 'reason', 'Enid', 'fascinated', 'befriending', 'learning', 'life', 'Trying', 'break', 'dull', 'day', 'day', 'film', 'take', 'down', 'turn', 'Enid', 'see', 'world', 'quickly', 'crumbling', 'father', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'should', 'move', 'out', 'best', 'friend', 'getting', 'frustrated', 'fact', 'Enid', ""n't"", 'going', 'anywhere', 'giving', 'up', 'plans', 'attempts', 'holding', 'job', 'tendency', 'make', 'jokes', 'everything', 'temper', 'fail', 'miserably.I', 'think', 'movie', 'well', 'made', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'characters', 'were', 'realistic', 'situations', 'familar', 'filming', 'casting', 'had', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'quality', 'seemed', 'shallow', 'lot', 'ways', 'lot', 'characters', 'just', 'are', 'little', 'background', 'main', 'character', 'Enid', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'like', 'too', 'defeatist', 'depressing', 'really', 'get', 'character', 'one', 'self', 'initiated', 'disaster', 'wit', 'seeming', 'less', 'less', 'endearing', 'character', 'seeming', 'less', 'less', 'intelligent', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'feelings', 'lonlieness', 'confusion', 'hit', 'character', 'feel', 'spark', 'tendency', 'take', 'others', 'when', 'Enid', 'attacks', 'people', 'fun', 'out', 'others', 'emotional', 'problems', 'never', 'really', 'see', 'why', 'so', 'hostile', 'everybody', 'life', 'big', 'part', 'character', 'why', 'so', 'intersted', 'Steve', 'Buschemi', 'character', 'also', 'found', 'best', 'friend', 'mystery', 'girl', 'thats', 'just', 'think', 'film', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'made', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'characters', 'were', 'too', 'defeatist', 'rapid', 'spiral', 'downward', 'too', 'frustrating', 'want', 'watch', 'twice', 'As', 'well', 'many', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'characters.I', 'hope', 'director', 'actress', 'do', 'something', 'else', 'similar', 'caliber', 'different', 'material', 'lot', 'potential']",N/A

What I love so much about `Ghost World' is that it understands that balance between humor and heart, and it knows that the darkest realities of loneliness and alienation use sarcasm and wit to mask themselves.  `Ghost World' feels richly honest.  This is certainly not a film that everyone will fall head over heels for; the humor alone is an acquired taste (not everyone will `get it' or find it funny) but for those of us who do `get it', this is a beautiful piece of cinema.  Thora Birch, Scarlett Johansson and Steve Buscemi are all spectacular here, especially Buscemi, who tears at the heart in ways unexpected.  Birch and Johansson find the normalcy in Clowes biting dialog, handling their lines with an ease that is richly rewarding.  The beautiful core of `Ghost World' lies in the idea that growing up comes in stages and is, as we all can attest to, very hard to do.  As the central characters are fleshed out (Enid, Rebecca and Seymour all get their room to shine) we see them interact and play off one another, and the true `thickness' of their relationships is tested and exposed.  Life isn't easy, and making that transition from childhood to adulthood is one of the hardest avenues of life.  For me, there are few films that can capture the emotional impact of the experience with as much style as `Ghost World'.",5,Won't disappear anytime soon...,1309305600,"06 29, 2011",2011,1382,"['Witty', 'sharp', 'dry', 'humor', 'indie', 'gem', 'What', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'Ghost', 'World', 'balance', 'humor', 'heart', 'darkest', 'realities', 'loneliness', 'alienation', 'use', 'sarcasm', 'wit', 'mask', 'Ghost', 'World', 'feels', 'richly', 'honest', 'certainly', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'will', 'fall', 'head', 'heels', 'humor', 'alone', 'acquired', 'taste', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'get', 'find', 'funny', 'who', 'do', 'get', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'cinema', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'are', 'spectacular', 'here', 'especially', 'Buscemi', 'who', 'heart', 'ways', 'unexpected', 'Birch', 'Johansson', 'find', 'normalcy', 'Clowes', 'biting', 'dialog', 'handling', 'lines', 'ease', 'richly', 'rewarding', 'beautiful', 'core', 'Ghost', 'World', 'lies', 'idea', 'growing', 'up', 'stages', 'can', 'attest', 'very', 'hard', 'do', 'central', 'characters', 'are', 'fleshed', 'out', 'Enid', 'Rebecca', 'Seymour', 'get', 'room', 'shine', 'see', 'interact', 'play', 'off', 'one', 'true', 'thickness', 'relationships', 'tested', 'exposed', 'Life', ""n't"", 'easy', 'making', 'transition', 'childhood', 'adulthood', 'one', 'hardest', 'avenues', 'life', 'are', 'few', 'films', 'can', 'capture', 'emotional', 'impact', 'experience', 'as', 'much', 'style', 'Ghost', 'World']",N/A

681279,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B00005T30L,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[7, 8]","Ghost World is a very comical, very dark look at American society through the eyes of two teenage misfits.  Recent high school graduates Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) are two girls who are outsiders, and that's how they like it.  They can't stand America's obsession with pop-culture, non-conformism, and retro styles.  They try to seperate themselves any way that they can.  They like to play cruel pranks on people they don't like or tell people awful things, true or false.  They hassle a boy (Brad Renfro) who works at a convenience store, they make fun of the valedictorian (Rini Bell), who is in a wheel chair and neck brace due to an accident involving alcohol, and they show up at Wowsville, a 50's nostalgia cafe that plays rap and techno music, just so they can mock the establishment to the waiters.  Neither of them are virgins, but I think that they were only messing with the guys that had sex with them (it's never directly stated, but I came to that conclusion myself, especially since their personalities would drive most guys away).  While most of the people/things that they attack deserve criticim (the valedictorian states in her speech that she no longer needs drugs, she is later seen drinking from a flask, and Wowsville is a poor excuse for a 50's diner), they still focus their time and energy on these things.  They even buy food at Wowsville, thus supporting the very thing they make fun of.  It seems as if even they can't seem to completely detatch themselves from the things they claim to hate so much.Neither of them plan on going to college, probably because it's what ""everyone"" is doing.  Instead, they try to find jobs so that they can move in together.  However, while Rebecca gets a job at a coffee shop (not Starbucks, but the same kind of place) and begins to grow up out of her high school persona, Enid is unable to either hold a job or outgrow her old, sarcastic self (which is part of the reason she can't hold onto a job).  She is perfectly happy going through life, criticizing the people and things she finds to be stupid (which is nearly everyone and everything).  Then she meets Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a middle-aged record collector who turns out to be a target of one of her pranks.  Even though she looks down on him, thinking he's a loser, she can't help but become somewhat attracted to him, both mentally and physically.  As she later states, ""He's the opposite of everything I hate"".Ghost World follows Enid, Rebecca, and Seymour over the course of the summer following their graduation.  Enid must attend a summer school art class (she failed during the year, and probably because even though she is a great artist, she doesn't conform to the teacher's nonconformist ways, if that makes sense).  Rebecca searches for apartments, while Enid shoots down her every suggestion, and the two best friends begin to pull apart.  Enid also spends a lot of time with Seymour, trying to get him to go on dates, but secretly hoping that he will ask her out.Not everyone will understand this movie.  Some people who do may find it to be too dark, or depressing, or pessimistic.

So there's no possible way I could dislike something she was in. And indeed, Ghost World was astounding in so many ways. I am Enid, in many areas, and myself and those like me are the audience this film is intended for, those of us who KNOW (not think) the majority is stupid. Those of us who KNOW pop culture is vapid, and those of us who find joy in tearing down even the most sacred of hollow traditions.However, if you want the FULL enjoyment of a movie like this, then I sincerely reccommend picking up the Ghost World screenplay. I bought it long before I saw the film, and I was blown away. So I was more than a little disappointed when a lot of what made the screenplay great was left out of the movie, like Enid's infatuation with Josh, Seymour's fight with Dana, and so on. Terry Zwigoff and Daniel Clowes put together a much better script than the final film.My only other major reservation was the extremely unfunny and unsympathetic performance by Scarlett Johansen. I understand she's supposed to be cynical and disinterested, but there were times I had to turn the volume up just to hear what she said. It was that inarticulate. She was much better in The Man Who Wasn't There, but she did absolutely nothing for this movie, and I cringed every time she talked because it just brought the movie down so much.And finally, a word to all of you who &quot;didn't get&quot; this movie: stick with American Pie.

It consists of a storyline so simple it's basically mindless, and the subject shouldn't appeal to me either because it revolves around the lives of two teenage girls. Somehow though, I enjoy it thoroughly.Anyway, after high school graduation, two girls are completely lost with what they'd like to do with their lives. Of course while watching the movie I was thinking to myself ""Why be so depressed?  You just graduated high school!  You survived 12 years of boringness!  You should be out there celebrating hard and heavy!"" but these girls weren't the party type apparently.The entire movie is about these two best friends who spend all day walking around town and either tormenting an old classmate who works at a mini mart, or meeting much older guys at record stores (such as Steve Buscemi for example, someone who is very fond of vinyl albums and knows how to impress the ladies with his music knowledge- sarcasm there, haha).  Basically, it focuses around two girls and Steve Buscemi's character.The two girls have very different personalities. One of them is much more sarcastic, direct and just has a darker attitude. The other girl is more shy, has a hoarse voice, and doesn't look for trouble or ever speak out of turn. The fact both of these personalities don't blend well makes for a *perfect* choice of main characters.Eventually the two girls slowly drift apart when they realize their lives are changing and they find themselves caught between jobs, careers and boyfriends. Again though, it's funny to assume their lives would change in such a hurry in a matter of *weeks*. They should have been out there partying every single night. Come on, 12 years of school is finally over with! Get out there and do whatever it is teens do to party their butt off!Overall, a highly enjoyable drama. I can't believe it's as good as advertised, but it's true. I guess I mainly like the dark-haired girl since the plot eventually focuses around her anyway.

Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansen) are two high school graduates who are breaking the mold by not attending college. Instead, they plan to live together and torment the pathetic suburban neighborhood that they live in. While Rebecca takes a job at a coffee shop that is begging to be called Starbucks, Enid is forced to go to summer school to earn credits for an art course that she flunked. The two collect retro knick-knacks, play off-beat music, and haunt 1950's diners. Their angst-ridden but amused camaraderie, however, is shattered when one of their pranks goes horribly wrong. After pretending to be the long lost ""blonde girl at the airport"" that a lonely man has placed an ad in the ""personals"" section to look for, Enid finds herself a soul mate. Seymour (Steve Buschemi) is a significantly older man who is awkward but sweet and sensitive and loves the same music and culture that Enid does.Gradually as everyone's lives shift around her, Enid finds her own splintering apart. Her father is contemplating marrying a repulsive former girlfriend. Seymour finally finds his ""lost girl at the airport"". Enid herself cannot keep a job and ends up flunking her art course, losing the chance to obtain a scholarship to an arts school. Even worse, Enid's relationship with Seymour alienates her from Rebecca, who is more interested in saving money and picking out apartments. Ultimately, Enid realizes that her only hope for salvation is to indulge one of her deepest fantasies and simply walk away from the life she has known.I started out really liking this movie for its quirky, off-beat characters. Apart from Enid and Rebecca themselves, there is Josh (Brad Renfro), the cashier at a local quick-mart, whom the girls alternately torment and flirt with; Josh's crazy martinet of a Greek boss along with his archenemy red-neck of a customer; Allen ""Weird Al"", the cook with the crazy hair at the 1950's diner; Norman, who faithfully waits for the bus although it was canceled two years ago; Enid's obnoxious, freaky art teacher; even a cameo by a man so lazy he requires a wheelchair and spends his time looking up the answers to trivia questions in the coffee shop Rebecca works at on his laptop. Enid's father is also by turns amusing and sympathetic as her well-meaning but stuttering father. Seeing Thora Birch continue her masterful portrayal of teenage angst after ""American Beauty"" was delightful. However, I found one of the final plot developments outrageous and quite bizarre. Seymour and Enid were, as far as I could see, just friends. I did not view them as being anything else and felt that adding this dimension to their characters did not fit with Enid's personality as being cynical and aloof from typical human passions. Therefore, I was pretty disappointed and a little freaked out towards the end, although the final scene is somewhat believable. This is one of those movies where you just want to delete one or two of the scenes and pretend they never happened and let the rest of the movie go on as it is.

Guilty, Enid feels obligated to hook him up with the girl he was looking for in the ad.What is remarkable about ""Ghost World"" is not that it is more entertaining than your average teen entertainment. No, what strikes me about ""Ghost World"" is how astutely it remembers the feeling of displacement that plagues so many teens. Enid doesn't seem to have many friends who respect her, and as cynical as she may get, human contact is the obvious ingredient missing in her life, even though she is constantly pushing it away. Rebecca urges her to get a job, so she gets a job working at a concession stand in a multiplex. That same day, she's fired for too many wise remarks about the theater and it's customers. Enid doesn't feel the need to ""fit in"", instead she sees the whole world collapsing around her and would rather observe and snicker than get away from the problem. She tries to move on with her life, yet everyone around her is trying to keep her grounded. Thora Birch seems more alive as Enid than in any other of her roles. In ""American Beauty"", she played a similar character, but I was less than convinced with her portrayal, mostly consisting of pouting. In ""Ghost World"", it is like she has woken up, and really works as Enid. Her chemistry with the other actors ranges from comfortable to repellent as the story requires.Seymour is just as miserable as Enid. He collects all kinds of junk- from jazz records to old posters from the fast-food company he works for. He wishes he could have a more rewarding career and a more exciting life. ""I hate my intrests"", he remarks. Where Enid is a little more honest and will say anything that comes to her mind, Seymour builds a shield against pain with his collections and obsessions and rarely takes a chance. Enid does not care about the consequences; Seymour is constantly running away from them. Steve Buschemi is wonderful in this role. He does what an actor should as he doesn't overact but really gets into the character and inhabits him. As we watch him, we feel just like a picture Enid draws in her sketchbook: ""Go Seymour!"" We want him to get the girl, to succeed and live happily ever after. Unfortunately, his own self-pity comes back to haunt him when he realizes he has nothing in common with the woman of his dreams.In the end, Enid is off to create a world of her own, while Seymour is left behind back where he started. He does have his experiences with Enid, but how far does that really take him? We will never find out, but we are sure that he will start to come into his own; we now have gained confidence in him. The film has that personal touch that most films lack. Coming from Terry Zwigoff, a man who threatened to commit suicide if the subject for a documentary he was making didn't cooperate (""Crumb""), it's easy to see why the film is so accurate in its portrayal of emotional emptiness. ""Ghost World"" has so many strengths to deem it one of the best films of the year. And as much as some would like to disagree, it is not a teen movie in any way, shape or form.",5,A film I can relate to,1022889600,"06 1, 2002",2002,4106,"['so-called', 'teen', 'movies', 'offered', 'recent', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'dull', 'empty', 'variation', 'basic', 'formula', 'usually', 'geek', 'who', 'girl/guy', 'nasty', 'popular', 'kids', 'jocks', 'unlikely', 'couple', 'more', 'uses', 'word', 'normal', 'person', 'able', 'tolerate', 'What', 'rare', 'treat', 'middle', 'season', 'usually', 'full', 'teen', 'movie', 'trash', 'had', 'Ghost', 'World', 'film', 'not', 'everybody', 'easily', 'accessible', 'categories', 'adults', 'teens', 'alike', '.Thora', 'Birch', 'Enid', 'high', 'school', 'grad', 'unsure', 'what', 'do', 'rest', 'life', 'will', 'rent', 'apartment', 'best', 'friend', 'Rebecca', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'job', 'summer', 'school', 'flunking', 'art', 'nothing', 'certain', 'similar', 'spot', 'Seymour', 'Steve', 'Buschemi', 'record', 'collector', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'real', 'meaning', 'actions', 'Enid', 'Rebecca', 'play', 'seemingly', 'harmless', 'prank', 'seeing', 'classified', 'ad', 'put', 'paper', 'Quite', 'surprise', 'duo', 'little', 'stunt', 'really', 'Seymour', 'Guilty', 'Enid', 'feels', 'obligated', 'hook', 'up', 'girl', 'was', 'looking', 'ad.What', 'remarkable', 'Ghost', 'World', 'not', 'more', 'entertaining', 'average', 'teen', 'entertainment', 'No', 'what', 'Ghost', 'World', 'how', 'astutely', 'feeling', 'displacement', 'so', 'many', 'teens', 'Enid', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'many', 'friends', 'who', 'respect', 'as', 'cynical', 'may', 'get', 'human', 'contact', 'obvious', 'ingredient', 'missing', 'life', 'even', 'constantly', 'pushing', 'away', 'Rebecca', 'get', 'job', 'job', 'working', 'concession', 'stand', 'multiplex', 'same', 'day', 'fired', 'too', 'many', 'wise', 'remarks', 'theater', 'customers', 'Enid', ""n't"", 'feel', 'need', 'fit', 'instead', 'whole', 'world', 'collapsing', 'would', 'rather', 'observe', 'snicker', 'get', 'away', 'problem', 'move', 'life', 'yet', 'everyone', 'trying', 'keep', 'grounded', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'more', 'alive', 'Enid', 'other', 'roles', 'American', 'Beauty', 'played', 'similar', 'character', 'was', 'less', 'convinced', 'portrayal', 'mostly', 'consisting', 'pouting', 'Ghost', 'World', 'woken', 'up', 'really', 'Enid', 'chemistry', 'other', 'actors', 'comfortable', 'repellent', 'story', 'requires.Seymour', 'just', 'as', 'miserable', 'Enid', 'kinds', 'junk-', 'jazz', 'records', 'old', 'posters', 'fast-food', 'company', 'could', 'have', 'more', 'rewarding', 'career', 'more', 'exciting', 'life', 'hate', 'intrests', 'remarks', 'Where', 'Enid', 'little', 'more', 'honest', 'will', 'say', 'anything', 'mind', 'Seymour', 'shield', 'pain', 'collections', 'obsessions', 'rarely', 'chance', 'Enid', 'not', 'care', 'consequences', 'Seymour', 'constantly', 'running', 'away', 'Steve', 'Buschemi', 'wonderful', 'role', 'what', 'actor', 'should', ""n't"", 'overact', 'really', 'character', 'watch', 'feel', 'just', 'picture', 'Enid', 'draws', 'sketchbook', 'Go', 'Seymour', 'want', 'get', 'girl', 'succeed', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'Unfortunately', 'own', 'self-pity', 'back', 'haunt', 'when', 'nothing', 'common', 'woman', 'dreams.In', 'end', 'Enid', 'create', 'world', 'own', 'Seymour', 'left', 'back', 'where', 'started', 'have', 'experiences', 'Enid', 'how', 'far', 'really', 'take', 'will', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'are', 'sure', 'will', 'start', 'come', 'own', 'now', 'have', 'gained', 'confidence', 'film', 'personal', 'touch', 'most', 'films', 'lack', 'Coming', 'Terry', 'Zwigoff', 'man', 'who', 'threatened', 'commit', 'suicide', 'subject', 'documentary', 'was', 'making', 'did', ""n't"", 'cooperate', 'Crumb', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'film', 'so', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'emotional', 'emptiness', 'Ghost', 'World', 'so', 'many', 'strengths', 'deem', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'like', 'disagree', 'not', 'teen', 'movie', 'way', 'shape', 'form']",N/A

Although it's easy to see her condition as 'existential' and somehow profound on the personal or spiritual level, it all boils down to her inability to find a role, either through love and (by implication) marriage and having children, or through work and career. This failure is not so much her fault as society's.The only jobs on offer are low paid service jobs (pop-corn seller at the multiplex) that she is too intelligent for, while the only career that might fulfill her mentally -- the artistic one that briefly opens up to her -- is closed off by a 'politically correct' backlash against her artistic honesty.The message here is:(1) be stupid and work in a dull service job, or (2) be clever and get a higher status job but at the cost of being a bland, disimulating, two-faced chimer without much integrity.This leaves only the personal realm through which to find a role, in Enid's case, men. The two relationships open to her are Josh a young guy working in a convenience store and Seymour an assistant manager at the offices of some restaurant chain.The twists and turns of the plot just go to show how unsuitable both of them turn out to be. Josh is just a dumbed down, unskilled, and downtrodden shop boy clearly lacking the intellectual depth that Enid requires. Seymour, on the other hand, has the intellectual depth, but as an office drone, ultimately lacks the courage and physical manliness to fill the role required.Rather than being groomed by society to fill balanced, healthy, natural roles, the people in this movie are either mentally emasculated (Josh), or physically emasculated (Seymour) or have their intelligence or integrity insulted (Enid) by the roles society offers them, all in the name of serving banal service industries or political correctness.Read in the right way, this is a film with a revolutionary, possibly right wing message about the necessity of men being men and women being women, and not existing as fodder for the service economy and as brainwashed sheep of political correctness.",5,Movie with a Message,1106179200,"01 20, 2005",2005,2306,"['definitely', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'impression', 'being', 'deeply', 'personal', 'poignant', 'story', 'actually', 'reflecting', 'few', 'broader', 'truths', 'points', 'social', 'concern.The', 'pivot', 'story', 'Enid', 'boredom', 'alienation', 'easy', 'see', 'condition', ""'existential"", 'somehow', 'profound', 'personal', 'spiritual', 'level', 'down', 'inability', 'find', 'role', 'love', 'implication', 'marriage', 'having', 'children', 'work', 'career', 'failure', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'fault', ""society's.The"", 'only', 'jobs', 'offer', 'are', 'low', 'paid', 'service', 'jobs', 'pop-corn', 'seller', 'multiplex', 'too', 'intelligent', 'only', 'career', 'might', 'fulfill', 'mentally', 'artistic', 'one', 'briefly', 'up', 'closed', 'off', ""'politically"", 'correct', 'backlash', 'artistic', 'honesty.The', 'message', 'here', '1', 'be', 'stupid', 'work', 'dull', 'service', 'job', '2', 'be', 'clever', 'get', 'higher', 'status', 'job', 'cost', 'being', 'bland', 'disimulating', 'two-faced', 'chimer', 'much', 'integrity.This', 'only', 'personal', 'realm', 'find', 'role', 'Enid', 'case', 'men', 'two', 'relationships', 'open', 'are', 'Josh', 'young', 'guy', 'working', 'convenience', 'store', 'Seymour', 'assistant', 'manager', 'offices', 'restaurant', 'chain.The', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'just', 'go', 'show', 'how', 'unsuitable', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'Josh', 'just', 'dumbed', 'down', 'unskilled', 'downtrodden', 'shop', 'boy', 'clearly', 'lacking', 'intellectual', 'depth', 'Enid', 'Seymour', 'other', 'hand', 'intellectual', 'depth', 'office', 'drone', 'ultimately', 'courage', 'physical', 'manliness', 'fill', 'role', 'required.Rather', 'being', 'groomed', 'society', 'fill', 'balanced', 'healthy', 'natural', 'roles', 'people', 'movie', 'are', 'mentally', 'emasculated', 'Josh', 'physically', 'emasculated', 'Seymour', 'have', 'intelligence', 'integrity', 'insulted', 'Enid', 'roles', 'society', 'name', 'serving', 'banal', 'service', 'industries', 'political', 'correctness.Read', 'right', 'way', 'film', 'revolutionary', 'possibly', 'right', 'wing', 'message', 'necessity', 'men', 'being', 'men', 'women', 'being', 'women', 'not', 'existing', 'fodder', 'service', 'economy', 'brainwashed', 'sheep', 'political', 'correctness']",N/A

Yet in her own eyes Enid (perfectly cast Thora Birch) is not an outcast but merely someone who is above all the bland and boring that is mainstream. Her best friend Rebecca (Scarlet Johansson) shares her view as they torture other losers and find their true identities. Enid's world view changes when she meets an older nerdish fellow named Seymour (Steve Buscemi), she soon finds her relationship with Rebecca slipping as a whole new world opens to her in his world of antique records and pop art.  It is also apparent that Enid is just not ready to become mainstream in a world where everything is a Ghost World of imitation and mundaneTerry Zwigoff's world is a wonderful change from the super cool yet boring as hell popular kid movies where the big worries are the prom and if Freddie Prinze, Jr will get the girl. Ghost World is for the other crowd who didn't care about the popular kids and is a welcome change. Thora Birch captures Enid so perfectly with her caustic attitude and self-loathing persona. Steve Busecimi is great as usual in portraying Seymour as a sensitive loner who is content to live in his world of classic jazz and blues nostalgia.

The film starts with Birch playing a cruel prank on Buscemi's loneliness via his ad in a personals column but she gradually becomes intrigued by him.  Although this film has a high comedic moments, it is not a comedy.  It is a very serious study of 2 people who could be voted for as most likely to be dumped on by our society and culture.  A reoccuring scene in the film, of an old man waiting for a phantom bus to carry him away from it all, perhaps captures the overall mood and trajectory of the film best.  Birch's character is fascinated by him.  When she tells him that the bus doesn't come there any more, he tells her that she doesn't know what she is talking about.  This is a metaphor for the whole film and the magical realism underlying the entire work.

The surprising bit is that I still feel the same way, more or less, about the world around me.  Young people have the uncanny ability to see the absurdity and the hypocrisy in the ""adult"" world.  Most of the young people, after they enter the world of adults, will become the ""adults"".  The character Seymour perfectly captured the essence of that rare adult who still can see the absurdity and hypocrisies among his fellow men without being bitter or sarcastic.  Sure, the world may see Seymour as a looser, but 1% of humanity will embrace him as something original.  The characters, the passing commentaries between them, and the current consumer culture it portraits remind me so much of what I've been feeling all along.

681305,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00005T30L,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[60, 71]","Dan Clowes, the only comic book artist to be nominated for an Oscar (for best screenplay this film, along with the director Terry Zwigoff), brings to life characters created in one particular storyline from his highly popular and very odd independent comic book Eightball, specifically in the unconventional film Ghost World (2001).The film, directed by Terry Zwigoff, who also directed the acclaimed biopic about underground artist Robert Crumb aptly entitled Crumb (1994) and Bad Santa (2004), stars Thora Birch as Enid, Scarlett Johansson as Rebecca, and Steve Buscemi as Seymour.  The story begins with Enid and Rebecca, who are best friends, graduating from high school.  During their slightly reflective moments of high school, we begin to learn that these two girls are among the fringe dwellers.  You may be familiar with them, as they were the kids who dressed oddly, oozed sarcasm, shunned almost all after school activities, and seemed to have a negative view of most everything, seeing what they perceived as the phoniness and superficialities rampantly inherent within their environment, and taking pleasure in tormenting and alienating those around them and purposely ostracizing themselves from their peers.  They often emit an aura of superiority, believing they are above the banalities, relishing their positions as outsiders smart enough to see through the perceived lameness, but their non-conformist attitudes often rendered them to most as snide, obnoxious losers with extremely limited social circles whose actions seemed to mask a deeper, desperately needing to belong but due to physical differences, lack of athletic abilities and just general awkwardness of youth put them in a not so unique position of never really fitting in with their peers.Anyway, as the post graduation phase sets in, Enid and Rebecca's paths begin to separate as they had originally intended to get an apartment together, which requires money ergo jobs, but Enid must take a summer school art class to complete her requirements for her high school diploma.  Rebecca, seemingly beginning to grow out of the non-conformist phase takes a job at a coffee shop understanding that her goals rely on the very real fact that things cost money, while Enid's less than heartfelt attempts at work fail miserably (her stint working in a movie theater is truly funny...Movie Patron: Do you serve beer or any alcohol? Enid: I wish. Actually you wish... after about five minutes of this movie, you're gonna wish you had ten beers.)  Through a particularly obnoxious and uncomfortable prank pulled on a completely unsuspecting and random individual, they meet Seymour, someone most would consider an unassuming loser in that he lives a very isolated life, has no misconceptions about his identity or attractiveness in general, and obsesses over rare records, devoting an entire room in his modest apartment to this pursuit. Enid later develops a relationship mostly due to the fact, in her words, `I kind of like him. He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate. In a way, he's such a clueless dork, he's almost kind of cool.'  Enid begins to identify with Seymour, someone who has excepted his loser status and has even managed to squeeze an existence out of it, while Rebecca seems to be conforming more and more to achieve a goal once shared by both girls, straining their relationship, and effectively isolating Enid even more, especially once Seymour begins to develop a relationship with a woman that Enid helped him meet, not thinking it would ever go very far...The story sort of rambles along, but seemingly with a purpose.  Certain elements appear completely odd and disconnected from any plot, but if you've ever read Eightball, you may have more of an understanding of this, as is how the comic book (graphic novel) is set up, which is one of the elements that made it so popular, at least within the individuals that followed the comic.  Offbeat, irrelevant, irregular, spooky, ethereal, sarcastic, witty, genuine, scary, sad, humorous, these are all words I would use to describe both the comic book and the film.  I was surprised to see this movie made, much more so a major studio release, as the comic didn't seem to lend itself to this kind of treatment, especially given that the main character is not one your normal viewer would like or develop much empathy for...The characters are very well developed, warts and all, and Birch is wonderful as the snotty, snooty outsider who finds life certainly isn't the same as when she was in high school, suffering, in part, to her unwillingness to grow from her childish attitudes and develop a path to follow.  Buscemi seems made for his part as Seymour `I can't relate to 99% of humanity', given his unique physical appearance and understanding created within the context of his character of his lot in life, embracing that which is comfortable, while the rest being more of a means to an end supporting his passion.  He knows what he is, but seems to harbor no ill will or outward hatred towards society in general, accepting his role in life, taking what comes his way and just going with the flow.The wide screen picture looks really sharp with matching audio.  Special features include deleted scenes, a ten minute featurette entitled Making of Ghost World which, in its' brevity and use of various scenes from the film hardly shares much of anything, a music video for the sixties Indian music sequence presented at the beginning of the film (which we see as Enid is watching it on her television), and an original theatrical trailer for the film, along with a TV spot, and a couple of other trailers for more popular films.  If you enjoyed this film, I would also recommend Crumb (1994), American Splendor (2003) and the upcoming Clowes/Zwigoff production of Art School Confidential (2004).  By the way, watch the film all the way through the credits as a nice little surprise awaits you.Cookieman108",4,"&quot;If he's so weird, why is he wearing Nikes?&quot;",1089072000,"07 6,

681306,A51IK68MWKV5R,B00005T30L,"Craig Clarke ""Somebody Dies""","[1, 2]","Director Terry Zwigoff has avoided the dreaded ""sophomore slump"" by sticking with the same theme as his acclaimed documentary Crumb--comics. Choosing to adapt Daniel Clowes' graphic novel, he has taken it to a whole new level while retaining the original's charm.The film taps into the relationships of Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlet Johansson) and their days just after graduation. They want to get an apartment together but don't yet have the money. Another obstacle is that Enid has to retake an art class in summer school.Their relationship begins to crumble when Enid decides pull an anonymous prank on an unfortunate-looking fellow named Seymour (Steve Buscemi), sitting back to watch from a distance. Afterwards, she begins to regret it and looks to learn more about him. She comes to spend more time with Seymour than with Rebecca, eventually causing the downfall of her friendship with Rebecca, Seymour's career, and her own happiness.The acting here is first-rate. The relationship between the two girls felt absolutely genuine from the start. I was immediately pulled into their lifelong friendship, never once thinking that these were simply two actresses working together for the first time. Steve Buscemi gives one of his best performances here as the collector of records who sabotages his relationships with women.

When I was in school I was the social outcast, the uncool kid who hated everyone around him because they were too normal.  It's just so funny to watch a movie like `Ghost World' and think about my own high-school days.  The entire cast, notably the two female stars Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson turn in brilliant performances as best friends whose lives change shortly after graduating high-school.Thora stars as Enid, the social outcast who hates everyone and everything normal in her peers and finds her only sense of comfort in playing cruel pranks of those she feels unworthy.  Her latest prank includes Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a 40ish vintage record collector who is lonely and reclusive and is seeking female companionship through an add in the paper.  What Enid never expected is that she would develop a crush on this man who is ""the opposite of everything I completely hate.""As Enid's relationship with Seymour develops her relationship with her best friend Becky (Scarlett Johansson) begins to suffer.  Her negativity to everything associated with Becky and their plans is starting to push them apart.  Becky is trying to establish a life apart from the dependency of her parents roof, getting a job, an apartment, but Enid and her uncertain and complete fickleness is driving a wedge into those plans.Complete with that perfect deadpan sarcasm that laces almost every word, and the brilliant dry expression-ridden performances that only `accentuate the negative', `Ghost World' works on every level to deliver a brilliant comedy that is bound to please all who watch it.",5,Brilliant satire that hits every mark just right...,1164931200,"12 1, 2006",2006,1686,"['Ghost', 'World', 'one', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'much', 'more', 'can', 'relate', 'can', 'When', 'was', 'school', 'was', 'social', 'outcast', 'uncool', 'kid', 'who', 'hated', 'everyone', 'were', 'too', 'normal', 'just', 'so', 'funny', 'watch', 'movie', 'Ghost', 'World', 'think', 'own', 'high-school', 'days', 'entire', 'cast', 'notably', 'two', 'female', 'stars', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'turn', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'best', 'friends', 'lives', 'change', 'shortly', 'graduating', 'high-school.Thora', 'stars', 'Enid', 'social', 'outcast', 'who', 'everyone', 'everything', 'normal', 'peers', 'only', 'sense', 'comfort', 'playing', 'cruel', 'pranks', 'unworthy', 'latest', 'prank', 'Seymour', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', '40ish', 'vintage', 'record', 'collector', 'who', 'lonely', 'reclusive', 'seeking', 'female', 'companionship', 'add', 'paper', 'What', 'Enid', 'never', 'expected', 'would', 'develop', 'crush', 'man', 'who', 'opposite', 'everything', 'completely', 'hate', 'Enid', 'relationship', 'Seymour', 'relationship', 'best', 'friend', 'Becky', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'suffer', 'negativity', 'everything', 'associated', 'Becky', 'plans', 'starting', 'push', 'apart', 'Becky', 'trying', 'establish', 'life', 'apart', 'dependency', 'parents', 'roof', 'getting', 'job', 'apartment', 'Enid', 'uncertain', 'complete', 'fickleness', 'driving', 'wedge', 'plans.Complete', 'perfect', 'deadpan', 'sarcasm', 'almost', 'word', 'brilliant', 'dry', 'expression-ridden', 'performances', 'only', 'accentuate', 'negative', 'Ghost', 'World', 'works', 'level', 'deliver', 'brilliant', 'comedy', 'bound', 'please', 'who', 'watch']",N/A

Hamlow,"[4, 4]","From the conspiratory frowns of disdain between Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlet Johansson) at the graduation scene, to when they both give the finger at the graduation sign outside the school, we see that our two heroines are not the typical ordinary Generation Y-ers. Both don't want to go to college like many of their peers. Rebecca at least has some vague idea, such as moving out of her parents' home and saving enough from work to get a place of her own as a first move. She does get a job at a coffee shop, where she learns about customers. ""Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody."" Sounds like me at work.They spend their first weeks of freedom following people whom Enid thinks might be Satanists, going to Wowsville, ""the Taj Mahal of fake 50's diners"" complete with a waiter they nickname Weird Al, and make caustic comments about their conformist peers, such as Melorra, a bubbly extraverted dingbat from high school whom they mimic behind her back."" With some female cajoling, they get Josh, a guy they like to torment, to drive them places. The note they leave on his apartment door is funny!Their lives begin to diverge when they play a practical joke on Seymour (Steve Buscemi) at Wowsville. They follow him home and later, Enid buys an old blues-country record at his garage sale, of which she's totally enthralled by Skip James' ""Devil Got My Woman."" From then on, she hangs with him, slowly pushing Rebecca to the sidelines.Seymour's a reclusive eccentric, collecting memorabilia from the 1930's and 1940's. Like Enid, he isn't comfortable with mainstream life. ""I can't relate to 99% of humanity."" he tells her, to which she replies, ""I can't relate to humanity either but it's not completely hopeless."" His statement of not being in the same universe rang a chord inside me. Another time, he asks her, ""You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? [You] can't connect with other people so you fill your life with...I'm just like all these other collector losers."" Fits me to a tee.Enid (with her ever-changing glasses) really has a blast at Anthony's, an adult shop, laughing and pointing at the paraphernalia inside, much to the discomfort of the other shoppers.  And check out that sexy leopard mini and black blouse she's wearing.  Rowr!Brilliant dialogue peppers this gem of a movie. Enid uses her usual sarcasm on her job at the theatre, to a popcorn customer who wants extra butter: ""Smothered in delicious yellow chemical sludge."" Seymour makes a commentary on racism in America: ""People still hate each other, they just know how to hide it better.""At the high school graduation we first see Enid in her red gown. She's also dressed in red at the end of the movie, coming full circle, meaning, that yes, she has gone through a lot during the few months after high school, but in a sense, she's still where she is, alienated by the rest of society.Contrary to what I've heard or read, Scarlet Johannsson makes an excellent compliment to Thora Birch. She's more reserved and more knowing on what's expected of her now. Thora Birch is a marvel as Enid, unsure what she wants, as she undergoes a transition period that takes her into the unknown. However, Steve Buscemi's Seymour made me think, ""Is this really the same guy who was Mr. Pink in Reservoir Dogs and that guy 'who was funny-looking in a general sort of way' in Fargo?

681311,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005T30L,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[6, 7]","I went in to Ghost World expecting an oddball comedy, so I was surprised by the nuance, depth, and emotional complexity of this film.  There are some funny moments, certainly, but the whole movie is just too deep, dark, and meaningful to be dismissed as mere comedy.  Your reaction to the film may well depend on what kind of person you are - or were back in school.  If you were cool and ran with the in crowd, you'll probably laugh - condescendingly, of course - at the losers who make up the main characters of the story.  If you were an oddball and have drunk deeply from the waters of alienation, however, you will feel a real kinship with these characters.  The only bad thing about this film is the fact that there isn't enough of Scarlett Johansson in it.  It's really all about the character of Enid (Thora Birch), an incredibly complex character who wears alienation like a crown and tries to avoid total decimation at the hands of a cruel, mixed-up life.  We start out with Enid and her friend Rebecca (Johansson), but - for obvious reasons - Rebecca has a lifeline to normalcy and makes a much better transition to post-high school existence than her friend.  The fact that her partner is crime begins to grow apart from her only makes Enid's journey all the more difficult to navigate - and there is much to fuel her contempt for the world.The plan is for Enid and Rebecca to gets jobs and rent an apartment together, playing pranks and generally complaining about how fake and stupid everyone else is in their spare time.  After Rebecca starts working, though, you can start to see that her heart's just not in their long-held plans, while Enid just sort of sleepwalks through each day with no purpose whatsoever - apart from attending the remedial art class she has to take during the summer.  She does find a project for herself, though - one extremely weird fellow named Seymour (Steve Buscemi).  Of course, it begins with her setting the hapless Seymour up on a fake blind date and watching him suffer through the internal agony of being stood up.  She follows him, though, and the two strike up an unusual friendship.  Seymour is a great collector of classic jazz and blues records and an odd assortment of other things, and he basically lives in that forgotten world he has recreated for himself.  Enid sets out to find Seymour a girlfriend - which is quite a project indeed, as Seymour is almost hopelessly undesirable in the eyes of the world (or at least the 99% of it that Enid hates so much).Then Enid's world starts closing in on her in all sorts of ways.  Always alienated, she now begins to feel completely alone, and she basically keeps sabotaging her chances of reversing course (which is an unfortunate habit most of us weirdoes seem to have).  Every day brings bad news on some front.  By this point, the comedy is basically over and done with, and the final third of the film comes across as a nuanced, poignant look at this poor soul who truly doesn't know what she is going to do with the rest of her life - or even tomorrow, for that matter.I could say more, but this is really one of those films that you can't really explain.  There's no real sense of closure when the movie ends, but that is indicative of life itself - and that is really what Ghost World is all about.  Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi give inspired performances that will stay with you, Scarlett Johansson is marvelous, and some oddball characters (such as Numchuck Guy) round the film out quite well.  It's quirky, but quirky is almost always good.  I'm not sure how older people will react to this sort of film, but the younger generation will see much of themselves somewhere in this weird story, making Ghost World one of the most impressive coming-of-age movies of the new millennium.",5,Quirky brilliance with a most unexpected depth,1123286400,"08 6, 2005",2005,3794,"['went', 'Ghost', 'World', 'expecting', 'oddball', 'comedy', 'was', 'surprised', 'nuance', 'depth', 'emotional', 'complexity', 'film', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'certainly', 'whole', 'movie', 'just', 'too', 'deep', 'dark', 'meaningful', 'be', 'dismissed', 'mere', 'comedy', 'reaction', 'film', 'may', 'well', 'depend', 'kind', 'person', 'are', 'were', 'back', 'school', 'were', 'cool', 'ran', 'crowd', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'condescendingly', 'course', 'losers', 'who', 'make', 'up', 'main', 'characters', 'story', 'were', 'oddball', 'have', 'drunk', 'deeply', 'waters', 'alienation', 'however', 'will', 'feel', 'real', 'kinship', 'characters', 'only', 'bad', 'thing', 'film', 'fact', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'really', 'character', 'Enid', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'incredibly', 'complex', 'character', 'who', 'alienation', 'crown', 'tries', 'avoid', 'total', 'decimation', 'hands', 'cruel', 'mixed-up', 'life', 'start', 'out', 'Enid', 'friend', 'Rebecca', 'Johansson', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'Rebecca', 'lifeline', 'normalcy', 'much', 'better', 'transition', 'post-high', 'school', 'existence', 'friend', 'fact', 'partner', 'crime', 'grow', 'apart', 'only', 'Enid', 'journey', 'more', 'difficult', 'navigate', 'much', 'fuel', 'contempt', 'world.The', 'plan', 'Enid', 'Rebecca', 'jobs', 'rent', 'apartment', 'together', 'playing', 'pranks', 'generally', 'complaining', 'how', 'fake', 'stupid', 'everyone', 'else', 'spare', 'time', 'Rebecca', 'working', 'though', 'can', 'start', 'see', 'heart', 'just', 'not', 'long-held', 'plans', 'Enid', 'just', 'sort', 'sleepwalks', 'day', 'purpose', 'whatsoever', 'apart', 'attending', 'remedial', 'art', 'class', 'take', 'summer', 'find', 'project', 'herself', 'one', 'extremely', 'weird', 'fellow', 'named', 'Seymour', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'course', 'setting', 'hapless', 'Seymour', 'up', 'fake', 'blind', 'date', 'watching', 'suffer', 'internal', 'agony', 'being', 'stood', 'up', 'though', 'two', 'strike', 'unusual', 'friendship', 'Seymour', 'great', 'collector', 'classic', 'jazz', 'blues', 'records', 'odd', 'assortment', 'other', 'things', 'basically', 'forgotten', 'world', 'recreated', 'Enid', 'out', 'find', 'Seymour', 'girlfriend', 'quite', 'project', 'indeed', 'Seymour', 'almost', 'hopelessly', 'undesirable', 'eyes', 'world', 'least', '99', '%', 'Enid', 'so', 'much', '.Then', 'Enid', 'world', 'closing', 'sorts', 'ways', 'Always', 'alienated', 'now', 'feel', 'completely', 'alone', 'basically', 'sabotaging', 'chances', 'reversing', 'course', 'unfortunate', 'habit', 'most', 'seem', 'have', 'day', 'bad', 'news', 'front', 'point', 'comedy', 'basically', 'done', 'final', 'third', 'film', 'across', 'nuanced', 'poignant', 'look', 'poor', 'soul', 'who', 'truly', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'going', 'do', 'rest', 'life', 'even', 'tomorrow', 'matter.I', 'could', 'say', 'more', 'really', 'one', 'films', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'explain', 'real', 'sense', 'closure', 'when', 'movie', 'indicative', 'life', 'really', 'what', 'Ghost', 'World', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'give', 'inspired', 'performances', 'will', 'stay', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'marvelous', 'oddball', 'characters', 'such', 'Numchuck', 'Guy', 'round', 'film', 'quite', 'well', 'quirky', 'quirky', 'almost', 'always', 'good', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'older', 'people', 'will', 'react', 'sort', 'film', 'younger', 'generation', 'will', 'see', 'much', 'somewhere', 'weird', 'story', 'making', 'Ghost', 'World', 'one', 'most', 'impressive', 'coming-of-age', 'movies', 'new', 'millennium']",N/A

681313,A27CFNHYZG6WS8,B00005T30L,darragh o'donoghue,"[6, 6]","No matter how unmanagable, anti-social or hopeless a teenager is, it's always assumed that it's just a phase, that eventually you will take your proper place in society, get a job and home, begin relationships, have a family, generally contribute to your community and society, if only by paying tax.  this process should be increasingly likely is you are as pretty, intelligent, witty, self-assured and creative as Enid in 'Ghost World'.  but what if you don't?  what happens if you bypass or postpone the 'right' decisions?  You find yourself out of the loop, outgrown by friends, ignored by family, a lack of social identity resulting in lack of identity full stop.  You become a ghost, and 'Ghost World' is a film defined by absence and lack - of people not having what they want, with major decisions taken by others as if they didn't exist; when even your ideal better half is more of a waning shadow.  Some of the crucial scenes pivoting on Enid's life occur when she isn't even there.  in such a scenario, familiar reality, with its hierarchies and compartments and classification, stops looking familiar and real, becomes a ghost world of grotesques, empty dream landscapes, randomness, spectral impossibilities.  But you can disappear from and for everyone except yourself - Enid is afflicted with an infernal self-consciousness.'Ghost World' is a very funny and smart film, the ultimate teen movie.  But because the reassuring resolutions and socialisations of the teen movie are dislocated, it is an incredibly sad, almost tragic film, a kind of downbeat accompaniment to 'Amelie', another heroine as ghostlike manipulator of others' lives, threatened with her own empty solitude.'Ghost World' is based on a celebrated graphic novel by Daniel Clowes, and this aesthetic is pushed (for the first time on film it seems to me) to powerful emotional effect.  As in a comic book, the characters are mostly one-dimensional, often caricatures, the film's look broad and flat - even Enid's front of calm, contemptuous self-assurance.  the emotion of the film, as in the classic Hollywood melodrama, is displaced onto the bright, almost day-glo colours; onto the wonderful clothes Enid wears (increasingly red, tactlessly suggesting the border between adolescence and adulthood she is reluctant to cross); onto the locales, especially Enid's and Seymour's rooms, beautiful pop culture attempts to reveal personalities ignored in the real world; onto the rich musical soundtrack, from Hindi rock'n'roll to classic, eerie country and blues; to Zwigoff's creeping, methodical camerawork.  For the patient viewer, the pay-off is devastating, in an accumulative, low-key way.this faith in popular culture (Enid's remarkable illustrated diary; graffiti; porn shops; jumble sales; old corporate logos etc.), the transient, quickly obsolescent, quickly rewritten or surpressed alternative history of America, of our own lives, the ghosts that won't stay buried, forms a merciful release from the current mind-numbing obfuscations of both high and low culture.

Its as though he used Clowes' basic characterization and plot structure to present his own frustrations with society, art, and cinema. Zwigoff uses the relationship between characters as a foil to the frustration of the creative individual in such a regimented market-driven country.

However, some scenes become serious and inspirational, giving the audiences the realisms of the characters' behaviors.  This proves the cruel humor voiced by the characters, not the writers.  The writers combine everything wonderfully and uniquely.Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi act her characters delightfully, receiving Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor.  Their chemistry perfects their roles as a critical teaser and an unpopular man.  She joking acts as the blonde from his newspaper ad, therefore standing him up on a date.  Unexpectedly, they meet days later in his record selling sale.  She buys one and soon becomes influenced by more than the music.  The scenes beyond this gives Thora Birch's character more conflict and backlash against all of her other aquaintances, especially her best friend.  All other character, major or minor, are unforgettably funny, making the movie incomplete without them.  Many unexpected events occur, leaving the audience anxious for the next scene.

This is a terifically offbeat love story that deserved a larger audience than it got, though maybe Enid wouldn't think so.

The film started as I suspected it would and I immediately felt put upon for being talked into watching yet another mindless teen movie filled with teen pranks and teen nonsense.  I am not, mind you, anti-teen having been one myself many years ago and knowing many fine ones now that I am entering the twilight of my years, but when all is said and done, if you have seen one teen movie, you have seen them all.Well after watching the film for just a bit they switched horses on me and I now have to admit that I was wrong.The plot has already been summarized here to no end and there are a number of great reviews already posted which will give you a great blow by blow account so I will be rather brief.  This is the story of primarily thee very disenfranchised individuals; two young, one older who is a quirky sort of way represent an growing subculture in our society today.  These are the people who drift among us and indeed, are some of us, that go unnoticed for the most part.  Everyone knows these folks; young and old.  They are the quirky kids in school that really do not fit in and are those that we like to call ""under achievers."" They are with us; but at the same time they are not.Two young girls, recently graduated from high school, become involved with an older man...just friends, and all share the common loneliness, disassociation and mindless boredom which have over taken a large segment of our society.  Sort of shopping, dead end jobs, escape into meaningless hobbies and meaningless or non existent goals.  No beginning, no middle and when it comes to the end - what now?  It is much like the old song, ""Is that all there is?""The actors in this film are perfect.  Lines are delivered in a dead-pan sort of way along with all facial expressions.  I am not sure how the actors pulled this off, but pull it off they did.  There are some truly funny scenes in this one in an understated sort of way and many lines that are delivered equally as well.  The viewer needs to be aware of this and watch closely.I personally found this film to be extremely sad on so very many levels.  I suppose that the saddest part of the whole thing is that there was so much truth being told here.  If we all look at our own lives carefully, we may quite well find something of ourselves in these characters and the situation they find themselves in.For me, an added bonus was the fact that I am a big fan of the underground artist Robert Crumb.  Wow, does this film have him written all over it.I don't feel this movie is for everyone; no, most certainly not.  It will be one you will either ""get"" and love, or one that you thoroughly hate.  I do know that in my case, it will be quite some time before this one leaves my mind.  Actually, truth be told, I am going to have to watch this one again simply because I am not at all sure if I ""got"" it all with just one viewing, especially when you consider my mind-set going into this thing.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks",5,DEPRESSING AND HAUNTING...I DID LIKE THIS FILM!,1321660800,"11 19, 2011",2011,3103,"['have', 'fought', 'sometime', 'now', 'urgings', 'several', 'people', 'see', 'film', 'finally', 'buckled', 'pressure', 'gave', 'shot', 'film', 'started', 'suspected', 'would', 'immediately', 'felt', 'put', 'being', 'talked', 'watching', 'yet', 'mindless', 'teen', 'movie', 'filled', 'teen', 'pranks', 'teen', 'nonsense', 'am', 'not', 'anti-teen', 'having', 'been', 'one', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'knowing', 'many', 'fine', 'ones', 'now', 'am', 'entering', 'twilight', 'years', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'teen', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'all.Well', 'watching', 'film', 'just', 'bit', 'switched', 'horses', 'now', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'wrong.The', 'plot', 'already', 'been', 'summarized', 'here', 'end', 'are', 'number', 'great', 'reviews', 'already', 'posted', 'will', 'give', 'great', 'blow', 'blow', 'account', 'so', 'will', 'be', 'rather', 'brief', 'story', 'primarily', 'thee', 'very', 'disenfranchised', 'individuals', 'two', 'young', 'one', 'older', 'who', 'quirky', 'sort', 'way', 'represent', 'growing', 'subculture', 'society', 'today', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'drift', 'indeed', 'are', 'go', 'unnoticed', 'most', 'part', 'Everyone', 'folks', 'young', 'old', 'are', 'quirky', 'kids', 'school', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'fit', 'are', 'like', 'call', 'achievers', 'are', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'not.Two', 'young', 'girls', 'recently', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'become', 'involved', 'older', 'man', 'just', 'friends', 'share', 'common', 'loneliness', 'disassociation', 'mindless', 'boredom', 'have', 'over', 'taken', 'large', 'segment', 'society', 'Sort', 'shopping', 'dead', 'end', 'jobs', 'escape', 'meaningless', 'hobbies', 'meaningless', 'non', 'existent', 'goals', 'beginning', 'middle', 'when', 'end', 'what', 'now', 'much', 'old', 'song', 'actors', 'film', 'are', 'perfect', 'Lines', 'are', 'delivered', 'dead-pan', 'sort', 'way', 'facial', 'expressions', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'actors', 'pulled', 'off', 'pull', 'off', 'did', 'are', 'truly', 'funny', 'scenes', 'one', 'understated', 'sort', 'way', 'many', 'lines', 'are', 'delivered', 'equally', 'as', 'well', 'viewer', 'be', 'aware', 'watch', 'closely.I', 'personally', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'extremely', 'sad', 'so', 'very', 'many', 'levels', 'suppose', 'saddest', 'part', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'truth', 'being', 'told', 'here', 'look', 'own', 'lives', 'carefully', 'may', 'quite', 'well', 'find', 'something', 'ourselves', 'characters', 'situation', 'find', 'in.For', 'added', 'bonus', 'was', 'fact', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'underground', 'artist', 'Robert', 'Crumb', 'Wow', 'film', 'have', 'written', 'it.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'movie', 'everyone', 'most', 'certainly', 'not', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'will', 'either', 'get', 'love', 'one', 'thoroughly', 'hate', 'do', 'know', 'case', 'will', 'be', 'quite', 'time', 'one', 'mind', 'Actually', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'am', 'going', 'have', 'watch', 'one', 'again', 'simply', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'got', 'just', 'one', 'viewing', 'especially', 'when', 'consider', 'mind-set', 'going', 'thing.Don', 'BlankenshipThe', 'Ozarks']",N/A
681320,AAOT8ZNO94H0V,B00005T30L,Dean Anderson,"[3, 4]","Ghost World is a cleaned up and slightly happier adaptation of the graphic novel by Daniel Clowes. I can't help but compare the two lead characters, Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) to MTV's animated anti-heroes, Daria and Jane. Their attitude and their approach to life is in the same vein, and Daria fans will definitely get a kick out of this film.Enid and Rebecca, finishing up high school, are starting to deal with life but aren't really sure what that means. They are as cynical as you would expect two hip teens who rule their town to be, and that means criticizing everything in sight.Enid reaches a turning point when she meets Seymour (Steve Buscemi) after playing a practical joke on him. He's a nebbishy collector of 78 rpm jazz discs and even he admits to being a loser himself. Yet, Enid still enters his world and finds out some things about him, his favorite music, herself and her feelings about life, all of which she uses in her make up art class to earn her diploma. What she doesn't count on is how all of her relationships change because of it. And they change in a drastic way.Besides the film's story, both amusing and brutal in that ""teen angst"" way, the look of it is just brilliantly done. It bursts, like a comic book, with vivid color and that adds to the overall tone. And a great, great soundtrack of vintage blues gives it the perfect musical note.Birch and Johansson are both stellar in their roles. And Buscemi does his typical convincing work in what could have been a caricature part. Also notable are the great supporting performances by Brad Renfro as the convenience store clerk pal of the pair, Illeana Douglas as the damaged art instructor and Bob Balaban as Enid's dad.The disc also features some nifty extras, including the full music video of the song that opens the film, and some very funny outtakes and extended scenes with the shirtless guy at the mini mart, plus a short ""making of"" documentary and a couple of other goodies.Highly recommended.",4,Sweet And Low,1102032000,"12 3, 2004",2004,2013,"['Ghost', 'World', 'cleaned', 'up', 'slightly', 'happier', 'adaptation', 'graphic', 'novel', 'Daniel', 'Clowes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'compare', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'Enid', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'Rebecca', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'MTV', 'animated', 'anti-heroes', 'Daria', 'Jane', 'attitude', 'approach', 'life', 'same', 'vein', 'Daria', 'fans', 'will', 'definitely', 'get', 'kick', 'film.Enid', 'Rebecca', 'finishing', 'up', 'high', 'school', 'are', 'starting', 'deal', 'life', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'are', 'as', 'cynical', 'would', 'expect', 'two', 'hip', 'teens', 'who', 'rule', 'town', 'be', 'criticizing', 'everything', 'sight.Enid', 'turning', 'point', 'when', 'Seymour', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'playing', 'practical', 'joke', 'nebbishy', 'collector', '78', 'rpm', 'jazz', 'discs', 'even', 'being', 'loser', 'Enid', 'still', 'world', 'out', 'things', 'favorite', 'music', 'feelings', 'life', 'make', 'up', 'art', 'class', 'earn', 'diploma', 'What', ""n't"", 'count', 'how', 'relationships', 'change', 'change', 'drastic', 'film', 'story', 'amusing', 'brutal', 'teen', 'angst', 'way', 'look', 'just', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'comic', 'book', 'vivid', 'color', 'overall', 'tone', 'great', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'vintage', 'blues', 'perfect', 'musical', 'note.Birch', 'Johansson', 'are', 'stellar', 'roles', 'Buscemi', 'typical', 'convincing', 'work', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'caricature', 'part', 'Also', 'notable', 'are', 'great', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Brad', 'Renfro', 'convenience', 'store', 'clerk', 'pal', 'pair', 'Illeana', 'Douglas', 'damaged', 'art', 'instructor', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'Enid', 'dad.The', 'disc', 'also', 'nifty', 'extras', 'including', 'full', 'music', 'video', 'song', 'film', 'very', 'funny', 'outtakes', 'extended', 'scenes', 'shirtless', 'guy', 'mini', 'mart', 'short', 'making', 'documentary', 'couple', 'other', 'goodies.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Enid says, ""Aren't you going to answer that?""Seymour says, ""I have no desire to talk to anyone who wants to talk to me.""He picks it up anyway and listens and then says, ""That's my mother.""I just about cracked up.Well, the whole movie cracked me up.  It's a work of art from indie auteur Terry Zwigoff whom I recall as the director of the edgy documentary Crumb (1994).  For some reason, as I was watching this, I thought it was directed by Todd Solondz who directed the amazingly real and funny Welcome to the Doll House (1995).  I imagined this as a kind of high school/out of high school progression from the junior high school of Welcome to the Doll House.  It could be, actually, with Thora Birch playing an older Dawn Weiner and having all those bad things happen to her, but still managing to survive it all.  Both Enid Coleslaw and Dawn Weiner are amazingly true to life and also amazingly talented and unappreciated outsiders in this arbitrary and capricious world.  Birch (whom I remember vividly from American Beauty 1999) in her glasses and all those campish outfits over her rather ample figure was just outstanding.Scarlett Johansson who plays her friend Rebecca was as vivid as my high school date on prom night and actually prettier (I have to admit).  She was also outstanding.  Both Johansson and Birch are charismatic in a way that will glue your eyes to the screen.  They play ultra cynical slackers who love to satirize the world and their fellow creatures as they hide their vulnerability from themselves.  They are so cute.Steve Buscemi plays Seymour, a kind of autobiographical alter ego of cartoonist Daniel Clowes (thus Enid's last name, ""Coleslaw"") who wrote the comic from which he and Zwigoff adapted the movie.  Buscemi manages a tricky part calling for old school dorkishness, vulnerability and self-consciousness portrayed in an ultimately winning and sympathetic way.There are a lot of amusing insider ""trivia"" comments about this movie at IMDb, including the fact that Sophie Crumb, daughter of Robert Crumb, did the drawings in Enid's notebook.  One of the most amusing is this: ""The actor who plays the high school principal in the graduation scene also plays one of the customers in the porno shop. This was not intentional--Terry Zwigoff cast him as a porno shop customer forgetting that he also played the principal.""Right.See this for Zwigoff who has the eye and the ear of a genius, a man who knows the hearts of his characters and the mass culture they live in, and how to satirize them both, but gently with affection.",5,"No ghosts, but funny in a sweet and melancholy way",1178755200,"05 10, 2007",2007,2578,"['phone', 'rings', 'Enid', 'Are', ""n't"", 'going', 'answer', 'Seymour', 'have', 'desire', 'talk', 'anyone', 'who', 'talk', 'up', 'anyway', 'listens', 'then', 'mother', 'just', 'cracked', 'up.Well', 'whole', 'movie', 'cracked', 'up', 'work', 'art', 'indie', 'auteur', 'Terry', 'Zwigoff', 'whom', 'recall', 'director', 'edgy', 'documentary', 'Crumb', '1994', 'reason', 'was', 'watching', 'thought', 'was', 'directed', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'who', 'directed', 'amazingly', 'real', 'funny', 'Welcome', 'Doll', 'House', '1995', 'imagined', 'kind', 'high', 'school/out', 'high', 'school', 'progression', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'Welcome', 'Doll', 'House', 'could', 'be', 'actually', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'playing', 'older', 'Dawn', 'Weiner', 'having', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'still', 'managing', 'survive', 'Enid', 'Coleslaw', 'Dawn', 'Weiner', 'are', 'amazingly', 'true', 'life', 'also', 'amazingly', 'talented', 'unappreciated', 'outsiders', 'arbitrary', 'capricious', 'world', 'Birch', 'whom', 'remember', 'vividly', 'American', 'Beauty', '1999', 'glasses', 'campish', 'outfits', 'rather', 'ample', 'figure', 'was', 'just', 'outstanding.Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'who', 'friend', 'Rebecca', 'was', 'as', 'vivid', 'high', 'school', 'date', 'prom', 'night', 'actually', 'prettier', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'also', 'outstanding', 'Johansson', 'Birch', 'are', 'charismatic', 'way', 'will', 'glue', 'eyes', 'screen', 'play', 'ultra', 'cynical', 'slackers', 'who', 'love', 'satirize', 'world', 'fellow', 'creatures', 'hide', 'vulnerability', 'are', 'so', 'cute.Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Seymour', 'kind', 'autobiographical', 'alter', 'ego', 'cartoonist', 'Daniel', 'Clowes', 'thus', 'Enid', 'last', 'name', 'Coleslaw', 'who', 'wrote', 'comic', 'Zwigoff', 'adapted', 'movie', 'Buscemi', 'tricky', 'part', 'calling', 'old', 'school', 'dorkishness', 'vulnerability', 'self-consciousness', 'portrayed', 'ultimately', 'winning', 'sympathetic', 'way.There', 'are', 'lot', 'amusing', 'insider', 'trivia', 'comments', 'movie', 'IMDb', 'including', 'fact', 'Sophie', 'Crumb', 'daughter', 'Robert', 'Crumb', 'did', 'drawings', 'Enid', 'notebook', 'One', 'most', 'amusing', 'actor', 'who', 'high', 'school', 'principal', 'graduation', 'scene', 'also', 'one', 'customers', 'porno', 'shop', 'was', 'not', 'intentional', 'Terry', 'Zwigoff', 'cast', 'porno', 'shop', 'customer', 'forgetting', 'also', 'played', 'principal', 'Right.See', 'Zwigoff', 'who', 'eye', 'ear', 'genius', 'man', 'who', 'hearts', 'characters', 'mass', 'culture', 'live', 'how', 'satirize', 'gently', 'affection']",N/A

681323,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00005T30L,D. Litton,"[9, 11]","Director Terry Zwigoff has just done the impossible: he has created the first movie about teens that will appeal more to adults than to teens themselves. More than just another run-of-the-mill teenage movie, &quot;Ghost World&quot; is a striking black comedy that deals with being different, and while it's certainly not the first film to showcase outcast teenagers, it's definitely the most invigorating.Based on the original underground comic book by Daniel Clowes, the film follows the lives of best friends Enid and Rebecca, who could not be happier to have graduated high school. With them, they carry their rejection of all things popular, angst for their air-headed, well-to-do classmates, and dreams that have nothing to do with college, education, or anything outside of working and living in an apartment together.Feeling mischievous one afternoon, they come across a personals ad in the newspaper, and decide to reply with an invitation to meet the mystery man at a retro diner. This practical joke later becomes a threat to their friendship, as Enid's fascination with Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a middle-aged music lover with similar social outsider traits, begins to block out her bond with Rebecca and their dream of sharing an apartment.The two girls are played by actresses Thora Birch (&quot;American Beauty&quot;) and Scarlet Johansson (&quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot;), who form the most believable best friend duo of the year. As Enid, Birch has a great knack for sarcasm, employing a wonderfully adept use of facial expressions and humorous wit that provides most of the film's comedic moments. Johansson's character is more reserved, and she handles the transitions in Rebecca's life with effective results. And Buscemi is quite the outsider as Seymour; his character's differences are given such an excellent treatment by his acting.Clowes's screenplay is a perfect balance of humor and drama, providing us with a mixed bag of emotions that blend together very effectively. The first half of the film, devoted to the development of the friendship between Enid and Rebecca after graduation, is a canvas of lightweight jokes and situational humor resulting from their unabashed actions. Since we are given the chance to become acquainted with the two, the second half of the film is easier to connect with.As the characters begin to separate into their own worlds, the story leaves much of the humor behind and takes on a serious demeanor, that which is none-the-less affecting. As Enid's future hangs in the balance, I was willing to stay with the film, eager to see her resolve her self-conflicts and achieve a state of happiness. This leads to an ending that some will dispute over for its ambiguity, though it allows us the decision of whether or not the movie ends happily; it all depends on your own attitude.Dense and filled with magnificent acting and a terrific sense of humor, &quot;Ghost World&quot; is one of the best movies of the year, and one of the most involving films to come along in some time. The laughs are fresh and utterly original, while the story provides a unique look at all things abnormal. The film dares to ask the question, &quot;What is normal?&quot; through its characters, yet leaves us with no simplified answer to this difficult point.",5,A witty and delectable black comedy.,1005091200,"11 7, 2001",2001,3292,"['Director', 'Terry', 'Zwigoff', 'just', 'done', 'impossible', 'created', 'first', 'movie', 'teens', 'will', 'appeal', 'more', 'adults', 'teens', 'More', 'just', 'run-of-the-mill', 'teenage', 'movie', 'quot', 'Ghost', 'World', 'quot', 'striking', 'black', 'comedy', 'deals', 'being', 'different', 'certainly', 'not', 'first', 'film', 'showcase', 'outcast', 'teenagers', 'definitely', 'most', 'invigorating.Based', 'original', 'underground', 'comic', 'book', 'Daniel', 'Clowes', 'film', 'lives', 'best', 'friends', 'Enid', 'Rebecca', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'happier', 'have', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'carry', 'rejection', 'things', 'popular', 'angst', 'air-headed', 'well-to-do', 'classmates', 'dreams', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'college', 'education', 'anything', 'working', 'living', 'apartment', 'together.Feeling', 'mischievous', 'one', 'afternoon', 'come', 'personals', 'ad', 'newspaper', 'decide', 'reply', 'invitation', 'meet', 'mystery', 'man', 'retro', 'diner', 'practical', 'joke', 'later', 'threat', 'friendship', 'Enid', 'fascination', 'Seymour', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'middle-aged', 'music', 'lover', 'similar', 'social', 'outsider', 'traits', 'block', 'out', 'bond', 'Rebecca', 'dream', 'sharing', 'apartment.The', 'two', 'girls', 'are', 'played', 'actresses', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'Scarlet', 'Johansson', 'quot', 'Horse', 'Whisperer', 'quot', 'who', 'form', 'most', 'believable', 'best', 'friend', 'duo', 'year', 'Enid', 'Birch', 'great', 'knack', 'sarcasm', 'employing', 'wonderfully', 'adept', 'use', 'facial', 'expressions', 'humorous', 'wit', 'most', 'film', 'comedic', 'moments', 'Johansson', 'character', 'more', 'reserved', 'transitions', 'Rebecca', 'life', 'effective', 'results', 'Buscemi', 'quite', 'outsider', 'Seymour', 'character', 'differences', 'are', 'given', 'excellent', 'treatment', 'acting.Clowes', 'screenplay', 'perfect', 'balance', 'humor', 'drama', 'providing', 'mixed', 'bag', 'emotions', 'blend', 'together', 'very', 'effectively', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'devoted', 'development', 'friendship', 'Enid', 'Rebecca', 'graduation', 'canvas', 'lightweight', 'jokes', 'situational', 'humor', 'resulting', 'unabashed', 'actions', 'are', 'given', 'chance', 'become', 'acquainted', 'two', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'easier', 'connect', 'characters', 'begin', 'separate', 'own', 'worlds', 'story', 'much', 'humor', 'serious', 'demeanor', 'none-the-less', 'affecting', 'Enid', 'future', 'hangs', 'balance', 'was', 'willing', 'stay', 'film', 'eager', 'see', 'resolve', 'self-conflicts', 'achieve', 'state', 'happiness', 'ending', 'will', 'dispute', 'over', 'ambiguity', 'decision', 'not', 'movie', 'happily', 'own', 'attitude.Dense', 'filled', 'magnificent', 'acting', 'terrific', 'sense', 'humor', 'quot', 'Ghost', 'World', 'quot', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'year', 'one', 'most', 'involving', 'films', 'come', 'along', 'time', 'laughs', 'are', 'fresh', 'utterly', 'original', 'story', 'unique', 'look', 'things', 'abnormal', 'film', 'ask', 'question', 'quot', 'What', 'normal', 'quot', 'characters', 'simplified', 'answer', 'difficult', 'point']",N/A

at my local video store.One day I decided to just check it out and I was very very glad.The movie was filled with great things.The acting was great,the plot was great,the score was excellant,and just the combination of every thing put together.It all makes one great two hours of comendy and drama,and it just makes you think alot about things.Even though the movie is not a teen movie there are teens in it making it good for everybody who is a teen and above.The movie does have alot of profanity which makes it not for children but everybody eles is ok.The is definatly one of the greatest movies of all time.The cast is consisted to about 5 main characters.Those main characters are Enid who is played by Thora Birch,Scarlett Johansson,Steve Buscemi,Brad Renfero,and Illiana Douglas.Steve Buscemi and Scarlett Johansson are two of my favorite actors and they shine on the screen in this movie while Thora Birch who I never saw in anything didn't have me to much.Even though she was very good in the movie I just never knew how to rate her.Illiana Douglas I only saw on an episode of Frasier where in the credits I aroused myself to one simple question.Who the heck is Brad Renfero?The plot is focused around Enid(Thora Birch)and Rebbeca(Scarlett Johansson)who just graduated from hign school and are planning to skip collage and move in with each other.They are very different from other people and seem to always be in there own little world as they love to pester there friend Josh who works ay a grocery store called the Sidewinder where a trouble maker loves to hang out at and basecially cause trouble.One day they follow two Satanists and end up at a 50's theme diner.There they decide to call a man who wrote a ad in the personals asking about is some girl remembered him from a couple of days ago.They decide to call and pretend to be her and then they watch as he gets stood up by no one.Enid ends up befriending the man whose name is Seymour(Steve Buscemi)and one things leads after anthor and then by the end of the summer her whole life is turned upside down.Ghost World was very different then what I thought it was going to be like.One of the greatest elements

Usually, the teen turns out to be right about everything, and the grown-ups are just cretins with no concept of how the real world works.  American Beauty is a great example.  Thankfully, this movie doesn't trot down that path, Enid (played by an excellent Thora Birch) is cynical and distrustful of everything and everyone.  She plays horrible pranks on people and basically likes no one.  That changes when she meets Seymour (played by an always great Steve Buscemi).  She says he is &quot;everything I don't hate&quot; or something along those lines.  It's those kind of lines that give you an idea of the attitude this movie has.  It's quite an honest film that confronts many different issues, and does a better job than most movies that only take on one.  All the performances are excellent, and the direction is subtle, only after a few viewings do the images start to jump out at you.  It does have a few of those moments that make me want to vomit, such as the guy who finally gets his bus.

Lambeth,"[8, 18]","It's not a movie that will make you laugh, and one that isn't terribly entertaining, either, though I had huge expectations for the movie (I'm a huge Buscemi fan) and read excellent reviews for the movie.Honestly, it seems like this movie makes fun of the people who watch it and call it 'brilliant'. A girl gets fired from her job at the theatre for not conforming to socially acceptable behaviour...and seems to lose her friend, keep herself from getting a boyfriend, and gets confused in every area of her life because of her boredom of conformity. What makes this brilliant? 'The dialogue is so real'. Big deal. I could watch a flower blooming on a movie screen, but even though it's 'real' doesn't make it entertaining.Some reviewers have shown excitement over the old man at the bus stop scenes in the movie, where he'd basically tell our hero to shut up and go away every time she'd try to convince him that the bus stop is no longer a part of a bus route. This can be compared to the art teacher's reaction to one of her student's scribbling as being a remark on feminism. The makers of the movie put unspectacular characters and unspectacular dialogue on a screen, throw in a few overboard characters to try to create a laugh, and they're hoping people would see the hipness of such blah that they'd convince themselves that they're smart for figuring out the brilliance of the movie.If you're not into kidding yourself about what you're watching, here's what you'll see: Steve Buscemi in his most boring role...as unspectacular as his character from 28 days. Thora Birch, a cute girl with a baby face on a woman's body, dressing in interesting clothing and making negative comments about everything. The negative dialogue is probably supposed to be funny, but it isn't. It's not annoying or upsetting or anything. It's just kinda Blah. Her friend in the movie is Blah. The events of the movie are blah. There's a freaky lookin' guy who frequents the local AM/PM and keeps spouting his American Freedoms. He was pretty funny in outrageous he was, as was the stereotypical greek AM/PM owner (Apu of the Simpsons).Like the movie it's trying to copy, American Beauty, we have a wuss of a parent, some bitter teens, and some freaks. We don't have American Beauty's dialogue. I have no idea why the father was so afraid of his daughter, but to be honest, I really couldn't care less. I didn't care that his daughter had a crush on a boy that clearly wasn't an example of non-conformity (he was just a good looking, hardly-speaking boy).You have two ways to go with this movie. You might be like me and feel like this movie is a waste of your time and not interesting in the least. It had a few funny moments, and I did laugh out loud about three times in the movie. I didn't hate the movie. It just wasn't interesting or entertaining and I'll never see it again.You might also be like those who finds independent films brilliant just because of the fact that they're independent films. You'll analyze this movie to death and make much more out of this movie than is actually there. I suppose that's what the makers of the movie probably want from you. And I think that's what they're trying to make fun of.Pigeon.",2,"Realistic, but not entertaining",1021248000,"05 13, 2002",2002,3217,"['not', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'one', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'entertaining', 'either', 'had', 'huge', 'expectations', 'movie', ""'m"", 'huge', 'Buscemi', 'fan', 'read', 'excellent', 'reviews', 'movie.Honestly', 'movie', 'fun', 'people', 'who', 'watch', 'call', ""'brilliant"", 'girl', 'fired', 'job', 'theatre', 'not', 'conforming', 'socially', 'acceptable', 'behaviour', 'lose', 'friend', 'keep', 'getting', 'boyfriend', 'confused', 'area', 'life', 'boredom', 'conformity', 'What', 'brilliant', 'dialogue', 'so', 'real', 'Big', 'deal', 'could', 'watch', 'flower', 'blooming', 'movie', 'screen', 'even', ""'real"", ""n't"", 'make', 'entertaining.Some', 'reviewers', 'have', 'shown', 'excitement', 'old', 'man', 'bus', 'stop', 'scenes', 'movie', 'where', ""'d"", 'basically', 'tell', 'hero', 'shut', 'up', 'go', 'away', 'time', ""'d"", 'try', 'convince', 'bus', 'stop', 'no', 'longer', 'part', 'bus', 'route', 'can', 'be', 'compared', 'art', 'teacher', 'reaction', 'one', 'student', 'scribbling', 'being', 'remark', 'feminism', 'makers', 'movie', 'put', 'unspectacular', 'characters', 'unspectacular', 'dialogue', 'screen', 'throw', 'few', 'overboard', 'characters', 'try', 'create', 'laugh', ""'re"", 'hoping', 'people', 'would', 'see', 'hipness', 'such', 'blah', ""'d"", 'convince', ""'re"", 'smart', 'figuring', 'out', 'brilliance', 'movie.If', ""'re"", 'not', 'kidding', 'what', ""'re"", 'watching', 'here', 'what', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'most', 'boring', 'role', 'as', 'unspectacular', 'character', '28', 'days', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'cute', 'girl', 'baby', 'face', 'woman', 'body', 'dressing', 'interesting', 'clothing', 'making', 'negative', 'comments', 'everything', 'negative', 'dialogue', 'probably', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', ""n't"", 'not', 'annoying', 'upsetting', 'anything', 'just', 'kinda', 'Blah', 'friend', 'movie', 'Blah', 'events', 'movie', 'are', 'blah', 'freaky', 'lookin', 'guy', 'who', 'local', 'AM/PM', 'spouting', 'American', 'Freedoms', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'outrageous', 'was', 'was', 'stereotypical', 'greek', 'AM/PM', 'owner', 'Apu', 'Simpsons', 'movie', 'trying', 'copy', 'American', 'Beauty', 'have', 'wuss', 'parent', 'bitter', 'teens', 'freaks', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'American', 'Beauty', 'dialogue', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'father', 'was', 'so', 'afraid', 'daughter', 'be', 'honest', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'daughter', 'had', 'crush', 'boy', 'clearly', 'was', ""n't"", 'example', 'non-conformity', 'was', 'just', 'good', 'looking', 'hardly-speaking', 'boy', 'have', 'two', 'ways', 'go', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'feel', 'movie', 'waste', 'time', 'not', 'interesting', 'least', 'had', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'did', 'laugh', 'loud', 'three', 'times', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'movie', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'entertaining', ""'ll"", 'never', 'see', 'again.You', 'might', 'also', 'be', 'who', 'finds', 'independent', 'films', 'brilliant', 'just', 'fact', ""'re"", 'independent', 'films', ""'ll"", 'analyze', 'movie', 'death', 'make', 'much', 'more', 'movie', 'actually', 'there', 'suppose', 'what', 'makers', 'movie', 'probably', 'want', 'think', 'what', ""'re"", 'trying', 'make', 'fun', 'of.Pigeon']",N/A

I thought this was going to be another ""Daria"", the ""Beavis and Butthead"" spinoff.  In that cartoon, the character Daria has a lot of good cynical observations about other people, but in the end, Daria really doesn't have anything of her own to offer, so it ends up as whining.Which is where I thought this one was going.  You have a couple of very intelligent recent high school graduates that, we are led to believe, participated in absolutely nothing in their four years, mostly because it was beneath them.  They are snobs about just about anything except themselves, but like Daria, contribute virtually nothing to make them interesting on their own.But this turns out to be just character establishment, and if you give the movie a chance, you see how life continues to chip away at the suits of armor the girls wear against the world. The blonde, Scarlett Johansson, cracks first.  She lowers herself to actually get a job, and even though she still agrees that most of her customers are idiots, she starts to see that, well, that's what people are.  And like it or not, you still have to exist with others to some degree.The unrecognizable, but still brilliant Thora Birch holds out a lot longer.  She makes almost no attempt to get a job, and with the one she gets, she refuses to play the game.  When she first meets the Steve Buscemi character, it's to humiliate him, then try to help what she sees as a total loser.  In her world, practically everyone is a loser, but if they are a big enough loser, this makes them cool to some degree, and worthy of attention.  There is a lot of mental work to be done when one has this personality.Besides the slow unraveling of the girls' shields, the movie is also great by not having a neatly wrapped up ending, either happy or sad.  Enid (Birch) finds that because she's bothered when people reject her, this must mean that she actually must care for these people, and therefore, must have feelings.  We don't see any clear direction of where she's going, but we do see an awakening.  She will probably never totally play the game, but with seven billion people in the world, there might be more than one that are worth associating with.",4,Gets better as it goes along,1018310400,"04 9, 2002",2002,2275,"['will', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Daria', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'spinoff', 'cartoon', 'character', 'Daria', 'lot', 'good', 'cynical', 'observations', 'other', 'people', 'end', 'Daria', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'own', 'offer', 'up', 'whining.Which', 'where', 'thought', 'one', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'couple', 'very', 'intelligent', 'recent', 'high', 'school', 'graduates', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'participated', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'four', 'years', 'mostly', 'was', 'beneath', 'are', 'snobs', 'just', 'anything', 'Daria', 'contribute', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'make', 'interesting', 'own.But', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'character', 'establishment', 'give', 'movie', 'chance', 'see', 'how', 'life', 'chip', 'away', 'suits', 'armor', 'girls', 'wear', 'world', 'blonde', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'cracks', 'first', 'actually', 'get', 'job', 'even', 'still', 'most', 'customers', 'are', 'idiots', 'see', 'well', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'still', 'have', 'exist', 'others', 'degree.The', 'unrecognizable', 'still', 'brilliant', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'out', 'lot', 'longer', 'almost', 'attempt', 'get', 'job', 'one', 'play', 'game', 'When', 'first', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'character', 'humiliate', 'then', 'try', 'help', 'what', 'total', 'loser', 'world', 'practically', 'everyone', 'loser', 'are', 'big', 'enough', 'loser', 'cool', 'degree', 'worthy', 'attention', 'lot', 'mental', 'work', 'be', 'done', 'when', 'one', 'slow', 'unraveling', 'girls', 'shields', 'movie', 'also', 'great', 'not', 'having', 'neatly', 'wrapped', 'up', 'ending', 'happy', 'sad', 'Enid', 'Birch', 'bothered', 'when', 'people', 'reject', 'must', 'mean', 'actually', 'must', 'care', 'people', 'therefore', 'must', 'have', 'feelings', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'clear', 'direction', 'where', 'going', 'do', 'see', 'awakening', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'totally', 'play', 'game', 'seven', 'billion', 'people', 'world', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'one', 'are', 'worth', 'associating']",N/A

Sixteen Candles was (AND still is) a great coming-of-age movie, just so no one thinks I'm ""dissing"" it. In any case the trailer for GHOST WORLD, shall we say, was incomplete.The movie offers so much more depth than you'd get from seeing the trailer. Thora Birch and Scarlett Johannson and Steve Buscemi all give us some of the best character-driven performances you will see in ANY movie from the past year. I didn't read the graphic novel the movie was based on, but it seems that the screenwriters and director have done a great job of translating it to film.I think everyone who sees this movie will see bits of themselves in both Enid and Rebecca's lives. The feelings of not fitting in with your peer groups, not feeling attractive, not knowing what you're going to do with your life after graduation, etc. etc. will ring true with most of the movie's audience.The relationship between Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi's characters is at the same time, complex and touching. When you see the movie, you'll understand how two unlikely people do make for good friends, even though they meet in an unconventional way. To tell you how they do would give away one of the movie's charming surprises.My only negative comment would be that the ending is ambiguous and left me with one big question and no real direction for any answers.

Having planned to move into an apartment together, their plans immediately face obstacles. Rebecca gets a job and starts to conform to a lifestyle Enid wants no part of. Rebecca matures and sees the reality of needing money to live independently, while Enid wants to linger in this adolescent-aimless-loser phase (ruining all her job possibilities almost as soon as they start). One of her pranks leads her to meet Seymour (Steve Buscemi) a middle-aged loser of sorts whose one passion in life is collecting rare records.

Enid and her friend Rebecca have just graduated high school and they are expected to be a certain way and to do certain things.  While Rebecca falls seamlessly into the complacent category of conformity, Enid is constantly plagued with the individualism that has kept her from the mainstream her entire life.  However, her rebellion will lead her to choices that, perhaps for her, were not the best to be made and will lead her down a path of abandonment, a feeling that most teenagers and young adults face around this crucial time of change.Enid befriends a middle-aged man named Seymour who seems just as lonely as she.  Enid finds him interesting and begins to hang around him which leads to a multitude of humorous exchanges.  But when Seymour also moves on with his life, the determined Enid who wishes to remain unchanged, is forced yet again to pursue other routes of individuality, driving her down the unknown road of the future.Based off of the graphic novel, Ghost World focuses on the teenager and young adult during the tumultuous time where mandatory education falters and critical life choices arise.  Everything, from people to ideas, become hazy and indeterminate, like the ether of ghosts.  People, places, and things drift out of existence and into the dim past as everyone moves forward.  Those, like Enid, who seem to revolt against the very idea of moving forward are stuck in a limbo situation where confusion and loneliness dwell.  Despite this grim outlook, we tend to love Enid and her eccentric nature and hope that she can find some stability in her life.Despite the described message, the movie is lighthearted, witty, and fun.  It does not try to take itself too seriously for fear of drifting too far into the drama category and abandoning the essential comic relief.  It also should be mentioned that the movie isn't your typical kind of film.  Characters enter and disappear, even though it feels like they should have a larger role (e.g. Josh), because the movie focuses on Enid's life and the idea that permanence is not an option.

Enid and Rebecca are two misfits who have just graduated out of high school.  While Rebecca gets a job to try to get her own apartment and move forward into adulthood, Enid is still struggling to try to find her place in a new world.  This is obvious by her reluctance to get a job and move forward.  After pulling a prank on a lonely older man, she somehow ends up becoming a friend of his while breaking away from Rebecca.Enid is a character you sometimes get angry with but at the same time understand that she is having trouble moving forward in life and feel empathy for.  She has a lot of talent yet no idea on what exactly it is she wants to do.  So she turns to the outcasts such as the crazy old man who sits waiting for a bus that never comes and the older Seymour.This film is often sad but hilarious too.  You are always wondering just where this film will take you.  Even the end is the perfect touch though some might not care for it. Its a great film that is actually real and honest.

To be honest, the beginning of this review sounds like this movie...a movie about not being sure of where you want to go, what you want to do, and who you want to be.Enid and Rebecca are best buds who have just graduated from high school.  Rebecca shoots right out and gets a job, goes apartment hunting, and is eager to get out into the world and be like everyone else.  Enid isn't sure.  In fact, Enid isn't sure of much of anything, even what color hair she wants or if she wants to be an artist or what she thinks of her dad's new girlfriend.Along the way, Enid decides to play a game on a single older man named Seymour...and ends up becoming deeply involved in his life.  I wonder if its because she sees something of herself in him--strange, doesn't quite fit in, might never comes to much of anything.This story ambles along and is both sad and funny in parts.  Steve Buscemi is brilliant, as ever, and what got me to buy this movie in the first place.  That, plus the wonderful Bollywood inspired opening scene that Enid is dancing to in the beginning.  The DVD includes a full copy of it and it makes me want to find a copy of the original movie it is from.Not a happy movie, but a strange one and one that will ressonate with you if you were ever in Enid's shoes.",3,Oddly Entertaining,1365033600,"04 4, 2013",2013,1371,"['movie', 'strange', 'like', 'strange', 'might', 'like', 'movie', 'Then', 'again', 'maybe', 'not', 'be', 'honest', 'beginning', 'review', 'movie', 'movie', 'not', 'being', 'sure', 'where', 'want', 'go', 'what', 'want', 'do', 'who', 'want', 'be.Enid', 'Rebecca', 'are', 'best', 'buds', 'who', 'have', 'just', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'Rebecca', 'shoots', 'right', 'out', 'job', 'apartment', 'hunting', 'eager', 'get', 'out', 'world', 'be', 'everyone', 'else', 'Enid', ""n't"", 'sure', 'fact', 'Enid', ""n't"", 'sure', 'much', 'anything', 'even', 'what', 'color', 'hair', 'be', 'artist', 'what', 'dad', 'new', 'girlfriend.Along', 'way', 'Enid', 'play', 'game', 'single', 'older', 'man', 'named', 'Seymour', 'up', 'becoming', 'deeply', 'involved', 'life', 'wonder', 'something', 'herself', 'strange', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'might', 'never', 'much', 'anything.This', 'story', 'ambles', 'sad', 'funny', 'parts', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'brilliant', 'ever', 'what', 'got', 'buy', 'movie', 'first', 'place', 'wonderful', 'Bollywood', 'inspired', 'opening', 'scene', 'Enid', 'dancing', 'beginning', 'DVD', 'full', 'copy', 'want', 'find', 'copy', 'original', 'movie', 'from.Not', 'happy', 'movie', 'strange', 'one', 'one', 'will', 'ressonate', 'were', 'ever', 'Enid', 'shoes']",N/A

It's the place where the bus no longer runs, except in the mind of an old man on the bench. ""Ghost World"" is where everyone has big hair, drives an SUV, wears designer clothers, listens MOR radio, and suffocates their children with benign platitudes and unwanted attention. It's tough to be a kid in ""Ghost World"" where your choices are limited to joining the ""in-crowd"" or, developing a highly refined sense of irony, as does our heroine, Enid.""Ghost World"" is a brilliantly conceived film by Zwigoff, the director of the riveting documentary about the life and times of undergound comic artist, R.Crumb.  Steve Bushemi plays Seymour, a charmingly eccentric collector of odd cultural artifacts who sometimes appears to be an alter-ego aforementioned Mr. Crumb. Thora Birch's Enid, is a directionless recent high school graduate (sort of) who has lost her bearings in a sea of suburban mediocrity. You will seldom see a more tender and complex relationship portrayed as the relationship between by Bushemi and Birch. They are two doomed outsiders who view the transparency of human relationships with intelligent irony. This is a small movie that should be a runaway success, but never will be.

681340,A1ZS82R4RC0I2N,B00005T30L,gonn1000,"[1, 1]","An underrated yet excellent movie, &quot;Ghost World&quot; is an enticing indie offering from director Terry Zwigoff. Yes, it`s another movie about teenagers, still it`s far from being a useless collection of jokes glued together a la &quot;American Pie&quot; or &quot;Roadtrip&quot;. Instead, this film, inspired by the Daniel Clowes` underground comic, focuses meaningful themes like alienation, consumism, (sub)culture and the first steps into the adult world.Thora Birch plays Enid, a clever, creative yet confused suburban young girl straight out of highschool. She and her friend Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) must face a new and unpredictable future where they have to be on their own and face multiple and relevant choices. They never seemed to really fit in, and for the first time realize that pherhaps they should. But is it worth it? And what`s the price to pay?Zwigoff manages to combine drama and comedy with great effect, delivering a cinematic experience that is satirical and ironic while being poignant and emotional as well. In a way, it`s like MTV`s show &quot;Daria&quot;, but in this movie the results are more deep, intense and relateable.At times, the pacing is a bit slow, still it makes sense since the story focuses some points like the everyday mundane monotony and suburban inertia where nothing interesting or gripping seems to happen.&quot;Ghost World&quot; is also a twisted, witty and original coming-of-age story, focusing the nerds, geeks and losers that are as clever and brilliant as they are ignored and virtually invisible (like ghosts). As a result, they don`t have much of a social life and remain incapable of relating with most of those who surround them. Enid is such a character, and when she dares to try helping someone she ends up being used and hurt.One of the most innovative and surprising independent movies of the last years, &quot;Ghost World&quot; is a little gem worth discovering that gets better with each viewing. Probably most, or at least many people won`t like it much, since this is not a typical, laugh-a-minute and brainless teen movie, but a thought-provoking and genuine cinematic experience. Still, for those who try to get deep into it, it will surely be a memmorable and unique film to watch.Related movies: &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;, &quot;American Splendor&quot;, &quot;SubUrbia&quot;, &quot;The Good Girl&quot;, &quot;Storytelling&quot;, &quot;American Beauty&quot;, &quot;L.I.E.&quot;, all very good choices as well",4,Melancholy and the Infinite Sadness,1079049600,"03 12, 2004",2004,2487,"['underrated', 'yet', 'excellent', 'movie', 'quot', 'Ghost', 'World', 'quot', 'enticing', 'indie', 'offering', 'director', 'Terry', 'Zwigoff', 'Yes', 's', 'movie', 'teenagers', 'still', 's', 'far', 'being', 'useless', 'collection', 'jokes', 'glued', 'together', 'la', 'quot', 'American', 'Pie', 'quot', 'quot', 'Roadtrip', 'quot', 'Instead', 'film', 'inspired', 'Daniel', 'Clowes', 'underground', 'comic', 'meaningful', 'themes', 'alienation', 'consumism', 'sub', 'culture', 'first', 'steps', 'adult', 'world.Thora', 'Birch', 'plays', 'Enid', 'clever', 'creative', 'yet', 'confused', 'suburban', 'young', 'girl', 'straight', 'highschool', 'friend', 'Rebecca', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'must', 'face', 'new', 'unpredictable', 'future', 'where', 'have', 'be', 'own', 'face', 'multiple', 'relevant', 'choices', 'never', 'seemed', 'really', 'fit', 'first', 'time', 'realize', 'pherhaps', 'should', 'what', 's', 'price', 'pay', 'Zwigoff', 'combine', 'drama', 'comedy', 'great', 'effect', 'delivering', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'satirical', 'ironic', 'being', 'poignant', 'emotional', 'as', 'well', 'way', 's', 'MTV', 's', 'show', 'quot', 'Daria', 'quot', 'movie', 'results', 'are', 'more', 'deep', 'intense', 'relateable.At', 'times', 'pacing', 'bit', 'slow', 'still', 'sense', 'story', 'points', 'everyday', 'mundane', 'monotony', 'suburban', 'inertia', 'where', 'nothing', 'interesting', 'gripping', 'happen.', 'quot', 'Ghost', 'World', 'quot', 'also', 'twisted', 'witty', 'original', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'focusing', 'nerds', 'geeks', 'losers', 'are', 'clever', 'brilliant', 'are', 'ignored', 'virtually', 'invisible', 'ghosts', 'result', 'don', 't', 'have', 'much', 'social', 'life', 'remain', 'incapable', 'relating', 'most', 'who', 'surround', 'Enid', 'such', 'character', 'when', 'try', 'helping', 'someone', 'up', 'being', 'used', 'hurt.One', 'most', 'innovative', 'surprising', 'independent', 'movies', 'last', 'years', 'quot', 'Ghost', 'World', 'quot', 'little', 'gem', 'discovering', 'better', 'viewing', 'Probably', 'most', 'least', 'many', 'people', 'won', 't', 'much', 'not', 'typical', 'laugh-a-minute', 'brainless', 'teen', 'movie', 'thought-provoking', 'genuine', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'Still', 'who', 'try', 'get', 'deep', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'memmorable', 'unique', 'film', 'watch.Related', 'movies', 'quot', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'quot', 'quot', 'American', 'Splendor', 'quot', 'quot', 'SubUrbia', 'quot', 'quot', 'Good', 'Girl', 'quot', 'quot', 'Storytelling', 'quot', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'quot', 'L.I.E.', 'quot', 'very', 'good', 'choices', 'as', 'well']",N/A

Instead of being smug and overly quirky like many indie films can be, this film is genuine, intelligent, and humanistic as well.  I atttribute this to the director, Terry Zwigoff, who directed one of my favorite documentaries, Crumb, and the two excellent leads, Steve Buscemi and Thora Birch.  Buscemi here is especially good, playing a character that could have easily turned into a caricature with a lesser director and actor.  Buscemi plays a lonely 42 year old bachelor who lives with an astonishing record collection.  Some may have portrayed him with snark and made him look like a loser, but Buscemi and Zwigoff give him humanity and soul, and it makes for one of Buscemi's greatest performances.  He's really underrated as an actor.  Birch is excellent, too, as the sarcastic, yet human girl who takes a liking to Buscemi.  Again, their romance feels real, and she seems to genuinely like him, despite the differences in age.  It's not forced, sleazy, and it's not done for the sake of being quirky.

The day after I saw it, I went to Blockbuster to bring it back and was ready to buy it but.....THEY DIDN'T HAVE IT! What a joke! I mean, seriously, some of their movies for sell are horrid and they don't have Ghost World?This movie is quite original and is one of the few movies without any violence whatsoever. The movie is about two friends, Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) who just graduated from high school. They have no plans to go to college but instead plan on moving in together in their own place. Enid is mad because she has to go to summer art school and doesn't really get along with her dad or his girlfriend. She doesn't have any friends besides Rebecca and Josh, a guy whom she enjoys bugging. Rebecca and her basically just spend their days mocking people and following random people around, criticizing and laughing at them. Their newest victim is Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a nerd that sells records for a living. But, Enid starts to really like him and they become good friends. While Rebecca and Enid's relationship goes downhill, Enid's relationship with Seymour gets stronger.My interprtation of this movie to me is that most of the people are ghosts, especially to Enid, meaning that she can't realte to them and doesn't get along with them, therefore, she can't even see them. This line by Enid perfectly explains the title: ""I can't relate to 99% of humanity.""This movie will make you cry, laugh your head off, nodd in agreement and more. Some moments are downright hilarious while others are very sad. This is one movie that I will never forget. NEVER.Lastly, the acting in the movie is incredible, notably by Thora Birch. She is a rising sensation that showed off all of her talent in this movie. Steve Buscemi is also quite remarquable in a supporting role.

At first I thought Enid and Rebecca were just a couple of silly mean girls who enjoyed belittling other people - the old misery loves company story. But after watching it for a while it got under my skin.  I'm sure every guy who watched the movie fell in love with Enid even though Rebecca was more attractive.  Enid felt bad that she had messed with Seymour's life and felt she had to do something to make it better.  After using false pretenses to meet the guy, she volunteers to get him dates. She tells him that soon he will be up to his ears in pussy. However, later she becomes jealous and upset that he had not made a move on her.  Of course poor Seymour being 29 years her senior never thought he had a chance with her even though she was plain. Rebecca comes across as stuck up and callous.  She thinks Seymour is creepy.The ending was ambiguous.  Some believe the unscheduled empty bus to nowhere was symbolic of Enid's (supposed) suicide.  My first thought at the end was that the entire story was a figment of Seymour's imagination.  The ending shows Seymour in a session with his shrink who was anxious to get rid of him and Seymour's mother was waiting at the door and immediately ask him what he wanted for dinner.  That tells me that Seymour lived with his mother and was not all up there, certainly capable of dreaming all this up.",5,I'm Seymour,1359936000,"02 4, 2013",2013,1490,"['have', 'trouble', 'seeing', 'past', 'colorful', 'language', 'movie', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'you.I', 'saw', 'Sundance', 'am', 'considering', 'buying', 'DVD', 'first', 'thought', 'Enid', 'Rebecca', 'were', 'just', 'couple', 'silly', 'mean', 'girls', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'belittling', 'other', 'people', 'old', 'misery', 'company', 'story', 'watching', 'while', 'got', 'skin', ""'m"", 'sure', 'guy', 'who', 'watched', 'movie', 'fell', 'love', 'Enid', 'even', 'Rebecca', 'was', 'more', 'attractive', 'Enid', 'felt', 'bad', 'had', 'messed', 'Seymour', 'life', 'felt', 'had', 'do', 'something', 'make', 'better', 'using', 'false', 'pretenses', 'meet', 'guy', 'get', 'dates', 'soon', 'will', 'be', 'up', 'ears', 'pussy', 'However', 'later', 'jealous', 'upset', 'had', 'not', 'made', 'move', 'course', 'poor', 'Seymour', 'being', '29', 'years', 'senior', 'never', 'thought', 'had', 'chance', 'even', 'was', 'plain', 'Rebecca', 'stuck', 'up', 'callous', 'Seymour', 'creepy.The', 'ending', 'was', 'ambiguous', 'believe', 'unscheduled', 'empty', 'bus', 'nowhere', 'was', 'symbolic', 'Enid', 'supposed', 'suicide', 'first', 'thought', 'end', 'was', 'entire', 'story', 'was', 'figment', 'Seymour', 'imagination', 'ending', 'shows', 'Seymour', 'session', 'shrink', 'who', 'was', 'anxious', 'get', 'rid', 'Seymour', 'mother', 'was', 'waiting', 'door', 'immediately', 'ask', 'what', 'wanted', 'dinner', 'Seymour', 'lived', 'mother', 'was', 'not', 'up', 'there', 'certainly', 'capable', 'dreaming', 'up']",N/A

681350,A192KEPM0HW6AC,B00005T30L,"Interplanetary Funksmanship ""Swift lippin', e...","[19, 21]","""Ghost World"" was the best movie I've seen in a LONG damn time.  The key to a great movie is that it's its own world --a self-contained universe.  ""Bringing Up Baby"" is one such example, so is ""Vertigo"" and ""For a Few Dollars More.""  Any of Billy Wilder's movies, too.  This one was one of them.I love Enid.  A teenage H.L. Mencken, she skewers pretentious poseurs and tips over sacred cows.  But, underneath her outer punk persona, there is a soft-hearted hero-worshipper.  Her predicament is that she's stranded on a social desert island and uses cynicism as a shield to protect her from the hopeless banality in which heroes and passion are deemed passe by people who walk through life questioning nothing, but just parroting the answers they've picked up from the larger society.""Ghost World"" abounds in social commentary, but doesn't fall into the schmaltzy trap of trying to ""solve"" the world's social ills.  Although on the surface Enid is directionless, she nonetheless has a mania for sketching a diary of the oddballs and weirdos that make up her small town.  An excellent artist and charicaturist, Enid ends up failing art class TWICE.Her airheaded hippy/burnout art teacher, Roberta (Illeana Douglas), is a walking cliche of a total conformist affecting an air of anti-authoritarianism.  She blows off Enid's diary and her cartoons of Don Knotts, but pushes her students to instead produce so-called ""controversial"" art.  A really dead-on scene is when one of Roberta's sycophantic students creates a sculpture out of coathangers, which represents ""a woman's right to choose, something I feel super-strongly about.""  It's a gem of a parody on political art in which the politics are much stronger than the art.  I was rolling on the floor when Roberta's real bad college art film ""Mirror/Father/Mirror"" clip was playing. God damn, that rings true.  Roberta doesn't encourage the artistic impulse so much as pushing her agenda on the students to be ""controversial"" and ""confront people's attitudes.""So, Enid decides to spoof Roberta and bring in a ""found object"" of a Jim Crow charicature from the 1920s of ""Coon's Chicken,"" which depicts a monkey-like negro.  This pisses off the other students (who were sotto voce receiving the message that they should only confront people with PC controversy), but the irony of the movie is in how Roberta reacts to the Jim Crow poster; Enid can't get the time of day from her when it comes to her own talented artwork, but her jokes on Roberta's inanities wins Roberta over to her cause and even inspires Roberta to get Enid a scholarship to art college.  All this falls apart when Roberta enters the piece in an exhibit, and the local censors force her to remove the poster and fail Enid in her class.  Her capitulation reveals her devotion to ""controversy"" and ""confrontation"" to be a hollow pose, and she covers her [rear] by letting Enid be the lamb to the slaughter.The relationship between Enid and Seymour (Steve Buscemi) evinces Enid's yearnings to find someone to look up to, rather than down upon.  I liked Steve Buscemi a lot.  I'm so used to him playing funny roles, that it was sort of incongruous seeing him play it (mostly) straight in a comedic movie, but it worked quite well. Like Enid, Seymour is a middle-aged outcast, and at first becomes the victim to one of Enid's and her best friend Rebecca's (Scarlett Johansson) cruel pranks.  But underneath the nerdish and pitiful exterior, Enid comes to discover in Seymour someone as isolated and alientated from society as she is.  She finds in him a noble soul, whose passions are worn less on his sleeve than Enid's are, but locked up in his 1920s-themed room dedicated to his 78 rpm blues and ragtime records and poster art from the same era.  Enid sees in Seymour a lot of herself, but also someone who has been run over once too many times in life and whose social rebellions have shrivelled into repressed loneliness.  Enid finds in Seymour a hero, and gushes ""I'd kill for a room like this"" when complimenting his passion for nostalgia.  To which Seymour -- who has given up on the possibility of ever fitting in or finding love -- replies ""go ahead, kill me.""By the movie's end, Seymour starts asserting his inwardly pent-up feelings to relate to the world through his romance with Enid.  Finally getting up the nerve to break up with Dana, a nice, though conventionally-thinking person, in order to be with Enid, who shares his passions, and thinks like he does, Seymour nonetheless has his love for Enid somewhat unrequited. Just as the revelation that Seymour deserves happiness manifests itself, Enid alientates herself from the world -- and the two people she most treasured in the world, Seymour and Rebecca.  A happy ending does not win the day, because Enid is compelled to travel down the same lonely path that Seymour has.  Perhaps in twenty years, she will have become what he is now.As I recall, this movie was nomimated for absolutely NOTHING by the Academy of Motion Pictures ""Arts and Sciences.""  And yet, this was the best movie in a year barren of talent, originality and true cinematic art.

It's certainly not another teen movie; in fact it's the exact opposite of what we learned to expect from that category. Calling it a comics flick would also give a very wrong idea of what it is. It's certainly not a comedy, but it's not really a drama either. If you really must know what kind of film is it, think in the direction of 'Daria' but more intelligent, sensitive and with three-dimensional characters (not only physycally). Or, more accurately, three three-dimensional characters making their way in a two-dimensional world of cardboard and plastic.The movie does have some very nice comedic moments, but it's more important traits are its atmosphere and symbolisms. It's beautiful and sensitive and creates a mesmerising atmosphere, Making for a superb adaptation of Daniel Clowes's original graphic novel (though the story itself has little to do with that of the source). The directing (Terry Zwigoff in his first non-documentry) is masterful and very original and unique, the dialogue is sharp and intelligent (quite a lot of it is taken directly from the novel, but the rest is in very much the same spirit), and the actors are all superb; Thora Birch, Scarlett Johansson and Steve Buscemi as the more sophisticated characters make a fantastic job. They are strenghtened by the wonderful, mostly hilerious cartoonish stereotypes that surround them, like Enid's father (Gosford Park's Bob Balaban), the creepy John Ellis (Pat Healy), the pretentious art teacher (Illeana Douglas), and the abnoxious Melorra (Debra Azar). A wonderful movie all around.There is a change, though hardly unnoticed, happenning in the cinema world. More than ten years after the artistic revolution in comics, the graphic novel is finally being appreciated as a potential source for films, starting with the Hughes Brothers' excellent adaptation of Alan Moore's and Eddie Campbell's 'From Hell', soon followed by this adaptation of Daniel Clowes's classic. (With any luck, we might also see in the near future another Moore masterpiece, 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen', brought to the big screen, as well as Frank Miller's groundsbreaking 'Batman - Year One'). Having been lucky enough to be in NY at precisely the time these two movies came out, I was thrilled to see the novels on which they were based in book stores...

It's tough to be a kid in &quot;Ghost World&quot; where your choices are limited to joining the &quot;in-crowd&quot; or, developing a highly refined sense of irony, as does our heroine, Enid. &quot;Ghost World&quot; is a brilliantly conceived film by Zwigoff, the director of the riveting documentary about the life and times of undergound comic artist, R.Crumb. Steve Bushemi plays Seymour, a charmingly eccentric collector of odd cultural artifacts who sometimes appears to be an alter-ego aforementioned Mr. Crumb. Thora Birch's Enid, is a directionless recent high school graduate (sort of) who has lost her bearings in a sea of suburban mediocrity. You will seldom see a more tender and complex relationship portrayed as the relationship between by Bushemi and Birch. They are two doomed outsiders who view the transparency of human relationships with intelligent irony. This is a small movie that should be a runaway success, but never will be. In &quot;Ghost World&quot;, we like big action packed blockbuster movies.  If you've ever questioned the society you live in, this one's for you. I absolutely loved this movie. It has great characters and writing, a distinctive and colorful visual style, and some vicious satire. Plus, the much-loved Steve Buscemi has his greatest role ever.  Every single scene has virtually no obligatory lines, and is both moving and hilariously funny. Thora Birch proves she can carry a movie and Steve Buscemi gives his career best; they're both oscar-worthy.",5,Vinyl Records are our friends!,1082592000,"04 22, 2004",2004,1895,"['Terry', 'Zwigoff', 'quot', 'Ghost', 'World', 'quot', 'anonymous', 'Anytown', 'USA', 'landscaped', 'strip', 'malls', 'drive-up', 'ATM', 'windows', 'expresso', 'bars', 'mini-marts', 'tanning', 'parlors', 'burger', 'franchise', 'corner', 'place', 'where', 'bus', 'no', 'longer', 'mind', 'old', 'man', 'bench', 'quot', 'Ghost', 'World', 'quot', 'where', 'everyone', 'big', 'hair', 'SUV', 'designer', 'clothers', 'tough', 'be', 'kid', 'quot', 'Ghost', 'World', 'quot', 'where', 'choices', 'are', 'limited', 'joining', 'quot', 'in-crowd', 'quot', 'developing', 'highly', 'refined', 'sense', 'irony', 'heroine', 'Enid', 'quot', 'Ghost', 'World', 'quot', 'brilliantly', 'conceived', 'film', 'Zwigoff', 'director', 'riveting', 'documentary', 'life', 'times', 'undergound', 'comic', 'artist', 'R.Crumb', 'Steve', 'Bushemi', 'Seymour', 'charmingly', 'eccentric', 'collector', 'odd', 'cultural', 'artifacts', 'who', 'sometimes', 'be', 'alter-ego', 'aforementioned', 'Mr.', 'Crumb', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'Enid', 'directionless', 'recent', 'high', 'school', 'graduate', 'sort', 'who', 'lost', 'bearings', 'sea', 'suburban', 'mediocrity', 'will', 'seldom', 'see', 'more', 'tender', 'complex', 'relationship', 'portrayed', 'relationship', 'Bushemi', 'Birch', 'are', 'two', 'doomed', 'outsiders', 'who', 'view', 'transparency', 'human', 'relationships', 'intelligent', 'irony', 'small', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'runaway', 'success', 'never', 'will', 'be', 'quot', 'Ghost', 'World', 'quot', 'like', 'big', 'action', 'packed', 'blockbuster', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'questioned', 'society', 'live', 'one', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'movie', 'great', 'characters', 'writing', 'distinctive', 'colorful', 'visual', 'style', 'vicious', 'satire', 'much-loved', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'greatest', 'role', 'ever', 'Every', 'single', 'scene', 'virtually', 'obligatory', 'lines', 'moving', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'can', 'carry', 'movie', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'career', 'best', ""'re"", 'oscar-worthy']",N/A
681355,A1J5TC13BSPA2M,B00005T30L,"James Simpson ""James Simpson""","[1, 1]","In some ways, the film ""Ghost World(2001)"" is brilliant. Few films have captured on such a realistic and intimate level, the plight of so many people both lost and alone. It's a portrait of modern society that really  should be discussed alot more than it is.The plot follows two High School pals(Thora Birch and Scarlet Johansson) and there travels  into adult life and responsibility. The film begins very humorously with the sardonic duo's comments on the plastic people that occupy everyday society, both biting and honest. However, there maturity,and ultimately, purpose is challenged, when one of there pranks goes awry on a lonely record collector played by Steve Buscemi. After this encounter, the duo become more seperate. Johansson begins to mellow out and finds a job and responsibility, while Birch attempts to find her place in the world as everything chnages around her.The acting in ""Ghost World"" is among the best presented this decade. Birch and Johansson are both excellent and it was not surprising to see them gain careers from this picture. They are both funny and exceptionally beautiful young women which sets a basis for one of the film's thesis', particularly in Birch's case. Birch is an exceptionally pretty and very well formed young woman who can't seem to find friends or a date. Men barely notice her and it's based more around her choice of clothing and intellectual side than anything. Birch's subtle signs of loneliness are very real and reflect many young people that i've known. Her seemingly sardonic asides and attitude merely masking her yearning for acceptance and love that she only encounters seldomly. The eventual relationship she has with Buscemi's character is very heartfelt and moving throughout and forms one of the anchors to the picture.Johansson's character is representive of that character that many of us have to become in order to survive in society. While intelligent and looking down ona grea number of society, she ultimately is forced to conform to survive and her needs and interests change as a result. She becomes largely absent from the second half of the picture but her friendship with Birch is important and moving nonetheless. The subtle farewell scene they have at the conclusion is so quietly painful.Buscemi deserved an Oscar for this, his best role. An almost clueless loner who collects records and old paraphenalia, admitting that they act as a replacement for the lack of people within his life. He is a realistic and sympathetic character and always interesting throughout. The actor has made a career out of playing eccentrics and weirdos and while some may classify his character as a ""weirdo"", he's really one of the most normal and human characters i've seen depicted in cinema in quite some time.This is an exceptionally well directed film and thankfully never falls to the excessive fast-paced editing and new age nonsense that distracts from so many modern productions. It's well paced and always is the film entertaining and enthralling.It's unfortunate that the ending is so ambiguous. While, it is understandable what the author's intentions may have been, that of having Birch either drift away from life and dissapear and/or be swallowed up in the shallow recesses of mature monotony, this does not make a fully suitable ending. After two hours with these characters, the final seven minutes of the film are somewhat dissapointing, even if they can be forgiveable.Despite this ending though, ""Ghost World"" still ranks as one of the most intelligent and best acted films of this decade and is highly reccomended for fans of Dark Comedy and Existentionalist Cinema.",4,Meaningful and Moving observation of Alienation and Loneliness,1254182400,"09 29, 2009",2009,3651,"['ways', 'film', 'Ghost', 'World', '2001', 'brilliant', 'Few', 'films', 'have', 'captured', 'realistic', 'intimate', 'level', 'plight', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'lost', 'alone', 'portrait', 'modern', 'society', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'discussed', 'alot', 'more', 'plot', 'two', 'High', 'School', 'pals', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'Scarlet', 'Johansson', 'travels', 'adult', 'life', 'responsibility', 'film', 'very', 'humorously', 'sardonic', 'duo', 'comments', 'plastic', 'people', 'occupy', 'everyday', 'society', 'biting', 'honest', 'However', 'maturity', 'ultimately', 'purpose', 'challenged', 'when', 'one', 'pranks', 'awry', 'lonely', 'record', 'collector', 'played', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'encounter', 'duo', 'become', 'more', 'seperate', 'Johansson', 'mellow', 'out', 'job', 'responsibility', 'Birch', 'attempts', 'find', 'place', 'world', 'everything', 'chnages', 'her.The', 'acting', 'Ghost', 'World', 'best', 'presented', 'decade', 'Birch', 'Johansson', 'are', 'excellent', 'was', 'not', 'surprising', 'see', 'gain', 'careers', 'picture', 'are', 'funny', 'exceptionally', 'beautiful', 'young', 'women', 'basis', 'one', 'film', 'thesis', 'particularly', 'Birch', 'case', 'Birch', 'exceptionally', 'pretty', 'very', 'well', 'formed', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'friends', 'date', 'Men', 'barely', 'based', 'more', 'choice', 'clothing', 'intellectual', 'side', 'anything', 'Birch', 'subtle', 'signs', 'loneliness', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'reflect', 'many', 'young', 'people', 'i', ""'ve"", 'known', 'seemingly', 'sardonic', 'asides', 'attitude', 'merely', 'masking', 'yearning', 'acceptance', 'love', 'only', 'seldomly', 'eventual', 'relationship', 'Buscemi', 'character', 'very', 'heartfelt', 'moving', 'forms', 'one', 'anchors', 'picture.Johansson', 'character', 'representive', 'character', 'many', 'have', 'become', 'order', 'survive', 'society', 'intelligent', 'looking', 'down', 'ona', 'grea', 'number', 'society', 'ultimately', 'forced', 'conform', 'survive', 'needs', 'interests', 'change', 'result', 'largely', 'absent', 'second', 'half', 'picture', 'friendship', 'Birch', 'important', 'moving', 'nonetheless', 'subtle', 'farewell', 'scene', 'have', 'conclusion', 'so', 'quietly', 'painful.Buscemi', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'best', 'role', 'almost', 'clueless', 'loner', 'who', 'records', 'old', 'paraphenalia', 'admitting', 'act', 'replacement', 'lack', 'people', 'life', 'realistic', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'always', 'interesting', 'actor', 'made', 'career', 'playing', 'eccentrics', 'weirdos', 'may', 'classify', 'character', 'weirdo', 'really', 'one', 'most', 'normal', 'human', 'characters', 'i', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'depicted', 'cinema', 'quite', 'time.This', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'directed', 'film', 'thankfully', 'never', 'excessive', 'fast-paced', 'editing', 'new', 'age', 'nonsense', 'so', 'many', 'modern', 'productions', 'well', 'paced', 'always', 'film', 'entertaining', 'enthralling.It', 'unfortunate', 'ending', 'so', 'ambiguous', 'understandable', 'what', 'author', 'intentions', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'having', 'Birch', 'drift', 'away', 'life', 'dissapear', 'and/or', 'be', 'swallowed', 'up', 'shallow', 'recesses', 'mature', 'monotony', 'not', 'make', 'fully', 'suitable', 'ending', 'two', 'hours', 'characters', 'final', 'seven', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'somewhat', 'dissapointing', 'even', 'can', 'be', 'forgiveable.Despite', 'ending', 'Ghost', 'World', 'still', 'one', 'most', 'intelligent', 'best', 'acted', 'films', 'decade', 'highly', 'reccomended', 'fans', 'Dark', 'Comedy', 'Existentionalist', 'Cinema']",N/A

Both have turned out great performances (Ricci has been given more roles though but Birch was perfect in American Beauty)but this by far has to be Thora's best film. She finally gets a good leading role and for once i can actually say a comic to big screen has turned out 100% (the only other comic film near this is the 1989 Batman, which of course in in a totally different world all together). It does amaze me that critics actually enjoyed this little indie film because they are quick to point out minor problems and make them huge deals but while i don't always agree with their picks i do with this one. Ghost World may not be Oscar caliber work but it would've been nice to see it nominated more for the other awards shows but sadly it wasn't. Steve Buschemi turns in another wonderful role (all this guy has to do really is play himself and he comes off weird and it always seems to work)and Scarlett Johansson also turns in a wonderful performance. In a way Birch's charchter Enid reminds me of myself and my views and how i just don't want to change or do anything when my friends they all have done more than me and made efforts to move on but will never truly be happy. Very great movie and i will also agree that the dvd is lacking alot. I've never understood why some films get over the top dvd (even some awful undeserving films do)and then some get nothing at all and makes to actually wonder why they bothered to relase it on dvd in the 1st place. They could've at least threw in some bios, and a longer making of documentary and maybe even some background info on the comic book the movie is based on.

681358,A2B3QTNPR6EFDO,B00005T30L,"Jeffrey Jotz ""You'll know him when you find him""","[1, 2]","On one level, Terry Zwigoff's newest film is a tale of teenage angst and an odd romance.  The film's main character, Enid, has a genuinely dark and skeptical view of humanity and popular culture.  Zwigoff does a marvelous job in showing how Enid stumbles into a romance with Seymour, a nerdy, 40-something record collector, and how she reacts to that relationship.  At times, I saw Enid saying and doing things for no logical reason -- very accurate for an 18-year-old.  The director excels at creating a very realistic portrayal of how a teenager thinks and acts...much better than American Pie (1 or 2)!More importantly, Ghost World is a biting satire on America's cultural ignorance, savaging popular culture left and right - sappy movies, political correctness, record collectors, cliched artwork (and art teachers), and more - you gotta look for it!  My favorite scene in the movie placed Enid and Seymour in a bar where an old blues legend was opening up for this cheesy, Blues Traveler-esque &quot;blues&quot; band that passes itself off as authentic &quot;delta blues.&quot;  The frat boys in attendance pay more attention to the sports game on the TV than the bluesman, and when the headliner takes the stage, they all break out dancing like some lounge show (leaving Seymour aghast).Yeah, the romance angle was nice, but I relished the director's sharp-witted stabs at popular culture.

I was never a big fan of the comic, but it did have it's moments. Unfortunately I feel the same way about the Movie. It was just sort of... there. I was expecting more wit less dryness.The biggest problem I had with the flick was an inability to connect with any of the characters. With the exception of Steve Buscemi's character and the dude who goes nuts in the convenience store, I found all the main characters completely unlikeable. Now, maybe that's the ""point"" and maybe I don't ""get it"" and more power to you if you do, but if I want to sit through two hours watching the misadventures of characters I could care less about I'd buy a Freddy Prinze movie or something.I usually go for this kind of schtick, but I just couldn't get into Ghost World. The main reason I bought it was Terry Zwigoff. I loved Crumb, and even though Ghost World wasn't a documentary, I was hoping it would have at least some of it's charm. While it did have it's shining moments, eventually I just wanted it to end. There were very few laughs and the ones I did muster up were pretty strained.No doubt many of you art-house lovers will be praising this one for years to come. Don't let me stop you.

""Ghost World"" slams you back to being a teenager from the first moment and rarely seems forced or made up.""Ghost World"" focuses on two graduating young ladies (Thora Birch, Scarlett Johansson), and their utter contempt for all of the petty smarminess of High School. Their running commentary is laugh out loud hilarious, and it's as true as it is funny.Birch's character meets a reclusive, nerdy record collector (Steve Buscemi), with whom she strikes up a friendship. This is a great role for Buscemi. Buscemi is often cast as the weird, sarcastic loser. But in ""Ghost World"", Zweigoff clearly saw that Buscemi could break away from that stereotype. Buscemi plays the character with a sensitive touch, and a lesser teenage film would have mocked this character rather than respected it.Illeana Douglas also strikes the perfect note as Birch's summer school art teacher.

On this count, ""Ghost World"" is an almost complete failure. The scene that comes closest to evoking the Daniel Clowes universe  -- the Bollywood musical extravaganza that opens the film  -- is lifted wholesale from someone else's film. There's something very wrong with that.The crucial difference between the comic and the movie is that while the comic is deliberately anti-dramatic, the film strains to generate drama and fails.  The film  jumps the shark mainly through  the enlargement of the role of Seymour, who exists in the original Ghost World as some anonymous loser the gals sharpen their claws on (they intercept a personals ad he's placed in which he's summarized his appearance as -- damn your gift for the pathetic detail, Clowes -- ""bearded windbreaker""). Ordinarily, you can count on Steve Buscemi to make any film in which he appears better than it would have been otherwise.  Here, the attention he steals away from the girls' friendship cuts the heart out of the story, which rightly should be: Enid and Rebecca against the world, then, sadly, not even that.Fatal Mistake Two:  Thora Birch could scarcely be less Enid-like. Her stabs at cool affectlessness are both overplayed and feeble, and Enid would never, ever guffaw at her own jokes. In the comic, Enid is a bundle of insecurities, but still has a convincing way with a put-down. Birch's version couldn't psych out a tub of coleslaw. Worse, this extremely uncharismatic actress has been endowed by the Lord Almighty, or a very ambitious plastic surgeon, with physical attributes that effortlessly upstage her in every shot in which they appear.Scarlett Johansson does a much better job rendering  the  attitude of boredom and disdain that is the lynchpin of the girls' relationship.

681363,AB2U893HHHG74,B00005T30L,John DiBello,"[0, 0]","Just like the movies, comics are an art form. Just like movies, comics run the range from mass-market to high art. Nothing wrong with that; sometimes you're in the mood to see Bruce Willis battle Arnold Schwartzenegger on the screen, or read Batman slugging it out with the Joker. But just as you know there's much more to movies than action films, you should also be aware there's much more to comics than four-color superheroes. There's also a large amount of serious comic book literature out there that doesn't fit that superhero mold. And when the worlds of comics and movie collide, comic fanboys (yes, I'm one) often debate what is the best movie based on a comic book: &quot;Superman: The Movie?&quot; The first &quot;Batman?&quot; &quot;X-Men,&quot; or &quot;Blade?&quot; This discussion now must include a movie that features *no* overpumped steroid heroes in spandex. &quot;Ghost World,&quot; faithfully adapted from the comic by Daniel Clowes, is not merely one of the more faithful adaptations of a comic to a movie, but also is one of the most effective and affecting movies of 2001.A funny, sarcastic, sharp slice-of-life, &quot;Ghost World&quot; follows Enid and Rebecca, two girls just graduated from high school. Not quite slackers, not quite ready for the &quot;real&quot; world, they wander through their summer, planning and putting off their future at the same time. Clowes and Zwigoff have a great ear for dialogue: Enid and Rebecca talk like real teenagers do: with sarcasm peppered with raw language mirroring their contempt *and* fascination with the people and places around them. As a fan of the graphic novel I can say it's a faithful adaptation, preserving events, dialogue, and even characters that look (often uncannily) like their graphic novel counterparts--but it doesn't treat its source material as precious and unchangeable; it expands and redirects the storyline of the comic, making it more linear, more unified and full in its examination of Enid's relationship with lonely, jazz-obsessed self-proclaimed dork Seymour. Seymour is quite possible Steve Buscemi's most effective role yet, in my opinion: weird, uncomfortable, but oddly sympathetic, fleshed out from a one-joke note in the graphic novel into a major character for the movie. It's a role worthy of an Oscar supporting actor nomination, and a clear sign to Hollywood that Buscemi *can* play more than just crazed crooks and hair-trigger criminals.This weekend I also saw the first trailer (a year ahead of the movie) for &quot;Spider-Man.&quot; Aside from a clever teaser concept, this trailer shows off everything wrong with Hollywood's perception of making a movie from a comic book: overdone (and not that convincing) special effects, laughable spandex costumes, ear-splittingly loud soundtrack. After this, though, seeing &quot;Ghost World&quot; restored my faith in the possibility of well-done and touching movies based on a serious comic series.",5,The best comic-to-movie adaptation ever,995846400,"07 23, 2001",2001,2954,"['Just', 'movies', 'comics', 'are', 'art', 'form', 'Just', 'movies', 'comics', 'run', 'range', 'mass-market', 'high', 'art', 'Nothing', 'wrong', 'sometimes', ""'re"", 'mood', 'see', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'battle', 'Arnold', 'Schwartzenegger', 'screen', 'read', 'Batman', 'slugging', 'Joker', 'just', 'know', 'much', 'more', 'movies', 'action', 'films', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'aware', 'much', 'more', 'comics', 'four-color', 'superheroes', 'also', 'large', 'amount', 'serious', 'comic', 'book', 'literature', 'there', ""n't"", 'fit', 'superhero', 'mold', 'when', 'worlds', 'comics', 'movie', 'collide', 'comic', 'fanboys', 'yes', ""'m"", 'one', 'often', 'debate', 'what', 'best', 'movie', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'quot', 'Superman', 'Movie', 'quot', 'first', 'quot', 'Batman', 'quot', 'quot', 'X-Men', 'quot', 'quot', 'Blade', 'quot', 'discussion', 'now', 'must', 'include', 'movie', '*no*', 'overpumped', 'steroid', 'heroes', 'spandex', 'quot', 'Ghost', 'World', 'quot', 'faithfully', 'adapted', 'comic', 'Daniel', 'Clowes', 'not', 'merely', 'one', 'more', 'faithful', 'adaptations', 'comic', 'movie', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'effective', 'affecting', 'movies', '2001.A', 'funny', 'sarcastic', 'sharp', 'slice-of-life', 'quot', 'Ghost', 'World', 'quot', 'Enid', 'Rebecca', 'two', 'girls', 'just', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'Not', 'quite', 'slackers', 'not', 'quite', 'ready', 'quot', 'real', 'quot', 'world', 'wander', 'summer', 'planning', 'putting', 'off', 'future', 'same', 'time', 'Clowes', 'Zwigoff', 'have', 'great', 'ear', 'dialogue', 'Enid', 'Rebecca', 'talk', 'real', 'teenagers', 'do', 'sarcasm', 'peppered', 'raw', 'language', 'mirroring', 'contempt', 'fascination', 'people', 'places', 'fan', 'graphic', 'novel', 'can', 'say', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'preserving', 'events', 'dialogue', 'even', 'characters', 'look', 'often', 'uncannily', 'graphic', 'novel', 'counterparts', ""n't"", 'treat', 'source', 'material', 'precious', 'unchangeable', 'storyline', 'comic', 'making', 'more', 'linear', 'more', 'unified', 'full', 'examination', 'Enid', 'relationship', 'lonely', 'jazz-obsessed', 'self-proclaimed', 'dork', 'Seymour', 'Seymour', 'quite', 'possible', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'most', 'effective', 'role', 'yet', 'opinion', 'weird', 'uncomfortable', 'oddly', 'sympathetic', 'fleshed', 'out', 'one-joke', 'note', 'graphic', 'novel', 'major', 'character', 'movie', 'role', 'worthy', 'Oscar', 'supporting', 'actor', 'nomination', 'clear', 'sign', 'Hollywood', 'Buscemi', '*can*', 'play', 'more', 'just', 'crazed', 'crooks', 'hair-trigger', 'criminals.This', 'weekend', 'also', 'saw', 'first', 'trailer', 'year', 'ahead', 'movie', 'quot', 'Spider-Man.', 'quot', 'Aside', 'clever', 'teaser', 'concept', 'trailer', 'off', 'everything', 'wrong', 'Hollywood', 'perception', 'making', 'movie', 'comic', 'book', 'overdone', 'not', 'convincing', 'special', 'effects', 'laughable', 'spandex', 'costumes', 'ear-splittingly', 'loud', 'soundtrack', 'though', 'seeing', 'quot', 'Ghost', 'World', 'quot', 'restored', 'faith', 'possibility', 'well-done', 'touching', 'movies', 'based', 'serious', 'comic', 'series']",N/A

The fact that I had to watch it twice just to finish it doesn't mean much. I fell asleep the first time. I was tired and the movie was boring. Nix that. Because I was tired, the movie was boring.The second time I was totally alert to this film rife with meaning. Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlet Johannson) have been friends for ten years and have that mental telepathy of friendship of the closest kind. However, their friendship is based on being outsiders and isolated from the slightest connection with others, thus a friendship by default.Cynical and world-weary even as a recent graduate from high school, Enid finally finds a job in a movie theater doling out snacks to wary and unwary moviegoers. Enid does not mince words and if she says, How much chemical sludge do you want on your popcorn?,  you really can't blame the supervisor for firing her.The fact that the two young women are going to get an apartment together means a job is essential. Score a negative for Enid. Rebecca is disappointed. Again Rebecca expresses disapproval of Enid's cynical nature concerning boys. None is any good! The viewer can watch Rebecca's slow, yet discernible twist away from her best friend in this significant summer of growth. Change is inevitable, life is inexorable.The second weak link of summer is Enid's art class which she must pass to keep her diploma. The art teacher is a pseudo-hippy, quarking out artisms, not to impress, but because she is a product of this Ghost World. What has meaning? Art? What kind of art?Two oddities stream out of this segment: the poster Enid submits to make a statement and the art that is real, Enid's notebook of art created because she really is talented.The poster unifies the film in that it is the possession of Seymour (Steve Buscemi), an older version of Enid, disillusioned, unsettled with the world at large, and a citizen in the world of his own making. Seymour is Enid's hero and she unlikely bonds with him mentally and physically.Sleepwalk. The major characters sleepwalk through their lives, until Rebecca wakes up to self in the grand way that recent graduates can do. Enid becomes more entrenched in her self-imposed isolation in this Ghost World. It's not a happy film, but then life does not always offer happiness. Take it the way you find it or change it.

Lots of swearing (supposedly to indicate the offhanded angst of the two main characters (Thora Birch as Enid and Scarlett Johansson as Rebecca) and a story as uneventfully told as any my wife and I have seen in a long time.The plot can be told in a sentence: Two recent high school grads with hopes of moving into an apartment together play a cruel joke on a nerdish record collector (played to perfection by the always outstanding Steve Buscemi), with the ringleader girl (Enid) later feeling sorry for him, (somewhat) falling for him, sleeping with him, ruining his life big time and then leaving town, without telling anyone, for parts unknown.Ho-hum.My wife and I kept waiting for this movie to go somewhere, to reach a higher level of either (a) dialog, (b) wit, (c) social commentary, (d) action, (e) humor, or (f) drama.

And the only ""action"" was Enid completely ruining her much older, sad sack ""boyfriend's"" life even more than before she first met him.Even the usually brilliant Bob Balaban looked hopelessly out of place and somewhat uncomfortable in this movie. His exceptional talents were wasted, as were Scarlett Johansson's.In the end, as Enid drives off in a bus and the screen fades to black, one is left with an awful feeling in the pit of one's stomach. We felt terribly sorry for Steve Buscemi's character. We felt only disgust for Enid. We felt as though Rebecca dodged a bullet by not moving in with her loser friend. And, overall, we felt that this film was a lot like life with all of its twists, turns and tragedies -- too much so to be of value as entertainment. It was like watching a Reality Show. Nothing much really happened from what normally might happen in the course of a few weeks in the lives of these 3-4 people.I know this movie is critically acclaimed. But I can't figure out why.

But life for these two alienated young women is far from easy, even after high school. Finding a place for themselves is going to be a longer, stranger trip than they can imagine.Birch and Johannson have a weird but fascinating symmetry, with their masks of cynicism and hardness and sharp humor to keep the rest of the world at bay. Enid ( Thora Birch) is the real center of this picture, especially as her veneer cracks and her insecurities begin to show. She turns out to be far more alienated and lonely than she seems at first and I was awed by Birch's performance here.When they decide to play a prank on an equally alienated adult, played by Steve Buscemi, Enid and Rebecca begin to spin off from each other. Enid is fascinated by the guy but Rebecca is not. Enid forms a strange relationship with him, one that affects her profoundly and threatens her friendship with Rebecca.Not just another teen flick (in fact, I'd guess the average teen might find it depressing) but more of a coming of age story made for the outsiders in the world.

Draper,"[2, 7]","Enid and her friend are portrayed as outsiders among their peer group, but, oddly enough, they remind me of many other young people I know these days.  They have this dry sort of mockingly cynical attitude with lots of overstatement, (Enid, ""If my dad starts to date _____ again, I'll just have to kill myself""). Also, Scarlotte Johannson's monotone is perfect here. It seems that they are way too cool to be identified with the stupid mainstream of society, so they start their own society.  After a while Enid and Rebecca just appear to be trying to impress each other with how much they hate everything, and therefore how cool they are.  Rather than being marginalized outsiders, they choose to stand outside and marginalize the ""insiders"".However, real issues of disenfranchisement do exist in the film.  Racism is the obvious one.  At the beginning, the two girls are really a unit: they are always together, they think alike, and they answer questions as if they were one person.  But occasionally, someone refers to them as ""Enid the Jew and her Aryan friend, Rebecca.""  In fact, Rebecca does become separate from Enid, and Enid gradually becomes more and more detached from society. But first Enid doesn't graduate from high school. Enid gets fired from her job.(by her own anti-social behavior). Little wonder that Enid identifies with the racist poster from the ""Coon Chicken"" restaurant (a real place, I might add). Ironically, this causes her to flunk summer art, and therefore high school--again--and to loose the promised scholarship to art school, the one place where her quirky thinking might have helped her flourish.

681379,A2T049UQONS0OY,B00005T30L,Larry VanDeSande,"[5, 6]","Here's an unHollyowood film about life, roles, friendship and departure that transcends most of the trash available on the big or little screen. I saw this on TV last night, followed by the big screen spectacular &quot;Three Kings&quot;. It was more than clear to me which film was about ideas and real life, and which one was a cure for insomnia. I'll talk about the one about ideas and real life.Unlike the Amazon synopsis and Leonard Maltin's opinion, this movie is not about alienation. It is about a cynical high school graduate's attempt to find a niche to fit into when her world undergoes changes she cannot understand. Thora Birch (&quot;American Beauty&quot;) is very good as the high school graduate with a dark view of everything in the world...until she meets milquetoast record collector Steve Buscemi. There is a good deal of cliche in this meeting but it serves to break the holocaust of darkness in her life, which is compounded by her best friend changing roles, her schlemiel father being an empty, vacuous figure in her life, and her indecision about what to do with her own life.Birch focuses on loser Buscemi, trying to improve his lot in life. She successfully helps set him up with another woman, then injects herself in his life in a way to locate her own life when everyone she knows seemingly abandons her. When this fails, she follows the pattern of the only other stable role model in her life, a mentally ill middle age man who sits at a bus stop, waiting for a bus that never arrives. When his bus one day arrives, she decides to take it, too, as the movie ends.This is Birch's final removal from the world, the alienation most critics disucssed. I prefer to think of it as role acceptance, as finding her niche, as getting to a place she wants.

If you don't buy it, you'll be renting it sporadically from then on. I never read any of the comics relating to this film and you don't have to. Enid and Rebecca are best friends and total opposites, the only thing they share is their complete apathy toward most of the people they know. Everything in their eyes is overrated and they kill time poking fun at others and humilating them for their mere pleasure and entertainment. It's cruel, yes, but it's quite funny too. Enid secretly is at a breaking point in her life, unsure of who she really is and what she wants from life, she changes hair color, hobbies and jobs as often as she changes her socks. But the real laugh is on Enid when a nasty prank on average guy Seymour, sparks a scandalous attraction and jealousy and acceptance slowly take hold of her. Though the age difference between Seymour and Enid is acknowledged, you never shake your head with disbelief. It's a journey they both need to take in their lives, however unaccepted it may be by society rules. Eventually, Enid and Rebecca grow apart and the story never disappoints in showing us the agonies of real life. This little gem belongs on your shelf of favorites if it finds a place in your heart.

Director Terry Zwigoff also made the documentary Crumb, which was about offbeat cartoonist Robert Crumb and his oddball family. Apparently Zwigoff has a good understanding and sympathy for people living on the cultural fringes. Ghost World is itself based on a comic book, though I am not familiar with it. Ghost World follows the adventures of recent high school graduates Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlet Johansson). Actually, Enid hasn't quite graduated; she must take a summer school course first. Enid is a witty misanthrope who despises the normal people and soulless suburbia that surrounds her. Her acerbic commentaries are a large part of the movie's wit. Enid and Rebecca play a rather sadistic practical joke on an older man named Seymour (played to perfection by Steve Buscemi). Enid soon regrets this and finds that she likes and is attracted to him. Seymour is intelligent and sensitive but something of a social misfit. He collects old records and, like Enid, feels ill at ease in the world. This new friendship creates a wedge between Enid and the basically more conventional Rebecca, who sees Seymour as merely a nerd. Ghost World is a film that relies far more on characterization and social commentary than on plot development. Apart from the nuanced performances by Birch and Buscemi, the film effectively portrays the barrenness of modern suburban America. I don't know where it was filmed, but it could have been, alas, almost anywhere. There are also some very good supporting roles, such as Illeana Douglas as Enid's art teacher. Her role, though secondary, is typical of the of the film's sublety. At first she seems comically naive, flaky and PC, but she ends up being supportive of Enid when a controversy over a racially sensitive art work arises. Similarly, Buscemi's character at first seems like a stereotype nerd, but is gradually fleshed out. Ghost World shows the world from a perspective too seldom seen in modern cinema. Most outsiders in modern movies are hit men, drug dealers or below normal in some way (retarded, autistic, etc.). Enid and Seymour, by contrast, are alienated by their perceptiveness and sensitivity. They are perhaps overly judgmental and reactionary, but they don't simply consume, conform and passively absorb the world around them. They question everything and find much ugliness, stupidity and imperfection. Ghost World has a fairly dim and cynical view of the world, but in many ways it is right on target.",5,"Brilliantly witty, perceptive and acerbic",1058659200,"07 20, 2003",2003,2632,"['Ghost', 'World', 'intelligent', 'original', 'funny', 'look', 'modern', 'life', 'perspective', 'outsiders', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'very', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'Director', 'Terry', 'Zwigoff', 'also', 'made', 'documentary', 'Crumb', 'was', 'offbeat', 'cartoonist', 'Robert', 'Crumb', 'oddball', 'family', 'Apparently', 'Zwigoff', 'good', 'understanding', 'sympathy', 'people', 'living', 'cultural', 'fringes', 'Ghost', 'World', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'am', 'not', 'familiar', 'Ghost', 'World', 'adventures', 'recent', 'high', 'school', 'graduates', 'Enid', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'Rebecca', 'Scarlet', 'Johansson', 'Actually', 'Enid', ""n't"", 'quite', 'graduated', 'must', 'take', 'summer', 'school', 'course', 'first', 'Enid', 'witty', 'misanthrope', 'who', 'normal', 'people', 'soulless', 'suburbia', 'acerbic', 'commentaries', 'are', 'large', 'part', 'movie', 'wit', 'Enid', 'Rebecca', 'play', 'rather', 'sadistic', 'practical', 'joke', 'older', 'man', 'named', 'Seymour', 'played', 'perfection', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Enid', 'soon', 'attracted', 'Seymour', 'intelligent', 'sensitive', 'something', 'social', 'misfit', 'old', 'records', 'Enid', 'feels', 'ill', 'ease', 'world', 'new', 'friendship', 'wedge', 'Enid', 'basically', 'more', 'conventional', 'Rebecca', 'who', 'Seymour', 'merely', 'nerd', 'Ghost', 'World', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'characterization', 'social', 'commentary', 'plot', 'development', 'Apart', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'Birch', 'Buscemi', 'film', 'effectively', 'barrenness', 'modern', 'suburban', 'America', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'was', 'filmed', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'alas', 'almost', 'anywhere', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'supporting', 'roles', 'such', 'Illeana', 'Douglas', 'Enid', 'art', 'teacher', 'role', 'secondary', 'typical', 'film', 'sublety', 'first', 'comically', 'naive', 'flaky', 'PC', 'up', 'being', 'supportive', 'Enid', 'when', 'controversy', 'racially', 'sensitive', 'art', 'work', 'arises', 'Similarly', 'Buscemi', 'character', 'first', 'stereotype', 'nerd', 'gradually', 'fleshed', 'out', 'Ghost', 'World', 'world', 'perspective', 'too', 'seldom', 'seen', 'modern', 'cinema', 'Most', 'outsiders', 'modern', 'movies', 'are', 'hit', 'men', 'drug', 'dealers', 'normal', 'way', 'retarded', 'autistic', 'etc.', 'Enid', 'Seymour', 'contrast', 'are', 'alienated', 'perceptiveness', 'sensitivity', 'are', 'perhaps', 'overly', 'judgmental', 'reactionary', 'do', ""n't"", 'simply', 'consume', 'conform', 'passively', 'absorb', 'world', 'question', 'everything', 'find', 'much', 'ugliness', 'stupidity', 'imperfection', 'Ghost', 'World', 'fairly', 'dim', 'cynical', 'view', 'world', 'many', 'ways', 'right', 'target']",N/A

I wasn't.  It's a good movie, mind you.  Interesting characters who feel very genuine albeit somewhat one dimensional, and an odd tangle relationships.  It also very effectively captures the alienation of smart teens growing up in a world that seems populated by zombies of one kind or another.  So, it's very much worthwhile watching it--maybe more than once.  (I can't help but think of Thora Birch as a smart version of Kelly Osbourne from her dress and mannerisms in this movie.  But that's neither here nor there.)So what's wrong with it?  What keeps it from being great?  In part, it's the almost relentlessly brooding tone that keeps the characters from being fully realized human beings.  Maybe, just maybe, there are people as unreliable, aimless, and alienated all the time--just like Thora Birch's character.  But do we really need a movie about someone who is so malignantly morose?  And no one else in the movie really picks up the slack, showing that intelligent people can be sharp and effective, as well as cynical.

681385,ASU3THM5ZUTUI,B00005T30L,"Mark Lee ""Peacemaker""","[15, 17]","In ""Ghost World"", a critically acclaimed film based on the underground comic book of the same name, Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) are the best of friends.  They have just graduated from high school, and while other students are heading off to college, Enid needs to take a summer art class to officially graduate as Rebecca gets a job. In the meantime, they get their kicks by harassing their fellow townsfolk.  But when they play a mean trick on a dorky middle-aged record collector named Seymour (Steve Buscemi), their lifelong friendship begins to weaken as they drift further and further apart from each other.  Over time, Enid discovers the challenges of becoming an adult in a world where she ""can't identify herself with 99% of humanity"".First and foremost: ""Ghost World"" is not your typical ""teen"" movie.  It is not a scary movie either, in spite of the title.  It is, instead, an extremely difficult film to review.  It is an unusual film in many ways, being both funny and sad.  Nevertheless, I still found myself having a great time with it.  It's a daring little picture with terrific writing and top-notch performances that turn its convoluted plot into something so deceptively easy to enjoy.I personally could not relate to any of the characters portrayed in this film, but their personalities are so well-defined, and the performances convey all their emotions to such remarkable credibility that I wound up caring for their situations anyway.  Enid doesn't actually know who she is or what her talents are, although she's quite certain of what she doesn't want to be.  Throughout the film she goes through different personalities, including costumes and hairstyles, but none of them really work out for her.  Rebecca is a little more up on her feet, with a better idea of who she wants to be.Yet, at the same time, both girls are so deliciously sarcastic and cynical that almost any 5-minute section of the film will make you chuckle.  (The scene where Enid gets a job in a local movie theater is absolutely priceless.)  The script is so sharply written, going perfectly with Enid and Rebecca's spunky teenage spirit, and at the same time it can be quite stirring when it drives home the realities of growing up.Meanwhile, Steve Buscemi creates Seymour, another indelible character who in some scenes curses the world for providing such an awful life for him, and in other scenes simply quiets down and accepts it.  Later on, he and Enid learn a lot from each other, and how some things in life just don't go as planned.But the main reason why ""Ghost World"" is such an intriguing film is because there is so much going on and so many little subtleties being thrown at the viewer in every scene, although the viewer doesn't notice it.  The first time I saw this film, I thought the plot was going nowhere in some scenes, when really it was moving quite fast.  The film's title comes from the concept that the old, familiar world of the nowhere-town in which the film takes place is slowly dying away, as it is being overwhelmed by fake 50's diners and malls.  At the same time, it refers to the tiny little 1% of humanity which Seymour and Enid actually can relate to.  All throughout there are references to both ""ghost worlds"", ranging from Seymour's record collection to Enid's art class.Eventually, the film comes to a curious ending that leaves all the main characters in a new state of mind.  The ending doesn't explain much, but it suggests a variety of feelings, including tragedy in one character's case, and hope in another's.There's so much more to this film than what I can explain in words.  I didn't realize what a brilliant film this was until a few days after I saw it.  At that point, I wanted to see it again to catch all the little details I'd missed.  ""Ghost World"" is a unique little gem, a refreshingly smart and insightful look at the lives of two girls developing into the adults they will eventually be.  It is a quiet little film, and only the most intrepid moviegoers will decide to watch it for themselves.  It will not have the same effect on all its viewers, but anyone who sees it with an open mind should have a pretty good time.  If you see it, see it on DVD; the special featurette on the making of the film may help you understand it better afterwards.(Also, if you see it, stay seated until after the ending credits.)",5,"Brilliant movie; funny, poignant, wise and wonderful!",1041638400,"01 4, 2003",2003,4391,"['Ghost', 'World', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'film', 'based', 'underground', 'comic', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Enid', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'Rebecca', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'have', 'just', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'other', 'students', 'are', 'heading', 'off', 'college', 'Enid', 'take', 'summer', 'art', 'class', 'officially', 'graduate', 'Rebecca', 'job', 'meantime', 'get', 'kicks', 'harassing', 'fellow', 'townsfolk', 'when', 'play', 'mean', 'trick', 'dorky', 'middle-aged', 'record', 'collector', 'named', 'Seymour', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'lifelong', 'friendship', 'weaken', 'drift', 'further', 'further', 'apart', 'other', 'time', 'Enid', 'challenges', 'becoming', 'adult', 'world', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'identify', '99', '%', 'humanity', '.First', 'foremost', 'Ghost', 'World', 'not', 'typical', 'teen', 'movie', 'not', 'scary', 'movie', 'either', 'spite', 'title', 'instead', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'film', 'review', 'unusual', 'film', 'many', 'ways', 'being', 'funny', 'sad', 'Nevertheless', 'still', 'found', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'daring', 'little', 'picture', 'terrific', 'writing', 'top-notch', 'performances', 'turn', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'something', 'so', 'deceptively', 'easy', 'enjoy.I', 'personally', 'could', 'not', 'relate', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'film', 'personalities', 'are', 'so', 'well-defined', 'performances', 'convey', 'emotions', 'such', 'remarkable', 'credibility', 'wound', 'up', 'caring', 'situations', 'anyway', 'Enid', ""n't"", 'actually', 'know', 'who', 'what', 'talents', 'are', 'quite', 'certain', 'what', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'film', 'different', 'personalities', 'including', 'costumes', 'hairstyles', 'none', 'really', 'work', 'out', 'Rebecca', 'little', 'more', 'up', 'feet', 'better', 'idea', 'who', 'be.Yet', 'same', 'time', 'girls', 'are', 'so', 'deliciously', 'sarcastic', 'cynical', 'almost', '5-minute', 'section', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'chuckle', 'scene', 'where', 'Enid', 'job', 'local', 'movie', 'theater', 'absolutely', 'priceless', 'script', 'so', 'sharply', 'written', 'going', 'perfectly', 'Enid', 'Rebecca', 'spunky', 'teenage', 'spirit', 'same', 'time', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'stirring', 'when', 'home', 'realities', 'growing', 'up.Meanwhile', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Seymour', 'indelible', 'character', 'who', 'scenes', 'world', 'providing', 'such', 'awful', 'life', 'other', 'scenes', 'simply', 'quiets', 'down', 'accepts', 'Later', 'Enid', 'learn', 'lot', 'other', 'how', 'things', 'life', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'planned.But', 'main', 'reason', 'why', 'Ghost', 'World', 'intriguing', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'so', 'many', 'little', 'subtleties', 'being', 'thrown', 'viewer', 'scene', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'notice', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'film', 'thought', 'plot', 'was', 'going', 'nowhere', 'scenes', 'when', 'really', 'was', 'moving', 'quite', 'fast', 'film', 'title', 'concept', 'old', 'familiar', 'world', 'nowhere-town', 'film', 'place', 'slowly', 'dying', 'away', 'being', 'overwhelmed', 'fake', '50', 'diners', 'malls', 'same', 'time', 'tiny', 'little', '1', '%', 'humanity', 'Seymour', 'Enid', 'actually', 'can', 'relate', 'are', 'references', 'ghost', 'worlds', 'ranging', 'Seymour', 'record', 'collection', 'Enid', 'art', 'class.Eventually', 'film', 'curious', 'ending', 'main', 'characters', 'new', 'state', 'mind', 'ending', ""n't"", 'explain', 'much', 'variety', 'feelings', 'including', 'tragedy', 'one', 'character', 'case', 'hope', ""another's.There"", 'so', 'much', 'more', 'film', 'what', 'can', 'explain', 'words', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'what', 'brilliant', 'film', 'was', 'few', 'days', 'saw', 'point', 'wanted', 'see', 'again', 'catch', 'little', 'details', ""'d"", 'missed', 'Ghost', 'World', 'unique', 'little', 'gem', 'refreshingly', 'smart', 'insightful', 'look', 'lives', 'two', 'girls', 'developing', 'adults', 'will', 'eventually', 'be', 'quiet', 'little', 'film', 'only', 'most', 'intrepid', 'moviegoers', 'will', 'decide', 'watch', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'effect', 'viewers', 'anyone', 'who', 'open', 'mind', 'should', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'time', 'see', 'see', 'DVD', 'special', 'featurette', 'making', 'film', 'may', 'help', 'understand', 'better', 'afterwards', 'Also', 'see', 'stay', 'seated', 'ending', 'credits']",N/A
681386,A51FZD3M0N4AH,B00005T30L,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[0, 0]","This review replaces the one that seconded criticism of the last two scenes as being out of place and contrary to the narrative flow. That was exactly my sentiment after viewing the film in the theater, when it first came out in 2001. However, recently I saw it again, this time on DVD, and to my greatest amazement discovered the true last scene. It was a short ""cartoonish"" version of Seymour's convenience store fight (but with a different outcome) that popped out after the final credits. I don't know if that scene was a part of the theatrical release, since by the time it should have appeared on the screen I had already left the hall, as most other viewers did, but the scene does bring an unusual twist, resulting in a more effective ending, especially when connected with a momentous expression on the face of Seymour's therapist closing the door behind him and his mother.

Her best friend, Rebecca(Scarlett Johanson), keeps nagging her about moving into an apartment with her.  While playing a prank on a lonely middle-aged man, Seymour (Steve Buscemi), Enid becomes very close to him and learns that he is very interesting.

681388,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005T30L,Matthew Horner,"[8, 9]","Ghost World , a dark comedy about teen angst, serves as an antidote to all those mindless Hollywood teen comedies and/or dramas that sprout up in multiplexes like summer weeds. Be forewarned that this antidote is far stronger than many viewers can tolerate. Consider the tag line that appeared on its theatrical posters: ""Accentuate the Negative""Movies about the alienation that some teenagers feel can be traced back fifty years to the James Dean classic, Rebel Without a Cause. Prior to this film, pathologically unhappy kids were always depicted as residents of slums and orphanages. Suddenly, here was a movie that showed kids growing up lost and miserable in a middle-class environment. The idea that the American Dream had a dark side was controversial then. It still is.In Ghost World, Enid and Rebecca [brilliantly played by Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson] are best friends who are just graduating from high school. They're of the super cool, intelligent group that sees beyond the hype and myths of our consumer driven society. As the movie plainly shows, those who see the world too clearly can end up even more clueless than those who see it through a mental fog can. It points out that belief in false values can be more comforting than belief in no values at all. This, of course, presents one of the great conundrums of life in suburbia.Enid and Rebecca's plans for the summer include getting an apartment together. Rebecca is the more realistic of the two. She gets a job and goes about looking for a place for them to live. Enid is paralyzed from seeing little of meaning in her life. Her assessment of the world around her is accurate, but her attitude starts to cause a rift in her relationship with Rebecca.The girls alleviate their boredom by play mind games with people. When they read a pathetic personal ad in the newspaper, they decide to contact the nerdy-sounding guy who placed it. This turns out to be Seymour [Steve Buscemi], who collects old 78 rpm records, hasn't had a date in years, has forgotten how to carry on a normal [meaning banal] conversation, and has made a lifestyle out of alienation. Enid has found her soul mate, but can two such searching souls ever truly bond with another person?Director Zwigoff, who in real life is not unacquainted with alienation, has made an ingeniously original movie. The subject matter may be dark, but it is never brooding. Humor abounds in nearly every scene, although much of it is the kind that some people don't understand or don't appreciate. Too dry, too scathing, etc.Ghost World is based on a famous underground comic book `novel', which may be why the world it shows often seems to be coming from some alternate reality. The place the girls live in exists in its own time and space. Everything's just a little too bright, a little too strange, a little too off center. I liked this odd point of view. It made the black humor more palatable. This city wasn't like the one I live in. Or was it? I couldn't really solve my problems the way Enid did at the end. Or could I? Is her world science fiction, or is the real fiction the world we have created?Some people will always dismiss the problems that cause teenagers who have been given `everything' to see their lives as lacking in meaning. Ghost World  doesn't provide answers or solutions. It does do its quirky best to show us that there are valid reasons why some people see life's illusions too clearly, both in the movie's world and in the real one. It also says that such people are not necessarily as weak as they appear. They can and do go on to lead useful, productive lives. But first they must find their way out of the mess they were born into.",5,"Full of angst, insight and dark humor.

One of whom people seem to go ga-ga for, and she looks much better without the 20lbs she had to gain for this! I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself laughing along with Seymour (played brilliantly by Steve Buscemi) and identifying (slightly) with Thora Birch's character, Enid. She's the kinda person you could be friends with; she's so fantastic with the dry humour! However, I'll always know Thora Birch as Teeny in Now &amp; Then, and she's still the same, just a little more grown up, but she still does the same facial expressions. At least she doesn't have to put Jell-O filled balloons in her bra anymore!Steve Buscemi did his character, the overly eccentric and dorky Seymour, who Enid almost seems to grow an obsession with, which results in something which is quite embarrassing and cringe-worthy, especially the aftermath. You really do feel sorry for him, especially since he seems to be after Enid more than usual afterwards.You get a whole background to Enid's character - her wimpy father, her dress sense, her bedroom, her taste in music/films. But what was really disappointing was the lack of background information about Rebecca's (Scarlett Johansson) character. She was basically a tag-along, and did all the following of the leader, Enid. Her character could have lots of development to it, but she was pushed aside to overly-extend Enid's character and home-life. Scarlett has definitely changed since Ghost World - she's gone platinum blonde since 'appearing' in films like Girl With A Pearl Earring and Lost In Translation. Rebecca seems to come and go in the film, she doesn't appear that much, and disappears for a lot of the film, along popping up now and then.I really saw similarities between this and Romy &amp; Michele's High School Reunion. And any other high school movies along these lines.At the start, I did not like Enid. She basically bossed Rebecca about, told her what to do and when and then she started on Seymour! Towards the end, I really began to feel for her, and felt a bit sad. This film said it was like no other &quot;teen comedy&quot; which seemed to imply it was a teen 'comedy'. Am I missing something, cos most of the film made me feel really sad, when it came to Enid &amp; Rebecca falling out, or the awkwardness with Enid &amp; Seymour. Sure, Seymour was funny, but with me identifying with Enid, I think you'll find this film a bit sad. If you identify with Rebecca, then you'll find it even sadder!I'm so happy to have seen this movie, and it's a great addition to my collection, don't you think?! I'm still a bit freaked that I identified with Enid that much!

Birch plays Enid with the same notes that she played her role in &quot;American Beauty.&quot; The difference is that in AB she was a supporting player but in this film she is the lead. And a lead role requires variety and shading. By the end of the film Birch's never-ending bank stare is bewildering . On the plus side much of the script is smart and witty. But Don Roos did this sort of thing 100% better in &quot;The Opposite of Sex.&quot; And just imagine what Ricci could have done with the role of Enid.,3,ZOMBIES,996105600,"07 26, 2001",2001,816,"['really', 'wanted', 'like', 'Terry', 'Zwigoff', 'quot', 'Ghost', 'World.', 'quot', 'much', 'appreciate', 'performance', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'unfortunately', 'much', 'dislike', 'especially', 'zombie-like', 'performance', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'who', 'was', 'asked', 'play', 'role', 'Enid', 'Chritina', 'Ricci', 'turned', 'down', 'Birch', 'Enid', 'same', 'notes', 'played', 'role', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty.', 'quot', 'difference', 'AB', 'was', 'supporting', 'player', 'film', 'lead', 'lead', 'role', 'variety', 'shading', 'end', 'film', 'Birch', 'never-ending', 'bank', 'stare', 'bewildering', 'plus', 'side', 'much', 'script', 'smart', 'witty', 'Don', 'Roos', 'did', 'sort', 'thing', '100', '%', 'better', 'quot', 'Opposite', 'Sex.', 'quot', 'just', 'imagine', 'what', 'Ricci', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'role', 'Enid']",N/A
681397,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B00005T30L,Michael Crane,"[20, 24]","From a first glance, &quot;Ghost World&quot; appears to be your ordinary teen comedy/drama when in reality nothing could be further from the truth.  This is a strange and very well made film that is touching, funny, sad and twisted.  One of those rare gems that did not fall victim to a &quot;Hollywood&quot; formula.  I don't know why it took me so long to finally watch this, but I'm glad that on a day when I had nothing to do that I decided to pop this into the DVD player.Based on the underground comic book by Daniel Clowes, the story focuses on two characters who have just graduated from high school, Enid and Rebecca.  They love to snoop around in other people's lives and find ways to humiliate them for their own amusement.  When they play a practical joke on an isolating loner, Seymour, Enid can't help to feel a little guilty--which is something she never feels in similar situations.  She ends up forming a strange and open relationship with him after that, and that's when things become complicated for Enid.  While Rebecca has more of a focus on where to go next after finishing high school, Enid doesn't have a clue about her future.  She feels trapped in a dead end town that offers no sanctuary for her.  All of this makes way for a drama/comedy that sticks out from other films.I had been told many times that this was a movie that I had to see, and now I finally understand why.  It was completely different from what I thought the movie would end up being.  It's funny and sad at the same time, which is a very difficult task to accomplish without it ending up being corny.  The movie is very well written (co-written by the very man who did the comic book), with very realistic dialogue and characters.  The movie doesn't really feel like a movie, because it feels like real life.  You feel like you know these characters and have seen them before.  We all went to school with people like this at some point.  That's when you know when something really works--when you feel like you are there.One of the great things about the movie is that there is not a big payoff in the end.  There's on grand finale or an ending that lets you know that everything is going to be all right.  I know this was a disappointment for some people, but I couldn't envision the film ending in any other way.  It's a realistic and beautiful moment.  And to me, that was the greatest payoff you could find.  It also shows you that this film refuses to conform to Hollywood standards, which is always refreshing.The DVD has a few things to offer--&quot;few&quot; being the keyword here.  Don't get me wrong, I was happy with the features that were included, but I was hoping there'd be a few more goodies for a standout movie like this.  The picture and sound is very good, so no problems there.  Extras included are deleted and alternate scenes, a &quot;making of&quot; featurette, trailers and a music video.  I think a great opportunity was missed here, as this is the perfect movie that screams for a commentary from the cast and crew.  Despite the fact that it isn't loaded with a ton of extras, it's still a very nice package.&quot;Ghost World&quot; is a phenomenal achievement in filmmaking, in my opinion.  True, it is not something that everybody will be head-over-heels for, but those who end up loving it will really appreciate it for what it is.  It's a film that takes risks and never falls into a basic movie formula.  If you're looking for a movie that is different from the rest, this is an excellent choice.  A superb film on all fronts. -Michael Crane",5,&quot;I can't relate to 99% of humanity...&quot;,1086566400,"06 7, 2004",2004,3569,"['first', 'glance', 'quot', 'Ghost', 'World', 'quot', 'be', 'ordinary', 'teen', 'comedy/drama', 'when', 'reality', 'nothing', 'could', 'be', 'further', 'truth', 'strange', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'touching', 'funny', 'sad', 'twisted', 'One', 'rare', 'gems', 'did', 'not', 'fall', 'victim', 'quot', 'Hollywood', 'quot', 'formula', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'finally', 'watch', ""'m"", 'glad', 'day', 'when', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'decided', 'pop', 'DVD', 'player.Based', 'underground', 'comic', 'book', 'Daniel', 'Clowes', 'story', 'two', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'just', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'Enid', 'Rebecca', 'love', 'snoop', 'around', 'other', 'people', 'lives', 'find', 'ways', 'humiliate', 'own', 'amusement', 'When', 'play', 'practical', 'joke', 'isolating', 'loner', 'Seymour', 'Enid', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'little', 'guilty', 'something', 'never', 'feels', 'similar', 'situations', 'up', 'forming', 'strange', 'open', 'relationship', 'when', 'things', 'become', 'complicated', 'Enid', 'Rebecca', 'more', 'focus', 'where', 'go', 'next', 'finishing', 'high', 'school', 'Enid', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'future', 'trapped', 'dead', 'end', 'town', 'sanctuary', 'way', 'drama/comedy', 'out', 'other', 'films.I', 'had', 'been', 'told', 'many', 'times', 'was', 'movie', 'had', 'see', 'now', 'finally', 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'completely', 'different', 'what', 'thought', 'movie', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'funny', 'sad', 'same', 'time', 'very', 'difficult', 'task', 'accomplish', 'ending', 'up', 'being', 'corny', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'co-written', 'very', 'man', 'who', 'did', 'comic', 'book', 'very', 'realistic', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'movie', 'real', 'life', 'feel', 'know', 'characters', 'have', 'seen', 'before', 'went', 'school', 'people', 'point', 'when', 'know', 'when', 'something', 'really', 'when', 'feel', 'are', 'there.One', 'great', 'things', 'movie', 'not', 'big', 'payoff', 'end', 'grand', 'finale', 'ending', 'know', 'everything', 'going', 'be', 'right', 'know', 'was', 'disappointment', 'people', 'could', ""n't"", 'envision', 'film', 'ending', 'other', 'way', 'realistic', 'beautiful', 'moment', 'was', 'greatest', 'payoff', 'could', 'find', 'also', 'film', 'conform', 'Hollywood', 'standards', 'always', 'refreshing.The', 'DVD', 'few', 'things', 'offer', 'quot', 'few', 'quot', 'being', 'keyword', 'here', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'was', 'happy', 'features', 'were', 'included', 'was', 'hoping', 'there', ""'d"", 'be', 'few', 'more', 'goodies', 'standout', 'movie', 'picture', 'sound', 'very', 'good', 'problems', 'there', 'Extras', 'included', 'are', 'deleted', 'alternate', 'scenes', 'quot', 'making', 'quot', 'featurette', 'trailers', 'music', 'video', 'think', 'great', 'opportunity', 'was', 'missed', 'here', 'perfect', 'movie', 'commentary', 'cast', 'crew', 'fact', ""n't"", 'loaded', 'ton', 'extras', 'still', 'very', 'nice', 'package.', 'quot', 'Ghost', 'World', 'quot', 'phenomenal', 'achievement', 'filmmaking', 'opinion', 'True', 'not', 'something', 'everybody', 'will', 'be', 'head-over-heels', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'loving', 'will', 'really', 'appreciate', 'what', 'film', 'risks', 'never', 'basic', 'movie', 'formula', ""'re"", 'looking', 'movie', 'different', 'rest', 'excellent', 'choice', 'superb', 'film', 'fronts', '-Michael', 'Crane']",N/A

Mazza,"[23, 25]","Probably the best praise I can offer for ""Ghost World,"" directed by Terry Zwigoff, is that the film had me laughing heartily from the start nearly to the end. Yes, it's a great comedy. But it's also a surprisingly melancholy and touching character study that is graced with superb performances by an excellent cast.""Ghost World"" tells the story of Enid (played by Thora Birch) and her best friend Rebecca (Scarlett Johannson), recent high school grads who are struggling through this transitional phase in their lives. Early in the film the girls, who scorn much of ""mainstream"" society, play a cruel joke on an eccentric loner named Seymour (Steve Buscemi). But what begins as a joke leads into a quirky, engaging relationship between Seymour and Enid. The main story is well complemented by some equally quirky subplots, all of which blend together to form an effective larger story.""Ghost World"" is filled with witty, funny, irony-laden dialogue. And these great words are delivered with flair by the wonderful cast. Birch really shines as an offbeat leading lady; her performance has bite, but she's also appealing and vulnerable. Johannson complements her well as pal Rebecca, and Ileana Douglas is a lot of fun as Enid's politically conscious summer school art teacher. And I can't say enough good things about Steve Buscemi as Seymour. He takes what could have been a stereotypical antisocial loser and instead brings real depth and humanity to the character.The great script and performances are well enhanced by thoughtful, inventive production details; ""Ghost World"" is almost as much fun to look at as it is to listen to.

She can sniff out counterfeit people everywhere and feels she is navigating through a suburbia of ghosts, waifs, mountebanks, charlatans, and philistines. Languishing through her loneliness, she finds solace in her art, her drawings, her journal, and her cynical soulmate Rebecca (Scarlet Johansson). But after graduation, Rebececca's hard edges soften as she tries to adapt to the business world and she shows her yuppie aspirations. This causes a rift between Enid and Rebecca so that now Enid, living with her effete father who is dating an irritating old flame, suffers even greater loneliness. In her desperate state, she meets an incurably geekish social misfit, twenty years her senior, Seymour (Steve Buscemi), who, unlike everyone else she must endure in this suburb town, resonates a certain innocence and authenticity. A reflection of her, Enid is compelled to bond with him, at first as his &quot;mother,&quot; finding him a girlfriend, and then as his lover, but on both counts the relationship is strained and collapses under the weight of Enid's compulsive desperation.By showing Enid, the cynic, lose her mask and become more and more vulnerable through her love for Seymour, the movie creates a wonderful portrait of an adolescent dealing with the existential crises that any sensitive, intelligent young person must face living in a society that extols consumerism and phoniness and has forgotten what authenticity is.

I had absolutely no idea what the movie was about, apart from that it was a comedy, so what I got was a pleasant surprise when much of the comedy here is not only biting but tinged with loneliness and despair.  The film follows two girls, Enid (Birch) and her best friend Scarlett Johannson, as they graduate from high school and slum it through the summer vacation.  Playing pranks on the boring people of the Nowheresville where they live Enid suddenly finds herself attracted to an older man (Buscemi) who collects records obsessively.  Gradually she finds herself leaving her best friend behind for this older man and discovering that slumming it isn't a possibility for the rest of your life.It's difficult to sum up exactly what the movie is about other than to say that it's basically about life, love, hope, despair and tragedy.  However, the caustic comedy lends this an edge that few other films have, not to mention a sometimes overwhelming honesty that is often incredibly moving.  Despite being billed as a comedy (and, indeed, it is very funny at times - in particular in its comments about modern art) this is really more of a drama with comedy in it.  The performances are all top notch, and Thora Birch really sets herself up as the next big thing with a beautifully understated performance that is well matched by the likes of Johannson, Buscemi and the fantastic Illeana Douglas, in a small but instantly recognisable role.The thing with this kind of movie is that it's intelligent, and certainly doesn't belong to the 'American Pie' ilk of teen movies, but in fact is a much more mature little flick that is destined to become a cult classic given enough time.  Sure there are parts of it that are slow, but the emotional weight of the movie is undeniably, with an ending that is either hopeful or tragic given your point of view.  It only really hits you a few days later how good this film really is, and speaking as someone who watched it during the summer vacation before I went to university, it sums up perfectly the fears, dreams and hopes that becoming an adult entails.",5,So I'm bailing this town...,1033689600,"10 4, 2002",2002,2205,"['watched', 'movie', 'only', 'was', 'released', 'video', 'brother', 'recommended', 'so', 'highly', 'had', 'absolutely', 'idea', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'apart', 'was', 'comedy', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'when', 'much', 'comedy', 'here', 'not', 'only', 'biting', 'tinged', 'loneliness', 'despair', 'film', 'two', 'girls', 'Enid', 'Birch', 'best', 'friend', 'Scarlett', 'Johannson', 'graduate', 'high', 'school', 'slum', 'summer', 'vacation', 'Playing', 'pranks', 'boring', 'people', 'Nowheresville', 'where', 'live', 'Enid', 'suddenly', 'attracted', 'older', 'man', 'Buscemi', 'who', 'records', 'obsessively', 'Gradually', 'leaving', 'best', 'friend', 'behind', 'older', 'man', 'discovering', 'slumming', ""n't"", 'possibility', 'rest', 'life.It', 'difficult', 'sum', 'up', 'exactly', 'what', 'movie', 'other', 'say', 'basically', 'life', 'love', 'hope', 'despair', 'tragedy', 'However', 'caustic', 'comedy', 'edge', 'few', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'not', 'mention', 'sometimes', 'overwhelming', 'honesty', 'often', 'incredibly', 'moving', 'being', 'billed', 'comedy', 'indeed', 'very', 'funny', 'times', 'particular', 'comments', 'modern', 'art', 'really', 'more', 'drama', 'comedy', 'performances', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'really', 'up', 'next', 'big', 'thing', 'beautifully', 'understated', 'performance', 'well', 'matched', 'likes', 'Johannson', 'Buscemi', 'fantastic', 'Illeana', 'Douglas', 'small', 'instantly', 'recognisable', 'role.The', 'thing', 'kind', 'movie', 'intelligent', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'belong', ""'American"", 'Pie', 'ilk', 'teen', 'movies', 'fact', 'much', 'more', 'mature', 'little', 'flick', 'destined', 'become', 'cult', 'classic', 'given', 'enough', 'time', 'Sure', 'are', 'parts', 'are', 'slow', 'emotional', 'weight', 'movie', 'undeniably', 'ending', 'hopeful', 'tragic', 'given', 'point', 'view', 'only', 'really', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'how', 'good', 'film', 'really', 'speaking', 'someone', 'who', 'watched', 'summer', 'vacation', 'went', 'university', 'sums', 'up', 'perfectly', 'fears', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'adult', 'entails']",N/A
681404,A2ZA3LSJZD9UO0,B00005T30L,Mr G Bowden,"[3, 3]","""Ghost World"" ranks as the best reviewed film that is based on the old Hollywood debacle, the comic book. However, Daniel Clowes' original ""Ghost World"" graphic novel is rated as one of the best stand alone 'funnybooks' ever, perfectly capturing the malaise and melancholy inherent in all teenagers via his two protagonists, Enid and Rebecca. Terry Zwigoff, with the help of a script co-written by Clowes and himself, perfectly captures this said tone, by delivering a movie that has almost everything a good movie does; by turns funny and sad, uplifting and tragic, this ranks as one of the better films of 2001 easily.The reason ""Ghost World"" didn't break out as well as it should have done at the cinemas (God knows it is a hell of a lot sharper, wittier and funnier than the likes of ""American Pie 2"") was probably due to its misleadingly cheery ad campaign (which peculiarly gives Brad Renfro's extended cameo third billing) and its prominent display of beautiful teen stars Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson on the poster. Whilst Birch admittedly looks a lot worse than when she burst back onto the scene in ""American Beauty"", ""Ghost World"" isn't a teen movie in the sense that ""She's All That"" is a teen movie. 1) It is a hell of a lot more true to life than Hollywood would like to put money into a movie for, with an ambiguous, sarcastic tone inherent with movies like ""Fight Club"" though it admirably doesn't spend $70 million getting its point across; 2) its characters aren't clear-cut, black-and-white good guys and bad guys, but stupid, deluded creatures trying to sift their way through life like the rest of us; 3) it isn't exactly a hip, contemporary movie, its score taking a leaf out of Carter Burwell's score for ""Being John Malkovich"" and having its teenage heroine listen to Bollywood and old-time blues tunes.All of that said, now the audience knows what they are going in for, they can appreciate ""Ghost World"" for what it is; a film so evilly funny and critical of popular culture it hurts and a moving character study of several people, who can be seen as 'ghosts', trying to get a sense of direction in their lives. Birch's Enid is given the most screentime, dying her hair and wearing varied colour-coded outfits to try and gain a cohesive identity of herself as her friends begin to move away from her to supposedly bigger things; and being given this meaty role, she greatly devours it. Equally affecting, however, are Johansson and Steve Buscemi as her equally distant friends; Johansson's moving performance takes a couple of viewings to sink in whilst Buscemi's loser who's life is suddenly ignited by Enid is a performance of acute subtlety; an Oscar nomination please! All the while, the melancholy is undercut with these three characters making fun of the hypocrisy, whitewashing and everything else society does in the name of commerce and pleasure. You start off not feeling for these guys but, come journey's end, they'll stay with you always.""Ghost World"", fundamentally, is a love-it-hate-it film, with little flourishes that everyone in the audience will laugh at (bar Illeana Douglas' hilarious turn as Enid's summer school art tutor); some will get the humour, others will just get bored very easily. But a second look at the movie brings to the fore its merits both as a sly comic deconstruction of consumer society, and a telling document of the fears and expectations, or lack thereof, that are crystallised within all people afraid of becoming as 'ghostly' as the freaks around them.

Since I am a huge Steve Buscemi fan I agreed. I crossed my fingers hoping that this was not going to be your ususal teenager coming of age film and in that respect it most certainly was not.Initially, I was very intrigued by the main caharacter Enid (Thora Birch) who is a typical jaded, cynical teenager who's only motivation is to get the hell out of high school and get on with her life. The only problem is, what to do exactly. Enid is a complicated character who is on the outside of typical high-school society wearing thrift-shop clothing, sketching in her journal and has a penchant for East Indian 60's flims with rock music dance scenes (much like what you find on cable in the wee hours of Sunday mornings). She and her friend constantly observe stranger's foibles and often poke fun at them, even at the expense of the other persons feelings.

681407,A2X9QECJ5W6DOK,B00005T30L,Natalie W,"[0, 5]","So, I read the graphic novel as part of a Comics & Graphic Novels class about three springs ago, and while I didn't really care for the novel that much, I downright *despised* its film counterpart with a fiery passion. They took two young women, who, in my opinion were already shallow and annoying in the novel and multiplied it tenfold in the film. I have no problem with characters that start out snotty and gradually have an epiphany over the course of the film, but it has to be done the ""right"" way. That is: slowly build up to the moment where the girls realize that they have to go their separate ways. Instead, it felt like the first 45 minutes of the film focused solely on the the girls' snarky attitudes rather than trying to flesh out and real character-driven material.That is the one thing I did appreciate about the graphic novel is that you can see the humanity and the flaws that both girls--especially Enid have. In the film, it felt like those specific scenes at the park just came way too fast. I know you can only cut so much into a movie, but that's one scene that could've been expanded upon.Finally, the thing that most disturbed me were the scenes where Enid was ""hanging out"" with Steve Buscemi. Maybe it's because I've always found Buscemi to be really odd or maybe it was the fact that this 18-year-old girl would want a relationship with a 40-something guy creeped me out.Both the graphic novel and the movie play to a certain audience. Some will like it, others will hate it and still others will feel indifferent, but personally neither medium played to my interest as I could never get ""into"" either one.",2,"Not For Me at All.

681408,A1WJ59N7LLU1K3,B00005T30L,Natasha,"[1, 1]","This film is beautifully and uniquely crafted. From the deliciously colorful costumes and set designs, to the quirky, perfectly developed script, to the bordering on brilliant acting- ILOVETHISMOVIE. This is one of those rare films, that feels more like a relevation than anything else. It may take a while to get to you, but once it does, I swear it is one of those films that will never leave your heart+head+soul. I'm not gonna give you a depiction of the plot, because I hate doing that, and plus, I think you can get from other reviews a plots analysis. The thing that might get people turned off from this movie is the one simple fact that in this movie, practically nothing happens. That's right-you get no soft core love scenes, million dollar action thrills and special effects, overblown love stories/affairs.You just get a glimpse into the life of a couple of people living in a small, suburban town. That's it. They meet, they talk, they cry, they listen to music and visit bars. They have fights, and they feel lonely.If you can't stand watching a movie as real as that, then I suggest you stay away from Ghost World.With this movie, I think the director was trying  to show how not a lot has to happen to make people feel deeply. To show how everyday life can be so monotonous and blank,so scary and not worth living.It's not a depressing or boring movie, it's just a movie that depicts life. It's a movie about trying to find, if only just another human soul that you can connect with.The musical score is amazing, especially the theme song which adds such a sad, fragile feel to the movie's cynical surface.Scarlett Johansson is a great sidekick and deserved some more exposure in the film. Everything from her expressions and body language, to the timbre and inflections in her voice makes her captivating to watch. Thora Birch is  good as the heroine. There really is little sympathy expressed for her in this movie, and yet, inexplicably, you still find yourself feeling sorry for her.But Steve Buscemi, hands down, steals the show. The man is a genius, and his acting had me in shreds by the film's end.This movie is also funny. Not in the roll over, laugh out loud kind of way that you would later share with your friends at lunch. More in the subtle, dry, witty kind of way that would make you smile coyly while watching the movie.In conclusion, this movie isn't for everyone. I wish I could say it was, since it's so darn good in my view, but it's not. I can only imagine how many viewers would call it shallow, or monotonous. However, if you like sensitive films with a sad, melancholy undertone, and some dry wit thrown in, check out Ghost World. You could hate, or you could fall in absolute love with, as I have. In fact, it's one of the best films I've seen in recent memory.And, believe whatever you want to believe but Ghost World is in no way a teen movie. I doubt most adults would be able to feel it out.",5,"A sensitive,intricate film",1067644800,"11 1, 2003",2003,2937,"['film', 'beautifully', 'uniquely', 'crafted', 'deliciously', 'colorful', 'costumes', 'set', 'designs', 'quirky', 'perfectly', 'developed', 'script', 'bordering', 'brilliant', 'acting-', 'ILOVETHISMOVIE', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'more', 'relevation', 'anything', 'else', 'may', 'take', 'while', 'get', 'once', 'swear', 'one', 'films', 'will', 'never', 'leave', 'heart+head+soul', ""'m"", 'not', 'gon', 'give', 'depiction', 'plot', 'hate', 'doing', 'think', 'can', 'get', 'other', 'reviews', 'plots', 'analysis', 'thing', 'might', 'get', 'people', 'turned', 'off', 'movie', 'one', 'simple', 'fact', 'movie', 'practically', 'nothing', 'happens', 'right-you', 'get', 'soft', 'core', 'love', 'scenes', 'million', 'dollar', 'action', 'thrills', 'special', 'effects', 'overblown', 'love', 'stories/affairs.You', 'just', 'get', 'glimpse', 'life', 'couple', 'people', 'living', 'small', 'suburban', 'town', 'meet', 'talk', 'cry', 'listen', 'music', 'visit', 'bars', 'have', 'fights', 'feel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'watching', 'movie', 'as', 'real', 'then', 'suggest', 'stay', 'away', 'Ghost', 'World.With', 'movie', 'think', 'director', 'was', 'trying', 'show', 'how', 'not', 'lot', 'happen', 'make', 'people', 'feel', 'deeply', 'show', 'how', 'everyday', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'monotonous', 'blank', 'so', 'scary', 'not', 'worth', 'living.It', 'not', 'depressing', 'boring', 'movie', 'just', 'movie', 'life', 'movie', 'trying', 'find', 'only', 'just', 'human', 'soul', 'can', 'connect', 'with.The', 'musical', 'score', 'amazing', 'especially', 'theme', 'song', 'sad', 'fragile', 'feel', 'movie', 'cynical', 'surface.Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'great', 'sidekick', 'deserved', 'more', 'exposure', 'film', 'Everything', 'expressions', 'body', 'language', 'timbre', 'inflections', 'voice', 'captivating', 'watch', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'good', 'heroine', 'really', 'little', 'sympathy', 'expressed', 'movie', 'yet', 'inexplicably', 'still', 'find', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'her.But', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'down', 'show', 'man', 'genius', 'acting', 'had', 'shreds', 'film', 'end.This', 'movie', 'also', 'funny', 'Not', 'roll', 'loud', 'kind', 'way', 'would', 'later', 'share', 'friends', 'lunch', 'More', 'subtle', 'dry', 'witty', 'kind', 'way', 'would', 'make', 'smile', 'coyly', 'watching', 'movie.In', 'conclusion', 'movie', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'was', 'so', 'darn', 'good', 'view', 'not', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'how', 'many', 'viewers', 'would', 'call', 'shallow', 'monotonous', 'However', 'like', 'sensitive', 'films', 'sad', 'melancholy', 'undertone', 'dry', 'wit', 'thrown', 'check', 'out', 'Ghost', 'World', 'could', 'hate', 'could', 'fall', 'absolute', 'love', 'have', 'fact', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'memory.And', 'believe', 'want', 'believe', 'Ghost', 'World', 'way', 'teen', 'movie', 'doubt', 'most', 'adults', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'feel', 'out']",N/A

Buying it on dvd shortly thereafter, I've been in love with it ever since. This and Bob Brozman'sLive in Germany(a concert dvd I know Seymour would love) are the dvds I've seen more than any others I own.This is one of my favorite American movies of my lifetime. I think it has a huge amount of depth... truth. It's a movie that stars 2 teens (or maybe early 20s at the time but their characters are teens) and a 40-something, but it's not a ""teen movie"" at all. I wish this is how ""teen movies"" are made. I think the USA could be a better place, were that the case. Instead, teen movies feature the dumb pop-tarts du jour and you're sure to see 1 of them walk or run into at least one glass door/wall during the commercial, tee-hee!! (puke!)!There are a million reasons and shadings of reason why I may or may not love, like or feel indifferent towards any given movie. The reasons for my love of Ghost World are simple... I relate in the most serious ways. Enid and Seymour are me split into both genders. Not in superficial ways... I don't dress like either one of them, I've never gotten the geeky/nerd/dork tag as has Seymour, but in the deeper aspects of the movie. There's no other movie I've seen where I feel like they took major parts of me and created 2 believable, heavy characters.Thora is brilliant here. Half the movie is about her eyes, what she says with them and when she says it. Watch her eyes when her and Rebecca talk of never seeing Dennis again. If you've never felt Enid's internal struggle of feeling somehow ""alone"" even around those with whom you are closest, then you're probably Melora. Then there's her first Skip James moment. I think that's how everyone feels their first time with him.With Enid (Thora), I relate internally. With Seymour, I relate more with his interests and what he comes right out and says.This is one of the ultimate ""repeated viewings"" movies. I bought the dvd before I'd seen the movie 3 times. I've seen it at least 35 times since buying it, and have never less than loved it. Some people seem to think it's quirky and entertaining but for me it has gotten deeper with every viewing. Some of the lines... some of the scenes... some of the looks... in its own way, it's a perfect movie.",5,"""$&*(#%^&^ monster""",1196294400,"11 29, 2007",2007,2343,"['finally', 'saw', 'Ghost', 'World', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'things', ""'ve"", 'done', 'myself', 'Buying', 'dvd', 'shortly', 'thereafter', ""'ve"", 'been', 'love', 'ever', 'Bob', ""Brozman'sLive"", 'Germany', 'concert', 'dvd', 'know', 'Seymour', 'would', 'love', 'are', 'dvds', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'more', 'others', 'own.This', 'one', 'favorite', 'American', 'movies', 'lifetime', 'think', 'huge', 'amount', 'depth', 'truth', 'movie', '2', 'teens', 'maybe', 'early', '20s', 'time', 'characters', 'are', 'teens', '40-something', 'not', 'teen', 'movie', 'wish', 'how', 'teen', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'think', 'USA', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'place', 'were', 'case', 'Instead', 'teen', 'movies', 'feature', 'dumb', 'pop-tarts', 'du', 'jour', ""'re"", 'sure', 'see', '1', 'walk', 'run', 'least', 'one', 'glass', 'door/wall', 'commercial', 'tee-hee', 'puke', 'are', 'million', 'reasons', 'shadings', 'reason', 'why', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'love', 'feel', 'indifferent', 'towards', 'given', 'movie', 'reasons', 'love', 'Ghost', 'World', 'are', 'simple', 'relate', 'most', 'serious', 'ways', 'Enid', 'Seymour', 'are', 'split', 'genders', 'Not', 'superficial', 'ways', 'do', ""n't"", 'dress', 'one', ""'ve"", 'never', 'gotten', 'geeky/nerd/dork', 'tag', 'Seymour', 'deeper', 'aspects', 'movie', 'other', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'where', 'feel', 'took', 'major', 'parts', 'created', '2', 'believable', 'heavy', 'characters.Thora', 'brilliant', 'here', 'movie', 'eyes', 'what', 'when', 'Watch', 'eyes', 'when', 'Rebecca', 'talk', 'never', 'seeing', 'Dennis', 'again', ""'ve"", 'never', 'felt', 'Enid', 'internal', 'struggle', 'feeling', 'somehow', 'alone', 'even', 'whom', 'are', 'closest', 'then', ""'re"", 'probably', 'Melora', 'Then', 'first', 'Skip', 'James', 'moment', 'think', 'how', 'everyone', 'first', 'time', 'him.With', 'Enid', 'Thora', 'relate', 'internally', 'Seymour', 'relate', 'more', 'interests', 'what', 'right', 'says.This', 'one', 'ultimate', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'movies', 'bought', 'dvd', ""'d"", 'seen', 'movie', '3', 'times', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'least', '35', 'times', 'buying', 'have', 'never', 'less', 'loved', 'people', 'seem', 'think', 'quirky', 'entertaining', 'gotten', 'deeper', 'viewing', 'lines', 'scenes', 'looks', 'own', 'way', 'perfect', 'movie']",N/A
681417,AWOROFNE3S4W3,B00005T30L,Phillip Frangules,"[2, 7]","I loved the original Daniel Clowes graphic novel. I found the story engaging and the characters really interesting. I had read this after the movie came out, so I waited until it came out on TV.Mind you, I'm not exactly a 'purist' in that every detail needs to be exactly copiied from the book. As long it more or less stays faithful to the general plot and characters I'm satisfied.Ghost World takes a completely different take than the book. Whereas the book focused on Enid and Rebecca's relationship, the film more or less spends more time with a character exclusive to the film named Seymour, a nerdy records collector.After a while it seems like Steven Buscemi's character becomes the protagonist of the film. He came across as more pathetic than sympathetic. There were times when I cringed for him, but overall I found the scenes with him to be boring. The fact that he soon becomes smitten with a girl who just graduated high school just seems downright creepy. (Although Enid becomes attracted to him as well for some reason) At times it feels somewhat like 'One flew over the cuckoo's nest'. Chief Bromden may narrate the book, but the story centers around McMurphy more than anyone else.There are still some elements from the book, but they are more or less there just to be there. Enid's 'friend' who's interested in serial killers and the occult pops in for one or two scenes and is forgotten. His only reason for being there is well...because he was in the book. The love triangle subplot, one of the bigger parts about the book, is completely ommitted as well. Rather, these are shelfed in order to make room for Buscemi's plots.Rebecca's role is severely shortened and thus we never really get to see who she is. At times she seems cold and downright cruel. Scarlet Johannson does a decent job with what she's given, but although she's very attractive, she doesn't really fit in her character.Thora Birch does a good job as Enid. The scenes with her just being herself and not revolving around Seymour are the best. Her sarcastic behavior at a garage sale and at a movie theater are hillarious.The film also drags and seems boring at times, even depressing. Granted, the graphic novel isn't exactly cheerful but it was still somewhat enjoyable.Overall, it was  a decent film but could have been a lot better.",3,The Steven Buscemi Show,1137801600,"01 21, 2006",2006,2325,"['loved', 'original', 'Daniel', 'Clowes', 'graphic', 'novel', 'found', 'story', 'engaging', 'characters', 'really', 'interesting', 'had', 'read', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'waited', 'came', 'out', 'TV.Mind', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', ""'purist"", 'detail', 'be', 'exactly', 'copiied', 'book', 'long', 'more', 'less', 'stays', 'faithful', 'general', 'plot', 'characters', ""'m"", 'satisfied.Ghost', 'World', 'completely', 'different', 'take', 'book', 'book', 'focused', 'Enid', 'Rebecca', 'relationship', 'film', 'more', 'less', 'spends', 'more', 'time', 'character', 'exclusive', 'film', 'named', 'Seymour', 'nerdy', 'records', 'collector.After', 'while', 'Steven', 'Buscemi', 'character', 'protagonist', 'film', 'came', 'more', 'pathetic', 'sympathetic', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'cringed', 'overall', 'found', 'scenes', 'be', 'boring', 'fact', 'soon', 'smitten', 'girl', 'who', 'just', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'just', 'downright', 'creepy', 'Enid', 'becomes', 'attracted', 'as', 'well', 'reason', 'times', 'somewhat', 'like', ""'One"", 'flew', 'cuckoo', 'nest', 'Chief', 'Bromden', 'may', 'narrate', 'book', 'story', 'centers', 'McMurphy', 'more', 'anyone', 'are', 'still', 'elements', 'book', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'there', 'just', 'be', 'there', 'Enid', ""'friend"", 'who', 'interested', 'serial', 'killers', 'occult', 'pops', 'one', 'two', 'scenes', 'forgotten', 'only', 'reason', 'being', 'well', 'was', 'book', 'love', 'triangle', 'subplot', 'one', 'bigger', 'parts', 'book', 'completely', 'ommitted', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'shelfed', 'order', 'make', 'room', 'Buscemi', 'plots.Rebecca', 'role', 'severely', 'shortened', 'thus', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'see', 'who', 'times', 'cold', 'downright', 'cruel', 'Scarlet', 'Johannson', 'decent', 'job', 'what', 'given', 'very', 'attractive', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit', 'character.Thora', 'Birch', 'good', 'job', 'Enid', 'scenes', 'just', 'being', 'not', 'revolving', 'Seymour', 'are', 'best', 'sarcastic', 'behavior', 'garage', 'sale', 'movie', 'theater', 'are', 'hillarious.The', 'film', 'also', 'boring', 'times', 'even', 'depressing', 'Granted', 'graphic', 'novel', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'cheerful', 'was', 'still', 'somewhat', 'enjoyable.Overall', 'was', 'decent', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better']",N/A

At first I thought it was too long but then I watched it again and realized, it was worth every minute.  Thora Birch is [cute]...as ever and Scarlett Johanson is perfect in one of her first major ""teenager roles"".  I can't wait to see Scarlett in Lost in Translation.  Of course what is an indie film without Steve Buscemi?  He plays the character of Seymour very well and is a veritable imitation of director Terry Swigoff through inspiration of cartoonist Robert Crumb.  Other good performances come from Bob Balaban as Thora's father, his stuttering and spontaniety kept me in stitches!  Brad Renfro was good playing the straight man Josh.  I'd never seen Brad in the Client so seeing his acting was a first for me!  David Sheridan, better known for playing Deputy Doofy in Scary Movie is hilarious here as mullet head punk Doug.  The film is based on a comic book which I bought after seeing the movie and it is wonderfully written and the art is done in all light green.  That's something else to look for throughout this movie.  The color green is in just about every scene.  I also own the soundtrack which has a lot of old blues songs; some taken from the original 78s of Terry Swigoff's own collection.As for the DVD extras.  There are 3 deleted scenes which aren't really necessary; an alternate shot of Illeana Douglas' character showing the infamous pavement pants to some museum gazers telling them its title is ""Wasteland"", and 2 alternate shots of Doug fighting with the convienence store clerk.The DVD contains a soundtrack spot commercial which is nice.The theatrical trailer which as I stated earlier rocks!Theatrical trailers of other DVDs connected with United Artists.A Making of the Film.And finally one of the most funniest extras is the complete ""music video"" of Mohammed Rafi's ""Jaan Pehechan Ho"" playing at the beginning of the film; taken from the 1960s Indian film ""Gumnaam"" which is actually one of the most violent movies in the world but this one part that was used from it is pure 60s rock and roll hilarity.I can really relate to this film.  I myself had no idea my life would turn out the way it did after high school.  I am surprised I have come this far.

So, we have this basic theme about self-deemed losers who are are totally unable (or totally unwilling) to adjust to and interact with the ""Ghost World"" around them.On the surface, the two characters couldn't be anymore different, but both have the same motive for their indifferent attitudes towards the purpose of life.  Enid is an immature teenager with a chip on her shoulder, struggling to find any sense of identity, let alone a direction.  She comes from a broken home, living with a father who scarcely knows her.  40-year-old Seymour is more seasoned and is less nave and more accepting of the way life treats him.  He's an introverted bachelor music-nerd with a slew of unattractive habits and personality traits.  Enid and Seymour are not rebelling from society--they are simply clueless and careless regarding their reputation among others.  They both feel rejected and misunderstood, or as Seymour puts it, `Some people, you just give them a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're satisfied'.  The two of them unite inauspiciously when Enid plays a cruel joke on Seymour, but quickly finds herself inquisitive of the man.  She befriends him, and they hit it off relating to and trying to help each another with their problems.  However, the movie ends with a sense of apathy and despair for both characters.The supporting characters, with the exception of Enid's girlfriend, are chiefly there to add some badly-needed comedy to a somewhat dragging plot.  The actors have a sharp script to sink their teeth into, with Steve Buschemi being the highlight-everything this man touches turns to gold!

This film is brilliant.  We see young girls [and boys] like this all around us.  In fact, we've all but turned our popular culture over to them.  We worship the young, hip, disaffected point of view.  But, this movie lets us see that Enid, for all of her acidic wit, is just a little girl.

Seymour, though he hates phoniness and middle class values, is identified by his love; he's a music collector.  He collects old 78's.  Enid makes an awkward and touching effort to connect with him, throwing herself at him, finally bedding him. In that moment, the film lets you realize as she does that for all of her poses and intelligence, she's not ready to make this kind of step into adulthood.  When Rebecca asks her to join in a ruse to appear as successful young women so they can rent an apartment, Enid dyes her hair green and sports a black leather jacket.  Enid squirms on the same line Holden Caufield straddled in Catcher in the Rye.  The sense of what is lost when one grows up.  Seymour, though an outsider, is self-reflective enough to be wary of his place in a community of what he calls, ""geeky collector losers"" but, he has a place in a community.  Enid, clinging to her youthful rebellion, has no community.  Not even with her friend Rebecca.  She's the eternal outsider, with all of the positives and negatives the film outlines.  In this light, the film's ending, though a little jarring, makes perfect sense.  It's the only ending possible and it leaves you to ponder Enid's future.  Where will she go?  What will she do?  Do we want her to change?  If she were to change, what would she lose and what would she gain?  This film is funny, touching, and leaves us with a lot of pertinent questions.",5,A Sort of Female Catcher In the Rye,1081987200,"04 15, 2004",2004,2347,"['Enid', 'Rebecca', 'are', 'partners', 'world', 'phonies', 'pact', 'move', 'past', 'high', 'school', 'Rebecca', 'endeavors', 'join', 'mainstream', 'Enid', 'out', 'two', 'Enid', 'marked', 'Her', 'fierce', 'almost', 'off-handed', 'intelligence', 'droll', 'put-ons', 'sarcastic', 'wit', 'out', 'movie', 'loneliness', 'film', 'brilliant', 'see', 'young', 'girls', '[', 'boys', ']', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'turned', 'popular', 'culture', 'worship', 'young', 'hip', 'disaffected', 'point', 'view', 'movie', 'see', 'Enid', 'acidic', 'wit', 'just', 'little', 'girl', 'Remember', 'when', 'identified', 'posing', 'everything', 'hated', 'Enid', 'stuck', 'there', 'part', 'what', 'funny', 'attractive', 'stance', 'not', 'easily', 'worn', 'grown', 'up', 'up', 'true', 'outsider', '40', 'year', 'old', 'Seymour', 'Seymour', 'phoniness', 'middle', 'class', 'values', 'identified', 'love', 'music', 'collector', 'old', '78', 'Enid', 'awkward', 'touching', 'effort', 'connect', 'throwing', 'finally', 'bedding', 'moment', 'film', 'realize', 'poses', 'intelligence', 'not', 'ready', 'make', 'kind', 'step', 'adulthood', 'When', 'Rebecca', 'join', 'ruse', 'appear', 'successful', 'young', 'women', 'can', 'rent', 'apartment', 'Enid', 'hair', 'green', 'sports', 'black', 'leather', 'jacket', 'Enid', 'same', 'line', 'Holden', 'Caufield', 'straddled', 'Catcher', 'Rye', 'sense', 'what', 'lost', 'when', 'one', 'up', 'Seymour', 'outsider', 'self-reflective', 'enough', 'be', 'wary', 'place', 'community', 'what', 'geeky', 'collector', 'losers', 'place', 'community', 'Enid', 'clinging', 'youthful', 'rebellion', 'community', 'Not', 'even', 'friend', 'Rebecca', 'eternal', 'outsider', 'positives', 'film', 'outlines', 'light', 'film', 'ending', 'little', 'jarring', 'perfect', 'sense', 'only', 'ending', 'possible', 'ponder', 'Enid', 'future', 'Where', 'will', 'go', 'What', 'will', 'do', 'Do', 'want', 'change', 'were', 'change', 'what', 'would', 'lose', 'what', 'would', 'gain', 'film', 'funny', 'touching', 'lot', 'pertinent', 'questions']",N/A

681424,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005T30L,Reviewer,"[4, 4]","To begin with, let&#8217;s dispel any misconception that his is just another &#8220;teen&#8221; film; the main characters are teens, to be sure, but it is decidedly anything but.  Rather, it&#8217;s an examination of the methods we employ in the attempt to connect with the world in which we live, and how we negotiate our own specific time, place and environment.  A comedy/drama by director Terry Zwigoff, &#8220;Ghost World&#8221; explores what it means to be on the outside looking in, without necessarily wanting to be on the inside, but unsure of what the next move should be or to whom or what we should reach out and embrace.  And, as the story unfolds, we discover that the elusive answers have much to do with our own preferences and perceptions of a world in a constant state of flux that refuses to slow down or wait for us to make our decisions.Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) have just graduated from high school.  Their plans for the future include sharing an apartment-- and so far, that&#8217;s it.  Toward that end, Rebecca has secured a job at a local Starbucks, but Enid is stuck in the procrastination phase, job-search wise.  Be advised, however, these two are no &#8220;Romy and Michele;&#8221; mature beyond their years-- especially Enid-- they have a jaded, cynical view of the world in which they live and those who populate it.  They possess a keen insight into human nature, but regard those around them with a rather cold and detached perspective.  They observe people, Enid sometimes sketching them from a distance, and often they follow their subjects just to see where they go and what they might do.  Life to them is something of an academic character study, with perhaps an underlying sense that by so doing they just may stumble onto their own niche-- though without realizing what they&#8217;re doing themselves.It&#8217;s all fairly harmless, at any rate, until one day they inadvertently get too close to one of their marks, Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a man they view initially as a pathetic little geek.  They initiate an incident involving him that is cruel in the extreme, and when they follow it up rather than just dropping it and letting it (and Seymour) go, their lives take an unexpected turn, and for the first time they get caught up in their own scheme of deceit.  And it&#8217;s a step toward the inevitable changes we all face in our lives-- and slowly they begin to understand at least one thing:  That once the die is cast, there is no going back.From the outset, you realize these characters are not your typical, average cinematic teens, and as the story evolves, Zwigoff does an exemplary job of developing them.  They change, they evolve; and you see it.  And given the fact that this story is adapted from a comic book, there is an unexpected depth to it, along the lines of &#8220;American Beauty&#8221; or &#8220;The Ice Storm.&#8221;  It&#8217;s funny, as well-- hilarious, in fact-- but the humor is never contrived or forced, but flows quite naturally from the characters and their situations, just as in real life where you find that even the most serious situation has a humorous side, though to find it you may have to take a step back and look for it.  Zwigoff allows us to take that step back and see that side, along with the drama; and the result is a film that is funny, incisive, insightful, and at times extremely moving and poignant.  The ending alone is enough to initiate hours of discussion.  Extremely well crafted and delivered, Zwigoff&#8217;s work here should have earned him an Oscar nomination, as it is clearly superior to some that were rewarded with that honor.For years now, in numerous films, from &#8220;Fargo&#8221; to the sleeper &#8220;Trees Lounge,&#8221; Steve Buscemi has been one of the best character actors in the business, and the role of Seymour is arguably his best work to date.  And inexplicably, like Zwigoff, the Academy overlooked him.  Buscemi&#8217;s Seymour is the epitome of a regular guy who, if not exactly content with his life, accepts it and has no delusions as to who and what he is; and Buscemi plays him beautifully.  There&#8217;s a touch of Donnie from &#8220;The Big Lebowski&#8221; in him, but with much more depth, and an attitude that is decidedly acquiescent.  This is a guy who doesn&#8217;t expect much, because he knows he&#8217;ll never get it anyway.  It&#8217;s an engagingly subtle and honest portrayal that also gives definition to the contrast between his stage of life and that of Enid and Rebecca&#8217;s.  Buscemi was perfectly cast in this part-- absolutely no one could have played Seymour better.One of the true revelations of this film, however, is in the emergence of Thora Birch, who turns in an absolutely commanding performance.  All that she&#8217;s done previously has been but a warm-up for her portrayal of Enid, which, without question, will propel her already successful career to an even higher level.  With an understated and oh-so-subtle manner, she manages to convey so much about what is going on behind Enid&#8217;s eyes; all the emotion, all the confusion that hides behind her mask of external indifference.  Birch knows her character inside and out, and presents Enid accordingly, letting us know unequivocally how she feels about those around her, including Rebecca, her father (Bob Balaban), and especially Seymour-- through her relationship with whom we learn so much about her.  It&#8217;s terrific work by an extremely gifted young actor.Johansson gives a striking performance, as well, though her character is ultimately overshadowed by Birch&#8217;s Enid.  But it&#8217;s good work, and one of the strengths of the film.The supporting cast includes Brad Renfro (Josh), Illeana Douglas (Roberta) and Stacy Travis (Dana).  Filled with memorable characters and scenes, &#8220;Ghost World&#8221; is a thoughtful and highly entertaining film, deservedly recognized with an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay.

681431,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005T30L,Roland E. Zwick,"[9, 10]","""Ghost World"" is a rare movie find, a shrewdly observant tale of societal outcasts that, in its own low-keyed, understated way, offers profound insights into the workings of human nature.  It is rare to see a film this confident in its purpose and tone.  Writer/director Terry Zwigoff and co-writer Daniel Clowes have fashioned a tale totally lacking in the sort of sensationalistic melodrama that blights so many films dealing with the issue of teenage alienation and angst.  Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson portray Enid and Rebecca, two long time friends who have just been released from that prison known as high school and are now forced to make their way in a world full of people towards whom they feel utterly contemptuous.  Enid and Rebecca, like many youngsters who find it hard to fit in, camouflage their insecurities in a cloak of blas&eacute; cynicism, adopting a tone of superiority to all the ""cool"" people who have rejected them.  Indeed, to these two young women, even being ""cool"" is uncool, so they comfort each other with the knowledge that they are simply too good for the society around them.  The problem is that while this ""pose"" may suffice to get one through high school, it becomes a definite hindrance when one is confronted by the realities of life on the outside - finding a job, planning a future, establishing relationships.In the latter department, Enid finds herself drawn to an awkward middle-aged man named Seymour (Steve Buscemi), who is, in many ways, an older version of herself, a socially backward ""dork"" who frankly admits that the reason he collects so much memorabilia is because he prefers objects to people.  Enid and Seymour strike up a tentative relationship, but what makes ""Ghost World"" so extraordinary is that we never quite know where the story is going.  The writers don't go for the obvious plot turns so that, even by the end, although we leave the film feeling satisfied, we don't sense that all the loose ends have been tied up into a nice neat little package for our facile consumption.  In fact, it is the very ambiguous, open-ended nature of the film that makes it seem so truthful.  Even the characters remain strangely enigmatic throughout.  Rebecca begins to feel the stirrings of conformity as she starts working at a job and looking for an apartment in a conventional suburban neighborhood.  This tension causes the girls to start drifting apart, as does Enid's sudden interest in Seymour, a relationship Rebecca begins to view with a measure of jealousy and resentment.  Enid is also very recognizable in her refusal to confront the people who mean the most to her when times of conflict or crisis arise - preferring to let her answering machine cope with her problems for her, in the vain (but all too human) belief that by screening her calls she will also be screening herself from some of the problems she has helped to create.  We also see how these generally lost, but well-intentioned people, allow themselves to do very hurtful things to the people they love.  The emotional terrain of this film is surprisingly credible and complex.As far as I can tell, there is really not an untrue moment in ""Ghost World.""  It creates fascinating characters and remains true to them to the end, never requiring them to utter a false-sounding statement or indulge in cheap theatricalities to get the point across.

681432,A2GQOI25E6UY25,B00005T30L,RolloTomasi,"[28, 31]","Terry Zwigoff's ""Ghost World"" is that rarest of hybrids -- a human comedy, brilliantly and bizarrely funny, but suffused with a profound sense of melancholia. The experience of watching it is deliriously pleasurable, but the humor emerges from the film's unfailingly generous reservoir of empathy; by the end, you're not sure whether to respond to these characters with laughter or with love. It is quite clear that Zwigoff feels both.And that's what critics of this fine film have overlooked -- that although 17-year-old Enid (Thora Birch) looks at the world with bitter, unremittingly sarcastic eyes, ""Ghost World"" couldn't be less cynical or judgmental if it tried. Of all the characters on display, most of whom Enid despises and ridicules, there isn't a single one who isn't really good at heart; even the art teacher (a ridiculously funny Illeana Douglas), who has been derided as a one-dimensional caricature, has an untouchable core of decency.Indeed, the character for whom ""Ghost World"" retains the harshest criticism is Enid herself. As much as we adore her terrifying intelligence, her single-mindedly retro fashion sense, and her contempt for all things phony and pretentious, we aren't allowed to forget her self-destructive habits or her unwillingness to grow up even as the world around her charges resolutely forward. Her best friend, Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson), once her partner in crime, has taken on a normalcy and sense of perspective that Enid finds tiresome, which is partly why she takes refuge in a lonely middle-aged bachelor named Seymour (Steve Buscemi, in a shoulda-been-Oscar-nominated performance). Their bond is at once improbable and emotionally convincing, and Zwigoff harmonizes Birch's and Buscemi's own highly idiosyncratic styles into a marvelous, unforced chemistry.Compassionate and subtly optimistic, ""Ghost World"" only falters slightly with a few misfired pop-culture references and an ending that's both ambiguous and too overstated, but even that misstep proves strangely satisfying. With a character as unforgettable as Enid, it's good to know that there's such a thing as closure -- even if it's open-ended closure.",4,Accentuate the positive,1019260800,"04 20, 2002",2002,2163,"['Terry', 'Zwigoff', 'Ghost', 'World', 'rarest', 'hybrids', 'human', 'comedy', 'brilliantly', 'bizarrely', 'funny', 'suffused', 'profound', 'sense', 'melancholia', 'experience', 'watching', 'deliriously', 'pleasurable', 'humor', 'film', 'unfailingly', 'generous', 'reservoir', 'empathy', 'end', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'respond', 'characters', 'laughter', 'love', 'quite', 'clear', 'Zwigoff', 'feels', 'both.And', 'what', 'critics', 'fine', 'film', 'have', 'overlooked', '17-year-old', 'Enid', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'world', 'bitter', 'unremittingly', 'sarcastic', 'eyes', 'Ghost', 'World', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'less', 'cynical', 'judgmental', 'tried', 'characters', 'display', 'most', 'whom', 'Enid', 'despises', 'ridicules', ""n't"", 'single', 'one', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'good', 'heart', 'even', 'art', 'teacher', 'ridiculously', 'funny', 'Illeana', 'Douglas', 'who', 'been', 'derided', 'one-dimensional', 'caricature', 'untouchable', 'core', 'decency.Indeed', 'character', 'whom', 'Ghost', 'World', 'harshest', 'criticism', 'Enid', 'As', 'much', 'adore', 'terrifying', 'intelligence', 'single-mindedly', 'retro', 'fashion', 'sense', 'contempt', 'things', 'phony', 'pretentious', 'are', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'forget', 'self-destructive', 'habits', 'unwillingness', 'grow', 'up', 'even', 'world', 'charges', 'resolutely', 'forward', 'best', 'friend', 'Rebecca', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'once', 'partner', 'crime', 'taken', 'normalcy', 'sense', 'perspective', 'Enid', 'tiresome', 'partly', 'why', 'refuge', 'lonely', 'middle-aged', 'bachelor', 'named', 'Seymour', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'shoulda-been-Oscar-nominated', 'performance', 'bond', 'once', 'improbable', 'emotionally', 'convincing', 'Zwigoff', 'Birch', 'Buscemi', 'own', 'highly', 'idiosyncratic', 'styles', 'marvelous', 'unforced', 'chemistry.Compassionate', 'subtly', 'optimistic', 'Ghost', 'World', 'only', 'slightly', 'few', 'misfired', 'pop-culture', 'references', 'ending', 'ambiguous', 'too', 'overstated', 'even', 'misstep', 'strangely', 'satisfying', 'character', 'as', 'unforgettable', 'Enid', 'good', 'know', 'such', 'thing', 'closure', 'even', 'open-ended', 'closure']",N/A
681433,A5KJVGJ43ZDC9,B00005T30L,Ronald Battista,"[3, 3]","""Ghost World"" is based on a serial comic by ""Eightball"" scrawler Dan Clowes, who has a knack for examining pitiful characters without regard for the readers' tolerance of weird. I'm a regular reader of his work, and to hear that something of his was going to hit the major screen, I was amazed and thrilled. Im also waiting for Pete Bagge's Buddy Bradley to make his screen debut too, but I wont hold my breath.When I first heard this was going to be made, I was expecting a full length cartoon, where the characters drift through a blue, black, and gray urban world like the comic. What we get instead is a live, semi-colorful, middle class, just near the suburbs world of convenience and sameness. Kind of like the town I grew up in. Thora Birch plays Enid Coleslaw, and she is mind bogglingly adorable as the pesky, dowdy, splay footed smart aleck  high school grad with an affectation for combat boots and outre culture. The movie spends a slow half hour accustoming the audience to Enid and her girlfriend Rebecca's weltaanschung of sarcasm and disdain for everything around them. This is the essence of the ""ghost world"", I believe; they disassociate with everything around them to the point where nothing good is tangible, where nothing happens, just like they expect it to. This, in and of itself, would be relatively intolerable for two hours...enter Steve Buscemi's character, who plays me...I mean..Seymour, another member of a ""ghost world"" except he's almost 40. He's an obsessive collector of old music and nostalgia that Enid befriends, and this is where the movie begins to build drama. You can see that these two have everything in common except age and station. They both choose to withdraw from the culture that has judged them inferior. What follows is a suffocating, tragic friendship that Enid can only mess up because she discovers that she is truly scared of everything, and after all, only 18. You wish them to be together, but their ghost worlds drift apart because their union is just as frightening as anything else. There is no happy ending here. In fact, this isn't even a comedy; anyone expecting a slacker send up has rented the wrong movie for the evening. There is nothing exploitative in this film at all, no violence and no sex, just enough claustrophobic human emotion to make anyone squirm. See if your ghost world is like theirs.",4,Disturbingly familiar,1013472000,"02 12, 2002",2002,2368,"['Ghost', 'World', 'based', 'serial', 'comic', 'Eightball', 'scrawler', 'Dan', 'Clowes', 'who', 'knack', 'examining', 'pitiful', 'characters', 'regard', 'readers', 'tolerance', 'weird', ""'m"", 'regular', 'reader', 'work', 'hear', 'something', 'was', 'going', 'hit', 'major', 'screen', 'was', 'amazed', 'thrilled', 'Im', 'also', 'waiting', 'Pete', 'Bagge', 'Buddy', 'Bradley', 'make', 'screen', 'debut', 'too', 'wont', 'hold', 'breath.When', 'first', 'heard', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'made', 'was', 'expecting', 'full', 'length', 'cartoon', 'where', 'characters', 'drift', 'blue', 'black', 'gray', 'urban', 'world', 'comic', 'What', 'get', 'instead', 'live', 'semi-colorful', 'middle', 'class', 'just', 'suburbs', 'world', 'convenience', 'sameness', 'Kind', 'town', 'grew', 'up', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'Enid', 'Coleslaw', 'mind', 'bogglingly', 'adorable', 'pesky', 'dowdy', 'splay', 'footed', 'smart', 'aleck', 'high', 'school', 'grad', 'affectation', 'combat', 'boots', 'outre', 'culture', 'movie', 'slow', 'half', 'hour', 'accustoming', 'audience', 'Enid', 'girlfriend', 'Rebecca', 'weltaanschung', 'sarcasm', 'disdain', 'everything', 'essence', 'ghost', 'world', 'believe', 'disassociate', 'everything', 'point', 'where', 'nothing', 'good', 'tangible', 'where', 'nothing', 'just', 'expect', 'would', 'be', 'relatively', 'intolerable', 'two', 'hours', 'enter', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'character', 'who', 'mean..Seymour', 'member', 'ghost', 'world', 'almost', '40', 'obsessive', 'collector', 'old', 'music', 'nostalgia', 'Enid', 'befriends', 'where', 'movie', 'build', 'drama', 'can', 'see', 'two', 'have', 'everything', 'common', 'age', 'station', 'choose', 'withdraw', 'culture', 'judged', 'inferior', 'What', 'suffocating', 'tragic', 'friendship', 'Enid', 'can', 'only', 'mess', 'up', 'truly', 'scared', 'everything', 'only', '18', 'wish', 'be', 'together', 'ghost', 'worlds', 'drift', 'apart', 'union', 'just', 'as', 'frightening', 'anything', 'else', 'happy', 'ending', 'here', 'fact', ""n't"", 'even', 'comedy', 'anyone', 'expecting', 'slacker', 'send', 'up', 'rented', 'wrong', 'movie', 'evening', 'nothing', 'exploitative', 'film', 'violence', 'sex', 'just', 'enough', 'claustrophobic', 'human', 'emotion', 'make', 'anyone', 'squirm', 'See', 'ghost', 'world', 'theirs']",N/A
681434,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00005T30L,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[2, 7]","Steve Buscemi and Thora Birch star in this misfire attempt to film the graphic novel ""Ghost World"".  I'm not sure who this flick will disappoint more - those who've read the original and will nitpick over the differences, or those who have no familiarity with Daniel Clowes's offbeat characters, and may have no other reason to bond with the characters.  Like the original the movie tells of the what may be the end of a great friendship - the final summer for Enid and Rebecca.  With high school over, their ideas of the future (vague at first, but soon to reveal themselves as painfully distinct) may tear them apart.  Enid and Rebecca aren't so much as friends as two girls of similar age who loathe themselves and the entire world, but strangely not each other.  In their minds, the world is surrounded by freaks and fakes about whom they pursue, joke and otherwise exploit ruthlessly.The film gets the graphic novel's surface gloss right - John Ellis, Josh, the creeps who hang out at the ""Zine-o-Phobia"", the Satanists, Melorra, Enid's lame father, that ""Weird Al"" looking waiter (not played by ""Weird Al"" though) and that pair of pants that nobody ever picks off the street.  Now, Enid must take summer art classes to get her HS diploma.  A gifted cartoonist in the Daniel Clowes vein, Enid must nevertheless pass muster with a dippy art school teacher (Ileanna Douglas) and her PC students.  More significantly, the flick bravely tries splitting the friendship between Rebecca and Enid who finds herself drawn to another.  While the original Enid had desires, the flick gives her the chance for a real relationship.  In the book, Enid and Rebecca cruelly prank an older guy with a faked personal ad.  While the graphic novel victim dissappears in a cloud of anger, the flick hangs onto him - turning him into a luckless, feckless misanthrope with a name to match: Seymour (Steve Buscemi).  Curious at first, Enid gets closer to Seymour determined to help guide the guy to a real relationship, one apart from the losers who share his love of old 78 records.  Determined to use her powers for good and not evil, Enid becomes determined get Seymour snagged.  Unfortunately, when efforts prove successful, and Seymour improbably snags the woman of his dreams, Enid begins to realize her own feelings for Seymour.  Unsure of what she wants, Enid's mixed-up life begins to strain her relationship with Rebecca (with whom she's apartment hunting) and her art classes (which she must take to graduate HS).""Ghost"" the graphic novel was an enigma, a grab bag of mixed-up tricks and treats.  The flick seems impenetrable, unfortunately to the guys who wrote it, and it's not as sucessful at turning the original's episodic storyline into a coherent narartive.  Seymour's painfully underwritten, especially given Buscemi's normal gift for banter - and nothing explains why Enid's attracted to him.  He ofcourse finds her beautiful, which is a problem - Enid wasn't supposed to be beautiful.  Not to be true to the original for the sake of authenticity, but Thora Birch is simply too radiant (if malevolently so) and youthful to play the self-loathing Enid.  Enid's secret desire is to suddenly become someone else and leave home forever.  In the novel, that works, but it doesn't seem to go with the rest of the movie, making the final shot (or panel) look forced - what is she supposed to be running from.  The flick also suffers the loss of Bob Skeetes, a mysterious seer whose few appearances in the story are more than compensated by the presence he casts over Enid's world.IN SUM: If you never read GW, you'll probably spend most of your time just scratiching your head.  If you loved GW so much that you'll do anything to see Thora Birch say ""Joey McCobb, he's our god!!"" this is your flick.",3,Not sure who will like this flick,1069027200,"11 17, 2003",2003,3793,"['Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'star', 'misfire', 'attempt', 'film', 'graphic', 'novel', 'Ghost', 'World', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'who', 'flick', 'will', 'disappoint', 'more', 'who', ""'ve"", 'read', 'original', 'will', 'nitpick', 'differences', 'who', 'have', 'familiarity', 'Daniel', 'Clowes', 'offbeat', 'characters', 'may', 'have', 'other', 'reason', 'bond', 'characters', 'original', 'movie', 'tells', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'end', 'great', 'friendship', 'final', 'summer', 'Enid', 'Rebecca', 'high', 'school', 'ideas', 'future', 'vague', 'first', 'soon', 'reveal', 'painfully', 'distinct', 'may', 'tear', 'apart', 'Enid', 'Rebecca', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'friends', 'two', 'girls', 'similar', 'age', 'who', 'loathe', 'entire', 'world', 'strangely', 'not', 'other', 'minds', 'world', 'surrounded', 'freaks', 'fakes', 'whom', 'pursue', 'joke', 'otherwise', 'exploit', 'ruthlessly.The', 'film', 'graphic', 'novel', 'surface', 'gloss', 'right', 'John', 'Ellis', 'Josh', 'creeps', 'who', 'hang', 'out', 'Zine-o-Phobia', 'Satanists', 'Melorra', 'Enid', 'lame', 'father', 'Weird', 'Al', 'looking', 'waiter', 'not', 'played', 'Weird', 'Al', 'pair', 'pants', 'nobody', 'ever', 'street', 'Now', 'Enid', 'must', 'take', 'summer', 'art', 'get', 'HS', 'diploma', 'gifted', 'cartoonist', 'Daniel', 'Clowes', 'vein', 'Enid', 'must', 'nevertheless', 'pass', 'muster', 'dippy', 'art', 'school', 'teacher', 'Ileanna', 'Douglas', 'PC', 'students', 'More', 'significantly', 'flick', 'bravely', 'splitting', 'friendship', 'Rebecca', 'Enid', 'who', 'drawn', 'original', 'Enid', 'had', 'desires', 'flick', 'chance', 'real', 'relationship', 'book', 'Enid', 'Rebecca', 'cruelly', 'prank', 'older', 'guy', 'faked', 'personal', 'ad', 'graphic', 'novel', 'victim', 'dissappears', 'cloud', 'anger', 'flick', 'hangs', 'turning', 'luckless', 'feckless', 'misanthrope', 'name', 'match', 'Seymour', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Curious', 'first', 'Enid', 'closer', 'Seymour', 'determined', 'help', 'guide', 'guy', 'real', 'relationship', 'one', 'apart', 'losers', 'who', 'share', 'love', 'old', '78', 'records', 'Determined', 'use', 'powers', 'good', 'not', 'evil', 'Enid', 'determined', 'get', 'Seymour', 'snagged', 'Unfortunately', 'when', 'efforts', 'prove', 'successful', 'Seymour', 'improbably', 'snags', 'woman', 'dreams', 'Enid', 'realize', 'own', 'feelings', 'Seymour', 'Unsure', 'what', 'Enid', 'mixed-up', 'life', 'strain', 'relationship', 'Rebecca', 'whom', 'apartment', 'hunting', 'art', 'classes', 'must', 'take', 'graduate', 'HS', 'Ghost', 'graphic', 'novel', 'was', 'enigma', 'grab', 'bag', 'mixed-up', 'tricks', 'treats', 'flick', 'impenetrable', 'unfortunately', 'guys', 'who', 'wrote', 'not', 'as', 'sucessful', 'turning', 'original', 'episodic', 'storyline', 'coherent', 'narartive', 'Seymour', 'painfully', 'underwritten', 'especially', 'given', 'Buscemi', 'normal', 'gift', 'banter', 'nothing', 'explains', 'why', 'Enid', 'attracted', 'ofcourse', 'beautiful', 'problem', 'Enid', 'was', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'beautiful', 'Not', 'be', 'true', 'original', 'sake', 'authenticity', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'simply', 'too', 'radiant', 'malevolently', 'so', 'youthful', 'play', 'self-loathing', 'Enid', 'Enid', 'secret', 'desire', 'suddenly', 'become', 'someone', 'else', 'leave', 'home', 'forever', 'novel', ""n't"", 'seem', 'go', 'rest', 'movie', 'making', 'final', 'shot', 'panel', 'look', 'forced', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'running', 'flick', 'also', 'loss', 'Bob', 'Skeetes', 'mysterious', 'seer', 'few', 'appearances', 'story', 'are', 'more', 'compensated', 'presence', 'Enid', 'world.IN', 'SUM', 'never', 'read', 'GW', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'just', 'scratiching', 'head', 'loved', 'GW', 'so', 'much', ""'ll"", 'do', 'anything', 'see', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'say', 'Joey', 'McCobb', 'god', 'flick']",N/A

It is a coming of age drama, but does have some very funny moments. That guy in the convenience store parking lot, to the art teacher(Illeana Douglas-always fun to watch), to the girls getting hit on at the pathetic 'party'. It even messed around with some of the themes from Clerks, dealing with annoying customers at a crap job.We all experienced what the two main characters did right after high school. Dissociation with the adult world, but finding out that their old life is now gone, and they are left in a void and have to find their own way out. The gradual way that the two girls grew apart is spot on. Going from close friends, to distant acquaintances over the first few months of graduation. Of course, most people are not quite as cynical and mean, but that didn't detract from the movie.Steve Buscemi's character was perfectly played. This is one of his strongest roles, IMO better than he was in Reservoir Dogs or Fargo. I think those that liked this movie are more like him, despising the mentality of the majority, the shallow and throw away society that is America. Those who disliked it, are probably more like the lady he met in the bar: accepting mediocrity with a smile and never looking beneath the surface. I think that is why people either love or hate it. They either identify with the characters and story, or dislike having a critical spotlight shined in their faces.My only issue with this movie is that it does drag just a little.There is a lot to see in this wonderful film, you just have to work a bit to find them, and that makes it all the more enjoyable.",4,Great movie,1292198400,"12 13, 2010",2010,1675,"['odd', 'reason', 'was', 'marketed', 'laugh', 'floor', 'comedy', 'not', 'coming', 'age', 'drama', 'have', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'guy', 'convenience', 'store', 'parking', 'lot', 'art', 'teacher', 'Illeana', 'Douglas-always', 'fun', 'watch', 'girls', 'getting', 'hit', 'pathetic', ""'party"", 'even', 'messed', 'around', 'themes', 'Clerks', 'dealing', 'annoying', 'customers', 'crap', 'job.We', 'experienced', 'what', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'did', 'right', 'high', 'school', 'Dissociation', 'adult', 'world', 'finding', 'out', 'old', 'life', 'now', 'gone', 'are', 'left', 'void', 'have', 'find', 'own', 'way', 'gradual', 'way', 'two', 'girls', 'grew', 'apart', 'spot', 'Going', 'close', 'friends', 'distant', 'acquaintances', 'first', 'few', 'months', 'graduation', 'course', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'cynical', 'mean', 'did', ""n't"", 'detract', 'movie.Steve', 'Buscemi', 'character', 'was', 'perfectly', 'played', 'one', 'strongest', 'roles', 'IMO', 'better', 'was', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'Fargo', 'think', 'liked', 'movie', 'are', 'more', 'despising', 'mentality', 'majority', 'shallow', 'throw', 'away', 'society', 'America', 'who', 'disliked', 'are', 'probably', 'more', 'lady', 'met', 'bar', 'accepting', 'mediocrity', 'smile', 'never', 'looking', 'surface', 'think', 'why', 'people', 'love', 'hate', 'identify', 'characters', 'story', 'dislike', 'having', 'critical', 'spotlight', 'shined', 'faces.My', 'only', 'issue', 'movie', 'drag', 'just', 'little.There', 'lot', 'see', 'wonderful', 'film', 'just', 'have', 'work', 'bit', 'find', 'more', 'enjoyable']",N/A

It presents a world that closely resembles this one, but with an extra edge of absurdity and lack of any happy, substantial people or fulfilling options, all of which reflects and gives reason to Enid's alienated view of life.  The film does a good job of presenting some attractive and unattractive aspects of her view.  She has a sharp wit and a sharp eye for things that are cool among the ironic kitsch/retro crowd, the mood of which drenches the film.  She finds she can also appreciate good traditional music, with no irony, as long as it's from another time than her own--she needs to stand apart.  At the same time, she is vulnerable to criticism, especially from those who might be more cool than she.  She's too insecure to pursue a normal boy she likes.  The film shows how her attitudes and choices hurt others and herself, but because she has a heart Enid remains a basically attractive character.  Her relationships with her high school friend and with an unhappy older eccentric, Seymour, whom she admires, are shown with subtlety and sharpness.  Much of what Enid does, says and sees is fun and funny, which is for some viewers what defines the mood of the film.Enid's final decision, whatever we're supposed to imagine it was, can be contrasted with her friend Seymour's talk about getting back to his old life, which Enid pretty well destroyed, and which seems a pretty unattractive option.  Indeed, this film shows no interest in making any option look all that attractive.  It's more a look at the alienation and lack of direction, leavened with irony and humor.A note on the ending.  *Spoiler Alert!*  If the filmmakers intended to make the ending ambiguous, they could have done better.  A retro completely unmarked bus in a city with modern busses (as shown early in the last scene) that requires no money or ticket on a route that there is no bus on with no other riders and no other traffic driving over a bridge into the night, all to quiet sweetly melancholic music ending with a drawn out cello note and a fade to black.

The comedy here is not the laugh out loud type (although in some parts I just couldn't help cracking up), it's more the intelligent chuckle type. The film features Thora Birch and Scarlett Johanssen as two very cynical high school graduates, Enid and Rebecca respectively, who torture and ridicule the pop culture infested folks around them. They find joy in calling up people in the personal ads, inviting them on a date and then watching the stood up person's agony. But things change when they play this trick on Seymour (played by a brilliant Steve Buscemi), a dorky, avid collector of records and 1930's memorobilia. What enfolds is a story that could be called a coming of age one. Enid and Rebecca realize that they are growing apart in ways they can't help. The film is directed with ease by Terry Zwigoff and features amazing performances from all involved. The story features some seriously screwed up characters included a man named Norm who waits day in and day out for a bus that never comes and a video store worker who mistakes Fellini's '8 1/2' for the soft core porn '9 1/2 Weeks'.

A dark comedy about a teenager's frustration with setting out on the road to self-discovery and coming to a dead end.The dialogue is nimble, the music apt, and the screenplay a refreshing change from the pat assembly-line teenybop flicks cranked out several times a year by Hollywood. The plot is peripheral, it's the characters and a fluid narrative that take center-stage.As delightfully droll but cynical 17 year-olds facing the first challenges of adulthood -- leaving home, getting a job, finding a love life -- the two female protagonists do a fabulous job of coming across as outsiders among their peers never quite trying to ""fit in"".In what begins as a harmless goof, one of them finds herself drawn to schleppy forty-something Seymour (Buscemi), a regular Joe and collector of 78rpm records. You know Buscemi from character roles in a bunch of popular movies, including Reservoir Dogs; all pent-up cynicism and inherent geekiness, he couldn't be more perfect in this role.Thrown in are other interesting caricatures of some pretty credible small town characters, notably an art teacher who got more inane with every highfalutin bit of art she expounded on high school kids.Thankfully, the movie resists the temptation of convenient closures so some may take issue with how it all turns out for the teenage girl and the middle age geek.

But from time to time something comes out of the American film industry that puts one back in touch with the reasons one had for starting to love movies in the first place and is a joy to watch from start to finish. And his must be one of the best movies to come out of 2001 from any country.Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson are Enid and Rebecca, two high school graduates is an anonymous small American town. They are cool, cynical, contemptuous of all around them and desperately desperately ironic. They are so knowingly disengaged as to come out on the other side of cool in a place that is really a bit pathetic. They are completely adorable and hilariously funny.The  script - by Daniel Clowes and Terry Zwigoff - Clowes wrote the graphic novel (which I haven't read) it is based on-  is perfection: razor sharp, witty, intelligent and perceptive. And it is perfectly realized by the cast. Birch and Johansson are so good that even Steve Buscemi, who has stolen most films he has appeared in and who has done nothing better, fails to steal this one. And Illeana Douglas is perfect too as a dumb ditzy hippie art teacher.Buscemi plays Seymour, a lonely nerdy middle aged man who lives for his collection of old blues records. (""Actually, technically, what he was mostly playing would more accurately be classified in the ragtime idiom..."") Enid and Rebecca meet him by way of looking through lonely hearts ads for losers to laugh at and call him up for a wheeze. Only Enid at least bites off more than she can chew and finds herself liking him: ""In a way, he's such a clueless dork, he's almost kinda cool."" So she sets herself up, a la Diane Keaton in ""Play It Again Sam"", as his find-a-girlfriend consultant. Only, of course, that's not quite where things are heading and, given the demographics, it can only end in tears. Meanwhile Rebecca shows signs of starting to outpace Enid in shedding the teenage supercool poses and turning into a rather ordinary middle-American and the friendship starts to show a certain strain.The main theme is a straightforward one but one rarely if ever better handled on film. It's about pretty well everyone in their late teens - desperately trying to strike all manner of cool punk attitudes, but in reality clueless, confused and vulnerable. Birch and Johansson are skilled enough comic actresses to bring the former characteristic off to wonderfully exaggerated effect; but also good enough all round actresses to bring the latter off tremendously as well.

Thora Birch gives a great performance.Unfortunately, ""Ghost World"" wants to be ""Catcher in the Rye"" and it can never be.  The problem is not that Enid isn't Holden Caulfield (she very nearly is) but that Daniel Clowes and Terry Zwigoff aren't J. D. Salinger.  In short, the story accepts too much of Enid's point of view -- all of the people she mocks really are as shallow as they seem to her, including the most well-developed characters (like Seymour).  Clowes and Zwigoff populate her town with a melange of standard laugh-at-able stereotypes and freaks, but can't conjure up anyone to offer Enid perspective or guidance.Even the lonely old man on the bus stop bench misguides her.  His role is that of the mythological 'unrecognized seer/sage' who appears on the fringe to offer a way out of the world's madness through his own apparent insanity.

Any role she plays is always done with such a passion; I am still scratching my head as to why she doesn't get roles that show what kind of talent that lady really has.  If you've seen the HBO series ""Six Feet Under"" I don't think there is anyone out there that has seen it that can honestly say they weren't moved or totally annoyed by her briefly displayed character in that series.  The irony is, her character ""made"" that series and provided something no other actress could have pulled off.  Well, Ileana does a little number in ""Ghost World"" too.  You can honestly look at her character and know there is not one actress in Hollywood that can pull off playing an overtly passionate art teacher like Ileana!  She's brilliant!  Unfortunately, this movie isn't!  It moves too slowly, has a dull plot, uses other extremely talented actors to play dumb-downed roles and fires jokes off at random without a punchline.  There are moments in ""Ghost World"" that are reminiscent of ""Romi and Michelle's High School Reunion,"" (a far better film that uses humor as a background and not as the focus of the story) which makes me think this film doesn't really have much originality.  Countless movies have been made using the Goth genre as the setting for much more engaging stories but this movie simply doesn't bring home the bacon.

""Pop Culture Addict""","[2, 2]","Terry Zwigoff's ""Ghost World"" is an adaptation of Daniel Clowes' graphic novel and is quite simply one of the best films of 2001. All filmgoers who felt that Thora Birch was a mountain of potential after seeing her in ""American Beauty"" have had their assessments validated - she gives the performance of her young career. Her character not only reminds you of the exact things that ran through your mind when you were 18, but also shows how much more sophisticated the current generation of teens have become in verbalizing these thoughts. The current teen is a master of intermixing angst, irony, humor, and insight and Birch is their perfect embodiment. ""Ghost World"" follows the adventures of Enid (Birch) and her best friend Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson). After both girls graduate high school, the question both of them have is ""what's next?"" ""What's next"" is Rebecca trying to make a life for herself and Enid choosing to remain in her world of irrelevance and mischief. However, she soon reassesses her life when she starts to fall in love with a kindred spirit in Seymour (Steve Buscemi). Yet this love does not stabilize her life, instead it makes it more chaotic and leads Enid to make a fateful decision that closes the film. Birch and Johansson are great and Buscemi adds a new vulnerable dimension to the trademark neurotic supporting performance he so often gives. Special ackowledgement must also be given to director Zwigoff who makes a seamless transition from making documentaries to making a feature. All in all, ""Ghost World"" is a wonderful cinematic experience and an ideal candidate for future cult status.",4,"""We graduated high school.

It appeals more to the teenager who feels the same way  Enid does. (Love her name btw) Thora Birch truly brings out the &quot;Daria&quot; like depressing charm in this not-so-unique but well done role. BTW-She looked absolutely cute through out this whole film, I totally fell for her with that short black hair, bold glasses, and perky outfits. She is such a doll! Too bad it seems like she lost all that weight now. ANYWAYThe movie has some great comedic moments following our pal Enid through her pessimistic look at life. Like when she get's a job at the theatre and the art class scenes to name two. While at first it seems creepy  that she likes this old dude Steve Buscemi they each have a charm that makes them perfect for eachother. Steve plays the dud like no one else can, but he always has a dignity about him. The movie is colorfuly and is really nice to watch it has a 50's charm in the decor and feel of the sets. The supporting cast is a riot and makes for an all round good 2hrs of film.The film is not flawed though, while I'm all for endings that one can discuss with others. I feel that the Enid character didn't have any sort of redemption at the end. She talked about dissapointing everyone, and yet does nothing to fix this. I felt so bad for Steve at the end that I just couldn't appreciate what happens at the end. I know it's  supposed to symbolize that their ARE NO certainties in life, and there will always be things that suprise you.

That zone where you have to face the music and decide who you really are, what you want to be, and how you are going to get there.

Slightly chunky, wearing dark mismatched clothes, Birch accurately channels the spirit of a dissatisfied teenager. Scarlet Johansson is also very good as the second half of this relationship. More willing to adapt to the outside world, she is sort of the flipside of this record. A bit off the wall, but also more mainstream. The situations that they become involved in seem completely natural. It just seems natural for Enid to buy a leather cat woman mask at an adult book store. It just seems natural for Enid to wear the same mask proudly on the street.Steve Buscemi is brilliant as Seymour. Seymour is the type of guy who has let life pass him by. Forty something and still living with a roommate, he seems to covet his rare records than he does a relationship, causing him to be awkward and tentative when confronted by women.Illeana Douglas is also memorable as the summer school art teacher, the perfect embodiment of an artist who is struggling to make ends meet. It could be a caricature, but I have seen people like this in real life, and she captures it perfectly.Zwigoff has a decidedly offbeat sense of humor. His film is intelligent, thoughtful and very funny. The differences between this film and any mainstream studio effort at comedy (i.e., `American Pie', `Rush Hour 2') is that the comedy comes from natural situations, believable situations, which makes the comedy seem more real, more memorable and more funny.""Ghost World"" is a great film and will most likely be on my list of best films of the year.",4,A New Classic,1113264000,"04 12, 2005",2005,2649,"['Enid', 'Rebecca', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'have', 'just', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'Part', 'anti-social', 'crowd', 'hate', 'just', 'everything', 'make', 'fun', 'everything', 'else', 'Enid', 'happy', 'enough', 'live', 'way', 'rest', 'life', 'Rebecca', 'soon', 'job', 'looking', 'apartment', 'earnest', 'Enid', 'fascinated', 'Seymour', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'rare', 'record', 'collector', 'set-up', 'false', 'blind', 'date', 'genuinely', 'Seymour', 'become', 'friends', 'Enid', 'Seymour', 'become', 'closer', 'Rebecca', 'towards', 'more', 'normal', 'middle-class', 'life', 'Ghost', 'World', 'directed', 'Terry', 'Zwigoff', 'Crumb', 'written', 'Zwigoff', 'Daniel', 'Clowes', 'have', 'created', 'really', 'wonderful', 'comic', 'film', 'Clowes', 'Zwigoff', 'have', 'adapted', 'Clowes', 'graphic', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'film', 'original', 'funny', 'very', 'memorable.Thora', 'Birch', 'American', 'Beauty', 'Enid', '18', 'year', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'graduate', 'who', 'floundering', 'bit', 'now', ""n't"", 'have', 'security', 'high', 'school', 'As', 'much', 'hated', 'provided', 'structure', 'Now', 'be', 'working', 'overtime', 'find', 'things', 'amuse', 'Slightly', 'chunky', 'wearing', 'dark', 'mismatched', 'clothes', 'Birch', 'accurately', 'spirit', 'dissatisfied', 'teenager', 'Scarlet', 'Johansson', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'second', 'half', 'relationship', 'More', 'willing', 'adapt', 'outside', 'world', 'sort', 'flipside', 'record', 'bit', 'wall', 'also', 'more', 'mainstream', 'situations', 'become', 'involved', 'seem', 'completely', 'natural', 'just', 'natural', 'Enid', 'buy', 'leather', 'cat', 'woman', 'mask', 'adult', 'book', 'store', 'just', 'natural', 'Enid', 'wear', 'same', 'mask', 'proudly', 'street.Steve', 'Buscemi', 'brilliant', 'Seymour', 'Seymour', 'type', 'guy', 'who', 'let', 'life', 'pass', 'Forty', 'something', 'still', 'living', 'roommate', 'covet', 'rare', 'records', 'relationship', 'causing', 'be', 'awkward', 'tentative', 'when', 'confronted', 'women.Illeana', 'Douglas', 'also', 'memorable', 'summer', 'school', 'art', 'teacher', 'perfect', 'embodiment', 'artist', 'who', 'struggling', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'could', 'be', 'caricature', 'have', 'seen', 'people', 'real', 'life', 'perfectly.Zwigoff', 'decidedly', 'offbeat', 'sense', 'humor', 'film', 'intelligent', 'thoughtful', 'very', 'funny', 'differences', 'film', 'mainstream', 'studio', 'effort', 'comedy', 'i.e.', 'American', 'Pie', 'Rush', '2', 'comedy', 'natural', 'situations', 'believable', 'situations', 'comedy', 'seem', 'more', 'real', 'more', 'memorable', 'more', 'funny', 'Ghost', 'World', 'great', 'film', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'list', 'best', 'films', 'year']",N/A

Every day we see people blindly following the herd without a second thought.  We see the world around us drained of character, only to be replaced by cardboard, corporate cutouts and endless miles of Starbucks, Home Depots, Borders and strip malls.  Everywhere the lemmings hail this homogenization of American culture as progress.  But for the few that simply cannot will themselves into this state of blissful ignorance, there is ""Ghost World"", a film that chronicles the confusion and frustration that comes with the burden of being an individual.This film offers intelligent and scathing humor both in the sarcastic and biting dialogue of it's characters and in the film's skewering of modern pop culture.  In addition to humor though, ""Ghost World"" also offers the sadness and loneliness of a life lived on the outside of what is considered 'normal' by the masses.  In the end we are presented with doses of both hope and fear. Fear for the amount of willpower it takes to remain an individual in a world that is constantly pressuring everyone to tow the line, and hope that the world is a big place in which to eventually find your niche.  After all, it isn't easy when, as Steve Buscemi's characters says, you ""...can't relate to 99% of humanity.""",5,The subtle art of not fitting in,1060905600,"08 15, 2003",2003,1359,"['Ghost', 'World', 'film', 'struggles', 'who', 'just', 'never', 'feel', 'belong', 'day', 'see', 'people', 'blindly', 'following', 'herd', 'second', 'thought', 'see', 'world', 'drained', 'character', 'only', 'be', 'replaced', 'cardboard', 'corporate', 'cutouts', 'endless', 'miles', 'Starbucks', 'Home', 'Depots', 'Borders', 'strip', 'malls', 'Everywhere', 'lemmings', 'hail', 'homogenization', 'American', 'culture', 'progress', 'few', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'will', 'state', 'blissful', 'ignorance', 'Ghost', 'World', 'film', 'confusion', 'frustration', 'burden', 'being', 'individual.This', 'film', 'offers', 'intelligent', 'scathing', 'humor', 'sarcastic', 'biting', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'film', 'skewering', 'modern', 'pop', 'culture', 'addition', 'humor', 'Ghost', 'World', 'also', 'sadness', 'loneliness', 'life', 'lived', 'outside', 'what', 'considered', ""'normal"", 'masses', 'end', 'are', 'presented', 'doses', 'hope', 'fear', 'Fear', 'amount', 'willpower', 'remain', 'individual', 'world', 'constantly', 'pressuring', 'everyone', 'tow', 'line', 'hope', 'world', 'big', 'place', 'eventually', 'find', 'niche', ""n't"", 'easy', 'when', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'relate', '99', '%', 'humanity']",N/A
681458,A1FA0GBB3S1MWU,B00005T30L,Timothy R Whitelaw,"[15, 18]","Ghost World expounds one of least sugar-coated views of American surburbia the make the screens in recent years. Director Terry Zwiggoff is fascinated by the banal ugliness of strip-mall excess, and Ghost World takes place in a sort of nightmare American neverland - everything's coming up hamburger joints, garage sales, porn shops and hick-town headcases.  The town is never named, but the scnery will be familiar to anyone whose ever stepped outside an American city.Its a perfectly awful backdrop for one of this years sleeper gems, a brave, insightful and refreshingly different take on a fairly tired theme - the coming to terms with reality in late adolescence.  Enid (Thora Birch in an elaboration of her American Beauty role)and Rebbecca are high school grads who just about cope with their existences within Hicksville by berating everything and everyone.  And who can blame them?  This is American culture at it's most facile. Among there objects of fun is Seymour (Steve Buscerni),  an old record collecting greaseball whos lonely hearts ads the girls answer for fun.Its at this point the story begins to diverge somewhat. Enid and Rebbecca begin to drift apart, as Enid isolates herself more, hanging on to her determination not to play any part of such a facile culture, whilst Rebbecca is slowly forced by practicality in to compliance and submission.  Enid becomes fascinated by the pathetic Seymour (&quot;He's the opposite of everything I hate...&quot;) and a poignant relationship develops which becomes the focus of the film.Ghost World was a film whose course was very much charted during its filming - Seymour had originally been intended as only a peripheral character.  But the screen relationship between Birch and Buscerni was so strong as to encourage to director to change the film's emphasis completely.  The result is, by turns, halarious, poignant and its own way, tragic.  Zwigoff is clearly contemporary culture's worst critic and his view of America is as glib, if far more human , than that of Todd Solondz.  And its humanity which gets you here;  despite their flaws,  Zwigoff has genuine compassion for his ensemble of oddballs and its hard not to touched by their plight.The films end is almost epigrammatic in its ambiguity - the Ghost World of the title a sort of dream existence which both Enid and Rebbeca have spent their teenage years floating in, refusing to aknowledge a terrifying reality.  The ending suggests that whilst Rebbecca has left this world far behind, Enid has forever been lost to it.  Its an ending which, like the film, has a perculiar poetry to it.",5,An outcry against banality..........,1008374400,"12 15, 2001",2001,2611,"['Ghost', 'World', 'one', 'least', 'sugar-coated', 'views', 'American', 'surburbia', 'make', 'screens', 'recent', 'years', 'Director', 'Terry', 'Zwiggoff', 'fascinated', 'banal', 'ugliness', 'strip-mall', 'excess', 'Ghost', 'World', 'place', 'sort', 'nightmare', 'American', 'neverland', 'everything', 'coming', 'up', 'hamburger', 'joints', 'garage', 'sales', 'porn', 'shops', 'hick-town', 'headcases', 'town', 'never', 'named', 'scnery', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'anyone', 'ever', 'stepped', 'American', 'city.Its', 'perfectly', 'awful', 'backdrop', 'one', 'years', 'sleeper', 'gems', 'brave', 'insightful', 'refreshingly', 'different', 'take', 'fairly', 'tired', 'theme', 'coming', 'terms', 'reality', 'late', 'adolescence', 'Enid', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'elaboration', 'American', 'Beauty', 'role', 'Rebbecca', 'are', 'high', 'school', 'grads', 'who', 'just', 'cope', 'existences', 'Hicksville', 'berating', 'everything', 'everyone', 'who', 'can', 'blame', 'American', 'culture', 'most', 'facile', 'objects', 'fun', 'Seymour', 'Steve', 'Buscerni', 'old', 'record', 'collecting', 'greaseball', 'whos', 'lonely', 'ads', 'girls', 'answer', 'fun.Its', 'point', 'story', 'diverge', 'somewhat', 'Enid', 'Rebbecca', 'begin', 'drift', 'apart', 'Enid', 'more', 'hanging', 'determination', 'not', 'play', 'part', 'facile', 'culture', 'whilst', 'Rebbecca', 'slowly', 'forced', 'practicality', 'compliance', 'submission', 'Enid', 'becomes', 'fascinated', 'pathetic', 'Seymour', 'quot', 'opposite', 'everything', 'hate', 'quot', 'poignant', 'relationship', 'focus', 'film.Ghost', 'World', 'was', 'film', 'course', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'charted', 'filming', 'Seymour', 'had', 'originally', 'been', 'intended', 'only', 'peripheral', 'character', 'screen', 'relationship', 'Birch', 'Buscerni', 'was', 'so', 'strong', 'encourage', 'director', 'change', 'film', 'emphasis', 'completely', 'result', 'turns', 'halarious', 'poignant', 'own', 'way', 'tragic', 'Zwigoff', 'clearly', 'contemporary', 'culture', 'worst', 'critic', 'view', 'America', 'glib', 'far', 'more', 'human', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'humanity', 'here', 'flaws', 'Zwigoff', 'genuine', 'compassion', 'ensemble', 'oddballs', 'hard', 'not', 'touched', 'plight.The', 'films', 'end', 'almost', 'epigrammatic', 'ambiguity', 'Ghost', 'World', 'title', 'sort', 'dream', 'existence', 'Enid', 'Rebbeca', 'have', 'spent', 'teenage', 'years', 'floating', 'refusing', 'aknowledge', 'terrifying', 'reality', 'ending', 'suggests', 'whilst', 'Rebbecca', 'left', 'world', 'far', 'Enid', 'forever', 'been', 'lost', 'ending', 'film', 'perculiar', 'poetry']",N/A

What I got instead was a movie of intelligence, witticism and ultimately, deep humanity.Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi are excellent as the main characters who live their lives as nonconformist outcasts in a world with little leeway for them.  Their nonconformity isn't the hip variety, it's more a personal inability to accept (or adapt) to the social structure around them.  This is a movie for anyone who has felt themselves an outcast at one time or other.From her disfunctional home life to her interactions with he best friend, Thora Birch is excellent as the  main character.  Her intelligence, alienation and attempt at cynicism at the world around her is well done.  She's finally undone by her own sensitivity and confusion at the end.Buscemi plays an outcast in his late 30's who's special affinity is for old records.  He plays it as if he were born to this role.  We all, I think, know someone like this or have aspects of his personality in our own lives.Terry Zwigoff's direction is excellent.

She's very supportive to Birch, but her work was too provocative that she was not accepted for the scholarship.After graduation, Birch find it hard to maintain her friendship with Johanson, because their interests and ideals are different.

At the time I was sorry, but after seeing it on video, I'm glad I didn't spend the money to see it on the big screen._Ghost World_ is essentially the story of the summer after high school graduation experiences of Enid (Thora Birch), a young woman who spends most of her time keeping a picture journal and complaining about how stupid people are.  Early in the movie she answers a personal ad placed by Blues collector Seymour (Steve Buscemi), pretending to be a woman he once met in an airport.  After she follows him home from this false blind date, the two become friends, after a fashion. Enid makes it her mission to prove to the world that Seymour is not so much of a dork as she first thought by fixing his non-existent love life.Though the performances are quite good, I found it very hard to relate to the characters, who seemed one-dimensional and passionless.  Enid is supposed to be some sort of misunderstood societal misfit, but we know this only because we are told that it is so.  Her actions seem pointless and even cruel, making it hard to sympathise with her.  She suffers a lot and is obviously a quite unhappy person, but her unhappiness is inaccessible.  She hates her stepmother, but we never are shown why.  She is made to attend a summer art class where her work is denigrated as irrelevant, but we never hear her defend herself, or understand what her point of view is.  Mainly, the world is stupid and awful because Enid says it is so, but without hearing her perspective on what she values and what life means to her the message loses its meaning and takes on a tone that is self indulgent and even whiny.Enid's friend, Rebecca, seems mainly to exist to be uncomfortable at Enid's various schemes and to attract attention from men who don't even realise Enid exists.  But Rebecca is also dull and wimpy.  She goes along with things that she disapproves of and keeps hoping that Enid will turn into something that she's obviously not.  The friends' big fight is a let down;  not enough is said and the conflict is too easily resolved.  I would have liked Rebecca to have had more to say for herself, but she just seemed to float through the movie never evincing any real personality.Seymour, the inhibited collector of Blues '78s, is remarkably without feeling, even about his hobby.  He resists Enid's attempts to convince him that he really is an interesting person to the point where we just want to cave in and say, ""Okay, you're dull.""  He becomes involved with a woman who shares none of his interests, but the relationship, if it can be called that, is so much of a tangent to the rest of the action that when he ends it we don't feel anything at all._Ghost World_ offers no sense of progress or change.

It's also the story of the changes in the relationship between Enid and her not-so-odd friend Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson), who after high school, is rapidly transforming into a fairly mainstream adult.The movie has an offbeat sensibility that is both funny and slightly jarring at times, but that delivers a very true-feeling story of post-high school ""what do I do now?"" syndrome. The thing I love about this movie is that, as opposed to the fake silicone slickness of most ""teen"" movies, this has a funny-sad real feel that represents the not often glorified underbelly of society.  The film is populated with entertaining characters, from the pseudo-artistic art teacher (Illeana Douglas), to the bumbling soft-spoken father (Bob Balaban), to cameo characters such as ""Weird Al"" the fifties diner waiter, and Doug, the white-trash mini-mart loiterer.  As Enid says, ""these are our people!""""Ghost World"" is kinder than a John Waters movie, truer than a teen movie, and better than most similarly-true independent movies.",4,"Quirky, and sadly funny.",1013212800,"02 9, 2002",2002,1473,"['have', ""n't"", 'read', 'graphic', 'novel', 'Ghost', 'World', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'preconceived', 'ideas', 'movie', 'saw', 'know', 'Ghost', 'World', 'story', 'slightly', 'odd', 'girl', 'Enid', 'played', 'transparently', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'obsession', 'unloved', 'things', 'world', 'starting', 'encounter', 'Seymour', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'fried-chicken', 'company', 'administrator', 'day', 'geekish', 'collector', '78s', 'other', 'miscellanea', 'night', 'also', 'story', 'changes', 'relationship', 'Enid', 'not-so-odd', 'friend', 'Rebecca', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'who', 'high', 'school', 'rapidly', 'transforming', 'fairly', 'mainstream', 'adult.The', 'movie', 'offbeat', 'sensibility', 'funny', 'slightly', 'jarring', 'times', 'very', 'true-feeling', 'story', 'post-high', 'school', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'now', 'syndrome', 'thing', 'love', 'movie', 'that', 'opposed', 'fake', 'silicone', 'slickness', 'most', 'teen', 'movies', 'funny-sad', 'real', 'feel', 'not', 'often', 'glorified', 'underbelly', 'society', 'film', 'populated', 'entertaining', 'characters', 'pseudo-artistic', 'art', 'teacher', 'Illeana', 'Douglas', 'bumbling', 'soft-spoken', 'father', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'cameo', 'characters', 'such', 'Weird', 'Al', 'fifties', 'diner', 'waiter', 'Doug', 'white-trash', 'mini-mart', 'loiterer', 'Enid', 'are', 'people', 'Ghost', 'World', 'kinder', 'John', 'Waters', 'movie', 'truer', 'teen', 'movie', 'better', 'most', 'similarly-true', 'independent', 'movies']",N/A
