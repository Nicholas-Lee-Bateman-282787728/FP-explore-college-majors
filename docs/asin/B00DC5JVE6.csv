1654785,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B00DC5JVE6,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[1, 2]","In 1983 Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor appeared together on stage for the first and only time in Noel Coward's comedy PRIVATE LIVES.  Although critically panned, it sold out for its entire run on Broadway, with audiences flocking to see the sight of two legendary figures bickering with one another.  William Ivory's screenplay tells the story of that theatrical performance, focusing in particular on Taylor's (Helena Bonham Carter's) gradually disintegrating state of mind, as she realizes that Burton (Dominic West) has abandoned her for good in favor of his new wife Sally Burton (Cassie Raine).  Bonham Carter gives a creditable impersonation of Taylor, even though she lacks that mysterious quality that kept Taylor in the public eye for so many years; in this performance, Taylor comes across as a bit of a hopeless drunk with a penchant for upstaging Burton.  West's Burton seems like a dedicated actor; despite his love of money and the Hollywood high life, he never lost his professionalism, even in an obvious turkey like this PRIVATE LIVES, in which Taylor seldom knew her lines and often consciously departed from the script, in full knowledge that the audience didn't give a fig.  So long as she appeared on stage, then the houses would remain packed; if she was absent, the box-office suffered as a result.  In the end, however, both of them seem rather pathetic figures, mere shadows of their former selves at the height of their popularity during the mid-Sixties.  We can't help feeling sorry for two actors who were so fond of the limelight that they never knew when to give up: Burton kept wanting to play King Lear, even though he was both physically and mentally ill-equipped to do so.  BURTON AND TAYLOR seems like a requiem for two great stars reduced to mere museum exhibits.",3,Routine Trot Through the (Private) Lives of Two Legendary Personalities,1400630400,"05 21, 2014",2014,1804,"['1983', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'appeared', 'together', 'stage', 'first', 'only', 'time', 'Noel', 'Coward', 'comedy', 'PRIVATE', 'LIVES', 'critically', 'panned', 'sold', 'out', 'entire', 'run', 'Broadway', 'audiences', 'flocking', 'see', 'sight', 'two', 'legendary', 'figures', 'bickering', 'one', 'William', 'Ivory', 'screenplay', 'story', 'theatrical', 'performance', 'focusing', 'particular', 'Taylor', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'gradually', 'disintegrating', 'state', 'mind', 'Burton', 'Dominic', 'West', 'abandoned', 'good', 'favor', 'new', 'wife', 'Sally', 'Burton', 'Cassie', 'Raine', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'creditable', 'impersonation', 'Taylor', 'even', 'mysterious', 'quality', 'kept', 'Taylor', 'public', 'eye', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'performance', 'Taylor', 'across', 'bit', 'hopeless', 'drunk', 'penchant', 'upstaging', 'Burton', 'West', 'Burton', 'dedicated', 'actor', 'love', 'money', 'Hollywood', 'high', 'life', 'never', 'lost', 'professionalism', 'even', 'obvious', 'turkey', 'PRIVATE', 'LIVES', 'Taylor', 'seldom', 'knew', 'lines', 'often', 'consciously', 'departed', 'script', 'full', 'knowledge', 'audience', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'fig', 'So', 'long', 'appeared', 'stage', 'then', 'houses', 'would', 'remain', 'packed', 'was', 'absent', 'box-office', 'suffered', 'result', 'end', 'however', 'seem', 'rather', 'pathetic', 'figures', 'mere', 'shadows', 'former', 'selves', 'height', 'popularity', 'mid-Sixties', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'two', 'actors', 'who', 'were', 'so', 'fond', 'limelight', 'never', 'knew', 'when', 'give', 'up', 'Burton', 'kept', 'wanting', 'play', 'King', 'Lear', 'even', 'was', 'physically', 'mentally', 'ill-equipped', 'do', 'so', 'BURTON', 'AND', 'TAYLOR', 'requiem', 'two', 'great', 'stars', 'reduced', 'mere', 'museum', 'exhibits']",Burton & Taylor (DVD)
1654786,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00DC5JVE6,Grady Harp,"[17, 17]","The DVD of this BBC film for television is yet to be released in the US so the first introduction to what is actually a very fine film was presented to the American audience in piece meal fashion on the BBC network: 7 minutes of story then 4 minutes of commercials then 7 more minutes of story, etc - for 2 hours. It grows wearisome to see two character studies so well sculpted cut up into a puzzle by commercialism's greed. The uninterrupted DVD should correct that flaw and will likely be a stunning experience. Richard Laxton directs a screenplay by William Ivory (no, not THAT Ivory family...), but the kudos for the success of this film go to Helena Bonham Carter and Dominic West who manage to reincarnate Li and Dick with consummate skill.Elizabeth Taylor (Helena Bonham Carter) invites her ex-husband - twice married, twice divorced in one of the last century's most tempestuous and media focused couplings - Richard Burton (Dominic West) to her fiftieth birthday party where, as a recovering alcoholic, he refuses to get drunk with her. She obviously still retains her obsession and passion for him and suggests that they star in a stage revival of Nol Coward's play Private Lives that Liz is to produce. The agreement and announcement causes gossip with the press who speculate a possible romantic reconciliation. With a new girlfriend and the prospect of playing King Lear, Burton is not happy with the project, especially with Taylor's pill-popping and her lack of stage experience, which causes problems at rehearsals: Taylor has not even read the play before day 1 of the rehearsals. The play opens to a critical trashing but is extremely popular with audiences because they want to see Liz Taylor and, when she is ill, numbers dwindle and the show is put on hold. After a two-month run, with a projected tour, the curtain comes down and Taylor tells Burton she has always loved him and still does. Richard and Elizabeth go their separate ways, but they did sort out their differences and remain friends, and apparently they only communicated by telephone and letter, until his death in 1984. Taylor died in 2011.The supporting cast, especially Lenora Crichlow as Liz' dresser Chen Sam and Stanley Townsend as the play's director Milton Katselas, is strong for the small amount of time they are on screen. The spectacle is the obsessive relationship between two very strong characters and fortunately both actors give excellent impersonations and recreations. We are allowed to see and understand their differences and frustrations.

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[2, 2]","BURTON AND TAYLOR  surprised me.Truthfully, I wasn&#8217;t expecting this TV movie from BBC Home Entertainment to be very good, since few films about show business figures are, but this one was quite moving and insightful.The film is set in the 1980s, after legendary stars Elizabeth Taylor (Helena Bonham Carter) and Richard Burton (Dominic West) have divorced each other for the second time.  Both are alcoholics, though Burton is sincerely attempting to stay &#8220;on the wagon&#8221;.Elizabeth decides to co-produce a limited run (10 weeks) production of Noel Coward&#8217;s classic comedy, PRIVATE LIVES, on Broadway to co-star her and Richard.  He agrees, in part, because the run will result in a terrific payday and, since he continues to live like &#8220;royalty,&#8221; he can probably use the money.  Also, though both he and Elizabeth are currently romantically involved with others, they still have a strong, albeit unhealthy, attraction toward each other.Working together in the theatre is a near disaster for the duo.  Richard, the consummate professional, is appalled by his former wife&#8217;s lack of professionalism.  Indeed, she had never even read PRIVATE LIVES prior to the first rehearsal.  Sparks do fly, as Elizabeth tries to woo Richard back into her private life.Though they really look nothing like the icons they are portraying both actors brilliantly capture the essence of the two stars, delivering impeccable performances.  The screenplay by William Ivory and Richard Laxton&#8217;s direction are first-rate.The DVD from BBC Home Entertainment contains two &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; featurettes. Michael B.
