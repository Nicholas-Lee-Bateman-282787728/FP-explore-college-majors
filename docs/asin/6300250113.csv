And while maybe that's not done as effectively as, say ""The Godfather"", it is done well. Rosanna Arquette plays a snobbish high priced call girl is in her most fetching role, one up from ""Desperately Seeking Susan"". Andy Garcia makes a name for himself as an arrogant, smug coke dealer, and Jeff Bridges plays an alcoholic cop quite well. The story culminates in the only way it could given the nature of the lead characters, who define the decadence of the 80s. I never understood the panning of this movie, though many of the critics I respect the most have done just that. This is one of my favorites, certainly from the 80s, which was full of sleepers that garnered more followings after being released on cable. The surrounding character actors accentuate the flavor of the 80s this story takes place in- the rolled up sleeves on the sport coats, the early generation car phones, the fashions, the jargon. Garcia, Arquette and Bridges are all fabulous and alone are reasons worth watching this movie, despite any poor reviews. Maybe i don't know any better, but I loved this movie. Correct me if I'm wrong, even movies like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" were received poorly upon initial release, not to put the 2 flicks in the same league.

229104,A2IY9M330NKBW6,6300250113,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 1]","I totally had forgotten about this flick. It re-entered my radar, and seeing how Jeff Bridges has a knack for picking good projects, I thought I'd take a look. Glad I did.Here's the scoop. Jeff Bridges plays Matt Scudder. He's an ex-cop who now does P.I. type work. He's divorced and on the wagon. He gets an odd invitation to a party where a girl treats him as though she's known him for years. He also knows the host as an ex-con. Andy Garcia is also present. He's got to be dirty. And Rosanna Arquette is also present as an erstwhile hostess. So why is he here? The girl who feigns knowing him is in fear for her life. She needs his protection. How will all this play out?The director, Hal Ashby, had a short, but notable career. Most of films are worth seeing and this is no exception. It's a plainly shot, gritty crime thriller. There is no fancy camera work but the shots are framed well. There is a lot of natural lighting used. That, along with the fact some of the dialogue seems extemporaneous, puts the viewer closer to the action. Bridges is his usual good self. He has some cliche-ish sides to his character, but doesn't play them that way. Yes. Ex-cop. Boozer. Divorced. But he doesn't rub people the wrong way. He still seems on good terms with his ex-cop friends. They even collaborate with him on the final sting. His apartment isn't a dive and, though he might not make a lot of money, he maintains himself. The story is generally good although the relationship between him and Arquette needed more time to percolate. Andy Garcia does a good job as the classy, yet sleazy, bad guy. He might have an appreciation for the architecture of Gaudi, but he's a killer though and through. The final confrontation between him and Bridges is directed well.This is not a great movie but it's a good watch. As crime thrillers go, this is in the upper tiers.",4,Digging Up Old Treasures,1366243200,"04 18, 2013",2013,1863,"['totally', 'had', 'forgotten', 'flick', 're-entered', 'radar', 'seeing', 'how', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'knack', 'picking', 'good', 'projects', 'thought', ""'d"", 'take', 'look', 'Glad', 'did.Here', 'scoop', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Matt', 'Scudder', 'ex-cop', 'who', 'now', 'P.I', 'type', 'work', 'divorced', 'wagon', 'odd', 'invitation', 'party', 'where', 'girl', 'known', 'years', 'also', 'host', 'ex-con', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'also', 'present', 'got', 'be', 'dirty', 'Rosanna', 'Arquette', 'also', 'present', 'erstwhile', 'hostess', 'So', 'why', 'here', 'girl', 'who', 'knowing', 'fear', 'life', 'protection', 'How', 'will', 'all', 'play', 'out', 'director', 'Hal', 'Ashby', 'had', 'short', 'notable', 'career', 'Most', 'films', 'are', 'worth', 'seeing', 'exception', 'plainly', 'shot', 'gritty', 'crime', 'thriller', 'fancy', 'camera', 'work', 'shots', 'are', 'framed', 'well', 'lot', 'natural', 'lighting', 'used', 'fact', 'dialogue', 'extemporaneous', 'viewer', 'closer', 'action', 'Bridges', 'usual', 'good', 'self', 'cliche-ish', 'sides', 'character', ""n't"", 'play', 'way', 'Yes', 'Ex-cop', 'Boozer', 'Divorced', ""n't"", 'rub', 'people', 'wrong', 'way', 'still', 'good', 'terms', 'ex-cop', 'friends', 'even', 'collaborate', 'final', 'sting', 'apartment', ""n't"", 'dive', 'might', 'not', 'make', 'lot', 'money', 'story', 'generally', 'good', 'relationship', 'Arquette', 'needed', 'more', 'time', 'percolate', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'good', 'job', 'classy', 'yet', 'sleazy', 'bad', 'guy', 'might', 'have', 'appreciation', 'architecture', 'Gaudi', 'killer', 'though', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Bridges', 'directed', 'well.This', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'good', 'watch', 'crime', 'thrillers', 'go', 'upper', 'tiers']",N/A

Things in his life dont get any better when he meets a prostitute called Sunny(Alexandra Paul). Sunny ends up getting murdered and Matthew tries to solve the murder.Sure the character development is scant and some of the lines in this movie are howlers(like Sunny exclaiming which part of her anatomy glows in the dark) but the movie is not bad. Jeff Bridges shines as Matthew Scudder and Andy Garcia plays the scummy character of Angel Moldonado well. Rosanna Arquette is pretty good also as the smarmy and snobbish Sarah. These are the performances that keep the movie afloat.Its kind of sad that this underrated drama never got a DVD release. Its like depriving people of seeing a movie that deserves a look of seeing it while shoving crappy films(like anything from Seltzer and Freidberg) down their throats.
