This is one of the three shows that I really liked a lot. I do like the Invisible Man and the overall concept of his character, but I'm not really a big fan of the older shows and movies all that much. This show however is superb in many ways. It came out in 2000, (the same year that the 1933 Invisible Man remake Hollow Man was released) and I thought this series was the best of the two. As I said before in my Hollow Man 2 movie review, I think and always will think that the first Hollow Man film is a big failure and that the sequel is a lot better in my opinion and how it's one of those rare sequels that surpasses the first film. This to me is the real new generation Invisible Man remake. It ran for two seasons which spawned 46 episodes. Vincent Ventresca in my opinion was an excellent choice for the Invisible Man. The rest of the cast was also good for their roles. The special effects of the Invisible Man and in general are outstanding and very realistic, even for a Sci-Fi feature. The direction was taken in a whole new way when it came to the character going invisible. He's an ex con/thief who was getting life in prison and in short, he made a deal with government agents and scientist who came up with a synthetic gland that they call Quick Silver and implanted it in his cerebral cortex. With that happening, he has the ability to turn invisible and and visible at his mental command. He can also turn objects invisible to. He becomes a Federal Agent to fight against evil doers. He also has to take a shot of meds every week to help him not go insane from the gland. The shows are suspenseful, action packed, and funny at certain points. I'm glad they brought these out for home release and am happy to have got them. This is an excellent series for any action movie fan and Invisible Man character fan. This series and Hollow Man 2 are the ONLY Invisible Man film portrayals I like currently. Always had and always will. Don't care too much about the other portrayals, especially the first Hollow Man. Vincent Ventresca and Christian Slater in my opinion are my only favorite Invisible Man actors of all time. This is a much better remake of the old 1933 film in my opinion.",5,One of the best depictions of the Invisible Man and a great series.,1298246400,"02 21, 2011",2011,2339,"[""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'watching', 't.v.', 'literally', 'only', 'three', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'anymore', 'Other', 'only', 'watch', 'movies', 'one', 'three', 'shows', 'really', 'liked', 'lot', 'do', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'overall', 'concept', 'character', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'big', 'fan', 'older', 'shows', 'movies', 'that', 'much', 'show', 'however', 'superb', 'many', 'ways', 'came', 'out', '2000', 'same', 'year', '1933', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'remake', 'Hollow', 'Man', 'was', 'released', 'thought', 'series', 'was', 'best', 'two', 'said', 'Hollow', 'Man', '2', 'movie', 'review', 'think', 'always', 'will', 'think', 'first', 'Hollow', 'Man', 'film', 'big', 'failure', 'sequel', 'lot', 'better', 'opinion', 'how', 'one', 'rare', 'sequels', 'first', 'film', 'real', 'new', 'generation', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'remake', 'ran', 'two', 'seasons', 'spawned', '46', 'episodes', 'Vincent', 'Ventresca', 'opinion', 'was', 'excellent', 'choice', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'roles', 'special', 'effects', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'general', 'are', 'outstanding', 'very', 'realistic', 'even', 'Sci-Fi', 'feature', 'direction', 'was', 'taken', 'whole', 'new', 'way', 'when', 'came', 'character', 'going', 'invisible', 'ex', 'con/thief', 'who', 'was', 'getting', 'life', 'prison', 'short', 'made', 'deal', 'government', 'agents', 'scientist', 'who', 'came', 'up', 'synthetic', 'gland', 'call', 'Quick', 'Silver', 'implanted', 'cerebral', 'cortex', 'happening', 'ability', 'turn', 'invisible', 'visible', 'mental', 'command', 'can', 'also', 'turn', 'objects', 'invisible', 'Federal', 'Agent', 'fight', 'evil', 'doers', 'also', 'take', 'shot', 'meds', 'week', 'help', 'not', 'go', 'insane', 'gland', 'shows', 'are', 'suspenseful', 'action', 'packed', 'funny', 'certain', 'points', ""'m"", 'glad', 'brought', 'out', 'home', 'release', 'am', 'happy', 'have', 'got', 'excellent', 'series', 'action', 'movie', 'fan', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'character', 'fan', 'series', 'Hollow', 'Man', '2', 'are', 'ONLY', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'film', 'portrayals', 'like', 'currently', 'Always', 'had', 'always', 'will', 'Do', ""n't"", 'care', 'too', 'much', 'other', 'portrayals', 'especially', 'first', 'Hollow', 'Man', 'Vincent', 'Ventresca', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'opinion', 'are', 'only', 'favorite', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'actors', 'time', 'much', 'better', 'remake', 'old', '1933', 'film', 'opinion']",N/A

1112883,A8RIVWC35B4RA,B000X1N1VQ,"G. Kukis ""Loserboy""","[2, 3]","I was quite disappointed in this series.  However, I am not a big fan of science fiction.  If the dialogue is good, the characters are well drawn, and the plotting is reasonable, then I can certainly accept the sci-fi aspect of it.  I loved Buffy the Vampire Slayer and enjoyed Firefly (despite the goofy combination of guns and space ships).In the Invisible Man, I don't find the characters to be interesting or compelling, apart from the babe in the lab.  I am a sucker of a cute nerd, I guess.I never buy into the lead character's motivation, his back-story, or his rebelliousness.  He simply doesn't sell it for me.  His boss is okay, but so much of it strikes me as corny.The plotting and the writing strike me as being weak as well.  I am about 8 episodes into the first season, and I don't know if I really want to finish this series or just put it back on the shelf.  I don't find myself wondering where this next episode will take the characters, or what new layers of back story will be added to them.  If I am tired and it is mid-episode, I shut it down.  I don't get interested enough to stay up late to see what happens next.Obviously, I am in a minority here and there seem to be a number of people who really like this series.  Maybe if I was 16, had not seen many well-crafted series, this might have a great appeal to me.  But, at my age, it just doesn't float my boat.If you are a parent thinking about this for your kid, it is fairly clean with not a lot of innuendo (so far) and very little swearing (except one episode where one character uses God's name in vain, when it was unnecessary).  However, for the most part, as far as I have gone in the series, there is very little swearing, which I believe is a plus.",3,"If you are a sci-fi buff, you might like this.",1354233600,"11 30, 2012",2012,1734,"['was', 'quite', 'disappointed', 'series', 'However', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'science', 'fiction', 'dialogue', 'good', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'drawn', 'plotting', 'reasonable', 'then', 'can', 'certainly', 'accept', 'sci-fi', 'aspect', 'loved', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'enjoyed', 'Firefly', 'goofy', 'combination', 'guns', 'space', 'ships', '.In', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'characters', 'be', 'interesting', 'compelling', 'apart', 'babe', 'lab', 'am', 'sucker', 'cute', 'nerd', 'guess.I', 'never', 'buy', 'lead', 'character', 'motivation', 'back-story', 'rebelliousness', 'simply', ""n't"", 'sell', 'boss', 'okay', 'so', 'much', 'corny.The', 'plotting', 'writing', 'strike', 'being', 'weak', 'as', 'well', 'am', '8', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'really', 'want', 'finish', 'series', 'just', 'put', 'back', 'shelf', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'wondering', 'where', 'next', 'episode', 'will', 'take', 'characters', 'what', 'new', 'layers', 'back', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'added', 'am', 'tired', 'mid-episode', 'shut', 'down', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'interested', 'enough', 'stay', 'up', 'late', 'see', 'what', 'next.Obviously', 'am', 'minority', 'here', 'there', 'seem', 'be', 'number', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'series', 'Maybe', 'was', '16', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'many', 'well-crafted', 'series', 'might', 'have', 'great', 'appeal', 'age', 'just', ""n't"", 'float', 'boat.If', 'are', 'parent', 'thinking', 'kid', 'fairly', 'clean', 'not', 'lot', 'innuendo', 'so', 'far', 'very', 'little', 'swearing', 'one', 'episode', 'where', 'one', 'character', 'God', 'name', 'vain', 'when', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'However', 'most', 'part', 'as', 'far', 'have', 'gone', 'series', 'very', 'little', 'swearing', 'believe', 'plus']",N/A

1112886,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B000X1N1VQ,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[81, 89]","After seeing so many poor or banal sci-fi series released on DVD, I was upset that the Sci-Fi Channel's THE INVISIBLE MAN series was not amongst them (at least not in the US anyway... it's been available for years on Region 2 DVD's), but now, at long last, it's coming! This is by far the best show that the Sci-Fi Channel has ever created (aside from the great BATTLESTAR GALACTICA) and it has been deserving of reruns at the VERY least, but other less interesting and less entertaining shows have been clogging up Sci-Fi's airwaves (STARGATE series, I'm looking at you!).But onto the show itself. Darien Fawkes (the underappreciated Vincent Ventresca) is a thief who is finally caught and put in prison. He's looking at a life sentence, but his brother comes to his ""rescue"" of sorts when he offers him a deal: Testing an experimental gland implant in the brain that will release a chemical nicknamed ""Quicksilver"" that coats the skin for a brief period of time that bends light around the subject, allowing them to become invisible to the naked eye. Darien accepts the deal, but we know what road good intentions lead to. Fawkes' brother is double-crossed and killed by his assistant Arnaud DeFehrn (the wonderfully sleazy Joel Bissonette), and Fawkes is stuck with the experimental gland before it's perfected. The gland has a potentially fatal flaw which is that if used for too long of a period of time, the user (in this case, Fawkes) will experience what is called ""Quicksilver Madness"" which he experiences psychotic and sociopathic tendencies. Fawkes is recruited by ""The Agency"", a covert ops organization that answers only to The President, run by a perenially frustrated bean-counter usually referred to as ""The Official"" or ""The Fat Man"" (the hilarious Eddie Jones) and his yes-man Eberts (the also-hilarious Michael McCafferty). Fawkes' condition is watched over by the lovely Claire ""The Keeper"" Keeply (beautiful and dry-witted Shannon Kenny), who must regularly give him injections of a counter-agent that wards off the Quicksilver Madness, and is determined to find a way to remove the gland from Darien without the procedure killing him.The show also gives us a brilliant buddy cop story with Fawkes partnered with Agent Bobby Hobbes (the wonderful and easily recognizable Paul Ben-Victor), a self-professed ladies man and martial arts master, who also may be suffering from schizophrenia that may be fueling these delusions of grandeur (or are they delusions?). The chemistry that is developed between Fawkes and Hobbes is just amazing, and it becomes one of the high points of the show.One of the other high points is the amazing special effects. When Fawkes goes invisible (and vice versa), the transition is totally seamless. It was this level of achievement that unfortunately brought this show to an all-too premature end because it was just too expensive to keep up that level.Overall, this is a really great and really fun show that just ended way too soon but it finally is back to watch on this DVD series!",5,FINALLY!!!,1199664000,"01 7, 2008",2008,3036,"['seeing', 'so', 'many', 'poor', 'banal', 'sci-fi', 'series', 'released', 'DVD', 'was', 'upset', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'THE', 'INVISIBLE', 'MAN', 'series', 'was', 'not', 'amongst', 'least', 'not', 'US', 'anyway', 'been', 'available', 'years', 'Region', '2', 'DVD', 'now', 'long', 'last', 'coming', 'far', 'best', 'show', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'ever', 'created', 'aside', 'great', 'BATTLESTAR', 'GALACTICA', 'been', 'deserving', 'reruns', 'VERY', 'least', 'other', 'less', 'interesting', 'less', 'entertaining', 'shows', 'have', 'been', 'clogging', 'up', 'Sci-Fi', 'airwaves', 'STARGATE', 'series', ""'m"", 'looking', '.But', 'show', 'Darien', 'Fawkes', 'underappreciated', 'Vincent', 'Ventresca', 'thief', 'who', 'finally', 'caught', 'put', 'prison', 'looking', 'life', 'sentence', 'brother', 'rescue', 'sorts', 'when', 'deal', 'Testing', 'experimental', 'gland', 'implant', 'brain', 'will', 'release', 'chemical', 'nicknamed', 'Quicksilver', 'skin', 'brief', 'period', 'time', 'light', 'subject', 'allowing', 'become', 'invisible', 'naked', 'eye', 'Darien', 'deal', 'know', 'what', 'road', 'good', 'intentions', 'lead', 'Fawkes', 'brother', 'double-crossed', 'killed', 'assistant', 'Arnaud', 'DeFehrn', 'wonderfully', 'sleazy', 'Joel', 'Bissonette', 'Fawkes', 'stuck', 'experimental', 'gland', 'perfected', 'gland', 'potentially', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'used', 'too', 'long', 'period', 'time', 'user', 'case', 'Fawkes', 'will', 'experience', 'what', 'called', 'Quicksilver', 'Madness', 'psychotic', 'sociopathic', 'tendencies', 'Fawkes', 'recruited', 'Agency', 'covert', 'ops', 'organization', 'only', 'President', 'run', 'perenially', 'frustrated', 'bean-counter', 'usually', 'referred', 'Official', 'Fat', 'Man', 'hilarious', 'Eddie', 'Jones', 'yes-man', 'Eberts', 'also-hilarious', 'Michael', 'McCafferty', 'Fawkes', 'condition', 'watched', 'lovely', 'Claire', 'Keeper', 'Keeply', 'beautiful', 'dry-witted', 'Shannon', 'Kenny', 'who', 'must', 'regularly', 'give', 'injections', 'counter-agent', 'Quicksilver', 'Madness', 'determined', 'find', 'way', 'remove', 'gland', 'Darien', 'procedure', 'killing', 'him.The', 'show', 'also', 'brilliant', 'buddy', 'cop', 'story', 'Fawkes', 'partnered', 'Agent', 'Bobby', 'Hobbes', 'wonderful', 'easily', 'recognizable', 'Paul', 'Ben-Victor', 'self-professed', 'ladies', 'man', 'martial', 'arts', 'master', 'who', 'also', 'may', 'be', 'suffering', 'schizophrenia', 'may', 'be', 'fueling', 'delusions', 'grandeur', 'are', 'delusions', 'chemistry', 'developed', 'Fawkes', 'Hobbes', 'just', 'amazing', 'one', 'high', 'points', 'show.One', 'other', 'high', 'points', 'amazing', 'special', 'effects', 'When', 'Fawkes', 'invisible', 'vice', 'versa', 'transition', 'totally', 'seamless', 'was', 'level', 'achievement', 'unfortunately', 'brought', 'show', 'all-too', 'premature', 'end', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'expensive', 'keep', 'up', 'level.Overall', 'really', 'great', 'really', 'fun', 'show', 'just', 'ended', 'way', 'too', 'soon', 'finally', 'back', 'watch', 'DVD', 'series']",N/A

Darien just wants the gland out of his head but due to the meddling of the mole he suffers from a condition called Quicksilver Madness something the mole designed into the gland to insure whoever recieved the gland would be dependent on a counter agent which prevents the madness. The only way to remove the gland that is known will kill Darien so he works for the agency partnered with a deranged but lovable partner in Bobby Hobbs (sp?) Paul Ben-Victor's character and watched over by the Keeper, the Official and the hapless Eberts, the ultimate yes man.Awesome show and great DVD set considering how long its been in the making and the considerable struggle to get it to market.

Arguably the best, original show to ever grace the network, The Invisible Man stars Vincent Ventresca as Darien Fawkes, a con-man and thief that undergoes an experiment upon getting captured and put in jail.  The experiment involves a gland imprint in his brain that allows Fawkes to turn himself invisible, and after his agent brother is murdered and betrayed, Fawkes sets out to avenge his death, and battles assassins and other enemies in the process.  He gets teamed with Agent Hobbes (Paul Ben-Victor), which provides some of the best moments of the series, which is frequently entertaining and even surprisingly innovative for its time.  For a Sci-Fi Channel series, The Invisible Man also features some nifty effects work, and the underrated and underutilized Ventresca is wonderful and magnetic as Fawkes.

I watched this show every week when it was part of Sci Fi Prime on the Sci Fi Channel.  This was one of those rare periods when they were producing and airing a decent line-up.  The lead actor was great fun and quite endearing, and the supporting cast was just right for the action/humor combo nature of the show.  Not that this was a comedic series or anything.  The lead was wise cracking and he and his buddy-agent had their differences, and it worked.  This show even had a fair amount of heart.  Take the worst of what Sci Fi Channel has thrown at us on the cheap every Friday and Saturday night during their worst cycles, and this is the antithesis of that.  This is the type of show Sci Fi should still be producing instead of that really lame Flash Gordon rip or 99%-100% of their Saturday night movies.  Since they will continue to toss the cheapest crap they can come up with at us Friday and Saturday nights, maybe watching reruns of this in your DVD player will hold you over until they stumble on the next Battlestar Galactica by the same sheer, blind luck that ever brought us Farscape or SG1.

I can hardly believe it's been 6 years since I've watched this show on the Sci-Fi Channel. I'm so glad there's no more waiting!Oh, you haven't been introduced? Well, let me take you into a world where nothing is as it seems, and you'll meet a man so transparent, you can see right through him.Darien Fawkes, a two-bit hood who tries to do good on his latest job, gets thrown into jail for the longest stretch possible: life imprisonment.Darien's brother Kevin decides to help out, and gets Darien paroled into his own little science project. It's quite simple, really...Kevin operates on Darien and implants a gland into his brain that delivers a substance called Quicksilver. This substance has a unique benefit - it turns its host completely invisible.But this kind of power can't come without a catch, right?Well, it turns out that Kevin's little gift has an unforeseen side effect on Darien. After prolonged use of the gland, it causes him to become a murderous psychopath, a condition called 'Quicksilver Madness', which can only be suppressed with a counteragent injection.Over the course of this first season boxed set, we get to watch the adventures of an unlikely cop-buddy comedy/sci-fi team up between Darien Fawkes, the man with the Gland, and his partner Bobby Hobbes, who can't even get a prepaid calling card from their boss, a man only known as ""The Official"". You'll watch their adventures of taking out spy networks, disabling assassins, uncovering Agency experiments that went horribly awry, and much more.It's all in a day's work for - The Department of Fish & Game?!?!?Okay, so that's the recap of the first season...now let's tackle the DVD treatment itself.I had to give this one 4 stars because the special features fell short of my expectations. The sit-down with series creator Matt Greenberg provides some insight into how he conceived the show, but at only 10 minutes long, this left me with more questions than answers. The bonus episode of ""Legends"" from season two was a nice touch - it's like our own little shot of counteragent to offset the Madness of waiting until season two becomes available. I also expected commentaries on more than just the pilot episode. Why doesn't the commentary track have input from Paul Ben-Victor? That's like having a Dukes of Hazzard commentary without Tom Wopat.I'm hoping that when the next season comes out it'll have features like how the Quicksilver special effects were done, or the TV ads that aired for the show, bloopers, anything to make up for the lack of features here.You'd better order this, before all the available copies Quicksilver away before your very eyes!",4,"""A Nobel Prize winning smart-a** named George Bernard Shaw once said...""",1206748800,"03 29, 2008",2008,2756,"[""n't"", 'quote', 'start', 'off', 'episode', 'ofCriminal', 'Minds', 'First', 'Season', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'can', 'hardly', 'believe', 'been', '6', 'years', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'show', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'more', 'waiting', 'Oh', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'introduced', 'Well', 'let', 'take', 'world', 'where', 'nothing', ""'ll"", 'meet', 'man', 'so', 'transparent', 'can', 'see', 'right', 'him.Darien', 'Fawkes', 'two-bit', 'hood', 'who', 'do', 'good', 'latest', 'job', 'thrown', 'jail', 'longest', 'stretch', 'possible', 'life', 'imprisonment.Darien', 'brother', 'Kevin', 'help', 'out', 'Darien', 'paroled', 'own', 'little', 'science', 'project', 'quite', 'simple', 'really', 'Kevin', 'Darien', 'gland', 'brain', 'substance', 'called', 'Quicksilver', 'substance', 'unique', 'benefit', 'host', 'completely', 'kind', 'power', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'catch', 'right', 'Well', 'out', 'Kevin', 'little', 'gift', 'unforeseen', 'side', 'effect', 'Darien', 'prolonged', 'use', 'gland', 'become', 'murderous', 'psychopath', 'condition', 'called', ""'Quicksilver"", 'Madness', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'suppressed', 'counteragent', 'course', 'first', 'season', 'boxed', 'set', 'get', 'watch', 'adventures', 'unlikely', 'cop-buddy', 'comedy/sci-fi', 'team', 'up', 'Darien', 'Fawkes', 'man', 'Gland', 'partner', 'Bobby', 'Hobbes', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'prepaid', 'calling', 'card', 'boss', 'man', 'only', 'known', 'Official', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'adventures', 'taking', 'out', 'spy', 'networks', 'disabling', 'assassins', 'uncovering', 'Agency', 'experiments', 'went', 'horribly', 'awry', 'much', 'more.It', 'day', 'work', 'Department', 'Fish', 'Game', 'Okay', 'recap', 'first', 'season', 'now', 'let', 'tackle', 'DVD', 'treatment', 'itself.I', 'had', 'give', 'one', '4', 'stars', 'special', 'features', 'fell', 'short', 'expectations', 'sit-down', 'series', 'creator', 'Matt', 'Greenberg', 'insight', 'how', 'conceived', 'show', 'only', '10', 'minutes', 'long', 'left', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'bonus', 'episode', 'Legends', 'season', 'two', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'own', 'little', 'shot', 'counteragent', 'offset', 'Madness', 'waiting', 'season', 'two', 'becomes', 'available', 'also', 'expected', 'commentaries', 'more', 'just', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Why', ""n't"", 'commentary', 'track', 'have', 'input', 'Paul', 'Ben-Victor', 'having', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'commentary', 'Tom', 'Wopat.I', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'when', 'next', 'season', 'out', ""'ll"", 'have', 'features', 'how', 'Quicksilver', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'done', 'TV', 'ads', 'aired', 'show', 'bloopers', 'anything', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'features', 'here.You', ""'d"", 'better', 'order', 'available', 'copies', 'Quicksilver', 'away', 'very', 'eyes']",N/A

History shows that he was the latter, so the concept of being 'invisible' being rooted in science and psychology can create an amazing series.  Just think of Sue Storm (Invisible Woman).  Other than the sexist moments that could be envisioned, it opens so many doors to incredible fiction.This Universal release is excellent.  The First Season is so far superior to most of the series out there that the MSRP is justified.  Special effects are expensive, and unfortunately, like so many series before SFX make and break them.Darien Fawkes is a lifetime thief.  Caught once too often, he is jailed for the long haul until his brother, Kevin has a conditional release dependant on his co-operation in a scientific experiment. Implanting technology into Dariens' brain, Kevin creates an 'invisible' man whom is dependant on Quicksilver.  Unfortunately Quicksilver madness overtakes him when the dosage is waning with terrible side effects.  His brother is killed by outside forces, and leaves Darien to deal with his power on his own.That's where the fun begins. The 23 episodes on this set include some spectacular scenarios.  Darien is assigned to protect a witness in ""Raplph"", a phony spiritualist is uncovered with great danger (Tiresias), another invisible man comes to visit in ""It Hurts When You Do This"", and the Chinese government is thwarted in ""Cat and Mouse"".The 'Fly on the wall' scenario can be very powerful indeed.Vincent Ventresca plays Darien, the con man/invisible man and Shannon Kenny plays his new 'boss' with great applomb.Look for this if you can at your local video store.Invisibly yours.Tim Lasiuta",4,Hardly Invisible,1206316800,"03 24, 2008",2008,1685,"['invisible', 'Man', 'H', 'G', 'Wells', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'mad', 'genius', 'History', 'was', 'latter', 'concept', 'being', ""'invisible"", 'being', 'rooted', 'science', 'psychology', 'can', 'create', 'amazing', 'series', 'Just', 'think', 'Sue', 'Storm', 'Invisible', 'Woman', 'Other', 'sexist', 'moments', 'could', 'be', 'envisioned', 'so', 'many', 'doors', 'incredible', 'fiction.This', 'Universal', 'release', 'excellent', 'First', 'Season', 'so', 'far', 'superior', 'most', 'series', 'there', 'MSRP', 'justified', 'Special', 'effects', 'are', 'expensive', 'unfortunately', 'so', 'many', 'series', 'SFX', 'make', 'break', 'them.Darien', 'Fawkes', 'lifetime', 'thief', 'Caught', 'once', 'too', 'often', 'jailed', 'long', 'haul', 'brother', 'Kevin', 'conditional', 'release', 'dependant', 'co-operation', 'scientific', 'experiment', 'Implanting', 'technology', 'Dariens', 'brain', 'Kevin', ""'invisible"", 'man', 'whom', 'dependant', 'Quicksilver', 'Unfortunately', 'Quicksilver', 'madness', 'overtakes', 'when', 'dosage', 'waning', 'terrible', 'side', 'effects', 'brother', 'killed', 'outside', 'forces', 'Darien', 'deal', 'power', 'own.That', 'where', 'fun', '23', 'episodes', 'set', 'include', 'spectacular', 'scenarios', 'Darien', 'assigned', 'protect', 'witness', 'Raplph', 'phony', 'spiritualist', 'uncovered', 'great', 'danger', 'Tiresias', 'invisible', 'man', 'visit', 'When', 'Do', 'Chinese', 'government', 'thwarted', 'Cat', 'Mouse', '.The', ""'Fly"", 'wall', 'scenario', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'powerful', 'indeed.Vincent', 'Ventresca', 'Darien', 'con', 'man/invisible', 'man', 'Shannon', 'Kenny', 'new', ""'boss"", 'great', 'applomb.Look', 'can', 'local', 'video', 'store.Invisibly', 'yours.Tim', 'Lasiuta']",N/A

One of the cool things they do with the invisible man on this particular series, is that sometimes he goes nuts due to the power of the quicksilver gene that gave him his powers, which is more in line with the original HG Well's story. It's a fun show, with decent acting and good scripts.",4,Quicksilver!,1342051200,"07 12, 2012",2012,516,"['was', 'hesitant', 'checking', 'out', 'first', 'thinking', 'show', 'effects', 'looked', 'as', 'hokey', 'Secret', 'World', 'Alex', 'Mack', 'viewing', 'series', 'lot', 'enjoy', 'entertaining', 'fast-paced', 'show', 'One', 'cool', 'things', 'do', 'invisible', 'man', 'particular', 'series', 'sometimes', 'nuts', 'due', 'power', 'quicksilver', 'gene', 'gave', 'powers', 'more', 'line', 'original', 'HG', 'Well', 'story', 'fun', 'show', 'decent', 'acting', 'good', 'scripts']",N/A

It's a shame it was cancelled, but they were able to complete the story line in the 2 seasons that were completed. I highly recommend the show, sci-fi, X-file fans, even police drama fans will enjoy the show. The show is about Darien Fawks a burglary expert, caught one too many times by the police and as a plea to get out of jail takes his brothers advice to be apart of a gov't experiment. Fawks's brother Kevin heading up the team involved in the i-man project implants Darien with a gland that allows his to 'go invisible...' Things go wrong, the gland cannot be removed and without a shot of 'counter agent,' Darien's gland makes him go psycho, also called Quicksilver madness...
