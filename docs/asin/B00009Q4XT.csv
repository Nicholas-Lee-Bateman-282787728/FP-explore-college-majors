However what you didn't see in the tours you will get to see here.  This takes you from the beginning of The White House to the Clinton Administration.  It will take you where no other tours will take you in the history, Presidential Protection and the personal life of our President. So sit back and enjoy history at it's finest.",4,Welcome to Life at it's Finest.,1216857600,"07 24, 2008",2008,409,"['have', 'ever', 'been', 'White', 'House', 'will', 'take', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'However', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'tours', 'will', 'get', 'see', 'here', 'beginning', 'White', 'House', 'Clinton', 'Administration', 'will', 'take', 'where', 'other', 'tours', 'will', 'take', 'history', 'Presidential', 'Protection', 'personal', 'life', 'President', 'So', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'history', 'finest']",N/A

756694,A3C73MTBWBJGM2,B00009Q4XT,Himanshu Shangari,"[6, 9]",The only problem with this movie in my opinion is its running time. It could have also been limited to 60 minutes instead of 90 like Air Force One which is neither short nor to long and very accurate. This movie tells the history of the White House as to how Mr. George Washington decided to get it build and then afterwards the experiences of different Presidents and their families and the staff members. Also tells about the incidents and ups and downs faced by the House. Overall it is a well made informative movie but it is bit too long and to cover the length some material providing no information but only increasing the length has been introduced which could have been avoided.,3,Good one but no where near the Air Force One,1111795200,"03 26, 2005",2005,687,"['only', 'problem', 'movie', 'opinion', 'running', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'limited', '60', 'minutes', 'instead', '90', 'Air', 'Force', 'One', 'short', 'long', 'very', 'accurate', 'movie', 'history', 'White', 'House', 'how', 'Mr.', 'George', 'Washington', 'decided', 'get', 'build', 'then', 'afterwards', 'experiences', 'different', 'Presidents', 'families', 'staff', 'members', 'Also', 'incidents', 'ups', 'downs', 'faced', 'House', 'Overall', 'well', 'made', 'informative', 'movie', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'cover', 'length', 'material', 'providing', 'information', 'only', 'increasing', 'length', 'been', 'introduced', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'avoided']",N/A

Do not purchase it if you wish to know about the construction history of The White House as this documentary is more about the environment and workers in or of the place.,4,Morgan Freeman,1397692800,"04 17, 2014",2014,217,"['Morgan', 'Freemen', 'awesome', 'real', 'Do', 'not', 'purchase', 'wish', 'know', 'construction', 'history', 'White', 'House', 'documentary', 'more', 'environment', 'workers', 'place']",N/A
