507656,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B00000JQV3,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[0, 0]","""Naked Civil Servant"" is a superb movie starring John Hurt as Quentin Crisp. Hurt thoroughly embodies Crisp, so much so he starred as Crisp in the sequelAn Englishman in New York. Hurt gives his role dignity and grace- something that sets Crisp apart from both his gay&straight; friends. As Crisp's friends lose their sanity, go into prostitution, enter marriages for money, or enter convents to escape the world- he manages to keep his finely coiffed head. It's fitting that Hurt starred as theResident Alien (Nick Hern Books)around the time he was inAlien.Quentin Crisp realized his differentness early on. He didn't blend in with his fellow gays who wanted to assimilate; he didn't meet his parents' expectations that when he spent time with women, it wasn't because of sexual attraction. He had to learn to survive and thrive. Crisp comes to the sad realization that no ""Big Dark Man"" will come&save; him from his loneliness. Crisp was able to find contentment in practicing sexual abstinence, but he certainly didn't preach it to his fellow gays or straight friends. He probably would've disagreed withThe Battle for Normality: Self-Therapy for Homosexual PersonsWhen Crisp is wrongly convicted of soliciting, he gives an eloquent speech. It's powerful, and Hurt delivers it tremendously.

507659,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00000JQV3,C. O. DeRiemer,"[3, 3]","""Do you think a homosexual elephant has a terrible time of it?"" Most of us undoubtedly have asked that question at one time or another, but I doubt if any except Quentin Crisp have asked it with such innocent interest. Crisp was, in his own words, an unregenerate degenerate. He was an English homosexual who saw no reason why he shouldn't be who he was. He was effeminate. He dressed flamboyantly, favoring broad-brimmed fedoras and flowing scarves. He wore make-up and hennaed his carefully coifed hair. He was witty but not malicious. He was willing to take people as they were, and saw no reason why he shouldn't expect the same for himself. Says Sting, who wrote a song about Crisp, ""Quentin is a hero of mine, someone I know very well. He is gay, and he was gay at a time in history when it was dangerous to be so. He had people beating up on him on a daily basis, largely with the consent of the public. Yet, he continued to be himself.""The Naked Civil Servant, with a wonderfully nuanced performance by John Hurt as Crisp, takes us through Crisp's life until he was in his mid-seventies. Crisp died in 1999 when he was 90. Crisp apparently knew his own skin even as a child. As a young man, he tells us with innocent frankness, ""I had already discovered for myself one fact of life, the only fact of life I've ever fully understood. I have a message for those who, like me, inhabit a world of make believe...sexual intercourse is a poor substitute for masturbation."" That has to be one of the great autobiographical lines in English literature.Crisp is important because he simply would not become what he wasn't. He also seemed to be a remarkably sympathetic person, amusing and perceptive without the burden of seeming to be wise. ""Does he love you,"" a female friend asks about an awkward lover. ""You are a woman,"" Crisp says. ""You speak a language I do not understand. If love exists, which is something I wouldn't know, then love is never closing my hand even to the unlovable."" He's not only realistic (""The sex was alright in a domestic sort of way, but never share a narrow bed with a wide, single man.""), but also practical (""I have discovered a great labor-saving secret. After the first four years, the dust doesn't get any worse."").For a year he was a prostitute. For years he made a small living as a paid model in art classes. ""Being a model requires no education, no references and no previous experience. You have only to say `I do' and you're stuck with it for life...like marriage. I became a naked civil servant."" He came to admire America and, at 71, moved permanently to a small bed-sitter in the lower East side. ""The great difference between the Americans and the English is that Americans want you to succeed because they feel you may drag them forward with you, while the British want you to fail because they fear you may leave them behind.""Fame comes when he writes his autobiography, ""The Naked Civil Servant."" The book is turned into a British television movie starring John Hurt, which achieves great acclaim. Crisp finds an admiring audience for his wit and for the honesty of his life. When he is accosted by some nasty children because of how he looks, he stares at them and says, ""I defy you to do your worst. It can hardly be my worst. Mine has already and often happened to me. You cannot touch me now. I am one of the stately homos of England!""Still, when he enthusiastically agrees to have a movie made about him, he says, ""Any film, even the worst, is better than real life."" He says it with a smile, but it's an unsettling judgment.I finished the movie with a great deal of admiration for Quentin Crisp. And if anyone doubts that John Hurt is a superb actor, watch Hurt's performance. The DVD looks just fine. The extras include a commentary track with Hurt, the director Jack Gold and the associate producer Valerie Lambert.",4,"Quentin Crisp (and John Hurt): A fine combination of wit, honesty, humanity and mascara",1217116800,"07 27, 2008",2008,3872,"['Do', 'think', 'homosexual', 'elephant', 'terrible', 'time', 'Most', 'undoubtedly', 'have', 'asked', 'question', 'one', 'time', 'doubt', 'Quentin', 'Crisp', 'have', 'asked', 'such', 'innocent', 'interest', 'Crisp', 'was', 'own', 'words', 'unregenerate', 'degenerate', 'was', 'English', 'homosexual', 'who', 'saw', 'reason', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'who', 'was', 'was', 'effeminate', 'dressed', 'flamboyantly', 'favoring', 'broad-brimmed', 'fedoras', 'flowing', 'scarves', 'wore', 'make-up', 'hennaed', 'carefully', 'coifed', 'hair', 'was', 'witty', 'not', 'malicious', 'was', 'willing', 'take', 'people', 'were', 'saw', 'reason', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'expect', 'same', 'Sting', 'who', 'wrote', 'song', 'Crisp', 'Quentin', 'hero', 'mine', 'someone', 'know', 'very', 'well', 'gay', 'was', 'gay', 'time', 'history', 'when', 'was', 'dangerous', 'be', 'so', 'had', 'people', 'beating', 'up', 'daily', 'basis', 'largely', 'consent', 'public', 'continued', 'be', 'Naked', 'Civil', 'Servant', 'wonderfully', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Crisp', 'Crisp', 'life', 'was', 'mid-seventies', 'Crisp', 'died', '1999', 'when', 'was', '90', 'Crisp', 'apparently', 'knew', 'own', 'skin', 'even', 'child', 'young', 'man', 'innocent', 'frankness', 'had', 'already', 'discovered', 'one', 'fact', 'life', 'only', 'fact', 'life', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'fully', 'understood', 'have', 'message', 'who', 'inhabit', 'world', 'make', 'believe', 'sexual', 'intercourse', 'poor', 'substitute', 'masturbation', 'be', 'one', 'great', 'autobiographical', 'lines', 'English', 'literature.Crisp', 'important', 'simply', 'would', 'not', 'become', 'what', 'was', ""n't"", 'also', 'seemed', 'be', 'remarkably', 'sympathetic', 'person', 'amusing', 'perceptive', 'burden', 'seeming', 'be', 'wise', 'love', 'female', 'friend', 'awkward', 'lover', 'are', 'woman', 'Crisp', 'speak', 'language', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'love', 'exists', 'something', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'then', 'love', 'never', 'closing', 'hand', 'even', 'unlovable', 'not', 'only', 'realistic', 'sex', 'was', 'alright', 'domestic', 'sort', 'way', 'never', 'share', 'narrow', 'bed', 'wide', 'single', 'man', 'also', 'practical', 'have', 'discovered', 'great', 'labor-saving', 'secret', 'first', 'four', 'years', 'dust', ""n't"", 'get', 'worse', 'year', 'was', 'prostitute', 'years', 'made', 'small', 'living', 'paid', 'model', 'art', 'classes', 'Being', 'model', 'education', 'references', 'previous', 'experience', 'have', 'only', 'say', 'do', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'life', 'marriage', 'became', 'naked', 'civil', 'servant', 'came', 'admire', 'America', '71', 'moved', 'permanently', 'small', 'bed-sitter', 'lower', 'East', 'side', 'great', 'difference', 'Americans', 'English', 'Americans', 'want', 'succeed', 'feel', 'may', 'drag', 'forward', 'British', 'want', 'fail', 'fear', 'may', 'leave', 'Fame', 'when', 'autobiography', 'Naked', 'Civil', 'Servant', 'book', 'turned', 'British', 'television', 'movie', 'starring', 'John', 'Hurt', 'great', 'acclaim', 'Crisp', 'admiring', 'audience', 'wit', 'honesty', 'life', 'When', 'accosted', 'nasty', 'children', 'how', 'defy', 'do', 'worst', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'worst', 'Mine', 'already', 'often', 'happened', 'can', 'not', 'touch', 'now', 'am', 'one', 'stately', 'homos', 'England', 'Still', 'when', 'enthusiastically', 'have', 'movie', 'made', 'film', 'even', 'worst', 'better', 'real', 'life', 'smile', 'unsettling', 'judgment.I', 'finished', 'movie', 'great', 'deal', 'admiration', 'Quentin', 'Crisp', 'anyone', 'John', 'Hurt', 'superb', 'actor', 'watch', 'Hurt', 'performance', 'DVD', 'just', 'fine', 'extras', 'include', 'commentary', 'track', 'Hurt', 'director', 'Jack', 'Gold', 'associate', 'producer', 'Valerie', 'Lambert']",The Naked Civil Servant VHS

There is a pun on names here because John Hurt always looks wounded in his films. ( and delightfully Quinten Crisp's surname was originally Pratt which is a derogative name for pussy in England though not nearly as bad as the C word)John Hurt's empathy comes across in acting the character. The Naked Civil Servant had recently been scandalously published; having read it John Hurt took a professional interest in doing justice;  giving dignity to such an out-cast  and it is how he treated Crisp whenever they met.The film fails the book as it is so well written as is usually the case. For instance Crisp had the insociance to admit of how low he stooped by having a physical relationship with his friend from the asylum who was more physically repulsive than the crazed unkempt portrayal in the film. This was side-stepped out of sensitivity to the real Crisp. Like-wise  his arch high intelligence was greater than depicted in the film.

Sherwin,"[2, 2]","The Naked Civil Servant is a fascinating biopic by the BBC about the life and times of Quentin Crisp, although because it was filmed in 1975 it does not cover his life in the United States after he moved here from Great Britain. However, the movie is still quite good and very engaging; I was not bored in the least. The acting is impeccable: John Hurt turns out a superlative performance as Quentin Crisp; and the rest of the casting was very well done. We truly get the sense of what Quentin Crisp was about and what he experienced; and that's the hallmark of a fine biopic. The quality of the print could have been a bit better in spots but overall it's still quite good.We see how Quentin's preference for romance with men quickly caused discord between him and his parents from an early age. Mr. and Mrs. Crisp (Lloyd Lamble and Joan Ryan) call in a doctor (Frank Forsyth) to see if Quentin can be ""cured"" but the doctor disappoints his two parents; Quentin's father was particularly nasty toward him. It's no wonder Quentin left home for good as soon as he was able to! In addition, we see Quentin's countless ups and downs as well as his coping strategies, most of which are the result of his insistence of dressing in a rather flamboyant way, dying his very long hair red and essentially simply being openly gay in a place and time when being gay was completely unacceptable. Unfortunately, Quentin gets beaten up quite a bit; but he also experiences some happiness at parties with friends who accept him for the human being that he is and that's a plus.We also see some of Quentin's interpersonal relationships with other men. There's the fellow who goes by the nickname ""Thumbnails"" (Colin Higgins); ""Thumbnails"" is Quentin's roommate early on after Quentin leaves his childhood home. Some of the men Quentin meets are for brief encounters; one man whom Quentin refers to as ""Barndoor"" (John Rhys-Davies) stays in his life for almost three years.Quentin eventually enters modeling; and this is the point at which he begins to refer to himself as a ""Naked Civil Servant."" No, John Hurt who plays Quentin is not literally naked in these scenes; but John Hurt's costume is scant to say the least.The DVD comes with a few nice extras: we get a featurette with Quentin Crisp himself; an optional audio commentary and scene selection. There are optional English subtitles for those of us who need them.I could tell you more of Quentin's life and experiences that you'll see on this DVD; but I don't want to spoil it for you. Suffice it to say that this is a very well done biopic; and the opening brief introduction by Quentin Crisp himself is done in good taste. I highly recommend this film for anyone who is interested in the life and times of Quentin Crisp; and people who are interested in gay life in England when being gay was still considered a mental illness would do well to get this film.",5,"fine, intriguing biopic--with excellent acting, too",1243641600,"05 30, 2009",2009,2903,"['Naked', 'Civil', 'Servant', 'fascinating', 'biopic', 'BBC', 'life', 'times', 'Quentin', 'Crisp', 'was', 'filmed', '1975', 'not', 'cover', 'life', 'United', 'States', 'moved', 'here', 'Great', 'Britain', 'However', 'movie', 'still', 'quite', 'good', 'very', 'engaging', 'was', 'not', 'bored', 'least', 'acting', 'impeccable', 'John', 'Hurt', 'out', 'superlative', 'performance', 'Quentin', 'Crisp', 'rest', 'casting', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'truly', 'get', 'sense', 'what', 'Quentin', 'Crisp', 'was', 'about', 'what', 'experienced', 'hallmark', 'fine', 'biopic', 'quality', 'print', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'better', 'spots', 'overall', 'still', 'quite', 'good.We', 'see', 'how', 'Quentin', 'preference', 'romance', 'men', 'quickly', 'caused', 'discord', 'parents', 'early', 'age', 'Mr.', 'Mrs', 'Crisp', 'Lloyd', 'Lamble', 'Joan', 'Ryan', 'call', 'doctor', 'Frank', 'Forsyth', 'see', 'Quentin', 'can', 'be', 'cured', 'doctor', 'two', 'parents', 'Quentin', 'father', 'was', 'particularly', 'nasty', 'wonder', 'Quentin', 'left', 'home', 'good', 'as', 'soon', 'was', 'able', 'addition', 'see', 'Quentin', 'countless', 'ups', 'downs', 'as', 'well', 'coping', 'strategies', 'most', 'are', 'result', 'insistence', 'dressing', 'rather', 'flamboyant', 'way', 'dying', 'very', 'long', 'hair', 'red', 'essentially', 'simply', 'being', 'openly', 'gay', 'place', 'time', 'when', 'being', 'gay', 'was', 'completely', 'unacceptable', 'Unfortunately', 'Quentin', 'beaten', 'up', 'quite', 'bit', 'also', 'happiness', 'parties', 'friends', 'who', 'accept', 'human', 'being', 'plus.We', 'also', 'see', 'Quentin', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'other', 'men', 'fellow', 'who', 'nickname', 'Thumbnails', 'Colin', 'Higgins', 'Thumbnails', 'Quentin', 'roommate', 'early', 'Quentin', 'childhood', 'home', 'men', 'Quentin', 'meets', 'are', 'brief', 'encounters', 'one', 'man', 'whom', 'refers', 'Barndoor', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies', 'life', 'almost', 'three', 'years.Quentin', 'eventually', 'enters', 'modeling', 'point', 'refer', 'Naked', 'Civil', 'Servant', 'No', 'John', 'Hurt', 'who', 'Quentin', 'not', 'literally', 'naked', 'scenes', 'John', 'Hurt', 'costume', 'scant', 'say', 'least.The', 'DVD', 'few', 'nice', 'extras', 'get', 'featurette', 'Quentin', 'Crisp', 'optional', 'audio', 'commentary', 'scene', 'selection', 'are', 'optional', 'English', 'subtitles', 'who', 'need', 'them.I', 'could', 'tell', 'more', 'Quentin', 'life', 'experiences', ""'ll"", 'see', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'Suffice', 'say', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'biopic', 'opening', 'brief', 'introduction', 'Quentin', 'Crisp', 'done', 'good', 'taste', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'life', 'times', 'Quentin', 'Crisp', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'gay', 'life', 'England', 'when', 'being', 'gay', 'was', 'still', 'considered', 'mental', 'illness', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'get', 'film']",The Naked Civil Servant VHS

Like Henry Higgins' definition of good manners, Quentin was always the same to everyone, in every circumstance; public or private, the man remained his own spectacular creation, and the marvelous Hurt shows the origins of what was to become an internationally celebrated life.
