229868,A25A0MJV5TXDR8,6300251217,"A customer ""yourpalvince""","[1, 2]","Benjamin Braddock meets Alex and the Droogs.  This movie has some of the tightest and most blood-curdling sequences of any thriller, thanks largely to the crisp editing.  The final, extended home invasion sequence (and I don't mean &quot;home invasion&quot; as the current trendy euphemism for &quot;burglary&quot; -- I mean a literal, terrifying home invasion) is particularly harrowing because the quick cutting constantly throws you off:  what are you seeing now, and for how long?  It was criticized at the time for its fascistic view of humanity, but I think the movie earns its stance (unlike &quot;Dirty Harry,&quot; which came out at the same time and was considerably clumsier).  The rape scene is also particularly incendiary to a lot of folks, but remember, although Susan George's character might ask for it, that doesn't mean all women ask for it.  The important thing is that she's a consistent character from the start.  It's a fiction, not a polemic.My biggest complaint:  The finale is precipitated by an incident lifted too freely from &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; -- it pulls you out of the story because everything else has been so original.One of my favorite moments:  the chilling sense of portent when we see the shadowy visage of the village priest at the celebration as he reads the line, &quot;...and all the saints.&quot;",5,One of the best-edited thrillers ever,978652800,"01 5, 2001",2001,1347,"['Benjamin', 'Braddock', 'meets', 'Alex', 'Droogs', 'movie', 'tightest', 'most', 'blood-curdling', 'sequences', 'thriller', 'thanks', 'largely', 'crisp', 'editing', 'final', 'extended', 'home', 'invasion', 'sequence', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'quot', 'home', 'invasion', 'quot', 'current', 'trendy', 'euphemism', 'quot', 'burglary', 'quot', 'mean', 'literal', 'terrifying', 'home', 'invasion', 'particularly', 'harrowing', 'quick', 'cutting', 'constantly', 'off', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'now', 'how', 'long', 'was', 'criticized', 'time', 'fascistic', 'view', 'humanity', 'think', 'movie', 'stance', 'quot', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'quot', 'came', 'out', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'considerably', 'clumsier', 'rape', 'scene', 'also', 'particularly', 'incendiary', 'lot', 'folks', 'remember', 'Susan', 'George', 'character', 'might', 'ask', ""n't"", 'mean', 'women', 'ask', 'important', 'thing', 'consistent', 'character', 'start', 'fiction', 'not', 'polemic.My', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'finale', 'precipitated', 'incident', 'lifted', 'too', 'freely', 'quot', 'Mice', 'Men', 'quot', 'story', 'everything', 'else', 'been', 'so', 'original.One', 'favorite', 'moments', 'chilling', 'sense', 'portent', 'when', 'see', 'shadowy', 'visage', 'village', 'priest', 'celebration', 'line', 'quot', 'saints.', 'quot']",Straw Dogs VHS

229871,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6300251217,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 3]","The whole time I sat through `Straw Dogs' I was uncomfortable; not in a bad way though.  Director Sam Peckinpah does a phenomenal job of making every sequence feel more and more unnerving, even if the violence and terror doesn't truly take place until the tale end of the film.  You feel dirty, almost as if you were a voyeur taking a peek in on the lives of this beautifully conflicted couple as they expose themselves to you; flaws and all.You feel like the enemy.The film tells the story of David and Amy Sumner, a young couple who moves to rural England while David is on sabbatical.  Amy once grew up in the small town, and her new husband, the book smart yet socially clueless mathematician, is less than welcomed by the community.  As David immerses himself in his work his relationship with his wife begins to strain until she finds herself taunting the eyes of a local ex-boyfriend who happens to be helping fix up the Sumner's home.  This teasing can only go so far before it takes a turn for the worse, and when a seemingly mutual tryst goes all sorts of wrong it paves the way for the Sumner's new life to come crashing down on them.The film is breathtakingly honest and brutal in its delivery; very gritty and raw.  There are scenes that are very hard to stomach, not necessarily because they are gruesome or explicit (the violence is mild compared to the horror movies of today) but because each and every scene feels real.The acting aids in this feeling of reality, especially from the two leads, Dustin Hoffman and Susan George.  I personally feel that George is the standout here.  Her characters development is very passionate and convincing.  The big pivotal `tryst' scene is the best acting in the entire film; the confliction (`do I want to, yes, no, yes, no') and then raw emotion is utterly mesmerizing.  Hoffman is also very good here, some of his best work really.  He captures his characters sense of justice, and as the film escalates into the pits of violence we see his views change drastically, yet always convincingly.My one complaint is that, while the film seems to have a lot to say about human interaction and the natural desire to exact pure justice, it seems to lose its head in the finale.  It almost feels like just an excuse to bleed forth with unrelenting violence.  It has a purpose, but it doesn't feel like it, so it winds up feeling unnecessary.  That is just my personal take.  Honestly, the film up until the finale is much more successful in delivering the haunting chill with the quiet moments of uncertainty.  The fast paced and rather frustrating barrage that is the final ten minutes feels like too much at once.  It's not a bad way to go out, but it's not the way I would have chosen.Still, there is much to be said about this film and its powerful impact.  One can easily draw the moral code being flaunted throughout the piece; a certain warning against acting on our imperfect desires and impulses.  No one within this film outside of David (who is the outsider here) restrains themselves, which serves as a lurid foundation for our own social standing.  Are we a people who pride ourselves on control, or are we happy to allow our true person shine through, no matter how devastating the after effects?  `Straw Dogs' is a disturbing look at what life without control would look like.",4,Are we really this uncivil?,1233532800,"02 2, 2009",2009,3340,"['whole', 'time', 'sat', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'was', 'uncomfortable', 'not', 'bad', 'way', 'Director', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'making', 'sequence', 'feel', 'more', 'more', 'unnerving', 'even', 'violence', 'terror', ""n't"", 'truly', 'take', 'place', 'tale', 'end', 'film', 'feel', 'dirty', 'almost', 'were', 'voyeur', 'taking', 'peek', 'lives', 'beautifully', 'conflicted', 'couple', 'expose', 'flaws', 'all.You', 'feel', 'enemy.The', 'film', 'story', 'David', 'Amy', 'Sumner', 'young', 'couple', 'who', 'rural', 'England', 'David', 'sabbatical', 'Amy', 'once', 'grew', 'up', 'small', 'town', 'new', 'husband', 'book', 'smart', 'yet', 'socially', 'clueless', 'mathematician', 'less', 'welcomed', 'community', 'David', 'work', 'relationship', 'wife', 'strain', 'taunting', 'eyes', 'local', 'ex-boyfriend', 'who', 'be', 'helping', 'fix', 'up', 'Sumner', 'home', 'teasing', 'can', 'only', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'turn', 'worse', 'when', 'seemingly', 'mutual', 'tryst', 'sorts', 'wrong', 'way', 'Sumner', 'new', 'life', 'come', 'crashing', 'down', 'them.The', 'film', 'breathtakingly', 'honest', 'brutal', 'delivery', 'very', 'gritty', 'raw', 'are', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'hard', 'stomach', 'not', 'necessarily', 'are', 'gruesome', 'explicit', 'violence', 'mild', 'compared', 'horror', 'movies', 'today', 'scene', 'real.The', 'acting', 'aids', 'feeling', 'reality', 'especially', 'two', 'leads', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Susan', 'George', 'personally', 'feel', 'George', 'standout', 'here', 'characters', 'development', 'very', 'passionate', 'convincing', 'big', 'pivotal', 'tryst', 'scene', 'best', 'acting', 'entire', 'film', 'confliction', 'do', 'want', 'yes', 'yes', 'then', 'raw', 'emotion', 'utterly', 'mesmerizing', 'Hoffman', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'here', 'best', 'work', 'really', 'characters', 'sense', 'justice', 'film', 'pits', 'violence', 'see', 'views', 'change', 'drastically', 'yet', 'always', 'convincingly.My', 'one', 'complaint', 'film', 'have', 'lot', 'say', 'human', 'interaction', 'natural', 'desire', 'exact', 'pure', 'justice', 'lose', 'head', 'finale', 'almost', 'just', 'excuse', 'bleed', 'forth', 'unrelenting', 'violence', 'purpose', ""n't"", 'feel', 'up', 'feeling', 'unnecessary', 'just', 'personal', 'take', 'Honestly', 'film', 'up', 'finale', 'much', 'more', 'successful', 'delivering', 'haunting', 'chill', 'quiet', 'moments', 'uncertainty', 'fast', 'paced', 'rather', 'frustrating', 'barrage', 'final', 'ten', 'minutes', 'feels', 'too', 'much', 'once', 'not', 'bad', 'way', 'go', 'out', 'not', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'chosen.Still', 'much', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'powerful', 'impact', 'One', 'can', 'easily', 'draw', 'moral', 'code', 'being', 'flaunted', 'piece', 'certain', 'warning', 'acting', 'imperfect', 'desires', 'impulses', 'one', 'film', 'David', 'who', 'outsider', 'here', 'lurid', 'foundation', 'own', 'social', 'standing', 'Are', 'people', 'who', 'pride', 'control', 'are', 'happy', 'allow', 'true', 'person', 'shine', 'matter', 'how', 'devastating', 'effects', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'disturbing', 'look', 'what', 'life', 'control', 'would', 'look']",Straw Dogs VHS
229872,AI37X1O7K72FZ,6300251217,Anti-Hipster,"[1, 2]","I put off seeing Straw Dogs for years thinking it was a revenge picture. I had the idea that it was about a timid man whose threshold for abuse is tested by some bullies. If that were all the film was about it wouldn't be worth my time and it certainly wouldn't be worth the acclaim it has received. Straw Dogs is more than a simple tale of a man pushed too far; it's about the nasty side of human nature, particularly the way women play men off against each other.The movie is set in a small English village, where Hoffman and his wife are vacationing. His wife has some history with one of the local men. The man and his friends do some work on Hoffman's vacation home. At some point, Hoffman's wife begins nagging him to confront the men. I found this odd. Why does he need to confront them, I wondered? Just because they're outside laughing? For whatever reason, she has an unseemly desire to get Hoffman into a violent confrontation with the men. Hoffman is unresponsive to his wife's goading, which frustrates her, so she turns her attention to the men, whom she entices by strutting in front of a window nude. Her passive-aggressive game pays off by the end of the film, at which point the men are trying to murder her and Hoffman.I found the last 20 minutes of the film frustrating because Hoffman is too stupid to realize why the men are after him. He doesn't realize that his wife provoked the whole episode. If the men were so unpleasant, why did they allow them to work on the home? Why didn't they spend their vacation somewhere else? His wife knew this would happen. She worked to make it happen, then played damsel in distress. Hoffman doesn't see everything the audience does, but he should be able piece things together.I'm aware that the film has been remade, but I can't imagine that it would portray the female character this way.

The fact is that Sam Peckinpah was a controversial man: in his films, violence was a necessary test that every man had to face in order to prove  his manhood. Peckinpah was a hard man, and his vision of life and humanity  is shown in Straw Dogs, you may agree with him or not, but you will have to  accept the basic concept: in the heart of every coward, burns a beast, a  straw dog. And Peckinpah says in his movie that when you are caught in a  dangerous situation, you change, and you are capable to kill or do anything  in order to survive. No one did it better than this filmmaker, maybe  Boorman with Deliverance, but Straw Dogs is a cruel testimony of the  cruelty that common men are capable to do.Hoffman is terrific, and in the  end, when his house and wife are in danger, his whole coward character  changes, and he turns into a explosive and brutal murderer.

While I understand, and sometimes participate in, suspension of belief this movie had me scratching my head to say the least. While no movie is perfect by any means, this one had so many potholes you could drive a fleet of trucks through.I have to agree with others regarding the the rather explicit mysogynistic tendencies of the director. Case in point: the first appearance of the female lead (Amy) is a close-up of her erect nipples through a sweater. Talk about first impressions! Also, the often mentioned rape scenes, the first one in particular. How many women come on to, then reject, then come on to their rapist! While home alone in her bathrobe, she not only lets this guy in the house but offers him alcohol literally within the first 5 seconds! When he initially forces himself on her, she appears to be alternately returning and rejecting his kisses. This is after he's smacked her around a couple times. As if it couldn't be any more puzzling, during the rape she sensuously tells him to go slower (WTF!) then afterwards asks him to hold her in some twisted post-coital embrace! I'm sorry, but isn't rape supposed to be a brutal and violent violation of another human being for which people that perpetrate such a crime (even in that era) rightfully get locked away for long periods of time!?The ""awaking of the beast within"" for Dustin Hoffman's character was wrong on so many levels. Granted, he didn't know at that the time that he was actually protecting a pedophile who had just murdered a child. But during all the brouhaha, he hears his wife screaming from upstairs and rushes to the bedroom to find the guy he's protecting trying to rape his wife! He pulls the guy off of her and merely gives him a disapproving LOOK (shaking his head ""NO"") before locking him in the attic? Are you kidding me?The last thing I'll point out about this film is the irony of Hoffman's character being a mathematician yet he can't count to five! There were a total of 5 bad guys out there and after he's dispatched of 4 of them he says: ""I've got them all"". Of course, he quickly discovers he didn't count correctly. In a brief aside, since when does a foot injury become a fatal injury? Just one of those things that make you go: ""Hmm.""What I find most amusing are the people that find this movie so deep and profound. My first thought was: did they watch the same movie I did?

Straw Dogs does everything but this; it begins quietly and ends bleakly, you'd be heart broken if you weren't so scarred and trembling.Sure, Hoffman goes from mouse to ""man"", ""but at what cost?"", the film asks.  His already crumbling marriage is utterly obliterated by the final sequence of the film, where he declares that he's no idea how to get home, because what once was his house, wife and all, is no longer a part of him.It's a statement on many things: the animal nature of the human being: territory, sex, violence, pride; the futility of law.

Straw Dogs knows no boundaries and eventually becomes a violent work of art. The awesome performances are given especially by Dustin Hoffman and Susan George. High tension is ravaged throughout the film, creating a border between horror and terror. The brilliant characterization and the astute direction by Sam Peckinpah make Straw Dogs a roller coaster of clashes among violence, principles, emotions, and depravity. All together come into a state of flux and explodes in front of me in Straw Dogs. Right from the beginning, I knew something was going to happen, but I wasn't entirely sure of what is what. It is a masterfully unpredictable thriller. I've seen that Straw Dogs is a controversial picture, but actually, it shouldn't be regarded as one. As for Susan George, it is a stroke of genius in the development of her character and let her be really passive about what, although damaging and perhaps not, had happened to her. It's more of a psychological evaluation by looking at her character than it is from an armchair standpoint. Again, Straw Dogs is a masterpiece, delicately transposed into the beautiful style in an explosive manner, with a great piece of writing and tension-building development of the plot.1/13: Straw Dogs is one of the three great pictures of Sam Peckinpah's career that uses a distinctive brand of editing and photography. It starts with The Wild Bunch followed by Straw Dogs and Junior Bonner. Obviously in the first two, there is a slow build-up of tensions, leading to the final breaking point where hell all breaks loose. That's when it becomes the focal point of the film: violent, bloody, and unrelenting. There is nothing like it before and since then. That's why Sam Peckinpah was a unique director.

An American mathematician (Dustin Hoffman) and his sexy British wife Susan George are tired of the violence of the US so move to the wife's home town in England. What seems to be an idyllic new beginning is shattered when they find themselves harrassed by several local hooligans. Watching STRAW DOGS is like being subjected to chinese water torture, Peckinpah builds the tension slowly and with such expertise that though everybody knows what is going to happen to the couple it's a matter of WHEN.  The violence is not glamorised, nor as graphic as the likes of I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE. I'm not a huge geek or anything, but I will say that this is the type of movie intellectuals pee their pants over and debate over tiny cups of espresso in arty-farty cafes. As more of a beer and meatball sub kinda guy I'll spare you the varisty style nonsense and say that STRAW DOGS is a definite must-see, with Hoffman giving one of his best performances (which is REALLY saying something considering the likes of LENNY, PAPILLON etc etc).

229879,A2YAABMT80RLYA,6300251217,Ben Rowland,"[17, 21]","Anyone who has ever wrote on the subject of movie violence has ackowledged Sam Peckinpah, both for this 1969 masterpiece ""The Wild Bunch"" and his gritty ""Straw Dogs"". Both are fantastic movies, but I have always loved ""Straw Dogs"" in particular. Criterion has finally done the movie justice with this superb DVD package, one that any serious movie collector would be proud to own.This is the classic revenge formula, with a young American mathematician (Dustin Hoffman) and his sexy British wife (Susan George) moving to a small town in England and soon find themselves in battle with the drunken and brutish locals. Hoffman's character, as a mild-mannered bookworm, is contrasted by his later rage when he must defend himself and his home. The DVD cites this movie as ""a harrowing and masterful investigation of masculinity and the nature of violence"", which perfectly describes the tone of the film, as well as the intended message.The violence in ""Straw Dogs"" is, while not overly graphic, potent nonetheless. It also has one of the most brutal rape scenes ever done on film. Both in terms of structure and content, ""Straw Dogs"" was well ahead of it's time. The acting is solid, and the script is beautifully written. The characters range from people we empathize with to people we love to hate. Despite the age (the movie was released in 1971), ""Straw Dogs"" never seems dated.The Criterion DVD is packed with quality extras, starying with audio commentary by film scholar Stephen Prince. Thankfully, it is not overly intellectual, but also doesn't lack insight, and it quite easy to follow. The documentary ""Sam Peckinpah: Man of Iron"" is an interesting 80 minute documentary that has interviews with his friends and family. Although no footage from his movies is shown, and no interviews with the man himself, we get a lot of insight into Peckinpah's life and work. Next is the Behind-the-scenes footage, which is rough at times but still fun to watch. The Dustin Hoffman segment runs for 30 minutes.Criterion have excelled themselves with ""Straw Dogs"", and you can expect to spend at least 4 hours with this DVD. The transfer is the best ever released, and the selection of extras makes this worth every penny.

229880,A34PAZQ73SL163,6300251217,"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!""","[23, 35]","There are few movies that more melodically ring the chimes of discovery than Sam Peckinpah's 1971 classic, Straw Dogs.""  I made the point of seeing it the other day after coming across a review that condemned its unsavory and animalistic view of human nature.  At that point it became a ""must see"" for me.  A few moments past the credits, one comprehends why it so traumatizes our polystyrene (over)sensibilities.  There is nothing friendly, forgiving, or welcoming about it.  The movie is uncompromising and forces the audience to examine urges which they would deny having.  In our age of therapism, such affronts have little appeal, but, for this reason alone, it a film that should be enshrined in our cultural memory.""Straw Dogs"" was crafted by a man who, when moderately sober, was one of the most talented directors of his time.  Sam Peckinpah never saw entertainment as being an end in itself.  Here, his embellishments create a tale of tremendous anthropological significance.  It illuminates our inner drives more thoroughly than any of the books you'll find on display in the self-help section of your local bookstore.Although, that is not to say that the film only has value due to its theoretical implications as it is strong on the surface.  It possesses a clever plot and features characters that easily capture our interest.  With the force of a Hummer, it propels us into the personal world of an intellectual, David (Dustin Hoffman), who is isolated in a foreign country and surrounded by hostile forces that modernity has no way to explain or dismiss.  His wife, Amy (Susan George), should have been a towline to safety, but, instead, her loyalties are nebulous and her actions seem to willingly exacerbate every problem that arises.The year 1971 is not remembered as a glorious time, but, back then, a story like this one could still be told.  Nowadays it would be self-censored by Hollywood.  Life from the vantage point of our ancestral African Savannah is no longer welcome or acceptable to the social engineers of our day.  They do not wish us to see it, and, if we do, it is only allowable through the microscopic analysis of bones and rubble.""Straw Dogs"" transcends our diagnostic categorizations and instead reveals the psychology of the tribe.  Dustin Hoffman is trapped in a situation where playing a gentleman means that one will be eaten alive. In today's environment, the gelled and feminized metrosexual would be garroted and have their head put on a pole, while those women wishing ""to have it all"" would quickly find themselves inseminated or dead.  The main character's determination to defend himself results in his repressed instincts being released, and this forever changes him. The astrophysicist can never return to his old life.  His tasteful, prefabricated self is no more.  Indeed, he announces this in the final scene when he informs a guilty man, who was the catalyst for the movie's climax, that he ""doesn't know the way home either.""The most revealing, and dare I say ""revolutionary"", character in the film is the wife.  Susan George plays a woman whose agenda could not differ more radically from that of her husband's.  George craves Hoffman's attention and does not understand why he would rather work rather than interact with her.  To secure his regard, she even goes so far as to sabotage his efforts by changing around the mathematical signs he has written upon a blackboard. She also behaves seductively towards the workmen, and refuses to wear a bra in their presence.  When she opens up the car door, she hikes up her skirt so that they can more fully gaze at her legs.  Hoffman warns her that her teasing demeanor is partly to blame for their malattentions.  By his making such a statement alone, the film would be judged to be beyond the pale by radical feminists.  Indeed, in the 1990s when Camille Paglia made a similar statement about female dress, it resulted in a firestorm of feminista ire.A hallmark of political correctness is to question the psychology behind critics who question the dogma.  It is the ""let's call you Sakharhov"" approach to argumentation.  Contradictory positions are never responded to but psychologized instead.  Admiration of ""Straw Dogs"" would be interpreted as an individual's personal affirmation of violence and barbarity, but, of course, it is no such thing and actually the polar opposite.  To treasure the film is to value the fragile balance that is our society.  The audience embraces Hoffman for his resourcefulness and we are elated when the village louts receive exactly what they deserve.  An isolated intellectual in the beginning becomes a symbol for every domesticated man by the end.  The film forces us to be grateful for the civilization to which we were born.  It is a civilization that protects our mothers, wives, sisters, and daughters from predators...and defends us from ourselves.  ""Straw Dogs"" reminds us just how fragile our hold is over the invisible forces within.",5,"Men, Women, and the Invisible.",1118102400,"06 7, 2005",2005,4985,"['are', 'few', 'movies', 'more', 'melodically', 'ring', 'chimes', 'discovery', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', '1971', 'classic', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'made', 'point', 'seeing', 'other', 'day', 'coming', 'review', 'condemned', 'unsavory', 'animalistic', 'view', 'human', 'nature', 'point', 'became', 'must', 'see', 'few', 'moments', 'credits', 'one', 'why', 'so', 'polystyrene', 'sensibilities', 'nothing', 'friendly', 'forgiving', 'welcoming', 'movie', 'uncompromising', 'audience', 'examine', 'urges', 'would', 'deny', 'having', 'age', 'therapism', 'such', 'affronts', 'have', 'little', 'appeal', 'reason', 'alone', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'enshrined', 'cultural', 'memory', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'was', 'crafted', 'man', 'who', 'when', 'moderately', 'sober', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'directors', 'time', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'never', 'saw', 'entertainment', 'being', 'end', 'Here', 'embellishments', 'create', 'tale', 'tremendous', 'anthropological', 'significance', 'inner', 'drives', 'more', 'thoroughly', 'books', ""'ll"", 'find', 'display', 'self-help', 'section', 'local', 'bookstore.Although', 'not', 'say', 'film', 'only', 'value', 'due', 'theoretical', 'implications', 'strong', 'surface', 'clever', 'plot', 'characters', 'easily', 'interest', 'force', 'Hummer', 'personal', 'world', 'intellectual', 'David', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'isolated', 'foreign', 'country', 'surrounded', 'hostile', 'forces', 'modernity', 'way', 'explain', 'dismiss', 'wife', 'Amy', 'Susan', 'George', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'towline', 'safety', 'instead', 'loyalties', 'are', 'nebulous', 'actions', 'seem', 'willingly', 'exacerbate', 'problem', 'arises.The', 'year', '1971', 'not', 'remembered', 'glorious', 'time', 'back', 'then', 'story', 'one', 'could', 'still', 'be', 'told', 'would', 'be', 'self-censored', 'Hollywood', 'Life', 'vantage', 'point', 'ancestral', 'African', 'Savannah', 'no', 'longer', 'welcome', 'acceptable', 'social', 'engineers', 'day', 'do', 'not', 'wish', 'see', 'do', 'only', 'allowable', 'microscopic', 'analysis', 'bones', 'rubble', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'diagnostic', 'categorizations', 'instead', 'reveals', 'psychology', 'tribe', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'trapped', 'situation', 'where', 'playing', 'gentleman', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'eaten', 'alive', 'today', 'environment', 'gelled', 'feminized', 'metrosexual', 'would', 'be', 'garroted', 'have', 'head', 'put', 'pole', 'women', 'wishing', 'have', 'would', 'quickly', 'find', 'inseminated', 'dead', 'main', 'character', 'determination', 'defend', 'results', 'repressed', 'instincts', 'being', 'released', 'forever', 'astrophysicist', 'can', 'never', 'return', 'old', 'life', 'tasteful', 'prefabricated', 'self', 'more', 'Indeed', 'final', 'scene', 'when', 'guilty', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'catalyst', 'movie', 'climax', ""n't"", 'know', 'way', 'home', 'either', 'most', 'revealing', 'dare', 'say', 'revolutionary', 'character', 'film', 'wife', 'Susan', 'George', 'woman', 'agenda', 'could', 'not', 'differ', 'more', 'radically', 'husband', 'George', 'Hoffman', 'attention', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'would', 'rather', 'work', 'rather', 'interact', 'secure', 'regard', 'even', 'so', 'far', 'sabotage', 'efforts', 'changing', 'mathematical', 'signs', 'written', 'blackboard', 'also', 'seductively', 'workmen', 'wear', 'bra', 'presence', 'When', 'car', 'door', 'up', 'skirt', 'can', 'more', 'fully', 'gaze', 'legs', 'Hoffman', 'teasing', 'demeanor', 'partly', 'blame', 'malattentions', 'making', 'such', 'statement', 'alone', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'judged', 'be', 'pale', 'radical', 'feminists', 'Indeed', '1990s', 'when', 'Camille', 'Paglia', 'made', 'similar', 'statement', 'female', 'dress', 'resulted', 'firestorm', 'feminista', 'ire.A', 'hallmark', 'political', 'correctness', 'question', 'psychology', 'critics', 'who', 'question', 'dogma', 'let', 'call', 'Sakharhov', 'approach', 'argumentation', 'Contradictory', 'positions', 'are', 'never', 'responded', 'psychologized', 'instead', 'Admiration', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'would', 'be', 'interpreted', 'individual', 'personal', 'affirmation', 'violence', 'barbarity', 'course', 'such', 'thing', 'actually', 'polar', 'opposite', 'treasure', 'film', 'value', 'fragile', 'balance', 'society', 'audience', 'Hoffman', 'resourcefulness', 'are', 'elated', 'when', 'village', 'receive', 'exactly', 'what', 'deserve', 'isolated', 'intellectual', 'beginning', 'symbol', 'domesticated', 'man', 'end', 'film', 'forces', 'be', 'grateful', 'civilization', 'were', 'born', 'civilization', 'mothers', 'wives', 'sisters', 'daughters', 'predators', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'just', 'how', 'fragile', 'hold', 'invisible', 'forces']",Straw Dogs VHS

Or does Straw Dogs advocate the use of violence in extreame circumstanes?David Summner is a math academic. He and his English wife, Amy, move to England's countryside in 1971. Amy's home town. His wife implies early in the movie that they have gone there because David did not want to take a side during the campus upevil, a big issue in America in the early 70s. This was only a few years after the Columbia takeover, and Kent State.Neither David or Amy find the peace they look for in the UK. Both are soon confronted by  the ruffian villagers, who are doing repair work at the Summners. One of them has been in jail, and the other had a long ago daliance with Amy. These are not nice man, but it hardly helps matters when Amy stops, topless, at a window in front of the workers. This is no justification for anything, but with these men and with 1971 standards, it is a foolish move.Eventually, the men distract David, and Amy is raped, first by her former suiter, and then much more forceably by another in the possee. She does not tell David, but, he knows. Still, he does not confront the men.But he does, the next day. When a disabled man accidently kills the daughter of one of the toughs, David accidently hits him in his car, and takes him home to care for him and protect him from the gang. The hoods arrive, and demand David hand him over. David refuses, and the men raid the house, setting fires, trying to get in.He has had enough, and David fends them off with guns, knives, and homemade hot acid he prepares on his stove. He is transformed: at one point, one of the men is bound, his neck on broken glass, and the once jellyfish David says ""good, I hope you slit your throat."" Amy at first refuses to help David, but he, slapping her, litterally threatens to kill her if she does not. ""We're dead if they get in."" he saysOne by one and with increasing relish, David kills all the men,On the surface, the arguement that this is a pro-violent film is pretty strong. David seems to get vindication for himself, and Amy, by confronting and winning the battle with these sociopaths.But at what price: David ends the film, clothes torn, blood stained,his home in ruins. He has hit his wife and crossed lines he can never uncross. Was he right? Did he have any other real options? What has this done to him at his core--he will cetianly never be the person he was before that night. His marrage: what is going to happen to both these people?In 1971, you could apply these questions to Vietnam, student uprisings, race riots. Now, you could ask: what do we do about an Osama Bin Ladin, a Taliban? How does a peaceful person act when confroted by an amoral bully? Eight years after 9/11, Abu Grabe, Gauntonamo Bay, are WE ever going to be the same?

If it stimulates thought, pushes into the recesses of the mind, remains memorable for decades. What person, not having been tested,  knows exactly how they would behave if threatened by an overpowering group of thugs, or how, if a woman, they were raped and what their post-rape reaction might be? The film is extremely unsettling, and, I suggest, we are not entirely sure that we wouldn't behave rather like the Hoffman or George characters in similar circumstances. That is, none of us are as resolute and heroic as we'd like to think we are, or as Hollywood pretends we can be. This film is real --- Bruce Willis and Gary Cooper are romantic fantasies. Like other Peckinpah films, there is nothing feelgood about this story. He works at the cutting edge of the unbeautiful truth of these matters.The acting is superb. Peckinpah extracts terrific performances from both Hoffman and George. Especially George, perhaps. The build-up of claustrophobic tension is exceptionally well directed. It resembles Polanski's Repulsion, to some extent. A collection of highly flawed personalities, with relationships on the brink of disintegration, each damaging the other's psyche. A good deal more true to life, in my experience, than the masterful command and surmounting of every challenge presented which characterizes the stereotypical Western drama.

229884,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,6300251217,Carl Manes,"[4, 5]","A brilliant but apprehensive mathematician and his beautiful wife retreat to an old farmhouse in the English countryside to escape the political strife that they encountered in America. After settling into their new home, their marriage continues to falter as Amy begs for attention while David remains fixed on his work. Meanwhile, the lazy locals that have been hired to complete work on the house have taken a notice to Amy's liberated feminism, and their incendiary behavior finally causes David to snap into a rage of primal violence and retribution.Sam Peckinpah continues to break the mold of classic cinema in STRAW DOGS, which has been both hailed and criticized for its extreme depictions of rape and violence. These arguments are not entirely unfounded, when the film features an ambiguous rape sequence that has long been the source of controversy. In addition to Peckinpah's depictions of male savagery, STRAW DOGS would seem to lend itself to a misogynistic interpretation of events. A surface level reaction such as this only serves to discredit the carefully crafted characters, growing tension, and psychological breakdown that the film represents.From the opening scenes, STRAW DOGS maintains a constant sense of unease that continues to build until the thrilling climax. This is can be seen in every single element of the film, from the key editing to the ways the characters interact with each other and through to the specific sights and sounds that Peckinpah chooses to include in order to keep his viewer on the knife's edge. There are countless exchanges and dynamics that must be examined to fully appreciate the complex psychology behind the plot. On one level, Peckinpah deconstructs the marital problems between his lead characters, problems which manifest in subtle and not so subtle ways on screen. Then there is the recurring theme of courage and what it means to be a man, which is constantly reproached both in David and Amy's arguments and in the way that David chooses to defend himself when facing the boorish thugs.Dustin Hoffman and Susan George are each brilliant in their own unique ways. They are entirely believable as a young married couple, despite their many differences. Hoffman is timid and awkward throughout most of the picture, but there are slight cracks that occur mainly after Amy has pushed his buttons that will foreshadow his hidden aggression. George is given perhaps the most complex role as Amy. With David, she is playful and needing of attention, and often portrays the character as a naive schoolgirl. Things change as she becomes the object of desire for the workmen, where she puts up a callous front as the strong and defiant modern woman. During the notorious rape scene, she struggles with her own faithfulness and sexual desires, having been pushed aside and ignored by David for so long. This scene should not be interpreted as her submittal to the rape, but rather to her own wants. Her horrified reaction when Scutt joins in shows a shift to her true objection and violation. Although she constantly berates David for being a coward, we find in the end that she is the more fearful and hesitant of the two.STRAW DOGS unleashes a raw and gritty violence that is unrelenting and unforgiving once the events unfold in the end. Peckinpah holds nothing back, and puts all of the graphic scenes on full display. This is, again, a major point of dispute for many film critics, who conclude that Peckinpah looks to exploit the bloody action. If this were the case, the struggle between the Sumners and their aggressors would have occurred much earlier on in the picture. Instead, Peckinpah takes a much more timely approach to the violence, and the final assault on the home becomes a metaphor for David's collapsing psyche. It is extreme, yes, but this is in direct contrast to the bloodless first and second acts.As far as story and character development are concerned, STRAW DOGS outperforms any other film about rape and revenge. It marks a tremendous shift in movie making as a whole, and is considered by many to be Sam Peckinpah's greatest work.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",5,Straw Dogs,1300665600,"03 21, 2011",2011,4146,"['brilliant', 'apprehensive', 'mathematician', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'retreat', 'old', 'farmhouse', 'English', 'countryside', 'escape', 'political', 'strife', 'encountered', 'America', 'settling', 'new', 'home', 'marriage', 'falter', 'Amy', 'begs', 'attention', 'David', 'fixed', 'work', 'Meanwhile', 'lazy', 'locals', 'have', 'been', 'hired', 'complete', 'work', 'house', 'have', 'taken', 'notice', 'Amy', 'liberated', 'feminism', 'incendiary', 'behavior', 'finally', 'David', 'snap', 'rage', 'primal', 'violence', 'retribution.Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'break', 'mold', 'classic', 'cinema', 'STRAW', 'DOGS', 'been', 'hailed', 'criticized', 'extreme', 'depictions', 'rape', 'violence', 'arguments', 'are', 'not', 'entirely', 'unfounded', 'when', 'film', 'ambiguous', 'rape', 'sequence', 'long', 'been', 'source', 'controversy', 'addition', 'Peckinpah', 'depictions', 'male', 'savagery', 'STRAW', 'DOGS', 'would', 'seem', 'lend', 'misogynistic', 'interpretation', 'events', 'surface', 'level', 'reaction', 'such', 'only', 'discredit', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'characters', 'growing', 'tension', 'psychological', 'breakdown', 'film', 'opening', 'scenes', 'STRAW', 'DOGS', 'constant', 'sense', 'unease', 'build', 'thrilling', 'climax', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'single', 'element', 'film', 'key', 'editing', 'ways', 'characters', 'interact', 'other', 'specific', 'sights', 'Peckinpah', 'include', 'order', 'keep', 'viewer', 'knife', 'edge', 'are', 'countless', 'exchanges', 'dynamics', 'must', 'be', 'examined', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'complex', 'psychology', 'plot', 'one', 'level', 'Peckinpah', 'marital', 'problems', 'lead', 'characters', 'problems', 'manifest', 'subtle', 'not', 'so', 'subtle', 'ways', 'screen', 'Then', 'recurring', 'theme', 'courage', 'what', 'be', 'man', 'constantly', 'reproached', 'David', 'Amy', 'arguments', 'way', 'David', 'defend', 'when', 'facing', 'boorish', 'thugs.Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Susan', 'George', 'are', 'brilliant', 'own', 'unique', 'ways', 'are', 'entirely', 'believable', 'young', 'married', 'couple', 'many', 'differences', 'Hoffman', 'timid', 'awkward', 'most', 'picture', 'are', 'slight', 'cracks', 'occur', 'mainly', 'Amy', 'pushed', 'buttons', 'will', 'foreshadow', 'hidden', 'aggression', 'George', 'given', 'perhaps', 'most', 'complex', 'role', 'Amy', 'David', 'playful', 'needing', 'attention', 'often', 'character', 'naive', 'schoolgirl', 'Things', 'change', 'object', 'desire', 'workmen', 'where', 'up', 'callous', 'front', 'strong', 'defiant', 'modern', 'woman', 'notorious', 'rape', 'scene', 'own', 'faithfulness', 'sexual', 'desires', 'having', 'been', 'pushed', 'aside', 'ignored', 'David', 'so', 'long', 'scene', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'interpreted', 'submittal', 'rape', 'rather', 'own', 'horrified', 'reaction', 'when', 'Scutt', 'shows', 'shift', 'true', 'objection', 'violation', 'constantly', 'David', 'being', 'coward', 'find', 'end', 'more', 'fearful', 'hesitant', 'two.STRAW', 'DOGS', 'raw', 'gritty', 'violence', 'unrelenting', 'unforgiving', 'once', 'events', 'unfold', 'end', 'Peckinpah', 'nothing', 'back', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'full', 'display', 'again', 'major', 'point', 'dispute', 'many', 'film', 'critics', 'who', 'conclude', 'Peckinpah', 'exploit', 'bloody', 'action', 'were', 'case', 'struggle', 'Sumners', 'aggressors', 'would', 'have', 'occurred', 'much', 'earlier', 'picture', 'Instead', 'Peckinpah', 'much', 'more', 'timely', 'approach', 'violence', 'final', 'assault', 'home', 'metaphor', 'David', 'collapsing', 'psyche', 'extreme', 'yes', 'direct', 'contrast', 'bloodless', 'first', 'second', 'acts.As', 'far', 'story', 'character', 'development', 'are', 'concerned', 'STRAW', 'DOGS', 'other', 'film', 'rape', 'revenge', 'tremendous', 'shift', 'movie', 'making', 'whole', 'considered', 'many', 'be', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'greatest', 'work.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",Straw Dogs VHS
229885,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6300251217,C. O. DeRiemer,"[1, 4]","This movie represents much of the things that made Peckinpah such a conflicted director. The theme of the movie, for me, had nothing to do with the turning of a worm, but was all about Peckinpah's own love for violence as a way of giving the finger to everyone he thought was a lackey or conventional or just not macho enough.Peckinpah made, in my opinion, one classic movie, The Wild Bunch. There was violence, but this was overshadowed by the development of character and the sadness of age and changing times. Cable Hogue and Ride the High Country are both, in my opinion, very good, and in both Peckinpah showed self-discipline. But Straw Dogs, for me, is just violence to make a point that somewhere in Peckinpah's psyche it seemed important to make. He liked to push the envelope, as the cliche has it, and if people got a few paper cuts on their tongues, so much the better.The casting also is a problem for me. Dustin Hoffman might be a very good actor, but he was sure lucky that he made The Graduate and Midnight Cowboy. He hit the moment in the late Sixties when pretty-boy heros were fast going out of fashion and the anti-hero was coming in. I'm convinced that if Hoffman had emerged in the Fifties or the Eighties, he would have remained an outstanding but unsung character actor. For me, it is unbelievable that Susan George would ever have considered him mating material. When this movie was made, Hoffman was big stuff in Hollywood and he and Peckinpah were probably delighted to get each other.",3,Peckinpah Was Capable of So Much Better,1098662400,"10 25, 2004",2004,1512,"['movie', 'much', 'things', 'made', 'Peckinpah', 'conflicted', 'director', 'theme', 'movie', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'turning', 'worm', 'was', 'Peckinpah', 'own', 'love', 'violence', 'way', 'giving', 'finger', 'everyone', 'thought', 'was', 'lackey', 'conventional', 'just', 'not', 'macho', 'enough.Peckinpah', 'made', 'opinion', 'one', 'classic', 'movie', 'Wild', 'Bunch', 'was', 'violence', 'was', 'overshadowed', 'development', 'character', 'sadness', 'age', 'changing', 'times', 'Cable', 'Hogue', 'Ride', 'High', 'Country', 'are', 'opinion', 'very', 'good', 'Peckinpah', 'showed', 'self-discipline', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'just', 'violence', 'make', 'point', 'somewhere', 'Peckinpah', 'psyche', 'seemed', 'important', 'make', 'liked', 'push', 'envelope', 'cliche', 'people', 'got', 'few', 'paper', 'cuts', 'tongues', 'so', 'much', 'better.The', 'casting', 'also', 'problem', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'might', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'actor', 'was', 'sure', 'lucky', 'made', 'Graduate', 'Midnight', 'Cowboy', 'hit', 'moment', 'late', 'Sixties', 'when', 'pretty-boy', 'heros', 'were', 'fast', 'going', 'fashion', 'anti-hero', 'was', 'coming', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'Hoffman', 'had', 'emerged', 'Fifties', 'Eighties', 'would', 'have', 'remained', 'outstanding', 'unsung', 'character', 'actor', 'unbelievable', 'Susan', 'George', 'would', 'ever', 'have', 'considered', 'mating', 'material', 'When', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'Hoffman', 'was', 'big', 'stuff', 'Hollywood', 'Peckinpah', 'were', 'probably', 'delighted', 'get', 'other']",Straw Dogs VHS

The film filmed in England and banned there due to excessive violence was released at a time when this type of film action was starting to be in vogue.Hoffman and his flirtatious and comely wife Amy played by Susan George go on retreat to the farmhouse she grew up in in the Cornwall countryside.  Looking for solitude to complete his research he hires some locals to complete some repairs of the house.  Sensing his cowardice they become abusive and intimidating which culiminates in a brutal rape scene of George, the main reason for the banning of the film.George keeps the incident from Hoffman but when he accidently strikes local pervert Henry Niles played by David Warner on a foggy night with his car he feels responsible.  He offers him shelter in the farmhouse not knowing that Warner had accidently just strangled a local girl.  Her father the alcoholic Tom played by Peter Vaughn and the abusive locals arrive on the scene to extirpate him from the farmhouse.Hoffman seeking to protect Warner and George morphs into a merciless warrior defending his turf in a segment festooned with violence as he proceeds to bloodily dispatch the group trying to gain entrance to the house.Peckinpah's penchant for the display of violence in his film was demonstrated quite vividly in ""Straw Dogs"".

229887,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,6300251217,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[4, 19]","If there has ever been a more over-interpreted and stolidly misinterpreted film than director Sam Peckinpah's 1971 Straw Dogs, I've yet to encounter it. Yes, films like Citizen Kane and 2001: A Space Odyssey have had more ink spilled over them, but most of the ideas tossed about are on the money, and far less is read into them. Also, they have one big thing going for them that Straw Dogs does not. They are great films. While Straw Dogs is not nearly as good a film as its hagiographers claim- for Peckinpah had all the subtlety and psychological depth of a sledgehammer, nor is it as irredeemable a bit of pornography as it detractors insist, it is, above all, a very dull and mediocre film. This is not a word- dull, that has likely ever appeared in a review of the film, but what else can one call a film that telegraphs its end in the first twenty minutes, and has all the realistic character development of a Warner Brothers Roadrunner cartoon? Excuse me: let me rescind that. Wile E. Coyote, at least, plumbs some true existential angst.By contrast, the nearly two hour long Straw Dogs is not even that innovative and certainly not `naturalistic,' for the ultra-violence it depicts was done better (and strangely, even more realistically) in Stanley Kubrick's deeper and darker humored A Clockwork Orange- released the same year, and earlier by Peckinpah, in The Wild Bunch, by Arthur Penn, in Bonnie And Clyde; its scenes of cretins trying to break into the lead characters' home are pale echoes of George Romero's masterful low budget Night Of the Living Dead, and even the Vincent Price horror classic, The Last Man On Earth (and it's remake, the Charlton Heston vehicle The Omega Man); and the revenge theme done more engagingly in Wes Craven's campy debut film Last House On The Left- sans the guilty pleasure, and more deeply in the film Craven was inspired by, Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring. It acted, however, as a springboard for other films showing increasingly stylized violence, such as Deliverance (1972), Death Wish (1974), and Taxi Driver (1976)- films with different styles and artistic merits. As well, the film's politics and psychology are badly dated. This is especially true in the infamous `double rape' scene. Compared to Alfred Hitchcock's Frenzy, released a few months later, Peckinpah's motivations seem downright silly, which is especially noteworthy since Hitchcock built a career on Freudian pseudoscientific motivations for his criminal characters, yet abandoned that all for realism in his underappreciated 1972 gem.... In short, being controversial does not always equate with quality, and Straw Dogs seems more and more like a puerile attempt to simply shock (which it no longer even does), yet one with pretensions of something deeper- it is an ok B film with a better pedigreed director and A film production values. Ironically, that very lack of pretense is why a film like Last House On The Left works better, and a film like Night Of The Living Dead touches far deeper into the human psyche and far richer into true art. Shock filmmaker David Fincher (Fight Club), a manifest Peckinpah acolyte, once said, `I'm always interested in movies that scar. The thing I love about Jaws is the fact that I've never gone swimming in the ocean again.' Well, aside from his love of a rather routine and trite Steven Spielberg thriller (though the director seems to have gone all downhill since then), Fincher's dictum is not met here, for even the controversy of the alleged `double rape' and the violent ending seem, nowadays, to be much ado over very little, as not a single image sticks out in viewers' minds, not even the film's blurred opening of kids in a playground, which quotes Peckinpah's earlier The Wild Bunch. When an artist cannot even equal his earlier glories it's a sure sign of a lesser work of art.

229889,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,6300251217,DanD,"[6, 8]","Sam Peckinpah's STRAW DOGS is one of those movies that polarizes its audience in various ways: it's blatantly violent; it's incredibly slow-paced; it's so realistic as to seem lazy; it's nihilistic and incredibly down-beat.  Almost everything about it is predisposed to controversy, which is arguably what makes it such a brilliant examination of the violence within.David Sumner has come to England to live in his wife Amy's hometown.  Immediately he recognizes his outsider status; the locals don't take kindly to him, and David for his part thinks himself superior.  This leads to tensions building between the Sumners and the townspeople, enhanced by the fact that one of the agitators was once Amy's lover.The fires in the film burn slowly, but when they reach their peak, they are massive.  It's an eruption of violence, much of it almost unwatchable, yet Peckinpah injects enough humanity--easily mistaken for sexism and egoism, perhaps--into all of it that you can't help but look away.  As David and Amy, Dustin Hoffman and Susan George have dynamic, realistic chemistry--their love is palpable, and so are their fights, and the slow disintegration of their marriage makes complete sense given the context.  The violence that ultimately ensues is not over-the-top, really; it's just awful to watch because it hits close to home.  What Peckinpah is suggesting is that every one of us is capable of discovering something new, and that we may not always like what we find.The Blu-ray (which I'm reviewing) is a mixed blessing.  It's nice to have the film available again (remakes are good for something, I guess), and it looks/sounds fantastic (sound, indeed, is a big deal here, especially in the brilliant climactic scene).  However, there are no bonus features aside from ""TV Spots"" and ""Theatrical Trailer"" (which sounded so mundane I didn't even check them out).  A making-of, tribute piece, or even a bit on Peckinpah himself (as we got with THE WILD BUNCH, a brilliant documentary narrated by Kris Kristofferson) would have been a nice addition.  As is, we get to judge the film on its own merits (as it should be), but the package is a little too bare-bones for the price tag.Make no mistake: STRAW DOGS is not for everyone.  Many will be bored; many will be appalled.  But if you are unafraid of films that examine the human condition, that take their time to make a frightening point, then this film is a must see.  If nothing else, it proves that Chekhov's old adage about a gun in the first act also applies to bear traps.

""Daniel""","[2, 3]","It's a fascinating pleasure to discover little by little and scene after scene the western hidden behind the contemporary tragedy described by STRAW DOGS. Director Sam Peckinpah plays a subtle game with us by titillating our  memories and our love for movies. Firstly, the different spots where the  action takes place should ring a bell in each one of us : for example, just  imagine the pub's customers with stetsons and jeans and you will see in  front of you a saloon with the sheriff, the barman and the usual bad  boys.Maybe, in certain scenes of STRAW DOGS, like the attack of Dustin  Hofmann's house -very FORT APACHE or RIO BRAVO like- or the description of  the lynchers of Charlie, the codes Hollywood directors used during 50 years  in thousands of westerns are more manifest. Anyway, we have understood that  Sam Peckinpah wants us to watch STRAW DOGS not only in the first  degree.So, the scene of Susan George's rape should not have created so  much anger in our beloved critics. I sincerely think that, for most of us,  it's impossible to identify ourselves with the rapists. Sam Peckinpah,  before this crucial scene, has patiently described these drunken stupid  guys with their libidos hanging from their tongues and their below-average  intellectual level. Now, it must also be admitted that Sam Peckinpah isn't  an admirer of women's characters, at least in his movies, and that the  three women of STRAW DOGS do not specially give a rewarding image of our  beloved partners.

229892,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6300251217,David Baldwin,"[2, 4]","Despite it's reputation for being gratuitously violent, ""Straw Dogs"" isn't really.  The film, until it's climax, forbodes violence which in many ways is more chilling than the act of violence itself.  The film concerns itself with a pacifist mathematician, David Sumner(Dustin Hoffman) who moves with his youngish British wife, Amy(Susan George)to the Cornish village from where Amy was reared.  Sumner is met with immediate resentment by a segment of the town's populace particularly from a group of laborers who Sumner has hired to fix up his cottage.  In the meantime, it is apparent that the marriage between the Sumner's is somewhat rocky and not without tension of it's own.  This lethal mix has all the earmarks of a combustible explosion and does it ever.  The more popular reading of this film is that when the most passive of men are confronted with a violation against themselves or their property they will react in kind to protect themselves.  However, on the film's commentary track, film scholar Stephen Prince has a different interpretation for Sumner's behaviour.  This is one of the better scholastic commentarys I've heard so anybody who has already seen ""Straw Dogs"" would be advised to play the DVD with it on.  As for the performances, Hoffman is excellent as Sumner but the real revelation here is Susan George as the woman-child Amy.  Prince in his commentary picks up on the complexity of George's performance that I had not picked up on in my initial viewings of this film.

Hartley,"[6, 9]","A key film in launching the &quot;Death Wish&quot; era,&quot;Straw Dogs&quot; nonetheless deals with its subject in a much more thoughtful manner than subsequent formula pics of the genre. Dustin Hoffman is in top form as the nebbishy urban American who moves to the native countryside of his English-born wife,shagadelic 70's sex kitten Susan George. Sam Peckinpah quickly precedes to take this &quot;Green Acres&quot; scenario and turn it into &quot;Village of the Damned&quot;. This sleepy little hamlet claims an inordinate number of inbred thugs as residents, including several who appear to share a seedy history with Hoffman's bride. The resulting intimidations and confrontations escalate to the inevitable, much-discussed &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;-ish baptism of blood finale.

She is a beautiful and sexy blonde who all the rural lads remember from her youth and they are all jealous of Dustin Hoffman who is the American who has won her. Susan George and Dustin Hoffman seem a hopeless mismatch and she seems to know it before he does. She is just an English country girl and she resents that he is trying to make her in to a female version of himself, ie a more intellectual, responsiblespectacle wearing chess player. What she has that he underestimates the worth of is sensual appeal. And when he doesn't pay attention she advertises to any man near by just to prove she has it.The way Peckinpah sets up the Hoffman/George relationship it is almost assured to lead to trouble. Instead of having Hoffman and George fight it out between themselves Peckinpah has them wage their war through the hired hands which are little more than hoods recognizing the opportunities when they present themselves.George has a past with one of the lads and she does not exactly resist his advances and this is just more proof that things are not all well in her marriage. Though things go much much further than she had perhaps anticipated.The atmosphere of the movie is great. The village is tiny, just a pub and a few houses. And the stone English country house that Hoffman and George rent for the year is like a small castle and decorated with weapons. The final confrontation is country manor warfare at its most intense. The final result is cathartic but feels more like an exhilerated confusion than a clear resolution.Acting wise Hoffman is magnificent but George is also great displaying a wide range of moods and motivations.Other movies have shown more violence than this one but still the violence in this one is of a very particular type, the type that Peckinpah suggests is seething below the surface of many man/woman relationships.

She has lost her civility now that she is back on her home turf (a real irony since they came from the USA, where we are so much more barbaric than our UK bretheren).  Only when the constable is killed and you really feel that all hope is truly lost does Dustin hop into action.  And he really takes over and &quot;proves&quot; that he is a real man.

229906,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,6300251217,Erik North,"[13, 17]","The first contemporary film made by Sam Peckinpah, whose five previous movies were all westerns, STRAW DOGS, in its study of how one seemingly mild-mannered man (in this case Dustin Hoffman) can be driven to defend himself through extreme violence, can, in my belief, be classified as a sociological and psychological horror film.Released in late 1971, at the same time as Stanley Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, STRAW DOGS caused an enormous amount of debate on both sides of the Atlantic concerning not only its violence, but also the horrific rape scene involving Hoffman's wife (Susan George), which got the film banned in England, where Peckinpah made it.  Both Kubrick's and Peckinpah's films differ from each other, in that Kubrick's is a more political allegory and Peckinpah's is philosophical--and yet both films are, in their own ways, masterpieces.Peckinpah, in a stroke of pure genius, with the exception of the hideous rape scene, holds off on his typical slow-motion violence until the climactic siege, where Hoffman has to protect a mental patient (David Warner) from a band of drunk hooligans.  This sequence is still nerve-shattering and violent, brilliantly edited, shot, and acted, with Peter Vaughan making for one of the most frightening heavies ever.Besides the acting, the other fine points of STRAW DOGS are the ominous cinematography of John Coquillon, who also shot the low-budget 1968 British horror film THE WITCHFINDER GENERAL, and a brilliantly haunting Stravinsky/Herrmann-influenced music score by Peckinpah's favorite composer Jerry Fielding.

Do you remember how I left you alone in the house to take the crazy guy home and forget all about that guy who only had a bit of his foot blown off and so was probably still alive and dangerous? I think they call it a plot hole, sugar. Say, this pasta is great."" Mind you, their relationship would have been hard pressed to have survived all that, so grandchildren would have been an unlikely prospect.This film sticks out like a sore thumb even for the Seventies. There's no film quite like it. Incredibly, it has only just been cleared in the UK by the film classification board after years of banning despite once being freely available. I have a video copy. I'm embarrassed to report that the board consultated a couple of psychologists as to whether they thought the rape scene might be harmful to the public. I love democracy, don't you? An un-elected body consulting a profession that can't even agree if there is such a thing as personality disorder or an Oedipus complex to decide for millions what they can and can't see certainly takes the proverbial dog biscuit. Luckily for us, quack central past the scene as not harmful. Yes, but what if you already have a personality disorder? Still, you can now speculate about the notorious scene for yourself, soon. Was she faking it because she feared for her life? Did she have split loyalties right from the start? Gosh, I'm not touching it with a bargepole. The film, I mean. No, that's cowardly. Basically, when confronted by a bully you have two options, one of which is appeasement. Amy takes this option and is then taught a traumatic lesson. Still not willing to confront the lesson she attempts to repeat her mistake until her husband stops her and spells out what would happen to the pair of them if she carries out this option. Only when finally forced to take up arms does she qualitively learn. Is this the only way ultimately to deal with terrorists? There's little doubting the director's perspective, but what's yours?The atmosphere of Straw Dogs is horrible from the start. I rarely watch it because of this. The editing is brilliant, the script strong and it lacks that distancing effect you get with most films. It is uncomfortably real. Should this have been the film to be titled THE OMEN? The brother grabbing his sister by the neck as they watch the couple in the cottage get into bed. The trap nearly springing on Charlie as the workmen try to put it on the cottage wall.

It's true, as others have noted, that what was so shocking in '71 seems pretty much par for the course by today's standards (though I still wouldn't call it &quot;tame&quot; exactly). At the time, it certainly seemed like a blow to the peace and love ethic of the 60s.As a visceral experience, the movie retains quite a bit of power.

There is a brooding under-current of potential menace almost from the start. The young wife is becoming disillusioned because her husband is wrapped up in his mathematical research work. ""I need to be left alone!"" he declares. She needs him; his love, his attention. Local men are repairing the roof to the garage. They see her in her mini skirt and bra-less sweater and think their lecherous thoughts. She passes an open window to the bathroom, opposite where the workmen are and can see clearly. She has removed her sweater (in preparation for the bath) and stands for seconds, topless, looking at them. Is she wanting the thrill of `being seen'? She certainly wants attention. Eventually she gets it. Her husband is lured to a day of shooting ducks. While away, one former friend knocks on her door. She offers him a drink. He makes a pass. She asks him to leave. He tries to kiss her. She slaps him. He slaps her back. Her hair is pulled as she is dragged to the sofa, rape ensues, where she protests then takes him for the `attention' she wants. As it ends, another lecher has entered the room and been watching. The sordid business is repeated, this time with no allusion to fleeting tenderness. The rest of the film descends further into simple violence. This was controversial when first released (at a similar time and with a similar reaction to Clockwork Orange). This is not for the faint-hearted.

229915,A2BLITJITO97N5,6300251217,Ingalls,"[0, 0]","One of the most violent films ever, director Peckinpah tried to tell a pagan tale about a wimpy man who is finally moved to violence against invaders when he realizes a primordial instinct to defend his home. As a violent, stomach-churning, nauseating (and this is a very unpleasant film to watch - not merely scary, but sickening)  roller coaster ride, this succeeds. As a film, it fails. What's wrong here? 1) The film is poorly paced. Poor editing could have helped here.  2) Dustin Hoffman is all wrong for the part of the wimpy husband. Yes, he's a nerdy little guy - but he never convinces when the transformation takes place and the character gets in touch with his primitive violent side. 3) Susan George is too beautiful to play the part of a nerdy mathematician's wife. She looks like a Playboy bunny - and like a woman who would have no interest sexually in mathematician/squirt of a man David Sumner, never mind marry him. 4) Some parts of the film make absolutely no sense. At the end of the film, Hoffman drives the mentally deranged Niles to his home?!! Niles just killed a girl and attempted to kill Hoffman's character's wife. Why is Hoffman not driving him to a police station? 5) The excuse for keeping a bear trap in the home is that the wife collects traps??!! Huh?? Give me a break. The only thing the wife collects is men.There's a lot of excitement here - once the violence begins, it is not only relentless, it escalates to a fever pitch. But this may leave a sickening feeling in your gut - it did mine. If Peckinpah's intention was to show how man can be reduced to violence because it is still a part of his primitive nature and ready to be unleashed when needed, he confuses the issue with his almost voyeuristic portrayal of rape. Is this anthropology or torture porn?

229916,A19JYLHD94K94D,6300251217,Itamar Katz,"[7, 8]","Sam Pecknpah followed his extremely violent and critically acclaimed 'The Wild Bunch' with the even more violent 'Straw Dogs', which didn't sit as well with the critics; in fact, 'Straw Dogs' was shocking enough to be banned in the UK where it was filmed, although in the US it was released with an X rating. Critics attacked it as being overtly violent and sexual, and entirely missed the message Peckinpah was making. Three and a half decades later, though, it's easier to appreciate 'Straw Dogs' for the groundbreaking creation that it was, and its influence can clearly be seen in the works of such contemporary directors as David Fincher, David Lynch and Todd Solondz, among others.With hindsight, it's hard to miss the fact that the sexual and violent content of 'Straw Dogs' isn't a whole lot more shocking than that of Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange', released that very same month. 'A Clockwork Orange' also created its own share of controversy, of course; yet somehow it was more rapidly recognized as the masterpiece it is by critics than 'Straw Dogs'. In part, I think that's due to the fact that while 'A Clockwork Orange' is an ultra-violent surreal fantasy from its very beginning, 'Straw Dogs' seems entirely innocent at first, like a very realistic and light-hearted drama, and the violence builds gradually throughout the film. That sense of realism, which 'A Clockwork Orange' never pretends to, makes 'Straw Dogs' much more difficult to take as an analogy; it cries out to be taken at face value, which makes it much more difficult to swallow.Dustin Hoffman was never an actor to fear controversy, and 'Straw Dogs' catches him right at the peak of his best years as an actor, after 'The Graduate', 'Midnight Cowboy' and 'Little Big Man', and before 'Lenny', 'Papillon' and 'All The President's Men'. His performance is as amazing as in any of these, and again Hoffman proves his rare range, as well as his sensitivity; his performance carries the film to true excellence, and perhaps that's the other reason that the film was a bit more difficult to take than 'A Clockwork Orange' - to take nothing away from the wonderful Malcolm McDowell, what 'A Clockwork Orange' simply didn't have was a protagonist for the viewer to identify with, and therefore, like I stated before, it was easier to take as an analogy, and Alex functioned more as a symbolic and iconic character than as a real human being. David Sumner, on the other hand, is a remarkably realistic and convincing character, and one that is very easy to relate to, which makes the change that comes over him towards the end of the film all the more shocking. Again, it is that building up of tension that makes 'Straw Dogs' such a powerful experience.'Straw Dogs' is a film that creates controversy and disagreements, and so it should. It's easy to create controversy with sex and violence; but many years later that initial shock fades, and the real test is whether or not the film stands the trial of time and still manages to shock and engross. Like 'A Clockwork Orange', 'Straw Dogs' stands that test. Love it or hate it, it's hard to deny that it's an important and influential film, and it's essential viewing for any film lover.",5,Years ahead of its time,1140220800,"02 18, 2006",2006,3213,"['Sam', 'Pecknpah', 'followed', 'extremely', 'violent', 'critically', 'acclaimed', ""'The"", 'Wild', 'Bunch', 'even', 'more', 'violent', ""'Straw"", 'Dogs', 'did', ""n't"", 'sit', 'as', 'well', 'critics', 'fact', 'Dogs', 'was', 'shocking', 'enough', 'be', 'banned', 'UK', 'where', 'was', 'filmed', 'US', 'was', 'released', 'X', 'rating', 'Critics', 'attacked', 'being', 'overtly', 'violent', 'sexual', 'entirely', 'missed', 'message', 'Peckinpah', 'was', 'making', 'Three', 'half', 'decades', 'later', 'easier', 'appreciate', ""'Straw"", 'Dogs', 'groundbreaking', 'creation', 'was', 'influence', 'can', 'clearly', 'be', 'seen', 'works', 'such', 'contemporary', 'directors', 'David', 'Fincher', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'others.With', 'hindsight', 'hard', 'miss', 'fact', 'sexual', 'violent', 'content', ""'Straw"", 'Dogs', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'shocking', 'Kubrick', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'released', 'very', 'same', 'month', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'also', 'created', 'own', 'share', 'controversy', 'course', 'somehow', 'was', 'more', 'rapidly', 'recognized', 'masterpiece', 'critics', ""'Straw"", 'Dogs', 'part', 'think', 'due', 'fact', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'ultra-violent', 'surreal', 'fantasy', 'very', 'beginning', ""'Straw"", 'Dogs', 'entirely', 'innocent', 'first', 'very', 'realistic', 'light-hearted', 'drama', 'violence', 'gradually', 'film', 'sense', 'realism', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'never', ""'Straw"", 'Dogs', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'take', 'analogy', 'out', 'be', 'taken', 'face', 'value', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'swallow.Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'was', 'never', 'actor', 'fear', 'controversy', ""'Straw"", 'Dogs', 'catches', 'right', 'peak', 'best', 'years', 'actor', ""'The"", 'Graduate', 'Cowboy', ""'Little"", 'Big', 'Man', ""'Lenny"", ""'Papillon"", 'President', 'Men', 'performance', 'as', 'amazing', 'again', 'Hoffman', 'rare', 'range', 'as', 'well', 'sensitivity', 'performance', 'film', 'true', 'excellence', 'perhaps', 'other', 'reason', 'film', 'was', 'bit', 'more', 'difficult', 'take', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'take', 'nothing', 'away', 'wonderful', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'what', ""'"", 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'was', 'protagonist', 'viewer', 'identify', 'therefore', 'stated', 'was', 'easier', 'take', 'analogy', 'Alex', 'functioned', 'more', 'symbolic', 'iconic', 'character', 'real', 'human', 'being', 'David', 'Sumner', 'other', 'hand', 'remarkably', 'realistic', 'convincing', 'character', 'one', 'very', 'easy', 'relate', 'change', 'end', 'film', 'more', 'shocking', 'Again', 'building', 'tension', ""'Straw"", 'Dogs', 'such', 'powerful', 'experience', ""'Straw"", 'Dogs', 'film', 'controversy', 'disagreements', 'should', 'easy', 'create', 'controversy', 'sex', 'violence', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'initial', 'shock', 'fades', 'real', 'test', 'not', 'film', 'trial', 'time', 'still', 'shock', 'engross', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', ""'Straw"", 'Dogs', 'stands', 'test', 'Love', 'hate', 'hard', 'deny', 'important', 'influential', 'film', 'essential', 'viewing', 'film', 'lover']",Straw Dogs VHS

In this film he has a delicate role and he is learning the trade. He has to be both a mathematician immersed in his maths and a husband reacting to his wife's feeling of insecurity. When the local neighbours become aggressive, killing their cat and hanging it in their closet, then raping the wife, then attacking them at night because they are harbouring the local simpleton who was going to be lynched by the villagers, the father of the girl who had provoked him at the head of them with a fire-gun, he loses his calm and yet keeps his head. That makes an explosive cocktail that brings the local ""authority"" down dead, and then all the members of the lynching gang down dead or not far from it. Of course the beautiful renovated Irish farm does not have one window left and has suffered heavy damage. But the scientist-husband has managed to have the last word with these drunk hooligans and also with his wife, though she never said two of them raped her in the afternoon. But she is the one who uses a lying-about gun to kill the last assailant. She finally finds some courage instead of waiting for her dear husband to do it in her place. The film is quite bizarre though because it seems to show the Irish as being more or less whisky-bags or beer-bags, if we can use these words, and at the same time, the American wife is vain and seems to believe that her being married is going to make these men forget she had been mooching around with them during her vacations before being married. The American husband is both an intellectual engrossed in his own thinking, easily fooled by these locals who take him on an expedition hunting the snark on the heath, and an extremely cold-thinking defender of his home and wife, as well as of simple principles that make lynching an out of question solution to any situation.

229921,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,6300251217,Jeffrey Leach,"[13, 15]","I remember hearing Charlton Heston once remark about Sam Peckinpah that the man had a great career and vision but then sadly &quot;started blowing off heads.&quot; Heston may be right in his analysis of Peckinpah's dedication to dramatic violence, as one need look no further than the closing sequences of the seminal &quot;Wild Bunch&quot; to see a death toll of truly shocking proportions. This director's proclivity for bloody violence, usually shown in slow motion to ratchet up the effect, doesn't find as much expression in the 1971 psychological thriller &quot;Straw Dogs.&quot; There are a few nasty encounters with a shotgun peppered throughout the final twenty or thirty minutes of this atmospheric picture, but nary a head leaves its shoulders here. Starring Dustin Hoffman, a few years after his stint in &quot;The Graduate,&quot; and a fresh-faced Susan George, &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; spends more time setting up a pervasive sense of doom than concerning itself with a huge body count. Actually, this movie's restraint is surprising for a Peckinpah picture. Then again, I haven't seen a lot of Sammy's films, so perhaps this movie falls into a period when the director felt a need for moderation.David Sumner (Hoffman) and his British wife Amy (George) decide to rent a cottage in England while David works on writing a book. The village the two decide to live in has intimate connections with Amy Sumner, who lived there before meeting and marrying the bookish David. A gang of local thugs, who the Sumners hire to repair the roof of the cottage's barn, well remembers Amy. One of the guys actually had a relationship with this mouthy woman, a link that bodes ill for the amiable but wimpy David. Even worse, the goons have the support of the primary troublemaker in town, a man who even the local constable tiptoes around. The Brits resent David's slightly arrogant manner, his nerdy appearance, and the fact that he goes home with one of their own every night. Disrespect for David takes mild forms at first, usually in the form of funny looks or comments muttered under the breath, but soon the tension between the men and the Sumners escalates into the murder of a pet cat and intimidation on the road leading into the village. David rationalizes away the threats by stating that the problem will simply &quot;go away&quot; if he ignores it. His wife, who seems to know more about how things work in town, urges David to confront the local men. The tension becomes palpable as Sumner must deal not only with the hostility of the local populace but with his wife's strident calls for action as well. It soon gets to the point where Amy questions David's manhood over his meek manners and sycophantic behavior.Things go from bad to worse when Amy's former boyfriend, who sees David's simpering personality as a sign of weakness, decides to reassert his claim to Amy. In a scene that led to a ban on the film in Great Britain for three decades, the gang lures David away from the house so Amy's former beau can pay her a visit. The subsequent scenes are tough to watch, not necessarily because of their brutality but due to Amy's response to part of the proceedings. Not until another goon steps in does Amy show great resistance to what has happened, leading a viewer to believe that David's wife actually encouraged this sleazy rendezvous. Peckinpah seems to want us to think so, since Amy casts aspersions on David's manhood immediately before this incident. Surprisingly, Amy's misfortune is not the final straw that breaks the dog's back. Instead, a local criminal accidentally kills a local girl affiliated with the same village dregs making David's life miserable. Subsequent events find David providing sanctuary for this criminal as the thugs lay siege to the Sumner cottage. The result: a meek, educated man regresses into an animal capable of incredible violence.&quot;Straw Dogs&quot; moves at a glacial pace as Peckinpah builds tension through the encounters between the Sumners and the locals. The performances are generally good, with Hoffman standing out as the harassed mathematician who wants to leave well enough alone and finish his work. David Warner, a personal favorite, does a good job as the mentally challenged criminal Henry Niles. Unfortunately, Warner doesn't appear onscreen as much as I would have liked. The thugs are, well, thugs. Susan George, on the other hand, grates as Amy Sumner. I hated her character, a woman who is quick to push David into confrontation, calls into question his manhood when he resists her efforts, and then essentially stands back in the end by letting him face the goons all by himself. Amy's reacquaintance with her former boyfriend creates a sense of ambiguity on the part of the viewer towards Amy Sumner: on one level, you hate her for &quot;enjoying&quot; the crime, but on the other hand you feel for her when things go further than she anticipated. But you feel sorry only to a point, and perhaps that is what Peckinpah intended. I cannot help but think this director created the Amy character in order to express a deep-seated misogyny.Overall, I liked &quot;Straw Dogs,&quot; but I wouldn't watch it again soon. I unfortunately watched the Anchor Bay DVD version, but a Criterion disc has since emerged sporting lots of extras that might shine a spotlight or two on the inner workings of the film. If you want to watch this picture, you should probably get that disc. Obviously, there won't be a Peckinpah commentary on the DVD (he's been dead for years), but Criterion does a good job with its releases.

229922,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,6300251217,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[5, 7]","This film is one of the best works of Sam Peckinpah this movie deals with the true humanitarian phenomena, human nature for sexual orientation and needs and the most human seduction and temptation. This movie thrills you from the start to the end and the most magnificent aspect of the movie is its ambiguity and confusing nature of climax. ""Straw Dogs"" is an intense thriller that shows what can happen when you push even the mildest mannered man too far.  In here, Dustin Hoffman plays a mathematician who temporarily moves to a house in a rural village in England with his wife, a former resident of the town, played by Susan George. The two withstand incessant needling from several of the townsfolk until George is raped and assaulted and Hoffman is pushed over the edge.Incidentally, right after watching this film I found a documentary on cable about filmmakers from the late '60s to late '70s and one of the directors profiled was Sam Peckinpah. I had always considered his films to be violent and vaguely shocking, which never surprised me, knowing that he was a hard-living maverick who did things his way - an element that is resplendent in most of his films. A brief mention of Straw Dogs was included in this documentary, where they described it as a ""sexist film"". There are obvious scenes in the film that could support this criticism, but I think that is overanalyzing the film with a political correctness that is out of place. While the two female characters are both victimized, Susan George also has her moments of empowerment. I may be a female, but I don't consider Peckinpah's tendency to make testosterone-driven films any more sexist than anything that Tarantino puts out, and I'm a big fan of his work as well. It's a dangerous line to draw when one labels a film due to what is *not* included in a film.What this film does contain is much more stellar - Hoffman is beyond incredible in this film. His character development is amazing to experience. One criticism of the film that I heard from a friend who saw it before me was that it ""dragged."" I couldn't disagree more. The development of the story until the extremely violent climax is a perfect pace because it made me feel like I was sitting in a dentist chair, knowing that this low boil could explode at any time. After the dust settles, the viewer is left to decide whether Hoffman's character made the right decision, and left to speculate on the ramifications of the choices made. This is by far one of the best films I've seen in recent months and from this director.",5,"A nerve-shredding, palm-sweating thriller.......and drama.",1193184000,"10 24, 2007",2007,2555,"['film', 'one', 'best', 'works', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'movie', 'true', 'humanitarian', 'phenomena', 'human', 'nature', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'needs', 'most', 'human', 'seduction', 'temptation', 'movie', 'start', 'end', 'most', 'magnificent', 'aspect', 'movie', 'ambiguity', 'confusing', 'nature', 'climax', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'intense', 'thriller', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'when', 'push', 'even', 'mildest', 'mannered', 'man', 'too', 'far', 'here', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'mathematician', 'who', 'temporarily', 'house', 'rural', 'village', 'England', 'wife', 'former', 'resident', 'town', 'played', 'Susan', 'George', 'two', 'withstand', 'incessant', 'needling', 'several', 'townsfolk', 'George', 'raped', 'assaulted', 'Hoffman', 'pushed', 'edge.Incidentally', 'right', 'watching', 'film', 'found', 'documentary', 'cable', 'filmmakers', 'late', ""'60s"", 'late', ""'70s"", 'one', 'directors', 'profiled', 'was', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'had', 'always', 'considered', 'films', 'be', 'violent', 'vaguely', 'shocking', 'never', 'surprised', 'knowing', 'was', 'hard-living', 'maverick', 'who', 'did', 'things', 'way', 'element', 'resplendent', 'most', 'films', 'brief', 'mention', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'was', 'included', 'documentary', 'where', 'described', 'sexist', 'film', 'are', 'obvious', 'scenes', 'film', 'could', 'support', 'criticism', 'think', 'overanalyzing', 'film', 'political', 'correctness', 'place', 'two', 'female', 'characters', 'are', 'victimized', 'Susan', 'George', 'also', 'moments', 'empowerment', 'may', 'be', 'female', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'Peckinpah', 'tendency', 'make', 'testosterone-driven', 'films', 'more', 'sexist', 'anything', 'Tarantino', 'out', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'dangerous', 'line', 'draw', 'when', 'one', 'film', 'due', 'what', '*not*', 'included', 'film.What', 'film', 'contain', 'much', 'more', 'stellar', 'Hoffman', 'incredible', 'film', 'character', 'development', 'amazing', 'experience', 'One', 'criticism', 'film', 'heard', 'friend', 'who', 'saw', 'was', 'dragged', 'could', ""n't"", 'disagree', 'more', 'development', 'story', 'extremely', 'violent', 'climax', 'perfect', 'pace', 'made', 'feel', 'was', 'sitting', 'dentist', 'chair', 'knowing', 'low', 'boil', 'could', 'explode', 'time', 'dust', 'settles', 'viewer', 'left', 'decide', 'Hoffman', 'character', 'made', 'right', 'decision', 'left', 'speculate', 'ramifications', 'choices', 'made', 'far', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'months', 'director']",Straw Dogs VHS
229923,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,6300251217,J from NY,"[2, 4]","Peckinpah's ""Straw Dogs"" has to be one of the most thoroughly unpleasant movies I've ever seen.  As film it is important in only one way: to what degree the notion of manhood is a cultural fiction and to what degree it has a very basic biological reality.  This will be the subject of endless debate, most of it taking place outside of film school.Force as an opponent of the ideal and vice-versa is the conflict at the center of this exercise in degradation, mistrust, embarassment, and any other hellish feeling you can imagine jacked to the maximum.  Dustin Hoffman does a fantastic job as the thoroughly emasculated David Sumner; in each scene up until the end you can really feel the reclusive, fearful, and completely testosterone-free nature of the man.  You can tell this is a more a sociological study via cinema than a movie meant to be believable: a man like this, steeped in his intellect to the behest of every other quality, would not be with a woman looking or acting like his wife, the unbelievably annoying and stupid Amy Sumner played achingly well by Susan George.  He'd probably be alone and have other intellectuals as friends, and she'd probably be bar hopping until she met and married one of the thugs who harass the two throughout the movie.  I think Peckinpah wanted everything stacked against David to see how he would eventually react, and a thoroughly unappealing female leading character was necessary.  Even his wife can't give him a break and feels disappointed in him because he isn't violent enough.Also, why the hell does he hire Charlie if he realizes from the get go that he was a former lover of Amy's?  When he sees him leaning over her in the car at the beginning, why doesn't he run out there and confront immediately?  Even the mousiest of men, in my experience, would have snapped long before this guy does.The rape scene is one of the most confusing and disturbing things I've ever seen in a movie, although I saw it coming. It isn't clear whether Amy wants Charlie to just make out with her or go farther.  It is even more disturbing when she says, after being slapped twice, ""hold me, hold me"" and behaves in a puzzling way indeed.  But it is a rape, plain and simple; yes, she did invite him in, yes, she did turn down his request to leave which seemed very sincere; but he used force when she clearly asks him to stop.  What finally puts the lid on any any indecisiveness about the scene is his friend brutally joining in.The scene in which the two attend the church function and the disaster ensues is among the most nail-biting sequences I've ever encountered in a film.  It is a la Hitchcock the whole way and leaves the already horrific situation open for a vista of horrifying possibilities--most of which come true, all except the death of Henry Niles, the handicapped man played brilliantly by David Warner.  The death of the teenage girl infatuated with him has some pretty obvious echoes of ""Frankenstein"", and works almost as effectively.The only likeable characters in this film are David Sumners and the aforementioned Niles.  The cop is decent enough but he's almost impotent as Hoffmann's character in dealing with these scumbags.  I have to admit I enjoyed the ending very much, particularly the only decent people in the film driving away together.  I would agree with Peckinpah (if this is what he is trying to say) that it took violence for David to become more of a man, but my question is, why?  Are these kind of things inevitable?  Not at all.  Has he committed some horrible crime by lacking the instinct which keeps inner city kids shooting at each other and people f**king each other up in barfights?  To that I would say no.

Michael Click,"[0, 7]","Falsely sold to audiences as the story of one man's personal redemption, ""Straw Dogs"" is instead an extremely misogynistic and distasteful excuse for filling up two hours worth of screen time with blood, breasts, and brutality.  The advertising campaign for this film claimed that director Sam Peckinpah set out to tell the tale of a cowardly pacifist (Dustin Hoffman) who finally gets a burst of testosterone and becomes a ""man"" when his home is threatened.Now that plot line might have made for an interesting and morally appealing film.  Instead, what Peckinpah has delivered is the tale of a man whose whole life is built around self-delusions: nothing about his world is as it seems.  The peaceful English town he lives in is actually a cesspool of violence and cruelty; his marriage is in reality a lie; his house is not the fortress he thinks it is.  And what is the main problem, the driving force behind all this dysfunction?  Well, women, of course.  His toothsome wife (Susan George) is actually a tramp who flashes her breasts at men she used to date and who are still trying to bed her.  When she gets raped, she says ""no"" at first, but soon enough, she starts enjoying it.  You know how women are (and yes, I'm being angrily sarcastic at Peckinpah's unconscionable use of that old cliche).  Naturally, she keeps this information from her husband.  And one of the young girls in the village?  Since Hoffman won't respond to her sexual advances, she instead approaches a simpleton who has a reputation for molesting young women, and tries to seduce him, which leads her father and his drunken friends to go on a murderous rampage when they can't find her.  (Naturally, this being a completely nihilistic film, we know she's dead, even though none of the characters in the film know it.)The whole mess ends in the handful of drunken village men assaulting Hoffman's Home Sweet Home as if the Frankenstein monster were hiding inside.  And Hoffman takes on the invaders and, well ... far be it from me to tell you whether or not he survives ... I'd hate to ruin the ""suspense"".  Let's just say that it all fades out with what is supposed to be an ironically symbolic exchange between two characters that comes off as unbearably trite and corny.Two stars is being charitable.  The blu-ray is a 20th Century-Fox release of an MGM film, adequately presented, and the only extras are the theatrical trailer and 3 TV spots.

It certainly isn't gorey by today's standards.  This, perhaps, is what makes people so uncomfortable about this movie--their own reaction to the violence.  Hoffman conveys wonderfully both the fear and the satisfaction his character is experiencing.At one level, this film exists as a simple tale of revenge.

I can understand why, especially since a group of British ruffians are shown in a bad light.  Yes.  I found it violent.  And yet it is more than that.  It's a psychological study of the hero turning from mouse to man.Dustin Hoffman stars as a quiet mathematician who moves to England with his wife, Susan George, for peace and quiet and time to work on his studies.  A gang of young toughs harasses them with dire results.  Time after time Dustin Hoffman refuses to take a stand against them.  Susan George taunts her husband, picks fights with him and tries to compete with his love of mathematics.  Eventually, the violence against them escalates and Dustin is forced to defend his home.I found the beginning slow but this was the director, Sam Pickenpah's intention.  The tension mounts slowly and then, when it does erupt, it bursts forth with horror. The acting was excellent even though the situation seemed a bit overdone.  Mostly I enjoyed it for its historical significance because I know that this kind of film wouldn't be made today.  That's because the role for the wife is nothing less than that of a stereotypical female.  She doesn't have any meaningful work or interests of her own other than trying to get her husband's interest and flaunting her body in front of the workingmen.  She is whiney and weak and has big tears in her eyes most of the time.  Finally, at the end, she somewhat redeems herself, but she is definitely an unlikable character.

229936,ACNYNP9C0469S,6300251217,manicsounds,"[0, 1]","This is probably not his best known film. Yet again, Sam Peckinpah is not very known at all outside his audience or film majors. But you can&#65533;t deny his wit and style that influenced many filmmakers in the generations that followed with his distinct ways. &#65533;Straw Dogs&#65533;Ewas also released the same year as &#65533;A Clockwork Orange&#65533;E giving us 2 violent classics in one year. Many blamed &#65533;Straw Dogs&#65533;Efor glamorizing a violent lifestyle, and using violent images as a way to rebel and/or entertain audiences. From the rape scene to the violent end, images haunt you. Especially the way Peckinpah intercut shots of the rape scene further into the film, almost subliminally with a single frame.But Peckinpah did not use this movie to glamour violence, but only to show how much it can destroy one self, and hurt others in the process. It is more about growth, of how a man who could not stand up for himself in the past can transform into almost a monstrosity of power in his own self defense. At the same time distancing himself from what he used to be, and coping with what he has become. This is not glamorous. He shows how this can be very dangerous. But if you were in the same shoes as David Sumner (Dustin Hoffman), would you do the same? Or if you were a friend of David&#65533;s before the movie, would you still befriend the David after the closing credits?This is distinctly a Peckinpah film with a psychological twist. And only human. Many layers are involved and can definitely use multiple viewings. Image Entertainment released this movie a while back bare-boned and non-anamorphic. Criterion Collection got the rights and preserved this the way it is meant to be.The restoration is unbelievably good, and it probably has not sounded or looked this good since its premier in 1971. But all in all, it&#65533;s all about the supplements. An intriguing booklet with tons of essays and an interview with the ever-stubborn Peckinpah is also included. The second disc is filled with material, including recent interviews with Susan George and Daniel Melnick, and an on-location interview with Dustin Hoffman (the new &#65533;It Guy&#65533;Ein cinema) from 1971 BBC. But the BBC documentary &#65533;Man Of Iron&#65533;Estands out the most. An intriguing documentary about one of the most influential directors who ever lived, with many clips of friends and family tell stories of the director&#65533;s style and might, trying to explain his material to censors, critics, and audiences and his ultimately lonely end.Criterion has done extremely well on this one. This one is too good to leave on the shelf, and especially with the fact that this DVD will only be around until 2004 (supposedly). THIS IS THE WAY A CLASSIC UNDERAPPRECIATED MOVIE IS SUPPOSED TO BE TREATED. Thank you Criterion, you answered many fans of cinema, and Peckinpah.Best Shot/Sequence:You HAVE to watch the movie in its entirety to understand this.

It is a movie about the violence that is pent up in one's soul only to released in a controlled manner. Dustin Hoffman has made a career of playing the intellectual urban New Yorker. In STRAW DOGS he is the married more mature Benjamin Braddock of THE GRADUATE. He lives in America, happily married to a sexy Susan George. Despairing of living in a country that he came to see as increasingly violent, he and his wife move to her country in Wales, where she encounters a former boyfriend. While Dustin is out of town, in walks the boyfriend, and within minutes, what the audience thought might turn into a graphic rape scene instead morphed into a graphic condemnation of his wife's chastity. Their clothing hits the floor and the wife stands revealed as an adulteress. Clueless Dustin at first suspects nothing, then he gets involved both in protecting a retarted man, well played by the perennial villain, David Warner, from a lynch mob, and escaping from the a group of Welsh hooligans who seek now to murder both him and his wife. These local toughs are seen as being tough in body but weak in mind...STRAW DOGS shows the difference between a man who can control his violence and release it only as needed and one who allows his violence to control him.

I actually saw the 2011 remake just the other night and while there are many similarities, the significant difference is that in the original David and Amy Sumner are vastly more complex - and unlikeable.  David is an emotional void--condescending, insensitive, rude and extremely self-centered.  Amy is more vapid, flirtatious, and emotionally abused.  Peckinpah's noted assurance of filming violent cinema in an almost poetic fashion is evidenced in the climactic finish.  Dustin Hoffman is his usual competent self, going from the repressed nerdish mathematician to the vicious warrior he eventually becomes.  I was more impressed, however, with Susan George, an actress who never seemed to go anywhere with her career.  Her rape scene is very disturbing in its enigmnatic complexity---rape or some form of kinky sex?  It's the ambiguity that makes it so disturbing.  An uncredited David Warner is chillingly effective in a small but significant role as the village ""idiot"".STRAW DOGS is not an ""enjoyable"" film but one to be appreciated for its craftmanship.

229942,A2H9LUUCYE0KJC,6300251217,Mr Peter G George,"[12, 15]","The packaging for this DVD shows the futility of banning the film. The slogan `Banned in the UK' can be used the world over as a means of selling the film. It is assumed that the film will consequently be ultra-violent, but this is a misconception. This film is not banned because of its gruesome conclusion, but solely because of the rape scene. I recently saw an interview with the British censor who explained his reasoning. He argued that the scene is unacceptable because it advocates the `male myth' that a woman will enjoy rape. The film could have been distributed with some cuts, but the studio, quite rightly, turned down this option. The absurdity of the censor's position is that there are other films freely available which have rape scenes which show a woman apparently enjoying rape, including Doctor Zhivago and High Plains Drifter. Moreover, Susan George's character in Straw Dogs can hardly be said to have enjoyed the experience in the end. She is left distraught and broken. It is a great pity that this film is banned in Britain, for it is a film of great artistic worth. It is not as if this is some cheap little sordid film, rather it one of the key works of a great director. I found the film interesting because it develops its story in a gradual way allowing time for characters to develop. The final d&eacute;nouement has all the more power because of this build up. It is worth noting that there is some confusion regarding the setting of this film. It is supposed to be Cornwall, in the Southwest of England. This is clear from the accents of the British actors. This DVD has no extras, but at least it shows the film in its complete version. The picture quality is fine and only the sound is a little unclear at times.

229943,A1SHPX0VCXMRXT,6300251217,"Mr. S. A. Lukacs ""Simbob""","[5, 9]","Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs is set in deepest darkest Cornwall among a collection of yokels and idiots that would give the inbreds from Deliverence a run for their money in the half witted sexual deviant stakes. Leaving aside obvious grievances that the Cornwall Tourist Board will have with the film, what lies beneath the surface of this slick and stylish Western-by-the-sea ia a far more intriguing, puzzling and reasonably disturbing proposition. Taking residence in the quiet, backwoods (surely backwards?) English county with his English wife, Amy (Susan George), mathematician David Summer (Dustin Hoffman) is hoping the peaceful rural surroundings will help him finish a theory he is working on. Just one problem - this is Amy's birth place, and the couple are soon stirring the attentions of the locals, particularly Amy's ex-boyfriend. And the attentions are not exactly welcome.Peckinpah's odyssey of masculine enlightenment is troubling in a number of ways. There, is of course, the now infamous rape scene, itself considered too daring by UK censors for the best part of twenty years due to its ""she likes it really"" philosophy. This may grab all the headlines, but the real trouble here is with the issues this, and the later siege at the cottage, present to the audience.Straw Dogs is essentially a film about the empowering effect of affirmative action, of violence. In its exploration of primal urges and instinct it probably shares more in common with a film such as Fight Club than the 'Rape' films of its era, such as Clockwork Orange, with which it is constantly and unfairly bracketed. Peckinpah's film is a much darker and more intriguing piece than Kubrick's modern morality fable, but intrigue does not always guarantee satisfaction. He is grappling with a serious and sensitive idea here, and he has to be applauded for his bravery in doing so, although Peckinpah was never one to shy away from 'difficult' issues. But for all his intentions (good or otherwise) it is maybe this gung-ho, no holds barred balls in hand attitude that is the films flaw. The final scene, in which David, who has for the majority of the film been avoiding any kind of conversation, much to the annoyance of Amy, dispatches the various locals who are attempting to break into his house in a variety of gruesome ways, is probably the most troubling. As he drives away from the scene, David allows himself a self-satisfied smile. He has become empowered, more of a 'man'. This, allied to the rape scene's ""she likes a bit of rough"" sentiments seem to create a rather simplistic and quite ugly moral philosophy. Amy is raped by her ex, who to her is the symbol of the rugged primal male psyche which she has for too long been deprived of from David. Men should be men and anyway thats how women want them to be, regardless of whatever deeper implications others may place on the film, seems really to be its message.The blame for this can really only be pointed at one man, Sam Peckinpah. Peckinpah is one of America's greatest directors, but his mysoginistic tendencies hamper his handling of a complex matter. The film is fascinating, watchable, interesting and nigh on essential for followers of cinema, but it is hard to watch it without being confused by its intentions, and without taking away a slightly sour taste in the mouth.It would be difficult to call the film an honourable failure, so an interesting one would be more appropriate.

There is truly no other film like this. Sam Peckinpah is such a great director and he did a great job with this. It has all of the usual trademark elements of his films such as slow motion, violence and a haunting Jerry Fielding score.  This comes straight out of 71 along with Clockwork Orange and Get Carter which was quite a year for tough and bleak films. The script is great and the violence while controversial is very well shot.

229946,A1U4VN19O89I3U,6300251217,"Nick S ""Film, Book and Music Freak""","[4, 6]","As an unsettling and draining look into the horrors of fascist and territorial ideas breed out of masculinity, the 1971 film ""Straw Dogs"" is an emotionally peeling viewing that will bring your own viewpoints to the surface. The film garners the high proverb of being a messed-up western, character study, thriller, war film, action movie, social analysis, and an art house film rolled into one; while its philosophies show its perceived messages as an absolute: yet, one may see a gray area between those apparent viewpoints, ones speculated, and the rest will bring about the viewers own real life feelings into light about the context of the film. All these subtexts inside Straw Dogs are presented in a mature, non-exploitive way, piling on the dimension of its unique central characters, without giving a definite feeling of sympathy.The plot concerns the nighttime assault by a group of ruffians on a pastoral home in which a man that is suspected of killing a girl is staying.  The owners of the house, David and Amy-- Dustin Hoffman and Susan George,-- feel the man is entitled to a trial, and must find a way to fight back and survive the night.Some may see Straw Dogs as a feminist film, in the way that the stereotypical male hormonal and aggression concepts set forth in the initial two acts of the  film, are further acknowledged by the violent and bloody testosterone set pieces in the final ""showdown."" Yet, there is no female or male character to connect to in the typical cinematic way of them  being ""purely likeable."" The audience will rather connect to the characters of David and Amy more because they are the only marginal likeable characters in the film, and we can agree with many of their actions, even if its often in the form of self-serving, or if the rest of the film depicts them as unsympathetic cowards. This is because the humanistic side of the audience will not want any more violence be committed to any character in the film, because its not ""cool violence,"" rather it is brutal, and nihilistic.These medieval concepts are shown in David's  ascent into a ""man"" protecting his territory. This is poetic in the way of ultimate truth over the ""peace-and-love"" beliefs of the time; while Amy, despite some childish antics of young boys, is in many ways the man of the relationship, before going callow for most of the final siege scene. Yet, when the time comes to have her pick up a sword--so to speak-- she obliges. Yet, this absolute truth, also has a definite, antisocial reaction in the way that there is not one glimmer of decency seem to be left in all those who survive-- rather they go off into their own respective roles of ""man"" and ""woman"" without a sense of direction for the future.The often written about two dialogue lines show this, they are:Henry Niles-- ""I don't know my way home.""David-- "" That's ok. I don't either.""It is this dialogue exchange that shows the way that the rest of the cast was either one-noted stock characters, or neanderthalistic sexual and/or violent fix-seekers; and there is no sense of valediction for any of these ""animals."" Their violent actions, no matter how necessary they seem at the time, only make them more isolated from others. Peckinpah`s real life personality was driven by a lust for alcohol and a clenched fist ready to fight; this educated, but untamed persona seems to bleed through the film, as if it is a demon exertion exercise for Peckinpah, an acknowledgement of who he is, but as if saying this is how all people are when pitted with grave life-threatening obstacles, it thus becomes survival of the fittest, like in the animal kingdom. Yet, at the same time, when we make this choice to go back to our ancestry, it does not come without consequences-- in this case, total isolation from the rest of the civilized world, as if going back to the hunter and gathering civilizations.It is this philosophy of humans as an animal that makes ""Straw Dogs"" still so bloody good today. As this is certainly one of the best films of all time, and is a masterpiece of savagery that clearly shows that human horror is the most threatfull thing to our race of all.10 (Out of 10 in 0.5 increments)",5,A Man's World on Feminist Terms.,1174521600,"03 22, 2007",2007,4181,"['unsettling', 'draining', 'look', 'horrors', 'fascist', 'territorial', 'ideas', 'breed', 'masculinity', '1971', 'film', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'emotionally', 'peeling', 'viewing', 'will', 'bring', 'own', 'viewpoints', 'surface', 'film', 'high', 'proverb', 'being', 'messed-up', 'western', 'character', 'study', 'thriller', 'war', 'film', 'action', 'movie', 'social', 'analysis', 'art', 'house', 'film', 'rolled', 'one', 'philosophies', 'show', 'perceived', 'messages', 'absolute', 'yet', 'one', 'may', 'see', 'gray', 'area', 'apparent', 'viewpoints', 'ones', 'speculated', 'rest', 'will', 'bring', 'viewers', 'own', 'real', 'life', 'feelings', 'light', 'context', 'film', 'subtexts', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'are', 'presented', 'mature', 'non-exploitive', 'way', 'piling', 'dimension', 'unique', 'central', 'characters', 'giving', 'definite', 'feeling', 'sympathy.The', 'plot', 'nighttime', 'assault', 'group', 'ruffians', 'pastoral', 'home', 'man', 'suspected', 'killing', 'girl', 'staying', 'owners', 'house', 'David', 'Amy', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Susan', 'George', 'feel', 'man', 'entitled', 'trial', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'fight', 'back', 'survive', 'night.Some', 'may', 'see', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'feminist', 'film', 'way', 'stereotypical', 'male', 'hormonal', 'aggression', 'concepts', 'set', 'forth', 'initial', 'two', 'acts', 'film', 'are', 'further', 'acknowledged', 'violent', 'bloody', 'testosterone', 'set', 'pieces', 'final', 'showdown', 'Yet', 'female', 'male', 'character', 'connect', 'typical', 'cinematic', 'way', 'being', 'purely', 'likeable', 'audience', 'will', 'rather', 'connect', 'characters', 'David', 'Amy', 'more', 'are', 'only', 'marginal', 'likeable', 'characters', 'film', 'can', 'agree', 'many', 'actions', 'even', 'often', 'form', 'self-serving', 'rest', 'film', 'unsympathetic', 'cowards', 'humanistic', 'side', 'audience', 'will', 'not', 'want', 'more', 'violence', 'be', 'committed', 'character', 'film', 'not', 'cool', 'violence', 'rather', 'brutal', 'nihilistic.These', 'medieval', 'concepts', 'are', 'shown', 'David', 'ascent', 'man', 'protecting', 'territory', 'poetic', 'way', 'ultimate', 'truth', 'peace-and-love', 'beliefs', 'time', 'Amy', 'childish', 'antics', 'young', 'boys', 'many', 'ways', 'man', 'relationship', 'going', 'callow', 'most', 'final', 'siege', 'scene', 'when', 'time', 'have', 'pick', 'up', 'sword', 'so', 'speak', 'absolute', 'truth', 'also', 'definite', 'antisocial', 'reaction', 'way', 'not', 'one', 'glimmer', 'decency', 'seem', 'be', 'left', 'who', 'survive', 'rather', 'go', 'off', 'own', 'respective', 'roles', 'man', 'woman', 'sense', 'direction', 'future.The', 'often', 'written', 'about', 'two', 'dialogue', 'lines', 'show', 'are', 'Henry', 'Niles', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'way', 'home', 'David', 'ok', 'do', ""n't"", 'either', 'dialogue', 'exchange', 'way', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'one-noted', 'stock', 'characters', 'neanderthalistic', 'sexual', 'and/or', 'violent', 'fix-seekers', 'sense', 'valediction', 'animals', 'violent', 'actions', 'matter', 'how', 'necessary', 'seem', 'time', 'only', 'make', 'more', 'isolated', 'others', 'Peckinpah', 's', 'real', 'life', 'personality', 'was', 'driven', 'lust', 'alcohol', 'clenched', 'fist', 'ready', 'fight', 'educated', 'untamed', 'persona', 'bleed', 'film', 'demon', 'exertion', 'exercise', 'Peckinpah', 'acknowledgement', 'who', 'saying', 'how', 'all', 'people', 'are', 'when', 'pitted', 'grave', 'life-threatening', 'obstacles', 'thus', 'survival', 'fittest', 'animal', 'kingdom', 'same', 'time', 'when', 'make', 'choice', 'go', 'back', 'ancestry', 'not', 'come', 'consequences', 'case', 'total', 'isolation', 'rest', 'civilized', 'world', 'going', 'back', 'hunter', 'gathering', 'civilizations.It', 'philosophy', 'humans', 'animal', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'still', 'bloody', 'good', 'today', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'time', 'masterpiece', 'savagery', 'clearly', 'human', 'horror', 'most', 'threatfull', 'thing', 'race', 'all.10', '10', '0.5', 'increments']",Straw Dogs VHS
229947,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,6300251217,Only-A-Child,"[3, 6]","Caution-possible spoilers ahead: The old Hollywood production code required that justice be rewarded and evil punished, the last genre to hold onto this concept was the Western (and prime time television). Violence was always highly selective; you might see the good guy wounded once in a while, but it was almost always the ""deserving"" bad guys who got killed. This reflected the U.S. mainstream view of violence and of pre-Viet Nam foreign affairs. What made 'The Wild Bunch' revolutionary was that Peckinpah made violence universal. Everyone stood in the same shade of gray/neutral moral middle-ground and everyone; men, women, children, dogs, and chickens were shot up in the final scene, regardless of their guilt or innocence (not unlike the diverse group of victims at Kent State in 1970).Then along comes 'Straw Dogs' and Peckinpah makes another violent anti-violence film where the moral distinctions between victims (be they physical or psychological victims) is again ambiguous.The film opens with a processional of Amy and 'Wannabee Amy' (Sally Thomsett in a dead-on Lolita performance) turning all the male heads as they walk through the village. And this introduces us to the parallel stories that will be taking place during the film. Amy will spend much of her time amusing herself by provocatively arousing a group of young men in the village. Thomsett's character will spend her time flirting with David (the Dustin Hoffman character) and with the village idiot (David Warner doing Lon Chaney's Lennie from 'Mice and Men'). Just one year removed from playing an innocent child in 'The Railway Children' Thomsett is perfect as every father's nightmare of a post-pubescent boy-crazy daughter.Peckinpah's theme is about personal responsibility (and irresponsibility) and how actions have consequences. Amy and 'Wannabee Amy' will play with fire during the first part of the movie. Amy will tease the young men of the village, will playfully run them off the road with her car, and will fearlessly challenge them about killing her cat. She will even become a willing participant in what starts out as forced sex with her former boyfriend. But Amy will suffer the consequences when this is followed up by an actual rape. 'Wannabee Amy' will seduce the village idiot and suffer the consequences when he panics and accidentally kills her.At this point Amy wants no more consequences from her irresponsibility. But David stubbornly insists on protecting the village idiot until the authorities arrive. When the magistrate arrives and is killed by the five goons outside their house, David pragmatically concludes that the goons cannot let Amy and him live, even if they turn over the village idiot. Once cornered David must fight and reverts to primitive animalistic behavior.I think Peckinpah is telling us that we still have an innate instinctual capacity for violence and instinctual responses to violence, that women are still excited and attracted by these displays and may consciously or subconsciously incite them. Call it part of the courtship ritual, it probably has an evolutionary function.In addition to the parallel story lines that occasionally touch each other before finally coming together and essentially ending, Peckinpah structures the film so that a third storyline then takes over. After Amy's need for excitement has set the events in motion and they have escalated beyond her control, she withdraws and refuses to deal with anything anymore. Her active role is then taken up by the formerly passive David, who until this point has been dodging confrontation. First he is pushed to a point where he stubbornly refuses to back down any further, and finally he is cornered with has no place to back down even if inclined to do so.I was very impressed with the work of the Production Designer on this film. The countryside, village, and house have a very uniform visual style that fits the storyline of a foreigner dealing with an insular community.I really have no problems with this film. I found it one of those few films that are riveting from the very start. During my initial viewing I recall hating the scene where David and Amy are arguing while sitting on opposite sides of the fireplace. I was mentally protesting 180-degree rule violations and the disorienting cuts. But by the end I realized that this visually reinforced the unraveling of their relationship; it is a good example of why movie-making conventions can be broken if breaking them advances the story line.'Straw Dogs' takes place in a Peckinpah world where men must be willing to do life's dirty work and anything else if they wish to survive, and where actions have consequences. This is a world where love has limits and might even be impossible.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",5,Extremely Influential,1120176000,"07 1, 2005",2005,4798,"['Caution-possible', 'spoilers', 'ahead', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'code', 'required', 'justice', 'be',

Nobody ever seems to mention that the Dustin Hoffman character is a totally cold and insensitive jerk who verbally abuses his wife every chance he can get. When the thugs come to his house initially, it is to get a drunken man who had possibly done something to the daughter of the gang; Hoffman's character refuses to hand the man over-- mostly because out of sheer arrogance that sparks the big, and final confrontation. I watched with grim fascination how  he fought off five bad guys while at the same time I was thinking such a horrendous jerk really needed and deserved to get the stuffing beat out of him.All in all, I really like this movie; Susan George gives a great performance as the put upon wife who is abused by her husband and raped by the men in the village where they live and Peckinpah's direction gives us many plot twists that go right up to the ending.

It is directed by Sam Pekinpah and it would be an understatement to say that this director is never shy to show a little blood in his movies. When this movie was released in 1971it is was critically acclaimed but also had its fair share of censorship problems. The movie was banned in the UK for almost 30 years afterwards and countless other countries cut it to ribbons before it could be shown on the screen or television.Basically the story revolves around a quiet, shy, mathematician, David Summers played by Dustin Hoffman and his wife Amy played by Susan George, who move to the English countryside for some rest and relaxation in a house that belonged to her parents. They hire some men from the local village to help restore the house and some of these men have a past connection with Amy. They also display a talent for xenophobia and start to tease David and his wife. Back in the village Major John Scott a local policeman is having problems keeping some of the more rowdy villagers in their place. A simple man called Henry Niles, played by David Warner, is also taking an unhealthy interest in one of the village girls.Basically the film is one big buildup to a siege at Davids home where he harbors a man who may have murdered someone in the town. He wants to turn him over to the justice officials but some of the town just want a lynch mob instead. David tries to overcome his cowardlines by making a final stand in his own home. The climax which lasts some twenty to thirty minutes is violent, graphic, bloody and shocking.It is controversial because it contained a very realistic rape scene sequence for its time (1971), but this is not all that makes this film controversial. It also has scenes of child abuse, a few scenes with animal abuse (watch Hoffman smash an apple off the family cat), a blasphemous statement or two and an authority figure who gets the long end of a shotgun barrel. It is also very dogmatic showing a very brutal dumb countryside folk in stark contrast to David intelligent American. Even the local priest is treated as nothing more than a money grabber. All in all, this was enough for most censorship boards to be worried that the film may offend people and make no mistake about it - this is a very offensive film in very many ways.Pekinpah wants us to be offended. He wants David to be offended. He wants to see how much we and our main protagonist can take before we finally break. Straw Dogs is one big boiling pot of hate and sooner or later it is going to exploded.... and it does.Straw Dogs is a very original movie that makes a psychological impact. You have never seen anything like it before and you will probably never see anything like it again. Just do not buy into all the prejudice that is on display here.

229952,A1HWBDRNYLCK05,6300251217,Patrick Dunn,"[2, 4]","This film gets excellent treatment in this DVD, despite the quibbles one might have over over-acadamized touches in some of the essay/commentary material, but I suppose that only goes to prove the film's impact and staying power.  Lots of interesting extras, well worth the investment, especially for Sam fans.I have a mixed reaction to the voice-over commentary, much of which is interesting, some of which I find debatable.  I take exception to the idea that David is in fact the ""heavy"", though his passive-aggressive conduct is note-worthy.  Peckinpah may indeed have originated this notion, but he was known to be argumentative, and not always the most trustworthy interpreter of his own films (Major Dundee as Moby Dick in the desert?).I think he may have been trying to down-play the idea of David as home-defending hero, which he knew would be a reaction, and was mainly planting the idea that the character wasn't all that admirable. I mean, if David's the heavy, who's the protagonist?A quick glance at many of the non-academic reactions to the film's climactic sequence should give a clue as to whom the audience at least wants to root for. Maybe we're meant to be completely repulsed, and not pull for anyone in the final melee, but that's tough to do; I don't believe the case can be made that the local toughs are the good guys, anyway.David Sumner is definitely the film's protagonist, and rather like Alex in the other infamously violent film released the same year, A Clockwork Orange, he attracts audience sympathy despite his flaws. The director needs for the audience to identify with someone in his story, while setting them up to question what that identification means.Also, the voice-over guy is locked into a woman-good, man-bad mindset, at least in regard to the Amy and David couple.  According to the commentator, David is completely cold, uncaring, vicious, selfish, and other bad stuff, while Amy is his noble, all-virtuous victim.  Not only does this contradict the usual Peckinpah-as-misogynist stuff available in the ""Man of Iron"" documentary, but it goes against the director's running theme of violence and complicity.  He completely ignores Amy's role in pushing David into a more macho, violent stance - he only seems interested in finding ways to denigrate the David character, and you can hear his argument running out of steam toward the end.As for ""Man of Iron"" - I had seen it broadcast some years ago, and recall being somewhat disappointed, though I appreciated it more on seeing it again.  It is rather rambling, with some I think dubious interiew subjects - the screenwriter Alan Sharp for instance, who apparently only worked on one picture with Peckinpah, which he seemed ashamed of, and otherwise didn't seem to really know the man or think too much of his work.  The documentary tends to go off on tangents, like the obligatory woman-hating and brutal-behaviour accusations, which go mostly unsupported here.  On the other hand, Kristofferson, Coburn, R.G. Armstrong, L.Q. Jones and others offer lots of interesting incidents and insights, and make it overall a valuable, touching look at the maverick filmmaker.",5,A Deserving Film Gets a Great Package,1054857600,"06 6, 2003",2003,3162,"['film', 'excellent', 'treatment', 'DVD', 'quibbles', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'over', 'over-acadamized', 'touches', 'essay/commentary', 'material', 'suppose', 'only', 'prove', 'film', 'impact', 'staying', 'power', 'Lots', 'interesting', 'extras', 'well', 'investment', 'especially', 'Sam', 'fans.I', 'have', 'mixed', 'reaction', 'voice-over', 'commentary', 'much', 'interesting', 'find', 'debatable', 'take', 'exception', 'idea', 'David', 'fact', 'heavy', 'passive-aggressive', 'conduct', 'note-worthy', 'Peckinpah', 'may', 'indeed', 'have', 'originated', 'notion', 'was', 'known', 'be', 'argumentative', 'not', 'always', 'most', 'trustworthy', 'interpreter', 'own', 'films', 'Major', 'Dundee', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'desert', '.I', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'down-play', 'idea', 'David', 'home-defending', 'hero', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'reaction', 'was', 'mainly', 'planting', 'idea', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'admirable', 'mean', 'David', 'heavy', 'who', 'protagonist', 'quick', 'glance', 'many', 'non-academic', 'reactions', 'film', 'climactic', 'sequence', 'should', 'give', 'clue', 'whom', 'audience', 'least', 'root', 'Maybe', ""'re"", 'meant', 'be', 'completely', 'repulsed', 'not', 'pull', 'anyone', 'final', 'melee', 'tough', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'case', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'local', 'toughs', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'anyway.David', 'Sumner', 'definitely', 'film', 'protagonist', 'rather', 'like', 'Alex', 'other', 'infamously', 'violent', 'film', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'audience', 'sympathy', 'flaws', 'director', 'audience', 'identify', 'someone', 'story', 'setting', 'up', 'question', 'what', 'identification', 'means.Also', 'voice-over', 'guy', 'locked', 'woman-good', 'man-bad', 'mindset', 'least', 'regard', 'Amy', 'David', 'couple', 'According', 'commentator', 'David', 'completely', 'cold', 'uncaring', 'vicious', 'selfish', 'other', 'bad', 'stuff', 'Amy', 'noble', 'all-virtuous', 'victim', 'Not', 'only', 'contradict', 'usual', 'Peckinpah-as-misogynist', 'stuff', 'available', 'Man', 'Iron', 'documentary', 'director', 'running', 'theme', 'violence', 'complicity', 'completely', 'Amy', 'role', 'pushing', 'David', 'more', 'macho', 'violent', 'stance', 'only', 'interested', 'finding', 'ways', 'denigrate', 'David', 'character', 'can', 'hear', 'argument', 'running', 'steam', 'end.As', 'Man', 'Iron', 'had', 'seen', 'years', 'ago', 'recall', 'being', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'appreciated', 'more', 'seeing', 'again', 'rather', 'rambling', 'think', 'dubious', 'interiew', 'subjects', 'screenwriter', 'Alan', 'Sharp', 'instance', 'who', 'apparently', 'only', 'worked', 'one', 'picture', 'Peckinpah', 'seemed', 'ashamed', 'otherwise', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'really', 'know', 'man', 'think', 'too', 'much', 'work', 'documentary', 'tends', 'go', 'off', 'tangents', 'obligatory', 'woman-hating', 'brutal-behaviour', 'accusations', 'go', 'mostly', 'unsupported', 'here', 'other', 'hand', 'Kristofferson', 'Coburn', 'R.G', 'Armstrong', 'L.Q', 'Jones', 'others', 'offer', 'lots', 'interesting', 'incidents', 'insights', 'make', 'overall', 'valuable', 'touching', 'look', 'maverick', 'filmmaker']",Straw Dogs VHS

229957,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6300251217,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 6]","Straw Dogs (Sam Peckinpah, 1971)I sat down to re-watch Straw Dogs, my favorite Sam Peckinpah movie, this weekend, and realized that somehow I'd never managed to review it. I'm rectifying that now, partially because I never did review it, and partially because I realized something new about the film this time-- something that most people who write plot synopses of the movie don't seem to have ever caught. Since I'll be discussing that, and it plays on a critical point in the movie, this review will be laced with spoilers. If you haven't seen the movie (or read Gordon Williams' book The Siege at Trencher's Farm, upon which the movie is based), you might want to skip over the second half of this review until after you have.The plot, if you've never seen the film: An astrophysicist, David Sumner (Dustin Hoffman), and his wife Amy (Susan George, who, like seemingly every other actor born in Britain, recently did a stint on EastEnders) leave America and buy a house in Amy's old hometown. It needs work, so they hire some local lads to do it, headed up by Charlie Venner (Soldier of Orange's Del Henney), an ex-boyfriend of Amy's. David is a bit of a pushover, and the provincial attitude of the natives gets to work trying to find interesting ways to humiliate him. When he tries to stand up to them, things escalate, and the cycle keeps growing until things have no choice but to end badly.BEGIN SPOILERS.Here's the interesting bit (and the big spoiler): most of the plot summaries I've read of the film (the current detailed synopsis on IMDB is an exception, going so far as to point out the exact same thing I'm about to) point to Amy's rape as the crux of the matter. (As a side note, this scene, which almost landed the movie an X rating in 1971, would likely garner it a mild PG-13 today.) This is in no way the case. I somehow managed to not notice, in all the times I've seen this movie in the past, that Amy never tells David she's been raped. It is a crux for the viewer of the film, but it in no way affects any character in the film save Amy and the workers. (And it affects Amy far less, when the crux of the movie does come, than it seems it should; she's still just as willing to side with the natives. The provincial attitude runs deep, it seems.) When the crux of the movie does come, it is, perhaps, the most important moral lesson the movie has to make, and it is one that has been buried over the years: that Henry (played remarkably by a young David Warner) is always a passive element in the events that surround him. Teenaged Janice (Man About the House's Sally Thomsett, whose film career would end in retirement soon after, as she switched over to theatre) is never less than fully, consciously aware of what she's doing when she seduces Henry, which makes the village's reaction to the situation all the more absurd (but, in today's idiotic culture of ""teenagers aren't old enough to know what they're doing,"" distressingly understandable), even more so because there are eyewitnesses to Janice's approaching Henry. It is truly shocking, and depressing, that this film holds up as well as it does today; were the same situation to happen today, the public would likely have the same ""off with their heads!"" reaction, and they'd be just as wrong. In fact, there was a situation in America a few years back that is almost an exact mirror of the Henry-Janice scenario in Straw Dogs, and it did, in fact, end with the public calling for blood. You have to love people who cling to outmoded and morally unjustifiable social mores, don't you?Given these two facets of the film, the way they combine in the climax of the movie leads to a bit of confusion, at least on my part. There is a scene where David realizes that Charlie has slept with Amy; however, it's set up in the opening scene that he is apprised of the fact that they're exes, and there's nothing in the scene to lead David to the belief that they slept together recently. I grant you, jealousy may run as deep as provincialism in Goodman and Peckinpah's script, but I get the feeling there's a scene, or even a snippet of a scene, missing somewhere. I also spent a great deal of time wondering (though this is nothing new) why it is that David cares at all about Amy after the events that open the final scene. She has shown beyond any doubt that her provincialism has won out over her marriage, a balance that's been tipping the entire film. She has a complete lack of understanding of the tenets that David has embraced and that cause his transformation (one which, when it's completed, will mean he no longer needs her). While she eventually comes to accept the shifting of the balance of power in the relationship, does it seem realistic to you that either of these people would still see a relationship between them at all? Now, obviously, this question goes unanswered at the end of things, as all we see of the aftermath of the siege is David leaving to drive Henry home, so it's entirely possible that David and Amy do part ways a few frames after the movie ends. We'll never know. But the implication is that they'll stay together, and that the previously assertive Amy is willing to accept that all the sudden David has taken charge. I'm just not buying it.END SPOILERSNone of that makes Straw Dogs any less my favorite Sam Peckinpah film. The pacing and the tension are pitch-perfect throughout, problems that Peckinpah sometimes struggled with in earlier films, and the casting is phenomenal; I can't imagine anyone other than Dustin Hoffman as David Sumner, and that's a rare thing for me. Peckinpah and excellent action cinematographer Jean Coquillon (who would go on to work with Peckinpah on two more films) fill the screen with unforgettable shot after unforgettable shot, making the film as much a visual feast as it is an obscene morality play. The script is fantastic, even when I end up asking myself questions about it for days afterwards (in fact, isn't that one of the things that makes for a great script?). For some, it will not be an easy film to watch, but Peckinpah has some very interesting things to say, and they should be heard. **** ",5,"Sheer, unadulterated genius.",1190332800,"09 21,

229958,A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ,6300251217,Robert Blake,"[1, 4]","Sam Peckinpah's &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; is a film that should be seen because of it's incredible realism. It's not as good as his other masterpiece, &quot;Bring Me The Head Of Alfredo Garcia,&quot; but it's  still alright. The screenplay and story are sort of weak, because they're  not complex enough. &quot;Straw Dogs,&quot; however, does succeed because  it shows violence and primal viciousness with a realism that few films have  captured. Like the best films of Oliver Stone and Luis Bunuel, Peckinpah  shows violence with a realism that hits hard and is hard to forget. This is  a study of violence and what can lead men to violence, or the primal  instinct to protect one's home. The script could have used one more  re-write or more thinking. Some strong events take place that never have  any important later in the story. Particulalrly one intense scene where the  hero's wife is raped in their home while he's away by one of the hoods, we  might think this is crucial, but it never has any real importance in the  rest of the story. I think Peckinpah was more interested in the surrealism  than the story, and in that area he works. This in a sense, is a bad movie,  but the violence is so real and effective that it elevates it into an  effective and disturbing film. It should be seen for the surrealism above  anything else.",3,Good Because It Vibrates With Realism,950400000,"02 13, 2000",2000,1338,"['Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'quot', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'quot', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'incredible', 'realism', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'masterpiece', 'quot', 'Bring', 'Me', 'Head', 'Alfredo', 'Garcia', 'quot', 'still', 'alright', 'screenplay', 'story', 'are', 'sort', 'weak', ""'re"", 'not', 'complex', 'enough', 'quot', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'quot', 'however', 'succeed', 'violence', 'primal', 'viciousness', 'realism', 'few', 'films', 'have', 'captured', 'best', 'films', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Luis', 'Bunuel', 'Peckinpah', 'violence', 'realism', 'hard', 'hard', 'forget', 'study', 'violence', 'what', 'can', 'lead', 'men', 'violence', 'primal', 'instinct', 'protect', 'one', 'home', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'one', 'more', 're-write', 'more', 'thinking', 'strong', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'never', 'have', 'important', 'later', 'story', 'Particulalrly', 'one', 'intense', 'scene', 'where', 'hero', 'wife', 'raped', 'home', 'away', 'one', 'hoods', 'might', 'think', 'crucial', 'never', 'real', 'importance', 'rest', 'story', 'think', 'Peckinpah', 'was', 'more', 'interested', 'surrealism', 'story', 'area', 'sense', 'bad', 'movie', 'violence', 'so', 'real', 'effective', 'effective', 'disturbing', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'surrealism', 'anything', 'else']",Straw Dogs VHS

The cuts made it even more provocative than Peckinpah intended.  Consequently, Straw Dogs was labeled by the media as an obscene, misogynistic piece of filmmaking. Regarding the uncut American version, even the esteemed Pauline Kael said it's ""the first American film that is a fascist work of art.""""Straw Dogs"" stands as one of Peckinpah's best, and a reminder of the ongoing struggle between an artist's freedom  and suppression by the powers that be.  But more than that, it's a brilliant and harrowing exploration of man's primitive animal nature and its implied, inherent violence.In 1971, this brilliant film galvanized critics and audiences alike.  The new unrated hi-def version allows for moments of even more explicit sex and violence that actually enhance the rhythm and intensity of this disturbing meditation on the will to survive.The Blu-ray looks very nice. Missing are the interesting DVD extras that included an 80 minute look at Peckinpah's films and a new interview with Susan George, who talks about her daring, controversial performance of a woman who -- for a few brief moments -- seemed to enjoy being raped.What does the phrase ""Straw Dogs"" mean?

In this movie, filmed in the rustic windblown countryside of Cornwall, Peckinpah makes marriage look as ugly and violent as the Wild West ever could.""Straw Dogs"" stars Dustin Hoffman, fresh off ""The Graduate"" as David Sumner, a young American mathematician who flees the raging cauldron of America during the Vietnam War to sit in his basement in Cornwall, England and ponder lofty math theorems.  His gorgeous, nubile British wife Amy (Susan George) struts her sexually-liberated-and-frustrated stuff through the tiny Cornwall town, taunting the locals and tempting fate.  She can't but help catch the eye of her former beau, Charlie (Del Henney) and his gang of labourers.David and Amy really have an ugly marriage.  They are in love with each other, but it's clear they are far from soulmates.  David spends hours ignoring Amy in his basement study working on math, and Amy responds not with understanding but with petulance.  He does not respect her, and she does not respect him, and for such an attractive couple (Amy is a particular knock-out and insists on wearing the shortest of skirts and no bra, to everyone's notice) it appears that they have a rather hum-drum sex life.  To all of which they respond with little games of one-upsmanship and other minor relationship turf wars.  David is one unlikeable guy, and Hoffman manages to play against type superbly here.***Major Spoiler Alert!!!***  I usually don't include spoilers in reviews, but this is essential to understanding ""Straw Dogs"" and has also been the subject of much discussion over the years.  The movie takes a dark turn when the handful of labourers David has hired to work on his old farmhouse set up David and Amy for the infamous rape.  What makes this scene so controversial is the fact that Amy, after some initial-but-ineffectual fighting, actually seems to enjoy it when the first rapist takes her.  She is horrified when another labourer joins in, completely against her will.  This scene is Peckinpah's well-documented effort to make the audience feel guilty, 'cause we've been ogling Amy just like the rapists have.  And it succeeds - ""Straw Dogs"" is a movie that generally makes you feel pretty darn bad inside.  But it's undeniably effective.The rape scene is essential to the theme of the movie, but not its action.  Amy does not mention the rape to David.  David, however, runs up against the labourers after firing them.  He naively makes matters worse when David picks the wrong side of a local village war.  One Henry Niles (David Warner) is a simpleton but has a history of hurting young girls.  When Henry gets spotted leaving a church social with the daughter of one of the local toughs, a ""posse"" goes out for him.  David accidentally hits Henry with his car and brings Henry to his house to wait for the doctor to arrive.  The toughs learn of this and demand David release Niles into their ""custody,"" a sure death sentence.  David refuses out of principle.This leads to a long scene where the toughs get drunk and try to bash their way in to get David, Amy, and Niles.  It's one heck of a violent scene, for David taps into his hidden violence and is surprised to find out both how much he is capable of and also how much he enjoys it.  Peckinpah handles these violent scenes with realism - there are no Bruce Willis quips or ultra-slick ""kill shots.""  Just long, drawn-out brawling.  Nobody does that better than Peckinpah.At the end of the day, there is a high body count in ""Straw Dogs"" and no clear hero.  There is not a sympathetic major character anywhere in the movie, and that's just how Peckinpah wanted it.  As a result, be warned before diving into ""Straw Dogs.""

She only apears pleasurable with the first man because she's known him all her life! He isn't a complete stranger. The second man is. And so it would appear that being forced to have sex by someone you know is not as bad as been raped by someone you don't...understand? Ignorant 1 star reviewers? It's not because she fancies on man more then another as one reviewer stated (he was probably 13). You have to get over the fact that sex in films isn't awlays bad, and so critizing it blatently because of a naked breast is being shown is nonsense!I felt the movie didn't portray any sort of humour in any way.

They openly mock their employer, testing the professor's masculinity through varying degrees of humiliation while being spurred on by the flirtations of a wife whose sexual longing for them outweighs her fidelity.  Hoffman and George give excellent performances, but it is director Peckinpah who is the real star of this gritty film.  Refusing to pull punches, he vivisects the complex psychology of male aggression that is so often dismissed as simple and meaningless in society.  While the film is violent--including a controversial and graphic rape scene that questions the nature of responsibility--it is the brooding air of tension permeating the film that is the most disturbing.  Pay attention to little touches that drive the story, such as George calling not for her husband to rescue her in the film's bloody climax but for one of the rapists.  David Mamet would explore similar territory in his own ode to Hemingway, ""The Edge,"" but with less memorable results.",5,Powerful and Gut-Wrenching,1025222400,"06 28, 2002",2002,1445,"['Director', 'Bloody', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'cue', 'Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'visceral', 'perhaps', 'most', 'frank', 'depiction', 'male', 'hostility', 'ever', 'put', 'film', 'concept', 'simple', 'pacifist', 'professor', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'restless', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'Susan', 'George', 'bleak', 'farming', 'village', 'where', 'grew', 'up', 'marriage', 'as', 'incomplete', 'house', 'share', 'mismatched', 'pair', 'live', 'isolated', 'world', 'save', 'four', 'Alpha-males', 'hired', 'handymen', 'openly', 'mock', 'employer', 'testing', 'professor', 'masculinity', 'varying', 'degrees', 'humiliation', 'being', 'spurred', 'flirtations', 'wife', 'sexual', 'longing', 'fidelity', 'Hoffman', 'George', 'give', 'excellent', 'performances', 'director', 'Peckinpah', 'who', 'real', 'star', 'gritty', 'film', 'Refusing', 'pull', 'punches', 'complex', 'psychology', 'male', 'aggression', 'so', 'often', 'dismissed', 'simple', 'meaningless', 'society', 'film', 'violent', 'including', 'controversial', 'graphic', 'rape', 'scene', 'questions', 'nature', 'responsibility', 'brooding', 'air', 'tension', 'permeating', 'film', 'most', 'disturbing', 'Pay', 'attention', 'little', 'touches', 'drive', 'story', 'such', 'George', 'calling', 'not', 'husband', 'rescue', 'film', 'bloody', 'climax', 'one', 'rapists', 'David', 'Mamet', 'would', 'explore', 'similar', 'territory', 'own', 'ode', 'Hemingway', 'Edge', 'less', 'memorable', 'results']",Straw Dogs VHS

229973,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,6300251217,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[2, 2]","Director:  Sam PeckinpahCast:  Dustin Hoffman, Susan George, Peter Vaughn, T.P. McKenna, Del Henney, Jim Norton, Donald Webster, David Warner, Sally Thomsett.Running Time:  118 minutesRated R for violence, a disturbing rape scene, nudity, and some language.Reveled Director Sam Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969) was one of the most controversial films ever made for its time and is still be considered violent today. Plot progression was dealt with quickly but the violence was carefully elongated to create full pitched battles with shocking bloodletting. Most of the violence was filmed in slow motion, even when civilians were caught up in it. Death was no longer reserved for the ""bad-guys"" dressed in black. Every character was portrayed in different shades of gray. Also, Peckinpah used great dialogue and characterization so that combined with the performances of excellent actors (William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Warren Oates, Ben Johnson, Edmond O'Brien, Robert Ryan) he managed to pull together not a mindless gore-fest, but a picture that spoke of loyalty between friends and honor in death. Two years later Peckinpah directed ""Straw Dogs"". Although it, too, can be considered violent and it was definitely controversial (banned in the UK), ""Straw Dogs"" is a slight disappointment. It's set in a small town in rural England, which becomes the new home of American David Sumner (Dustin Hoffman) and his British wife Amy (Susan George). Together they are trying to escape the violence of American society and decide to settle down in Amy's peaceful hometown where David can find the time he needs to write his book on ""stellar interiors and their radiation characteristics"". The details on what he does are very vague. All that Peckinpah wants us to know is that David is one of society's intellectual elite. Of course, to follow the clich&eacute; when it comes to nerds in thrillers, David is portrayed as a coward without a spine. The locals soon begin to dislike David since his mannerisms seem alien to them. The situation deteriorates faster because one of the locals, Charlie Venner (Del Henney) was once Amy's boyfriend and is obviously jealous of David.The Sumner's move into Amy's father's old house and hire several men to repair the roof on their garage. Slowly the men (Charlie among them) begin to harass the two and invade their privacy. It gets worse as their actions become more sadistic and abusive. The tensions finally break one night when David is trying to protect the village idiot from an angry mob. Janice, the daughter of an uncontrollable drunk (also related to Charlie), was seen walking home one night with the idiot (who has a shady past when it comes to the safety of young girls) but then disappears. David, while driving home from a community event, accidentally hits the idiot and finds that it's his responsibility to take care of him at home. The drunk gathers together a mob and tries to manhandle the idiot into telling him where Janice is. David sums up his courage and decides to be a man, taking on a ""my house is my castle"" mentality. A bloody siege ensues.  Similar to ""The Wild Bunch"", ""Straw Dogs"" has many of Peckinpah's trademarks. It opens to a scene of children torturing a dog (""The Wild Bunch"" opened to the same thing except the dog was a scorpion). Both films end in bloody climaxes. The script for ""Straw Dogs"" has well-developed characters (right up to the last twenty minutes) and there is an excellently created atmosphere that helps deliver a sense of uneasiness with each line delivered by the outstanding cast. The differences between Amy and David, along with the harassment of the locals, all creates an almost unbearable tension. Amy is a lighthearted and beautiful young woman who acts so immature it's childish, and David is a selfish, solitary workaholic afraid of taking risks. The surrounding characters are all stupid, rude farmers with the exception of the local magistrate. All is perfectly set for the climax. Actually, the setup is so simple it's a little predictable. From there the movie goes further downhill. Peckinpah showed his talent for directing violent climaxes in ""The Wild Bunch"", but in ""Straw Dogs"" the violence is so long it's silly. The mob circles the Sumner home trying to break in. The doors are thick oak reinforced with steal, so it would seem sensible to go through the windows. No, that would shorten the action so they mill about for a while destroying the property. All is plausible since they're drunk, but a minute before they were sober and on a mission to save a young girl. Plausibility comes into question. It's all for violence's sake, which in the process cheapens the movie.Dustin Hoffman was never an actor to fear controversy, and ""Straw Dogs"" catches him right at the peak of his best years as an actor, after ""The Graduate"", ""Midnight Cowboy"" and ""Little Big Man"", and before ""Lenny"" and ""All The President's Men"". His performance is as amazing as in any of these, and again Hoffman proves his rare range, as well as his sensitivity; his performance carries the film to true excellence, and perhaps that's the other reason that the film was a bit more difficult to take than ""A Clockwork Orange"" - to take nothing away from the wonderful Malcolm McDowell, what Kubrick's film simply didn't have was a protagonist for the viewer to identify with, and therefore, like I stated before, it was easier to take as an analogy, and Alex functioned more as a symbolic and iconic character than as a real human being. David Sumner, on the other hand, is a remarkably realistic and convincing character, and one that is very easy to relate to, which makes the change that comes over him towards the end of the film all the more shocking. Again, it is that building up of tension that makes this film such a powerful experience. Besides these flaws ""Straw Dogs"" is an enjoyable motion picture with a different message than that of ""The Wild Bunch's"". In the latter, criminals past their prime go down with guns blazing to save their friend, proving their honor amongst thieves. It portrayed the ""bad guys"" as honorable but the ""good guys"" as greedy railroad barons. It showed that no man can be classified as either ""black"" or ""white"". We're all gray and everyone has sinned, it just matters whose shoes you're in whose eyes you see things through. ""Straw Dogs"", however, is about one man's personal transformation in order to protect his abused dignity. As the tag-line says, ""The knock at the door meant the birth of one man and the death of seven others."" ""Straw Dogs"" is still an enjoyable and thought provoking film.",4,Straw Dogs  (1971),1150848000,"06 21, 2006",2006,6631,"['Director', 'Sam', 'PeckinpahCast', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Susan', 'George',

229974,A1XAFVYHR65UF5,6300251217,this-shere guy,"[5, 6]","I think this is one of the most misunderstood movies I've ever run across.  Even the DVD box description on the version I have states that it is the tale of ""one man's journey from cowardice to courage"".  And after reading customer reviews that would go on for reams if they were written on paper, it seems that many of the people who have watched this movie understand it little better.I never viewed Hoffman's character as a coward or a weakling.  Certainly he was a bookish man of academia, unused to the coarse company of country laborers, but I never viewed him as frightened or even really intimidated by any of the gang in the film.  He never had any problem talking to the work crew as subordinates and hired men, especially when finally firing them.  His character was simply that of a very civilized man who did not anger easily or resort to violence for petty or trifling reasons.  He was a serious academic from NYC in Britain on a fellowship grant to study mathematics.  He wanted little else but to be left alone with his work.  His alternately comely and shrewish wife invited most of the trouble that came their way.I don't believe that he was AFRAID of violence, but that Hoffman's David was a man who did not believe that violence solved things.  It was the flauting of the rule of law in the lynch mob outside his door and their serious lethality that spurred him into action.  It was not the barrage of insults or petty tricks or harrassments.  It was the fact that the simpleton he was harboring in his home would be immediately KILLED if turned over to the boys outside, and moreover the fact that he, his wife, AND the simpleton would be killed should the boys come inside.  Back against the wall, David was not indecisive nor afraid of confrontation or action.The director, Sam Peckinpah, believed strongly in the element of violence in the natural world.  That it is neither necessarily good nor evil....only present and real and hanging over all of us as human beings even in ""civilized"" times.  He made violence and the exploration of it main themes in most of his movies, though probably none more obvious and direct as in Straw Dogs.I believe that his main theme for this movie is that the world is a violent place, and that being prepared to meet violence violently is a necessary rite of passage, for any person male or female.",5,Nary a coward in sight,1168646400,"01 13, 2007",2007,2358,"['think', 'one', 'most', 'misunderstood', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'run', 'Even', 'DVD', 'box', 'description', 'version', 'have', 'states', 'tale', 'one', 'man', 'journey', 'cowardice', 'courage', 'reading', 'customer', 'reviews', 'would', 'go', 'reams', 'were', 'written', 'paper', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', 'understand', 'little', 'better.I', 'never', 'viewed', 'Hoffman', 'character', 'coward', 'weakling', 'Certainly', 'was', 'bookish', 'man', 'academia', 'unused', 'coarse', 'company', 'country', 'laborers', 'never', 'viewed', 'frightened', 'even', 'really', 'intimidated', 'gang', 'film', 'never', 'had', 'problem', 'talking', 'work', 'crew', 'subordinates', 'hired', 'men', 'especially', 'when', 'finally', 'firing', 'character', 'was', 'simply', 'very', 'civilized', 'man', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'anger', 'easily', 'resort', 'violence', 'petty', 'trifling', 'reasons', 'was', 'serious', 'academic', 'NYC', 'Britain', 'fellowship', 'grant', 'study', 'mathematics', 'wanted', 'little', 'else', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'work', 'alternately', 'comely', 'shrewish', 'wife', 'invited', 'most', 'trouble', 'came', 'way.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'AFRAID', 'violence', 'Hoffman', 'David', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'believe', 'violence', 'solved', 'things', 'was', 'flauting', 'rule', 'law', 'lynch', 'mob', 'door', 'serious', 'lethality', 'spurred', 'action', 'was', 'not', 'barrage', 'insults', 'petty', 'tricks', 'harrassments', 'was', 'fact', 'simpleton', 'was', 'harboring', 'home', 'would', 'be', 'immediately', 'KILLED', 'turned', 'boys', 'moreover', 'fact', 'wife', 'simpleton', 'would', 'be', 'killed', 'should', 'boys', 'come', 'inside', 'Back', 'wall', 'David', 'was', 'not', 'indecisive', 'afraid', 'confrontation', 'action.The', 'director', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'believed', 'strongly', 'element', 'violence', 'natural', 'world', 'necessarily', 'good', 'evil', '.only', 'present', 'real', 'hanging', 'human', 'beings', 'even', 'civilized', 'times', 'made', 'violence', 'exploration', 'main', 'themes', 'most', 'movies', 'probably', 'none', 'more', 'obvious', 'direct', 'Straw', 'Dogs.I', 'believe', 'main', 'theme', 'movie', 'world', 'violent', 'place', 'being', 'prepared', 'meet', 'violence', 'violently', 'necessary', 'rite', 'passage', 'person', 'male', 'female']",Straw Dogs VHS

At the time, I was among many who thought of Peckinpah as a major player in American film, and I am one of those who regard &#34;The Wild Bunch&#34; as one of the best westerns of all time.  I thought seeing &#34;Straw Dogs&#34; again via this unrated version DVD would improve my opinion of the film, but time has not been kind.  This is just one of those stories with no one to root for.  David (Dustin Hoffman) is a young mathematician who has recently moved to his wife's hometown in rural England to finish a book.  Amy (Susan George), the wife, has proudly returned home with her academic husband, which she believes significantly improves her social standing among those with whom she grew up.  Evidently, Amy ran with a pretty rough bunch, and there is much about them to which she can still relate.  &#34;You can take the girl out of the country, but you can't take the country out of the girl.&#34;  Clearly, David didn't marry Amy for her intellect, but they do connect physically,  On the other hand, Amy's sexuality radiates to all males within a mile of her.  She may have kept it in check back in the States while David courted her, but now, back home, she is careless about it.  Furthermore, David may have been the coolest professor on campus back in the USA, but here, compared to her former boyfriend and his mates, she comes to see him as a cowardly wimp.  And, he is.  They probably have no business being married to each other, and the story arc of this film tests the marriage in the extreme.  But I still feel, even after my recent viewing, neither Amy nor David is a better person for all they have endured, and there is nothing implied in the script or in any shot the director composes to indicate these characters' feelings for each other have changed.  Regarding the performances, both Hoffman and George are nearly perfect.  If that is what drives you to watch this film, you won't be disappointed.",1,Still disappointing.,1404604800,"07 6, 2014",2014,1993,"['Saw', '34', 'Straw', 'Dogs', '34', 'theater', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'time', 'was', 'many', 'who', 'thought', 'Peckinpah', 'major', 'player', 'American', 'film', 'am', 'one', 'who', 'regard', '34', 'Wild', 'Bunch', '34', 'one', 'best', 'westerns', 'time', 'thought', 'seeing', '34', 'Straw', 'Dogs', '34', 'again', 'unrated', 'version', 'DVD', 'would', 'improve', 'opinion', 'film', 'time', 'not', 'been', 'kind', 'just', 'one', 'stories', 'one', 'root', 'David', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'young', 'mathematician', 'who', 'recently', 'moved', 'wife', 'hometown', 'rural', 'England', 'finish', 'book', 'Amy', 'Susan', 'George', 'wife', 'proudly', 'returned', 'home', 'academic', 'husband', 'significantly', 'social', 'standing', 'whom', 'grew', 'up', 'Evidently', 'Amy', 'ran', 'pretty', 'rough', 'bunch', 'much', 'can', 'still', 'relate', '34', 'can', 'take', 'girl', 'country', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'country', 'girl.', '34', 'Clearly', 'David', 'did', ""n't"", 'marry', 'Amy', 'intellect', 'do', 'connect', 'physically', 'other', 'hand', 'Amy', 'sexuality', 'males', 'mile', 'may', 'have', 'kept', 'check', 'back', 'States', 'David', 'courted', 'now', 'back', 'home', 'careless', 'Furthermore', 'David', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'coolest', 'professor', 'campus', 'back', 'USA', 'here', 'compared', 'former', 'boyfriend', 'mates', 'see', 'cowardly', 'wimp', 'probably', 'have', 'business', 'being', 'married', 'other', 'story', 'arc', 'film', 'marriage', 'extreme', 'still', 'feel', 'even', 'recent', 'viewing', 'Amy', 'David', 'better', 'person', 'have', 'endured', 'nothing', 'implied', 'script', 'shot', 'director', 'indicate', 'characters', 'feelings', 'other', 'have', 'changed', 'Regarding', 'performances', 'Hoffman', 'George', 'are', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'what', 'watch', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",Straw Dogs VHS

Dustin Hoffman is a mild-mannered (to put it mildly) mathematician who is incongruously married to a former town-pump.  Having made the mistake of moving to the Cornish village she once called home, he is summarily tested in his manhood by various village &quot;types,&quot; most of whom the British critics found outrageous and/or stereotypical.  Hoffman comes through.  At the loss of many a life and limb.  Typical Peckinpah.  Powerful, nonetheless.  And Jerry Fielding wrote a brilliant, Stravinsky-esque musical score.
