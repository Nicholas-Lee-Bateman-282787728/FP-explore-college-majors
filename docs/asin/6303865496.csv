The low expectations I had for it probably help the most. Compared to the second part, Best of the Best 3: No Turning Back is a lot better film because the story is more compelling to watch. The last twenty minute ending, a reminiscent of Cobra and Tango and Cash, is weak, but it doesn't take away the positive attributes of the overall film. Although Eric Roberts and Simon Rhee are missed, Phillip Rhee does a great job of holding the film together from start to finish. Every time I see a scene of doing him the martial arts, all I can think is that this is the guy who defeated a world champion in martial arts, and this guy would kick everybody's butt in the town. That's what makes it too hard to believe that Donnie Hanson would be able to hold his ground with him. And I don't think so. At the same time, the ending moment is highly doubtful. All those guns sported by the criminals are enough to undo Tommy Lee regardless of the outcome of the fight with Donnie. All in all, Best of the Best 3: No Turning Back is a solid picture.",4,Better than the 2nd Part.,1367020800,"04 27, 2013",2013,1171,"['Viewed', '4/13Rate', '74/13', 'Direct-to-video', 'not', 'Best', 'Best', '3', 'Turning', 'Back', 'out', 'be', 'entertaining', 'action', 'flick', 'low', 'expectations', 'had', 'probably', 'help', 'most', 'Compared', 'second', 'part', 'Best', 'Best', '3', 'Turning', 'Back', 'lot', 'better', 'film', 'story', 'more', 'compelling', 'watch', 'last', 'twenty', 'minute', 'ending', 'reminiscent', 'Cobra', 'Tango', 'Cash', 'weak', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'positive', 'attributes', 'overall', 'film', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'Simon', 'Rhee', 'are', 'missed', 'Phillip', 'Rhee', 'great', 'job', 'holding', 'film', 'together', 'start', 'finish', 'time', 'see', 'scene', 'doing', 'martial', 'arts', 'can', 'think', 'guy', 'who', 'defeated', 'world', 'champion', 'martial', 'arts', 'guy', 'would', 'kick', 'everybody', 'butt', 'town', 'what', 'too', 'hard', 'believe', 'Donnie', 'Hanson', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'hold', 'ground', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'same', 'time', 'ending', 'moment', 'highly', 'doubtful', 'guns', 'sported', 'criminals', 'are', 'enough', 'undo', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'regardless', 'outcome', 'fight', 'Donnie', 'Best', 'Best', '3', 'Turning', 'Back', 'solid', 'picture']",Best of the Best 3 VHS

With that being said, this movie is a keeper.The Aryan Brotherhood cloaks a small town that Tommy(Rhee) sister's family stays in fear. There are unwritten rules about how lowly non-pure whites must conduct themselves and that whites must not help these ""inferiors"" or  foul up The Brotherhood's business or affairs. There is their ring leader(Agent Russ in Rush Hour), who causes all kinds of trouble spreading the ""message"" wherever he treads. His goons also pollute the town on missions, either by violence or rhetoric. This quasileader for all intents and purposes is the leader, but when confronted and with the help of his most trusted goon makes it official. Tommy's bro-in-law is the local sheriff who'd rather do things by the book, even though thugs and goons  never do.  That's  the problem with law enforcement in the town. Nothing ever gets done and they are allowed to run unchecked. Two events bring about the ire of Tommy and his bro-in-law enough to take action: Luther's preacher father(black and well respected member of town life) is murdered and Tommy's sister is attacked. When this happens, they work together to infiltrate the organization and destroy it. Tommy handles the martial arts and ninja espionage and his bro-in-law covers him with a shotgun. A warrior battle eventually ensues between Tommy and the head of the Brotherhood both to end its reign over the town and for the hearts of the Brotherhood.There is also a white single family, Gina Gershon(Rhee's girlfriend), and an Aryan minister that add subplots  into the story. Other than the corny musical tunes at times and low budget setup(makes it feel like a time longer ago than the movie suggests: movie is supposed to be early 90s, but feels like the 60s or early 70s), you will like this movie if you like both martial arts films and racial correction films(as American History X was). You may also like it if you like either or the other or if you were looking for a PG-13 version of American History X.  Negative: There is a scene where he did this video game Lui  Kang kick to get to the guy on the motorcycle. Possible negative: One time when he has the clown shoes on at the carnival and he kicks a group of thugs; I'm wondering was that supposed to hurt?! It depends on whether those are regular clown shoes or not. Maybe if he had steel toes or something like that, but he couldn't prepare for a fight that he didn't know would take place at the moment that its happening and, still, there is also logic that a warrior always comes prepared to fight(Chuck Norris always wears the cowboy boots on Walker...). Best scenes of the movie: clown fight at the carnival and the fight at the very end. This one gets 4.6 out of 5, which rounds to 5. A fun and powerful film(great message about changing or turning your back on the wrongs in your life--namely racism). From owner of the movie.

387076,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,6303865496,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[3, 3]","Overall, theBest of the Bestseries is one of the most enjoyable martial arts franchises in film. It took two movies before tae kwon do bigshot Phillip Rhee was properly established as the real star of the story, and I'm pleased to say that even in the disappointing absence of Eric Roberts & co., he proves to be a solid solo action hero, not to mention a better first-time director than his more-recognized cohorts Seagal and Van Damme. It's a bit strange that he chose a story dealing with domestic racial terrorism as his first project, but while not perfect, I think it came out much better than anyone could have expected.The story: following the events of thethe second film, Tommy Lee (Rhee) rides into a rural town besieged by a neo-Nazi militia. When their violent mania takes its toll on the family of his brother-in-law (Christopher McDonald,Requiem for a Dream) and his new romantic interest (Gina Gershon,Face/Off), he uses his championship-caliber martial arts skills to fight back.Neo-Nazism, neo-Confederatism, and white supremicism remain lingering social problems, but while they've been tackled before in drama form (e.g.American History X), I'm pretty sure that Phillip Rhee is the first filmmaker to make an action film that predominantly dealt with the issue. It's a movie decision that you'd expect Steven Seagal to make, and it's quite possible that despite this one's strong production values, the storyline is what kept it from getting a theatrical release. It's kind of heavy-handed, with a rather tasteless scene early on wherein the militant leader (played by great villain-actor Mark Rolston,The Shawshank Redemption) beats a black activist priest to death with a baseball bat, but the film does make a point of differentiating between the racial separatism ideology and racial warfare, as well as depicting the kind of social hopelessness that can lead some folks to grasp at extremes. Still, it's an action flick, so don't expect a completely empathetic movie.Speaking of action, this one's offering is pretty darn good, being mostly limited to four fights and an explosion-filled invasion scene. During his relatively short career, Phillip Rhee was one of the most consistent martial arts performers, and his outing here helps build this reputation. During three one-against-many fights and a single one-on-one brawl with bad guy Rolston, Rhee goes through an encyclopedia of strikes and throws, for the most part exquisitely choreographed and competently filmed. The showdown at the end sort of disappointed me for its change of pace, but by most standards, it's still pretty good, and it doesn't deter from the glorious scene in the first half of the film wherein Rhee - dressed as a clown - takes on a bunch of brutes at a fair. The segment wherein Rhee and Christopher McDonald launch an attack on the supremacists' base is also pretty good, practically atCommandolevels of explosions. There are even parts with motorcycles and a rocket launcher.The cast and their performances round off the good parts of the movie. Along with the aforementioned members, an uncredited R. Lee Ermey (Full Metal Jacket) plays a racist pastor with his usual infectious talent, and Peter Simmons (Renaissance Man) gives a pretty good performance as young supremacist recruit with mixed feelings about his actions. The fact that the film only connects with its prequels via a minute's exposition is somewhat disappointing - I'd have liked to see the ending of the last movie weigh in more on the events of this one - but Rhee proves himself such a consummate performer that you don't miss the other characters *too* much. This one could technically stand alone, but it still feels like a part of the series. Action fans should definitely give it a try.",4,"""Now let's see what color your blood is...""",1355443200,"12 14, 2012",2012,3769,"['Overall', 'theBest', 'Bestseries', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'martial', 'arts', 'franchises', 'film', 'took', 'two', 'movies', 'tae', 'kwon', 'do', 'bigshot', 'Phillip', 'Rhee', 'was', 'properly', 'established', 'real', 'star', 'story', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'say', 'even', 'disappointing', 'absence', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'co.', 'be', 'solid', 'solo', 'action', 'hero', 'not', 'mention', 'better', 'first-time', 'director', 'more-recognized', 'cohorts', 'Seagal', 'Van', 'Damme', 'bit', 'strange', 'chose', 'story', 'dealing', 'domestic', 'racial', 'terrorism', 'first', 'project', 'not', 'perfect', 'think', 'came', 'out', 'much', 'better', 'anyone', 'could', 'have', 'expected.The', 'story', 'following', 'events', 'thethe', 'second', 'film', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Rhee', 'rural', 'town', 'besieged', 'neo-Nazi', 'militia', 'When', 'violent', 'mania', 'toll', 'family', 'brother-in-law', 'Christopher', 'McDonald', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'new', 'romantic', 'interest', 'Gina', 'Gershon', 'Face/Off', 'championship-caliber', 'martial', 'arts', 'skills', 'fight', 'back.Neo-Nazism', 'neo-Confederatism', 'white', 'supremicism', 'remain', 'lingering', 'social', 'problems', ""'ve"", 'been', 'tackled', 'drama', 'form', 'e.g.American', 'History', 'X', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'Phillip', 'Rhee', 'first', 'filmmaker', 'make', 'action', 'film', 'predominantly', 'issue', 'movie', 'decision', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'make', 'quite', 'possible', 'one', 'strong', 'production', 'values', 'storyline', 'what', 'kept', 'getting', 'theatrical', 'release', 'kind', 'heavy-handed', 'rather', 'tasteless', 'scene', 'early', 'militant', 'leader', 'played', 'great', 'villain-actor', 'Mark', 'Rolston', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'black', 'activist', 'priest', 'death', 'baseball', 'bat', 'film', 'make', 'point', 'differentiating', 'racial', 'separatism', 'ideology', 'racial', 'warfare', 'as', 'well', 'depicting', 'kind', 'social', 'hopelessness', 'can', 'lead', 'folks', 'grasp', 'extremes', 'Still', 'action', 'flick', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'completely', 'empathetic', 'movie.Speaking', 'action', 'one', 'offering', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'being', 'mostly', 'limited', 'four', 'fights', 'explosion-filled', 'invasion', 'scene', 'relatively', 'short', 'career', 'Phillip', 'Rhee', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'consistent', 'martial', 'arts', 'performers', 'outing', 'here', 'build', 'reputation', 'three', 'one-against-many', 'fights', 'single', 'one-on-one', 'brawl', 'bad', 'guy', 'Rolston', 'Rhee', 'encyclopedia', 'strikes', 'throws', 'most', 'part', 'exquisitely', 'choreographed', 'competently', 'filmed', 'showdown', 'end', 'sort', 'disappointed', 'change', 'pace', 'most', 'standards', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', ""n't"", 'deter', 'glorious', 'scene', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'wherein', 'Rhee', 'dressed', 'clown', 'bunch', 'brutes', 'fair', 'segment', 'wherein', 'Rhee', 'Christopher', 'McDonald', 'attack', 'supremacists', 'base', 'also', 'pretty', 'good', 'practically', 'atCommandolevels', 'explosions', 'are', 'even', 'parts', 'motorcycles', 'rocket', 'launcher.The', 'cast', 'performances', 'round', 'good', 'parts', 'movie', 'aforementioned', 'members', 'uncredited', 'R.', 'Lee', 'Ermey', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'racist', 'pastor', 'usual', 'infectious', 'talent', 'Peter', 'Simmons', 'Renaissance', 'Man', 'pretty', 'good', 'performance', 'young', 'supremacist', 'recruit', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'actions', 'fact', 'film', 'only', 'prequels', 'minute', 'exposition', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', ""'d"", 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'ending', 'last', 'movie', 'weigh', 'more', 'events', 'one', 'Rhee', 'consummate', 'performer', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'other', 'characters', '*too*', 'much', 'one', 'could', 'technically', 'stand', 'alone', 'still', 'part', 'series', 'Action', 'fans', 'should', 'definitely', 'give', 'try']",Best of the Best 3 VHS
