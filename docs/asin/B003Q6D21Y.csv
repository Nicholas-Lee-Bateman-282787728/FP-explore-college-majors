Michael Douglas does a good job with this role... he is pretty much a man in denial and refuses to go to the doctor (for 6 yrs) once they tell him there is an abnormality on his EKG. He starts living his life the way he wants to and being with who he wants to. Something happens to him one night that you could say changes his life cause since that one night, he pretty much stops being a player.. i'm not going to give away what happens. you will have to find out if you watch it. this is a drama/comedy. very funny. only giving it 3 stars cuz it wasn't off the charts for me, but it was an entertaining rental.",3,i thought it was spose to be a drama,1294444800,"01 8, 2011",2011,691,"['i', 'thought', 'was', 'spose', 'be', 'drama', 'i', 'laughed', 'head', 'movie', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'good', 'job', 'role', 'pretty', 'much', 'man', 'denial', 'go', 'doctor', '6', 'yrs', 'once', 'tell', 'abnormality', 'EKG', 'living', 'life', 'way', 'being', 'who', 'Something', 'happens', 'one', 'night', 'could', 'say', 'changes', 'life', 'cause', 'one', 'night', 'pretty', 'much', 'stops', 'being', 'player..', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'give', 'away', 'what', 'will', 'have', 'find', 'out', 'watch', 'drama/comedy', 'very', 'funny', 'only', 'giving', '3', 'stars', 'cuz', 'was', ""n't"", 'charts', 'was', 'entertaining', 'rental']",N/A

However he still has one thing going for him that is his ability to attract women. He is dating a younger influential woman who is helping him get back in to the limelight but manages to destroy this relationship by entering in to a complicated relationship with his daughter. In short this guy is toxic and so pathetic that his own family starts to give up on him. Down and out, with no one to help him, he is forced to take up a job at a diner run by his old friend.I found the movie to be very well acted and enhanced by witty writing along with some brilliant scenes. The supporting casts are great such as Susan Sarandon, Mary-Louise Parker, Jenna Fischer and Danny DeVito but are underutilized. However the lead Michael Douglas outshines them all. The film was a great as a rough sketch of a individuals meltdown and reflection on the brevity of life, which seems to be ironic for Douglas who himself has been diagnosed with throat cancer.Michael Douglas acts brilliantly in all the scenes whether it is trying to woo a younger girl, dishing out sex advice and talking to his wife and daughter, and this movie showcases his ability to carry the movie on his shoulders. This could be the reason that other performers may seem insignificant.Four stars.11/09/10",4,Michael Douglas shines,1289347200,"11 10, 2010",2010,1448,"['Ben', 'Kalman', 'downhill', 'successful', 'career', 'car', 'dealer', 'went', 'up', 'flames', 'due', 'scandal', 'found', 'living', 'kindness', 'friends', 'relatives', 'However', 'still', 'one', 'thing', 'going', 'ability', 'attract', 'women', 'dating', 'younger', 'influential', 'woman', 'who', 'helping', 'get', 'back', 'limelight', 'destroy', 'relationship', 'entering', 'complicated', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'short', 'guy', 'toxic', 'so', 'pathetic', 'own', 'family', 'give', 'up', 'Down', 'one', 'help', 'forced', 'take', 'up', 'job', 'diner', 'run', 'old', 'friend.I', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'enhanced', 'witty', 'writing', 'along', 'brilliant', 'scenes', 'supporting', 'casts', 'are', 'great', 'such', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'Jenna', 'Fischer', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'are', 'underutilized', 'However', 'lead', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'rough', 'sketch', 'individuals', 'meltdown', 'reflection', 'brevity', 'life', 'be', 'ironic', 'Douglas', 'who', 'been', 'diagnosed', 'throat', 'cancer.Michael', 'Douglas', 'brilliantly', 'scenes', 'trying', 'woo', 'younger', 'girl', 'dishing', 'out', 'sex', 'advice', 'talking', 'wife', 'daughter', 'movie', 'ability', 'carry', 'movie', 'shoulders', 'could', 'be', 'reason', 'other', 'performers', 'may', 'seem', 'insignificant.Four', 'stars.11/09/10']",N/A

The gods themselves smiled and brought this star on america. He is a study in contrasts,the son of a very famous film star,a very different type person from his father,he has rose to tremendous heights as a film star. There are many dvd colections of his work available,including his streets of san francisco tv show testifying to this. The movie he stars in here is the study of a rich man,who rose to be pictured on the cover of Forbes,and then leaves his wife(this is told in an expository way rather than dramatised)and then his life begins to disintegrate from the very heights of all that the american rich business man has at his disposal to squalor...a study in contrasts of living in american society and this makes the film interesting and he plays the film as always giving his all and he's great here! We begin the film with his character at his nadir,undergoing heart tests and about to take a joba as a car dealer. Unfortunately a person on the way down never gets the job both personally and socially and it effects him professionally and as the film shows rather than dealing with this problem realistically,by manipulating the external world he deals with it on a fantasy level as an adolescent,by dealing with them at their level,and with a series of sexual adventures with young girls which allow him to redress the distress/frustrations he feels in the adult world. Of course this furthers his decline and he loses his girlfriend by seducing her daughter(the daughter may not like her mother more than like him and destroys her mother's relationship,)he then goes to work in danny devito's restaurant working at the bottom of the economic pyramid,and their scenes are great!A good decision to case devito...the film shows douglas at film's end talking to his wife,discussing his heart ailment and how that too he resolved by a fling with a young girl as he resolves all his problems,as an adolescent rather than the real adult world which increasingly casts him off,makes him an outcast both family and society,in a world which is no longer inclusive to the economic and moral failures...however he is the most likeable character in the film and the best character in this society for he is inclusive and generous and almost christian and the rest of society's successes are stuck up and full of their own sense of self worth..an intersting film at all levels and very indicative of the present world and the kind of peronalities we are producing",4,good character study by michael douglas,1334534400,"04 16, 2012",2012,2646,"['interesting', 'look', 'erstwhile', 'star', 'are', 'so', 'happy', 'well', 'again', 'not', 'only', 'health', 'many', 'films', 'will', 'perform', 'future', 'god', 'willing', 'gods', 'smiled', 'brought', 'star', 'america', 'study', 'contrasts', 'son', 'very', 'famous', 'film', 'star', 'very', 'different', 'type', 'person', 'father', 'rose', 'tremendous', 'heights', 'film', 'star', 'are', 'many', 'dvd', 'colections', 'work', 'available', 'including', 'streets', 'san', 'francisco', 'tv', 'show', 'testifying', 'movie', 'here', 'study', 'rich', 'man', 'who', 'rose', 'be', 'pictured', 'cover', 'Forbes', 'then', 'wife', 'told', 'expository', 'way', 'rather', 'dramatised', 'then', 'life', 'disintegrate', 'very', 'heights', 'american', 'rich', 'business', 'man', 'disposal', 'squalor', 'study', 'contrasts', 'living', 'american', 'society', 'film', 'interesting', 'film', 'always', 'giving', 'great', 'here', 'begin', 'film', 'character', 'nadir', 'undergoing', 'heart', 'tests', 'take', 'joba', 'car', 'dealer', 'Unfortunately', 'person', 'way', 'down', 'never', 'job', 'personally', 'socially', 'effects', 'professionally', 'film', 'rather', 'dealing', 'problem', 'realistically', 'manipulating', 'external', 'world', 'fantasy', 'level', 'adolescent', 'dealing', 'level', 'series', 'sexual', 'adventures', 'young', 'girls', 'allow', 'redress', 'distress/frustrations', 'adult', 'world', 'course', 'decline', 'girlfriend', 'seducing', 'daughter', 'daughter', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'mother', 'more', 'mother', 'relationship', 'then', 'work', 'danny', 'devito', 'restaurant', 'working', 'bottom', 'economic', 'pyramid', 'scenes', 'are', 'great', 'good', 'decision', 'case', 'devito', 'film', 'douglas', 'film', 'end', 'talking', 'wife', 'discussing', 'heart', 'ailment', 'how', 'too', 'resolved', 'fling', 'young', 'girl', 'problems', 'adolescent', 'rather', 'real', 'adult', 'world', 'increasingly', 'off', 'outcast', 'family', 'society', 'world', 'longer', 'inclusive', 'economic', 'moral', 'failures', 'however', 'most', 'likeable', 'character', 'film', 'best', 'character', 'society', 'inclusive', 'generous', 'almost', 'christian', 'rest', 'society', 'successes', 'are', 'stuck', 'up', 'full', 'own', 'sense', 'self', 'worth..an', 'intersting', 'film', 'levels', 'very', 'indicative', 'present', 'world', 'kind', 'peronalities', 'are', 'producing']",N/A
1357095,A1OHEM9J2QTX0R,B003Q6D21Y,A. Whitney,"[1, 1]","Michael Douglas shines in his performance as Ben, a salesman whose biggest sale has been convincing himself that he can cheat death and irrelevance by bedding young women, and manipulating the system for his gain. When we meet him in the story, he believes that he is achieving his goal even though every sign around him indicates that is not true. While he wants to remain vital and successful the real relationships (with his ex-wife, his daughter, his grandson, his integrity as a businessman) have all withered. Instead he looks to meaningless one-night stands, a swapping scheme that had cost him his business and some time in jail, and a superficial relationship with a woman who he is using to get his foot in the door for another business.As the story develops, the ramifications of Ben's poor decisions make it impossible to ignore that he is going in the wrong direction. With the help of an old friend (Danny Devito- who could have been used more effectively) he makes an attempt to make things right. The ambiguous ending allows the viewer to interpret his last act, which may be annoying to those who would rather be told what happens. But how we viewers figure the ending may have a lot with how we felt about his earnestness and the impact of what happened.Douglas delivers a solid performance, although I'm with other reviewers in thinking that while he may be good, it's hard to believe that he's *that* good in seducing any woman he fancies. Susan Sarandon has a light but necessary role and I wish we could have seen more of her. Jenna Fischer is convincing as his fed-up daughter, but I would have liked to see more from Danny Devito as the friend that tries to help Ben find his moral compass again.",3,Engrossing Performance by Douglas,1289692800,"11 14, 2010",2010,1720,"['Michael', 'Douglas', 'shines', 'performance', 'Ben', 'salesman', 'biggest', 'sale', 'been', 'convincing', 'can', 'cheat', 'death', 'irrelevance', 'bedding', 'young', 'women', 'manipulating', 'system', 'gain', 'When', 'meet', 'story', 'achieving', 'goal', 'even', 'sign', 'not', 'true', 'remain', 'vital', 'successful', 'real', 'relationships', 'ex-wife', 'daughter', 'grandson', 'integrity', 'businessman', 'have', 'withered', 'Instead', 'meaningless', 'one-night', 'stands', 'swapping', 'scheme', 'had', 'cost', 'business', 'time', 'jail', 'superficial', 'relationship', 'woman', 'who', 'using', 'get', 'foot', 'door', 'business.As', 'story', 'ramifications', 'Ben', 'poor', 'decisions', 'make', 'impossible', 'ignore', 'going', 'wrong', 'direction', 'help', 'old', 'friend', 'Danny', 'Devito-', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'more', 'effectively', 'attempt', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'viewer', 'interpret', 'last', 'act', 'may', 'be', 'annoying', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'told', 'what', 'how', 'viewers', 'figure', 'ending', 'may', 'have', 'lot', 'how', 'felt', 'earnestness', 'impact', 'what', 'happened.Douglas', 'solid', 'performance', ""'m"", 'other', 'reviewers', 'thinking', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'hard', 'believe', '*that*', 'good', 'seducing', 'woman', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'light', 'necessary', 'role', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'Jenna', 'Fischer', 'convincing', 'fed-up', 'daughter', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'Danny', 'Devito', 'friend', 'help', 'Ben', 'find', 'moral', 'compass', 'again']",N/A
1357096,A30TQET02FLSUX,B003Q6D21Y,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[2, 3]","I chose to watch Michael Douglas' Solitary Man (2009) on DVD this week. I've read some good reviews for the film this year as well as heard good things about it. And the movie definitely did not disappoint. It's a very good character-driven dramedy (3.5 stars out of 5). There's more comedy in it than you would expect. The story of Solitary Man centers around Michael Douglas' character Ben Kalmen, a single, divorced, father/grandfather whose life changes after he goes to the doctor for a physical and hears concern about his health. Ben doesn't want to know any news about his health...period. He's in control of his life and isn't going to let some doctor change that. So he ignores the doctor's request for further tests and instead starts taking big risks with all areas of his life, simply to make sure he goes out with a bang. After years of being the honest and steady Lion at the top of his game, both in terms of his career and his love life, now things are changing for Ben. His ex-wife Nancy, played with great finesse by Susan Sarandon, still loves him...and would take him back if Ben wanted that. But Ben doesn't know what he wants. We follow Ben through the movie as he continues to screw (both literally and figuratively) with his life and the remaining people in it.One of my favorite scenes from the film is between Douglas and Sarandon. While visiting his ex-wife Nancy to ask for her help, Ben notices that she hasn't changed anything in the condo where the two of them used to live together. Not even the pillows on the old sofa. In response, Nancy says to Ben: ""I don't change things when they're still working. That's your move."" And with those tart words, Ben is reminded of his failures.It's fun and a bit painful to watch Douglas play this character at this stage in his career. Just like Ben, Douglas was at the top of his acting game in movies for many years. But he's gone through a similar phase in his own life, taking risks that didn't pay off, simply losing status as he got older, and now fighting health concerns (he was recently diagnosed with very serious throat cancer). But Solitary Man is a return of Douglas to his glory days of acting. You just can't help but like the guy (both his character and the actor). We even get a little movie nostalgia with the cameo appearance of Danny DeVito as Ben's old, and last, friend, who takes him in when he desperately needs some place to stay. DeVito and Douglas' on screen chemistry harkens back to the days of Romancing the Stone (1984) and The Jewel of the Nile (1995). It's a great role for DeVito and reminds me what a talented actor he is, especially when given well-written roles.Many of us, myself included, have had similar experiences of falling from our perches as Kings-of-the-Hill in our careers due to the last few years of the Great Recession. And I think the timeliness of this film is very appropriate. Even though Ben is 30 years my senior, I really related to him as he watches the things that he spent many years building, fall apart. It's tough to start over as we get older. After a certain point, life tends to favor youth when it comes to new opportunities and change. But anything is possible. And Solitary Man leaves you wondering what will happen next for Ben...as well as for yourself.",3,"""I don't change things when they're still working.

He walked out of the doctor's office and has never seen a doctor since.  He also tore his life completely apart.  He had a been an ultra successful entrepreneur and family man and promptly went nuts as both a womanizer and then a crook.

It wasn't lost on me that, like Johnny Cash, Michael Douglas' character also began wearing all-black at a certain point in the film. And the color had as much to do with the darkness of the main character's mindset through most of the movie as it did the connection to the song title.The story unfolds as some troubling health news causes Douglas' character to rebel psychologically into a solitude (caused be anything but solitude) that aims to reinvent a piece of who he was in order to ""cure"" who he thinks he is becoming...and is then forced to explore which piece of him, in reality, is actually better.The character development is fabulous with Douglas playing a very ""real"" man in rebellion of the inevitable and Susan Sarandon showing realistic traits of an ex-wife to Douglas' character...because she expresses well both a perfect balance of compassion and confusion in the wake left by her formerly loving and successful husband's new life and choices.Douglas played a tough role...because there was an edge about him that was far too cocky, yet it isn't a character you hate. He walked a fine line (yes, that Johnny Cash song title was inserted on purpose!) very well in remaining watchable with splashes of warmth while the viewer also feels cringes of both pity and despise in various scenes as his choices of regaining his youth and power lead him to an unexpected place.Danny DeVito also plays well the part of an old friend who holds up an interesting psychological mirror to Douglas' life at one point in the film where their expectations of each other from youth actually traded places and provided clarity. And Jenna Fischer, from the ""Office"" also provided the same tale of a an exchange from daughter to guardian of another at one point. In fact, all characters had circles of development.The ending is one that will leave you discussing your take on it and why. And for that, it makes a great movie to watch with others for any movie night with friends.This story of moving both backwards and forward with roller-coaster-sized life bumps was one I'd highly recommend as the acting and character development made this a ""two thumbs up"" unanimous decision for the 6 person movie night at our home.",5,"Great character development, kept us interested from start to end",1286236800,"10 5, 2010",2010,2282,"['Solitary', 'Man', 'originally', 'song', 'title', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'tune', 'was', ""n't"", 'lost', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'character', 'also', 'began', 'wearing', 'all-black', 'certain', 'point', 'film', 'color', 'had', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'darkness', 'main', 'character', 'mindset', 'most', 'movie', 'did', 'connection', 'song', 'title.The', 'story', 'unfolds', 'troubling', 'health', 'news', 'Douglas', 'character', 'rebel', 'psychologically', 'solitude', 'caused', 'be', 'anything', 'solitude', 'reinvent', 'piece', 'who', 'was', 'order', 'cure', 'who', 'becoming', 'then', 'forced', 'explore', 'piece', 'reality', 'actually', 'better.The', 'character', 'development', 'fabulous', 'Douglas', 'playing', 'very', 'real', 'man', 'rebellion', 'inevitable', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'showing', 'realistic', 'traits', 'ex-wife', 'Douglas', 'character', 'well', 'perfect', 'balance', 'compassion', 'confusion', 'wake', 'left', 'formerly', 'loving', 'successful', 'husband', 'new', 'life', 'choices.Douglas', 'played', 'tough', 'role', 'was', 'edge', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'cocky', ""n't"", 'character', 'hate', 'walked', 'fine', 'line', 'yes', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'song', 'title', 'was', 'inserted', 'purpose', 'very', 'well', 'remaining', 'watchable', 'splashes', 'warmth', 'viewer', 'also', 'cringes', 'pity', 'despise', 'various', 'scenes', 'choices', 'regaining', 'youth', 'power', 'lead', 'unexpected', 'place.Danny', 'DeVito', 'also', 'well', 'part', 'old', 'friend', 'who', 'up', 'interesting', 'psychological', 'mirror', 'Douglas', 'life', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'where', 'expectations', 'other', 'youth', 'actually', 'traded', 'places', 'provided', 'clarity', 'Jenna', 'Fischer', 'Office', 'also', 'provided', 'same', 'tale', 'exchange', 'daughter', 'guardian', 'one', 'point', 'fact', 'characters', 'had', 'circles', 'development.The', 'ending', 'one', 'will', 'leave', 'discussing', 'take', 'why', 'great', 'movie', 'watch', 'others', 'movie', 'night', 'friends.This', 'story', 'moving', 'backwards', 'forward', 'roller-coaster-sized', 'life', 'bumps', 'was', 'one', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'acting', 'character', 'development', 'made', 'two', 'thumbs', 'up', 'unanimous', 'decision', '6', 'person', 'movie', 'night', 'home']",N/A

The character Douglas plays has some very bad behaviors yet I don't know many men his age who have the looks or charm to get in as much trouble as he does.  The story plays at least two ways.  The easy way is to say this guy is a sleaze who takes advantage of innocent and angelic women, and ends up ostracized for being a predator.But then I thought it over.  There's something rather appealing about a guy who decides he's reached an age where any medical test will likely have a disappointing outcome.  So he decides to live his life to the fullest, which for him means selling cars and rolling in the hay.  And deprived of the opportunity to sell cars, all that remains is the other thing!  So yes, he is selfish and hurtful but he is also funny, adventurous, articulate and resourceful.  He's everything women love except honest and reliable.  True, these are very serious flaws but he doesn't suffer from the one thing no woman can overlook:  he isn't dull.At the end, I had a hard time seeing this ""live fast, die old"" approach to life as a morality tale when our lonely car salesman ends up faced with the choice of chasing more 19-year olds (probably successfully) or being ""stuck"" with Susan Sarandon.

I'm not going to cover that ground again. I just want to say that the character he plays is not the only ""pitiful"" or ""pathetic"" one in this film. Other than cameos by Danny Devito as the old college chum and Susan Sarandon as the wife he left for the proverbial younger woman, there are no shining examples of good behavior in ""Solitary Man.""Unlike in Douglas' tour de force, ""Fatal Attraction,"" those hoping for some wonderful bum shots are not going to get them; but the woman scorned in ""Solitary Man"" is still a nightmare. First, she pushes him into taking her daughter for admission interviews at his old college, to use his ""pull"" to get her in. Was it such a surprise that the daughter turned out to be as jaded and manipulative as her mother? And what does the man do after this young woman goes out of her way to yank his in-denial chain? Predictably, they wind up in bed with each other (two consenting adults) and that should have been the end of a tawdry one-night stand.[Cue Devito as Louie DePalma: ""But, NOOOOOOOO!""]The daughter goes out of her way to spill the beans to her mother in a vicious little vignette, and then the woman scorned goes out of her way to visciously trash what's left of his life. It just takes a few angry phone calls, and agreements he was counting on are summarily withdrawn and he is treated like scum by everyone except the only two friends he has. One has to wonder what was going on between the mother and daughter and if the daughter did not set up the whole thing to get back at her mother for some slight. The movie could have been stronger had this been explored a little more deeply, but viewers can use their imaginations as to motive.Douglas' character is not a sympathetic one, mind you, and he's not the brightest bulb when it comes to relationships--how many men do you know who are?--but he isn't conniving and downright mean. He is like so many middle-aged men who long for (and sometimes act out) their fantasized glory days, some more pathetically than others. Men leaving their wives for girls young enough to be their daughters (or granddaughters) and the mid-life ""red sports car syndrome"" are cliches precisely because the behaviors are so prevalent and (sometimes) laughably predictable.

Hints are dropped that Douglas was involved in some sort of scam that caused him to lose his extremely profitable business and threw him into a scandal that destroyed his reputation. The rising action begins when Douglas must escort his girlfriend's daughter to his alma mater for the weekend. While in Boston, Douglas makes a terrible decision that threatens to unravel whatever life he has left.Though this film received little attention, I thought that it was absolutely excellent and worth an Oscar nomination (being that they're handing them out willy nilly now). Susan Saradon plays Douglas' ex and does so expertly with just the perfect amount of anger, pity, and old love. Douglas plays the philandering 60+ year old who still thinks he's 20 perfectly.

Ben Kalmen (Michael Douglas), who was a successful car dealer, has his life go on the skids after a doctor's appointment hints at possible health problems. Oddly enough he never stays around long enough to find out from the doctor if there really is a problem, and that same night after drinking at a bar, he has the first of many one night affairs with women. From here he jeopardizes not only his marriage but also his business with illegal activities, and it is just one wrong move after another as he unravels his life while attempting to avoid the possible truth that he might soon die. His self destructive behaviour leads to an unstable lifestyle where anything goes, and this is often at the expense of those who respect or love him. It seems he is unable to help himself until he seems to have fallen as far as he can possibly fall.

Brown ""Charisma Expert""","[3, 4]","In ""Solitary Man,"" Michael Douglas portrays the final act of a man who has had it all in life, but has not left the party, before the music stopped.  It's the ultimate choice most men have to make during the aging process, either to remain single and play the field, albeit changing rules, or settle down and embrace simplicity.  For Douglas' character, he ponders this final decision in the last frame of the movie as his ex-wife (Susan Sarandon), who acts as a lifeline, provides him an option--continue waywardly or settle in.  In his vacillation, it is not telling what lies ahead, but he seems to take into account that a change is necessary.  For those who have never questioned the choices life affords us, Douglas seems immature and arrested in his development.  However, the bigger question is, ""How do you break the habits in life that provided the greatest sense of verve and excitement, although reckless?"" The mature adult looks at the big picture, but the picture is not always enthralling.  As gladiators, some boxers would rather die in the ring then be told their best days are behind them.  In Sylvester Stallone's ""Rocky Balboa,"" Rocky still feels he has some ""stuff"" inside him that needs to be expressed in the ring.  Obviously, Rocky's going the distance with a younger, fiercer champion, makes the point that you're never finished as long as you can perform.Michael Douglas' ""Solitary Man"" and ""Rocky Balboa"" are composites of the fear and lose from getting older.  In this regard, the Youth Culture doesn't win, but merely creates a schism between the young at heart and the man in the mirror.I recommend this movie as a reflection of the ultimate in life choices.Edward BrownCore Edge Image & Charisma Institute",3,Life's Ultimate Decision!,1284940800,"09 20, 2010",2010,1736,"['Solitary', 'Man', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'final', 'act', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'all', 'life', 'not', 'left', 'party', 'music', 'stopped', 'ultimate', 'choice', 'most', 'men', 'have', 'make', 'aging', 'process', 'remain', 'single', 'play', 'field', 'changing', 'rules', 'settle', 'down', 'embrace', 'simplicity', 'Douglas', 'character', 'final', 'decision', 'last', 'frame', 'movie', 'ex-wife', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'who', 'lifeline', 'option', 'continue', 'waywardly', 'settle', 'vacillation', 'not', 'telling', 'what', 'ahead', 'take', 'account', 'change', 'necessary', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'questioned', 'choices', 'life', 'affords', 'Douglas', 'immature', 'arrested', 'development', 'However', 'bigger', 'question', 'How', 'do', 'break', 'habits', 'life', 'provided', 'greatest', 'sense', 'verve', 'excitement', 'reckless', 'mature', 'adult', 'big', 'picture', 'picture', 'not', 'always', 'enthralling', 'gladiators', 'boxers', 'would', 'rather', 'die', 'ring', 'then', 'be', 'told', 'best', 'days', 'are', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'Rocky', 'still', 'stuff', 'be', 'expressed', 'ring', 'Obviously', 'Rocky', 'going', 'distance', 'younger', 'fiercer', 'champion', 'point', ""'re"", 'never', 'finished', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'perform.Michael', 'Douglas', 'Solitary', 'Man', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'are', 'composites', 'fear', 'lose', 'getting', 'older', 'regard', 'Youth', 'Culture', ""n't"", 'win', 'merely', 'schism', 'young', 'heart', 'man', 'mirror.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'reflection', 'ultimate', 'life', 'choices.Edward', 'BrownCore', 'Edge', 'Image', 'Charisma', 'Institute']",N/A

I thought I'd give it a go--after all there's always the off button.Solitary Man is an excellent character study of Ben Kalmen (Michael Douglas). At one time he was married, and a very successful care salesman, but he's now on a slippery slope both professionally and personally. He cheated on his real estate agent wife Nancy (Susan Sarandon) and his relationship with his daughter Susan (Jenna Fischer) is problematic--no doubt due to the fact she's not supposed to call him dad in public. Divorced and now financially insolvent, he's trying to make a come back by sewing up a deal & getting financial help through his affluent girlfriend Jordan's (Mary-Louise Parker) influence.Kalmen is a chronic womanizer; he's glib, and he still has what it takes. He can sell himself probably just as well as he can sell a car, but while he's right on the edge of being able to recoup his life, he's also right on the edge of going under. He can still pull the deals and the women, but when he insists on setting his sights on eighteen year olds, only bad things can happen.  Character is fate, after all.I've known some Kalmen types, and Solitary Man has this character down perfectly. Michael Douglas is terrific in this role--there's one point when he's visiting his ex-wife, hitting her up for money and he can't help but slide in a dig about the fact that she didn't change the furniture after he left. His wife's response is well-timed and the camera catches Douglas's naked (and momentarily) honest reaction for just a couple of seconds.4 stars for a great, entertaining film.

1357120,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003Q6D21Y,Grady Harp,"[5, 5]","SOLITARY MAN is either a depressing movie or a movie about a depressing society - until the film is over and afterthoughts dredge up memories of very similar people. Then it simply becomes a Greek tragedy. Writer Brian Koppelman introduces a character that is all charm and faade who begins to take himself seriously (believing the false front that has lead him to a 'successful' life) after a routine physician's check up reveals an abnormal EKG.  Facing the ultimate fragility of life and the insight that his last years may be approaching more rapidly than he ever thought possible, our 'hero' begins a downhill skid and the effects.  It is a march that is sad to watch, but due to the sensitivity of  directors Brian Koppelman and David Levien and to the impressive performance by Michael Douglas, it stays imprinted on the brain long after the film's subtle ending fades.Ben Kalman (Michael Douglas) is the person of interest in this story, a man who six years prior to the opening of the film is informed of his mortality, and in the last six years this car dealer has gone form disposing of his honest reputation to the point of participating in scams, being arrested, bedding every 19 year old girl he can, losing his money, divorcing his wife (Susan Sarandon), losing the respect of his daughter (Jenny Fischer) whose husband requests she not see her father nor expose their son to him, cheating on his girlfriend with important family ties (Mary Louise Parker) by inappropriate activity with her daughter (Imogen Poots), and being refused financing despite his friend (Ben Schenkman) attempts on his behalf.  He finally ends up on the campus where he met his wife, meets a shy student (Jesse Eisenberg) and in attempting to give him lessons about how to attract women unveils an even more ugly aspect of his position, and finally meets up with his only friend from college days - the local pub man (Danny DeVito) who may never have reached the heights of Ben but has remained an honest and caring friend.  How all of these errors of judgment and despicable behavior catch up with him frames an ending for the film - one that leaves the audience to decide if he has indeed learned form his missteps.Not a happy story and while billed as a comedy/drama, it is the drama that usurps the comedy.  Michael Douglas hands this role with complete involvement: would that we could only care about his character.  The stars attached to the cast give excellent cameos.

To see a very successful man descend into the bottom is hard to watch.  Especially as it reminds us that no matter how high you get and how wealthy you become, you can lose everything if you don't behave.The themes and plot can be a bit clich&eacute; at times such as a health scare triggers a man to begin his decent into loser-ville or that true friends and family are the only people you can rely on in life.  I'm not entirely convince that the plot is believable as I doubt that anyone would so stupid as to behave in a way that would cause them to lose everything over a undiagnosed medical condition.  Especially those who have worked hard their entire lives and have obtained the pinnacle of success.  How anyone can believe an individual such as that would destroy what he's built or become a completely different person after many decades is beyond me.

All I knew was that Michael Douglas was in it, and that most likely he was this ""Solitary Man"" that the title mentions.-The IDEA of this movie is better than the movie itself.  Before watching this movie, you probably envision (as did I) Michael Douglas's character ending up as this ""Solitary Man"" and trying to redeem himself, or otherwise coming to some conclusion about his life.  And this movie sort of starts on that path, but then becomes completely lost.  It's like it gets about 1/4 of the way there, then just gives up.-The movie starts off promising: We learn that Michael Douglas's character is a charming, fast-talking, not-so-nice guy, backed by the awesome Johnny Cash song as the same name of the movie (Great song, by the way).  So - you think - OK, this is going somewhere, we're gonna follow this guy around and see what happens.  But NOTHING does!  I could go on to explain it, but I don't like giving anything away, not that I'm recommending that you see it anyhow!-There are a lot of famous people in this movie - all of whom play these bit parts throughout the film.  But NONE of them are convincing, and it feels like some director is friends with them all and convinced them to put in a few days work on this low-budget film.  It all felt very disjointed and fake.--* Spoilers below, maybe! *--We sort of follow Michael Douglas around for a few years and he's just a bad person with no real redeeming qualities.  I don't see how anyone watching the film would be able to relate to his character, or care about what he is going through - he's just a despicable character.  His life just goes downhill, and just gets progressively worse.  This type of movie can only end in one of two ways: and it didn't go the way I was HOPING it would, which would have been a bad choice anyhow - but they went an even WORSE direction, which just leaves you feeling cheated having been made to sit through this thing!-The DVD itself is fine - good quality - no artifacts or pixelation that I could detect.  It also has a decent making-of featurette - but since I didn't like the movie, I didn't bother watching the whole thing.-So, to sum it up, yeah I like watching Michael Douglas on screen, because he has that wonderful presence.

1357125,AES7RYBQDI2T2,B003Q6D21Y,Kari Murphy,"[2, 2]","Great performance by Douglas! I really enjoyed this movie...mostly because Michael Douglas, IMHO, has inherited more than a name...he has the enhanced genes of theatrical greatness, but has chosen to be subtle and dignified with his work...he doesn't try to be in every movie out there, but seeks roles where the gloves fit...amazing in his ability to be a likeable bad guy...who finds redemption before the end of the spool...Solitary Man is very apropros of coping mechanisms by ""old school machismo"" (distinguishes itself from the comedic senior buddy movies out there.) So, Douglas's character ""Kalman"" has a history of building empires, yet is paralyzingly terrified of his own mortality. Hearing news, about his own fragile health is so unpalatable, that he he wreaks havoc by seducing every female who is at least 25 years or more his junior...His seductions, initially humorous, with an engaging path of risk and consequence, soon turn sour as it obviously becomes his ruin. The Douglas character is very believable when he allows his overcharged libido to avoid real life. The misogyny and objectification of women is curious, especially with the most precious relationship he has...the one with his daughter and grandchild.""Kalman's"" Casanovian charms with women become predictable and revolting, though Douglas' character is magnetically charismatic with energy unparalled for someone of his years. The man shines and walks with the swaggering confidence of someone who will never cease to light up the room.Nicely supported by the rest of the cast...who are superb in their peripheral roles.

1357126,A17DCPYMLXV1S4,B003Q6D21Y,Kay Shackleton,"[1, 1]","Michael Douglas has had a very difficult year. Two films have been released this year that showcase some of his best work. Yet, there is no celebrating to be done while Douglas fights stage-four throat cancer. His returning role as Gordon Gekko in Oliver Stone's film Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps was highly anticipated and if it weren't for a disappointing ending could have been his crowning achievement in his career. But Douglas had another film released this year that I believe is one of his best performance in many years, and a performance that should not be missed.Michael Douglas stars in Solitary Man. The film starts with Douglas walking the streets of New York as Johnny Cash sings the song with the same title. We find that Douglas' character, Ben Kalmen, becomes a solitary man of his own design. Just one concern regarding his health uttered by his physician sends Ben down a road of self-destruction. His successful business and loving family become just part of his collateral damage. Kalmen becomes an over-aged man searching the young and even younger women to somehow reverse his own aging. Fortunately, is ex-wife Nancy, played by Susan Sarandon, is supportive although detached from her ex-husband's escapades. His daughter, played by Jenna Fischer, finds more difficulty loving a father who's unstable and unable to grandparent her son.What makes this role and his performance playing it so important and timely, is a theme that most men of a certain age can relate to. Kalmen isn't a bigger-than-life character and Douglas brings authenticity to the role of a man trying to recapture and grander life. His on-screen pick-ups are interesting at first, but ultimately sad and bewildering. Kalmen doesn't seem to understand the word ""no,"" and his own destructive actions continue to destroy any possible redemption. Ultimately, it is Nancy he turns to when all is lost, and still then he is unable to discern the appropriate path to take becoming again a solitary man...""I'll be what I amA solitary manSolitary man,""""Solitary Man,"" written by Neil DiamondThe Buzz: This film may be overlooked at award time due to its low box office numbers, but if Michael Douglas is noticed during award season this is the film that should be given acclaim.Solitary Man is rated R for language and some sexual contentand has a run time of 1 hr. 30 min.For more reviews by Kay Shackleton see: [...]",5,Solitary Man - one of Michael Douglas' best films - ever!,1288656000,"11 2, 2010",2010,2407,"['Michael', 'Douglas', 'had', 'very', 'difficult', 'year', 'Two', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'year', 'showcase', 'best', 'work', 'celebrating', 'be', 'done', 'Douglas', 'fights', 'stage-four', 'throat', 'cancer', 'returning', 'role', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'film', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Money', 'Never', 'Sleeps', 'was', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'were', ""n't"", 'disappointing', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'career', 'Douglas', 'had', 'film', 'released', 'year', 'believe', 'one', 'best', 'performance', 'many', 'years', 'performance', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed.Michael', 'Douglas', 'stars', 'Solitary', 'Man', 'film', 'Douglas', 'walking', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'sings', 'song', 'same', 'title', 'find', 'Douglas', 'character', 'Ben', 'Kalmen', 'solitary', 'man', 'own', 'design', 'Just', 'one', 'concern', 'regarding', 'health', 'uttered', 'physician', 'Ben', 'down', 'road', 'self-destruction', 'successful', 'business', 'loving', 'family', 'become', 'just', 'part', 'collateral', 'damage', 'Kalmen', 'over-aged', 'man', 'searching', 'young', 'even', 'younger', 'women', 'somehow', 'reverse', 'own', 'aging', 'Fortunately', 'ex-wife', 'Nancy', 'played', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'supportive', 'detached', 'ex-husband', 'escapades', 'daughter', 'played', 'Jenna', 'Fischer', 'more', 'difficulty', 'loving', 'father', 'who', 'unstable', 'unable', 'grandparent', 'son.What', 'role', 'performance', 'playing', 'so', 'important', 'timely', 'theme', 'most', 'men', 'certain', 'age', 'can', 'relate', 'Kalmen', ""n't"", 'bigger-than-life', 'character', 'Douglas', 'authenticity', 'role', 'man', 'trying', 'recapture', 'grander', 'life', 'on-screen', 'pick-ups', 'are', 'interesting', 'first', 'ultimately', 'sad', 'bewildering', 'Kalmen', ""n't"", 'seem', 'understand', 'word', 'own', 'destructive', 'actions', 'continue', 'destroy', 'possible', 'redemption', 'Ultimately', 'Nancy', 'when', 'lost', 'still', 'then', 'unable', 'discern', 'appropriate', 'path', 'take', 'becoming', 'again', 'solitary', 'man', ""'ll"", 'be', 'what', 'amA', 'solitary', 'manSolitary', 'man', 'Solitary', 'Man', 'written', 'Neil', 'DiamondThe', 'Buzz', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'overlooked', 'award', 'time', 'due', 'low', 'box', 'office', 'numbers', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'noticed', 'award', 'season', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'acclaim.Solitary', 'Man', 'rated', 'R', 'language', 'sexual', 'contentand', 'run', 'time', '1', 'hr', '30', 'min.For', 'more', 'reviews', 'Kay', 'Shackleton', 'see', '[', ']']",N/A
1357127,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,B003Q6D21Y,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[3, 3]","Michael Douglas always holds my attention when his characters are complicated and face moral conflicts or identity issues. In this film, he certainly has his share of personal issues and may strike some viewers as unlikeable, especially for those who like a clear sense of right and wrong or good and evil when it comes to actors shown in films. Of course, humans are imperfect and Douglas reveals a man, Ben, whose flaws are front and center, a man in  the latter half of his life, trying to deal with a failed car dealership, a health scare and more. This is a far cry from action or suspense films featuring Douglas. He isn't exactly a good guy in this film but I found him sympathetic (at times) and pathetic in other scenes (but pathos seemed the intended effect).I was eager to find out how Ben would deal with all the challenges in his life. He is challenged even more when asked to take his girlfriend's daughter to visit Ben's alma mater, a trip destined to have Ben confront his past as well as his current life. It has been a long time since Ben has been to that town and the trip brings back memories, increases his anxiety over aging and his fears about his sexual appeal. He also feels that his former business power and charismatic personality have faded. Douglas is pitch perfect in playing Ben.The movie isn't without some flaws.Some of his actions seem almost intentionally self-destructive. Also, it seems a bit of a stretch to believe that young women would be attracted to a much older man who has neither power, money or even a completely charming personality. Even so, I found this a far more enjoyable film than the ones where nothing is demanded of the viewer but to sit back, watch a predictable action thriller, and munch on popcorn. By the next day, odds are high that the action movie will be forgotten (unless it is extremely well done and explores new territory). ""Solitary Man"" reveals how work and age is contrasted with young and still developing college students who are just starting to decide on their careers.I'm betting that there are enough viewers who have faced similar challenges in their lives - even if they haven't faced as many as Ben. I'm not sure how much attention was given to this movie but it is well worth watching. Just don't expect the kind of tension found in ""Wall Street"" or suspense thrillers. This movie is solidly focused on the characters and the changes in their lives. It is refreshing to see an older man in the main role rather than the young, attractive faces that fill so many films. Douglas is still attractive but it is the look of a man who is seasoned rather than fresh-faced and innocent.",4,Thoroughly enjoyed it but will you?

1357129,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003Q6D21Y,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","No one does loathsome charm like Michael Douglas! In a career filled with oily characters, Ben Kalmen is easily one of the more reprehensible creations that Douglas has fleshed out. Seemingly without one redemptive character trait, ""Solitary Man"" doesn't shy away from the ugliness, desperation, and fear that fuel Kalmen's self destructive bent. And as much as you may despise the man, Douglas manages to convey enough humanity and humor to keep you hoping for more. It's an intricately balanced role and Douglas deftly handles its challenges. If you're not with Douglas for good and bad, than you will likely find ""Solitary Man"" quite unpleasant. Douglas had me, however, and backed by a solid and wildly appealing supporting cast--""Solitary Man"" became an amusingly direct look at a man dealing with his own mortality.With a brief introduction, we meet Douglas as a successful man facing a possible health crisis. Fast forward six years. Douglas is now broke, unemployed and practically unemployable due to a scandal, divorced, and carrying on with a woman for her business connections. He's an aging lothario who seems to be actively working to estrange himself from his family and his closest friends. The thought of not living life on his own terms has caused him to systematically deconstruct everything that was once successful and lovable about his old persona. Douglas is fearless as I mentioned above and his trysts with younger, and some patently inappropriate, women range from comical to quite unsettling. Douglas ultimately does have to start addressing his shortcomings, but is it too little and too late?While Douglas may be difficult to like--he is certainly surrounded by a plethora of people who still care. The film shines in its supporting cast. I'd single out Jenna Fischer (TV's ""The Office"") as Douglas's daughter who in many ways is the heart of this piece and Jesse Eisenberg as a youth idolizing Douglas who is the hope of the film. Both are terrific--perhaps Fischer's best work to date. Mary-Louise Parker, Danny Devito and Susan Sarandon also lend solid support. Ultimately, ""Solitary Man"" may be too slight for some viewers--there are no big declarations and/or revelations.

Peasley,"[1, 2]","Pretty dour by American movie standards; in fact, more like a European arthouse picture, although it does have a very American energy and focus and it ends with a typically American optimism. And it has Michael Douglas, who does Decline better than anybody - with the possible exception of Mickey Rourke. I'd watch Douglas in anything because he has the ability to transform even mundane material; however, if you're not a fan you might skip this one without losing too much sleep. It's slight and fairly predictable although there is some hard-bitten, lacerating dialogue to keep up the interest. The problem is it's not sustained enough; I kept waiting for the knockout blow but it contented itself with jabs and body-shots. And I found the ending too easy for my taste. I had been expecting that Douglas would go out in a blaze of sleaze, uncompromisingly seedy to the end, but American movies seem to feel the need for a dose of Good Cheer to alleviate all the dark stuff. The ending has overtones of Self-Knowledge, Life-Affirmation, Rebirth, and Hope - all very depressing. Moreover, we are given an ""explanation"" for all his bad behaviour. I had been hoping for sheer bloody-mindedness but there you go. Apparently, he had a good reason for treating everybody like garbage.Still, there is always something grand in Douglas's sleaze. It's never small, as it is with everybody else.

Sherwin,"[1, 3]","If you find that Michael Douglas' character Ben Kalman isn't likeable in this film, then he succeeded in doing a superlative job of acting! You're really not supposed to like Ben--except maybe a little as you continue watching the film, hoping that he just might turn himself around and become responsible and mature as he struggles with his mortality. What we do see throughout the movie is Ben making mistake after mistake which costs himself his pampered lifestyle and respect in the car dealership industry (even though he made it with some shady deals); his marriage and other relationships with family including his daughter Susan and his grandson. His fall from being ""like a lion"" to practically living like a pauper is well portrayed in this film.I don't know why anyone could have billed this as a comedy. It's got a script that is almost completely lacking in jokes or witty lines; and the actors don't portray their characters in a humorous way, either. While the acting is excellent the script is not that great; and sadly these fine cast members just can't rescue this film from this unpleasant problem. On the other hand, however, we get excellent performances from supporting cast members Danny DeVito as Jimmy Merino, a man Ben Kalman went to school with decades ago; and Susan Sarandon does her usual best as Ben's former wife Nancy. Look also for Jesse Eisenberg to do a great job of playing Daniel Cheston, a college junior; Mary-Louise Parker plays Ben's girlfriend Jordan Karsch to perfection and Iomgen Poots does an excellent job as Jordan's daughter Allyson.When the film begins, Ben Kalman goes to the doctor for a routine annual physical when he is roughly 60 years old; and the doctor shocks him with the news that his heart could be a problem for him. Flash forward six years: Ben is now divorced from Nancy; he is having an affair with affluent Jordan Karsch so that her very wealthy father can get him a badly needed car dealership (Ben was a business titan in the car dealership industry before he undid himself) and Ben also beds just about any young woman to make himself feel alive and forget about his mortality and his mysterious heart ailment (he never went for his heart test). Ben makes a series of terrible decisions and careless mistakes, including the time he woos Jordan's daughter Allyson into bed with him! When Allyson drops this bombshell on her mother (who is still Ben's girlfriend), let's just say things don't get pretty. It isn't long before Jordan is on Ben's back in a huge way, insisting that he give up his meager job at Jimmy Merino's diner near the college campus so that she can be sure Ben won't sleep with her daughter Allyson ever again.Of course I could tell you much more but that would be giving too much away and spoiling it for you. It may seem as if I've already given away too much but I assure you I haven't.In addition, the DVD comes with a featurette entitled ""Solitary Man: Alone in a Crowd."" There is the theatrical trailer and an optional audio commentary with writer/director Brian Koppelman, director David Levien and actor Douglas McGrath who plays the Dean of the college Allyson wants to attend.Overall, Solitary Man paints a portrait of a rather selfish--and self-destructive--man who gradually loses everything he has when he can't cope with the news that his heart may need medical attention. He can't deal with or accept his mortality and he spirals out of control even though he thinks he's completely in control.

After all, there were some, who I consider A-List actors.....Susan Sarandon (Bull Durham, Thelma & Louise, Stepmom), Michael Douglas (Wall Street, A perfect Murder, Romancing the Stone), Danny Devito (Sunny in Philadelphia, Throw Mama for a Train), Mary Louise Parker (Fried Greed Tomatoes, Boys on the Side), and the promise of a decent plot presented with a touch of humor and a little something else (can't think of the word...but a secret ingredient), that would make an almost 2 hour movie fly by in what seemed like minutes. I thought , from the description that it would be a thought provoking dark comedy kind of like ""As good as it Gets"", ""It's complicated"" or ""Something's Gotta Give""....but it wasn't. What ever those movies have in common, with the exception of Good Old Jack, was what Solitary Man was missing. I expected a movie the chronicled the rise and fall of a solitary man, but also his rebirth into something greater. After all, isn't that what watching a movie should do, give you hope? I guess I expected to find some redeeming quality that endeared me to this character, but there wasn't one. I didn't like him and really didn't care what happened to him. Instead, I got a movie that in the end I found myself confused and had to rewind to see if I missed something and ultimately muttered ""is this what I spent 2 hours of my Sunday watching"".Ok, maybe I am being a little harsh, so I will give you a brief synopsis of what the movie was about. Ben (Michael Douglas) was a car dealership owner/mogul who finds himself trying to rebuild his career (hence his life) after making some poor/bad decisions, of which he hasn't stopped making (like sleeping with his girlfriend's college bound daughter, who he takes to the college where the library is named after him). Of course, there is some foreshadowing of ""something"" that caused this change in his character, but it is was not clear after a few short clips of some meaningless dialogue between Ben and  his doctor. Now borrowing money from his disillusioned daughter, waiting or hoping for his big break (back into the business), and juggling his failing relationships with his family (his daughter is becoming disillusioned about her father), he returns to his friend (Danny Devito) in hopes of ""finding what he has lost"". And in the end, after coming to no real ""realization"" about his role in his undoing (although he never really sees himself as the victim), you realize that all the mistakes that he has made in his life was because he fears death....well, maybe I am making these revelations sound clearer than they were....it came off more like we realize his fear is that he doesn't want to know and isn't willing to face his own mortality. Ok, I may have completely misinterpreted the movie, but it was extremely disappointing. While there was stuff that could have made this story redeeming, there was really nothing to give me some kind of hope. Maybe I was just looking for more, but if you were to ask me, I wouldn't recommend this movie.

This eventually leads him to leave his wife whom it is hinted that he has been together with for many years. As Douglas' character explains his getting away with the cheating spurs him on to cheat at his job as well. He becomes involved in some fraudulent scheme of which the details are vague, but not central to the story. For it is clear that this is a man who has been on top of his profession, but has had a great fall and now is trying to find a way back to the top while at the same time dealing with the realization that young women are no longer seeing him as the ""lion"" he used to be, but rather a sad, aging man.The seemingly one thing he has going for him is his current 40'ish year old girlfriend who is a well-connected woman due to her previous marriage. Michael's character is set to rebound from his prior epic business fail, but he makes a fateful decision with his girlfriend's young and pretty 18-year old daughter that axes any final chance at professional success for himself.At this point in the story Michael is seemingly alone and at rock bottom. Yet he still finds that he has  a friend and an ex-wife that still loves him and wants him back. The movie concludes with Michael needing to make a decision of whether to return to his ex-wife who is waiting for him in the car or to follow the next pretty young skirt that walks by as he is sitting on a bench on the campus of his alma matter. The viewer is left to decide which course of action Michael has chosen.I'm being a little generous with the 5-star review but only because this is a film that I had no expectations of and was pleasantly surprised to the point that I watched it a 2nd time. Despite making some bad choices Michael's character is very likable and easy to identify with. When you have had success like Michael's character did for so long, you start to think it will go on forever. That you will always be a ""lion"" as he says. But one day you wake up and realize your an old man and no longer a lion and especially due to his professional failures he finds himself left with nothing.

This is not ""An Unmarried Woman"", or ""Fatal Attraction"" or ""Kramer vs Kramer"" or ""Fanny and Alexander"".... This is Michael Douglas playing a guy going through the ropes of showing us what an inveterate, self-serving yutz his character is!

WOW! But we don't get a good sense of any remorse on HIS part...and nobody really seems to be especially disgusted with him, either, except the older girlfriend and his own daughter!

He then goes on a downward cycle of affairs and self-destructive behavior. Even as his wealth and power disappear, he retains his charm, which he uses to great effect--but only for so long. Eventually, he severs nearly all the ties to those who love him and ends up adrift, though he himself has a hard time admitting this fact.Douglas's performance is spot-on in a role that clearly was written with him in mind. The supporting cast is stellar. The dialog is generally solid, and the film is intelligent.

Could be, there are similarities of the behaviors from what I have read. However, Michael Douglas made this man, Ben Kalman come to life. No doubt, no question.Ben Kalman has always been the man in the middle of the room, that everyone stared at. The man everyone wanted to know. As a car dealer, he built a business that was the best in New York State. He appeared on the covers of all the right magazines and all the right television shows. Until that day when a physician told him he had something not quite right on his electrocardiogram. He had already started to feel invisible. I think he meant that all the attention was no longer on him. So, he became a real lady's man, bedding whatever female he met. This led to a divorce from the only woman, he ever really loved, Nancy, played by Susan Sarandon. And, he became an absent father to his daughter, Susan, played by Jenna Fischer. But, of course, daughters forgive and she is in and out of his life. Ben has an affair with a rich woman, Mary-Louise Parker. Her father has strings and can open avenues for a new car dealership. Her daughter, wants to go to the same college Ben did in Boston and Ben brings her there to talk with the Dean and smooth things out. As things fall apart, so does Ben. But, as always, he thinks he can charm his way out of anything. In the end, Ben has to make decisions, and does he make the right ones?A film of a man who is alone, lonely, fills his life with younger woman, wine and song. He forgets what matters in life, and even though his best friend, Danny Devito, tells him like it is, Ben doesn't see. Michael Douglas plays Ben as the man everyone wants to be, the man who would beg for rent money from his daughter, and finally as the man who needs to face himself. Probably one of Michael Douglas's best performances. He was a contender!Highly Recommended. prisrob 09-23-10",4,I'll Be What I Am,1285200000,"09 23, 2010",2010,2108,"['34', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'will', 'can', 'find', 'meA', 'girl', 'who', ""'ll"", 'stay', 'wo', ""n't"", 'play', 'games', 'meI', ""'ll"", 'be', 'what', 'amA', 'solitary', 'manA', 'solitary', 'man', '34', 'Neil', 'DiamondIt', 'been', 'said', 'role', 'Ben', 'Kalman', 'was', 'made', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Could', 'be', 'are', 'similarities', 'behaviors', 'what', 'have', 'read', 'However', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'made', 'man', 'Ben', 'Kalman', 'come', 'life', 'doubt', 'question.Ben', 'Kalman', 'always', 'been', 'man', 'middle', 'room', 'everyone', 'stared', 'man', 'everyone', 'wanted', 'know', 'car', 'dealer', 'built', 'business', 'was', 'best', 'New', 'York', 'State', 'appeared', 'covers', 'right', 'magazines', 'right', 'television', 'shows', 'day', 'when', 'physician', 'told', 'had', 'something', 'not', 'quite', 'right', 'electrocardiogram', 'had', 'already', 'started', 'feel', 'invisible', 'think', 'meant', 'attention', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'So', 'became', 'real', 'lady', 'man', 'bedding', 'female', 'met', 'led', 'divorce', 'only', 'woman', 'ever', 'really', 'loved', 'Nancy', 'played', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'became', 'absent', 'father', 'daughter', 'Susan', 'played', 'Jenna', 'Fischer', 'course', 'daughters', 'forgive', 'life', 'Ben', 'affair', 'rich', 'woman', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'father', 'strings', 'can', 'open', 'avenues', 'new', 'car', 'dealership', 'daughter', 'go', 'same', 'college', 'Ben', 'did', 'Boston', 'Ben', 'talk', 'Dean', 'smooth', 'things', 'out', 'things', 'fall', 'apart', 'so', 'Ben', 'always', 'can', 'charm', 'way', 'anything', 'end', 'Ben', 'make', 'decisions', 'make', 'right', 'ones', 'film', 'man', 'who', 'alone', 'lonely', 'life', 'younger', 'woman', 'wine', 'song', 'what', 'matters', 'life', 'even', 'best', 'friend', 'Danny', 'Devito', 'Ben', ""n't"", 'see', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Ben', 'man', 'everyone', 'be', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'beg', 'rent', 'money', 'daughter', 'finally', 'man', 'who', 'face', 'Probably', 'one', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'best', 'performances', 'was', 'contender', 'Highly', 'Recommended', 'prisrob', '09-23-10']",N/A

Michael Douglas plays a man who seems to have everything in order. Hes intelligent, and very successful, and perhaps filled with a little too much self esteem for his own good at times which becomes his downfall. But after a doctor orders some tests for his heart he loses control of who he is and makes a lot of bad choices in his life that ultimately causes him utter ruin. In trying to escape the possible reality of his own mortality he becomes a very destructive individual, but not in the way most characters who are destructive in film have been known to become. In his case his own perception of wrong doing seems rather innocent, and the film sort of steers his mistakes in such a way that the audience almost agrees with his poor choices. But that is the beauty of this film. It shows us how easily seemingly moderate mistakes can lead to terrible consequences. Douglas fits perfectly into this role. Though he looses everything hes never moved to explode into anger like someone like Gordon Gekko would react. His calmness and sense of sincerity causes the audience to empathize with him. Once his destruction becomes apparent, it forces us to consider just how easily we our selves can make choices that dont seem too bad over all, but can in the end- destroy us.

Unlike other reviewers ,  and I am a fan of Douglas, I  don't see this as a huge stretch from many of his other parts. As a fan who has enjoyed Douglas since the days ofThe Streets of San Francisco - Season One, Vol. 1I am over 50 and was hoping that there would be something I could identify with in this story but as the amazon.com reviewer properly noted his ability to score with 20 something women is beyond ridiculous and that alone is enough to ruin the believability or relate-ability of the story. That portion of the movie/story is so creepy that it ruins what could have been a very good story of growing old and the challenges that we all face.I think there is a really good movie in there....I know there is, but I think toning down the swordsman aspect would have been a good idea...and maybe casting someone else.  Douglas was much better in the far superiorWonder Boysor evenKing of California.  I can't help but thinking back to a much more enjoyable movie called Middle Aged Crazy with Bruce Dern and Ann-Margret I  saw as a young man and wish was on DVD.I just can't truly recommend this movie to anybody unless they are a huge fan of Michael Douglas and are a collector that has to have all his films.

Michael Douglas plays a 60 year old washed up car dealer, womanizer, horrible father, and all around despicable person named Ben Kalmen.I'm trying to think about the plot so I can write a synopsis, but I'm having a difficult time because there really wasn't one.  The viewer gets to watch Ben as he lives his life with only one priority: pleasing himself.He enters into a relationship with a woman solely because of her wealth and connections.  This woman asks him to take her 18 year old daughter to her college interview (presumably because it is his alma mater and he knows the dean).  While away, he sleeps with the girl that is 42 years his junior.  He shows no remorse whatsoever, and even tries to ""reconnect"" with the girl once they are home (she turns him down).He constantly lets his daughter down: repeatedly asking her for money, disrespecting her husband, telling her about his tryst with an 18 year old and how it was ""so worth it,"" missing his grandson's birthday party, and having a one night stand with his daugther's friend.  Father of the Year material...The movie tries to offer up justification for his awful behavior but I thought the ""explanation"" was completely lame.  It didn't make me feel a bit sorry for him, nor did it in any way excuse his actions.I was amazed at how many talented actors were in this movie.  And I can't help thinking all that talent was wasted on a horrible script.As far as content goes, there's profanity and sexual content.  The language isn't pervasive as it is in some R rated movies, but there's still some (the main character uses the f word often).  The sexual content isn't extremely graphic, but the scene where he sleeps with the 18 year old is disturbing regardless.  There's a small amount of violence- in a scene where Ben gets beat up.  I have to say, he deserved every punch.  Yes, that is how much I disliked his character.Conclusion:  If you are looking for an interesting movie with a main character that is even remotely likeable, skip this one.

Douglas plays a heart patient who is in extreme denial of his condition.  He was so shocked and scared by the revelation that he had aged to the point of having health issues, he refuses to live like a senior citizen.  Getting into fights with men young enough to be his grandchildren, and of course bedding as many young ladies as possible have become regular activities.  It destroyed his marriage, his career, and nearly his relationship with his adult daughter.This isn't a feel good movie.  There are no easy resolutions in ""Solitary Man,"" just the agonizing sight of a man slowly self-destructing.  There are a bunch of good performances in the supporting cast.  Danny DeVito is actually a bit underused as an old friend of Douglas' character.  Susan Sarandon is the ex-wife.  Jesse Eisenberg, the hot young star of ""The Social Network,"" is a college student who idolizes the Douglas character.  Jenna Fischer of ""The Office"" turns in solid work as Douglas' daughter.This is a sometimes funny, but mostly just sad movie.  Not in a tear-jerker kind of way.  Not in a way that goes for an easy emotional reaction.  Its a slow build as we learn more and more about what makes this guy tick, and why he is so solitary in life.

1357166,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B003Q6D21Y,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[2, 3]","I have been a fan of Michael Douglas' for a very long time.  I feel that his presence in a movie can truly alter the outcome of a film.  In the past few years, Douglas hasn't really made a movie that has critical acclaim.  I am basing this statement on ""hype"", award nominations, ticket sales or word of mouth.  This doesn't mean that he has been making bad movies.  The movies just appear, at least to me, not as grandiose as they once were.This leads me to ""Solitary Man"", a film that was made in 2009 that is a return to form for Michael Douglas as a film that should receive every ounce of all the factors I have previously noted.  While I watched this movie I was again reminded why I love Michael Douglas.I am not going to spend much time with plot details, because I believe the movie speaks for itself.  Nevertheless, Ben Kalman (Douglas) was once a very successful car dealer, but due to some bad business choices, infidelity in his marriage and an evasive heart condition he has lost it all.Now it seems like Ben is swimming upstream in order to become the person he once was.  However, his sexual urges seem to be his major downfall.  Despite his sexual appetite that ended his marriage, he is still civil with his ex-wife (Susan Sarandon).  It appears that Ben has an opportunity to get back into the car business via his current girlfriend (Mary-Louise Parker) all he has to do is take her daughter (Imogen Poots) to a college interview.The rest of the film is basically the trials and tribulations of Ben Kalman.  It is extremely interesting to see the cause and effect of the decisions this character makes.  After about ten minutes, I honestly felt like I wasn't even watching Michael Douglas anymore.  The acting in this movie is amazing.  The plot is both complex and simple, which allows for the performances to shine.The supporting cast is amazing; Danny DeVito and Susan Sarandon both have small parts but they are wonderful.  Mary-Louise Parker, Jenna Fischer and Jesse Eisenberg are solid.  I was also very impressed with Imogen Poots, it wasn't until I watched the ""Making of Feature"" that I realized she is English.  Her American accent is impeccable.This is a movie about redemption, falling from grace, trepidation and hope.  It is also a film that leaves much to interpretation, which I really like.  While some movie goers might be put off by this, I found it refreshing; especially with some of the drivel that embellishes the theater and TV screens.As of recent Michael Douglas has had his battle with throat cancer, it appears that he is doing well and is ""out of the woods"".  I have a feeling he might be nominated for an Academy Award for either this movie or ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps"".  Now I haven't seen ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps"" (although I want to) but I can say with no reservations that Douglas deserves an Academy Award nomination for his performance in this movie.  Not as a token, but because he was (and is) and amazing actor and a cinematic legend.",5,A Michael Douglas gem not to be missed.,1292976000,"12 22, 2010",2010,3010,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'feel', 'presence', 'movie', 'can', 'truly', 'alter', 'outcome', 'film', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'Douglas', ""n't"", 'really', 'made', 'movie', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'am', 'basing', 'statement', 'hype', 'award', 'nominations', 'ticket', 'sales', 'word', 'mouth', ""n't"", 'mean', 'been', 'making', 'bad', 'movies', 'movies', 'just', 'appear', 'least', 'not', 'as', 'grandiose', 'once', 'were.This', 'Solitary', 'Man', 'film', 'was', 'made', '2009', 'return', 'form', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'film', 'should', 'receive', 'ounce', 'factors', 'have', 'previously', 'noted', 'watched', 'movie', 'was', 'again', 'reminded', 'why', 'love', 'Michael', 'Douglas.I', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'plot', 'details', 'believe', 'movie', 'speaks', 'Nevertheless', 'Ben', 'Kalman', 'Douglas', 'was', 'once', 'very', 'successful', 'car', 'dealer', 'due', 'bad', 'business', 'choices', 'infidelity', 'marriage', 'evasive', 'heart', 'condition', 'lost', 'Ben', 'swimming', 'upstream', 'order', 'become', 'person', 'once', 'was', 'However', 'sexual', 'urges', 'seem', 'be', 'major', 'downfall', 'sexual', 'appetite', 'ended', 'marriage', 'still', 'civil', 'ex-wife', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Ben', 'opportunity', 'get', 'back', 'car', 'business', 'current', 'girlfriend', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'do', 'take', 'daughter', 'Imogen', 'Poots', 'college', 'interview.The', 'rest', 'film', 'basically', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'Ben', 'Kalman', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'see', 'cause', 'effect', 'decisions', 'character', 'ten', 'minutes', 'honestly', 'felt', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'watching', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'anymore', 'acting', 'movie', 'amazing', 'plot', 'complex', 'simple', 'performances', 'shine.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'amazing', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'have', 'small', 'parts', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'Jenna', 'Fischer', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'are', 'solid', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'impressed', 'Imogen', 'Poots', 'was', ""n't"", 'watched', 'Making', 'Feature', 'realized', 'English', 'American', 'accent', 'impeccable.This', 'movie', 'redemption', 'falling', 'grace', 'trepidation', 'hope', 'also', 'film', 'much', 'interpretation', 'really', 'movie', 'goers', 'might', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'found', 'refreshing', 'especially', 'drivel', 'theater', 'TV', 'screens.As', 'recent', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'had', 'battle', 'throat', 'cancer', 'doing', 'well', 'woods', 'have', 'feeling', 'might', 'be', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'movie', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Money', 'Never', 'Sleeps', 'Now', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Money', 'Never', 'Sleeps', 'want', 'can', 'say', 'reservations', 'Douglas', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'performance', 'movie', 'Not', 'token', 'was', 'amazing', 'actor', 'cinematic', 'legend']",N/A

When Ben is asked to accompany Parker's daughter to his alma mater (for an interview), things spiral out of control, and Ben finds that his prospects have turned very bleak.This is a story about a despicable character, one which elicits no sympathy (at least not from me), and it was difficult to watch this 60 something year old man bed one young woman after another (though the sex scenes were quite tastefully done and there was nothing explicit or overly salacious, phew!). Initially, I was wondering, ""What is the point of this movie? There are people like this, we get it."" It was only halfway through that I began to see this movie in a clearer right. It is a compelling character study of a self-destructive character who is battling sex addiction, but refuses to do anything about it. His daughter enables his behavior by lending a sympathetic ear and even giving him financial aid when he is broke and desperate, though even she balks at helping him much later, realizing that he is truly past redemption.  Sarandon plays the friendly and sympathetic ex-wife who helps him out, having got her life on track after their divorce. There's Danny Devito who plays the role of a supportive old friend. The acting is well-done on all fronts and that helps elevate this movie above average.Those who don't care for movies where the main character is an emotionally out of whack, self-destructive character might want to steer clear of this one, especially given that the central character is an aging Lothario who hankers after young girls decades younger than him. Those who appreciate compelling character studies might get something out of this, as I did.",4,"Compelling character study, but makes for quite a painful watch",1286409600,"10 7, 2010",2010,2596,"['confess', 'took', 'while', 'get', 'movie', 'fact', 'first', 'hour', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'husband', 'had', 'convince', 'continue', 'watching', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'done', 'fair', 'share', 'sleazy', 'roles', 'portrayal', 'aging', 'playboy', 'Ben', 'Kalmen', 'penchant', 'young', 'girls', 'one', 'career', 'best', 'performances.At', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Ben', 'top', 'game', 'annual', 'physical', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'cross', 'off', 'list', 'things', 'do', 'then', 'startling', 'news', 'health', 'viewers', 'six', 'years', 'future', 'Ben', 'now', 'divorced', 'character', 'played', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'financially', 'diminished', 'yet', 'have', 'retained', 'affections', 'loyalty', 'married', 'daughter', 'played', 'Jenna', 'Fischer', 'ex-wife', 'also', 'involved', 'relationship', 'wealthy', 'woman', 'played', 'Mary', 'Louise', 'Parker', 'who', '19-year-old', 'daughter', 'When', 'Ben', 'asked', 'accompany', 'Parker', 'daughter', 'alma', 'mater', 'interview', 'things', 'spiral', 'control', 'Ben', 'prospects', 'have', 'turned', 'very', 'bleak.This', 'story', 'despicable', 'character', 'one', 'sympathy', 'least', 'not', 'was', 'difficult', 'watch', '60', 'something', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'bed', 'one', 'young', 'woman', 'sex', 'scenes', 'were', 'quite', 'tastefully', 'done', 'was', 'nothing', 'explicit', 'overly', 'salacious', 'phew', 'Initially', 'was', 'wondering', 'What', 'point', 'movie', 'are', 'people', 'get', 'was', 'only', 'halfway', 'began', 'see', 'movie', 'clearer', 'right', 'compelling', 'character', 'study', 'self-destructive', 'character', 'who', 'battling', 'sex', 'addiction', 'do', 'anything', 'daughter', 'behavior', 'lending', 'sympathetic', 'ear', 'even', 'giving', 'financial', 'aid', 'when', 'broke', 'desperate', 'though', 'even', 'helping', 'much', 'later', 'realizing', 'truly', 'past', 'redemption', 'Sarandon', 'friendly', 'sympathetic', 'ex-wife', 'who', 'out', 'having', 'got', 'life', 'track', 'divorce', 'Danny', 'Devito', 'who', 'role', 'supportive', 'old', 'friend', 'acting', 'well-done', 'fronts', 'elevate', 'movie', 'average.Those', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'movies', 'where', 'main', 'character', 'emotionally', 'whack', 'self-destructive', 'character', 'might', 'want', 'steer', 'clear', 'one', 'especially', 'given', 'central', 'character', 'aging', 'Lothario', 'who', 'young', 'girls', 'decades', 'younger', 'who', 'appreciate', 'compelling', 'character', 'studies', 'might', 'get', 'something', 'did']",N/A
