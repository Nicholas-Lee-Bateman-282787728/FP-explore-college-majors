1459259,A1LET625A2VX41,B005FQ2HEQ,"A. Lynn Bowman ""muzikluvrrr""","[1, 1]","One thing about the Angel Series is that it is different.  I wanted to buy ""Avenging Angel"" for years, I don't know why I wanted it, but there it was on my wish list and it was always too expensive? Then IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT released the Angel Trilogy on a single disc.  There aren't alot of extras, just the original previews and the movies.  What I will say is that these are pretty good quality for what they are.  IE managed to clean up the films so there are no streaks or skips like many old movies copied from VHS tapes, these are the real deal and were good to watch.  There are three different actresses playing Angel but they look enough alike to not be a distraction.  If you like the old ""B"" Movies this is a great set for the price and there is some fun watching some of these crazy characatures.",4,"Well Angel, You've Changed",1346371200,"08 31, 2012",2012,808,"['One', 'thing', 'Angel', 'Series', 'different', 'wanted', 'buy', 'Avenging', 'Angel', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'wanted', 'was', 'wish', 'list', 'was', 'always', 'too', 'expensive', 'Then', 'IMAGE', 'ENTERTAINMENT', 'released', 'Angel', 'Trilogy', 'single', 'disc', 'are', ""n't"", 'alot', 'extras', 'just', 'original', 'previews', 'movies', 'What', 'will', 'say', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'quality', 'what', 'are', 'IE', 'managed', 'clean', 'up', 'films', 'are', 'streaks', 'skips', 'many', 'old', 'movies', 'copied', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'are', 'real', 'deal', 'were', 'good', 'watch', 'are', 'three', 'different', 'actresses', 'playing', 'Angel', 'look', 'enough', 'alike', 'not', 'be', 'distraction', 'like', 'old', 'B', 'Movies', 'great', 'set', 'price', 'fun', 'watching', 'crazy', 'characatures']",N/A

1459261,A13JPNQI7WEQ7C,B005FQ2HEQ,A. Snyder,"[28, 31]","Years ago I owned the original Anchor Bay release of ""The Angel Collection"" but being a broke college student I had to sell the thing as I was strapped for cash. Oh, those were sad days. Since that time I wanted to rebuy the set but it went out-of-print and was selling for ridiculous amounts of money so I decided to wait and low and behold Image Entertainment reissued the films in their own triple feature set... but it's not as good the old Anchor Bay counterpart.Unlike the Anchor Bay set which has each Angel film on a separate disc, the Image set has all three on one single sided, duel layer disc. When I purchased the set I assumed it would be a double disc set and was rather disappointed to see all three films crammed together on one disc. To my surprise however the films' picture quality doesn't suffer too much with having all three films compressed onto one disc and the digital flacks common with compressed films was kept to a minimum and didn't bother my enjoyment of the films at all.Overall I would have preferred this release to be a 2 disc set much in the vein of the Shout! Factory Roger Corman triple features but for the price the picture quality of these films wasn't bad. If you are a die hard fan of the films then you might want to hunt down the original Anchor Bay release as it is of higher quality but for casual fans this set will do just fine.On a side note after all these years I still hear people complain that the set doesn't contain the fourth film ""Angel 4: Undercover"". The reason for this is because the rights to that film are owned by Lionsgate Entertainment. Knowing their track record for older films it will be a miracle if it ever gets released. Still keeping my fingers crossed...",4,"Not as good as the old Anchor Bay release, but this will do just fine",1334707200,"04 18, 2012",2012,1730,"['Years', 'ago', 'owned', 'original', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'release', 'Angel', 'Collection', 'being', 'broke', 'college', 'student', 'had', 'sell', 'thing', 'was', 'strapped', 'cash', 'Oh', 'were', 'sad', 'days', 'time', 'wanted', 'rebuy', 'set', 'went', 'out-of-print', 'was', 'selling', 'ridiculous', 'amounts', 'money', 'decided', 'wait', 'low', 'behold', 'Image', 'Entertainment', 'reissued', 'films', 'own', 'triple', 'feature', 'set', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'old', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'set', 'Angel', 'film', 'separate', 'disc', 'Image', 'set', 'three', 'one', 'single', 'sided', 'duel', 'layer', 'disc', 'When', 'purchased', 'set', 'assumed', 'would', 'be', 'double', 'disc', 'set', 'was', 'rather', 'disappointed', 'see', 'three', 'films', 'crammed', 'together', 'one', 'disc', 'surprise', 'however', 'films', 'picture', 'quality', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'too', 'much', 'having', 'three', 'films', 'compressed', 'one', 'disc', 'digital', 'flacks', 'common', 'compressed', 'films', 'was', 'kept', 'minimum', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'enjoyment', 'films', 'all.Overall', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'release', 'be', '2', 'disc', 'set', 'much', 'vein', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'triple', 'features', 'price', 'picture', 'quality', 'films', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'are', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'films', 'then', 'might', 'want', 'hunt', 'down', 'original', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'release', 'higher', 'quality', 'casual', 'fans', 'set', 'will', 'do', 'just', 'fine.On', 'side', 'note', 'years', 'still', 'hear', 'people', 'complain', 'set', ""n't"", 'contain', 'fourth', 'film', 'Angel', '4', 'Undercover', 'reason', 'rights', 'film', 'are', 'owned', 'Lionsgate', 'Entertainment', 'Knowing', 'track', 'record', 'older', 'films', 'will', 'be', 'miracle', 'ever', 'released', 'Still', 'keeping', 'fingers', 'crossed']",N/A
