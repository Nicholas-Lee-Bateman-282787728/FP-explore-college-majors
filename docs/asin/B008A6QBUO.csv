1549280,A3LFHTJ7JPXJ28,B008A6QBUO,"amnightus ""amnightus""","[3, 6]","I can tell this project has a lot of heart and soul into it.  Unfortunately, it is just lacking in Execution and the Writing/Script is riddled with holes and has problems in the way of flow, cohesion, and movement.The script feels like it was written by someone who doesn't quite know the industry or how to write real dialogue and scenes or has no real clue about the world of finance.I was more or less fine with the direction and cinematography and feel that if the actors had a good script they could have made a decent film. But the overall story just tried to do too much in too short of time frame without real conflict and focus.  There is nothing in the way of ""set up"" everything is just sorta thrown together and the arch is just too broad to be effective.I mean, we start from childhood, then adolesence, college, graduation, quick stint at a job, getting promoted, starting a company on the side, losing the company, losing the job, getting offers overseas, doing an illegal job...ugg, its like a mile wide and an inch deep instead of being something smaller and deeper and more engaging...This movie could have really benefited from watching the Movie ""Hustle and Flow"" and ""Boiler Room"".Hustle and Flow was a great movie because of laser like focus and incredible writing.  Same with Boiler Room, that movie is probably a better guide for what this movie could/should have strived to achieve.In any event.  I can tell this movie was made by people who cared and wanted to make a good movie, unfortunately, that isn't enough to overcome a bad script and bad writing.",2,"A for Effort, D for Execution and Writing",1346716800,"09 4, 2012",2012,1580,"['can', 'tell', 'project', 'lot', 'heart', 'soul', 'Unfortunately', 'just', 'lacking', 'Execution', 'Writing/Script', 'riddled', 'holes', 'problems', 'way', 'flow', 'cohesion', 'movement.The', 'script', 'feels', 'was', 'written', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'industry', 'how', 'write', 'real', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'real', 'clue', 'world', 'finance.I', 'was', 'more', 'less', 'fine', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'feel', 'actors', 'had', 'good', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'decent', 'film', 'overall', 'story', 'just', 'tried', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'short', 'time', 'frame', 'real', 'conflict', 'focus', 'nothing', 'way', 'set', 'up', 'everything', 'just', 'sorta', 'thrown', 'together', 'arch', 'just', 'too', 'broad', 'be', 'effective.I', 'mean', 'start', 'childhood', 'then', 'adolesence', 'college', 'graduation', 'quick', 'stint', 'job', 'getting', 'promoted', 'starting', 'company', 'side', 'losing', 'company', 'losing', 'job', 'getting', 'offers', 'overseas', 'doing', 'illegal', 'job', 'ugg', 'mile', 'wide', 'inch', 'deep', 'instead', 'being', 'something', 'smaller', 'deeper', 'more', 'engaging', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'benefited', 'watching', 'Movie', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'Boiler', 'Room', '.Hustle', 'Flow', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'laser', 'focus', 'incredible', 'writing', 'Same', 'Boiler', 'Room', 'movie', 'probably', 'better', 'guide', 'what', 'movie', 'could/should', 'have', 'strived', 'achieve.In', 'event', 'can', 'tell', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'people', 'who', 'cared', 'wanted', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'enough', 'overcome', 'bad', 'script', 'bad', 'writing']",N/A

1549283,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B008A6QBUO,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","This story is in two parts. The first part deals with a poorly developed friendship between Darell (Sean Riggs) the smart kid and drug dealing Dre (Dennis L.A. White). This loosely sets up the second half where Darrell obtains his business degree and gets involved in some bad investments using the drug money. For some reason because it was his money, he is being investigated because his hedge fund investor (Brandon Ruckdashel) lost it. Clearly the author never worked in investing.The setting is in Philadelphia with broken dirty streets. The film likes to use and quote Machiavelli, although I found the usage to be pseudo-intellectual as if to say, &#34;Hey! Look at me! I read a book!&#34; The acting was especially sad. What was with giving Tony Todd two different roles, one as disfigured pimp and another as an FBI agent? Didn't Ed Wood think we would notice? The plot had continuity issues especially at the end.The film tries to go deep, but doesn't achieve. Rel Dowdell has done and can do better. Not worth renting. Amateur attempt at acting intellectual.Parental Guide: F-bomb, N-word, brief sex, side breast nudity.",2,FLAWED FILM NOT WORTH WATCHING,1370131200,"06 2, 2013",2013,1131,"['story', 'two', 'parts', 'first', 'part', 'deals', 'poorly', 'developed', 'friendship', 'Darell', 'Sean', 'Riggs', 'smart', 'kid', 'drug', 'dealing', 'Dre', 'Dennis', 'L.A.', 'White', 'loosely', 'up', 'second', 'half', 'where', 'Darrell', 'business', 'degree', 'involved', 'bad', 'investments', 'using', 'drug', 'money', 'reason', 'was', 'money', 'being', 'investigated', 'hedge', 'fund', 'investor', 'Brandon', 'Ruckdashel', 'lost', 'Clearly', 'author', 'never', 'worked', 'investing.The', 'setting', 'Philadelphia', 'broken', 'dirty', 'streets', 'film', 'likes', 'use', 'quote', 'Machiavelli', 'found', 'usage', 'be', 'pseudo-intellectual', 'say', '34', 'Hey', 'Look', 'read', 'book', '34', 'acting', 'was', 'especially', 'sad', 'What', 'was', 'giving', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'two', 'different', 'roles', 'one', 'disfigured', 'pimp', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Did', ""n't"", 'Ed', 'Wood', 'think', 'would', 'notice', 'plot', 'had', 'continuity', 'issues', 'especially', 'end.The', 'film', 'tries', 'go', 'deep', ""n't"", 'achieve', 'Rel', 'Dowdell', 'done', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'Not', 'worth', 'renting', 'Amateur', 'attempt', 'acting', 'intellectual.Parental', 'Guide', 'F-bomb', 'N-word', 'brief', 'sex', 'side', 'breast', 'nudity']",N/A
