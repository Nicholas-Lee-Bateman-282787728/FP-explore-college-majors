1198244,A3V1ARVPHYOZJS,B001GNG2YI,"D. S. Wymore ""Golden Age of Hollywood fan""","[49, 50]","I bought this DVD because I LOVE the television program Peter Gunn. I've been searching for more episodes other than the ones on the two volume box sets released by A&E a few years ago. Amazon did not list what was on this DVD but it was pretty reasonably priced so I bought it in hopes of two never released episodes. No such luck - this DVD contains very poor quality prints of 2 Peter Gunn episodes (Let's Kill Timothy and The Fuse- both of which are on the A&E sets), 1 Burke's Law (Who Killed Jason Shaw?) and 2 Richard Diamond episodes (Picture of Fear and The Merry Go Round Case). The famous Peter Gunn theme music has been replaced by some cheesy music (probably a copyright issue) and the Burke's Law is such poor quality it's hard to watch. The 2 Richard Diamond episodes have some old commercials for Maxwell House Coffee included. The DVD case itself has an awful petroleum smell that about knocks you out when you open it.

Just remember it is in black & white and from the early days of television so quality of today isn't' there.
