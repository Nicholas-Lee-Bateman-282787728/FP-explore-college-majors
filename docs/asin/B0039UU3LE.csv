I was very excited to find this movie and was even more excited that it arrived in such a timely manner. I was pleased that the quality of the picture was just as good as I remembered it to be the first time I saw it on TV years ago. I plan to visit this seller again for more movies that I would like to add to my library.,5,Winter Kill,1330214400,"02 26, 2012",2012,382,"['one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'was', 'hard', 'find', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'find', 'movie', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'excited', 'arrived', 'such', 'timely', 'manner', 'was', 'pleased', 'quality', 'picture', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'remembered', 'be', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'TV', 'years', 'ago', 'plan', 'visit', 'seller', 'again', 'more', 'movies', 'would', 'like', 'add', 'library']",The Winter Kill
1334289,A2FNE3CGLVMHB3,B0039UU3LE,"Brooke ""islandr1""","[0, 0]","I have seen this on cable channels and remembered it as a really good mystery with an unusual plot.  The snowy scenery of a mountain community is beautiful, and it adds to the interesting plot and good acting of the characters, many of  whom will be remembered. I believe it may have been Nick Nolte's first film...or among the first.I don't need to give away the plot; it isn't necessary. The movie is watchable more than once, and it doesn't lose interest even if you remember who the villain is. It's Andy at his best as the sheriff of an isolated mountain town with a killer with a reason for his acts that isn't a common one.With good characters, a good plot, and an interesting twist to murders, it's a good movie for an evening's entertainment.",4,A Good Mystery Plot with Andy Griffith as Sheriff Detective,1376006400,"08 9, 2013",2013,751,"['have', 'seen', 'cable', 'channels', 'remembered', 'really', 'good', 'mystery', 'unusual', 'plot', 'snowy', 'scenery', 'mountain', 'community', 'beautiful', 'interesting', 'plot', 'good', 'acting', 'characters', 'many', 'whom', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'believe', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'first', 'film', 'first.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'give', 'away', 'plot', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'movie', 'watchable', 'more', 'once', ""n't"", 'lose', 'interest', 'even', 'remember', 'who', 'villain', 'Andy', 'best', 'sheriff', 'isolated', 'mountain', 'town', 'killer', 'reason', 'acts', ""n't"", 'common', 'one.With', 'good', 'characters', 'good', 'plot', 'interesting', 'twist', 'murders', 'good', 'movie', 'evening', 'entertainment']",The Winter Kill
1334290,A6VIFYHCJ1SCD,B0039UU3LE,B Sharp,"[0, 0]","This is an odd movie. I've got mixed feelings about it. The plot is somewhat suspenseful and there's a fairly interesting mystery, and I think Griffith does an admirable job of playing (big surprise) a small town lawman. But I found the flashback scenes and the ridiculous sound effects of the shotgun to be cumbersome and goofy. Some of the other characters were rather wooden, too. Kind of plays like a made-for-TV movie that someone tried to roughen up for a harder rating. Recommended for Griffith fans, but otherwise would probably suggest something else.",3,Mayberry this is not,1391126400,"01 31, 2014",2014,560,"['odd', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'got', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'plot', 'somewhat', 'suspenseful', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'mystery', 'think', 'Griffith', 'admirable', 'job', 'playing', 'big', 'surprise', 'small', 'town', 'lawman', 'found', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'ridiculous', 'sound', 'effects', 'shotgun', 'be', 'cumbersome', 'goofy', 'other', 'characters', 'were', 'rather', 'wooden', 'too', 'Kind', 'plays', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'someone', 'tried', 'roughen', 'up', 'harder', 'rating', 'Recommended', 'Griffith', 'fans', 'otherwise', 'would', 'probably', 'suggest', 'something', 'else']",The Winter Kill

The mood and tone is that of the recent Tom Selleck &#34;Jesse Stone&#34; movies.  I like that Andy could be serious and it worked.  There were two more movies that he made like this but they had a little more comedy to them and they were good, too, but I think they could have stayed on this path and been just a little better.There are some driving scenes that I think they used to maybe pad the film or to just show the great mountain view...

I wanted to see it since I never knew in 1974 Andy attempted to be a sheriff again in a small town but not a comedy.  I think if there would have been better actors in the movie it may have made it.
