Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson have a very awkward chemistry but it seems to work for this kind of film. Hoffman's character is on his way to London for his daughter's wedding. He later meets Thompson's character who is desperate for love but can't seem to let go of her trust issues. The two fall for each other instantly and try to make their brief encounter long-lasting. Good film but kind of slow - it's a mixed bag for me.",3,You're never too old for love.,1279756800,"07 22, 2010",2010,549,"['Last', 'Chance', 'Harvey', 'sweet', 'tender', 'film', 'two', 'lonely', 'people', 'who', 'forge', 'unlikely', 'connection', 'foreign', 'land', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'have', 'very', 'awkward', 'chemistry', 'work', 'kind', 'film', 'Hoffman', 'character', 'way', 'London', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'later', 'Thompson', 'character', 'who', 'desperate', 'love', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'let', 'go', 'trust', 'issues', 'two', 'fall', 'other', 'instantly', 'try', 'make', 'brief', 'encounter', 'long-lasting', 'Good', 'film', 'kind', 'slow', 'mixed', 'bag']",Last Chance Harvey
1150216,A3BOGELRQJK8OE,B0015OKWKS,a gentle sound,"[17, 24]","That was once an observation about my preferences in movies, that I enjoyed stories that seemed like they might happen to you, could happen, and were just about nothing really. And after spending the afternoon in Camarillo, CA in an art theater of very senior citizens in audience I think many felt it might happen too, because they gave a nice small gentle applause.Even with their canes, assistants and wheelchair gear (noted to me by my companion holding up  my poorly performing leg so I could hobble in) we were an older crew.What was the movie? Hum. The story of a man, a jazz piano commercial jingle writer, coping with a pressure sounding job nightmare in a digitizing universe, going to London to see his daughter be married. His name is Harvey Shine, that is interesting because of course he is just Dustin Hoffman reprising himself as a romantic duffer, struggling with the job, with the marriage of a daughter he's lost to a divorce long ago, as she folded into her mother's remarriage. He's put up at a hotel, away from the entire family, apart, odd wheel. It carries so well those outsider feelings of this man, that has a daughter who doesn't seem to know him too well, that he later will say in a conversation in the film she always seemed a bit embarrassed by him, as he notes he had a child within something that never was quite right. Never right. It took a toll, one he obviously regrets,it hurts,  but he knows another price had to be paid by his child who has almost become another man's child. Hard, impossible to verbalize. We miss in life on many things.  In a series of hits and misses he then at this same time runs into Emma Thompson, oops Kate Walker I think, working for the airline, struggling with her own anxieties about her own scene of awkwardly attempting meeting someone, with nervous apprehension-anxieties over this. And as it seems to happen sometimes, he rebuffs her (ironically on his plane flight he was rebuffed by a passenger not interested in his chat) turns from her and some airline survey, only later to find himself after a horrible day running back into her at the airport as he fails to get the plane and get out of there to an essential work meeting. And finding a rapport then, a shift in the mind and heart, I think he can see her now. See her. After he's lost enough to understand when he is found.Or has found. Seeing.It reminded me somehow of years ago when I was in my early twenties.Just a vague familiarity.  A Cuban man drove me from the airport to a hotel down close to the Modern. A nice cabbie that talked and calmed a very fear-filled kid trying to figure out her life. Just a kind man. That's all. I was very nervous, unsure where I was, he was a great help, and I must have just told him I was afraid of not having too much money so I couldn't afford to pay more than thirty dollars. I was afraid of being overcharged. I know he didn't do that, my funds were so limited. I told him that. And I tipped him. I think he helped me get a room at a place I could afford. There is a point. A few days later I ran into him at Central Park at a festival. He and I just happily chatted like friends as he played some gaming thing on a day I needed to feel safer. It's a small world but this movie reminds me of how sometimes life hugs you in a very small corner. It allows you to listen to the tune played on the jazz piano. It gives you the blessing of a nice glass of rose.( I cannot figure out the accent on that e)  And someone might actually wait for you to finish your class, as this new acquaintance does for Kate, or even walks with you all night or takes the risk to follow where someone leads.Or takes a hand or asks a favor.Actually I've read the plot summarized here and at on-line movie sites ten times or more, when debating whether or not to risk my going out walking with such serious problems going on underfoot, so it isn't what I'd want to say-another synopsis. It wouldn't get it anyway. He goes to the wedding, is hurt by being replaced by the step dad told by the daughter in walking her down the aisle, meets this interesting, wary and lovely woman, loses his job, takes a risk, suffers a arrhythmia, almost misses a chance that he needs, she needs. And then there is her mom, calmly wondering if the neighbor is smoking bodies in the shed.It's a little cozy movie about the lovely warmth of holding a hand and strolling into the life of another, because it's just righter than retreat.I loved the littlest things. That there is some very old man in her writing class reading his sexual passages, that Harvey collapses when made to walk the kazillion flights of stairs at his hotel in London, both elevators off, that Emma Thompson wears this lovely silk lined raincoat so beautifully, that he goes to the pre wedding dinner with a white linen suit, crumpled with the tag not removed by the store, you know those inky ones, that they allow us to feel all the awkward staring discomfort, that Kate rolls up a little jacket or sweater to put under a child's head when they are belatedly seated at a child's table after the wedding at the reception. That he plays her a tune on the piano and asks her to stay, calming her discomfort knowing his own. That he gives her, and she him, the benefit of the doubt. That Kate goes to the rail with such anxiety when he tells her he's there, going to be there, why he missed her, and she sits and looks and admits to all the real fear of being hurt.And he just absorbs that, and says he won't let her down.I wish I could write to do it justice. It's small and it's everything.

If they thought this tired vehicle would revive their flagging careers, they are dead wrong.Hoffman plays a 60-something composer of advertising jingles down on his luck, flying to London to attend his daughter's wedding.

I suppose when I see a movie that's descibed as a romantic movie, I expect a somewhat uplifting story that makes me feel good. This movie was not that type of movie in my opinion. A large part at the start of the movie is dedicated to making the main characters look about as destitute and sad as possible, beyond the point where you can still imagine some kind of happy turnaround later. When the time comes for them to finally meet, the Harvey character seems to step out of character to a degree and become almost a quasi-stalker. Rather than being charming, he comes across as a pushy older guy looking to latch on to a younger female. I felt that there was very little chemistry between the two characters and seemingly little in common to attract them to one another other than their mutual status as sad and lonely people. Finally, it seemed like a lot of the aspects of the movie were sort of forced and not very realistic. It's hard to believe Harvey is a musician, that his daughter would be getting married in London, that he would be so spontaneous as to do all the things he does in the last half of the movie, that he could afford to just keep hanging out in expensive London hotels when he has obviously been down on his luck with his job, and the list goes on. I suppose if you are a fan of Hoffman you might find this to be yet another interesting performance, or if you are a fan of Thompson's portratal of a sad character, you might like her performance.

Niedt,"[0, 0]","Harvey Shine is down to last chances:  his job as a commercial jingle writer is hanging by a thread; his estranged daughter is getting married, giving him perhaps one last chance to reconcile and make amends, and his lonely life has perhaps one last chance at romance.  He flies to London for the weekend to attend the wedding, only to get a cool reception from the wedding party, and when his daughter tearfully informs him that she wants her stepfather (James Brolin) to give her away, you can see his heart break.  Meanwhile, never-married Kate Walker has a thankless job as an airport survey taker, and a demanding mother (Eileen Atkins).  When she's set up on yet another blind date, this time with a younger man who ends up paying more attention to some friends he runs into the bar, you can feel her loneliness.  After ducking out of the wedding after the ceremony, missing his flight, and learning that he's about to be sacked, Harvey comes to drown his sorrows in an airport lounge and meets Kate (for the second time, it turns out).  Once they start trading barbed comments, you know this one is on a familiar romantic comedy track.  But what makes this movie work is the two principals:  Hoffman and Thompson are two Oscar-winners who are always a joy to watch, and together they make terrific chemistry.  As it happens, they first met when filming ""Stranger than Fiction"" a couple of years ago, and despite sharing only a scene or two in that film, they instantly clicked and became friends.  So they eagerly agreed to work on this project, only the second feature directed by writer/director Joel Hopkins.  The featurette on the DVD gives us some insight into their working relationship, and it turns out much of the chemistry is very real and some of the scenes were even improvised.  They capture perfectly the bond of two lonely and apparently different people, and the magic that a middle-aged romance can generate. (And how many good ""middle-aged romance"" comedies have you seen lately?)  They even transcend a plot twist straight out of ""An Affair to Remember"". The supporting cast is strong too, especially Atkins, Brolin, and Kathy Baker (playing Harvey's ex-wife). It doesn't hurt, either, that the film is beautifully shot in London, perhaps my favorite city in the world.

1150237,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0015OKWKS,Chris Pandolfi,"[88, 98]","Watching ""Last Chance Harvey,"" I began to think about other such films and realized that I usually referred to them in my reviews as classic romantic comedies. But what exactly do I mean when I say that? In all likelihood, I mean that readers should go easy on the film because we're used to those movies following a very specific formula, and never mind the fact that they're contrived and clich&eacute;. I could very well call ""Last Chance Harvey"" a classic romantic comedy, because goodness knows it adheres to a tried and true structure. In spite of that, this is the one romantic comedy of 2008 that works the best, in large part because of stars Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson; whereas other filmmakers would cast young, energetic actors in a story about sex, writer/director Joel Hopkins has cast two older actors in a story is about love. Because they're more experienced, they actually bring something to the table. They seem genuine as people.But more importantly, they have chemistry, not necessarily as lovers but definitely as companions. In other words, it seems plausible that such people could meet in real life and fall in love. Hoffman plays Harvey Shine, a jingle writer from New York who always wanted to be a jazz pianist. It was easy for me to empathize with him, a somber, soft-spoken man who always feels ignored in a large crowd. Maybe there's a part of him that wanted it that way; he's been known to embarrass himself and those closest to him, so at a certain point, it's better to just stay out of the way. He openly admits that he wasn't the greatest father or husband, and while there's no hostility between him or his daughter and ex-wife, there is a quiet yet prominent sense of disappointment on all accounts. And now, no one at his music company seems to be taking him seriously. More to the point, he's on the verge of losing his job.When Harvey flies to London to attend his daughter's wedding, he meets a Heathrow employee named Kate Walker (Thompson), who, as it turns out, is stuck in her own emotional rut. She says she would like nothing more than to meet someone and start a relationship, but since she's been let down so many times, she may be getting used to it. Later on in the film, she admits that being disappointed is more comfortable that being hurt. Much like Harvey, she also feels ignored in crowds, as when she's on a blind date that starts off well but ends up as a social gathering that leaves her off in the sidelines. Her only social outlets are her coworkers and her mother (Eileen Atkins), an interesting character herself; she calls Kate constantly, pretty much to the point of insanity, and she seems to think her Polish next-door neighbor is a mass murderer who burns his victims in a large barbecue shed.Harvey and Kate spend a wonderful afternoon together, and this is despite the fact that they don't know very much about each other. We don't know if a love is developing at this point, but it's clear that a friendship is. While a bit quiet and reserved, Harvey is kind towards Kate, and he seems genuinely interested in what she has to say. Kate is willing to go along with it, although her nervous smiles and hesitant laughter suggest that she has absolutely no idea why any of this is happening. From out of nowhere comes a charming American man, and even though he has a lot of emotional baggage, there's the sense that she's interested in helping him deal with it. Most likely, that's because she has baggage of her own; after convincing her to join him at his daughter's wedding reception, there comes a point when she feels exactly the same as she did the night of her blind date. It's up to Harvey to make her feel like she can be a part of the crowd.There are some interesting moments between Harvey and his daughter, Susan (Liane Balaban). Even though they love each other in the strictest sense, they are more good friends than they are father and daughter, which is why she wants her stepfather, Brian (James Brolin), to give her away at the wedding. Harvey is understandably hurt, but he can't stay mad at Brian forever; after all, he did take over for Harvey when his marriage failed, giving Susan the stability and attention she needed. This would be a tiresome story were Brian made to be vindictive and hostile. Thankfully, he isn't--he's decent and accommodating, a fact Harvey most likely has trouble accepting. There are few things worse than disliking someone without having a reason.So yes, I guess I can call ""Last Chance Harvey"" a classic romantic comedy. But that doesn't automatically make it a bad movie. What really made it work well was the thoughtful relationship between Harvey and Kate, which isn't based on physical attraction so much as it's based on the need to be loved. We don't get too much of that in romantic comedies these days. Even the entertaining ""Definitely, Maybe"" and ""My Best Friend's Girl"" were only committed to catering to younger audiences, which is a shame because the filmmakers missed some great opportunities to develop the characters at a more mature level. ""Last Chance Harvey"" gives its characters some degree of believability, and this is in spite of the story's formulaic elements. I greatly enjoyed this film, and I'm sure most audiences will also.",4,Finding Love in a Foreign Land,1230681600,"12 31, 2008",2008,5280,"['Watching', 'Last', 'Chance', 'Harvey', 'began', 'think',

The first two-thirds or so of the movie present a dual character study, beautifully acted by Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson, of two people I couldn't help but like who stumble into each other's lives. Each with their charms and their baggage, the progress of their relationship could not be predicted, but offered a subject for hope.Then it happened. Apparently the producers insisted on lobotomies for the writers as a condition of continued employment.The pair agree to meet ""tomorrow at noon."" Just in case you missed it, one character makes the other repeat this, twice. These are sophisticated, mature adults in the twenty-first century. They both have cell phones (we know this because they're constantly being interrupted). Why do they never bother to exchange phone numbers?No points for guessing the next plot twist. :-(Having set up this entirely contrived dramatic tension, ""Last Chance Harvey"" proceeds to resolve it and treat that as a resolution of the film... totally abandoning the worthwhile story that could have been built from the drama inherent in the characters themselves. We get no answers to the interesting questions, just the rather dull completion of a plot clich&eacute; that should have been put to rest two decades ago.Five stars for Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson, four and a half for the first two-thirds of the movie, and one and a half for the brain-dead conclusion.",3,"Lovely dual character study, until someone decided it needed a plot",1245456000,"06 20, 2009",2009,1472,"['was', 'moment', 'Last', 'Chance', 'Harvey', 'when', 'heart', 'sank', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'so', 'movie', 'present', 'dual', 'character', 'study', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'two', 'people', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'who', 'stumble', 'other', 'lives', 'charms', 'baggage', 'progress', 'relationship', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'predicted', 'offered', 'subject', 'hope.Then', 'happened', 'Apparently', 'producers', 'insisted', 'lobotomies', 'writers', 'condition', 'continued', 'employment.The', 'pair', 'agree', 'meet', 'tomorrow', 'noon', 'Just', 'case', 'missed', 'one', 'character', 'other', 'repeat', 'twice', 'are', 'sophisticated', 'mature', 'adults', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'have', 'cell', 'phones', 'know', ""'re"", 'constantly', 'being', 'interrupted', 'Why', 'do', 'never', 'bother', 'exchange', 'phone', 'numbers', 'points', 'guessing', 'next', 'plot', 'twist', 'Having', 'set', 'up', 'entirely', 'contrived', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'Last', 'Chance', 'Harvey', 'proceeds', 'resolve', 'treat', 'resolution', 'film', 'totally', 'abandoning', 'worthwhile', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'built', 'drama', 'inherent', 'characters', 'get', 'answers', 'interesting', 'questions', 'just', 'rather', 'dull', 'completion', 'plot', 'clich', 'eacute', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'rest', 'two', 'decades', 'ago.Five', 'stars', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'four', 'half', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'movie', 'one', 'half', 'brain-dead', 'conclusion']",Last Chance Harvey
1150240,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B0015OKWKS,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[1, 1]","Before Sunset meets An Affair to Remember meets As Time Goes By. All wonderful films / programs in their own right. Last Chance Harvey pulls some of the best bits of these into a charming love story. It's a very simple sweet ride to the finish. Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman are simply wonderful to watch in this film. Add some of the more beautiful cinematography in some time, a nice soundtrack, and this is a very good film.After watching the DVD special featurette, it turns out that Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman improvised a very big portion of the script. They both tried to make a film that is less characters they played and more of themselves. That realism worked well for me.The film takes a bit of time to really get going. Harvey, Dustin Hoffman, is a jingle writer. His daughter, who he hasn't seen much because she lives with her mother, Kathy Baker, and her rich husband, James Brolin. Harvey must leave New York to attend his daughter's wedding in London. Through chance meetings, Harvey and Kate, Emma Thompson, meet eachother. It's this relationship that is the centerpiece of this film. It's fun to watch how these two meet, and I will not ruin that surprise.Emma Thompson is simply gorgeous as a slightly older woman that has never really found love. Dustin Hoffman is an older somewhat grizzlied schlub that says and does all the wrong things. He plays the part extremely well. When I think of all the roles this amazing actor has played, Tootsie (a transexual), The Graduate (a young innocent man), Rain Man (an autistic savant) , Midnight Cowboy (a down and out Ratso), and Meet the Fockers (a hippie sexologist married to Barbara Streisand). It is amazing to think of Hoffman's range as an actor; and how he plays this role different from all the rest with subtlty. The supporting cast is wonderful, James Brolin - Mr. Handsome perfection, Kathy Baker - the b__ch ex-wife, and Toby from West Wing - the slimy producer.Technically this movie is a mixed bag. The framing and cinematography is remarkable. This film is lit perfectly. The backgrounds were selected with extreme care. The sound was crystal clear. The film is a pure pleasure to watch from the colors and framing used. There are several continuity slip ups, sadly they are pretty noticeable. James Brolin is holding a large wine glass in one shot during the toast. The tag on Hoffman's coat is missing in a few scenes. It's nits, I know, but somebody wasn't doing their job on the set to allow these things. There was a bit of a pacing problem at a transition point. The film starts off with two parallel stories - we follow Harvey and then for the same amount of time follow Kate. This rhythm sets up and works very well. Until the two actually meet. At this point the film loses its way for about 15 minutes. The director then moves into a more standard melodrama type shooting and pacing; and the film recovers.The film is PG-13 and is rated perfectly. There's nothing more adult in this film. No strong language. No nudity. No violence. In fact, in many ways this is more like a PG film. Maybe the MPAA felt the subject matter deserved the higher rating? There's nothing wrong with the rating, this is an older couple falling in love. There is no reason to be explicit. It's a romantic love story that tells very well with the language and visuals it has chosen. Who in their right mind wants to see more of flesh exposed of either of these actors? Another case for not understanding the MPAA at all.A perfectly timed 1 hour and 30 minutes. The DVD includes one bonus feature, a behind the scenes featurette. As I mentioned earlier in this review, it's worth watching the 12 minutes. I learned a lot about this film.In that bonus feature, Eileen Atkins, Kate's mother in the movie, says something to the effect that this is a charming lovely movie with a little streak of melancholy. That about sums up this very nice film.",5,Charming Love Story,1243209600,"05 25, 2009",2009,3919,"['Sunset', 'Affair', 'Remember', 'meets', 'Time', 'Goes', 'wonderful', 'films', '/', 'programs', 'own', 'right', 'Last', 'Chance', 'Harvey', 'best', 'bits', 'charming', 'love', 'story', 'very', 'simple', 'sweet', 'ride', 'finish', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'are', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'film', 'Add', 'more', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'time', 'nice', 'soundtrack', 'very', 'good', 'film.After', 'watching', 'DVD', 'special', 'featurette', 'out', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'improvised', 'very', 'big', 'portion', 'script', 'tried', 'make', 'film', 'less', 'characters', 'played', 'more', 'realism', 'worked', 'well', 'me.The', 'film', 'bit', 'time', 'really', 'get', 'going', 'Harvey', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'jingle', 'writer', 'daughter', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'much', 'mother', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'rich', 'husband', 'James', 'Brolin', 'Harvey', 'must', 'leave', 'New', 'York', 'attend', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'London', 'chance', 'meetings', 'Harvey', 'Kate', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'meet', 'eachother', 'relationship', 'centerpiece', 'film', 'fun', 'watch', 'how', 'two', 'meet', 'will', 'not', 'ruin', 'surprise.Emma', 'Thompson', 'simply', 'gorgeous', 'slightly', 'older', 'woman', 'never', 'really', 'found', 'love', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'older', 'somewhat', 'grizzlied', 'schlub', 'wrong', 'things', 'part', 'extremely', 'well', 'When', 'think', 'roles', 'amazing', 'actor', 'played', 'Tootsie', 'transexual', 'Graduate', 'young', 'innocent', 'man', 'Rain', 'Man', 'autistic', 'savant', 'Midnight', 'Cowboy', 'down', 'Ratso', 'Meet', 'Fockers', 'hippie', 'sexologist', 'married', 'Barbara', 'Streisand', 'amazing', 'think', 'Hoffman', 'range', 'actor', 'how', 'role', 'different', 'rest', 'subtlty', 'supporting', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'James', 'Brolin', 'Mr', 'Handsome', 'perfection', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'b__ch', 'ex-wife', 'Toby', 'West', 'Wing', 'slimy', 'producer.Technically', 'movie', 'mixed', 'bag', 'framing', 'cinematography', 'remarkable', 'film', 'lit', 'perfectly', 'backgrounds', 'were', 'selected', 'extreme', 'care', 'sound', 'was', 'crystal', 'clear', 'film', 'pure', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'colors', 'framing', 'used', 'are', 'several', 'continuity', 'slip', 'ups', 'sadly', 'are', 'pretty', 'noticeable', 'James', 'Brolin', 'holding', 'large', 'wine', 'glass', 'one', 'shot', 'toast', 'tag', 'Hoffman', 'coat', 'missing', 'few', 'scenes', 'nits', 'know', 'somebody', 'was', ""n't"", 'doing', 'job', 'set', 'allow', 'things', 'was', 'bit', 'pacing', 'problem', 'transition', 'point', 'film', 'two', 'parallel', 'stories', 'follow', 'Harvey', 'then', 'same', 'amount', 'time', 'follow', 'Kate', 'rhythm', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'two', 'actually', 'meet', 'point', 'film', 'way', '15', 'minutes', 'director', 'then', 'more', 'standard', 'melodrama', 'type', 'shooting', 'pacing', 'film', 'recovers.The', 'film', 'PG-13', 'rated', 'perfectly', 'nothing', 'more', 'adult', 'film', 'No', 'strong', 'language', 'nudity', 'violence', 'fact', 'many', 'ways', 'more', 'PG', 'film', 'Maybe', 'MPAA', 'felt', 'subject', 'matter', 'deserved', 'higher', 'rating', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'rating', 'older', 'couple', 'falling', 'love', 'reason', 'be', 'explicit', 'romantic', 'love', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'language', 'visuals', 'chosen', 'Who', 'right', 'mind', 'see', 'more', 'flesh', 'exposed', 'actors', 'case', 'not', 'understanding', 'MPAA', 'all.A', 'perfectly', 'timed', '1', 'hour', '30', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'one', 'bonus', 'feature', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'review', 'worth', 'watching', '12', 'minutes', 'learned', 'lot', 'film.In', 'feature', 'Eileen', 'Atkins', 'Kate', 'mother', 'movie', 'something', 'effect', 'charming', 'lovely', 'movie', 'little', 'streak', 'melancholy', 'sums', 'very', 'nice', 'film']",Last Chance Harvey

It's part character study, part awkward exchanges, and what it's like ""out there"" when you aren't young any more.Harvey Shine is in a job he slightly hates writing commercial jingles, Kate Walker has been tossed so often in love that her mother has made it her mission to constantly call and remind Kate about her lack luster love life and keep her company.

1150244,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B0015OKWKS,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[0, 0]","Admittedly, director Joel Hopkins wants to tell a love story about two life's-got-me-down individuals in his film ""Last Chance Harvey"" starring Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson.  Without the added accoutrement of madcap comedy or the usual boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-wins-girl entanglements, he does manage to showcase two actors with some pleasant chemistry between them in a fairly realistic storyline that promenades to a satisfying conclusion.Physically, Thompson and Hoffman have a difficult time cutting a rug together.  She towers over him considerably which makes for some awkward footage of the two of them walking along the Thames and dancing at a wedding reception.  Not that any of this really matters, the duo share a companionable attraction for one another that offsets (most of the time) their corporal disparity.  Hoffman, as Harvey Shine, remains a conglomerate of his best known character studies:  he mixes a little of Rain Man's doggedness, Michael Dorsey's/Tootsie's clumsiness and the Graduate's insouciance to inject Harvey with the lifeblood of Hoffman's usually depicted anti-hero.  His portrait of Harvey smacks of realism that adds another dimension to an otherwise ordinary screenplay.Likewise, as Kate Walker, the incomparable Emma Thompson knows how to play a nuanced mature woman on the brink of throwing in the towel after so many years of mediocrity.  Her tired willingness in dealing with her job and her frustrated ministrations to her needy mother (the wonderful Eileen Atkins) rings with the quiet truth of the many who are life's caretakers rather than actual participants.  Hopefulness beams on her face with the timidity of all things tenuous; we don't want her to be disappointed and cannot hold back our winces when Harvey/Hoffman faux-pas with extraordinary gaucheness.Nevertheless, their coupling does work as an older couple meeting and falling in love despite a plotline heaped with so many dour situations it makes the audience cringe with dismay.  In a film where nothing really happens, a lot happens between the two leads supported by a cast of experts that put the ""A"" in archetypical.  Look for a snowy-haired James Brolin as the warm and witty stepfather, Kathy Baker as the still-annoyed ex-wife and Liane Balaban as the daughter caught in past crossfire.Bottom line?

Girl and boy have misunderstanding, but iron it out.Well, imagine that scenario for the fiftysomething set. ""Last Chance Harvey"" is one of those thoroughly mediocre little movies that only manages to make itself memorable because it happens to star great actors. Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson manage to turn this middle-of-the-road romantic comedy into something worth watching on a lazy summer afternoon, as long as you don't expect much plot.The titular character (Hoffman, natch) is a down-on-his-luck musician/jingle-writer who visits England for his daughter's wedding, but fate seems determined to make him miserable -- women ignore him, his daughter has dropped him in favor of her stepfather, and he's humiliated at the rehearsal dinner. The only person who hasn't caused poor Harvey to drop further is pretty Kate Walker (Thompson), an interviewer whom Harvey brushes off at the airport.Unsurprisingly, when they actually spend some time together, Kate and Harvey begin to click and Harvey starts openly pursuing this new woman who actually treats him like a human being. His self-confidence and charm begin to grow as Kate begins to reciprocate his feelings -- but when they hit a sudden snag in their first date, Harvey may have lost his last chance.""Last Chance Harvey"" is one of those plots that has been around for eons, especially in movies: lonely single people reluctantly find love with each other, despite a few ""Love Affair"" obstacles and misunderstandings, and turn their miserable pathetic lives around. It's neither a really good movie nor a bad one -- just sort of average, especially since the climactic obstacle turns out to be a really contrived, rather overwrought misunderstanding. Bleah.But it does have a certain amount of charm, once Joel Hopkins has finished heaping every kind of indignity imaginable on Harvey without resorting to slapstick (seriously, give the guy a break!). There's  a certain sweetness to seeing some perpetually disappointed people suddenly blossoming in utterly ordinary ways -- shopping, conversing, and getting awkwardly to know each other. And some of the gentle humor is amusing as well -- such as Kate's mother being convinced that her neighbor is a serial killer.Honestly, this movie would be forgettable if it weren't for Hoffman and Thompson, both of whom are sublimely awkward, sweet and touching. Hoffman seems like a quietly enduring presence that is constantly beaten down by the world, but never gives in; and though it's not terribly convincing that someone who looks like Emma Thompson would be a lonely spinster, she is definitely Hoffman's match and (though no clear answers are given) obviously the person who belongs with him.And thankfully there are no cheap ploys for audience sympathy, just a pair of strong presences that fill the entire movie. The supporting actors also do a good job -- nobody is demonized even if they do Harvey wrong -- but they're overshadowed by the two leads.""Last Chance Harvey"" is one of those ""nice"" little movies that are pleasant but unexceptional in any way, except for the lead actors.

1150251,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0015OKWKS,Ed Uyeshima,"[0, 0]","At its best, this rather slight 2008 melding of comedy and drama reminds me of Ulu Grosbard's bittersweetFalling in Love(1984) in which Robert DeNiro and Meryl Streep stumble into a romantic relationship constantly derailed by guilt and commuter train schedules. At its worst, this film - leisurely directed and written by Joel Hopkins - uses several well-worn cinematic conventions - including a familiar third-act plot device from a classic movie - and forces a predictable ending that is far from satisfying. On the upside, it certainly helps to have actors the caliber of Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson in the principal roles, although I have to admit I was not taken in by their characters' halting romance because the actors are simply not meshing in a convincing way. In fact, this movie ironically works better when the actors perform in separate scenes away from each other. The problem is that the elfin Hoffman just tries too hard to overcome Thompson's self-protective demeanor of disappointment.The story focuses on Harvey Shine, a divorced jingle writer whose career seems to be waning in the face of more youthful talent. At the same time, his daughter Susan is getting married in England, so he is anxious to offset his professional disappointments with a family reunion he really needs. However, their estrangement turns out to be deeper than expected since Susan tells him that she has already asked her rugged, engaging stepfather to give her away at the wedding. When he concludes that it is he who has become the family outsider, he meets Kate Walker, an airport employee who has the thankless task of surveying passengers coming off their flights. She also happens to be a lonely spinster who lives near her paranoid mother and finds the prospect of another failed blind date excruciating. Kate and Harvey meet-cute at a Heathrow lounge at their lowest emotional points, and they start to bond over long walks along London's South Bank. She convinces him to go to Susan's reception, and he agrees only if Kate becomes his date. The rest of the plot follows the story arc you would expect.In perhaps a conscious move, Hoffman seems to be channeling a bit of Benjamin Braddock's schlubby, obsessive nature inThe Graduateover forty years later. He is at his best when we feel Harvey's rejection in isolation, but the assertive approach the 71-year-old actor takes in courting Kate is challenging to embrace. Thompson, on the other hand, is a pure joy as Kate because she plays against the grain of what could have been a victim character. She wears Kate's disappointment in such a convincingly objective manner that her moments of heartache attain greater resonance. Eileen Atkins and Kathy Baker have just a few scenes to bring their characters to life, Kate's dotty mother and Harvey's still-resentful ex-wife, respectively. London looks pretty inviting thanks to John de Borman's crisp cinematography, though Dickon Hinchliffe's tinkling music punctuates the proceedings excessively. The 2009 DVD contains a nice audio commentary track with Hoffman (recorded separately), Hopkins and a particularly acerbic Thompson. The sixteen-minute featurette reflects the same personalities in a standard making-of format, although both this and the theatrical trailer give away too much of the plot.",3,A Conventional Third Act Weighs Down a Leisurely Autumnal Romantic Yarn,1243728000,"05 31, 2009",2009,3312,"['best', 'rather', 'slight', '2008', 'melding', 'comedy', 'drama', 'Ulu', 'Grosbard', 'bittersweetFalling', 'Love', '1984', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'stumble', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'constantly', 'derailed', 'guilt', 'commuter', 'train', 'schedules', 'worst', 'film', 'leisurely', 'directed', 'written', 'Joel', 'Hopkins', 'several', 'well-worn', 'cinematic', 'conventions', 'including', 'familiar', 'third-act', 'plot', 'device', 'classic', 'movie', 'predictable', 'ending', 'far', 'satisfying', 'upside', 'certainly', 'have', 'actors', 'caliber', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'principal', 'roles', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'not', 'taken', 'characters', 'halting', 'romance', 'actors', 'are', 'simply', 'not', 'meshing', 'convincing', 'way', 'fact', 'movie', 'ironically', 'better', 'when', 'actors', 'perform', 'separate', 'scenes', 'away', 'other', 'problem', 'elfin', 'Hoffman', 'just', 'too', 'hard', 'overcome', 'Thompson', 'self-protective', 'demeanor', 'disappointment.The', 'story', 'focuses', 'Harvey', 'Shine', 'divorced', 'jingle', 'writer', 'career', 'be', 'waning', 'face', 'more', 'youthful', 'talent', 'same', 'time', 'daughter', 'Susan', 'getting', 'married', 'England', 'anxious', 'offset', 'professional', 'disappointments', 'family', 'reunion', 'really', 'However', 'estrangement', 'out', 'be', 'deeper', 'expected', 'Susan', 'already', 'asked', 'rugged', 'engaging', 'stepfather', 'give', 'away', 'wedding', 'When', 'who', 'become', 'family', 'outsider', 'Kate', 'Walker', 'airport', 'employee', 'who', 'thankless', 'task', 'surveying', 'passengers', 'coming', 'off', 'flights', 'also', 'be', 'lonely', 'spinster', 'who', 'paranoid', 'mother', 'prospect', 'failed', 'blind', 'date', 'excruciating', 'Kate', 'Harvey', 'meet-cute', 'Heathrow', 'lounge', 'lowest', 'emotional', 'points', 'start', 'bond', 'long', 'walks', 'London', 'South', 'Bank', 'go', 'Susan', 'reception', 'only', 'Kate', 'date', 'rest', 'plot', 'story', 'arc', 'would', 'expect.In', 'perhaps', 'conscious', 'move', 'Hoffman', 'be', 'channeling', 'bit', 'Benjamin', 'Braddock', 'schlubby', 'obsessive', 'nature', 'inThe', 'Graduateover', 'forty', 'years', 'later', 'best', 'when', 'feel', 'Harvey', 'rejection', 'isolation', 'assertive', 'approach', '71-year-old', 'actor', 'courting', 'Kate', 'challenging', 'embrace', 'Thompson', 'other', 'hand', 'pure', 'joy', 'Kate', 'grain', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'victim', 'character', 'Kate', 'disappointment', 'such', 'convincingly', 'objective', 'manner', 'moments', 'heartache', 'attain', 'greater', 'resonance', 'Eileen', 'Atkins', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'have', 'just', 'few', 'scenes', 'bring', 'characters', 'life', 'Kate', 'dotty', 'mother', 'Harvey', 'still-resentful', 'ex-wife', 'respectively', 'London', 'pretty', 'inviting', 'thanks', 'John', 'de', 'Borman', 'crisp', 'cinematography', 'Dickon', 'Hinchliffe', 'tinkling', 'music', 'proceedings', 'excessively', '2009', 'DVD', 'nice', 'audio', 'commentary', 'track', 'Hoffman', 'recorded', 'separately', 'Hopkins', 'particularly', 'acerbic', 'Thompson', 'sixteen-minute', 'featurette', 'same', 'personalities', 'standard', 'making-of', 'format', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'plot']",Last Chance Harvey

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","Ah, yes, the main portion of my concentration at one point in this film was Dustin Hoffman's resemblance to Peter Falk's COLUMBO. It was kind of fun to picture the character of Lt. Columbo instead of Harvey Schein. (However they spell it--is it Shine?)Anyway...this is an excellent we're-at-the-brink-of-our-golden-years theater piece. It cannot be easy to make a ""feel-good"" movie, and believe me, anything touted by its producers as such, will be anything but feel-good. LAST CHANCE HARVEY is a feel-good, well done. What I can't understand is why there isn't a comma before Harvey's name in the title. Should be there.This is a gentle and very sane love story between a disillusioned American commercial songwriter and a British airport survey-taker. Dustin Hoffman could fit into any role even now, and Emma Thompson...same thing! What can one really say about those two? When I saw the teasers for this, I was hooked and loved the movie already. Those two, together!I was prepared to love this even if it included incest, date rape and tea-bagging.It is a wonderful anytime, anywhere story...even the soundtrack, made to sound like an old-fashioned tv commercial, helped it along. I felt there was real chemistry between these two giants, and perhaps the film is trying to say something about how they themselves feel right now in their careers. People have sneered at Hoffman, saying he wanted the money. They have insulted Emma Thompson, too.Fact is that this is simply a quality picture, and I think they must have jumped at the chance to work together. How James Brolin got dragged in I know not; the charm of the supporting cast is just right.

That makes the movie and character believable and thus easier to swallow.(2.) The movie as a whole is one unrealistic scene after another that includes Harvey in a parking garage where a phone call from his boss says he lost his job; he lost the love of his wife and older daughter for reasons not clear; he makes everyday decision mistake after mistake as the movie plods on.

Unfortunately, there are too many awkward and embarrassing moments during the first 30 minutes before they meet, and there are too many subplots: the one involving the mother and her suspicions about her neighbor is totally extraneous. The wonderful Eileen Atkins is completely wasted. In fact, the film-makers could have gotten the point across quite well--a dependent relative stifling a child--using the device of a frequent cell phone caller who is never seen. Why not just let these two wonderful actors do what they do best - act out their initial tentativeness and the increasing ease they find with each other as they spend more time together.

However, somewhere towards the middle of the movie, I found myself quietly drawn into caring about them and eagerly wanted to find out what destiny had in store for the two.Dustin Hoffman stars as Harvey Shine, a seemingly successful jingle composer who has made a good life for himself. However, as the story unfolds, Harvey is quietly depressed, lonely and disappointed with himself that he has never quite measured up in life.  We learn that he is divorced and preparing to fly to London to attend his daughter's wedding although he has been alienated from her for some time.  To make matters worse, he is told by his boss that the jingle he is working on for a TV advertisement had better be a home run or else.  Arriving in London, Harvey crosses paths with Emma Thompson's character Kate Walker, a survey taker at Heathrow airport.  In a hurry, Harvey brushes her off and we soon learn that Kate is no stranger to disappointment in her life as well.  Hurt one too many times, Kate would like to meet that special someone but really isn't willing to risk being hurt anymore and instead spends her time reading, hanging out with friends and checking on her mother who lives alone.  Like Harvey, she too is quietly sad, lonely and depressed, facing the reality that she may never know fulfillment.  Both are actually good and capable people but somewhere along the line inertia set in and they let the losses in their lives overwhelm them, living each day with regret rather than seeking their true dreams and desires.As the movie progresses, Harvey and Kate struggle with more disappointment when their paths cross once again.  It is here where the movie begins to get interesting.  Harvey and Kate do not make an instant love connection.  In fact, they make anything but.  What unfolds is actually a tender and honest portrait of a friendship in the making that may or may not lead to a physically romantic relationship.  It is this developing friendship, this tentative sharing with one another about each's hopes, dreams and yes, losses, that provides the drama for the movie.  Some people may not like this movie because, like Harvey and Kate, it takes some investment to realize its payoff.  The drama that builds is more subtle than earth shattering. But, because of this, the story is much more plausible and as such, the ending much more rewarding and fulfilling than many other romantic comedies/dramas.",3,Subtle but worth it,1267920000,"03 7, 2010",2010,2500,"['movie', 'slow', 'feel', 'invested', 'characters', 'However', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'movie', 'found', 'quietly', 'caring', 'eagerly', 'wanted', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'destiny', 'had', 'store', 'two.Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Harvey', 'Shine', 'seemingly', 'successful', 'jingle', 'composer', 'who', 'made', 'good', 'life', 'However', 'story', 'unfolds', 'Harvey', 'quietly', 'depressed', 'lonely', 'disappointed', 'never', 'quite', 'measured', 'up', 'life', 'learn', 'divorced', 'preparing', 'fly', 'London', 'attend', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'been', 'alienated', 'time', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'told', 'boss', 'jingle', 'working', 'TV', 'advertisement', 'had', 'better', 'be', 'home', 'run', 'else', 'Arriving', 'London', 'Harvey', 'paths', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'character', 'Kate', 'Walker', 'survey', 'taker', 'Heathrow', 'airport', 'hurry', 'Harvey', 'off', 'soon', 'learn', 'Kate', 'stranger', 'disappointment', 'life', 'well', 'Hurt', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'Kate', 'would', 'like', 'meet', 'special', 'someone', 'really', ""n't"", 'willing', 'risk', 'being', 'hurt', 'anymore', 'instead', 'time', 'reading', 'hanging', 'out', 'friends', 'checking', 'mother', 'who', 'alone', 'Harvey', 'too', 'quietly', 'sad', 'lonely', 'depressed', 'facing', 'reality', 'may', 'never', 'know', 'fulfillment', 'are', 'actually', 'good', 'capable', 'people', 'somewhere', 'line', 'inertia', 'set', 'let', 'losses', 'lives', 'overwhelm', 'living', 'day', 'regret', 'rather', 'seeking', 'true', 'dreams', 'desires.As', 'movie', 'Harvey', 'Kate', 'struggle', 'more', 'disappointment', 'when', 'paths', 'cross', 'once', 'again', 'here', 'where', 'movie', 'get', 'interesting', 'Harvey', 'Kate', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'instant', 'love', 'connection', 'fact', 'make', 'anything', 'What', 'actually', 'tender', 'honest', 'portrait', 'friendship', 'making', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'lead', 'physically', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'developing', 'friendship', 'tentative', 'sharing', 'one', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'yes', 'losses', 'drama', 'movie', 'people', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'Harvey', 'Kate', 'investment', 'realize', 'payoff', 'drama', 'more', 'subtle', 'earth', 'shattering', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'plausible', 'such', 'ending', 'much', 'more', 'rewarding', 'fulfilling', 'many', 'other', 'romantic', 'comedies/dramas']",Last Chance Harvey

The story just grows on you.Here you have a man who is on his last legs of his long successful career going to a strange land to attend his estranged daughter's wedding.  He is met with so many obstacles and difficulties where you think he is ready to give up.  Yet, he keeps going, moving ever forward, believing there is something out there.You also see a wonderful person who is highly involved with her mom who is divorced.  She really never seems to get on with people and has a few hang ups in life where she toils in what is a lonely world for her.Amazingly, this story is only a weekend long, but you feel a sense of the characters full lives.  One snippet here and one there gives you full view.  This is an amazingly crafted story as well.You see Harvey Shine (Hoffman) consistently pursue his new interest, Kate Walker (Thompson) after all of his world has seemingly collapse.  It gives you the feeling that maybe that is how he did his work all these years.  Yet, his work and his life are the cause of some of the way things turned out.  You learn about his whole family life in one conversation with his ex played by Kathy Baker, who is married to Jame Brolin, playing the effusive and very much liked step dad.Yet we are not left without some picture of hope for the lonely.  Life continues there is another day to come and in the end instead of a euphoric ending we get to see that just beginning.The extra in this video of the reasons behind the film are just excellent.  In fact anyone seeing this immediately after the movie, may look and even be more impressed.  One of the trailers in the DVD is the 'Visitor.'

Kate lives close to her clinging mother and has a job conducting surveys at Heathrow airport.

1150278,A3NVNNLSVEVZ99,B0015OKWKS,just Jack,"[5, 8]","Beautifully acted, a well crafted story and film, Last Chance Harvey may well become a classic of its time.Other reviews will give you the bare bones of this story. Many will be somewhat disappointed. There are no crash, bang, wallops, no magical special effects, no deaths, no wild sex scenes, and no wacky out-of-this-world crazy characters. The emotions of Last Chance Harvey lie subtly between the lines, behind the faade; in the traditions of English and French literary cinema. Last Chance Harvey comes from the stable of such classics as Notting Hill, which successfully cross over to an American audience. After the 'B' movie disaster films of Hoffman's mid-life career, it is good to see Dustin back, again, in a character deserving of his acting skill.Look for instance at the gentle nostalgia. 'Hello lamppost what you knowing?' Last Chance Harvey gently acts the feelings of many baby-boomers who missed or got emotionally screwed the liberated 60's and now face their last chance of finding happiness in their golden years. Watch the flower growing. Last Chance Harvey is a maturely romantic comedy. Dig out the gem of Simon and Garfunkel's 'Bridge Over Troubled Waters.' If you are not old enough to do that, then read on and learn to avoid the mistakes of your generation.Every generation repeats the patterns and mistakes of the past. Men sell their creative souls to the commercial machine. Dustin Hoffman's character dreamt of being a jazz pianist but instead spent a life writing advertising jingles. The kind of music John Lennon disparagingly described as 'musac'. Competing in a stressful demanding world,  such men neglect the relationships that are most important to all. Their children. Last Chance Harvey stands as a judgement by a generation on the `gift' of easy divorce. Sacrifices made for a career, only to find oneself dumped on the scrap heap of ageism.Emma Thompson's character is a spinster whose life is ruled by a demanding dependent mother. Thompson's mother is a cancer survivor crippled by the psychological effects of impending death. Seeing death everywhere, she is fearful of time apart from her daughter.Surely in this age, intelligent independent women are liberated from such self-sacrifice. Surely there are treatments, places to care, for the aged? Reality is different, even today. Can any generation abandon its parents?Sometimes the chains of dependency are self-imposed. Thompson's character is just as dependent on her mother. It protects her from repeating the greatest mistake of her life.Last Chance Harvey is story of loss. Loss of loved ones, of unborn children; loss of career; self-concept; the loss of innocence, loss of the romantic dreams of adolescence, and the loss of a caring society. `Don't leave me here', is Dustin's unspoken plea to a perfect stranger. Not in this place in life.In the days of instant gratification, uncontrolled consumption, thoughtless greed and instant celebrity, Last Chance Harvey even laments the loss of skills and the pleasure of craft. The writer's group is not just a device to create anxiety in the separation of characters falling in love; it is also a device to illustrate a theme.

With these two powerhouse actors, with the quality of story the directors and producers had to work with, I cannot believe they ended up with such a substandard product. Shame on all of them! The story is about two lonely, older people who have not achieved their dreams, meet inexplicably at an airport bar and in real-world time, managed to strike up a relationship, go shopping for clothing suitable for a wedding, and then make it TO the wedding in about what I calculated had to be no more than two hours. I am one who can stretch my imagination almost to the tipping point, but this movie also expected us to believe that the character played by Hoffman changed from a frumpy, down-in-the-dumps loser into an upbeat, talented, somewhat engaging personality, while sitting at that airport bar, after spying Ms. Thompson's character alone at a table, reading a book.After being subjected to abject humiliation by Hoffman's daughter's kind of ridiculous decision to have her step father walk her down the aisle, which is another critique I could go into altogether, I tipped over that edge and slipped down that cliff when Hoffman and Thompson show up (two hours later, mind you) at the reception, and somehow, Hoffman manages to overcome all of his miseries and unfair experiences at this wedding and give what, I think was supposed to be, a tear-jerking toast to his undeserving daughter and new husband.All I can say is, if Hoffman and Thompson were NOT in this movie, I wouldn't be writing this review. This one would have gone where all the other bad movies go to die. Two stars for two great actors.

This 93 minute movie is rated PG-13 and stars Dustin Hoffman (Harvey Shine) and Emma Thompson (Kate).  James Brolin plays a fairly brief part as the Step-Father (Brian) of Harvey's daughter (Susan Shine) and husband of Harvey's ex-wife (Jean).  The story line is about 2 people who are not having any luck with relationships, but they find out it is never too late to meet a mate, while Susan Shine is preparing to and marrying her love, Scott.Harvey is a pianist who writes jingles and background music for commercials and he's not exactly burning the notes off the pages.  He is seriously close to losing his job.  Harvey lives in the US and daughter Susan lives in London with Jean and Brian, so Harvey must go to London for the wedding.  He does not exactly feel very welcomed when he arrives and finds out that Jean rented a house for everyone else and a hotel room for him and he doesn't exactly jive with the others either when he arrives at the rehearsal dinner. He decides he will just stay for the wedding and skip the reception.  As he tells Susan, she explains that she has asked Brian to give her away (Ouch!).Meanwhile, Kate is a survey-taker at the airport.  She actually meets Harvey when he first gets off the plane but he tells her he is in a hurry and runs off.  Kate has a mother who believes her neighbor is weird and thinks he has a body in the shed.  Momma calls Kate constantly on the cell phone to complain about the neighbor.  Kate has no social life so her co-worker tries to set her up with a blind date.  That bums out when the guy's friends show up at the pub and Kate does not seem to fit in.  After the wedding, Harvey goes to the airport only to find out he cannot fly out until the next day.  In an airport pub, he actually meets Kate and they hit it off.The movie is good, but nothing outstanding-nothing earth-shattering.  It is just fine performances by 2 fine actors.  No action--it is a love story about 2 good people who stumble upon a relationship with each other.  It is a movie for the hopeful romantic.  Things might not be what you want right now, but they can change overnight, and will never be the same again.There is also a hidden message in the story.  When things aren't working and you act differently (as Harvey did later in the day), people relate to you differently.

Although he had dreamed of becoming a jazz pianist, he writes jingles for a living and he has done his job well for many years.

The story: New York jingle-writer Harvey Shine (Hoffman) is on his last legs in a job that's passing him by, and he tears himself away from the daily crisis to attend his daughter's wedding in London. Long divorced, Harvey hasn't been close to his daughter and he's very much on the outside among the wedding party. His daughter has asked her step-father (James Brolin) to give her away. Harvey bags the reception, misses a plane home, gets fired over the phone, and takes refuge in a pub.Meanwhile Kate Walker (Thompson) is cruising toward spinsterhood, at her quirky mother's beck and call; she has bagged a bad blind date and is--oh, can you guess?--taking refuge in the same pub. Overture, rebuff, repeat.These two lonely souls somehow, in spite of a script full of lame repartee, get together and tell their stories. Kate is horrified that Harvey is missing his daughter's reception and insists that he attend. He tows her along. Harvey, although seated at the children's table, rises to the occasion and all is happy.Well, it's not quite that simple, but nearly. The lead actors give their usual excellent performances but the romantic tension just isn't there. Writer/director Joel Hopkins delivers a movie that's pleasant enough but not memorable, except for the recurring scenes in which Kate's mother spies on her new neighbor of whom she is highly suspicious. Don't leave before the credits roll, or you will miss the final scene in this play-within-a-play.This was not a terrible way to spend ninety minutes on an airplane, but it's not a movie I'd yearn to see again; just a little too wordy and lacking in plausibility. But I WOULD like to watch the wedding scene one more time, to find out if my brain at sea level would once again channel ""The Graduate"" while watching Dustin Hoffman at his daughter's wedding.Linda Bulger, 2009",3,Father of the bride,1239840000,"04 16, 2009",2009,2074,"['list', 'proposed', 'pairings', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'would', 'expect', 'see', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'No', 'probably', 'not', 'ButLast', 'Chance', 'Harveyputs', 'troupers', 'together', 'London', 'results', 'are', 'bit', 'surprising', 'story', 'New', 'York', 'jingle-writer', 'Harvey', 'Shine', 'Hoffman', 'last', 'legs', 'job', 'passing', 'away', 'daily', 'crisis', 'attend', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'London', 'Long', 'divorced', 'Harvey', ""n't"", 'been', 'close', 'daughter', 'very', 'much', 'outside', 'wedding', 'party', 'daughter', 'asked', 'step-father', 'James', 'Brolin', 'give', 'away', 'Harvey', 'bags', 'reception', 'plane', 'home', 'fired', 'phone', 'refuge', 'pub.Meanwhile', 'Kate', 'Walker', 'Thompson', 'cruising', 'spinsterhood', 'quirky', 'mother', 'beck', 'call', 'bagged', 'bad', 'blind', 'date', 'oh', 'can', 'guess', 'taking', 'refuge', 'same', 'pub', 'Overture', 'rebuff', 'repeat.These', 'two', 'lonely', 'souls', 'somehow', 'spite', 'script', 'full', 'lame', 'repartee', 'get', 'together', 'tell', 'stories', 'Kate', 'horrified', 'Harvey', 'missing', 'daughter', 'reception', 'attend', 'along', 'Harvey', 'seated', 'children', 'table', 'occasion', 'happy.Well', 'not', 'quite', 'simple', 'nearly', 'lead', 'actors', 'give', 'usual', 'excellent', 'performances', 'romantic', 'tension', 'just', ""n't"", 'there', 'Writer/director', 'Joel', 'Hopkins', 'movie', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'not', 'memorable', 'recurring', 'scenes', 'Kate', 'mother', 'spies', 'new', 'neighbor', 'whom', 'highly', 'suspicious', 'Do', ""n't"", 'leave', 'credits', 'roll', 'will', 'miss', 'final', 'scene', 'play-within-a-play.This', 'was', 'not', 'terrible', 'way', 'spend', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'airplane', 'not', 'movie', ""'d"", 'yearn', 'see', 'again', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'wordy', 'lacking', 'plausibility', 'WOULD', 'watch', 'wedding', 'scene', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'find', 'out', 'brain', 'sea', 'level', 'would', 'once', 'again', 'channel', 'Graduate', 'watching', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'daughter', 'wedding.Linda', 'Bulger', '2009']",Last Chance Harvey

1150291,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B0015OKWKS,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[1, 1]","Harvey Shine (Dustin Hoffman) is going through a mid-life crisis of sorts.  A younger guy's jingle seems to be the favorite at work and his job is in jeopardy.  His daughter seems to be rejecting him in favor of her handsome stepfather, played by James Brolin.  Harvey also seems to have an issue doing anything right.  If there is such a thing as a non-golden touch, Harvey has it.Kate Walker (Emma Thompson) is not having a mid-life crisis, but neither is her life very exciting.  She is resigned to stability, which does not involve a man, or anyone, it seems.  She even finds her mother annoying.  Perhaps it is better to say that she clings to stability.  Kate appears to fear change because she is afraid of being hurt.These two people meet when Harvey arrives in London for his daughter's wedding.  Kate is asking questions for a survey and Harvey is in no mood for answering questions.  The meeting is hardly auspicious.Harvey attends his daughter's wedding but misses his flight back to the U.S. because of heavy traffic.  Harvey calls his boss, who fires him.  Harvey heads for an airport bar where he sees Kate.  Harvey apologizes to Kate for his earlier behavior, but his real reason for approaching Kate is that he needs someone to listen to him.  Kate, of course, is completely uninterested in listening to Harvey, another rude, nearly obnoxious traveler.What follows is a nearly formulaic movie as Kate and Harvey do a relationship dance and try to break from their normal routine.  We could almost write the ending along with the obligatory facial tissue and a marginal sniff.The best thing this movie has going for it is star horsepower.  Emma Thompson has either won or been nominated for more than 80 awards, including two Oscar wins.  Dustin Hoffman has won or been nominated for more than 70 awards, including two Oscar wins.  The supporting cast includes veterans Kathy Baker, James Brolin and many others.  With all the star horsepower, this movie seems as though it would be a sure-fire winner.  Sadly, it is not.This movie plods.  Harvey's only charming attribute is the face of Dustin Hoffman, which is insufficient to carry the day.  Emma Thompson's Kate is much more charming and I liked her, but romance between Harvey and Kate is just too improbable.  Even if I suspended belief, I still struggle to see these two getting together.  Even if they do get together, the pace of the movie is so slow that I hardly cared.I must admit that romantic movies are hardly my favorite.  However, I do enjoy a well-plotted love story.  I loved ""The Graduate,"" ""Love Story,"" ""The Taming of the Shrew,"" and dozens more.  This movie is a vague shadow of those movies.There are few romantic movies about mature adults in the middle years of their lives.  This movie had a lot going for it, especially great actors and an award-winning director.  Unfortunately, the story seemed to be too far outside the director's experience and it falls flat, even with Hoffman and Thompson adlibbing some of the scenes.  I give this one three stars because there is some chemistry between Hoffman and Thompson and I do like a happy ending.  I am disappointed because this movie could have been so much more.Good luck!",3,"So Much Star Power, So Little of Interest",1302393600,"04 10, 2011",2011,3216,"['Harvey', 'Shine', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'going', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'sorts', 'A', 'younger', 'guy', 'jingle', 'be', 'favorite', 'work', 'job', 'jeopardy', 'daughter', 'be', 'rejecting', 'favor', 'handsome', 'stepfather', 'played', 'James', 'Brolin', 'Harvey', 'also', 'have', 'issue', 'doing', 'anything', 'right', 'such', 'thing', 'non-golden', 'touch', 'Harvey', 'it.Kate', 'Walker', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'not', 'having', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'life', 'very', 'exciting', 'resigned', 'stability', 'not', 'involve', 'man', 'anyone', 'even', 'mother', 'annoying', 'Perhaps', 'better', 'say', 'stability', 'Kate', 'fear', 'change', 'afraid', 'being', 'hurt.These', 'two', 'people', 'meet', 'when', 'Harvey', 'London', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'Kate', 'asking', 'questions', 'survey', 'Harvey', 'mood', 'answering', 'questions', 'meeting', 'hardly', 'auspicious.Harvey', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'flight', 'back', 'U.S.', 'heavy', 'traffic', 'Harvey', 'boss', 'who', 'Harvey', 'heads', 'airport', 'bar', 'where', 'Kate', 'Harvey', 'Kate', 'earlier', 'behavior', 'real', 'reason', 'approaching', 'Kate', 'someone', 'listen', 'Kate', 'course', 'completely', 'uninterested', 'listening', 'Harvey', 'rude', 'nearly', 'obnoxious', 'traveler.What', 'nearly', 'formulaic', 'movie', 'Kate', 'Harvey', 'do', 'relationship', 'dance', 'try', 'break', 'normal', 'routine', 'could', 'almost', 'write', 'ending', 'along', 'obligatory', 'facial', 'tissue', 'marginal', 'sniff.The', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'going', 'star', 'horsepower', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'won', 'been', 'nominated', 'more', '80', 'awards', 'including', 'two', 'Oscar', 'wins', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'won', 'been', 'nominated', 'more', '70', 'awards', 'including', 'two', 'Oscar', 'wins', 'supporting', 'cast', 'veterans', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'James', 'Brolin', 'many', 'others', 'star', 'horsepower', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'sure-fire', 'winner', 'Sadly', 'not.This', 'movie', 'plods', 'Harvey', 'only', 'charming', 'attribute', 'face', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'insufficient', 'carry', 'day', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Kate', 'much', 'more', 'charming', 'liked', 'romance', 'Harvey', 'Kate', 'just', 'too', 'improbable', 'Even', 'suspended', 'belief', 'still', 'struggle', 'see', 'two', 'getting', 'together', 'Even', 'do', 'get', 'together', 'pace', 'movie', 'so', 'slow', 'hardly', 'cared.I', 'must', 'admit', 'romantic', 'movies', 'are', 'hardly', 'favorite', 'However', 'do', 'enjoy', 'well-plotted', 'love', 'story', 'loved', 'Graduate', 'Love', 'Story', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'more', 'movie', 'vague', 'shadow', 'movies.There', 'are', 'few', 'romantic', 'movies', 'mature', 'adults', 'middle', 'years', 'lives', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'going', 'especially', 'great', 'actors', 'award-winning', 'director', 'Unfortunately', 'story', 'seemed', 'be', 'too', 'far', 'director', 'experience', 'flat', 'even', 'Hoffman', 'Thompson', 'adlibbing', 'scenes', 'give', 'one', 'three', 'stars', 'chemistry', 'Hoffman', 'Thompson', 'do', 'happy', 'ending', 'am', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more.Good', 'luck']",Last Chance Harvey

The man and woman in question are not glamorous-looking twenty-somethings.2. They are in fact played by Academy Award winning performers.Other than that ""Harvey"" has much in common.1. There is a ""meet cute"".  All romantic comedies must have the ""boy-meets-girl"" scene, and since the leads are played by Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson, this scene is a little better than most.  This if followed by one of those genre montages where our couple walks blissfully around London getting to know each other, except that we hear the soundtrack and see their smiling faces rather than listen to their dialogue.  (If your movie stars Hoffman and Thompson, wouldn't you WANT them to be talking and smiling instead of just smiling?)2. There is a scene where Harvey and Kate are supposed to meet for a ""second date"", and one of them is unable to make it for a reason that the other person would instantly understand if they only knew, but they don't know, leading the other person to think that they've been stood up.3. There is a variation on my least favorite Romantic Comedy clich&eacute; - the scene near the end when it looks like they're not going to be together, but the male character realizes he's making a Big Mistake and rushes to the airport to catch his destiny.  Most of the variation in THIS rendition of the clich&eacute; comes because Kate WORKS at the airport, so Harvey has to meet her there.Several romantic comedies have featured ""lovable losers"", but I suppose that the ""twist"" in this story is that Harvey has ""hit bottom"".  He wanted to be a jazz pianist, but his ability is only good enough to write music to accompany television commercials.  Even in this dreams-not-achieved world he is barely hanging onto his job as he flies to London for the wedding of his estranged daughter.  The daughter is completely assimilated into the world of the ex-wife and the step-father.  Harvey is an uncomfortable fish out of water.  Kate seems at least secure in her job as an airport poll-taker, although her social life's highlight is her mother, who phones about once an hour to describe the strange goings-on of her neighbor.""Last Chance Harvey"" is well-done fluff, the film equivalent of cotton candy.",3,A Competently Made Romantic Comedy sans Spring Chickens,1242086400,"05 12, 2009",2009,2294,"['Last', 'Chance', 'Harvey', 'Romantic', 'Comedy', 'different', 'brethren', 'because:1', 'man', 'woman', 'question', 'are', 'not', 'glamorous-looking', 'twenty-somethings.2', 'are', 'fact', 'played', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'performers.Other', 'Harvey', 'much', 'common.1', 'meet', 'cute', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'must', 'have', 'boy-meets-girl', 'scene', 'leads', 'are', 'played', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'scene', 'little', 'better', 'most', 'followed', 'one', 'genre', 'montages', 'where', 'couple', 'walks', 'blissfully', 'London', 'getting', 'know', 'other', 'hear', 'soundtrack', 'see', 'smiling', 'rather', 'listen', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'stars', 'Hoffman', 'Thompson', 'would', ""n't"", 'WANT', 'be', 'talking', 'smiling', 'instead', 'just', 'smiling', '2', 'scene', 'where', 'Harvey', 'Kate', 'are', 'supposed', 'meet', 'second', 'date', 'one', 'unable', 'make', 'reason', 'other', 'person', 'would', 'instantly', 'understand', 'only', 'knew', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'leading', 'other', 'person', 'think', ""'ve"", 'been', 'stood', 'up.3', 'variation', 'least', 'favorite', 'Romantic', 'Comedy', 'clich', 'eacute', 'scene', 'end', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'be', 'together', 'male', 'character', 'making', 'Big', 'Mistake', 'rushes', 'airport', 'catch', 'destiny', 'Most', 'variation', 'THIS', 'rendition', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Kate', 'WORKS', 'airport', 'so', 'Harvey', 'meet', 'there.Several', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'have', 'featured', 'lovable', 'losers', 'suppose', 'twist', 'story', 'Harvey', 'hit', 'bottom', 'wanted', 'be', 'jazz', 'pianist', 'ability', 'only', 'good', 'enough', 'write', 'music', 'accompany', 'television', 'commercials', 'Even', 'dreams-not-achieved', 'world', 'barely', 'hanging', 'job', 'London', 'wedding', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'daughter', 'completely', 'assimilated', 'world', 'ex-wife', 'step-father', 'Harvey', 'uncomfortable', 'fish', 'water', 'Kate', 'least', 'secure', 'job', 'airport', 'poll-taker', 'social', 'life', 'highlight', 'mother', 'who', 'about', 'once', 'hour', 'describe', 'strange', 'goings-on', 'neighbor', 'Last', 'Chance', 'Harvey', 'well-done', 'fluff', 'film', 'equivalent', 'cotton', 'candy']",Last Chance Harvey
1150296,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0015OKWKS,Mark Turner,"[6, 8]","It seems these days that theaters across the country are filled with the latest blockbuster, always a techno touch of wizardry that titillate the audience while at the same time offering total entertainment but little meat to the bones. But occasionally a film comes along that deals with emotions, usually a small film without major pizzazz. LAST CHANCE HARVEY is such a film and one worth seeing.Dustin Hoffman plays Harvey Shine, a jingle writer for a large advertising firm. Out of touch with the electronic music era and more in touch with actual instruments, Harvey is the last of his kind, so much so that if his latest account doesn't sell he's out of work.This particular weekend Harvey is to fly to London for his daughter's wedding. Divorced from her mother for some time, one gets the feeling that Harvey was always more concerned with career than family. His daughter's closeness to her mother and step father proves this later on.Kate Walker (Emma Thompson) is a 40something woman who works for a survey company asking questions of travelers as they disembark from their planes in London. Kate constantly has to take care of her mother either by visit or via cell phone non stop. It is through her job that she first bumps into Harvey as he abruptly brushes her off.Harvey hits the hotel booked for him only to find out that everyone else is staying in a house his ex-wife has booked for the entire party. He does finally get the chance to be with the wedding party though as they gather the night before the wedding. Hoffman's Harvey gets to show off his somewhat out of place character as he takes cell phone calls for work and stumbles about, both physically and verbally. It is on this night that Harvey's daughter informs him that she intends to have her step father (played by James Brolin) to walk her down the aisle. Crushed but understanding, Harvey retreats to his room.The next day Harvey has the chance to see his daughter married, but has to return home for a business meeting thus missing the reception. Due to traffic he misses his plane and is summarily fired by his boss. While having a drink he bumps into Kate once again who acts stand offish but eventually sees something nice in Harvey. The pair spend the day together as Harvey invites himself into her life, eventually inviting her into his when he asks her to accompany him to the reception.The pair makes a nice fit. Both have been up and down in the world of romance and both have battle scars to prove it. But at the reception Harvey gets a chance to come out of his shell, winning back his daughter's affection and perhaps the heart of a woman he just met.The title of the film sums it up. This is Harvey's last chance. Not just at the job he has (though hates, wishing he was a jazz piano player instead) but life as well. He may have lost his old family, but a chance at romance that blossoms naturally with someone he's just met makes for a heartwarming story that captures the essence of what love is all about.Not the love we seems to find offered all the time in films these days where teenage angst and romance involves who can get whom into bed first, but a deeper more meaningful affection that will last when the physical passion retreats. The emotions shared between the characters of Harvey and Kate, two people who meet and fall in love in a day, is something that perhaps older viewers can relate to better. Too bad younger ones will miss this one for the next teen pop tart, never realizing what true love is all about.Hoffman has always done a fantastic job. He turns in a subtle performance here, one that I think is better than I've seen from him in recent years. He's relaxed in the skin of Harvey Shine. Thompson does an upstanding job as well, bringing the woman on the verge of spinsterhood alive as she sees an opportunity present itself but at the same time fears the consequences should it fail, while loss of love inflicts pain on everyone, loss of love at the later stages of life offers more mortal wounds.This movie was missed by many when it hit theaters.

1150297,A3U3BEZMH3F01Q,B0015OKWKS,maskirovka,"[1, 2]","I really wanted to like ""Last Chance Harvey.""  This is because I like romantic comedies where the leads are something closer to real people than the likes of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.  So a movie that has Dustin Hoffman (who I felt was incredible in ""the Graduate"" and ""Rain Man"") and Emma Thompson (who I've loved watching in many films) should have been something I liked.But for some reason I didn't like it.  Why is that?&lt;spoilers>I think the answer to that question is twofold.  First, the plot seemed to be a bit of reach.  I could believe that two people who were ""lost souls"" might hit it off like Hoffman and Thompson's character did.  I just think that they would have needed more time to do so than just walking around for a day.  If I had been reading the script for ""Last Chance Harvey"" in advance of it being made into a film, I would have asked the producers, ""Can't the writer come up with a way to throw the two characters together for a couple of days at least?""That's what happened in the movie ""the Holiday,"" another romantic comedy that had two women (Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet) fall rapidly in love with two men (Jude Law and Jack Black).  In the case of that movie, however, the timeline was two weeks.  While the idea people would really, REALLY get to know each other in that time was a bit of a stretch, it was a lot more believable than ""Last Chance Harvey"" and its much shorter timeline.The other problem with the plot was its failure to explain why everyone in the movie apart from Emma Thompson was so mean to Dustin Hoffman's character.  Take the case of Hoffman's character's daughter.  She and he had apparently grown apart since he got divorced from her mom.  She had grown closer to her stepdad.  So she decided she wanted him to give her away at the altar.  I could see someone deciding to do that.  I really could.  But for the life of me, I don't see how the daughter would have waited until her (real) father had flown all the way over to London to attend the wedding and sprung that rather nasty surprise on him the day before.  With no explanation, doing that just seemed cruel.So I was disappointed by this movie, but I know a lot of people liked it.  So some time in the future, I may take another crack at it...which is why I gave it three stars and not the one or two I really felt it deserved.",3,Rather Disappointing...Maybe I Will Try It Again Sometime in the Future,1252108800,"09 5, 2009",2009,2350,"['really', 'wanted', 'Last', 'Chance', 'Harvey', 'like', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'where', 'leads', 'are', 'something', 'closer', 'real', 'people', 'likes', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'movie', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'felt', 'was', 'incredible', 'Graduate', 'Rain', 'Man', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'who', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'watching', 'many', 'films', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'liked.But', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'Why', 'lt', 'spoilers', '>', 'think', 'answer', 'question', 'twofold', 'First', 'plot', 'seemed', 'be', 'bit', 'reach', 'could', 'believe', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'lost', 'souls', 'might', 'hit', 'off', 'Hoffman', 'Thompson', 'character', 'did', 'just', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'needed', 'more', 'time', 'do', 'so', 'just', 'walking', 'around', 'day', 'had', 'been', 'reading', 'script', 'Last', 'Chance', 'Harvey', 'advance', 'being', 'made', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'asked', 'producers', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'writer', 'come', 'up', 'way', 'throw', 'two', 'characters', 'together', 'couple', 'days', 'least', 'what', 'happened', 'movie', 'Holiday', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'had', 'two', 'women', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'fall', 'rapidly', 'love', 'two', 'men', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Jack', 'Black', 'case', 'movie', 'however', 'timeline', 'was', 'two', 'weeks', 'idea', 'people', 'would', 'really', 'REALLY', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'time', 'was', 'bit', 'stretch', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'believable', 'Last', 'Chance', 'Harvey', 'much', 'shorter', 'timeline.The', 'other', 'problem', 'plot', 'was', 'failure', 'explain', 'why', 'everyone', 'movie', 'apart', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'was', 'so', 'mean', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'character', 'Take', 'case', 'Hoffman', 'character', 'daughter', 'had', 'apparently', 'grown', 'apart', 'got', 'divorced', 'mom', 'had', 'grown', 'closer', 'stepdad', 'decided', 'wanted', 'give', 'away', 'altar', 'could', 'see', 'someone', 'deciding', 'do', 'really', 'could', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'daughter', 'would', 'have', 'waited', 'real', 'father', 'had', 'flown', 'way', 'London', 'attend', 'wedding', 'sprung', 'rather', 'nasty', 'surprise', 'day', 'explanation', 'doing', 'just', 'seemed', 'cruel.So', 'was', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'liked', 'time', 'future', 'may', 'take', 'crack', 'why', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'really', 'felt', 'deserved']",Last Chance Harvey

And ""Wow, Emma Thompson looks great!"" Hoffman is Harvey Shine, professional New York advertising jingle writer who regrets never having become a jazz pianist. He and his wife split some years ago (he wasn't that great a husband or father, as he admits) and now his daughter is getting married in London. Having flown over to take part, he finds she wants her stepfather to give her away instead. Moreover, his career is falling apart and his boss finally sacks him by cell phone. That's half the set-up. There's also Emma as Kate Walker, self-employed as (apparently) an airport poll-taker with a couple of employees and a neurotic mother, whose social life seems to consist of going on blind dates set up by her friends only to be abandoned by whomever she's with. Harvey, naturally, bumps into Kate both arriving in the country and attempting to depart. But the airline screws up and he's delayed in London for another day, and the two sort of drift together -- largely because Harvey rather desperately insists on trying to establish a relationship. His doggedness about it is wince-provoking; in real life, Kate probably would tell him to sod off. But the funny thing is, in this story, it works. They spend a good deal of time walking and talking, Kate finally drags him to the wedding reception he hadn't meant to attend, and things work out finally with his daughter. It's a matter of Harvey trying to organize what is clearly his ""last chance"" for any kind of happiness and of the never-married Kate trying to decide whether to take the chance of being hurt.

She'll tower over him.  Who thought this up?  It's got to be quirky or artsy-fartsy, and he's simply going to whine on my nerves.Storyline: a divorced, music ad/'jingle toons' composer heads off to England to attend his estranged daughter's wedding.

In the 'making of' section, both actors relate how they wanted to be more like themselves and more natural.  Neither all neurotic or goofy, but intelligent and complex.

And there are no bad people in the story just poor first impressions and life decisions.All the actors are good.

She has a way of getting around a role a creating a whole character.That said, Last Chance Harvey is just a rehash of the the accidental meeting turning into a last chance at love movie but this movie is elevated by its stars.Dustin Hoffman plays Harvey, a divorced jingle writer at a crossroads in his life and career.  Emma Thompson is Kate, a single woman who has settled into that life.Harvey's daughter is getting married in London.  Kate gathers travel data at a London airport.  Kate tries to interview Harvey on his arrival but he blows her off.Harvey is crushed by his daughter's request that her step father (James Brolin) walk her down the aisle and Harvey decides to bolt.  But due to traffic, Harvey misses his flight home and runs into Kate again but this time at an airport cafe.Harvey tries to strike up a conversation with Kate but she rebuffs him.  Harvey persists and starts an uneasy friendship.  This friendship blossoms when Kate forces Harvey to attend his daughter's reception.  Harvey gives a very moving bride's father's toast.Harvey and Kate wind up spending the rest of the night together and watch the sun rise.  Harvey asks Kate to meet him at the fountain again.  She shows up but Harvey has an attack of arithmia and is hospitalized.  Kate thinks that it was just one of those things and moves on.  But Harvey decides it is not which leads to Kate's great scene - one which only Emma could make totally believable and engrossing.As I started out, you might feel that you have seen this before but Emma Thompson uses her charm, beauty and ablility to make words sing to bring this above average.  Dustin Hoffman matches well with Thompson, they have a great chemistry and hopefully they will make more films together --- and find a script truely worthy of their combined talents.DVD EXTRAS - Making of featurette - Note to EMMA - you make a comment that this you are tired are romances with beautiful people.

1150310,A1PZF2ZLAG4DCX,B0015OKWKS,nepos,"[1, 1]","There is an early scene which sets the story for me. It is when Harvey (Dustin Hoffman), a commercial jingle writer, is in flight to London to attend his daughter's wedding. Harvey has tried to converse with his seat neighbor who cooly rebuffs him. A lone cone of light from overhead shines down on Harvey in the dark airplane cabin, as he is surrounded by sleeping passengers. Here we are introduced to a lonely man, who never seems to fit in with the crowd, who is unable to say the right things at social gatherings, who drinks a little too much. He confesses at one point in the story that he has always felt his own family was embarrassed of him. We see this as he sits in his hotel room alone in London, as he tries to connect especially with his ex-wife and daughter at the reception.His last chance comes as he is arriving at the Heathrow terminal and is approached by Kate Walker (Emma Thompson) an airline agent who conducts passenger surveys. Kate is single, sort of stuck at a place in life with a nervous clinging mother, and  who no longer fits in with the younger single scene. Harvey bumps into Kate again when he decides to fly back to New York before the wedding after he learns that his daughter has asked her step father to give her away at the altar. Harvey casts out the line one last time in the airport bar when he tries to engage Kate in conversation over lunch.Some film viewers have remarked how unlikely it would ever be for these two people to be paired together. However it is possible, and that is what makes it a delightful love story, especially for those of us who feel by passed by life. It would be a 5 star movie for this romantic, however some of the ""side bar"" stories in the film merely water down the blossoming of the relationship between Harvey and Kate.",4,Let's Be Lonely Together,1244937600,"06 14, 2009",2009,1797,"['early', 'scene', 'story', 'when', 'Harvey', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'commercial', 'jingle', 'writer', 'flight', 'London', 'attend', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'Harvey', 'tried', 'converse', 'seat', 'neighbor', 'who', 'cooly', 'rebuffs', 'lone', 'cone', 'light', 'overhead', 'shines', 'down', 'Harvey', 'dark', 'airplane', 'cabin', 'surrounded', 'sleeping', 'passengers', 'Here', 'are', 'introduced', 'lonely', 'man', 'who', 'never', 'fit', 'crowd', 'who', 'unable', 'say', 'right', 'things', 'social', 'gatherings', 'who', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'point', 'story', 'always', 'felt', 'own', 'family', 'was', 'embarrassed', 'see', 'hotel', 'room', 'alone', 'London', 'connect', 'especially', 'ex-wife', 'daughter', 'reception.His', 'last', 'chance', 'arriving', 'Heathrow', 'terminal', 'approached', 'Kate', 'Walker', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'airline', 'agent', 'who', 'passenger', 'surveys', 'Kate', 'single', 'sort', 'stuck', 'place', 'life', 'nervous', 'clinging', 'mother', 'who', 'no', 'longer', 'fits', 'younger', 'single', 'scene', 'Harvey', 'bumps', 'Kate', 'again', 'when', 'fly', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'wedding', 'daughter', 'asked', 'step', 'father', 'give', 'away', 'altar', 'Harvey', 'out', 'line', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'airport', 'bar', 'when', 'engage', 'Kate', 'conversation', 'lunch.Some', 'film', 'viewers', 'have', 'remarked', 'how', 'unlikely', 'would', 'ever', 'be', 'two', 'people', 'be', 'paired', 'together', 'However', 'possible', 'what', 'delightful', 'love', 'story', 'especially', 'who', 'feel', 'passed', 'life', 'would', 'be', '5', 'star', 'movie', 'romantic', 'however', 'side', 'bar', 'stories', 'film', 'merely', 'water', 'down', 'blossoming', 'relationship', 'Harvey', 'Kate']",Last Chance Harvey

The story initially dealt with two individuals played by Hoffman and Thompson who were each separately immersed in deep sadness.Harvey (Hoffman) struggles with personal emptiness, yet still makes the effort to fly to London to attend his daughter's wedding. From the start, he is the Odd-Man Out, displaced from his daughter's life by his former wife and her new husband. Hapless, glum, and alone, Harvey finds himself in an unexpected circumstance.The lady Kate, (Emma Thompson), has her own demons. She, too, rarely smiles. Her world includes a housebound mother who suspects her neighbor of sinister wrongdoing and a cell phone that keeps ringing. Her attempts to inject fun and socializing into her life aren't quite working out.  Overall, it seems, she is quite lonely and she rarely smiles.By chance, these two individuals meet. Their short walk keeps getting longer as they discover they have a lot to talk about.  Harvey and Kate smile and laugh together more and more. The humor of the film is subtle and pleasant.The ultimate destination of their paths is predictable. However, it is uplifting and joyful to see Harvey and Kate come into their own and at the same time, come together.I happened to watch this with someone who saw it in the case, said dismissively, ""looks like a Chick-Flick"".  He frequently falls asleep in movies or walks out.  Very discriminating-a film has to be good!Well, he watched this film in its entirety and enjoyed it a lot.Last Chance Harvey is a surprising sleeper of a film.  All viewers were riveted to the screen as Hoffman and Thompson are clearly superb performers.This is a lovely film; cinematography is excellent.  Do watch the widescreen version-the scenery in London is beautiful and adds to the viewer's enjoyment.

I think I'm angry at you for trying to take that away."" - Emma ThompsonRisk taking was easily accessible in our youth because stocking everything on the table didn't feel like much of a risk. It was affordable too, perhaps because we hadn't yet piled our chips high. But that's what happens as we age. Responsibilities wield in, we succumb to formula, acquire empires, and a risk feels like, well, a risk.That's where Harvey comes in. While ultimately successful in his once-aspiring career, he's taken his as far as it will go. Fast forward to his daughter Susan's London wedding to a fianc&eacute; whom Harvey's never met and an x-wife with a husband, who's taken his seat as Susan's new go-to father. And then there's Kate, a middle-aged woman working in an international airport, of all ironic places, but has never actually aspired to vigor. Life, it seems, has finally passed them by.The problem here is two mismatched extremes. Harvey's disappointed with life while Kate is comfortable with disappointment.

1150314,A16IM9MYTHCKYQ,B0015OKWKS,Penumbra,"[0, 0]","""Last Chance Harvey"" is a rare example of a modern Hollywood romantic comedy featuring a mature couple meeting and falling in love.  The leads, Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson, are top tier performers who put a lot of heart into their work.  Neither of them seem to be overly challenged with the material in this film, but romantic comedies are by nature lightweight and predictable.  Although this movie delivers on the formula, ultimately the romance angle didn't work for me.Harvey Shine (Hoffman) is a New York advertising executive and jingle writer who hops a plane to London to attend his daughter's wedding.  In London he finds himself marginalized in all the wedding plans; his daughter even informs him that she has decided to ask her stepfather to give her away.  He misses his flight home.  He is fired from his job over the phone.  Following that perfect storm of a bad day he decides to slam down a few Jack Daniels in the airport lounge and this is when he meets Kate Walker (Thompson).What I liked most about this movie were the performances.  Thompson shows no fear of being ""dowdied up"" for her role as a middle aged, middle class spinster in a dead end job.  She is a few pounds heavier than we're used to seeing, wears polyester and a ponytail scrunchie, and allows herself to be photographed from various unflattering angles.  Even with all this, it's impossible to disguise that this is a beautiful woman with a good nature and a generous heart. She's irresistible.Hoffman, on the other hand, may have been too good at fleshing out Harvey.  At times he comes across as a desperate stalker, forcing his company on this polite lady, following her onto her commuter train, and waiting for her outside her classroom.  She really doesn't know much about this guy when she agrees to accompany him to the wedding reception.  What we see (and why doesn't Kate?) is that this guy is not well liked by those family and friends who know him best; he rudely abandons Kate at the kid's table while he dances with a variety of partners and only resumes his efforts with Kate after she has quietly gotten up to leave.While I'd love to be able to recommend ""Last Chance Harvey"" without reservations, I found it impossible to suspend disbelief enough to imagine it working out for these two.  During the course of this movie the couple has an acquaintance of less than 24 hours.  Kate has been on the receiving end of Harvey's rude behavior more than once, but that doesn't seem to matter.  We should be grateful that Hollywood didn't go the usual route of casting a 20-something actress as Kate, but I found the age gap of 20+ years quite significant when the younger partner is pushing 50.  (Thompson was 49 and Hoffman 70; she mentions in the commentary that she's playing around 44 and he's playing around 65. Oh, well...THAT makes it better.)  To further complicate matters, she has a dead end job; he's unemployed.  She lives in London; he lives in White Plains, NY. The list goes on.  Part of what makes falling in love at 50 different from falling in love at 20 is that people have learned something more about life. Kate and Harvey are too old to throw caution to the wind like teenagers, but too young for their dotage.Oddly, the DVD package includes two disks.  The basic difference appears to be that one has the film in wide screen presentation and additional special features; The other disk offers the film in full screen presentation.

1150315,AQ2UN38CMK119,B0015OKWKS,P. Mann,"[1, 1]","The plot of Last Chance Harvey is standard. An American (Hoffman) travels to England for the marriage of his daughter. Meanwhile, a Brit (Thompson) struggles to find a personal life despite the constant presence of her mother (who believes that her neighbor might be a serial killer). As the film begins, Harvey's life is a mess. His career composing commercial jingles seems to be on its last legs, and his relationship to his daughter is strained. In fact, she tells him that she wants her stepfather to give her away at the wedding.Kate Walker (Emma Thompson) goes on a blind date only to have her mother call constantly, though that fact seems less salient than the fact that her date just doesn't go well. She has, more or less, given up on love. The two meet once when Harvey arrives in England and Kate tries to get him to take a survey at the airport, pass briefly in a scene reminiscent ofYou've Got Mailor a dozen other romantic comedies, and the meet again at the airport when Harvey's flight is (of course) delayed.The film is, as I noted, completely predictable. If it were only a script, I'd recommend skipping it or, at most, reading ten pages and then inferring the rest. But films are more than their scripts, and here the film is saved by its two stars. Neither performance is great or groundbreaking, but there is truth in them, enough to make me enjoy watching the actors and forget about the predictability and implausibility. I should, I think, add one note about the implausibility.When a daughter decides to have her stepfather give her away at her wedding, there's probably something wrong with the relationship between the father and daughter, something that probably won't be fixed in a few days before a wedding, especially after the years during which the problem has festered. If I had stopped long to think about the plot, I'd have enjoyed the film less. But the film is more of a character study than a calculated tearjerker, and the plot difficulties did not sink the film for me.",4,Thoroughly predictable but still enjoyable,1243296000,"05 26, 2009",2009,2013,"['plot', 'Last', 'Chance', 'Harvey', 'standard', 'American', 'Hoffman', 'England', 'marriage', 'daughter', 'Meanwhile', 'Brit', 'Thompson', 'find', 'personal', 'life', 'constant', 'presence', 'mother', 'who', 'neighbor', 'might', 'be', 'serial', 'killer', 'film', 'Harvey', 'life', 'mess', 'career', 'composing', 'commercial', 'jingles', 'be', 'last', 'legs', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'strained', 'fact', 'stepfather', 'give', 'away', 'wedding.Kate', 'Walker', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'blind', 'date', 'only', 'have', 'mother', 'call', 'constantly', 'fact', 'less', 'salient', 'fact', 'date', 'just', ""n't"", 'go', 'well', 'more', 'less', 'given', 'up', 'love', 'two', 'meet', 'once', 'when', 'Harvey', 'England', 'Kate', 'tries', 'get', 'take', 'survey', 'airport', 'pass', 'briefly', 'scene', 'reminiscent', 'ofYou', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Mailor', 'dozen', 'other', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'meet', 'again', 'airport', 'when', 'Harvey', 'flight', 'course', 'delayed.The', 'film', 'noted', 'completely', 'predictable', 'were', 'only', 'script', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'skipping', 'most', 'reading', 'ten', 'pages', 'then', 'inferring', 'rest', 'films', 'are', 'more', 'scripts', 'here', 'film', 'saved', 'two', 'stars', 'performance', 'great', 'groundbreaking', 'truth', 'enough', 'make', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'actors', 'forget', 'predictability', 'implausibility', 'should', 'think', 'add', 'one', 'note', 'implausibility.When', 'daughter', 'have', 'stepfather', 'give', 'away', 'wedding', 'probably', 'something', 'wrong', 'relationship', 'father', 'daughter', 'something', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'fixed', 'few', 'days', 'wedding', 'especially', 'years', 'problem', 'festered', 'had', 'stopped', 'long', 'think', 'plot', ""'d"", 'have', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'less', 'film', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'calculated', 'tearjerker', 'plot', 'difficulties', 'did', 'not', 'sink', 'film']",Last Chance Harvey

It's also not so much a romance as it is belated coming of age story for a pair of potentially romantic characters.It's marketed as such so don't hold that against the film or its cast.Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson do a good turn here with performances that feel real, desperate, moving but not cloyingly winsome.Harvey, played very well by Hoffman, is a man at the end of his disappointing career. He had some fun with writing and performing in the jingles for commercials, but he's a musician at heart who has never felt like he was doing what he truly loved. It paid the bills.Emma is another victim of the world moving too fast to keep up. Hoping for a chance at romance she seems to always be in the wrong place and in marginal situations. Her ability to actually breakdown as she privately stifles tears is heart rending. Worse, she's a character with a personal guard so fixed into position that she'd immediately avoid a good hug, knowing a futile, even if sincere gesture when she sees one.While Hoffman's Harvey is being unmanned by his own daughter on the night before her wedding in an alienating setting, Thompson's Kate is watching her blind date unravel when opportunistic friends of her ""date"" drop in on him while she's in the loo, making her the odd person out. On top of that she has a paranoid mother calling her cell at the most inopportune moments. Kate attempts this juggling act as a loving daughter trying very hard not to dismiss her mother, taking the time to encourage her mother, but also to have a life of her own.Of course, these two meet. Eventually Harvey's jovial nature and puppy dog charm starts to win her over. Still, there's a palpable distance and they are strangers. It takes her letting her guard down and Harvey risking her utter alienation to get them on an even footing. The charm of this film is not in just the characters or the story. The setting of London as a backdrop, with all it's diverse and multi-ethnic charm and old world quality makes this the perfect place for such a budding relationship to get started. Both, in their own way, are pretty much at odds with their world but also lost within it. This allows them both an opportunity they otherwise would not have taken.I love the quiet dignity of this film set in a teaming city. It has unexpected humor and subdued charm as these two character find not only themselves, but do it through each other.It ends in hope, not in finality. In todays confusing world with it's ever shifting priorities even a toe hold in something real is enough to make a person glow with hope.",4,Solid performances in a shuffled if somewhat formulaic film,1247356800,"07 12, 2009",2009,2611,"['First', 'not', 'comedy', 'also', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'romance', 'belated', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'pair', 'potentially', 'romantic', 'characters.It', 'marketed', 'such', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'film', 'cast.Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'do', 'good', 'turn', 'here', 'performances', 'feel', 'real', 'desperate', 'moving', 'not', 'cloyingly', 'winsome.Harvey', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'Hoffman', 'man', 'end', 'disappointing', 'career', 'had', 'fun', 'writing', 'performing', 'jingles', 'commercials', 'musician', 'heart', 'who', 'never', 'felt', 'was', 'doing', 'what', 'truly', 'loved', 'paid', 'bills.Emma', 'victim', 'world', 'moving', 'too', 'fast', 'keep', 'up', 'Hoping', 'chance', 'romance', 'always', 'be', 'wrong', 'place', 'marginal', 'situations', 'ability', 'actually', 'breakdown', 'privately', 'tears', 'heart', 'rending', 'Worse', 'character', 'personal', 'guard', 'so', 'fixed', 'position', ""'d"", 'immediately', 'avoid', 'good', 'hug', 'knowing', 'futile', 'even', 'sincere', 'gesture', 'when', 'one.While', 'Hoffman', 'Harvey', 'being', 'unmanned', 'own', 'daughter', 'night', 'wedding', 'alienating', 'setting', 'Thompson', 'Kate', 'watching', 'blind', 'date', 'unravel', 'when', 'opportunistic', 'friends', 'date', 'drop', 'loo', 'making', 'odd', 'person', 'out', 'top', 'paranoid', 'mother', 'calling', 'cell', 'most', 'inopportune', 'moments', 'Kate', 'juggling', 'act', 'loving', 'daughter', 'trying', 'very', 'hard', 'not', 'dismiss', 'mother', 'taking', 'time', 'encourage', 'mother', 'also', 'have', 'life', 'own.Of', 'course', 'two', 'meet', 'Eventually', 'Harvey', 'jovial', 'nature', 'puppy', 'dog', 'charm', 'win', 'over', 'Still', 'palpable', 'distance', 'are', 'strangers', 'letting', 'guard', 'Harvey', 'risking', 'utter', 'alienation', 'get', 'even', 'footing', 'charm', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'characters', 'story', 'setting', 'London', 'backdrop', 'diverse', 'multi-ethnic', 'charm', 'old', 'world', 'quality', 'perfect', 'place', 'budding', 'relationship', 'get', 'started', 'own', 'way', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'odds', 'world', 'also', 'lost', 'opportunity', 'otherwise', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'taken.I', 'quiet', 'dignity', 'film', 'set', 'teaming', 'city', 'unexpected', 'humor', 'subdued', 'charm', 'two', 'character', 'find', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'other.It', 'hope', 'not', 'finality', 'todays', 'confusing', 'world', 'ever', 'shifting', 'priorities', 'even', 'toe', 'hold', 'something', 'real', 'enough', 'make', 'person', 'glow', 'hope']",Last Chance Harvey

Harvey Shine (Dustin Hoffman) is about to lose his job in advertising to a younger hand,  he's also about to lose his daughter Susan (Liane Balaban) to her new husband, and he's getting close to losing himself as well.It's kismet that he meets Kate Walker (Emma Thompson) a British woman in similar circumstances.  And it's literally his third chance to do so that he recognizes her.They strike up a friendship despite their mutual angst and Kate helps Harvey by attending Susan's wedding reception.  This is the story that the film's trying to tell. I honestly can't say why they didn't quite score a hit with it. I love both Thompson and Hoffman and I wanted to like this pairing, but nothing about the two of them together really made me think they were a couple at all.  Perhaps if they played this as more of a British comedy than an American and created more tension between the two of them, it might have worked better.The subplot, Kate's senior Mom (Eileen Atkins) who drives Kate crazy by calling dozens of times a day, had me riveted to the screen each time she came on. This woman's obsession with her new Polish neighbor who she watches out her back window is fascinating. The Easter Egg at the end of the credits showing the two of them finally meeting was worth sitting through hte whole film listening to the two senior guys behind me snoring.

1150324,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B0015OKWKS,Robert Morris,"[27, 29]","By no means do I damn with faint praise when suggesting that this is a ""small"" film. Rather, only to suggest that it covers a brief period of time (a few days), in a single setting (London), focuses primarily on only two characters, and there few plot developments. Briefly, Harvey Shine (Dustin Hoffman) is employed by an advertising agency in Manhattan as a jingle writer when we are introduced to him. Almost immediately we sense that he is dissatisfied with both his career (he would prefer to earn a living as a jazz composer and performer) and with the current state of his life (he is divorced and apparently alienated from his adult daughter, Susan, who is about to be married in London). The title refers to both situations: Charley is advised by his boss Marvin (Richard Schiff who played the character Toby Ziegler on the television program, The West Wing) that his job is in jeopardy. After a very brief encounter upon arrival at Heathrow Airport with Kate Walker (Emma Thompson) seeking to obtain travel information from passengers, Harvey is saddened to learn from Susan (Liane Balaban) that she has decided that her stepfather Brian (James Brolin) will accompany her down the aisle. Of course, Harvey encounters Kate again and then....The acting is outstanding. The setting is especially appropriate for what happens to a troubled New Yorker, among strangers in a strange city, at a time when he is running out of options in all areas of his life. Kate has concerns of her own but seems less troubled, probably because she fulfills at least some needs by comforting and reassuring her mother Maggie Walker (Eileen Atkins) who calls her constantly throughout the day (and evening), concerned about trivial matters. We know almost nothing else about Kate's private life, other than the absence of romance and few (if any) chances of finding it. She clearly does not wish to be hurt and is sensibly reluctant to become involved with anyone, even a stranger who is clearly unhappy, feels rejected, and in need of attention and kindness.Five Star ratings of films should be reserved for ""classics"" and that is especially true of romantic comedies such as It Happened One Night, Little Shop Around the Corner, Sleepless in Seattle, and You've Got Mail.

1150326,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0015OKWKS,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 8]","**1/2Like the far superior ""Something's Gotta Give,"" Joel Hopkins` ""Last Chance Harvey"" is that rare movie romance in which the main characters have less time ahead of them than they have behind them.  This means that they come loaded down with far more serious baggage than their whippersnapper counterparts in most such stories.Harvey's burden is that he's a songwriter who's pretty much hit the bottom-of-the-barrel in his professional life - he writes jingles for television commercials - and who's long since given up his dream of ever becoming a world-class jazz pianist.  He's also a failure as a parent, finding himself all but estranged from his twenty-something daughter who so prefers her stepfather to her real father that she's chosen the former to walk her down the aisle at her wedding.  Kate is an employee at Heathrow Airport who spends most of her free time taking care of her high maintenance aging mother and being roped into going on pathetic blind dates that invariably leave her feeling unfulfilled, crushed and vulnerable.  It is when Harvey travels to London to attend his daughter's wedding - where he is treated like a virtual outcast - that his and Kate's paths eventually cross.  Discouraged and lonely, Harvey and Kate begin a tentative friendship that promises to bloom into a full-fledged romance by the end of the picture.Since love stories centered around later-life couples are indeed such an anomaly, it becomes doubly sad to have to report that ""Last Chance Harvey"" turns out to be a decidedly innocuous, low-wattage affair overall.  Although the movie runs for a scant ninety minutes, literally a full half hour passes before Harvey and Kate share any real screen time together.  This means that the entire romance has to be crammed into a mere hour's worth of time, a feat that no actors - not even two of the caliber of Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson - could reasonably be expected to pull off.  The script deserves credit for not over-dramatizing its scenes and for being willing to allow the romance to unfold without a great deal of hoopla and fanfare.  But the result, paradoxically, is that this very lack of urgency and energy winds up draining much of the life out of the film.Lucky for us, we do have two old pros like Hoffman and Thompson to make the movie seem better than it is - though it's a bit farfetched to try to pass the lovely and witty Thompson off as a woman who can't land herself a man.  It's also a bit unfortunate that the final scenes begin to seem like ""The Graduate: Forty Years Later,"" as a now much older Hoffman races around the city trying to get himself back in the good graces of the woman he loves.Hoffman and Thompson make for an inspired pairing, but beyond their performances, ""Last Chance Harvey"" evaporates from memory not too long after we've seen it.",2,the stars outshine their material,1233100800,"01 28, 2009",2009,2834,"['far', 'superior', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'Joel', 'Hopkins', 'Last', 'Chance', 'Harvey', 'rare', 'movie', 'romance', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'less', 'time', 'ahead', 'have', 'come', 'loaded', 'down', 'far', 'more', 'serious', 'baggage', 'whippersnapper', 'counterparts', 'most', 'such', 'stories.Harvey', 'burden', 'songwriter', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'hit', 'bottom-of-the-barrel', 'professional', 'life', 'jingles', 'television', 'commercials', 'who', 'long', 'given', 'up', 'dream', 'ever', 'becoming', 'world-class', 'jazz', 'pianist', 'also', 'failure', 'parent', 'finding', 'estranged', 'twenty-something', 'daughter', 'who', 'so', 'stepfather', 'real', 'father', 'chosen', 'former', 'walk', 'down', 'aisle', 'wedding', 'Kate', 'employee', 'Heathrow', 'Airport', 'who', 'most', 'free', 'time', 'taking', 'care', 'high', 'maintenance', 'aging', 'mother', 'being', 'roped', 'going', 'pathetic', 'blind', 'dates', 'invariably', 'leave', 'feeling', 'unfulfilled', 'crushed', 'vulnerable', 'when', 'Harvey', 'London', 'attend', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'where', 'treated', 'virtual', 'outcast', 'Kate', 'paths', 'eventually', 'cross', 'Discouraged', 'lonely', 'Harvey', 'Kate', 'begin', 'tentative', 'friendship', 'bloom', 'full-fledged', 'romance', 'end', 'picture.Since', 'love', 'stories', 'centered', 'later-life', 'couples', 'are', 'indeed', 'such', 'anomaly', 'doubly', 'sad', 'have', 'report', 'Last', 'Chance', 'Harvey', 'out', 'be', 'decidedly', 'innocuous', 'low-wattage', 'affair', 'overall', 'movie', 'scant', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'literally', 'full', 'half', 'hour', 'passes', 'Harvey', 'Kate', 'share', 'real', 'screen', 'time', 'together', 'entire', 'romance', 'be', 'crammed', 'mere', 'hour', 'worth', 'time', 'feat', 'actors', 'not', 'even', 'two', 'caliber', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'could', 'reasonably', 'be', 'expected', 'pull', 'off', 'script', 'credit', 'not', 'over-dramatizing', 'scenes', 'being', 'willing', 'allow', 'romance', 'unfold', 'great', 'deal', 'hoopla', 'fanfare', 'result', 'paradoxically', 'very', 'lack', 'urgency', 'energy', 'winds', 'up', 'draining', 'much', 'life', 'film.Lucky', 'do', 'have', 'two', 'old', 'pros', 'Hoffman', 'Thompson', 'make', 'movie', 'seem', 'better', 'bit', 'farfetched', 'try', 'pass', 'lovely', 'witty', 'Thompson', 'off', 'woman', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'land', 'man', 'also', 'bit', 'unfortunate', 'final', 'scenes', 'begin', 'seem', 'Graduate', 'Forty', 'Years', 'Later', 'now', 'much', 'older', 'Hoffman', 'city', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'good', 'graces', 'woman', 'Thompson', 'make', 'inspired', 'pairing', 'performances', 'Last', 'Chance', 'Harvey', 'memory', 'not', 'too', 'long', ""'ve"", 'seen']",Last Chance Harvey

For one, the main characters are decent and likeable people; sure they've got flaws, and they've fallen into self-defeating habits in life, but part of the beauty of the movie is how they lift themselves out of self-defeat and even at this point in their lives (middle to late middle aged) find love and contentedness with each other.  The characters inspire each other and gently tug each other out of their loneliness and quiet misery.I liked the tone and pace of the movie too - the gentle humor, the glimpses we get of England, the chemistry between the characters, who aren't ravishingly beautiful or handsome, but have such lovely smiles, warm eyes, and good chemistry with each other.  As Kate Walker and Harvey Shine, Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman work well together, and the scenes where they're on camera together have a special light of their own.The subplot with Kate's mother (and the mysterious, slightly sinister new neighbor) was a bit too silly and thin, but I did enjoy the part of the movie that dealt with Harvey's relationship with his daughter (and I admit there's one part when I was moved to tears, in a moment when he finally stands up and asserts himself as a father - doing this with grace and genuine feeling, and without rancor at his ex-wife or her husband).  I liked this - that you can have a movie without a real villain, only ordinary people messing up and then trying to repair their mistakes and find some love, closeness and peace in life.",4,sweet decent movie,1286841600,"10 12, 2010",2010,1534,"['enjoyed', 'Last', 'Chance', 'Harvey', 'number', 'reasons', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'decent', 'likeable', 'people', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'got', 'flaws', ""'ve"", 'fallen', 'self-defeating', 'habits', 'life', 'part', 'beauty', 'movie', 'how', 'lift', 'self-defeat', 'even', 'point', 'lives', 'middle', 'late', 'middle', 'aged', 'find', 'love', 'contentedness', 'other', 'characters', 'inspire', 'other', 'gently', 'tug', 'other', 'loneliness', 'quiet', 'misery.I', 'liked', 'tone', 'pace', 'movie', 'too', 'gentle', 'humor', 'glimpses', 'get', 'England', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'ravishingly', 'beautiful', 'handsome', 'have', 'such', 'lovely', 'smiles', 'warm', 'eyes', 'good', 'chemistry', 'other', 'Kate', 'Walker', 'Harvey', 'Shine', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'work', 'well', 'together', 'scenes', 'where', ""'re"", 'camera', 'together', 'have', 'special', 'light', 'own.The', 'subplot', 'Kate', 'mother', 'mysterious', 'slightly', 'sinister', 'new', 'neighbor', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'silly', 'thin', 'did', 'enjoy', 'part', 'movie', 'dealt', 'Harvey', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'admit', 'one', 'part', 'when', 'was', 'moved', 'tears', 'moment', 'when', 'finally', 'up', 'father', 'doing', 'grace', 'genuine', 'feeling', 'rancor', 'ex-wife', 'husband', 'liked', 'can', 'have', 'movie', 'real', 'villain', 'only', 'ordinary', 'people', 'messing', 'up', 'then', 'trying', 'repair', 'mistakes', 'find', 'love', 'closeness', 'peace', 'life']",Last Chance Harvey

It was a nice little film perfect for snuggling on the couch with a big bowl of popcorn and relaxing with before bed.  It had just enough romance and heartache to interest the girls and enough laughs to keep the guys awake.It is as someone said previously very formulaic.  I guessed what was going to happen in one scene before it did (read too many screenwriter books dear?) and completely astonished my spouse and son with my prescient announcement of the plot point that would impact the relationship of the charming couple.Harvey is a jingle writer in New York who is so busy in the advertising business that he is anxious about leaving for London for his daughter's wedding.  Kate is a lonely manager of a group of Marketers at Heathrow airport interviewing travelers as they arrive (I did this at Graceland once for a few extra bucks it isn't fun).  The two meet incidentally as a harried Harvey arrives and Kate is rebuffed by him.Harvey arrives and finds his ex wife has hidden him off far away for he is somewhat of a selfish boor.  He meets his daughter and we can tell he loves her but seems to put business first.  After a series of embarrassments he decides he will leave right after the wedding.Kate lives alone and is constantly harassed by her mother who needs a lot of attention (there is a comic subplot between the mom and a neighbor) and is constantly fixed up with blind dates by her coworkers.  She is very lonely but afraid of being hurt.The two meet in the airport bar when Harvey misses his flight back to New York and will have to spend another day in the UK.  They strike up a conversation and find a mutual respect for one another.  Harvey too is lonely and depressed and decides to spend the day with her.The rest of the story is fairly predictable yet I believe you will enjoy how Kate helps Harvey reconcile with his family and his dreams and how Harvey helps Kate overcome her loneliness and fears.,4,A Nice Little Film to Snuggle To,1242691200,"05 19, 2009",2009,2037,"['love', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'see', 'quirky', 'romance', 'together', 'was', 'nice', 'little', 'film', 'perfect', 'snuggling', 'couch', 'big', 'bowl', 'popcorn', 'relaxing', 'bed', 'had', 'just', 'enough', 'romance', 'heartache', 'interest', 'girls', 'enough', 'laughs', 'keep', 'guys', 'awake.It', 'someone', 'said', 'previously', 'very', 'formulaic', 'guessed', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'one', 'scene', 'did', 'read', 'too', 'many', 'screenwriter', 'books', 'dear', 'completely', 'astonished', 'spouse', 'son', 'prescient', 'announcement', 'plot', 'point', 'would', 'impact', 'relationship', 'charming', 'couple.Harvey', 'jingle', 'writer', 'New', 'York', 'who', 'so', 'busy', 'advertising', 'business', 'anxious', 'leaving', 'London', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'Kate', 'lonely', 'manager', 'group', 'Marketers', 'Heathrow', 'airport', 'interviewing', 'travelers', 'arrive', 'did', 'Graceland', 'once', 'few', 'extra', 'bucks', ""n't"", 'fun', 'two', 'meet', 'incidentally', 'harried', 'Harvey', 'arrives', 'Kate', 'rebuffed', 'him.Harvey', 'arrives', 'ex', 'wife', 'hidden', 'off', 'far', 'away', 'somewhat', 'selfish', 'boor', 'daughter', 'can', 'tell', 'put', 'business', 'first', 'series', 'embarrassments', 'will', 'leave', 'right', 'wedding.Kate', 'alone', 'constantly', 'harassed', 'mother', 'who', 'lot', 'attention', 'comic', 'subplot', 'mom', 'neighbor', 'constantly', 'fixed', 'up', 'blind', 'dates', 'coworkers', 'very', 'lonely', 'afraid', 'being', 'hurt.The', 'two', 'meet', 'airport', 'bar', 'when', 'Harvey', 'flight', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'will', 'have', 'spend', 'day', 'UK', 'strike', 'up', 'conversation', 'find', 'mutual', 'respect', 'one', 'Harvey', 'too', 'lonely', 'depressed', 'spend', 'day', 'her.The', 'rest', 'story', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'yet', 'believe', 'will', 'enjoy', 'how', 'Kate', 'Harvey', 'reconcile', 'family', 'dreams', 'how', 'Harvey', 'Kate', 'loneliness', 'fears']",Last Chance Harvey

1150333,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B0015OKWKS,Steve,"[1, 1]","Last Chance Harvey was a movie that was equal parts uncomfortable and sad as well as uplifting and hopeful. The beginning was very difficult to watch as we are introduced to the main characters via their painfully dull, lonely, and self-defeating lives. Kate is a poll taker in an airport and Harvey is a jingle writer fighting for his job. Single, lonely, and socially inept, these two happen to run into each other through the circumstances of plot and the movie begins to finally pick up.If fact, the movie seems to bottom out just before it picks up, exactly as the lives of these characters do. I was close to stopping it, I'll be very honest. Watching Dustin Hoffman's Harvey play out his schleppy downtrodden life was cringing. Thompson's Kate is a bit less grating, but either way, the director goes to great lengths to let you know that these are two thoroughly defeated people.After their second meeting, the two strike up a relationship and therein the movie begins the redemptive part. There was genuine warmth and a sense of hope finally blooming for these two sad people. I felt the ending was tacked on, however, and that the movie could've ended ten or fifteen minutes earlier without the forced tension and syrupy ending, but that's Hollywood.Last Chance Harvey has some very good observations about marginalized dads in divorce that spoke to me with bitter honesty. Furthermore, there are salient points about remorse over life choices, as well as how easy it seems to retreat to our miserable world for the sheer but sad comfort of it. Using older people was necessary as credulity would've been strained otherwise. I had to believe that these two people had fallen so far below the radar that getting back into life would seem uncomfortable and difficult.While not perfect, this movie was good enough to certainly rent and then see about purchasing it from there.

Harvey Shine (Hoffman) is a 60-something jingle writer who always wanted to be a jazz pianist, but was never good enough.  He may have seen some success in the past, but his career is waning.  His marriage ended long ago, and it's clear he's not close to his daughter.  Nonetheless, he's flying to London for her wedding.  There Harvey encounters Kate Walker (Thompson) a lonely, 40-something woman who spends entirely too much time on the phone with her elderly mother.  She has close friendships and enriches her life with books and writing classes, but none of that makes up for what's missing.  An unlikely couple, when Kate and Harvey come together, they're greater than the sum of their parts.And in the hands of Hoffman and Thompson, these characters couldn't be more believable, sympathetic, or true to life.  I defy you to watch the wedding toast without tearing up.  Last Chance Harvey isn't a big or flashy film, but it's smart and entertaining.  It's also given a nice DVD presentation, with a 16:30 making of featurette, and an above average commentary featuring writer/director Joel Hopkins, Emma Thompson, and Dustin Hoffman.  So often actor commentaries can be vacuous, but in the hands of these masters there were real insights into character and craft.  Overall, this film and its bonus features are highly recommended.",5,I would watch Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson read the phone book...,1245283200,"06 18, 2009",2009,1749,"['Fortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'two', 'brilliant', 'actors', 'star', 'Last', 'Chance', 'Harvey', 'delightfully', 'adult', 'drama', 'was', 'describing', 'film', 'friend', 'recently', 'told', 'not', 'comedy', 'really', 'funny', 'real', 'life', 'sort', 'sums', 'film', 'up', 'far', 'more', 'like', 'real', 'life', 'usually', 'see', 'big', 'screen.The', 'story', 'character', 'study', 'two', 'very', 'real', 'people', 'Harvey', 'Shine', 'Hoffman', '60-something', 'jingle', 'writer', 'who', 'always', 'wanted', 'be', 'jazz', 'pianist', 'was', 'never', 'good', 'enough', 'may', 'have', 'seen', 'success', 'past', 'career', 'waning', 'marriage', 'ended', 'long', 'ago', 'clear', 'not', 'close', 'daughter', 'Nonetheless', 'flying', 'London', 'wedding', 'Harvey', 'encounters', 'Kate', 'Walker', 'Thompson', 'lonely', '40-something', 'woman', 'who', 'entirely', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'phone', 'elderly', 'mother', 'close', 'friendships', 'life', 'books', 'writing', 'classes', 'none', 'up', 'what', 'missing', 'unlikely', 'couple', 'when', 'Kate', 'Harvey', 'come', 'together', ""'re"", 'greater', 'sum', 'parts.And', 'hands', 'Hoffman', 'Thompson', 'characters', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'believable', 'sympathetic', 'true', 'life', 'defy', 'watch', 'wedding', 'toast', 'tearing', 'up', 'Last', 'Chance', 'Harvey', ""n't"", 'big', 'flashy', 'film', 'smart', 'entertaining', 'also', 'given', 'nice', 'DVD', 'presentation', '16:30', 'making', 'featurette', 'above', 'average', 'commentary', 'featuring', 'writer/director', 'Joel', 'Hopkins', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'So', 'often', 'actor', 'commentaries', 'can', 'be', 'vacuous', 'hands', 'masters', 'were', 'real', 'insights', 'character', 'craft', 'Overall', 'film', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'highly', 'recommended']",Last Chance Harvey

1150338,A25QJBK33C4O0R,B0015OKWKS,"terpfan1980 ""Barry""","[0, 0]","I seem to be on a bit of a romantic comedy streak lately, with another recent film viewing (and review) being the somewhat more silly and definitely younger (compared to this film) skewing film New In Town having been watched only a few days before watching this film.  Other than both being romantic comedies, there's really not much in common between that title and this one.Last Chance Harvey was clearly aimed at providing a vehicle for a couple of actors a bit more long in the tooth, with the still somewhat boyishly looking Dustin Hoffman pairing up with Emma Thompson.  I note somewhat boyishly because if you research Hoffman's real age you may find it somewhat unbelievable that the young fellow that starred in The Graduate so long ago is as old as he really is (born in 1937).  Emma Thompson could easily be Hoffman's daughter given the differences in their ages (she was born in 1959), but that would be a different movie entirely (like say the movie Rumor Has It with Jennifer Aniston) and in reality Thompson stands well enough above Hoffman that you'd have to wonder a bit just who her mother would have had to be.Despite those age differences, both work well enough for their roles here, as does a snow white haired James Brolin in a small part as the second husband of Harvey's (Hoffman) ex-wife.  Brolin is supposed to be an older gentleman compared to the younger Hoffman, even though Brolin is actually approx. 3 years younger than Hoffman.  With the white hair, Brolin certainly looks the part.The basic premise of the story is that Harvey Shine is at a bit of a crossroads in his life.  He composes and plays music for commercial jingles.  His daughter (an American) is about to marry another American citizen, but the marriage is to take place in London (where both happen to be) so Harvey must travel even as he has a big deal in the works, perhaps a career breaking deal.  His boss tries to push Harvey to take plenty of time to attend the wedding signaling to Harvey that he's being pushed out of his job, even though he's sure he can still do it and still make the deal.  So, off Harvey goes to attend his estranged daughter's wedding, where he'll wind up (thanks to the writers and perhaps the alignment of the stars) crossing paths with Kate Walker (Thompson) a government employee (survey taker) in London.In many ways this story is somewhat reminiscent of Lost in Translation, and honestly, in some ways I think the role of Harvey could easily have been filled by Bill Murray (who is a good bit closer to Thompson's age).  That said, I can't complain about Hoffman's performance here, though I wonder if I'd be more 'shocked' by the difference in the actors ages if I were to have seen this on high definition (Blu-ray) as opposed to standard definition DVD.  Regardless, the comparison to Lost in Translation is probably a pretty good one as both are pretty decent examples of character studies.Honestly, this isn't really a traditional romantic comedy.  It's more serious, more mature, and realistically is a character study that happens to include some comedic elements than it is anything close to a romantic comedy.  There's not much silliness, and if one can overlook the contrivance of having both of the stars cross paths and form a strong bond in a short period of time, it doesn't really contain enough contrivances to qualify in the rom-com category.I mention Blu-ray above and noted that I viewed this one on DVD (and not Blu-ray).  That's somewhat unusual for me, but in this case I had the DVD available, so that's what I viewed.  Surprisingly the DVD picture quality was pretty nice, while there were background images that weren't as sharp as I'd expect the Blu-ray would offer, the shots of the actors looked very nice.  That said, I wonder if perhaps those same shots would have shown more of Hoffman's age if viewed in high definition.One thing that my wife and I did notice and which nagged at us a bit, as the film progresses along and Harvey and Kate begin to bond they take a bit of a journey around London that would seem to have occupied a considerable amount of time, yet, somehow, as if by magic they are able to arrive at another event at a key time.  How the day wasn't already fairly well exhausted and how they could get across town in time seems to be a point that we aren't supposed to notice or question.  Other than that though, the film seemed to just fine.Last Chance Harvey was a decent film, and I might peg it at the 3-1/2 star level if offered the choice of using half stars here.  There's really nothing objectionable about it, and honestly it's somewhat difficult to give any real reason why I couldn't give the film 4 or even 5 stars other than just the feeling that while it's a good film it's not a great film and because of that falls back into the mid-range for me.Is this one a purchase rather than rental material?  I'd have to say it's borderline.  For some it would make a great purchase, for others, probably not so much.  If possible rent first and then buy yourself a copy after you determine it's something you'd like to watch repeatedly, or perhaps buy a copy for friends and family that you think would enjoy it.",3,"A

1150340,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B0015OKWKS,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[2, 3]","I must confess I am not biggest fan of romantic comedies in the realm of cinema.  This is mainly due to the fact that in the past ten years (I feel) that romantic comedies all follow the same stereotypical formula:- Young guy meets young girl.- Both guy & girl are very superficial (to some degree).- Both guy & girl are very materialistic (to some degree).- Both guy & girl cannot act.- The comedy is grossly pratfalls & physical jesting.- In addition the comedy is crude humor limited by a PG-13 rating.- With 15 to 20 minutes left in the movie there is an arbitrary ""conflict"".- The conflict is resolved in an unbelievable and/or empathizing manner.- Guy and girl reconcile but still retain their superficial/materialistic ethos.I am happy to say that ""Last Chance Harvey"" is none of the above.  It was a movie unlike any I have seen in a long time. Dare I say a neo-vintage romance film?Harvey (Dustin Hoffman) is traveling to London in order to attend his only daughter's wedding.  It appears that over the years Harvey has become the outcast of the family.  This is evident by his daughter's request to have her step-father give her away rather than having her real father, Harvey, to perform this duty.  To add insult to injury, Harvey has also lost his job as a composer for music used in TV ads.Meanwhile Kate (Emma Thompson) is a resident of London and works in an airport.  Kate also is living the single life, but is semi-hopeful she might meet somebody.  In addition, her mother is constantly irking Kate about myriad things.  These things are but not limited to Kate's love life and a supposed ""serial killer"" living next door.  Needless to say Kate has become tired of the humdrum routine.It isn't any big shock to figure out what happens next, when Harvey meets Kate.  I sort of knew this going into the movie, so it didn't bother me.  What makes this movie magically is the chemistry between Thompson and Hoffman.  This chemistry is what makes the inevitable so enduring.  Another thing interesting about this movie is it isn't a ""romantic comedy"".  Rather it is just a throwback to those romantic films of the 1950/60s.  This movie has some funny moments, but by no means is comedy.  Also it is really refreshing to see a movie about love and relationships that doesn't focus on model-esque twenty something guys and gals.The DVD comes with both a widescreen and full screen version of the movie.  I watched the former and I am glad I did.  ""Last Chance Harvey"" shows amazing cinematography of London, as well as some interesting camera angles.  I feel these would be lost in the full screen version of the film.  Which is funny because I normally wouldn't think this is a movie that needs to be viewed in letterbox.  There are also some trailers/previews on the DVD, as well as a featurette about the making of the movie.If you are in the mood for romance that is subtle, bitter-sweet, enchanting and human, than ""Last Chance Harvey"" is the movie for you.  My first response to watching this movie was that it wouldn't be any good.

Fearful he is about to lose his job, he rushes to the airport to catch a plane to London; his daughter is getting married to her fianc&eacute;e and he can't miss the wedding, his relationship with his daughter is already strained to the point of bursting. When he arrives, he realizes he has been relegated to 'Guest' status and his cell phone continues to ring at inopportune times. But the real blow comes when his daughter announces her step-dad (James Brolin) will give her away. Harvey can't stand it and leaves the wedding before the reception. Returning to Heathrow to miss his flight, he sits down in an airport bar and finds Kate (Emma Thompson), an airport employee enjoying a glass of wine, her nose buried in a new paperback. They strike up a reluctant conversation and Harvey is intrigued. It takes a while, but Kate is just as intrigued and they start to talk and walk around London.""Last Chance Harvey"", written and directed by Joel Hopkins, is a charming romance, a good showcase for the talents of the two leads and a very, very imperfect film saved only by Hoffman and Thompson. Ultimately, it is a nice little bit of fluff that you will no doubt forget. You'll have one of those conversations in a few months. ""Did you see that film with Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson?"" ""No, which one? ""Love, Actually""?"" ""No, Hoffman wasn't in that. The other one.""The saving grace of the film are the performances from Hoffman and Thompson. I read that both insisted there be limited rehearsals, allowing for the characters to improvise and seem even more natural. Hoffman plays Harvey, a real mess of a guy who is about to lose his job and his daughter and makes a real botched effort trying to save his relationship with both. He rushes to London for her wedding, making the return flight for two days later. When he tells his daughter he will miss the reception, it seems to be the final straw and she drops a bombshell on him. Her step-dad will give her away. When she tells Harvey this, you can tell she is heartbroken because her relationship with her dad is so strained. When he hears the news, you can almost see Harvey's heart break, as Hoffman's face registers a wave of emotion, the feelings briefly flashing across his face.As soon as the wedding is over, he bolts, rushing back to Heathrow, but he also seems relieved to be away from the crushing emotional memories. When he realizes he has missed his flight, he finds himself in a weird purgatory; he can't do anything about his job and doesn't feel like doing anything about his daughter and the disconnect from her life. He slumps into an airport bar and orders a drink. Airport employee Kate (Emma Thompson) is enjoying a meal after her shift and the two begin talking. Kate, younger than Harvey, is intrigued by the American and he offers to walk with her to her next appointment.Let's backtrack a bit and look at Kate's life for a few moments. She works at Heathrow, managing a group of women who greet incoming passengers and get statistical information for them. Each of the women she works with desperately wants her to find a companion, so much so that one of them asks her to go out on a blind date. She and her boyfriend will be there, so she doesn't have anything to worry about. But Kate's life, and her love life in particular, are hampered by her mom (Eileen Atkins), a needy single woman who seems to have her finger poised above speed dial at all times. She calls Kate constantly and interrupts many conversations she has with others, including potential mates. The blind date doesn't go well and Kate becomes particularly unhappy. But she puts on a stiff upper lip and goes to work and continues to deal with her mom, bottling up her emotions and pushing on.What makes this work, and elevates the material above television movie status, are the performances from the two leads. Both Hoffman and Thompson are such good actors that when they receive material like this, they know how to make every moment seem real and believable. Hoffman really seems to lose himself inn the role and we see fifty years of Harvey's life factor into every conversation and decision he has and makes throughout the film. When he arrives in London and takes a taxi to the hotel, he calls his daughter. ""Where are all of you?"" ""Oh. Your mom rented a house."" ""No, I'm OK. I'll be fine here."" We don't need to hear the other side of the conversation to see all of the pain and conflict Harvey experiences or to understand the thoughts racing through his head as he tries to make his daughter feel OK. Why couldn't your mom put her feelings aside for a few days and include me in this momentous part of your life? Why couldn't you say something about it? But I love you too much to make a fuss and will stay put here at the hotel.In every scene, Hoffman does similar things with Harvey, revealing new things about him, his relationship with his ex and his daughter, about his life. Each of these revelations is revealed through facial expressions, or the lack of, brief little looks, his eyes, and body language. What is really interesting about this character is that Hoffman reveals so much by contradicting what Harvey is saying with little movements, or ticks, or gestures that tell us he is trying to make everyone else feel OK and he doesn't care about his feelings and wants his daughter to think everything is OK.Thompson is Hoffman's equal and she brings as much depth and interest to her character, Kate. We get the sense there is great pain in Kate because her ever present smile seems greatly strained, ready to plaster a smile across her face to keep her mom from asking too many questions and to keep her co-workers and friends from getting too involved in her life.When Kate and Harvey meet, each seems to loosen a little bit and Kate's defenses seem to crumble. She is intrigued by the forward American and agrees to walk with him. Each time she tries to pull away, he insists that they continue walking or talking and she gives in. What makes this so poignant is that she doesn't really put up a fight. She is merely protesting for appearances sake.As they walk and talk, Kate learns a lot about Harvey, and vice versa, and what brought him to this stage. She asks ""Is the reception still going on?"" And he immediately decides to ask her to go. As they spend more and more time together, they realize the unconventional aspects of their relationship, everything that should make it not work, are the reasons they are each intrigued by the budding relationship.It is really a delight to watch two actors, each so accomplished in their craft, at the top of their skills, create two people who are so intrigued by one another.There is a subplot involving Kate's mom (Eileen Atkins), which seems wasted. She is a big part of Kate's life and calls her on a constant basis. Then, she begins to have suspicions about a new neighbor. These moments seem to point to a fairly funny subplot. When that part of the story fails to payoff, you have to wonder what was the point in investing so much time in this character. It seems misleading somehow.And the film has a very small scope. This isn't a bad thing, in and of itself, but when you begin to experience the depth of Hoffman and Thompson's performances, you begin to hope for more. Eileen Atkins' character promises something funny, but when this fails to materialize, what else is there? Because so much of the film concentrates on the two characters, it begins to feel like a film adapted from a play. We have seen films adapted from plays before. Some seem better than the play because they take advantage of the new medium, film, and present a story more expansive than the original material. And others seem too restricted by the source material, presenting many dialogues between two or three characters, never leaving the confines of a 'stage'. When a film that wasn't based on a play seems like it was, that is a problem.And this problem makes the otherwise enjoyable ""Last Chance Harvey"" problematic.",4,3 1/2 - Charming and

Set in London, the slow-paced story is about Harvey Shine, a work-a-holic distanced from his only daughter.  He flies to England for her wedding, feeling like an outsider when told that her stepfather will be giving her away instead of him; of course, her decision could have been based on Harvey telling her that he didn't plan to stay for the reception.  He strikes up a romance with Kate Walker, who works for the airline, after they have lunch together discussing who has had the worst day.This movie is a love story that focuses on the heart, not mushy smutty crapola.

1150343,A3CG6YLYZJXQG4,B0015OKWKS,"Tracy Rowan ""dargelos""","[3, 3]","Harvey and Kate both wear their disappointments on their faces.  Not intentionally, of course, but because the years of disappointment have taken their toll.  For Harvey, it's losing the things he had, for Kate, it's never having had the things she wanted.  They manage.  They live their lives.  And when they meet, they seem to understand each other instinctively.In the hands of two less capable actors, the characters of Harvey and Kate would have been cliches, but Hoffman and Thompson are such pros, that you suffer with them through embarrassing and painful moments like Harvey's daughter telling him she wants her stepfather to give her away at her wedding, or Kate on a blind date being overwhelmed by a group of people who she doesn't know and with whom she has nothing in common.  Thompson's face, her body language, even the expression in her eyes was so familiar to anyone who has found themselves feeling like the odd person out.  Hoffman truly becomes the man who is so battered by bad luck and bad choices that the look in his eyes says that he's nearly been crushed by life.  His walk is a shuffle, and there is an air of bewilderment about him as if he can't quite figure out where and how he went wrong.And yet somehow these people, who are not so much wounded as just lost and alone, manage to meet and connect in a way so profound that though neither truly believes in the magic of love, they both allow themselves to be driven by the hope of it.  They truly seem to like each other, and perhaps the recognition that this is the best and most reliable basis for any relationship is what makes them take that leap of faith.The film, in fact, revolves around the idea of connections.  Harvey's job hinges on being able to connect with clients, Kate's mother is obsessed with her new next-door neighbor, Harvey's daughter is getting married and Harvey has just one last chance to connect with her and her new husband in some meaningful way.  It's a very human film and a humane one because no one is the butt of jokes or easy humor.  They're all just trying very hard to connect.One of the things I loved about the film is that everyone in it looks like a real person, like someone you'd meet on the street.  They're dressed that way, too.  There's no glam to the cast, no toothpaste ad smiles or designer duds, no makeup to make you wonder why a stunner like Thompson can't seem to find her man.  The women in the background are real-looking women in all shapes and sizes.  They're dressed like normal people and they live like normal people, not in fancy homes which make you wonder how on earth they can afford such upscale real estate.  This is a film the audience can connect with too.",4,Real people,1243382400,"05 27, 2009",2009,2707,"['Harvey', 'Kate', 'wear', 'disappointments', 'Not', 'intentionally', 'course', 'years', 'disappointment', 'have', 'taken', 'toll', 'Harvey', 'losing', 'things', 'had', 'Kate', 'never', 'having', 'had', 'things', 'wanted', 'manage', 'live', 'lives', 'when', 'meet', 'seem', 'understand', 'other', 'instinctively.In', 'hands', 'two', 'less', 'capable', 'actors', 'characters', 'Harvey', 'Kate', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'cliches', 'Hoffman', 'Thompson', 'are', 'such', 'pros', 'suffer', 'embarrassing', 'painful', 'moments', 'Harvey', 'daughter', 'telling', 'stepfather', 'give', 'away', 'wedding', 'Kate', 'blind', 'date', 'being', 'overwhelmed', 'group', 'people', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'whom', 'nothing', 'common', 'Thompson', 'face', 'body', 'language', 'even', 'expression', 'eyes', 'was', 'so', 'familiar', 'anyone', 'who', 'found', 'feeling', 'odd', 'person', 'Hoffman', 'truly', 'man', 'who', 'so', 'battered', 'bad', 'luck', 'bad', 'choices', 'look', 'eyes', 'nearly', 'been', 'crushed', 'life', 'walk', 'shuffle', 'air', 'bewilderment', 'about', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'figure', 'where', 'how', 'went', 'wrong.And', 'yet', 'somehow', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'wounded', 'just', 'lost', 'alone', 'manage', 'meet', 'connect', 'way', 'so', 'profound', 'truly', 'magic', 'love', 'allow', 'be', 'driven', 'hope', 'truly', 'seem', 'like', 'other', 'perhaps', 'recognition', 'best', 'most', 'reliable', 'basis', 'relationship', 'what', 'take', 'leap', 'faith.The', 'film', 'fact', 'idea', 'connections', 'Harvey', 'job', 'hinges', 'being', 'able', 'connect', 'clients', 'Kate', 'mother', 'obsessed', 'new', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'Harvey', 'daughter', 'getting', 'married', 'Harvey', 'just', 'one', 'last', 'chance', 'connect', 'new', 'husband', 'meaningful', 'way', 'very', 'human', 'film', 'humane', 'one', 'one', 'butt', 'jokes', 'easy', 'humor', ""'re"", 'just', 'trying', 'very', 'hard', 'connect.One', 'things', 'loved', 'film', 'everyone', 'real', 'person', 'someone', ""'d"", 'meet', 'street', ""'re"", 'dressed', 'way', 'too', 'glam', 'cast', 'toothpaste', 'ad', 'smiles', 'designer', 'duds', 'makeup', 'make', 'wonder', 'why', 'stunner', 'Thompson', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'man', 'women', 'background', 'are', 'real-looking', 'women', 'shapes', 'sizes', ""'re"", 'dressed', 'normal', 'people', 'live', 'normal', 'people', 'not', 'fancy', 'homes', 'make', 'wonder', 'how', 'earth', 'can', 'afford', 'such', 'upscale', 'real', 'estate', 'film', 'audience', 'can', 'connect', 'too']",Last Chance Harvey

1150347,A3G7BEJJCPD6DS,B0015OKWKS,VeraP,"[0, 0]","Last Chance Harvey opens with Harvey Shine (Hoffman), an over-the-hill jingle writer who's about to lose his job. He's flying to London to his daughter Susan's wedding, but promises to return on time for a key meeting with a client. In London, Harvey quickly finds himself alone in a hotel while the rest of the family and guests, his estranged wife and her new husband included, rent a house in the city. He is awkward in his interactions with others, even Susan, making blunders at every turn and creating even more awkward silences. Harvey eventually works up the courage to tell Susan he will not be attending her reception in favor of flying back for the meeting, and Susan reveals that she asked her step-father to give her away at the wedding instead.Londoner Kate (played by Emma Thompson)is an airport employee, surveying people as they de-plane. She is quite close to being called an ""old maid"", and her friends set her up on uncomfortable blind dates with guys who have little interest in her. Kate's and Harvey's paths intersect in an airport bar. Harvey misses his flight and finds out that he's been fired after all; he drowns his sorrows in shots next to Kate's who's reading with a glass of wine.Harvey chats her up and they wind up spending the day together; Kate eventually convinces Harvey to attend Susan's reception, which she attends with him. Not surprisingly, Kate becomes Harvey's ""last chance"" at love and companionship, and their quirks somehow mesh together. Alone they are awkward and uncomfortable, but together they blossom.I watched the trailer for Last Chance Harvey prior to seeing the movie, and the trailer summed it all up - there were no surprises in the movie itself. Last Chance Harvey presents a nice and heartfelt story, great acting and a lot of charm. I think the movie's crowning glory was Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of Harvey Shine, and the awkwardness he exuded on screen (unless of course he is that awkward in real life, which I wouldn't know). At times, I almost squirmed at Harvey's actions - refusing to shake hands, fumbling over toasts, walking into things, etc.Last Chance Harvey was a good movie with a nice storyline, but there was nothing too memorable or worth discussing with others; it was just a way to pass the time.",4,"Honest and Touching, But No WOW Moments",1254441600,"10 2, 2009",2009,2279,"['Last', 'Chance', 'Harvey', 'Harvey', 'Shine', 'Hoffman', 'over-the-hill', 'jingle', 'writer', 'who', 'lose', 'job', 'flying', 'London', 'daughter', 'Susan', 'wedding', 'return', 'time', 'key', 'meeting', 'client', 'London', 'Harvey', 'quickly', 'alone', 'hotel', 'rest', 'family', 'guests', 'estranged', 'wife', 'new', 'husband', 'included', 'rent', 'house', 'city', 'awkward', 'interactions', 'others', 'even', 'Susan', 'making', 'blunders', 'turn', 'creating', 'even', 'more', 'awkward', 'silences', 'Harvey', 'eventually', 'up', 'courage', 'tell', 'Susan', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'attending', 'reception', 'favor', 'flying', 'back', 'meeting', 'Susan', 'reveals', 'asked', 'step-father', 'give', 'away', 'wedding', 'instead.Londoner', 'Kate', 'played', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'airport', 'employee', 'surveying', 'people', 'de-plane', 'quite', 'close', 'being', 'called', 'old', 'maid', 'friends', 'set', 'up', 'uncomfortable', 'blind', 'dates', 'guys', 'who', 'have', 'little', 'interest', 'Kate', 'Harvey', 'paths', 'intersect', 'airport', 'bar', 'Harvey', 'flight', 'out', 'been', 'fired', 'sorrows', 'shots', 'Kate', 'who', 'reading', 'glass', 'wine.Harvey', 'chats', 'up', 'wind', 'up', 'spending', 'day', 'together', 'Kate', 'eventually', 'Harvey', 'attend', 'Susan', 'reception', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'Kate', 'Harvey', 'last', 'chance', 'love', 'companionship', 'quirks', 'somehow', 'mesh', 'together', 'Alone', 'are', 'awkward', 'uncomfortable', 'together', 'blossom.I', 'watched', 'trailer', 'Last', 'Chance', 'Harvey', 'prior', 'seeing', 'movie', 'trailer', 'summed', 'up', 'were', 'surprises', 'movie', 'Last', 'Chance', 'Harvey', 'nice', 'heartfelt', 'story', 'great', 'acting', 'lot', 'charm', 'think', 'movie', 'crowning', 'glory', 'was', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'portrayal', 'Harvey', 'Shine', 'awkwardness', 'exuded', 'screen', 'course', 'awkward', 'real', 'life', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'times', 'almost', 'squirmed', 'Harvey', 'actions', 'refusing', 'shake', 'hands', 'fumbling', 'toasts', 'walking', 'things', 'etc.Last', 'Chance', 'Harvey', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'nice', 'storyline', 'was', 'nothing', 'too', 'memorable', 'worth', 'discussing', 'others', 'was', 'just', 'way', 'pass', 'time']",Last Chance Harvey
1150348,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B0015OKWKS,Westley,"[5, 6]","While visiting London for his daughter's wedding, American Harvey Shine (Dustin Hoffman) has a series of disappointments.  He realizes that he's been a bad father, which is not surprising considering that he seems more interested in his job as a commercial songwriter.  When his job starts to fall apart too, he feels as though he has one final chance to set things straight in his life.  Enter Kate Walker (Emma Thompson), a 40-something singleton who feels as though she has one final chance - in her case it's to fall in love.  Unfortunately, she's not finding it on the blind dates her caring friends set up for her.""Last Chance Harvey"" is a sweet, breezy romantic comedy.  What obviously sets it apart is the age of its leads; whereas most rom-coms feature ingenues in their 20s or early 30s (often matched with an older actor), Thompson is 49 and Hoffman is 71 years old.  Falling in love at their age, with a lifetime of prior disappointments behind them, feels risky to them.  It's not like being young and being able to abandon one's self to love.  Thompson in particular perfectly captures this sense of desperation mixed with fear of being hurt and humiliated.  She is luminous and totally believable as the star of a rom-com, although one who's been around the block a few times.  As is typical for movies, she is paired with an older actor; how interesting it would have been to have an actor closer to her age, but that's a minor quibble.The movie is filled with gentle, insightful humor.  The subplot with Thompson's xenophobic mother (Dame Eileen Atkins) was amusing but seemed disconnected from the main plot and detracted somewhat from the movie.  Otherwise, ""Last Chance Harvey"" is pitch perfect throughout.  Second-time director Joel Hopkins (""Jump Tomorrow"") wisely keeps things very simple, and the movie's relatively short run time also helps keep things interesting.  There's nothing terribly unique about ""Last Chance Harvey,"" but it's so well acted and genuine that it scores an easy bull's eye.",4,"""I'm not gonna do it, because it'll hurt!""",1241740800,"05 8, 2009",2009,2021,"['visiting', 'London', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'American', 'Harvey', 'Shine', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'series', 'disappointments', 'been', 'bad', 'father', 'not', 'surprising', 'considering', 'more', 'interested', 'job', 'commercial', 'songwriter', 'When', 'job', 'fall', 'apart', 'too', 'one', 'final', 'chance', 'set', 'things', 'straight', 'life', 'Enter', 'Kate', 'Walker', 'Emma', 'Thompson', '40-something', 'singleton', 'who', 'one', 'final', 'chance', 'case', 'fall', 'love', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'finding', 'blind', 'caring', 'friends', 'set', 'up', 'Last', 'Chance', 'Harvey', 'sweet', 'breezy', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'What', 'obviously', 'apart', 'age', 'leads', 'most', 'rom-coms', 'feature', 'ingenues', '20s', 'early', '30s', 'often', 'matched', 'older', 'actor', 'Thompson', '49', 'Hoffman', '71', 'years', 'old', 'Falling', 'love', 'age', 'lifetime', 'prior', 'disappointments', 'feels', 'risky', 'not', 'being', 'young', 'being', 'able', 'abandon', 'one', 'self', 'love', 'Thompson', 'particular', 'perfectly', 'sense', 'desperation', 'mixed', 'fear', 'being', 'hurt', 'humiliated', 'luminous', 'totally', 'believable', 'star', 'rom-com', 'one', 'who', 'been', 'block', 'few', 'times', 'typical', 'movies', 'paired', 'older', 'actor', 'how', 'interesting', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'have', 'actor', 'closer', 'age', 'minor', 'quibble.The', 'movie', 'filled', 'gentle', 'insightful', 'humor', 'subplot', 'Thompson', 'xenophobic', 'mother', 'Dame', 'Eileen', 'Atkins', 'was', 'amusing', 'seemed', 'disconnected', 'main', 'plot', 'detracted', 'somewhat', 'movie', 'Otherwise', 'Last', 'Chance', 'Harvey', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'Second-time', 'director', 'Joel', 'Hopkins', 'Jump', 'Tomorrow', 'wisely', 'keeps', 'things', 'very', 'simple', 'movie', 'relatively', 'short', 'run', 'time', 'also', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'nothing', 'terribly', 'unique', 'Last', 'Chance', 'Harvey', 'so', 'well', 'acted', 'genuine', 'easy', 'bull', 'eye']",Last Chance Harvey

1150350,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B0015OKWKS,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[1, 1]","I still hate romantic comedies but occasionally, I would try to see one just to keep my objectivities grounded. It is a good way to not become jaded with the types of movies I see, after all there is only too much action, fantasy and horror one can see in an extended period before one gets burned out. Heck, I may have just done this for a woman, but you never know. Anyway, Joel Hopkins' ""LAST CHANCE HARVEY"" has one of the most likable actors in the person of Dustin Hoffman (Tootsie, the Graduate) so I decided to give it a chance. Written and directed by Hopkins, the film is an endearing story of just how things just tend to work out in manner truly unexpected, and that taking a chance may lead to our happiness.Harvey Shine (Dustin Hoffman) is song writer who makes commercial jingles who lives in New York. He is having some work issues, as his boss is beginning to see him as the ""old guard"" in a new generation. Well, that's the least of his worries, as he flies to London to attend his daughter's wedding--he is informed that she will be asking her step father to give her away. To make things worst, Harvey missed his return flight and is on the verge of getting fired. Enter Kate Walker (Emma Thompson) a woman who works in the statistics department. Kate is a nice lady who is committed to taking care of her mother. Harvey spends the next few hours talking with Kate that the two end up enjoying each other's company immensely. Harvey has one last chance at love, will fate bring them together?The film's main draw would have to be the performances between Thompson and Hoffman. They play off each other nicely, and I thought it was endearing that Hoffman is a lot shorter than Thompson, it gives their uneasy relationship a needed `character'. The two do appear like they're common folk that you would see walking by. The two do develop some chemistry as the film goes on, the `getting to know you' part of their relationship happens mostly off-camera, which is why some people may not really buy into their `one day' relationship and may say they lacked chemistry. Well, the movie is about taking chances and complications; director Joel Hopkins does manage to flesh out our two leads in a manner I thought was effective.The first act of the film is more about Harvey, when he arrives in London. He attends a party, with his ex-wife and daughter, and he unavoidably feels very alienated. Anyone would be bummed out when the step-father would be giving his daughter away. Then, Hopkins switches the scenes to see Kate taking care of her mom, then on a blind date that would not work out. It was also quite clever, the way Hopkins tossed in two missed opportunities for the two the meet, one in the airport and one in a cab. The screenplay by Hopkins gave the viewer a good amount of groundwork in fleshing out our two lead characters and remembers to put in a dose of fate into the mix. Only after Harvey misses his flight, with nothing to lose that the two finally get to talk in a bar/restaurant in the airport.As the title implies, this movie is about Harvey Shine. For a film like this to succeed, it has to have certain heartbreaking moments and Dustin Hoffman delivers quite a few. The scene where he does the toast in the reception is definitely touching, and when he elaborates his failure as a father and as a husband to Kate, just made Harvey one VERY sympathetic character. Emma Thompson's Kate Walker also has her share of baggage's to carry, she seemed to have been stuck in a situation that she feels obligated to follow through. Kate gives hints to her very disappointing past, in the park and also in the film's final act. It was quite sad to see one used to disappointment that it became a routine of life for her.Now, despite the charm and manner as to how Hopkins manages to get the two together, the film does have its flaws. While the direction manages to flesh out Harvey and Kate, the film focuses more on Harvey, and it feels that Kate's complications aren't as important or significant as those of Harvey's issues. Yes, Harvey does have the more unfortunate path, but I thought there were missed opportunities in fleshing out Kate's issues. I rather thought that the subplot with her mother and the next neighbor was fun and clever, but I was more curious about Kate's background. Kate feels like a supporting character rather than a lead. Harvey's character was obviously better written than hers. Also, the film falls into the usual stereotypical nuances that complicate a relationship in the last act. I thought it was very clich&eacute;d and feels a little long-winded. It would have been better to just have the `taking a chance' part take full circle; but then we see Harvey racing to the airport in pure stereotypical dramatic fashion.""Last Chance Harvey"" is a charming, endearing tale about adult romance. Despite some plot mistakes, it was admirable in its penchant for adult relationships. It has good intentions but it does come up a little short. There were parts that I wished that this movie had limited supporting interactions and instead relied more on our two characters talking, it may have focused more on the ""taking a chance"" angle. Still, the dramatic performances by Hoffman and Thompson provide the film its needed zest, and the film gets a recommended rating from me.Recommended! [3  Stars]Video/Audio: 2.35:1 ratio anamorphic widescreen. Nothing too flashy with the picture quality, some scenes lacked contrast but black levels were stronger on most. The 5.1 Dolby digital sound is quite powerful and clear, the soundtrack does sound perfectly endearing.Extras: commentary by Hopkins and making of feature.

It was a pleasant surprise to see them both paired as romantic leads [a first?] and the movie was engaging and poignant.Dustin Hoffman plays Harvey Shine, a jingle writer on the last legs of his career who travels to London to attend his daughter Susan's [Liane Balaban] wedding.The typical awkward moments are portrayed in Harvey's interactions with his ex-wife Jean [Kathy Baker], and her husband Brian [James Brolin]. Things get worse when Susan expresses her desire to have a her stepdad give her away at the wedding, reinforcing Harvey's sense of rejection.Then there is Kate Walker [Emma Thompson] who conducts surveys at the airport and finds herself at the mercy of an annoying and interfering mother. Both Harvey and Kate inevitably meet, and though it isn't much at first, the pair soon find themselves drawn to each other and enjoying each other's company.
