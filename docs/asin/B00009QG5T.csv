756979,A1T9PJBFBFKSGD,B00009QG5T,Auburn Niewiadomski,"[0, 0]","Little House on the Prairie is a show that cannot be forgotten, anyone who knows about this television series has enjoyed it...who couldn't, and I am deeply grateful that Laura Ingalls Wilder made this all possible with her books that I immensely enjoyed reading. The reason I love this show is because of my interests in this time period in American history, America's population had been growing and traveling to the west, the hostility (and peace) between the American's and the many Indian tribes and the extraordinary efforts of these pioneers. I'm a fifteen year old male (boy, who cares) and these stories still unfortunately make me cry sometimes since I consider myself a sensitive person and my emotions come through sometimes. This time period is much to be desired, while America has advanced in many areas (especially in technology) I think respect for family, community and the more simplistic enjoyments in life have became a thing of the past. These programs always make me want to (while not always) start working a bit harder and try to respect others. (although my sarcastic attitude comes through) While yet I do not believe there is a god I do like the Ingalls religious beliefs, there strong moral beliefs and I think these heartwarming stories also have made this television series a classic.The pilot focuses on the Ingalls family's struggles leaving the big woods and trying to start life a new on the prairie. Now anyone who's reading this must have seen the show, but if somehow you haven't, let me tell you, the acting is some of the finest that's ever been on television and that is as simple as I can put it. Now the reason I'm not giving this one disc DVD a flat out five stars is easy, the pilot could have easily been featured on the season one DVD and that this DVD is pretty much a bare bone set, the bonus features are extremely measly, all there really is on this set are a few cast member biographies and you know there desperate when they include the scene index as a `special feature.' This lack luster attempt is not unnoticed because this show deserves much better and that's why I'm not all impressed while yet still pleased that the show has been released on DVD. The restoration of the pilot is decent while there are a few moments of blurry and grainy film but otherwise the quality of the footage is quite nice.I have some advice for newcomers to this series, throughout the series if you see the words Directed by Michael Landon, get ready to have a nice long cry and enjoy.",4,Little House on the Prairie the Pilot,1216339200,"07 18, 2008",2008,2522,"['Little', 'House', 'Prairie', 'show', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'forgotten', 'anyone', 'who', 'television', 'series', 'enjoyed', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'am', 'deeply', 'grateful', 'Laura', 'Ingalls', 'Wilder', 'made', 'possible', 'books', 'immensely', 'enjoyed', 'reading', 'reason', 'love', 'show', 'interests', 'time', 'period', 'American', 'history', 'America', 'population', 'had', 'been', 'growing', 'traveling', 'west', 'hostility', 'peace', 'American', 'many', 'Indian', 'tribes', 'extraordinary', 'efforts', 'pioneers', ""'m"", 'fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'male', 'boy', 'who', 'stories', 'still', 'unfortunately', 'make', 'cry', 'sometimes', 'consider', 'sensitive', 'person', 'emotions', 'come', 'sometimes', 'time', 'period', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'America', 'advanced', 'many', 'areas', 'especially', 'technology', 'think', 'respect', 'family', 'community', 'more', 'simplistic', 'enjoyments', 'life', 'have', 'became', 'thing', 'past', 'programs', 'always', 'make', 'want', 'not', 'always', 'start', 'working', 'bit', 'harder', 'try', 'respect', 'others', 'sarcastic', 'attitude', 'yet', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'god', 'do', 'Ingalls', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'strong', 'moral', 'beliefs', 'think', 'heartwarming', 'stories', 'also', 'have', 'made', 'television', 'series', 'classic.The', 'pilot', 'Ingalls', 'family', 'struggles', 'leaving', 'big', 'woods', 'trying', 'start', 'life', 'new', 'prairie', 'Now', 'anyone', 'who', 'reading', 'must', 'have', 'seen', 'show', 'somehow', 'have', ""n't"", 'let', 'tell', 'acting', 'finest', 'ever', 'been', 'television', 'as', 'simple', 'can', 'put', 'Now', 'reason', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'one', 'disc', 'DVD', 'flat', 'out', 'five', 'stars', 'easy', 'pilot', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'featured', 'season', 'one', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'much', 'bare', 'bone', 'set', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'extremely', 'measly', 'really', 'set', 'are', 'few', 'cast', 'member', 'biographies', 'know', 'there', 'desperate', 'when', 'include', 'scene', 'index', 'special', 'feature', 'lack', 'luster', 'attempt', 'not', 'unnoticed', 'show', 'much', 'better', 'why', ""'m"", 'not', 'impressed', 'yet', 'still', 'pleased', 'show', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'restoration', 'pilot', 'decent', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'blurry', 'grainy', 'film', 'otherwise', 'quality', 'footage', 'quite', 'nice.I', 'have', 'advice', 'newcomers', 'series', 'series', 'see', 'words', 'Directed', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'get', 'ready', 'have', 'nice', 'long', 'cry', 'enjoy']",Little House on the Prairie - The Pilot

The movie opened with the following quote. The Ingalls family is shown standing with Caroline parents in fron of her parent's house as Laura gives this opening quote. If I had a remembrance book, I would mark down how it was when we left our little house in the big woods to go west to Indian Territory. We had to go, Pa said, because so many people had come to live in the big woods, there wasn't enough game anymore for him to hunt and he feared we might go hungry. Ma said we might never again see Grandma and Grandpa, or Aunt Docia and Aunt Ruby and Uncle George. Though it made me sad, I still thought it a fine thing to go where there had never been a road before. We'd go where the land was more bountiful, he said, and he sold our house and land and cow, and packed whatever would fit in the wagon. I was glad Pa took his fiddle, for it makes a joy some sound. Mary was afraid to go, but I knew nothing bad could happen as long as we had Pa and Jack. Jack is my best and truest friend and Pa says there has never been a better watchdog. I knew there would be rivers to cross and hills to climb, and I was glad, for this is a fair land and I rejoiced that I would see it.  So Charles and his family headed West towards Kansas in attempt to start a new life however, getting wasn't easy. The Ingalls family had to deal with high rivers that were treacherous to cross. Wild weather that includes thunderstorms and heavy down pours. So once they reached Kansas the family set up home that included a small house and small shed that stored there animals. Here are some questions that made need answer as you watched this movie. Do the Ingalls get the new start as they were hoping for? Where does stranger Isaiah Edwards play in all this? Here are some of my own thoughts about this TV movie that turn into a hit TV Series. I thought this movie was kind of a sequel to the Walton's with the only difference being that the Walton's was during the depression while the Ingalls was in the Western times. I didn't really care too much for this and I'm not sure why? There was no leading lady in this picture nor was there very much drama that kept you on the edge of your sit like other shows.

I don't think it was put into syndication? ""Little House On The Prairie"" premiered years before I was born, suffice it to say it has been one of my favorite television shows because it is a rare combination of both entertainment and family values. In fact, I cannot think of any television show that is as beloved as this wonderful series.The pilot movie introduces the Ingalls family for the first time. The characters aren't as polished or well-rounded as they are in the TV series. The pilot also introduces their longtime family friend Mr. Edwards.It starts out by telling the story of why they left their original home (and relatives). Charles finds a nice piece of land and sets up his residence for his family. It is at this time that they meet Edwards who helped in the construction of their new home.Also included in this movie is a very touching Christmas scene (that was repeated in subsequent ""flashback"" ""Little House"" episodes) where the Ingallses celebrate their first Christmas in their new home. Mr. Edwards even plays Santa by surprising the entire family with his cheer and gifts.Keep in mind that this is not set in the town of Walnut Grove (where the TV series took place). In the pilot movie they lived in a different location which was even more remote with no town and no neighbors to speak of (except the Native Americans who befriend the Ingallses).Tragedy strikes when their log house catches on fire. I thought it would all be burned down, however they were blessed with a beautiful rainstorm which saved their home and barn.But their happiness is short-lived when the government tells Charles that they have to vacate. The land is not for them; so they pack up their belongings and say good-bye to Mr. Edwards and go on their way to find a new home.The movie ends with the Ingalls family riding away. This somewhat loosely explains how they came to their new town (Walnut Grove) in the TV series.Unfortunately, television these days doesn't even come close to the high standards that Michael Landon set forth on ""Little House On The Prairie.""

Watching it shows us how culture has shifted and how so many values have been discarded in exchange for technology and ease, ie: a fast food mindset.

757008,A2PSXK2BR7VCIQ,B00009QG5T,Ms. G. R. Connors,"[21, 24]","It must have been late 1974 when series one of 'Little House on the Prairie' first aired around 7 in the evening on BBC1 here in the UK.  At first I never gave this series a look in and it would be another two years before I sat and watched an episode (""Remember Me"") all the way through, this time on the opposite channel, ITV for the London region (otherwise known as Thames Television).  From then on I would watch it regularly in its Thursday at 4.20 slot immediately after getting home from school.  Mother would also rush in to watch with me and it became a firm favorite of ours.In the early 1990's Channel 4 Television bought 'Little House' and promised a complete screening promptly starting with ""Harvest of Friends"".  No one I knew who was a fan of the show seemed to realize there was a pilot movie which made me wonder if it had ever been broadcast in the UK.  However a book I had - and still have - listing movies on TV has an entry for it so I knew that it existed.As you can imagine I was delighted when I spotted that The Pilot had been released on DVD and that complete episode seasons were also coming out as boxsets.  I couldn't wait and quickly purchased this together with the first season knowing that I would be in for some really satisfying entertainment.The Pilot is a stand alone TV movie that sells the concept of a harsh life on the Kansas plains very well.  It isn't difficult to see why NBC invested in future episodes as the writing, directing, and performances of the cast are first rate.  The music by David Rose (Bonanza), is also unforgettable.Presented in a bright case with a photo of Michael Landon dominating the cover, the film itself is exceptionally sharp and colorful.  There is a slight warping on the sound but it's not too off putting and I would still recommend this DVD to any ""Little House"" fan.Well it may have taken me 30 years to see this film which is absolutely ridiculous when I consider the number of times I have seen the series.
