The beginning sets a good mood for the rest of the film, and it doesn't take too long to get creepy. It has actually has really great scares and pop-outs that make you jump out your seat, and the story and setting altogether is really good. It also has a nice and intense ending that's memorable. Some people might not like this movie, but it's definitely and obviously better than a lot of the other PG-13 horror films this past decade.

Customer,"[11, 17]","Ok first off, I've actually met John Zaffis, who was the lead investigator during the actual haunting, during a paranormal conference in Louisiana.  He talked about what ACTUALLY happened.  That being said, I can't help but say this movie SUCKS.  The only things it really has thats ""based on the true story"" is that it's a house in Connecticut that was once a mortuary, and a family moved in.  So much of what actually happened isn't in the film, and ironically, was MUCH more interesting (e.g. sudden temperature changes, mattresses ""breathing"" and having an apparent heartbeat).  With this in mind, it was hard to concentrate on the movie, which I think was good, because from what I saw this must be the WORST attempt at ""horror"" I've ever seen.  I watch and collect alot of horror movies, and some of the worst ""B"" horror movies I've seen are far more entertaining.Just this to anyone who reads this review...there are MANY more GOOD movies out there, so don't waste your time or money on this one.

I've actually really enjoyed many movies that reviewers bash, so I always wondered if I made the right choice.  It finally became temporarily available as a free viewing thru Amazon Prime, so I was excited to watch it...but I unfortunately did not enjoy this.  In fact, I didn't even finish it.  I just thought of something better to do.This is a haunted house movie (one of my fave horror subgenres).  The plot revolves around a family that moves into an old house.  It's big, beautiful and cheap...because it has a dark and terrible PAST!  Uh-oh! Cue thunderbolts and flashing lightening! Sounds great to me! But it sounds better than it is.There have been a few good haunted house pics recently:  ""The Conjuring"" was incredibly awesome, ""Sinister"" was great, ""Insidious"" was very good, and even the similarly-named ""An American Haunting"" was spooky with a unusual and unforgettable ending.  My expectations were therefore high. Too high.""The Haunting in CT"" just struck me as being all about the strength and love of family...which is ok if that's what your expecting. I mean, I'm sorry, it was just sappy.  It was like watching a film expecting ""Cujo"" and getting a slightly tense episode of ""Lassie"" instead.  I mean, there was soo much drama in this movie, and none of it having anything to do with the supposed lurking horror in the house.  The child is sick, so everyone's constantly on edge and glaring at each other and giving each other the cold shoulder ,OR they are hugging and on the verge of tears.  Ok...  This movie had almost as much family drama as ""Dark Skies,"" a movie that I felt was decent but would've been soo much better without the all-American ,picket-fence suburban drama.  Gag.This movie has some ""jump"" moments, and I guess it's got its tension, you'know, typical horror movie hi-jinx. We get scary reflections, shadows, flashbacks, creepy cadavors, etc. But I watched almost half way into the movie, and I just didn't care to continue. The only character I liked was the mother. Everyone else began to annoy me.  I think the problem is that I watched a (in my opinion), far more superior horror movie before this, ""Grave Encounters.""  THAT movie was a good time!  A low budget, but done well, especially if you've ever seen any of the paranormal investigation shows that are all the rage right now.

1246400,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B0021L8UFI,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[1, 1]","I really liked this film. I popped it into my player not really expecting much as so many have said it is bad, but I found that I really liked it. I found the movie to have a good story, a great mood and pretty good acting. One thing I did not like about it and which is the reason I do not give it five stars is that the movie makers use allot of ""jumpy moments"" expect they are not that jumpy when it are things we have seen a million times before, there is always a ghost in the mirror and lurking behind dark corners. As a scary movie The Haunting in Connecticut fails and it might as well have stopped trying and instead focused on the story.This movie is about a family where the oldest son has cancer. The teenager is receiving experimental treatment in Connecticut so the family rents an old house there so they will not have to travel that far with their sick son every time he have to go to the hospital. Soon strange things begins to happen in the house, strange things that first only Matt, the sick son sees. Soon however the paranormal events begins to affect the entire family.Some pepole complain about the drama in this movie, for there is allot of drama, this is just as much a movie about a mother trying to cope with her son's illness as it is about ghosts. I however liked this element, it makes the movie a little different from the multitude of haunted house movies and give it an unusual depth. Also the whole sick son thing gives a good reason why the family can not just up and leave when things get creepy. One common criticism about haunted house movies is, why do not the pepole who find themselves in a haunted house just leave? Well not having money to rent anything else so the alternative is to drive for hoers with a deathly ill child is a good motivator for why stay.I also want to address the whole based on a true story thing. Often in movies the whole based on a true story element means one drop of truth to five gallons of make believe. As far as I know there was a family with a sick teenage son who rented a house in Connecticut, they did rapport seeing demons, everything else is made up for this film.Now as to the blue-ray edition, is it worth getting over a DVD? Well the picture quality is beautiful, I however is not to happy with the lack of any extras, unless off course this zone 1 version is more packed than the European version I have. If they are not to far from one another in price I would say get the blue-ray. The picture quality is excellent, however if the DVD is very much cheaper I do not think getting this on blue-ray is worth paying allot extra for.In conclusion The Haunting in Connecticut has a good story, interesting characters, a spooky mood and good acting. It is an great movie if you like haunted house movies. If what you are looking for is a gore fest, then you will not find that here. This movie rely on storytelling and mood, not bloody effect to tell it's tale. I liked the film.

E Jackson,"[1, 2]","First of all, even though the Haunting in Connecticut is available for free viewing on the Discovery Channel, I received this as a DVD along with a Haunting in Georgia on the same disc.I was initially disappointed that it wasn't an actual movie because I was told by my family it was, but instead, it's a documentary I actually watched on the Discovery Channel (I *believe* it was the Discovery Channel- can't really remember) three years ago.Either way, I'm glad I own it because it contains some REALLY creepy images of ghosts and demonic creatures roaming around the basement floor of what was once a funeral home, but now turned into a family house in order to take care of a teenage boy fighting cancer.You see this funeral home/house happens to be located right next to the town hospital, so it's easy and convenient for the family to travel only a few minutes away to the hospital. Plus the family says the price of the home was very cheap, so at first it seemed like an amazing bargain...I just wanted to mention that in case you're wondering why a family would actually move their sick child into a haunted house- they didn't have a choice given the circumstances.  Though I personally would never move somewhere THAT close to an extremely large graveyard.  Did you see the size of that thing?  It seemed to extend over many many snowy fields.  That itself would have driven me away!There's definitely a good deal of atmosphere in this (supposedly) realistic story involving incredibly evil ghosts haunting all four children, the mother, and the ghost hunters and priests themselves.  Somehow the father missed all the frightening action (perhaps because, as hinted, ghosts only mess with the vulnerable).  In fact, I'd say this ghost story is second only to the Amityville Horror.

She is superb as the mother of the cancer-stricken boy and carries this film. It starts out as a legitmately creepy film. I think I found the mortuary scenes to be more grisly than anything else. Also, I like many other people can unfortunately relate to the cancer-related treatments of loved ones scenes, which are very hard to watch. I just didn't find the film to be as scary and frightening as I had imagined it would be from the trailers and some of the critics comments. On the back of the dvd box, once such critic commented: ""Will make you afraid to turn off the lights and go to sleep"". Not me anyway. Did anyone else find the plot just a bit confusing when it came to explaining the history of the house?? I gathered the people who ran the mortuary were up to no good, but I sort of lost the plot as to just what they were doing and hoping to accomplish. I missed seeing this movie on the big screen and had to wait for the dvd release. I went for the unrated version and am not really sure just what was added to the original release. I enjoyed it for the most part, but I do think it could have been a lot better. Ultimately I came away a bit disappointed. As for blood and gore making a scary film, not always. Sometimes the things you don't see, but only hear and imagine are far more frightening. The original 1963 film ""The Haunting"" is a fine example of this done on film. I wish I could say the same for this film. I am also puzzled as to why the film's running times have been listed as being 92 minutes and 102 minutes.

1246405,A1TY4TRLA4QK5Y,B0021L8UFI,"Brian Long ""Brian""","[26, 28]","A decent horror plot combined with scares that try to get under your skin and stay there manage to make the Haunting in Connecticut one of the few buy-worthy horrors I've reviewed. Matt Campbell, a cancer patient, is struggling to cope with the constant rides to and from the hospital where he is receiving an experimental treatment. After seeing him suffer following a prolonged treatment, his mother buys a former funeral home for them to stay in during his hospital visits. What follows is a progressively aggressive assault from spirits within the home.The storyline is another of those ""based on a true story"" pieces of nonsense, which really needs to stop unless they're honestly worried about being sued. While the plot overall is nothing new, it manages to throw in enough good renditions of overdone plot points to give it a feel of being new. A few points of humor, a few character sidebars that are just a hair short of being filler, and a few extremely well done hallucination scenes manage to round out the movie as a whole, rather than leave it as a grinding startle sequence. The explanation is especially well done, just believable enough to easily swallow, yet allowing for mistakes, interpretation, and managing to provide a good basis for ""I see it! Why don't you see it!?!!""The effects are surprisingly good, despite or in spite of their simplicity. The scares are also subtle, small things that build in the background. While theres the requisite number of startles, these're thankfully overshadowed by the creepy elements that know what they're doing. A few of the moments even managed to make me, a jaded and embittered veteran of gore, wince and cringe in my seat; though there's little, if any, actual blood.The acting is also above average, While the whiny brats throw things off at a few moments, the main characters are truly well done. The lead manages to play a rarely used archetype; rather than being the one running around screaming and crying about why nobody believes poor widdle him, his reaction to the events is more ""It's my problem, I'll handle it.""Though the ending is gaggingly honey sweet and sappy, the story is good, the scares quiet, cold things that'll slide into your veins, and the acting worthwhile. A truly rare buy recommendation. The only thing that prevented it from being five stars is its something you've seen over and over before.

Even still, the stories are interesting, and every once and a while you see an episode that gives you the chills with those &#34;what if&#34; scenarios.  And quite awhile back, I watched the episode that described what happened to this family that was eventually made into this film.I am also a fan of Virginia Madsen.  If you've never seen her in her early-2000s return vehicle &#34;Sideways,&#34; I'd highly recommend driving on down the road -- sans wine glass in hand, however -- and pick up a copy at your local DVD store.  Better yet, make it a Blu-ray disk.  And maybe best still, just rent it on your Roku or Apple TV box in High Definition from the comfort of your couch where it's legal to drink a glass of Pinot while you watch.  (And don't forget to afterwards watch again and listen to the second audio track, where Paul Giammati and Thomas Haden Church are riffing on the film.  Now that might be even been better than the film, believe it or not!  It it hilarious.)So, I have the haunting story that I liked, and Ms. Madsen, who I also like, so you'd think that I'd really like this film.  Well, you'd think wrong.  Even though I'm giving it a three, this is a real borderline three; I could easily go two.  Why is it that filmmakers take real-life stories that are so good already, and then change those stories to make them &#34;better?&#34;  What you end up with is a hodge-podge of messiness that just doesn't quite work out.  I didn't buy the priest character really; and I didn't buy a lot of the stuff going on with the son who had cancer.  I think it just would have been better if they would have told the story straight.

I found the Discovery Channel documentary on the haunting,A Haunting in Connecticut, to be much more interesting, and cheaper.However, you can't beat this double disc editon for extra features, and interesting ones too. There is the featurette ""Two Dead Boys: The Making of The Haunting in Connecticut"" which talks with the cast and crew about the making of the film and the haunted hotel that they stayed in during filming. It runs about fifteen minutes.""The Fear is Real: Reinvestigating the Haunting (41:03), gets away from the movie-making end of things and goes to the actual case that inspired all of this.  Carmen Snedeker-Reed and two of her sons discuss the haunting. Also included are Carmen's neices, former neighbors, and some of the clairvoyants called in on the case at the time of the haunting. This mini-documentary is quite interesting if you enjoyed the original Discovery Channel documentary as I did and want more background both from news sources at the time and new developments and insights.Anatomy of a Haunting (11:48) talks with parapsychologist Barry Taff and psychic Jack Rourke about the supernatural. They discuss the case that inspired the film The Entity, among other matters.""Memento Mori: The History of Postmortem Photography"" (10:26) has author Stanley B. Burns talking about this odd practice. If you have seen the film ""The Others"" this will be particularly interesting.There are eight minutes worth of deleted scenes, with optional audio commentary by the director.Finally, there are two audio commentaries for the film itself. One is provided by director Cornwell, producer Andrew Trapani, writer Adam Simon, and editor Tom Elkins. It mainly involves the technical aspects of the film, and it is well done and not at all dry.The second commentary is provided by director Cornwell and actress Virginia Madsen (she plays the part of the mother in the film). This one gets more into human interest stories and the background of making the film. It veers a bit off-course but is entertaining enough.The second disc is reserved for a digital copy of the film.I'd recommend this two disc edition and not the single disc edition that apparently has no extras at all.

1246413,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0021L8UFI,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 5]","There isn't much I can say about ""The Haunting in Connecticut"" that I haven't already said about other films of this type, and that in and of itself says plenty. Let's begin with the fact that it's ""based on a true story""--if there's one thing horror movies have taught me time and time again, it's to take such claims with more than a few grains of salt. Honestly, does anyone believe that these events actually happened? Let the details speak for themselves; during the 1980s, the Snedeker family claimed that their Southington, Connecticut home was plagued by some kind of demonic presence, resulting in a slew of supernatural occurrences. Carmen Snedeker, the mother, claimed to have seen a number of apparitions. It wasn't long before she contacted paranormal experts Ed and Lorraine Warren, who were also involved in the case that came to be known as ""The Amityville Horror""; after nine weeks in the Snedeker house, the Warrens and their investigating team were reportedly ""touched"" by unseen entities, and the house was always ripe with the smell of decay.It was eventually discovered that the house was once a funeral home, and that one of the workers was apparently guilty of necrophilia. The house was then ""exorcised,"" and the supernatural phenomena stopped altogether. The Snedekers moved away. Other families came and went. None of them have made any reports of poltergeist activity.All history (and its lack of credibility) aside, ""The Haunting in Connecticut"" is really no more or less than your average haunted house film, so loaded with clich&eacute;s that you can practically check them off as the story progresses. This brings me to another subject I've frequently written about in horror reviews, and that's the historical significance of the house itself. When I reviewed ""The Messengers"" a few years ago, I made reference to a plot device I like to call The House That Something Bad Happened in. You know the setup: A family moves into a seemingly perfect house, witnesses a series of supernatural occurrences, and eventually learns that the dark history of the house is to blame. ""The Haunting in Connecticut"" is no exception to this rule ... or, for that matter, any other rule horror movies tend to follow.The plot, which takes place in June of 1987: Peter and Sara Campbell (Martin Donovan and Virginia Madsen), in spite of their financial problems, decide to move to Connecticut so that their cancer-stricken teenage son, Matt (Kyle Gallner), won't have to travel as far to get treatment. When they arrive at their new house, Matt takes residence in the basement, which leads to a locked chamber with tinted windows. It isn't long before he's plagued by a series of strange, frightening visions: his mother mopping the floor with blood instead of water; a bearded man and a teenage boy surrounded by mortuary equipment; eyelids being snipped off; a cadaver with words carved into its skin; burned corpses that groan a lot; a s&eacute;ance circle interrupted by a teenage boy spewing ectoplasm. All of this somehow relates to that basement chamber, which only opens at just such a time when it's most convenient. What secrets does it hold? What is Matt seeing? And why is he seeing it?The answers to all of the above are given, but who cares? This movie is more concerned with creating atmosphere than with telling a decent story. That being said, the atmosphere is spot on, and I give credit to composer Robert J. Kral for his tense score, cinematographer Adam Swica for his eerie lighting, and production designer Alicia Keywan for her intimidating set pieces. One of the most effective scenes occurs late in the film, when phantom bursts of light emanate from empty light bulb sockets; it effectively makes use of all three creative elements.Not quite so effective are the pop-out scares, which are never in short supply in a haunted house. Indeed, there are so many startling moments in this film that they eventually lose their ability to startle. And the image of the kid vomiting ectoplasm wasn't frightening, although considering the clever way it's revealed, I had the feeling that it was supposed to be. But that's impossible; many photographs have been taken showing ectoplasm emerging from mediums, and as far as I know, all of them have been proven as hoaxes.Even less effective are the characters, who seem so passive and one-dimensional it's as if the actors were taking the material seriously. There's never a moment when Matt isn't brooding over something, and while I understand that cancer can have that effect, I still think it was a bit overplayed. His parents are there only when it's convenient for the plot; his mother is weepy and desperate for his recovery while his father is a detached alcoholic. One of the most baffling characters is Reverend Popescu (Elias Koteas), a cancer patient who just happens to understand the supernatural problems Matt is having. His explanations for what's going on are unbelievably inane, and what's worse, he relies almost entirely on speculation. Such a man would never be given the time of day. Not by any rational person, at least.The long and short of it is that ""The Haunting in Connecticut"" doesn't work as a horror film, and it works even less as a document of an actual event (assuming there even was an actual event). The only way it works is in its ability to develop mood, which can sustain a film only for so long. A small but important side note: As a personal favor to me, I would really appreciate it if you horror filmmakers stopped ending your ""true"" stories with facts for the audience to read. I go to these movies to get scared, not to get a history lesson. But this movie barely managed to scare me at all, so I guess the point is moot.",3,Home Scary Home,1238112000,"03 27, 2009",2009,5743,"[""n't"", 'much', 'can', 'say', 'Haunting', 'Connecticut',

If you want something scary or intriguing, look elsewhere (Elsewhere as in the impossible not to compareThe Amityville Horror, which ironically, is connected to the real haunting).  I did not think this was a bad movie, but it definitely was not good, and I was not scared.Based on true story, this film tells the story of the Campbell family who move to Connecticut.  Matt (Kyle Gallner) has cancer and needs to be close to the hospital for his treatment.  In a money crunch, Sara (Virginia Madsen) decides to move into a house that she had originally passed on.  Almost instantly, Matt begins to see and experience strange things.  No one else does, so it may just be the meds.  Then one night, terrifying occurrences happen to everyone in the house.  Reverend Popescu (Elias Koteas) intervenes to assist this family in peril.Some quick comments: 1) Wendy (Amanda Crew) resembles a dark haired Molly Ringwald. 2) The whole subplot of Peter Campbell (Martin Donovan) and his alcoholism was completely unnecessary.  3) The very interesting concept of the sick/dying being in between the living and the dead was under utilized.  4) Nothing, other than the date written across the screen, told me this movie took place in the 80's.  Not that I was expecting a stereotypical caricature, but it was obviously supposed to appeal to audiences today more so than be true to inspiration. 5) Creepy images in the background and loud blasts of music are not scary, they are lazy.  Some movies use the creeps in the background to make you look twice or play mind games with the audience (""Did you see that?""), but when you signal the audience with music and then punctuate it with loud noises or other things it is too obvious to be scary.  And doing it over and over and.... will eventually condition the audience to expect it, thereby defeating the purpose.From what I hear, the Discovery channel documentaryA Haunting in Connecticutis far more interesting, so that is my next stop.  As for this film, I will not recommend it, but I will not say that it is horrible.

1246418,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B0021L8UFI,Dave. K,"[2, 2]","THE HAUNTING IN CONNECTICUT***  Out of 5Release Date- March 27th, 2009Running Time- 102-MinutesRating- PG-13Screenplay- Adam Simon & Tim MetcalfeDirector- Peter CornwellStarring- Virginia Madsen, Kyle Gallner, Martin Donovan, Amanda Crew, Erik Berg, John Bluethner and Elias Koteas as Reverend PopescuThe based off a true story gimmick is something that Hollywood loves to do and it normally works. The words based on a true story more often than not bring people in to the cinemas even if it bares any real resemblance to the story it's based off. When you go into The Haunting in Connecticut keep that in mind and if you know the story ignore that and take the movie for what it's worth.The American ghost story really hasn't been that strong since probably the 80s and while over the years there has been some good ones there just often seems to be something lacking and by the time 2000 rolled around they were all, but dead except for Asia where they totally reinvented the ghost genre and made it fresh again. But like the slasher films of the 80s the Asian ghost story was ran into the ground where it was nothing more than the same movie with different actors. The Haunting in Connecticut is one of the better American ghost stories to come out in quite some time, which isn't saying much since the movie is really nothing special.The biggest problem I had with The Haunting in Connecticut is that the movie is always on the verge of being an excellent horror flick, but just as it's about to get there it just falls a step short. In no way though is this a bad movie; it is enjoyable and works well and I didn't dislike the movie, but I just felt there was potential to be a lot more than it was, but by the final act is does run out of steam and does have some moments that are a bit over the top.The screenplay by Adam Simon & Tim Metcalfe is well written for the most part, but the biggest problem are the characters really lack any depth, which in a splatter flick is fine, but in a movie that relies more on the characters rather than the on screen violence that does create a bit of a problem. The characters are just there sort of there and they never add much to the story, which again is the biggest flaw since The Haunting in Connecticut relies on the characters. Sarah Campbell played by Virginia Madsen and Matt Campbell played by Kyle Gallner are the main characters and while both are likeable they lack the depth to carry the picture; of all the characters they are the most developed, which once again isn't saying much since there isn't a whole lot done with them.There is some decent attempts with given the story some life with Peter Campbell played by Martin Donovan having a history of being an alcoholic, but nothing is really ever done with that and all it really was is a passing mention and when he falls off the wagon I doubt anyone will really care since such little is done with the character. Donovan is a solid actor at best when playing someone a little shady and here he was given a different character to play than he normally does too bad he was failed with the script.The rest of the characters are just simply there and really add nothing to the story, they could have easily been written out of the movie since they don't add anything to the plot. Even with those major flaws Simon and Metcalfe do deliver a decent script, but like I said the characters lack depth and in the end that is what leads to the downfall. Elias Koteas plays Reverend Popescu and he's meant to have an impact on the movie, but he could be easily removed and not have much of an effect on the story.Director Peter Cornwell does a fairly good job in the sense the pacing is pretty good, while it isn't exactly fast paced the movie never really drags with the exception of a few scenes, which feel like nothing more than fillers. From a story standpoint, Peter Cornwell does a good job like I said the pacing is pretty good and the story pretty always moves forward or at least as much as the script allows it, but the scares are too by the books and feel like every other movie that came before with nothing new added at all. The Haunting in Connecticut also lacks the eerie feel needed to really work well. Despite the flaws the original Amityville Horror has that eerie feel in the house and that's where this movie really falls flat. We never get that sense of dread or any legit eerie feel of something evil being in the house.The suspense level ranges from decent to below average; towards the final act there is a pretty good run of some decent suspense, but soon falls a part as the movie gets a little too over the top. Overall there are a couple of jump scenes, but not enough and there isn't enough suspense to make this anything, but a good if not slightly lack luster horror flick. Peter Cornwell does manage to build some decent suspense here and there, but he's never able to maintain that through out the running time. Like I said earlier The Haunting in Connecticut had the potential to be a little more than it was, but it just never is able to reach that level.The performances were mostly solid with Madsen and Gallner being the strongest of the cast the rest of the actors are good, but since they aren't developed and never really given much of a point to the story I suppose there is only so much they can do.Overall The Haunting in Connecticut has it's moments, but it never reaches the potential it had; overall while the movie is sort of forgettable it does serve it's purpose; don't expect anything you haven't seen before and just take for what it is. There is some decent suspense and maybe a decent scare or two, but it was held back by a script that has some good ideas, but never fully executed and too by the books directing; despite the flaws The Haunting in Connecticut is still an enjoyable movie, but could have been so much more.The Blu-ray release was excellent; these days' companies are getting cheaper and cheaper with the extras, but this disc does deliver. There are some behind the scenes footage plus a 41-minute documentary featuring interviews with the people whose story inspired the movie. As for the transfer it was strong, but not the best I've seen and the audio is solid. Overall the disc delivers the goods with the extras and good, but not great transfer.",3,"Good, but could have been better",1256342400,"10 24, 2009",2009,6330,"['HAUNTING', 'IN', 'CONNECTICUT***',

1246419,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,B0021L8UFI,David Girod,"[0, 0]","Here is the thing with ""Haunting in Connecticut""...it's a jump at you horror movie. One of those flicks where everything is quiet, and then blam! The music blares and there is a creepy face staring at the heroine who screams. All designed to make you jump. Yes, there are some more subtle scares sprinkled throughout, but the majority of chills comes from this pop-out-at-you type of scare.The basic storyline is take ""The Amityville Horror"" and instead of an Indian burial ground make it an undertaker who doesn't quite get the job done in Connecticut. This is another horror story ""based on a true story"" for whatever that's worth. When a family moves into what was once the undertaker's home strange things begin to happen. Does the teenage son suffering from cancer factor into why the house is suddenly active? And who is the ghost kid walking the halls, what does he want? I won't spoil the fun. And while the storyline really isn't anything new, ""Haunting in Connecticut"" makes the most of it's production budget with decent acting, fine direction, some creepy sets and special effects as well as a pretty good script. But at the heart of the film, it simply is a jump at you horror movie.I know some folks hate this type of flick, and consider these pop out at you ghoulies as ""cheap"" scares. And while I can understand not being a fan, I still enjoyed ""The Haunting in Connecticut"". Yes, it did cause me to jump several times, and I was cussing after each one, or laughing with my wife who watched it with me about which one of us jumped higher as our heartbeats returned to normal. And really, when you get down to it, that is one of the reasons I watch horror movies, I want that jolt of terror followed by a quick release of laughter. It's fun.So many horror films take themselves too seriously these days, it was nice to catch a breather with ""Haunting in Connecticut"". One thing to note that almost turned me away from picking this movie up, is the ad campaign. I remember seeing commercials for this flick and they emphasized the kid spewing some CGI silly putty. With the awful memories of the remake of ""The Haunting"" and the CGI mess it made all over my television, I seriously debated whether I was up for another CGI ghost story. I'm sorry but CGI ghosts are simply awful. Luckily, if you share a similar concern, don't worry, the CGI silly putty thing is only in one scene...and does not represent the ghosts in the flick, the ghoulies found here are of the actors in spooky makeup variety.",3,You'll Either Enjoy it or Hate it,1252368000,"09 8, 2009",2009,2511,"['Here', 'thing', 'Haunting', 'Connecticut', 'jump', 'horror', 'movie', 'One', 'flicks', 'where', 'everything', 'quiet', 'then', 'blam', 'music', 'creepy', 'face', 'staring', 'heroine', 'who', 'designed', 'make', 'jump', 'Yes', 'are', 'more', 'subtle', 'scares', 'sprinkled', 'majority', 'chills', 'pop-out-at-you', 'type', 'scare.The', 'basic', 'storyline', 'take', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'instead', 'Indian', 'burial', 'ground', 'make', 'undertaker', 'who', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'Connecticut', 'horror', 'story', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'worth', 'When', 'family', 'what', 'was', 'once', 'undertaker', 'home', 'strange', 'things', 'begin', 'happen', 'teenage', 'son', 'suffering', 'cancer', 'factor', 'why', 'house', 'suddenly', 'active', 'who', 'ghost', 'kid', 'walking', 'halls', 'what', 'want', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'fun', 'storyline', 'really', ""n't"", 'anything', 'new', 'Haunting', 'Connecticut', 'most', 'production', 'budget', 'decent', 'acting', 'fine', 'direction', 'creepy', 'sets', 'special', 'effects', 'as', 'well', 'pretty', 'good', 'script', 'heart', 'film', 'simply', 'jump', 'horror', 'movie.I', 'know', 'folks', 'hate', 'type', 'flick', 'consider', 'pop', 'out', 'ghoulies', 'cheap', 'scares', 'can', 'understand', 'not', 'being', 'fan', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'Haunting', 'Connecticut', 'Yes', 'did', 'cause', 'jump', 'several', 'times', 'was', 'cussing', 'one', 'laughing', 'wife', 'who', 'watched', 'one', 'jumped', 'higher', 'heartbeats', 'returned', 'normal', 'really', 'when', 'get', 'down', 'one', 'reasons', 'watch', 'horror', 'movies', 'want', 'jolt', 'terror', 'followed', 'quick', 'release', 'laughter', 'fun.So', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'days', 'was', 'nice', 'catch', 'breather', 'Haunting', 'Connecticut', 'One', 'thing', 'note', 'almost', 'turned', 'away', 'picking', 'movie', 'up', 'ad', 'campaign', 'remember', 'seeing', 'commercials', 'flick', 'emphasized', 'kid', 'spewing', 'CGI', 'silly', 'putty', 'awful', 'memories', 'remake', 'Haunting', 'CGI', 'mess', 'made', 'television', 'seriously', 'debated', 'was', 'up', 'CGI', 'ghost', 'story', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'CGI', 'ghosts', 'are', 'simply', 'awful', 'Luckily', 'share', 'similar', 'concern', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'CGI', 'silly', 'putty', 'thing', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'not', 'represent', 'ghosts', 'flick', 'ghoulies', 'found', 'here', 'are', 'actors', 'spooky', 'makeup', 'variety']",N/A

But I do have to say that the movie, with it's pitfalls, Is a well directed, eerily executed film worthy of your ghost movie collection. The move-the-hell-out argument was in my mind too when I saw what this family was going through. Still, you have to take into account the other factors like the annoyingly long rides with her cancer stricken son (you can say that doing that was better than staying in that house, but knowing as I do what cancer can do to a person having witnessed it myself, I can understand the mom's decision to end that suffering for her son) and the financially strapped situation her family was in due to the hospital bills. But yes, when it was revealed that the ghosts were in that basement with her son, it's definitely time to jump ship, no arguments otherwise. Even staying outside in the woods would have been preferable to the scares they had to endure. Also, the backstory of Jonah, the tortured medium was not properly developed. The shortcomings don't really detract enough though, of your horror experience and like the original Amityville Horror, there's a bit more believability in the story than other ghost thrillers and just enough of a modern touch to the scares that gives the film it's best elements.

Or - leave your CHILDREN in a house that you truly believe to be haunted and torturing your cancer stricken son.

Matt's parents decided to purchase an old house in Connecticut to make it easier on him.  At this point, the boy begins to experience strange things.  The question appears to be whether Matt is encountering ghosts or is he just experiencing hallucinations as a result of his treatment.  As the movie goes on, the boy's experiences get worse, and the rest of his family begin to have similar experiences to the point where the family's lives are supposedly threatened.Aside from the fact that I believe this so-called ""true story"" to be complete garbage, the movie, as far as entertainment value goes, isn't any better than the rubbish it's based on.  Problems abound in ""The Haunting in Connecticut"".  It seems that the creators of this movie just did not know what to do except to throw a few ""jump at ya"" scenes that were no more effective at being scary than anyone's ""boo"".  The movie completely fails to establish any kind of mood or horror movie-like atmosphere.  Likewise, the movie fails to build any suspense or tension.  Instead, the makers of this flick rely on a lousy script and a completely boring story riddled by stupid repetitious flashbacks that are more embarrassing to the horror genre rather than scary.  The result is a movie that is completely lacking in substance, style and imagination.  ""A Haunting in Connecticut"" just never seems to get anywhere.  Basically, there just is not anything to this flick at all aside from the forced climax (if you can even call it that).  It's not scary, it's not clever and it's not believable.Quite frankly, the acting is not very good for a movie as highly publicized as this movie was.  Madsen does an adequate job, and the man who played the minister was pretty good, but the rest of the cast was rather poor.  Not much I can really say that I liked about this movie.  Usually, a movie such as this has at the very least an intriguing story-line, but while ""A Haunting in Connecticut"" appears to be interesting on the surface, it simply does not deliver the goods in substance.  I came away very disappointed, but I can't say that I was surprised.  If you are looking for a scary haunted house movie, it is best to look elsewhere.  In fact, if you're really wanting a good haunted house movie, you're going to have to go back to the gems of the 1970s and early 80s to find it.  One thing is for sure, you will not find it here.

Poltergeist, The Amityville Horror, The Exorcist, The Exorcism of Emily Rose, The Ring, The Grudge...The Haunting in Connecticut attempts to tell a supposedly true story, in a fashion that will probably remind you of The Amityville Horror, but it really fails to capitalize on the fear that a good ghost story should instigate.The beginning of the film starts off strong and interesting, and VERY creepy, with the filmmakers utilizing the technique of not showing you actually what's going on. One of the scariest moments in the film  happens in the beginning, when the mother is doing the laundry or something, and she hears someone walking upstairs. Subtle things like this really help bring the fear. Other moments, like short glimpses of ghosts in mirrors and things like that also builds the fear...but soon after that, everything goes down hill.The plot really doesn't evolve into much of anything. There isn't a big plot twist or sudden realization at the end. There's no cliffhanger ending to leave you grasping for more, and there's really nothing that will keep you very interesting in what's going on. In fact, you will be bored of the plot shortly before the climax, though the climax does admittedly throw some excitement into the mix.The special effects were well done, though they over-do the ghosts towards the end and the plot isn't really all that interesting.

I won't give the plot etc away, as most reviewers are fond of doing, but will just say why it is so bad. Every so-called scary moment is entirely predictable and the same eg boy looks through darkened glass and BOOM face appears only to disappear when he looks again. Cupboard door swings open and BOOM there is a figure in the mirror which is gone in the next shot. Mother is washing the floor and BOOM she is mopping it with blood (yawn) which, again, is gone in the next shot. This is done with the usual 'boom' music and happens SO many times it is ludicrous. This is also the only scare tactic employed in the film. There is no suspense in the film at all - for that you need a film like 'The Others' or 'The Village' (which I wouldn't really class as horror - it's far, far more than that). The Haunting in Connecticut could be seen as the 'anti-Others'.The rest is all stereotyped too - big house - very big house - why they need this for a few people I can't imagine. Ghosts mooching about - being totally indirect as usual. Appear (boom), disappear, appear (boom), disappear. One-dimensional family and so on... Basically, if it's predicatable, it's here. Now, I can sit through most horrors and even enjoy the b-grade ones but this one is so below par that even I nearly turned it off.As an aside, the most chilling horrors - and I mean horrors here - I have seen of late were both French and I highly recommend them - Martyrs & Frontier(s). Now these are A+++ horror, especailly Martyrs, which actually challenges you to think on quite a deep level. A couple of other excellent ones are Rec.

Wilkerson,"[7, 9]","When Matt Campbell (Kyle Gallner) gets accepted to an experimental treatment for his terminal cancer, rather than make the commute hours to and from the hospital, his mother Sara Campbell (Virginia Madsen) decides the family is going to rent a house nearer to the hospital. After moving in they realize that the house used to be an old funeral parlor, rather than leave though they decide to stay for Matt's sake. As time goes on Matt begins to see things, things that appear to be hallucinations, but eventually become more. As things spiral further and further out of control the final finds themselves horrified by the events that happen in their lives and that took place in the house long ago.The Haunting in Connecticut, in the fashion of The Amityville Horror, is based on a true story. Translated from the documentary that appeared on the Discovery Channel of nearly the same name, A Haunting in Connecticut, the movie naturally takes liberties with the original story in an effort to make it more appealing to a mass audience and ""scarier"". Today, though, horror movies more often than not are contrived and derivative of movies that came before and were far better. Does The Haunting in Connecticut rise above the rest or does it fall into the same trap as the rest of those subpar horror movies of the last decade?It more than ably falls into the trap of past horror films. By borrowing from so many other horror films that are so much better than this film it only serves as a reminder of just how bad this film is. There's the guy with a tough time going through horrible mood swings (The Amityville Horror and The Shining), said guy in what appears to be an attempt to attack those who are close to him puts an ax through a door (The Shining), they even use the line ""As I was going up the stair / I met a man who wasn't there. / He wasn't there again today / I wish, I wish he'd go away"" (Identity) and tries to come up with one of it's own with the ""One bright night in the middle of the day.."" poem. Throughout the entire movie I couldn't help but wish I was watching one of those other movies rather than this one.All of this is only compounded by what is a sloppy script and sloppy directing and editing. There are moments when they try to use moments for the true story, but are never expounded on and quickly move on to the next scene before we even have an opportunity to process them. But when you do finally get the opportunity to process them you realize that they don't do anything to further the story along or even help us to get to know the characters. At times the director moves on to cliche moves to try to make the audience jump that just don't work anymore, and thinks he's being stylistic by quickly moving between flashback takes and quick cuts, but instead it becomes nauseating proof that the director has no style of his own but must copy other directors and to a lesser outcome. And that's saying nothing of the make up work and effects. The ectoplasm effect is possibly the best effect in the movie, but rather than working with the rest of the set, the camera focuses too much on it making it look even more fake than it already is.As for the acting, most of the actors look that they're either bored or just walking through the paces. Most disappointing of these is Virginia Madsen. Nominated for an Oscar for her work in Sideways, just the fact that she appears in this movie is low enough as it is, but the lack of enthusiasm shows just how much this movie was about the paycheck. Even Kyle Gallner who is practically starring in his first major role in a motion picture can't seem to be woken up from his stupor to even tell if he's a good actor or not. If there is a best actor in the group, it would be Elias Koteas (The Prophecy, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Fallen, etc.) is the only one who seems to take his character to heart and seems to really care about the movie. If there's a reason to see the movie, he would be it.In the end, I can't, in good conscience, really recommend this movie to anyone. If you're a big horror movie fan that'll take the bad with the good, well, you'll watch it anyway. If you're someone that just likes watching movies and were thinking about giving this a chance because you're jonesing for a good horror, forget this and go pick up Drag Me To Hell (best horror movie of the decade!).

It picks up at the end but by that time I didn't really care.In the beginning when you first see the family, you get to know Matthew Campbell, who is dying of cancer and his worried mother. The family decides to move closer to the hospital where Matthew is undergoing treatment and rent a house that is haunted. The rest of the family are invisible until horrible things start happening to them. When the hauntings kick into gear, it wasn't much of a shock because I didn't really know about the characters as real people so it didn't bother me.There were a few cheap thrills towards the end of the movie. It was like walking through a haunted house and having various strange things jump out at you. This movie had a lot of potential that just wasn't there.There have been better examples of character driven horror movies that really work with the haunting there like Robert Wise's The Haunting and even Poltergeist.Still, this movie reminded me of many horror/ghost movies of the 80's and that's the one thing I actually liked about it.It could only be scary if you were sitting home alone at night with a thunder and lighting storm going on outside.

1246442,A106016KSI0YQ,B0021L8UFI,Jay Dickson,"[0, 0]","There are so many fine elements amassed for Peter Cornwell's 2009 haunted house film that it's disappointing it's not better than it is. The house (with a secret mortuary room in its basement) to where the Campbell family moves in order to be closer to a hospital where their Hodgkins' lymphoma-riddled son Matt is being treated looks wonderfully ghastly, and the film is beautifully lit. Its flashbacks to the earlier part of the 20th century (when the house was being used for all kinds of unpleasant experiments in mortuary science, necromancy, and spiritualism) look even better, with a visual style reminiscent of the kinds of photographs of the dead immortalized in Michael Lesy's 1973 classic historical archive WISCONSIN DEATH TRIP, look even better. There are some fine special effects, particularly involving the manifestation of ectoplasm in the way you might have hoped it had really looked like in old seances, had it not always a hoax. And the cast is much, much better than you'd ever imagine for a low-budget horror film, with some of the finest indie actors of the last twenty years, including Virginia Madsen, Martin Donovan, and Elias Koteas, playing major roles, and with the newer young actor Kyle Gallner in a fine central performance as Matt Campbell.But the film keeps taking several missteps, beginning on the insistence that its based on a true story (which it is only of you use ""based"" and ""true"" in their loosest of definitions). The movie has far too many cheap jolts such that you become inured to them after a while, and the cliched score (with its sudden metallic dissonant chords) doesn't help much either. The script really lets the actors down, with far too much of an arc like Spielberg's POLTERGEIST (i.e. when you think you've exorcised the ghosts you've of course only made things worse), and even the multiple references to so many past horror films, such as SUSPIRIA and particularly KWAIDAN, only weigh things down. And the actors, particularly Donovan (cursed with a subplot involving alcoholism that comes out of nowhere) and Koteas (playing an awful expositional part), are let down by the script. It's so much fun to have a film where the mortuary history of the early 20th century plays an important role that you're let down that the film isn't better than it could have been.",3,The ectoplasm's there; the spark is not,1261180800,"12 19, 2009",2009,2325,"['are', 'so', 'many', 'fine', 'elements', 'amassed', 'Peter', 'Cornwell', '2009', 'haunted', 'house', 'film', 'disappointing', 'not', 'better', 'house', 'secret', 'mortuary', 'room', 'basement', 'where', 'Campbell', 'family', 'moves', 'order', 'be', 'closer', 'hospital', 'where', 'Hodgkins', 'lymphoma-riddled', 'son', 'Matt', 'being', 'treated', 'looks', 'wonderfully', 'ghastly', 'film', 'beautifully', 'lit', 'flashbacks', 'earlier', 'part', '20th', 'century', 'when', 'house', 'was', 'being', 'used', 'kinds', 'unpleasant', 'experiments', 'mortuary', 'science', 'necromancy', 'spiritualism', 'look', 'even', 'better', 'visual', 'style', 'reminiscent', 'kinds', 'photographs', 'dead', 'immortalized', 'Michael', 'Lesy', '1973', 'classic', 'historical', 'archive', 'WISCONSIN', 'DEATH', 'TRIP', 'look', 'even', 'better', 'are', 'fine', 'special', 'effects', 'particularly', 'involving', 'manifestation', 'ectoplasm', 'way', 'might', 'have', 'hoped', 'had', 'really', 'looked', 'old', 'seances', 'had', 'not', 'always', 'hoax', 'cast', 'much', 'much', 'better', ""'d"", 'ever', 'imagine', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'film', 'finest', 'indie', 'actors', 'last', 'twenty', 'years', 'including', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'Martin', 'Donovan', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'playing', 'major', 'roles', 'newer', 'young', 'actor', 'Kyle', 'Gallner', 'fine', 'central', 'performance', 'Matt', 'Campbell.But', 'film', 'taking', 'several', 'missteps', 'beginning', 'insistence', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'only', 'use', 'based', 'true', 'loosest', 'definitions', 'movie', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'cheap', 'jolts', 'such', 'become', 'inured', 'while', 'cliched', 'score', 'sudden', 'metallic', 'dissonant', 'chords', ""n't"", 'help', 'much', 'script', 'really', 'actors', 'down', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'arc', 'Spielberg', 'POLTERGEIST', 'i.e', 'when', 'think', ""'ve"", 'exorcised', 'ghosts', ""'ve"", 'course', 'only', 'made', 'things', 'worse', 'even', 'multiple', 'references', 'so', 'many', 'past', 'horror', 'films', 'such', 'SUSPIRIA', 'particularly', 'KWAIDAN', 'only', 'weigh', 'things', 'down', 'actors', 'particularly', 'Donovan', 'cursed', 'subplot', 'involving', 'alcoholism', 'nowhere', 'Koteas', 'playing', 'awful', 'expositional', 'part', 'are', 'let', 'down', 'script', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'have', 'film', 'where', 'mortuary', 'history', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'plays', 'important', 'role', ""'re"", 'let', 'down', 'film', ""n't"", 'better', 'could', 'have', 'been']",N/A
1246443,A20L3YKLJA2G95,B0021L8UFI,Jay,"[1, 2]","The Haunting in Connecticut has been a story that intrigued me for sometime now so naturally I had to see the film. I first caught the story on the Discovery Channels show ""A Haunting"" showcasing the Connecticut incident. After seeing that I must admit it seemed one of the creepier ghost stories I'd ever heard. As for the film itself it was quite different from what the story from the show claimed to be. Obviously the film is loosely based on ""actual events,"" but almost every Hollywood feature that claims to be true attempts to spice it up a bit.A family moves into a Connecticut home to be closer to the hospital where their son Matt is going for cancer treatment. Once arriving in the home Matt chooses the basement as his bedroom and that's when things begin to happen. On a daily basis Matt see's a young boy wandering throughout the house, then begins to have darker visions of him being a medium to communicate with the dead. Once more of the family starts to have situations they seek out the homes history and find a very sick past. The home used to be a funeral parlor and a lot of evil deeds were done. The demonic entities begin plaguing everyone in the house until they find a way to release the spirits from the home.In comparison to the actual details of the haunting, the film is certainly loosely based on the actual events. The true story tells of the mortician speaking to Matt at the foot of his bed each evening forcing him to become a recluse. He was even sent away after attempting to rape his cousin where he was evaluated and then released. This version has the typical big feature changes all over it to really spruce up the scares. If the story actually happened as the movie states then you'd never want to move into another home just for the possibility something like this could happen.

Virginia Madsen is a personal favorite actor of mine, so it was a real plus for me that she was in the film. Kyle Gallner is outstanding as her afflicted son, Jonah. The direction was excellent--as was the art direction/production design. The sets seemed to draw you in, as if you were actually there, intimately watching the very scary goodness. There were a few elements that seemed transposed from other films, like the little picture book featuring the recently deceased in domestic poses (THE OTHERS) and the image of having an entire body with carefully applied magic text (KWAIDAN).

1246446,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B0021L8UFI,J from NY,"[1, 3]","Yet another broken promise from the contemporary horror genre, ""The Haunting In Connecticut"" should only be seen in theatres.  That way one has an excuse to get up and take breaks--popcorn, candy, a cigarette, I don't know.  Also, this is more a music video than an actual movie: it was clearly intended for theatre viewing because it consists mainly of flashbulb photographic flashbacks of seances and plastic looking dummies which are supposed to be victims of an evil funeral home director.  In case you haven't guessed yet, the family is living in the former evil funeral home!  (I just had deja vu.  People searching through papers at the local library, like in ""The Amityville Horror""!  Which was also based on a not true true story which was debunked!  Maybe I'm living in a house that was once owned by Roger Corman or was a B film studio.)Kyle Gallner had some potential in his role as Matt Campbell, an unfortunate young man who is suffering from cancer very early in his life.  He seems naturally to look anguished and sickly.  He is wasted in this role, but it is not his fault.  His performance as a budding serial killer on that great cop show ""The Shield"" revealed his talent for being creepy, but I guess his agent wanted to get him out there too quick.The plot is so thick with stereotypes that you can cut it with a yawn.  A family has to move.  They do.  The house has a sinister haunted terrible past.  Bad, unexplainable things happen (flashbacks and photographs of really phony looking people).  A priest shows up with a cross made of magnets and searches--try not to laugh--at the ectoplasmic rage of the medium killed by the funeral home director.  Everything seems okay after he shows up, but no!  Lighting storms happen, the answering machine sounds weird, and the house has to be set on fire!At no point does this become believable.  It unfairly borrows from movies that were actually frightening.  I gave it two stars because I know there were garbage men on the set who had to witness this and actually work--no one else was.(This movie is named after Robert Aickman, a great horror author mostly neglected now.

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[0, 0]","Loosely based on the Snedeker family story from the book ""In A Dark Place"" and the brilliant documentary ""A Haunting In Connecticut,"" ""The Haunting In Connecticut"" fails to rise above it's base material.As the plot of the film goes, the Campbell family takes up residency in a home ""with a dark past"" in order to have their ill son closer to the hospital where he is receiving treatment for his cancer.  Once they've moved in, however, strange things begin to happen.  The son, Matt (Kyle Gallner), begins to see things.  His mother, Sara, discovers bizarre photos of the home taken while it was a funeral parlor.  Eventually Matt's behavior becomes increasingly erratic and even dangerous to the rest of the family.  Enter Reverend Popescu (Elias Koteas), a fellow cancer fighter who agrees to help Matt and his cousin, Wendy (Amanda Crew), get to the bottom of what is causing Matt's problems.Up until that point in the film, the story is actually pretty good.  It's once the truth begins to reveal itself that the film loses its direction.  It becomes rather formulaic and relies on cheap scare tactics in order to draw a response from the audience.  The climax is rather goofy as well.As a whole, the film is a dud.  Were it not for the strong performances of Gallner, Crew and Madsen (who's severely underappreciated in my opinion), this film would almost have been unwatchable.  Koteas' character is stock and nothing new for films of this sort.  Martin Donovan is also underused as the alcholic patriarch of the family.I highly recommend the Discovery Channel documentary ""A Haunting In Connecticut"" that is partly used for the basis of this film.  In my opinion it is much more chilling than the Hollywood version of the Snedeker family's dilemma.  The film leaves out a number of key events and crucial plot points from the actual story, particularly the efforts of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren and the Catholic Church to help the family and the strong faith of the mother (although we get fleeting glimpses of her clutching her rosary and the same rosary hanging from the rearview mirror).Overall, ""The Haunting In Connecticut"" ends up as just another chapter in the seemingly endless book of generic Hollywood ghost stories.  The performances of key actors in the film help it become much more than it really is, but it can't hold a candle to the (perhaps) true story that it is so loosely based on.

Maybe ""inspired by true events"" would have been better. The older boy did have cancer and they did move into a house that was a funeral home/haunted but the older boy was actually sent to a psyche hospital after scaring his family too much. He also shared the basement with his younger brother, who also witnessed a lot of the events in the basement. After the older boy was put away the family had an exorcism for the house. There wasnt any evil man that performed rituals, dead bodies or that the house burnt down. There was a man that was a prime spirit but not what they made him to be in the movie. The family just moved out after the exorcism and the boy was eventually released from the hospital. Normally I dont mind when they change the story because they have to add more suspense but I guess what kinda got to me was that they said at the end that the house was rebuilt after the fire and well, the house never burnt down.

Maybe it has something to do with my adolescence when a girlfriend's father was a mortician and the embalming area was in the basement of their house feeding my paranoia and fantasies whenever I visited. Maybe it has to do with recently reading a horror storyThe Birthing House(one I didn't care for) where another Victorian house - isn't it always a Victorian era house - has fallen prey to possession predicated on the vile acts of previous owner, but now seems like a favorite son for another horror flick. Possibly, another recently read book,Johannes Cabal the Necromancerserved as a contributing factor. Whatever my specious motivations, in spite of familiarity with the documentary covering the same story, a spate of clich&eacute;d occurrences in the movie and the screenwriter's unfortunate decision  to use the ""This Old House"" exorcism as an exit strategy, as a escapist vehicle lasting just a little more than an 1   hours, it wasn't that bad.The two central characters, Sara Campbell, portrayed by Virginia Madsen, and her brain cancer stricken son, Matt (Kyle Gallner) are the most interesting and credible performances, although for someone living in a dwelling she has come to believe is haunted while confronted by a host of other highly stressful life situations, Madsen does periodically seem the corporeal manifestation of the saint to whom Mother Teresa might have prayed. Supporting cast members perform in a non-offensive but pedestrian manner but all probably did the best they could with the unchallenging roles presented to them, including Elias Koteas in the dual capacities of priest and Deus ex machina.The movie is relatively fast paced so although many of the scenes and CGI effects are not particularly innovative or original the story manages to hold the viewer's attention, even in the instances where your eyes roll to the back of your head.  Director Peter Cornwell uses flashbacks and artifact discoveries to reveal the explanations for the paranormal activities with mixed results.  As a result, the few gory interludes fail to reach the thresholds of scary... or disgusting, if slash and trash is a preference.

Dialogue was crisp and mixed well with the surrounding sounds and effects.  Bass response was also well used in this movie, great mix of rumbles, and hard hits just at the right scenes, make for some great moments.I don't wanna ruin the movie, so I wont give anything away.

Having said that, the jumps are done effectively enough, and in a dark room with surround sound and a big screen, I found it certainly creepy enough.Plot-wise.. a family have to move into a house, for their cancer stricken son to be near the hospital where he is being treated.  However, it is an ex funeral home, and their son starts to see things... So far, so Amityville.  The cast are given just enough fleshing out to be interesting, and if there is something routine about the story, there is also something satisfying about old fashioned shocks instead of non-stop torture as seems to now be de rigeur in horror movies.  There is a fair bit of cheap shocks using flash-cuts accompanied by dramatic chords, but for the most part this has been fairly well crafted with a decent score, served well by the blu-ray format.  It just won't win any awards for originality.  The `based-on-a-true-story' tag is given some credence by an interesting documentary accompanying the movie, which interviews most of the people portrayed in the movie.

1246486,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0021L8UFI,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[7, 10]","The Haunting in Connecticut (Peter Cornwell, 2009)The Haunting in Connecticut was, in the main, excoriate by the critics, and met with mixed reviews at best from the general community (IMDB rating of 5.8 as I write this). Well, as is often the case, allow me to be the voice of, depending on your point of view, either reason or insanity; The Haunting in Connecticut was the first horror movie I've seen on the big screen in seventeen years that actually kind of scared me. Since it's a horror movie, as far as I'm concerned, it's already got a pretty high rating on that fact alone. And, well, the rest of it ain't bad either. Not great, I grant you, but not bad.The plot (which is based on the supposedly-true case of Al and Carmen Snedeker) revolves around Matt Campbell (Veronica Mars's Kyle Gallner), a cancer patient who's being treated in Connecticut. It's a tough commute for his mother Sara (Virginia Madsen, in a welcome return to horror), so after some discussion with her husband (Martin Donovan), the family rents a house close to the hospital. Weird things start happening pretty much from the outset, and so Matt enlists the help of a fellow cancer sufferer, Rev. Popescu (Elias Koteas), to get rid of the ghosts. That turns out to be more difficult than expected, in no small part because Sara doesn't believe anything weird is going on until it's thrust in her face.I do understand some of the criticism in the movie, which is an unwise-at-best attempt to meld the atmosphere of an Asian horror film with the emotional claptrap of your basic Lifetime Original Movie (or, for that matter, most anything coming out of Hollywood these days). The dysfunctional-family angle is vastly overplayed throughout, and every one of the movie's flaws stems from it. That said, the atmosphere is brilliant, and if you grafted it onto a movie that wasn't trying to appeal to the Lifetime set, it'd be hailed as the best Hollywood horror film in ages. The movie keeps a constant feel of low-grade creepy, punctuated with a number of scares that really do work and a handful of plot twists, most of which work (there are two or three that are all too predictable, once again thanks to the dysfunctional-family angle).

1246488,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0021L8UFI,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 1]","**1/2Few genres are as fiercely wedded to their cliches as the haunted-house movie.  In each case, the house in question must come with its own horrific back-history to give the ghosts some reason to still be hanging around the property long after they should have shucked this mortal coil and gone off to their heavenly reward.  Then a group of unsuspecting innocents must move into the home just so they can be systematically terrorized, harassed and otherwise inconvenienced by all those troubled spirits who won't be able to rest until some grave injustice from the past is finally rectified by the current residents.  And, of course, there can't be anyone among the living to offer the perfectly practical suggestion that they all just hightail it away from the spot as quickly as possible, leaving the rude otherworldly creatures to their own devices.Rarely does the formula achieve the level of sophistication we find in ""The Innocents"" or ""The Haunting"" (the original one, anyway) or ""The Uninvited"" or ""Poltergeist"" or ""The Shining.""  More often than not, it winds up as a rehashed (and usually lesser) version of ""The Amityville Horror,"" some allegedly fact-based tale designed to dupe the gullible and unwary into forking over their hard-earned cash at the box office.  Unfortunately, ""The Haunting in Connecticut"" - which relates a series of events that ostensibly took place in 1987 - falls into the latter category.  Here we have a family who buys an old funeral parlor out in the country so that the oldest son, Matt (well played by Kyle Gallner), won't have to travel so far for his cancer treatments.  Yet, no sooner has the family moved in than mysterious figures are appearing in the mirrors, Matt is having quick-cut visions of gruesome events that occurred there in the past, and the soundtrack has gone into eardrum-bursting overdrive in an effort to gin up the suspense.I would like to be able to say that there is at least one original moment in ""The Haunting in Connecticut,"" but I would be lying if I did.  In fact, so familiar are the events in the story (it even has its requisite resident ghost-buster) and so conventional the filmmaking - replete with the standard cacophony of slamming doors, screeching demons and howling spirits - that, ""true"" story or not, it feels as if the moviemakers simply rolled a giant haunted-house movie template onto a table and began dutifully filling in all the slots with the required pieces.The only truly novel element in the story is the teen-cancer angle, and, indeed, there are a few touching moments dealing with the effect the disease is having not only on the boy himself but on his parents (Virginia Madsen, Martin Donavan) and siblings as well.  It makes one realize that ""The Haunting in Connecticut"" stood the chance of being a halfway decent film - if only we could have gotten rid of all those pesky ghosts!",2,just like every other haunted-house movie,1268697600,"03 16, 2010",2010,2885,"['**1/2Few', 'genres', 'are', 'fiercely', 'wedded', 'cliches', 'haunted-house', 'movie', 'case', 'house', 'question', 'must', 'come', 'own', 'horrific', 'back-history', 'give', 'ghosts', 'reason', 'still', 'be', 'hanging', 'property', 'long', 'should', 'have', 'shucked', 'mortal', 'coil', 'gone', 'off', 'heavenly', 'reward', 'Then', 'group', 'unsuspecting', 'innocents', 'must', 'move', 'home', 'just', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'systematically', 'terrorized', 'harassed', 'otherwise', 'inconvenienced', 'troubled', 'spirits', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'rest', 'grave', 'injustice', 'past', 'finally', 'rectified', 'current', 'residents', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'anyone', 'living', 'offer', 'perfectly', 'practical', 'suggestion', 'just', 'hightail', 'away', 'spot', 'as', 'quickly', 'possible', 'leaving', 'rude', 'otherworldly', 'own', 'devices.Rarely', 'formula', 'achieve', 'level', 'sophistication', 'find', 'Innocents', 'Haunting', 'original', 'one', 'anyway', 'Uninvited', 'Poltergeist', 'Shining', 'More', 'often', 'not', 'up', 'rehashed', 'usually', 'lesser', 'version', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'allegedly', 'fact-based', 'tale', 'designed', 'dupe', 'gullible', 'unwary', 'forking', 'over', 'hard-earned', 'cash', 'box', 'office', 'Unfortunately', 'Haunting', 'Connecticut', 'series', 'events', 'ostensibly', 'took', 'place', '1987', 'latter', 'category', 'Here', 'have', 'family', 'who', 'old', 'funeral', 'parlor', 'country', 'so', 'oldest', 'son', 'Matt', 'well', 'played', 'Kyle', 'Gallner', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'travel', 'so', 'far', 'cancer', 'treatments', 'sooner', 'family', 'moved', 'mysterious', 'figures', 'are', 'appearing', 'mirrors', 'Matt', 'having', 'quick-cut', 'visions', 'gruesome', 'events', 'occurred', 'past', 'soundtrack', 'gone', 'eardrum-bursting', 'overdrive', 'effort', 'gin', 'up', 'suspense.I', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'able', 'say', 'least', 'one', 'original', 'moment', 'Haunting', 'Connecticut', 'would', 'be', 'lying', 'did', 'fact', 'familiar', 'are', 'events', 'story', 'even', 'requisite', 'resident', 'ghost-buster', 'so', 'conventional', 'filmmaking', 'replete', 'standard', 'cacophony', 'slamming', 'doors', 'screeching', 'demons', 'howling', 'spirits', 'true', 'story', 'not', 'moviemakers', 'simply', 'rolled', 'giant', 'haunted-house', 'movie', 'template', 'table', 'began', 'dutifully', 'filling', 'slots', 'required', 'pieces.The', 'only', 'truly', 'novel', 'element', 'story', 'teen-cancer', 'angle', 'indeed', 'are', 'few', 'touching', 'moments', 'dealing', 'effect', 'disease', 'having', 'not', 'only', 'boy', 'parents', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'Martin', 'Donavan', 'siblings', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'realize', 'Haunting', 'Connecticut', 'stood', 'chance', 'being', 'halfway', 'decent', 'film', 'only', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'rid', 'pesky', 'ghosts']",N/A

O'Blenis,"[1, 1]","A large old house that used to be a funeral home serves as the setting for The Haunting In Connecticut, where the Campbell family moves to be closer to the hospital where their oldest son, Matt (Kyle Gallner) is receiving treatments for his cancer.  The rent for the place is unexpectedly cheap, and it's only after the family moves in that they realize that's because of the history of the place, its status as a former funeral home/mortuary, and the legends that have cropped up surrounding the place.  It seems that decades ago, it was used for seances, and the tale is that something went horribly wrong at one of these.Before the family even moves in, there's trouble, albeit of a more conventional nature.  The prognosis for Matt isn't that positive, the treatments he's undergoing are grueling, the family's finances are under severe stress from trying to pay for the treatments and support a household of six, including two younger siblings of Matt's - Billy and Mary - and their cousin Wendy (Amanda Crew fromSex Drive, who's living with the family due to an unspecified trouble in her own family.  The tension between the two parents, played by Virginia Madsen (fromCandyman (Special Edition)) and Martin Donovan, is present under a thin veil, and begins to surface more as conditions, both conventional and the dawning supernatural elements, mount.  Of the two, the mother is the more sympathetic, and while the conflict within the family isn't anything on the level of domestic abuse, the tension it creates folds right into the larger problems.  Also, unstated but implied, is the possibility that the forces in the house are 'drawing out' the darker, more volatile aspects in some of their personalities, in an Amityville-like fashion.  Ghostly elements within the house begin to manifest, primarily to Matt, and start taking on decidedly malevelont overtones.Matt establishes a friendship with a fellow cancer patient, a Reverend Popescu (Elias Koteas) , who he turns to as events continue to worsen.  The Reverend theorizes that these prescences are being triggered because they're more easily interacted with by someone already close to the other side - someone close to death, such as a cancer patient.  As events progress though, the phenomena become discernible to other family members, and more capable of effecting the physical world, often in violent ways.  In order to attempt to exorcise the house, the characters have to understand it, and the Reverend, along with Matt and Wendy, delve into the dark history of the house.Although slower-moving and more subdued than some horror movies, the pace and style doesn't hurt the movie, and indeed helps it to build its own distinct atmosphere of slowly mounting dread and in-the-shadows creepiness.  Very well-acted and well-produced, with the special effects, while minimal, being effective.  Much in the vein of movies likeThe Exorcism of Emily Rose - Unrated (Special Edition),The Amityville Horror(as well as its better sequels and the 2005 remake) andHaunted (Full Screen).  Although it may take a bit Too much time building up for some tastes, those who don't mind a subtler, more slow-building tone now and then will find this highly rewarding.A couple of lesser known films you might also want to check out if you like this one areRed Rover / Heritage De SangandPhone.",4,A Quality Entry In The Pantheon Of Ghostly Horror,1256688000,"10 28, 2009",2009,3346,"['large', 'old', 'house', 'used', 'be', 'funeral', 'home', 'serves', 'setting', 'Haunting', 'Connecticut', 'where', 'Campbell', 'family', 'moves', 'be', 'closer', 'hospital', 'where', 'oldest', 'son', 'Matt', 'Kyle', 'Gallner', 'receiving', 'treatments', 'cancer', 'rent', 'place', 'unexpectedly', 'cheap', 'only', 'family', 'realize', 'history', 'place', 'status', 'former', 'funeral', 'home/mortuary', 'legends', 'have', 'cropped', 'up', 'surrounding', 'place', 'decades', 'ago', 'was', 'used', 'seances', 'tale', 'something', 'went', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'one', 'these.Before', 'family', 'even', 'moves', 'trouble', 'albeit', 'more', 'conventional', 'nature', 'prognosis', 'Matt', ""n't"", 'that', 'positive', 'treatments', 'undergoing', 'are', 'grueling', 'family', 'finances', 'are', 'severe', 'stress', 'trying', 'pay', 'treatments', 'support', 'household', 'six', 'including', 'two', 'younger', 'siblings', 'Matt', 'Billy', 'Mary', 'cousin', 'Wendy', 'Amanda', 'Crew', 'fromSex', 'Drive', 'who', 'living', 'family', 'due', 'unspecified', 'trouble', 'own', 'family', 'tension', 'two', 'parents', 'played', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'fromCandyman', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Martin', 'Donovan', 'present', 'thin', 'veil', 'surface', 'more', 'conditions', 'conventional', 'dawning', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'mount', 'two', 'mother', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'conflict', 'family', ""n't"", 'anything', 'level', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'tension', 'folds', 'right', 'larger', 'problems', 'Also', 'unstated', 'implied', 'possibility', 'forces', 'house', 'are', ""'drawing"", 'out', 'darker', 'more', 'volatile', 'aspects', 'personalities', 'Amityville-like', 'fashion', 'Ghostly', 'elements', 'house', 'begin', 'manifest', 'primarily', 'Matt', 'start', 'taking', 'decidedly', 'malevelont', 'overtones.Matt', 'friendship', 'fellow', 'cancer', 'patient', 'Reverend', 'Popescu', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'who', 'events', 'continue', 'worsen', 'Reverend', 'prescences', 'are', 'being', 'triggered', ""'re"", 'more', 'easily', 'interacted', 'someone', 'already', 'close', 'other', 'side', 'someone', 'close', 'death', 'such', 'cancer', 'patient', 'events', 'phenomena', 'become', 'discernible', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'more', 'capable', 'effecting', 'physical', 'world', 'often', 'violent', 'ways', 'order', 'attempt', 'exorcise', 'house', 'characters', 'have', 'understand', 'Reverend', 'Matt', 'Wendy', 'delve', 'dark', 'history', 'house.Although', 'slower-moving', 'more', 'subdued', 'horror', 'movies', 'pace', 'style', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'movie', 'indeed', 'build', 'own', 'distinct', 'atmosphere', 'slowly', 'mounting', 'dread', 'in-the-shadows', 'creepiness', 'Very', 'well-acted', 'well-produced', 'special', 'effects', 'minimal', 'being', 'effective', 'Much', 'vein', 'movies', 'likeThe', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'Unrated', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'as', 'well', 'better', 'sequels', '2005', 'remake', 'andHaunted', 'Full', 'Screen', 'may', 'take', 'bit', 'Too', 'much', 'time', 'building', 'up', 'tastes', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'subtler', 'more', 'slow-building', 'tone', 'now', 'then', 'will', 'find', 'highly', 'rewarding.A', 'couple', 'lesser', 'known', 'films', 'might', 'also', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'like', 'one', 'areRed', 'Rover', '/', 'Heritage', 'De', 'SangandPhone']",N/A

The reviews on Rotten Tomatoes certainly were not among the best of the year, so I went in to this film with moderate expectations. Let's just say that I was mildly impressed.The film begins with a mother and her son, riding around Connecticut, and looking for a new home. The son has cancer which requires several treatments, and his mother wants the family to move closer to the hospital. She purchases the first house that's available. From the moment we see this place, we know that it's probably not the best idea. However, she makes an executive decision, and doesn't even think to scope it out beforehand.Almost immediately, the son starts having disturbing visions and nightmares. He moves into the lower half of the house, because it's spacious, and he thinks it looks cool. Big mistake. That's when things start to get intense. The use of atmosphere is probably the finest element in the film. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the acting or the direction. The herky-jerky style of editing gets annoying after a while, and at times the film seems unfocused. There were a few scenes that made little or no sense at all within the context of the story. The acting was mild, to say the least. Virginia Madsen portrays the mother, and she's the only one who manages to show the least bit of range. Also, the film is very derivative of other haunted house films, and anyone who has seen THE OTHERS, THE SHINING, or THE AMITYVILLE HORROR will know exactly what I am talking about.The film manages to pack in quite a few scares, and since I scare easily, it got to me.

A family - mother, two sons (older one has cancer, but we aren't told of what), and two nieces move into a big old house that used to be a ""funeral parlor.""  The dad stays in their other house and comes for the weekends. This rent house is closer to the hospital to take the son for experimental treatment. As soon as they move in, the son, Matt, starts seeing things, which of course, no one else sees(until later). But this has to be a secret, because if he sees things (hallucinates) he will get kicked out of the experimental drug treatment program.Don't read further if you have not seen the movie. The background of the house is that the funeral director or whatever, took pictures of the dead people. The new tenants found a lot of photos under the floorboards in the attic. He put the bodies on the tables to embalm them, but did he embalm them? He also had a kid, Jonah watching him. On the cover of the DVD it says he is the ""owner's"" son, but in the movie, it didn't say that. He was his assistant. Jonah was clairvoyant, and this guy wanted him there watching him work, why, we don't know. So...he would carve weird letters over every inch of these people's bodies, then cut their eyelids off, so that their eyes would always be open. A reverend that Matt meets, later says this is so that they could be watchmen for him, then he changes his mind and says it's so that they can't be seen. Huh? The reason he writes all over these people is so that it would ""bind their spirits to their bodies."" And what was the point of that? Then he would wrap them up like mummies and hide their bodies. Throw sand bags into coffins and bury them. When the cemetery was dug up, to relocate the bodies due to a highway expansion, the bodies were of course not there. The funeral director/mortician also liked to have seances, where people would come to talk to their deceased loved ones. Then Jonah, as the medium, would freak out, and ectoplasm (which looked like some shiny mylar stuff, but was supposed to be gel) would come out of his mouth. One time it caught on fire, and everybody at the seance died, except him. He then got himself stuck in the house, where he died. So all these dead people were not happy and driving the kid with cancer, Matt, crazy, with horrible visions of blood, tarantulas and other gross stuff. Matt turns into Jonah, and finds all the dead people's bodies, throws some old leftover bottles of formaldehyde on them, and sets the place on fire. This was so ""Jonah"" could set them ""free.""Everything is happy happy after that, Matt is cancer-free, the house is rebuilt (from whose insurance?)and the Mom is shown being filmed for a documentary.But why would anybody want to bind spirits to bodies? And why would that work? Because when you die, your spirit leaves your body. It doesn't wait around to be embalmed and have characters carved into the skin and eyelids cut off. Why did this guy have seances? To rip people off?

The plot is well paced, without the rubbishey `its just the cat moments' or prolonged character development that doesn't help us like the characters at all and the special effects and settings are creepy as they should be.Speaking of character development, Haunting in Connecticut is a step above most. Our main character Matt is a teenage cancer sufferer, which puts an interesting twist on the supernatural activity as hallucinations are potential side effects of his experimental treatment or cancer spreading to his brain. Matt's father is a recovering alcoholic which also adds tension to the story (although to be honest is only tokeniscally explored)Of course, this movie isn't perfect. While well executed the plot is entirely derivative - almost arbitrary. A (somewhat) nuclear family moves into a house which is extra cheap because of its `history'. Strange events start to ensue, and once the family accepts that something supernatural is going on, research is conducted at the local library where-upon it is discovered that a creepy old guy used to conduct necromonic experiments in their basement and a priest is called upon to help.While the scares are well timed, they get a little repetitive - essentially all being bogeyman suddenly appearing coupled with atonal violin screeches. And as mentioned before the plot doesn't build beyond the well-known old man experimenter theme (although they play a bit of `just whose ghost is haunting us?')Overall Haunting in Connecticut is probably just a good typical horror for a couple of hours of non-thinking time, don't expect the wheel to get reinvented.",4,"Nothing new, but well done",1275868800,"06 7, 2010",2010,1739,"['Haunting', 'Connecticut', 'decent', 'horror', 'flick', 'given', 'horror', 'films', 'are', 'mostly', 'abject', 'tripe', 'saying', 'lot', 'plot', 'well', 'paced', 'rubbishey', 'just', 'cat', 'moments', 'prolonged', 'character', 'development', ""n't"", 'help', 'characters', 'special', 'effects', 'settings', 'are', 'creepy', 'should', 'be.Speaking', 'character', 'development', 'Haunting', 'Connecticut', 'step', 'most', 'main', 'character', 'Matt', 'teenage', 'cancer', 'sufferer', 'interesting', 'twist', 'supernatural', 'activity', 'hallucinations', 'are', 'potential', 'side', 'effects', 'experimental', 'treatment', 'cancer', 'spreading', 'brain', 'Matt', 'father', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'also', 'tension', 'story', 'be', 'honest', 'only', 'tokeniscally', 'explored', 'course', 'movie', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'well', 'executed', 'plot', 'entirely', 'derivative', 'almost', 'arbitrary', 'somewhat', 'nuclear', 'family', 'house', 'extra', 'cheap', 'history', 'Strange', 'events', 'start', 'ensue', 'once', 'family', 'something', 'supernatural', 'going', 'research', 'conducted', 'local', 'library', 'where-upon', 'discovered', 'creepy', 'old', 'guy', 'used', 'conduct', 'necromonic', 'experiments', 'basement', 'priest', 'called', 'help.While', 'scares', 'are', 'well', 'timed', 'get', 'little', 'repetitive', 'essentially', 'being', 'bogeyman', 'suddenly', 'appearing', 'coupled', 'atonal', 'violin', 'screeches', 'mentioned', 'plot', ""n't"", 'build', 'well-known', 'old', 'man', 'experimenter', 'theme', 'play', 'bit', 'just', 'ghost', 'haunting', 'Overall', 'Haunting', 'Connecticut', 'probably', 'just', 'good', 'typical', 'horror', 'couple', 'hours', 'non-thinking', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'wheel', 'get', 'reinvented']",N/A

And those weird things they find in the damp basement, or the spooky things they see in the dimly-lit bedroom, are all related to the past of the house, usually something evil.You know, the idea of haunted house has been used in horror films, but except some masterpieces (like Robert Wise's ""The Haunting"" or more recently Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar's ""The Others""), the end result tends to be formulaic and even predictable.  Though it is well-acted and not exactly predictable, ""The Haunting in Connecticut"" uses too many familiar tricks to really scare the viewers.The story if the film directed by feature first-timer Peter Cornwell is about Sara Campbell (Virginia Madsen) and her son with cancer Matt (Kyle Gallner). For the health of the ailing son, the family is relocated to a house where they experience disturbing things.The biggest problem of ""The Haunting in Connecticut"" is that whenever the film attempts to scare us, it tends to rely on such old tricks as sudden appearance of something (sometimes accompanied by sound effects), or familiar plot devices. The film has moments - those photos and the basement are creepy and crisp cinematography is first-rate - and actors are all wonderful, with outstanding Elias Koteas as the reverend with cancer, but the film runs out of steam before its concluding chapters.Finally, ""The Haunting in Connecticut"" claims that ""it is based on truth,"" and I read in IMDb that the film is `based on the story featured in the Discovery Channel documentary ""A Haunting in Connecticut,""' which I haven't seen.

1246506,AN7TIQWIXAQ79,B0021L8UFI,W. Goring,"[0, 1]","According to the logline for `The Haunting In Connecticut' some things just can't be explain. Well in the course of this film its makers dam well try to explain everything, obliterating any chance the film has of being genuinely scary.While the story is quite good and apparently based on fact, the way in which it is presented to us as a film works completely against the idea of reality and truth. Rapid cuts, flashes of ghostly figures, sharp stings of music to highlight moments that are intended to be frightening (these are the canned laughter of horror movies) are all very redundant, as the crux of the story is already quite terrifying. A boy with cancer, close to death himself, becomes a magnet for ill-at-ease spectres in an old Connecticut home. This film falls folly to the same temptations faced by many modern horror tales, when filmmakers, producers and studios are afraid to take time to tell their story, build gradually to a climax and let the viewers mind imagine how terrifying the situation presented can be. What disappointed me most of all about this film was the over visualising of the boy's ghostly visions. They just seemed too detailed and specific, even logical. The filmmakers seemingly forgot that the epicentre of fear is the unknown and unexplainable. Here everything is given a reason and the characters seem to understand exactly who the ghosts are, where they came from and what they want. So the film's ominous logline is actually a lie. To be fair, this film is a cut above most recent horror fare despite its short comings. What works about the film rides almost solely on the performance of Kyle Gallner as Matt, the boy at the centre of all this ghostly attention. Gallner has gone on to appear in Jennifer's Body and the Nightmare On Elm St. remake, and I'm sure landed those subsequent horror roles because of his turn in this film. If only the same could be said for the seasoned performers that surround him. Virginia Madsen as his mother, Martin Donovan as his father and Elias Koteas as a priest also stricken with cancer, all seem to struggle abit. Unlike Gallner, their performances didn't seem very real. I know these actors can be good, so I'm putting it down to direction, sorry Peter Cornwell. It's funny. Recently I've been watching a series on Discovery call `A Haunting'. Each episode concerns a real haunting and how people deal with the supernatural.

1246507,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B0021L8UFI,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[2, 2]","I am quite familiar with the Discovery channel documentary that has supposedly inspired this film by Peter Cornwell. The documentary ""Haunting in Connecticut"" chronicles the experiences of the Snedeker family during their stay in a certain house that was formerly a mortuary. So where is this story? I'll get right to the point, if you are expecting a dramatization or an accurate portrayal about the true events experienced by the Snedeker family; you are in for a huge disappointment. Peter Cornwell's ""Haunting in Connecticut"" is a film VERY loosely based off the true events and is your usual Hollywood serving of a horror film which offers nothing really compelling. Thank goodness the ensemble cast managed to pull together to carry the film's burden.Now renamed the ""Campbells"" in this film, Sarah (Virginia Madsen) and Peter (Martin Donovan) are struggling to make ends meet as they try to keep their son Matt (Kyle Gallner) as close to his designated cancer clinic as much as possible. Sarah makes the step to rent a rundown house that was once a funeral home, a house with a past is something they could afford while paying their other existing mortgage so they can make the best of a difficult situation. The entire family moves in to try to adjust to Matt's ailment. But now Matt begins to experience hallucinations as he sees shadowy figures that haunt him almost relentlessly. Matt seeks assistance from a fellow cancer patient, Rev. Popescu (Elias Koteas) who tries to makes sense of the house's macabre signs and horrific past...As a film based off true events, ""Haunting in Connecticut"" feels rather insubstantial. The film borrows elements from ""Amityville Horror"", ""Momento Mori"" and even ""Poltergeist"" all the while using the experiences of the Snedeker's experiences as a mere backdrop. The film's references to the original documentary are very light, and merely utilize them only as some sort of a theme. The film uses the usual cheap scares and ""jump"" gimmicks to generate some thrills, which makes for a very clich&eacute;d film. The film does somewhat exude an eerie atmosphere and the set designs are rather nice. It is all well and acceptable but not entirely impressive--it does have a stylish approach to its proceedings visually speaking.I guess the problems with ""Haunting in Connecticut"" begin when it pitches clich&eacute;d elements to try to explain what went on in the house's past so that Cornwell could attempt to create a compelling horror film. The film should've done better if it focused more on the family; their money problems, a strong-willed woman who has to contend with a sober husband who had fallen off the wagon, and the actual effects of the haunting itself on the family. I wasn't given enough time to become attached to the characters, and instead the screenplay tries to indulge the viewer with cheap scares and the usual shadowy ghosts to keep things interesting. I also found some aspects of the haunting seem like a throw-away details and when the direction tries to make sense of its narrative, this is when it falters.Not that the film had a weak storyline and its does set the needed groundwork, but when it does reveal the actual mystery at its core, it all felt too routine and not at all gripping. Gone are the investigations by renown paranormal scientists, the scene where the family stayed together in the living room and advised not to move out, the church's involvement and the exorcism scene that were essential parts of the documentary. Instead we get ectoplasmic vomit, sliced eyelids, pictures of the dead and a dark back story. So again, where are the hardships of the family in dealing with the supernatural? I highly doubt that any of these plot elements were actually based on truth and the film feels really based off guesswork as the actual interviews of the real family (in the dvd's special features) even somewhat confirm that the film's narrative is mostly fictional.Thankfully the cast does manage to pull off some good performances. The mother played by Virginia Madsen has that sort of gutsy quality that was rather refreshing; it is always good to see a strong woman determined to save her son that for me, it generated some sympathy. Kyle Gallner is actually decent as Matt Campbell, you can see the sadness, grief, fear, confusion in his eyes. Elias Koteas' character feels rather stereotypical but I enjoyed the way he portrayed his character. The rest of the cast is pretty ok, and the little girl is just so charming.""Haunting in Connecticut"" may mildly raise heart rates, and may even offer a few freaky images but they are all something we've seen before. There's just hardly any feeling of nail-biting suspense, which is no fault of its cast but it was just the way the film was bombastically laid out. I thought I wasn't allowed much time to settle in and without proper development of the events, the film lost dramatic significance. One thing, I have to say, if the movie wasn't improperly marketed as based off well-known events (as documented by the Discovery channel), I may have liked it a little more for a PG-13 horror movie. The film is stylish, and at least it isn't another remake.Rent it [2  Stars=Fair]The unrated cut has quick snippets of graphic autopsy footage and the eyelid scenes; it is still pretty much a PG-13

1246508,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0021L8UFI,Z Hayes,"[14, 18]","I was eager to check this movie out because I really liked the docudrama ""A Haunting in Connecticut"" which was part of a series titled ""Haunting"" by the Discovery Channel. This movie was supposedly inspired by those true events. In the docudrama, Karen and Ed Parker and their family move into an old home in Connecticut, not realising the house harbors entities that are far from benign.The most affected is the couple's 14-year-old son, Paul, who seems to be most susceptible to the hauntings. In desperation, the family contacts Edward and Lorraine Warren, the same people who investigated another famous haunted house that became known as ""The Amityville Horror"".In the movie version, the story remains true to the original to some extent. Virginia Madsen plays Sara Campbell, whose teenage son Matt [Kyle Gallner] is suffering from some form of brain cancer. The treatment requires them to make a long commute and to cut on the travel time, Sara decides to lease a house close by to the hospital. She finds an old house for cheap [the family already has money problems] and finds out it used to serve a darker purpose than a residence. The family moves in anyway, and straight away Matt begins seeing things and hearing noises. He moves into the basement which has a sealed off room. Upon finally opening it, Matt discovers what the house used to be - a mortuary and funeral home. Soon, the rest of the family begins to see and hear strange things and Matt together with Wendy [Amanda Crew] investigate the history of the house, discovering some truly horrific facts about the house's dark past, having to do with death, necrophilia,missing bodies and a horrific tragedy.The movie is actually well-paced - I did not find the pace plodding nor boring. There is no gore or over-the-top special effects here. In many ways, this movie reminded me of The Amityville Horror II with the son of the house being the focus of the hauntings. Some scenes were scary, especially the flashbacks to the past involving incidents of necrophilia. The acting was ok, not great, but Kyle Gallner was quite credible in his role.What disappointed me was the omission of two central characters in the movie - they did not include the Warrens in the movie, who played a significant role in the actual case. Instead, the movie shows a priest, Reverend Popescu [Elias Koteas] as the person the family turns to for help. His acting was not very impressive in this movie. Once again, I felt the priest role here was reminiscent of the one portrayed in The Amityville Horror.Conclusion - for those who love the horror genre, this movie does not really bring anything new to the table. The acting and effects are decent enough, and I did find myself entertained.
