The set decorations were well done and the film, for the most part, seamlessly blended set locations with the CGI locations.  The actors all did a fine job.  I fail to understand why so many dislike this film.The story, while familiar to many, was still suspenseful and moved at a good pace.  It's not an action film and so those expecting non-stop action may be disappointed.  Still there is action and great special effects.  Time travel is such an interesting concept and is something that most people have day dreamed about at one time or another.  I'm sure there are things we all wish we could go back and change.  The Morlock's are great and terrifying enemies.Of course there are some nitpicks to be had.  Will people still be speaking English 800,000 years from now?  Unlikely!  Could a computer still be running and functioning 800,000 years from now?  I can't imagine how!!!  Finally, given the way the geography changed over 800,000 years, which was well visualized by CGI, is it likely that the Time Machine would not emerge buried underground or underwater?  I didn't find it at all credible that the Time Machine, which does not move physical but only through time, would materialize on the surface after so many millennia.Still, this movie tells a good story and IMO is well worth watching.  It may be a little scary for children under the age of ten years but in general is a good family film.

To literally tranlate Wells onto film won't work. he's too dated And to Pal fans it is heresy to say someone can do as well. I, personally, never thought much of the Pal version. Okay for it's time but not all that spectacular.But this is a film only based on Well's story. Not limited to it. Just like the movie War of the Worlds was only based on WellsThis film has charm all it's own. The musical score is interesting enough to buy the cd. And the CGI effects are understated so they don't overwhelm the story. I would have fleshed out the story more. Perhaps a half hour more. If there is a valid complaint , it might be that Well's social commentary doesn't come through very well. But by creating the charactor of the &quot;uberMorlock&quot; (played interestingly enough by Jeremy Irons) the director gets to slip a bit of his own social commentary about the world changing and how we deal with it. Watch for the typical American reaction to change. That which offends us, we blow up. I will have to say that Samantha Mumba makes a refreshing change from Yvette Minieux who I have never liked in any part.

Okay, I was wrong.  Even though The Time Machine (2002) can't use its 22.5 million first weekend gross to spend on rave reviews, it does have a spark of adventure and I did feel the gray sky encroaching in the latter hour.  A+ for effort and the time spinning effects were marvelous!  Guy Pearce has already proven (LA Confidential, Memento) that his earnest histrionics were worth the big ticket and this time conveys his ability to be the unarchetypical male hero; exchanging gun-totin', foul mouthed witticisms for slick intellect and a cappuccino frothin' time ride.  Jeremy Irons plays a terrifically terrifying Morlock lord who obviously wasn't very hungry and feeling mucho catty to let a tasty morsel like Alexander walk.  If you've read HG Wells book of the same name then the story will have you reminiscing.  If you haven't then perhaps you may wonder what kind of web could spin such an unbelievable tale!  This movie might score a B- in some skeptics corners; but I doubt it.  Take the kids -- it is a well guarded PG-13 and the only suggestive moments are when Ms. Mumba makes a bad wardrobe call and one intense moment that proved:  you cannot change the past but can make earnest effort to enhance the opposite.  It'll scare the little ones and evoke imagination in the bigger ones.

Wells nut so I thought what the heck. I was extremely surprised how much I enjoyed it. It wasn't perfect but it had so many things to like that I would most sincerely recommend it.Probably the weakest aspect of this movie is the plot. It's not bad but average at best. It follows the book relatively so, although they made the time traveler's purpose much more compelling. We're taken step-by-step through his tragedies to his travels into the past and future. The movie doesn't really hit it's stride until about the half-way mark when we're introduced to the Eloi, a race of humans 800,000 years in the future. The pace begins to build to a exiting but predictable climax.What makes this movie a must see is the way it was put together. The cast is first rate. Guy Pierce plays a lost but dedicated scientist wonderfully well. Samantha Mumba deserves credit for her performance, considering this was her first major picture role. Jeremy Irons is just excellent in a limited role as the ultimate ""villian."" His portrayal of the uber-Morlock could have been just a straight forward ""I'm-evil-and-you're-not"" villian but instead we're treated to a very complex character. Both likable and detestable. Orlando Jones plays a computer-generated figure who somehow has survived all the years, first meeting the traveler in the year 2030, then again after 800,000 years. Although the concept is a little weak Jones' characher is necessary to bring the good Dr. (and us) up to date. It was an neat addition.The very best part of this was the music. The Klaus Badelt score was awesome at the very least. He has the talent to capture the mood without overpowering the scene. His soundtrack coupled with Simon Wells beautiful vison makes for a great experience. Also the very last scene showing characters in two different times showed real imagination.I would recommend this movie to anyone who goes to the theater to escape.

588252,A1YC9XEDFKXPLK,B00005JKLZ,Armando M. Mesa,"[0, 0]","At best, Time Machine was a worthwhile Saturday watch. The effects were top rate and very convincing worthy of even George Lucas' ILM stamp of approval (althought the f/x were done by another company).As a previous viewer commented, it was painful to watch Guy Pearce's performance in some scenes. He either displayed ""wooden emotions"" or he tried a bit too hard. Also, his appearance looked gaunt and very tired in the first 30 to 40 minutes of the film. The ending or fading out of the film had a sort of Titanic feel with overlapping the past and future together in one particular melancholy scene. Despite the advances in special effects over the past 40 years since the original, the 1960 version will always be the best and is definitely a classic. In addition, the 1960 release produced some very grotesque and terrifying images with regards to the underground dwellers (the Morlocks; who can forget their yellow glowing eyes and savage growls)! However, what was admirable in the new version was the introduction of actor Jeremy Irons' intellectually sinister character role ! To hear him say his lines was like hearing his voice all over again from The Lion King playing the evil Scar. Showing that although the human future race was near extinction the existence of a multi-ethnic population was still possible (unlike the original). What I kept yearning for was more adventuresome exploring by the time traveller before he would finally advance to 800,000 years into the future.

Still, I didn't feel the script had anything important to say and left H.G.'s debate about utopia and free will totally out of it -- which seems to be a disservice to the author -- particularly surprising from a descendant considering how important H.G. considered it.

Sci fi is not about special effects, it is about thinking about things in a different way.  This movie failed to do that and seemed more like a forced Pollitical Correctness preach peppered with a monster head-bashing fest for distraction much like every other movie these days.  So really your just counter dictiong what H. G. Well's original story was all about.  Our minds and indeed our crainiums have shrunk in recent years(as medical profiles and IQ tests will show it's a fact) Generation Y is less intelligent(by a margin) than Gen X and so on and thier attention spans is considerably less. Just as Wells predicted. Gen Z(or whatever) will move even closer to the Eloi, which in the book are portraid as pretty weak and dumb(with no common sense either).  though most people couldn't handle that in a movie like this.H. G.'s grandson must have a rebellious streak. With this movie the Drama was severely lacking as well sci-fi being totally out of the picture period.  The characters were believable but uninspiring.  I don't think the &quot;Time Traveler&quot; should take responsiblity for everything, like the Samantha Mumba character(Weena equivilent) and all the eloi keep preaching to him.

Defying the ""Order of Things"", he builds a time machine in a vain attempt to change the past and save his beloved. When he discovers he is unable to alter what has already happened he flees into the future in search of the reason why events must remain as they are.What he discovers is a world in the aftermath of cataclysmic destruction where two distinct races, one living above the ground, the other below, have evolved from the ruin.  While this brave new world initially appears to be a New Eden he soon discovers that the old law of survival of the fittest still rules. Will Alexander finally uncover the answer to his question and learn to live once again and can one man from the distant past make a difference in this brave new world? Only time will tell.Critique: I must say I was surprised, no more like stunned. to see that the average rating for the '02 remake `The Time Machine' is only -3 Stars-. OK, I can understand and appreciate the H.G.

So, I purchased this remake some time ago and finally got to watching it because I kept thinking how can anyone mess with perfection (the original).  I found this remake surprisingly good!  Whereas many if not most redone movies try desperately to imitate an already hugely successful film; in this case The Time Machine remake branched out on its own and turned it way more science fiction than the original.  Don't get me wrong.  The original movie was way better but this one is still quite provocative in it's own right.  The original was easy to understand, really clear and straightforward.  This remake I will definitely watch again soon because there were many things I'd like to reexamine like for instance when he sees himself as this horrid creature later in time and they have a battle with each other!  This added a particularly odd twist.  I have watched the original many times over and will continue to do so; this movie I will watch more times, too.  I LOVED the ending of this film; it brought all the pieces together.  I also thought the switch up with the girlfriend getting murdered early on and then trying to save her as the concept as to why he made a time machine to begin with and what all happens with that angle was quite interesting.

I'm now very glad that I veiwed The Time Machine and would recommend it to anyone.ACTING: Suprisingly good. Guy Pearce gives a convinvcing performance Alexander Hardtgen, a professor who builds a time machine in order to go back and save a loved one who died. Samantha Mumba, the semi-famous popstar, actually was decent at Mara, and girl living in the future and trying to take care of her younger brother.PLOT: Very gripping, yet short and sweet, this movie speeds up after the first few minutes and really sports some interesting concepts. Original and something you'll have to see twice.SPECIAL EFFECTS: The SFX, by Digital Domain, are wonderful and create some of the most amazing effects seqences ever when Alex travels millions of years into the future while in his time machine. Beautiful and realistic.SCORE(MUSIC): Beautifully done and original. The music, infused with breathtaking tribal chants at times, is of a high standard and memorable.SPECIAL FEATURES: Very good for a single disc DVD, there are some interesting &quot;making of&quot; featurettes along with a wonderful segment about how Digital Domain created several effects sequences.

Which really pertains not at all to this Simon Wells adaptation of his great-grandfather's classic story.  But because I thought the 1960 Rod Taylororiginalwas totally lame, I had flatline expectations of the 2002 version of THE TIME MACHINE.  And you know what?  This one's lame, too, but much more fun to watch.The main reason this version looks better is due to CGI done quite well.  It certainly has nothing to do with a dull, wooden Guy Pearce as protagonist Alexander Hartdegen--an instructor consumed with gadgets and machinery and marathon math equations who builds a time machine to go back in time to save the violent death of his betrothed (Sienna Guillory).  Yet once he realizes the futility of his intervention (his betrothed was going to die, one way or another, on that fateful night), he decides to explore the future--only to bang his head in 2037 because pieces of the moon are crashing into Earth and, quite unconscious mind you, flings himself some 800,000 years into the future.  From there, we're treated to the customary confrontation between the Eloi and the Morlocks, interspersed with Orlando Jones as an informational hologram (really lame), a stunning Samantha Mumba (wolf howl), and a smug Jeremy Irons in white makeup and predictable villain mode.  The fight Irons has with Pearce aboard the time machine is a howler, yet still fun to watch.It's the special effects that save THE TIME MACHINE from DVD coaster status.  They're crisp, clear, vivid, impressive, and wondrous to behold; plus the blended scenes ending--with Pearce and Mumba in one half of the shot exploring their new future while the other half depicts two characters in 1903 standing on the exact same spot speculating what's become of Professor Hartdegen--is a grand way to end the visuals.  THE TIME MACHINE ultimately is silly and nonsensical, but the special effects at least make the nonsense palatable.--D.

Normally, I'm quite laid back with my reviews, but having seen the original version of this film with Rod Taylor, I was uneasily awaiting the release of this version.  Bypassing the fact that Guy Pearce nowhere near fits the lead role, I also found the history and fleshing out of the plot to be greatly lacking.  Had I not seen the original, I'd have been lost for the lack of plot.  In addition to a poor plot, there are many logical holes in the story that are ridiculously overlooked, as if the audience is too dumb to catch on.  The DVD itself is pretty poorly set up.

The amount of tampering done here definitely requires an explanation of intent.  Obviously, they had no intention of being faithful to the novel or the 1960 film adaptation of it.  Besides the changing of names and places, not to mention an entire race of beings, they altered the outcome of the story, making one wonder why they even bothered to keep the title and its association with Wells.  (They can mention from now until doomsday that the great-grandson of Wells&#8217; directed this movie, sacrilege is still sacrilege whether done by a stranger or a family member.)Taken as is, we have a renamed hero (Guy Pearce) given to rants about men in bowler hats when he isn&#8217;t playing at being the quintessential absent-minded professor.  He lives in a palatial home (on a professor&#8217;s salary?) packed with too many unnecessary props that have absolutely no bearing on the story at hand.  His trip into the future borders on lazy, especially considering he has speed dials at his disposal.  When he finally settles in the future, the greatest departure from the book and subsequent film takes place.

588287,A3L2U581LL17EB,B00005JKLZ,Eric,"[2, 3]","The Time Machine caught a lot of flack from critics, most of them finding it a silly, needless remake of a sci-fi classic.  And while I agree with some of their complaints, by the end, The TIme Machine successfully (though certainly not completely) won me over with its mix of awe-inspiring sci-fi and tense adventure.Guy Pearce stars as Alexander Hartdegen, a mathematics professor in the late 19th century who's just about to propose to his beautiful fiancee (Sienna Gullory).  But on the night, he proposes to her, she's shot and killed by a mugger.  Distraught, Hartdegen spends the next four years building a time machine so he can return to the very night she died.  But when he does go back in time, the results are the same.  She survives the mugger, but is killed in an even more horrific manner.Grief-stricken once again, Hartdegen comes to the conclusion she will always die no matter how he tries to save her.  Not knowing why, he believes the answer is in the future, which ultimately propels him 800,000 years to the future, where technology no longer exists and humanity's fate is more terrifying than Hartedgen could have imagined.There's a lot to like in The Time Machine.  Despite a somewhat stilted beginning that belongs more in a romantic comedy, once the time traveling begins, the film only engages more and more momentum as it moves along.  The subplots that are added here and there (most particularly how the moon was destroyed) are fascinating, each one capable of making another film entirely out of such ideas.And it seems there lies the major problem.  The film is extremely rushed.  In what it should have been an intriguing, tense, and perhaps somewhat leisurely paced adventure turns out to be a short (albeit fast-paced) 96-minute ride.  Director Simon Wells should have spent a bit more time exploring each of the future worlds Hartdegen visited, rather than simply giving us brief teases.The film has other problems, much of it pertaining to logic (and not logic applied to time travel, which would be pretty lame to complain about, since it would make the entire notion impossible).  I'd rather not give anything away, so I'll give a spoiler warning here.  There's a scene where Hartdegen meets the head Morlock (the people living underground), played by Jeremy Irons.  This morlock happens to be telepathic, but Hartdegen manages to trick him anyway.  Then there's the finale, which somehow features Hartdegen and his female companion climbing up a rather tall cliff in a matter of seconds, when it really would have taken at least half-an-hour to do so.But there are enough winning elements to make this a successful film.  As far as science fiction goes, The Time Machine is occasionally awe-inspiring, particularly in two amazing time traveling sequences that showcase eye-popping special effects as the world quickly changes around Hartdegen as he views, like us, with a transfixed fascination.Though some people I know didn't quite like the film's 800,000 year jump in the future, it made for quite a few standout scenes (particularly Pearce's first sight of the Eloi village and later on, his conversation with Irons' character).  The film also boasts some energetic action sequences, which are actually quite tense and well-directed, especially the morlock hunt (a sequence that would probably frighten younger children).  There's a particularly exhilarating scene where Hartdegen tries to fight a huge morlock single-handedly, and is speedily chased by the creature through the forest and up a wooden tower.As far as performances go, Guy Pearce is quite good as Hartdegen, delivering yet again another memorable turn.  Pearce makes this character convincing as both a nerdy scientist and as a physically-capable action hero, no small feat there.  Samantha Mumba makes little impression as Pearce's sort-of love interest, coming across a little flat.  Admittedly, her good figure kind of took my attention from her acting for a few moments.  Jeremy Irons is a standout as the uber-morlock, completely creepy and somehow both over-the-top and restrained at the same time.It's unfortunate The Time Machine isn't all it could have been (these days, that seems to apply to most big-budget studio films), but it's nice to see an inspired and spirited sci-fi adventure that's entertaining.  I like good science fiction, and if you're willing to accept some of this film's flaws, you'll probably enjoy this film, too.*** 1/2 out of *****",4,"Silly and rushed, but highly enjoyable.",1032480000,"09 20, 2002",2002,4475,"['Time', 'Machine', 'caught', 'lot', 'flack', 'critics', 'most', 'finding', 'silly', 'needless', 'remake', 'sci-fi', 'classic', 'agree', 'complaints', 'end', 'TIme', 'Machine', 'successfully', 'certainly', 'not', 'completely', 'won', 'over', 'mix', 'awe-inspiring', 'sci-fi', 'tense', 'adventure.Guy', 'Pearce', 'Alexander', 'Hartdegen', 'mathematics', 'professor', 'late', '19th', 'century', 'who', 'just', 'about', 'propose', 'beautiful', 'fiancee', 'Sienna', 'Gullory', 'night', 'shot', 'killed', 'mugger', 'Distraught', 'Hartdegen', 'next', 'four', 'years', 'building', 'time', 'machine', 'can', 'return', 'very', 'night', 'died', 'when', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'results', 'are', 'same', 'mugger', 'killed', 'even', 'more', 'horrific', 'manner.Grief-stricken', 'once', 'again', 'Hartdegen', 'conclusion', 'will', 'always', 'die', 'matter', 'how', 'save', 'Not', 'knowing', 'why', 'answer', 'future', 'ultimately', 'propels', '800,000', 'years', 'future', 'where', 'technology', 'no', 'longer', 'exists', 'humanity', 'fate', 'more', 'terrifying', 'Hartedgen', 'could', 'have', 'lot', 'like', 'Time', 'Machine', 'somewhat', 'stilted', 'beginning', 'more', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'once', 'time', 'traveling', 'begins', 'film', 'only', 'more', 'more', 'momentum', 'along', 'subplots', 'are', 'added', 'here', 'there', 'most', 'particularly', 'how', 'moon', 'was', 'destroyed', 'are', 'fascinating', 'one', 'capable', 'making', 'film', 'entirely', 'such', 'ideas.And', 'major', 'problem', 'film', 'extremely', 'rushed', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'intriguing', 'tense', 'perhaps', 'somewhat', 'leisurely', 'paced', 'adventure', 'out', 'be', 'short', 'fast-paced', '96-minute', 'ride', 'Director', 'Simon', 'Wells', 'should', 'have', 'spent', 'bit', 'more', 'time', 'exploring', 'future', 'Hartdegen', 'visited', 'rather', 'simply', 'giving', 'brief', 'teases.The', 'film', 'other', 'problems', 'much', 'pertaining', 'logic', 'not', 'logic', 'applied', 'time', 'travel', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'lame', 'complain', 'would', 'make', 'entire', 'notion', 'impossible', ""'d"", 'rather', 'not', 'give', 'anything', 'away', ""'ll"", 'give', 'spoiler', 'warning', 'here', 'scene', 'where', 'Hartdegen', 'head', 'Morlock', 'people', 'living', 'underground', 'played', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'morlock', 'be', 'telepathic', 'Hartdegen', 'trick', 'anyway', 'Then', 'finale', 'somehow', 'features', 'Hartdegen', 'female', 'companion', 'climbing', 'up', 'rather', 'tall', 'cliff', 'matter', 'seconds', 'when', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'least', 'half-an-hour', 'do', 'so.But', 'are', 'enough', 'winning', 'elements', 'make', 'successful', 'film', 'As', 'far', 'science', 'fiction', 'Time', 'Machine', 'occasionally', 'awe-inspiring', 'particularly', 'two', 'amazing', 'time', 'traveling', 'sequences', 'showcase', 'eye-popping', 'special', 'effects', 'world', 'quickly', 'changes', 'around', 'Hartdegen', 'transfixed', 'fascination.Though', 'people', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'film', '800,000', 'year', 'jump', 'future', 'made', 'quite', 'few', 'standout', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'Pearce', 'first', 'sight', 'Eloi', 'village', 'later', 'conversation', 'Irons', 'character', 'film', 'also', 'energetic', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'tense', 'well-directed', 'especially', 'morlock', 'hunt', 'sequence', 'would', 'probably', 'frighten', 'younger', 'children', 'particularly', 'exhilarating', 'scene', 'where', 'Hartdegen', 'fight', 'huge', 'morlock', 'single-handedly', 'speedily', 'chased', 'creature', 'forest', 'up', 'wooden', 'tower.As', 'far', 'performances', 'go', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'quite', 'good', 'Hartdegen', 'delivering', 'yet', 'again', 'memorable', 'turn', 'Pearce', 'character', 'convincing', 'nerdy', 'scientist', 'physically-capable', 'action', 'hero', 'small', 'feat', 'there', 'Samantha', 'Mumba', 'little', 'impression', 'Pearce', 'sort-of', 'love', 'interest', 'coming', 'little', 'flat', 'Admittedly', 'good', 'figure', 'kind', 'took', 'attention', 'acting', 'few', 'moments', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'standout', 'uber-morlock', 'completely', 'creepy', 'somehow', 'over-the-top', 'restrained', 'same', 'time.It', 'unfortunate', 'Time', 'Machine', ""n't"", 'all', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'days', 'apply', 'most', 'big-budget', 'studio', 'films', 'nice', 'see', 'inspired', 'spirited', 'sci-fi', 'adventure', 'entertaining', 'like', 'good', 'science', 'fiction', ""'re"", 'willing', 'accept', 'film', 'flaws', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'film', 'too', '***', '1/2', '*****']",N/A

588291,A2VE83MZF98ITY,B00005JKLZ,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[3, 5]","I must confess that I march to a different drummer when it comes to this film.  I enjoyed it for the most part, and find it very clever in many aspects.  The major drawback comes from the plot - it is far too simplistic for the elaborate care that went into both the visual aspect of the film as well as the nice touches at almost every turn.The plot is rather simple - Alexander Hartdegen, a mechanical physics professor in turn-of-the-century New York (turn of the nineteenth-into-the-twentieth century, that is), has his head in his equations, apart from one thing, his love for Emma.  When she is killed in a botched mugging (yes, New York at that time even had muggings in Central Park), Hartdegen drops everything to invent the time machine he'd theorised, in order to prevent Emma's death.  He soon makes the discovery that it isn't possible to undo the past (at least not that aspect of the past), but becomes obsessed with finding the reason why.  He speculates this is more likely to be answered in the future than in the past or present, and thus goes forward in time.  He makes a few stops along the way before arriving at a far-distant future (nearly a million years in the future), in which the human race has evolved into two distinct species - one on the surface, and one below the earth.So far, so good - departure from H.G. Wells' original classic (a great piece of literature) and from the earlier film, but not beyond the pale.  The effects here are truly stunning in many respects - the time machine itself is a marvel (the DVD has a feature on the making of the machine), and the time transformation scenes are very inspiring, up to and including the zoom-away shot from the machine into the air all the way to the city on the moon.  The Eloi city along the river is also a remarkable scene.  The movie rightly won awards, including the Academy Award, for these effects.  Unfortunately, effects do not a movie make.  This is where the plot failure comes into play.Hartdegen seems to give up far too early in trying to change the past, and his relationships (such as we get to see them) in the future are very stilted.  Jeremy Irons (himself an Academy Award winner) has precious little screen time, to deliver what is perhaps the most anticlimactic resolutions I've seen in a long time.  The overarching question should be 'why?', but seems to transformed into 'what if?' in an unclear way (the deleted introductory scene, available on the DVD, helps to more firmly establish the question, but, alas, it was deleted).  Hartdegen remains in the future (like Wells' and the earlier film's scientists, albeit in a different way), perhaps to help transform the future, but we'll never know (a sequel is not likely).Despite the thin plot, what I found most enjoyable (apart from the special effects) were the clever touches here and there, far too numerous to mention.  When Hartdegen arrives in 2030 (prompted by an advertisement proclaiming 'the future is now'), he encounters a user-friendly library computer (personified by Orlando Bloom) with a real sense of humour and humanity.  When Hartdegen asks about time travel, the library computer even incorporates Star Trek gestures and sound effects into its discussion (as well as the yet-unwritten musical version of 'The Time Machine', by Andrew Lloyd Weber).  One woman in the distant future speaks English (now called the stone language, for the stone engravings that remain from store fronts and the like), but speaks without accent (strange enough, but even stranger that New Yorker Hartdegen sounds more British, as does the Morlock leader Jeremy Irons).Indeed, there are so many little pieces here is seems that the writers spent more time trying to incorporate bits of cleverness throughout the script than making sure the script as a whole had thorough soundness.Another piece I really liked was the music.  The sombre brass tones, the triumphant orchestral arrangements, the folk/modern synthesis for the Eloi, and the dramatic scoring really enhanced this film beyond measure.  The DVD has bits of the score that replay on a loop sequence during menu screens, and I've sometimes left these on to hear the pieces over and over again.The DVD has one of the better menu sequence set-ups I've seen, simulating the machine effects in visuals and sound, as well as incorporating score elements and special effects.  DVD extras include the delete scene, commentaries by many of the crew, several pieces on the special effects (including one on the time machine itself),This is a fairly good film, despite its flaws.  Overall I would award it three-and-a-half stars, but will round up to four in honour of the effects, the music, and clever pieces.",4,No time like the present...,1135468800,"12 25, 2005",2005,4721,"['must', 'confess', 'march', 'different', 'drummer', 'when', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'part', 'find', 'very', 'clever', 'many', 'aspects', 'major', 'drawback', 'plot', 'far', 'too', 'simplistic', 'elaborate', 'care', 'went', 'visual', 'aspect', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'nice', 'touches', 'almost', 'turn.The', 'plot', 'rather', 'simple', 'Alexander', 'Hartdegen', 'mechanical', 'physics', 'professor', 'turn-of-the-century', 'New', 'York', 'turn', 'nineteenth-into-the-twentieth', 'century', 'head', 'equations', 'apart', 'one', 'thing', 'love', 'Emma', 'When', 'killed', 'botched', 'mugging', 'yes', 'New', 'York', 'time', 'even', 'had', 'muggings', 'Central', 'Park', 'Hartdegen', 'everything', 'invent', 'time', 'machine', ""'d"", 'theorised', 'order', 'prevent', 'Emma', 'death', 'soon', 'discovery', ""n't"", 'possible', 'undo', 'past', 'least', 'not', 'aspect', 'past', 'becomes', 'obsessed', 'finding', 'reason', 'why', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'answered', 'future', 'past', 'present', 'thus', 'forward', 'time', 'few', 'stops', 'way', 'arriving', 'far-distant', 'future', 'nearly', 'million', 'years', 'future', 'human', 'race', 'evolved', 'two', 'distinct', 'species', 'one', 'surface', 'one', 'earth.So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'departure', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'original', 'classic', 'great', 'piece', 'literature', 'earlier', 'film', 'not', 'pale', 'effects', 'here', 'are', 'truly', 'stunning', 'many', 'respects', 'time', 'machine', 'marvel', 'DVD', 'feature', 'making', 'machine', 'time', 'transformation', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'inspiring', 'up', 'including', 'zoom-away', 'shot', 'machine', 'air', 'way', 'city', 'moon', 'Eloi', 'city', 'river', 'also', 'remarkable', 'scene', 'movie', 'rightly', 'won', 'awards', 'including', 'Academy', 'Award', 'effects', 'Unfortunately', 'effects', 'do', 'not', 'movie', 'make', 'where', 'plot', 'failure', 'play.Hartdegen', 'give', 'up', 'far', 'too', 'early', 'trying', 'change', 'past', 'relationships', 'such', 'get', 'see', 'future', 'are', 'very', 'stilted', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'precious', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'deliver', 'what', 'perhaps', 'most', 'anticlimactic', 'resolutions', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'overarching', 'question', 'should', 'be', ""'why"", 'transformed', 'unclear', 'way', 'deleted', 'introductory', 'scene', 'available', 'DVD', 'more', 'firmly', 'establish', 'question', 'alas', 'was', 'deleted', 'Hartdegen', 'future', 'Wells', 'earlier', 'film', 'scientists', 'albeit', 'different', 'way', 'perhaps', 'help', 'transform', 'future', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'sequel', 'not', 'likely', '.Despite', 'thin', 'plot', 'what', 'found', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'apart', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'clever', 'touches', 'here', 'there', 'far', 'too', 'numerous', 'mention', 'When', 'Hartdegen', '2030', 'prompted', 'advertisement', 'proclaiming', ""'the"", 'future', 'now', 'user-friendly', 'library', 'computer', 'personified', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'real', 'sense', 'humour', 'humanity', 'When', 'Hartdegen', 'time', 'travel', 'library', 'computer', 'even', 'Star', 'Trek', 'gestures', 'sound', 'effects', 'discussion', 'as', 'well', 'yet-unwritten', 'musical', 'version', ""'The"", 'Time', 'Machine', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Weber', 'One', 'woman', 'distant', 'future', 'English', 'now', 'called', 'stone', 'language', 'stone', 'remain', 'store', 'fronts', 'like', 'accent', 'strange', 'enough', 'even', 'stranger', 'New', 'Yorker', 'Hartdegen', 'more', 'British', 'Morlock', 'leader', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', '.Indeed', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'little', 'pieces', 'here', 'writers', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'trying', 'incorporate', 'bits', 'cleverness', 'script', 'making', 'sure', 'script', 'whole', 'had', 'soundness.Another', 'piece', 'really', 'liked', 'was', 'music', 'sombre', 'brass', 'tones', 'triumphant', 'orchestral', 'arrangements', 'folk/modern', 'synthesis', 'Eloi', 'dramatic', 'scoring', 'really', 'enhanced', 'film', 'measure', 'DVD', 'bits', 'score', 'replay', 'loop', 'sequence', 'menu', 'screens', ""'ve"", 'sometimes', 'left', 'hear', 'pieces', 'again.The', 'DVD', 'one', 'better', 'menu', 'sequence', 'set-ups', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'simulating', 'machine', 'effects', 'visuals', 'sound', 'as', 'well', 'incorporating', 'score', 'elements', 'special', 'effects', 'DVD', 'include', 'delete', 'scene', 'commentaries', 'many', 'crew', 'several', 'pieces', 'special', 'effects', 'including', 'one', 'time', 'machine', 'fairly', 'good', 'film', 'flaws', 'Overall', 'would', 'award', 'three-and-a-half', 'stars', 'will', 'round', 'up', 'four', 'honour', 'effects', 'music', 'clever', 'pieces']",N/A
588292,A13SLHD50Y8ORI,B00005JKLZ,"Geoffrey Colman ""geoffc86""","[0, 1]","Many people have (somewhat wrongfully, in my opinion) lambasted this movie by dwelling on the perceived overuse of special effects and the subtle changes to the plot of the original book. Quite frankly, while these charges are at least somewhat true, these people fail to enjoy this movie for what it is--a modern reinterpretation, rather than an outright remake.Case-in-point, many people reading this might not realize that H.G. Wells was going for strict social commentary when drawing up the Morlock and Eloi. The biological distinction was intended to mirror the class distinction that was beginning to spread as the western world industrialized towards the end of the 19th century. Naturally, this notion is virtually meaningless in a post-industrial service economy such as the United States or England, where the vast majority of the people have better standards of living than they did when H.G. Wells wrote this book. Thus, it only seems natural that the movie-makers would alter a few major plot elements in order to more accurately explain this situation from a modern point-of-view (i.e., the destruction of the moon). Incidentally, I think this was actually quite well done: the writers show how our hubris ends up being our downfall. But none of this is particularly new. The previous film version chalked it up to nuclear war, a far more plausible notion at the time it was made. Therefore, while they may have tweaked a few plot elements, they serve the movie quite well, and add a nice coherent feel to the overall presentation.I am honestly a little offended that this movie was not nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score. Klaus Badelt is a timeless genius, on par with (and possibly greater than) Hans Zimmer. The dramatic overtures during the time travel sequences and the moving world music motifs during the scenes with the Eloi (highly reminiscent of certain Polynesian and African pieces) were enough to bring me to my knees. On the whole, I think the music was incredibly appropriate for this movie; much more so than a lot of the random mainstream songs haphazardly cobbled together for certain genres of movies.In general, I greatly enjoyed this movie as a piece of fun escapism. For the record, I enjoyed the original H.G. Wells novel, and I think the producers did a reasonably good job modernizing it. I would recommend this movie to fans of classic science fiction only if they are not strict traditionalists when it comes to scripts and willing to keep an open mind.",5,Future perfect,1140393600,"02 20, 2006",2006,2515,"['Many', 'people', 'have', 'somewhat', 'wrongfully', 'opinion', 'lambasted', 'movie', 'dwelling', 'perceived', 'overuse', 'special', 'effects', 'subtle', 'changes', 'plot', 'original', 'book', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'charges', 'are', 'least', 'somewhat', 'true', 'people', 'fail', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'what', 'modern', 'reinterpretation', 'rather', 'outright', 'remake.Case-in-point', 'many', 'people', 'reading', 'might', 'not', 'realize', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'was', 'going', 'strict', 'social', 'commentary', 'when', 'drawing', 'up', 'Morlock', 'Eloi', 'biological', 'distinction', 'was', 'intended', 'mirror', 'class', 'distinction', 'was', 'beginning', 'spread', 'western', 'world', 'industrialized', 'end', '19th', 'century', 'Naturally', 'notion', 'virtually', 'meaningless', 'post-industrial', 'service', 'economy', 'such', 'United', 'States', 'England', 'where', 'vast', 'majority', 'people', 'have', 'better', 'standards', 'living', 'did', 'when', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'wrote', 'book', 'Thus', 'only', 'natural', 'movie-makers', 'would', 'alter', 'few', 'major', 'plot', 'elements', 'order', 'more', 'accurately', 'explain', 'situation', 'modern', 'point-of-view', 'i.e.', 'destruction', 'moon', 'Incidentally', 'think', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'writers', 'show', 'how', 'hubris', 'up', 'being', 'downfall', 'none', 'particularly', 'new', 'previous', 'film', 'version', 'chalked', 'up', 'nuclear', 'war', 'far', 'more', 'plausible', 'notion', 'time', 'was', 'made', 'Therefore', 'may', 'have', 'tweaked', 'few', 'plot', 'elements', 'serve', 'movie', 'quite', 'well', 'add', 'nice', 'coherent', 'feel', 'overall', 'presentation.I', 'am', 'honestly', 'little', 'offended', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Original', 'Score', 'Klaus', 'Badelt', 'timeless', 'genius', 'par', 'possibly', 'greater', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'dramatic', 'overtures', 'time', 'travel', 'sequences', 'moving', 'world', 'music', 'motifs', 'scenes', 'Eloi', 'highly', 'reminiscent', 'certain', 'Polynesian', 'African', 'pieces', 'were', 'enough', 'bring', 'knees', 'whole', 'think', 'music', 'was', 'incredibly', 'appropriate', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'lot', 'random', 'mainstream', 'songs', 'haphazardly', 'cobbled', 'together', 'certain', 'genres', 'movies.In', 'general', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'piece', 'fun', 'escapism', 'record', 'enjoyed', 'original', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'novel', 'think', 'producers', 'did', 'reasonably', 'good', 'job', 'modernizing', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'fans', 'classic', 'science', 'fiction', 'only', 'are', 'not', 'strict', 'traditionalists', 'when', 'scripts', 'willing', 'keep', 'open', 'mind']",N/A

588304,A27W5AJNP6YX7Z,B00005JKLZ,"Ivy Bewley ""Hiedra""","[2, 4]","This is one of those very rare cases where I actually like the remake more than the original. I must say, however, that the original from 1960 (Time Machine) was excellent. I love the theory of time travel - the concept fascinates me - and I don't often find a movie about time travel that I do not enjoy. May I also recommendThe Butterfly Effect,Time Quest,Dead Again,The Jacket, andSomewhere in Time (Collector's Edition)? Honorable mention toThe Lake House.Anyway, I really love this movie. I am surprised that Guy Pearce has not become more famous after his starring role in this one. I've seen him now and then but not much. To begin with, the song that's played during the menu (and various times throughout the film) is just beautiful. The movie gets off to a different start than the original. I don't know that Professor Hartdegen (Pearce) really needed a motive for inventing time travel (as curiosity was enough for the first movie), but it worked in this case.I thought it was very ambitious of the movie to travel only 30 years into the future (as of the date of the movie, not the professor's time). Pretty much all of us who enjoyed the movie will still be around then to see how accurate or how far off base they were! (It's only 18 years away now!) Although, I have to say it was nice to see a cleaner, friendlier New York where everyone was walking or riding bikes. And then a measly 7 years later when we dumb humans blew up the moon. Sigh. Will we never learn? Hopefully.Normally, I scorn the fact that movies these days overdo the special effects at the expense of plot and acting. Especially when it is a remake. (Planet of the Apes: The Legacy Collection (Planet of the Apes / Beneath the / Escape from the / Conquest of the / Battle for the), for example, is one of my favorite films of all time. The remake was OK, but really kind of pointless.) The Time Machine, sadly, does overdo some of the special effects. The actual machine, for example, was so simple and beautiful in the original. Here it was often hidden behind a big blue space bubble, for lack of a better description. And the Morlocks... They definitely looked more realistic, but I think they could have done it with make-up instead of going overboard and ""needing"" 3 puppeteers to animate each face! Then, the actors playing the Morlocks could have even used their own eyeballs instead of looking out of a limited-view camera in the fake face's nose! But I felt that the acting still had merit and the movie on a whole was still amazing, so I could overlook the fact that they got a little carried away with the new technology available to them (10 years ago yet, since I'm writing this in 2012). However, I did love watching the landscape change over the millenniums. That was some fascinating artwork.There were flaws, of course. The language in particular bothered me. Would the language change for a race of people who stayed in one area? I don't know. But I do know that if they learned English but didn't use it, they couldn't just start speaking it out of nowhere. (I feel qualified to say this because I have studied 4 languages and it is not easy.) And just what did ""quinn"" mean? They used that an awful lot. And I am confused about the moon. Wouldn't a streaky moon instead of a round moon change the orbit of the Earth or something? But the biggest problem I had was the ""answer"" Prof. Hartdegen finally got in the end, from the Morlock with the over-sized brain. Oh, so smart! The thing is, he DID change the past, even if it was not in the way he wanted. The guy who drove the carriage that hit his girl now had to live with guilt. And the thug in the park may have hurt someone else. So much you could analyze, and the Uber-Morlock's answer was way too simplistic. After all, he DID travel through time, so it WAS possible!The reason I like this better than the original (just a bit) is simply because I found the continuous narration in the original a bit tiring, and a bit distracting. And frankly, I liked the Eloi better in this version. They were not as dumbed-down. And while they accepted what was happening to them and didn't fight back, at least they cared about each other.So here is my personal opinion about time travel: it is not possible. I think if it were ever going to be possible, it would have always been possible, or at least we would have always known about it, because we would have been visited by people from the future. And that is something that even the government couldn't have kept secret. But it's just as well, because it wouldn't be a good idea anyway. That's especially apparent in movies like The Butterfly Effect.

First it contains a romantic beginning and a voyage in the past to correct the death of the girlfriend of the hero. Unluckily you cannot change the past, you can only change the circumstances of events. But the main bulk of the film is of course going to the distant future, to see what the earth and humanity will be. It projects the tale in the book into thefinal episode of the book : the disappearance of the hero with his time machine. The film also changes the philosophical meaning of the book. In the book, humanity in the future is divided in two species, one living underground and working, the descendents of the working class, and one living on the surface on the luxuriant nature without having to work, the descendents of the bourgeoisie. In other words H.G. Wells invests darwinism into the schematic vision of the first industrial revolution and its class struggle. Unluckily in the future the working species hunts the non-working species who are their meat. In the film the same evolution is caused by a natural catastrophe : the disintegration of the moon and its falling onto the earth. We can note that the surface species has regressed to a primitive state and the underground species has become some kind of devilish industrial species that works to produce nothing, the slaves of their own underground pointless industry, some modern representation of the devil or hell. One point is common : this world has lost all connection with god, all religious dimension, and this future world is the result of some darwinistic evolution. It is the future of humanity after the death of God, though less clearly in the film than in the book. The rest you have to see by yourself. The special effects are quite good and they really look natural. The suspense of the film is also very strong. But I will regret two things : some of the technical points are a lot fuzzier than in the book, hence we have to accept a lot more unrealistic questionable points and I do not think H.G. Wells envisaged the idea of teaching the surface species how to fight : they were absolutely non-working and for them fighting was not even a concept they could imagine, invent or learn. In fact, and here the film is short, to fight you need to believe in some higher and stronger force that gives you the objective and energy to fight. This is often some religious representation of the group that justifies, hence sustains fighting against other groups. But this shortcoming reveals a shortcoming in the book : any living species will have a survival instinct and hence fighting will be natural, not something you learn like in the film, not something you ignore like in the book, something you know because of your hormones.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,H.G.

The original wasn't actually the book but it's much more accurate than this Simon Wells remake. It added too much and even changed the names of the main characters. Instead the Time Machine being made in the sake of science, Alexandra (Guy Pearce) creates the Time Machine to try and stop his girlfriend from being killed. Instead of the Eloys being pretty small like in the book or being a bunch of blondes like in the original movie they are all natives with their own language. They know they're in danger and pretty much know they're cattle to the Morlocks in this version as well. Plus there's a leader to the Morlocks played by Jeromy Irons in this version and he looks more like Mr. Freeze.For being related to H.G. Wells who wrote the book, Simon Wells the director butchered up the story a lot. Still I must say I enjoyed the movie, it's still a fun popcorn movie. The visuals are good, as are the action and the performance by Guy Pearce...The oscar winning special effects are a bit dated and the Morlocks are obviously just people jumping around in make-up and suits.

It's as if all the plots in the world had been used and this film was all that was left. Good gracious people, couldn't Guy Pearce have at least gone and visited some REAL LIFE, fully functioning historical people? I think it would have been more interesting for him to go back and see the writing of the Mayflower Compact as opposed to this utter nonsense.In this film, we get to witness Guy Pearce, usually a very credible actor(Memento, Count of Monte Cristo, LA Confidential), pull off one of his worse acting jobs since his first high school play - which might have been better than this junk.(Right now, defenders of this film are saying, 'BUT it's such an amazing tale of adventue!').  Pardon me if I STRONGLY disagree. This film is the epitome of the modern day B-rated film. The main character(played by Pearce) loses his wife in a botched robbery attempt. He makes a time machine to go back and save her. It doesn't work. Instead, he eventually ends up in the distant future in a time where giant ape-looking men steal half naked Indian people and carry them off to their underground lair. Sound familiar? Yep, try a film compelation of Planet of the Apes, Water World, Escape from New York, The Sound of Music and, cha ching,  you've got The Time Machine.  Now, you might be saying, ""Why would he throw in the Sound of Music, I liked that film!"" Well, I did too, but to add it to the other three was just a simple point of emphasis as to how scattered and twisted this film really is.I watched films for the sake of seeing if they're going to show me something new.  The Time Machine showed me nothing, except for the fact that it made my mind so tired and bewildered that it took me a half-hour just to cool back down.Special DVD features?

You never really comes into the world of the film before it ends.I could say that the first 40 minutes of the movie is as good as possible, but in the latter half, it all passes too quickly!The movie is about a technician named Alex Hartdegen, whose beloved is killed in an accident, and then he spends years building a time machine to change the past. But (of course, it`s a science movie),something goes wrong and he is thrown 800,000 yers into the future where mankind is divided in two races, which are simply : the hunters and the hunted.The special effects are very fine, but the story is smoothing out towards the climatic ending of the film. The acting is also rather good (may be except for the pop star Samantha Mumba, who makes her acting debut here)but the movie should have been longer.Worth to notice is also the excellent music by Klaus Badelt - I can listen to the soundtrack a million times over and never get tired!Well, this film is not bad.

588313,A193A7T1E8CUTB,B00005JKLZ,John F. Frederick,"[2, 2]","H.G. Wells was, let's say, a mediocre socialist, journalist and historian who brilliantly and imaginatively wrote social commentary and criticism in the form of science fiction.  He wrote a good number of other things too, but he is best known for his science fiction, and for good reason; among his writings, his science fiction is undisputedly the best, and, among science fiction authors, he is undisputedly one of the greatest of all time.  In the 1960 George Pal movie version of Wells' classic, The Time Machine, one of the characters is made to pose the question at the end: If you were reduced to having access to only three books, which three would you choose?  If I were forced to choose between the Communist Manifesto and The Time Machine as one of my selections, I would definitely choose The Time Machine.That being said, however, the first thing to say about the 2002 Dreamworks film, ""The Time Machine,"" is that it has absolutely nothing to do with Wells' novel.  Some of the characters names are the same, some of the dates are the same, the title is the same--there is a time machine in both--and that is pretty much the end of the resemblance.That being said, is it fair to compare this movie to the book, or to the 1960 version, which was loosely based upon it?  Well, yes, to this extent: Is it fair to say that the author of the 2002 screenplay deserves the title--based on this new yarn--as one of the greatest science fiction writers of all time?  Answer: no.That being said, is the movie any good?  Yes.The story is simply about technology ""going too far.""  A scientist, who at first thinks ""there is no such thing"" as going too far with technology, eventually changes his mind-too late for his first romance (in 1899), but in time for his second (800,000 years later).  At first he has a great passion for science, but this soon gets subordinated to his intention to change the past for personal (albeit humanly understandable) reasons.  He makes a time machine.  It works, but it doesn't work; he can go back in time, but he can't change the past.  Dazed, and forgetting his training in elementary logic, he can't understand why, and takes a needless trip into the future instead of re-reading his logic books.  Along the way he finds more evidence that technology never really does what it is supposed to, and gradually decides to join the native castaways of the future, using (and sacrificing) his machine to try to at least undo the damage that technology over the millennia has done, at least in terms of its effects on the future (he can't use the machine for the purpose it was constructed, but that is true for all machines, so that is no criticism of it).  And so: he was ""a man ahead of his time"" (maybe so, for 1899-at least for a professor of applied mechanics).A thin story line, but fun, with due references made to both Wells' novel and the 1960 film (given its title), complete with satisfying cameo appearances for those thinking that the movie might have something to do with the novel by Wells.On a more serious side, it seems to have some kind of backhanded recognition that human beings are more than machines.  There is also a fairly serious subtext dealing with irreplaceable loss and taking responsibility for the future.  But here the movie is unable to take itself seriously, and the insight is not developed.  In a way, it is even contradicted.  In this sense, the movie cannot be taken seriously.  It is fluff.  Its critique of technology is even 1950ish.  At best, a sci-fi companion to ""The Emerald Forest.""  At worst, it's a Gidget vs. the giant crab monsters, or even, a Godzilla on Gilligan's Island.  Great grandson Simon Wells did a reasonable job directing it; too bad he didn't have the opportunity to direct a serious attempt to put the classic novel to film.The high point was good special effects and music, no doubt.  The hokey portrayal of 2030 AD, however, insults the audience (though the masses in NYC riding bicycles China style was a fun touch, and the brief flirtation with a woman unlocking her bike, commenting on the time machine, was an effective moment).  What will people make of this watching it in 2030 plus?  It seems to me that the comic relief of the computer AI hologram from said year is a rip off of Robbie the Robot from Forbidden Planet and/or Data from Star Trek (perhaps a cross between the two).  On the other hand, the movie is also complete with cryptic islandific BN for the many moments when the audience is likely too bored to pay attention to the story.  But there are better places to look for that.BYOP (bring your own popcorn)All that being said, I wish to say that Dreamworks has a pretty good batting average for producing decent entertainment.5+

He seems able to change details of the past but not the main results so he turns toward the future.  He sees the progress of humanity as it builds and moves forward.  A catastrophic event involving the moon changes the world drastically.  Finally, 800,000 years into the future he stops.  There he meets a peaceful and idyllic people.  They are both primitive and advanced at the same time.  This seems like a beautiful new world.  But then the Morlocks rear their heads and the truth of the world is revealed.Morlocks live underground and come up from time to time to prey on the innocents above.  While they do not like things this way they have no way to fight back.  The time traveler feels he needs to help these people and rescue those who have been taken.  Eventually he is successful to a point and works to make a new life for himself among these people of the future.This film often seems less like a new adaptation of the novel and more like an adaptation of George Pal's film.  There are three main differences.  The nuclear catastrophe has been replaced by the Lunar mishap (no Cold War anymore).  The Eloi are less child-like.  The Morlocks are more like Verne's Selenites from FIRST MEN IN THE MOON.  Replacing the original Cold War fears was a good idea but its replacement was silly.  I approve of the new Eloi and Morlocks although they are further from Wells's original.  In the end the film has some parts that are better and some that are worse.  Having now seen the film I am not surprised at its poor performance.  It lacks the action and intensity that successful films of this genre usually have.  But it is not a bad film, just one that won't particularly appeal to the main body of movie goers.",3,"Some Good Changes, Some Not",1173744000,"03 13, 2007",2007,1999,"['H.G', 'Wells', 'classic', 'tale', 'adventure', 'social', 'commentary', 'new', 'face', 'latest', 'film', 'version', 'scientist', 'obsessed', 'work', 'always', 'late', 'manages', 'build', 'machine', 'capable', 'moving', 'time', 'first', 'attempts', 'improve', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'planned', 'able', 'change', 'details', 'past', 'not', 'main', 'results', 'future', 'progress', 'humanity', 'forward', 'catastrophic', 'event', 'involving', 'moon', 'world', 'drastically', 'Finally', '800,000', 'years', 'future', 'peaceful', 'idyllic', 'people', 'are', 'primitive', 'advanced', 'same', 'time', 'beautiful', 'new', 'world', 'then', 'Morlocks', 'rear', 'heads', 'truth', 'world', 'revealed.Morlocks', 'live', 'underground', 'come', 'up', 'time', 'time', 'prey', 'innocents', 'do', 'not', 'things', 'way', 'have', 'way', 'fight', 'back', 'time', 'traveler', 'feels', 'help', 'people', 'rescue', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'Eventually', 'successful', 'point', 'make', 'new', 'life', 'people', 'future.This', 'film', 'often', 'less', 'new', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'more', 'adaptation', 'George', 'Pal', 'film', 'are', 'three', 'main', 'differences', 'nuclear', 'catastrophe', 'been', 'replaced', 'Lunar', 'mishap', 'Cold', 'War', 'anymore', 'Eloi', 'are', 'less', 'child-like', 'Morlocks', 'are', 'more', 'Verne', 'Selenites', 'FIRST', 'MEN', 'IN', 'THE', 'MOON', 'Replacing', 'original', 'Cold', 'War', 'fears', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'replacement', 'was', 'silly', 'approve', 'new', 'Eloi', 'Morlocks', 'are', 'further', 'Wells', 'original', 'end', 'film', 'parts', 'are', 'better', 'are', 'worse', 'Having', 'now', 'seen', 'film', 'am', 'not', 'surprised', 'poor', 'performance', 'action', 'intensity', 'successful', 'films', 'genre', 'usually', 'have', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'just', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'appeal', 'main', 'body', 'movie', 'goers']",N/A

From the ""Back to the Future"" saga to ""Doctor Who"" to Michael Crichton's novel, ""Timeline,"" they've run the gamut on quality, story, and overall enjoyability.  None of them, however, can match the brilliance of the original ""Time Machine"" book written by H.G. Wells.  The original film based on that book does quite well also.With that in mind, I didn't expect much from this remake starring Guy Pearce.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Though it lacks the appeal of the old Rod Taylor version of the time traveller, there is something captivating about this film.  It has the whiz-bang special effects that have become commonplace these days.  The story moves at a hearty pace that doesn't give you much time to breath.  Orlando Jones is splendid as a holographic librarian who accesses information for Pearce.  Samantha Mumba does a good job as well.  Pearce is good, especially considering that this film lacks the substance that the original book contained.  The only person who didn't fit in this film was Jeremy Irons.  He is a fine actor, and his performance is nice, but his character just doesn't work in this movie.  It slows down the pace a little as well.The Morlocks are hideous looking creatures, and are quite something to see.  The way that they come out of and return to the ground looks a little shaky, but if suffices.I recommend this one to sci-fi buffs who like a little more thought put into their movies.

Confidential&quot;) in the role of scientist and inventor, Alexander Hartdegen, who is determined to prove that time travel is possible.  His determination is turned to desperation by a personal tragedy that now drives him to want to change the past.  Testing his theories with a time machine of his own invention, Hartdegen is hurtled 800,000 years into the future, where he discovers that mankind has divided into the hunter...and the huntedThe film is a little confusing. I think it answers most of thequestions we want to know, but it does this very quickly, too quickly in my opinion. If you're not listening intently at all times, you might miss some significant material as I did. I am not quite sure how the Morlocks came to be, although I think I was told. I'm not completely sure what happened to the moon in 2037, although I think I was told.

Bernabo,"[3, 4]","I was not an especially big fan of the George Pal film version of ""The Time Machine,"" but then I was never that much of a fan of the original H. G. Wells novel.  However, in this 2002 film version of the story I find that the same things I liked in the 1960 film are what I liked this time around as well, and that would be when our young scientist, Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce), gets in his time machine and we see the years pass while he looks on in wonder.  Of course, the 2002 version has the advantage of state of the art CGI effects so this time not only do we get to see flowers, automobiles, and manikins herald the passage of the years, we get to see massive geological changes in the same fashion.  But once we get 800,000 years into the future and our hero discovers the split in human evolution between the Eloi and the Morlocks.  At that point the Wells story is dressed up social commentary on the British class system and the action is fairly melodramatic.  That was the case with the George Pal version and director Simon Wells (great-grandson of H.G. Wells) follows suit.  Of course, now we have anomorphic faces for the Morlocks and the Eloi are more environmentally conscious, but the last act is still little more than a variation on the pulp magazine commonplace of man rescues woman from monsters.The script by John Logan, which references both David Duncan's script along with the Wells novel, adds a personal level to the hero's quest this time around, as Hartdegen begins more interested in going back to the past to right a great wrong rather than head off into the future.  I also liked the reason for the decline of earth's civilization, which we get a quick look at in Hartdegen's brief visit to the year 2037; in fact, if the movie had stopped at that point it probably would have been more interesting.  It also would have had the virtue of not being too predictable, but then how many of the people who watched this movie ever read the novel or saw the original movie?  It is the concept of the time machine that is a staple of science fiction, not the story that spawned the genre.This version of ""The Time Machine"" is certainly pretty and the special effects certainly overwhelm the performances; the time machine itself is truly awe-inspiring.  But you have to wonder about any film where the best performance is turned in by Orlando Jones as Vox, the holographic compendium of all human knowledge.  This is actually not a knock; Jones shows what he can do in his second scene and I have to like any riff on science fiction and time travel that includes mentioning Harlan Ellison while throwing in a mock Andrew Lloyd Webber song.  Pearce is supposed to be playing an non-traditional hero-type, which is certainly true, but that just ends up ringing hollow when he is confronted with the violent Morlocks and manages to come out ahead.  Still, there is one timeless happy moment in the film when Alan Young makes the requisite cameo appearance by a member of the 1960 film.  I was not offended by this film, because the George Pal film does not hold a special place in my heart or mind, but neither was I inspired by this film; there has to be more to movies like this than the special effects.  Ironically, if there is anything in this world where people get to go back and fix mistakes it is major motion pictures and if you listen to the commentary track with the director and film editor it is amazing how even months later after the finished project they are still coming up with ideas that would have made it a better flick.",4,Dazzling special effects for time travel but that's about it,1043971200,"01 31, 2003",2003,3569,"['was', 'not', 'especially', 'big', 'fan', 'George', 'Pal', 'film', 'version', 'Time', 'Machine', 'then', 'was', 'never', 'that', 'much', 'fan', 'original', 'H.', 'G.', 'Wells', 'novel', 'However', '2002', 'film', 'version', 'story', 'find', 'same', 'things', 'liked', '1960', 'film', 'are', 'what', 'liked', 'time', 'around', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'be', 'when', 'young', 'scientist', 'Alexander', 'Hartdegen', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'time', 'machine', 'see', 'years', 'pass', 'wonder', 'course', '2002', 'version', 'advantage', 'state', 'art', 'CGI', 'effects', 'so', 'time', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'flowers', 'automobiles', 'herald', 'passage', 'years', 'get', 'see', 'massive', 'geological', 'changes', 'same', 'fashion', 'once', 'get', '800,000', 'years', 'future', 'hero', 'split', 'human', 'evolution', 'Eloi', 'Morlocks', 'point', 'Wells', 'story', 'dressed', 'up', 'social', 'commentary', 'British', 'class', 'system', 'action', 'fairly', 'melodramatic', 'was', 'case', 'George', 'Pal', 'version', 'director', 'Simon', 'Wells', 'great-grandson', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'suit', 'course', 'now', 'have', 'anomorphic', 'Morlocks', 'Eloi', 'are', 'more', 'environmentally', 'conscious', 'last', 'act', 'still', 'little', 'more', 'variation', 'pulp', 'magazine', 'commonplace', 'man', 'rescues', 'woman', 'monsters.The', 'script', 'John', 'Logan', 'David', 'Duncan', 'script', 'Wells', 'novel', 'personal', 'level', 'hero', 'quest', 'time', 'around', 'Hartdegen', 'more', 'interested', 'going', 'back', 'past', 'right', 'great', 'wrong', 'rather', 'head', 'off', 'future', 'also', 'liked', 'reason', 'decline', 'earth', 'civilization', 'get', 'quick', 'look', 'Hartdegen', 'brief', 'visit', 'year', '2037', 'fact', 'movie', 'had', 'stopped', 'point', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'virtue', 'not', 'being', 'too', 'predictable', 'then', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'watched', 'movie', 'ever', 'read', 'novel', 'saw', 'original', 'movie', 'concept', 'time', 'machine', 'staple', 'science', 'fiction', 'not', 'story', 'spawned', 'genre.This', 'version', 'Time', 'Machine', 'certainly', 'pretty', 'special', 'effects', 'certainly', 'overwhelm', 'performances', 'time', 'machine', 'truly', 'awe-inspiring', 'have', 'wonder', 'film', 'where', 'best', 'performance', 'turned', 'Orlando', 'Jones', 'Vox', 'holographic', 'compendium', 'human', 'knowledge', 'actually', 'not', 'knock', 'Jones', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'second', 'scene', 'have', 'like', 'riff', 'science', 'fiction', 'time', 'travel', 'mentioning', 'Harlan', 'Ellison', 'throwing', 'mock', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'song', 'Pearce', 'supposed', 'be', 'playing', 'non-traditional', 'hero-type', 'certainly', 'true', 'just', 'up', 'ringing', 'hollow', 'when', 'confronted', 'violent', 'Morlocks', 'come', 'out', 'ahead', 'Still', 'one', 'timeless', 'happy', 'moment', 'film', 'when', 'Alan', 'Young', 'requisite', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'member', '1960', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'offended', 'film', 'George', 'Pal', 'film', 'not', 'hold', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'mind', 'was', 'inspired', 'film', 'there', 'be', 'more', 'movies', 'special', 'effects', 'Ironically', 'anything', 'world', 'where', 'people', 'get', 'go', 'back', 'fix', 'mistakes', 'major', 'motion', 'pictures', 'listen', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'film', 'editor', 'amazing', 'how', 'even', 'months', 'later', 'finished', 'project', 'are', 'still', 'coming', 'up', 'ideas', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'flick']",N/A

588331,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00005JKLZ,Lawyeraau,"[12, 17]","This film remake of ""The Time Machine"", an adaptation of the H.G. Wells novel of the same name, is enhanced by Dreamworks' digitalized, special effects wizardry. It lacks, however, the intelligent handling of its 1960 predecessor, a science fiction film classic, which starred the very virile and testosterone charged Rod Taylor and the ethereally beautiful Yvette Mimieux in the lead roles. Instead, we now  get a seriously emaciated Guy Pearce (hand him a Big Mac, for Pete's sake) and the pretty, but tepid, Samantha Mumba.In this version, Alexander Hartdegan (Guy Pearce) has lost the woman he loves in a pointless murder. Depressed, he tinkers with the construction of a time machine for years, hoping to go back in time to right what went wrong. What he discovers is that though he can go back and make some changes, the end result is always the same. In an attempt to obtain a resolution of this paradox, he travels into the future. In his quest for answer, he has an accident that causes him to go hundreds of thousands of years into the future.There, he encounters a dual society, that of the aggressive Morlocks, the hunters, and that of the peaceful Eloi, the hunted. The Eloi are a group of humans that defy racial typing, as they all seem multi-racial, which is, in and of itself, one of the most interesting ideas in this remake and virtually its only social commentary. The Morlocks are a  frightening society, totally monstrous in appearance. Their overlord, well played by an albinoesque Jeremy Irons, is suitably menacing.Mara (Samantha Mumba), an Eloi lovely, takes care of the injured Alexander when he first arrives. When the Morlocks go into attack mode and Mara is taken captive, Alexander (Guy Pearce) goes into superhero mode to the rescue. Guy Pearce as an action hero? I think not. Guy Pearce, who has given excellent performances in other films, is ill suited for the role of Alexander and his acting in the part reflects this. Moreover, while Samantha Mumba is lovely to look at, she exhibits very little acting ability.It is unfortunate that the screenplay left H.G. Wells story' by the wayside, deciding to fix what ain't broke. In doing so, they constructed a story that does not work that well, losing much of the tension inherent in the original film. The film's only saving grace, apart from the specal effects, is the dazzling homesite of the Eloi, cocoons built onto a canyon wall, which are just beautiful.Don't buy this remake. Instead, buy the 1960 version. This remake is worth a rental, however, if one is looking for some mindless, moderately enjoyable  entertainment.",3,THE FUTURE AIN'T ALL IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE...,1034985600,"10 19, 2002",2002,2611,"['film', 'remake', 'Time', 'Machine', 'adaptation', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'enhanced', 'Dreamworks', 'digitalized', 'special', 'effects', 'wizardry', 'however', 'intelligent', 'handling', '1960', 'predecessor', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'classic', 'starred', 'very', 'virile', 'testosterone', 'charged', 'Rod', 'Taylor', 'ethereally', 'beautiful', 'Yvette', 'Mimieux', 'lead', 'roles', 'Instead', 'now', 'get', 'seriously', 'emaciated', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'hand', 'Big', 'Mac', 'Pete', 'sake', 'pretty', 'tepid', 'Samantha', 'Mumba.In', 'version', 'Alexander', 'Hartdegan', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'lost', 'woman', 'pointless', 'murder', 'Depressed', 'construction', 'time', 'machine', 'years', 'hoping', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'right', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'What', 'can', 'go', 'back', 'make', 'changes', 'end', 'result', 'always', 'same', 'attempt', 'obtain', 'resolution', 'paradox', 'future', 'quest', 'answer', 'accident', 'go', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'years', 'future.There', 'dual', 'society', 'aggressive', 'Morlocks', 'hunters', 'peaceful', 'Eloi', 'hunted', 'Eloi', 'are', 'group', 'humans', 'defy', 'racial', 'typing', 'seem', 'multi-racial', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'remake', 'virtually', 'only', 'social', 'commentary', 'Morlocks', 'are', 'frightening', 'society', 'totally', 'monstrous', 'appearance', 'overlord', 'well', 'played', 'albinoesque', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'suitably', 'menacing.Mara', 'Samantha', 'Mumba', 'Eloi', 'lovely', 'care', 'injured', 'Alexander', 'when', 'first', 'When', 'Morlocks', 'go', 'attack', 'mode', 'Mara', 'taken', 'captive', 'Alexander', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'superhero', 'mode', 'rescue', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'action', 'hero', 'think', 'not', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'who', 'given', 'excellent', 'performances', 'other', 'films', 'ill', 'suited', 'role', 'Alexander', 'acting', 'part', 'Moreover', 'Samantha', 'Mumba', 'lovely', 'look', 'very', 'little', 'acting', 'ability.It', 'unfortunate', 'screenplay', 'left', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'story', 'wayside', 'deciding', 'fix', 'what', 'ai', ""n't"", 'broke', 'doing', 'so', 'constructed', 'story', 'not', 'work', 'that', 'well', 'losing', 'much', 'tension', 'inherent', 'original', 'film', 'film', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'apart', 'specal', 'effects', 'dazzling', 'homesite', 'Eloi', 'cocoons', 'built', 'canyon', 'wall', 'are', 'just', 'beautiful.Do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'remake', 'Instead', 'buy', '1960', 'version', 'remake', 'rental', 'however', 'one', 'looking', 'mindless', 'moderately', 'enjoyable', 'entertainment']",N/A

588338,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00005JKLZ,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[3, 5]","We get to ask a question in this movie that seems to plague our movie industry:  Just because you can make a movie over again, should you?  In the case of this movie, the original was made in 1960 and starred Rod Taylor, Yvette Mimieux, Alan Young and Sebastian Cabot and is now considered a classic George Pal movie.  The special effects then, as now, were state of the art and brilliantly accomplished.  Furthermore, the central theme of the story then was the promise of mankind and civilization, and George's desire to be a part of the propagation of mankind.The story:  Instead of George Wells being the central character, we have Guy Pearce, who you might recognize from ""The Count of Monte Cristo"", playing Alexander Hartdegen, an inventor who notes in an off-handed way that he knows a clerk by the name of Einstein who has ""good ideas"".  Alexander has always been a misfit, as most geniuses are, and when his fiance tragically dies, he feels guilty and drives to create a time machine.  He accidentally ends up in a far future where the moon has been destroyed, which caused the destruction of civilization, and the subsequent evolution into Eloi, Morlocks, and a being that controls the Morlocks.The real star of the movie is the special effects.  The village where the Eloi live is very creative.  The art of the Eloi is stunning.  The underground scenes in the Morlock caverns are suitably dark and forbidding.  However, while the Morlocks are bigger and scarier than the 1960s Morlocks, I found the 1960s version more believable.  Smaller size is an advantage in the underground.  Sensitivity to light is a natural side-effect of underground living.  Furthermore, if the Morlocks has lived underground for millennia, then their eyes would have evolved to see better in dim light conditions, which should have made them much less tolerable of outside light.  Of course the implausibilities stretch even further than that, with Morlocks performing physical feats that seem to defy physics as we know it, and how does that time machine always seem to end up above ground on a flat spot?I was also less pleased with Hartdegen's motivations.  George's motivations in the original were the destiny of mankind and the goal of civilization.  Hartdegen's motivations seem to be to find a woman and settle down creating huge three dimensional sculptures in the far future.  The equivalent in the present would be that someone creates a device that changes society for all time to come, and their goal was to buy a double wide and be able to drink a six-pack a night, while not having to work.I was expecting an intelligent thought-provoking movie equivalent to the 1960 version.  Instead I got a fairly mindless action adventure movie that had all of the flaws of the original with all new flaws added.  While the special effects are excellent, they do not overcome the weak plot.  I was somewhat disappointed.  This movie turns out to be a one-time watch that requires you to disengage your brain before watching.

588340,A34PP1LDB9GNV5,B00005JKLZ,L. Roth,"[1, 2]","I've a confession to make - I'm in this movie as an extra. I'm one of the out of focus musicians on the bandstand in the Central Park scene. (I spent a week of nights freezing my butt off in a park in Schenectady while they filmed it.) That out of the way, I'd like to make some comments.This movie was not as well received as the 60's version. (It's been years since I saw that one, so I can't really compare.) There are several reasons. One is the problem with turning the story into a movie.The original HG Wells epic isn't really a story of any great character depth. The Time Traveler goes into the future, discovers things haven't really worked out for the human race and after some narrow escapes, comes back to tell a few friends about it before disappearing back into time. Plenty of big ideas and a long vista, but not much of a story in personal terms. Basically, it's just a travelogue.The 1960 version took the basic ideas, and turned it into more of an adventure film rather than just a Big Idea story, fleshing out the Time Traveller and making him much more of a person the audience could get emotionally involved with. It was well done and enjoyable to watch - but also had the advantage of presenting a lot of novel ideas and imagery on screen for what was the first time for many people.Fast forward to 2002. Time travel is old hat to audiences; they've grown up seeing it in all kinds of variations, from tragedy to comedy. Ditto for dystrophic post-apocalypse futures. This latest version attempted to refresh the story by giving the hero (And yes, it's also a hero story) much more of a background and motivation to travel in time. Further, it added a complication HG Wells never addressed - the trouble with the paradoxes of time travel.It was a more ambitious storyline, and ultmately, harder to bring off. The bar was higher, the goals were greater, and the end result didn't quite succeed as well as the first movie in putting together a sufficiently satisfactory conclusion.The other thing that happened is the future changed drastically between filming the movie and releasing it. There was supposed to be a scene showing New York City being destroyed by huge chunks of falling space debris, including the Twin Towers. Before they could release the movie, 9-11 happened, and there was no way they could let it go into the theaters after that. Months of delay and some re-working followed, and they never quite gave it the promotion it needed.All that being said, if you've never seen the George Pal version, and just watch it for the story you see on the screen, it's not the worst way to spend a little time. The scenes in 1899 are fantastic; NYC a bit over a hundred years later ain't too shabby (the first scene with Orlando Jones is a hoot), and the special effects are quite enjoyable.Some day, I'm hoping they will release a version restoring the footage that had to be cut; I'm still wondering how they had to change the movie to work around that, and what it might have done to the overall result. Just for fun, if you can find someone who has never seen either film version nor read the book, I'd like to know how they'd react to the 2 films if they saw the Simon Wells version first, and the George Pal version second.",3,The Future isn't what it used to be,1143244800,"03 25, 2006",2006,3256,"[""'ve"", 'confession', 'make', ""'m"", 'movie', 'extra', ""'m"", 'one', 'out', 'focus', 'musicians', 'bandstand', 'Central', 'Park', 'scene', 'spent', 'week', 'nights', 'freezing', 'butt', 'off', 'park', 'Schenectady', 'filmed', 'way', ""'d"", 'like', 'make', 'comments.This', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'received', '60', 'version', 'been', 'years', 'saw', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'compare', 'are', 'several', 'reasons', 'One', 'problem', 'turning', 'story', 'movie.The', 'original', 'HG', 'Wells', 'epic', ""n't"", 'really', 'story', 'great', 'character', 'depth', 'Time', 'Traveler', 'future', 'discovers', 'things', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'worked', 'out', 'human', 'race', 'narrow', 'escapes', 'back', 'tell', 'few', 'friends', 'disappearing', 'back', 'time', 'Plenty', 'big', 'ideas', 'long', 'vista', 'not', 'much', 'story', 'personal', 'terms', 'Basically', 'just', 'travelogue.The', '1960', 'version', 'took', 'basic', 'ideas', 'turned', 'more', 'adventure', 'film', 'rather', 'just', 'Big', 'Idea', 'story', 'fleshing', 'out', 'Time', 'Traveller', 'making', 'much', 'more', 'person', 'audience', 'could', 'get', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'also', 'had', 'advantage', 'presenting', 'lot', 'novel', 'ideas', 'imagery', 'screen', 'what', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'many', 'people.Fast', 'forward', '2002', 'Time', 'travel', 'old', 'hat', 'audiences', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'up', 'seeing', 'kinds', 'variations', 'tragedy', 'comedy', 'Ditto', 'dystrophic', 'post-apocalypse', 'futures', 'latest', 'version', 'attempted', 'refresh', 'story', 'giving', 'hero', 'yes', 'also', 'hero', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'background', 'motivation', 'travel', 'time', 'Further', 'added', 'complication', 'HG', 'Wells', 'never', 'addressed', 'trouble', 'paradoxes', 'time', 'travel.It', 'was', 'more', 'ambitious', 'storyline', 'ultmately', 'harder', 'bring', 'off', 'bar', 'was', 'higher', 'goals', 'were', 'greater', 'end', 'result', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'succeed', 'as', 'well', 'first', 'movie', 'putting', 'together', 'sufficiently', 'satisfactory', 'conclusion.The', 'other', 'thing', 'happened', 'future', 'changed', 'drastically', 'filming', 'movie', 'releasing', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'scene', 'showing', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'being', 'destroyed', 'huge', 'chunks', 'falling', 'space', 'debris', 'including', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'could', 'release', 'movie', '9-11', 'happened', 'was', 'way', 'could', 'let', 'go', 'theaters', 'Months', 'delay', 're-working', 'followed', 'never', 'quite', 'gave', 'promotion', 'being', 'said', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'George', 'Pal', 'version', 'just', 'watch', 'story', 'see', 'screen', 'not', 'worst', 'way', 'spend', 'little', 'time', 'scenes', '1899', 'are', 'fantastic', 'bit', 'hundred', 'years', 'later', 'ai', ""n't"", 'too', 'shabby', 'first', 'scene', 'Orlando', 'Jones', 'hoot', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'quite', 'enjoyable.Some', 'day', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'will', 'release', 'version', 'restoring', 'footage', 'had', 'be', 'cut', ""'m"", 'still', 'wondering', 'how', 'had', 'change', 'movie', 'work', 'around', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'overall', 'result', 'Just', 'fun', 'can', 'find', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'version', 'read', 'book', ""'d"", 'like', 'know', 'how', ""'d"", 'react', '2', 'films', 'saw', 'Simon', 'Wells', 'version', 'first', 'George', 'Pal', 'version', 'second']",N/A

This is a bright, hopeful movie that seems a little pointless and too short to really give us much of a story. It wastes time playing with the machine itself and less time in the future. Running just barely an hour and a half, this provides a few cheap thrills, but nothing more. Guy Pearce plays the time traveler who loses his wife and wants to go back in time to save her. The book didn't waste its time with this subplot, and instead went straight to the future. This movie should've done that, but it wants a love story, so who cares. Finally he goes to the future and sees that man has separated into two species, the Eloi and the Morlocks. Morlocks live underground and feast on the Eloi. Eloi are peaceful people who are innocent and unaware of the Morlocks. Guy Pearce wants to fight the Morlocks, who have stolen the time machine. We get what's supposed to be a villain, but really he's just doing what evolution has brought him to do. But I'm putting too much thought into a film that doesn't want to think at all. A shame.

It doesn't look like there is a version available on Blu-ray for any adaptation of The Time Machine. This movie was based on the novel by H.G. Wells. It also had a 1960 film adaptation (which remains superior). This 2002 film is now out of print on DVD. That's amazing for such an iconic story. The remake has a great cast (Guy Pearce, Jeremy Irons, Samantha Mumba) but this film has many failings too. The score is memorable and wonderful. Some of the special effects shots work but not all. Pearce travels into the far future where humans (Eloi) are being used as food for a dominant species living underground (Morlocks). The story is fairly close to the original with a few exceptions (notably the visit to a library in the future and the ending).The main problems are casting Orlando Jones as a computerized librarian, Morlock attacks in the daytime and some badly edited sequences. As in all classic sci-fi tales the story comes across as old-fashioned to modern audiences but this version makes little attempt to push it to the next level anyway. Some have complained the relationship between Alexander and Mara doesn't come across since he just fell into the village and ends up sleeping platonically in her house. There are lots of little things that are problematic. The Eloi backstory isn't developed properly. Some of the special effects look great while others don't. One thing that always bugged me was Pearce running back into the time machine after being arrested in the future. The scene needlessly cuts to what looks like a stuntwoman in a red cape running along before Alexander jumps into the time machine and gets knocked unconscious. The ending has been changed and doesn't really tie up loose ends. Hopefully we get a deluxe Blu-ray with 4 hours of bonus content one day.

What's worse is that it was received so poorly that we'll have wait another forty-two years, at least, before someone else attempts a remake. Yes, it is a movie about a guy who builds a time machine and travels into the future from the late 19th century, there are creatures called Morlocks and the time machine was made out of brass parts, beyond that, this film bears about as much semblance to the original as a tea leaf does to the entire East India Company, (Thank you, Douglas Adams).If there were no book entitled `The Time Machine' by H.G. Wells, I might have given it three stars, but because it plays so fast and loose with its logic and pacing that another rewrite or three might have been in order. Plus for a guy capable of building a device that can move through time with 19th century technology, he has about as much of a grasp of temporal causality as a concussed bee, (Again, thank you Mr. Adams). This fine English...er, American gentleman Alexander (Guy Pierce), an associate professor at Columbia university does all of this because his lady love Emma is meant to die. First she gets shot by a mugger, so he goes back in time to move her away from that event to a New York street corner away from the park. Where she promptly gets run over by a runaway horse and carriage. If that doesn't convince one that something is not meant to be, then nothing will. Bright boy then decides that since going back in time doesn't seem to solve anything, going into the future might.Right.The only problem is, that's already one-third of the movie. He travels ahead to 2032 where mankind has moved into space and are building vacation spots on the moon. Unfortunately, mankind is as capable of excavating land on the moon as our hero is at understand temporal causality. Mankind blows up the moon- cracks it right in half and gravity being what it is sends a lot of it crashing into the planet. Does our hero Alexander go back in time to try and prevent this? No. Why? Probably because he's realized that he can't, so after a bump on a noggin that renders him insensate...more so, he's slung 802,701 years into the future. Yes, the special effects of the passage of time are nothing short of brilliant and the epochal time lapse is stunning, too bad it's in this dung heap of a film.He awakens under the care of an Eloi woman, Mara (Samantha Mumba) who is of course exotic and beautiful, which also means that she's doomed. As another reviewer correctly pointed out, for some reason they speak English 800,000 years from now. No reason for this, they do it to remember the past times. Just why they do it is never explained. The cliff dwelling Eloi are nothing but prey animals for the Morlocks, who we learn cannot stand daylight. We learn this only after we see them hunting by day. Next we meet big bad brain boy king daddy Morlock, played by Jeremy Irons, who is of course a telepathic/telekinetic god and has nefarious plans for our sumptuous Eloi lady. He has also learned where the time machine is, had it brought to his underground estate, and plans to use it. Of course if he was as smart as he appeared to be, he would know that going into the past is pointless and he could only effectively carry forward into the future.As much of a cinematic stinkburger as this film is, it does have its good points, few that they are. The Vox (Orlando Jones), the holographic computer that Alexander meets in 2037 at the New York Public Library is wonderful, especially when met 800,000 years in the future. He is sad, almost insane, contrasting the Eloi who have no knowledge of the past and no ambition of the future. The Vox remembers everything. The imagery is quite stunning, especially the beautiful cliff-side dwellings of the Eloi and have a wonderful organic look to them. Guy Pierce as Alexander is also quite likeable- he is heroic, compassionate and decent. Plus the Fellowship of the Rings Orc-like underground lair of the Morlocks is fantastic, as are the Morlocks themselves, despite the rather illogical premise of their existence, that of not being able to tolerate the light, yet hunting by day.So ten out of ten for purely visual quality, but the story is so lacking that it all but wrecks the rest of the film. The pacing is all wrong- the end meeting with the villain takes place in a single chamber within the Morlock lair- no drawn out conflict between the Eloi. Heck, I would have even approved of Alexander had organized the Eloi to fight back against them, but his meeting with the Uber-Morlock was just too short.

588346,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B00005JKLZ,Martin Asiner,"[35, 45]","It may be unfair, but a remake of a hit movie must always be compared to the original.  The 1960 original of THE TIME MACHINE was a deserved hit.  The 2002 version may be a treat for the eyes, but unfortunately, not for the brain.  Part of the problem is that Simon Wells, the great-grandson of H. G. Wells, directed the movie as if he were more entranced with dazzling special effects (and dazzling they are) than with bringing out a believable, fully fleshed series of characters.  In 1960, director George Pal wisely kept the focus squarely on the hero's adventures and why he helped the human Eloi.  In 2002, Simon Wells clearly loved the image of leaping, loping half-humans that he had seen in previous sci-fi movies.  The supporting cast in the age of the time traveler (David Pearce) did not do very much to point out his character.  His girlfiend Emma (Sienna Guillory) was in the film only to motivate him to build a time machine to alter the past to avoid her death. One would think that such a clumsy device would not be sufficient by itself to galvanize the time traveller.  In the original, Rod Taylor's scientific curiosity with time was quite sufficient a motivation.The real hero of the movie is the special effects co-ordinator.  The images of one day melding into the next are memorable.  Further, the appearance of the Morlocks as a cross between man and fish stuns the senses.  Jeremy Irons disappoints as the Morlocks leader.  As Irons pontificates on the split between Eloi and Morlocks, the viewer can see under the pasty-white makeup and hear the Irons from DIE HARD III lecturing Bruce Willis on similar such claptrap.  Further, the ending, which I shall not divulge here, is an incomprehensible mess of weird logic unconnected to resulting effect.  What emerges by the end of the film is the growing realization that Simon Wells ought to have paid less attention to being different from his forebear and more attention to a director who knew how to weave a magical spell that would not get lost in the techo wizardry that passes for the cutting edge in computer special effects.",3,Glitzier Does Not Mean Better,1028937600,"08 10, 2002",2002,2105,"['may', 'be', 'unfair', 'remake', 'hit', 'movie', 'must', 'always', 'be', 'compared', 'original', '1960', 'original', 'THE', 'TIME', 'MACHINE', 'was', 'deserved', 'hit', '2002', 'version', 'may', 'be', 'treat', 'eyes', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'brain', 'Part', 'problem', 'Simon', 'Wells', 'great-grandson', 'H.', 'G.', 'Wells', 'directed', 'movie', 'were', 'more', 'entranced', 'dazzling', 'special', 'effects', 'dazzling', 'are', 'bringing', 'out', 'believable', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'series', 'characters', '1960', 'director', 'George', 'Pal', 'wisely', 'kept', 'focus', 'squarely', 'hero', 'adventures', 'why', 'helped', 'human', 'Eloi', '2002', 'Simon', 'Wells', 'clearly', 'loved', 'image', 'leaping', 'loping', 'half-humans', 'had', 'seen', 'previous', 'sci-fi', 'movies', 'supporting', 'cast', 'age', 'time', 'traveler', 'David', 'Pearce', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'very', 'much', 'point', 'out', 'character', 'girlfiend', 'Emma', 'Sienna', 'Guillory', 'was', 'film', 'only', 'motivate', 'build', 'time', 'machine', 'alter', 'past', 'avoid', 'death', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'clumsy', 'device', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'sufficient', 'galvanize', 'time', 'traveller', 'original', 'Rod', 'Taylor', 'scientific', 'curiosity', 'time', 'was', 'quite', 'sufficient', 'motivation.The', 'real', 'hero', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'co-ordinator', 'images', 'one', 'day', 'melding', 'next', 'are', 'memorable', 'Further', 'appearance', 'Morlocks', 'cross', 'man', 'fish', 'stuns', 'senses', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'disappoints', 'Morlocks', 'leader', 'Irons', 'split', 'Eloi', 'Morlocks', 'viewer', 'can', 'see', 'pasty-white', 'makeup', 'hear', 'Irons', 'DIE', 'HARD', 'III', 'lecturing', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'similar', 'such', 'claptrap', 'Further', 'ending', 'shall', 'not', 'divulge', 'here', 'incomprehensible', 'mess', 'weird', 'logic', 'unconnected', 'resulting', 'effect', 'What', 'end', 'film', 'growing', 'realization', 'Simon', 'Wells', 'ought', 'have', 'paid', 'less', 'attention', 'being', 'different', 'forebear', 'more', 'attention', 'director', 'who', 'knew', 'how', 'weave', 'magical', 'spell', 'would', 'not', 'get', 'lost', 'techo', 'wizardry', 'cutting', 'edge', 'computer', 'special', 'effects']",N/A
588347,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JKLZ,Matthew Horner,"[19, 23]","""The Time Machine"" is loosely based on H.G. Wells' sci-fi masterpiece, written in 1897. The book was also made into a movie forty years ago [available on DVD at Amazon.com]. Back then, the major studios had decided to cash in on the craze created by independent, low-budget sci-fi and horror films. MGM, for example, produced ""The Time Machine"" as well as ""Forbidden Planet"". These pictures - sleeker and glossier than anything the independents could make - used what were, at the time, state-of-the-art special effects. Today's version of the Wells classic utilizes the same tools. While the results are at times spectacular, it lacks a key ingredient - a dash of intelligence - that made the earlier version more memorable.The time is the very end of the 19th Century. The place is New York. Alexander Hartegen [Guy Pearce] is a brilliant, absent-minded professor of science who is madly in love. When his fianc&eacute;e dies tragically, he feels somehow responsible. Sequestering himself in his laboratory for four years, he builds a time machine. His plan is to go back, change the past and prevent his lover's death. When this fails, he realizes that any answer lies in the future. He travels to the New York of the mid-21st Century where he finds the planet in the midst of a catastrophe. The moon is breaking apart, and chunks of it are plummeting to Earth. In this melee he is knocked unconscious and awakens 800,000 years in the future. There he finds that the moon's destruction has caused mankind to split into two different species - one beautiful, innocent and benign, the other hideous and very dangerous.As a fast-paced, mindless adventure, ""The Time Machine"" frequently succeeds. To truly enjoy it, you simply have to leave your sense of logic behind. The time travel sequences are beautifully rendered, although the fact that the machine always manages to wind up in the same spot is beyond ludicrous. The creatures who prey upon the pretty people of the future are deliciously gross and mean, but the way they move is not only obviously computer-generated but also in defiance of all know laws of gravity and of physics. Some of the people still speak English, which has not changed one bit in all those years. Think about how it's changed in just the last few hundred years. Archeological remnants of the past, which have apparently sat outside for 8,000 centuries, seem perfectly preserved. And, as to what would REALLY happen to the planet if the moon fell apart, let's not even go there.Maybe it's just me, but sometimes it seems as though the smarter computers get, the dumber action/adventure and sci-fi movies become. It's as though the filmmakers are so infatuated with the gadgets and electronic wizardry that they forget all about the script.

588348,A3PR4ZSBDUL4EG,B00005JKLZ,"Matthew S. Schweitzer ""zohoe""","[8, 10]","Simon Wells' ""Time Machine"" is an ambitious F/X laden re-make of the original sci-fi classic starring Rod Taylor as a time traveller who witnesses the destruction of civilization and travels 800,000 years into the future to find that mankind has survived a planetary catastrophe, but has in the process evolved into two speperate species, the submissive Eloi and the cannabalistic Morlocks.  This new adaptation sticks closer to the 1960 film far more than H.G. Wells' classic novel, but despite the great sets, special effects, and Samantha Mumba's skimpy outfit, something is desperately missing from this outting.Guy Pearce stars as Alexander Hartdegan, an eccentric physics professor from turn-of-the-century New York City who becomes obsessed with building a time machine after the tragic death of his fiance.  Despite his attempts to travel back in time to save his love from death, he finds that he cannot change the past, and thus embarks on a journey into the future to find the answer as to why.  After a brief stop-over in 2030 NYC, he witnesses the destruction of civilization as the Moon, blown asunder by a nuclear accident, rains down upon the earth and virtually wipes out mankind.  He accidentally travels forward 800,000 years into the future only to find that, as in the original, humans have now evolved into two seperate species.  It is here that the film loses it's energy and becomes bogged down in typical action fare and overblown special effects that tend to overpower and kill the story.  While undeniably amazing, unfortunately, special effects do not make a good story.  The film also suffers from a few big plot holes that are hard to ignore.  For example, after only what is essentially a few hours of time travelling, Hartdegen seems to have completely forgotten his obsessive love for his dead fiance and falls for the beautiful Eloi woman Mara.  Would someone who was so driven and grief-striken as our hero seems to be for the loss of his true love manage to totally forget about her in the course of a few hours or days?  The film also feels as if it loses pacing in the middle, as if needed scenes are missing.  Certain scenes ARE missing regarding the destruction of Earth during the fall of the Moon.  These key scenes were cut in post-production after September 11 because they showed NYC being destroyed in a fiery rain of meteorites.  I feel that these scenes may have helped add something to the film as it is never really made clear what happened that caused the destruction of the earth, as we are basically given a quick shot of the break-up of the Moon and the chaos that ensues, but the emotional tie-in that SHOULD be there is lost.  In the original film, when Rod Taylor witnesses the destruction of his beloved London during a atomic attack, we feel the terror and awe of the destruction of all civilization, as it truly is the end of the world as we know it.  ""The labor of centuries...gone in an instant!""  It illustrates man's frailty and transience in this world, how we hang precariously from a weak branch despite our belief in our own invulnerablity. But here, we get no such emotionally charge event, nothing to show the terror that anyone who witnesses the anihilation of the world as he knows it would experience.  In losing this we lose something else that seems to leave the story lifeless as it degenerates into a Planet of the Apes rehash.Despite a strong opening, the Time Machine loses its momentum in the last half and we are left, once again, wanting something more.",3,OK...But Could Have Been Alot Better,1027900800,"07 29, 2002",2002,3535,"['Simon', 'Wells', 'Time', 'Machine', 'ambitious', 'F/X', 'laden', 're-make', 'original', 'sci-fi', 'classic', 'starring', 'Rod', 'Taylor', 'time', 'traveller', 'who', 'destruction', 'civilization', '800,000', 'years', 'future', 'find', 'mankind', 'survived', 'planetary', 'catastrophe', 'process', 'evolved', 'two', 'speperate', 'species', 'submissive', 'Eloi', 'cannabalistic', 'Morlocks', 'new', 'adaptation', 'sticks', 'closer', '1960', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'classic', 'novel', 'great', 'sets', 'special', 'effects', 'Samantha', 'Mumba', 'skimpy', 'outfit', 'something', 'desperately', 'missing', 'outting.Guy', 'Pearce', 'stars', 'Alexander', 'Hartdegan', 'eccentric', 'physics', 'professor', 'turn-of-the-century', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'who', 'obsessed', 'building', 'time', 'machine', 'tragic', 'death', 'fiance', 'attempts', 'travel', 'back', 'time', 'save', 'love', 'death', 'can', 'not', 'change', 'past', 'thus', 'embarks', 'journey', 'future', 'find', 'answer', 'why', 'brief', 'stop-over', '2030', 'NYC', 'destruction', 'civilization', 'Moon', 'blown', 'asunder', 'nuclear', 'accident', 'down', 'earth', 'virtually', 'out', 'mankind', 'accidentally', 'forward', '800,000', 'years', 'future', 'only', 'find', 'original', 'humans', 'have', 'now', 'evolved', 'two', 'seperate', 'species', 'here', 'film', 'energy', 'bogged', 'down', 'typical', 'action', 'fare', 'overblown', 'special', 'effects', 'tend', 'overpower', 'kill', 'story', 'undeniably', 'amazing', 'unfortunately', 'special', 'effects', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'good', 'story', 'film', 'also', 'few', 'big', 'plot', 'holes', 'are', 'hard', 'ignore', 'example', 'only', 'what', 'essentially', 'few', 'hours', 'time', 'travelling', 'Hartdegen', 'have', 'completely', 'forgotten', 'obsessive', 'love', 'dead', 'fiance', 'beautiful', 'Eloi', 'woman', 'Mara', 'Would', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'driven', 'grief-striken', 'hero', 'be', 'loss', 'true', 'love', 'manage', 'totally', 'forget', 'course', 'few', 'hours', 'days', 'film', 'also', 'pacing', 'middle', 'needed', 'scenes', 'are', 'missing', 'Certain', 'scenes', 'ARE', 'missing', 'regarding', 'destruction', 'Earth', 'fall', 'Moon', 'key', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'post-production', 'September', '11', 'showed', 'NYC', 'being', 'destroyed', 'fiery', 'rain', 'meteorites', 'feel', 'scenes', 'may', 'have', 'helped', 'add', 'something', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'made', 'clear', 'what', 'happened', 'caused', 'destruction', 'earth', 'are', 'basically', 'given', 'quick', 'shot', 'break-up', 'Moon', 'chaos', 'emotional', 'tie-in', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'lost', 'original', 'film', 'when', 'Rod', 'Taylor', 'destruction', 'beloved', 'London', 'atomic', 'attack', 'feel', 'terror', 'awe', 'destruction', 'civilization', 'end', 'world', 'know', 'labor', 'centuries', 'gone', 'instant', 'man', 'frailty', 'transience', 'world', 'how', 'hang', 'precariously', 'weak', 'branch', 'belief', 'own', 'invulnerablity', 'here', 'get', 'such', 'emotionally', 'charge', 'event', 'nothing', 'show', 'terror', 'anyone', 'who', 'anihilation', 'world', 'would', 'experience', 'losing', 'lose', 'something', 'else', 'leave', 'story', 'lifeless', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'rehash.Despite', 'strong', 'opening', 'Time', 'Machine', 'momentum', 'last', 'half', 'are', 'left', 'once', 'again', 'wanting', 'something', 'more']",N/A
588349,A2A3GTGNPCRFFE,B00005JKLZ,Maximillian Ben Hanan,"[4, 5]","I'm a big fan of classic science fiction, be it H.G. Wells, Jules Verne, or their more modern contemporaries like Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury. Keeping that in mind, I was greatly disappointed to miss ""The Time Machine"" while it aired at the movie theater. Now that I've rented the film, I no longer regret missing it at the theater. In a nutshell, the film is a gorgeous piece of eye candy, but not too much more. Wooden acting and a slow plot kept this film from being a commercial success. Only serious ""Time Machine"" fans like me could find some value with the movie and even that was difficult.PROs:- The film's special effects for the Morlocks were outstanding. I've never seen a visual representation of them that was so well done. They were truly creepy.- The Eloi were also well done. I really got the impression of a Utopian society of nave children. The special effects directors drew inspiration from Native American culture heavily in their representation of the Eloi.- Parts of the film have a campy feel to them that I found appealing. The movie's explanation of the world's destruction (moon shattered by a nuclear accident), reminded me heavily of the old ""Planet of the Ape's"" movies or the Kurt Russell film ""Escape From New York.""- Jeremy Iron's depiction of the evil Morlock mastermind was a masterful performance. If you can't get the creeps from his performance, it's likely you never will!- Samantha Mumba, who plays Mara, the exotic Eloi beauty was very easy on the eyes. She's a beautiful woman.CONs:- The story is very LOOSLEY based on the wonderful H.G. Well's science fiction book of the same name. It trades in H.G. Wells's social commentary for an action movie plot and then fails to deliver.- The story is very hard to believe, even being science fiction. The Eloi of the future still speak English despite a world disaster and centuries if not millennia of change. Suspend your belief or you're in for a hard ride.- Until the Morlocks appear in the film, the plot is EXTREMELY slow. My roommate and I almost fell asleep watching it (In fact I did, but he woke me up.).- Orlando Jones, who plays Vox, a sort of holographic librarian, from the future puts a very weak display of acting forward. The role is a serious one, but Orlando still tries to inject too much of his comedy into it. The end result was that he appeared silly rather than humorous.- Guy Pierce is uninspiring. He also looks like he could use a meal the whole film with sunken cheeks that make him look curiously primate like (anyone in the mood for ""Planet of the Apes?""). My roommate was inspired to make monkey noises several times during the film thanks to Pierce's odd appearance and even odder acting. Guy Pierce was much better in ""L.A. Confidential.""I recommend the movie for someone looking for great special effects, but not for a fan of the H.G. Wells novel, ""The Time Machine."" In other words, the movie is great eye candy, but don't expect any intellectual stimulation.I greatly prefer the 1960 film version of ""The Time Machine"" with Rod Taylor. It had much more primitive special effects, but kept a much better plot and stayed much more accurately to the plot line from the H.G.

Having read the book, I was surprised at how very different the movie was. Basic concepts are adhered to, but the story is drastically different. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as the book was rather sparse in characterization.This has some romance at the beginning, between the time-traveler and the woman he loves. When she dies in an accident, he uses the time-machine to go back and try to prevent her death, only she dies again in a different way, showing that some things just don't change. This entire story arc was never in the book, though.Weena of the Eloi (and the rest of the Eloi) are rather childlike in the book, but in this movie, the Eloi are intelligent people even if the society is somewhat primitive (technology was destroyed, so the people had to start over) and the Morlocks are also intelligent (at least the leaders/higher-ups are). Several important scenes from the book are eliminated.Some people won't like how the story was fleshed-out and altered, but I for one think the movie was good.

Why does everyone have to compare them? Why can't this movie just stand alone by itself, without being compared to its predecessors? Having done some hard looking, I haven't seen a good review about this movie. This is a great movie, which stands alone by itself, and is Back To The Future, and Mummy Returns (you'll see why later) all rolled into one.I wanted to get this movie, because I heard a lot about Samantha Mumba giving up music for this (she's an Irish singer, and a few hits over here, by the same guy who managed Westlife & Boyzone, Louis Walsh). There's so much hoo-ha about singers-turning-actors and actors-turning-singers. Everyone wants to criticise them. Frankly, all the guys will like Samantha in this, as at one point she's running in a very see through midriff-bearing top, and obviously they didn't have bras in 800,000 AD or whatever it was. It's like Baywatch all over again! Also, I vaguely remember Guy Pearce from Neighbours - or maybe I don't, it's that long ago, and I was so young, I probably remember clips shown on TV later on. I've never seen him in a movie, never seen LA Confidential, or anything else he may have been in. All I know is, especially in the earlier scenes of the movie, and particularly in profile, he looks like an ape! His whole face seems to jut forward, and gives a likeness of an ape.I found this movie really sad, especially when he's trying to stop his girlfriend from being killed, you know it's gonna happen. But you know by just seeing Samantha, she's be the pretty chick in this, who'll mend his broken heart, or some love-sick nonsense.The start of this movie is based in 1899, yet one little thing I'm not very sure about - the fact he carries a locket necklace thing, with a COLOUR photo in it. In 1899? It could have been a painting I suppose, but not that small.Guy Pearce is brilliant in this. Although I much prefer him when he has shaggy hair and stubble, as it lessens the ape-like effect. And he just so happens to get his shirt off when he arrives in 800,000. Nothing wrong with that. He is awfully gaunt around the face though.Watch out for almost comedy performances from Mark Addy & Orlando Jones - both very funny, and should have had bigger roles.The reason why I mentioned the Mummy Returns earlier, was because the Morlocks characters, created by Stan Winston, reminded me of bigger pygmies from Mummy Returns! They had the same facial shapes and everything. Although I did think they were cute! Not scary in the slightest.There's not many extras on this, considering what they could have possibly done with it. There were three trailers (teaser, theatrical & international), so I was in my element with those! There were also: a commentary by director, producer, editor and visual effects supervisor; deleted scenes; featurettes: ""Creating The Time Machine"", ""Creating the Morlocks"" and storyboards.I wish people would look at these films with comparing them to previous movies. It really doesn't give this terrific movie a chance. I enjoyed it.

However, it played out beautifully on my combo DVD/VHS player (no wonder I paid so little?). So, no harm done.I've read a lot of negative reviews about this remake, comparing it to the Rod Taylor 1960 original.  I don't get it.  The original is a great classic (I first saw it as a child in the early '60's; I own it now); however, this new version has a nice twist on the storyline, as well as beautiful special effects--especially the Eloi Cliff Village, which is amazing to see (I'd frame a poster of it if I could get hold of one).Orlando Jones is absolutely perfect as a holographic encyclopedia who, through the centuries, remains stoically hopeful and ever eager to impart all he knows to any who will listen and learn.  Jeremy Irons, although thoroughly evil, is somehow deserving of our sympathy--unlike any 1960 Morlock.  Samatha Mumba and her real-life brother acomplish a very passable effort as ""dark-skinned"" Eloi--unlike any 1960 all-blond Eloi, by the way.  Guy Pearce played it as he always does--flawlessly.  And the time machine--the actual prop--is a work of art.If you've seen the old version and loved it, don't feel guilty if, after watching this one, you find some good changes here.  And don't compare the original apples to the latest oranges.  Just enjoy the sights, new storyline, new characters, and traveling through time from the safety of your living room.Yes, this new version does not contain the beautiful (but somehow too-childlike) character of Weena (Tuesday Weld).  Oh, darn!  But that was then.  The new-version Eloi didn't lose their IQ ... they just sort of lost track of time.Caution!  This is not a film for small children.

588356,A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L,B00005JKLZ,Michael Valdivielso,"[2, 3]","The Time Machine, 2002, is called a remake.  I assume people think of it as a remake of the 1960 version.  There is, as many of you know, the BOOK that started it all.  In my review I will compare the 2002 movie to both of these.  I have not had the pleasure of watching the TV movie, or movies, so I can't use those in my reviews.  There will be spoilers.The movie, as pointed out, came out in 2002, and the DVD around 2003.  The special effects are mostly computer generated and don't come out too well on the TV screen - at least not mine.  The movie, as you can guess, is heavy in computer generated effects.  The problem is, we have seen it all before.  Time travel allows us to see the landscape change, buildings fall into ruins, and organic material rot.  We have seen it before and, in some cases, better than this in other science fiction movies and PBS specials.The plot starts out with more substance then the book or 1960 movie.  The Time Traveler is motivated to change the past.  In fact he works four years on it, doing nothing else and, in fact, going a tad insane with his need to travel back in time.  Why he needs to I will leave unsaid so not to spoil it but it does differ from the book and 1960 movie.  In the book he wants to travel to the future because he wants to.  He is looking for adventure.  In the 1960 movie he is sick of humankind and hopes the future is better.In other words, the 2002 does add more meat to the plot.  But is that helpful?  It does slow it down yet character building always does.He tries to change the past once the machine is finished but fails.  The Traveler comes to understand that changing the past is, maybe not impossible, at least beyond his skills and he decides to go FORWARD in time to find somebody who can help him.  Why he thinks future humans would help him CHANGE his past, and therefore their past, is not a logical flaw as much as it shows how much stress and pressure he is in to carry out his mission.  He has become cold, self-centered, out of touch with the world - it is not bad acting.NOW here comes why I did not give the movie five stars.  The rest of the film becomes a mess of bad science, bad story telling, and just bad...bad.  And here be spoilers.First, we do meet a cool Library Computer, which is really nothing more than what we MAY have later in the 21 Century.  Not only that but the future looks clean, everybody is healthful, and we have people on the Moon.  But then...well, it all goes wrong.First, the Moon is destroyed.  Which seems to happen a lot in sci-fi.  While the film makes it clear it is our fault, it does not make it clear just how.  We know there was a colony on the Moon and we know that we were using it for other reasons, but what happened?  Details people.The Time Traveler moves forward again, finding humans have recovered, in which we all look alike, live in homes on the side of cliffs, and use natural resources to survive.  These people are the Eloi.  Oh, has he found paradise?  No.  Because the human race has split off into two groups.  The Morlocks, creatures who live underground live off the Eloi.  In more ways than one.  This is explained to him by the LIBRARY COMPUTER which has somehow lasted thousands of years.  Poor thing.  But the Time Traveler decides he has to change things - or at least save the hot chick he was growing interested in.  So he invades the Morlocks' underground city.  And is of course captured.Here the Time Traveler finds out that the reason he can not change the past is because to do so means he would never design or build a Time Machine.  So he can NEVER change the past.  Which is funny, because after zipping forward to see the world ruled by the Morlocks, he comes back and changes the past.  But maybe because it was not HIS past but changing his FUTURE, he could get away with it.The end result is a feeling that the story got derailed halfway through the movie.  Or maybe the writers got lazy.  The Time Traveling Scientist becomes a fist-swinging Hero.  The quest to understand time and the nature of it gets pushed to one side as it becomes a simple fight between Good and Evil.  In the book it was evolution that had made two different races, one the cattle, one the butchers.  The 1960 movie tried to stay close to that, adding World Wars to help it along so that the Eloi come out as idiot children and the Morlocks are whip carrying meat eaters.  The Morlocks came out as the bad guys but you did not think of them as EVIL, with a big E.  Maybe evil with a letter e, like an illness or a hose fire.

588359,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,B00005JKLZ,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[3, 4]","As a fan of the original 1960 George Pal movie (starring Rod Taylor) of HG Wells 'The Time Machine' I very much looked forward to seeing this new version on the big screen. Directed by Simon Wells, great grandson of the famous novelist, it promised to be a more faithful recreation of his great grandfather's work but as I was to discover this latest version is actually based on the original movie screenplay and is a bit of a mixed bag.In this latest version, Guy Pearce (Memento, Ravenous, LA Confidential etc.), plays Alexander, an eccentric scientist in 1899, somewhat obsessed with the notion of time travel and pen pal of a certain Albert Einstein. When his beloved fianc&eacute;e Emma (Sienna Guillory) is senselessly murdered, unable to come to terms with her loss, Alexander devotes his life to inventing a time machine so that he can prevent the murder and be reunited with his lost love. Unfortunately however, although he succeeds in building said time machine (aesthetically constructed with lots of polished brass and glass), is he is unable to permanently alter the past. Emotionally devastated once more Alexander, in his anguish plunges forward in time in the hope of finding a better world, to a time where the surviving descendants of mankind have evolved into two separate species and where the timid race, called the Eloi, are hunted by the cannabalistic Morlocks who live underground.There are definitely some good moments in this movie, and indeed much of the first half of the movie is very enjoyable. Guy Pearce is perfectly watchable and the sets and photography are very aesthetically pleasing. In particular, production designer Oliver Scholl has constructed some great sets and the time machine itself is a very impressive improvement on the 1960 Rod Taylor version. Some of the early Morlock scenes are also quite thrilling as they appear and dissapear from the ground, hunting and capturing their Eloi prey. However, there are also quite a few negatives, including an annoying and fairly pointless holographic librarian and a dire last fifteen minutes featuring (a clearly desperate for work) Jeremy Irons as some kind of &uuml;ber-Morlock that has apparently been rolled in flour. In the end, this is just an average movie and certainly no improvement on the original, making it a fairly pointless exercise for all concerned.",3,*** GOOD FIRST HALF LET DOWN BY DIRE ENDING ***,1035331200,"10 23, 2002",2002,2358,"['fan', 'original', '1960', 'George', 'Pal', 'movie', 'starring', 'Rod', 'Taylor', 'HG', 'Wells', 'Time', 'Machine', 'very', 'much', 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'new', 'version', 'big', 'screen', 'Directed', 'Simon', 'Wells', 'great', 'grandson', 'famous', 'novelist', 'promised', 'be', 'more', 'faithful', 'recreation', 'great', 'grandfather', 'work', 'was', 'discover', 'latest', 'version', 'actually', 'based', 'original', 'movie', 'screenplay', 'bit', 'mixed', 'bag.In', 'latest', 'version', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Memento', 'Ravenous', 'LA', 'Confidential', 'etc', 'Alexander', 'eccentric', 'scientist', '1899', 'somewhat', 'obsessed', 'notion', 'time', 'travel', 'pen', 'pal', 'certain', 'Albert', 'Einstein', 'When', 'beloved', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Emma', 'Sienna', 'Guillory', 'senselessly', 'murdered', 'unable', 'come', 'terms', 'loss', 'Alexander', 'life', 'inventing', 'time', 'machine', 'so', 'can', 'prevent', 'murder', 'be', 'reunited', 'lost', 'love', 'Unfortunately', 'however', 'building', 'said', 'time', 'machine', 'aesthetically', 'constructed', 'lots', 'polished', 'brass', 'glass', 'unable', 'permanently', 'alter', 'past', 'Emotionally', 'devastated', 'once', 'more', 'Alexander', 'anguish', 'plunges', 'forward', 'time', 'hope', 'finding', 'better', 'world', 'time', 'where', 'surviving', 'descendants', 'mankind', 'have', 'evolved', 'two', 'separate', 'species', 'where', 'timid', 'race', 'called', 'Eloi', 'are', 'hunted', 'cannabalistic', 'Morlocks', 'who', 'live', 'are', 'definitely', 'good', 'moments', 'movie', 'indeed', 'much', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'perfectly', 'watchable', 'sets', 'photography', 'are', 'very', 'aesthetically', 'pleasing', 'particular', 'production', 'designer', 'Oliver', 'Scholl', 'constructed', 'great', 'sets', 'time', 'machine', 'very', 'impressive', 'improvement', '1960', 'Rod', 'Taylor', 'version', 'early', 'Morlock', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'thrilling', 'appear', 'dissapear', 'ground', 'hunting', 'capturing', 'Eloi', 'prey', 'However', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'few', 'negatives', 'including', 'annoying', 'fairly', 'pointless', 'holographic', 'librarian', 'dire', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'featuring', 'clearly', 'desperate', 'work', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'kind', 'uuml', 'ber-Morlock', 'apparently', 'been', 'rolled', 'flour', 'end', 'just', 'average', 'movie', 'certainly', 'improvement', 'original', 'making', 'fairly', 'pointless', 'exercise', 'concerned']",N/A

The original book was written by H.G. Wells. The Director is the great grandson of the famous author. Therefore, can his vision of the Time Machine be any less creative than the original vision of his great grandfather? Both men created a Science Fiction classic presented through their talent and creative presentation of this concept of travel through time. Both ought to be measured on their own merit individually, and both are quite excellent.Comparisons to the original movie, directed by George Pal and starring Rod Taylor, often discount the simple fact that film artists of the time were constrained by the technology available. It was the vision of a gifted director, and certainly a classic and wonderful adaptation of the H.G. Wells novel. Nevertheless, being different and unique, the new version is beautiful and brilliant.Guy Pearce does a fine job in the lead role of distracted scientist, driven by creative passion to create a machine with which to travel into the past to save his fiance. Finding he could not change the past, seeks to find answers in the future that will enable him to ultimately save her.The special effects sequences are astounding and altogether marvelous. The time machine itself is a construct of pure genius. It is beautiful, brilliant, and astounding in design. The effects seen as centuries pass and the world changes around the time traveller are some of the best special effects ever produced.The purpose of movies is to entertain, and this one delivers in abundance. It is not a remake of George Pal's vision, nor does it conform entirely to the H.G. Wells novel. It is a unique vision of Simon Wells, and viewed on its own merit, is absolutely excellent. The purpose of Science Fiction is to inspire a certain degree of awe and sense of wonder in boldly charging into the unknown. This film does this as deftly as any made in recent years.My only reservation is that English would still be a living language 800,000 years from now. That struck me as highly unlikely. So too the lack of weathering on stones with carved lettering from centuries past. Aside from that small gripe, I found the film to be amazing and wonderful. I was entirely entertained.I give this film 5 stars, and expect to watch it repeatedly over the years and enjoy it many times. It is one of the few made in recent times that one wishes to see again and again. In fact, after seeing it in the theatre twice, I have seen it on DVD 3 times already!

588361,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,B00005JKLZ,Muzzlehatch,"[6, 12]","I would never have re-watched this film if not for a discussion series on Wells I was hosting but....the sacrifices we make. Simon Wells' film has even less to do with his great-grandfather's novel than the 1960 version, in fact changing the whole motivation of the main character so that he can even more readily dispense with any of the philosophizing and social theorizing that has helped to keep the novel still relevant and interesting today.In this film, the setting has been moved from London to New York though it's still the Victorian '90s. Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) is a physics professor about to ask for young Emma's (Sienna Guillory) hand in marriage when she is killed by a mugger. In grief, he sets about inventing a time machine so that he can go back and save her. Wouldn't you? Four years later he's ready, but he quickly finds out that he can't change the past, as that would keep him from building the machine and that would be a paradox. Of course, the paradox of his machine appearing 4 years before it was built in his laboratory or the possibility of him running into himself are never dealt with at all, and this sets up the bad action/thriller pattern in place for the rest of the film: throw logic out the window and when something needs to happen just do it and hope the audience won't notice.He quickly decides to go off into the future. No real reason why -- no discussions of mankind becoming noble and true, as there was in the novel -- nope, he just wants to get out of Dodge apparently. After a longish stop in 2030 where he meets a holographic librarian (Orlando Jones) and somehow glosses over the fact that he apparently died in 1903 - the year he left - and a short one in 2037 as he witnesses the moon break up (cue cool digital effects) he is knocked unconscious on his machine and stays in a daze while the world changes around him, until finally awakening in the year 802,701. Given that 36 minutes have passed by now out of the under 85 (leaving off end credits), you know the action's going to have to come fast and furious and the strangeness and wonder - that still excite this lover of the novel - are going to be in short supply.Suffice it to say that he quickly meets the Eloi, the surface people, led (more or less) by Mara (Samantha Mumba) who is the only adult in the tribe to speak English which is learned by all of them as kids but forgotten by most; she's the teacher though and of course remembers it, can speak intelligibly and is able to lead Hartdegen eventually to the ruins of the library where, miraculously, the electronic librarian still works. But wait, there's a cog in the machinery! Alongside the wonderfully mixed-race Eloi (the sole interesting touch in the film) there's a race of dead-white monstrous super-ape-like thingies, the Morlocks, who are faster, stronger, and like to eat Eloi-flesh. The Eloi of course just accept that their old, feeble, and sometimes others just get taken away - despite being reasonably smart and sophisticated in this version (in the novel and the 1960 film the Eloi are quite feeble and it's not at all surprising that they can't or won't fight back). In short order Mara is captured and our hero has to venture down below where he meets the supreme Morlock, an idiotic conception who can read minds, is super-strong and controls the other Morlocks but who of course gets bested rather quickly by the monkey-faced Pearce/Hartdegen. He's played by Jeremy Irons who I will say seems to enjoy these kinds of cheesy things, at least he's having fun making his big paycheck and probably knows it's crap.And here comes the best/worst part: after dispatching the leader by moving his machine forward in time while super-Morlock is hanging on outside of the machine's ""sphere of safety"" (my words, none of this is ever explained) and aging the Morlock to death in a few seconds, the time traveler comes back, frees Mara, and sets the machine to blow up, which it quickly does, turning all of the Morlocks underground to dust just as the protagonists reach the surface and safety. So, uh, he saves the day by basically blowing up his machine despite not, uh, really possibly knowing what the consequences would be. This, like virtually the whole of the rest of the film, is just thrown at us with no explanation, and now our hero is presumably left to start a new world with the (of course) beautiful and intelligent Mara, having in a few days forgotten all about his past.Pearce is awful, looking like an ugly sad puppy through most of the film and never being remotely convincing as a man of science; Mumba is nice to look at but that's about it. Some of the art direction and sets are kind of cool, but in a very self-conscious way: look, isn't this awesome! Like the Eloi village, a bunch of weird shell-shaped structures on a cliff face that really don't seem feasible or likely. Not that much of anything in the film as a whole seems feasible or likely, for that matter. It's just, rush ahead, and hope nobody notices how stupid it all is.

The motivation of the main character is a pretty dull formula; trying to change the past. As one reviewer said, wouldn't the curiosity of knowing what the future holds be motivation enough? In terms of the science fiction in the story, the notion that there would be anything left of the 19th or even 21st century after almost 1 million years is equally absurd: suddenly the character is able to find the exact location of his home even after the state of New York has transformed into the new Grand Canyon?

The major change they made with the film is giving the Time Traveler both a motivation to build the machine by losing the woman he loves, and the paradox of not being able to go back and save her due to the fact that he wouldn't have built it in the first place if she had lived and married him.Putting that aside, the story is the same at its core as the original novel and George Pal film. Its unique in science fiction in that it gives us a view of the distant future, not just a future a thousand or a couple hundred years from now, but nearly a million years ahead.And its a worthy contemplation on the outcome of science and technology. Ultimately, will it lead to our destruction or a return to any one of several forms of barbarism? HG Wells was alive at the dawn of the nuclear age, and as a writer he contemplated the idea of technology out of control... Even with good intentions, advances in science may ultimately lead to an unavoidable tragedy for us all.Personally I love this story because it takes you out of contemporary thinking. Nearly all science fiction deals with our current issues in a more near-term fantastical state. And this asks, what is the ultimate destiny of humaniy?Even considering the tragedy of what becomes of the race in this version of the story, the Earth is still young... There is time to recover from our mistakes. This is the open ended ending that offers hope. By the Time Traveler giving some of the Eloi back their freedom and a desire to fight for themselves, is he setting the world on course for a better future, or just a repeat of the past?We tend to think that society is more advanced today than it ever has been in the past, but do we really know this for sure? Everything decays. If you were to go back several million years in time (a short span in the geological age of the earth) would you find some advanced version of human society that ulitmately self-destructs - with all knowledge of their existence being lost to us now? Its possible this has happened multiple times in the history of the earth. The fossil record is very very scant.So HG Wells brings this philosophical point to the fore in his story, and its well worth contemplating. If for no other reason, it can take you out of your day to day problems for a time. Pretty much everything human beings concern themselves with are trivialities. If we were to be able to look back on our time from 800,000 years in the future, how much of what we concern ourselves with day to day would still look important?",4,Deviates from the original story but still well worth watching,1388880000,"01 5, 2014",2014,2621,"[""'ve"", 'watched', 'version', 'HG', 'Well', 'story', 'several', 'times', 'definitely', 'repeatable', 'view', 'major', 'change', 'made', 'film', 'giving', 'Time', 'Traveler', 'motivation', 'build', 'machine', 'losing', 'woman', 'paradox', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'go', 'back', 'save', 'due', 'fact', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'built', 'first', 'place', 'had', 'lived', 'married', 'him.Putting', 'aside', 'story', 'same', 'core', 'original', 'novel', 'George', 'Pal', 'film', 'unique', 'science', 'fiction', 'view', 'distant', 'future', 'not', 'just', 'future', 'thousand', 'couple', 'hundred', 'years', 'now', 'nearly', 'million', 'years', 'worthy', 'contemplation', 'outcome', 'science', 'technology', 'Ultimately', 'will', 'lead', 'destruction', 'return', 'one', 'several', 'forms', 'barbarism', 'HG', 'Wells', 'was', 'alive', 'dawn', 'nuclear', 'age', 'writer', 'contemplated', 'idea', 'technology', 'control', 'Even', 'good', 'intentions', 'advances', 'science', 'may', 'ultimately', 'lead', 'unavoidable', 'tragedy', 'all.Personally', 'love', 'story', 'contemporary', 'thinking', 'Nearly', 'science', 'fiction', 'deals', 'current', 'issues', 'more', 'near-term', 'fantastical', 'state', 'what', 'ultimate', 'destiny', 'humaniy', 'Even', 'considering', 'tragedy', 'what', 'race', 'version', 'story', 'Earth', 'still', 'young', 'time', 'recover', 'mistakes', 'open', 'ended', 'ending', 'hope', 'Time', 'Traveler', 'giving', 'Eloi', 'back', 'freedom', 'desire', 'fight', 'setting', 'world', 'course', 'better', 'future', 'just', 'repeat', 'past', 'tend', 'think', 'society', 'more', 'advanced', 'today', 'ever', 'been', 'past', 'do', 'really', 'know', 'sure', 'Everything', 'were', 'go', 'back', 'several', 'million', 'years', 'time', 'short', 'span', 'geological', 'age', 'earth', 'would', 'find', 'advanced', 'version', 'human', 'society', 'ulitmately', 'knowledge', 'existence', 'being', 'lost', 'now', 'possible', 'happened', 'multiple', 'times', 'history', 'earth', 'fossil', 'record', 'very', 'very', 'scant.So', 'HG', 'Wells', 'philosophical', 'point', 'fore', 'story', 'well', 'worth', 'contemplating', 'other', 'reason', 'can', 'take', 'day', 'day', 'problems', 'time', 'Pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'human', 'beings', 'concern', 'are', 'trivialities', 'were', 'be', 'able', 'look', 'back', 'time', '800,000', 'years', 'future', 'how', 'much', 'what', 'concern', 'day', 'day', 'would', 'still', 'look', 'important']",N/A

I, on the other hand, was totally pleased.It was as if I were seeing a SF film from the sixties made with today's technology. The machine itself was just as I imagined it when reading the book, the bamboo houses on the cliff side were great, and I liked the soundtrack.

It had, in fact, a number of good aspects.  It was great to look at, and the special effects added considerably to the story.  Guy Pearce was good in the lead role, and Samantha Mumba was remarkably fetching as Mara, the woman he would meet 800,000 years in the future.But there were just too many undeveloped or hard to swallow elements for this to be a good film, and it too often became merely unintelligible.  I have read Heidegger and Spinoza, Habermas and Derrida, Duns Scotus and Deleuze, so I can understand difficult texts and ideas when called to.  But there is a different between a merely difficult idea and an unintelligible one, and the central dilemma of this film--""Why can't I change the past?""--was dealt with in an unacceptably blithe and confused manner.  The ""answer"" as mouthed by Jeremy Irons, in a role that was more of a cameo than a real part, was unforgivably simplistic and superficial, not to say unconvincing.  But there were so many other moments that were so improbable that it was hard to take this movie seriously.  For instance, the Orlando Jones computer generated character appears not only in the early 21st century, but in the distant future as well, in the ruins of a former city.  What powered the computer that contained his database?  How did people hundreds of thousands of years in the future retain a perfect knowledge of the dead English language, and speak with a perfect accent?  How did our hero know that jamming the gears of his time machine would have the effect it would?  There were a host of other problems as well.If you don't ask questions of this film, and don't expect it to deliver much, it can provide a couple of hours of delicious eye candy.  But if you try to force it to make sense, you will hate it.  In the former, you end up not taking it seriously, which is on one level to do it and its makers a disservice.  On the latter, however, you do them the compliment of taking the film seriously, but at the cost of condemning it.

Just a few years later, I found a copy of the book and read it, enjoying it very much. First, lets get one thing out of the way. Neither movie version of ""The Time Machine"" has been absolutely faithful to the original novel written in 1895. Both departed from their literary source in ways which seemed appropriate for the times in which they were made. Having made that point, this, the 2002 version stands as a very good movie which can stand on its own merits, even if one has never read the novel.One feature I liked about this movie is that it does answer some questions which the book left unanswered (or even, unasked). The first of these is why the inventor is interested in time travel in the first place. It might be sufficient to give simple curiosity as a reason, but I believe the reason given in the film is more compelling. I do disagree with one point which the movie seems to imply, the premise that the past cannot be changed. Events happen the way they do not because of fate, but because people are either in the wrong place at the wrong time, or because they (or someone else) makes a decision one way instead of another. As one example, had the captain of the Titanic given orders to reduce speed at night, or adopted a slightly different course, the tragedy which befell his ship might well have been averted. In ""The Time Machine"", the inventor is driven to build the machine because he wants to change an event in his own recent past. He is then driven to journey into the distant future in hopes of discovering why he cannot change the past.This version does give affectionate nods both to the book and the 1960 version of the film. Writing in 1895, Wells describes the machine as having quartz rods, one of which was improperly made, and had to be made again. In this film version, we actually see numerous crystalline rods arranged in two rotating sections so as to form parts of a sphere. When energized, they create a field which forms a complete, spherical bubble around the machine, effectively ""insulating"" it from the time stream. The interesting thing here is that quartz crystals form the timekeeping element in the majority of watches and clocks sold today, although they were not invented until the 1960's. Was this just a lucky guess on H.G. Wells part?One of the actors from the 1960 version has a cameo role in this film, and one sequence, in which the machine is moving forward through time while the inventor watches fashions change in a dress shop across the street has been retained.Another question which the book does not answer is ""Why did the time traveller never return after his last voyage"" (he did make a brief return to have dinner with his friends, and tell them of his adventures). It is left up to the reader to imagine what could have happened. In this film, we are shown what happens, and it is a satisfactory resolution, given his reason for building the machine.Some of the themes of the book are explored a bit more deeply, such as the social rift between the laborers and the social elite, which was apparant even in Wells day. The film shows the result of these social classes actually becoming separate species through millenia of enforced separation.The movie does have some flaws, which have been noted by other reviewers. It is difficult to imagine any artifacts from the 20th century lasting 800,000 years, yet they have a few in the far distant future. I can imagine a piece of stainless steel, such as a knife lasting that long, but not easily can I see a computer so durable, yet there is one in the film. In spite of this, I did like the character played by Orlando Jones, the ""ghost"" in the computer, someone not in the book, nor anything Wells would have likely even thought of, yet an interesting and worthwhile addition.Admittedly, the Moon breaking up in the 21st century as a result of nuclear explosions is also inconsistent with what we know of impact crater physics, which are MUCH more powerful than current nuclear weapons.I do take exception with the ""goofs"" list on this films description, in which it is claimed that the bicycle-type wheels on the steam carriage are not correct for the time (1895-1900). The fact is, much of early automobile technology was borrowed directly from the bicycle industry, and the earliest Stanley, Locomobile, White and other steam cars, as well as the earliest Fords, Oldsmobiles, Haynes, (gasoline cars) ALL had bicycle type wheels, only adopting wooden wheels later. The car in the film appears to be a Locomobile (or a replica), and is correctly shown with bicycle type wheels. However, the soundtrack does have the wrong engine sound dubbed in, a sputtering gasoline engine noise audible as it is driven away. Rudyard Kipling owned a Locomobile, and described it as ""noiseless"". The hissing steam sounds and visible steam clouds do seem correct.However, these are small points to pick on. Taken as a whole, the film is enjoyable and exciting. I thought all the actors gave fine performances, and most of the special effects were excellent. I'm pleased to have added this to my permanent collection.",4,An enjoyable scientific romance,1133568000,"12 3, 2005",2005,5253,"['saw', '1960', 'film', 'version', 'Time', 'Machine', '1968', 'when',

588387,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00005JKLZ,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[4, 5]","If you've seen the 1960's version of the ""Time Machine"" or even braved Welles's book (or caught ""Time After Time in 1979) there's really not a lot that will surprise you.  That's a shame, because there's actually a lot here to enjoy, but spoiled by a script that seems to content to stick to the basics of a story that most science-fiction fans already know (at least subconsciously) and plump the rest with action.In the new version, the ""Time Traveler"" is a ""Turn of the Century"" New York inventor named Hartdegen (Guy Pierce), an earnest scientist who tragically loses his fianc&eacute;e during a robbery in Central Park.  Unlike intellectuals find solace in learning from the past and re-shaping the future, Hartdegen (who trades letters with some way-out Swiss patent clerk named Einstein) is determined to reshape the past and keep his future nice and neat.  Throwing himself into his work, Hartdegen conceives a time machine.  (That's right - though a product of Victorian times, Hartdegen is a very contemporary hero, for him it's personal.) Revisiting the scene of tragedy, Hartdegen saves the day - only to see his fianc&eacute;e die anyway.  No matter how often Hartdegen changes the history, fates snaps back.  Frustrated, Hartdegen jumps ahead in time, hoping that a future civilization (which of course must be an advanced and civilized society) will discover how you can change history.  Mankind of the future, Hartdegen unfortunately learns, is less concerned with changing the future or the past as it is with turning the moon into a huge condo. For serious questions, the future turns to a chatty holographic computer named Vox (Orlando Jones).  Vox can't really solve Hartdegen's problems, but that's not really the point.  We're smart enough to know that Hartdegen will never find an answer - a race against time is always a losing proposition.Jumping farther into the future when a global cataclysm nearly wipes out humanity, Hartdegen finds himself in the deceptive tranquility described in the original book - one in which the human race is split in half between gentle Eloi who do and think nothing, and the vicious Morlocks who create and consume everything.  Hartdegen has barely enough time to fall in love and consider abandoning his search when he learns of the Morlocks, and decides that he must save the Eloi.  The story introduces one new novelty - a thinking ""uber"" Morlock played by Jeremy Irons (an inspired bit of casting - he has psychic powers and can throw you around by the throat, but it's his verbal delivery that's deadliest), and even finds a way to keep Vox around in an age in which his creators aren't even a memory.  The story is actually full of cool details, but spends no time on them before tossing Hartdegen into a fight or onto his machine or gets some other CGI action going.  The story takes a novel approach to explaining what wiped out ""civilization"" (it was supposed to be war - class war in Welles's book, and nuclear war in the first movie; here it's a horrible miscalculation we can probably blame on some mega-corporation), but wastes little time between setting humanity up for a fall and dropping the bomb.  Vox is annoying, and even verges into being inhuman (he seems a bit too fascinated by the vicious order of the Morlocks and Eloi) but that's the point - he's not supposed to be human, and he's supposed to be more amused than repelled by cruelty because of how much cruelty comprises his card catalog.  Unfortunately, the film humanizes him, as if it knows no middle-ground between naughty and nice.  The film gets some good mileage out of Hartdegen's personal search for a way to change the past, and surprisingly sets up the uber morlock with the climactic job of convincing him that he's stuck with the cards dealt by fate.  Unfortunately, by then, Hartdegen has at least probably put that problem on the back burner, and it hasn't exactly obsessed us either.  The uber Morlock becomes a mechanism for discovering Hartdegen's demon's, not by analyzing his machine, but simply reading his mind.  It's not clear how his mental powers really can deal with Hartdegen's problems - but it's soon clear that the script has the same problem - the confrontation turns into a fight.  In the end, this ed. of ""The Time Machine"" uses CGI effects to trail off where its smarter ideas should have been, leaving you little more than a slightly more inventive version of the original.

Wells novel that this movie is based on, though I have seen the original movie from the early 60's (yeah, I know, what kind of sci-fi nerd am I?) However, I know enough about it to know that this movie is NOT like the book. Some of the changes were good, some were not.The movie begins with the death of the professor's fiancee, which I thought was a nice addition; it created empathy for the guy (no pun intended,) and also a motivation for building the time machine and putting himself in possible danger by using an experimental invention. I liked Guy Pearce's portrayal; a moody, eccentric, almost Dr. Who-like protagonist was refreshing for someone who doesn't swoon for fearless, wisecracking badasses.On the downside, the logical flaws are many: the often-mentioned fact that the English language as it is spoken today managed to survive an apocalypse and 800 *thousand* years of evolution. Oh, yeah and the only one who can speak said 'old language' fluently just happens to be a young, gorgeous unattached woman. And there's this supercomputer and its flat-screen glass panes that managed to survive 800,000 years of geological movement and erosion.The main thing I found troubling was the fact that the socio-economic angle that made the book and original movie such a disturbing vision of the future was downplayed to the point of non-existence. There's no mention of the upper and working classes evolving into the Eloi and Morlocks, so the second half of the movie has more of a ""good guys vs. the monsters"" feel than a reversal of social classes. The Eloi are supposed to be as tragic and disturbing as the Morlocks are.Despite the plotholes and watering down of the original lesson, it was a fairly good movie that I don't mind seeing again.

The plot is very thin, allowing the filmmaker to add all kinds of details and characters. But the visual potential is great, something a good director can really sink his teeth into. Unfortunately, Simon Wells blew it. He added  characters and plot details, but none of them are compelling. The main character, played by Guy Pearce, is a romantic. He finds the love of his life and loses her, more than once (and more than one woman as well). This romance feels all wrong, like the love story tacked on to so many recent special-effect-heavy films (Gangs of New York, Attack of the Clones, etc.).The visual aspect is good in small parts, but most of the movie looks silly or boring. The urban landscapes (New York in the future and London in the past) are beautifully-built. The laboratory and the time machine itself look good, too. But soon enough, the story moves to a rainforest that looks exactly as you would imagine it. There are no surprises and no creativity. The Morlocks have very little thought put into them, as well. They look like dust-covered Uruk-hai.You know the story is too complex when you need *two* extraneous characters to explain everything (Orlando Jones and Jeremy Irons).

Guy Pearce takes over the reins from Rod Taylor, and like his predecessor, maintains a stalwart sense of decency as a Victorian inventor out of time.  The twist here is that the time traveler seeks not the utopian future presumed in the novel--and therefore unfortunately avoids many of the philosophical discussions about the nature of humankind in the former film--but to overturn a personal tragedy.  The result is a Saturday-matinee-style adventure that is both colorful and high-spirited, to the degree that much of the cynicism of Wells' original concept goes unnoticed.  (Many viewers will probably overlook the irony that it is the ""civilized"" time traveler who introduces genocide to the post-apocalyptic future).

588401,A1BJREK8Z79SAP,B00005JKLZ,"Sung-chao Cheng ""Sung-Chao Cheng""","[1, 3]","Of all the sci-fi movies I've seen, there remain three that are of my favorites or should I say most favorites:  1. The Time Machine, 2. Contact, and 3. Aliens 2.  I can't say which one is the best, neither can I arrange them in order of excellence. They are all very good, each in its own way.  I'll review them all,separately.This movie is very exciting to watch and it has a very sad episode in it to break your heart.  Guy Pearce is Professor Alexander Hartdegen, he is also an extraordinary inventor, the Time Machine that is.  The machine was invented for the purpose of adventure, I think, but in the end he tried to use it to undone a personal tragedy.  I'll refrain from saying what kind of personal tragedy.  To his dismay and disappointment, he found out that he couldn't change history; I don't know about you but it broke my heart to watch him go through it.  He then, went farther into the future and at the second stop he was at the time of a worldwide calamity, the moon cracked, I don't remember what was the cause.  New York was in a chaotic situation, the soldiers tried to force the professor to a safe place but he broke away and ran into his machine and banged his head and accidentally pressed on the time button and passed out.  The machine kept running rapidly into the future until about eight hundred thousand years later.  During this long period of time, the surface of the earth has changed drastically due to climatic violence, I guess.  When he came back to his senses he found out that the world was still very beautiful,even the severed moon looked strangely beautiful, but only on the surface.  He found out soon enough that the nice, friendly people, especially the girl who came upon him and saved him and nursed him have been helplessly preyed on by some evil force.You'll have to pardon me for having to refrain from telling you what kind of evil force.  Some type of movies or many movies, it is better that some important parts of the plots are better left for you to find out for yourselves.I feel the insignificance of the human race watching this movie.  It is really how I always feel about life or being a human being anyway.  Men cannot control fate, the environment, or even their own emotions at times.  despite some cocky or conceited characters always claim that we hold fate in our hands, do what we want with it.  Well, wait till you board on a plane that is going to crash, or hit by a car crossing the street, even when walking on the footpath.Let me come back from the detour, Guy Pearce is excellent as the noble and gallant great inventor. I am not sure you can find someone with all these supreme qualities rolled into one person in real life, on top of that professor Alexander Hartdegen is quite handsome and sexy, with a physique too, how can I not admire him.  Of course the world of 800,000 years from now is a completely new and exciting story.  Jeremy Iron is also very good as a creature that has evolved into a species other than human, with a back somewhat like a fish but not quite, and he has super natural power that can infiltrate the mind of people, and make them dream what he dictates.  He can also read mind so that he knows all about the professor's past.  Nevertheless, good prevailed over evil at the end.  The professor defeated the evil creature and saved the helpless people.  He used the time machine to destroy the evil force completely.  In spite of that everything had to be started from the beginning because the people were illiterate, I gather.  Never fear, the people have the professor, he'll be able to build everything from scratch.I love a happy ending.Best line in the picture:  ""It's only a machine"", the reply from the professor when the girl of his future mate said, ""Sorry about the machine"".

It's from the Time Machine book after all.Unfortunately, when you go to see it, something's just not right.  For the first 30 minutes or so the film seems good, and then it just loses its magic.  I guess in the film the future doesn't seem so future-esque.  It doesn't paint a picture of being FAR out into the future like the book does.  It almost feels like one of the actors could just walk off the set at any moment, and if the camera follows him you'll see New York City in the background.At this point the film seems mediocre, but unfortunately it doesn't stay that way.  When it gets to the end, the hero meets this really cool evil guy in a dark cavern.  They get all philosophical and stuff, and it's neat for a while.  And then all of a sudden the film starts to fall apart completely.  At this point, the presence of the evil guy shows the film has already deviated from the book, so who knows what will happen.

588414,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B00005JKLZ,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[25, 35]","If one must start with the good in a show, this was cute. The acting was fine, and the music well done. As to the rest, well, in context, I'm one of the few of the species who prefers the original ""Star Trek,"" which I saw in black and white in those days, and even the original ""Outer Limits,"" which was produced in black and white, despite the superior special effects and even scripts of the later models.Oh, and those effects. This version of The Time Machine seemed to have been produced for the effects. Interestingly, most of them I'd seen in other films, from the original ""Invaders from Mars,"" to at least one Star Trek film, to ""The Relic,"" to ""Contact."" Well, giving the devil his or her due, perhaps there is only so much one can do with special effects.But the plot! With his original novella, Mr. Wells intended to predict the down-side of the industrial revolution and what developed as global capitalism: the evolution of two separate human species. The Eloi, meek, weak and prey, were what was to happen to the aristocrats. Members of the working class were to become the Morlocks, a bigger, brutal predator living beneath the surface and condemned to darkness. The original, 1960 film depoliticized the novel to a degree but repoliticized it in the context of the nuclear holocaust fearing 1960 world. This one not only depoliticized it but made it into a romance novel; the lead becomes obsessed with production of a time machine after his fianc&eacute; is murdered. Quaint, but H.G.'s whole point was missed (if I may risk the passive voice.)And why did they make the lead characters American and in New York? Guy Pearce is from down under and the guy who played his closest friend, Philby, I'd only seen before in ""The Full Monty."" He's English! But they cast those men into roles of Americans in New York in a film that was written late in the 19th century by an Englishman. That was bad judgment in either casting or screenwriting. Alan Young, before his outstanding role as Mr. Ed's straight man, played Philby in the original. He, frankly, was a more convincing Englishman than Rod Taylor. He has a cameo in here, presumably to pull in fans of the original.The Jeremy Irons character added almost a third human species, a sort of pharaoh of the brutal Morlocks. That added still another dimension so much as to destroy HG's objectives. For shame.There were portions I liked. The holographic library resource, for instance, referred to the George Pal production (the 1960 film) before describing the eccentric late 19th century Alexander, to whom the hologram is speaking. Cute. And the teacher threatening to resequence an unruly student's DNA, or something to that effect, reminded me of the futuristic movies of the 1950s. A great effect. Other additions, e.g., the moon's annihilation because of mining or something going on there, that was done, I suppose, for dramatic effect. But that would be more appropriate to another story, maybe by the same people who wrote ""Robocop,"" not this one.The effects of the Pal production were good for the time. The Morlocks were more like professional wrestlers with blue make-up but they were convincing for a youthful, 1960 audience. In this production the special effects were better done but at what cost?It's not a bad movie, really, if you're into thrillers. But if you want any of the spirit of the novella, this isn't the one to see.I'm new to DVDs and this is the first film I saw that had those DVD add-ons, e.g., a deleted scene. I don't know why people are so excited about that extra stuff. It doesn't make a bad movie better, or a good one worse. Perhaps I'll grow to like those bells and whistles, For now, give me the 1960 production any day over this one, especially in terms of being true to the fine H.G.

588415,A4JHEO7H330AF,B00005JKLZ,Tom Brody,"[4, 6]","THE TIME MACHINE is a science fiction romance featuring Guy Pearce as the college professor and Samantha Mumba as the love interest.  Ms.Mumba lives in the distant future, and resides in a primitive vertical village built into the steep sides of a canyon.  The movie features plenty of gee-whiz gizmos.  These gizmos will be the delight, especially to children between the ages of eight to fourteen.  The opening sequence of the movie takes place in a college and in the professor's laboratory, and the viewer is treated to plenty of gizmos, including an early version of the electric toothbrush.  Then, we see the time machine, with its brass fittings and whirling crystalline components.  And then, in the distant future, the viewer is treated to a melange of shelters, ladders, windmills, and other devices, all of wood and natural fibers, which belong to the primitive civilization of the Eloi people.In my opinion, the first third of the film is the best part.  Mr.Pearce is courting actress Sienna Guillory, in the spare moments that somehow seem to be left free from his busy schedule of teaching and research.  The turn-of-the-century society, as shown in the first third of the film, is one of turn-of-the-century prudishness.  In one scene, Ms.Guillory is shocked (but happily so) when Mr.Pearce kisses her in public.  While at an evening ice skating date, Mr. Pearce presents Ms.Guillory with an engagement ring.  Ms.Guillory is not only beautiful, but her lips and cheeks quivver in a fascinating and fetching manner, in response to Mr.Pearce's interest in marriage.  Any viewer of this display of little twitches and quivverings of pleasure, will be convinced that such is the stuff of movie actors (and not within the achievable realm of any ordinary amateur actor).At any rate, the viewer's exposure to Ms.Gullory is cut short by a street thug, who slays her by the ice skating pond.  Mr.Pearce responds with an expressions of shock and agony.  Again, such expressions are within the capabilities of an rare and occasional trained actor, and not within the realm of amateur actors.  In response, Mr.Pearce devotes himself to building a time machine, with the goal of traveling back to the past to change what happened.  He succeeds, in part, because he is able to meet Ms.Guillory shortly before her demise, and he succeeds further, by convincing her to travel away from the ice skating pond.  But alas, she is run over in an accident with a horse-drawn carriage.The film shifts gears, and Mr.Pearce decides to travel forwards in time for an answer, where his goal is still to save Ms.Guillory.  What thus occurs is, at least in my opinion, one of the finest sequences in film history.  The earlier film from 1960 contains an equivalent sequence, but it is clumsy and clunky compared to this sequence in the Guy Pearce movie.  At any rate, the viewer is treated to a particular, static location (Mr. Pearce's laboratory) but where time races forwards by many years.  We see a view of the women's shop across the street from the laboratory, where the style of the fashions displayed in the front window is updated every few seconds, where the hemlines rise ever higher.  We see a bird's eye view of the laboratory, where small structures are replaced by skyscrapers.  Eventually, Mr.Pearce halts his time travel, and finds himself in a modern society where the mining taking place on the moon resulted in an accident where the moon got partially shattered, and is missing a few chunks.This moon scene is one of the cleverest in the history of cinema, in my opinion.  An engaging part of this movie, is when Mr.Pearce meets an ordinary young woman with her bicycle.  The woman glances at the time machine, parked in an alleyway, and she makes the comment that it looks like a cappuccino machine.  (I like cappuccinos and, to my knowledge, this is one of the few existing jokes about cappuccinos. To digress a bit, it might be noted that Gary Larson has a cartoon about lattes, where a cowboy says, ""Latte, Jed?"")  Then, Mr.Pearce leaves the bicycle woman, and continues traveling in time.  The viewer is treated to scenes where thousands of years are compressed into a minute, and we see erosion and canyons being formed with the passage of time.  Mr.Pearce eventually halts in the far, distant future (the year 802,701 A.D.), where he makes an acquaintance with the Eloi people and the lovely Samantha Mumba.  There are many engaging and charming episodes in this part of the movie, when Mr.Pearce gets to know the Eloi people, and where he wins their trust.Much of the rest of the movie concerns the Morlocks and their evil leader, Jeremy Irons.  While I did not particularly care for the part of the movie featuring the Morlocks, nothing can be done about this, since they are an integral part of the original TIME MACHINE novel.  At any rate, the Morlocks are scary and they jump around like grasshoppers and they chase people, and eventually they eat people (but this eating is not shown).  Then, Mr.Pearce hikes down into cave and eventually confronts Mr.Irons.  To me, this part of the movie was really stupid.  First of all, Mr.Irons just looks like himself but with tons of white makeup.  Aside from the gobs of white makeup, there was no attempt to change his morphology from that of a regular human being.  To conclude, I enjoy watching the first hour of the movie, periodically, perhaps once a year.  The first hour of the movie is a clever, heart-tugging, science fiction romance.",5,"An engaging, heart-tugging, science fiction romance.",1312588800,"08 6, 2011",2011,5506,"['TIME', 'MACHINE',

Simon Wells guides his camera with an artisic hand, gently leading us from epoch in time, to the next, with beauty, and panache.  Then there is newcomer Samantha Momba, who gives a moving performance as the time traveller's Eloi love interest, Mora.I liked the remake.  I didn't love the remake.  When I saw it at the theatre, I caught myself dozing, somewhere between the apocalyptic Moon sequence, and Hartdegen's introduction to the Morlocks.  The acting by many of the performers is extremely flat.  The friendship between the time traveller, and David Filby--a marvellous corner stone of the original George Pal film, is greatly diminished here.  The slam bang visuals overwhelm the characters, I think.  Part of the problem is the score.  Many people hold Klaus Badelt's musical landscape in very high regard.  And hearing it alone, on CD, I can understand why.  However, when the soundtrack is heard, in tandem with the images in the film, it becomes extremely ponderous, and slow moving.I purchased the remake because of my fondness for the Wells novel, and for the 1961 film version.

588418,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00005JKLZ,trebe,"[1, 1]","Herbert George Wells (H.G. Wells) along with Jules Verne was one of the pioneers in the genre that would become science fiction.  The Time Machine, The Invisible Man, and The War Of The Worlds, are among Wells' most famous stories.  Produced by George Pal, the film version ofThe War of the Worlds (Special Collector's Edition)(1953) starring Gene Barry, became a science fiction classic, and won an Academy Award for special effects.  Pal produced and directed the 1960 version ofThe Time Machine, featuring Rod Taylor, which also became a sci-fi classic, and likewise won an Oscar for best special effects.This update of The Time Machine (2002) was directed by Simon Wells, the great-grandson of H. G. Wells.  While featuring some of the key elements from the 1960 film, including the iconic sled-like time machine, and a trip into the future where the Eloi and Morlocks inhabit the earth, the similarities are mostly superficial, as the story undergoes a mass reworking that emphasizes adventure, romance, and special effects.Guy Pearce (The Proposition) is Alexander Hartdegen, a mechanical engineer interested in theories involving time travel.  When his fianc&eacute;e Emma (Sienna Guillory) is tragically killed, Hartdegen devotes his life to developing a time machine to go back into the past, change what occurred, and save Emma's life.  Amazingly, Hartdegen successfully travels back in time, but his spirit is crushed when despite his efforts, Emma perishes again, only in a different manner.Still seeking a way to successfully change the past, Alexander travels into the future, and after several stops, he winds up in the year 802,701.  There he is taken in by people known as the Eloi, who live in an area that was once New York City.  Hartdegen is under the care of Mara (Samantha Mumba) and her brother Kalen (Omero Mumba).  When the Eloi are surprise attacked by the Morlocks, creatures who live underground, Mara is captured and dragged below the sands.  There in a strange subterranean kingdom ruled by the Uber-Morlock (Jeremy Irons), Hartdegen has a strange and dramatic confrontation that settles his fate.This remake of The Time Machine is a slick, big budget science fantasy adventure with ample special effects that although driven by romance, somehow doesn't have much of a heart, and is largely founded on pretentious nonsense.  Apparently all the events in the future, depend on Emma's death spurring Hartdegen's efforts at time travel.  Even if you buy that premise, with a future so bleak, it's hard to conceive that there are no better options.  Still, if man is even around in the year 802,701 perhaps any kind of existence might be welcome.  Alexander Hartdegen is inconsistent, written as something of a dandy who never gets his clothes dirty, who occasionally gets courageous.  The whole freaky Uber Morlock storyline complete with Jeremy Irons in whiteface and Hartdegen's watch collection, with the muddled mess of an ending, than features the apparent annihilation of  an entire race, is just silly.  Not to mention the holographic librarian played by Orlando Jones (MadTV), who somehow still has a source of power 800,000 years later.  The special effects are at times impressive, but not very believable.  The same also goes for the rubbery suited Morlocks.This version of The Time Machine is mildly entertaining, but is not particularly memorable, and not an effort that many would regard as being close to the same class as the original.",2,an odd update of a science fiction classic...,1297468800,"02 12, 2011",2011,3479,"['Herbert', 'George', 'Wells', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'Jules', 'Verne', 'was', 'one', 'pioneers', 'genre', 'would', 'become', 'science', 'fiction', 'Time', 'Machine', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'War', 'Worlds', 'are', 'Wells', 'most', 'famous', 'stories', 'Produced', 'George', 'Pal', 'film', 'version', 'War', 'Worlds', 'Special', 'Collector', 'Edition', '1953', 'starring', 'Gene', 'Barry', 'became', 'science', 'fiction', 'classic', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'special', 'effects', 'Pal', 'produced', 'directed', '1960', 'version', 'ofThe', 'Time', 'Machine', 'featuring', 'Rod', 'Taylor', 'also', 'became', 'sci-fi', 'classic', 'likewise', 'won', 'Oscar', 'best', 'special', 'effects.This', 'update', 'Time', 'Machine', '2002', 'was', 'directed', 'Simon', 'Wells', 'great-grandson', 'H.', 'G.', 'Wells', 'featuring', 'key', 'elements', '1960', 'film', 'including', 'iconic', 'sled-like', 'time', 'machine', 'trip', 'future', 'where', 'Eloi', 'Morlocks', 'inhabit', 'earth', 'similarities', 'are', 'mostly', 'superficial', 'story', 'mass', 'reworking', 'adventure', 'romance', 'special', 'effects.Guy', 'Pearce', 'Proposition', 'Alexander', 'Hartdegen', 'mechanical', 'engineer', 'interested', 'theories', 'involving', 'time', 'travel', 'When', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Emma', 'Sienna', 'Guillory', 'tragically', 'killed', 'Hartdegen', 'life', 'developing', 'time', 'machine', 'go', 'back', 'past', 'change', 'what', 'occurred', 'save', 'Emma', 'life', 'Amazingly', 'Hartdegen', 'successfully', 'back', 'time', 'spirit', 'crushed', 'when', 'efforts', 'Emma', 'again', 'only', 'different', 'manner.Still', 'seeking', 'way', 'successfully', 'change', 'past', 'Alexander', 'future', 'several', 'stops', 'up', 'year', '802,701', 'taken', 'people', 'known', 'Eloi', 'who', 'live', 'area', 'was', 'once', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Hartdegen', 'care', 'Mara', 'Samantha', 'Mumba', 'brother', 'Kalen', 'Omero', 'Mumba', 'When', 'Eloi', 'are', 'surprise', 'attacked', 'Morlocks', 'creatures', 'who', 'live', 'underground', 'Mara', 'captured', 'dragged', 'sands', 'strange', 'subterranean', 'kingdom', 'ruled', 'Uber-Morlock', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Hartdegen', 'strange', 'dramatic', 'confrontation', 'fate.This', 'remake', 'Time', 'Machine', 'slick', 'big', 'budget', 'science', 'fantasy', 'adventure', 'ample', 'special', 'effects', 'driven', 'romance', 'somehow', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'heart', 'largely', 'founded', 'pretentious', 'nonsense', 'Apparently', 'events', 'future', 'depend', 'Emma', 'death', 'spurring', 'Hartdegen', 'efforts', 'time', 'travel', 'Even', 'buy', 'premise', 'future', 'so', 'bleak', 'hard', 'conceive', 'are', 'better', 'options', 'Still', 'man', 'even', 'around', 'year', '802,701', 'perhaps', 'kind', 'existence', 'might', 'be', 'welcome', 'Alexander', 'Hartdegen', 'inconsistent', 'written', 'something', 'dandy', 'who', 'never', 'clothes', 'dirty', 'who', 'occasionally', 'courageous', 'whole', 'freaky', 'Uber', 'Morlock', 'storyline', 'complete', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'whiteface', 'Hartdegen', 'watch', 'collection', 'muddled', 'mess', 'ending', 'apparent', 'annihilation', 'entire', 'race', 'just', 'silly', 'Not', 'mention', 'holographic', 'librarian', 'played', 'Orlando', 'Jones', 'MadTV', 'who', 'somehow', 'still', 'source', 'power', '800,000', 'years', 'later', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'times', 'impressive', 'not', 'very', 'believable', 'same', 'also', 'rubbery', 'suited', 'Morlocks.This', 'version', 'Time', 'Machine', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'not', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'not', 'effort', 'many', 'would', 'regard', 'being', 'close', 'same', 'class', 'original']",N/A

588420,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JKLZ,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 2]","As you know, this version is from the first under our suspicious eyes -- remake of George Pal classic?  (I can hear some of you say ""No more remakes!"")  Or, who's the director Simon Wells -- H.G. Well's great-grandson?  (So what?)  Well, this is not exactly a remake of that 1960 version, and Mr. Simon has actually directed films in the past (see ""Balto""), so he is no newcomer who doesn't know anything about moviemaking.  And  before you criticize this entertaining version of ""Time Machine,"" you should remember one thing, and this is it.Many complaints are based on our preoccupied idea about Time Machine and its concept.  You expect some genuine Sci-Fi story like Tom Cruise's ""Minority Report.""  Wrong.  ""Time Machine"" of 2002 sticks fairly closely to the original novella written by H. G. Wells, and if you have read that, the filmmaker's intention is clearer.  There's a lot of cool gadgets (especially the time machine design and its time travel seqences), but the original story had another agenda which the film tries to preserve, and I will explain later below.The story of the film, to be honest, is pretty weak.  It follows a scientst living in New York, 1899 (Guy Pearce), who is to invent a time machine to change the past.  For he is to lose his finacee, so he decides to go back before she is dead, and tries to change her fate.  But he fails, and despair makes him time-travel further, this time to the future, to find the reason.  He goes on and on, finally arrives at the future 800,000 years later from his original time.So far, all right, though somewhat the story is far-fetched.  But now the trouble follows unless you're prepared for the drastic turn of the story.  For many audience will witness the future looks like ... the past!  Actually, humans are living in coarsely made houses, wearing ""Flintstone""-like clothes.  Night is pitch dark, no books, no TVs, nothing.  In fact, I heard one of the audience sitting in the theater say, ""It's like an episode from ""Indiana Jones,"" as if being perplexed, or cheated.This is what happens if you expect here another P. K. Dick world.  You might feel like being served a wrong dish you didn't order in a restaurant.  But the original book goes exactly like this as this film shows, and Time Traveller is to see wicked Morlocks killing meek Eois, and that bleak world is usually thought to be H. G. Well's satire of the comtemporary English class system.  The film justly observes that point, but whether it is exactly what the audience of the 21st century wanted is another matter.  Considering the number of negative reviews, they didn't.So, keep these things in mind, and aceept the film as it is, discarding your own images about time machines.  The CGI techniques are all first-rate, serving as joyful eye-candy, and special make-ups of Morlocks are astonishing, courtesy of Stan Winston Studio.  Pearce is reliable, which we all know (and I know because I saw ""Memento""), and an unexpected find is Irish singer Samantha Mumba as Mara (her brother Kalen is played by Samantha's real brother Omero, who is also good).  It's a bit pity that Mark Addy and Phyllida Law (Emma Thompson and Sophie Thompson's mother) are given small roles, and as to Jeremy Irons, ... er ... officially I announce, he is now a character actor, playing evil mastermind Uber-Morlock.Not a perfect film, I admit, but ""Time Machine"" might become a better film if you just change the way you look at it.

588421,A2Y55P7L3NFZ2F,B00005JKLZ,"T. Thompson ""Clydesight Productions""","[0, 0]","Okay, I am a BIG fan of the 1960's George Pal ""Time Machine"". I saw it as a kid and many times since. That is a GREAT film. So I was concerned about this new remake. Yet, I found myself warming up to it for ten reasons.1. It has a wonderful musical score. This is a highlight of the film and reason enough to see it.2. The Time Machine itself is very close to what Wells described, with some modern thinking applied. Thus, it forms a force field time bubble around itself when in operation. In the 1960's force fields - what were those? So this new addition makes sense. Regardless of your tastes (I love the 1960's time machine design too) this machine has plenty of brass and polish and spinning glass (quartz?) bits to make you think it actually is doing something! It's a great design.3. This version has a believable and moving back story. I don't want to give away spoilers, but I will say that the time traveler, (named Alexander Hartigan instead of plain old George as in the 1960's film) has a very personal and tragic reason to invent a time machine. In the original, the motivation was scientific curiosity and hopes of learning from the future (which would create a paradox). In this one, the motivation is to learn from the future to solve a personal problem. It is believable, although it does push the edge. The original had the typical adventurer hero of the time, this version has a tragic hero more suited to our time. Guy Pierce does a great job, although his performance has been severely criticized because of his appearance. His role is that of a geek who cannot understand tragedy and is desperately trying to solve a problem against impossible odds. The original character was more of an adventurer. Admittedly, this film has some logical problems with time paradoxes that they never resolve.4. Samantha Mumba does a wonderful job as Marla, the Eloi. Weena, of the original, naive with childlike innocence is gone. But it makes more sense to HOW the Eloi and Morlocks came to be in this version. They have made some serious changes here. In the 1960's version, and the book, the Eloi are cattle (sheep) for the Morlocks who feed them and then feed ON them. In this version, they are humans who are self sustaining but are being held BACK from development by the Morlocks through mind control. And they are still the main course. Mind control is a serious concern in today's world. It wasn't so much in the 1960's or during Wells time. So this update makes sense, given the social situation and the concerns of the audience. This also explains more of what happens at the end of the film, which I don't want to give away.5. Jeremy Irons (the Morlock leader) does a fine job, although he is a bit difficult to understand. You have to watch him carefully to realize that he is the ""master"" of both the Morlocks and the Eloi. Yet, he is a loss. He can never be more than just a master manipulator, heartless, soulless, and pale by comparison (literally) to the time traveler. He never appears in the book or the 1960's film, but his addition here does help explain what is going on, and gives Alexander additional motivation for what happens at the end of the film. It also answers the nagging question of the book and the 1960's film. If the Morlocks are little more than beasts and monsters, how do they manage the Eloi, and how do they build and manage their underground empire? The Jeremy Irons character helps resolve these issues.6. The sets are really cleverly designed and are futuristic, yet primitive in the far future, and in the 19th century scenes, they are lush and full.7. There is some humor in the movie (missing entirely in the 1960's version and the book) which is a nice touch. Mrs. Watchit (get the name: Watch It?) is charming and a good foil to Hartigan's bumbling-professor absent mindedness.8. Orland Jones does a great job as an artificial intelligence hologram persona. This is the farthest reach from the novel and the 1960's film. His character has no reason to exist except to show us where we, as a technological society, are trying to go. Yes, the part could have been eliminated, but it is very entertaining. It is a bit of an update of the ""talking rings"" of the 1960's version that explains what happened to society. But in this case, well... you have to see the film to discover how this character becomes very important.9. In the book and the 1960's movie, the tragic alteration of human civilization is a result of war. War was a big problem in Wells' time, and in the 1960's we were in midst of the cold war and fear of nuclear disaster. But today's concerns are different, we deal with other disasters, terrorism, and the destruction of the environment (and thus society) through human error (think of all the oil spills, climate change, pollution, etc.) So the event that happens in this movie to cause the rise of the Morlocks and the Eloi has been updated for our modern concerns.10. The movie is fun to watch, and has very good special effects, including some great time-lapse photography- as did the 1960's masterpiece.Conclusion:I recommend this movie as an added 'must-see' for fans of Time Machines. By all means, read the novel to get an idea of what Wells was about. See the 1960's George Pal version and enjoy it for all its splendor.Then watch this one for the fun, and reasons I mentioned. If you do that, you'll have a rich 'library' of experience with Time Machines that might keep you thinking for a while. Enjoy it.",5,A Fine Remake - With Excellent Special Effects and a Fantastic Musical Score,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,5492,"['Okay', 'am', 'BIG', 'fan', '1960', 'George', 'Pal', 'Time', 'Machine',

588422,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00005JKLZ,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[1, 1]","THE TIME MACHINE by H.G. Wells really doesn't make that great of a movie if one stays true to the text. After all, H.G. Wells' book was more a commentary on society than a science fiction novel. With that said, THE TIME MACHINE movie directed by Simon Wells is a rocking adventure, full of excitement.The movie stars Guy Pierce (L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, MEMENTO) as Alexander Hartdegen. Hartdegen is a professor at Columbia University and among several eccentricies contains a correspondence with German clerk, Albert Einstein. Hartdegen has an interest in all things mechanical and a strange fascination with time. However, it takes an overwhelming tragedy to focus Hartdegen's energies into building a time machine. He travels into the past and future, but a knock on the head causes him to travel 800,000 years farther into the future than he planned. There he discovers two races of men: the peaceful Eloi and the cannabilistic Morlocks. Alex is faced with a choice and his decision will affect all of time.Simon Wells has done a good job of putting together an action packed science fiction adventure. It is true that the movie does not much resemble his great-grandfather's novel. However, Simon Wells did not write the script. He just had an opportunity to work on something and have a family connection.Anyway, the movie is fairly fast paced and though it does not try to explain time travel (such as the great BACK TO THE FUTURE) and has a few plot holes, the movie is still enjoyable. It's not as good as the 1960 movie starring Rod Taylor, but it's still a nice piece of mind candy.",4,He's Not Using His Hands,1338768000,"06 4, 2012",2012,1587,"['TIME', 'MACHINE', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'really', ""n't"", 'make', 'great', 'movie', 'one', 'true', 'text', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'book', 'was', 'more', 'commentary', 'society', 'science', 'fiction', 'novel', 'said', 'TIME', 'MACHINE', 'movie', 'directed', 'Simon', 'Wells', 'rocking', 'adventure', 'full', 'excitement.The', 'movie', 'stars', 'Guy', 'Pierce', 'L.A', 'CONFIDENTIAL', 'MEMENTO', 'Alexander', 'Hartdegen', 'Hartdegen', 'professor', 'Columbia', 'University', 'several', 'eccentricies', 'correspondence', 'German', 'clerk', 'Albert', 'Einstein', 'Hartdegen', 'interest', 'things', 'mechanical', 'strange', 'fascination', 'time', 'However', 'overwhelming', 'tragedy', 'focus', 'Hartdegen', 'energies', 'building', 'time', 'machine', 'past', 'future', 'knock', 'head', 'travel', '800,000', 'years', 'farther', 'future', 'planned', 'two', 'races', 'men', 'peaceful', 'Eloi', 'cannabilistic', 'Morlocks', 'Alex', 'faced', 'choice', 'decision', 'will', 'affect', 'time.Simon', 'Wells', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'putting', 'together', 'action', 'packed', 'science', 'fiction', 'adventure', 'true', 'movie', 'not', 'much', 'resemble', 'great-grandfather', 'novel', 'However', 'Simon', 'Wells', 'did', 'not', 'write', 'script', 'just', 'had', 'opportunity', 'work', 'something', 'have', 'family', 'connection.Anyway', 'movie', 'fairly', 'fast', 'paced', 'not', 'try', 'explain', 'time', 'travel', 'such', 'great', 'BACK', 'TO', 'THE', 'FUTURE', 'few', 'plot', 'holes', 'movie', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'as', 'good', '1960', 'movie', 'starring', 'Rod', 'Taylor', 'still', 'nice', 'piece', 'mind', 'candy']",N/A
588423,A32PBNS7SGYRWE,B00005JKLZ,twobitcoder,"[0, 0]","This movie is sort of fun during the first hour, but the ending is just so disappointing. It would have been better to have followed the story a little more closely. The vampire super-intellectual monster guy (Irons) was a curve ball that was totally out of place. The film clearly suffers from losing it's director before it was completed, since the new director did not do much more than just blow everything up and roll the credits. Taking the story into causality does not do justice to the original H.G. Wells novel. There are plenty of time travel stories out there; if you're going to do Wells, do it accurately, not as a revisionist story.The second major problem with the film is the casting of the protagonist, and it sort of fails clear to the end. Guy Pearce is a good actor, but he does certain roles really well, not others not so well. This was not a good role for him; he's not believable as an engineer or physicist, let alone a tinkerer. Where Pearce works really well is wearing a uniform (a character of a character). He doesn't pull off a believable character on his own very well.The main reason I watch this film every so often is for a very exotic Samantha Mumba--who has, sadly, not done another film. She was a natural choice for a tropical native girl. And, I thought the village on the cliff was more interesting than the temple-like structure of the original film.I found the special effects to be sub-par but effective. The Morlocks were better as slower-moving bipeds rather than beastly creatures that run and jump like tigers. The original film (and novel) was quite scary with slow-moving Morlocks, so there was no need to make them fast-moving, hot-blooded beasts.Fans will want to be sure to read Stephen Baxter's novel, ""The Time Ships"", for a further treatment of this character.",4,Missed opportunity but still enjoyable,1335398400,"04 26, 2012",2012,1817,"['movie', 'sort', 'fun', 'first', 'hour', 'ending', 'just', 'so', 'disappointing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'have', 'followed', 'story', 'little', 'more', 'closely', 'vampire', 'super-intellectual', 'monster', 'guy', 'Irons', 'was', 'curve', 'ball', 'was', 'totally', 'place', 'film', 'clearly', 'suffers', 'losing', 'director', 'was', 'completed', 'new', 'director', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'blow', 'everything', 'up', 'roll', 'credits', 'Taking', 'story', 'causality', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'original', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'novel', 'are', 'plenty', 'time', 'travel', 'stories', 'there', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', 'Wells', 'do', 'accurately', 'not', 'revisionist', 'story.The', 'second', 'major', 'problem', 'film', 'casting', 'protagonist', 'sort', 'fails', 'clear', 'end', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'good', 'actor', 'certain', 'roles', 'really', 'well', 'not', 'others', 'not', 'so', 'well', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'role', 'not', 'believable', 'engineer', 'physicist', 'let', 'alone', 'tinkerer', 'Where', 'Pearce', 'really', 'well', 'wearing', 'uniform', 'character', 'character', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'believable', 'character', 'own', 'very', 'well.The', 'main', 'reason', 'watch', 'film', 'so', 'often', 'very', 'exotic', 'Samantha', 'Mumba', 'who', 'sadly', 'not', 'done', 'film', 'was', 'natural', 'choice', 'tropical', 'native', 'girl', 'thought', 'village', 'cliff', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'temple-like', 'structure', 'original', 'film.I', 'found', 'special', 'effects', 'be', 'sub-par', 'effective', 'Morlocks', 'were', 'better', 'slower-moving', 'bipeds', 'rather', 'beastly', 'run', 'jump', 'tigers', 'original', 'film', 'novel', 'was', 'quite', 'scary', 'slow-moving', 'Morlocks', 'was', 'need', 'make', 'fast-moving', 'hot-blooded', 'beasts.Fans', 'will', 'want', 'be', 'sure', 'read', 'Stephen', 'Baxter', 'novel', 'Time', 'Ships', 'further', 'treatment', 'character']",N/A

What is the point of merely rehashing Wells' &quot;Time Machine?&quot; I thought this movie would show some new perspective, some interesting nuance, a dimension of the future I have not even thought about. I was disappointed.While intellectually this movie is vacant, it has decent special effects and good, albeit short, acting by Jeremy Irons. Look, H.G. Wells was scandalized by two important world-historic events that took place in Victorian England: the widespread scientific acceptance of the theory of evolution and the transformation of society due to the Industrial Revolution. His original &quot;Time Machine&quot; is an imaginative and socially conscious fusion of these occurrences presented in the form of the written word. But why would the movie made in 2002, made as it was in a different historical era, divorced from the same historical circumstances, would want to agonize over Victorian fears? The fears of which the current generation as a whole has no inkling. What do 99 percent of the people living in America today know of the horrors of 19th century factories, miserable working class lifestyles, and the shock to the conscience of decent God-fear proper people triggered by the spread of the theory of evolution?There is a minor new twist in this film. I want to be completely fair, you see. The movie does not blame class division or industrialization per se for the catastrophe of the human race being divided into two: one effete and docile, another predatory and unconscionable. But greed and the desire for good life are blamed. Apparently some corporation was building a resort on the Moon, and the explosion conducted as a part of the construction process, broke the whole Moon into several pieces, changing the orbit of the Earth and its climate. Those greedy corporations with their constant hunt for profits! And what about the decadent people who fuel the demand for their services! Imagine, these lazy, conspicuous consumption folks--they want to vacation on the Moon!In the end, I did not care. The Morlocks could eat all the Eloi, if they wanted to. What's it to me? Near the end of this fiasco, Guy Pearce lectures Jeremy Irons about the &quot;human cost&quot; involved in the food chain arrangement on Earth.

588429,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00005JKLZ,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[0, 0]","This isn't a remake, exactly. It's clear that Simon Wells was attempting an update on his great-grandfather's original story. Retaining just the original skeleton of the plot (and making a witty reference to both the novel and the first film), Wells has fashioned a decidedly different parable about the modern world.Beyond his need to experiment,The Time Traveler (as he was referred to in the original story)finally has a compelling personal reason to try his machine.  It's also clear why he goes forward vs. backward--the despair of his character and his hopes of understanding the paradox that prevents him from changing the past prompts him to lose himself in the future.Guy Pearce gives a nice multilayered performance. Jeremy Irons is deliciously wicked as the leader of the Morlocks. It's finally clear not only how such a situation could have occurred but why it thrived in the first place. Wells' self assured direction sometimes can work to his disadvantage; there are a number of minor plot threads that aren't well developed and the second half has a couple of minor plot flaws that unravel if you examine them too closely.The CGI effects are impressive particularly when compared to the top drawer stop motion effects from the original film. Again, the effects aren't perfect (and could have been a bit more developed) but work well within the context of the story. The sequence set in New York when the (spoiler alert folks!)moon crumbles with chunks of it destorying the city is an impressive, powerful set piece and counter balances the main theme. It's clear that, despite the Time Traveler's gifts, he can't undo the past or change significant portions of the future. So he choses to make a change on a personal level and save those he can.The dialog is a bit clunky at times and it's clear that the script passed through many different hands before the final draft. Writing by committee has been the undoing of many a great film (Blade Runner is a fine example or Tim Burton's ""reimagining"" of Planet of the Apes).On the whole, though, The Time Machine is still a powerful, political commentary on mankind and the dark desires that drive us as a species. I'm a huge fan of the original George Pal directed film and feel that Wells managed to develop a film that pays hommage to the past while bravely charting its own course towards the future.It's clear that Wells is technically gifted as a director and this first live action effort promises much from him.

Also, though I haven't read Welles' original in some time, I have doubts about its faithfulness to the original.The plot is simple enough. Brilliant but obsessed scientist suffers a terrible loss, then creates the time machine to go back and recover what was lost. When that doesn't work, he skips forward through time, and an accident lands him in the distant futre. Mankind has split into two subspecies, the peaceful, pastoral Eloi and the vicious (and a little more technologically oriented) Morlocks. Our hero saves the world and lives happily every after. [Vague, I know, but I prefer to avoid spoilers.]The steam-punk look of the time machine is well done. The look of the Eloi village is distinctive, but very reminiscent of the Myst games. There was interesting continuity of the traveler's steps into the future, including the one character that reappears in different eons.A few things left me confused, though. The Morlocks use blowguns with some vile mix in the darts. As near as I can tell, though, the only effect of a dart is to leave a black stain - I never did see toxic effects in the people hit by them. Also, a relatively small nuclear blast was enough to break up the moon. Huh? You don't need to be a physicist here. Some of those lunar craters came from meteor impacts that released the energy of nuclear blasts, big ones, and the moon held up just fine. Breaking up the moon would mean overcoming the gravitational attraction that holds all the pieces together. No human bomb is anywhere near that energy range.It's a decent enough way to kill an evening.

Loved the many different people of varying backgrounds, the special effects, the script, the actors and actreses.  It refelcts more reality than the original which created an environment that ""people of color"" never existed.  This is not reality and regretfully Hollywood has done this since its existence.  Or, people of color were always shown in an extremely bad light; there was an unhealthy imbalance of good and evil.  There is a total disregard of the many essential contributions made by people of color.  You can and must not continually deny these contributions to this society and these old films consistently did that.  The 1960s Time Machine did not represent a true picture of the world.  In that version everyone came from one ethnic background and this is totally unfair to the many different peoples of the world.  Whenever there were important inventions, discoveries, etc. there was always people of color contributing but their contributions were removed or stolen. People, read your history not the edited versions!The (revised) Time Machine was and is a great movie along with 2012 (Director: Roland Emmerich; Writers: Roland Emmerich, Harald Kloser.  Stars: John Cusack, Thandie Newton and Chiwetel Ejiofor is extremely inclusive (and I must say a few other films) of all nationalities and this we should all be proud. Had to include additional information of the 2012 because there was another 2012 which was intentionally non inclusive and had only one ethnic group involved; again, removing all people of color.  I was so taken aback that I didn't watch the entire movie.  The acting was cheesy, unbelievable, and completely clumsy in its presentation as well.Castatrophic events of the world naturally involve all people of color in every aspect of life which include scientists, inventors, etc.  It has been proven over and over again and again that one ethnic group does not have all the answers but that when we work together we can accomplish what is needed.Attempts to hold other groups down prevent the dominant group from rising.
