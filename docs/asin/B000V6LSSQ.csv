1099163,A2TWB28MME7CUR,B000V6LSSQ,Barb E.,"[1, 1]","A Christmas Visitor takes you into the story. The acting is done very natural. It could be very sad for someone to watch around Christmas that has lost a loved one in combat which would already be having a hard time. It can also give hope for someone thinking they may have cancer or console someone who has lost a child or sibling in battle. I like it. The bonus movie, Angel in the family, is too far out there for me. I don't care for it, since it came as a bonus I'm not out anything.",5,A Christmas Visitor is a touching story,1323993600,"12 16, 2011",2011,488,"['Christmas', 'Visitor', 'story', 'acting', 'done', 'very', 'natural', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'sad', 'someone', 'watch', 'around', 'Christmas', 'lost', 'loved', 'one', 'combat', 'would', 'already', 'be', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'can', 'also', 'give', 'hope', 'someone', 'thinking', 'may', 'have', 'cancer', 'console', 'someone', 'who', 'lost', 'child', 'sibling', 'battle', 'bonus', 'movie', 'Angel', 'family', 'too', 'far', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'came', 'bonus', ""'m"", 'not', 'anything']",A Christmas Visitor Movie: Angel in the Family
