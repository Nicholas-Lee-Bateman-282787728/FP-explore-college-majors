1078513,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000R348Q2,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","I have to admit that The Ferryman wasn't nearly as bad a movie as I was expecting - at least it didn't suck my will to live out of my body as I watched it.  Leaving aside the whole supernatural aspect of the story, though, the film does have a significant problem in terms of the silly direction Chris Graham (the director) allowed things to take in the final half hour.  Letting a person steal another person's body by stabbing them to death with an ancient knife is bad enough, but having both parties flop around like fish out of water for upwards of a minute as the body transfer takes place just opens the floodgates of laughter and ridicule.  There's also no way to rationalize one crucial aspect of the film's most climactic scene.  All hope is not necessarily lost, though, as the writers and director redeem themselves somewhat with an ending that invites failure but ends up working quite well (and I'm not just saying that because one of the actresses suddenly becomes about ten times as attractive as she had already been up to that point).If you've ever wondered what happened to Charon, this movie has the answer: apparently, he's been tooling around the South Pacific for a couple of thousand years trying to track down a customer who got off without paying him.  That kind of stick-to-itiveness is probably what got him promoted up to head Ferryman back in the day, so let know one question this old timer's job commitment - especially when there are so many other things about this storyline to question, from the whole ""body transfer knife"" to the deus ex machina in little girl's clothing.  We're never told anything about the knife's origins, nor do we know where Charon's unpaying customer found it.  All we know is that our main characters' fancy yacht trip turns out to be an unmitigated disaster, even before a dense fog rolls in and the crew picks up a stranded sailor (John Rhys-Davies).  Even though this guy has been stranded out in the middle of the ocean for who knows how long, Charon is suddenly hot on his trail once he sets foot on the Dionysus (that's the name of the yacht).  In other words, it doesn't take our bad guy long to start switching bodies.If you love animals as passionately as I do, be warned that this cinematic voyage will not be smooth sailing.  One fairly lengthy section of the film is particularly hard to sit through.  The stereotypical blonde, self-absorbed, high maintenance female character also may not sit well with feminists. Here's what really bothers me about this film, though.  John Rhys-Davies' character has a huge tattoo on his back, and that tattoo stays with him as he moves from one body to another.  Sure, its figure of a snake representing infinity, but we all know the director put that bloody huge tattoo there because he thinks at least some in his audience are too stupid to figure out the dumb body transfer plot point on their own.  That's really subtle, Mr. Director.Despite all of its problems, though, The Ferryman is still a halfway decent horror film.  It never rises to the occasion of generating any suspense (especially since we always know whose body the bad guy happens to be inhabiting), and things get pretty darn silly toward the end, but it does serve up a reasonable amount of blood and a much better ending than you would ever expect from a film such as this.",3,"Far from smooth sailing, but it gets you there in the end",1214611200,"06 28, 2008",2008,3355,"['have', 'admit', 'Ferryman', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'movie', 'was', 'expecting', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'suck', 'will', 'live', 'body', 'watched', 'Leaving', 'whole', 'supernatural', 'aspect', 'story', 'though', 'film', 'have', 'significant', 'problem', 'terms', 'silly', 'direction', 'Chris', 'Graham', 'director', 'allowed', 'things', 'take', 'final', 'half', 'hour', 'Letting', 'person', 'steal', 'person', 'body', 'stabbing', 'death', 'ancient', 'knife', 'bad', 'enough', 'having', 'parties', 'flop', 'fish', 'water', 'upwards', 'minute', 'body', 'transfer', 'place', 'just', 'floodgates', 'laughter', 'ridicule', 'also', 'way', 'rationalize', 'one', 'crucial', 'aspect', 'film', 'most', 'climactic', 'scene', 'hope', 'not', 'necessarily', 'lost', 'though', 'writers', 'director', 'redeem', 'somewhat', 'ending', 'failure', 'up', 'working', 'quite', 'well', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'saying', 'one', 'actresses', 'suddenly', 'about', 'ten', 'times', 'as', 'attractive', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'up', 'point', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'wondered', 'what', 'happened', 'Charon', 'movie', 'answer', 'apparently', 'been', 'tooling', 'South', 'Pacific', 'couple', 'thousand', 'years', 'trying', 'track', 'down', 'customer', 'who', 'got', 'off', 'paying', 'kind', 'stick-to-itiveness', 'probably', 'what', 'got', 'promoted', 'up', 'head', 'Ferryman', 'back', 'day', 'so', 'let', 'know', 'one', 'question', 'old', 'timer', 'job', 'commitment', 'especially', 'when', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'storyline', 'question', 'whole', 'body', 'transfer', 'knife', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'little', 'girl', 'clothing', ""'re"", 'never', 'told', 'anything', 'knife', 'origins', 'do', 'know', 'where', 'Charon', 'unpaying', 'customer', 'found', 'know', 'main', 'characters', 'fancy', 'yacht', 'trip', 'out', 'be', 'unmitigated', 'disaster', 'even', 'dense', 'fog', 'rolls', 'crew', 'up', 'stranded', 'sailor', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies', 'Even', 'guy', 'been', 'stranded', 'out', 'middle', 'ocean', 'who', 'how', 'long', 'Charon', 'suddenly', 'hot', 'trail', 'once', 'foot', 'Dionysus', 'name', 'yacht', 'other', 'words', ""n't"", 'take', 'bad', 'guy', 'long', 'start', 'switching', 'bodies.If', 'love', 'animals', 'as', 'passionately', 'do', 'be', 'warned', 'cinematic', 'voyage', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'smooth', 'sailing', 'One', 'fairly', 'lengthy', 'section', 'film', 'particularly', 'hard', 'sit', 'stereotypical', 'blonde', 'self-absorbed', 'high', 'maintenance', 'female', 'character', 'also', 'may', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'feminists', 'Here', 'what', 'really', 'film', 'though', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies', 'character', 'huge', 'tattoo', 'back', 'tattoo', 'stays', 'one', 'body', 'Sure', 'figure', 'snake', 'representing', 'infinity', 'know', 'director', 'put', 'bloody', 'huge', 'tattoo', 'there', 'least', 'audience', 'are', 'too', 'stupid', 'figure', 'out', 'dumb', 'body', 'transfer', 'plot', 'point', 'own', 'really', 'subtle', 'Mr.', 'Director.Despite', 'problems', 'though', 'Ferryman', 'still', 'halfway', 'decent', 'horror', 'film', 'never', 'occasion', 'generating', 'suspense', 'especially', 'always', 'know', 'body', 'bad', 'guy', 'be', 'inhabiting', 'things', 'get', 'pretty', 'darn', 'silly', 'end', 'serve', 'up', 'reasonable', 'amount', 'blood', 'much', 'better', 'ending', 'would', 'ever', 'expect', 'film', 'such']",The Ferryman

I was cheered by the start, seeing that it wasn't a lo quality production and the actors didn't seem to be amateurs or friends of the film maker. I have seen, or started to watch, too many of those lately... Well, color me surprised when I started to really get into it. I really liked all the characters, except the American girlfriend (insect brain... haha... good one) but even she started growing on me. I especially liked who turned out to be the main protags, the Maori couple. So, once the action kicks off, its like bodies musical chairs! (What a shame that the best body was swapped right away!) That was very entertaining and while its been attempted in other flicks (spontaneously shifting possession at least) I haven't seen it done in this context. Kudos for bringing me something new!  The acting was competent but there was definitely some camp in there. Don't go in expecting a totally 'serious' horror movie. However, the humor is a byproduct of the plot. Its not comedic in intent. So, its not a jokey horror movie either. Its just an entertaining little flick.Now, the ugly.... If I were in the room with the filmmaker when the dog sequence happened, I would've assaulted him. I have never, and I mean never, been so twisted up inside and horrified by the use of an animal in horror movies. That alone says a lot. To be clear, it wasn't gratuitous, though, which is why I am not dinging it a star or two or three for that. It was not just a nanosecond, but a segment of around 3-4 scenes involving this poor creature that was just harrowing.

I love Mr. Rhys-Davies, but lately his name on a film hasn't been an indication of quality.  Surprisingly, The Ferryman actually delivers.The Ferryman is about a body-hopping sorcerer who wields an enchantedknife.  Whomever he stabs with the knife swaps bodies with him.  We start in media res with the final two inhabitants of another voyage battling each other to death, before only the Greek (Rhys-Davies) is left.  Of course, our six victims pick him up.There's not a lot of room on the boat to maneuver, but The Ferryman works with its limited set. The Ferryman is thick with accents (it was filmed in Australia) and some cultural nuances may be lost on American audience (references to the Maori).  Because there's not much to do on the boat, there's actually quite a bit of dialogue between the various victims.  The conflicts take place primarily between genders, as the couples' relationships are strained by the intrusion of an ancient sorcerer who happens to enjoy women.The movie hinges on two actresses: hot blonde Sally Stockwell (Tate) and cute brunette Amber Sainsbury (Kathy). Kathy gets some supernatural help in visions of a dead little girl she was unable to save in her past life as a nurse. That deus ex machina gives Kathy the knowledge she needs to defeat the possessed Tate: an obloi, the Greek coin to pay Charon so that he may ferry the dead across the river Styx.An undercurrent of sexual tension crackles throughout The Ferryman. The sorcerer's taste in women is persistent regardless of gender and he isn't above manipulating the various attractive females into compromising positions. Even the climactic battle at the end involves a lesbian kiss.The Ferryman's characters aren't particularly fleshed out.  It's not hard to guess that the blonde in the slinky dress is going to be the center of attention or that the ex-nurse has a secret.

That makes for a nicely claustrophobic atmosphere. They see another boat, apparently abandoned.Abandoned &#34;ghost ships&#34; are a horror staple, but the trope is well handled here. Eerie and spooky.These people find a lone survivor on board -- a grizzled sailor -- but of course, he's not what he seems. They bring him aboard their own boat and, well, it's kind of like ANACONDA, when those nice city folk brought the grizzled Jon Voight aboard their boat. Not a good idea, trapped in the middle of nowhere with a mysterious stranger.In this case, the sailor turns out to be supernatural. He has the ability to switch bodies -- but he must kill to do it. And he keeps switching bodies, so the body count mounts. Happily, it's a generous body count, with lots of good guy/sympathetic victims. That's important in a horror film.Once the killings start, the pace never lets up.It's a basic horror tale, with basic character types. The bitchy blonde and her hen-pecked wuss of a boyfriend. The smart brunette and her strong, silent type beau. Even so, there are shocks and surprises -- and not arbitrary surprises. I didn't see some of the plot twists coming, but when they occurred, they made sense, having been nicely set up.Yes, it's true. The ferryman angle is barely explored. The fabled ferryman of Greek mythology only appears in the end. The villain -- the sailor who keeps switching bodies -- isn't the ferryman, but an ancient soul who's trying to evade the ferryman. That's not a spoiler -- it's pretty evident early on that he's not the ferryman.THE FERRYMAN is not a horror classic. It's not terribly original (though thankfully, it's not the usual college kids hunted by a slasher or Japanese type ghost -- way too many of those recently).
