292796,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,6302038286,A. Gammill,"[5, 6]","Like so many products of the 80's, The Gate succeeds more on nostalgia than actual entertainment value.  But that's not to say it isn't worth watching.  In fact, it's probably one of the best films of its kind: Low-budget, mid-to-late 80's PG-13 horror with a then-unknown cast, and a generous amount of special effects.What also strikes me about it, years later, is that the story itself more resembles an old-fashioned monster movie than a teen horror flick.  I still get a kick out of watching the basic plot (kids inadvertently unlock a gateway to another dimension, unleashing demonic critters) tick by like clockwork.  And it's all fairly inoffensive, though there are still a handful of decent scares.Even without the nostalgia factor, I think this is a fine kid's horror film.  Great for a Saturday matinee or a Halloween marathon paired with TREMORS or Fred Dekker's THE MONSTER SQUAD (for which a DVD release is long overdue).",3,"Good cheap thrills, especially for younger viewers",1157587200,"09 7, 2006",2006,936,"['so', 'many', 'products', '80', 'Gate', 'more', 'nostalgia', 'actual', 'entertainment', 'value', 'not', 'say', ""n't"", 'worth', 'watching', 'fact', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'kind', 'Low-budget', 'mid-to-late', '80', 'PG-13', 'horror', 'then-unknown', 'cast', 'generous', 'amount', 'special', 'effects.What', 'also', 'years', 'later', 'story', 'more', 'resembles', 'old-fashioned', 'monster', 'movie', 'teen', 'horror', 'flick', 'still', 'get', 'kick', 'watching', 'basic', 'plot', 'kids', 'inadvertently', 'unlock', 'gateway', 'dimension', 'unleashing', 'demonic', 'critters', 'tick', 'clockwork', 'fairly', 'inoffensive', 'are', 'still', 'handful', 'decent', 'scares.Even', 'nostalgia', 'factor', 'think', 'fine', 'kid', 'horror', 'film', 'Great', 'Saturday', 'matinee', 'Halloween', 'marathon', 'paired', 'TREMORS', 'Fred', 'Dekker', 'THE', 'MONSTER', 'SQUAD', 'DVD', 'release', 'long', 'overdue']",N/A
292797,A13QNGUB9IYTY4,6302038286,"A Hermit ""J.Hamric""","[5, 6]","The films of the 1980's, good and bad, all have a certain look and feel to them. Just look; if one pays attention to the cinematography and set design, there is something to the era that came and went over time, so for the people who were there the first time around, this is a trip down Memory Lane.This isn't a great movie, but it does entertain, so it doesn't fail, it's just not a particularly great one. Glen, the film's hero, is a young boy who is treated with disdain by his older sister and her friends, and can sense something is about to go horribly wrong. His best friend, a bitter boy named Terry, is into lots of dark things: a rock band whose members allegedly indulged in Satanism (a HUGE issue at the time; look up Frank Zappa's 1985 appearance before the U.S. Senate), keeping bugs in jars, telling creepy stories and the like. He misses his late mother, and even dreams about seeing her again. The viewer here gets to know these characters on a deeper level; commendable, looking at the ""Friday The 13th"" films at the time. You meet the characters and then they die. Here, despite some occasional less-than-successful acting, you see what the key players are made of. They are real people, with real feelings and have pasts. Yet they are all teenagers and pre-teens; I can remember being that young (1970's, for me), and life was so different then. Again, it's a time capsule.There are some moments of real emotion in this film, notably when the Terry character sleeps over; the dog, a very old dog, presumed sleeping in the hall, is actually dead, and Terry dreams his dead mother visits him. He hugs her and is crying, but he is actually sleepwalking. He wakes up to see he is holding the dog, and understandably screams his head off when he realizes he's holding a dead animal, instead of a loved, missed family member. The next day Glen is looking at some  photographs of the dog and the soundtrack is playing some gentle, sad music as the boy is remembering his dog. Who isn't going to be teary-eyed at this? ANY time the family's dog dies in a film, somebody will be crying, if not in the film itself, then it will be somebody who is watching.As well, there are some really disturbing images in this film: the man behind the wall for one. And keep in mind the phrase, ""...YOU'VE BEEN BAAAAD!!!..."" And possibly my favorite scene, the one where this greenish-brown tornado, several miles tall ascends from this ""gate,"" spreading the evil all over the countryside. That is really cool to see. Not evil per se, just how that bit looks.""The Gate"" is seriously a throw-back film, but not a bad one.My favorite line from the movie: ""Suck my nose till my head caves in!""",3,A trip back to the 1980's; 3 1/2 stars?,1295049600,"01 15, 2011",2011,2687,"['films', '1980', 'good', 'bad', 'have', 'certain', 'look', 'feel', 'Just', 'look', 'one', 'attention', 'cinematography', 'set', 'design', 'something', 'era', 'came', 'went', 'time', 'so', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'trip', 'down', 'Memory', 'Lane.This', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'entertain', ""n't"", 'fail', 'just', 'not', 'particularly', 'great', 'one', 'Glen', 'film', 'hero', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'treated', 'disdain', 'older', 'sister', 'friends', 'can', 'sense', 'something', 'go', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'best', 'friend', 'bitter', 'boy', 'named', 'Terry', 'lots', 'dark', 'things', 'rock', 'band', 'members', 'allegedly', 'indulged', 'Satanism', 'HUGE', 'issue', 'time', 'look', 'up', 'Frank', 'Zappa', '1985', 'appearance', 'U.S.', 'Senate', 'keeping', 'bugs', 'jars', 'telling', 'creepy', 'stories', 'like', 'late', 'mother', 'even', 'dreams', 'seeing', 'again', 'viewer', 'here', 'know', 'characters', 'deeper', 'level', 'commendable', 'looking', 'Friday', '13th', 'films', 'time', 'meet', 'characters', 'then', 'die', 'Here', 'occasional', 'less-than-successful', 'acting', 'see', 'what', 'key', 'players', 'are', 'made', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'feelings', 'have', 'pasts', 'are', 'teenagers', 'pre-teens', 'can', 'remember', 'being', 'young', '1970', 'life', 'was', 'so', 'different', 'then', 'Again', 'time', 'are', 'moments', 'real', 'emotion', 'film', 'notably', 'when', 'Terry', 'character', 'sleeps', 'dog', 'very', 'old', 'dog', 'presumed', 'sleeping', 'hall', 'actually', 'dead', 'Terry', 'dead', 'mother', 'hugs', 'crying', 'actually', 'sleepwalking', 'up', 'see', 'holding', 'dog', 'understandably', 'screams', 'head', 'when', 'holding', 'dead', 'animal', 'instead', 'loved', 'missed', 'family', 'member', 'next', 'day', 'Glen', 'looking', 'photographs', 'dog', 'soundtrack', 'playing', 'gentle', 'sad', 'music', 'boy', 'remembering', 'dog', 'Who', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'teary-eyed', 'ANY', 'time', 'family', 'dog', 'film', 'somebody', 'will', 'be', 'crying', 'not', 'film', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'somebody', 'who', 'watching.As', 'well', 'are', 'really', 'disturbing', 'images', 'film', 'man', 'wall', 'one', 'keep', 'mind', 'phrase', 'YOU', ""'VE"", 'BEEN', 'BAAAAD', 'possibly', 'favorite', 'scene', 'one', 'where', 'greenish-brown', 'tornado', 'several', 'miles', 'tall', 'ascends', 'gate', 'spreading', 'evil', 'countryside', 'really', 'cool', 'see', 'Not', 'evil', 'se', 'just', 'how', 'bit', 'Gate', 'seriously', 'throw-back', 'film', 'not', 'bad', 'one.My', 'favorite', 'line', 'movie', 'Suck', 'nose', 'head', 'caves']",N/A

292807,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,6302038286,Carl Manes,"[5, 6]","THE GATE is a nostalgic reminder of childhood fears that offers some of the most amazing effects of any low budget Horror entry. The film begins inconspicuously enough with two young boys uncovering a geode in a hole in the backyard. After cracking it open and reading an ancient inscription generated by the stone, the two unwittingly unlock a gateway to another dimension that unleashes the evil spirits and demonic entities that were locked within. Although the picture is kid-friendly for the most part, it is not without its scares. There are several deathly terrifying sequences throughout the plot, the most disturbing of which involve the demons masking themselves as evil versions of the kids' parents while attempting to destroy them. Each of the young actors (including Stephen Dorff in an early role) deliver strong performances that feel genuine and relateable.The most memorable aspects of THE GATE are unquestionably the special FX work. For a film of its size and scale, no other film boasts such an incredible production design. In addition to stop-motion animation, director Tibor Takacs also incorporates miniature set designs with gigantic demonic beasts as well as tiny minions that each interact with the children in a series of incredible green-screening shots that seamlessly meld the range of characters on screen. Though it takes its time in creating a growing tension and suspense, the gate literally unleashes hell on earth once it has been fully unlocked. THE GATE is the perfect argument against the use of computerized imaging in film, and serves as one of the strongest examples of a low budget Horror film accomplishing a big budget look and feel through imaginative FX and a unique plot.

I did and I did, have the urge, and dig a hole, that is...all I found was a ceramic pipe (which I accidentally cracked), but that was about it.  Had I seen The Gate (1987) prior to digging that hole, I may have chosen not to, as there are things under the Earth best left undisturbed...Directed by Tibor Tak&aacute;cs, whose credits include mostly television work and a few films like I, Madman  (1989) and Deathline (1997), a Rutger Hauer vehicle of little consequence (it was all downhill after his most excellent role as Roy Batty in the quintessential sci-fi film Blade Runner), The Gate stars Stephen Dorff, in his first movie role.  His most notable appearance for me was in the vampire thriller Blade (1998), as the villainous, murderous Deacon Frost, who later became the Blood God (he was such a nice young boy, and now look at him...) .  Also in the film is Christa Denton, who mostly appeared on television in the 80's, but also appeared in A Million Ways to Die (1986), a pretty good B-film worth checking out, and Louis Tripp, an actor of few credentials, but who can also be seen in the film Detroit Rock City (1999), as The Nerdy Kid (I'm not kidding, that's how it's listed).The film opens with Glen (a very young Dorff) witnessing the removal of a large, old tree from the backyard of his parent's house.  Soon after, Glen's friend Terry (Tripp) comes over, and the pair find part of a geode, a hollow, usually spheroidal rock with crystals lining the inside wall, in the up heaved Earth.  Terry, ever the troublemaker (every neighborhood has one...he's the kid who kept bugs in jars to see how long they could live without air or tied firecrackers to cat's tails...we find out later the reason he `jest ain't right' is probably due to the fact his mother passed recently), talks Glen into digging up the yard to look for more geodes as Terry figures they could become rich as people paid good money for them, sometime `up to 100 bucks'.  Ahh, to be young and ignorant...well, I'll settle for one as I'm loaded with the other...you decide which...anyway, as they dig, a huge hole opens up, and it turns out to be a portal to a realm of demons, but the portal has yet to be opened fully.  That happens later, inadvertently, as certain events occurs, to which the boys determined this by reading the extensive liner notes on one of Terry's heavy metal albums (the band was called Sacrifix, with their main schtick being dabbling in the dark arts).  Well, strange things begin happening, and activity from the hole increases, so I guess it's pretty lucky that Glen's parents are away for a few days, leaving him in the care of his sister, Al (Denton), short for Allison, I believe, because all hell is about to break loose, literally.  So what do these pesky demons want?  Why, to take control of the Earth, for their own nefarious purposes.  Nice going Glen and Terry...I suppose you've doomed us all to eternal damnation and suffering with the pointy pitchforks to the nether regions and such, and I don't even want to think how you're going to explain all this to your parents when they come back...The film was pretty well done, and much better than one might expect.  The acting and dialogue seems a bit wooden and shallow at times, but there seems to be a real honesty and heart emanating from within the characters, and little or no attempt to `Hollywood' them up, trying to make them more than what they are...these are characters you could known, been friends with...the plot moves along nicely, and while there are a few holes here and there, I found none so large as to make me roll my eyes or drive a bus through.  The movie has the effect of drawing you in, creating interest in the likeable characters (I felt empathy as Glen looked over some old photos of the family dog after it passed, reminiscing about a friend now gone.  While meant to evoke an emotional response, it didn't appear to be an obvious attempt, which I appreciated).  The special effects, while not state of the art, even back in 1987, were actually very professional, which is a bit surprising given the minimal budget I'm sure this film was working on...I saw this film on cable back in the late 80's, and it kinda stuck with me.  Why?  It's hard to say.  It wasn't terribly scary, or very bloody, but it does have its' charms.  Maybe it's the sense that the movie isn't trying to be more than it is, forgoing the over-the-top theatrics for a bit of substance and its' general sense of overall fun.  Also, I think the fact that most of the people working on and in this movie seemed to be at the beginning of their careers, and hadn't really had an opportunity to be subverted and perverted by the system, Hollywood, that is...there is a certain amount of predictability within the story, but it was easy to overlook, as the excitement the movie draws from the viewer is fairly constant, at least once the plot elements are established.  The picture quality on this release is surprisingly good, but I was disappointed to see that only the full screen format was included on the disk.  Also, there is nothing in the way of special features.  All in all, this is a four star film, but given the lackluster release, I have go with a three star rating.  By the by, there was a sequel to The Gate, released in 1992 called Gate II: The Trespassers, with only Tripp reviving his original role.Cookieman108",3,Dorff on demons...,1094688000,"09 9,

I was probably around 10 when I saw it a number of times on the premium channels.  And it stayed with me.  Prior to this the only DVD available was an old out of print fullscreen release being sold used for ridiculously high prices, so I'm glad I waited for this nice clean widescreen version.  Besides the nostalgia factor this film really holds up as some very nice storytelling.  It was made to be family friendly, something the writer was disappointed in according to the bonus features, but that doesn't stop it from having a number of genuinely creepy moments and great scares.  I'm not embarrassed to say that as a kid I used to be afraid to look at my left palm because of a particular scene.  The visual effects were great for the times as well.  It's hard to imagine 8 inch tall creatures posing a real threat, but look at their faces and tell me that doesn't give you shivers.

The carcass of the family dog is tossed therein after it had perished under strange causes thought to be due to natural circumstances, or perhaps more appropriately, ""supernatural causes""?The boys, one a quiet unassuming type named Glenn, quite regular in most every way; and the other, Terry, a hell-raising spitfire donned in denim with Heavy Metal patches {one noticeable one was a back-patch of Venom's ""From Hell To The Unknown"" double-album which, incidently, I had signed by the band in silver Magic Marker}, displaying the image of a blue transmutating phantom with red pentagrams for eyes. His room carries all of the elements as well ?posters wallpaper it with Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, AC/DC, and the occasional Venom and Slayer prints. Although instead of long black hair, a pentagram medallion and perhaps an inverted cross earring with rings on every finger, he is clean cut and wears glasses ?an interesting combination, as the former was said to always accompany the previous description, and the latter was said to accompany the ""nerd"" aesthetic. One would suspect that it is he who would undertake this perilous journey, but alas, it is the other, but it is his passion that fuels the adventure forward to manifest the nefarious prophesies in The Dark Book. As more and more omens become manifest, these little albino-like creatures begin appearing everywhere, chasing the boys about the house. When one is struck, they separate into smaller remnants of themselves. Finally, the boys realize what must be done after listening to the album backwards, and begin trying to banish ""the evil"" with passages from the moldy babble! According to the typical horror-movie scenario, this would normally work, but not in this case. Instead, the book erupts into flames, and Terry is pulled down into the foggy pit where he encounters a gaggle of the little pale imps with glossy black eyes pulling and tearing at his legs until his struggling finally breaks him loose, only to become subsequently possessed to attack Glenn {who is speared in the eye by a barbie doll}, as do all who accompany him in this quest, each of which he must dispatch in various gory manners, including his sister Alexandra, a pretentious air-headed cliquish assimilate who was also previously attacked by the zombified corpse of a workman killed and buried in the walls of the house long ago. Her clonish friends and she, three little quivering foos are locked in the closet until finally, Glenn faces the gigantic demonic creature who arises to dominate the planet along with the legions brought with him. Yet the secret is finally divulged in the method needed to destroy this foe, and so the prophesy is fulfilled.

It is a tongue in cheek horror movie starring a very young Stephen Dorff. There is a hole in his backyard which he and his friends try to cover but the hole gets bigger. After some minor thrills for the first 45 minutes the movie picks up when the monsters & demons are exposed, mostly small creatures wrecking havoc in Dorff's home. There is one huge creature toward the end that to me is awesome. Overall if you can get past the first 45 minutes you will have yourself a really good time enjoying the Gate as during that part of the movie,it appeared as if the director forgot it was a horror movie he was directing, not a Punky Brewster episodePreviously released from Platinum DVD as a full frame VHS quality DVD, Lionsgate has opened the Gate to a new widescreen transfer that  contain several bonus features such as an audio commentary, cast and crew interviews and much more. Special kudos to Michael Felsher who handled the bonus features for this DVD as well as the upcoming Night of the Creeps release.Before this release there was also a German widescreen release with features that were in German, so it was pretty useless (unless you understand German) so I for one am glad we are getting a holy grail for The Gate- as special as an edition that we will most likely getAbout the cover : the cover despite a little hokey is true to the movie with the boy and the little monsters. The boy is supposed to be Dorff but it didnt quite hit the mark, but to me it is acceptable. I did like the VHS cover sleeve way better but its available in a poster if you like the VHS artwork enough to want the poster.This is the kind of movie that shows what good effects,good acting and a small budget can achieve if you have a grand imagination ..",4,Open the Gate & you will find a good movie finally coming to DVD,1250294400,"08 15, 2009",2009,1840,"['Gate', 'one', 'fan', 'favorite', '80s', 'horror', 'movies', 'lines', 'Night', 'Creeps', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'horror', 'movie', 'starring', 'very', 'young', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'hole', 'backyard', 'friends', 'try', 'cover', 'hole', 'bigger', 'minor', 'thrills', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'movie', 'up', 'when', 'monsters', 'demons', 'are', 'exposed', 'mostly', 'small', 'creatures', 'wrecking', 'havoc', 'Dorff', 'home', 'one', 'huge', 'creature', 'end', 'awesome', 'Overall', 'can', 'get', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'will', 'have', 'really', 'good', 'time', 'enjoying', 'Gate', 'part', 'movie', 'appeared', 'director', 'forgot', 'was', 'horror', 'movie', 'was', 'directing', 'not', 'Punky', 'Brewster', 'episodePreviously', 'released', 'Platinum', 'DVD', 'full', 'frame', 'VHS', 'quality', 'DVD', 'Lionsgate', 'opened', 'Gate', 'new', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'several', 'bonus', 'features', 'such', 'audio', 'commentary', 'cast', 'crew', 'interviews', 'much', 'more', 'Special', 'kudos', 'Michael', 'Felsher', 'who', 'handled', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'upcoming', 'Night', 'Creeps', 'release.Before', 'release', 'was', 'also', 'German', 'widescreen', 'release', 'features', 'were', 'German', 'was', 'pretty', 'useless', 'understand', 'German', 'so', 'one', 'am', 'glad', 'are', 'getting', 'holy', 'grail', 'Gate-', 'as', 'special', 'edition', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'getAbout', 'cover', 'cover', 'little', 'hokey', 'true', 'movie', 'boy', 'little', 'monsters', 'boy', 'supposed', 'be', 'Dorff', 'quite', 'hit', 'mark', 'acceptable', 'did', 'VHS', 'cover', 'sleeve', 'way', 'better', 'available', 'poster', 'like', 'VHS', 'artwork', 'enough', 'want', 'poster.This', 'kind', 'movie', 'what', 'good', 'effects', 'good', 'acting', 'small', 'budget', 'can', 'achieve', 'have', 'grand', 'imagination', '..']",N/A

It's creepy and disturbing and most of us have feared some of the stuff that happens to the kids in this movie happening to us when we were kids.Having grown up on records, we often ran them backwards to try to hear secret backmasking messages in them - though we never actually did. Our basement was damp, dark and creepy - purely the turf of the washer, dryer and the furnace. My babysitter when I was young was often my older sister, and we made it a point to spook each other with games like ""Bloody Mary"" and attributing every little creak, crack and groan the house made in the night to something coming to get us.Back then, my young mind would turn the shapes of my coat rack, lamps and even my robe on the back of my door into menacing shadows that I was certain were monsters. Then there were the storage cabinets that took the place of the space normally under a bed. I was certain that more than once I heard a soft *snick* sound of one of them opening in the darkness. On more than one sleepover, my friends and I made attempts at contacting ""the other side"" with a cardboard ouija board with a plastic pointer sporting mole foam feet.The Gate plays on those fears nicely and I love the movie.So, why give it only 4 stars?

Things that aren't what they seem to be.Stephen Dorff plays the principle role in this film (however, I question the real date of this film because of him.

The story of the film is interesting enough : a lightnig strike in a kids backyard causes a gate to hell to open partially causing mysterious things to happen until it is opened fully. The effects in the film were pretty good (lots of claymation effects are used to create the spooky small demons and then the final big demon. For some reason old claymation effects like these still disturb me for some reason.) The movie is gorey in some parts but not so over the top to make you  sick to your stomach. Some examples are faces melting things biting skin and dead animal ect. The acting could have been somewhat better but for the genre the kids do an alright job. As for scenes that make you jump there are a couple. The one involving the main characters friend in the closet was my favorite though I will not go into to much detail for those who have not seen it. The editing in the film was one of the negitive things about it. The movie seemed sort of choppy in some places. Also one scene in the film was really bad. This scene involved to girls who are sleeping over the night the demons make their first appearance. After there encounter with them some local teenage guys come over and they seem to forget there experience with demons from hell and go party with the guys. This to me made no sense at all.

I like the movie's concept of an average suburban backyard being a hole straight to hell and a rock album that can actually summon demons, this movie does offer memorable moments like the eye in the hand and some gore for a PG-13 rating. It's a winner in my books that has a nice HP Lovecraft tone to it and spawned a sequel in 1992 with an upcoming 3D r-rated Remake in the works.This DVD is bareboned with a bad transfer and only in fullscreen with no trailer, but hopefully MGM will get the rights to 1 and 2 in a clean polished double feature in time for the new movie.Also recommended: ""Poltergeist"", ""Suspiria"", ""Silent Hill"", 1408"", ""Pet Sematary"", ""City of the Living Dead"", ""House By The Cemetery"", ""Hellraiser 1, 2, 3 and 4"", ""The Omen (1976)"", ""The Exorcist"", ""The Haunting in Conneticut"", ""Night of the Demons"", ""Event Horizon"", ""Gremlins"", ""The Fog (1980)"", ""Demons 1 & 2"", ""Urotsukidoji: Legend of the Overfiend"", ""Cat's Eye"", ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", ""Evil Dead 1 & 2"", ""Mirrors"", ""Burnt Offerings"", ""The Haunting (1963 and 1999)"", ""House (1986)"", ""Ghostbusters 1 & 2"", ""Twilight Zone The Movie"", ""Pumpkinhead"", ""Making Contact (a.k.a.

Well, I saw it at the theater when I was a teenager, being seduced by the special-effects in the TV ads (it really looked cool, and the thought of a hole that leads to hell was awesome!), but I remember leaving the theater thinking: &quot;Eh, it was okay.&quot;But then all these years later I'm flipping through cable late one night and saw the movie playing on TNT or TBS or something like that. I watched it and actually LOVED it more this time around than at the theater.I think nostalgia was a big factor. The movie oozes with 80's atmosphere, especially the girls and the little &quot;party&quot; they have at the house.

Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 1]","When I was looking for some inspiration for a plot involving little monsters attacking people, I had several movies to choose from. The ""little monsters attack"" horror/comedy genre was a fad that started with Gremlins and continued on through Critters, Ghoulies, and Troll in the eighties, among others. I was looking for more horror, less comedy.  You need look no further than The Gate.The Gate's concept is straightforward horror: kids alone (Stephen Dorf as preteen Glen and Christa Denton as his big sister Al) at home inadvertently open a literal pit to the netherworld and all hell breaks loose.  But that's oversimplifying the movie, because there's so much more here.Despite its PG-13 rating, The Gate is rather disturbing. Two of the kids are kidnapped by demons, a dead dog is involved, and a parent's head explodes. At one point Al grabs her father's gun and fires it (!) at one of the monsters. Glen's friend Terry (Louis Tripp) comes back as a demon to bite our protagonist, who proceeds to poke out his eye with a Barbie doll's leg.  There's no way this movie would get a PG-13 rating today!Then there are the little demons themselves, who seem like every kid's nightmare.  The director knew how to use ""bigatures"" to his advantage (a technique perfected in Lord of the Rings), giving the demons a disturbingly lifelike appearance since they're actually actors in suits on a larger backdrop.  There are other great FX too, not the least of which is a zombie exploding into a swarm of little demons. And to the movie's credit, artwork seen early in the movie depicts the demon lord accurately - the stop-motion demon that shows up at the end is every bit as horrifying.Although this is a kid's movie, The Gate pushes all the buttons kids are afraid of. The demons prevent the kids from calling their parents (shouting, ""YOU'VE BEEN BAAAD!""). The dead dog shows up in the most frightening places.  And long, clawed arms snake out underneath beds to grab at the unsuspecting.  If this movie doesn't give kids nightmares, nothing will.The movie is hopelessly mired in the eighties.  The teens dressed with ridiculous big hairstyles. The next door neighbor Terry (Louis Tripp) learns how to repel the demons by playing his death metal record backwards. And the dialogue is hopeless: ""Suck my nose until my head caves in,"" is Glen's taunt to one of Al's annoying friends.But that's beside the point.  This is a movie about a kid's love for his big sister and rockets, both of which help him overcome the forces of evil. With special effects ahead of its time, demons that are anything but cute, and a climax that is both terrifying and inspirational, The Gate is an entertaining piece of eighties horror history. After the hell poor Glen goes through, he deserves the sappy happy ending.",4,Great Gate,1209859200,"05 4, 2008",2008,2796,"['When', 'was', 'looking', 'inspiration', 'plot', 'involving', 'little', 'monsters', 'attacking', 'people', 'had', 'several', 'movies', 'choose', 'little', 'monsters', 'attack', 'horror/comedy', 'genre', 'was', 'fad', 'started', 'Gremlins', 'continued', 'Critters', 'Ghoulies', 'Troll', 'eighties', 'others', 'was', 'looking', 'more', 'horror', 'less', 'comedy', 'need', 'look', 'further', 'Gate.The', 'Gate', 'concept', 'straightforward', 'horror', 'kids', 'alone', 'Stephen', 'Dorf', 'preteen', 'Glen', 'Christa', 'Denton', 'big', 'sister', 'Al', 'home', 'inadvertently', 'open', 'literal', 'pit', 'netherworld', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'oversimplifying', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'here.Despite', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'Gate', 'rather', 'disturbing', 'Two', 'kids', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'demons', 'dead', 'dog', 'involved', 'parent', 'head', 'explodes', 'one', 'point', 'Al', 'father', 'gun', 'one', 'monsters', 'Glen', 'friend', 'Terry', 'Louis', 'Tripp', 'back', 'demon', 'bite', 'protagonist', 'who', 'poke', 'out', 'eye', 'Barbie', 'doll', 'leg', 'way', 'movie', 'would', 'get', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'today', 'Then', 'are', 'little', 'demons', 'who', 'seem', 'kid', 'nightmare', 'director', 'knew', 'how', 'use', 'bigatures', 'advantage', 'technique', 'perfected', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'giving', 'demons', 'disturbingly', 'lifelike', 'appearance', ""'re"", 'actually', 'actors', 'suits', 'larger', 'backdrop', 'are', 'other', 'great', 'FX', 'too', 'not', 'least', 'zombie', 'exploding', 'swarm', 'little', 'demons', 'movie', 'credit', 'artwork', 'seen', 'early', 'movie', 'demon', 'lord', 'accurately', 'stop-motion', 'demon', 'up', 'end', 'bit', 'horrifying.Although', 'kid', 'movie', 'Gate', 'pushes', 'buttons', 'kids', 'are', 'afraid', 'demons', 'prevent', 'kids', 'calling', 'parents', 'shouting', ""'VE"", 'BEEN', 'BAAAD', 'dead', 'dog', 'up', 'most', 'frightening', 'places', 'long', 'clawed', 'arms', 'snake', 'out', 'underneath', 'beds', 'grab', 'unsuspecting', 'movie', ""n't"", 'give', 'kids', 'nightmares', 'nothing', 'will.The', 'movie', 'hopelessly', 'mired', 'eighties', 'teens', 'dressed', 'ridiculous', 'big', 'hairstyles', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'Terry', 'Louis', 'Tripp', 'how', 'repel', 'demons', 'playing', 'death', 'metal', 'record', 'backwards', 'dialogue', 'hopeless', 'Suck', 'nose', 'head', 'caves', 'Glen', 'taunt', 'one', 'Al', 'annoying', 'friends.But', 'point', 'movie', 'kid', 'love', 'big', 'sister', 'rockets', 'help', 'overcome', 'forces', 'evil', 'special', 'effects', 'ahead', 'time', 'demons', 'are', 'anything', 'cute', 'climax', 'terrifying', 'inspirational', 'Gate', 'entertaining', 'piece', 'eighties', 'horror', 'history', 'hell', 'poor', 'Glen', 'sappy', 'happy', 'ending']",N/A
292847,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,6302038286,Micheal Hunt,"[1, 3]","The Gate is a 1988 kids horror movie, aimed at 10 to 14 year olds. When I saw the trailer to this recently, I thought the effects of it looked kinda cool, but when you see it in the movie and not just a few glimpses, they are not all that impressive. The story is about a kid who he and his friend go digging in the backyard and stumble upon a hole that they work out is a gateway to hell, they find all their information in a devils guide that just happened to be printed on the best-friends favorite record (LP) (those old black giant CD lookin' things)... while the parents are away, the demons will play, and the kids go on the typical adventure of nobody believes them, until it's too late.I can't see this one being as popular as something along the lines of ""Goonies"" or ""Monster Squad"" but it has it's memorable moments. I think what holds this movie back from being much greater is the end scenes of the movie just drag on and on and on... I get that they where going for an ending that when you think it's over, it's not, but I got quite restless when you see what plays out and how ridicules it seems. I'm not sure if they wanted to go for something with scary monsters, but little clay animation trolls with blank expressions made me chuckle at how silly the whole thing looked. But there are some other decent effects that made me think, if this was to be remade, and with some better modern day special effects, the concept of what they did in this movie could be made better... provided they don't go overkill. For once I think this movie would actually benefit from having the Star Wars treatment done to it, and replace whats in this movie's clay, stop motion effects with ILM CGI... then it might not look so silly... but then again, the ending would still be the same.There are a few scenes I wondered if a kid under 13 should see? Like exploding heads and oozing eyeballs etc.. but then again, if they tried to give this an M or R rating, they would have been the laughing stock of 1988.It's decent, rent it if you can, or pick it up reasonably cheap, but it's not really something I could see too many people watching again and again anytime soon after the first viewing. Maybe those who where around when the movie came out would purchase it for nostalgia value, but it isn't really that good of a movie even to them when you honestly think about it.",3,All hell is breaking lose in his backyard.,1308614400,"06 21, 2011",2011,2372,"['Gate', '1988', 'kids', 'horror', 'movie', 'aimed', '10', '14', 'year', 'olds', 'When', 'saw', 'trailer', 'recently', 'thought', 'effects', 'looked', 'kinda', 'cool', 'when', 'see', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'few', 'glimpses', 'are', 'not', 'impressive', 'story', 'kid', 'who', 'friend', 'go', 'digging', 'backyard', 'stumble', 'hole', 'work', 'out', 'gateway', 'hell', 'find', 'information', 'devils', 'guide', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'printed', 'best-friends', 'favorite', 'record', 'LP', 'old', 'black', 'giant', 'CD', 'lookin', 'things', 'parents', 'are', 'away', 'demons', 'will', 'play', 'kids', 'go', 'typical', 'adventure', 'nobody', 'too', 'late.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'one', 'being', 'as', 'popular', 'something', 'lines', 'Goonies', 'Monster', 'Squad', 'memorable', 'moments', 'think', 'what', 'movie', 'back', 'being', 'much', 'greater', 'end', 'scenes', 'movie', 'just', 'drag', 'get', 'where', 'going', 'ending', 'when', 'think', 'not', 'got', 'quite', 'restless', 'when', 'see', 'what', 'out', 'how', 'ridicules', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'wanted', 'go', 'something', 'scary', 'monsters', 'little', 'clay', 'animation', 'trolls', 'blank', 'expressions', 'made', 'chuckle', 'how', 'silly', 'whole', 'thing', 'looked', 'are', 'other', 'decent', 'effects', 'made', 'think', 'was', 'be', 'remade', 'better', 'modern', 'day', 'special', 'effects', 'concept', 'what', 'did', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'better', 'provided', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'overkill', 'once', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'actually', 'benefit', 'having', 'Star', 'Wars', 'treatment', 'done', 'replace', 'whats', 'movie', 'clay', 'stop', 'motion', 'effects', 'ILM', 'CGI', 'then', 'might', 'not', 'look', 'so', 'silly', 'then', 'again', 'ending', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'same.There', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'wondered', 'kid', '13', 'should', 'see', 'exploding', 'heads', 'oozing', 'eyeballs', 'etc..', 'then', 'again', 'tried', 'give', 'M', 'R', 'rating', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'laughing', 'stock', '1988.It', 'decent', 'rent', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'reasonably', 'cheap', 'not', 'really', 'something', 'could', 'see', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'watching', 'again', 'again', 'anytime', 'soon', 'first', 'viewing', 'Maybe', 'who', 'where', 'around', 'when', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'would', 'purchase', 'nostalgia', 'value', ""n't"", 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'even', 'when', 'honestly', 'think']",N/A

As Glen and Terry are left in the care of Glen's teenage big sister, ""Al"", for three days time, small demonic creatures begin to wreak havoc on the trio, terrorizing not only them, but their occasional teenage visitors as well. It's up to Glen, Terry, and Al to find a way to close up the hole and stop the demonic forces from spreading, but how?If you grew up in the 80's and 90's and love horror films, you're probably familiar with ""The Gate"". Released in 1987 and directed by Tibor Takacs, this is one that most of us rented at some point or another, and if we were young enough, it might have freaked us out. It's actually something of a kids' horror film. Sort of Goonies meets Evil Dead, or something like that. Think ""Monster Squad"", but more about demons than classic movie monsters. But be warned, this is an '80's kids' movie, back when kids' movies were actually good because they went more for believability over political correctness and fear of traumatizing viewers. These days, PIXAR aside, movies and television are getting very viewer age specific again, so that it is hard for people of varying ages to enjoy the same entertainment together. That's not the way it was in the '80's, when a lot of the kids' stuff was entertaining for adults too. So, basically, keep in mind that there is some scary stuff in here, for some kids anyway, and like I said, this deals with demons, a touchy subject for some people to see in a kids' movie. It also covers all the basics. We see a teen party that includes some playing of ""Light as a Feather, Stiff as a Board"", a kid listening to the kind of rock albums some parents burned back then, and other misbehaving in general, some of this leading to the demon infestation that takes place. But, it's those little, realistic, nostalgic touches that make this so good, like kids acting believably and doing things kids really do, or did back then anyway. This realism really brings the creepy, less realistic fantasy elements home. The young actors are excellent. In the lead, we have a very young Stephen Dorff who really shows his skills here. Louis Tripp is also great as troubled Terry, and I always had a thing for the lovely Christa Denton who played big sister Al and did a great job of it. The effects are fantastic too! Taking lessons from a huge fave of mine, ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"", the effects in this small budget movie are highly impressive and sufficiently creepy! Bottom line, if you don't require a lot of gore or violence and if you love `80's horror like Night of the Demons, Evil Dead, Ghoulies, Critters, and more family friendly stuff like Monster Squad and Gremlins, you should love this too! It's just great stuff!The DVD is excellent too. It features a widescreen presentation, trailer, retrospective featurettes, and a commentary by the director, writer, and special effects creator. The only disappointing aspect (aside from the fact that I don't think that's Dorff on the seemingly recently created cover art) is the lack of participation by the cast on any of the bonus material. It would have been neat to hear from them and see them today. Anyway, great film, love finally owning it on DVD, and I highly recommend it if you are into this sort of thing.",5,Goonies Meets Evil Dead,1278547200,"07 8, 2010",2010,3409,"['When', '11-year-old', 'Glen', 'best', 'friend', 'Terry', 'unintentionally', 'open', 'supernatural', 'gateway', 'digging', 'backyard', 'hell', 'literally', 'loose', 'Glen', 'Terry', 'are', 'left', 'care', 'Glen', 'teenage', 'big', 'sister', 'Al', 'three', 'days', 'time', 'small', 'demonic', 'creatures', 'begin', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'trio', 'terrorizing', 'not', 'only', 'occasional', 'teenage', 'visitors', 'as', 'well', 'up', 'Glen', 'Terry', 'Al', 'find', 'way', 'close', 'up', 'hole', 'stop', 'demonic', 'forces', 'spreading', 'how', 'grew', 'up', '80', '90', 'love', 'horror', 'films', ""'re"", 'probably', 'familiar', 'Gate', 'Released', '1987', 'directed', 'Tibor', 'Takacs', 'one', 'most', 'rented', 'point', 'were', 'young', 'enough', 'might', 'have', 'freaked', 'out', 'actually', 'something', 'kids', 'horror', 'film', 'Sort', 'Goonies', 'meets', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'something', 'Think', 'Monster', 'Squad', 'more', 'demons', 'classic', 'movie', 'monsters', 'be', 'warned', ""'80"", 'kids', 'movie', 'back', 'when', 'kids', 'movies', 'were', 'actually', 'good', 'went', 'more', 'believability', 'political', 'correctness', 'fear', 'traumatizing', 'viewers', 'days', 'PIXAR', 'aside', 'movies', 'television', 'are', 'getting', 'very', 'viewer', 'age', 'specific', 'again', 'hard', 'people', 'varying', 'ages', 'enjoy', 'same', 'entertainment', 'together', 'not', 'way', 'was', ""'80"", 'when', 'lot', 'kids', 'stuff', 'was', 'entertaining', 'adults', 'too', 'So', 'basically', 'keep', 'mind', 'scary', 'stuff', 'here', 'kids', 'anyway', 'said', 'demons', 'touchy', 'subject', 'people', 'see', 'kids', 'movie', 'also', 'basics', 'see', 'teen', 'party', 'playing', 'Light', 'Feather', 'Stiff', 'Board', 'kid', 'listening', 'kind', 'rock', 'albums', 'parents', 'burned', 'back', 'then', 'other', 'misbehaving', 'general', 'leading', 'demon', 'infestation', 'place', 'little', 'realistic', 'nostalgic', 'touches', 'make', 'so', 'good', 'kids', 'acting', 'believably', 'doing', 'things', 'kids', 'really', 'do', 'did', 'back', 'then', 'anyway', 'realism', 'really', 'creepy', 'less', 'realistic', 'fantasy', 'elements', 'home', 'young', 'actors', 'are', 'excellent', 'lead', 'have', 'very', 'young', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'who', 'really', 'skills', 'here', 'Louis', 'Tripp', 'also', 'great', 'troubled', 'Terry', 'always', 'had', 'thing', 'lovely', 'Christa', 'Denton', 'who', 'played', 'big', 'sister', 'Al', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'effects', 'are', 'fantastic', 'too', 'Taking', 'lessons', 'huge', 'fave', 'mine', 'Darby', ""O'Gill"", 'Little', 'People', 'effects', 'small', 'budget', 'movie', 'are', 'highly', 'impressive', 'sufficiently', 'creepy', 'Bottom', 'line', 'do', ""n't"", 'require', 'lot', 'gore', 'violence', 'love', '80', 'horror', 'Night', 'Demons', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'Ghoulies', 'Critters', 'more', 'family', 'friendly', 'Monster', 'Squad', 'Gremlins', 'should', 'love', 'too', 'just', 'great', 'stuff', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'too', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'trailer', 'retrospective', 'featurettes', 'commentary', 'director', 'writer', 'special', 'effects', 'creator', 'only', 'disappointing', 'aspect', 'aside', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Dorff', 'seemingly', 'recently', 'created', 'cover', 'art', 'lack', 'participation', 'cast', 'bonus', 'material', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'neat', 'hear', 'see', 'today', 'Anyway', 'great', 'film', 'love', 'finally', 'owning', 'DVD', 'highly', 'recommend', 'are', 'sort', 'thing']",N/A

I haven't seen this film in over 15 years, but when I did see it, I saw it MANY times.  I recently watched it again to see if it was as fun as I remember.  Usually watching a movie years later that you loved as a kid is a bad move coz you tend to be disappointed.  After all, through the eyes of a child you don't look for or hang on to the inaccuracies.  You're able to accept a premise no matter how far fetched, and acting no matter how bad.  While I saw a bit of both, I was pleasantly surprised that the movie still retained all of it's fun factor.  I still really like it!  I'm gonna give you a quick rundown regardless of what the schmuck below says:  Glen(a very young Stephen Dorff), and his teenage sister are left alone to mind the house while mommy and daddy are gone.  After a storm, they discover a big hole in the backyard that we quickly find out is a gateway for demons to come through and take over the world.  We find this out coz Glen's buddy Terry, who lives next door, just happens to have an LP by a metal band called Sacrifyx(only available as an import by the way).  Sacrifyx's album sleeve and lyrics tell the whole tale.  Thank God for 80s metal albums and their spookish shenanigans, you never know when they'll come in handy(this film was obviously made in the period where listening to a heavy metal band was seen as only one step away from blood orgies and human sacrifice.  Thanks Geraldo for jamming that point home!).  Soon Glen, his sister, and Terry(not to mention two annoying friends of the sister) deal with various spooks and beasties in an effort to close the gate.  The most memorable creatures being the mini-demons that scuttle around and bite you if they get close enough.  While obviously silly(I won't give it away in case you forgot, but the way the demons are defeated and the gate gets closed is rather dumb and makes no real sense), and not terribly frightening, this movie is actually very entertaining.  This was back when a PG-13 rated horror film could still have balls and a decent amount of gore.  The whole mythology of the demons is pure Lovecraft.  Those familiar with Lovecraft will notice this immediately with the whole concept of older gods who once ruled the earth that want to return and reclaim it.  Considering the low budget and nonexistence of CGI, most of the miniature effects for the small demons look quite impressive today.  The large demon, while obviously stop motion animation, looks kinda creepy.  At one point Glen discovers he has a living eyeball in the palm of his hand, and it makes you wonder if Faith No More stole something from this movie.  Of course the acting isn't all fantastic, not all the fx are perfect, and some of the plot points are ridiculous, but who cares?  We don't expect it to be perfect.  Add to all that, a Masters of the Universe shirt, Iron Maiden and Slayer posters, and you've got a great trip down memory lane.  If it's been a while, I'd make it a point to see this one again soon.",4,"Ah, Memories....",1192838400,"10 20, 2007",2007,3064,"['What', 'horror', 'fan', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'movie', 'HBO', 'USA', 'back', 'day', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', '15', 'years', 'when', 'did', 'see', 'saw', 'MANY', 'times', 'recently', 'watched', 'again', 'see', 'was', 'as', 'fun', 'remember', 'Usually', 'watching', 'movie', 'years', 'later', 'loved', 'kid', 'bad', 'move', 'coz', 'tend', 'be', 'disappointed', 'eyes', 'child', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'hang', 'inaccuracies', ""'re"", 'able', 'accept', 'premise', 'matter', 'how', 'far', 'fetched', 'acting', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'saw', 'bit', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'movie', 'still', 'retained', 'fun', 'factor', 'still', 'really', ""'m"", 'gon', 'give', 'quick', 'rundown', 'regardless', 'what', 'schmuck', 'Glen', 'very', 'young', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'teenage', 'sister', 'are', 'left', 'alone', 'mind', 'house', 'mommy', 'daddy', 'are', 'gone', 'storm', 'discover', 'big', 'hole', 'backyard', 'quickly', 'find', 'out', 'gateway', 'demons', 'come', 'take', 'world', 'find', 'out', 'coz', 'Glen', 'buddy', 'Terry', 'who', 'next', 'door', 'just', 'have', 'LP', 'metal', 'band', 'called', 'Sacrifyx', 'only', 'available', 'import', 'way', 'Sacrifyx', 'album', 'sleeve', 'lyrics', 'tell', 'whole', 'tale', 'Thank', 'God', '80s', 'metal', 'albums', 'spookish', 'shenanigans', 'never', 'know', 'when', ""'ll"", 'come', 'handy', 'film', 'was', 'obviously', 'made', 'period', 'where', 'listening', 'heavy', 'metal', 'band', 'was', 'seen', 'only', 'one', 'step', 'away', 'blood', 'orgies', 'human', 'sacrifice', 'Thanks', 'Geraldo', 'jamming', 'point', 'home', 'Soon', 'Glen', 'sister', 'Terry', 'not', 'mention', 'two', 'annoying', 'friends', 'sister', 'deal', 'various', 'spooks', 'beasties', 'effort', 'close', 'gate', 'most', 'memorable', 'creatures', 'being', 'mini-demons', 'scuttle', 'around', 'bite', 'get', 'close', 'enough', 'obviously', 'silly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'case', 'forgot', 'way', 'demons', 'are', 'defeated', 'gate', 'closed', 'rather', 'dumb', 'real', 'sense', 'not', 'terribly', 'frightening', 'movie', 'actually', 'very', 'entertaining', 'was', 'back', 'when', 'PG-13', 'rated', 'horror', 'film', 'could', 'still', 'have', 'balls', 'decent', 'amount', 'gore', 'whole', 'mythology', 'demons', 'pure', 'Lovecraft', 'familiar', 'Lovecraft', 'will', 'notice', 'immediately', 'whole', 'concept', 'older', 'gods', 'who', 'once', 'ruled', 'earth', 'want', 'return', 'reclaim', 'Considering', 'low', 'budget', 'nonexistence', 'CGI', 'most', 'miniature', 'effects', 'small', 'demons', 'look', 'quite', 'impressive', 'today', 'large', 'demon', 'obviously', 'stop', 'motion', 'animation', 'kinda', 'creepy', 'one', 'point', 'Glen', 'living', 'eyeball', 'palm', 'hand', 'wonder', 'Faith', 'No', 'More', 'stole', 'something', 'movie', 'course', 'acting', ""n't"", 'fantastic', 'not', 'fx', 'are', 'perfect', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'perfect', 'Add', 'Masters', 'Universe', 'shirt', 'Iron', 'Maiden', 'Slayer', 'posters', ""'ve"", 'got', 'great', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'been', 'while', ""'d"", 'make', 'point', 'see', 'one', 'again', 'soon']",N/A

A worthless first half is thankfully redeemed by some very impressive special effects in the second half and a terrific sense of atmosphere endures throughout. It's an old film (circa 1987) but The Gate still holds up well and is worth a look. Of particular interest is the fact that this is Stephen Dorff's first film role...and one of the better creature features of the 1980's. It's definitely what 80's 'B' grade horror is all about...heroic kids in way over their heads and going toe to toe with apocalyptic evil. Man...it's so horror nostalgic it brings a tear of joy to my eye, but the thing that made this particular movie great was it's emphasis on subtle creepiness rather that just straight out shocks and gore...and whilst some of the acting, clothes and hairdos leave a lot to be desired (hey...we're talkin' the 80's here kids) it's so much darn FUN to watch...even today. Now don't get me wrong...this film is as cheezy as they come and all you 'Freddy vs. Jason' fed youngsters out there will probably think that it's lame...but for us gen 'Xers' this is cult- classic gold. And, man...was that girl Alexandra HOT or WHAT?! Raaghrr!By the way if you're a fan of this film you may want to keep your eyes open for the 3D remake that is apparently on it's way to a cinema near you!

I was always excited to see it as a kid, and was pretty happy to find it on DVD. The DVD isn't the best quality, but I didn't expect some 2 disc ultra-edition for an 80's cult classic. I would have bought it, but I'm not sure people seeing it for the first time would take such a chance. There are so many memorable parts in this movie, it's hard to pick out the key scenes. I love the opening, vey eerie, and you're never sure whether it was a dream, real, or somewhere in between. The whole party scene, when Terry falls down the hole, and when the zombie breaks through and carries away his best friend and sister. Oh, and who can forget the rock record taht tells how to close the gate when it's played backward.

Although I remembered it different then it was from when I watched it again last year, it doesn't matter. It was still just as good. There are three main kids a brother,a sister,and the brothers friend. Now the brothers friend is into shall we say &quot;Satanic music&quot;, so he recites something from one of the songs and it opens the gate of hell in his friends front yard while his friends parents are away for the weekend. This is only PG-13, but it still has some good scares. And one of the few good horror flicks to come out of the 1980's. Its entertaining and it contains no sexual content or crap like that so its pretty enjoyable. To find out more go out and and rent it, I'm not garunteeing that you like it, but if you like horror movies chances are you will like this one.God Bless ~Amy",5,Not a bad horrow movie,1000080000,"09 10, 2001",2001,921,"['child', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'used', 'watch', 'time', 'Yes', 'child', 'was', '4yrs', 'loved', 'remembered', 'different', 'then', 'was', 'when', 'watched', 'again', 'last', 'year', ""n't"", 'matter', 'was', 'still', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'are', 'three', 'main', 'kids', 'brother', 'sister', 'brothers', 'friend', 'Now', 'brothers', 'friend', 'shall', 'say', 'quot', 'Satanic', 'music', 'quot', 'something', 'one', 'songs', 'gate', 'hell', 'friends', 'front', 'yard', 'friends', 'parents', 'are', 'away', 'weekend', 'only', 'PG-13', 'still', 'good', 'scares', 'one', 'few', 'good', 'horror', 'flicks', 'come', '1980', 'entertaining', 'sexual', 'content', 'crap', 'so', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'go', 'rent', ""'m"", 'not', 'garunteeing', 'like', 'horror', 'movies', 'chances', 'are', 'will', 'like', 'one.God', 'Bless', '~Amy']",N/A

Young Stephen Dorff and his best friend accidentally open the gates of hell in their back yard and all hell breaks loose!! Now, their home is haunted by miniature ugly demons, zombies, monster, black magik, ghosts and Satan itself and the only way to stop evil from taking the world is by following the rules Metal!!!! the only way to save the world is by playing a satanic metal record backward and follow the rules. I first saw this movie almost 15 years ago, I was 12 and thought it was the coolest movie ever, now  I'm 27 and some very cool memories were brought back...even dough it wasn't what I expected some very cool stuff still there. The Gate is not the best movie b-movie ever made, it's very far from it, but is not bad at all, I find it very cool and entertaining even if it has some very ugly and cheesy 80's fashion, dialogue and synth music, but what else could you expect from an 80's low budget B- movie. So give it a try and you will find a very entertaining flick with some very cool fx.
