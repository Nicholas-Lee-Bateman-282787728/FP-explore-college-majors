The title of the movie says it all. An aborigine is falsely accused of murder and he runs knowing he will not be believed. He and the Tracker have more in common that the Tracker has with the men that hired him.. There are light moments as well as the more serious aspect to it. It also had a surprise ending which made the entire movie worth watching. The actors were great although I only recognized one and he will be remembered from the last Indiana Jones movie...It is a great family movie and should be watched just for the history lesson.

A tremendous story shot amongst some of the most spectactular scenery one could ever imagine. IF New Zealand weren't such a liberal hell hole I would love to live there just to sit on the porch and look. It is probably against the law to sit outside in New Zealand however as the government there probably takes the view that the public display of the evil old human being is bad for the environment. Good thing this movie was set before the New Zealander Government went completely mad though.Unusual to see the New Zealander home guard still using the Martini Henri rifle during the period so displayed. I would have thought that the Enfield would have been in use by then...probably my mistake and I am aware that the Martini rifle did remain in partial use until well into the early part of the 20th Century...don't know why I even thought about that much less mentioned it.Back to the point.

Christensen,"[9, 9]","Having just watched this movie and reading all the reviews, I felt the need to add my own.Most people seem to cover the plot adequately but completely miss the point of what is trulygoing on here.  Ray Winstone plays a displaced South African who lost everything in the Boer War.Temuera Morrison plays a native New Zealand Maori who has witnessed the demise of his family andculture to the British Empire as well.  While the plot is about the one man tracking the other inthe beautiful New Zealand countryside, the movie is really about these two men finding themselvesagain.  Morrison left New Zealand at a young age and has returned for a reason.  Winstone has losthome and family and is looking for his own salvation.  While on the surface, the movie is the ploddingtracking of an accused criminal, it is really the story of these two men finding redemptionin their own lives ... and just a little bit of payback to the Empire thrown in for fun.  This is nota movie to sleep your way through, you need to pay attention to the back stories of these two charactersto truly understand their actions.  The movie is rated R for some blood and guts, but this is a storywritten by someone who knows something about life and the human condition.

I wish I had known this was a foreign ""western"" with English and New Zealand accented actors. I could catch perhaps 3 out of 10 words. If it's one thing I hate it's not being able to understand the dialog. While on that subject, the sound management of this movie is just horrible. I found myself chasing the volume up & down either trying to hear what was being said or trying not to be deafened. The filmography was obviously shot in several different formats. Some scenes were exceptionally bright & clear, while others may have well been shot with a camera phone. I couldn't finish the movie. When the Boer sat down with the Maori feeding him & talking with him, their whispering, dialect & the crappy sound together were more than I could bear anymore. Since I knew this was an important scene given the timing, that really pissed me off.

1441976,A3RMEU4GNP60BM,B0054PSY54,"Sussman ""Sussman""","[5, 5]","First a brief summary of the plot, the beginning of the film we see Arajan (aka Ray Winstone), an Afrikaner and veteran of the Boer War (two wars fought between the British Empire and the two independent Boer republics in Southern Africa) who has just arrived in New Zealand. From the ships roster his name is recognised by British veteran of the Boer war Major Carlyle who wants to meet him. Arajan was a guerrilla fighter and master tracker. Next we meet Kereamea (Morrison) a M'ori seafarer, who through no fault of his own is forced into an altercation with some soldiers, during the fight one of soldier's accidently kills a colleague but blames it on Kereama.Major Carlyle enlists and promises Arajan a bounty to capture Kereama who is accused of killing the soldier.Arajan catches up with Kereamea, who protests his innocence, but repeatedly escapes and is recaptured. Arajan and Kereamea get to know each other and a bonding of sorts occurs they then respect each other, and there is a showdown with British troops led by Major Carlyle. The outline of the plot kept brief so as not spoil. The landscapes and wilderness are breath taking, and fare amount of effort is made to make it look like the early 1900s. You need to pay attention to Ray Winston's characters back story as it is important, and leads to a much better understanding who he is and why he does what he does.There are a small number of rather negative reviews about the film and while some aspects of the criticism levelled and have some slight merit, this film is rather good. This is not Sexy Beast or harsh east end London film and yes Ray Winston's accent is slightly poor, although it's not that bad.

1441978,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B0054PSY54,Tommy Dooley,"[25, 26]","This film is set in 1903, Ray Winstone plays a Boer War veteran Arjan Van Diemen. The Boer War was the first time Colonial troops from New Zealand fought with the British. Part of that campaign included the burning of farms, a scorched earth policy and the herding of Boer families into the first `concentration camps'. Arjan has lost everything and like some of his former comrades, when the New Zealanders return home he went with them.On arrival he is picked up by the authorities, as he was a notorious Boer guerrilla fighter. He is quickly released, and then a turn of events causes the British to commission him for help. That comes in the form of a Maori whaler, who after jumping ship gets caught in a compromising position with a lady of the night, and the drunken soldiers decide to teach `the savage' a lesson. In the ensuing fight one of them is killed, Kereama (Temuera Morrison) does a runner - as he knows he will be blamed.Mr Winstone is then engaged to track him down. The film then takes us on a tour of the beautiful landscape of New Zealand, it is wonderful cinematography and the direction is superb from Ian Sharp. The plot is one of cat and mouse and the more that the two men discover about each other; the more they find they have in common. They trade passages from the scriptures in a psychological game to out do each other. This is not an action movie, but a drama/thriller according to the box, it is also a story of the human spirit. Ray Winstone does a really good job and this is despite being well outside his normal `comfort zone' of the cockney gangster type. His accent sounds pretty good too. There is some obvious sign posting to plot development, but that does not spoil things.A quick word on the 'editorial review' above, it is factually wrong and should be taken with a pinch of salt - industrial grade.What I really like is the balanced approach that is taken to the historical setting, and not all the Brits are cardboard cut out caricatures - which is refreshing. Part funded by the UK Film Council, this is another example why it should maintain its' funding, a great little gem of a film, that I can only recommend.",4,"'He Must trap the enemy, to set them both free' - Movie tag line",1309651200,"07 3, 2011",2011,2163,"['film', 'set', '1903', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'Boer', 'War', 'veteran', 'Arjan', 'Van', 'Diemen', 'Boer', 'War', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'Colonial', 'troops', 'New', 'Zealand', 'fought', 'British', 'Part', 'campaign', 'included', 'burning', 'farms', 'scorched', 'earth', 'policy', 'herding', 'Boer', 'families', 'first', 'concentration', 'camps', 'Arjan', 'lost', 'everything', 'former', 'comrades', 'when', 'New', 'Zealanders', 'return', 'home', 'went', 'them.On', 'arrival', 'picked', 'up', 'authorities', 'was', 'notorious', 'Boer', 'guerrilla', 'fighter', 'quickly', 'released', 'then', 'turn', 'events', 'British', 'commission', 'help', 'form', 'Maori', 'whaler', 'who', 'jumping', 'ship', 'caught', 'compromising', 'position', 'lady', 'night', 'drunken', 'soldiers', 'decide', 'teach', 'savage', 'lesson', 'ensuing', 'fight', 'one', 'killed', 'Kereama', 'Temuera', 'Morrison', 'runner', 'will', 'be', 'blamed.Mr', 'Winstone', 'then', 'engaged', 'track', 'down', 'film', 'then', 'tour', 'beautiful', 'landscape', 'New', 'Zealand', 'wonderful', 'cinematography', 'direction', 'superb', 'Ian', 'Sharp', 'plot', 'one', 'cat', 'mouse', 'more', 'two', 'men', 'discover', 'other', 'more', 'find', 'have', 'common', 'trade', 'passages', 'scriptures', 'psychological', 'game', 'out', 'do', 'other', 'not', 'action', 'movie', 'drama/thriller', 'according', 'box', 'also', 'story', 'human', 'spirit', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'being', 'well', 'normal', 'comfort', 'zone', 'cockney', 'gangster', 'type', 'accent', 'sounds', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'obvious', 'sign', 'posting', 'plot', 'development', 'not', 'spoil', 'things.A', 'quick', 'word', ""'editorial"", 'review', 'factually', 'wrong', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'pinch', 'salt', 'industrial', 'grade.What', 'really', 'like', 'balanced', 'approach', 'taken', 'historical', 'setting', 'not', 'Brits', 'are', 'cardboard', 'cut', 'out', 'caricatures', 'refreshing', 'Part', 'funded', 'UK', 'Film', 'Council', 'example', 'why', 'should', 'maintain', 'funding', 'great', 'little', 'gem', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'recommend']",Tracker
