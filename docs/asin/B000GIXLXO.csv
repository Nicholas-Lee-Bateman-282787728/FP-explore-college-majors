Examining his career from the start up until the 2006 season, it seems like a version 2.0 of this DVD will be required to show him breaking the all-time passing yards and touchdowns records, along with his incredible MVP-type 2007 season.  If you are a Brett Favre and/or Packers fan and enjoy watching NFL documentaries, you will no doubt enjoy this solid release!!**** RECOMMENDED",4,The Riverboat Gambler,1202342400,"02 7, 2008",2008,483,"['4', 'Ever', 'great', 'look', 'one', 'most', 'storied', 'quarterbacks', 'NFL', 'history', 'Brett', 'Favre', 'Examining', 'career', 'start', '2006', 'season', 'version', '2.0', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'required', 'show', 'breaking', 'all-time', 'passing', 'yards', 'touchdowns', 'records', 'incredible', 'MVP-type', '2007', 'season', 'are', 'Brett', 'Favre', 'Packers', 'fan', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'NFL', 'documentaries', 'will', 'doubt', 'enjoy', 'solid', 'release', '****', 'RECOMMENDED']",NFL: Favre 4 Ever

1005009,A1O3Y87VCQ8JAI,B000GIXLXO,"Jane Austin ""Rebecca""","[0, 0]","I have watched this repeatedly and think this dvd is very well made. It is liking watching poetry in motion when Brett throws, and you will get tears in your eyes watching the segment on when his father passed away and how he played that game, perhaps his best ever. Why is Brett Favre so adored? He may be known as the ""gunslinger"" but he is also all heart and plays football with the passion and enthusiasm his fans admire him for. I think that Billy Bob Thorton narrating this dvd was the icing on the cake.

It has some cool footage from high school and college that you never see anywhere else.  It also has some stories that you've never heard before.  It's a great movie and during the part about Brett and his dad, wow, it made me want to cry!  It pumped me up for the game this weekend, that's for sure.
