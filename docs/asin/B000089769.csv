I'm afraid the woman on the front cover isn't in the movie, but don't worry as there are several great looking gals that are in it. This is a very well done soft porn film, with many ""scenes"", plenty of nudity and some pretty good acting and plot. This is the 87 minute ""R""  rated version, that has not been cut.

""Cyberella Forbidden Passions"" was spawned in 1996 and somehow they managed to get Debra K. Beatty as the lead seductress.  She's why you keep watching.  It helps if you have tried a career in the computer sciences, but as long as you've been lied to, cheated on, and stolen from, you'll relate to the plot.  Like I said, you watch this film for Debra K. Beatty.  This version here on Amazon has more of what you want to watch in the video, the shorter version is edited enough that you won't finish it.  If you're a Victorian prig looking for stellar thespian skills, skip this.  If you have an hour and a half to indulge a rise in your Levi's, this DVD is the ticket.

It doesn't change anything with regards to the plot, really, but if that isn't your primary reason for watching this movie, it can make a difference.  The plot is kind of cool; the protagonist is a (attractive, smart) computer geek who, after her boyfriend leaves her abruptly, dies in an accident while plugged into her virtual reality program.  Awakening in an afterlife that has windows into the live world through virtual reality, Mara discovers that she has to ""visit"" live people to help them, and to learn her own lesson along the way.

735891,A2MF0N72JVXDAP,B000089769,The Phantom,"[8, 8]","Well this was interesting. I thought that I had seen (or at least heard of) darn near every soft-core B movie from this era, the mid 1990s, but I'd never heard of this one until stumbling across it on Amazon. And for the era, it's not bad, with big-breasted Debra Beatty as the dead protagonist in a weird VR Purgatory. The plot doesn't make a lot of sense, really, but Debra pulls out her twin towers a BUNCH of times, even goes full frontal a couple, and that's nice. Includes a token lesbian scene here just about the time when these movies became obsessed with including such. The sex is about average for something in this genre from the mid 1990s.It probably would have been good enough for four stars from me, except that every scene is shot in that darned dark lighting, as if they throw blackout curtains all over the room and lit the performers with one 60-watt incandescent lamp bulb.
