It's also fun to see the TARDIS changing into something other than a police box for  the first and, so far, last time in the series. Colin Baker is very good in this one, despite, as usual, having to work against his unspeakable costume.

Cybermen in the London underground, a new doctor, mercinaries, diamond robers, new aliens (the cryons), a working cameleon cirtut in the TARDIS, Haley's Comet, a return to the frozen Cyber tombs on Telos and even a return visit to the junk yard where Doctor Who all began in 1963... Whew!The story grabs you from the first minute and never lets you go; Right up to the bloody, corpse filled final seconds. New doctor Colin Baker realy shines here. Everything we were hoping Colin Baker's doctor would be is evident here. He is brash and bold and taking on all comers including the Cyber Controller himself. The sixth doctor has no problem picking up a gun (or Cyber laser)and defending himself and the earth from who or what ever threatens. This is Colin Baker's best performance; I still find it regretable he was never really given a chance to grow into the role ( He was one of the scape goats for the 1986 hiatus).You get excellent performances from the supporting cast as well which just adds to a gripping ending since none of them live to see the end of the episode. There are multiple reference to the show's past and a timely subplot envolving the Cyberman's plan to crash Haley's Comet into the Earth (Haley's Comet was in our ""area"" for real in 1985). I could go on and on about this episode but lets not spoil it for those who have not seen this episode yet. If you are one of them I say go for it and buy this one; Trust me! you will not be disapointed!Ofcourse, every Doctor Who episode has it's nae sayers and this one is no exception. Some say the plot is too convoluted, the Cyber Controler is too ""rotund"", and the Cybermen in the frozen tombs on Telos do not look like the ones in the old Troughton episode ""Tomb of the Cybermen"". To these points I say keep in mind the BBC did not spend a ton of money on Doctor Who back in the day (1963 to1989). They would never spend money on two diferent styles of Cybermen. Infact they would never spent much money on the show at all...Isn't that what we loved about the show in the first place. For the short commings in this episode I say I would put this episode up against any in the show's history.

The same year in which a polar research team are getting images of a strange planet heading towards them.  The Doctor knows it is the planet Mondas the Cybermen orginial home planet to which he destroyed and cost him his life and a new regenration.  With very little clues the Doctor and Peri investigate where this signal is coming from and who is sending it?Meanwhile a group of thieves have gathered to a high end jewerly store to rob it.  They are lead by a man named Lytton who informs them that they will be robbing it today instead of its time orginially told by him.  This gives the rest of them little time to gather the supplies needed and be ready to pull of the heist.  Lytoon doesn't want excuses he wants results and tells them to meet at the point planned out.  What none of them know is that Lytton is in fact a duplicate created by the Dalkes and sole survivor of a war between the Daleks and Davros forces from the future.  Now on Earth he seems intent on stealing and making himself comfortable in the 20th century.  Or is there something else he is hiding from them?While this is going on strange disaperances have been taking place in the sewers of London as work crews and engineers have gone missing.  No one knows why or what has happen to them.  With Lytton and his gang finally in the very same sewers with the missing people the Doctor discovers the signal and wonders who could be sneidng it let alone leaving the entry way into the sewers. But before he can make sense of what is going on he and Peri are attacked by two police officers.  As to why they were willing to kill the two of them with no other choice the Doctor and Peri head into the sewers to find out what this all means.Lytton has taken his gang away from the site of where the heist is to take place and takes them deeper into the sewers.  One of them changes his mind and runs away realizing that this is not what he signed on for and Lytton threatens to kill the other if he leaves.  With no choice they folow him in the deeper parts only to find the Cybermen.  Lytton has a plan and it involves an  alliance with them and has given them a gift the Doctor.  For what the Doctor doesn't know is the Cybermen have a plan and there Cyber Controller alive and functional on Telos.  With these things they will ensalve the Earth and become masters of time itself.  Can the Doctor stop them and discover how they have managed to go into time?

1238379,A1EBJ93E1T50RT,B001U3ZYXY,Jason A. Miller,"[10, 11]","The plot of ""Attack of the Cybermen"" is very easy to describe, really.  The Cybermen seek to travel back in time to Earth in 1985 to make sure that the events ofDoctor Who - The Tenth Planet [VHS] in 1986 never take place.Actually it's a little more complex than that.  There are actually two factions of Cybermen, each led by familiar characters from the show's past history: there's the Cyber Leader (last seen inDoctor Who - Earthshock (Episode 122)andDoctor Who: The Five Doctors (Episode 130) (25th Anniversary Edition)) on Earth, and then there's the Cyber Controller (last seen inDoctor Who: The Tomb of the Cybermen (Episode 37)) on the Cyber home planet of Telos.  And the Cybermen don't just have one scheme to change history -- they have three.  First they've acquired a time machine that accidentally landed on Telos; then they accidentally walk into the TARDIS on Earth in 1985; and finally they plan to divert the course of Halley's Comet.Sorry, that's not enough.  I'm still not doing the story justice.  The Cybermen aren't alone in this story -- they're opposed by the Cryons, a race of sub-zero female humanoids.  One of the Cryons is played by a great-granddaughter of Sigmund Freud; another is played by actress Sarah Berger, who on the DVD commentary track likens her mustachioed outer-space costume to a psychedelic Hitler.  But because the Cryons are sub-zero, they can't act in their own interest and in fact don't show up until the story's three-quarter mark.  Instead they've hired their own white knight: Lytton, last seen inDoctor Who - Resurrection of the Daleks (Episode 134).  Lytton's a cold-blooded killer and here has seven different henchmen helping him out: two mute policemen left over from ""Resurrection""; two half-Cybernized slaves on Telos; and three Earth-bound jewel thieves.  Of the jewel thieves, one is actually an undercover cop out to arrest Lytton; another is played by Brian Glover, who gets off the episodes best lines.  None of these seven characters come to happy ends.And, lest we forget, the Doctor and Peri are in this story too.  The Doctor doesn't have much to do with the plot -- he's still mentally unstable from the effects of his regeneration -- but he does temporarily fix the TARDIS's long-faulty chameleon circuit (which causes Brian Glover to query: ""Time travel in an organ?!"").There's nothing wrong with an overly ambitious ""Doctor Who"" plot (witnessDoctor Who - City of Death (Episode 105)).  There's also nothing wrong with a pessimistic, downbeat script (seeDoctor Who - The Caves of Androzani (Episode 136)).  Here, however, ""Attack of the Cybermen"" never gels into a likeable story.  Unlike ""City of Death"", there are here at least two more plot threads than the story can reasonably handle.  And unlike ""Androzani"", where the Doctor served as the story's moral center (and tragic hero), and where Sharaz Jek was a lyrical hero/villain, in ""Attack"" the Doctor is largely peripheral to the plot, and Lytton (last seen slaughtering lots of humans in ""Resurrection"") is miscast as a morally ambiguous good guy.The DVD extra features are plentiful.  Anytime Eric Saward (series script editor and this episode's pseudonymous author) shows up, you know a fellow show contributor is about to get thrown under the bus.  Here is ire is aimed not at show producer John Nathan-Turner, but rather at someone named Ian Levine.  Levine, a figure well known in British fan circles about 25 years ago, claims to have co-written the episode -- to the extent that he suggested a lot of continuity-heavy plot devices.  If true, Levine certainly did the story no favors.  For example, it's nice to see Telos again, 18 years after its last appearance, but the Cyber Controller (played by the same actor from 18 years ago) has no plot utility.  Ultimately it seems that ""Attack"" has no message or plot of its own -- all it seeks to do is recreate sequences from past Cybermen stories -- and once Brian Glover's character is offed, there's no-one left to root for.",3,"""I thought I looked like a psychedelic Hitler!""",1249776000,"08 9, 2009",2009,4013,"['plot', 'Attack', 'Cybermen', 'very', 'easy', 'describe', 'really', 'Cybermen', 'seek', 'travel', 'back', 'time', 'Earth', '1985', 'make', 'sure', 'events', 'ofDoctor', 'Who', 'Tenth', 'Planet', '[', 'VHS', ']', '1986', 'never', 'take', 'place.Actually', 'little', 'more', 'complex', 'are', 'actually', 'two', 'factions', 'Cybermen', 'led', 'familiar', 'characters', 'show', 'past', 'history', 'Cyber', 'Leader', 'last', 'seen', 'inDoctor', 'Who', 'Earthshock', 'Episode', '122', 'andDoctor', 'Who', 'Five', 'Doctors', 'Episode', '130', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'Earth', 'then', 'Cyber', 'Controller', 'last', 'seen', 'inDoctor', 'Who', 'Tomb', 'Cybermen', 'Episode', '37', 'Cyber', 'home', 'planet', 'Telos', 'Cybermen', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'have', 'one', 'scheme', 'change', 'history', 'have', 'three', 'First', ""'ve"", 'acquired', 'time', 'machine', 'accidentally', 'landed', 'Telos', 'then', 'accidentally', 'walk', 'TARDIS', 'Earth', '1985', 'finally', 'plan', 'divert', 'course', 'Halley', 'Comet.Sorry', 'not', 'enough', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'doing', 'story', 'justice', 'Cybermen', 'are', ""n't"", 'alone', 'story', ""'re"", 'opposed', 'Cryons', 'race', 'sub-zero', 'female', 'humanoids', 'One', 'Cryons', 'played', 'great-granddaughter', 'Sigmund', 'Freud', 'played', 'actress', 'Sarah', 'Berger', 'who', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'track', 'mustachioed', 'outer-space', 'costume', 'psychedelic', 'Hitler', 'Cryons', 'are', 'sub-zero', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'own', 'interest', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'story', 'three-quarter', 'mark', 'Instead', ""'ve"", 'hired', 'own', 'white', 'knight', 'Lytton', 'last', 'seen', 'inDoctor', 'Who', 'Resurrection', 'Daleks', 'Episode', '134', 'Lytton', 'cold-blooded', 'killer', 'here', 'seven', 'different', 'henchmen', 'helping', 'two', 'mute', 'policemen', 'left', 'over', 'Resurrection', 'two', 'half-Cybernized', 'slaves', 'Telos', 'three', 'Earth-bound', 'jewel', 'thieves', 'jewel', 'thieves', 'one', 'actually', 'undercover', 'cop', 'arrest', 'Lytton', 'played', 'Brian', 'Glover', 'who', 'episodes', 'best', 'lines', 'None', 'seven', 'characters', 'come', 'happy', 'ends.And', 'forget', 'Doctor', 'Peri', 'are', 'story', 'too', 'Doctor', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'plot', 'still', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'effects', 'regeneration', 'temporarily', 'fix', 'TARDIS', 'long-faulty', 'chameleon', 'circuit', 'Brian', 'Glover', 'query', 'Time', 'travel', 'organ', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'overly', 'ambitious', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'plot', 'witnessDoctor', 'Who', 'City', 'Death', 'Episode', '105', 'also', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'pessimistic', 'downbeat', 'script', 'seeDoctor', 'Who', 'Caves', 'Androzani', 'Episode', '136', 'Here', 'however', 'Attack', 'Cybermen', 'never', 'likeable', 'story', 'City', 'Death', 'are', 'here', 'least', 'two', 'more', 'plot', 'threads', 'story', 'can', 'reasonably', 'handle', 'Androzani', 'where', 'Doctor', 'served', 'story', 'moral', 'center', 'tragic', 'hero', 'where', 'Sharaz', 'Jek', 'was', 'lyrical', 'hero/villain', 'Attack', 'Doctor', 'largely', 'peripheral', 'plot', 'Lytton', 'last', 'seen', 'slaughtering', 'lots', 'humans', 'Resurrection', 'miscast', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'good', 'guy.The', 'DVD', 'extra', 'features', 'are', 'plentiful', 'Anytime', 'Eric', 'Saward', 'series', 'script', 'editor', 'episode', 'pseudonymous', 'author', 'up', 'know', 'fellow', 'show', 'contributor', 'get', 'thrown', 'bus', 'Here', 'ire', 'aimed', 'not', 'show', 'producer', 'John', 'Nathan-Turner', 'rather', 'someone', 'named', 'Ian', 'Levine', 'Levine', 'figure', 'well', 'known', 'British', 'fan', 'circles', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'claims', 'have', 'co-written', 'episode', 'extent', 'suggested', 'lot', 'continuity-heavy', 'plot', 'devices', 'true', 'Levine', 'certainly', 'did', 'story', 'favors', 'example', 'nice', 'see', 'Telos', 'again', '18', 'years', 'last', 'appearance', 'Cyber', 'Controller', 'played', 'same', 'actor', '18', 'years', 'ago', 'plot', 'utility', 'Ultimately', 'Attack', 'message', 'plot', 'own', 'do', 'recreate', 'sequences', 'past', 'Cybermen', 'stories', 'once', 'Brian', 'Glover', 'character', 'offed', 'no-one', 'left', 'root']",N/A

I liked them better than the Cybermen, who are my favorite recurring enemies on Doctor Who.  I have always liked the Cybermen much better than the Daleks.  Except for the inane activities of the two prisoners on the Cybermen's planet of Telos, this is a nicely crafted story.  There is a bit of double-double crossing going on with the Lytton character.  The effects and sets are a bit better than many earlier classic Doctor Who stories. In the new series we often see how the Doctor is not perfect and things can go awry.  The final scene with Lytton is a great example of an early move toward that direction.One of the ongoing gags is the Doctor's attempt to fix the Chamelion circuit so that the TARDIS-police box would blend with its surrounding. I loved this and I always wished they continued on this path because it opened up many site gags. The police box was never that big a deal to me but purists were appalled when that police box prop was somehow threatened.EXTRAS: The behind the scenes documentary is quite interesting and there are a good mixture of actors doing the DVD audio commentary.

But fortunately, he is a lot better in this one than in many of his other stories and he is certainly better in this one than in his premiere story. In fact, he's brilliant! Too bad about his other stories. The plot is decent with the Cybermen trying to alter history and prevent the destruction of their home planet Mondas which was destroyed in their very first story ""The Tenth Planet"". You've got some nice action pieces in this one. The Cybermen are once again turning people into Cybermen - something that hasn't been done since the Patrick Trougton story ""The Invasion"". You get to see the Doctor return to both the junkyard from ""An Unearthly Child"" and the planet Telos from ""The Tomb of the Cybermen"". Part One's cliffhanger is excellent. You've got a few scary parts in this one as well as a little bit of comedy.Unfortunately, the tombs on Telos look like crap and nothing like the ones in ""The Tomb of the Cybermen"". The Cyber Controller is a little bit too fat to be a Cyberman. The Cryons look ridiculous (blame that on the costume designers). And the Cybermen are too easy to kill in this one. I would still recommend this one, but I would have rather seen a better Cyberman story released on DVD first like ""Revenge of the Cybermen"" or ""The Tenth Planet"".",3,"A good story, but not the best Cybermen one.",1237075200,"03 15, 2009",2009,1606,"['one', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Better', 'Sylvester', 'McCoy', 'Cyberman', 'story', 'Silver', 'Nemesis', 'think', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'story', 'Revenge', 'Cybermen', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'story', 'Tenth', 'Planet', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'first', 'are', 'better', 'stories', 'better', 'Doctors.First', 'Colin', 'Baker', 'was', 'least', 'favorite', 'Doctor', 'fortunately', 'lot', 'better', 'one', 'many', 'other', 'stories', 'certainly', 'better', 'one', 'premiere', 'story', 'fact', 'brilliant', 'Too', 'bad', 'other', 'stories', 'plot', 'decent', 'Cybermen', 'trying', 'alter', 'history', 'prevent', 'destruction', 'home', 'planet', 'Mondas', 'was', 'destroyed', 'very', 'first', 'story', 'Tenth', 'Planet', ""'ve"", 'got', 'nice', 'action', 'pieces', 'one', 'Cybermen', 'are', 'once', 'again', 'turning', 'people', 'Cybermen', 'something', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'Patrick', 'Trougton', 'story', 'Invasion', 'get', 'see', 'Doctor', 'return', 'junkyard', 'Unearthly', 'Child', 'planet', 'Telos', 'Tomb', 'Cybermen', 'Part', 'One', 'cliffhanger', 'excellent', ""'ve"", 'got', 'few', 'scary', 'parts', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'little', 'bit', 'comedy.Unfortunately', 'tombs', 'Telos', 'look', 'crap', 'nothing', 'ones', 'Tomb', 'Cybermen', 'Cyber', 'Controller', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'fat', 'be', 'Cyberman', 'Cryons', 'look', 'ridiculous', 'blame', 'costume', 'designers', 'Cybermen', 'are', 'too', 'easy', 'kill', 'one', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'rather', 'seen', 'better', 'Cyberman', 'story', 'released', 'DVD', 'first', 'Revenge', 'Cybermen', 'Tenth', 'Planet']",N/A

In some cases, these newer ideas have been derived from original Doctor Who, but received far more attention in their new incarnation, stealing the credit from those who thought of it before.""Attack of the Cybermen"" is a perfect example.  Anyone who has watched ""Star Trek:  First Contact"" may draw comparisons with the premise presented in that film and the one in the Who story (which aired over a decade earlier) reviewed here.  In both cases, we have soul-less mechanized humanoids clad in implants and hoses (the Borg are basically cybermen with a hive conciounse, after all) traveling back in time to prevent their own destruction by altering past events.  Does anyone really believe its just coincidence?I also wonder which, if any, episodes are liked by the detractors of this one.  This definitely isn't Who's finest hour, but it is nowhere near its worst, either.  A solid Cyberman story, with the return of Litton, the merc from ""Resurrection of the Daleks"", a return visit to Telos, and repair of the chameleon circuit of the TARDIS, it does seem there is a lot going on, but it never really gets confusing, even if one is unfamiliar with ""Tomb of the Cybermen"" or ""the Tenth Planet"", as those 2 stories are referenced enough to give the viewer a good idea of why events are occurring as they are.  Also, the roles of the 2 prisoners attempting escape from the Cybermen were well-cast, and it was agony watching the characters' progress.  Also, its good to see 2 things:  1)the doctor refreshingly and realistically finding no recourse other than to picking up a gun and blasting an enemy, and 2)his misreading of an admittedly ambiguous good guy as a bad guy.  It's good to see him as desperate or fallible once in a while, instead of as a superman who always has just the right idea at just the right time.If you like Doctor Who, you'll enjoy this one.  If you have issues with it, then I don't see how you'll like any other Who from this period anyway.  They can't all be (insert your favorite Who serial here).  As for what the fanzine polls say, I wouldn't put too much stock in them.  Fan-boys are generally neurotic about their own favorite subject matter and often don't reflect what normal people think anyhow, as evidenced by their apparent dislike for this story.  Then again, perhaps I'm being overly harsh;  Though I don't think it's been mentioned, I have noticed how from the last couple of the Baker years until classic Who's demise, the characters in the stories became increasingly cynical and unlikeable, and this seems to be often reflected in the popularity of those particular stories.  That's why I find, in Litton's final redemption, a symbol for what the series itself needed.",5,"Decent, Solid Cyberman Story",1257552000,"11 7, 2009",2009,2907,"['think', 'when', 'fans', 'look', 'back', 'old', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'forget', 'are', 'viewing', 'haze', 'ideas', 'experiences', 'came', 'long', 'classic', 'serials', 'had', 'aired', 'cases', 'newer', 'ideas', 'have', 'been', 'derived', 'original', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'received', 'far', 'more', 'attention', 'new', 'incarnation', 'stealing', 'credit', 'who', 'thought', 'Attack', 'Cybermen', 'perfect', 'example', 'Anyone', 'who', 'watched', 'Star', 'Trek', 'First', 'Contact', 'may', 'draw', 'comparisons', 'premise', 'presented', 'film', 'one', 'Who', 'story', 'aired', 'decade', 'earlier', 'reviewed', 'here', 'cases', 'have', 'soul-less', 'mechanized', 'humanoids', 'clad', 'implants', 'hoses', 'Borg', 'are', 'basically', 'cybermen', 'hive', 'conciounse', 'traveling', 'back', 'time', 'prevent', 'own', 'destruction', 'altering', 'past', 'events', 'Does', 'anyone', 'really', 'believe', 'just', 'coincidence', 'also', 'wonder', 'episodes', 'are', 'liked', 'detractors', 'one', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'Who', 'finest', 'hour', 'nowhere', 'worst', 'either', 'solid', 'Cyberman', 'story', 'return', 'Litton', 'merc', 'Resurrection', 'Daleks', 'return', 'visit', 'Telos', 'repair', 'chameleon', 'circuit', 'TARDIS', 'seem', 'lot', 'going', 'never', 'really', 'confusing', 'even', 'one', 'unfamiliar', 'Tomb', 'Cybermen', 'Tenth', 'Planet', '2', 'stories', 'are', 'referenced', 'give', 'viewer', 'good', 'idea', 'why', 'events', 'are', 'occurring', 'are', 'Also', 'roles', '2', 'prisoners', 'attempting', 'escape', 'Cybermen', 'were', 'well-cast', 'was', 'agony', 'watching', 'characters', 'progress', 'Also', 'good', 'see', '2', 'things', '1', 'doctor', 'refreshingly', 'realistically', 'finding', 'recourse', 'other', 'picking', 'up', 'gun', 'blasting', 'enemy', '2', 'misreading', 'admittedly', 'ambiguous', 'good', 'guy', 'bad', 'guy', 'good', 'see', 'desperate', 'fallible', 'once', 'while', 'instead', 'superman', 'who', 'always', 'just', 'right', 'idea', 'just', 'right', 'time.If', 'Doctor', 'Who', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'one', 'have', 'issues', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', ""'ll"", 'like', 'other', 'Who', 'period', 'anyway', 'ca', ""n't"", 'all', 'be', 'insert', 'favorite', 'Who', 'serial', 'here', 'what', 'fanzine', 'polls', 'say', 'would', ""n't"", 'put', 'too', 'much', 'stock', 'Fan-boys', 'are', 'generally', 'neurotic', 'own', 'favorite', 'subject', 'matter', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'reflect', 'what', 'normal', 'people', 'think', 'anyhow', 'evidenced', 'apparent', 'dislike', 'story', 'Then', 'again', 'perhaps', ""'m"", 'being', 'overly', 'harsh', 'Though', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'been', 'mentioned', 'have', 'noticed', 'how', 'last', 'couple', 'Baker', 'years', 'classic', 'Who', 'demise', 'characters', 'stories', 'became', 'increasingly', 'cynical', 'unlikeable', 'be', 'often', 'reflected', 'popularity', 'particular', 'stories', 'why', 'find', 'Litton', 'final', 'redemption', 'symbol', 'what', 'series', 'needed']",N/A

Loria,"[3, 5]","The first non-regeneration story and season 22 opener....Attack of the Cybermen was subject to the format change applied to the series during Colin Baker's tenure as the 6th Doctor, broadcast as a 2 parter with 45 min episodes instead of the traditional venue, 4 - 6 week story arcs with 25 min episodes...the script writers did adapt well to this change and the format change is just one problem added to a period in the show's history already replete with problems, including Colin Baker's portrayal itself, with DW fans placing Baker at the bottom of the Timelord's incarnations (Although his performances over the past few years in the original audio plays for Big Finish productions have been well received). Baker's intention to do a Hartnell and start as an ""disagreeable"" Doctor becoming steadily more ""lovable,""  a tactic which blew up in his face.The story is a mess, referencing some stories from the 5th , 1st and 2nd Doctor's run, unfortunately the two major contributing story arc are part of the missing serial (""The Tenth Planet "" or last lst Doctor and the 1st Cyberman tale, and the rediscovered missing classic ""Tomb of the Cybermen."") as I can follow it the story has the Doctor stopping over in Totter's Lane (the landing site of the TARDIS in the 60's series Pilot) in order to repair the chameleon circuit (or cloaking device and reason for the Police-Box form) and chase a overcomplicated distress signal, mean while, Lytton the Dalek merc from Resurrection of the Dalek is planning to rob the Bank of England through sewers, the scene of an attack at the opening of the story...the Doc and `Peri are well out of the action even when they stumble upon Lytton's ""cop"" cronies...beneath Fleet Street sewer workers are becoming Cybermen and future Cybermen plots to hit Earth with Halley's Comet thereby altering history and saving the original Cyber-Home world Mondas (as seen in Tenth Planet, if you were lucky enough to see it in the 60's or read the Target paperback) there are some side trips to the Cybermen's adopted homeworld of Telo (setting of TOMB) the CyberLeader happens to still be alive on Telos, the Doctor fills us in on the history of  the world and its ex-indigenous  inhabitants, the Cryons, who the Cybermen eradicated in order to use their chilly cities to keep themselves in cryogenic stasis...I told you it was a mess.....The snapping and sniping between the newly regenerated 6th Doctor and Peri are tiresome, as are all the wasted opportunities to put them in the story as participates. There are some interesting, if random characters introduced in two failed attempts of Cyber-conversion who have had arms & legs replaced, the slaves named Bates and Stratton escapees from workparty on TELOS where they decapitate a Cyberman and laughablely use the head as a helmet to disguise themselves and enter Cyber HQ. The Lytton character is also intriguing as is the TARDIS' short-lived circuit repair which features some fun transfigurations from the series classic Police Call-Box  are fun, if pointless. The first solid glimpse at the Cyberman conversion process (unless you count some moments in the Tomb of the Cybermen) is very disappointing considering the wait, the ""victims"" aren't nearly as disturbing as the 21st century versions from the 10th Doctor's Cyber-stories...what remains disturbing is Lytton's fate...the hand crushing sequence still strikes a cord, even compared to some of the more intense moments of the new series. The word ""disturbing"" can also be applied to the Doctor, after already packet loaded guns through part one, he bloodthirstily shoots the baddie at the show's climax, none of the Doctor's ubiquitous ""cleverness"" or ingenuity...just a gun...sure that's how ""Invasion of Time"" ends, but there the Doctor has the class to have no memory of the whole messy affair.Drinking Games...Drink whenever.......a completely new group of characters are introduced in a completely new setting....the Doctor uses over-the-top violence to move the scene forward (throttling Cop, Cybermen etc.)...you lose the thread of the story and begin flipping through series Reference guidebooks attempting to catch up....the TARDIS changes shape (cheers)....Peri annoys or gripes....the Doctor looks at her as

1238385,A2MHDZXWWF0VIN,B001U3ZYXY,Matthew Kresal,"[0, 1]","Attack Of The Cybermen: the sixth Doctor's second TV story and the first story of actor Colin Baker's  first full season as the Doctor. Since it was first aired in 1985, the timing of the story (just weeks before the show was put hiatus by the BBC) as well as fans looking at the story itself in terms of its performances, production values and script has made it one of the most discussed stories of the old series. What are we to make of the story then?The quality of the performances are varied at best. Colin Baker was still settling into the role of the Doctor and was still being played as an irascible and at times downright unlikeable, something that hampers the story as it makes it hard to sympathize with the Doctor. Nicola Bryant seems to still be finding her feet as well, which doesn't do the story any favors either. The supporting cast fares a bit better particularity Maurice Colbourne's Lytton and the excellent double act of Jonathan David and Michael Atwell as the Cybermen's prisoners Stratton and Bates (though they actually do exceedingly little in the actual story). Others such as the various actresses playing Cryons and Michael Kilgarrif's Cyber-Controller don't comes across anywhere near as well thanks to their costumes and the script (the latter also affecting Brian Glover as Griffiths).As a production, it's adequate at best. The largely Earthbound first episode comes across the best with some good location work and some good sewer sets. When the story leaves Earth, it runs into trouble. Despite attempts by director Matthew Robinson and his cameramen to make Telos look interesting, it comes across as a dull quarry (which is exactly what it was). The Cybermen's base and tombs come across as being dull and cheap, something made even more surprising since this was the first story of the season and there was certainly a bit more money to spend on the production. The music of Malcom Clarke also varies greatly in quality from effective (such as the Cybermen theme he reprises from his own Earthshock score) to wildly inappropriate (the odd, almost humorous pieces of music used for the robbers and during scenes in part one). Even at its best the story can't make up for its biggest problem: the script.This story has long been controversial for its use of continuity. The story is heavily based in the Cybermen stories of the past including the destruction of their home-world of Mondas from their debut story The Tenth Planet, the Cybermen using the London sewers from The Invasion as well as the Cyber-Controller and the titular tomb of the Cybermen from the (then missing) 1967 story of the same name. There's also Lytton from the previous year's Resurrection Of The Daleks as well as the TARDIS chameleon circuit (which functions on and off throughout the first episode). This was to be televised Doctor Who at its most continuity heavy with the result being a tangled skein that it is all but impenetrable to many fans, let along members of the general public. Doctor Who in the mid-1980s has often been criticized for its over reliance on the show's continuity which is something that, when the era is viewing on whole, seems odd until stories like this where its easy to see where that thought came from.And some of the continuity usage seems to be downright cynical as well. John Nathan-Turner hit upon the idea of changing the outside of the TARDIS, ditching the familiar police box shape and mined the notion for all it was worth to publicize the show in the lead up to Attack being broadcast. While that's not necessarily cynical in its own right, spending a chunk of already limited screen time to tell an already over-packed story simply to annoy some fans certainly is.On the flip side of that is the use of elements from Tomb Of The Cybermens from the tombs right up to bringing back a frankly unsuitable Michael Kilgarriff simply because he'd played the part 18 years earlier. It feels as though that what the production team was trying to do was to remake Tomb Of The Cybermen for a generation of fans who (as far as was known in 1984-85) would never get to see it. It was an attempt to please the fans that instead meant that the story served simply as an example of what happens when loose ends and memories of a story thought to be lost forever were forced to fit into a story already too complex for its own good.This story then, like much of the Colin Baker era, is the story of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Doctor Who's fate was on the line and it needed, perhaps more than it had previously, to be a popular success. What it instead served up was a story that jumbled continuity together, mixed into a story that was made even more complex and the public walked away from it and never came back.

Baloney,the 1980's had alot of great stories and the three actors who played the doctor did a great job. Sure my favorite doctor remains the jon pertwee era, but each dcctor is a incarnation of the doctor and different.  Colin Baker was my favorite of the three 1980's doctors and this is a great story. The show was attacked for being too violent when first broadcast and this remains a problem with some fans to this day. I personally never thought this was the case as ""Doctor who"" has always been a show in which people died in.  Colin Bakers doctor is very athletic and solid and the only bad thing perhaps was the terrible outfit he wore.  And by any standard it is terrible it's  a multicolored ragtype thing.  But that's a small complaint when enjoying Colin Bakers' great work as the sixth doctor.  The cybermen are chilling killers in this story and there is even a great sense of pathos to the whole show.This story only had two episodes but that's because the series went to 45 minutes per episode at that time.  I believe that these episodes can now be seen as good sci fi 24 years after they were first shown and all the 1980's bickering should be left behind.  It wasn't the 1980's doctors who killed the show it was the new (at that time) masters of the BBC who were determined to kill it off because they hated sci fi and wanted to save money.  Colin Baker did a great job in his run as doctor and that is truly evident in this story.  This shows special effects,( circa 1984)is pre-computer generated images (cgi) and should be viewed accordingly aware of this.",5,excellent dr who adventure,1249430400,"08 5, 2009",2009,1736,"['One', 'thing', 'being', 'fan', 'doctor', 'who', 'have', 'suffer', 'theidiocy', 'only', 'first', 'four', 'doctors', 'classic', 'series', 'were', 'great', 'Baloney', '1980', 'had', 'alot', 'great', 'stories', 'three', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'doctor', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Sure', 'favorite', 'doctor', 'jon', 'pertwee', 'era', 'dcctor', 'incarnation', 'doctor', 'different', 'Colin', 'Baker', 'was', 'favorite', 'three', '1980', 'doctors', 'great', 'story', 'show', 'was', 'attacked', 'being', 'too', 'violent', 'when', 'first', 'broadcast', 'problem', 'fans', 'day', 'personally', 'never', 'thought', 'was', 'case', 'Doctor', 'who', 'always', 'been', 'show', 'people', 'died', 'Colin', 'Bakers', 'doctor', 'very', 'athletic', 'solid', 'only', 'bad', 'thing', 'perhaps', 'was', 'terrible', 'outfit', 'wore', 'standard', 'terrible', 'multicolored', 'ragtype', 'thing', 'small', 'complaint', 'when', 'enjoying', 'Colin', 'Bakers', 'great', 'work', 'sixth', 'doctor', 'cybermen', 'are', 'chilling', 'killers', 'story', 'even', 'great', 'sense', 'pathos', 'whole', 'show.This', 'story', 'only', 'had', 'two', 'episodes', 'series', 'went', '45', 'minutes', 'episode', 'time', 'believe', 'episodes', 'can', 'now', 'be', 'seen', 'good', 'sci', '24', 'years', 'were', 'first', 'shown', '1980', 'bickering', 'should', 'be', 'left', 'was', ""n't"", '1980', 'doctors', 'who', 'killed', 'show', 'was', 'new', 'time', 'masters', 'BBC', 'who', 'were', 'determined', 'kill', 'off', 'hated', 'sci', 'fi', 'wanted', 'save', 'money', 'Colin', 'Baker', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'run', 'doctor', 'truly', 'evident', 'story', 'special', 'effects', 'circa', '1984', 'pre-computer', 'generated', 'images', 'cgi', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'accordingly', 'aware']",N/A
