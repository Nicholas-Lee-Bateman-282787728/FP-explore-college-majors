Yes, the cruel, cynical rotund guy who lead the townsfolk to his house and tried to frighten him into leaving!  I'm hoping that this vcd is re-mastered sometime this year.  Now that Sony has managed to strike a mega-million dollar deal to publish and record previously written, but yet-to-be released songs, etc., I'm hoping that there will be re-makes of both Ghosts and Moonwalker.I just watched Ghosts on my computer last night.  Another exciting example of Michael's unmatched brilliance.  As a devoted, long-time fan, I was so hoping for the day when Michael would focus his creative genius and extraordinary talents on film production and acting.  It's what he was hoping to do after the London concerts last year.Damn the media and the ""sucking"" gold-diggers for what they did to him!  A lesser man's spirit would have been crushed under the weight of all the rumors, cruel accusations, judgements and jealousy.  Still, they managed to rob him of many glorious, productive years.  I studied him closely in Ghosts.  He was mesmerizing--such a natural actor!  Combine that with a riveting storyline--perfectly created for his character--ghoulish but fun-to-listen to music, and you have a masterpiece of a short film!  He made skeletons ""sexy""!  He was scary, funny, and wonderfully sensual as always.  He exuded grace and mystery.  Thinking of him as this character caused me to imagine him in a sexy, seductive vampire role.  What hot, desirable woman wouldn't love to have him devour her for her blood?  He'd take Moonlight to the next level, ladies!  Gorgeous voice and dancing that evokes a wide range of emotions--lots of deep breaths and lusty thoughts!  God he was so hot!What a loss.  What a heartbreaking and profound loss to all who loved him.  In addition to loving and being adored by the lights of his life--his children, it's comforting to know that he also realized one of his fondest dreams:  to make his creations and his memory immortal.  They will live forever!  Hopefully, Ghosts and Moonwalker will both be remastered into Blue Rays or DVDs and released later this year, perhaps to celebrate his birthday!We all hope that over the course of time we'll be treated to unpublished and yet-to-be-cut songs, writings and poetry.  Maybe even another unforgettable short flick!  He was full of surprises.Michael = Magic!Michael.....we miss you so.  We hold loving thoughts for your children and family.  We know you are okay and at peace now.P.S. I saw This Is It five times at the theatre.  I just got my DVD yesterday but won't watch it until I get my new big screen HD-TV hooked up.
