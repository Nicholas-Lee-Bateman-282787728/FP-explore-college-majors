I've read a couple of the books this series was based on, but I don't get cable and hadn't given much thought to trying to see the series until I happened to start watching early episodes of NCIS. I liked Sasha Alexander as Kate Todd and decided I'd give her new series a try as well. I think Alexander is as good here as she was on NCIS and Harmon is probably better than she was as the district attorney in Law and Order. It's nice to see a show with women as the leads.

Isles in a very distant way could be described a little like a cross between Quincy & Bones, just a bit more upscale. Angie Harmon's Rizzoli plays her part well in spite of her rather eccentric Italian family and somehow manages to blend a combination of ""Starsky"" and ""Cagney"" [Cagney and Lacy, not James] into a single individual into a well above average portrayal of the role.Like any TV drama, it has episodes that vary from throughly excellent to barely believable and a plot mix that changes from predictable to surprising.All in all decent acting, better than average storylines, reasonable sequencing, quality sets and a relatively believable character set that slowly matures as this first series winds to a close. By the end of the season it was getting to the point of watching two a night instead of one overy other night.Whatever was behind Sasha Alexander leaving NCIS, this series has the opportunity to put her career firml back on track.

Thurlow,"[74, 82]","The good news about ""Rizzoli & Isles: The Complete First Season"" is that it gets Angie Harmon (Law and Order) and Sasha Alexander (NCIS) back on network TV.  The better news, depending on your tastes in police procedurals, is that it plunks the two of them down as mis-matched buddies in the middle of a rather dark, gritty crime drama.Angie Harmon is Jane Rizzoli, a tough, driven Boston detective who survived an earlier and nearly fatal encounter with a serial killer named Charles Hoyt. She was saved by her old partner, the recurring character detective Vince Korsack (an excellent Bruce McGill).  The edgy Jane has some unresolved trauma issues and a mother (Lorraine Bracco) waiting for Jane to settle down with a nice guy and start making grandchildren.  Jane would rather be just one of the guys.  Sasha Alexander is Dr. Maura Isles, Chief Medial Examiner, organized, strait-laced and often hilariously socially awkward. The two are an unlikely buddy team, but their teamwork and relationship grow steadily over the course of a short season.This first season is heavy on serial killers, featuring Charles Hoyt and some copy cat killers.  One episode has an intriguing throw back to the old Boston Strangler case.  The season conclusion offers a frightening cliff-hanger, made bearable only by the recent announcement that ""Rizzoli & Isles"" are returning for a second season in the summer of 20ll.",5,"Tough, Boston Tough...",1305590400,"05 17, 2011",2011,1405,"['good', 'news', 'Rizzoli', 'Isles', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'Angie', 'Harmon', 'Law', 'Order', 'Sasha', 'Alexander', 'NCIS', 'back', 'network', 'TV', 'better', 'news', 'depending', 'tastes', 'police', 'procedurals', 'two', 'down', 'mis-matched', 'buddies', 'middle', 'rather', 'dark', 'gritty', 'crime', 'drama.Angie', 'Harmon', 'Jane', 'Rizzoli', 'tough', 'driven', 'Boston', 'detective', 'who', 'survived', 'earlier', 'nearly', 'fatal', 'encounter', 'serial', 'killer', 'named', 'Charles', 'Hoyt', 'was', 'saved', 'old', 'partner', 'recurring', 'character', 'detective', 'Vince', 'Korsack', 'excellent', 'Bruce', 'McGill', 'edgy', 'Jane', 'unresolved', 'trauma', 'issues', 'mother', 'Lorraine', 'Bracco', 'waiting', 'Jane', 'settle', 'down', 'nice', 'guy', 'start', 'making', 'grandchildren', 'Jane', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'just', 'one', 'guys', 'Sasha', 'Alexander', 'Dr.', 'Maura', 'Isles', 'Chief', 'Medial', 'Examiner', 'organized', 'strait-laced', 'often', 'hilariously', 'socially', 'awkward', 'two', 'are', 'unlikely', 'buddy', 'team', 'teamwork', 'relationship', 'grow', 'steadily', 'course', 'short', 'season.This', 'first', 'season', 'heavy', 'serial', 'killers', 'featuring', 'Charles', 'Hoyt', 'copy', 'cat', 'killers', 'One', 'episode', 'intriguing', 'throw', 'back', 'old', 'Boston', 'Strangler', 'case', 'season', 'conclusion', 'frightening', 'cliff-hanger', 'made', 'bearable', 'only', 'recent', 'announcement', 'Rizzoli', 'Isles', 'are', 'returning', 'second', 'season', 'summer', '20ll']",Rizzoli & Isles: Season 1

Angie Harmon and Sasha Alexander's chemistry develops over the course of the season, You could almost describe them as sisters: both have enormous respect for each other, whilst taking the mickey out of each other (esp Harmon) and having genuine love and concern. Yes, Isles has similarities to Bones but I think she has a softness that perhaps Bones doesn't which has made it easier to develop empathy for her.The stories are good but perhaps gets resolved too quickly in certain episodes. The fact there is a continuing bad guy that haunts Rizzoli is good and hope he continues in Season 2.If you like Angie Harmon, you'll really like this show - her character is far more rounded that in her Law & Order days.Thoroughly enjoyable - can't wait for Season 2.",5,Love it!

But I have always loved Angie Harmon's work.  Since I NEVER pay full price for the first season of anything (and rarely pay full price for any season after that!) I had a long wait until the price came down enough to satisfy me before I finally bought Season 1.But this show got us right out of the gate!  I couldn't believe the fantastic chemistry between all the characters but especially between Angie and Sasha.  I think it made a lot of us wish we had a friend like that.  Bruce McGill has always been a favorite of mine as well as Lee Thompson Young ever since his Jet Jackson days on Disney.  No one failed to live up to expectations!  And there were a number of guest stars that were great to see.  Billy Burke from the Twilight series was one that I can name, but there were many others whose names escaped me, but whose faces were very familiar.I love just about anything set in Boston for some reason, so that was also a plus.  The story lines were great, too.  The Boston Strangler, Hoyt, and one about the Boston Marathon which was bittersweet since the bombings last year.  But each episode was at the very least watchable and fantastic at the most,.So I just ordered Season 2 and 3, even though the prices were higher than I like.

1360394,A7MEOXXTQHRPB,B003R4ZMPE,Marty W. Rhodes,"[0, 0]","I think this show is worth watching mainly for the character Jane Rizzoli played by Angie Harmon.  First, Harmon is very easy to look at.  But she is much more than a very pretty cop here.  She plays tough police detective Jane Rizzoli almost perfectly as a tomboy cop who feels totally out of place in a dress.  Her performance is a bit reminiscent of that of Sandra Bullock in the movie Miss Congeniality, which makes her character far from original, but nonetheless Harmon pulls it off very well. Harmon's performance and screen presence carry this show.The other title character, Maura Isles is played by Sasha Alexander.  I found the Isles character to be a bit inconsistent and hard to relate to, and I am something of a science buff.  But there is definitely room for growth with the character and hopefully that is what will happen in the next season.  The supporting cast was, honestly, pretty forgettable but again there is the potential for character growth there.  The writing was pretty good, although it did not vary much from the standard TV cop fare.So all in all, I recommend this series just for the fun of watching a quite good performance by the gorgeous Angie Harmon.  I plan to order the 2nd season in the hope that Harmon will continue her outstanding performances and the rest of the show's characters will grow on me.",4,Rizzoli & Isles season 1,1379116800,"09 14, 2013",2013,1342,"['think', 'show', 'worth', 'watching', 'mainly', 'character', 'Jane', 'Rizzoli', 'played', 'Angie', 'Harmon', 'First', 'Harmon', 'very', 'easy', 'look', 'much', 'more', 'very', 'pretty', 'cop', 'here', 'tough', 'police', 'detective', 'Jane', 'Rizzoli', 'almost', 'perfectly', 'tomboy', 'cop', 'who', 'totally', 'place', 'dress', 'performance', 'bit', 'reminiscent', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'movie', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', 'character', 'far', 'original', 'nonetheless', 'Harmon', 'off', 'very', 'well', 'Harmon', 'performance', 'screen', 'presence', 'carry', 'other', 'title', 'character', 'Maura', 'Isles', 'played', 'Sasha', 'Alexander', 'found', 'Isles', 'character', 'be', 'bit', 'inconsistent', 'hard', 'relate', 'am', 'something', 'science', 'buff', 'definitely', 'room', 'growth', 'character', 'hopefully', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'season', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'honestly', 'pretty', 'forgettable', 'again', 'potential', 'character', 'growth', 'there', 'writing', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'did', 'not', 'vary', 'much', 'standard', 'TV', 'cop', 'fare.So', 'recommend', 'series', 'just', 'fun', 'watching', 'quite', 'good', 'performance', 'gorgeous', 'Angie', 'Harmon', 'plan', 'order', '2nd', 'season', 'hope', 'Harmon', 'will', 'continue', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'rest', 'show', 'characters', 'will', 'grow']",Rizzoli & Isles: Season 1

The characters are also so one dimensional and bland that their characters just can't be taken seriously or anything else for that matter,  also the chemistry that they supposedly have and how they act with each other feels so much what we've seen between the two main characters of the show Bones it's a wonder why this show isn't just called Bones2:  The Boston Section.

The lead characters IMMEDIATELY had me after the first episode and the rest of the characters grew on me as the episodes went along (though not nearly so much as the casts of Castle and The Closer--maybe in the second season that will come).The mysteries are fairly obvious, but it's still fun to see the plots unfold, even if you have figured out what is going on fairly early. Angie Harmon and Sasha Alexander have really great friendship chemistry and I think that might be what sells the show for me. I like watching them develop as characters and watching how they grow through their interactions with each other.  The depth of the lead characters makes up for storylines that seem familiar if you have ever watched procedurals on t.v. before and supporting characters who can seem a little flat.
