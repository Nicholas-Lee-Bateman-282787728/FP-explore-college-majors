151420,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0792844726,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 10]","Meryl Streep always delivers, even when her films don't.  Such is the case with `She-Devil', a below average clich&eacute; ridden comedy about a scorned woman out to make her cheating husband pay.  Sure, `She-Devil' has its fair share of funny scenes, and Streep is utterly delightful, but the overall `been-there-done-that' feel that the film leaves me with is very disappointing.`She-Devil' tells the story of Ruth Patchett, an overweight mother of two married to an accountant named Bob who has a stray eye so-to-speak, an eye that stumbles upon the beautiful and famous Mary Fisher; an authoress who writes sleazy romance novels she claims are based off of her own bouts of passion.  When Bob begins his affair with Mary he starts to find every reason he can to leave Ruth, and when he finally does Ruth takes it into her own hands to exact her revenge.The performances are the only real highlight in a script marred with unoriginality.  Roseanne Barr is quite funny as Ruth, but her character is more antics than heart.  Ed Begley Jr. is decently heartless as Bob and Sylvia Miles is pretty funny as Mary's mother.But, like almost everything else, this is the Meryl show.  When the credits begin to roll the only name on your tongue will be Meryl Streep.  She is hilarious here (I swear I prefer her when she's funny) and completely steals the show from anyone else on the screen.  Sadly, she has done this character before, and much better.  Just look at 92's `Death Becomes Her' where she plays practically the same woman (wealthy, famous, beautiful husband stealer) yet with much grander results (the film is leagues better as well).In the end I can't recommend this film at all.  It has some funny moments but there are so many other films that broach this subject in a much fresher and more satisfying way.  If you are a die hard fan of the Streep (who isn't) then you might want to see this for that very fact, but she has such an eclectic and interesting resume that you are bound to find pleasure in just about any of her other films, so why waste your time here?",2,Get your Meryl fix elsewhere...,1217894400,"08 5, 2008",2008,2076,"['Meryl', 'Streep', 'always', 'even', 'when', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'Such', 'case', 'She-Devil', 'below', 'average', 'clich', 'eacute', 'ridden', 'comedy', 'scorned', 'woman', 'make', 'cheating', 'husband', 'pay', 'Sure', 'She-Devil', 'fair', 'share', 'funny', 'scenes', 'Streep', 'utterly', 'delightful', 'overall', 'been-there-done-that', 'feel', 'film', 'very', 'disappointing.', 'She-Devil', 'story', 'Ruth', 'Patchett', 'overweight', 'mother', 'two', 'married', 'accountant', 'named', 'Bob', 'who', 'stray', 'eye', 'so-to-speak', 'eye', 'beautiful', 'famous', 'Mary', 'Fisher', 'authoress', 'who', 'sleazy', 'romance', 'novels', 'claims', 'are', 'based', 'own', 'bouts', 'passion', 'When', 'Bob', 'affair', 'Mary', 'find', 'reason', 'can', 'leave', 'Ruth', 'when', 'finally', 'Ruth', 'own', 'hands', 'exact', 'revenge.The', 'performances', 'are', 'only', 'real', 'highlight', 'script', 'marred', 'unoriginality', 'Roseanne', 'Barr', 'quite', 'funny', 'Ruth', 'character', 'more', 'antics', 'heart', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'Jr.', 'decently', 'heartless', 'Bob', 'Sylvia', 'Miles', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Mary', 'mother.But', 'almost', 'everything', 'else', 'Meryl', 'show', 'When', 'credits', 'begin', 'roll', 'only', 'name', 'tongue', 'will', 'be', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'hilarious', 'here', 'swear', 'prefer', 'when', 'funny', 'completely', 'show', 'anyone', 'else', 'screen', 'Sadly', 'done', 'character', 'much', 'better', 'Just', 'look', '92', 'Death', 'Becomes', 'Her', 'where', 'practically', 'same', 'woman', 'wealthy', 'famous', 'beautiful', 'husband', 'stealer', 'yet', 'much', 'grander', 'results', 'film', 'leagues', 'better', 'as', 'well', 'end', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film', 'funny', 'moments', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'broach', 'subject', 'much', 'fresher', 'more', 'satisfying', 'way', 'are', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'Streep', 'who', ""n't"", 'then', 'might', 'want', 'see', 'very', 'fact', 'such', 'eclectic', 'interesting', 'resume', 'are', 'bound', 'find', 'pleasure', 'just', 'other', 'films', 'so', 'why', 'waste', 'time', 'here']",N/A

Looks like Ruth intends to get more than even; she finds out his values in order of priority (home, family, career and freedom.) then she commits her life to removing his assets in that order.

Her husband leaves her and the children for greener pastures.

Watch out, when Ruth Patchett (played by the queen of comedy Roseanne) gets ticked off she can cause a lot of damage (and laughs!!!)!! Her worthless excuse of a  husband Bob (Ed Begley Jr.) is at the center of Ruth's rage in this comedy about revenge. Roseanne's character learns that she is better than whatever her no-good husband thinks of her, and she sets out to prove him wrong and learns how to start a new life along the way. Meryl Streep's (Mary Fisher) character is totally over-the-top and the perfect addition to this already campy classic. Mary Fisher is a cross between Joan Crawford and Jackie Collins.There are so many funny scenes in this movie. Perhaps the funniest is when Bob drives Ruth home from the party in the beginning of the film. Poor Ruth has to sit in the back seat of their two-door car while Mary Fisher sits in the front next to her husband! And the bum doesn't even have the common decency to drive Ruth to the door, instead dropping her off a block away from the house! It was also a hoot when Ruth drops off the kids (Andy & Nicolette) at Miss Fisher's because ""the children would like to see their father."" And of course we can't forget Mary Fisher's kooky mother. Sylvia Mills plays the senior Mrs. Fisher with such comedy and finesse; Mary Fisher's mother almost takes as much joy out of wrecking Mary's perfect lifestyle as Ruth does, almost! And finally, I can't leave out the wonderful character Hooper played by Linda Hunt. Hooper is a dowdy old nurse-maid that helps Ruth start the business Vesta Rose for the harried and hopeless women of New York.",5,ROSEANNE IS A LAUGH RIOT,1133222400,"11 29, 2005",2005,1649,"['be', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', '80', 'Watch', 'out', 'when', 'Ruth', 'Patchett', 'played', 'queen', 'comedy', 'Roseanne', 'ticked', 'can', 'cause', 'lot', 'damage', 'worthless', 'excuse', 'husband', 'Bob', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'Jr.', 'center', 'Ruth', 'rage', 'comedy', 'revenge', 'Roseanne', 'character', 'better', 'no-good', 'husband', 'thinks', 'out', 'prove', 'wrong', 'how', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'way', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Mary', 'Fisher', 'character', 'totally', 'over-the-top', 'perfect', 'addition', 'already', 'campy', 'classic', 'Mary', 'Fisher', 'cross', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'Jackie', 'Collins.There', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'funny', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Perhaps', 'funniest', 'when', 'Bob', 'Ruth', 'home', 'party', 'beginning', 'film', 'Poor', 'Ruth', 'sit', 'back', 'seat', 'two-door', 'car', 'Mary', 'Fisher', 'front', 'next', 'husband', 'bum', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'common', 'decency', 'drive', 'Ruth', 'door', 'instead', 'dropping', 'off', 'block', 'away', 'house', 'was', 'also', 'hoot', 'when', 'Ruth', 'kids', 'Andy', 'Nicolette', 'Miss', 'Fisher', 'children', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'father', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Mary', 'Fisher', 'kooky', 'mother', 'Sylvia', 'Mills', 'senior', 'Mrs.', 'Fisher', 'such', 'comedy', 'finesse', 'Mary', 'Fisher', 'mother', 'almost', 'much', 'joy', 'wrecking', 'Mary', 'perfect', 'lifestyle', 'Ruth', 'almost', 'finally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'out', 'wonderful', 'character', 'Hooper', 'played', 'Linda', 'Hunt', 'Hooper', 'dowdy', 'old', 'nurse-maid', 'Ruth', 'start', 'business', 'Vesta', 'Rose', 'harried', 'hopeless', 'women', 'New', 'York']",N/A
151442,A3TZB9SXJCFMFJ,0792844726,J. Michael Click,"[6, 6]","Despite hilarious performances from Meryl Streep, Roseanne Barr, and Ed Begley, Jr., this film adaptation of Fay Weldon's ""The Life and Loves of a She-Devil"" is sure to disappoint viewers who were lucky enough to catch the earlier British mini-series based on the same novel.  The problem here is with the script, which doesn't really develop Roseanne's character as fully as it might.  In the television adaptation, Ruth Patchett was an even more pathetic and disempowered character whose plot of vengeance against her cheating husband and his mistress was carried out with a certain sense of reluctance and a twinge of regret.  This extra shading made Ruth more sympathetic and the comedy much, much darker.  Here the tone is lighter, sometimes veering off course into slapstick, such as the speeded-up sequence in which Roseanne and Linda Hunt remodel the building that will become their place of business.Still, as noted earlier, the cast is uniformly excellent.  Meryl Streep has a field day playing a manipulative homewrecking she-wolf dressed in (pink) lamb's clothing, and Roseanne is a hoot as the hopelessly frumpy housewife who finally decides she's mad as hell and isn't going to take it anymore.  Ed Begley, Jr., completes this unholy trio as the unlikely object of both women's desire.  Indeed, a lot of the fun comes from the incongruity of casting these three actors in the same movie.The DVD offers a crisp widescreen video transfer and generally excellent sound, and includes the Original Theatrical Trailer.  Definitely worth a look for the performances, but do keep your eye out for the mini-series, which hopefully will be released on DVD sometime in the future.",3,Heavenly Performances ...

Her husband, an accountant, lives a middle-aged life with two kids, a boy and a girl, and is attempting to move up in the socioeconomic scale.  He obviously married the wrong woman, however, because they do not appear to have much in common and he is not physically attracted to her.So, on mere happenstance, he bumps into a famous romance novelist at a party, greets her, and discovers that they both have something in common -- perhaps intelligence, in him, and beauty in her.  His wife, the slob, an imbecile, makes the mistake of making the romance novelist's dress dirty.  It was an accident.  The husband decides to take the romance novelist home.  He takes her home and they both make love.  There is love from the start.His wife notices things are wrong quite quickly.  First, although the husband was supposed to take the romance novelist home, he did not come home until the morning.  Second, he appears far more happy than he normally does.So he comes to the conclusion that a divorce is necessary, and he goes through with it.  He lives with the romance novelist for a while, but things get ugly: and here's the main part of the story.  The wife tries to ruin his life in any way that she can.

Barr starred in this funny film about an ugly, overweight women who discovers her husband is having an affair with a rich romance novelist named Mary Fisher, played to perfection by Meryl Streep, who wanted to do some lighter comedy roles. The movie is funny, surprising, and filled with a great acting ensemble of first-rate actors. I never thought Streep would ever be able to play comedy, but she is hilarious in the role, especially after Ruth dumps her children off at Mary's house for the husband and mistress to raise, turning Mary's life upside down. Then, Ruth seeks revenge on both of them by trying to destroy her husband's business accounts and Mary's perfect, idealic life as an innocent high-class writer by inquiring about her past. The scene where Ruth discovers Mary's forgotten mother in an old folks home is down-right funny, especially when Ruth is told by the old woman Mary was knocked up as a teenager and gave the child up for adoption. Then the old woman loses her false teeth while laughing! A Riot! Ed Begley is great as the hunky philandering husband and soap opera star and Emmy winner A Martinez plays a handsome poolboy in Mary's employ. The film runs 1 hour and 35 minutes long and comes with the trailer.
