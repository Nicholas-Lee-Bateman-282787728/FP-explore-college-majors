124593,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,0792110463,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[59, 63]","A  well written story of an aging, illiterate cow hand, &quot;Will Penny&quot; has a magnificent portrayal by Charlton Heston, who has been quoted as saying that he loved the script, and felt that it was his best performance; it is a subtle and very touching depiction of a man who is realistic about his fate, which is raw and bitter, but not entirely without humor.Set in the 1880s in Montana, it was shot on location  by cinematographer Lucien Ballard in Inyo National Forest, with sweeping panoramas of the Sierra Nevada.This film was sadly ignored when it was released in 1968; some say the disappointing reception was because &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; was running at the same time, but I'm inclined to believe it was because it didn't follow the Hollywood formula, in its characters or plot.The cast supporting Heston is superb, including a glowing performance by Joan Hackett, as a woman stranded with her son in the wilderness, and Jon Gris (son of director Tom Gris), is a delight as &quot;Button&quot;, her son.Donald Pleasence is appropriately manic as the murderous Preacher Quint, and in a small part as the Flat Iron Ranch Foreman, Ben Johnson truly shines. Other terrific actors in small parts are Bruce Dern, Anthony Zerbe, Lee Majors, Slim Pickens, and William Schallert as Dr. Fraker. Lydia Clarke (the real life Mrs. Heston) appears as Mrs. Fraker.Rather along the lines of Clint Eastwood's 1992 &quot;Unforgiven&quot;, this is an intelligent, beautifully directed and acted Western, with well-drawn characters, and a good balance between action scenes and the inner landscape of a lonely man.A must for Heston fans, and also for those who say they don't care for his acting, as this film could well change their minds.Total running time 1 hour and 50 minutes.",5,Heston's best,1085529600,"05 26, 2004",2004,1784,"['well', 'written', 'story', 'aging', 'illiterate', 'cow', 'hand', 'quot', 'Will', 'Penny', 'quot', 'magnificent', 'portrayal', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'who', 'been', 'quoted', 'saying', 'loved', 'script', 'felt', 'was', 'best', 'performance', 'subtle', 'very', 'touching', 'depiction', 'man', 'who', 'realistic', 'fate', 'raw', 'bitter', 'not', 'entirely', 'humor.Set', '1880s', 'Montana', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'cinematographer', 'Lucien', 'Ballard', 'Inyo', 'National', 'Forest', 'sweeping', 'panoramas', 'Sierra', 'Nevada.This', 'film', 'was', 'sadly', 'ignored', 'when', 'was', 'released', '1968', 'say', 'disappointing', 'reception', 'was', 'quot', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'quot', 'was', 'running', 'same', 'time', ""'m"", 'inclined', 'believe', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'Hollywood', 'formula', 'characters', 'plot.The', 'cast', 'supporting', 'Heston', 'superb', 'including', 'glowing', 'performance', 'Joan', 'Hackett', 'woman', 'stranded', 'son', 'wilderness', 'Jon', 'Gris', 'son', 'director', 'Tom', 'Gris', 'delight', 'quot', 'Button', 'quot', 'son.Donald', 'Pleasence', 'appropriately', 'manic', 'murderous', 'Preacher', 'Quint', 'small', 'part', 'Flat', 'Iron', 'Ranch', 'Foreman', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'truly', 'shines', 'Other', 'terrific', 'actors', 'small', 'parts', 'are', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'Anthony', 'Zerbe', 'Lee', 'Majors', 'Slim', 'Pickens', 'William', 'Schallert', 'Dr.', 'Fraker', 'Lydia', 'Clarke', 'real', 'life', 'Mrs.', 'Heston', 'Mrs.', 'Fraker.Rather', 'lines', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', '1992', 'quot', 'Unforgiven', 'quot', 'intelligent', 'beautifully', 'directed', 'acted', 'Western', 'well-drawn', 'characters', 'good', 'balance', 'action', 'scenes', 'inner', 'landscape', 'lonely', 'man.A', 'must', 'Heston', 'fans', 'also', 'who', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'acting', 'film', 'could', 'well', 'change', 'minds.Total', 'running', 'time', '1', 'hour', '50', 'minutes']",N/A

That is the usual claim made for movies that have little else going for them.  The definition of ""realistic"" relied on for such movies is: boring, dirty, and ends unhappily.  (That there are other aspects of reality does not seem to occur to them.)  So, all right, I give the movie a star for realism.  I can't give it a star for ""gripping"" because it isn't.  I can't give it a star for ""moving"" because it isn't.  I can't give it stars for photography, music or acting because these are adequate but not outstanding.Even the ""realistic"" claim won't stand scrutiny.  Are we supposed to believe that a seriously wounded man could walk through snow with no clothes on all the way back to the cabin?  Are we supposed to believe that these three stereotypical villains would wait two days for the lady to make up her mind?  Nonsense!  They'd rape her then and there.  Are we to believe that a real down-and-dirty cowpoke would turn down a beautiful woman?  This isn't realism.  This is chivalry!  This is a Romantic Hero!  And of course, the biggest cliche of all: the cavalry riding to the rescue at precisely the right moment--only in this case it is Will's two friends who have ridden for days and just happen to show up at the precise second that he needs them!The only reason to watch this film is to study it in contrast to Shane.  After all, the movie strains to be another Shane.  Why isn't it?  Why is Shane all of the above and more and this movie isn't?

A great cast, script and cinematography combine under able direction to portray the itinerant lifestyle of the cowboy against the eternal themes of love, hate and fate in frontier America. The films director/writer Tom Gries avoids the romanticised western tradition and the cartoon violence of the emerging spaghetti western genre to focus instead on character development and authentic human detail. Heston is simply superb in the main role of Will Penny an ageing illiterate cowboy `to smart to old' in search of ranch work in the wintertime. The supporting cast of familiar actors is also uniformly strong. Donald Pleasance in a trademark menacing role is mesmerising as the bible bashing preacher Quint, bent on his own style of slow revenge. Preacher Quint is one dude you just don't want to cross. Love interest is provided by the able Joan Hackett an abandoned mother who together with her young son are fated to seek male support in a an unforgiving environment.

""Daniel""","[7, 11]","Director Tom Gries is mostly known for the two movies,BreakoutandBreakheart Pass, he directed in 1975 for Charles Bronson at the peak of his career then. But this director, unlike the great majority of his contemporary colleagues of the end of the sixties, had the one in a lifetime opportunity to direct a script he had himself written and this movie was WILL PENNY, shot during the 1967-1968 winter.If, during the projection of the film, the viewer inevitably thinks about George Stevens'sShane, WILL PENNY nevertheless lives its own life and offers scenes that linger in the head, at least mine, for quite a while. First of all, I must say that the scenes between Charlton Heston and Joan Hackett are so bashful and true that I had to make an effort to remember that I was watching a western, the male cinematographic genre in essence. Secondly, I was captivated by the performance of Donald Pleasence who, as Preacher Quint, fills the screen with his magnetism as soon as he appears.

Frequently when he's not doing the big-budget historical epics, Heston's performances seem to be much more realistic.  WILL PENNY is a case in point....Aided by a solid script by director Tom Gries, who died too young in 1977, Heston gives a performance of real strength and character, with Hackett (who also died too young) equally fine as the lonely woman having to protect an emotionally fatherless son.  WILL PENNY was primarily shot on location in the Owens Valley, at the eastern foot of the Sierra Nevada, during the winter of 1967; and this results in a very cold but still panoramic movie, superbly shot by veteran cameraman Lucien Ballard.  For whatever reason, Paramount originally buried it in release in early 1968, choosing to release it simultaneously with the 20th Century Fox film PLANET OF THE APES, another Heston film that got the box office glory.

124608,A60PQSFWSQK8K,0792110463,Erik Rupp,"[32, 39]","For me, watching Will Penny was a very frustrating experience.  The performances of Charlton Heston, Lee Majors, Anthony Zerbe, and Ben Johnson were all quite good - especially Charlton Heston's.  The script is excellent in most areas, and the direction & photography are often inspired.  What goes wrong with Will Penny is the one part of the script that doesn't work.The villians of the story are so unbelievable and unrealistic that they seem like they came out of a Western spoof, rather than the serious, realistic Western which Will Penny attempts to be.  It's hard to figure just where the heck Donald Pleasance's character is supposed to come from as his accent is all over the place.  It's also hard to figure out just how this family of nut-jobs hadn't been killed long before they could encounter Will Penny.  They would have either been killed or jailed for their pattern of committing crimes based on their warped religious beliefs.

I found ""Will Penny"" on an internet search of popular westerns, and since I respect and admire Charlton Heston's work, I figured this would be a good film.  My assumptions were correct; this is a very good film, certainly not a classic by any means, but an entertaining one that held my interest from the opening scene to the last.  Heston plays Will Penny, an aging cowboy who lives a simple life trailing cattle.  His once simple life radically changes when he gets involved in a gunfight with a band of no-good scum led by a religious fanatic named Preacher Quint (wonderfully acted by Donald Pleasence).  Quint vows to kill Will Penny (for the death of one of his men) and comes very close to doing so.  Hurt badly and nearly dying, Penny falls into the care of a husbandless woman (Joan Hackett) and her son, who are wintering in a line shack in the wilderness.  Penny sees for the first time in his life what life would be like married and with a family.  He is torn to choose between his simple cowboy existence and becoming a married man.  I won't reveal the ending, but it is quite surprising.I truly enjoyed this story.  Heston acts like he is pining for an Academy Award.  He is truly brilliant in his role at Will Penny.

124620,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,0792110463,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[1, 1]","This is an excellent, although rather atypical and sad western - and I adored it! Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.Will Penny (Charlton Heston) is an aging cowboy who is hired by a rich cattle baron to ride the boundary of a ranch over the winter. When going to his remote mountain cabin he finds out that a woman, Catherine Allen (Joan Hackett) and her son Horace (Jon Gries) took refuge there, having been deserted by the guide that her husband paid in advance to bring her and her son to him.  Blocked by the snow in the mountains they are forced to spend the winter together.As if things were not already complicated enough, a certain Preacher Quint (Donald Pleasance), a slightly deranged low life vagrant (and definitely NOT a real pastor) who has a score to settle with Penny, wanders into the same mountains, together with his slightly mentally handicapped common law wife and his two brutish, not very bright sons Rufe and Rafe.This is an atypical western, telling ultimately a rather simple story of very ordinary people. In fact it is more a social drama than anything else. It is also a rather sad film, even if some merry and humoristic moments are also present - one of the best includes a philosophical debate about bathing...)))Towards the end of his life Charlton Heston stated that this was his most favourite of all the numerous films in which he played, as it doesn't tell the story of a prophet, prince, soldier or space explorer - no, this is the tale about a regular Joe (or rather Will) who never asked for much from life (and as result never got that much) but who may have just finally met the destiny which was meant for him all this time... He clearly loved playing Will Penny, so different of his usual characters - and the result is very pleasant on the screen. Also, how can one not root at least a little for a guy named Penny? Not Buck, not Dollar, not Quarter, not Dime, not even Nickel - just Penny...Joan Hackett performance is also remarkable. Her character is just a simple gal, who until now didn't really fare well in life and other than her little boy Horace she doesn't have much to take pride and comfort in. The betrayal of the guide and abandonment in the mountains was certainly a disaster for her - but to a certain extent it was also a liberation of sorts... It is a pleasure to watch her Catherine Allen coping with the hardships - and change when doing it.Donald Pleasance, the Great Hollywood Workaholic Supremo and Go-To-Guy When Freaks, Weirdoes, Psychos and Other Scum Need To Be Played, gives a GREAT show as half-mad Preacher Quint, the self-declared man of God and leader of small tribe of, well, basically cave men - it is just that those cave men ride horses and carry Winchesters... The guy is a vicious louse and his three (later two) sons are clearly bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh.

124622,AB5DVSNPX1JSK,0792110463,"Mr. Fisher ""grand_clown""","[3, 5]","Will Penny is a western that was very enjoyable to watch, it has its humor as well as dramatic moments.The story is so-so in originality.  Will Penny (Heston) is an old cow hand who knows nothing more but moving herds and working all his life.  Once his job is done, he takes up company with two of his friends and ends up making enemies with some rawhiders, led by a well performed character in Preacher Quint (D. Pleasance).  I thought this villain was both funny and evil.  Meanwhile, Penny stumbles upon a woman (J. Hackett) and son who are on their way to meet her husband in Oregon.  Well, I won't tell you everything, but I will say that Penny finds himself in a double quandry: he's falling in love with a married woman and he's being hunted by these rawhiders.Will Penny's character is witty, wise at times, and very human.  I think Heston does an outstanding job with this character.  Will Penny is believable and he's wholesome, you can't help but feel for him in this film.Joan Hackett's plays a great role with her character, as she comes across as opinionated yet humble, which leads to an attractive and engaging character.Donald Pleasance's character, Quint, is a looney who has the eyes of a wacko, which is why his villain character is great.  The best part is when he dances to an Irish gig later in the film.  It's rather humorous.These are the good points, but I haven't yet touched on the bad:1. The story line takes awhile to get going, there's a little too extra time with Penny and his two other cow hands.  I'm really not sure if they are characters worth having, the film could've moved along nicely without them.  Although Anthony Zerbe's character, Dutchy, is rather entertaining.2. Quint made such a great villain, more time with him would've been welcomed, or perhaps making him more of a thorn in Penny's side.  I guess I like the character so much, I wanted more scenes with him.3. There needed to be more bonding between Hackett and Heston's characters.  They played off each other rather well, too bad there weren't more scenes leading up to the drama/romance between them.4. The ending.  OK, I'm not going to go into it specifically, but I will say I didn't like it.  Maybe it was more realistic the way it ended, but come on, it could've been much much better.Overall, Will Penny is a fine western, is it the best?  No, not by a long shot.  A long beginning and the need for more character conflict is what keeps this movie at four stars.  I like it, I think you should see it, maybe even buy it, but don't go thinking it's the best western ever, cuz it ain't.Grade: B",4,A Penny to keep,1060819200,"08 14, 2003",2003,2605,"['Will', 'Penny', 'western', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'humor', 'as', 'well', 'dramatic', 'moments.The', 'story', 'so-so', 'originality', 'Will', 'Penny', 'Heston', 'old', 'cow', 'hand', 'who', 'nothing', 'more', 'moving', 'herds', 'working', 'life', 'job', 'done', 'up', 'company', 'two', 'friends', 'up', 'making', 'enemies', 'rawhiders', 'led', 'well', 'performed', 'character', 'Preacher', 'Quint', 'D.', 'Pleasance', 'thought', 'villain', 'was', 'funny', 'evil', 'Meanwhile', 'Penny', 'woman', 'J.', 'Hackett', 'son', 'who', 'are', 'way', 'meet', 'husband', 'Oregon', 'Well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'everything', 'will', 'say', 'Penny', 'double', 'quandry', 'falling', 'love', 'married', 'woman', 'being', 'hunted', 'rawhiders.Will', 'Penny', 'character', 'witty', 'wise', 'times', 'very', 'human', 'think', 'Heston', 'outstanding', 'job', 'character', 'Will', 'Penny', 'believable', 'wholesome', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'film.Joan', 'Hackett', 'great', 'role', 'character', 'opinionated', 'yet', 'humble', 'attractive', 'engaging', 'character.Donald', 'Pleasance', 'character', 'Quint', 'looney', 'who', 'eyes', 'wacko', 'why', 'villain', 'character', 'great', 'best', 'part', 'when', 'Irish', 'gig', 'later', 'film', 'rather', 'humorous.These', 'are', 'good', 'points', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'touched', 'bad:1', 'story', 'line', 'awhile', 'get', 'going', 'little', 'too', 'extra', 'time', 'Penny', 'two', 'other', 'cow', 'hands', ""'m"", 'really', 'not', 'sure', 'are', 'characters', 'worth', 'having', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'moved', 'along', 'nicely', 'Anthony', 'Zerbe', 'character', 'Dutchy', 'rather', 'entertaining.2', 'Quint', 'made', 'great', 'villain', 'more', 'time', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'welcomed', 'perhaps', 'making', 'more', 'thorn', 'Penny', 'side', 'guess', 'character', 'so', 'much', 'wanted', 'more', 'scenes', 'him.3', 'needed', 'be', 'more', 'bonding', 'Hackett', 'Heston', 'characters', 'played', 'off', 'other', 'rather', 'well', 'too', 'bad', 'were', ""n't"", 'more', 'scenes', 'leading', 'up', 'drama/romance', 'them.4', 'ending', 'OK', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'go', 'specifically', 'will', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'Maybe', 'was', 'more', 'realistic', 'way', 'ended', 'come', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'much', 'much', 'better.Overall', 'Will', 'Penny', 'fine', 'western', 'best', 'No', 'not', 'long', 'shot', 'long', 'beginning', 'need', 'more', 'character', 'conflict', 'what', 'movie', 'four', 'stars', 'think', 'should', 'see', 'maybe', 'even', 'buy', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'thinking', 'best', 'western', 'ever', 'cuz', ""ain't.Grade"", 'B']",N/A

124629,A2D63RN5LF14R2,0792110463,"THE BLUEMAHLER ""THE BLUEMAHLER""","[1, 2]","From 1956 on, actor Charlton Heston kept an actor&#8217;s journal, which he published in two volumes, in 1976 and 1996. These are some of the most fascinating and valuable behind-the-scene writings published on the subject of studio filmmaking. In addition to these writings, Heston was also an exceptional and underrated visual artist. Often, when actors turn to painting, the result is less than memorable, and can even be downright painful. One thinks of Henry Fonda&#8217;s vapid watercolors or the recent, execrable &#8220;world leader&#8221; portraits by George Bush as painful examples. Heston&#8217;s visual art was an extension of his journals. His pen and ink drawings of makeup artists, stuntmen, cameramen, and technicians celebrated the unsung blue-collar workers. I was fortunate enough to attend a small showing of Heston&#8217;s extensive work and it remains of the most compellingly unique exhibits I have attended to date.The story of the making of Will Penny (1968) is a standout entry in Heston&#8217;s &#8220;The Actor&#8217;s Life: Journals.&#8221; Heston was handed an incomplete script. Under normal conditions, the actor would have refused to read an unfinished screenplay, but Heston was so taken with the fragment that he immediately expressed interest in taking on the role of the aging, illiterate cowboy Will Penny. Heston was then informed that the writer, Tom Gries, was insistent on directing. When Heston inquired on Gries&#8217; directing experience, he found it consisted of &#8220;a couple of television programs.&#8221; Heston put up a mild protest, but quickly changed his mind upon learning that Gries&#8217; demand was unconditional. While it is fortunate that Heston compromised in what turned out to be one of his best and most underrated roles, his skepticism about Gries&#8217; lack of experience had some validity.The central performances and an intelligent, sensitive script are the strengths of Will Penny; however, Gries&#8217; television-like visual direction and an embarrassingly melodramatic performance from Donald Pleasance are noticeable flaws. As excellent as Heston&#8217;s work is here, Joan Hackett is even better. She imbues her part with an unglamorous freshness (Heston amusingly related that several actresses turned down the role upon reading the description of Catherine as plain). Heston later counted Hackett as the best of his leading ladies, and for good reason.Will Penny is not a Wyatt Earp type. He does not bravely face down the enemy to clean up a corrupt town. Rather, he is a fifty-year-old cowhand who works with cattle. It&#8217;s all he knows. He doesn&#8217;t even know how to write his name. When he gets into a fight with a younger co-worker, Penny uses a frying pan &#8220;because I use my hands to work.&#8221; When a trail job ends, Penny finds himself traveling with a young Lee Majors and Anthony Zerbe in hopes of finding work. Majors is a bit of a nonentity here, but Zerbe gives a very good performance as a recently transplanted, thickly accented European immigrant who awkwardly shoots himself and then milks every ounce of sympathy he can.Zerbe and Majors try to steal an elk from demented preacher Quint (Pleasance) and his sons (one of who is played by Bruce Dern in one of his worst and most cartoonish performances). Penny is inadvertently drawn into the conflict, which will have eventual and horrific consequences.The three men temporarily part company when Penny lands a seasonal job as a line rider. Penny finds his shack occupied by squatters in the person of Catherine (Hackett) and her young son (Jon Francis).The romance between Penny and Catherine is authentic. They do not wind up in each others&#8217; arms within thirty seconds. It is the building of the relationship between the two that gives Will Penny its substance. Even the inevitable conflict between Penny and Quint is in service of the understated chemistry between Heston and Hackett.While Gries&#8217; does not have the cinematic visual flair of the best directors, his strength lies in characterization and elegant writing. This was Gries&#8217; first feature film. His subsequent films were mere assignments, lacking the personal vision of Will Penny.",5,Vastly underrated (while still imperfect),1397692800,"04 17, 2014",2014,4224,"['1956', 'actor', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'kept', 'actor', '8217', 's', 'journal', 'published', 'two', 'volumes', '1976', '1996', 'are', 'most', 'fascinating', 'valuable', 'behind-the-scene', 'writings', 'published', 'subject', 'studio', 'filmmaking', 'addition', 'writings', 'Heston', 'was', 'also', 'exceptional', 'underrated', 'visual', 'artist', 'Often', 'when', 'actors', 'turn', 'painting', 'result', 'less', 'memorable', 'can', 'even', 'be', 'downright', 'painful', 'One', 'Henry', 'Fonda', '8217', 'vapid', 'watercolors', 'recent', 'execrable', '8220', 'world', 'leader', '8221', 'portraits', 'George', 'Bush', 'painful', 'examples', 'Heston', '8217', 'visual', 'art', 'was', 'extension', 'journals', 'pen', 'ink', 'drawings', 'makeup', 'artists', 'stuntmen', 'cameramen', 'technicians', 'celebrated', 'unsung', 'blue-collar', 'workers', 'was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'attend', 'small', 'showing', 'Heston', '8217', 'extensive', 'work', 'most', 'compellingly', 'unique', 'exhibits', 'have', 'attended', 'date.The', 'story', 'making', 'Will', 'Penny', '1968', 'standout', 'entry', 'Heston', '8217', '8220', 'Actor', '8217', 's', 'Life', 'Journals.', '8221', 'Heston', 'was', 'handed', 'incomplete', 'script', 'normal', 'conditions', 'actor', 'would', 'have', 'refused', 'read', 'unfinished', 'screenplay', 'Heston', 'was', 'so', 'taken', 'fragment', 'immediately', 'expressed', 'interest', 'taking', 'role', 'aging', 'illiterate', 'cowboy', 'Will', 'Penny', 'Heston', 'was', 'then', 'informed', 'writer', 'Tom', 'Gries', 'was', 'insistent', 'directing', 'When', 'Heston', 'inquired', 'Gries', '8217', 'directing', 'experience', 'found', 'consisted', '8220', 'couple', 'television', 'programs.', '8221', 'Heston', 'put', 'up', 'mild', 'protest', 'quickly', 'changed', 'mind', 'learning', 'Gries', '8217', 'demand', 'was', 'unconditional', 'fortunate', 'Heston', 'compromised', 'what', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'underrated', 'roles', 'skepticism', 'Gries', '8217', 'lack', 'experience', 'had', 'validity.The', 'central', 'performances', 'intelligent', 'sensitive', 'script', 'are', 'strengths', 'Will', 'Penny', 'however', 'Gries', '8217', 'television-like', 'visual', 'direction', 'embarrassingly', 'melodramatic', 'performance', 'Donald', 'Pleasance', 'are', 'noticeable', 'flaws', 'As', 'excellent', 'Heston', '8217', 's', 'work', 'here', 'Joan', 'Hackett', 'even', 'better', 'part', 'unglamorous', 'freshness', 'Heston', 'amusingly', 'related', 'several', 'actresses', 'turned', 'down', 'role', 'reading', 'description', 'Catherine', 'plain', 'Heston', 'later', 'counted', 'Hackett', 'best', 'leading', 'ladies', 'good', 'reason.Will', 'Penny', 'not', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'type', 'not', 'bravely', 'face', 'down', 'enemy', 'clean', 'up', 'corrupt', 'town', 'Rather', 'fifty-year-old', 'cowhand', 'who', 'cattle', '8217', 's', '8217', 'even', 'know', 'how', 'write', 'name', 'When', 'fight', 'younger', 'co-worker', 'Penny', 'frying', 'pan', '8220', 'use', 'hands', 'work.', '8221', 'When', 'trail', 'job', 'ends', 'Penny', 'traveling', 'young', 'Lee', 'Majors', 'Anthony', 'Zerbe', 'hopes', 'finding', 'work', 'Majors', 'bit', 'nonentity', 'here', 'Zerbe', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'recently', 'transplanted', 'thickly', 'accented', 'European', 'immigrant', 'who', 'awkwardly', 'shoots', 'then', 'milks', 'ounce', 'sympathy', 'Majors', 'try', 'steal', 'elk', 'demented', 'preacher', 'Quint', 'Pleasance', 'sons', 'one', 'who', 'played', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'one', 'worst', 'most', 'cartoonish', 'performances', 'Penny', 'inadvertently', 'drawn', 'conflict', 'will', 'have', 'eventual', 'horrific', 'consequences.The', 'three', 'men', 'temporarily', 'part', 'company', 'when', 'Penny', 'seasonal', 'job', 'line', 'rider', 'Penny', 'shack', 'occupied', 'squatters', 'person', 'Catherine', 'Hackett', 'young', 'son', 'Jon', 'Francis', '.The', 'romance', 'Penny', 'Catherine', 'authentic', 'do', 'not', 'wind', 'up', 'others', '8217', 'arms', 'thirty', 'seconds', 'building', 'relationship', 'two', 'Will', 'Penny', 'substance', 'Even', 'inevitable', 'conflict', 'Penny', 'Quint', 'service', 'understated', 'chemistry', 'Heston', 'Hackett.While', 'Gries', '8217', 'not', 'have', 'cinematic', 'visual', 'flair', 'best', 'directors', 'strength', 'characterization', 'elegant', 'writing', 'was', 'Gries', '8217', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'subsequent', 'films', 'were', 'mere', 'assignments', 'lacking', 'personal', 'vision', 'Will', 'Penny']",N/A

The scenes with Joan Hackett are wonderfully restrained, their hesitation touching as they both grapple with feelings that astonish them both. The supporting cast are wonderful: Donald Pleasence as a lunatic preacher, Bruce Dern as his menacing son; Lee Majors & Anthony Zerbe as Penny's temporary sidekicks; Roy Jenson who Penny beats up with his hat and a skillet - ""Hands are for work,"" Penny says; Slim Pickens as the chuck wagon cook; and Ben Johnson, dominating the screen in the 3 tiny scenes he's given. Script and direction by Tom Gries, cinematography by the great Lucien Ballard. Heston may be remembered for Ben Hur, The Ten Commandments & Planet of the Apes, but Will Penny is his finest achievement. Four stars only because I'm really a hard grader. Worth a look if you've never seen it, worth a second viewing if you've seen it before. Rent it for 3 bucks, own the DVD for 6.

Charleton Heston plays a quiet, ageing and illiterate cow-hand who's known only ranch work his whole life.Much of Will Penny is a realistic depiction of life in the West.  The drifting, seasonal aspect of cowboy life and the work involved in ranching.  Tom Gries does a great job with the script and Heston is excellent as Will Penny.This isn't an over the top action epic.  While there is a shoot out it's not the center of the tale really.  The center of the tale is instead the character of Will Penny.  Donald Pleasance is great as the slightly psychotic preacher/thief.

It doesn't depend on needless violence-but there is violence. It seems like a real story. And it portrays that living in those days was no picnic. The harshness of life is there. The scenery is just gorgeous, yet it also is obvious that it was a pretty rugged existence to live there in those mountains. Heston's Will Penny is sensitive and kind. He's no push-over though. He can defend himself pretty well-suggesting that he might have done that a lot when he was young. He knows his limitations. Perhaps his best days are behind him-and he knows it. Yet, he has a quiet resignation about it. He doesn't aspire to greatness-he just wants to live his days out. He is an ""old man"" for his day. Probably never thinking he would find love- he finds it. Should he dare love? Should he be vulnerable? Then there is the evil-the ""preacher"" and his family. How will they change things for Will Penny?

He runs afoul of a family of psychotic rawhiders who leave him to die in the wilderness. Half-dead, he stumbles back to the line rider's cabin where he is nursed to health by a woman (Joan Hackett) and her boy who are wintering there en route to Oregon to meet her homesteading husband. Penny discovers love and a sense of family for the first time in his nigh fifty years of life.""Will Penny"" gives the viewer a good peek at what it must have really been like to be a cowboy out West in the late 1800s. Needless to say, the lifestyle is anything but glamorous.Most everything works great here: locations, cast, story, writing, etc. with three exceptions: The score is boring & dated. In the 60s there were numerous great Western scores that stood the test of time (""Duel at Diablo,"" ""Bandolero!,"" ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,"" ""MacKenna's Gold"" and ""The Magnificent Seven,"" to name a few), but the score to ""Penny"" is a badly-aged dud. (Then again, it DOES fit the film's main theme).Also, the villains are somewhat contrived. Donald Pleasence is impressive as the over-the-top psycho patriarch of the rawhiding family and Bruce Dern is always reliable as a villain, but -- I don't know -- this whole side plot just seems tacked on to supply action and menace to a story that might have been better without it.The heart of the story is Penny's first-time discovery of love and a sense of family. It's implied in the story that he was an orphan as a child and simply fell into the loner cowboy lifestyle to survive. He has never known true love or had a real sense of family. Before meeting Joan Hackett's character, Catherine, his experiences with women were limited to shallow hook-ups with prostitutes.Penny discovers he has a knack for fatherhood and likes it. The boy clearly looks up to him and loves him.It's almost as if God sees Penny's true noble character through all the grime and gruff cowboy exterior and throws him a pot of gold in the form of the love of Catherine and her boy. Will he take advantage of this opportunity of happiness and fulfillment, despite the risks? Will he even recognize it as an opportunity?[SPOILER ALERT!! THIS NEXT PARAGRAPH REVEALS THE ENDING!!]Unfortunately, even though he's a good man (generally speaking), Penny has no faith in love or life in general, no doubt because of his past experiences. Catherine gently points out that love will find a way, but Will insists that love cannot survive  the cold harsh realities of life and aging, in particular in the uncaring Western wilderness. Thus Penny walks away from what is likely his last chance at love, fatherhood and family. Although this ending is realistic (not all experiences in life end on a happy note), it's frankly a bit sad. According to the film love does NOT conquer all and the viewer is left feeling a tad deflated. It goes without saying that this is NOT a life & faith affirming film. One's last impression of Penny is that he's a pathetic loser who lacks the brains and oomph to throw caution to the wind and take advantage of a great opportunity for happiness.[END SPOILER]FINAL ANALYSIS: I detract 1 Star for the pizzazz-less score, the forced villain subplot and the ending. Otherwise this is a stellar picture.
