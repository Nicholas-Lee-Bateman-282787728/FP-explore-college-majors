False happenings that seemed like were big deals were actually not important. The reason I started watching The Event from the start was it was so shrouded in mystery that it actually looked interesting. First of all, there's Sean Walker, who's girlfriend gets kidnapped and he has to save her. That only lasted five episodes. Hal Holbrook plays this evil guy named Dempsey who WAS NEVER EXPLAINED. And there's Blake Sterling and the president. At the beginning of the show, Blake was a bad guy, and then he just turns into a good guy? This show makes absoulutely no sense. And yet, it had so much potential. A story about aliens that look like humans living among us secretely trying to kill us is such an awesome idea, but it just doesn't go anywhere. As for the actual Event, not expalined. A one-sentence teaser about it is given in the last episode. The Event ended with a shocker, but also a MAJOR cliffhanger. The way it slowly trickles out information makes this show not worth watching.",2,Never worked as well as it should have...,1312934400,"08 10, 2011",2011,1081,"['Event', 'was', 'annoying', 'Everytime', 'thought', 'was', 'about', 'go', 'somewhere', 'did', ""n't"", 'False', 'happenings', 'seemed', 'were', 'big', 'deals', 'were', 'actually', 'not', 'important', 'reason', 'started', 'watching', 'Event', 'start', 'was', 'was', 'so', 'shrouded', 'mystery', 'actually', 'looked', 'interesting', 'First', 'all', 'Sean', 'Walker', 'who', 'girlfriend', 'kidnapped', 'save', 'only', 'lasted', 'five', 'episodes', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'evil', 'guy', 'named', 'Dempsey', 'who', 'WAS', 'NEVER', 'EXPLAINED', 'Blake', 'Sterling', 'president', 'beginning', 'show', 'Blake', 'was', 'bad', 'guy', 'then', 'just', 'good', 'guy', 'show', 'absoulutely', 'sense', 'yet', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'story', 'aliens', 'look', 'humans', 'living', 'secretely', 'trying', 'kill', 'such', 'awesome', 'idea', 'just', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere', 'actual', 'Event', 'not', 'expalined', 'one-sentence', 'teaser', 'given', 'last', 'episode', 'Event', 'ended', 'shocker', 'also', 'MAJOR', 'cliffhanger', 'way', 'slowly', 'out', 'information', 'show', 'not', 'worth', 'watching']",The Event: The Complete Series

Usually it takes a number of seasons for this to occur with a series, like it did with ""24"".The plot is this: people from another planet crashed here years ago.  They look like us but they do not age much plus they are vastly ahead scientifically. Some of them were caught and imprisoned and others were blended into society over the decades, often in positions of power within the government. The leader of this group is a middle aged woman named Sophia. She has been in prison.  Her two sons have been free on the outside.  Simon is inside the government in a high level law enforcement job.  Thomas is a roving agent, who steps in when needed to keep things on course, like giving us the atomic bomb during World War 2.  Over the years Thomas has changed, becoming more militant and wanting to free his people.Added to this are a whole bunch of other characters with Jason Ritter in the hero role as the boyfriend of one of these aliens.  Except she doesn't know she is an alien because her father was one and he had children with a non-alien. Ritter is supposedly the one who will save the planet and he finds a rogue federal agent to assist him. We also meet the President and all of his advisers and watch them try to deal with this crisis.I think where this show went wrong was that it wrote the most interesting character out of the show.  This was Thomas, Sophia's son.  He was a fascinating character and although he was initially a villain, you came to see him as seriously conflicted. Jason Ritter should have been the most interesting character but his is a one note performance which gets tiresome.  He reminded me of the Jack Bauer role in ""24"" where we watch him try to save the world week after week in a dogged, tireless, one dimensional style.When I heard this had been cancelled, I thought the right decision was made.

1436573,A36CDTPDMHWMJ,B0051GOB2G,G. M. Curtis,"[47, 50]","I watched most of this series on tv then got the dvd to rewatch it and catch up on the pieces I missed.It's an excellent series, suspense and sci fi mixed well together in a tale that spans the globe and the years. And if it has one strength to shine above all the others for me, its the characterizations. The show goes to great lengths to show the mighty falling at every step of the way. The president, young and idealistic, slowly being broken down and turned into a paranoid and desperate man who will do anything to protect his country. The leader of the aliens, a woman who starts off near saintly, torn apart by events including the death of her son and the unexpected approaching destruction of her race, turning into a mass murderer. Yet even as it brings the mighty down it raises the humble, with an assassin being slowly transformed into a hero, a paranoic head of security being shown as paranoid for a reason and even learning to trust. The acting is superb.There are however two weaknesses for me. The first is the unecessary way the plot jumps through time periods.I don't mind the odd flash back, but at the beginning the show is all flashbacks, and I found myself constantly being jerked out of my comfort zone as I tried to work out where and when I was. It interrupts the flow of the story.The second are some strange plot hole issues. (Warning some spoilers ahead). First the pilot of the plane. Since any plane and any pilot would do why would the bad guys kidnap the daughter's of an alien on Earth to do it, and in so doing create a mess for themselves? It seems contrived and unecessarily complicated, though of course if it hadn't happened, the story's main character and plot couldn't happen.There is also the issue of the defenders of humanity, who it turns the initial bad guy is one of. I don't have a problem with a secret underground resistence opposing an alien threat, that's fine. I do have a problem with them fighting an alien race with uber technology, with mystic knowledge, ancient scrolls and moving pieces of stone representing people(?) on a strange stone tablet of future events. Its just wrong.And then there's the major plot hole. When the alien's go mad and start planning the death of humanity, its all so that apparently the Earth will have room for their two and a half billion people. A strange reason but still a reason. Then right at the end (Major spoiler), they bring their entire world across and set it up somewhere out there in Earth's orbit.

These &#34;sleepers&#34; are aliens from that ship that have integrated themselves into modern day society.  Their DNA is less than 1% different from regular humans, and look, talk, and act almost exactly identical to us. Some have even made it as far as the White House.As the story unravels, you learn more of how long they have been alive, and even on planet earth. They age extremely slowly, and are extremely smart and technologically advanced.  You become to get attached to the &#34;aliens&#34; and find yourself torn between who to &#34;root&#34; for quite frequently.Never before have I seen a show that had me on the edge of my seat, biting my nails (which I have never done!), and pushing play on my DVD player as fast as I can, and not being able to sleep because I was thinking about what was going to happen.

1436583,A28QU1UG32PYNV,B0051GOB2G,"Katie A. E. ""Words-at-war""","[1, 2]","The Event starts off with a bang. Literally. We begin with the integral characters of the story, Sean Walker (Jason Ritter) hijacking a plane, trying to find out why his girlfriend Leila Buchanan (Sarah Roemer) has gone missing during their romantic cruise. This leads to unbelievable and unimaginable revelations...like the conspiracy of the 66 mysterious captives held in an off the grid and classified Alaskan compound since the 1940s and the plot to kill the president of the US. And it's almost all done in flashbacks.Like many, back when this series was on TV, I watched and quickly lost interest by the middle part of the season. When it was put into DVD format, I checked it out and remembered all the little reasons I lost interest. I love high-concept, fast-paced and overly complicated series (a la Flashforward 24, Lost, etc) that asks the viewers to do more than just sit back and mindlessly enjoy, and quickly forget, what they just watched. However, I don't enjoy watching TV shows that continually ask you to believe in plot lines that don't make any sense at all or to watch characters do stupid things that don't make any sense at all. It gets so frustrating and tedious.The problem with The Event is that the writers boxed themselves into corners with the plot, which had more holes than a sieve and became more complicated than was needed. While there is a lot of action and things move along, it felt static. It lost its excitement and tried too hard every week to outdo the previous episode. The coherency and general believability is lost by the middle, as revelations become more outlandish and the big 'ta-das' that had me go 'huh?' rather than 'wow'. After awhile, I didn't care and all the revelations felt empty, confusing or nonsensical. The narrative, while daring, gets annoying. The only thing really elevates this particular series is the performances by the entire cast, both the main and secondary actors. The cast was expansive, diverse and full of heavy-hitting and established names like Blair Underwood, Laura Innes, Bill Smitrovich and Zeljko Ivanek but it wasn't enough to make something out of nothing. Everything else, left to be desired.

This will mark you as a moral person.I will always find you (sob)- even though he was the one to walk away and found her only by coincidence.If people have been trying to kill you and you find yourself safe, why not assert your right to go for a walk outside the safe zone and have a whiny tantrum when you find out someone is keeping guard over you. If he is a nicely dressed, smiling man, scream at him that you don't feel safe. Later, kill him.Police stations are easy to break out of. Go into the bathroom and smash the window, no one has ever tried that before.Gunshot wounds heal in hours and do not significantly inhibit movement. The next day you will have a limp but don't worry, it will only be intermittent.A group of aliens wants to infect humans with a deadly virus.  Of all the deadly viruses out there they chose the Spanish Flu-worse in some unspecified way.  They keep saying that it killed 25% of earth's population in 1918.  Yeah. When food was scarce, people were poor, hygiene was basic and ANTIBIOTICS did not exist.  Hmm. Wonder if that makes a difference?A star goes supernova over a few decades.  It was completely unexpected.A person with the flu should not be allowed to sleep or they might die.A pretty girl can do anything if she whinges loudly enough.

At the beginning of the series there appear to be two main storylines, though these converge and reorganize later as the characters interact. The more grown-up political storyline with the president and Sophia is full of great mature actors while the Sean and Layla storyline really tends to be groanworthy. With better actors, a few better writers, and a few decisions made differently this probably could have been a great show. It can be very enjoyable for people who like television and don't mind overlooking flaws. Because you will have to do that constantly. The Sophia storyline in particular will appeal to people who like a good character-driven suspenseful story. Sophia's character is one of the best I've seen on television. I think without Laura Innes the show wouldn't have been worth watching, though Blair Underwood's incompetent president character is pretty compelling himself. Zeljko Ivanek's NSA director seems like a drone at first but is revealed to be a complex and thoughtful character -- one of the show's best.I'm starting to ramble, so I'll wrap this up by saying this is a good show for people who:1) don't mind very obvious imperfection2) enjoy scifi, mystery, thrillers, character-driven stories3) don't mind shows that get canceled after one season and are left with a cruel cliffhanger",3,How can something be so good and so bad at the same time?,1385942400,"12 2, 2013",2013,1374,"['hard', 'write', 'review', 'show', 'one', 'beginning', 'series', 'there', 'appear', 'be', 'two', 'main', 'storylines', 'converge', 'reorganize', 'later', 'characters', 'interact', 'more', 'grown-up', 'political', 'storyline', 'president', 'Sophia', 'full', 'great', 'mature', 'actors', 'Sean', 'Layla', 'storyline', 'really', 'be', 'groanworthy', 'better', 'actors', 'few', 'better', 'writers', 'few', 'decisions', 'made', 'differently', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'show', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'people', 'who', 'television', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'overlooking', 'flaws', 'will', 'have', 'do', 'constantly', 'Sophia', 'storyline', 'particular', 'will', 'appeal', 'people', 'who', 'good', 'character-driven', 'suspenseful', 'story', 'Sophia', 'character', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'television', 'think', 'Laura', 'Innes', 'show', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'worth', 'watching', 'Blair', 'Underwood', 'incompetent', 'president', 'character', 'pretty', 'compelling', 'Zeljko', 'Ivanek', 'NSA', 'director', 'drone', 'first', 'revealed', 'be', 'complex', 'thoughtful', 'character', 'one', 'show', 'best.I', ""'m"", 'starting', 'ramble', ""'ll"", 'wrap', 'up', 'saying', 'good', 'show', 'people', 'who:1', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'very', 'obvious', 'imperfection2', 'enjoy', 'scifi', 'mystery', 'thrillers', 'character-driven', 'stories3', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'shows', 'get', 'canceled', 'one', 'season', 'are', 'left', 'cruel', 'cliffhanger']",The Event: The Complete Series

That's fine for a sit com but when you're trying to tell a story that has a massive amount of background and these things all tie in together it can get a bit wonky.Characters were killed off and replaced, the theme of telling the story outside of chronological order seemed to abruptly stop in one episode, leaving a couple of things left out (how did Jason Ritter get on the plane that he hijacked?  How did he know that it was her dad that was flying it?  I may have missed it, but I'm not going to insult anyone's intelligence by saying that it would have been told later on).The show crumbled into bad sci-fi/espionage by about the end.
