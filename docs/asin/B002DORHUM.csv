The songs are good, but the whole thing just doesn't seem to touch like most. I did enjoy Jimmy Dean. Bless his heart, it was good to see him. Lynda Randall does a great job on 'His Eye is on the Sparrow.' I would like to have had Ben Speer finish 'Til the Storm Passes By. It would have made it more special to me. Nothing wrong with the Booth Brothers, but the song is really serious, and I would have preferred that, as Ben started it, he finish it. Maybe I am just silly.
