The only down side is, I wish they would have gone into more detail about the main character Mr Walmsley. He was at one time associated with a psychiatric wing affiliated with the VA. They just never explain his entire past. Over all not a bad movie.",5,Surprisngly good film,1323993600,"12 16, 2011",2011,352,"['am', 'waiting', 'arrive', 'have', 'watched', 'Net-Flix', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'only', 'down', 'side', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'more', 'detail', 'main', 'character', 'Mr', 'Walmsley', 'was', 'one', 'time', 'associated', 'psychiatric', 'wing', 'affiliated', 'VA', 'just', 'never', 'explain', 'entire', 'past', 'not', 'bad', 'movie']",N/A

It's a very entertaining movie, it contains nudity so anyone that may be offended by this should not watch it. But it is a different kind of movie, has humor as well as drama. I really love this movie and don't let the bad cover picture fool you.I recommend this to anyone who doesn't like mainstream movies.Hope you enjoy it as much as I do!",4,Great obscure movie.,1316217600,"09 17, 2011",2011,463,"['Learning', 'Curve', 'great', 'little', 'movie', 'what', 'teachers', 'would', 'really', 'like', 'do', 'students', 'could', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'nudity', 'so', 'anyone', 'may', 'be', 'offended', 'should', 'not', 'watch', 'different', 'kind', 'movie', 'humor', 'as', 'well', 'drama', 'really', 'love', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'bad', 'cover', 'picture', 'fool', 'you.I', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'mainstream', 'movies.Hope', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'do']",N/A
770715,A2H4AWIOK1REMX,B0000B3FCC,"J. C Clark ""eanna""","[6, 9]","And this is the weakest. This film began some years ago as Detention, a black black-comedy with lots of gritty raw footage. A movie that grabbed you by the lapels and shook you, it precluded all mealy-mouthed hem-hawing about good and evil. But that same year, another film with the same name was released, and this Detention got lost. Andy recut it, chopped about 30 minutes, gave it a new name, and offered Very Special Ed, a brilliant, scathing, frightening movie that worked in every direction. I had thought the original unimprovable. I was wrong.But now he has recut it again, and it is diminished by the newest rearrangements. Some scenes were (I think) reshot, and they seem curiously without energy, as if everyone felt they had done this once already. The forcefulness is lost, and the new ending, while similar to the previous versions, again, comes out a bit tepid.A wonderful film is in here, this just isn't it. Still pretty good, with some flashes that are so good they shake you (e.g. the now shortened assembly scene where the teachers are learning just how many times they are supposed to look at a student) but overall, a notch below its previous lives.One wishes it success, but the disappointment of seeing something wonderful reduced, for whatever reasons, is saddening.",3,I've seen all 3 versions of this film,1102636800,"12 10, 2004",2004,1292,"['weakest', 'film', 'began', 'years', 'ago', 'Detention', 'black', 'black-comedy', 'lots', 'gritty', 'raw', 'footage', 'movie', 'grabbed', 'lapels', 'shook', 'precluded', 'mealy-mouthed', 'hem-hawing', 'good', 'evil', 'same', 'year', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'was', 'released', 'Detention', 'got', 'lost', 'Andy', 'recut', 'chopped', '30', 'minutes', 'gave', 'new', 'name', 'offered', 'Very', 'Special', 'Ed', 'brilliant', 'scathing', 'frightening', 'movie', 'worked', 'direction', 'had', 'thought', 'original', 'unimprovable', 'was', 'wrong.But', 'now', 'recut', 'again', 'diminished', 'newest', 'rearrangements', 'scenes', 'were', 'think', 'reshot', 'seem', 'curiously', 'energy', 'everyone', 'felt', 'had', 'done', 'once', 'already', 'forcefulness', 'lost', 'new', 'ending', 'similar', 'previous', 'versions', 'again', 'out', 'bit', 'tepid.A', 'wonderful', 'film', 'here', 'just', ""n't"", 'Still', 'pretty', 'good', 'flashes', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'shake', 'e.g', 'now', 'shortened', 'assembly', 'scene', 'where', 'teachers', 'are', 'learning', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'are', 'supposed', 'look', 'student', 'overall', 'notch', 'previous', 'lives.One', 'success', 'disappointment', 'seeing', 'something', 'wonderful', 'reduced', 'reasons', 'saddening']",N/A
770716,A2GY1RFRDDWFEO,B0000B3FCC,"Kevin ""fictionfan""","[0, 0]","....then this is it.The film is about a teacher who has had enough of uncivil students and their bad behavior including the use of vulgar language, harassment, threats and rudeness in a system that has failed just about everyone. The teacher constructs an elaborate scheme to teach his troubled students a lesson once and for all. Under his control, the students will be forced to learn or suffer the consequences.Some of the scenes are very satisfying to watch. Probably many teachers were cheering this on. A lot of it though is very unrealistic and you have to take it with a grain of salt. You have to just go along for the ride.The film is low budget and slightly amateurish. There are a couple of scenes where the dialogue didn't match the movement of the actor's mouths. There are times when the production is cheap and it's a bit hard to take however, most people who like comedy or something offbeat will enjoy this. It's worth seeing.",4,If you are looking for something different....,1273363200,"05 9, 2010",2010,944,"['.then', 'it.The', 'film', 'teacher', 'who', 'had', 'uncivil', 'students', 'bad', 'behavior', 'including', 'use', 'vulgar', 'language', 'harassment', 'threats', 'rudeness', 'system', 'failed', 'just', 'everyone', 'teacher', 'elaborate', 'scheme', 'teach', 'troubled', 'students', 'lesson', 'once', 'control', 'students', 'will', 'be', 'forced', 'learn', 'suffer', 'consequences.Some', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'satisfying', 'watch', 'Probably', 'many', 'teachers', 'were', 'cheering', 'lot', 'very', 'unrealistic', 'have', 'take', 'grain', 'salt', 'have', 'just', 'go', 'along', 'ride.The', 'film', 'low', 'budget', 'slightly', 'amateurish', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'where', 'dialogue', 'did', ""n't"", 'match', 'movement', 'actor', 'mouths', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'production', 'cheap', 'bit', 'hard', 'take', 'however', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'comedy', 'something', 'offbeat', 'will', 'enjoy', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

I highly recommend this movie to anyone that has dealt with bullys in thier life.,4,Guilty pleasure,1164585600,"11 27, 2006",2006,241,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'bullys', 'very', 'different', 'way', 'bet', 'got', 'snickers', 'teachers', 'watched', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'dealt', 'bullys', 'thier', 'life']",N/A
770718,AOL6BG6SAFGQF,B0000B3FCC,Rufus Quail,"[1, 1]","Our system of education does not adequately serve some students who are potentially the most capable.  There is a sizeable subset of students for whom a school is little more than a holding facility that frees both parents to have careers (or at least get the kids out of their hair for a few hours).  A student who is especially inquisitive, an abstract thinker, a dreamer, or just too smart, will only pose problems.You get the impression that Learning Curve (aka Detention) was written by a teacher or someone close to a teacher.  It is a satirical look at a system gone wrong.  An incident that figures strongly is the (supposedly real-life) case of a self-appointed ""book review committee"" that gets a textbook banned for ""encouraging creativity,"" leaving Mr. Walmsley's class with no book to study.  Mr. Walmsley is our caring lesson-provider who devises an unconventional scheme for dealing with student apathy.A glance at the DVD case lets you know it's a low-budget B movie with a cast of unknowns.  What are the chances this movie will be any good?  Well, if you don't take chances as a consumer of entertainment, you will never be pleasantly surprised.  This movie is surprisingly good.The movie goes in a different direction than you think it will and the ending is worth hanging around for.  There are moments of dry humor such as when the ""students"" discuss fiscal policy.  There is a memorable scene when a ""student"" reads aloud from Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness.""Afterward, I googled Andy Anderson, the director, to discover more hidden gems.
