The series was made forty years ago, but the complete episodes must exist somewhere.  When you buy a series you expect to get it complete-- not a shortened syndicated version like those tailored to cable TV networks. I think seasons one and two are complete, although I am not sure. This set of season three should have been at least as good as those if not better.It would have been nice if the DVD's would come in cases that would hold them securely in place.  The slim cases are in a sleeve which makes the set compact for easy storage, but you have to be very careful to avoid scratching the discs when taking them out and putting them back.It's great to have the third season, but I think this DVD set could have offered us more.  The price wasn't bad, but still one feels as if we could have received more for our money.  Since there aren't any bonus features, at least they could have given us complete programs.",3,"Great third season, but why aren't the episodes complete?",1196553600,"12 2, 2007",2007,1055,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'episodes', 'third', 'season', 'wondered', 'why', 'were', 'edited', 'several', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'pointed', 'out', 'series', 'was', 'made', 'forty', 'years', 'ago', 'complete', 'episodes', 'must', 'exist', 'somewhere', 'When', 'buy', 'series', 'expect', 'get', 'complete', 'not', 'shortened', 'syndicated', 'version', 'tailored', 'cable', 'TV', 'networks', 'think', 'seasons', 'one', 'two', 'are', 'complete', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'set', 'season', 'three', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'least', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'DVD', 'would', 'come', 'cases', 'would', 'hold', 'securely', 'place', 'slim', 'cases', 'are', 'sleeve', 'set', 'compact', 'easy', 'storage', 'have', 'be', 'very', 'careful', 'avoid', 'scratching', 'discs', 'when', 'taking', 'out', 'putting', 'back.It', 'great', 'have', 'third', 'season', 'think', 'DVD', 'set', 'could', 'have', 'offered', 'more', 'price', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'still', 'one', 'feels', 'could', 'have', 'received', 'more', 'money', 'are', ""n't"", 'bonus', 'features', 'least', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'complete', 'programs']",Mission: Impossible - The Third TV Season

1097253,A2F7CCPK4QL359,B000UX6TJI,"Bennet Pomerantz ""Bennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD""","[15, 17]","I enjoy Mission Impossible. It was a show that was a throwback  to the 1960's cold war. Note in this shows and TV in this era, computers filled a room and  cel phones were not around as a mass market item. This show was not in real time like the show 24, but moved as quick as an episdode of 24. The way Mission was done was like a mini action thriller.The third season of Mission Impossible , the last with Barbara Bain and Martin Landau, showcased a faster paced show than the first two seasons. The episodes and the cast seems to mesh better this season then the first two seasons. The show was finding its style in its previous seasons. In this season collection, the show found its voice.Peter Graves is the mastermind leader, Jim Phelps. Landau is Rollin Hand,an actor  who can mimic anyone with a plastic mask. Greg Morris played Barney, Electrical genius (note his son Phil played the electrical genuis in the 1980's Mission Impossible TV remake). Peter Lupus is Willie, strong man who can lift anything and does. Bain, who won Emmys playing  Cinnamon Carter, is a beauty with a brain.On the DVD box, it says some of these shows are edited. I would assume Paramount could not find the original master recordings in their vaults and had to use the syndicated episodes of the show. These shows  were shaved for a few minutes to fit into a repeat schedule. Some of these shows have not seen air in years, since these shows have been in the vault.There are no dvd  extrasin this collection, like commentary, interviews or season overview shorts. One could wish the remaining cast of Graves. Lupis, Bain or Oscar winner Landau would say something. Sorry to say this, it did not come to pass.I will say this, even edited these syndicated versions of this Mission rocks and seem complete to meSo your mission is to get this collection and enjoy this action adventure!Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD",5,"Mission editted, but still good",1198022400,"12 19, 2007",2007,1895,"['enjoy', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'was', 'show', 'was', 'throwback', '1960', 'cold', 'war', 'Note', 'shows', 'TV', 'era', 'computers', 'filled', 'room', 'cel', 'phones', 'were', 'not', 'around', 'mass', 'market', 'item', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'real', 'time', 'show', '24', 'moved', 'as', 'quick', 'episdode', '24', 'way', 'Mission', 'was', 'done', 'was', 'mini', 'action', 'thriller.The', 'third', 'season', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'last', 'Barbara', 'Bain', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'showcased', 'faster', 'paced', 'show', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'episodes', 'cast', 'mesh', 'better', 'season', 'then', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'show', 'was', 'finding', 'style', 'previous', 'seasons', 'season', 'collection', 'show', 'found', 'voice.Peter', 'Graves', 'mastermind', 'leader', 'Jim', 'Phelps', 'Landau', 'Rollin', 'Hand', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'mimic', 'anyone', 'plastic', 'mask', 'Greg', 'Morris', 'played', 'Barney', 'Electrical', 'genius', 'note', 'son', 'Phil', 'played', 'electrical', 'genuis', '1980', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'TV', 'remake', 'Peter', 'Lupus', 'Willie', 'strong', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'lift', 'anything', 'Bain', 'who', 'won', 'Emmys', 'playing', 'Cinnamon', 'Carter', 'beauty', 'brain.On', 'DVD', 'box', 'shows', 'are', 'edited', 'would', 'assume', 'Paramount', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'original', 'master', 'recordings', 'vaults', 'had', 'use', 'syndicated', 'episodes', 'show', 'shows', 'were', 'shaved', 'few', 'minutes', 'fit', 'repeat', 'schedule', 'shows', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'air', 'years', 'shows', 'have', 'been', 'are', 'dvd', 'extrasin', 'collection', 'commentary', 'interviews', 'season', 'overview', 'shorts', 'One', 'could', 'wish', 'remaining', 'cast', 'Graves', 'Lupis', 'Bain', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Landau', 'would', 'say', 'something', 'Sorry', 'say', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'pass.I', 'will', 'say', 'even', 'edited', 'syndicated', 'versions', 'Mission', 'rocks', 'seem', 'complete', 'meSo', 'mission', 'get', 'collection', 'enjoy', 'action', 'adventure', 'Bennet', 'Pomerantz', 'AUDIOWORLD']",Mission: Impossible - The Third TV Season

I was too young to appreciate the intricate plots when it first aired in the 1960's but I've bought the first two seasons already and I'm addicted. I own a lot of TV shows on DVD and this is the first season set I've viewed completely. I, too wish they would add some extras, but I'm just delighted at the restoration process they used to clean up a show that's 40 years old. Picture quality and the remastered soundtrack are pristine! They look better than shows produced in the last 5 years, especially on a big screen. Unlike other studios (yes I'm talking to you, FOX and MGM)Paramount has respect for it's classic old shows.

1097262,A2MNB9PF4QMK9P,B000UX6TJI,"givbatam3 ""givbatam3""","[82, 85]","It was in season 3 that the show reached it peak. One outstanding episode after another. And what is really remarkable was that this was in the midst of a major behind-the-scenes power struggle that could have destroyed the series.  The original pair that wrote many of the scripts and basically determined which ideas would be used were William Read Woodfield and Alan Balter. However, in the middle of the filming of the third season, they got into a major confrontation with series creator Bruce Geller and abruptly left the show which was in the midst of production without any scripts for upcoming shows. In a panic, the writer Paul Playdon, a young writer only in his 20's came on board and cranked out a series of really outstanding stories and supervised others which were written by other writers.  Playdon's stories often (but not always) use a lot of fancy gadgetry which I like. This is seen in episodes like ""The Bunker"" and ""The Glass Cage"". On the other hand, his most cerebral episode, ""The Mind of Stefan Miklos"", has no action and no gadgetry and yet is one of the finest hours of television ever produced with some outstanding acting by Martin Landau and guest star Steve Ihnat. In this one, the viewer is challenged to pay especially close attention to the plot and to understand what is going on.""The Glass Cage"" has a political prisoner locked in a glass cage which is surrounded 24 hours a day by guards, television monitors, an electric floor and alarms, but the IMF has to get this prisoner out.  As you watch it, the viewer keeps asking himself ""how the heck are they going to pull this one off!"".  For the more morbid viewers out there, in ""The Execution"", the MI producers were given access to the actual gas chamber used to execute criminals in the state of California of the time and they built an exact duplicate showing how it worked.Buy this DVD and prepare yourself for some of the finest entertainment ever made by Hollywood.

In most of the episodes they have dropped the opening sequence where Mr. Phelps selects his agents (by photograph). The season was well produced though they did have a change in producers about one-third into the season which didn't seem to effect the quality of writing. This is also the last season that has Martin Landau & Barbara Bain as cast members.Those of you that might not have noticed there was a strong connection between this series & Star Trek. They were both casted by Joseph D'Agosta; over the course of the first three seasons there were many actors & actresses that appeared in both series. This even included George Takei who was a regular on Star Trek portraying Sulu.The episode that really stood out in season three was ""Nicole"" which guest star Joan Collins was featured as a love interest for Mr. Phelps, alas, she was a double agent. This particular episode also had two more alumni that did at least one Star Trek episode. ""Nicole"" also stood out because it only had Phelps & Hand from the IMF team.DVD quality is excellent & it has subtitles in English, Spanish & Portugese. Unfortunately, There aren't any other bonus features.

You can trust Amazon.com with fast and reliable delivery, even though I live in Canada!I look forward very much to viewing Season 3 which would come prior to Christmas time, and with nothing much to do since I have retired. Season 3 will provide me with nights of good entertainment and nostalgia of the good old days of 1960s. I was then in my twenties and actively  raising a family. My children together with my late grand uncle and his family would drop by on every Saturday evening and watch Mission Impossible together with much joy and great anticipation. Of course, we thoroughly enjoy this weekly TV show.  I still enjoy listening  particularly to  the stirring theme song! Then our TV  was only in black-and-white as color television was not yet introduced in Malaysia! My family and my grand uncle's family definitely had a great time watching this weekly episode. He was also my fishing buddy. Too bad he wasn't around anymore to share the same thrill and relive the old times together...! With tears in my eyes I remember him when I watch Mission Impossible.I hope in Season 3 onwards, Paramount Studios would introduce some bonus features regarding this most popular TV series. An inclusion of an interview with Peter Graves, Martin Landu, Barbara Bain, Peter Lupus and Greg Morris would be great and eargerly sought after by MI fans worldwide. So how about that dear Paramount Studios? Well...MI fans I hope you  would also order Season 3 soon so that your  Christmas this year would have more joy,  excitement and color.

1097274,A3CTMZUJ423ETM,B000UX6TJI,"Michael Simpson ""ttlms""","[3, 3]","Mission: Impossible's third season was its best -- best stories, best cast, best guest stars, and best puzzle-boxes for the IM force to break into.  In fact, the first episode features a literal puzzle box -- a toy that Cinnamon has to solve while impersonating a blind heiress (or not, like Anastasia) who could prevent a petty dictator from taking power in a mysterious country located somewhere on the border between Venezuela and Bulgaria, where everyone speaks English in a broken Eastern European accent, and blue-eyed silver-haired force leader Jim Phelps (Peter Graves) fits right in.  Such was always the backdrop for the foreign settings of the missions, where the force could rely on outstanding intelligence to discover everything from the bad guys' preferred method of torture and murder to the existence of underground tunnels to take them to vaults full of gold bars.  It's probably my personal bias, but I like these episodes the most because I remember them from when I was eight years old, watching this show in its original run.  The DVD set includes my favorite episode -- well, two episodes -- ""The Bunker"", in which a nuclear scientist is working on a bomb for a small country that's holding his wife hostage.  For the first time in the series, the IM force is also up against a third country that has sent an assassin after the scientist as well.  There's also ""The Mercenaries"", during which Barney is able to melt a million bucks' worth of gold with a lawn-mower-engine powered set of curling irons in about six hours, after which Willy reconstitutes the molten gold into new bars that he is easily able to lift onto a forklift.  Okay, so it sounds like you have to suspend disbelief until it cracks, but it works.  The production values are at their zenith in this episode, if you overlook the fact that the basements all look identical for about five episodes in a row, and the guest stars (Pernell Roberts, Lee Meriwether, and the inimitable John Vernon, among others) were the cream of the crop in the '60s.  The incidental music is the best the series had to offer as well.  Like the previous sets, the DVDs don't come with lots of extras, but have good transfers and high sound and picture quality, and the package is trim as can be.

1097275,A25XGZX0YRTJKN,B000UX6TJI,Paul J. Moade,"[55, 59]","Well, here we are again with the third installment from the original Mission Impossible. This is the final season for Martin Landau and Barbara Bain. They will be replaced with Leonard Nimoy in the fourth season.Lots of good episodes here, including my favorite, ""The Execution"". The theme is the same as for the previous seasons. Jim gets a secret mission, selects and briefs his team (although we don't get every detail so there are always surprises), and then they go out and roust the bad guy.  Most of these are credible and believable. Once in a while there is an episode which stretches reality. All are entertaining to watch, and the hour-long show is just about right, time wise.This set will be out in November and I'm looking forward to it with great anticipation. To date there are no extras on the DVD's and I imagine this one will follow suite. Still, the picture is sharp and clear and the audio track is reasonable (remember, these are from the 60's).Once again, if you've never seen one of the television episodes and only know Mission Impossible from the Tom Cruise movies, do yourself a great favor and buy or rent one of the sets.

1097280,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,B000UX6TJI,Simon,"[4, 6]","Yes folks, that's the fine print on the back of the third season box. Whereas the first season was billed ""complete"" and the second season had no disclaimer, this one looks to have a few acknowledged edits. What they are, I cannot say. The show is forty years old and this is my first time experiencing the episodes.Otherwise, there are some fine moments in this set. I'm working through the discs randomly, but the show still seems to be running strong on the formula that made the first two years so successful. Of note is ""The Mind of Stefan Miklos"" which has been billed by the fan community as ""one of the finest hours of television."" It was the first episode I watched, and it is indeed a brain twister that turns some familiar IMF conventions on its head. Check it out.Paramount continues to produce nicely remastered episodes, and my guess is if there are edits it's because some elements were in too poor condition to restore? Whatever the case, I do recommend the third season. I'm docking a star for the edits, but if you like classic television this is the way to go. Hopefully season 4 (with Leonard Nemoy) will be unedited.Please add comments if you can help me figure out what the edits are.",4,"""Some episodes may be edited from their original network versions""",1195603200,"11 21, 2007",2007,1206,"['Yes', 'folks', 'fine', 'print', 'back', 'third', 'season', 'box', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'billed', 'complete', 'second', 'season', 'had', 'disclaimer', 'one', 'have', 'few', 'acknowledged', 'edits', 'What', 'are', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'show', 'forty', 'years', 'old', 'first', 'time', 'experiencing', 'episodes.Otherwise', 'are', 'fine', 'moments', 'set', ""'m"", 'working', 'discs', 'randomly', 'show', 'still', 'be', 'running', 'strong', 'formula', 'made', 'first', 'two', 'years', 'so', 'successful', 'note', 'Mind', 'Stefan', 'Miklos', 'been', 'billed', 'fan', 'community', 'one', 'finest', 'hours', 'television', 'was', 'first', 'episode', 'watched', 'indeed', 'brain', 'twister', 'familiar', 'IMF', 'conventions', 'head', 'Check', 'produce', 'nicely', 'remastered', 'episodes', 'guess', 'are', 'elements', 'were', 'too', 'poor', 'condition', 'restore', 'case', 'do', 'recommend', 'third', 'season', ""'m"", 'docking', 'star', 'edits', 'like', 'classic', 'television', 'way', 'go', 'Hopefully', 'season', '4', 'Leonard', 'Nemoy', 'will', 'be', 'unedited.Please', 'add', 'comments', 'can', 'help', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'edits', 'are']",Mission: Impossible - The Third TV Season

Season 3 is chaotic because of producers' changes: William Read Woodfield/Allan Balter keep the spirit of Gantman's season 1 and 2, Robert H. Thompson and Stanley Kallis--Kallis will continue until season 4. Martin Landau deliver his finest performances in a masochist and pathological trilogy: as an agonizing death row convict in ""The Execution"" (produced and written by William Read Woodfield and Allan Balter), as a guinea pig simulating death by suffocation in ""The Test Case"" and as a hysterical political prisoner tortured to reveal informations in ""The Interrogator"". Season 3 features some top television directors: Sutton Roley, Stuart Hagmann, John Moxey, Resa S. Badiyi. Writer Laurence Heath fashions three of his best offerings: ""The Mercenaries"" (guest starring Pernell Roberts) which highlights the most impressive gold heist of the entire series, ""The Exchange"" (guest starring John Vernon) that explore Cinnamon's hidden phobia (claustrophobia) and ""Illusion"" (guest starring Fritz Weaver) in which Cinnamon performs three songs a la Marlene Dietrich in an East German cabaret. But above all, one man revolutionizes the series: young writer/story consultant Paul Playdon who concocts the ultimate masterpiece in cerebral games: ""The Mind of Stefan Miklos"" guest starring the late Steve Ihnat in the title role playing USSR's finest secret agent which has a photographic memory. Playdon also introduce Rollin's greatest nemesis: master of disguises Alexander Ventlos in the two parter ""The Bunker"", and Playdon rewrite ""Live Bait"": another seminal episode guest starring Anthony Zerbe and Martin Sheen.",5,MISSION: SEASON 3,1191369600,"10 3, 2007",2007,1870,"['particular', 'season', '3', 'peak', 'creative', 'standpoint', 'scripts', 'film-making', 'actings', 'later', 'seasons', 'still', 'contain', 'fine', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'especially', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'season', '4', '5', 'Lynda', 'Day', 'George', 'season', '6', '7', 'Season', '3', 'chaotic', 'producers', 'changes', 'William', 'Read', 'Woodfield/Allan', 'Balter', 'keep', 'spirit', 'Gantman', 'season', '1', '2', 'Robert', 'H.', 'Thompson', 'Stanley', 'Kallis', 'Kallis', 'will', 'continue', 'season', '4', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'deliver', 'finest', 'performances', 'masochist', 'pathological', 'trilogy', 'agonizing', 'death', 'row', 'convict', 'Execution', 'produced', 'written', 'William', 'Read', 'Woodfield', 'Allan', 'Balter', 'guinea', 'pig', 'simulating', 'death', 'suffocation', 'Test', 'Case', 'hysterical', 'political', 'prisoner', 'tortured', 'reveal', 'informations', 'Interrogator', 'Season', '3', 'top', 'television', 'directors', 'Sutton', 'Roley', 'Stuart', 'Hagmann', 'John', 'Moxey', 'Resa', 'S.', 'Badiyi', 'Writer', 'Laurence', 'Heath', 'fashions', 'three', 'best', 'offerings', 'Mercenaries', 'guest', 'starring', 'Pernell', 'Roberts', 'highlights', 'most', 'impressive', 'gold', 'heist', 'entire', 'series', 'Exchange', 'guest', 'starring', 'John', 'Vernon', 'explore', 'Cinnamon', 'hidden', 'phobia', 'claustrophobia', 'Illusion', 'guest', 'starring', 'Fritz', 'Weaver', 'Cinnamon', 'performs', 'three', 'songs', 'la', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'East', 'German', 'cabaret', 'one', 'man', 'series', 'young', 'writer/story', 'consultant', 'Paul', 'Playdon', 'who', 'ultimate', 'masterpiece', 'cerebral', 'games', 'Mind', 'Stefan', 'Miklos', 'guest', 'starring', 'late', 'Steve', 'Ihnat', 'title', 'role', 'playing', 'USSR', 'finest', 'secret', 'agent', 'photographic', 'memory', 'Playdon', 'also', 'introduce', 'Rollin', 'greatest', 'nemesis', 'master', 'disguises', 'Alexander', 'Ventlos', 'two', 'parter', 'Bunker', 'Playdon', 'rewrite', 'Live', 'Bait', 'seminal', 'episode', 'guest', 'starring', 'Anthony', 'Zerbe', 'Martin', 'Sheen']",Mission: Impossible - The Third TV Season

Buoyed by critical acclaim (including two Emmy's for Outstanding Drama Series); the show also saw an increase in viewership coupled with solid ratings. The series seemed poised for bigger and better things.And on both notes, year three delivered the goods.""Mission: Impossible's"" third season maintain the strong standard set during the show's first two years, whilst at the same time providing audience's with plenty of suspense, intrigue, mystery and entertainment. The episodes themselves are well written, produced and acted with a high degree of consistency.Peter Graves returns as the confident and charismatic head of the IMF team Jim Phelps. Also returning are other series regulars such as Martin Landau as Rollin Hand - the team's master of disguise and voices. Barbara Bain as the cool and classy Cinnamon Carter - the group's femme fatale. Greg Morris as Barney Collier - the electronic and gadgets expert and Peter Lupus as Willy Armitage - resident strongman. The chemistry between these five performers lies at the very foundation of the series as they all work so well together. Not surprisingly, it's this line-up that is most fondly remembered by many people.Year three of ""Mission: Impossible"" sees our heroes tackle an array of villains. From dictators trying to seize power (""The Heir Apparent, ""The Cardinal"", & ""The Elixir""), to dangerous crime bosses (""The Contender Parts I & II"", ""The Execution"" & ""The System""), to foiling enemy agents and their deadly plans (""The Diplomat"", ""The Mind of Stefan Miklos"" - widely acknowledge by many as the series best ever episode & ""Live Bait""). The series even broke from it's established format when a mission goes wrong and one the team are captured in ""The Exchange"", a solid and memorable entry which see the IMF desperately trying to rescue one of their own whilst being hunted by all sides.On the surface, it would appear that the series was running smoothly at this point however behind the scenes, things became heated and tense. William Read Woodfield & Allan Balter who were the show's producers and head writers left the series after a bitter feud with ""Mission: Impossible's"" creator and executive producer Bruce Geller. In their place, Paul Playdon became the series head writer (an impressive feat considering he was a relative unknown at the time and all of 28 years of age!) and Stanley Kallis was installed as the show's new producer. Together they would take the series in a new direction with an emphasise of intricate plotlines and developments. This year would also be the show's high point in terms of viewers. The season would see the series end in 11th place in the annual Nielsen ratings (a peak that the series would never attain for the rest of its run). However all of these events would pale in comparison to the bombshell that would hit the show by season's end which resulted in not one by two of the series stars leaving ""Mission: Impossible"" in a very public spat from which the show arguably never fully recovered from.Almost 40 years after these episodes first went to air, they still hold up very well. Tightly scripted, solidly performed and aptly produced and directed, the third season of ""Mission: Impossible"" is retro treat for both fans and newcomers alike. If you're familiar with this classic, get yourself re-acquainted. If not, find out how things were done - old school style.
