actresses Thora Birch (here she is a blonde) and my favorite Christina Ricci..They shine as does the other 2 girls in this more then wonderful movie..The movie features a fantastic 1970s Classic Rock soundtrack..It covers all areas of what 70s Classic Rock was..Pick up the cd soundtrack while you are at it along with this dvd..The only downside on this dvd is there is SADLY No Behind The Scenes..I wish they would have behind the scenes and bloopers of this movie would have been great..And even better would be a reunion of the cast..Coz i am wondering what ever became of the other 2 actresses in this movie with Ricci & Birch..And this too i think they could have casted the ""older"" versions of the girls better then they did..Rosie O Donnell as the older Christina Ricci in Rosie's dreams..The only one of the ""older"" versions that is really believable that can really picture is Melanie Griffith as the ""older"" Thora Birth..But they are not in this movie long thankfully..They are only in start and end with maybe a total time of 5 minutes or a tad more..Not enough to ruin this great movie..The movie focuses thankfully more on Ricci / Birch and the girls..Other then what i just mentioned this is one of the greatest films you will ever see..And if you had been between ages 5 and teen years in the 1970s it will bring back loads of memories..Everything from the opening scene of the girls playing ""red rover red rover let (put your name here) come over"" to the music to the looks and just things did as a kid and teen in those days..It is reinacted sooooo well that you can't even tell this is a 1995 movie..The sets the feeling is total 70s..It is recreated magnificentally..I am 38 this year *2004* and it brought back many memories for me..Christina Ricci here reminds me sooooo much of My Beloved Mandy when we first met right down to a priceless basketball scene..So this movie has sentimental value to me..Watch this movie maybe it will touch you in that way too..But either way i can guarentee that it will bring back memories..It will be a fun filled viewing exsperiance..A kind of a early teen girl version of Stand By Me..Enjoyable Fun and Wonderful filmed movie adds up fun for all no matter when your generation is.NOT TO BE MISSEDGets better with every single time you watch it..A must for any fan of the one and only Christina Ricci..If you are a fan of

It promotes sexism in the worst ways. The girls a children are all persecuted by boys. Practically every word out of these boys' mouths is sexist. That is not how real boys behave at all.

""You can't...you're a girl"".  ""You're good...but only for a girl!""  This is taken to the absolute extreme. This is not like real life at all. Every interaction with the boys these girls have they act as if they are being attacked. In response they proceed to become violent physically, verbally, and by their actions. They do horrible things like stealing the boys' clothes while they are skinny dipping, and spying on them to see their p#&is;'. Punching and attacking a fat boy, who admittedly was being a jerk, but in real life wouldn't have acted quite that sexist. In the present timeline when the girls are grown one of them is pregnant.

It is the charm of the four young actresses (Christina Ricci acting as the young Roberta is my personal favorite but all four are great) that is able to give this movie a candid fresh feeling in spite of the somewhat corny cliched story which you feel you have already seen. Was it &quot;stand by me&quot; which had four friends, each with a different character type? No, that was about boys... Here as well we have a mystery as the girls are trying to solve the death of a young boy, and the outcome can be anticipated. The adult part - although equipped with a group of well-known actresses was not able to convince me (it is surprising to note that the casting of Rosie Odonnol as the adult Christina Ricci is very believable although funny at first sight). How is it that in the movies all the young people portrayed grow up to be really outstanding writers, actresses, doctors, etc.? What happened to all the ordinary people we all grew up to be? The adult part is a little too short and not too satisfying. I would have been interested to know what happened to these 4 women since that one summer we had a chance of seeing. The movie makes it seem as if their lives - or rather their friendship was somewhat stopped at the age of 12 and then continued  at the adult stage. What happened since the age of 12? I mean, they did live next to each other...are there no memories from later, maybe more important stages of life? Were there no old grudges or new friends that interfered? Did they not prefer to have one intimate friend rather then a group?I think that the movie could have been &quot;full&quot; with only the young, &quot;then&quot; part, however nice to watch as it is.

Marshall,"[41, 42]","This is a great character film expanding the lives of four young girls from the good old 70's decade and stirring up a lot of old memories.The film starts with the adult versions of the four girls played by Rosie O'Donnell, Melanie Griffith, Demi Moore and Rita Wilson as they come together for a reunion for the birth of Wilson's child. Not much has changed! O'Donnell has become a doctor, Griffith a movie star, Moore a writer and Wilson a pink and perky mother to be. This film allows us all to discover how these women came to be and it is actually pretty insightful. So sit back and take yourself on an ""old school"" journey back in time.Soon enough this movie goes back in time to the early 70's when kids could ride bikes all over town, ice cream sodas were the rage, AM radios hung on every handlebar, laughter hung in the air and stories were meant to be told. The young O'Donnell is played by Christina Ricci, a tough tomboy growing up in a family of men because her mother was killed. Ricci is the strong one, the shoulder to cry on, the fighter who would rather play sports than sprout a couple of breasts. Griffith is portrayed as a young girl by Thora Birch and as a youth is fascinated early by sex, fake breasts and being an actress. Birch is the adventurer, the wandering heart and the heartbreaker of the group. Moore's child is played by Gaby Hoffman and she is the quiet, introspective and questioning young girl. Hoffman gets herself in all sorts of dilemmas stemming from the shame of divorced parents who act more like children than she does. Finally Wilson is played by Ashleigh Aston Moore, and of all the girls she remains steadfastly the same in adulthood as in youth, a simple, rather innocent girl surrounded by a perfectionist mother (played by Bonnie Hunt!) and an entire room of pink and lacy curtains.The young girls are shown growing up and daring the world, finding where they all belong and how they are alike yet very different. The film brings back great memories of the time through the use of great music and ties to certain events that impacted the generation. The happiness and innocence of the decade is found on the country roads and soda shops as the girls plan their adventures. Silly crushes and fights with boys are inevitable along with all the challenges of growing up imperfect. All of the fun of childhood is represented here, the cemetery s&eacute;ances, tree-house meetings, excursions on bicycles, splashes in the river, sneaking out the bedroom window at night and childhood friendships that should last a lifetime. I found this film inspiring and insightful, but then I came from the same generation so I can totally relate.
