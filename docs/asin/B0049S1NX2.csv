This Blu-Ray is a phenomenal way to relive the up and down and up again season that was the 2010 Green Bay Packers. NFL Films had so many players miked-up this season, that it gives you inside access like I've never seen before, and getting it in Blu-Ray makes the picture simply mind-blowing.

This was the best price anywhere for this DVD and I live in PACKER YOOPER COUNTRY.  My only complaint is why was this DVD made in Mexico?

1390104,A3737SEKOIHFQE,B0049S1NX2,ez,"[0, 3]",I am very disappointed in the DVDs I purchased. 15 different supposed super bowl collection series DVDs. A series in which a different super bowl was what the cover depicts for each team. THE SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS then it gives the number of the super bowl in roman numerals. Other have Americans game the SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP and shows the ring on the cover. Did I miss something? Would that mean the game is what the DVD is about?  Wrong the only super bowls I have received in their eternity are the two Broncos' super bowls of the Super Bowl XXXII and Super Bowl XXXIII that came along with the 1977 AFC Championship Game in a three set entitled the Broncos 3 greatest games. Said nothing about super bowl games. The only reason I knew the super bowl games were included was I had researched it on another website what I should have done for these. All very misleading. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning 13 DVD.

These playoff games of super bolw winners are fun to me. I now have a couple hundred complete games in my collection and I have highlights of every super bowl so far.

From the heartbreaking overtime losses, to the unimaginable injuries, and then to bounce back to become the ultimate underdog and win it all, this could have been spectacular.The Pack had to win their final 2 regular season games to even make the playoffs.  The Pack then became the visiting team for every playoff game.  The Pack had to face a heavily favored Falcons team that they lost to earlier in the year, and then faced the Bears for the NFC Championship...... come on, this is DESTINY!!!Never before had a 6th seeded NFC team won the Super Bowl.  Even Madden's NFL video game predicted Green Bay to lose (except for the Giants/Patriots, the game had predicted every winner in previous years).Overcoming the loss of Donald Driver and Charles Woodson in the biggest game of their careers, again, DESTINY!!The DVD offers highlights but didn't capture the emotional rollercoaster that every fan/player experienced.
