879204,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B00079ZACW,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[3, 4]","I adore Gregory Peck! So I do not come to this movie unbiased. This is a British film that I had never seen before, and as a matter of fact, I'm not sure I'd even heard of it before. But it starred Peck, so I bought it. Awfully glad I did.Peck plays Forrester, a Canadian fighter pilot who is flying for the RAF. He lost his brand new wife in a London bombing, and it left him bitter and reckless. He admits he was trying to get himself killed ever since. Problem is, nobody wants to fly with him anymore. The navigator who was with him when the film opens in Burma was wounded because Forrester decided to go below the ack ack shooting when his orders were to get above it. Instead he managed to bomb the gunner nest where it was coming from. So he's a hero once again, but the wounded navigator is glad he was wounded: he won't have to fly with Forrester anymore.The doctor and the commanding officer think he is cracking up, so the doc takes Forrester with him when he goes to visit a missionary and her Christian Burmese assistants, and meets the beautiful and soft-spoken Anna, played by Win Min Than (sounds Vietnamese to me). He is utterly charmed. He goes to see her again just before leaving on what is to be a routine mission, and she gives him a Burmese ruby ""to keep for me."" He promises her he will come back.So he and his new navigator, and Blor, who had been his tent-mate and was headed for a new assignment, are packed into his little Mosquito plane to fly over Japanese-held territory to (a) deliver Blor and (b) give the new navigator, a very young kid, a chance to fly with him and get to know the routine. No big deal, until one of his engines catches fire, the extinguisher fails to put it out, and they have to ditch. The navigator's leg is burned by the fire as they are escaping from the plane, which then bursts into a huge flame when the fuel tank blows.So there's the three of them, about 20 miles inside Japanese-held territory, with one severely injured and only a little water. No food, and not much else. Blor has Forrester turn out his pockets, mentioning that anything, however trivial, might be useful to their survival. So Blor sees the ruby, and comments, ""Don't tell me you've been buying those, too. They're all fake, you know."" (He's wrong there; Burma is a source of quite a few precious gems, including rubies.) Forrester does not comment, but just stuffs it back in his pocket.Blor wants to stay with the wreckage (ashes, mostly) of the plane, and wait for rescue. But Forrester points out that they are in Jap territory, and may be found by Japanese before the RAF can locate them. And in fact, the RAF concludes that they burned up with the plane and aren't even looking for them. So Forrester insists they must walk out of this desert to the river which is about 20 miles away, and he and Blor will have to carry the navigator. Blor complains and argues all the way, but Forrester outranks him, so he cooperates for awhile.I'm not going to spoil the ending, but let's just say Forrester kept his promise to Anna. He came back to her.It's a good movie, mostly because Peck and Than make such a sweet couple, and because I adore Gregory Peck. He gives a superb performance in this movie, but then he always does. But it's not a great movie, so I can only give it three stars.",3,Gregory Peck is Muy Macho,1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,3319,"['adore', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'So', 'do', 'not', 'come', 'movie', 'unbiased', 'British', 'film', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'matter', 'fact', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'d"", 'even', 'heard', 'starred', 'Peck', 'bought', 'Awfully', 'glad', 'did.Peck', 'plays', 'Forrester', 'Canadian', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'who', 'flying', 'RAF', 'lost', 'brand', 'new', 'wife', 'London', 'bombing', 'left', 'bitter', 'reckless', 'was', 'trying', 'get', 'killed', 'ever', 'Problem', 'nobody', 'fly', 'anymore', 'navigator', 'who', 'was', 'when', 'film', 'Burma', 'was', 'wounded', 'because', 'Forrester', 'decided', 'go', 'ack', 'ack', 'shooting', 'when', 'orders', 'were', 'get', 'Instead', 'managed', 'bomb', 'gunner', 'nest', 'where', 'was', 'coming', 'hero', 'once', 'again', 'wounded', 'navigator', 'glad', 'was', 'wounded', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'fly', 'Forrester', 'anymore.The', 'doctor', 'commanding', 'officer', 'think', 'cracking', 'up', 'doc', 'Forrester', 'when', 'visit', 'missionary', 'Christian', 'Burmese', 'assistants', 'beautiful', 'soft-spoken', 'Anna', 'played', 'Win', 'Min', 'Than', 'Vietnamese', 'utterly', 'charmed', 'see', 'again', 'just', 'leaving', 'be', 'routine', 'mission', 'Burmese', 'ruby', 'keep', 'will', 'come', 'back.So', 'new', 'navigator', 'Blor', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'tent-mate', 'was', 'headed', 'new', 'assignment', 'are', 'packed', 'little', 'Mosquito', 'plane', 'fly', 'Japanese-held', 'territory', 'deliver', 'Blor', 'b', 'give', 'new', 'navigator', 'very', 'young', 'kid', 'chance', 'fly', 'get', 'know', 'routine', 'big', 'deal', 'one', 'engines', 'catches', 'fire', 'extinguisher', 'put', 'out', 'have', 'ditch', 'navigator', 'leg', 'burned', 'fire', 'are', 'escaping', 'plane', 'then', 'huge', 'flame', 'when', 'fuel', 'tank', 'three', 'about', '20', 'miles', 'inside', 'Japanese-held', 'territory', 'one', 'severely', 'injured', 'only', 'little', 'water', 'food', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'Blor', 'Forrester', 'turn', 'out', 'pockets', 'mentioning', 'anything', 'however', 'trivial', 'might', 'be', 'useful', 'survival', 'So', 'Blor', 'ruby', 'comments', 'Do', ""n't"", 'tell', ""'ve"", 'been', 'buying', 'too', ""'re"", 'fake', 'know', 'wrong', 'there', 'Burma', 'source', 'quite', 'few', 'precious', 'gems', 'including', 'rubies', 'Forrester', 'not', 'comment', 'just', 'stuffs', 'back', 'pocket.Blor', 'stay', 'wreckage', 'ashes', 'mostly', 'plane', 'wait', 'rescue', 'Forrester', 'points', 'out', 'are', 'Jap', 'territory', 'may', 'be', 'found', 'Japanese', 'RAF', 'can', 'locate', 'fact', 'RAF', 'burned', 'up', 'plane', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'looking', 'So', 'Forrester', 'insists', 'must', 'walk', 'desert', 'river', '20', 'miles', 'away', 'Blor', 'will', 'have', 'carry', 'navigator', 'Blor', 'complains', 'way', 'Forrester', 'so', 'awhile.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'spoil', 'ending', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'Forrester', 'kept', 'promise', 'Anna', 'came', 'back', 'her.It', 'good', 'movie', 'mostly', 'Peck', 'Than', 'make', 'such', 'sweet', 'couple', 'adore', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'superb', 'performance', 'movie', 'then', 'always', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'three', 'stars']",The Purple Plain 1954

879207,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00079ZACW,C. O. DeRiemer,"[32, 32]","""I wanted to die but I got medals instead."" This is squadron leader Bill Forrester (Gregory Peck), a mosquito fighter-bomber pilot stationed at a makeshift airbase in Burma during WWII. Forrester had met a young woman in London, they'd fallen in love and married, and on the evening of their marriage she was killed in a German air raid. Now he impassively takes enormous risks, sometimes endangering others. He really does want to die. Forrester meets a young Burmese woman, Anna (Win Min Than), and gradually begins to realize that death isn't the best future he can imagine. He's assigned to fly to another base carrying a passenger, but the mosquito crashes and he, his navigator and the passenger are stranded in Japanese territory in the middle of the Burmese desert, a desolate place of sun-burnt rock and scrub, with almost no water. His navigator is seriously injured and the passenger slowly just gives up and shoots himself. Forrester finds himself determined to carry the navigator thirty miles to the nearest river where they have a chance of rescue.It's hard to give a sense of this movie. The story line is relatively simple and can be described by what it is not. It's not a war story. It's not a simple romance. It's not just the story of a man who finds his way back from tragedy. The atmosphere of the movie -- at times a kind of dreamy quality, drenched with color and filmed in some unreal and spectacular scenery -- keeps the story both engrossing and understated. The end of the movie, when Forrester finds his way back to Anna, is one of the most delicately filmed scenes of emotional commitment I've ever seen.This is an unusual and first-class movie. According to IMDB, this is the only movie Win Min Than ever made. She is a combination of beauty and shyness that makes Forrester's awakening entirely believable. The secondary characters are handled exceptionally well. The Scots missionary with whom Anna and many refugee children live is played by Brenda De Banzie, an outstanding British actress. If you have a chance, watch her in Hobson's Choice. The doctor who befriends Forrester is played by Bernard Lee, another accomplished Brit.

879209,AZUBX0AYYNTFF,B00079ZACW,Donald M. Bishop,"[1, 1]","Set during the Burma campaign in 1944, Gregory Peck plays a pilot in the Royal Canadian Air Force, ""Squadron Leader Forrester,"" fatigued by the war, still traumatized by the death of his wife in a London bombing.  His healing begins when he visits a Burmese village with his squadron's doctor, and meets ""Anna,"" played by Win Min Than.While the film received good reviews when it opened in 1957, other films better treat PTSD, combat fatigue, escape and evasion, intercultural affection, missionary devotion, and the Burma campaign.  There are some good scenes with the de Havilland Mosquito bomber, but there are better aviation films.Still, Peck's performance is a good one.  There's a moving scene of the unchurched ""Forrester"" joining missionaries and Burmese Christians singing an Easter hymn.  Agreeably, Win Min Than's portrayal of an Asian woman does not play to stereotypes.  Brenda de Banzie's performance as a Scottish missionary is striking and engaging.  Filmed in Sri Lanka (then Ceylon), there's some fine scenery.  Interestingly, Win Min Than never made another film.In the film, Peck was put to the test when his aircraft crashes behind Japanese lines.  Those interested in crisis leadership and survival can compare Peck's leadership with the behavior of another officer in the group -- positive and dysfunctional roles, if you will.Not a home run, but a good solid double.-30-",3,"Danger, fatigue, and stress during the Burma campaign, and love too",1314489600,"08 28, 2011",2011,1395,"['Set', 'Burma', 'campaign', '1944', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'pilot', 'Royal', 'Canadian', 'Air', 'Force', 'Squadron', 'Leader', 'Forrester', 'fatigued', 'war', 'still', 'traumatized', 'death', 'wife', 'London', 'bombing', 'healing', 'when', 'Burmese', 'village', 'squadron', 'doctor', 'Anna', 'played', 'Win', 'Min', 'Than.While', 'film', 'received', 'good', 'reviews', 'when', 'opened', '1957', 'other', 'films', 'better', 'treat', 'PTSD', 'combat', 'fatigue', 'escape', 'evasion', 'intercultural', 'affection', 'missionary', 'devotion', 'Burma', 'campaign', 'are', 'good', 'scenes', 'de', 'Havilland', 'Mosquito', 'bomber', 'are', 'better', 'aviation', 'films.Still', 'Peck', 'performance', 'good', 'one', 'moving', 'scene', 'unchurched', 'Forrester', 'joining', 'missionaries', 'Burmese', 'Christians', 'singing', 'Easter', 'hymn', 'Agreeably', 'Win', 'Min', 'Than', 'portrayal', 'Asian', 'woman', 'not', 'play', 'stereotypes', 'Brenda', 'Banzie', 'performance', 'Scottish', 'missionary', 'striking', 'engaging', 'Filmed', 'Sri', 'Lanka', 'then', 'Ceylon', 'fine', 'scenery', 'Interestingly', 'Win', 'Min', 'Than', 'never', 'made', 'film.In', 'film', 'Peck', 'was', 'put', 'test', 'when', 'aircraft', 'crashes', 'Japanese', 'lines', 'interested', 'crisis', 'leadership', 'survival', 'can', 'compare', 'Peck', 'leadership', 'behavior', 'officer', 'group', 'positive', 'dysfunctional', 'roles', 'will.Not', 'home', 'run', 'good', 'solid', 'double.-30-']",The Purple Plain 1954

879212,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B00079ZACW,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[3, 3]","Assam in Eastern India, 1944. Squadron Leader Bill Forrester (Gregory Peck) is a Canadian serving in Royal Air Force and flying a DeHavilland Mosquito - a twin engine, two seated, very fast and VERY powerfully armed fighter-bomber. Because of his skill and agressivity, he is a real life legend amongst allied pilots serving in India-Burma-China theater - but nobody really likes to fly with him (or next to him) and his superiors consider him a liability rather than an asset.Why? Because Squadron Leader Bill Forrester is suicidal! It is not a secret that he wants to die - and that he was trying to do so for the last four years (the reason will not be explained here, to avoid spoilers). But the Grim Reaper has a particularly nasty sense of humor and sometimes, when somebody looks for him very hard, HE very skillfully avoids him. And so, even if many have fallen on his left and more have fallen on his right, Squadron Leader Bill Forrester always survived, just getting more medals, promotions, scars and hangovers...His commanding officer, Wing Commander Aldridge (Anthony Bushell) orders finally his medical officer, Doctor Harris (Bernard Lee, of 007 fame...) to either heal Forrester depression or find a medical reason to reform him and send him back to England. Doctor Harris will attempt to help Forrester by ending his isolation. As Forrester has no friends and no hobbies, doctor Harris will encourage him to give some time to assist a local shelter for displaced people (mostly Burmese refugees). The manager of this place is a formidable Scottish lady Ms Mac Nab(Brenda De Banzie) widow of a missionary, who spend almost all her life in Asia and in large part ""went native"". It is not possible to remain depressed anywhere near Ms Mac Nab, as she has more energy, character, wits, guts and spirit than even a dozen living bodies could contain.And so Bill Forrester will start his convalescence - greatly helped in it by him meeting a delicious, young, adorable Burmese Christian refugee, Anna. This character is played by a Burmese actress, Win Min Than in her only cinema role (she later became a buddhist nun). Win Min Than played Anna in an absolutely perfect way and she is at least as much the star of this film as Gregory Peck.All of this covers basically the first quarter of the film. But as it was already said, the Grim Reaper has a particularly nasty sense of humor - and now, that Bill Forrester have found again that life has a sweet taste, the shadow which avoided him for the last four years, will come back... And if it is not always so easy to catch with the Grim Reaper, HE usually has no trouble to catch up with us... Especially, when somebody flies almost every day dangerous missions over Japanese occupied Burma, where Zeros prowl the skies and flak can hide behind any bush. Burma which includes fertile rice fields, lush jungles, but also (it is less known) some hostile, red hot plains, covered with thorny shrub, where during the dry season water is scarce but where poisonous snakes slither by bushels...I liked this ""oldie but goldie"" (made in 1954). It is not an immortal masterpiece, but a good, very honest, interesting and touching film, in which you really are concerned for the two main heroes, especially in the second part of the film... Do not expect a lot of military action, but survival scenes in the most hostile part of Burma wilderness are very strong. Scenario is very solid and logical and actors are GREAT.

I found the story exquisitely dull. Troubled flier finds love in Burma, accidentally crashes plane, walks out of desert, carrying navigator across his shoulders. Deserts in Burma? This looks as if it were filmed in Arizona! There is no subplot to speak of. The direction is flat and linear and uninspiring. Peck is wooden. The Burmese actress is interesting but not fascinating. We're supposed to be up to our necks in danger, Japanese behind every bush, but apart from a tiny skirmish at the beginning, World War II could be happening a thousand miles away. Eric Ambler wrote the script and it is surprisingly uninspiring. The DVD picture quality is very good and the colors are bright and clear. Heaven knows it doesn't cost much.

879216,A27M15DFUPV1CK,B00079ZACW,peterfromkanata,"[76, 79]","While Gregory Peck heads the cast, ""The Purple Plain"" is a British World War II film, produced in 1954 by the J. Arthur Rank Studios (and presumably distributed by MGM). So far reviews seem to fall into two camps--people who love it and people who are unimpressed with it. I find myself somewhere between these two extremes. Unlike at least one other reviewer, I will try not to reveal too much of the plot for first-time viewers.Mr. Peck plays Squadron Leader Bill Forrester, a Canadian pilot and veteran of the Battle of Britain, now assigned to the Asian theatre of the war, specifically Burma, against the Japanese. Having lost his young wife in the London blitz, Forrester feels he has nothing to live for, and flies his Mosquito missions accordingly. He is reckless, even suicidal, much to the chagrin of his navigator as well as the people on the ground.The kind Dr. Harris (a ""pre-M"" Bernard Lee) tries to help Forrester out of his depression by involving him with some of the local Burmese people, including a lovely young woman, Anna (Win Min Than). Forrester becomes captivated with Anna, and slowly regains his self respect and will to live. His survival instincts are soon put to the test. On the next flight, his plane crashes in very harsh, and Japanese-held, territory. Forrester survives the crash along with his young navigator(Lyndon Brook), who receives nasty burns, and an older scientist, Blore (Maurice Denham). With limited water, and the blazing Burmese sun, the three men face a harsh fate, with a questionable chance of survival. Can Forrester return to the woman who has rekindled his interest in life, and redeem a tattered reputation with his compatriots ?Mr. Peck delivers a compelling performance--he remains one of the most watchable actors in movies. I should also mention that fine British character actress, Brenda De Banzie--her role is small, but she leaves an indelible impression as Miss McNabb, the indefatigable Scottish missionary.The full-screen picture exhibits effective colour--the sound is mono--don't look for extras.""The Purple Plain"" may not be one of Gregory Peck's most famous films--nor can it be considered one of the classic films of the fifties. At the same time, I found it an absorbing drama, well-acted by Mr. Peck, Ms. Than and a fine British cast--there is action, romance, suspense and important, universal themes are explored.

If that wasn't bad enough, he even failed to kill himself, taking on risky missions that earned him medals rather than death.We meet the man as he is stationed at a far Burma air strip working with the English towards the final years of World War II with Japanese incursions in the area.  He meets a woman, Anna, played awesomely by Miss Win Min Than.  That Hollywood would use an actual Asian actress was amazing in itself, but also to hint at an interracial romance was also quite a major breakthrough, especially for 1950s filmmaking.  So happy to see this change.Several themes in this war film:  once having had a major tragedy, you can either give up or find a reason to live.  Squadron leader Forrester (Peck) has had a major tragedy, but through the help of the beautiful Anna, finds a reason to live.When he crash-lands inside enemy lines, his passenger Bore, confronts his tragedy through suicide.  He has something to live for, yet fails to deliver and gives up.Memorable Moment:  Anna says that the Burmese bury their dead in the earth, not in their hearts.  This had the expected effect on Forrester -- maybe he has lived with this burden for so long that it has poisoned his life -- that not giving up and having something to live for is the answer.Per IMDB, this was Miss Win Min Than's only Hollywood film, which is really too bad.  She was excellent.DVD:  Only scene selections and language selections.  No commentary, no nothing!Bottom Line:  I was quite impressed with this film.  The ending was not expected and I thought was sweet.  Except for a bomb or two, not a lot of battle scenes; quite character driven.
