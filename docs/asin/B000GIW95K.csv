However, I gave this four stars instead of the usual five because of the political correctness that appears in the last two episodes.  In one, we learn of that a lesbian relationship is just dandy, even when there is a child involved.  In the other, the Catholic priest and a Bible spouting parishioner are the villains.  Some nasty anti-Christian commentary appears as well.  While the Frost series has always been determinedly secular, there was no call for the added attacks on the faith that has almost disappeared from England.

1004589,AP3SD9K0Q3QAC,B000GIW95K,"L. S. Reed ""roadrunner""","[0, 0]","For the past 2-3 years, the BBC detective shows (Midsomer, Frost, Paskoe and Dalziel, Miss Marple, MI5, Waking the Dead, The Last Detective, etc.) have been my video soundtrack while riding my stationary bike. I grind through them pretty quickly. They have to be reasonably absorbing and there are a few things that drive me nuts. With long-running series, I'm always alert for signs that the production team has run out of ideas or that ""the talent"" is losing interest or interfering with production. A lot of these are standard critiques of shows that have ""jumped the shark,"" but the things I'm always looking for are: increasingly implausible plots, replacement of departed supporting characters with less interesting characters, and, a particular warning sign, plots that ""broaden"" the back-story of one or more of the characters. Often these are the result of the actor's agent lobbying the producer for a chance for his client to ""show his real talent."" Usually these characters just aren't interesting enough to sustain the ""drama.""Frost is one of the few long-running series that has avoided these problems. Frost has stayed the same -- brilliant, intuitive detective, bit of a maverick, disastrous personal life. The plots are always good, just enough mystery to keep you guessing without the implausible ""explain everything"" last scenes.Frost's relationship with Chief Constable Mullet was a real challenge that every detective series with a maverick detective (going back to Rockford Files) has to deal with: how can this guy who has solved dozens of spectacular crimes remain on the ""voice of authority's"" s**** list? They handled that in Touch of Frost about as well as it can be done -- Mullet is still pretty much of a paper-pushing budget weenie, and he periodically rails at Frost about expense reports. But they avoided the pitfall of trying to keep the relationship exactly the same as it was in episode 1 and the equally dangerous pitfall of letting Mullet become a member of the ""Jack Frost Fan Club"". They broadened Mullet's character ever so slightly and let the relationship between the two become a little more complex (for example, Mullet defends Jack against outside critics once in a while), while still leaving Mullet basically frustrated and irate at Jack most of the time.Another change I liked was reducing the ""detective sergeant of the month"" steady rotation and letting George become more of a regular sidekick. George is a really solid character and it's good that he was allowed to step a little more toward the center of the stage.Clearly, the number of episodes per season declined as time went on, which accounts for 2 seasons in one package. It's possible that they recognized they didn't have enough good story lines to sustain a full schedule, or that the actor portraying Frost wasn't willing to commit to the lengthy shooting schedule. If so, good for them! The quality of the episodes, the acting, the production values, etc., is as high as the first season -- maybe better. That might be unique among long-running series.",5,Right up there with the best Frosts,1317513600,"10 2, 2011",2011,3069,"['past', '2-3', 'years', 'BBC', 'detective', 'shows', 'Midsomer', 'Frost', 'Paskoe', 'Dalziel', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'MI5', 'Waking', 'Dead', 'Last', 'Detective', 'etc', 'have', 'been', 'video', 'soundtrack', 'riding', 'stationary', 'bike', 'grind', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'have', 'be', 'reasonably', 'absorbing', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'drive', 'nuts', 'long-running', 'series', ""'m"", 'always', 'alert', 'signs', 'production', 'team', 'run', 'ideas', 'talent', 'losing', 'interest', 'interfering', 'production', 'lot', 'are', 'standard', 'critiques', 'shows', 'have', 'jumped', 'shark', 'things', ""'m"", 'always', 'looking', 'are', 'increasingly', 'implausible', 'plots', 'replacement', 'departed', 'supporting', 'characters', 'less', 'interesting', 'characters', 'particular', 'warning', 'sign', 'plots', 'broaden', 'back-story', 'one', 'more', 'characters', 'are', 'result', 'actor', 'agent', 'lobbying', 'producer', 'chance', 'client', 'show', 'real', 'talent', 'Usually', 'characters', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'enough', 'sustain', 'drama', 'Frost', 'one', 'few', 'long-running', 'series', 'avoided', 'problems', 'Frost', 'stayed', 'same', 'brilliant', 'intuitive', 'detective', 'bit', 'maverick', 'disastrous', 'personal', 'life', 'plots', 'are', 'always', 'good', 'just', 'enough', 'mystery', 'keep', 'guessing', 'implausible', 'explain', 'everything', 'last', 'scenes.Frost', 'relationship', 'Chief', 'Constable', 'Mullet', 'was', 'real', 'challenge', 'detective', 'series', 'maverick', 'detective', 'going', 'back', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'deal', 'how', 'can', 'guy', 'who', 'solved', 'dozens', 'spectacular', 'crimes', 'remain', 'voice', 'authority', 's****', 'list', 'handled', 'Touch', 'Frost', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'Mullet', 'still', 'pretty', 'much', 'paper-pushing', 'budget', 'weenie', 'periodically', 'Frost', 'expense', 'reports', 'avoided', 'pitfall', 'trying', 'keep', 'relationship', 'exactly', 'same', 'was', 'episode', '1', 'equally', 'dangerous', 'pitfall', 'letting', 'Mullet', 'become', 'member', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'Fan', 'Club', 'broadened', 'Mullet', 'character', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'let', 'relationship', 'two', 'become', 'little', 'more', 'complex', 'example', 'Mullet', 'Jack', 'critics', 'once', 'while', 'still', 'leaving', 'Mullet', 'basically', 'frustrated', 'irate', 'Jack', 'most', 'time.Another', 'change', 'liked', 'was', 'reducing', 'detective', 'sergeant', 'month', 'steady', 'rotation', 'letting', 'George', 'become', 'more', 'regular', 'sidekick', 'George', 'really', 'solid', 'character', 'good', 'was', 'allowed', 'step', 'little', 'more', 'center', 'stage.Clearly', 'number', 'episodes', 'season', 'declined', 'time', 'went', '2', 'seasons', 'one', 'package', 'possible', 'recognized', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'good', 'story', 'lines', 'sustain', 'full', 'schedule', 'actor', 'portraying', 'Frost', 'was', ""n't"", 'willing', 'commit', 'lengthy', 'shooting', 'schedule', 'so', 'good', 'quality', 'episodes', 'acting', 'production', 'values', 'etc.', 'as', 'high', 'first', 'season', 'maybe', 'better', 'might', 'be', 'unique', 'long-running', 'series']",A Touch of Frost - Seasons 11 & 12
