Bill Withers and his exemplary music are two things so many people have taken for granted over the years, so it's a pleasure to meet the man and explore his life, ideas and the feedback from his family, personal friends and friends in the music business.Most people have a particular ""comfort"" food, like macaroni and cheese or pork 'n beans on toast; something so good, but so simple. Bill Withers' work is ""comfort music"" for everyone. And it is as relevant now as when it first debuted, thirty or so years ago!

1382956,A2J4E6UU0GUDB4,B0042EJDJY,"Fred McGhee ""fredmcghee""","[5, 5]","Whether you know it or not, you have been influenced by Bill Withers.  His unique songwriting and singing helped to define an era in American music history.  Longtime admirers, the filmmakers wanted to find out what Bill has been up to and decided to do something about it.  In this film they take us along for the ride.  And what a ride it is.  It turns out that Bill is not just an interesting musician, but also an interesting man.  One can quibble with the film's choices; for instance another reviewer laments that the various snippets of Withers in Slab Fork, at his Navy reunion, or at his tribute concert are too short and unrevealing, but I disagree.  The majority of the movie is spent at Withers' house in Los Angeles and consists of interviews, discussions and short segments of Bill dispensing generous amounts of wisdom from various locations inside his very comfortable (and I use that adjective in its best sense) home.  These segments reveal him to be a thoughtful, sensitive, wise, warm and generous man and not only help to explain much of his music but also shed genuine philosophical insight.  And can I just say how beautiful his wife and children are?We live in a world of artificial truths and artificial people. This film reveals him to be exactly what you thought and felt upon hearing his music:  a deeply rooted and dignified tree standing tall and lovingly in the forest.",4,A terrific re-introduction,1300320000,"03 17, 2011",2011,1400,"['know', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'influenced', 'Bill', 'Withers', 'unique', 'songwriting', 'singing', 'helped', 'define', 'era', 'American', 'music', 'history', 'Longtime', 'admirers', 'filmmakers', 'wanted', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'Bill', 'been', 'up', 'decided', 'do', 'something', 'film', 'take', 'ride', 'what', 'ride', 'out', 'Bill', 'not', 'just', 'interesting', 'musician', 'also', 'interesting', 'man', 'One', 'can', 'quibble', 'film', 'choices', 'instance', 'reviewer', 'various', 'snippets', 'Withers', 'Slab', 'Fork', 'Navy', 'reunion', 'tribute', 'concert', 'are', 'too', 'short', 'unrevealing', 'disagree', 'majority', 'movie', 'spent', 'Withers', 'house', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'consists', 'interviews', 'discussions', 'short', 'segments', 'Bill', 'dispensing', 'generous', 'amounts', 'wisdom', 'various', 'locations', 'very', 'comfortable', 'use', 'adjective', 'best', 'sense', 'home', 'segments', 'reveal', 'be', 'thoughtful', 'sensitive', 'wise', 'warm', 'generous', 'man', 'not', 'only', 'help', 'explain', 'much', 'music', 'also', 'shed', 'genuine', 'philosophical', 'insight', 'can', 'just', 'say', 'how', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'children', 'are', 'live', 'world', 'artificial', 'truths', 'artificial', 'people', 'film', 'be', 'exactly', 'what', 'thought', 'felt', 'hearing', 'music', 'deeply', 'rooted', 'dignified', 'tree', 'standing', 'tall', 'lovingly', 'forest']",Still Bill

Lane ""professional audience member""","[0, 0]","Poet, composer, philosopher, husband, father, and former stutterer, performer Bill Withers (Ain't No Sunshine and Lean on Me) is profiled in this nicely edited documentary which reinforces our impression that this is an exemplary human being. He won a Grammy in 1981 and was inducted into the Songwriters' Hall of Fame in 2005.Born in the tiny coal-mining town of Slab Fork, West Virginia, Withers had a childhood that shaped him: bullied by cruel classmates, supported by close chums, and cheered by his beloved grandmother (Grandma's Hands), his primary ambition was to GET OUT! To this end, he joined the Navy at age seventeen.We follow (via snapshots and affectionate reunions) his path in the Navy (""There's a girl behind every tree in Guam!"" ""There's only two trees on the whole island!"") to his job installing toilets in airliners for McDonnell Douglas; he was a barroom singer (but only after a couple of drinks) until he managed to launch Ain't No Sunshine.From Withers' wry observations about his beginnings in the music business (""You need an intro here."" ""What's an intro?"") and the brutal effects of touring (""They wanted me to wear a gold lam&eacute; suit!""), it's very clear why he turned his back on performing and turned his focus instead, on things closer to his heart, namely his marriage and his family. Looking at his remarkable r&eacute;sum&eacute; I suspect he has made a comfortable living from the rights to his music, as his unforgetable songs have been used in numerous movies and on countless TV shows.This is an articulate fellow, obviously revered by his peers (Sting even adds his two-cents worth), his life well managed by his own solid values and by a wife with an MBA. His children are successful in their own right and it's clear how much love and respect there is in their lovely home.No, I haven't told you too much. It's a pleasure to spend some time with this fine, humorous man and you will come away with a big smile, and with an even higher regard for him as a warm, kind man. The screening I attended at NW Film Forum in Seattle concluded with an invitation to tell our friends about the movie, so I'm happy to see it's possible to buy the DVD from Amazon.",5,What's an Intro?,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,2199,"['Poet', 'composer', 'philosopher', 'husband', 'father', 'former', 'stutterer', 'performer', 'Bill', 'Withers', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'No', 'Sunshine', 'Lean', 'Me', 'profiled', 'nicely', 'edited', 'documentary', 'impression', 'exemplary', 'human', 'being', 'won', 'Grammy', '1981', 'was', 'inducted', 'Songwriters', 'Hall', 'Fame', '2005.Born', 'tiny', 'coal-mining', 'town', 'Slab', 'Fork', 'West', 'Virginia', 'Withers', 'had', 'childhood', 'shaped', 'bullied', 'cruel', 'classmates', 'supported', 'close', 'chums', 'cheered', 'beloved', 'grandmother', 'Grandma', 'Hands', 'primary', 'ambition', 'was', 'GET', 'OUT', 'end', 'joined', 'Navy', 'age', 'seventeen.We', 'follow', 'snapshots', 'affectionate', 'reunions', 'path', 'Navy', 'girl', 'tree', 'Guam', 'only', 'two', 'trees', 'whole', 'island', 'job', 'installing', 'toilets', 'airliners', 'McDonnell', 'Douglas', 'was', 'barroom', 'singer', 'only', 'couple', 'drinks', 'managed', 'launch', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'No', 'Sunshine.From', 'Withers', 'wry', 'observations', 'beginnings', 'music', 'business', 'need', 'intro', 'here', 'What', 'intro', 'brutal', 'effects', 'touring', 'wanted', 'wear', 'gold', 'lam', 'eacute', 'suit', 'very', 'clear', 'why', 'turned', 'back', 'performing', 'turned', 'focus', 'instead', 'things', 'closer', 'heart', 'namely', 'marriage', 'family', 'Looking', 'remarkable', 'r', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'suspect', 'made', 'comfortable', 'living', 'rights', 'music', 'unforgetable', 'songs', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'numerous', 'movies', 'countless', 'TV', 'shows.This', 'articulate', 'fellow', 'obviously', 'revered', 'peers', 'Sting', 'even', 'two-cents', 'worth', 'life', 'well', 'managed', 'own', 'solid', 'values', 'wife', 'MBA', 'children', 'are', 'successful', 'own', 'right', 'clear', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'respect', 'lovely', 'home.No', 'have', ""n't"", 'told', 'too', 'much', 'pleasure', 'spend', 'time', 'fine', 'humorous', 'man', 'will', 'come', 'away', 'big', 'smile', 'even', 'higher', 'regard', 'warm', 'kind', 'man', 'screening', 'attended', 'NW', 'Film', 'Forum', 'Seattle', 'concluded', 'invitation', 'tell', 'friends', 'movie', ""'m"", 'happy', 'see', 'possible', 'buy', 'DVD', 'Amazon']",Still Bill

After all, I'm pretty up on documentaries since I run a program that funds them, yet I knew nothing of this film.  I thought, ""How can that be?  It's probably not very good.""  But because I'm a huge fan of Mr. Withers, I decided to order the DVD and take a chance.  Well, I could not have been more pleased!  WHAT A TERRIFIC FILM!!! I love this man even more after watching it than I did before, which I didn't think was possible.  But he is such a great human being - so emotionally vulnerable and honest - and so caring about his family and people in general that my admiration for him grew exponentially.  I could only hope to be half as decent as he.  He's also very quick-witted and profoundly intelligent, although his modesty would likely compel him to disagree.  Spending the ninety-minutes with him while watching this film has left me with such warmth for him, his music and his very inspiring view of life.  I have dealt with many of the self-doubt and low self-esteem issues he has and to this day find myself continuing to struggle with some of them, but seeing this film has left me viewing the sky as a little bit bluer and the grass a little greener.
