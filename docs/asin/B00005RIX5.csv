Fox) who thinks she knows everything about men but is one day thrown for a loop when her seemingly perfect, trustworthy boyfriend (Morris Chestnut) is caught on a date with another woman. Fox decides to implement her 10-day punishment program, designed to get the guy down on his knees begging for forgiveness and reinstatement in the relationship. Told in intimate narration style with Fox directing her comments straight at the camera, the film never reaches its full comedic potential, but is extremely enjoyable and amply examples both the male and female side of the conundrum it is exploiting. None of the characters ever become cloying (except for David Krumholtz's annoyingly heartless stereotype of a gay male secretary), though one would wish for more scenes involving Fox's girlfriends, as they provide some real gems for the story (especially comedienne Mo'nique as the self-proclaimed &quot;Ghetto Glamour&quot; girl).

679663,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00005RIX5,D. Litton,"[5, 10]","&quot;Two Can Play That Game&quot; operates under the notion that relationships in distress call for a set of rules used to keep the opposite sex under control, only to relinquish this concept by concluding with a shot of our two main characters embracing after ninety minutes of cloyed storytelling and little to no comedic relief. But it's perfectly okay for the movie to end on a note of heavenly bliss; after all, when it comes to love, their are no rules. So why have a game? Better yet, why have this movie?The story is carried by a narration from its main character, Shante (Vivica A. Fox), an advertising executive who believes basically that all men are scum. It would appear that she has every right to hold such a belief: each of her three best friends have lousy men in their lives, while she thrives in a trusting, affectionate relationship with wealthy lawyer Keith Fenton (Morris Chestnut).Minutes after her lesson in excuses to cover up cheating ways, Shante notices her knight in shining armor out with another woman when he was supposedly &quot;working late,&quot; and so she begins her so-called &quot;10-Day Plan&quot; of games and trickery to bring him to his knees, begging her to take him back. They await phone calls from one another, make unexpected visits to each other's dwellings, avoid appearing somber in front of friends, and resort to drastic measures such as flirting and dating other people in their desperate attempts to win the other back without being the loser of the game.The movie hits a speed bump from the start with its characters, who lack any sort of charm or sparkle to keep us interested in what they have to say. Fox does her best in trying to keep a smooth flow to the cumbersome and cloyed script, but her character's narration is bothersome and intrusive, providing for long periods of dialogue that is mean-spirited when it should be funny. The sole humorous moments of the film come from the four women, who, when in one another's company, generate the kind of laughs and smiles that the film is badly in need of.Another question comes to mind when looking back on the movie: why should we care about whether or not these two people will end up together when we have no reason to embrace them as individuals? As they spend most of their time driving around in expensive cars, with Shante incessantly sneering at the camera and Keith getting his groove on with various women in a pathetic attempt to get over his lost love, we have no reason to suspect that their emotion runs deeper than their vanity. They spend so much time keeping each other at bay with their tactics, that when it comes time for them to reconcile, it's not so much a happy ending as it is just an ending, period.There are small glimpses of a better movie in &quot;Two Can Play That Game,&quot; such as the wit of the supporting female cast members and Anthony Anderson as Keith's friend and mentor, but they are buried under a massive heap of battle-of-the-sexes clich&eacute;, moronic plotting, misguided narration and unlikable characters. Sure, their lives are nice to look at on the outside, and the actors are easy on the eyes with their suave looks, but when you get right down to it, this game of love just isn't very fun, and lacks the sense of humor needed to justify the movie's near-pointless plot.",2,This &quot;Game&quot; of love and war just isn't very fun.,1010102400,"01 4, 2002",2002,3333,"['quot', 'Two', 'Can', 'Play', 'Game', 'quot', 'notion', 'distress', 'call', 'set', 'rules', 'used', 'keep', 'opposite', 'sex', 'control', 'only', 'relinquish', 'concept', 'concluding', 'shot', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'embracing', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'cloyed', 'storytelling', 'little', 'comedic', 'relief', 'perfectly', 'okay', 'movie', 'end', 'note', 'heavenly', 'bliss', 'when', 'love', 'are', 'rules', 'So', 'why', 'have', 'game', 'Better', 'yet', 'why', 'have', 'movie', 'story', 'carried', 'narration', 'main', 'character', 'Shante', 'Vivica', 'A', 'Fox', 'advertising', 'executive', 'who', 'basically', 'men', 'are', 'scum', 'would', 'appear', 'right', 'hold', 'such', 'belief', 'three', 'best', 'friends', 'have', 'lousy', 'men', 'lives', 'trusting', 'affectionate', 'relationship', 'wealthy', 'lawyer', 'Keith', 'Fenton', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'lesson', 'excuses', 'cover', 'up', 'cheating', 'ways', 'Shante', 'knight', 'shining', 'armor', 'woman', 'when', 'was', 'supposedly', 'quot', 'working', 'late', 'quot', 'so-called', 'quot', '10-Day', 'Plan', 'quot', 'games', 'trickery', 'bring', 'knees', 'begging', 'take', 'back', 'await', 'phone', 'calls', 'one', 'make', 'unexpected', 'visits', 'other', 'dwellings', 'avoid', 'appearing', 'somber', 'front', 'friends', 'resort', 'drastic', 'measures', 'such', 'flirting', 'dating', 'other', 'people', 'desperate', 'attempts', 'win', 'other', 'back', 'being', 'loser', 'game.The', 'movie', 'speed', 'bump', 'start', 'characters', 'who', 'lack', 'sort', 'charm', 'sparkle', 'keep', 'interested', 'what', 'have', 'say', 'Fox', 'best', 'trying', 'keep', 'smooth', 'flow', 'cumbersome', 'cloyed', 'script', 'character', 'narration', 'bothersome', 'intrusive', 'providing', 'long', 'periods', 'dialogue', 'mean-spirited', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'funny', 'sole', 'humorous', 'moments', 'film', 'come', 'four', 'women', 'who', 'when', 'one', 'company', 'generate', 'kind', 'laughs', 'smiles', 'film', 'badly', 'need', 'question', 'mind', 'when', 'looking', 'back', 'movie', 'why', 'should', 'care', 'not', 'two', 'people', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'when', 'have', 'reason', 'embrace', 'individuals', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'driving', 'around', 'expensive', 'cars', 'Shante', 'incessantly', 'sneering', 'camera', 'Keith', 'getting', 'groove', 'various', 'women', 'pathetic', 'attempt', 'get', 'lost', 'love', 'have', 'reason', 'suspect', 'emotion', 'deeper', 'vanity', 'spend', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'keeping', 'other', 'bay', 'tactics', 'when', 'time', 'reconcile', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'happy', 'ending', 'just', 'ending', 'are', 'small', 'glimpses', 'better', 'movie', 'quot', 'Two', 'Can', 'Play', 'Game', 'quot', 'such', 'wit', 'supporting', 'female', 'cast', 'members', 'Anthony', 'Anderson', 'Keith', 'friend', 'mentor', 'are', 'buried', 'massive', 'heap', 'battle-of-the-sexes', 'clich', 'eacute', 'moronic', 'plotting', 'misguided', 'narration', 'unlikable', 'characters', 'Sure', 'lives', 'are', 'nice', 'look', 'outside', 'actors', 'are', 'easy', 'eyes', 'suave', 'looks', 'when', 'get', 'right', 'down', 'game', 'love', 'just', ""n't"", 'very', 'fun', 'sense', 'humor', 'needed', 'justify', 'movie', 'near-pointless', 'plot']",N/A

Whoever says this movie isn't funny hasn't been in a relationship before.  Point Blank.  Through each characters strategic tactics I see myself.  I say holdup hold up ...I ve done that before.  Anthony Anderson basically makes this movie though.  This man is too funny.  He emphasizes the important words in the sentence to get his point across and his voice makes it hilarious.  This is his best acting performance.  Vivica Fox gives women a few unnecessary pointers ( from a man's perspective at least ) but she does keep it real.  Morris Chestnut does excellent as well.  The movie is fast paced as Vivica Fox and Anderson each play their cards at the situation  they are given.  They play it like a chess game and the `rules' are funny at times.  The girlfriends (Tamala Jones, Wendy Racquel Robinson and MoNique )really act like real friends and they have good chemistry together.  The movie wasn't too long and didn't bore me to death as most love stories do.When I first saw it I couldn't really understand why Morris Chestnut was moping around.  `I'm not gonna call, I already called twice, can't be desperate"" lol.

Shante takes him through a grueling three day process where she hardly even speaks to him and breaks up with him.  The only useless day was day six.  There was no purpose for it.  The funniest part is at the end when she expects him to be at her house waiting on her with flowers.  I could have told her beyotch please that aint gonna happen.  And then when he didn't show it was just hilarious.  I was like ""ahhh that shhh didn't work"" and then five seconds later she's like ""I know what ya thinking...the shhh didn't work""  By then I was on the flo rolling.

The beginning reminded me of ""The Brothers"" with views of the city and the rest of the film reminded me somewhat of ""Boomerang"".  The content however, was very funny.  I liked the way Morris Chestnut was able to exploit his ability as a comedian.  The scene after Day 5 (breezing through his office building full of confidence because he had scored an extra point) had me on the floor crying with laughter.  I was glad that the film finished with no one getting the upper edge.  The problem is that grown adults do play childish games on each other and it is such a terrible waste of life.

There were some (okay...just a few) funny scenes; esp. those featuring Bobby Brown.........Maaannn, what a transformation!!Morris Chestnut did a great job as the boyfriend (Keith) trying to stay one up w/Shante. Anthony Anderson did a good job as supporting actor playing Chestnut's good friend and &quot;relationship coach&quot;.It was interesting to see the &quot;game&quot; played in the form of a Tennis Match so to speak.  She does this then he does that. But as is evident, too much game playing proves to be childish, unwarrented and ultimately hurtful.

679695,ABE14SVILZLNY,B00005RIX5,"SID ""Punk""","[2, 3]","This would be standard middle-brow entertainment were it not for three factors that I'll discuss in a little bit. The concept, that women can be as deft &quot;players&quot; of the field as men, is certainly not new to most. It may be new to A level films, and it probably is new to director/producer Mark Brown, the creator of HOW TO BE A PLAYER. But it is not a concept new to almost any B level direct-to-video thriller, anything on Cinemax after 11pm, or to any newspaper. Women have almost always been better players (see Anna Nicole Smith, Leona Helmsley, that maid that married the Johnson &amp; Johnson fortune, and almost all of the guests on either Jerry Springer, Jenny Jones, or Ricki Lake). But, this movie does have an easy going pace and sound track that combine to make it as smooth as a ride in Shante's convertible Jaguar. What makes the film stay slightly above average is the presence of the three lead thespians. First of all, let it be said that Anthony Anderson does in fact walk away with this film. He simply owns every second that he is on screen (including the out takes at the end). His natural and easy manner combined with impeccable comic timing simply makes him the de facto owner of the material, the screen, and the film as a whole. Next, Morris Chestnut, whether given a lot or a little (like here) to do simply comes off as likable. And in the main role, few actresses - good looking or not - could carry off the part that Vivica A. Fox plays. The film would not be believable were it not for this particular actresses commanding presence and astonishing good looks. She, like her character, is someone who has worked her looks and her intelligence to get exactly what she wants out of life, and she is not afraid to show it. So, if you go in not expecting too much, you will come out pleasantly surprised.

Rachal,"[3, 4]","This is the story of a successful black woman (Shante played by Fox) who is constantly giving dating advice to her girlfriends when her man Keith (Chestnut) makes a mistake and is caught out with a pretty co-worker. Shante must implement her 10 day program which will teach a man how to get in and stay in line. At first, Keith really just wants his girlfriend back, but as he confides in a co-worker (Anderson), he gets caught up in one-uping Shante until things get completely out of control. Add to the mix Shante's friends, Deidre, Karen, and Tracee, and a rival for Keith's affections, Conny (Union), and Shante is struggling to keep things together.Fox is very sharp and savvy as Shante and the chemistry between her and Chestnut is tangible. The wardrobe is well put together and I like the fact that most of the characters in this film are successful black executives.While some of the jokes are definately targeted to the black community, this is a film that can be enjoyed by everyone because the games that are being played are not specific to any race. We've all had experiences where we waited for the other person to call first or we tried to make a partner jealous by hanging out with someone good-looking. This movie exposes the tactics that people use to gain control in a relationship and crams them together into the space of a few days.Two Can Play That Game is witty and entertaining.
