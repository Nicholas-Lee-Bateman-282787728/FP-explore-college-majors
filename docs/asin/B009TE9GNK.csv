Although sadly, the quality quickly drops. You would think that with Jill, her daughters, Doug, Silas, Shane, Stevie and Nancy would have endless family drama, instead we got a very quiet season with virtually no twists and turns which without, Weeds lost its buzz fast.I'll try to withhold spoilers for those who haven't gotten the early release of this season; the plot in this season fizzles out fast, and is re-lit for the 100th episode, ""God Willing and the Creek Don't Rise"" with lots of familiar faces from the Agrestic (now Regrestic) seasons.The series finale ended on a very flat note. It was quiet, it was odd, and trying to be spoiler free it switched things up for a poor ending that left a bad taste in my mouth. After 8 seasons of shoot outs, gangsters, cartels, trafficking, and organized crime we are treated to a rather tame finale that really doesn't resolve too many unanswered plot lines.Over all, I'm saddened that this season failed to deliver. Seasons 1-7 are great and are worthy of being some of the best TV in a while, but the 8th season turned out to be the weak link in the chain.",3,The final season limps its way to the finish line,1351123200,"10 25, 2012",2012,1539,"['first', 'TV', 'series', 'followed', 'began', 'decline', 'quality', 'second', 'season', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'Weeds', 'came', 'along', 'first', '7', 'seasons', 'was', 'rare', 'gem', 'foul-mouthed', 'weed', 'selling', 'family', 'Botwin', 'adventures', 'went', 'comical', 'murder', 'arson', 'deadly', 'betrayal', 'steamy', 'sex.The', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'Messy', 'Beam', 'Sunshine', 'provided', 'hope', 'would', 'be', 'stellar', 'send', 'Botwin', 'clan', 'sadly', 'quality', 'quickly', 'would', 'think', 'Jill', 'daughters', 'Doug', 'Silas', 'Shane', 'Stevie', 'Nancy', 'would', 'have', 'endless', 'family', 'drama', 'instead', 'got', 'very', 'quiet', 'season', 'virtually', 'twists', 'turns', 'lost', 'buzz', 'fast.I', ""'ll"", 'try', 'withhold', 'spoilers', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'early', 'release', 'season', 'plot', 'season', 'out', 'fast', 're-lit', '100th', 'episode', 'God', 'Willing', 'Creek', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Rise', 'lots', 'familiar', 'Agrestic', 'now', 'Regrestic', 'seasons.The', 'series', 'finale', 'ended', 'very', 'flat', 'note', 'was', 'quiet', 'was', 'odd', 'trying', 'be', 'spoiler', 'free', 'switched', 'things', 'up', 'poor', 'ending', 'left', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', '8', 'seasons', 'shoot', 'outs', 'gangsters', 'cartels', 'trafficking', 'organized', 'crime', 'are', 'treated', 'rather', 'tame', 'finale', 'really', ""n't"", 'resolve', 'too', 'many', 'unanswered', 'plot', ""'m"", 'saddened', 'season', 'failed', 'deliver', 'Seasons', '1-7', 'are', 'great', 'are', 'worthy', 'being', 'best', 'TV', 'while', '8th', 'season', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'weak', 'link', 'chain']",N/A

1602139,A24HCN5VCRJMTE,B009TE9GNK,Criss Spades,"[17, 25]","Season 7 was excellent. The cliff hanger that was left for viewers completely had me wanting more. I hated the year long wait into what I later learned to be the Final season of Season 8. The first 2 or 3 episodes were good. Revealing who the person was who shot Nancy was a little illogical and that trigger was pulled too early. WAY too early. I think the final season would have been better had that story line been stretched out longer. Anyway, after the resolution of Nancy's failed assassination, it all went down hill from there. The rest of the episodes fell flat, and just felt like filler episodes. The Andy-Jill story was pretty humorous to me as an upside. The series finale was seriously an awful dreadful hour of TV. Was excruciating to watch, I couldn't stop because as a long time fan, I would enjoy closure. Doug and his estranged son pretty much made that episode. It bothered me greatly that they skipped so many years for the final episode. It felt like extremely lazy writing and they didn't have anymore creative juices left. I could have written a better final season than this. All in all, this was a horrible season. The only way I recommend buying this season is if you're a longtime Weeds fan and you're trying to complete your collection or what have you. I was so saddened that this was how they chose to produce this as the final season. Explains the all time low ratings for the show.

I think this is one show you should start with the first season and work your way through to the end. With that said this had to be my favorite season yet. The humor is wonderful and the actors are the best. Its funny you look at the Botwins and they look like a family. I've grown to love this family. This season once again it is full of surprises. I'm not going to say much and spoil the fun for you. I'm amazed that they could pull this show off on TV but they did and it worked. I loved how they brought back the old theme song and got people caught up with the history of the show. They took a lot of bold chances with this to keep it fresh and once again it worked out nicely.

1602167,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B009TE9GNK,M. Bullions,"[97, 105]","For reasons that I don't understand, fans of the long-running Showtime series ""Weeds"" are divided, when it comes to the final season. I gave Season Seven of Weeds 5 stars, because I didn't want to admit that the quality had dipped drastically. If S7 were the last, I truly would have been upset. In season eight, Jenji Kohan and crew know from the beginning that it's the last season. It started out as a show primarily about family. So we get more moments with our core characters. We aren't introduced to any new cartoonish bad guys - drug dealers or gangsters. We learn to love the characters that we used to love again.And as a longtime fan who has been here since the beginning, I think it's the best way they could have ended things. For the first time in years, we get genuine character development, most of the characters redeem themselves, and we're left with a quiet and nuanced series finale that reminded me that there is some hope in the cynical world of ""Weeds"".The start of season eight shows our favorite antiheroine Nancy Botwin recovering from a possibly fatal shot to the head. Not one member of her family sheds a tear, and we're reminded how cynical and broken they are. We have yet another new location - fictitious Connecticut suburb Old Sandwich. It's a lot like Agrestic. It's interesting that the show had this big multi-location journey over eight years, to ultimately end up where they began.After a three-month recovery, Nancy vows to be a better person, after finally realizing that she's been a pretty terrible person. Stevie is back in her life, and she's trying to allow him as much of a normal life as possible. She gets out of the drug game (at least for a while), and gets a legit job, where she is still around drugs, ironically. Silas is still growing and selling pot, while Shane is preparing to be a cop in the NYPD, allowing for a new interesting dynamic between the two. Jill and her daughters have moved in with the family, and Jill almost automatically restarts her sordid romance with Andy. Even a character as despicable as Jill ultimately becomes likable in the end.The show's characters are grappling with real issues this season. Nancy, who still has a bullet lodged in her head, is wondering why she was given a second chance. She befriends a rabbi who spoke with Andy when Nancy was coma-ridden in the hospital. Andy's also wondering what the point of his life is. They're realizing that death is closer, and they contemplate religion pretty heavily, which is interesting, since religion had always been something to point and laugh at on this show. While events aren't necessarily as exciting as previous seasons may have been, we see all of the Botwins moving forward in their own lives, as they slowly drift apart from one another, into more permanent jobs and lives.While I don't want to give away too much, there are many other high points of this season. The landmark 100th episode is a return to Agrestic (now called Regrestic), where many old characters are revisited, and old wounds are opened again, and the relationship and unsaid dynamic between Andy and Nancy is finally resolved.The series finale feels very much like a reunion show, set many years in the future, where many old characters from both Agrestic and Ren Mar show up. The hour-long finale is quiet and nuanced, and not big and exciting like one would think. We see where each character is, and it's interesting to see. The ending is something that satisfied me. It isn't a happily-ever-after ending, but it's not terribly sad either. For someone who has followed this show for years, I couldn't have wanted a better ending. I thought it was beautiful, emotional and redemptive. I'm truly going to miss this show.
