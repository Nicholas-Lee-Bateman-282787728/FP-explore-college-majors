1419778,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004MCGNS0,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[54, 54]","I can, and have been, critical of Lifetime made-for-TV movies for ripping ""based on actual events"" cases from the headlines and turning them into rather lurid fodder for fictionalized dramatic recreations.  It is one of their go-to genres.  Sometimes you don't need all the media hype and sensational coverage to deliver a compelling true life story.  And in its simplicity, ""Taken from Me: The Tiffany Rubin Story"" is one of the network's more heartfelt entries into this overstuffed format.  Level-headed and real, this accounting benefits from a solidly constructed screenplay and terrifically understated performances.  In truth, it may just be the best Lifetime film that I've seen in quite some time.  And, in all candor, it is a film that I had almost no interest in seeing!  Well, I'm glad I didn't listen to myself--what do I know anyway?The wonderful Taraji P. Henson portrays Rubin.  After her ex-husband takes their son for a week long vacation, Rubin becomes alarmed when they seem to fall off the face of the earth.  Soon, it is discovered that the pair have fled the country.  There seems to be little chance of Rubin even finding her son, much less bringing him home again--and, as you might expect, this is devastating for Rubin and her family.  In a grounded story of mother love and perseverance, the boy is located and Rubin is determined that he should be brought home even if that brands her an international criminal.  The film adds a couple of unnecessary thriller elements to the concluding chapter for dramatic purposes, but never loses sight of its true strength--it has created real characters that you actually care about!Henson, as I mentioned, is perfect.  Strong, believable, and utterly real--I'm putting it out there, I think Henson should be on the shortlist for Emmy nomination consideration.  This could have been so hyper-dramatic, histrionic, and overblown--but it remains solidly rooted by natural performances.  Beverly Todd as Rubin's mother, David Jones as her current husband, and Terry O'Quinn who specializes in finding missing children are all fantastic--but this is Henson's show!  In the end, it's hard not to be moved by this dramatic recreation.  With the statistics of custodial kidnappings on the rise, this film expertly highlights one singular case.  Solidly satisfying, a definite recommendation.

Henson, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button), a New York teacher, shares a happy home life with her son, Kobe (Drew Davis), and her husband (David Haydn-Jones), but then she lets Kobe travel to Disneyworld with his Korean-American father, Jeff (Sean Baek).Her mother (Beverly Todd) disapproves of the arrangement, since Jeff has never paid child support, but Tiffany believes her ex-boyfriend has gotten his act together. Her opinion changes when she can't reach him by phone and finds his apartment empty. She seeks help from the police, who find that he's taken Kobe to South Korea, after which she contacts the FBI and meets with investigators, but they're either too slow or too expensive.In desperation, she turns to Mark Miller (Lost's Terry O'Quinn, bringing his usual gravitas) from the American Association for Lost Children. Miller recommends that she reach out to other teachers in Korea, which helps to pinpoint Kobe's location, so they take off for Seoul to bring her boy home.If they fail, they risk serious legal consequences. Henson has proven her acting chops in movies like Hustle and Flow, but she's less effective here, at least in the crying scenes, where she overdoes the theatrics (she's more believable when the tide starts to turn).
