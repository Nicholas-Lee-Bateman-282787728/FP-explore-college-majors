1497429,A1ZPVW0WXNJ3YZ,B005QIOJ3A,"Alex ""47""","[0, 0]","It came out awhile ago, but I just recently got it and finished watching the episodes and bonus features. Unlike any other DVD review I've done, I won't bother to review each individual episode this time, but I'll instead list some of season fourteen's highlights, as well as some of the duds.I can say right away that I was surprised by this season. After season 10-ish, I haven't really enjoyed any of the seasons on DVD... bland stories, weak jokes, and just general mediocrity. For season fourteen though, I was happy to find that I actually LIKED a lot of the episodes.Before watching any of the episodes, I read a lot of people's reviews complaining that Homer is beyond dumb in this season... that his IQ had dropped 30 points, and that he changed for the worse. While there are gags in some of the episodes that make Homer come off as a complete retard, most of the time the jokes were still funny to me, so the new Homer didn't bother me this season.The season as a whole is average or slightly better throughout ... I found myself rating most every episode between 3.5 and a 4.25 rating out of 5. My favorite episodes of the season include ""Treehouse of Horror XIII"" (Mostly in part to the 'Send in the Clones' bit), ""Helter Shelter"", ""The Dad Who Knew Too Little"", ""Three Gays of the Condo"", and ""Dude, Where's My Ranch?"". Those five episodes I gave 'season high' 4.25s to. The worst episode, and the only one to get a 3.25 from me, is ""Pray Anything"". It's just a boring episode with very little to chuckle at. Regardless, the season averages about a 4/5 for me. Even though I wouldn't call a single episode from this season GREAT, I'd willingly watch most of these episodes a second or third time over again.As for the bonus features, they're like the menus -- based almost entirely around Treehouse of Horror episodes from seasons past. I don't have any issues with this, but I don't understand why they haven't just released a Treehouse of Horror I-XX or XXII box set or something. I assume they'll do it at some point...The other features include the usual... commentary on every episode, art galleries, and deleted scenes. I haven't and usually don't watch episodes with commentary, so I can't comment on how they are, but apparently Matt Groening isn't in many of the episodes.Overall, The Simpsons: The Complete Fourteenth season is the best season to me since the tenth. Although nothing about this season will blow you away, you'll more than likely approve of more episodes than you disapprove.4/5",4,One of the better seasons recently released.,1343174400,"07 25, 2012",2012,2518,"['came', 'out', 'awhile', 'ago', 'just', 'recently', 'got', 'finished', 'watching', 'episodes', 'bonus', 'features', 'other', 'DVD', 'review', ""'ve"", 'done', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'review', 'individual', 'episode', 'time', ""'ll"", 'instead', 'list', 'season', 'fourteen', 'highlights', 'as', 'well', 'duds.I', 'can', 'say', 'right', 'away', 'was', 'surprised', 'season', 'season', '10-ish', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'enjoyed', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'bland', 'stories', 'weak', 'jokes', 'just', 'general', 'mediocrity', 'season', 'fourteen', 'was', 'happy', 'find', 'actually', 'lot', 'episodes.Before', 'watching', 'episodes', 'read', 'lot', 'people', 'reviews', 'complaining', 'Homer', 'dumb', 'season', 'IQ', 'had', 'dropped', '30', 'points', 'changed', 'worse', 'are', 'gags', 'episodes', 'make', 'Homer', 'come', 'off', 'complete', 'retard', 'most', 'time', 'jokes', 'were', 'still', 'funny', 'so', 'new', 'Homer', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'season.The', 'season', 'whole', 'average', 'slightly', 'better', 'found', 'rating', 'most', 'episode', '3.5', '4.25', 'rating', '5', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'season', 'include', 'Treehouse', 'Horror', 'XIII', 'Mostly', 'part', ""'Send"", 'Clones', 'bit', 'Helter', 'Shelter', 'Dad', 'Who', 'Knew', 'Too', 'Little', 'Three', 'Gays', 'Condo', 'Dude', 'Where', 'My', 'Ranch', 'five', 'episodes', 'gave', ""'season"", 'high', '4.25s', 'worst', 'episode', 'only', 'one', 'get', '3.25', 'Pray', 'Anything', 'just', 'boring', 'episode', 'very', 'little', 'chuckle', 'Regardless', 'season', 'averages', '4/5', 'Even', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'single', 'episode', 'season', 'GREAT', ""'d"", 'willingly', 'watch', 'most', 'episodes', 'second', 'third', 'time', 'again.As', 'bonus', 'features', ""'re"", 'menus', 'based', 'almost', 'entirely', 'Treehouse', 'Horror', 'episodes', 'seasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'issues', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'have', ""n't"", 'just', 'released', 'Treehouse', 'Horror', 'I-XX', 'XXII', 'box', 'set', 'something', 'assume', ""'ll"", 'do', 'point', 'other', 'features', 'include', 'usual', 'commentary', 'episode', 'art', 'galleries', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'have', ""n't"", 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'episodes', 'commentary', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'how', 'are', 'apparently', 'Matt', 'Groening', ""n't"", 'many', 'episodes.Overall', 'Simpsons', 'Complete', 'Fourteenth', 'season', 'best', 'season', 'tenth', 'nothing', 'season', 'will', 'blow', 'away', ""'ll"", 'more', 'likely', 'approve', 'more', 'episodes', 'disapprove.4/5']",The Simpsons: Season 14

However, the bonus features, which the season sets of ""The Simpsons"" were once known for, are far more lacking and much less imaginative than in previous years.  It's as if the producers of the set have stopped trying to include interesting bonuses and just slapped something together to add anything they could, as opposed to the total lack of bonus features on the released-for-the-anniversary 20th season set.

1497437,A319SKSB556033,B005QIOJ3A,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[3, 5]","The sharp decline that The Simpsons suffered in the early noughties is glaringly evident in this lackluster season. Of the 22 episodes a few are well-written and smart, a few are lazily-written and boring, and the rest are forgettable without being particularly bad. The first episode (Treehouse of Horror 13) is horrible, despite a promising opening. Things do not improve with episode 2, featuring unnaturally shoehorned-in guest appearances by The Rolling Stones and other aging rockers. We've already seen Homer interact with these types in the Season 12 episode 'A Tale of Two Springfields'. It's just an easily recycled gimmick that fails to make for a memorable episode. As for the other 20...well, when you browse through your Simpsons collection looking for a classic episode, you will never pick out Season 14.The production design of the package is lovely. Fox have gone for a Halloween theme for this one and it looks great. The Blu Ray presents each episode in 1.33:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound. There are a decent amount of extras, which are entertaining. But the best of them is the fact that disc 3 contains two Treehouse of Horror episodes (V and VI) from 1994 and 1995. These episodes are actually the best Treehouse of Horrors (V was heavily cut in the UK due to the gore and violence), and I suspect they were included to make up for the fact that the Halloween episode in Season 14 was so bad. I should also point out that Treehouse of Horror V and VI look much better on Blu Ray than their DVD counterparts, proving that earlier seasons could benefit from being released on the format. But since Fox have been releasing The Simpsons to the home video market since 2001 and are only at Season 14 I wouldn't hold your breath.",3,Foolish earthlings wrote this season,1336608000,"05 10, 2012",2012,1745,"['sharp', 'decline', 'Simpsons', 'suffered', 'early', 'noughties', 'glaringly', 'evident', 'lackluster', 'season', '22', 'episodes', 'few', 'are', 'well-written', 'smart', 'few', 'are', 'lazily-written', 'boring', 'rest', 'are', 'forgettable', 'being', 'particularly', 'bad', 'first', 'episode', 'Treehouse', 'Horror', '13', 'horrible', 'promising', 'opening', 'Things', 'do', 'not', 'improve', 'episode', '2', 'featuring', 'unnaturally', 'shoehorned-in', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'other', 'aging', 'rockers', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'Homer', 'interact', 'types', 'Season', '12', 'episode', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Springfields', 'just', 'easily', 'recycled', 'gimmick', 'make', 'memorable', 'episode', 'other', '20', 'well', 'when', 'browse', 'Simpsons', 'collection', 'looking', 'classic', 'episode', 'will', 'never', 'pick', 'out', 'Season', '14.The', 'production', 'design', 'package', 'lovely', 'Fox', 'have', 'gone', 'Halloween', 'theme', 'one', 'great', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'episode', '1.33:1', '1080p', 'DTS', 'HD-MA', 'sound', 'are', 'decent', 'amount', 'extras', 'are', 'entertaining', 'best', 'fact', '3', 'contains', 'two', 'Treehouse', 'Horror', 'episodes', 'V', 'VI', '1994', '1995', 'episodes', 'are', 'actually', 'best', 'Treehouse', 'Horrors', 'V', 'was', 'heavily', 'cut', 'UK', 'due', 'gore', 'violence', 'suspect', 'were', 'included', 'make', 'up', 'fact', 'Halloween', 'episode', 'Season', '14', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'should', 'also', 'point', 'out', 'Treehouse', 'Horror', 'V', 'VI', 'look', 'much', 'better', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'DVD', 'counterparts', 'proving', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'could', 'benefit', 'being', 'released', 'format', 'Fox', 'have', 'been', 'releasing', 'Simpsons', 'home', 'video', 'market', '2001', 'are', 'only', 'Season', '14', 'would', ""n't"", 'hold', 'breath']",The Simpsons: Season 14

I had not seen these episodes before, as i do not have/watch broadcast/cable TV. Being desperate to get a fix of one of my favorite shows, I ordered S14 not expecting much. To my surprise, the quality of this season is an improvement over the last 2 seasons- and a big improvement over season 13.The commentaries (one of my favorite features of the DVDs- and alone worth buying the DVDs for) are again relevant and entertaining (In S13, they seemed like they had stopped caring and had run out of steam...but thankfully, these commentaries on S14 are as good as ever).This was the first year they went digital, as far as the actual animation goes...and I have to say, that it looks great.  While this season may still not be up to the standards of seasons 2-10, it is definitely getting back on track. The absurd plots of the last few seasons are gone; The disjointed separate ""A"" and ""B"" stories are gone- with each episode now centered around one unified storyline.Homer's annoying screaming and bumbling are largely gone (Thank you!)....and many of the things we loved about the classic seasons have returned- like the inclusion of many of our favorite secondary characters.Still, the show is a little flat compared to the classic years; It is not as funny as it once was...and much of the good intellectual humor is still missing...but this is a vast improvement over the crapfest which the show had become over the last few seasons.I can only hope that this trend continues with season 15- and maybe there will yet be some good seasons of the Simpsons to come, which rival the quality of earlier seasons. (If only they'd release seasons in a timelier manner!)So if you have been put off by the declining quality of the past few seasons...cheer up and give this season a try- it is on the rebound! Sure, other than the commentaries, there isn't much in the way of worthwhile extras (But who cares? We have good commentary on EVERY episode!) and they're still packaging this show in the abhorrent cardboard accordion ruin-a-disc  cases (at least now they've got little cheesy plastic baggies over the DVDs to protect them from scratches).....but [in Krusty voice] Whadduyah gonna do?After season 13, seeing this season was a relief!

1497450,A1QWGA44V1B1E8,B005QIOJ3A,"Nick Lombardi ""Nick_Name""","[6, 14]","I'm giving the entire Simpsons TV series two stars: Five stars for the first six seasons, and one star for the subsequent 17. Those of you reading this who are under the age of 20 or 25, I don't really expect you to understand. You are, after all, very loyal to a show that's been around as long as you have, and you also may not have been exposed to their ""golden years."" You also did not experience the thrill of waiting anxiously for Thursday night to come around so that you and your family could gather around the TV at 8:00 for what was almost guaranteed to be a non-stop laugh fest every single week. These were the days before reality TV, when families actually could have ""family time"" in front of the TV without the idea of marrying the words ""TV"" and ""family time"" being absolutely repulsive.Back when The Simpsons aired Thursdays at 8:00, I would always keep my little eye on the digital clock on our VCR, and when 8:20 and 8:25 came around, I would get a little bit sad because I knew my show was almost over for another week. Flash forward 15 years, and I'm looking at the clock to see how much longer before this crap finishes.I don't mean to sound like a nostalgic ""in my day"" old man (I'm only 30, after all), but I feel I have to stress the importance of nostalgia when talking about this show because without an understanding of that, you young readers cannot understand what this show meant to us. It was, at one time, one of the smartest, funniest, most daring and wittiest show ever written.Never in my life have I seen a show go from being one of the greatest TV show of all time to being one of the worst. Such a drastic swing in quality is almost unheard of. But that's what The Simpsons has done. Watching The Simpsons now is like watching your favorite uncle dying of cancer on his deathbed...he was the life of the party once, and now he is reduced to merely a shadow of his former self, one that you can't help mourn. Make no mistake about it: this show has died. Don't think for a second that it will ever be revived. You are lucky to laugh twice in an entire 30 minutes. Back when this show was in its prime, you could count on laughing twice before the opening credits were completed.If you haven't done so, PLEASE go back and watch the first couple of seasons. Forget that their voices sound a little shakier, or that the animation was not as polished. Look at the content. Because you Family Guy generations haven't got a clue. You are mistaking shock value with comedy. ""Shock"" can be funny sometimes, but ultimately it's a lazy way to get some cheap laughs. You will laugh, but you will never experience the deep-down laugh of pure satisfaction...all you are getting is ""junk food"" laughs: the crap that gets the job done on a superficial level but which doesn't quite touch that deep-down place, the crap that you feel guilty and a little bit hollow for laughing at afterwards.

This is a show that just recently aired its 500th episode. Not every show will be a work of art...I take the Simpsons for what it is...a very culturally aware piece of pop satire that considers nothing sacred and explores different ways to achieve what it sets out to do constantly. Granted, I haven't been absolutely in love with every single episode, but to ask that would be impossible. One episode of ""M*A*S*H"" that that show's cast all seemed to love was an episode called ""Dreams""...and it was one of my least favorites ever. Again, another long running series that had its own groundbreaking episodes as well for its time. I enjoy watching The Simpsons to this day and like many other fans, I sure do wish they'd catch up on the DVD season releases. There are still seasons 15 through 19 plus 21 and 22 that a lot of people would love to buy...but as somsone else said, the reason those aren't out yet is probably the syndication value of those seasons (translated: if they were available now, people wouldn't have to tune into the reruns to see them). I will say, however, that after receiving my copy in the mail, that this has some of the worst packaging I've seen yet. You have to physically pull the discs out from a cardboard sleeve that practically begs you to rip it just to get at the disc, and the sleeve is a fold-out that holds all four DVDs. I gave up and put the discs into four of those little white CD envelopes from Staples and ut them back into the box the collection comes in along with the booklet. We shouldn't have to fight to get to the DVDs we paid good money for.",4,About time...(revised review after receiving this in the mail),1332547200,"03 24, 2012",2012,1798,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Simpsons', 'beginning', 'however', 'do', 'think', 'lot', 'self-proclaimed', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'are', 'just', 'nitpicking', 'perceptions', 'quality', 'show', 'later', 'seasons', 'show', 'just', 'recently', 'aired', '500th', 'episode', 'Not', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'work', 'art', 'take', 'Simpsons', 'what', 'very', 'culturally', 'aware', 'piece', 'pop', 'satire', 'nothing', 'sacred', 'different', 'ways', 'achieve', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'constantly', 'Granted', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'absolutely', 'love', 'single', 'episode', 'ask', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'One', 'episode', 'M*A*S*H', 'show', 'cast', 'all', 'seemed', 'love', 'was', 'episode', 'called', 'Dreams', 'was', 'one', 'least', 'favorites', 'ever', 'Again', 'long', 'running', 'series', 'had', 'own', 'groundbreaking', 'episodes', 'well', 'time', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Simpsons', 'day', 'many', 'other', 'fans', 'sure', 'do', 'wish', ""'d"", 'catch', 'up', 'DVD', 'season', 'releases', 'are', 'still', 'seasons', '15', '19', '21', '22', 'lot', 'people', 'would', 'love', 'buy', 'somsone', 'else', 'said', 'reason', 'are', ""n't"", 'out', 'yet', 'probably', 'syndication', 'value', 'seasons', 'translated', 'were', 'available', 'now', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'tune', 'reruns', 'see', 'will', 'say', 'however', 'receiving', 'copy', 'mail', 'worst', 'packaging', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'yet', 'have', 'physically', 'pull', 'discs', 'out', 'cardboard', 'sleeve', 'practically', 'rip', 'just', 'get', 'disc', 'sleeve', 'fold-out', 'four', 'DVDs', 'gave', 'up', 'put', 'discs', 'four', 'little', 'white', 'CD', 'envelopes', 'Staples', 'ut', 'back', 'box', 'collection', 'booklet', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'fight', 'get', 'DVDs', 'paid', 'good', 'money']",The Simpsons: Season 14
