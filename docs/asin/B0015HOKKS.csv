1149479,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B0015HOKKS,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[3, 3]","When Did You Last See Your Father, tear jerker supreme. The movie plods along very slowly. So slowly that you actually can go off, make an onion and sugar sandwich, come back and not miss anything. It's a very predictable film, you know the father played by Jim Broadbent is going to die. The flashbacks are interspersed just about where you would expect.It's all very neat and tidy. But there's kind of a rub with the film. Somehow we hear that Blake, played by Colin Firth, doesn't like his father. Actually hadn't spoken to him in a very long time. And we see these loving, beautiful flashbacks with his father being a very good father - spending time with his son. So I definately didn't buy this dislike. Just couldn't put myself in those shoes of distance.Was it the supposed or imagined affair his father had that made Blake hate his father. In the end, we don't really ever know. Blake never gets confirmation that his father really had an affair. We also have to imagine, did Blake really sleep with his first love near the end of the film? So father and son, not so different.I give the film 3 stars because, well I fell for the ending. It actually ressurected a slow movie. There's a few twists at the end and the real question Blake asks himself, when did you last see your father, is answered rather beautifully.The DVD has 8 minutes of deleted scenes. And they are deleted for a good reason. The last deleted scene is particularly bad.The performances by Colin Firth and Jim Broadbent are wonderful - they also bring the rating up. The filming is gorgeous. The landscapes never looked more beautiful. The sound was just passable, nothing good or really bad about it (and that is a bit of a problem). And I loved the cars in this film - the opening sequence at the race track in the 50's, that silver convertible, and the supporting cast of cars.If you are ready for a good cry, rent this film.

1149480,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B0015HOKKS,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[1, 1]","""When Did You Last See Your Father?""(2008)----------------------------------------------This is a thoughtful, multi-layered drama about a middle-aged man coming to terms with his father's death, and the termination of their rocky father-son relationship.  Jim Broadbent is brilliant as the father, an irascible, self-centered (but often charming) curmudgeon who uses his strong personality and social skills to dominate and belittle his son, constantly criticizing him and discounting his accomplishments. The story is told in flashbacks, with Colin Firth as the adult son, and well-matched by the other actors who play him in younger years.The son's memories are painful and sharp, but as the film goes on, we see that his perceptions are not always to be trusted, and indeed, on reexamining the childhood incidents that helped shape his life, he realizes with adult hindsight that perhaps all is not what it seems. The emotional core of this nuanced film is made all the more powerful by the closing scenes in which the father dies at home -- the scenes of homecare and dealing with the sick and the dying are not images often explored in our culture, and may be uncomfortable for some, cathartic for others.  A fine film, with excellent performances throughout.

1149481,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0015HOKKS,Grady Harp,"[19, 20]","Based on an autobiographical memoir by Blake Morrison WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE YOUR FATHER? is a finely wrought exploration into the delicate issues that both separate and bind fathers and sons.  It is difficult for viewers whose fathers are gone not to relate to the profound tenderness and at times difficult reminiscences of their own relationships that remain as both warm and haunting dreams.  David Nicholls' adaptation of Morrison's book stresses the character development of both father and son (and the rest of this British family) allowing us to understand the dilemma that faces the main character as he is asked the question that forms the title of this film.Blake Morrison (Colin Firth) is happily married to Kathy (Gina McKee) and is a successful writer/poet who is preparing to receive an award for his contributions to literature. Present at his ceremony is his father Dr. Arthur Morrison (Jim Broadbent) who is a unique egomaniac whose personality traits affect everyone around him - both positively and negatively. After Blake's acceptance speech his father cannot even manage to say 'well done', instead  furthers his comments about Blake's silly decision not to go into medicine and strive instead for the poor life of a writer.  A medical emergency tosses Arthur into the hospital, he is diagnosed with terminal cancer: the remainder of the film is a series of vignettes of Blake at his father's bedside accompanied by his mother Kim (Juliet Stephenson) coupled with flashbacks to Blake's childhood (Matthew Beard plays Blake as a teenager) memories that contain moments of confusing father/son incidents as well as Blake's long standing loathing of his fathers affairs with other women such as 'Aunt Beaty' (Sarah Lancashire) and others.  As Arthur falls more deeply toward dying, Blake attempts to confront his father with his lifelong perceptions and grievances and the manner in which Blake comes to grips with his feelings for his father completes this film.Director Anand Tucker orchestrates this story beautifully, blending the gorgeous English countryside with just the right timing between momentary flashbacks and flash forwards to make this film flow and glow with nostalgia.  The musical score by Barrington Pheloung  wisely incorporates a lovely rendition of Bellini's 'Casta diva' from 'Norma', Bach's G Minor Piano Concerto, and a Schubert trio, which add a timeless dimension to the mood of the film.  Jim Broadbent brings off this challenging role with great artistry, as does Colin Firth with his role as Blake.  But then the entire cast is well selected from some of England's finest actors.  This is an emotional film, a film  that will touch men especially, but will also bring resonance with women.

In the film, Mr. Broadbent's character (the father) has a lifelong affair with another woman, occasionally calls his son 'fat-head' and exposes other human flaws, but other than that appears to be an involved and caring father.

Some things are implied and sometimes I was left in question whether the event occurred or not. I didn't like the portrayal that he is loyal to his family-wife and young kids--only to go to his family home and daydream about re-living some lust that he shared with this family's young housekeeper.~I didn't see the point--maybe he's drawing a parallel to his father's life...to show a devoted cheating father? Though...I wouldn't have minded him getting up from the tub :) haha~ I hated the stand-by-your cheating man version of his mother and the disrespect his father showed his wife...even when she was equivalent in education, as I resume she was also a doctor in her own right--by having his mistress (AUNT BEATY) always in HER home, flaunting this affair and exposing his children to all that... and was Josie truly the product of his father and Aunt Beaty? It would've been nice if Colin Firth's character manned up and confronted his childhood fears and these questions toward his father. It would've been nice if this continued frontal level of disrespect toward his mother would've been due to her own indiscretions or devotion to her own work/occupations. But in the end it only showed she stayed because she loved him...that was a little lame. Too bad Firth's character didn't have the passion to devote to his own present circumstance over the memories of his past. It would've been nice to see the young character charm better than his dad that young girl during their vacation. I actually thought his dad was going to bed the young girl and I would've been bummed for the teenage boy.

When father is diagnosed with cancer, his son goes through a flashback of the events from his early adolescence that explains the strained relationship between father and son.  Father had a greater than life personality, while son was more introverted and emotional.  Long time ago indiscretions commited by the father seem irreconcilable to the son.  His attempt to get answers is impeded by the terrible sickness that seems to take over the situation.It is a touching story about parent child relationship.  It is also a story about grief and the fact that sometimes we would rather have our parents around so we can hate them then loose them to death and life long sorrow for not being able to have them around ourselves except in our memories.Wonderful cast of very fine British actors.

1149492,A35DI28HRSEEP6,B0015HOKKS,Richard B. Schwartz,"[2, 2]","Jim Broadbent is one of our greatest living actors and he is incapable of giving a bad performance.  This is a difficult role for him, since the character he plays is radically flawed and not particularly likeable.  The story concerns his son's attempts to reconnect with him as he approaches death.  It is told in flashbacks and it is touching in moments and beautifully filmed throughout.  The problem is that it lacks a clear structure, a plot arc that successfully shapes the action and effects an emotional and intellectual response.  With such an arc, each scene advances the action and multiplies its impact.  Here the story meanders and the emotional interplay of the characters fails to reach a satisfactory, layered conclusion.  As some of the Amazon reviewers have noted, the film will not lack an audience because many would watch Colin Firth reading the phone book.  I don't think one should miss any performance by Broadbent, but to see him at the absolute top of his form, see Topsy-Turvy.  Firth is an actor with more range than some give him credit for; see him in the very interesting film, The Advocate.",3,Worth seeing for Broadbent,1233964800,"02 7, 2009",2009,1122,"['Jim', 'Broadbent', 'one', 'greatest', 'living', 'actors', 'incapable', 'giving', 'bad', 'performance', 'difficult', 'role', 'character', 'radically', 'flawed', 'not', 'particularly', 'likeable', 'story', 'son', 'attempts', 'reconnect', 'death', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'touching', 'moments', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'problem', 'clear', 'structure', 'plot', 'arc', 'successfully', 'action', 'effects', 'emotional', 'intellectual', 'response', 'such', 'arc', 'scene', 'action', 'impact', 'Here', 'story', 'meanders', 'emotional', 'interplay', 'characters', 'fails', 'reach', 'satisfactory', 'layered', 'conclusion', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'lack', 'audience', 'many', 'would', 'watch', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'reading', 'phone', 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'one', 'should', 'miss', 'performance', 'Broadbent', 'see', 'absolute', 'top', 'form', 'see', 'Topsy-Turvy', 'Firth', 'actor', 'more', 'range', 'give', 'credit', 'see', 'very', 'interesting', 'film', 'Advocate']",When Did You Last See Your Father?
1149493,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B0015HOKKS,Robert J. Crawford,"[8, 8]","Having recently lost my father, I hoped that this film would help me to look into our relationship, to grieve, to let my feelings come to the fore in private, for myself beyond the (very helpful) rituals we have of letting go.  Although the film relationship was of course very different from the one I had with my father, it brilliantly addresses the universal issues between fathers and sons:  there are so many memories - of fun, perceived slights, love, and anger - that swirl in the mind for the rest of the son's life.  The son, Blake,  has questions he wants to resolve, yet they can't really talk about them, even as his father lies on his deathbed.  Blake struggles with disappointment in his charming and manipulative father, whose flaws and strengths, whose caring and occasional carelessness, remain present in his imagination every single day, with the specificity of recall you would expect of a poet.  It is so primal in love, so raw in striving and competition, as the son takes his own path and the father is left behind yet still living within him.The father's last days are also portrayed with painful intimacy.  Unless one has experienced it, it is hard to comprehend what it is like to watch a parent slip away as the body fails, yet this film portrays it with realism and empathy, with fabulously nuanced acting.You see the father as a great spirit, as a selfish jerk, as a charmer of ""other"" women, as a joker indulgent of his son's desires, as the only  person who can give certain things, as full of his own needs yet caring.  It is funny, sad, enraging, and loving all at the same time.  These emotions washed over me as I watched this film, truly a cathartic experience that reduced me at times to tears.This is a mature film, a masterpiece that approaches the complexity of life.  Blake too is a flawed character, though his life is more or less on track.  THe film ends with a wonderfully ambiguous optimism, summing up the exasperation and love all at the same moment.  The mother is also subtly present, though not at the center of the story.  In my view, the balance was right.Warmly recommended.  But do not expect a comedy - it is painful and uplifting realism at its best.",5,"sensitive portrayal of that most difficult of relationships, father-son",1258243200,"11 15, 2009",2009,2207,"['Having', 'recently', 'lost', 'father', 'hoped', 'film', 'would', 'help', 'look', 'relationship', 'grieve', 'let', 'feelings', 'come', 'fore', 'private', 'very', 'helpful', 'rituals', 'have', 'letting', 'go', 'film', 'relationship', 'was', 'course', 'very', 'different', 'one', 'had', 'father', 'brilliantly', 'universal', 'issues', 'fathers', 'sons', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'memories', 'fun', 'perceived', 'slights', 'love', 'anger', 'swirl', 'mind', 'rest', 'son', 'life', 'son', 'Blake', 'questions', 'resolve', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'talk', 'even', 'father', 'deathbed', 'Blake', 'disappointment', 'charming', 'manipulative', 'father', 'flaws', 'strengths', 'caring', 'occasional', 'carelessness', 'remain', 'present', 'imagination', 'single', 'day', 'specificity', 'recall', 'would', 'expect', 'poet', 'so', 'primal', 'love', 'so', 'raw', 'striving', 'competition', 'son', 'own', 'path', 'father', 'left', 'yet', 'still', 'living', 'him.The', 'father', 'last', 'days', 'are', 'also', 'portrayed', 'painful', 'intimacy', 'one', 'experienced', 'hard', 'comprehend', 'what', 'watch', 'parent', 'slip', 'away', 'body', 'yet', 'film', 'realism', 'empathy', 'fabulously', 'nuanced', 'acting.You', 'see', 'father', 'great', 'spirit', 'selfish', 'jerk', 'charmer', 'other', 'women', 'joker', 'indulgent', 'son', 'desires', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'give', 'certain', 'things', 'full', 'own', 'needs', 'yet', 'caring', 'funny', 'sad', 'enraging', 'loving', 'same', 'time', 'emotions', 'washed', 'over', 'watched', 'film', 'truly', 'cathartic', 'experience', 'reduced', 'times', 'tears.This', 'mature', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'complexity', 'life', 'Blake', 'too', 'flawed', 'character', 'life', 'more', 'less', 'track', 'THe', 'film', 'wonderfully', 'ambiguous', 'optimism', 'summing', 'up', 'exasperation', 'love', 'same', 'moment', 'mother', 'also', 'subtly', 'present', 'not', 'center', 'story', 'view', 'balance', 'was', 'right.Warmly', 'recommended', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'comedy', 'painful', 'uplifting', 'realism', 'best']",When Did You Last See Your Father?

Look for him in the future.As for the film, it is one of those movies that will touch you if you had a father that you always wanted to talk to but never had the opportunity, for whatever reason.
