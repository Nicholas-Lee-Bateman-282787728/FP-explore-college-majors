1607011,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B00A92MG88,Andres C. Salama,"[0, 1]","A Western couple (played by Gael Garcia Bernal, who is actually Mexican and Hani Furstenberg, who is an Israeli) decide to hike in the Caucasus Mountains of the country of Georgia, taking as a guide a local man (Bidzina Gujabidze). The audience can see from the start that the guide is a bit of a screw loose, and that something nasty is going to happen to them, but they seem oblivious to it. I will not reveal more of the plot. I thought that this will be terribly self-indulgent (and many in the audience will feel that) but I find myself surprised in the first half of the movie for liking the film. However, something happens halfway, and the movie takes a wrong turn, not completely, but the second half of the film becomes not very believable and slow and quite a drag. Russian born Julia Loktev (why doesn&#8217;t she wants to be called by her real name, Yulia Lokteva) directs. The rough outdoor beauty of Georgia certainly helps (I know this is a clich&eacute;, but the land really becomes one of the characters of the film).",2,"Starts better than expected, but the movie disappoints by the end",1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,1035,"['Western', 'couple', 'played', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'who', 'actually', 'Mexican', 'Hani', 'Furstenberg', 'who', 'Israeli', 'decide', 'hike', 'Caucasus', 'Mountains', 'country', 'Georgia', 'taking', 'guide', 'local', 'man', 'Bidzina', 'Gujabidze', 'audience', 'can', 'see', 'start', 'guide', 'bit', 'screw', 'loose', 'something', 'nasty', 'going', 'happen', 'seem', 'oblivious', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'more', 'plot', 'thought', 'will', 'be', 'terribly', 'self-indulgent', 'many', 'audience', 'will', 'feel', 'find', 'surprised', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'liking', 'film', 'However', 'something', 'halfway', 'movie', 'wrong', 'turn', 'not', 'completely', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'not', 'very', 'believable', 'slow', 'quite', 'drag', 'Russian', 'born', 'Julia', 'Loktev', 'why', 'doesn', '8217', 'be', 'called', 'real', 'name', 'Yulia', 'Lokteva', 'rough', 'outdoor', 'beauty', 'Georgia', 'certainly', 'know', 'clich', 'eacute', 'land', 'really', 'one', 'characters', 'film']",The Loneliest Planet
1607012,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00A92MG88,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 3]","I'm going to say right away that `The Loneliest Planet' is not going to be a film for everyone.  It is very slow moving and far more observational than anything else.  It is going to bore quite a few and is going to feel almost too slight in its progression of themes for some, but for those who embrace the minimalist approach, `The Loneliest Planet' is going to be a true gem.Julia Loktev's stunning film (the cinematography is nearly unmatched) tells the story of Nica and Alex, an engaged couple who are backpacking through the Caucasus Mountains.  They have a guide named Dato who is showing them the way and they are basically soaking in nature and each other before saying their vows.  While all seems well, a slight misunderstanding turns ugly and a singular mistake causes a riff between the couple that threatens to destroy their relationship.  It is in that one moment that so much about these two is exposed, and while the moment passes without physical tragedy, the emotional damage is already done.The film is extremely subtle, even in that big moment, for it presents us with the tension and then dispels it without making it into some melodramatic experience.  It is frightening and tense and then ultimately a mere bump in the road.  What makes `The Loneliest Planet' so impactful is the way it allows those moments to settle in a very natural light.  Hani Furstenberg and Gael Garcia Bernal (about time he comes back with something noteworthy) are both extremely good here.  Furstenberg is especially moving in her emotional conundrum in the later part of the film, and the way that her character's expressions and dilemma is explored with such restraint is beautifully rendered.This is a quiet film, but it speaks volumes.",5,Silence is golden...,1366070400,"04 16, 2013",2013,1741,"[""'m"", 'going', 'say', 'right', 'away', 'Loneliest', 'Planet', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'film', 'everyone', 'very', 'slow', 'moving', 'far', 'more', 'observational', 'anything', 'else', 'going', 'bore', 'quite', 'few', 'going', 'feel', 'almost', 'too', 'slight', 'progression', 'themes', 'who', 'embrace', 'minimalist', 'approach', 'Loneliest', 'Planet', 'going', 'be', 'true', 'gem.Julia', 'Loktev', 'stunning', 'film', 'cinematography', 'nearly', 'unmatched', 'story', 'Nica', 'Alex', 'engaged', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'backpacking', 'Caucasus', 'Mountains', 'have', 'guide', 'named', 'Dato', 'who', 'showing', 'way', 'are', 'basically', 'soaking', 'nature', 'other', 'saying', 'vows', 'well', 'slight', 'misunderstanding', 'ugly', 'singular', 'mistake', 'riff', 'couple', 'destroy', 'relationship', 'one', 'moment', 'so', 'much', 'two', 'exposed', 'moment', 'physical', 'tragedy', 'emotional', 'damage', 'already', 'done.The', 'film', 'extremely', 'subtle', 'even', 'big', 'moment', 'tension', 'then', 'dispels', 'making', 'melodramatic', 'experience', 'frightening', 'tense', 'then', 'ultimately', 'mere', 'bump', 'road', 'What', 'Loneliest', 'Planet', 'so', 'impactful', 'way', 'moments', 'settle', 'very', 'natural', 'light', 'Hani', 'Furstenberg', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'time', 'back', 'something', 'noteworthy', 'are', 'extremely', 'good', 'here', 'Furstenberg', 'especially', 'moving', 'emotional', 'conundrum', 'later', 'part', 'film', 'way', 'character', 'expressions', 'dilemma', 'explored', 'such', 'restraint', 'beautifully', 'rendered.This', 'quiet', 'film', 'volumes']",The Loneliest Planet
1607013,A3IVBYIDNMPEPO,B00A92MG88,Chococat,"[1, 2]","I agree with the other reviewers that this film is not mainstream. The fact that it's an indie film perhaps makes that obvious. What's not obvious is the quiet that speaks volumes. Not a lot of dialogue, barely any. Enough though.This couple has the relationship we all want and envy. Intimate, close, perfectly paired.  I kept thinking who would they find to fit so well. They would never find what they have with each other:  Inside jokes, mutual relaxed fun, extreme intimacy and knowledge of each other's habits and wants, anticipating each others needs, never bored, always close and always taking care of the other without question. Giving and receiving to each other without question. Until...I think the message of this movie is that you never really know someone. Or, the person and yourself isn't exactly what you thought. And when you see a chink...in the person or in yourself, what do you do about it? What does it mean for the relationship. Is he/she who you thought? Are you? Was everything else a lie because of the chink. Is the chink really a chasm?This movie made me feel and think. I felt for each character separately. It created the ability for us to have empathy for each person, and feel agony, shame, and loneliness. As a bonus, the setting was gorgeous, and we got a key hole into the Georgian culture and unrest.",5,Worth seeing if you are into Indie films.

1607015,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00A92MG88,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 3]","""The Loneliest Planet"" is one of those tiny indie films where not much happens and just about everything of import is occurring silently within the main character's psyche. As such, it may not appeal to all audiences. Long stretches of the picture are without dialogue as the camera gets up close to its subject and just sort of lingers there. I like an introspective character piece as much as the next person, but let's be honest. Some of these pictures can be downright dull. Something has to connect on an emotional level, some sort of identification, in order to get much meaning from these narrative studies. And as ""The Loneliest Planet"" began, I was only mildly hopeful that I would get much satisfaction from the film. Let's just say that Julia Loktev's feature requires a great deal of patience but, for the most part, that patience is rewarded.Gael Garcia Bernal and Hani Furstenberg play an engaged couple planning a trek through the desolate mountains of Georgia (the country, not the state). Truthfully, the camera is a voyeur that just sort of eavesdrops of the duo as they go about their daily adventures. They seem carefree enough, living for the moment. They share little flirtations, small jokes, and not much conversation. They simply exist, taking small pleasures where they can. You don't get much personal information about them, you just get this surface view of who they are. They take on a guide (Bidzini Gujabidze) for their rather lengthy journey cross country. As you might start to wonder if ""The Loneliest Planet"" is really heading anywhere, one moment will change everything. One instinctual move will cause the couple to reflect on everything they once thought was solid. But while the occurrence raises many questions, once again--the screenplay and its characters never really verbalize what has happened. You see the rifts developing internally.The DVD is covered with soaring praise from many of the country's top critics, but I caution that this is NOT a film that will have much appeal to the typical mainstream movie goer. The performances are very natural and the Caucasus Mountains scenery can be quite lovely. The movie is a slow mood piece. There aren't big dramatic moments or easy resolutions, so you simply have to let the experience wash over you at its own pace. In the end, as I said, not much happens from a plotting standpoint. But I appreciated the incredibly subtle choices that told the story. And while I thought the film was time well spent, it is not something that I would freely recommend to everyone.

1607020,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00A92MG88,M. Oleson,"[2, 4]","I knew virtually nothing about this movie but for some reason it looked kinda' interesting so I took a flyer.  The film opens with Nica (Hani Furstenberg) a svelte young woman jumping up and down, as if on a trampoline, but...she's totally nude and covered in water.  The film goes downhill from there.Nica was trying to keep warm I guess waiting for her fianc&eacute;, Alex (Gael Garcia Bernal) to give her the final cold water rinse.  The pair, world travelers, are in the Republic of Georgia and have hired a guide to take them hiking and camping in the Caucasus Mountains.  So now I'm wondering what this is all about.  Is this vampire country?  Are we going the way of sex slavery?  Well for the first 40 minutes or so we see the loving couple and their husky local observe the beautiful topography and vistas of the mountains.  Certainly nothing wrong with that if you are expecting a travelogue.Things change and I perked up when 3 Georgians confront the guide and the couple.  The guide and the locals get into a big argument, but unless you speak the language (no subtitles here) you would have to guess.  Suddenly one of the couples says something and it changes everything, for everybody.  I shouldn't give it away because that is what the film is about I guess.  Do the couple really know each other, especially in a crisis?  I stayed focus on trying to figure out what the locals were so pissed off about.  We never learn.  The guide who has limited English doesn't explain.  Maybe I'm the only one who didn't get it.  The journey continues for the trio but it's all quiet between them.  That's about it.Directed and co-written (with Tom Bissell) by Julia Loktev, this film is just bizarre nonsense.

For example, I have no idea how the title of this movie has anything to do with it. A lot of things in this film are confounding to me.*********SPOILER ALERT*********But most of all, in the most important scene of the movie, we never learn why the young boy was agitated, why the old man put a gun to the head of Alex, why it took so long for the guide to intervene, if he even did. Most important, why the guide was asked about it afterwards, briefly, but never replied.That crucial scene, the one that gives the second half of the movie its reason for existence, is inexplicably unexplained.I thought Alex acted normally during the scene. When the rifle first came out, he instinctively put Nica in front of him. Not the height of chivalry, of course, but self preservation instincts taking over, I guess. Then he quickly realized what he had to do, to shield Nica, and he stepped in front of her. He then didn't bawl, cringe or bargain. He stood, awaiting his fate, maybe hoping the rifle had only one bullet in it, for him only.If Nica was disappointed in her to-be husband, and she was, she conveyed it through silence and separation. (Quite a useful communication skill there. One, fortunately, my wife never learned. Partly why we're married 44 years.) Alex tried to bring her back, but she made it much too hard for him.Instead of Alex and Nica talking it out, the dialogue we do get are dumb jokes about birth control in China.I thought this movie had the chance to be quite good. ""All"" it needed was a plot, editing (especially editing), and dialogue.A half-star for the pluck of the actress playing Nica -- looked like a LOT of hiking -- and another for the remarkable Georgian landscape.I kept hoping the loose ends, like the guide's string tricks, would be tied together. They never were.This movie is a good litmus test for deciding which professional reviewers share our taste. Some loved this movie, some thoroughly disliked it.

1607024,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B00A92MG88,Westley,"[10, 17]","In ""The Loneliest Planet,"" a young engaged couple -- Alex (Gael Garcia Bernal) and Nica (Hani Furstenberg) -- take a hiking trip across the Caucus Mountains in the Republic of Georgia (not the southern state).  They hire a local guide, Dato (played by Bidzina Gujabize who is an actual Georgian hiking guide) and joyfully trek into the wilderness.  The trio get along well, with Alex and Nica enjoying young love and Dato teaching them Georgian.  But then something unexpected happens that completely changes the tenor of the couple's relationship.The movie is slow paced and likely to turn off many people who are looking for a thriller.  There is not much plot or dialogue, with numerous stretches simply following the trio as they hike.  The movie is beautiful to look at -- a bit of a Georgian travelogue -- but again not enough to hold the attention.  However, what the movie excels at is depicting the couple.  Bernal and Furstenberg have amazing chemistry together, and the movie shows the small things that demonstrate the strength and closeness of their relationship, such as their contest to see who can stand on their heads longer.  Silly stuff.When the plot twist occurs (be forewarned that it is not a huge shocking twist), we instantly see how it has changed them.  The three main leads' naturalistic acting is tremendous, and the movie subtly examines big topics such as trust and masculinity.  That it does so without a plethora of dialogue is all the more impressive.",4,Three is the loneliest number,1357344000,"01 5, 2013",2013,1484,"['Loneliest', 'Planet', 'young', 'engaged', 'couple', 'Alex', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'Nica', 'Hani', 'Furstenberg', 'take', 'hiking', 'trip', 'Caucus', 'Mountains', 'Republic', 'Georgia', 'not', 'southern', 'state', 'hire', 'local', 'guide', 'Dato', 'played', 'Bidzina', 'Gujabize', 'who', 'actual', 'Georgian', 'hiking', 'guide', 'joyfully', 'trek', 'wilderness', 'trio', 'get', 'along', 'well', 'Alex', 'Nica', 'enjoying', 'young', 'love', 'Dato', 'teaching', 'Georgian', 'then', 'something', 'unexpected', 'completely', 'tenor', 'couple', 'relationship.The', 'movie', 'slow', 'paced', 'likely', 'turn', 'off', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'thriller', 'not', 'much', 'plot', 'dialogue', 'numerous', 'stretches', 'simply', 'following', 'trio', 'hike', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'look', 'bit', 'Georgian', 'travelogue', 'again', 'not', 'enough', 'hold', 'attention', 'However', 'what', 'movie', 'excels', 'depicting', 'couple', 'Bernal', 'Furstenberg', 'have', 'amazing', 'chemistry', 'together', 'movie', 'small', 'things', 'demonstrate', 'strength', 'closeness', 'relationship', 'such', 'contest', 'see', 'who', 'can', 'stand', 'heads', 'longer', 'Silly', 'plot', 'twist', 'be', 'forewarned', 'not', 'huge', 'shocking', 'twist', 'instantly', 'see', 'how', 'changed', 'three', 'main', 'leads', 'naturalistic', 'acting', 'tremendous', 'movie', 'subtly', 'big', 'topics', 'such', 'trust', 'masculinity', 'so', 'plethora', 'dialogue', 'more', 'impressive']",The Loneliest Planet
