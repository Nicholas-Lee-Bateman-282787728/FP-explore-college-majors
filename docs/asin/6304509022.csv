Also, the pilot, where the band is hired for a sweet sixteen party (and Davy falls for the birthday girl), could have been included (esp. for the screen tests of the guys at the end of the show).I don't understand why there are three offerings from the second season, which had a lot of hit-and-miss episodes, when most of the first season shows were better.",4,I Would Have Chose Other Episodes,1008720000,"12 19, 2001",2001,861,"['could', 'see', 'why', 'quot', 'Royal', 'Flush', 'quot', 'quot', 'Mijaceogeo', 'quot', 'were', 'included', 'former', 'acknowledged', 'first', 'episode', 'latter', 'last', 'quot', 'Hitting', 'High', 'Seas', 'quot', 'was', 'one', 'least', 'favorite', 'Monkees', 'episodes', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'continue', 'be', 'quot', 'Fairy', 'Tale', 'quot', 'Mike', 'drag', 'bratty', 'princess', 'good.A', 'better', 'episode', 'involving', 'Davy', 'royalty', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'where', 'lookalike', 'prince', 'who', 'too', 'shy', 'talk', 'women', 'Also', 'pilot', 'where', 'band', 'hired', 'sweet', 'sixteen', 'party', 'Davy', 'falls', 'birthday', 'girl', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'esp', 'screen', 'tests', 'guys', 'end', 'show', '.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'are', 'three', 'offerings', 'second', 'season', 'had', 'lot', 'hit-and-miss', 'episodes', 'when', 'most', 'first', 'season', 'shows', 'were', 'better']",The Monkees - Our Favorite Episodes in Metal Lunchbox  VHS

So you get the four episodes (naturally) and bit of reminiscing from each said Monkee (from the late 1990's). The episodes were all filmed in late 1967 (prog 44, 48 & 58), except for Peters filmed in June 1966 (prog 3). My daughter (11) wanted to see some episodes after singing 'I'm a believer' in her school choir and subsequently borrowing my new Monkees CD set - 'The Definitive Monkees limited edition two CD set' (also recommended).My daughter has enjoyed watching this DVD many times, and particularly likes the 'Machine bit with Mike' (in Peter's episode choice). So highly recommended if going cheap. The complete Monkees 1st and 2nd series are now available though on DVD for diehard fans (which must include my daughter as she now has them both as well - and it all started from this DVD title).",5,The Monkees choose their four favourite 'Monkees' episodes,1166832000,"12 23, 2006",2006,1023,"['DVD', 'Monkees', 'Davy', 'Peter', 'Micky', 'Mike', 'pick', 'personal', 'favourite', 'episodes', '60', 'series', ""'Hitting"", 'high', 'seas', 'verses', 'Machine', 'Frodis', 'caper', 'tale', 'respectively', 'get', 'four', 'episodes', 'naturally', 'bit', 'reminiscing', 'said', 'Monkee', 'late', '1990', 'episodes', 'were', 'filmed', 'late', '1967', 'prog', '44', '48', '58', 'Peters', 'filmed', 'June', '1966', 'prog', '3', 'daughter', '11', 'wanted', 'see', 'episodes', 'singing', ""'m"", 'believer', 'school', 'choir', 'subsequently', 'borrowing', 'new', 'Monkees', 'CD', 'set', ""'The"", 'Definitive', 'Monkees', 'limited', 'edition', 'two', 'CD', 'set', 'also', 'recommended', '.My', 'daughter', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'DVD', 'many', 'times', 'particularly', ""'Machine"", 'bit', 'Mike', 'Peter', 'episode', 'choice', 'So', 'highly', 'recommended', 'going', 'cheap', 'complete', 'Monkees', '1st', '2nd', 'series', 'are', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'diehard', 'fans', 'must', 'include', 'daughter', 'now', 'as', 'well', 'all', 'started', 'DVD', 'title']",The Monkees - Our Favorite Episodes in Metal Lunchbox  VHS

I would like to see more of dvds with special shows because the box sets can be rather costly and it was nice to see the favorite shows of the funny four.I was able to see the Monkees on their 20th anniversary tour and if you would have told me when I was young I would have ever seen them in person I would not have believed it. That makes seeing these shows even more precious to my memories because I loved these guys so much I had all their records and as an adult have converted my collection to include all of their cds. I will eventually be able to add more of their dvds to my collections when I can. This is a nice sneak peak into my past loves lives.

The dvd shows the episodes in their entirity with bonus features including commercials featuring the Monkees and interviews with  the band.  Three of the four episodes are excellent, but the Davy Jones  entry (Out to Sea) is a little weak.

427249,A1J5XKY649DQF5,6304509022,smctopia,"[53, 53]","This disc was Rhino's first attempt to package Monkee episodes in the then-new DVD format.  Clips of each of the Monkees from their 1997 documentary are used to introduce their favorite episodes.It has already been noted that the episode that Davy mentions is really &quot;Royal Flush&quot;  (&quot;Hitting the High Seas&quot; is shown instead as his favorite).  &quot;Royal Flush&quot; would have been a better choice because it would've balanced the DVD better to have 2 episodes from the first season and 2 from the second, instead of having 3 from the second and only 1 from the first.The film quality was a bit of a disappointment, especially during parts of &quot;Fairy Tale&quot;.  The quality is much better on Rhino's second Monkee DVD (Monkees Volume 1 &amp; 2) although there are some good moments on this disc.  Some of the episodes have the original end credits with Kellogg's products.  It's fun on both discs to pause the picture and use the &quot;step&quot; button on your DVD remote to discover things that have never been noticed before on VHS copies.The chapter breaks are much better than on Rhino's second Monkee DVD and there are actually breaks for all of the songs in each episode; even the Kellogg's commercial shown during Mijacogeo has a chapter break.Since the DVD format was still young when Rhino released this, it has no extras, not even closed-captioning.  It's too bad that the Monkees couldn't have recorded audio commentary in addition to introducing the episodes.  A photo gallery and some more Kellogg's commercials wouldn't been a nice extra also.Fans desparate for any Monkee episodes on DVD will want to pick this up but keep in mind that the VHS edition is packaged better in a retro-style metal Monkee lunchbox with a mini-ceral box and puzzle.  This DVD will have to do as a &quot;stand in&quot; until Rhino gets around to issuing the entire series on DVD.",4,A Good DVD &quot;Stand In&quot;,1027728000,"07 27, 2002",2002,1899,"['disc', 'was', 'Rhino', 'first', 'attempt', 'package', 'Monkee', 'episodes', 'then-new', 'DVD', 'format', 'Clips', 'Monkees', '1997', 'documentary', 'are', 'used', 'introduce', 'favorite', 'episodes.It', 'already', 'been', 'noted', 'episode', 'Davy', 'mentions', 'really', 'quot', 'Royal', 'Flush', 'quot', 'quot', 'Hitting', 'High', 'Seas', 'quot', 'shown', 'instead', 'favorite', 'quot', 'Royal', 'Flush', 'quot', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'choice', 'would', ""'ve"", 'balanced', 'DVD', 'better', 'have', '2', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', '2', 'second', 'instead', 'having', '3', 'second', 'only', '1', 'first.The', 'film', 'quality', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointment', 'especially', 'parts', 'quot', 'Fairy', 'Tale', 'quot', 'quality', 'much', 'better', 'Rhino', 'second', 'Monkee', 'DVD', 'Monkees', 'Volume', '1', 'amp', '2', 'are', 'good', 'moments', 'disc', 'episodes', 'have', 'original', 'end', 'credits', 'Kellogg', 'products', 'fun', 'discs', 'pause', 'picture', 'use', 'quot', 'step', 'quot', 'button', 'DVD', 'remote', 'discover', 'things', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'noticed', 'VHS', 'copies.The', 'chapter', 'breaks', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'Rhino', 'second', 'Monkee', 'DVD', 'are', 'actually', 'breaks', 'songs', 'episode', 'even', 'Kellogg', 'commercial', 'shown', 'Mijacogeo', 'chapter', 'break.Since', 'DVD', 'format', 'was', 'still', 'young', 'when', 'Rhino', 'released', 'extras', 'not', 'even', 'closed-captioning', 'too', 'bad', 'Monkees', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'recorded', 'audio', 'commentary', 'addition', 'introducing', 'episodes', 'photo', 'gallery', 'more', 'Kellogg', 'commercials', 'would', ""n't"", 'been', 'nice', 'extra', 'also.Fans', 'desparate', 'Monkee', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'will', 'want', 'pick', 'up', 'keep', 'mind', 'VHS', 'edition', 'packaged', 'better', 'retro-style', 'metal', 'Monkee', 'lunchbox', 'mini-ceral', 'box', 'puzzle', 'DVD', 'will', 'have', 'do', 'quot', 'stand', 'quot', 'Rhino', 'around', 'issuing', 'entire', 'series', 'DVD']",The Monkees - Our Favorite Episodes in Metal Lunchbox  VHS
