That's like saying, ""Sure, someone can built a 747 and propose flying people across the ocean, and sure, even though I saw it takeoff myself, I still find no reason to believe that it actually does cross the ocean...it's just a hoax...and I can prove it by showing training videos and photos where it looks like the 747 is missing a wing.""

This film lays bare the coverup and conspiracy that has carried on since the early 60's on our government's faking of the moon landing.

With all the powerful telescopes that we have come up with to date, both Earth and space based, how come no one has ever taken a single photo of the landing site on the moon? We can count the dimples on a golfball from 30 miles up in space with our spy satallite cameras today but we can't take a single photo of the moon landing site to see if what we supposedly left up there is still there and in the location that it is supposed to be? The Hubble telescope can look back into space millions of years and see light from the time of the big bang but none of our satalliets can take a close up shot of the surface of the moon where we supposedly landed and left all kinds of equipment behind?

573533,AGRR05FH945HR,B000059MCU,Steven Cain,"[23, 40]","Having just watched another ""Did we really go to the Moon?"" program, I decided to revisit this review.The main thing that struck me having seen interviews with Doubters and NASA spokespeople is that while the Doubters make very specific observations, which they claim suggest a 'faking' of the Moon landings, the NASA people only make generalized denials.At no time did the principal NASA spokesman take the Doubter's points one by one and answer them directly. Even if you disregard the idea of the Van Allen Belt radiation question, and the flexing or blowing of the flag in a supposed vacuum, a number of points remain problematic.The main area that simply does not look legit is the area under and around the lander - in every single mission. Even given the relatively minimal thrust used during the final descent, there should have been some kind of blast crater, however shallow, under the lander. This, plus the fact that the lander legs were not in any way embedded in the lunar surface, nor was there any dust etc. on the pristine feet, does make the scene look far too neat and tidy. Like a set.The other big concern re: the lander is that during the remotely-viewed take-off, there is no visible thrust from the engine, and in take-off mode, there would have been more thrust than in braking to land. It certainly looks more like the unit has been yanked upwards by a cable, as the Doubters suggest.Equally, the photographs are another problem. Not only does there appear to be more than one light source in many of the photos, as evinced by the shadows falling in different directions, but the clumsy, chest-mounted cameras were such that they could never be aimed with any true precision. Yet somehow all of the lunar photos are beautifully centered, and in crisp focus.I am not even going to examine the suggestion that Gus Grissom was murdered in the launchpad capsule fire, other than to say that Doubters believe he was about to blow the gaff on the Apollo program, and its inability to complete the job by the end of the decade, due to numerous technical inadequacies. They also believe that other individuals were also killed in case they disclosed sensitive information.Did the Apollo team reach the Moon, or was it, as has been suggested, filmed on a set in Area 51? At this point, in the absence of disclosure, we cannot be sure, but the hostile reactions to any reviews which suggest that there may be some truth in the video, raise issues in themselves. Either NASA people are angered by the idea that they have been played for chumps, and that the entire program was just a Cold War political sideshow, or they are all getting their buddies to jump on and click ""No"" because they want to suppress even the idea that anybody has the right to question items that are by ANY definition, anomalies.No, the video does not prove anything definitively, but it does raise many genuinely intelligent questions that NASA have never adequately addressed and which they have refused to take seriously. But then, we all know about the power of Denial, don't we? Governments in all their forms are masters of it.This issue is far too important for NASA to stonewall it. Forty billion dollars of US taxpayer's money went into the Apollo program. Given this outrageous expense, it is morally unacceptable that NASA should just ignore a series of valid questions, which have not been addressed in more than thirty years. Surely NASA could spend a few grand making their own video in order to step-by-step handle every point raised by the Doubters - while having an open two-way discussion with the principal Doubters. That is, if it is possible to deny the claims of those that doubt the legitimacy of the Moon landings, and assuming that NASA has nothing to hide.To merely mumble about 'bad science' and ridicule Doubters and describe people as gullible 'nuts', WITHOUT a systematic examination and disproving of the most disturbing of the apparent anomalies, NASA are just proving what many people suspect - that they are so aloof and contemptuous of the public that paid their wages, they are acting as though they are a law unto themselves.Don't get me wrong, I would LOVE it if NASA would go ahead and effectively disprove the doubts raised by this and other videos. I totally accept that it may be possible for them to do so. Yet in the absence of such a structured analysis, I can only conclude that they are either just too arrogant and contemptuous to feel answerable, or they do indeed have a few skeletons in the closet.",4,This is no time for stonewalling...,1014768000,"02 27, 2002",2002,4539,"['Having', 'just', 'watched', 'Did', 'really', 'go', 'Moon', 'program', 'decided', 'revisit', 'review.The', 'main', 'thing', 'struck', 'having', 'seen', 'interviews', 'Doubters', 'NASA', 'spokespeople', 'Doubters', 'make', 'very', 'specific', 'observations', 'claim', 'suggest', ""'faking"", ""'"", 'Moon', 'landings', 'NASA', 'people', 'only', 'make', 'generalized', 'time', 'did', 'principal', 'NASA', 'spokesman', 'take', 'Doubter', 'points', 'one', 'one', 'answer', 'directly', 'Even', 'disregard', 'idea', 'Van', 'Allen', 'Belt', 'radiation', 'question', 'flexing', 'blowing', 'flag', 'supposed', 'vacuum', 'number', 'points', 'remain', 'problematic.The', 'main', 'area', 'simply', 'not', 'look', 'legit', 'area', 'lander', 'single', 'mission', 'Even', 'given', 'relatively', 'minimal', 'thrust', 'used', 'final', 'descent', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'kind', 'blast', 'crater', 'however', 'shallow', 'lander', 'fact', 'lander', 'legs', 'were', 'not', 'way', 'embedded', 'lunar', 'surface', 'was', 'dust', 'etc', 'pristine', 'feet', 'make', 'scene', 'look', 'far', 'too', 'neat', 'tidy', 'set.The', 'other', 'big', 'concern', 're', 'lander', 'remotely-viewed', 'take-off', 'visible', 'thrust', 'engine', 'take-off', 'mode', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'thrust', 'braking', 'land', 'certainly', 'more', 'unit', 'been', 'yanked', 'upwards', 'cable', 'Doubters', 'suggest.Equally', 'photographs', 'are', 'problem', 'Not', 'only', 'there', 'appear', 'be', 'more', 'one', 'light', 'source', 'many', 'photos', 'evinced', 'shadows', 'falling', 'different', 'directions', 'clumsy', 'chest-mounted', 'cameras', 'were', 'such', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'aimed', 'true', 'precision', 'somehow', 'lunar', 'photos', 'are', 'beautifully', 'centered', 'crisp', 'focus.I', 'am', 'not', 'even', 'going', 'examine', 'suggestion', 'Gus', 'Grissom', 'was', 'murdered', 'launchpad', 'capsule', 'fire', 'other', 'say', 'Doubters', 'believe', 'was', 'about', 'blow', 'gaff', 'Apollo', 'program', 'inability', 'complete', 'job', 'end', 'decade', 'due', 'numerous', 'technical', 'inadequacies', 'also', 'believe', 'other', 'individuals', 'were', 'also', 'killed', 'case', 'disclosed', 'sensitive', 'information.Did', 'Apollo', 'team', 'reach', 'Moon', 'was', 'been', 'suggested', 'filmed', 'set', 'Area', '51', 'point', 'absence', 'disclosure', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'sure', 'hostile', 'reactions', 'reviews', 'suggest', 'may', 'be', 'truth', 'video', 'raise', 'issues', 'NASA', 'people', 'are', 'angered', 'idea', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'chumps', 'entire', 'program', 'was', 'just', 'Cold', 'War', 'political', 'sideshow', 'are', 'getting', 'buddies', 'jump', 'click', 'want', 'suppress', 'even', 'idea', 'anybody', 'right', 'question', 'items', 'are', 'ANY', 'definition', 'anomalies.No', 'video', 'not', 'prove', 'anything', 'definitively', 'raise', 'many', 'genuinely', 'intelligent', 'questions', 'NASA', 'have', 'never', 'adequately', 'addressed', 'have', 'refused', 'take', 'seriously', 'then', 'know', 'power', 'Denial', 'do', ""n't"", 'Governments', 'forms', 'are', 'masters', 'it.This', 'issue', 'far', 'too', 'important', 'NASA', 'stonewall', 'Forty', 'billion', 'dollars', 'US', 'taxpayer', 'money', 'went', 'Apollo', 'program', 'Given', 'outrageous', 'expense', 'morally', 'unacceptable', 'NASA', 'should', 'just', 'ignore', 'series', 'valid', 'questions', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'addressed', 'more', 'thirty', 'years', 'Surely', 'NASA', 'could', 'spend', 'few', 'grand', 'making', 'own', 'video', 'order', 'step-by-step', 'handle', 'point', 'raised', 'Doubters', 'having', 'open', 'two-way', 'discussion', 'principal', 'Doubters', 'possible', 'deny', 'claims', 'doubt', 'legitimacy', 'Moon', 'landings', 'assuming', 'NASA', 'nothing', 'hide.To', 'merely', 'mumble', ""'bad"", 'science', 'ridicule', 'Doubters', 'describe', 'people', 'gullible', ""'nuts"", 'systematic', 'examination', 'disproving', 'most', 'disturbing', 'apparent', 'anomalies', 'NASA', 'are', 'just', 'proving', 'what', 'many', 'people', 'suspect', 'are', 'so', 'aloof', 'contemptuous', 'public', 'paid', 'wages', 'are', 'acting', 'are', 'law', 'unto', 'themselves.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'would', 'LOVE', 'NASA', 'would', 'go', 'ahead', 'effectively', 'disprove', 'doubts', 'raised', 'other', 'videos', 'totally', 'accept', 'may', 'be', 'possible', 'do', 'so', 'absence', 'such', 'structured', 'analysis', 'can', 'only', 'conclude', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'arrogant', 'contemptuous', 'feel', 'answerable', 'do', 'indeed', 'have', 'few', 'skeletons', 'closet']",A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Moon VHS

Obviously in a desperate attempt to make money, Bart W. Sibrel has created this 47-minute documentary, which ranges from unsubstantiated and conjectural at the best to completely ridiculous and downright humorous at the worst.  I laughed my way through most of this, and also through the ludicrous FOX documentary which was broadcast on Thursday, February 15.  After both programs, I told myself that the sensationalist garbage convinced me more than ever that we have landed on the moon during the Apollo program.Sibrel is one of the more amusing conspiracy theorists involved in this issue, and he proves it in this video.  Most of the so-called &quot;evidence&quot; that is put forth as evidence of a faked lunar landing is not new or damning, and can easily be explained by a high school student with a basic physics book.  However, a great deal has been made out of the new video footage which &quot;proves&quot; that Apollo 11, and astronauts Neil Armstrong, Mike Collins, and Buzz Aldrin, never left earth orbit.  Actually, this video is nothing more than footage of Apollo 11's second telecast from space, while on their way to the moon.  Aldrin is moving the camera, and panning back at the earth; if this footage were taken from earth orbit, we would see the clouds and land formations changing.  However, since the earth remains completely still, it is obviously viewing the earth as a globe, and are making their way to the moon in the command module Columbia.  Sibrel, ever the rational thinker, claims that the footage was taken using cardboard to give the impression that they were far away from earth, when they were really only at an altitude of 250 miles, in earth orbit.  This is quite a fantasy, and it could only be concocted by someone with very little real knowledge in spaceflight and the Apollo lunar landings.Thus, I remain convinced, and always will be, that twenty-four Apollo astronauts have indeed sailed the translunar gulf.  Sibrel can keep fooling himself for as long as he pleases, and can continue to try to make money off the gullible and uninformed, but I will always know the truth of this matter.  Do not waste your money on this video, and if you are stupid enough to believe that we never landed on the moon, then get a clue and try something productive.  I would rather read Andrew Chaikin's 700-page book A Man on the Moon, published in 1994, which relates the real story of the lunar landings!",1,Puts the 'dumb' back in 'stupid',989625600,"05 12, 2001",2001,2567,"[""'ve"", 'known', 'long', 'time', 'level', 'scientific', 'expertise', 'nation', 'poor', 'never', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'amptly', 'proven', 'Obviously', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'make', 'money', 'Bart', 'W.', 'Sibrel', 'created', '47-minute', 'documentary', 'unsubstantiated', 'conjectural', 'best', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'downright', 'humorous', 'worst', 'laughed', 'way', 'most', 'also', 'ludicrous', 'FOX', 'documentary', 'was', 'broadcast', 'Thursday', 'February', '15', 'programs', 'told', 'sensationalist', 'garbage', 'convinced', 'more', 'ever', 'have', 'landed', 'moon', 'Apollo', 'program.Sibrel', 'one', 'more', 'amusing', 'conspiracy', 'theorists', 'involved', 'issue', 'video', 'Most', 'so-called', 'quot', 'evidence', 'quot', 'put', 'forth', 'evidence', 'faked', 'lunar', 'landing', 'not', 'new', 'damning', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'explained', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'basic', 'physics', 'book', 'However', 'great', 'deal', 'been', 'made', 'new', 'video', 'footage', 'quot', 'quot', 'Apollo', '11', 'astronauts', 'Neil', 'Armstrong', 'Mike', 'Collins', 'Buzz', 'Aldrin', 'never', 'left', 'earth', 'orbit', 'Actually', 'video', 'nothing', 'more', 'footage', 'Apollo', '11', 'second', 'telecast', 'space', 'way', 'moon', 'Aldrin', 'moving', 'camera', 'panning', 'back', 'earth', 'footage', 'were', 'taken', 'earth', 'orbit', 'would', 'see', 'clouds', 'land', 'formations', 'changing', 'However', 'earth', 'completely', 'still', 'obviously', 'viewing', 'earth', 'globe', 'are', 'making', 'way', 'moon', 'command', 'module', 'Columbia', 'Sibrel', 'ever', 'rational', 'thinker', 'footage', 'was', 'taken', 'using', 'cardboard', 'give', 'impression', 'were', 'far', 'away', 'earth', 'when', 'were', 'really', 'only', 'altitude', '250', 'miles', 'earth', 'orbit', 'quite', 'fantasy', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'concocted', 'someone', 'very', 'little', 'real', 'knowledge', 'spaceflight', 'Apollo', 'lunar', 'landings.Thus', 'remain', 'convinced', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'twenty-four', 'Apollo', 'astronauts', 'have', 'indeed', 'sailed', 'translunar', 'gulf', 'Sibrel', 'can', 'keep', 'fooling', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'continue', 'try', 'make', 'money', 'gullible', 'uninformed', 'will', 'always', 'know', 'truth', 'matter', 'Do', 'not', 'waste', 'money', 'video', 'are', 'stupid', 'enough', 'believe', 'never', 'landed', 'moon', 'then', 'get', 'clue', 'try', 'something', 'productive', 'would', 'rather', 'read', 'Andrew', 'Chaikin', '700-page', 'book', 'A', 'Man', 'Moon', 'published', '1994', 'real', 'story', 'lunar', 'landings']",A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Moon VHS
