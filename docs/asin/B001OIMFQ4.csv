The film is ""It's a Date"", don't be put off by the title ""Rival Sublime"" this is an alternative title given to the film by the DVD producers as this originates from South America. As long as you turn off the subtitles the film is in fact ""It's a Date"". Unless of course you are non English speaking in which case the subtitles are excellent. This film is hard to come by and it is great that this version is available from Amazon. The story is the usual froth that one expects from most of these films but the cast of characters are, as always, extremely likeable and the singing is wonderful. The quality of the film is quite acceptable and if you are a fan of the work of Deanna Durbin you will definitely need to get this DVD.",5,Worth having,1374969600,"07 28, 2013",2013,848,"['DVD', 'add', 'one', 'collection', 'marvellous', 'films', 'late', 'very', 'much', 'missed', 'Deanna', 'Durbin', 'film', 'Date', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'off', 'title', 'Rival', 'Sublime', 'alternative', 'title', 'given', 'film', 'DVD', 'producers', 'South', 'America', 'As', 'long', 'turn', 'off', 'subtitles', 'film', 'fact', 'Date', 'course', 'are', 'non', 'English', 'speaking', 'case', 'subtitles', 'are', 'excellent', 'film', 'hard', 'come', 'great', 'version', 'available', 'Amazon', 'story', 'usual', 'froth', 'one', 'most', 'films', 'cast', 'characters', 'are', 'always', 'extremely', 'likeable', 'singing', 'wonderful', 'quality', 'film', 'quite', 'acceptable', 'are', 'fan', 'work', 'Deanna', 'Durbin', 'will', 'definitely', 'need', 'get', 'DVD']",It's a Date (1940) + Lottery Bride (1930) aka Rival Sublime + Noiva 66 [Import]
