If you are uncertain about purchasing this movie because it is not too well known, let me tell you, it is a GREAT film! For what is basically a low budget film I was very impressed with the production values, acting, and historic authenticity shown in this film. Eonough character development so you cared about the 3 soldiers presented, yet not so much that it sowed the film down at all. Just enough action too. I would say that this is the best WWII movie that I have watched since Saving Private Ryan.

1575334,A32T2H8150OJLU,B008RY5HWW,ARH,"[4, 6]","I watched the first Saints and Soldiers movie a few years back - a low budget movie with a no-name (outside of the Mormon world) cast.  While I wouldn't necessarily say that it was good, it did at least have a storyline that kept things interesting - about 3/5 stars' worth.  It was with that low level of expectations that I decided to watch Saints and Soldiers: Airborne Creed.OK, well, where to start?  The story is basically about three paratroopers, a small handful of French Resistance fighters, and about the same number of Germans.  The set included mainly one shed, one farmhouse, grassy fields, wooded areas, one half-track, and one tank.  Oh, and one jeep, one VW ""Thing"" and one motorcycle + sidecar.The premise seemed somewhat interesting...paratroopers were being dropped into southern France in the aftermath of the DDay invasion that was, BTW, far away from where this story was set.  The three paratroopers meet up after being dropped far from their drop zone, and the main story line seemed to be to try to get to a town where they could meet up with other US paratroopers.I guess the movie was supposed to be character driven, since no plot ever developed, and I would have believed that, except that there was basically little to no character development.  Oh sure, we see one character's flashback to time with his minister-father, and the struggle he had in breaking the news that he had joined an Airborne unit.  Oh, and we got to glimpse another paratrooper and his girlfriend spending time before he shipped out.  And the third paratrooper provided little more than occasional flashbacks of experiences he'd had earlier in the war in Italy.  Flashbacks, but not really any character development.So, maybe this movie was supposed to be plot-driven...except that a central plot never materialized.  There were sporadic exchanges with Germans, a plan to make it to American lines (which never materialized), a diversion to help some French partisans rescue some of their number who were being held prisoner, which didn't really go anywhere, an attack on a half-track and tank that didn't accomplish anything.  Aside from that the main high point was one of the paratroopers NOT telling the others why he got a mohawk haircut.  Oh, there was also a German who played a somewhat foreground role, but all we know is that he has a family with whom he talks on the phone before overseeing the execution of some Frenchmen.  So, what about him?Who are the ""Saints"" in the title?  Was it the German?  Was it the minister's son?  Was it the girlfriend?  I mean, did someone actually proofread and critique the screenplay and review the plot before they went out back and started randomly filming?Upon further reflection all I can say is that this movie is pretty disappointing.2 stars, because something has to be completely terrible and offensive to earn 1.",2,Pros and Cons - mostly cons...watched once...that was enough (Spoiler alert),1365033600,"04 4, 2013",2013,2871,"['watched', 'first', 'Saints', 'Soldiers', 'movie', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'no-name', 'Mormon', 'world', 'cast', 'would', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'say', 'was', 'good', 'did', 'least', 'have', 'storyline', 'kept', 'things', 'interesting', '3/5', 'stars', 'worth', 'was', 'low', 'level', 'expectations', 'decided', 'watch', 'Saints', 'Soldiers', 'Airborne', 'Creed.OK', 'well', 'where', 'start', 'story', 'basically', 'three', 'paratroopers', 'small', 'handful', 'French', 'Resistance', 'fighters', 'same', 'number', 'Germans', 'set', 'included', 'mainly', 'one', 'shed', 'one', 'farmhouse', 'grassy', 'fields', 'wooded', 'areas', 'one', 'half-track', 'one', 'tank', 'Oh', 'one', 'jeep', 'one', 'VW', 'Thing', 'one', 'motorcycle', 'sidecar.The', 'premise', 'seemed', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'paratroopers', 'were', 'being', 'dropped', 'southern', 'France', 'aftermath', 'DDay', 'invasion', 'was', 'BTW', 'far', 'away', 'where', 'story', 'was', 'set', 'three', 'paratroopers', 'meet', 'up', 'being', 'dropped', 'far', 'drop', 'zone', 'main', 'story', 'line', 'seemed', 'be', 'try', 'get', 'town', 'where', 'could', 'meet', 'up', 'other', 'US', 'paratroopers.I', 'guess', 'movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'character', 'driven', 'plot', 'ever', 'developed', 'would', 'have', 'believed', 'was', 'basically', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'Oh', 'sure', 'see', 'one', 'character', 'flashback', 'time', 'minister-father', 'struggle', 'had', 'breaking', 'news', 'had', 'joined', 'Airborne', 'unit', 'Oh', 'got', 'glimpse', 'paratrooper', 'girlfriend', 'spending', 'time', 'shipped', 'out', 'third', 'paratrooper', 'provided', 'little', 'more', 'occasional', 'flashbacks', 'experiences', ""'d"", 'had', 'earlier', 'war', 'Italy', 'Flashbacks', 'not', 'really', 'character', 'development.So', 'maybe', 'movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'plot-driven', 'central', 'plot', 'never', 'materialized', 'were', 'sporadic', 'exchanges', 'Germans', 'plan', 'make', 'American', 'lines', 'never', 'materialized', 'diversion', 'help', 'French', 'partisans', 'rescue', 'number', 'who', 'were', 'being', 'held', 'prisoner', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'anywhere', 'attack', 'half-track', 'tank', 'did', ""n't"", 'accomplish', 'anything', 'Aside', 'main', 'high', 'point', 'was', 'one', 'paratroopers', 'NOT', 'telling', 'others', 'why', 'got', 'mohawk', 'haircut', 'Oh', 'was', 'also', 'German', 'who', 'played', 'somewhat', 'foreground', 'role', 'know', 'family', 'whom', 'phone', 'overseeing', 'execution', 'Frenchmen', 'So', 'what', 'Who', 'are', 'Saints', 'title', 'Was', 'German', 'Was', 'minister', 'son', 'Was', 'girlfriend', 'mean', 'did', 'someone', 'actually', 'proofread', 'screenplay', 'review', 'plot', 'went', 'out', 'back', 'started', 'randomly', 'filming', 'further', 'reflection', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'pretty', 'disappointing.2', 'stars', 'something', 'be', 'completely', 'terrible', 'offensive', 'earn', '1']",N/A
