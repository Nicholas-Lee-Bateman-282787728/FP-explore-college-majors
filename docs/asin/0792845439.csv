Pompous, ridiculous, self important dialogue that goes on and on and makes no sense. Phony, insincere performances that make the phrase ""stilted"" a compliment. Everyone is painfully miscast. I suspect that participation in this flick by cast and crew was obtained because everybody got a neat, free trip to the beautiful Phillipines, although that being said, the cinematography is weak and doesn't do it justice.The worst stuff is the ""erotic' material, i.e., a couple of pg-rated sex scenes, including a three way between the two men and Sheryl Lee (the prime reason my husband rented it I guess), which was so awkward that it performs the odd, moraliistic job of making kinky sex look BORING. And the actors look painfully embarassed all during. I felt sorry for them.

The story is quickly told: Jeff and Marty leave their families behind to go on a trip to a beautiful island where they fall in love with the same woman who is played by the amazingly sexy Sheryl Lee. Although &quot;Kiss The Sky&quot; goes on for too long it's never really hard to watch since there are beautiful locations and a nice supporting cast which includes Terence Stamp (&quot;Bliss&quot;), Patricia Charbonneau (&quot;CallMe&quot;) and Season Hubley (&quot;Hardcore&quot;). The three leading actors are great, too - although I wasn't completely convinced by Peterson's performance (but maybe that's my fault since I just know him as a tough cop in &quot;Manhunter&quot; and &quot;To Live and Die in L.A.&quot;).Another positive aspect of &quot;Kiss The Sky&quot; is the nice soundtrack by Leonard Cohen (I especially like &quot;Dance Me To The End Of Love&quot;).Not everyone's taste, but if you like the actors you might also like &quot;Kiss The Sky",4,"Sometimes deep, sometimes boring but always easy to watch...",997920000,"08 16, 2001",2001,1046,"['movie', 'two', 'yuppies', 'Cole', 'Peterson', 'searching', 'sense', 'life', 'story', 'quickly', 'told', 'Jeff', 'Marty', 'leave', 'families', 'go', 'trip', 'beautiful', 'island', 'where', 'fall', 'love', 'same', 'woman', 'who', 'played', 'amazingly', 'sexy', 'Sheryl', 'Lee', 'quot', 'Kiss', 'Sky', 'quot', 'too', 'long', 'never', 'really', 'hard', 'watch', 'are', 'beautiful', 'locations', 'nice', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'quot', 'Bliss', 'quot', 'Patricia', 'Charbonneau', 'quot', 'CallMe', 'quot', 'Season', 'Hubley', 'quot', 'Hardcore', 'quot', 'three', 'leading', 'actors', 'are', 'great', 'too', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'convinced', 'Peterson', 'performance', 'maybe', 'fault', 'just', 'know', 'tough', 'cop', 'quot', 'Manhunter', 'quot', 'quot', 'Live', 'Die', 'L.A.', 'quot', '.Another', 'positive', 'aspect', 'quot', 'Kiss', 'Sky', 'quot', 'nice', 'soundtrack', 'Leonard', 'Cohen', 'especially', 'quot', 'Dance', 'Me', 'End', 'Love', 'quot', '.Not', 'everyone', 'taste', 'like', 'actors', 'might', 'also', 'like', 'quot', 'Kiss', 'Sky']",N/A

Petersen's character here is a variation on his CSI persona --- cerebral, but more of a searcher, more plagued by doubt, more Eastern in his thinking, and more sexual.I disliked ""American Beauty"" -- I found it to be a grossly insincere and overly simplistic parody of its subject matter.  This film, however, even in spite of its (several) miscues, left me wanting to know more about the characters and their lives.  It resonates with much more complex dialogue and thought-processes behind the writing.A worthy alternative (and to my mind, a much better alternative) to American Beauty ---- but with more explicit sex themes and scenes.",4,"Three and a half stars --- Flawed, but",1012262400,"01 29, 2002",2002,781,"['Flawed', 'much', 'better', 'American', 'Beauty', 'interesting', 'meditation', 'suburban', 'affluent', 'male', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'search', 'meaning', 'Petersen', 'character', 'here', 'variation', 'CSI', 'persona', 'cerebral', 'more', 'searcher', 'more', 'plagued', 'doubt', 'more', 'Eastern', 'thinking', 'more', 'sexual.I', 'disliked', 'American', 'Beauty', 'found', 'be', 'grossly', 'insincere', 'overly', 'simplistic', 'parody', 'subject', 'matter', 'film', 'however', 'even', 'spite', 'several', 'miscues', 'left', 'wanting', 'know', 'more', 'characters', 'lives', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'dialogue', 'thought-processes', 'writing.A', 'worthy', 'alternative', 'mind', 'much', 'better', 'alternative', 'American', 'Beauty', 'more', 'explicit', 'sex', 'themes', 'scenes']",N/A

I guess that if you are self-satisfied, then you probably won't like this movie.  But being who I am and where I have been in my life, it touched me deeply, particularly with its mournful Leonard Cohen songs in the background and its sad twist at the end.  I strongly disagree with the reviewer who thought the presence of Terence Stamp's Buddhist monk and the story line of the building of the tower were extraneous.  I see this story as the two main characters' search for an earthly nirvana, and the tower is a literal construction evoking the movie's title.  I bought this movie because I am a big fan of Billy Petersen, and he gives really fine performance here, worth an extra star.

As a man, I think the movie has profound dialogue, compelling characters, and a deep message.  She finds the movie painful and disturbing.  The difference in our reactions to the movie is an indication to whom the movie is targeted.In Daniel Levinson's classic book ""Seasons of a Man's Life"" he describes the emotional turmoil most men experience during key transitions in their lives. It is no secret the mid-life crisis is one of them, though Levinson has a different name for the period. Kiss the Sky captures the mid-life crisis beautifully.  Longing for the time-purified memories of the past, dissatisfaction with the stresses and relationships of the present, and absolute dread of the foreseeable future if the current circumstances continue unchanged summarize the period in a man's life.  Men in crisis also want their life's effort to have meaning and purpose.  When men realize their life is probably more than half over, crisis ensues.The movie captures the mid-life crisis turmoil beautifully in the two main characters, though each approaches the period from a different perspective and intellectual capacity.  William Petersen's character appears deep, thoughtful, and confident; Gary Cole's character more superficial, obvious, and insecure.  Both are wearing masks though, a theme that opens the movie, appears again mid-way through, and finally in the end the true nature of each is revealed.Terence Stamp's character, Kozen the Buddhist monk, has been characterized here and elsewhere as unnecessary. He is actually key to demonstrating the misguided efforts the men are using to resolve their conflicts.  As a willing participant in their project, someone who has given up all worldly attachments and relationships, he is the contrast that clearly indicates there is no one path to happiness out of the mid-life period.Sheryl Lee as Andy is a pure joy to watch.  She is a present-day reflection of the relationships the men experienced in the past.  Without the passage of time to purify the memories, she proves to the men that no relationship is easy or effortless.Many of the messages in the movie are missed on just the first viewing because there is often so much wisdom in every line, especially the first half of the movie.  Subsequent views allow the viewer to catch the messages and reflect on them in one's own life.William Petersen's last lines in the movie are a perfect summation of the way to resolve one's own mid-life crisis, but like him the journey to get there is an essential part of the resolution.",5,A movie for men age 40+ and the mid-life crisis,1354838400,"12 7, 2012",2012,2680,"['wife', 'share', 'interest', 'probably', '80', '%', 'movies', 'own', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Kiss', 'Sky', 'when', 'slip', 'disc', 'player', 'man', 'think', 'movie', 'profound', 'dialogue', 'compelling', 'characters', 'deep', 'message', 'movie', 'painful', 'disturbing', 'difference', 'reactions', 'movie', 'indication', 'whom', 'movie', 'targeted.In', 'Daniel', 'Levinson', 'classic', 'book', 'Seasons', 'Man', 'Life', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'most', 'men', 'experience', 'key', 'transitions', 'lives', 'secret', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'one', 'Levinson', 'different', 'name', 'period', 'Kiss', 'Sky', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'beautifully', 'Longing', 'time-purified', 'memories', 'past', 'dissatisfaction', 'stresses', 'relationships', 'present', 'absolute', 'dread', 'foreseeable', 'future', 'current', 'circumstances', 'continue', 'unchanged', 'summarize', 'period', 'man', 'life', 'Men', 'crisis', 'also', 'want', 'life', 'effort', 'have', 'meaning', 'purpose', 'When', 'men', 'realize', 'life', 'probably', 'more', 'half', 'crisis', 'ensues.The', 'movie', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'turmoil', 'beautifully', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'period', 'different', 'perspective', 'intellectual', 'capacity', 'William', 'Petersen', 'character', 'deep', 'thoughtful', 'confident', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'character', 'more', 'superficial', 'obvious', 'insecure', 'are', 'wearing', 'masks', 'theme', 'movie', 'again', 'mid-way', 'finally', 'end', 'true', 'nature', 'revealed.Terence', 'Stamp', 'character', 'Kozen', 'Buddhist', 'monk', 'been', 'characterized', 'here', 'elsewhere', 'unnecessary', 'actually', 'key', 'demonstrating', 'misguided', 'efforts', 'men', 'are', 'using', 'resolve', 'conflicts', 'willing', 'participant', 'project', 'someone', 'who', 'given', 'up', 'worldly', 'attachments', 'relationships', 'contrast', 'clearly', 'one', 'path', 'happiness', 'mid-life', 'period.Sheryl', 'Lee', 'Andy', 'pure', 'joy', 'watch', 'present-day', 'reflection', 'relationships', 'men', 'experienced', 'past', 'passage', 'time', 'purify', 'memories', 'men', 'relationship', 'easy', 'effortless.Many', 'messages', 'movie', 'are', 'missed', 'just', 'first', 'viewing', 'often', 'so', 'much', 'wisdom', 'line', 'especially', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'Subsequent', 'views', 'allow', 'viewer', 'catch', 'messages', 'reflect', 'one', 'own', 'life.William', 'Petersen', 'last', 'lines', 'movie', 'are', 'perfect', 'summation', 'way', 'resolve', 'one', 'own', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'journey', 'get', 'essential', 'part', 'resolution']",N/A
