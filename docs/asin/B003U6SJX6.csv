He's so obsessed with the creatures that he has a giant worm farm in his basement solely for experimental purposes. Some of the experiments he intends to perform include inflicting worms to extreme conditions of hot and cold. However, Todd doesn't discover until later that some of the worms in his farm don't like what they've been overhearing and they set out to teach Todd a lesson.""Bad Hare Day"" - Tim is obsessed with magic. He dreams of performing amazing feats of illusion on stage. Unfortunately, Tim's friends have seen all his tricks and if Tim is going to get any better he needs some new tricks. The owner of the magic store gives Tim two tickets to see a performance of the spectacular ""Amaz-O"" who is performing in town that night. When he sneaks out of the house, he's caught by his younger sister who he agrees to bring along. When Amaz-O calls for a volunteer, Tim is chosen and as a result he ends up missing most of the magic show. When he goes to see Amaz-O in his dressing room, he's told to scram. In retaliation he steals Amaz-O's magic kit. But, the kit really is magical and causes all sorts of problems for Tim.""Revenge of the Lawn Gnomes"" - Joe's father purchases two large lawn gnomes to decorate their lavish backyard garden. It's all part of an attempt to win a community garden award. Joe's next door neighbor is a crusty military man named Major McCall. The Major is determined to win the garden prize and believes Joe is bent on sabotaging his garden. Joe has no such intention, but apparently the lawn gnomes do as Joe watches them come to life one night and sneak over into Major McCall's yard.Like the books that most of the episodes are based upon, there are some good ""Goosebumps"", there are some bad ""Goosebumps"", and there are some that are just so-so. All three of the episodes on GO EAT WORMS are just so-so ""Goosebumps"" episodes. None of them are terrible, but none of them are all that memorable either. Fans of the ""Goosebumps"" series (both the books and the show) will probably enjoy this DVD most.",3,"Intelligent Worms, a Magic Rabbit, and Evil Gnomes",1327536000,"01 26, 2012",2012,2213,"['GO', 'EAT', 'WORMS', 'collection', 'three', 'episodes', 'mid-1990s', 'children', 'tv', 'show', 'Go', 'Eat', 'Worms', 'Todd', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'unhealthy', 'fascination', 'worms', 'so', 'obsessed', 'creatures', 'giant', 'worm', 'farm', 'basement', 'solely', 'experimental', 'purposes', 'experiments', 'perform', 'include', 'inflicting', 'worms', 'extreme', 'conditions', 'hot', 'cold', 'However', 'Todd', ""n't"", 'discover', 'later', 'worms', 'farm', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'overhearing', 'set', 'out', 'teach', 'Todd', 'lesson', 'Bad', 'Hare', 'Day', 'Tim', 'obsessed', 'magic', 'performing', 'amazing', 'feats', 'illusion', 'stage', 'Unfortunately', 'Tim', 'friends', 'have', 'seen', 'tricks', 'Tim', 'going', 'get', 'better', 'new', 'tricks', 'owner', 'magic', 'store', 'Tim', 'two', 'tickets', 'see', 'performance', 'spectacular', 'Amaz-O', 'who', 'performing', 'town', 'night', 'When', 'house', 'caught', 'younger', 'sister', 'who', 'bring', 'along', 'When', 'Amaz-O', 'volunteer', 'Tim', 'chosen', 'result', 'up', 'missing', 'most', 'magic', 'show', 'When', 'see', 'Amaz-O', 'dressing', 'room', 'told', 'scram', 'retaliation', 'Amaz-O', 'magic', 'kit', 'kit', 'really', 'magical', 'sorts', 'problems', 'Tim', 'Revenge', 'Lawn', 'Gnomes', 'Joe', 'father', 'purchases', 'two', 'large', 'lawn', 'gnomes', 'decorate', 'lavish', 'backyard', 'garden', 'part', 'attempt', 'win', 'community', 'garden', 'award', 'Joe', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'crusty', 'military', 'man', 'named', 'Major', 'McCall', 'Major', 'determined', 'win', 'garden', 'prize', 'Joe', 'bent', 'sabotaging', 'garden', 'Joe', 'such', 'intention', 'apparently', 'lawn', 'gnomes', 'do', 'Joe', 'come', 'life', 'one', 'night', 'sneak', 'Major', 'McCall', 'yard.Like', 'books', 'most', 'episodes', 'are', 'based', 'are', 'good', 'Goosebumps', 'are', 'bad', 'Goosebumps', 'are', 'are', 'just', 'so-so', 'three', 'episodes', 'GO', 'EAT', 'WORMS', 'are', 'just', 'so-so', 'Goosebumps', 'episodes', 'None', 'are', 'terrible', 'none', 'are', 'memorable', 'Fans', 'Goosebumps', 'series', 'books', 'show', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'most']",N/A
