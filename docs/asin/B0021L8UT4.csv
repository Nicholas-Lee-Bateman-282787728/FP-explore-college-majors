Known for his music savvy, Will is approached by Charlotte (Alyson Michalka), a popular student who hopes to tap his astuteness for her bandslam entry.A tongue-in-cheek critique of the state of music, as well as the close-minded cliques that preserve it, Bandslam is a refreshing surprise filled with sardonic jabs and stirring family secrets",3,Not anything great...,1275004800,"05 28, 2010",2010,819,"['Starting', 'high', 'school', 'rock', 'band', 'nowadays', 'as', 'easy', 'plugging', 'plastic', 'instruments', 'video', 'game', 'console', 'following', 'progression', 'blinking', 'lights.And', 'most', 'teens', 'are', 'comfortable', 'pantomiming', 'prowess', 'virtual', 'world', 'others', 'ones', 'movie', 'are', 'intent', 'rockin', 'out', 'old', 'school.Upon', 'moving', 'new', 'town', 'music', 'aficionado', 'Will', 'Gaelan', 'Connell', 'jaded', 'Sa5m', 'Vanessa', 'Hudgens', 'who', 'school', 'bandslam', 'competition', 'Known', 'music', 'savvy', 'Will', 'approached', 'Charlotte', 'Alyson', 'Michalka', 'popular', 'student', 'who', 'tap', 'astuteness', 'bandslam', 'entry.A', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'critique', 'state', 'music', 'as', 'well', 'close-minded', 'cliques', 'preserve', 'Bandslam', 'refreshing', 'surprise', 'filled', 'sardonic', 'jabs', 'stirring', 'family', 'secrets']",Bandslam

1247057,AVT9Q9PTUCDMR,B0021L8UT4,Brian Maitland,"[1, 1]","High school dramas often get slagged for being full of stereotyped situations and characters. The funny thing is they really aren't stereotypes. They are complete misses.This movie nails the whole high school experience in a much more realistic way by focusing on a group of kids who have a shared love of music (and when I say music, I'm talking kids who have such eclectic tastes as the Velvet Underground, Cheap Trick, the Pistols right up to the Killers). Throw in the idea of casting actors who can actually play their instruments and sing and this movie is one underrated winner.Now those of you who might figure having High School Musical's Vanessa Hudgens in it would be a recipe for disaster. Give her a shot as she plays totally against her Disney character in that film to play an intelligent, cool, unaffected bookworm who loves the movie Evil Dead 2 (hey, the scriptwriters know their stuff as anyone with a brain knows how much the sequel ups the ante from the first one).Throw in another Disney star Aly Michalka as not only another total hottie but one who rocks (check out her singing ""Amphetamine""--guaranteed to blow you away) and this is a movie that defies stereotypes.The star of the movie though is lead actor Gaelen Connell who plays the teenage loner not by choice but by pure bad luck who blossoms once his love of music is channeled into the right people.All the bit players are classic, too, from the cello to piano player, to the daycare kids to mom Lisa Kudrow.The extras are decent with some cool deleted scenes that get the director's commentary, too, as well as a couple of music videos tossed on.Look, any movie that pays homage to the famous NYC punk dive CBGB (not it's not CBGB's actually, trivia fans) and does it right gets my vote.A very underrated gem of both the high school flick genre and music genre.",5,"captures exactly what it was like discovering ""real"" music",1314144000,"08 24, 2011",2011,1845,"['High', 'school', 'dramas', 'often', 'get', 'slagged', 'being', 'full', 'stereotyped', 'situations', 'characters', 'funny', 'thing', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'stereotypes', 'are', 'complete', 'misses.This', 'movie', 'whole', 'high', 'school', 'experience', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'way', 'focusing', 'group', 'kids', 'who', 'have', 'shared', 'love', 'music', 'when', 'say', 'music', ""'m"", 'talking', 'kids', 'who', 'have', 'such', 'eclectic', 'tastes', 'Velvet', 'Underground', 'Cheap', 'Trick', 'Pistols', 'right', 'up', 'Killers', 'Throw', 'idea', 'casting', 'actors', 'who', 'can', 'actually', 'play', 'instruments', 'sing', 'movie', 'one', 'underrated', 'winner.Now', 'who', 'might', 'figure', 'having', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'Vanessa', 'Hudgens', 'would', 'be', 'recipe', 'disaster', 'Give', 'shot', 'totally', 'Disney', 'character', 'film', 'play', 'intelligent', 'cool', 'unaffected', 'bookworm', 'who', 'movie', 'Evil', 'Dead', '2', 'hey', 'scriptwriters', 'know', 'stuff', 'anyone', 'brain', 'how', 'much', 'sequel', 'ante', 'first', 'one', '.Throw', 'Disney', 'star', 'Aly', 'Michalka', 'not', 'only', 'total', 'hottie', 'one', 'who', 'check', 'out', 'singing', 'Amphetamine', 'guaranteed', 'blow', 'away', 'movie', 'stereotypes.The', 'star', 'movie', 'though', 'lead', 'actor', 'Gaelen', 'Connell', 'who', 'teenage', 'loner', 'not', 'choice', 'pure', 'bad', 'luck', 'who', 'once', 'love', 'music', 'channeled', 'right', 'people.All', 'bit', 'players', 'are', 'classic', 'too', 'cello', 'piano', 'player', 'daycare', 'kids', 'mom', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow.The', 'extras', 'are', 'decent', 'cool', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'get', 'director', 'commentary', 'too', 'as', 'well', 'couple', 'music', 'videos', 'tossed', 'on.Look', 'movie', 'homage', 'famous', 'NYC', 'punk', 'dive', 'CBGB', 'not', 'not', 'CBGB', 'actually', 'trivia', 'fans', 'right', 'vote.A', 'very', 'underrated', 'gem', 'high', 'school', 'flick', 'genre', 'music', 'genre']",Bandslam

No raunchy stuff and no toilet talk by oversexed teens.  It's a quality teen movie for a change, rather than the tripe that Hollywood often puts out.

1247064,A27OBJA1YDQFZI,B0021L8UT4,"E. M. Bristol ""bibliophile""","[3, 4]","When Will (Gaelan Connell)'s mom gets a new job, he has a chance to change high schools and reinvent himself.  In movie tradition, he meets both a feisty brunette and a hot blonde, and gets to spend a lot of time hanging out with them.  The brunette loves to read and has a pretty good voice; the blonde recruits Will to manage their band (her boyfriend's got a band, too) so they'll be ready for a competition called Bandslam.  The brunette (Vanessa Hudgkins) turns out to be vulnerable beneath her tough exterior.  The blonde is a former cheerleader with her own Wikipedia page, and Will can't quite believe she likes him.  You can probably tell where this is all going, but it's a sweet movie and manages to feel fresh despite the clich&eacute;s.Here the parents of the teens are either completely absent or always in the same room.  Lisa Kudrow plays Will's helicopter mom, who we always see hovering over her son, including in the bathroom while he showers.  Unlike so many movies where the kid's parent shows up at the last minute to watch his performance in the Big Show, she's right there the whole time selling t-shirts and cheering.Frankly, I liked ""School of Rock,"" in which Jack Black plays a substitute teacher who organizes a multicultural group of kids to compete in a rock concert better.  The musicians seemed to be having a lot more fun performing.  You could believe, for once, that it was their love of music, and not just a desire to win, that was driving them.  Also, even if the ""SOR"" characters' were stereotypical, most of them at least got a storyline.  Here it's just Will's character and the two love interests.'

1247065,A271KAH1SN42C8,B0021L8UT4,G. Todd Jr.,"[6, 6]","The decision to rent Bandslam this week for a family movie night was based purely on the strength of my awareness of very good reviews last year in the face of Summit Entertainment's marketing controversy.  My wife and I have four kids ranging from 14 to 9 so we try to cover a lot of bases on our movie nights.The real story here is not that the movie is good (it is), but that the marketing is now famously referred to as possibly the worst for any film in recent memory.  To wit:  here is a movie that would appeal to a typical John Hughes audience (e.g. Farris Bueller's Day Off, etc.), which fell victim to such poor promotion -- from the trailers to the poster and even the title (changed by the studio against the director's wishes) -- that no one ever got close to the theater door.  Worse, when looking to rent it we found it located in the Blockbuster store in the ""Just for Kids"" section between a kiddie cartoon movie and the new Barbie cgi release.Bandslam is funny, poignant and edgy enough to appeal to everyone in the family, yet, sadly, the marketing campaign spun this film toward a pre-teen High School Musical audience which by release date was as fashionable as highway roadkill.  The film was pulled from theaters before the ink was dry on the posters.The final verdict:  our kids want to buy both the DVD as well as the very good soundtrack which features the likes of Wilco, Bowie, the Velvet Underground, and Nick Drake -- and my wife and I will happily oblige!",4,"Similar to a good John Hughes movie, but a marketing travesty",1276646400,"06 16, 2010",2010,1486,"['decision', 'rent', 'Bandslam', 'week', 'family', 'movie', 'night', 'was', 'based', 'purely', 'strength', 'awareness', 'very', 'good', 'reviews', 'last', 'year', 'face', 'Summit', 'Entertainment', 'marketing', 'controversy', 'wife', 'have', 'four', 'kids', 'ranging', '14', '9', 'try', 'cover', 'lot', 'bases', 'movie', 'nights.The', 'real', 'story', 'here', 'not', 'movie', 'good', 'marketing', 'now', 'famously', 'referred', 'possibly', 'worst', 'film', 'recent', 'memory', 'wit', 'here', 'movie', 'would', 'appeal', 'typical', 'John', 'Hughes', 'audience', 'e.g', 'Farris', 'Bueller', 'Day', 'Off', 'etc', 'fell', 'victim', 'such', 'poor', 'promotion', 'trailers', 'poster', 'even', 'title', 'changed', 'studio', 'director', 'wishes', 'one', 'ever', 'got', 'close', 'theater', 'door', 'Worse', 'when', 'looking', 'rent', 'found', 'located', 'Blockbuster', 'store', 'Just', 'Kids', 'section', 'kiddie', 'cartoon', 'movie', 'new', 'Barbie', 'cgi', 'release.Bandslam', 'funny', 'poignant', 'edgy', 'enough', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'family', 'yet', 'sadly', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'spun', 'film', 'pre-teen', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'audience', 'release', 'date', 'was', 'as', 'fashionable', 'highway', 'roadkill', 'film', 'was', 'pulled', 'theaters', 'ink', 'was', 'dry', 'posters.The', 'final', 'verdict', 'kids', 'want', 'buy', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'likes', 'Wilco', 'Bowie', 'Velvet', 'Underground', 'Nick', 'Drake', 'wife', 'will', 'happily', 'oblige']",Bandslam

However it is witty, fun, inspiring and somewhat original. Will, a nerdy teen, moves to a new community. He starts to fit in due to a love for music. He begins managing a band and puts it into a band competition. For the most part the movie avoids boring cliches (for example Will doesn't end up joining the band and receiving the accolades). He instead overcomes his unpopularity by using it against those harrassing him. This movie has almost NO bad language. It is appropriate for children (mine loved it) but also great for Adults.

1247067,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0021L8UT4,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[22, 22]","Take a chance on this unexpected gem, do, and never mind that you may have gone ""Uh oh!"" when you first noticed Vanessa Hudgens's name on the billing (although, okay, I did sneakily like the first HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL). I walked into BANDSLAM unawares, didn't really know what it was about, and I ended up pleased and tremendously entertained. I guess that's when the taste is sweetest, when you're not expecting too much. BANDSLAM has more in common with NICK & NORAH'S INFINITE PLAYLIST than it does with HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL.Gaelan Connell, I haven't seen him before, but he seems a natural at playing the nervous, ill-fitting-in, fumbly role and, somewhere, a threatened Michael Cera has to be biting his fingernails. This kid is also glib enough that he even reminds me of vintage young John Cusack. Connell plays iPod-attached misfit Will Burton who is newly moved to Lodi, New Jersey, and he's actually glad to be in the Garden State, so you get an idea of how miserable his past existence must have been. He now attends Van Buren High School, where he learns that the biggest event is the Bandslam, this annual Tri-State Battle of the Bands (winner gets a record deal).Will loves Indie rock; he regularly writes to David Bowie in this thoroughly one-way correspondence relationship. Will also happens to be a walking encyclopedia of rock & roll knowledge, and this may or may not have something to do with his being befriended by the very cool and popular ex-cheerleader Charlotte (Aly Michalka, of the pop duo Aly & AJ). Charlotte fronts a lowly garage band, and she dreams of competing on Bandslam, although her band would have to contend with her school's own juggernaut rock group, Ben Wheatly & the Glory Dogs (Ben Wheatly, by the way, is Charlotte's ex). Will, thru no fault of his own, becomes the manager of Charlotte's tiny band. Juuuust a bit out of his depth, he's got eight weeks to get good at this gig before the big Battle of the Bands swings around. For Will Burton, it's time to come out of his shell.Will also meets Sa5m (Hudgens, branching out from sweetness and light). Sa5m - the ""5"" is silent - is quirky and brooding and talks a bit like MTV's Daria. Sa5m also has a secret. She and Will become partners in a classroom project, and one of my four best moments in the movie has to do with Will's part of the project. The other three moments? They're all musical numbers and performed by Will and Charlotte's band.BANDSLAM is a coming-of-age movie and it isn't vanilla or moronic, and you could've knocked me over with a feather when I later realized this was a PG-rated film. But, yeah, looking back, I don't remember any profanity. Or gross-out content or mean-spiritedness for its own sake. Instead there's an emotional weight, a passion for music and an edginess and tons of smart screenplay. There's even possibly the most awkward first kiss in history. There isn't a bad performance, only varying shades of very good and terrific. It helps that there's a complexity to the characters. Gaelan Connell, endlessly relatable, easily carries the film. Aly Michalka comes in and blows me away, and I love that there are different sides to her unpredictable character, and a bite. And she has pipes, stronger than Vanessa Hudgens'. It's hard not to rock out to her rendition of Steve Wynn's ""Amphetamine."" Meanwhile, Vanessa Hudgens steps a bit out of her comfort zone, and I liked it. I didn't think Hudgens and emo would work, and yet it does.And Lisa Kudrow is Lisa Kudrow, and that's always a good thing for the movie audience.It wouldn't have worked so well if the music hadn't been so great. The actors sing the songs and play the instruments, and is it me or does that bass player remind you of a young Stephen King? I love that the little garage band develops its own sound, and ""I Can't Go On, I'll Go On"" is an absolutely inspired name for a rock band. Cameron Crowe will probably appreciate ""I Can't Go On, I'll Go On."" John Hughes probably would have liked this movie.

1247076,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0021L8UT4,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","There are great movies out there that become classics. There are movies out there that stink to high Heaven. There are art films that most people just don't get. And then there are movies that are nothing more than a load of fun. Such is the case with BANDSLAM.BANDSLAM tells the tale of Will Burton (Gaelan Connell), a withdrawn teen in Cincinnati who can't stand his high school. Not part of any crowd he's pleased as can be when his mom (Lisa Kudrow) decides to quit her job and move the two of them to New Jersey where her sister has found her new work.Will's love of music should make him a shoe in with the new kids but alas, such is not the case. Instead he discovers that the same cliques roam the halls of the new school just like the old. With one exception. Rather than high school sports being the main event, this school is pumped up for something called Bandslam.At lunch one day a student takes the stage and introduces the local heroes, a band called Ben Wheatley and the Glory Dogs. As they begin to play, Will looks towards the stage and notices a girl sitting at his table named Sa5m (the 5 is silent) played by Vanessa Hudgens. When he asks her how big this Bandslam is here she tells him ""as big as Texas football"".In class, Will and Sa5m are partnered up in an exercise the teacher has put together where two students get to know each other and then tell the rest of the class who that other person is. They can use everything from visual aids like slides or film to poetry. These two different individuals don't start well but eventually grow on one another.At the same time Will catches the eye of Charlotte (Alyson Michalka). She snags Will into helping her sit the kids in a pre-schoolers class and then hooks his Ipod into the sound system. When Will tells her that his dad is a side musician who played with The Who, she invites him to hear her band at practice.Will accepts, attracted to Charlotte who he obviously has no chance with. After hearing the band he tells them his opinions of how they sound and act. Hoping to improve themselves with Will's help in an attempt to take out the Glory Dogs (of which these were the original members till Ben kicked them all out), they follow his suggestions and add to the group. With a little work and perseverance, they begin to look like they have a chance to be the second band representing their high school at Bandslam.Along the way Will and Charlotte become close friends. But Sa5m has warned Will from the start, girls like her are just trouble. While their friendship grows, Will and Sa5m become close as well, more along the couple type line.A few mistakes in how to deal with friends, girlfriends, moms and more round out the story. Toss in Charlotte's being Ben's ex girlfriend that he wants to get back with and you have the makings for teen angst in a nutshell. Will Charlotte stay with the band? What is Charlotte's big secret? Will Will unite this rag tag group into a band? Will the band discover Will's misrepresentation of himself? And what about Will and Sa5m?  All is answered before the final moments of the film.What makes this movie fun is the joy of music that is observed by all. While these kids talk a good talk about loving independent music like the early Ramones, etc., their sound doesn't come close to resembling it. But it doesn't matter. They have a youthful enthusiasm and it shows. And actually a ska rendition of the classic Bread song ""Everything I Own"" turns out to be pretty good.Most people will toss this movie into the category of the HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL films. But it seemed to me to be less Disney and more John Hughes, kind of a combination of the two. The film does call for a healthy dose of suspension of belief, but it doesn't matter. Why? Because it's fun!I've always thought that movies should be entertaining before anything else. This film offers that. Will it be one that folks will reference when talking about cinema? No way. Will it be one that people will remember forever? Nope. Will it offer a nice easy evening of entertainment? Definitely.A decent (though unbelievable) story, a good looking cast, pretty good acting and some fairly good music make this a movie you can enjoy and the kids can watch as well.

It's painfully routed in fantasy, a trend most adolescent movies tend to follow, but with interesting characters and a hip soundtrack, the target audience is likely to be thoroughly entertained. Formulaic at times but unpredictable at others, Bandslam isn't as unique as it is well-timed. Amidst the really sour teen flicks popping up in theaters, this is less immature, more comedic and generally more fun.Will Burton (Gaelan Connell) trudges through high school life in Cincinnati at a school he describes as Guantanamo with a lunch period. It's Novocain for the soul, providing him a constant source of boredom and bullying. His mother Karen (Lisa Kudrow) brings him great news that they're going to move to New Jersey, and although he feels that his classmates will provide much of the same old annoyances, at least it will be a chance to start fresh as an unknown.At Martin Van Buren High, he quickly attaches himself to a quiet, dark and mysterious girl named Sa5m (Vanessa Hudgens) - the 5 is silent. He also discovers that the cafeteria is used for live band performances and to support the local group the Glory Dogs, led by Ben Wheatly (Scott Porter), a singer/guitarist who is too cool (and too old) for school. Glory Dogs enters every year into the Bandslam competition, a battle-of-the-bands contest that awards the winner with a $10,000 record deal. Ex-Glory Dogs singer Charlotte Banks (Alyson Michalka) discovers that Will has an uncommon knowledge of music and uses him to jumpstart another band to compete in Bandslam, courageously going head-to-head against the school favorite. With his new career as a band manager, the confusing advances by Charlotte (a bound-to-be-trouble blonde with her own Wikipedia page who refuses to answer ""Why"" questions), and his occasionally overbearing mother, will young Burton have time for Sa5m, the girl he really likes?It seems that teen dramedies always get carried away with pure fantasy, most notable when the dorky lead character immediately makes friends with the two hottest girls in school. In similar fashion to School of Rock, he also luckily unites several of the most talented musicians in the state to somehow work together and form an amazingly original band in which everyone has mastered improvisation and spontaneity. Anyone who's actually been through high school will probably wonder where exactly miracles like this take place. Fortunately, although the reality is slim, Bandslam employs enough humor and drama to keep things interesting, along with a good twist at the end and naturally catchy music. It's a film that may not boast the most original premise, but at least teens won't be disappointed in the entertainment value, even if they have to look past the mild PG rating. It's certainly a level more realistic than the High School Musicals.- Mike Massie",3,Bandslam Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1250208000,"08 14, 2009",2009,2905,"['first', 'time', 'year', 'teen', 'film', 'actually', 'appeals', 'teens', 'painfully', 'routed', 'fantasy', 'trend', 'most', 'adolescent', 'movies', 'tend', 'follow', 'interesting', 'characters', 'hip', 'soundtrack', 'target', 'audience', 'likely', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'entertained', 'Formulaic', 'times', 'unpredictable', 'others', 'Bandslam', ""n't"", 'as', 'unique', 'well-timed', 'Amidst', 'really', 'sour', 'teen', 'flicks', 'popping', 'up', 'theaters', 'less', 'immature', 'more', 'comedic', 'generally', 'more', 'fun.Will', 'Burton', 'Gaelan', 'Connell', 'high', 'school', 'life', 'Cincinnati', 'school', 'Guantanamo', 'lunch', 'period', 'Novocain', 'soul', 'providing', 'constant', 'source', 'boredom', 'bullying', 'mother', 'Karen', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'great', 'news', ""'re"", 'going', 'move', 'New', 'Jersey', 'classmates', 'will', 'provide', 'much', 'same', 'old', 'annoyances', 'least', 'will', 'be', 'chance', 'start', 'fresh', 'unknown.At', 'Martin', 'Van', 'Buren', 'High', 'quickly', 'quiet', 'dark', 'mysterious', 'girl', 'named', 'Sa5m', 'Vanessa', 'Hudgens', '5', 'silent', 'also', 'cafeteria', 'used', 'live', 'band', 'performances', 'support', 'local', 'group', 'Glory', 'Dogs', 'led', 'Ben', 'Wheatly', 'Scott', 'Porter', 'singer/guitarist', 'who', 'too', 'cool', 'too', 'old', 'school', 'Glory', 'Dogs', 'enters', 'year', 'Bandslam', 'competition', 'battle-of-the-bands', 'contest', 'winner', '10,000', 'record', 'deal', 'Ex-Glory', 'Dogs', 'singer', 'Charlotte', 'Banks', 'Alyson', 'Michalka', 'Will', 'uncommon', 'knowledge', 'music', 'jumpstart', 'band', 'compete', 'Bandslam', 'courageously', 'going', 'head-to-head', 'school', 'favorite', 'new', 'career', 'band', 'manager', 'confusing', 'advances', 'Charlotte', 'bound-to-be-trouble', 'blonde', 'own', 'Wikipedia', 'page', 'who', 'answer', 'Why', 'questions', 'occasionally', 'overbearing', 'mother', 'will', 'young', 'Burton', 'have', 'time', 'Sa5m', 'girl', 'really', 'teen', 'dramedies', 'always', 'get', 'carried', 'away', 'pure', 'fantasy', 'most', 'notable', 'when', 'dorky', 'lead', 'character', 'immediately', 'friends', 'two', 'hottest', 'girls', 'school', 'similar', 'fashion', 'School', 'Rock', 'also', 'luckily', 'several', 'most', 'talented', 'musicians', 'state', 'somehow', 'work', 'together', 'form', 'amazingly', 'original', 'band', 'everyone', 'mastered', 'improvisation', 'spontaneity', 'Anyone', 'who', 'actually', 'been', 'high', 'school', 'will', 'probably', 'wonder', 'where', 'exactly', 'take', 'place', 'Fortunately', 'reality', 'slim', 'Bandslam', 'enough', 'humor', 'drama', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'good', 'twist', 'end', 'naturally', 'catchy', 'music', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'boast', 'most', 'original', 'premise', 'least', 'teens', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'entertainment', 'value', 'even', 'have', 'look', 'mild', 'PG', 'rating', 'certainly', 'level', 'more', 'realistic', 'High', 'School', 'Musicals.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",Bandslam

1247090,AP3B615GM191G,B0021L8UT4,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[5, 17]","I really didn't expect much out of the viewing experience as I settled in to watch ""Bandslam"".  Pretty much the only reason I rented it was because of the ""Vanessa Hudgens"" name and the fact that I thought my younger sister and I would enjoy watching it together.  Pretty faces and good music...what can go wrong, right?  Unfortunately, the film fell short of even those somewhat less than lofty expectations.For a quick plot summary, the film centers on young high-schooler Will Burton (Gaelen Connell) in the midst of changing schools.  Burton, a classic-rock savant of sorts, is quickly befriended/recruited by fellow student and band-leader Charlotte (Alyson Michalka) in order to use his talents to try and win the school's upcoming ""Bandslam"" competition.  Also in the mix is Sam (Hudgens), an unemotional loner who intrigues Will.The biggest problem with this film (besides featuring some of the dumbest exposition in film history) is that, while it markets itself towards children, the subject matter (classic bands, music terminology) is by and large geared towards nostalgic 80s-teens.  In this aspect, it suffers from the same problem as 2003's ""The School of Rock"", although that movie was able to pull through due to the crazy antics of Jack Black.  Not only that, but the relationships are so contrived that even young children (like my sister) won't be suckered into them.Further bumping this film down a notch is the poor acting, on the whole.  Hudgens (while very beautiful) is by no means a star thespian, while Lisa Kudrow (playing ""Mom Burton"") plays such an annoying character that it is almost physically uncomfortable to watch.  Michalka turns in easily the best performance of the entire piece, with Connell doing a decent job as the lead.  Other than that, there's nothing to get excited about.Thus, if you are considering viewing this video due to Hudgens' ""High School Musical"" reputation, I would recommend the following: Put it down and look elsewhere (as previously mentioned, ""School of Rock"" would be an excellent same-genre choice).
