If you're not into football these probablywon't mean much to you.There's also a great faux documentary on the making of Aqua Teen called 'Radical Axis Presents Radical Axis',but both these extras are better than most of the regular episodes themselves.I will say 'Shake Like Me' was very funny episode, and very out there politically, in the Lenny Bruce traditionof being so politically incorrect you are clearly actually making fun of all racists and racism.This season is worth it if you like the show, but the first 4 seasons seemed much more consistent to me.",4,"A weaker season, but still better than 95% of TV",1300147200,"03 15, 2011",2011,867,"['weakest', '6', 'seasons', 'date', 'still', 'share', 'surreal', 'insane', 'funny', 'moments.I', 'loved', 'Carl', 'series', 'rants', 'NY', 'Giants', 'done', 'eachweek', 'reflect', 'real', 'fortunes', 'team', ""'re"", 'football', 'especiallythe', 'Giants', 'are', 'side-splittingly', 'funny', ""'re"", 'not', 'football', 'probablywo', ""n't"", 'mean', 'much', 'you.There', ""'s"", 'also', 'great', 'faux', 'documentary', 'making', 'Aqua', 'Teen', 'called', ""'Radical"", 'Axis', 'Presents', 'Radical', 'Axis', 'extras', 'are', 'better', 'most', 'regular', 'episodes', 'themselves.I', 'will', 'say', ""'Shake"", 'Me', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'episode', 'very', 'politically', 'Lenny', 'Bruce', 'traditionof', 'being', 'so', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'are', 'clearly', 'actually', 'making', 'fun', 'racists', 'racism.This', 'season', 'like', 'show', 'first', '4', 'seasons', 'seemed', 'much', 'more', 'consistent']",N/A

1186167,A1IMPZYRB79DMS,B001EOQVA4,Movie Fan,"[15, 17]","Vol. 6 of Aqua Teen Hunger Force contains some of the shows best episodes, ever! I liked seven out of the thirteen episodes, and out of those seven, two of them must be considered for any conversation involving ""best Aqua Teen Hunger Force episodes ever"". These classic episodes, in my opinion, are ""Laser Lenses"" and the never before aired ""Shake Like Me"", an episode that will create some controversy for sure.""Laser Lenses"" is similar in some respects to a past episode called ""Unremarkable Voyage"", but it's funnier, and pushes the shows patented surrealistic humor to the limit. Basically, it's an episode where Master Shake is being crueler than usual to his roommates and neighbor, which has been the basis for some of the series best episodes. The origin of Frylock's ability to shoot electricity from his eyes is explained.""Shake Like Me"" was never aired, and once you see it, you'll understand why the network didn't touch it. It's an episode about race. Master Shake is bitten by a radioactive black man, and what follows is hands down one of the series top three best episodes. Just watch it and decide for yourself if the show went too far.The packaging and DVD design is my favorite to date, I love the cover art! The 2-disc set also includes another sheet of stickers just like Vol. Five did which you could use to decorate the solid color DVD discs (although I wouldn't recommend that).If you're a fan of the show, then this is a must buy for the four never aired episodes you can only see here.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[3, 4]","Though it gets off to a bit of a rocky start, the sixth volume of Adult Swim's mega-popular Aqua Teen Hunger Force features more of the unmitigated insanity that any viewer of the show would come to expect.  This rocky start comes from the fact that Master Shake, Frylock, and Meatwad don't appear in the first couple episodes, and instead focus is put on Carl and the new, demonic landlord that has the Aqua Teens captured.  ""Robots Everywhere"" and ""Sirens"" just aren't funny, but from that point forward, the show starts to get back on track.  ""Laser Lenses"", ""Dummy Love"", ""The Marines"", and ""Bible Fruit"" are hilarious, with ""Bible Fruit"" being one of the best episodes in the show's history.  Also included are four unaired episodes, which are worth the price of admission alone.
