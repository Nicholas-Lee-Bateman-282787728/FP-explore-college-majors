Here is a profound,  meaningful, and consistently  moving film about one of the world's greatest saints.  The casting of Daniele Liotti was genius, as the man is unforgettably powerful both before and after his commitment to Christ.  He is quite simply a gorgeous actor, but the beauty is unquestionably spiritual as well as physical. I found the entire film engaging, and the end particularly touching.  These Italian films ( see the one on St. Francis)coming to us through Ignatius Press  are fabulous.  Reading the subtitles is simple, and the soft, gentle voices of the actors are rich and musical as they underscore the written words.  Highly recommended.  And buy it as a gift for those devoted to this great saint, or those who know nothing about him.

I've now watched Saint Anthony a dozen times because I find the struggles of this saint so compelling. It is fascinating how different these two saints were.  St. John Bosco, in the film, seems to know himself so well and he approaches everything with a joy I loved and envy; but the Saint Anthony of this film struggles to reconcile himself with what God wants of him.  He seems rather easier to identify with.  Saint Anthony of Padua was known for his wonderful preaching, and that is beautifully conveyed in this film.  His sermons are both powerful and deeply touching.  I am very impressed with the lead actor, Daniele Liotti, and I thank him for making this saint come alive in such an inspiring film. Glorious cinematography.

And this film beautifully captures the spirit and life of St. Anthony. One of a series of outstanding recent feature films on saints lives produced in Italy (see SAINT RITA, ST. JOHN BOSCO, PADRE PIO:MIRACLE MAN, SAINT FRANCIS), this is wonderful from start to finish. Daniele Liotti is excellent as Anthony, presenting a captivating performance of Anthony as a somewhat complex man who was born into a privileged life, was very talented, and left it all to serve Christ and his fellow man as a Franciscan priest. Liotti convincingly portrays Anthony as a man who struggled with the decision to  sacrifice everything for Christ, as well as with the challenges he faced as a priest, including dark nights of the soul, persecution and death threats, and staying humble in the face of his great spiritual gifts from God, including miraculous healings, countless conversions and powerful preaching.

A the few books I have read on his life the beginning of this movie does not relate to the books. The people in the movie are speaking Italian so you have to read the English translation that scroll across the bottom of the whole movie very quickly. I believe they got some parts of the movie wrong for instance a young monk calls Antonio a nightingale but actually it was St. Francis who was the nightingale. St. Francis in the movie is called Francesco. The movie was very short and Antonio seemed to be angry the whole time that he could not be a martyr. They showed very little of his preaching and little of his miracles. They never showed that the Christ Child appeared to him. They left out so much of his story. The dvd is not worth buying.
