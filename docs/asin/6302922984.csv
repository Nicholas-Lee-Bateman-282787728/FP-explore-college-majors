I've read Dr. Peale's biography, so I know the correct story of his life and this definitely isn't it!  How he must have cringed when this ridiculous movie came out--and everyone who knew him must have been embarrassed for him.  In this film, either the facts are completely wrong, or they're twisted, overdramatized, or left out completely.  The actors look nothing like their real-life counterparts and seem to be dragging their way through the terrible dialogue, scene by boring scene.  Ignore this film and instead watch &#34;Biography: Norman Vincent Peale&#34; by A&E, narrated by Peter Graves, or the PBS version &#34;Positive Thinking: The Norman Vincent Peale Story.&#34;  Both are well-researched and engrossing and accurate!",2,Silly and Dull and Embarrassing!,1358812800,"01 22, 2013",2013,849,"['Hollywood', 'distorted', 'version', 'life', 'great', 'Norman', 'Vincent', 'Peale', 'one', 'favorite', 'authors', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Dr.', 'Peale', 'biography', 'know', 'correct', 'story', 'life', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'How', 'must', 'have', 'cringed', 'when', 'ridiculous', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'everyone', 'who', 'knew', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'embarrassed', 'film', 'facts', 'are', 'completely', 'wrong', ""'re"", 'twisted', 'overdramatized', 'left', 'out', 'completely', 'actors', 'look', 'nothing', 'real-life', 'counterparts', 'seem', 'be', 'dragging', 'way', 'terrible', 'dialogue', 'scene', 'boring', 'scene', 'Ignore', 'film', 'instead', 'watch', '34', 'Biography', 'Norman', 'Vincent', 'Peale', '34', 'A', 'E', 'narrated', 'Peter', 'Graves', 'PBS', 'version', '34', 'Positive', 'Thinking', 'Norman', 'Vincent', 'Peale', 'Story.', '34', 'are', 'well-researched', 'engrossing', 'accurate']",N/A

This is a Limited Edition Collection from MGM so I presume it will be hard to get in years to come. MGM certainly didn't assist themselves in the sales pitch of One Man's Way when they printed the following as being the story line on the DVD's back cover. ""The deserted son of an outlaw gets on the town's bad side after killing a local banker, and years later tries to fit into society by becoming a deputy marshal.""How accurate is this synopsis ? Is it even close to the storyline of One Man's Way ? No siree !!!The Rev Norman Vincent Peale was a Baptist Minister and son of a Preacher Man as well.Growing up,he didn't want any part of being a minister and instead became a journalist as he loved to write.One day there was an explosion in a nearby building and he rushed to see what had happened. The building had disintegrated, and a little girl was hanging precariously,too frightened to crawl to safety across a plank that had been placed for her benefit from an adjoining building. Peale went to her aid, and talked her across the plank to safety,by using God as a reminder to her that she was not alone,nor abandoned, and to trust in Him and His Infinite Goodness.Don Murray had the lead role and he was in nearly every scene with many sermons delivered with a fire and a passion that enthralled his congregations as he built up his churches membership at each parish he was sent to. His wife was played by Diana Hyland (1936 - 1977) who was unforgettable in the movie.What a tragedy she died so young, she had all the hallmarks of a fine actress.The real Rev Peale was apparently quite a controversial character who upset many conservative Christians with his book ""The Power Of Positive Thinking.""This book espouses the belief that our faith and trust in God is a positive belief which can be used in our every day life to assist us in times of self doubt,anxiety,fear of failing etc. This is covered at length in One Man's Way - although I couldn't understand why so many objected.Peale's objection to JFK being a Presidential candidate on the grounds of his Catholicism, was not covered in the movie.There will be comparisons made between One Man's Way and A Man called Peter - also a biography of the life of a gifted Minister,the Scottish born Peter Marshall,and both films serve the Christian faith well.I'm pleased to see One Man's Way on DVD - as I cross it off my list headed Good Films NOT on DVD - or, Why Are We Waiting ?
