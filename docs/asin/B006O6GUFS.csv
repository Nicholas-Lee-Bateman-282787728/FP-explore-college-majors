1517807,A1FQAQO2VKWRN,B006O6GUFS,Andy,"[10, 12]","This sequel to 2010's Mermaid tale continues to develop the story around the conflict between Merliah's human and mermaid heritages. As with any such conflict, Merliah's ultimate happiness depends on her ability to reconcile both in her life.I personally thought this movie was better than the first one.  As a parent, I really liked the messages about working together, forgiveness, overcoming adversity, learning to accept yourself and find joy when your life faces dramatic changes, facing your fears, and especially that there are more important things in life than winning.  I especially liked the closing scenes because of the message that some things are more important than beating the competition and that life can honestly feel a lot better if we allow other people to share in our successes. As a fan of the Barbie movies in general, I was thrilled that Kelly Sheridan voiced Merliah.  For me the voice artist change wasn't a deal breaker, but I definitely prefer Ms. Sheridan as the voice of Barbie. And, my daughter also really liked this movie.There continued to be an emphasis on celebrity that I'm concerned about as a parent, though I was happy to see that while there was some commercialism in this movie, it wasn't as over the top as it has been in some of the recent Barbie movies.  Though, on that note, the preview for Fall's Barbie movie, Princess and the Popstar, has me thinking that the Barbie line is going to continue it's emphasis on celebrity, which isn't thrilling.  I also am concerned that this seems to be a reworking of the Princess and the Pauper concept, which I thought they did so well the first time that they ought to just leave it alone.  But that is the next movie...For Mermaid Tale 2, I would definitely recommend this movie.",5,Mermaid Tale 2...Pretty Cool,1331164800,"03 8, 2012",2012,1770,"['sequel', '2010', 'Mermaid', 'tale', 'develop', 'story', 'conflict', 'Merliah', 'human', 'mermaid', 'heritages', 'such', 'conflict', 'Merliah', 'ultimate', 'happiness', 'ability', 'reconcile', 'life.I', 'personally', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'better', 'first', 'one', 'parent', 'really', 'liked', 'messages', 'working', 'together', 'forgiveness', 'overcoming', 'adversity', 'learning', 'accept', 'find', 'joy', 'when', 'life', 'dramatic', 'changes', 'facing', 'fears', 'especially', 'are', 'more', 'important', 'things', 'life', 'winning', 'especially', 'liked', 'closing', 'scenes', 'message', 'things', 'are', 'more', 'important', 'beating', 'competition', 'life', 'can', 'honestly', 'feel', 'lot', 'better', 'allow', 'other', 'people', 'share', 'successes', 'fan', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'general', 'was', 'thrilled', 'Kelly', 'Sheridan', 'voiced', 'Merliah', 'voice', 'artist', 'change', 'was', ""n't"", 'deal', 'breaker', 'definitely', 'prefer', 'Ms.', 'Sheridan', 'voice', 'Barbie', 'daughter', 'also', 'really', 'liked', 'movie.There', 'continued', 'be', 'emphasis', 'celebrity', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'parent', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'was', 'commercialism', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'top', 'been', 'recent', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'Though', 'note', 'preview', 'Fall', 'Barbie', 'movie', 'Princess', 'Popstar', 'thinking', 'Barbie', 'line', 'going', 'continue', 'emphasis', 'celebrity', ""n't"", 'thrilling', 'also', 'am', 'concerned', 'be', 'reworking', 'Princess', 'Pauper', 'concept', 'thought', 'did', 'so', 'well', 'first', 'time', 'ought', 'just', 'leave', 'alone', 'next', 'movie', 'Mermaid', 'Tale', '2', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'movie']",Barbie in A Mermaid Tale 2

But her mother wants her to transition into princess duties. It causes problems between mother and daughter as a big and important mermaid event approaches (Ceremony of the Tides - where the ruler's ability to make the magic merillia and heal the oceans is renewed). Meanwhile, Merliah's evil Aunt Eris has found the key to escaping her prison by using Merliah's human surfing competitor Kylie Morgan's jealousy against her. A new character, an angelfish named Allister, assists Eris' escape.Barbie/Merliah grapples with issues of identity, responsibility, and being a gracious winner and loser in her surf competitions. As with most Barbie movies, she'll turn Raquelle (Kylie)'s jealousy from a destructive force into a positive friendship. And that friendship will be the key to Merliah accomplishing her goals and saving Oceania. It will also make Kylie a better person and help her reach her aspirations as well. There's a great message that bullying doesn't get you anywhere but that friendships transcend what any one person can accomplish alone.In all, there are a lot of interesting characters this time and a lot of action - my 8 year old was entranced as she rooted for Merliah to arrive in time to prevent Eris from taking over her mother's kingdom. Especially fun are the band of bad guys - moray eels with a little electricity to boot (fun scene from the movie!). Also nice is that the dolls for the movie are inexpensive and all have speaking parts in the series - it makes play acting fun with so many characters to choose from.Those who have enjoyed previous Barbie movies will be glad to hear that Kelly Sheridan is back voicing Barbie.The barbie movies are always a great price and have a lot of replay value for the little ones.

But my seven-year-old daughter expressed an interest in this movie which is a sequel and I decided to rent it first to make sure it really was worth investing in (later found it being shown on TV so I just Tivo-ed it and saved myself some money!).The storyline is interesting - Barbie returns here as a surfer/mermaid Merliah Summers. Merliah is very competitive and is going to Australia to compete for the ultimate surfing title. Merliah's ambition clashes with her duties as a mermaid princess and daughter to Calissa, Queen of Oceania. Calissa wants Merliah to fulfill her responsibilities as a mermaid princess and participate in an important ceremony called Changing of the Tides. However, this duty clashes with Merliah's surfing contest.Meanwhile, the evil mermaid, Eris and her cronies plots to capture the throne of Oceania from Calissa. It is up to Merliah and friends to prevent Eris from achieving her goals. There are positive messages here such as being responsible for one's things, having a sense of duty, and what's important in friendship and sports.The songs are ho-hum, nothing memorable, but the storyline is engaging and kept my daughter's interest. It is a fun movie for girls ages 5-8.",4,7-year-old daughter enjoyed Mermaid Tale 2,1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,1306,"[""'m"", 'more', 'fan', 'traditional', 'animation', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'fan', 'computer', 'animated', 'shows', 'seven-year-old', 'daughter', 'expressed', 'interest', 'movie', 'sequel', 'decided', 'rent', 'first', 'make', 'sure', 'really', 'was', 'worth', 'investing', 'later', 'found', 'being', 'shown', 'TV', 'just', 'Tivo-ed', 'saved', 'money', '.The', 'storyline', 'interesting', 'Barbie', 'here', 'surfer/mermaid', 'Merliah', 'Summers', 'Merliah', 'very', 'competitive', 'going', 'Australia', 'compete', 'ultimate', 'surfing', 'title', 'Merliah', 'ambition', 'clashes', 'duties', 'mermaid', 'princess', 'daughter', 'Calissa', 'Queen', 'Oceania', 'Calissa', 'Merliah', 'fulfill', 'responsibilities', 'mermaid', 'princess', 'participate', 'important', 'ceremony', 'called', 'Changing', 'Tides', 'However', 'duty', 'Merliah', 'surfing', 'contest.Meanwhile', 'evil', 'mermaid', 'Eris', 'cronies', 'plots', 'capture', 'throne', 'Oceania', 'Calissa', 'Merliah', 'friends', 'prevent', 'Eris', 'achieving', 'goals', 'are', 'positive', 'messages', 'here', 'such', 'being', 'responsible', 'one', 'things', 'having', 'sense', 'duty', 'what', 'important', 'friendship', 'sports.The', 'songs', 'are', 'ho-hum', 'nothing', 'memorable', 'storyline', 'engaging', 'kept', 'daughter', 'interest', 'fun', 'movie', 'girls', 'ages', '5-8']",Barbie in A Mermaid Tale 2
