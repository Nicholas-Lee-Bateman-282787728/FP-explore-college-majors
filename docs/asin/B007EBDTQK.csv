1530057,AL1WBEKIEPUPE,B007EBDTQK,"GEORGE RANNIE ""GWRJWMCL""","[2, 2]","Amazon sent me instead of the British mystery that I had ordered this well written, directed and fabulously acted mystery/period drama that is in Swedish (with, of course, English subtitles) ""Anon1790"". Since I own many British mysteries, I decided to give a Swedish version of the genre a try.On five (5) discs with two (2) episodes each that run about an hour and one-half per episode, ""Anon 1790"" follows the exploits of former Swedish  army surgeon closeted revolutionary against the powers in Stockholm Johan Dode who becomes a sort-of ""double agent"" becoming police commissioner in Stockholm.  Dode as police commissioner and his drunkard and skirmish ""sidekick"" solve some horrendous and gruesome cases on the streets and in the houses of Stockholm in 1790 while constantly fighting petty jealousies and the ""self importance"" of the so called upper classes and also fighting being exposed for desiring the overthrow of a corrupt ruling class.  Stockholm in 1790 is shown as a rather crime ridden filthy place--there are scenes that made me squirm.  Dode with his extreme dedication and sympathies for the down-trodden ""under-class"" solves some really nasty cases with sometimes some bloody and gross methods--be aware there are very graphic scenes.I really enjoyed all of the episodes in ""Anon 1790"" because they all are splendidly directed, written and acted plus the era is so well recreated (rats and all).",5,"A delightful ""mistake"" that I am thrilled with",1334534400,"04 16, 2012",2012,1416,"['Amazon', 'sent', 'instead', 'British', 'mystery', 'had', 'ordered', 'well', 'written', 'directed', 'fabulously', 'acted', 'mystery/period', 'drama', 'Swedish', 'course', 'English', 'Anon1790', 'own', 'many', 'British', 'mysteries', 'decided', 'give', 'Swedish', 'version', 'genre', 'try.On', 'five', '5', 'discs', 'two', '2', 'run', 'hour', 'one-half', 'episode', 'Anon', '1790', 'exploits', 'former', 'Swedish', 'army', 'surgeon', 'closeted', 'revolutionary', 'powers', 'Stockholm', 'Johan', 'Dode', 'who', 'sort-of', 'double', 'agent', 'becoming', 'police', 'commissioner', 'Stockholm', 'Dode', 'police', 'commissioner', 'drunkard', 'skirmish', 'sidekick', 'solve', 'horrendous', 'gruesome', 'cases', 'streets', 'houses', 'Stockholm', '1790', 'constantly', 'fighting', 'petty', 'jealousies', 'self', 'importance', 'so', 'called', 'upper', 'classes', 'also', 'fighting', 'being', 'exposed', 'desiring', 'overthrow', 'corrupt', 'ruling', 'class', 'Stockholm', '1790', 'shown', 'rather', 'crime', 'ridden', 'filthy', 'place', 'are', 'scenes', 'made', 'squirm', 'Dode', 'extreme', 'dedication', 'sympathies', 'down-trodden', 'under-class', 'really', 'nasty', 'cases', 'sometimes', 'bloody', 'gross', 'methods', 'be', 'aware', 'are', 'very', 'graphic', 'scenes.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'episodes', 'Anon', '1790', 'are', 'splendidly', 'directed', 'written', 'acted', 'era', 'so', 'well', 'recreated', 'rats']",Anno 1790

Superior acting, beautiful photography with each frame like a painting, unusual cases for our doctor sleuth to solve. It took about two episodes to get me hooked, but hooked I got.

The inclusion of French phrases would have been typical among the upper classes, French being as commonly understood at this time as English is today.  Some of the details in costuming caught my eye -- the dirtiness of people is very noticeable.  Our hero wears a long coat, like a heavy-weight duster, and as he strides down the dirty streets, we see how the mud and wet muck has totally soiled the inside of the coat, up at least a foot or two from its hem.  The 1790's were a dirty time, and you get that watching these people.  The outdoor shots are well thought out, we see the architecture and the lay of the land, and know for sure this is Sweden, not England.  One other thing the episodes point out is that people had no rights, they were at the mercy of a system that sheds no tears for the common man.

Peter Eggers plays Johan Gustav Daadh, an army doctor, who returns to Stockholm with his friend Simon Freund, tutor to the children of the lovely aristocrat Magdalena, his boss's wife. Daadh is at once doctor and criminal inspector. The series is an exciting exploration of the fear and thrill of revolution, of religious freedom and atheism, of the sociology of crime, corruption, and class structure, poverty, wealth, love and love of justice.

An army surgeon reluctantly takes the job as district police commissioner and though he's been trained as a doctor and surgeon he jumps right into police work with simple reasoning to ensure the guilty are caught and the innocent freed. He's also a closet revolutionary and is torn between loyalty to a less than honorable king and his own ideals.
