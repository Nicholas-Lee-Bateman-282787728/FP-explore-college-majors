147122,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0792841786,Acute Observer,"[3, 9]","This 1988 film is based on the 1963 book, which has a more detailed history of this event. Many  items were omitted from this film drama. John Sayles plays the sportswriter Ring Lardner. The film starts by showing the low paid players sweating on the field while the team owner enjoys the luxuries from his monopoly. There was no mention of the 1919 Anti-Trust verdict against the Baseball Cartel, or the later Supreme Court decision that &quot;Baseball was a Sport, not a business&quot; (how much was paid for this decision?). The film then shows how star pitcher Eddie Cicotte was cheated out of his $10,000 bonus. Some of the players are approached by the ever-present gamblers (the book says &quot;Chick&quot; Gandil called up &quot;Sport&quot; Sullivan weeks before the World Series began). The book explains how the best players on the White Sox received poor wages and expense money.The suspicions about the 1919 games were soon forgotten &quot;for the good of the game&quot;. It was a business decision, not personal morality. But the recurrence of &quot;playing just like they did in the World Series&quot; in August 1920 meant that the Baseball Owners would have to make an example. If fixing games meant a loss of dollars from attendance, then the baseball business would end as a professional sport. There were other ways to influence the betting odds: stories of a train wreck and injured players as on 9/10/1920. Money and gambling were as endemic to baseball as to other sports. The eight ballplayers were charged with &quot;conspiracy&quot; in a confidence game - in Chicago! The trial ended in a &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict (a bigger fix than the World Series?). Signed confessions had disappeared! But now baseball, and the owners, were  officially declared clean.A new Baseball Commission banned the eight players from Major League Baseball for life. The ban on &quot;association with gamblers&quot; remains to this day, as Pete Rose learned to his sorrow. Since then the White Sox have never won a World Series. Some talk about a &quot;curse&quot;, but this may just symbolize the reality of life and sports in Chicago. You may wonder if games are still being fixed today? The 1994 strike and the high salaries suggest an end to the temptations of 1919. There are better jackpots in fixing the price of electricity or gasoline. Wall Street is still the Wild West where anything goes unless they can catch you. And many are way too smart to be ever caught,since they use intermediaries to take the blame.Ben Hecht's &quot;The Front Page&quot; gives another view into 1920s Chicago; it is a more lively film. Some say baseball movies don't do well at the box office; maybe it is due to the type of producers who are attracted to this subject?",3,The Purge of Baseball's Chicago Eight,1073952000,"01 13, 2004",2004,2763,"['1988', 'film', 'based', '1963', 'book', 'more', 'detailed', 'history', 'event', 'Many', 'items', 'were', 'omitted', 'film', 'drama', 'John', 'Sayles', 'sportswriter', 'Ring', 'Lardner', 'film', 'starts', 'showing', 'low', 'paid', 'players', 'sweating', 'field', 'team', 'owner', 'luxuries', 'monopoly', 'was', 'mention', '1919', 'Anti-Trust', 'verdict', 'Baseball', 'Cartel', 'later', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'decision', 'quot', 'Baseball', 'was', 'Sport', 'not', 'business', 'quot', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'paid', 'decision', 'film', 'then', 'how', 'star', 'pitcher', 'Eddie', 'Cicotte', 'was', 'cheated', '10,000', 'bonus', 'players', 'are', 'approached', 'ever-present', 'gamblers', 'book', 'quot', 'Chick', 'quot', 'Gandil', 'called', 'up', 'quot', 'Sport', 'quot', 'Sullivan', 'weeks', 'World', 'Series', 'began', 'book', 'how', 'best', 'players', 'White', 'Sox', 'received', 'poor', 'wages', 'expense', 'money.The', 'suspicions', '1919', 'games', 'were', 'soon', 'forgotten', 'quot', 'good', 'game', 'quot', 'was', 'business', 'decision', 'not', 'personal', 'morality', 'recurrence', 'quot', 'playing', 'just', 'did', 'World', 'Series', 'quot', 'August', '1920', 'meant', 'Baseball', 'Owners', 'would', 'have', 'make', 'example', 'fixing', 'games', 'meant', 'loss', 'dollars', 'attendance', 'then', 'baseball', 'business', 'would', 'end', 'professional', 'sport', 'were', 'other', 'ways', 'influence', 'betting', 'odds', 'stories', 'train', 'wreck', 'injured', 'players', '9/10/1920', 'Money', 'gambling', 'were', 'endemic', 'baseball', 'other', 'sports', 'eight', 'ballplayers', 'were', 'charged', 'quot', 'conspiracy', 'quot', 'confidence', 'game', 'Chicago', 'trial', 'ended', 'quot', 'not', 'guilty', 'quot', 'verdict', 'bigger', 'fix', 'World', 'Series', 'Signed', 'confessions', 'had', 'disappeared', 'now', 'baseball', 'owners', 'were', 'officially', 'declared', 'clean.A', 'new', 'Baseball', 'Commission', 'banned', 'eight', 'players', 'Major', 'League', 'Baseball', 'life', 'ban', 'quot', 'association', 'gamblers', 'quot', 'day', 'Pete', 'Rose', 'learned', 'sorrow', 'then', 'White', 'Sox', 'have', 'never', 'won', 'World', 'Series', 'talk', 'quot', 'curse', 'quot', 'may', 'just', 'symbolize', 'reality', 'life', 'sports', 'Chicago', 'may', 'wonder', 'games', 'are', 'still', 'being', 'fixed', 'today', '1994', 'strike', 'high', 'salaries', 'suggest', 'end', 'temptations', '1919', 'are', 'better', 'jackpots', 'fixing', 'price', 'electricity', 'gasoline', 'Wall', 'Street', 'still', 'Wild', 'West', 'where', 'anything', 'can', 'catch', 'many', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'smart', 'be', 'ever', 'caught', 'use', 'intermediaries', 'take', 'blame.Ben', 'Hecht', 'quot', 'Front', 'Page', 'quot', 'view', '1920s', 'Chicago', 'more', 'lively', 'film', 'say', 'baseball', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'due', 'type', 'producers', 'who', 'are', 'attracted', 'subject']",N/A
147123,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,0792841786,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[11, 71]","There will always be the question of importance between sports and money.  Which is more important?  Do today's players participate because they love the game, or is it because they are thrown millions of dollars to play?  It is a question that will continue to be a part of our culture as long as million dollar contracts are signed.  I couldn't help but think of this concept as I watched this film.  In 1919 the players of a winning Chicago baseball team decided to throw in their chances of a World Series title just to earn some extra cash for their pockets.  The results of this game lead to interrogations, an appointment of a baseball commissioner, and a decree that would punish these ball players for the rest of their lives.  For those of us that were not around in 1919 to experience this event first hand, director John Sayles has decided to show us the events first hand through dry cinematography, horrific acting, and a drama that is lacking in ... well ... drama.One of my favorite John Sayles films is Sunshine State.  In it, Sayles takes characters and gives them so much emotion and spirit that you are literally pulled off your couch and glued to the television for the entire two hours.  I wish this were the case for Eight Men Out.  Sadly, where this film lacks is confident actors and a intense and knowledgeable screenplay.  You could tell from the beginning that this topic was a passion of Sayles, but that he also had trouble directing it.  It didn't seem to move as smoothly as some of his other work.  I think one of the main reasons is due to the players that are under his lead.  These are not dramatic actors, but instead some of the ""hottest"" talent that 1988 had to offer.  I kept thinking that he was trying to compete with the 80s teen idols film that was released the same year called Young Guns.  He wanted to have a film that brought those normally not interested in a film of this kind into the theater.  Hey, it worked for me.  John Cusack is not a dramatic character, while later in his career he reaches this level, at this point in his life he is still has that persona of a imaginative teen.  This causes his ""big"" dramatic scenes to seem less and less relevant when they are presented.  Charlie Sheen's accent faded in and out throughout this entire film, while D.B. Sweeney couldn't shake the clich&eacute; ways of his character's lack of education.  Instead of being dramatic, I found myself full of laughter.  I needed stronger actors to pull this film from out of left field.Finally, for those seeking a gritty drama about the hardships of ""rigging"" a game, do not look in this direction.  This is not an Oliver Stone film, this is John Sayles, which means that he is incapable of pushing any buttons.  There were so many directions and dark alleyways that he could have taken us with this film.  I wanted to know more about how these eight men won the trial, I wanted to know more about the confessions, I wanted to know more about the industry, but nothing was handed to me.  I just had to deal with ignorant characters that were about to get five years in prison for their crimes, and nobody was worried.  It infuriated me when the ball players walked into the courtroom and it was nothing but a joke and media frenzy.  It seemed like they didn't care about the trial at all, so which left me no choice but to not care either.  I dislike sports films immensely, and this film is one of the reasons why!Grade:  * out of *****",1,Yesterday.

This is from my point of view because I can relate to the movie more from the gambling aspect. I first really like this movie because it is based on a true story and the one of the biggest sports scandals in history. There is a lot of drama in eight men out and it goes to show you if others are not looking out for you don't mind not looking out for them and stabbing them in the back. That's exactly what the white socks did and cost there team and owner the World Series. Even when the socks tried to get out of the bet they were too far in with the bookies and they already made a commitment and if they turned back now people would be killed. 8 Men Out is filled with up and down moments that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

147125,A1PASRZ81DY9C,0792841786,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 3/14Rate: 83/14: Eight Men Out is the story of the most infamous chapter in professional baseball history: the 1919 World Series fix. The film is actually accurate for most part except for one thing which inevitably loses a point in its rating: the uber famous quote ""Say it ain't so, Joe"" never happened. There is a surprising likeness in John Sayles, the director of the film, as Ring Lardner. You may notice one of the names in the cast as Charlie Sheen is always the one of the three actors pictured in any cover of Eight Men Out. How about getting rid of him and replacing him with David Strathairn or Michael Rooker? They had much more screen time than Charlie who is entirely inconsequential in the film. Speaking of Charlie, notice one scene where he throws his glove in the air and presumably runs to the dugout at the conclusion of an inning. You may find it odd, but it was actually a standard practice back then which was ended by the 1950's. If there is anything off-putting about Eight Men Out, it is the imbalance. Several characters, most notably Buck Weaver, get too much screen time while the rest of the others not so much. That's why I couldn't remember or recall their names or what position they played. I honestly did not know that Eddie Collins played for that team. I found out that much while looking up the internet afterwards. Speaking of that, which is another disappointment about the film and an interesting curio, those who did not participate in the fix would go to be inducted in the Hall of Fame: Eddie Collins, Red Faber, and Ray Schalk. Those who did, well...their infamy will forever be mired in shame.

147130,A1S3C5OFU508P3,0792841786,Charles Ashbacher,"[3, 4]","Until the nineteen seventies, major league baseball players were held in a form of bondage. They could be bought, sold, traded largely against their will and their salaries were fixed artificially low. The reserve clause in their contracts bound them to that team and prevented them from playing for anyone else without explicit permission. If a player's salary was low, their only recourse was to not play, which was a drastic and self-destructive step.The treatment of players in the early twentieth century was often even worse, and there was no more ruthless owner than Charles Comiskey. His salary structure for his quality players was much lower than what existed in the rest of major league baseball. He even let his players take the field in dirty uniforms in order to save on laundry bills. Over and over again he lied to his players and failed to pay them promised bonuses. Therefore, baseball historians rightfully blame him for creating the circumstances that led to the 1919 Chicago White Sox team throwing the World Series. That ruthless desire to save money at all costs on the part of Comiskey is captured in this movie.The inner machinations of the players on the 1919 team are also captured very well. Only a few players were guilty of acts of commission designed to throw the series, others simply knew about it and said nothing to team officials. There was also a great deal of internal dissension on the team, which further inflamed the players. All eight of the players who knew of the conspiracy were banned from baseball for life, even though they were acquitted at trial.The two people who were most unfairly treated were Shoeless Joe Jackson and Buck Weaver. While both knew about the scheme to throw the series, both played very well in the series, hitting over .300 and playing flawlessly in the field. The Jackson character is played very well in this movie; by all accounts he was a nave man who really didn't understand the ramifications of what was going on around him. Weaver tried defending himself as best he could against the charges and tried to get reinstated, but the commissioner was adamant against clemency.A great deal of time is taken in this movie to set the historical backdrop of the 1919 World Series, which is necessary.

The movie features an excellent cast and does a nice job of re-creating the era. The music of period is effectively used here, too, as are the interior and exterior of the ballpark.The most memorable players seemed to be pitcher Eddie Cicotte (David Strathairn) and infielder Buck Weaver (John Cusack). Cicotte, being the ace pitcher on the staff, was the key player involved in fixing the 1919 World Series and Weaver stood out because he was made to look as a totally-innocent player who got unfairly blackballed from pro baseball. At least this is according to John Sayles, who directed the film.Sayles also shows ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson, the most famous player of that scandal, to be just a naive, kind of dumb guy who didn't know what was going on. (However, history records Jackson making an unusual number of throwing errors in the field, which makes him definitely suspect.)Sayles correctly goes out of his way to make Chicago White Sox owner Charles Comiskey as a notorious tightwad who invited this sort of thing (players taking bribes) by grossly underpaying his players.Don't take this story as ""gospel.""

147138,A1LACH6MLQWZ,0792841786,Doug Erlandson,"[1, 1]","""Eight Men Out"" is about the Black Sox Scandal, the successful attempt on the part of eight members of the White Sox to throw the 1919 World Series. All in all, the movie wins points for being relatively historically accurate. Moreover, it presents issues that are ongoing problems for baseball and other sports.First, there is the shortsighted owner, in this case Charlie Comiskey, who, in order to milk the franchise for all it was worth, refused to pay his players a decent salary. (In the days before free agency, this was a perpetual temptation for owners. Comiskey wasn't the only skinflint owner, though he probably was one of the worst.) Not only did this generate ill will on the part of the players, but it certainly made them susceptible to the gamblers who were trying to fix the Series. Shortsighted owners did not cease to exist with the Comiskeys and the Wrigleys of the game. They are still around today.Second, we see the temptation, common to humanity as a whole, to cheat in order to achieve a goal. While the goal was somewhat different for the Black Sox (in that the financial payoff required them to lose), the principle remains. Cheating, with PED's and other ways, either to enhance one's own performance or to beat one's opponents, is still very much a part of professional sports.Finally, the players who were involved in the scandal showed scant concern for the integrity of the game or, for that matter, the law. Whether in 1919 or in the early twenty-first century, there has always been those in sports who put their own self-interest above the interest of the sport itself.In addition to the ongoing relevance of the story, ""Eight Men Out"" is worth watching for a number of other reasons. The acting is outstanding. Almost without exception, all the actors play their parts well. Moreover, the characters, particularly the players who were involved in the fix, are well developed and believable. The background against which the movie is set is also done well; one gets a real understanding of the way things were like on the eve of the Roaring Twenties.",5,Still relevant today,1380585600,"10 1, 2013",2013,2085,"['Eight', 'Men', 'Out', 'Black', 'Sox', 'Scandal', 'successful', 'attempt', 'part', 'eight', 'members', 'White', 'Sox', 'throw', '1919', 'World', 'Series', 'All', 'movie', 'points', 'being', 'relatively', 'historically', 'accurate', 'Moreover', 'issues', 'are', 'ongoing', 'problems', 'baseball', 'other', 'sports.First', 'shortsighted', 'owner', 'case', 'Charlie', 'Comiskey', 'who', 'order', 'milk', 'franchise', 'was', 'worth', 'refused', 'pay', 'players', 'decent', 'salary', 'days', 'free', 'agency', 'was', 'perpetual', 'temptation', 'owners', 'Comiskey', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'skinflint', 'owner', 'probably', 'was', 'one', 'worst', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'generate', 'ill', 'will', 'part', 'players', 'certainly', 'made', 'susceptible', 'gamblers', 'who', 'were', 'trying', 'fix', 'Series', 'Shortsighted', 'owners', 'did', 'not', 'cease', 'exist', 'Comiskeys', 'Wrigleys', 'game', 'are', 'still', 'today.Second', 'see', 'temptation', 'common', 'humanity', 'whole', 'cheat', 'order', 'achieve', 'goal', 'goal', 'was', 'somewhat', 'different', 'Black', 'Sox', 'financial', 'payoff', 'required', 'lose', 'principle', 'Cheating', 'PED', 'other', 'ways', 'enhance', 'one', 'own', 'performance', 'beat', 'one', 'opponents', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'part', 'professional', 'sports.Finally', 'players', 'who', 'were', 'involved', 'scandal', 'showed', 'scant', 'concern', 'integrity', 'game', 'matter', 'law', 'Whether', '1919', 'early', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'always', 'been', 'sports', 'who', 'put', 'own', 'self-interest', 'interest', 'sport', 'itself.In', 'addition', 'ongoing', 'relevance', 'story', 'Eight', 'Men', 'Out', 'worth', 'watching', 'number', 'other', 'reasons', 'acting', 'outstanding', 'Almost', 'exception', 'actors', 'play', 'parts', 'well', 'Moreover', 'characters', 'particularly', 'players', 'who', 'were', 'involved', 'fix', 'are', 'well', 'developed', 'believable', 'background', 'movie', 'set', 'also', 'done', 'well', 'one', 'real', 'understanding', 'way', 'things', 'were', 'eve', 'Roaring', 'Twenties']",N/A

147145,A1V62VJ7U3X0DM,0792841786,Jamakaya,"[0, 0]","A close look at the infamous Chicago ""Black Sox"" scandal of 1919, ""Eight Men Out"" is one of the best American period dramas and baseball movies. All of the actors, including those who were coming into prominence like John Cusack, Charlie Sheen and David Strathairn, and lesser known actors like Michael Rooker and Gordon Clapp, breathe life into their characters and show the different motivations of the players who cooked (or refused to cook) the World Series that year. John Mahoney is dynamite as Coach Kid Gleason, who is disappointed by his guys but ultimately stands by them. D. B. Sweeney is a heartbreaker as the hapless ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson. ""Eight Men Out"" is incredibly thoughtful while also being thoroughly entertaining.Writer-director John Sayles places the personal dramas of Shoeless Joe, Buck Weaver and others within the context of the thriving gambling culture surrounding baseball, the exploitation of the players by owners like Charles Comiskey, and the overall corruption of the sporting, legal and political establishments. The media of the time played a critical role in exposing the scandal. John Sayles and Studs Terkel are a bit stiff as sports writers Ring Lardner and Hugh Fullerton, who smelled a fix and wouldn't let the story go. The baseball action is filmed really well and the dialog is very sharp. It's become a kind of shorthand to say the Black Sox scandal came to symbolize an end of American innocence. ""Eight Men Out"" even includes the classic scene (possibly invented) of a baseball-smitten kid pleading to his hero, Shoeless Joe: ""Say it ain't so, Joe.""I really liked the extras on the 20th anniversary DVD, which include a director's audio commentary, a historical documentary about the Black Sox scandal, and a 2-part documentary on the making of the film. Especially interesting are the descriptions of how the filmmakers recreated the uniforms, equipment and stadiums of the time.

147146,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,0792841786,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[8, 9]","In 1919, the Chicago White Sox faced the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series.  It was supposed to be an easy victory for the White Sox.  After all, they had the best team in the league by far that year.  What happened in the end has shocked the baseball world ever since.  The White Sox threw the world series and let the Reds win.  This movie does a wonderful job of telling the story of the White Sox aka &quot;Black Sox&quot; during that fateful year.  John Cusack, D.B. Sweeney, and David Strathairn are the stars of the film, playing Buck Weaver, Joe Jackson, and Eddie Cicotte.  Charlie Comiskey's infamous penny pinching is shown in the film as Cicotte was due a bonus in his contract for winning 30 games.  He ended up winning 29 despite being injured for a time, but Comiskey still didn't give Cicotte his bonus.  This had a major influence on Cicotte deciding to help throw the series.  Sweeney does an excellent job as Jackson, the sharp hitting illiterate outfielder.  He didn't take the bribe and had an excellent series, hitting well over .300.  The game scenes are excellent, and the behind the scenes action with the announcers and crooks is well-done as well.  In the end, each player was acquitted by a court of law for any wrong-doing, but Commissioner Kenisaw Mountain Landis, regardless of the jury's verdict, still banned the 8 Sox players from ever playing baseball again.  The movie ends with Buck Weaver (Cusack) watching an old but still great Jackson (Sweeney) playing in a semi-pro game somewhere in the South.  Baseball fans will surely love this excellent movie.

A book can give you much more detail an insight then a two hour movie, but the John Sayles movie does a great job telling the complex story.  In order to save screen time and to give the viewer the  back stories, he relates incidents which occured in the Chisox 1917  Championship season and before, but places them in the 1919 Season. This  helps to develop the characters and makes it much more enjoyable. It's a  great peorid piece.It is very true to the book, which I would also  reccomend reading. Did you know other gamblers tried to get Reds pitchers  drunk to have the Redlegs lose?This story has no simularites to the Pete  Rose ruling. Eddie Cicote, the 35 year old major league vet, was making  less then a Reds pitcher who was in his sophmore season. The Whitesox  players were getting royally ripped off. They had to eat it. There was no  free agency. Baseball was making lots of money for the owners then. I can't  say many people wouldn't have done the same thing if in his position.

This particular movie concentrates on the Chicago White Sox scandal of 1919. Several players agreed to accept money to throw some games in the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds. The event became known as ""The Black Sox Scandal"" but that was not the reason why they became known as ""The Black Sox"". The real story behind that nickname is that the owner of the White Sox discovered he could save a few nickels by having the team be responsible individually for their own clothing maintenance. This resulted in shabby appearances in their uniforms and therefore ""Black Sox"" became the team name.  Well, the fact is that the owner was gracious to those who could make him look good, as in the press. He is shown treating them like gold. The players are treated as some sort of bottom feeding basement trolls who don't deserve anything but leftover scraps from the King's table. The truth lies somewhere in-between and this movie conveys the message very well. There are not many major actors, no big leads, but the film plays out well and there are interesting game scenes in what is basically almost a clean movie. There was no radio back then so every situation was delivered over morse code messages by wire. It is very entertaining, interesting and portrays the era well enough.

147152,A168IJYQKYKBGP,0792841786,kubwell627,"[0, 0]","This movie is in my all time top 10 personal favorite films!! I love the way Sayles tells the story, and how the Amazing cast gives depth to their characters. This is a top notch cast, with Strathan, Cusack, and Sweeny doing some of their best work. Th e special features on the disc are excellent! They include a two part retrospective on the film, a story behind the film, and a nice, if a bit monotone Audio commentary from sayles. If you like this movie and own the DVD it is worth the upgrade to this edition. It is amazing to realize they made this film in 2 months, and for $6 million. It is beautifully shot, and the costumes, music, and sets are all top notch, especially considering the budget constraints. Finally I want to say again how superb this cast is, Sheen, and John Mahoney as the manager, plus Christopher LLoyd, and The Great Micheal Lerner as Arnold Rothstein  the notorious Gambler who bankrolls the fix. After all the corruption, and the lies between the gamblers, and the players, Baseball continued to make money as did the owners, the gamblers made a steal and got no trouble, but the 8 ball players got banned for life, it is a heartbreaking tale of innocence lost.  On another note I can not believe that list after list has movies ahead of this, such as a league of their own, money ball, the natural, and worst of all, Bull Durham, that movie is a piece o poo! Costner and Robbins could NOT be more unbelievable as ball players, costner looks 42, and Robbins looks like he wouldn't know a curve ball, from a high ball. No Other baseball movie, puts baseball in it's true context with America. Baseball is the national sport, and it has seen all the changes, and the 1919 series, and the aftermath, was a microcosm of our nation. The hope, believe, the betrayal, and the sense, that when it was all over, the men in charge, stayed in charge, and the ""middle class"" players are discarded. Yet 100 years later, Shoeless Joe is still remembered, as are the Sox, but the stigma will never go away.

147153,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0792841786,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[85, 89]","Every time I watch &quot;Eight Men Out&quot; I am not really sure how I stand on the question of whether or not &quot;Shoeless&quot; Joe Jackson should be in the Hall of Fame, but the film certainly reaffirms my long held belief that justice might best be served if Charlie Comisky was kicked out of the shrine of baseball immortals.  It is useful to remember that the team was already known as the Black Sox before the 1919 World Series because they refused to pay for their own laundry when Comisky decided there were additional nickels to be made from cutting that particular corner.  What Comisky did to create an environment on his team that gamblers were able to exploit is amply set up.  Even before the gamblers double-cross the boys and have to take extra steps to ensure the outcome of the series against the Reds, it is Comisky's arrogant dictatorship that makes us look with some measure of sympathy towards the Black Sox.  Director John Sayles, who takes a turn as sportswriter Ring Lardner singing &quot;I'm Forever Throwing Ball Games&quot; on the train carrying the team, this 1988 film certainly gets the most out of its limited budget.  Based on Eliot Asniof's book, which is a very detailed account of the entire scandal, the film focuses on the eight men who, for various reasons, ended up throwing away their reputations and their careers.  The details on the scandal are in the book; Sayle's film focuses on the basic elements are the moral ambiguities of a complex chain of human actions.Certainly the tragic figure in &quot;Eight Men Out&quot; is not Jackson (D.B. Sweeney), who certainly receives his biggest cinematic boost from &quot;Field of Dreams,&quot; but rather Buck Weaver (John Cusack).  Weaver's sin was that he failed to rat out his teammates once he knew there was talk of a fix.  Judge Kenisaw Mountain Landis, a necessary evil as the game's first commissioner, needed to scrap out the cancer of this scandal even if it meant cutting to the bone.  That meant that Weaver, who was the third baseman on Ty Cobb's all-time team, suffers the same banishment for life from the game he loves as those who took payments to throw the World Series.  Weaver's nobility is further enhanced in the film because he is the one who has time for the kids in the sandlot and who believes that the lessons he learned as a boy playing the game still apply not only to baseball but also to life.  Jackson is something of a cipher in the film, more legend than flesh and blood human being.  Consequently, Weaver's character stands in contrast to Chick Gandil (Michael Rooker), the limited &quot;brains&quot; behind the scandal and Eddie Cicotte (David Strathairn), the star most wronged by Comisky the skinflint.  Even at the end of the film, when we see &quot;Shoeless&quot; Joe on a semi-pro field playing under an assumed name, it is Weaver who offers the film's benediction from the stands and Weaver who emerges as the most sympathetic figure.

147154,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,0792841786,Linda Linguvic,"[21, 23]","This 1988 film, directed by John Sayles, has a lot going for it.  It's a dramatization of the underpaid Chicago White Sox who took bribes to throw the 1919 World Series.  It's historically significant as a real event that happened and it's also the story of baseball and what it was like in that era.  John Cusak is cast in the role of Buck Weaver, a ballplayer who doesn't want to participate but keeps quiet nevertheless.  The other actors are less familiar to me.The owner of the team, Charlie Cominsky, was a difficult man to work for.  When his team won the pennant he gave them flat champagne instead of the $10,000 bonuses he promised them.  And because he had promised a pitcher a bonus for winning 30 games, he purposely benched him so that the pitcher could win no more than 29.  Salary was $6,000 per year and they had to do their own laundry.  This was a team that was ripe for exploitation by the gambling interests at the time.  Arnold Rothstein, the famous gambling tsar, manipulates everybody, but his role gives some insight into his character.  And Ring Lardner and John Sayles himself play sportswriters.  I was confused by the ballplayers though.  Perhaps if I was familiar with this particular 1919 team I would have been able to recognize them, but they looked alike and all blended together in my mind.The best part of the film was the historical detail.  There was no radio or television then.  So if you weren't in the ballpark, you had to go to a gambling parlor where a gentleman with a stuffy accent read the play-by-play from tickertape.  There was a large baseball diamond on the wall and another man would chart out the game as it was read from the tickertape.  The acting was good, the moral dilemmas clear.  The players wound up double-crossed by the gamblers and then put on trial.  All this was fascinating.  Especially since it was true.  However, the film just misses getting a high recommendation from me because of my confusion about the ballplayers.  But if you don't particularly care who was who and want to relive a small piece of American history, you'll like this video, especially if you're a baseball fan.",4,Baseball in 1919 and the tainted World Series of that year,990230400,"05 19, 2001",2001,2152,"['1988', 'film', 'directed', 'John', 'Sayles', 'lot', 'going', 'dramatization', 'underpaid', 'Chicago', 'White', 'Sox', 'who', 'took', 'bribes', 'throw', '1919', 'World', 'Series', 'historically', 'significant', 'real', 'event', 'happened', 'also', 'story', 'baseball', 'what', 'was', 'era', 'John', 'Cusak', 'cast', 'role', 'Buck', 'Weaver', 'ballplayer', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'participate', 'quiet', 'nevertheless', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'less', 'familiar', 'me.The', 'owner', 'team', 'Charlie', 'Cominsky', 'was', 'difficult', 'man', 'work', 'When', 'team', 'won', 'pennant', 'gave', 'flat', 'champagne', 'instead', '10,000', 'bonuses', 'promised', 'had', 'promised', 'pitcher', 'bonus', 'winning', '30', 'games', 'purposely', 'benched', 'so', 'pitcher', 'could', 'win', 'more', '29', 'Salary', 'was', '6,000', 'year', 'had', 'do', 'own', 'laundry', 'was', 'team', 'was', 'ripe', 'exploitation', 'gambling', 'interests', 'time', 'Arnold', 'Rothstein', 'famous', 'gambling', 'tsar', 'everybody', 'role', 'insight', 'character', 'Ring', 'Lardner', 'John', 'Sayles', 'play', 'sportswriters', 'was', 'confused', 'ballplayers', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'familiar', 'particular', '1919', 'team', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'recognize', 'looked', 'alike', 'blended', 'together', 'mind.The', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'historical', 'detail', 'was', 'radio', 'television', 'then', 'So', 'were', ""n't"", 'ballpark', 'had', 'go', 'gambling', 'parlor', 'where', 'gentleman', 'stuffy', 'accent', 'read', 'play-by-play', 'tickertape', 'was', 'large', 'baseball', 'diamond', 'wall', 'man', 'would', 'chart', 'out', 'game', 'was', 'read', 'tickertape', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'clear', 'players', 'wound', 'up', 'double-crossed', 'gamblers', 'then', 'put', 'trial', 'was', 'fascinating', 'Especially', 'was', 'true', 'However', 'film', 'just', 'getting', 'high', 'recommendation', 'confusion', 'ballplayers', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'who', 'was', 'who', 'want', 'relive', 'small', 'piece', 'American', 'history', ""'ll"", 'like', 'video', 'especially', ""'re"", 'baseball', 'fan']",N/A
147155,A1FNW6H983I87V,0792841786,"Loves To Read ""Lu""","[2, 2]","This is the story of the 1919 Chicago White Sox scandal in which 8 of the players were bribed to 'throw' the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds, in which they were heavily favored. The Series had changed to best of 9 games that year so the star pitcher who won 29 games would get at least three starts. Without his participation in the scandal, they would have been unbeatable. He became 'in' when Sox owner Charlie Comiskey refused to pay him his bonus for winning 30 games because he 'only' won 29. Comiskey had ordered him benched toward the end of the season for two weeks, missing five starts, to prevent him from reaching 30 wins and earning the bonus. This was but one example of Comiskey 'cheating' his players out of money they had earned. At that time, the owner was king. There were no unions and not even a commissioner for the players to appeal to. This is a fascinating story about a major black spot on Major League Baseball and subject to much discussion as to whether all the players implicated really did intentionally play below their ability. Roger Ebert's lower rating is primarily due to his feeling you had to have too much knowledge of the scandal and the individual players before watching the movie because the individual players and other characters were not identified clearly and distinctly early on in the film. His criticism does have some merit but certainly not enough to avoid this very interesting incident in Major League Baseball and one of the few full-fledged scandals in profession sports, although steroid use may end up being right up there. The costumes and settings are well done and give you a real feel for the period. Another interesting sidelight is the players' relationship to the community. They were a real part of the community, even walking back and forth from home to the stadium for games and, of course, travel by train provided for a much different environment between players and the sportswriters who traveled along.

The ""costumes"", consisting of mostly baseball uniforms and 1919 atmosphere are wonderful. This viewer especially liked the guy singing the National Anthem before game 8 of the Series with a hand held megaphone! (The Fall Classic had a best of nine format that year).The largely unknown cast, at least to this reviewer, is solidly professional. Director Sayles, like the great John Ford, apparently liked to use a stock crew in his films. Standing out are John Mahoney as Sox' manager Kid Gleason and John Cusack as 3rd baseman Buck Weaver. One unsettling scene occurs when owner Charles Comiskey stiffs star pitcher Eddie Cicotte out of his prospective bonus for winning 30 games by benching him after the 29th! More unsettling is a direct threat against pitcher Lefty Williams if he fails to carry through on the plot. The action the field action is very convincingly shot.

The movie tells the story about one of baseball's darkest days; the 1919 World Series scandal. Seven baseball players from the White Sox team decide to throw the World Series due to the own of the team poor treatment to the players. Though one of them, Buck Weaver, defends his innocents. The movie opens with the last game of the 1919 baseball season. The White Sox have won the American League Pennant and face the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series. Gamblers start to think about bribing some of the White Sox players into throwing the World Series. Charles Arnold ""Chick"" Gandil let it be know that for the right amount of money that he would throw the World Series. He is approached by Joseph J. ""Sport"" Sullivan and Chick recruits seven more players. The only person that does not go along is Buck Weaver. The other six players who join Chick to fix the World Series are: Eddie Cicotte, Oscar ""Happy"" Felsch, Joe Jackson, Fred McMullin, Charles ""Swede"" Risberg, and Claude ""Lefty"" Williams. The main reason for the players for throwing the World Series is their boss and owner of the White Sox Charles Comiskey. Charles was one of the cheapest owners of baseball and even making players pay for their cleaning of their uniforms. When Eddie Cicotte hit Morrie Rath on the second pitch; that was the signal that to the gamblers that the fix was on. The White Sox go on to loose the first and second game of the series. Dickie Kerr, the starting pitcher for game three and not involved with the fix, goes on to win game three. The Reds wins the next two games which put the Reds four games to one in a best of nine series. Dickie goes on to win game six. By the time game seven rolls around some of the players who have not been paid the full of amount for throwing the World Series revolt and decide to play clean baseball on game seven making the gamblers nervous. Lefty Williams is approach by one of the gamblers and tell him to loose or his wife dies. Lefty pitches a bad first inning and is pulled from the game, but not before the damage is done. The Reds go on to win the World Series. It was not until Hugh Fullerton starting writing articles and uncovering the scandal that a grand jury was assembled to investigate the allegations. All eight members of the 1919 White Sox are taken to court for gambling charges but were found not guilty. With baseball trying to clean up their act; owners from both leagues appointed Kenesaw Mountain Landis as the first Commissioner of Baseball. Then Kenesaw in one of his first acts a Commissioner of Baseball banned all eight players for life. The aftermath of the eight players were:Eddie Cicotte worked in various jobs after his ban included working in the Ford Motor Companay, berry farmer, and Game Warden.Oscar ""Happy"" Felsch played on various semi-pro baseball leagues.Joe ""Shoeless"" Jackson played or managed on various minor league teams for the next twenty years and after that ran a dry cleaning business and finally a liquor store called Joe Jackson's Liquor Store.Fred McMullin-unknownCharles ""Swede"" Risberg played semi-pro baseball for the next ten plus years. He played for a team called the Mesaba Range Black Sox. After his baseball career was over he worked on a dairy farm and a tavern and lumber business. He was the last of the eight to die.George ""Buck"" Weaver tried six unsuccessful times for reinstatement to baseball before he passed away and failed all six times.Claude ""Lefty"" Williams played briefly for the Fort Bayard Veterans and would wind up running a garden nursery business.The movie seems to be true to fact, but it suggests it all took place in the same year. The players were not banned from baseball till the end of the 1920. If nothing else, I like the period clothing back then.

147165,A1QO6HTLVZ4MMC,0792841786,"MrPepper67 ""Don""","[1, 2]","Being a baseball fan for many years, I just had to review this film.  I don't believe it is as good as other classic baseball films such as Pride Of The Yankees, or Fear Strikes Out, and it may not even be as good as other contemporary baseball films such as Field Of Dreams or Bull Durham, but it well-made, and well-acted.  I'm not sure if it is entirely correct in the handling of the outcome of the Black Sox scandal.  I think the film's director, John Sayles, takes a bit too much liberty with baseball history...but then this is one man's interpretation of those events.  I think in particular we don't know to what extent Buck Weaver fought back against the conspiracy charges.  Yes, he did indeed say later that he did not agree to participate in throwing the World Series that year in 1919, but that's about all we know for sure.  Remember in those days, you didn't fight the courts, and baseball players then couldn't afford to fight the legal system even if they wanted to, and baseball surely wouldn't support their cause.  As a result, I sincerely doubt if Buck Weaver appealed Commissioner Landis' decision to bar the players in question here.  I'm not even sure if that is suggested in the film, but nevertheless, I do like the insights about the Black Sox controversey here.  I would have stood behind Buck Weaver in his fight to lift his suspension to get back in the game, but I do think Landis' was justified in his actions in those days under those circumstances.  He had to do something to restore the public's faith in the game.  He had no choice but kick all eight players out of the game.  However, I truly came to sympathize with the players in question here, particularly Buck Weaver, after seeing this film.  I would have cheered them all to the rafters had I known they rebelled against the conspiracy and genuinely tried to win in the end, but I do think all eight players, including Buck Weaver, were guilty because they didn't report their acts to the authorities.  If they had done so, they would have become martyred heroes instead of criminals.  In Lefty Williams' case, I would have gone straight to the police after Rothstein's hoods came to threaten his wife.  But in the end, I would say to watch this film and make up your own mind.

I'm certainly not an insider, not even an avid fan, but I had no trouble following the story. In fact, I thought it was told with unusual clarity and elegance. And the actors were perfectly cast. Each seemed to slip into his role as comfortably as an old shoe. They weren't actors playing ball players. They were ball players. The movie flowed perfectly as the gamblers first approached a couple of the more receptive players. You could easily see the others being slowly drawn into the fix by the lure of easy money. You could also see, even before the players did, that they were nothing more than suckers themselves. They would not get the money - ever. Go to bed with criminals expect to get robbed. Roger Ebert was concerned about the way the ""fix"" unfolded, saying it was far too obvious. Of course it was! That's why they were caught!Some of the other reviews here justify the actions of these players, based on the way their owner treated them. Man! That's certainly 2008 logic. They commited a serious criminal act! What's so hard to understand. Are we now at a point where unfair treatment legitimizes criminal actions? Yeah, many of the owners were most likely rotten. Yeah, the players were not treated fairly but NO, that doesn't justify their actions, including the ones who were guilty by omission. They let themselves down, they let the league down, but most of all, they let the fans down (Remember, ""Say it ain't so, Joe?"") Judge Landis was a tyrant but he did the right thing.The last scene, where a much older Bucky Weaver sits in the bleachers of some nameless sandlot ballpark watching his old team mate, Joe Jackson, play is heartbreaking and sums up the movie perfectly.The bottom line is: this movie is a wonderful example of intelligent story-telling and film-making.

147171,A1U8DHSI18EEJ1,0792841786,Richard E. Noble,"[2, 3]","MovieEight Men OutReviewBy Richard Edward NobleI'm really not much of a baseball fan or expert. I knew about this scandal, of course, but I knew little of the details.On the other hand, I am very much interested in the American Labor Movement. I have written one book on this subject already and I am reading constantly about this giant area of American controversy. I would like to write more on this very much hidden and underplayed part of American history.Little did I know that this movie would be a Labor/Management controversy and right up my alley of interests.The owner/manager, Mr. Comisky, is right out of the typical 1920's mold for rich business owners and Robber Barons of the period.The way he exploits, cheats and lies to his players is directly out of the Rockefeller/Carnegie/Morgan handbook for abusive treatment of the working stiff. And the ball players of that day were the working stiffs of that industry.One of the star pitchers in the movie was promised a bonus ($5000??) for getting 30 wins in one season. He needed one more win with five games left to play to win his bonus.Comisky benched him.Comisky didn't really care if the team won or lost those games because their super pitcher was on the bench. He was more concerned with saving himself the 5,000 bucks. This guy makes John Steinbrenner look like a baseball team owner hero and philanthropist.He promised the team a ten thousand dollar bonus for winning the championship. They win and get several bottles of flat champagne instead. No mention of the 10 thousand bucks.These are just a couple of examples pointed out in the movie. The movie was replete with Mr. Comisky's disgusting antics in the abusive treatment of his superstars.It was laughable to see all the same unscrupulous business tactics used on mine workers, textile workers, steel workers and the like of that era being used on these baseball stars - laughable but very sad.Several players on the 1919 Chicago White Sox team get together in an attempt to get from other sources what they can't get from their conniving, underhanded bossman.They team up with a tough crowd of gangster bookies and gamblers in an attempt to get their just deserts.They didn't know what they were getting into. Once committed, their lives were on the line. Gangsters have that Mafia adage, ""I'll make them an offer they can't refuse.""They are involved in breaking the law, of course. But what about Comisky?Interestingly enough, Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis is notorious in the annals of Labor history.He was the Judge who put many of the Labor activists protesting World War I into long term, jail sentences.He presided over the IWW trials and sentenced the whole group of hundreds to prison. He was a harsh, abusive man with an unembarrassed biased towards the rich and powerful. Another giant historical disgrace.When the players were found not guilty, he took the law into his own hands as was his penchant. In this case, he was free to be both judge and jury so he had no need to resort to intimidating the jury or disgracing defendants as he was so capable of doing in his previous legal capacity.He decided to convict all the players involved regardless of the court's decision.He banned all of the accused, innocent or guilty, from ever playing professional baseball again.Granted, some of them were guilty but what about Comisky?But it was no crime to cheat and exploit workers in those days ... and it still isn't.Every day here in America workers leave their homes to go to work and never return. They are killed on the job by employers who do not adhere to safety standards and other code violations.This happened recently on an oil rig out in the Gulf of Mexico and just a few weeks ago at a fertilizer plant in Texas.Workers being killed on the job is accepted as accidental. Such was the case for many, many years with drunk driving. How could a drunk driver be held responsible, after all, the poor man was drunk. How can we hold the poor businessman legally accountable, after all the poor guy is just trying to make a buck.Such is still the case with businessmen who violate safety codes and refuse to meet even minimum standards for worker safety.It seems to happen every day lately in Bangladesh but it happens everywhere, in China, India, Europe, South America, Africa, Indochina, Asia - wherever there are workers and business owners.This movie is typical of the labor practices of the period.I found this movie very interesting and shocking for reasons other than the obvious.Yes, some of the players accused cheated but why did these basically honest, hard working superstars cheat? Why did they have to cheat? What drove them to cheat?So here we have the story behind the story finally brought out into the open.Great movie. I loved it. Good acting too.The Hobo Philosopher - Richard Edward Noble is a writer and author of ""America On Strike.""",5,The Hobo Philosopher,1368835200,"05 18, 2013",2013,4897,"['MovieEight', 'Men',

John Sayles, like Oliver Stone, is an obvious agit-prop master for the left or at least for labor in its battle against owners. But so are several others movie-makers. However, those others do not get the responses that Sayles has evoked because they don't have half the talent that Sayles possesses. There is no fence-sitting when watching his films, and that's because his visions and messages are clear, uncompromising and passionate. EIGHT MEN OUT is one of his highest achievements in those regards.In his analysis of the rigging of the World Series of 1919, Sayles targets White Sox owner Comiskey as the true villain. And I believe this is accurate, if not justifiable, at the very least. The Black Sox scandal, as it came to be known, was undoubtedly the lowest point in baseball history, but it could have been avoided. Had Comiskey treated his players as they merited, it is doubtful any of it would have come about. This is not to say that these athletes were angelic: Sayles goes to great lengths to show that several of them would be easily corruptible, such as Chick Gandil (played by the underrated Michael Rooker). Other players seem to want to do the right thing, but are pushed too far by Comiskey--specifically, Eddie Cicotte, as portrayed by Sayles' favorite, David Strathairn. The enigmatic Shoeless Joe Jackson (subtly played by D.B. Sweeney) is just plain too dumb to understand the implications of his involvement. As others have noted, Jackson wound up the series' batting leader.The real moral compass of EIGHT MEN OUT is Buck Weaver, played by John Cusack in what may have been the performance of his career. Sayles' Weaver is portrayed as the victim of the ultimate betrayal for not participating in the scheme. His teammates don't back him up. The courts do not defend him. The press lumps him together with the guilty. His only crime was not being a snitch. And for that, Weaver has basically been relegated to baseball history's limbo, in spite of an above-par career. Sayles does an admirable job in evoking a justified sympathy for Buck Weaver, and Cusack captures it beautifully.EIGHT MEN OUT is not a mere baseball movie. Like much of Sayles' work, it's a film about greed, and the desire of American owners to extract as much from labor as possible, without giving anything in return.P.S. -- Sayles does a great job of portraying writer Ring Lardner.

One pitcher wanted the bonus he felt he deserved as he was promised to be paid after 30 games.  But Cominsky held him to the bench long enough to not quite make that 30 game deal.  Sorry pal, 29 is not 30.The film tries to be historically accurate to the days just before the Roaring Twenties, but here John Sayles (director) tries a little too hard.  The cars, the music, the kids and the streets are played to such a showcase extent, that I'm saying ""Where's the story?""  Pretty, but let me see some ball.And I do!  It's obvious that the guys are throwing the game.  And though several change their minds -- and get threats on their lives as a result from worried gangster gamblers -- it may not be enough to save their careers.  I did like the sports reporters as they put two and two together, and started typing really fast in henpeck style on their ancient Royals (investigative reporters (played by Studs Terkel and Sayles himself). Loved these guys.  And Christopher Lloyd playing a tough guy for a change was fun, too.The newly appointed commissioner had other plans for the ""Black Sox"".The bottom line, though the film is fun to watch and it's historically pretty in its 1919 ambiance, it remains a bit unfocused at times and could have been tighter in its presentation.Other Baseball Films:Major League (Wild Thing Edition)The Natural (Director's Cut)The Bad News BearsAnd some historical stuff about the Black Sox scandal:The Black Sox Scandal of 1919 (Cornerstones of Freedom Second Series)The Wrong Man OutEight Men Out: The Black Sox and the 1919 World Series",4,These Sox are Tarnished -- Great Film of an American Tragedy,1271980800,"04 23, 2010",2010,1840,"['film', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'authored', 'Eliot', 'Asinof', 'regarding', 'Black', 'Sox', 'scandal', '1919', 'where', 'Chicago', 'White', 'Sox', 'threw', 'World', 'Series', 'gambling', 'money.The', 'owner', 'Cominsky', 'players', 'reason', 'resent', 'One', 'pitcher', 'wanted', 'bonus', 'felt', 'deserved', 'was', 'promised', 'be', 'paid', '30', 'games', 'Cominsky', 'held', 'bench', 'long', 'enough', 'not', 'quite', 'make', '30', 'game', 'deal', 'Sorry', 'pal', '29', 'not', '30.The', 'film', 'tries', 'be', 'historically', 'accurate', 'days', 'just', 'Roaring', 'Twenties', 'here', 'John', 'Sayles', 'director', 'little', 'too', 'hard', 'cars', 'music', 'kids', 'streets', 'are', 'played', 'showcase', 'extent', ""'m"", 'saying', 'Where', 'story', 'Pretty', 'let', 'see', 'ball.And', 'do', 'obvious', 'guys', 'are', 'throwing', 'game', 'several', 'change', 'minds', 'get', 'threats', 'lives', 'result', 'worried', 'gangster', 'gamblers', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'enough', 'save', 'careers', 'did', 'sports', 'reporters', 'put', 'two', 'two', 'together', 'started', 'typing', 'really', 'fast', 'henpeck', 'style', 'ancient', 'Royals', 'investigative', 'reporters', 'played', 'Studs', 'Terkel', 'Sayles', 'Loved', 'guys', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'playing', 'tough', 'guy', 'change', 'was', 'fun', 'too.The', 'newly', 'appointed', 'commissioner', 'had', 'other', 'plans', 'Black', 'Sox', '.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'film', 'fun', 'watch', 'historically', 'pretty', '1919', 'ambiance', 'bit', 'unfocused', 'times', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tighter', 'presentation.Other', 'Baseball', 'Films', 'Major', 'League', 'Wild', 'Thing', 'Edition', 'Natural', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Bad', 'News', 'BearsAnd', 'historical', 'stuff', 'Black', 'Sox', 'scandal', 'Black', 'Sox', 'Scandal', '1919', 'Cornerstones', 'Freedom', 'Second', 'Series', 'Wrong', 'Man', 'OutEight', 'Men', 'Black', 'Sox', '1919', 'World', 'Series']",N/A

""Make way for the Clean Sox!""; ""Ya gotta pitch them one at a time."" - spare me. Seems like all he did for research on the era was view old Hollywood baseball films and read anecdotes about the Black Sox.Another bad decision on the director's part is acting in his own film. His sarcastic singing in the train scene is the low part of the movie. The part about the selection of Landis as baseball commissioner is a farce. Could have been a great period piece about the times and America's early infatuation with the pastime. Instead, a cartoonish version of the story is presented. Sayles strikes out.Sayles is one of my most favorite American writer-directors. His film editing, his script doctoring on other Hollwood scripts, his fiction, his acting - I admire them all, but this is one of his films that just doesn't work. MATEWAN, CITY OF HOPE and LONE STAR are American classics that I feel will be greatly revered in decades to come - but with what he accomplishes in those three films, he fails quite badly at wiith 8 MEN OUT. Normally, Sayles has no problem handling a large ensemble of characters, but by spreading the Black Sox scadal story over the players, the owners, the gamblers and the reporters - the film seems to not have any focus, any real point of view. The gamblers say this in one room, the players say this in another and then time for some more baseball playing. There isnt much depth here while in LONE STAR and the others, literally every character on screen has dimension and weight. That's not to say this film doesn't have it's moments: a great cast of under-used actors like Michael Rooker, Don Harvey and D.B. Sweeney, plus solid work from Sayles veterans Straitharn and Gordon Clapp. It's nicely acted but the script needed a few more drafts.

In the early 20th century, baseball players were barely payed enough money to live on, so when organized crime stepped in and offered a big pay day for throwing the 1919 World Series, half the team said yes. The film Eight Men Out is based on the book by Eliot Asinof, the first to officially tell the story of what happened. Until this book, people knew the outcome, but not the particulars. While the book goes into great detail, the movie does not. The film gives us the basics in a very simplistic form, in order to make it more dramatic, and that's the one part of this film I didn't really care for. The things I really wanted to know more about never seemed to materialize and a lot of what we saw in return was the Hollywood exaggeration effect. Don't get me wrong though, the film was very entertaining as it showed a lot of the action on the field and touched on some aspects of the scandal. The acting was stellar and it was really fun to see Charlie Sheen and John Cusack right as they were first starting out. As for the ending, well that was expected, but I still really enjoyed the sports action, back stories, and even the over the top dramatics surrounding the story.

However, after doing a little research behind the 1919 Black Sox scandal, I now understand. They did what they did because Charlie Comiskey cared more about the profits in his pockets than he did about the players who played on his team. His greed and selfishness in not paying team members a decent wage made it rather easy for team members to throw some games for a propositioned profit. EIGHT MEN OUT does an excellent job of portraying Comiskey's avarice and illustrating the motivation of the eight men who were thrown out of the game.Buck Weaver was the true victim in the whole scandal because even though he was not a part of affair, he had knowledge of it and failed to inform his coach. The movie shows Weaver as the type of man he really was and its a shame he wasn't and hasn't been given a fair shake. The film also does a good job at illustrating the questions surrounding &quot;Shoeless&quot; Joe Jackson. Jackson was thrown out for throwing a game, but he was basically the MVP of the entire series; all he cared about was the game, not the money. Was Joe really a criminal or a simple hick caught up in something bigger than he could deal with?EIGHT MEN OUT is a really good sports movie.

The movie takes its time spinning the story and accords quite a bit of time to making the case for why the White Sox players would engage in this behavior.  Making the players more sympathetic is a smart move, although of perhaps questionable accuracy.First, the pluses....The movie looks terrific and director Sayles obviously put a great deal of effort into recreating the time period.  The story is also inherently interesting, even to this non-fan of baseball.  The acting is uniformly good, and many of the actors went on to great careers, particularly John Cusak.  Charlie Sheen also puts in one of his best performances.  Some of the actors were regulars in Sayles' films, including David Strathairn.Unfortunately, the movie was not particularly emotionally involving.  The story is told primarily from the point-of-view of the baseball players.  The public reaction is largely left out of the film, except for the famous scene where a young boy pleads to Joe Jackson, ""Say it ain't so Joe.""  Including more of these types of scenes may have made the film more emotional.  Of course, Sayles tends to be a rather unsentimental director, so his approach is not surprising.
