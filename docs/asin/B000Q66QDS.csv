Philip Gardiner interviews Mr. Tim Wallace-Murphy, a fascinating man you can't help but want to invite to your next dinner party.  This guy could read the phone book and make it seem epic and mysterious.  More than once I wrote some of his claims down while watching, so that I could research them on my own.  A few trips to the library later I was able to vouch for Mr. Wallace.  There are oodles of little known facts contained on this DVD, facts that you'd otherwise have to spend days in the back of the library sifting through dusty manuscripts to discover.

I know quite a few of them who, knowing that, say So what? Does it matter?"" What matter, he says, is what they are doing with their own lives now.
