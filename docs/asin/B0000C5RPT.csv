773597,A1K31NF81TS0CO,B0000C5RPT,"Dubyac99 ""Dubyac99""","[1, 6]","Okay first things first.  I really love the theme song.  It was probably my favorite theme song of all time, better than Hill Street, better than NYPD, even better than Greatest American Hero.  I really love this show's theme music, and I rarely skipped over the intro, when it would come on.I enjoyed seeing many familiar faces in this show, extras, regulars, even extra regulars.  I recognized just about every individual from previous joint efforts of this production team.  Michael DeLuise (Officer Phil Roussakoff), as Detective Sipowicz's son, in NYPD Blue,  was one of my favorite recurring roles, for instance.  Or Titus Welliver (Officer Jack Lowrey), who played a ""scrubs"" claden doctor in several recurring roles in NYPD Blue.  Or even Gary Basaraba (Sargent Santoro) , from one of my favorites, Boomtown (sheesh, can't this guy get a break?).  And of course, Dylan Walsh (Jimmy Doyle), a major character in Nip/Tuck.While I thought this was a well written drama for television, it fell into the same category of NYPD Blue, where we got to see partial nudity, and heard lots of salty language.  Well, guess what:?  I have a problem with that.  Even though NYPD Blue is one of my favorite television dramas, and there was plenty of this in that show too.  Where does this producer get off showing that stuff in multiple shows?  How come this didn't take precedence in future shows produced by him?  The reason is, because it was a bunch of crup.  (sic)  No regular television show should be allowed to show this partial nudity, or jam salty language down our throat.  And whose ever wheels he greased to get it green lighted by the Censors, was just a bunch of political nonsense, and should not have been tolerated.  I'm sorry, that's my opinion!That being said, I really enjoyed this series.  It was quite interesting, and full of surprises.  I think one reason it may have failed to catch on with an audience, is because, aside from the Pilot show, there was no extreme or ""kick you in the teeth"" surprising segments.  It mainly had to do with cops feelings, and reaching out to Brass, to smooth things over, etc.  It was quite boring some shows, and as another reviewer mentioned, left me looking at my watch.  I remember watching the original airing of the Pilot.  I actually memorized the movement of the black suspect, as he shot up folks on the street.  I think it was repeated many times in the Promotional advertising, because when I saw it, I immediately had a flashback to watching this scene multiple times.And this was the only show I had any recollection of seeing on tv, so what that tells me, is I stopped watching after the first or second show.I give this one 3 stars, mainly for okay story-lines, and great music.  I would have given it 4 stars, but I can't look past the gratuitous nudity, and salty language, which should not be broadcast on network television programs.MC White said:  Just a'iiight.",3,Just a'iiight!,1164758400,"11 29, 2006",2006,2932,"['Okay', 'first', 'things', 'first', 'really', 'love', 'theme', 'song', 'was', 'probably', 'favorite', 'theme', 'song', 'time', 'better', 'Hill', 'Street', 'better', 'NYPD', 'even', 'better', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Hero', 'really', 'love', 'show', 'theme', 'music', 'rarely', 'skipped', 'intro', 'when', 'would', 'come', 'on.I', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'many', 'familiar', 'show', 'extras', 'regulars', 'even', 'extra', 'regulars', 'recognized', 'just', 'about', 'individual', 'previous', 'joint', 'efforts', 'production', 'team', 'Michael', 'DeLuise', 'Officer', 'Phil', 'Roussakoff', 'Detective', 'Sipowicz', 'son', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'recurring', 'roles', 'instance', 'Titus', 'Welliver', 'Officer', 'Jack', 'Lowrey', 'who', 'played', 'scrubs', 'claden', 'doctor', 'several', 'recurring', 'roles', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'even', 'Gary', 'Basaraba', 'Sargent', 'Santoro', 'one', 'favorites', 'Boomtown', 'sheesh', 'ca', ""n't"", 'guy', 'get', 'break', 'course', 'Dylan', 'Walsh', 'Jimmy', 'Doyle', 'major', 'character', 'Nip/Tuck.While', 'thought', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'drama', 'television', 'fell', 'same', 'category', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'where', 'got', 'see', 'partial', 'nudity', 'heard', 'lots', 'salty', 'language', 'Well', 'guess', 'what', 'have', 'problem', 'Even', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'one', 'favorite', 'television', 'dramas', 'there', 'was', 'plenty', 'show', 'too', 'Where', 'producer', 'get', 'off', 'showing', 'stuff', 'multiple', 'shows', 'How', 'come', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'precedence', 'future', 'shows', 'produced', 'reason', 'was', 'bunch', 'crup', 'sic', 'regular', 'television', 'show', 'should', 'be', 'allowed', 'show', 'partial', 'nudity', 'jam', 'salty', 'language', 'down', 'throat', 'ever', 'greased', 'get', 'green', 'lighted', 'Censors', 'was', 'just', 'bunch', 'political', 'nonsense', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'tolerated', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'opinion', 'being', 'said', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'was', 'quite', 'interesting', 'full', 'surprises', 'think', 'one', 'reason', 'may', 'have', 'failed', 'catch', 'audience', 'aside', 'Pilot', 'show', 'was', 'extreme', 'kick', 'teeth', 'surprising', 'segments', 'mainly', 'had', 'do', 'cops', 'feelings', 'reaching', 'out', 'Brass', 'smooth', 'things', 'etc', 'was', 'quite', 'boring', 'shows', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'left', 'looking', 'watch', 'remember', 'watching', 'original', 'airing', 'Pilot', 'actually', 'memorized', 'movement', 'black', 'suspect', 'up', 'folks', 'street', 'think', 'was', 'repeated', 'many', 'times', 'Promotional', 'advertising', 'when', 'saw', 'immediately', 'had', 'flashback', 'watching', 'scene', 'multiple', 'times.And', 'was', 'only', 'show', 'had', 'recollection', 'seeing', 'tv', 'what', 'stopped', 'watching', 'first', 'second', 'show.I', 'give', 'one', '3', 'stars', 'mainly', 'okay', 'story-lines', 'great', 'music', 'would', 'have', 'given', '4', 'stars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'look', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'salty', 'language', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'broadcast', 'network', 'television', 'programs.MC', 'White', 'said', 'Just', ""a'iiight""]",N/A

773603,A3FDO58UAHVQD1,B0000C5RPT,Servo,"[33, 35]","Brooklyn South was a stellar police drama from producer Steven Bochco which ran on CBS for a single season. The show was basically a 90s update on Bochco's earlier cop ensemble series Hill Street Blues, but with more edge. Brooklyn South was just as great as NYPD Blue (another Bochco production) but failed to pull in the numbers CBS wanted to justify another season. Where on NYPD Blue the focus was on the work and personal lives of the detectives, Brooklyn South focused on the sector patrol - the ""beat cops"" - while flawed, still exhibited glowing pride in their work. This is exemplified in the show's patriotic opening theme by veteran composer Mike Post.Although Brooklyn South featured great storylines and performances, CBS seemed to suffer from the ""single season curse"" whenever they put out a new quality drama. Brooklyn South, EZ Streets, Turks, and Michael Hayes were ALL quality shows that never made it past one season due to poor viewership, despite good reviews. Though with Michael Hayes, I always suspected that viewers still harbored resentment [at the time] toward David Caruso for leaving NYPD Blue so early in its run.After Brooklyn South ended several of the cast members went on to more successful projects, not surprisingly, police drama-related. Richard T. Jones (Officer Clement Johnson) went on to star in Judging Amy; Yancy Butler (Officer Ann-Marie Kersey) starred as the heroine in Witchblade; Gary Basaraba (Sgt. Richard Santoro) stars in  Boomtown; Klea Scott (Officer Nona Valentine) appeared as a Pre-Crime cop in Minority Report; and Adam Rodriguez (Officer Hector Villanueva) formerly of Roswell, stars in CSI: Miami.I can't recommend this DVD enough. The episodes themselves are MORE than enough to justify the purchase. This DVD could signal the future release of those other great shows I mentioned earlier. Man, the possibilities are definitely expanding now! Think how cool it would be to own DVDs of Reasonable Doubts or Murder One - both with TWO SEASONS under their belts.

Too bad, because there was a decent ensemble cast and plenty of storylines, both professional and personal and sometimes both, to keep it going for a while.The series is all about a police precinct and the men and women who work there, as well as their private lives, conflicts, relationships, sacrifices, etc.I don't know if there was all that much chemistry among some of the actors, but for the most part they seemed to mesh most of the time.This is worth checking out if you like the people involved with it and if you don't mind seeing yet another cop show.",4,Decent cop show that should have lasted longer,1283472000,"09 3, 2010",2010,635,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'here', 'show', 'lasted', 'only', 'one', 'season', 'Too', 'bad', 'was', 'decent', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'plenty', 'storylines', 'professional', 'personal', 'sometimes', 'keep', 'going', 'while.The', 'series', 'police', 'precinct', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'work', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'private', 'lives', 'conflicts', 'relationships', 'sacrifices', 'etc.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'much', 'chemistry', 'actors', 'most', 'part', 'seemed', 'mesh', 'most', 'time.This', 'checking', 'out', 'like', 'people', 'involved', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'yet', 'cop', 'show']",N/A
